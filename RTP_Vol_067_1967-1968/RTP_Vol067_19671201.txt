Randolph-Macon Program
Presents Aspects Of Poverty

The YWCA_ of Randolph-Macon
Woman's College in Lynchburg is
sponsoring today and tomorrow a

symposium on poverty, entitled “Can

We Afford the Poor?”
Dr. Henry Clark, Professor of Re-
ligion at Duke University, Claude

Brown, author of “Manchild and the
Promised Land” and a_ speaker at
WKL’s Contact in 1966, and Dr.
Bennetta Washington, Director of
Women’s Center, Job Corps, are
scheduled to address the symposium
on Saturday.

Experienced and knowledgeable
about the theme of the seminar,
each will discuss various aspects of
the subject. Clark will discuss the
relationship of education to poverty,
Brown, the economics, and Dr. Wash-
ington, the role of government in
the war on poverty.

Tonight at 8:30 the symposium will
begin with a _ recpetion for the
speakers at Casner Lounge. A
movie, “I’m Here Now,” will follow
this, and a discussion session will be
held afterwards.

Subject of Film

“Michelangelo,” a color television
film, will be shown in duPont Hall
on December 10 and 11 at 8 p.m.

The one-hour motion picture is be-
ing brought to Washington and Lee
by the Virginia Gas Company.

Dr. Sterling Boyd, assistant
fessor in fine arts, says the film
“should be excellent. It deals with
the painting, sculpture and architec-
ture of the great Renaissance artist.”

Although the showing is scheduled
mainly for students in the Italian
Renaissance fine arts course, it is
open to everyone in the area.

This will be the second time that
this film has been presented at WAL.

Last year the full two-hour length
version was shown. Since then, it has

been cut in half.

ers will be held at 2:45 p.m. at
Smith Auditorium and will precede
discussion groups, to be organized at
4 p.m. The latter will be on the
subjects of Economics and Poverty,
at Alumnae Lounge, Education and
Poverty, in Smith Lounge, and Gov-
ernment and Poverty.

The symposium will end with an
informal discussion with the speakers
in Casner Lounge at 7 p.m.

UFOCC, Circle K
Clothing Drive Nets
Record Collections

In their clothing drive ending be-
fore Thanksgiving vacation, UFOCC
and Circle K_ collected over 600
articles of clothing, John Carrere,
chairman of the drive, reported.

Carrere said that the drive was not
only numerically successful, but that
most of the clothes were of good
quality and included many warm
coats.

The drive probably will become an
annual affair, Carrere predicated.
Initiated by the Rockbridge County
Welfare Department, the drive col-
lected clothes to be used exclusively
by the needy in the county. Mrs.
William Buchanon co-ordinated the
drive with the towns people.

Carrere especially commended con-
tributions by the Law Wives’ Associa-
tion and the PiPhis. Other groups
who supported the drive enthusias-
tically were SAE, Lambda Chi, Delt,
Sigma Nu, Phi Kap, DU, Phi Delt,
and the upperclass dorm.

Carrere, a Delt, was helped by
Bob Brigham of the Law School and
Bill Ridley, SAE and president of
Circle K.

Student Literary

Society Formed
Thursday Night

A new organization came into
existence last night in the form of a
student literary society.

Under the auspices of Mike Nation,
its founder, and Dabney Stuart,

as-
sistant professor of English, the fac-
ulty advisor, the club hopes to re-
place previous creative writing as-

sociations, either defunct or presently
serving other purposes.

The primary goals of the club are
first, to give the students a voice in
contracting or writing to prominent
writers to speak at Washington and
Lee, and secondly, to allow students

to have their own works read and
discussed by both students and fac-
ulty members.

The organizational committee
elected at a meeting on Thursday

night were Mike Nation, Bernie Feld,
Mark Faverman, Dave Walder, Kirk
Woodward, Steve Greenia and Dick
Batton, The Committee met immedi-
after the main meeting and
drew up the club's tentative organiza-
tion, subject to approval at the next
meeting (Wednesday, December 6 at
in Evan’s Dining Hall). At
this time a name for the organization

i will be discussed.

The club is planning to apply for
funds from the Executive Committee
in order to contract speakers, It in-
tends to form a coalition with other
| literary organizations.

It is hoped that the organization
will be able to honor those students
in the junior and senior classes who
have made outstanding contributions

Too Many Doctors

Ah, traditions. They make one’s heart pop out in flags,
bugles, and old fight songs.

Except one. That old, old business about referring to
every professor or instructor or visiting lecturer you see as
“doctor,” which is easily the tiredest tradition around. And
unfortunately, unlike a number of more respectable traditions
at W&L, this particular practice seems likely to stay with us
for a long time.

Can there be any professor (or instructor, or visting lec-
turer) around who is still flattered at being called “doctor’’?
Probably not. Yet the first thing the blithe freshman learns
is to address every balding individual over 25 whom he sees
as “doctor.” The ones who really are Ph.D.’s find the title
debased by so much use. (We hope.) The ones who aren’t
are embarrassed by it. (We hope.) Actually, we don’t even
really need to look to the faculty to find the perpetrators of
this hoary flattery. This is the case of one tradition which is
being held up by the students in the face of faculty opposition.

One professor, who is so consistently called ‘‘doctor” that
it’s beginning to sound like part of his last name, has suggested
that students at Southern schools are more attracted to titles
than students at Northern schools. The same instinct which
hatched hundreds of Southern “colonels” after the Civil War
is apparently still at work. The only thing wrong with this
explanation is the fact that at the University of Virginia, which
is as Southern as W&L can claim to be, a simple “Mr.” seems
sufficient.

An advice-to-the-lovelorn column (Amy Vanderbilt, no
less) recently ran a letter on the subject by a Columbia pro-
fessor. For what it’s worth, we reprint part of what he said:

“At most leading universities it is assumed that all per-
sons of professional rank (assistant to full) will have a Ph.D.
Hence they are called ‘professor, and not ‘doctor.’ In the
East, at social gathering, ‘Mr.’ is the most common form of
introduction for a professor, it being thought convenient not
to confuse the other guests by a misleading mention of
‘doctor.’

“In small, run-of-the-mill colleges it is likely that pro-
fessors are plentiful and doctors (Ph.D.’s) rare; so it often
happens that the title of doctor is made much of—in print
and in speech.”

Two Attend RPI Conference

 

Sandler Recommends EC Join V.A.S.G.

By STEVE SANDLER
Sophomore
Executive Committteeman

The Virginia Association of Stu-
dent Governments is an organization
of twenty-three colleges and universi-
ties in the state of Virginia, Its pur-
pose is to bring together the various
ideas and problems of the members
such that each school is in some way
aided.

On November 15, Danny Leonard
and I attended the VASG Fall Con-
ference at the Richmond Professional
Institute. We were invited to this con-

|ference so that we could view the
| workings of the association in hopes
| that Washington and Lee join.

Need for Communication

At the luncheon Lt. Governor
Fred Pollard summed up the im-
portance of VASG, stating, “as col-
|leges in Virginia continue to grow,
| there is a greater need for communi-
|cation among them.” VASG would
be the means by which W&L could
take advantage of this communica-
tion.

The VASG is not associated with
the National Student Association.
The organization does not have a

 

 

 

national political affiliation or stand,
nor are there indications that such
a stand will be adopted.

Twelve Committees

There are twelve standing commit-
tees which meet at each of the four
conferences held each year. Some of
these committees are self-explanatory,
while others may require elucidation:

Editors Committee—composite and
exchange of means and procedures
aimed at improvement of college and
university newspapers.

Student-Teacher Evaluation Com-
mittee.

Honor Court Committee—we can

New Magazines Are Only Fair To Poor

By RON KESSLER

The Ring-tum Phi receives weekly
a preponderance of letters from vari-
ous sources requesting free publicity
for everything from trips to Tahiti
to spot announcements about tele-
vision shows sponsored by “that with-
it company, Pepsi.”

Last week, we received a copy of
Cheetah Magazine, and a letter sug-
gesting that we review it because
“Cheetah is the only magazine on
the stands which is edited by people
who know what's really happening.”
We now know that “what's really
happening” is that the whole world
is full of smiling, rich, exuberant
teeny-boppers of all ages.

Muddling through the rest of our
mail, we found Moderator, which we
receive since we are leading students,
and Moderator is “the national maga-
zine for leading students” (addressed:
MAN RING-TUM BUS).

Finally we find Avant Garde, sent
to us not because we are anything,
but because we sent them five bucks
Avant Garde is Ralph Ginzbureg’s
newest entrepreneurial endeavor, fol-
lowing Eros (Resting In Peace due
to a Federal Court decision), and Fact
(presumably and hopefully Resting
In Peace due to the Fact that it was
lousy). Avant Garde claims itself to
dedicated to the

future.”

Moderator has established itself a

» serious student magazine. It was
st one time distributed gratia to any
mal iudent who washed for it, bu |

it now is available for $3.00 per
year, except to “qualified male stu-
dents” who still receive it without
charge.

Editorial policy is expounded
thoughout the magazine, and is lib-
eral, supporting draft reform (volun-
tary), et. al. In its November issue,
| Moderator lists members of the Stu-
jdent Establishment, subheaded New
| Left (Bertrand Russell, Ho Chi Minh),
| Student Power (no southern college
|is represented), Student Press (Ring-
}tum Phi is ommitted (!), UNC Tar-
heel and Daily Texan are included),
On The Right (Moise Tshombe, Barry
Goldwater), and Hippies with campus

impact (Allen Ginsberg, Timothy
Leary).
Moderator awards a monthly

GLOF (General Lack of Fiber) award.
In November, this award went to
the College News Bureau which
“issues a news release to immortalize
what would otherwise be all too
mortal,”

AVANT GARDE

Ihe background to Avant Garde
is more interesting than most of the
articles in its first issue. Several years
ago, Ralph Ginzburg put out a maga-
zine called Eros, a publication en-
| titled “The Housewife’s Handbook
on Selective Promiscuity,” and the
newsletter “Liaison.” These were dis-
| tributed through the U.S. mails. Eros
was designed to “deal joyously with
the subjects of love and sex.” Evi-
dently, a Federal Court in Phila-
delphia did not enjoy Eres; Ginzburg
was convicted in 1963 for mailing

 

'

|

|

 

 

obscene literature.

While fighting this conviction in
higher courts (his conviction was up-
held by the Supreme Court in 1966),
Ginzburg published Fact, an absurd,
boring, and poorly edited expose
magazine, which we have not seen
recently, and which we presume no
longer exists,

Several months ago, advertisements
appeared in various publications
across the country in which a pro-
vocalive young woman expounded
“a proposition,” i.¢., a subscription
to “the most exciting and beautiful
new magazine in the country” for
just half price, and the right to
renew forever (which may not be
very long if Ginzburg’s luck holds
out) at that price.

So, we subscribed (the editorial
“we” meaning “me,” not the R-t P).
Issue number one features a scurril-
ous Faet-like article on Richard
Nixon, illustrated with caricatures of
Nixon in the form of a barker, devil,
Abe Lincoln on stilts, hawk, and
dunce. Ht asserts that he is “dumb

. tasteless . . . has little integrity

. & hypocrite [and] is intemperate”
among other euphemisms

Next is “The Hate Mail of Captain
Levy.” This is simply a publication
of the letters written to Army Captain
Howard Levy, now in prison for re-
fusing to teach Vietnam-destined
“Green Berets.” Many of the letters
are incredibly repulsive, obviously
written by some incredibly repulsive
human beings. In spite of the fact
that you know these kind of people

How The R.O.T.C.
Will Win The War

By BERNIE FELD

(Washington and Lee is fortunate
this year to have distinguished visit-
ing lecturer in military science Brig.
Gen. Lucius B. McPhite, who is cur-
rently on leave from a small liberal
arts college nestled in the foothills of
the Mekong Delta about 150 miles
southeast of Saigon. The following
is a transcript of an interview with
Gen. McPhite.)

R-t Phi: Gen. McPhite, what is
your opinion of war?

MePhite: I'm for
it, son,

R-t Phi: Is that
your feeling on
Vietnam, also?

McPhite: That's
a war, isn’t it?

R-+t Phi: Yes, |
guess it is. But
what about the
statement that
some people make
that the army's job Feld
is to keep the
peace, do you agree with that?

McPhite: You betcha. And if we
don't go over there to Vietnam and
fight with those Krauts—excuse me,
Chinks—how the hell can we expect
to keep the peace?

R-t Phi: Hm, | hadn't thought of
it like that.

McPhite: Besides that, the war's
going to be over soon

R-t Phi: How do you know that?

MecPhite: Gen. Westeybrook says
that after that last battle the V¢
can't hold out much longer

R-+t Phi: Yes, but do you think he's
in & position to know? After all he
was in Washington, D. C., when that
battle was fought,

McPhite: Of course he was Do
you think anyone in his right mind
would be over there?

R-t Phi: Well it's good to know that
whoever's running that war is sane

(Suddenly shouts from the next
room: Come on, Wimperly, KILL!
KILL! You get a C plus, Wimp
erly, you didn't do your homework.)

R-t Phi: Say, what's that in there”?

MecPhite: That's one of our study
rooms, We like to call it the leader
ship laboratory

R4 Phi: That's understandable
What kind of courses do you have?

MecPhite: First there's the survey
course, Maim 101 and Kill 102~it's
linked. We have a course on self
defeme—How To Wipe Out an
Enemy Brigade with a Mess Kit: a
survival course on how to tell a good
Vietnamese from a bad Vietnamese
Shoot First and Ask Questions Later
and a course on military protocol
How To Polish Brass Buttons With
a Bamboo Shoot. Then for the really
advanced students, we have

Tucked insignificantly in a
corner of the basement of
Doremus Gym, next to the
equipment and laundry rooms,
is the office of Coach Verne
Canfield and his right hand
man, Coach Tom Davies. Odd
place for the man who guided
his charges to a 20-5 record
last winter, you say? Unfortu-
nately for General opponents, oceania
pre-season reports hint that Coach Canfield spends his only
time in the depths while he is in his office.

The Big Blue Basketball forces should be top rate. Co-
captains Rob Bauer and Jody Kline will head a veteran team
into a beefed-up schedule, but conversation around Lexington
seems to indicate that the concensus supports an approxima-
tion of last year’s fine record.

When interviewed, Coach Canfield said that any changes
in the offense and defense would be slight. He said that the
Generals attack would perhaps be more simplified than last
year, but would still feature the 1-3-1 setup.

 

Guard
Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.

On defense, the Generals will stick with the man-to-man
and match-up alignments. Coach Canfield warned that his boys
could be expected to press on defense in an effort to control
the tempo. The veteran coach said that he expects to see lots
of zone defenses and full court presses to slow down his team’s
free-wheeling attack.

Out to Get The Generals

Pre-season workouts have stressed the execution of funda-
mentals, this week especially in the outside shooting depart-
ment. Coach Canfield listed a number of things that would
be important in every game. First of all, the Generals must
play their own game, which, as last year’s fans will remember,
included both a disciplined offense and defense and a running
attack when the opportunity was presented. More of the same
is to be expected this year. The threat of the fast break will
be present but “the good percentage shot will be the key” to
Washington and Lee’s offense. Control of both the offensive
and defensive boards will be a must. Coach Canfield looks for
more low-scoring games this season and will be ready for any-
thing and everything as most opponents will be “out to get
WéeL.”

The Generals most definitely have the personnel to put
all this theory into practice. Number One on everybody’s list
must be Mel Cartwright, last year’s All-Everything. Mel, a
6-6 sophomore from Martinsville, Va., led the team in nearly
every category, and did not limit himself to offensive heroics.
He was a sturdy defender and rugged rebounder, as well as
prolific scorer. His 20.1 scoring average was a key factor in
the hardcourt renaissance at Washington and Lee.

But the Big Blue will be far from a one-ring circus this
winter. Lending able help both as a scorer and rebounder
will be another sophomore, 6-6 Mal Wesselink. An all-CAC
selection like Cartwright, “Mean Mal’’ teams effectively with
“Magic Mel” in the forecourt.

Other team members to watch are numerous. Transfer
student Mike Neer, a 6-7 sophomore who high jumps nearly
as high as he stands, will be just that much more dynamite
for opponents to handle. Guard John Carrere combines speed
with his excellent outside shooting to pose a potent threat
whether the Generals are running or setting up patterns.

Of course, the “old-timers” will be of great importance.
Jody Kline, Rob Bauer, and Earl Edwards will be around to
steady the youngsters and display their own considerable tal-

Season Opens Tonight

ents. Bauer, if healthy, will be seeking to regain the All-State
ranking he held as a freshman.

The Generals’ bench could be the best around and you
can bet that such names as Fauber, Morrison, Stone, and
Rhyne will appear in the lineup often throughout the season.
All but Rhyne, who is a freshman from Marianna, Florida,
saw considerable action last year and fans will remember Nor-
wood’s dead-eye jumpers, Stu’s hustle on the boards, and
Charlie’s all-around floor play. Coach Canfield will lose
nothing talent-wise when he looks for a substitute.

Injuries For Opener

In fact, in looking toward tonight’s opener at Bridgewater,
the coach reported that of the ten boys who will dress, “every-
body could start.” There will be some question marks due to
injuries, however. Carrere is out with a sprained ankle and
Bauer has an injured hand which makes his status questionable.
This makes the tentative lineup include the three big boys
Neer, Cartwright, and Wesselink, along with either Stone or
Morrison, with captain Jody Kline on the point.

In the Eagles, who split a two-game series with W&L last
year, the Generals will find no pushover. Canfield has de-
scribed them as “pesky,” and their two stars Jim Upperman
at 6-4 and Eddie Cook, a 6-1 outside threat, could produce
the upset. In fact, these two helped get the Generals off on
the wrong foot last year when Brigewater defeated the home
team in the Doremus opener 83-71. But the Generals have
come a long way since then.

Tonight will also mark the opening of the J-V season.
The preliminary will send W&L’s junior varsity into action
at 6:00. The rest of the varsity season will be highlighted
by the Randolph-Macon tournament, featuring Lycoming,
Pa., W&L, Maryville, Tenn., and the host Jackets. A big game
for the Generals will be the struggle with Southern Conference
member East Carolina. And of course Washington and Lee
will want to defend its CAC basketball championship at the
season’s end. These games will be featured on the radio, but
students shouldn’t miss the “live” performances. Maybe Coach
Canfield moved downstairs to avoid the limelight. There should
be a lot of it this season.

Opening a basketball season on the
road can sometimes be compared to
a rigged game of Russian Roulette.
Enthusiasm for a season opener at
home is usually reflected in an over-
flow crowd, noise, freshly scrubbed
cheerleaders, noise, keyed-up teams,
and more noise. For the unfortunate
visitors, added attractions may in-
clude hot pennies, paper clips, boos, |

opener for both teams. Later in the
season, WAL edged Bridgewater 64-
62 on the Eagles’ hardwood. Bridge-
water, like any other team, will re-
member that loss (and if the players
don't, the coaches will be sure to
remind them), and will be doing its
best to use its home advantage.
While the home-court edge is a
natural phenomenon throughout bas-
ketball, it is generally acknowledged
that some gymnasiums are “edgeier”
than others. A_ classic example is
Witchita’s famed “Snake Pit,” terror
of of the Missouri Valley Conference.
While Bridgewater is no Witchita and
Bridgewater Gymnasium is no “Snake
Pit,” the Eagles do possess an ample
supply of boisterous fans who would
like nothing better than to see their
team start the year with an upset
over WAL, and will not be above
using their lungpower to help bring
this about. Besides this, there are the

 

twin factors of revenge (last year's
i loss and this year’s football Home-
lcoming defeat) and the not-to-be-
| forgotien fact that a “rich boy-poor
| boy” rivalry does exist between the
| schools, at least in the minds of
loyal Bridgewaterians.

A complaint expressed by a couple

bers’ completely ignoring someone
they do not like and making him
