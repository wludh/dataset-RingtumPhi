W@L Glee Club Presents
Program With RMWC
At Lee Chapel Tonight

The Washington and Lee and the
Randolph-Macon Women’s glee clubs
will be in concert together at 8 p.m.
tonight in Lee Chapel. It will be
WA&L’s fourth concert in two days
and their second with Randolph-
Macon.

Thursday morning the club was at
Roanoke College in Salem, Va., in
a joint program with Roanoke’s choir.
That afternoon Washington and Lee
taped a television special at WDBJ
in Roanoke. The special, which will

be shown al a later date, was pro-
duced entirely by students from
WAL’s School of Journalism and
Communications. The day was

brought to a close with an evening
concert with Randolph-Macon in the

Hotel Roanoke.
Included in tonight’s repertoire is
Gustov Horst’s “Dirge from Two

Veterans”, which the club is dedicat-
ing to the men in Vietnam. Selections
from Bach, Braham, Vaughn, and
Thompson have been chosen to aug
ment the evening's entertainment.

A medley of show music will serve
to contrast the program; including
“Falling in Love,” “Try to Remem-
ber,” and “Grand Night for Singing.”
The club's tribute to Good Friday
will take the form of Mazart's “La-

height of Greek Week activities Thurs-
day night remarked, “I believe that
the fraternity system at Washington
and Lee is here indefinitely.”

Speaking before fraternity mem-
bers, Huntley used the occasion to
outline the possible future of the Uni-
versity, especially with respect to fra-
ternities.

Some of the possibilities discussed
included the building of new dorms
and other ways of “providing an
alternative to fraternity life,” require-
ments that students live in either
dormitories or fraternity houses and
future University loans to fraterni-
ties.

Huntley listed some forces at work
which “may weaken fraternities,” in-
cluding deferred rush, “the abandon-
ment of fraternities by fraternity
men,” and “University efforts to pro-

vide alternatives” to non-fraternity
men,

One of the big questions on the
campus today, Huntley said, is}

“Should we have as an objective the}

making of a residential college?” He
remarked, “It would be my hope that

we could make all choices available |
including dorms, frat-|

to students,”
ernity houses, and apartments. How-
ever, he added, “I am not sure if it
would be economically possible to
create all these alternatives.”
Huntley's speech followed an ad-

the future of fraternities in the United

posed upon the student. In addition,
some professors felt that the material
covered in the first eight weeks did
not lend itself to testing.

Reasons against the motion includ-
ed the feeling that it was important
for students and parents to have some
idea of the work done up to that
time. Others thought there might be
some way of evaluating students’ work
by means other than quizzes.

The midsemester grades were re-

The proposal for abolishing mid-
semester grades was first brought up
at the February faculty meeting and
referred to the Committee on Courses

proposal to all department chairmen,
who polled their staff. These results
were taken back to the committee
and were found to be overwhelmingly
in favor of the proposal.

Seven Years

The nationwide dismay at the assassination of Dr. Martin
Luther King was reflected in a special memorial service held
here Tuesday. It wasn’t a very ornate affair, nor was it even
particularly well-attended—the decision to hold it was only
made on Monday, and there was little time for publicity—
but the fact that such a service could be held here at all, only
a century after Appomatox, on the very anniversary of the
day Lee surrendered, and over Lee’s own tomb, is a remarkable
and significant event. Nor do we think that Lee himself would
have objected.

But the event was not only significant from the view-
point of W&L’s remote past. It was even more significant
and symbolic because only seven years ago, in October of
1961, the Board of Trustees of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity firmly and fiatly refused to allow Martin Luther King
to speak on this campus.

The idea had been brought up by the student executive
committee of the University Christian Association, which was
attempting to schedule a seminar on “Christian Ethics and
Non-Violent Protest in Race Relations.” Dr. King was to lead
the seminar.

The Faculty Committee on Christian Work, under whose
authority the UCA fell, recommended to the trustees and to
President Cole that the UCA be permitted to invite Dr. King.

The Board of Trustees refused to grant permission, and
declined to give a reason, although they obviously felt that it
would not be in the interests of Washington and Lee to have
Dr. King on campus.

Ironically, in the previous week faculty action had banned
the Hot Nuts from campus, so that in one week the University
was placed in the awkward position of classing Dr. Martin
Luther King with purveyors of obscene music.

That such a thing could be thought to be in the University’s
interests, and that this could happen only seven years ago, is
frankly astonishing to most students today. And it is a measure
of W&L’s good intentions that a great deal has been done
since then to change those attitudes. The King affair in 1961
raised such a furor not only here but throughout the state
that in the following year the trustees declared that a faculty
committee would have complete jurisdiction in the future over
deciding who could speak on campus. As a result, when the
UCA petitioned to have King again last year, the committee
granted the request (he was invited, but had to cancel out).
And last Monday, when the plans were made for the memorial
service, it was not even necessary to consult the trustees.

HE *

Where do we go from here? Whatever progress we've
made—and it hasn’t been small—is infinitesimal compared to
what remains. Our integration is token and likely to remain
that way for a long time. Our interest as a student body in the
racial problem is polite but unengaged, seldom real and often
purely academic. We talk about it here all the time but we
only repeat ourselves. The very things said in this editorial are
at best gropings in the dark; we are so removed from the
realities of the racial situation that we hardly even know how
to approach them. As a University, we remain loftily unaware
of social and economic conditions among the poor at our own
feet in Lexington and Rockbridge County. Our attitudes are
sympathetic, our actions few and, frankly, half-hearted. For
this, both the University and the student body bear equal
blame. It remains to be seen whether they will assume an
equal responsibility for the future.

Chastisement Dept.

We take this opportunity to recommend the remarks be
low to every W&L student for careful perusal and concerned
thought. Ir seems that the VMI student newspaper, the
“Cadet,” was editorializing about the new policy of unlimited
cuts for second semester First Classmen (who more or less
resemble our seniors), and it occurred to the editors to cast a
baleful glance down the road in our direction ee.

“One warning, we feel, should be issued at this time.
Some years ago, W&L, which we in the barracks often tend
to equate with the ideal civilian institution”

(Right away we began to wonder about the accuracy of
their information about Wael . Besides, they probably Say that
about all civilian schools.)

"which we in the barracks often tend to equate with
the ideal civilian institution, established a system of unlimited
class cuts for some of its students. For the first few months
instructors were faced with an incredible dearth of students,
Heads were shaken furiously, grades came out, and sud-
denly there was a profusion of learning-hungry students
beating a path to academic buildings. The implications are
clear. Too much of a good thing ceases to be a good thing
anymore,”

"It seems fairly certain that most of the men now enjoy-
ing this benefit will be wise enough to take advantage of it
properly. If nothing else, this may be an opportunity for
VMI to prove that cadets are more academically inclined
than the rival ‘Minks’. Let’s not have the sudden lack of
academic interest happen here.”

Indeed not.

It is my opinion that the caption

it was in error. The demonstrators

GREEK WEEK RELAY RACE:

 

Muhammed

Ali Speaks:

‘World Without Whites’

It was April Fool’s Day but it was
not put on. “He really is beautiful...
He is the greatest.” Cassius Clay's
visit to Fairleigh Dickinson Univer-
sity, Teaneck (N. J.) campus, brought
back to mind the days earlier in this
decade when this Black American was
truely a contemporary folk hero,

Since victory in the 1960 Olympics,
Clay—or Muhammed Ali as he would
be called—has been in the public
eye. This grandson of a former slave
became many things to many people
as he talked and boxed his way to
a heavyweight title fight with the
seemingly unbeatable Sonny Liston.
Most feared he would be anihilated.
To some his boasting and irreverence
on the scene of American athletics
where even white perofrmers choose
to remain soft-spoken demanded that
he meet defeat against Liston in
Miami Beach.

But most of all, Ali represented an
American success story. The kids on
every playground in the country,
segreagated or not, looked upon him
as a hero, From lily-white suburbs
to the most unhappy black ghettos,
people reacted to him. Beneath all
talk however was the realization that
this was a good boxer, later to be

proven great. And beneath it all,
he was recognized as part of the
American Dream. From slums to a

pinnacle for those who were to rise
no less than a tanned Frank Mer-
riwell. If America was truly a melt-
ing pot, on his rise to the heavy-
weight boxing championship of the
world, Muhammed Ali became a
target image for those who were to
rise from the mixing pot. Boxing had
always been the first of the stepping
stones to success for the waves of

American immigrants, the Italians,
the Irish, the Jews. And now it was
accepting another wave. Only this
One was from the depths and the

dregs of American society where the
Negro in the United States had been
placed. The boy from Louisville took
advantage of his opportunity,

So there was a lot behind the ova
tions that greeted the Champ as he
rose to speak at FDU on that windy
first day in April. But the chill was
left outside as the Boxer began. He
explained his present position as a
Black Muslim minister in the service
of Allah and the prophet Elijah Mu-
hammed. From there he called for
questions. The people were his fans
and he wanted to tell them all that
jhe could,

The reception may not have been
as favorable if the audience was not
college age students, and the more
liberal at that. These students
were liberals and their flag was waved

ones

at all times. They too were against
the draft. Ali’s radical views were
not enough to make him unaccept-

able or any less the hero. They too
had a gripe with the administration.
Ali

was never one to dodge an
answer. Years of Black Muslin in-
struction came to the front. It was

a symphonic response. The power and
force of the years of Negro life pro-
vided the background rhythm. To
that was added the craftmanship of
the Muslim woodwinds playing with
a man’s beliefs, whistling in the air
for all to hear. And every Negro
was represented in the champs answer
as the brass played out a wild R&B
sound. Ali talked with pride of his
Black heritage, every black had to

Nolan’s Sacrifice Fly In Fifth
Brings In Third Diamond Win

By THUNDER THORNTON

The Generals equaled last year’s
baseball win mark Wednesday by
nudging Oneonta State 3-2 in Lex-
ington. The victory put the winner's
won-lost record at three wins and
three losses. No Washington and Lee
baseball team has won more than
three in the last two years, so a
victory in today’s game at Lynchburg
(no score was available before the
paper went to press) would be a
milestone of sorts.

Washington and Lee scores came
in the second and fifth innings while
Oneonta pushed both — their
runs in the third.

Leading off for the Generals in the
second, Jim Wilson stroked a triple
and was in prime scoring position.
After Charlie Freret walked and Scott
McCrystal struck out, Jack Baizley
slashed a run scoring single. The next
run was plated when Steve Kalista
hit into a weird double play, with
Freret scoring before the final out
of the inning.

Nolan Scores

After Oneonta promptly tied the
score with their runs in the third, the
victors put the deciding score on the
board in the fifth. Sophomore catcher
Baizley led off by reaching base on
an error, then moved to second on
a base on balls to Kalista. Freshman
outfielder Ray Coates sacrificed both
runners around, and John Nolan
poled a sacrifice fly that sent Baizley
scurrying across the plate with the
ball game.

Although all the scoring was done

across

Baizely

for the day, it remained for this
year’s surprise fireman, Tom Mitchell,
to finish up and collect the win.
Mitchell, an all-conference outfielder,
came in to relieve starter Bill Ras-
mussen in the third and worked six
and two-thirds innings without giv-
ing up a run.

To date, Mitchell has worked
thirteen and one-third innings with-

and Rasmussen, with 2-0 and 1-0
records respectively, lead the staff in
pitching.

Wednesday's big hitters were Nolan
(2 for 3 and an RBI), Wilson (2 for
2 including a triple), Baizley (1 for
3 and an RBI), and Kalista with an
RBI. Wilson’s triple was his third of

the spring and helped boost his slug-
ging average to .765, to go with his
gaudy .412 batting mark.

Other leading hitters for the young
season are first sacker McCrystal at
.333 and Mitchell with a .292 mark.

Verne Canfield’s General netters
started on the road to a second con-

win over Richmond’s Spiders Tues-

day in Lexington.

Spotting two new faces in the line-
up, Washington and Lee swept all six
singles and took two of the three
doubles matches on their way to
victory.

lrommy Rueger, back at his familiar
number one spot, blasted Richmond's
Craig Cooley 6-0, 6-0. Hustling Ray
rurman, prepping for the defense of
his number two slot CAC crown,
easily handled Rick Brook, 6-2, 6-2.

Don McClure and Tom McJunkin,
both playing higher up the ladder
than last year, annexed victories at
numbers three and four respectively.
McClure fought off a determined first
set challenge to down Tim Tinsley

8-6; 6-0, and McJunkin rallied back
from a one-set deficit to clip the
Spiders’ Mat Matox, 3-6, 6-1, 6-1.
rhe last two singles victories were
especially pleasing to Canfield and
his “youth movement.” Freshman Bill

Gatlin, breaking into the line-up at
number five, breezed to a 6-0: 6-0
triumph, and Rick Armstrong, up
from his number one slot on last

year’s freshman team, posted an easy
6-2, 6-2 win at the number six posi-
tron.

In doubles action, Rueger and Tur-

In response to questions about some
expenditures on books for the Mock
Convention, Steve Saunders, chairman
of the Mock Convention, stated that
the books were needed for the pre-
paration of the platform and the
research behind it. The Mock Con-
vention has so far spent about $140
for the books that will become the
property of the interim coordinating
committee,

Saunders urged that the EC con-
sider making provision for space for
convention files in the new Student
Union because the future of the
Dutch Inn was in doubt.

Enforcement of conventional dress
in Commons was discussed as well as
the practice of sunbathing on the

ferred for a week.

Muhammed Ali Speaks:
‘World Without Whites’

(Continued from Page 2)

identify with what he said, His senti-
ments made sense,

“For years we have been beat
when we tried to integrate. Now we
have to go our own way. Being white
isn’t so great.” For three hundred
years the blackman has been giving
to America. To Ali, it was the sweat
of his black ancestors that oiled the
machinery of America—and he is
not far from wrong. “Now we take,
we've given long enough. We're going
to make a wrold without whites, Don’t
give us jobs, we don’t want hand
outs. Give us land, the land that we
have worked for three hundred years.
We will take care of ourselves.

And that was it. He didn’t want the
whites who came to cheer him. He
didn’t care about the ones who came
to boo, The students tried to be
accepted by him. Girls best described
as tough said—we like you no matter
what your color is. And Ali liked
that, he is still a ladies man. But he
only knew hate and bitterness when-
ever he tried to mix with whites.
There is no man who ever learns to
accept that sort of treatment, the
treatment that Negroes in America
get everyday.

Greek Week Contest Winner

Sazeracs

To Appear
On TV Show

For the member of the Sazeracs,
W&L’s informal singing group,
Spring Holidays meant an unexpected
TV debut on the daytime program
“Treasure Island,”

This year the group had been per-
forming at the Taboo Club in Riviera
Beach, Florida, during vacation. Hav-
ing some free time, some of the mem-
bers inadvertently came across a film-
ing session for “Treasure Island.”
When the session was completed, a
lady connected with the program ap-
proached some of the members and
asked them where they were from. A
few of the members, including John
Ballantine, Bill McKelway and Bob
Miller, did not pass up the opportunity
to mention that they were a singing
group.

The lady then asked them if they
would come to the next taping of the
show at The Colonnades, a hotel
there. So on last Thursday, April 4,
the Sazeracs made their debut on
the program which will be ‘broadcast
over Channel 13 (ABC) in Lexing-
ton next Thursday.

The Sazeracs intend to have try-
outs for all parts on the Tuesday and
Wednesday following Springs Week-
end (April 23 and 24).

Hinkle Leads Generals
Over EM Thinclads

(Continued from page 3)

The pole vault has been expected
to be a pjroblem spot earlier in the
year, but bolstered by the return of
two vaulters from last year’s team,
things have proved otherwise. W&L
took first, second and third in the
event and it was one of the few
events in which the Generals placed
against Richmond.

While the Blue may have been
dominating the field events and short
distances, the same could hardly be
said for the long distances. Eastern
Mennonite placed first and second in
the 880, the mile, and the two-mile
runs. Eric Horst was just too much
for the Generals as he turned in fine
but exhausting performances in win-
ning the two longest events. Bob
Stack and Corbet Bryant placed third
for W&L in the mile and two mile
respectively.

Hubert H. Humphrey. W&L students
besides Faverman and Smith who at-

western regional chairman, Wise

Three resolutions by W&L passed
at the convention called for an an-
nual session of the state legislature,
a legislative office building, and repri-
mand of Byrd and Spong for their
stand on the recent Civil Rights Bill,

There were 15 college clubs in at-
tendance at the convention. Faver-
man and Smith polled an overwhelm-
ing majority of the 114 delegate
votes to win their offices. They came
into the convention unannounced with
seven votes between the two clubs.

Concerning college regulation of

Under the program, Mary Baldwin
physics majors will take several ad-
vanced physics courses here during
their sophomore, junior and senior
years. The program wil not be fully
implemented until the 1969-1970
school year, and only a limited num-
ber of Mary Baldiwn students are
expected to participate.

Efforts will be made to arrange
schedules so that the girls can travel
the 34 miles between Staunton and
Lexington with a minimum of in-
convenience.

WAL officials stressed that the pro-
gram is not a move by the Uni-
versity toward coeducational status.

The expanded theater arts courses
will be as follows: Fine Arts 122,
now Fundamentals of Theater Art
will become a two-semester course
(Fine Arts 121 and 122) in Stage
Craft; Fine Arts 124, Advanced Act-
ing and Dramatic Interpretation, will
be added to follow the present acting
and dramatic interpretation course
(Fine Arts 123); and Fine Arts 222,
currently called Directing the Play,
will be moved up to the first semester
with a new advanced directing course
to follow it in the second semester.

With the expansion of three se-
mester courses, a total of 24 hours
of Theater courses can be offered.
This concentration will be within a
Fine Arts Major with the remaining
12 hours coming from an allied field.

Invitation To View Eclipse

A total lunar eclipse will occur
occur tonight between 9:11 p.m. and
2:24 a.m., according to Dr. Howard
F. Turner of the Physics Department.

On an information sheet distribut-
ed this week Dr. Turner explained
further that little of interest to the
ordinary observer will actually occur
until the umbral phase begins, ex-
tending from 10:10 p.m. to 1:25 a.m.
Totality will last from 11:22 p.m.
to 12:12 a.m.

Dr. Turner has invited all the mem-
bers of the W&L academic com-
munity to view the eclipse from the
12-inch reflecting telescope in the
WA&L observatory on Howe Hall. A
number of small telescopes will also
be made available, and observers are
requested to bring binoculars if pos-
sible.
