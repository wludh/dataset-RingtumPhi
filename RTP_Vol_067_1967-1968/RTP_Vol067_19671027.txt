Florida Governor Claude Kirk To Keynote
Republican Mock Convention In May

Florida’s colorful Gov. Claude Kirk
Jr. will deliver the keynote speech
at W&L’s 1968 Mock Republican
National Convention next May 3.

Mock Convention Chairman Steve
Saunders announced that a tentative
schedule for the two-day event in-
cludes a luncheon in Gov. Kirk’s
honor, followed by the traditional
Convention parade from 1-2 p.m. The
parade will include floats represent-
ing each delegation, which Gov. Kirk
will review.

The governor will then deliver his
speech at the opening session of the
Convention, to be held in Doremus
Gymnasium.

His selection retains the tradition
of having nationally prominent lead-
ers kick off the Convention. Past key-
noters have included former president
Harry S. Truman, Dr. Walter Judd
(who keynoted the real GOP Con-
vention in 1960), and former vice-

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper

Not Slander

In our last issue we published an article entitled “Sopho-
more At Baylor University Dies Due To Initiation Hazing,”
containing the account of the death of a nineteen-year-old stu-
dent there following an initiation ceremony in which he was
compelled to do rigorous calisthenics after swallowing a con-
coction of laxatives and garlic.

In this week’s Tuesday Edition a letter appeared which
suggested that the article was “very misleading” and that “it
would have been better if it had never been reprinted.”

“This article could have been taken two ways that are
relevant to Washington and Lee (the letter continued). Most
people read into it a subtle reference to the “evil” fra-
ternity system at W&L. But it is equally possible to see that
fraternities are not the only organizations which conduct
hazing practices.

“This was a ‘prestigious campus ogganization’ and the
moral was that even if fraternities don’t exist, the hazing
continues. Both lines of thought lead to the moral that
extreme hazing is dangerous, and everyone would agree with
this. But most readers at W&L would come by the first line
and see a malicious cut at fraternities.”

* * =

As the writer of the letter observed, we printed the article
because we felt it was relevant to certain conditions existing
on the Washington and Lee campus. The article was not, how-
ever, a reference to the “evil” fraternity system. It was very
definitely a reference to hazing. And to argue that “fraternities
are not the only organizations which conduct hazing practices,”
and that “even if fraternities don’t exist, the hazing continues,”
is to miss the point altogether.

The fact has been and remains that brutal hazing has been
widely conducted on this campus as recently as eight months
ago. It has been conducted by organizations which claim pub-
licly that they do not conduct hazing. It has been conducted
in spite of the fact that the constitution of the council to which
those organizations all belong clearly forbids unnecessarily
harsh hazing practices. “Extreme hazing is dangerous,” says
the letter, ‘and everyone would agree with this.” But at
W&L everyone does not agree with this. And they subject
freshmen to mental humiliations and physical ordeals which
in many cases equal those which led to the death at Baylor.
The question of whether it is a fraternity or a “prestigious
campus organization” which permits the hazing is utterly un-
important; the question of whether hazing would exist without
fraternities is equally so; what is important is that extreme
hazing does exist, and that it exists at W&L.

Convention Keynote Speaker Claude Roy Kirk

 

By PATRICK AREY
Senior Staff Writer
Gov. Claude Roy Kirk, Jr., of
Florida will be the keynote speaker
of the 1968 Mock Republican Con-

vention next May 3.
The first Republican governor of
Florida since 1877, Kirk defeated

Miami Mayor Robert King High last
November in a_ conservative-liberal
party struggle for the governorship.
As governor, Kirk has been heavily
criticized for his employment of a
private security agency to fight crime
in the state and his third marriage
shortly following his inauguration.
As a
Democratic state,
strumental in’ revitalizing
GOP in a very real sense.
Following his election, Kirk in-
stalled a new, effective state Republi-
can chairman and initiated a success-

Republican governor in
Kirk has been
the

a
in-
state

ful fund-raising campaign. In state
legislature elections the following
spring, the GOP scored significant
gains.

Said Time magazine of Kirk, “He
succeeded at least in providing the
closest thing to a two-party state that
the South has today.”

Florida had supported Republican
presidential candidates in 1952, 1956,
and 1960, but failed to endorse the
Goldwater candidacy by 42,600 votes
in 1964. In that election, Kirk polled
only about 36 per cent of the vote
in his campaign against incumbant
Democratic Senator Spessard Holland,

In 1966, the upset of incumbent
Gov, Hayden Burns by Robert King
High in the Democratic primary, and
Hayden's subsequent refusal to en-
dorse High, set the stage for a Re-
publican victory in November,

Kirk’s campaign message
conservative leanings.

showed

He promised to clean up crime in
the state, to increase stale revenues
by luring in new business through
tax incentives, and said there would
be no rise in taxes. The no-tax-raise
promise was of obvious appeal to the
many retired, fixed-income residents
of the state.

Kirk’s campaign was reportedly
tainted with a sophisticated racist ap-

 

 

eae

“This space could have been better used with a story of
local news which couldn’t be taken as slander,” continued |
the letter, noting that Lambda Chi Alpha had conducted a|
symposium last week in which both VMI's General Shell and
W&L’s Dean Pusey participated, and which was not reported
in the Ring-tum Phi. (We would have been glad to run an
article on this very worthwhile symposium; however, the
Lambda Chi’s made no attempt either before or after to tell
us anything about it.) “This outstanding example of local
public service did not appear anywhere in the paper,” it con-
tinued, “but there was the story about a hazing death at a uni-
versity two thousand miles away.”

That hazing death—we did not, incidentally, publish the
details of that death; they are particularly gruesome—did, in-
deed, occur two thousand miles away. The conditions and
attitudes which caused it exist here on this campus. That is not
“slander.”’ Those who really fear for the future of fraternities
would do well to consider what would happen to them if just
one death or serious injury occurred on this campus.

We are not anti-fraternity. We are very much pro-fra-
ternity. We believe that the present fraternity system is ex-
tremely valuable to the education of the students of this uni-
versity. We deplore the kind of uninformed and fanatical
attacks which have been made upon fraternities in the past year
or so. But we also deplore the hypocrisy and brutalism which
lie behind the hazing which occurs on this campus, and we
will continue to publish articles which illustrate the effects
and elsewhere. And that is

Kirk Breaks Florida

CLAUDE R. KIRK JR,
Governor of Florida

of Maryland Democratic gubernator-
ial candidate George Mahoney (who
incidentally lost), “Your home is your
castle,” on the open housing question.

In his inauguration address, Kirk
declared his war on crime, to be di-
rected by himself, and demanded a
special session of the Florida legis-
lature within seven days to rewrite
the state constitution.

Commented one legislator, “It took
Jehovah almost seven days to make
the universe, much less prepare for
it.”

That same evening, Kirk, a divorcee
appeared at his inaugural ball with
a dark-tanned blonde at his side,
whom he introduced as Madame X.

Following the ball, Kirk went on a
five-day yacht cruise with her, and
announced their engagement on his
return. The girl was German-born
divorcee Erika Mattfeld.

In his war on crime,
the Wackenhut Corp., the nation’s
third largest security agency. This
action brought many protests of police

appointees complained of bugged

security agents.

Florida, according to the Saturday
Evening Post, hosts the single greatest
community of mobsters in the U.S.,
some 45 “celebrities” in all. This fact,
says the Post, was acccompanied by
massive corruption within the state.

Florida, lacking a statewide police
agency, is virtually powerless to meet
this problem. The Wackenhut Corp.
is directly responsible to the governor,

The Wackenhut Corp. was origi-
nally hired at the token fee of one
dollar per year, the rest of the costs
to be financed by private contribu-
tions. But contributions have not ma-
terialized, and the program has had
to ask for state assistance.

What is the value of the program?
Some say it has been used to harass
or force resignation of state employes,
but a final judgement on its effective-
ness in fighting Florida crime remains
to be seen,

dubbed

* *

During the winter, the Florida state
legislature was reapportioned. Elec-
tions in the following spring greatly
boosted Republican representation in
the state assemblies.

Although the Democrats control
both houses, the Republicans gained
enough seats to deny the Democrats
two-thirds of the vote in each house,
which is needed to override guberna-
torial veto.

Republican state senate seats in-
creased from II to 20, opposing the
Democrats’ 28. In the state house,
Republicans gained 13 seats for a total
of 39, as opposed to 91 Democratic
seats,

As to the call for state constitu-
tional revision, this effort seems to
have quietly died.

Kirk has been criticized for his
flamboyance and flair for publicity.
He flies around Florida in a Lear
jet, and his self appraisals are un-
embarrassed.

“You know,” Kirk said once,
“Bobby Kennedy, Fidel Castro, and
I are all about the same age. The
three of us, now, represent the three
alternatives of the world in the future.
And you know what? I’m the only
one of us who's for free enterprise.”

Immediately following his election,

 

speculation arose as to his possible

System

candidacy for the vice presidency.
Kirk has made no efforts to deny
the allegation.

“I’m going to be the counterpoint
to the Kennedys, the Humphreys, the
Johnsons,” he has said. “I’ve got to
live in this country of ours for the
next 40 years, and I don’t plan to
let them run it.”

More realistically, Kirk has been
assessed as the one Republican who
could offset the effects of a George

Wallace candidacy in the South in
the 1968 elections.
Born in San Bernardino, Calif.,

Kirk served in both the Second World
War and the Korean conflict. He at-
tended the University of Alabama to
study law following World War II.

Following the Korean War, Kirk
helped to form a highly successful
insurance company. He later sold out
of the insurance business and entered
investment banking.

Whatever can be said against Gov.
Kirk, it can’t be denied that he does
have a flair for publicity and a per-
sonal style of politics.

One such incident occurred this
past summer at a Jacksonville Black
Power rally.

H. Rap Brown, chairman of the
Student Non-violent Coordinating
Committee, was preparing to address
about 200 Negroes in a baseball park.

Brown suddenly found himself con-
fronted by the governor at home base.
The conversation was reported as this:

Kirk: “Welcome to Florida.”

Brown stared blankly at the gov-
ernor.

Kirk: (offering his hand) “You are
welcome here if you came here in
good faith and in spirit. We don't
want any talk about guns.”

Brown: (ignoring Kirk) “Let me
have the microphone. I didn’t ask you
to come here.”

Kirk: “Mr. Brown, we welcome
you to Florida. If you are here in

good spirits, I'm glad you are here.
Are you here in good spirits?”

Brown: “I'l] speak without the mike
then.”

Crowd: “We want Rap. We want
Rap.”

Brown: “If we can't hold the rally
here, we'll hold it somewhere else,

someone as appealing as Sidney Poit-
ier, We know what the South is like
and we also know all about Poitier.
Combine these two facile prejudices
and you have a movie that will entail
their development along predetermined
lines with a minimum of effort on the
part of the audience.

It may be that American audiences
do not want to feel or understand any-
thing that requires any effort on their
part. If this is true then there will
always be a market for movies like
“In The Heat Of The Night” in which
all the feeling and understanding is
done for us, There is nothing more
for us to do than to compare the
miscreants which the movie tells us
are the inhabitants of a small town in
Mississippi with cool, intelligent, well-
dressed Sidney Poitier to tell us with
whom our interests and good wishes
lie.

To call the movie “commercial”
and to talk about lack of taste and
intelligence is, | think, to miss the
mark, The attitude of the filmmakers
toward the all but fatally spoiled
that of the fatally misguided parent
towar dthe all but fatally spoiled
child, No one connected with the film
believes for a minute that we, the
audience, can feel or comprehend in-
telligently; any attempt to use a reality
brings forth a type of cardboard ro-
mantisism and the annihilation of any
possible reality.

Go On Sale

DID YOU KNOW—that W&L was

stamp? Only six other institutions
of higher learning have ever been so
honored, Of those six, only the Army
and Naval Academies came before
WA&L. The others are Princeton,
Columbia, Penn State and Michigan
State.

This weekend the Lee Chapel Mu-
seum begins the sale of W&L Stamp
Collections. The collections will in-
clude the W&L commemorative stamp
and four other stamps associated with
Washington and Lee, all displayed
around the University Seal. Accord-
ing to Museum officials the Collect-
ions may be bought separately or
mounted in frames. Interested persons
may see and purchase the Collections
in the Lee Chapel Gift Shop or in
the University Supply store.

required.

Pickett has become famous for
such songs as “Midnight Hour,” “Land
of a Thousand Dances,” and most re-
cently “Funky Broadway.” The Coast-
ers have gained their fame from
“Poison Ivy” and “Searchin’.” Ruffin

for “I've Passed This Way Before”
and “What Becomes of the Broken-
hearted” and Jr. Walker for “Shot-
gun” and “Road Runner.”

Tickets are on sale at the Uni-
versity Supply Store until this after-
noon, when solicitation of dance plans
for the whole year will cease. Guest
tickets can be purchased for eight
dollars per couple for each night at
the Co-op Friday and will not be
sold at the door,

defense will use a lot of different
alignments to counter the various sets
of the W&L backfield.

In preparation for this week’s game,
there has been a notable absense of
the usual pre-Openings tomfoolery at
the Wilson Field practice area. The
Generals are gunning to extend their
record to 4-2 before entering the
crucial season-closing conference
games.

Last week's victory over the Tigers
from Farmville left Washington and
Lee perched atop the standings of the
mythical Virginia Small-College Con-
ference. A victory over Bridgewater's
Eagles would give the Generals a per-
fect 3-0 slate with no Old Dominion
small colleges left to play. With the
state title (not to mention the redemp-
tion of the lately tarnished W&L
football repuation) on the line Satur-
day, both the offense and defensive
squads have prepared diligently. In
addition, the J-V squad has been
working for their first appearance as
a unit against Augusta Military Aca-
demy.

 

(Continued from page 2)
ergo, I asked no questions in the
meetings, but feel that I learned a
great deal.

I think it is unfortunate that Mr.
Feld wrote this column without look-
ing into both sides, if he did not, and
it is rather apparent to me that he
did not. It strikes me as being in poor
taste, if not poor journalism. It is the
only act or statement approaching
rancor that I perceived during those
several thoroughly enjoyable and in-
formative days in Lexington.

Sincerely,
J. H. MeMillan '42

(Columnist Feld answers, “The
column was intended as just that, a
column, and not a new analysis deal-
ing with all ‘sides’ of the questions
discussed. The purpose was to under-
line what the writer [and a number of
others who attended the conference]
felt was a major deficiency on the
part of the alumni—a lack of in-
terest in the academic and intellectual
aspects of W&L in favor of ‘such
mundane topics as Fraternities and
Conventional Dress.’

“The alumni need not have asked
‘redundant questions for rhetorical
effect’ or ‘challenged’ the faculty.
However, there are areas of the aca-
demic program [which is after all the
most important aspect of the univer-
sity} in which W&L could stand im-
provement and with which the alumni
would do well to be concerned.

“It is regrettable that the letter-
writer found ‘rancor’ in the article
and ignored its more postive aspects. =

 

sort of arrangement could be worked
out by which the EC agreed to match
whatever the Rugby Club is able to
raise on its own, with the idea that
the club would eventually be able to
pay its own way and eliminate the
grant.

The students of W&L should not
allow the Rugby Club to run the risk
of folding. if only because the club
represents the essence of athletics at
this University. When a bunch of | -
boys go oul on their own, work up
a sweat, fight to win, and enjoy the
companionship of their opponents over
a beer after the game, isn't that
what athletics is really all about?

A few bouquets are certainly due
many of the team members for their
fine showings in the games to date.
However, defensive safety Charlie
Freret certainly deserves a little extra
praise. Last season W&L’s defensive
perimeter stole twelve passes all year
long. To date, Choo Choo Charlie has
personally pilfered six, which any
math major can see is half of last
years’ total. Against H-SC Charlie
picked off three, one of which was
unbelievable at least. When the Eagles
send their receivers downfield, there
will be Charlie, looking somewhat
