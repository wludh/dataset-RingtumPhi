Law School Stages
Mock Assault Trial

Tuesday, April 30, at 1:00 p.m.,
the semi-annual mock trial will be
presented by the law school in the
Rockbridge County Court House,
Judge Holstein presiding.

This spring's case involves the al-
leged rape of Miss Priscilla Good-
body by one Miles Standish. The
prosecution’s case will be handled
by C. L. Kinder, with assistance from
Clem Ryan, both intermediate law
students, while Bill Boardman, also
of the second year class will attempt
to exculpate Standish.

As in the past law students will
serve as witnesses and the jury will
be comprised of members of the Lex-
ington citizenry. The trial is open, and
the Mock Trial Committee has em-
phasized that everyone's is invited.

The mock trial is an institution of
long standing at W&L. Its primary
purpose is to give aspiring lawyers
an opportunity to ply their prospective
trades under simulated trial condi-
tions. The trial is exclusively the

Jay Passavant, receiving over 51
per cent of the vote in Thursday’s
election, was declared the student body
president-elect over Herb Crenshaw.

Passavant’s vote total was 521 com-
pared to Crenshaw’s 445, Of the
1011 votes cast, 45 were write-ins.
In the general election held Monday,
Passavant led but was unable to claim
an absolute majority of the 953 votes
cast, There were 33 write-ins, mostly
for Jeff Wexler, the candidate who was

eliminated in the primary election
last Thursday, April 18.

Early Thursday morning a letter
was circulated endorsing Crenshaw
and signed by five members of the
student body Executive Committee, of
which Crenshaw is one of the two
members from the junior class this
year. Crenshaw, a member of ODK,
the president of Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity and a Dean’s List student,
was the president of the sophomore

 

class in 1966-67. His campaign, and
the letter supporting him, was based
on his experience in dealing with the
Honor System.

A letter signed by Mike Hosford
answered the charges of the Cren-
shaw supporters by saying that the
present EC was just trying to per-
petuate itself and that experience on
this year’s EC was of “limited im-
portance, since not one piece of
major legislation was passed.” He

In Election Rematch With Crenshaw

that the present Director of Financial
Aid for W&L, William A. Noell, was
elected with no previous experience.

This runoff race is the first in re-
cent history and may be the first in
the history of the school. Until 1965
the candidates were selected by party
caucuses and there were rarely more
than two for any major race, thus
eliminating the situation which kept
Passavant or Crenshaw from compil-
ing the necessary majority required
by the constitution in the Monday
election. The EC then ruled that
whoever won a plurality in Trus-

day’s election would be declared the
winner.

Arid Discussions

Anyone who has seriously followed the electioneering of
the past week must have come to the conclusion by now that
politicking at W&L is properly the art of the splendid cliche.
Every candidate, whether he really understands what he’s say-
ing or not, always has plenty to say about “getting W&L mov-
ing again,” “lack of communication,” “conservatism,” etc.,
etc. We may, if we wish, blame the politicos for it all; but then,
blaming the politicos has become as much a cliche as the rest,
and in the end we would only be blaming them for picking up
the cliches that have become standard in what passes for con-
cerned thought at W&L.

So many ideas, so many discoveries that were intensely
meaningful when they were first formulated have been worn
down by endless repetition to the point where they have be-
come automatic responses to given problems. Once reduced
to this stage, far gone from the intentions and meanings which
their creators originally had for them, they become part of a
pool of dogma available to every political platform and bull
session—a pool from which they seldom re-emerge into mean-
ing.

The marvel of the cliche is that it can fix absolute values so
simply. That The Fraternity System Is Good or that The Fra-
ternity System Is Bad are judgments made every day in the co-
op with equal conviction and equal disregard of whether it is in
fact good or bad or a little of both or neither, or of what
exactly is bad and good to whom and for whom. But it’s so
much simpler to use the cliche. The moment you say it you
are in immediate communication with anyone who hears you
and who recognizes your cliche as belonging to the public pool.
And if he returns another cliche, whether he agrees with you
or not, both of you feel in safe and well-known territory. You
may even get into quite a heated argument, and never have to
abandon whatever group of cliches constitutes your philosophy.
In a pinch, you can even prove your point with a student body
poll—a poll at W&L being the sum total of persons who check
a box for one neatly-typed cliche as against the number of
those checking another one. A more arid and misleading dis-
cussion can hardly be imagined; and yet, the majority of the
discussions on this campus about the character and future of
W&L are conducted in exactly this way.

Very few issues escape the murder we commit on them.
Perhaps discussion of the war has been freer here than other
discussions (at least, most of the cliches started out in Wash-
ington, not here) but the war was a great deal more personal
to us than any campus issue is likely to be. Last year, briefly
and for a few individuals, discussion of the fraternity system
may have reached a meaningful level, but the ideas presented
then have for the most part been drained of any significance,
and are now no more than the cliches of one “concerned” mi-
nority among many. For the rest, we hear only cliche after
cliche: Professor X is trivial, Professor Y is a great man, maxi-
mum student power is good, limited student power is bad, con-
servatism is bad, liberalism is good, the Troub Theatre is
inadequate, the library is inadequate, the University is inade-
quate—that is the sort of thing with which we so often set out
to “get W&L moving again.” Professor X may really be trivial,
the theater may really be inadequate, but who bothers to look
beneath the cliche long enough to make a fair evaluation of
Professor X? Who but a Troub really knows what he’s talking
about when he repeats that the theatre is inadequate?

We could pass all this off if it at least did not do active
harm, but when it is demanded of student and administration
leaders that they act in accord with the supposed wishes of
the student body, then the cliches are elevated to the status
of policies. The uproar over ending Saturday classes is typical.

There are plenty of people around campus to complain
that there is no discussion of vital topics among the student
body as a whole, But who can blame serious students for
rejecting discussion about subjects which they may instinctively
feel to be nonsense, given the context of hack phrases in which
such subjects are argued. So often—too often—discussion
gets us nowhere; cliches by their very nature are sterile, ex-
cept to breed more cliches. Gentlemen, we don’t need more
discussion. We need more thoughtful discussion.

THE RING-TUM PHI

e

By LESLIE SMITH

Open Letter to the Ring-tum Phi:

Whither goes Washington and Lee?
In light of its recent history, the
official response of this university to
the tragic slaying of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. was most gratifying. The
quiet memorial service in Lee Chapel,
attended by those who came to ex-
press their goodwill, was in part a
recognition that they shared a com-
mon humanity with this man of peace.
Martyred in Memphis, his eloquent
voice, which was raised so many times
in the cause of social justice, is now
silent. But what of those principles
for which he lived? What is the role
of universities like W&L in the lessen-
ing of racial tensions and the pro-
moting of social justice? Can_ this
university become a model of the
kind of society men of goodwill hope
to build? We have made a significant
beginning at Washington and Lee,
but our integration is token and the
sincerity of our commitment is there-
fore open to question. Part of the
tragedy of Memphis was the failure
of white America to understand the
depth of our problems and to deal
effectively with them. It was a failure
even to recognize them in their true
light. It was a failure that will be
repeated so long as there is a re-
fusal to recognize the legitimacy of
Negro aspirations.

Yet, the winds of change have be-
gun to blow here. Under President
Cole, W&L broke with “tradition”
and instituted a policy of “open” ad-
missions. Mr. Huntley, our new and

‘. .. winds of change have begun to blow here.”

Can W&L Help Halt Racial Tension?

energetic president, for whom this
writer has much respect and admira-
tion, shows great promise in the
clarity of his perception as to what
WAL is now and can become in the
future. Under his leadership there is
hope of our becoming a truly na-
tional center of learning rather than
a center of Southern provincialism.
We face now a new test of commit-
ment. A more diversified student body
is greatly needed. The present student
body is too homogeneous, its values
unchallenged and unenriched by con-
tact with the unfamiliar. Next year,
the level of integration at W&L is
expected to go up. Yet there seems
to be little awareness, especially on
the part of student leaders, of the
difficulties that remain to be over-
come. The question is one of how
we can assure all students that they
will find an open community of
scholars and gentlemen, that their
success here will be limited only by
their own capabilities, and that there
will be full participation in the life of
this university. And what of the fra-
ternity system and the great obstacle
that it will present in achieving this
goal? This is only one of the diffi-
culties, there are others just as dis-
turbing. The commitment of the ad-
ministration alone is not enough to
achieve success here. There is a need
for strong courageous student leader-
ship. The present EC has failed to
provide that leadership. Messrs, Nash,
Faulk and Kline et al have main-
tained an unbroken silence on the
question of further integration here.

 

The composition and attitude of the

 

By PLEAS GEYER

“Why are you going to Atlanta?”
Many times I heard the question.
And I couldn't answer. Why indeed?
What could my additional presence
accomplish there among so many?
Surely nothing. Did I go to mourn?
Yes, of course! But what has geo-
graphy to do with mourning? Why
go to Atlanta? I couldn't answer .. .
yet I had to go. The questions galled
me and I had to go.

I am standing amid a mass of
other people, all preparing to march
in mourning for the incomprehensible
slaughter of a peaceful man—perhaps
as wholesome a man as our race will
ever know. I am standing here. I
look at the others. They eye me
back. I look down and shift my
weight. I feel uneasy. They are at
a distance. WHY? All of us here
for a common purpose but still
fragmented. WHY? And with that
question came jeering back all the
the others, all running into this one.
WHY? An anger rose within me.
WHY? A self-directed anger. WHY?

And then there was an answer.
Somewhere within me, within us,
there was a seed, bred in my case
by southern grandparents and north-
ern suburban environment, that de-

sired a distance, that shrank from

communion, that felt different. It was
not hatred, not even distrust, only
their seed. Beneath reason, beyond
sensibility, it lay, robbing us all of
spontaneous identity, forcing our in-
sulted selves to squint furtively out
of eye-corners. This was what I had
come to be shown—that this seed was
in me also. This was the urgency that
had dragged me here—that I was
not only a mourner of death, but
a participant in the forces that gen-
erated the death I grieved for.

“Let's march, man.” It was a tall
young Negro behind me. He grinned.
“Come on, baby. Join hands and let's
go.” I smiled back as my anger eased,
I held out my hands on either side,
and people took them, firmly. Then
we walked and with every step my
anger eased. With every step I felt
an irrepressible calm replacing the
urgency that was gradually seeping
away. I seemed to be walking away
from that seed and its constraint. And
we sang.

“Deep in my heart... 1 do
believe . . . that we shall overcome
someday.”

This too I came to be shown. That
a man can root out this seed, the
dregs of his being, with every step,
cast it behind him with every step,
and walk away from it .. . with

new EC is not yet known, but they
would serve their university well, if
they are able to see beyond the glass
menagerie view of this university that
seems so prevalent here. For history
will sit in judgment as to whether we
meet our responsibilities as a uni-
versity toward the achievement of
better race relations, both on this
campus and the world beyond Red
Square. We can no longer retreat
behind a wall of silence. Neither can
we sit on “the hill” unmoved by the
turbulence of modern society.

As a first step, this writer proposes
to the new elected leaders: (1) That
they endorse and support a vigorous
recruitment program to the end that
diversity may be achieved here; (2)
That they endorse and promote a
policy of “fair employment” in regard
to administrative, secretarial as well
as faculty appointments; (3) That they

promote review of the salary scale of
non-academic employees; (4) That
they undertake a study of how this
university can best allocate its human
and economic resources to the eradica-
tion of black and white poverty in
Rockbridge County. This is at best
only a partial listing of what Wash-
ington and Lee can do if its commit-
ment is to be more than an ex-
ercise in tokenism. As students, we
have a unique responsibility to show
that W&L’s commitment is genuine.
We can provide part of the answer
to where we are going. If this uni-
versity demonstrates a generosity of
spirit, we open the way to creative
dialogue in confronting our problems,
and we show forth the best of our
heritage from the past and the best
of our hopes for the future.

Letter to the Editor...

Dear Sir:

In light of the recently publicized
moves of the University of Virginia's
Human Relations Council to end all
forms of segregation at that Uni-
versity, W&L has once again been
shown to be both backward and
somewhat hypocritical in its own
policies. We have token integration—
and only that. In other fields of con-
cern we still use segregated facilities
and are apparently making no attempt
to remedy this. To this end, | would
suggest several changes which should
be made publicly in official univer-
sity policy and then carried out.

1) To actively work toward en-
couraging young men of not only
the Negro race but of other races
as well to attend Washington and
Lee, and to also seek new professors
and instructors from all races. This
would be intended not only to help
the disadvantaged but to provide the
university with more of a balanced
student body and faculty. Not only
scholarships but a change in admis-
sions policies and a tutorial program
might be established to accomplish
this.

2) To refuse university co-opera-

3) To allow academic credit to be
given for participation in a human
relations and human problems course
which would involve not only class-
room work, but also, if possible, work
with the local poverty programs, In-
terest encouraged in this area by the
university would be as valuable or
more valuable than credit given cur-
rently for participation in R.O.T.C.
There will be no need to protect our-
selves from foreign invasions if we
are so fragmented as to be destroyed
internally.

policies or whose national policies
allow segregation to exist in the
local chapter.

This week-end is alumni week-end
and also will be the time for a spring
meeting of the Board of Trustees. If
WAL is to climb out of the educa-
tional and cultural hole that it has
gradually been digging itself into and
to once again become a totally en-
riching and valuable educational ex-
perience we must take steps now.
There is usually very little communi-
cation between the students and the
Board of Trustees, but perhaps that
too could begin here. The requests
are not unreasonable and in fact
only mirror the request of the class
of 1967—that W&L not allow itself
to become a small, obscure South-
ern College.

Yours truly,
s/Joseph E. Bates

 

 

To the editor:

The acquisition by McCormick Li-
brary of a painting from Cordelia
Riegel’s recent art show here is praise-
worthy. Its location in the library
is not.

Surely a significant work by a
rising contemporary artist deserves a
more prominent place than a corner
behind the door of the second floor
browsing room, a place frequented
by few students and no visitors. This
is more difficult to understand when
Miss Riegel's proximity to the Wash-
ington and Lee community is consid-
ered. She deserves more thoughtful
attention.

By REED BYRUM

Nelson A. Rockefeller, Governor
of New York and a possible presi-
dential aspirant, has been an inactive
candidate for the presidency for over
a month. Recently, the Rockefeller
Campaign Committee of WAL has
reactivated its dormant forces; Pat
Arey, Hal Clarke, and Jon Adams

rising senior from Chatham, Virginia,
has consented to explain their actions
and their background reasoning, as
well as to enlighten upon many of
the controversies of Rochefeller's
candidacy,

Ring-tum Phi: The most pertinent
question concerning your Commit-
tee ix, of course, why have you
decided to restart your campaign
activities?

Arey: The principal reason for this
action is to protect the interests of
Nelson Rockefeller, who is still very
much of a potential candidate for
the presidency. He, as Ronald Reagan,
represents a serious challenge to Rich-
ard Nixon, who has put together only
a very fragile fabric, which can be
torn easily

Secondly, Rockefeller still has
shown a definite interest in the na-
tienal convention. This is well evi-
denced by his reservation concerning
his acceptance of a draft and his

best to give Rockefeller as much
notice and publicity as possible.

We have contacted several promi-
nent national figures within the past
few months, but they were not at
all helpful. Even George Hinman, who
is the Republican National Commit-
teeman of New York and a top ad-
visor for Rocky, said that he was
proud of our efforts, bul was unable
to aid us.

We will not anticipate any miracles
because of our lack of funds. We
will just have to run a low-key
campaign until the Mock Conven-
tion,

R4P: Have you planned any pre-
convention social activities?

Arey: We have scheduled a beer party
for Monday, April 29, at the New
York Delegation Headquarters at
4:00 p.m; this location is right next
to Leggett'’s. Of course, if we had
more money, we could have more

at least 200 to 250 delegates, plus a

 

number of straglers, to go charging
around the convention hall, beating
drums, ringing cow bells, and raising
hell. This will be typical of most
of the other candidates.

RP: Supposing that Rockefeller
loses the presidential nomination,
do you think that Rocky will try
to win the nomination for the vice-
presidency?

Meet To Bridgewater

The Washington and Lee track
team seemed to have an aversion to
first place finishes Tuesday, as they
dropped a 93-52 decision to Bridge-
water College. Despite some fine per-
formances and many close finishes,
the Generals found themselves unable
to carry off their share of events.

As usual, the biggest bright spot
of the meet for W&L was Mike
Neer, who once again carried off the
honors in the high jump. Neer came
within a quarter of an inch of break-

Blue with a throw of 133142”. This
proved to be the only event the
cindermen could sweep as Earl Ed-
wards and Greg Crampton took sec-
ond and third places respectively.

John Lawrence placed first in the
pole vault with a mark of 11°6”.
Cris Crossman managed a second to
give the Generals their only other one-
two combination. Other events won
were the shotput by Phil Jones and the
broad jump by Bill Kahn.

Although the Generals placed well
in the field events, they were totally
ineffective in the running ones. The
Blue failed to take a single first in
this area, Corbet Bryant, team cap-
tain, was most notable here in run-
ning the two-mile in 10:14.6. This
was his best performance of the year
and ordinarily should have been good
enough to win, yet it was three sec-
onds behind the winning time, and
only amounted to a third.

The loss to the Eagles brought the

| thinclads’ season record to 2-3. To-

morrow, the Generals face Old
Dominion on Wilson Field in what
should prove to be the most interest-
ing match-up of the year. The Mon-
archs boast a fine team and the
leading high junyper in the state. Mike
Neer of W&L has to be rated number
two and a victory over OD’s Wright
would give him a big boost toward
taking All-State honors, Neer has

as well as last Saturday's 6-4 double |
overtime loss to Towson State.

The Blue’s record to date is 1-4, |
but this is not indicative of their

Towson and Notre Dame were very
close. In fact, the Generals’ offensive
unit outshot both teams, their main
problem being in hitting the goalie
and not the goal. Despite this, at-
tackman Tom Pittman has managed
to score ten goals for the team lead.
Chip Chew, also an attackman, is
the next leading scorer, with eight
tallies to his credit. Whit Morril is
leading all mid-field scorers with two
goals. Captain Charlie Stewart has the
most ground balls, having picked up

and goalie Dave Johnson, are pre-|

The Washington College team, per-
haps one of the best in the country,
plays such squads as John Hopkins, |
Maryland, and Syracuse. They've been
Strohbar League champs every year
since the league has been in existence,
and are known for their excellent stick

Despite W&L’s _ less-than-exciting
record, the team still has good morale,
but a big win could do wonders for |
their performance in the remaining
games. The last two games against

Ken Cribb
Named Head
Of YR Club

Kenneth Cribb, a Phi Delt sopho-
more, was elected president of the
Washington and Lee Young Republi-
cans at the annual meeting of the
club Wednesday night.

Cribb, a native of Spartanburg,
S.C., was elected by acclamation,

Hank Graddy, Beta junior, from
Versailles, Ky., was elected first vice
chairman and Robert R. Weed, sopho-
more from Richmond, was elected
second vice chairman,

Other new officers are Sky Lininger,
a freshman from Tucson, Arizona,
recording secretary; Al Gibson, Sigma
Chi sophomore from Rockford, Ill.,
corresponding secretary; and Wally
Barre, Phi Delt sophomore from
Spartanburg, S.C., treasurer. Both
Lininger and Gibson were opposed.

The W&L YR’s also passed unani-
mously a resolution calling for affilia-
tion of W&L with the Virginia As-
sociation of Student Governments.
The resolution criticized the lack of
participation in statewide activities by
WAL.

A second resolution endorsed a
capital improvement bond issue for
$81 million which will be presented
to the voters of Virginia in a referen-
dum this November. The bond issue
will provide funds for school and
mental health facility construction.
Young Republicans from Mary
Baldiwn College attended the club
elections. Following the meeting, a
“happy hour” was held at the “Liquid
Lunch.”

Programs to finish the school year
were discussed following the meeting.
Republican congressional candidate
“Pete” Giesen of Staunton has been
invited to speak to the club in May.
A picnic at Goshen with the Mary
Baldwin YR’s following the Mock

R| Convention here was also suggested.
