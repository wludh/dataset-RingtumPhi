PRANSITION:

Contact Symposium Starts Feb. 7;
Senator Morton Is Featured Speaker

Contact 1968 — entitled “What's
New, Pachydrem?” — begins tomor-
row afternoon to examine the present
status of the Republican Party and
to analyze its prospects for the future.

The symposium will consist of a
series of seminars, speeches and panel
discussions. The panel discussions,
which will follow directly every
speech, will include questions from
the audience.

The kickoff for the fourth Contact
will be at 4 p.m. Wednesday, when
a seminar with Senator Thurston
Morton, Republican from Kentucky,
will take place.

At 8 p.m. that evening, Sen. Morton
will give a speech in Lee Chapel on
the rights and duties of the opposi-
tion party in Congress, One question
expected during the evening session
will be the extent to which a national
party's stance on various public ques-
tions is hammered out in Congress.

Senator Morton's recently announc-
ed “dovish” position on Viet Nam and
whether this announcement has pro-
moted an intraparty rift is certain
to discussed. Sen. Morton was once
the Republican National Chairman
and the chairman of the Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee, as
well as permanent chairman of the
1964 Republican National Conven-
tion. He is in a position to discuss
the consequences of a ranking mem-
ber of a party taking a well-publicized
divergence from the party line on a
major issue,

Thursday will bring to the Wash-
ington and Lee campus one of the
Republican Party's most colorful
urban leaders, Gov. Theodore Mc-
Keldin, and a scholar-party worker
who is one of the most knowledgeable
persons in the United States today
on the Republican Party, Stephen
Hess. Starting the day's program will

be a seminar at 2 p.m. with former
governor and former mayor Me-
Keldin of Baltimore, Md. A true Re-
publican since his birth (the R. is for
Roosevelt), McKeldin is known for
his witty approach to politics and his
biting criticism of all that displeases
him.

He was the first Republican to cap-
ture the statehouse of Maryland from
the Democrats in many, many years,
and he had the honor to place Presi-
dent Eisenhower in nomination in
1952 and to second the nomination
of Nelson Rockefeller in 1964. Mc-
Keldin, however, did not feel that
party unity or his dedication to Re-
publicanism were sufficient reasons to

support Senator Goldwater in the
1964 election.
Gov. McKeldin will also address

himself to the Republican dilemma
in the cities at 8:00 that evening.

At 4 p.m. an address by Mr. Stephen
Hess, a fellow at the John F. Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard
University, will be given. Mr. Hess
was the co-author of “The Republican
Establishment: The Present and
Future of the G.O.P.”
in preparing this encyclopedic pub-

 

i
His research |

lication has given him deep insight
into the inner workings of the Re-
publican Party.

Mr. Hess’s speech will center on
the G.O.P. and up-date the conclu-
sions drawn by him in “The Republi-
can Establishment.” In doing so, he
will probably spend some time on the
Rockefeller phenomenon and also at-
tempt to answer some of the criticism
leveled at the book by such persons
as Robert D. Novak. Mr. Hess’s other
books include “Hats in the Ring” (co-
authored by Malcolm Moos) and
“America’s Political Dynasties.”

Barry M. Goldwater, the titular
head of the Republican Party, will be
Contact’s guest Friday. Mr. Gold-
water will talk about the role of the
conservative in the Republican Party
in his speech in Evans Dining Hall
at 8 p.m.

A seminar with Goldwater will take
place Friday in duPont Auditorium
at 3 p.m. Unlike the other seminars,
participation in the Goldwater semi-
nar will be by invitation only. How-
ever, the seminar will be open to the
public and all those who wish to
listen will be welcome.

Saturday promises to be one of
the more interesting days of the

symposium. With Professor Samuel
Lubell of Columbia University’s
Graduate School of Journalism and
nationally syndicated political colum-
nist Robert D. Novak as its guests,
Contact will enjoy a direct dialogue
between its speakers.

Professor Lubell, who will speak at
4 p.m., will discuss the failure of both
political parties to meet the challenge
of the domestic revolution in America
today. An authority on polling and
the author of many books, “The Fu-
ture of American Politics,” “White
& Black: The Test of a Nation,”
“Revolt of the Moderates” and “When
People Speak” (a monologue) to
name a few, Lubell promises to be
one of the more controversial speak-
ers of the Contact week. Mr. Novak
is tentatively scheduled to be on the
Lubell panel following the speech.

At 2 p.m. on Saturday, Mr. Novak
will participate in a seminar and at
8 p.m. he will discuss the Republican
Party.

Novak, too, has made a contribu
tion to contemporary political lit
erature. He wrote “The Agony of the
G.O.P.” and he was the co-author of

“Lyndon B. Johnson: The Exercise
of Power.”
Professor Lubell will be on the

Novak panel, and will assure a con-
tinuation of the give-and-take of

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspapet

The time has come,
the walrus said

 

... to talk of many things. Such as, the basketball team. A
decade and a half ago, when subsidized athletics so spectacularly
took leave of Washington and Lee, so did (as the Friday
Edition mentioned earlier this year, in another context) a good
deal of our alumni spirit. And that meant much, much more
than just fewer visitors to the west end of campus: because
when you come right down to it, for good or not, big-time
athletics are undoubtedly the single-most important vehicle for
focussing widespread attention on a college or university. Only
a very few schools have popularly known names which are not
owed in substantial part to athletic prowess. Even one or two
Ivy-League universities—not too many people can tell you
much about them except that (1) they exist, (2) they are “in”
the Ivy League and therefore are entitled to a certain quantity
of ascribed “prestige,” and (3) they have “really good’”’
basketball and football teams. It is difficult to say what else—
that is, what academically—makes them specifically good edu-
cational institutions. Without quality (3), qualities (1) and
(2) might do little for a school.

W&L’s basketball team is ‘
a magnificent job in making people all over sit up and take
notice of Washington and Lee. The University cannot help
but benefit when people ask, “All right, “Washington and
Lee’: What is it?”’, because the answers are all good and all
impressive.

That, in itself, is a significant accomplishment. The less
haughty accomplishment of the team is more familiar to every-
body within the University community—resurrecting the pre-
sumed-dead enthusiasm here for something aside from Hollins,
Macon, Sweet Briar, Big Weekends and maintaining the ABC
store. On this matter we can say little that everybody hasn't
already said with pleasure, so we won't. But we agree with every
word of it.

A couple of matters are brought to mind, though, to the
discussion of which we must succumb, For example, the buzzer
for times-out to which attendees at home games are subjected.
It makes stouthearted men crumble, and we suspect it even
shakes the backboards as it shakes the rafters. And the peren-
nial problem of fire hazard in Doremus—for some reason (we
hope there’s a reason) known only to God and somebody
over in the gym, people are locked in the world’s largest poten-
tial casket. If the gym ever catches fire, they might as well just
push it and all the bodies inside it over into the ravine and
cover it up, because nobody would escape.

We want to talk, sometime soon, about the quality of the |

refereeing and the lack of it on some occasions, and the need
(now even more obvious) for a new gym as well as for a new
theatre. For the time being, though, the Tuesday Edition
offers its further encouragement and enthusiastic thanks to

Washington and Lee’s Generals—who, in spite of countless |

problems and inhibitions imposed upon them from the ex-

ternal, have developed under Coach Canfield’s fantastic sup- |

ervision into a really great, not-so-small team, that can drag
even the likes of us to watch them do some very good things
on behalf of Washington and Lee.

Stephen Hess

The latest book by Stephen Hess
has received a great deal of praise
from all shades of political opinion,
Hess, who will speak in Lee Chapel
at 4 p.m. Thursday, co-authored with
David Broder “The Republican Estab-
lishment: The Present and Future of
the G.O.P.” Reviewers from National
Review to the New York Times have
called the book the most up-to-date
definitive study of the Republican
Party.

National Review indicated it was
pleased to be considered a major
part of the conservative wing of the

party by the book and concluded
that “For every politic, amateur or
pro, this book can be an excellent

primer for election year 1968,”

In a recent New York Times Book
Review Section, Patrick Anderson
cited the thoroughness with which
Hess and Broder examined the Re-
publican Party. “Now and _ then,
in their SO0-state survey
of the party's standing, the authors
more than he
may want to know about the Re-
publican grass roots, but that is a

There has also been criticism
the book, notably from columnist
Robert Novak who will speak for
Contact on Friday. Hess in his speech
Thursday is expected to “update and
extend” the ideas presented in the
book and Novak is certain to com-
ment on this.

Divided into three parts, “The Re-
s Establishment” examines

first the party on the national level,
its political spectrum, its national fi-
nancial supporters, and its profes-
sional leadership.

Theodore McKeldin

 

What do you think the Republican
Party can do for the city on a
nation-wide scale? Where would you
start first? How?

These questions and many others
will be attempted to be answered on
Thursday night at 8:00 in Lee Chapel
by former mayor of Baltimore and
former governor of Maryland, Theo-
dore R. McKeldin. He was elected
mayor of the City of Baltimore in
May, 1963, for a term ending in
December, 1967. He had previously
served for two terms as governor of
Maryland from 1951 to 1959, Prior
to that he had served as mayor of
Baltimore from 1943 to 1947,

During his recent term as mayor
of Baltimore, Mr. McKeldin has in-
augurated or brought to fruition a
large number of new programs to
improve physical and social conditions
in the city.

Civil Rights Advocate

Many new programs were begun to
improve living and working conditions
for the people of Baltimore. Mayor
McKeldin sponsored before the city
council a comprehensive civil rights
bill prohibiting discrimination in em-
ployment, public accommodations,
housing, education, and health and
welfare services.

This omnibus bill was enacted ex-
for the housing section. The

term and has begun many programs
to alleviate the causes of poverty in
Baltimore. In an effort to improve
housing conditions, the Mayor has
expanded the City’s conservation pro-
gram while at the same time engaging

Contact Promises A Lively Discussion
Thursday

Saturday

Samuel Lubell

Samuel Lubell, noted newspaper-
man and foreign correspondent, has
this to say about Barry Goldwater in
his book, “The Future of American
Politics”:

“Goldwater was campaigning for
‘a choice, not an echo,’ assaulting the
whole New Deal at every front. Usu-
ally there was something he was
against that most people wanted to
save.”

“In Butler County, lowa, to cite
just one example, a farmer climbed
down off his tractor, thought for a
few moments and said, ‘I'm a Re-
publican but I'll probably go the other
way. I'm afraid Goldwater will do
what he says and get rid of the whole
farm program,’

 

“ee

Mind you, I
this farmer continued. ‘We'd all

gotten out of farming at the end of
World War HI. But I have three kids

think he’s right.)
be |

to put through college. Maybe I'm
letting Goldwater down, but it would |

hurt to much to do what he pro-
posed.” ”
It is what Lubell termed “this

sense of ‘the all or nothing.” which
cost Goldwater the election. He traces
the political scene back to its be-
ginnings with this explanation.
Election of 1928

“In many ways, Smith's defeat in
1928. rather than Roosevelt's 1932
victory, marked off the arena in
which today’s politics are being
fought. The Happy Warrior and four-
time governor of New York first
hacked out the rural-city cleavage
which generates so much of the force
behind the present struggle between
Congress and the President. It was
Smith who first slashed through the
traditional alignments that had held
so firmly since the Civil War, clear-
ing the way for the more compre-
hensive realignment which came later.

A “fundamental difference between
the Republican and Democratic par-
ties is that they have been the ve-
hicles for the political advancement
of quite different ethnic elements. The

 

Republicans, by political necessity,
became sensitive to the aspirations of
the “old” immigrant elements, who
settled so largely on the farms. The
Democrats, in turn, have been
alive io the aspirations of the “new
immigrant elements who crowded the
teeming cities.”

Industrial Revolt

“In the industrial centers
volt of the city shifted the

the
balance of

re

political power from employers to
labor, from the descendants of the
“old” Americans to the offspring of

the former minority groups. To sur
vive politically, the Eastern Republi
cans have had

Robert Novak

Robert D. Novak, Saturday eve-
ning speaker, presents a rare blend
of insight and knowledgeability, From
the American heartland—lllinois—he
attended the University of Illinois be-
fore taking a job as reporter for the
Joliet Herald News upon his gradua-
tion.

Novak thus presents a striking con-
trast to Contact's other two political
analysts. Stephen Hess is an east
coast native, while Samuel Lubell was
born in Poland before immigrating to
New York as a boy.

Novak, then, comes from the Re-
publican stronghold of the Middle
West, a major part of the party base.
Many believe this grass roots support
is drying up and Novak will consider
the problem of its shrinkage and pros-
pects for its expansion.

Capitol Hill Correspondent

Novak served in Korea as an army
lieutenant and returned to join the
Associated Press staff in Omaha. He
made rapid prgression up the AP
ladder. From Omaha he went to Lin-
coln, Nebraska, then to Indianapolis,
and finally to Washington, D.C, in
1957 as Capitol Hill correspondent.

In 1958 Mr. Novak joined the Wall
Street Journal staff and in three years
became chief congressional reporter
for the Journal.

Novak and Rowland Evans joined
forces on “Inside Report,” a political
column published five time weekly and
syndicated in 160 newspapers by the
Chicago Sun Times.

Time calls the column, which is car-
ried by the Washington Post a “strik-
ing success.” the fact of which “can
be traced to its emphasis on reporting
rather than punditry.

Novak, in his capacity as columnist,
has traveled to Europe, Asia, and

Latin America to test grass roots senti-

movemenis. Most recently he has visit-

munist countries
Criticized Hess

Recently, Novak criticized “The Re-

another Contact speaker, Stephen
Hess. in talk here Feb. 8

this criticism. We may have the be

Comeback Story Of The Year

When Mr. Canfield took over the
job of Head Basketball Coach in 1964
there wasn’t a great deal of talent to
work with. Recuriting was unknown
and a coach had to field the best
team he could from whatever showed
up on the first day of practice. Coach
Canfield had some luck though; he
found a pair of freshmen who led
him to believe that things weren't
quite as bad as he had anticipated.
Those freshmen were Larry Perreault
and Jody Kline.

Both Larry and Jody saw consid-
erable action on that year’s varsity
but unfortunately the team posted a
dismal 2-17 record. Then second
semester Perreault encountered aca-
demic difficulties and was forced to
seek another school where his basket-
ball talents could exhibit themselves.
The following year Jody found him-
self with a starting assignment at
guard, That was the same year that
things took a turn for the better.
The team went on to post a 10-15
record as Jody, along with freshmen
John Carrere, Rob Bauer, and Earl
Edwards, brought a spark of life into
the previous dull occurence of W&L

| basketball games. The student body

sensed that something was in the mak-

| ing and it was. The prospects for the

|
|
|

 

following year were indeed favorable.

When school resumed in the fall
of 1966 a great many changes had
occurred in the shape of the W&L

team. Coach Canfield had recruited
some of the finiest freshmen in
the area (make that about a 200
mile radius), The Generals had height
to spare with 6’5” Mal Wesselink,
65” Mel Cartwright and returning
letterman 6’5” Earl Edwards. Unfor-
tunately there was a gloomy side to

 

the picture—All-Staters Rob Bauer
and Frank Morrison encountered in-
juries that allowed them to see only
limited action and Jody Kline came
onto the court about 15 pounds over-
weight.

Because of his extra weight Jody
lost a good deal of his speed and also
lost his job to Tommy Cox who came
on to be one of the finest defensive
| players W & L has even seen. Jody
/saw only occasional action as the
Generals rolled up a 20-5 record and

 

 

 

 

Player of

Mal Wesselink is one of
the more consistent players
on the basketball team.
Every game he turns in a
fine performance and _ his
play is one of the big fac-
tors in the Generals’ success
this season. Mal may always
be counted on for double
figure scoring and his de-
fense is always up to par.
Mal is currently averaging
12.6 points per game and
6.7 rebounds. Also, he is
shooting close to 50%, from
the floor and averaging 1.5
assists per game.

Mel’s play in the week
before exams was outstand-
ing and deserving of being

breezed to the CAC championship.

After that season, Jody had every
reason to quit the team. It looked as
though he would be replaced perma-
nently and few people remembered
the fine performances of his fresh-
man and sophomore years, But Jody
didn’t quit; he was elected co-captain
and proceded to lose that extra weight.

When practice began this fall there
was a great deal of talk as to who
would start as guard along with John
Carrere. When the Generals came on
the floor against Bridgewater on
December 1, it was Jody Kline and
it’s been Jody ever since. After one
off-year Jody has come back to play
good, steady, heads-up basketball. On
defense he’s aggressive and keeps up
the pressure. On _ offense Jody
handles the ball well, keeps a cool
head and throws the type of pass that
has made him the team leader in
assists. Though he seldom takes a
shot, when he does it is almost a
certain two points. Jody also comes
down with more than his share of re-
bounds.

When most players would have quit,
Jody stuck it out and it has payed off
for both him and basketball at Wash-
ington and Lee. Jody has shown the
drive and determination that is char-
acteristic of the real athlete and has
shown the spirit, leadership, and un-
selfishness that it characteristic of the
true team player. Surely the come-
back player of the year is Jody Kline.

 

Swimmers Resume

This Week

 

Coach Stearns’s swimmers are work-

ing hard to win the remaining meets |

of the season. The Generals face Old
Dominion this Friday at Old Do-
minion.

The natators then return to Lex-
ington to face two tough opponents.
On February 16, Loyola challenges
the Generals, Loyola squeaked by
with a narrow victory last year, and
the swimmers hope to even the score
this year. On February 20, they face
West Virginia University in the last
meet of the year.

On February 23 the Generals travel
to St. Louis to participate in the CAC
tournament which ends the swimming
season.

Loop Course training program.

THE LOOP COURSE trains selected col-
lege graduates with management potential for
careers with Bethlehem Steel. The Course begins
in early July and consists of three phases:
(1) orientation at our headquarters in Bethlehem,
Pa.; (2) specialized training in the activity or
field for which the Looper was selected; and
(3) on-the-job training which prepares him for
more important responsibilities.

OPPORTUNITIES are available for men in-
terested in steel plant operations, sales, research,
mining, accounting, finance, and other activities.

DEGREES required are mechanical, metal-
lurgical, electrical, chemical, industrial, civil,
mining, and other engineering specialties; also
chemistry, physics, mathematics, business ad-
ministration, and liberal arts.

If you expect to be graduated before July, 1968,
and would like to discuss your career interests
with a Bethlehem representative, see your
placement officer to arrange for an interview
appointment—and be sure to pick up a copy of
our booklet “Careers with Bethlehem Steel and
the Loop Course.”’ Further information can be
