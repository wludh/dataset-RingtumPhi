Senator Strom Thurmond
Talks On U. S. Challenge

Sen. Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina will visit Washington and
Lee Thursday, February 29. After a
banquet sponsored by the South Caro-
lina delegation to the Mock Conven-
tion, the senator will speak at 7 p.m.
in Lee Chapel. Sen. Thurmond’s
appearance is being sponsored by the
Young Republicans.

The title of the Senator’s speech
will be “Challenges to Freedom.”

Dinner Planned

the South Carolina delegation
dinner for Sen. Thurmond will be at
the Robert E. Lee Hotel at 5:30.
Over 200 tickets have already been
sold,

Sen. Thurmond will arrive at the
Roanoke airport about 2 p.m. After
his arrival in Lexington, a cocktail
party will be given for the Senator
at the PiIKA house.

Sen. Thurmond is a member of the
Republican party, although for many
years he was affiliated with the Demo-
cratic party. In 1964 the senator re-
nounced his Democratic membership
and became a member of the G.O.P.
in order to support Goldwater as the
Republican presidential candidate. In
the Democratic landslinde that fol-
lowed, Sen. Thurmond was never-the-
less overwhelmingly re-elected to the
Senate by South Carolina.

In 1948 Sen. Thurmond was the
States Rights Democratic candidate
for president. He carried four states
and received 39 electoral votes. The
senator has the distinction of de-
livering the longest speech in the
history of the U. S. Senate.

IFC Takes

Preliminary Vote

On Revoking Pledge Reform

Amid parliamentary confusion, the
IFC last night divided this year’s
new pledging rules into two parts
to defeat one and sustain the other.
Ralph Pearcy, Sigma Chi, reported on
the success of the Heart Fund drive
in Lexington, for which the IFC
canvassed the city. Steve Saunders,
SPE, spoke to the group about the
importance of a sober student body
during the upcoming Mock Conven-
tion,

Junior Justice Roddy Roediger,
Sigma Nu, made a motion last week
that the new pledging rules (those
adopted in May, 1967) be abandoned
for next year’s rush. Those rules now
State that there may be no required
pledge activities until after mid-
semester, and that any pledge with
less than a 1.5 at that time becomes
inactive. An inactive pledge who fails
to make a 1.5 at the semester is
depledged; any other pledge who
makes less than a 1.5 is then in-
active. Any inactive or depledged
pledge may become active once more
upon making a 1.5 at any subsequent
grading period,

Pledging Anytime

Roediger introduced a substitute
motion this week, which called only
for the repeal of the section of the
rule which does not allow pledging
activities before mid-semester. His
motion was carried in near-unanimity,
which means that fraternities may
have pledging activities at any time

Mr. Taylor's in literature |
has been long and varied, beginning
soon after World War Il. In 1948, he
published his first work, a collection

thereafter, in 1950, his second book

the motion passes again next week.
A second motion was then intro-

rules having to do with grades, in-
active pledges and depledging. The
motion received only ten votes, less

than the two-thirds necessary, so it
was not carried.
The IFC will meet next Monday

night, at which time the motion to
abolish the no-pledging rule must be
passed for the second time before it
is carried and the constitution is

Heart Drive: “Success”

According to Lexington Heart Fund
Chairman Ralph Pearcy, the drive last
Sunday was a complete success, A
total of $809 was collected, an in-
crease of over 20 per cent from last

year.
: ne
Each fraternity was assigned a

 

specific neighborhood in Lexington
which it was to canvass for donations
to the Heart Fund. More money may
be coming in later, as cards were left
ai the doors of those families who
were not at home.

Saunders outlined the Mock Con-
vention agenda to note several times
at which meal hours would be dif-
ferent. The agenda will be published

later, but Saunders had two im-
portant points to make:

Attendance during the Saturday
morning session will be treated as
class attendance, since Saturday

classes have been called off by faculty
action. Of course, those who want
to cut may, but a cut will be recorded
for each of the student’s regularly
scheduled Saturday classes.

EC Debates Possible Split
Of Executive, Honor Roles

After enacting a measure of

fi-| of politics and more respected by the

nancial support for the Law Review | students as @ consequence, it was
last night, the EC turned to less press- argued.

ing matter in a consideration of the
advisability of splitting the EC into
separate legislative and judicial roles.

Gil Faulk proposed that 30 cents
per student of the student body head
tax be allocated to the Law Review.
The 30 cents would be merely a
re-allocation of the funds already
available in the Student Body Re-
Fund; the amount that each

The proposal passed unanimously.

EC Split
The discussion of splitting the EC
from a report given by Lee
Halford on a similar program dis-
cussed last year. The main reason for
the study was the difficulty that the
EC faced in allocating its time when
trials precluded legislative
activily

The proposed constitution would
change only the role of the EC as
the Honor System, which
would be administered by an elected
group of judges.

In the discussion of the measure,
the arguments in favor were that the
splitting of roles would separate the
powers and possibly make the en-
forcement of the Honor System more
effective. The separation would make
the Honor Sysiem more independent

regards

 

The opening of more positions for
those running for office might stimu-
late others to run who might not at
present.

The arguments against the measure
were that no significant need has
been demonstrated and that a split
would tend to minimize the import-
ance of both sections. The argument
about allowing more students to run
for the office was disallowed because
of a shortage of candidates for even
the present offices in the last election.

WEL Battles To Conference Championship

If someone had asked Verne Can
field last week what he felt his
Washington and Lee  basketballers|
must do to win thei con
secutive CAC championship, he might
have said “play tight defense,” or “get
the ball in to the big men,” but if
he had said that the tournament was
going to be won from the foul line,
most people would have thought he
was expecting his Generals to be the
victims of an upset, since WAL has

The championship; the referees

The Generals won a set of enormously impressive victories
since we last mentioned them in these columns (one week
ago today). The CAC bell was not got effortlessly. The con-
ference championship is all the more satisfying because nobody
can rationalize away our number-one status this year, unlike
last year when we won “only” because of the home-court ad-
vantage and/or a quirk (so they said). This weekend, we had
everything going against us that we had going for us last year.
But you can’t keep a good team down. To repeat an outrageous
but somehow-applicable tritism, “‘class tells.”

The Emory and Henry game a week ago tonight was a
magnificent exhibition of real team talent—a very, very good
closeout for the year’s home program. We said a few weeks
ago that we wanted to speak of the quality of the refereeing
at certain Generals’ home games—and then as now, we had in
mind Messrs. Swink and Bushkar (the two who tried to referee
in the E&H-W&L game). All season long, in every game
refereed by either or both of them, they dragged official re-
sponsibility in the gutter. But last Tuesday’s game was truly
more amazingly and patently misrefereed than probably any
other game in this state all year. Their blatant abdication of
professional integrity was notoriously, embarassingly obvious
last Tuesday. But—here is the beautiful part of it—they
couldn’t faze the Generals. Not a damn’s worth (and last
Tuesday, Swink’s and Bushkar’s refereeing wasn’t worth even
that). They couldn’t dent the Generals’ victory. When Swink
so misrefereed the RPI game—which we nevertheless won—
early in the season, we held off mentioning it only because we
were afraid of petty vindictiveness towards the team. We should
have hit him then, anyway—he couldn’t have become more
petty, nor more unfair, no matter what we said, than he and
Bushkar were last week; and even then the Generals proved
they could overcome it with room to spare anyhow.

Incidentally, we hope that none of what we say about the
basketball Generals is looked upon as taking credit away from
the swimming Generals, who also brought back a bell; nor
from the wrestling Generals, who also brought home a chunk
of the bacon; nor from the rifling Generals, who returned from
their tournament this weekend with one of the best records in
a long while.

The year’s first worthwhile proposal

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi endorses with enthusiasm Mr.
Roediger’s proposal—now before the Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil—that the group of senseless pledging restrictions passed
last year (for one purpose, which they utterly failed to serve)
be done away with.

Salt-in-our-open-wounds department

It’s depressing enough to find the Ring-tum Phi receiving an
almost-unlimited number of stupid, pointless publicity re-
leases — dozens of them, all the time — from just about
every agency and bureau in the entire federal government
(every last one of them, incidentally, sent under one frank or
another—i.e., at the public expense). The Peace Corps leads
them all: they seem to have three address plates for this one
newspaper, so we receive triplicates of every piece of trash
they crank out, the total being several score of inane releases
every week.

This weekend, though, the federal government's propa-
gandizing hit an all-time low, even for it; insult was com-
pounded by injury. Not only did we receive the usual number
of transcripts of Jack Vaughan’s many speeches to high

. '
schools and community colleges all across the country, but—

right on the heels of the LBJ/Hershey no-more-graduate-
school edict—we received a request that the Ring-tum Phi
promise to give free publicity to Secretary Wirtz’s latest cru-
sade, which is entitled “Continue Your Education.”

WLUR, the W&L FM radio sta-
tion, celebrates its first anniversary
today.

By RICHARD WATT

In only one year, WLUR has de-
veloped on all fronts into a progressive
and open-ended outlet of University
life. Broadcasting from 7 to 11 p.m.
Sunday through Friday, the station
serves up a variety of programming
that is of interest to the entire Lex-
ington community.

The station has developed as a
learning experience, a kind of labora-
tory, for the students involved who
are separated into three departments:
news, music and engineering.

Don Husat, the head of news, has
been instrumental in expanding the
“Home Edition” report to 35 minutes,
with a special “Insight” report and
weekly editorials. With several addi-
tions to the staff, the station has
been able to expand the sign-on re-
port at 7 and add a five-minute sign-
off news spot at 11. Journalism ma-
jors cooperate with the station to
provide the stories for the local news
section of “Home Edition,” an unique |

service of the station.

piled by W&L students, was a 9:30
p.m. feature of Lexington’s WREL
long before the University station was
even in the works. “Home Edition” is
now aired simultaneously over WLUR
and WREL. “Home Edition” itself is
a complete report of the day's events.
First are ten minutes of local news,
followed at 9:40 by news of interna-
tional importance. The last ten
minutes of the report are devoted to
a survey of the business and sports
news in the country and around the
world, The “Insight” report, recently
added to the program, is a five-minute
in-depth look at a major news story
of the day.
Programming Variety

Don Ellis, head of music on the
station, is as flexible in the variety
of his programming as the size and
proclivities of his staff will permit.
Since music is the main constituent
of the station's programming (usually
three of the four hours), the whole
gamut of musical genres has been
run, from classical and chamber
music to jazz and Broadway hits. With
the addition of Sunday evening air
time, the station has been able to
indulge in more profound studies of

such a deserved reaction in the mod-

 

ern history of the Washington and
Lee Concert Guild.

The world of music has been for
the past few years witnessing a major |
revival of interest in the styles of the |
Renaissance and Baroque periods. It
follows naturally that the recorder
and the harpsichord would be major |
focal points of the renewed interest.

Heinrich Issaac’s compositions be- |
gan the program. As Martha Bixler
explained to those present, these short!
pieces were written by almost all
composers of the period, and were
usually variations on the popular
melodies of the time, This Isaac group
was performed entirely on recorders
—Miss Bixler on alto, Leber on
tenor, and Newman moving from bass
to great bass as required. The quality
of the performance was unimpeach-
able,

Jacobean Fantasias

Four Jacobean Fantasias formed the
second group, While not as interesting
as the songs of the first group, these
fantasias represent perhaps the epi-
tome of the last 16th and early 17th
century style, As such, they were al
the very least of no little intellectual
interest.

Ending the first part of the pro-
gram was Johann Rosenmuller’s Trio
Sonata in G Minor for 2 recorders
and continuo, Leber noted that the
Flauto Dolce had seen fit to rewrite
this one a bit, making it a trio for
four recorders and continuo. They
were entirely successful in this ar-
rangement, with Miss Bixler and Mr
Newman switching madly between
movements, and in mid-movement,
from tenor to soprano back to tenor,
to soprano again, only to repeat the
cycle once more, finishing in a flourish

Scartatti Harpsichord

 

The second half of the program
began with four Scarlatti harpsichord

nately, bring along its own harps
chord, and the one which was im
ported for this concert did not effectiv

by the week-night features.

The technical end of the station is
run by Sandy Zimmerman. The engi-
neers, who are all licensed by the
FCC, are obliged not only to control
the nightly operation of the station,
but also engineer such specials as
away basketball and football games
(10 of which have been aired), and
rebroadcasts of the Contact speeches.
By taping the Nixon speech this Janu-
ary, and the Contact speeches of
Morton and Goldwater, the engineer-
ing crew were able to help several
radio stations (including the CBS net-
work) in their news coverage of the
events here.

The radio station is growing as
student and community interest grows.
Charles Winston, advisor to the sta-
tion, reflects the feelings of the student
participants, emphasizing that “the
station is a professional endeavor in
the community interest, but remains
a useful tool of the students’ imagina-
tion and ingenuity.”

With a staff of 55 which is con-
tinually growing, the station looks
forward to greater accomplishment
and diversity of service to the Lex-

 

ington area.

 

Saturday Class
Question Put To
Vote Monday

By LARRY HONIG

A referendum will be taken next
Monday, March 4, on the subject
of Saturday classes. There will be
three ballot boxes, one in front of
Washington Hall, one in front of the
Co-op, and one in the freshman quad.
All students and all faculty members
are invited to vote, from 8:15 until
3:00.

Last week's Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
carried an article which outlined a
plan to abandon Saturday classes. The
plan, devised by a faculty member,
consists of:

@ One-hour classes, five each day on
Monday through Friday, which begin
at 8 and end at 1:20 (there is a 5-
minute break between each class);

@ No afternoon classes, except for
labs and seminars as is presently the
case;

@ Five meetings of each class in every
two-week period (MWF the first week,
TTh the next week, then MWF, and
so On).

Briefly, the basic advantage to stu-
dents and faculty consists of having
a longer weekend for whatever pur-
pose the individual sees fit, including
facilitated dating, studying and relax-
ng

he disadvantages are a longer
school morning, longer classes (by
ten minutes), possible course discon-
tinuity when a particular class meets
every other week on two days only,
and what a member of the faculty
termed “abuse” of the longer week-
end by the students.

The ballot to be used in next Mon-

 

Ballot boxes will be open on Mon-
day from 8:15 to 3, at Washington
Hall, the Co-op, and the Quad.

 

day’s referendum will ask “Do you
favor the continuation of the present
schedule, with Saturday classes?”
There will follow a choice for those
who vote “No.”

The choice is either the plan out-
lined in this and last week's article,
or any plan to eliminate Saturday
classes, with the probability of after-
noon classes and the possibility of
90-minute periods. There will be space
for comments.

Everyone is urged to vote in the
referendum, even if he is not in
favor of abolishing Saturday classes.
If such a proposal is to be submitted
to the faculty as suggestion, partici-
pation must be high.

the Miami Convention later this year

The committee itself is composed
of eleven members, five of whom
serve as executives and six as sub
committee chairmen, The vice-chair
man is Christopher Chandor, Secre

The Platform Committee will hold
subcommittee hearings in the latter
part of March. At this time each of
the six areas will be discussed, and
various witnesses will endeavor to
outline what the policies of the Re-

C.A.C. Bell Falls To Stearns’ Swimmers

W&L’'s swimming team led by Billy
Ball, Bill Brumback, and Dave Kymp-
ton marched to a solid victory in the
CAC championship. Both Ball and
Brumback were co-winners of the
Outstanding Swimmer award.

The final score was Washington and
Lee 164, Sewanee, the defending

 

Bill Brumback

champion, 118, and Washington Uni-
versity 116. Both of the Blue’s co-
captains Pat Costello and Noel Clin-
ard finished their swimming activities
by setting new conference records.
Friday afternoon saw the natators

capture a first, second, third, and
sixth in the 400 yard individual med-
ley which gave the Generals a 24—
12 (Sewanee)—8 (WU) point lead that
never vanished. They also won all
three of the relays and 9 of the 14
individual events to completely domi-
nate the event as the Generals were
able to capture at least a second in
every event,

Among the Generals who netted
firsts were Bill Brumback in the 100
yard frestyle, the 200 yard freestyle
and the 50 yard freestyle while
participating in two of the winning
relays. Ball won the 100 yard and
the 200 yard backstroke as well as
the 400 yard medley event, Ball, too,
participated in two winning relays.

Freshman Hal Catlin captured a
first in the 200 yard individual medley
and was in two of the winning relays.
Pat Costello handily won the 200
breastroke and was barely touched
out in the 100 yard breaststroke, Noel
Clinard staged a comeback recovering
from fourth place after 8 dives to win
a tightly fought diving contest of 11
dives. Freshman Mike Carrere falter-
ed in the final round of the diving
and captured a 4th place. A scant 20
points separated Carrere in fourth
from winner Clinard who won with
a point accumulation of 303.40 which
set a new conference record.

The three relay teams pulled off a
stunning triumph. All three of them
set new school records, two of them
set new CAC conference records, and
all three qualified to participate in the

 

 

 

Coaches Canfield and Stearns:

national college division champion-
ships.

The 400 yard freestyle relay team
of Forman, Kympton, Catlin, and
Brumback barely won due to the
typical high speed clutch performance
of Bill Brumback. The 800 yard free-

 

Weekend Victors

style relay won handily as it set a
new conference record. Forman, Ball,
Catlin, and Brumback captured this
event for the Generals. In the 400
medley relay, the last event of the
meet, again the Generals easily won

of the night, as Mal Wesselink and

until the buzzer sounded.

The Generals opened second-half

the side to make the score 34-32,
After a series of basket exchanges, the
Blue were finally able to open up
some semblance of a lead, as John
Carrere’s jump shot at 15:10 in the
half gave them a five-point spread,
42-37.

Southwestern, though, fought back
with a scrappy defense that forced
three straight W&L turnovers, and

went ahead 44-42 at 10:41 on a pair
of free throws by Ken Brooks. Then

regain the advantage at 49-44, the
last two points coming on Wesselink’s
nifty turn-around underneath.
Following a Sewanee time-out at

Player Of

Last Tuesday night a
truly great basketball player
was awarded the Ring-tum
Phi’s first annual “Player of
the Year” plaque. M E L
CARTWRIGHT continu-
ally demonstrated the de-
sire, ability and attitude that
is so characteristic of great
athletes. Mel was a team
leader in every department.

Mel’s career at W&L is
half over now, and the Ring-
tum Phi staff sincerely hopes
that the next two years will
prove just as rewarding for
the basketball program. We
eagerly await next year’s sea-
son, when once again the
fine players of Washing-
ton and Lee’s basketball
team will take to the hard-
woods of Doremus Gym-
nasium: when once again
Mel Cartwright will delight
the crowd with his fine dis-
play of skills.

terfly), Costello (breaststroke), and
Forman (freestyle).

Besides capturing 12 firsts, the big
Blue rolled up 6 seconds, 1 third, 4
fourths, 4 fifths, and 5 sixth place
finishes. They established 12 new
school records for a 25 yard pool
and 7 new conference records, The
new conference records went to the
800 freestyle relay, the 400 yard
medley relay team (3:54.5), Ball in
the 100 yard backstroke (58.6) and
the 200 yard backstroke (2:11.9), Pat
Costello set records in the 100 yard
breaststroke (1:07.9 which was broken
later in the meet) and in the 200
yard breaststroke (2:27.5). The final
conference record was set by Noel
Clinard in the diving.

Second place winners for the Gen-
erals were Dave Kympton who cap-
tured seconds in the 500 freestyle, the
1650 yard freestyle, and the 100 yard
butterfly besides helping two relays
on to victory. Costello got a second
in the 100 breaststroke, and Scot Mc-
Elroy was able to net a second in the
200 yard butterfly and a third in the
400 yard individual medley. Bill
Kimmel rounded out the Generals’
scoring with a second in the 400 yard
individual medley.

The Generals came into the CAC
with the momentum of five straight
victories under their belt with a stun-
ning upset victory over West Virginia
University to spark their charge. The
only General defeats this year went
to Catholic University and American

This concludes Coach Stearns’ second

Weekend Proves Fruitful

By RIC BERARD

This past weekend all of us had
cause to celebrate as Washington and
Lee completely dominated the three
C.A.C, tournaments, With both a first
basketball and swimming and a
second in wrestling, WAL swept the
conference's winter sports and set the
Stage for our winning the overall
trophy in May

Although we would like to thank
each athlete for his significant constri
bution to life at WAL this year, there

today's recounting of those wonderful |

not enough

moments will give each man a sense
of the gratitude that we all feel

There is room enough, though, to

say a special word of thanks to four

While everyone aware of the

coaches have persisted and achieved
a great deal. And, even if the school
is still unable to provide them and

our entire community with satisfac
tory accommodations, our pride in
them and their work could be no

they have not only helped those stu

ely measure up to the demands
of the artist. In short, the physical
limitations o fthe instrument prohibit-
ed a complete exhibition of the per-
former's superb talent.

Scarlatti’s sonatas were followed by
the more interesting, and surprisingly
modern in its casual dissonance,
Sonata Ill (3) in F Major for bassoon
and continuo, of Johann Ernst Gal-
liard. Once more the harpsichord was
employed as a continuo.

Pieces of the 1960's

The final section of the program
scheduled three recorder pieces of the
1960's, The first, Miller's “Song for
Recorder,” was lyrical enough, but
seemed to have no reason or plan be-
hind it. It was mot strictly speaking
avant-garde, nor was it odd, but
neither did it capture much feeling,
despite the superb artistry of Miss
Bixler, The second of the truly mod-
ern works, clearly an experimental
design, was Linde’s Fantasien und
Scherzi for solo alto recorder. This
was avant-garde, and it was odd.

The final piece was Woollen’s
Sonatina for recorder trio. Woollen
did not stretch the powers of the
recorder; instead he wrote his piece
to conform enjoyably to the best
attributes of the instrument.

The concert was more than enjoy-
able, more than entertaining, more
than instructive. It was an experience.

Novelist Peter Taylor

(Continued from page 1)

two other works by Mr. Taylor
“Happy Families Are All Alike’ and
“Miss Leonora When Last Seen, were
published in 1959 and 1963, re-
spectively. A playwright as well as
an author of novels and short stories,
Mr. Taylor wrote “Tennessee Day in|
St. Louis” in 1957.

During his career, Mr. Taylor has
gained a great deal of recognition for
his work. He received a Guggenheim
award in 1950; this was followed, in
1952, by a grant in literature from
the National Institute of Arts and
Letters. In 1955, Mr. Taylor was
awarded a Fulbright fellowship to
France. The Ford Foundation honored
him with a fellowship grant in 1960.

Mr. Taylor's activities have not been
confined to the U.Va, campus. A
1940 graduate of Kenyon College,
he served in the Army after his
graduation, Before going to Virginia,
Mr. Taylor taught at Kenyon € ollege,
his alma mater, as well as at North
Carolina, Indiana, Ohio State, Chi-
cago and Harvard.

Brown Physics Prof.
To Lecture

(Continued from page 1)
Arrangements for Prof. Masons
visit are being made by Prof. Edward
F. Turner Jr, chairman of W&L's
Department of Physics. Prof. Mason
is expected to give public lectures,
meet informally with students and
staff members, and consult on curri-
culum and research problems in
physics.

Mason was born in Atlantic City,
N. J. He received his B. S. degree
from Virginia Polytechnic Institute in
1947 and his Ph.D. degree from the
Massaschusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy in 1951.

Prof. Mason received the Scientific
Achievement Award of the Washing-
ton Academy of Sciences for 1962 in
the physical sciences, “for his many
outstanding contributions to the mole-
cular theory of gas properties.” i

Convention. He said that drinking on
campus and in the gym, of course,
is not allowed. But the biggest prob-
lem at previous conventions was
drinking in the city of Lexington.

Saunders has made a proposal to
the faculty that either there be al-
lowed more than nine combo parties
or that that number be open, to avoid
the situation where half or more of
the students feel they must get drunk.

Concerning the sincerity with which
the city and the faculty urge a de-
gree of sobriety—especially during
the parade—Saunders said that “all
anyone has to do is gross somebody

out at the parade and the Mock |

Convention will conclude its 60-year
history in 1968.”

NFU, PDT, and PKS begin the
bowling finals tonight. It looks like
Law has won handball, beating out
PKS, KS and PiP. Now down to
business.

Wednesday night PDT and SAE
met in the first game of the basket-
ball finals. PDT won, 40 to 32, after
a strong SAE finish. The high point
of the game came when Atkins of
SAE stuffed Johnson of PDT. Louie
P. could not believe it, so he blew the
whitle. It was the only thing SAE
could cherish from the game. PDT’s
zone clogged up the middle and
Hart’s accuracy from outside desert-
ed. Lee led SAE with 12 points and
Murphy led PDT with 9,

The next game was possibly the
| best basketball game to watch that
| has been played at W&L this year.

 

 

Intramural Wrap-Up

Cunningham converted eight of 13
free throws to lead PKS to a come-
from-behind, overtime victory over a
rattled NFU five. PKS won 59-56,
but Freret was high man with 23
points.

Thursday night put the winners and
losers against each other. PDT blew
PKS off the court by the score of
41-25. PDT’s Crampton pulled down
21 rebounds, just four short of PKS
total. He added 12 points to his effort
to lead all scorers for the night. The
sad PKS story was little rebounding
and a cold shooting night for Arm-
strong who had hit consistently the
night before to sink the NFU hopes.

NFU shocked a disorganized SAE
team in the second game 57-31. NFU
controlled the boards, outrebounding
SAE 34 to 18. Baker led all scores
with 16 for NFU while Lorman con-

 

trolled the boards with ten NFU
defensive rebounds. NFU won with
a pressing man-to-man defense and a
ragged, but effective fast break.
Bulletin

PDT takes title by defeating NFU
49 to 30. PKS came in second on a
52 to 42 score.
