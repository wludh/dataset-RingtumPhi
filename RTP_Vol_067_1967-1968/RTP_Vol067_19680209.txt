factors: 1) the broad background of
diverse interests and talents offered
by their candidates; and 2) that today
most people will vote for candidates

Hess stated that “Nixon is a four-
to-one bet to win the nomination,
based on his winning the first three
primaries”—those in New Hampshire,
Wisconsin and Nebraska

Rockefeller and Reagon, in that
order, were listed as the next most
promising candidates. Hess also saw
Percy and Romney as possible, but
not likely, choices.

1968 Republican Political Prospects
Is Subject Of CONTACT Program

Morton
By PAT AREY

The 1968 Republican convention
will be “a much more open conven-
tion,” Sen. Thurston Morton told
WAL students Wednesday.

Sen. Morton, the opening speaker
of the 1968 CONTACT program,
spoke at a seminar in the Law School
during the afternoon and in Lee
Chapel Wednesday evening.

Because of the proliferation of
favorite son candidates, Morton said
that the GOP convention, to be held
in Miami this August, would approach
conventions such as the ones in 1948
and 1952.

But, Morton predicted, if Richard
Nixon wins big in the primaries, and
if “he gets a lot of this loser image
off his back,” he will be front runner
for the nomination at the GOP con
vention,

Morton said that he was tired of
losing elections, and he would look

Symposium Week .

The nine days between Feb. 7 and 15 this year ought to.
have been called Symposium Week. Not only have we been
treated to the annual IFC-sponsored CONTACT Symposium,
but beginning on Tuesday of next week the Glasgow Endow-
ment Committee will present a three-day literary symposium
on “Approaches to Shakespeare.” All of this, naturally enough, |
set us to thinking on the subject of symposiums, or more
particularly, symposiums at W&L.

This year’s CONTACT program was, as always, beautifully
planned and executed; the eminence and variety of the speakers
if anything even surpasses CONTACT’s performances in the |
past. But it is to the Glasgow Committee that W&L owes
special thanks this year for restoring some balance to the
aims and subjects of what has been called “the symposium
experience,”

CONTACT was conceived in 1964 with the avowed pur-|
pose of offering “varying viewpoints and approaches to an
overall intellectual problem.” It has certainly achieved that
aim in the four years since then. CONTACT is undoubtedly |
one of the best intellectual symposiums around—alas. Since |
1965, when it took a socio-economic-political look at “The |
American Experience”; through 1966, when it took a socio- |
economic-political view of “The City”; and into 1967, when
it took a socio-economic-political view of“The Crumbling |
Establishment,’ CONTACT has exhibited a depressing socio- |
economic-political sameness as to topic. Now, in 1968, if it |
is true that we have succeeded in dispensing with the sociology
and sociological economics, we still have the politics with |
“What’s New, Pachyderm?”

Now, we have absolutely no objection to any of these fields’
of knowledge. The topics which have been covered by
CONTACT are such that they cannot help but be of pressing |
interest to any thinking student—for that matter, to any think-
ing American. Certainly the discussion of such subjects is a
valid function of an intellectual symposium. It is not, however,
the only function.

It has been argued that these topics appeal to a larger
percentage of the student body than do other topics, and
(adds the cynic) that attendance is bad even then. This is a
distortion of the intellectual aims which CONTACT professes |
to further. We are not dealing here with a quantitative matter.
CONTACT is not a Broadway play. Success is not measured by
the size of the crowd. This would seem to be an obvious point.
It is so far from being so that during last year’s fraternity-
administration tussle the low attendance of CONTACT could
actually be used as proof that students in general are anti-
intellectual. This is preposterous. There are a very large num- |
ber of persons at this school—serious students, with serious |
intellectual commitments—-who do not go to CONTACT
simply because they do not want to hear another four days of
sociology, sociological economics, and politics. Yet at a school
which calls itself a liberal arts institution, they run the risk of
being called anti-intellectual.

That is why our special admiration and gratitude goes to
the Glasgow Endowment Committee—for having the courage
and good sense to recognize that Shakespeare can be as im-
portant, as exciting, and as crucial to our times as “What's
New, Pachyderm?”; and for undertaking a three-day seminar
with the full realization that it will not attract a crowd as large

as CONTACT’s,

The Glasgow Committee has made the first step in the
right direction. We hope, in fact, that it will be possible for
them to maintain a yearly seminar of this nature in the future,
either in place of or as a supplement to the writer-in-residence
program which the Committee has traditionally sponsored.

Unfortunately, we cannot look to the Glasgow Committee
for much more than such initial encouragement as it is giving
by holding the Shakespeare symposium. By the terms of the
Glasgow Endowment, the Committee is limited to sponsoring
programs which encourage literary ends. It is therefore up to
CONTACT to remedy its own shortcomings and present a
really varied series of topics in the coming years. Why not a
symposium on modern music for 1969? Some of the major
modern composers, folk singers, blue singes, ete., would be no
more difficult to obtain than Mr. Goldwater. Or perhaps a look
at modern art? Or at modern theater (led by Richard Schech-
ner, who attracted so much attention here in October). Or
history. Or philosophy. Or modern poetry, Or mathematics
Or any of the sciences.

None of this should be construed as an attack on the
admirable concept and institution that CONTACT is. But
perhaps a new look is needed at CONTACT’s original purpose:
“to offer varying viewpoints and approaches to an overall
intellectual problem.” That problem is not to be found only
in sociology and politics, but in any field of knowledge where
there are men doing new and important things. That field
and those men belong at CONTACT,

The Pros and Cons of Gold

Melnyk: Pro

By W. WILLIAM MELNYK

Kenneth Paul Shorey, the distin-
guished Canadian liberal with whom
I am sure our leftist colleagues on
campus are aquainted, has commented
that “we are observing the nascence
and growth of what bids fair to
become as astonishingly popular indi-
genous American sport called giggling
at Barry Goldwater,”

To paraphrase California’s Gover-
nor Ronald Reagan, the trouble with
our liberal friends is not that they

much that isn't so. For if the liberal
establishment believes it won a de-
cisive victory in 1964, it is sadly mis-
taken.

They beat Barry Goldwater four
years ago, but the fact so often over-
is that the Goldwater cam-
paign created a grass roots movement

virtually assure a Republican victory
this November. A new Republican
Party emerged from the defeat in
1964. A party with direction, pur-
pose, and support. And it was Barry
Goldwater, with the aid of his vi-
triolic leftist antagonists, who was
primarily responsible for that re-
juvenation.

 

Best Fund Raiser

It is well known that Goldwater |
has been the best fund-raiser the party |
has ever had, and in 1964 his cam- |
paign received hundreds of thousands |
of contributions in five dollar amounts |
and under. For the first time, the
Republican Party was able to obtain
considerable grass roots financial sup-
pour in, five an dten dollars at a!
pour in, five and ten dollar sat a
time, in response to the Goldwater
philosophy and the Goldwater image. |

 

As a will

their

the Republicans

result,
enter the “68 campaign with
biggest war chest in history. And the
money will have come from what has
been traditionally considered Demo-

crat territory: John

American,

Q. Average

But more important than money,
Goldwater has been responsible for
a tremendous increase in manpower.
All those members of Youth for
Goldwater, Citizens for Goldwater-

| Miller, and the dozens of other ad

hoc organizations, did not, dear lib-
erals, disappear into the woodwork
on 4 November 1964. They joined
the ranks of the Republican Party to
continue their crusade, and here is
where grass roots support for the
Gop is most impressive. Gone are
the days of non-ideological Republi-
can “Me Too-ism.” These new sup-
porters are young, enthusiastic, and
above all dedicated to the belief that
Barry Goldwater was right,

| Letters To The Editor .. .

 

To the Editor:

In commenting upon the recent

ard Nixon, it would seem that he
treated the campus to a preview of
the new Nixon campaign style. Re-
laxed and well poised, he delighted
his audience with his references to
“Doc's,” “going down the road,” and
the nationally publicized mock con-
vention. Other comments, however,
in a speech billed as “nonpolitical”
opened the door to controversy. Mr.
Nixon deplored the peace movement
in the United States and attempted to
place the blame for the continuing
war upon the dissenters, If there were
only unity, he exclaims, then, we
could quickly clean this thing up|
and keep the communists in North |
Vietnam. Somehow that sounds like
a familiar refrain that has been
sounded somewhere else before.

In discussing the role of the United
States in the world today, Mr. Nixon
brushed aside the nation’s misgivings |
about the war. In his view, our mis-
sion is to save the world from com-
munism. The problem with this view
is that it can not be achieved by
placing the United States in the role
of world policeman endowed with
sweeping powers to maintain order
throughout the universe. Those who
ascribe to this view talk about “the
responsibilities of power,” but in Sen, |
Fulbright’s view, it should more ap-
propriately be called “the arrogance |
of power.” It presents a flatiering self- |

 

portrait, but one totally out of tune |
with the realities of the twentieth
centry. If the United States once
possessed such power, it was the
product of a time we can not now
recall. The determination of people to
chart their own destiny, which is ex-|
pressed in rising nationalism, and the |
emergence of nuclear power in the |
other world, are realities that Ameri-
can foreign policy can no longer |
ignore, even if Mr. Nixon chooses |
to do so |

In addition, the conflict in Vietnam
can not be reduced to the simple
formula of the United States vs.

World Communism. This conveniently |

in | 00, Va., is an old school (founded in
the struggle, the unpopular and un- |

ignores the nationalistic element
democratic government in Saigon, the |
destruction of the Vietnamese coun

tryside, and the displacement of
thousands of refugees. Mr. Nixon in

sists that the debate here is on sec

ondary issues, but it is deeper than
that. 1 goes to the nature of the
threat and the means employed to
deal with that threat, This is what

the dissent is all about, Our actions
abroad can not be reconciled with
our traditional values. The dissenters
are telling us that we must create
a role for ourselves that is compatible
with our traditional values. If we are
fighting to preserve democratic insti
tutions, then, we had better inform
some of our allies who are operating
without much regard for the freedom

| hard

 

America says we are defending in
the world. It is a sad spectacle. From
Latin America where the military is
in charge, to Africa where suppos-
edly civilian regimes are as totalitarian
as their military counterparts, to
Greece, the cradle of democracy,
where the colonels rule unchallenged,
the reality of the U.S. dilemma is
made plain.

How can we police the world when
events abroad are beyond our con-
trol, and even more importantly when

| our own cities are unsafe and slum

infested? Our primary responsibility
is to keep this nation strong, and not
to embark on grand adventures
abroad. The world has little need
for a new imperial power, but there
is a great need for moral leadership.
Secretary McNamara has said that
“The decisive factor for a powerful

| nation, already armed, is the character

of its relationship with the world.”
Our mission is not to impose our
will by force, but to lead the free
world by example at home and com-
promises abroad. Mr. Nixon showed
no real awareness of the difficult
and painful problems involved. The
best that can be said about his per-
formance is that it was a new Nixon
with superb stagecraft, but singing
the same old song of unadulterated
line anti-communism, spiced
with euphemisms and patriotic ex-

| hortations,
Sincerely,
Leslie Smith, Ir
Law ‘69.
Dear Sir
An excerpt from an article by

staff writer Richard Corrigan on the
editorial page of the Washingion Post
reads: “The students, young men who
were too young for the first grade
when Nixon became Vice-President of
their country, received him with loud
applause, Only one hostile question,
from an anti-war student up in the
balcony, was uttered during his hour
long appearance, and that was met
with hisses and frowns and rollings
of eves

“Washington and Lee, in Lexing-

1749) with old school ways, having a
radical contingent that would fil in
a Volkswagon.”

A similar reaction occurred when
a student questioned WAL's coat and
tie tradition, The [Tuesday] Ring-tum
Phi asserted that the majority of
students wear coats and ties, and since
the student in question had mairicu
lated at WAL he should have ac
cepted the tradition of coats and ties

Any threat of change to the system
is looked upon with contempt and
derision. The “old school” ways are
perfect. Any student with a dissenting
opinion is radical and furthermore
wrong. Keep up the good work, fellas
After all WAL is “fat city,” is it not?

Dunbar: Con

By ROBERT DUNBAR

Today our little community is be-
ing graced with the presence of one of
this country’s most colorful perform-
ers, the Hon. Barry M. Goldwater.
It has been more than three years
since this man represented the Re-
publican Party in the most recent
presidential election. And during the
past couple of years, Mr. Goldwater's
audience has become quite aware of,
perhaps, an even more colorful con-
servative in the person of William
F. Buckley Jr.

All this is not to imply that Mr.
Goldwater has been inactive since his
defeat in '64, but rather to point out
that his image in the minds of most

For this reason I would like
consider the character of our
tinguished guest.

to
dis-

Ambassador Was a Chimp

First, he is amusing. Yes, Barry
has a wonderful sense of humor
which, no doubt, helped him land
the GOP nomination in °64,

After being nominated by Wash-
ington’s Alfalfa Club in their mock
“national convention,” Mr. Goldwater
delivered an acceptance speech in
which he said the following: “I don’t
want to seem critical. But our first
ambassador in space was a chimp.
And so far he’s the only one in the
State Department who hasn't made a
mistake.”

And at the same time, Mr. Gold-
water is very casual. He is an ex-
cellent speaker who quickly captivates
his audience by such realizations of
his potential as President as this: “I
would not be truthful if I said that
I was fully qualified for the office. I
seldom play golf.”

“Where are you from?”

This leads us to a very important
facet of Barry's character—he is
honest. Mr. Goldwater is really quite
a political satirist, something quite
unusual for a politician. He is a
political realist who “tells it like it
_—

Thus his comment about our go-
ernment: “How is it that our govern-
ment did better against General
Electric than they did against Cuba?”

 

And he gave us an indication of what |
his state-of-the-union mesage might |
be like: “For example, I'm going to}
propose a constitutional amendment:

Army Lieutenaut Gives Views of

water

that any decision of the Supreme
Court must make sense.”

He also said that he would retain
Chester Bowles if he had a State De-
partment and added, “He’s the mystery
guest in the Cabinet; in fact, he’s
going on ‘What’s My Line?’ as soon
as he finds out what his line is.”

But most important, Mr. Goldwater
recognizes himself for what he is:
“Tve never hesitated with an answer,
When anyone asks me how I stand
on integration, I’ve only got one
answer, ‘Where are you from?”

But as aware as Mr. Goldwater is
that his chief end is to get votes,
he is still confused about many larger
issues, For instance, concerning Red
China’s desire to get involved in the
Vietnam war Mr. Goldwater said, “It

 

is on this point that I think Americans
need a real thorough educati§n, on

China... don't think Red China
wants any part of the war. I don't
think Peiping would come into this
war under any circumstances.”

No, Mr. Goldwater, it is you who
need a better education on China!

Almost two years before Mr. Gold-
water came out with this statement,
the Red Chinese had assured for
themselves a more direct link with
the Viet Cong by inviting delegates
from South Vietnam’s National Lib-
eration Front to establish a permanent
headquaters in Peking.

“59 cents a head”

I feel that some mention of Mr.

Goldwater's personal life is necessary.

Good evening, ladies and gentle-
men. This is Henry Portent, your
correspondent in Vietnam, with this
week's seventeenth Special Document-
ary Feature on the progress of the
war.

 

As a change from the usual war
movies, this show will focus on the
daily life of an obscure second lieu-
tenant doing an unnoticed but rather)
trivial job in a second-rate supply

Support Troops. | know you would
see war movies, but hell, a
man could get shot out there.

X. about halfway up the second sand

his Knees. This is because he has been
watking through mud up to his knees,
After all, it has been raining for a/
solid week, which is why the picture |
is so lousy

 

Here he is arriving at his office, |
which as you can see used to be a
packing crate. It used to contain
poncho liners, a very popular item |
with the troops in Vietnam. See that
hole in the bottom left corner, about
three inches across? No, it was not
made by VC bullets, but by some
enterprising serviceman, who then re-
moved through it about three-quaters |
of the contents. No challenge is too)
great for Americans at war! i

There are our hero's clerks, a basic
ally lovable bunch though surly and
demoralized, Notice how well fur
nished the office is, despite its rough
exterior. All the supplies for fifteen
thousand troops come into this depot.
Some even go out again

And here comes the first truck of
the day! Decisively. Li. X opens one
eye and points at a hapless clerk,
who snarls, picks up paper and pencil,
and slinks out into the rain

This monster approaching the cam
era is a Rough Terrain Pork Lift, Li

X is using sign language to tell PFC
Smith, who is more or less driving,
where to put the stuff. PFC Smith
generally drops every third box and
runs over two others trying to pick
it up again. His grace and skill have
been compared to that of a drunken
wate buffalo.

Specialist: Brown

There goes our lieutenant to the
main office for a cup of coffee, water
dripping off the end of his nose. Here
he is complaining to Specialist Brown
about the quality of the coffee. Brown
is making insolent remarks to Li, X
in reply. The men are always making
insolent remarks to Lt. X, who doesn't
seem to know quite what to do about
it.

This is Major Y, over at battalion
headquarters. See how military he
looks? Aren't his boots shiny? Major
Y has what is known as a desk job,
which means that he doesn't walk
around in mud up to his knees much.
Instead he calls our hero up to com-
plain about his clerks’ handwriting.
Major Y likes nice neat handwriting.

Here is Lt. X again. He seems to
be irritated, but possibly he is drop-
kicking that wastebasket around the
office to keep in shape.

Say, Lt. X, isn't it time for lun...

| Where'd he go?

Here he is standing in the chow
line. When he gets to the head there
will be pot roast and dehydrated
potatoes again. This will irritate him

Mail Line

And this is the mail line. He won't
have any mail. This is fully as pre-
dictable as the pot roast and de-
hydrated potatoes, but it will ruin his
day nonetheless

Well, back to work for Lt. X, Notice
that the mud is now halfway up his
thighs.

Our hero is nervous. He is pacing
up and down,

And here comes the reason. Lt

Rugged Maroons Snap General Winning Streak

By JERRY PERLMAN
Friday Sports Editor

Verne Canfield’s General basket-
ballers sacrificed quantity for quality
last night and suffered their second
loss of the season, at the hands of
Roanoke College 70-58, in a defensive
battle played before 2,700 fans at the
Salem-Roanoke Civic Auditorium.

Stifled by the Maroons’ rugged
man-to-man defense, Washington
and Lee took only 53 shots the en-
lire game, as compared to the home
team’s 72, And while the Big Blue
out-percentaged their opponents from

the field 43 to 36 per cent, Roa-
noke’s unbelievable 100 per cent
shooting from the free-throw line

proved to be the margin of victory.

Jody Kline opened the scoring
with a basket at 19:42 in the first
half, and the Generals quickly built

every sports fan in America began |

conjecturing about the expected tour-

If this reconfrontation comes to pass
as it now seems likely, I, for one,
would have to stick by Elvin Hayes
and his mates. Despite the ready-made
excuse that Coach John Wooden of
the Bruins could have used to ex-
plan Alcindor’s less than spectacular
play, it should be noted that one man
does not a team make.

Big Lew has an outstanding sup-
porting cast in backcourt stars Mike
Warren and Lucius Allen, both of
whom receive competent aid from
cornermen Lynn Shackleford, Edgar
Lacey, and Mike Lynn. However, the
Cougars have some fine stars to fall
back on themselves, and it is the play
of these men that would make a
difference in the next meeting.

The teams have met twice recently,
and in both contests, the Big E held a
Statistical edge over his Bruin count-
erpart. In last year’s NCAA Tourna-
ment, when both were healthy, Elvin
narrowly outscored and outrebounded
Alcindor, This year’s performances
were tainted, of course, by the buga-
boo of Lew’s eyesight.

Washington U,

To Discontinue
B-Ball Support

Several hundred students demon-
| strated last week on the Washington
University campus following a Board
of Trustees decision to withdraw all
financial support from the school’s
intercollegiate basketball program.

The move by the Board was part
of a general tightening of the athletic
purse strings which also saw the re-
duction of the Bears’ 1968 football
schedule from ten to eight games.

In a letter to the St. Louis Post-

Thomas H., Eliot stated that the search
for a new head football coach and
the rising costs of maintaining a
money-making football program were
main reasons behind the decision to
cancel all basketball expenditures. As
Chancellor Eliot explained,

“Dropping varsity football would
have meant that the students who
wanted to play could not do so
here, for intramural tackle foot-
ball is clearly impractical. In con-
trast, if varsity basketball should
have to be dropped, the students
who like to play should still have
ample opportunity, as extramural
basketball is flourishing.”

In order to allow the Washington
U. student body to decide on the
future of basketball on campus, the
executive committee of the Board of
Trustees has proposed a_yet-to-be-
authorized referendum, in which stu-
dents will vote whether or not to pay
a $10 per person athletic fee for the
| maintenance of the basketball pro-
gram. The committee has stated that
an 80 per cent favorable response
from the 3600 undergraduates will be
required for passage of the referen-
dum.

hit on a 15-foot jumper to boost the
home team’s margin to five, but
Cartwright knocked it back down to
three on a lay-up. Frankie Allen’s
free throw gave the Maroons a 56-52
bulge and set up the turning point of
the game, as the Generals missed three
consecutive shots underneath follow-
ing an off-the-mark Wesselink jumper.

Roanoke then got possession and
called time-out with 2:48 remaining.
They moved to a six-point lead on a
goal-tending call on Neer, and in the
final two minutes, outscored the Gen-
erals 12-6 to annex the 70-58 victory,

High-point man for Roanoke was
freshman reserve guard Gene Luna,
who came off the bench to score 23
points for the Maroons. High scorer
for the Generals was Mike Neer with
19. Neer also led W&L in rebounds,
snaring 14 caroms,.

The Generals take their 14-2 record
to Norfolk tonight to face the highly-
regarded Monarchs of Old Dominion
in a battle of national small-college
statistical leaders. The Monarchs, who
are 15-4 and have previously beaten
Roanoke and lead the Mason-Dixon
Conference Southern Division, are
the eighteenth ranked small-college
five in the team offense department,
averaging over 97 points a game. The
Generals, on the other hand, are
seventh ranked in team defense, hav-
ing allowed only 62.4 points a game
to their opponents.

As neither team is currently rank-
ed in the small-college standings,
both see it as a “must” game to vault
into national prominence, as well as
the key battle in the contest for the
Virginia Small-College crown.

it had been much more inspiring,
also.

A staunch supporter of civil rights,
he discussed the major problem in
America’s cities today, that of racial
tensions. With the migration of
Negroes from the South to the urban
centers of the North, an increasing

for and support the Republican who
could win in November.

If Nixon doesn’t win convincingly,
Morton said, his Southern support
will probably go to Califronia Gov-
ernor Ronald Reagan. New York
Governor Nelson Rockefeller could
“pick up the pieces” of Gov, Romney’s
following, and the convention might
shape into a_ Rockefeller-Reagan
battle.

Vietnam

Sen, Morton, who has been known
as a “dove” in the Vietnam question
said that he and some of his Senate
colleagues had held back their criti-
cism of the war because of possible
miscalculation by the Hanoi govern-
ment of the American will to see the
war through to its conclusion.

“I hope,” Sen. Morton said, “Gen.
Westmoreland and others are right
when they say this is their (the Viet
Cong’s) last breath.”

“We haven't won the hearts and
minds of the people today,” he said.
“Until they show a greater will to
resist in this civil war, | don’t know
what we should do.”

Sen. Morton suggested eliminating
the “search and destroy” missions,
and concentrating on pacification pro-
grams. He also said we should stop
the strategic bombing of North Viet-
nam and concentrate on tactical bomb-
ing support for troops and bombing
of Communist supply lines, such as
the Ho Chi Minh trail.

Bombing of cities like Warsaw,
London and Rotterdam during the
Second World War, Morton pointed
out, only strengthened the resistance
of the people. The Republican posi-
tion on the war in Vietnam will be
largel ydetermined by the GOP presi-
dential nominee.

Brumback

(Continued from page 3)
the first time he competed in an in-

tercollegiate swimming meet, that
occasion on Dec. 2 when the Gen-
erals opened their season against

American University in Washington,
D.C.

A week later in Lexington against
Gettysburg College, Brumback’s 500-
yard freestyle time of 5:25.5 set both
pool and school records.

In the later meet, Brumback’s 50-
year freestyle time of 20.8 lowered
by two-tenths of a second a record
that had stood since 1940,

Finally, he set two more marks
Jan. 8 when W&L met Randolph-
Macon at the Yellow Jackets’ pool—
a 1:59.5 clocking for the 200-yard-
freestyle and a 52.1 time for the
100-yard freestyle (both were pool
records),

\ there is so much localism.” He ad-

problem of unemployment has de-
veloped. As mayor, McKeldin fought
to break down racial barriers in Balti-
more. He secured many jobs for un-
employed Negroes and was with them
constantly during the summer months |
trying to avert riot. He summed it
up by saying, “the Negroes are my
friends.”

In a panel discussion afterward,
Gov. McKeldin was questioned about
his support of President Lyndon
Johnson in the 1964 Presidential elec-
tion. He answered by saying, Re-
publican or not, he was stil lan
American and could not vote for a
man who would not support a civil
rights bill, The first Republican gov-
ernor of Maryland in many years
also stated that he would support
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller for this
year’s Republican presidential nomi-
nee.

In discussing the differences between
the two major parties, McKeldon said
that he saw none. Many Republicans
vote for Democratic proposals and
Democrats support Republican pro-
posals. In addition, a politician’s party
policies are often determined by his
constituents’ races, creeds and other
factors.

Hess

(Continued from page 1)
of Government. He has previously
served as special assistant to Presi-
dent Eisenhower and as an assistant
to the Senate Minority Whip.

Concerning the Republican presi-
dential hopefuls, Hess said, “Nixon's
main problem is that he is not start-
ing from scratch, but with the scars
of 20 years of political life.” Later he
observed that “the only way Nixon
can get the nomination is to establish
himself as a winner.”

Romney and Nixon currently have
the advantage over other candidates,
according to Hess, since they have
already declared their candidacy.
Also, Romney, Rockfeller and Percy
have the most to offer “in terms of
image appeal.” However, Hess felt
that Rockefeller’s candidacy might be
bad for the party, since “if one po-
tential candidate can re-open the
wounds of 1964, it is most likely to
be Rockefeller.”

On Republican hopes in Congress,
Hess foresaw “a modest gain in the
Senate—perhaps eight seats.” Republi-
can control of the House, now only
31 seats away, is a possibility, but
Hess could not “really tell, because

mitted that “in a sweep the Republi-
cans could take control of the House.”

Hess observed many “innovative
elements” in the Republican Party.
He reported = that “considerable
thought has been given to the pos-
sibility of a volunteer army,” and
that “any Republican president would
try to end the war in Vietnam.”

is making our lieutenant drop his

and they are rushing the box to a
special locked warehouse under armed
escort. Can it be a new weapon
which the Viet Cong would go to any
lengths to steal? Is it gold boullion.
radios, spare truck parts?
Dog Food

No. It is dog food. The Vietnamese
will eat it if they get their hands
on it.

This is Lt. X wandering around the
yard. He trips over a box. He has
been tripping over that same box for
days, and the Colonel keeps asking
what is in it. Lt. X doesn’t know.
Clearly action is called for! A look
of grim determination steals over the
lieutenant’s face. Decision wells up|
in his eyes. He picks up the box and)
drops it behind a stack of bigger)
boxes. Now it is out of his way and |
the Colonel will never see it. Well
done, Lt. X.

Now our hero and all these other |

officers are leaving the yard. They |
are on their way to this big meet-|
ing. Every day at this time, they have
this big meeting.

Here we are inside the big meeting
room. Col. Z and Maj. Y are doing
all the talking. I can’t understand what
they are talking about, but then I am
not a highly trained supply expert
like Lt. X. It is obvious that he
understands every word. He is asleep.
in fact, all the. officers are asleep
except Col. Z and Maj. Y. Such is
the electric atmosphere in which high
level policy decisions are made.

Now the day is over, and Lt, X
is free to go to his hut, where he
will get moderately drunk and crawl
into bed, praying that there won't be
an alert to mess with his sleep.

So ends another day in the life
of Lt. X, the man behind the man
behind the man with the gun. Not
a glamorous life, you may say, nor
an exciting one, and probably a
pretty rotten subject for a TV show.
But ask yourself this question: where)

 

 

would our country be without him in| |

Vietnam?

We don’t know. And neither does)
he. But you better believe he is will-
ing to give it a try.

Goldwater Criticized By Dunbar

this area: “My wife came home the

(Continued from page 2)

The Young Republican National
Federation is a case in point. This
group of conservative young Ameri-
cans—over half a million strong—
have taken the original Goldwater
philosophy and given it a new direct-
ion. The principles are still the same,
but the new emphasis is on efficient
organization and a_ unified party
effort. The dedication is still con-
servative, but 1964 was an educa-
tional experience, and the primary
objective this year is to win,

Barry Goldwater, more than any
other man, has been responsible for
this Republican resurgence. So while
the forces of liberalism continue to
revel in their landslide victory of

because she had to pay 59 cents for
a head of lettuce. This is the first
time in our 32 years of married life
I've ever heard my wife complain
about anything.”

After all, Barry is really just a
country boy in the American tradi-
tion, who was born in a log cabin.
But as our honest Barry says it, “I
had it moved to Phoenix, and except
for some air conditining, a swimming
pool, a bowling alley, a bar, a shoot-
ing range, and a golf course, it re-
mains the simple log cabin it always
was,”

But Barry’s wonderful insight into
important issues can only be re-
vealed by his attitude toward the
war in Vietnam. Mr. Goldwater would
like to escalate the war, because he
feels that “no argument is ever won,
no sale is ever made, no point is
ever made without escalation.” That
seems to be a logical assessment of
the problem. Apparently Mr. Gold-

| water was not satisfied with LBJ’s

four years past, let them reflect upon |
the fact that the very victory they |

celebrate has fanned the flames of

their own destruction. We have Barry |

| Goldwater to thank for that,

1 am not quite sure whether Mr.

he even cares. If the former is true,
it might be interesting to consider
quite a recent occurrence on January
8. On that day the South Vietnamese

Village of Ben Suc was bulldozed flat
by our troops. The following ac-
count is by a reporter who talked
to some of the Ben Suc villagers at
their refugee camp: “I asked them
whether, if the war ended, they would
stay in their spotless new village or
go back to Ben Suc, which they knew
had been wiped from the face of
the earth. They said they would
return—to plant rice and to be near
the tombs of their ancestors. What if
the VC were there? They said they
would not return to Ben Suc in that
case. This made them appear to be
anti-VC, as was triumphantly pointed
out to by a listening AID man, So
I asked them why they wouldn't re-
turn to Ben Suc if the VC were
there: Because the Americans would
come back and destroy the village
again.”

Mr. Goldwater attempted to realize
these ambitions when he tried to get
into the Vietnam war as a major-
general in the Air Force. And prob-
ably Barry’s most astute observation
on the war in Vietnam came when
he admitted after his bid was turned
down by the Air Force: “I can see
their point. They need more major-
generals out here like a bull needs
four tits.” No, whatever Barry is, he
is not a killer, and Vietnam does not
need more of them.
