THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper

The Girls

Ever since Yale and Vassar announced their forthcoming
merger, breaking that invisible barrier which used to exist
between all women’s colleges and all men’s colleges, students
at the various institutions around Virginia have been specula-
tively eyeing their neighbors’ campuses and filling the columns
of their respective newspapers with letters and articles eulogiz-
ing the intellectual benefits to be obtained from co-education.

 

“Picture it,” said an anonymous letter to the University of
Virginia’s Cavalier Daily recently: “Seated next to you in
class, goddess in long blonde hair—sensual lips, oozing sex-
uality—long legs extending through micro skirt, sending waves
of excitement.” (A Sweet Briar columnist, reading this, com-
mented to her readers: “Aren’t we glad they don’t know how
it really would be? Any distance surely makes the heart grow
fonder.”’)

Assuming, however, that there are also other, more in-
tellectual results to be obtained from co-education—something
on a little higher plane than that envisioned by the U.Va.
letter-writer—the idea of a feminine touch in our education
is not one to be ignored. “Intellectually,” one of our own
columnists has written, “women are here to stay in all fields
of endeavor. It is generally recognized that they are signifi-
cantly more serious students than men. Their attitude would
do W&L no harm.”

Of course, no one is seriously contending that W&L
should, like Yale, absorb girls into its student body. “What
is needed,” wrote our columnist, “is a setup that renders the
benefits of both the coed and segregated situation.”” A number
of other students and professors here have been heard to say
much the same thing.

It seems that similar thoughts are running through the
minds of some of our neighbors. Next week rehearsals begin
for a dramatic reading of a new play to be presented here and
at Mary Baldwin College by a cast drawn from both schools.
The event is the first time within memory that any such joint
dramatic presentation has been attempted.

A more ambitious program is presently before the student
curriculum committee at Randolph-Macon Women’s College,
which would establish a joint seminar with W&L beginning
next semester. The project’s supporters hope to make it
eventually possible for students to take the program for credit;
and the enthusiasm which appears to have been aroused for it
among both faculty and students there is a good omen for
its success. At present, contact is being made with organizations
here in order to raise support for the project at W&L.

The pious clergymen who founded Augusta Academy in
1749 for the instruction of young gentlemen would no doubt
have looked with a baleful eye on joint seminars with young
ladies, and perhaps for their day and age they were correct.
At W&L we still haven’t progressed much farther—most
Wa&L students seem to regard the girls at nearby schools as
creatures who date but never think. A Wé&L-Macon seminar
might be a big step in a different direction.

A Minor Complaint

We'd also like to pass on a complaint we've been hearing
a lot about lately; a number of freshmen are beginning to
notice just how seldom their dorm counselors are ever around.
Granted, a dorm counselor's duties are so nebulous that he
can hardly be blamed if he goes to the movies instead of sitting
around his room thinking up ways to be a dorm counselor.
But there are also dorm counselors who haven't been seen since
freshman camp. We're reminded of the football player a few
years ago who had a refrigerator blocking the door into one
of his dorm sections, so that the door couldn't be opened.
He didn’t like the freshmen in that section.

We suppose that most of the dorm counselors are reason-
ably conscientious. But there is a small minority of counselors
who ought to take a good second look at their responsibilities
and fulfill them.

Dance Board Problems, Part Il

 

By RON KESSLER

(Editor’s note: The following is
the second of a series of articles
concerning the Washington and Lee
Dance Board and its problems).

The Washington and Lee Dance
Board has problems, as shown in last
Friday’s Ring-tum Phi. The major
problem is the fact that the combos
which are consistently chosen by
Dance Board polls of the student
body are irresponsible.

As a case in point, Jr. Walker
signed a contract with the Dance
Board early in September, and re-
ceived one-half of the contract price.
On Friday, 27 October, one day be-
fore the scheduled performance,
WA&L’s agent, Stan Rubin of the Col-
lege Entertainment Agency in New
York, called to inform the Board
that Walker would not show for the
obviously ludicrous reason that his
organist could not be with him,
Walker also gave up two other con-
certs in the South, at $2500 each, a
total of $7500 forfeited for the sake
of an organ. It appears that when
a group can demand and get $2500
for a fifty minute concert, it can
afford to dump on a few measly
colleges.

Contracts are strictly ome-way
deals, in favor of the entertainment.
So-called “act of God” clauses per-
mit groups to back out at any time
for such “acts of God” as automobile

Irresponsible Groups

of which are next to impossible to
prove. Car trouble was Sam and
Dave's excuse for backing out of
Springs last year.

An article (bylined Herm Schoen-
feld) in the 5 October 1966 edition
of Variety headed “NO-SHOWS
VEX CAMPUS MKT: Eye Legal
Curb Vs. Delinquents,” began

“The college market for  profes-
sional talent, which has grown into
one of the most lucrative sectors of
show business in the last few years,
is still being plagued by irresponsible
performers, Althouga paying top dol-
lar and providing ideal working con-
ditions, the student concert promoters
are being victimized by numerous
singers and combos who accept dates
and then duck out at the last minute.

“The students who promote the
campus shows repeatedly have been
forced to search desperately for sub-
stitutions when the original name
booked for that date has hung them
up until the last moment. In some

cases the talent pleads illness; in
other cases, transportation break-
downs.

“In most cases, it’s believed that
the talent accepted the college date
on the premise that if it could be
fitted into an overall booking pat-
tern, it would be played. If it doesn’t
fit, tough luck for the colleges.”

There are certain people who are

ation, although the immediate future

Interview With

(Since Sunshine Governor Klaude
Quirk will speak at the 1968 Mock
Republican Convention, The Friday

Quirk: Why sure boys. You got any
questions for me, just shoot, Always
happy to help out young people.
R+ Phi: Do you think the South
will rise again?

Quirk: I'm from Alabama, God rest
its soul, and quite frankly we some-
times like to think that we're mem-
bers of the United States, too. I hear
people say “South” like it’s a dirty

Phi: Do you see any chance

stuff. Why as | was telling H. Rap

in Tampa yesterday there's no such
thing as white people or Negroes

| R-t Phi: | hope you won't take this

Besides that Americans don't vote

person working for improvement in
this area is Stan Rubin, the Dance
Board agent. To continue from the
same Variety issue,

“Stan Rubin, head of College En-
tertainment Inc., which represents
colleges in the buying of talent, is
moving to curb the irresponsibles.
He’s attempting to organize the col-
lege deans, who supervise the campus
concerts, to put them in a position to
take legal steps against delinquent
talent.

“Rubin is also trying to devise a
new type of contract with a cutoff

date. If the talent or the talent
agency does not return a_ contract
before a_ specified deadline, there

would be no deal.

“Rubin said that under existing
union and contractual regulations, the
talent has the colleges over a barrel.
Firstly, the colleges must sign the
proposed contract and send along a
deposit, usually amounting to 50%
of the total price. Then the schools
have to sit back and wait until the
talent returns the contract.

“Sometimes, the contract is re-
turned after the date is played. Some-
times, it’s never returned since the
act decided to run out on the date
because it was too far away from
the last booking .. .

“Rubin estimates that about 50%
of the performers booked for the
college circuit are guilty of playing
fast and loose with the schools. He
said that the top names, who can

By WILLIAM G. HEIGOLD
Assistant Professor of French

One of the infallible and most re-
warding tests of the timeless veracity
and beauty of great myths, regardless
of native culture, is their adaptation
and reinterpretation by other cultures
and subsequent generations. The 20th
century has often done impressive and
strikingly successful justice to ancient
myths in several media.

The theater and the cinema may
be especially proud of homage which
they have paid to the “Ancients,”
particularly to the Greeks. We need
only recall the legends of Oedipus,
Electra, Antigone, or Orpheus and
many plays and films of our century
come to mind

Racine or Euripides

What has prompted this prelude is
the fact that the Lyric Theater (Lex
ington’s Opera Comique) is currently
presenting Phaedra, a film of Jules

Dassin released in America in 1962
The film is supposed to be, it seems
an adaptation of Racine’s I7th-cen

tury reinterpretation of
tragedy, Mippolytus, one of the most
provocative of Cireek legends. We
know that it is based on Racine’s play
because 1) Phaedra is the principal

7
Euripides’s |
|

 

character lin Euripides’s play, it is
Hippolyius}, 2) the character Aricia
does not appear in Euripides, and 3)
Phaedra does not write any letter in-|
culpating Hippolytus as she does
in the Greek play

What has Dassin done with (to?)
Racine’s Phedre’ lt would be unjust
to say that he is not clever in his
modernization of the play, Perhaps |
his most successful towr de force is

Phaedra: “Panders To Popular Taste”

which
char

forces Hippolytus’s car (i.e.

chariot) off the road.

There are other clever moderniza- |

tions: Theseus is a shipping magnate
(Theseus is in Poseidon’s debt);
Theseus is respected and admired (for
economic reasons) as was the Greek
hero (he had slain the Minotaur),
and Hippolytus (who is called Alexis
in the film, as though no one should
be named Hippolytus) has eyes only
for sports as the Euripidean
hero was more enthusastic about the
hunt (the cult of Diana) than about
the chase (the cult of Aphrodite)
Moreover, Phaedra, Theseus,
Ocenone are admirable examples of

command around $5000 per night,
can be depended on to show up
promptly.

“The lesser acts, who get from
$500 to $2,000 per night, are hardly
as dependable and their rate of
truance from firm commitments is

discouraging to both Rubin and the
colleges. In one case, Rubin sent an
agent a deposit four months ago for
a certain group, but now it turns out
that the agent can’t find the act.

“Rubin pointed out that now firm,
new regulations have to be set down
in light of the enomous growth of the
college market for talent.”

Simply contracting entertainment
to come to W&L is a serious problem.
For one thing, the dates are de-
termined by the University, and are
fixed; it is impossible for the Dance
Board to vary its dates to correspond
with open dates of desired enter-
tainers,

According to Dance Board Presi-
dent Paul Brower, “contracting these
groups is a result of a long process
of elimination, We have to consider
at least fifteen names before we can
get one who will meet our price, and
who is available in the sense of not
being booked on our dates, and being
in this area at the time. Some groups
won't perform unless they have at
least one other concert in the area.
Also, a great number of groups
whom we might consider play only
only on the West Coast or in Eng-

land.”

“Give ‘em a deflated football,”
said Lee McLaughlin when asked how
he was planning to stop Southwest-
ern’s pass-crazy offense this Saturday.
The Memphis outfit lives only to pass
an opponent to death, having thrown
¢ so far for a 215.5 yards a game av-
erage and eight touchdowns, and this
week faces a W&L defense that has
most times this year been great, but
on some occasions, far from it.

“We'll have to be ready,” says Mc-
Laughlin, “that’s all there is to it.|
Naturally we're expecting them to|
pass, but you can't forget their run-|
ning game. Tailback Bob Croker is
averaging just under four yards a
carry.”

Still, the W&L defense, which has
intercepted 16 enemy passes to date,

Racine Is

‘Obliterated’

(Continued from page 2)

may afford one of the most memor-
able scenes of seduction in films, and
one of the most photographically
beautiful (as well as one of the most
titillating to students), but the whole
raison d'etre of the tragedy is thereby
destroyed. It is his resistance which
infuriates Phedre and increases her
feeling of guilt.

If he has yielded, there is no rea-
son for her anger (Except that she
is stuck with Perkins), There is no
reason for her terrible lie to Theseus
which ironically destroys Hippolytus.
Oenone and Aricia no longer have
any role to play.

In short, both Euripides and Racine
are obliterated. The film then de-
pends for its tragedy upon Phaedra’s
avowal to Theseus (A la Princesse de |
Cleves), which is subject matter for
soap Opera, not “high tragedy.” (Time,
Oct. 26, 1962, assures you that you
will see “high tragedy”).

What will you see? Not high
tragedy! Not Racine! You will find
potential for what might have been
an exceptional modernization of a
Greek legend. Some exceptionally
beautiful filming. Rewarding acting
on the part of Mercouri and Vallone.
A desire aroused, | hope, to read
Racine’s Phedre. But that can be
accomplished without the film.

stepping stone to the NAIA tourna-

not, have already packed up
uniforms for the season and sup-
posedly do not want to bother shak-
ing out the mothballs. So the VISA
Tournament, supposed to be con-
tested between the numbers one
through four soccer teams in the
state, has devolved into a meaning-
less battle between the state's third
i(W&L), fourth (EM), sixth (U.Va.),
and ninth (VMI) ranked teams,

The only real loser in the comings
and goings that has brought the tour-
nament to its present low state is the
Washington and Lee soccer team. The
Generals started the season slowly
and dropped early important games,
but finally jelled as a unit and finish-
ed strongly to post a respectable 7-3
record, If Roanoke and Randolph-
Macon had decided to play in the
tourney, the Blue would have had
a chance to prove that it was not the
same team that had previously lost
to the Maroons and the Jackets 3-0
and 2-1, respectively.

But VISA is an ignored organiza-
tion, except by Coach Joe Lyles, who
was instrumental in its founding. Al-
though the dates for the tournament
are set for as far ahead as 1975, the
Virginia schools who belong to other
soccer-playing conferences (all do ex-
cept W&L and Eastern Mennonite)
seem to hold other loyalties above
their nominal VISA committment.

Granted that Roanoke seems to

Jinx Time At Wilson Field
With Lynx As Victim

(Continued from page 3)

If two things should help W&L's
bid for a second CAC victory, (the
Generals are now 1-1-0 in the league),
it should be Andy Bloom's throwing
coupled with Homecoming festivities,
an occasion thath usually produces a
winner.

Senior quarterback Bloom, who
has connected on 54 of 104 passes
for 598 yards and two scores, threw
for 224 yards against Sewanee dur-
ing his best day of the season, com-
pleting 19 out of 33 attempts.

And if the Homecoming jinx works
on Southwestern like it has against
teams for the past seven years, then
the Generals must have a tremendous
edge.

portant enough to make the eligible

Perhaps the only way to do _ this
would be to make the Virginia State
Soccer Championship hinge on the
outcome of the VISA Tournament,
a move which would undoubtedly be
much criticized, but seems to be the
only way to give the tournament the
attention it deserves.

The Generals, seeded number one
this weekend by default, should chalk
