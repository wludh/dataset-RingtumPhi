IFC Deferred Rush Committee

In preparing our proposal for de-
ferred rush, we have attempted to
create a plan that
will be workable
and practical for
all concerned part-
ies — a plan that
answered all the
faculty's past ob-
jections and that
was in the best
interest of both
freshmen and the
fraternity system
of Washington and
Lee

   

Huntley Johnson

As an alternative to the limited
contact which we have proposed there
is the possibility of an unlimted con-
tact system for de-
ferred rush. After
considering these
two possibilities at
length, we have
chosen to limit
contact during the
first semester for
the folowing rea-
sons:

(1) If there is
too much pressure
on the freshmen in
one week of in-
tensified rush, try to imagine the pres-
sures that whole semester of intensi-
fied (unlimited contact) rush would
place on freshmen (as well as fra-
ternity men).

 

Bruce Downing

(2) By conducting rush in a casual,
relaxed manner over a long period
of time it is hoped that the freshmen
will better be able to choose the
house in which they will best fit and
be most happy.

(3) If unlimited contact were al-
lowed, it would completely wreck
the fraternity system financially.
Competition for freshmen’s interest
would cause fraternities to at first
try hiring the best (and most ex-
pensive) live entertainment for their
house. This desire to attract rushees
might even lead to the fraternity’s
paying for meals and drinks for the
freshmen.

(4) Any rules that might be estab- |
lished with regard to weekend con-
tact would be virtually unenforceable.

(5) An unlimited amount of contact
would create an inequality among the
fraternities due to the scattered loca-
tions of the houses. It is very doubt-
ful that the houses on Nelson and
Main Streets would even see a frac-
tion of the students that would gather
at the much more conveniently locat-
ed Red Square Houses.

EC recommends relaxing
of liquor and female rules
in upperclass dormitories

In accordance with the recent mo-
tion passed by the Student Affairs
Commitiee, the EC strongly recom
mends that the administration take
immediate action to construct com
fortable lounges for the upperclass
men and Law students living in Baker
and Davis dormitories

This motion was passed by the Stu
dent Affairs Committee in light of the
fact that the new Student Union will
not be completed for another year
and that fraternity upperclassmen
and Law students living in University

 

housing are presently without an ade
quate facility in which to entertain
female guests

lt will be understood that girls and |

liquor will be permitted in these
lounges only with resident upper: |
classmen and Law students. The EC

has realized the needs of these men
for the coming year and urges that
econsiruction of the proposed lounges
take place over summer Vacation

The Lee Associates concept was
established in 1967 by the Board of
Trustees as a means of providing
special honor and involvement for
the University’s “most devoted and
most generous” friends and potential
friends. Initially, invitations to join
Associates were sent to those
who previously had contributed gen-
erously to the University.

Contributions to W&L by the 82
charter Lee Associates had totalled
about $43,000 in each of the three
years prior to the inauguration of
the Associates program. About $100,-
000, then, in addition to their normal
sum level of giving appears to have
been realized through the inducement
of membership in the Associates.

Mr. Hotchkiss voiced pleasure at
the initial response to the program,
noting that it exceed the Development
Office's expectations by nearly $70,-
000.

Any individual who contributes
$1,000 or more becomes a member
of the Associates, he said, whether
the money goes to the Alumni Fund,
the Parents’ Fund or the general en-
dowment fund. The new program, he
said, is designed primarily to stimulate

next year's rising sophomore class.

The number of applications this
year was down to 1,050 from last

Farrar attributed this decrease to a
leveling off in the number of stu-
dents entering college each year and
to a significant improvement in sec-
ondary school guidance.

sion, approximately 700 were ac-

Number 55

No contact or summer rush
basis of deferred rush plan

By REEVE KELSEY
News Editor

In a meeting last Wednesday night
Huntley Johnson, chairman of the
IFC’s Deferred Rush Committee, pre-
sented the tentative plan for the de-
ferred rush that the faculty has re-
quested for the 1969-1970 school
year. The plan features a long series
of open houses beginning in October
and a tightly controlled no-contact
provision.

The open houses would begin on
the first Monday in October and last
until the last Thursday before exams.
The open houses would be only
Monday through Thursday. After
lunch each Monday the rushee would
sign up in the Student Union build-
ing for up to two open houses, At
6:30 he would be picked up at the
Student Union building. Only those
houses that now have cars during
open houses would be allowed them
next year.

The rushees must be returned by
7:30. The fines for lateness would
be $10 for every five minutes of late-
ness up to 25 minutes, when the
case would be considered by the
Judicial Board. A rushee would be
unable to return to a given house
until after the seventh week of rush.
There would be no alcoholic bever-
ages served at the open houses.

Each fraternity would have only
one open house a week; there would
be no rushing on Friday nights. This
will correspond to the one night a
week that pledges now eat at the
houses.

The final formal rush week would
be the first week of the second
semester running from Monday to
Thursday with a last day of open
houses on Monday night and formal
rush dates beginning Tuesday.

The contact rules have been made
especially stringent. The tentative
article concerning contact _ states:
“There will be no contact between
fraternity members and perspective
rushees (i.e. freshmen and non-fra-
ternity transfer students) except when
specified. Rushees may at no time
visit lodgings of an upperclassmen
who is a fraternity member with the
exception of a dorm counselor in the
dorms.”

Other rules concerning contact also
prohibit contact during vacations—
Thanksgiving and Christmas. Fresh-
men will also be prohibited from rid-
ing in any car belonging to or con-
taining a fraternity member. This in-
cludes the outlawing of summer rush
and rush publications.

The penalties for breaking the con- |
tact rules are $250 for the first of-|
fense, $500 for the second offense, |
and suspension of rushing privileges’

 

for the third offense. A freshman will
lose his rush privileges for a semester
if he breaks the contact rules. These
restrictions do not extend to the co-op,
the classrooms, and the athletic fields.

Huntley Johnson said that his com-
mittee had attempted to choose a
middle road between a plan which was
too specific to prevent a flexible
adaptation to the demands of the
moment, or a plan too vague to be
effective. Many of the house presi-
dents were concerned about the
vagueness of many of the regulations
when faced with the stiffness of the
fines.

Johnson explained the reasoning
behind his committee’s decision for
the no-contact rules: he stated this
would hurt many of the houses that
were removed from campus, as fresh-
men would tend to congregate at the
houses within walking distance; any
weekend contact rules would be virtu-

 

ally unenforceable and could easily
result in band escalation as well as
increased costs to provide liquor and
meals for freshmen at a time when
the fraternities will have to closely
watch their finances.

Johnson also noted that this would
also result in extreme social pressure
for an extended period of time on
both the fraternities and the fresh-
men. For these reasons the Deferred
Rush Committee decided it would ulti-
mately be in the best interests of the
fraternities to invoke a stringent no-
contact regulation, for the limited
weekend rushing or contact would be
too expensive, and that open-contact
would be patently unfair to many of
the houses.

The committee will put the rough
outline of the plan into a final version
and submit it to both the faculty and
the IFC next September for official
approval.

 

Maintenance fund required
of borrowing fraternities

The Board of Trustees has voted
to require fraternities that borrow
money from the University for house
improvements to establish individual
maintenance funds to help take care
of upkeep over the 25-year loan-re-
payment period.

The maintenance fund program re-
quires each borrowing fraternity to
set aside a sum, equal to three per
cent of the valuation of the house
building, to be drawn upon as need-
ed. The measure was passed at the
Trustees’ meeting Saturday.

The University has had a practice,
which the Trustees said they plan to
continue, of offering remodelling-
loans to chapters at four per cent
interest. The loans are repayable over
25 years. By voting to continue the
loan-making practice, the Trustees
appear to have implicitly accepted
that fraternities are here to stay, at
least for 25 years.

The maintenance funds, which will
be supervised by the University but
which can be drawn upon only by
the chapters, would hopefully en-
courage chapters to keep their houses
in shape all the time, rather than
putting them in shape with a massive
University loan every quarter-cen-
tury and then doing nothing until it
is necessary to borrow another vast
sum.

The University will also make
twice-yearly inspection visits to each
borrowing fraternity chapter, to sug-
gest needed repairs. The University

 

would not be able to require any
such repairs to be made, not even
from the University-supervised maint-
enance fund.

It was pointed out that no house
is required to borrow from the Uni-
versity, but that those which do
choose to borrow in the future will
be required to establish the three
per cent funds. No non-borrowing
chapters would be required to set up
the funds,

The University loans, which are
available for reasonable structural
improvements and repairs to houses,
are obtained by application directly
to the Board of Trustees. The Board
passes on each loan application in-
dividually, taking into consideration
the chapter's willingness and ability
to repay.

By making loans at four per cent,
when the same money could be
earning more by investing it in securi-
ties, the University is considered to
be subsidizing fraternities to the ex-
tent of the difference between four
per cent and the going commercial

A very good year

It has been customary for retiring editors to write a swan-song

“review of the year” in the last
to break with tradition?

It has been a full year and,

new president whose vigor, enthusiasm and ability need no
further endorsement from us. { The faculty’s monthly legisla-
tive meetings have suddenly and happily become occasions
for purposeful change wherever, it seems, change is needed.

{ Extracurricular programs—from evening lectures to ODK
Tap Day to Contact to the Mock Convention to all the less-
spectacular but no-less-significant regular activities—were un-
precedented in their own quality as well as in the interest they
stimulated. { The New Left, small but not lazy, emerged into
respectability here this year and conducted its affairs with a
degree of responsibility that was at first surprising to many.

* The development program came into its own; and if its
undertakings are not yet highly visible, the future of Wash-
ington and Lee has already been, and will continue to be,
markedly influenced and immeasurably benefited by them. 4
While the Inter-Fraternity Council was not exactly characteriz-
ed by dynamism, fraternities individually showed themselves
to be capable of overcoming, through their own positive
action and through a new aversion to negative action, the ugly
image they gave themselves last year. { And while the Executive
Committee was similarly less-than-energetic, legislatively, stu-
dent affairs seem to have been taken care of in other ways, and
at least as successfully as an energetic EC might have done.

A great many questions were answered, solutions to others
are actively being sought and arrived at, and—just as import-
antly—new, pertinent questions are being asked. It has been
a full year and, yes, a good one.

It is not possible for the retiring editor to leave this news-
paper and this University without trying, however inade-
quately, to indicate his indebtedness to the staff members who
worked under him. Thirty-five years ago, another retiring
Ring-tum Phi editor wrote: “If our readers think there has been
anything good in the paper this year, they can credit the

staff.” So they can now. We

manding, usually impatiently, perfection from the staff. It
gave close to it. In this regard, the work of the News Editor,
Bill Wilkerson, and the Editorial-Page Editor, Joe Wilson,
deserves particular mention and deepest thanks. They and the
staff under them have served the Ring-tum Phi well this year—
and have done it in a way that made us look forward to the
first of each week for the pleasure of their company. We can-
not forget any of it—or any of them.

‘Lest he begin
to lose his humility’

We know an editor who has a
desk, to remind him of certain
down to write his editorials:

“Tf all the editors of the papers in the countries where
liberty of the press exists were to be assembled, we
should have a CREW to which you would NOT con-
fide a dog that you would value, still less your honour

and reputation.”

By DEE POSED

Once again, as spring rolls by and
exams rush toward us, that grand
old institution, the Moose Lodge
Carnival, is under way on the Goshen
road, This year, Young's Amusements,
whose slogan ominously enough is
“Young for the young,” promises to
present attractions which will excite
people of all ages.

For example, in addition to the
regular concessions and corny games,
there are several “thrill rides.” There
is alo an animal display and a
new attraction, a mandrill: a large
baboon which according to Lee Pruitt,
manager of Young's, “changes color
according to its mood,” The mandrill
is billed as the “Creature of the
Cameroons,” and was purchased for |
$1,000. “Life” carried an article on |
“the Creature” in 1963,

This reporter was fortunate enough
to meet and interview two charming
ladies who are featured in one of

 

the shows. Miss “Candy Kisses,” age
24, and Miss “Candy Delight,” age)
22, are sisters from New Orleans
who are known as the “Candy Twins.”

 

They have been performing together
for five years.

Both Miss Kisses, whose measure-
ments are 40-25-38, and Miss Delight
(37-23-38) perform in night clubs dur-
ing the winter season, They have been |
featured at the Stork Club, the Club)
Capri, and the Club Galore.

Come the summer season, “the)
Candy Twins” join carnivals and play
mostly county and state fairs, They |
usually play college towns and mili-
tary bases two or three times a year,
Both ladies agree that they enjoy |
performing in college towns because
“most college boys are gentlemen.”

A reply

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

After reading the two articles by
Reed Byrum about student housing,
we would like to speak in defense
of Hillside Terrace.

It is true that Hillside was con-
structed in 1946 as “temporary” bar-
racks for veterans returning to W&L
and that the apartments here have
their limitations; however, to say that
they have “decayed into a rodent-
infested, insect-ridden, rotten health
and safety hazard” is totally untrue
and abhorrent to us. Since we were
not interviewed, we would like to
answer the questions put to several
of our neighbors.

(Continued on page 4)

A challenge

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:
Some recent comments in the
Ring-tum Phi regarding the recruit-

ment of students from minority groups |

and low-income backgrounds, and re-
garding the heterogeneity of the stu-
dent body generally, fail to note an
important alternative for dealing with
the problem. Possibly the most effect-
ive recruiting of new students can
be done by present students them-
selves.

The resources of the Admissions
Office are quite limited and its opera-
tions necessarily confined to rather
formal and official contacts for the
most part. Members of our student
body, on the other hand, are widely
scattered over the country during
summer and other vacations and are
often in touch with potential stu-
dents of just the sort of background
and interests that our admissions office
can not reach. The informal contacts
with Washington and Lee, established
through present students, can be of
great value to the admissions pro-
gram in supplementing the current
effort.

The quality of her students is prob-
ably a university's most important
asset. Those men who wish to attend
Washington and Lee can be sure of
a careful consideration of their appli-
cations and, if present standards can
be maintained, the financial support
from the University which they and
their families cannot provide. To reach
the men we need and want is greatly
important. Washington and Lee stu-
dents can make a vital contribution
to our efforts to do so,

Those to whom Washington and
Lee seems not what it ought to be
do not always appreciate that they
bear a responsibility for making their
University what they wish it to be.
Washington and Lee is clearly in the
process of significant change. The
direction which that change will take
hangs greatly on the devotion, de-
termination, and hard work of all of
us, not only the faculty and ad-
ministration,

By RICHARD NASH
Student Body President

   

After reading the editorial by
“N.S.K.” in last Friday’s Ring-tum
Phi, I made the |
comment that I | wi
might write an

answer to it in de-
fense of this year’s
Executive Commit-
tee. A person over-
hearing me re-
marked, “Why do —
that? Everyone
knows it’s written
by an uninformed
person. No one
will pay any at-

Richard Nash

tention to it anyway.”

I had to agree that that was

probably true, But unfortunately “un-
informed...” people somehow man-
age to get into print around here,
and the risk is run that someone will
believe them. Therefore, 1 am writing
the following in order to point out the
several errors in “N.S.K.’s” editorial,
and also to point out some of the
things this year’s E.C, has done which
“N.S.K.” failed to mention.
@ “N.S.K.’s” first point (appearing
first no doubt because it involved his
fraternity brother) was that we fired
the head of the Curriculum Commit-
tee without his knowledge and ap-
pointed a new chairman.

First of all, it was not done with-
out his knowledge. He was asked to
appear for four weeks straight and
also told he might be removed. He
never appeared, and when he was
removed, a letter was sent to him at
his fraternity house informing him
of the action.

It might also be mentioned here
that the new chairman has accomp-
lished about five times as much in
two months as the old one did in
five.

@ It is true that we allocated $400
to the S.B.A. for the first semester
to help them in the publication of
the Law Review. However, unlike
“N.S.K.” states, we did not postpone
action in giving them funds for the
second semester. In fact, the S.B.A.
neither asked for nor expected funds
during the second semester. What we
did do, however, was reallocate the
student body head tax so the S$.B.A.
would receive additional funds in the
future.

@ We did revise the Cold Check fine
and the Cold Check Committee's
operations, What was wrong with that,
“N.S.K."?

@ We did give the Library Commit-

tee the permission to choose the books
for the Chitwood Memorial Fund.

@ “N.S.K.” is correct in saying that
the E.C, defeated a motion to in-
crease freshman representation on the
Library and Cold Check Committees.
What “N.S.K.” failed to report (may-
be he didn’t know) was that we later
reversed that and appointed more
freshmen than ever before to those
committees.

@ It is true that we chose not to
divide the E.C. into a judicial and
legislative branch.

@ “N.S.K.” claims that we suggested
that a schedule of mid-term exams
be set up, but that “the faculty beat
us to the punch” by abolishing mid-
semester grades.

Well, I wasn’t aware that we were
competing with the faculty for ac-
complishments. But that is not the
point. The point is that the sug-
gestion was only one of three that
we made to the faculty.

Another was that there be no mid-
semester grades, and the other was
that if there were, that there be a
note on the grades that they were
only temporary.

@ It is true that we supported the
collection of freshman dues for Fancy
Dress Weekend. I might remind
“N.S.K.” that had the dues not been

out a doubt this

most important de-

Everyone must
realize how, in
many parts of the
country, living,

alongside of a
Negro is taboo—
especially by the adult generation.

On the other hand, everyone had

Student Curriculum Committee

 

By SWEDE HENBERG

While there may be a consensus
among both students and faculty that
some sort of cur-
riculum = changes
are needed for
Washington and
Lee, the problem of
offering alternatives
is by no means a
simple one. To
that end both the
faculty and the
Executive Commit-
tee have created
their respective
Curriculum Com-
mittees. Personally, | feel every stu-
dent should be actively concerned with
whatever issues are discussed by either
the faculty or the student committee.
Since I also realize how impossible
active participation on the part of
every student is (both because of the
numbers involved and apathy), | wish
to offer the first in a series of re-
ports—continuing into next year—
which will hopefully keep the student
body abreast of the ideas and inova-
tions that might soon become a part
of the curriculum.

First of all, I should like to em-
phasize that the main goal of the
Student Curriculum Committee is to
offer suggestions which will improve
the quality of Washington and Lee
as an educational institution, We are
not a mere grievance commitiee. 1
don't feel it within our prerogative to
offer criticism of, say, individual pro-
| fessors. While poor teaching may be
inexcusable, that problem is best dealt
with inside the various departments,
| can only say that the ill-feeling
bred by a pronouncement of our com-
mittee against any single professor
would serve merely to discredit any
other suggestions that might be offer-
ed

Probably the mere fact that a mis-
conception of our function such as
the above exists at all would suggest
there has been a complete lag in
communication between the students
and the Curriculum Commitiee. Hope-
fully, this lag can be partially re
medied by these articles. Going a

 

Swede Henberg

 

Vanguard of change

step further, however, | would like to
urge that any student who has an
idea which he feels is constructive to
our aims either talk to me personally
or to a member of the committee.
While we have already done extensive
brain-storming, there may well be
certain areas we have overlooked. Any
legitimate proposal deserves consid-
eration, and therefore | would sin-
cerely appreciate suggestions of all
sorts,

As concerns specific areas now
under study, the first of these falls
under the general heading of dis-
tribution requirements. The  over-
| whelming consensus of this year's
; committee calls for a general lib-
eralization of current requirements.
This goal might be accomplished by
allowing students greater freedom
with the present categories, For
instance instead of having to take
six hours of philosophy, a student
might be allowed to take three hours
of philosophy and three hours of
religion, At least in the upper class
levels there are courses which lend
themselves to one semester's presenta-
tion, and there seems to be no reason
why students should be required to
take six hours of non-linked courses
in one department jusi to fulfill a
distribution requirement.

Along similar lines, this argument
might well be applied to freshman
sciences as well as to later distribu.
tion such as economics or fine arts.
As an example a student might be
allowed to take geology first semester
and biology second semester. This
would necessitate teaching introduct-
ory biology both semesiers, but that
does not seem like an insurmountable
barrier to such a program,

Another unaniamous suggestion
made by this year’s committee is to
encourage departments to offer more
comprehensive examinations to enter-
ing freshman, which might relieve
them entirely of certain requirements,
For instance, if a student passes the
math examination offered by the
school, he must now take Math 11
Instead he might be relieved of three
hours of math distribution require-

collected there would have been no

@ Yes, we did reject membership in
V.A.S.G, at first and decided to join
later. This was because we (wisely,
we felt) waited to find out more about
the organization before “leaping in.”
It is true that I only informed Mr.
Passavant about the V.A.S.G. con-
ference two days before it was to
take place. What “N.S.K.” didn’t
mention was that I informed him of
it less than five minutes after 1 my-
self was informed of it.
@ We also voted to send the fresh-
men a pamphlet on the Honor System
over the summer in order to make
them more knoledgeable about it.

“N.S.K.,” however, feels we have
not done this yet. This is untrue. The
motion passed on April 9, 1968, and
the pamphlets are to be sent this
month with a letter from next year's
President.

Fraternities face dectsion
on future Negro members

The significance of the above situa-
tions at Washington and Lee is easily
evident. Drawing a good number of
its student body from areas of tradi-
tional racial division, the University
community includes many with acute
sensitivity to the Negro issue. Also,
the fraternity system here has for
the past couple of years been under
careful scrutiny by the faculty and
administration, a few constructive
changes having already been sug-
gested.

Such university concern must be
expected with a fraternity system in-
cluding consistently 80 per cent of
the student body. The fraternity sys-
tem is a half of the overall Uni-
versity community.

Washington and Lee has been
slow to perceive the enormous im-
port of the question. The issue is
whether an individual, no matter what
his skin color or other physical char-
acteristics, will be accorded all the
rights and privileges of a human being.

It is unfortunate to even live in a
generation where such an issue is
doubted, but it is unquestionably pres-
ent. Of course, progress has been
made; but any conviction today, short
of full acceptance of Negro equality
in all things, is dangerously volatile
and nearly unaccepatble.

Fraternities, | believe, are one of
the most beneficial Opportunities in
college life. However, if they do not
accept and reflect the truths and
knowledge of the times, then they
cannot expect to exist,

The fraternity system is especially
open to reaction on account of its
black-ball system. I mention this not
to discredit the ball system, but only
to emphasize the necessity, the ex-
treme importance of an open-minded
approach to rush next year,

The black-ball is indeed a worthy
privilege, but one which subsequently
puts responsibility on every person in
a house. In the hands of every fra-
ternity member is the future of the
fraternity system and of our Uni-
versity. Discrimination could, with-
out extending the imagination too
much, bring repercussions from the
federal government, the faculty and
administration, and possibly — civil-
rights workers around the country,

nt will be very easy for many fra-
ternities to say: “We think that
Negroes should and must be accepted
and that all fraternities will inevitably
do so; but I don't think he could
ever get into our house now. I'm
sure there are a few other houses
that will take a Negro.”

It is true that the fraternity sys-
tem could get by if this, in fact,
does happen. But what if every fra-
ternmily is saying this? What if a few
fraternities would accept a Negro, but
the Negroes who come through rush
aren't the type of persons for these
particular houses? What if a Negro
doesn't get in a house next year?

Fhe Negro issue is very sensitive to
most minds, For this reason, | am
very concerned about the approach
which most people have taken here
at Washington and Lee about a very
serious matter, One cannot expect a
fraternity member to return for rush
next year and make a rational de-
cision on such an inflammable ques-
tion without previous and lengthy
thought and discussion,

1 urge all fraternity presidents and
officers to present this issue to their
houses, and talk it out, I leave you
with your conscience and a sense of
responsibility,

ments and be allowed to take only
Math 72 his second semester,

Also concerning math, the commit-
tee further feels that the option off-
ered either to take math or an ancient
language is, to say the least, the
stipulation that the math department
offer a wider variety of courses to
freshmen. I, for one, feel that cal-
culus should not be the only alterna-
tive open to first semester freshmen
who have to take math.

Perhaps the proposal that has pro-
voked the most debate to date is one
suggesting that normal class load be
reduced from five classes a semester
to four a semester. The committee’s
vote reflects this difference of opinion:
four members were against the pro-
posal and three were in favor of
it. Briefly, the argument for fewer
classes is, of course, that students
would be able to examine their sub-
jects in greater depth through a beef-
ed-up program of only four couses
a semester. Against the plan, how-
ever, is mainly the argument that
students would be limited in the dis-
tribtuion of courses they would be
able to take.

There is a contingency that was not
considered by the committee in voting
on the above proposal. If the uni-
versity were to shift its calendar
from its present two semester form
to a program that offered two semest-
ers of twelve weeks and one semester
of six weeks, the four-class load would
indeed be advisable. A student would
be required to take four classes each
of the first two semesters and only
two the final, shorter semester. The)
advantage of such a university calen-
dar is that exams would be finished
before Christmas and before spring
vacation the first two semesters. Next

 

year this proposal will be studied in
greater depth.

Although I don't have space to|
discuss them here, other topics were |
discussed such as the present advisor |
system, and the independent major and |
the possibility of freshman seminars. |
lt was decided, for instance, that a/
single advisor should be named to |
handle independent majors in order |

Committee

to eliminate some of the present con-
fusion concerning the program.
Concerning plans for next year, |
plan this summer to write a compre-
hensive survey of what I consider to
be necessary curriculum changes. This
report will be ready for the commit-
tee’s consideration early next fall,
enabling us, I hope, to begin on a
positive note. We will also continue
on a limited scale the type of survey
undertaken this year of the political
science department. At the very least,
this survey will entail class informa-
tion in addition to that offered by the
catalogue. From such information a
student will be able to find out how
many tests and papers are assigned
in a course and what the past year’s
format was (i.e.,
sion). Finally, the committee will
initiate a system of student advisors—

lecture or discus-|

 

one in each department, in order to
provide a broader base of student)
opinion and suggestions.

In my view, next year will be
crucial for matters concerning the
curriculum. Hopefully, the ‘pass-fail
system will be expanded and the
faculty will vote on a plan to eli-
minate Saturday classes. Such initia-
tive may well set a trend for other
changes, but unless the proposals are
both definitive and workable, all
momentum might be lost. I envision,
therefore, that the Student Curriculum
Committee can be most effective as
an organ of expression which, through
the faculty committee, offers not only
new ideas but also a solid indication
of student opinion,

@ Submitted a resolution to the
faculty urging a revision of the exam
schedule. This was acted on by the
faculty. Although they did not accept
our plan itself, we were told that
our views and reasons for change
were helpful in founding the plan
accepted,

@ Made much needed clarifications
of Honor System procedures con-
cerning pledged work and looking in
notes and books during tests.

@ We were instrumental in discourag-
ing the Adeministraion from making
mandatory checks of student part-
ments,

@ Rewrote the Mock Honor Trial
and presented it to the freshmen.

@ Checked to make sure that Satur-

@ Gave funds to the Rugby Club,

@ Held a meeting to talk with Presi-
dent Huntley and find out his views
on student life.

@ Checked up on what had been

and acted accordingly where things
had not been done.

@ The Committee was instrumental
in establishing the right of the Stu-
dent Control Committee to hear any
cases dealing with drugs on campus.
This prevents any such cases from
being handled solely by faculty mem-
bers and the administration.

There are some twenty-nine more
things that have been done by the
E.C. this year, other than “N.S.K.’s”
ten and the ten I have listed. | wish
that | had the space to enumerate
them.

At any rate, it is always easy for
an “uninformed... person” to sit on
the sidelines and criticize while others
try to get things done, I will not go
so far as to say that this year’s
E.C. did a great job. But it did do
more than any E.C, in the past four
years, The records will prove this.

No, we did not capture the head-

| lines by proposing such things as

required residency in dorms. But we
never were too much for that sort

“very serious” at-| of thing anyway.

In parting, this year’s E.C. accepts
uny just criticism by any competent
and informed writers, However, we
cannot help bui laugh al those who
blindly complain about something
they know little about, We wish neat
year's Committee good luck and hope

ments are in safe and clean condi-
tion?

The fiberboard construction is no
more a fire hazard than a_ similar
structure of wood and the buildings
pass all of the legal fire standards.
If a student notifies the school about
faulty or inadequate wiring, they
will send an electrician to correct the

problem, Old rags and junk can
be removed from the attics and
discarded.

As far as the complaints about
the apartments being difficult to keep
clean, our comment is that any
dwelling will become dirty and un-
sanitary if not cared for properly.
We rather think that the cleanliness
of an apartment is a reflection on
the occupants and not on the structure
of that apartment.

(2) What are
physical problems?

The thin walls do create a lack of
privacy, but we are all students and
we are all young and must expect
to endure certain conditions which
will end when our husbands finish
their studies and can provide “the
better things in life” for us.

As far as the rotting truss construc-
tion and holes in ceiling and walls
are concerned, we feel that this has
been exaggerated. Our apartment is
not perfect, but it is certainly not
in the described condition. Holes and
sagging ceilings can be fixed.

To call the heating “inadequate”
is perhaps the most ridiculous accusa-
tion. Through two winters we were
never once cold. At times it may
be somewhat inconvenient not to be
able to shut the bedroom doors be-
cause the heater is in the living
room, but as long as we are kept
warm—quite adequately warm—there
seems to be no room for gripes.

(3) Do you have any problems with
insects or rodents?

We have lived at Hillside for two
years, and in that time have seen
not one mouse, rat, roach, or other
“bug.” As far as the spiders are
concerned they are a nuisance which
unfortunately cannot be “sprayed
away” by the Orkin Man. He advised
us that the only way to control them
is to constantly mop down their
webs. They won't stay where their
homes are destroyed, and now I
very rarely find one in our apart-
ment,

The fleas come from students who
have dogs which are not kept clean
and which bring fleas (which nest)
school sent an exterminator who
in. Our apartment was jumping with
fleas before we moved in, but the
alleviated the problem. Since then we
have had not one flea in our apart-
ment, and we have a toy poodle
(who is bathed and brushed regularly.)

No insect or rodent is going to
stay whre it is not satisfied; if homes
are kept clean, problems will dis-
appear. The school is also happy to
send an exterminator for major prob-
lems.

(4) With help from the school and
a little work ourselves, we have had
no problems with our electrical or
gas facilities. Our apartment with
nine electrical outlets is better equip-
ped than many, but other apartments
could be fixed up so that the cir-
cuits are convenient, adequate, and
safe.

(5-6) The question of replacing Hill-
side Terrace is more complex than
perhaps many people realize. I's easy
to gripe about conditions and make
demands, but it's not always so easy
to find money for all of our desires.
To replace Hillside with nicer apart-
ments would involve a considerable
rise in rent—not the $10 or $15 which
the students would be willing to pay,
but a realistic $35 to $60 more per
month. New units cannot be con-
structed and operated for less. At
Duke, where we will continue our

the most blatant

studies, comparable apariments are

There will be a meeting of those

$110.00 per month with 12-month
leases and tenants are not allowed
to have washing machines. If the
students can afford this, fine.
Apartments of sturdier construction
and more conveniences are available

in town; the waiting list for Hillside, | -

occupants make of it. With its limita-
tions we would not give anything for
these two years here, and we are
grateful to W&L for providing Hill-
side Terrace.

however, grows each year. If there
weren't students who need Hillside
(with its low rent) the units would
not be completely filled and couples
would not be turned away to seek
higher-rent housing in town. Three
of the six couples in units 23 and 24
had to live in town before they could
be placed at Hillside—2 for a year
and 1 for a semester. They chose to
move to Hillside instead of remain-
ing at other locations.

Those students who want and can
afford better housing should live in
town, but others should not destroy
Hillside at the expense of those stu-
dents who need it. The apartments
are comfortable and spacious; Mr.
Brady and his maintenance crew could
not be more courteous, efficient, or
quick to make any repairs upon re-
quest; and Mr. Snyder and the ad-
ministration are understanding of our
financial problems and do the very
best they can to provide for us.
