Symphony Plans
Concert Pro gram
For November 1

Ihe Rockbridge Concert Theatre
Series will feature the National
Symphony, which has just returned
from a very successful European tour,
on November 1. The concert, which
is already a sellout, will be presented
in the VMI field house at 8:15 p.m.

On the afternoon of the concert,
the National Symphony will perform
gratis for the Rockbridge County pub-
lic schools. The afternoon concert will
afford those who do not have tickets
for the evening performance a chance
to hear the symphony.

Five Composers

The work of five different compos-
ers will be represented in the program.
Beethoven's “Egmont Overture” will
be the first number, followed by a
work of Purcell and Barbirolli en-
titled “Suite for Strings, Horns, Flutes,
and English Horn.” Barber's “Medeas’
Meditation and Dance of Vengeance”
and Copeland’s “Symphony No, 3”
will conclude the program.

There are two more programs
scheduled this year in the Rockbridge
Concert Theatre Series. Sometime this
winter, the Lywen String Quartet will
perform, and on April 8, the series
will feature Teresa Stich-Randall.

 

Lexington admired paintings in last Saturday's Rockbridge Outdoor Art
Festival. The festival took place in Courthouse Square.

 

 

Discussion of Vietnam Situation

Sunday night the University Fed-
eration of Christian Concern and the
Wesley Foundation presented at the
Wesley House Mr. John Fielder, an
instructor of philosophy at Washing-
ton and Lee, who spoke on “The
American Involvement in Vietnam.”

Mr. Fielder is chairman of the Lex
ington Committee on Vietnam, a local
anti-Vietnam war group, and in his
lecture he attempted to show that
United States policy in Vietnam is
both wrong and immoral

After presenting his case, Mr
Fielder opened the floor to questions
and was immediately overwhelmed
with a barrage of questions and re
buttals from the audience, which was
largely composed of V.M.1. cadets
The ensuing debate was very sprited,

DuPont Hall Exhibits
Feature New Painter

Abstract impressionistic paintings
by French artist Antoine Pentsch are
on exhibit in the duPont Art Gallery
for a month-long showing.

Pentsch, artist-in-residentnce _ this
semester at Mary-Baldwin College, is
a former student of Stanley William
Hayter, internationally known con-
temporary print-maker.

Born at the Royal Palace in Buda-
pest, Hungary, Pentsch has been a
resident of Paris since his family
moved there for political reasons
shortly after his birth.

Since the early 1950's, Pentsch has
been showing his paintings and prints
in the largest competitive art exhibits
in France, England, Canada, Ger-
many, Belgium, Sweden, Israel and

ithe United States.

Indication of New Trends

Marion Junkin, chairman of the
Department of Fine Arts, commented
that this showing of Pentsch’s work is
excellent as an indication of what
young artists in France, and the rest
of Europe as well, are doing today.
He pointed out that, while there is
a little influence evident in Pentsch’s
art of other artists of the School of
Paris such as Jean-Paul Riopelle and
Bernard Schultze, there is almost no
evident influence of American artists.
The European arists, like the European
car-manufacturers, said Dr. Junkin,
are more interested in becoming pro-
ficient in their particular style, and
developing that style, than in creating
an uproar by outdoing those before

Will Speak In Lee Chapel

Walter W. Heller has been sched-
uled to speak at Washington and Lee.
The University of Minnesota pro-
fessor of economics will speak in Lee
Chapel on November 10 at 12:05,

Heller is sponsored by the School
of Commerce and Administration and
will tentatively speak on “Prosperity,
Inflation, and the New Economics.”

Kennedy Advisor

The 52 year old economist received
his AB from Oberlin and his MA and
PhD from the University of Wiscon-
sin. He was appointed Chairman of
the Council of Economie Advisors in
1961 by President Kennedy. He served
in that office until the fall of 1964.

Time magazine described Heller as
“the most influential chairman in CEA
history and probably had the presi-
dential ear as exclusively as any other
single economist in U. S. history.”

Heller was born in Buffalo and
raised in Milwaukee. After being grad-
uated from the University of Wis-
consin, he worked during World War
Il in the Treasury Department. He
has also served as fiinancial advisor to
the U. §. Military Governor, Lucius
Clay, in occupied Germany.

Alters Economy

While he was Chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisors, Heller,
in effect, altered the economic direc-
tion of the country by winning first
Kennedy, then Johnson, over to the
philosophy of deficit spending as a

Committee Appointed

The 1967-68 Contact Committee
appoinimenis were approved by the

stimulant for a sluggish economy.

Heller was also successful in con-
vincing President Kennedy to support
a tax cut policy to guard the economy
against inflation.

lime magazine has also described
him as “the present-mined professor
who tempers earnestness with cordi-
ality and intellect with a touch of
ambitious worldliness.”

Cast Announced

For New Play
By Troubadours

The tentative cast for the up-com-
ing production of the Troubadours
was announced last week. The players
n “The Empire Builders” will be Nan
Duvall as the Mother, Page Dunn
as the maid, Katie Lyle as the
daughter, Zenobia, Noel Clinard as
the Schmurtz, Evan Jefferies as the
Neighbor, and Lawrence McConnell
as the Father.

Rehearsals began last Thursday
under the direction of Mr. Lee Kahn.
the play, which is to be performed
November 1-4, is a comic-tragedy
concerning a man's efforts to elude
the pain he finds in the world. In
doing so, he forces his family to flee
continually from the unknown by
moving from floor to floor within
their own house. At the close of the
play, the man comes face to face
with his reality of isolation, and finds
he has no inner strength with which
to face the adversities the world hurls
at him.

“This play.” said Mr. Kahn, “will
not be an easy one for the actors
lo perform.” This is only the second
time this play is being produced in
this country after being successfully
staged in Europe

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

... And professors who hand
them back on Parents’
Weekend are even worse.

Before we move into the coming Weekend (with a capital
“W’), there’s one matter we'd like to dispose of regarding
the past Weekend (also with a capital ““W”’). To wit, hour
quizzes.

A significant number of students had hour quizzes Staur-
day morning of Parents’ Weekend—and were forced to choose
between studying (requiring their parents to wander by them-
selves Friday night on their own) and accompanying their
parents (courting disaster on the next morning’s test).

Parents’ Weekend is, among other things, an intensive
public-relations vehicle for the University, directed towards
those who supply the lion’s share of the students’ financial
contribution to their education. Parents do not travel to Lex-
ington, Virginia, to watch their sons study for hour tests, nor
to see their sons take them. Parents’ Weekend is, in addition,
a time when parents are (hopefully) coerced into parting with
vast sums of money—to Contact, to the Mock Convention,
even to the Ring-tum Phi (but we didn’t schedule an hour
quiz). Parents’ Weekend was this year, and always has been,
scheduled far enough away from midterm so as not to conflict
with midterm tests. Parents’ Weekend is, all in all, a most in-
appropriate time to give hour tests.

Yet, in biology alone, 63 students had to take a quiz Satur-
day morning. And a biology hour quiz is not something one
avoids studying for. (We had a bit of trouble learning just
how many students do take Biology 1 and 101: the registrar
said finding out would entail counting names on enrollment
lists, and that would take too much time; subsequently, though,
we found the statistic at the University switchboard in a booklet
of enrollment figures for every W&L course—a booklet that
had been distributed by the registrar’s office.) There were other
courses in which students had hour tests Saturday, too—there
seem to have been at least as many hour quizzes on Saturday
of Parents’ Weekend as on any other Saturday in the year.

This took place at the same University where the faculty
not only refrains from giving tests on dance Weekends but
calls off classes altogether. We aren’t even—not now—arguing
against all Saturday quizzes. Just against the ones given when
the students and their University would be better off for avoid-
ing them.

Minister Renews Discussion

OnWGEL Drinking-Driving

that the age of 25 is considered the
leveling-off age for male maturity
of emotion and judgment. It is com-
mon knowledge that few if any Ameri-
can insurance companies will grant
auto insurance to male drivers under
age 25 for the same rate as drivers
over age 25. For most companies the
premium rate is double for the male
under age 25 as contrasted with the
cost to persons over age 25. Where

by THE REV. A. J, SCHRADER
Trinity Methodist Church

The week following this writer's
letter to the Lexington News-Gazette
Editor, on an objective approach to
the continuing problem and hazards
of drinking and driving among Wash-
ington and Lee University Students,
Joe Wilson, student editor of the Ring-
tum Phi gave a worthy, but not en-
tirely accurate, rebuttal to my article.

 

| wish to make a renewed attempt
to cover this vital subject; this time
in light of Mr. Wilson's rationaliza-
tions and counter arguments.

It might well be asked at this point:
what was the original motive behind
the writing of the article. | wrote it
with one purpose in mind—that of
preventing the needless loss of future
lives (be it students, townsmen, girls
here for dates, out-of-state travelers
or whatever other persons might be
victimized by accidents resulting from
students drinking and driving). Any-
time one life is lost as the result of
drinking and driving, the loss is tragic
beyond comprehension, Such a loss
cannot be rationalized or excused.

Avoided Statistics

In my article | purposely avoided
names and statistics to protect the
majority of students who are generally
and fully responsible in this personal
area of human behavior, Mr. Wil-
son's statistics dealt only with the
records of the Lexington Police De
partment as related to student driving
offenses: thus, they do not tell the
whole story. They do not tell of driv
ing offenses committed by drinking
students in Rockbridge, Botetourt,
Albemarle, Bedford and Campbell
Counties (adjoining area counties
through which students drive to and
from campus and off-campus socials

 

particularly those involving area girls
schools). They do not tell of acci
dents of students driving from Lex
ington to their homes at Various)
periods of time. And, Mr Wilson's
statistics do not tell of any number)
of “near accidents which were avoid

ed by one means of good fortune of

another in spite of drivers driving
under the influence of beverage alco

do the insurance companies get their
insights and criteria to determine this
leveling-off age figure? From past ex-
perience and regular consultation with
acknowledged psychologists.

University Responsibility

In his answer to my premise that}

the University has a responsibility to
help the students avoid the drinking
habits which could conceivably lead
to alcoholism, Mr, Wilson reached the
wrong conclusion, He is right when he
says there are no known “alcoholics”
(in the strict clinical meaning of the
term) among students at the Un-
versity, However, that is not what
this writer meant, Problem drinking
starts at the social level in the form
of so-called moderate drinking; and,
although you will seldom find a stu-
dent addicted to alcohol, in the ex-
treme sense, you can usually trace
most cases of alcoholism among col
lege graduates (later in their lives)
from the pre-college or college begin-
nines of moderate drinking which
eventually got out of hand.

This writer writes not so much as
an “Elizabethan,” as Mr. Wilson
infers, but as a 1967 realist; as a
former social chairman of the Epsilon
chapter of the Phi Kappa Tau fra-
ternity (national social) in Alliance,
Ohio: as one raised in a home where
both a grandfather and a father (God
rest their souls) were problem drink-
ers; as a former spasmotic drinker of
beverage alcohol; as one active if
Alcoholics Anonymous; as a chaplain
with the U. S. Navy in the Far East
for two years (where he buried several
fine young men who lost their lives in
accidents while under the influence of
alcohol); and, as the Lexington Rescue
Squad chaplain, where the occasional

“Third Time’s A Charm”

 

This the second of a two-part series
on past presidents of the University.
—Kditor,

The eighth president of the College
assumed leadership after the war.
The buildings had been sacked and
defaced by Union soldiers and the
library was despoiled. Only four pro-
fessors and forty students remained.
There had been no president since
Dr. Junkin resigned. The former
commander-in-chief of the Confed-
erate army, Robert Edward Lee, ac-
cepted appointment in August, 1865.
From the chaos of 1865 to his death
on October 20, 1870, a great univer-
sity had arisen.

fo honor his memory in 1871, the
name of the school was changed for
the last time: it was now Washington
and Lee University.

Son Succeeds Father

The head of the West Point Class
of 1854 and the son of the preceding
president became president for the
next quarter century. George Wash-
ington Custis Lee during the war was
aide-de-camp to President Jefferson
Davis. He was captured by the Union
at Sailor's Creek after he had engi-
neered the construction for the de-

 

Dr. William L. Wilson

fensive works around Richmond. In
1865 be became a professor of engi-
neering at Virginia Military Institute
and upon the death of his father be-
came president of Washington and
Lee. His administration ended in 1897
after a very hard struggle during the
stifling Reconstruction.

president in 1897, Willham L. Wilson
was born in Jefferson County, Va. and

Former Presidents Distinguished
In Several Different Endeavors

He enlisted in the Confederate Army |
and after the war taught at Colum- |
bia University. With the overthrow
of the test oath he became a lawyer
and a prominent figure in West Vir-
ginia Democratic politics. He became
president of West Virginia University
and resigned in 1882 to serve in the
U.S. House of Representatives. He
was chairman of the powerful Ways
and Means committee and engineered
the first progressive tariff bill. He
refused the presidency of the Univer-
sity of Missouri, became a regent of
the Smithsonian Institution, and in
1895 became Postmaster-General in
the Cleveland Administration. In 1892
he was president of the Democratic
National Convention. Upon the ex-
piration of his service in the Cabinet
he became the president of Washing-|
ton and Lee, serving until his death |
on October 17, 1900,

The youngest president of Washing- |
ton and Lee was George H. Denny |
who was only 30. Denny was born |
in Hanover County, Va., the son of!
a Presbyterian minister. He was grad-
uated from Hampden-Sydney and!
taught at several schools before re-
turning as a professor of Latin in!
1896. In 1899 he came to Washing-
ton and Lee to teach Latin and in)
1901 became president for a decade. |

Prominent Politician

There was extraordinary growth
as the student body increased from
200 to 630. He took an active part
in development of the Southern Asso-
ciation of Colleges and Prepartaory
Schools, of which he served as pres-
ident in 1905. This was accompanied
by the construction of many buildings
on campus. In 1912 he left for the

 

 

 

presidency of the University of Ala-
bama. He President and
Chancellor of the University until
his death in 1955. In 1946 he was)
acclaimed the “First Citizen” of Ala-!
bama.

Noted Scientist and Innovator

The noted scientist who took the
first x-ray photograph in the United
States became the next president of
the University. Henry Louis Smith
from Greensboro, N.C,, the son of
a Presbyterian minister, led from his
election to his retirement in 1929. He!
had been graduated from Davidson’
College and received his Ph.D. from
the University of Virginia. He be-!
came president of Davidson in 1901,
but left for Washington and Lee in
1912.

pulsory physical education program,

Shortened World War

Just as one Washington and Lee
president prolonged a war due to his
tactical knowledge, another shortened
a war with a new propaganda tactic.
The American War Between the States
and World War | were greatly in-
fluenced by two of our presidents.

Dr. Henry L. Smith

 

President Woodrow Wilson praised |
Dr. Smith for shortening World War |
One by several months. His idea for |
sending propaganda to Germany was |
so successful in undermining morale |
that riots broke out among the troops |
and the Kasier was forced to Mee}
the Reich. The pamphlets were put |
in self-deflating rubber balloons |
which could be dropped anywhere in|

| Germany. With the use of a gradu-

i
ated glass tube the gas escaped from |

the balloon as adjusted.

Francis Pendleton Gaines was born |
in Due West, S. ¢ and taught at!
Furman University, U. Va., and Wake
Forest College. In 1927 he became |
president of Wake Forest but left in|
1930 upon his election to the pres-|
idency of Washington and Lee. He!
led the University through the rough |
years of Depresison and war, and he}
up its academic reputation so|
that in 1956 a survey of educators |
chose Washington and Lee as one of |
the ten most distinguished men’s col-|
leges in the US.

Dr. Gaines retired in 1959 and be-|
came chancellor of the University un
tl his death in 1963

Letters to the Editor

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

An article appeared in last Friday's
issue Which was very misleading and
it would have been better if it had
never been reprinted. This was the
story about the student at Baylor who
died due to initiation hazing :

This article could have been taken
two ways that are relevant to Wash-
ington and Lee. Most people probably
read into it a subtle reference to the
“evil” fraternity system at WAL. But
it is equally possible to see that fra-
ternities are not the only organizations
which conduct hazing practices.

This was & “prestigious campus
organization” and the moral was that
even if fraternities don't exist, the haz-

| ING continues

Both lines of thought lead to the
moral that extreme hazing is danger-
ous, and everyone would agree with
this. But most readers at WAL would
come by the first line and see a
malicious cut at fraternities

This space could have been better
used with a story of local news which
couldn't be taken as slander. For
example, Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity
last Week conducted a very interest
ing symposium on relations between
WAL and VMI. Gen. Shell and act-
ing President Pusey were participants
as were other members of the facul-

ties
This outstanding example of local
public service did not appear any

where in the paper, but there was the
story about a hazing death at a uni-
versity two thousand miles away. The
anti-fraternity implications are obvi-
ous

| look forward to seeing more cov

erage of fraternity activities. Many
people outside the University have
acess Only to this paper for Wal

news and they should know the whole
truth

Respes ifully submitted,
Benny Grigsby

Actually neither team was very im-

WA&L’s fine halfback, Luke Crosland,
had several good runs early in the
game. In fact, it wasn’t until the second
quarter that either team appeared as
though it wanted this game in its
victory column. Fortunately for the

\| who ran the punt back to our visitor's
own four yard line. On the second
play, big Andy presented bigger Luke
with the ball as he shot past into the
six-point zone to the great embarrass-
ment of the Tiger’s left tackle and
guard. With Green converting to make
the score 10-0, everyone in the stands
made whoopee. Clearly, someone(s)
had now decided to play for keeps.

Happily, things continued to get
much worse for the Tigers as they
fumbled the ensuing kick-off and WAL
recovered on the 19 yard line. How-
ever, in spite of an understandably
disgusted H-SC defense, W&L, thanks
to a questionable series of calls and
a very poorly placed football, proved
unable to gain either a touchdown or
a field goal. And so the first half
ended with the Generals in the lead,
10-0,

Interceptions Galore
Aid Generals’ Defense

W&L was off-side on this pass theft),
Lawrence and finally Freret for his
third interception of the afternoon
left Coach Stokeley Fulton and his
squad scoreless, For the harder H-SC
pressed, the tougher our defensive line
under McJunkin and Wolf got. In
fact, the visiting eleven couldn't even
tally in the fourth quarter when, with
the benefit of two fifteen yard penal-
ties, their offense was rudely dis-
mantled by a McJunkin-Freret con-
spiracy which made it clear that our
end zone was going to remain virgin
territory all day.

The second half was truly a bril-
liant effort by W&L’s defensive team.
And so it was appropriate that they
scored the final points of the game
when they dumped the Tiger quarter-
back for a safety as the clock ran

 

out for H-SC.

After being outplayed in the first
half, the varsity soccer team rebound-
ed in the third and fourth quarters to
defeat Davis and Elkins College, 4-0,
on Friday before a Parents’ Day
crowd. The visitors controled the play
in the first half, and only by means
of a stout defense did the Generals
manage to hold D&E scoreless.

In the third quarter the Generals
offense began to work smoothly, and
the result was a 3-0 lead at the end
of that period. Jack Horowitz was the
offensive star for W&L, as he scored
two goals and assisted on the other
two, which were tallied by Co-captain

The highlight of the game came in
the third quarter when Horowitz
scored his second goal. His goal was
unusual because he scored it bare-
foot. A Davis and Elkins player had
neatly deprived Horowitz of his shoe
at midfield, but the W&L lineman con-
tinued his dribble and put the ball
past the D&E goalie from twenty
yards out.

With Friday's victory, the Generals
now stand 3-2 on the season, This Fri-

Last Saturday, before a rate cCa-)

riers stole places 1-8 from a con- |
siderably weaker Fairmont College.
Places, one, two, and three went to
Corbet Bryant, Harry Zeliff, and Bill

Generals allowed only 15 points to
Fairmont’s 50.

The opening meet of the season
was to be run with Richmond Sept.

in scheduling. The first meet was run!

| In a match played on the home course

places were taken by WAL. Those at

in novelty and leaving development
of any style by the wayside.

Dr. Junkin also commented that
Pentsch’s paintings, though abstract in
form, were developed from realistic
themes, such as a field or a shore-line.
He develops his themes to the point
where they become abstract. The
original themes are still obvious to
the eye.

Dr. Junkin intends to change the
art shows exhibited in the gallery once
a month. He hopes thus to demon-
strate trends in modern art while still
allowing the majority of those in-
terested in the field the time to browse
and examine the works on display. He
is trying to attract a wide range of
student interest by a wide range of
art styles.

EC Committees Observe
Progress For The Year

to help maintain quiet, and that this
project has been partially successful.
The Library Committee, Stack said,
would be more than glad to entertain
any suggestions from any student in
regard to the spending of the Chitwood
Fund or any other potential change
to make the library better.

Joe Matthews, a senior representa-
tive, outlined the problems involved
with subsidizing the Rugby Club, He
had talked with Dr. Hinton, chairman
of the University Athletic Committee,
about the possibility of that committee
funding the Rugby Club, but Dr.
Hinton replied that his committee did
not want the responsibility of the
Rugby Club,

Matthews said that the EC had
three potential avenues of action: It
could give the Rugby Club an out-
right grant this year on a one year
basis. The second alternative would be
to go through the Student Finance
Committee and obtain a portion of
the student activities fee. And the third
alternative would be to give them
nothing, and let them continue as
they have in the past.

Lexington Mumister Renews Drink-Driving Discussion

(Continued from page 2)

tragic results of drinking and driving
have been witnessed first hand.

Mr. Wilson's answers to five of
the six suggestions this writer made
to the University relative to this sub-
ject are far from accurate.

Manditory Lectures

Of my suggestion that the Univ-
ersity provide one manditory lecture
per semester on the hazards of stu-
dent drinking and driving, Mr. Wilson
states that the students “already under-
stand the seriousiness” of this prob-
lem. Even if this were fully true
that would be no justifiable reason for
an education institution to fail to
periodically re-emphasize the subject
to help keep the student alert to this
re-occuring problem.

Of my suggestion that the Uni-
versity provide more realistic super-

the Presidential Nomination” by Rob-
ert Potts, in which the increasing im-
portance of nominating conventions
is substantiated and discussed at
length.

Lewis H. LaRue, who teaches law
at W&L, is the only member of the
present faculty to have written an
Honors Thesis. Mr. LaRue wrote a
thesis in Political Science in 1959,

The number of Honors Students has
been increasing steadily since 1950.
In that year, two students submitted
theses, while 14 have registered for
Honors as of last week.

The merit of the various theses
could only be judged by those whose
knowledge of the subject is compar-
able to the students’. The Self-Study
report of last year makes it clear
that Honors Theses are of exceptional
quality: “The faculty appears to be
well staisfied with the present Honors
Program, and many Honors Theses
have been outstanding, in some in-
stances probably comparable to an
M.A. thesis.”

Honors Theses may be written in
the categories listed in the accompany-
ing box, as well as in economics,
Latin, mathematics, physics, religion,
modern humanities, and the inde-
pendent major.

 

vision over official social functions at
the fraternity level, Mr. Wilson
answers by saying that the house-
mothers and the students exercise
supervisory (behavioral) control over
all social functions at the fraternities.

This role of the housemothers is
exagerated by Mr. Wilson. However,
in fairness to the housemothers, pro-
priety calls for the avoiding of dis-
closure of the many problems and
limitations which many of the house-
mothers face at fraternity socials. Mr.
Wilson could be opening a “Pandora’s
box” if this point were carried to its
fullest conclusion.

Of my suggestion that the University
strengthen its existing regulations and
penalties rative to student drinking
and driving Mr. Wilson answers that
the drinking and driving regulations
(enforcement) comes under the re-
sponsibility of the local police and
“not in the realm of realistic Uni-
versity control.” There is only one
answer to this illogical statement;
namely: the preventing of needless loss
of human life comes under the realm
of responsibility of the University ad-
ministration and faculty, of the stu-
dents and the local law enforcement
agency. It must also be assumed that
the community at large shares in this
same responsibility.

Strengthen Regulations

In my suggestion that the students
be excluded from permission to
possess or own cars until their junior
year | was more conservative than
the writer of the editorial in the
Richmond paper (as quoted by the
News-Gazette) who suggested that the
senior year should be the “magic”
year. The College of William and
Mary goes even further by entirely
excluding the students from owning
or possessing automobiles.

Emotional Maturity

The real points, in this connection
are those centered around the emo-
tional maturity of the student in the
face of his age and the academic and
social pressures of life at the Uni-
versity. When you combine the “re-
leases” of drinking and driving the
student finds himself in a position of
grave danger to others and to him-
self.

Also, it is a well-known fact that
the average student (even those not
under scholarship or other aid) does
not come near to paying the actual

cost (to the University) of his educa-

 

 

tion. It becomes quite illogical that
a student should be able to “afford”
an automobile when he is not paying
the full cost of his education.

The fact, as Mr. Wilson states it,
that the girls “prefer and insist upon
riding in cars” does not preclude the
necessity that the University student
provide said cars, Such “insistence” at
such an early age in a girl’s life should
be fair warning to the male student
of even more formidible “insistences”
he can expect in the future, particul-
arly after marriage.

Intangible Statement

In my suggestion that the admini-
stration and faculty, at staff meetings,
should regularly deal with this subject,
particularly in times when the inci-
dents of student accidents are on the
rise, Mr. Wilson answers by saying
that when there is an increase in
accidents “someone at the school will
investigate.” That is a broad, in-
tangible statement. It is illogical to
avoid this subject as a “preventative”
approach and limit it only to times
following tragedies related to the
drinking-driving problem among stu-
dents. As University educators and ad-
ministrators are alert to the retarding
of their students’ academic well-being;
just so must they be alert to any
serious loss in student behavior well
being.

Any good law school knows that
American civil law is predicated on
moral law (which evolved from the

 

Mosaic law and American Constitu
tional law) and that changes in social
structures periodically call for new
or revised civil laws to cover chang-
ing problems or patterns of human
behavior. The same principles apply
to this specific subject under consid-
eration.

Irregardless of the conclusions
reached by Mr. Wilson, the student
body, the administration and faculty
of the University, | am grateful for
the fact that dialogue has been achiev-
ed by one’s humble efforts to deal
with this vital subject. If the Uni-
versity and the students become so
alerted to the need for action, and
thereby sustain periodic relevant act-
ion, and if just one life is spared as
a result, this effort will not have been
in vain. | personally thank Mr. Wilson
for honoring the subject by his article
and editorial.
