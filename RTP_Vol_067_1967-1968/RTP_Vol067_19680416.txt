LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, APRIL 16, 1968

Crenshaw, Passavant,
Petitions For Student

Eleven candidates for student body
offices emerged when the deadline for
the filing of petitions was reached
yesterday. The election for the “Big
Four” is planned for next Monday,
but primaries will be required for
two of the offices—the president of
the student body and Fancy Dress.

For Student Body President Herb
Crenshaw, SPE from Forest City,
N.C.; Jay Passavant, PiKA from
Beaver, Penn.; and Jeff Wexler from
Cedarhurst, N. Y., have been nomi-
nated. The primary is planned for
this Thursday. Students will vote for
these candidates and the two highest
vote-getters will face each other on
Monday.

Jeb Brown, Phi Gam from Po-
tomac, Md., is running against Danny
Leonard, a Phi Kap from Roswell,
N.M., for vice-president.

Student-body secretary is also a
two-man race with Mark Faverman,
ZBT from Norfolk, running against
Judson Simmons, a KA from Atlanta.

FD President

The post of Fancy Dress President
is being sought by four students who
are rising seniors, Carlisle Landreth,
a _Lambda Chi from Roanoke; Don Don

Pi Phi’s Win
Second Straight
IFC Greek Week

The Pi Phi's won for the second
straight year the Greek Week contest
sponsored by the IFC. Lambda Chi
finished second, four points behind
the Pi Phi’s. Third went to Sigma Nu
and fourth to Sigma Chi,

The first lecture was attended by
193 students while 171 appeared at
the second. Twelve houses participat-
ed in the relay, and two others started
but did not finish. In the community
clean-up, only five houses participated
with a total of 117 students partici-
pating.

Last year the Pi Phi's finished first,
while the Phi Ep’s were second and
the Beta’s were third. This year the
Phi Ep’s fell to seventh place while
the Beta’s held on to fifth place.

The relay event was won by SPE
with a smashing score of 18:23, edg-
ing out Sigma Nu by three seconds.
Third in the relay went to the Phi
Gam's.

 

Sharpe, a Phi Delt from Burlington,
N.C.; Dave Stovall, a PiKA from
Harrisonburg; and Alan Tomlin, a
Kappa Sig from Fort Worth, are the
candidates. These will also face a
primary on Thursday to determine
which two will enter the finals on
Monday.

Class elections are planned for later
on in the month for all of the class
officers and the EC positions. Dates
for applications for these positions

will be set after the “Big Four” race
is decided.
Speeches Tonight
Speeches are scheduled for the

candidates in Evans Dining Hall to-
night at 7 p.m. The candidates will
discuss the issues and answer ques-
tions from the students. The assembly
is open to all members of the student
body to enable them to meet the

 

 

candidates,

President Huntley Visits EC

Last night President Robert E. R.
Huntley visited the Executive Com-
mittee to answer questions from mem-
bers of the EC and to discuss ways
to foster closer relations between the
elements of the W&L community.

President Huntley also listed some
of the pressing needs of the Uni-
versity. He stated that the physical
needs were the most obvious, with
such often-discussed projects as a new
field house, renovation of Newcomb
Hall and the law school, construction
of a theatre and library expansion

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, April 16, 1968

 

A landmark, and how it was got

No more mid-semester grades (after the freshman year). It
almost goes without saying that it is a step of the first magnitude
towards regaining the proper emphasis of the faculty’s and
students’ respective (theoretical) goals: imparting and acquir-
ing educations. Especially in the minds of those of us who
last week had to explain away as many as three administrative
mid-term grades. We thank the faculty.

What is somehow disturbing to us, all the same, is that
it was the Hill that had to come up with the idea. Although
pure selflessness doesn’t fully explain the tenured teachers’
action, it does seem vaguely ironic that a student government
which once upon a time showed a little bit of interest in mid-
term grade reform had to be done one better by the faculty.

Me
Restoring lost confidence

 

Now comes the Tuesday Edition to comment upon the issuc |
of arbitrary grades. Because of the vacation, this is our first
opportunity to add our loud voice to that of the Friday Edition
in its request that some sort of grade-review mechanism be
established as quickly as possible.

The “crisis of confidence’? which in general precipitated
the present public discussion is, or was—so far as we can tell
very real and unexaggerated. Discontent exists, subtly, in a
number of places. And wherever it resides, it does this Uni-
versity no good when students have to explain a correctable-
but-uncorrected injustice; it does a decided disservice when stu-
dents, applying for graduate school or perhaps for jobs, don’t
have the opportunity to explain it—when it’s just there on
the transcript.

 

It’s easy to say, “do something.” It’s considerably more
difficult to specify, “do this.” (One thing it’s not at all difficult
to overrule is the weird suggestion to do away with the tensure
system.) At any rate, the faculty and administration are far,
far better equipped than we to determine the specific “this”
that ought to be done. One faculty member has even sug-
gested that whatever “this” is, it might be considered only a
sort of stopgap measure until grades are either done away with
altogether (not an unprecedented system among better col-
leges) or until grades-reports are fundamentally changed so
that they reflect what a student has accomplished rather than
emphasize what he has (in one teacher's view) failed to ac-
accomplish.

Whatever the solution is—and it would be better than
what we have: nothing—we can’t emphasize too strongly the
essentiality of discovering and implementing it without a day’s
needless delay. Normally it would be superficial to reiterate the
necessity of students’ having confidence in the professors who
grade them. A professor whose students are convinced he
makes a practice of giving blatantly unfair, arbitrary grades,
grades that simply do not resemble or reflect the level of stu-
dents’ accomplishments, is—at best—of utterly no use to the
purposes of Washington and Lee.

Committee Behind The Scenes
Considers Action For Changes

By LARRY HONIG

Washington and Lee's faculty is
the body directly responsible for
changes in the curriculum, such as
the recent addition of the pass/fail
option. But behind the scenes of most
such action is the prestigious—and
hard-working—Commitice on Cours-
es and Degrees.

Dean of the College and ex officio
Committee Chairman W. W. Pusey
submitted pass/fail to his colleagues
on the Committee last March at a
regular weekly meeting. Since that
time, the Committee has recommend-
ed, successfully, to the faculty the
change in examination schedules, the
abolishment of mid-term grade re-
ports above the fershman year, and
the expansion of courses in the
theatre.

But That's Not All...

These perhaps are the most dra-
matic of the Committee's duties. But
there are other equally important
questions put before Dean Pusey, ex
officio member and Dean of the Com-
School L. W. Adams, and

The change enacted two years ago

of the Committee's concern with
changes in major requirements.

Less frequently, the faculty or the
President may refer a special cur-
riculum matter to the Committee;
last month, an ad hoc committee be-
gan studying the feasibility of a five-
day school week.

The routine requests involve such
matters as a students’s wanting to
change his major after his junior year

 

As far as special requests are con-
cerned, the job of excepting students
from certain rules or interpreting those
rules falls to the Committee. Perhaps
the most frequent of such requests
come from seniors who wish to re-
duce their course load to 12 hours.
These are not often granted, but Dean
Pusey is quick to point out “we try,

often difficult duties, the Committee

disdained the “crummy choice of

and to the point. An independent for

calling for the nomination of Rocke-

Huntley Reviews
Plans For Gym
And Dormitories

Speaking of specifics in the Uni-
versity’s physical development pro-
gram, President Robert E. R. Huntley
tells students that a lot of plans are
a lot closer to completion than nearly
everybody had supposed.

In an address to a lecture audience
Thursday during Greek Week, and
subsequently in comments yesterday
to the Executive Committee and in
an interview with the Ring-tum Phi,
President Huntley said specific pro-
posals for a new field house, for
renovation of or an addition to Mc-
Cormick Library, for the same to
Newcomb and Tucker Halls, and for
improvements and additions to a host
of other facilities have all been sub-
mitted, are being discussed, and are
approaching the preliminary decision
stage.

Doremus Inadequate

About a new gym: “Nobody thinks
Doremus is adequate,” he said. Archi-
tect’s drawings (by Clark, Nexsen
and Owen of Lynchburg, who plan-
ned the new Student Union under
construction now) were made some
time ago; being discussed now is
whether these are sufficient for W&L’s
needs, wants and finances.

Meetings have been taking place
regularly and frequently among the
President, the University Development
Office (directed by Messrs. Frank Par-
sons and Farris Hotchkiss), and the
coaches to determine just what func-
tional needs ought to be met by the
new gym: how much indoor athletic
area do we need, and how should it
be allocated. It's not a question of
whether to build or not, Mr. Huntley
says, but rather exactly what it is
that needs to be built to best serve
the University. And the day of de-
cision is not at all in the far-off
future, when a specific proposal will
be made to the Trustees, when fund-
raising can begin and, ultimately, con-
struction will start.

Not So Simple

Even with a gym, though, it's not
as simple as how many handball
courts do we need. We don't need as
much indoor space as, say, Dartmouth,
but don’t we need more than, say,
Tampa? How do we go about re-
constructing the fields (this does have
to be done)? Artificial turf? There's
serious talk of it. The ideas are all
there. And they're being sifted. The
answers are in sight.

The same process, Mr. Huntley told
the Ring-tum Phi, is concurrently be-
ing followed regarding the library (a
new wing is being contemplated;
space-allocation insufficiencies are ob-
vious and are being considered; but
the problem is complicated by the
comparatively inflexible construction
of McCormick as it is now);

It’s being followed about the Com-
merce School (can Newcomb be add-
ed on to without making the front
campus intolerably ugly? can it be
restructured from the inside’);

It's being followed about a little
theatre, which “hopefully can be given
about the same priority as a gym”
(could Doremus be converted into
something along this line when it's
the phys ed people? is

Ruggers Will Host Tournament

By STEVE MASON

Last year a new organization came
into being at Washington and Lee—
the Rugby Club. People read articles
about it and commented that it was
nice but no one seemed interested
enough to come to a match or help
a group of dedicated “ruggers” gain
the backing that was necessary to field
a team.

The players themselves have knock-
ed on doors of the local towns people
simply because the W&L community
won't support them. Recently the IFC
took a step in the right direction by
sponsoring the upcoming Invitational
Rugby Tournament to take place here
this coming weekend.

Rugby is an interesting game to
watch, with the speed of basketball
and the contact of football; its a
shame that it can’t receive the back-
ing of either the P.E. department
or the E.C, One of the present E.C.
members had the following plank in
his platform: “The newly formed
rugby team has obviously proved suc-
cessful and has well represented W&L
at many different schools. Certain
small conditions will have to be met,
but the rugby team can add a great
deal of spirit to W&L.” For some
reason or anther the E.C. has not
given its support to the Rugby Club,

The Rugby Club has a schedule
that would make any coach in the
gym green with envy. Included are
such teams as U.N.C., Duke (who is
also participating in the tournament),
U.Va., N.C. State, Princeton, and
other nationally known _ schools.
Needless to say, exposure such as
this is one of the most beneficial
means of enhancing our reputation
and getting our name into the sports
pages of national newspapers, How
often does the football team receive
mention in the Washington Post with
such opponents as Bridgewater? Foot-
ball at W&L has been an economically
unsound venture since it was de-em-
phasized.

Rugby, on the other hand, has none
of the great expense of football, yet
does more to help W&L. Some of
the difficulties the Rugby Club has
had are some what out keeping with
the service they are doing to the
University community. For example,
when they are lucky they are allowed
to play on the I.M. field.

Aside from being too small, the
ground is so hard that hardly a game

 

 

attributable to it. Wilson Field is
the only suitable area but the Club
is denied its use.

At U.Va. Rugby has reached a
point where it overshadows football.
reams from all over the eastern sea-
board gather there to play. U.Va.
has achieved a status that we too
could achieve if only we had the re-
sources. With a budget of $2,000 we
could operate on an equal basis with
U.Va. This proposal warrants serious
consideration from everyone, from the
E.C, to the Board of Trustees.

The tournament this weekend will
include three other teams besides our
own club, Duke, Lynchburg, and a
third team as yet unnamed. Four
trophies have been purchased at a
cost of $120 and will be awarded to
the victors. They are “Dublin Cups,”
a sort of eight-sided bowl which is
quite in keeping with the European

arte tie ee

will be on Saturday, about an hour
before the lacrosse game; the second
match will follow the lacrosse. On
Sunday at 2 p.m. the finals will take
place. A rugby match is shorter than
