“The way

I see it’
By JODY KLINE

Student Body Secretary
(Editor’s note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
faculty concerning any topic, The
opinions expressed in this column
do not necesarily represent those
of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi.)

I am quite happy to accomodate
The Ring-tum Phi and comment on
a letter that appeared in last Friday's
edition by Mr. Leslie Smith, an inter-
mediate law student.

1 found it the best expressed argu-

ment for social
change (in any
area) that The

Ring-tum Phi has
featured this year.
Framing his points

in the’ reference
field of  integra-
tion and Negro

problems, Mr.
Smith presented a
cogent argument
for increased social
awareness on this
campus. Although I found many of
his interesting points valid, unfortun-
ately 1 discovered some that I feel
I must take issue with.

1 disagree with Mr. Smith that
this is a center of Southern pro-
vincialism. This writer is from the
North and feels that Washington and
Lee has to its credit a wide geographic
distribution within its student body.
With a cosmopolitan group come
varied backgrounds and ideas, The
South may provide us with our tradi-
tions, but I don't believe that it
marshalls our thinking.

Mr. Smith's solution to bringing
an end to our myopic thinking is to
diversify our student body. My opin-
ion is that our student body is

Administration has moved to allow
admittance of people from various
economic backgrounds by tripling fi-
nancial aid in the past five years.

not be evident—but it is present.
Therefore Mr. Smith's criticism is
misplaced: the comments by himself

developing more opportunities to ex-
press that diversification,

Greenia wins new Academy
of American Poets Award

Steven Greenia has recently won
the Academy of American Poets
National Award. Greenia, a senior
from Charlotte, won the $100 prize
for his entry of three poems: “Ar-
rival,” “One and the Other,” and
“For Theodore Roethke.”

The Academy of American Poets
selects various colleges and universi-
ties to administer the award. This is
the first year that W&L has been
chosen to administer the award which
will run for the next four years. The
panel of judges were Dabney Stuart,
James Boatwright, and Dale Rich-
ardson.

Greenia, an English major, has
twice won the Mahan awards for
prose, and this is his first significant
accomplishment in poetry.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

= The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi 2

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, April 30, 1968

Transition

Beginning with this issue, the Tuesday Edi-
tion’s Editor-in-Chief-Elect, Larry Honig, as-
sumes the directorship of this newspaper.
Several changes he has decided upon are be-
ing implemented in today’s Ring-tum Phi (viz
“The way I see it’).

Although the 1967-1968 Editor-in-Chief
retains full responsibility for his paper
through Commencement Day, it is in keep-
ing with long-standing tradition that the pro-
prietorship be turned over to his successor as
soon as the Publications Board elects one. We
are very, very happy to be able to “retire’’
and yet know that this newspaper could be in
no more capable hands than Mr. Honig’s. For
the information of our readership, the 1967-
1968 Editor intends to make occasional—
probably continual—use, for the rest of this
year, of the editorial column, on a “sharing”
basis with the Editor-Elect. (The latter, inci-
dentally, has chosen to distinguish his edi-
torials from ours by the use of his initials.)
Other than that, the Tuesday Edition is
securely his, from this day on.

The road to hell
could be paved with
VASG’s good intentions

The Executive Committee last evening passed
a resolution affiliating Washington and Lee
with the Virginia Association of Student Gov-
ernments. This same EC rightly rejected such
membership December 4, by a seven-to-one
vote—but saw fit to reverse itself now after
being assured by Tas Schulz, the president of
the VASG, that while there is not a single
limitation on the VASG’s powers in_ its
constitution, everything will probably be all
right anyway because the group means well.

b | hg
Could it be?

Last week’s letter on the bulletin boards,
signed by five members of the EC, wasn’t
intended this way—but it struck us neverthe-
less as approaching a streamlined, one-party
version of the old, dead (or domant?) two-
party Clique system.

Lg

A non-rhetorical reply

“Who but a Troub,” the Friday Editor asks,
“really knows what he’s talking about when
he repeats that the theatre is inadequate?”
Just for the record, we should be glad to tell
(1) who, and (2) how they can do it.

Firstly: there is an astonishingly large
number of non-Troub people who really do
know—precisely and with certainty—just
what they are talking about when they speak
of the “theatre’s” inadequacy. Secondly: these
people can, and do, arrive at that value judg-
ment (and others like it) through normal
processes of thoughtful observation, followed
by thoughtful articulation. It is really quite
simple, and most people do it quite well, quite
often and quite legitimately. Here are two
basic stipulations: all one has to do is recognize
that pure armchair philosophizing upon a
purely abstract “aridity / thoughtfulness” con-
tinuum fails to encompass the whole story; and
that, similarly, not even caring to try to de-
velop one’s capacity for perception beyond
a petty, purely semantic “cliche /non-cliche”
frame of reference has equally little perti-
nence.

We are not, even for a moment, trying
to twist the words of the Friday Editor and
charge him with claiming the Troub Theatre
is adequate. We don’t suppose at all that it
was his intent to contradict the substance of
this Edition’s three or four editorials about
the theatre-building (and “inadequate” is a
far-too-inadequate word with which to sum
up our attitude cowards that disgusting anti-
thesis of what a theatre-building should be).
And we realize, and agree with, the context
in which the Troub statement was made. What
we are commenting upon is only this un-

fortunate choice of an exempli gratia. Our
purpose now is simply to ask this: before
seizing upon how we say something, listen to
what it is we’re saying.

2

P.S.: And anyhow, the Tuesday Editor spent
two years working backstage at the “theatre”
as a member of the Troubs.

Miscellaneous observations

It has come to our attention, and has brought
with it a great deal of mirth, that our good
neighbor to the north—Virginia Military—
found grievous fault with the latest number
of the Southern Collegian. Some unimagi-
native barracks martinet even went around to
everybody requiring them to hand in the Col-
legians, for which appropriate recompense was
of course made. And all because of the article
by an anonymous “former rat” about certain
practices of the Institute regarding its fresh-

men.
2>

We've discussed, from time to time this year,
the nature of some of the junk mail we re-
ceive. Well, last week was enough to astound
even the most stouthearted. Vista, which usu-
ally limits itself to about six or eight manila
envelopes full every week, went all the way
and sent us two 40-pound packing crates of
“Vista Voice” newsletters. All of them under
the frank, of course. (But then, as Professor
Dickens pointed out earlier this year, what’s
the difference if we pay for a frank or if we
pay for a thousand little slips of perforated
paper for them to use on this unsolicited

trash?)
Ye
Capable of honor

The avant-garde thing to say these days is
that Washington and Lee’s integration is
“token,” but those who bemoan the situation
have cleverly neglected to supply a definition.
If token simply deals with numbers, then yes,
we have token integration. But if token implies
a state of mind, the silent pursuit of a self.
congratulatory mean of hypocrisy as far as
admissions are concerned, then no, we have
much more than token integration. There is a
shade of difference here which in years to
come will test our mettle far more conscienti-
ously than have the policy decisions of the
Office of Admissions.

For two years, applicants have not been
asked to give either a picture or their religion,
and as has always been the case, requests for
financial aid are considered separately from
applications for admission. Any student who is
admitted and has a genuine need for funds
will be given whatever amount is necessary
for him to matriculate. This University is
represented at all college nights for which
there is time, including those high schools
where the majority of students are Negro.
Since 1965, Washington and Lee has been
actively recruiting applicants from the Up-
ward Bound Program, which offers two
summer sessions of college study to high
school students living in economically or cul-
turally deprived areas. W&L is truly avail-
able to all high school students of sufficient
intelligence.

If, then, our integration is token, the fault
lies outside the realm of recruitment, admis-
sion, and finance. The Office of Admissions
"an assure a prospective applicant—and rightly
so we think—that awkward, hostile, or patro-
nizing situations on the Hill will be almost non-
existant. But when classes are over, the situa-
tion changes and exclusion may become a
fact. If this is the case, can Dean Farrar
honestly say to all applicants that Washington
and Lee will allow them to be everywhere
assimilated? He sincerely, and quite optimisti-
cally, believes we are in a position to so
promise -which is the basis for our open
policy on admissions.

The ultimate decision on integration is
the students’ to make, in each facet of student
life: campus organizations, positions of re-
sponsibility, social situations, and fraternity

membership. The University will await our|

response.

 

Republicans may have better chance
for victory with Nelson Rockefeller

By KIRK REID MANNING

The Republican Party must present-
ly be concerned with the overriding
issue of winning in November. How-
ever if it is to win, it must select
the ticket which will have the best
chance of success.

Richard Nixon is the front runner
for the nomination and is the favorite
in the polls, But, is this the man that
will win in November? Before decid-
ing we should consider several facts,

(1) Nixon has not won an elective
office by himself for 18 years and
is a potential no-win candidate once
again in November.

(2) Nixon’s ability to perform as
a capable executive is unproven

 

In the past 16 years he has had
limited authority and his role as a
decision maker has been severely re-
stricted.

(3) Nixon has been known at times
to become angry and frustrated when
he is provoked. This happened in his
1962 gubernatorial race. If this re-
occurs, it might result in the aliena-
tion of many of Nixon's supporters
and would-be admirers.

After considering these facts, the
answer to the question of Nixon’s
ability to win in November is aca-
demic, The question now is whether
or not the Republican Party can
afford to put its hopes and resources
behind a man who is a no-win candi-
date by definition and who could con-

 

 

EDMUND D. CAMPBELL, distinguished graduate in the class of 1918,

reminisces about post-war years.

Former editor and EC member

Alumnus recalls days at W&L

By ROBERT YEVICH

Student life at W&L has not chang-
ed as much as one might think over
the years. Last weekend Edmund D.
Campbell, returning for the fiftieth
reunion of the class of 1918, remi-
nisced about some of the memories
of his life at W&L.

The Lyric Theatre at that time had
the bad habit of showing second rate
flicks at double the normal price.
Under Campbell's guidance The Ring-
tum Phi sponsored and organized a
strike against the Lyric. After a few
days of successful student boycotting
Issac Wineburg, proprietor of © the
Lyric, capitulated and rescinded his
price increases. He also agreed to
show more Grade A movies.

Since the United States was at war
in 1918, many students volunteered
for the Student Army Training Corps.
The corps drilled every day on the
front lawn of the campus. But, ac-
cording to Campbell, the corps was
“trained with much chagrin by VMI
first classmen.” This chagrin was
probably aggravated by another inci-
dent which occured during Campbell's
career here. This has come to be
known as the Great Squeedunk Inci-
dent.

Painted Columns

Campbell told how surprised he
was to come to class one morning
about 8:45 and see the VMI colors
painted on the columns of Wash-
ington Hall, Being a member of the
executive committee, he went with
the EC to the VMI superintendent
who denied that any cadets took part
in the crime, But Campbell recalls
that far too many cadets were sus-
piciously looking out of their bar-
racks windows when the EC arrived
that morning. Suspicions at WAL were
even more aroused since someone had
pushed VMI “sacred cannon” down
a ravine only a few days before.

Campbell received another surprise
one other morning when he noticed
a buggy perched atop George Wash-
ington’s statue when he arrived for
morning classes. He said no one ever

did figure out who put the buggy up
there or how they got it there

The Ring-tum Phi only came out
once a week then, on Tuesday. It

was printed at the Rockbridge County
News print shop and the staff had
to sit beside the old linotypist and
proofread as he worked. Often the
paper lacked enough pictures since
the cuts had to be sent by mail to
Lynchburg

Campbell, a Washington lawyer,
comes from a family long associated
with WAL. He was born on campus
in Dr, Johnson's house since his

father, Henry D. Campbell, was Dean
of the College. His grandfather, pro-
fessor John L. Campbell, lived next
door to General Lee in what is now
Dr. Sensabaugh’s resktence

Campbell has in his possesion a
to his grandfather
The letter is & note

letter from Lee

«L.H. | of thanks from Lee for taking care

 

of his sick cow there. Campbell also
has a letter written to his grandfather
by Stonewall Jackson. Jackson, a VMI
professor, was teaching Sunday school
for colored slave children at the Pres-
byterian church. The letter asks Mr.
Campbell to teach one Sunday since
he had to go out of town.

ceivably lose the election by one emo-
tional angry outburst.

Governor Nelson Rockefeller is an
undeclared candidate for the nomina-
tion, Is he the man with the best
chance of success? The answer is not
pessimistic, Why?

(1) Rockefeller has a strong appeal
to not only the Republican voters but
also the large segment of indepenent
voters. His moderate-liberal philo-
sophy is well regarded by the general
electorate.

(2) Rockefeller has proved himself
to be an excellent administrator and
a decisive executive. Rockefeller’s
leadership has been instrumental in
making New York one of the most
progressive states in the Union. He
has championed legislation for educa-
tion, medical care, low income hous-
ing, law enforcement, job opportuni-
ties, highways, control of pollution
and mental health. He is nationally
known for his determined efforts in
securing the most extensive civil rights
and equal opportunity legislation in
the nation. It is significant that this
legislation has been while the state
debt has been reduced in each suc-
cessive year of the Rockefeller ad-
ministration.

(3) Rockefeller has been active in
State and local government for 34
years. His experience is evidenced by
his service to President Roosevelt,
Truman and Eisenhower. His duties
have included such distinguished posts
as Asst. Secretary of State, chairman
of the AID Advisory Committee,
chairman of the President's Advisory
Committee, Under Secretary of HEW
and Special Asst. to the President for
foreign Affairs.

Most voters have considered these
and other factors. We have pondered
the merits and disadvantages of many
candidates. I wish along with other
Republicans a winning ticket. My
choice is not conclusive, but, I think
that we would be foolish not to con-
sider the superb qualities of Nelson
Rockefeller. He is the one cadndidate
who is able to unite the Republican
Party and influence the independent
vote. Our hopes and expectations can
only be brought to bear upon our
nation with the nomination and elect-
ion of Governor Nelson Rockefeller,
The Presidency is ours and our partici-
pation is paramount.

I ndependent poll

(Editor's note: a poll was taken,
not by The Ring-tum Phi, in early
January of this year to discern
opinion concerning the newspaper's
non-editorial policies. Following are
some of the results.)

The “Independent Poll” was a sur-
vey of the entire faculty and ad-
ministration, 149 people, and approxi-
mately one-fifth of the student body,
260 people. 48 per cent of the faculty
returned the questionnaire, while stu-
dent participation was 65 per cent.

On the question, “How well do you
read The Ring-tum Phi?” $3 per cent
of the faculty answered “Read most
stories and the editorials,” to which
the students’ answer was 67 per cent.

“In which items are you most in-
terested?” (By percentages.)

The most heartening answer, from

The Ring-tum Phi —Tuesday

The Ring-tum Phi is
year. It is printed by the

 

the staff's point of view, was to the
question “Are you satisfied with The
Ring-tum Phi, generally speaking,
aside from its editorial policy?” (By
percentages.)

Faculty

64 Yes 28 No 8 na.
Students

71 Yes 28 No I na.

There were several additional ques-
tions, but since most are of peripheral
interest only a selected few are in-
cluded here. 86 per cent of the faculty
and 85 per cent of the students said
“yes” to covering and reporting
speeches or programs given by per-
sons invited to the campus after they
have taken place.

71 per cent of the students wanted
The Ring-tum Phi to publish a brief
weather report. The result of this
answer is that the Tuesday edition
will follow the Friday edition’s lead
in doing this. So is the case with the
University calendar, when there is
space, since 83 per cent of the faculty
wanted it, and 91 per cent of the
students preferred including it.

Anyone who would like to see a
very extensive breakdown of the re-
sponses to this poll or additional
results of the survey are invited to

Stickmen fall to Washington Col.

Last Saturday, in the rain and
cold, a small crowd watched the Gen-
erals’ Lacrosse team lose to Wash-
ington College. The Generals played
well but the stickmen from Wash-
ington proved to be their betters as
they won 14 to 8. This was the Gen-
erals’ fourth straight loss,

Washington College had two ex-
cellent attackmen which the Generals
had to stop if they hoped to win but
unfortunately the defense couldn’t

hold them as Reagen scored four
goals as did Madden. The offense
played very well, amassing their high-
est point total of the year. Chew
scored 3 goals, Pittman 2, Wich 1,
Carter 1, and Schenkel 1. The Gen-
erals were without the service of mid-
fielder and face-off man Jay Meri-
weather but Terry Griffin and Bob
Frost did an excelent job of filling in.

The difference might have been that
Washington capitalized on our mis-
takes as we failed to do on theirs.
Washington was well disciplined and
executed their offense and defense
with precision. The Generals didn’t
quit however, and kept battling, even
in the last few minutes when defeat
was certain.

The Generals meet Roanoke Col-
lege here this Thursday in what should
be a good contest. On the dark side
is that goalie Dave Johnson has a
journalism lab in Roanoke on Thurs-
day afternoon and may not be able
to participate. The rest of the season
includes Duke and our rivals from
Charlottesville, U.Va. Both teams are
good and the Generals will be look-
ing for all-out efforts from the squad
to try and salvage the season, Coach
Szlasa is optimistic about both the
remainder of this season and next
year as well. He cited Whit Morril

Glovemen end loss streak

 

The Generals finally snapped their
recent losing streak with a 9 to 6
win over R.P.I. last Friday afternoon. |
The day before dropped a pair of |
close ones to Old Dominion 3 to 0
and 3 to 1. The star of the R.P.1.
game was rightfielder, Charlie Freret |
who drove in five runs. The winning |
pitcher was Thom Mitchel who went!
the whole route.

Against ODC the Generals were |
winning one to nothing on a home
run by Jim Wilson when an error
allowed the winning runs to come
across the plate. In the second
the Generals couldn't seem to find)
the range at the plate. The losing |
pitchers were Bill Rasmussen and
John Botcheller.

The Generals journey to Bridge- |
water this afternoon in hopes of |
getting even for the trouncing they
took last time out against the Eagles. |

Rain dampens Classic

Neither rain nor hail nor freezing
cold nor Bud could deter the eighteen
intrepid tubers who sailed forth on
the Maury River Saturday in quest of
victory in the running of the Second
Anuual Goshen Classic.

In a chilly downpour and a river
running above expected depth and
below expected temperature, ingenuity
was the key word for all contestants.
Some donned life jackets, others crash
helmets, and still others, scuba-type
wetsuits. The spectators on the banks
thought they all should have donned
straight jackets, for, as one was quoted
as saying, “You gotta be crazy to
get in that river today.”

But it appears that the lure of a
College Town Shop-donated After
Six white dinner jacket was too much
to sway the contestants from the Call
of the Wet. And the Call was the
loudest for senior law student Wins-
ton Mathews, who, strapped in his
inner tube and wearing a full length
wetsuit, bright orange chest protector,
and crash helmet, chopped 36 seconds
off last years’ record pace and upset
defending champion Jim Batterson—
who, in the true Polar Bear Club
tradition, was clad in next to nothing.

Mathews’ time of 32:00 was phe-
nomenal, but even more astounding
was the way he negotiated the swift
Maury rapids. With his inner tube
strapped around his waist, he swam
through the pools and spun through
the rapids with his tube on edge,
like an inflatable wheel of fortune.
The technique did the trick, though,
as he defated defending champ Bat-
terson, who used the more conven-
tional tubing approach, by twenty-
three seconds.

Batterson did not go home empty
handed, though, as he and fellow
Gaines Society member Scott Tred-
well took the team title and the keg
of beer that went with it, defeating
the ZBT duo of Scot Brower and
Mark Horne by 3:06.

Of the eighteen tubers who started
the race, sixteen managed to float
across the finish line of the two-mile
course. The only two casualties were
Ken George, Sigma Nu sophomore,
who suffered leg cramps and dropped
out of the race; and SPE sophomore

Ed Suplee, whose tube exploded
within sight of the finish.
Although Classic Director Jerry

Perlman, in view of Saturday's miser-
able weather, termed the event a
“qualified success,” he did express
disappointment in the fact that he
had no contestants for either the
Powerpuff (girls) or the President's
Trophy Race (faculty and staff). The
latter was expected to be a battle
between Information Services Di-
rector John Hughes and Sports In-
formation Director Mickey Philipps,
but both dropped out of the race
when the rain caused their “rheuma-
tism” to act up.

Perlman, when asked if he planned
to hold the Classic again next year,
said, “If the weatherman will give
us a break, there will definitely be a
Third Annual affair, But after this
year, | wouldn't be surprised if the
polar icecap descends on Rockbridge
County next year at this time.”

procedure

(Continued from Page 1)
of the contested offices. The four
top EC candidates and the two top
candidates for the president and vice-
president will be in the Monday final
election. In this election each voter
will have two ballots for the EC, and
one each for the president and vice-

| president,

The freshman ballot box will be
in the quad, while the sophomore and
junior ballot boxes will be by Wash-
ington Hall. The polls will be open
from 8:25 a.m. until 2 p.m, The EC
decided that there would be no
speeches before the balloting. The
consensus of the EC was that these
were so poorly attended that they
were more of an encumbrance instead
of a help. This was also done with
the hope of increasing the voter
participation.

Curriculum report

In further action the EC listened
to a report from Swede Henberg, the
new chairman of the Curriculum
Committee. Henberg noted the close
cooperation that was developing be-
tween the faculty and the student
committees. He also stated that the
committee was investigating the pres-
ent system of faculty advisors and a
clarification of the independent ma-
jor.

The EC voted $40 to Jody Kline
and Steve Saunders to reimburse them
for their recent participation in the
Hollins Mock Security Council. This
is the third year that the EC has
supported a delegation.

Junior representative, Lee Halford,
reported on his work as head of a
subcommittee investigating the pro-
gress of the Self Study Report. He
said that most of the problems ulti-
mately stem from a lack of adequate
financial resources. With the advent
of the Office for University Develop-
ment and a new president this ob-
stacle should be soon overcome.

logy. He now holds the same posi-
tion at UNC. Dr. Dunn has also served
in an advisory capacity for the Pan-
American Petroleum Corporation.

Structural geology is Dr. Dunn's
major field of interest. Currently, he
is studying the structure and develop-
ment of folded mountain belts. His
primary area of study has been the
Piedmont and Appalachian region of
Virginia and North Carolina.

Although Dr. Dunn's lectures will
be technical and scientific in nature,
Dr. Edgar W. Spencer, head of the
Geology Department, has stated that
“anyone who is interested may at-
tend.”

(Continued from Page 1

and others for remaining silent on
further integration at W&L. I did so
not because I felt that it was im-
portant but because | believe that
to a large extent the issue had been
resolved. Personally, | have always
been impressed with the way Negroes
were assimilated into the Washington
and Lee routine. This I believe can
be credited partly to the fact that
Mr. Smith, himself a Negro, is not
: “black-clause buster” sponsored by
a Negro group but rather has a sin-
cere interest in getting a fine legal
education, But the student body can
be congratulated for, in some cases,
placing personal feelings behind what
the majority felt was right for Wash-
ington and Lee.

I am glad that further integration
is coming to WAL. But I feel that
it should come at a natural rate. With
personal pictures removed from the
application forms, discrimination now
would be difficult, therefore 1 believe
that the University undeniably stands
ready to accept any qualified Negro
But | do not feel that the Office
of Admissions should Bo out and

 

recruit a Negro simply to say that
we have them here. Mr. Smith must
agree with me that integration is not
determined by the numbers of Negroes
at WAL but by the degree to which
they are accepted in the daily routines
of this campus. Realistically, 1 must
agree with Mr. Smith that this has
not occurred totally yet. Nor will it
until a fundamental relationship is
established.

This campus will best accept the
Negro when they know him—when
they play sports with him, work with
him or study with him. This campus
will best understand the Negroes’
problems when they may talk with
one. Mr, Smith has waited almost
two years to speak. I feel that some
expression was due from him before
now.
