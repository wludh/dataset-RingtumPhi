Entitled “Approaches to Shake-
speare,” the symposium aims at re-
flecting the varying critical postures
of the participants as well as develop-
ing specifically Shakespearean ma-

here.

All sessions will take place in Lee
Chapel.

The symposium will officially open
at 8:15 p.m. Tuesday, February 13,
when the aims of the program will
be outlined by Dr. Severn P. C.

The chances for Nixon’s nomina-
tion rest largely on the results of the
forthcoming political primaries, the
first of which will take place in New
Hampshire this March, If he can win

Nixon stands a good chance of captur-

polls, Nixon is well ahead of Gov.

ent, in most of these states. According
to “Time,” Nixon is leading Romney
3 to 1 in New Hampshire. In Wis-
consin, likewise, he is ahead by ten
percent.

Although he might win the pri-
maries, Nixon’s nomination is by no
means certain. In a recent issue of
“Newsweek” Nixon is predicted to
have only 561 votes of the 667 needed
to win.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper

Tuesday, January 9, 1968

 

Dean Huntley

The pleasure of the Ring-tum Phi upon the nomination of
Robert Edward Royall Huntley as president of Washington
and Lee University is not easy to express. Rather than being
so presumptuous as to proclaim in these columns our assessment
of Dean Huntley’s potential as president of the University,
the Tuesday Edition is publishing today exerpts of remarks
he made to representatives of the Virginia press last week
shortly after the announcement of his election. One cannot
fail, we think, to be impressed and gratified, enormously.

 

Two Debts

We succumb, however, to the desire to comment on two re-
lated matters. Firstly, the Board of Trustees receives the thanks
and renewed respect of the Ring-tum Phi and, we think, of
everybody else for acting as quickly as it did and in the manner
it did, as well as for the particular choice it made. It is already
apparent that there will be no element of the University com-
munity that will be unable to work with Mr. Huntley with
the greatest effectiveness, in an atmosphere of understanding
and sincere amiability.

7 7 7 7 7 7

Secondly, the interim presidency of Dean William Webb
Pusey III must not be allowed to pass unnoticed and un-
thanked. In his first University appearance as acting president,
he said: “We will move ahead as best we can. It should be
realized, however, that common sense dictates that it will be
necessary to postpone some decisions until the new president
is appointed....His choices must not be unduly circum-
scribed by interim decisions.”

Moving ahead, and at the same time not unnecessarily
limiting the scope of Mr. Huntley’s choices, was to prove no
easy task. Yet Dean Pusey has been overwhelmingly success-
ful in fulfilling each of those pledges while not denying the
other. He worked long: lights often remained on in one or
the other of his offices when everybody else was long gone
home. His Thanksgiving and Christmas vacations were a great
deal shorter than those of the rest of the University commun-
ity. He made a point, too, of not disassociating himself from
the students and the faculty: he found time to talk with them
when he met them on the Colonnade or in the co-op or any-
where else, and to listen to people; he was at all times accessible
to all comers in either of his offices. He gave enormous
amounts of time helping the Ring-tum Phi, for example,
whenever we requested him to, even when we stepped out
of our proper bounds in asking. Even the fine touches were
superb, as when he attended the Trivia Contest as “Grand
Prize-Awarder” and produced his own finale to the program.
Mrs. Pusey, who has always been recognized as pre-eminent
in the art of gracious hostessing, was a magnificent first lady;

 

faculty, distinguished visitors and other University guests
came away from the Puseys’ social gatherings marvelling.

Dean Pusey has shirked nothing and yet has interloped
nowhere. For four months he has exercised the responsibilities
of the presidency, and the particular responsibilities of the
acting presidency, with the highest distinction, Washington
and Lee is grateful.

Dean Robert E. R. Huntley, in

The conference was _ tape-re-

Dean Huntley: I'd like to make one
comment before you ask questions. I
want to take this occasion to point
out how glad | am, and everybody
at Washington and that Dr.
Pusey has agreed to go on as dean
of the College, which is certainly the
first thing I needed to know before
accepting the election as president,
and a critical factor in the future of
the school. Of course we all owe him
a great debt of gratitude in stepping
into the breach during the last six
months.

Reporter: Dean Huntley, what do
you think is the growth potential of
Washington and Lee?

Huntley: | suppose

of years, there is almost no limit
to the size that it could become. I
don't anticipate that this will be
Washington and Lee's goal.

Reporter: Do you think it would be
good for Washington and Lee to
strive to become as large as it could?
Huntley: No, | do not.

Reporter: Can you see any threat to
small colleges in the developing com-
munity colleges?

Huntley: No, | don't see them as a
threat. | think that there will be a
need for some liaison between schools
like Washington and Lee and the
community colleges. | can't imagine
that the needs in the educational
world are so circumscribed that there
is not considerable room for both
kinds of institutions.

Reporter: Can you comment on the
apparent trend toward an increasing
demand for liberal arts education?
Huntley: | hope that you are correct
that there growing demand for
a liberal arts education in the coun-
try. Certainly Washington and
will continue to operate on the
sumption that you are correct that a
major need in higher education is for
emphasis on quality liberal arts edu
cation. This has been the dedication
of the school throughout, and will
continue to be. I don't think that the
“loose specialization” that occurs
through the law school and the
school of commerce inconsistent
with the continuing emphasis on liber-
al arts education. On the contrary,
the more or less unique relationship
between this “loose specialization”
and the continuing central emphasis
on liberal arts education are desirable
both to the liberal-arts people and
loose specialists

higher educational institution, with

tion in the lWheral arts, with student

bedy and faculty drawn from all
walks of life: and from acrom the
country, strongly motivated young

men who represent a crow-section of
society; and highly qualified faculty
members who are principally

terest in research and
scholarship important in their think-
ing, but secondary in motivation.
Reporter: Have you any notion

Huntley: No. The principal responsi-
bility for curricular innovation will
continue to be, as it has been, with
the faculty and the deans.

Reporter: One thing that was a ques-
tion a few years ago is the position
of the University on athletics. What
is your view?

n. E. R.

HUNTLEY

Huntley: The position of the school
in recent years on athletics is that it
constitutes and will continue to consti-
tute a major part of the liberal arts
program at Washington and Lee. |
believe that it strong program
which has had a few rocky years, |
hope that it has reached a maturing
now upon which it will be able to
build. We have recently named Coach
McLaughlin as the new athletic di-
rector for next year, and | think his
views are the same as those of the
institution in this kind of program.
I anticipate no change of direction in
the athletic program.

Reporter: | don't know about Wash-
ington and Lee, but more and more,
students throughout the country are
asking for a greater voice in admini-
stration. What do you think about
that? Is it true here?

is a

Huntley: | think it's true that they
more and more are asking for a
greater voice in the administration.
One point here is that for a long while,
students at Washington and Lee have
had a significant voice in nearly every
aspect of the operation of the school.
I think the legitimate demands which
the students have made for an addi-
tional voice in the affairs of the
school already are, to a large de-
reality Washington and
Lee. Student government has always
been in their hands, including the
Honor System and the administration
of student affairs

In addition, students participate on
some committees with faculty mem-
bers. Student views are solicited both
formally and informally on nearly all
matters which the school has to con-
front. The on matters of
major policy will continue to be made
by the Board and by the faculty. It
is also true that much more decision-
making has been entrusted to the
faculty here than in many other insti-
tutions, That, it seems to me, is quite
helpful, and there plan to
change that. though often it is time
consuming to the faculty

alumni about these matters, and I
think the consensus among alumni is,
in fact, not generally represented by
the comments you have suggested.
Certainly there have been some
changes in student dress habits, and
1 suppose that there will continue to
be such changes. I wish to make it
clear that I would prefer students
to dress in an appropriate fashion;
it adds a good deal to the atmosphere
of the school. But I would not antici-
pate that the faculty or Board would
wish to make any change in the
tradition here of allowing these mat-
ters to be determined within very
broad limits by the students them-
selves. My own observation is that
the students have shown a_ rather
large measure of responsibility in de-
ciding this for themselves. Dress
habits on campus, while they have
changed somewhat, seem to me to
be rather good. The speaking tradi-
tion is still more apparent by its
observance than by its breach. It may
be that it has slipped somewhat, but
by comparison with some other
campuses, I think Washington and Lee
measures up very well in both these
respects. I don’t think either of these
matters is thought of by the students,
the faculty, or the alumni, so far as
| am aware, as matters which are
critically important in themselves in
so far as they reflect the school’s
success in fostering a spirit of close
liaison between faculty and students
and among students. And so far as
they reflect that they are important.
As for the Honor System, in the
past years since I was a student, the
students have questioned the validity
of the system repeatedly, and they
will probably remain to do so. It
has survived this kind of questioning
with amazing vitality. | am confident
it is working very well with the high-
est student support and control.
Reporter: Is any plan or study being
made about independent study?
Huntley: There are no plans as yet
but there is much consideration as

the Committee on Courses and De-
grees has repeatedly conducted stud-
ies along these lines. What steps will
be taken in that direction I do not
subject of

know, but it is not a

which the Committee is unaware. The
faculty and student body have also
set up special committees to solely
study the curriculum, but I don't be
lieve they have a timetable for their
reports

Reporter: The question of
ties at Washington and Lee has been
up in the air now for quite some

on this matter?

the student body into small groups
which are not related to the academic
pursuits of the school. That, I sup-
pose, is the negative side. Whether
the advantage of fraternity life—social
and otherwise—can be preserved with-
out too much emphasis on the frag-
menting aspect is the major question,
It seems to me they probably can be,
Reporter: What do you feel is the
major purpose of the college president,
besides raising money?

Huntley: That is a very good question,
Raising money is a major function,
but for Washington and Lee it is
harder to answer than it would be
at some schools, and it is good that
it is hard to answer. The bylaws of
the University do entrust most of the
significant decisions, that is those re-
lated to the educational enterprise,
which are certainly the significant de-
cisions, to the faculty with the Board
in ultimate authority. The President
is thought of as acting as a leader of
the faculty, bringing up matters he
feels important, advising when he has
advice to give, stimulating and lead-
ing if necessary faculty committee
activity and maintaining proper liaison
between the faculty and the Board
and the students and the Board. That
is a nebulous task but it seems to
me to be an important one.
Reporter: Do you believe past fund-
raising has been successful, and is
there room for improvement?

Huntley: There is room for improve-
ment, but it has been successful.
Washington and Lee has never be-
come poverty-stricken and it is not
now. That statement would not be
true if fund-raising had not been suc-
cessful in the recent past and over the
long haul. The organization of these
efforts has taken nearly every pattern
you can imagine, depending on the
needs and the times. The president
certainly needs to take a position of
leadership in this area, and our presi-
dents always have, I don’t think Wash-
ington and Lee has ever considered
for a moment abdicating its decision
about its goals to any source of funds,
private or federal. I don't think it
has ever been called upon to do so.

B-ball Team Wins Ninth Straight;
RPI Win Brings Record To 11-1

While most of us were on our way
home for Christmas vacation, the bas-
ketball team was on its way to North
Carolina to continue on its winning
way. They rolled over North Carolina
Methodist 91-71 as Neer lead in
scoring with 20 points. Two days later
they took up where they left off,
beating N.C. Wesleyan 89-61; Cart-
wright led the scoring with 22. The
next night they took on U.N.C. at
Charlotte, the final score; W&L 85,
U.N.C. 65, Cartwright again led the
scorers with 22, With their record 8-1
they went home for a well deserved
rest,

Last week they returned to turn
back a short but scrappy Milligan
team 94-65 and won a re-match with
U.N.C. 91-60. Neer led the scorers
in both contests with 34 and 16
points respectively. Against Milligan
the Generals looked somewhat cold
as they didn’t play a very tight de-
fense in the first half and allowed
Milligan the lead for about the first
ten minutes. By the half the Gen-
erals manged a nine point lead and

in the second half they caught fire

 

and expanded their lead, The Gen-
eral’s big men did a fine job on
offense as Neer got 34, Wesselink 18,
Cartwright 17, and Fauber 9.

Saturday night saw the second
string playing a good portion of the
game as U.N.C. at Charlotte didn’t
provide very good competition. Char-
lie Stone turned in a good perform-
ance at guard collecting 10 points
and setting up some good plays to
the big men. Saturday night was the
General's eighteenth consecutive vic-
tory at home and boosted their sea-
son record to 10-1,

Last night the General’s downed
Richmond Professional Institute for
the second time this season by a score
of 64-46. Wesselink had 18 points
and Neer 16 to lead in the scoring
department.

The Generals have been playing
outstanding ball recently with their
average margin of victory around
twenty points. They are nationally
ranked in both team defense and field
goal percentage. The Generals’ big
men have been doing a fine job
underneath the basket and outside

versity of North Carolina, and West
Virginia University.

NOTICE
The home wrestling match previ-
ously scheduled for January 19 has
been changed. The Generals will
entertain the Indians on January 12.

Norwood Morrison, Jody Kline and
John Carrere have been working the
ball well and keeping up a good pres-
sure defense. Reserve guard Bill
Rhyne and Charlie Stone have shown
good speed and agressiveness on de-
fense and have demonstrated their
ability to score when necessary.
Thursday night the Generals take
on Bridgewater College at 8:00 p.m.
in Doremus. This promises to be a

good game as the Eagles defeated
Macon last week. Jim Upperman
and Jay Cook have always been
rough against the Generals and a
good job of defense will be necessary
to win this one. The attendance at
the last two home games has been
low (606 and 542); it is hoped that
more people will be able to find time
to support the Generals Thursday
night.

 

 

Player of

Too often in evaluating
the performances of a bas-
ketball player the scoring
average is the only criteria
applied. Overloked are such
things as turnovers, assists,
defense and rebounding
which can make or break a
team effort. On the basis of
these vital but un-noticed
qualities in a ballplayer, this
week’s Player of the Week
is Mel Cartwright.

Mel is currently leading
the team in rebounding and
is tied for the lead in assists
(Jody Kline is the other
leader). Mel is one of the
most unselfish people ever
to step foot in Doremus
Gymnasium as he is con-
stantly passing up the “good
shot” in order to give some-
one else a better one. Mel’s
scoring average has stayed
about the same although he
is taking fewer shots per
game. Mel exemplifies the
true team player as he is
constantly foregoing per-
sonal glory for the more im-
portant goal — a winning
team.

BITS AND PIECES

By RIC BERARD

Whoever is responsible for the
installation of the complete arc-light-
ing system for the basketball court,
the new metal stands and the renova-
tions of the handball courts deserves
the thanks of all the W&L community.
These improvements, following the
new scoreboards and refurbished pool,
really brighten up the place. Now all
we need....

ae at ak

I was watching a football game on
TV the other day, and I couldn't get
over the bush-league performances of
the supposed “star” on one of the
teams every time a penalty was called
against himself or his team. Nothing
is more ridiculous than to see a
“class” ballplayer hurt himself and
his team by hamming protests to the
officials. While not every call by an
official is going to be the right one,
making an exaggerated protest to all
humanity about every penalty only
detracts from the ballplayer. Fortu-
nately, we don’t have anyone at W&L
like that yet, although it’s an easy
habit to fall into.

of ak *

If there is one wish I have for the
new year in terms of W&L athletics,
it is that Coach Mac “Nubie” Mc-
Laughlin devote his full time and
activities to instilling an increased
sense of pride and initiate a period
of growth across the board in W&L
athletics. When Coach Mac assumes
his new position as Director of
Athletics next fall, I seriously question
that he is going to have the time to
perform as well as he would want
to the duties of both head football
coach and Director of Athletics.

At W&L, athletics are a potential
source of great school pride, and,
with the change of administrations
within the Doremus staff, I hope seri-
ous consideration is given to answer-
ing this need. However, in spite of the
best of intentions, an effective job
cannot be done by only off-season
attention to the task ahead.

* * &*

Finally, | believe that in the com-
ing year one of the most noble uses
ever made of athletics will be wit-
nessed this summer in Mexico City
when the United States’ Olympic
teams find that America is indeed a
bi-racial society that cannot perform
at its maximum unless all its minori-
ties work as one. Should America’s
dynamic essence as a “melting pot”
be disavowed because of a color bias?
I think not; I believe the reason will
be made abundantly clear in Mexico,

Overflow Crowd Expected

 

MR. NIXON visited Roanoke in 1965 on behalf of GOP gubernatorial

candidate Linwood Holton, W&L grad

Nixon's visit here day after tomorrow.

Thursday's address to Omicron
Delta Kappa by former Vice-Presi-
dent Nixon is expected to attract an
overflow crowd,
officials have arranged
modate in Lee Chapel.

The entire address will be relayed |

to the Chapel, where it will be broad-
cast over the public address system.
The public, which is invited, will
be asked to adjourn to the Chapel,
since attendance at the function itself
is compulsory on the part of the stu-
dent body and administration.
Arrangements are being worked
out whereby all visitors will be in-
vited to Doremus Gym for the less
formal question-and-answer session
with Mr. Nixon following his speech.
Broadcast and print news media
from Virginia have indicated they will
cover the speech in depth, although
Mr. Nixon is not expected to make
a major announcement. Advance

Faculty Promotions

The promotions of two members of
the Washington and Lee University
faculty were announced Thursday by
Dr. William W. Pusey III, Dean of
the College and Acting President.

Dr. William G. Heigold becomes
an assistant professor of romance
languages, and Maj. Gerald E.

Poudrier is an associate professor of
military science.

A graduate of Washington Uni-
versity, Dr. Heigold joined the Wash-
ington and Lee faculty as an instruc-
tor in 1965. He received his Ph.D.
last month from the University of
Ilinois,

Maj. Poudrier joined the WAL staff
in 1966 as a captain and assistant
professor of military science. He has
since been promoted to major and
become executive officer of the Re-
serve Officers Training Corps unit at
WAL. He is a graduate of Indiana
University.

All-CAC Team
For Football

(Continued from page 3)

Centre’s Jack Smith and Washing-
ton’s Ed Kelly each got three votes at
tackle, to be selected along with
WA&L’s unanimous pick Thompson.

The All-CAC defensive backfield
includes five players, instead of the
usual three. Washington’s fine safety
Sam Williams poled three votes to
lead the bunch, but four others—the
Bears’ Jeff Jones, W&L’s Charlie
Freret, Southwestern’s Sam Cooper,
and Sewanee’s Jim Beene—tied with
two ballots each.

A strange situation developed at
end, where Sewanee’s versatile two-
way star Mike Knickelbine got a single
vote on the offensive platoon and two
on the defensive unit. He was placed
on the defensive team because he
drew more votes there.

Offensive Team

Ends—Boon (Sewanee) and Arnold
(Southwestern); Tackles—-Thompson
(Washington and Lee), Smith (Centre),
and Kelly (Washington); Guards—
Sheehan (Sewanee) and Thompson
(Centre); Center—Underwood (Sewa-
nee); Backs—Boone (Centre), La-
monica (Centre), McKean (Southwest-
ern, Gignilliat (Sewanee).

Defensive Team

Ends—Mackenzie (Washington and
Lee), Grantz (Washington), and
Knickelbine (Sewanee); Tackle—Hub-
bard (Sewanee) and Edwards (Centre);
Middle Guard—Harris (Washington
and Lee); Linebackers—Lewis (South-
western), Wolf (Washington and Lee),
and Silvey (Centre); Backs—Williams
(Washington), Freret (Washington and
Lee), Jones (Washington), Beene (Se-
wanee), Coper (Southwestern).

receive grade F for the semester,
unless he is excused for reasons
deemed sufficient by the Dean and
instructor concerned.

1968: 17S CAUSE AND CURE
Are you still writing “1967” on your papers and letters?
I'll bet you are, you scamp! But I am not one to be harsh

with those who forgot we are in a new year,

for I myself

have long been guilty of the same lapse. In fact, in my
senior year at college, | wrote 1873 on my papers until

nearly November of 1874! (It turned out,

incidentally,

not to be such a serious error because, as we all know, 1874
was later repealed by President Chester A. Arthur in a fit

of pique over the Black Tom Explosion.

hasty action,

Who does not recall that famous meeting between Mr.
Arthur and Louis Napoleon when Mr. Arthur said, “Lou,
I wish I hadn’t of repealed 1874!’ Whereupon the French
emperor made his immortal rejoinder, “Tipi que nous et
tyler tu’’. Well sir, they had many a good laugh about that,

as you can imagine. )

But I digress. How can we remember to write 1968 on
our papers and letters? Well sir, the best way is to find
something memorable about 1968, something unique to fix
it firmly in your mind. Happily, this is very simple be-
cause, as we all know, 1968 is the first year in history that

is divisible by 2, by 5, and by 7. Take a

pencil and try it:

1968 divided by 2 is 984; 1968 divided by 5 is 393%; 1968

divided by 7 is 281!

;. This mathematical curiosity will not

occur again until the year 2079, but we will all be so busy

then celebrating the Chester A.

Arthur bi-centenerary

that we will scarcely have time to be writing papers and

letters and like that.

Another clever little trick to fix the year 1968 in your
mind is to remember that 1968 spelled backwards is 8691,

“Year”

spelled backwards is “

backwards is “Annosrep:’ I mention Personna because I
am paid to write this column by the makers of Personna
Super Stainless Steel Blades, and they are inclined to
withhold my check if I omit to mention their product.
Not, mind you, that it is any chore for me to sing the
praises of Personna, for it is a seemly blade that shaves
you cleanly, a gleaming blade that leaves you beaming, a
trouble-free blade that leaves you stubble-free, a match-

But I digress. We were speaking of the memorable ase
pects of 1968 and high among them, of course, is the fact
that in 1968 the entire House of Representatives stands
for election. There will, no doubt, be many lively and inter-
esting contests, but none, I'll wager, quite so lively and
interesting as the one in my own district where the lead-

ing candidate is none other than Chester A

Mr. Arthur, incidentally, is not the first ex-president to
come out of retirement and run for the House of Repre-
