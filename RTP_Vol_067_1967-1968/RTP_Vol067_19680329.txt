SIPA Convention Convenes Here

While Students Are On Vacation

By PAT AREY

Ah Spring! When a young man’s
fancy turns to .. . well, would you
believe the Southern Interscholastic
Press Association convention?

The SIPA (pronounced SEE-PAH)
convention will open its 39th session
on the W&L campus next Friday. The
convention has been sponsored since
1925 by the University’s Lee Me-
morial Journalism Foundation,

About 1,200 high school journalism
students and advisors will attend the
two day convention.

The leading speaker this year will
be Charles McDowell, syndicated
columnist and Washington corres-
pondent for the Richmond Times-Dis-

Spring Vacation

Spring holidays will begin tomor-
row at | p.m. and last until Monday,
April 8, when classes resume at 8:25
am,

Absences for all students before
and after the holidays are limited to
students on the Dean's List; to those
on the semester and midsemster honor

rolls; and to seniors in their last
semester who are applicants for their
degrees, if they do not need more

than 15 semster hours and 30 grade-
points to be graduated, and if they
have a cumulative gradepoint ratio of
at least 2.00 and a gradepoint ratio
of at least 2.00 on the work of the
preceding semester

 

patch. McDowell, who has also
authored several books (“( ‘ampaign
Fever,” Morrow, 1965; “What Did

You Have in Mind?”), is a graduate
of Washington and Lee.

McDowell will speak at the open-
ing convention session Friday morn-
ing in Doremus Gymnasium. All gen-
eral sessions will be open to the
public.

Richard L. Tobin, managing edi-
tor of the Saturday Review, will also
speak at the convention. He is an
author, newspaperman and commenta-
tor. He served with the New York
Herald Tribune for 24 years as re-
porter, editor, and editorial writer
before joining the Saturday Review
in 1961.

Tobin has covered national politi-
cal conventions, served as a war cor-
respondent and worked in the Eisen-
hower and Nixon presidential cam-
paigns. He will speak Saturday at
12:05 p.m. in Lee Chapel on “Mass
Communications: Pattern for Pro-
gress.”

Aside from the speeches by Tobin
and McDowell, a series of short
classes and workshops will be con-
ducted for the SIPA delegates. The
subjects will include all aspect of
secondary school journalism—news-
papers, magazines, photography, year-
books, and radio work,

About 14 WAL students will be on
campus during the weekend to help
run the convention

BY BILL JACOBS

Yelling at the top of their voices,
17 W&L students competed Tuesday
in Doremus Gymnasium for the posi-
tion of Clerk of the Rolls in the up-
coming Mock Convention. The posi-
tion is one of utmost importance,
for the Clerk of the Rolls is the
person who announces the states and
the number of votes per state for each
candidate at the Convention, A very
loud voice is required plus a voice

 

with clarity of pronunciation.

Bystanders included several  stu-
dents, many whose sporting activities
were interrupted by the constant
shouting .The judges for the trials
were W&L faculty members who
were located on the indoor track at
the opposite side of the gym from
the contestants,

Much to the disappointment of the
contestants, live pigs were not used to
provide background noise. However,

 

: >
the taped background noise of the
1964 Mock Convention was used.

This proved to be a most adequate
substitute for the pigs.

The 17 contestants, all students,
first read a roll of ten states. After
the students “blew” their lungs, the
judges made their first elimination.

They chose the six they thought
were the best to compete in the sec-
ond trials,

The “loud” included Haskell

Law School

By REED BYRUM

The Washington and Lee School of
Law is now “actively considering”
changing its present degree from an
L.L.B., Bachelor of Laws, to a J.D.,
Juris Doctor. Both, however, are
quivalent professional degrees.

William and Mary, University of
Chicago, Emory University, and West
Virginia University are among the
law schools now granting the J.D.
degree to their graduates, Currenily,
about one-third of the nation’s law
schools offer the J.D.

The Juris Doctor was begun in the
early 1900's at the University of
Chicago by Professor Joseph Beale,
the first dean of the law school there.

Dean Charies P. Light, acting head
of the law school, stated “Ever

Dickinson, Kappa Sigma junior from

Phi Delt law student from Charles-

Epsilon freshman from Roanoke, Va.;
Devon Allen, senior from Lynchburg,

Meridian, Miss.; and Ken George,
Sigma Nu sophomore from Midland,
Texas.

Each semi-finalist read half the roll
of states in his loudest voice. From
these six, the judges chose two final-
ists—Paul Neville and Kenn George.

These two each read a role of five
states, and then the judges made their
final decision—Ken George was de-
clared the winner and became the
Clerk of the Rolls for the 1968 Mock
Convention,

The judges also decided that Paul
Neville, due to his rather distinct
accent, would occationally be added
for color,

Some Sigma Nu’'s at the competi-
tion took the credit for George’s win
by saying they allowed George to
practice at 6:30 every morning.

 

More Courses
In Theater Art

Recommended

The committee on Courses and
Degrees Tuesday recommended that
the number of course offerings in
theater and dramatics be increased.

This action was taken at the sug-
gestion of Mr. Lee Kahn, fine arts
instructor and director of the Trouba-
dour Theater.

Committee Chairman William W.
Pusey, Dean of the College, said that
the fina] decision rested with the
faculty as a whole. The next faculty
meeting is Monday, April 8.

Mr. Kahn's target date for imple-
mentation is the fall of 1969, pro-
vided the faculty approves.

The administration has in the past
also affirmed its intention to build
a new theater to replace facilities now
in use.

Young Republican Club

and panel discussions on club organi-
zation and operation. Topics include
leadership, organization, finance, man-
power, publicity, membership, com-
munity service and programming.

Young Republicans throughout the
Commonwealth of Virginia have been
invited to attend and participate in
the conference.

The program will be held during
Saturday afternoon in classrooms and
the auditorium of duPont Hall. The

The purpose of the conference will
be to teach basic organizational meth
ods for running an effective club.

Effective organization, according to

No Defense, No Redress

“Every faculty member should be a good academic
citizen, loyal to the University with freedom of thought
and expression, ready to co-operate with other faculty
members, willing to share committee work and admin-
istrative responsibility and to represent the University
to outside organizations, academic and/or civic. He must
be an individual of intellectual integrity, whose state-
ments shall merit the trust and authority accorded his
position,”

—University-Wide Policy

SX

The appearance of a letter in this news-
paper recently alleging unfair grading prac-
tices on the part of a professor here, and the
publication last week of an underground sheet
attacking a number of other professors, has
made apparent a very serious and potentially
unpleasant problem in an area of W&L life
which has traditionally been placid—faculty-
student relationships.

Few would deny, we think, that the faculty
and the attitudes towards education which it
represents is one of the most successful fea-
tures at W&L. Students here from freshmen
on up are granted opportunities for close
working relationships with their teachers which
are inconceivable at most major universities.
The student-teacher ratio is maintained at ap-
proximately 12 to 1. Emphasis very definitely
is placed upon teaching, rather than upon re-
search. No W&L student spends his first two
years studying under graduate students, as
happens frequently at larger universities. In
most courses, teachers can and do spend time
with individual students, pursuing the indi-
vidual student’s interests, and ironing out in-
dividual problems. It is a rare situation in an
American college when a department chair-
man is as easily available for consultation with
students as the lowliest visiting lecturer. Not
surprisingly, both faculty and administration
point to such attitudes with pride, and en-
courage them.

But what happens to the student when
something goes wrong? If a faculty member
were to willfully grade a student down because
of “poor attitude,” where would the student
go for redress? If another teacher should
average out a student’s grades and then drop
them by two letters, where does that leave the
student? To whom can a student appeal when
his professor “refuses to discuss the incident”
or “sees no purpose in argument’? The an-
swer to these questions, as any student who
has ever been in the situation is well aware,
is that at W&L there is no redress, no defense,
and no place to appeal to.

Ww

Teachers in ancient and medieval times
were paid directly by their students, so it was
good business policy for them to be both
interesting and fair. The modern university
has made the teacher independent of stu-
dent control, thereby giving him his right to
be dull, without limiting his right to be un-
fair. At W&L, as at many other colleges, the
right to be unfair has been erected into a
fixed principle.

If this seems difficult to believe, then we
might examine a couple of hypothetical cases,
which, however, have grounds in actual oc-
currences on this campus. Imagine that Stu-
dent X has received a C in a three-hour course,
after having made grades which he feels cer-
tain entitle him to an A or at least a B. Sup-
pose, too, that for whatever reasons the teach-
er in question refuses to discuss the subject
any further than to say, “A large number of
factors went into your grade.” If student X,
unlike most students, chooses not to accept
this, he may then approach the dean of the
appropriate school with his grievance. here,
Student X receives a hearing on the express
condition that nothing whatever can be done
to alter grades which have already been re-
corded—it being the teacher's prerogative to
give grades as he chooses. Accepting this con-
dition immediately removes Student X's whole

purpose in being there, and leaves him with

the option of pursuing the issue to no tangible
goal, or of giving up the whole affair as a
bad job. The teacher retains the right to act
and grade as he wishes. The student retains

the C.

Or take Student Y, the member of a
campus organization directed by a faculty
member or official. Following the publiciz-
ing of certain thoughtful but critical remarks
about the organization, Student Y is removed
from his position in it without explanation,
and then expelled from the organization
altogether. In this case, there is not even a
dean for him to appeal to.

Ww

The problem as we have stated it is not
exaggerated. It is actually made worse by the
refusal of those most concerned—the faculty
—to recognize it as a problem. An examina-
tion of the 460-page “Self-Study Report” of
1964-66 indicated that that massive and care-
ful self-examination suggested not one word
on the subject. To a majority of professors
and administrators, the mere possibility of
unfairness on the part of another professor
is inconceivable; judging their colleagues by
themselves, they automatically assume that
every student with a grievance has either mis-
understood the facts or is only pursuing a
personal vendetta. They react with amusement
to the idea that a student can possibly be in
a position to judge of a mature professor’s
actions. And they react with shock and anger
to any student who tries to press his case.

This blindness is mistaken and potentially
dangerous. The absence of any apparatus
for the correction of grievances at this uni-
versity leads naturally to considerable bitter-
ness on the part of the students concerned,
and gives respectability to underground satire
of the cheapest quality. As conditions are now,
a serious and moderate student, if he finds
himself in a situation which he honestly con-
siders unjust, is forced into the position either
of weakly acquiescing or of raising a public
outcry—neither of them really satisfactory
alternatives. The best course, a quiet and fair
inquiry into the case, is simply not open.

Frankly, we don’t know where the answer
to the problem lies. We rather doubt that any
organization made up solely of students could
handle such a delicate job, or that its decisions
and recommendations would receive much
consideration within the faculty. Perhaps some
faculty group could take the job, although
we suspect that very few teachers would like
to have to sit in judgement on their colleagues.
Perhaps, as at some other colleges, there
could be someone along the lines of the
“ombudsman,” an officer directly respon-
sible to the president, with the duty of investi-
gating student grievances of this nature; but
then, it is difficult to imagine anyone wanting
to play the Devil’s advocate. He would tend
to be somewhat unpopular. Some apparatus
needs to be found to execute some policy
which neither displays a cool and suspicious
attitude toward all student complaints, nor
limits by inquisition the teacher's proper free-
dom of action. The consideration of what form
such an apparatus should take, and the policy
it should pursue, should be the job of both
faculey and students during the very near
future.

What is more important for the present,
however, is that members of the faculty and
administration recognize that the problem
does in fact exist; that to ignore it further is
to invite increasingly unpleasant incidents; and
that their cherished freedom of action cannot
be made the excuse for arbitrary and unfair
practices—practices against which at the pres-
ent time the student has no defense. Once
this recognition is made, then a major part
of the problem will have taken care of itself.
And positive action, we hope, would follow.

After a break of eight years (“due
to unsettled conditions in 1920 no
interest was taken in the matter and
it passed by without action on the
parts of the students”—Ring-tum Phi,
April 19, 1924), Washington and Lee’s
Mock Democratic Convention was
revived in 1924.

The faculty voted to declare a one-
day holiday for the revived conven-
tion; the Ring-tum Phi billed the
issue as having “Action [that] will
be taken to make the trial as realistic
as possible, a serious occasion under-
towed with humor, and make be-
lieve.”

The fourth Mock Convention was
called to order at 3:30 p.m. on May
14, 1924. Thirteen candidates were
nominated, including ex-Secretary of

 

the Treasury William G. McAdoo,
Governor of New York Al Smith,
1920 Democratic Candidate James
N. Cox, Senate Minority Leader Oscar
Underwood, and ex-Ambassador to
Britain and President of the Ameri-
can Bar Association John W. Davis.

A floor debate developed over
inclusion of a prohibition article in
the platform. “The wet element,
fighting for an amendment for
wines and beer as part of the party
platform clashed with the pro-
ponents of .. . unflinching enforce-
ment of the laws of the govern-

Letters To The Editor ...

 

 

To the Editor:

The Tuesday Edition’s snide, smug
commentary on last Friday's Viet-
nam demonstration represents a high
standard of journalistic objectivity
not equaled since President Johnson's
State of the Union message was cov-
ered in Komsomolskaya-Pravda,

In their clumsy, club-footed attempt
at humor, by placing a cute caption
and precious headline around the
photograph of last Friday's demonstra-
tors, they demonstrate an intolerance
that is unbecoming and slightly un-
ehical. What's more, it was wreich-
edly poor humor.

I am not in sympathy with the

 

viewpoint of the demonstrators, Nev-
ertheless, I strongly feel that

if only as straight news. Passionate)

those in front of Commons last week
were on a frivolous spring lark. They
should not be discouraged

I write to correct an error in the
Tuesday Edition. A flippant Tuesday
Edition writer asserted that last Pri
day's peace vigil and parade proved
“the presence of 30 or so pacifists
in the student body and faculty.” It
proved nothing of the sort. Opposing
a particular war does not qualify a
person as a pacifist, Pacifists oppose
wars in general

(Ring-tum Phi, May 14, 1924). The

Another resolution lauded “the

U; nderground Paper

Criticizes Teachers
By RON KESSLER

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw left Lex-
ington Thursday to go to a wedding.
When he returned on Sunday, he
learned that his name was in the
news.

The “news” appeared in an em-
bryonic thing called “Notes from
Underground.” A boxed item at the
top of the legal-sized page stated:

“This paper is dedicated to provid-
ing a public media for the contro-
versial.”

With this, “Notes from Under-
ground” sliced into five professors.
“Tenure Breeds Senility” read the
headline, prominently placed at the
top of page one,

Age is thus equated with incompet-
ance.

“Our faculty,” says “Notes from
Underground” has a few members
whose tenure at the University has
meant that they no longer convey
intellectual vitality to their courses.”

Five stories about five professors
follow. The stories are cute. They
are even funny. They don’t indicate
senlity, though. Nor do they indi-
cade a “lack of intellectual vitality,”
to quote from “Notes from Under-
ground.” They're just cute. And
funny.

But the headline is there: “Tenure
Breeds Senility.” In capital letters.
Thus, according to “Notes from Un-
derground,” five professors are senile.

Not everyone agrees with “Notes
from Undeground.” After all, “Notes
from Underground” is dedicated to
the “controversial.”

So, A Protest appeared. Mimeo-
graphed, distributed throughout the
campus, the Protest asserted.

“It is obvious that the author
of that statement has never taken
one of Dr. Crenshaw's courses.

personal lecturer with the ability to

The patient suffers from a persecu-
tion complex. He feels that someone
is out to “get” him. He reads un-
founded meanings into the things
written about him. He feels that he
is right and the others wrong, and,
consequently, he gets mad. The other
person, seeing that things are getting
out of perspective, pulls up short and
attempts to scrutinize the situation,

So what's all the b.s. about? No,
we are not reviewing the Caine
Mutiny. The above paragraph just
about describes the feelings of the
Athletic Department towards the Fri-
day Sports Page, and I, as Friday
Sports Editor, feel that it is neces-
sary that these feelings be analyzed
and some conclusions reached.

Policy Statement

In my Opening column back in the
fall, 1 stated that I hoped to help
“put athletic awareness and team pride
back into the student body of Wash-
ington and Lee.” | spoke of the
merits of “athletics in an unsubsidiz-
ed environment” and hypothesized,
rather idealistically perhaps, about
the future of athletics at this Uni-
versity. That column, I felt, set the
tone for the 1967-68 edition of Fri-
day Sports.

I feel that, to the best of my
ability, I have not deviated from this
goal, and this is where I and the

Athletic Department disagree. While
pledging myself to the athletes of
Washington and Lee, I said nothing
about my obligation to their coaches
and to the Department in general.
Many of the coaches have failed to
make the distinction, and therein lies
the rub.

If desubsidization at W&L created
no other great distinctions, it did
separate coaches from players in a
way different from before. The ama-
teur replaced the professional on the
athletic field, but the professiona!
coach remained. He was still getting
paid to do a job, and his success was
still measured in the yardstick of the
past—the won-lost column.

Weeding The Garden

With the change in the basic athletic
philosophy at the University, coaches
who could not see themselves fitting
into the new pattern were gradually
replaced by those that would accept
the new status quo. These are basic-
ally the coaches that today comprise
the Athletic Department, and I firmly
believe that they all, in viewing the
overall picture of the University, be-
lieve in unsubsidized athletics at
Washington and Lee. These men are
sincere men who are 100 per cent
for their boys and, most of the time,
like Caesar’s wife, they are above
reproach.

But one would have to be blind
not to recognize that things are not
all smiles in the Athletic Department.
While perhaps a little harsh, the
“Sumerod” story in the Tuesday Edi-
tion of a few weeks back was a fair
indication of the behind-the-scenes
maneuverings that Doremus has been
and is witnessing. An old guard-new
guard rivalry does exist. What its out-
come will be is anybody's guess, but
this columnist feels that he would be
shirking a journalistic duty if he
ignored it in print.

When things such as this crop up,
the parties involved naturally tend to
react suspiciously toward their reveal-
ing source. The Ring-tum Phi is prob-
ably read more between the lines
than on them in the gym, with the
disease Ring-tum Phobia the result.

Before that disease reaches epi-
demic proportions, this columnist

Thunder’s Theories

 

By THUNDER THORNTON
Friday Sports Columnist

Somedays there’s nothing to eat

| but crow.

Last week UCLA showed the na-
tion who is really number one in
college basketball. The tournament
is the best way to provide proof of
such a statement, and the Bruins fifty-
five points worth of evidence (their
total margin in the two final round
games at Los Angeles) was certainly
enough to make me a believer,

I recall settling down before the
tube last Friday expecting to see a
tightly contested game between the
field’s two stalwarts, Houston and
UCLA. In my ignorance, I even gave
the Cougars a chance to win, dis-
regarding the fact that they had lost
a big man in their plans, George
Reynolds, as just a challenge to make
the game more interesting.

It was interesting. Most of that
interest was generated in wondering

 

|| how this Houston team could have

| beaten the west coast boys before.
| True, the circumstances were dif-
| ferent. In the previous game UCLA
| had played with a half-speed Lew
Alcindor and suffered through a poor
| shooting night. Also, the loss of
| Reynolds hurt the Cougars to a cer-
tain degree. But after watching the
Bruins sprint out to as much as

Stickmen ‘To Meet Dutchmen Tomorrow
With New Coach And Surprising Depth

An experienced defense, an attack |
led by All-America candidate Chip)

Chew, and a midfield loaded with
depth will characterize Washington
and Lee University’s lacrosse team
when the Generals open a nine-game
schedule this Saturday at Hofstra Uni-
versity.

Under new head coach Dick Szlasa,
a former All-America at Maryland,
WAL will send 12 lettermen against
the Flying Dutchmen, that itself a
signal the Generals should be and
will be a better club this season.

At one time, though, right around
the start of pre-season drills, there
were some doubts W&L would be able
to field a squad competitive with its
opponents.

Lyles And Company Head South

 

A lack of consistency, difficulties
in picking up assignments, and a
minimum of unity were the chief
culprits.

“We were having our troubles,”
says Szlasa, “but we feel we ironed
out most of them in our scrimmages.
We made progress all along, to the
point where we now think we are
ready to go.”

The Generals met Adelphi, Ohio
State, Yale, and Dartmouth in a series
of controlled scrimmages over the
past two weeks. In each event, Szlasa
stopped action when he felt his
charges needed a little inspiration.

“We went over our mistakes then
and there,” says Szlasa, “and it was
probably the best thing we could have

 

 

In Search For Winning Season

Washingion and Lee University’s
eager baseball squad, which has not
experienced a winning season in seven
years, will be seeking to change that
format this time around when the
Generals take to the road next week
for Spring Vacation games in the
Sunshine State against Florida Pres-
byterian, St. Leo's, and the University
of Tampa.

With lettermen sprinkled just about
everywhere, 13 of them, head coach
Joe Lyles’ outfit is at its best strength
in years, thanks in part to the return
of all three outfielders and a con-
struction job in the infield that makes
that area tops in defense,

“We're definitely looking for bet-
ter fortunes,” says Lyles. “We have
a solid outfield with juniors Jim Wil-
son in left, co-captain Thom Mitchell
in center, and Charlie Freret in right.

“Each one can handle a bat well,
and that’s going to take a lot of pres
sure off our pitchers,” adds Lyles

Lyles’ main concern is with his
pitching staff, a corps that includes
only a few veterans. Senior co-captain
Bill Rasmussen, a righthander, leads
the group which includes junior port-
sider Lee Halford, senior righthander
Ed Mitchell, and freshman southpaw
John Botcheller.

“We could use some more help,”
says Lyles, “especially from a left-
hander or two, Maybe a couple will
come out of the woodwork at mid-
season.”

For the time being, though, enough
outstanding personnel exist so that

The scrimmages
was particularly strong at defense,
where lettermen Charlie Stewart, a
junior, and seniors Harold Stowe,
Holmes Raker, and goalie Dave
Johnson appear set for opposing at-
tackmen.

Johnson has held a starting assign-
ment in the nets for the past three
years, so his experience there should
have a guiding influence on his mates
up the field.

Stewart, Stowe and Raker each have
the size necessary for a defenseman,
which combined with their savvy
makes for a dependable trio help-
ing to protect Johnson.

Perhaps the most improved aspect
of the Generals’ scrimmage play was
attack, a spot where senior Chip
Chew seems to have taken command.
Chew was impressive in every con-
test, often beating his man to score

would have benefitted from the best
guard in the country as a replace-
ment for Reynolds.

It was a question of too much
talent packed into the blue and gold
uniforms of UCLA. Coach John
Wooden has roamed the nation over
to assembly possibly the strongest col-
lege basketball team ever. Of con-
temporary (post 1950) squads that
have dominated NCAA play, none
seem to have put five players on the
florr to match UCLA’s lineup. San
Francisco had Bill Russell and K. C.
Jones, Cincinnati had Paul Hogue,
Ron Bonham, and Tom Thacker, but
the fivesome of Warren, Allen, Shack-
leford, Lynn, and Alcindor seems to
come as close to a “dream team” as
a mortal coach can recruit.

An example of the team strength
that the Californians possess is the
way the Big E, Elvin Hayes, was
shackled. It was not Alcindor, but
Mike Lynn, who did the defensive
job that turned Hayes, who had been
a tiger in the Astrodome, into just
another ballplayer. So good was Lynn,
the “fifth” man on the team who
probably is a little less well known
than his four teammates, that Edgar
Lacey, a member of the Gail Good-
rich-led UCLA champs, had to find
a new place to display his wares.
Apparently Lacey was a mere mortal,
thereby not fitting into Coach Wood-
en’s lineup of supermen.

But, gentlemen, you yourselves are

the organ of this eye—the W&L stu-

The Friday Ring-tum Phi does not

actions to the contrary of the spirit
of athletics at this University (which
undeniably have been committed in
the past) will not go unnoticed.

As long as you are behind the
ideals of this University, in relations
with your athletes, the student body
as a whole, and with each other, this
sports page will be behind you. But

posed to an L.L.B. Secondly, it gives
appropriate recognition to those who
go to graduate school the same num-
ber of years as a medical or a dental
student. The graduate law student re-
ceives only a bachelor’s degree, while
the others are granted a M.D. or a
D.D.S. for a similar amount of time
and effort.

The confusion that would exist in
the change-over from an L.L.B. to a
J.D. is the main argument opposing
the Juris Doctor degree. It would pri-
marily be misunderstood as the post-
graduate law degree of SJ.D. or
J.S.D.; the latter are awarded only
after post-graduate study is done by
the student and are of greater signifi-
cance than the professional degrees.
Secondarily, the sequence of degrees
given by those schools which use the
L.L.B. program would be confused by
a J.D. A person with a doctorate
would end up in post-graduate work-
ing for his master's degree, an L.L.M.,
causing a complete reversal of terms
