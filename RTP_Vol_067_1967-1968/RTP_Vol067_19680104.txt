Republican Leader
On Campus Jan. 11

Former Vice - Presideni
Richard M. Nixon will speak
at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity January 11.

Nixon will address the an-
nual “Tap Day” ceremony for
Omicron Delta Kappa, nation-
al honorary leadership society
founded at Washington and
Lee in 1914.

Officials for Nixon who are
arranging the appearance have
given no indication of the for-
mer  vice-president’s _ topic,

 

other than it will be “non-
political” since Nixon has not
yet officially announced wheth- |
er he is a presidential candi-|

date.

Nixon has been quoted as saying
he will announce his decision in Jan-
uary. As previously scheduled, he
also will speak later that same day
at a Richmond Chamber of Com
merce dinner meeting.

A number of Washington and Lee
undergraduates and several alumni
will be “tapped” for membersh’p in
the society following Nixon’s talk at
noon. A brief ceremony, during which
present members of ODK will tap the
new members on the shoulder to sig-
nal their selection, will precede a
question-and-answer-session with stu-|
den‘s

Public announcement of those chos-
en for membersh’p is not made until
they are tapped

Nixon, who is already a member
of ODK, was invited to the campus
by W&L senior David T. Johnson, Jr.,
of Pensacola, Fla., president of the
local chapter.

The ODK ceremony at Washing on
and Lee is tradit‘onally an offic.al
University assembly, and all siudents
and faculty members are expected to
attend. This year’s 53rd annual event
will take place in Doremus Gymna-
sium beginning at noon.

Dus to the assembly, there will be
short classes on Thursday. Classes
will begin at 8:25 am and will ex-
tend for forty minutes ins:ead of the
regular fifty-five, ending at 11:45 a.m.

After serving as a United States
Representative and as a Senator from
California, Nixon was elected V.ce
President of the United States in
1952 and was re-elected in 1956,

He won the Republican nomination

for President of the United States in|

1960, and lost by a marg:n of only

one-tenth of one per cent of the popu-
lar vote. He ran for Governor of
California in 1962 and was defeated
by incumbent Democrat Pat Brown.

Since then, Nixon has practiced law
in New York City and has travelled
widely.

During his term of office as Vice-
President, Nixon saw the powers and
prerogatives of that office expanded
more in eight years than during the
entire 162 years previous.

 

 

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, JANUARY 4, 1968

ODK Assembly To Hear Nixon

 

| Nixon: A Political Phoenix

by PAT AREY

Richard Nixon, political myth, or
epithet? He is the man who has
been written off as “finished” in na-
tional politics more times than any
other politician in American history.

And yet no politician has become
so admired by party workers and reg-
ulars in the history of the Republican
Party.

Despised by the intellectual com-
munity on the left, and not quite
trusted on the right, even though
he is Barry Goldwater’s choice for
the 1968 GOP Presidential nomina-

Richard M. Nixon

tion, and lacking a political base to
operate from, incredibly, Richard M.
Nixon may well end up with another
crack at the Presidency. Eight years
ago, he lost that office by a hair.

Six years ago, following his defeat
by California Governor Pat Brown,
Time magazine wrote Richard Nix-
on’s political obituary; so did every-
one else.

He campaigned heavily in the
1964 campaign. He campaigned again
in the isolated state elections in 1965,
He made a swing through Virginia,
where he gained an ally in the GOP
gubernatorial nominee A. Linwood
Holton, who is now a member of the
Nixon for President Committee.

Nixon was the most active of out-
side campaigners in the 1966 Con-
gressional races. He ran up an im-
pressive score in Republican victories
in the districts he campaigned.

No single Republican has whole-
heartedly given so much of his time
to his party, with so little to expect
in reward from his party’s right and
left.

But today, unquestionably that re-
ward looms large. In short, Dick Nix-
on, as the political adage goes, has
“done his homework.”

But more than a cloud looms dist-
ant on Nixon horizons. The plain
facts are, Richard Nixon’s support
among potential delegates to the Re-
publican National Convention next
August is marginal. He has no sup-
port on the left; and his support on
| the right would melt under a Reagan
boom.

One must admire the man. He has
| worked long and hard for his party.
| It could be said he has earned the
nomination more than any other Re
| publican.

But 1968 seems a winning year for
| the Republicans. Many state parties
|are tying up their delegates under
| favorite son candidacies. The party
| wants a winner. And ironically, the

 

|| One man who seems a winner, the

|
man who has been endorsed on the

‘ | Republican right and left, the man

who isn’t running, the man who
nominated Richard E. Nixon in 1960,
is Governor Nelson A. Rockfeller of
New York.

Richard Nixon, to many people,
looks too much like a loser.

To win the nomination, Richard
Nixon must wn all the primaries,
and he must w.n big. If he stumbles
once, he is dead. If the Ronald Rea-
gan movement gets going, Nixon is
dead. If the Republicans want a win-
ner, Nixon may very well be dead

Can he win? Odd-numbered years
are usually good years for wine. Per
haps 1968 will be a good year for
Nixon. The campaign begins in nine
wecks
