Nixon’s nomination assured

Student activism urged

Despite the difficulties now facing
America, Nixon expressed confidence
that the opportunities of today have
never been so great. The U.S. is in
the position to bring about world
peace, and “whether the U.S. will
develop its leadership will determine
this peace,”

Nixon also proposed that organiza-
tions and programs formed in_ the
past be brought up to date. He said
if he were elected, he would institute
a “new diplomacy which brings up to
date the institutions which were start-
ed 20 years ago.” He mentioned the
UN, NATO, and foreign aid in his
list of old or outdated institutions.

In conclusion, Nixon praised the
active involvement of students in na-
tional and foreign affairs. He also
emphasized that although peace in the
world cannot be achieved by only
one nation, the United States can
nevertheless provide the effective lead-
ership to help accomplish this end.
“Il am confident,” he said, “that we
can meet this challenge.”

Faculty salaries

Faculty salary and compensation figures show Washington and
Lee to be maintaining, and even improving upon, our already
well-above-average pay scales, according to statistics compiled
by the AAUP.

The average salary here this year for all full-time faculty
is $11,625. Average compensation (that is, salary plus the
value of fringe benefits) is $13,254. Starting from a base that
was high to begin with, W&L increased its average compensa-
tion by 7.2 per cent this year. W&L is second to no private
institution in Virginia, and second only to UVa among all
Virginia colleges. Most significantly, we are the 83d-best-
paying college among the 1,000 colleges ranked by the AAUP.

AAUP ratings, placed on an A-through-E scale, speak for
themselves, and speak well:

The Ring-tum Phi Awards

The annual presentation of the Ring-tum Phi Awards will take
place tomorrow evening during the Senior Banquet. The
Awards, which were presented last year for the first time, are
sponsored by the Publications Board and are designed to
provide public recognition of, and express appreciation for,
conspicuous and distinguished service to Washington and
Lee University.

The Awards are intended to complement rather than com-
pete with other vehicles of recognition. In naming each year’s
recipients, members of the selection panel (page editors and
Editors-in-Chief of both Editions of the Ring-tum Phi) pay
particularly close attention to the accomplishments and dedica-
tion of those teachers and administrators whose unusually
valuable service would otherwise pass with no formal ac-
knowledgement, as well as students. No more than five Awards
may be presented in any one year; tomorrow, four presenta-
tions will be made.

Each recipient has the sincerest thanks of the Ring-tum
Phi and, we are certain, of the entire University community.

VMI: sad, sad, sad

Poor VMI.

Some day soon, the Virginia Military Institute is going to
rise up like Czechoslovakia. Not even a cadet can take much
more of what the administration of the Institute is dishing out
these days.

The latest incident, according to reports in VMI’s student
newspaper, confirmed and augmented by the Ring-tum Phi’s
own reliable sources, concerns a number of paintings by the
daughter of a W&L faculty member: they were hung in the
“rather sensitive corridors of LeJeune Hall” as part of Vir-
ginia Military’s scheme of offering “an intellectually stimulat-
ing educational program” emphasizing “training both in and
beyond formal courses.”

One hour later, the paintings were taken down. It was said
they were scandalous, because they violated VMI's “military
tradition.” The ironic part of the affair—what makes it un-
amusing and frightening instead—is the fact that the faculty-
daughter / painter is a nun, and her pictures “stressed Christian
love.” It seems “intellectual stimulation” and “Christian
love” are all right at VMI—in their place. Which is right
below “military tradition.” Poor VMI.

Incidentally, remarkable Mrs. Munger of W&L’s re-
markable paperback bookstore has entered the battle on the
side of the Right and the Just. The paintings that were banned
at VMI have been hung in her shop, which will probably be
declared off-limits to the cadet corps as a result. We won't be
a bit surprised, though, if we see defiant cadets sneaking sur-
reptitiously in, glancing furtively at the non-militaristic artwork
on the walls, while purchasing their contraband copies of the
Southern Collegian.

Poor VMI.

Ug

The end of Ed’s era

It gives us great pain to have to report, elsewhere in today’s
Ring-tum Phi, the distressing news of Ed Side’s decision to give
up operating the Lyric Theatre (he has leased it to a graduate
of VMI—the supreme slap). He and his absurd, but none-
theless beloved, building have become irreplaceable fixtures
in the W&L Way of Life: two singular institutions that almost
by themselves made living here interesting enough to be bear.
able. Nobody could spend any time at all in Lexington and
fail to be profoundly influenced by Ed Side and the Pit.

By JAY PASSAVANT

Now that the hectic pace of political
campaigns, student elections and mock
national conventions has ground to a
halt, | would like to take a moment
to briefly review some of the goals
and objectives I intend to pursue dur-
ing my tenure as student body presi-
dent.

To begin with, | plan to seek im-
provement of the broken and_ in-
efficient lines of communications be-
tween students and the faculty and
administration, There is no question
that a more workable and a more
reliable system of information can
be established, for example, between
President Huntley and the average
WAL student. Certainly, this involves
bypassing several intermediates, but
the President has expressed an interest
to me that he would like to hear
it straight from the students them-
selves, and what more can we ask
for? | am sure that an effective system
would give those interested students
a really sound means of communicat-
ing their ideas to the head man him-
self.

Personally, | would like to see some
type of definite action taken on sev-
eral issues presently confronting the
student body. Of course, one of the
first issues is that of Saturday classes
—I feel that the issue has been
dragged out long enough and if the
faculty really desires such a change, a
concrete plan can be worked out in
the very near future. I plan to seek
action in favor of the abolishment of
Saturday classes—provided a suitable
five-day program can be formulated,
and hundreds of other schools have
found it possible.

The Junior Year Abroad program
is another issue still up in the air, as
is the flexible exam schedule and the
suggested relaxation of present distri-
bution requirements. Having served on
the Curriculum Committee, I am fully
aware of the problems involved in
these issues and I hope, by working
through the committee and its cap-
able new chairman Swede Henberg,
to arrive at some definite conclusions
and to make concrete proposals to the

Passavant cites goals
of new administration

faculty concerning their validity. In
addition, if one or all of the above
issues meets with negative success in
the eyes of our committee or the
faculty, | plan to inform the student
body as to why such a_ response
was incurred,

The present Assimilation Commit-
tee, its purpose and goals will be
re-evaluated in full and proper action
taken to improve its effectiveness on
the W&L campus.

For the benefit of many law stu-
dents and perhaps undergraduate
upperclassmen living in dorms, I
intend to endorse their plea for re-
laxation of the rules concerning girls
in their dormitory rooms. | feel this
rule is outdated and in the case of
these men affords an unnecessary bar-
rier to a reasonable social life, a
barrier which can easily be removed
and wouldn't cost a cent.

I plan consultation with Dean At-
wood and Mr. Whitehead concerning
the fraternity loan system which I
advocated in my campaign.

For Lexington community interest,
the idea of the Big Brother system
met with considerable favor and I
would like to work out the details of
such a program with Dr. Hodges and
Lexington officials.

These are but some of the ideas
and objectives I would like to see
reached in the upcoming school year.
Other important issues of course exist
and with the help of the newly elected
executive committeemen and other
student body officers, definite action
can and will be taken on these issues.
I would like to encourage any reader
of this article to offer any suggestions
or viewpoints to me on issues that he
feels important, by mail, phone or
direct confrontation. A student gov-
ernment is only as effective as you
want it to be—I assure you that I
will strive to my utmost to secure
the changes that you, the W&L stu-
dent body, so desire. | thank those
of you that were such an important
part in making my campaign success-
ful, and I request the support of the
entire student body in effecting the

 

changes we all want to see.

Some conditions in Fertile Valley

create causes for

By REED BYRUM

Hillside Terrace, one of the two
apartment complexes for married
students, has decayed into a rodent-
infested, insect-ridden, rotten health
and safety hazard. Several occupants
were contacted earlier this week con-
cerning the existing situation at
“Fertile Valley.” They were asked to
answer six questions about the living
conditions in this complex and to
express the complaints of the other
residents in the area.

(1) Do you feel that these apart-
ments are in safe and clean condition?

The principal feeling was that the
apartments are fine fire hazards, since
they are constructed of only fiber-
board. The old wiring which has not
been replaced since the original con-
struction of the buildings, and the
attics, which are full of old rags and
junk left by previous residents, were
also noted as being dangerous.

The apartments were also cited as
being very difficult to keep clean:
holes in the ceiling and the floor let
dust in the rooms, as do the openings
in the walls caused by faulty con-

 

Letters to the editor

Rockefeller,

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

As co-chairmen of the New York
delegation and as the principal floor
fighters for the candidacy of Gov.
Rockefeller, we have been beseiged
the last few days since the Mock
Convention by people who wonder
at our action on the third ballot.
While most people understand why
we had to call for a unanimous vote
for Richard Nixon, some indicate that
they believe our move was part of
a deal, and even some suggest that
there was a sinister plot between our-
selves and the Nixon forces, or be-
tween ourselves and the Mock Con-
vention secretariat. We assure you it
was nothing as exciting as the latter,

New York moved for a unanimous
vote for Richard Nixon on the third
ballot for these reasons:

(1) We knew from our very efficient
Rockefeller floor managers that
regardless of the votes of Texas and
California, it would be very close,
Nixon having an edge:

(2) When we added the
delegation, Nixon was over;

(3) Even though we might have
picked-up quite a lot of votes in
California, we could not stop Nixon
after the Reagan forces released their
delegates;

(4) Rockefeller in all his public
addresses has made it quite clear that
he will not engage in any actions that
will divide the Republican Party. The
New York delegation to Miami will
respect this wish of the Governor's,
In light of the first three reasons, it
was clear that Nixon would be nomi-
nated, Te continue to fight a losing
battle would be pointless, whereas, a
motion for unanimity would serve to
unite the Party. Our action was thus
dictated by reason;

(5) We were cognizant of the fact
that if we continued to fight, it would
look as if the Reagan people had put
Nixon over the top. They would be,
therefore, in a strong position to de-
mand the Vice-Presidency for Reagan.
A Nixon-Reagan ticket is politically

tract anybody Besides Republicans.

With a number of striking de-

1968 Calyx will be unusual, interest-

volume will begin this week, accord-

One's first impression is of the
superb color photography, beginning
with the unique and stark blue
portrait of the Colonnade. The color
pictures move on as section dividers
with the snow (yellow) in front of
Washington Hall; people laughing

coming display of the Lambda Chi
house (before it burned).

though, the 1968 Calyx is a remark-

struction.

(2) What exactly are
blatant physical problems?

The thin walls present the greatest
trouble to the occupants. These caused
a lack of privacy, as well as a great
deal of noise. In some wall areas,
the light shines through the misplaced
pieces of wallboard and emits into
the neighboring apartment.

The truss construction is rotting out,
and the wallboard is swelling from
water saturation, In several apartments
there are holes in the ceilings from
water drainage, and openings in the
walls from gnawing rodents,

Heating is another problem of
great concern. It is inadequate: there
is only one main heater for the
whole apartment, in the winter it is
especially uncomfortable because the
warmth does not spread evenly
throughout the apartment,

(3) Do you have any problems with
insects or rodents?

The rats and mice have chewed
holes in the walls of some of the
rooms. One person complained of
having a rat in his heater, while
another cited a case of a person
finding a rat in her fold-away bed.
Spiders and fleas constitute the big-
gest pest problem; they nest in the
ceiling and climb down through the
holes in the fiberboard.

(4) Have you had any problems
with your gas or electrical facilities?

Having only about three circuits
per apartment, a great problem is
caused by overloading. The electrical
sockets are inconveniently placed and
average about one per room. Safety

Balloting mixup
merits revision
of election laws

By REEVE KELSEY

‘Today there exists a degree of un-
certainty about the election rules for
the student body elections. Recently
the Executive Commitiee spent near-
ly an hour debating the electoral pro-
cedure in an attempt to unravel the
procedure into a consistent structure,
but after an hour of discussion the
EC reverted basically to the same
methods used before. A law student
had challenged the legality of the
primaries during the big-four elections,
and write-ins during the final presi-
dential election caused confusion and
ultimately another run-off,

One of the inconsistencies men-
tioned by the EC was the possibility
that a strong candidate could poll a
majority of votes cast in a primary
against two weak opponents. Would
not he have a justifiable claim to
have won? Is it not also quite ridicul-
ous to force him to wait and run up
another majority in the second elect-
ion? Likewise the EC is faced with
the problem of write-ins; are they
legal? What should the EC do if
write-ins obscure a clear majority for
either of the two major candidates?

The laws in the Student Body
Constitution were written when politi-
cal parties were dominant and when
there were seldom more than two
candidates running for any office. I
would suggest to the EC that it con-
sider amending the electoral laws to
conform to the present operating
system and to remove any possible
ambiguities from that system.

Petitions should be circulated as
currently required. There should then
be the primary in the present time
sequence with write-ins legal for any
office. even those not contested in
the primary. In the case of an office
with only one or two candidates run-
ning for it, if a write in candidate
receives more than 10 per cent of the
votes cast he should then be consid-
ered an official candidate, The top

This past weekend saw a very
sparse sports schedule as the Mock
Convention stole the limelight. The
coming week, however, should prove
to be an exciting one with the high-
light being the College Athletic Con-
ference Spring Sports Festival held
here on Friday and Saturday. The only
group of Generals not participating
in the C.A.C., the lacrosse team, will
meet Atlantic Coast Conference mem-
ber Duke University in Durham on
Saturday afternoon.

The week’s action begins today
with the glovemen taking on Lynch-
burg College at 3:15 p.m. on their
home field, Tomorrow the successful
golf team will journey to Madison in
what should be one of their easier
matches. On Thursday the tennis team
will meet Centre College in a pre-
lude to the weekend tournament.

The tournament will begin Friday
morning and run through until Satur-
day afternoon, This year the Gen-
erals stand a real good chance of
capturing the overall championship
and keeping the C.A.C. Bell here in
Lexington. There will be action on
all fields practically all day so every-
one should take the opportunity to
stop by for a while and watch the
conference's best battle it out in any
one of four sports.

be willing to pay?

The present rate is only $38 per
month; as cheap as this is, many of
the occupants feel that they are not
getting very much. These residents in
response to the second question felt
that they could and would pay $10-
$15 more per month for better hous-

(6) Do you feel that these units are
worth repairing or should they be
replaced?

The general opinion was that they
should be replaced, rather than be
repaired. They liked the location and
the communal aspect of the apart-
ments, but rather disliked the physical
plant.

A review of Mock Convention events

THE RING-TUM PHI

Republican platform will
call for volunteer army

The Mock Convention reconvened
for Platform hearings Friday evening.
The purpose of this session was to
debate on amendments and determine
the final wording of the Republican
platform. Former Gov. Henry Bell-
mon of Oklahoma spoke to a reduced
audience on the purpose of a plat-
form and the changes which the plat-
form should urge.

Basically, Gov. Bellman said he
felt the platform should be a true
statement of the nation’s status and
the principles of the Republican party.
That the platform must deal with
division at home and war abroad
and propose an altrnative to the Great
Society was Gov. Bellmon’s thesis.

One change the former governor
urged was the abolishment of the
electoral college, in the governor’s
opinion an outdated and undemocratic
mode of election.

The first amendment proposed dealt
with the section of foreign policy,
specifically that segment on Vietnam.
The proposal asked that the platform
include a passage requiring that the
National Liberation Front be includ-
ed in any peace negotiations. This
motion was rejected.

A second amendment, also rejected,
concerned a passage in the section on
national defense. The proposal had
requested that a phrase be added to
the platform stating that space and
missile programs would not take pre-
cedence over domestic problems.

Platform Fight

The third amendment offered, also
dealing with the section of national
defense, proposed the abolishment of

667 mark. With that, many states
shifted their votes away from the
amendment, and it appeared as if it
would be decisively defeated. The
bandwagon, however, failed to de-
velop and confusion reigned as more
states changed their votes and the vote
counters fell far behind. After calling
an end to the voting, the votes were
counted and the amendment had
won,

The final significant piece of busi-
ness Saturday was the nominating of
a vice-president. Reagan jumped off
to an early lead, but Percy built up
strength in the northern states and
soon the Reagan floor manager with-
drew his name and Percy sailed to
an easy victory.

the draft and the creation of a volun-
teer army. Unlike the other two
amendments, which were determined
by a voice vote, this proposal was
decided by a roll call of the various
states. At the end of the first ballot-
ing, the motion was six votes short
of passage.

However, a discrepancy in the
total and the desire by many states to
change their vote led to a second
balloting. This time, the amendment
was passed by a vote of 694 to 634,
with five abstentions. No other amend-
ments to the platform were proposed,

Percy gets nomination
easily on first ballot

On the first ballot a tired Conven-
tion nominated Sen. Charles Percy of
Illinois for Vice-President.

Besides Percy, ‘Tower, Agnew,
Reagan, Rhodes and Chaffee were
nominated for the office. The con-
vention started off with strong support
for the California governor as Ala-
bama, Arizona and California gave
all their votes to Reagan. Percy pass-
ed Reagan when Michigan gave 40
votes to Percy; Reagan regained the
lead as Mississippi gave their votes to
Reagan, but Percy pulled ahead and
stayed there when Missouri gave its
24 votes to Percy.

Percy's lead increased until the
Reagan floor manager stated that
Reagan could not accept the second
spot and withdrew his name. Despite
futile hopes of a few favorite sons,
Percy moved on to a smooth victory.

Variety: spice of the parade

A suitably exciting and colorful
opening to an exciting and colorful
Mock Convention was provided by
the convention parade. Supplying the
greater part of this pageantry were
the floats built by the various delega-
tions.

A panel of judges appraised the
floats and awarded prizes, First prize
went to the Nebraska delegation; Wis-
consin’s float took second place; and
third prize was awarded to the
Hawaiian display.

Originality was the key to the
themes of the winning floats. Ne-
braska’s slogan, “The seeds of victory
are sown in Nebraska,” was depicted
by an American-Gothic-like scene
featuring a farmer and his pregnant
wife. A large can of Schlitz, Wis-
consin’s greatest contribution to the
nation, formed that delegation’s float;
passengers on the float sang the jingle,
“when you're out of Shlitz, you're
out of beer.” From a small state came
a small display; the prize-winning
Hawaii delegation float was a pine-
apple.

Other floats attempted to picture a
scene from their states’ culture or
history. The Alaska delegation’s float,
which displayed a Klondike scene; the
hillbillies with their moonshine still
on the Tennessee float; and the Mis-
sissippi delegation’s float with its cot-
ton bales and Confederate flags were

typical of this variety.

Two floats which adopted current
topics as their themes were the
Michigan and Washington, D.C.,
floats. The former showed a large
painting of Detroit with the caption
“Soul Capitol” on it. “Who can put
out the fire?” on the D.C. float
referred to the recent riots there.

Missouri, like Wisconsin, was also

two or four condidates then auto-

is the present custom,

The final election would then have
two candidates running for one office
or, as in the case for EC representa-
tives, four candidates running for two
offices. Write-in votes would be void,
and the candidate with plurality of
votes would be considered the winner,
Only in the case of a tie would there
be the need for a run-off.

 

represented by its greatest contribu-
tion in the form of a can of Bud-
weiser. The spirit of the Hawaii dele-
gation’s float was also captured in
the display provided by the Utah
delegation. It consisted of a simple
sign with the words, “For eight votes,
you expect a big float?”

FROM THE HALLS OF PROTOZOA

This column, normally a treasure house of twinkly quips
and slapdash japery, has now been appearing in your
campus newspaper for fourteen years, and if I have
learned one thing in these fourteen long years, it is not to
try to be funny in the last column of the semester. With
final exams looming obscenely close, you don’t want jokes;
you want help.

So today, foregoing levity, I give you a quick cram
course in the subject you are all flunking. | refer, of
course, to biology.

Biology is divided into several phylla, or classes. First
is the protozoa, or one-celled animal. Protozoa can be
taught simple things like bringing in the newspaper, but
when shopping for pets it is best to look for animals with
at least two ceils, or even four if your yard has a fence
around it.

 

Another popular cle
‘ndowy cateory that borders of|
ake, for example, the sponge. The sponge is definitely an
nimal. The wash-cloth, on the other hand, is definitely not.

Next we come to the arthropoda, or insects. Most people

find insects unattract: ve, but actually there is exquisite
beauty in the insect world if you trouble to look. Take, for

of animals is the periphera—a
moon the vegetable,

instance, the lovely insect poems of William Cullen
Sigafoos— Tumbling atong with the Tumbling Tumblebug
and Fly Gently, Sweet Aphid and Guats My Mother
Caught Me. Mr. Sig#foos, alas, has been inactive since the
invention of DDT,

Our next category is the mollusca—lobsters, shrimp, and
the like. Lobsters are generally tound under rocky projec-
tions on the ocean bottom, Shrimps are generally found in
a circle around a small bowl containing cocktail sauce,
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades are generally
found at any counter where Personna Super Stainless
Steel Blades are sold.

I mention Personna Blades because the makers of Per-
sonna Blades pay me to write this column, and they are
inclined to get edgy if I neglect to mention their product.
Some get double edgy and some single, for Personna
Blades come both in double edge style and Injector style.

Mind you, it is no burden for me to mention Personna,
for it is a blade that shaves quickly and cleanly, slickly and
keenly, seratchlessly and matchlessly. It is adistinet pleas-
ure to shave with Personna Liades and to write abou
them but sometimes, | coniess, I find it dificult to wor
the commercial into a column, Some years ago, for ex
ample, I had the devil's own time working a Personna plug
into a column about Alexander the Great, The way I finall
managed it was to have Alexander say to the Oracle ot
Delphi, “Oracle, I have tasted all the world’s pleasures,
yet I am not content. Somehow I know there is a joy I have
missed.” To which the Oracle replied, “Yes, Alexander,
there is such a joy—namely Personna Blodes—but, alas fo
you, they will not be invented for another 2500 year
Whereupon Alexander fell into such a fit of weeping that
Zeus finally took pity and turned him into a hydrant...
Well sir, there is no question I sold a lot of Personnas with
this ingenious commercial, but the gang down at the
American Academy of Arts and Letters gave me a mighty
good razzing, you may be sure.

But I digress. Back to biology and the most advanced
phyllum of all—the chordata, or vertebrates, There are
two kinds of vertebrates: those with vertical backbones
and those with horizontal, Generally it is easy to tell them
apart. A fish, for instance, hes a horizontal backbone, and
a man has a vertical backbone. But what if you run into
a fish that swims upright or a man who never gets out of
the sack? How do you tell them apart? Science struggles
with this aticky question for vears before Sigafoos of
M.1,T. came up with his brilliant solution: offer the crea-
ture a pack of Personna Blades. If it isa fish, it will refuse,
If it is homo sapiens, it will accept—and the more sapient,
the quicker.

And now you know biology
