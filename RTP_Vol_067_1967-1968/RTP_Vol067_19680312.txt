London Set

rhe setting of “The Country Wife”
is London during the 1680's. Horner,
a Londoner, devises an idea to aid
his amorous adventures, He pays Dr.
Quack to spread the rumor that be-
cause of an operation for the pox,
Horner is now sterile. The “country
wife” of the title is the beautiful
young wife of Mr. Pinchwife. Pinch-
wife, who has secretly married her
in the country, brings her to London.

There she is attracted to the theatre.
Because of her physical charms, she
gains the attention of many men,
especially Horner, who is completely
taken by her. The play continues with
various intrigues, seductions, and
counter-seductions. By the end, how-
ever, everything works out, and the
characters pair off with their proper
mates,

Last night the Executive Commit-
tee selected Herb Crenshaw, Lee Hal-
ford, Danny Leonard and Pete Hen-
dricks to consider the selection of a
student to receive the Gilliam Prize
and to accept recommendations from
students, faculty and administration
for candidate for the award.

Criterion Listed

The criterion by which the prize
is judged were listed by the EC.

The student must have made a
valuable contribution to student
affairs. This contribution might take
the form of outstanding contribu-
tion in one field or in many fields.

It shall not be necessary that the
recipient have held any particular
office or position. It should seem

that special attention should be
given to the student who has pro-

vided the necessary leadership to
re-activate a sluggish organization
or establish a functioning organiza-
tion with a worthwhile purpose.

The student should not have merely

performed an important job well,

but should have done an outstand-

 

to correspond as closely as possible
with their original seventeenth-cen-
tury counterparts. This task is the
responsibility of David Hall, a sculp-

; :
tor in the fine arts department.

Crenshaw Book
Traces History

Of This School

Professor Ollinger Crenshaw has
announced the completion of his his-
tory of Washington and Lee, which
has been in the works since post-
World War Il days. The book, en-
titled “General Lee's College—The
Rise and Growth of Washington and
Lee.” traces the school from its very
humble beginnings in the 18th cen-
tury through its crises and glories up
to 1930, after which an epilogue fol-
lows which brings the book up to
the 60's.

The book comprehensively covers
the growth of the school, and has
been thoroughly documented and re-
searched, attested to by Dr. Cren-
shaw’s many trips around the country
and tireless groping around musty and
somber libraries.

In choosing the name of his book,
Dr. Crenshaw admits no idolatry of
Genera! Lee, simply pointing out that
Lee “put the school on the map, it
having beforehand been a remote and
provincial college.” Washington Col-
lege first came to fame not under
that name, but as “General Lee's”
College. as Lee's connection to the
school brought admiring Southerners
from all sections of the South,

Although the sources of informa-
tion on the school were sometimes
scanty and fragmentary (especially in
the 18th and early 19th centuries),
Dr. Crenshaw has followed the de
velopment of the college closely with
attention to the curriculum, the stu
dent life, the changing influence of
the presidents, the effect of national

Hitchens To Lead Seminar
On New American Cinema

A three-session seminar on the New
American Cinema, led by Gordon
Hitchens, editor of “Film Comment,”
will take place at Washington and
Lee University March 18 under the
auspices of the University’s Depart-
ment of Journalism and Communica-
tions.

Under the title “The American
Avant Garde and Independent Film,”
the seminar will explore the current
explosive production by young Ameri-
can film makers of documentary, ex-
perimental and underground films.

Leading Film Makers

In addition to his editorship of one
of the leading film publications of
the country, Hitchens is himself a
leading maker. He is an assistant pro-
fessor in the Communications Arts
Department of the New York Insti-
tute of Technology, film instructor in
the School of Visual Arts of the
Horace Mann School, New York, and
the American’ representative and
panelist at the film festivals at Mann-
heim, West Germany; Leipzig, East
Germany; and Florence, Italy. He is
a frequent speaker at university film
centers, and the author of numerous
articles on the film.

General Orientation

Hitchens will present a general
orientation on contemporary indepen-
dent film making at the morning ses-
sion of the seminar, including an
analysis of aims, content and signifi-
cant practioners. Afternoon and eve-
ning sessions will be devoted to the
screening of representative samples of
avant garde films, with commentary
by Hitchens.

Between sessions Hitchens will
meet informally with students and
discuss production problems with
those students making films this
semester.

Anti-parietalism

There can be little argument, we think, with Mr. Timmerman’s
letter in the Friday Edition asking for, among other things, a
bit of twentieth-century thinking about dormitory regulations.
It seems at times that the rules of which he speaks actually
antedate the dorms themselves, and that makes them very,
very outdated indeed.

But the prospect for change is not bright. In one of the
few less-than-satisfactory sections of the Self-Study Report,
it is written that the dorms consist of nothing but bedrooms
and that it is considered inappropriate to allow students to
“entertain women” in them. When one is a freshman, though,
there is nothing else to be had at any price—and dorm rooms
become, of necessity, living-rooms, dens, studies and even
kitchens, as well as bedrooms. It is not the University, nor any
committee thereof, that decides in which of these capacities
the dorm rooms would be serving if women visited them. In
dealing with the dorms, bedroominess lies in the mind of the

beholder.

Mr. Timmerman and the Tuesday Edition could probably
both write endlessly, though, and not change the University’s
Augusta-Academy-era thinking. Not only does the Self-Study
invite no optimism about parietal-regulations-change, but it
even demands other kinds of Orwellian supervision: “im-
mediate priority’ was given in the report to the “need” to
institute “regular health and safety inspection of all living
quarters occupied by students,” specifically and arrogantly
including apartments.

Perhaps we should resurrect a plan that was inexplicably
discarded last year when the dorms question was so big: stop
talking about “requiring” anybody to live in dorms; chalk
up the existing dorms as lost causes, as gross mistakes; build
into new dorms the conveniences and attractions of apartments
(benefits which, compared with what the dorms offer now,
are too numerous to be mentioned); finally—and most im-
portantly—charge rents which are low enough that, when
combined with the comparative physical benefits and the
suspension of humiliating, mama-esque rules, students will
voluntarily seek to occupy them. It might take several addi-
tional years to pay off mortgages on dorms which are not
monastic cells, but might even that not be to the University’s
long-run advantage?

Who says...

.. . that symposia at Washington and Lee exhibit a “depress-
ing sameness as to topic”? Why, this Friday, Professor Duvall,
chairman of the Department of English, is delivering a talk
entitled “Some Observations on the Southern Romance” to—
would you believe? —the Chemistry Seminar.

 

Staff Editorial

‘They're using us as bait’

No occurrence epitomizes the malady of the Vietnam conflict as well
as the isolation of the Marine garrison at Khe Sanh and the despair sweeping
its beseiged occupants. That the 4,800 Marines in the camp are “bait,” at
least for the delight of the 20,000 or more NVA surrounding this outpost,
is becoming increasingly apparent. With little hope of air evacuation or a
significant increase in direct troop commitment, the beleaguered await what
David Leitch calls the “coup de grace,” the end of their war.

Leitch is a correspondent for the London Sunday Times who visited the
camp and interviewed 60 Americans, His report was printed in the February
25 issue of the Washington Post. In his analysis, this foreign observer found
the troops depressed and embittered at their “government and generals.” And
yet, according to Leitch, if and when the battle comes, the men will fight.
But then, what else could they do? The enemy cannot and will not absorb
4,800 POWs.

Not sheltered by deferments and white protective columns, these young
men are facing an issue which all of us in Lexington are still trying to
avoid. Indeed, it is quite easy to be “patriotic” at W&L-——particularly if you
ignore the war and harbor sweet dreams of continuing the educational womb
in graduate school, But now, because of Louis Hershey, even “minks” are
going to confront this existential question sooner or later.

For the Marines in Khe Sanh, however, this decision has already been
made. But—what should be of great concern to all of us—is the fact that
their resolve appears to be one not based on conviction but on the tragedy
of circumstance

Assuming these direct quotations represent the consensus of the men
that he interviewed, Leitch credits them as saying:

“Kindly get me out of here. I'll go on a chopper, I'l parachute
If you insist man, 1 walk, but just take me out of this place.”

“I the planes can't come any more, then the Reds are going to
attack. What are they [NVA] going to do? You don't have to ask
that question, friend. They just have to start running over that wire
when it's dark and we kill a few of them and they keep coming
and then we say good night, No problem there,”

“| write my wife all the time. Naturally, | couldn't get away
with telling her what's really going on—nobody Stateside knows
that, and if they did know they'd blow their minds.”

“You tell them they're using us as bait.”

there? What is the military rationale behind such
an ultimately indefensible commitment? Is the reason for our presence
there really as a “bait"? And if so, to whom is this baiting directed? Is,
then, the purpose of such an engagement to make legitimate our total effort
with a renewed national sense of moral righteousness? Do we want to proclaim
“Remember Khe Sanh” in this election year?

The answers to such questions deserve our increasing atiention, even
for those of us secure within the confines of Rockbridge County, Hopefully,
our own sensitive shoulders will not have to bear the guilt of moral inactivity
in face of a likely battle at Khe Sanh. But if there is a fight, the Marines
will die for our detachment

It's a shame they don't want to, It rather ruins the story

But why are “we”

By LAWRENCE McCONNELL

Ring-tum Phi: | suppose the first ques-
tion I should ask you, Don, is how
did you first get interested in drama?
Don Baker: Oh, | suppose it was in
high school. I did a one-act in my
senior year for English. It was fun,
but I really wasn’t too excited about
it. | didn’t do anything here until my
sophomore year when I took an act-
ing class because | thought it might
be interesting. The first role I ever
had here was Lucky: a part in (“Wait-
ing for) Godot.” Then I got the lead
in the next one which was “Richard
II,” and I've been with it ever since.
R-t Phi: How did you eventually be-
come interested in directing?

around with everything in each show.
I could never just worry about my-
self. It was the whole show.

R-t Phi: Had you ever done any
directing before this?

Baker: Yes, last year | directed a one-
act called “Pull Out His Eyes” as a
project for the directing class I was
in. Then we did “Midsummer Night's
Dream” this summer. I decided it
would be fun to do so I got some
of my friends together here in Lex-
ington, and we put it on.

R-t Phi: How did you get the job of
directing “Country Wife?”

Baker: I don't know. I guess Mr.
Kahn just decided he wanted to have
one student director a year and he
picked me. He sure did pick a diffi-
cult show for me to handle, through.
R-t Phi: Why?

Baker: Because for this show you
need flamboyant costumes and we had
a limited budget as well as a director
with 'imited experience. We had to
have the costumes made by Martha
Stuart, Dabney Stuart’s wife, and
Sandra Wilhelm, a student at South-
ern Sem. David Hall had to get the
set made with almost no money and
we had to put it on this dinky stage.
We really needed a long and narrow
stage to produce this play in period
style. The style was such that if two
actors entered from opposite ends of
the stage, they weren't supposed to be
able to see each other. It's kind of

ly” attacked during the past week
at Washington and Lee. The first on-
slaught came last week in this edition
of the paper with a story by German
special student Klaus Eder. He criti-
cized WAL for its conservatism and
“intolerance” toward “non-conform-
ing groups.” A more stinging extension
of his remarks by an unidentified stu-
dent (see Letters to the Editor on
this page) further castigates conserva-
tism and W&L’s “intolerance.”

It seems obvious from both of
these writers that they have a belief
that conservatism is tantamount to
apathy while liberalism is where the
action is. Surely there is a degree of
apathy at W&L; but it is not typical
of the conservatives or those that work
in the “narrow party politics.” Rather
than apathy here, we have one of the
most outstanding examples of mature,
constructive action in the country. A
story in the Tuesday Edition last fall
cited that W&L has one of the high-
est percentages of political club mem-
berships in the nation. Fully 60 per
cent of the student body belong to

In the small far-off town of Sume-

occur. Sumerod is a pleasant, staid
town about the size of Lexington; the
life rarely changes; it is lived in
the good way—the way their fathers
lived. Change, odious as it is, was
rarely contemplated by the good
citizens of Sumerod,

Yet there was a small clique of
evil, corrupt men who desired change;
what they called improvement was
in fact a giving-up of the old proven
good for the uncharted evils of the
future. The town was run by an old
man: a man once of great dynamic
qualities, but now quite faded. Mayor

the efforts of those who are the most

Monopoly On Tolerance
Surely liberals have no monopoly
on tolerance. Three immediate ex-
amples of their dogmatic obsession
come to mind. Upon Richard Nixon’s
visit to W&L in January, a group of
anti-Vietnam protestors distributed a
mimeographed sheet which epitomized
“liberal” intolerance. With an atti-
tude of superiority and arrogance, the
flyer was insulting, and even the
former Vice-President’s most bitter
| detractors were embarrassed.

Klaus Eder Defended By ?

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

I found it truly amazing to hear
people call Klaus Eder a radical be-
cause of his “way-out” views as ex-
pressed in the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
(March 5),

He is not too far from the truth
when he calls our campus a “grave-
yard.” The W&L student seems in-
capable of much deep thought as the
level of conversation around here
never get above the subjects of dates,
parties and cars. The W&L student
accepts this school, society and the
world as it has always existed. There
is no doubting of past ideals; every-
thing from the past that is with us
today is passively accepted.

I think Mr. Eder makes a mistake
when he describes conservatism as an
excuse for non-existent political views.
Conservatism as an excuse only exists
in the South and to a larger degree
at W&L. Though the W&L student
is interested in politics, he does not
get deeply involved in the contro-
versies of the day. As a matter of fact,
the W&L man avoids the social,
economic and religious controversies
of the day,

This is due to a large extent to the
fact that the Southerner as seen at
WAL is for the most part a narrow-
minded, domineering, simple-minded,
outspoken supporter of conservatism.
When a W&L student gets hold of an
idea he doesn’t let go, so there is no
room for debate. The main problem
though, is that most of the students
don’t care much about the revolu-
tionary movements that are so stimu-
lating the campuses around the na-
tion.

That this school is dominated by
an archaic, unsophisticated fraternity
system is more than apparent. The
system as it presently exists thrives
on animalism, non-involvement and
anti-intellectualism. Our conservative
Southerner is incapable of tolerating
anyone who is liberal, creative, artistic
or philosophical. Quite simply, it
would appear that the W&L student
has not heard about the Christian
principles of toleration, understand-
ing and forgiveness so basic to our
Western society.

As a matter of self-preservation, I
shall decline to sign this letter.

opinions and statements expressed

not pair his moral integrity with
risk and with any thought of initiative.

Mr. Harsh was a pathetically frank
and honest man who could inspire
work out of the laziest of mortals.
He and Mr. C.A.N. Meadow were
often termed the radicals that really
desired to leave the old, staid ways
of the past. He often ignored Lewot's
restrictions on the use of city prop-
erty, and once Harsh was actually
caught with two pencils in his pos-
sion. Harsh’s evil ways sadly caught
the admiration of the respect of those
that worked with him in the clinic
and in the town waterworks.

The final figure in our narrative is
the young Mr. Davis who is the
General Assistant to Mr. Meadow,
Davis is another man who seems to
be constantly trying to undermine the
wholesome qualities of the status quo
using the obviously false criterion of
reason, Davis with Harsh and Meadow
form an insidious conspiracy which
is patently seeking to improve the
status quo which everyone knows can
not be improved. It is sad that these

The team ended up with a 5-7

Can Cute Catie Cut It?

the professors were staunchly con-
servative they had to go. This narrow-
mindedness has crippled the reputa-
tion, but it is now purged of wicked
conservatives.

Simple Minded?

And a final instance of “intoler-
ance” is no better exemplified than
by the letter which appears elsewhere
on this page. Mr. Eder was rather
subjective in his statements, but the
unidentified letter-writer is ridiculous.
His remarks about “simple-minded
Southerners” are not worth comment
and his point that W&L students are
not “involved” is wrong.

Involvement does not mean placard-
carrying as he must believe.

fhe political involment is already
overwhelmingly obvious, but there is
other activity. Even church attendance

project this to an audience.
R-t Phi: Do you think a longer re-
hearsal period would have helped?
Baker: Yes, it would have. I could
have used the first two weeks to work
on style and gestures alone, and then
1 could have begun work on the
script.
R-t Phi: Turning to directing in gen-
eral, what do you think the purpose
of a director is?
Baker: He's got to make his actors
achieve certain effects to underscore
the playwrigt’s meaning. In “Country
Wife.” I've tried to show the differ-
ence between the affected world of the
stage and the real world off the stage
An example of this is when a red-
leg [a “bit part” actor who moves
scenery during scene changes] comes
on stage, he forgets his line and all
the actors on stage are frozen into
various affected positions. Then, in
other situations, I've tried to under-
score the playwright’s purpose through
blocking techniques. | guess if you
had to sum it up, a director's got to
sell the play.
R-t Phi: Well, Don, where do you
