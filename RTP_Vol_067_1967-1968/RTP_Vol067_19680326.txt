The Viest Pamily in residence at the President's Home:

Clayton Epes Williams
1891-1968

Clayton Epes Williams, re-
tired dean of the Washington
and Lee University School of
Law, died in a Lexington hos-
pital early Monday. He was 77.

A professor at the University
here for 49 years, Williams
served as dean from 1944 until
his retirement in 1960. He re-
mained, however, on the fac-
ulty, as distinguished lecturer
in law, until his death,

University President Robert
E. R. Huntley, a former law
student of Dean Williams, said
“his death is a loss which will
be deeply felt, not only on the
campus and in Lexington, but
among the hundreds of students
upon whose lives his influence
has been profound and inspir-
ing.

“He was, above all, a truly
great teacher,” President Hunt-
ley continued. “His memorial
permanent one in the
and minds of his stu-

is a
hearts
dents.”

Dean Charles P. Light Jr.,
who succeeded Williams as dean
of the law school, had similar
remarks: “Dean Williams was
one of the great teachers of the
law,” Dean Light said. “His
loss will be deeply felt by all

of us.”

  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  

Dean Williams began his
long legal career as a student
at Washington and Lee in 1908,
alter attending Massanutten
Academy in his native Wood-
siock, Va. President of his class
his senior year, he received his
law degree in 1912 and was
awarded the honorary LL.D.
degree from Hampden-Sydney
College in 1951.

After graduation, he estab-
lished his law practice in Wood-
stock, where he subsequently
became Master Commissioner
in Chancery of the Circuit
Court (1913-16) and Common-
wealth’s Attorney for Shenan-
doah County (1916-19),

Dean Williams then returned
to Washington and Lee in 1919
as associate professor of law,
He was promoted to full pro-
fessor in 1920, to acting dean
in 1944 and to dean in 1946

He was a member of Omicron
Delta Kappa leadership fra-
ternity, Phi Delta and Order
of the Coif legal societies, and
Pi Kappa Alpha social fra
ternily.

VASG President Speaks To EC
About Purposes Of Organization

Last night Taze Schultz, the presi-
dent of the Virginia Association of
Student Governments, addressed the
EC to explain the purposes of his
organization and to answer possible
questions that members of the EC
might have. His appearance was in
response to the rejection of VASG
membership more than a month ago
by a 7-1 EC vote.

Curriculum Committee

In other action the EC announced
that applications for chairman of the
Curriculum Committee would be open
another week and that appointment
of the committee head would be de-
layed until the meeting after spring
vacation,

Election Plans

[he EC also announced the times
for “Big 4” elections and petitions.
The initial petitions of 150 names are
due at 6 p.m. on Monday, April 15.
They should be given to Jody Kline
at 805 McCorkle or at the Phi Kap
house.

Speeches for the candidates are be-
ing scheduled for the 16th in Evans
Dining Hall at 7 p.m.

If more than two candidates are
running for any position a primary
will take place on Thursday, April
18 while the election will be held on
Monday, April 22.

Class Elections

Action on the schedule for class
elections was deferred until the stu-
dent body oflicer elections have been
completed.

Schultz hoped that he could clear
up the objections of the EC to VASG
membership by answering the ques-
tions. The initial objections of the EC
were about association of W&L’'s

English Department Offers
Prose and Verse Awards

The five Mahan awards in creative
writing will be given by the English
department this spring. Four awards
will be granted for prose entries, and
one for verse entries.

The awards consist of a $100 ex-
emption from college fees during the
coming session, or the option of a
$60 cash stipend, Two prose awards
are open to freshmen, one to sopho-
mores, and one to juniors. The verse
award is open to men from any class
in the college except seniors.

May Decisions

Decisions will be reached early in
May. and awards will be announced
on the June commencement program.
All entries must be submitted by April
22 to Payne 32-A. No student may
submit more than two prose entries
and one verse entry.

All entries must be typewritten and
signed by a pen-name chosen by the
author, Attached firmly to each entry
there must be a sealed envelope with
the writer's pen-name on the outside,
containing the writer's real name,

name with an organization that might
be issuing policy statements that W&L
students did not agree with but would
be published with approval implicit
in W&L’s membership.

Schultz replied that the organiza-
tion was primarily directed at dis-
cussion and that no steps toward
policy statements of a larger nature
than student government problems
were planned.

Committee System

He explained that the basis of
VASG was the committee system and
that the committees themselves de-
termined the direction that their com-
mittees might take. The committees
would serve as forums for discussion

 

of problems in specific areas, such as
entertainment booking.

At no time would the decisions of
the committees be binding on the
member schools, according to Schultz,
and a member school could withdraw
its membership at any time it wished.

Steve Sandler commented that at
the Fall Conference of VASG which
he attended the committees seemed
effective and under good leadership
and direction,

Schultz went on to list the colleges
and universities in Virginia that were
members of the association. Among
the schools that are included are
Hampden-Sydney, Hollins, VMI, VPI,
Sweetbriar, Mary Baldwin, UVa, and

 

 

William and Mary. The only large
schools in the state unrepresented are
Virginia Union and the University of
Richmond,

Schultz said that Virginia Union
declined to join because it was not
offered charter membership and the
student government of the Negro
school felt slighted.

The student government of the
University of Richmond had changed
during the period of formation of the
VASG and earlier supporters of the
VASG had been replaced by students
who were lukewarm toward the idea
because local campus matters took

up too much of their time to allow for
VASG participation.

 

Lecture-Service-Relay Format To Be Continued Again

Greek Week Plans Progress

The Greek Week Committee has
announced that the second annual
edition of the IFC-sponsored event
will take place April 10 thru 12. The
format will remain basically the same
as it was last year, though a few of
the “rough spots” (such as the point
scoring) have been smoothed out.

There will be three phases to the
activities, which will attempt to
demonsirate the various aspects of
fraternities:

Lecture-Discussion

The first of the three, the lecture-
discussion program, will provide in-
formative as well as interesting ma-
terial about fraternities specifically,
ind life at Washington and Lee in
general. If possible, this year's pro
gram will include speakers from out
side the community who will

jective insight into our problems and

Drama at W&L,; or,
legitimizing the stepchild

It’s gratifying to know that the Courses and Degrees Com-
mittee met this afternoon to consider Troub Theatre Director
Lee Kahn’s proposal to expand the number of course offerings
in the theatre and dramatics, and also to double (from one—
Mr. Kahn himself—to two) the number of faculty in that
area of the arts. The Courses and Degrees Committee really is
the most educationally liberal of this University’s countless
faculty-legislative bodies. The C-&-D Committee has approved
a great many worthwhile changes, and has passed not one
measure which—either from the students’ point of view or
from the Hill’s own—was undesirable. Mr. Kahn’s proposal
is eminently legitimate, and perhaps even necessary to Wash-
ington and Lee’s stated purposes and functions—and there
is no other committee or administrative unit more likely to
recognize this than Courses and Degrees.

When we went to press this afternoon, the C-&-D Commit-
tee’s conclusions had not been reached. But after deriving
confidence in it from its record in the past, we should like to
note that a favorable decision, which we expect, is essential
to ending at least one of the crises-of-sorts in the Department
of Fine Arts. Mr. Kahn has been offered what he describes
as an extremely attractive position at another college, where
drama and theatre are being debastardized, brought under
the college’s wing as an honest-to-God respectable part of the
curriculum; where theatre is no longer just a necessary nui-
sance, no longer academe’s thalidomide baby. This college has
arranged to build for Mr. Kahn, if he likes—and he does—
an “exciting” new theatre. Compared with what he has to
work with here, it sounds to us like Mecca.

But Mr. Kahn has said he’ll stay here, if he is (1) promised
that a new theatre will eventually be built and that it will be
given reasonably high priority-ranking; and if (2) course-
offerings in drama here are expanded to a point of some com-
prehensiveness, beginning with the proposal of the C-&-D
Committee today—that is, if he can be assured that drama will
cease to be Washington and Lee’s ugly academic stepchild.

The first promise was made by the administration some time
ago, and it has since been reaffirmed periodically. If the sec-
ond was forthcoming this afternoon from the Courses and De-
grees Committee, and if it is to be implemented by the 1969-
1970 school year (Mr. Kahn’s target date), then W&L will
have not only taken another giant step forward in the rather
idealistic sphere of academic eminence, but we will also have
pragmatically assured the retention at this University of a
theatre director who has already done more than a world of
good for Washington and Lee, whom we decidedly do not
want to lose for any reason, and who could not be very easily
replaced, if at all.

One year from now: not the millen-

new lap of luxury, opens for business.

The first major construction project
in eight years, scheduled to be com-

March 15, 1969, is “on or even a
little ahead of schedule,” according to
Dean of Students Edward C. Atwood
Jr.

The hut that was sometimes smil-
ingly called a “student union build-

to: nothing still stands but the out-

entirely rebuilt.

It is again nearing election time, the
roses are red, the politicos are politic-
ing, and God is in his heaven. Un-
doubtedly there will be someone,
coveting the mandate of the student
body, who will present a platform
of “A Chicken in Every Pot, A Broad
in Every Bed.”

Speaking of platforms, it struck us
that it could be quite amusing to
delve into our archives and find the
platforms of Messrs. Nash, Faulk
and Kline. In fact, we did do that
and found, that like all good up-
standing politicians, they did not do
all that they promised.

Nash presented to the student body
a seven-point platform which stressed
as its goal to make W&L a “great
University” as opposed to being a
purely “good University.” There has
not seemed to be a great earth-shak-

a member of the Executive Commit-'

refrain from publishing Mr. Preston's
letter, for reasons having to do with
the Honor System (but not involving
Mr. Preston, and not involving any-
body connected with the Ring-tum

System matters is something in which
this newspaper feels it has no right
to involve itself. With the assurance
that a menrber of the Executive Com-
mittee knew of the situation (he being
the person who informed us of it), we
presumed it would be taken care of
appropriately; and therefore we de-
ferred publication of the Preston letter

We don't buy that. The Friday Edi-
tion not only saw Mr. Preston’s letter;
the Friday Edition set that letter in
type March 1, and then decided for
whatever reasons (perhaps the same
as the Tuesday Edition’s reasons?)
not to publish it. The two Editions of
this newspaper are entirely separate,
editorially; and saying “The Friday
Edition can not be held responsible
for the actions or policies of the
Tuesday Edition” does not sufficiently
explain why, after the letter had been

set in type by the same Friday Edition |

that “would have been happy to print
his letter.” the Friday Edition failed

He urged “the setting up of a ‘Press

meetings. This would include a repre-
sentative from each of the fraternities,
the Gaines Society, independents not
affiliated with the Gaines Society, and

fallen into obscurity.

on. Just to be sure the whimsical
cigarette-burn comment remains
whimsey, ashtray-stands will be pro-
vided in great abundance.

This reporter took a quick and
casual little mental journey through
the magnificent, impressive floor-plans
and interior-decorating-samples — yes-
terday, courtesy of the Student Cen-
ter Planning Committee. We were
struck (in only the most favorable
sense) by—among many, many others
—these random highlights:

The E, C. Room, It will have its
own separate entrance so the Center
won't have to be closed during trials
(they’ve thought of nearly everything
we've never had before). The carpet
there has a red and rich, rich olive-
green pattern; the walls are a luxuri-
ous beige burlap-like textured linen.

It will have a gigantic semi-circular
desk for formal meetings of the E. C.,
and seats for 30 or so spectators. The
four offices, which will double when
necessary aS witness-rooms, are com-
fortably but not extravagantly fur-
nished.

The Main Lounge. Three brass
chandeliers catch one’s interest im-
mediately. This place will be rampant
with overstuffed chairs and daven-
ports, like an English club, and is
going to be very formally, very richly
decorated, mostly in deep reds and
blues.

The tavern. A_ real, you're-not-
kidding Andy-Capp type bar with
stools and standing space; 21 solid
wood tables that the Hill doesn’t care
whether you carve upon or not; 10
or so booths; with fabric covering on
the walls, dark royal blue with bright
red gamecocks here and there (also
fabric, of course)—and this will be
the biggest room in the Center, big-
ger than even the new room at the
cy

The games room. Down a half-
flight of stairs from the tavern, the
“games room” (euphemism for card-
parlor-and-pool-hall) will contain five
pool tables and all equipment, two
ping-pong tables and three card tables.
The room will be attended whenever
it’s open, and there is some thought
being given to the possibility of charg-
ing a nominal sum for a rack (cloths
are expensive and have to be replaced
twice a year). This room, by the way,
is in the basement, where the book
store used to be when the Co-op was
over in that neck of the woods,

There's more. A_ grand student-
activities meeting room on the sec-
ond floor, behind a number of offices
that will be shared by the various
sanctioned organizations—the Calyx,
perhaps; maybe the Ring-tum Phi
business manager, and so on. And a
maze of other rooms and places, too
numerous to describe.

The whole place will be air-condi-

Is Stolen Here
At Lee Chapel

Nothing is sadder than a tree with-
out leaves except for a flagpole with-
out a flag, and that has been the case
at Washington and Lee for the past
four months. The leaves are return-
ing, but the flagpole at the head of
Lee Chapel parking lot has been flag-
less since the flag disappeared before
Christmas holidays.

The ROTC depariment has ad-
ministered the raising and lowering of
the flag every day for several years;
but because the flag is now missing,
when a new flag is received the
Maintenance Department will assume
the duty.

While not necessarily blaming WAL
students, ROTC officials believe the
absconding of the flag is a “black
eye’ for the school. And if this a
prank it is an expensive one, as the
flag was storm-proof and cost well
over $100.

The last reported raising of the flag
was on December 16 and it is be-
lieved it was taken that day.

centers of Europe, the capitol city,
and thus the seat of most government
agencies, and the communications and
transport center of France (all roads
lead to Paris).

Out of Control

The growth of Paris is as it ever
has been—out of control. Cars jam
the sireets for most of the working
day—one day iast fall there was mas-
sive tie-up near the Etoile from neon
to 6 p.m. some cars were promenad-
ing with the pedestrians along the
sidewalk. others were abandoned in
mid-siream in favor of a cool glass
of wine. The papers were estimating
a number above which the quantity
of ‘voitures’ in town could not rise—
something like 450,000: they estimat-
ed that after this point no car would
be moving—all activity would halt,
like at absolute zero. They finally got
some gas to the fellow who had run
dry, however, and it gradually thinned
oul.

Making Space

Everybody who is anybody, and a
lot who aren't. lust for a ear, or if
they have one, for a more powerful
one. It is said, with some degree of
accuracy. that a Frenchman cares
for his car first and then his wife
The combination of this lust with the
ever increasing ability of Parisians to
afford tuxuries yields an impossible
competition for parking places, Half
the drivers of the never-ending
plethora of cars are undoubtedly ex-
tremely angry individuals who have
been looking for a space for the past
45 minutes

The ingenious driver often solves
this problem in a most efficient way

if there isn’t a space, he makes one

Baseballers Open Season;
Bow To Ohio U., 8-1

By LARRY HILLIARD

Two Ohio University pitchers held
Washington and Lee to three hits and
posted an 8-1 vic-
tory in a practice
game yesterday.
The game was the
final scrimmage for
the Generals be-
fore their season
opener with Castle-
ton State College

 

of Vermont on
Friday.
The Generals

opened the scor-
ing in the bottom
of the second. With one out, Herbert
McCrystal singled and Charlie Freret
walked. After Jack Baizley had fore-
ed Freret for the second out, the
Generals pulled off a double steal,
with Baizley moving to second and
McCrystal scoring.

Ohio U. took the lead in the fourth
when the W&L pitcher, co-Captain
Bill Rasmussen, encountered control
difficulty. A walk, hit batsman, walk,
single, and sacrifice fly accounted for
three runs. The visitor's eleven hit
attack added two runs in the fifth,
two in the seventh, and one in the

Coach Lyles

ninth. Meanwhile, the Generals could
/manage only

two more safties; a
single by Freret and a double by
McCrystal.

Three hurlers

toiled for WAL,

| Rasmussen allowed five runs and six
‘hits in five innings, Ed Mitchell two

runs and four hits in three frames,

and Don Bock a run and a hit in
the ninth.

Coach Joe Lyles feels that the
excellent competition provided by
Ohio should prepare the Generals for
the regular season. He was pleased
with the team’s defensive work, but
added that the Generals have to im-
prove their hitting. “We need more
mental concentration at the plate.”

Friday’s home game will begin at
3:15. Afterwards, the team will de-
part for its Florida trip. The players
are giving up their Spring vacation—
hopefully a large number of students
will give up one afternoon to come
up to Smith Field and root for the
team.

Rumor of Football
Transfer Proves To

Be Un-verifiable

Recently the Ring-tum Phi sports

staff learned of a rumor thal was
spreading throughout certain circles

of WAL: that the above-pictured
athlete from Arizona State was con
sidering transfering to WAL. Of
course our initial response was cla
tion, for it has been many a yeat
since the Generals boasted a 61",
260 pound defensive middle guard
who possesses 18’, inch biceps. In
addition to his football talents he also
boasted a win over Granville Liggens
in regular season wrestling last year

However, we were cautious, and

| decided to check this matter through

the powers that be. The result was

{| HICKMAN’S ESSO |

Ball Performs In Nationals

Billy Ball scored a substantial 16th
and 17th in the 100- and 200-yard
backstroke events last weekend at the
college division NCAA swimming
championships at Atlanta.

In the 100-yard backstroke event,
Ball had a time of 57.78 seconds (an
electronic timer) which is his best

time ever. Ball came in 16th out of |

the 50 swimmers entered in this event.
The winning time was 52.9, and Ball
missed All-American status (finishing
in the top 12) by .25 seconds as the
twelth-place time was 57.53 seconds.
This was a good second faster than
Ball’s 58.6 performance in the CAC.

Ball scored a 2:09.5 in the 200-
yard backstroke, bettering his previous
best time by 21% seconds. This is
faster than Ball’s 2:11.9 time which
set a new CAC record. Ball finished
17th out of 42 entries and again miss-
ed All--American by .8 seconds while
the winning time in this event was a
fast 2:01.0.

The 400-yard individual medley
team of Billy Ball, Pat Costello, David
Kympton and Ross Forman did not
fare as well. They had a 3:57.6 time
while the highest qualifying time was
3:47.0. In fact, they were even above
their CAC conference record time of
3:54.5.

This was the final event in a swim-

| ming season that saw the Generals

capture the College Athletic Con-
ference swimming championship, and

 

Billy Ball

an excellent 6-2 season with a vic-
tory over West Virginia University.
Coach Stearns has high hopes for
next year’s team, as there will be a
meeting of the swimmers tomorrow
to elect their captain for next year,
The only seniors being graduated are
the two co-captains, Pat Costello and
Noel Clinard. Clinard provided many
points with his steady diving through-

Pictman Leads Offense As W&L

Lacrosse Team Stuns Dartmouth

By BUZZ PACOCHA

Washington and Lee’s varsity la-
crosse team defeated a ragged Dart-
mouth squad in a scrimmage yester-
day by a 6-4 score. The Generals’
scoring was well divided with Tom
Pittman leading the way with two
goals and one assist.

Coach Szlassa was well pleased with
the Generals’ performance, especially
with the work of Pittman and Chew,
hoth of whom moved well in their
attack positions. Sziasa also noted the
fine g=me turned in by Dave Johnson
in the goal, and the job of “riding”
done by the W&L attackmen who
kept Dartmouth defense from moving

Szlasa expects his team to perform
well this season, hoping to catch a
strong Hofstra team off guard on
Saturday. Co-captains Griffin and
Stewart provide strong leadership and
lots of hustle, while the injured Bart
Goodwin's return is expected to shore
up the midfielders,

This year’s schedule is a typically
rough one, with much stronger com-
petition expected from the three ACC

a new rule-change in that conference

Pat Costello is ending an outstand-
ing season as the team’s breaststroker.
Costello was defeated only once all

stroke. He now holds the CAC record
in the 200-yard breaststroke.

Of the swimmers traveling to At-

They were unable to go for various

‘The lady (man?) doth protest too much’

 

The silent advocates of peace left their traditional home in front of the Evans Dining Hall in their most recent
vigil. They paraded themselves through downtown Lexington. Assorted townsmen were quite amused at W&L’s
‘hippies’ and wondered why Martin Luther King was not there to lead the civil rights parade.

Our latest count credits these mongers of peace with two very silent vigils. But even though they have not, as of
yet, started any rioting, the presence of the 30 or so pacifists of the student body and the faculty has tied up the
traflic of sojourning students traveling back form lunch.

Would that Lady Bird would sign up for a ‘silent’ vigil, and that we could be so lucky as to keep her that way.

The Committee also
hundred questionnaires to prominent
Republicans: congressmen, senators,
and state delegation chairmen. The
responses to these questionnaires have
also helped the Platform Committee
determine likely issues.

Last week, sub-committee hear-
ings took place. At these meetings,
students who had been in touch with
their state delegations appeared be-
fore the various sub-committees and
presented their respective states’ views
on platform issues. The sub-commit-
tees then compared their findings with
the testimony of these witnesses. Sub-
committee chairmen then presented
their material to the Platform Com-
mittee this week.

A first draft will be drawn up
over vacation by the Platform Com-

the month of April. The final draft

Solutions To The Crisis

The government is entertaining sev-

building roads that terminate in the
Seine river, or burning all delinqu-
