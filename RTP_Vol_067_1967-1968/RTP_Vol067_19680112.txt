Members of the Washington and

Ihe Young Republicans then fol-

The Young Republicans
brought some girls from Sweet Briar
College to Lexington to hear Nixon
speak.

Nixon Outlines Goals, Problems Of U.S.;
Remains Noncommittal OnfHis Candidacy

Former Vice President Richard M.
Nixon was the guest speaker at the
Omicron Delta Kappa leadership fra-
ternity “tapping” day Thursday.

In a speech delivered in Doremus
Gymnasium, Nixon cited current
domestic problems which have led
to violence in cities and curbs in
American foreign spending.

Without an American anti-com-
munist stand in the world, Nixon
told the audience, other nations in the
free world could not “afford the
luxury of neutrality.”

“America needs the vision, the dis-
sent, the constructive action this gen-
eration will provide for in the years
ahead,” Nixon said to students in
closing his remarks.

Nixon fielded questions, mostly
political, from students following his
speech.

Dien . ‘i . +

Tuesday night the Executive Com-
mittee voted 9-0 to recommend that
the Southern Collegian be resub-
sidized under the conditions of the
motion introduced by Wick Vellines,
senior representative.

Steve Saunders, editor of the maga-
zine which has been an off-campus
publication since 1966, said that only
effective policies of the Publications
Board are needed to maintain the
necessary standards of good taste.

The main points of the proposal
are as follows:

1. The Publications Board will
choose the editor from written
application after a faculty ad-
viser (Mr. H. Robert Huntley,
assistant professor of English)
has limited the number to no
less than two applicants;

2. The magazine's renewal of funds
will be on a yearly basis;

3. The new editor will outline the
magazine's format each year to
the faculty,

Saunders urged the Publications

Board to “control more stringently

said, “Third party candidates always
look better in the spring than in the
fall.”

On the question of the future of
the U. S. in Europe, he said the
fundamental new approach to Ameri-
can European relations would be
economic self interest. The military
future of NATO, Nixon said, is “very
much in doubt.”

Peace in the Middle East will be
possible if the U. S. and other powers
see that Israel maintains a balance of
power against the aggressive nations
in that area. Nixon also cited the re-
armament of Arab nations by the
Soviet Union.

Nixon further suggested that the
U. S. halt all economic aid to the
United Arab Republic until it changes
its aggressive policies in the Mid-East.

the University’s sanction of the Col-
legian would assure its standards and
solvency.

Saunders also reported that the

is chairman, still needs about $2000
to finance its operations. To this end,
he is assessing each state delegation

in response to a question, is to “win
something,” Nixon said.

If he becomes a candidate, he said
this could be done by winning as
many primaries as possible.

The Republican Party, Nixon said,
has a “better than even chance” to
win the presidency in November
against the Democratic nominee, who-
ever he is.

On the credibility gap, Nixon said
a great number of Americans do not
believe the government. But a more
serious problem, he added, is that
“the enemy in North Vietnam and
the Soviets and Chinese have some

doubts about the determination of
the United States to see this (the war
in Vietnam) through.”

Nixon then repeated his statement
that he would make no statement
which might lead Hanoi to delay any
peace efforts until after the election
in November. The U. S. should pre-
sent a united front to the world on
the war in Vietnam.

Nixon flew into the Roanoke air-
port late Thursday morning. His visit
at W&L was limited to a speech in
Doremus Gymnasium. Immediately
following his speech and question

 

period, Nixon left the campus.

 

Camera crews from all three major

television networks were on hand for

Nixon's speech. However, only ABC-TV showed the speech on its 6:30 p.m.
newseast that night. The film showed Nixon shaking hands with Acting-Presi-
dent William Pusey and then showed Nixon answering a question on improv-
ing his “loser’s image.” A closing comment by the reporter allowed several

students to make their television debuts.

The ‘Collegian’ Again

If the founders of The Southern Collegian one hundred
years ago had foreseen all the trouble their offspring was going
to cause, they would have undoubtedly killed it on the spot.
In fact, everyone assumed that it was thoroughly dead after
March 1966, when the faculty cut off its funds and university
approval, thereby effectively banishing it from the W&L
scene. Not that anyone really cared: ‘The South’s Most
Maligned Magazine” had come a long way from the literary
journal it had been in 1868, and thoroughly deserved abolition.

Still, old institutions die hard, and the Southern Collegian
stripped of all its associations with the University—has ling-
ered on under private management for the past two years.
Now, in its hundredth year, it is making a bid for a new lease
on respectability, assisted last Tuesday night by a unanimous
EC resolution advising that the University once again subsidize
the publication.

Mindful of the Collegian’s past troubles with sex, sadism,
and satire, the resolution provides for four checks on the
content of a new Collegian:

(1) The Publications Board will choose the editor
from written application after a faculty adviser
(probably from the English department) has
limited the number to no less than two candi-
dates.

(2) The magazine’s renewal of funds will be on a
yearly basis.

(3) The new editor will outline the magazine's
format each year to the faculty.

Underlying these points is the assumption that the Publica-
tions Board (which consists of the editors and business man-
agers of the Ring-tum Phi, the Calyx, and Ariel, plus two
faculty members) will exercise a close supervision over any
objectionable elements in the Collegian, just as it presently
does over all student publications.

The EC’s action is, of course, only a recommendation. It
remains for the faculty to come to a final decision on the
matter of restoring University subsidization. In doing so, we
hope it will take into consideration the following points:

oe kK

The continuing existence of the shadow Collegian over
the past two years argues for the presence of some feeling
on campus in favor of maintaining a campus magazine. Further,
the Collegian of the past two years has been refreshingly free
from the hard-core pornography which characterized the
Hairy Collegian, despite the fact that there have been no
other controls upon its content than the discretion and taste
of the staff. A “clean” Collegian is possible.

The old Collegian got out of hand because it was
permitted to do so. The Publications Board in theory possessed
the same powers of censure over it as over any other student
publication, but in fact chose not to exercise this power over
an institution whose character had gradually become fixed
by custom. Any new Collegian, apart from voluntary self-
discipline on the part of the staff, would be subject to the
same rigorous supervision which the Publication Board has
always effectively exercised over, for example, the Ring-tum

Phi.

The Publications Board’s censure would be given muscle

by the EC’s suggestion that the magazine’s renewal of funds |

be on a vearly basis ( pornt number two above). If the maga-

vine staff were to ignore the reprimands of the Publication | *
| that professors who are truly devoted |

Board consistently, it could be reminded that its existence 1s
only provisional.

Given these safeguards against mishandling of the maga-
i.e., a firm Publications Board, financial control in the
the EC’s other pro-

ine,
hands of the faculty, and self-discipline
posals (one and three above) would seem to be unnecessary
is well as foolish. Concerning selection of the editor from
candidates approved by a faculty member, it should be obvious
that this would be a potentially dangerous situation, virtually
superseding the Publications Board as it does. The faculty and
idministration of Washington and Lee have not felt it necessary
in the past to interfere directly or indirectly in the selection of
sudent editors and officers, and it hardly seems necessary to
begin now, even in the case of that bugbear, the Collegian.
As

format each year, we find that impractical if not downright

the inclination to examine every issuc ot the Collegian in

necessary——would again be the Publications Board

Wi commend the Et for encouraging the re establishment
of the Southern Collegian, although we hardly agree with the

its recommendations to the faculty And we recommend to the

Mr. Latture Relives ODK Founding

By REED BYRUM

As Omicron Delta Kappa, National
Leadership Fraternity for College
Men, inducted its fifty-fourth class
of initiates, one man in_ particular
watched with an especial interest in
his heart and mind: he is indeed
one of the original founders of the
Alpha Circle of ODK, which is locat-
ed upon the Washington and Lee
campus, Rupert Nelson Latture.

Along with fifteen others, includ-
ing members of the student body and
faculty, Mr. Latture was of primary
importance in establishing the ideals
and principles of what is now the
most respected and honored leader-
ship fraternity in the nation.

duction for this season. The trio,
which has received enthusiastic re-
sponse all over Europe an dthe United
States, offered an outstanding selction
of duo and trio repertoire for piano,

Ihe performance was characterized
throughout by the flawless technical
skill and precision of the artists. Dif-

lessly, and, at the same time, the
players managed to convey a sense
of musical warmth and feeling ofr
their music.

The program opened with Mozart's
“Trio in E flat Major” (viola, clarinet,
and piano), followed by Debussy’s
“Premiere Rhapsody” for clarinet and
piano. The first half of the program
ended with “Suite de Concert (1936)"
(violin, clarinet, and piano) by Milh-
aud, an unusual selection which pro-
vided a_ spirited contrast to the

David And Lisa

By CHIP HARRIS

“David and Lisa,” an award win
ning film Frank Perry,
will be shown this Sunday at 6:30
p.m. in duPont Auditorium. The film
is the third in a series of six notable
productions presented through “Focus
on the Flm,” a program made possible
through the University Federation of
Christian Concern.

The film, which premiered in 1963,
concerns the lives of two mentally dis-
turbed teenagers staying at a private
institution for mentally ill high-school-
age students outside Philadelphia.

David, a highly intelligent
brought up by domineering and
aspiring mother and a social mis
fited, dominated father, is so fearful
of death that he breaks down if any
one much touches him. Lisa
on the other hand, is afraid to con-
front reality, having apparently lack-
ed any form of parental love during
her younger years. Consequently, she
hides behind a of childlike

The difference is probably due to the
problem of balance between the bril-

Blue Annexes Tenth Straight Win

 

Generals Smother Bri

By THUNDER THORNTON

Washington and Lee’s tall, talented
Generals handed Bridgewater an 86-
74 defeat at Doremus Gymnasium
rhursday night, and thereby strength-
ened their standing atop the Virginia
Small College League totem-pole. By
winning, W&L saw its mark raised
to 12-1, and kept their state record
unblemished.

The Eagles, a solid team that re-
fused to let the Generals pull away
until late in the game, got strong
scoring from Eddie Cook, Jim Upper-
man, and Rick Wampler, but it was
not destined to be enough. The home
team performed excellently before a
large crowd, and although a few cold
spells and turnovers by W&L allowed
Bridgewater to mount a few come-
backs from time to time ,the Gen-

“Magic of Old”

Pacing the victors was Mel Cart-
wright, who treated the fans to the
“magic” of old. Working in a low
post for the most part, the sophomore
star whirled past his defenders with
the fluid moves that marked his fresh-
man season. Despite a finger injury

lonight in Doremus gymnasium the
Generals’ wrestling team will attempt
to even its record at 3-3 against Wil-
lam and Mary, after Tuesday night's
trouncing of a weak RPI squad, 26-
10, which was almost identical with
last year’s 25-15 win,

According to wrestling coach, Dick
Miller, the W&M _ Indians should

prove tougher than RPI. Last year the -

Generals won 22-16 but the Indians
have improved considerably since
then.

At this time, the Generals are

hampered by injuries. Co-captain Don
O'Hare is out for the season with a
punctured eardrum, Whit Morrill will
miss this meet due to a cauliflower
ear but will be back in the lineup
next week. Waugh Crigler is not yet

a good job but came back too late,

one-handed to tally 27 points and pull
in 12 rebounds,

With Cartwright leading the way,
the Generals shot out to a 16-4 early
lead and then watched Upperman
and Co, whittle it down. The Eagles
were forced to shoot from outside
over the tight W&L defense, but they
made enough long ones to cut the
deficit to 39-36 at the intermission.
Upperman, the visitors’ big man, was
responsible for 13 points, keeping
pace with Cartwright and keeping his
team in the game.

The second half saw the home
forces steadily pull away and avoid
the long cold spell that would make
a Bridgewater comeback possible. The
Generlas displayed their strength in-
side with Cartwright, Mike Neer, and
Mal Wesselink working effectively at
both ends of the court. The Eagles
began finding it tougher to get a
good shot and almost impossible to
get a second one. Washington and
Lee moved out to a nine point spread
at 47-38, watched it melt to 49-45,
and then zoomed off to a sixteen point
bulge at 68-52 on a brilliant drive by
guard John Carrere.

The Eagles’ man-to-man _ broke

in Tuesday's win over RPI,

Alford, the Buccaneer's
69” center, should provide a stiff
challenge for the Generals’ Mike
Neer. Alford is only a mediocre
shooter, but his rebounding has been

Charles

instrumental in ECC’s success. This
will mark the first time Neer has
faced a competent big man; and

the resulting match-up will be well
worth watching.

The big weakness of this Pirate
team lies on defense. ECC has had
terrible difficulties in containing their
opponents. At the end of their first
six games, they ranked in the
Southern Conference in defense. This
is primarily due to a lack of cohesion,
however, as only two of the starting

last

five lettered last year. One of the
pair, forward Vince Colbert, honor
able mention All-Conference last
year, is beginning to lend that needed

Stop Eaglettes

Coach Tom Davies finally saw his
ball-control offense jell last night as
Washington and Lee’s Baby Gen-
erals clipped Bridgewater’s Eaglettes
65-51 in Doremus Gymnasium.

This was the Little Blue’s second
straight win of a season that opened
with four consecutive losses, and it
avenged an earlier loss to the same
Bridgewater five.

“Defense won the game for us,”
Coach Davies commented. “We held
their two top scorers to a total of
eight points, and one of them was
held scoreless.”

Four of the W&L freshmen posted
double-figure scoring marks for the
contest. They were led by Rich Mur-
ray, who had 15 points. Following
him were Mike Truta with 13, Neil
Robinson with 12, and Bill Bauer
with 10 markers.

Balanced scoring has been a key

The Generals’ performance should
serve as a warning to prospective foes.
Washington and Lee handled the
Eagles, who were coming off a high
scoring, big margin win over Lynch-
burg, with the dexterity of a champ-
ion. W&L shot a healthy 54% from
the floor, due largely to the fact that
the pinpoint passes of Kline, Carrere,
and Cartwright earned a lot of easy
baskets. On the other hand, Bridge-
water could manage only a 34% mark
against the Big Blue, with a majority

proposal designed to fulfill the parts
of the Self-Study dealing with health
and safety. Earlier, the idea of re-
quired inspection of apartments had
been proposed. Both the EC and the
IFC opposed this and formed a sub-
committee consisting of Nash, Ellis
Zahras, William Schildt, and Peter
Kintz.

This group drafted a new plan in
which W&L would establish such an
investigation service and would print
a list of those dwellings inspected
and approved. However, inspection is
not mandatory and must be both
requested by the student, his parents,
or the landlord, and must be per-
mitted by the landlord.

The EC, in passing this motion
9-0, unanimously agreed that it both
fulfilled the University’s responsibility
and insured the students of free
choice.

The writer of the letter also stated
that he disagreed “with the majority
of Mr. Nixon's political views.” In
addition, he said he would welcome
a student peace reaction if directed
“within the boundaries of good taste.”
This includes discussing the issues in-
teligently instead of resorting to “pro-
pogating offensive literature.”

A number of student publications
and WLUR had tried to obtain in-
terviews with Nixon, but his tight

' schedule at W&L did not allow time.

Several posters were put up on
campus by students. One read “Nixon

Turnovers and Charity Misses

Turovers in the secnd-half, and a
so-so night from the foul line marred
the home team’s performance some-
what. While the Generals could net
only 16 for 26 from the charity line,
Bridgewater cashed in on 16 for 21.
Washington and Lee outgoaled Brige-
water from the field 35-29, and that
was the point spread.

Joining Cartwright in double figures
for W&L were Neer with 21, Carrere
with 10, and Wesselink with 10.
Upperman paced the losers with 21,
while Cook and Wampler added 17
apiece.

against Bridgewater may not overly
impress Coach Sonny Allen and his

Greek letters. I then presented this
to the group at our next meeting,
and it was readily accepted.

R-+t P: At its conception did you
ever perceive that ODK would eventu-
ally become of such national signific-
ance? Also, how did you branch out
to your other 114 chapters?

Latture: Neither I nor the other
member of the society ever realized
the national importance involved in
our founding of ODK; no one be-
lieved that ODK would extend into
over one hundred colleges and uni-
versities throughout the country.

Latture: The conception of ODK has

guidelines, with perhaps the aspira-
tions being more ambitious and the
academic requirements higher. It still
brings together the campus leaders,
distinguishing them for their service
and employing them to solve problems
of campus concern.

A View From The Footbridge

(Continued on page 4)
it was to watch W&L’s second string
trounce UNC Charlotte by 31 points?
Granted, there has been some excite-
ment, an example being last night's
Bridgewater contest, but, on the
whole, the W&L student body has
not seen the caliber of competition
which most want to see so as to
answer that all important question
that is floating around campus these
days, “Just how good are we?”

It is this columnist’s opinion that
the Generals are good, and in the
course of the following two months,
in places like Greenville, North Car-
olina, and Norfolk and Salem, Vir-
ginia, this observation will be proven
true. This, though, will be only small
consolation to the W&L student body,
who, though seeing home victories,
will be seeing few, if any, mean-
ingful ones.

Obviously, nothing can be done
this season to remedy the situation.
That was irrevocably fixed last spring
when the powers-that-be in the
Athletic Department arranged this
year’s schedule. I have a few sug-
gestions, though, that I believe would
immensely improve the outlook for
the student body in the realm of
basketball spectatorship.

Over the years, Washington and Lee
has developed healthy rivalries with
several other Virginia small colleges.
Only one of them, Roanoke, appears
on the schedule this year. I feel that

improvement.

Saturday night should prove a stiff
test for the Generals. W&L has not
yet faced a team of East Carolina's

calibre and the game is on ECC’s|%

home court. The Pirates have the
height advantage and an explosive

offense. In the words of Coach Tom :

Quinn before the season, “This could
be the most surprising and exciting
team that ever donned the ‘Jolly
Roger’.” Washington and Lee's 12-1
record and convincing margins of

victory are nothing to sneer at, though, | ¥

and it could be the Pirates who'll
be surprised.

Macon, Hampden-Sydney, and Roa-
noke would be advantageous to all
the schools involved, and would
greatly enhance W&L’s seasons to
come. Nothing picks up school spirit
like traditional rivals, and I feel it’s
about time these were exploited on
the basketball court.

Secondly, I believe a path has to
be cleared between Lexington, Vir-
ginia, and Monteagle, Tennessee,
home of the Sewanee Purple Tigers.
There is no reason that the old-
standing feud that exists between the

David and Lisa
Shown Sunday

(Continued from page 2)

but striking scene of her clinging to
a statue of a mother fondly embrac-
ing her child in the Philadelphia
Museum. From this and Lisa’s over-
all behavior the viewer must form
his own conclusions.

This contrast of presentation serves
to underscore the contrast of their
mental disturbances and backgrounds,
and the resulting salvation they find
in each other is just paradoxical
enough to really reach the viewer.

Kiev Dulla is excellent in portray-
ing a withdrawn, perpetually fearful
David, overcoming the difficulty in
changing from one instant a relatively
complacent David to seconds later a
violent, extremely perturbed, David.
Lisa, also a difficult character to
portrary, is played by Janet Margolin,
who is equally adapted to the role.

Few black and white films, or for
that matter, few color films, ever

 

reach the level of films like “David
and Lisa.” “David and Lisa” is well
worth the trek to duPont Hall Sun-
day night.

 

two schools should be limited in
basketball to the luck-of-the-draw
chance that they might meet each
year. The W&L-Sewanee game should
become a regularly scheduled annual
affair.

A Shift in Direction

Finally, I propose a “shift in di-
rection” as far as basketball schedul-
ing is concerned. Let’s get out of the
Carolinas and into the Baltimore-D.C.
area. The Wesleyans and the Metho-
dists aren’t worth the expense of
traveling that far (one game on the
recent Carolina trip was played be-
fore 50 people in a high school gym).
Catholic U., Towson, Johns Hopkins,
and Mt. St. Mary’s—small colleges
all—are the kinds of teams the Gen-
erals should be playing and playing
regularly.

It doesn’t take major college opposi-
tion to make for exciting basketball.
Winston-Salem, Evansville, and Ken-
tucky Wesleyan play the game better
than most big schools in the nation.
The Washington and Lee student body
deserves to see its team matched
against the caliber of small-college
Opposition that makes for champ-
ions. We have faith in our Generals.
Bring on the best!
