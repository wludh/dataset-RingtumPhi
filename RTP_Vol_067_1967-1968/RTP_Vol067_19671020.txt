Ah, Elections

While we were watching the progress of freshman elections
last week, it occurred to us that historians and sociologists may
be neglecting a great mine of historical and sociological in-
formation by not devoting their time and typewriters to studies
of collegiate political campaigns. Every year we get a new
“History of the Republican (or Democratic, or Socialist)
Party,” or an in-depth “Report Upon 1964 Electoral Voting
Patterns in Kaufman Co., Tex.” And yet, national and even
local elections are usually run with such a smooth profession-
alism that there is a depressing sameness and tameness about
them all. (It makes little difference, really, whether the candi-
date was supposed to have been born in a log cabin on the
Mississippi or in a log ranch house on the Pedernales.)

Nothing, on the other hand, is so lively as an amateur
production—especially an amateur election. By definition, it
involves no professionalism, which means you can always expect
surprises, last-minute reversals of fortune, thrills, incredible
blunders, occasional skullduggery, and above all, real inventi-
veness. The sort of thing you get in any college electoral
campaign. And, of course, among electoral campaigns the best
and the most worthy of study are undoubtedly freshman elec-
tions, when the amateurs are really amateurs.

Future historians of the decline and fall of American youth
would do well to pay more heed to the comparative history of
college elctions. The conduct and misconduct of elections,
the emphasis given to different positions and platforms in
different eras, and slogans which ornament every election,
might keep the doctoral theses coming for decades. How many
psychological studies could be drawn from such campaign
calls as “Grivit, Grivit’” (Spring 1967) or ‘‘(Candidate X)
for Apathy” (Fall 1967)? How many philosophical tracts
could be composed over the paradoxes of “Elect Henry C.
Hawk” (Fall 1967) ?

The whole history of the intellectual attitudes of W&L
students is almost summed up in the history of their elections.
It was one kind of freshman class which wrangled in 1910 over
who would be captain of the pushball team in the annual
sophomore-freshman pushball game (a very prestigious post).
It was quite a different kind of freshman class which in the
early 30’s used to elect the most unpopular “goat” in the class
to the presidency, parade him through the streets, and compel
him to address the mob from the balcony of the Robert E.
Lee Hotel or from the bar in McCrum’s Drug Store. And it
was another freshman class altogether which as recently as
1964 broke the “clique system’’ and ended a thirty years’ war
between two rival groups of fraternities.

Do we detect a note of progress there somewhere—from
pushball to clique-breaking? And while the romantics among
us may deplore the passing of the good old days of elections
here, when freshmen rioted in Lee Chapel (1950) and en-
raged janitors were sweeping up 750 campaign posters a day
from the floors of the dorm (1930), we might also take
comfort from the thought that student government has come
a long way in the direction of maturity and responsibility.

Letters To The Editor .. .

 

 

Yafass

lo The Editor
Dear Sir:

Have you ever heard the braying
of a Yafass? It resembles that of a
mule; the two animals are also alike
in planting their feet and defending

the status quo. They are different,
though. The Yafass often proposes
hilariously funny old approaches to

new problems.

Some entertaining reading awaits
you in a Yafass humor publication
modestly named “Truth” (obtained on
a northern campus). For some reason
(linguistic conservatism?), they coyly
prefer the Latin “Veritas.” This humor
publication strongly resembles and
may be a take-off on, another comic
newspaper also named “Truth”—in
that they both make ludicrously fan-
tastic statements in a perfectly serious
tone. Veritas at least equal Pravda
in this entertaining form of subtle wit.

Job Discrimination

In a current issue, there is an in-
genious proposal for preserving what
only a Yafass could consider a great
old American tradition worth keep-
ing: job discrimination. Their argu-
ment (2, 1, September 11, 1967, p. 3)
is:

“Liberals are forever claiming to
be the champions of the cause for
jobs for Negroes. Yet these same lib-
erals are calling for repeal of section
14B of the Taft-Hartley Act. Section
14B protects the right of a state to|
outlaw the union shop. The union)
shop requires that an employee join|
the union within 30 days after start-|
ing work. It is no secret that many|
labor unions discriminate with regard |
to race, yet liberals say that if a man}
is employed where there is

 

a union, |
he should be required to join, But if
the union refuses to accept Negroes, |
then the Negro will never be hired}
in the first place, thus losing out on}
a job.

“Conservatives on the other hand,
maintain that it is the right of an in-|
dividual to join or not join a union)
as he sees fit. We do not want section
14B repealed, Under the conserva-|
tive approach the Negro could take)
the job. he would not be
forced to join the umon a condi
tion of employment

because

as

The liberal approach, then, works
against the Negro, denying him his
right to work, whereas the conservative
method preserves individual integrity
by guaranteeing this vital right. So
the next time a liberal tells you how
over the Negro un
ask him about 148

Who indeed? Not the writers of
Veritas. This quotation points up a
frequent defect in the humor of
Veritas (frequent also in Pravda): The
tone is sometimes so sincere that you

have an unpleasant, fleeting impres-
sion that the writers actually believe

in the fantastic statements that they
make. The wit tends to wear a little
thin in spots; this is often the case
when Veritas deals with the Negro

question,

Whey is this so? It appears that here
they really have a genuine concern,
they have reason to fear that the
wish of Lester Maddox will be ful-

filled in reverse. If Negroes ever col-

lect on the century-old Federal
promise of “forty acres and a mule,”
since the resemblance between a
Yafass and a mule is so great, as
I pointed out in the beginning, it is
not improbable that many Negroes
will end up owning forty acres and
a Yafass!

In the meantime, let us enjoy the
Yafasses’ off-beat band of humor.

viously appearing in the Daily

Broadcast C omplaint

To The Editor of the Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

The purpose of this letter is to ex-
press my regrets concerning the broad-
cast of the Lafayete game last week
on WLUR. The play by play account
of the game was done excellenily.
However, most of the comments about
the game and the team were in very
poor taste. Mr. Lupton’s comments

| were a very bad representation for

WAL and would have been out of
place anywhere, let alone over the
radio,

I'm just thankful WLUR could be
heard only in this area. | hope that
the next game broadcast over WLUR
will be an improvement over last
week's.

Gill Campbell, ‘69

On Student Union

By PAUL ATWATER

Monday was the first day of con-
struction on the new building that will
join the present student union and
Evans dining hall, creating greatly ex-
panded facilities for student activity
and recreation. Removal of the tile
patio and large tree next to the dining
hall are but the first steps in the work
that is expected to be completed
around February of 1969, From. its
exterior appearance, the new addi-
tion will take the place of the col-
lonade that now connects the existing
building and will have a_ gabled
entrance with windows on either side.
Furthermore, the sidewalk will be in-
dented to allow passengers to be let
out and picked up from their cars
without hindering traffic.

Interior Features

Of the many interior features of the
building the most popular will no
doubt be the as of yet unnamed tavern
of the rathskellar variety, and the
recreation room with its billiard tables,
et. al. The “tavern” (the term that
the administration has dubbed it for
the present) will be located on a sub-
terranean level under the present
patio.

At the far end of the large room
(around 70 x 40 feet) there will be a
bar with the traditional stools and
bar rail. The answer to the question
you are all wondering about is “yes;”
beer (3.2) will be served there. Be-
sides its large area for dancing,
another feature of this wood panneled
room will be booths and tables sep-
arated from the dance area by a
partition of wood railings.

For added entertainment there will
be a juke box, piano, and possibly
television. The large dance area will
also be able to accomodate combos
(if there is enough student interest and
participation to financially support
one).

The recreation room will adjoin the
“tavern” and will take the place of
the old bookstore (a commendable
substitution). The other facilities of
this floor level are the Glee Club,
Brass Choir, and other music practice
rooms which will remain largely as

 

 

 

 

they are now. The present office of
the Calyx staff, however, will be
moved, most probably to the third
floor.

Second Story

The second story will show some
striking changes. The wall that sepa-
rates the lounge and television room
will be removed, thus making a very
large reception room which will have
any number of varied uses. Moving
further back into the building, the stu-
dent activity room that is adjacent to
the present patio will be converted into
a comfortable library and sitting room.
Behind this, the old Co-op will be a
room devoted to Executive Commit-
tee meetings and also serve as a
place for honor trials. There will be
constructed four small witness rooms
to the very rear of the building.

The new addition between the two
existing buildings on the present patio
level will be used as another student

Phi Delts in poor field position, but
led by quarterback Lou Paterno
(whose graying hair reminds the avid

moved out to operating territory be-

The SAE defense, sparked by mid-
dle guard Howard Capito, worked out
of a basic 3-3-2 defense to counter
the Phis’ shotgun-slot formations.
When Crosby sliced a punt out of

SAE’s seemed to be paydirt bound.

the trends in modern sculpture. He
said that one of the latest things is
to have the sculptor draw up plans
for his work, and then send them off
to a factory to have it made. Made
in this manner, the modern “primary
sculpture” shows no personal touch
at first. “Sculptures” of this type are
invariably done on a large scale and
are geometric-like structures, rather
than linear.

Hall prefers figurative sculptures,
| and emphasizes the distinction between
form and subject. He wants students
| to be able to see the world and dif-
ferent relationships clearly, and to be
sensitive to il.

He says it important for his
| students to have discipline and con-|] :
trol over what they do, but to be
imaginative; and above all—exciting.
| Mr. Hall's students will exhibit their
year’s work in a show to be pre-
sented in May.
| In the future Mr. Hall hopes to
| construct a small foundry at W&l
| so as to be able to conduct a class
| in casting, as well as sculpture.
