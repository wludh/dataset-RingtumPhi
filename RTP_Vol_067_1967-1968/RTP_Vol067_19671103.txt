Leading Actor Interviewed:
Discusses Role In New Play

By REED BYRUM

Laurence L. McConnell, a Sigma Chi from Atlanta, Georgia, pos-
sesses the unique distinction of being the first freshman ever to hold the
leading part in a Troubadour play. He is cast as Leon duPont, a man
vainly fighting society, in Boris Vian’s “The Empire Builders,” which is
representative of the threatre of the absurd,

The interview was very casual, taking place Thursday afternoon,
while Laurence was preparing for a special rehearsal because of the ab-
sence of a regular member of the cast. It began with iny asking him the
extent of his previous experiences in acting,

McConnell: My first formal participation was early in my high
school career in Oscar Wilde’s “In the Importance of Being
Ernest,” in which I played the role of a Dr. Chausable. He
was a type-cast character, being an elderly, well-meaning, yet
naive man, who had a minor part in the play. After this first
role, my interest grew rapidly, and I participated in three other
plays. Also, I helped to found a chapter of Thespians in my
high school, as the school theatrical group had no similar
honorary organization.

Byrum: Did you participate in any extracurricular acting or
speech contests while in secondary school?

McConnell: During the summer between my junior and senior
year, I went to a state-wide drama workshop and had roles in
two plays. As to forensics, I won the V.F.W. Voice of America
contest, which is designed to hear the adolescent views of Ameri-
can democracy, in the fifth district of Georgia, but lost to a
Columbus boy in the state finals.”

Byrum: Before entering Washington and Lee this past fall,
had you heard anything about the Troubs and their restrictive
physical plant?

McConnell; In April of 1965 I was visiting the campus and
came upon the theatre building, before its most recent re-
modeling. Mr. Lee Kahn, the director of the Troubs, greeted
me, and immediately we became involved in a conversation
concerning acting at W&L. I was not only impressed with
Mr. Kahn, but also with character of the plays which he was
anticipating to present.

Byrum: After learning that first you were awarded the lead
in the play and second that you were the first freshman to do
so, what was your reaction to receiving such honors?
McConnell: My initial response to being selected was one of
surprise and of almost bewilderment. However, I soon realized
that apparently others had faith in my abilities and knew that
I could handle the part.

Byrum: Laurence, you've told me much about your experience
in acting and your reaction to gaining the part, so now could
you tell me a little about your actual part in the play?

McConnell: I play the part of Leon duPont, the father of a
family, and he is extremely fearful of facing the adversity
and pain of society. Therefore, he retreats into the confines
of his home, the first act begining with his transferring of his
family to the attic of the house. He is fighting something
which he is unable to comprehend and thus effectively com-
bat. Leon takes his wrath upon a bandaged schmurtz, the
German word for pain, and constantly stabs and beats it. In
itself the striking of the schmurtz, representing Leon’s vain
efforts to combat society, brings in an almost entirely new
aspect to the play.

Byrum: How do you go about your part, are you caught up in
it or does it not motivate you?

McConnell: | personally like the role quite a bit, but I couldn't
say that I'm completely ‘caught up’ in it. I feel that an actor
loses his control over the part if he does this. He indeed must

The Exam Schedule

On Monday, the Committee on Courses and Degrees will
present to the faculty its plan for the reform of the examination
schedule, the details of which were released to the Executive
Committee and to the Ring-tum Phi yesterday.

As the Tuesday Edition pointed out in its last issue, the
reforms are painfully needed and long overdue; the system
was last overhauled ten years ago to fit conditions which in many
cases no longer exist, while new conditions have arisen which
were not then foreseen. Obviously, the Committee on Courses
and Degrees has not been unaware of these facts, and it is
extremely pleasing to see that it has taken firm action to do
something about them.

The program, if passed, will not entirely fulfill the hopes
which the EC raised with its proposals on Oct. 10, which would
have given the student some freedom of choice as to when he
could take his examinations. Presumably, the committee came
to the conclusion that this would create too much chaos for
the professors faced with the job of grading under these condi-
tions, and this is probably a valid conclusion. On the other
hand, the committee did at least solve one of the major prob-
lems pointed out by the EC: the fact that all too many students
every year have to take three examinations within two days.
Any upperclassman can recall some particularly harrowing
example of what that means from his own experience. If the
new system goes through, this will all be ended for the vast
majority of students; the worst that could happen to most
would be a string of exams, one on each of five days.

We hope the plan passes Monday. It is a far, far better
thing than we have had before, and the Committee on Courses
and Degrees has our most sincere thanks for drawing it up.
We also hope, however, that the new plan will not be con-
sidered necessarily definitive, and that other plans providing for
freedom of choice and other reforms will not be disregarded
in the future.

Dance Board Not At Fault

Artists Cancel

and blame last minute cancella-
tions On poor management, agents call
at the last minute and make feeble
excuses why their clients will not
make it.

At an interview with Dance Board
President Paul Brower, and Faculty
| Advisors Drs. Delos D. Hughes and
Charles F. Phillips (see picture at
left), some most enlightening revela-
tions were uncovered.

Say

The Dance Board had signed con-
tracts, and had paid to the per-
formers one-half of the contract
prices, with Otis Redding, Wilson
Pickett, and Jr. Walker prior to the
sale of Dance Plans early in Sep-
tember. These contracts, among
other things, call for the perform-
ers to be at the gymnasium by 5
p.m. of the day of the scheduled
concert. The Dance Board did not
misrepresent the signing of these
performers to the student body;
Dr. Phillips has these signed con-
tracts in his possession,

On Friday, October 20th, the Dance
Board received a phone call from
its agent (Stan Rubin of the College
Entertainment Agency) in New York,
claiming that Otis Redding was in a
hospital suffering from a polyp and
that his doctor has ordered him to
rest for at least six weeks. Dr. Phil-
lips called the hospital and verified
the report. As a result, the Dance
Board found substitute entertainment;
a difficult task with only seven days’
notice.

A week later, on Friday, October
27th, the Dance Board received a
phone call from Rubin claiming that
Jr. Walker was cancelling his sched-
uled performance the next night be-
cause his organ player had lost his
passport in London and was unable
to fly back to the States with the
group. Jr. Walker said that he re-
fused to perform without the organ
player. Board President Brower offer-
ed to obtain an organ player, but
again Walker refused. This concella-
tion clearly violates the contract, and
the Dance Board is taking steps to
recover both the initial one-half con-
tract price, and an amount for dam-
ages. The Board will attempt to work
through the Musician's Union, which
can fine Walker and turn the money

Booters Crack VMI And EM In Midweek Wins

Team Sharp In 3-0 Victory

By SHELDON MILLER

On Thursday W&L’s soccer team
broke out of a slump and defeated
Eastern Mennonite 3-0 on the Gen-
eral’s home field. Eastern Mennonite,
sporting several foreign players, car-
ried a 4-2 record including an im-
pressive win over Lynchburg College
into this game. This game was especi-
ally important for W&L because it
assured the Generals of a place in
the state tournament.

Washington and Lee going into this
game had not been playing excellent
soccer and was in an unimpressive
slump. This game could turn the tide
in a season of sporadic play.

Excellent performances were turned
in by several members of the squad,
sophomore Kurt Jamison leading the
offense with a pair of goals. One goal
was a head in with an assist going
to Jack Horowitz, His second goal
was off a rebound,

The General’s other goal was ac-
counted for by Craig on a pass from
Tommy Fechtel, who played well

a starter,

This game ties W&L with Eastern
Mennonite in state play with a 4-3
record,

Other good performances were
turned in by Charlie Harrold and
Richard Burroughs. The latter play-
ing a great defensive game. Jack
Horowitz and Scott Fechnay also
looked impresive.

The Generals next game is Tues-
day against the University of Vir-
ginia which will be played away.

Another exibition of teamwork, de-
sire, and hustle as exhibited yesterday

Generals vs. Tigers
Dates Back 75 Years

By LEE MecLAUGHLIN
Head Football Coach

Bridgewater proved a little tougher
than we had anticipated. However,
the win was con-
vincing, if not one-
sided.

Cary Green's
three - for - three
(three field goals in
three attempts) was
the most spectacu-
lar performance of
of the day. Bucky
Cunningham's _ six
receptions were al-
so helpful in the
victory. Our pass
defense was effective, but this was
the first time this year that we did
not have an interception.

It is now “Tiger Week.” We have
been working especially hard to pre-
pare for the “Purple Tigers.” Our
Monday night one-hour meeting lasted
eighty minutes. In other words, we
are giving a little extra time and!
energy to get ready for Sewanee.

In the series that dates back to
1892, the Tigers are ahead by two
games, 9-7. They have scored 220
points, while we have tallied 213. We
hope to overcome the difference this
Saturday.

In the past ten years, the two teams
are 5-5, Only one of our victories
came on the Sewanee Mountain, We
think that we can lick the “Tiger”
in his lair Saturday, Wish us luck.

By ROY CARLTON

On Tuesday afternoon, Scott Fech-
nay and Jack Horowitz demolished
VMI’s inexeprienced soccer team. It
was not W&L’s best performance of
the season, but the play of these two
could not be ignored. Fechnay scored
all five of the General's goals in a
5-1 contest, while Horowitz was
credited with two assists.

VMI was clearly the inferior team,
Winless, their best game had been a
4-2 loss to William and Mary, a team
W&L had mauled 7-0. However, when
the Keydets marched off the field at
the half, the Big Blue found itself
deadlocked at one apiece. Making
up for their inexperience with hustl-
ing determined play, VMI matched
Fechnay’s first goal with a tally by
Meybin midway through the second
quarter. They continued to provide
serious Opposition through most of the
third period, as the Generals could
not seem to organize any real offense.

Fechnay had returned the lead to
W&L at 2:25 of the third period. Late
in the quarter, the VMI defense began
to cave in as W&L applied some pres-
sure on the Keydet goal. Lying on
the ground before the goal, Fechnay
kicked in an off-target shot by Horo-
witz to increase the lead to 3-1 at
18:40,

The Generals continued to harass
the opposition during the fourth
period as Fechnay kicked in feeds
from Horowitz and Jamison for his
4th and Sth goals. Were it not for the
fine play of Horowitz and Fechnay,

But maintaining the top spot might
take some doing, especially when the

Bryant one spot lower.

“Bryant has been running well this
fall,” says Miller, “and his familiarity
with this course might present Romano
a strong challenge for the individual
title. Bryant will have to be at his
best, though.”

Southwestern, Centre, and Sewanee
are cited by Miller as having outside
chances for the championship.

“Ashby’s absence definitely will hurt
the Lynx,” says Miller. “He finished
only seconds behind Romano last
year, and it figured to be a real tight
race this time, especially since he
won the mile run at the CAC spring
track tournament five months ago.

Centre, defeated by the Generals,
16-45, in a dual meet here earlier this
fall, has a young team, while this

Dr. William J. Watt, assistant dean
of the college, explained Thursday
that the proposals were made in order
to bring the examination schedule back
into conformity with students’ real
course schedules—schedules which
under the present exam system often
meant a student could have three or
four exams in two days.

When the examination schedule was
last revised ten years ago, according

quirements have changed.” Advanced
placement for freshmen and a relaxa-
tion of other course requirements
have meant in recent years that the
schedule is no longer as fair as it
was originally intended to be. The
“One-a-Day” Plan is an effort to
change this.

Dean Watt said a number of fac-
ulty members had approached the
committee last spring with proposals

1964, and the threat of George Wal-
lace have erased all political reasons
for an appeal to racists, say Hess
and Broder.

“What 1964 showed, of course, is
that civil rights is not just another
issue for Republicans; in the party of
Lincoln, it is the moral issue, and
even a hint of appeasement of racists
will quickly provoke a crisis of con-
science which the Republican party,
with its tradition, cannot compromise.”

Party Here to Stay

But whatever the results of 1968,
and especially in the event of a repeti-
tion of 1948, the resuscitated Re-
publican party is here to stay. Many
of its new faces, Hess and Broder
point out, among the governors and
senators wil Inot run for election in
1968.

And beyond 1968, it is the youth
of the party who will chart its direc-

Lindsay, Evans, Tower, Percy and
Baker.

well all year long.

The “blue” (offensive) line has had
a good year also. With only one
sophomore on the unit, the veteran
front line has done a fine job in com-
bating the duplicity of today’s stunt-
ing defenses. They are an experienced
crew and have improved every game.
The holes produced in the Bridgewater
game were often large enough through
which to drive the porverbial truck.

Statistics, | think, will more closely

| verify my point than that of my Tues-

day counterpart. The team cumulative
statistics (easily obtainable from Mr.
Mickey Philipps, Sports Information
Department, Washington Annex)
shows that the Generals indeed
closely approach their rivals in al-
most every offensive category. In the
passing department, the quarterback
corps of Andy Bloom, Chuck Kuhn,
and Jack Baizley has done an envi-
able job, completing for a .448 per-
centage and three touchdowns. If it's
an exciting, explosive offense the Tues-
day writers want, the passing game
seems to indicate just that.

If, however, the author of Tues-
day's column bases his claim on the
Bridgewater game (which may or may
not be the only game he has seen,
if he witnessed it at all) those figures
shoot his theory full of holes. Against
the Eagles, WAL rushed for 201 yards
and passed for 68 more, including a
touchdown. These statistics were in-
cluded on the same page as the
editorial, probably as filler material

The point of this article should be

clear. There is enough criticism of

activists and it is expected that it will
sweep the country.

The actual techniques consist of
walk-ins, talk-ins, and lounge-ins.
Demonstrators in the co-op pretended
to go about their business, talking and
drinking coffee while bewildered re-
cruiters looked on. Others protested
throughout the campus by strolling
leisurely to and from classes. Of
course all this was carried out with
a higher purpose in mind. Besides
protesting the presence of the re-
cruiters, the activists were demon-
strating one of our most sacred rights,
inherent in the very nature of the indi-
vidual—the right just not to give a
damn.

The effect of this upon the recruit-
ers was plainly visible. Marines hard-
ened by Vietnam and Berkeley melted
in the face of this passive indifference.
For the most part they were forced
to pass the time talking halfheartedly
with the few 97-pound weaklings who
straggled in with the hope of being
turned into a man while our new
breed of passive activists looked on
in glee.

Thus the concept of civil dis-
obedience has been perfected be-
yond the wildest dreams of Henry
David Thoreau and Mario Savio.
What will come next is anybody's
guess!

But while | was sitting in the co-
op one afternoon I did get a glimpse
of what may become the protest
movement of tomorrow: civil civility,
or just plain friendliness.

The protest began when a student
walked up to one of the marine re-
cruiters sitting in a corner of the
co-op with a defiant look on his face.

Student: Hi.

Marine: Hup.
Student: Nice
ing.

Marine: Are you trying to give me
a hard time?

Student: Why, of course not. Why
should 1?

Marine: Then why are you here
heckling me?

Student: Well, you looked like a
visitor to the campus, and I thought
I'd come talk to you.

Marine: Gee.

Student: Say, what's that snazzy uni-
form you're wearing?

Marine: I play in the high school
band.

Student: For « minute | thought
you might be a soldier or maybe even
a marine. | sure am glad you aren't
because they have to hurt people.

At that the marine hung his head
sadly and said, “Yes, | know.”

“Well, so long,” said the student.

“Yeah, so long,” answered the
marine as he slowly pulled out his ID
card...
