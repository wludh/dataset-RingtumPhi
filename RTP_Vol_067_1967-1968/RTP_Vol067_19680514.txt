Dance Board picks
Mitch Rider to play
for Finals concert

The activities for the Finals cock-
tail party and concert will take place
on Tuesday, June 4, the last day of
exams. Plans call for the cocktail
party to be held either behind the
Phi Kap house or in Red Square.
Both the definite location and the time

 

will be announced soon. The concert |
will begin later that evening.

The Finals committee has contract: |
ed the Robinson Brothers to play for |
the cocktail party, For the concert |
the Dance Board has arranged to have
Mitch Ryder and his Revue. If all!
goes according to plan, it is hoped |
to have the concert outdoors in the’
football field; however, if it cannot)
be held outside, it will be held in’
the gym.

The members of the Finals com- |
mittee are: Faculty Advisor, Dr. Jef-|
ferson Davis Futch, IM (Spiritual
Advisor and Apostolic Penitentiary); |
President, Rud Smith (Grand Master |
of the Imperial Silverware); Vice-
Presidents: Richard Burroughs (High
Lord Chamberlain of the Bucolic
Libations), cocktail party director; |
Wendall Winn (Grand Marshall of
the Dionysian Rites), cocktail party
director; Charlie Tomb (Minister
without Portfolio), finance director;
Bob Stack (Grand Defender of the
League of Augsburg), concert direc-
tor; Jimmy Madison (Master of the
Buck Hounds), concert director; and
Jody Kline (Grand Senechal of
Court), publicity director.

According to Smith, the grandiose
titles given to the officers were un-
covered by Dr. Futch in his untiring
research in history.

Smith also emphasized that the
committee is hampered by the fact
that most of the seniors have not
payed their six dollar dues. Enough
money is on hand to pay the band,
but “What is served and how much is
served,” he says, “depends on how
many seniors pay and when they
pay.”

A dilemma faces the Finals Week-
end Dance Committee this year. Al-
though seniors have been repeatedly
urged to pay their class dues of $6,
the majority have persisted in shirk-
ing their responsibility to those other
classes who have entertained them
this year.

Barely enough has been collected
to pay for the cocktail party combo
and this has come primarily from the
seniors in four fraternities. Unless
the remaining seniors pay their dues,
no one in the University will get a
free drink at Finals.

The class of ‘68 will try to go
out in fine style by putting on an
interesting weekend, but this can only
be done with sufficient finances, Sen-
jors are encouraged to pay their dues
to fraternity representatives or ap-

 

pointed men in the dorm so that
plans for this weekend can be finalized. |

Carter was a student at W&L in
the early °50’s, and he was instru-
mental in the founding of the Shen-
andoah. That magazine was first
created in the fall of 1950 under the
guidance of three student editors one
of whom was T. K. Wolfe, a speaker
in last year’s Contact program.

Carter became editor of the maga-

zine in 1951 when the Shenandoah
was a_ student publication § with
characteristics of both the present-

day Shenandoah and the Ariel. Among
his significant achievements as editor
included obtaining from William
Faulkner a review of Hemingway's
“The Old Man and the Sea.” He
was also able to obtain poems by
Wallace Stevens and e. e. cummings.

Carter went on to graduate study
in English and taught until his death
in 1963. His poetry has been pub-
lished previously by Louis Rubin,
who was then a professor at Hollins
and now at North Carolina.

Mrs. Carter gave most of his
correspondance to the Washington
and Lee library.

The book was published by the
Dietz Press in Richmond and the
copyright is held by Mrs, Carter.
The book contains a foreword by
Ashley Brown, a former W&L Eng-
lish professor, now at the University
of South Carolina,

The Senior class is requested to

Number 53

Troubadour Theater to present
play written by W&L graduate

“Fred,” a two-act play starring
Don Baker, Kristie Morris, and Hugh
Hill, is the last Troubadour produc-
tion of the year. Curtain time is
8:30 p.m., and the play opens Wednes-
day night and runs through Saturday.
Seats may be reserved by calling
463-2181 and asking for the Troub
extension.

The play's three rolls are held by
Don Baker as the Man, Kristie Morris
as the Girl, and Hugh Hill as Buffalo
Bill. Lee Kahn, Professor of Fine
Arts, directing this production,

Scott Miller, the playwright, was
in Lexington last Saturday and made
several revisions in the dialogue to
aid transition and in the pacing and
interpretation of the play. Miller was
graduated last year from Washington
and Lee. One of his one-act plays
was produced here last spring, and
another of his works appeared in the
“Southern Collegian.”

Miller, whose only Troub appear-
ance was in “Marat/Sade,” is cur-
rently a drama student at Yale Uni-
versity. The play is unusually brief
for a single production, the play con-
sists of one act with dialogue and
a short second act done in pantomime.

A combination of black comedy
and tragedy, Miller’s work depicts the

conflicts within an impotent man,
which lead to his eventual de-
struction,

“With this production,” Mr. Kahn

 

Congressional candidate is
YRs’ guest speaker tonight
in duPont Hall meeting

Arthur R. (Pete) Giesen, recently
announced Republican candidate for
Congress in the 7th District, will
speak here tonight.

Giesen, a Staunton businessman and
member of the Virginia House of
Delegates, will talk at 7:30 p.m. in
duPont Auditorium. He is expected
to discuss his upcoming campaign
against incumbent Democrat John O.
Marsh, Jr.

Giesen’s appearance is being spon-
sored by the W&L Young Repubdli-
cans. The public is invited.

Prior to the speech, Giesen will
meet with area Republican leaders to
discuss his November campaign for
Congress. A member of the House of
Delegates since 1964, Giesen repre-
sents Augusta and Highland Counties
and the cities of Staunton and Waynes-
boro.

Giesen has urged the active involve-
ment of college Republicans in poli-
tics. At a recent campaign workshop,
he said that a united Republican
effort would be necessary for victory
in November.

“We must tell the positive programs
which we as Republicans have to
offer to all the people of this
country,” he said. “This story must
be told forcefully, forthrightly, and
honestly.”

 

stated, “we have something entirely
new, what I like to call ‘spotlight
productions’.” By spotlight produc-
tions, he referred to new scripts and
new playwrights, with the playwright
able to see the production and de-
velopment of his work. More than
just a witness to the staging of his
play, the playwright also directs his
work.

Mr. Kahn believes, with the in-
novation of spotlight productions, all

 

areas of theatre are now offered by
the Troubadour Theatre. Don Baker's
handling of “The Country Wife” in-
troduced student direction; now play
writing is open to the student.

The current renovations to the
theatre building will not deter the
production of this play. A passage
will be cleared across the construction
and temporary doors will be installed.
Mr. Kahn expressed his one fear:
“Heaven help us if it rains.”

the Debating Club to put a plaque in

Dean Atwood noted that three
Negroes, one boy of Japanese, and
one of Chinese descent were admitted
into W&L. He said that the admini-
stration was under some pressure
from alumni and other sources to
fully assimilate these students into
the W&L community. Only one of
the Negroes will be living in the
dorms, yet Dean Atwood said that
it would probably not be good if
these boys were not bid by the fra-
ternities.

Mark Eaker, the new treasurer, re-
quested the houses fully pay the $4,-
558 that is owed the IFC and sug-
gested that dues might be lower next
year. Any house that failed to pay
before the end of the year could be
fined.

Reeve Kelsey, rush book editor,
requested each house to submit be-
fore exams a list of the fraternity

Postscript

Incredible though it seems, the Executive Committee’s en-
thusiastic willingness to make a positive, really meaningful
contribution to the Virginia Association of Student Govern-
ments appears to be dead already. About a month ago, the
president of the VASG told our EC that we should join right
away so we could attend the Association’s spring conference;
and our EC, hastily voting seven to two in favor of member-
ship two weeks ago, said it agreed with him. Well, the spring
conference came and went this past weekend, and nobody
from W&L attended—neither the outgoing nor the incoming
ECs could be bothered with sending even a single representa-
tive. That’s some way for the EC to execute the responsibilities
it was so anxious, so recently, to take on. That’s some way
for the EC to represent the student body of this University,
and to look after its interests. It seems some EC resolutions

are, like talk, cheap.
“®

Abolishing grades

Last week, Antioch joined, as W&L ought to consider joining,
the growing number of colleges which have done away with
the traditional grading system. The A-B-C-D-E-F-I scale is un-
salvageable, most good faculties seem to think these days. So
do we.

eS

Mock convention sets a standard

Steve Saunders’ and his secretariat’s superb direction of the
Mock Convention has already been applauded by everybody
who was there, from President Huntley on through the rest
of the University community. Mock Conventions in the future
will be hard pressed to do as well. Not just the mechanics but
the atmosphere too were worthy of the real thing.

But our purpose now is not to re-relate the things for
which Mr. Saunders was presented with the Gilliam and Ring-
tum Phi Awards last week. Rather, mostly for the benefit of
our readers who weren’t here for the Convention, we'd like
to make a couple of observations—not without pride—not
about the managers but about the managed: the delegates on
the floor.

First off, there seems to be at least a little truth behind the

stories of committees for certain hopefuls spending staggering |
sums trying to “buy” and “influence” delegate vores—phony |

telegrams-of-instruction, tantalizing and probably equally fake
summer-job-offers, and the like. But none of it worked, Not
at all.

And—though we don’t want to sound like a father patting
his little boy on the head—we think it’s pertinent to mention
that all the Highest Authorities on the Hill and in the Lex-
ington police station were pleasantly astonished at the decorum
(if not exactly dignity) maintained in every instance all week-
end long by the whole student body.

“
With bated breath

We await with some sense of relief but not-too-high expecta-
tions the imminent proposals of the Deferred Rush Committee
of the IFC concerning rules for 1969-70 rush, These proposals
must be submitted to the faculty no later than the first of
November next year, which means the eighteen fraternities
will have about six weeks for criticism and amendments after
school starts. Aside from the fact that the Committee is grant-
ing its constituents precious little time to consider the plans for
no less than the most massive adjustment to be required of
this University’s eighteen elite, there are a few bits of off-the-
record information we have learned, about which we are not
pleased.

As far as freshman-upperclassman contact during the first
semester is concerned, the plans as they now stand allow very
little, even on the weekends, and that which is permitted is

limited and casual. This will, we fear, create a division of classes |

severely injurious to the cohesive quality of Washington and
Lee’s student body and will effectively prohibit mature guid
ance, advice, understanding and friendship the new collegians
demand and need.

One of the more disturbing aspects of the proposals is
that in the Committee's thinking, we have heard, it was deemed
best not to make them so workable as to become palatable. In
this way the faculty would surely see the error of its ways and
allow the system to return to pledging as it now exists, We
sincerely hope we have heard wrong, but hasten to interject
our additional hopes that the proposals will be forthcoming
before this semester is finished and that the fraternity com-
munity will give itself ample time for thinking about some re
finements to make in the less than ample time it has to do so.

From our past

the lower social
unrest

If we transcend
strata in which
reached a_ fever
pitch we still find
dire problems in
interracial rela-
tionships. Take for
example Matt
Drayton, the fight-
ing liberal editor
of a large and in-
fluential San Fran-
cisco newspaper.
Having been an
outspoken advocate
of racial equality,
he finds his pholosophy severely tested
when his innocent daughter Joey falls
in love with a Negro during a nine-
day romantic whirl in Hawaii.

And not just any Negro, but a
physician—John Prentice—who was
graduated in the top of his class from
Johns Hopkins, went on to make an
outstanding record at Columbia
Medical School, and finally found
himself a high-ranking official of the
World Health Organization; at 36 he
seems to be filling the vacant shoes
of Tom Dooley and Albert Schweitz-

racial has

er. Dr. Prentice’s character and
medical achievements leave _ little
doubt that any hesitancy Drayton

might have regarding the proposed
marriage would be based primarily
on racial considerations.

Futhermore, Dr. Prentice _ insists
upon Drayton's full consent before he
will go on with the marriage; to
complicate the situation even more
the crucial endorsement is necessary
the very day Drayton discovers the
affair, for the next day Prentice and
Joey will fly to Geneva for the young
doctor's next assignment.

This sets the stage for a wrestling
match between Drayton and his con-
science—suddenly he must apply his
liberal philosophy to a rather sticky
situation. As seconds his wife, Chris-
tina, and a long-time family friend,
Monsignor Ryan, make no_ bones
about supporting his conscience while
the maid, Tillie, takes the opposing
side and swings her full weight be-
hind an original form of black power.

Through a twist of fate Mr. and

 

 

A glib review of our
new avant-garde flick

Mrs. Prentice decide to visit their
son in San Francisco before he goes
to Geneva; their initial shock at meet-
ing his fiancee equals that of the
Drayton's. Indeed when the two fath-
ers recover from their original stupe-
faction and have a conversation it
‘becomes apparent that their opinions
of the proposed marriage coincide,
almost too exactly for coincidence.
When the young Prentice has it
out with his father it becomes ap-
parent that more is at issue than mis-
cegenation; rather the question be-
comes one of the mutual obligations

of parent to child—what is owed to

parents after they have devoted years
of toil to give their children the
best opportunities. The young doctor's
response to this problem fails to
resemble a rebellious teenager and he
is quite provocative in his criticism
of his father’s attitude. He also sees
in his father a failure to meet the
responsibility of racial equality as he
is doomed to look down upon him-
self.

It is finally Drayton, however, who
attempts to draw meaningful con-
clusions from the whole affair in his
final pronouncements before dinner;
whether the issues are resolved re-
mains a moot point, and one perhaps
is left with a false sense of well-
being.

The lines may be drawn too boldly
in “Guess Who's Coming to Dinner”
—hyperbole is the reigning form and
the characters are extreme. Further-
more, as violent racial demonstrations
will probably be ubiquitous this sum-
mer, one is tempted to dismiss this
story as mere fairy tale. Nevertheless,
vital questions are examined as to
the depth of philosophical convictions
among the outspoken, the duty of
parents to their progeny and the
Negro’s prejudice against himself.

Spencer Tracy as Drayton turns in
a fine performance in his last screen
role; Sidney Poitier as the dynamic
doctor and Katherine Hepburn as
Christine Drayton are both unusually
tasteful in their portrayals. Katherine
Houghton is a bit too much as the
gushy, naive free-thinker Joey; her
inadequacies are more than over-
balanced by the pleasing jobs done by
Cecil Kellaway as the Monsignor and
Isabel Sanford as Tillie.

He said that the apartments would
burn rapidly if they were set on fire,
but so would any wooden building

Steve Saunders’ career at Wash-
ton and Lee has left in its wake a
whole host of new campus organiza
tions that mark by their diversity the
diversity of their creator, Steve's new-
est creation is the Lewis Carroli
Croquet and Cricket Society, which
is based on that immortal scene from
“Alice in Wonderland” in which the
Queen of Hearts plays croquet using
hedgehogs for balls and flamingos for
mallets.

Steve's creations aside, the winner
of the 1968 Gilliam Award has made
valuable contributions to a variety of
campus organizations, Steve directed
the very successful Mock Convention.
He is well remembered for his ex-
tensive use of the gavel at periodic
intervals and his trenchant comments
(“Will the gentleman from New York
please come to the point.”).

Steve's career in public activities
began at an early age when in 1961
he was the youngest government
official in the nation as the head
of the Nassau County Civil War
Centennial Commission,

Steve's other creations at Washing-
ton and Lee are the Freeport Tuna
Club (dedicated to the proposition
“That all men are basically fish") and
the John W. Davis Society. The form-
er is composed of the members of
Steve's dormitory section while the
latter is composed of notable campus
losers

However, Steve's success is quite
evident as his record in campus publi-
cations indicates, Steve was editor of
the Ring-tum Phi in his junior year
and directed the Southern Collegian
in his senior year. The Southern Col-
legian was almost ready to collapse
after 97 years of publication when
Saunders took over and published four
humorous issues this year that re-
flected the “Playboy” approach to
magazine design

Steve is a member of two national
honorary fraternities—Sigma Delta
Chi for Journalism and Pi Sigma
Alpha for political science. Steve was
also selected for “Who's Who in
American Colleges and Universities.”

While at Washington and Lee Steve
has received the Society of the Cin-
cinnati Award for a paper on Zach
ariah Johnston, a local Revolutionary
War patriot

 

 

 

 

Gilliam award winner
isn’t one of few interests

Next year Steve's interest in history
will be continued as he assumes a
post as master in history at the
Lawrenceville School, a private school
in New Jersey.

In high school Steve was an active
member of the Key Club and served
as Governor of New York State Key
Clubs and as Chairman of the Inter-
national Key Club Governors Con-
ference. Steve's interest in the Key
Club continues even today as he makes
frequent speaking trips to places as
far away as Alabama.

Steve also contributed much of his
time in high school to worthwhile
charities as he served in the capacity
of the New York State Youth Chair-
man for the March of Dimes and
the American Cancer Society.

Steve's one foray into athletics was
as manager for the varsity baseball
team.

Those of us who have come to
know Steve by working and being with
him over the years are of the opinion
that the student body will miss him
and will be hard-pressed to find as
capable an administrator, as warm a
personality, and as amusing a wit.

totaled 17 points for his team, Wash-
ington and Lee was led by three per-
formers who placed first in their
events. Bill Kahn, freshman from
Memphis, won the long jump at

22°%4". Mike Neer, competing with a

Medalist and low individual in the
tourney was Rusty Napier of the

rounds of 70 and 75 for a three over
par 145. Low man for Washington
and Lee was Bill McLeod, St. Peters-
burg, Fla., senior, with two rounds
of 74 for a 148 total. McLeod tied
for second place individual honors
with Waterhouse and Grubbs of
Sewanee.

Each team entered six men in the

Generals to host Wahoos tomorrow

-_ - 2 oe

Tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 p.m.
the varsity lacrosse team will close
out its season against The University
of Virginia on Wilson Field. After
losing to Duke (11-4) on Saturday the
Generals will be looking to finish the
year with a victory over the Wahoos.
This will be the last time many of
the Generals will don the familiar
biue and do battle for WAL. It will
also mark the last contest for assistant
coach Carroll Klinglehoffer who will
graduate from law school this year.

While an undergraduate here Car-
roll had a very distinguished record,
making All-American (honrable men-
tion) his senior year. He also made
the All-South team and played in the
1965 North-South All-Star Game. He
lettered four times in lacrosse and
showed the desire and determination

son lending a valuable hand in the
preparation for each match. During
games he would supervise offensive
substitutions and co-ordinate the
extra-man offense. Coach Szlasa com-
mented that Carroll gave up a tre-
mendous amount of time every day
and that without him there probably
would not have been a lacrosse team
this year.

Carroll also served another function
that probably was the most important
though completely overlooked by
everyone except Coach Szlasa: he
provided a link between the players
and the new coach. So often in a
coach’s freshman year there is a
communication problem merely be-
cause coach and players aren't used
to each other. Carroll served the pur-
pose of linking coach and player and
establishing a rapport that is so vital
to success. Carroll was close to both
coach and player. Coach Szlasa said:
“Carroll was invaluable in getting
me through my first year in coaching.”

Carroll has already passed his Vir-
ginia Bar Exam and plans to practice
law in Virginia. Coach Szlasa ex-
pressed the desire to have Carroll
do some lacrosse scouting.

Carroll will be going in the Army
in the summer but it is likely that
he will return to this area when he
finishes his duty. He is married to
the former Mary Stone Copenhaver
of Roanoke. Coach Szlasa expressed
the desire to have Carroll back in any
capacity for he posses a wonderful
talent for lacrosse playing and coach-
ing. Everyone at W&L owes Carroll
a thanks for seven years of dedica-
tion to lacrosse.

Some of the seniors on this year's
team deserve mention are Terry Grif-
fin who as captain gave a great
amount of time and desire and no
one could have asked more of a
captain; Hugh Baugher; Bob Frost;
Ralph Schenkel; Chip Chew; Tom
Pittman; Harold Stowe who is steady,

reliable and as dependable as you
could want a defenseman; Holmes
Raker; and last but not least young

Scott Farrar who is leaving Lexing-
ton to attend Episcopal School in
Alexandria (Scott was the manager)

Though the Generals are losing a
ereat bunch of players Coach Szlasa
is Optimistic about next season. Frosh
standouts Whit Morrill and Bill
Brumback will be back as will be
Joe Wich, Charlie Stewart, Jay Meri-
weather, and a host of others to
provide a very sound basis for next

U.N.C., Western Maryland, Washing-
ton College, and Fairleigh-Dickison
who is in the same league as Mary-
land, Johns Hopkins, and Navy). To-
morrow afternoon is an opportunity
to thank some of these people by
giving them some support in the sea-
son's last contest. Surely Carroll
Klinglehoffer deserves a standing ova-
tion for all his service to lacrosse and
Washington and Lee.

College Athletic Conference

(Continued from Page 3)

Coach Joe Lyles took third place in
the tourney, rebounding from a loss
Friday to take two games Saturday.
The Generals lost a squeaker Friday,
1-0, to Southwestern. Bill Rassmussen,
senior from Richmond, struck out ten
and, according to Coach Lyles, “pitch-
ed well enough to win.”

Before the game with Sewanee
Saturday morning, Coach Lyles told
his team “Sewanee is the key game;

if we can beat them, then take South-
western in a re-match.” He also called
for balance between defense and
offense, saying the team would need
“back-to-back clutch hits.”

Following this, Tom Mitchell won
his fifth game of the season, beating
Sewanee 2-1. Then Saturday after-
noon at VMI the Generals, with left-
hander John Botcheller on the mound,
edged Southwestern in a_ rematch,
4-3. The third place finish assured
Washington and Lee of the President's
Trophy.

In addition to the three consistent
pitchers, Coach Lyles singled out a
number of players as tournament
standouts. Among these were Steve
Kalista, who collected three hits and
was “outstanding” defensively. Lyles
praised catcher Jack Baizley, second-
baseman John Nolan, shortstop Gil
Fitzhugh and center-fielder Chris
Courseau for their defensive play and
Fitzhugh for his two “timely” hits
in the second Southwestern game.

Lyles’ strategy of walking poten-
tionally dangerous Sewanee and
Southwestern hitters also paid off on
four occasions,

Monday the baseball team elected
Tom Mitchell and Jim Wilson as
co-captains for next season. Mitchell
is co-captain this year.

Final IFC

meeting
(Continued from Page 1)

IFC set a basic guideline of the levels
of fines for rush week offenses. Pres-
ently many fines are levied at the
discretion of the Judicial Board which
usually attempts to base its decision
on the past precedents. Carter, IFC
president, said that the Judicial Board
would attempt to issue a set of
guidelines for rush week fines.

Huntley Johnson, chairman of the
Deferred Rush Committee and next
year’s Rush Chairman, said that there
would be a meeting of all the fra-
ternity presidents Wedensday at 6:45
in the dining hall to present the plan
| for deferred rush as well as the basic
outline of next fall's rush schedule.
It will be made public after next
| Monday,

Dean Atwood also mentioned that
the Board of Trustees is presently
| considering the proposed $600,000
| maintenance loan to about 17 of the
fraternities. He said so far seven of
the houses had indicated a favorable
response toward the loans if they
were offered by the trustees.

views on

the students; they, however, should be
much safer.

John G. Snyder, Director of Uni-
versity Services, said that the num-
ber of students desiring to live in the
apartments has increased over the
years. However, the waiting list is
usually cleared by the beginning of
the summer; some people remove
themselves from consideration by
getting other housing in town.

Snyder also said that six faculty
members and one member of the ad-
ministration live in Davidson Park,
thus taking up valuable room which
could be used by students. The faculty
moved in when the student demand
was not so great; the apartments were
also used as inducements to late-com-
ing faculty members who needed
apartments,

Edward C. Atwood, Dean of Stu-
dents, was questioned about the fi-
nancial backing for new housing. He
said that rental fees would range
between $75 and $100 per month
for new apartments; he added that
it would be physically impossible to
do it for less. He also said that the
prospect for new housing looks dim,
as he believed the students to be

Frank Parsons, Director of Uni-
versity Development, said that it was
“unlikely in the long-range plans” to
build new apartments, especially at
Hillside Terrace. The city, which
leases the land to W&L, wants to re-
place the unsightly buildings with a
park. Any expansion of university-
owned apartments would be done at
