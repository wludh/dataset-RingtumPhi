‘Hurricane’ Warnings Released

After Springs Cocktail Party

A “Hurricane” watch has been
issued in Lexington for this weekend.
But there's nothing to be worried
about. This should be the greatest
“Hurricane to hit Washington
and

ever
Lee.
The watch was announced this
afternoon by junior class president
John Carrere while he was watching
proceedings at the University Cocktail
Party at Red Square. While Bob
Marshall and the Crystals sang “She
Shot a Hole in My Soul,” Carrere
commented, “I hope the ‘Hurricanes’
don't do much damage.” Of
course, he was referring to the rum
drink served at the cocktail party
imported from Pat O'Brien's in New
Orleans.

lo make the “Hurricane” watch
more enjoyable, Carrere and his vice-
presidents (Rob Bauer, Buck Buxton,
Bill Ball, Bruce Downing, Neil Kes
sler, Pete Nowick and Jay Passavant),
have arranged to have entertainment
throughout the weekend

Beginning at 7:30 tonight Booker

General Elections On Monday;
Presidential Primary Is Close

By BOB ENTZMINGER

Herb Crenshaw and Jay Passavant
led the voting for student body presi-
dent and Don Sharpe and Alan Tomlin
made the cut-off for Fancy Dress
president in Thursday's primaries.
The general elections for student body
offices will be all day Monday. Polls
will be located in the freshman quad,
Washington Hall, the Commons and

the law school.
Candidates Speak
Candidates for the Big Three

offices—student body president, vice-
president, and secretary—spoke to
about 80 students in Evans Dining
Hall Tuesday night. Candidates for
Fancy Dress president were intro-
duced, but gave no speeches.

Presidential candidates Jeff Wexler
of Cedarhurst, N. Y., Jay Passavant,
PiKA from Beaver, Pa., and Herb
Crenshaw, SPE from Forest City,
N. C., all proposed platforms which
they said would create more student
interest and participation and to im-
prove the University, both physically
and as an academic community. (See
platforms on p. 2)

Allen Craig nominated Jeff Wexler.
Wexler presented a platform asking |
for a co-op run on a non-profit basis, |
library improvements, Executive Com- |
mittee jurisdiction over the Dance |
Board, Fancy Dress scheduling by'

 

referendum, student management of
WLUR-FM, reviewable grades and
more vending machines in the dorms,

John Carrere introduced Jay Pas-
savant. Passavant said that his many
school activities gave him the neces-
sary diversity and technical com-
petence to be president. He asked
for a general review of standards and
goals, especially in the Assimilation
Committee, and he favored not join-
ing the Virginia Association of Stu-
dent Governments (VASG) now, but
stressed that the matter is “not closed.”
He also affirmed recent administra-
tion recommendations concerning re-
pair of fraternity and the Gaines So-
ciety houses, and agreed with Presi-
dent Huntley's effort to establish
closer communication between stu-
dent groups and the president.

Clark Carter introduced Herb
Crenshaw. Crenshaw said that while
he was willing to stand on his record,
he believed that the students should
play a larger and more active role in
the University’s future. The planks of
his platform included a renewal of
open student support for the Honor
System as it stands, no Saturday
classes, exams before Christmas, join-
ing the VASG, more student-faculty
interchange both on committees and
informally, and a review of the role
of student committees.

Candidates for vice-president are
Jeb Brown, Phi Gam from Potomac,

 

gins at 8 p.m. with Anthony and the
Imperials and the Isley Brothers.
Conventional dress will be required
at both concerts.

 

Will Discuss Admiralty Law

The University Proctor suggests
that during Springs Weekend lug-
gage should not be left in cars
unless locked in the trunk, and
dormitory room doors should be
locked in the occupants’ absence.

 

Extensive decorations are also plan-
ned for the concerts and the students
have been asked not to tear them
up or take them as souvenirs since
many of them are rented. There will
be of candle lanterns on the
grass outside the gym. The columns
will be decorated with eleven pen
nanis in a butterfly arrangement
Over the door will be a sign reading
“French Quarter Vieux Carre.”

Friedman Claims Controls Hurt Public

By PAT AREY

Competition is the best way to
control the economy, Dr. Milton
Friedman told Washington and Lee
students Thursday.

Friedman, a critic of the “new
economics” and advisor to 1964 presi-
dential candidate Barry Goldwater,
spoke in Lee Chapel at the annual
Phi Beta Kappa-Cincinnatti Society
day convocation.

Ihe best control for a capitalist,
Dr. Friedman said, “is another capit-
alist on his tail.”

He said he opposed such programs
as import quotas, farm subsiding and
urban renewal, because these pro-
grams favor business interests instead

of consumers.
Urban renewal, he said, has elimi-
nated some slums, but not slum

dwellers, And it has resulted in fewer
housing units.

Throughout the economic structure
are an enormous amount of pro-
grams serving special intrests, Dr.
Friedman said. These special interests
represent the producer, rather than
the consumer, he added

The auto safety law recently pass-
ed by Congress is being taken over
by special interests, he pointed out
The law has already made it more
difficult for foreign-made to
compete in American markets,

proposed “negative income tax” would

proposal would allow people on wel

earnings, if they could get a job,
instead of forfeiting that same amount
in welfare benefits.

This program, Dr. Friedman said,
would provide an incentive for people
on welfare to get a job.

from Roswell, N. Mex.

Brown said that he felt past EC’s
had not been as progressive and as
efficient as they might have been.
He stressed the need for an active
student body to meet the challenge
of improving W&I.

Leonard sai that in his two EC
terms he had seen many proposals
fail narrowly when the proper leader-
ship could have made them successful.
He stressed that the school’s transi-
tion years had passed and that next
year is crucial in W&L’s future. He
asked for a review of student com-
mittees and encouragement of build-
ing programs. Of the Honor System
he said that its spirit must be revived.
The student body as a whole, he
said, had lost its “spirit of concern,”
and the EC must “instill a sense of
responsibility” that is now missing.

Greek Week Farce

Shall we stop kidding ouselves? Greek
Week is a farce. If by some happy stroke it
were abolished tomorrow, we’d be hard press-
ed to find anyone on this campus who could
shed an honest tear over it—and frankly, we
can’t find that attitude very blamable.

No one should try to find fault with the
IFC committee which was placed in charge
of organizing the Greek Week program. Faced
with the Greek Week concept, the committee
did everything it could have done to make it
work, and it deserves praise for that. If its
efforts did not have the success it deserved,
the blame lies with the Greek Week idea,
and not with those who had the work within
its limitations.

The truth is that there is probably no stu-
dent institution at W&L which is so little in
keeping with the temper of the students at
whom it is directed, or less arouses their in-
terest. Those who wish to do so may drag up
the old cry of “Apathy!”, but in this case, at
least, apathy is no crime.

Greek Week is the child of last year’s intense
debate over the goals and purposes of the
fraternity system here. Under pressure from
both faculty and students, the IFC began a
half-hearted study of means to redirect those
goals, partly out of a sincere interest in re-
form, partly in order to get the heat turned
off. One of the programs that floated to the
surface was Greek Week. Fifteen houses de-
cided to vote for it, two abstained, and only
one voted resolutely against it. There can
be little doubt that most of those who voted
for the program did so from mixed and not
always lofty motives. The house that voted
against it probably expressed the real opinion
of many, but did so for all the wrong reasons
(ie., that fraternities, being purely social
clubs, have no reason to justify themselves
in other activities) .

That’s how Greek Week got started—an
experiment for some, a dodge for many, a
sincere reform for a very few. As an experi-
ment it has definitely outlived its usefulness;
as a reform it has been a flat failure. If it
has succeeded as a dodge, that is only to the
fraternities’ discredit.

To put it simply, Greek Week has nothing
to say to W&L fraternity men. Of the three
main parts of the program—community serv-
ice, lectures on the role of fraternities at
W&L, and the relay games—only the latter
arouses any real interest, and that is the part
of Greek Week that lies farthest from the
program’s real aims. If there was any attend-
ance at last week’s two lectures, it was because
there was a trophy waiting for whoever could
rack up the most points, not because anyone
there thought that what was said was going

to be of any importance. And the community
service activities were undertaken for the same
reasons.

Greek Week is an empty form, complied
with by most fraternities and ignored, prob-
ably more honestly, by a few. The conditions
which give substance to the form at other
colleges do not exist here, and it is foolish
to imagine that those conditions will be created
here by observance of the form. The whole
business stands as an example of what happens
when institutions are imported whole from
other schools without shaping them to special
problems here.

If we are to have a program of some kind
which will remind fraternities of their responsi-
bility to the university and to the community,
then it will have to be a great deal different.
To start with, it will have to have the respect
among students which Greek Week will never
have. It will have to be a continuing program,
one which takes in activities consistently and
regularly during the whole year, instead of
only during a few days of one week. Its
proper functioning will have to be made
the responsibility of a permanent body—if
not the IFC Judicial Board itself, then at
least a standing committee similar to those
which operate under the EC—which will hold
regular meetings, take advantage of special
opportunities which may arise for fraternities
to make a significant contribution to the
school or the community, and act generally
as a liaison between the fraternities and those
to whom the fraternities have a responsibility.
At least minimum observance of the program
will have to be made mandatory, and the IFC,
which is so lavish with fines over something
it really cares about, like Rush Week, can
afford to levy a few fines over what it ought
to care about. And the program must come
voluntarily from the fraternities themselves;
threats will only bring on more Greek Weeks.

But no program, however well organized,
will ever be anything more than a form as
long as the fraternity men of this campus
remain divided over just what the responsi-
bilities of a fraternity toward the university
and the community are. The gap between
those who feel a fraternity is justified as a
social club and those who feel it ought to be
more is a wide one, and there are many more
people who believe in the social concept than
they themselves will admit. Somehow, this
division of opinion must be resolved; unanim-
mous purpose is the prerequisite, not the
result, of an effective program. And all this
in turn requires that the hypocrisy that pres-
ently conceals the division be cleaned away.

As a step in the right direction, how about
ending Greek Week?

It has not been my practice in the

Secretary of the
Student Body
simply to criticize,
but rather to sug-
gest: instead of just

questions, | shall
attempt answers.
rather than tear

down, | shall build
up

In this election
my primary con-
cern is the apathy
in Washington and

Simmons

Lee student government. | believe that

 

 

Probably the biggest problem at
WAL is that there is a general lack
of true “student voice.” I feel that
the student body should give a great
deal of choice to current and relative
student issues and problems.

A major problem consists of a gen-
eral lack of communication between
the members of the student body.
and the Executive Committee. 1
would try to alleviate, in part, this
problem by editing a newsletter which
would contain the minutes of the
previous E.C, meeting, and an ex-
planation of what is occurring in
committees as well, This newsletter
could include letters from members

 

of the student body as well. This

this apathy is partially due to lack of
communication between the EC, the
students, the faculty, and the Ad-
ministration. | propose that this gap
in communication could in part be
remedied by the Secretary of the
Student Body publishing the EC
minutes in the Ring-tum Phi and by

| sending a copy of them to each of

the fraternity houses, If elected, this
I promise to do. More significantly,
I think that this apathy is due to a
lack of positive leadership. Before

| WAL students can take an active in-
| terest in their government, they must

| believe

that the EC is being con-
structive—-is initiating action. The EC
must in some way inspire the student
body. As Secretary of the Student
Body, | believe that I can help pro
vide this needed leadership

The “student voice” could also be
heard by means of a student forum.
This would be an open discussion
sponsored by the EC which would
include speakers—cither noted of

otherwise, on topics which the stu-|
dent body is interested in and feels)
pertinent. | would propose such a_

measure if | am elected. This would
allow students of all classes to voice
their opinions and take an active part
in pertinent student affairs, This
would also allow for a true exchange
ot ideas—something greatly lacking
on the WAL campus at this time,

In conjunction with this “student
forum,” | would also propose a stu-

At present, there is no central
committee in charge of appraising the
progress and directing the implementa-
tion of the recommendations of the
Self-Study. As a member of the EC
I will work towards the creation of
such a committee,

Furthermore, through the Curricu-
lum Committee the EC could exert
much influence in such matters as the
institution of a flexible exam schedule
and the lengthening of semester break.
While limited progress has been made
in this direction, | think much more
can be achieved, As Secretary of the

Herb Crenshaw

By HERB CRENSHAW

This year we have already seen
important changes in this university,
both in the atti-
tude of the student
body, and in the
school’s evolution
toward modern
academic tradi-
tions. | am asking
for your  consid-
eration for the
presidency of your
student body be-
cause I believe we
can contribute to
this progress.

For instance, the Executive Com-
mittee of the student body will be in
a pivotal position next year to signifi-
cantly improve the academic climate
by continuing some of the reforms
in exams and in scheduling achieved
this year.

As the only candidate with any ex-
perience on your Executive Commit-

 

Crenshaw

tee, I feel we will be able to ac-
complish the following ideas, or at
least initiate action:

First, we need a more flexible exam
schedule by giving students a choice
of the days on which they wish to
take final exams. Second, as was
recommended in the Self-Study Re-
port, first semester exams would be
more advantageous if held ‘before, not
after Christmas vacation, Third, Sat-
urday classes should be abolished, and
we first began this drive in 1966,
when we were able to have abolished
the Saturday classes of Openings and
Springs. Fourth, we should have more
student representation on faculty
committees.

All four of these measures are di-
rectly beneficial to students them-
selves. They are consistent with the
movement which resulted in the
abolishment of mid-semester grades.
I served as chairman of the com-
mittee which studied and recommend-
ed this.

Of course we need much more
than even this. I support affiliation
with the Virginia Association of Stu-
dent Governments, enlargement of

For Student Body President . . .

the Curriculum Committee, re-organi-
zation of the Assimilation Committee
and of freshman camp, as well as
closer general E.C. supervision over
the various committee chairmen.

I think that if we are not fooling
ourselves, experience is essential to
strong leadership. The President of
the student body is responsible for
administering the honor system, not
for just sitting in and voting in a
trial. He conducts the trial. This is
why I sincerely believe E.C. ex-
perience is essential for the Student
Body President.

The vision which I have of Wash-
ington and Lee’s Executive committee
is one in which significant improve-
ments can and will be achieved in
the areas which affect the students,
hence my emphasis on exam and
schedule reform.

Each of us builds in his own way
a part of the structure of what we
want in next year’s E.C. By your
support in Monday’s balloting, we
will have laid a cornerstone of
realistic and meaningful reform.
Then, together, we can build on that
foundation.

 

Jay Passavant

By JAY PASSAVANT

Undoubtedly, one of the foremost
questions that I have encountered dur-
ing my campaign
this week is wheth-
er or not I feel
I can handle the
job of Executive
Committee Presi-
dent without hav-
ing had previous
E. C. experience.
The answer is a
very definite yes,
for the following
reasons,

Initially 1 feel
that leadership, as such, is a prime
qualification for this office. The presi-
dent of the E.C. must be capable of
commanding the respect and co-
operation, not only of other E.C,
members, but of the entire student
body. I feel that my qualifications

 

as a leader speak for themselves, and

 

much from this experience.

Secondly, the president of the E.C.
needs a knowledge of the procedural
system not only in legislative matters
but also in Honor trials. To me, there
is no question that based on my past
dealings with procedure as president
of my fraternity, in the LF.C., and
as president of the F.C.A., I could
very easily and quickly adjust to the
procedure system as established in the
B.C.

To summarize, it is my belief that
my past record as a leader and my
familiarity with technical procedures
more than confirm my ability not only
to cope with problems of the E.C.,
but to deal with them capably,
straightforwardly, and systematically.
One of the primary reasons for my
running for the office of Student
Body President is that I feel that a
new dimension so to speak can be
added to the Executive Committee.
Through active student participation
and direct consultation and confronta-
tion with interested students | would
like to see the E.C. become a more

I can assure you that | have gained) creative, a more influential, and a

 

more useful form of expression at
Washington and Lee. I have been
convinced during the course of my
campaign that many students are
themselves concerned about the gen-
eral apathy and lack of interest which
has crept over our university, and
these same students are very eager
to find a means by which this apathy
can be assuaged. In conjunction with
this, I strongly urge that the E.C.
initiate a program by which direct
consultation with President Huntley
would be possible. The president has
expressed an interest; it is now up to
us. Callousness toward Lexington
community problems is another form
of apathy and one which I feel much
can be done, as evidenced by my pro-
posal of a Big Brother system for
WA&L and town boys,

The problems are large in number
and my space is limited but simply
let me say in closing that the time
has come to Washington and Lee
for a rebirth of initiative, expression,
and participation and | would be hon-
ored to lead you, the student body,
in initiating such a change.

 

Jeb Brown

By J. E. BROWN

The time for the politics of per-
sonality has come to an end for
Washington and
Lee. No longer
can WA&L remain
oblivious to the
changes going on
around it, If W&L
is to remain a
viable educational
institution, it must
change quickly, or
time will pass us
by, if it has not al-
ready. In this com-
ing election, there
is a chance for the student body to
voice their desire for a change in the
present policy of the school, However
students became more aware of what
is happening on their own campus,

and have taught me the proper chan-
nels to move through to get things
done, My platform is tempered with
experience and realism:

1) Our Honor System which several
candidates have referred to as ap-
pearing to be working excellently
seems to me to be in serious trouble.
Students must be made more aware
of their individual responsibility for
the maintenance of a spirit of honor
or be forced to sit by and watch as
a spirit ef uneoncern destroys our

Leonard

 

present system

 

much of their voice will be dampened.
Specifically, here are some of the
problem areas students should be
familiar with and which I hope to
correct:

1) F.B.1. agents have been investi-
gating members of the Students
Against the War. Whether or not
one agrees with the aims of this
group, this a threat to free expression
of ideals for all of us. The administra-
tion policy, at present, is that no
F.B.1. agent will be given any in-
formation by the registrar, the deans,
or the faculty, unless a student ap-
plies for a federal job. All I want
the E.C. to do is to adopt a similar
resolution. Students here should at
least be concerned enough to stand up
for their own rights.

2) Students have complained of
being given a “raw deal” by some
teachers. If final exams were handed
back, they would have some proof,

3) The Student Control Commitice
passes On its peers as much as does

 

2) I call for a new approach to the
administration of student committees
such as the Library Committee and
the Assimilation Committee. Either
revamp them into worthwhile and
purposeful committees by granting
them larger roles in student govern-
ment or dissolve them.

3) This year on the Executive Com-
mittee, we managed to get some con-
cessions for more liberal exam
scheduling. Let's push for more next
year, possibly toward complete self-
scheduling.

4) We now have a University Presi-
dent in Dr. Huntley who is willing to
listen to students and who is receptive
to our ideas and opinions, | propose
the E.C. organize small monthly meet
ings between President Huntley and
student leaders to serve as an ad
ministrative forum for dealing with
student views and student problems

5) I propose a more liberal cut
system to be extended into the fresh-
man and sophomore classes,

6) Having talked with the ad-
ministration about scheduling exams
before Christmas, | learned that there
exXisis NO consensus for such a move
I don't believe this is so, I propose

 

that the E.C. adopt a resolution in
favor of rescheduling and, at the
same, get faculty members who are |
in favor of it to introduce a pro
posal for it in a faculty meeting. 1
believe we can find consensus for it

7) If a spirit of concern, a spirit
of interest, and a spirit of responsi- |

For Student Body Vice President . . .

the E.C.: therefore, it should be elect-
ed and not appointed.

4) Students should be allowed to
voice their opinions in faculty com-
mittee meetings, and the E.C. should
have a representative at monthly
faculty meetings,

5) An avenue of communication
with the Board of Trustees is needed.

6) There is an immediate need for
an equal representation for students
on the powerful Student Affairs Com-
mittee. They are presently outnumb-
ered 4 to 3.

7) The law school should adopt
the J.D. degree instead of the L.L.B.,
because it has greater prestige and
usually a higher pay scale. Further-
more, law school members should
not be required to attend university
assemblies, These people are mature
enough to make up their own minds.

There are other problems here at
WAL, but these seem to me to be
the most pressing. | would hope |
could help correct them.
bility dominated this campus rather
than one of general unconcern, |
believe we would find the faculty
much more receptive to student ideas
and opinions, Therefore, I propose
that the E.C, devote the necessary
time and energy to show students the
possible favorable alternatives if the
campus attitude were reversed through
an attempt to instill a spirit of in-
terest, a spirit of concern, and a spirit
of responsibility.

I would sincerely appreciate the op-
portunity to put this plan into action!
Thank you.

Goshen Classic Set
For Next Saturday

Can Jim Batterson regain his crown
as Tuber of the Year? Will the
Kappa Sigs field a sober entry? Will
Mickey Phillipps’ kidneys hold out?
These are some of the questions that
will be answered next Saturday after-
noon when the Friday Ring-tum Phi,
in conjunction with the W&L Repub-
lican Mock Convention, kicks off
Mock Convention Week with the
second annual running of the now
widely acclaimed Goshen Classic.

The first Goshen Classic, while
snubbed by Sports Hlustrated and the
Daily Inquirer, received such wide
regional attention that Classic officials
are predicting that this year’s event
will draw an even greater field than
the 28 intrepid souls that braved the
white waters of the Maury River last
year in the innaugural running.

Meet Director and Friday Sports
Editor Jerry Perlman is very optimistic
about this year’s running. In a Fri-
day edition exclusive interview, he
was quoted as saying, “I expect ap-
proximately 50 to 75 entrants this
year in all classes, even with the
knowledge that most of the African
nations are boycoting the event be-
cause of our refusal to bar South
Africa’s participation, My contacts

the optimum water temperature and
current speed for the event.”
Two O'clock Start

The Classic, which will begin at
2:00 p.m. Saturday, April 27 at the
upper (westernmost) picnic ground at
Goshen, will once more comprised
of three separate but simultaneously
run events. They are (1) the Down-
river Grand Slalom, for members of
the Washington and Lee student body;
(2) the Powderpuff Sweepstakes for
girls only; and (3) the President's
Trophy Race, for W&L faculty and
staff members.

Individual prizes for the winners of |

each event will be furnished by John
Norman's College Town Shop of Lex-

dinner jacket by After Six for the
Downriver Grand Slalom winner, a
twenty dollar bathing suit by Sea

champion, and a pair of Bostonian
loafers for the victor in the Presi-
dent’s Trophy Race.
Important Rule Change

In an important change from last} |

year, meet officials are excepting un-
limited entries for all three events.
However, the winner of the coveted
title “Tube Team of the Year,” will
be awarded as it has been in the
past: on a two-man team basis as
part of the Downriver Grand Slalom.
The two fastest tubers from each of
WAL’s 18 fraternities, the Francis P.
Gaines Society, and the W&L Student
Bar Association, will represent their
respective organizations, the winning
team receiving a keg of beer for his
group.

to be held tomorrow and Sunday on Wilson Field. Other teams taking part
in the event are Lynchburg College and Duke University, Villanova Uni-
versity slated to be the fourth entry, cancelled last week because of injuries
and travel complications. The Generals will meet Lynchburg at 4:30 p.m.
tomorrow on Wilson Field, and the winner meets top-seeded Duke Sunday
at 2:00 p.m., that game also to be played on the Wilson Field turf. Trophies
will be awarded to the first and second place teams, and a permanent cup, the

Neer Topples

By STUART PORTER

The Washington and Lee cinder-
' !'men overpowered a relatively small
Lynchburg College team, 91-53, for
their second consecutive win of the
season, Wednesday on Wilson Field.
Mike Neer continued his record-
| breaking high jumping ways, setting
a new school record at six feet, four-
and three-quarters inches. In an at-
tempt to greatly improve his high
jumping, Neer did not participate in
his three other usual events.

Sweep Shot

The Generals jumped out to an
early lead by sweeping all three places
in the shotput. Phil Jones placed first
with a 43’3'%” heave, followed by
Doug Deaton and Earl Edwards. W&L
retained this lead throughout the
meet, although the score was only
12-11 after the third event.

The Big Blue also swept the only
other one-sided event of the meet,
the 120-yard high hurdles, which was
won by Dave Ennis with a time of
16 seconds. He was followed closely
by Drew Thomas and Mike Stevens.
Thomas later came back to win the
440-yard intermediate hurdles with a
time of 1:02.2.

W&L had a much better showing
in the field events than in those on
the track, capturing at least a first
place in each of the former. Don
Sharpe won the javelin with a throw
of 151’, Doug Deaton took the discus

 

with a 131° 11” hurl, John Lawrence
won the pole vault, and Neer and

 

Thinclads Beat Hornets;

Own Record

Jones won their previously mention-
ed events.
More Firsts

Others capturing firsts for the home
team were Bill Kahn in the long
jump, Bob Armstrong in the 440-
dash, and Corbet Bryant in the mile
run.

Sam Hinkle, usually a big winner
for W&L, was up against some stiff
competition in the persons of Mssrs.
Driscoll and Toms, who together took
three firsts and two seconds. Hinkle
did manage, however, to take third
in the 100 and 200-yard dashes.

Second places for the Generals
were taken by Bob Stack in the mile,
Bob Bigham in the 440-yard dash,
Greg Crampton in the discus, Jay
Passavant in the javelin, Bob Jenson
in the 880-yard run, and Mike Stevens
in the 440-yard intermediate hurdles.

By ROY CARLTON

Washington and Lee's bid for
athletic immortality died in the clos-
ing second of yesterday's lacrosse
game on Wilson Field. W&L’s illustri-
ous Generals were fighting tooth and
nail with mighty Notre Dame! Nobody
could really believe a tiny institution
nestled in the Shenandoah Valley
could defeat the world’s greatest
athletic powerhouse, or could they?
For quite a while the impossible look-
ed possible.

Not that the Generals couldn't have
done it (if anything, they were favor-
ed), but there has to be an element
of brilliance in the thought of W&L

toppling the Irish. The Blue fought
hard the whole game, and for most
of the fourth quarter were locked in
a 5-5 tie. However the visitors scored
two opportunistic goals within five
minutes, seized a commanding lead,
and managed to stave off a late WAL
rally for a 7-6 win.
Beefy Irish

Bolstered by a few members of
their football squad, ND was an
extremely strong team. Their game
reflected this whenever the ball was
on the ground. Strength is not every-
thing, though, and the Generals show-
ed that by scooping up 82 ground
balls to Notre Dame's 53.

Funny thing, WAL also outshot the
Fighting Irish 40-23. In fact, cut out
the scoring plays, and the Blue were
definitely outplaying the _ visitors,
Then, what happened?

Even if the Generals were the best |
lacrosse team in the country, they
wouldn't be perfect. And that was
the problem yesterday. Notre Dame
invariably capitalized on WAL's mis-
takes with disastrous results.

The Generals got off to an early
lead on goals by Chip Chew and
Whit Morril. It looked like it was
their day. But the Irish responded
quickly, as Metzger scored two goals
within a twenty-second span. Now
the boisterous stands on Wilson be-
gan to quiet down.

Blue Claws Back

Notre Dame scored once more in
the first quarter and twice early in
the second. As the quarter neared
an end, it looked as if the Fighting
Irish might make the game a run

away. Then at 3:30 Tom Pittman
came racing across the field and
scored on a beautiful shot. Chew
added his second goal of the day

with nine seconds left, and the Gen-
erals were back to 5-4,

Washington and Lee showed iis
superiority throughout the third quart
er, but seemed unable to score, Fin
ally with 1:34 left Pittman scored
again to tie things up, That's the way
things stood of the fourth
quarter, until the roof fell in

After gaining possession behind the
goal, Charlie Stewart cleared the ball
out in front of the goal to a middie,
but an Irish attackman, Stoehr, step

most

score into the nets, With
1:42 left to play, Goalie Dave John

The question is not one of objectives
or goals, We all want W&L to provide
its students with the best possible
education. The question is rather one
of finding solutions, It is a question
of investigating new approaches and
new ideas.

I spent last year studying economics
in England; I studied and lived under
the tutorial system—an educational
system and philosophy completely dif-
ferent from our own. Through this
experience I gained insight into many
of W&L’s problems that I otherwise
would not have been able to obtain.
I think I can offer the EC some new
ideas and new approaches to old
problems.

1 only ask for your consideration;
I only promise my best effort. 1 be-
lieve that meaningful progress can be
made in all of the areas | have men-
tioned. But only with your help and
support—the help and support of all
of you—will this progress be possible.

stood, “New Jersey, Delaware, Mary-
land and Virginia were originally
selected as drawing areas for stu-
dents planning to work in Pennsyl-
vania primary, Because the vast ma-
pority of the areas designated lie east
of the Susquehanna River, most of
the college students are going to
places such as Philadelphia, Harris-
burg, and Scranton. As a result Pitts-
burgh has been shortchanged.”

Anther factor is the fact that there
are “very few students from Ohio
and West Virginia” because of the
Indiana primary campaign.

Keegin explained that the Penn-
sylvania contest, which will end with
the primary election Tuesday, is “not
a primary such as those in Indiana,
Wisconsin, and New Hampshire,
where the delegates are linked to the
primary vote.” In Pennsylvania “they
are not committed to the candidate
who wins in the primary.”

dent exchange program. This would
allow for an exchange of ideas and
systems with other colleges and uni-
versities. This could be done by send-
ing representatives to other schools—
such as Davidson, Amherst, Haver-
ford, etc., and having these schools
send representatives to W&L for a
few days. A discussion with the repre-
sentatives at the student forum would
greatly benefit W&L. This type of
exchange would allow the student
body criteria in the form of actual
comparison for more constructive
criticism of the policies of the faculty
and administration, This would have
the twofold effect of lessening the
isolation which seems to make W&L
an island away from the mainland
of colleges and universities and of
adding greater strength to the “student
voice” at W&L.

I feel that WAL’s potential is great,
and | hope that you will allow me
to work toward this greatness as stu-
dent body secretary.

(By the author of “Rally Round the Flag, Boys!”,

WAS KEATS THE BOB DYLAN
OF HIS DAY?

Who was the greatest of the English Romantic Poets—
Byron, Shelley or Keats? This question has given rise to
many lively campus discussions and not a few stabbings.
Let us today try to find an answer.

First, Keats (or The Louisville Slugger, as he is com-
monly called.) Keats’ talent bloomed early. While still a
schoolboy at St. Swithin’s he wrote his epic lines:

If lam good 1 get anapple,

So I don’t whistle in the chapel.

From this distinguished beginning he went on to write
another 40 million poems, an achievement all the more re-
markable when you consider that he was only five feet
tall! I mention this fact only to show that physical prob-
lems never keep the true artist from creating. Byron, for
example, was lame. Shelley suffered from prickly heat all
winter long. Nonetheless, these three titans of literature
never stopped writing poetry for one day.

Nor did they neglect their personal lives. Byron, a devil
with the ladies, was expelled from Oxford for dipping
Nell Gwynne’s pigtails in an inkwell. (This later became
known as Guy Fawkes Day.) He left England to fight in
the Greek war of independence. He fought bravely and
well, but women were never far from his mind, as evi-
denced by these immortal lines :

How splendid it is to fight for the Greek,

But I don’t enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to
cheek.

While Byron fought in Greece, Shelley stayed in Eng-
land, where he became razor sharpener to the Duke of
Gloucester. Shelley was happy in his work, as we know
from his classic poem, Hail to thee, blithe strop, but no
matter how he tried he was never able to get a proper edge
on the Duke’s razor, and he was soon banished to
Coventry. (This later became known as The Industrial
Revolution. )

One wonders how Shelley's life—and the course of Eng-
lish poetry—would have differed if Personna Super Stain-
less Steel Blades had been invented 200 years earlier. For
Personna is a blade that needs no stropping, honing or
whetting. It’s sharp when you get it, and sharp it stays
through shave after luxury shave. Here truly is a blade
fit for a Duke or a freshman. Moreover, this Personna,
this jewel of the blade-maker’s art, this boon to the cheek
and bounty to the dewlap, comes to you both in double-
edge style and Injector style. Get some now during “Be
Kind to Your Kisser Week.”

But I digress. Byron, I say, was in Greece and Shelley
in England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to
grow. Who does not remember his wistful lyric:

Although I am only five feet high,

Some day I will look in an elephant’s eye.

But Keats did not grow. His friends, Shelley and Byron,
touched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This
too failed. Then Byron, ever the ladies man, took up with
Lucrezia Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, and Annie Oakley.
Shelley, a more domestic type, stayed home with his wife
Mary and wrote his famous poem:

1 love to stay home with the missus and write,

And hug her and kiss her and give her a bite.

 

Mary Shelley finally got so tired of being bitten that

she went into another room and wrote Frankenstein
Upon reading the manuscript, Shelley and Byren got so
scared they immediately booked passage home to Eng-
land Keats tried to go too, but } Wis #0 am ill that the

clerk at the steamship office couldn't see him over the top
of the counter. So Keata remained in Rome and died of
shortness.

Byron and Shelley cried » lot and then together com-
posed this immortal epitaph
Good old Keata, he might have heen abort,

Truth, not poetry, is the concern of Personne, and we
tell you truly that you'll not find a better shaving com-
bination than Personna and HurmaShaee, regular or

menthol.
