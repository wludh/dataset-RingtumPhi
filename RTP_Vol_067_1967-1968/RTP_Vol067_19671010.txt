‘STAFF EDITORIALS’

It will be a policy of the Tuesday Edition this year to allot space in its
editorial columns, from time to time, to staff members who have strong and
legitimate feelings on a topic with which they have become particularly familiar
as a result of their work for the Ring-tum Phi.

Almost by definition, an ambitious staff member becomes privy to a
“garden variety” of thoughts on certain matters, and it is the feeling of the
editor that when the staff member has developed a responsible editorial on
one of these certain topics, he ought to be given the privilege of whatever
“weight” the editorial columns of this paper carry.

In all circumstances, the editor—realizing he has final responsibility for
the content of the newspaper—will pass prior judgement on the suitablity
of each draft “staff editorial”; and because they will almost always express
points of view differing somewhat from his own, these occasional “staff edi-
torials” will be distinguished by the appearance of their writers’ intials at
their conclusions.

This policy is standard on most commercial newspapers and on nearly
all college newspapers—though it has not been so on either the Tuesday
or the Friday Ring-tum Phi since 1964-1965. The difference is, we plan to
let our readership know when it is being done.

Rush Reevaluated

The faculty’s action last week to postpone its ultimatum
to the IFC concerning deferred rush is a brief, but needed,
respite.

The IFC, after much study last year of the Washington
and Lee rush system and of the rushing techniques that exist
in many other universities, decided that the basic framework
must remain intact; early rush is the best of all possible worlds
—given the world of Lexington.

Last year the faculty rejected the IFC reforms without
giving them a chance to rise or fall on their own merits. It
appeared that the faculty had somehow set its collective mind
upon a deferred rush and would not settle for anything short
of that goal. There seemed to be an atmosphere of change for
change’s sake without an analysis of all the possible results.

Apparently, the high intellectual fervor for reform was
subjugated to an unfinished student union building. By a
rather dubious exercise in logic, it would seem that all that
W&L needs to rival the New England colleges is a student
union building. The function of this magical building would
be to fill the social needs of the freshmen until such times as
they are allowed to join fraternities. The proponents of a de-
ferred rush should seriously analyze the social needs of the
freshmen and whether the student union building can fulfill
these needs.

This year should see a reevaluation of the rushing system
at Washington and Lee. The following questions should be care-
fully considered by both the IFC and the faculty: Have the
IFC pledge activities reforms improved freshman scholastic
performance? Will the student union building fulfill the social
needs of the freshmen? If there is a deferred rush, what con-
trols will be put on freshman-upperclassmen contact? Will
deferred rush result in an improvement of the intellectual cli-
mate, or in a chaotic semester-long rush?

We can only hope that both the faculty and the IFC will
maintain open minds while evaluating the pro’s and con’s of
deferred rush.

A pplication Procedures Outlined

fessor Ollinger Crenshaw of the De-

this academic year of the faculty com-
mittee on Graduate Fellowships to the
new experimental program under the
aegis of the Woodrow Wilson Na-
tional Fellowship Foundation. This
seeks “to unlock both private and
public money available for graduate
fellowships for prospective college
teachers” for 1968-1968.

Also, the Foundation again will
offer 200 dissertation fellowships to

Hugh Taylor, president of the Wood-
row Wilson National Fellowship
Foundation

 

have made outstanding academic

records and who are interested in
carrers in college teaching, should
investigate this program through

which they may be nominated by a
Washington and Lee faculty member
to become candidates as “Woodrow
Wilson Designates.” These nomina-
tions should be made directly to Dean
1. B. Cauthen, College of Arts and
Sciences, Cabell Hall, University of
Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia be-
fore October 31, 1967.

Employing the techniques of past
years and regional selection commit-
tees, the Woodrow Wilson Founda-
tion will designate 1,000 young per-
sons in the U. S. and Canada as
“best qualified as potential college
teachers,” and will identify another
1,000 winners of Honorable Mention.

Highly Competitive

A second, highly competitive cate.
gory will award 100 first year gradu-
ate fellowships to candidates from
United States colleges and universi-
ties, and 50 to Canadian institutions
This represents a drastic reduction in
the number of direct fellowship
awards of previous years,

Sir Hugh Taylor explained that the
1,000 top candidates, plus the list of
the Honorable Mention winners, will
be forwarded to deans of all graduate
schools, “many of whom have already
pledged to make offers of financial
assistance to the selected candidates.”

Despite the sharply reduced direct
Wodrow Wilson Fellowship awards,
this new and experimental program
deserves support, as helping eligible
Washington and Lee seniors to find
assistance at desirable graduate
schools, Professor Crenshaw will be
glad to explain this new Woodrow
Wilson National Fellowship Founda
tion sponsored program during the
next few weeks at his office, Wash

Clifton Forge Provides Four

Housemothers

By MICHAEL ALLDERDICE

It's not often that you get to chose
your own mother, though sometimes
it would be nice if we could. Within
the past year several fraternity houses
have had just that chance. Not only
did these ladies happen to be ex-
cellent house mothers, but it turned
out that four of them are from the
same town, Clifton Forge.

It seems that good news in Clifton
Forge travels fast, and the appeal of
the job caught on. The first two to
arrive were Mrs. M. C. Smith and
Mrs. H. R. Topping, who came to
WAL last fall. They were followed
by Mrs. M. S. Reynolds and Mrs, E.
E. Jeffries, who arrived this fall.

Into The Swing

The new Sigma Chi house mother,
Mrs. Smith, did not know anyone at
W&L when she first applied, and was
influenced by the reputation of the
school alone. More than pleased by
her surroundings here, “Mama Ru”
entered into the swing of things im-
mediately.

Like any other “freshman” she was
immediately confronted with rush
week and taken up with the hustle
and bustle of the occasion, Besides
helping decorate, she joined in on
some of the conversations during the
parties themselves. Having raised a
son and a daughter, she was pretty
well up-to-date on the discussions.

One of Mrs. Smith’s loves, being
an accomplished pianist herself, is
music. Her own grand piano is now
in the living room of the Sigma Chi
house, and she enjoys leading a song
or two during the breaks of the combo
parties. Another favorite activity is
attending our football games, which
she almost never misses. To show their
appreciation, the members of Sigma
Chi have made her an honorary sweet-
heart.

A New Challenge

Mrs. Topping had been a journalist
for 22 years before coming to the
Delta Upsilon house. Her main rea-
son for wanting to become a house-
mother was the need for a new
challenge and a change in the routine
of things.

A good friend of hers was a house-
mother at Madison, and let her in
on the ups and downs of being a
housemother. A mother of two sons,
both of whom are now married, Mrs.
Topping decided it would be better to
become a housemother at a boy's
school,

A football fan, Mrs, Topping plans)

to make most of the games this sea-
son, She is also very interested in
music. She plays the piano and organ,
sings in her church choir, and was in
the FROGS’ production of the “Mi-
kado.” Mrs. Toppings is also active
in the Business Professional Women's
Club, the Virginia Press Women, and
her garden club,

Quite A Hit
Although Mrs. Mildred Reynolds
has only been at the Sigma Nu house
since this September, she has already
made quite a hit there, She applied

For WGL

for the job soon after being informed
of the duties last spring vacation.
Once here she immediately pitched
in to help out the house during rush
week and was so taken into the spirit
of things that she put the fraternity’s
sticker on her Cadillac.

Having raised three children, she
knows how to get along with everyone
in the house. She enjoys her duties as
house mother and lets it be known
by participating in as many things as
possible. Last weekend she came to
the combo party and juked it up a
bit. In appreciation the combo dedi-
cated a song to her.

The Delts are very pleased with
their new house mother, Mrs. Jeffries.
At Clifton Forge Mrs. Jeffries was
active in church and YMCA work,

P.E. Department Needs
To Stress More Skills

By LARRY HONIG { Broup are token, consisting of exercises

which are part of no obvious organized
plan. The few minutes of hapazardly
chosen calisthenics during each period
serve only to fulfill the stubborn re-
quirement that the lower group “ex-
ercise more” than the others,

As if this in itself were not indica-
tion enough of poorly channeled
effort, students consequently spend
less time learning to play a_ sport
which they could continue outside the
class.

The freshman year, with minor ex-
ceptions, is a total waste. Few skills
are learned, fewer are mastered.

Expand Opportunities

The sophomore year is a fantastic
improvement. Participants of both
groups learn several skills. The draw-
back is that the length of time spent
learning each sport is prohibitive to
mastery.

The sophomore syllabus should be
expanded over the two years, with
each student learning a variety of
athletic skills. These skills would be
those which would make physical ed-
ucation periods something to antici-
pate, rather than eschew, such as
handball, golf, tennis, bowling, swim-
ming and gymnastics (including
weight-lifting).

The advantages to such a system
are twofold. Two months could be
alloted to each sport, in which time
the game or activity would be well
learned.

One is hard-pressed to find student
proponents of the physical education
program at Washington and Lee,
especially among freshmen and sopho-
mores whose participation is both
mandatory and unenthusiastic.

It is going to remain a fact of
undergraduate life, however, that two
years of physical training are required,
but there is no reason why the three
hours a week cannot be spent in learn-
ing skills and sports which will en-
courage lifelong athletic participation.

The sophomore program, which ap-
proaches this goal, is especially in need
of revision on one major point: the
arbitrary separation of students into
upper and lower groups, according to
performance on a four-day series of
tests.

Many Factors

There are so many factors affecting
the results of these tests that the total
score loses all meaning, except all the
extremes. A heavy beer-drinker during
Rush Week may run the mile 30
seconds under his average, which could
mean that for an entire semester he
will be in the lower group, a sort of
“remedial” physical education.

A cold in January before the tests
can have the same effect. Thus the
shape a student is in on these days
of testing plays far too decisive a role
in outlining his athletic program.

Despite the intent of those who
coach the remedial section, there is
no indication that weak students are
improved. The high score for the
triennial tests remains within a 100-
point range; the average score, which
determines the dividing line, varies
even less.

The point here is not that the
upper and lower groups are similar,
but that the determination of their
difference is but an end—not a means
toward outlining valuable physical ed-
ucation.

Attempts to improve the

Lasting Benefit

But by far the most positive benefit
is that after acquiring the acumen,
continuation would become voluntary
and enjoyable. For those whose physi-
cal prowess is not optimum, learning
to play handball and liking it is of
much greater value than a transient
course in badminton.

The test series should be retained
solely as an indicator to the coaches,
while the basis of grades would prop-
erly become participation, morale,
and ability to learn.

W&L Pulls Another Upset

Washington and Lee possibly

dent body in the nation, WAL boasts
50% of its students are involved in
at least one extreurricular political
group. (This figure is the highest this
|reporter was able to find in the

The great interest on campus in
national politics is probably one rea-

last year, among the top twenty
schools in America for producing na-

Centre FB Jerry Ingram hits impregnable blue defense.

By RIC BERARD
As I huddled amongst the brave

i band of spectators last Saturday, I

kept wondering if maybe someone
would get smart and call off the game
because of inclement weather. (I
mean, when no one stands for “Dixie,”
you know something's wrong!) But
unfortunately for Centre, no one heard
me.

You see, things didn’t go accord-
ing to plan for the visiting eleven on
Wilson Field where they bowed to
the Generals, 6-0. For the second
week in a row, Washington and Lee
outplayed, outhustled and out-lasted
the opposition to the delight of their
cold-storage audience.

Although scoring six points during
an entire afternoon is not that great,
it takes on highly respectable quali-
ties when you realize that: 1. the
touchdown was scored against last
year’s ninth-ranked small college de-
fense; 2. the Colonels of Centre had
won their first two games including,
the week before, a victory over a
CAC member, Southwestern; 3. Coach
Harmon's team had been the pre-
season picks to win the CAC champ-
ionship under the returning leadership
of last year’s all-CAC quarterback,
Joe Lamonica, and the entire starting
backfield; and, 4. the opposition scored
six fewer points than the Generals

Unlike last week, our passing game
wasn't exactly intimidating anyone
However, our running game picked-
up the slack as the Generals literally
ran Centre into the ground and the

clock out. Obviously, whatever book
Coach Harmon had on WAL failed |
to anticipate the successful offensive

emerged the victor

| aggressive play and spirit of our de

charge between the two tackles which
soon suggested that the visitors might
not recover in time to turn the tide.
And to the regret of few pneumonia
cases present, this is precisely what
happened.

Yet as the game continued, the two
teams in fact played to a standstill in
all but two departments—desire and
defensive lines. Time after time the
key defensive play belonged to W&L.
And whether it was the interception
of Lamonica’s pass in our endzone
with 2:00 left to play in the first
half, the roguish banditry of anther
pass with 0:27 left in the game, the
forcing of a Centre fumble on their
own eleven yard line, or the gusty
plunges of McDavid, W&L really
wanted “No, 2.”

While there were many outstand-
ing players for Blue last weekend, we
owe our greatest thanks to the great
defensive line play of Messrs. Mc-
Junkin, Harris and MacKenzie who
combined to make Centre’s afternoon
here along one. Because of them,
the Colonel's highly-rated “I” became
impotent as they limited the opposi-
tions running game to but one play,
the sweep right. And after exercising
that option, poor Lamonica was fore-
ed into the air. Clearly, such an
alternative was not enough

This is not to say, however, that
Centre's bubble quickly burst. W&L
did not beat a weak, punchless, or
over-confident team. Off the records,
Centre was correctly favored. And
to their credit, it took the sound of
the final gun to convince them that
they were not the better team on the
field. Rather, it is say that W&L again
out-played a favored opponent and

 

But the Generals are not without
weaknesses. They continue to be weak
in fielding punt returns, tackling any
runner past the initial defensive line
and maintaining a consistent air attack
Indeed, the offense needs to adopt the

fensive specialists if WAL is to con
tinue to improve. After all, six points
is not going to win every ball game,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Dr. Fletcher:
Old Morality

(Continued from page 1)

fined pietism as “the distortion of
piety by attempting to individualize
it;” moralism as “the corruption of
morality by attempting to trivialize
it;” and, legalism as “the distortion
of legality by attempting to absolutize
Ny

Dr. Fletcher approves of the wither-
ing away of the classical or traditional
ethics which constitute the “old
morality.” The chief fault he finds
with the “old morality” is that people
become “so concerned about what is
right that they cannot seem to see
what is good.” Dr. Fletcher’s basic
premise on this stand is that no
action is inherently wrong. He be-
lieves that the rightness or the wrong-
ness of a human action lies in its
effect on the people involved, not
in the deed itself.

His second approach to the “old
morality’ was from the prevailing
trends in theological and phiolosophi-
cal discourse. He explained that the
updating of clasical ethics by the
Vatican Council marked the end of
the counter-reformation.

His beliefs stem from the conten-
tion that only love is universally good.
Dr. Fletcher feels that it is more im-
portant to love people, than to love
law.

Political Organizations

Perhaps the greatest benefactor of
W&L’s political atmosphere is not a
club at all, but the famus quadrennial
Mock Convention. The Mock Conven-
tion does not merely occur once every
fours years, it is going on constantly.
Preparations for the 1968 event
began in the fall of 1964, when an
interim coordinator and regional man-
agers were appointed. This conven-
tion attracts many prominent political
leaders and receives nationwide cover-
age. The reason for its high regard
lies in its outstanding record, the con-
vention has been correct nine out of
thirteen times.

The Dutch Inn was hardest hit,
much the same way as the New
Dorm was robbed two years ago on
the same type weekend. Cars behind
the gym and in Lee Chapel parking
lot were reported broken into during
the game. The situation at night with
the man scattered combo parties made
the patrolling very difficult.

The police suspect the robberies
were fairly well organized by out-
siders because of the magnitude and
lack of evidence found in Lexington.

He noted that where durgs abuses,
other than alcohol, were once limited
to the lower calsses, they are now
spreading to middle and upper classes.

Dr. Williams divided the drugs he
spoke of into four groups: depres-
sants, including alcohol, barbituates,
and glue; stimulants, including caf-
feine and cocaine; hallucinogenic or
psychedelic drugs, including LSD,
mescaline, STP, bananas and liquid
