Mock Convention Secretariat
Begins Baremore Scholarship

The 1968 Mock Republican Na-
tional Convention, in addition to ful-
filling its normal tasks with the money
it raised, has decided to use what-
ever surplus funds it has to establish
the Tommy Mac Baremore Memorial
Scholarship Fund.

An estimated $200 will be con-
tributed by the Secretariat in memory
of Baremore, who served the Mock
Convention as the Director of State
Delegations until his fatal accident
at Goshen earlier this spring.

George Dover, a ZBT senior pre-
med major from Shreveport, La.,
which is also Baremore’s home town,
is handling arrangements and accept-
ing donations from other sources—
students, faculty, and other willing
contributors, State delegation chair-

men have been especially urged to
donate any surpluses left over from
the Mock Convention.

Rover said that the fund has been
established in the hope hat it will
become a_ self-perpetuating, self-en-
dowed scholarship, and stressed that
donations are tax deductible.

He emphasized that contributions
from students and student organiza-
tions are especially welcome, and that
“no contribution is too small.”

Lexington Initiates
New Fining System

A new system of punishing parking
violations—the meter kind—in Lex-
ington was recently introduced, with
a reward in the form of a reduced
fine offered as incentive to settle the
claim as soon as possible.

Most students apparently are still
unaware of the graduated fine scale,
while among the townspeople it ap-
pears to be catching on more quickly.

In lieu of the regular $2.00 fine,
the offender is charged only the
nickel that should have been in the
meter, provided he arrives at city hall
within a half hour of incurring the
ticket.

The new ordinance provides that if
the driver reaches city hall between
one half hour and one hour after
; the ticket is issued, the charge is a
dime.

The fine then jumps to one dollar
for a twenty-four hour period after
the car has been tagged, and after
that the errant parker pays the regu-
lar fine.

CIRCLE K

The Circle K is now accepting
applications for membership. Letters

“Fred,” a two act play by Scott
Miller, the Troubadour Theater's
upcoming production, scheduled to
run from May 15 through May 18,
Parts in the play are held by Don
Baker, as the Man; Kristie Morris, as
the Girl and Hugh Hill, as Buffalo
Bill. Lee Kahn, Professor of Fine
Arts and director of the Troubadour
rheater, is directing the production.

Mr. Miller graduated from Wash-
ington and Lee last year. One of his
one-act plays was produced here last
spring: another of his works appeared
in the “Southern Collegian.” Mr. Mill-
er’s only performance in a Trouba-
dour play was a role in last
“Marat-Sade.”

Kahn is expecting Miller to be in
town tomorrow to comment on the
play and make any necessary addi-
tions. Miller is currently drama
student at Yale University.

Tryouts were on April 18, and the
cast list was posted on April 21.

The Gilliam Award was established
by the Executive Committee in 1963
to honor the retiring Dean Frank J.
Gilliam, who had served the Uni-
versity as Dean of Admissions and
Dean of Students. The funds for the
award were provided for by the stu-
dent body so that the award could be
given perpetually. The EC chooses
the recipient on the basis of service
alone, with no consideration of fi-
nancial need.

The first recipient of the award
was Thomas Rains in 1963. Rains
gave the $150 prize to the English
Department for the Moffatt Seminar

WLUR-EM Is Unnoticed

The Mock Convention activities of one campus organiza-

tion went virtually unnoticed

last weekend until Chairman

Steve Saunders praised its work before he adjourned the
convention. However, by this time, there were so few delegates
left that this organization’s activities still remained a secret to

the majority of students.

This organization is WLUR-FM, Washington and Lee’s
radio station. Beginning at noon Friday with reports of the
parade before the opening session of the convention, WLUR-
FM was on the air continually until 9 p.m. Saturday, a total of
33 hours of straight broadcasting. Sunday night at 7 o’clock
the station again went on the air for four hours.

The station presented live broadcasts of every session of
the convention and added an all-night show of music “‘students
like to hear” on Friday. This marathon was handled by Dave
Katz, Jim Geason, Larry Barber and Greg Tinaglia. Katz's
show had phone calls broadcast live.

Throughout the year WLUR-FM has attempted to attract
people in the community who want to listen to culturally-
oriented programs. This should include students at Wash-
ington and Lee, but, for some reason, it doesn’t. The student
here is more interested in listening to Simon and Garfunkel
than to Beethoven. Except for rare occasions, such as the
programs last weekend and the broadcasts for the away foot-
ball and basketball games, this type of music is ignored. Since
the students finance the station, the station should cater to
their wants with at least one hour a day of rock ’n roll music.
Once a student’s attention is caught by this music, he may
keep his radio on and listen to the classical music. Under the
leadership of Charles Winston, the newly-appointed station
manager, the station is in a position to expand its hours of
programming and possibly meet the students’ wants.

WLUR-FM has great potential to build itself up. A pre-
sentation planned for next year’s Freshman Camp, as well as
letters written to incoming freshmen, should stir up interest.
However, once this interest is gotten, there must be a way to
keep it. As of now, WLUR-FM has no form of incentives to
keep interested students working on the station. Dedication to
the job is the only incentive a student has. We recommend
that credit work be given to students who are actively work-
ing on the station, or that a small salary be given to the

workers.

If the above suggestions are put into action, WLUR-FM
can win back the students as listeners and build up an interested

and experienced staff.

W&L Segregation Policy
Is a “Standing Disgrace”

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

(Editor's note: Warren Montgom-
ery graduated from WAL last June.
He was the editor for the Friday
Ring-tum Phi during his senior
year here.)

lo state that Washington and Lee
University has not led the South in

But if the University’s procrastina-
tion over integration is an embarrass
history, its continued
maintenance of a segregated social
system is a standing disgrace. It is
likely that the national organizations

WAL fraternities are not merely
private social clubs. Inasmuch as they
are a significant part of the Uni-
versily’s student social arrangement,
they are to a significant degree pub-
lic institutions. Furthermore, there is
a direct correlation between fraternity
behavior and the public image pro-
jected by Washington and Lee.

As a concerned alumnus, | urge
the University to eliminate racial
and religious discrimination in the
WAL social system by revoking the
charter of any chapter found to
discriminate on the basis of race
or religion. This suggestion is
neither novel nor radical; it was
put into effect here at Brown Uni
versity four years ago, and it is
supported by the great majority of
students. Revocation of charter
should apply not only to fraterm
ties with national discriminatory
practices but to those which prac
tice local discriminatory blackball
well. What the fraternities
choose to do with thei tradi

Talents

The duPont Galleries, scene of
many and varied art exhibitions, is
once again playing host to an ex-
hibition of student paintings and
sculptures. The annual display, the
fourth in a series under the direction
of Raymond Prohaska, Artist in Resi-
dence, has been able to include
sculpture for the first time due to
the addition this year of Sculpturor
David Hall to the Fine Arts staff.
The exhibit will continue until the
end of school year and the majority
of the works are available for pur-
chase.

Between 25 and 30 artists are
represented, usually by more than
one work. Subjects are as diversified
as the mediums involved; which in-
clude acrylics, watercolors, oils, pen
and ink sketchings, and monoprints.

AN UNTITLED painting by Ed Kintzing

Students Display Artistic
m “Art Gallery”

Approximately ten sculptors have in-
cluded their works in the exhibition.
Sculptures vary from realism to ab-
straction.

Winners of the Second annual
Washington and Lee Purchase Awards
have been announced by the judges.
Bob Ostertag, with his oil painting
“Fairview House,” received _ first
place. Second place was awarded to
Mark Faverman’s acrylic painting
“Good Boy, Bad Boy.” An acrylic
painting by Rick Cocke, entitled
“Baby Jane,” was the third place
winner, Chris Meyer's welded sculp-
ture in steel, “Untitled,” received
fourth prize. A special award, for
Kirk Stewart's “Lady Madonna” was
later disclosed.

The awards amount to a monetary
prize of approximately 75 dollars for
each winner, generously contributed
by the University, All winning works
become the property of the Fine Arts
department to be maintained and
displayed in various locations around
the school. The board of judges was
composed of Prohaska, Hall, and Dr.
Sterling Boyd, Assistant Professor
of Fine Arts.

Contributors were limited to those
students enrolled in the Studio Art
course, which is instructed by Mr.
Prohaka and Professor Hall. Each
Each student was allowed to follow
his own ideas in producing the finish-
ed products currently on display in
duPont, Time taken to complete each
piece varied from two hours to two
weeks.

Prohaska: “Pleased”

Commenting on the exhibition,
Prohaska noted: “All in all it is a
very creative and very diversified

show. Quite often students will tend
to copy the style of their instructors,
and | am pleased with the wide range
of diversity in the collection.”
Equally pleased with the exhibition,
Hall was particularly proud of the
sculpture entered by his students. He
noted that the quality of work was
superior to that he found during his
residence at Ohio State University

Political Unrest Stull
Spain’s Grim Reality

(Editor’s note: Larry Boetsch, a
junior from Glenside, Pa., is cur-
rently spending his junior year of
studies in Madrid, Spain in con-
junction with the Mary Baldwin
junior Year Abroad Program.
These are his impressions of Spain
after spending more than a year
there.)

By LARRY BOETSCH

The situation which one finds in
today’s Spain is one of interesting
contrasts. While oxcarts compete with
cars on the over-
crowded streets of
Madrid and wom-
en dressed in
black attire which
has not changed
since the 19th cen-
tury continue to
raise their eye-
brows at mini-
skirts, the visitor
finds out rapidly
that Spain is much
more than bull-
fighting and flamenco dancing. Under
the firm hand of Francisco Franco,
Spain’s 79-year old dictator, the
progress being made in Spain is ir-
refutable although the devaluation of
the peseta in November signalled
severe financial difficulties. By “pro-
gress” it is meant that the Spaniard
finds himself in a better position
than he ever dreamed of in 1939,
when Franco took the reins of power
which he has held ever since. But
Franco's critics justly claim that Spain
has progressed nowhere near its po-
tentiality and that before she can com-
pete with a surging Europe, Franco
must go.

 

Boetsch

Political unrest is most evident in
the university system as is the case
throughout the entire western world.
But the case in Spain differs in the
respect that criticism and open de-
fiance have always been met with
force. The present university crisis
has been a battle between chanting
students and club-swinging, horse-
backed police since the beginning.
There has been unrest in the uni-
versity system for several years now |
especially at the sprawling campus of |
the Madrid University, which handles |
more than 40,000 students. Com-|
plaints centered around the inadequacy |

 

 

of the state to provide for the in-
tellectual needs of state-run campuses
and the decreed illegality of student
associations outside the realm of the
mandatory, state-controlled student
syndicate. But this year, for the first
time, cries of “Down with Franco”
and “Ho-Ho-Ho Chi Minh” have been
mixed with those of “Give us Liberty.”
It appears that highly well organized,
very small group of Communist agita-
tors have taken an interest in the
problem and have stirred up a situa-
tion as bad as that of 1935 in the
university system when Communist
agitators made a great contribution
to the events leading up to the Span-
ish Civil War. Communist interest
in Spain is nothing new and when
Nikita Krushchev remarked in 1960
that the Spanish Party was the seventh
most important of all Communist
parties, everyone took a second look.
For in Spain, every critic of the
Franco government since 1939 has
been branded a Communist. The Reds
themselves are looking forward to
the death of Franco and the un-
certainty which is sure to follow as
an Opportunity to move in with their
machine and take what they can get.

Spain is desperately trying to
catch the wave of the European
surge and integrate itself more into
the Western European sphere. Saddled
with an incredibly intense national
pride, a suffering economy, and a
view more towards the glorious past
than the uncertain future, her steps
have been slow and laborious. Having
remained neutral during both world
wars, not being a NATO member,
and being geographically isolated,
Spain finds itself in the curious posi-
tion of really having neither allies
nor enemies, although the Gibraltar
question will bring the red to any
Spaniard’s cheek; and one would think
that Great Britain is the same arch-
enemy that defeated the Great
Armada in 1588. As far as the Com-
mon Market is concerned, negotia-
tions have begun, but with Spain's
uncertain future and an economy
which depends on tourism for more
than 40 per cent of its income, the Big
Six is not exactly jumping at the
chance to become seven. Also, Belg-
ium has let it be known that as long
as Franco and Francoism exist, it will

Netmen Win Two Matches,
Appear Strong for Tourney

Washington and Lee’s varsity tennis
team finished their regular season
with a flourish this week by smashing
both of their opponents, one a fellow
CAC member. Tuesday found the
Generals playing strong tennis in beat-
ing Marshall College of West Vir-
ginia. Yesterday, however, the Blue
may have raised a few conference
eyebrows, as they completely devast-
ed Centre College 9-0.

Against Marshall, W&L lost only
the number five singles and number
two doubles matches. Centre, though,
was powerless yesterday. Giving their
number one doubles team a rest, the

Certainly the Centre match has to
be considered a bright omen for this
weekend's tournament. The Colonels
are one of the teams W&L will com-
pete with, and unless the Kentuckians
were having an off day, the Generals
have some reason for optimism.

Favored in CAC

As of now, W&L has to be con-
sidered the favorite for the tourna-
ment. General netmen have been
seeded cither number one or two in
every match. However, conference
competition has always been tight, and
particularly strong opposition should

Golfers Beat Madison In Finale,
Face Tough Competition In CAC

Washington and Lee's golfers
closed their regular season play with
an easy win over Madison College
Tuesday by a 7-2 score. The Gen-
erals won all but one of the head-
to-head matchups and two of the
best ball contests at Harrisonburg’s
Spottswood Country Club.

Leading the way for W&L was
sophomore Dick Singletary who fired

a 75 to beat Madison's Joe Hoover x

6 and 5S. Bill McLeod and Gary
Silverfield both had 78's, although
McLeod lost to medalist Jim Glenn's
71. Kenny Carter, Jim Gordon and

Captain Bob Mathews also won
handily.
In best ball action, McLeod and

Carter lost to a Madison twosome
led by the hot-shooting Glenn, 5-and-
4, Singletary and Silverfield won a
close one 3-and-2, but Mathews and
Gordon had no trouble, winning by
9 holes with 7 to play. This produced
the final 7-2 score although, in an un-
official match, coaches Twombly and
Leslie ended the Madison coach's s un-

regular season

Washington and Lee University
will be host today and Saturday to
the 6th annual Spring Sports Festival
of the College Athletic Conference,
expected to involve 300 athletes from
the five member colleges and uni-
versities,

At stake will be championships in
the league’s four spring sports—base-
ball, golf, tennis, and track and field.
Also to be determined is the con-
ference champion, the school with
the best over all record in all sports—
football and basketball, plus the
spring program.

Teams are entered in each sport
from Centre College of Kentucky,
Southwestern at Memphis, the Uni-
versity of the South (Sewanee),
Washington University of St. Louis,
as well as host W&L.

Washington University’s “Battling
Bears”—the CAC’s largest member—
will bring unusally strong teams in
baseball and track to Lexington,
marking the Missouri team as prob-
able favorites to win the Presidents’
Trophy, a 300-pound locomotive bell

which signifies the league’s overall
champion.
Currently in third spot with 30

points after a second-place tie in foot-
ball and a third-place finish in basket-
blal, Washington seems to have the
power and depth needed in baseball
and track to win those sports with

4| little trouble.

Washington and Lee is the current
CAC leader with 40 points, by virtue
of a first in basketball and a second-
place tie in football. Sewanee is
second with 35 points, Southwestern
fourth with 25, and Centre last with
20 points,

Under conference rules, a winner

of a sport is awarded 25 points, the
runner-up 20, etc.

Southwestern, which last spring
broke a four-year hold by Washing-
ton on the Presidents’ Trophy, pos-
sibly could repeat as overall champion
this time if the Lynx can get strong
showings from their golf and track
teams.

It all depends, too, if some team
can knock the Bears out of the base-
ball picture. Already, Washington has
posted a 11-7-1 record on the dia-
mond, so that’s going to be a mighty
tough order to carry out.

Washington and Lee, the defending
champion in tennis, should repeat on
the basis of a strong team led by
juniors Tommy Rueger and Ray
Turman .The pair guided the Generals
into all nine finals during last year’s
Festival in Memphis, the first time
that has happened in CAC history.

An unusual feature of the Festival
will be a strong emphasis on good-
will and friendly association among
the participating athletes and their
schools.

Varsity athletes in all W&L sports,
in a program directed by head foot-
ball coach Lee McLaughlin, will act
as undergraduate hosts to the visit-
ing teams. Washington and Lee coach-
es point out that the emphasis on
goodwill and sportsmanship is con-
sistent with the basic philosophy
of the conference, which states that
players shall participate “soley be-
cause of .interest in and enjoyment
of the game” and not for any kind
of financial or other inducement.

Tournament director E. P. “Cy”
Twombly of W&L has been hard
put to squeeze four tourneys into
two days using the Generals’ norm-

have nothing to do with Spain. Thus,
a European “integration” beginning
with the Common market does not
seem likely.

The Spanish national pride is a
singular phenomenon. Although Spain
does not have much to blow its horn
about now compared with the Golden
Age, any international success, be it
a soccer match or the Eurovision
singing contest (a Spanish senorita
won it with a tune called “La, la, la”),
is met with wild enthusiasm. Foreign
nations are criticized unmercifully
probably because internal criticism has
been prohibited for so long. Spain’s
glorious history is treated with the
utmost of reverence and the cultural
tradition carried out by such figures
as Velasquez, Goya, Unamuno and
Ortega y Gassett is certainly en-
viable. Because of the blurry future,
Spain tends to look back and make
sacred its star-studded past, an atti-
tude which results in an extremely
reactionary sentiment among __ its
people.

Catholicism, the state religion as
decreed by law, also takes on an
aura of traditionalism. The radical
changes of the Ecumenical Council
of John XXIII have produced jolt
after jolt in the Spanish psyche.
Coupled with changes taking place in
the social mores of the younger gen-
eration which finds itself exposed to
the delights of T.V. and movies
produced in such extravagant places
like the United States, the social pat-
tern finds itself in profound conflict.

Spain’s Political Future Doubtful

rhe huge generation gap produced by
the tremendous losses of the Civil
War leaves Spain with hardly any
middle-age group. The effect of this
gap in today’s explosive world is
evident.

The complexities beneath the ex-
ternal calm of the land of the siesta
and olive groves make Spain a fasci-
nating adventure. There is not a more
gracious or generous people on this
earth. It is rare to find a country
where 19th century charm mixes free-
ly with 20th century turmoil. But
“La Mancha” of Don Quixote and
the Castilla of Azorin and Unamuno
make up art of just such a country,
There are few who spend time here
who find it easy to leave. And when
they do, there remains a longing to
return inexplicable to those who do
not know what they have missed.
