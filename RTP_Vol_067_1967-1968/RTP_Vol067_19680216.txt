Further Grants
Awarded To 12

Twelve additional Robert E. Lee
Research Grants for Washington and
Lee students were announced Thurs-
day by Dr. William W. Pusey III,
Dean of the College.

The grants are in addition to those
announced last fall for 50 students.
All are under the University’s unique
Robert E. Lee Research Program for
undergraduates.

Under the program, students carry
out original research in a variety of
academic fields, ranging from scientific
experiments to historical research to
compilation of bibliographies.

The students work closely with pro-
fessors in their projects, and in some
cases assist the professor in his origi-
nal research. The work is financed
through a gift made by the late Dr.
Gustavus Benz Capito of Charleston,
W. Va. in 1960.

The students, and their projects,
include:

Shephen F, Fulghum Jr., Lakeland,
Fla. junior, “Brillouin Scattering.”

Anthony M. Coyne, Decatur, Ga.
sophomore, “Solar Magnetic Storms.”

John T. Whetstone II, Birming-
ham, Ala. junior, “Surface Palsmon
Oscillations.”

A student ,to be named later, to
work with law Prof. Robert H. Gray,
“Miscellaneous Legal Studies.”

Michael W. Pustay, Bergenfield,
N. J. junior, “Economic Integration:
A Functional Approach to Unifica-
tion of Formerly Sovereign Terri-
tories.”

William A. Timmerman, Ridgeway,
N. J. junior, “Research on manu-
cript, D’Alembert and the Encyclo-

pedie.”

Fine Arts Instructor Boyd
Named Department Head
At Wake Forest University

Dr. Sterling M. Boyd will leave
his post as instructor in the fine
arts department here in June to ac-
cept the chairmanship of the same
department at Wake Forest Univer-
sity in Winston-Salem, North Caro-
lina,

He is the first acquisition of that
school in the development of their
fine arts department. Although he
will be the only fine arts professor
there next year, Dr. Boyd says that
the number of professors will hope-

| fully expand to seven over a period

of years. According to Boyd, the
staff will eventually include four in-
structors in art history and three in
studio art.

Dr. Boyd came to W&L four years
ago after earning a Ph.D. in Amer-
ican architecture from Princeton
University. He completed his under-
graduate studies at the University
of the South at Sewanee, getting a
B.S. in political science. Turning
to architecture, he then received M.A.
and M.S. degrees from Oberlin Col-
lege in Ohio.

Symposium Week--Il

Elsewhere on this page appears a letter drawing attention,
as we did in an editorial last week, to the over-emphasis in
intellectual activities at W&L—at last on the formal, public
level—on political and sociological topics of discussion. The
letter suggests, as we did, that excursions into the arts and
sciences are not “irrelevant” to the intellectual experience of
a liberal arts college (or, we would add, to that of any other
educational institution). We would like to hope, how-
ever, that the future of symposiums here is not so grim as
the letter suggests.

Last week we praised the Glasgow Endowment Committee
for what we termed its courage and good sense in undertaking
to sponsor a major symposium in the full realization that it
would not draw major crowds. We did make one error: con-
trary even to our own expectations, attendance at the lectures
on Shakespeare has been very high— indicating, we hope, that
CONTACT need not fear a lack of student interest if it

chooses to do the same sort of thing.

The Shakespeare symposium has demonstrated that Iago
can justly vie with Goldwater. We particularly remember one
scene from this weekend, as an illustration that questions of
controversy and concern do not have to be political and
social: the speaker who rushed up to the podium after hearing
another speaker's talk, declaring with anguish, ‘But what
have you done with the play?” He meant it, too.

To repeat what we said last week (but it bears repetition) :
this year’s Glasgow program has shown us that discussions of
literature in public symposiums here is not only possible but
successful. Presumably, similar topics in the arts and sciences
would have similar success—something we hope the planners

of next year’s CONTACT will take into consideration.

Bonnie And Clyde: ‘Brilliant’

By STEPHEN JOHNSON

Bonnie And Clyde, a_ brilliant,
frightening movie, is easily the best
film of the past year. It was made
by artists who un-
derstood their ma-
terial perfectly and
it is because of
this understanding,
and because of the
prevalence, among

the meaning which those activities
have. Death and pain, theirs or any-
one else’s, are unimaginable to them
and it is only in the last third of the
movie that they have their fingers
pressed upon the painful braille of
the realization of what a bullet in the
flesh feels like. Toward the very end
Bonnie presents a vision of the in-
evitable outcome of their activities

Chairman Stafford W. Keegin, in

“It has been suggested that
CONTACT’s invitation to other

terests of the student body. It was
my feeling that it would be to
the advantage of CONTACT and
Washington and Lee to extend such
invitations. The invitations were
extended after CONTACT receiv-
ed a number of inquiries from
various schools. To my knowledge
we had on campus at various times
during the symposium delegations
from American University, Catholic
University, Hampton Institute,
Madison College, Mary Baldwin,
Sweet Briar College and the Uni-
versity of Virginia. There may have
been more. It was the large dele-
gation from Sweet Briar that caused
the consternation, and I have writ-
ten today to ask that our invita-

Generals Romp 81-50 i
For Sixteenth Victory 4;

By THUNDER THORNTON

Washington and Lee’s Generals
returned to the friendly confines of
Doremus Gymnasium to begin re-
building a winning streak, defeating
Lynchburg 81-50 Tuesday night. De-
spite the final point spread, the win-
ners couldn’t count on the victory
until a second half surge put them
comfortably in command.

The Hornets grabbed the first led
and kept within from two to four
points throughout most of the early
stages. Using a tight zone and con-
trolling the tempo, the visitors got
good outside shooting from the guards
Mason and McKinney, while the Gen-
erals managed to keep slightly in
front due to balanced scoring and the
floor play of co-captain Jody Kline.

Eight Deadlocks

The score was tied eight time dur-
ing the first half, and the Generals
didn’t achieve their six-point halftime
lead of 35-29 until the final seconds,
when Mel Cartwright netted a three-
point play. The six-point spread was
the largest for either team during the

set that situation right in the final
period, The Hornets tried to keep the
pace slow, but again it was Kline
who fired his mates, with three straight
baskets, one a tip-in, one a long
jumper, and one a full court dash
for a layup following a steal.

The Generals were off and running
after this one-man display, and soon
the wrecking crew was reorganized,
using the sticky defense and high gear
offense that apparently only the exam
break had slowed down, After John
Carrere duplicated Kline’s theft-and-
basket feat to stretch the lead to 43-
29, Mal Wesselink hit an inside shot
to make it 45-29. Lynchburg got on
the board finally with a free toss
at the 17:19 mark, but couldn’t man-
age a basket until nearly six second
half minutes had elasped.

In the meantime, the Generals had
gained firm control of both boards
over the shorter Hornets, and the
presence of Cartwright, Wesselink,
and Mike Neer took its toll. At the
thirteen-minute mark, Lynchburg
tried to start a comeback of its own

| straight W&L turnovers, but, although

the play became rather ragged, the

Grapplers Close Out Home Card
With Pair Of Weekend Matches

In back-to-back matches tonight
and Saturday night, Washington and
Lee's varsity grapplers will seek to
improve their 3-5 record. Both
matches are slated for Doremus Gym-
nasium.

Plagued with injuries and academic
difficulties all year long, what
promised to be a fine team has never

| been able to get off the ground.

In tonight’s match, the Generals
i face a difficult opponent in Loyola
of Baltimore. Last year, W&L de-

feated Loyola by a close 20-18 score,
and another tight contest can be ex-
pected this year. Five of last year’s
starters for Loyola will return to
Doremus, so they will be no push-
overs.

Saturday night, Old Dominion,
pernaps the finest wrestling team in
the state, will be entertained by the

 

Big Blue. This promises to be one of

which has included West Virginia and |
North Carolina State. OD has four|
state champions in its lineup and
should provide some excellent wrestl- |
ing. As this will be the last home
match of the season, it should be
well worth attending.

The Generals’ probable lineup this
weekend will be:

Generals Romp

(Continued from page 3)

Generals maintained their scoring
pace.

Coach Canfield began substituting
at this juncture and the reserves Bill
Rhyne, Earl Edwards, Stu Fauber,
Norwood Morrison, and Charlie Stone
contributed to the final margin. A
drive by Morrison gave the victors
their largest lead at 81-43. The final

surge by the Hornets served only to

make the score look a little more
respectable.
Mel Cartwright was high scorer

for W&L with 21 tallies, followed by
Neer with 18, and Kline with 12.
The rest of the scoring was closely
balanced, as all but one of the Gen-
erals made the scoring column, Lynch-
burg could only manage double figure
efforts from its backcourt tandem,
with Mason scoring 12 and McKinney
14.

Telling figures were the shooting
and rebounding statistics. The Gen-
erals had a good night from the floor,
firing in 34 of 74 for 46 percent.
They also scored 13 of 19 from the
free throw line. Lynchburg, how-
ever, had trouble penetrating the de-
fense of the Big Blue, and saw only
20 of 64 of their long shots go in.
This 31 per cent performance was
not nearly enough, especially since the
vistors were beaten on the boards 58-
38 by the big general front line of
Cartwright, Wesselink, Neer, Ed-
wards, et al.

The victory made W&L’s mark 16-3
and kept their home floor record
perfect for this season. February 20th
will be the final home game date
against Emory and Henry, and Coach
Canfield and his boys would like to
keep good old Doremus unblemished.
Certainly, Lynchburg was left “Profit-
less” after their Doremus encounter,
if you know what I mean.

Rockbridge Concert Series
Presents String Quartet

The third event in this season's
Rockbridge Concert-Theater Series
will take place on Thursday, Febru-
ary 22, 1968. The Lywen String
Quartet will be heard that night at
8:15 p.m. in Jackson Memorial Hall
at the Virginia Military Institute.

The quartet is composed of first
chair players from the Washington
National Symphony which performed
here earlier on the same series.
Werner Lywen, from whom the group
gets its name, is the first violinist.

Other performers are Virginia
Harpham (second violin), Richard
Parnas (viola), and Dorothy Stahl
(cello),

The final event of the season, a
concert by Teresa Stich-Randall,
originally scheduled for April 8, has
been rescheduled for March 15, to
permit Miss Stich-Randal to fulfill
an important European engagement.

shots at his foreclosed farm. Even

more because those activities force
her to lead a way of life that is un-

all are forced to experience.

Vision of Human Neglect

The distance I spoke of in the
first paragraph gives a_ peculiar
effectivenss to this vision of human
neglect and responsibility. The con-
text of the film, the good, happy
world which suddenly becomes dang-
erous and frightening, works first to
trap the audience in this conception
of the world as a place inhabited
by cheerful, comfortable people to
whom we are eager and glad to
respond, The movie, in other words,
gives the audience just enough rope
with which to hang themselves. The
last third of the film stands this
happy world on its head and forces
the audience to participate in the
lesson Bonnie and Clyde are learning.
An example of what I mean is the
way in which music is used. The
Flatt and Scruggs tunes at the begin-
ning seem an amenable background
to the comic world on the screen.
When these tunes return again at
the end of the film their former use
is inverted, they are ironic reminders
of what has happened to us, the
audience, in the course of the film.

Bailey Talks On Work Laws

(Continued from page 1)

The National Right to Work Com-
mittee is a coalition of employers and
employees organized in 1955 with a
single purpose: protecting the right
of individual workers to join or not
to join without losing their jobs. The
organization faced its sternest test in
1965 when the advocates of com-
pulsory unionism pressed hard for
the repeal of Section 14(b) of the
Taft-Hartley Act which would legalize
compulsory unionism in all 50 states.
The Committee spearheaded efforts
to save 14(b) and its activities have
been recognized as a major factor
in the success of the battle.

 

Fraternities Plan Initiations

Arvin, Dan Cogan, Alan GaNun,
Charles Ross, John Stafford, Shelby

are planning a banquet and cocktail
party for them this Saturday. On
this list are Jim Allen, Steve Kerkam,
John King, John Klinedinst, Tucker
Lampkin, Kevin O'Grady, John Rode-
meir, Steve Rosenthal, Hartley Roush,
Frank Stearns, Allen Shepard, Andy
White, Roger Young, and Jack Bowie.

Phi Kappa Sigma is planning a ban-
quet for their 13 initiates on March
2 at the Robert E. Lee Hotel. These
include Tim Wright, Steve Gates,
Richard Kimball, Pat Sullivan, George
Stowe, Lawrence Miller, Carl Hyatt,
Danny Webster, Greg Raetz, Chris
Dove, Bill Gatlin, Neil Robinson, and
Steve Denton.

The 11 pledges to be initiated into
Pi Kappa Alpha in connection with
a Sunday banquet include Charles
Andrews, John Ellis, Arthur Cleve-
land, Tom Dashiell, Tom Daniel,
Claude Walker, Bill Kahn, Joe Phil-
lips, George Widener, Joel Fulmer,

Virginia in what promises to be one
of the best meets of the year. W&L
has been able to defate West Vir-

year that West Virginia has been able
to use freshmen on their team; this
is expected to be a very close meet.

he hopes will carry them to victory in

various reasons, discontinued sub-
sidized athletics and had decided to
pursue athletic policies more in line
with their enrollments, It has been
an understanding and the prevailing
feeling since then that the basic aims
of the conference have consistently
guided the member schools’ athletic
policies. It is this assumption that, I
feel in light of events of the past few
years, can no longer be taken for
granted, and subsequently, the very
reason for the CAC’s existence can
no longer be defended.

Putting ambiguities aside, this argu-
ment boils down to several specific
sets of circumstances involving the
different member schools and their
policies, First, Washington University
is in a mess and does not know what
it's going to do about it. The school
has no money for a basketball pro-
gram, wants to make money off its
football program, does not have a
football coach for next season, and
in several sports, especially baseball,
it wants to keep a “big-time” image
inconsistent with its CAC member-
ship. All in all, the school's future
as a CAC member is doubtful,

Question

automatic bids to the post-season
NCAA _ small-college tournaments,
and no sixth school is presently in
sight. Because of this rule, the Gen-
erals must compete for “at large”
berths in these events, in which they
run up aginst the Kentucky Wesleyans,
etc. of the small-college world.

Finally, and most seriously, is the
rumor currently circulating around
the conference—and given to this
columnist by a very reliable source—
that all is not over and above board
with the member schools as far as
subsidization is concerned. If athletic
scholarships or their equivalents are
being given, then the CAC is being
destroyed by its own members, and
Washington and Lee is under no
moral obligation to continue its mem-
bership.

In light of all these circumstances,
I feel that it is imperative that the
school presidents and athletic direc-
tors of the member schools meet im-
mediately and lay all their cards on
the table. If, after this occurs, the
powers-that-be at this University de-
cide that the conference no longer is
living up to the ideals or intentions
for which it was founded, plans
should be made for WAL to with-
draw from the conference and seek
its athletic fortune elsewhere.

Thirdly, the CAC has been and
always will be a geographical im-
possibility, Over a thousand miles
separate its castern-most and western-
most members, With the existing
athletic budgets at most of the schools,
regularly scheduled conference games
in sports except football are, to say
the least, improbabilities. The co-

 

hesiveness of traitional rivalries can-
not be obtained on a even basis
throughout the conference, and one-
shot, post-season meetings can never
take the place or excite the interest
of desirable but impossible regular
season play

be concerned with alternatives for |
WAL to CAC membership.) |

MORNINGS AT SEVEN...AND
THERE’S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
ABOUT IT

Any man who says morning is the best time of day is
either a liar or a meadow lark.

There is only one way to make morning enjoyable:
sleep till noon. Failing that, the very best you can do is to
make morning tolerable. This, I am pleased to report, is
possible if you will follow three simple rules:

1. Shave properly.

By shaving properly I mean shaving quietly. Don’t use
a blade that whines and complains. Morning being a time
of clanger and anger, use a blade that neither clangs nor
angs. Use a blade that makes no din on your chin, no
squeak on your cheek, no howl on your jowl, no rip on
your lip, no waves while it shaves. Use, in short, Personna

Super Stainless Steel Blades.

I have been shaving for 71 years (not too impressive
until one considers that I am 49 years old) and I am here
to tell you that the quietest blade I know is Personna. I not
only shave with Personna, but I also admire it. Old vir-
tues reappear in Personna; old values are reborn. Per-
sonna is a modest blade, an undemanding blade. Personna
does not rasp and tug, yelling, “Hey, lookit me!” No, sir,
not Personna! Silently, respectfully, unobtrusively, Per-
sonna whisks your whiskers with nary a whisper. It
shucks your soil and stubble without toil and trouble.
Why, you hardly know it’s there, this well-bred Personna
blade, this paragon of punctilio.

Moreover, this crown of the blade-maker’s art, this

epitome of epidermal efficacy,
edge style and Injector style.

is available both in Double-
Do your kisser a favor: get

I assert that a Personna shave is the best of all possible
shaves. But I do not assert that a Personna shave, brac-
ing though it may be, is enough to prepare you for the
hideous forenoon ahead. After shaving you must eat an

ample breakfast.

ake, for example, the case of Basil Metabolism, a soph-
omore at V.M.I. Basil, knowing there was to be an inspec-
tion by the Commandant one morning, prepared by stor-
ing up energy. He recognized that coffee and juice would
not sustain him, so he had a flitch of bacon, a clutch of
eggs, a batch of bagels, a notch of ham, a bunch of butter,
a swatch of grits, a hutch of honey, a patch of jelly, a
thatch of jam, a twitch of pepper, and a pinch of salt.

 

The idea was right; the quantities, alas, were not. When
the Commandant arrived, Basil, alas, was so — that

he could not raise his bloated arm in a proper sa
