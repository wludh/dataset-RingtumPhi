‘Shenandoah’ Fund Established |

In Memory Of Former Editor

A special fund to assist Washington
and Lee University’s literary maga-
zine, “Shenandoah,” has been estab-
lished with initial gifts of $4,500.

The fund was established through
a gift of $1,500 from Mrs, Myrtle
Watts Thomas of Birmingham, Ala.,
which was matched by the Coordinat-
ing Council of Literary Magazines of
Washington, D.C. The CCLM also
contributed another $1,500 outright.

Mrs. Thomas established — the
“Shenandoah Fund” in memory of
her late husband, Edward M. Hood,
Sr., a Washington and Lee alumnus.
Her son, Edward M. Hood, Jr., was
editor and a frequent contributor to
“Shenandoah” while an undergraduate
at Washington and Lee.

The fund will be used for editorial
assistance in putting out the quarterly
publication, to pay contributors to
the magazine and to finance a special
issue, said James Boatwright, associate
professor of English and “Shenan-
doah” editor.

‘Achievements’ Of The EC

Since this is the last Friday Ring-tum Phi of the current
school year, we feel as if we should review the record which
this year’s Executive Committee has “achieved.”

1. The EC named Lane Steinger to the chairmanship of
the Curriculum Committee in October. More than five months
later, the EC decided to replace Steinger, without his knowl-
edge, because of his failure to produce a report on the com-
mittee’s activities after a number of requests.

2. The EC voted to give the Student Bar Association $400
for the first semester to pay for law school subscriptions to the
Law Review. When the EC was asked to do this for the second
semester, it postponed action to see if it would be possible to
increase the student tax. Final action was taken by reallocating
30 cents per student of the student body head tax to the Law
Review.

3. The EC raised the fines for cold checks, but put off

a proposal made by Emory Waters which would strengthen | : \
| “Fred” as the last Troub play for

the Cold Check Committee. This proposal stated that the com-
mittee would pay immediately the merchant to cover any stu-
dent’s cold check, and then have the committee collect the
amount of the check plus the fine from the offender. The EC
postponed action on this recommendation but approved it
shortly afterward.

4. The EC gave the Library Committee permission to
spend the $280 of the Chitwood Memorial Fund on “best
sellers’ at its own discretion.

5. The EC defeated a motion that there be greater fresh-
man representation on the Library Committee and the Cold
Check Committee.

6. The EC discussed splitting itself into separate legislative
and judicial bodies. The arguments in favor of this were that
the splitting of roles would separate the powers and possibly
make the enforcement of the Honor System more effective.
It would also make the Honor System more independent of
politics and more respected by the students as a consequence.
The arguments against the measure were that no significant
need had been demonstrated (even though the EC was study-
ing the matter because of the difficulty it faced in allocating
its time when honor trials precluded legislative activity) and
that a split would tend to minimize the importance of both
sections.

7. The EC voted to schedule mid-terms tests in a manner
similar to final exams. But the faculty beat it to the punch
by abolishing mid-term grades for all students except freshmen.

8. The EC gave its support to the collection of freshman
dues for Fancy Dress Weekend.

9. The EC rejected membership in the Virginia Associa-
tion of Student Governments and then voted to join in time
to attend the state meeting to participate in the group’s elect-
ions. However, at VASG’s meeting last weekend, W&L was not
represented because the new president of the student body,
Jay Passavant, was not informed about it by former president
Richard Nash until two days before. By this time it was too
late to send any representative.

10. The EC voted to issue a statement of the Honor Sys-
tem to incoming freshmen around the first of May. The pur-
pose of this would be to make the freshmen aware of the
system long before freshman camp. This has not yet been
done, although the new EC is in the process of finishing it.

The record for the EC this year has not been impressive,
to say the least. This is not to say it has not done anything
constructive, but we feel that more should have been done by
a group which meets every week. Ever since the EC began last
spring with a proposal which would make living in the proposed
upperclass dormitories voluntary, it has been going downhill.

The EC got bogged down in investigations and had to
postpone many important things, which are still “being looked
into.” Committees which could have been strengthened by cer-
all the
dy namic changes in the university this year have come trom
the faculty. This is not the way it should be.

If the student body and its voice, the EC, want more
responsibility in the affairs of the university, then the EC should

Miller Reveals Orig

By LAWRENCE MeCONNELL

Fonight and Saturday night at 8:30,
the curtain will go up on the re-
maining two performances of “Fred,”
the Troubadour Theater's last pro-
duction. The players, Don Baker as
Bob Hunter, Kristie Morris as Cheryl,
and Hugh Hill as Buffalo Bill, have
rehearsed for the Troubs’ last produc-
tion of the year since the beginning
of May.

This two-act play is singular be-
cause it is the first full-length pro-
duction to be performed here that
was written by a former W&L stu-
dent. The young playwright is Scott
Miller, who graduated from W&L
last year. Miller was a student in
Mr. Lee Kahn’s acting class last year
when he first became interested in
drama. Since then he has turned out
three short plays in less than a year’s
time, a surprising number for some-
one who had taken an acting course
out of curiosity.

Miller had been in collaboration
with Kahn since October over his
last script, “Fred.” After a discussion
in January, Kahn decided to produce

understanding of his subject in this
album. He is now a more mature
lyricist than the one who merely
adapted youthful feeling to paper
and song as in “He was my Broth-
er,” a song about freedom riders
written in 1963. His experience has
gone beyond a Columbia under-
graduate. From this type of song
he has developed as a discerning
critic and commentator of the
American scene, Not all of the
songs on this new album hit with
the same power. Some are raw
and straight; others are wistful and
dreamy. But they all present a pic-
ture of America. There is a lot to
be found here to answer questions
that are raised today about what
has become of the great American
way. If “The Graduate” was about
a lack or inability to communicate,
this is an attempt to bridge that
gap.

Barbecue Will Feature New C. A. C. Bell

By CHARLIE FRERET

On Wednesday, May 22, Washing-
ton and Lee athletes, managers and
coaches will gather at Camp Maxwel-
ton for the annual Spring Sports
Barbecue. As usual monogram sweat-
ers, certificates and awards will be
presented. However, one new feature
this year will be the Bell. This, of
course, is the C.A.C. bell, won by
General teams as they emerged as
overall conference champions, This
capped a truly successful year for the
Washington and Lee sports program.

Washington and Lee participated in
twelve intercollegiate sports and play-
ed a total of 130 athletic contests.
The overall record of 72 victories,
57 losses, and one tie gave the Gen-
erals a winning percentage of .554.,
Of the 12 teams, six had winning
records and all displayed the team
spirit that made the respective coaches
proud to be associated with their
boys. While the leadership and abili-
ties of the seniors will be missed, the
nucleus of all the teams was largely
juniors and sophomores, which should
indicate even better things next year.

Football

The football team had captains
Phil Thompson and Rudd Smith to
lead the team back to a winning
record. The Generals finished with a
5-4 record, the state small college
championship and second place finish
in the C.A.C. While the shoes of
quarterback Andy Bloom will prove
the biggest to fill, next year’s captains
Scott MacKenzie and John Wolf will
lead an intact defensive team that
shut out three opponents this year.

With six home games and all-C.A.C.
selections John Wolf, Scott Mac-
Kenzie, John Harris and Charlie
Freret back, 1968 should be a good
year on the gridiron.

Soccer

The soccer team once again posted
a winning record while also winning
the state championship. Captains
Charlie Harrold and Allen Craig led
their team to a 7-3 record. With All-
Stater Scott Fechnay and Tom Mit-
chell as captains-elect for next year,
the soccer team should be strong
enough to successfully defend its
championship.

Cross-Country

While the cross-country team finish-
ed with a 3-5 record, many fine run-
ners return next year. Captain Corbet
Bryant and Bob Stack led this year’s
team to a second place in the C.A.C.
Next year’s captains are Ralph Pearcy
and Harry Zeliff.

Basketball

This year’s basketball team record-
ed a 19-6 record under captains Jody
Kline and Rob Bauer. And they won
the conference championship for the
second year in a row. Led by the
talented sophomore M-squad of Mel
Cartwright, Mal Wesselink, and Mike
Neer, the Generals should be even
better next year as only Kline will be
gone. Neer and John Carrere were
all-C.A.C. choices, and Rob Bauer
will captain next year’s team.

Rifle

The rifle team led by captain
Steve Pennil emerged with a 3-4
record. While riflle does not attract
a large following, the boys are no
less dedicated. Next year’s captains

Noel Clinard and Pat Costello cap-
tained the swimming team to a fine
6-2 record and a championship in the
C.A.C. Standouts for the season were

The wrestling team garnered a 3-8
record with Bobby Payne and Don

these two gone next year, and with
Jay Clarke and Razz Rasberry as
captains, they should improve. A sec-
ond place in the C.A.C. showed the
fine determination of this squad to
overcome other setbacks.

Baseball

Bill Rasmussen and Tom Mitchell
captained the Generals to an 8-10
record. Instrumental in bringing the
President’s Bell, for overall supremacy
of the C.A.C., to Lexington, was the
baseball team’s unexpected — third
place finish in the C.A.C. Tourna-
ment. Tom Mitchell and Jim Wilson
led the team throughout the season,
and capped their fine years by mak-
ing the C.A.C. tournament team.
They were also chosen to captain next
year’s team, which loses only two
players.

Track

The track team with Corbet Bryant
and Phil Norwood as captains, posted
a season mark of 3-4, and wound up
fourth in the C.A.C. track meet.
Outstanding all season for the Gen-
erals were Mike Neer and Sam

General Stickmen Close Year
With 17-4 Defeat Against UVa

By THUNDER THORNTON

Spectators at Wilson Field nearly
witnessed an upset Wednesday, as the
Wahoos of U.Va. did not come on
until the final moments of the second
period to move away to their 17-4
win over the Generals. Playing under
bright skies, the home forces jumped
out to a 2-1 lead to momentarily
cheer the vociferous crowd, but Vir-
ginia tied it before the end of the

quarter.

As the half was closing, the visi-
tors fired in five quick goals to move
to a comfortable halftime lead. In
led by
Messrs. Quayle with a total of four
goals and Morrow with three more,
brought the score to its final reading.

Croquet Finalists

Set for Sunday

In Golden Mallet Tournament

Approximately sixty spectators
viewed the skilled exhibition of twelve
members of the Lewis Carroll Croquet
and Cricket Society (LCC&CS) this
past Sunday in the initial elimination
round of “The Golden Mallet Tourna-
ment.” The finals of this croquet
extravaganza will be held this Sun-
day, May 19, at 2:00 p.m. on the
front lawn of Washington Hall and
will be co-sponsored by the LCC&CS
and the Mock Convention Secretariat.
James Harry Lowe, Grand Master of
the Society and Secretary of the
Convention, explained the participa-
tion of the Secretariat: “Croquet is
a dignified, slow-moving game, and
winning is not as important as playing
well. It is thus the most natural
game for Republicans.”

Last Sunday's round was high-light-
ed by the appearance of David B.
Dickens, Professor of German, repre-
senting the faculty. Hindered by in-
termittent thunder showers, Dickens
presented strong competition for the

Chosen were Bart Goodwin and
Charlie Stewart, the latter having
served as a captain this season. Coach
Szlasa expects these two veterans to
lead a sophomore and junior domi-
nated squad, with such returnees as
freshmen Whit Morrill and Bill Brum-
bach and sophomores Jay Meriwether,
Stan Lisle and Ned Coslett. Depart-
ing via graduation are two of the
starting attackmen, four midfielders
and two defensemen. Goalie Pete
Nowick, with 25 and 21 saves in the
last two games, will also return.
Changes in the schedule tentatively
pit the Generals against the likes of

a return to winning ways.

recording on the album that Art

Garfunkel collected from old age

| I listened at first and the album
| was pretty, Then it started to haunt,
It scared me next. This album hits
at the gut. Paul Simon and Art
Garfunkel are in the class of today’s
artists who do just that. Like Norman
Mailer, they paint a harsh picture of
this country that they love and the
people in it. John Steinbeck traveled
with Charlie. He pointed out a lot of
beautiful things in this country that
we no longer see. But he didn't
represent it as it really was because
he didn’t show us the frightening
people, those who were pretty when
they were young but have become
ugly with age. This is a land of
man’s dreams. Here we are given a
glimpse of what has become of some
recent dreams.

In “The Graduate,” Elaine's mother
told her it was too late for her to
follow her dream and run off with
Benjamin. “Not too late for me,”
was the answer. There are a lot of
older people in the country who miss-
ed the chance for their dreams to
come true. Maybe it was the depres-
sion, but we are luckier. We have a
chance. Now we are off to see
America.
