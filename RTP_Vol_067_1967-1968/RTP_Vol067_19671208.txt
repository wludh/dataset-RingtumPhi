President, Luke Crosland).

In past years the Fancy Dress Cock-

year, however, the LF.C. decided not
to sponsor this affair so that they

either the President of Fancy Dress

that he find some other source of

Va. Association of Student Gov’ts

Nash: Aims Are Too Vague

By RICHARD NASH
Student Body President

| have been asked by the Friday
Ring-tum Phi to summarize the rea-
sons that prompt-
ed the Executive
Committee to re-
ject membership
to the Virginia
Association of Stu-
dent Governments
by a vote of seven
to one at last Mon-
day’s weekly meet-
ing. According to
the discussion that
took place, the
following points
seemed to be the decisive ones in de-
termining the committee’s decision:

1, VASG has been in existence
for less than a year. Because it is
a newly formed organization,
VASG’s policies and directional
aims are still broad, vague, and
ill-defined. Just where it is headed
and what it intends to accomplish
is unknown to anyone at this time,
and thus, it would not be wise to
“jump in” without finding out more
about the organization,

2. At the present, as any student
organization would, VASG runs the
risk of becoming a “politically ori-
ented” group. This is what happened
to the National Student Association
as well as many lesser-known organi-
zations. Washington and Lee has never
desired to become affiliated with such
a group.

3. If at some later date, VASG
should adopt some proposal or policy
that was contradictory or even un-
favorable to Washington and Lee, we
would find ourselves in a position of
having to support it. Also, anyone
who knew of such a policy or pro-
posal would quite possibly know that
Washington and Lee was a member
of the organization supporting it. This
would, of course, not be in our best
interests. It might be argued that
there would probably be a “minority
opinion” list published, but these are
very seldom noticed by most people.

4. We might get into a key leader-
ship position and guide VASG with
out influence. However, it was later
noted that the core of leadership has
already been formed, and that Wash-
ington and Lee might very well be
put in a “follower” type of position.
This, too, would not be in our best
interests,

Lee is a uni

consensus seems to be that we would
no doubt gain “very little’ from such
an association with them

6. Probably the single most ap-
pealing reason for membership in
VASG would be the communications
established with the student leaders
of other schools. Much correspend-

ing names and faces facilitates cor-
respondence. However, Washington
and Lee sends delegates to several
conferences composed of Virginia
schools, and ample time for meeting
and getting to know leaders from
other schools is provided for at these
meetings.

All in all, Washington and Lee’s
membership in VASG would prob-
ably not hurt us. But there is al-
ways the slight chance that it would.
It may be trite to say that “we'd
rather be safe than sorry,” but that
is exactly how we feel.

At the present the disadvantages
appear to far outweigh the advantages
of our joining the Virginia Associa-
tion of Student Governments. How-
ever, should the organization, at a
later date, prove to be of potential
value and service to Washington and
Lee, we will always have the option
of joining then. Right now, that po-
tential value and service is not able
to be seen, and the Executive Com-
mittee has thus chosen not to affiliate.

The VASG Problem

On Monday evening the Executive Committee voted seven
to one to reject membership for W&L in the Virginia Associa-
tion of Student Governments (VASG).

Obviously, the EC acted in good faith in adopting a cauti-
ous, “wait-and-see”’ attitude. We doubt, however, that they
were prepared for the objections which were raised by a signi-
ficant number of students who feel that W&L may be caryying

its isolationism too far.

However sound the reasons behind the EC’s action may
be, we feel that the issue should by no means be considered
closed. Consequently, we have arranged to have on this page
two contrasting opinions which we hope will allow students to
make some sort of judgment of their own.

Neither writer necessarily represents the editorial opinion

of this newspaper.

 

 

Graham-Lee vs. Washington

 

150 Years of Literary Societies

By MIKE DUNN

We noticed recently that a group
of students has gotten together to
form a literary society. Their idea
is “to replace previous creative writ-
ing associations, either defunct or
presently serving other purposes.”
Reading this, we (1) were surprised
to find out there had been any previ-
ous literary associations at W&L, and
(2) decided to look into the subject.

* a bY

We soon found out that, of all
the activities at W&L, the literary
society holds the record for long-
evity: there has been at least one
around for about 150 of the past
158 years, and for most of that
time there were two.

* * *

The appeal of the literary society
may be lost on most of today’s fra-
ternity-type, down-the-road-on-Satur-
day-night W&L men. But picture
WAL to yourself as it was in 1809:
no cars, no girls and no girls’ schools
to put them in anyway, no flicks, no
tube, no Playboy, no Veemies—jusi
pure, unadulterated intellectualism.

In a situation like that, the only
apparent alternative was a literary
society. On Jan. 19, 1809, about ten
students got together and named them-

selves the Graham Society (later the

Graham Philanthropic Society, and
still later the Graham-Lee Literary
Society). The date was chosen at
random, of course, but later turned
out to be highly symbolic, being
Robert E. Lee's birthday.

Not to be outdone, another eight
students or so got together three
years later and became the Washing-

ton Society (later the Washington
Literary Society).
* * .

The societies used to meet on
Saturday nights. Since there were
only about 20 to 40 students in
the whole college anyway, they

legiate life in Lexington, The Gra-
ham Society was said to be the
more sedate of the two, while the
Washington group attracted the
“gayer class,” but both of them
got less and less literary as time
passed. College officials primly
noted that their literati were as-
sociating with “some of the most
riotous and dissipated youth of the
town,” locking themselves into their
meeting rooms on the third floor
of Washington Hall to drink,
smoke, and play cards until late
in the night.

The result, in 1829, was
first administration-fraternity battle,
as a result of which the two “lit-
erary” societies were forced to sweep
the bottles, cards, and dissipated
young men of the town out of their
meeting rooms and activities.

W&L’'s

* “s

Not that the societies gave up their
social character. In fact, they kept
up a bitter rivalry for new members,
establishing a tradition which later
became Rush Week for the fraterni-
ties. An island in the stream behind
the school became the battleground
for a number of distinctly non-lit-
erary pitched battles between the so-
cieties (until the stream changed
course in 1886 and the custom dis-
appeared with the island).

The societies did, however, begin
paying more attention to their in-
tellectual roles. At first, debate was
the main occupation, and the fervent
scholars of those years discussed such
topics as “Herod was justified in be-
heading John the Baptist” and “The
Louisiana purchase is inexpedient.”

But they also twice voted that no
state had the right to secede from
the Union, and their combined libar-

| ies (3500 books) outnumbered the col-

lege library (2000 books).

They found a happy medium,

not achieved, between social life
and intellectual endeavor, “Both
societies have been useful to their
members, and to the College,”
wrote a 19th-Century historian.
“Whatever discontent a student may
feel towards the faculty, he rarely
has anything to say against his
society, He feels that it belongs
to the “boys.” He loves it, and
takes pride in it. He is more at
home in its hall than anywhere
else. He enjoys its proceedings. He
labors for its prosperity. He wants
to do his full duty as a member.

And he carries from its associa-
tions pleasant memories that abide
with him through life. In all this
zeal for his society he is getting a
sort of education which he could
get from nothing else, and which is
of the greatest value as a prepara-
tion for active life.”

% ak 4

In 1909 and 1912, on their 100th
anniversaries, both societies were still
going strong, still prestigious and still
valuable training grounds. The Gra-
ham-Lee Society in 1914-15 produced
two men who later became diplomats,
one Virginia supreme court justice,
two educators, two missionaries, a
minister, and five lawyers.

Since the school had gotten very
much bigger, and fraternities were
beginning to make their appearance,
the societies no longer completely
dominated the campus scene; but it
would be a safe estimate to say that
as much as 20 per cent of the student
body belonged to one group or the
other. The annual inter-society debate
was considered so important that it
was held in conjunction with com-
mencement ceremonies in the spring

A typical program in those days
went:

(1) “a short but very appropriate
declamation on Washington and
Lee”

(2) “a beautiful poem rich in
pathos”

(3) “an eloquent oration entitled
‘Our Southern Heritage, ”

(4) debate on enacting a national
income-tax law (the judges decided
in favor of the negative).

Who killed the literary societies?
They began to die in the 30's, when
football made them give up their
Saturday meetings, and renovation
forced them out of their hundred-
year-old meeting halls in Washing-
ton Hall, Automobiles made dates
easier to find, and fraternity parties
and road trips began to draw more
crowds than declamations and ora-
tions. The biggest blow to the so-
cleties was probably sophistication:
“beautiful poems rich in pathos”
began to sound funny about thirty
years ago,

they had to offer with minstrel shows

Kessler: Could Not Hurt Us

By RON KESSLER
The recent Executive Committee
action rejecting W&L membership in
the Virginia As-
sociation of Stu-
dent Governments,

and the ‘Tuesday
Edition’s editorial
lauding said act-

ion has once again
shown Washington
and Lee to. the
world as the snot-
tiest of snobs. It
is no secret that
we are regarded
as incredible ego-
maniacs by other schools in the state;
this action has simply solidified this
position.

Evidently, our colleagues on the
Tuesday Edition are thoroughly con-
vinced as to their “stud image;” I
suppose we should be honored that
we are all included in this group,
however we are not so presumptuous,

fo quote the editorial in its en-
tirety is enough to illustrate our point:

“We find last night’s vote by the
Executive Committee overwhelm-
ingly rejecting membership in the
Virginia Association of Student
Governments—which wanted us to
associate with and lend our school’s
good name to a non-selective col-
lection of motley Virginia colleges
including the very dregs of Com-
monwealth education but not the
best, without recompense or bene-

fit of any sort to us, and with no
control over what the V.A.S.G.
would attach to our names—a most |
satisfying decision.”
“Our school’s good name” is be
stowed upon us by our school. W&L
is a damn good school, but surely
not so good that we cannot even
associate with other schools. It is
repulsive to think that we consider
ourselves too good; it is also absurd,
The so-called “non-selective col-
lection of motley Virginia colleges”
includes Hollins, UVa., Sweetbriar,
William and Mary, and VMI. We
doubt that they consider themselves
to be consorting with the “very dregs
of Commonwealth education
without recompense or benefit of any
sort. Even if this were true,
Le., that we would gain nothing at
the present, it could not possibly hurt

 

us to help the organization. But it is
not true. The standing committees to
which we would belong would indu-
bitably aid us.

The possible block billing of big
weekend entertainment would for its
sake alone make it worth joining, It
is altogether conceivable that mem-
ber-schools of VASG would receive
discounts at weekends of other mem-
ber-schools. Our colleagues on the
Tuesday Edition would most gain
from our participation on the Editors
Committee, “aimed at improvement
of college and university newspapers”
(VASG Handbook),

Steve Sandler and Danny Leonard,
Sophomore Executive Committeemen
attended the Fall Conference of the
VASG with the understanding that
they would report to the EC their
findings and make recommendations
concerning membership. Mr. Sandler
was impressed with what he saw, and
recommended to the committee that
W&L join the organization.

Mr. Leonard voted in the majority,
i.@., against joining, stating that it
wouldn't hurt to wait and see how
the organization develops,

The Editor of the Tuesday Edition
attended the Executive Committee
meeting, and observed to the com-
mittee that it would be unfortunate
if Washington and Lee’s “good name”
were to be associated with “polls”
of the member-schools of the VASG,
assuming that W&L voted in the
minority of such a poll.

Evidently, the Tuesday Editor fears
that the VASG will inevitably take
political stands a la the Nationai
Student Association (membership in
which the W&L student body over-
whemingly rejected two years ago).
However, there is no official indica-
tion that such polls or stands will be
taken by the VASG; to conject that
such polls will occur is unfair to the
organization and is ludicrous.

The Tuesday Edition’s lead article
states, “EC consensus said it
would be better to wait and see how
[the VASG] develops and in what
directions it moves.” Perhaps it has
not occurred to the seven dissenting
members of the Executive Committee
that W&L’s influence could very well
move the direction of the VASG in
a favorable direction. Our absence
from it may very well destroy it.

Generals Annihilate Rams 61-40
In Unimpressive Doremus Debut

By SHELDON MILLER

Washington and Lee’s basketball
Generals made their 1967-68 debut
in Doremus Gymnasium Tuesday
night with an unimpressive 61-40 vic-
tory over R.P.I. In a game that started
and ended with floor mistakes, the
Rams’ “slow-down” ball was not con-
clusive to an exciting or well-played
contest,

After four minutes of Ram_ ball
control, Steve Harvey pumped in a
jump shot to open the scoring for the
visitors, and with 13:30 remaining in
the half, the Generals were down by
an excruciating five points, 8-3.

Ihe Generals finally took the lead
11-10 on a Mel Cartwright free throw
with 3:46 left in the half, and im-
mediately thereafter went into a very
effective and obviously well-disciplin-
ed full-court press which forced the
Rams into three quick turnovers, all
resulting in baskets for the Blue.
When the buzzer sounded ending the
half, the Generals, thanks to an ex-
cellent pressure defense but with very
little assistance from a_ sluggish
offense, led 28-12.

Second Half Strategy

fense in the second half, W&L held

With ten minutes remaining, Verne
Canfield unloaded his bench and gave
the second-stringers a chance to see
some action. They came through
admirably, with freshman Bill Rhyne
dropping in two long jumpers, Charlie
Stone playing heads-up defense, and
Earl Edwards, Rob Bauer, and Stu

at both ends of the court.

The “Three M’s” Return

The first team, after five minutes’
rest, came back to finish the game.
Led by the “Three M’s,” Mel (Cart-
wright), Mal (Wesselink), and Mike
(Neer), the Generals remained in con-
trol and left the court 61-40 victors.

A Soggy Saga

Another brilliant chapter was
written yesterday in the saga of
Doremus Gymnasium; when the
Washington and Lee swimming
team proved once again that
it's not how you play the game,
but if you win or lose, as the
tankers won a victory by default
over Roanoke College due to the
interesting fact the Roanoke Col-
lege does not have a swimming
team.

“We scheduled them knowing
this might happen,” swimming
coach Bill Stearns commented, “as
they were having trouble finding
enough swimmers.”

The Generals will try to even
their season mark at 1-1 Saturday
when they face Gettysburg at 1:00
in Doremus, Coach Stearns has as-
sured the Ring-tum Phi that Gettys-
burg has a team.

Against Tarheels
Tomorrow Night

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team will attempt to avenge last
year’s 29-0 thrashing by the Univer-
sity of North Carolina (Chapel Hill)
tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m. in
Doremus Gymnasium, Last year was
the first time since 1925 that the
Tarheels had defeated a W&L wrestl-
ing team and Coach Dick Miller
hopes to make it the last.

North Carolina has only two re-
turning lettermen, while everyone on
the well-balanced W&L squad has
lettered previously except the two
freshmen.

The Generals on the road last
weekend defeated Galaudet School
for the Deaf in Washington 28-8. Fri-
day night, but lost to a strong Towson
squad 26-11 in Baltimore on Satur-
day night. Helping the W&L effort
were:

Raz Razberry, a sophomore wrestl-
ing 123, was pinned at Gallaudet, but
pulled out an 10-8 victory at Towson.
Freshman Whit Morrill wrestling his
first college bout at 130 won by a
forfeit at Galladuet but, unfortunately
drew one of Towson’s better wrestlers
and lost 7-2. Last year’s oustanding
freshman wrestler Mark Hendrickson
won, wrestling 137, at Galladuet, 3-2,
but lost 10-7 at Towson.

Loss On Fluke

In the 145 pound class co-captain
Bobby Paine, a senior, wiped up at
Galladuet, 11-2, but was pinned by a
fluke at Towson while he was win-
ning 6-0. The other co-captain, Don
O’Har, a senior won at Galladuet
5-2, at 162, but also lost at Towson
3-1. Dan Higgins, a sophomore was
also successful at Galladuet winning
6-3, at 160. But he was up against
Towson’s most outstanding wrestler
and was pinned.

At 167, Holmes Raker a senior,
won at Gallaudet 7-0 but also was
pinned at Towson while winning 4-2.

The Mediocre
WBA Tourney

boxing. Boxing has become a_busi-
ness, and as such, fighters are being
guided by CPA’s rather than fight
managers. No longer are boxers
trained, taught, and fostered by the
managers of old. Their careers are
guided with one thought in mind—
how to secure the fast buck and the
instant success.

The number of really good fight
managers stands at one—Angelo Dun
dee. And so great has the business
image of the fight game become,
that boxers such as Clay even ignore
the competent advice of a few men
around who know what they're doing.

Mistaken Assumption
Not only are those involved with
boxing fooling themselves by think-
ing that a money-oriented tournament
such as the present farce can produce
any real indication of a champion,

but the American public is being
swept along on the wave of con
census,

Let me propose a panacea equal
in logic to the WBA _ tournament.
First, complete the tournament in its
present form. Next, having duly pro-
claimed a champion, check and see
if there are any Pete Radamachers
available to challenge the champ.
Finally, having milked all these pos-
sibilities dry, organize a barnstorm-
ing tour in which the WBA champ
will face all comers the world over.
There must be a few rubes with a
few coins who deserve to see boxing
at its best.

Webster who wrestled 177 was one
of two double winners. Webster
pinned his Gadulet opponent and had
no trouble disposing of his Towson
adversary, 4-0. Jay Clarke, a junior
wrestling 191, also won twice for
the Generals through he was wrestl-
ing much above his actual weight. He
won at Gadulet, 5-4, and at Towson,
3-0. Junior Bobby Paine, at heavy-
weight, was also much above his
actual weight and his opponents were
quite large. He lost 5-4 at Gadulei
and drew 5-5 at Towson

tensive program of renovation for the
Troubadour Theater, Renovation will

College Inn Reopens Resin

over by the third generation, was
begun in 1937 by Steve Neofotis when
he opened Steve's Diner on North
Main (it is still owned by the Neofotis
family but rented to others). Steve
came from New York where he had
previously owned restaurants on
Broadway. The Diner was a favorite
stomping ground for both students and
faculty of both schools. Former cus-
tomers from the old days still come
back and ask for Steve, now 81, re-
tired, and on a visit to Greece. He
is credited with bringing New York
food to Lexington.

professional middleweight fighter
opened the “old” College Inn next
door to the present one, Pete, a

great sports fan, gave up pro-fighting
at the insistence of his wife, and was
trained in his father’s restaurants.

the old atmosphere present when the
Neofotis’ were running it. Now with
the leasing of their other restaurant,
the Neofotis’ turn their attention to
reviving the famous College Inn.

The family can hardly wait to get
the College Inn open and the students
from past years who remember the
old Inn, are just as impatient. Mrs.
Neofotis stated that people have been
calling and asking her on the sireet
when they would reopen. Only time
will tell!
