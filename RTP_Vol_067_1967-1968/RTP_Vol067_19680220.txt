FROGS To Produce ‘Patience’

“With the grace of God, the help
of the Kiwanis Club, and the sup-
port of the people of Lexington,”
said Professor De Vogt, “the FROGS
are working to produce Patience.”

The FROGS (Friends and Relations
Of Gilbert and Sullivan) will present
the Gilbert and Sullivan opera Pa-
tience or Bunthorne’s Bride on March
21, 22, and 23 at the Lylburn Down-

the aesthetic craze of the late 19th
century patterned after the satiric
content of Oscar Wilde’s comedies of
the period. Professor De Vogt com

The funds were given to cover the
cost of subscriptions to the Law Re-

‘Choice ‘68’ is a poll of college

Player of the year

The Tuesday Edition, which has honored one member of the
basketball team each Tuesday as “Player of the Week” in
recognition of exceptional performances during each seven-day
period, tonight presents its “Player of the Year’ plaque,
given for the most outstanding and consistent season-long per-
formance.

The presentation will directly precede tonight’s Emory
and Henry game, our last home game of the year. Tuesday
Sports Editor Steve Mason has been keeping a systematized
“point” chart all season, with tonight’s presentation in mind.

Nobody who has been to very many of this year’s basket-
ball games will deny, though, that in this case the total is far
greater than the sum of its parts. The team has been superb.
The Coach has been superb. The morale, the obvious close
fellowship among all team members, has certainly been re-
sponsible. Any team which can keep on top as ours has
(and when things go badly, as they did in Roanoke, any team
which right afterwards can come within eight points of Old
Dominion and destroy another team, 103 to 68) has a spirit
that a college can be proud of.

The Ring-tum Phi is proud. And so tonight, when the |

Player of the Year award is presented, keep in mind that it
not only recognizes the contribution of one team member
to W&L’s basketball program. It is a symbolic presentation
to the Team of the Year.

After the flood

May we use the opportunity created by Friday morning's
Troubadour Theatre flood to reiterate our vehement opposi:
tion to the continued existence of the building?

On a lot of matters, the Tuesday Edition’s admittedly con-
servative, even reactionary, attitude is not one of hasty, single-
minded, end-in-itself Change. But when it comes to the Troub
Theatre, that is too much. The situation cries out for almost
any kind of change, because things can’t become much worse.
(Perhaps they could become as bad as they were last year
before the micro-renovation—worse than which does not
exist, we are certain. God keep us from that.)

The University is in the process of prescribing priorities to
its long-range projects; and we are assured that few if any will
be given priority over the construction of a new theatre and
gym. None the less, it seems apparent now, in a post-diluvian
analysis, that the construction of a theatre (the existing build-
ing not qualifying for the dignity of being called a “theatre”’)
needs to be taken out of the long-range program and, as the
student union was, planned and executed immediately. Perhaps
some of the funds given by the “Lee Associates” could be
earmarked for this specific purpose. Certainly, though, some-
thing besides water must be channelled to the Troub Theatre,
very, very soon.

 

Staff editorial:

Eton’s fields

Washington and Lee's equivalent to the playing fields of
Eton—the hillsides of Natural Bridge—has produced leaders
in the past; but to a great extent the success of our alumni
has been the consequence of their ability to overcome the effects
of having gone to Freshman Camp. Recent proposals that
SEX Education be introduced to the format of that three-day
bacchanalia illustrate that the aspects of a nice, big prep school
shall remain with us always.

Not that SEX Education, per se, is a force of great evil,
but the memories conjured are ones of some of the greatest
flicks that were ever seen in eighth grade, such as “Where
Babies Come From,” and the classic “Social Disease.”’ Naive
as I was, I expected the flick to be about Jean-Jacques Rous-
seau.

However, the reaction of freshmen to such titillating ma-
terial is liable to be laughter. The majority of high school
graduates have been exposed repeatedly to the basics of sex
education, and I would submit that if they haven't at least a

One of the basic requirements of a
modern, efficient library is the pos-
| sion of a complete and useful micro-
film library with a large number of
available microfilm-viewing machines.
| Timesaving and convenient, a cabinet-
drawer full of microfilm can replace
a roomful of bound volumes of news-
papers. The questions which now
arise are: how much use is being
made of microfilm and microfilm ma-
chines in McCormick Library, and
are plans being made to increase the
amount and use of microfilm at Wash-
ington and Lee?

At the moment, the
possesses two machines for
film viewing. The machines which are
kept in the study room behind the
main stack level, are available from

matter of microfilms themselves, re-
cent editions of “Newsweek” are
available on film, as well as every
edition of the New York Times since

War Between the States.
Henry E. Coleman stated that an
agreement exists with the publishers
of both “Newsweek” and the Times
so that current issues of these publi-

put on microfilm. Thus, the library
has, and will continue to have, a
compact, up-to-date file on these two
periodicals.

Not Even Adequate

Although it is a start, Washington
and Lee's collection of microfilm can-
not be termed complete, or even ade-
quate. Mr. Coleman, for one, would
particularly like the gap between
1865 and 1930 for the
filled. While this project would cost
approximately $6,000, Mr. Coleman
feels that the money will in time be
made available.

of sociology, gave what he felt was
the faculty’s view of microfilm when

productive faculty, microfilm is prac-
tically required in facilitating study.”

| Two basic problems involve, in Mr.

before complete resources of micro-
film and microfilm equipment can be
acquired. Shortly, however, the ground
floor of the library will be available
for expansion. Plans are being made
for the purchase of more machines
for viewing and for more microfilm to

No Classes On Saturday:

Simple And

By LARRY HONIG

The University of Virginia’s recent
faculty action to abandon classes on
Saturday leaves Washington and Lee
as one of the dwindling number of
colleges which have a six-day school
week. Student opinion on this campus
again seems oriented toward desiring
the abolition of Saturday classes.

A referendum of the student body
took place in 1965, which showed
inconclusively (385-275) that students
did not wish to abolish Saturday
classes. I say “inconclusively,” be-
cause the overall editorial bent in both
campus papers as well as the word-
ing of the referendum ballot itself
was undeniably in favor of the status
quo,

At that time, the general impres-
sion was that no Saturday classes
necessarily meant afternoon classes
or very long classes or both. Here,
then, is a presentation of the argu-

ments for and against Saturday
classes, with an admittedly biased
discussion of the most logical and

appealing alternative. (This alterna-
tive plan is the idea of a faculty
member.)

Pro

Saturday classes present a problem
to almost everyone in almost every
respect. As one faculty member puts
it, “We're just like other men. We'd
like to have Saturday mornings to
sleep, to catch up on our homework,
to play golf, to spend time with the
kids.”

 

A referendum will take place
within the next few weeks on the
question of Saturday classes. The
wording will present a yes-no choice
along the lines of the proposal in
this article.

If a sufficient number of stu-
dents vote in favor of the alternate
proposal, this edition of the Ring-
tum Phi will submit the results to
the faculty for consideration.

 

 

The Making Of A R-t Phi; Or
The Fine Art Of Newspapering

One department head maintains that
the faculty would be overwhelmingly
in favor of not having Saturday
classes—provided:

@ Class periods are equal in length,

no longer than an hour each.

@ Each class meets the same num

ber of times.

In addition, certain segments of the
faculty, such as the science and physi
cal education departments, are op-
posed to afternoon classes.

Class periods of equal length, about
an hour, are necessary according to|
most faculty members with whom 1)
have talked, in order to assure that |
each professor has clases for the same |
amount of time (who could take an}
hour-and-and-a half quiz?). To maxi-

of them are work hours. There are
allotted somewhere between 10 and
12 working hours during which the
type for either edition of The Ring

tum Phi may be set. It follows, then,
that no more than 300 column-inches
of type can be set for a Ring-tum
Phi—and, because of headlines, cor

rections and so on, the total

is

“IT DROPPETA AS THE GENTLE

Logical Plan

mize student attention in lecture
courses, educators say that periods of
50 minutes to an hour are best.

Each class must meet the same
number of times, the antithesis rais-
ing the complex problem of “Which
class should meet how often?”

To students, having to go to school
on Saturday means less time to re-
cuperate on weekends, less time for
intensive studying (although the vali-
dity of this is doubtful), difficulty in
dating, and limited chances to say,
spend the weekend in Washington.

There are many, many alternative
plans to having Saturday classes. Ap-
parently, the most acceptable alterna-
tive—to both faculty and students—
is the following:

Increase class periods to 60 minutes,
with 5 minutes between classes (regu-
lated by bells). The day would begin
at 8:00; the last class would end at
1:20,

Presently, classes meet six times in
each two-week period for a total of
300 minutes. (While classes are nomi-
nally 55 minutes long, it works out

Swimmers Drown Loyola

The Generals rolled over the Loyola
swimming team, defeating them by a
66-38 margin. David Kympton led
the charge in the individual events
winning two, while Billy Ball, Bill
Brumback, and Ross Forman each
participated in the two winning relays
as well as winning one individual
event apiece.

Tonight at 7:30 the W&L swim-
mers host the University of West Vir-
ginia in the last home meet of the
year. The Generals have consistently
been able to defeat West Virginia in
the past, but this year is the first
year that West Virginia’s freshmen
are eligible so that this meet may
be one of the best of the year.

In the Loyola meet the natators
broke 10 existing records. Billy Ball
led of the 400 yard medley relay
by breaking both the pool and school
record in the 100 yard backstroke.
Ball’s time of 53.3 seconds helped
pace the relay which also broke a
pool and school record with a win
of Ball (backstroke), Costello (breast-
stroke), Brumback (butterfly), and
Forman (freestyle) combined for a
winning time of 3:37.9 seconds in
WA&L’'s 23% yard pool.

In the final relay, the 400 yard
freestyle relay team of Brumback,
Ball, Catlin, and Forman set a new
pool and school record with a win-

Tuesday, p.m.

ning time of 3:08.4 seconds. Brum-
back leading off, set a new pool and
school record for the 100 yard free-
style with the time of 46.3 seconds
breaking a record he held by sixth
tenths of a second.

David Kympton scored a first in
both the 1000 and the 500 yard free-
style events. Kympton’s time in the
43 length 1000 yard event of 11:53.4
seconds set a new school record; the
pool record being held by West Vir-
ginia Weselyan set last week. Chuck
Garten came in third in the 1000
while Dave Frankstone captured third
in the 500 yard event.

The records continued to fall as
freshman Hal Catlin broke his own
school record in the 200 yd. free-
style event with a winning time of
1:48.5; Jeff Grossman scored a third
in this event for the Generals, After
5 events Coach Stearns’ team was
ahead 30-13 and the outcome of the
meet was never in doubt. The Gen-
erals were up for Loyola, for the
Baltimore team had defeated them a
year before by a one point margin
47-48.

In the 50 yard freestyle sprint,
Brumback won a decisive first with a
winning time of 21.1 seconds. In the
200 yard individual medley, Ball cap-
tured a first and Bill Kimmel a third.

Ball Faced Facts

By RIC BERARD
Last Friday night, Washington and
Lee’s swimming team humiliated
Loyola of Baltimore, 66-38. While
Coach Stearns
might have eased
up late in the meet
against the Free
State squad, he and
the team were out
to show our Visi-
tors that last
year’s 48-47 loss in
Baltimore wasn't
for real. And, con-
sidering the margin
of victory, I be-
lieve the oppsition
was sufficiently impressed, particularly
since they were drawn and quartered
without the appearance of our No, |
diver and co-captain, Noel Clinard,
who was out with a bad back.
Naturally, with records falling left
and right throughout the meet, Billy
Ball had to be having another of his

, “successful” nights. Yet unlike most
| mortals, a “successful” night for Ball
does not constitute winning or losing,
but rather how many time he breaks
into the record book. While winning
| isn’t a foregone conclusion with Ball,
| it's hard to imagine any other out-
lcome. On Friday, Bill broke the
school and pool record for the back-
stroke in the 400 yard individual
medley and was the no. 2 man on
the record-breaking 400 yard free-
style relay.

To talk with Ball about swimming
is a wonderful experience. He epito-
mizes the accomplished athlete. With
the poise and confidence of a winner,
Bill exudes “class.” Although he cur-
rently holds four pool and school
records at W&L as a backstroker, he

Florida Trip Proves Unsuccessful;
Roundballers Return Home Tonight

The Generals’ basketball team
found the weather pleasant but the
Opposition very unpleasant on_ its
Florida trip last weekend, bowing to
West Florida College, 85-64, in Pen-
sacola Friday night, and to Florida
Presbyterian, 74-71, in St. Petersburg
Saturday evening.

Friday night’s class was a meeting
of two teams with identical 17-3 rec-
ords. In the game, the Argonauts of
West Florida proved that they are

 

worthy of their ranking among the

nation’s top twenty small college
teams.
W.F.C. used a tight man-to-man

defense which succeeded in holding
W&L’s “Big Three” of center Mike
Neer, and forwards Mel Cartwright
and Mal Wesselink to 26 points, 22
below their season average. Cartwright
and Wesselink had 9 apiece and Neer
8. Guards John Carrere and Nor-
wood Morrison led the Generals with
14 and 12 points respectively. The
Argonauts featured a well balanced
attack with five players in double

 

 

Player of

For the first time, one of
the Generals’ little men de-
serves recognition as the
Player of the Week. John
Carrere has turned in con-
sistently fine performances
all year and in the past
week’s games he has done
an outstanding job. Against
West Florida he led the Gen-
erals in scoring with 14 and
did a fine job of leading
the offense. Against Florida
Presbyterian John did a
“fine floor job” as the team
almost came back to win.
While Cartwright, Neer and
Wesselink have been gath-
ering most of the laurels
this year it has been the con-
sistent play of Carrere that
has been a major determin-
ing factor in the team’s suc-
cuess. John provides the out-
side scoring threat that is so
vital to taking the pressure
off the big men.

figures, paced by Bob Stinnett and
Doug Linville with 20 apiece.

The game was close until late in
the first half, when West Florida
scored six straight points, four by
Stinnett, to stretch a one point lead
to 30-23 with 1:32 left in the half.
W.F.C. led by nine, 39-29, at halftime,
and was not challeneged thereafter.

The Generals were hampered by
poor foul shooting, 10-22, and missed
opportunities due to mental errors.
Coach Verne Canfield summed up
the Generals’ performance by stating,
“We were bombed. We didn’t do any-
thing right.” He reserved his only
praise for guards Carrere and Morri-
son.

The Big Blue turned in a far better

performance Saturday night. After
Florida Presbyterian took a 57-45
halftime lead, the Generals rallied

behind an adjusted defense, falling
just short. W&L twice pulled within
one point durin gthe waning moments
of the game; 70-69 on a field goal

Concerning his press duties in Wash-

Vietnam is an old subject for M.

On Swimming

(Continued from page 3)

speaks not of himself but of swim-
ming and the team.

When I asked Billy about the fresh-
men on the team, the conversation
immediately centered on Bill Brum-
back. Hal Catlin and Mike Carrere.
According to Ball, “when you speak
in terms of greatness among swim-
mers, a guy either has it or he doesn’t.
Brumback has got it... but Catlin’s
pushing him.” And, with deference
to diving ace, Mike Carrere, and
the future of the team, Ball blurted:
“Oh, Mike’s really good right now.
Next year ought to be one of the
best teams W&L has ever seen, par-
ticularly if Coach Stearns can recruit
a couple of the boys he’s contacted.”

But more than Stearns’ recruting
| efforts have impressed Ball. In_ his
succinct manner, Billy finds his coach
“good,” knowledgeable, abreast of all
the latest techniques and a great guy,
which —coming from an athlete
familiar with Olympic coaching —
isn’t bad at all. And then, without
any prompting, Bill offered: “You
know, we're (the swimming team) just
like the basketball team. And so is
our coach.” Hmmmmm.,

Well, tonight is our last regular
meet. We face tough West Virginia
University which is now not only
subsidized but also using freshman on
their varsity team, While comparative
time indicate West Virginia will have
the edge, they are going to need a
great deal to beat out several Blue
swimmers. Among them is Ball. The
action starts at 7:30 p.m.

Whatever the outcome of tonight's
effort, however, Bill is pointing to the
CAC tournament which he flatly pre-
dicts “we'll win.” For although he
allows for last year’s champs, Se-
wanee, improving some, he sees WAL
a much stronger team. And with
guys like Willis Manville, Ill, on the
team, you gotta like our odds,

much, much earlier (the sports page,
for example, Ric, would have a dead-
line of at least 48 hours before publi-
cation). A reduction in advertising to
a non-existenent level,
would require a far-more-than-doubl-
ing of the students’ current contribu-
tion to this newspaper.

If the Ring-tum Phi were to print
SIX pages, Cosis—not counting type-
setting—would be exactly double the
cost of printing four pages. The in-
crease, logically, would not be worth-
while. We can expand our size—in-
crease text and reduce ads, avoid
“jumping” articles to the back page,
maintain reasonable deadlines—-and
not require three or four times as
much money from every student as
we do, Costs would increase far, far
beyond the proportion of size in-

creases.
Epilogue

Adevrtisers are, then, the lifeblood
of the Ring-tum Phi (may they ever
prosper). So are pictures (which do
not take away from Linotyping-time).

And finally, let it be pointed out
that no commercial newspaper in the
world devotes as little speace to ad-
vertising as does the Ring-tum Phi,
A 50-50 ratio, ads to news, is con-
sidered desirable by most; none de-
| viate more than 10 or 15 per cent
from that. The Ring-tum Phi's ratio
is 25-75, ads to news, and often con-
siderably less,

three times in one week, two times

that each class still meets 300 minutes
in two weeks.
Here’s the way it would work:

This plan would adhere to the fac-
ulty’s desire for equal-length periods
(all are 60 minutes) and equal num-
ber of meeting times (5 meetings per
clas sin every two weeks).

The benefit to students under this
plan is that they will be able to at-

points, 19 in the first half, and pulled
down 17 rebounds. He was ably
supported by Marvin Clemons, 18
points, Stone, 16, and John Criswell,
15.

Coach Canfield felt that his team
played a fine ball game, but again
suffered from mental errors. Twice
the Generals had foul shots nullified
when a player stepped into the lane
too early. Coach Canfield expressed
the opinion that Saturday's night's
game might have been a turning point
for W&L. “The whole team felt the
loss deeply. We were still suffering
from the effects of a 15 day layoff,
but should be ready for our tough-
est week of the year.” He went on to
point out that Presbyterian had a
fine team, owning a 103-79 victory
over Stetson, a team that was in-
vited to the NCAA small college
tournament last Spring.

The Generals, now with a 16-5
marks, face stiff competition this
week. Tonight, in the final home
game of the season, W&L will be
opposed by Emory & Henry. E&H
has back the same team that bested
the Generals in overtime last year.
In pre-game ceremonies, the Ring-tum
Phi will present its Palyer of the Year
award. Tomorrow night, the Gen-
erals will travel to Greenville, N. C.
to take on major college foe East

Serious objections
from the faculty:

1) Having only two classes in one
of the weeks would be too small a
number of meetings to hold attention
until the next week. This seems a
valid point, although not wholly true.

2) Students’ weekend trips would
get out of hand. This argument is
considered quite seriously by some
faculty members; they cite a potential
rise in automobole accidents and a
diversion from school.

In the 100 yard frestyle, Ross For-
man blasted his way to a first with
a winning time of 48.2 seconds. The
only two events the natators lost all
evening was the 200 yard butterfly
and the 200 yard backstroke. In the

schools and nearly all co-ed schools—
will result in students’ being mentally

during the week.

And also, without
sound precocious, in

But the students have reservations,
too:

1) The day would be long. 8:00
is early, even though most colleges

1:25 is pretty late, meaning that
lunch would be half an hour later,
as would afternoon seminars and labs.

2) The somewhat-complicated week-
ly class meeting changes would be
easy to forget. I think, however, a
simple written schedule in notebooks
would suffice until routine facilitated
mastery.

The preceding arguments are limit-
ed, | admit, in that they are con-
cerned with only one proposal. But
the proposal is one which would
create a minimum of transitional
havoc and a maximum of faculty and
student benefit. The time for change—
