IFC-Faculty Coffee Date
Changed to Thursday
After Thanksgiving

Ihe date of the IFC-Faculty coffee
has been changed to November 30,
IFC President Ellis Zahra announced
last night at the regular meeting.
The topic for the coffee remains “De
ferred Rush,” and it is hoped that
there will be a debate on the subject
also,

On the subject of deferred rush, the
IFC plans to write the national head
quarters of the 18 fraternities to find
out their concerning the suc-
cess or failure of deferred rush plans
at other chapters.

On the matter of freshman pledg-
ing-to-come, Zahra asked that fra-
ternities use discretion and temper-
ance in their requirements of pledges
after the mid-semester. He also said
that activities may not begin until
all the pledges have picked up their
grades at the end of this week.

As passed by the outgoing IFC of
year, a freshman who makes
than a 1.5 at the mid-semester
may not be required to do anything
by the fraternity. If his grades remain
below 1.5 at the semester, he is aulo
matically de-pledged

Professor David B. Dickens and

tee sent their thanks to the IFC for

cation. The requesting upper-

situation will be resolved later this
week.

Mid-Term Exam Reform

The EC considered the complex
problems of attempting to ease the
“unfair burden” of mid-semester tests
in which many students have to take
three or four important hour tests
within a two-day period. Herb Cren-
shaw moved that the University should
send a letter to the parents explain-

ing fully the meaning of mid-term
grades: how they are derived and

their ultimate influence on the stu-

requested interviews with |

Gar- |

| dent’s semester grade.

| A part of the Crenshaw
resolution stated that administrative
| grades should be completely abolish-
ed, but if a professor has no alterna-
but to give an administrative
grade it should be marked as such
and explained on the mid-semester
report. Steve Sandler seconded this
motion which passed 8-0.

Wick Vellines then moved that mid
term hour tests be scheduled in a
manner similar to that of the final
exams. This resolution passed 5-3
In favor were Jody Kline, Wick
Vellines, Lee Halford, Herb Cren-
shaw and Butch West. Those opposed
were Joe Matthews, Steve Sandler and
Joe Tompkins. Absent were Gil Faulk,
Dan Leonard and Pete Hendricks.
The sentiment of some of those op-
posed to the motion seemed to be
that this woul lead to the ultimate
creation of a “little exam period.”

In other action last night the EC
heard Barry Levin request a resolu-
tion supporting Fancy Dress Presi

An Excess of Stupidity |

The weekend’s series of homecoming-display-burnings is
one of the most irresponsible things anybody on this campus
has done in a long, long while. Just when fraternities most need
a sense of solidarity, when they most need to present some sort
of non-pernicious image, wholesale malicious destruction, such
as the late arson, cannot but hurt—and hurt a lot, for a long
time. We saw the Lambda Chi display go up—and still find it
hard to believe that anybody could have done it, hoping to go
undetected. The display was ON the front of the house, not
constructed out in the yard; it was ignited while more than a
hundred people were IN the house. (Any “might-have-hap-
pened” thinking is unstomachable.) Why? There isn’t even
any major rivalry between the Lambda Chi’s and Kappa Sigs
(three of whose members allegedly set the fire). Sour grapes
because Lambda Chi won first place in the display contest
again this year?

 

The burning of other displays, out in the yards well re-
moved from the houses, which took place before we knew
of the house-burnings, had annoyed us because it showed
an infantile disregard for the efforts of others (the award.
winning displays were almost all among the first to go—who
are other students to decide when these displays ought to be
destroyed?) . But the ultimate, as practiced against the Lambda
Chi house, is inexcusable. (The Sigma Chi house burning,
of which nobody has yet been officially accused, occurred under
similar and equally repelling circumstances—and was the
result, apparently, of about the same guttural level of conduct

as the Lambda burning.)

We are glad nobody thinks highly at all of students who
find their kicks burning houses, not just displays. We are

glad nobody thinks very highly at all of members of the guilty

house who talked in class Saturday morning of the house’s
plans to burn one or more displays that night.

But we’re not glad of the inevitable effect such senseless
viciousness has on fraternities as a whole. The fire department
is not happy; neither are the police; neither is the Hill. We
like the system, and want it to prosper. At this rate, though,
it simply won't. This weekend's drastically misplaced enthus-

iasm (to put it as benignly as possible) is the biggest single |

windfall of ammunition the system’s enemies could ever have

hoped for. If anything can “kill” fraternities, this sort of |

thing is it. People don’t have to look to anti-democracy, anti
intellectualism, anti-individualism, the potential human de
gradation brought on by pledge programs or any other theore-
ticals. They have this, and this may well be enough.

Should Faculty
Enforce W&L’s

Dress ‘Custom’?

The following remarks were ad-
dressed to the alumni on Oct. 7 and
were offered in the context of a
statement by Dr, Duvall suggest-
ing the problems of getting and
keeping a first-rate faculty at 2
small liberal arts college; the com-
ment was interpolated in response
to alumni concern for the apparent
lapse of conventional dress, and
particularly to one suggestion that
students be admitted only upon an
agreement to abide by customs of
the University.

By SEVERN P, C, DUVALL

Professor of English and
Chairman of the Department

. Now let me flick the red flag
at you (and the metaphor was con-
sciously chosen). I can’t let pass the
opportunity to speak out here as a
faculty member and as an Admissions
Committee member on the issue of
dress which you raised yesterday—
and to speak bluntly.

For myself, for nearly all of the
faculty members on the Admissions
Committee, and for a significant num-
ber of newer faculty members (and,
I would be willing to guess, for a very
large number of the total faculty), I
think the faculty would turn you down

yesterday about qualifying admission

in a certain away.

And I think that we would turn
it down on the basis of the very
virtues we have and the dangers we
as faculty members have to oppose.

| am speaking now for those of us
who were concerned about your con-
cern yesterday. I should say paren-
thetically that I too, like a student
who maintains the customs (ways of
dress of are customs rather
than traditions): | grew up amid such
customs myself: one of your natural
enemies [The University of Virginia]
also had a custom of this kind

Cocktail Party
Leads To Chaos

At Inauguration

Love, ‘tis said, and alcohol make
the world go round. And specially at
inaugurations of university presidents,
it seems. Consider Wesleyan (the
Wesleyan, that is). They installed a
new one a couple of weeks back, and
a many-splendored affair to remem-
ber it was.

“Virtually all [at the reception after-
wards, when things got really lively]
were consuming prodigious quantities
of alcohol!” cried an incensed fresh-
man letter-to-the-editor writer. (Like
ad-writers for two-star novies, we
add the ! “for emphasis only.”)

“Uninvited students wishing to at-
tend the reception were — stealing
through the side doors, and were even
approaching departing guests, request-
ing that the now-uneeded invitations
be donated to them!”, Carrie-Nation-
come-lately invected.

And, shame of shames, “After
gaining admission through misrepre-
sentation and stealth [!], these in-
terlopers, rather than conduct them-
selves appropriately, proceeded to con-
sume liquor earmarked for invited
guests and attain varied states of in-

Generals’ Offense Scores

Big Homecoming Triumph

By RIC BERARD

For the 3500 spectators, last Satur-
day’s football game against South-
western promised
to be a long and
dreary affair. After
all, the Generals
had just lost the
preceding “mis-
match” between
themselves and
Sewanee, 43-0, and
it was Sewanee
who in turn had
succumbed to the
Lynx, 31-16. In
addition, South-
western had a great

 

BERARD

deal of momentum accrued from its.

last three victories in a row as its
aerial game seemed to be maturing
at a startling rate with each passing
victory. And, last but not least, their
offensive and defensive lines left pock
marks wherever they ambled on Wil-
son Field.

Unfortunately for our visitors, how-
ever, they and their coach,
Johnson, may have let these statistics
and others go to their heads. For it
was Washington and Lee that soon
established itself as the team to beat
in the conflict. It was W&L’s de-
fense that stormed back after last
week’s debacle and made the passing
game of Randy McKean and Bruce
Cook fall flat and the spectacular,
diving grasps of their excellent ends
somewhat less than meaningful. And
it was the great kicking of Rudd
Smith that throughout the afternoon

continually placed the Lynx offensive |

game in bad field position.

However this is not the reason

WAL won last Saturday. Rather, after | -

enduring weeks of practice and critic-
ism, the W&L offensive unit came
alive and obliterated the opposition.
Under the leadership and arm of
Andy Bloom, Washington and Lee
finally carried the game to the opposi-
tion in convincing fashion. Mixing his
plays very well, Bloom devastated
their secondary with passes up the
middle where they were usually di-
rected towards the most gifted re-
ceiver out on the field that day,
flanker Bucky Cunningham. But Andy
also used sweeps to both sides, quick-
Openers up the middle and power
plays to disect his beleaguered vic-
tims. Bill McDavid equaled his en-
tire scoring total of last year in
Saturday's game when he plunged
over the same, humiliated right tackle

Jesse |

of Southwestern for both of our third
period scores. Earlier, Big Luke had
squashed their left guard and tackle
on a second period scoring plunge
which had only been preceded minutes
before by a Bucky Cunningham pass
pattern that left himself and the
referee alone and happy in the middle
of the end zone. Also, just for kicks,
Cary Green connected for a 35-yard
field goal with 1:40 left in the first
half.

And so, W&L’s “homecoming
jinx” is extended to eight games, with
a 30-13 victory over the Lynx. But,
unless | am missing the mark, Satur-
day’s victory was not a meaningless
/extension of an unrelated sequence
of victorious affairs. This past week’s
display of skill and desire was no
fluke, no lucky victory by an aroused
but out-classed team. If anyone ever
doubted that the Generals possessed
the potential, their doubts should have
been dispelled. This game was clearly
the best game of the season for the
Generals and another hard-fought
contest next week will assure W&L
of at least a tie with Sewanee for the
CAC title.

For, while the offense moved the
ball and scored with it continually
and finally began to think touchdown
instead of field goal, last Saturday
was a team effort. No one could have
asked more from the team. Once
again, Scott Mackenzie, John Wolf,
John Harris, Charlie Freret et al, led
the defense up and over the Lynx
offensive line while blanketing their
receivers and intercepting their errant
| passes. And it was the gaping holes
long four years fo rmany of us. Now

At the state cross country meet
held last Friday at the University of
Richmond, the Washington and Lee
team came in seventh place. The time
of the top W&L runner, Corbet
Bryant, was 30:15, which placed him
33. Harry Zeliff was second fastest
with 30:57 and placed 41.

William and Mary completely
dominated the meet with its 1, 2, 3
finish. Although WA&L’s time was
better than at its last Richmond meet,
the competition with some of the
other schools was tough, and even
our best runners were clearly out-
classed.

‘Keep Off The Mats’

 

Football IM’s Near Finish

By GEORGE MacFARLAND

A sign over in the “Mus” gym

says “Keep Off The Mats.” This re-|

porter was greatly surprised to dis-
cover last Thursday that D.U., PiKA,
Phi Phi and Phi Kap_ were
systematically seeking to violate that
obvious direction.

Of the four only the Phi Kaps
failed in their insidious plots to violate
a university policy to keep people,
dogs, cats, etc. off the mats. No mat-
ter now hard they tried, everytime
they had a chance to get on the mat
a D.U. would get there first.

After it was all over it looks like
a big match between Pi Phi and Phi
Kap. It should be entertaining. If it
proves to be a mismatch as some
believe, then the spectator may turn
his attention to Coach Leslie and his
J.V. squad. He has some fine boys on
what promises to be a strong club.

W&L Soccer Wins
VISA’s Tournament

By LAURENCE M. HILLIARD

Despite a very serious lack of scor-
ing punch, the Generals’ soccer team
managed to squeeze by two lackluster
opponents this weekend to win the
Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer As-
sociation tourney at Smith Field. The
Generals, top-seeded in the four team
field, knocked out  fourth-seeded
V.M.1. 2-0 on Friday afternoon, then
came back to defeat second-seeded
Eastern Mennonite College, (a 5-4
victor over third-seeded University
of Virginia in the other semi-final) 2-1
on Saturday to capture the champ-
ionship. U.Va. grabbed third place
with a 3-0 conquest of V.M.1.

The tournament was hampered by
a very weak field. The four teams
entered were ranked 3rd (W&L), 4th
(E.MC.), 6th (UVa), and 9th
(V.M.1.). ‘Top-ranked Roanoke had a
date with Loyola of Baltimore for
the Mason-Dixon Conference Champ-
ionship, with an NCAA bid probably
going to the winner, and did not want
to risk a disabling injury. Second-
ranked Randolph-Macon declined for
the second year for reasons known
only to God and the R-MC athletic
department. Fifth-ranked Lynchburg
entered instead the Dixie Conference
tourney with an eye on an NAIA bid.
Seventh rated and defending VISA
champion VPI decided that they did
not have a chance for the tourney
with a 2-5 mark against state oppon-
ents, and called it a season after the
final game. V.M.I. was probably
chosen over eighth-ranked William
and Mary because if a team is going
to lose twice in a row (no one doubt-

ed that either V.M.I. or W&M would
do), it is better to come across town
instead of across the state.

Captains-Elect Star

Scott Fechnay and Thom Mitchell,
co-captains of next year’s team, led
the Generals to victory in the tourney.
Left-Inside Fechnay scored all four
goals for the Generals, three on pen-
alty kicks, and Goalie Mitchell stopped
all but one of nineteen shots taken
on him,

The Generals had an unexpectedly
tough time against V.M.I., a team
that lost every game this season.
Fechnay’s two penalty kicks, in the
second and fourth quarters, were the
only scoring of the game.

The Generals had an even tougher
time against E.M.C. The visitors
brought a large gallery of fans with
them (it surprised nobody that they
out-shouted the Generals’ Homecom-
ing “crowd”), and started out as if
they meant to pull an upset. Early
in the first quarter Left-Inside Kop-
perhaver converted a pass from
Right-Outside Swartz to give E.M.C.
a 1-0 lead. Fechnay knotted the score
in the second stanza by making good
on another penalty kick. He then won
the game with an unassisted goal at
12:15 of the third period. For his fine

grades on the mid-semester report
sheets.

Because Mid-semester grades are
to show the progress and the quality
of the work done by the student, the
student should have the opportunity
to show what he can do. However,
if it is necessary for a professor to
give an administrative grade, this
should be noted on the mid-semester
report as an administrative grade
rather than a grade based on work
attempted.

3) A test schedule similar to the
one recently adopted for final ex-
aminations should be set up rior
to the end of the mid-semester
period. Each class hour should have
one day on which a test could be
given. This would be arranged so
that the day of the last test would
be enough in advance so as to
| give the professor enough time to
grade them before the mid-semester
reports are due, Professors, of
course, may give tests prior to this
testing period or they do not have
to give one at all, Weekly tests

would not be affected by this
scheduling.
The Executive Committee feels

that the adoption of any or all of
the above proposals will make a more
equitable system for students and pro-
fessors alike and that it will clear up
many of the ambiguities about mid-
semester grades which exist under the
present system.
