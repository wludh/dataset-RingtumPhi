WEL Campus
For Christmas Festivities

Ihe Christmas season has already
started at W&L. The tree in the front
yard of the Lee House has been lit,
wreaths have been hung in the Com-
mons windows, and candles have been
put in the windows along the colon-
nade. Campus groups have also start-
ed their special yuletide events, most
of them continuing into this week.

The campus vocal and music groups
have gone all out for the Christmas
season again this year. The 55-voice
Washington and Lee Glee Club has
yet to present its annual Christmas
candlelight service with traditional
carols at 8 p.m., Thursday, Dec. 14,
at the Robert E. Lee Memorial Epis-
copal Church. The University Fed-
eration of Christian Concern will
participate in the service.

Foreign Language Concert

The 20th annual Foreign Language
Christmas Sing, one of Lexington’s
traditional but most unusual Yule
events, will be held Wednesday, Dec.
13, in Lee Chapel beginning at 5 p.m.
The program, during which Washing-
ton and Lee students sing a number
of holiday songs in various languages,
has proved in the past to be very
popular, especially with the children.

As in the past, the audience will

 

participate in the singing of several
of the songs. Programs outlining the
nature of the tunes and song sheets!
will be distributed at the door.

Both Christmas and secular songs
are included in the program. the
Christmas Story, as given in the

Gospel by Luke, will be read in Rus
sian, The final offering is traditionally

ending with the students and the
audience combining to sing the carol
in English.

Book Store Specials

In celebration of its first annivers-
ary, the University Book Store ts pres-
ently displaying a variety of books
suitable as Christmas gifts to young
and old.

The books range from current best-
sellers to reference works to books

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

A Thoughtful Wish

Scientists at the University of Michigan have shown that
even so lowly a species as the flatworm can eventually profit
by experience. Why, then, cannot the Inter-Fraternity Council?

It is now 13 months since the faculty first made its posi-
tion on rush clear. That position has been re-stated twice since,
in May and October, 1967, with the pro-immediate-rush voices
becoming quieter each time it comes before the faculty again.
And the IFC has failed absolutely to bring about a thing, even
to pay lip service to a faculty which is a) in a position of
direct superiority over it, for good or for bad, and b) obviously
not pleased. We suspect that the faculty vote could eventually
become unanimous—the progression has been in that direc-
tion—and still the Inter-Fraternity Council would eschew posi-
tive activity of even the most rudimentary sort.

The recent IFC-Faculty Coffee, which amounted to a
meeting of members of opposing factions with the Uni-
versity community, was a disaster of the first magnitude. Only
eight per cent of the University faculty bothered to show up—
bothered to give fraternities a further hearing on a subject the
faculty obviously feels is long settlked—bothered even to
acknowledge an ability and legitimacy on the IFC’s part to
discuss the matter. Great concern would not be an inappropriate
emotion with which fraternities might view that situation.

Whether the faculty is good or evil, whether the faculty
ought to be legislating in this field at all, whether the faculty
is acting as benevolent despots or malevolent tyrants—this
has not the remotest bearing on what the IFC must do. We
don’t like it, either; but it could be no more obvious that cir-
cumstances have brought fraternities to the point where they
exist purely at the pleasure of the faculty. And the faculty has
made its particular displeasure at the present state of things
eminently well known.

The minds of the faculty cannot be changed, not even if
every fraternity man in the South wants their minds to be
changed, on the fundamentals. This the faculty itself has said:
ask any faculty member who voted for deferred rush (most
will tell how they voted) whether anything conceivably could
make him change his mind. Fraternities can and are obliged to
modify and help shape deferred rush, within the boundaries
arbitrarily set by the faculty, but they cannot change it. And
they have to veer away from continuing the impertinent and
impotent practice of telling the faculty it is wrong or naive.

The IFC’s deferred rush committee—the entr’acte in the
present “drama”—has said its major problems are what to
do about contact between upperclassmen and freshmen until
rush can legally take place, and the structure within which the
actual rushing will take place. Although neither “major prob-
lem” specified by the committee bears any resemblance to the
actual “‘major problems’ that somebody—either the IFC or
the faculty—will have to contend with, there is nothing more
wrong with them than their being a waste of time.

The committee also plans to poll the deans of various
universities on rush, deferred and immediate, presumably in
an attempt to lend some authority to a similar poll taken among

other schools’ IFC presidents last year—a poll that was thrown |
out by the faculty as invalid. There are still, it is apparent, |
some people who just won't see the forest for the trees, who |
are happily oblivious to the most patently obvious of trends. |

What applicability could the situation at Richmond, or Carnegie
Tech, or even Amherst or Williams, have to Washington and
Lee—assuming the faculty would even consider another com-
parative study, which it has said it won't? Again, rightly
or wrongly, the faculty has carried the situation to the point of
no turning back. They themselves describe it as a situation
of “finality.”

What would the faculty say if the IFC decided not to
burden and irritate it with another meaningless, ineffectual
“rush in comparable schools” study. What would the faculty
say if the IFC directed its attentions, for a change, to con-
structing a reasonable, practicable, acceptable program, instead
of quixotically taking another poll that will lead absolutely
nowhere at all?

The faculty has indicated that almost anything that can in
good faith be called “deferred” will not be rejected. But
beyond that boundary the faculty will not go. Even the most
sweeping revision of pledging rules in anybody's memory was
termed “commendable” but “unacceptable” as a response
to the demand for deferred rush. The faculty has further indi-
cated that it will accept nothing less than one full semester's
delay; and if the IFC neglects to set up a body of regulations
covering rush under those conditions, the faculty has indicated
it would rather allow, at least during the first year, unchecked
chaos than bother itself with formulating a plan for fraternities
to follow. Perhaps fraternities want this; perhaps they want to
show what will happen unless the faculty compromises with
it (and wanting the faculty to compromise is not itself wrong).
But if this is the case, the IPC’s handling of the matter from
ad public -relations point of view is abominable.

Please, though: no more polls, no more revanchism, no
more anti-pragmatism. The faculty long ago cornered the
power market, and the students are left less and less room

Morton Says Republicans Can Win

On Policies Of Pos

(Senator Thruston Morton, R-Ky., who will speak at the Inter-Fra-
ternity Council's 1967 “Contact” program, was interviewed over the tele-
phone by Tuesday Ring-tum Phi writer Larry Honig. Following is a
transcript of that interview, made possible by the studio facilities of
WLUR-FM and through the courtesy of Charles Winston, station man-

I don't think the Republicans are going to be asleep at the switch, put it
that way.

Copyright © 1967 by The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Ring-tum Phi; Senator Morton, does the election of Republican Louis B.
Nunn as governor of Kentucky indicate a significant trend toward Republic-

anism in your state?

Senator Morton: You'll have to bear in mind that .

of such interviews with prominent

won, and he won by a comfortable majority, but we lost the other Consti-
tutional offices except for two or three minor ones. In the city of Louisville,
where we have a Republican mayor, and we had a Republican city council
(we call it the Board of Aldermen), we lost 11 out of 12 on the Board of
Aldermen.

So I don't think one can take it as significant. I'm very happy that
Judge Nunn was elected, of course—the first Republican in 25 years. But
I'm not going to accept as being something that means, for instance, that
I'm a shoo-in in 1968, I'm going to work my head off.

R-t Phi: In the recent election, a candidate from former Alabama Governor
George Wallace's American Independent Party ran very unsuccessfully in
Kentucky. Would you say this contradicts Governor Nunn’s victory in that

Morten: No, | do not. | have known Gene McCarthy ever since he came
to the House of Representatives. We served together there for I think it
was four years, and now I've served with him in the Senate for some ten
or twelve years,

And he is a sincere person; | may not agree with him on many issues—
we're both members of the Finance Committee, and we've had many dis-
agreements—but I don’t question his sincerity and I don’t think he’s anybody’s
stalking-horse.

R-t Phi: What do you think of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller’s
statement last week indicating that he might accept a genuine draft for
the Republican nomination?
Morton; | think this would come
about if we find ourselves in
Miami Beach in a deadlock, or at
least with no candidate there who
can win it on the first one or
two ballots. I think Governor
Rockefeller might well put him-
self into the race and go after it.
But short of that, | don’t think

'

 

conservatism may not any longer be a synonym for Republicanism?

Morton: No, no. This fellow ran merely to get two percent of the vote, which
is required to get on the ballot, and he failed miserably in this. 1 don’t
think this a question of a judgment of conservatism at all... {Judge Nunn]
is, | would class him, a conservative, but he certainly is a positive con-

servative.

I think one can be conservative without being negative; and I think this
is one of the problems that Republicans face, that our conservatism has
been associated with negativism. Now,
positive programs, but within a conservative framework. And I think this

is what showed up in our election.

R-t Phi: Do you think the people of the United States are afraid of con-
Servatism, as a carryover from Senator Goldwater's candidacy?

Morton: | think if conservatism is put in a negative attitude, that it would
be rejected by the majority of voting citizens in the United States, On the
other hand, I think we've shown by picking up twenty-six gubernatorial seats—
58 percent of the population are now under Republican governors—that
you can have what I call a positive conservatism. | think you can move
this country forward within the tenets and within the mores and within the
framework of its traditions which have been, in the main, conservative.

R-t Phi: Do you expect Republicans to capitalize on the split in the
Democratic Party evidenced by the candidacy of Senator Eugene McCarthy?
Morton: It’s hard to say just what'll happen, but I know perfectly well that
Republicans will capitalize on it. | mean, I think that any split in the
Democratic party, of course, would work to the benefit of Republicans... .

former statements, that he’s not a
candidate, that he’s supporting
Governor Romney, at face value,
Do you see an apparent front-runner at this time?

 

R-t Phi:
Morton: I'd say at this time, if you're speaking of the nomination, now, . , .

one has to say that Dick Nixon is ahead.

R-t Phi: Whom do you favor for the Republican presidential nomination?
Morton: | favor anybody that can get elected. I can be comfortable with any-
body that’s been mentioned, and I'm going to watch the first two or three
primaries. I'll probably be for somebody when we get to Miami Beach,
but at this point I haven't made a choice,

I have the highest regard for all those that have been mentioned. I'm
not trying to be coy about this, but I want just not only to see someone
nominated, | want to see somebody elected in November.

R-t Phi: Is there any candidate you especially would not like to see obtain
the nomination?

Morton: No, | have no quarrel with any of those who have been mentioned,
rhe only one | can think of that | wouldn't want to see get nominated is a
guy from Kentucky named Morton,

R-t Phi: You have been labeled a “dove” in the Republican Party. What is
your position on Vietnam?

Morton: | don’t like these absolute terms of “hawk” and “dove.” I do dis-
agree with our present policies in Vietnam; now this doesn’t mean that I
want to send an armada over there and pull out our troops.

I think this hunt and destroy business that we're engaged in in the north-
ern part of South Vietnam is costing us an awful lot in blood and treasure.
And 1 can't see that it’s producing anything -very few people live there.
I'd like to see us try to secure the twenty percent of the area in which
eighty perecent of the people live.

Every time I read that we take Hill 885 upper in the northern
part and lose, let’s say, 26 casualties, and the next week we have to take
it back again and then the next edition of the paper says that within 20
miles of Saigon 14 people were killed—this to me is a little bit unrealistic.

And I think we could certainly change our tactics there. which would
cut our casualties immeasurably and probably in the end lead to a solution
to this dilemma.

This week’s Player of the
Week was again a difficult
choice with outstanding per-
formances being turned in by
Rob Bauer (last week’s win-

Mike Neer. However, in view
of his performance in the
Randolph-Macon Invitational
Tournament, this week’s choice

is Mike Neer.

This past weekend Coach Canfield
added one more trophy to his collect-
ion as the Generals took third place
in the Randolph-Macon Invitational
Tournament in Ashland. Macon took
first place, Lycoming second, and
Maryville fourth.

Friday night in the opening game
of the Tournament the Generals lost
to Lycoming by a score of 78-70,
The Generals had as much as a nine-
point lead in the first half but the
half ended in a deadlock at 37-37.
The second half saw Lycoming domi-
nate scoring and go on to spread
the gap that the Generals never man-
aged to close.

The Generals problem in Friday's
contest was that they had no offensive
movement and committed 20  turn-
overs which were converted into 22
points by Lycoming. The Generals
did managed to out rebound Lycom-
ing (45-37) and out shoot them (49%

 

 

the W&L swimmers performed especi-
ally well including freshman standout
Bill Brumback who broke a school
and pool record in the 500 yard free-
style. Brumback’s winning time in this
even was 5:25.5, while the previous
pool record was 5:33.0.

while Reeve Kelsey came in third. In
the 500 yard freestyle, which Brum-
back won in record time, W&L’s Scott
McElroy finished second. In the 200
yard breaststroke, freshman Mike
Berry captured a first with a winning

time of 2:25.9 seconds; co-captain Pat
Costello swam unofficially in this
event.

The Gettysburg team captured the
400 yard freestyle relay defeating
WA&L's official entry of Joe Philips,
John Ackerman, Harry Hill, and Paul
Sugar, while in the next lane an ex-
hibition team of Ball, Catlin, Kymp-
ton, and Forman finished off this

from the floor and 63% from the
| line). Another highlight for the Gen-
| erals was the fine job done by Mike
Neer as he poured in 22 points and
' dominated the boards. Wesselink also
/had a hot hand, scoring 16 points.
| Mel Cartwright was double teamed
most of the night and only got 8.

Saturday night’s game was a dif-
ferent story as the Big Blue had three
men with 20 or more points and
masacred Maryville 102-62. The Gen-
erals ran with the ball but also man-
aged to play a good defensive game.
They out rebounded Maryville 55-37
and shot a fantastic 62% from the
floor. Also their foul shooting looked
considerably better at 74%.

Mike Neer led the Generals’ scor-
ing with 29, Cartwright followed with
25, then Bauer with 20. Coach Can-
field had the following to say about
the work of his outside men: “John
