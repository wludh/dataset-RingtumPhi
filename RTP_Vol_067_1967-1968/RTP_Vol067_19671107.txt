Sen. Philip Hart
Plans To Speak
On Trust Policy

Ihe School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration and the School of Law
will present U. S. Senator Philip A.
Hart at 8 p.m., Wednesday, Novem-
ber 15, in Lee Chapel. Sen Hart will
speak on “Anti-Trust Laws.”

Sen. Hart was born in Bryn Mawr,
Pa., and received an A.B. from
Georgetown University and a J.D.
from the University of Michigan.

After graduation and admittance to
the Michigan Bar, Sen. Hart practiced
law in Detroit. In 1941 he joined the
army as a second lieutenant. As a
lieutenant colonel in the D-Day in-
vasion, he was wounded at Utah
Beach. In 1945 he received the Croix
de guerre.

After his discharge from the army,
he returned to practice law in De-
troit. He later served as U. S. attorney
for the Eastern District of Michigan
and as legal adviser to the governor
of Michigan.

From 1955 until his election to
the U. S. Senate in 1958, Hart was
the lieutenant-governor of Michigan.
As Michigan's first lieutenant-gover-
nor to serve in the office full time,
Hart capably outlined the state's pro-
gram for distributing the polio vac
cine.

Since his election to the Senate as
a Democrat, Hart has served on the
committees of agriculture, forestry,
and the judiciary. He is also chairman
of the Senate sub-committee on Anti-
Trust and Monopoly.

Senator Hart is a past Michigan
chairman of the American Christian
Palestine Committee. He has also
been president of the Michigan State
Bar Foundation, and currently, he is
a member of the Detroit Committee
on Foreign Relations.

In 1952 Hart received the award
of the Federal Business Association
as the Outstanding Federal Admini
strator for the year, in recognition of

Faculty Approves Exam Change;
Drug Use Subjected To Penalties

In actions yesterday afternoon, the
faculty made changes and clarifica-
tions in regulations concerning exams,
automobile regulations, and student
drug use.

The Faculty approved the follow-
ing resolution that had been submitted
by the Student Affairs Committee con-
cerning drug use:

“Because of recent events oc-
curring on college campuses, the
Student Affairs Committee has given
special attention to the problem of
misuse of drugs by stndents.

“The Committee recognizes that
there are customary procedures at
Washington and Lee for the handl-
ing of matters involving student dis-
cipline on a case-by-case basis with
no schedule of penalties presribed
in advance. The Committee feels
that this established approach to
student discipline has proven effect-
ive and should be preserved. How-
ever, the Committee would like to
make known its view that the mis-
use of drugs by students would be
a serious disciplinary offense, and
that in all such cases the penalty
of suspension or expulsion from

cerning changes in the examination

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

AT MID-TERM

This is only the seventh Tuesday Ring-tum Phi of the
year, and yet so much has taken place at Washington and Lee
that we'd like to recap some highlights of the two months so
far—in concentrated form, both for impact and because if
we waited much longer a reasonably comprehensive listing
would be burdensomely overlong—and because in the last
analysis, we’re rather fond and proud of this University.
® Most striking is the frequency and top-notch quality of the
diverse speakers who have visited here. Walter Heller and
Senator Hart, both brought under the Commerce School’s
new alumni-funded speaker series; Secretary of Transporta-
tion Boyd, who dropped in one Saturday; Sir Sidney Caine;
Drs. Fletcher, Kernodle, Williams and Lehman; Anthony
Howard of the London “Observer”—these all came to Wash-
ington and Lee because we are Washington and Lee, not
because we are stops on a lecture tour. The lecture-tour speakers
oughtn’t be neglected, either; this year’s speakers, including
Undersecretary of State Frankel and Drs. Freidel and Kazin,
are among the most noteworthy we've had on campus in a
long time. “Contact,” bringing Barry Goldwater and Thruston
Morton, with others yet to be announced, and the Mock Con-
vention, bringing Claude Kirk and others also yet to be
announced—these all give us a good start, to say the least.
® The new student union, conceived and begun-upon under
Dr. Cole’s administration, will undeniably do W&L a world of
good. The Troub Theatre renovations, the new and sorely
needed ROTC facility, the imminence of announcement of
a major development program—the University’s physical
well-being is being well looked after.
® Enough huzzahs can never be given the faculty for amend-
ing the exam schedule. A thousand other things deserve men-
tion, too: WLUR’s decision to broadcast football games (and
its superb execution of that decision); Mrs. Munger and the
Bookstore; the provocative, fruitful alumni visitation; the
Glee Club in Montreal; the new curriculum committees; the
new attitude toward hazing (certainly attributable only in part
to the new rules); for that matter, the marvelous interest
shown by everybody for everything that makes W&L what it
is, and in everything that ought to make it what it ought to be.

Most places would give their eye teeth to have that for
a year-long record. We have that, and more, in a half-term.
Add it to the faculty and student body we also have, and we
seem to come precious close to fulfilling, already this year,
the outline of W&L’s “basic purposes” in the Self-Study’s
“Statement of Institutional Philosophy”: “The dedication of
all our resources to the development of the capacity and de-
sire to learn, to understand and to pass on to others.” Amen.

irk Says Johnson Will Dump Humpbrey

(Florida Governor Claude Kirk, who will keynote
the 1968 Mock Republican Convention, was inter-
viewed over the telephone by Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
writer Larry Honig. Following is a transcript of that
interview.)
Copyright © 1967 by The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
7 + -
Ring-tum Phi: Mr. Governor, do you believe Senator
Smathers is going to retire next year?
Gov. Kirk: We've been given every assurance by the
Senator in his constant statements that he is going to
retire. | only had one misgiving, and that was when
he made the statement a few months ago that he felt
like his health might return to him in time to run for
the governorship in 1970. It sounds to me like if he's
going to feel that good in 1970, he might feel a little
bit better in 1968,

R-t Phi: Whom do you see from both parties as possible
contenders for the seat?

Kirk: The Democratic party has got its two so-far regist
ered contenders, Mr. Leroy Collins, former governor of
the State, and the present attorney-general of the State,
Mr. Faircloth. There is some continued rumor that the
chairman of the Board of Regents [Chester Ferguson],

who is not supposed to be a political dean, is the
maior candidate for Senator,
The Republican party has the very attractive

Congressman, [Edward J.| Gurney from Orange County,
which is Orlando, [who] will probably announce some
day soon that he will be a candidate and will then make
the race and will be elected the | nited States Senator
from Florida

R-t Phi: What prospects do you see for expansion of the
Republican party in the South?
Kirk: We're not concerned about the South. Were
Florida, which happens to be geographically located in
the South. I'm from Alabama, and quite frankly we like
to think that we're members of the United States. As the
Republican party expands in the nation, i also will be
expanding in the various slates which are also located
in the South

Somehow or other, | hear people say South” with

tongue-in-cheek like we're some retarded group
1 object to that ind I point oul thal Florida, of Qours
. the eighth state in the nation, and well in vivance of
ome of the other geographically located states that are

in other positions all the way down to number filty

R-+ Phi: Do you see any possiblity of the Republican
party recapturing the Negro bloc vote?
Kirk: | would hate to think there was such a thing a»
say kind of bloc vote. In Florida, we dont have while
people or Negroes—we have six million Floridians, And
| think we don't appeal to blocs down here. Now, may be
that’s the order of the day in Northern districts Mayor
Daley's area. where the President seems to think its 80
important that he has the Convention
Inasmuch as the Republican party wanted to be
n Miami, and so voted apparently the President
subscribes to your approach that there are such things
bloc votes. Therefore he put it in Chicago We dont
ubseribe to that in Florida, or in the Republican part)
We think Americans are Ameficans

-+ Phi: People have cautioned the Republican party

that if it nominates a candidate with a stronger position

on Vietnam than Johnson's, the Communists will take
action to ensure Johnson's re-election. In light of Khru-
shchev’s bragging about Nixon's defeat, what do you
think of this caution?

Kirk: I don’t know who these people are. | think that's
some wishful thinking on the part of some very ultra-
liberal writer . . . who can't think of anything else to
say or do. Unless you can establish the person, time and
place. I doubt if anybody that wants to vouch for his
name ever said that... . You know the easiest thing to
float and the hardest thing to sink is a rumor.

R-t Phi: Senator Tower of Texas and you are recognized

 

“Mir. Politics is not going to sit around... ~

po sible Vice-Presidential candidates from the South
Do you see any others’
Kirk: I'm not a Vice-Presmlential candidate from the
South. I'm damn tired of being identified as that jist
because [Tm a Southerner. We Southernet ive a little

 

 

upset with this continued segregation; were nol second
class citizens down here

And if vow think & man capable of being Vice
President—one breath from being President——then you
must think he’s capable of being President. We all know
that there is NO Way a nm can campaign for Vice- Presi
dent The President picks his Vice-Presidential
candidate. So | think that’s jet so much sepregation
hat we will le hem be gun bearers bul we wont ever

let them be hunters. Quite frankly, | don't subscribe to
that.

I'm not a candidate for either office, but if you're
going to talk about it, let's . . . be candidates on equality
with people from other areas. As an example, how many
people are in Michigan? There are 8'o million.
Why is the governor of Michigan any better than the
Senator from Texas? | have six million people here.

lo pick another extreme, Mr. Goldwater was Senator
from a State that has a million people. I don’t think the
size or location of states has . . . anything to do with it,
Now you must admit, of course, that the governor of
the State of New York or the governor of the State of
California—the number one state in the nation, by
number—is automatically catapaulted into . . . presi-
dential consideration.

You may remember all the time that Governor
Warren was governor, he was always mentioned. Pat
Brown was always mentioned for some position, Those
are realistic; that’s all right

R-t Phi: A supposed handicap of a Rockefeller-Kirk oF
Rockefeller-Reagan ticket is that all have been divorced
Do you feel this is or could become a handicap?
Kirk: | don't think that's any handicap. .. . We're talk
ing about electing a man on his ability to administer a
state or a nation, and not his ability to live with a
woman On that basis, you'd never elect a bachelor,
either My 18 years of marriage—I don't know about
the others—resulted in four lovely children. I'll stake
my four children against the President's two any day
you want to, on quality of person, or bearing, or beauty
you name it

So Till stake any one of my marriages against any
body else's, if that's the criterion, Quite frankly, | think
Americans are over that if all the Americans and
their families who've been touched by divorce were to
all get behind the divorced candidate,
ably have a sweeping victory for him

{Americans are] over the fact that you cant vote
for a Jew because he's a Jew, you cant vole for a

you'd prob

Catholic because he's a Catholic, you cant vote for a
Negro because he's a Negro, you cant vole for a
divorced man because he's divorced, They look at the
man as a man and not anything other than what job

hes supposed lo do

R-¢t Phi: When and why do you think the American pub
lic came over this?
Kirk: Because we're Americans. This is the most dynamic
country in the world, This is a country where theres a
consianit revolution: democracy is a constant revolution
We are the only country in the world that is in constant
revolution, trying to upgrade every person within our
boundaries

Obviously, by our record, we're trying to upgrade and
help up every willing person in the world, We've done

im Japan, we've done it in Germany, were trying to
do it in Vietnam, we've done it in Korea, were willing
to do it in Africa, we're trying our best to do it in South
America

R-t Phi: In your opinion, who is the front-runner for the
Republican Presidential nomination?

Kirk: | don't know who that would be now. There are
o many fine candidates that truly the Republican Con
ention will he the only democratic convention conducted

tis Vea!

R-t Phi: Whom do you favor, may we ask, for the Presi-
dential nomination?

Kirk: | just think any one of them is going to make a
great President. Fortunately, any one of the Republican
candidates . . . would make far and away a greater
President than the existing President of the United States.
So we can't help but win, if we go to work.

Now I think, as I've stated last week, that we have
an uphill fight, because Mr. Politics—which is President
Johnson—is not going to sit around and just not do
something after that very exciting Republican convention.
.. . He’s got to do something, and. . . he probably will
ask Mr. Humphrey to step aside and become Secretary
of State or Secretary of Defense, and will seemingly open
up the convention to some measure of excitement.

But actually | think what he will do is try to get the
doves back in the Democratic coop by naming a military
dove as Vice-Presidential candidate with him, which
would of course be General James Gavin. | made this
statement in Detroit, and I think a lot of people agree
with me

I mean, who's the past master of grabbing the head-
lines? Who's the boy that throws the long ball in the
eleventh hour? Who is the very suckling child of politics?
It's Mr. Politics, the President of the United States, You
can fault him in anything you want to fault him in,
but you can't fault him as Mr. Politics

 

Last summer the militant SNCC chairman H, Rap Brown
came to Jacksonville and ay he urged his audience to
“get yourself some gums,” Gov. Kirk overwhelmed him
with a cheerful “Welcome to Florida!” Brown was so
aghast and the audience so enthralled that the situation
quickly calmed down, Kirk left after an energetic round
of handshaking and Brown left muttering something
about rude Southern “honkles.”

Blue Dumped By Tigers:
Bloom’s Passing Totals 224

Last Saturday, in a game which, back Bubba Owens and by Jim Beene

could have clinched the CAC title for
Washington and Lee, the University
of the South at Sewanee rolled over
the Generals 43-0.

The usually strong Blue defense was
unable to contain the overwhelming
rushing attack of Sewanee led by half-

(last year’s all CAC defensive back).

Scoring for the Purple Tigers started
early in the first quarter when back,
Charles Gignilliat ended a strong
rushing attack with a two yard scamp-
er into paydirt.

The second quarter was almost com-
pletely dominated by the Tiger offense.
fouchdowns were scored by King on
a 29 yard pass play, Owens on a 58
yard run, and finally by Blount on
a two yard run.

The Generals tried hard to over-
come their 28 point deficit in the
second half but failed to move the
ball consecutively. Sewanee added
another 6 points to their score but
Underwood failed to gain the extra
point.

Once again, in the fourth quarter,
the Generals could only muster a
mediocre offensive drive and allowed
Beene to sneak through on a one yard

run. In the closing minutes of the
game, Poff blocked a W&L punt and
a safety was scored.

Sewanee, with 334 yards rushing,
outgained the Generals 478 to 288 in
total offense. Probably the most out-
standing performance by the blue
team was Andy Bloom. Completing
19 out of 33 passes he totaled 244
yards.

The loss was the Generals’ third
this year against four victories. Sewa-
nee is also 4-3.

It is interesting to note that for
the last five years of Homecoming
games with Sewanee, W&L has lost
only before the Sewanee homecoming
crowd, and Sewanee has lost only be-
fore the Generals’ home crowd.

I-M Football

Nears Climax

By GEORGE McFARLAND

This week I-M football will move
to a climatic finish with playoffs be-
ginning next week. In league “A” it
seems to be all over. Phi Gam is the
surprise class of this league. The Phi
Kaps seem to have lost “the knack”
this year. If you do not believe Phi
Gam is all that great, just ask a
Siema Nu.

“B” league will witness a collison
of the behemoths Wednesday at 2
p.m. The Phi Delts will clash with
Lambda Chi for the league trophy,
which should be a lovely piece of
hardware.

“C” league has been busily seek-
ing to defeat the Phi Psi varsity team
to no avail. Kappa Sig will be seeking
to put a cramp in the Phi Psi bid for
glory, but it looks like a tough
assignment.

“D” league has to be the surprise
of the season with N.F.U. perched
on top of an embarrassed heap. They
played ZBT today. A ZBT win would
develop a three way tie between
N.F.U,, S.P.B. and Z.B.T.

Who knows the story on minor
sports? As long as the fraternities
sink all their atheletic funds in foot-
ball scholarships there will be little
University interest in the “lesser”
sports, Remember now, cut your labs
next week and hike over to the
practice field for the orgiastic climax
of 1-M football, It should be worth the
effort. Meanwhile, this reporter will

 

i be seeking information leading to a

By RIC BERARD

With all the recent excitement about
our football team and the great prom-
ise of other in-
tercollegiate sports
here on campus, it
has suddenly _ be-
come apparent to
me that all of us
have been ignor-
ing or else unaware
of the emergence
of a new giant
within the W&L
community. Natur-
ally, 1 am referring
to the FU intra-

BERARD

mural program.

For following a perusal of current
I-M standings, the old fraternity bones
in me had a convulsive start when I
spied the FU record of 9-8. With a
certain masochistic design, | pursued
this unfortunate turn of events to the
local I-M fields where I witnessed
another FU gridiron triumph over the
“beep-beep” fraternity.

No longer able to control my nose
for news, I shuffled up to a departing
victor and ever so casually queried
my man. As I recall, it went some-
thing like this:

“Well, ya'll really must have had
another lucky day, today, huh?”

“What do you mean ‘lucky,’ buddy?

Those bums were ‘lucky’ to escape
with their lives. We should have
scored twice as many points!”

“Gee, but I thought the ‘beep-
beeps’ had a good team this year?”

“Well, maybe. They did try hard.
And they were the best the fraterni-
ties have been able to throw against
us so far. But still, it was a slaughter.”

“But isn’t it true that this is the
first year that the FUs, oops—sorry—
I mean Independents, have been able
to win even one football game?”

“Yeah, but we're changing with the
school. You know, the better the
school gets, the stronger we will be-
come. It’s just great. Whether for
participation points or a winning
game, fellas are cutting labs, seminars
and ROTC just to be a part of this
change. Oh, by the way, you can
call us FUs. It’s a source of pride
now.”

“You realize that not many fra-
ternity men would agree with you?”

“That's okay. We know we're righi
and we have time on our side. Be-
sides, we've got more people to draw
on than any fraternity on campus.
Right now, all we have to do is
marshal all our forces and we can
be right at the top of this I-M heap
come next June, After all, we came
in ninth last year. And, in terms of
this season our best sports are just
coming up.”

“Hmmm. Surely, you must have
some weaknesses? | mean, you can't
destrory the fraternities’ leadership in
one year, can you?”

“You're right, we do have a weak-
ness: we can't get freshmen FUs to
participate. We have a real communi-
cation problem; there's no doubt about
it. But we're going to have some meet-
ing this week in order to get things
moving. Until now, we have had only
a couple of freshmen helping, but one
of them scored in the top ten in the
turkey trot. Still, you're right, we
do have that one weakness. Otherwise,
watch out!”

“Gee, a lot of fraternities need the
I-M rankings for rush week; it all
seems kind of vengeful and unfair,
Are you sure this is what you want
to do?”

Then, in a fit of laughter, my inter-
viewee grabbed a basketball and went
upstairs to the FU scrimmage.

Exactly what will become of this
new spirit, talent and participation by
the motley aggregate known as the
“PUs” is unclear, However, through
the efforts of last year's athletic di-
rector, Neil Jespersen, and the current
organizer, Ray Bradford, many tal-
ented non-fraternity men are now not
only having fun in I-M, but also win-
ning games, It really presents a de-

lightful problem of great magnitude |

for the motely establishment.

The College Athletic Conference
held its fourth annual cross country
meet on Saturday, and for the fourth
time, Washington University has run
away with first place honors.

Running over Washington and Lee’s
4.1 mile course, the Battling Bears
from St. Louis completely dominated
the race, taking first, second, third,
fifth, seventh, eighth, and ninth. Since
only the first five runners from each
team count in the scoring, W.U., had
a score of 18, only three more than
the possible minimum, The host Gen-
erals were second with 57, followed
by Southwestern, 91, Centre, 99, and
Sewanee, 113.

For the second year in a row, Dave
Romano of Washington was the indi-
vidual champion, covering the course
in a time of 23:45.3. He was followed
by teammates Ben Slavich, and Ron
Stewart. Hopes for the other four
teams are pretty bleak, as Washington
will have all seven of its top runners
back next year.

Harry Zeliff in fourth place was the

power to charge interest to anyone
who was delinquent in paying them.

Kline, Vellines, Halford, Crenshaw,
Leonard, Tompkins, and Hendricks
voted for the change. Faulk, Mat-
thews, and Sandler voted against the
motion. Several of those who voted
against the motion apparently felt that
the additional work that the Cold
Check Committee would be required
to do would not be of any significant
value.

Crenshaw moved to have 3 addi-
tional upperclassmen appointed to the
Curriculum Committee at the request
of Lane Steinger. This motion passed
6-5 with Nash casting the tie-breaking
vote. For the motion were Nash,
Faulk, Matthews, Halford, Crenshaw,
and Leonard. Against the motion were
Kline, Vellines, Sandler, Tompkins,
and Hendicks. Butch West was absent.
Many of those that voted against the
motion felt that at least one of the
three should be from the freshman
class.

Lane Steinger outlined the initial

action of his committee. It has been
divided into two sub-committees. The
first sub-committee is to determine the
type and scope of the course review;
the second is to concern itself with
the changes in the curriculum.

The Curriculum Committee would
attempt to face the following questions
over the year, Steinger stated: the
status of the independent major, crea-
tion of more inter-departmental ma-
jors, the status and prerequisites of
seminars, a tutorial plan, general
theses and comprehensives, possible
changes in the graduation require-

ments, and a survey of the free col-
lege system. The free college system
is where students will get together
and run a course or seminar for
themselves on their own.

Herb Crenshaw then reported on
his study on the problem of the
tests at mid-semester. The EC reach-
ed a consensus that they had a three
point program which they could act
on, First, letters should be sent to
all parents explaining the exact scope
and meaning of the mid-semester re-
ports. Second, scheduling of mid-
semester tests On a system similar to
that of the new final exam system.
This would prevent more than one
mid-term exam on any one day.
Third, the use of a pass or fail
criterion instead of an administrative
grade.

The EC postponed action on the
mid-semester proposals until all the
members had time to think over
Crenshaw's report,

Turner Writes On Railroad

Dr. Charles W. Turner, professor
of history, has written an article ap-
pearing in the current (October) num-
ber of “The Railway and Locomotive
Historical Society Bulletin,” published
by the Baker Library of Harvard Uni-
versity’s business school.

Dr. Turner’s article is entitled “The
‘Great Short Line’ In Reconstruction,
1865-1876," and concerns the Rich-
mond, Fredericksburg and Potomac
Railroad, which has “the distinction
of being one of the earliest to be
chartered and built in the United
States with capital subscribed by both
the state and private interests.”

New Circuit Court Judge
Schedules A Speech
For Law School

The Student Bar Association will
present United States Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals Judge John D.
Butzner, Jr. Tuesday, November 14,
at 8:00 p.m. in Tucker Hall.

Judge Butzner, a native of Scran-
ton, Pa., received his B.A. from the
University of Scranton and his LL.B.
from the University of Virginia.

Appointments

After he was admitted to the Vir-
ginia Bar in 1941, Butzner set up a
private legal practice in Fredericks-
burg. He remained in Fredericksburg
until 1958. From 1958 to 1962 he
served a judge in the 15th and 39th
Judicial Circuits of Virginia.

In 1962 Butzner was appointed to
the federal judiciary as U. S. Judge
in Richmond for the Eastern District
of Virginia. Butzner served in that
capacity until last August, when he
was appointed to the 4th Circuit
Court of Appeals in Richmond.

 

UFOCC Initiates Drive
For Clothing from Campus

The University Federation of Chris-
tian Concern, in collaboration with
the Circle K, will start its clothing
drive tomorrow. The clothes are be-
ing collected for the needy of Lex-
ington and Rockbridge County.

Boxes will be placed in convenient
locations around campus and in the
fraternity houses, The campus loca-
meet on Saturday, and for the fourth
dormitories and in Tucker Hall.

The distributor for the majority of
the clothing collected will be the
Rockbridge County Welfare Depart-
ment. The superintendant, Mrs. Wil-
liam Buchanan, wife of the political
science professor, expressed great en-
thusiasm for the drive. All clothing
that can be collected would find use
right here in Rockbridge County.

Contributions by college students
would be especially valuable since
men’s clothing is always hard for wel-
fare groups to acquire. “Pajamas and
sweaters would be especially useful,”
said Mrs. Buchanan.

However, Mrs. Buchanan was quick
to point out that only clothing which
was reasonably clean and wearable
would be of any help. “Torn rags
cannot keep anyone warm.”

 

Faculty Changes Exam Schedule

Professor Writes Article

The inner recessed area of the pub-
lic stage in Renaissance Spain is the
subject of an article by Professor
L. L. Barrett published recently in
“Renaissance Drama 1967.”

While there is some doubt that the
English Renaissance stage had such
a recessed area, there is evidence of
its existence in Spanish stages at the
time, Dr. Barrett notes. His article,

which grew out of discussion of a
paper he presented two years ago in
Chicago at a Conference on Research
Opportunities in Renaissance Drama,
examines this evidence.
