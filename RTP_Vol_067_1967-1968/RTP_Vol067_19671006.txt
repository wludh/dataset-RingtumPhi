If Clinard is successful, he will live
in one of the residential colleges at
Oxford, where he will “read” (the
equivalent of our major) English
Language and Literature.

Clinard is on the Honor Roll, is

@ Alumni Discuss Ways
ToImprove Relations

Representatives of alumni chapters
from all over the country yesterday
heard administrative leaders call for
“better communications” between the
university and alumni.

Approximately 60 alumni and their
wives attended the meeting yesterday
afternoon in Lee Chapel, at the be-
ginning of a three-day series of meet-
ings with administrators, faculty, and
students. The alumni represent 35 of
WAL’s 45 organized alumni chapters.

“Washington and Lee—An Over-
view” was the subject of the intro-
ductory session, presented by a panel
consisting of Acting President Wil-

He also warned, however, that “Wash-
ington and Lee has needs—terribly
expensive needs.”

Concluding the discussion, Mr. Par-
sons presented the delegates with some
of the plans and goals of the newly-
formed Development Committe, while
admitting “we are in a difficult year”

Our Congratulations

It’s not too often that we get the chance to be unreservedly
complimentary about something. In the first place, any such

enthusiasm about any aspect of

W&L usually raises a host of

cynical eyebrows. In the second place, the standard editorial
cliches (“we view with alarm” or “we note with dismay”) are
ill-suited to congratulations. However, two unconnected events
this week make it well worth braving both eyebrows and cliches
to extend a little praise to where it’s due.

ok

The special conference for alumni chapter representatives
is the most heartening thing we’ve seen in a long, long time.

When big-time football left the W&L campus, so did a
lot of the alumni spirit, and we’ve been a long time in finding
out ways to win it back. Last year a limited program of alumni-
faculty and alumni-student interchange was conducted for the

benefit of 11 of the university’s
gram was so successful that it has

12 alumni directors. The pro-
been expanded to a full three-

day event with some 60 alumni present, representing 35 of 45
alumni chapters all over the country.

To judge from yesterday’s opening session in Lee Chapel,
the enlarged program is enjoying all the success it deserves. The
administration officials who made up the panel were on the
whole remarkably frank in reminding the alumni of their
responsibilities to Washington and Lee, both financiallly and
otherwise. Mr. Parsons did not hesitate to score the “token
responses” which soothe the alumni’s conscience and do
nothing to solve W&L’s problems. Mr. Whitehead did not
conceal the fact that the university’s present solid financial
situation is not necessarily a guarantee of good health in the
future. The general outlines of W&L’s future development
were spelled out from expansion of physical facilities to the

selection of the new president.
situations with administration,

Further meetings in informal
faculty, and students should

present the alumni with an even broader picture of what’s
going on at W&L—something which many of them have been

missing for all too long.
For their part, the alumni
which, if it can be maintained,

yesterday showed an interest
may actually lead someday to

a revived sense of involvement among the alumni as a whole.
As one impressed gentleman said after yesterday’s meeting:
“Keep this coming!” The questions afterwards covered fed-
eral aid, alumni participation at other universities, the size of
the endowment—and a request for annual, detailed reports
from the university to the alumni.

The organizers of the events and the alumni who have at-
tended it, deserve our most sincere congratulations,

Kudos also go to the EC this week, fo rtaking on the task

of cleaning out the Augean

Schedule.

stables of our Examination

The weaknesses of the exam schedule as it now exists
are so patently obvious that only those who have never taken
examinations under it can still argue for its fairness. The
schedule is an utterly arbitrary machine. Certain compromises
have been made in the direction of easing the load on fresh-

men; everyone else suffers.

The question is not whether the schedule should be re-
formed. The question is how reform can be carried out in such
a manner as to make it possible for students to arrange their
own schedules, without also making the task of the professor
who must grade the exams impossible. The problem, then, is

not one of ends, but of means.

The proposals brought before

the EC last night show a sensible awareness of these facts—

and a sensible awareness that some change is needed.

THE RING-

By PATRICK AREY
Staff Writer

George Wallace is a small, intense
man. Hair carefully combed, well
dressed, his appearance is far from
the stereotyped Southern politician
image of past years,

Making his way through the crowd
at Roanoke College last Saturday
afternoon, one couldn't help but be
disappointed at the man’s appearance.
He hardly looks the racist that he is
supposed to be.

As he mounted the platform, his
half dozen bodyguards placed them-
selves nearby, but not at any discreet
distance.

Speaking of the common man, us-
ing as an example the textile workers
he had spoken to in Danville the day
before, Wallace always says “we.”
Rarely does he say “I” or “you,”
usually it’s “we” or “us.”

“The average man don’t understand |
it,” Wallace said, talking about the
current American scene, and especi-
ally the summer riots. Then speaking
of the “average man” from Alabama,
he said, “They can call us rough-
necks, rednecks, and bigots, but there
are a lot like us in New York, Cali-
fornia, and Virginia.” Appropriate
applause followed.

The crowd was not big, perhaps |
a thousand. Students were sitting on
the lawn, many beards among them.
Outside the immediate area which had
been cordoned off, was the public
which had come to see the man.

The applause which came through-
out the speech was marked by the
enthusiasm of the public, and little
among the students. The students
had come to hear, but they didn't
seem to be buying Wallace's brand.

The reporters who were following
Wallace on his two day tour through
the state didn't bother taking notes.
He said the same thing wherever he
went.

The
tacked

theme was the same: he at-
the “liberal” press, “theor-
eticians, professors,” _ intellectuals,
vietniks, and always, the federal
establishment.

“Stir things up...”

His first statement was a defense
of the Constitution, Our purpose, he
said, is “to defend property owner-
ship and the free enterprise system.”
Without property rights, he asked, are
there any rights? Look at the com-
munist system, he said.

Other themes he struck were schools,
the Vietnam war, law and order, and
newspapers.

Wallace received loud applause
when he told the group that unless
President Johnson or the 1968 Re-
publican presidential nominee prom-
ises to return the operation of the
schools to the states, he will run “and
we will stir things up...”

Local citizens, Wallace said, have
the “morality, ability, and the intel-
ligence” to run their own schools.

On the Vietnam war and foreign
aid, Wallace said, instead of sanction-
ing the British for trading with the

George Wallace: The

North
desia.

If he becomes president, Wallace
said he would cut off foreign aid to
countries that do not do their part
in fighting communism. Unconcerned
with America’s image abroad, Wallace
said the time has come “to let them
worry about what we think of them
instead of us worrying about what
they think of us.”

His greatest applause came when
Wallace blamed the U. S. Supreme
Court and President Johnson for
violence in the streets. The police, he
said, are the “thin line” between
anarchy and order within the coun-
try.

There is no excuse, he said, for
destruction of the internal security
of this country.

On the “liberal” press, Wallace
quoted former Arkansas Governor
Orval Faubus, who said, “Life is made
for people who couldn't read, and
Time for those who couldn’t think.”

Speaking of the New York Times,
Wallace said, if the balance of power
has slipped to the Communists, it’s
due to moral support in America.

Concerning communists, Wallace
says he knows one by instinct.

Evolution of Openings

W&L’s First

Fall dances seem to have been
popular at W&L for almost a cen-
tury, but there has not always been
a fixed dance known as “Openings.”
Our present form of Openings Dances
is the result of a gradual evolution
which is outlined below:

 

The first Calyx (1876) contains a
paragraph about a “Fancy Dress Hop”
held in October. This was not an
annual affair however. By 1879, there
was what was known as the Hop
Club, which had the responsibility
of giving a fall dance.

In 1897, the first year of the Ring-
tum Phi’s publication, the paper an-
nounced that the “Cotillion Club gave
a very delightful hop on the eighth
(of October).” This is the first refer-
ence to the Cotillion Club, which was
to play a major role in the develop-
ment of Openings until the club ceas-
ed to exist in the 1950's,

In this year, the “Opening Hop”
featured, according to the Calyx, “a
large number of visiting young ladies
from Lynchburg, Richmond, and
Staunton.”

In the early part of the century,
dances in October were almost totally
obscured by fall football, which
weekly occupied the entire front page
of the Ring-tum Phi. Fall dances still
went on, but the only published

reference to the Opening Hop in 1916
was a small, sixth page article in the
R-t P which stated that VMI was

dance,

The influence of the Great War

was felt in the 1917 hop. The new
Doremus Gymnasium was decorated
with the national colors, and VMI
first-classmen attended.

In 1919, for the first time, the
Ring-tum Phi ran a small front page
article on the dance. “Especially in-
teresting,” announced the paper, “were
the ‘jazzations’ of the drummer, whose
work on the traps and general de-
meanor on the platform was enough
to stop the dance and attract myriads
around him.”

1925

Opening Hop was on October 17,
and was informal, the music being
furnished by the now-defunct “South-
ern Collegians” (reputed to be rein-
carnated as the “Hot Nuts”). Fresh-
men were required to wear green
bow-ties to the hop and could only
stay an hour unless they had dates
or were on the freshmen football
squad,

Four years later, Wall Street crash-
ed, but depression conditions didn’t
seem to affect the gaity of the “Open-
ing Dance” (as it was called by then)

which featured the “Carolina Tar-
heels.”

In ‘35 the traditional fall dance

was combined with Homecoming to
create the “Homecoming Dances.”

played the Wahoos. The price to the
dance set was $2.50, and the weekend
featured Jelly Leftwich and Band.
By 1936, the Ring-tum Phi finally
considered the fall dance newsworthy
enough to give it a page-wide head-
line. As usual, the Cotillon Club made
the arrangements for the weekend,
whose cost had risen to $5.50 per
student. On the 16th of October, the
Sophomore gave their dance, followed

Despite the poor student support in
1941 and a resulting Dance Board
deficit of $387.15, not to mention war-

as usual, featuring Bobby Byrne and
the VMI Commanders. From 1943 to
1946, Openings was not held.

In 1947, Openings came back to
life with the pre-war type of dance.

Generals Chall

Rudd Smith Boots Way
Into National Punting List

By SHELDON MILLER

Rutherford Paul Crooks Smith,
otherwise known as Rudd Smith, has
suddenly found himself to be ranked
as the third best punter in small
college ball. The N.C.A.A. ratings
showed a two way tie for first at
47.5 yds. per kick, and then Rudd
in third with a 46.0 yd. average.
These ratings were after only one
game in which Smith kicked 9 times
for 414 yds. Last Saturday against
Randolph-Macon Smith again kicked
9 times, but his total yardage was
somewhat less at 365.

Coach Mac explains this drop by
saying, “Rudd was called on to kick
out of bounds and for field position
several times. This hurt his average,
but was a necessary team effort.”

At the present time Rudd’s average
stands at 43.3, having kicked 18 times

ably drop some in rankings, but with
the season just underway, it would
appear that W&L will have a nation-
ally ranked kicker,

Rudd hails from Summerville, S. C.
where he also punted for his high
school team. At present Rudd is a
Sigma Nu, senior and also Co-Captain
of this year’s squad,

Asked if he had practiced kicking
this summer Rudd said that he had
little opportunity. “I spent the sum-
mer in Naval Reserve Camp at New-
port, R.I. It's right on a windy bay
and almost impossible to punt.”

This year punting duties have fallen
on Rudd as they have in the two
previous years. At the moment Rudd
is confined to punting due to an in-
jury acquired in a pre-season game
against Elong College when Rudd
cracked several ribs,

Coach Mac hails Rudd as a versa-
tile player. This can be attributed to
the fact that as a sophomore Rudd
played both ways and last year was
a defensive specialist.

Unfortunately, some of Rudd's
better punts have had long returns,
such as the 69 yd. TD return made
against us by Guilford. Coach Mac
credits these returns to a new NCAA
rule concerning kick coverage. “This
year the lineman can not leave the

It has been several years since such
a regular feature has appeared in
this paper, a feature devoted solely
and seriously to athletics at Wash-
ington and Lee. Perhaps the reason
for this has been a lack of willing
writers, but, in my opinion, it has
had more to do with the general
attitude among the student body con-
cerning the spirit of athletics at this
universily

Although no one who is today a
student at WAL had any direct ac-
quaintance with the athletic scandal

| and subsequent desubsidization actions |

of 1954, the present student body is,
1 believe, the receipient of a wave
of feeling these events produced,
With desubsidization came small-time
athletics, and in the minds of many,
this was equated with “bush-league-

ness,” a phrase which easily evoked
a “Who cares?” attitude. Since 1954,
that feeling has made itself felt with
varying degrees of intensity on the
Washington and Lee sports scene.
But several occurrences the last
few years have done much to dispell
the belief that small-time athletics is

| not good athletics. The two outstand-

ing General football elevens of 1960
and 1961 announced the rebirth of
WA&L on the gridiron. It has become
common knowledge that the best col-
legiate tennis in the State of Virginia
is played beneath the “World's Long-
est Concrete Footbridge.” And finally,
as anyone who witnessed the CAC
Basketball Tournament last year can
tell you, the freshman “suicide swan
dive” is no longer the most exciting
event in Doremus Gymnasium. That
honor falls to Messrs. Cartwright,

olonels Saturday

Fresh from a highly spirited con-
test with Randolph-Macon, Washing-
ton and Lee’s “Big Blue” is anxiously
awaiting the Saturday encounter with
tough Centre College—a game that
literally smacks with a chance for
another conference championship by
the Generals.

Coach Lee McLaughlin, in a recent
interview, seemed to express the pre-
vailing optimism exhibited by the
team. Coach “Mac,” evidently pleased
with the fine performance of quarter-
back Bloom, stated “The best place
to hurt Centre is with our passing-
game—you can't run against them
very often for long gains.” Although
the Generals do have short passes in
their repertoire, fans should expect
a number of pass attempts for reason-
ably good distances.

Commenting on the offensive at-
tack of Centre, Coach “Mac” also
noted, “They have been hitting for
the boomer, as well as pushing for
the needed yardage by a fine ground
| attack.” However, from the recent
display of adept pass protection and
the show of a strong forward front
against a ground attack by Randolph-
Macon, Centre’s offense could be de-
cisively hampered.

One key advantage in the strategy
for “Big Blue is the quick kick—a well
evidenced surprise against the Macon
Yellowjackets. Combined with a fine
passing game, this play might well
make that all important difference in
the key moments of the game, when
surprise is needed. Indeed, Centre has
yet to exhibit any quick kick, thus

Injuries will always plague a foot-

confident that any open position will
be adequately filled by experience and
enthusiasm—a combination hard to

been the victim for injuries, with

development programs, warning that
such programs as the renovation of
the Trobadour Theater are “a stop-
gap, not a permanent solution” to
problems of physical expansion. He
noted that alumni response to fund
appeals has been adequate but un-
impressive: “We believe it can be
better.”

A question-and-answer period fol-
lowed the talks.

The delegates and their wives were
the guests of Acting President and
Mrs. Pusey after the opening session.
During the social hour members of
the faculty and administration talked
informally with the delegates.

Afte dinner in Evans Dining Hall,
the alumni and their wives adjourned
to the Alumni House to talk in-
formally and at length about Uni-
versity concerns.

foday’s activities began at 9 a.m.
in Lee Chapel. Dean of the College
Pusey, Dean Lewis W. Adams of
the School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration, and Dean E. R. Huntley
of the Law Schol, discussed the status
of their respective schools and ex-
plored with the delegates the chal-
lenges and opportunities the schools
face.

At 1 p.m. the delegates had lunch
with 30 students representing every
facet of student life. No faculty mem-
ber or administrative officer was pres-
ent at this session. Richard Nash,
President of the Executive Committee
of the Student Body, presided.

After lunch the delegates heard
from Dr. Edward C. Atwood, Dean
of Students and chairman of the Ad-
missions Committee, Mr. James D.
Farrar, Director of Admission, and
Mr. William A. Noel, Director of
Financial Aid. They explained the
University’s admissions standards and
practices, the function of the faculty
committee on admissions and the
availability and allocation of financial
aid,

ably wouldn't get the point across).
According to Ed Side, Saturday and
Sunday are the best night of the
week, varying in direct proportion to
weather, sporting events, hour quizzes,
and the tube (to whit, last year when
the Pit-Lyric was playing One-Eyed
Jacks, so was the Columbia Broad-
casting System). However, with Ed
Side’s current program of relatively
current foreign films, he does not feel
that television is as great a draw.

Ed Side lives above the Pit-Lyric,
as do several W&L students, one of
whom claims that the noise doesn’t
bother him; however, after two days
listening to it, there’s no way that
you can resist seeing the flick.

Few things have changed at the
Lyric-Pit. The announcement “Pre-
views of Coming Attractions” is as
antique as the theater, built in the
dirty-thirties. The infamous Mid-
night Show on the eve of school
vacations no longer exists because
of the fairly destructive acts of
student-celebrants, one of whom
hurled a bottle through the screen.

This allows for longer returns and
fewer fair catches.”

Without a very potent offense a
team will find that it needs good
kicking specialists. This year W&L
finds itself with two extremely good
returning lettermen. One is Smith and
the other is Cary Green.

Green, a PiKA from Bowling Green,

Va. showed his graceful field goal
style last week by zeroing in on the
crossbars for two long fields and
an extra point that provided the mar-
gin of victory.
“Although Smith and Green are dif-
ferent types of kickers, they have one
thing in common—do something
when the drive stalls.

This week should be a strong test
for these two capable kickers, be-
cause if W&L is to beat Centre they
will need to keep them as deep in
their own territory as possible and
will need to score every chance they
have, whether it be a 40 yd. field
goal or an extra point. This will be
the duties of Smith and Green.

is an epileptic approximation of real
movement. It is as if Aldrich and
his associates hoped all that thrash-
ing around would warm them into
life. In other words, when they aren't
beating up Germans the characters
don’t really do anything. Johnson and
Heller have had to intrduce a lot of
military humor (jokes about the brass,
jokes about the food, etc.) to fill
up blank spaces in the film caused
by dearth of good characterization.
Chance for Fine Story

The fact that the prisoners don't
come off as dramatic creations also
stops short development of another of
the film’s possibilities (if you don’t
think the prisoners fail to be realized
as believable characters, try for a
minute to imagine them outside of
the film's immediate context), There
was the chance for a fine story about
the transition and integration of
twelve all but unintegratable indivi-
duals into a cohesive group. Unfor-
tunately, the fact that we aren't pre-
sented with twelve individuals pretty
well precludes this possibility. I sup-
pose if the artists involved had been
more attentive to, and more patient
with, details concerning the period of
training, or to the sensitivity of the
men as concerns others conceptions
and opinions of them, something like

who is a student-athlete in the truest
sense of the word, deserves recogni-

his classmates are at the Liquid or

It looks as if the pendulum is start-

the grounds for group cohesiveness

cooperation, for unity, and even for

There is little to add except that
“The Dirty Dozen” is doing except-

this is because it is enjoyable if a

This is, presumably, the way most

I'm afraid mean nothing to such

any other work of art, involves more

Exams

(Continued from page 1)
Committee to get one of the exams
changed to a more convenient date,
to be agreed upon mutually by the
student and the professor, As the
schedule now stands, a student must
have four exams or 11 hours of
courses in two days to petition
for a change.

Lee Halford, who headed the com-
mittee which made the proposal, em-
phasized that the committee will con-
tinue to study ways to introduce a
completely flexible exam schedule in
which students may decide when they
will take exam. For the moment, how-
ever, Halford and the EC agreed this
plan was the most practical.

These ideas are to be submitted to
the Faculty Committee on Courses
and Degrees on Tuesday.

Another facet of the proposal stated
that students taking a make-up exam
will be pledged not to talk about the
exam if the professor so desires. This
will keep a professor from having to
make out new exams for each student.

Herb Crenshaw, junior representa-
tive, wondered if this would confuse
the students ,since some professors
will ask for pledges and others will
not. It was pointed out that this
situation exists now for hour tests and
presents no apparent problems.

Further studies on how many stu-
dents this proposal will affect are to
be made before the final draft is pre-
sented to the faculty.

 

As the players staggered off the
course, lamenting about their scores
and nursing the multitude of wounds
inflicted by the flies, it became patently
obvious that the new golf season was
going to be not better or worse than

its predecessors.
