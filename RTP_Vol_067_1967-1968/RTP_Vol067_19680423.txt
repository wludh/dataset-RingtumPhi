stantial margins over their opponents.

The presidential candidates will

The percentage voting was not
especially high for a Big Four election
because there were very few issues
to provoke a large turnout. 74.7%
of the students participated in the
election.

The present EC cited Article Il,
Section B, Part 3 of the student body

 

 

 

constitution in its decision to conduct
another election for the office of
president.

“If no simple majority is obtained
by a candidate, there shall be a run-
off election between the two candi-
dates receiving the largest number of
votes.”

The runoff race is the first in recent
history and possibly the first in the
history of the school. Prior to 1965
the “Party Caucuses” selected candi-
dates and there were rarely more
than two in any major race.

There had been some questioning
of last Thursday's primary in the
form of a letter from John Paul, a
law student. The EC disallowed his
argument on the grounds that there
was no specific prohibition in the
student body constitution of primaries.

Foreign Study
Is Available
To W&L Men

By DAVID B. DICKENS

 

 

A year abroad? Or a semester, or
even a summer? Such a program, run
by Washington and Lee, does not
yet exist. Yet there are still many
possibilities for the WAL student to
study abroad and to receive credit for |
his work. President Huntley has ex-
pressed his approval of the value of
study abroad for students in foreign
languages, other fields of the humani-
ties and the social sciences in well
organized programs co-ordinated by
the Foreign Study Committee.

Various programs now in existence
und sponsored by other colleges and

universities are open to WAL appli-
cants, WAL’'s Foreign Study Com
mittee urges interested students to

investigate them. Students contemplat-
ing study abroad must have a cumu
lative GPR of 2.5 through mid-
semesier of their sophomore year
Upon fulfillment of this requirement,
students should then learn about exist
ing programs in their field of in

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper

Tuesday, April 23, 1968

 

Still another ‘theatre’- building disaster
(fast becoming a regular column,

to be called ‘Bringing Down the House’)

Another incident in our local version of the seven plagues
of Egypt: the squalid, obnoxious building which around here
is laughingly called a “theatre’’ caught fire Saturday evening—
while there were several people inside it. Mercifully, the fire
was put out before it had a chance to spread and kill. By the
way, this latest episode is not to be confused with the times,
all of them during this academic year, when the ground floor
was flooded by its own sprinkler system, triggered off by its
own heating system; or when a tree fell down upon the build-
ing and caved in part of the roof while play rehearsals were
going on; or when part of the insides fell down onto a student
worker, sending him to the hospital.

It seems it’ll be a race against time, to see whether the
building crumbles to dust (hopefully, when nobody is in it)
before the new little theatre can be constructed several years
from now; or even before the $35,000 addition, of a lobby and
the building’s very first bathrooms, is completed (the addition
is being built right now, in efforts to make the place a little
less Dogpatch-ish until we have the new theatre).

—_—__ oo -——_——_——_——

We wrote those first two paragraphs before learning that
the fire was not accidental. The building is so remarkably
decrepit that one automatically assumes it’s an act of nature
when parts of it crumble and collapse, or sink into the earth,
or burn down. It is impossible for us to even imagine what sort
of madman it was who amused himself by playing games with
gasoline in that particular building, the world’s most likely
tinder-box.

Work Begins

Lobby construction well under way.

On Additions

For The Troub’s Theater

The Lexington Housing Authority
will soon be able to scratch another
sub-standard building off its con-
demnation list. The Troubadour
rheatre has for years been cited for
its lack of restrooms and proper heat-
ing, which brought discomfort and
dismay to the audience and perform-
ers. But on March 26, construction
was begun to eliminate these defi-
ciences plus greatly increasing the
floor space.

The first addition is a lobby with
an adjoining lighting and sound
booth. Upon completion of major
portions of this addition, the con-
struction of a Troubadour workshop
will begin. Troub Director Lee Kahn
summed up his joy over the new con-
struction with “Hallelujah! Hallelu-
jah! At long last.”

New Lobby

Now well under construction is the
lobby which will have a large new
ticket desk, restrooms, a coatroom,
and display cases. The display cases
will contain pictures of past perform-
ances plus selections from the historic
Reeves Collection of Colonial porce-
lain.

Bricks have been selected to blend
in as well as possible with the present
building. The lobby will be a little
over a story high with the roof reach-
ing to the present second floor win-

dows. Surrounding the new addition
will be a patio extending partially
into the old parking lot next to the
Town Inn. To reach this patio and
the new entrance to the theatre, steps
will be built on Henry Street next to
the Sigma Nu house.

Equipment for the lighting and
sound booth has already been secured,
although at least two new dimmers
may be necessary, according to Mr.
Kahn.

New Workshop

The new workshop will branch off
to the left of the theater front on
Main Street. The new building will
be 30 x 30, large enough to be used
for storage, scenery construction and
stage left during performances. This
section will also contain a modern,
quiet heating system capable of
comfortably heating the entire theater.

Mr. Kahn will be able to have two
classes at once now due to a gift
from Mr. Bernard Schecter of New
York. Mr, Schecter’s gift to the theater
is two massive sound-proof doors to
separate the workshop from the
theatre. When these doors are closed
there will be no interference between
directing or scenery classes.

These improvements to the theater,
plus earlier additions of seats and

 

— are estimated by Mr. Kahn

to have a cost of nearly $35,000.

 

Then And Now: How To
Pick Publications Editors

By BOB KEEFE

This is an anniversary week: the
thirtieth time the Publications Board
has met to select editor-in-chief and
business managers for the Ring-tum
Phi and for the University’s yearbook
and student magazines.

A constitutional amendment, tak-
ing the top publications positions out
of the sordid, semi-open arena of
general elections and putting them
under the aegis of the Publications
Board, was passed nearly unanimously
(the Clique whips were off this amend-
ment) in 1937, to go into effect in
1938.

In the beginning (so far as we
can tell)—prior to about 1900—the
heads of each publication named their
successors as they saw fit, privately
and on their own, in secret and prob-
ably graft-filled sessions.

The Collegian was at that time run
by the literary societies, which pre-
sumably elected editors and managers,
There is no telling what the Calyx
did, there having been no chronicle,
reliable or otherwise, of such W&L
activities before 1897 and the advent
of the Ring-tum Phi.

Birth of the R-t Phi

The Ring-tum Phi itself was begun
by one J, Slusser as a private money-
making venture; he served as business
manager, and reportedly the job paid
his way through school. He and his
editor named their successors intra-
murally at first, too,

Then, somewhere early in the new
century, somebody realized that these
six plums—three editors and three
business managers—ought to be put
on the political tree. So the publica-
tion positions were thrown open to
the general public.

Almost immediately, things began
to degenerate. The Ring-tum Phi
suffered least, but even it was buffeted
now and again by the blatant lack of
capability of some editors who were
elected because of football ability and
general popularity with no regard to
journalistic fitness.

Birth of the Board

In 1920, the six publication heads
had begun to see what could happen
if elections continued as so many free-
for-alls. In a sort of apprehension,
they banded together and formed the
Publications Board; it had no power
at first, and hoped only to exercise
informal, sobering influence.

Things came to a head a little while
later. One man came a hair's breadth
from being elected: although he was
a transfer student and had been here
only four months and had never once

And such larceny is a major prob-

only police car) or summoned by bells
on utility poles, The “office” consisted
of a nine by twelve room; there were
no communications and one pair of
handcuffs for cight officers.

Now there are fifteen officers,
three cars, a motorcycle, and equip-
ment commensurate with modern

police technology for a city of Lex-
ington’s size.

Youngest In The State

Joining the force in 1946 as partrol-
man, Rhodenizer was promoted to
sergeant and then to the first appoint-
ment in Lexington of a first liewtenant.
At the age of 22, he was named Chief
by the Mayor and the City Council
in 1949,

The Chief requires all his men to
attend the Central Police Training
School in Richmond, and his officers’
training is continuous in the Super-
visors’ School.

 

 

set foot in the newspaper office, he
was an immensely popular football
player and therefore gathered 49 per
cent of the vote.

Meantime, the editors who had been
elected were putting out papers that
were progressively growing shakier.
They would take off for weekends
occasionally, and there just wouldn't
be a Phi at all the following week.
The issues that were published were
more and more becoming organs for
certain fraternities, political points of
view, and honor groups.

So the Publications Board proposed
an amendment to the Constitution—
it would endorse two experienced
candidates for each publication office,
and the student body would choose
betwen them. No blatantly unexperi-
enced man could run and win, the
Board thought; the chances of in-
competence and inefficiency would be
minimized; and yet the electoral fac-
tor would remain to assuage the
politicians’ consciences.

‘Fundamental Necessity’

The Ring-tum Phi, ably edited by
A. C. Kelley, was almost fanatically
in favor of the amendment, Being on
the inside, Kelley said, he could not
fail to see the fundamental necessity
of limiting editorial and business-
managerial candidacies to men with
some experience, who could reason-
ably be expected to put out an ac-
ceptable _publication—which was
proven in the past, almost disastrously,
not to be the case with open elections.

 

Why the Ring-tum Phi
Never Got Out On Time
In the Old Days

Besides the quality of the paper it-
self, the argument ran, there was
virtually no channel of responsibility.
The elected editor was supreme. It
was grossly impractical to suppose
that the student body would initiate
a recall if an inexperienced editor
committed an irresponsible act. Sev-
eral of the elected editors were journ-
alism majors, and it could be pre-
sumed that they would be careful;
but there was no guarantee or even
reasonable assurance. The transfer
student who came within 12 votes of
being elected had no qualifications at
all.

So the amendment was passed over-
whelmingly. The student body had
grown sick of certain years in which
there were no papers, late papers and
scandal papers.

Back Dowahill

For a while, everything went de-
cently. Capable editors and business
managers were elected for all three
publications. But in the late 20's and
early "30's, quality again started going
downhill. The Clique ran politics here
then; the Clique decided who was
going to edit and manage the publica-
tons.

The Publications Board endorse-
ments came to be such a farce that
the Clique would nominate its candi-
date a week or more before the Publi-
cations Board even met to give its
“endorsement.” Even the Clique-ap-
pointed editors ridiculed the system
Latham Weber, Clique-member editor
in 1937 (ater director of publicity
at WAL), periodically voiced the need
for basic reform in the system that
had appointed him

Editors came and went, When one
displeased the Clique in 1934, he
simply disappeared from further con-
nection with the paper. His name was
removed from the staff box, and a
more loyal Cliquer was named “act
ing editor” for the rest of the year

Towson Wins In 2nd Overtime

 

Saturday afternoon, the lacrosse
team dropped a double-overtime de-
cision to Towson State, 6 to 4. It
was the Generals’ fourth loss of the
season as compared with one victory.

Coach Szlasa said that his players
did a good job: “I couldn't ask any
more ... | was pleased with their
effort.” Towson possessed an except-
ionally fine goalie as he blocked shot
after shot. The Generals’ defense also
did an excellent job, but just couldn't
hold Towson. Bill Brumback, Harold
Stowe, Charlie Stewart and Dave
Johnson were cited by Coach Szlasa
for their determination and good play.

In the first overtime both sides
went scoreless but in the second, with

214 elapsed minutes, Towson managed | |

to score. With only a short time re-
maining the Generals had to cast
caution to the wind and desperately

try to tie the score again. This re- |
sulted in another score for Towson. |
Tom Pittman led the Generals’)

scoring with three; Joe Wich got the |

other one. Assists were earned by Bob
Frost, Hugh Baugher, and Chip Chew.

Though their 1-4 record isn't as
good as they had hoped for the
lacrosse team's spirits are still high
for finishing up the season with a

winning record. It would mean wine
ning the next four games against |
Washington College, Duke, Roanoke,
and U.Va. They have the talent to
do it, all they need is a little luck
and a great deal of determination.
As Coach Szlasa

 

said about the |

Towson game “they did everything
but win.” Maybe that last element will
be included in the next four games.
A little support might go along way
towards helping them; there should
be something to a home advantage
besides a familiar field.

 

As Roanoke College was grinding
out a 75-61 victory over the Generals,
Mike Neer set out to break the)
school high jump record; he cleared |
6542” to accomplish his goal.

Other General winners were Bob)
Stack in the mile, Doug Deaton in|
the discus, Phil Jones in the shot, |
Sam Hinkle in the 220 and Corbet |
Bryant in the two-mile.

The Generals will take on Bridge-
water today and Old Dominion Satur-
day. Both meets are at home.

Coach Canfield’s netmen boosted ,
their season record to 4-1 with a 6-3/
win over Randolph Macon last Fri-
day afternoon. The match was played |
at Macon under clear skies which |
seemed to favor the Generals as they
had little trouble with the Yellow
Jackets. The Generals captured the
first four singles matches and the!
second and third doubles.

Coach Canfield had a great deal |
of praise for all his players but
singled out Tommy Rueger and Don
McClure for particularly fine efforts. |
“Rueger’s desire to win was instru-
mental in our victory:” “fine effort on
the part of McClure.” McClure who!
as a junior is in his third year on the
varsity is the only undefeated member
of the squad. Don was the only player:
to win against Duke which defeated |
the Generals 8-1. Don has been over-|

Dorm Questions

(Continued from Page 2)

man hall with a living room, and so
forth.)

Would parietal rules have to be
modified; and if to what extent?
What provisions, if any, would have
to be made for entertaining dates in
dorm rooms? Where does the reason-
able compromise lie between students’
wishes and the University’s responsi-
bilities?

Would any upperclassmen at all
have to be required to live in dorms?
Would it be to the University’s
advantage to offer attractive dormi-
tories as an addition to rather than
as a restriction on the choices students
now have?

Would the academic atmosphere
of the University be enhanced by our
becoming a residential college?

Closely related is the question of
whether the University must make an
irrevocable decision concerning
whether or not to prohibit non-fra-
ternity-house, non-dorm housing be-
fore at least some dorms could be
constructed.

Other entangling questions tied up
with these observations: If dorm rules
were modified, what corresponding
changes would have to be made in
fraternity-house rules? With so many
other irons in the fire, just where
should dorms be placed on the priority
list? Where does the point of equi-
librium lie between a worthwhile in-
vestment and students’ liberty of
choice? How lavish could dorms be
and still rent out for reasonable sums?
