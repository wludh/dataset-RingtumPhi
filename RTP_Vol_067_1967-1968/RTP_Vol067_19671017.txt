that there is a limitation of 12 hours

Sandler based the need for the

Student Driving Restrictions

Concern over student driving has become a major topic of
discussion in Virginia. Beginning with a series of editorials in
the Richmond Times-Dispatch the discussion has spread to the
editorial page of the Lexington News-Gazette. The controversy
is now brought to Washington and Lee.

We feel that the editorial in last week’s News-Gazette, if
associated with the letter to the editor on the same page, de-
serves comment. (The implications of the letter are examined
in a story elsewhere on this page.)

In the News-Gazette editorial, ‘‘Student-Owned Auto-
mobiles,” there is a reprint of the three principles upon which
the Times-Dispatch basses its “opposition to student cars.”
The editorial’s first point is that college is already very ex-
pensive and that status requires every student to have a car.
W&L is a good example that this is not the rule. Many students
can easily afford cars, and those who can’t don’t suffer because
the affluent lend them. Furthermore, if there were no cars,
there are other expensive sources of status.

Secondly the quoted Times-Dispatch editorial contended
that on weekends the students leave en masse, frequently
neglecting studies and maiming and killing themselves in smash-
ups. The car is not the only excuse for neglecting studies. There |
are hundreds of temptations, from television to women. Every
student can tell you another way to pass time. As for accidents,

This is the first of a two-part
series on past presidents of the Uni-
versity. —Editor.

A valorous attempt to construct a
composite of Washington and Lee
presidents has failed. Since the in-
corporation of the University in 1782,
only one factor about the presidents
has been constant. All fourteen were
political Democrats,

Geographic Variety

It cannot be said they were born
in the South because two were from
Pennsylvania and one was from Brit-
ish Guiana, South America. The liv-
ing presidents during the War Be-
tween the States did not even side
with Robert E. Lee—two moved to
Philadelphia for the duration, Occu-
pationally there is a hodge-podge
from the clergy to the political realm.
They were not all unactive in revolu-
tionary movements, as one led a de-
tachment while serving as president
of the College in the American Revo-
lution. And one was even arrested
for taking part in mob activity of

the other modes of travel are dangerous themselves. The two |

alternatives, with fewer cars, would be to dangerously overload
the cars or force students to hitch-hike with all of its related
dangers.

The editorial’s third point is that campuses are becoming

 

cluttered with cars; this will remain the case until “action is
taken to prohibit most students from having automobiles.” |

|
|

Washington and Lee has already taken a realistic approach to |

this problem with its restrictions. All freshmen, students on
academic probation and students on scholarships are prohibited
from having cars in Rockbridge County. Besides alleviating
the clutter problem our restrictions realistically meet the first
two points in the Times-Dispatch editorial.

The handicaps of seeking status most threaten students on
scholarship. The restrictions quickly eliminate the temptation
to buy a car. And study neglect is the rationale behind the
prohibition for academically poor students.

The News-Gazette suggests that only seniors be allowed
to have cars and that there be scholastic restrictions. The first
suggestion is not realistic for Washington and Lee, and the
second is already in effect.

The Sunday Times-Dispatch praises the Princeton plan
for the nation. At Princeton the students are not allowed to
have cars within the city limits of the town or on the campus
of the University. This would be ideal, but is rather unfeasible
for our situation and nearly every other we have experienced.
We do agree with the additional parking lots suggested in the
editorial; and the University will soon have to expand its pres-
ent facilities.

Over the years our restrictions have been criticized as being
too severe, but in the light of the present discussion, they are
realistically progressive and fair. —J.W.

Unsuccessful Effort

| The effort to prophesy or predict

us anything, it is that our new one
has a lot to live up to.

 

In the historical development of the
university, the beginning was 1749 as
Augusta Academy by Robert Alex-
ander under the guidance of the Pres-
byterian Church. This school of the
industrious Scotch-Irish was in 1774
headed by Rev. William Graham
Graham was from Paxton Township,
Pennsylvania and had graduated in
1773 from Princeton. His classmates
included James Madison and Henry
“Light Horse Harry” Lee, father of a
later university president. He helped
coach Lee in philosophy and was
credited by him for his passing

William Graham was presiding
when the name of the school was
changed to Liberty Hall in 1776 as
an act of independence he stepped
forward, drawing others who elected
him captain of the company. But the
detachment was never called to battle.
In 1782 the Virginia Legislature in-
corporated the school so that it could
award degrees. Before he retired from
il! health in 1796, Graham began the
construction of the stone school on a

Washington's Bequest

George Washington in 1796 donat-
ed $50,000 in James River Canal
Company stock to the school, and in
1798 the school honored its greatest
benefactor by changing the name to
Washington Academy.

A 1788 graduate of Liberty Hall
next assumed leadership. Dr. Samuel
L. Campbell of Rockbridge County

 

was president from 1797-1799. He
was also an honor graduate from
medical school in Philadelphia and |!

had a large practice throughout the
valley. He further served as treasurer
of the Hall until 1803, and his four
sons all graduated from the school.

George Addison Baker was the next
president for thirty years of progress.
He had been trained under William
Graham at Liberty Hall and was a
preaching evangelist. In 1798 he re-
turned to the school as chairman of |
the mathematics and natural philoso-
phy department, A year later he be-
came president. In 1803 the school
was moved to its present location as
the stone building had burned a
year earlier.

changed by the Virginia legislature in
1813 to Washington College, and in
1824 the main building on the hill,
Washington Hall, was constructed at
a cost of $9,000. Dr. Baker retired
in 1829 to his pastorate in Lexington,
but in 1835 he spent the last year of
his life president of Hampden-
Sydney College.

Educated Abroad

The fourth president was Louis
Marshall, youngest brother of Chief
Justice John Marshall. He was born
in Fauquier County, Va., but was edu-
cated in Edinburgh and Paris, where
he studied medicine. As a student in
Paris during the early years of the
Revolution he witnessed the massacre
of the Swiss guards, was present at
the storming of the Bastille, and was
accused to have participated in the
violence of the mob in Paris. It was
reported he was arrested and con-
demned to death, but was saved by
the influence of his brothers. He later
never spoke of this period.

By JOE WILSON
as

A letter in the current issue of the
Lexington News-Gazette has caused a
storm of controversy. The letter was
“mainly concerned with the increas-
ing number of serious automobile
accidents involving local college stu-
dents, particularly those at Washing-
ton and Lee University,” according
to its writer,

The letter was obviously a sincere
plea for highway safety but the blame
| for accidents was obviously unfairly
and incorrectly placed on W&L stu-
dents. The Rev. Albert J. Schrader,
pastor of the Trinity Methodist Church
and chaplain of the Lexington Rescue
Squad, is the author of the letter, and
has had to witness many serious acci-
dents. The viewing of one accident

school. He was appointed president
of the College in 1830 and resigned
in 1834, In 1835 he became president
of Transylvania College in Lexington, |
Ky., and in 1866 he died at his home
in Woodford.

Henry Vethake was born in Es
sequibo, British Guiana in 1792, and
moved to the United States when very
young. He was graduated from Co
lumbia College, and the University ol
the city of New York before coming
to Washington College in 1834. He
taught intellectual and moral philoso
phy while president, but in 1836 went
to the University of Pennsylvania and

Revealing Statistics

Rev. Schrader calls for action to
deal “with the ever-increasing prob-
lem of drinking and driving.” Accord-
ing to the records of the Lexington
Police Department from 1963 through
May, 1967, 133 local citizens have
been arrested for reckless driving.
WAL students accounted for 51 of
these. And 63 local citizens have been
convicted for “driving under the in-
fluence.” Significant, only five of
these have been WAL students. This
is a notable record in that only seven
per cent were WAL students while

ident in 1848. He held office until
the war in 1861 when he resigned.

John C. Calhoun praised Dr, Jun-
kin’s speech on slavery in the South
before the Synod of Cincinnati as “the
best defense “he had ever read.”

Dr. Junkin sympathized ardently
with the South, but, not believing in
state rights, and being the son of an
officer in the Revolution who had
shed his blood for the American
Union, he could not join in the seces-
sion movement. One of his daughters
married CSA Gen. Thomas J. “Stone-
wall” Jackson in the house on the
University campus closest to New-

comb Hall.

WGL Drinking, Driving
Receive Disputed Criticism

lhe letter offers suggestions to cope
with this “drinking and driving prob-
lem”:

1.) The entire student body should
be required to attend lectures on the
problem once a semester, This is un-
necessary because the students, under-
graduates and law, already under-
stand the seriousness,

2.) Fraternity and official socials
should be supervised by the admini-
stration and intoxicated students
should be kept from driving. The Uni
versity already requires administra-
tion-approved housemothers to be
present at all parties, and the driving
problem is almost completely handled
by the students. Students do watch
out for their dates, and if a driver
is intoxicated he will either voluntarily
or forcibly be replaced by a sober
student. This happens almost every
weekend at every house

3.) Drinking and driving regulations
for students should be made more
stringent, This police job, not
in the realm realistic University
control.

is a
of

4.) Possession of automobiles should
be prohibited to the junior year and
a bus system should be instituted, Al!
freshmen, students on scholarship and
academic probation are now prohibit-
ed from owning cars. There already
is an IFC bus system to the nearby
schools, but the girls prefer to ride
in cars—and insist on it. It is true
that over 95 per cent of students
eligible to own cars do own them, but
with so many now excluded, these
are in demand.

5.) The student union should be
immediately constructed and an on-
campus social program be instituted.
The ground-breaking for immediate
consiruction was yesterday, October

Booters Overwhelm WEM

By RIC BERARD

On a sun-drenched Smith Field last
Saturday, Washington and Lee’s soccer
team evened its record at 2-2 as it
defeated William and Mary by the
score of 7-0. But, as in all sports,
it wasn’t whether we won or lost
that was important; rather, how we
played the game.

You see, the Generals forgot their
accommodating role of the proper
host and instead vaporized the opposi-
tion that day before another larger-
than-intimate partisan gathering.

For although our visitors gave it the
old college try, this was only the
second year that they have even field-
ed a soccer team, and the first year
that their “coach” has ever known
that twenty-two men a football game
do not always make. Clearly, this
contest was another example of the
clever scheduling which we have all
come to know and love here at W&L.
As one of our soccer players correctly
stated after the game, “Our freshmen
could have beaten those guys.”

Yet it seems certain that this year’s

soccer team, following its question-
ably decisive victory over their Wil-
liamsburg opponents, will not be roll-
ing over any good team in quest of
another winning season. We are simp-
ly lacking the experience and, at times,
individual hustle, in order to be a
real threat to anyone good. If we are
to have a winning season this year,
then we shall have to continue to
defeat teams such as William and
Mary.

However, as Wililam and Mary
will readily concede, W&L does not
lack talent. And it is this factor which
should allow us to improve on our
present .500 record. For guided by
the superior play and leadership of
co-captains Craig and Harold, and
Seniors Tooker and Burroughs, the
Generals are building. And to this
end, Juniors Fechnay, Simmons and
Mitchell will be of great assistance
since few teams are going to shut out
Fechnay in any game and just as
few will be able to match the good
defensive play of fullback Simmons
and goalie Mitchell. In addition,
Sophomores Yow and Jamison and
Freshman Chyatt will add to our
offensive threat and ball control if
they continue to improve. But please,
don't look for any upsets this fall by
our Smith Field eleven—they need
to season a little more.

Saturday, then, was a day of vic-
tory and improvement for a W&l
team with first-rate potential, Against
a weak opponent, the offense learned
what it’s like to score often without
really trying, while the defense began
to jell in a shutout effort. And the
team’s total performance was suffici
ent to predict at least another winning
season this year
