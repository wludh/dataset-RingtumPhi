Atwood Leads
Assembly Today

E. C. Atwood, Jr., Dean of Stu-
dents, opened his Founder's Day
Speech this morning with allusions
to an earlier speech by Richard M.
Nixon, and requested that “standing
ovations be held to a minimum.”
“Rebels, Past and
Present,” Dean Atwood noted that
the University’s founders, George
Washington and Robert E. Lee, were
both rebels devoted to local autonomy
and the principle that the governed
should participate in their govern-
ment.

In speaking of

By drawing parallels to the motives
that animate students of today, At-
wood noted that the civil rights and
peace movements seem to be waning
and that students are more interested
in campus problems.

These problems they are trying to
solve by he same tactics used with

national issues. Atwood said that
this interest is greatly preferred to
the indifference of the 1950's, and

that, especially in allowing participa-
tion in student affairs, there has been
great progress.

But in the area of student participa
tion in academic affairs, there is much |
less agreement, since it “tradition-

to deal properly with an important

Leach, Jr., presently at the American
University at Beirut, Lebanon, and
on leave of absence from the Depart-
ment of Library Science of the Uni-
versity of Kentucky, Lexington, Ken-
tucky.

Having served as librarian at Wash-
ington College, Chestertown, Mary-
land, after World War Il, Mr. Cole-
man was appointed head librarian
under the administration of Francis
Pendleton Gaines. He has since con-
tinued in that capacity through two
other presidents and has initiated
numerous changes in the procedures,
assets, and physical plant at Mc-
Cormick Library.

R-t P: Mr. Coleman, have you en-
joyed working as librarian at Wash-
ington and Lee for the past twenty
years?

Coleman: It has been a very plea-
surable experience, but indeed hectic.
rhis library can be quite the rat-race
when it wishes.

R-t P: Have you gained much satis-
faction in the work here?

Coleman: Frustration, I

think,

 

would be better phraseology; | feel
that | could have done much more
than | have, as my attempts to alter
some policies have been thwarted.

R-t P: What was the condition of
McCormick Library, when you first
became head librarian?

Coleman: The library was in very
poor physical and financial condition
when I first took it over.

The library hours have been ex-
tended over 30 hours a week, and my
staff has been enlarged by several
members, three typewriters, an extra
microfilm reader, and a Xerox copy-
ing machine have all been added
since then to help the students in
their studies,

R-+t P: Have you composed any
lang-range plans, which the new li-
brarian will have to complete?

Coleman: Yes, | have several which

1 feel are necessary for a_ better
library. They include the completion
of the sixth stack, a new music

room, an improved ventilation system,
larger toilet facilities, additional study

affairs, party unity, extremism, ete.

A floor fight on some of the planks,
such as usually occurs at the real
national conventions, is not unex-
pected during the Washington and Lee
event.

Bellmon served as Oklahoma's gov-
ernor from 1963-67, then returned to
his 2,100-acre wheat and cattle farm
near Billings, since Oklohoma’s Con-
stitution limited him to one four-year
term. He is a candidate for the U. S.
Senate this year.

Long active in Oklahoma Republi-
can politics, Bellmon served one term
in the state’s House of Representatives
in 1946-48 and directed the Nixon-
for-President campaign there in 1960.

Macon And W&L
Sponsor Seminar
On ‘War and Peace’

Students from Randolph-Macon
Women’s College and W&L will meet
on intelectual grounds next semester,
when a new extra-curricular seminar
group gets under way in February
aS an experiment in co-education.

“An Anatomy of War and Peace
an objective investigation of the phe-
nomena of peace and war as they
influence the arts, science, politics,
religion, and other aspects of human
thought and action—has been chosen
as the general topic for the seminar.

The group, containing about 10 stu-
dents from each school, is expected
to meet twice a month for four
months, with the place of meeting
alternating between to two campuses.

At each meeting, a professor from
the host school will present a talk
illustrating some of the influences of
war and peace. Afterwards, the sub
ject will be thrown open for dis
cussion by the participants in the
seminar.

 

The idea originated at Randolph-
Macon, where a number of students
expressed the feeling that an occas
ional male opinion might be valu-
able for students at an all-women’s
school—and vice-versa. The project
and topic were drawn up by the
student curriculum committee there

The program being sponsored

on the W&L side by Phi Eta Sigma,
freshman scholastic honorary society,
in cooperation with the IFC

Mike Dunn, president of the Phi
Eta Sigma, has announced there are
still openings for interested students
from WAL, particularly those whose
interests lie largely in science, philso-
phy and religion, and other non
political fields. Persons who wish to
join should contact Dunn at 453- 4726.

able only of “participation” and not
“complete autonomy.”

The final segment of the student
revolt Atwood called “destructive.”
Some radicals, he said, would prefer
“academies for revolutionaries,” with-
out grades, classes, or education, but
this movement is “going to pot.” He
encouraged students to make them-
selves felt through peaceful, orderly
means,

Atwood turned his attention to the
seeming lack of student activists at
W&L. The reason, he felt, is that
while students across the country are
demanding to be heard, “at W&L they
are listened to.” Even in the area
of academic affairs, student opinions
are always considered, if not always
heeded. He cited the Student Cir-
riculum Committee as an example.

Finally, Atwood observed that the
activists are in an exciting position,
but the question is whether they will
have the “stamina” to bring change
if they get the power they desire.

Generals Annex Eleventh

(Continued from page 1)

Tonight the Generals face a very
tough team from Mars Hill College.
Though relatively unknown, Mars
Hill boasts a fine squad that has
beaten Lenoir Rhyne, a team which
beat W&L in a pre-season scrim-
mage by more than thirty points.
Like many of the teams on the W&L
schedule, Mars Hill is a run-and-
shoot club. The difference is that they
may be a little bit better than the
others,

The Generals
have won. their

are
last

-}| games, However, they must face one

of their stiffer tests of the season
with Earl Edwards, Stu Fauber and
Norwood Morrison all out with the
flu. Whether they will play remains
in doubt, and there is no question
that a lack of depth could hurt the
Generals. Mars Hill should provide
a difficult test.

‘Luke’ Stirs
Egg Craze

In the °20’s and °30’s it was eat-
ing goldfish. In the °40’s and °50’s it
was stuffing people into telephone
booths. And now, inspired by that
feat of feats performed by Paul
“Cool Hand Luke” Newman, the
present rage (at least in rageful Lex-
ington) is eating hard boiled eggs.

Organized by Mike “The Greek”
Miles, local bookmaker and reputed
Cosa Nostra head, a contest will be
held the first week after exams, pitting
Gordon “Gut” Findlay, Kappa Sig
sophomore from Kerrville, Texas
against an unknown ZBT representa-
tive, Art “The Hebe” Loring.

Mike The Greek has informed us
that rules established in the movie
“Cool Hand Luke” will apply in this
contest, i.e., eggs must be hard-boiled,
may be peeled and fed to contestants,
and must be wholly swallowed within
the given time period to count as a
fully eaten egg, the time period being
one hour. A contestant who blows
lunch (or breakfast, as the case may
be) will be disqualified.

Although it is doubted that either
contestant will match Luke’s gastro-
nomical performance of fifty eggs,
Miles has indicated that Findlay
should be able to engorge at least
thirty-five.

The contest will be held in the
Kappa Sig house. Admission will be
one dollar, and this price will include
one beer. More beer will be avail-
able. Betting will be set up on the
paramutual system, as determined by
members of the W&L math depart-
ment. The admission fee will help
cover the costs of Alka-Seltzer, Pepto-
Bismal, rug-cleaning and disinfecting,
and a stipend to the contestants,

Co-captain Bobby Paine returned
to his winning ways in the 152-pound
class by beating Paul Zook, 6-1. In
the 160-pound class Jack Ross was
again successful, defeating Neal
Shantz, 11-5. At the conclusion of the
Ross bout WAL was down 13-11.

snow has fallen on Lexington since

after the 167-pound bout, as Dave
Higgins overpowered Tim Hoover,
8-1. Danny Webster recorded the

fastest pin of the season as he dis-
posed of his opponent in 1:18 of the
first period. The Eastern Mennonite
177-pounder never knew what hit him.

The WAL victory was cinched
when Dee Coppenhaver, another
fresmman wrestling in his first varsity
meet, easily defeated Vernon Meyers,
6-0, in the 191-pound bout.

Unfortunately for heavyweight Jay
Clarke, his opponent turned out to
be the Mennonite’s captain and best
wrestler, Clarke was pinned for the
first time this season in 1:40 of the
second period,

WAL will again attempt to even its
record at 4-4 against a strong North
Carolina State squad on February 10.

The “E’s” and the Zebes have
come to a mutual agreement.

Letter to the Editor

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

Il, too, being aware of the weighty
moral responsibility of a W&L gentle-
man, must state my serious concern
with the traditional standard of con-
ventional dress.

To encourage compliance to this
most critical standard, and defend
our hallowed and revered heritage
from the crass, boorish like of Mr.
Dunbar (as small a minority as this
element of unrefined vulgarity may
be on this beautiful campus notwith-
standing), | must humbly and urgently
suggest that Gold Stars be awarded
to those students who consistently ful-
fill the sacred obligation to beclothe
themselves decorously, and that these
students, at the occasion of their
graduation, wear a set of Mickey
Mouse ears with five blue and white
stars and a tassel, in lieu of the
mortarboard.

Gentlemen, creeping barbarism is
upon our very doorstep, threatening

to bury us beneath the bulk of the|]-

ill-bred, unpolished masses!

It may already be too late, but
the effort must be made, for the
sake of those gentlemen who went
before us and are now vigilantly
watching from the great campus in
the sky, to repel the advances of
the slovenly herd.

If this struggle is successful here,

Serving Food and Beverages

it may bring about a sartorial re-
awakening among American students,
catapaulting W&L into its celestial
spot in the top ranks of first grade
education as the savior of Ameri-
ca’s corrupted six-year-olds.
Most urgently,
Douglas R. Engle, 69
