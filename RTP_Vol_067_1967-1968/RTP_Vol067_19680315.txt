Current Troubadour Production

‘Country Wife’ Is A Handbook

By KIRK WOODWARD

University theater becomes more
and more radical. Yale does a play
on Vietnam. Hollins stages Albee.
Now the Troubadours are presenting
a topical play, “The Country Wife,”
by Mr. Wycherly. Topical? Try think-
ing of it as a handbook.

Say you want to sleep with as
many women as possible, as Horner
does. You have two main obstacles:
husbands and logistics. The women
themselves aren't obstacles. However,
they need a good opportunity.

Study the weaknesses of your op-
ponents. Often they will do the work
for you. If a man like Pinchwife
marries an ignorant girl from the
country (Margery), hoping she won't
have brains enough to cuckold him,
His compulsion for security may end
up driving her out of the house.
Wait. Remember also that ignorance

Sometimes a husband may be hard-

to encourage others to reflect upon the

The Right And The Left

Conservative, n. A statesman who is enamored of exist-
ing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to
replace them with others.

—Ambrose Bierce

Many have said that conservatives oppose change. This
is absolutely untrue. They would not oppose a change to
more conservatism .... A liberal is much like a maiden
aunt. Always so interested in other people’s affairs and
wanting so much to help.

—Ring-tum Phi
Columnist, 1966
* * *

We highly recommend the above definitions to the atten-
tion of our readers. At W&L, not to know the meaning of
“conservative” and “liberal” may leave you hopelessly out of
the action in any discussion of What’s Wrong With Us. The
very words breathe battle on this campus.

“Conservative,” for example, raises visions of choking
neckties and choking indifference, grimaces of greeting on the
colonnade, and happy hedonism, starched shirts, and starched
minds; all vaguely attached to simple-minded Southerners.
If you happen to be of a political turn of mind, “conservative”
hints at hawkishness and humbug.

“Liberal,” of course, summons up a spectre with flowing
locks, turtleneck, and truly unbearable arrogance, spouting
warmed-over intellectuality through aggressively bearded lips.
Politically, liberals are better-red-than-dead doves with no re-
spect for constituted authority.

We were overjoyed, therefore, to observe that the last
few issue of both editions of the Ring-tum Phi have been filled
with the cries of conservatives and liberals, treating us to de-
lightfully doctrinaire broadsides from the Left (“Our con-
servative Southerner is incapable of tolerating anyone who is
liberal, creative, artistic, or philosophical”) and from the Right
(Anti-Conservative Students Reveal Personal Intolerance’’) .
And since Spring traditionally brings out the activist in many
an otherwise mild-mannered student, we have room to hope
that the verbal barrage will continue.

We could wish, however, that the spectacle was as mean-
ingful as it is entertaining. While the epithets “liberal” and
“conservative” fly, it seems to have occurred to no one that
real liberals and conservatives are as rare at W&L as they
are everywhere else, and that the vast majority of people who
find themselves classified as one or the other here really don’t
want or deserve either label. The real fact is that students
here have “liberal” ideas about some things and “conservative”
ideas about others; and by no means is everyone “liberal” or
“conservative” about the same things.

You’d never know it, or hear the armed camps talk. As
if every day and every trifling issue has brought us to the
Last Judgement, we have fallen into the habit of casting one
another into eternal damnation or salvation on the right or
left. In order to do this, we’ve evolved a truly marvelous yard-
stick. Coats and ties are “conservative.” Bushy beards are
“liberal.” Intellectualism is strictly liberal. Anti-intellectualism
is confined to conservatives. Southerners are conservative (So
we must also assume everyone else is liberal) . Fraternity parties
are downright reactionary, while sit-ins are hopelessly radical.
Conservatives like things to stay the way they are. Ninety-eight
per cent of the student body favors the coat and tie tradition.
Therefore, the campus is crawling with conservatives. Liberals
like to change things. Every student who wants exams before
Christmas, a freer exam schedule, no Saturday classes, more
liberal academic requirements, girls in dorms, better dorms,

better entertainment facilities, a better gym, a better theater, |

etc., etc., is a liberal. Therefore, the campus is crawling with

liberals. Q.E.D.

Can a more ridiculous edifice of cliche-ridden prejudices
be found anywhere? Hardly. Whatever value the terms “‘lib-
eral’ and “conservative” once had on this campus (and it
must have been small from the start), it has long since dis-
appeared, Everyday human idiosyncrasy simply defies the
clumsy liberal-conservative categories we seem to love so much

here.

Conflict and criticism are basic to progress, to be sure,
and they deserve their place in campus life—but please, let’s
here no more about liberals and conservatives.

Twelve nominees and six ballots...

 

By PAT AREY

“With these twelve candidates in
the field, there is still a possibility
that some dark horse will be nomi-
nated...”

So opened the official convention
journal of the first Mock Republican
Convention held at W&L. In 1916,
twelve persons were nominated be-
fore a convention that would run
for six ballots, and nearly be wrong
for the second time.

The prominent candidates for the
nomination were former President
Theodore Roosevelt, Supreme Court
Justice Charles Evans Hughes, and
Elihu Root of New York. The fav-
orite sons included Charles Fairbanks
of Indiana, Robert M. LaFollette,
Sen. L. Y. Sherman of Illinois, Sen.
William Borah of Idaho, Sen, Albert
Cummins of lowa, Sen. John Weeks
of Massachussetts, Gov. Hadley of
Missouri and Theodore Burton of
Ohio.

The GOP even had its peace candi-
date that year, Henry Ford of Detroit.

Sen. Weeks led the pre-convention
favorite sons. His banner was hung
over the commons and enthusiasm
for the senator culminated in an
“outburst” in the Lyric Theatre.

LaFollette was being pushed by
members of the Law School and the
author’s grandfather under the slogan
“Progressive but not radical.”

 

Charles Evans Hughes
“Wilson rose from the dead...”

Right With Hughes

 

“At the Lees Dormitory,” reported
the convention journal “the sonorous
battle cry ‘Root for Root’ has been
sounded, even at late hours of the
night.”

“Grape Juice Followers”

The two major platform issues of ki
the year were woman suffrage and
national prohibition of demon rum.
The Alabama delegation was report-
ed “Inclined to scoff at the idea of
national prohibition.”

Kentucky, on the other hand, was
reported ten to one opposed to giv-
ing the vote to the weaker sex. Said
the delegation’s banner: “Kentucky.
Good Liquor Needs No Prohibition.
Pretty Girls Don’t Care To Vote.”

Needless to say, the suffrage plank
was stricken from the platform. “Na-
tional prohibition did not even get as
much consideration . . . the grape
juice followers got a scanty vote.”

Much in the spirit of the conven-
tion, the Arizona delegation staged a
“mock” fracas for the sergeant-at-
arms.

The first ballot held no surprises.
No one came close to leading in the
ballot, with 87 votes for Root, and
75 for Hughes. Other votes were
Weeks, 47; Roosevelt, 41; Borah, 37;
LaFollette, 30; Cummins, 29; Sher-
man, 26; Fairbanks, 24; Burton, 20;
and Tender, 1.

On the second ballot, Sen. Cum-
mins came to the front with 133 votes,
far ahead of Root, who fell to 76.
Hughes had 70 votes; Roosevelt, 66;
Weeks, 44; LaFollette, 21; Borah, 15;
and peace candidate Ford, 11.

LaFollette Doublecrossed

With the third ballot coming up.
the Root and LaFollette forces made
a deal. LaFollette’s votes to Root on

12 votes, then none when the Root
forces refused to deliver the promised
support. Burton held with three votes,
and the second ballot leader was left
with one lone supporter of a previous
133.

After some rather frantic backroom
dealing and bickering, Ohio’s Burton
enjoyed a brief moment of glory,
jumping from a mere three en-
thusiasts to 154 votes. Hughes, how-
ever, kept his fat lead of 175 votes.
Root held only 92 votes, Roosevelt
dipped to 38, and Sen. Borah fol-
lowed the lead of Sen. Cummins to
inglorious oblivion, despite one lonely
stalwart supporter, Needless to say,
“Fighting Bob” LaFollette had had
the screws put to him.

The fifth ballot nearly saw a Roose-
velt sweep. States began to shift
to T. R., but not quite enough;
he was stopped some 30 votes short
of the nomination,

Roosevelt had captured 196 dele-
gates; Root had jumped to 181, and
Justice Hughes was left with a paltry
40 votes.

 

In 1916 Convention

“This slump by Hughes was a mere
lull preceding that proverbial storm,”
said the convention journal.

On the sixth and final ballot, the
race resolved into fiight between
Hughes and Roosevelt.

On the roll call, Alabama opened
for Roosevelt, Arizona then cast its
three votes for Hughes. Arkansas, in
turn, went for the Man With a Big
Stick. But then followed a solid string
of votes for Hughes, with a few inter-
jections for T. R.

The sixth ballot declared Hughes
the nominee, with 309 votes against
Roosevelt’s 157.

Wasting no time, the convention
endorsed without opposition Sen.
Miles Poindexter of Washington for
vice president. Poindexter, true to
W&L tradition and spirit, was an
alumnus of the college.

Once again, W&L correctly forecast
the nominee of the real national con-
vention. And the GOP went on to
grasp defeat from the jaws of victory
that November.

The third ballot saw a boom for
Sen. Borah. The Idaho senator's votes
shot up from 15 to 115. But Hughes
led the count with 167 votes. Root
moved up to 92 votes; Roosevelt de-

clined to 56; LaFollette was left with By BOS ENTZMINGER

Freshman E, C, Representative

Last week, on the basis of inter-
views | had held with over 100 fresh-
men, I presented my classmates’ opin-
ions concerning Washington and Lee’s
traditons and its system of operation.
This week, I shall attempt to give the
freshman views on certain specific
features of the W&L campus which
are now in existence or may be in
existence in the near future. Although
it is impossible to give completely the
opinion of every individual inter-
viewed, I feel that the most emphasiz-
ed ideas are indicative of the feeling
of the majority o fthe freshmen.

Q. Do you think our library is
adequate?
Yes No

Of those who answered “no” to the
above question, a large percentage
cited examples of times when they
had not been able to obtain necessary
material in our library. When asked,

dates for the Republican Presidential
nomination seem to be divisible into
two groups: Richard Nixon, and the
rest.

Just hours before the results of the
New Hampshire primary had confirm-
ed this categorization on the national
level, activities of various Mock Con-
vention campaign committees had
established that impression here.

The Nixon forces, with law student
Chip Day in charge, had planned a

reply, meaning more new books and
a more diversified selection of books
on various subjects. The difficulty of
acquiring adequate research books
when preparing a theme or paper had
already been experienced by some
freshmen.

Longer hours for studying in the
library was another suggestion off-
ered. Many people would like to see
the library opened earlier on Sunday,
either early in the afternoon or late
in the morning. Also, it was the
opinion of many that the library
should remain open longer at night
during exam period. Students felt that
there was not enough space in class-
rooms and other libraries on campus
for those who wished to study past

Some type of orientation to the
library besides the written explanation
passed out in English classes was the
request of many freshmen, Some did
not know what study areas were
available in different parts of the
library or where some of the books
were located. A brief tour of the
library for freshmen was suggested
as a solution to this problem.

Dear Sit

everything that goes on on campus

more donations from state delega-
tions which support Nixon. Nixon or-
organizations elsewhere are also con-
tributing, but more funds will be
needed. Even though they are going
through the pre-convention motions
(they opened a headquarters Wednes-
day), they are already forming
strategy for the Mock Convention
proper (planning their own platform
proposal, demonstrations, and a nom-
inating speech). It is clear that they
intend to be discreet, hoping to keep
delegates aware of Nixon, but stop-
ping far short of the saturation
point. As Day puts it, “Right now, we
just want to make sure the delega-
tions vote as they should.”

Of those classed as “others,” Gov.
Nelson Rockfeller seems to be the
front-runner, even if his showing in
New Hampshire is not encouraging.
His campaign committee here, hamp-
ered by his refusal to announce, ex-
hibits something of the same im-
promptu organization as its counter-
part in New Hampshire. Headed by
Pat Arey, they are working hard to
overcome Nixon's lead in the mind of
the WAL student by a variety of
posters and informational materials.
Yet lack of funds (there was some
jealous muttering about the amount
of money raised by Reagan sup-
porters) and the opinion that they
should do nothing more than “be
ready” in case Rockefeller decides
to act like the candidate everybody
says he is has confined their scope
of action to the immediate future.
But they are hoping, and from their
bare room above Rose's Store they
dash in and out, planning polls to
test public sentiment in the coming
weeks. That one must remain flexible,
however, is a prime political axiom,
That they realize that need is at-
tested to by a Eugene McCarthy pos-
ter which is covering the peeling
paint along one wall,

If Sen. Charles Percy of Hlinois is
more adamant than Rockefeller in
his non-candidacy (“I'm running for
nothing”), at least his advocates here
are more organized, And if the size
of their office (embarrassingly close

| to that of Rockefeller’s forces) is any

indication, they are in a substaniial-
ly higher income bracket, too

Friday Sports Columnist

This time of year, every sports
columnist worth his salt is predict-
ing either the upcoming pennant races
or the basketball tournaments of the
next two weekends. Jumping boldly
on the bandwagon, “Thunder's Theor-
ies” will examine the NCAA regionals
in an attempt to raise my percentage
in the risky world of prognostication.

The regionals this year seem to
indicate clear-cut winners in three of
the four sections. The only one of the
four that raises any doubt is the
Eastern region, which should be the
most interesting of the four.

Lions and Wildcats

In the East, Columbia (22-4), the
Ivy League victor, will square off
against Southern Conference king
Davidson (23-4). Columbia has three
solid performers in seven-footer Dave
Newmark, Heyward Dotson, and Jim
McMillan. All can score in the twen-
ties, and they won a big one over
a good Princeton club to get into
the tournament.

However, there is one big ques-
tion; Newmark is suffering from an
injury that will cut his ability to
handle Davidson’s big Mike Maloy.
In addition, the Wildcats’ strong
backcourt of Wayne Huckel and
Dave Moser, plus Rodney Knowles,
a strong substitute who might be
called on to give Newmark some op-
position under the boards, gains my
nod to the North Carolinians.

Bonnies and Tarheels

The second game of this region
should be one of the biggest of the
tournament, as North Carolina will
meet undefeated St. Bonaventure and
its two siege guns, Bob Lanier and
Bill Butler.

I think the Tarheels have a couple
of things going for them that should
net them a victory. Number one, or
course,, is Larry Miller, who will
help not only because he is an out-
standing star in his own right, but
because he wants to go out a winner,
and when a man of his stature tells
his teammates to win, few will dis-
pute his words. His inspiration should
prod big Rusty Clark to an adequate
effort against Lanier, and that battle
should go a long way to deciding a
winner. The difference should be that
Clark will have the help of four
tourney-wise teammates who operate
as a well-tuned machine with Mr.
Miller at the controls. It looks like the
Tarheels in a close one.

In the final, a Davidson-UNC game
would be equal to the Tarheel-St.
Bonaventure encounter for exicite-
ment. On the other hand, Columbia
would probably be blown off the floor
by either UNC or the Bonnies,
especially if Newmark should compli-
cate his injury. However, I see the
two Carolina schools meeting in an
intrastate grudge match, with the
Chapel Hill squad the winer, once

again because of the fact that David-
son doesn't have an individual to hold
Miller, while Clark’s height advant-
age might slow down the Wildcat star,
Maloy.

‘Cats ’n Cougars

In the other regions, Kentucky
looks like a shoo-in in the Mideast
with their only trouble coming from
Marquette. Coach Adolph Rupp’s
super-stable of sophomores Casey,
Pratt, and Issel should be more than
enough.

In the Midwest, it’s the Cougars of
Houston in a breeze, although some
would point to Louisville with the
upset in mind. The Kentuckians
though need an Indian to keep their
chiefs like Wes Unseld, Butch Beard,
and Mike Grosso in line. Even with
George Reynolds out because of the
junior college inelibility rule, the Big
E should be up high enough for
another final. Either TCU or Kansas
State (with a total of 17 losses between
them) is no more than cannon
fodder.

On the coast, the Bruins of Johnny
Wooden feel they have a date with
destiny, and New Mexico State (22-5)
and New Mexico (23-3) should be
the victims.

For a closing shot, although for
the time being I see no reason to
extend my neck farther this week,
here’s a hint for followers of early
round NIT play: don't be surprised
if the number one seed, Duke, falls
before its date with the finals.

Fifteen Golfers Vie
For Team Positions

Five lettermen out of an aggrega-
tion of fifteen hopefuls are currently
battling for the ten spots on the 1968
edition of Cy Twombly’s Washington
and Lee golf team.

Practice opened this week for the
Generals on the Luxurious Lexing-
ton Links, which, according to
Twombly, are not in their finest
condition (as if many things in this
fair city ever are). Practice scores
have been high, but Twombly says
he expects them to begin dropping
once the course starts shaping up.

Returning Strength

Captain Bob Mathews leads the
returning lettermen, a group com-
posed of himself, juniors Bill McLeod
and Gary Silverfield, and sophomores
Dick Singletary and Dave Parker.
Mathews, McLeod, and Singletary
have posted the lowest pratice scores
so far, but the Richmond captain has
been hampered somewhat by a bad
back. “If his back improves,” Twomb-
ly commented, “he should have a
fine season.”

Rounding out the list of prospects
for what Twombly said should be
a “well balanced” squad are fresh-
men Ken Carter, John Gunner, John
Bowie, and Jim Gordon; junior Tom

Lacrosse For The § pectator

Lacrosse is one of the few sports native to North America and
one of the oldest intercollegiate sports in the United States. The game
was discovered by missionaries among the Canadian Indians, and was
developed in the United States mainly on the East coast in the Maryland
area. But now the popularity of the game is spreading and teams
and leagues are being formed all the way to the West coast.

Basically, a lacrosse team is composed of ten players: 3 attack-
men, 3 defensemen, 3 midfielders, and a goalie. The game is played
on a field 110 yards long and from 60 to 70 yards wide. The goals are
80 yards apart and are located in a ten-foot diameter circle called the
crease. No offensive player is allowed to enter the crease or to interere
with the goalie while he has posssession of the ball in the crease.

The field is divided in half by the midfield line, and each half is
split by a restraining line. These restraining lines are used only when
the ball is put in play, or faced off, after each goal or at the beginning
of each quarter. At this time the attack and defensive players on each
half of the field must stay behind their respective restraining lines
until a midfielder gains possession of the ball, or until the ball crosses
their restraining line.

At all times each team must have three attackmen and four
defensemen on their respective sides of the midfield lines. The mid-
fielders, however, are permitted to cover any part of the field, and
may release an attackman or defenseman by remaining on that player's
half of the field.

The game is played by controlling the hard rubber ball in the
net of a stick and moving the play of the game either by running with
the ball or passing it to another player. The goalie is the only player
allowed to touch the ball with his hands, but any player may kick the
ball.

A goal is scored when the attacking team gets the ball into the
six foot square “cage.” This is accomplished with basic plays and
variations similar to basketball, that is cutting and picking a man off
or a One-on-one situation.

Blocking and checking are also permitted, with the blocking rules
much the same as those in football. A player is not allowed to block
an Opponent unless that player has control of the ball or he is within
five yards of the ball when it is not controlled by another player. A
blocking player must have both hands on his stick and may not block
the player from behind or below the knees.

A check is delivered with the stick itself, and is used to dislodge
the ball from another player's stick or to prevent another player from
gaining possession of the ball. Only the stick or gloves of an opponent
may be checked, but sometimes the action gets out of hand with some
brutal results, which is one reason for the growing spectator appeal
among the sadistic thrill seekers around the country.

For infractions of the rules a player is asked to sit in the penalty
box, 30 seconds for a technical foul, 60 seconds for a personal foul,
and up to three minutes for the more serious infractions. The player
is allowed to return to the field when a goal is scored against his
team or when his penalty is expired. Until that time his team must
play a man down.

The most common technical fouls are off sides, a moving pick, or
being in the crease. Personal fouls are charged for illegal checks, block-
ing from behind, tripping, or bad-mouthing the ref

In all lacrosse is a combination of many athletic talents such as
found in football, basketball, soccer, and ice hockey, and with that
mixture One comes out with the fastest game on two feet, lacrosse.

« Neer Holds Attention

As Tracksters Prep

By ROY CARLTON

Next Tuesday at 3:45, the Wash-
ington and Lee track team will open
its season against Richmond, here on
Wilson Field. While the meet should
be interesting of its own account, it
will also mark the debut of W&L’s
Mike Neer as a trackman.

Records May Fall

Coach Lee McLaughlin is enthusi-
astic about Neer’s potential and has
called him “the first really quality
trackman we've had here in a long
time.” He’s almost certain of break-
ing the school record in the high
jump.” The record was set in 1963
by R. A. Kell at 61”, but Neer has
already jumped 64” in an indoor
meet and has been jumping 66” in
practice. Not only is he an excellent
high jumper, but he’s also a fine
triple jumper with a solid chance of
breaking the school record in that

event,
x

This year’s team has its main
strength in the distance events. Bob
Stack is the number one miler, but
he’s a doubtful prospect for Tuesday's
meet, due to a bout with the flu.
Backing him up is Harry Zeliff. Cor-
bett Bryant also looks good in the
two-mile event. Earl Edwards has
been coming along very well also, and

may be able to dent the school’s mile
record toward the end of the season.

Phil Norwood, this year‘s captain,
is the team’s best sprinter and will
probably anchor the 440 relay team,
as he’s the only returning member of
last year’s unit.

Partly also, we normally like being

(as nice a euphemism as was ever
studied in freshman English).

The statement that, “Those who
successfully complete the program
will have a better understanding of
what the Army is all about [suggest-
ing we do not know already] and an
increased capability of handling prob-
lems that arise both inside and out-
side the Army,” implies that the type
of training the Army provides will
even help people better understand
themselves and society. This is a nice
statement of the goals of a small
liberal arts university, but rings slight-
ly flat when set up as the objective
of a Ranger program.

I feel it necessary to maintain an
army in “modern society” (if that
is not a euphemism also). However,
if a “peacetime army,” such as the
military technically is in our present
state of undeclared war, is so readily
available for such field exercises as
those currently being conducted in
Southeast Asia, | have to ask why we
need Ranger programs to occupy the
time of undergraduates.

It is possible of course, that the
U.S. is “waging peace” (Hubert Hum-
phrey) in Vietnam. In that case, I
can understand why a dinner dance
with presentation of black beret,
ranger tags, and a Ranger trophy is
a refined and gentlemanly conclusion
to training which “will vary from
bayonet training and guerrilla war-
fare to first aid and survival train-
ing.”

My only question is why not have
a special Ranger decoder ring with
secret compartment?

the opposition of a number of fresh-
men,

Q. Would you favor compulsory
dorms for anyone other than fresh-
men?

Yes Ne
Il per cent 89 per-cent

The main objection again was the
loss of the option of the student to
live where he wished, However, most
freshmen felt that new dorms should
be built if the present ones aren't
able to accommodate those upperclass-
men wishing to live in them.

The following question was the sub-
ject of much discussion among those
interviewed and the responses given
are noteworthy,

Q. Of the buildings which need

to be constructed on campus, which
do you think should be given first
preference? Which should be given
second preference?
This question was asked on the sup-
position that construction on the new
student union building had not been
started. Therefore, a new student
union building could be included in
this answer,

First prefernce:

Gymnasium 48 per cent
Auditorium 28 per cent
Library 17 per cent
Student Union 7 per cent
Second preference:

Auditorium 36 per cent
Gymnasium 33 per cent
Library 28 per cent
Student Union 2 per cent

New Dorms I per cent

The idea of a field-house, which
could serve as both a gymnasium and
auditorium, was suggested by several
freshmen. It seems significant that the
great majority of freshmen felt that
a new gym, new auditorium, or new
library should have preference over
a new student union, The problem
with the construction of any of these
buildings is the raising of funds, which
freshmen are aware of, as | mentioned
last week, Most students felt that
the money could be raised, however,
if given a sustained effort by the ad-
ministration

Q. Do you think basketball or

 

sidized here?

color films of his research.

What The Class Of 1971 Is Thinking

Yes No
41 per cent 59 per cent

Opinion on this question was very
split, with the “yes” voters arguing
that the money spent on subsidization
would be worth the prestige that the
school would receive in return, while
the “no” voters felt that subsidization
would lower the academic standards
of the school and would be a waste of
money. Most of those who were in
favor of subsidization thought that
basketball should be the sport sub-
sidized with the others favoring foot-
ball.

This completes my report on the
results of my interviews with my fel-
low freshmen. Is is very difficult to
combine the thoughts that were ex-
pressed during these sessions into one
specific mode of thinking. However,
one general attitude does seem pre-
valent. Freshmen are very strongly in
favor of the conservation of certain
traditions here at WAL. They feel
that these traditions are invaluable.
However, they would rather see our
campus characterized by an air of
progressiveness than by the stench of
stagnation. They realize that nothing
can live on its past reputation, its past
fame. Instead, everything must be
judged on what it is doing in the
present, Any significant advancement
brought about on this campus can-
not be accomplished by one man, one
committee, or one Organization. More-
over, it must be done through the
combined effort of all those involved.
Only through constant concern and
self-examination can we be sure that
the path we are following is not one
of indifferent retrogression but instead,
one of sound progress.

wait for the final decision of their
candidate.

Only Nixon’s supporters are in a
position which might be called favor-
able, and they appear ready to utilize
that position both skillfully and with
discretion. That the other commit-
tees recognize Nixon’s enviable posi-
tion and their own similarities is
shown by the interchange of person-
nel among these groups. This inter-
change may reflect a growing need
for compromise in the convention, (a
compromise which may be develop-
ing nationally, too) and that need
may produce a more equitable, and
perhaps very different, vote distribu-
tion than occurred in the New Hamp-
shire primary.

Neer Holds Attention

however, the team’s best strength lies
in the shotput, where the Generals are
blessed with an over-abundance of
good material. Phil Jones returns this
year to take a crack at the school
mark of 48'9", but he’s also supported
by a pair of excellent freshmen in
Chris Friend and Doug Deaton, who
also runs the hurdles,

The team does have a_ serious
weakness in the pole vault. Coaches
Miller and McLaughlin are both look-

Field, but may have to be played
on the intramural field where the
club now practices.

The problem may be solved by the
acquisition of playing rights on a field
near the Buffalo Creek Pavilion. That
is the spot which the club hopes to
use for the Springs Weekend tourna-
ment and the remainder of its home
games. Unlike fields on the W&L
campus, this one has no restrictions
regading that integral part of any
rugby match, the keg party after the
game.

Earns Respect

Despite its somewhat meager status
around Washington and Lee, the club
is well respected in area rugby circles.
This is evidenced by the many re-
quests its receives to enter tourna-
ments and play other clubs. Un-
fortunately, due to the lack of funds,
the club is limited in regard to its
travel budget. Hopefully, with the help
of donations from the merchants and
students that comprise the unfficial
“Friends of the Rugby Club,” the
organization will be able to surmount
its financial problems and become a
set part of the University.
