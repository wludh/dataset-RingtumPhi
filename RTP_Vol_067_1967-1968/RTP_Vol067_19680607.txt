By JAY PASSAVANT
Student Body President

In anything of significance that a
person undertakes, he should strive to
establish sound foundations and make

adequate — prepera-
tions before em-
barking on his

task. An education
at Washington and
Lee is no exception
to this rule and
what is more, ade-
quate preparation
(other than aca-
demics) is almost
essential to a
smooth  assimila-
tion into W&L
life. Every year, many confused and
uninformed freshmen stumble around
the campus for several months learn-

ing the general operation of various |

organizations and details of our
honored traditions as they go.
Often they unknowingly miss op-

portunities for involvement in W&L
life which are numerous during the
early part of the year and occas-
sionally their ignorance even leads to
embarrassment as they commit a
violation or break a rule that they
perhaps knew nothing about.
Unfortunately, there is no excuse
for such stumbling on the part of the
freshman. The faculty, administration,
and student government make an al-
most superhuman effort to provide
incoming students with important in-
formation during the summer prior
to their arrival and then most in-
tensively at freshman camp immedi-
ately before classes begin. However,
too many freshmen only glance at the
literature they receive during the
summer tossing it aside, and then pro-
ceed to freshman camp only to sleep

$60,000 Ford grant

Washington and Lee University
| has received a $60,000 matching grant
| from the Ford Foundation under the
|foundation’s national program to
assist humanities at four-year-liberal
arts colleges.

The University is one of 61 lead-
ing colleges sharing in the $2.7 mil-
lion program announced by the Ford
Foundation. Two other Virginia col-
leges also were awarded grants: Holl-
ins receiving $50,000 and Randolph-
Macon Woman's College $30,000.

The grants are contingent upon their
being matched by the recipients.
Washington and Lee will use the
resulting $120,000 to initiate a pro-

gram of leaves-of-absence for its
humanities professors.
Washingion and Lee University

 

President Robert E. R. Huntley com-
| mented that the Ford Foundation pro-
| gram “is of particular significance
| because it is directed at a need which
| will be of critical importance in the
| future of the liberal arts college.

| “We are grateful that the Founda-

Jarret, Crenshaw on leave

iwo Washington and Lee history
professors, Dr. Marshall Jarrett and

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw, will be on
leave during the 1968-69 academic
year under a program established

through the Ford Foundation grant
announced last week.

Dr. Jarrett will be on leave dur-
ing the first semester, and Dr. Cren-
shaw the second semester. In_ their
absence, their courses will be taught
by instructor Paul K. Beebee, who
replaced Dr. William A. Jenks while
the latter was on leave this year.

Plans also are being formulated to
permit two professors in the depart-
ment of religion and two in the fine
arts department to take leaves next
year (one each semester in each de-
partment). This would make a total
of six professors—three each semes-
ter—on leave during the 1968-69 year.

Under the program, each W&L
professor on leave will continue to
receive his University salary, and the
new program funds will be used to
secure his replacement.

Dr. Jarrett will carry on his con-
tinuing research and writing on a
manuscript dealing with 18th century
French intellectual history. The study
deals with the 1751 “French Ency-
clopedia” as a vehicle for dissemina-

tion of liberal social and political

ideas, with emphasis on the en-
eyclopedia’s co-editors, Diderot and
D'Alembert.

Dr. Crenshaw's work entails re-
search for a book dealing in depth
with the background of the Seces-
sionist movement in South Carolina
in the 1850's and ‘60's. It will present
a political and social picture of South
Carolina in those days as well as in
antebellum Washington, D.C.

The first year, the Foundation will
provide $25,000, the University $5,-
second year, the Foundation
$20,000, WAL $10,000; third year,
the Foundation $10,000, the Univers-
ity $20,000; and the fourth year, the
Foundation $5,000, WAL $25,000

After four the University
will then continue the leaves-of-ab
program by assuming full fi
nancial responsibility for it

Of the 61 schools, only Dartmouth
($85,000) and Haverford ($80,000)
received a greater amount than WAl

Troubadours offer
lecture series, new
plays for next year

Plans are already well under way
at the Troubadour Theatre for next
year. Four plays have been selected:
officers for the upcoming season have
been elected; and innevations are be-
ing proposed.

Perhaps the most unusual of next
year’s productions is “America Hur-
rah!” by Van lItallie. Mr. Itallie’s
work consists of three one-act plays
held together by a common theme
satirizing American institutions. Each
of the three acts is separtely titled;
in order, these vignettes are called:
“The Interview,” “T.V.,.” and “Motel.”

“Exit the King” by lonesco is also
on the Troubadour Theaire’s slate for
next year. It deals with the problems
of man growing old and facing
death; “Exit the King” is, in Trouba-
dour Director Lee Kahn's opinion, a

To the entering freshmen

As rising freshmen, you are entering Washington and Lee
University perhaps at the time of its greatest flux. Our new,
dynamic president will be inaugurated next October and the
nation’s educational leaders will witness with you this Uni-
versity’s answer to the challenge of changing times. A soon-
to-be-announced development program will correct the struc-
tural flaws in some of our historic buildings, but, as its main
goal, will enhance the University’s ability totally to serve its
students. The faculty and administration have demonstrated
not only their winningness to respond to student requests; they,
too, have joined the vanguard in evaluating—and changing
where necessary—all aspects of student concern. Our fra-
ternity system, whose eighteen members will provide this Uni-
versity’s main social outlet at least until the new Student Union

is completed next Spring, is facing a dual dilemma of having

The class of 1972: the glowing future les unrolled

It all begins with a rush

 

to reform its hundred-year-old bidding system in the same
year when its idealistic rationale of brotherhood open to all
is being tested and scrutinized as never before.

You, the class of 1972, are in a unique position to observe
the inevitable changes as they begin and to shape the out-
come of most of them. We urge you to become involved in
some area open to rigorous student participation—there is no
dearth of opportunities; come to know hard-to-get-to-know
Lexington as we have, and enjoy it; take advantage of the fact
that at Washington and Lee you will be able to establish almost
a first-name-basis rapport with many your professors; study, to
be sure, but not so diligently that these four years of excite-
—L.H.

ment and nostalgia will pass too quickly.

 

The Ring-tum Phi—Tuesday

Che Ring-tum Phi is published Tuesdays and Fridays during the college
year. It is printed by the Journalism Laboratory Press, Washington and Lee
University. The mailing address is Box 899, Lexington, Virginia 24450.

Entered as second class matter September 29, 1946, at the Post Office,
Lexington, Virginia 24450, under the act of March 3, 1879.

A Message to the New Students

The traditions of Washington and Lee University require conven-
tional dress. Our shop, in keeping with these traditions, is designed
solely for the W &L man and features the natural
shoulder style prevailing on our campus.

The correct appearance of both “on and off” campus is so very im-
portant throughout the school year . . .

 

 

AND YOU CERTAINLY WANT TO LOOK YOUR BEST
DURING RUSH WEEK.

Our long experience with W&L men enables us to soundly advise

and fill all your complete clothing requirements in the beginning
and throughout the school year.

You, as a student of W&L, hold the priviledge of an open charge ac-

lems that you may have. You may be assured of our personal and

prompt attention to each and every inquiry made.
