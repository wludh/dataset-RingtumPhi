Physical, Academic Change
Marks 219th College Year

A new president, a new dean, two
new department heads and one new
building were on hand when Wash-
ington and Lee University opened
its 219th academic year Sept. 20,

A record 1,456 students—the first
time the University’s enrollment has
ever topped 1,400—began registering
Monday.

The new president is Dr. William
W. Pusey, HI, who has been named
acting president, effective Sept. 1,
until a new president is selected to
succeed Dr. Fred C. Cole. (See re-
lated story on page 2.) Dr. Cole,
Washington and Lee president since
1959, resigned to accept the presi-
dency of the Council on Library
Resources in Washington, D. C.

Ihe new dean is Robert E. R.
Huntley, who became dean of the
School of Law, on September | suc-

ceeding Charles P. Light, Jr. Dean
Light retired Aug, 21 as dean, but
remains professor of law and will
continue to teach full time.

The new department heads are Dr.
Emory Kimbrough, Jr., sociology,
and Lt. Col. Everett C. Royal, military
science.

Only Col. Royal will be a stranger
to the students. Dr. Pusey, a mem-
ber of the W&L faculty since 1930,
will continue in his present position
as Dean of the College, a post he
has held since 1960, Prof. Huntley,
a Washington and Lee alumnus,
joined the law faculty in 1958, and
Dr. Kimbrough began his W&L teach-
ing duties in 1962,

Col. Royal and his staff will occupy

the newest addition to the W&L
campus, a $70,000 steel-sided and

cinderblock structure which will house
the military department and also the

University’s building and grounds
offices.
The Reserved Officer's Training

Corps (ROTC) will occupy the entire
main floor of the building, which will
have nine offices or work rooms, two
classrooms and a training aids room.
The military department also will

use half of the basement for its arms
and uniform storage area, while build-
ings and grounds will use the other

 

half for its offices, a mailing room
and storage space.
New Innovations

Innovations for the students
rolling at Washington and Lee in-
clude a new grade system, a new
option to take certain courses on a
“pass-fail” basis, and possibly the last
of the traditional “early” rush weeks,
when fraternities seek new members
during the first week of school.

The new grade system is a switch
from the former 3.0 scale to a 4.0
scale in “grade-point ratios.” Students
will continue to receive letter grades,
A through F. The 4,0 system is in-
creasingly becoming standard at most
colleges and universities.

Beginning this year as a_ trial,
WAL juniors and seniors may take
one elective course each semester on
a “pass-fail” basis, where no letter
grade will be given. The system is
designed to encourage students to
undertake more difficult courses while
lessening the hazard of a low grade
pulling down their overall academic
average.

Washington and Lee's [8 social fra-
ternities completed their traditional
“rush” for new members this week,
but it may be the last time they will
do so before fall classes start. A
strongly-worded faculty resolution in
May requested the students to draw
up a plan of deferred rush to be
implemented in the Fail of 1968.
Under such a system, rushing prob-
ably would be deferred at least until
the end of the first semester.

fhe final figures of rush will be
released next week after freshmen
accept fraternity bids tonight between
8 and 10,

The expected record enrollment of
1,456 compares with last year's total
figure of 1,386, and includes 358 fresh-
men, 888 upperclassmen and 218 in
the School of Law. The biggest in-
crease (approximately 65) is in the
number of upperclassmen returning,
along with several more transfer and
foreign students. The law school and
freshmen figures are very close to last
year s.

Looking in Books Is
Breach of Honor Code

Prompted by several contro-
versial honor trials, the Executive
Committee last spring adopted the
policy of expelling any student
found looking into a book or note-
book during a test or exam, unless
it can be proved that he was not
cheating.

Student Body President Richard
Nash said that in past honor trial
cases, students have been caught
looking in books or notebooks,
but the EC has been unable to
prove definitely that the student
had received aid from them,

The proposal was passed by the
newly-elected EC in a planning
session last spring,

W&L Gets Federal Grant
For College Library Study

Washington and Lee University
received a grant of $75,000 this sum-
mer from the U. S. Office of Educa-
tion to study the impact of modern
technology on small college libraries.

The study, which will continue
through mid-December 1968, is aimed
at identifying the critical problems of
small college and community college
libraries and finding solutions to them
through efficient and economical ap-
plication of the latest technical inno-
vations and equipment.

Dr. Edward F. Turner, professor
of physics and head of the depart-
ment, is the principal investigator.
He is a member of the University’s
library committee and has been a
consultant on library problems to the
Ford Foundation. In this connection,
he has personally consulted with uni-
versity and public libraries, industrial

producers of library equipment and |

library researchers across the country.

The focus of the study will be on
building an optimum library for the
liberal arts college. Particular atten

tion will be given to the application |

of microfilm methods of storage and
to the use of computers to facilitate
access to the material. The ultimate

goal ts to improve overall service to 7

the library user.

Planned By Spring ’69

much more varied program of social
and recreational activities than at
present. Bids are now being asked
for the project, which entails com-
plete renovation of the present two-
story Student Union building and
erection of a new one-story structure
to link the Student Union with the
present Evans Dining Hall,

The expanded facility has been
made possible through two bequests
totaling more than $500,000, one
from Mrs. Annie Fielding Early of
Washington, D.C, and the other from
her daughter, Mrs. Annie Early Fair-
fax of Washington and Roanoke. Both
were friends and supporters of Wash-
ington and Lee for a number of years.

Many of the students’ extracur-
ricular and leisure activities will be
centered in the new structure when
it is completed in March, 1969, In-
cluded will be music rehearsal and
practice rooms, several meeting rooms
for the various student organizations,
a chapel and office for the University
chaplain, a large reception lounge, a
library and reading room, a tavern,
and rooms for television, billiards,
cards and ping pong.

The student body Executive Com-
mittee, which administers the student
government and the honor system,
also will have its meeting rooms in
the building.

The student center will be super-
vised by a director, a new position
to be filled at a later date. Space is
provided in the building for the di-
rector’s office.

The new structure will relieve a
pressing need to provide more and
better recreational and social facili-
ties for Washington and Lee students

A special student-faculty commit-
tee has been working for more than
a year planning what the building
would contain. Through polls and
discussions with the students, the com
mitiee sounded out their opinions
while working closely with Dean of
Students Edward C. Atwood, Jr. in
planning the new structure.

“Every consideration has been given
to providing, as far as practical, what
the students want in the way of a
student center,” Dean Atwood com-
mented,

The new facility was designed by

Nexsen & Owen of Lynchburg. A

THE RING-

TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Published by the Students of Washington and Lee
Friday, September 22, 1967

 

A Statement Of Policy

At various times in the past the Ring-tum Phi has been

accused of being inaccurate,

irreverent, and irresponsible;

biased, boring, and sensationalist; vulgar, unintellectual, and
downright trashy. As recently as last week the dean of students
told a crowd of freshmen at Freshman Camp that the Ring-tum
Phi is a “panic” publication put together in haste and inac-
curacy every Tuesday and Friday morning with whatever will
fill up four pages—and we suspect he was only half joking.

In fact, baiting the Ring-tum Phi seems to have become
as popular a faculty sport as handball (and more exciting,
since you never know when the Ring-tum Phi, unlike the

handball, will strike back.)

We have no intention of apologizing for ourselves and
our opinions. But it has been our observation that the articles
which bring the greatest number of complaints are those
written by columnists who are not reguarly affiliated with the
Ring-tum Phi staff. Such articles, for the benefit of freshmen
and professors new to W&L, usually consist of an opening
paragraph followed by 95 paragraphs on What’s Wrong With
WeL, and a concluding paragraph respectfully suggesting
the resignation of one or more presidents, deans, and assorted
student leaders. (We have frequently been accused of supply-
ing mimeographed, fill-in-the-blank forms for such opinion

pieces. This is quite untrue.)

In all seriousness, however, we feel that amid the monoton-
ous gray cloud of columns and letters to the editor there is
an occasional silver lining of intelligent and pertinent com-
ment, and that this comment should be encouraged to the full
as being one of the most basic functions of the Ring-tum Phi—
in spite of the various brickbats we may receive from some
quarters for doing so. We also feel that it is not the business
of our staff to judge what is intelligent and what is ridiculous
in this kind of article, leaving that to the readers’ individual

discretion and sense of humor.

With the above assumptions, we have established the
following policy with regard to the articles of opinion and
letters to the editor which appear on this page:

—All articles of opinion will be accepted for publication,

with the following reservations:

—Articles and letters to the editor must be signed, although
names may be withheld if requested.

—The Ring-tum Phi reserves the right to disassociate itself
from any opinions expressed in an article.

—Obscene or libelous material can not be accepted.

—Articles must be submitted well in advance of the de-

 

sired printing date.

21 New Faculty Members Added
As School Begins Fall Semester

Twenty-one new members have
been added to the faculty of Washing-
ton and Lee this fall including replace-
ments for professors on leave and
new additions.

The appointments include an as
sociate professor, two assistant pro-
fessors, 14 instructors, and four men
in the ROTC department, according
to Dr. W. W. Pusey, acting president.

A number of the instructors, Pusey

tion of their Ph.D. degrees.

Richard E. Szlasa, 31, instructor in
physical education, is the new lacrosse
coach replacing Dana Swan who fe-
signed to become football coach at
Haverford College. Szlasa, formerly

Dean Hotchkiss stated that the
“number of applications was down
this year. This reflects the growing
knowledge and ability of high school
college counselors who are thus more
able to produce a realistic application.
“This class is the first group from
the Korean Conflict baby boom, but
the total increase in applications is
being tempered by the directions of
the guidance counselors. Our ultimate
goal, after additional dorms are built
is 360 resident freshmen cach year;
we're very optimistic.”

president is selected and takes office.

Selection Committee

A selection committee of four

trustees, consulting with a faculty ad-

| visory committee and representatives

of the Alumni Board of Directors, will
work on the selecting of a new presi-
dent. Dr. John Newton Thomas of
Richmond, a trustee since 1938, is
chairman of the committee,

Dr. Pusey, 56, joined the W&L
faculty in 1939 as an associate pro-
fessor of German. He subsequently
became a full professor and head of
the department. He was named dean
of the college in 1960.

Dr. Pusey earned his B.S. degree
at Haverford College, an A.M. at
Harvard, and his Ph.D, at Columbia.
He has traveled in Europe and studied
in Bonn, Heidelberg, and Munster.

Dr. Pusey’s major study field has
been German impressionism, especi-
ally the writings of Eduard von

Interim President William W. Pusey III

Keyserling. Also specializing in
American-German literary relations,
he recently taught courses in Russian
and comparative literature at W&L.

Dr. Pusey has written two books,
“Louis-Sebastien Mercier in Ger-
many,” his doctoral thesis, published
in 1939, and “Readings in Military
German,” which he co-authored in
1943. The author of reviews and
articles in scholarly journals, he is a
regular contributor of book reviews
in “The Roanoke Times.”

Honorary Societies

He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa
and Omicron Delta Kappa. He also
holds membership in the American
Council of Learned Societies, the
Southern Humanities Conference, and
the Modern Language Association of
America. He is a member of Region
V of the selection board for the
Woodrow Wilson National Fellow-
ships. He was a panelist at the Na-
tional Summer Conference for Aca-
demic Deans at Oklahoma State Uni-
versity in August, 1966.

Dr. Pusey is a former member of
the Lexington and Rockbridge County
school boards and a former president
of the area Community Chest drive.

During World War Il, Dr. Pusey
served 39 months in the U. §, Naval
Reserve. He left the service as a lieu-
tenant commander. He was cited for
his work as an interpreter in the
interrogation of the German Naval
Comand after the war.

Dr. Pusey was born in Wilmington,
Del. in 1910, the son of William W.
and Edith L. Pusey. He married Mary
Hope Smith in 1940. They have two
children, Mary Faith and Diana Enid

 

Pusey.

 

 

 

Letters To The Editor...

 

Alumnus vs. Visitors

7 Sept. 67
To The Editor of the Ring-tum Phi
Sir:

WAL’s board of visitors are once
again faced with the task of finding
a new president—one, hopefully, who
might stay at the job—and I would
like to submit some views for the
purpose at least of promoting some
thought on the matter. I write not
only as an alumnus whose roots are
deep in the university but as a news-
man with a superficial knowledge of
some of the trends within smaller
colleges across the country.

These suggestions are based on what{ Yale,

I would regard as two relevant facts:
the recent spread of junior colleges
across Virginia (and Florida) and,
further, on the burgeoning wealth
that has come in recent years to such

institutions as Harvard, MIT, Leland)

Stanford, etc.

No Competition

In a very real sense, WAL can't
hope to compete with either group.
A very great many highly talented
students who cannot afford W&L (or
Williams, or Dartmouth, or Princeton)
will go to junior colleges near their
homes—-and if they're talented
enough, get scholarships to Harvard,
MIT, ete.

This leads me to the
that WAL must become, and rather
quickly too, a broadly innovative cen-
ter of some particular field.

In order to find a man who can
develop a new academic atmosphere
in Lexington, the search, | believe,
should be conducted by a new and
far younger board of visitors. With
all due regard for the splendid service
that has been rendered by Mr. St
Clair and his colleagues, their best
service now would be to retire from
the fray and let younger men take on

their mission—certainly those of
them who have passed their 65th
year

| have no real hope this might

happen unless there is a wide accept-
ance of the theory and this can only
action within alumni
groups and on the campus and the
only way this can be activated is if
the Alumni Bulletin will carry this
letter to WAL's alumni groups

“Authentic Scholars”

If a younger
board—unencumbered by
of WAL's “traditions” that belong in
history books (the last time they were
uprooted by Robert Edward
Lee)—the search bold young
man might be extended beyond the
borders of the Confederacy. Treason?
No, il with WAL's old boast
of being the most “cosmopolitan

men who are authentic schloars—
fund-raisers too—beyond the Old
Dominion.

Finally, | would think if some
daring young man were found, he
might seek a “congress” of presidents
of colleges comparable to W&L which,
over a period of not-too-many-years,
might assign to each some major
spheres offered by Harvard, MIT,
Leland Stanford, ete.

Joke?

With all due and warm regard for
my old friend, Charlie Light, I sub-
mit it as something close to a joke
that W&L would believe it can com-
pete with the law schools of Harvard,

 

conclusion |

the University of Virginia,
Duke, etc. When I say that I bear in

imind the hallowed memories of such

luminaries as John W. Davis, Newton
Baker, Herbert Fitzpatrick, etc., ad
ad, of our law school.

Let's begin now to concentrate upon

| a single field in which WAL will rate,

not in atmosphere which, God spare
us, is passe, but in scholarship.

I suspect this will fall upon the
deaf ears of Mr. St. Clair and of
others. It might, conceivably, blow.
up a little dust. And where there's
dust, there's a road.

I invite other alumni and students
to begin discussing this question and
to write the Alumni News, or to
members of the board their views on
how the university may or must now
orient itself to a situation in which
it is woefully out of date.

 

Sincerely,
Duncan G. Groner

35-0 To Tough Guilford 11

This first article must report a very
disappointing beginning to the Gen-
erals 1967 season—a very sharp Guil-
ford College eleven defeated W&L
35-0. Things were at sixes and sevens
all day last Saturday, as W&L allowed
a 76-yard touchdown punt return,
threw three passes that were inter-
cepted, and failed to tackle properly
time and again.

In spite of W&L’s performance, the
coaching staff singled out for praise
the punting of senior co-captain Rudd
Smith, a Summerville, S. C. native
who kicked for a 46.0 average for
nine punts; and senior fullback Bill
McDavid; sophomore fullback Phil
Jones; sophomore quarterback Chuck
Kuhn; senior co-captain tackle Phil
Thompson; and sophomore end Pete
Piltz for their offensive efforts. On de-
fense, mention went to sophomore
halfback John Nolan, who ran back
a 25-yard pass interception; junior
end Ken Long; junior linebacker Fran
Lawrence; junior tackle Britt Me-
Junkin; and sophomore linebacker
Dean Kumpuris.

W&L took 60 players to Greens-
boro, N. C., including eight fresh-
