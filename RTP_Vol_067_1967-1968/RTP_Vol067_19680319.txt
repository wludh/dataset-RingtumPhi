Fifth Annual Gilbert & Sullivan Operetta

 

FROGS To Present ‘Patience’

The Friends and Relatives Of Gil-
bert and Sullivan (FROGS) will pro-
duce the opera “Patience” on March
21-23 at the Lylburn Downing School
in Lexington. Each performance will
begin at 8 p.m.

“Patience” makes the fifth con-
secutive annual joint venture of the
Lexingion Kiwanis Club and the
FROGS. The series began with “HMS
Pinafore” in 1964 and has successively
included “lolanthe,” “Pirates of Penz-
ance” and “The Mikado,”

Unpaid Performers

The participants in the show and
orchestra have loosely organized them-
selves into the FROGS to provide
for continuity of planning for future
productions. Nobody in the cast,
chorus or orchestra is paid. The entire
show is a voluntary effort springing
from interest in the community and
a particular fondness for Gilbert and
Sullivan.

The Kiwanis Club supplies man-
power for many support committees:
finances the heavy initial outlays for
scores, orchestra parts and costume
rental: solicits advertising support,
and sells the bulk of the tickets. All
proceeds from the show after ex-
penses support the Lexington Kiwanis
Club's Sholarship Fund for area high
school graduates.

Community Cooperates

As in the past, this year's show is
an excellent example of community
cooperation. Professor Joseph  B.
Thompson, the producer, is a psycho-
logy professor at WAL; Lee Kahn,
the director, is also on the faculty
WAL and is the mentor of the
lroubadours: Mrs. Royster Lyle, co-
director, serves on the faculty at
Southern Seminary; Col. Bierly, the
conductor, is a faculty member at
VMI: Mrs. Tyson Wilson, the chorus
master, is the director of a local
church choir; and David Hall, another
WAL. faculty member, has done the
set design

The principal roles are being sung
by residents of Buena Vista, Lexine
ton, and Rockbridge County; faculty
members of both WAL and VMI,
students from WAL, Southern Semi
nary, and Lexington and Parry Me

Southern Collegian Second
Edition To Appear Today
With Article On The Draft

The second edition of the South-
ern Collegian appeared today, featur-
ing an article on the draft by Con-
gressman Bill Brock of Tennessee, a
Washingion and Lee alumnus. In the
article, Brock raises the question of
an all-volunteer Army.

The third edition of the Collegian
is set to appear the week of April
9th, with an article by Strom Thur-
mond. The fourth edition will be de-
voted to the Mock Convention and
should be ready for distribution at
that time.

When asked about the financial
position of the Collegian, editor-pub
lisher Steve Saunders said, “We'll
probably lose money.” Saunders went
on to say, “Our object last year was
to preserve the magazine.” The South-
ern Collegian was founded in 1868
at Washington and Lee, making it
the oldest collegiate magazine in the
South.

The Collegian has applied for a
corporation charter in Virginia, and
plans to become part of the Com

Last night the Executive Committee
decided to replace Lane Steinger as
head of the Curriculum Committee.
The action was the result of the
failure of the committee to produce
a report On its activities after a num-
ber of requests by the EC,

[he proposal to remove Steinger
was passed unanimously by the EC.
Applications will be accepted for the
rest of this week from students who
would be interested in serving as
chairman of the Curriculum Commit-
tee.

SCC Fines

In other actions, fines were added
to the list of possible alternatives by
the Student Control Committee on
students who are rowdy in public
during the Mock Convention parade.

 

SEE NOTICE BELOW
ee

The idea was proposed by Steve
Saunders to serve as a means of con-
trolling those students who would be
unphased by conduct and social proba-
tion ‘because of the nearness of the
Convention to graduation and the
end of the academic year.

Peter Kintz, chairman of the SCC,
said that the action might help to
keep the students under control and
that the committee would consider
both the size and instance of the fines
primarily on the individual cases that
might come up. He also stated that

Convention Fines

The Executive Committee of the
Student Body has given the Stu-
dent Control Committee special fin-
ing powers in addition to its regu-
lar disciplinary powers for the
weekend of the Mock Convention,
This has been done in an attempt
fo prevent any ungentlemanly con-
duct that may take place during
that weekend,

Under this system a violator may
be reported by one of the Mock
Convention “sergeants-at-arms.” A
violator will be subject to the usual
disciplinary action by the Student
Control Committee (conduct probo-
tion, social probation, denial of
participation in graduation § cere-
monies, etc.) and/or a fine.

On next Tuesday night, March 26,
the Student Bar Association Speaker
Program will present a talk by US.
District Judge Robert M. Merhige,
Jr. The topic of Judge Merhige's talk
will be announced later in the week.

\ native of New York, Judge
Merhige did his undergraduate work
at High Point College, High Point,
N. C., where he was President of his
class and a member of both the foot
ball and basketball teams, as well as
sports editor of the college paper. He
went on to do his graduate work at
the University of Richmond Law
School where he was secretary of the
Student Bar and Chancellor of the

ciety, and honorary scholastic society

he hoped that the possibility of fines
would prevent their use being needed.
The EC also approved giving to the
Mock Convention $249.04 as the
balance on appropriations given in
past years to the Interim Coordinat-
ing Committee. The money is to be
used to pay outstanding bills left over
from the Interim Committee.
Richard Nash said that flowers had
been sent to Tom Baremore’s family
in the behalf of the student body and
that he had written a letter as well.

Honor System

Danny Leonard reported on the
possibility of sending to incoming
freshmen a brochure on the honor
system. This would possibly be in-
corporated in a letter from the presi-
dent of the student body. Action on
this was deferred until the possible
costs could be ascertained.

 

Poetry Reading
Set For Tonight

Professor George Garrett, author
and professor of English at Hollins
College, will conduct a poetry read-
ing in the Bookstore tonight at 8.
After the reading, Mr. Garrett will
engage in an informal conversation
period with his audience.

“Informal” is the word to describe
Professor Garrett's presentation, Mrs,
Betty Munger, manageress, plans to
have the bookshelves placed against
the walls and benches set up. Those
people attending the lecture may sit
on the benches or on the floor. Pro-
fessor Garrett will not only read
poetry but also, Mrs. Munger hopes,
excerpts from his forthcoming novel.
After the reading, Mr. Garrett will
lead an informal discussion on the
creative process. Free coffee will be
provided during the evening.

Before coming to Hollins, Mr. CGar-
rett had a varied career. He is a

 

native of Florida and was graduated

magna cum laude from Princeton
University. Far from having a strictly
academic career, Prof. Garrett has
been employed in such occupations as
bartender, truck driver, weightlifting
instructor, football coach, and mem-
ber of a geophysical team. He also
taught at Wesleyan, Rice, Princeton
and the University of Virginia prior
to assuming his post at Hollins

Versatile and prolific, Prof
rett has written several
poetry and short stories, three novels,
and a play. Among his most
works are a book of poems,

Goat
volumes of

recent

“For A

Bitter Season.” a collection of short
stories, “Cold Ground Was My Bed
Last Night.” a novel, “Do, Lord,
Remember Me,” and his play, “Sit
Slob and the Princes.”

Other works which he has pro
duced have earned Profesor Garrett

numerous awards and prizes

Gearrett has served as an edilor a

well as an author. Besides editing
several books, he has been poetry
editor of several magazines, including

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s ‘Twice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, March 19, 1968

 

A good friend
Tommy Mac Baremore will be missed. He was serious and
sincere; he had determination, based upon knowledgeability;
he had a fine sense of perspective, and a rare sense of humor.
Most of all, he possessed understanding. In no respect, at any
time, did he fail to serve his University well, to represent it
admirably. He brought much to Washington and Lee, and
left much to it.

We are not good at eulogizing. But we are profoundly
grateful to him. We shall miss him very, very much.

The Troubs: Yet another success

The Troubadours have done it again. Before last week, we
would have told you it was highly improbable that they could
ever equal the quality of last year’s electrifying ‘Marat/
Sade.” But “The Country-Wife,” which closed night before last
after an “extended run,” is as delightful as “Marat” was
terrifying; as entertaining as “Marat” was disturbing; as well
acted and staged as a Broadway play; and as much a credit to
the players, the director, and everybody else connected with
it as any play we have ever seen. Don Baker, the student di-
rector, is to be congratulated in particular for having suc-
cessfully maintained the masterful tradition established these
few years by permanent director Lee Kahn. We simply don’t
have at our command enough superlatives to describe ‘The
Country-Wife” (neither do we have enough anti-superlatives
to describe the Troubs’ “theatre’’-building, but this is sup-
posed to be a joyous editorial anyway . . .).

Observation and commentary

We've been reading our junk mail again. This week’s most
audacious request comes from a Denver publisher who’s put-
ting out a pamphlet and who thinks the Ring-tum Phi ought
to give him free publicity. The booklet is mimeographed
(not printed); it is 164 pages long. And the Ring-tum Phi
is expected to send three dollars by return mail for a review

copy.

 

It’s probably instructive to observe a large group of students
while they are watching Cronkite or Huntley-Brinkley. The
freshmen find it hilarious. The sophomores are amused and
entertained, though not quite so much. Juniors are noticeably
uneasy. And seniors panic.

Letter from the Editor

Allow us, if you will, to com-
ment on unsigned  letters4o-he-
editor. We published one last week,
and apparently some people took it as
a sign to begin cranking them out—
even if they are so very pointless and
inane as to leave no impression

 

The Ring4tum Phi hasn't (yet) re-
ceived The Word From On High. If
you don't like what we say, we won't
become irrational and seek your im-
mediate destruction. And there are
people in the world who send us
signed letters of criticism (see right,
for instance), so we know we're not

other than that somebody wants to
get into print (even if it’s only the
Ring-tum Phi).

The odds are very great indeed
that, upon receiving such anonymous
letters, we will laugh and throw them
away. We won't publish them indis-
criminately, and by their very na-
ture we probably won't publish them
diseriminately, either. Signed letters
are invariably published in one of
the two Editions, unless their con-
temt is such that publication would
bring us legal grief—and in that case,
we let the writer know, Unsigned
letters will be published only at the
Editor's exceedingly infrequent pleas-
ure

The Ring-tum

 

mad to expect more of them to be
signed. Editors of both Editions are,

by the way, able and willing to
keep identities confidential, if you
insist.

Finally, a point or two concerning
last week's unsigned letier. It was
perhaps the most outlandish,  ill-
reasoned tripe ever written by a stu-
dent at this University (assuming the
writer is, or was, a student), and it
was published exactly as we received
it, as a sort of Essay In Absurdity.
The writer said he felt compelled
to keep his identity a dark secret out
of an instinct for “self-preservation.”
Well, personally, we feel it was prob-

ably out of self-respect.

Dr. Leyburn Previews Latest
Production By The FROGS

By JAMES G. LEYBURN

Professor of Sociology and
Chief Resident Savoyard

The Gilbert and Sullivan addict,
like that fleshy poet Bunthorne, is
not fond of uttering platitudes in
stained-glass attitudes; but it is clear
to him that Gilbertian wit is unparal-
leled in its Victorian intellectuality,
and that Sullivan's music in the operas
is, quite simply, incomparable.

“Patience,” whose reincarnation
is this week to be witnessed in Lex-
ington, ranks very high in the canon
of the 13 operas. There are those
who claim that it is the perfect mar-
riage of deft satire and musical rail-
lery, of gay erudition and beguiling
melody. It is the third of the “P”
operas, following “Pinafore” and “The
Pirates of Penzance.”

Gilbert, having by now wielded his
Aristophanic scalpel upon the Royal
Navy, country curates, major-gener-
als, lawyers and juries, and other
diverting English fauna, turns his sar-
donic eye upon contemporary English
flora—upon the cult of aestheticism.

1880's Heyday

The 1880's were the heyday of
Oscar Wilde, Algernon Swinburne,
and James McNeill Whistler. Oscar
astounded the sedate middle-class by
lecturing in a flowered waistcoat, a
velvet jacket and knee-britches, while
dandling a languid lily in his mediaev-
al hand. Algernon’s idyllic and raptur-
ous poems, frequently incomprehen-
sible to those who swooned over
them, were quoted with appropriate
hand-waving at high teas and week-
ends at country houses. The redoubt-
able James, having introduced the
arty set to Japanese prints and misty
riverscapes, had become high-priest
of a cult of Orientalism (which four
years after “Patience” was to be
laughed at in “The Mikado”).

All audiences at “Patience,” wheth-
er composed of novices or smug de-

votees, have a perfect love-affair
with the ladies of the opera: the
twenty love-sick maidens (love-sick

all against their will), in their aesthetic
draperies; Lady Jane, whose ampli-
tude is matched by that of the ‘cello
(sometimes a bass-viol) she lugs
about; and that innocent dairy-maid,
Patience herself, who (though not on

 

a monument) smiles at grief as she
watohes the aesthetic ladies pining
for their poets.

Magnificent Uniforms

As for the males, the slightly
addled officers of the Dragoon
Guards, in their magnificent uniforms,
divert the audience as much as the
ladies—even though the guardsmen
are not Empyrean nor Della Crus-
can nor even Early English. Bun-
thorne and Grosvenor (the Wilde and
Swinburne of the opera) are the
embodiment of passing literary fash-
ions. Bunthorne, soulfully intense,
very precious, and somewhat droop-
ing, has eventually to yield to Gros-
venor (Archibald the All-Right), who
admits that his beauty is without
rival (“Would that I were but a
thought less beautiful than I am; but
candour compels me to admit that
I'm not!”).

Music-lovers cite the sextette (“I
hear the soft note of the echoing)
voice”) and the “Prithee, pretty
maiden” duet as two of the lovieliest
moments in all the operas. The Colo-
nel’s patter song, Bunthorne’s recita-
tive and discourse upon aestheticism,
the counterpoint of the protesting
Dragoons and the rapturous Maidens,
Lady Jane's dirge upon the state of
her figure, and the moralistic Magnet
and the Churn—these musical inspira-
tions are, as Lady Angela might say,
“too all-but.”

Gilbert as usual flatters the intel-
ligence of his audiences, and the fact
that the original “Patience” had a
run of 408 performances (with all
1300 seats taken at each perform-
ance) proves that the English audi-
ences were knowledgeable people.
Lexingtonians are not less so. Who,
among the hordes who will flock to
hear the local performances, will not
be able to pass with flying colors
(cobwebby grey velvet, no doubt) the
following Savoyard quiz? Identify
quickly Pandaean pleasure, Daphne-

 

phoric bound, Boucicault, peak-
haunting Peveril, Tupper, Sir Garnet
(thrashing a cannibal), Sir Paget
(about to trepan), Aceldama, Gros-

venor Gallery, Sewall & Cross, Jul-
lien (the eminent musico), and Cul-
ture’s palmiest day.

 

The chorus of love sick maidens,

 

By KLAUS EDER

Most of the reactions to my re-
marks reveal a symptomatic aspect:
they fail the real object I was con-
cerned with. One of my minor points
was a “so-called conservatism,” with
which label I seem to have touched
on most cherished values. In a kind
of self-defense the reactions fell back
on a sterile repetition of old argu-
ments they are only retelling old, old
stories, while casting things in my
teeth I never said,

Rather another kind of conservatism
is prevalent (and I am going to formu-
late this much harsher this time, aware
of probable ridiculous scorchers of
intolerance or monopoly of toler-
ance—no matter how meaningless
these labels are; for 1 made never
such a claim): W&L gentlemen—in
the jori in the following
ideal type: they cannot detach them-
selves in order to observe, much less
to evaluate; they are stirred by Satur-
day classes and the like; they are for
progress, but not too fast.

                

 

 

The More Things Change aes

 

Roaring °20’s Similar

By REEVE W. KELSEY

“Educationally your Alma Mater
seems on the eve of a great develop-
ment. The air of the campus is
vibrant with optimism and enthusi-
asm. Overflowing numbers, entire
harmony, athletic success, freedom
from misbehavior and disorder and
college spirit—all these combine to
make from the educational standpoint
a happy present and a bright future.”

Thus wrote Henry Louis Smith,
WAL’s seemingly eccentric president
of the "Twenties, on Page Three of
the January 13th, 1920, Alumni Edi-
tion of the Ring-tum Phi, As a matter
of fact, Smith's incessant writing of
letters to be published in the Ring-
tum Phi appears to today’s reader to
be quaint and amusing.

Impoverished Condition

Smith moved on and outlined the
impoverished condition of the Un-
versity’s finances: “Its tiny endowment
equals only $1,500 per student, instead
of the $6,400 which is now the aver-
age of colleges of its type .. . Financi-
ally she is facing dire emergency.”

Smith finished his message with a
plea to the alumni: “The Alumni of
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth,
Cornell, Leland Stanford are all rally-
ing to their imperiled institutions with
a magnificent zeal, a unanimous self-
sacrifice, a record-breaking liberality.”

“Let the Alumni of our historic
institution see to it that in this un-
exampled financial emergency their
Alma Mater shall not be crippled in
her great work for the lack of ade-
quated financial support, that her
energies shall be released to answer
the call of her great opportunity, and
that even more in the future than
in the past she shall be the South's
most fruitful nursery of America’s
leadership.”

they stay the same

Southern Collegian is a bit too heavy

Eder Clarifies Reform Crlticlenis
Of Traditional W&L Institutions

five hours before the spring dances

 

Apathy, parietal system and fra-
ternity system are only the “func-
tional requisites” which keep the sys-
tem going. The core of the problem
lies in the faculty. That is why I
should blame the faculty above all.
(I didn’t make that point very clear in
my first article; | owe the clarification
to the several responses I got in re-
action to it).

I think the real “ill” of this campus
is the composition of the student body.
A comparison of the social bio-
graphies of W&L students shows that
most come from moderately wealthy,
upper-middle-chass families. Alumni
and fathers of students tend to be
businessmen; the faculty is business-
oriented (at least in its key positions);
thus higher education here preserves
a situation which was quite common
several decades ago, characterized as
the “Golden Age and Gilded Cage.”

Business-Class Dominated

Higher learning is dominated by the
business-class and its business-men-
tality. It constitutes a caste-system.
attracting only young men of a speci-
fic social and economic background,
a homogeneous group and anti-intel-
lectual crowd. The system is breeding
and reproducing a caste with its value-
system, the business-class,

I have to ask the question: how are
such attitudes conypatible with demo-
cratic culture, with the “rules of the
game” of democracy? How are ex-
clusiveness, a caste structure and a
homogeneous value system compat-
ible with an open society?

Today in Germany, we talk often
about education for democracy, learn-
ing. how to live with conflicts funda-
mental to a democratic society—and

W&L Pugilists Participate In Golden Gloves Tourney

A joke in November became a
reality last week as sophomore Logan
Scott, “The Greenwood (S.C.) Fist”
boxed his way to the semi-finals of
the Virginia AAU Golden Gloves
Tournament,

The joke started when Tony Glea-
son, freshman law student and Notre
Dame boxing veteran, asked Scott
what he was doing. Scott said he was
Golden Gloves—and after over three
months of rigorous training, Gleason
made Scott true to his word,

Training

rhe co-training of Seott and Glea-
son was not an easy job. Working
out by themselves, a routine workout
consisted of 600 jumping jacks, 100
pushups, 150 situps, drills, strategy
sessions, sparring, speedbag workouts,
and road work every morning.

As they reflect on the period, W&L’s
boxers conceded that more sparring
would have been helpful.

Scott entered the tournament, spon-
sored by Richmond's West End Jay-
cees, aS a novice, meaning that he
had boxed less than six bouts, In
fact, Logan had never actually boxed
before. Gleason entered the open
competition.

lhe first night in Richmond, Scott
worried about his weight, his combi-
nations, and his life. But he didn’t
need to worry, as after a mere 35
seconds he had TKO’d his opponent.
Scott entered the small ring (“there's
no room to run”) as though his life
depended on what he did. He promptly
knocked his opponent down; the other

boxer got up, then was knocked down |

Was precipitated by a blow that drew
blood on his chin. A TKO was award-

ed his opponent.
The next night, Gleason was in
Scott’s corner. From the other side

of the ring came what looked like a
Grecian god, but Scott was confident.

Scott Outboxes Opponent

And almost rightly so. Scott out-
boxed his opponent for two rounds,
winning both on points. But in the
third and last round, after one minute,
Scott was hit hard in the face and
reeled back into the ropes. He was
out on a TKO,

After the fight, Scott warned his
vistor “You'd better stay in shape,
because I'll be back next year.” After
a short training break, Scott plans to
start practicing again.

There are current plans to start a
boxing club at W&L, so that next
year the schools can send a team to
Richmond. This would make W&L
eligible for a team trophy.

With the kind of help that Gleason
and Scott obtained this year, the club
already has a head start. The Physical
Education department went out of its
way to help the boys in their training.

A Lot of Help

Coach Lord refereed practice bouts
between Scott and Gleason, as well
as gave his advice and criticism on
certain strategy. Coach Miller always
was willing to give the two boxers
whatever supplies they needed, in-
cluding on their 2-day trip to Rich-
mond. Coach Stearns was the trainer.

Gleason’s boxing coach at Notre
Dame, Coach Napolitono, sent prac-

to observe how democratic education
functions and have to recognize how
a caste system defends itself against
democracy. (In my last article I call-
ed that phenomenon a “glass-cave”;
it would probably be better to call
it a “hot-house,” where holy tradi-
tions are rendered immune against the
outside world),

Dissenting “Outcasts”

The “outcasts” of this campus are
the dissenters. Their attitudes, even
their existence, are regarded as sort
of illegitimate on this campus. Never
really bothered by opposite view-
points, in peaceful harmony and con-
formity, with never challenged atti-
tudes, the W&L_ gentleman goes
through his college experiences with
an “echoing monologue!”

Another strikingly similar feature
became manifest while looking at the
attempts of reform by Woodrow Wil-
son, as Baltzall describes it: “Wilson
actually desired to make Princeton
an even more homogeneous body of
gentlemen-scholars. His preceptorial
and quadrangle plans envisioned a
series of small and intimate groups of
students and faculty-members pursu-
ing knowledge without the disruptive
class-decisions fostered by the existing
club system.”

Reformers Have Failed

Wilson failed; reformers on the
W&L campus have failed too. They
were too much of a “threat to the
system so dear to the hearts of many
powerful trustees.” But in the mean-
time Princeton has found its way into
modernity, Why does W&L still stay
aside?

¢

Several conclusions can now be
drawn:
1) W&L lags behind the historical
development;

2) The caste-like establishment on
this campus has already passed
its peak; the social defense of
caste is only an artificial one;

3) The modernizing counterattack
at W&L is overdue,

The last point suggests political act-
ion. And that is the most difficult
question: for “what” and “how” should
we change? Should we concentrate on
changes of institutional structures
which affect the student while he is
living here (I suggested abolition of
paternalism) or on those which affect
the type of students attracted? Where
one starts depends on policy-judg-
ments and possibilities, But a change
in one institutional structure will have
effects upon the rest of the system too,

at least it will upset the state of
equilibrium which seems to me—after
looking at it from different perspec-
tives—rather worthwhile.

Two-Fold Attack

Necessary would be a two-fold at-
tack (but that is probably utopian):
an abolition of paternalism which
makes that campus attractive for a
different kind of students too; a
revolution in the orientation of the
Admissions Office, a large dedication
of resources to the attraction of stu-
dents from various social and eco-
nomic backgrounds, and the recruit-
ment of a less business-oriented and
more anti-establishment faculty (1
borrowed the last three formulations
from a letter I received after the
publication of my first article).

The consequences could be a new
image, and maybe the realization of
possibilities which were restricted by
a mere traditionalistic and backwards
looking faculty and University ad-
ministration, those powerful and
sacred columns of persistence (ob-
stinacy).

MONEY: THE STORY OF AN ENGINEER

We all know, of course, that in this age of technology
every engineering senior is receiving fabulous offers of
employment, but do we realize just how fabulous these
offers are? Do we comprehend just how keenly industry
is competing? To illustrate, let me cite the true and typi-
cal case of E. Pluribus Ewbank, a true and typical senior.

One day last week while strolling across the M.1.T.
campus, E. Pluribus was hailed by a portly and prosper-
ous man who sat in a yellow convertible studded with
precious gem stones. “Hello,” said the portly and pros-
perous man, “I am Portly Prosperous, president of
American Xerographic Data Processing and Birth Con-
trol, Incorporated. Are you a senior?”

“Yes, sir,” said E. Pluribus.

“Do you like this car?” said Portly.

“Yes, sir,” said E. Pluribus.

“It’s yours,” said Portly.

“Thanks, hey,” said E. Pluribus.

“Do you like Personna Super Stainless Stee! Blades?”
said Portly.

“What clean living, clean shaven American does not?”
said E. Pluribus.

“Here is a pack,” said Portly. “And a new pack will
be delivered to you every twelve minutes as long as you
live.”

“Thanks, hey,” said E. Pluribus.

“Would your wife like a mink coat?” said Portly.

“I feel sure she would,” said E. Pluribus, “but I am
not married.”

“Do you want to be?” said Portly.

“What clean living, clean shaven American does not?”
said E. Pluribus.

Portly pressed a button on the dashboard of the con-
vertible and the trunk opened up and out came a nubile
maiden with golden hair, rosy knees, a perfect disposi-
tion, and the appendix already removed. “This is Svet-
lana O'Toole,” said Portly. “Would you like to marry her?”

“Is her appendix out?” said E. Pluribus.

“Yes,” said Portly.

“Okay, hey,” said E. Pluribus.

“Congratulations,” said Portly. “And for the happy
bride, a set of 300 monogrammed prawn forks.”

“Thanks, hey,” said Svetlana,

 

“Now then,” said Portly to E. Pluribus, “let us get
down to business. My company will start you at $75,000
a year, You will retire at full salary upon reaching the
age of 26. We will give you an eleven-story house made of
lapis lazuli, each room to be stocked with edible furniture,
Your children will receive a pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades every twelve minutes as long as they
shall live. We will keep your teeth in good repair and also
the teeth of your wife and children unto the third genera-
tion, We will send your dentist a pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades every twelve minutes as long as
he shall live, and thereafter to his heirs and assigns...
Now, son, I want you to think carefully about this offer,
Meanwhile here is 50 thousand dollars in small, un-
marked bills which places you under no obligation what-
soever.”’

“Well, it certainly seems like a fair offer,” said E.
Pluribus, “But there is something you should know, | am
not an engineer. In fact | don't go to M.L.T. at all, I just
walked over here to admire the trees. | am at Harvard,
majoring in Joyce Kilmer.”

“Oh,” said Portly.

“I guess I don't get to keep the money and the con-
vertible and the Personnas and the broad, do 1?” said EF
Pluribus.

“Of course you do,” said Portly. “And if you'd like the
job, my offer still stands.”
