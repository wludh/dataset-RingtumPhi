THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper

Tuesday, November 21, 1967

We Think...

... our colleague on the Friday Edition, perhaps looking for
editorial fodder, inferred a number of things from our last
editorial that simply were not implied in it.

Ex Libris

‘While there has been improvement in library support in
recent years, there is substantial indication that library financ-
ing is still far below reasonable adequacy. The latest figures in
the Self-Study Report show that the University is spending
3.5% of its total educational and general expenditures for li-
brary purposes. A national minimum library standard suggested
for this ratio is 5% and the best libraries demand much more
than the minimum.”

—Report of the Visiting Committee to Washington and Lee
University, November 1966.

+

 

 

* *

In this the best of all possible worlds, the McCormick Li-
brary is not the best of all possible libraries. The report of the
Visiting Committee goes on to state, “By whatever gauge one
uses, Washington and Lee’s support of its library lags.” We
feel that the University must move promptly and firmly
until McCormick Library is above standard. W&L cannot af-
ford government by crisis, waiting until the last possible mom-
ent before salvaging the library.

A library is often considered to be one of the most im-
portant assets of a college or university. It is not by coincidence
that Yale and Harvard have two of the world’s best libraries.

There are, however, several changes that can be made
which will immediately benefit the student body without pro-
hibitive expense.

First, the library should be opened earlier on Sundays.
Apparently students are not supposed to be intellectually in-
clined until 3 p.m. on Sundays. This is patently untrue. Any
check of the campus at noon or earlier will indicate a large
number of students who do, indeed, study on Sunday morn-
ing. The major reason given for keeping the library closed
during this time is that there is not enough money to pay
someone to man the desk for three additional hours. But any
glance at the desk evenings will usually reveal a student and
a library assistant manning the check-out desk. This appears
to be a wasteful duplication of resources, considering the in-
ability to finance three additional hours on Sundays.

Of secondary priority would be keeping the library open
later on weeknights. The lights on in the fraternity houses and
dormitories at midnight show that a vast majority of students
are far from asleep at this time. The library should be kept

 

open until 2 a.m. or later to accommodate these students.

We would suggest a month trial period to determine if the
student demand is high enough to continue the practice. If
this is not possible a sincere effort should be made to keep
the library open until 2 a.m. during exam period and the week
preceding it.

It seems folly to deny the student body the use of one of
the University’s most valuable assets when there is sufficient
demand for its use. And it seems equal folly not to finance the

lib to its full potential.

Highlights Of A

Trip Through

Ye Olde McCormicke Librarye

By MILLARD FILLMORE

Can anyone imagine a greater thrill
than being the first person in 91
years to check out a library book?
No. There is no human experience
greater than being the very first per-
son to check out the Rev. N. M.
Ferrers’s “An Elementary Treatise on
Trilinear Co-ordinates, The Method
of Reciprocal Polars, and the Theory
of Projections,” London, 1876.

Of a lesser thrill would have been
to take out Crozet’s “Treatise on
Descriptive Geometry” which has left
the library twice (1935, 1954) since
it was published in 1821. In recent
ramblings through the ivy-covered
stacks of McCormick Library, I pick-
ed a shelf completely at random of
33 books which went from 516.0;J5Ir
to 516.57:L668p (for those not con-
versant in the Dewy Decimal System
this means Euclidean analytic geome-
try). The mean age of the books
(determined from date of being pub-
lished) was 1922.

Greatly Improved Average

The average, however, was a great-
ly improved 1924. This encourages
one to think that the math that one
learns today will still be true in
1994, so that the library will, indeed,
need not purchase any more books
on Euclidean analytic geometry.

But let’s look at another randomly
selected shelf. ... This section was
all about 943.085;L669t to 943.085;-
§559w. Here the mean copyrighted
date was 1939 and the average 1941.
Quite an improvement over Euclidean
geomentry one would say, but only
those fully versed in the quirks of Dr.
Dewey would realize that this topic
is about Hitler's Germany. There
were only three, excuse me, two
books on Hitler's Germany on that

 

shelf of 28 books that were published

after 1945...three, I mean
cheers for historical perspective.

two

Recent Acquisitions

But let's move on to the more
recent library acquisitions. In fact,
the Friends of the Library recently
donated the “Collected Works of
William Morris” which encompasses
24 volumes. Other equally significant
collections is the 37 volume “Early
Western Travels” featuring such sig-
nificant travelogues of the Early West
as “Flagg’s Far West” and “Pattie’s
Personal Narrative.” Speaking of
travelogues, Alice Marriott's “Hell
on Horses and Women” acquired in
1954 has been taken out twice by
adventurous readers.

I don’t mean to attack collected
works; collected works in moderation
are fine. For example, every library
should have the collected works of
Voltaire. The more affluent libraries
could have two—one in English, the
other in French, but the McCormick
Library has three of 42 volumes, 52
volumes, and 75 volumes. Most likely
the library did not want anyone to
be unable to read Voltaire.

Other books that are a must for
any Christmas shopper, all to be
found in McCormick Library, are the
three-volume collection of the “Writ-
ings of Wilfrid Scawen Blunt” (some-
one please take it out; it has been
the shelves since 1940 untouched by
human hands.) There is the “Col-
lected Works of the Right Honorable
John Hookam Frere.” And one can
even find “To Kill A Mockingbird”
which was donated last year by a
student who was astounded to learn
that the library did not even own a
copy, so there, you now know of
the pleasures that await in the gold-
en stacks of Ye Olde McCormicke
Librarye.

Leyburn Discusses Christianity’s Future

By LARRY HONIG

the federal government is con-
tributing just over $19,500 this year
to Washington and Lee’s Work-Study
Program, which helps students on
scholarship earn money to repay their
loans.

Added to that figure is another
$3500 from the University; the result
is that about 70 students have on-
campus jobs with hourly pay. Such
jobs include laboratory assistants—
professors may request a certain per-
son or any student—library assistants,
workers in the bookstore, research as-
sistants, and those who help in the
office of the various deans by deliver-

around the campus, and so on.

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

I would like to underscore Profes- |
sor Duvall’s comments about student
dress on campus [Tuesday Edition
November 14], to wit that it is an
individual matter best learned at home
or in the fraternity houses. Certainly,
admissions policy should have no
bearing on it. A professor worth his
salt would quit before he would
tolerate a sartorial approach as to
who gets into Washington and Lee.

But there is another side to the
coin. Some students are slovenly
dressed, unshaven, at war with socks
and neckties. The other evening in
Evans Dining Hall, one was barefoot,
taking his chances, I assume, of hook-
worm infection.

 

The point I want to make is that

W&L’s Work-Study Plan
Receives Federal Grants

Work-Study Program here is 85%,
WAL's is 15%. Next year, the gov-
ernment will pay 80%, and the year
after that it will stop at 75%.

The government makes its money
available for both on-campus jobs and
off-campus jobs in non-profit ventures,
such as for the youth corps and in
poverty work. At present W&L uses
the funds to employ students in jobs
on the campus.

New Director

Head of the program here is W&L
graduate William A. Noell, who came
in September as director of financial
aid. Asked about the possibility of
increasing the government's total dol-
lar donation, Mr. Noel said “we're
trying substantially to increase the pro-
gram.” Allocations for mext year's
program will be announced in March.

‘Are You Saved?’ Is Obsolete

(Continued from page 2)

My prediction would be that the
church is more and more going to be
conceived as the servant of all man-
kind, not just as a gathering-place for
a small social clique on Sunday morn-
ing at eleven o'clock.

Why do we need these church build-
buildings, anyhow, just standing va-

 

 

IFC-Faculty Coffee
(Continued from page 1)

stated that the topic of the coffee
would be a discussion of the exist-
ing rush system. “Have the recent
reforms improved the system?”
“Would a deferred rush be better?”—
these are the major problems that
will be faced.

Baremore stated that there will
probably be a formal presentation of
the pro’s and con's of the issue, fol-
lowed by an informal discussion.

Last year’s coffee also dealt with
the topic of a deferred rush, from
which much debate ensued, but little
consensus.

cant there 167 hours out of the 168,
wasting all that property, all that
space that might be put to good use?
My guess is that the theology of the
church will certainly come in for a
great deal of discussion....

Situation ethics, as you know, is be-
ing very much talked about nowa-
days; and there is a widespread re-
jection of the old legalism that says
absolutely that one should never kill
or that one should never lie or that
one should never remarry after di-
VOrcé, ...

The situations do change, and...
this person-centered morality is not
very satisfying for the mass of man-
kind—it may be for very intelligent
and strong-minded and sensitive per-
sons. But I'd hate, as a parent, to
have to try to bring up my children
by not laying down any rules for
them whatsoever....1 don't believe
that’s going to work....

I think the whole question of
ethics and the proper basis for eth-
ics is again one of the things that

 

will certainly be discussed from now

 

until the end of this century. ...

And the final thing I will say. .. is
that in the church itself 1 think the
struggle during the next decades is
going to be between those clergymen
and laymen on the one hand who
want to move the church to support
and to induce social change, and the
laymen and clergymen on the other
hand who want to prevent change....

| think the conflict is going to
center on that issue. So it’s going to
be a very exciting time for Christian-
ity in the next thirty years.

 

Early Admissions

40 students have been accepted by
early decision in the fourth year of
WAL’s early acceptance program.

James D. Farrar, Dean of Admis-
sions and Assistant Dean of Students,
announced that out of the 52 who
applied for early admission, 40 were
accepted. This year, although fewer
applied, a greater proportion of those
who did apply were accepted.

All early acceptance candidates
must reply by December 1 as to
whether they will come to W&L or
not,

A Short History of The R-t Phi:

The War Years, ‘The Columns’

“Never have so few owed so much
to so few....”

In the long history of the Ring-tum
Phi (for those who consider 69 years
to be “long”), perhaps the unique-est
period came during World War II
when the Ring-tum Phi wasn't even
the Ring-tum Phi. “The Columns”—
billed as the “war-time successor to
the Ring-tum Phi’—published 59 is-
sues, every Friday of the college
year, in 1943, 1944 and 1945.

They were strange times.

transfers enrolled in the University
on August 21.... This group was
somewhat larger than expected,” the
Columns reported.

They ran pictures of the entire
freshman class each year. And they
ran the sex-and-society biographies of
every student, for want of anything
else: “Yates had a date for this
dance. In fact, she slept in his
room—while he stayed at the SAE
lodge.”

Editorial Turnover

The Columns had four (or maybe
five) editors in its short life. Trouble
seemed to be that nobody stayed in
school long enough to be editor more
than a term or so. One guy, in fact,
was elected editor one day and drafted
the next, so he never even put out a
paper. (But we'll guess he put it down
on election posters, job applications
and everywhere else he could, just
like students today.)

“The State Theatre,” the Columns
announced early in “45, “will be
closed until Monday at 7 o'clock, due
to natural gas shortages.”

“Last Tuesday night the Forensic
Union discussed rather heatedly,” a
1943 issue told, “the question, ‘Re-
solved: That Eleanor Roosevelt
should be sent to a South Seas Is-
land.’ The final vote upheld the nega-
tive side of the question.” Tsk, tsk.

“Innovations”?

And some of the things “innovated”
into the Ring-tum Phi lately just
aren't as new as the Ring-tum Phi
seems to think. The football contest,
for example. Only, then it was called
“You Pick Em” and the prize wasn't
a fiver—instead, you got two free
passes to the State Theatre (known,
incidentally, during the duration as
“Marse Ralph's’).

A big flap came when the faculty
decided to change the grade-point
system (A, 93-100; B, 84-92; C, 75-
83: D, 65-74; E, $0-64; F, below 50).
The headlines are even the same,
though the faces are different: “Phil-
lips Revises Economics Text.” Ogden
M. Phillips, that is.

The Big Issues weren't all that dif-
ferent. either: one editorial expounded,
“We have been noticing some particu-
larly ‘fine’ beards recently. We saw
one upperclassman with a particularly
pretty set of whiskers. It wasn't one
of these of two or three days’ growth
It was nice and full with just enough
shagginess to give it that rustic look
which is found only in the best beards
To be a ‘real’ Washington and Lee
gentleman you wont wear a Zoot
suit, but you will wear a growth of
beard on your cheeks and upper lip

We'll loan a razor to anyone who
wants to use it.”
Let's...

They tried to forget the war. “Lets
Fall In Love.” one oblivious editor
wrote. “Lets Dance. he wrote 4
month later. “Let There Be Music,

his successor wrote. “Spring Is Here!”
greeted readers one morning, “Sweet
Briar Asks Us Over.” No fewer than
six editorials over the two school
years were called “The Honor Sys-
tem.” It had to be that way. There
were, by appearances, no fewer than
six turnovers in membership of the
student body.

The people we know of today were
in the news, or at least in the Col-
umns. President Francis Pendleton
Gaines declined, during those two
years, the presidency of Rice Institute
and the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination in Virginia, among other
offers. Capt. William Hinton and
Maj. Frank Gilliam made the paper
from time to time. So did C. Harold
Lauck, then and now superintendent
of the W&L Print Shop, printer of the
Columns—so indispensible that one
day when Mr. Lauck was sick the
paper just didn’t come out,

War Was Here
The war wasn't entirely removed
from Lexington, though. “Ki Wil-

liams, president of the Alumni As-
sociation, learned that his alma mater
was a secret repository for priceless
Government documents, which may
have included Jefferson's manuscript
of the Declaration of Independence,
only when he looked into the muzzie
of a guard's automatic pistol, he
related today,” said what is perhaps
the longest sentence (considerably
abridged here) ever printed in the
Columns.

The Special Services School made
iis presence on campus known, too.
One SSS student wrote “An Ode To
Washington and Lee,” which does
not, sad to say, bear reprinting. The
SSS staged a show for the students
every term. But we'll bet that not
even their extravaganza “Hubba Hub-
ba” (1944) compared with some of
the movies “Marse Ralph” brought
to town. Like “This Is the Army,”
by Irving Berlin and starring George
Murphy and “Lt. Ronald Reagan.”
Not to mention “Brother Rat,” about
which no more need be said.

Yes, they were lean years for news.
(Not that the situation has changed
today, which is why this article was
written.) But the Columns did well,
and came out on time nearly always,
and people read the paper, and what
more can a newspaper ask for?

failed to go the required 10 yards so
the Bears took over the ball at the
Generals’ 47 yard line. Once agin, the
General defense allowed the Bears
only negligible yardage.

Back under the leadership of Kuhn,
only halfback Luke Crosland was able
to gain significant yardage. Even
Smith’s kicking average began to suf-
fer late in the second quarter when
one kick was blocked and others fell
short due to the strong Washington
rush.

In the third quarter, after a sus-
tained Washington drive, Oliver kick-
ed a field goal to break the tie and
put the Bears ahead.

The situation looked grim for the
Generals’ offense, but Bloom returned
to the game late in the third quarter.
Still, Bloom had been suffering from
blurred vision and was able to hit
his receivers only occasionally. Flank-
er Buck Cunningham was closely
guarded throughout the second half
of the game.

 

 

—

The Bears, on the other hand,
came to life as W&L’s fine defensive
unit went flat. Lagdon repeatedly
passed to Hinton for substantial yard-
age and after the first real drive of
the game Lagdon took the ball in
for the score.

The game ended with the Generals
in possession of the ball on Wash-
ington’s 6 yard line. The final score
17-7.

The Generals’ final season record
is 5-4-0, This puts them in a three
way tie for second place along with
Centre College and Washington Uni-
versity.
