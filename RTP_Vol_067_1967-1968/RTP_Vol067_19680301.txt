Washington and Lee’s novice deba-
tors won eleven awards Wednesday
afternoon at Roanoke College’s seven-
school, three-round novice debate
tournament held in Salem. Never be-
fore in the history of W&L have
Washington and Lee debaters won so
many trophies at the same tourna-
ment.

The four man team of Stacy East-
land, Joe Wich, Bill Radigan and

John McCardell won six of six de-
bates to win the tournament wihle
the W&L team of Kevin Baker,

Danny Leonard, Bill Payne and Ken
Walden won five of six debates to
come in in second place. This was
the first time ever that either Walden
or Leonard had been in a debate
either on the high school or the
college level.

Kevin Baker was chosen to top
negative speaker of the tournament,
as well as the top speaker of the
tournament. Stacy Eastland was the
top affirmative speaker in the tourna-
ment, while Bill Radigan was the
secon best negative speaker, and John
McCardell the third best negative
speaker. Joe Wich won an award as
the fourth best affirmative speaker.

Along with the eleven awards that
Washington and Lee won, the remain-
ing eight awards of the tournament
were divided among VMI, University
of Richmond and Bridgewater Col-
lege.

 

Will lie Prokofief “Eighth ‘ Sonata”

Thomas Brockman Schedules Recital

| Concert pianist Thomas Brockman,
well-known to Lexington audiences
from his past appearances here, will
perform the Prokofieff “Eighth So-
nata” as the major work in his re-
cital Wednesday night (March 6).

Brockman will be presented by the
Concert Guild at Lee Chapel. The
concert will begin at 8 p.m.

The program chosen by Brockman
is the same one which won him his
first big success in New York and
which he also played to critical ac-
claim on one of his European tours.

 

Although the Prokofieff sonata,
written during World War HI in Rus-
i, was introduced to the United

| Siates by Vladimir Horowitz, it was
| Brockman who gave it its first per-
| formances in such cities as Vienna,
Berlin, Munich, Amsterdam, Oslo,

Last weekend Andrew Wyndham
and Kevin Baker, both freshmen,
debating in the varsity division of the
Atlantic Coast Conference Debate
Tournament at College Park, Md.,
University of Maryland, won two of
three debates on the affirmative side
of the National Debate Topic to tie
with South Carolina and George
Washington University for second
place in the tournament. Over- all, the}

Wyndham-Baker team came in third
place with a 3-3 record.

At the same time, Tom Baremore
at the University of Pennsylvania
Tournament in Philadelphia tied for
fifth place speaker position out of a
field of over a 100 debaters. This
was remarkable considering that the
Washington and Lee team there lost
five of eight debates in this tour-
nament.

Geology Group
Expands Scope

A new student activity has estab-
lished itself on the Washington and
Lee campus in the form of the Geo-
logical Society. The group's primary
purpose is to allow students who are
interested in geology to discuss var-
ious topics which are not, as of now,
dealed with in class. Composed en
tirely of students who have had at
least three semesters of some form
of geology, the society numbers some
eleven members, the great majority
of whom are geology majors.

Most of the discussions and lec-
tures given are student initiated, with
students choosing certain topics either
relating to their theses or of partic
ular interest to them. As geology is
not a pure science, the discussions
often end up taking the form of
debates, in which the pros and cons
of certain theories are argued.

 

He also will meet with
and faculty members at a
afternoon physics seminar. During
his two-day stay he will meet in-
formally with the students and facul-
ty to discuss curriculum and research
problems in physics

Not Wise. Not Honest.

Back in December the EC voted 7-1 to reject membership
in the Virginia Association of Student Governments (VSAG),
on the grounds that the organization was too new and its aims
as yet undefined; that W&L would have little to say in guiding
its course; and that W&L has so little in common with other
Virginia schools that it would “no doubt gain very little” from

an association with them.

“At the present,”’ wrote EC President Richard Nash in an
article in this paper, ‘the disadvantages appear to far outweigh
the advantages of our joining the Virginia Association of Stu-
dent Governments. However, should the organization, at a
later date, prove to be of potential value and service to Wash-
ington and Lee, we will always have the option of joining then.”
Elsewhere in the same article, he had said, “It would not be
wise to ‘jump in’ without finding out more about the organiza-

tion.”

At the time, we remarked that we thought the EC had
acted in good faith in adopting a ‘‘wait-and-see” attitude. And
at the time, that may have been true. Executive Committee
members Steve Sandler and Danny Leonard had attended the
Fall Conference of VASG, presumably to find out whether
W&L could and should join. Mr. Sandler apparently came
away impressed, and cast the single vote in favor of joining.
Mr. Leonard, although he voted in the negative, suggested
that it wouldn’t hurt to wait and see how the organization de-

veloped.

All of that was well and good. But two weeks ago, on|_

Feb. 17 and 18, VASG held its Winter Conference at the Uni-
versity of Virginia. Sen. William B. Spong Jr. of Virginia was
the guest of honor; guest speakers included W&L’s own dean
of students, Edward C. Atwood, and administrators from
U.Va. and Virginia Tech. Our Executive Committee was in-
vited to send a delegate. No one went. At least one EC member
said he was unaware that there had even been a conference.
We suspect he was not the only one.

The EC is making a serious error. It should have been
apparent back in December that a significant number of
students feel that W&L can benefit from VASG. Whether
deliberately or from apathy, the EC is both arbitrarily ignor-
ing their interests and dishonoring its own promise to con-

tinue investigating.

Sending observers to the conference would have in no
way committed us to anything. Furthermore, it is significant
that of the two EC members who attended the first conference
in the fall, one came back completely in favor of membership,
and the other in favor of at least keeping an eye on the organi-
zation. Perhaps other EC members, if they had bothered to
attend the Winter Conference, could have come back with
similar conclusions—or at least been better able to judge the
organization from first-hand experience.

If, as Mr. Nash has written, “it would not be wise to ‘jump
in’ without finding out more about the organization,”’ it is
also true that it is neither wise nor honest to ignore the organi-
zation’s existence. It is not wise, because it is by no means cer-
tain that W&L would not benefit from membership in VASG.
It is not honest, because the EC is ignoring its promises to

keep an open mind.

Student Body Will Participate
In Mock Convention On May 3, 4

By BOB ENTZMINGER

While in the past months develop-
ments concerning the Mock Conven-
tion have been highly publicized and
its past claims to national recognition
exhumed and retold, most of the
activities surrounding this event have
been performed by a relatively small
number of students. The great ma-
jority of the student body has seen
only the results—i.c., speaker engage-
ments, delegation assignments, etc.

As convention time—May 3 and
4—neurs, the number of active par-
ticipants continue to grow until ulti-
mately the entire student body will
be asked to perform a role—mostly
as delegates to the
convention.

The focal point
of this spiralling
number of people
is, as everybody
knows by now,
Chairman Steve
Saunders. Around
him operates the
Secretariat, eleven
people who oversee
specific tasks nec-
essary to the suc-
cess of the convention,

Jim Lowe is the secretary, and he
handles most of the paper work.
Mike Miles is chairman of the fi-
nance committee, a major problem
at present. Part of this difficulty
should be alleviated by the Journal,
a collection of features in the midst
of huge quantities of expensive ads
(well, that’s the aim of Editor Ron
Kessler, at any rate), Kim Ladewig,
Siexe Meixner, and their committee
will have the unenviable task of

Overcoming WAL's lack of universal

 

Saunders

 

renown is Ed Allen's specific job, As
director of publicity he has been work-
ing closely with John Hughes of In-
formation Services to assure Maximum
news coverage for each new occur-
rence. Val McWhorter, director of
protocol, is to keep the visiting digni-
taries as contented as possible and
relatively shielded from mobs, over-
ripe fruit, and such.

Tom Baremore, director of state
delegations, and his small staff are
responsible for seeing that the state
delegations behave as they ought,
which means that he collects monthly
reports concerning progress and di-
vision of duties within each delega-
tion from each state chairman, It is
he who must pressure the chairmen
so that they in turn will make de-
mands upon the individual delegates.
Basically each chairman is to de-
termine, along with the Secretariat,
whom his delegation’s counterpart in
Miami will support, To assure the ac
curacy in prediction for which the
WAL convention is noted, Staff Keegin
has been named chairman of the Re-
publican National Committee for the
Mock Convention. He has been main
taining a liaison between convention
heaquarters and the county chair
men. He is responsible for polling the
latter, and on that basis he will ad
vise the chairmen about voting. The
chairmen, at least on the first ballots,
will control the voting of their dele
gates.

The individual delegates will be al
lowed more freedom concerning the
proposed platform, which is being
composed by a committee of about
40 headed by Drew Colclough. In
addition to this nucleus, each delega
tion has a liaison to this committee,

Mock Convention History,

Part II

 

By PAT AREY
Mock Editor
“All of Asiatic Europe, as one man,
has risen up within the last few
years and demanded the rights of
local self-government, and this is
Democracy...”

“Today... we see the spectacle of
a divided Republican Party, caused
by the old ship of state striking not
an iceberg (It was the Year of the
Titanic) but the great rock of Gibral-
tar...” so chortled the first issue of
The Democrat.

It was 1912. The second W&L
Mock Convention again would name
the students’ Democratic candidate
for President.

Both of the national parties were
divided over potential nominees.

President William Howard Taft
was dismissed by the mock conven-
tion’s newspaper, The Democrat,
with the sentence “Nobody loves a
fat man.” Theodore Roosevelt was

Judson Harmon

addressed as such: “Hail to the Chief.
Chiefest of his own ambition and
estimation... A vulture feeding on
the carron of open notoriety and cal-
lous abuse...”

Leading Democrats included Wood-
row (The Collegian’s Candidate) Wil-
son, Governor of New Jersey; Champ
(“the Democratic Party has more
lives than all
Island”) Clark, Speaker of the House
of Representatives; Judson (“he is
too conservative and is almost re-

actionary”) Harmon, Governor of
Ohio; and Oscar Underwood of
Alabama.

Said one Wilson supporter, “This
is an age when it is a joy to live,
and be a Democrat.”

After some question as to if there
would even be a mock convention,
sponsorship was undertaken by The
Forum, WA&L’s newly formed civic
club. The convention was called for
Tuesday, May 14.

Preconvention Maneuvers

Gov. Wilson and Speaker Clark
were the leading candidates. Clubs
had formed supporting all the Dem-
ocratic candidates and competition
was high.

Great debates raged in the Cre-
dentials committee over delegations,
Fraud was alleged in the Missouri
delegation, Clark's home state. It
seems, reported the Democrat, that
the delegation chairman called a
Clandestine meeting of Clark sup-
porters, had himself elected perman-

delegates throughout the whole of

The chairman ruled them invalid
He had the votes; the Wilson men
were casi oul, so to speak, and the
chairman was last reported disappear-
ing ‘down the road,’

 

Motion To Adjourn

Most notable of the first session
on Tuesday was the entrance of the
Kentucky delegation. The perman-
hent convention chairman was speak
ing. “The Kentucky delegation enter
ed the hall with a large banner on
which was pictured Champ Clark and
the things for which the State is
justly famous.”

The chairman was also given the
power to fine any delegate a wim)
not to exceed one dollar for any/|
“undue disorder.”

The platform was adopted, calling
for, among other things, election of

ing campaign expenses, adoption of
a parcel post, anda graduated income
tax.

Nominations were now in order.

tion denied.

been slated for days to present the
name of his candidate to the con-
vention, Amid the wild thunder of

forever’.

A second motion for adjourn-
ment was made, and ignored.

“And in the noise that rocked the
whole chapel and was heard far
over the campus, Col. Dow went
back to his seat...” One over-zeal-
ous New Jersey follower led “nine
rahs for Wilson.”

The Clark men, not to be counted
out: “the huge form of P. C. Rogers
appeared out of the confusion and
his voice was heard above the din
calling the W&L yell for Champ

The first ballot was called. It
finished with 311 votes for Wilson,
227 for Clark. Under the rules, 2/3
of the votes were needed to nominate.

As the second call began, Alabama
nominated Oscar Underwood. Utah
and Tennessee seconded. In the New

revolts spring up, but the chairmen
held their delegations in line for
Wilson and Clark. The second bal-
lot finished with Wilson, 327; Clark,
184; Underwood, 32.

At the fourth session that night,
the chairman pointed out to the
delegates that the convention must
elect a nominee as the faculty had
allowed only one day without classes
for the convention.

Few changes came on the third
ballot: Wilson, 318, Clark 199; Un-
derwood, 29.

A trend seemed to start for Clark
on the fourth ballot with 225 votes
for Clark; Wilson down to 202, and
Underwood handging on to his 29,

Clark men,

The convention plodded into a
fifth ballot. No surprises seemed
coming, even when Nebraska nomi-
nated Gov. Harmon. The switch came
when New York went over to Har-
mon with 45 votes. Pennsylvania fol-
lowed, then Virginia. Vermont tried
to shift the convention to Mayor
Gaynor of New York City, but no
chance.

Tennessee then moved to change
its votes to Harmon, and it was all
over. With many delegations recast-
ing their votes, Harmon won with
375 of 546 votes.

In the closing moments, the vice

| presidential candidate was nominated.

Sen. Robert L. Owen of Oklahoma
(a W&L Alumnus) won over Oscar
Underwood of Alabama, Foss of
Massachusetts, and John W. Davis
of West Virginia (who would carry
the convention another day).

The motion to adjourn was made

 

as delegates left the hall.

riculum, the “pass-fail” system, after
one semester of Operation has re-
ceived the overwhelming appoval of
the faculty.

Under “pass-fail” a junior or sen-
ior may take one free elective a se-
mester without receiving a letter
grade and still receive credit for
the course provided he passes it. The
system, which is in use in a num-
ber of colleges throughout the coun-
try, was proposed by the Executive
Committee and was approved by the
faculty in the spring of last year.

Last Semester 54 students took
courses pass-fail. Judging from the
reactions of a number of faculty
members in various departments
questioned this week, the new pro-
gram seems to be a success,

The main objective of the program
was to encourage students to branch
out and take courses which they have
been afraid to take under normal
circumstances.

As English professor Robert Hunt-
ley said, “Most of those who took it
in my class did not want to compete
with English majors.”

He said the program is “getting
you back to the idea of a liberal
arts college. Nobody wants to ex-
pose himself today, they tend to stay
in their own narrow fields. Now this
brings a lot of guys out of the weeds.”

One of the major fears of the pro-
gram was that students would take
advantage of it not to work hard,
however, this does not seem to have
been justified.

Professors found that most stu-
dents would have made A’s or B's
had they taken the course for grades.
There were a few instances in which
pass-fail students made F’s, but this
was the exception.

Only one professor expressed dis-
appointment with the system.

“I'm in favor of the effort to take
pressure off grades,” he said, “but
I'm not sure this is the way to do it.”

He called the program nothing
more than “a faint effort to tinker
with the system.”

At any event, the program is be-
coming entrenched in the W&L cur-
riculum, This semester 88 students
are taking courses pass-fail, more
than a sixty per cent increase over
last semester.

‘Granma,’ Official Newspaper Of Cuba
Sent Gratis To US Campus Publications

By MIKE DUNN

Granma: Weekly Review of the
Official Organ of the Central Commit-
tee of the Communist Party of Cuba.
Published at Havana, Cuba, in Eng-
lish, French, and Spanish. English
edition available free, Ring-tum Phi
office.

Those of you who thrive on Marx,
or whose red-bound copies of The
Thought of Chairman Mao Tse-Tung
occupy a place of honor on the book
shelf next to Nerton’s Anthology of
English Literature, will greet with
pleasure the arrival on this campus
of the official organ of the Party in
Cuba—a newspaper whose views pro-

vide a refreshing alternative to the |
drab British, French, German, Rus-

sian, and American periodicals given
official recognition in McCormick Li-
brary.

Granma arrives cach week free of
cost at newspaper offices of most
camuses in the United States, where,
unfortunately, it is seldom given due
attention or any wide circulation, |
hope by this review to rectify the
situation.

Granma’s overall layout and de-
sign represents the best in revolution-
ary journalism, utilizing an artisti-
cally pleasing red-black-gray color
scheme. Only a few short articles
occupy each page, allowing an easy
digestion of important facts. For
example, on Page One of the Febru-
ary 18, 1968 (“Year of the Heroic
Guerrilla”) issue we find three articles,
one of which is worth quoting in its
entirety:

“EMIL BODNARAS... VISIT.
ING OUR COUNTRY: Comrade
Emil Bodnaras, member of the
Permanent Presidium of the Cen-
Committee Communist

Thus does Granma rebuke = the

 

 

so much for the front-page news,
General news can be found on Page
3. Cinemaddicts will regret having
missed the world premiere of The
Adventures of Juan Quin Quin in
Cienfuegos last week.

Anti-imperialists, however, will be
glad to know that:

“The recent victories obtained
by the PAFL fulfill the pledge taken
by the entire Vietnamese people in
response to the death of heroic
Major Che Guevara.”

This statement was made by Com-
rade Hoang Bich Son, representative
of the National Front for the Libera-
tion of South Vietnam in Cuba.

The features are even more interest-
ing, if possible. “A GUERRILLA
DOCTOR WILL ALWAYS REMAIN
A GUERRILLA DOCTOR,” for ex-
ample. The most important article
begins on page 4: “TOWARD A
PRESS REFLECTING THE REVO.
LUTION’S STATURE.” The author
takes a frank, open look at the goals
of the socialist organ—and the pos-
sible pitfalls awating it.

Not the least of these pitfalls is
the conspiracy inevitably directed
against the publication of Truth in
the imperialist countries, As the
author so rightly observes:

enemies try to give a dis.
torted meaning to what we do or
not publish, or to the form
which we publish something.

(He adds elsewhere, “Sometimes
we believe that it is enough to use a
‘political slogan’ with exaltation, or
just repeat that “The Imperialists are
bad, and the revolutionaries are good,’
until it becomes tiresome. In many
cases nothing could be less political,
so false and unproductive as the use
of the so-called ‘Political slogan’.”)

In short, we need “a profoundly

The revoluntionary press can even
use the imperialists’ Own newspapers
and books against them, explains the
writer—Truman Capote’s In Cold
Blood, for example.

“This sordid story of crime and
violence, taken straight from real life,
is a faithful portrait of the inner
workings of imperialist society .. .
This work and others of its kind
should be useful to our literary critics
and journalists in general in writing
intersting articals which not only
draw conclusions about imperialism
but move the reader as well,”

By ROY CARLTON

Amid mass confusion, wild cos-
tumes and cars of every description,
Washington and Lee’s first automo-
bile rally will begin at 2:45 tomor-
row afternoon. Messrs. Roger Clarke
and Bob Gastrock have been work-
ing hard for several weeks to shape
an event that could very well be-
come a spring rite on the level of
Goshen or Natural Bridge. Should
this initial rally meet with a good
response, another one will be plan-
ned for sometime in March with
several more to follow after Spring
Vacation.

Because of the time and record-
breaking difficulties, this first rally
will be limited to some fifty cars.
Positions for the start will be award-
ed on a first-come-first served basis.
However, if there are a_ significant
number of cars above the limit, a
second rally will be held tomorrow

 

The material Coach Szlasa has to
work with is abundant and experienc-
ed. Returning lettermen include goalie
Dave Johnson; Midfielders Terry
Griffin, Bart Goodwin, Ralph Schen-
kel, Clark Carter, Hugh Baugher and
Jay Merriwether; defensemen Charlie

 

Stewart, Harold Stowe, Ned Coslet,
and Holmes Raker; and attackmen,
Chip Chew, Jim Chance, Tom Pitt-
man, and Joe Wich.

In addition to all the returning
varsity lettermen, Szlasa is optimistic |
about the chances of 8 returning B
team members; John Miller, Stan|
Lilse, Tom Mullenix, Ben Schwarts, |
Landon Quinn, Howard Capito
John Thomas, and Dick Capron.

There are four outstanding fresh-
men prospect out, also. They include
Bill Brumback, Frank Brooks, Jay
Knupp, and Whit Morrill. Other
strong freshmen are Bill Ingersol,
goalie, who did a fine job in the box
lacrosse game against U.Va. a few
weeks ago; Bob Radcliffe, Bill Bal-

lard, and Rocky Kimball. Bob Frost
and Tom Groton, both ineligible last
year, are also potential starters.

The team will have five unscored, |

Hofstra on March 19, These will in
clude back-to-back home games with
Adelphi and Ohio State and a pair

As the two post-season basketball
tourneys continue their bidding for
participants, the sports fan can see
a definite disparity between the teams
chosen for the NCAA tourney and
selected for New York’s NIT.

Conference champs among major
college designated teams automiatical-
ly get a bid from the NCAA of-
ficials, who will then fill out their
field with at-large picks. The Nation-
al Invitational Tournament, _ then,
loses some of the powers that might |
produce a more exciting match-up.
It is left with the independents, and
often, not even the high ranking free-
lancers, such as Houston's Cougers.

Last year’s NIT showed this graph-
ically. Of the four semi-final teams,

standing, while the other three had
made only brief flirtations with any
sort of national prominence. Al-
though the tournament produced some
fine basketball and outstanding per-
formances of such stars as Walter
Frazier, Bob Lloyd and George Stone,
many factors kept it from being a
“national” tourney able to compete
with the NCAA.

One is the predominance of north-
eastern based teams found in the
NIT; this naturally produces fan sup
port for the tournament. However,
when southern, midwestern, or west-
eran teams come to New York to
display their wares, their victories
become rather meaningless if gained
at the expense of easter independ-
ents with 19-9 records.

Independents’ Plight

sistant Rallymaster Gastrock. Both he
and Rallymaster Clarke expect to
see a number of drivers wearing gog-
gles and scarfs or whatever they
can find. Gastrock continue to say
that “We're not limiting the number
of people per car...we're hoping
that any advantage that drivers may
have in extra passengers will be offset
by the added confusion.”

because most independents can’t hope
to secure the rugged regular season
schedules that would hone them for
the March tourneys.,

Now, to take the previous state-
ments and make the iron-clad declara-
ration that no independent belongs on
the same court with, say, a Big Sky
Conference champ is only a little
short of ludicrous. Loyola of Chi-
cago’s victory over Cincinnati a few
years back and Houston’s strong posi-
tion, not to mention St. Bonaventure,
this year speak well for the individual
independent team once and a while.

be a race. In fact, recommended
speeds will be suggested well below
the speed limits of the roads. Also
larger penalties will be given to those
arriving at check-points early than to
those coming in late.

The rally will be conducted ac-
cording to three variables: time,
speed, and milage. Before beginning,
each car will be given instructions.
The route will not be given, just
two variables from which the navi-
gator must direct the driver. For
instance, the directions might read,
“travel three miles at thirty miles
per hour and turn right at the red
barn.” From these instructions the
driver must figure where to turn
and be careful to arrive on time.

and he will be called in for hearings
on proposed planks when issues be-
gin to crystallize. The only restriction
on individual freedom here is the
requirement that each delegate vote
as he feels his counterpart will do in
Miami.

In addition to this scholarly prepara-
tion, the delegations must also pro-
vide for the color and revelry of a
real convention. The arrival of beauty
queens and dignitaries and favorite
con campaigns, as well as decorating
a headquarters (or at least hanging out
an apparent sign), will play a large
part, but the parade is to be the
most elaborate element in the super-
ficial trappings. Parade Director Bob
McLaughlin has been working with
a float director from each of the 53
delegations—the states, Puerto Rico,

 

the Virgin Islands, and the District
of Columbia—to assure a minimum |
of problems. For instance, in 1964}
nine floats were left half completed |
as the parade began. |

Much of this is expensive, and the |
chairmen must rely heavily upon their |
delegations not only for the man-|
power to build floats and OCCUPY |
headquarters, but for sources of reve- |
nue. Moreover, each state has been
assigned an advertising quota for the}

be free for the picking. This would
allow the New York group to get|
whatever good conference second, or |
even third place finishers, in addi- |
tion to all the good independents. |

Then, rather than proclaiming an)
NCAA and NIT winner, why not a|
super-game pitting the victors? This |
would seem to solve more than)
one problem. The tournaments would
be of more even strength, and the
chances of more Loyolas enhanced.
