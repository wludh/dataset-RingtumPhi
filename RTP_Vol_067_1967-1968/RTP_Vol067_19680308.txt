Platform Committee Chairman
Schedules Hearings For April

By JOHN HUGHES

The platform committee for the
1968 Mock Republican Convention
wil conduct several open hearings
early next month,

The formation of the committee
and the hearings are further efforts
to make the W&L mock political
event as authentic as possible.

Under the chairmanship of Drew
Colclough, a senior law student from
Arlington, the committee has been
busy contacting Republican leaders
in Washington and across the coun-
try, getting their views on what the
platform should contain.

“We will try to write a platform
which reflects the true spirit of the
Republican Party on the major issues,”
commented Colclough, “and a_plat-
form on which the nominee could
run.” Former Oklahoma Gov. Henry
Bellmont will present the platform to
the opening session of the Mock
Convention May 3.

“What we need,” said Colclough,
“is for the people in the party— not
only the governors and senators, but
the real convention delegates, the
people in contact with the people back
home—to take the time to jot down
their views on what the major issues
are, and what their thinking is on
them.”

At the same time, the Republican
Party can benefit, since Colclough’s

Professor From Brown U.

Will Present Talk Tonight;
Physicist Here Mar. 14

The Department of Physics pre-
sents Dr. E. A. Mason, Professor of
Physics at Brown University, tonight
at 8 o'clock in New Science 201. He
wil speak on “Molecular Rainbows
and Glories—Waves and Particles.”
rhe talk is open to the public.

Thursday, March 14th, there will
be a physics seminar featuring Dr.
W. D. Whitehead, Director of Center
For Advance Studies at the University
of Virgina, who will speak on “A
New View of X-Ray lonization of
Gases.”

For the last five years Dr. White-
head has been using an_ electron
synchrotron to investigate experiment-
ally the interaction of photons with
nuclei. These experiments give in-
teresting information about the struc-
ture of highly excited states and about
shapes of various nuclei. He is in-
terested in the production of neutrons
by interaction of photons with nuclei.
He has also been working with mul-
tiple ionization processes in atoms and
the lifetimes of states in ionized
atoms.

There will be a coffee at 4:30 p.m.
to be followed by the seminar from

 

 

5-6 p.m. Both will take place in
New Science 201.

W ycherley’s “The Country Wife”

committee plans to send a copy of
its platform to every delegate to the
real GOP convention in Miami.

The Republican views will be pre-
sented at the hearings, set for April
10-11, through the student spokes-
men for the various state delegations.

“Anyone who wants to testify may
contact me at Mock Convention head-
quarters in Lexington,” Colclough
said, ‘by mail, in person or by tele-
phone. If they like, they can submit
statesments in writing to the com-
mittee.”

The main emphasis of Colclough
and his 11-man committee is to draft
a platform that will closely parallel
the real thing. “It’s got to be a credit-
able and professional document,” he
said.

English Department Offers
Prose And Poetry Awards

By FRANK ROSE

The Washington and Lee English
department is offering two awards in
creative writing this spring. They are
the Mahan Awards for poetry and
prose and the Academy of American
Poets award in poetry.

The Mahan Awards consist of two
freshman prose awards, one sopho-
more prose award, one junior prose
award, and one verse award open to
anyone in the College except seniors.
The poetry award is given to the
best poem or group of poems sub-
mitted to the English department.

The Mahan Awards carry a $100
exemption from college fees for the
year following the one in which the
award is made, or $60 in cash. The
winners will be announced during
Commencement in June. The winner
of the poetry award will receive a
$100 prize.

According to Dr. Severn Duvall,
head of the English department, the
Mahan Awards were set up “to en-
courage and reward creative writing
among undergraduates. An endow-

As Convention Grand Marshal

Tennessee Congressman William E. Brock III will serve
as parade grand marshal at Washington and Lee University’s

Mock Republican Convention

here May 3-4.

Rep. Brock, a Washington and Lee alumnus, will ride in
the place of honor at the head of the traditonal convention
parade on Friday afternoon, May 3.

The parade, featuring floats from*—-—-——-

dozens of state delegations and re-
splendent with state beauty queens
and bands, will wind through Lex-
ington’s downtown streets to Doremus
Gymnasium, site of the mock political
event,

Rep. Brock has had one other previ-
ous experience with the Washington
and Lee’s mock convention. As a
student here in 1952, he was a mem-
ber of the Tennessee delegation to
the convention which nominated
Dwight Eisenhower for the presi-
dency.

Rep. Brock, a conservative, was
elected to Congress in 1962, the first
Republican to represent Tennessee's
3rd District in 42 years. He was re-
elected in 1964 and again in 1966.

A businessman (he is a vice presi-
dent and director of the Brock Candy
Co. founded by his grandfater) and
civic leader, he was chosen two years
ago as Chattanooga's “Young Man
of the Year.”

A native of Chattanooga, Rep.
Brock attended McCallie School and
received his B.S. in commerce from
Washington and Lee in 1953, He
served 34 years of active duty in
the Far East as a naval officer.

The Congressman’s father, W. E.
Brock Jr., also is a Washington and
Lee alumnus (Class of 1925) and
is a former president and Board
chairman of Brock Candy Co.

out Virginia this season by the Vir-
ginia Museum Theatre Arts System.
The first two productions were an
all-professional staging of Moliere’s
“The School for Wives” and The
Bailes Espanoles of Jose Molina.

and Juliet,” and Thomas’ “Hamlet”;
songs from plays by Shakespeare;
and, adding a contemporary elment
melodies from Cole Porter's “Kiss
Me Kate,” the Broadway musical
based on “The Taming of the Shrew.”

Remarks On VASG

Although the Tuesday Edition’s remarks
on the subject of the Virginia Association of
Student Governments (VASG) contained
much that was true and pertinent, we fear they
have missed the point.

It is quite inaccurate to suggest that we are
possessed by a “passion for joining” the
VASG. We are aware that the EC did not
originally reject membership back in Decem-
ber without having what seemed to them good
reasons for doing so. We are also aware that
those reasons still exist. What we question is
whether those reasons are so strong that they
absolutely preclude joining VASG; or, con-
versely, that VASG offers so few advantages
that it is not worth the trouble of investigat-
ing further. So far, neither point has been
proved to our satisfaction. And there are very
good reasons for maintaining an active interest
in the organization. We’ve heard plenty of
arguments lately in favor of maintaining our
splendid isolation. “Washington and Lee does
not have a great deal in common with other
colleges in Virginia,” runs the argument. “Call
it snobbishness if you will (we prefer ‘pride’) :
but we have, in our name, something to pro-
tect that a lot of schools simply don’t.”

In last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi, however,
there appeared an article which, although its
writer did not intend it as an answer to such
an argument, nevertheless has bearing upon
it. The writer, a foreign student, remarked:

“Compared with what was going on in
Frankfurt University when I left it last sum-
mer, the W&L campus appears like a grave
yard; but I know this is not typical for Ameri-
can campuses...

The Shenandoah Valley seems to be some-
thing like a ‘glass-cave’ where (conservative)
‘thought’ is protected or rather rendered
immune from the outside world and its chal-
lenges. In simple words: the quiescence of
this campus is its basic characteristic.

“This state of affairs is reflected in the
mentality of most students ... While trying to
find out the reasons for that I got mostly
one stereo-typical answer (which sounded like
an excuse) : we are conservative. Conservatism
is an excuse, an excuse for non-existent politi-
cal ideas which are worth discussing . . .”

* *

We can’t escape the feeling that the de-
fense of our “good name“ is only another
excuse for protection and immunity from “the
outside world and its challenges.”

We are not suggesting now, and have never
suggested, that VASG is the only means by
which W&L can make a step toward some
kind of involvement. The disadvantages of
membership might outweigh the advantages,
just as the EC argues. Other organizations
might be more suited to our needs, But VASG
membership might be the right step, and we
will never know unless positive action is taken
to weigh its advantages and disadvantages. It
is not enough to say, “The VASG must come
to us, not us to them.” We not only must
come to them, to look them over and watch
their development, but we must also keep an

bees *

eye on similar organizations and problems to
which we may be invited in future.

* *

All of which leads us to approve heartily
of the news that VASG’s president—on his
own initiative—plans to visit W&L within the
next two weeks for the purpose, presumably,
of presenting his organization’s case to the

BC.

Give Us Our Saturdays!

Now that the proponents of the five-day
class week have had their say, may we raise
at least one voice in favor of keeping the
six-day week just as we have it? Frankly, the
idea of crowding the same amount of work
into a lesser period of time with longer classes
and a longer class day does not appeal to us;
and we can hardly believe that most students,
if they really thought about the alternatives,
would prefer a five-day week. (Can you
imagine getting up at 7:45 some Monday
morning—class starts in fifteen minutes—and
trying to sort out what week-block it is, and
what time-block section B falls in today—or
is it tomorrow? Can you imagine getting up
at 7:45 at all?)

So far, we’ve seen nothing in all the argu-
ments for the five-day class week that indicates
its superiority to the present one. In fact, its
backers cheerfully admit “there is no educa-
tional benefit to be derived from the change.”
They argue that, on the other hand, “it is not
necessarily true that the change would be dis-
advantageous.” Well, maybe not. But after
all, the burden of proof lies on those who
want to make the change, not on those who
would like to keep the much simpler schedule
we have now.

Faculty Disinterest

And while we’re on the subject of polls,
it has come to our attention that barely 40%
of the faculty polled concerning their opinions
on the war in Vietnam (see lead article on
this page) bothered to return the forms.

Each form was delivered by campus mail
to the 145 members of the faculty. It was
accompanied by a request to return the forms
via campus mail to a certain professor’s mail-
box. Intra-campus mail need only be placed
in an envelope and addressed; no stamp is
necessary; it is altogether without cost. And
if the location of an envelope poses a problem,
the form could simply be folded, stapled, and
addressed on the back.

Which brings us to the point: why was
there only 40% return? Accusations of apathy
generally spew forth from the faculty to the
student body; in this case, the student body
turned out in droves (80%) to respond to
a poll on Saturday classes which only two years
ago received a response of 50%.

Thus, due to the fact that 60%, of the fac-
ulty proved too lazy to answer this poll, the
only conclusion that can be drawn concerning
the results is that the results are inconclusive.

Only 40 Per Cent Respond

 

Faculty Shows Anti-War Sentiments

Forty-two per cent of the Wash-

have responded to a poll taken by
the Friday Edition of the Ring-tum
Phi concerning their opinions on the
war in Vietnam and the draft. Both
the ages and departments of these
answering the poll were requested
on the confidential forms.

Of the forty-two percent respond-
ing, 58.9 per cent answered that they
were opposed to the war in Vietnam,
while 17.8 per cent considered them-
selves to be proponents of the war;
23.3 per cent were either undecided,
or checked “Other.”

The results which follow are based
upon the number of respondants
answering the individual question
(some did or could not answer cer-
tain questions):

Do you believe that a majority
of the people of South Vietnam
support the National Liberation
Front (Viet Cong) or the Siagon

Dear Sir:

The faculty has indicated by its
insistance upon deferred rush that the
fraternity system at WA&L must be
modified. The faculty is probably cor-
rect in its analysis that the system is
over-emphasized, but they are mis-
taken in thinking that a deferred rush
would correct the situation,

What the fraternity system needs is
competition where it is strongest:
competition in social life. What they
appeal to are social aspects of a stu-
dents life. A fraternity is (1) a place
to party, (2) a source of transporta-
tion, (3) a source of dates, (4) a
change of food. What a fraternity is
not, at least here at WAL, is a
mystical bond linking certain people;
nor is it a place of intellectual stimula-
hon.

They are the only social life at

By JERRY PERLMAN

Friday Sports Editor

It’s been three weeks since this
columnist broke the Eleventh Com-
mandment—‘“Thou shalt not
(choose your favorite vice)—and pro-
posed that Washington and Lee
seriously consider withdrawing _ its
membership from the College Athletic
Conference. Since then, conference
championships have been held in three
sports, and, jumpin’ Doremus: the
Five-Star Generals have picked up
two firsts and a second place, plac-
ing them firmly atop the standings in
the race for the “funky funky rail-
road bell.”

So what? Not to take anything
away from the W&L athletes who
participated, the victories meant about
as much as the conference itself. The
basketball win did not messrs. Neer,

What are the alternatives to CAC
membership? Where can a small all
men’s college nestled in the Shenan-
doah Valley find true athletic happi-
ness? Several factors limit choices,
but the alternatives are there, and,
as the old cliche goes, “nothing
ventured, .. .”

Mason-Dixon Proposal

It has been suggested that Wash-
ington and Lee find and apply for
membership in an already-established
conference that does not have the
drawbacks of the CAC. This would
mean a conference of sufficient size,
playing an adequate number of sports,
and with schools in close enough

Mound Strength And Overall Depth Vital Recuse

As Lyles Sends Charges Through Opening Drills

By THUNDER THORNTON

Coach Joe Lyles has welcomed a
large turn-out and the warm skies of
the past week in preparing for the
Generals’ upcoming baseball season.
Commenting on the impending sched-
ule, Coach Lyles noted that all the
opponents will be tough, and that
today he could not say “which ones
we can win.” But the consensus is
that the Generals can improve some-
what on last spring's record.

The candidates have been drilling
outdoors this week and the embryo
of a lineup is beginning to form.
Coach Lyles has a steady co-captain,
Tom Mitchell, to build around, and
several other returnees. With Mitchell
in center and last year’s leading hitter,
Jim Wilson, flanking him in left, the
outfield has two strong performers.

In the infield, steady sophomore
John Nolan can be counted on at
third base, and Gil Fitzhugh, who has
played previously but sat out last
year, is trying a new position. Behind
the plate will be Jack Baizley, who
played well as a freshman last spring.

New Blood
The only other real experience is
accounted for in pitchers Bill Ras-
mussen, the other co-captain, and
Lee Halford. However, new talent is
ready to fill the gaps. Transfer student

Kessler Pilots R-t P Entry To Third

 

Price, Chadwick Winners

Of ‘Wonders’

The “Green Gourd” was hurtling
down Route 11 at breakneck speed.
Tense thoughts flashed through the
minds of driver and navigator alike.
They had already lost precious min-
utes by making two wrong turns,
How far would they be off from the
correct time?

It was approximately 6:30 p.m. on
March 2, 1968, when Brian Price and
his navigator Joe Chadwick drove
across the finish line to make W&L
history. They had just won the first
“Seven Wonders of Rockbridge” auto

rally, although they weren't even
aware they had finished at all. Fortu-
nately, they spied assistant Rally-

master Bob Gastrock waving them
down at the hidden finish line, and
their weatherbeaten Plymouth Valiant
ground to a halt.

Price, wearing a white mechanic's
suit and pilot’s cap ‘a la Snoopy,
climbed out of the car to hear the
bad news. How many cars had come
in before theirs? Rallymaster Roger
Clarke then broke the news. The
Price-Chadwick team was the only
one to have finished, and was only a
few minutes off the correct time. As
time ticked away, and
waited for the also-rans, Clarks and
Gastrock realized something was a-

miss. Only one other car managed to!

finish, that of Stafford Keegin, a law
student, and his wife. Another car,
driven by Ring-tum Phi staffer Ron
Kessler along with Mark Eaker, was
awarded third after finishing in the
wrong spot.

The problem came at the last
turn. The instructions told the drivers
to head north at an intersection. Be-
cause only one car had a compass,
and all the cars expected the rally to
end at Clarke's DU house, they all
took the road into Lexington. Need-
less to say, it was the wrong road.
The Goeff Kuhn-Tom Mullenix team,
the one car with a compass, had
bowed out of the event on the second

The keynote session will convene
at 4:00 p.m. Highlighting the prelimi-
naries is a welcoming speech by Mayor
Douglas Brady, presumably for the
purpose of acquainting visitors with
the wonders of “world-famous Rock-
bridge County.”

The report of the Committee on
Credentials is likely to stir the first
controversy (provided someone doesn’t

take exception to the National
Anthem.) The Convention will vote
on challenges made against any

delegation—one vote per state.

Sometime in the midst of the de-
tailed proceedings, Gov. Claude Kirk
will deliver the keynote address, after
which the convention will formally
elect as “permanent officers” the
people who have been running it
all along.

After a break for supper, the plat-
form session will convene at 7:15

autonomously and debate specific

The CAC: Getting Out
Can Be Half The Fun
For Washington and Lee

(Continued on page 3)

(Roanoke and Old Dominion in par-
ticular) and others, for various rea-
sons, are thinking about leaving the
group. It would be riduculous for
WAL to consider petitioning for mem- |
bership until the Mason-Dixon in-|
sures its own existence.

Another suggestion that is making
the rounds is the formation of a
band-new, all Virginia conference.
This idea has much appeal through-
out the state, but nothing concrete has
been done. Remembering the difficul-
ties Washington and Lee has been
having with the Virginia Intercoll-
legiate Soccer Association (VISA),
which we were instrumental in found-
ing, | would caution the University
to proceed slowly with this idea, not
committing ourselves until others do
the same, and not before all the
schools involved have dropped their
previous conference obligations.

For The Time Being

The final proposition is, I feel, the
best one to follow at the present time.
Washington and Lee should drop
from the CAC and become, at least
for the time being, an independent
school. This would in no way affect
our athletic schedules, since, except
for football, CAC considerations do
not at present enter into regular sea-
son scheduling. As an independent,
we could “shop around,” bide our
time, and, if it were decided that
membership in a conference was de-
sired, find the one that best suited
our athletic needs and aspirations, and
apply for admission. It's been four-
teen years since Washington and Lee
was a member of a “real” conference.
A little more waiting won't hurt until
a worthy successor to the pre-1954
days is found,

Such an innovation in the conven-

What ARE
W&L Freshmen
Thinking About

(Continued from page 2)
working together.

 

Q. If you were able to change one
thing about the University, what
would you like to change?

Once again it is impossible to list
all the responses, but the ideas that
had substantial backing should be
mentioned, By substantial backing I
mean those that were mentioned by
more than 30 per cent of the people
interviewed,

More liberal academic requirements
for both science and non-science stu-
dents was continually brought up.
Many freshmen felt that students |
seeking a degree in history, political |
science, English, or like courses should
not have to take the same math and
science course as a pre-med or science
major. By the same token, science
students should not have to take the
same English or history courses as
the people majoring in those fields.
For those students whose major is
undecided, the option of taking regu-
lar freshman courses in all subjects
should remain.

A trimester system was also a fa-
vorite topic for discussion. Almost
half of the freshmen interview ex-
pressed an interest in a system in
which exams would be before Christ-
mas holidays, and in which there
would possibly be a period of inde-
pendent study, Examples of other uni-
versities which are attempitng this
were cited, and there seemed to be
a great deal of support for such a
system.

 

| tions, and a long list of other not-

| More effective fund-raising was of

prime concern to many freshmen.
| Most freshmen seemed to realize the
| great possibilities for expansion and
| improvements of the university if only

 

 

there was more financial support from
| the alumni and other interested parties.
Other changes suggested by fresh-
men included abolishment of Satur-
day classes, more lenient dorm regula-

quite-so-important items.

Probably the most important thing
shown by the freshman response to
these and many other questions is
the significant awareness and con-
cern for Washington and Lee's future
that has been demonstrated. For the
most part, the freshmen have not
succumbed to the feeling of apathy
which seems to have become em-
bedded in the majority of their elder
classmates.

Next week freshman ideas about
specific features on campus now and
in the future will be presented as they
were given to me in response to cer-
tain questions, These ideas should
prove interesting to both students and

response of the audience to his pro-|

man was called back to the piano
four times. The selections for his

acterizes this convention,

While all these preliminaries re-
quire a great deal of preparation by
a great many people, obviously the
overriding concern of the convention
is predicting correctly the Republican
candidate for President. Nominations
for the nominee will be taken Friday
night amid small riots, “spontaneous
demonstrations,” and other such dig-
nified ceremonies which ordinarily
surround these weighty decisions on
a national level.

Balloting, which is to be strictly
controlled by state chairmen, will
occur in both the Saturday sessions.
After a nominee for President is de-
cided upon, the anti-climactic busi-
ness of choosing his running mate
will close the convention, and dele-
gates will then be free to celebrate
or release excess energies and frustra-
tions over lost causes.

The winning Price-Chadwick team

everybody else. After searching the
town for a finish line, they turned
around and retraced their steps to
the previous intersection. This time
they made the correct guess.

Only twenty-eight cars enterted the
rally, and as a result, there is some
doubt as to whether another will be
held. Officials Clarke and Gastrock
