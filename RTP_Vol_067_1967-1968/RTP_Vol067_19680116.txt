Ryder, Duchin, And Five
Entertain For Fancy Dress

Fancy Dress, one of the most popu-
lar and most famous party weekends
in the South, will take place this
year on February 2-3. Highligthing
the weekend will be the Friday after-
noon cocktail party, the Fancy Dress
Ball Friday evening, and an evening
concert Saturday.

The cocktail party will take place
in the basement of the Mayflower
Motel from 4 to 6 p.m., and the
Parliaments and the Fabulous Five
will provide their always popular
brand of entertainment.

rhe Parliaments had one of the
top soul records of 1967 with their
release entitled “I Wanna Testify.”
Refreshments will be either a variety
of mixed drinks or delightful Play-
boy Punch directly from Hugh Hefner
& Co, in Chicago.

Topping off the afternoon festivi-
ties will be an enticing ‘suprise’ from
Roanoke which should be well worth
everyone’s undivided attention.

 

Peter Duchin

Students To Direct
Troubadour Plays

the Troubadour Theatre has two
more major productions scheduled for
the remainder of the academic year.
In March Wycherley’s “A Country
Wife” will be presented in three acts
under student direction. In May two
new one-act plays will be produced.

One of the one-act plays was writ-
ten by Scott Miller, a 1967 graduate
of W&L. The other play has not
been decided yet. Last May, Miller
wrote and directed the one-act, “In
Which The Parsinant Flies.”

In addition to the above produc-
tions, the Troubadours will partici-
pate in the state one-act play contest

at the University of Virginia on
February 17.
The Troubadours have presented

two theatrical productions this year.
the first one, Boris Vian's “The
Empire Builders,” was a three act play
in November. The play had been per-
formed only once before in the United
States.

Their second major production was
“The Caucasian Chalk Circle” by
Bertolt Brecht, The play, produced in

December, had one of the largest
casts ever to appear in a Troub
production

 

 

The internationally famous Peter
Duchin Orchestra will again perform
at the Fancy Dress Ball Friday eve-
ning in what promises to be enjoy-
able time for all. Peter Duchin has
played at several of President John-
son’s parties and also performed at
Lynda Johnson's wedding reception.

The Ball will begin at 9 p.m. with
‘The Figure’ which is a presentation
of the president and vice-presidents
of the Dance Board and their dates.
The theme of the dance will be “High
Society.”

Again the dress will be tuxedo or
fully formal dress of tails. This man-
ner of attire proved popular last year
so that the Dance Board decided to
continue it this year. In previous
years, Fancy Dress has been high-
lighted by the wearing of gay colonial
and royal costumes, but many students
complained of the high costs and the
shabby condition of the outfits.

The Ball will take place in Evans
Dining Hall which will be decorated
with a large garden and fountain in
the middle of the floor which will be
lighted with blue lights to provide
a true atmosphere of high society.

Mitch Ryder

The Mitch Ryder Revue will per-
form from 8 to 10 p.m. in Doremus

Gymnasium on Saturday. Mitch
Ryder is a “blue-eyed soul brother”
whose repertoire includes mostly

rhythm and blues, but he is capable
of playing psychedelic music.

The performance of the Mitch
Ryder Revue should please both soul
and psychedelic fans and help every-
one to celebrate the end of exams.

 

 

M. H. Leach Is
New Librarian:
Coleman Retires

The appointment of Maurice D.
Leach Jr. as head librarian, with the
rank of professor, at Washington and
Lee University was announced here
today by Acting President Dr. Wil-
liam W. Pusey HI.

Leach, 44, will succeed Henry E.
Coleman Jr., who is retiring after
serving as head librarian for the past
20 years. The new librarian will be-
gin his duties on July 1.

In announcing the apointment, Dr.
Pusey commented, “Mr. Leach has

South Carolina Senator

Will Speak On

Senator Strom Thurmond, the
senior senator from South Carolina
and a leader in the Republican party

in the South, will speak in Lee
Chapel on February 20. The Young
Republicans will sponsor the Lee

Chapel speech and the South Carolina
Delegation will host a dinner in honor
of the senator at Evans Dining Hall.

rhe filet mignon dinner is open to
the public and the cost will be
minimal according to delegation chair-
man Joe Wilson. The South Caro-
lina auxiliary delegations at Hollins,
Mary Baldwin, Sweet Briar and Ran-
dolph-Macon are planning to attend
the dinner and speech.

Presidential Race
In 1948 Thurmond ran for Presi-
dent as a States’ Rights Democrat
carrying four states and winning 39
electoral votes. He also was the first
person ever elected to a major office
in a write-in campaign, (U.S, Senate,
1954) he delivered the longest speech
in U.S. Senate history (24 hours and
18 minutes on June 17, 1957), and
in 1964 he took the fateful step of
switching to the Republican party in
a Democrat state, but in 1966 was
re-elected sweeping all counties ex-

cept one as a Republican.

Past Positions

He has served as a teacher, county
superintendent of education, city and
county attorney, and in all three

 

W&L Campus

branches of the state government—
as state senator, circuit judge, and
governor of South Carolina 1947-51.
Today the Senator is a major gen-
eral in the army reserve, and is the
ranking reserve officer in the United
States Congress. He has served as na-
tional president of the Reserve Officers
Association and the Military Govern-
ment Association.

The Senator won particular dis-
tinction in the Senate during 1961
and 1962 in his fight against what
he has described as the State De-
partment’s “no-win” foreign policy
in the cold war and the muzzling of
military officers in their anti-com-
munist statements, troop education
programs and cold war seminars for
reservists and the public, After ex-
posing the now-famous Fulbright
Memorandum, which urged curtail-
ment of information on communism
to the military and the public, the
Senator won an investigation by a
special Senate subcommittee on mili
tary speech censorship and cold war
education activities.

Committee Assignments
He serves on the Commerce and
Armed Services Committees, two of
the most important committees in the
Senate. On Commerce, he is chair-
man of the subcommittee which is
concerned with all surface transporta-

Contact Offers A Varied Fare
To Analyze Grand Old Party

Morton

Iruston B. Morton, the proverb-
ally unbeatable Republican Senator
from Kentucky, will open Contact
by speaking on the topic of rights and
duties of the opposition party. An in-
sight into the present administration’s
internal conflict over Viet Nam policy
is also expected.

Morton’s three Congessional and
two Senatorial victories mark a dis-
tinct break from his home state’s
traditional support of the Democratic

Party. While serv-

ing his first sena-
Behind

torial term in 1958,
after heavy G.O.P.
Contact losses that year,
Morton was asked by President Eisen-
hower to head the Republican Na-
tional Committee. His outstanding
performance in this position was re-
warded by his acquisition of the
Chairmanship of the Republican Na-
tional Campaign Committee. Morton
also served as Permanent Chairman
of the 1964 Republican National
Convention.

Morton’s recent denunciation of the
Johnson Administration's Vietnam
policy was not unexepcted in view
of his predictably liberal views on
foreign policy. It will be interesting
however, to discover how he recon-
ciles this position with the philosophy
of bi-partisanship that has been the
corner stone of the detente between
the Republican and Democratic Part-
ies in the sphere of international re-
lations,

A seventh generation Kentuckian,
Morton entered Congress for the first
time in 1946 after first serving over
four years in the Navy in the Pacific
theatre and a short term as president
of Ballard and Ballard Company in
Louisville.

Morton was elected U. S. Repre-
sentative from the Third Kentucky
District for two more terms before
being appointed in 1953 as Assistant
Secretary of State for Congressional
Relations by President Eisenhower.
He resigned this post in 1956 and
defeated incumbent Democratic Sen-
ate Whip Earl Clements by a small

majority for his first seat in the
upper house.

Morton is presently the second-
ranking Republican on the Senate;

also to the powerful Senate Finance
Committee, the District of Columbia
Committee, and the Special Commit-
tee on Aging.

Lubell

Samuel Lubell brings to “What’s
New, Pachyderm?” a perceptive mind
and keen sensibility sharpened by
many years of close contact with the
American voter, He is, as one ob-
server called him, “an interviewer
par excellence.” He says of his work,
“I try to make my stories representa-
tive of the talk going on in the
country among people themselves. As
people read my stories | want them to
know and say to themselves, “That's
how I feel,” or, “That sounds just
like that fool | was arguing with
the other day!”

Savoring Vagaries

Lubell is a man who savors the
vagaries of the political scene. In
“When People Speak” he quotes a
man he once talked to in Houston.
Asked who he supported for Presi-
dent, the man replied, “I ain't voted
since they shot Huey Long. He was
my man.”

Lubell, who will speak Saturday,
February 10, at Lee Chapel, was born
in Poland in 1911. He and his parents
migrated to America just a few
months before World War | engulfed

Eastern Europe.
More

He attended eve-
Ideas ning classes at the

College of the City

Behind of New York and
graduated from
Contact the School of

Journalism at Columbia in 1933. He
was a Pulitzer Travelling Scholar in
Europe in 1934. He soon got a job
with the Long Island Daily Press and
then found his way to the Wash-
ington area where he worked for the
Washington Post, moved south for a
while to write for the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, and then returned to
D.C. and a position with the Wash-
ington Herald.

Experience in the governmental
field came with jobs with the Office
of Facts and Figures and the Office
of War Information, Later he worked
with Bernard M. Baruch on the
Baruch Committee and was executive

assistant to him on his war time
reports, among them the Survey on
Post-War Reconstruction and Eco-
nomic Policies.

War Correspondent

Lubell was a war correspondent in
the China-Burma-India-Theatre in the
closing days of World War IL.
Later he saw first hand the destruction
of Europe as a correpnodent for the
Providence Journal and North Ameri-
can Newspaper Alliance.

Lubell has been involved with
political writing ever since Roose
velt’s third term. He has done depth
of the elections of 1948,
1950, 1952, 1954, 1956, and 1958

The Making of Presidential Candi-
dates.” He is also the author of

In a recent New York Times Book
Review Section, Patrick Anderson
praised the thoroughness with which
Hess and Broder examined the Re-
publican Party. “Now and then, par-
ticularly in their 50-state survey of
the party's standing, the authors tell
the average reader more than he
may want to know about the Re-
publican grass roots, but that is a
risk they had to run in order to
satisfy the professional politicians
who will read this book as a veritable

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Not an ‘either-or’ matter

We don’t like to give more publicity than we must to Mr.
Dunbar’s Friday Protest against conventional dress and against
teachers who want to see it observed (inasmuch as that protest
differs from his Thursday Protest against Richard Nixon, and
from the protest we half expect him to launch tomorrow
against the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi). But on the other
hand we can’t see ourself
allowing to pass unchalleng-
ed what we feel is a series of
gross public misrepresenta-
tions of this University’s
character.

We agree that students
ought to enter this Univer-
sity prepared—for conven-
tional dress, for the Honor
System, and for everything
else they accepted by impli-
cation when they accepted

 

 

an offer to matriculate at
Washington and Lee. We
thought the point had been
driven into the ground, but apparently it requires further
reiteration: one among the myriad things that set this Uni-

ROBERT IL. DUNBAR

versity above so many others is the ability of students (most
students, anyway) to come to classes prepared AND dressed
respectably, respectfully. Mr. Dunbar asks in his letter, “Which
should be emphasized the lust for knowledge or a tie and
jacket?” To most of us, it is not an “‘either-or’’ situation.

We are glad that Mr. Dunbar, in arguing this matter, is
once again in a minority. So many students have signed for
Professor Colvin’s courses next semester(and none of them
are “gut” courses) that two of them had to be closed, an|
unprecedented action. The implication is that these many |
students accept, among other things, the terms of sartorial |

 

appearance in class as outlined in Dr. Colvin’s letter to this |
newspaper. Closing courses is itself far from good, but it does |
serve in this instance as an indication that many, many people
do not fear the prospect of being encouraged to wear a coat

and tie and shoes and socks to class, and going to class pre- ‘

pa red as well,

 

A valid need for valid data

Everybody's avocation in recent years has been knocking
McCormick Library: “books are too old,” “books are poorly
selected,” “books are far too few in number.” The Ring-tum
Phi, even under current proprietorship, has engaged upon
occasion in library-attacking. Most fashionable of late has been
the Statistical Comparison With Other Colleges, with vary-
ing sub-themes—the Budgetary Analysis, the Sex-Cage En-
quiry, the Median-Age-of-Books Tabulation, and so forth.
Conclusions have been uniformly damning. While we hasten
to say that we aren’t claiming everything is fine and dandy, we
would like to suggest the outlines of possible future investiga-
tion which might show that ours is not the Black Hole Of ALL
College Libraries.

First, somebody preferably a critic who has made Statisti-
c al investigations ot this sort before —could survey other col-
leges to see not how many books they own but rather how
many are available for use. We were surprised at Christmas-
time when we spent several days in Yale’s Sterling Memorial
Library, which owns 4,826,148 volues and spent $3,029,624
last year. Because books are circulated for three months at a
time at Yale, and probably for others, less obvious reasons as
well, though books are almost unbelievably unavailable there.
his is a chronic condition, say dissatisfied Yalies—and by
empirical testing, we found that more books on randomly
selected topics were available in every instance in McCormick
than at Yale. If a library is to be used—that is, if books are
to be available to undergaduates rather than just owned
then perhaps we aren't quite so poorly off here as some.

lo the people who compile figures on the number of
acquisitions elsewhere: tor the sake of validity, why not try
avoiding universities with graduate schools, or at least books
acquired specifically for graduate-school libraries within other
universities ¢ And please avoid counting duplic ate copies
needed and bought by huge universities when we buy only one
to satisfy the same need. Acquiring a volume written in Ra-
jasthani (and there are books in that language) might hill a
need at Yale, but probably wouldn't here. Yale might need
ind buy fen copies ot that book and thereby increase it Ac quis

$50,000 War A gainst Poverty
Waged By Reverend Brown

By LARRY HONIG
|

In his muted brown sportcoat and |
clerical collar, Tom Brown sips coffee |
and talks leisurely in the Co-op with
students. Five minutes later, he walks
the icy cement to be with the children
of Rockbridge County’s poorest fam-
ilies.

For Rev, J. Thompson Brown,
Assistant Rector of the R. E. Lee
Memorial Church, working in con-
trasts is a way of life. Those people
in his congregation and those he meets
as Episcopal Chaplain to Washington
and Lee are only a part of his con-
cern,

—

Brown also directs the Rockbridge
Area Community Action Council,
whose annual budget of $50,000
finances a hefty poverty program in
the Lexington area.

Facing the Problems
The Council was formed 15 months
ago by interested county residents to
study local problems—educational
level of citizens, employment, hous-
ing, job discrimination—and then to

try to do something about it.
Because of the reduction in federal
expenditures on poverty programs,
the local group had to give up plans
of independent government financing
and joined the Roanoke-based TAP
program (Total Action against Pov-
erty), from which most of the funds

the same guideline), but is for those

are received,
In the Neighborhoods
With professional aid from TAP,

the Council began work on Brown's |
assumption that the poor ($3,000 an- |
nual income for a family of four)
“had the innate human to

resources

 

| better

their way of life.”

The immediate result, in March of
last year, was a program of neigh-
borhood development whose goal was
to allay the depressed attitude of the
poor. Five neighborhood workers,
classified as poor themselves, were
hired for $3,600 to meet once a week
with their peers for training and dis-
cussion of common problems.

Before School

A result of the rapid growth of
the poverty program was the recent
formulation of a Day Care Center
and a Child Care Center. The Day
Care Center is a kindergarten for poor
children, the regulations for which
are set by the Office of Economic
Opportunity (which finances TAP).

For instance, for each fifteen chil-
dren in the Day Care program, there
must be a teacher who holds a col-
lege degree, an aide, a cook and aide,
a janitor, and a bus driver. Under
the OEO rules, the local governing
agency of the program must con-
tribute 10% toward Day Care.

In-Kind Contributions

This 10% is given primarily by the
vestry of the R. E. Lee Church, who
have waived rent on their educational
building. Lexington attorney William
O. Roberts and Dr. Robert Munger
contribute their services,

Famed ‘Mink’ Magazine Replaced

W&L ‘Collegian’

By REEVE KELSEY

One of the long lost publications
of the W&L publishing tradition is
the “Mink Magazine” which first
emerged on the Colonnade in the fall
of 1920 and flourished until 1929, a
year that was the end of many
glorious things. “Mink” was an unbe-
lievable collection of jokes and puns
of printable and, more often than
not, unprintable nature, along with

occasional story or essay.

“*Mink’ has just been informed
that the reason there are no asylums

examples of the sick-“Mink” humor,
A conversation between Black and
White is the epidome of “Mink”
punny humor: “Black: ‘I saw a girl
drinking rum this afternoon.’ White:
‘Jamaica?’ Black: ‘No, she already
had a date’.”
“Wash-Lee Wash”

There was an exchange column of
sorts, entitled the “Wash-Lee Wash,”
which ran all of the most miserable
jokes that could be culled from so-
called comic magazines across the
nation, This poet’s reply to his edi-
tor again shows the level of humor
reached by “Mink”; “Editor: ‘Say,
this isn’t poetry; it’s merely an escape
of gas.’ Poet: ‘Do you mean that the
meter is wrong’.”! ? [Laugh.]

Each amazing issue contained, by
conservative estimate, 100 or more
of these gems of humor under columns

Snow Thwarts Tankmen

Che great snow of January 13 which
cancelled the basketball game against
East Carolina also thwarted Coach
Stearns’ tankmen in their trip to
Durham, North Carolian and a meet
aginst Duke.

The Generals got as far as Natural
Bridge in their trip before acknowl-
edging the power of the elements.
Instead the tankmen had performance
tests that afternoon, and according to
Coach Stearns their performances are
continuing to improve.

After the exams the swimmers face
a heavy schedule until the end of the
season. On February 9 they travel
to Old Dominion for a meet which

will be followed by home meets
against Loyola and West Virginia Uni-
versity on the 16th and 20th of
February respectively. They then

travel to St. Louis with the wrestling
team to compete in the CAC finals.
The Generals so far this year have
a 2-2 record. Their two losses have
been to powerful teams: American
University and Catholic University

 

both in Washington. The over-all
standouts have been veteran junior
Billy Ball and the freshman marvel,
Bill Brumback. In the Catholic meet
Brumback was able to beat Catholic
veteran Jim Reynolds in the 60 yard
and 100 yard freestyle events; against
American, Brumback captured a first
in the 100 yard freestyle and a second
in the long 1000 yard freestyle.

Ball, with a more balanced ability
captured a second in the 200  indi-
vidual medley and a first in the 200
yard backstroke against American.
In the Catholic meet Ball captured a
first in the 200 IM. and a second in
the backstroke event,

Co-captain Pat Costello and Noel
Clinard can be counted on to boost
the score. Costello relegated to third
place in the American meet, returned
with vengance to win in the Catholic
meet. Mike Berry, Costello’s under-
study, has won against Gettysburg
and Randolph-Macon, while Coach
Stearns did not swim Costello so as

Repeat Win Ove

By MARK BROMLEY

Last Friday night, Washington and
Lee's wrestling team was overpow-
ered by William and Mary. The loss,
by the score of 29-5, brought the
General's record to two wins while
suffering three defeats.

The team salvaged only a tie and
a win to account for its five points.

of repeating last year’s victory over
this same team.

Tuesday, p.m.

By RIC BERARD

In an effort to clarify the re-
scheduling of the East Carolina game
which was snowed out last Saturday
night, I talked with Rob Bauer yester-
day an dhe said: “We had East Caro-
lina scheduled for this Wednesday at
Greenville but there is a University
regulation that says that there can
be no away athletic contests for five
days prior to an exam period. Since
Wednesday would have been the fifth
day and he said: “We had East Caro-
while we are discussing February 21
as a possible make-up date, it ap-
pears as though the game will be
scratched,”

a a *

Also last night,
Fauber as he limped away from
infirmary having been cured of
flu. Not looking especially well, Stu
confirmed the fact that despite the
excellent medical care and personal
attention of good ole Nurse Hotinger,
he would not be able to play until
Friday against Mars Hill. It’s too bad
because Stu is a fine athlete with a
lot of desire and his talents have
been missed. We all hope he is in
good shape by Friday, (Hear that,
Nurse Hotinger?!)

Actually, Fauber isn’t the _ first
member of his family to come to WK&L
and play basketball. His brother,
Roger, was here in the early sixties
as one of W&L’s starting “forwards,”
a term replaced by Coach Canfield
with them ore current jargon of
“wing.”

With respect to the remainder of
the schedule, Stu said that the tough-
est part of our schedule would be
in February when we tackle both
Roanoke and Old Dominion College
(which beat East Carolina by one
point in Greenville.) And while our
game with O.D.C. will be particularly
rough since it is their “homecoming
game”—they don't have a football
program and basketball is their major
sport with all the trappings and school
pride that we have traditionally as-
sociated with football, our team this

year is even more unified than last
year. Declaring that “we found our-
selves against Lycoming (W&L’s only
loss thus far),” Stu gave advance
warning to what type of ball the
team intends to play towards win-
ning the state smal college basketball
title.

Let’s hope we keep the ball bounc-
ing our way in the two home games
this week. The first game is against
Greensboro College at 8:00 p.m. to-
night. The second, which should be
a close game, is with a good Mar

Hill College five-some on Friday
night, also at 8:00 p.m.
For those of you who are des-

perate for a real school cheer to let
forth with at tonight’s game, I sug-
gest the following from which the
name of this sacred publication was
derived in 1897:

Canfield To Re-schedule

East Carolina Game

Saturday morning found the Gen-
erals unable to leave for their game
with East Carolina. At the present
time, due to exams, a date has not
been found for rescheduling the game.
East Carolina was one of the high-
lights of this year’s schedule and
Coach Canfield is trying to find
another date that is mutually con-
vienent to both teams.

fonight the Generals take on
Greensboro College and Friday night
they meet Mars Hill. Both games
are at home. After exams the Gen-
erals will take on Roanoke College
and Old Dominion in what promises
to be two of the harder games of
the season.

neighborhood youth core program
provides summer employment, at the
minimum wage, for potential high-
school dropouts.

In return, the Council asks for a
moral commitment to remain in
school one more year. Of the 50
participants this summer, 60% Negro,
none has dropped out.

In addition, there is an in-school
neighborhood youth core program,
whose participants (all classified as
being from poor families) are given
jobs for 12 hours a week. The Labor
Department pays for these two pro-
grams.

The Department of the Interior
funds a program for 15 men aged
around 45, called Operation Main-
stream. These people are given jobs

The Rockbridge County Board of

program — and will likely become
more pleased if, as Brown predicts,
the welfare rolls begin to drop names.

But for Brown, the father of a
girl, 7, and a boy, 2, the poverty
program must not be overrated. “From

remarkable.

Clinard has captured two firsts in
three outings as W&L's leading diver.
His only defeat came at the hands
on Catholic University which defi-
nitely had a home pool advantage.

The opening relay team of Billy
Ball (backstroke), Pat Costello (breast-
stroke), Dave Kympton (dolphin-but-
terfly), and Ross Forman (freestyle)
provide a formidable challenge for
any opposing team, and have in-
scribed their names on the Randolph-
Macon record-board with a fast 3:58,7
seconds in the 20 yard pool.

Other General dependable include
Chuck Garten and Scott McElroy in
the long-distance freestyle events.
Garten has become an expert at the

1000 yard freestyle which is 43 long }}

lengths of the Doremus pool. Dave
Kympiton has turned in excelelnt per-

the freestyle sprints. Dave Frankstone
and freshman, Hal Catlin can be de-

composition,

Nixon's reception was

(Continued from page 2)
“Mink-Convulsions,” “Mink-Hang-
overs,” and “Mink-Sickness.”

There was also fare of poetical and
prose works. The poetry dealt with
the high platonic and spiritual love.
A typical poem is given in its un-
abridged and unexpurgated form:

“Love is like an onion
We taste it with delight
But when it is gone,
we wonder

Whatever made us bite.”

In attempting to find the person
responsible for this oasis of sickness,
we found a staff box called the “Mink
Family” with its listing of “The
Mink” (editor), “Funny-Mink” (joke
editor), the “Kitty-Minks” (the copy
editors), and the “Business-Minklets”
(the business staff).

What was even more surprising to
discover was that the first editor of
“Mink” was Fitzgerald Flournoy, a
long-loved and venerated professor of
English at Washington and Lee. Dr.
Flournoy also wrote a little poetry,
none of which was reminiscent of his
more unrestrained days as editor of
“Mink.” A current member of the
faculty has characteried Dr. Flour-
noy as a true Elizabethan—one might
assume that is where he acquired his
pleasure for puns.

The first editorial explained the
derivation of “Mink’s” name: “ ‘Mink’
is a title that has long been applied
to the men of Washington and Lee.
If, as rumor has it, the name was
originated by our friends at the Insti-
tution across the way, we can readily
understand why it should be so, for
it is well and widely known that the
mink always gets ahead of the rats. .”
The magazine was full of special
features, like its “Frat A B C’s”: “Pi
Delta Theta: Good at drinking tea!
Rather high hat — smart-looking
women always accompany them.”
“Swigma Chi: Smart looking boys—
Never bring their own women but do
a lot of cutting.” “Kappa Falfa: The
life of the party, their absence is
ruinous to the welfare of young
women who want something different
in the way of—entertainment.” And
“Theta Bilto Pi: More conservative—
rather conceited about themselves, but
nice boys on the whole.”

There was also a great fad of “U
tell °em jokes” which were the most
horrid example of the American cul-
ture of the ’20’s: “U tell ‘em wheel,
I just spoke;” “U tell ‘em water,
you've been drunk;” and “U tell ’em
Sigma, these jokes are Nu.”

In order to frustrate exam study-
ing, the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi will
conduct a contest with prizes by
the bushel (first place: a free cup
of coffee) for the person who sub-
mits the best “U tell ’em joke”
on the contemporary “W&L” scene.
All entries must be submitted to
any member of the Tuesday staff
before Fancy Dress. The decison
of the judges will be FINAL!

 

‘Mink’ Magazine of the Twenties

The Southern Collegian had sus-
pended publication during World War
1 and had not resumed publication at
the time of “Mink’s” birth. The Col-
legian appeared again in 1927 of a
much nobler stuff than today. The
competition with the Collegian and
the weight of the Great Depression
must have conspired to kill “Mink.”
But then, did any magazine which
printed the following poem deserve to
live?:

“Three Blind Dates

They want to make you run

Three Blind Dates sad everyone—

All three a perfect fright

Never saw such in your life

As these three blind Dates.”
