48 Students Named Recipients
Of R. E. Lee Research Grants

The recipients of this year’s Robert E. Lee Research grants have been
announced by Dean William W. Pusey. A total of 50 students, 16 less than
last year, have been named to work on 39 different projects under faculty
supervision, The number of projects announced thus far represents a drop
of seven from last year’s total.

The research fund was established in the fall of 1960, through a gift
of more than a quarter of a million dollars by the late Dr. Gustavus Benz
Capito, an alumnus of the class of 1899, The projects are either for the
purpose of assisting a professor in his research, or of varrying out a plan of
research under a professor’s supervision,

Since its inception, 413 students have participated in a total of 318
projects.

Each year, the Student War Memor-
ial Scholarship Fund Committee,
known as SWMSFC (pronounced
“swamps”) raises $1500 through var-
ious activities to give to the Univer-
sity in the form of a scholarship. This
scholarship is awarded to sons of
deceased veterans.

The organization raises funds by
selling cokes at the concerts during
big dance weekends and selling class
rings at the Coop. In addition, the
organization is in charge of the con-
cesisons for graduation invitations and
caps and gowns. The Committee re-
ceives a commission from each cap
and gown rented, as well as from
each graduation invitation.

Further revenues are accumulated
by means of checking coats at the
Fancy Dress Ball. An annual fall raf-
fle, with the drawing being held at
the halftime of the Homecoming foot-
ball game, raises more money. The
prizes for the raffle are donated by
the local clothing stores—College
Town Shop, Thomas Limited and
Alvin-Dennis.

Primary Eliminates Freshman Candidates;
First-Year, Law School Elections Monday

By DOWNS LITTLE

Thursday night, the seven run-off
candidates for the freshman offices
of Executive Committee, president,
and vice-president presented _ their
campaign speeches in Evans Dining
Hall.

rhese primary speeches offered the
candidates their first opportunities to
address the freshmen formally on the
issues of concern. Following the in-
troductory remarks by EC members,
Lee Halford and Herb Crenshaw,
various sponsors nominated their re-
spective candidates for office.

A tie vote for EC in Wednesday's
primary balloting between Henry
Harkley and Sky Lininger was run-
off after the speeches. Lininger was
the winner, amassing 88 votes to
Markey’s 67. Thus Lininger will
oppose Joe Tompkins for the fresh-
man EC post Monday.

Joe Tompkins asked that the pres-
ent Honor System be continued and
asked for more and better facilities
for independent students. He sug-
gested that the Gaines Society be
backed financially by the EC.

Lininger defined the EC powers
as administering the Honor Code and
as having diverse appointive powers.
Aside from favoring the keeping of
the Honer Code intact, he supported
having a maximum of two exams in

#!wo days instead of the present maxi-
mum of three in the same period.

The Curriculum Committee

After several months of discussion and research, the stu-
dent Curriculum Committee finally took shape this week with
the appointment of seven students to the committee, including
former EC representative Lane Steinger as chairman.

Their job is probably the most unenviable one in the history
of EC subcommittees. There are no guidelines, no precedents
for them to follow. Investigations into the procedures and goals
of similar committees at other colleges have only emphasized
the rather obvious point that successful institutions else-
where cannot the transplanted whole to W&L. Steinger, who
originally proposed the creation of the committee, predicts
that its first year will probably be no more than a period of
“exploration” and “trial and error.”

The overall aim is one of “curriculum review”—an exami-
nation of the present curriculum from a student point of view,
leading presumably to suggestions for improvement in the
form of recommendations to the EC. A major part of the effort
will be polling student opinion on all courses and major, prob-
ably by such means as dividing the students up according to
their grades, issuing a general questionnaire, and taking random
surveys to obtain a cross-section of opinion. Hopefully, the
committee can also study means of encouraging intellectual
endeavor among students. The exact procedures and goals
will be outlined within the next few weeks by the EC.

The Curriculum Committee is going to suffer all the dis-
appointments and failures which inevitably cling to a tradition-
less committee with a very difficult and unpopular job. Several
faculty members have already voiced their contempt and dis-
like for the whole idea. To suggest that students are in any
position to judge the merits and faults of any course may
seem understandably ridiculous to an educator of many years’
experience. There is a very real danger that any proposal which
reaches the faculty from the student Curriculum Committee
will automatically receive an impatient and uninspired rejection.

Pushing from the other side will be a great many students
anxious to “get things done,” eager to win reform, and all
too ready to mistake careful deliberation by the committee for
inaction or weakness. The committee members may occasion-
ally have to watch out for the same symptoms in themselves;
it is a common failing among student leaders that they feel
uncomfortable unless they are constantly engaged in full com-
bat with something or other. (However, to judge from the
persons who were selected for the committee, we can safely
hope this will not be a problem.)

There was never a job which called for so much tact and
mutual patience. But the benefits which both students and
faculty may obtain from the committee’s gradual and un-
spectacular labor make it well worth the effort for both sides.

Sixteenth-Century Books Shown

by Martin Luther—they don’t add up| tributed the books to help replace

Look again. The “Life and Fables
of Aesop” which went on display this
week in McCormick Library is over
S00 years old. The botany book,
“Histoire des Plantes,” was published
in 1549 with the text in Greek, Latin,
and French. The theological tract
(Dye Andere Epistel S. Petri und Aine
S. Judas) was printed while Luther
was a hearty 41 years old, in 1524.

These and other works are part of
the university's rare book collection,
generally stored in the top stack level
of the library. “Some people say
they're not rare at all,” says Mr. Henry
Coleman, head librarian, “They're just |

 

old,” dating back in some cases to
the 1400's.

The “Life and Fables of Aesop”
is the work of Robert Etienne (Stepha-

Job

 

By NEIL KESSLER

Approximately 285 undergraduates
are receiving a total of $315,000 from
Washington and Lee University in the
form of loans and scholarship grants.

This represents the highest number
of students on aid in the history of
the school. This is also the largest
amount of money awarded by the
University for this purpose.

Participation in federal programs
and larger endowments have been re-
sponsible for the rise in the amount
of loans and grants,

The freshman class leads all others
in the number of students receiving |
aid. About 81 are in this category.
The sophomore class has 72 on aid,
while the junior class and the senior
class have 76 and 56 respectively.

Because new federal programs are
being instituted each year and the
attrition rate increases as the student
furthers his education, the freshman
class has the most students on aid.

Around $4,000 of the $315,000 is
straight loan from WAL. The rest is)
provided through various government |
programs. The government allows the!
University to give & maximum of
$63,750 in federal loans. Thus far,
$63,500 have been awarded

The federal government also pro
vides $28,000 to be given as straight
grants to all specified lower income
groups. There is an $800 maximum
of government grants which the school

the financial aid program is being
met. “On the basis of the Parents’
Confidential Statement,” Noell said,
“all students showing a computed need
for aid will receive the full amount
necessary to finance their education.”

As the cost of higher education
rises each year, (tuition will go up
from $1,600 this year to $2,000 by
1970) more and more individuals will
find the need to acquire grants and
loans. WAL is keeping pace with
this need.

up-to-date on the
current status of
the university.”

The three-day
session centered
around talks given
by various faculty
members and “dia-
logues” between the faculty and the
alumni. A major feature was a lunch-

eon attended solely by alumni dele-
gates and a “wide variety of student
representatives ...to provide an un-
inhibited exchange of views between
alumni and students.”

Unfortunately most of the speeches
on academic excellence and the prob-
lems of maintaining a good faculty
seemed to go over the heads of most
of our alumni. The major topics which
the alumni were interested in ranged
all the way from fraternities to con-
ventional dress to fraternities,

As Dean Atwood judiciously ex-
presed it, “They were not nearly as
concerned over academic progress
and the faculty as conventional dress
and fraternities.”

One of the students who partici-
pated in the luncheon put it dif-
ferently: “Their attitude was pretty
poor. They felt freshmen ought to be
indoctrinated to conventional dress.”

According to another student,
“There was some very vocal opposi-
tion to changes in the fraternity sys-
tem, The only question about the
faculiy was with regard to the sub-
ject of fraternities.”

“Most of the questions were about
student life because that is what they
are concerned with.” Atwood said
“They are concerned with the "WAl
man whatever that is. They want to
reassured that there still is
‘WAL man”

The alumni did make one criticism
of fraternities which would seem
worth noting. Many were upset, it was
reported, “because underclassmen lead
fraternities,”

 

 

in contrast to “the good!

W&L. Having known some of the stu-
dents before coming to W&L, he
found it very easy to adjust and con-
sidered his job to be very interesting
and challenging.

Mr. Vurnex, who has an eight year
old daughter, Denise, is an avid fan
of football and an eager supporter
of W&L’s team. He predicted the first
two victories of the team and antici-
pates future winnings by both the
gridiron and basketball teams. Con-
cerning athletics, he feels that the
student support at W&L is badly lack-
ing and that the students should more
actively participate in the athletic
program.

 

Alumni Meeting Profitable

old days” when juniors and seniors
were in command, This “evolution”
of the fraternity system whether for
better or for worse, is well worth
thinking about.

Thus far from the assortment of
comments offered one would gather
that W&I alumni, or at least the
ones who gathered here this past
weekend, are anywhere from  con-
servative to hopelessly outdated, de-
pending upon your point of view.

This is hardly a revelation.

What is revealing and what is im-
portant is that these 60 alumni repre-
senting 35 alumni chapters did take
the trouble to spend three days here.

As Dean Atwood said, “Everyone
is interested in W&L—that's why they
were here.”

The educational purposes of the
conference hopefully succeeded. These
60 alumni representatives have at
least been exposed to the Washington
and Lee of today. At least partially
the images of 20, of 30, of 40 years
ago have been altered.

It is to be hoped that conferences
of this kind, held for the first time
this year, will become a traditional
yearly affair. Our alumni, as well as
others, need to be shown that W&L,
like everything else, changes.

When somebody shines a light on a
hornets’ nest, they are liable to come
out stinging. Just ask Washington and |
Lee’s soccer Generals, who met a
swarm of Lynchburg Hornets under |
the lights of Lynchburg Municipal |
Stadium Wednesday night and suf- |
fered their second defeat of the sea- |
son, 3-2, The loss left the Blue booters |

with a 1-2 record going into tomor

Lynchburg

Opponents,” commented Coach Joe
Lyles after the game. “They outpassed
and outhustled us, but the score
could have easily been 4-3 our favor
instead of 3-2 theirs. Allen Craig's
goal in the first period was nullified
by an offsides call, and Scott Fechnay
should have been awarded a penalty
kick when he was knocked down
while going for a goal in the fourth
period,”

Ihe Generals opened the scoring
when Fechnay rifled in a penalty kick
1:26 into the game, but Lynchburg

|came back to tie things up in the

second stanza on Garunstiaga’s long-
range blast. No other scoring took
place in the first half, but Lynchburg
constantly threatened the Blue net.
by goalie Tom Mitchell
kept the Hornets off the scoreboard.

Constantly pressing the attack,
Lynchburg pulled away in the second
half on goals by Graves and Garunsti-
aga, his second of the night. W&l
finally made another dent in the scor-
ing column when co-captain Allen
Craig took a pass from lineman Jack
Horowitz and pushed across the Gen
erals’ second and final score.

“We had trouble in the middle of
the field all through the game,” Coach
Lyles declared. “We were playing
mostly sophomores and freshmen
there, and the lack of experience hurt.
Our passing was not sharp and, con-
sequently, our linemen never did get
any really good cracks at the goal.”

Lafayette, No. 3?

Generals Go North
For Leopard Hunt

By STUART PORTER

With two straight victories under
their belts, the W&L Generals take
a step up in competition this weekend
and travel to Easton, Pa. to tangle
with the Leopards of Lafayette. This |
game will mark the first meeting of |
these two teams. The contest will be |
broadcast over station WLUR-FM be-
ginning at 1 p.m. Kickoff is at 2 p.m.

According to Coach Lee Me-
Laughlin, this should prove to be
“our toughest game of the season,”
but the Generals have already upset
two previously favored teams. Ran-
dolph-Macon and Centre, so there
could be some surprises in store for
Lafayette fans,

Lafayete, which always has a rough
schedule, is 1-2 on the season, losing
its first two games to Harvard and

Hofstra, but then bouncing back last
Saturday to down a powerful Bucknell
squad, 21-6. The Leopards are finally
beginning to click as a team and there
is no doubt that the Generals will have
their hands full.

Leopard signal-caller Jerry Facciani
completed six of eleven passes for 69
yards last weekend, two of which were
to his favorite receiver, split end Dave
Robertshaw. On the ground, halfback
Robert Zimmer carried the ball 45
times gaining 160 yards.

General Casaulty List

Still hampered by injuries for W&L
are sophomore Johnny Nolan, de-
fensive secondary, and junior Hank
Wilson, defensive end. Nolan has a
bruised rib and Wilson, an injured
knee. Both boys were hurt in the
Macon game. Junior Fran Lawrence,

place the bottle-bearing machines
with cup-bearing machines by Mr.
Sumner, manager of the University
Supply Store. Mr. Sumner was
asked to look into the problem by
University Treasurer James White-
head, who told the R-t P, “dis-
posal of the bottles was the problem.
There was certainly no intention
to cheat anyone out of (four ounces
of) Coke.” Mr. Whitehead looked
into the possibility of a can-bearing
machine, but was informed that
cans would have to cost 15 cents,
and thus assumed the price to be
prohibitive. Mr. Whitehead further
stated that he knew nothing about
the problem, but made assurances
that “there is no reason why some-
thing can’t be worked out.” Evi-
dently, Messrs. Brooks, Twardy,
Morill, and the scores of freshmen
who signed the petition which is
posted on the Coke machine (see
picture, page 1) made no attempt to
investigate the problem, If any of
the letterwriters, or any other repre-
sentative of the freshman class
would see Mr. Whitehead in his
office in Washington Hall, we are
sure that the problem can be reeti-

Bucknell. However, he believes that
with an outstanding effort we have a
chance against Lafayette.

We will be taking 54 players to
Easton. This seems like a large num-
ber, but as the late Jim Tatum said,
“You need a first and second team on
offense, a first and second team on,
defense. That's 44 and then you need
some substitutes.”

As you may know the game will
be carried live on W&L FM Radio.
Here’s to “Good listening!”

Scientfic

(Continued from page 3)
The practice of trading game films
has made every team familiar with
cach week’s opponent. No longer can
a crafty coach pull a sleeper or a
lonely end play and catch his op-
ponent napping. Chances are that he
has tried it before and the game films
reveal it. Also the reports of a modern
scout border in length on the eigh-
teenth century novel. Complete in de-
tail to the most insignificant points,
the scouting report tells what a team
did the previous week. When the col-
lege player takes the field on Satur-
day, no doubt he knows his personal
opponent by heart-name, _ height,
weight, hometown and pinmate.

Such careful preparation leads to
much more than familiarity, how-
ever. By careful indoctrination
coaches convince their teams that they
are “ready” mentally and physically,
an important play for getting a team
in that mythical state of mind, “up.”
The plea to “win one for the Gripper”
comes on the practice field rather
than just before the game today.

The Recruiting Game
Also, the intersectional aspects of
expanded college football recruiting

Football

program must be considered. Farm
boys in Texas and street fighters in
Detroit no longer trudge to good old
State U. with cleats in hand. The
cream of the crop sit back and wait
for the good offer. A case in point is
the Notre Dame roster (come on,
how many of those Poles, Italians,
and Irish do you think come from
Indiana) which reflects coach Ara
Parsegian’s skillful coast-to-coast re-
cruiting. This concept has juggled the
talent more than in the past, and
if it doesn’t cause teams to be equal
in ability, it at least allows some of
the smaller teams to come up with a
super-star who can lead them to
victories, and upsets.

For these reasons, the season's
traditional “Black Saturday,” when a
few top teams fall from the unbeaten
ranks, has become rather meaning-
less, for each Saturday is black for
someone, as often as not one of the
nation’s best. In closing, just a little
advice. Forget last year’s 51-0 score
in the Notre Dame-U.S.C. battle. You
can bet Coach John McKay has
studied game films till he thinks he is

|a movie critic. If someone gives you

Southern Cal and a couple of points,
grab your wallet quick.

(Continued from page 3)
a defensive halfback, has just rejoined
the team after a two week illness,
but will probaly not see action this
weekend.

If senior halfback Bill McDavid
plays against the Leopards as he did
against Centre and junior linebacker
John Wolf plays as well as he has
been playing all the season, the Big
Blue could provide some exiting radio
entertainment. Freshmen Lee Graham
and Drew Kumpuris who both started
in the Centre game at defensive left
halfback and linebacker, respectively,
may also give the Leopards something
to think about.

CAC Roundup

The season outlook seems bright for
the W&L eleven as far as the CAC
race is concerned. Centre, a pre- sea-
son choice to win top honors, has a
1-1 conference slate, its win a 20-19
cliff-hanger over Southwestern. Wash-
ington U., 1-0, also downed the Lynx
in a squeaker, won with a field goal
in the last eight seconds. Thus, if the
Generals can keep pulling together
as a team and make some minor im-
provements, they could just cop con-
ference honors this year. After all,
they've already shown that two up-
sets in a row are possible. Would you
believe three?

(Continued from page 1)

A common theme throughout the
candidates’ addresses was class unity.
This was first stressed by vice-presi-
dential hopeful, Rick Osborne. Os-
borne emphasized that the power of
the vice-president was not useless and
should be used to fullfill the duties
of the office.

Ronnie Hunt, the second candidate
for vice-president, said that each fresh-
man could “make or break the class”
and that the actions of the class would
be reflected in those of the individual
student. “This,” said Hunt, “is what
makes class unity so important.”

Both presidential candidates, Jim
Carpenter and Jack Cartwright, again
echoed the needs of class unity.
Among the changes for W&L cited
by Carpenter were the formation of
a Freshman Avisory Council “to hear
complaints by and against members
of the class,” the reinstitution of the
WAL Club to help stimulate spectator
participation in sports, and the fur-
nishing of the freshman dormitory
reading rooms “so they might be ac-
ceptable in receiving dates.”

Cartwright emphasized the neces-
sity of maintaining the Honor System
intact, as well as the traditions of
gentlemanly dress and behavior. He
also stated that the president should
serve as the link between the fresh-
man class and the administration.

Final selections of president, vice-
president and EC will be Monday
for the freshmen in the undergradu-
ate and law schools. Polls will be
open in the Freshman Quad from 8
am. until 2 p.m. Nominations for
freshman Law School officers will be
made from the floor Monday night
at 7 p.m. in Tucker Hall and will
be followed by speeches and ballot-
ling.

 

Soccer Team Loses

(Continued from page 3)

The only truly satisfying W&L per-
formance was turned in by goalie
fom Mitchell, who, according to his
coach, “played the finest game in
goal of any collegiate soccer player
| have ever seen.” Mitchell made
twenty-three saves, including fifteen
of above-average difficulty, as com-
pared to only six saves by the Lynch-
burg goalie. “In Mitchell, WAL has
a definite candidate for All-America,”
Lyles declared.

The Generals meet Wililam and
Mary tomorrow at 3:00 p.m, in Lex-
ington. Coach Lyles, while not openly
predicting a victory, seemed confi-
dent. “We are in right now what
you might call the ‘twilight’,” he said.

(Continued from page 2)

I will base my stand on these issues:

1) The honor system should be
supported as it stands. Any change
in the finality of honor trial decisions
would result in a weakening of the
honor system.

2) Every effort should be made to
improve conditions for independent,
non-fraternity students. The indepen-
dents make up 20% of the student
body and their interests should not
be neglected. Arrangements should be
made so that independents have the
opportunity to enjoy the fullest pos-
sible campus life.

3) School spirit and student partici-
pation should be stressed. The sup-
port for athletic events should be
augmented by the formation of a
pep band and other spirit organiza-
tions who would regularly attend
W&L athletic events.

4) The Executive Committee should
push the construction of badly needed
facilities along with the improvement
of present buildings. Particular em-
phasis should be placed on a new
field house, adequate parking facilities,
and better equipped dormitories.

5) Compulsory Sophomore dorms
should be opposed b ythe Executive
Committee. Sophomores should have
the right to choose where they want
to live.

6) The possibility of allowing fresh-
men to have cars must seriously be
considered. The installation of the
delayed rush system will make this
necessary in order for freshmen to
have access to the campus and sur-
rounding areas. The Dean of Students
has stated that this proposal is worthy
of consideration. In summary, I be-
lieve that these six ideas are a starting
point for future expansion, They are
not the limit of our possibilities.

With your help and your support,
we can together lead the class of
1971 towards a lasting and beneficial
contribution to the betterment of
Washington and Lee.

Secondly, | completely support the
idea of giving funds to the Rugby
Club. Right now, a member of the
Rugby Club must supply and maintain
his own equipment. Since the club
does represent Washington and Lee

should be given to them.

Next, I am against the idea of
compulsory Sophomore Dorms. |
think that a sophomore should be
able to make up his own mind whether
he wants to live in a dorm, in a
fraternity house, or in an apartment.

I am in favor of improving the
facilities of the non-fraternity men.
With twenty per cent of the student
body not in fraternities, an effort
should be made to improve and en-
large recreational facilities in the near
future.

Also, each year, one freshman is
elected by the EC to be on each of
the standing committees of the stu-
dent body. | will personally talk to
each person who applies to these com-
mittees to see what their ideas are.
I will then make my recommendations
to the EC. I will devote every energy
to see that imaginative and energetic
men are placed on these committees.
I believe that this is something that is
important not only to our class, but
to the entire school,

Finally, 1 completely support the
Honor System as Washington and Lee
as it now stands.

In closing, | would like to reiterate
that | will always be open to any ideas
any student has, | will devote all of
the necessary time to the office, and
1 will always bear in mind the re-
sponsibility I have to you and to

Washington and Lee.
