Designates

Openings Committees

By BOBBY YEVICH

Dean Kumpuris, president of the
sophomore class and of Openings
Weekend, has mamed twenty vice-
presidents to assist him in making

arrangements for Openings. Kumpuris
chose one Openings Vice-President

from each fraternity and two inde- |

pendent Vice-Presidents,

Kumpuris and Homer Gamble, the
sophomore class vice-president, select-
ed this unusually large number of
vice-presidents so that all elements of
the class would be represented. In
the past few years the number of
Openings Vice-Presidents has usually
been lower than six, and each vice-
president picked students to fill his
committee. Naturally, some fraterni-
ties had no members on any of the
committees. But this year, Kumpuris
has organized his twenty vice-presi-
dents into three full committees.

Cocktail Party

The cocktail party will take place
from 4 to 6 on Friday afternoon of
Openings Weekend. However, the
location, liquor, and entertainment for
the Cocktail party will not be decided
until later this week. The theme for
decorating the gym for the dance will
also be decided this week,

Former Acting Presiden
Dies In Halifax June 25

Dr. Robert Henry Tucker, former

Halifax home at the age of 91

He began teaching at WAL in

ifour years later. Dr. Tucker was
named dean of the College in 1930,
and dean of the University in 1932,
He continued in that capacity until
1946, when he retired from his posts
as dean and professor. He continued
to serve as lecturer in economics until
1950,

and Francis Pendleton Gaines (1930-
1959),

Dr. Tucker's tenure as dean was
marked by a steady improvement in
admissions requirements and instruct-
ional standards. Although he never
sought public office, his career was
notable for its contribution to state
governmeninial function in the field
of education,

Taxation Authority

He was recognized as an authority
on taxation and governmental struc-
ture, and served as the first chair-
man of Virginia's Industrial Develop-
ment Commission (1918-1919) and as
the first chairman of the state Com-
mission on County Government (1930-

 

1932).

new Student Union would not be com-
pleted until March of 1969 the faculty
may decide to allow the present rush
system to remain in effect for another
year,

Senior law student Stafford Keegin,
Contact chairman, said that although
Goldwater would probably be con-
tracted for $2,500, the cost would be
well worth the publicity,

Keegin said that other political
figures and columnists were under con-
sideration to be invited to speak.
Ihe theme of the program will be
“What is the Republican Party?”

Although the faculty soundly passed
a resolution last year in which it
instructed the IFC to defer rush week
until after the first or second semester,
it is felt that many of the faculty
so voted in the belief that the new
Student Union would be completed
by September of 1968.

But the bids were just accepted,
and work will not start until this
winter. The complex is not expected
to be completed until late in the
1968-69 school year. So some chance
remains that the faculty will amend
its resolution to give the IFC one

more year in which to adopt deferred
rush,
The IFC stressed that under the

new rules for pledge training adopted
last year, no work of any sort may
be required of any pledge. Exceptions
to this rule are the memorization of
chapter and national history and
songs, the construction of Homecom-
ing displays, and school-oriented study
halls.

After mid-semester, only those
pledges with 1.5 or better on the
four-point system will be allowed to
attend work days and such. Also,
the IFC has abolished all forms of
Hell Week, Help Week, or any re-
lated forms of activity.

percentage since 1961, Three junior
transfers, two sophomores and an ex-
change student also pledged.

Virtue Versus Vice

Now that Washington and Lee has completed what may or
may not be its last before-classes-begin Rush Week, the Ring-
tum Phi is obliged by tradition to conduct a post-mortem, be-
fore the memory fades too much. It might, therefore, be
appropriate to look at one of the clumsiest, most unenforceable
and most seemingly impractical of all Rush Week regulations—
as an example of the type thing that by merely being on the
books sullies the mame of the Inter-Fraternity Council and
contributes to the IFC’s low batting average of enforcement—
the so-called “dirty rush rule”:

“No fraternity man may use any criticism of any other
fraternity, or its constituent members, in order to build
up his fraternity or to discredit the other fraternity.”

Most houses dirty rush and admit it without reluctance,
at least privately. We know of one house (there may be more)
which had its own no-dirty-rush rule, voted into effect by its
membership, with a $25 house fine for violators. We also
know, however, of at least six houses whose members acknowl-
edge having dirty-rushed at least once this Rush Week. Dirty-
rush “teams” are not unknown. Dirty rush over the summer
is blatant, and probably universally engaged in.

There is, we think, a valid question as to the need for a
dirty-rush rule to even appear on the books. Some opponents
of the rule feel that unlimited dirty rush would in the long
run cancel itself out from house to house. More reasonably,
it can be suggested that dirty rush by a house might just serve
to indicate to a freshman the character of the dirty rusher. No
freshman, we think, would respect an irrational slanderer—and
we would be willing to give W&L-calibre freshmen credit for
generally being perceptive enough to discern what is a legiti-
mate observation and what is not. Certain forms of what is
now considered “dirty rush” could even be of benefit to a
rushee—for example, a frank comparison of house bills, nam-
ing fraternity names and dollar amounts, with a student whose
finances are tight.

It was Bernard Shaw who said “Any vice that cannot be
suppressed should be made a virtue.” While nobody wants to
exalt dirty rush, or make a recumbent statue of it, perhaps
it’s time—particularly with the very real possibility of “Rush
Week” becoming “Rush Semester” in the next few years—to
begin accepting it for what it is: inevitable, and capable of
being seen by nearly everybody for what it is.

DIRTY RUSH

cRESHMAN IGNORANCE of PUsy

 
   

 

By RICHARD H. NASH
President of the Student Body

I have been asked by the editor
of the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi to write
an article outlining the Executive
Committee's expected goals in the
coming nine months. But this is some-
thing that neither | nor anyone else
can predict with any accuracy because
the Committee is composed of 12
members, each member having an
equal vote. Consequently, what is
done or not done during this year
cannot be guaranteed by any one
person.

 

 

Four Honorary
Degrees Given
At Graduation

Retired Gen. Lucius D. Clay was
among four distinguished Americans
presented honorary degrees during
Washington and Lee's 218th com-
mencement in June.

The University also conferred
honorary degrees on Princeton Uni-
versity Professor Whitney J. Oates,
Roanoke, Va., newspaper publisher
M. W. Armistead II], and Leesburg,
Va. attorney Wilbur C. Hall.

Prof. Oates received the Doctor of
Letters degree, while the other three
were presented th Doctor of Laws
degree. The degrees were conferred
on the men by University President
Fred C, Cole, who delivered the
commencement address,

Distinguished Americans
Gen. Clay. who is now a senior
partner of Lehman Brothers in New
York, was cited for both his 31
years of distinguished military service

 

7 and his economic leadership, begun

with his retirement from the Army
in 1949,

The citation noted Gen, Clay's “de-
termination and calm perseverance”
in dealing with the Berlin Blockade
while he was commander-in-chief of
American forces in Europe and mili-
tary governor of the U. S. Zone in
Germany, and again during the Berlin
Wall crisis of 1961 when, as Presi-
Kennedy's special envoy, he
inspired “the people of West Berlin
in their renewed struggle for freedom
and security.”

Prof, Oates was cited “as a teacher
of superior ability (and)... as a
national educator,” Dr, Oates is pro-
fessor of humanities at Princeton, and
was instrumental in establishing the
Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship
Foundation, the National Foundation
for the Arts and Humanities,

Reporter to Publisher
Armistead, who rose from reporter
to publisher and chief executive of
Times-World Corp., which operates
two Roanoke daily newspapers, a
radio station and television station,

labor in behalf of his community, his
state and his country” and for his
“talent, initiative, enthusiasm, (and)
a remarkable ability to accomplish
the difficult task. ‘

Hall's citation termed him “a
lawyer's lawyer” and said “few mem-
bers of the legal profession are
so generally admired and respected,”
An alumnus of Washington and Lee,
Hall was cited as “author and spon-
sor of far-sighted legislation” during
his 18-year term (1918-35) as a mem-
ber of the Virginia House of Dele-
gates, and as a “wise counsellor,
learned scholar (and) devoted public

 

servant,”

 

 

was cited for a “a life of unselfish |

 

E.C. President Presents Issues
Facing The School This Year

What I can do, however, is to point
out many of the issues that I will
personally pursue, or have pursued,
for presentation to the Committee for
some form of action.

Before listing any specific items,
however, I would like to say that I
am sure this year’s Committee will be
much more mindful of student opin-
ion than those Committees of recently
past years. Hopefully, we will all be
able to vote in a manner that repre-
sents the way in which the majority
of the students would vote. This may
not be possible at all times, but we
will make an attempt to do so as
much as we can.

Probably the most pressing problem
that we will confront will concern
laying down certain “ground rules”
involving the Honor System. This does
not mean that we are going to list
and formalize basic rules, but that
there is a need for students and pro-
fessors to communicate better with
each other about what each “side”
considers cheating. This is especially

a problem in the language and math, |

departments.

One of the most important pieces

of legislation that we shall take up
will be the establishment of a more
flexible examination schedule. Each
semester, many students work hard
and do well in a course for four to
five months. Then, during the exam
period, often all is lost because exams
are crammed into a few days. With
a little time and effort, a new system
can be worked out which will alleviate
this problem and will add no extra
days to the examination period,
Another important piece of legisla-
tion to be looked into is the separa-
tion of the School of Law and the
undergraduate schools in certain
phases of student government. Most
law students desire such separation

 

 

because they are not only uninterested
in most of the undergraduate con-
cerns, but also becuse it is also
ridiculous for twenty-four-year-old
law students to be disciplined by nine-
teen-year-old sophomores.

Not so pressing, although it could
become quite beneficial, would be the
establishment of a “press gallery” at
E.C, meetings. This might include a
representative from each fraternity,
one from the Gaines Society, and one
from each law school class. The repre-

 

 

RICHARD NASH

sentatives would attend E.C. meetings
in a “reporter” type of fashion. They
would not participate in the meeting,
but would take notes on all debates,
recording good and bad points on all
issues. Then they would report to
their respective houses, classes, et
cetera, in order to educate the stu-

New Religious
Group To Ally
Work Projects

The newly organized University
Federation of Christian Concern is a
combined effort of the campus de-
nominations to cater to all sorts of
religious interests, Its flexible pro-
gram will include theological discus-
sion and service projects, as well as
programs of a social nature.

The structure of the organization
has been arranged so it can afford
to be comprehensive and flexible with-
out sacrificing an effective organiza-
tion. This has been accomplished by
assigning a denominational chaplain
as advisor to each permanent project,
thereby guaranteeing a sense of con-
tinuity which earlier religious organi-
zations lacked.

These advisors will keep a record
on their projects’ activities, while the
students will be running the show
themselves. The students will thus
have a source of information not
available before.

 

The UFOCC will have a meet-
ing of all interested upperclassmen
Thursday night at 8:30 in the Stu-
dent Union,

 

To be highlighted in this year’s pro-
gram will be intercollegiate forums
and two discussion programs: one
aimed at freshmen, the second at
upperclassmen.

Intercollegiate Activities

The intercollegiate forums are usu-
ally informal meetings involving
W&L and one of the nearby girls’
schools. The guest school will be
treated to dinner following which the
students will go to the chaplain’s home
to discuss some topic of contempor-
ary interest.

Occasionally these discussions will
be more elaborate. For example, last
year Hollins invited W&L and several
other men’s schools to see and
discuss a film on the church's role
in civil rights. Hollins also has a
coffee house open on weekends to
students who wish to discuss sub-
jects not merely of a religious nature
though this project is under the
auspices of their religious association.
The W&L fellowship is very interested
in the possibility of such a project
for this campus.

Discussion Program

The freshmen this year will have
the unique opportunity of a discussion
program led by three area clergymen,
Tom Brown of the Episcopal Church,
Charles Swezey of the Presbyterian,
and Father Carl Reikowsky of the
Roman Catholic. This exposure will
prepare the way for a similar pro-
gram aimed at upperclassmen,

Led by Dean David Sprunt and
Dr. Louis Hodges of the WAL relig-
ion department, and Mr. Swezey, it
will be essentially a series of seminars
for the higher-level W&L religion
courses and will set the stage for
various speakers who have agreed to
come to W&L this year.

The first speaker scheduled is
Joseph Fletcher, one of the theo-
logians behind the “New Morality,”

Doremus Natatorium Cesling

Replaced Over The Summer

The Doremus Natatorium has un-|
dergone extensive renovation over
the summer. The freshmen will now
make their jump for life in a freshly
painted and scrubbed pool.

The most noticable improvement
is a new acoustical ceiling—the third
ceiling the pool has seen. Its first
ceiling was a concrete affair that one
day caved in due to the moisture from
the pool below and the pounding of
the handball court above.

The second ceiling was of tin and

soon became very rusted, as any
swimmer can testify. The pool now
sports an acoustical ceiling which is
four feet lower than the previous tin
ceiling. Coach Twombly hopes that
this ceiling will last for the duration
of the life of Doremus Gym, now
entering its S3rd year.

Other improvements to the pool
include a fresh coat of paint, re-tiling
of the rotted areas of the spectator
balcony, and new window sills which
have been ordered and delivery is
expected in October. A new $700
electric clock has been ordered and
is expected to arrive in November.

The pool itself has been scrubbed
down and the water is in the best
condition that has been seen for many
years. Nevertheless, while the pool
seems brand new, it is still only 23 1/2
yards long.

W&L Generals Face R-M
Yellow Jackets Saturday |

This Saturday the Washington and
Lee Generals will appear in their first
home game of the season against the
Yellow Jackets of Randolph-Macon,
Randolph-Macon is a formidable op-
ponent with 25 returning lettermen
under the guidance of Coach Ted
Berry, now entering his fourth year as
head coach at Randolph-Macon.

The Yellow Jackets’ strong players
are junior quarterback Dave Wetzel
and halfbacks Dennis Toth and Hank
Fien. Wetzel, last season, rushed for
290 yards, completed 72 out of 138
passes for 892 yards and 7 touch-
downs, Toth ended up as R-M’s lead-
ing ground gainer a year ago, getting
526 yards on 121 carries, and caught
14 passes for 122 yards. Fien, on the
other hand, didn’t play as frequently,
but still gained 167 yards on 22 car-
ries, in addition to catching 8 passes
for 132 yards and scoring 24 points.

The Jackets had a 7-1-1 record last
year losing only to Hampden-Sydney
who the Generals had battled to a

3-3 tie. Washington and Lee has no-
where to go but up in this upcoming
contest. The Yellow Jackets have kept
the Generals scoreless in the last
three encounters.

The Generals can always look back
to that glorious day, not too long ago,
in 1916 when they squashed the Yel-
low Jackets 80-0. In the 17 games
between these two teams Washington
and Lee has the definite advantage
with 12 victories opposed to 4 losses
and | tie.

The Generals with more depth and
talent than last year can be expected
to give the Randolph-Macon Yellow
Jackets a tough game.
