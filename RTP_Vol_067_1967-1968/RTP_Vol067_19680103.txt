Huntley Named President

Robert E. R Huntley, dean of the
School of Law of Washington and
Lee University, has been elected pres-
ident of the 219-year-old school by
its Board of Trustees.

Dean Huntley’s selection as the
University’s 20th president was an-
nounced today by Dr. Huston St.
Clair of Surfside, Fla., rector of the
Board. The action took place at a
called meeting of the Board in mid-
December.

Dean Huntley, 38, is an honor
graduate of Washington and Lee and
its Law School and holds the LL.M.
from the Harvard Law School. He
will begin his duties as president at
the start of the spring semester on
Feb. 5, 1968.

He will take over the president's
chair from Dr. William W. Pusey
III, who has been acting president
since Sept. 1, 1967. Dr. Pusey, who
has continued to serve as dean of
Washington and Lee’s College, be-
came acting president when President
Fred C. Cole resigned to become pres-
ident of the Council on Library Re-
sources, Inc., in Washington, D. C.

Dr. Pusey will continue as dean of
the College after Dean Huntley as-
sumes the presidency.

Dean Huntley's duties as dean of
the Law School, an office which he
occupied at the beginning of this
school year, will be reassumed for the
remainder of the year by Prof.

Charles P. Light Jr. Dean Light re-
tired in September, 1967, as dean and

  
 
 
 
 
  

 

DEAN ROBERT E. R. HUNTLEY, named president of Washington and Lee University, gathers with his family

has continued his teaching. Dean
Huntley, a member of the Washing-
ton and Lee faculty since 1958, also
will continue to teach law courses for
the remainder of the school year.
Dr. St. Clair said Dean Huntley
was chosen president from a long list
of candidates considered by a special
selection committee of the Board of

Trustees. The committee worked
closely with a faculty advisory com-
mittee and representatives of the

Washington and Lee Alumni Board of
Directors in finding a permanent suc-
cessor for Dr Cole. Student opin-

ion also was sought.

“We are fortunate that Dean Hunt-
ley has accepted the presidency of
the University,” Dr. St. Clair said.

“Dean Huntley is eminently quali-
fied to lead Washington and Lee
University in the years of opportuni-
ty and challenge before it. He has
youth and vigor, a deep devotion to
his alma mater, and a close ac-
quaintanceship with its people and its
special needs.

“Dean Huntley has excelled as a
teacher and an administrator, and
he has acquired special knowledge
of conditions in American higher
education in his capacities as a pro-
fessor and as legal adviser to the|
University and as secretary of the
Board of Trustees.

“IT am confident that his election
will be greeted w.th enthusiasm by
everyone connected with the Univer-

 

sity and with higher education
throughout the nation.”
Speaking to the press _ this

morning, Dean Huntley indicated
he plans no major departures from
current policies and guidelines for
the University’s development,

Among matters discussed at the
conference: possible graduate pro-
grams af W&L (“No”), fraternities
(Dean Huntley is optimistic about
their potential to adapt without
fundamental change), fulure expan-
sion (not out of the question) and
a development program (about to
be undertaken, with a figure of
“around $25 million” being men-
tioned).

Dean Huntley is the first alumnus
to become permanent president of the
University since pre-Civil War days.
The office of president dates to 1782,
when William Graham became the
first president of Liberty Hall Aca-
demy, forerunner of Washington

College, which after the presidency

of General Robert E. Lee became
Washingion and Lee University in

1871. Five of the school’s 20 chief |
executives since the time of Graham |
have been acting presiden‘s, serving |

only brief periods.
