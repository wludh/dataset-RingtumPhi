Future Plans of Graduates Affected

 

Draft Deferments Cut By New Rules

By NEIL KESSLER
News Editor

The future plans of most of the
students at Washington and Lee,
especially seniors, took an unexpect-
ed turn February 16 when new draft
rules were announced by the White
House.

Under the new rules,
ments are suspended, as a class
“critical occupations” list
pended. Draft boards will now judge
each defernment request on its indi-

job defer
The

is also sus-

vidual merit. Existing job deferments
will continue in force until they ex-
pire under past rules. This may mean
that not only students but also some
of our younger teachers may be call-
ed to serve.

No new deferments for graduate
students will be granted, except for
divinity students and youths study-
ing medicine, dentistry and allied
health specialties. A graduate student
not in these fields, who started his
work toward

degree last autumn, will lose his de-| House source as saying: “The draft's| U.

Danner Lee Mahood, president of
the national fraternity, will speak at
the Norris Dinner. National fratern-

ity Executive Secretary Wililam S
Zerman and Section Chief James

Arthur will also attend the chapter's
celebration.

The first meeting of Phi Gamma
Delta at Washington and Lee was
held February 29, 1868, and, as most
fraternities of that day, it was a
literary society. Readings from Mil-
ton, Byron, Keats and Shakespeare
were discussed at the bi-weekly fra-
ternily meetings

Around the turn of the century the
fraternity changed into a social organi-
zation. Meetings were held in the
Masonic Hall until the purchase of
the chapter's first house in 1912. After
this dwelling was destroyed by fire in
1918, the chapter purchased its pres-
ent home at 112 Preston St

Famous alumni of the Washington
and Lee chapter of Phi Gamma Delta
include Newton D. Baker, 1892-94,
Secretary of War during World War
I, and Benjamin G. Flournoy, 1894

of the most handsome and impressive

What A Difference
50 Years Makes

Enormous herds of naked souls I saw,
lamenting till their eyes were burned of tears;
they seemed condemned by an unequal law . . .

The Inferno, Canto XIV, 13-18.

One wonders if they had the draft in Dante’s day. In any
case, his description is perfect for the scenes which were taking
place among male American college students both here and
probably at every other college in the country this week, when
it was announced that there will be no more draft deferments
for most graduate students and for a large number of persons
in formerly-exempt occupations (see article, page 1).

Actually, the status of most students here is unchanged;
for the past couple of years almost everyone has been aware
that, sooner or later, the draft would catch up with just about
everybody. But in the back of most students’ minds there was
always the thought that something—graduate school, an ex-

 

empted job, an unsuspected heart flutter—would intervene. |
Last week’s announcement, cutting away so many exemptions,
brought a good many people to the realization of just how close

the draft really is. And while that heart flutter may still descend
as a saving deus ex machina, somehow that provides rather cold
and spare comfort. We can’t pretend any more that the war
is a long way off.

It’s interesting to note that fifty years ago, in 1918, W&L
students were facing more or less the same sort of thing. It
was a very different kind of war then (it was easier to believe
that we were making the world safe for democracy), and, not
too surprisingly, the attitudes of the students back then were
quite a bit different. We were fighting “Huns” back then;
nothing so neutral-sounding as “V.C.” or as friendly as
“Charlie.”

The Calyx for 1918 devoted a whole section to Military

“When German duplicity and barbarity passed its men-
acing shadow over our fair land, no wonder that the campus
of Washington and Lee blazed anew with the old fire of
patriotism (of Generals Washington and Lee).

“On the 21st of last March . . . President Smith wrote |
our alumnus, Secretary of War Baker, that we wished to estab- |
lish military training at once. . . . Meanwhile, Dr. Pollard
(head of the P.E. Department) had worked out careful and |
detailed plans for the establishment of a base hospital, utiliz-_
ing for that purpose the Doremus Gymnasium, the Dining |
Hall, Lees Dormitory, the Field House, and Castle Hill Hotel, |
thus furnishing sufficient accomodation for 320 operative cases |
with nurses and attendants. :

“The Virginia Military Institute . . . placed at our dis-
posal the services of Major M. F. Edwards as commandant
with about sixty volunteer cadet officers as assistants. The
student body in mass meeting on April 6, accepted this offer
with enthusiasm, and within the week ninety-six per cent
of the whole student body were actively drilling every day
under this remarkable body of experienced officers.

“Our Ambulance Corps, when called to Allentown, Pa.,
soon won favorable comment and wide reputation. Many
vain offers were made to induce its members to accept officers’
positions in other units. The whole corps is now “over there”
ready for the spring drive, and all know that there is no finer
bunch of American college men in Europe.

“When the present session opened, the President took
as the subject of his opening address, “Our War-time Duties
as an Institution.” To a solemn and attentive student body
he urged that gravity, simplicity, economy, and loyalty consti-
tute the four-fold keynote of university life in these moment-
ous days.

“From an attendance of 531 last year and 381 last Sep-
tember, the enrollment at Washington and Lee has diminished
to about 330. At home and abroad, on land and sea, in every
training camp and aviation center, are to be found the repre-
sentatives of the present body and alumni of Washington and

i

Lee University.

“Full well the University knows that the thick strewn
stars on her service flag will soon be sprinkled with gold. Yet
with mingled pride and sorrow she knows that her sons in
life or in death will prove worthy of the traditions and his-

tory of their Alma Mater.”

important, CONTACT has a duty to
present to the students a program in
which the students have, at least, some |
interest, It seems to me to be patently
unfair to ask the vast majority of the
student body to financially support |

terest, at best, or in which, perhaps,
it has a decided disinterest. In this
respect it appears to me that the
CONTACT Chairman has the re-
sponsibility of assertaining where the
interest of the student body lies, and
upon arriving at his conclusion, he
should attempt to structure his pro-
gram accordingly, This is not to say,
however, that CONTACT is forever

It can and should assert itself in an

By Stafford W. Keegin

A number of questions have been
raised concerning CONTACT, some
of a serious nature and others of
less consequence. I hope this letter |
will answer some of these questions
and, at least, explain the present
posture of CONTACT as, admittedly,
subjectively viewed by its Chairman.

First let me say that but for the
overwhelming contribution of the
Interfraternity Council there would
be no CONTACT. CONTACT is a
creation of the IFC and has been
under its wing ever since, as well it
should be. Ellis Zahra and the Judicial
Board whole, have shown a
continued and constructive interest in
the program. Any failure to give the
IFC the credit it rightly deserves is
mine. If there is any dowbt about
the value of the IFC to CONTACT
it should be dispelled. Almost 50%
of CONTACT operating funds comes
solely from the fraternities. If this
amount were half of what it is, there
would still be due from the student
body a hearty thanks. As it is, how
ever, the IFC this year made a con-
tribution of $2,500 which. by any
standard, is a real sacrifice and those

R. M. S, Titanic...

8 p.m. Wednesday.

Wednesday, permanent officers were
elected, committee reports read and
accepted, and a platform proposed.
The tide already seemed to be running
to Bryan, but Gov. Johnson's forces
managed to delay the proceedings
over adoption of the convention plat-
form.

Delegation caucuses met with Bryan
and Johnson leaders most of Thurs-
day. It was thought Gov. Johnson's
forces would try dilatory tactics
again at Thursday night’s session.

“But when the convention conven-
ed again,” said the R-t P, “the Bryan
men waged an aggressive fight and
spurred on by an overwhelming ma-
jority soon adopted a platform, and
the chairman, amid deafening ap-
plause, announced that nominations
were now in order.”

The names of Bryan, Johnson and
Carmack were placed in nomination.

As the balloting began, objections
were raised as to the conduct of
certain state delegations. The John-
son forces objected to the use of the
unit rule for delegation votes, where
all the delegation’s votes were cast for
one candidate.

 

 

“, .. four years to sink,”

But the Bryan forces had mustered
a majority, and the convention ruled
that delegations must cast votes by
unit rule.

The Johnson men claimed they
were not getting a square deal. “But
to this cry the Bryan men turned a
deaf ear and by their slow and gruel-
ing process lashed the Johnson men
into line,” reported the R-t P.

But as the roll call proceeded,
tension grew. The storm burst at the
calling of Kansas, when a fight broke
out among the delegates (“very char-
acteristic of that state indeed” quoth
the R-t P).

Similar fights broke out in the
delegations of New York, Pennsyl-
vania and Missouri.

But the balloting was completed,
and Convention Secretary W. M.
Johnson began tallying the votes.

Tempers were already high. Some
point was raised (now forever lost to
history). The convention chairman
ruled against the Johnson men, one
must suppose. But we must always
regret not knowing what that ruling
was in view of subsequent events,

G rading Criticized

| To the Editor:

As scholarship chairman of my fra-
ternity, which ranks third academi-
cally, | have been appalled to observe

the arbitrary grading policy of the

Fine Arts Department Chairman. For
some years he has apparently com-
puted student grade averages which
have borne no relationship to mathe-
matical reality.

Cases of the final exam dropping
a student's Fine Arts average from
a B to a D, or from a C to an F,
occur with alarming frequency; and
when the grade is questioned, it is
not unknown for the final exam to
disappear. In fact, at least one case
exists of a semester grade given
which was lower than amy grade
earned by the student at amy point
in the course:

Course:

Fine Arts 101

First hour quiz: K-
Second hour quiz: B+
Final exam: c
Semester grade: D

Although Dr. Junkin claimed not to
have liked the student's attitude, the
student involved, who cut the course
no more than three times, doubts
that the professor even knew him by
name fover 100 students were enroll-
ed in the course),

At least six additional students of
whom I have personal knowledge have
been similarly victimized: that is, their
semester averages were obvious perv-

i
ersions of the component grades. Who |

knows how many others this self-
styled Achilles has dragged around
the walls of Troy?

I have good reason to question this
professor's competence well as
his justice, and | hope that Dr.
Junkin will seriously consider whether

as

of the University for him to retire
at the end of the current semester

In addition, | hope that the admini-

voluminous pages actually had some
newsworthy material in them. A-
typically, its readers were not subject
to the usual “stimulating” stories
about an egg-eating contest, the
Player of the Week Award, or a
“conventional” discussion of the dress
habits of the W&L student. Because
of CONTACT, its articles concerned
men and issues that shape our every-
day lives. Somehow I fail to appreciate
how this is in any way anti-intel-
lectual. And, for the editor of the
“Ring-tum Phi” (whose own paper and
editorials have hardly risen to the
substance of a “Little Audrey” comic
book) to object, seems to me to be
rather absurd.

Indeed, it is note-
worthy that the most stimulating
talk of the entire symposium, by
Robert Novak, was neither reported

in the paper nor covered by one of
its staff.

This is not to say, to be sure, that
Shakespearean Symposiums and the
like should be discouraged. However,
in & community where extra-curricu-
lar intelectual stimulus is somewhat
lacking, it seems dubious that any-
one should object to a program such
as CONTACT. When one is dying of
thirst in the desert, he does not reject
the waterhole for want of Scotch
and soda.

Generals Split

Pirates Shanghai Blue Bid
For Entry Into ‘Big Time’

Playing possibly their best game
of the season, Washington and Lee’s
basketball Generals completely over-
whelmed a hapless Emory and Henry
contingent Tuesday night. This year’s
Wasp team was the same as the one
which defeated the Blue last year
85-83 in overtime. A close grudge
game had been predicted, but from
the opening tap the game was never
in doubt. The final score read 110-65
and for most of the game the Gen-
erals were doubling E&H’s score.

Despite the lopsided score, both
teams fought hard throughout the
contest, and several times during the
first half fights threatened to break
out, as Mal Wesselink was bothered
by several of his frustrated E&H
counterparts. Perhaps the most signifi-
cant incident came late in the second
half when Dave Wolfe, the Wasps’
starting center was thrown out of the
game. After he deliberately fouled
Mike Neer, the referee awarded
Neer two shots. Enraged, Wolfe threw
the ball hitting the surprised referee
in the face. Mel Cartwright was then
awarded a technical shot.

From the start, the Generals dis-
played a fierce desire to avenge last
year’s loss. Inside the first minute
they had taken a 4-0 lead. From there
on the Big Blue proceeded to make
a farce out of the game. By 11:20
the score stood 23-8 and the Gen-
erals were threatening to
three-to-one advantage. Wesselink and

Mel Cartwright (voted Player of the
Year) were hitting beautifully, especi-
ally Wesselink who was hitting re-
peatedly from deep in the corner.
When the half closed the game was
all but over as W&L had seized a
49-24 lead.

The Generals didn’t let up during
the second half either. The Wasps
managed to close the gap to a tight
twenty points during the opening
minutes, largely due to their con-
tinued rought play. Time and time
again Neer and Wesselink were
smashed to the floor by the previ-
ously mentioned Dave Wolfe among
others, but the referees never seemed
to notice.

WAL started stretching its lead
again and with only seven minutes
left had a 33-point margin. It was
at this point that the fouls started
being called. At 5:40 Wolfe had his
run-in with the referee and spent
the rest of the game on the bench.
During the second half the Generals
took 23 foul shots.

It was at this point in the game

rising by the Prayin’ Colonels of
Centre College to take the first
game of the CAC Basketball Tour-
nament being held in Sewanee,
Tennesse. Centre came to within
three points of the Bears in the
second stanza, but the boys from
St. Louis, aided by some question-
able calls by the referees, man-
aged to hold on and came away
with an 85-77 victory.

Wrestlers End Disappointing Season With Loss

air To Close Regular Season

Verne Canfield saw his chances for
back-to-back 20-win seasons for his
General roundballers crumble Wed-
nesday night as East Carloina’s Pirates
demolished the Big Blue 100-73 in
Greenville, North Carolina. The de-
feat left Washington and Lee with a
17-6 mark going into tonight’s CAC
Tournament semifinals, and, coupled
with the recent Florida trip losses,
virtually eliminated all chances of the
Big Blue receiving an at-large bid to
the NCAA College Division Tourna-
ment.

Coming off a stellar performance
against Emory and Henry, the Gen-
erals could not find the range against
the tall Pirates and managed only a
measely 38.6 per cent from the field,
a season low, In the meantime, ECC,
a Southern Conference member that
has been all but impressive in compil-
ing an 8-15 record this year, bombed
the nets at a 49.5 per cent clip.

Mel Cartwright and ECC’s Earl
Thompson each netted 18 points in
the first half, as the Generals kept
within 11 points of their major col-
lege foe. The second half, though, was
an entirely different story, as the
Pirates, with all five starters hitting
in double figures, exploded for 57
markers. East Carolina led by as

 

 

Under the watchful gazes of MIKE NEER, MEL CARTWRIGHT, Bob

A dedicated group of Washington

to a 1267-1249 victory over the
shapshooters of the University of
Richmond Tuesday in Richmond. The
win in the final dual meet of the
season for Sgt. Wesley Field’s gunners
upped their record to 3-4, the best
that a Washington and Lee riflle team
has posted since the 1963-64 squad
finished 4-6-1.

The victory on Tuesday was doubly

Sophomore Steve Unti led W&L
against Richmond, firing an excel-
lent score of 261 (out of a possible
300), which tied him with freshman
Mike Jenkins for the season high
single score. Jenkins had fired his
top total in an earlier match.

High marksman against William
and Mary was sophomore Hugh Guill,
who shot a 252.

Against Richmond, the match was
undecided until the last two positions
fired, with Washington and Lee’s Tom
Salb’s 250 providing the clincher.
Other scores in the match against the
Spiders were Jenkins with 256, Guill
with 253, and Chris Ruby with 247.

Coach Field expressed pleasure
over the outcome of the season, which
was a decided improvement over the
1-6 mark posted last year. “The team
is comprised of mostly sophomores
and freshmen, with one junior,” he

state level, Sen. Thurmond has been
a state senator, circuit judge and was
governor from 1947 to 1951.

In the Senate, Thurmond serves on
the Commerce and Armed Services

On the commerce committee, he

He is a member of the Preparedness

is the second ranking minority mem-

During 1961 and 1962, Sen. Thur-
mond attacked the State Department
for what he described as a “no win"
foreign policy and the “muzziing” of
military officers. His attacks were
aimed at muzziing officers, troop
education programs and seminars for
reservists and the public on the Cold
War.

Sen. Thurmond attacked a mem-
orandum by Sen. J. William Fulbight
of Arkansas urging curtailment of
information on communism to the
military and public, Following this,

vestigated military speech censorship

New Rules Cut

tion the number of their students who
will be 4-F.”

The White House source goes on
further to measure the draft odds for
men coming out of college with their
first degrees in June:

“We estimate there will be 500,000
students who will graduate this June.
Subtract the veterans, fathers, 4-F’s,
hardship cases and service volunteers
from this group, and that leaves us
with about 210,000 youths,

“We think that we probably will
have to take about 100,000-plus, of
these 210,000 men.” Thus, thousands
of grads who become 1-A may not
be drafted, unless there is a need
for more manpower.

rhose responsible for changing the
new draft rules felt that the students
who had been allowed four years’
deferment should share the burden

of the draft like those who were less
fortunate and could not go to college
because of scholastic ability or fi-
nancial reasons. This means that the
practice of drafting the oldest men
first within the 19-26 age group will
continue.

How wil Ithis change affect the
students at Washington and Lee? Will
the approximately 70 yer cent of
WAL students who go to graduate
schools be allowed to finish their
education before fulfilling their mili-
tary obligations to Uncle Sam? Only
time will provide the answers. How-
ever, one sure result will be that
applications to the law schol will
drop, as fewer and fewer students
will be able to continue their educa-
tion. Many returning veterans will
not be able to afford the expenses of
a private law school and will instead
go on to a state university, if, indeed,
they still have the urge to finish their
education.

Even second lieutenants com-
missioned through the Reserve
Officer's Training Corps (ROTC)
will find it tougher to postpone
active duty to attend graduate
school.

A new Army program, which
takes effect (it will not affect cadets
graduating this Spring or officers
already in graduated school), in
1969 will specify certain advanced
degree subjects for which active
duty deferments will be granted.
It will also establish a quota of de-
ferments to be given in each study
area. Previously, the Army fol-
lowed a liberal policy of granting
actice duty delays to almost any
ROTC graduate who pursued an
advance degree.

Those cadets planning gradute stud-
ies in other fields than medicine,
veterinary medicine, dentistry, osteo-
pathy and clergy, will be given a
limited number of deferments in each
subject for which the Army has
specified requirements. Applicants will
be considered on a competitive basis.

On Annual Symposium

(Continued from page 2)

Mock Convention its existence in an
election year would be justified. Thus,
in order that there be a 1968 CON-
TACT, the symposium’s topic was
limited. | do not feel the choice was
erroneous. One merely has to look to
the size and fervent activities of the
campus Y.R.'s, the excitement gen-
erated by the Mock Convention, and
the amount of space the Republican
Party receives in the national press
to realize that topic was both of
interest on campus and timely in
nature. Unfortunately, however, CON-
TACT was unable to secure a segment
of the program consisting of some-
thing other than speakers. This dif-
ficulty may be traced to the fact
that politicians do very little other
than talk.

Last year and to some extent this
year CONTACT has received criti-
cism because it was either to liberal
or too conservative. Often I have been
asked why the program was not more
balanced. It is my feeling that CON-
TACT’s sole duty is to present its
study in as honest a manner as pos-
sible. It has no duty to balance the
program for the sake of merely keep-
ing one element or another of the
student body happy. If the subject of
CONTACT happens to include an
even balance of political philosophies,
the program will be balanced; if it
doesn't, then there should be no at-
tempt to balance it.

It has been suggested that CON-
TACT'’s invivation to other schools to
attend the symposium was at the
sacrifice of the interests of the stu-
dent body. It was my feeling that
it would be to the advantage of
CONTACT and Washington and Lee
to extend such invitations. The invita-
tions were extended after CONTACT
had received a number of inquiries
from various schools. To my knowl-
edge we had on campus at various
times during the symposium delega-
tions from American University,
Catholic University, Hampton Insti-
tute, Madison College, Mary Baldwin,
Swee Briar College, Mary Baldwin,
versity of Virginia. There may have
been more. It was the large delega-
tion from Sweet Briar that caused the
consternation, and | have written to-
day to ask that our invitation to
them be reciprocated for their sym-
posium.

In conclusion, | would like to say
that CONTACT to me has been one
of the most exciting evperiences I
have had in my educational life. It
is my sincere hope that the program
is here to stay, for it is, as I see it,
a contribution by WA&L’s fraternities
to the intellectual climate of the Uni-
versity, The broad based support the
program has received is proof enough
that the Interfraternity Council has |

invaluable service.
