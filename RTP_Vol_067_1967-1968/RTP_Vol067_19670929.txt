Delt Makes Sweet Briar Date
After 38-Mile Ride On Bicycle

By BERNIE FELD

Ever since Robert E. Lee seduced
Mary Custis, a Lexington townie, in
a shady grove on the site where Lee
Chapel now stands, W&L men have
traditionally had a reputation for
going to great length in pursuit of
the opposite sex,

A new pinnacle, however,
reached last Saturday when with
dogged, gutty and somewhat sweaty
determination, a Washington and Lee
sophomore rode a borrowed bicycle
from Lexington to Sweet Briar, Va.

Justin “Me and My Bike” Adams,
a Delt from Bristol, Va., set out from
the Delt house at | p.m. after a
bon voyage party.

Four hours and 38 miles later he
pedalled through the gates of that
haven of southern womanhood, a
trifle weary but his pioneer spirit un-
daunted,

In an exclusive interview, Adams
told the Ring-tum Phi, “I just thought
of the idea and left a few hours later.”

After arriving at Sweet Briar, he

Fraternity Pledging Rules
Will Stress ‘Good Taste’

(Editor's Note: The  Interfra-

, mendation

to the Student Affairs

fernity Council has issued the fol- | Committee of temporary or perma-

lowing directive which clarifies the

acceptable pledging programs for

fraternities.)

No fraternity shall violate the basic
principles of good taste, and a Fra-
ternity will initiate no activity which
will be detrimental to the reputation

of the Washington and Lee Com-
munity.
No initiation or pledge training

activity shall constitute any physical
or emotional hazard to the individual.
Such potential hazards include danger-
ous physical exertion or exhaustion,
physical violence, padling, and other
types of obvious abuse. It is under-
stood that the fraternities will exercise
no jurisdiction over the pledges dur-
ing the following hours: after 11:00
p.m., between 8:25 am. and 1:00
p.m., or while any regular academic
work is scheduled.

No Pledge training or initiation
activities will take place outside the
corporate limits of Lexington with
the exception of such functions
a formal initiation banquet or service
to the Community.

Freshmen may participate in build-

Putting An End To Drama

The Faculty Gets A Chance To Stop Playing Villain

Those who think that all the world’s a stage are likely to
have seen some comic flaws this week in our local scenario of
events at W&L.

Until now, everything about the question of deferring
rush week until the beginning or end of second semester has
followed the best dramatic rules. After appropriate rumblings
of discontent last fall as a prologue, the faculty chorus last
spring called upon the IFC to draw up plans by November
1967 for a deferred rush in 1968-69. The deadlines lent a
properly menacing atmosphere to the situation. The whole
stage, in fact, was nicely set for the death and transfiguration
of rush week by this November—until Monday night’s IFC
meeting, that is, when Dean Atwood mentioned that the faculty
will be asked at its next meeting whether it might want to move
the deadlines back by one year.

The faculty will probably do so. The new student center,
which was originally expected to be completed next spring,
will probably not be finished until much later. A deferred
rush next year would thus leave freshmen high and dry
for a semester or more, without fraternity facilities or an
acceptable substitute. Certainly, no one will argue that con-
tinuation of September Rush Week one more time into its
sixtieth-or-so year will cause unalterable damage. To us, at least,
it seems as though the faculty in fairness could do very little
else than push back the deadline for deferred rush to the
1969-70 year.

All the same, after all the sound and fury of last year’s
resolutions (“the faculty commends the IFC for its study of
pledging activities and for its action in the matter. However,
these changes are not a satisfactory response to the resolution
of the faculty of November, 1966’’) and editorials (“if fra-
ternities were healthy, it would not be necessary to quarantine
freshmen from them’’) the passing of a new resolution modify-
ing the first would come as a rather amusing—and relaxing—
anticlimax.

Frankly, we're glad to see it. One of the most objection-
able aspects of last year’s campaign on the part of both faculty
and students for deferred rush and other fraternity reforms
was the impatience, the hasty condemnations, the near-fana-
ticism, the ax-grinding—in short, the high-tragic atmosphere
of the witch hunt. We hope the summer’s recess and a relaxa-
tion of our deferred rush drama will clear away that atmosphere.

By MIKE NATION

A student, on a sabbatical last year,
remarked that the institution he at-
tended had a radical innovation: there
were females taking courses with

males.

The chances of Washington and Lee
going coeducational seem slight in-
deed. The Lee College proposal would
have been a perfect opportunity for in-
troducing the Opposite sex to educa-
tion in Lexington (one college could
have been female), but the plan has
been deferred indefinitely.

Joint Classes

Let it be proposed that it would
be beneficial in many ways if WAL
would initiate joint classes with one
or more of the neighboring female
institutions, With the completion of
Interstate 81, Hollins and Mary
Baldwin can be reached safely in con-
siderably under one hour.

The logical place to start, for it
would be the least disruptive, would
be with seminars on the junior-senior
level. The instructor for the course
could drive to the other campus tak-

 

would meet once a week for three
hours.
Benefits Rendered

The benfits to be rendered by such
an arrangement are many. At the
junior-senior seminar level, courses
could be offered and taken not norm-
ally available on a given campus,
either because of insufficient interest
or because a professor who specializes
in the particular field is unavailable.

More generally speaking it would
afford an opportunity to associate with
the opposite sex in an academic, in-
tellectual setting, an opportunity all
too rare at the moment. Specifically
for the freshmen, it would mean that
their first and most frequent contact
with girls would be in a serious setting
rather than the combo-party scenario
that it is now for most, and the

Record 628 Register Cars With Murray;
Parking Space Must Be Made Available

By RON KESSLER

More than 628 students have regist-
ered cars so far this year, an increase
of about 100 over last year, according
to University Proctor Bob Murray,
Assuming trends will continue as they
have in the past, the number of
registered vehicles will continue to
increase in the future. In addition, the
number of unregistered vehicles, i.e.,
those which slip by Murray is ex-
pected at least to remain constant,

All of this leads to one very
obvious and very pressing con-
clusion: Washington and Lee has
a miserable parking problem,

Although it is a practical impos-
sibility to determine the exact num-
ber of student parking spaces, due to
the fact that there are no lines drawn
in the areas provided by the uni-
versity, Proctor Murray estimates the
number of spaces at 450. This includes
spaces in front of, behind and on the

 

side of Doremus Gymnasium, along
Washington Street, and on the street
leading to VMI. Some spaces are
also available in the VMI-Marshall
Library parking lot.

It is thus becoming more necessary
to leave earlier for class to obtain a
parking space,

Successful methods to alleviate
the parking strain have been insti-
tuted at other colleges; it is ob-
vious that a new system must be
instituted here.

At the University of Pennsylvania
and other big-city schools where the
parking problem is much more acute
than it is at WAL, the administration
has been forced to permit possession
of automobiles for juniors, seniors,
and post-graduates only. At Penn, it
is a possibility that juniors will be
excluded from possession in the near
future.

factory for W&L. The fact that Lex-
ington is so isolated from the rest
of the civilized world indicates that
cars are important for a satisfactory
social life; if sophomores were not
permitted to own a car, then social
life for them as well as for many
students on scholarship, freshmen,
and others who depend upon those
with cars would be hampered.

Other colleges, such as at Union
College in Schenectady, New York,
simply prohibit students from park-
ing on campus. This system would
only succeed if the entire student body
resided on campus, as they do at
Union.

We must finally turn to the par-
ticular problem at Washington and
Lee. There are two feasible solu-
tions, both or either of which must
be instituted in the near future if
chaos is to be stemmed,

 

This solution would not be satis-

Dean Watt Missing?

Concert-Theater Series 'To Open Oct. 13

By JIM SHOES

When a person becomes a new
reporter for the Ring-tum Phi, he
cannot expect the better assignments
to be his right away. So being a true
believer in the adage “an assignment
is what you make it,” I set off with
pen in hand to do a feature article
on the Rockbridge Concert Theater
Series.

When | was given the assignment,
I was told to contact Dean Waitt in
Washington Hall. Being a new stu-
dent as well as a new reporter, I
had no idea who Dean Watt was
or what his connection with the
RCTS could possibly be. | thought
that upon locating the Dean, | would
be able to solve both dilemmas
simultaneously,

Locating Dean Watt is not quite as
easy as one might think. | first looked
in Washington Hall and his secretary
told me to look for him in his other
office in Howe Hall, At Howe Hall
there was a sign telling all who cared
to look that he was not in. As I
traipsed back to Washington Hall, I
came upon a gentleman who had all
the qualities of a dean. He was
poised, confident, intellegent looking
and so on, I was certain that my
search was over. Upon closer inspec-
tion (I asked who he was) | realized
that not only deans have these traits,
but so do registrars,

Upon my return to Washington
Hall, | not only could not find Dean
Watt, but it was also impossible te
locate his secretary. As I pondered my
dilemma 1 found a brochure explain-
ing the function and purpose of the
RCTS

The purpose is to supply culture-
weak Lexington with culture in the
form of four concerts and two plays.
The first of the 4 concerts is to

additional parking facilities. At the
risk of enraging any local naturalists,
the plots of grass in front of the gym
and in front of the new dormitories
are practically functionless (except
for occasional choose-up football,
baseball, and rugby games) and could
easily be transformed into new areas
for parking, allowing space for pos-
sibly thirty more vehicles.

A few spaces behind the gym that
are presently reserved for the coach-
ing staff could be opened up; surely,
our proponents of physical education
can walk the one hundred yards or
so from the area allotted the faculty,
It is also possible that more parking
space can be constructed behind the
gym.

The most logical, simplest, and
cheapest solution, however, would be
to restrict certain students from driv-
ing to classes by allotting parking
stickers to those who are permitted to
do so.

There is no reason in the world
why those members of Sigma Phi
Epsilon, Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma
Chi, Delta Tau Delta, Kappa
Alpha, Sigma Nu, Phi Kappa Sigma,

Beta Theta Pi, Pi Kappa Alpha,
and Phi Delta Theta, who live in
their respective houses, and stu-
dents living in apartments within
two blocks of the campus should
have to drive to school,

Through rain, snow, sleet, and
whatever, it cannot possibly take more
than five mintes to walk to any class

from any of the aforementioned
houses, This should cut the number
of cars driving to classes by a fairly
large percentage and thus alleviate
much of the problem. After, say
1:00 p.m., parking wonld revert to a
first-come, first-take basis.

In any event, something had best
be done immediately, as parking is
at a premium, and that premium is on
its Way up.

Blue Seeking First Win

 

Generals To Tackle
Rugged Jackets Sat.

By THUNDER THORNTON

Washington and Lee will attempt
to even its football record Saturday
at Wilson Field against an always
tough Randolph-Macon College team.
Ugly rumor has it that the Yellow
Jackets from Ashland, Virginia may
well be the Generals’ strongest op-
ponent of the season, and this sup-
position, together with the home
team’s opening loss to Guilford, seems
to indicate a long afternoon in Lex-
ington for the home forces. However,
the opening home game crowd should
see a different team from the one that
fell to Guilford 35-0.

Coach Lee McLaughlin and his as
sistants have had two weeks to light
a fire under the Generals, and squad
members have been diligently “getting
ready for Macon.” The Big Blue has
several scores to settle with the
Jackets, one of which is the 28-0
shutout defeat suffered at the hands
of R-MC last year. In addition, Andy
Bloom and his offensive cohorts will
be seeking to push a score over
against the strong Yellow Jacket de
fense, something that has eluded Gen
eral ballearriers and receivers for three
consecutive years.

Coach Mac pointed out a need for
“organization” in an interview with
a Richmond paper recently, and prac
tice sessions have emphasized this im

McL aughlin Huddles With Moshe

| portant factor, First game jitters
seemed to be responsible for several
costly errors that presented the Quak-
ers from North Carolina with a couple
of easy scores. Both the “blue”
offensive team and “red” defensive
squads have worked to iron out these
mental errors but also to sharpen and
polish the execution of assignments.
Doing the individual jobs against the
Jackets will be of great importance,
for the visitors are a Green Bay
Packer-lype team—nothing fancy, but
they can kill you with execution,
Explosive Jacket Offense
Pacing the R-MC offense is junior
quarterback Dave Wetzel, a_ triple
threat star who last year guided his
team to a seven win season, with
only one loss and a tie marring the
record. Wetzel has built his reputation
on his ability to throw the sprint-out
pass to a group of fine receivers, and,
when not looking downfield for re-
ceivers, to run the ball on the keeper
or the bootleg. But the Jackets have
the footsoldiers to keep a defense
honest. The best running back in the
R-MC camp is last year’s leading
|} ground gainer, Dennis Toth. Against
| Millersville State last week Wetsel,
| Toth, and Co, rolled up thirty-one
| points in a 31-13 victory.

Every year about this time, Wash-
ington and Lee University head soccer
coach Joe Lyles casually will say
his team will do all right in the com-
ing months if no one gets hurt.

“We have a good little first team,”
Lyles will say, “but we could use
some more depth...a lot more.”

And every year, despite frequent
injuries, the Generals have produced
winners, Last season's record was
8-3-1, the one before that was 7-3-0,
and so on and so forth. In 1964,
W&L was selected to play in the
NCAA regional play-offs.

Well, it’s no different this fall.
| Once again, Lyles has made the state-

 

f | ment, and once again his Generals

| indeed appear to be strong in the

| front ranks but weak in reserves.

| “We're hurting at halfback, on the
| line, and in the goal,” says Lyles.
|“We just don’t have the back-up
| strength,

“We have two reserve goalies, for
example, but they're much too in-
experienced, If we lost Tom Mitchell,
our starter, then it’s all over. It'll be
suicide if we don't have him.”

Mitchell, whom Lyles rates as one
of the best goalkeepers to come along
in years, allowed only 19 points last
year as a sophomore. He's also a
centerfielder during baseball season

“Mitchell's got excellent reflexes,”

Sophomore cand caller CHUCK KUHN, impressive in W&L’s as to Guil-| say Lyles, “and he’s not afraid to

ford, could see heavy action in tomorrow's contest.

Depth Key Factor
For W&L Harriers

Senior co-captains Bob Stack and
Corbet Bryant, undoubtly, have their
hands full this fall as they take over
Washington and Lee’s cross-country
leadership from the graduated Bill
Wildrick and Bill Lowry.

Wildrick and Lowry were the prime
movers last year in helping earn a
3-3 record for the Generals in spite
of some depth problems that cropped
up frequently. Now that those two
are gone, Stack and Bryant will have
to work extra hard to build up their
squad’s strength.

Although Stack has not been a top
runner during the past three seasons,
he does, according to head coach
Dick Miller, have the potential to

non-fraternity freshmen enjoy.

Washington and Lee and the neigh-
boring girl schools lose many pros-
pective students and people who trans-
fer out simply because of the lack
of any coed situation. What is needed
is a set-up that renders the benefits
of both the coed and segregated

to W&L’s. It seems unlikely, on the
other hand, that the powers that be
would permit moving ‘Traveller's

Macon was located where VML is.
Future Relationship

This all raises more general ques-
tions as to the nature of future
relationships between W&L and the

neighboring schools. Rising costs
coupled with the rising relative in-
ability to obtain substantial funds,
directs that further cooperation in
usage of facilities, monetary, bureau-
cratic, physical, and academic, e.g.,
an interlocking library system, as
distance permits, be initiated.

rarity, The Macon defenders are big
and mobile and the scouting reports
remark on their obvious love of
initial contact and pursuit. The combi-
nation of a quick striking offense and
rugged defense has made Randolph-
Macon one of the most feared small
college teams in the state, but the
Generals are eagerly awaiting the
kickoff for a chance to chop the
visitors down a few notches, Coach

Organization

Week

Organization Week will conclude
tonight with the Calyx meeting at 7
in the Student Union and the Civil
War Round Table at 7:30, also in
the Student Union.

According to Steve Saunders, presi-
dent of the Assimilation Committee,
freshman response to this year’s
Organization Week has been rather
slow. The poor response is mainly
attributed to the lateness in the de-
livery of schedules pertaining to the
many activities offered.

Statistics on individual organiza-
tions are incomplete, but a large
delegation of freshman did show in-
terest in the Troubadors.

develop into a real good one. “He's
got plenty of stamina,” says Miller,
“but he'll have to concentrate on
getting to the front sooner, then stay-
ing there. His kick could be a little
better, too, but | think we can remedy
that soon enough.”

Bryant, on the other hand, has been
one of the pleasant suprises. He has
steadily improved over the years, to

-} such an extent that he now must be

considered a favorite in any meet.
He's tall, thin, and has plenty of
endurance, all the qualities of a top-
notch long-distance runner. “We're
real high on him,” says Miller, “He's
worked real hard to become the
performer he is, and there’s no doubt
he'll continue to improve himself.”

The Generals open their 1967 cam-
paign tomorrow in Lexington against
the Spidermen of Richmond. Juniors
Mike Hosford and Ralph Pearcy, both
hampered by injuries, are not ex-
pected to see action, as the depth
problem once again becomes a factor
in W&L’s outlook.

More likely would be a Claremont-

Perhaps this is all a bit far-fetched.
The indications are, however, that

little audacity may be what finally
