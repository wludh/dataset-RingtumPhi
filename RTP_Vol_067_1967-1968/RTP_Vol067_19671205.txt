Yearbook To

Feature

Real WGL Fraternity Life

“A yearbook should reflect
spirit of the institution which pub-
lishes it.” With this philosophy in
mind, Peter Strohm, editor of the
Calyx, plans to issue an annual which
will be different in many ways from
past Washington and Lee yearbooks.

With the help of Farris P.
Hotchkiss, associate director of Uni-
versity development at W&L and past
editor of the Calyx, Strohm has in-
corporated many new ideas into the
next yearbook.

One of the most notable changes
will be in the fraternity section of
the Calyx. In the past there has been

Next Semester

In actions yesterday afternoon, the
faculty approved several changes in
courses for next year and the Spring
semester of this academic year.

In Chemistry, a five hour con-

next fall. The course will be an in-
troduction of physical chemistry.

New Psych Course

A new course in psychological
statistics will be offered next Spring.
The history department will begin a

and intellectual history of the United
States. Also the sociology depart-
ment will teach a new course on the

one large group picture for each fra-
ternity and a brief descriptive article
about the fraternity. In this year’s
annual, however, each fraternity will
have four pictures—one for each
class. The short descriptive story will
be kept, however, and informal pic-
tures of fraternity activities will also
be included.

By using these pictures, Strohm
hopes to show some of the inform-
ality of fraternity life. In these pic-
tures “each person will stand out as
an individual rather than a face in
a sea of faces.”

Some other differences in the year-
book will be in the presentation of
school organizations and the faculty.
Each university organization will have
one large picture of its members, as
was done in past annuals. This year,
however, there will also be some in-
formal shots of each group. These
pictures will hopefully give some idea
of what the organization is like, some-
thing the mass pictures cannot do.

The changes in the faculty section
of the yearbook will result in more
pages with fewer large group pic-
tures than in the other annuals. In-
siead, there will be more pictures of
small groups. The English depart-
ment, for example, will not be crowd-
ed into one picture, but instead will
be shown in several pictures.

Strohm emphasized the fact that
yearbooks are read not only by stu-

Student Affairs Committee
Changes Penalty Decisions

The Student Affairs Committee at
its meeting of November 29, 1967
voted to increase the penalties given
by the Student Control Committee
to the two students involved in setting
fire to fraternity Homecomings dis-
plays.

The student who set fire to the
Lambda Chi Alpha display will be
on complete social probation from
November 27 until June 7, 1968, The
SCC had put him on social probation
until January 19 with a subsequent
term of conduct probation

over the SCC punishment

Ihe Student Affairs Committee in
dicated that it would treat any
further instances involving fire as a

serious disciplinary offense

was

ability at present to offer only “com-
munication between student leaders,”
“experience from others’ problems”
and a possible collective barganing
advantage in signing entertainers,
membership would be in effect re-
quire W&L to give far more than it
could receive.

Possibly ranked high on the list
of things W&L would give to the
VASG, Nash said, was the prestige
lent VASG by the University’s name.
About 25 of Virginia’s 49 colleges
have joined.

Last night’s vote came on a motion
by senior Jody Kline to reject mem-
bership with the understanding the
matter would be reconsidered at a
later date when the organization be-
gins to acquire specific direction.

Nash announced the faculty's
Courses and Degrees Committee con-
sidered the EC’s mid-semester test
reform proposal but did not vote on
it—and Nash reported C-&-D Com-
mittee chairman Dean William J. Watt
is not optimistic on a favorable dis-
position of the EC petition.

Nash quoted Dean Watt's reasons:
It is felt to be undesirable to
discourage administrative mid-term
grades “more than they are already
discouraged,” with the _ significant
exception of perhaps allowing the
option of using simple “P” for pass
and “F” for failure at mid-term.

The prospect of a mid-term “exam
period,” designed to avoid jamming
a number of tests into a couple of
days, but in effect requiring all pro-
fessors to give mid-term tests where
many now do not, was not received
favorably.

Discontentment of the Day

7 7 7 7 7 r

OUR OWN BEHEMOTH

We were going to write a vitriol-filled editorial this week
on the noxious, outrageous, oppressive, malignant bureaucracy
in our rural, rustic little college—but we read an article the
other day that took some of the wind out of our sails. The
story told of a group at the University of Maryland that wanted
to circulate a newsletter on campus, and to do so was required
to petition—get this—the “executive director of the office of
the Executive Dean for Student Life.” (And he turned down
the group’s request.)

Somebody once bothered to figure out that Washington
and Lee has more committees and administrative sub-bodies
per capita than the entire federal government. Simply chang-
ing a course requires the approval of a very, very large number
of exceedingly hard-to-locate people: various faculty advisors,
sundry departmental chairmen, one or more deans, and in-
evitably, a fee-collector in the registrar’s office (all roads led
to the registrar’s office). Changing one’s major, especially
into or out of the Commerce School, is an experience of in-
expressible wretchedness, vilely complicated for the student
who has a double major, one inside and one outside Com-
merce. There is absolutely no communication, not to mention
even the barest coordination, between the committee that
decides whether or not to give students who request it an extra
day of absences before or after a vacation. and the committee
that passes judgement on students who take extra cuts without
the first committee’s approval.

We don’t mean to belittle the work of the faculty commit-
tee members; any belittling is done by the anachronistic pro-
cedures of most of the committees, and the fundamental func-
tions of a couple of the others. The Committee on Courses
and Degrees, one of the whistle-stops on the tour of a change-
of-major request, is so wound up in red tape that it generally
has to meet weekly to keep up. Approval of a change-of-major
is automatic on the part of the committee; the petitioning stu-
dent doesn’t even have to give a reason (which is one of the
few aspects of committee procedure that ought to be left
alone). It is not strictly proper, we think, to require two deans,
one administrator and six professors to take substantial time
for their other activities this often for that purpose. And the
C-&-D Committee is not at all alone here.

But still, things aren’t impossible. One can, if he puts his
mind to it, track down the necessary endorsers for a course
change in one or two days. It takes somewhat longer for a
change in major, but that’s all right, too. Please, though just
keep us from the day when we have to register the Ring-tum
Phi with the executive director of the office of the Executive
Dean for Student Life, and we'll be happy enough.

AND A LITTLE CONTENTMENT

We find last night’s vote by the student Executive Com-
mittee overwhelmingly rejecting membership in the Virginia
Association of Student Governments—which wanted us to
associate with and lend our school’s good name to a non-
selective collection of motley Virginia colleges including the
very dregs of Commonwealth education but not the best,
without recompense or benefit of any sort to us, and with no
control over what the V. A. S. G. would attach to our name—
a most satisfying decision.

Early Ring-tum Phi Met Criticism
For Printing “Scandalous Verse”

Back in the days when telephones
(all 68 of them in Lexington, an
advertisement boasted) were known
as “up-to-date electric call bells,”
back when stealing a bell-clapper was
called “a naughty-one’s frolic,” in the
same year that the New York Post
conferred on this city (really) the
title “Athens of the South’—there
came into being a little newspaper,
published weekly “by the students,
for the Washington and Lee Univer-
sity community,” and named after the
most popular of that University’s foot-
ball cheers: “Ring-tum Phi.”

The Collegian had this to say of
the Ring-tum Phi:

“Coincident with the administra-
tion of President Wilson begins the
career of a new publication at
Washington and Lee, the Ring-tum

Phi. The Ring-tum Phi is a weekly
journal and presents a pleasing ap-
pearance. It meets a distinct need in
the University and relieves the Col-
legian of what formerly has tended
only to clog and retard.
Literary Magazine

“The Collegian is primarily a
literary magazine, and when the
editors heretofore were forced to
cram in a_ limitless number of
locals, they always bewailed the
dismal incongruity. Henceforth, we
rejoice to say, the Collegian is
freed from matters of this kind,
and will not be compelled to try to
serve two ends at once...

“Gentlemen of the Ring-tum Phi,
you have our best wishes. Gentle-
men of the Ring-tum Phi, we give
you our sincerest thanks. Students
of W. and L., we congratulate you
on the advent of the long needed
weekly!”

The year was 1897, The Southern
Collegian was still a high-quality
magazine, being published by the Gra-
ham Literary Society. The Ring-tum
Phi was designed to be a somewhat
lighter, perhaps even ribald, comple-
ment to the Collegian, (Curious, how
the two publications’ positions of re-
spectability have made a pair of 180-
degree turns... .)

Eighteen and ninety-seven. The year
the football coach had to send away
for a special noseguard “to protect
the colossal proboscis which acom-
panies Mr. Fitzhugh’s countenance.”
(“Mr.” Fitzhugh was a student; every-
body then was Mister or Doctor or
Professor of Reverend.)

Scandalous Verse

Eighteen and ninety-seven. The year
of the Great H--] Scandal. It seems
the very first editor-in-chief, George
Houston, in he fourth issue of the
neophyte newspaper, published a
column of “Foot-Ball Songs,” one of
which concluded with this verse:

“Each other's back, boys,

“Has got a knack, boys,

“For making gains, sit,

“Round the end.

“And it’s a sin, sif,

“For Oberlin [a WAL player], sir,

“Then join the yell, boys,

“And yell like h--l, boys,

“Sure enough.

Volume I, Number 1

writer (we told you things haven't
changed much) said:

“There appeared in the columns
of the Ring-tum Phi, last week,
a song which, to the thoughtful
person had very little to recom-
mend it.... The only thing that I
can see that would have recom-
mended it to the editorial eye is
the little smack of naughtiness
which makes the first rhyme in the
last verse.

“The Editor seems to be filled
with pride to even know the au-
thor; he puts the verse in the first
column of his newspaper, and
writes an editorial commending it
as ‘especially good.’ He says the
words tire the voice very little.

“Now everyone, who knows
anything of the subject, knows that
the sound of that ‘h’ has a very
rasping effect on the vocal chords.
How much better it would have
been had the line read: ‘And yell
right well, boys.” It would have
sounded better, been easier on the
voice, and would have saved the
writer and Editor from showing
off their weakness.

“It can be admitted that, to some
eyes, there is something worthy
of admiration in a dark, purple
crime, but to bow before a sinlet
like this is weakness personified.

“In the future let me suggest
that the Editor follow the path of
virtue. He will not only find it
pleasant, but may keep himself
from showing his lack of taste,

City’s Christmas

Parade Heralds
Holiday Season

Lexington opened the Christmas
season for its 8,500 inhabitants last
Friday night, with one of the biggest
parades for a city of its size.

The parade drew as many as 20,000
who lined Main Street from Tetlow’s
down to the Court House to watch
over 30 locally-built floats.

There were floats from most of the
businesses in Lexington, as well as
from high school, church and civic

groups. Santa Claus rode on they

Jaycee float.

There can be no value judgments
as far as the comparative quality of
the floats is concerned, except to
say that all were as well done as in
most big city parades. But the longest
float was that of an instrumental
group from Buena Vista, who _ had
two flatbed trailers, half of the
group on each,

Any parade would be incomplete
without girls, and Lexington’s
Christmas parade certainly had its
share. There were several groups
of majorettes, and most notably seven
area representatives.

These included Miss Rockbridge
(Miss Jean Ann Sheridan of South-
ern Seminary), and six girls from
other local schools.

Lexington Mayor and W&L’s sup-
erintendent of buildings and grounds
D. E. Brady was parade marshal
along with Charles W. Gunn, Jr.,
of the State Legislature.

This year Lexington’s downtown
area is more decorated than ever.
Lights were strung over the streets,
and as last year, there are whiie
candles in most of the windowg in
the area.

The Christmas tree in the Court-
house Square was first used last De-
cember, and is being lit again this
year with white lights.

Many of the bands, floats, ma-
jorettes, and assorted marchers were
from areas outside of Lexington—
Staunton, Clifton Forge, Roanoke,
Covington, Natural Bridge and Lynch-
burg. The Lexington Christmas
parade has grown each year to date
and is one of the best-known of its
kind in Virginia.

Roundballers Win Opening Test
Face R.P.I. In Doremus Tonight

Friday night the Generals opened |
the 1967-68 season with an impressive
win over a_ stubborn Bridgewater |
team. Mel Cartwright led the Gen-
eral’s scoring with 27 but game honors
were captured by Jim Upperman of
Bridgewater who had 29. The Gen-
erals were without the services of |
point John Carrere who missed his
first game in his career at W&L; Nor-

 

wood Morrison started in his place
and did an admirable job. The Gen-
eral’s bench strength was made evi-
dent as Coach Canfield continually
rotated his “big men” giving each a
short rest throughout the game. It
was this bench strength that eventu-
ally proved too much for the Eagles.

The Generals grabbed the lead
after a few minutes of the first half

 

Player of

 

the Week

Rob Bauer

With only one game to judge
performances by this week's choice
for “Player of the Week” was a
difficult task. Outstanding candi-
dates were Mel Cartwright, Stu
Fauber and Rob Bauer. However,
because of his performance at a
critical point in Friday’s game,
this week’s choice is Rob Bauer.

Rob is a junior from Largo,
Fla., and is in his thired year on
the varsity. Although he didn't
see extensive action last year,
year before last he was a standout,
leading the team in scoring with a
15.4 average. He also held the
record in about every other de-
partment. Last year Rob was hob-
bled with a knee injury but an
operation last spring has seem-
ingly left him in fine shape.

In Friday night’s game against
Bridgewater Bauer scored 10
points in the crucial closing stages
of the second half and did a good
job of keeping Jim Upperman
from getting the ball. It is with
a great deal of pride that the Tues-
day Edition cites Rob Bauer for
his outstanding contribution in
Friday's game.

Grapplers Win Fri.;
Lose Saturday

By MARK BROMLEY

Washington and Lee's wrestling
team opened its season this past
weekend and achieved a record of

one win and one loss. On Friday,
the first event matched the Generals
against Gallaudet College of Wash-
ington. The result was a 28-8 victory.
The next day, the team suffered its
first defeat at the hands of Towson
State. The score was 26-11.

Standouts of the wekend matches
included Dan Webster (177 Ibs.) and
Jay Clark (191 Ibs), who scored the
only double victories for W&L.

The team, led by co-captains Bob

Payne and Don O'Hare, is com-
posed of ten members. They include:
Razz Rasberry, Whitney Morrill,

with Fauber, Morrison, and Cart-
wright wielding hot hands in the point
department. However, as the half
came to a close Bridgewater managed
to tie the score at 42 all. The second
half started off poorly for the Gen-
erals with Upperman pouring in
point after point. The Generals man-
aged to keep up only because of the
fancy shooting of Mel Cartwright.
At one point the Generals were down
by 7 points. It was at this point that
Rob Bauer entered the game and
began a superb job of defense on
Upperman. He guarded Upperman
so well that he seldom got the ball
and when he did he had to force his
shot and his shooting percentage fell
way off. Bauer didn’t stop with just
defense as he contributed four field
goals and two foul shots to help the
Generals regain the lead that they
never again lost. Rob played in a
manner reminiscent of his freshman
year when he was All State. Though
it is doubtful that he will get too
many starting assignments this year
his role will be a major one if he
continues to play in such a manner.

Coach Canfield called the game a
“fine effort” on the part of all the
players and said that the mistakes
made were easily correctable before
the next game. He also added that
the team shouldn't be too dependent
on the fine outside shooting that was
present Friday night but that they

‘will have to be prepared to work the
| ball into one of the big men under-

Rifle Teams Wins in D.C.

The Washington and Lee Rifle
Team won its first match of the sea-
son on Friday night against George
Washington University. The contest
was extremely close but ended with
Washington and Lee in front 1191-
1203. This difference in score amount-
ed to just over one well placed shot
of the 300 rounds fired by each team.

Sgt. Fields, coach of the rifle team,
(known to every ROTC student on the
drill field), attributed the victory to
a strong team effort. He acknowl-
edged that the George Washington

riflemen had shot a fine match.

Hugh B. (for bullseye) Guill, soph-
more from Washington, D. C., had
the leading score of 257.

he rifle team has been practicing
for a month, two or three times a
week, at the VMI indoor range where
the contest was held.

Swimmers Lose

The Generals’ swimming team lost
a close contest to American Univer-
sity by the score of 57 to 47. The
meet was still in doubt until Amer-
ican managed to squeak by with a
slim victory in the last event.

Coach Stearns’ swimmers all
formed to the best of their ability
in the season’s first meet. Billy Ball,
Pat Costello, Dave Kympton, and
Ross Forman combined to win the
opening 400 yard medley relay with
a time of 3:56.8.

The Generals next first came with
the one-two punch of co-captain Noel
Clinard and Mike Carrere in the
diving scoring 176 and 167 points
respectively. Bill Brumback continued
his blistering pace by winning the
100 yard freestyle with a time of
51.3 which bettered the team rec-
Parker Moore.

Billy Ball scored again winning the
200 yard backstroke for the Gener
als with a time of 2:18.2; Ball also

Tuesday, p.m.

By RIC BERARD

Over the past weekend, one of
Washington and Lee’s least discussed
but, percentage-
wise, most success-
ful teams lost their
season Opener to
American Univer-
sity, 57-47. Natu-
rally, | am refer-
ring to that often
ignored paragon
of athletic prowess
at W&L, the swim-
ming team, which,
to the disbelief of
many, possesses a
gaudy 171-81-1 cumulative record.
Coached for only the second year by
Bill Stearns, the Generals want to
equal or better their 6-3 record of
last season.

Building Year

However, this year appears to be a
building year for Stearns and his
young squad. (There are only two
seniors on the team.) In discussing
this season’s prospects, Coach Stearns
suggested that “Individually, this team
has a great deal of talent, and many
school records will fall. However, |
am going to wait and see about the
team record, although all of us antici-
pate a winning season.” And, in terms
of last Saturday, the coach seems to
have hit the nail on the head.

With respect to the team’s overall
performance, Stearns was principally
referring to opponents such as West

varsity squads, Yet, led by co-captains

 

there is no dearth of talent.

With Clinard diving and Billy Ball,
Bill Kimmel, Ross Forman, Scott Me-
Elroy and Dave Kympton swimming,
the Generals are in possession of some
excellent talent, in addition to a Phi

Delt quorum. But the strength of this
team is going to be found among the
freshmen. In addition to frosh Mike
Carrere and Hal Catlin, there has
emerged Doremus’ first indigenous
aquatic, a Mr. Bill Brumback, who it
is claimed needs only to be placed
into the water in order to break a
record. (In preseason trials, he only
broke five school marks.)

Bright Future

So, in spite of the General’s tough

loss to American U., the season

isn’t over yet. If Coach Stearns can

ceptionally bright. But it’s not just
talent that distinguishes Stearns and
his team. For in watching the prac-
tices, they can easily be confused with
the “tall ones” upstairs in terms of
desire and spirit. And since a little
hard-earned self-pride never hurt any
team, you hafta like the odds on ’em,
particularly as they combine their
personal desire, respect for Stearns
and their own unquestioned talents in
forming a team effort and morale.

It's unfortunate that only three
home meets are scheduled this season
although we readily concede that we
do possess a huge home advantage
with our special 2342 yard long pool.
(After all, it’s pretty frightening to
those of us at W&L, too.) Luckily
though, the next meet will be here,
on Saturday of this week. If you want
to see some outstanding swimming,
the team will be competing against
Gettysburg at 1:00.

Co-Captains:
Wolf,

MacKenzie

Juniors John Wolf and Scott Mac-
kenzie have been selected Washing-
ton and Lee University football co-
captains for the 1968 season.

Wolf, the Generals’ candidate for
Little All-Aemica honors this fall,
finished the nine-game campaign with
78 tackles and 56 assists from his out-
side linebacker spot, while Macken-
zie, W&L’s defensive left end, rank-
ed as the Generals’ most improved
layer during the year.

“We think the team has selected
two fine young men,” said W&L head
coach Lee McLaughlin. “Both players
are outstanding football performers
and their leadershi ability has been
demonstrated both on and off the
field.”

It is the first time in four years
that the Generals have gone with co-
captains from the same unit.

W&L’s Missing Mace

in the old Lexington Fire House.

Asked about the whereabouts of
the mace, Mr. Coleman, the university
librarian, replied: “I don’t know . .
it's one of the University’s mysteries.”
Dr. Starling, University Marshall,
who carries the mace at the head of
university processions, also said that
he knew nothing about the where-
abouts of the mace.

The mace is under the custody of
Mr. Douglas E. Brady, Director of
Buildings and Grounds and Mayor of

by the advice of Mr. Hotchkiss,
Strohm believes that this annual will

about W&L. He hopes that in it he
can “capture the spirit of the Uni-

Professor Chaffin feels that W&L
has high quality students who be-

willing to work at it. This too is a
reason for the team’s great successes.

“Silver-Collecting”

Leading the silver-collecting is the
two-man team of Tommy M. Bare-
more, a senior from Shreveport, La.,
and Christopher H. Mills of Denver,
Colo. Not far behind are senior Hal
Higginbotham of Shreveport, A. M.
(Rusty) Meyer, Jr., another senior,
and freshman R. Timothy Wright,
both of Houston.

Mills and Baremore won the UNC
meet with a 7-1 record, reached the
semifinals at Emory before bowing
with a 9-2 mark, and went to 46-0
last weekend to capture the meet at
UVa.

In addition, Wright won the firs*
place affirmative award, Meyer was
second, Mills was second on the
negative side and Baremore was
third. In extemporaneous speaking,
Baremore was first and Meyer second.

In previous years Mills and Bare-
more have won numerous other de-

.| bate trophies, either teamed together

or with others. “They have accumu-
lated more awards than any other two
debaters we've ever had,” notes
Chaffin.

Generals won by a score of 89-84
with Lyn Creech scoring 24 points
for the Rams. However, this year
they will be without the services of
Creech who encountered academic
difficulties last semester and is in-
eligible for play. R.P.I. won't be a
push over though, as they have a
couple of big boys who can jump
as high as the sky.

This weekend the Generals journey
to Ashland to participate in the Ran-
dolph-Macon Christmas Tournament.
Their opposition consists of Macon,
Lycoming and Maryville.
