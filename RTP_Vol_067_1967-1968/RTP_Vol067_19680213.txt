Goldwater,

Political Columnist Forsees
Nixon Convention Win

By STEVE WITTMANN

Political analyst Robert D. Novak
conducted a seminar in the law school
Saturday as part of the Contact
program. Novak discussed the com-
ing presidential elections in a ques-
tion-and-answer period.

Novak is a columnist for the
Chicago Sun Times, and his column
“Inside Report” is syndicated in 160
newspapers five times weekly.

The question “Who will get the
Republican nomination next summer?”
opened the seminar. Novak said that
he thought Nixon would get the
nomination, but that Gov, Rocke-
feller had the best chance of defeat-
ing President Johnson. He added that
Nixon has a chance of winning the
election because of Johnson's current
unpopularity. Novak feels that Gov.
Romney has no chance for the nomi-
nation,

Nixon's Chances

Questioned about Nixon's chances
for nomination, Novak said that Nixon
must win all the primaries to get
national confidence and consequently
the nomination, Nixon must also come
up in the polls and close gaps of 7-
10% between his popularity and)
Rockefeller’s and that of the Presi-
dent’s. A loss in any of the primaries
will seriously endanger Nixon's
chances for the nomination.

When asked about the “New Nix-|
on,” Novak replied that Nixon feels |
that if he cracks a few jokes from
the podium his popularity will soar.
Novak said this is not true. Nixon
is more relaxed and projects a bet-
ter image than he did in 1960, and
consequently he is more popular
now. But this does not efface the
fact that he must make ground against |
LBJ. Novak feels that Nixon should |
say that he feels the war is a dis-|
aster and that he wants to do some- |
thing about it. |

Because of the Viet Nam War, |
Johnson slipping in popularity; |
Bobby Kennedy and the Republicans, |
especially Rockefeller, are climbing.
Novak said that Rockefeller has no
professed policy, and so his is re-
garded as a “do-it-yourself” policy: |
that is, the people decide for them-
selves what they think Rockefeller

thinks, and so he maintains support

Lubell And Novak End
Contact’s Pachyderm Symposium

Romney: ‘Ambiguity,’
According To Poll-Taker
By LARRY HONIG

Self-styled newspaperman and “non-
professor” from Columbia University
Samuel Lubell spoke Saturday after-
noon on the Republican party—its
troubles, current status, future pos-
sibilities; and he set forth some con-
clusions about the American political
system in general.

Lubell said that the G.O.P. was in
better stead with the nation now than
it was in 1964, but that the party's
current popularity may be due too
much to the dissatisfaction with Presi-
dent Johnson.

Must Understand Change

The Republican presidential candi-
date must, emphasized the short and
quick-witted speaker, understand the
processes of change which are to-
day so much a part of American
society. And an understanding of the
essence of change, said Lubell, should
not automatically suggest the spend-
ing of more money, as he feels the
administration is now doing,

Lubell, agreeing with Barry Gold-
water, noted that the G.O.P. must

offer an alternative to the Democratic |

leadership—but it must be timely.
The people must be expected to make

more an dmore decisions, as opposed |

to increasing governmental control.
Goldwater's Difficulty

According to Lubell, Goldwater
defeated himself on two counts: first,

| he had solutions for too many prob-

lems, which by necessity alienated a
lot of voters; and second, he did not
know how to handle people

Extrapolating these disadvantages
to the upcoming campaign, Lubell said
that the Republican candidates must
be a man who is intelligent and can
manipulate a lot of facts, ideas, and
problems without losing sight of the
overall picture.

Unification Needed

“What is needed is some man, some
party, some program to unite the
country,” Lubell continued, since
“every eletcion is a test for the uni-
fication of the country.”

He said that the candidate who can
so unite the country is at a disad-
vantage because both parties currently

suffer from too much _ ideology.

Ideology is to Lubell a fixed position,

which simply will not work in

Goldwater’s Conservatism:
Apple Pie and Motherhood
By BILL WILKERSON

In a speech distinguished more by
comment than by content, Barry Gold-
water lambasted President Johnson,
Republican liberals, Robert McNa-
mara, Gov. Rockefeller, Gov. Romney
and the American press, The only
things left sacred were apple pie,
motherhood, and the American flag
(which rises electronically overy
morning over the Goldwater adobe
home.)

The major thread of Goldwater's
argument was that the platform used
in the 1964 convention reflected no
major differences from the Republi-
can platform of 1960 and was, in
fact, a strengthening of the basically
liberal positions of that document
Mr. Goldwater somehow seemed to
fail to “out-liberal” the liberals.

Mr. Goldwater, in his speech, con-
tinued his effort to commit the Re-
publican Party to a policy of con-
servatism that would disappear to con-
demn it to a constant position as
an also-ran and would help the two-
| party system by killing it.

 

Platform Similarities
The similarities between the plat-
forms were described as follows:
“In foreign policy, both took a
hard line against Communist aggres-

sion. Both linked the freedom of
America to the future of free nations
in Europe, Latin America, Africa, the
Middle East and Asia... In domestic
matters, both platforms were equally
pledged to the development of indi-
vidual capabilities. Both were pledged
to making government live within its
means. Both demanded priorities for
spending. Both were opposed to deficit
spending except in times of national
emergency.”

In the imbroglio of civil rights,
Goldwater asserted that the 1964 plat
form strengthened the position of the
1960 platform in the rights of mi

entertainment on college campuses
had raised the cost for a performance
up very rapidly even within the last
year,

For example, the Four Tops, which
$2300 last year, now can de-
almost $10,000 for a single
entertainment, Other groups
risen almost as dramatically,
with many increasing their prices as
soon as they have recorded a record

On an operating budget of $32,000,
it is very difficult to provide 8 nights
of entertainment with more and more
groups accepting only a percentage

THE RING-TUM PHIL

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s 'wice-Weekly Newspaper

Tuesday, February 13, 1968

To the other E. C.

We hope that last night’s Executive Committee (of the student
body) resolutions regarding the Mock Convention—the dec-
laration of the extraordinary quality of the quadrennial affair,
and the request that Mr. Saunders be permitted to retain official
management of it (because he would have to, anyway, un-
officially, and everybody knows it)—will be accepted by the
Executive Committee (of the faculty) as being fair and in the
unquestionable best interests of Washington and Lee.

 

The (Un) Co-op

More this year than before, it seems, there is a general dis-
satisfaction, here and elsewhere, with the prices demanded for
textbooks in college bookstores. Newspapers at other schools
have almost unanimously printed exposes written by students
of outrageous markups, and lame refutations written by the
booksellers. Now comes the Ring-tum Phi to ask, Is it necessary
for our University-owned textbook shop to charge $6.25 for
a 300-page paperback?

A couple of incidents, in addition to the general first-of-
the-semester murmur of discontent, make us question whether

prices couldn’t be a little bit lower. We saw one student pay |

$9 for an English text, go outside, and open the book up to
find this notice pasted by the publisher on the inside front
cover: “Dear Mr. Book-Dealer: This book is sent to you with
our compliments. List price: $7.95.” Everybody has experi-
enced, or at least heard tell of, similar instances. The ultimate,
perhaps, involved the group of students who discovered it
was cheaper for them to buy, collectively, one copy of the text
and then each of them xerox it, than for each of them to buy
a separate copy.

The University long ago quit calling the supply store a
“co-op.” The reason is obvious. The necessity of it is not.

Wayward Traveller

The Lexington News-Gazette printed this little item last week:
“A good many people have wanted to know in the past few
years what had been done with the bones of Traveller, Gen-
eral Lee’s horse, which were formerly in a room of the museum
in the basement of Lee Chapel. Information comes from Wash-
ington and Lee that the skeleton is in storage beneath a fresh-
man dormitory.”

Not long ago, a Weekly-Reader-type magazine published
for school children by the National Geographic Society de-
voted a page to Traveller. They weren’t very enthusiastic at
all in reporting that neither the remains of Traveller nor a
suitable monument can be seen by visitors to this University.

Presumably, Traveller’s exile is the result of the want of
room in Lee Chapel (where the skeleton was on display until
the renovation of the Chapel six years ago), and/or the crass
maudlinness of showing off the bones of any animal who has
been dead for 96 years. There is, after all, some difference
(and certainly not wrongly so) between people’s emotive re-
actions to Traveller and to a common brontosaurus.

Even both of last year’s Ring-tum Phis felt something
ought to be done. One editor suggested interring Traveller
close by the Chapel and erecting an appropriate marker; the
other editor said that if something of that order cannot be done,
perhaps we ought to give the bones away to some respectable
institution where their presence would be appreciated more than
it apparently is here.

Come what may, though: as long as Traveller remains
relegated with the infirmary to the bottom of the new fresh-
man dorm, there will be no peace for Stephen Vincent Benet,
who wrote in 1929;

Comes Traveller and his master.

... They bred such horses in Virginia then,
Horses that were remembered after death
And buried not so far from Christian ground.

This week, we turn from “The
Great H--1 Scandal of 1897” (Dec.
5) to less troublesome matter (wine,
women and song), as chronicled in
the Ring-tum Phi before the turn
of the century, Second in a series,

In 1899, Randolph-Macon Woman's
College was only eight years old
(imagine pre-1891 W&L without either
R-MWC or the R-t P!). The one
infant, nevertheless, felt moved to
write of the other: “Out of about 200
students, there are only five full grad-
uates, which speaks well for the high
standard, Oh, my! what can
| we say? They are the ‘all rightest’
girls we have seen, and we will call
again, when W. & L. U. goes to
Lynchburg to play Harvard.”

One is led to suspect that this
may be a reaction to the previous
year’s editorial bent, when under the
headline “A Warm Debate On A
Hackneyed Subject,” the Ring-tum
Phi wrote, “The topic was, ‘Resolved:
That it is better to have loved and
lost, than never to have loved at all.’
The judges announced their decision

Yes, it was a very good year. “One
| Professor, we see, has a nice patent

ing. This is the result of the kindly
| forethought of some student who was
‘anxious, lest one of his instructors
should contract consumption, while
thoughtless staying out too late in his
swing some chilly fall afternoon.
That is the way so many of our people
come to their death, so we encourge
such kindly regard... .”

Successors to Gordon Houston,

Thomas J. Farrar (1898-1899; who,
incidentally, went on to earn one
of the few Ph.D.s ever awarded
by this University), J. Randolph
Tucker (1899-1900) and William J.
Lauck (1900-1901). We dared not
check to see whether Ring-tum Phi
editors Messrs. Farrar, Tucker and
Lauck were kin to the Farrar,

and even now are highly placed in
University officialdom.

‘La Belle Epoque’ And The
Infant Ring-tum Phi Part: I

was so realistic, a typical Ring-tum
Phi review would tell, “that Mr. Barc-
lay found himself at a loss for words,
until a loud whisper, from the back
of the stage, recalled him to his
thespiatic task.”

But the real fun was to be found
in the fraternities. “The Delta Tau
Delta Entertainment,” a headline
would read, or, “The Sigma Nus.”
“On Tuesday night of this week, the
Sigma Nu Hall was the scene of a
very merry gathering. The Sigs,
prompted by their desire to maintain
their reputation for hospitality, gave
in honor of their young lady-friends
a progressive jinks party; a person hav-
ing merely a hearing acquaintance
with the game would, in all prob-
ability, pronounce it rather namby-
pamby; but no such characteristics
were visible on this occasion,

“We regret the occurrence,” the
Ring-tum Phi piously continued, “but
feel it our duty to say, that while
the game was in progress, consider-
able ‘underhand’ work was deteced.
... Miss Nettie Houston demonstrat-
ed herself the most progressive young
lady present....

“While refreshments were being
served, Operatic music was rendered
by Sousa’s Grand Concert Band,
thanks to Mr. Edison. Flash light
photography was also indulged in;
some very ‘touching’ scenes were ob-

tained,”

A minor crisis arose in 1899 when
certain copies of Harper's Weekly,
Cosmopolitan and McClure’s maga-
zines were found to be missing: it
was announced that the librarian was
quite upset, and would not allow stu-
dents or faculty to read any more
magazines until the missing ones were
returned, because otherwise there
would be gaps when they were bound
into annual volumes.

A more major crisis arose the next
year, after a “venerable and venerated
lady” was knocked down by a speed-
ing bicyclist on one of the campus
walks. “The Faculty of the Uni-
versity have made a law,” this news-
paper chastised, “that the walks of
the campus shall not be used for
bicycling. ...

“It is believed that every intelligent
student and every reasonable person
will recognize the propriety of this
law, and observe it, in the future.”
The article, by the way, carried a
by-line: “Wheelman.”

The Ring-tum Phi had been born |

the very month Wililam Lyne Wilson
was inaugurated as President of the
University. There is no evidence that
the newspaper existed under his per-
sonal sufferance, but it did shy away
from making any comment whatever
on the University’s administration.

Postmaster-General for three).

On October 3, 1900, William L.
Wilson must have known he had
precious little time remaining to him
on this mortal sphere; he rolled all his
“anti-speeches” into one gigantic
harangue.

(In fairness, we suppose, it ought
to be added that despite Wilson's
apparent extreme sense of Morality
and Christianity and Right and
Wrong, and despite the fact that he
lasted just three years, he did endow
“from his modest means” a chair in
economics for W&L; and his death
brought us upwards of $100,000 from
his friends, including Grover Cleve-
land, who established a William L.
Wilson Fund which was in turn used
to establish the School of Commerce
and Administration.)

Thus endeth the century; thus
endeth the era. Our next install-

Law School's Legal Research Association

 

Students Rescue The

By LARRY HONIG

An attorney in nothern Virginia
recently acted as the seller's lawyer
in a land transaction. The real estate
agent, who normally takes his com-
mission out of the deposit placed by
the buyer, turned the entire deposit
over to the seller in this case.

After the sale was completed, the
seller refused to pay the agent his
commission, so the agent is suing the
seller's attorney for payment. Sound
complicated?

The lawyer thought so too, and he
turned to the Legal Research As-
sociation of the Law School for help.

“Pretty Good Bargain”
In what is described as a “a pretty

| sood bargain” for the attorney, two
| or three law students here at WAL
| will undertake an exhaustive five-week
| study of both aspects of the case to
try to find a legal precedent by which
| the lawyer himself will not be liable
| for the commission,

| The prestigious Legal Research As-
| sociation, under Chairman Michael
| Michaeles, is often called on by Vir-
| ginia attorneys to research complicated
points of law which may take the
| lawyer himself too much time or for
| which no common law precedent is
obvious,

A Little More Space, Perhaps?

By RIC BERARD

Dear Larry,

Following last Tuesday's poor
sport page, it seemed that something
should be done to remedy the de-
teriorating content
and format of our
section of the
paper. Thus, while
my articles in the
past have been re-
lated to athletics,
today’s column is
primarily concern-
ed with the pub-
lication in this
edition of its sports
news,

As you know,
Larry, it is my belief that athletics at
any school, but particularly at Wash-
ington and Lee, offers the greatest
source of school identity. Unfortun-
ately, this potential unifying factor
is being suppressed in two ways: the
first is the editorial opinion of this
paper and the excessive amount of
weekly advertisements; and then, the
lethargy that exists among members
of the Committee on Athletics and
the administration of Doremus, While
| wish that I could do something
about the latter, such is not possible
within the status-quo-monolith here.
Therefore, my primary concern is with
this edition and the sale of advertis-
ing.

While all the current difficulty may
simply be a lingering reaction to the
early fifties, the problem is no less
real. It is my hope that those of us
on the R-t P staff work to give athletics
at W&L, and W&L itself, new blood.
As things are now, that simply isn’t
possible.

For example, the editor of this
issue has frequently been overheard
saying, “Listen, I don’t care what
you do to the third page.” I believe
that, too often, this attitude is ap-
parent. With a dearth of writers, this
pages somehow pulled together each
week through the efforts of two or
three people. Unfortunately, what
little is accomplished is frequently
abbreviated because of the fantastic
amount of advertising on both pages
three and four, Frequently, each Ring-
tum Phi contains less than three pages
of pictures and type. And under
existing conditions, the sports page is
the first to be “trimmed.”

What this means is that, although
we do have an I-M columnist, my
weekly blurb and regular reporting,

_ By N.C. State

the columns are frequently emascu-
lated in order to print a part of each
and then the remaining segments can
only be found by searching between
the ads, Also, format, per se, is non-
existent. Frankly, I find such a situa-
tion untenable.

In addition, too many men go
out and kill themselves at W&L for
little if any recognition. At present,
unless you play on the basketball
team, no one could ever accuse you
of being a glory hound, But every
athlete deserves more news coverage
than what we can now provide. With
so little recognition, you virtually have
to be an isolate to get something out
of many “team” sports. Although |
admire the spirit that drives these
people on in face of adversity, such
a situation should not be allowed to
prevail. It’s unfair to the athletes
and the University. And so, | am ask-
ing the Publications Board, as well as
the editor of this paper, to do some-
thing about this as soon as possible,

With more space on the third
page and with a somewhat consistent
layout, the persons working on the
sports staff would be given greater
freedom and an opportunity for
creativity. For example, at this time,
there simply isn’t room for an inter-
view with the Director of Athletics-
elect, Lee McLaughlin. Or more cor-
rectly, such an article would preempt
any other sports news of the week.
Yet I believe such additions to the
page are not only “news” but of
interest—a combination we frequently
assume but rarely achieve.

Nothing can be done to rectify the
situation, however, until there is a
significant decrease in the inches of
advertising. If it is true, as the editors
say, that the sale of space offers
the two papers their only hope of
breaking even each year, then I sug-
gest something be done immediately
to increase the subsidization by the
Publications Board for the two issues
(a committee which | have been told
has several thousand dollars sitting
in the bank.) For even if this means
taxing the students a dollar or two
more each year—something which
might be achieved simply by “ad-
justing” the current budget—I believe
most of the student body would be
amenable to such an increase. But
something should be done, starting
this year, to insure an adequate pub-
lication of sports news.

This publication is in the position
to help the University to a healthier
campus attitude, and I don't believe |
the goal is beyond our reach. 1 think |
we should at least try.

For unless a change occures, we!
are going to lose what good people |
we currently have at Doremus, and |
we shall have stunted part of W&L’s
future before it is even given a chance.
1 would hate to think that we, the
students, are still so entrenched.

Well, Kid, let me know how your
exams turned out. And good luck
during your second semester in Spain.

Cagers Take On Hornets Here Tonight

The Generals, still suffering from
the long exam week lay-off, lost their
third contest of the season Friday
night to Old Dominion by a score of
78-70. The tide turned on Saturday
night however, as the Generals came
back to down Greensboro 103-68.
The weekend's action brought the
Generals’ record to 15-3.

 

Against Old Dominion the Generals
had several opportunities to win but
couldn’t get the offense to match the
fine defensive effort. There were 17
turnovers that cost the Generals a
total of 27 points and several missed
lay-ins. According to Coach Canfield
it was the turnovers that cost us this
victory but the team played admir-

In the past week the Gen-
erals’ three big men have
turned in their usual fine
performances and it was
quite difficult to choose one
from among them. How-
ever, because of his per-
formance against Old Do-
minion, this week’s selection
is Mike Neer. Against ODC
Mike earned 25 points and
got 14 rebounds and did a
good job on defense. Mike
has led the scoring in the
last three outings and is cur-
rently averaging better than
18 points per game.

man Joe Philips came in third. Co-
captain Noel Glinard and freshman
diving ace Mike Carrere went one-two

The Generals’ meet this Friday
against Loyola is one they hope to
win. Last year in the Loyola pool,
the Generals lost by a razor-thin
margin, and they hope to even the
score Friday.

 

Mal Wesselink, guard?

No, the Generals do not have a

new 6S” guard. It's only Mal Wesse

Wesselink, however, played guard in|

high school and handles the ball ex
tremely well for a big man. Uf by
chance the Generals acquire another
forward next year, Wesselink may be
considered at Kline's replacement.

Intramural Wrap-up
By GEORGE McFARLAND

The regular 1.M. basketball season
is all but ended. PDT, PKS and NFU
are sure to be in the finals. SAE and
SN are still fighting for their league
championship. SAE should win. As
soon as the make-up games are com-
pleted, the finals will begin. Once the
finals begin it wil be fun to see if
anyone can catch PDT on an off
night. Odds are that it cannot be
done.

Handball and bowling are progess-
ing with high participation. NFU
looks like the team to beat in the
alleys. Why did they eliminate the
faculty from I.M. participation? Think
ot the handball team they could have
fielded. Who could have beat them?

Just a few words now on my the
I.M. program is so popular and im-
portant. It is popular because it meets
several needs. One need is to be active
and to compete. Only in the 1M.
program can you compete actively and
completely, yet in a_ basically un-
threatening way.

Another need that 1.M. program
meets is the desire to belong. Strong
friendships develop from 1.M. com-
petition which provides opportunities
for students to work as a team rather
than in the more isolated competitive
ways of academic life. The LM. pro-
gram also brings people into con-
fact, sometimes violent, with each
other when no opportunity is avail-
able. Let's face it, for a small campus
there is a high degree of insulated
groups that never associate with one
another, The insulation is sometimes
violently destroyed in the 1M. sports
program.

Moral: get out there and partici-
pate. You may get a chance to re-

 

| lieve the tension, boredom or isola-

tion that causes evertyhing from
pimples to .9 cumulatives,

position was that the government
ought to enforce the laws to guarantee
the right to vote. If the present laws
had failed, the Republicans offered

law as unconstitutional,
Candidate Analysis

Goldwater continued with an
analysis of the Republican candidates
and their collective and respective
chances of victory. In response to
questions, Goldwater agreed that the
Republicans should nominate a man
who could win the election. He stated
| that Nixon could do so, despite the
present poll situation that shows Nix-
on trailing Johnson. He cited the polls
| in his campaign in 1964 that showed
| him behind Johnson 4-1 at the be-
| ginning of the race. (It probably would
| have been best for him to pay at-
tention to the polls.)
| Goldwater commented that any
Republican would have been de-
feated in 1964 (and this has an atmos-
| phere of speculation). The stigmata
| of such a loser as the presidential
| candidate may have hindered the
| election of other Republican candi-
| dates, and, indeed, the big Republican
winners were those who denied as-
sociation with Goldwater.

To all [this fraternity | political
aspirants

In anticipation of the forthcoming
ithis house, of which the writer once

ber of candidates for various and
sundry positions have requested my
oratorical services (apparently gained
through public services and retired
statesmanship) in support of their re-
spective candidacies,

Taking into consideration the facts
of 1) examintion confusion, 2) «
seeming lack of candidates at this
early stage of the campaign, 3) my
own indecision as to whom my in-
fluence (777) should be availed [sic],
I would request all who have or are
planning to solicit my services to
| please wait until Feb. 7 (to give my
Isic] two days to recompose my self
from F. D.) te talk to me.

Hopefully, by then, the various
candidates will be sufficiently an.
nounced so that I can muke some
completely arbitrary decision on whom
I will support.

Thanking you vey much, I am.

Campaigningly yours.

Chicago—A Mistake?

Novak said that the Democratic
Convention being in Chicago seems
on the surface to be a major mistake.
The city has poor communications
and internal problems. But the con-
vention is scheduled there as a polit-
ical favor to Mayor Daley. Johnson's
advisors, Novak stated, feel that Chi-
cago may be an advantage, however.
The peace marches, race riots, and
hippies, all protesting LBJ, will ac-
tually help his popularity in the
reaction that should set in.

Shriver vs. Dirksen

Novak said that Sargent Shriver
could win a Senate Seat in Hlinois
with a hard, vigorous campaign to
unseat Senator Dirksen. Novak feels
that Dirksen is “losing his touch”
and may lose his post as minority
leader in the Senate

Romney and Morality

Lubell said that Gov. George Rom-
ney suffers from “moral ambiguity,”
since he is in a good position because
of the fact that there is a war. The
existence of the war causes people
to turn to the more “moral” candi-
date to ease their consciences on the
morals of war.

As far as his personal preference
for a Republican nominee is con-
cerned, Lubell declined to comment
| since he takes polls—personally—and
would prefer only to discuss politics
| and its general relation to society.
