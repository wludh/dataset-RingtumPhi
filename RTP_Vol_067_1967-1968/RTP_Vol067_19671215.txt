To In vestigate
Rule Violations

Rumors that several fraternities

might face prosecution by the IF¢
Judicial Board for failure to obtain
permission for parties on the week

end of December 8 and 9 have been
denied by IFC president Ellis Zahra

Zahra said that an investigation by
IFC social chairman Ed Allen showed
that only one house had apparently
failed to comply with IFC rules re
quiring advance notice of parties. He

added, however, that it is not vet
certain that any violation has been
committed.

No action is likely to be taken

until after Christmas hilidays

Liquor-By-The-Drink
Supported By Levin
By FRANK ROSE

“After dark, history is not enough.”

Phis the attitude expressed
by Bernard Levin, a member of the
Virginia House of Delegates from
Norfolk, in a speech Tuesday night
before the Political Science and
Young Democrat clubs

Levin spoke for “a number of Vis
ginia legislators” when he said that
liquor-by-the-drink was necessary to
bring conventions and tourists into the
State. He added that “Virginia is a
step behind the times” in this respect.

The issue concerns the passage of
a bill by the General Assembly
authorizing local option on liquor-by
| the-drink, or “Shall localities have
| the right to vote on the right to have
whiskey served under the strict sup

was

 

}ervision of the existing Alcoholic
Beverage Control Board?”
If this bill were passed, Levin

stated, the rules on the sale of liquor
would be much the same as those
already applied to the sale of beer
and wine. This means that the peo
ple of each locality would be allow
ed to decide if liquor would be sold
by the drink in their areas

Levin cited numerous reports. in
cluding one prepared by Richmond
Professional Institute, stating that the
assumption that “prohibition is di
| rectly related to consumption is mis
| leading,” and that “prohibition is of
little or no significance” in the occur
rences of problems with alcohol

When asked about the chances of
the bill's passage by the 1968 Gen

eral Assembly, Levin said that the
problem with the bill is “just basic
politics,” with urban areas in favor

of the bill and rural areas opposed
to it. However, he pointed out that

Reason For Survival

It used to be called the Vigilance Committee, and its
black-robed members were empowered to paddle any fresh-
man for forgetting to wear his blue beanie and green tie to
every social gathering. When corporal punishment was abol-
ished it continued to levy fines on offenders against tradition;
and if fines proved unimpressive to the coatless, tieless student,
it could arrange though the EC for social probation. “Dictator-
ial little cabal!’’ said the columnists. “Legal buffoonery and
petty tyranny!” said the reformers. But the Assimilation Com-
mittee has fallen on hard times now, and when the Forensic
Union met Wednesday night in Payne 6 to debate whether
or not it should be abolished, there were only seventeen
students and a dog who cared enough to attend.

Still, the debate was interesting. It got some things out
into the open that everybody has been thinking for a long
time—that the Assimilation Committee ought to be abolished;
and also some things which people have perhaps not been
thinking about—that the Committee's work actually serves a
useful function.

Dick Penny and Rudd Smith, defending abolition of the
committee, probably had the sympathies of most W&L stu-
dents on their side. A vote of the spectators before the debate
started showed that 5 were in favor of ending the committee
while 3 favored keeping it on.

Their arguments centered chiefly around the commit-
tee’s ineffectiveness. It did not succeed in enforcing conven-
tional dress even when it had fining powers, they pointed
out, and is even less capable of doing so now. Its meetings
are infrequent (the last was a month ago). Its concrete activi-
ties are restricted to preparation of the Student Handbook,
arranging Orientation Week so as to allow freshmen the
maximum opportunity to join W&L organizations and activi-
ties, and visiting freshmen in the dorms once or twice a year
to answer questions and give advice on the subject of W&L
traditions. And even these activities, they argued, could be
performed more economically and effectively if they were
spread out among other groups. The enforcement of conven-
tional dress and wearing of name tags might be better left up
to the IFC (which supplies them anyway) and the dorm
counselors (who see the freshmen every day). The speaking
tradition should be the responsibility of all upperclassmen.
The Student Handbook could be handled by the IFC.

On the face of it, they were right: the concrete activities
of the present Assimilation Committee doubtless could be
conducted by other groups and organizations. Presumably,
this is what the spectators felt Wednesday night when, after
the debate, they voted 8-5 in favor of abolishing the Commit-
tee.

But one other point was made during the debate which
seemed to us highly significant. It was implicit in almost all
the discussion, and it was explicitly stated by Smith when he
said “We do not attack what the committee stands for (our
boldface), but its ability to do what it says it can.” The criti-
cisms which he and Penny made were concerned with whether
the committee could carry out its function, not whether it
should do so; in proposing the abolition of the Assimilation
Committee itself, they were suggesting only that its task be
assigned to others to carry out.

The function of the Assimilation Committee, as both
sides of the debate seemed to recognize, is greater than any
of its concrete activities. It is the end for which these activities
are means: the assimilation of freshmen into the experience
of W&L life and values. Part of that assimilation involves
opening as many doors to him as possible in campus organiza-
tions. That's why there is an Orientation Week. Part involves
familiarizing him with aspects of W&L. That's what the
Student Handbook is for. A very important part is presenta-
tion and encouragement of certain traditions—not with threats
of paddles or fines, but on the understanding that these tradi-
tions exist and that the freshman is expected of his own free
will to observe and appreciate them,

This is the overall aim of the Assimilation Committee.
Its individual tasks could conceivably be handled by other
groups. But we doubt very much whether the goal behind
the individual aims would survive without the unifying purpose
of a single committee. Wendall Winn and Bill McDavid,
when they argued for preserving the committee, pointed out
that the Assimilation Committee is made up of people who are
on it because they want to be and because they are sincerely
interested in the overall goal of assimilation, It is not fair
to expect the same interest or effectiveness from groups such
as the IFC, which has its own aims, or from individual students
and professors. It is also foolish to think that assimilation can
be attained by means of a paragraph in the catalogue and a
speech or two at Freshman Camp—as Winn and McDavid
also pointed out. The Assimilation Committee can provide
unifying purpose and direction to what otherwise would be
unrelated assimilation activities. It is on that ground that it
deserves to exist.

Rather than abolish the committee, we would do better to

give it greater scope.

More Completed
Than Apparent

The above “Proposed Ten Year
Plan” is a reproduction of the plan
presented to the student body in 1957.
It represents the needs presented by
the University Development Office in
a booklet entitled “The Vision of
Greatness.”

Much of the plan has not been
accomplished, however a good deal
more than meets the eye has been.

In the Development Program plan,
immediate needs were listed as fol-

Maintenance Center
Long-range needs were:
Athletic Facilities
Auditorium

Dormitory

Amphitheater, Lake and Arboretum
Perimeter Road and Parking Areas
U tilities

Alumni and Faculty Cab
Memorial Entrance Gates,

The cost of this program was ex-
pected to come to almost $6,000,000.
All of the Immediate Needs have been
met, although not necessarily as they
are listed above. A new science build-
ing for Physics and Biology was built,
and Howe Hall was remodeled to
include Chemistry and Geology, In
the Long-Run needs, a new dormitory
was built, some remoeling was com-
pleted, an alumni and faculty club
was built, and the memoral entrance
gates were established.

In addition, a supply store and
co-op was built. a new Student Union
is in the process of construction, and
Lee Chapel was restored.

The Development Office ceased to
exist when Dr. Fred Cole became
President. Dr. Cole feeling that sys-
tematic fund-raising between cam-
paigns was too costly. In deference to

Letters To The Editor...

 

Editorial Hearsay
Dear Sirs:

1 was appalled at the editorial which
appeared in the Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi this week. The editor evidently
gained his information from pure
hearsay, as he did not attend the
IFG-Faculty Coffee. 1 don't even
think that it was covered by a Ring-
tum Phi reporter since there was no
article about it in either edition, al-
though the Friday edition did have a
picture. At any rate, the editor was
obviously misinformed or uninformed

 

deferred rush problems. The editor
does recognize the fact of existence
of the Deferred Rush Committee, but
claims that the problems it is con-
cerned with are a “waste of time.”
What are the “actual” major problems
of a deferred rush committee if they
are not the problems of contact be-
fore rush begins, and the actual
structure of a system of rush?

The editor has misrepresented the
nature of the study the Deferred Rush
Committee is doing. It is not a “poll
of deans of various universities on
rush, deferred and immediate,” and

In the first place the entire purpose | it is not an attempt to verify the

of the Coffee was misunderstood. The
purpose was not to discuss whether
or not deferred rush should come to
WAL, or how to avoid it, This is
what the editor would have us think.
The IFC has accepted the fact that
deferred rush is coming, although
admittedly this was not accepted as
soon as it should have been. The
purpose of the IFC Coffee was for
a critique of the present system of
deferred pledging and for an ex-
change of ideas on systems of de-
ferred rush,

The meeting was definitely not “a
disaster of the first magnitude.” The
faculty members present took an in-
terested part in the discussion and
the Deferred Rush Committee re-
ceived some useful ideas. The meet-
ing was such a success that it lasted
twenty minutes longer than planned,
mostly because of faculty participa-
tion. Perhaps the light turn out of
faculty was due to a misundersiand-
ing of the true purpose of the meet-
ing. or due to the fact that the indi-
vidual invitations to faculty members
were not received until the day of
the Coffee.

Has Not Failed

The IFC obviosuly has not “failed
to bring about a thing” The De-
ferred Rush Committee is meeting
regularly and plans to bring a plan
for deferred rush before the IFC this
Spring. The IFC-Faculty Coffee was
not a meeting of “opposing factions,”
but a meeting for the resolution al

 

results of last year’s poll, Again the
editor is misinformed. The purpose
of the study is to see how other
universities have instituted a system
of deferred rush, and to see what
problems they came up against. In
this manner the Deferred Rush Com-
mitiee can better devise a solid system
of deferred rush and attempt to fore-
see and clear up many problems.

Would the editor have us create a
sysiem out of thin air, completely
oblivious of the experience which
other universities have had with de-
ferred rush? Does not the editor
realize that even a flatworm can profit
by experience? Evidently not. Dean
Atwood has guessed that the faculty
will accept whatever system the IFC
proposes as long as there is no rush
before second semester. The IFC and
the Deferred Rush Committee fully
realize this and are attempting to find
the best possible system.

Stupid, Short-Sighted Ignorance

Obviously the editor of the Tuesday
edition did not bother to acquaini
himself with the facts, His ignorance
resulted in a stupid, short-sighted, and
even malicious editorial. The Ring-
tum Phi is the major source of know!-
edge of fraternity events and other
student affairs for most of the faculty.
An editorial of this nature can be
very harmful to the IFC and fra-
lernity sysiem as a whole

In my opinion, the IFC has made
some mistakes in the past and has

This marked the second win of

in Lynchburg. Lynchburg’s © stall
offense in the game kept the score
down, as well as putting the clamps
on the Generals’ attack A full-court
press and double-figure scoring by
four W&L players—Bauer (10), Cart-
wright (12), Fauber (11), and Carrere

13:57

Against Asheville-Biltmore,
opened with a flurry and with
left in the first half, held a 13-7
lead. After this things tightened, and
the Blue could never seem to stretch
the lead. This was due primarily to
Asheville-Biltmore’s very effective full
court press, which the Generals were
never able to break.

Although W&L completely domi-
nated the boards and was constantly
in control of the ball, the Bulldogs
managed to keep close, forcing turn-
over after turnover, and sinking some
beautiful shots from the outside.

With 7:50 remaining, the Generals
lead had been cut to 27-25, but after
this they started to pull away again
and when the half ended, the Blue
found itself with a 47-40 lead.

Second Half Tightens
The Generals were not yet out of

the woods though, and when the
second half started, the Bulldogs
started to creep up again. The Gen-

erals found themselves unable to get
in close to the basket as they had
in the first half and started shooting
from the outside. At the same time
as the offense began to run

Hope was not to be lost, though.
With the Bulldog offense working the
ball for another score, John Carrere
stole the ball and ran down court
for a jump shot, The shot was good
and the Generals had the lead again
65-64, never again to be headed.

Sparked by another basket and the
leadership of Carrere, the offense
suddenly ignited. The Generals offense
scored fourteen consecutive points
and with 2:54 remaining the score

stood 77-64. The Bulldogs in attempt-
ing to catch-up, fouled Mal Wesselink
twice after shots, giving him two

three-point plays.
With four seconds left the Bull-

Among other projects planned for

Fraternities Victimized
By Thefts of Christmas

Decorations and Trees

The SAE’s and DU’s were both
struck last weekend by the disappear-
ance of the decorations for their
Saturday Christmas parties.

According to Bob Murray, Univer-
sity Proctor, all that is missing are
the Christmas trees, lights, and two
poinsetta plants, the last from the
SAE house. They were apparently
taken early Saturday morning, after
the decorations had been set up Fri-
day night.

Since the presents under both trees
were left alone, Murray said the work
was probably not that of local “hood-
lums,.” and that perhaps it could be
part of a pledge raid on the houses.

Letters To The Editor

(Continued from page 2)
not attacked all problems in the best
possible manner. However, in this
case the Deferred Rush Committee is
working a system and the IFC-
Faculty Coffee was a step in the right
direction for the solution of the prob-
lems of a deferred rush system as
applied to Washington and Lee. The
Interfraternity Council has many
problems to face on the behalf of
fraternities, and a misrepresentation
of the issues by a confused Ring-
tum Phi editor can only lead to
faculty misunderstanding and more
problems. An apology is certainly in
order.

Generals Defeat
Asheville-Biltmore

In Thursday Tilt

(Continued from page 3)
dogs scored the final basket, but no
one minded or even seemed to notice.
Washington and Lee had beaten a
tough Asheville-Biltmore club by a
comfortable 85-72.

Although the Generals’ teamwork
was greatly improved, the game was
filled with excellent individual per-
formances. Mike Neer was magnifi-
cent under the boards. He grabbed
every rebound in range and was con-
stantly free underneath for easy lay-
ups. Despite the fact that he rested a
large part of the game, Neer scored
26 points and was the high scorer
for the game.

Also not to be forgotten are the
performances of Jody Kline and Mal
Wessclink. Kline played an outstand-
ing defensive game, pulling off sev-
eral turnovers and rebounding well.
Wesselink was spectacular, in the final
minutes especially. He scored sixteen
points, but eight of these were made

at the close and were largely re-
sponsible for sealing the win
