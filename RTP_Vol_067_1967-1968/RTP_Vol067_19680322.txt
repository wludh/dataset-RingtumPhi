High School Seniors Interviewed

For R.

Twenty-one high school seniors
from eight states are visiting W&L
today and tomorrow as applicants
for Robert E. Lee and George F.
Baker Scholarships.

The high school seniors arrived
today from points in North Carolina,
Fennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Flor-
ida, West Virginia, Kentucky and
Virginia. Fifteen minute interviews
this morning with the Committee on
Financial Aid, made up of then mem-
bers of the faculty and administra-
tion, screened the number of appli-
cants for the Baker scholarships and
made final decisions on Lee Scholars.

Those who made it through the
screening will be required to have
another interview tomorrow morning.
Interviewing them this time will be
alumnus Edward H, Ould, president
of the First National Exchange Bank
of Virginia and member of the
Alumni Board of Trustees; Martin P.
Burks, also an alumnus and General
Counsel of Norfolk and Western

 

Railroad; and Dean of the College, |
William W. Pusey. The decision of |
this committee is final as to who will
ultimately receive Baker Scholarships.

Baker Scholarships To End
At W&L After Nine Years

Afier being awarded for nine
vears, the George F. Baker Scholar-
ships will be discontinued at Wash-
ington and Lee after this year.

lhe George F. Baker Trust of New
York City selected W&L in 1960 as
one of twelve colleges in the United
States to award Baker grants. Each
year the Baker Trust rotates its mon-
ey to different colleges and univer-
sities so as to include as many as
possible. The nine-year tenure for
the grants at Washington and Lee is

longer than many undergraduate
schools have been allowed to award
them

the Baker Scholarships at W&L

are awarded to entering applicants
who reside in the “general area from
which Washington and Lee students
are usually drawn,” which is to say,
predominently “Southern areas.” The
donors hope, but do not require,
that a substantial number of scholar-
ship holders will make their lifework
constructive business activity, “for
the awards were made possible by the
work of men who devoted their lives

 

io business careers, and the present

ject of study and concern.”

E. Lee, Baker Grants

Usually seven to nine awards of
each scholarship are made.

All applicants chosen to vie for the
scholarships have been picked from
the best applicants that have been
accepted to the university and have
shown sufficient need for financial
aid. Only one of the twenty has al-
ready sent in his acceptance. He was
an early-decision applicant.

While on campus, the prospective
scholars will talk with present Rob-
ert E. Lee and George F. Baker
scholars, who will show them around
the school and take them to classes.
The emphasis will be to make indi-
vidual students’ time available to the
the vistors.

At 1:15 today the applicants met
for a luncheon in the Commons, at
which time President Robert E. R.
Huntley greeted them and William
A. Noell, director of financial aid,
announced the results of the morning
interviews. The applicants will be
free this afternoon and tonight to
do whatever they want.

Both scholarships are four-year
awards in the amount of the individ-
ual’s financial need. They are both
contingent on the students’ retaining

a 3.0 grade-point ratio. By terms of
the Robert E. Lee Scholarship, Lee
scholars will come from the South-
ern States, and preference will be given
to those planning to go into public
service vocations, such as teaching
and law. There is no geographic
boundary requirement in the Baker
awards (see article on Baker Scholar-
ships), but preference will be given
those planning to go into a business
vocation.

Winston Named
WLUR Head

Charles E. Winston, currently an
instructor in the Department of Jour-
nalism and Communications and man-
ager of W&L’s WLUR-FM radio sta-
tion, is to become full-time manager
of the station next year.

In addition to his duties at WLUR,
Winston now teaches radio and tele-
vision courses in the School of Jour-
nalism and serves as executive direc-
tor of the Southern Interscholastic
Press Association and advisor to
Sigma Delta Chi National Journal-
ism Society. He has indicated that he
has not yet decided which of those po-
sitions he will keep next year.

By accepting this position, Winston
becomes the fourth full-time faculty
member in the Department of Jour-
nalism. He stated that his formal
appointment to the post on a full-time
basis apparently crystallizes the office.

Concerning his new role, Winston
remarked, “I will look forward to
devoting my full time and energies
to the radio station.” Possible changes
next year include “new programs and
new people.” Although he stressed the
fact that no definite plans have yet
been made, he said that “we want to
expand our audience and do unique
projects in the community.” He add-
ed, “I will have a lot of rethinking
to do over the summer,”

Winston observed that WLUR-FM

White is confident that Reagan has
enough to offer to surmount the
predominantly pro-Nixon sentiment
on the campus. White predicts Reagan
will win on the first ballot in both

When questioned on just how
Reagan will overcome Nixon's popu-
candidate's | jarity without announcing his candi-
dacy, White replied that although
Reagan hasn't announced his candi-
dacy, he hasn't announced he is not
a candidate. This allows his name to
be placed on the state primaries,
particularly the primaries in Cali

Oregon, White believes that he will

On the local scene, White is con

is growing and solidifing, Reagan

can overcome competition at the Mock

The idea for an underground paper

twelve students are actively involved
in working on the paper. Many of
the same students also said they were
active in the Students Against the
War movement.

Although the chief aim of “Notes
From Underground” is to stick to the
controversial matters around the
campus and be “a responsible critic
of the university,” twenty per cent of
the paper may be dedicated to the
Vietnam issue, but no more.

Curriculum Committee Criticizes

EC On Dismissing Of Chairman

(Editor's Note: In a unanimous
action Tuesday night, the Executive
Committee voted to replace the
chairman of the student Curriculum
Committee, alleging that he had
failed to submit a report to the EC
on the committee's activities despite
a number of requests that he do so.
On Wednesday night the remainder
of the Currimulum Committee met
and drew up the following letter.)

Dear Sir:

The Executive Committee's flair for
the dramatic has left us (the members
of the Curriculum Committee) at a
complete loss. In one sense we are
more than simply stage-struck at the
theatrical manner in which the E.C.
deposed chairman Lane Steinger, but
in a more immediate sense we are
angered at the way they went about
it. Forgetting for the moment their
justification for so acting, we would
like to make clear that there was no
effort made by any E.C. member to
contact the secretary of the Cur-
riculum Committee, Swede Henberg,
to inform him (or any other mem-
bers) of the steps taken to remove
Steinger. Obviously, such an attempt
would have served more purpose than
merely to give recognition to the com-
mittee itself; it seems logical that those
of us who are actively concerned
should merit more explanation than
a single paragraph in the newspaper,
which is all any of us have right
now.

Second (and here it seems the E.C,
has shown a regretable lack of good
taste) Steinger himself was not per-
sonally informed of the action. He
was left to discover his removal along
with anyone else who happened to
read last Tuesday's Ring-tum Phi.
Surely this is not a question of how
much justification the E.C. has in
their action. More precisely, it is an
oversight for which we can see ab-
solutely no defense.

All the above leads directly to the
question of exactly what our stance
as members ought to be. With no
access whatsoever to even an attempt-
ed explanation of the E.C.’s complete
ground of action, the remainder of the
Curriculum Committee is totally un-
certain as to what our reaction should
entail, Nor can we be sure whether
the E.C. acted in partial ignorance of
the facts. Since their action took
place without asking any members
of our committee to express an opin
ion, we can safely assert that the B.C

voied without information from at
least One Viewpoint: ours
Concerning the one criticum of

which we are aware (via the Ring-tum
Phi) charging Steinger with negligence
in submitting a report of the com
mittee’s progress, we can offer only
a partial answer. True, our progress
to date has not been substantial in a
but if must be re

membered that the Curriculum Com-
mittee did not exist before this year, |
If the E.C. expected numerous specific
programs the first year, they should
not have, Undoubtedly the E.C.’s main
complaint applies to the poll of the
political science classes, which took
place at the end of last semester. The
delay in that report is in part due
to reservations harbored by some
members of the committee as to the
feasibility of such a course. Steinger
is not entirely at fault.

Still, our main complaint rests on
the fact the E.C. has shown absolutely
no indications of asking our opinion.
Even though they may be somewhat
sensitive about their ultimate power
over the Curriculum Committee, it
seems to use that the E.C.’s response
proves, at best, arbitrary. Quite sud-
denly they are asking for applications
for a new chairman. Meeting Wednes-
day night, we agreed that—for the
time being—none of the current com-
mittee members would apply. What
we do ask is that the E.C. postpone
selection of a new chairman until
after we have had a chance to send
a representative to express our views
directly. That way, also, we can our-
selves be briefed as to the complete
facts on the situation.

Today there has been misunder-
standing on both sides is, of course,
an enormous understatement. It seems

 

to us that the E.C. would be wise to
agree to our moritorium in order to
clear up what (from our side at least)
seems a very hazy situation. Further-
more, certain other questions remain:
the E.C. tells us Steinger is no longer
chairman, but they say nothing about
his status on the committee itself. Is
he still a member? Finally, it seems
to us that a new chairman should
come from among the current mem-
bers, or at least be subject to our
recommendation. A person new to the
committee would meet the obvious
problem of being unfamiliar with the
directives decided on to date
In summation it seems the EC

should want to reexamine their action
in light of the criticisms we have rais
ed, We cannot emphasize too strongly
that if the E.C. ignores our plea for
establishing some sort of understand
ing, they will seriously hinder the
effectiveness of whatever course the
Curriculum Commitice eventually de
cides to follow.

Sincerely,
Swede Henberg

If Washington and Lee is to con-

College, schools of similar academic
and social standing of W&L, have
already instituted or are in the plan-
ning stages of an independent exam
schedule, which might prove satis-
factory to our curriculum. Mary
Baldwin is presently testing such a
system and, having used it once, has
found it be be quite a good system;
in their plan the student is given the
responsibility to determine her own
testing schedule.

Iwo weeks before the actual period
the student signs up to take exams at
a certain time during an eight day
period, at either 8:30 a.m. or 1:30
p.m. On the specified day to take
the exam, the student picks up her
test, which is placed in a_ sealed
envelope, turns in a card which her
teacher has previously given her to
receive her exam, and then takes the
exam in the Academic Building. Upon
completion of it, she returns both
the question sheet and her booklet to
a central desk and receives her ad-
missions card back, which meanwhile
has been validated by a teacher. The
students then instructed not to
discuss the test with anyone who has
not taken the test and are set free.

Hollins is presently planning a simi-

afe

lar system in which the student is
permitted to arrange her own exam
schedule: this would replace their

plan of take-outs and
pre-scheduled exams. Under the Hol-
lins’ method the student would be
more personally restricted, as it goes
to extremes in its concern over the
honor system. The student would pick
up her exam in a central office dur-
ing three conveniently chosen times
during each day of the period, would
then proceed to a designated room,
which would be proctored, and have |
the time of her admission to the room |
validated By the monitor, Upon the}
completion of the exam, the student |
faculty proctor would record the
time of the student's leaving, and the
student then immediately go
buck to the central office and hand in
her test

Under both systems such exams
ws fine arts and the spoken langu-
ages courses would be held at a
certain predetermined time because
of the obvious impracticality of
student arrangement of these tests,
Also, classes containing large oum-
hers of people would require sub-
mission of exams by a set date, so
ws to allow the teacher ample time
to grade them.

 

Such an independent examination
chedule would have a great effect
lessening of the presure as
ciated with exams. Mrs. Martha
Grafton, Dean of Mary Baldwin Col
lege, remarked concerning this, “The
nain thine U will do is end the
ensiom of lie ean period Practice

(Continued on page 4)

a world that is less perfect, but at
least real,

Our reputation is no more easily
soiled than that of Hollins, VPI, or
Mary Baldwin, or any other member
of the VASG. Yet, they were willing
to take the “risk” because, as seems
obvious, the benefits to be derived
were more significant and probable
than the worst possible embarrassment
they might “suffer” from collective
action taken by the VASG.

This particular line of prattle
against joining the VASG is more
than vaguely reminiscent of the con-
troversy over ratification of the
League of Nations Covenant in 1919,
when many Senators feared that
Article 10—which guaranteed the ter-
ritorial integrity of every member
state, by armed force if necessary—
would drag the United States into an
unwelcome foreign war. So the
United States did not join the League,
and thereby helped precipitate World
War IL.

If Washington and Lee does not
support the VASG now, in its mild-
mannered infancy, we will have only
ourselves to reproach for the absence
of a moderate and reasonable alter-
native to the NSA.

VASG No NSA

The EC has lost its whole sense

of perspective if it equates member-
ship in the VASG with membership
in NSA. First, Virginia students are
unlikely to assume the same posture |
as their counterparts at Berkley; for!

Night Drunk. Second, the purposes of
the VASG are substantially different
from those of NSA. Rather than try-

ing to create a bloc of “Student
Power” after the European’ and
South American models, such as is

the object of NSA, the VASG more
modestly seeks to improve the quali-
ty and scope of student government
in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
In brief, the mission of NSA is po-
litical and ideological, while that of
the VASG is administrative and edu-
cational.

Washington and Lee has an obli-
gation to assist in the building of the
VASG, which is still young and pli-
able. Our university has a long tra-
dition of providing leadership for the
Commonwealth, and the VASG is no
exception.

Are we fearful of competing with
other schools? Could our represen-
tatives to VASG conventions be less
capable than those from other
schools? Clearly, the answer is a
resounding, “No.”

Our students are at least equal to
the challenge of VASG, and should
be given an opportunity to prove it.
We can always resign from the or-
ganization if it proves necessary.

Letters To The Editor .. .

 

Down With Ring-tum Phi

Dear Sir:

This letier is in response to the
section of Tuesday's Ring-tum Phi |
entitled “Letter from the Editor.” |
From it I quote, “Signed letters are
invariably published in one of the
two Editions, unless their content is |
such that publication would bring us
legal grief—and in that case, we let
the writer know.”

A few weeks ago | wrote a signed |
letter to the Ring-tum Phi praising |
courage—the courage of Jim Lowe
for writing his controversial letter and
the courage of the Ring-tum Phi for |
publishing it. | added that | hoped |
the faculty would have the courage
to accept students’ criticism like the
men they are supposed to be.

It appears that I overestimated the
courage of the Ring-tum Phi and
the faculty. The letter has not been
published and I have been told nothing
by the Ring-tum Phi, although | did
hear informally that pressure was
being placed on the paper to let the
issue die. It also would seem that
the “Letter from the Editor” was
merely a mistake and my letter was
overlooked (although | did make in
quiries about it), | could call the
article a mistake or misunderstanding,
but I prefer to call it simply a blatant
untruth

Mr. Preston never contacted the

been happy to print his letter,

Thurmond Criticized

I am deeply distressed that the

to freedom in the country today are
1) of power (for this
read “states rights to insure that fed

rights to everyone”); 2) excessive
spending (for this read “it is fine to

a tiny fraction of that amount in

I submit that Thurmond’s “threa

the pronouncement and implementa

MARTINIZING:

THE MOST IN DRY CLEANING

 

Lexington Shopping Park

 

By ROY CARLTON

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse team
got off to a fast start this week, taking
on three fine teams in games on
four consecutive days. While the first
game, a 14-3 rout at the hands of
Adelphi could hardly be considered
an accurate appraisal of the team’s
potential, the Blue showed steady im-
provement during the game and again
the next day against Ohio State.

The week's scrimmages presented
numerous problems to the Generals.
Coach Szalsa was still experimenting
with different lines, and the players
had yet to become acclamated to one
another. Another complication lay in
the prescence of several important
freshmen bidding for starting assign-
ments. With the opening game against
Hofstra coming up next Saturday,
these are problems that have to be
worked out if the General’s are to
avoid another 15-2 disaster at the
hands of the Flying Dutchmen.

rhe first scrimmage, against
Adelphi (a rival school of Hofstra’s),
showed how much the Blue needed
work. The Long Islanders completely
dominated play in the first half and
walked off with a 10-1 lead.. As the
game wore on, however ,the Generals
began improving and started shifting

a, the play from their own goal area.

Generals Outhustle OSU

On Wednesday, the Blue took on
big Ohio State team. While the
Buckeyes were an extremely fast team
with good stickhandling, the Generals
kept things close. Although the final
score read 4-2, W&L might very well
have won if they had experimented
less. Freshman Bill Ingersoll played
goal very creditably in his first appear-
ance and at One point there were five
freshmen in the line-up: Ingersoll,
Bill Brumback, Whit Morrill, John
Knipp, and Frank Brooks, While most
of the action centered around the
WAL goal, there were numerous oc-
casions when the Generals put hard
pressure on the OSU goal, as evi-
denced by the fact that they were only
outshot 19-18. Hustling play account-
ed for much of the team’s success as
they came up with most of the ground

of the season, as evidenced by last
year’s debacle against Hofstra. Szlasa,
aided zy co-captains Terry Griffin
and Charlie Stewart, is determined to
avert that problem this year by a
heavy exhibition schedule, “If we
really wanted to win these games we
wouldn't have scheduled four in four
days.” The team ended the week
with two games against Yale. The
Blue finish their pre-season training
Monday against Dartmouth.
Yesterday against Yale, the Gen-
erals got off to a quick start, scor-
ing two goals in the first five minutes
of play. Attackman Chip Chew scored
both of them unassisted after circling
from behind the crease. As the Blue
continued to dominate play during
the quarter, it began to look as if
WAL was headed for its first success
of the season, but such was not the
case. Quickly regaining its composure,
the Eli squad played extremely sharp
lacrosse from the second period on.
Their passing became much more
deliberate and crisp and the Generals
were unable to mount a sustained
attack. Adding to WA&L’s difficulties
was an inability from the beginning
of the game to clear the ball from
there own end. The first Yale goal was
a direct result of this. After a save,
goalie Dave Johnson passed from
inside the crease to a midfielder at
midfield. The ball never reached the
middle though, as a Yale attackman
reached up and intercepted the pass.
There was no one between him and
Johnson and he had a straightway
shot. Johnson never had a chance.
Taking heart from the goal, the
Bulldogs scored again before the half.
A quick start in the third quarter
netted Yale three more goals. The
Generals did score once more in the
fourth period, and the spectators were
even able to sense it coming. For the
first time since the opening minutes
the Generals were able to set up
their offense. Terry Griffin, waited
for the attack to get into position
The whole field seemed absolutely
still. Suddenly Griffin dodged around
his man and fired a perfect pass to

  

 

Frank Brooks, streaking across the
goal mouth. Brooks fielded the pass
and fired it in all in one motion in|
one of the prettiest plays of the after- |
noon

The game ended like that with the
score 5-3 Yale, although there was a!

the recent legislative session, he serv-

Laws Committee.

Dr. Reid began his address with a
short history of the role of the
Negro voter in Virginia since the
days of Reconstruction. All types of
devices were used to cut down on
the Negro vote. All-white primaries,
literacy tests, and anti-Negro laws
helped to keep the Negro from real-|
izing his true importance in state
politics.

Concerning the upcoming  presi-|
dential elections, Dr. Reid said that
he believed that the majority of Vir-
ginia Negroes would vote for Presi-
dent Johnson if the opposing Re-
publican candidate was Richard Nix-
on. He felt that if Senator Robert
Kennedy ran against Gov, Nelson
Rockefeller, the Negro vote would be
pretty well divided.

Hunsicker of Richmond led the
way to another 1-2-3 Spider finish in
the half mile with a good early sea-
son time of 1:58.9. The visiting two-
milers were equally impressive, with
both winner Guest and runner-up

The winning time was 9:40.6, with

His big victory came in the high jump,
where the lanky Alexandria, Va.,

Indepnedent Exam Schedule Feasible?

(Continued from page 3) |

during this past semester’s trial run, |
Dean William W. Pusey felt that no
matter what kind of schedule is insti-
tuted, there will always be some sort
of pressure; he also believed that
under our present exam plan tension
has been eliminated to a great extent
because of the more liberal spacing
of exams. William J. Watt, Assistant
Dean of the College, also believed
that our present program offers the
same easing effect that an independent
system would possess.

Che problem of the overcrowding
of semester tests has been almost
totally solved by the present schedule
at W&L. The possibility of having
three and four exams on consecutive
days still, however, exists; such a situa-
tion could make or break a student
during this all-important time. By giv-
ing the student the opportunity to ar-
range his own schedule, a person
could adjust his schedule, such that
he woul dnot be forced to take tests
for which he may be unprepared or
just too “bagged” from the tedious
strain of studying.

denied such basic freedoms as the
right to vote? What does he say to
the South Carolina Negro who risks
his life in Viet Nam to insure the
South Vietnamese “right of self de-
termination,” but is denied equal op-
portunity and the right to vote in
his own country? Thurmond speaks
of “freedom” when white bigotry in
Orangeburg, S. C., results in three
deaths, simply because human beings
were denied access to public accom-
modations. “Threats to freedom,”

indeed!

Thurmond’s contention that “hard
core communists” led the assualt dur-
ing the peace march on the Pentagon
is highly debatable. Nevertheless, no
amount of innuendo can alter the fact
that increasingly large number of
patriotic Americans are against our
course of action in Viet Nam. To
debate our Viet Nam policy is laud-
able, but it is ludicrous to even sug-
gest that the commitment of over
$30 billion a year and half a million
men is “ignoring the communist men-
ace to the world.” Rather, what we
ignore in formulating our all too
sanguine solutions is the fact that no
problem so simple that it can be re-
duced to such an oversimplification
as “the monolithic communist men-
ace.” Our stated purpose in Viet
Nam is to “insure the right of self
determination of the Vietnamese peo-
ple.” If, in fact, we are prolonging
this war for any other reason, then
we would do well to ponder the
meaning of the word “imperialists”!
If we are using the Vietnamese people
to further our own ends, no matter
how noble we feel those ends are, then
the tearm “American imperialist” is
fitting. Thurmond speaks of “outside
agitators” in referring to South Car-
olina’s internal racial problems. He

described

The chance that a student would
take all of his exams at the beginning

/or the end of the period, of course,

is quite probable, but at Mary Baldwin
no serious difficulty arose because of
this. Dean Grafton pointed out that
she found a steady stream of papers
continued throughout the interval, and
that very few waited until the very
last day or took them in the first week
of the schedule. Professor Charles W.
Williams of the Math Department be-
lieved that W&L students would put
off the tests until the last day; he
compared this system with the pres-
ent scheduling process in which the
students make over three hundred
changes ‘per semester, mainly for the
purpose of gaining a schedule which
would better suit their personal sleep-
ing and social habits,

Parralleling this aspect is the char-
acteristic of the independent exams
being symmetrical with the student's
curriculum, By his arranging of tests
in an order more suitable to him, the
person can allocate more time to
study his hardest courses. Dean Watt
believed that the present system gave
sufficient flexibility of study time and
that the independent exams would not
alter it a great deal, Both Dean Watt
and Dean Pusey agreed that such
symmetry in the student's schedule
would be incongruent with that of the
professor. Teachers would have to be

examination period to clear up any
misprints or incomprehension of the
questions. This, saying the least, would
be of the greatest inconvenience to the
professor.

The last aspect of the independent
scheduling of exams is that it would
show that the faculty has a respect
for the maturity and the responsi-
bility of the student, As instituted
now at Mary Baldwin, a certain
faith is placed in the student's in-
tellectual abilities, but not in her
integrity.
