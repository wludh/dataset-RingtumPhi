LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, OCTOBER 3, 1967

The faculty, in its monthly meeting |
yesterday afternoon, postponed the |
deadline for deferred rush until the |
1969-70 session, The faculty had asked |
the IFC to submit a plan for rush to
be deferred, at least until after the |
first semester, commencing with the
1968-69 session.

 

For ‘Law Review’

night and decided to subsidize law
students’ subscriptions to the
Review.

Bill Schildt, president of the Student
Bar Association, presented the SBA
case. The SBA has in the past given}
the Law Review $400 which has|
covered the cost of the Law Review |
for the law students. Schildt stated

that in recent years the SBA has

 

undertaken a more ambitious program
of speakers, freshman law student
orientation, and mock trials.

Schildt said that the SBA’s $400
contribution would soon become quite
a burden for the SBA. He hoped
that this contribution from the EC
would counter-balance the inequities
which see the law students also pay-|
ing for the predominantly under-
graduate publications such as the
Ring-tum Phi, the Calyx and Ariel.

Leonard made the motion and
Crenshaw seconded it, that the SBA
should receive this year $400 to pay
for law school subscriptions to the
Law Review. This motion passed un-
animously.

In other action, President Richard
Nash noted that applications are being
accepted for the newly formed Cur-
riculum Committee, and he hoped
that any interested person would sub-
mit a written application

Ihe only other vote was the un
animous decision to allow the
SWMSFC to enter into any agree-
ment with any make of school rings

Leure Us Not Rest Now

During the summer we received a letter from an acquaint-
ance who saw the Troubadours’ superb-in-every-way production
last March of ‘‘Marat/Sade.” “Believe it or not,” the letter
read in part, “I still quake, remembering that production.”
So do we.

Each night (four) of its run, “Marat” played to standing-
room-only crowds (we are unable to laugh or even smile in
noting that, in this instance, “SRO crowd” and “156 people”
are synonymous). Each member of those four audiences must
have been as impressed as we by the excellent scenery—until
the truth did out. The walls of the theatre had simply been
stripped bare; a few appropriate scrawlings had been added
to those remaining from the building’s days as a cobblery and
pool hall—and behold!—an asylum.

We note with satisfaction, therefore, two encouraging de-
velopments over the summer:

 

® The mini-renovation of the existing structure, and

® More significantly, the statement that the University sin-
cerely hopes to appropriate, as soon as possible, up to $3,-
500,000 for an “adequate auditorium and ‘little theatre’,” as
part of Washington and Lee’s development program being
headed by Messrs. Frank Parsons and Farris Hotchkiss. (The
statement is contained as a footnote in the “Report of the Visit-
ing Committee,” the accreditors who spent three days here
last spring—incidentally, a highly provocative document that
each student would do well to read.)

To now, the Troubs—who are, after all, probably W&L’s
number-one tangible vehicle of good relations with towns-
people, not to mention their role as purveyors of entertain-
ment and dramatic edification to the Washington and Lee
community—have been imprisoned, artistically, in a degrading
and disgraceful mausoleum. From the point of audience con-
venience, the theatre has been made slightly less inadequate.
Even the Lyric, though, always had bathrooms; and it is humili-
ating that the only other things in the renovated theatre we
can brag about are the increase of the seating capacity all the
way to 182, and the installation of a heating system (God
bless the Hill) that works, and quietly at that. The stage, how-
ever, is no bigger (this is the stage that made “Enemy of the
People” almost ludicrous because the biggest “crowd” the
stage would accommodate in the mob scene consisted of fewer
people than there were speaking parts for) ; the lighting facili-
ties remain unimproved (we suspect that no electrical con-
tractor alive would touch the Troubs’ equipment with a ten-foot
insulated pole). There still is no “backstage” area, although
the new “‘sidestage” annex is something of an improvement;
the upstairs workshop-dressing room area is unspeakable, so
we won't.

All in all, we don’t think the Troub Theatre—physically—
is yet a credit to this University; the FROGS, Rockbridge
Players and every other local, non-W&L group will probably
continue to use the Waddell School in the conscious attempt
to avoid all possible professional contact with the Troubadour
Slum.

The mere initiation of serious administrative discussion
about something is nevertheless a major accomplishment at
Washington and Lee; we are pleased, then, that apparently
nobody is content with the state of the Troubadours’ facilities—

which even now only faith and hard, hard work make a

“theatre.”

Third Thoughts

We must note with thanks the faculty’s new and reason-
able attitude towards rush, as evidenced in yesterday's success-
ful reconsideration of last year’s two deferred rush ultimata.
In light of a statement made by a dean May | on the occasion
of the passage of the second faculty resolution that it “prob-
ably” was not contingent on the completion of the expanded
student union, it appears that perhaps second thoughts—or
ought we say third—were had by some on the entire matter.

Perhaps they realized that legislate though the faculty
might, a situation would inevitably be created over which
neither the faculty nor the Inter-Fraternity Council would have
the slightest controlling power.

Probably deferred rush will be forced into effect when the
student union is completed. One hopes that in “suggesting”
a program to be followed on that occasion by the fraternities
and the IFC, the faculty will maintain the attitude of moderate-
ness demonstrated yesterday—an attitude which for the first
time in two years of deferred rush debate bring the faculty
and student body a little closer to mutual non-unacceptability.

Gov. Ronald Reagan landed Fri-
day in Columbia, S.C., to the tumultu-
ous roar of a worshipful crowd. The
full day of activities was highlighted
that night with an amazing $100-a-
plate dinner attended by over 3,500.
This outpouring was unprecedented
in Southern political history, Twelve
Washington and Lee Young Republi-
cans made the 350-mile trip, and a
correspondent for the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi was seated between reporters
from the New York Times and a
color NBC camera.

The Washington and Lee delega-
tion left about 10 a.m. and arrived
in time for a 5 p.m. private reception
at a downtown hotel, Upon entering
the hotel, Miss South Carolina greeted
the W&L group and went with them
to the mobbed ballroom. Pandemon-
ium broke out as the senior senator
from South Carolina, Strom Thur-
mond, introduced the man of the hour
as “one of the world’s great figures.”
The next hour was one of pushing
and shoving to get in position to meet
the governor, which was successfully
accomplished by the determined Lex-
ington travelers.

Touchy Questions

At the afternoon press conference
the governor was confronted with a
series of touchy questions. Race is
always good copy in the South and
he let it be known that he believed
“laws alone cannot solve racial prob-
lems.” The governor says he thinks
the idea of the war on poverty is
“lofty,” yet he says federal money
alone cannot provide a beter living
to the American poor.

He urged having private industry
help out with the employment situa-
tion, but recognized that government

the overflow crowd in

has responsibility in this area. He
attacked the idea of splintering third
parties, earning the hatred of the
segregalionist Independent Party in
South Carolina. He went further and
reminded the audience there was no
such thing today as a hyphenated Re-
publican and they couldn't afford to
defeat themselves by division, Thus
he refused to classify himself on the
spectrum,

rhe reception was followed by the
_cold-cut dinner in the basement of

president may be, knows best.” This
was eaten up by the throng of newly
converted Republicans and was broad-
cast to the entire state on an hour
of prime television time. The impact
of this one-time Democrat could be
devastating to the state’s crumbling
Democratic establishment for this
point alone,

This partisan approach gave way to
his description of the dangers of big
government, The waste, intolerance,
and aggressiveness, he said, is not a
deliberate attempt to usurp power, but
is the product of good intentions, “It
is so easy for the dedicated public
servant to see how much could be
accomplished if only he had a little
more authority and, of course, a little
more money.”

He contrasted this rise of the
bureaurcracy to the development of
his administration in California. This
is the “Creative Society” and the
audience became more enthusiastic as
he listed its accomplishments.

Paxton Davis's novel, “The Seasons
of Heroes,” is a “whereafter.” The
third narrator of the novel explains
that his grandfather would use the
word “whereafter” in order to launch
himself from the climax of a tale
out into “an unforeseeable and al-
together astonishing sequel,” inevitably
to the amazement and great delight
of his grandchildren, The purpose of
a “whereafter” is “to stretch a tale
out to its absolute uttermost.”

“The Season of Heroes” tells the

boneys, three of whom speak for
themselves in their roles as narrators
of the three more-or-less self-contain-
ed sections of the novel. The first
section deals with Robert Gibboney,
who in 1864 takes part in a Con-
federate raid into Pennsylvania, In
the second section Robert's father,
Matthew, tells the story of his life
from his early childhood through his
long career in the U.S. Army, con-
cluding with his being offered a com-

mission in the Army of the Confed-
eracy. The third section concerns the
‘involvement of Robert's son William
in a race riot in 1912,

Opportunity for Heroism

Each of the narrators is faced with
an opportunity for heroism, Robert as
he looks down the barrel of his re-
volver into the face of a Yankee
soldier, Matthew as he considers the
commission of general in the Confed-
erate army offered him, and William
as he faces an enraged lynch mob to
protect a Negro he does not like. The
choices the three must make are simi-
lar, and the unity of the novel lies
in this fact. Paxton Davis's style car-
ries the reader along to these three
climaxes very effectively.

This is not a book to try to go to
sleep over. But, more importantly,
Professor Davis does not allow him-
self and his reader the benefit of an
easy solution in any of the situations,
And, since the novel is a “whereafter,”
he does not allow the reader to stop
with any one of the climaxes.

Enjoyable to Read

The novel is well written, then, It
is enjoyable to read. It is well con-
structed: each of
suggests something about the meaning
of the other two sections. But what
is most successful about this historical
novel is its relevance today. Young

Generals Open Home Season

Pfeiffer Felled By Generals
As Craig, Yow Score Goals

Washington and Lee's varsity soccet
team started the season off on the
right foot by blanking Pfeiffer College
last Friday, in a game played on the
loser’s field in North Carolina. The
Generals were scheduled to play two
games in the Tar Heel State, but
Thursday’s encounter with Belmont
Abbey was rained out.

Craig scored two goals against Pfeiffer,
both on passes from Left Inside Scott
Fechnay, The other tally was regist-
ered by Left Outside John Yow on

upcoming games. One of the team’s
greatest needs is for individuals who
are capable of playing more than one
position, This is made necessary by
a lack of depth.

Lyles singled out several players for
| special praise. Goalie Thom Mitchell
played an excellent game, displaying
great moves, Fechney did a fine job
while playing the whole game. Craig

An outstanding team effort made

the win possible with particular credit
going to senior kicking specialist, Cary

following the second period touch-
down; and the defensive linebacker
John Wolf, who was all over the field

down passes.

Wolf came up with the big play

Steve Saunders,
Republican Mock Convention, ap-
peared the EC to report on
the progress of the preparations. He
estimated that about $2,000 had been
raised in advertising and $1,000 had
been donated to the convention. He
ilso stated that the convention would
soon be opening its permanent head
quarters in the Dutch Inn,

Steve Sandler reported to the EC
that his investigation into the possi-
bility of allowing alcoholic beverages
at home football games had been
heavily discouraged. Wick Vellines
reported that he and Steve Saunders,
editor of the Southern Collegian, are
looking into the possibility of the
return of the Collegian as a school
sponsored publication

In the closing minutes of the meet-
ing, Vice-president Gil Faulk reminded
the committeemen of Acting Presi-
dent Pusey’s request that the students
should suggest possible candidates for
the Presidency of Washington and Lee.
President Nash then appointed a com-
mittee of Faulk, Halford, Sandler,
ind Hendricks to specifically consider
the problem and to report to the full
EC on their conclusions, i

Steve Sandler raised ques: |
tions in regard to University policy
which had been bothering him. First |
was the limitation on the amount of

that accounts left unattended for either
four months or one semester will be
subject to Committee action. A viola-
tion of this type will be treated in the
same manner as a cold-check viola-
tion.

The fining system for cold checks,
as in the past, begins at one dollar.
The second offense results in fines
up to five dollars; and the third cold
check violation carries a maximum
$25 fine, as well as a possible appear-
ance before the EC for further action,
The duration of time for accumula-
tion of offenses is again two years,

Tigher Controls
Much tighter controls will be ex-
ercised this year in dealing with viola-
tors. A letter will be sent to the
student the first week informing him

that he must apepar before the Com-
mittee. In the past, many students
have dismissed hearings before the

Committee as unnecessary, if the mer-
chant had himself fined the student,

If the student fails to appear, he
will be contacted personally by a
member of the Committee. The EC
will deal with those violators who do
not appear after the second notice.

The Cold Check Committee is send-
ing letters to Lexington merchants ex-
plaining both its purpose and the pro-
ceedure for reporting a student who
has cashed a cold check.

tee representative to the stores which

team easily played as good a game
as Randolph-Macon’s, with John Wolf
of W&L being the best defensive
player on the field that afternoon,

Combine this with the kicking of
specialist Cary Green (who accounted
for seven of our 13 points), a good
passing game and we see the Gen
erals beginning to live up to the pre-
season predictions, Indeed, perhaps
the home ficld advantage wasn’t the
decisive factor after all. And maybe
we are seeing the emergence of the
talent, desire and team play that
have been so lacking for three long

Well, anyway, next week we take
on our first CAC opponent, Centre,

back, Joe Lamonica, returning this

will have a potent offense to couple

significant realm of the shape of one’s
life.

Ihe last few pages of the first sec-
tion were published as a separte short
story in the November 1962 issue of
Playboy. The point of that story was

clearly stated: “evil is not inflicted

on man; it is what man did himself.”
The moral still holds true, but Pro-

| fessor Davis has reworked his story,

adding and deleting, so that now it
is a more subtle, much more effective
piece of writing. (For one thing, the

| general’s name is changed from Me-
| Causland

to McNaught; the closest
the narrator comes to a moral in the
novel is “We find in war the self we
dare not face in peace.”) The mean-
ing of the novel is much more com-
plex than that of the story, but also
more significant and presented with a
great deal more art.

Aricl is now soliciting manuscripts
