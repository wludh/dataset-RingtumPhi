Hallowe’en (Tuesday, October 31, 1967)

On Final Examinations

The faculty’s Committee on Courses and Degrees, which
is studying various possible revisions in the University’s sched-
ule of final examinations, is expected to make a report to the
faculty assembled Monday. Judging from the committee’s
record in the recent past—-notably, its approval of a subcom-
mittee’s recommendation that W&L adopt a form of the
Oxford plan of independent study; its initiative in establishing
a pass-fail program— it appears that there is more than a fair
chance for a final-exam revision of some significance to be
presented for approval. Certainly nothing less is the hope of
every student who has even looked at the existing inflexible
one-on-top-of-another schedule and seen potential (at best)
disaster. And certainly this is a reasonable hope in a school
where this semester the exam schedule is such that a student
taking Math 1, English 151 and Inorganic Chemistry would
have exams in those courses jammed into one 48-hour period.

One revision plan, submitted Oct. 10 to the committee
by the student body Executive Committee, asks that students
be allowed to sign up to take their exams whenever the exams
are given during the exam period. That is, if a particular course
is given at, say, B and G hours, students would be allowed to
take the final with the B-hour section or with the G-hour,
regardless of semester-long class “assignment.” This would
solve a few problems for a few people, and everybody would
appreciate it because it lessens everybody’s chances of meet-
ing a Waterloo—so long as they take courses offered at two
different hours, but not at three hours because when there are
three or more sections of a course, it’s placed into an afternoon
block exam time period, and there is no provision for changing
these in the EC proposal. Our hypothetical student with math,
sophomore English and Inorganic would still have three exams
out of four consecutive exam periods.

In petitioning for this change, the EC implied this request
was only a preliminary, a stopgap proposal until provision
could be made to adopt a “completely” flexible exam schedule,
perimetered only by a “first day for taking exams” and a “‘last
day” —in between which students would have five “take-home”
exams or, if not that, then at least “take at your and the
professor’s mutual convenience” exams. Washington and Lee
is small and students accordingly are given the optimum amount
of attention by a set of excellent teachers; this is undeniable
and is more than anything else the reason we and probably
1,400 other students are here.

We don’t want to appear to be calling the plays before the
faculty even enters the field; we don’t feel any need at all to
express alarm at what we're afraid the faculty will do; but we
do want to indicate once again, if we may, the degree of im-
portance every student attaches to an exam schedule that
doesn’t destroy all or even very much of what he has worked
a semester to realize. Exams are not just the frosting on a
semester’s cake; they are the substance of it. A student here
has only eight exam periods—these largely determine the re-
sults on paper (and those are the results everybody cares most
about) of his four years and $15,000 expenditure; they indi-
cate the professors’ success in putting across what ought to be
put across (“Washington and Lee is primarily a teaching insti-
tuition” —the catalogue). In spite of the standard “It is not
the University’s obligation to provide cramming time for stu-
dents who have been lax for a semester,” it does seem that
providing “review time,” as one might more genteely call it,
is a good idea for everybody.

Curriculum Committees Underway

 

French Classic
Returns To Lyric
For New Praise

To the delight of all who have a
modicum of artistic appreciation and
aesthetic sensitivity in their bones, Ed
Side has made Lexington a happier
place for escapism this week by re-
viving the French “Mary Poppins,”
the Grand Prix Winner at the XVII-
em Cannes Festival, “Les Parapluies
de Cherbourg.

Even those who can’t tolerate opera
for a moment find themselves caught
up in the typical French triangle,
Guy, Genevieve and Roland Cassard.
The music is superb, of course:
Michel Legrad is France’s Leonard
Bernstein, and “The Umbrellas of
Cherbourg” is Legrand’s “West Side
Story.” Even the American Academy,
which is known for taking care of its
own, nominated “Parapluies’”  re-
curring theme for an Academy Award.

Story Not New

The story itself is not new; there
are few older. Girl loves boy (Cath-
erine Deneuve is the girl—she’s the
one who excelled so in “Repulsion’);
he has to leave her (the French
draft, you know); after their last
night together she ends up in a family
way; he, once in the army, seems
(but isn’t) disinterested; she is pres-
sured by Mama into lovelessly marry-
ing a suitor who'll accept her in her
condition; father of her child comes
home; he marries on the rebound,
for want of something better to do.
The final scene, where the original
lovers meet through coincidence, is
one that rates with the love scene in
“Phaedra,” although by a very dif-
ferent standard.

The real strength of the movie lies
in its acting. Every character, even
those who appear for only a moment
in the background, is perfectly cast.
The two older women in the movie—
the girl's mother an dthe girl's lover's
aunt—have major roles that could
easily have intruded into the movie:
it is fortunate and surprising that they
don’t. The one “corny” scene, wherein
the girl and her husband (remember,
this isn’t her lover) are having dinner
in her mother’s home and suddenly
a Golden Crown appears and he
conducts a little coronation ceremony

with it, has possibilities for really
destroying a movie—but doesn't,
through some rather skillful role-

interpretation by actors who knew just
how far out the scene was.
Beautiful Photography
The photography is beautiful. The
French feel for color comes through
to save some sets which aren't exactly
elaborate. Camera work is simple and
effective. The whole thing comes
across—and what more can be said?
And finally, no mention of movies
this week could be complete without
comparing the offering of our two
friendly-rival theatre entrepreneurs.
In this regard, the entire student body
at Washington and Lee is deeply in-
debted to Ed Side for bringing this
particular movie at this particular time
to help counterbalance the abhorrable,
repelling “Luv” at the State.

Two girls watch the Washington and Lee Glee Club rehearse for its concert in front of the Iranian Exhibit.

Glee Club Entertains Audiences
In Washington And At Expo ’67

By MIKE ALLDERDICE

Strategically positioned at the
border between Iran and Switzerland,
the Washington and Lee Glee Club
did a fine job of entertaining its inter-
national audience. The W&L Glee
Club had the honor of being in-
vited to sing at Expo 67 on October
17, and the visitors of Expo had the
pleasure of listening to them.

The Glee Club, under the direction
of Professor Robert Stewart, had been
practicing diligently in preparation for
this trip since early September. The
rehearsals were more concentrated
and rigorous than ever before, but
the final result was well worth the
effort. By the date of departure, the
club was in top voice and keyed for
the coming performances.

Started October Ist

The trip itself started on Sunday
morning, October 15. The brass choir
and most of the freshmen in the Glee
Club boarded their bus for Wash-
ington early that morning. The rest
of the Glee Club left at eleven for the
Roanoke airport and were on a Pied-
mont flight by twelve.

 

Arriving at Washington, the group |
of students was greeted by Pete's trans- |
portation service in the form of a!
Rockbridge county school bus. The!
club was then chauffered to the Na-

tional Cathedral.

At the Cathedral, the Brass Choir
performed four pieces. They were fol
lowed by the Glee Club which sang
traditional religious works and three
spirituals as a prelude to the after-
noon service.

By five o'clock the Glee Club was
back on its flight to Monireal. After
stopping in Utica, New York, to re-
fuel, the club arrived at Montreal by
ten p.m. After clearing customs the}
club was driven to their motel, la
Parisienne. The first night was used
for purely un-official activities

Informal Concerts

On Monday the WAL Glee Club
gave two concerts at one of the most
modern and biggest shopping centers
in Montreal, the Alexis Nihon Plaza
It was strictly an informal concert;
the audience stood around the Club
or lounged on the surrounding bench
es. Although the situation was casual,
the concert was still professional
Everyone gave his maximum effort

At the time of the Club's tour,
all of Montreal was stymied by a

this, the mayor of the city had urged

‘Mais C’est Tout’

We feel obliged to quell, on occa-
sion, rumors that we feel have no
place in the University community,
i.¢., rumors not started by this news-
paper. Accordingly, the Ring-tum Phi
is pleased to announce that none of
the University’s professors are going
to Washington this week to stand as
defendants in cases arising from the
recent anti-War protests; one or two
of them are going to a political-science
convention in New Orleans, mais c'est
tout.

 

one was driven to Expo at nine that
morning, and given free passes to the
fair. The concerts were given at eleven
and five in a bandshell located in
the midst of quite a few exotic pavil-
lins. Appropriately enough, they hap-
pened also to be next door to the
Brewer's Pavillion, which was in-
spected by a few connoisseurs among
the Glee Club.
Miserable Weather

Outside the bandshell, the weath®
had been getting worse all day. It
finally leveled off to a fine drizzle that

lasted until night. Because of the
weather, the crowds became dis-
couraged, making the lines to the

better pavillions shorter. Most of the
students took advantage of this by
taking in as many pavilions as pos-
sible.

The concerts were excellent and
the audiences responsive, which all
added to the pleasure of Professor
Stewart, who proclaimed the trip as
“the Club’s best.”

Generals Nab Title
As Eagles Succumb

Washington and Lee captured the
Virginia Small College League foot-
ball championship Saturday of Open-
ings with an easy 16-0 victory over
Bridgewater College. This gives the
Generals a 4-0-0 record aganist the
Eagles.

Cary Green remained the team’s
top scorer as he accounted for 9 of
the points scored. Scoring for the
Generals started in the first quarter
with Green's 32 yard field goal after
the offensive unit failed to move the
ball,

The only touchdown of the day
in the second quarter when

quaterback Andy Bloom capped a 10-
play drive that began on the W&L
34 with a five-yard pass to halfback
Bucky Cunningham.

To the dismay of the Bridgewater
homecoming crowd, the Eagles only
scoring threat came early in the
fourth quarter when quarterback Alan
Tibbs’ running and passing advanced
Bridgewater from its own 5 yard line
to the W&L 15.

The Generals’ VSCL record now
stands at 3-0 and its over all record

at 4-2. Bridgewater stands at 2-4 over

all and 0-3 in the league.

W&L’s First

Washington and Lee’s first J.V.
football team opened its season last
week with a surprising 24-0 win over
Augusta Military Academy. Notable
performances included the fine de-
fensive effort which held Augusta
scoreless and Ken Carter, who was
substituted for injured fullback Doug
Gosman.

This year, the athletic department
has discarded the customary freshman
team in football and organized a
junior varsity team that has four
sophomores on its roster. While still
in an experimental stage, it is felt

that the new set-up will be more
beneficial to future varsity teams and
will allow all the players, both fresh-
men and upperclassmen, to get more
playing time.

Great Expectations

Mr. Richard Szlasa, the J.V. coach,
believes his team’s greatest strength
lies in its offensive backfield. Passing
should be the order of the day with
quarterbacks Trip Smith and Buzzy
Sadloch throwing to Randy Reed.
Reed is a versatile player who was
converted from quarterback positions.
From time to time he may still see
duty as a quarterback. The running
attack shouldn't be lacking either with
Doug Gossman at fullback and Bruce
Green at wingback. Both are good
strong runners and excellent pass
blockers. The team’s supporters can
expect to see a wide open offense with
plenty of roll-outs.

The main problem may occur in
the defense. Junior varsity teams tradi-
tionally have a problem with depth
and W&L is no exception. The de-
fense may very well be strained al-
though it is bolstered by several out-
standing players. Peyton Vickers, Dee
Copenhaven, Frank Evans, and Ken
Carter should turn in fine perform-
ances. Copenhaver will see double
duty as an offensive guard and Carter
will probably be substituted freely in
the offensive backfield.

Roanoke Blanks
Soccer Team

By LAURENCE M. HILLIARD

Roanoke College came to Lexing-
ton on Friday, boasting that it pos-
sessed the top soccer team in Virginia,
and the Generals were unable to refute
this claim, bowing 3-0. The loss left
the Generals with a 4-3 mark. Roa-
noke is 7-1.

Before the game, Coach Joe Lyles
warned his team about Roanoke line-
man Scott Anderson and Jeff Archer,
but despite close defensing, Anderson
managed to slip through the Blue de-
fense for two goals, with Archer tally-

 

 

ing the other.

The Roanoke detense, seemingly |
with the belief that if General Left |
Inside Scott Fechnay could be held
scoreless, the whole team could be
stopped, had double coverage on|
Fechnay whenever he received the
ball. Coach Lyles continually altered
the atack, but with little success

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Goals of Curriculum Committee

(Continued from page 2)

does not want such a report to be
vindictive or of such hasty construc-
tion as to lose any meaning.

Some Problems

It is as yet uncertain whether this
student publication would take the
form of an evaluation, an expanded
course description or both, The dis-
advantages of any attempt to judge
or rate are obvious, but a complete
disregard in this respect might result
in a rather innocuous document.

Steinger plans to ask the EC to
increase membership on the Student
Curriculum Committee to 10 or 11,
so that standing committees may be
appointed to study each idea that
may be of interest.

Faculty Committee

Planning along lines similar to the
Student Curriculum Committee is the
newly-formed Faculty Curriculum
Committee, appointed this fall by
Acting President Pusey. This com-
mittee elected Dr. Henry S. Roberts,
head of the biology department, as
its chairman,

Care apparently was taken by Dr.
Pusey to have the faculty committee
consist of members from various de-
partments within the University. Al-
though also still in a formative stage,
there seem to exist some specific ideas
for possible study.

Open Door Policy

Dr, Roberts made it clear that the
Faculty Curriculum Committee is by
no means a secret body. The sug-
gestion has been made that the two
committees combine or have joint
meetings, but this was mutually de-
cided against because of its unwieldy
size and certain inhibitions on both
sides.

Both Dr. Roberts and Steinger are
satisfied with the dual-committee ar-
rangement, and point out that com-
munications will begin on a regular
basis as soon as specific suggestions
are made. As Dr. Roberts said con-
cerning the exchange of ideas, “If the
students don't advance them, we're
going to solicit them.

Early Ideas

The Faculty Curriculum Committee
will most likely also examine the
Honors Program, looking at its weak-
nesses and strong points. And it may
be that the faculty committee will
wish to consider the charge that the
University is too departmentally struc-
tured; perhaps greater interdepart-

 

mental unity will result.

Department heads will likely be
consulted frequently in a serious look
at overall—not specific—distribution
requirements. A broad overlook ap-
proach will be taken by the com-
mittee, according to Dr. Roberts, with
considerations of the philosophy be-
hind the University curriculum.

A Shade of Difference

There is a basic and substantial
difference between the two commit-
tees. Obviously, the Student Cur-
riculum Committee will be prone to
concern itself more with short-range
goals of immediate benefit to Wash-
ington and Lee, Its turnover will be
yearly.

The Faculty Curriculum Commit-
tee will assume a longer-range, broad-
er and perhaps more thorough ap-
proach. Its interdepartmental mem-
bership, after having spent possibly
years considering major curriculum
chances, will certainly have the respect
necessary for a thoughtful faculty
vote on its recommendations.

Daylight Saving
Curtails Sleep

(Continued from page 2)

because nobody wants to buy coal at
all, it would undoubtedly organize a
huge lobby in Washington to repeal
DST altogether.

Some people, in fact, posit that DST
is a decided evil, that it alone is re-
sponsible for the riots in the cities
and everything else, because people
have more daylight hours to see the
squalor they live in.

So what we propose to do is to
make Daylight Saving Time a weekly
affair, Every Saturday night, every-
body should advance their clocks an
hour (if this becomes widely enough
accepted, the clockmakers of the
world could invent a new seven-day
clock that takes care of this auto-
matically); since they could sleep late
Sunday (they do anyhow), the hour
really wouldn't be missed.

Then, in the middle of the week,
say about Wednesday or Thursday,
everybody should move his clock back
an hour, and recover the hour when
he needs it most. Who would be-
grudge an extra hour abed toward the
end of the week, especially in a so-
ciety such as this where it’s been
statistically proven that 89 per cent
of the people orient their entire lives
to sleep?

Incidental Benefits

And think of the incidental bene-
fits. People in Appalachia who have
nothing to do from one season to the
next would regain their will to live,
looking forward to each Saturday's
and Wednesday's time changes. It
would be only a matter of time before
clock-changing bees became the ma-
jor social outlet in the Ozarks.

In fact, a random sample poll of
five representative types in Lexing-
ton showed that the only objection
to the Ring-tum Phi's DST plan
(which we call Darkness-Saving-Time)
is that somebody would have to think
up a new adage to replace the old
favorite, “Spring ahead, Fall behind.”

Members of the Student Service
Society are reminded of the interviews

EC Discusses
Chitwood Fund

(Continued from page 1)
votes enpowered the Library Commit-
tee to spend the $280 of the Chit-
wood Memorial Fund on “best-sellers”
and delegated the authority to the
Library Committee to purchase the
books at their discretion.

The EC reached a consensus that
there was no pressing need to grant
the Rugby Club any money, and that
it would wait to see what the Rugby
Club’s need would be later in the
year.

Freshman representative Joe Tomp-
kins urged that there be greater fresh-
man representation on the EC’s stand-
ing committees. He moved that there
be two freshmen appointed to the
Student Library Committee. This mo-
tion was defeated by a 5-4 vote in
which president Richard Nash had
to cast a tie breaking vote. Voting
for the resolution was Joe Tompkins,
vice-president Gil Faulk, senior repre-
sentative Joe Matthews, and junior
representative Herb Crenshaw. Vot-
ing against the motion were Richard
Nash, secretary Jody Kline, junior
representative Lee Halford, and sopho-
more representatives Danny Leonard
and Steve Sandler. Butch West ab-
stained, Pete Hendricks was absent,
and Wick Vellines had left earlier.

Committee Selection

Lee Halford then moved that one
freshman be selected for both the
Cold Check Committee and the Li-
brary Committee. This passed 8-1 with
Joe Tompkins voting against the mo-
tion.

 

IFC Meeting

(Continued from page 1)
from the rule, since there are only
two weeks left before the mid-
semester—no pledge parties or other
activities are allowed.

Dean Atwood also expressed con-
cern over the increasing number of
small children and high-school boys
at fraternity parties. He said that some
of the children may be attracted by
the opportunity for theft as well as
the music. And high school students
were definitely out of place, accord-
ing to Dean Atwood.
