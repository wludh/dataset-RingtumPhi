The Student Affairs Commit-
tee voted Monday to uphold the
suspension of Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity.

SAC voted on recommenda-
tions made by President John D.
Wilson after his consideration of
FIJI’s appeals. The decision was
decided by a 10 to 1 vote, with
one member absent. In his letter
to SAC, Wilson stated:

“I am convinced that SAC’s
fixed suspension of Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity through the 1994-
1995 academic year is war-
ranted.”

SAC Monday confirmed four
resolutions in response to FIJI’s
appeal.

° FIJI is suspended through
the 1994-95 school year and will
not be permitted to participate in
the fall 1994 Interfratemity Coun-
cil Rush.

' The House Corporation will
be invited to submit an action
plan to SAC by May 1, 1994
concerning the future of FIJI.

° Contingent upon a construc-
tive and workable House Corpo-
ration action plan, SAC will sup-
port the members of this year’s
FIJI pledge class living in the
fraternity house beginning in the
fall term 1994.

° SAC will review and assess
the progress of FIJI in January
1995.

Dean of Students and SAC
Chair David Howison said SAC
deliberated the case over the
weekend before making the deci-
sion Monday afternoon.

“A clear consensus emerged,"
Howison said. “Each member
came by individually and re-

viewed other documents. Then
each member individually voted.”

Recommendations to SAC
were based on the original IFC
indeﬁnite suspension ofall pledge
and house activities,Wilson said.

“My first intention was to see
if the IFC and SAC proceedings
had something in common. The
IFC proposed suspension of
pledge and house activities for
the indefinite future. The SAC
thought hazing incidents were so
blatant that [probation] would be
much too light. Yet we wanted to
give the house a fighting chance
to survive.”

Wilson said he also consid-
ered the position of the FIJI
pledges in his decision.

“There were seven pledges
who wanted to have a fraternity
experience. We can ‘t restore that.
The [suspension] can’t focus en-
tirely on them. That was a con-
sideration," he said.

Wilson said the provision for
a review of the fraternity‘s
progress in January 1995 may
give FIJI a chance to become
active again before the official
June 1995 end ofthe suspension.

FIJI President Ralph “Moke"
Wolfe saidthe decision came asa
surprise to the FIJI members and
the house corporation.

“Right now they’re kind of
stunned, as are we," Wolfe said.
“Jack Nordberg was under the
impression that it [the appeal]
would go very favorably. It has
become apparent that he [Presi-
dent Wilson] has taken the word
of one pledge over the word of
seven other students. He has made
the contention that we are cir-
cling our wagons to protect the
fraternity. That’s untrue. "

Nordberg, ’79, is FIJI's new

house corporation president.

Wolfesaid FIJIwillworkwith
the house corporation to develop
the action plan recommended by
SAC by the May 1 deadline.

Wolfe said the seven mem-
bers of FlJI’s pledge class have
rejected SAC’s offer of letting
the pledges live in FIJI’s frater-
nity house on Preston Street.

“They think it’s a slap in the
face," Wolfe said.

Although the university does
not define any method for further
appealofthedecision,Wolfe said,
the fraternity “will explore other
avenues” of reversing the sus-
pension decision.

Nordberg said the university
has departed from its own written
policy in the handling ofthe FIJI
case.

“The university has refused to
comply with its own statements
and policies in the student hand-
book,” Nordberg said. ”SAC has
acted outside its authority as a
governing body.”

“The house corporation has
conducted an extensive review
ofalluniversity documentswhich
discuss hazing —— in the White
Book, The Student Handbook—
there is only one mention of haz-
ing,” Nordberg said. “There is no
definition and no sanction. What
is clear is that suspension can
only occur if a chapter was on
critical probation or if the inci-
dent was so serious that it threat-
ened physical harm, damage of
property, or death.“

TheStuderztHandbookdefines
the punishments SAC may im-
pose on a fraternity or sorority for
violations of PanHellenic, Inter-
fratemity Council, or University
policies and guidelines.

action, place the fraternit_v/soror-
ity on critical probation for a pe-

sorority from the university.

The Student Handbook de-
scribesthe university‘sand lFC’s
policy and definition of hazing.

By-Law VII oftheIFC consti-
tution states in Section 3: “All
forms of hazing are strictly pro-
hibited. A serious incident, even
as a first reported offense, may be
grounds for suspension or expul-
sion of the chapter."

Section 4 ofthe by-law states:
“No initiation or pledge training
activity shallconstitute any physi-
cal or emotional hazard to the
individual. Such potential haz-
ards include: alcohol abuse, dan-
gerous physical exertion or ex-
haustion. physical or emotional
violence, paddling or other types
of abuse. No chapter will exer-
cise jurisdiction over pledges
when such activity will hinder
the pledges academic work in
any manner.

Section 6 states: “No pledg-
ing activities are to take place in
or around the freshman dormito-
ries or after 8 p.m. Pledging ac-
tivities are restricted to one night
only during the academic week."

“There is no conclusive evi-
dence that hazing took place,"
Nordberg said. “The only guide-
line the fraternity believes was
broken is the IFC guideline not to
meet after 8 p.m. It is the house
corporations statement that this
issue goes much deeper than a
fraternity of 30 or so gentlemen
being suspended."
