°Woman reports rape

By Francesca Kefalas
Phi Executive Editor

A 21-year-old woman reported
she was raped in Graham-Lees Dor-
mitory Friday, police said.

Sgt. E.W. Straub of the Lexing-

,ton Police and Director of Washing-
ton and Lee Security Michael Young
have said the investigation is focus-
ing on a suspect who is not a student
at W&L.

“The focus is on one suspect at

rthis time,” Young said. “The focus is
leading us to a non—student."

Dean ofStudents David Howison
saidthe suspect was visitingthe cam-
pus and staying in the dorms over the
weekend. Young said he could not

‘confirm whether the suspect was a
prospective or the friend ofa student.
Young said the woman was in the
dorms selling magazine subscrip-
tions.The woman told police she was
invited into a room by the man who

"raped her.

Police said they received a call
reporting the rape from the Univer-
sity Center March 25 at 5:48 p.m.
The woman told police two women,
identified as W&L students, helped
the woman and called the police,
Young said.

The police came to the Univer-
sity Center to question the woman,
Young said.

& “When she was picked up at the

' [University] center she was very
shaken up,” Young said.

Young said after a police officer
comforted the woman she was taken

to Graham-Lees to try to identify the
room in which she was attacked.
Young met police and the woman
about 6 p.m., he said. Security and
the police have been working
together on the case since then,
Young said.

After looking inside Graham-
Lees the woman was taken to his
office and then to Stonewall Jackson
Hospital, Young said. After being
treated at the hospital, the woman
was taken back to the dormitory.

“We were looking basically for
the crime scene,” Young said.

Young said the investigation be-
gan broadly, looking throughout most
of Graham-Lees. The woman gave a
detailed description ofthe area ofthe
dorm and the room she was assaulted
in, he said.

“We were able to determine
where she had been and where she
hadn’t been,” Young said.

The investigation resumed on
Sunday, Young said, and focused on
the first floor of Graham-Lees. He
said 15 to 20 rooms were examined.

“The investigation took all week-
end,” Young said.

Young said security and police
think they have identified the crime
scene and have confiscated some
items that might serve as evidence.
He said Straub has talked with sev-
eral students about the incident, but
both police and security are focusing
on a non-student suspect.

The woman gave a detailed de-
scription of the man she said attacked
her, Young said. He said police have

not released the description of the
suspect because they do not want to
jeopardize the investigation. The
suspect is no longer in the state,
Young said, which complicates the
investigation. The suspect had not
been notified of the investigation as
ofTuesday at 4 p.m., Young said. He
said security and the police will
have to rely on help from police in
other states.

Straub said the woman, who is
not a Lexington resident, is no longer
in Lexington but is pursuing the case.

“She wishes to press charges as
soon as we arrest whoever is respon-
sible,” Straub said.

Straub said the woman examined
photos in an attempt to identify the
suspect. Young said the woman’s
description of her attacker has been
important in identifying the suspect.

Young and Straub both said they
do not know how long it will take
them to get more information. Young
said anyone who has information
about the assault should call secu-
rity at 463-8427 or the police at
463-2112.

“Our main focus is to make sure
[the woman] is taken care of and we
find this individual as soon as we
can,” Young said.

Editors Note.‘ The current policy of The
Ring-tum Phi when reporting rape cases is to
withold the names of both the accuser and the
accused until after the trial. If the accused is
found guilty the name will then be published.
In the above case neither name has been
released by the police or security. The Phi '5

policy is subject to change under each indi-
vidual editorial board.

WBRC changes appr

By THOMAS HEsPos
Phi News Editor

The Executive Com-
mittee finished its first trip
through the White Book
Review Committees sug-
gested changes to the White
Book on Monday.

Some amendments
were agreed upon and
passed in two successive
meetings — these amend-
mentsareofficially ratified
and will be added to next
year’s version ofthe White
Book. Others must be ap-
proved at the EC’s next
meeting after the spring
break on Monday,April 18.

Major changes to the
White Book include:

°Changes to Paragraph
0 of the Procedure for an
Executive Committee
Hearing that allow for an
accused student to discuss
an honor situation with
family members or others
who can offer support.

Changes to Paragraph
F of the Procedure for a
Student Body Hearing that
increases the number of
guilty votes needed to con-
vict a student in an open
trial from eight to nine.

‘Changes to Paragraph
D of the Procedure for an
Executive Committee
Hearing that allow the ac-
cused to request disclosure
of the investigative team’s
report, so the accused can
enter  closed trial with a
better idea of why a par-
ticular witness has been
called by the EC. ‘

WBRC Chairman
Ames Hutton said the
changes to Paragraph 0

will allow the EC to use
discretion in punishing the
accused for breaches of
confidentiality. He said the
accused should be given the
right to discuss an honor
matter with people who
could offer advice or emo-
tional support, such as an
adviser or a parent.

“The accused could
possibly be scared by talk-
ing to parents,” said Hutton.

EC President Bob
Tompkins said the amend-
ment would, at the same
time, allow for the punish-
mentofanyoneinvolvedin
an honor trial who breaks
confidentiality in away that
harms the accuser, accused
or witnesses.

“There’s a lot of con-
cern on the part of some-
body who turns something
in that his name is not
dragged through the mud.”
said Tompkins.

The amendment to
Paragraph 0 was ap-
proved 13-0 after three
votes and minorchangesto
the language.

The EC approved
unanimously an amend-
ment that makes it tougher
for juries to convict an ac-
cused student in an open
trial. The number of guilty
votes required for convic-
tion was raised to nine
from eight.

Hutton said the amend-
ment would not change the
application of the honor
system drastically.

“There were concerns
that ‘why was it not unani-
mous?’” Hutton said.

Several EC members
agreed that conviction in

an open trial should not re-
quirea unanimous vote. EC
Law Rep. James Rambeau
saidthe change to the num-
berofguilty votes required
“would be beneficial to the
system as a whole.”

The EC also approved
a suggested
change to the
rules for disclo-
sure in a closed
hearing. WBRC
member Mike
Stakes said the
p r o p o s e d
change would
allow the inves-
tigators and ad-
vocates in-
volved in an
open trial to
clear away ex-
traneous infor-
mation. Such
inforrnation,ac-
cording to
Stakes, slows
down hearing
proceedings.
Hutton agreed.

“There is a lot of extra-
neous information that the
advocates try to get out,”
Hutton said.

The new amendment
allows the accused to re-
quest the report of the in-
vestigators which ex-
plains why individual wit-
nesses are being called to
the hearing. In this way,
the advocates representing
the accused can avoid irrel-
evant lines of questioning
and save time by “narrow-
ing issues ahead of time,"
said Stakes.

The EC approved this
amendment 11-2.

The EC also voted to
