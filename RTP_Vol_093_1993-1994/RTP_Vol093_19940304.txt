SAE gets
social
probation

By MELISSA SAWYER
Phi Staff Writer

Sigma‘ Alpha Epsilon’s
pledges got a special treat this
weekend in the form of an early
initiation.

The fraternity took the action
in response to a breach of an
agreement with its housing cor-
poration. Curt Smith,
Int temity Council president,
sai' the housing corporation did
not think SAE was properly com-
pleting the pledge program.
Smith said the violation of their
pledge education program in-
volved keeping the pledges at the
ho e past established hours and
improperly making the pledges
participate in house clean-ups.

SAE President Richard
Sherrill said the house’s pledge
program was implemented in the
same fashion as in years past. “It
w n’t any different than any
other year, except that we had
different pledges," Sherrill said.

Smith said SAE’s housing
corporation put the house on a
special probation. Sherrill did
not conﬁnn this.

“We had an agreement with
[th9 housing corporation] to take
steps to restructure our pledge
program to comply with «IFC and ‘
national standards, and we did
not act in accordance with the
rules,” Sherrill said.

The’IFC,' acting on an anony-
mas tip, also investigated SAE’s
pledge program.

Smith said SAE was found
guilty of . violating deferred
pledgeship rules from last fall

house received two weeks of so-
ciaﬂ probation, effective after

Rush plan
goes to SAC

By MELISSA SAWYER
Phi Staff Reporter

Next year’s Rush will follow
a plan similar to this year’s after
all.

The lnterfraternity Council
voted on Tuesday to send a Rush
plan presented by senior Ryan
Donaldson to the Student Affairs
Committee.

After holding discussions in
its meetings for three weeks, fra-
ternity representatives voted
unanimously for Donaldson’s
plan, which proposes that all Rush
dates would be completed by
September 23.

~ The alternative to
Donaldson’s plan, presented by
junior Adam Plotkin, defers Rush
until fall break.

IFC President Curt Smith said
although deferred Rush would
not be considered again for next
year, discussions about a pos-
sible fall break or winter Rush
would continue in lFC this spring.

“We’re just trying to get a
general consensus of what will
work best next year,” Smith said.
“lt’s not an open and shut case.”

week, Officer F.W. Smith of the

Trustees raise tuition

The price of a W&L education will be $13,750

9 By PHIL CARROT!‘
Phi Staff Writer

Tuition for the 1994-95 school year will
be 4.96 percent more than the $13,100 charged
this year, which translates into an additional
$6 0. This is the smallest increase in the last
10 years.

The Board of Trustees met last Friday and
Saturday in Houston to decide, among other
things, the budget and tuition for next year.

“The [national] inﬂation rate for next year
we figured to be about 3.5 percent, but the
rate [the university] uses is the higher educa-
tioh price index rate, which is about 1 percent

higher than the the national inﬂation rate,”
said University Treasurer Lawrence
Broomall. “An awful lot [of the increase] is
devoted to updating computer equipment,
buying books for the library . . . and salary
increases for returning faculty.” A
The budget for the 1994-95 school year,
which will be ﬁnalized at the trustees’ May
meeting, totals around $40 million. Univer-
sity Rector A. Stevens Miles said the trustees
“were pleased these ﬁgures came in under
the guidelines set [at the October meeting].”
Approximately 70 percent of the budget
goes toward paying salaries. The rest is for
supplies. Broomall broke it down further into
academic departments (instruction), 55 per-

cent; academic support (deans of the college,
Commerce School, the law school, the li-
brary, computing), 10-12 percent; student
services (financial aid ofﬁce, registrar, deans
of students, freshmen, etc.), 10-11 percent;
institutional support (administration, man-
agement), 10 percent; Buildings and Grounds,
9 percent. All ﬁgures are approximations.
Financial aid was increased by 11 percent
over this year. The board wanted to have
more aid available to more students, accord-
ing to Broomall. The ﬁnancial aid budget is
just under $5 million and is taken from the
university’s endowment.
The capital campaign and annual fund are
both doing well in comparison to years past,
especially the annual

Washington and Lee’s Board of Trustees post
poned the removal of eight authentic Confederat
ﬂags from Lee Chapel.

11 ﬂags were scheduled to be retume

to the‘Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond. Th
ﬂags were originally loaned to W&L by the Cogfed
eracy museum in the 1930s.

Only eight of the eleven ﬂags were on displa
around Robert E. Lee’s statue in Lee Chapel. Th
Museum of the Confederacy had concerns about th

of the flags, and had plans to restor

them. Restoration would cost $8,000 for each ﬂag.

The ﬂags were to be replaced by replicas donate -
by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. ‘

The Trustees postponed the ceremony after read
ing a newspaper article about the removal of the flag
from Lee Chapel. According to W&L Director oi
Communications Brian Shaw, the Trustees wanted I o
be absolutely sure of the ownership of the ﬂags.

Commission sees parking problems’

By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Staff Writer

Washington and Lee University may
be out of approximately 30 to 50 park-
ing spaces for the next four years.

Last Thursday, the Lexington Plan-
ning Commission raised concerns about
the possible loss of spaces due to the
construction of the new science center.
Commission member Camille Miller
expressed reservations about raising
those concerns to Washington and Lee
University after they had approved the
site unanimously.

“I’m not comfortable sending an-
other suggestion,” said Miller. “I can’t
back down.”

Commission member Timothy
Golden made a motion for a consensus
that there are some concerns with the
parking. The motion passed unani-
mously.

The commission also raised con-
cerns about parking for construction
workers. They estimated a net loss of
80 parking spaces for four years.

Coordinator of Capital Planning
Frank Parsons said 25 spaces behind
Howe Hall, 10 spaces by DuPont Hall
and 10 spaces in the ROTC parking lot
will be closed during the construction.
He said the parking lots will not be
closed at the same time.

Miller suggested the commission
make it a condition that construction
workers use an auxiliary parking space
provided by Washington and Lee Uni-
versity.

Washington and Lee Director of
Communications Brian Shaw, a city
council member who was absent from
the meeting, said the university shares
the commission ’s concerns about park-
ing but hopes the problem will be solved
by the time the project is completed.

“We have a lot of options for con-
struction workers,” Shaw said.

Shaw said in the past W&L has
negotiated with Virginia Military In-
stitute to provide parking space. He
said it was not unreasonable to ask the

contracting company to shuttle con- ‘

struction workers back and forth. He

said one of the possibilities might be
the parking lot on the right side of
Liberty Hall or the parking lot at the
Pavilion. He said it could be worked
into the contract with the company
paying.

Coordinator of Capital Planning
Frank Parsons said making the con-
tracting company provide shuttle buses
for construction workers is not uncom-
mon for congested areas.

Parsons said arrangements are be-
ing made with VMI to provide parking
behind Marshall Library. He said there
won’t be any access until constniction
starts.

“I anticipate them wanting satisfac-

tory answers for parking questions,”
said Parsons.

Parsons said there might be a possi-
bility of creating a temporary parking
lot from the excavated earth from build-
ing inﬁeld. He said he is investigating
the possibility with a general contrac-
tor who might be hired for the job. He
said there is also an unused parking
space by the Lenfest Center, but it
would not be convenient.

“On a campus like ours, you can’t
afford to offer everyone a parking space
30 seconds from your office,” he said.

Parsons said the planning commis-
sion does not want to tempt students
and faculty to park in city streets. L

“We’re trying to keep downtown
streets for customers,” he said.

Parsons said there is also the risk of
Special Services Officer R.D. (Bark
writing parking tickets for students and
faculty.

Shaw said he estimates the project

' will cost approximately $20 million

including renovations of Howe and
Pannly Hall. _

Shaw said construction will peb-
ably start this June. He said the project

will eventually be called the Science

Complex.

He said cost of the project comes
from donations and gifts to the capital
campaign.

Scholars get new blood ‘

By YABIZ SEDGHI
Phi Staff Writer

As of Feb. 4, the Univer-
sity Scholars program, aimed
at highly motivated and ex-
ceptional students, has ac-
cepted 17 new members.

According to Associate
Professor of English James
Warren, currently in charge
of the program, freshmen
with Gap’s of 3.25 and
sophomores with a GPA of
3.5 or better were invited to
apply. The 46 applicants had
to write an essay of interest
and were required to submit
a letter of recommendation
from a faculty member.

“The students this year
further underwent two sets
of interviews conducted by
teams of students in the pro-
gram and by pairs of faculty
members either presently in
the University Scholars com-
mittee or who have taught in
the program in the past,” said
Warren.

“We took into consider-
ation the SAT scores and

GPA’s of these students. We
could have easily doubled
the number accepted into the
program. It was an extremely
difﬁcult and imperfect deci-

 

close. We could not do it,”
said Warren. “The selection
process was not exclusively
based on grades or scores
either. We considered how

Out of the 18 positions
available, only 17 were
filled.

“We could have picked
any one of 10 people for that
last place. It was just too

said.

“We are extremely ex-
cited about the new mem-
bers and look forward to
working with them,” said
University Scholars Secre-
tary Allyson Gardner, ’95.

‘‘I am looking forward to
the interactive nature of the

program,” said freshman

Ko-Ming Chang.

According to Warreg, the
University Scholars pro-
gram consists of about 60
members. “The administra-
tion has approved to ﬁx up
the Red House, the former
East Asian studies building,
and it will serve as a mace
for these students to s udy,

continued Warren. “The
seminars are now open to

Salerno’s opens

By JAY WHrrE
Phi Staff Writer

In the last few weeks there have
been several additions to the Lexing-
ton area restaurant circuit in the form
of the expanding of old restaurants and
the grand openings of others.

There are some erasures from the
area, however. The Bone and The Sand-
wich Shop closed their doors. The space
the Bone once occupied is now for rent
and may become office space.

One of the new restaurants is
Salerno’s, located in the old Stop-ln
convenience store on Route 11. This
Italian restaurant is owned by Joe
Graziano and has a wide variety of
foods. There are more than a dozen
types of pizzas, 18 types of hot subs,
and two dozen types of cold subs. Prices
range from $4 for a pepper and egg sub
to $14 for a Sicilian Special pizza.
Salerno’s also offers hot homemade
soup and free reﬁlls. To top it off, there

is an all-day Wednesday Special that
offers a large 16-inch pizza for $4.95.
For entertainment, there is a juke box
and video games. Delivery will be of-
fered as soon as drivers are hired.
Sweet Things Ice Cream Shoppe

has expanded into the realm of candies.
According to owner Roger Koehler,
the new addition offers a “neat variety”
of jawbreakers, gummy candies, candy
pebbles, candy shells, and many oth-
ers. Sweet Things now offers 60 differ-
ent types of bulk candies for the same
price. The candies are displayed in
bins with scoops available for self-
service. The new candy shop is located
in a portion of the former seating area.
Southern Inn is included in the list

of expansions. According to owner
Mike Zitmore, the addition is “just
basically going to be a pub.” The pub
will be attached to the restaurant and
will offer the same menu as the restau-
rant without the formal atmosphere.
“People seem to be intimidated by a
white table cloth; here they can come
in forabeer and a burger,” said Zitmore.
The pub will have a 20-foot bar, tables,
chairs, and several televisions. Zitmore
commented that the addition to the
Southern Inn would, among other

things, be a place for people to come to
when other area bars got a bit too
crowded or “rowdy.” But Zitmore said

he hoped that he won’t have to com-

pete with those establishments. Con-

struction on the pub should begin this

month, with completion in April.

Five months worth of work on the construc-
tion of this year’s Fancy Dress has come down
to e ﬁnal minutes.

he Fancy Dress Construction Sub—Com—
mittee began working in October of last year
when the Fancy Dress Committee decided what
the theme would be. Construction Sub—Com—
mittee Chairman Joe Framptom said he then sat
down with the Decorations Committee. They
decided on an agreeable mix of what Decora-
tiolﬂl wanted and Construction could build.
' Once the decorations were decided upon,
plans for each corner of the Warner Gymna-
‘sium, Doremus Gymnasium, the hallway, the
balcony, and the entrance were drawn up and
lists of required lumber were made. In January,
‘Framptom combined all of the lumber lists and
werﬂ to four different lumber yards to get the
best price. He ended up purchasing lumber
‘from all four yards.
i Once the lumber had been purchased, it was
assembled in the Boiler Room, where construc-
tion began. The different items are “all built
like kits so they can ﬁt through the doors,” said
Framptom. A total of 91 ﬂat platforms were
built. ‘
Work continued in the Boiler Room and
inished pieces were moved to the Pavilion for
' painting. This is different from last year, when
all construction, including the building of ﬂats
and other pieces, was moved to the Pavilion
afte several weeks in the Boiler Room.
Framptom said the construction was not moved
to the Pavilion this year because they did not
have enough floor space in the Pavilion for all
of the decorations.

the Pavilion to the Warner Center. 2 or 3 am.

They were not able to place anything on the
floor of the Warner Gymnasium until Tuesday,
March 1, three days before FD. Between Sun-
day and Tuesday, all of the decorations were
stored in the hallway and the balcony. The
construction crew has been in the Warner Cen-

ter everyday since Tuesday until at least

posed to be done.

Construction Committee Sub-Chairperson Joe Framptom and Construction Committee
Member Tory Noto work in the Boiler Room at the beginning of the construction period.
They and other members of the committee, along with contract workers continued to
build in the Boiler Room, sending finished pieces to the Pavilion to be painted.

The firework display of past Fancy Dresses are part of Friday's festivities again this year.

Framptom said that they should finish by 6
p.m. on Friday. Last year, when Framptom was
a committee member, they were late to their
own banquet after the construction was sup-

He expects his crew to put in between 1500 and

The job does have its rewards, at least for
Framptom.

“Just getting to build with other people’s
lumber makes up for that,” said Framptom.

“I just like to build,” said Framptom.

In a way, the FD decorations are like term
papers. You stay up all night working and
finish three hours before they are due.

 

For the W&L Recordi

February 26, 1944 The Executive Committee an-
nounced its rules for that year’s Spring Formal:

1. No drinking shall be permitted.

2. Smoking shall be permissible in the balcony only.

3. All non-members of the W&L student body wishing to
attend the dance, except VMI cadets, must be
vouched for by a member of the student body.
Student vouchers shall be held responsible for
the actions of their vouchees.

4. Students and visitors to the dance are expected to
conduct themselves as gentlemen at all times.

5. Violations ofthe above rules shall be dealt with by the
EC and are punishable by a suspension of dance
privileges.

The problem of low income housing was addressed in
a series of The Ring—tum Phi articles starting February
28, 1969. The articles concerned the fact that VMI had
been purchasing tracts of land in the lower income
portions of Lexington with the intention of expansion.
An arising problem was that the rental property pur-
chased by VMI made the sellers have difﬁculties ﬁnding
living accommodations. Colonel J. Caner Hanes said he
would allow the people to stay in the houses for up to
three months before asking them to leave. The Rockbridge
Area Housing Corporation began to look into acquiring
federal aidto help in the construction of a new 40-unit
low-income housing facility. A perpetual problem was

the apathy of local rental property owners in ﬁxing up
their property since it would likely be demolished in the
future anyway.

March 1, 1984, The Phi reportedthe lnterfratemity
Council consid’ered”‘a policy for'bid’ding"independent
Washington and Lee students from attending fraternity

tion. IFC President Emery Ellinger’s primary argument
was the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board’s
prohibition of charging an admission fee to all non-
fraternity members and its added financial burden. Other
reasons Ellinger cited were the adverse effects of open-
party atmospheres, their inhibiting students’ joining of
fraternities (only 80% were afﬁliated), the existence of
an Independent Union, and the added security problems
Independents could cause. The proposal was deffered to
a subsequent IFC meeting.

February 23, 1989, the Phi reported that Rockbridge
County ’s House Mountain was put up for sale. Twoarea
conservation organizations, The Rockbridge Area Con-
servation Council and The Virginia Outdoors Founda-
tion, started a $325,000 fundraising drive to make sure
the land was kept out of the hands of developers. The two
groups were required to come up with the money by
April 8. As of press time, they had raised less
than $50,000.

Fireworks explode over Fancy Dress

By HILLARY OLSON
Phi Assistant Features Editor

The skies above Lexington will ﬁll
with fireworks after the Fancy Dress
Ball on Friday.

With an announcement before the
ﬁreworks begin, the organizers hope to
gather a large crowd of spectators.

Due to budgetary constraints, no
fireworks exploded in the spring of
1992, but they returned last Fancy
Dress.

Students can watch the light show
from outside the gym, near the foot-
bridge, or anywhere where the sky is
clear.

Publicity Committee Sub-Chair-
woman Kim Hardie said the ﬁreworks
after the ball are a “kind of tradition for
Fancy Dress.”

They ofﬁcially end the ball and “kick
of the weekend,” said Hardie.

Hardie said the ﬁreworks cost $2300
and an additional $870 was budgeted
for insurance.

The ﬁreworks will be set off by
Bruce Bretszky, a professional pyro-
technist who has done the FD ﬁrework
displays numerous times.

The ﬁreworks will be launched from
the ﬁeld above the stadium, but stu-
dents are encouraged to stay away from
the launch area.

Hardie said that the best spot to see
them is probably right outside the
Warner Center.

“You can probably see them from
just about anywhere, though,” said
Hardie.

The display will begin at 1 a.m. and
last about ﬁve minutes. It will slowly
build to a grand ﬁnale.

“I think it can’t be left

about 18 percent - you’re exceeding the actual ratio of law

I just think I know some of the problems we’re facing as
students at Washington and Lee. I think it’s more than a
question of being an undergraduate or a law student. Having
gone to W&L as an undergrad and served in a number of

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

Vote Monday

Next week the entire student body will have a chance
to vote for four of their peers who will determine the way
the student government is run next year.

In past years there has been appalling student apathy
concerning elections. Considering how much impact the
four elected students will possibly have on your lives you

. can’t help but wonder why students don’t care more.
Maybe it’s because most students don’t have personal
contact with the Executive Committee or the Student
Conduct Committee. No matter how much personal
contact you have with either group their actions, espe-
cially the EC’s, affect your life.

The EC governs the Honor System and determines the
budgets of most student organizations. Unless you are
specifically involved with an organization’s budget or an
honor trial, you will probably have no reason to even set
foot in the EC office. Law students will tell you just how
much the EC can affect your life, and how much you
should care about who you vote for.

When the EC was giving out funds last October there
was a real possibility it was going to severely cut the
funding of the Student Bar Association, the organization
that funds all law school groups. You can bet the law
students were very aware of who was representing them
then. If the EC was threatening to cut the Student Activi-
ties Board’s funds enough to make a Thursday night
Fancy Dress band impossible to afford, you can bet
students on both sides of the campus would be outraged.

On March 7, everyone can do their part to make sure
responsible people are in charge of the student govern-
ment. You’ll be on campus anyway. It can only take a
few minutes to check off the necessary boxes. Thursday,
there were speeches by each of the candidates. Hopefully
you got to go, but considering they were poorly publi-
cized, at four in the afternoon and in the commerce
school its likely the usual 10 spectators showed. Hope-
fully that guess was far short. The facts that almost no one
attends these speeches other than the candidates and that
no one cares enough to publicize them more than a few
hours before the actual event are at the root of student
voting apathy.

How are students supposed to make informed deci-
sions about who to vote for if they have no idea of the

the candiadates positions, then the voting process can be
nothing more than a popularity contest. We should have
gotten 'pa'st‘that in high school; I ' P ‘ ’

No one can make students vote. But the Voting Regu-
lations Board can take a step towards informing more
people about the elections by better publicizing the
speeches and holding them in the evening. Students are
too busy in the afternoons with classes and errands.
Furthermore, if students don’t know about the speeches,
how can they attend them?

Make sure you vote on Monday. If you don’t vote you
don’t have the right to complain if your student govern-
ment does something you don’t like.

Limbaugh misjudges liberal values

deﬁnition, I qualify as an “environmental wacko.”
I do believe that the Earth is fragile and that man is
its greatest enemy. Rush is right when he says man
and nature have existed for thousands of ye rs
without the Earth sustaining major damage.

This week I have decided to write about someone

book, The Way Things
Ought to Be. The person

who lent me the book sug-
gested that I read Rush’s

second book before writ- NOVA
ingthiscolumn; however, I QRKE
I do not know how long it C ’

would take to bring my-
self to read another Rush
book, so I am writing the
column now.

‘I have to say that Rush raises some good points.
Before anyone beginsto imagine that I agree with
him, Rush is completely wrong in characterizing the
ideals and motivations of most liberals. There are
some people who claim to be liberals and take on
causes to promote themselves. However, for myself
and most liberals I know the goal isto help people help
themselves and to preserve things important to man,
such as the Earth. I am not going to say we do not
benefit from this; however, for most of us it is neither
a monetary beneﬁt, or a feeling of moral superiority.

Rush suggests that many liberals run foundations
purely so they can siphon off large sums of money for
themselves, while still feeling good about helping
someone. Admittedly, there are people like that, and
they are present in conservative foundations as well.
However, most liberals do not run foundations. We
donate money and are just as upset when more contri-
butions are used for administrative purposes than
actually helping someone. I have stopped contribut-
ing to groups when I discovered they were using my
hard-earned dollars to pay for direct mailing.

Rush also suggests that liberals prefer to throw
money at a problem instead of actually solving it. First
of all, this is hardly a liberal fault. Look at AIDS, the
government does put money into it, although a rela-
tively small amount; but it does not appear willing to

true that is it possible

liberal community has been en-
gaged in teaching people about
means of preventing the spread
of the disease. At least we are
more willing to acknowledge the
problem.

Multiculturalism is another
area in which Rush misses the
point. Yes, we are all Americans

how far we’ve come as a group.

There are many, many areas in which I could
confront Rush; however, I think I will conclude with
the area that I feel strongest about. Under the Rush

It is only in the last ﬁve hundred years or so that
man has severely damaged the Earth. For thousands
of years, we did not use toxic pesticides, transport
billions of barrels of oil, cut hundreds of acres of
rainforest a day, detonate nuclear weapons, or drain
aquifers to the extent we do today. When we started
doing these things, we were hurt; schools starteﬂ to
diminish, water became harder to get, people began
to suffer from illnesses never before heard of. Yes

farmers are going back
' to pre-pesticide meth-
ods of farming. They
are ﬁnding that tﬂeir
crops are healthier and
so are they themselves.
I could go on end-
lessly on this topic of
why Rush is com-
pletely wrong. Instead,
I would like to mint
out two areas where
Rush could improve.
First, stop singing your

so; if not, saying you’re

U.S. can’t afford drug freedom

It is ironic that of all the columns
written this semester in the Phi , only
one written by a fellow conservative
has been able to motivate me to re-
spond. Perhaps this shouldn’t be so

actions with and without social conse-
quences, is clear (which it is not). Does
Mr. Kucera’s axiom still hold; should
there be no governmental regulation of
choices that are truly private? One of

 

surprising, the most
since all sorts popular il-
of opinions lustrations
seem to re- thatthisisnot
ceivetheawk- so involves
wardepithetof NICHOLAS L. the infamous
“conserva- seatbelt law.
tive” these WADDY, ’96 Not wear-
days. At any ing one’s
rate, I found seatbelt and
Mr. Kucera’s becoming
ideasaboutthe impaled by

legalization of marijuana, and more
importantly his ideas about the role of
government in society, distressing
enough to write a rebuttal.

The argument undergirding Mr.
Kucera’s entire case against govem-
mental restrictions on the recreational
use of marijuana, seemingly, is summed
up in this one phrase of his: “in a
country which puts a high premium on
freedom, those behaviors which do not
harm society should not be legislated
against.” In essence, Kucera restates
for us the age-old bit of liberal wisdom
that non-invasive morality (involving
moral choices that directly involveonly
the chooser, like smoking marijuana
by oneself) are the individual’s busi-
ness, and not the state’s. As Kucera
points out, such ideas are particularly
attractive in the United States, where
distrust of government runs very high
and where individualism is the central
creed of civil society. V

For argument’s sake, let us stipu-
late that the boundary between invasive
and non-invasive morality, between

one’s steering wheel, sufﬁce it to say,
seems to be a case in which one has
made a choice affecting only one’s
own life, and no one else’s. Does it
“harm society” when someone chooses
to do something stupid, and ends up
paying for it? It doesn’t seem to; it
might even provide us with good in-
centive to make our own free choices a
little better. And yet we still legally
mandate the wearing of seatbelts. Why?

The answer is quite simple really:
the leaders of the various states have
decided that they abhor hearing on the
news every night that another careless
driver has been killed because of his
unwillingness to buckle up. Perhaps
these officials and legislators have seen
pictures of just what a horrible scene
car accidents can be, and they want to
prevent them, even at the cost of re-
stricting “non-invasive morality” and
telling people what to do.

Experience has taught the politi-
cians an important lesson: freedom isn’t
always good enough. People can be
stupid, extremely stupid, and some-

times they have to be protected from
themselves. You can grandstand all
you like about the majestic virtues of
freedom and liberty, but this fact re-
mains: at least in the case of the seatbelt
law, less freedom saves lives, real hu-
man lives.

In my own view, the case of mari-
juana is similar. People may choose to
take marijuana of their own free will; it
may even be the case that they hurt no
one else by doing so (to my knowledge
this is always false, by the way, but we
will stipulate it); even so, I deny that it
should be legal. Just as we don’t allow
people to drive without seatbelts, we
should not allow people to degrade and
injure themselves by becoming slaves,

Gautier and his motley band of Pyl-
sian potheads has escaped my atten-
tion. And even if marijuana did in-
crease one’s creative abilities, I would
still oppose its legalization. How ut-
terly pathetic to think that the products
of one’s mind might be the result of
some chemical additive. Whatbeoo es
of the idea that we should ﬁght our own

battles in life? After all, if we can take '

marijuana to be “creative,” then why
not cocaine for pleasure or valium to
unwind?

In sum, it is not my opinion that
government exists only to defend t e
liberty of individuals. Of course g v-
emmental regulations can, and often
do, go too far in stipulating behavior,

Everybody loves a carpet ride  

DREAM LAND
Richard Weaver

Once upon a time, in a land real, real
close by, there lived a magical Arabian
prince named Sinbaner. Sinbaner was
re lly bored in his magical palace, and
he was looking for a small town in the
heart of the Old South to visit and
spread mirth and joy and let’s not for-
get Arabian culture to its residents.

Sinbaner took his magic carpet up I-
81 and, looking for new members for
his harem, he exited at the sign for The
Nﬁv and Reﬁnanced Southern Vir-
ginia College for Women (or “Sem”
for short). Quickly finding no suitable
candidates, Sinbaner took Route 11 for
several miles until he heard angels sing-
ing and saw a bright light. Then he saw
the sign that says it all: “Lexington
Cigz Limits.”

Sinbaner pulled into town and
quickly saw Rockbuster record store.

“This looks like the cultural center
of this city. I think I’ll stop here and
ﬁnd out what the big commotion is this
weekend,” Sinbaner said.

£1" wo Lexington residents watched
Sinbaner as he turned into the
parking lot:

BUCK: Look at this guy here on the
ﬂying carpet. He looks Indian, like
Rajiv.

BILLY: (Billy spits).

JZUCK: Or maybe he’s Arabian. I

. wonder if he gets carpet burns on that

thing. Anyway, let’s go see if we can
lend our assistance to this visitor to our
little city.

BILLY: (Billy spits again).

BUCK: Maybe we can tax him for
something. Or sell his carpet on the
black market.

B I L L Y :

SINBANER: I’m going!

Come on, I’ll take you there,” Tom
said. I

Sinbaner thanked Tom anyway but
decided to try W&L first. Sinbaner
went back to his carpet, only to find a
new tag on it: a gift from R.D. Clark,

the dark prince of Lexington parking.

“I’ll get you my pretty R.D. And

your little dog too!” Sinbaner cackled.

Sinbaner then ﬂew over to the Reid
Hall circle and brought his carpet to a
screeching halt when he saw the most
glorious vision: a beautiful girl carry-
ing her own FD tickets, wearing a ﬂow-
ing formal dress, holding up a sign that
said “Dateless.”

“This is the girl,” Sinbaner said.
“She will be mine; oh yes, she will be
my date for Fancy Dress.”

Sinbaner stepped off his carpet and
asked Letitia to go with him, and she
said yes! Letitia climbed onto the car-
pet, and away they went, with
Steppenwolf pumping out of the car-
pet stereo.

That night Sinbaner and Letitia ar-
r_ived at the ball with a ﬂourish. They
were a beautiful couple, he with his
baby blue tux and she with her dande-
lion yellow sequined gown (with ruby
red shoesl). They danced the music of
Kool and the Gang of Supreme
Vandella Marvellettes, and posed for
pictures, and stepped over the bodies
of other FD ballgoers who didn’t make
it all the way through.

“This is great,” Sinbaner said. “And
to think, I almost went to Salem and
hung out with my parents this week-
end. I’m coming back to Fancy Dress
every year!”

The ball soon came to a close, and
Sinbaner and Letitia stepped onto their
magical carpet to leave. They ﬂew
above the ﬁreworks and yelled out
from the stars, “Happy Fancy Dress to
all, and to all a good night.”

Clarke misrepresents beliefs of pro-life movement

To the editor:

‘Those who have examined the abortion issue and
taken a position will rarely be persuaded to change it.
The abortion debate will always be decisive and
inﬂammatory. However, either position can be intel-
ligently articulated in a manner that promotes con-
structive dialogue and doesn’t misrepresent the op-
posing side.

‘Unfortunately, Nova Clarke’s column from before
Washington break, We Must Preserve Roe v. Wade,
did neither. Miss Clarke either doesn’t understand the
pro.-.1.ife. perspective 0ISiU1P1.Y°h95§‘9W5.9ﬁ?9.°mP‘Y
rhetoric instead.

I’d like to address these misunderstandings. Let
me begin with her “pet peeve.” Miss Clarke objected

u topeing addressed as a “pro-abort.” We pro-lifers

don’t call our opponents pro-abortion to be vindictive
or annoying. We simply want to remind them (and the
public) what the choice they are defending entails. We
object to the term “pro-choice” because it is
deceptive.

First, the term implies that pro-lifers oppose
“choice.” We are all about choice in a free society —

, tha is what democracy is all about. However, even

abortion advocates will admit that there are limits to
those choices, particularly when they may violate the
choices and rights of others. The abortion debate is not
about “choice.” If it were really about choice, Miss

. Clark would not be championing social health care.

Foitunately, in this country we women have many
chﬁices, and we ought to concentrate on exercising
those choices responsibly. According to the Centers
for Disease Control (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services), 98% of all abortions are done for
birth control reasons. And according to the Alan
Gutmacher Institute (the research branch of Planned
Parenthood), half of all abortions are performed on
wtﬁnen who chose to use abortion as their only means

I of birth control.

If we must talk about “choice” in this debate then
perhaps we should emphasize the choice available to

‘Clarke claimed. We actually believe that no one has I

women before they become pregnant and not after-
wards when the choice is at the expense of their
children.

Which brings us to the second related objection
pro-lifers have to the term pro-choice. “Pro-choice”
effectively, but falsely, frames the debate in terms of
“choice,” thus ignoring the very concern pro-lifers
believe they are fighting for— human life. From the
pro-life perspective, the debate is about the human life
they believe is destroyed during every abortion. So it
is unfair to say that pro-lifers believe that “the law has
full jurisdiction over a woman’s uterus,” as Miss

among many, abortion counselor J oss Sawyer writes
that “adoption is a violent act” compared to the
“simply remedy of early, safe abortion.”

In reality, contrary to Miss Clarke’s accusations,
it is really the pro-lifers who are giving women the
genuine choices. Pro-lifers operate over 2,000 cri-
sis pregnancy centers which provide medical, fi-
nancial, and psychological support to women in
need. Miss Clarke claims that “the pro-lifers are
certainly not looking after [pregnant mothers.]”
Furthermore, she writes, “Who is going to want to
adopt these babies? Certainly not the pro-lifers.”
Miss Clarke is wrong to portray pro—lifei‘s.as‘,uncar-
ing and irresponsible. Let me provide a personal
example.

One woman I know has single-handedly placed
about sixteen children with adoptive parents, at
great personal expense in terms of time, money, and
emotional cost. They have all been “hard to place”
children ~— black, Hispanic, and Indian. She has
had babies in her home with malnutrition, parasites,
scabies, AIDS — some of whom stay for months.
She counsels the women, pays their doctor bills,
changes diapers, and initiates the legal procedures
for adoption. She has adopted two of these children
herself (one of whom survived her mother’s at-
tempt to abort her), both Cuna Indians from Panama.
This woman, my mother, represents the commit-
ment of pro-lifers everywhere, and I do hope Miss
Clarke will take the time to meet her when she
comes up for graduation.

Miss Clarke and I will probably never come to
an agreement on the issue of abortion, but it is
important to understand each other’s position. Even
if the abortion proponents completely disagree with
pro-lifers, they must understand that because we
believe 1.6 million children die every year as a
result of this lamentable “choice,” their battle to
“preserve Roe v. Wade” will never end.

complete jurisdiction over anyone’s body — includ-
ing those of unborn children. If I didn’t believe that a
human life was destroyed during every abortion, I
would be right next to Ms. Clarke at those NARAL
demonstrations defending a woman’s right to choose.

Third, the term implies the pro-abortion move-
ment promotes genuine choice regarding crisis preg-
nancies. If the pro-abortion side is only concerned
with providing women the option of aborting, then
why are they so hostile towards informed consent and
adoption? Informed consent is not a pro-life lecture
designed to dissuade women from having abortions.
The majority of proposed informed consent laws
require someone to tell the woman the risks of and
alternatives to abortion, the probable gestation period
of her unborn child, and the risks associated with
childbirth. The point of informed consent is to prevent
a woman from making an uninformed choice which
she may later regret.

The pro-abortion side also attacks adoption as a
choice. For example, you may be familiar with the
televised Arthur DeMoss Foundation ads (“Life ——
What a Beautiful Choice”) promoting adoption. In
response to these ads, Alexander Sanger of New York
City ’s Planned Parenthood stated, “The DeMoss Foun-
dation ads should be seen for what they are: a stealth
weapon in that Foundation’s attack on abortion. . .” To

provide another representative pro-abortion response Christine Will, ’94

The Ring-tum Phi, March 4, 1994

Alumnus offers views on White Book revisions '

MY VIEW

Walter T. Dudley, '74, ’79L

I was invited to participate as the
alumni member of the Honor System
panel sponsored by ODK on the evening

of January 19, which was an unfor1u- ’

nate casualty of the ice storm. I harbor
no illusion that anyone was disap-
pointed not to hear from me, but I want
to take this opportunity to express some
of my own views and concerns about
the Honor System.

Although I spent four years on the V

Alumni Association Board '_,of -,Dire"c-I

tors, I have no authority to speak for all»;
alumni. I do hope that myhfrequent :

contacts with alumni and myservice as

student body president almost 20 years ’ '

ago afford me some small license to
make the following observations.

The recent cheating scandal at the
Naval Academy has brought criticism
for allegedly inadequate education of
the midshipmen about their system.
We owe it to every Washington and
Lee student to do everything possible
to make sure that he or she understands
the broad concepts of the Honor Sys-
tem and the details of how it works.
Given our small size, we can accom-
plish this task with modest effort.

There is nothing wrong with study-
ing the Honor System periodically to
make sure that it is fairly designed and
administered through the White Book.
Healthy debate about various aspects
of the Honor System has been taking
place for many years, and that is a good
sign. We should be alanned only if we
approach complacency about honor or
the Honor System so that it is rarely
discussed.

That said, I hope that we take care to

‘distinguish between those who have

genuine’ desires to improve and

1- strengthen the Honor System from

those who may campaign on that plat-
form, but whose silent agenda is to
weaken or do away with the Honor
System for some reason.

Reasonable people can disagree over
some of the issues being considered by
the White Book revision committee. It
is not difﬁcult; to understand why an
accused student may be troubled by
allowing the two members of the Ex-
ecutive Committee who participate in
the initial investigation also to vote on
guilt or innocence. Perhaps it would be
smart to remove the potential appear-
ance of;som_e’=-bias by changing this
procedure, bugwill we be happy with a

“smaller E.C. making the decision?

, Perhaps something greater than a
2/3 majority of the Executive Commit-
tee should be required for conviction.
That is also an issue on which people
who believe equally in the fundamen-
tal concept of honor can disagree.

A difficult issue is whether the no-
tation on a student’s transcript should
be different if he or she appeals the
Executive Committee conviction
through an open hearing in Lee Chapel
and is convicted. One can argue that
this punishes unfairly a student for
exhausting his or 'her"right to an, open
hearing, but we cannot ignore other
important considerations. I

Executive Committee honor hear-
ings are a demanding, time-consuming
experience for the members of the Com-
mittee. Open honor hearings in the
Chapel increase the time commitment
substantially. The open hearing is a
valuable right, but the System should
dissuade frivolous appeals which could
be pursued if there is truly nothing to
lose. Maybe the painful decision to
make the entire student body aware of

the case by pursuing an appeal is a
sufﬁcient safeguard, but I hope that we
can retain a balanced approach to this
issue.

Consideration is also being given to
whether or not a speciﬁc ﬁnding of
dishonorable intent should be added to
the White Book and required for a
conviction. This is an important con-
cept, but the absence of a written intent

what is right and wrong as a member of
the Washington and Lee community. I
am convinced that this is preferable to
a written code.

As a lawyer, I have profound re-
spect for due process and other consti-
tutional rights afforded by our criminal
justice system. That does not translate
into any belief that the Honor System
would be better or stronger if it were

These Subtle iS-   expulsion'

sues of interpreta- I respectfully
tion and meaning suggestthateach

reveal an essential strength of the Wash-
ington and Lee Honor System. Not
only is it entirely administered by stu-
dents, but the “deﬁnition” of what is
and is not an honor violation is
determined by the current student
generation.

Some argue that this allows the sys-
tem to be applied unevenly, but I saw
no evidence of that as a member of the
Executive Committee. At Washington
and Lee, students are judged by fellow
students, guided by a fundamental con-
cept of honesty and their own sense of

LETTERS

of those cases can and should be dealt
with by the then-current student gen-
eration under the simple concepts of
the White Book. Listing numerous
possible offenses would not make the
system easier to administer. Any such
list will, by deﬁnition, be incomplete.
What will be done with a case that
“falls between the cracks” of the writ-
ten code? Surely there will be cries of
unfairness, lack of clarity, or a miscar-
riage of student justice when such a
system cannot ﬁnd the “right answer”
in the written code, and must exercise

judgment instead.

Two other concepts deserve atten-
tion. First is the notion that something
is wrong with our Honor System be-
cause no one else has one quite like it.
Without wanting to sound arrogant, I
think that other universities might do
well to borrow from Washington and
Lee rather than the other way around.
What is laudable about doing away
with the single sanction just because
others have seen ﬁt to do so? Were any
of those schools ever rooted quite as
deeply in the fundamental concept of
honor as the one bearing the names of
our two great founding fathers. The
fact that such a system calls upon Wash-
ington and Lee students to make difﬁ-
cult, potentially life-altering deci-
sions about their peers should not turn
us away from an Honor System
which promotes honor by discourag-
ing any meaningful compromise of
the concept.

I believe that the single sanction has
a positive impact on the administration
of the Washington and Lee Honor Sys-
tem. The severity of this punishment
surely operates as a sobering inﬂuence
which causes the Executive Commit-
tee and any student jury to think long
and hard before voting to convict a
student of an honor violation.

If time has shown that the Honor
System is not perfect, it has also shown
that the single sanction operates as a
safeguard against doubtful or errone-
ous convictions. I believe that Wash-
ington and Lee students charged with
administering this sacred trust bend
over backwards to be fair, to act in
good faith, and to reach the right result.
If lesser penalties were available, the
concept of honor would be compro-
mised and the latitude in penalties
would create a whole new set of con-
cems over whether a particular Execu-

tive Committee or student jury was too
heavy-handed or too lenient compared
with another one.

I hope that Washington and Lee will
also reject the notion that honor is olt
of date, or that the principles of the
Honor System have no relevance in
today’s world. In my opinion, nothing
could be further from the truth. Con-
sider any recent scandal or breach of
trust by a public ofﬁcial or business
person.

It seems clear that a lack of respect
for the fundamental principles of hon-
esty, trust, and honorable conduct are
at the core of many of these problems.
If that premise is correct, let us not do
anythingwhich willweakenourHonor
System, or result in lowering this projd
standard to a lower common denomi-
nator. My fervent hope is that those
students in charge of the current
study of the White Book will
recommend those charges they deem
necessary to strengthen and reaffirm
the Honor System, and re ‘st
vigorously anything which wou (1
weaken it.

Rector Steve Miles said it splen-
didly in Lee Chapel on January 31:
“We must continue to place the highest
priority on the principles of honor es-
tablished by General Lee. The Honor
System deﬁnes our institution and s
a great and ongoing inﬂuence on the
lives of all our graduates. Our resolve
to uphold the Honor System must not
weaken.”

Amen.

To the editor:

Once again, Patrick McDermott,
’94, has taken to The Ring-tum Phi
editorial pages to provide us with a
politically correct elixir on how to
combat the racism here at Washington
and Lee.

Usually pontiﬁcations from the po-
litically correct crowd are so self—evi—
dently stupid that any written response
is wholly unnecessary. In this case,
however, I am compelled to reply to
Mr. McDermott.

No true PC follower could write an
article on racism in the month of Feb-
ruary without fawning all over Black
History Month and Mr. McDermott is
no exception. In any event, what ex-
actly is Black History Month supposed
to accomplish? According to Mr.
McDermott the “special programming

etc. serve to commemorate “the role of

thinking ultimately undermines any
legitimate attempt to purge racism from
our culture. In fact, such thinking only
fosters racial division and animosity in
this country.

Perhaps Mr. McDermott, and he’s
far from alone, has forgotten what the
word racism actually means. Asl un-
derstand it, a racist act is one motivated
purely by reason of skin color. That is,
this person is unﬁt/ﬁt, bad/good, or
undesirable/desirable solely because he
was born into a particular race. As a
result, I ﬁnd it highly ironic that we as
Americans ﬁnd it desirable (maybe it’s
forced upon us) to devote an entire
month to activities which select certain
people for adulation based purely on
their race.

What could be more racist than that?

way we honor Abraham Lincoln, Tho-

Mr. McDermott must get over, as must
many others, is that slavery and the
culture of slavery are gone. It is time to
move forward toward a color-blind
society once and for all. This will un-
doubtedly take time, but the sooner we
get started, the sooner we’ll arrive.
This obsession with skin color must
stop if we are ever to achieve a racist-
free society.

You further mislead your readers by stating in your
editorial and your front page story that the reason the EC

dictionary means racial diversity and

such limited usage exposes the hypoc-

risy of his thinking. Is the successful
measure of an institution’s diversity

measured by skin color breakdown or

by its intellectual diversity?

I hope it’s the latter because that’s
what counts. Imagine the outcry were

someone to declare that Howard Uni-

versity was intellectually bankrupt be-

cause not enough white males attended.

We should be similarly outraged when
those among us suggest that Washing-

ton and Lee “has a long way to go when

it comes to achieving diversity” when
their indicia of diversity relies purely
on skin color rather than intellect or

philosophy.

The ﬁnal part of Mr. McDerrnott’s
column demonstrates the shallowness
of his thinking. He proudly proclaims

that “many of (his) very best friends
here are African-Americans.” The last
time I heard that phrase was from the
lips of Archie Bunker. Such declara-
tions seem to indicated that Mr.
McDermott places a high priority on
skin color with respect to the people he
names as friends.

He then goes on to explain the
notable achievements of these friends
in order to pronounce what wonderful
embodiments of Black History Month
these students represent because, “un-
like the rest of us, [they] have had to
rise above a separate set of obstacles on
their way to success.” How patently
insulting!

The Ring-tum Phi, March 4, 1994

Six freshmen cosen as ‘Major Generals‘

By KEITH GRANT
Phi Staff Writer

For the first time since 1991, the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
women’s swimming title belongs to
Washington and Lee. The Generals
took first-place in all but one event at
last week’s Atlantic States/ODAC
Championships.

W&L posted the same number of
victories last year, but placed only third
overall because they were out—num-
bered and, thus, out-pointed by two
other squads.

What made this year any different?
In a word, freshmen. Six, to be precise.
The half-dozen’s addition to the team
not only added considerable talent, but
also the depth the Generals needed to
earn enough points to claim their first
ODAC and Atlantic States titles in
three seasons.

Therefore, WLUR and the Ring-
tum Phi have selected this exclusive
group of swimmers as the Major-Gen-
erals for the month of February.

Who are these fabulous freshmen?
The all—star list reads as follows: Staci
Bertelli, Danielle Burghardt, Maggie
George, Laura Marshall, Jen Miller,

and Anne Spencer. Head coach Kiki
Jacobs has called this group the best
freshman class she has had at W&L. It
is also, fortunately, the largest.

Despite the loss of All-American
Claire Dudley ’93, the team’s regular
season was nearly identical to last
year’s. The Generals were 8-4 overall
and won all three of their conference
meets, which extendedtheir ODAC
winning streak to 19 meets.

In conference competition, there was
little in the way of competitive worries
for W&L. Juniors Susan Fisher and
Brandi Henderson, and sophomore All-
American Rebekah Prince and class-
mate Jill Sheets paved the way as Wash-
ington and Lee crushed Sweet Briar
(175—86), Randolph-Macon Women’s
College (140-66), and Hollins (167-
84) for its regular season ODAC sweep.

However, when the Atlantic States/
ODAC Championships at Radford
came around, it was time for the fresh-
men to make waves.

Of the Generals eight All-ODAC
swimmers, four belong to our class of
Major-Generals: Bertelli, Miller,
Marshall, and Spencer.

Bertelli, an All-Ohio swimmer last
year in the 200-freestyle and 100-but-
terﬂy, took All-ODAC honors in six

events. Miller earned All-ODAC in the
50, 100, and 200-freestyles and also
was named the Swimmer of the Meet at
the Atlantic States/ODAC. Accordiﬁ
to Jacobs, these two are the best of this
outstanding class of swimmers.

“I had high expectations coming
into the season of [Bertelli and Miller],”
Jacobs said.

Bertelli and Miller both lived up to
them, as well. .While Bertelli swztn
away with a total of six victories at the
Championships, Miller ties Prince for
top scoring honors with seven titles.

Those three and Marshall form far
and away the top relay team in school
history. In fact, all five school records
that fell at Radford were broken by
W&L’s relays.

Spencer, All-ODAC in the 200-
breaststroke, may have been one of the
Generals’ biggest surprises in the ’94
season, according to Jacobs.

“Spencer and [Danielle] Burghardt
easily improved the most this seasog,”
said Jacobs.

With no seniors on the current ros-
ter, Jacobs is looking forward to con-
tinuing a winning tradition.

“We’re going to be very strong next
year,”Jacobs said. “We’ll bevery tough
to beat.” .

Generals. The four other
freshmen chosen include

Spencer.

Class of 1980 alumnus Ab Hammond gets a little exercise in the snow. Hammond
went cross-country skiing last night while the snow was at its heaviest. “These are
fabulous conditions,” Hammond said. “The snow is slick, fast and fun.” Hammond
skiied across most of the front campus before turning onto Lee Street toward the
post office. “I call it road Nordic,” Hammond said. Hammond said he recently
moved back to Lexington and is practicing orthodontry in town.

From Staff Reports

After five years, the Wash-
ington and Lee women’s track
team is still unofficial and still
unofficially the indoor champion
of the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference.

Though Lynchburg College
has topped W&L in the outdoor
championships for the past two
years, the Generals still managed
to pull out a victory, 152-132,

v and left Roanoke College, East-

ern Mennonite College and
Bridgewater College far behind.
Top performances in the meet
came from individual champi-
ons; senior Wendy Neel, 60-yard
dash, sophomore Amy Mears,
two-mile run, and freshman
Hollis Leddy, 440-yard dash. The
Generals’ mile (senior Amy
Brown, junior Kim Herring,
freshman Megan Hovda and
Leddy) and two-mile (freshmen
Heath Acuff, and Nat Messmore
junior Susan Deutsch, and) relay
teams were also champions.
Also checking in as top scorer
forthe Generals wasjunior Sarah
Gilbert, who scored in five events.

Gilbert placed second in the9lig ~

In 1993, Washington and Lee’s women’s

Nicole Ripken’s famous last-second Liberty
Hall score in the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence Championship sent the Generals to their
first National Collegiate Athletic Association
Tournament. This season, the women will have
to play knowing that each and every second their
opponents will be out to try to knock off the two-
time defending ODAC champions.

Nonetheless, some of the players believe
they can repeat last year’s dream season.

‘‘I think, given time, we can do just as well as
we always have done,” said junior Lindsay

Coleman, a two-year starter at center, will be
called upon to pick up much of the scoring load
lost with the graduation of 81-goal scorer Lisa
Dowling ’93. Coleman had 30 goals last season

Nonetheless, if the Generals are to three-
peat, it will likely be with considerably less
damage done to their opponents net.

With Dowling gone, the team loses W&L’s
all-time leader in goals (170), assists (60) and
points (230). Her record 81 goals last year nearly
doubled the school’s single-season mark of 45

trated on making up for graduation of key players.

“We’re really concentrating on having a strong

defense,” said Coleman. “That’s the best way to
compensate for the loss [of Dowling].”

The Generals return four defensive starters:

junior Sarah Aschenbach, junior Dana Cornell,

In addition, W&L has senior goalie Sarah Smith
back after a strong ’93 season of net-minding.
Smith, a tri—captain, posted a goals-against-aver-

This is not bad when your team averages 15
goals-per-game.

The biggest of Smith’s 131 saves came in the
final minute of the ODAC Final with Roanoke, a
save that sparked the Generals late charge that led
to Ripken’s goal. .

Returning with Ripken (37 goals) and Coleman
on offense is senior tri—captain Angie Carrington.
Carrington, who assisted on Ripken’s last-second
score versus Roanoke, netted 44 goals last season,

which was the third—highest single-season tally in

school history.

As the team, currently ranked eighth nationally
in Division III, prepares for the ’94 campaign, the
Roanoke Maroons are once again expected to be
their top competition.

The Generals have won three straight one-goal
games against their 1-8] rivals, all of which have

decided either the regular season or ODAC Tour-

nament Championship. The two schools are
scheduled to meet at the Liberty Hall Fields on
March 17. It will only be W&L’s second confer-

ence game of the season.

“l’d like to play them a little later in the
season, but it’s as early for them as it is for us,”

said Smith.

Getting in the way of the Generals’ prepara-
tion to defend their title has been (what else?)
the weather. Snow has kept the team mostly

indoors.

According to Smith, last Sunday was their
first outdoor practice on the field as a team.

“It’s been pretty chaotic, so far,” she said.
“We’re doing as much as we can.

The women’s season opens with two away
games, March 9 at Bridgewater and March 1 2 at
Salisbury State, before the Generals make their
Lexington debut against Roanoke.

The men, not to be out-done, have also gained

national respect.

Staying on top of the pack is always one of the
hardest tasks is sports, and a team that looses
four All-Americans can hardly be expected to
remain one of the best squads in the sport.

Washington and Lee’s men’s lacrosse squad
has done just that, winning their first game and
garnering a national ranking of ninth by the

USILA in Division III.

The Generals opened the season with a win
against St. Mary’s of Maryland. W&L trailed 3-
1 early before scoring five straight goals to take

control of the game.

According to coach James Stagnitta, the team

was playing at about the right level.

“What happened Saturday was about what I
expected,” Stagnitta said.

ln the game Saturday, sophomore Russell Croft
led the Generals with three goals and two assiss.
Senior Colin Higgins also contributed three goals,
and senior goalie David Jones had 10 saves in his
first ever start. The Generals played well consid-
eringthey played without team leader Andy Dutton.

AWAY GAMES
BY STEPHEN WILLIARD

ln the spirit of Fancy Dress,
and the wonderful time that ev-
eryone is having (at least those
who don’t get arrested), 1 will
concentrate mostly on college
basketball this week.

While that might sound at first
like a random transition, con-
sider the facts. Soon after our
half-week of debauchery is
ended, every college basketball
conference in the land (except, of
course, the Pac Ten, who are just
weird) begins to play their con-
ference tournaments.

Both FD and college basket-
ball bring on wild celebrations. I
assure you that there were more
North Carolina students arrested
followingtheTime-out(Weber’s
blunder for the uninitiated) than
the worst FD your pitiful night-
mares can conjure up.

When was the last time some
crazed (insert favorite two or
three Greek letters here) threw
blue paint (pick a shade) all over
a helpless phone booth?

Also, both FD and college
basketball serve to remind us of
the wonderful upcoming spring
weather. March brings such
lovely weather to the Shenandoah
Valley every year.

In the same vein. the Final
Four always denotes the first
hurrah of spring at the end of the
dreary month of Mzfrch.

If I haven’t convinced you
thus far of the link between late
and post season college ball and
the wonderful world of FD, let

 

me give you one last compari-
son. The Duke-Carolina game
marks the true beginning of the
post season frenzy in the same
way as the Thursday night band
marks the beginning of FD (for
some). Following that is the At-
lantic Coast Conference touma-
ment, which, on a larger scale, is
comparable to the actual FD ball.
Finally, the NCAA tourna-
ment is a lot like the Saturday
night parties that close out FD.

Now, all the non-sports fans
who I told to read the column this
week can go back to their shel-
tered little worlds while I move
on to other topics, like the W&L
sidewalk skiing competition.

The candidate for game of the
week last week has to be the
Sweden—Canada Olympic ice
hockey game.

The Olympics, for all their
dreariness, managed to end on a
high note. The game went seven
shooters deep into the shoot-out
before Sweden won its first ever
hockey gold medal.

Back to college basketball,
for one score. The Duke Blue
Devils have overcome the loss of
All-America Bobby Hurley to
take the inside track for a number
one seed in the East Regional.

Now, only UNC and Mary-
land stand in their way. Duke
further secured their elite posi-
tion with their 88th consecutive
non-conference home victory
against the Temple Owls (just
for jollies, imagine how exciting
a Temple—Virginia basketball
game would be — like watching
paint dry.).

in the world of baseball (only
a month away, gliysl), the spring

Fancy Dress, March
Madness and Spring,

training speculation continues.
The Houston Astros, one of the
teams most affected by the in-
coming salary cap, have been
told that they can keep their ros-
ter intact to start the season.

The Astros have reason to give
thanks since they get to ﬁeld one‘:
of the strongest pitching staffs in J
the majors (second to Atlanta’s J
of course).

Parting Shots -

I just thought I would share t
with everyone the simple fact
that all should watch the Duke
vs. UNC basketball game.

Hats off to Oksana Bayul for
two reasons. First, she has an
incredible name. Second, she
proved to the world that there
were other country’s skaters
present at the games.

By the way, wasn’t there some

girl named Harding involved in ‘

the competition?

The Olympics have dedicated ‘

a new sport for the upcoming ’96
summer games: coach boxing.
Selected to take part in the trial
exhibition are John Chaney, John
Calipari, Buddy Ryan, and who-
ever that other Oilers coach was.

Fortunately forNASCAR, the
Daytona 500 is a thing of the
past. The good ole southern sport
isn’t doing too well lately.

There is something inherently
wrong with a sport that has people
making bets on who lives through
the season.

Finally, I leave everyone with
the wish for better weather, be-
cause it’s hard to play much of
anything in the way of sports
with mounds of freezing stuff
coming down around one’s head.
For cryingout loud, this is March!

A member of the W&L baseball team bats at the now-snow-covered Smith fiel

iBaseball suffers from snow’

Bv STEPHAN WJLLIARD
Phi Assistant Sports Editor

l
i Playing any sport can be made
I impossible by inclement weather
conditions, asthe Washington and
Lee baseball team found out this
‘ past week.

The Generalsenteredtheweek
with a 2-4-1 overall record and
have been stuck on that mark as
gameafter game has been snowed
out. Coach Mervin Stickly said
the layoff would not be as bad as
last year’s blizzard.

“We’re just going to try and
make them up. Last year it hit us
in conference games,” said
Stickley.

Prior to the layoff, the W&L
squad lost a twin bill to Mary
Washington. In the first game,
the Generals managed to scratch
out only one hit while Matt
Ermigotti and Rob Boston held

   

the Mary Washington offense to
just two unearned runs in the
game. In the second game, the
Generals committed five errors
as Mary Washington tallied 13
runs to defeat W&L 13-4.

According to coach Stickley,
the Generals are on target as far
as the season goes though,
“We’re certainly ahead of last
year. By the end of the season
we should be pretty good.”

The stars for the Generals so
far this season have been Bates
Brown on offense and Graig
Fantuzzi and Matt Ermigotti on
the mound. Brown has struck for
nine hits in his first 22 at bats
while Fantuzzi and Ermigotti
have both of W&L’s victories
and 11 strikeouts a piece.

Stickley said the team, “still
has some things to work out de-
fensively.”

Also, as a team, the Generals
are batting .180 on the season.

  

  

Stickley thinks that the team wil
improve as the season move
along, however, “we’re lookin,
at improving over last yea; an
improving this year.”

The Generals should be aide
by the return of junior co-captai,
Duane Van Arsdale. ‘

VanArsdaleplayedin hisfi »'
two games of the year again‘
Mary Washington after m'§sin
the first five games with a shou
der injury. Strikingly, one C
W&L’s most potent hitters thu
far has been pitcher Mat
Ermigotti with four hits in hi
first 13 at bats.

While W&L’s schedule p '
off due to the bad weather, th
team will have a chance to wor‘
out together and get used to eac
other. Having only one senior o
the team hurts in the area of e)
perience, but the only thing th: ‘'
will remedy that will be gam
experience.
