. etas face trial for marijuana charges

By ERIN LEONARD
Phi News Editor

Three of the four members of Beta Theta Pi
temity who were arrested for possession of
». rijuana in March went to trial in Rockbridge
un General District Court Monday.

Judge Joseph E. Hess found sufﬁcient evi-
nce to convict Andrew Suthard, ‘95, Garrett
u uldin, ‘96, and Christopher Buford, ‘96, but

did not.

Instead, Hess suspended each student’s
'ver’s license for six months, assigned them

attepd the Rockbridge County Alcohol and
bstance Abuse program and made them pay
urt costs in the amount of $196 each.

Hess took the case into advisement. A case

en into advisement is one in which no ver-

t is rendered but in which the defendant is

ordered to complete certain requirements by a
certain date.

On this date, what is called a dispositional
hearing is held. If the defendant has adhered to
the judge’s orders, the judge may drop all
charges.

The three students will appear before Hess
again on May 2, 1995.

None of the three were able to be reached for
comment.

Lexington Police also arrested Chris Murphy,
‘95, at the same time as Suthard, Bouldin and
Buford, but Murphy was not charged.

The arrests occurred when Sergeant Rick
Sutton was called to the Beta house early on a
Sunday morning to investigate a noise viola-
tion. The noise was coming from a stereo in
Buford’s room.

Police Chief Bruce Beard _said as Sutton
approached the room, he smelled marijuana

outside and inside the roorri. He found and
confiscated two bags of the substance.

Buford was evicted from his room at the
Beta house immediately, because he was in
violation of his room lease.

Former President Dana Arrighi said in an
earlier article, “It is his responsibility not to
have [marijuana] on the premises.”

Suthard and Bouldin were also living in the
house but were not evicted. Bouldin has since
moved to Woods Creek, but Suthard remains a
resident.

Beta President Jamie Cann said no decision
has been made yet regarding Suthard’s lease.
He said the Beta Judicial Committee, com-
posed of students, will meet next week and
make a recommendation to the Beta Housing
Corporation, composed of Beta alumni, during
an Alumni Meeting weekend.

“It could go either way,” said Carin.

The case is just one more in a year character-
ized by an unusually high number of cases
involving marijuana possession, Student Con-
duct Committee Chairman Reggie Aggarwal
said.

Aggarwal said he could not comment spe-
cifically on SCC cases but did say the commit-
tee held a hearing Tuesday in which four stu-
dents were found in violation of the university ’s
drug policy. The SCC put the students on con-
duct probation either until the end of spring
term or the end of next fall term. All four must
complete 25 hours of community service as
well.

Aggarwal stressed that, in making decisions
regarding punishment, the SCC takes into con-
sideration punishments by other governing bod-
ies that an accused student may be facing.

Aggarwal said the SCC has heard 13 cases
involving marijuana this year, and the number,

double that of previous years, disturbs him. He
said students are getting careless and are either
undaunted by or unaware of the penalties for
possession.

Possession of marijuana is a Class I
misdeamanor, a felony punishable by a maxi-
mum ﬁne of $2,500, a maximum of one year in
jail or a combination of the two.

Aggarwal said while SCC penalties are not
inconsequential, “SCC is slack compared to
what the judges can do to you.”

Aggarwal pointed out that a conviction in
the court system goes on a permanent record.
Convicted felons have a rap sheet, and every
time they apply to schools or for jobs, they have
to address the question of whether and why
they are a convicted felon.

Aggarwal urged students to consider before
they light a joint the consequences they face if
convicted.

S. court ruled VMI's all-male admissions policy will march on.

udge approves VWIL

By RICHARD WEAVER
PHI Associate Editor

It looks like Virginia Mili-
y Institute won’t go the co-
ucatiin route of Washington
d Lee.

. Over the weekend U.S. Dis-
ct Court Judge Jackson Kiser
led that the state-supported
Jtlitary school’s plan to estab-

ii a women’s military leader-
ip ptigram at Mary Baldwin
illege in Staunton would be

' ‘fﬁcient to allow VMI to re-
lin all male.

The establishment of the
..rginia Women’s Institute for
-adership (VWIL) at Mary
tldvqln College came about
;er t e 4th Circuit Court of
apeals ordered VMI to either
mit women, become a private
ititution, or create an alterna-
e that would be acceptable to
court.

VMI Superintendent, Major
neral John W. Knapp was
ased with the court’s ruling.

“We hope, that with this lat-

and deﬁnitive ruling from
~ U.S. court, VMI and Mary
ldwin can concentrate our
ort owardfulﬁllingouredu-
ional missions,” Knapp said

a written statement.

The court battle began in

* ' I when the U.S. Justice De-
ment ﬁled suit against VMI
gender discrimination.

In 1991 Judge Kiser afﬁrmed

I’? all-male admissions

policy. The Justice Department
appealed the decision, which re-
sulted in the circuit court’s call
for VMI to take action. The Jus-
tice Department has 60 days to
appeal the latestruling.

VWIL will be funded in part
by the private VMI Foundation.
The foundation has promised
$5.4 million to start the program,
as well as $500,000 for scholar-
ships, $500,000 for new equip-
ment at Mary Baldwin College
and $500,000 for planning.

MBC President Dr. Cynthia
Tyson was pleased with Judge
Kiser’s decision.

“This is an exciting day for
Mary Baldwin College; we are
making history... we are de-
lighted that the court has affirmed
our plans...” Tyson said in a
written statement.

In accepting the VWIL plan,
Kiser cited VMI’s willingness to
fulﬁll the “creative” option of
the circuit court’s choices. He
did not agree with the Justice
Department ’s contention that the
proposed VWIL differed with
VMI in a way that denied equal
education.

“I find that the differences
between VWIL and VMI are jus-
tiﬁed pedagogically and are not
based on stereotyping,” Kiser
wrote in his 28-page opinion.

“It is sufﬁcient that the com-
monwealth provide an all-female
program that will achieve sub-
stantially similar outcomes in an
all-female environment...”
Kiser wrote.

“We allowed for the possibil-
ity that a plan could still permit
VMI to remain a state-supported,
single-sex institution, if that were
the will of Virginia, so long as
women were offered a parallel
program. The order in VMI did
not, however, direct that any par-
allel program which the state
might choose to provide be iden-
tical for both men and women,”
Kiser wrote.

Recently the Virginia Gen-
eral Assembly approved equal
state ﬁnancial support for women
in the VWIL program compared
to in-state student aid given to
VMI cadets.

Knapp pledged to fully sup-
port the Kiser-approved plan.

“We at VMI are committed to
giving Dr. Tyson, Mary Baldwin
College, and the VWIL program
any assistance that may be re-
quested of us,” Knapp said.

VMI cadets were pleased with
Kiser’s decision as well.

Second—class Geoff Taylor
said most VMI cadets applied to
the school, because they wanted
to attend an all-male college.

Taylor said he thinks the op-
tion to choose between an all-
male, an all-female or a co-ed
corps will prove the best solution
to the problem. He said Virginia
Tech provides its students with a
co-ed ROTC corps, VMI pro-
vides an all-male corps and
VWIL will provide an all-fe-
male corps.

“That’s the best solution,”
Taylor said.

Smoking policy in works

By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Staff Writer

Smokers, beware. Your free-
dom to light up on campus may be
limited next year.

Dean of Students David
Howison will soon propose a for-
mal smoking policy to President
JohnWilson.

According to notices posted
around campus, the drafted smok-
ing policy would forbid smoking
in University public areas includ-
ing classrooms, computer rooms,
lounges, hallways and restrooms.
It would also make Evans Dining
Hall, the GHQ and the Co-op
smoke-free, as well as the gymna-
siums and locker rooms of cam-
pus athletic facilities.

Smoking would be permitted
in designated smoking areas such
as residence hall rooms, faculty
and administration offices, library
smoking lounges, or other areas
speciﬁcally designated by the ap-
propriate clean or director of the
facility.

Howison said in December of
1993, the Student Health Educa-
tion Committee voted unani-
mously to recommend a formal
policy. Howison said he had re-
ceived some complaints about
smoking from students and fac-
ulty.‘

“We had numerous individu-
als raising concerns about policy,
and the university didn’t have a
formal policy on smoking,” said
Howison.

Pat McDermott, a member of
the Student Health Education
Committee, said there were con-

After weeks of practice,
JubiLee members trekked to the
Lenfest Center early Sunday
morning, popped Luden’s cough
drops, gulped Diet Coke and be-
gan recording the group’s ﬁrst
tape.

Their only audience in the
Keller Theater was a microphone
and Gary Humiston, technical di-
rector for Lenfest. Still, the group
rocked back and forth on their feet
and swung their arms as if enthu-
siastic spectators were watching
them perfonn.

They sang an arrangement of

cems about students being ex-
posed to second-hand smoke,
which has been proven to be a
health hazard. He said there
could be a liability question in-
volved for the university.

“The university could be held
legally responsible for a student
contracting a disease [from sec-
ond-hand smoking],” said
McDermott.

He said bathrooms and hall-
ways were designated as non-
smoking areas in the proposed
policy, because it is impossible
for people to avoid the smoke in
these areas. He said the pro-
posal eliminates smoking in the
Co-op, because it has poor ven-
tilation. He said that the build-
ing is too small, and there is no
way of dividing space to avoid

the smoke.

Howison said the proposed
policy gives ﬂexibility to deans
and director to make decisions.

“We recognize that different
departments have different
needs,” he said, “and the policy
is reasonable.”

Howison said Dean of the
College John Elrod consulted
with the faculty on proposed
guidelines for the smoking
policy. Howison said he himself
has worked with Director of Per-
sonnel Bob Fox on the policy.

Howison said there will be an
Open Forum with students to dis-
cuss the smoking policy on May
10 at 4 p.m. in Payne 21.

The Student Health Educa-
tion Committee decided to rec-
ommend a proposal after a fall

survey in which students were
asked how they felt about smok-
ing on campus. McDermott said
a majority of students were in
favor of the smoking ban.

Survey comments com-
plained mostly about smoking in
the Co-op.

One female senior wrote, “I
never eat in the Co-op, because it
makes me smell.”

Another female senior wrote,
“The rules in the Co-op cater to
the inconsiderate smoking mi-

, pnority.”

Howison said he plans to sub-
mit the proposal to President
Wilson soon after the forum.

sponse to the proposed policy so

that one might forget JubiLee’s
music is strictly a cappella.

“A lot of times when we per-
form, [the visual aspect] is al-
most as important as what you
hear,” junior Melissa Wolf, the
group’s music director said. “On
a tape, people notice [cutoffs
and dynamnies], because there’s
nothing to look at. It’s all au-
dio.”

As a result, JubiLee had to
practice following Wolf’s vi-
sual cues for changes in the

group also had the option of
looking at sheet music during
the recording session.

“Wow, Friday the 13th,” said Smith.
“I guess that’s pretty wierd.”

Smith said the concert will be free to

The Wailers werecoming through the
area, and had an engagement at the Flood
Zone in Richmond May 12, so agreed to

Wolf said. “We had to go back
over it and make sure we had

because...there are several of us
that know more than one part.”
The singers rehearsed each
song at least once in the Keller

every take, they stood motion-
less, looking up at Humiston in

for a command from God.

Exposer sighted in Lexington agai I
police explore possibility of two me

By RICHARD WEAVER
Phi Staff Writer

One, or possibly two, men have tar-
geted Washington and Lee women to
expose themselves to, Lexington Police
Chief Bruce Beard said.

The most recent incident of expo-
sure occurred at 1 a.m. on April 20
when a man knocked on the front door
of a residential home on the 100 block
of Houston Street.

A female resident opened the door tow-

find the man masturbating. His pants

were around his ankles. The woman

closed the door, and the man then ran
away, Beard said.

The home is not occupied by stu-
dents but is next door to one that is.
Beard believes that the man intended to
expose himself to the students but
picked the wrong house.

A man was caught in the area shortly
afterwards. A check of his criminal
record revealed a history of sexual of-
fenses similar in nature to the incidents
reported in Lexington. However, wit-
nesses could not identify him as the
man who exposed himself, and he was

~ released. He remains a suspect in the

investigation, Beard said.

Beard believes the exposure on
Houston Street is related to three simi-
lar incidents on campus.

According to a letter from Dean of
Students David Howison which was
posted around campus, there were two
incidents on March 20 of a man expos-
ing himself.

Two women were jogging on the
Chessie Trail behind the Heating Plant
when a man exposed himself to them.
The same evening, a man exposed him-
self to a student on the fourth ﬂoor of
the library. .. . ~ *

JubiLee breaks new ground

“It’s nothing compared to the sound
you get when you have a professional
working [with you],” Smith said.

Senior Jennifer Ray agreed.

“The whole thing has sounded pro-
fessional and [has been] efficient.

The tape will include songs such as
“Shenandoah,” Bonnie Raitt’s “Some-
thing to Talk About,” Madonna’s
“Rain,” the Beatles’s “O-Bla-Di” and
“The Tide is High” by Blondie. JubiLee
chose these tunes, in addition to “Tux-
edo Junction” and “Georgia on My
Mind,” because they represent the
group’s most performed songs. The
group also selected them with a particu-
lar audience in mind.

“We’re hoping that the alumni and
admissions department are going to buy
some tapes from us,” Smith said. “We

picked those audiences, because we felt
' like we were going to sell more there
‘ than we actually would on campus.”

Smith said the enthusiasm of such
audiences makes live performing more
interesting than recording.

“Since a lot of it is for alumni, it’s
really exciting and rewarding to sing for
something that helps the school,” she
said.

Smith said she remembers the thrill
of singing for the Five-Star Generals
last year during Alumni Weekend at
Lexington Country Club.

“I don’t think we’ve ever sung for a
group of people that were more excited
to hear us...clapping, videotaping us,”
she said.

“You could sort of imagine yourself
there 50 years later and how excited you
would be. I’m definitely looking for-
ward to doing that again.”

And the whole group is looking for-
ward to profits from the tape.

A lack of money is one reason why
JubiLee has never recorded a tape be-
fore this year, but they have scraped

money from different singing events to
fund their tape.

“The tape is something the seniors
really wanted to do before they left,”
senior Meriwether Nichols said.

Nichols agreed that the senior mem-
bers of Jubilee had pushed for the
recording session.

“I’d like to sing after college. I’d
like to sing a cappella again,” she said.

“But the tape...for me, it’s going to be
a memento.”

JubiLee will take orders for the five-
dollar cassette beginning Alumni
Weekend. They will be delivered over
the summer.

The group will give their final per-
formance for the year on during Alumni
Weekend in Lee Chapel. They will
perform with Southern Comfort.

As for now, Howison said, Evans Dining Hall and the

I vegetarianism the key to P.C. in the 90s?
Rising health consciousness has led many to
give up their carnivorous diets. Others, in-
spired by environmental concerns have also
taken the meat-less route.

Vegetarians come in many different shapes
and sizes, and rarely fall under any traditional
defgitions. The only standard one must meet
to assume the title of “vegetarian” is to give up
meat in some form.

Vegans are the most extreme of vegetarians.
o me eastern religions, especially Hindu sects,
promote veganism. Vegans eat nothing that
» mes from an animal, ﬁsh or bird, including
e and other dairy products.
ere are thousands of less extreme kinds of
vegetarians. The more common of these are
those that eat no read meat but eat fish and foul,
or those that eat no meat whatsoever but still eat
dairy products.

Vegetarians’ motives often vary as much as
the evels of their not eating animal products.
Mo frequently they cite moral reasons, such
as the opposition to the killing of animals under
any circumstances. Some don’t oppose the
predator-prey relationship but say they are boy-
cotting the practices used by the meat products
industry. Others cite ecological or economic
reasons for their practice. Books such as Carol
Adaﬁrs’ The Sexual Politics ofMeat and Peter
Singer’s Animal Liberation explain many of
these motives. .

Deborah Zollmann, a freshman at W&L,
said she is a vegetarian because it’s healthier.

“I like animals and
I don’t like to kill
them. I also don’t
want to destroy the
tropical rain forests by
grazing cattle on
them.”

Zollmann has been
a vegetarian for four
years.

Scientists have
cited many conﬂict-
ing ﬁgures over time
concerning the effects
of a meat-eating soci-
ety on the environ-
ment and the world
economy. In many
climates, on one acre
of fertile land, one
could grow a high-

Many green veg-

“I like pasta bar,” she said.

At the Co-op, the vegetarian can rely on
such staples as grilled-cheese sandwiches and
bagels, mufﬁns and french fries. Fast food
dining often presents a challenge to the vegetar-
ian because most such restaurants focus their
menus around either the burger, the chicken-
sandwich, or the taco.

There are several cookbooks full of only
vegetarian recipes. Many of these include
ethnic foods or foods adapted to vegetarians by
the substitution of soy proteins for meat. Edith
Brown’s Cooking Creatively With Natural
Foods and Frances Moore Lappe’s Diet Fora
Small Planet are both available from Leybum
Library.

While vegetarianism may be a lifestyle
adopted recently by many famous ﬁgures, for
others it is only a trend that involves an
untraditional sacrifice.

peas or beans, producing between 300 and 500
pounds of protein-rich food. Plant foods on
average yield about 10 times as much food per
acre as meat does. Not all land is conducive to
such high protein crops as peas, however. Fur-
thermore, cattle—food crops require less man-
power than peas and beans. In sparsely popu-
lated rural areas, it would be difﬁcult for farrn-
ers to grow anything but cattle-feed.

Other ﬁgures used to promote vegetarian-
ism are as follows: a pound of meat requires 50
times as much water as an equivalent quantity
of wheat; in drought stricken areas such as
Texas and Oklahoma, the care of cattle often
intensiﬁes the lack of water; ﬁshing trawlers
damage the fragile ecology of the sea bed and
use up more energy (fossil fuels) than they

Few of the ﬁgures are veriﬁed, and many of
them represent only speciﬁc situations. Au-
thorities on the meat industry have noted many
changes over the years, since Upton Sinclair’s
The Jungle revealed many of the unappetizing
practices. Many of the new texts focus not only
the quality of the meat, but on the quality of life
of the animals sent to slaughter. One’s sensitiv-
ity to these matters is often a function of up-
bringing and one’s perception of the role of
animals on earth.

By MICHAEL HEWLEIT
Phi Staff Writer

In the midst of the recent contro-
erg over Khalid Muhammad’s anti-
Semitic statements at Kent State Uni-
versity and Howard University, it be-
comes increasingly apparent that race
does matter. In Race Matters, Come]
West, one of today’s leading black
intellectuals and currently professor of
Afr0American Studies and the Phi-
losophy of Religion at Harvard Uni-
versity, combines intellect and righ-
eousness in his discussion of a number
f topics dealing with race: “Plato’s
profound ——- yet unpersuasive — cri-
tique of Athenian democracy as inevi-
tabljpcorrupted by the ignorance and
passions of the masses posed one chal-
lenge, and Du Bois’s deep analysis of
the intransigence of white supremacy
in the American democratic experi-
ment posed another.” Invariably, West
is able to construct a conversation that
stimnlates the mind while at the same
time stirring the emotions.

The most poignant parts of the book
are those that deal with black nihilism,
the crisis of black leadership, black-
Jewish relations and the controversial
subject of black sexuality. He links
- lack nihilism with the corporate mar-
et. He argues that materialism causes
frightening hopelessness in black
erica and an undermining of tradi-
tional morals in American society in
eneral, which often surfaces in dis-
1. urbing violence in the inner-city. He
u ests some of the causes of black
" ihi sm may not all lie in social and
‘--. litical inequality but rather in a loss
of spiritual validity. Market institu-

C_orneI West discourses

tions “have helped cre-
ate a seductive way of
life, a culture of con-
sumption that capital-
izes on every opportu-
nity to make money...it
is clear that corporate
marketinstitutionshave
greatly contributed to
underminingtraditional
morality in order to stay
in business and make a
proﬁt.” West also cre-
ates a middle ground
when discussing the
crisis of black leader-
ship. He wants to de-
velop a discussion of
the issues irrespective
of party ideologies. He
putsforthsuccinctlythe
problemsandvirtuesof
both black liberalism
and conserv_atism. Al-
though he concedes
black conservatives rightly perceive
that racism is not the sole cause of
black people’s plight, he notes that
“most black people conclude that while
racial discrimination is not the sole
cause of their plight, it certainly is one
cause.” He cites this as one of the
reason why black conservatism has not
made an impasse into the black com-
munity.

Throughout the book, West tries to
see the issues from both points of view
and synthesizes them into a frequently
persuasive conclusion.

Some of his conclusions, speciﬁ-
cally about afﬁrmative action, do fall
ﬂat.

The idea of a class-based affirma-
tive action sees specious on today’s
political climate, but his critique of this

Baldwin’: early essays.”
—Wash(nglon Pas! Book World

racially charged issue brings together
in a coherent manner the virtues and
flaws of the system.

Whether one agrees with West or
not, he brings a reasoned and calm
voice to the conversation on race rela-
tions—a conversation too often marked
by emotionalism on both sides. He
seeks to bring the dialogue to another
level.

“We simply cannot enter the twenty-
first century at each other’s throats,
even as we acknowledge the weighty
forces of racism, patriarchy, economic
inequality, homophobia, and ecologi-
cal abuse on our necks. We are at a
crucial crossroad in the history of this
nation——-and we either hang together
by combating these forces that divide
and degrade us or we hang separately.”

 

Have you ever heard of the great
band by the name of Live ? It’s a name
that contributes to its share of confu-
sion, especially when one goes to see
them “live.” Anyway, this band, which

hails from the hallowed grounds of ;

York, PA has ﬁnally come up with its
follow-up to their ﬁrst album, “Mental
Jewelry.” It’s been about three years
since this release so Live fans have
been waiting a while for some new
songs from this band.
This second album goes
by the name “Throwing
Copper” and is well
worth the money.

Live is a band that is
known for its soft intro-
ductions that gradually
crescendo to a beat that
leaves its audience in
shreds. This album is
certainly no exception.
The song “t.b.d” epito-
mizes the Live style of
playing. It opens with a
great bass part and fan-
tastic vocals by the lead
singer, Ed Kowalczyk.
This is one of those
songs that you play re-
ally loud to hear the in-
tricate melodies only to
later be surprised by the
thunderous uproar that
results.

The ﬁrst single that
has been released off the
album, perhaps you’ve
heard it on WLUR,

“Selling the Drama,” is by no means
the best. While it’s got a good melody
and leaves you singing afterwards, it
doesn’t have the typical Live emotion
and enthusiasm. It is also unusually
foggy lyrically, but maybe that’s just
due to the deﬁciencies of the listener.

Live is a powerful band and" its
power, usually, comes from its lyrics.
The last song on the album, “White,
Discussion,” is very intriguing,

I talk of freedom

you talk of the flag

I talktof‘.r§V0l\ati0.n~; :: ;. . .. .

you’d much'rather‘brag

and as the decibels of this disen-
chanting

discourse continue to dampen the
day

The rain ﬂips again and again and

again

and again as our sanity walks away.

Another song that is musically
strong is one that you will not be hear-
ing on WLUR due to its title. “S**t
Towne” is a song the band members
reportedly wrote about their hometown,
York, Pa.

Of course, this may very well be a
vicious rumor. Regardless, this song
describes the characters one usually
sees in a town that, although small, has
been touched by its share of crime and

It also treats the frustration of the
citizens who cannot escape from its
arms.

Live has had its share of difﬁculties.
After missing its album art deadline the
release of its second album was de-
layed by almost two
months. Then their
tour in support of
the album had to be
delayed because the
bass player, Patrick
Dahlheimer, was
stricken with ap-
pendicitis.

In comparison,I
believe that this sec-
ond album is tre-
mendously better
than the ﬁrst.

The sound is
richer, fuller, and
even more emo-
tional.

I sincerely sug-
gest that you check
this album out.

And if you’ve
never heard of the
band, but like some
really great rock
music, trust me, you
won’t be disap-
pointed.

Phi Movie Reviewer

The Paper — ﬁﬁﬁ

The Paper is a very confused and troubled movie— Dr.
Wdth is deﬁnitely needed here.

It has been marketed as something between a comedy
and drama (tragicomedy?), and this line-walking proves to
be one of the ﬁlm’s chief faults.

It revolves around a hectic-as-usual day at a New York
tabloid, the Sun, and the case of the moment, the wrongful
accusation of two black youths over a mob-related slaying.

We are given a host of characters to follow, primarily
Michael Keaton; along for the ride are Glenn Close as the
managing editor; Robert Duvall, the aging l’ve-got-pros-
tate-cancer chief editor; and Randy Quaid, a goofy ‘70s-
leftover columnist (he wears a cool corduroy jacket through-
out .

I)t’s also the type of movie where you say, “Hey, isn’t that
theguy from...?” For example, George from Seinfeld is the
disgraced trafﬁc commissioner and the black female chief
from Where in the World is Carmen San Diego is Keaton’s
secretary.

There are also about a million cameo appearances, from
Eric Bobsian and Kurt Loder to Bob Costas. (I think Kevin
Bacon was in there; if you saw him, call me).

Q

The Paper suffers

Basically, it is difficult for this movie to be tragedy or
comedy or anything because it virtually has no plot.

Some might argue that The Paper is meant to be simply
a slice of life piece, merely a day-in-the-life. After all, do our
days have plots?

Well, no, but this is also a movie we will go to see, so it
should be more interesting and engrossing than my life is
now, or else why would I pay money for it?

There are a number of conflicts at work, mostly revolv-
ing around the next day’s lead story and headline. That
theme is explored, but not enough.

Rather, the script touches on a number of problems:
conﬂict between Close and Keaton, between Keaton and his
wife, between Duvall and his daughter, between Close and
the paper’s owner (Jason Robards), between Keaton and his
future, etc., etc. We are given some of a young photographer’s
troubles, some of the trafﬁc commissioner’s problems, a
few moments in the life of the wrongly accused suspects,
some of this, some of that, some of everything, it seems.

Perhaps, though, this movie will be saved by its cast,
which is as full of stars as a planetarium. But it’s not.

Michael Keaton is the exact same character he is in every
movie he has ever made: the lovable class clown. Whether
he’s Beetlejuice, Batman or Mr. Mom, we always see the
same kiddish mannerism and facial expressions, the same
big heart which opens up in time of troubles.

His whole attempt at making his character stressed fails;
instead, he is comedically rushed, as if from the Spencer
Tracy movie It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. Just like
the rest of the movie, his character is caught between

from lack of plot

comedy and drama.

In fact, all the characters are lost in this way. Glenn
Close’s pathetically inane fight scenes are truly mystifying;
why would anyone script Sunny von Bulow slipping on a
banana peel?

Robert Duvall is a very mundane “old man;” his attempts
at reconciliation with his daughter are completely fake and
wouldn’t bring a tear to the eye of the most sentimental of
mothers.

At any rate, the various smaller roles are generally better
ﬁlled than the large, star roles, and it is in those lesser roles
that the acting of this movie is redeemed.

But The Paper isn't destroyed completely; it still has its
good moments.

Ron Howard’s directing is surprisingly good. Most of
the scenes are very well shot, such as the conversation
between Keaton and Duvall on the roof of the building. He
only rarely succumbs to that tendency of directors to over-
shoot (q.v. the telephones in the hospital hallway), and the
scenes are generally carried along quite briskly.

Also coming to the rescue here is the subject matter. The
world of a major daily paper is tense, stressful and nail-
biting.

The habit of deadlines and the pressure to sell papers
keeps the characters on their toes throughout. They don’t
have the time to slow down, and so they pull the movie along
with them on their daily roller coaster.

Essentially, this movie has a weak script and a generally
ineffective performance from the cast; however, the brisk
job done by Ron Howard in the inherently fast-paced world

of a daily tabloid keep ourinterest and rescue the ﬁlm from
complete schizophrenia.

The result is a movie which is not too bad, but it’s also not
the kind you drive to Roanoke to see. I give it three stars: if
you’re going to see it, wait for video, and be sure to split the
cost with a few fraternity brothers. «

The Rating Scale

ﬁﬁrfrﬁﬁ — Go buy this as soon as it comes out on
video. It is an instant classic. “You'll laugh; you'll cry;
and maybe, just maybe, you'll learn something about
yourself."

ﬁikﬁfr — Go see this ﬁlm now, while it's still on the
big screen. It's worth a few Oscars and the seven bucks
you'll pay if you see it outside Lexington. Overall,
“Better than Cats!”

rkiihik — Okay, so there have been better ﬁlms.
Nevertheless, it is a good example of its genre, and you
should probably see it on videotape, especially if you are
a fan of the actors or director. Still, probably “Better than
Cats!”

skit’ —— It happens to be on HBO, and you're blowing
off tomorrow's reading. Although your time would
probably be better served on your education, it's free and
you're bored, so go ahead and watch it.

1% — Even if it's free and your best friend said he never
laughed harder, trust me, this one sucks. Don't waste your
time, or at least don't waste it on this. (There's always
MTV.)

Ella: ‘ﬂing-mm lﬂlti

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

A Dean of Fun?

Since when have we as mature men and women become

so incapable that we need someone to help us have a good time?
The Dean of Students’ ofﬁce seems to think its students are not
having a good enough time here at one of the most socially
oriented schools in the nation.

The Washington and Lee University administration
recently decided to hire an outside director for the Student
Activities Board.

Not only does this create more administration, but the
14 grand or so the person will be paid could definately be used
in many other areas around the university. Surely the dozen or
so department heads could think of something to do with 1000
dollars each.

Although we Ring-tum Phi staffers do not get out as
often as we would like (we are up here slaving away so you can
read this), when we do get out and about Lexington, there is no
shortage of A) Fun or B) People having fun.

And there are now TWO newspapers innundating the
student body with things they can do with their Wednesdays,
Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays and
Tuesdays. There should be no shortage of things do in or
around Lexington.

Besides that, I should hope we are all intelligent enough
to fend for ourselves, which we will have to eventually do
anyway when we hopefully graduate and move on with our
lives. The administration should also keep in mind that around
60 to 70 percent of the campus already has some sort of social
life planned for them and will not be needing this dean.

This latest brain cloud to come out of the Dean of
Students office is yet another example of the administration
wanting to be just like every other liberal arts school in the top
25 of the U. S. News and World Report, so we can rise in the
rankings.

The “Dean of Fun” as one history professor called the
future administrator, is not needed at Washington and Lee. We
are not every other liberal arts college and we should not try

to be.

Coordinator needed, but basics first

Last week the Dean of Student’s office
announced its intention to hire a full-time Student

Activities Coordinator.

dous possibilities but must be carefully constructed so

that it may meet up to its
potential. The concept of a

community who wish to ex-
plore life at W&L as an in-

 

dependent. However, we
also need to realize the po-

tential for this position to become more
-comprehensive in dealing with all aspects of

student activities.

There is no doubt that this campus is in need of a
professional who can coordinate activities, speciﬁ-
cally those activities that are non-alcohol and non-
greek or not speciﬁcally afﬁliated with a greek orga-
nization. However, it is imperative that this new
position be filled with an individual who also realizes
that a key element of all student activities is health.
While I am thrilled that this position is being estab-
lished, I am disappointed that it is being funded while

other important initiatives are not.

For example, the position of Campus Health Edu-
cator has been ﬁlled for the past few years by Jan
Kaufman, M.P.H. Despite the fact that our campus
health statistics warrant the addition of a team of
health educators to deal with our health problems, the
position remains only part-time. This is entirely inad-
equate and the Dean of Students knows it. Addition-
ally, while the need for a Student Center, where
independents and greeks can meet and experience a
social atmosphere that does not center around alcohol
is clear, the starting date for construction of this
building is not. Improvements in the Health Center, a
new Counseling Center, and expanded health educa-
tion programming in general are all desperately needed,

as well.

Pleasure: some seek it as if it were
the Holy Grail; others condemn it, tak-
ing all precautions to alleviate them-
selves from it. This is not new, plea-

include work with these is-
sues. Quite honestly, if the
Dean of Students intends this
person to spend time simply

managing student event schedules, no one will ben-
eﬁt. Students at this university do not need another

low level manager, we need leadership and energy to

help us initiate some
programs that could
entire campus.

One such idea is that
of renovating the old train
station and turning it into
a “coffeehouse” where
students could meet. The
coffeehouse would have
pool tables, video games,
occasional bands and
other performers, and
snacks. This would be an
invaluable investment in
the student body of the
university, particularly
those who are not in so-
cial organizations and/or
those who choose not to
drink. Both of these
groups are slowly tying

culprit are those looking toward our
best interest, people like Hillary Clinton
and her health task force.

In older days the sins of pleasure
which were denounced were those such
as pre-marital sex, and its result, chil-
dren out of wedlock. Today, though,
the former activity is considered nor-
mal, the latter, applauded (see: Murphy
Brown). I don’t wish to opinion on
which of the preceding I approve of,
only to indicate that these attitudes
exist. Which activities then are to
blame for the miserable plight of hu-
man existence?

According to the president’s wife,
anyone who eats hamburgers and
French fries, and smokes an occasional
cigar is guilty of grievances far sur-
passing those of communist Russia . . .

that people who smoke will require
more health care and thus should pay
more.

Using this same justiﬁcation, those
of us who eat beef should pay more, or
those of us who drink the occasional
beer should pay more. This and other
such excise taxes do us, the consumers
and thus the tax payers, little good and
further government intrusiveness into
our lives.

Now just hold on those of you who
don’t indulge in the above pleasures
who are thinking that these taxes aren’t
such a bad idea, think about the things
you enjoy which are bad for you; a bag
of potato chips, a steak dinner, should
people who work in front of a com-
puter be taxed at a higher rate because
they have a high chance of getting a
brain tumor? The answer is no; these

of the excellent ideas and
be made available to the

ideas like the coffeehouse would help to alleviate it.

What one ﬁnds when examining the social struc-
ture here is that almost every facet of W&L student
activities is tied to several different health issues.
Those people in positions of power, the people who
will hire the new staff member need to realize this.
They should employ a professional who will be able
to adjust and to meet Washington and Lee’s unique
set of needs. We at W&L are truly approaching a
crossroads, not just in Student Health but in Student
Life, in general. In some areas we continue to excel, ,
and we approach this crossroads with anticipagon.
Our academic standards continue to rise and our
endowment is being brought to a more secure level.
The continuation of these strengths is something
that we all look forward to. But there are also
shortcomings that must be addressed.

As I have pointed out before, we are facing

to expand at W&L, but they ﬁnd heavy resistance
from a system that has been in place for too long.
Those who choose to “buck” the social norms here
often ﬁnd themselves ostracized from any form of

serious situations in dealing with alcohol on cam-

are the risks we take with the liberty
God has given us, we drive in cars and
take airplanes and even cross the street
. . . by doing any of these things we
assume a certain amount of risk.

This trend is even occurring here at
Washington and Lee. For example, the
recently enacted smoking ban in cam-
pus eateries despite the strong student
protest against it.

Not to beat a dead horse, but the
current ban

the rest of the Dean of Students staff have the ability

Pos’ SPACE
' Tom Hespos

Here we go again.

Earlier this week, Spos’ corruption
ensors started going off when he
iassed Payne Hall on his way back
ro a class. Further investigation
inpointed the source of the distur-
ance somewhere in Dean McCloud’s
ffrce. I’ll tell you why.

Right outside the Dean on Students’
ffice, there is posted a memorandum
'rom Dean Howison, dean of students
nd bocce commissioner. The memo
escﬁbes the purpose of the Student
aculty Hearing Board. According to
he memo, the SFHB has heard several
ases, including one case involving
acial harrassment, one involving an
ffensive phone message, and one in-
olving an offensive poem. Granted,
s pogloes not know exactly what hap-
re ned with regard to these cases, but
ells are going off in Spos’ head, much
kin to Spiderman’s “Spider Sense.”
I referred to my trusty copy of the
1994-95 Washington and Lee Catalog
or the lowdown.

“She Student-Faculty Hearing
:oard is authorized to hear and adjudi-
- ate allegations of sexual misconduct
'nvolving Washington and Lee stu-
- ents,” stated the catalog.

Okay — nothing wrong with this
policy. As Spos understands it, this is
the reason why the SFHB was set
up: to deal with the problem of
sexual misconduct.

So what the hell is this stuff
about racial discrimination and
offensive poems?

Methinks the
corruptions sen-
sors do not lie.
Please, Dean
McCloud, correct
me if I’m wrong,

Perhaps Spos is being a little too
paranoid about such trivial matters.
But you know how it is with these silly
three and four-letter committees. You
give them an
inch, and they
takeayard. If we
start letting the
SFHB go beyond
the realm of
sexual miscon-
duct, we will be
inviting a whole
mess of trouble.

To the editor:

Oh behalf of the Class of 1994 Se-
nior Pledge Project, we would like to
take this opportunity to respond to Tom
Hespos’ letter which appeared in the
April 29 Ring-tum Phi.

We would also like to reiterate
the critical points of the pledge

proﬁct program.

tuition was made affordable to our par-
ents and each of us is because of alumni
enerosity to the Annual Fund.

In fact, both the University and its
' lumni contributed about $8,000 per
M ersyn to tuition each year for the past
our years. Thought of anotherway,
' ver the past four years our tuition
harges have been reduced by $32,000!

We realize the primary reason our A

The Annual Fund consists of unre-
stricted gifts to the University, which
means the funds are not used for spe-
cifrc scholarships, budgets or build-
ings, but for the operating budget.

Like tuition, the operating budget
pays for faculty salaries, library and
laboratory equipment, and other essen-
tial day-to-day costs.

The spring pledge project allows
seniors to speak personally with a vol-
unteer about the Annual Fund. Since
its creation in 1990, the pledge project
provides seniors an opportunity to
“bridge the gap” into alumni years,
with an understanding of how private
educations are funded.

Kevin Webb shrugged when asked what
effect this sentence would have on
student autonomy.

My message to Dean McCloud is
the following: stick to cases of sexual
misconduct.

Anythingelseoughttobe handled
by the Student Conduct Committee or
the Executive Committee.

In other news, Spos has decided to
bestow his annual Freedom Prize for
Model Partying/Literary Award to the
members of Sigma Nu fraternity for
their excellent effort at Shipwreck this
past weekend. The Sigma Nu brothers
showed overriding concern for provid-
ing an environment in which it was not
possible to not have fun. Guys, please
send a representative to 106 Lee Av-
enue to pick up the award.

Also, the curse of 1,001 smelly gym
socks has been uttered and placed on
the unknown individual who nearly
took Spos’ head off with a ﬂying roast
beef sandwich this weekend at Foxﬁeld.
Good luck getting a date next year. The
curse is permanent and should be tak-
ing effect sometime soon. Heh-heh.

Two weeks from now, Spos will
present his final. column before he
graduates and migrates northward in
search of money, cheap pleasures, and
safe haven from the evil forces of the
SFHB. Until then, barrage the admin-
istration with nasty complaint letters.
Long live the resistance!

In addition to the obvious academic
benefits, we believe our efforts will
allow future generations of W&L stu-
dents to experience springtime
at Goshen and the sunset from

Finally, we realize as much as our
classmates the financial pressures the
class of 1994 will face.

TALKBACK

 

The Senior Pledge Project is con-
ducted by senior volunteers who con-
tact their classmates to ask for pledges
to next year’s Annual Fund.

No money is collected now. The
first Annual Fund year in which the
Class of 1994 would participate as
alumni begins July 1, 1994 and runs
through June 30, 1995.

We hope this letter conveys the
committee’s enthusiasm for this project,
and our belief that a small sacrifice on
behalf of W&L is a worthy investment
in the future of our alma mater.

Thank you.

Huntley clariﬁes his
statement on Peck

To the editor:

I would like to correct an impres-
sion which may have been raised by
the article on Professor Peck in the
April 22 edition.

In the article I am quoted as being
troubled by the principle of confidenti-
ality, most particularly when it con-
ﬂicts with the principle of accountabil-

ity-.And1_h§Q“.01ﬁ.l§:$Ub5§3miV¢lY,9Ql'7«

=rect — in this respect.

Unfortunately my. statement was
juxtaposed to Professor Craun’s un-
willingness “to discuss the contents of
the Peck letter,” something is forbid-
den to do by law. _

Only Professor Peck has a legal

right to do this.

My worry about the accountability-
confidentiality relates to the question
of whether or not a given professor
may explain how and why he or she
voted on ay given issue, if asked.

Juxtaposing my general concerns
about confidentiality with Professor
Craun’s unwillingness to release the

,spec,ifi_cs__olf‘_this particular letter, an
illegal act, as I say, creates the impres-

,:=,§ion Ivwouldthave favored its release.

This is simply untrue. No more than he
do I wish to end up in the pokey.

Hockey news from the edge

By TORY Noro AND JAsoN

Well, it’s 12:15 am and this article
was supposed to be written a few hours
ago. Before the editor lynches me, I
just wanted to say that I wanted to get
the most up-to-date hockey scores for
the loyal hockey fans of Washington
and Lee.

First for the local team. The Wash-
ington Capitals are getting whipped by
the Rangers. Tonight the score was a
merciful 3-0. Unfortunately, the Caps
will have to do better than cheap shot.

My fellow fan, The Ever Womiy
Teeters, is a fan of some of our neigh-
bors to the North, the Vancouver
Canucks (ever since the Flyers were
pummeled in the first round).

According to him, Pavel Bure is the
greatest player to skate (after the Great
One and the Gord). Perhaps he is right.

the Russian Rocket (Bure) take them
all the way??? Of course! They are
facing DALLAS?!

DALLAS!!! Everything in Texas
hurts....especially hockey teams, even
though they did beat the Blues.

Sadly there are two “Southern”
teams in the conference semi-finals of
a Northern sport. The other team is the
bandwagon San Jose Sharks.

They were an eight seed and beat
the first seeded Red Wings (“Everyone
plays their best against the Red
Wings”).

Now they ’re tied against the Toronto
Maple Leafs, an experienced‘ playoff
team led by Doug Gilmour.

Of course I saved the best for last.
The NEW JERSEY DEVILS had the
most exciting game of the first round
against the Buffalo Sabres. Four
overtimes!!! Even though they lost
that battle, they won the war.

Now the Devs are up against the

The Devs managed to tie the Bruins
in game two with three seconds left in
the game, but still lost in overtime.

Tonight the Devs defeated the Bru-
ins to bring the series to 2 games to 1.
Don’t worry though. W&L will be
graced once more with my jersey
(which a close friend of mine wanted to
burn more than anything else in this
life or the next one) very soon.

Lemieux, Stevens, Terreri, and
Semak will pull through. How can this
team lose? They have a guy named
Valeri Zelepukin!

Well, time to get this article in.
Before I go, at the risk of rousing the
spirit of General Lee with some North-
ern pride, most of the Southerners that
I know think that ice comes in little
cubes and is used in your favorite bev-
erages.

But there is hope! Get out and go
see the Roanoke Express. Minor league
hockey isn’t too bad.

- e Tennis gets NCAA berth

s  W&L’s women’s tennis team set a newschool record for  this year .21p_n.their way. ; ._

By Stephen Williard
Phi Sports Editor

There is such a thing as success, and
then there is such a thing as phenom-
enal achievement.

The accomplishments of the Wash-
ington and Lee women’s tennis team
clearly fall into the latter category.

The dust had not even settled from
a blemish-free 21-0 season, complete
with an Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference championship, when the W&L
squad received notice that they were
invited to the big show.

The invitation marks the first time
since 1991 that the Generals have re-
ceived a ticket to the NCAA’s as a
team.

Senior Captain Kim Dickinson is
the only player remaining who was on
that team.

For the season, the squad posted
numerous milestones. In the ODAC

championships, all six singles titles Senior captain Kim Dickinson will

went to W&L players.

The Generals also boast three 20
match singles winners with junior
Marilyn Baker, sophomore Julie Ayers,
and Anna O’Connor.

Head coach Cinda Rankin credited
the team’s immense success to the abil-
ity to focus on each match.

“Every time we had a match, we
focused on that match,” said Rankin.

Also qualifying as individuals for
the Generals were Baker and Ayers.

Baker enters the tournament ranked
second in Division III while Ayers
stands at 33. The two are ranked 11th
together in the doubles competition.

Coach Rankin was quick to praise
her athletes.

“I have a terrific group of kids to
work with,” she said. “They work
hard.”

Adding to the team’s mystique is
the fact that only one player is lost to
graduation.

be the only departing member of the
formidable squad.

According to Rankin, the already
deep squad also includes two freshmen
who have a shot at breaking into the top
six next year.

Despite the team’s success, Rankin
is approaching the tournament cau-
tiously.

“When you get down to a tourna-
ment like this, it comes down to mental
toughness,” she said. “Everybody
who’s there has a shot at winning it.”

Despite her caution, the W&Lcoach
is optimistic about the team’s chances
in Michigan.

“Skillwise we’re every bit as tal-
ented as anybody else,” said the coach.

However, Rankin continued to
maintain the importance of taking the
tournament one match at a time.

“If you start to look too far ahead,
you can stumble,” she said, “and there ’s
no room to stumble here.”

Washington & Lee’s lacrosse
reign ended last Saturday with a
semiﬁnal loss in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference Touma-
ment.

The Generals were defeated
by Lynchburg College for the
second time this season, falling
12-6 in Lynchburg.

Earlier this season, the Hor-
nets fought off a late W&L rally
to beat the Generals 12-11 at the
Liberty Hall Fields.

Washington & Lee ﬁnishes
the season 8-7 overall, their ﬁrst
season with fewer than ten wins
since 1989. Four of the losses
were by only one goal.

The Generals and Hornets
traded a pair of goals in the early
going and were knotted at two.
However, the Hornets opened the
ﬂoodgates and scored the next
six goals to take command of the
game.

Although W&L would climb
within 8-5, they were already de-
moralized and essentially out of
the game at that point.

Goalie Sarah Smith said the
team felt as if they might as well
have not been on the ﬁeld fol-
lowing the six goal run by the

S

Lynchburg team.

“It was hard to be motivated,”
said Smith, who stopped 13 shots
in the loss.

Lynchburg, who ultimately
lost the championship game to
Roanoke, had a similar start to
the ﬁrst meeting with the Gener-
als.

W&L managed a strong sec-
ond half, though, and cut a late
12-7 deﬁcit down to 12-11 be-
fore time expired. This time, the
Generals could not ﬁght back
into it.

“We had moments of good
play, but it was too late,” said
Smith, one of three seniors on the
team that played their last game
Saturday. Tri-captains Angie
Carrington, Pauline Mita, and
Smith end their W&L careers
with a 44-19 record and two
ODAC championships.

Junior Lindsay Coleman
scored three times versus
Lynchburg and finished the sea-
son as the team’s scoring leader
with 47 points on 35 goals and 12
assists.

She placed one point ahead of
Carrington, who ranks third on
theschool’sall-timelistsforgoals
(110), assists (30), and points
(140). She ﬁnishes behind Lisa
Dowling ‘93 and Kim Bishop
‘92 in all three categories.

The Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse team responded to its early season
critics by coming back to win the ODAC championship and narrowly miss a
berth in the NCAA tournament.

Women’s Lax Slips

Junior Nicole Ripken (19
goals, 6 assists) placed third on
the team in scoring despite play-
ing just nine games. She and
Coleman are tied for fourth on
W&L’s career goals list with 79.

Freshman Erika Snyder was
the top frosh scorer with 16 goals
and six assists and is one of the
many ﬁrst-year players that give
Smith reason to feel the season
was a successful one for a team
that is only going to get better.

“It was a good season,” she
said. “We had so many freshmen
playing impact positions and we
had a winning record.”

Still, W&Lwill certainly miss
the three captains. Smith retires
with 288 career saves, second in
the W&Lbooks to Erica Ingersoll
(1989-91).

The biggest of those stops
came in the ﬁnal minute of last
year’s ODAC title game against
Roanoke, a save that ignited the
run leading to Ripken’s last-sec-
ond game-winning goal.

Of her classmates, Carrington
and Mita, Smith’s words reveal
great respect.

“Both gave it their all,” she
said. “They’ve worked so hard
onindividualthingsandtheteam,
always motivating everyone. I’ve
watched them come so far from
freshmen year.”

The General’s golf team was helped by a late season line-up shift that
aided their charge to the ODAC championship.

Phi Staff Writer

Washington & Lee’s men’s
lacrosse team wraps up the 1994
season with Saturday’s Lee-Jack-
son Lacrosse Classic versus Vir-
ginia Military Institute.

The annual affair between the
Lexington rivals begins at 2:00
at W&L’s Wilson Field. The
Generals have won the last ﬁve
meetings, with last year’s game
being an 18-3 romping of the
Keydets.

Saturday’s game will be the
seventh Classic and the eighth
all-time meeting between W&L
and VMI.

Fresh off their second straight
Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence title, Washington & Lee
dropped a heartbreaker to sixth-
ranked Washington College, 11-
10 in overtime, last Saturday.

The loss dropped the 13th-
ranked Generals to 8-5 overall
and ended any hopes of an Na-
tional Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation Tournament berth.

A win over the Shoremen
would likely have earned W&L
its second straight post season
bid.

“I think [a win] would have,”
said head coach Jim Stagnitta.
‘‘It would have given us three
wins in the top 15 [ranked team].”

Washington & Lee will be
just the third ODAC champion
not to earn a trip to the Division
III tournament.

That probably doesn’t bother
the Generals who did not appear
on their way to a championship
following their ﬁrst conference

ame.

W&L was stunned 12-6 by
Hampden—Sydney, a team that
was 4-8 in the ODAC over the
last two seasons.

This Week:

Track—(M&VV) at NC Invitational

05-07

Aware that no team had ever
won the ODAC without going
undefeated, Stagnitta saw there
would be a tough ﬁght ahead.

“At that time, we just hoped
we’d improve,” said the ODAC
Coach of the Year. “We had the
potential to be a very good team.”

Though many people wrote
the Generals off as title contend-
ers after that loss, the team felt
differently.

“We thought it would be an
uphill battle,” said junior tri-cap-
tain Scott Mackley. “But we
thought Roanoke would still be
the team to beat.”

And beat they did, in one of
the greatest games in W&L la-
crosse

history. The Generals rallied
to turn an 11-6 deﬁcit with six
minutes to play into an overtime
12-11 win.

W&L then cruised through its
remaining ODAC schedule with
blowout wins over Virginia
Wesleyan (22-3), Guilford (18-
1), and _the title clincher against
Randolph-Macon (18-8).

In the Randolph-Macon game,
Mackley racked up seven goals,
one short of the single-game
school record held by Wiemi
Douoguih ’93, who happened to
be in attendance. ,

Senior Colin Higgins also
approached a school record with
six assists, one short of that mark.

With their third ODAC cham-
pionship in four years clinched,
the Generals set their sights on
earning a trip to the NCAA Tour-
nament, a trip W&L made eight
times at the Division I level, and
three times since moving to Di-
vision III in 1987.

The Generals led the
Shoremen 9-7 early in the fourth
quarter at Wilson Field follow-
ing a score by sophomore Adam
Butterworth. Washington then

lacrosse finishes strong V

tallied two goals to tie the corﬁesto

midway through the fourth.

Mackley netted his third goal
of the game late in the quarter to
give W&La 10-9 advantage, but
again the Shoremen came back
to tie, this time with the Generals
1:03 away from victory.

In overtime, Washington Col-
lege wasted little time, taking

just35 seconds to score the game-
winner.

Freshman goalie Doug
Gubner stopped 17 shots for the
Generals, whose record fell to 8-
5, but whose ranking act lly
climbed a spot to 13.

“I thought we were the better
team,” said Mackley. “We made
some mistakes late. We are a
young team, but we won’t be
able to use that excuse next year.”

Stagnitta also thoughtﬁthe
Generals youth (they have only
two seniors) played a factor.

“We were right there,” he said.
“We lost ourcomposure at times,
but we were every bit as good as
them.”

The Generals now must focus
on extending their Lee-Jackson
winning streak to six.

Saturday, W&L will be fac-
ing a team with very similar prob-
lems to their own.

“They’re young, like us,” said
Stagnitta. “They have some gqod
athletes and continue to improve,
but they’re also inconsistent.”

The Keydets (6-6) are an-
chored by sophomore Joe
Brockman, who tallied 20 goals
through the ﬁrst ten games.

Freshman Matt McLean yas
next in scoring with 16 goals and
eight assists.

In goal, sophomore Ryan
Olson has registered a .596 save
percentage against a schedule that
included fourth-ranked North
Carolina, ﬁfth-ranked Virggiia,
and 24th-ranked Lehigh.

Women’s lacrosse missed an ODAC championship season after a 12-6 loss

to Lynchburg College.

Golf charges to title

By Stephen Williard
Phi Sports Editor

Only Rodney Dangerfield
lives like this. After winning the
Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence Championship last week,
the Washington and Lee golf
team found themselves drowned
out by the din offourother spring
sport W&Lconference champion
teams.

The Generals followed up last
season’s 9-4-2 record with a 32
win, nine loss season and the
school’s ﬁrst ODAC champion-
ship since 1991.

Prior to the championships,
the Generals closed out the regu-
lar season on a high note by tak-
ing second out of six teams in a
make-up match at the

Bridgewater Invitational.

The tune-up gave coach E.G.
“Buck” Leslie a chance to work
with his lineup before ODAC’s.
After the tournament, sophomore
Scott Miller and senior Pierce
Smithwick were inserted into the
ODAC lineup in a move that
worked to the General’s advan-
tage as Miller ﬁnished ninth and
Smithwick took second.

Also ﬁnishing strong for the
Generals wasseniorBoWilliams,
who took seventh in the tourna-
ment.

Leslie was quick to credit the
team for the end-of-the-year per-
forrnance.

“I don’t think we ever lost
faith,” said the 20 year coaching
veteran. “They just kept plug-
ging at it, and it paid off.”

Coach Leslie said that the team

had fulﬁlled its three basic gols
for the season. The ﬁrst was to
play well in the tournament. The
other two were to have good in-
dividual perfonnances and a good
match record. According to
Leslie, these led up to the ulti-
mate goal of taking the confd-
ence title.

Experience also played a key
role in the team’s success ac-
cording to Leslie.

“It turned out we had a good
mixture of youth and experience
in our lineup,” commented tlﬁ
coach.

Coach Leslie was named
ODAC coach of the year for his
seventh time.
