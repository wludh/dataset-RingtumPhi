Rescuers treated two people Tuesday evening after this 1983 Toyota Supra smashed into a tele-
phone pole in front of the Warner Center. Samuel Molasco, 23, was driving. He and his passenger,
20-year-old Carmen Pomas-Garcia, suffered only minor bumps and bruises in the accident. Ru-
Ears ﬂooded the campus that Molasco tried to hide a case of beer and pull Pomas-Garcia into the
'ver’s seat before police arrived. Lexington Police Chief Bruce Beard could not confirm these
rumors but did say Molasco was charged with driving under the inﬂuence. Both Molasco and
Pomas-Gracia are local residents. '

W&L Delt to
recolonize

By SARAH GILBERT
Phi Executive Editor

After a slow recovery from an 18-month sus-
pension, the Washington and Lee Delta Tau Delta
House Corporation has decided to petition the
national headquarters for permission to dissolve
the current fraternity and begin again next year
with new members.

Delt House Corporation President Geoff Stone,
‘68, was instrumental in the decision and will be
part of the discussion with Delt nationals.

“We are working to do the best we can for the
fraternity, the alumni, the university and the na-
tional corporation,” Stone said.

When the Delts returned to campus from an 18-
month suspension last fall, the house had difficulty
during Rush and only initiated two new brothers.

Economic factors, among other things, pushed
the House Corporation to rethink the structure of
W&L’s Delt organization, said Stone.

University treasurer Larry Broomall said, “We
wanted a commitment from the house that wouldn’t
force them out of the market. They agreed to phase
up to full occupancy.”

The house, when full, can hold only 19 brothers.
This year, the minimum occupancy was eight, but
the Delts exceeded the minimum.

Student

Next year, however, the minimum of 12 would
not have been met, because only 11 brothers will
return next year, two of whom have decided to live
off-campus.

Stone said a Rush team from the national orga-
nization would come to campus in the fall if they
agreed to the House Corporation’s proposal.

The team would allow the current brothers to
reapply to the fraternity but would not guarantee
them membership. The team and alumni would
work with the fraternity throughout the year to
insure the group’s strength.

“We told the brothers of the house Monday
night what the situation was,” Stone said. “They
and the university have been very cooperative.”

Associate Dean of Students Leroy “Buddy”
Atkins said that the house corporation would prob-
ably talk with the InterFraternity Council soon, but
he had no final notiﬁcation Thursday afternoon.

“lt’s a decision they have to make that’s been
driven mainly by economics,” Atkins said. “The
consideration is of keeping the house open with the
members they’ve got now.”

Broomall said the university was being as ﬂex-
ible as possible.

“The university doesn’t want to force a frater-
nity out of business,” Broomall said. “If they’re
going to go our, they’re going out for some other
reason.”

student employment records will be in-
complete until long after graduation, be-
cause many students are still interview-
ing for law jobs. Others must take the bar
exam before applying for jobs such as
district attorneys and prosecutors.
Philipps said that by the time barexam
results arrive, about 95 percent of law
school graduates usualy have jobs. That
percentage may be even higher, because
many graduates never report their job
ﬁndings to the Placement Office.

Reggie Aggarwal will have a job after
graduation, but he admits competition for
law careers is fierce.

“Even if you go to a good school,” said
Aggarwal, “you still have people who are
top in their classes who still don’t have
jobs.”

Aggarwal said limited availability of law
jobs has affected W&L law students.

ar tax eliminated by city;

in caraccident

By RICHARD WEAVER
Phi Associate Editor

Washington and Lee junior
Walker Mitchell remains in the
Neuro-Trauma Intensive Care
Ward of Roanoke Memorial Hos-
pital after a head-on wreck on
State Rt. 501 between Buena
Vista and Glasgow on May 13.

Mitchell was heading back to
Lexington after dropping his girl-
friend off in Lynchburg when he
drove through a curve and veered
into the opposite lane.

Mitchell’s car struck a
Chevrolet Blazer driven by
Buena Vista resident Michael
Wheeler,who was carrying three
passengers. The passengers in

Wheeler’s car received only mi-
nor injuries.

The Buena Vista and Glasgow
Rescue Squads used the Jaws of
Life to get Mitchell out of his
1986 Oldsmobile. Mitchell had
been trapped in his car for close
to an hour. He was then taken to
the Roanoke hospital. Mitchell
broke both arms and both legs,
and had to have his spleen re-
moved. Mitchell also suffered
brain hemorrhaging.

Mitchell’s parents, Chaio and
Walker Mitchell, Sr. , ﬂew in from
their home in Madrid, Spain,
when they learned of their son’s
accident.

Thursday afternoon Mrs.
Mitchell said her son’s condition
was improving.

“He’s following all com-
mands. This morning I asked him
to open his mouth and he did,”
Mrs. Mitchell said. “He seems
like he’s going in the right direc-
tion. Now, it’s a question of time
and patience.”

“We have faith, and we pray.
God has listened to our prayers.
I’ll stay here next to Walker until
he gets well,” she said.

“We are asking everyone to
keep praying,” she added.

Charges have not been ﬁled
in the case.

Mitchell’s friends are rally-
ing around him.

Freshman Barton Forman
said, “Everybody knows he will
come through, and we expect him
to recover soon."

ction follows state directive

Students searching for a way
0 avoid the student car tax can
reathe a sigh of relief next year.
ington City Council voted
0 eliminate the controversial
ersonal property tax in a May
1 2 budget meeting.
However, students are still
esponsible for 1 993-94 tax bills.
“This year’s still an obliga-
ion,' City Manager Jon Ellestad

. aid. “These 1993-94 bills are

alid, and we will be aggressive
n collecting them.”
The council’s decision fol-
owed a new Virginia state law
hich prohibits Lexington from
axig student-owned cars regis-
ered outside of Lexington but
till allows the city to tax parent-
)wned cars that are garaged in
ity limits for more than half a
. ear and are not taxed elsewhere.
“Basically, the state legisla-
urebaseliminated the city’s abil-
'ty to collect [only] from cars
wned by students,” Ellestad
said.
Although the city could le-
.- ally continue to tax some par-
ent-owned cars registered out-
sideérof Lexington, Ellestad said
the council decided not to for
everal reasons.
First, it took into account the
egislature’s intentions.
' “Their intention was pretty
clear that they didn’t want uni-
ers'ty communities to collect
he éersonal property tax from
5 any] students,” he explained.

Lexington will no longer tax student cars registered outside of Lexington,
thanks to a new Virginia state law and the Lexington City Council.

Second, “it’s a real headache
to collect to begin with,” he said.

For three years, the city has
taxed as many Virginia Military
institute and Washington and Lee
student cars as it could identify.
VMI has provided the city with a
list of student cars each year,
Ellestad said, but W&L has not,
largely because the university ad-
ministration is opposed to the
tax.

As a result, the city has relied
on the eyes of its officers to iden-
tify W&Lstudent cars, and many
eligible cars were not taxed.

Even when cars are identiﬁed
as belonging to W&L students,
Ellestad said, “we get a lot of
nasty letters from parents out-of-
state” who do not want to pay.

The new law would make the
tax even more difficult to collect
now, Ellestad said, because own-
ership would have to be deter-
mined before a tax could be lev-
ied.

Third, Ellestad said the coun-
cil felt to tax a car based solely on
ownership would be unfair to
students who had to pay. The
new law makes the tax inequi-

table, he said.

The city is sorry to see the tax
go, because it did generate a sig-
nificant amount of money for the
fiscally stressed city.

Last year, Ellestad said, the
city collected about $65,000 from
the tax at a rate of $4.25 per $100
of value.

But he is relieved that the con-
troversy between the city and
W&L is resolved.

Of course, the city will con-
tinue to tax all cars that are regis-
tered in Lexington regardless of
ownership.

A man in a silk suit hurries by,
As he catches the poor old lady ’s eyes,
Just for fun he says, ‘get a job. ’

So goes Bruce Hornsby’s tune “The Way It
ls.” Has the man in the silk suit talked to you
lately?

If you are a senior, someone like him prob-
ably has. And you wish he would go away.

“l’ve been sending out graduation announce-
ments, so I’ve been talking to some relatives,”
Heather Aussiker said. “They’re like, ‘So what
are you doing?’ and I’m like, ‘Well, let me tell
you...’. [Then they say,] ‘And your parents are
going for that?’ ‘Yeah, they are.’ Sometimes
you just want to say, ‘Yeah, well, I won the
lottery. Leave me alone.”

Aussiker, like many other seniors, will not
be attending conferences or toting a briefcase
the day after graduation. Instead, she’ll be mov-
ing to New York City, where she plans to
become a bartender, work with an acting coach
and “hopefully be on a soap.”

Although Aussker’s plans differ from the
traditional graduate school/formal job applica-
tion approach, she is'not alone. Beverly Lorig,
associate director of the Career Development
and Placement Office, says the office caters to
seniors who represent every facet of the job
hunting process.

“We are seeing students who are coming to
tell us about accepting offers [and] those people
who are still actively engaged in the job
search.,.some just enjoy spring term and decide
that they’ve made a decision to delay any efforts

Seniors search for jobs

_ internship there last summer. Dominion Post's

or big decisions until later in the term,” Lorig
said.

No matter what direction seniors take, they
will compete for jobs with almost 1.2 million
other American graduates.

Have no fear, however. Last week’s issue of
Fortune magazine cited recent surveys which
showed about 80 percent of recent college gradu-
ates seeking employment get a job within six
months.

Julie Townsend is among the seniors who
discovered this optimistic trend in employment
before graduation. She begins work as a public
accountant at Deloitte & Touche in Washing-
ton, D.C. soon after graduation.

Townsend heard about the position through
the accounting department and CDP. She got an
offer after her on-campus interview with the
company.

“Accounting interviews are in the fall, and I
had accepted before December,” Townsend said.
“The interviews are very organized; it’s not like
hit-or-miss.”

Christina Wheeler also found a job through
CDP. She will work on computer projects as a
staff consultant at Andersen Consulting in
Washington, D.C.

Brennan McBride found a job under differ-
ent circumstances. He became acquainted with
the owner of Dominion Post, a production com-
pany in Arlington, Va., through his journalism

owner was a student of Professor Bob de Maria,
who advised McBride to apply for a video
editing job with the company.

Finding a journalism job is unlike finding
one in most other fields.

Huntley set to retire next week

By ERIN LEONARD
Phi News Editor

English Professor Bob Huntley sat
atop the high stool in his office this
week and pondered his upcoming re-
tirement.

“I’m firmly convinced that young
people learn better from young people,”
the 65-year-old said when asked why
he has chosen now to leave.

“Their points of reference are more
apt to be like,” he explained. “In teach-
ing English, so much has to be analogi-
cal.”

So Huntley and his sheepdog Ollie
will say goodbye next week to his job,
his Payne Hall ofﬁce that overlooks the
front lawn and chapel and his students
as Huntley completes 32 years of Wash-
ington & Lee service.

His students will miss him.

“His retirement will be the biggest
loss to the English department, be-
cause he has so much student loyalty,-”
junior Kelly Brotzman said.

Brotzman has taken three classes
from Huntley, and he is her advisor as
well.

“Students are just drawn to him,”
she said. “He forces them to think about
what they’re doing besides just accept-
ing what a professor says.”

Brotzman spoke of Huntley’s kind,
gentle manner.

Students who know Huntley are
familiar with his casual dress, his gray-
ing beard and his dog Ollie.

“More students know Ollie than
know me,” he said. “l’ve had requests
to leave Ollie behind.”

An interesting fact most students

are not aware of is that Huntley was
the first bearded W&Lprofessor since
Robert E. Lee’s time. '

“An alumnus reported me and my
beard to the Board of Trustees,”
Huntley laughed. He said the issue
was dropped when then History De-
partment Chair Ollinger Crenshaw
remarked to an alum how much
Huntley resembled Lee.

“He was joking, but the alumnus
didn’t know that,” Huntley said.

Huntley also laughed as he de-
scribed how he came to W&L in 1962.

“I blundered into the place really,”
he said.

While teaching at Northern Illinois
University, he came to Virginia to
interview for a position at Hollins
College.

On his way home, he took Route 11
North through Lexington. As he drove
by what is now the Student Telecom-
munications office, he looked to his
left. The Colonnade sat before him the
hill.

‘‘‘Now that’s what a school ought to
look like,’ I thought. So I went and
proffered my services, and l’ve been
here ever since,” Huntley said.

Huntley has accomplished much
during his W&L career, but you will
not hear it from him.

“People do not realize how much
he’s done here, because he doesn’t
trumpet it. He’s too modest,” said En-
glish Professor Ed Craun, a colleague
of Huntley’s for 22 years.

He spoke of the ten or so years that
Huntley served as Dean of Freshmen.

“He was great with freshmen be-
cause above all he really knows how to
listen sympathetically and how to

English professor Bob Huntley and his dog, Ollie, are enjoy-

ing their last couple of weeks at W&L

awaken them,” he said.

The same abilities that made Huntley
effective with freshmen carried over to
all students, Craun said.

“I think that students have come to
value him for the way he brings out
their abilities,” Craun said.

“You could say one thing is the way
that he understands the gentle art of
nurturing students as readers and writ-
ers,” he continued.

Junior Leslie Hallett has taken four
classes from Huntley and she agreed.

‘‘I love Professor Huntley.‘He is just
one of the most caring individuals and
one of the most interesting teachers,”
she said.

Brandstedter faces a preliminary court date

The Media Chairman and Vice-Chairman will
obtain national, state and local press coverage of the

“l’ve always thought the Mock Convention was a

an integral part of the Mock Convention because
extensive media coverage makes it easier to get

wonderful opportunity pass him by.

“The rewards and experiences of the Mock Con-
vention are unmatched by anything you get in a

The Alumni Chairman will work with the Firhanc
and Public Relations Committees in order to commu-

Guerin said she applied for Alumni Chairman
because her work with the Student Development

there has been talk about getting together a grogp of
alumni to give advice.

She said she had always wanted to be part of Mock

valuable experience for people her age.

The Social Chairman will plan the social aspects
of the Spring Kickoff and the Mock Convention as
well as the Presidential Gala. 9

Foote said she applied for Social Chairman be-
cause she had always wanted to be a part of the Mock

“l have always been fascinated by the election
process and politics in general,” she said.

Foote said she was interested by the virtual re-

The Crow _ ﬁikﬁ 1/2

It’s hard to ﬁnd a good action ﬂick these
iays. They’re either pathetic sequels (Predator
’, Higilander 3, Rambo 4) or politically driven
ropaganda pieces (Stephen Segal’s latest).

So, The Crow is a welcome departure from
hat lot, providing a new star (Brandon Lee, son
-f Bruce) with a clever forum for his talent.

Lee plays Eric Draven (get it? "raven" :
crow"? clever, no?), a rock guitarist who is
illecgwith his fiancee by four gang members.
i year later, Draven returns from the cemetery
iiterally tearing up the earth to get out) to
venge their deaths.

And not only is he given a second chance to
i.ve, Draven also gets this neat power which
ill almost instantly heal any wounds he gets,
rgo, e can’t be re-killed.

Lee stalks across the scenes, casting his
rooding and painted glare at everyone (he
rears mime make-up throughout). The bad
uys are very bad, the police are tired and
isillusioned, and the city is dark and moody.
'he plot trots along, with very little to distract
s from the business of revenge (with the ex-
ptitﬁi of a silly sub-plot concerning a street
irl and her mom).

These characters, valet and maid to the Count and
Countess, plot with the neglected Countess to shame the

ﬁckle Count into mending his ways.

The Marriage ofFigaro comically plays on politics and
sex in the eighteenth century. Politically, Beaumarchais
original 1778 comedy attracted Mozart and friend Lorenzo
da Ponte. While Beaumarchais’ comedy was dangerous
because it presented society as ready for revolutionary

change, Mozart and Da Ponte seized upon it as the perfect

comic opera.

Still, it would be a controversial gesture. Joseph II of
Austria had banned Beaumarchais’ play before.

Da Ponte, however, managed to convince the Emperor
that all offending passages would be taken out. Cleverly, Da
Ponte and Mozart still managed to work in calls for social
subversion in Figaro.

These behind-the-scenes politics are comically comple-
mented by the sexual antics of the characters. Cherubino,
for example, is a women dressed as a man, and comedy

erupts when Cherubino is dressed up as a woman by the

tire of his perpetual healing; there
is something inherently thrill-
ing in seeing the good guy con-
found his opponents, -rising just
when they think they have ﬁ-
nally beaten him (q.v. Clint
Eastwood in A Fistﬁtl of Dol-
lars).

However, the real strength of
the movie lies not in its gener-
ally predictable plot, but in the
fresh scripting. The ﬁlm is sim-
ply very pleasant to sit through;
we actually listen to what every-
one says and are rewarded with
clever yet realistic dialogue. The
characters are given witty lines,
but never deliver fake "wise-
cracks in the busy action scenes.

The one complaint I might
register with this ﬁlm (besides
the unnecessary street girl char-
acter) is that the action scenes
aren’t quite up to par. The larg-
est ﬁght scene, when Eric Draven
single-handedly takes on twenty
or more of the city ’s chief wrong-

doers, is ﬁlmed very haphazardly, and as if
under strobe lights. I got the feeling I was
watching something shot in "Confuso-vision."
After having watched many a Van Damme
action ﬂick where the characters are apparently
pulled directly from a hat, the reality and ﬂesh
these are given is quite refreshing. Top Dog, the
arch-villain, is played with just enough human-
ity to make his evil seem so much more real.

 

unsuspecting Susanna
and Countess as a
woman to go meet the
Count.

Figaro, however, is
not just a simple comedy
of sex and politics.

Love, forgiveness

and hurt all interweave
themselves into the mu-
sic, giving Mozart’s
masterpiece both direct
lightheartedness and
complex seriousness.

Many considerthe ﬁ-
nale of Act II to be the
musical triumph of

Figaro.

It chronicles the
fighting Count and
Countess with many
other complications of
plot. Even Mozart was
amazed by the brillaince
of this ﬁnale, according
to Timothy Gaylard.

Starring in Washing-
ton and Lee’s produc-
tion of Figaro are: Jen-
nifer Ray ’94 (Susanna),
Mandy Irons ’95
(Marcelina), Allen
F lickinger ’94 (Bartolo),

Michelle Brien ’94
(Barbarina), and Meagan
Miller ’96 (Countess
Almaviva), among oth-
ers.
The part of Figaro is
being played by Larry
Evans, a professional
singer and Lexington
resident who has sung in
over thirty operatic roles
withanumberofcompa-
mes.

The high concentra-

tion of vocal talent at
W&L this year contrib-
uted to the decision to
put on an opera this year,
especailly so the seniors
would be able to express
their talent to the school
one last time.

Mozart’s demanding
solos require the kind of
vocal range and endur-
ance that W&L's gifted
group ofseniors have this
year.

Dr. Gordon Spice and
Dr. J.D. Martinez made
several changes to the
opera to make the pro-
duction feasible within
the constraints of time
and money. They short-
ened the original story,
decided to sing the opera
in English, and substi-
tuted a piano for a full-
sized orchestra.

A preview show was
held on May 18.

Opening night is to-
night, Friday the 20th.
Additional perfor-
mances are on May 22
and 24.

All performances be-
gin at 8:00 p.m. in the
Keller Theater.

tion, call the Lenfest Box

illegal as one that dismisses the beliefs
of Native Americans.

In this case, Carter’s criticism is
valid.

However, what about animal sacri-
ﬁce? Or human sacriﬁce?

Should Americans accommodate
these practices in the name of religious
freedom?

Most Americans certainly would
not.

It may have. been practiced in An-
cient Greece, but it would not be toler-
ated in America.

He further tackles the infamous 1992
Republican National Convention:
“What was wrong with the 1992 Re-
publican Convention was not the ef-
fort to link the name of God to secular
political ends. What was wrong was
the choice of secular ends to which the
name of God was linked.”

The problem stems from politics
leading faith instead of the other way

(Although the credits list Michael Wincott as
the actor who portrays Top Dog, I have sneak-
ing suspicion it is really Anthony Kiedis of the
Red Hot Chili Peppers.)

The agreeable black policeman, Albrecht, is
given life by Ernie Hudson, who does a simi-
larly excellent job of not letting his character
become so easily stereotyped. It would have
been very easy to play this role as the archetypal

 

  he Culture of Disbelief marred by contradictions

around.

Oftentimes, the “political preacher”
ﬁts his religious beliefs into his politics
which Carterconsideis morally wrong.

He also criticizes the notion of a
“Christian Nation” because it is poten-
tially dangerous, particularly in the case
of the Jews.

Ultimately, Carter offers a compel-
ling argument that religious devotion
is relegated to a second-class position
in society.

He gives a clearer deﬁnition of the
Establishment and Free Exercise Clause
in the Constitution.

However, his contradictions fre-
quently get in the way of his occasional
good points.

His concept of religion’s role in
society and the notion of trying to ac-
commodate every religion is uncon-
vincing.

He argues that the state must have a
compelling reason to intervene in the

doughnut-munching beat cop,
whose good ideas are always
ignored by his overly-tense su-
periors.

Rather, the policeman is
kept fresh and alive, typical
not as a stereotype but as a
worthy representative of his
class.

Of course, the ultimate char-
acter in the film is none other
than the Crow himself, Eric
Draven. Unfortunately, what
makes this role come through
so powerfully, what makes this
otherwise typical avengerseem
so immediate and possible is
nothing but the death of Bran-
don Lee.

Only a few days before the
end of ﬁlming, Brandon Lee
was accidentally shot on the
set.

As if the eerie parallels to his
father’s early death weren’t
enough, Lee’s striking similari-
ties to the character Eric Draven

are also troubling. Draven is shot the day before
his wedding and was an aspiring guitarist with
a bright future.

Lee was planning on marrying his girlfriend
(the "Eliza" mentioned in the credits) shortly
after the ﬁlming of the movie was completed,
and of course his own very promising movie
career was cut extremely short.

The knowledge that Lee is dead makes all of

     

his scene’s seem so much more powerful.

Essentially, The Crow is an enjoyable action
picture which should reach beyond the typical
twenty-something male audience.

It is something of a cross between Batman
and Blade Runner, a sort of higher class Under
Siege.

Although it wouldn’t lose much on the small
screen, if you’re at the theater and don’t have
your mind set on a particular ﬁlm, The Crow is
a safe bet. It rates three and one-half stars.

Seniors approach job search with different ideas

In» From JOBS, page 1

“You don’t go through the same

ess as you do...working for a bank

or working for some ﬁnancial institu-
tion,” McBride said.

“A lot of it places emphasis on who
you know and who knows you and if
you can network.”

Networking and using alumni con-
t&ts has helped many seniors, Lorig
said.

“Our office is the starting point for
meeting alumni,” she said. “Most
people will ﬁnd their jobs through per-
sonal leads or referrals or direct appli-
cation, so it’s important that our stu-
Qnts use the total alumni base as an
opportunity to develop jobs.”

McBride says he owes his job offer
in part to both networking and luck.

“I just happened to be foitunate...this
kind of just fell in my lap,” he said.

I, What about those who aren’t so
liptky?

0 Commitment and persistence often
pay off in job-searching.

Grant Rea, whom Bank One of Lou-
isville, Ky., hired as a management
trainee, visited the company several

times.

. “I basically went there and spent a
day speaking with people and inter-
viewing, and I did that on four separate
occasions,” Rea said.

Wheeler got her staff consultant
position through perseverence.

“I sent my resume in, and then it V

came back, and I was an alternate,”
Wheeler said. “I called the guy and
said, ‘Look, I’m an alternate, and I
don’t want to be an alternate.’ So he
gave me an interview, and then I got an
office visit...I got the offer about two
weeks later.”

Like Wheeler, ownsend relied on
an interview to get her job. Townsend
described her pre—interview jitters.

“I was extremely nervous,” she said.
“I don ’t know why I thought they would
ask me questions that I wouldn’t know
the answers to. All they’re doing is
asking you to talk...about yourself.”

Townsend offered advice from her
experience.

“The best thing you can do is to
have conﬁdence and to show conﬁ-
dence,” she said.

Wheeler recalled one interview she
had that did not lead to an offer.

“I went into Wachovia Bank for an
ofﬁce visit, and I thought I had wow’ed
them,” she said. “I had read the paper.
I had picked up stuff on derivatives,
and I knew Wachovia did a lot of work
with derivatives. I got a letter that said
they didn’t have any openings.”

Her advice:

“Really look at your interview and
say, ‘Okay, maybe I...need to tone it
down a little bit,’” Wheeler said. “The
best thing is talking to someone...your
advisor, a professor...maybe they’ll go
through with you and help you on some
points.”

Wheeler also gave advice on inter-
view preparation.

“You just cannot be afraid of rejec-
tion. You have to be determined and
persistent. You have to go into [the
interview] and say, ‘All right, they may
say no, but I have to make them realize
that I’m the best thing that they’re
going to get.”’

I wrote a follow-up letter to all those
schools and said, ‘Please send me lit-

After getting no responses, Eastland
visited the career ofﬁce, where she was
told to send a second letter to the
schools. She expected to continue her
job hunt.

“I was very prepared to have my job
search go through the summer,” she
said. “That’s what

Kathleen Eastland, who will teach
French at Darlington School in Rome,

her interview through the Selective Lib-

also encouraged her to be persistent.

almost 30 schools [through SLAC and
other teacher placement agencies], and

advice to students entering the job hunt.

“Forget the summer camps and for-
get the job ﬂipping burgers or working

you ought to take an internship up there

nance so far is too great.

Or, if you like, spend the summer
after graduation looking for a job.

That’s what Becca Reed intends to
do. She had planned to go to graduate
school but decided to begin her job
search instead. In order to avoid the
hassle of leaving W&L for interviews
and diving into corporate waters the
day after graduation, Reed will post-
pone her search.

“To me it seems like most of the
[employers] want you to stai1...right
away, and that’s why I feel more com-
fortable waiting until summer, when I
can go up for interviews whenever I
want to,” Reed said.

She said her parents would like her
to have a job before she graduates but
that they are understanding.

“They always ask me, ‘How’s your
resume coming along?’ and ‘Have you
gone to career development?’...but
they’ve been pretty good about it,”
Reed said.

ive.

“They want to see me succeed and
be happy in whatever I do,” she said.

And Aussiker admits her plans to
tend bar and act in New York are not
concrete.

“This is the plan right now at 6:10
p.m. this evening,” she said last Tues-
day. “It may change in a couple of
minutes. You never know.”

Aussiker intends to “read papers,
see what’s happening, and go to
auditions...pound the pavement.”

Aussiker’s parents are also support- I

If she ﬁnd that theateris not for her,
she may use another idea to get a job.

“Plan B is to go to grad school in
broadcast journalism and be a sports
broadcaster,” she said. “That would be
at 6:15 p.m. That’s the plan.”

Whatevertheir intentions, Lori g said
she hopes that, before they graduate,
seniors will know how to have a good
interview and how to write an effective
resume and cover letter.

Lorig also said networking skills
are important for both men and women
graduates. While W&L men have used
alumni contacts from their fraternities
for many years, the Panhellenic Coun-
cil and the Wiomen’s Forum are recog-
nizing that women need similar con-
tacts and are trying to form a similar
network.

In addition, the CDP ofﬁce will be
open throughout the summer. On June
6, the ofﬁce will move into the old
Sigma Chi house, recently named the
Mattingly House, at Washington Street
and Lee Avenue. Because of the move,
the ofﬁce’s library resources will be
limited during packing the week of
May 30. I

Lorig said graduates often return to
W&L over the summer for help from
CDP.

“We continue to work with gradu-
ates after they leave, but it would be my
hope that seniors would learn the basic
job-hunting skills before they leave so
that the transition of returning home is
not such a challenge.”

Of the applications and nominations, Watt
said about 25% were presently presidents of
other institutions and 30% are vice-presi-
dents. The rest are mixed between non-
academic deans, college professors and
people with some college work. Watt also
said about four or ﬁve alumni are included in
the pool of applications and nominations.

Although he cannot speak speciﬁcally
about the applications or nominations, Watt
said there are “some very good prospects.”

The committee will meet next on May 30
and possibly over the summer.

The revitalization plan for Gaines Hall will
result in relatively few changes forthe residents
of Gaines.

Aside from renovations to four designated
sorority suites and a Women’s Forum suite, the
only possible change is the possible conversion
of a third floor single room near the Women’s
Forum suite to a lounge/kitchen area.

Dennis Manning, Dean of Freshmen and
Residence Life, said the room would be a
previously detached single room or Resident
Advisor’s room. The room may be “converted
into a food preparation area” available to all
residents of Gaines, Manning said.

The cinder-block walls will not be plastered

over, as previously proposed, because of  :

Plastering the walls would be “prohibitively
expensive,” Dean Manning sid. Other forms of
wall coverings are being looked into for future
years, but the cost of installation and mainte-

   
  

The loft suites for the sororities will undergo
several changes. In each suite there will be an
ofﬁce/storage space, a lounge for members to
visit, a guest room for visiting chapter consult-
ants and a bathroom. -

According to David Howison, Dean of Stu-
dents, the suites will serve as “a kind of multi-
purpose room” for programs that now take
place in the University Center. Sororities will
still have their large chapter meetings in the
University Center.

The Women’s forum has not yet conﬁrmed
what will go into its suite. The group does have
“exactly the same options as the sororities,”
Dean Howison said.

The exact number of Gaines residents for
next year is still unknown. Because of tranfer

. students and students that are even now signing
,up,'--‘»‘.tli"e numbers are still in flux,” Dean Man-

ning said.

There will probably be between 160 and 170
students living in Gaines. The dormitory has a
potential occupancyof roughly 200.

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

The Next President is . . .

The Presidential Search Committee is starting
the long, arduous process of finding out of almost a
hundred applications the ten most qualified people to
be president of this university. Every student on
campus, especially the freshmen should be thinking of
what they would like to see in the next president.

Think of all the changes our out- going president
has brought to this school, the next one could bring
more and they might be undesirable. So please write
letters to the Board of Trustees (who ultimately picks
the president) about what you might want to see in the
next president of Washington and Lee.

The search will continue and they will still be
taking applications and nominations until about
November, when the committee ﬁnally submits their
list of ten lucky people to the board.

This is a lot of time to write in, but the criteria are
going to be set soon. The committee has already
recieved criteria from the board were presented at the
ODK initiation ceremony earlier this year by RectorA.
Stevens Miles.

The board needs to know what the students want
in the person that will be their president after President
Wilson retires from brick-laying.

Write the Board of Trustees or the Presidential
Search Committee (Professor William Watt) and get
involved in the search.

Look back on this year withfearj

The 1993-94 session of Washing-
ton and Lee University is quickly draw-
ing to a close.

In just a few short weeks W&L
students will be finishing up exams,
packing their bags, and heading else-
where for the summer recess. What has
been learned by the W&L student this

trouble seems to stem from the fact that
he really doesn’t seem to care about
foreign policy all that much. It was
reported recently that Clinton went over
a week without a meeting with his top
policy advisors, instead, he was selling
his health care “plan” to the American
public. Remember that old saying, a

 

week he entertains us with a new scan-
dal and a new crisis. When Bill Clinton
told us that he was going to revitalize
the economy, we assumed he meant
more than just the tabloid market. It
seems a bit frightening that the New
York Times is following the leads of the
National Inquirer. There is more to
this president than simple sex
scandals, however: foreign policy,
for example.

Well, perhaps foreign policy isn’t
the best example of the president’s
leadership. Inorder to lead, it is general
advisable to have some sort of policy
first; the president seems not to have
one, or at least a successful one. On the
issue of Haiti, for example, Clinton did
nothing until he was guilted into action
by Robinson’s hunger strike. CIinton’s

more local news, right here in

spending a night at the city’s expense.
Which brings me to a poignant ques-
tion; what is the point of the drunk in
public laws? Here is a very real situa-
tion: After a few hours at the Palms or
a local party a W&L student decides to
walk home instead of driving, a re-
sponsible decision by most accounts, a
few minutes later a Lexington police
ofﬁcer picks him up and gives him a

On the Hill, W&L students learned
that being a fraternity member is not
safe. If you’re not being assailed as
racist, sexist, perpetrator of a stereo-
type, you’re being ﬁned, penalized, or
chucked off campus. What business is
it of the university, I wonder, to dictate
the social lives of its students. Fratemi-
ties are independent, autonomous, and
above all, voluntary student organiza-
tions, over which the universityshould
have little, if any, control.

University is facing several

critical campus issues as we

move into the next century. However, I am tired of
repeating them as I am sure that the small number of
you who actually read this are tired of hearing
about them.

Instead I am going to be a bit selﬁsh and use this
last column to say, “Thank you” to some of the folks
on campus. These are people that have helped make
my time in Lexington memorable, they are not the
only ones, but if I were to list everyone Sarah would
have to let me take over the ﬁnal issue. Anyway, here
is my list of the most memorable and least often
thanked people at W&L.

W&L SECURITY — Mike, Steve, Melvin,
Larry, Ruth, Shannon, Fred C., Fred R., AI, Joe,
Tony, “Sonny,” and Baner. Any of us who have ever:
needed a ride, had our car “T & T’d,” needed a door
opened, needed help, or even needed a good laugh
know that these are some of the very finest folks on
this campus. They always place the best interest of
the students first and they never let you forget that,
“You can’t park on the ‘yella!’” Thanks for every-
thing —— the “Commissioner.”

REGISTRAR’S OFFICE — Donna, Karen,
Miss Jarvis, and Scott. These folks have taken a lot
from everyone on this campus. They answer our
questions, they collect our forms, and they take our
grief. The next time you’re wondering why they
aren’t always smiling happily when you see them,
consider whether or not you would be smiling if you
had their workload. It’s difﬁcult and they do a hell of
a job! Next time you stop by, try smiling yourself,
then say thank you!

CAMPUS SECRETARIES —- There are too
many to mention but what’s truly amazing is that they

ladies, you’re terriﬁc.
CAREER DEVEL-
OPMENT — Beverly borig, Ruth Lewis, and Vicki
Saunders. Those of you who are not seniors will just
have to trust me that most people here, at one time or
another, probably should have offered to give these
women a small house. Imagine the stress of having to
ﬁnd employment for 400 people every year. Phe-
nomenal is the only word
that comes to mind!
LIBRARY STAFF
—- How many times
have you asked them
where to ﬁnd a book,
magazine, article, etc.?
If you’re like me, more
times than you care to
remember. Some of my
favorites: Tammy at cir-
culation, Yolanda in
Reference, and Mrs.
Brittigan —— the ILL
Queen. Thanks to
them all! I
CO-OP IADIES —
I challenge anyone to
show me a group of people who put up with more
than these women. Many of them have been working
on this campus for years and probably know a lot
more about it than most of us, and yet they rarely even
get a “thank you.” Think about that next time you’re
ordering a chicken ﬁlet. '
INFIRMARY — One last group “thanks” to this
team of professionals. Whether they are saving a life
or repairing a ﬁnger cut, they are always friendly and
always willing to discuss any problem. Working on

from the rest.

—".“*—(C

But, in general we are fortunate
to have people who make this
campus a community, they make it
a place you long to return to and a
place you hate to leave. That’s a
tradition that truly sets us apart

a college campus is not a health care professional-’s
dream, it takes commitment and dedication and these
people have both!

There are also a few folks who should be
thanked individually. ‘

Diane Johnson in thebusiness ofﬁce, always
smiling and pleasant even when you know you’re
driving her crazy. Fontanne Bostic, a genuine W&L
treasure, she has the answer to anything you ever
wanted to know about W&L, but were afraid to ask.
Agnes Gilmore, someone once described her to me
as, “the most beautiful woman on campus,” she’ is
also the most genuine soul I have met here and I am
all the better for it. Larry Broomall, the friendliest
administrator I know, always willing to listen, even
to the smallest problem. Burr Datz, I think everyone
knows and respects “the hardest working man at
Washington and Lee.” Finally, Dean Anne Schroer-
Lamont, probably the most embattled administramr
on the Hill, while also being one of the ﬁnest. She has
worked tirelessly to make this University a better
place and any true W&L
gentleman or lady would
recognize that and say
“hank you.”

All of these people
have been important to
me while I’ve been here.

Actually being on the river has been interesting to
say the least. The really fun parts for me have been
watching other people tip their canoes and fall in the
river. This is especially amusing because, as of press
time, I have not tipped...yet. [Editor’s note: Ms.
Green tipped this past Tuesday, aﬂer her deadline. ]
There is nothing more amusing to me than watching
my fellow students wring out their soaking wet
polypropylene (okay, not really) outfits. The ﬁrst
time it happened was rather upsetting for me, mainly
because I hadn’t safely maneuvered that stretch of
river yet‘ and ‘wanted '-to stay dry. ‘One minute
they were fine, the next, Glenn is yelling,

hitting his head on a rock screamed, “Me, too!”
Later, as the hypothemtia set in, they were slightly
less chipper. Kris very somberly said, “Y’all, my
legs are blue. They’re not ordinarily that color.”
Canoeing has not always been so lively. Some-
times you have to make more of it. My canoeing

wet the rims, salting them, and whipping up frozen
drinks in our portable blender. I will be at the bow of
the boat in a French maid outﬁt alternately rowing
and serving drinks. Whoever has most recently
fallen into the river is the ofﬁcial Hypothennia Boat.

Sommersby, and
all other movies
they ﬁlmed here in MetroLex, perhaps
the general public is getting tired of
hearing about our little college nestled
in the mountains. Besides, no one can
understand my jokes, which are based
on W&L culture. For instance, Sbar
joked about Fancy Dress. Spos would
argue that you can’t even begin to
explain FD to the general reading pub-
lic when alcohol prevents you from
even remembering the theme of
the ball.

Setting the book thing aside, I would
like to address the student body one
last time to discuss the most important
issue that has ever been taken up in this
column: the attitude of students toward
campus politics. Spos’ view on this is

simple. Read your newspapers. Get
involved. Know who is doing what and
for what reasons. Last night, someone
told me that it was okay for the EC to
spend $1400 on dinner because they
have worked extremely hard through-
out the year. I told this person that he
was an idiot and that he had missed
point, the point being that the EC had
told several campus organizations that
they were under ﬁnancial constraints
and had to cut budgets this year. You
can’t claim to have been almost broke
one day and then turn around the next
day and blow a huge wad of dough on
dinner at the most expensive restaurant
in town.

This person who upheld the tacki-
ness of the EC is probably an idiot, but
at least he is following campus politics.

Other students just sit back and
watch the administration and other or-
ganizations commitblunderafterblun-
der and they couldn’t care less.

The unenlightened follower of cam-
pus issues is better off than the guy who
never picks up a copy of the campus
newspaper. For this same reason, I
have more respect for the dingalings at
The Spectator. Although their stories
often miss the point, at least they’re
trying, for God’s sake.

l’ve been doing this for over two
years now, and I ’d like to think that my
column has had an effect on people.

Thank you all for your kind (and un- '

kind) responses over the past two-
plus years.

These past four years have been the -

best of my life (despite the fact that Mr.
Columbia is in possession of Washing-
ton Hall, even as I write this).

Please keep the faith and if you see
me in the Palms, or anywhere else for
that matter, please approach me and
speak your mind about something im-
portant, lest I dismiss you as an idiot.
I’ll even buy you a beer.

Jessica and I are also coordinating canoeing

Nevertheless, we all enjoy the few safe moments
of canoeing peace when faced with the dangers of
rapids. Last week Glenn had us dock our canoes to
scout out the next stretch of river we went through.
To my rather untrained eyes, it seemed_ to be a huge

EC’ alum criticizes
Willson- Walker dinner

To the editor:

I was shocked to read in the May 13
issue that the Executive Committee
had spent $1,400 on dinner for new and
old members as well as the White Book
Review Committee members at the
Willson-Walker House.

I served on the EC each of my 4
years at W&L, and I am stunned by the
audacity of this year’s committee. Let
me correct the opinion of next year’s
president, Kevin Webb.

There has never been a tradition of
such waste of the student body’s ﬁ-
nances. Bob Tompkins andlimmy Kull,
as well as this year’s committee, have
done a great injustice to the student
body and should apologize.

While the EC does make food pur-
chases for itself when it is required to

meet during mealtimes and for long
hours (I saw many sunrises from the
committee room) and has informal
gatherings at the beginning and end of
the school year, nothing occurred dur-
ing my tenure which was so disrespect-
ful of the office held.

Mr. Tompkins unwisely has served
as a bad example to next year’s presi-
dent and committee.

I only hope that members of the
student body will lay the blame of
misfeasance on the outgoing commit-
tee and will not think that all Executive
Committees have been or will be irre-
sponsible in the heat of spring term and
graduation.

To the editor:

I take full responsibility for the Executive Committee’s recent dinner with the

I decided it was an appropriate reward for the countless hours of service to the
University that all those present devoted to an issue of paramount importance to

the students of Washington and Lee.

I would like to thank the student body for allowing us to serve them this year’

and for permitting us this indulgence. We had a fantastic time.

Ariel editor apologizes
for use of artwork

To the editor:

Following the recent distribution of
the Ariel literary magazine, it was
brought to my attention that some of
the art work which was published had
not received the artists’ permission
for publication.

Due to a series of unfortunate acci-
dents at the end of the winter term, I
was unaware of this fact, until now. I
regret this error and hope that it has not
inconvenienced these artists. If this
mistake has brought them offense,

I apologize.

In spite of this incident, I hope that;
you will not forget the honor that has
been extended to you, to be
recognized as one of the best artists at
your university. 1

Please accept my apology and com-
pliments on your splendid, albeit
unsolicited, work.

My humblest regards,
Temple Cone

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, May 20, 1994

Four years of W&L reﬂections ,

MY VIEW
Meriwether Nichols, ’94

After four years of my life and over
$80,000 of my mother’s hard-eamed
money, l feel entitled and privileged to
do a little summing up. I hope that you,
my fellow members of this unique com-
munity, will indulge me a few lines to
close this open, bleeding gestalt that
has been my college career. I hardly
want to extend that career by spending
more time on this little piece than on
my work so I’m putting brevity above
artistry and skipping the ﬂuid prose for
which The Ring-tum Phi is known. I
hope you enjoy my comments And
please let me know what you think
because I would love to hear front you.

What I will mks about W&L...

C For starters, the friendly and help-
ful graveyard shift in the library, espe-
cially the lady who sets up the coffee
stand during exams.

O The blurred red and green of the
Hill at about 5:30 am on a foggy
March morning.

O The quietude I experience in
Lee Chapel.

0 All of the bricks, even the ones
around the Corral.

O The many millions of dollars
thrown to remedy the “fraternity prob-
lem.” Is the quality of the education
here so high that we could not have
spent the money on creating more pro-
fessorship and scholarships?

C Self-scheduled and re-scheduled
exams.

C The open-door policy of profes-
sors, deans, secretaries, Miss Jarvis...

O The fact that President Wilson
knows me by name.

' 0 My University Card, eventhough
you couldn’t even tell that it’s
mine anymore.

C Bauer, who has, in his under-
standing of my Addictive Poor Parking
Disorder, torn up a multitude of tickets.

O Being able to talk to the likes of
William F. Buckley and Tip O’Neal

while drinking a Beam and coke at a
cocktail party.

C The Honor Code.

0 How pictures of the Colonnade
never get old and tiresome to me.

C The smell of stale beer in frater-
nity houses. Yes, l know I am probably
the only one who has fond memories of
this pre-Renaissance reality.

0 Holt Merchant’s affection for
crazy Southerners.

C The tunnel-like appearance that
the white columns create when one
stands at Newcomb Hall and looks
toward Tucker.

O The wonderful acoustics in the
women’s bathroom off the downstairs
lobby of the Lenfest Center. It sounds
like you’re in a cave if you sing by
the sinks.

O Smoking in the Co-op.

C The view of the Blue Ridge
from Skylark.

C Once a
month at theTrou-
badour, peaking

I will not miss...

0 Dr. Spice “grinning” the tempo
of Shenandoah to the chorus.

O The speaking tradition that spills
over from the boundaries of the
campus into the larger community
of Lexington.

O The homes along Jackson
Avenue.

Q The Dutch lnnmates, i.e. those
students who have observed the time-
honored tradition of living in the Dutch
Inn, an historic building that may just
may as well be considered part of the
W&L campus.

C Running into a startled Professor
Porter in Newcomb Hall around 3:00
am during finals week.

0 How singing a cappella at W&L
requires an open bar or at least a few
cases of beer, even it means getting
kicked out of the Homecoming
parade.

“Baby dean” creates more trouble than it's worth

To the editor:

After speaking with several alumni this weekend,
I would once again like to voice my opposition to the
new “Baby Dean.”

First, there is nothing in this dean’s job descrip-
tionthat/justifres the hiring of a new adrninistrator.
This dean’s primary purpose is to facilitate commu-
nication and coordination between different groups
on campus. This task, however, can easily be handled
within the current administration. It is ludicrous to
suggest that the countless occupants of Washington
Hall are so busy overseeing a campus of 1,600
students that they are incapable of providing the
requisite amount of assistance to the facilitation
effort.

Second, this “dean of fun” will also create a
“master calendar” of all events occurring on campus.
I am dumbfounded as to why the current deans
cannot accomplish this most difficult task.

Third, students who support this new hiring often
cite the need of different social activities. While I
sympathize with their desires, I am dismayed at their

Keep in mind -

willingness to turn immediately to bureaucrats in
solving their problem.

Alexis de Tocqueville once commented on the
difference between his fellow Frenchmen and Ameri-
cans. Frenchmen, he said, turn to centralized govem-
ment as the ﬁrst l'CSOfl;,Al'l1CflC3H3,. however, f'ust
attempt to solve things themselves and only as a last
resort do they turn to centralized authority.

Tocqueville admired the American style, and I
think if he witnessed this debate, he would be sad-
dened at the new American approach to most prob-
lems (as fostered by W&L) — shirk individual re-
sponsibility and turn problems over to someone else
(preferably a professional bureaucrat with a
Masters degree).

As supposed educators of future generations, l
would hope that the administration would strive to

.energize the efforts of students and encourage inno-

vation. Somehow, l do not believe that this “baby
dean” will contribute to those goals.

Fourth, I would much rather see the S 15,000 spent
on hiring new faculty, providing bonuses to those

who already teach, or perhaps adding it to student
financial aid. 4.

Anyone outside of W&L’s administration -
whether that person be a student, a faculty member,
or an alum — will readily point out that the school’s
bureaucracy is becoming too large and should be
trimmed, not fattened.

My final concern is that this position is a “baby
dean.” Logically, babies become adults, and a $13,000
position in 1995 is likely to become a $40,000 one in
a few years. Our administrators disagree with this
scenario, but I see it as realistic.

This new dean will come to W&L, facilitate
communication and create a calendar, wean people
of their initiative, become a “vital” part of the social
life, and create dependence among grpups
around campus. '

By then the “baby” will have reached maturity,
and W&L will be able to welcome one more full-

fledged dean in its ever-growing ranks. ,.

but the phrase “Saving the best for last,” con-

powerful athletic teams.

By TORY Noro AND

JASON TEETERS
Phi Contributing Writers

Before we begin, let us say
that Steve Williard is a true
“Clipper” fan. Due to technical
difficulties, we have been forced
to talk about the last two weeks
of play and combine our last
two articles into one.

Jason’s pick for the Cup ﬁ-
nals is the Vancouver Bures —
oops the Canucks. The Canucks
steamrolled through the Dallas
Stars. Despite Dallas’ superior
performance against the Blues,
led by law student/former
Gilliam Dorm Counselor Curtis
Joseph, they were no match for
the Canucks.

Trevor Linden and Pavel
Bure led the way to put the only
Texas team out of the playoffs
with a commanding 4-—1 de-
feat in the best of seven series.
The Canucks are facing the
Toronto Maple Leafs in the
Western Conference ﬁnals.

Two Thursday, nights ago,
the Maple Leafs defeated the
Sharks 3——2, in overtime. Mike
Gartner scored the winning goal
to force the decisive seventh

game on the following Satur-
day. This series was a battle of
two rising stars between the
pipes: lrbe “The Wall” and
Felix “The Cat” Potvin.

The Maple Leafs proved to
be too much for the upstart San
Jose Sharks. Tory’s pick for the
Cup ﬁnals is the New Jersey
Devils. The Devs began the
best——of—seven series by drop-
ping the ﬁrst two games to the
Boston Bruins.

Adam Oates, Cam Neely,
and Ray Bourque played well,
but Scott Stevens, Bobby Holik,
Alexander Semak, and Claude
Lemieux rallied the Devils. The
New Jersey club came together
and won the next four games.

The clinching sixth game
was two Wednesdays ago,
which gave the Devils time to
rest before opening the Eastern
Conference Finals series against
their arch-—rivals across the
Hudson River, the New York
Rangers.

The Rangers won the
President’s Cup (best regular
season record) ‘and have not
slowed down in their drive for
the Stanley

Cup. They swept their fel-

    

 

low New ‘Yorkers, the Islanders,
and they beat the Capitals hand-
tily.

With the number one and two
teams in the Eastern Conference
finals, this is a series that you
won’t want to miss as the Rang-
ers attempt to knock off their
third straight team in the com-
petitive Atlantic division.

Now onto the conference ﬁ-
nals, where 'the aforementioned
Vaiico uver Canucks and Toronto
Maple Leafs have evened their
series at one game apiece.

The ﬁrst game went to over-
time with Toronto pulling it out
on a horrible (Harding—esque)
goal. Vancouver’s goaltender,
Kirk McLean, attempted to cut
off a pass outside the crease, near
the circle, and the Toronto skater
easily pushed it pass the ﬂailing
Vancouver goaltender.

Vancouver’s Trevor Linden
scored in the last minute to send
the game to OT. Toronto was led
by Dimitri Mironov with two
goals.

Game Two was equally hard‘

fought. Feisty Jyrki Lumme
scored the game winner late in
the third period to secure
Vancouver’s victory in the see—

So far, the battle of the super-
stars has been relatively even.
Pavel Bure scored his 10th goal
of the playoffs while Doug
Gilmour had a couple of assists
in Game 2.

The battle of goaltenders has
also been even. Kirk McLean
faced 40 shots, saving 37 while
Felix “The Cat” Potvin faced 39
shots saving 35.

By virtue of ending the regu-
lar season as the best team in
hockey, New York earned home
ice advantage. The Devils gave
a shocker to the Rangers by win-
ning their ﬁrst game in seven
outings in the ’93—’94 season
with a big win in Madison Square
Garden in game 1.

The Devils looked to loose

Throughout the spring, junior Marilyn Baker
has methodically gone about the business of
amassing victories. Now that the dust has ﬁ-
nally settled, the standout tennis star holds a
new school record for wins in a season (28) and
is just six victories shy of the career mark. age

The W&L women’s tennis team as a unit
made itself one of the best squads at the school
as well. The women rode a wave of success to
22 victories against only two defeats, both of
those coming in the NCAA tournament. The 22
victories marked a school record for the team.

The team lost to Emory ﬁve to four in the
ﬁfth place match, but the team accomplish-
ments remain formidable. This was their first
tournament appearance since 1991 as a team.
Along with this achievement, the team could

rookie goalie Martin Brodeur to
gain a sixth attacker. The plan
worked and the Devils scored
with under one minute left to
send the game into overtime. Half
way through the second OT pe-
riod the Devils scored the game
winning goal.

New Jersey’s fortunes were
quite different in game two. The
team couldn’t seem to do any-
thing right. When any team plays
as badly as the Devils did on
Tuesday, the goalie cannot hold
out forever. Chris Terreri was
shelled and the Rangers shut the
Devils out four to zero.

Last night’s game in the New
Jersey Meadowlands’ Brendan
Byme Arena went into its third
overtime period in three games.
Graves and Larmer scored for
New York, while Fetisov (his
first playoff goal) and Zelepukiri
scored for New Jersey.

Still, Martin Broduer (60
saves) and Mike Richter (35
saves) have played extremely
well by making more than their
fair share of clutch saves. As a
result, the Devils and Rangers
left regulation in a 2-2 tie.

After a scoreless first over-
time, the Rangers scored a goal
