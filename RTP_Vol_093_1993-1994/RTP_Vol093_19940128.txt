Attention smokers: your days
0 njoying cigarettes in the Co-
op may be numbered.

Gerry Darrell, Washington
and Lee’s director of food ser-
vice, asked the Executive Com-
mittee for advice Monday on a
proposed change in the smoking
p<!icy for campus food service
buildings. The proposed change
in policy would ban smoking in
the Dining Hall, Co-op and the
GHQ.

“People who are allergic to
smoke... know it’s there,” said
Dﬁrell.

Darrell said he received a pc-
tition signed by 70 law students

Wilson extends
FIJI deadline

By MICHELLE BRIEN
Phi News Editor

Phi Gamma Delta fraternity
has been granted a one week ex-
tension on their appeal, making
the new deadline Friday, Febru-
ary 4.

President John D. Wilson said
he granted the extension due to
the gravity of FIJl’s situation.

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee suspended FIJI until July 1995
in an 11-0-1 decision Monday,
Jan. 17. FlJI’s original deadline
to ﬁle a written appeal of the
decision was yesterday.

Wilson met with FIJI House

Corporation President Ed Bishop
and FIJI House Corporation
Member Jack Norberg Monday.
Wilson said Bishop and Norberg
“came to acquaint me with the
fact that they would ﬁle an ap-
peal. They also wanted to know
if I had any special instructions.”

Bishop said he will be writing
the appeal on behalf of FIJI and
the FIJI house corporation this
weekend.

FIJI president Ralph “Moke”
Wolfe said FlJl’s appeal will be
based on fourcriteria: lack of due
process, false information in the
letter to the SAC from Dean of
Freshmen and Residence Life

Dennis Manning in which he
charged FIJI with hazing, too
harsh a penalty, and “the wrong
guys being punished.”

“We were convicted and sen-
tenced before we even got to the
hearing,” said Wolfe.

Dean of Students and SAC
Chair David Howison disagreed.

“SAC was very open-
minded,” Howison said. “We
began deliberations Friday and
then continued until Monday to
be absolutelyicertain in our deci-
sion. The case was decided fairly
and open-mindedly.” ‘

Thieves swipe Sega

SAE house loses game, VCR

By MICHELLE BRIEN

Thieves stole $320 worth of

; television and game equipment

from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon

' fraternity housethe nightofJanu-
-‘ ary 20.

AE member Malcolm Burke

i reported a Sharp VCR, a Sega
_ Genesis, a Sega game and a tele-

;phone as stolen to Lexington
Police at 11:30 that night.
Investigating Officer Gary
Coleman said he does have a
rsuﬁect, but can not release any
_ information because the suspect
:' is a minor.

‘‘I’m trying to wait around
and come up with the stuf ,”
Coleman said. “I have a suspect,
but I haven’t set up an interview.
If I bring him in now all he’s
going to do is lie to me. But ifl
have the stuff to show him, then
he can’t lie.”

Coleman said sources outside
the police department are help-
ing him with the investigation.

“I have people who are talk-
ing to me,” Coleman said.

Burke said he noticed. two
unfamiliar people in the house
around 10:30 p.m., but did not
know if they were responsible
for the theft.

“l was downstairs in the
kitchen of the house about 10:30,”

Burke said. “Twovguys were there
who said they were DJs looking
for work. It seemed odd for them
to be walking around in the fra-
ternity house on a Thursday
night.” .

Burke said the thieves prob-
ably entered through the unlocked
basement door.

“The doors are always open,’
Burke said.

Burke also said the house
probably will not replace the
items, at least not right away.

“The Sega was one of the fra-
ternity brother’s. The VCR and
phone belonged to the house,”
Burke said.

“The Sega will be missed,
though. We used it quite a bit.”

Cadet dies in crash

By E. LEE DAUGHERTY
Phi Staff Writer

Flags ﬂew at half-staff over Virginia Military
lnstitute’s parade groundsJan. 14 as cadets mourned
the death of freshman William Alexander “Alex”
Herbert.

Herbert was killed when his car hit a tree and ‘

burst into ﬂames near his home in northern Virginia
on Jan. 13.

Fairfax County Accident Reconstruction Unit
Officer J .D. Bean said Herbert was traveling on an
icy two-lane country road about 12:30 a.m. Thurs-
day, Jan. 13 when his car skidded out of control.

Neighbors called police when they heard the
car’s tires explode from the heat of the ﬁre, Bean
said. ‘

VMI Public Relations Director Colonol Michael
Strickler said police had trouble identifying Herbert
because his body was badly burned.

Bean said in order to identify Herbert police
took his carapart and found what is known as a “con
vin”, or concealed vehicle identification number.
But he said police were not able to get the car apart
to find the number until 10 a.m., nearly 10 hours
after the accident occurred. Bean said once police
found the con vin they were able to trace Herbert’s
identify through it.

Strickler said Herbert’s parents did not realize
until later Thursday morning that he had not come

home. They contacted VMI, thinking he had re-
turned to school early in order to prepare to march
in Governor George Allen’s inaugural parade Sat-
urday. They Ieamed of their son’s death later from
police.

Strickler said at the time of the accident Herbert
was headed to his home in Hemdon after visiting
his girlfriend who lived 15 minutes away from his
home.

Strickler said Herbert was a history major.
Fellow cadet Chris Doyle said Herbert was VMI ’s
best golfer and an avid Notre Dame football fan.

Doyle said Herbert’s mother came to Lexing-
ton in the fall and got a hotel room so she and
Herbert could watch Notre Dame play A Florida
State. I I

“He was really thankful his mom did that for
him,” Doyle said.

Doyle said tragedies like this bring people
together. He said Herbert’s classmates are plan-
ning to do something for Herbert’s parents, but
nothing speciﬁc has been decided.

4 “People feel for the parent’s,” Doyle said.

Funeral services were scheduled held at 12:45
p.m. Thursday, January 20, at Fort Meyer Chapel,
with graveside service at Arlington National Cem-
etery, both in Arlington, Virginia.

, In lieu of flowers, the family requested that
donations be made to the American Heart Asso-
ciation in memory of Alex.

A Live Drive van sits idle, as it has for many weekends this year. Due to lack of drivers and decreased usage,
Live Drive has been available only rarely.

Live Drive hits the skids

By YABIZ SEDGHI
Phi Staff Writer

Live Drive, the Washington and Lee orga-
nization providing transportation to key des-
tinations on weekends, is in serious jeopardy.

“There are simply not enough people us-
ing it. No one calls anymore, there seems to
be a lack of need for the organization,” said
President Rebecca “Binky” Parkins.

“We had planned to start operating only
on ‘big party’ weekends, but it did not work.
The fraternities did not want to get involved.
They did not tell us their plans,” said Parkins.

According to Parkins, the demand for
Live Drive is limited because the fraternities
are required to have sober drivers.

“I think it is great that they have sober
drivers. They should be held responsible,”
added Parkins. “The sororities are also really
good about providing drivers, they always
take care of it.”

‘‘I’m sure the demand for Live Drive is
going to increase as more things start hap-
pening at places like Zollman’s. At the same
time, I think the organization should be used
sparingly,” said Pi Kappa Alpha President
John Paul Lunn.

‘‘I used Live Drive last year. I have not
this year because it has not been as noticeable
and there have not been as many parties,”
said one junior.

“We have also had problems with student
recruitment,” said Parkins.

In the past, the Student Conduct Commitee
assigned hours in Live Drive as disciplinary
action, he said.

“Live Drive is a very important part of
this community and-it has my full support,
but it is not a wise policy to require students
to work there. The organization should be
strong enough to support itself,” said Dean of
Students David Howison.

“Requiring students to work increases our
liability. It takes a lot of responsibility to
work for an organization like Live Drive,”

said Parkins. -

“Our main problem is lack of drivers.
Most of the volunteers are seniors; we have
no underclassmen support,” said Parkins.

“The number of female volunteers is
usually higher because they are required to
fulfill community service hours. Also, most
guys would volunteer at their own fraternity
if they wanted to be a sober driver,” said
Parkins.

“Money is not a problem. The Executive
Committee provides us with quite a bit of
money and we use most of it.”

“We used to have two vans, but since the
Outing Club van was trashed recently, we
only have one now. The van was donated
to the organization,” said Parkins.

“We are presently thinking about re-
structuring the organization to provide a
shuttle service,” added Parkins.

For now, Live Drive will be operating on
Saturdays between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.

For those needing transportation, the
number to call is 463-8947.

Students decide on housing‘

By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Staff Writer

lt’s the time of year for students to search for
places to live next year.

Dean of Students David Howison said approxi-
mately 40 percent of students live off campus while
60 percent choose on campus housing, including
fraternity houses.

Upperclass housing consists of Gaines Hall and
Woods Creek Apartments. Howison said Woods
Creek has three sections and provides space for law
and undergraduate students.

Howison said there will be a lottery for rooms in
Gaines. He said Dean of Freshmen and Residence
Life Dennis Manning is coordinating the lottery. It
will be limited to those students who are not cur-
rently residents in‘Gaines.

Howison said there are plans to renovate both
Gaines and Woods Creek Apartments. The Gaines
Revitalization Committee is considering sugges-
tions for improving Gaines, including the possibil-
ity of reserving five lofts for sororities and the
Women’s Forum. This would leave 11 lofts outof 16

for housing. He said he supports this idea because it will
attract more residents.

Howison said his recommendation must first go
through the budget process before being decided on
March 1.

Some students, such as freshman Tara Hebert, are
already attracted to Gaines. She said she plans to apply
for one of the four rooms which has only single-occu-
pancy rooms. '

“We don’t want to have to deal with an apartment,”
she said. “We want to be close to campus because we’re
lazy.”

Freshman Rachel Wright said she likes having easy
access to the campus and free cable. 1

“[Gaines is] not as bad as it seems,” said Wright.

Other students opt to live off campus. Freshman
Jenning Tran has begun looking for an apartment.

“I think living off campus would mean more freedom
and would be less expensive,” said Tran.

Roger Koehler, owner of Sweet Things Ice Cream
Shoppe, has two apartments above the store. He said the
two apartments weren't rented for next school year until
December. One apartment costs $450 a month while the
other costs $430 per month.

For fraternity men, there is another option for
housing——-the fraternity houses. Usually, sopho-
more fraternity members live in fraternity houses.

lambda Chi Alpha president Robert Ferris said
sophomores are assigned to the house and then a
lottery is held to select upperclassmen to live therg.
Ferris said four sophomores and six upperclass-
men live there now. .. A » 2

Sigma Alpha Epsilon President Jeff Laborde
said the house will have 16sophomores, one junior
and two seniors next year. He said the president
and the vice president have first choice and then
selection goes by class. 5

Sigma Chi president Richard Barksdale said
the selection process is determined by first term
GPA, which must be at least 1.9.

Kappa Sigma President William Aiken said
officers have first choice of housing and then
rooms go by class and GPA. He said the house
president and one other officer have to live there.
He said next year there will be 9 sophomores add
8 juniors.

According to a source in Manning’s office,

available for student residency.

Howison said he believes this arrangement to be
fair-, and he emphasized there will be adequate room

Keep off
the grass

FROM STAFF REi>oR1s

Students, faculty members, admin-
istrators and other visitors to campus
may have noticed that ropes restricting

. pedestrian traffic on the front lawn

have gone up once again.

The harsh winter weather Wash-
ington and Lee has recently experi-
enced is taking its toll on the front
lawn, according to Jim Arthur, super-
intendent of Buildings and Grounds,
and everyone is asked to stay off the
lawn until the weather breaks.

“The grass that was planted after the
irrigation system was installed this sum-
mer is very susceptible to damage as a
result of the bad weather we’ve had,”
Arthur said. “If we stay off the grass
until the weather breaks normal activ-
ity should resume in the early spring.”

Arthur urged pedestrians to use the
footpaths and to stay off the historic
front lawn.

“We really need everyone’s help on
this,” Arthur said. “If the grass remains
healthy through this bad weather, it
will come back fine in the spring. Then
it will be frisbees and football as usual.”

Mock Con
chairs
selected

FROM STAFF REPORTS

Mock Convention has selected three
designates as tri-chairs for the 1996
Mock Convention.

Pending confirmation by the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the Student Body,
sophomore Courtney Tucker will per-
form the duties of personnel chair,
sophomore Bob Ross will be political
chair and sophomore David Stewart
will be administrative chair.

“We’ve gone through an interview
process and we selected these three as
designates,” said Mock Convention
member Ted Elliot.

Elliot said the three tri-chair desig-
nates will present the plans for the
1996 convention to the EC, assuming
they are confirmed.

Koehler said people usually ﬁnd out about apart-
ments by word of mouth and fouror five people asked for
the apartment before it was rented.

there are 60 applications for Gaines, 5 for Woods

Creek and one application for the Outing Club
house. Applications are available in Payne 4 and
are due on Friday, January 28.

aquiring a glaze on it and was proving to be too fast for

tennis. None of theproblems were apparent at the begin-

ning.”

The Pavilion is getting a face lift — of sorts. _
The ﬂoor of the infamous site of concerts and sporting

activities is getting replaced.

O’Connell agreed. .
“When they first put the surface down, it met the needs
then, but increased use has taken its toll,” said O’Connell.

“It could have been remediedlwhen built; it is a construction

“The old one had gotten into a state of disrepair and was

becoming a problem as far as social use,” said Assistant
Athletic»Director George C. “Chuck” O’Connell. “When we
tore the ﬂoor up, we found that water vapor was coming up

and condensing.”

The floor in the Pavilion consisted of hard rubber cover-
ing a concrete base. When the building was used for certain
athletic events, a carpet covering was placed on top of the
rubber. The rubber portion of the ﬂoor was beginning to
bubble and separate from the concrete base.

The carpet is currently covering the concrete for both
social and athletic activity until the ﬂoor is replaced some-

time this spring or summer.

The Pavilion was constructed in 1984 to meet the needs

of the Student-Activities Board and the athletic department.

O'Connell

Capital Planning Coordinator Frank Parsons said “[the

Pavilion] had a strong appeal to President Wilson. He hoped
that concerts and student body dances could be held there,
relieving wear and tear on the Warner center, Doremus, and
Evans. He hoped fraternities would have joint parties there
and relieve some of the wear and tear on the fraternity

houses.”

The athletic department requested the replacement of the

ﬂoor.

Parsons said the ﬂoor “had a tacky surface that was

 

problem.”

O’Connellsaidintercollegiate
tennis and soccer use the Pavil-
ion for practice and, all outdoor
sports have the option to prac ice
there during inclement weather.
Intramurals and P.E. classes also
use the Pavilion.

“The problem is ﬁnding a ﬂoor
that is useful for athletic and so-
cial activities,” O’Connell said.

O’Connell and SuperintOn-

' dent of Buildings and Grounds
James Arthur are still looking at
possible floors.

“[The Pavilion] is a compro-

mise. It isn’t ideal for everything,” said Associate Dean of
Students Leroy “Buddy” Atkins. ‘‘I’d like to see us have
something in there where we can have people plajdng
tennis, soccer, or volleyball without having to take up the
floor for social events.”

O’Connell said the ﬂoor“should have been in now. It has

been delayed until spring or early summer because of

problems finding the right ﬂoor.”

Parsons said $47,000 is budgeted for the new floor.

Youth services program in danger
W&L MSA worked closely with Offices on Youth '

By ERIN LEONARD
Phi Staff Writer

Minority Student Association mem-
bers who volunteer with Lexington’s
Office on Youth program might need a
new organization to serve next year.

The state-bud-
geted program is not
in Virginia’s Fiscal
Years 1995-1997
budget, and Lexing-
ton would have to
spend another
$28,000 per year to
maintain the pro-
gram.

Sophomore Kyna
Bryant hopes the af-
ter-school and sum-
mer care programs
that the Office on
Youth supports sur-
vive.

“I just think a lot

 

Virginia’s 15-year-old Offices on
Youth program is funded primarily by
the state Department of Youth and Fam-
ily Services. The state’s 50 indepen-
dent programs serve 60 localities, and
the localities fund what the state does
not. Each is structured according to
local youths’ needs and is supervised

by a local citizens’
board.

The main services
that Lexington’s Of-
fice on Youth pro-
gram provides are the
after-school and sum-
mer care programs.
Director Tammy

' Merchant supervises
the two programs and
also addresses many
other needs of Lex-
ington youth. She
works closely with the
schools and other
youth—service agen-
cies in establishing

of the kids need a
place to go after
school,” said Bryant.
“We’re good role models, because the
kids get to see people who are in col-
lege. It gives_ them an incentive to do
better.”

Bryant

programs to prevent
juvenile delinquency,
substance, abuse,
dropouts and teenage pregnancy. Mer-
chant schedules guest speakers and puts
together pamphlets for area students.
She also serves on numerous local

boards representing the city’s young
people.

Despite its attributes, the state thinks
it can no longer maintain the program.
The state established Offices on Youth
in 1979 but has cut the program’s bud-
get in every year except 1993. Former
Governor Doug Wilder finally pro-
posed elimination of the $2 million per
year project in December.

‘.‘They just had to cut back, and that
was one ofthe things to be eliminated,”
said Merchant. “We’ve been threat-
ened with that ever since I started (in
1989).”

Merchant said she would hate for
Lexington kids to lose the program and
its volunteers. She agreed with Bryant
that the MSA members and Virginia
Military Institute cadets provide posi-
tive role models.

VMl’s Promaji clubasked the MSA
to begin volunteering with the Office
on Youth last fall. Through the term,
five to seven W&L students volun-
teered with the kids each day from 3 to
5 p.m.

“Just in the time we’ve been there,
we’ve seen a lot ofchange in the kids,”
said Bryant.

She said they play games fairly now
rather than cheating.

Although MSA has been active in

the program only since September, the

Office on Youth opened its doors in the .

Lylburn-Downing Community Center
in October 1989.

City manager Jon Ellestad said.’if
the program is cut, Lexington will lose
a lot.

“The things missed the greatest
would be the after-school and summer
programs for the youth,” said Ellestad.

He said if eliminated, he doesn ’t see
how the city could pick up the costsmf
the entire program. But, Ellestad said,
he hopes that enough money could be
funded to maintain the after-school and
summer programs. .

The after school program is free and
open to all school-age children. On the
average, 25 kids attend the program On
school days. The eight-week summer
program, however, has limited enroll-
ment and there is a $30 weekly fee.

Program coordinators throughout
the state are urging people to write
letters to Governor George Allen and
their state delegates. The support the
program is receiving from delegates is
strong, said Merchant, and she is de-
pending on Governor Allen.

“The people in the state level are
really positive that he’s going to rein-
state the funds,”she said, “I hope they’re
right.” .

Buckley, Chavis
to speak at W&L

By EMILY BAKER
Phi Staff Writer

. Washington and Lee’s Stnall SiZ_6
has not prevented it from bringing in
big-name speakers. _

Contact, a student-run organization,
is bringing several famous speakers to
W & L this year. NAACP President

enjamin Chavis and conservative col-
umnist William F. Buckley are sched-
uled to speak. Chavis is scheduled to
speak March 16, and Buckley s date
has not yet been set.

Eleven members approved by the
Executive Committee constitute Con-
tact, which holds meetings on Sun-

ys. . V '

“Our main goal is to provide speak-
ers for the W&L community, said
senior Matt Jackson, who presides Over
the organization with senior Andrew
Schneider.

The speakers must be “of contem-
ﬁirary interest, provacative, and pro-
vide dialog which is beyond the normal
scope,” said Jackson. _

The E.C. funds Contact’s entire
$38,000 budget, $8000 of which comes
from a speaker’s fund for the Minority
Students’s Association, Women 5 F0-

rum, and the Graham—Lee Washington
Literary Society.

“These groups give us requests and
we try to help them,” said Jackson.
Representatives of the groups attend
Contact meetings.

With a $38,000 budget, Contact can
not afford all speakers.

“The budget has limited us,” said
Jackson. “Some speakers are over our
entire budget.” Jackson mentioned Lee
Iacocca and Donald Trump as two who
will not be coming to W&L because of
cost.

Two other speakers are scheduled
for the next few'weeks. Thursday,
January 27, Mac Crawford of the Char-
ter Medical Corporation will speak on
“The Political and Business Implica-
tions of the Clinton Health Care Plan”.
Charter Medical Corporation is a group
of 80-90 hospitals, most of them psy-
chiatric. Crawford will speak at 8:00 in
room 327 of the C-School.

Thursday, February 3, Jeffrey Hart,
the Senior Editor of the National Re-
view , will give a speech entitled “The
University: Where We Are Now.”
Hart, a retired professor of English at
Dartmouth, will address his experi-
ence with the university and how to get

people who have to go in there and pay
for their food.”

Darrell said, at present, smoking is
permitted in the Co-op, the GHQ and in
the Dining Hall. '

“We don’t put out ashtrays (in the
Dining Hall),” said Darrell.

The EC gave mixed advice on the
proposed ban.

“It seems like the people in the Co-
0

op go in there to sit down, have a
cigarette and talk to people,” said EC
Secretary Ashby Hackney. “l have a
feeling that if smoking is banned, there ’s
going to be some kind of resistance.”

Junior EC Rep Alex Cross said a
smoking ban would “ruffle some feath-
ers.”

“I’m personally against it,” he said.

Second-year Law Rep Kevin Webb
and Junior EC Rep Carol Pierce said
they supported the proposed ban and
EC President Robert Tompkins said
the argument ‘against smoking in the
Co-op is a valid one.

“It is offensive to have to sit there
and smell the smoke while you’re eat-
ing your meal,” said Tompkins, “but I
hesitate to speak on behalf of the stu-
dent body.” »

FIJI asks Wilson for appeal extension

D FIJI, from page 1

Wolfe said Manning’s letterto SAC
contained misinformation and false-
hoods.

Wolfe would not identify the in-
correct portions of the letter. Howison
said he did not know of any inaccura-
cies in Manning’s letter.

Manning said the source of all in-
formation in the letter was former FIJI
pledge Jay Taggart.

“I put in writing what was told to
me,” said Manning.

Wolfe said FIJI believes the penalty
was too harsh because the incident
involved was minor.

“The pledges weren’t intoxicated
and they were not in any physical dan-
ger,” said Wolfe.

FIJI pledges will suffer the most
from the suspension, Wolfe said.

“The sophomores won’t have a
house. That’s generally one highlight
of sophomore year. They make the
transition, get out of the dorms and live
in the house. They all want to live here

and now they can’t.”
Wolfe said FIJI pledges could

depledge and pledge again at another
fraternity.

“But they’re all committed,” Wolfe
said. Under SAC’s suspension, FIJI
would not be able to hold Rush again
until fall 1995.Bishop said FlJI’s ap-
peal will be centered on inaccuracies in
Manning’s letter.

“There are substantive gaps between
the document and what we believe to
be the truth,” Bishop said. “Since there’s
only one truth, someone is wrong. And
truth has important implications, espe-
cially at W&L.”

Bishop said the house corporation

had already imposed sanctions on the
FIJI house when SAC made its deci-
sion. The house corporation put FIJI on
social probation until April and fined
the house over $5000 from their social
budget. The house corporation also in-
validated F IJ I’s officer elections.

“The people elected helped to pre-
cipitate the problem,” Bishop said.
“They shouldn’t be in a leadership po-
sition.”

Bishop said the house corporation
now controls the FIJI chapter, and has
the power to throw people out of the
fraternity.

Sigma Phi Epsilon is back in the top
seat after Saturday night’s Lip Synch
contest.

Sig Ep pledges billedas “Tool & the
Gang” won the 1994 Lip Synch with
their version of Kool & the Gang’s
“Celebration.”

Sig Ep took away the top spot, after
beating the Minority Student Associa-
tion, last year’s winners.

The 1994 Lip Synch competition
was held last Saturday at the Washing-
ton and Lee Pavilion.

Twenty-five acts were entered in
the event with prizes given out to the
top three groups. Receiving the third
prize of $50 was the Chi Omega Se-
niors with their version of “If” by Janet
Jackson.

Second place, a Fancy Dress ticket
and$50, was taken by the Minority
Student Association and their rendi-
tion of the hit “Whoot, there it is!”

As the winners of the 1994 Lip
Synch competition, the Sig Ep pledge
class won $100 and two Fancy Dress

tickets. .

Other acts that participated included
Sigma Chidoingtheirimitationof Blind
Melon and the “Bee Girl,” Pi Beta Phi
sorority doing “Wang Chung,” the
material girls of the Chi Omega pledge
class imitating Madonna.

According to Sophomore Susanna
Craib-Cox, “The highlight of the
evening was Doug Kaufman getting up
on stage and making a fool of himself.”

According to Lip Synch Chair-
woman Beth Provanzana, the event is
sponsored by a group of students every
year along with Gerry Darrell of Wash-
ington and Lee Dining Services.

The proceeds go to the Rockbridge
Area Relief Association, which dis-
tributes the ﬁnds to various causes
around the country. Money is also do-
nated to the local Multiple Sclerosis
Chapter.

Provanzana said none of last year’s
problems of people sneaking in and
backstage drinking occurred. There
were no complaints from the security
officers on duty.

Provanzana also thanked the volun-
teer staff that helped make the 1994
Lip Synch go so well.

Super Sunday is here!
Battle of the fans and their plans

BY BUNNY WONG
PHI STAFF WRITER

Tagged by some as the most important day of the year,

Super Bowl Sunday kicks in on the 30th.

Many W&Lstudents, however, aren’t that
enthused about the game.

“l could care less,” said freshman
Allison Foote, who will probably be
doing her homework Sunday.

For the uninitiated, the 1994
game will be the first in Super
Bowl history with a back-to-
back rematch.

The Buffalo Bills (who
won playoff games against

go up against the Dallas
Cowboys (who won a play-
off games against the San
Francisco 49ers, 38-21 ), just
‘ like last year.
Forthe Bills, it will be the '

The last three times they’ve '
lost.
Freshman Jenny Walton, _
from New York, hopes this ' '
won’t be a repeat of the last three

. years. _  V
“All I have to say is that at least Buffalo can make
it to the Super Bowl four times, even ifthey don’t win,”

she said.

Freshman Will Hill said he doesn't want either team to

win or lose.

"I want the Bills to lose to shut up all ofthe Bills fans, and
I want Dallas to lose because they're the favorites," he said.
Hill said he would rather be watching a movie than the

1 Superbowl on Sunday.

Another freshman, Neil Kelleter, said it has been a

tradition since he was five to watch the game.

Spirited as always, Evans Dining Hall is having a Dining
Service-USA Today Souper Bowl Contest. The D-Hall is
giving out contest forms with five questions. The contest is
being held both at the Co-op and the D-Hall.

Winners will receive a free bowl ofsoup every day forthe
following week. D-Hall winners will receive a $25 gift
certiﬁcate for the W&L bookstore, said Jerry Darrell, Direc-
tor of University Dining Services.

The five questions are:
1. Who will be the first player to
complete a pass?

including a pre-Super Bowl party with food in the fourth
floor lounge, said Katie Tollison.

“Everyone is welcome,” she said.

Most ofthe fraternities are having theirown parties, with
typical Super Bowl food — pizza, subs, beer. Some frater-
nity members were surprised to hear the Super Bowl was
coming up on the 30th.

The following is a list, in no paticular order, ofthe man‘

W&L student body.

2. A trip to Wzil-Mart.
for the essentials that you
need because the stock-
pile accumulated during
your parents’ last visit
ran out last week, is ari-
other option.

3. The Intramural
aerobics program takes
place on Sunday nights in
Doremus Gym. This is a
good way to ensure your

fitting into your dress or
tuxedo for Fancy Dress,
which is only five weeks away.
4. Bowling is another possiblity. The waiting

period for a free lane is likely to be short.
5. Studying is an option popular with the professors.
By studying, you can improve your grade point average.

Besides, you can always get the score from your friends
who did watch the game.

Noel Coward’s hilarious comedy of sophisticated wit and effects

By Melissa Sawyer
Phi Assistant Features Editor

lt’s not for Fancy Dress and it’s not a.seven-
ties party, but students have gone back in time
for another production. The Washington and
Lee production of Blithe Spirit opens on
February 4th for a seven day run.

The Noel Coward play was a hit of the
London and Broadway stages in the 1940s.
This popular farce is the story of Charles
Condomine, a widowed novelist in the post-
war era. Condomine, on a trip to his country
home with his second wife, hires a psychic to
. learn about the occult. The psychic contacts

Condomine’s first wife, who wants to be re-
united with him. After a series of mishaps,
Condomine’s second wife Ruth is killed in his
place in an automobile accident. The two wives
then return to haunt Condomine, and the way in
which he extricates himself from these two
“blithe spirits” forms the subsequent plot.

Guest Director Colleen Kelly is currently
associate head of acting and head of movement
and dance at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville. She is no stranger to the W&L
stage however. She choreographed A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum and
Evita, as well as the opening scenes for Romeo

. and Juliet.

Kelly’s work has not been limited to univer-
sity productions. She has choreographed fight
scenes for the New York Shakespeare Festival ’s
‘Tis a Pity She’s a Whore (1992), as well as for

the films Sommersby (1992) and Everybody ’s
All-American (1989). ,
C Senior Heather Aussiker plays Ruth,

Condomine’s second wife. Elvira, his first
wife, is played by junior Noelle Parrott, and
senior Jeff Mikita plays Charles Condomine.
Alison MacDonald, an exchange student from

‘Oxford University in England, plays the psy-
chic, Madame Arcati.

. The production involves several unusual
special effects, like the appearance of self-
moving furniture. Aussiker, who has appeared
in several other W&L productions including
The Flies andA F urmy Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum, said the demanding style has

_ presented a challenge to her.

‘ ‘‘We’re using a lot of trick props and break-
able stuff,” she said. “lt’s a lot like learning to
dance and then adding voices and lines,” she
said.

Heather Leonard, the lighting designer for"
the show, said the play has been challenging.
“The play’s a little more difficult than I’m

1 used to with lighting,” she said. “The audience
is on three sides of the stage.”

Noel Coward’s play Blithe Spirit is the next play in the Theatre Series. Pictured are Jeff Mikita, ’94, as Charles Condomine, Heather Aussiker, ’94, as Ruth
Condomine, and Noelle Parrott, ’95, as Elvira, the first wife of Charles. The play pokes fun at the high society of the 1930s. Numerous special effects complement
the humor of Coward’s plot, similar to those special effects of the orginal 1940s movie. The production opens on Feb. 4 at the Lenfest Center.

is directing a show for the upcoming One Acts,
said he “found it challenging for the first week
or so,” because he hadn’t done the acting style
before.

All of the actors play older, middle-aged
characters of the very upper-class, intellectual
set.

“You can’t move like you would normally
move,” Mikita. ‘‘I developed a learned tense-
ness. Once you have it down, you have to

remember not to fall into a relaxed state.”

MacDonald said she has little stage experi-
ence. She said she was persuaded by a friend to
try-out because she already has a British accent.
However, she said most of her character re-
volves around special effects.

“lt’s a question of energy more than any-
thing else really,” MacDonald said.

Coward’s characters each use very distinc-
tive language. Therefore, despite the play’s

many physical aspects, the actor’s speaking
remains an important element.

“You don’t play emotions — you play the
language,” Mikita said.

Mikita added he likes the rapid pace Coward
established.

This comedy dramatizes the high society of
the 1930s. Coward became successful for his
parodies of the establishment — the cocktail
party, cigarette-holder set.

Aussiker said it was hard to copy the Cow-
ard-produced 1946 film version of the play.
She said the cast and crew were limited by
having fewer sets.

“It has been very creative, blocking wise."
she said.

Blithe Spirit will be presented at Lenfest on
Feb. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 at 8 pm. and on Feb. (:

The American southwest arrives in Lexington this com-
ing week.

On Feb. 1 and 2 at the Lenfest Center for the Performing
Arts the Richmond Balletwill perform Rodeo, The Courting
at Burnt Branch.

The Richmond Ballet is celebrating it’s 10th anniversary
with Agnes De Mille’s famous piece Rodeo.

Rodeo is set to the lively and upbeat music of Aaron
Copeland. It captures the traditional Sunday afternoon when
the ranch hands gather to show off their roping, riding, and
throwing ability to their neighbors and the “womenfolk.”

Afterthe exhibition, everyone attends the evening dance,
where the cowboys ﬂirt all night.

Stoner Winslett, artistic director for the Richmond Ballet
said, “The theme of the ballet is pretty basic. It deals with the
problem that has confronted all American women and
which has never ceased to occupy them throughout the

. history of building our country: how to get a suitable man!”

The ballet is a favorite with the company because it is

more relaxed and as Brett Bonda, who has been with the
company for over nine years, said, ‘‘It is one of the few roles
where I can wear jeans and cowboy boots.”

Rodeo also allows Bonda to show off his tap-dancing
skills. Bonda appears in the ballet as the Champion Roper.

In addition to Rodeo, the Richmond Ballet will perforrr;

two other spectacular pieces.

Other Places is a dreamy, expressive piece written for
six couples. It was choreographed by Stoner Winslett in
1990 through an AT&T Foundation Grant. Other Places is
set to the lushy and romantic score of Dvoak’s Serenade for
Strings, Op 22. The actors will be wearing hand-painted silk
costumes designed by A. Christina Giannini.

The third piece is George Balanchine’sApollo. Apollo Q
the story of the god’s awkward beginnings and his develop-

Founded September 18, 1897

Live Drive Anyone?

Hey mom, I’m going out drinking with my friends tonight. Can
you or dad come get me?

Sorry dear, we’re just too busy. You’ll just have to wing it and
hope you find a ride. 8

Sounds like the most obnoxious parent on the planet, doesn’t it.
You also have to wonder how long it will be before that kid decides
to take a chance and try driving after having a few drinks.

Most people would be appalled if they heard an actual interac-
tion between a parent and child like the fictitious one above. But

. you would think it was less of a problem if you heard two college

students have a similar discussion. But, the effect is the same;
someone will go out drinking and because that person does not
have an assured sober driver they may take the chance of driving
themselves or getting in a car with another driverwho is not sober.
What is truly scary is that this is what we are doing to one another
right here at W&L.

Live Drive is in trouble. No one is volunteering. It once
operated every Friday and Saturday night and other big party
nights on request. Now Live Drive only operates on Saturday
nights. Seniors know Live Drive is something you. can take for
granted. Who needs to worry about how you’re going to get to
Zollman’s or how you’re getting back? Live Drive will take care
of it all. But we can’t just assume Live Drive will be there
anymore.

We have heard a lot of reasons for lack of Live Drive volunteers.
Students are just apathetic. They never posted any recruiting signs,
The fraternities do their own sober driving. Whatever the reasons
are, they shouldn’t matter. As a university community we need
Live Drive. It doesn’t matter if fraternities or sororities provide
their own sober drivers. Not everyone is comfortable asking a
fraternity or sorority ‘member for a ride, and besides, they only
provide sober drivers for their own members and guests. The need
for Live Drive still exists. It’s the lack of volunteers that are the

 problem.

So here’s your chance. We, just like most of the campus, took
Live Drive for granted. We will be the first to tell you none of us
have volunteered Live Drive. But, we would much rather take out
some time and volunteer than have to report a drunk driving
accident in any future edition of the Phi. So, we’re going to call
and volunteer. You should too. We’re only five people and won’t
make much of a difference without other volunteers.

Call Live Drive at 463-8947. There are no excuses.

Pavilion Renaissance?

Capital Planning Assistant Frank Parsons once said the casual
observer would not realize just how much went into the creation
of the Student Activities Pavilion, and he was right.

The Pavilion cost $677,000 to build and every year the student
body pays a portion of that debt, which will not be paid-off until
2003. Well, W&L is about to spend $47,000 more on the building.
Call it Pavilion Renaissance.

It seems the ﬂoor is bubbling and messing with the athletic

‘activity that takes place in the pavilion. It’s good W&L caresiso

‘ I ‘much’about-ath1etics;tliatiitéis‘willingitoreplaeea-floor th'at’s only

about a decade old." But $47,000? ‘ Honestly we don’t‘ ‘knew
enough about -floors to question whether the University is wasting
money or not, but that is a lot of money. When you walk on the
Pavilion ﬂoor it seems like just another gray ﬂoor. We assume the
next ﬂoor will look like a regular gray ﬂoor too. But we are told
it will be a better ﬂoor, and we believe it.

We have one request while the University is renovating the
Pavilion ﬂoor. Could they please renovate the acoustics of the
building too? After all, the Pavilion is supposed to be for both
athletic and social events. True, the acoustics are not as obvious
a bubbling ﬂoor, but students constantly complain about how bad
the sound is. Perhaps attendance at concerts and social events
would go up if the sound were better. Attending a concert in the
Pavilion is like visiting the Luray Caverns — you have to pay to
get in and things echo a lot. As a member of a band once told a Phi
staff member, “playing in the Pavilion is like playing in a tin can..”
After all, ﬂat metal surfaces tend to reﬂect sound and make sonic
diarrhea out of what would normally sound very pleasant. So, let’s
not end the Pavilion Renaissance at the ﬂoor. Fix the sound too.

We must preserve Roe v. Wade '

January 22 marked the 21st anniversary of Roe v.
Wade, perhaps one of the most controversial cases in
Supreme Court history. The decision has had an
impact on many fundamental aspects of American

‘ life, such as freedom of speech and privacy.

Before I discuss any of
the above, I would just like

to clear-up a pet peeve I
have with Pro-Lifers. The
appropriate title for those
who favor a woman’s right
to choose is Pro-Choice,
NOT Pro-Abortion. The use
of theterm Pro-Abortion
distorts what the Pro-
€hoi‘ée'ri‘lo‘vfeme‘nt is about.
Pro-Choicers can be those

against abortion personally, those who support it
unconditionally, or those who support it only in cer-
tain cases such as rape or incest; what all these people
have in common is the belief that a woman is the only
one who can decide what to do with her body.

Now that I have that off my chest, we can progress
to fundamental questions. One question is, of course,
who has jurisdiction, and to what extent, over a
woman’s body. Pro-Lifers say that the law has full
jurisdiction over a woman’s uterus. Pro-Choicers
would say no one has any jurisdiction over a woman’s
body. However, if we go a little further, Pro-
Lifers decide that theychave no responsibility to the
baby after it is born or to the mother who is forced to

carry it.

I have a few problems with this approach. First, it
is generally accepted in the medical profession that
proper nutrition, good emotional health of the mother,
and pre-natal care are necessary to produce healthy
babies. Often the people who seek abortions at free
clinics may not have access to information about
proper nutrition or to pre-natal care. As for emotional

health that is up in the air.

Imagine if you were a teenage girl and you had to
tell your parents you were pregnant. I don ’t think your

emotional state would be too great.

That is part of my second point: what happens to

 

The lower courts have
split on this question,
so obviously both sides
havesomevalidpoints.
I personally look at
these buffer zones as
similar to the ones
around polling places
during elections.
There is no cam-
paigning within a cer-
tain distance of the
building and the same
should be held true for
abortion clinics.

It might seem that

these mothers? The Pro-Lifers are certainly not look-
ing after them. Suppose the mother carries the baby to
term without proper nutrition or pre-natal care, the
baby is likely to be physically and/or emotionally
‘handicapped. Who is going to want to adopt these
babies? Certainly not the Pro-
Lifers. So these babies become
wards of the state without
homes, families, and for all in-
tents and purposes, a life. If any
Pro-Lifer can tell me how this
can be avoided, I would be glad
to listen to them. , , ,
. , Thenpthere ,is_the otheras; _.
pect of the abortion debateffree
speech."Pro-Lifer_'s' (and I real:
ize not all of you are part of
Operation Rescue) want to protest at abortion clinics.
This is fine if you don’t block people going into the
clinics and basically deprive them of their rights. The
Supreme Court in Madsen v. Women ’s Health Clinic
will decide the legality of buffer zones around clinics.

this column is a little irrelevant, considering the
anniversary was last week; however, abortion will be
in the news for a while longer. There is the decision
that must be reached in Madsen and in another case
detennining whether federal racketeering laws can
apply to clinic violence. There is also the FDA’s

cess to pre-natal care.

testing of RU 486, the French abortion pill, to
it can be legalized in the U.S. Finally, and pe
most importantly, abortion will be part of the h
care debate.
The health care debate will need to d
whether abortion will be covered under a h
plan or only in some cases, such as rape or i
will it be covered. There is also a questi
whether regulations or the national health car
will take supremacy over state laws. The healt .
debate will not yield a final answer on atsrtio
perhaps it will assist in answering some re
problems. These could include the availa

Morality extends beyond office‘

I write this article to oppose an
opinion that seems all too common
among my peers: that the moral con-
duct of public officials should not con-

given, may do anything with the power
he has.

What is more important, the people
themselves will be not inclined to re-

selves today, may break

but, for numerous reasons, which I
shall shortly give, it is an idea wholly
out of touch with political realities,
and, more importantly, one which can
only lead to the destruction of what-
ever public virtue exists in the
United States.

 First, the idea that an ofﬁcial’s per-
".??="sorraI conduct is irrelevant to his politi-

cal role is — apart from morality ——
factually absurd. In government, no
less than in civilized society, nothing
works outside of an atmosphere of trust.
The leaders of our government are ex-
pected to perform certain functions in
certain ways, and by accepting high
office they undertake to follow through
in this. If they lack integrity, then we
can never be sure that their work will
live up to our expectations. A man who
lies habitually, or who does not under-
stand the solemn trust that he has been

down in times of extreme stress. This
often happens in many Third World
countries, where the national leader-
ship is less admired (usuallyjustiﬁably
so) than it is here in the United
States. There can be no leadership with-
out trust.

Second, not only do corrupt prin-
ciples in the magistrate invite the col-
lapse of obedience and order, but they
also make inevitable an overall reduc-
tion in the moral soundness of society.
High officials, contrary to the notions
of many, are not merely functionaries
entrusted with the execution of a myriad
of practical tasks; they are also father-
figures, moral examples, and ambas-
sadors of the culture and nation they
claim to be a part of and to lead. In
Europe, recently, a government minis-
ter has become embroiled in a well-
publicized sex scandal, the result of his

having fathered an illegitimate child. *
The act in itself may or may not be
grounds for dismissal, but the situation
is complicated by the fact that the min-
ister in question has been an ardent
exponent of his party’s campaign in
support of “family values.” How can
such a campaign be respected by the
public if its proponents violate the very
principles they would have others ac-
cept? How can society respect itself, or
claim to have any integrity, when one
of its highest offices is held by such a
hypocrite? If a high official claims a
moral issue as important, then he surely
should be required to practice what he

preaches. but also

the government (abortion, income se-
curity, and crime, just to name a few)
involve value judgments that have to
be made; it is pure folly to insist that the
government can be run without refer-
ence to moral principles. Men like

George Washington and Robert E.
it goes without saying, were no
respected for what they did, but al
who they were, for “the content of
characters.” And in an age. suc

moral leadership on a national

grettable as it may seem, that le'

_Trek to Miniature Graceland

DREAM LAND
Richard Weaver

3 How does one deﬁne the word “dis-
turbing?” I thought about this for a
while and decided the only way to ﬁnd
out the answer was to continue the
Dream Land World Tour and investi-
gate Miniature Graceland in Roanoke.

That’s right, Miniature Graceland.
in 1986, Kim and Don Epperly turned
the yard next to their home in
residential Roanoke into a shrine to
Elvis Presley.

Jon, Rich, Andy, and I arrived on
the scene at Miniature Graceland last
weekend. We knocked on the front
door and listened to the Elvis Presley
songs that were playing over a loud-
speaker outside until Mrs. Epperly,
dressed in a T-shirt that said “I Miss
Elvis” opened the door and greeted us.
She said that Elvis songs play continu-
ously in her yard seven days a week.
gm Sundays Elvis’ gospel songs

e played.)

Miniature Graceland has 10,000 .

visitors a year, according to Mrs.
Epperly. The complex includes a min-
iature version of Elvis’ Graceland
home, the house he was born in, his
boyhood church, the museum of Elvis’

rs, his father’s house, and most
oddly, a miniature of the Roanoke
Civic Center.

Apparently Elvis performed in the
Roanoke Civic Center three times, and
in the miniature Roanoke Civic Center
there is a miniature Elvis dressed in a
rﬂiniature jumpsuit. Mrs. Epperly says
the miniature Elvis’ clothes are changed
almost every day, weather permitting.
The brochure says the miniature Elvis

is “playing, as always, to a full house”
in the miniature civic center. He is
surrounded by miniature band
members, “The Sweet Inspirations,”
all of which look like miniature
Tom Hesposes.

The Elvis miniature looked suspi-
ciously like a Ken doll which had some
sort of sidebum transplant. This re-
minds me: all of
M i n i a t u r e
Graceland looked
suspiciously like
convened Barbie
Dream Houses. If
that is true, one has
to wonder what
the Epperlys are

songs. And let’s not forget about the
new airport.” ‘

MR. AND MRS. ROBERT E.
GRADUATE: “Sorry, we’re Wayne
Newton fans. Got anything with a lot of
flashing lights and neon? And what’s
that about an airport?”

Mrs. Epperly told us of her plans to
add a miniature airport to Miniature
Graceland soon.
Her brochure says
that Elvis did not
actually have an
airport, but he did
own three air-
planes: Hound
Dog I, Hound Dog
11, and the Lisa

what I mean by

played in the yard.
What do these
peoples’ neighbors think?

MR. AND MRS. ROBERT E.
GRADUATE: We’re looking for a

baths, and a large kitchen.

a swimming pool and a view of a yard

definitely in a
“holding pattern,”
waiting to land.
“Buckle your
seatbelts, we’re
headed for Mem-
phis,”thebrochure
says about the up-
coming airport.

Mrs. Epperly did not speciﬁcally
mention any plans to establish a land-
ing pad for alien spacecraft for her
Martian friends.

Mrs. Epperly also told us about the
mayor of Roanoke’s recent proclama-
tion of “Elvis Presley Days” in honor
of the King’s birthday. The mayor ap-
parently attended a recent candlelight
service at Miniature Graceland in honor
of Elvis’ birthday. Doesn’t the mayor

of Roanoke have anything better to do, i

like perhaps, ﬁx the city’s chronic lack
of interesting things to do for people
under age 60? Anyway, Mrs. Epperly
said the mayor visited Miniature
Graceland even before he was elected,
so we can pretty much disregard the
theory that showing up was a cynical
attempt to gain popularity among the
inﬂuential Fans of Elvis voting group.

Andy asked Mrs. Epperly her opin-
ion on the whole Elvis U.S. postage
stamp controversy, and she really had
no preference between the fat or the
thin Elvis design. She also made
CLEAR to all of us that she believed
Elvis was not alive now. She said that
no member of the Presley family had
visited Miniature Graceland but
Graceland (I guess, more speciﬁcally,
“The Mother Graceland,” in Memphis)
was aware of its existence. Point of
Information: Mrs. Epperly has been to
the real Graceland 14 times.

It is once again time to postulate a
new theory, and here it is: Mr. and Mrs.
Epperly can make a lot of money by
licensing a chain of Miniature
Graceland franchises, sort of like
McDonald’s franchises. l’Il bet the city
of Lexington could make a killing for
installing a Miniature Graceland at the
city limits near the Virginia Horse
Center. Then a miniature Elvis could
buy miniature horses to give to people,
instead of giving Cadillacs. Then the
city could tax horses, instead of cars!

I’m looking for new destinations
for the Dream Land World Tour; if you
know of an unusual (or even better,
disturbing) place nearby I can investi-
gate, please call me at Phi World Head-
quarters at 462-4060. If you would like
to visit Miniature Graceland, call (703)
342-6025 for more infonnation.

A fifth sorority would help the system

To the editor:

I was appalled by the recent articles in the Phi and
Tie Trident on sorority Rush. It is unfortunate that Pi
Phi did not fulﬁll their quote; however, this indicates
to me that perhaps another sorority is needed.

There is a large number of W&L women who were

. released last year and this year. A number dropped
out, some did indeed“ fall through the cracks,” but the
majority were simply rejected from further consider-
aﬁon. The numbers which were quoted in The Trident
should reveal that another sorority is needed. If 163
women are rushing, with an acceptance of 108, that
leaves over 50 women in the cold. A ﬁfth sorority‘
would allow these women to join a sorority, even
‘though some will inevitably be released or will decide

to drop out.

gThese women now have the pleasure of watching
their friends and hall-mates being part of something
which they are not. I am uninfonned as to the condi-
tion of the freshman dorms this year, as I no longer

live there. However, if the door decorations which are
used this year are similar to the ones used last year, I
shudder at the lack of tact and thought that went into

making them.

fulﬁll their quota.

I cannot describe how it felt last year to walk down
the halls to go to classes or see a friend and see that
while sororities loved a number of my friends, they
were indifferent to myself. If decorations are needed
to identify pledges or to make them feel special, ﬁne.
However, there should be some consideration of
women who are denied this attention and how they

More freshmen and sophomores will have to go
A through Rush, thinking how wonderful it will be to
meet upperclass girls, the standard line fed out by Rho

Chis. They little realize that they will be attending
the longest, most uninteresting most important cock-
tail party of their life at W&L.

It is not the end of the world when you are

rejected from further consideration because your
clothes were wrong, or you didn’t meet enough
women, or because you weren’t making scintillat-
ing conversation because you already said your
name and where you were from 50 times to 50 girls.
It just feels like that, especially when you are

AIDS Project members disagree with Kucera

Tgthe editor:

As members of the Washington
and Lee University AIDS Education
Project we are bothered by the com-
ments of C.F. Kucera in the Jan. 21
edition of The Ring-tum Phi criticiz-
in the activities held in commemora-
ti ' of World AIDS Day. We began
this effort in an attempt to provide the
W&L community with critical infor-
mation for its health and future, as
well as to express our support and
compassion for members of the uni-
versity who have been personally af-
feaed by AIDS and HIV. Our activi-
ties on World AIDS Day were a ful-

ﬁllment of that mission.

Mr. Kucera questions our motives
for the Red Ribbon Drive and the Candle-
light Vigil held outside the Leybum Li-
brary. We question his understanding of
how deeply AIDS has affected this com-
munity. Many of the people involved
with the days activities, everything from
setting up displays and hanging posters
to wearing a ribbon and lighting acandle,
have lost people close to them at the
hands of this syndrome.

Equally important was the involve-
ment of those who have yet to be so
closely affected. Anyone on the campus
could participate in these reminders be-

cause AIDS is an issue that reaches all
of us. Rather than being an occasion
for “self-congratulation,” as Mr.
Kucera asserts, these activities served
as an excellent opportunity for the
AIDS project to commemorate and
inform. We achieved this through time
volunteered by students, and at mini-
mal cost (less than $25).

We believe that it was inappropri-
ate for Mr. Kucera to make assump-
tions concerning our personal motives
and group objectives, especially
since he has made no outward
attempt to gather information about
the AIDS Project.

Wrestlers third at invitational’

By STEPHEN WILLIARD
Phi Assistant Sports Editor

Wrestling is the arch-typical
individual sport. A team’s suc-
cess depends upon how each in-
dividual performs.

Last weekend, the Generals
faced ﬁve other teams in the
Washington and Lee Invitational
and wound up third.

Despite weather conditions
that prevented Haverford and

LaSalle from making it to Lex-
ington, the tournament included
six squads. The Generals had
two individual champions for the
first time since 1989.

Junior Eric Shriley won his
eighth-straight match in the 126-
class and sophomore Anthony
Raﬂa won the 134-pound title.

“We were pleasantly surprised
to have two champions,” said
head coach Gary Franke.

Eric Shirley was also pleased.
“That’s the best we’ve done

       

since l’ve been here,” he said.

Rafla’s victory was espe-
cially surprising, considering he
was originally not designated as
a starter.

To win the title he pinned
both of the top two seeds, and his
second pin came just 58 seconds
into the match.

The tragic fact, as far as the
Generals were concerned, was
that Raﬂa’s championship did
not net the team any points. Start-
ers must be declared in order to

score points, and Raﬂa was not
designated in time.

The championships were not
the only important matches of the
tournament, according to Franke.

“In a tournament like that, all
places are important for points,”
said Franke.

Steve Tye and Cole Van Nice
turned in second-place finishes
in the tournament. Adam Branson
and Colin Looney placed third in
the tournament for the Generals.

Eric Shirley started off the year

Senior Karen Stutzmann jukes her opponent in a contest at Doremus Gymnasium. The Washington and Lee University women’s
basketball team, with two wins over Sweet Briar and Mary Baldwin, have brought their record to 7-6.

with losses in his first four
matches, but has rebounded af-
ter moving down from 134 to
126 pounds.

“I really didn’t have the time
to cut wait during the fall,”
Shirley said.

Shirley has rebounded by put-
tingtogetheraneight-matchwin-
ning streak.

The next challenge for the
Generals comes this weekend in
a quadrangular against York,
Gallaudet, and Gettysburg.

Women head toward win column

By STEPHEN WILLIARD
Phi Assistant Sports Editor

New sports often do not get
the recognition that they deserve.
Often they are less than competi-
tive against more established
competitors.

In the case of the Washington
and Lee women’s basketball
team, however, this stereotype

ﬂies out the window.

The W&L women have
opened the year with a 7-6 record,
including wins in their last two
games against Mary Baldwin and
Sweet Briar.

In the Sweet Briar game on
Wednesday, the Generals held
the Vixens to 22 points on 22.6%
shooting from the ﬁeld.

The Generals did not fair much
better, shooting under 30% from

the ﬁeld themselves. However,
Washington and Lee forced 53
turnovers and out rebounded the
Vixens 51-37.

W&L placed three scorers in
double figures. Freshman Vir-
ginia Yoerg, the Generals lead-
ing scorer for the year, had 20
while Sandra Holmes and Nicky
Mayﬁeld contributed 12 and 10
respectively.

Yoerg was pleased with the

team}s performance thus far this
season.

“The season has been going
ﬁne,” said Yoerg.

The freshman has scored 20
points for the second consecutive
game against Sweetbriar.

Yoerg voiced respect for her
teammates.

“We don’t have the numbers
in terms of players, but we make
up for it with heart, and by work-

ing hard,” she said.

The next opponent in line for
the Generals is Davidson on Sat-
urday.

W&L could put themselves
two games over .500 for the year

* with a victory against the Wild-

cats of Davidson, which would
be quite an accomplishment for
a first year varsity sport.

AWAY GAMES
BY STEPHEN WILLIARD

The Superslaughter is upon
us yet again. To further hype
the hype, the Dallas Cowboys
and Buffalo Bills are playing a
rematch of last year’s torment-
ing 55-17 rout. My dream has
almost been realized: the Bills
are on the verge of immortality.

There is a catch point. In
recent memory (and with
Superslaughters, recent
memory goes back to the last
American Football Conference
victory; OK, so maybe not quite
that far.), therehave been few
instances of close, hard fought
games. In fact there have been
two. The 49ers beat the
Cincinnatti Bengals on a last
minute drive, and Scott
Norwood’s wide right field goal
cost Buffalo on its ﬁrst trip to
the Big Game. Coincidentally,
these were the only two games
played with only one week’s
break between the Conference
Championship and the
SuperS1aughter. Anyway, the
point is, maybe there will be a
close contestthis year. One can
always dream.

Basically, the premise be-
hind the week-off deal is this:
each team stays in its nonnal
mode. There is not the ex-
tended opportunity to allow the
media blitz to get to you (an 0-

fer by your conference in the past
several years certainly puts added
pressure on the AFC entry). With
the two week system, a team that
falls behind is quickly deﬂated,
providing the memorable blow-
outs of recent memory (with the
possible exception of that Bears-
Patriots game; the Bears would
have destroyed the Patriots at any
point in the season that year by
about the same score).

Out of all this comes the long-
awaited prediction. Given my
previous comments, most of you
already have some idea of what
the prophetic word will be. Here
you have it: Dallas by 35 in a
tight one. Ok, really I think that
there is just too much pressure on
the Bills, and Dallas is just play-
ing too well: Dallas by seven. I
do think that the Bills have the
potential to make a game out of it,
after their solid performance
against Kansas City. Onthe other
hand, didn’t the Bills beat the
Raiders 51-3 in a playoff game in
1991 ? Also, I thinkthatthe Cow-
boys are a little stronger than the
Chiefs.

Yes, there are other sports
going on right now. College bas-
ketball has a new target at num-
ber one this week with the Uni-
versity of Southern California at
Los Angeles Bruins making their
first appearance in that position
since 1983. Duke garnered the
number two spot and the number
one spot in the Atlantic Coast
Conference by defeating the Uni-

versity of Virginia and Florida
State. UCLA put in an impres-
sive performance against Arizona
to make it’s case for the number
one spot.

In the National Basketball
Association,things happened. It’s
just not quite as interesting with-
out Mr. Jordan there to rewrite
the highlight ﬁlms every couple
of games.

Parting Shots-

Leon Lett: Try bringing your
brain to the game this time. Maybe

Long-awaited ‘Superslaughter’ pick

the Dolphins game taught you
something. Nah, that would
involve some sort of organized
thought.

The Buffalo rallyingcrythus
far has been, “Let’s p*** em
off.” That’s great, and I wish
the best of luck to the team, but
everyone else IS going to be
pretty p****d off if you guys
lose one more time. «

In the Austrailian open,
Steffi Graf has been winning
everything in sight. You know,

for the sake of competition, it
would be interesting to see
her lose every once in awhile.
Monica come back!

Also in the Down Under
Grand Slam,butonthe men’s
side, things seem to be mov-
ing once again towards a
Sampras- Courierﬁnal. Once
again, haven’t we seen this
show before?

My ﬁnal message goes out
to Mr. Jordan: DON’T TRY
TOPLAY BASEBALLIII!

Franke reports that his team is
showing wear.

“We’re a little banged up right
now,” said the coach.

In fact, the Generals have suf-
fered injuries to captain Adam
Williams (will not participate this
weekend because of a broken
thumb) and sophomore Cole Van
Nice (questionable with a re-ig-
jured knee). According to
Shirley, however, Van Nice will
probably be back in action this
weekend for the quad-meet.

Swimmers
drop two
difﬁcult

meets

BY STEPHAN WILLIARD
Phi Assistant Sports Editor 9

Sometimes there is a limit to
everything.

The Washington and Lee
swim team might have stretched
their limits last Saturday, Jaﬂ.
22, against Johns Hopkins and
Emory University in Chapel Hill,
North Carolina.

The Generals lost to two of
the strongerteams in Division III
during the day’s competition.

Coach Kiki Jacobs said tlt:
competition was unusuallytough.

“Emory and Henry and Johns
Hopkins, for women, usually
place in the top eight in nation-
als,” she said.

She also said that the team
performed better than in they 
in the same meet last year.

Travelling time did not seem
to be a problem for the Generals.

Actually, accordingto sopho-
more Rebekah Prince, the away
meets are beneficial.

“It’s actually kind of nice‘o
get a change of scenery for a
while,” she said.

Despite the distance and the
somewhat disparaging results,
the team members had one of
the better meets of the year, set-
ting numerous season and pgr-
sonal bests.

Washington and Lee also got
two individual wins from fresh-
man Staci Bertelli in the 100 and
200 butterfly. Thevictories were
the only two individual wins for
the Generals.

The team faces what .lac&)s
called “the most competitive
meet ofthe year” this weekend
against Franklin and Marshall.

Prince said she is looking for-
ward to next wcekend’s meet.

‘‘I’m really excited about this
weekend,” said Prince. 0

The Generals are preparing
for a meet that, according to
Jacobs, could go either way.

The following weekend sees
the Generals facing a Mary Wash-
ington squad that placed fourth
in nationals last year. The lvhry
Washington team is bringing in
a strong freshman class. Con-
ference meets begin again early
in Febraury, starting with
Hollins College.

“So far, the season has gone
really well,” said Jacobs. 0

The team has returned from
a 25th place finish at last
year’s nationals.

Prince, an All-Amwrican,
has been one ofthe teams lead-
ers this season despite being
under the weather for mos,t.of
the season.

“To come in as a freshman
and be an All-American and
come back the next year is really
hard,” said Prince.

The Generals carry an air of
deserved confidence conce;n-
ing their conference meets, de-
spite last weekend's losses out
of conference.

When mentioning the upcom-
ing Hollins meet, coach Jacobs
was positive.

“ We shouldn’t have a pr‘3b- »

lem with it,” she said.
Prince was also confident.
“If we don’t win l’ll be sur-
prised,” she said of the confer-
ence meet against Hollins.
The Generals have three more
meets this term before the ld
Dominion Athletic Conference
Championships Feb. 18-20.
These will be combined with the
-Atlantic States Championships,
at the Southern States Champi-
onships.
