Everyone loves a carnival...

What a sport! Despite numerous attempts by freshmen and dining hall employees to dunk Dean
of Freshmen and Residence Life Dennis Manning, he remained high and dry. Finally, he took
pity on their weak arms and ineptitude and jumped in by himself. Evans Dining Hall sponsored
a “Carnival Night” Thursday as a benefit for KidsPlayce. Hundreds of students attended the
event, and left full of carnival fare such as cotton candy and pretzels.

EC selects Mock 

Convention Board

 

By MICHAEL HEWLETT
Phi Staff Writer

The 1996 Mock Conven-
tion will not begin for another
y r or so, but plans are al-
ready underway for the tradi-
tional event. In the past, the
Washington and Lee Mock
Convention has gained a na-
tional reputation for correctly
selecting the Presidential
ngninee for the party out of
0 ice. The Convention’s pick
has gone on to be chosen by
the National convention in 10
of the last 11 election years.

Mock Convention Execu-
tive Board members have al-
r ady been chosen: Bob Ross,
P litical Chairman; David
Stewart, General Chairman;
Courtney Tucker, Personnel
Chairman; Tom Becker, Sec-
retary; and

in the winter.

Ross said the State Chairmen are
responsible for conducting research
in their state by networking and send-
ing out polls to people. The Re-
gional Chairmen work with the Po-
litical Chainnan to bring all of the
research together. Together, the five
Regional Chairs comprise the Cre-
dentials Committee, the group ulti-
mately responsible for predicting
the Republican presidential nomi-
nee. Ross said the Mock Conven-
tion primaries will be the first week-
end in March, 1996 before the real
primaries on the following Tues-
day. Ross said there will be a Spring
Kickoff in ‘95 and the Presidential
Gala in fall ‘95.

Brown said the Mock Conven-
tion will probably cost $250,000 to
$300,000. He said besides the edu-
cational budget, the Mock Conven-
tion has the largest student-run bud-

the Finance Chairman will work
in conjunction with the Alumni
Chairman to send letters to
alumni, asking for donations. He
said this usually raises $20,000.
He said the Presidential Gala
raises money for the Mock Con-
vention.

Stewart said the Mock Con-
vention has two main commit-
tees: the Executive Board and
the Steering Committee. He said
the Executive Board meets sepa-
rately from the Steering Com-
mittee.

Tucker said her main respon-
sibilities will be to coordinate
tasks for the members of the
Steering Committee and make
sure things work smoothly. She
said she works on the non-politi-
cal end.

Ross said an Advisory Board
is also being formed. He said

pieces donated by others.
From antique Khoton rugs to Ming Dynasty lamps,

Elizabeth Otey Watson, benefactor and friend

of the university, died Saturday.

Watson spent several weeks in Lynchburg’s
Virginia Baptist Hospital before losing her battle
with a reoccurring illness, said Reeves Center

Director Thomas Litzenberg.

In 1968, Watson began to work with the
Reeves Center and the university, a relationship
that remained strong for the rest of her life.

“The loss of Elizabeth Watson is the loss of a
dear friend of this university of a quarter of a

century,” said Litzenberg.

“Her love of the university was only sur-
passed by the love of her husband and that more
than anything explains her proposal [of] a lasting
memorial in his name,” said Litzenburg.

Dr. James Whitehead, former Reeves Center

Director agreed.

“What impressed me as much as anything
about her [was that she] loved W&L,” Whitehead
said. “She was very close to the university for

many years.”

Watson would often help Whitehead identify
East Asian pieces and generally enhanced the
education of art majors here at W&L.

“She could relate to any age group . . . she was
enriched by [the students] as we were enriched

by her life,” Whitehead said.

Her contribution to the university culminated
this past fall with the opening of the Watson
Pavilion. The pavilion houses a vast collection of
East Asian art including Watson’s collection and

In 1946, Watson married the late William Watson,

Canton, China. He was working for the Standard Oil
Company at the time.
It was there that Watson began to collect seri-

ously, furnishing their apartment with East Asian art.

Political turmoil in China in 1949 forced the

A sudden wind, rain and hail storm surprised one of the university’s athletic vans and not a few
students early Wednesday afternoon. The storm downed several trees on campus, including this
large oak. Fortunately, the crushed van was the university’s oldest. The newest van survived

unharmed nearby. Expect the weekend to bring more clouds and rain with highs in the mid 70's.

Schindleris List provokes contemplation and sorrow

By KIRK SusoNo '

Phi Movie Reviewer

 

Schindler ’s List ~— Four Stars

If you are like me, you probably thought that
Schindler’s List would be a depressing and
overly long movie.

However, after it won a gizillion Oscars,
you felt you ought to see it to be a cultured
American.

Well, it turns out you were right on all three
counts.

If you haven’t seen this film, you ought to.

“But wait, Kirk —— I will not bow down to
the cultural fascists in this country who demand
that I see every sad and pretentious black-and-
white film some Hollywood author manages to

roduce.” Well, I'm not suggesting that, either.

This film is genuinely good in its own right
and seeing it would make it easier for you to
carry on a decent cocktail party conversation.

Schindler ’s List manages to bring some of
the horror, sadness and ghastliness of the Holo-
caust to the screen.

We see the camp commandant (played by
Ralph Fiennes) shoot prisoners from hundreds
of yards away with a high-powered riﬂe, ran-

realize how (Tliere’s always MTV.) maid, forwhorn
lucky my life he has developed
has been, an affection.

Considering all our talk at this school about
rzoblesse oblige, it would be hard to find a more
moving example of that than Oskar Schindler’s
actions.

This is heightened by his emotional speech
at the end of the movie, when he finally con-
fronts and realizes what he has accomplished
(and what his fellow Gemians have done).

Schindler ’s List, however, isn’t simply a
grim statement of horror (51 la Faces of Death);
there are more intricate and interesting points
this film makes.

One of them is the inherent dichotomy of
man, manifest here in the German people.

The similarities between the camp comman-
dant and Schindler are remarkable.

Schindler hints at the commandant’s inter-
est in one scene, where Schindler kisses her on
the forehead. _

Later, we anticipate that the commandant
will kiss the maid, romantically; instead he
severely mauls her, mad that he has fallen in
love with “Jewish vermin.”

Near the movie’s end, the commandant in-

PAGE 3

tends to shoot the girl, believing this is the best
way to save her from the inferno at Auschwitz.

That a quick death in the woods is preferable
to the death camps seems reasonable (l),

‘ until Schindler presents an alternative which

allows her to live.

This is an alternative that the commandant is
reluctant to accept.

It is easy to see Schindler and the comman-
dant as two sides of the same coin; one kisses
out of love, the other hits her in an anger
inspired by such a love.

Both are initially ambivalent about the Jews,
but one falls into the side of history (and righ-
teousness) and the other into an early death in a
noose.

I began to wonder what small differences
would result in that sort of change.

Though this movie has its drawbacks (a
sleep-inducing pace, Spielberg’s penchant for
ﬂat, “wanted poster” close ups), it has many
good points, such as the fine supporting cast
and John Williams‘ sentimental score.

Certainly the central attraction of the ﬁlm is
its heartening message, though how much of
that is owed to the theme as opposed to_
Spielberg’s artful directing is questionable.

The scale of the Nazis’ evil makes one
wonder whether it would be possible tocreate
a.ﬁlm about the Holocaust which didn’t touch
the heart. I

At any rate, this film does.

  Music and theater come together in opera

COMPILED FROM STAFF REPORTS

It has been thirty years since the music and
theater departments at Washington and Lee
"have joined hands to present a fully staged
opera.

May 20 is the opening night for Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart’s comic masterpiece, The
Marriage of Figaro.

One‘ of the reasons for putting on The
Marriage of Figaro is to showcase the abun-
dance of singing talent at W&L.

These include Jennifer Ray ’94 (Susanna),
Mandy Irons ’95 (Marcelina), Allen Flickinger
’94 (Bartolo), Michelle Brien ’94 (Barbarina)
and Meagan Miller’96 (Countess Almaviva).

“Without this kind of talent, we couldn’t
even think of producing anything as sophisti-
cated as an opera,” said Dr. Gordon Spice,

_ chairman of the music department and musi-
cal. director for Figaro; I  < -—, 1

Besides W&L voices,’ the audience will
also be hearing Larry Evans as Figaro. Evans
is a professional singer and Lexington resi-
dent and has sung over thirty operatic roles.

”Larry is a joy to work with,’ said Spice.
”He brings a professional air to this produc-
tion and his presence at rehearsals has been
inspirational to the students. He's brought
Figaro to life for them-they're seeing beyond
the notes to how the music and the drama work
together.’

The Marriage of Figaro is based on the
satirical French comedy by Beaumarchais.
The audience sees Figaro and Susanna on their
wedding day.

“It’s one of the first operas to present its
characters as normal people who experience
the same kind of emotions we do, especially
on the subject of love,” said Dr. Spice.

Opening night is May 20, featuring W&L
senior Jennifer Ray as Susanna, with addi-
tional performances on May 22 and 24.

All perfomiances begin at 8 p.m. in the
Keller Theater.

For ticket information, call the Lenfest
Box Ofﬁce at 463-8000 from noon to 4 p.m.

Twenty years ago this week, the big news in The Ring-
tum Phi was Washington and Lee’s televised lacrosse win
over the “Wahoos” of UVA. The Phi reported that the
crowd of 10,000 was the largest ever to see a lacrosse game
in the state of Virginia. Saturday morning classes, how-
ever, kept some W&L fans from the first minutes of the
6 game in Charlottesville.

The International Streakers Association had an ad for
“streakers” t—shirt, but a front page story gives the details
of a W&L student’s $100 fine for indecent exposure in
Lexington.

For entertainment, the junior class was sponsoring a
dance in Red Square, “The Last Sock Hop.” Ads pro-
‘ moted “the first annual Cherry Blossom Music Festival”
in Richmond with 15 bands over two days, including the
Steve Miller band and Kool and the Gang, while the top

two movies were The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid.

Three different stories mention “town-gown” relations
between W&L and Lexington, which were apparently not
at their best.

Thirty-five years ago this week, W&Lwas preparing to
host a journalism conference for high school students,
three-fourths of whom were “members of the female
gender, a fact which has never failed to delight the Wash-
ington and Lee gentlemen” of the day.

One girl told the Phi, “I wouldn’t date aboy who drank.
I’ve heard remarks about fraternities and we’re not al-
lowed to even go near them.”

But another girl said, “Last year we didn’t meet any
boys at all, but this year we’re going to get out and meet
some boys if we have to lock our adviser in the bathroom!”

WLUR-FM rocks through spring term

Sounding in with spring term comes the new directors .

and assistant directors for WLUR-FM, Washington ‘and
Lee’s radio station.
W&L’s FM frequency offers something for every musi-
cal taste, including country, classical, rap, rock, and reggae.
“The most popular kind of music among the students is
alternative,” said Chief Operator Becky Crow. Though

alternative may be popular, disc jockeys can pick from any
of the selections the station owns. '

“We have a pretty extensive library,” said Becca Reed,
previous director of the dance/rap department. This variety
of music allows DJ ’s to broaden their musical horizons. ,

“Working closely with the radio has helped me keep
track of new bands,” said Crow. ‘‘I get to hear about them
before most people do.”

Radio can have other advantages, also. ‘‘If you like the
music you’re playing, you can have a lot of fun,” said Reed.
“It can be like your own dance party in the DJ booth.”

Deejaying a show, however, is not always a party. The
initial adjustment to speaking to an audience can be intimi-
dating.

“At the beginning some people are really quiet on the air
and don’t say much. But most get talkative after a while,”
said Crow.

The Student Voice of Washington and Lee
Founded September 18, 1897

All together now

Oh, Horrors, class registration is approaching
again... ‘

After a nightmare spring term registration, many
freshmen become apprehensive about ever getting the
classes they desire.

The lucky ones have upperclassman friends in
each department in which they wish to register, who will
give the inside info into exactly how early to get up and
which days the secretaries will allow each class to register.

Then the young registree must discover who is
qualified to sign the registration form; must one search out
the professor and skip classes to wait by his door for his
office hours, or will an initial from the department secre-
tary suffice? ~ In

We have assessed a very clear problem with Wash-
ington and Lee class registration: inconsistency.

Even if a student becomes intimately familiar with
the ins and outs of registration in his major department, he

I will have to start all over again if he ever ventures out of
J the department into the great unknown of general educa-

tion requirements and —- God forbid — electives!
Physical education registration is, if not perfect, at

 least better than anything else because the necessary
 preparation (getting up before the birds) is clearly stated

and does not change from term to term.
At such a small liberal arts university as this, it

’ would seem practical to have a universal registration

procedure, for inter-departmental fairness if nothing else.

Knowing that every department required one to
wait in the hallway before dawn, or had certain designated
days for each class, et cetera, would relieve much of the
stress of simple ignorance of departmental policy!

Even if every department published a registration
policy and stuck to it unwaveringly, things would go much
more smoothly. But, as it is, many departments give
special dispensation to majors, or advisees, or  the list
goes on. V

The only fair solution is to either establish a consis-
tent university-wide policy or to publish and conform to a
written policy in each department.

For in_s_tance, the_,,urtivegs:rty.§r;qniri:f_9lL9yyxtti.t; ex-
ample of the history department, ‘wh'ich”has“ a "unified
policy which is clearly posted each registration period.

' After all, we are not rocket scientists!

Party loyalty limits political protests

Since this is spring term, I guess I should be writing the middle. Neither party can really stray to far in
either direction and maintain its voting base. Then the
governing party is attacked for
being too centrist and giving
into the whims of the other party.

about something that requires no serious thought.

‘Unfortunately, I can’t
think of anything fun due
to all the work I’ve had to

do for class.

Lately, I have been
thinking about party loy-
alty (i.e. Democratic, Re-
publican, Green). Actually,
it has been a topic on an
Internet debate on whether
or not progressive groups
should stage a protest at

the 1996 Democratic convention. The consensus was
~. that thereshouldibe‘ a protest, but we disagreed on the
 extenﬁof'th6?prbtestt,Kt;‘J9...      j .
' There was indecision about whether to protest
speciﬁc policies of the Clinton administration or the

Democratic party as a whole.

Most of the participants were for the later option;
however, after thinking about it for a while, I decided
the first option was probably better. I had personal as
well as practical reasons for this decision. On a
personal level, my family are New Deal Democrats-
blue-collar unionists. My grandfather was even a
Teamster during Hoffa’s reign. I think there is some-
thing in the blood that prevents us from voting any-
thing but Democratic; so naturally, I don’t want to

turn against the party.

Now for practical reasons, I think many of the
problems the group has with the Democratic party
might not be so prevalent if there were more party
loyalty. A major complaint was about how hard it is
to distinguish between the Democratic and Republi-
can parties. That is certainly true, after all both parties
are going for the same undecided group of voters in

 
 
 

So how would increased
party loyalty change that? For
one thing, a party would de-
velop principles because they
would have a solid base of vot-
ers. I’m sure someone will raise
the objection that if there is a
solid base that follows the party
line, then there will be no de-
bate; everyone will just blindly follow the party

leaders. I think the oppo-

~ site is true — there will
be more debate since the
course of the party will
not immediately be clear
or obvious.

Debate will be re-
quired no mater the loy-
alty of the followers.
Think of it in more per-
sonal terms. When you
are with friends, you are
more like yourself then
when you are with a

~ group of strangers. A po-
litical party acts the same
way. With trusted mem-
bers itcan become some-

thing that has actual val- -
ues and beliefs to uphold.

, There are times when determining what position to
take to remain loyal to the party can be a problem. For

the protest.

example, during the North Amercan Free Trade
Agreement debate, was one loyal if you supported
NAFTA along with the president or if you opposed
to it along with the majority of Democrats in the
House and the unions? Then there is a case of one
our own, Senator Warner, who has basically ﬁe-
fused to endorse Oliver North for the Senate. Can
he be said to be opposing the party when theparty
itself is divided. One group supporting Dan Miller,
the other, led by another alum, Pat Robertson,
backing North.

We still haven’t decided what sort of protest we
should have. It may depend on where the Conv3n-
tion is held. If it is in Chicago, we may go all out to
remember the ’68 convention and the riots and

. , beatings that tookplace
at a different Demo-
cratic convention when
a different Daley was
in office. ‘j

I rather doubt many
of you are going to go
out and organize a pro-
test, but I hope all of
you will think about
who and what you are
voting for during
the primaries.

Virginia has not yet
decided who will be the
party nominees for the
State, and the result is
bound tobe interesting.

I know it is spring

term, and summer is fast approaching (not Son

enough!) but exercise your brains a little when
you are voting.

There’s more to Nixon than Watergate

I have always admired Richard
Milhous Nixon.

himself, “For that reason, I long ago

tional sense. Richard

He was, to be honest, a very ﬂawed
man; he could be petty, vindictive,
even criminal. .

So at the risk of undermining what
should be a sympathetic account of
Nixon’s life, let me first address the
question that begs to be asked; the
question of Watergate.

Nixon says, “What happened in
Watergate — the facts, not the myths
—— was wrong.”* Though Nixon de-
nies any prior knowledge of the break-
in at the Democratic National Conven-
tion Headquarters in June, 1972, on
the wider question of his responsibility

‘for the conduct of his officials, and of

his culpabilityin the cover-up that fol-
lowed, Nixon admits fault, ‘‘...I should
have set a higher standard for the con-
duct of the people who participated in
my campaign and in my administra-
tion. I should have established a moral
tone that would have made such ac-
tions unthinkable. I did not.”

Of course, Nixon was hardly the
first president to be involved in shady
dealings; Lyndon Johnson probably
obstructed justice ten timesbefore
breakfast. Nixon understood this, “Not
taking a higher road than my predeces-
sors and adversaries was my central
mistake.” But, of course, the excuse
that “they startedit” hardly removes

Nixon, however, is bigger than
Watergate. What, we might ask, is his
greatest legacy?

I want to suggest that it was some-
thing Nixon liked to call “practical
idealism.” Richard Nixon, more than
any other president in the post-war
period, had an ingenious grasp of the
relationship between means and ends
in politics. His end, his goal, was clear

‘enough; it was essentially anti—com-

munism. Nixon felt acutely the threat.

posed to Western freedom by commu-
nism, and his entire political career
was devoted to its defeat. This kind of
single-minded idealism would make
Nixon extremely unpopular with some
Americans, those too buried in relativ-
ism to see the threat of communism for
what it was; imperialistic tyranny of
the worst kind.

But the genius ofNixon was notjust
in realizing what the goals ofhis politi-
cal life should have been (the defeat of
communism and the expansion of free-
dom); Nixon also displayed an extraor-
dinary skill in bringing his ideals into
practice. Take his opening to China in
January, 1972 as an example. The
naive might ask how one of the West’s
greatest enemies of communism could
journey to a communist power like
China in order to improve relations.

Isn’t that hypocrisy?

The answer, of course, is that Rich-
ard Nixon did more damage to imperi-
alistic communism by shaking Chou
En-I.ai’s hand in Beijing than he could
have done by any other means. Nixon
understood the growing rift between
China and the Soviet Union for what it
was: a golden opportunity for the United
States to drive a wedge between com-
munist powers and help to ensure their
final defeat in the Cold War. This is
why we call Nixon a practical idealist:
he used practical means to achieve
idealistic ends, and he did so brilliantly.
Anyone who ap-
preciates the rela-

OPINION

Many secrets lurk at Stop-In

DREAM LAND
Richard Weaver

Today is April 28, and you know
what that means! It’s time for the next
stop on the Dream Land World Tour.
This week I took a Phi expense account
trQ> to the Stop-In convenience store
on Main Street to investigate the news-
worthy effects of packaged pseudo-
food on W&L students.

The Stop-In clerks,“Bill”and“Don”
were pretty informative. Among other
things they revealed to me that the
umold world famous Stop-In hot dogs
are disposed of after about two hours
on the rolling grill.

“At the end they look like shriveled
raisins,” Bill said. He did not say what
they looked like before.

According to Bill’s estimate, one
ha f of all Stop-In hot dogs are con-
verted to chili dogs by the customers
before they leave the store.

“I like the chili dogs,” said Stop-In
customer Tricia Coughlin, a broadcast
journalism major from Babson Park,
Florida. That’s T-R-I-C-I—A C-O—U-
G-H—L—I-N. Be sure to mention to her
thgt you saw this.

“She likes to get them all over her-
self,” said her friend.

Bill was not sure of the ingredients
of Stop-In chili.

“I think it’s just a concoction of

chili beans and seasoning,” Bill said.

Bill and Don were both unable to
explain the packaging of the world
famous Stop-In microwaveable cheese-
burgers. Each burger has a label that
features a line that says “Prepared by
Wayne” or “Prepared by Kathy” or
“Prepared by Robert.” Bill and Tom
did not know who

have to come over to the other burger
makers’ houses and make some idle
threats about their dog’s life if they
didn’t leave his share of the cheese-
burger business alone. Whole Stop-

LETTERS

Annual Fund collection misjudges seniors,

The Radio Guy
is a Lexington resident who enjoys
music and carries a large radio with
him wherever he goes, sharing his music
with the people.

“We don’t allow him to sing in the
store,” Don said, emphatically. The
Radio Guy is sent outside to sing.

Stop-In has also served such celeb-

rities as actors Sam Watterston and
Sam Jackson, who were making a ° 0 -

has also been sighted at Stop-In, though
rumors that he is the Radio Guy cannot
be corroborated.

I did speak with one Stop-In cus-
tomer who was not very happy.
Catherine Bassett told me that she found
Stop-In donuts to be “all sticky and
unnatural.” Catherine’s boyfriend,
Chester “Andy” Holden also com-
mented that Stop-In featured salsa in
mild and medium variations, but not
hot. I guess competition from Taco
Bell muscled out Stop-In hot salsa.

Mike Harden was impressed by
Stop-In’s selection of motor oil in the
windows. This is probably a good time
to repeat that Bill was not sure of the
ingredients of Stop-In chili.

And beyond the usual assortment of
food, drinks, cigarettes, and motor oils,
Stop-In also happens to carry toy Exxon
trucks.

“I hate those trucks,” Bill said. Ap-
parently they have not sold well. It’s
surprising that Stop-In does not carry
toy Stop-In trucks, or toy hot dogs, or
any other souvenir Stop-In items. Don
says they used to have Stop-In lighters,
but they sold out.

“Not many people ask for Stop-In
stuff,” Don said.

I strongly urge you to go down to
Stop-In and ask Don and Bill lots of
questions about the store. They like it.

° makes them less willing to give later

To the editor:

I would like to call your attention to the collection
methods currently used by those in charge of Wash- -

ington and Lee’s Annual Fund.

I recently received a letter dated March 18 from
Jghn Cleghom, vice chairman of the Annual Fund for

Young Alumni.

In his letter, Cleghom informs me that a classmate
from the Senior Pledge Project will contact me and
ask whether I will make a pledge to the

Annual Fund.

“W&L recognizes that the ability of its alumni to
kc signiﬁcant gifts increases over time,” says
Cleghom in his letter. I’m not quite sure that Mr.
Cleghom has taken an honest look at the ability of
W&L’s seniors to contribute to the fund. His request
is nothing short of rude and insensitive to the ﬁnancial

situations of the senior class.

I learned of the practice of hitting up seniors for
rfoney as a sophomore. Some of my senior friends at
the time told me that they had received similar letters
prior to graduation. I had always assumed that they
were exaggerating with regard to the content of the
letter, or that they were giving me only one side of

the story.

Now that I have a letter of my own, I realize why

my friends were upset.

these people?

bad light.

tuition bill?

I graduate?

Many seniors have not yet found their places in the
job market. Many also have student loans and other
ﬁnancial obligations that they haven’t even started to
pay off. Does it sound as if Washington and Lee’s
Annual Fund is the foremost thing in the minds of

Cleghom also uses language in-his letter that
places a refusal to give to the Annual Fund in a

“One of the school’s strongest traditions is the
Annual Fund — and you have benefitted from that
tradition for the last four years... [Y]early gifts by
W&L alumni have helped you pay the cost of your
education,” states the letter.

Am I to take it that I owe Washington and Lee for
my education even after I have paid that last

Just because W&L emphasizes alumni donations
over tuition hikes, does that mean that I am obligated
to start participating in this “tradition” even before

I have some advice for Mr. Cleghom if he wishes
to enlist my help in achieving W&L’s ﬁnancial goals:

1) Wait until I get a job. I’ll be glad to give some

money once I have some ﬁnancial independence.

2) Wait until I get out from under the piles of
bills that have accumulated during my stay at W&L.
3) Get in line. Get right in there — behind my
fraternity. I’ll be giving money to my fraternity
before I give money to W&L. At least my fraternity

has the class to wait until after I have graduated to

ask me for a ﬁnancial helping hand.
I have spoken to several fellow members of the

senior class. I have found that although my friends

realize the importance of giving money to W&L,
they disapprove of this impolite method of solicit-
ing contributions. Some of them are outright of-
fended, as am I.

Just for the record, I am not against giving
money to our fine institution. I will be-happyto
contribute in the future, when I have established

some sort of ﬁnancial independence. Until then,

Sincerely,
Thomas F. Hespos, Jr. ’94

don’t call me for contributions. As is the case with
many of my classmates, my primary ﬁnancial obli-
gations lie elsewhere.

' Square dance with Wildgrass to raise money for
Habitat for Humanity A

To the editor,

The Catholic Campus Ministry is
sponsoring a square dance on Satur-
day, April 30 at 9 p.m. in the Washing-
ton and Lee University Tavern, the
General’s Headquarters.

This fun-ﬁlled event is open to the
general public.

Becky MacKenzie will teach and
cDll all square and contra dances.

Ms. MacKenzie’s enthusiastic and

humorous style will enable everyone,
whether an awkward beginner or an
experienced dance, to learn the various
steps and moves necessary in each par-
ticular dance. She is a former Ferrum
folk-life professor and has compiled a
repertoire of over 100 dances.
Wildgrass will perform the rhyth-
mic old—timey music reminiscent of
barn dances from days gone by.
After every few dances while the

dancers are resting, they will sing and
play bluegrass favorites, in addition to
the dance music. Members of
Wildgrass include Freddy Goodhart,
Johnny Staton, Burr Datz, “Jake”
Schoﬁeld, and Dan Newhall.

There will be a $2 admission fee,
which will be donated to Washington
and Lee’s new Habitat for Humanity
Chapter, organized by Francie Cohen
and Leo Decanini.

To the editor,

At its April 4 faculty meeting, the
following resolutionwas passed by the
faculty for the intent of distribution
within the community:

“We, the members of the under-
graduate faculty of Washington and
Lee University, support the decision of
the Student Affairs Committee, as re-
viewed by the President, to suspend the
Phi Gamma Delta chapter; we afﬁrm
our conﬁdence in the process through

which the decision was reached; and
we commend the integrity and courage
of those who contributed to the pro-
cess. We hope that all members of the
Phi Gamma Delta chapter, as well as
others in the Greek system at Washing-
ton and Lee will respond positively to
this action.”

Women head for third championshi e

By KEITH GRANT
Phi StaffVVriter

New York Knicks coach Pat Riley
is in position to make some extra money
this weekend, and it has nothing to do
with the start of the NBA playoffs.

While coach of the LA Lakers, Riley
bought the rights to the term “Three-
peat.” Its three-peating that Washing-
ton & Lee’s women’s lacrosse team is
two wins away from achieving.

The two-time defending Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference champi-
ons face Lynchburg College in a semi-
final game Friday afternoon.

The Generals advanced to this point
with a 15-9 win Tuesday over Sweet
Briar in the ODAC Tournament’ s open-
ing round of play.

Seventh-ranked Lynchburg, a ﬁve-
time ODAC champion, won the regu-
lar season title and will host the semi-
ﬁnal and ﬁnal rounds of the tourna-
ment.

Eighth—ranked Roanoke College
faces Randolph-Macon in Friday’s
other contest, with the two victors meet-
ing on Saturday for the championship.

W&L was defeated by Lynchburg
in their regular season match, 12-11.
The Hornets held a 12-7 lead with 5:34
left in the game, but had to fight off a
furious W&L rally to hang on for the
one—goal win.

Senior Angie Carrington scored five
times in that game, including the Gen-
erals’ eleventh goal with 1:05 remain-
mg.

That comcback gives the Generals
reason to believe they can take the
Hornets on Friday. Head coach Jan

Hathom said her team lapsed for about
ten minutes against Lynchburg, but is
as good a squad as the Hornets.

“We have to play 60 minutes all the
way,” said Hathom.

Junior Dana Cornell believes the
Generals are a very different team than
they were when beaten by Lynchburg.

“We’re more experienced and more
comfortable with each other, and we
know our strengths and weaknesses,”
she said. “We’re deﬁnitely ready.”

Junior Sarah Ascenbach points to
the recent return of Nicole Ripken (19
goals in 8 games) as one reason why
the Generals are an improved team
from when they last faced Lynchburg.

“We’rc going to be a different team.
We’re playing at a much higher level
now,” Aschenbach said.

Aschenbach and sophomore Cheryl
Taurassi, both defensive starters, were
injured early against Lynchburg and
hardly saw any action. Although
Taurassi is out for the season,
Aschenbach is one of several Generals
that has recently recovered from inju-
ries and will face the Hornets Friday.

Tuesday ’s win was the ﬁfth straight
tournament win for W&L and the
team’s final game at home, where they
ended the ’94 season 6-2. W&L has
gone 37-12 at the Liberty Hall Fields
since beginning play their in 1989.

The Generals wasted only 58 sec-
onds before taking a 1-0 lead over the
Vixens on a goal by Ripken, her 100th
career point. Sweet Briar, though, net-

ted the next three scores in four min-
utes.

“We shouldn’t have been surprised
[by the early outburst],” said Hathorn.
“Sweet Briar plays tough all the time.”

Two goals in a 15 second span

File Pho

Washington and Lee’s men’s tennis team continued its
dominance of the Old Dominion Athletic Conference by
winning its tenth straight conference title.

brought W&L back into a tie.

The teams traded two goals apiece
until the midway point in the half,
when Ripken scored the ﬁrst in a 7-1
run by the Generals that lasted into the
second half. ,

Among the scores was the first of
the year by sophomore Chrissy
Donnelly, who found the not just as
ﬁrst half time expired.

“We weren’t playing poorly [to that
point], but not at our level,” Hathom
said. “After half-time [the Generals]
went out and took care of business.”

With a 12-6 lead and 28 minutes to
play, W&L seemed assured of advanc-
ing at least one more round. The Vix-
ens’ Tavi Hyland scored to cut the lead
to ﬁve with 12:48 left, but Carrington
ended any hopes Sweet Briar had of a
comeback by answering that goal with
one of her own 14 seconds later.

Carrington carried the ball virtually
untouched from midﬁeld to net her
second of three goals, the last of which
"came at the ﬁnal buzzer.

Junior Lindsay Coleman and Ripken
also scored three times for the Gener-
als, with junior Cornell adding a pair.

Washington & Lee is now 8-6 over-
all this season and is 7-3 since the loss
to Lynchburg. Friday’s game begins at
4:00, with the championship sched-
uled for 2:00 Saturday.

While the W&L and Roanoke men’s
lacrosse teams have ﬁnished one-two
in the ODAC the passed three seasons,
the ODAC women’s ﬁnal has featured
those two schools two years in a row.

It may be hard to imagine the rivalry
getting any more intense, but victories
by the Generals and Maroons Friday
will do just that, and Pat Riley couldn’t
be happier.

Baseball

Bates Brown ended his amazing
season at the plate last Saturday,
acquiring his thirty sixth hit in a 9-4
loss to VMI.

His hit broke the school record
set by Chris Cavalline in 1982.

However, the hits did not neces-
sarily bring an average record as
well. Despite his record performance
Brown came up just short.

As of April 25, Brown was hit-
ting 393, just 14 points below the
record, also set by Cavallinc, of .407.

Meanwhile, Pitcher-outfielder
Greg Fantuzzi is also had a hot sea-
son at the plate, batting .450, but fell
two at bats short of the number
needed to qualify for the record.

On the mound, Matt
Ermigiottcarried a one hitter into the
sixth in the second game against
Guilford. The Generals record now
stands at 7-18-1.

With ﬁve Washington and Lee
spring teams claiming Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference champion-
ships this week, April proved by far
to be the most successful month of
1993-94 for W&L sports.

Oddly, the WLUR-Ring-tum Phi
selection for April’s Major-General
does not come from any of those
teams.

However, the performance of
sophomore Dax Mahoney at the
men’s ODAC Track & Field Cham-
pionships last week earned the
sprinter the coveted award as W&L’s
Athlete-of-the-month.

Mahoney scored a meet-high 33
points to pace the Generals to a sec-
ond-place finish, behind champion
Lynchburg.

His point total topped the scores
of three entire teams and earned
Mahoney Outstanding Athlete of the
Meet honors.

Victorious in four events,
Mahoney won individual titles in both
the 200 and 400 meter dash, while
ﬁnishing second to teammate Hayne
Hodges in his first collegiate attempt
at the 100m. The sophomore also ran
on W&L’s winning 400 and 1600
meter relays.

Joining Mahoney and Hodges as
ODAC titlists were sophomore Har-
ris Morrison (pole vault), senior Grant
Cowell (800), and senior Scott Covey
(400 hurdles). Head coach Norris
Aldridge was named ODAC Coach

Coming up this weekend, the women’s lacrosse to n
has the chance to win its third straight Old Dominio
Athletic Conference championship.

Women's Tennis

The women’s’ tennis team took
their fourth consecutive ODAC title,
winning eight of nine ﬂights. They
won the ﬁrst six singles matches,
with victories form Marilyn Baker
(1), Julie Ayers (2), Shelly Sunderrnan
(3), Hellen Chandler (4), Anna Chan-
dler (5), and Cathy Gartin (6).

The team ﬁnished with three play-
ers- Baker, Ayers, and O’Connor-
acquiring twenty wins apiece. Baker
was named ODAC player of the year.
The W&L squad is currently ranked
number two in Division III.

Based on their monster season,
the W&L tennis team will cam a trip
to the NCAA tournament for the first
time in three years.

In past years, players have trav-
elled as individuals, but the team has
not made the trip as a unit.
