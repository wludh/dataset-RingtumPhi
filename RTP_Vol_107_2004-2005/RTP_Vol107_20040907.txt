Washington and I_.ee students can now join histori-
cally black Greek organizations. Alpha Phi Alpha, a
historically black fraternity and Delta Sigma Theta, a
historically black sorority, are recruiting this semester.

Alpha Phi Alpha’s recruitment began last May,
when representatives of the fraternity met with 12 Wash-
ington and Lee men. Sean Bates. the Alpha Phi Alpha
representative supervising this campus’s recruitment,
is holding an informational seminar on Wednesday.

“I’m attending the IFC meeting as a guest of the
University—l want to see how it works and to see how
the two organizations can collaborate,” Bates said.

Alpha Phi Alpha will be accepting applications for
membership after Wednesday’s informational seminar. -

The fratemity’s Membership Intake, or pledgeship,
lasts two weeks. Bates said he expects to see Alpha Phi
Alpha members on Washington and Lee’s campus, “by
December 1.”

University, said Dean Tammy Futrell. “We don’t have a

.the critical mass of students of color in general to have

a chapter here,” she said.

Because it is a joint chapter, Futrell said that some of
Alpha Phi Alpha’s activities will take place in Lexington
and some will take place at James Madison University.

Alpha Phi Alpha was the first intercollegiate Greek-
letter fraternity for African-Americans. It is now an in-
terracial fraternity, and has been since 1946, said Bates.
It was founded in 1906 at Cornell University.

Any male student who is not already a member of
another fraternity is eligible for membership in Alpha Phi
Alpha. '

Futrell expects recruitment for the sorority, Delta

Futrell said.

Washington and Lee women can join Delta SigmaTheta
through a joint chapter with Roanoke College. Activities will
take place at Washington and Lee and at oanoke College.

Delta Sigma Theta will also have members on campus,
“hopefully by December 1,” Futrell said.

Delta Sigma Theta was chartered by 22 students at

Campus
memorializes
student’ s life

BY Cums LAUDERMAN
MANAGING EDITOR

The campus community is mourning the death of one
of its own. Students and faculty will come together Sep-
tember 18 at 5 p.m. in Lee Chapel to remember the life of
rising sophomore Zachary Parmenter who died in an auto-
mobile accident in July.

“We are gathering the university to mourn, but also
to recognize there is hope,” said Acting Chaplain Burr
Datz. He wants the student body to realize there is hope
in these hard situations because he believes our campus
culture thinks death is the end. “We have to gather and
tell stories,” said Datz. Remembering the good times and
talking about Zach is good for the campus, Datz said.

Datz and Dustin Jacobson, President of Sigma Nu are
planning the service together. Students will take an active
role by reading Bible versus and reﬂecting on Parmenter.
Sigma Nu also plans on doing a fraternity ritual at the
service. Jacobson hopes that Parmenter’s parents will be
able to make it to Lexington for the memorial.

Parmenter’s friends describe him as perky, one of a
kind, and intelligent. They also acknowledge his strong
spiritual life.

Parmenter was spending his summer as a researcher
for the Physics and Engineering department under Assis-
tant Professor David Sukow. He was studying chaos syn-
chronization in diode lasers.

“Zach had a quiet- but keen sense of humor, and took
pleasure in the small, daily absurdities that arose in the
lab,” said Sukow. “He thought clearly and spoke articu-
lately, which gave him a real knack for explaining his in-
sights to others. In only two months of lab work, he had
already acquired the single most important capability a
research student can have - a certain intellectual courage,
the willingness to try things even when no one knew ex-
actly what the outcome would be. He will be greatly
missed.” ‘ .

“He was so unafraid to be himself and that’s what
we’ll miss most about him,” said Jacobson.

Freshman Wins
Oprah makover

Albany??? Are you Southerners going to get your butt whooped by the
Yankees again??? I mean losing the Civil War was bad enough, but
letting a bunch of liberal, tree-hugging northerners out party you? That,
my friend, is outrageous. ~

I think we all know who is to blame for this embarrassing defeat is, and
their name starts with an I-N, and ends with a dependants. I know all you
Indies out there think its cooler to go against the grain and do your own
thing, but let me let you in on a well known secret. . .. It’s not cool. So get

out there and carry your own weight. if not for me, do it for the southemers,

they’ve been losers for 150 years, which is longer than the Red Sox. This
year do your part to beat those damn Yankees, don’t be the Dubya version
of Bill Buckner.

Okay, that’s all, I promise not to talk about those stupid rankings
anymore. Now it’s on to much less interesting and less important things. ..
freshmen.

As once the epitome of an underachieving, exaggerating, arrogant

' Z , freshman, I shall offer my advice on your upcoming year in the hopes that

you are able to make these the best of your four, or for you “special” kids,
five years of your life. ,

You have fifteen hours of class each week... go to them all. Just
because your biology teacher doesn’t take roll doesn’t mean it’s a good

‘idea to skip 39 out of your 46 classes (believe me people have done it). You

will not pass, nor should you. More importantly, as I found out last year,
don’t skip a class where the teacher only allows a certain number of ab-
sences.

Karma will come around and after you have used up all your absences

'. f you will get an ulcer on the back of your throat and still have to go to class.

You are here for a reason, and remember what that reason is.

You are not smart. Your class as a whole may be the smartest class
ever to come into W&L, but so was every class before you, and we too are
all dumb. Just because you got a 1530 on your SA'l‘s, and have never

. : received a grade lower than an A— does not mean you will continue that

tradition here. And if you do, well you suck at life and 1 hate you.
While freshman guys’ main concern should be in the classroom, this
is not true for freshman girls. You should be in a frat basement every

semester you will be sucked up to and offered all sorts of free stuff.
Do your best to separate the, fakes from the legits, cause come
pledgeship, and much more importantly the next three years, you are
going to want friends, not acquaintances who tricked you into making
you think they liked you.

I know I said the P word in the past paragraph, but you as rushees
should forget about plcdgeship for right now at least. You know the
rumors about Beta, FIJI, and nearly every other frat on campus getting
in trouble for something or another during pledgeship, but you must
understand that the school, for obvious reasons of safety, overreacted
to last years pledgeship, and most of the frats were, if not cleared,
deserved to be. So don’t make your decision based on it, and don’t
mention the F word again.

‘ While on the ever talked-about topic of frats and srats, don’t sui-
cide rush. If you know the first week what house you want to be in.
that’s awesome, but make sure to go to other houses too. You never
know what may happen and suicide rushers too get balled. So expect
the best, but plan for the worst. And always remember there are 15, I
mean 14, wait now 13 frats on campus and you can be happy and have
a great four years at almost any of them. Much like colleges there isn’t
just one perfect fit.

Girls. you all can’t be Kappa’s, and why you would all want to be is
beyond me. So come rush week... don’t be one of the girls in the
bathroom crying because you didn’t get into your first choice sorority.
By the time you have graduated you will realize it’s not what srat you
were in, but rather if you enjoyed your four years here. And that you
can do no matter what Greek organization you joined.

lfl learned anything last year it was that moderation in life equals
success. I know this is getting especially deep for a hick from Idaho,
but give me a second or two.

You won’t be happy in the library every night and you won’t be
successful being at a frat every night either. You have enrolled in a
work hard—play hard school, and if you expect to be happy doing any-
thing else, you are painfully wrong.

So go out and enjoy the Fall, but don’t enjoy it too
much....except of course for the freshman girls.

Elliot Walker reveals her new look in September 17 show

BY SARAH MURRAY
NEWS EDITOR

Producers of The Oprah
Winfrey Show surprised a student
in the Commons last Monday with a
plane ticket to Los Angeles and a
free makeover. Students crowded
around as producers informed
freshman Elliott Walker that she
would be showing off her new look

in front of a studio audience in two

weeks.

When Walker heard a disturbance
in the dining hall last Monday, she
looked up from her dinner and saw her
sister Allie, who attends college in an-
other state. The sight was so surpris-
ing that Walker didn’t realize the ac-
tual meaning of her presence, even
when her sister asked, “Do you remem-
ber when you wrote to Oprah. . .?”

“It took me awhile to figure out
the cameras were there,” said Walker.

Walker applied for the makeover
on oprah.com, which advertises on-
screen opportunities to “SURPRISE
someone who does a GREAT JOB” or
to do “the ONE THING you’ve only
DREAMED of doing”, among others.

“I’d written to the Oprah show
countless times and I’d never heard
back.” Walker admitted. When she
received an e-mail this summer ask-

ing for clothing sizes and a photo,
she waited anxiously for the notifi-
cation promised within two weeks.
After three weeks, she gave up and
sent in another application, un-
aware that she had been chosen for
the makeover.

Producers contacted Walker’s
family, as well as Dean of Fresh-
men David Leonard, before am-
bushing her in the Commons din-
ing hall.

With sister in tow, Walker ﬂew
to California early Tuesday morn-
ing for two days spent in salons,
boutiques, and Beverly Hills’ luxu-
rious Le Meridien Hotel.

Unfortunately, Walker has to
keep her lips sealed about the show
until its airing on September 17.

A mystery celebrity guest
chaperoned Ellie and Allie through
their shopping excursions, and the
show’s producers don’t want the
secret to slip. '

Walker, a native of Florence,
South Carolina, will miss her first
day of classes for the show’s tap-
ing in Chicago.

With the support of her family
and the administration, she’s
thrilled that all her fondest e-mails
have finally been answered. “I
guess it finally paid off!”

“Gentlemen of T he Ring—tum Phi, you have our best wishes. Gentle-
men of The Ring-tum Phi, we give our sincerest thanks. Students of W. and L.,
we congratulate you on the advent of the long needed weekly!”

The year was 1897. The Southern Collegian was still a high-quality
magazine, being published by the Graham Literary Society. The Ring-tum Phi
was designed to be a somewhat lighter, perhaps even ribald, complement to
the Collegian.

Eighteen and ninety-seven. The year the football coach had to send
away for a special noseguard “to protect the colossal proboscis which accom-
panies Mr. Fitzhugh’s countenance.” (“Mr.” Fitzhugh was a student; every-
body then was Mister or Doctor of Professor or Reverend.)

Scandalous Verse
Eighteen and ninety-seven. The year of the Great Hell Scandal. It
seems the very first editor-in-chief, George Houston, in the fourth issue of the
neophyte newspaper, published a column of “Football Songs.” one of which
was included withthis verse:
“Each other’s back, boys
“Has got a knack, boys,

puts the verse in the first column of the newspaper and writes an editorial
commending it as ‘especially good.’ He says the words tire the voice a little.

“Now everyone, who knows anything of the subject, knows that the
sound of that ‘h’ has a very rasping effect on the vocal chords. How much
better it would have been had the line read: ‘And yell right well, boys.’ It
would have sounded better, been easier on the voice, and would have saved
the writer and Editor from showing their weakness. ,

“It can be admitted that, to some eyes, there is something worthy of
admiration in a dark, purple crime, but to bow before a sinlet like this is weak-
ness personified.

“In the future let me suggest that the Editor follow the path of virtue.
He will not only find it pleasant, but may keep himself ﬁom showing his lack of
taste.

_R”

Well, “R.” intimidated Mr. Houston. Who wouldn’t be intimidated if
he were editing a brand-new paper that nobody, not even students, had ever
heard of, named the Ring-tum Phi; and somebody came along and accused
him of printing sinlets on his front page?
