do we appropriately rule on situations
where honor is questioned? We want
your feedback to tell us how W&L
should interpret honor by ruling on
our hypothetical case.

W&L hosts NCUR

Thousands of students visit Lexington

By Chris Lauderman
CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

2,200 undergraduate students from
across the country invaded Lexington
April 21-23 for the 19"‘ National
Conference on Undergraduate Research
(NCUR).

Washington and Lee and Virginia
Military Institute co—hosted the national
weekend conference. The two schools
began the planning process of hosting the
conference a few years ago.

“I went to a meeting at the
University of Utah, along with VMI Dean
of the Faculty Brower to present a proposal
for us to host the conference,” Provost
Tom Williams said. “The NCUR
Governing Board accepted our proposal a
bit over two years ago.”

A unique twist to the conference this
year was the joint sponsoring by VMI and
W&L. Two different cultures, a public and
a private school, “came together and got
the job done,” according to Tim Kolly,
Vice President for Public Affairs and
Communication.

Both W&L and VMI’s public
relations ofﬁces said it was an excellent
experience working together.

“This is a great resume piece for
both schools,” Kolly said.

Students participating in NCUR
made oral presentations, presented posters,
and performed for peers. Oral

presentations lasted for 15 minutes and
generally had 10-15 people in the
audience. Washington andLee showcased '

. STEPPING UP TO THE CHALLENGE

35 presenters at this year’s conference.

Lain Wilson, a freshman at W&L,
was encouraged by one of his history
professors to present a European history
paper.

“It was a senior project in high
school,” Wilson said. “I spent six months
researching and two months writing it.”

All students presenting had the
option to submit their work to be published
through NCUR. Students will find out
later in the year if they have been selected
for publication.

Other students, such as senior Ricky
Busby, presented their thesis. Busby, a
Medieval and Renaissance Studies major,
presented Friday afternoon on “Franciscan

I Art as Propaganda.”

Sophomore Julie Jackson said that
this was a great opportunity for
undergraduates to present academic
research.

“I met a lot of Geology students and
professors from other schools,” Jackson
said. “It was really fun.”

Andrew Upshaw, a junior at VMI,
presented on the Madrid terrorist attacks.
He thought his presentation went well
despite the fact that he was really nervous
with all of the professors from around the
country listening to his presentation.

Kolly was pleased with the
involvement of the W&L community
saying that “everyone has come together.”
Many of the faculty was involved in
moderating panels and students took
interest in the conference.

Wor1d’s fastest climber visits W&L

Contact, Outing Club sponsored motivational speaker Hans Florine Tuesday

ByAlex Kraus
STAFF WRITER

World-renowned speed climber
Hans Florine said that the cliff face where
he experienced one of the greatest
disappointments of his life was the same
place where he experienced his greatest
triumph.

The motivational speaker,
sponsored by Washington and Lee’s
Outing Club and CONTACT, had been
suggested as a possible speaker by Outing
Club advisor James Dick.

Florine set the speed record for
climbing El Capitan at Yosemite National
Park in September 2002, clocking in at 3
hours 24 minutes together with Japanese
climber Yuji Hirayarna.

“This is my back yard. I am very,
very lucky,” Florine said of Yosemite in
'I1iesday’s speech.

“We thought he was a unique
speaker, and we thought attendance would
be good,” said CONTACT member David
Kronenfeld.

Florine spoke to a nearly—full
Commons theater, “We were pleased with
attendance, he was one of the less
expensive speakers so it’s always good

 

-HANSFLOFIE

It can look pretty daunting from the
bottom, but the view is beautiful
from the top. It’s all worth it.

when people attend those...and lots of
people stayed afterwards to talk to him”
Kronenfeld said.

Florine first tried to climb El
Capitan in 1988. He only made it a fraction
of the way up the face before he used up
half of his water and food supplies.
Realizing he wouldn’t make it all the way,
he said he had to turn back “with my tail
between my legs.”

“If you had told me in 1988 that you
could climb El Capitan in a day, I would
have said you were crazy,” he said.

But Florine said it was his personal
goal to climb both El Capitan and nearby

_Half Dome in one day in 1999 that brought

him both disappointment and his greatest
feeling of personal reward.

Florine heard through friends that a
fellow speed climber, Dean Potter, was
planning to be the first person to climb

e

both mountains in a day. Florine resolved
to beat Potter to the challenge, though he
knew it would not be an easy task. Florine
set a date and began telling friends of his
plans in order to raise his own conﬁdence.

“I had never soloed Half Dome
before. When I practiced it, it took me
seven hours,” said Florine, who considers
“the nose” of El Capitan to be his favorite
path.

Florine set out at 3:24 a.m. on July
28, 1999, to begin climbing Half Dome.
He reached the top six andla half hours
later.

When he reached the valley again,
he met up with a friend, Steve Schneider,
who delivered a devastating piece of news.
Florine’s plans had passed by word-of-
mouth to Potter, provoking him to
complete the two climbs only a day before.
By the time Florine reached the base of El

Capitan, he was so disappointed that he
wasn’t sure whether it was worth it to go
on.

“I just started climbing. I didn’t
know what else to do,” he admitted. “I
thought, ‘I carmot be climbing with all this
negative stuff in my head.”’

Florine said he only got his
motivation back when he realized that
Potter’s sequence was different from his
own. Potter climbed El Capitan first, then
Half Dome. Florine realized he would still
be the ﬁrst person to climb Half Dome,
then El Capitan.

One photo published in a rock
climbing magazine showed an exhausted
but smiling Florine successfully reaching
the peak of El Capitan.

“This photo captures the most
rewarded I’ve ever felt in my life,” he said.

Florine summarized his experiences
by saying that pursuing your goals even
when you feel disappointed or frustrated
can lead to the greatest satisfaction.

He said, “It can look pretty daunting
from the bottom, but the view is beautiful
from the top. It’s all worth it.”

The day after his speck, Florine held
a climbing seminar out at Goshen for
interested students.

Ladies’ Tennis ro ls
into ODAC Finals

Byxamynxralwrsponsneiease
STAFFWFITER

On Saturday, the third-ranked
Washington and Lee women’s tennis team
dominated the ODAC Championship
playoffs at Hollins University for the
second day in a row.

All six singles players advanced to
the finals by defeating their players by
large margins. No W&L player dropped
more than two wins en route to her victory.
Senior Lindsay Hagerman again defended
her top spot by easily downing her
opponent.

Kristen McClung, Emily Applegate,
Ginny Wortham, Katie Kingsbury, and
Leah Weston all won their semifinal
matches and advanced to the
championship match in their ﬂight. In
addition, the team had all three doubles
teams advance to the semiﬁnals, which
will be played on Sunday.

At No. 1 singles, Hagerman
defeated Kayla Carter of Emory & Henry,
6-0, 6-2, and will play Elizabeth Kristofak
of Randolph-Macon in the ﬁnals.

At No. 2 singles, McClung knocked
off Melissa James of Hollins, 6-2, 6-0, and
will take on Trista McGlotl1lin of Emory
& Henry for the title.

Applegate beat Guilford’s Songan
Nguyen, 6-0, 6-0, and will meet Hilary
Teeter for the championship at No. 3

singles.

At No. 4 singles, Wortham bested
Avery Latronica of Roanoke, 6-0, 6-2, and
will play Hollins’ Candice Dalton in the
ﬁnals. Weston was a 6-0, 6-0 winner over
Sarah Sullivan at No. 5 singles and will
take on Anne Ryan of Emory & Henry for
the title.

At No. 6 singles, Kingsbury beat
Emory & Henry’s Kate Childress, 6-0, 6-
1, and will face Jessie Bayne of Randolph-
Macon for the championship.

In quarterﬁnals doubles action, the
duo of Hagerman and Wortham knocked
off Kierra McMillian and Lisa Fanney of
Virginia Wesleyan, 8-1, at No. 1 doubles.
At No. 2 doubles, Applegate and McClung
bested the pair of Megan McEwen and
Amy Iden of Randolph-Macon, 8-3, while
Weston and senior Lora Farris posted an
8-3 victory over Lynchburg’s Kathryn
Andrews and Erica Seay at No. 3 doubles.

W&L tennis has always been a
powerhouse in the ODAC conference, and
winning ODAC championships was a goal
the team held since the beginning of the
year. With the entire team playing at their
top form, the team is well on its way to
accomplishing this goal.

The Generals return to the court for
the ﬁnal day of the ODAC Championships
on Sunday when the singles ﬁnals and
doubles semifinals and finals will be

played.

Three General athletes
honored for academics

DySpa1sFblease

Sports Information

Three Washington and Lee athletes
received academic honors in the past
week. Paul McClure and Nathan Johnson
each were named Scholar-athletes of the
year for their respective sports. Lindsey
Hagerman was also honored by being
named one of the six ﬁnalists for the
‘Walter Byers Award.

McClure is a philosophy major who
carries a 3.316 cumulative grade-point
average (GPA). He is currently ranked 25th
in Division HI among singles players and
claims a 14-8 singles record and a 13-8
doubles mark.

McClure is a two-time ODAC
Player of the Year and a three-time First
Team All-ODAC honoree. Last spring, he
earned First Team All-America honors
after advancing to the quarterfinals of the
NCAA Division III Singles
Championship.

Men’s tennis claimed its 10th
straight ODAC Championship over the
weekend. McClure and the Generals now
wait to find out who their opponent will
be in the opening round of the NCAA
Division Ill Tournament which begins on
May 7.

Johnson, a math and economics
major, carries a cumulative grade—point
average of 3.706 and earned First Team
All-ODAC honors at the 2005 ODAC
Indoor Track & Field Championships on
Feb. 27.

Johnson won the 5000 meters at the
ODAC meet in a school-record time of
15 :35 .93. He also ran a school-record time
of 8:37.24 in the 3000 meters at the
Christopher Newport Invitational earlier

this season.

Johnson was also named the 2004
ODAC Cross Country Scholar-athlete and
Runner of the Year. At the ODAC Cross
Country Championships on Oct. 30,
Johnson won the race in a time of28: 16.56
to help lead the Generals to the ODAC
title.

Johnson also won the NCAA South]
Southeast Regional in a time of 26:43.82
to earn all-region accolades and qualify
for the NCAA Championships. At the
NCAA’s, Johnson ﬁnished 83rd out of 215
runners in a personal—best time of
25:48.60.

The Walter Byers Award is one of
the NCAA’s most prestigious awards and
is presented in recognition of outstanding
academic achievement and future success
in postgraduate studies and planned
careers.

The NCAA selects one male and
one female recipient each year and awards
the winners a $21,500 scholarship for
graduate school. The awardee also has the
option of renewing the scholarship for a
second year given that they are in good
academic standing and a full-time student
during the second year of study.

Hagerman is a history major with a
3.677 cumulative GPA. On the tennis
court, she claims a 106-17 (.862) career
singles record and a 101-15 (.871) career
doubles mark, both among the all-time
best records in school history.

A six-time NCAA All-American,
Hagerman has a 26-1 record in singles and
a 19-2 record in doubles this season. She
won the Intercollegiate Tennis Association
Division III National Singles
Championship during the fall and was the
ITA’s National Co-Rookie of the Year in
2002. '

W&L’s NCUR
enthusiasm low

Though on the front page of this
week’s Phi, Tim Kolly calls NCUR, “a
great resume piece for both schools,”
meaning for both Washington and Lee
and the Virginia Military Institute, we
at The Ring-tum Phi feel that the
University let a great opportimity slip
through its ﬁngers.

Though the Conference was
well-publicized this past week on
Washington and Lee’s website, students
were less than informed, and thus less
than enthusiastic, about the event.

If the Conference was important
enough for thousands of students to ﬂy
in from across the nation to attend, one
would think that W&L students, being
as smart and capable as they are, would
jump at the chance to present research
at such a prestigious event. And
yet...NCUR people seemed to swirl
around campus and through Lexington
in their own little bubble, separate from
W&L and not interacting much with our
students.

During this academic year, there
was little to no discussion of NCUR in
any of our academic classes. Although
several Washington and Lee students
did present research, and we’re sure

* they were brilliant, what bothers us is

the very blasé attitude most of the
campus took toward the whole event.
We cannot really blame the students,
however, seeing as how there was little
effort made to involve the campus.

Few professors encouraged
students to attend, publicity leading up
to the actual event was fairly sparse, and
no activities including N CUR students
were well-publicized.

We are afraid that NCUR
students from across the country left
Lexington with the ‘idea that W&L
students are a very apathetic breed.

UPS & DOWNS

Opinions Editor Caley Anderson has
ﬁnished sucking up to his profs to give
you his take on what rose and fell this
week at W&L and around the world.

0 AP!“

I wore shorts on Sunday. Shorts, and
then it snowed. SNOWED, and it’s
almost May.

GICUR

Yes, the conference itself was good.
But if I had to think of one thing that
Lexington needed, “more tour buses”
is not at the top of the list.

ONFL Draft

What’s really funny is Maurice Clarett
receiving the mercy of the Denver
Broncos by’ being drafted at the end of
the third round. Poor guy.

0 Hawley-smootTariff

An attempt to isolate the U.S.
economy and thus, it was reasoned,
help it weather the depression, this
tariff, aimed mostly at the agricultural
sector, severely deepended the
economic damage of the depression.

0 New Construction

Hey, as long as we’re building stuff,
can we put a new library up
somewhere? Imean, really.

I 0Mirage

Shut down for serving underage
NCUR attendees. Ouch. I thought
these sort of events were supposed to
HELP local businesses.

0 Pope

Elected very quickly, showing great
conﬁdence from cardinals. But will
this noted conservative be able to
unify Catholics? I

OMass transit

58% more Americans now using

Sorority sister calls for
Derby Days improvements

In light of the sensitive nature of
this topic, this writer wishes to remain
anonymous. ’

Spring term tends to make me
nostalgic for home and the past. You
remember the most random things: like
Field Day in elementary school. It was
always my favorite week of the year.
Good, clean fun. And I always
dominated against the other little kids
and cherished the blue ribbons which
were offered as proof of my
athleticism. But when I contrast this
memory with the inter—sorority
competition which is Derby Days, I am
left bewildered.

What is Derby Days about
really? In the past I went to it to support
my sorority and didn’t think to analyze
its greater purpose. I just got in my gym
clothes, perhaps a slightly spruced up
version of them, and went. After all, it
was for a good cause, right? A full week
devoted to philanthropy and sisterly
bonding. Now, I’m no longer
convinced.

Let’s look at the facts. A
nationally—recognized philanthropic
event for Sigma Chi, Derby Days
consists of roughly ﬁve days of events.
There is ﬁeld day, two days of powder-
puff football, a skit night, and of course
parties at the pole houses. But as I’m
there, cheering on my friends and
sisters, I look around. Besides the fact
that no one will convince me that this
isn’t just another excuse for students
to be able to drink during the day, I see
the whole picture as generally
degrading.

~ Most men who are around are
standing up on their porches drinking

beer and looking on in amusement as
women in the ﬁve sororities compete
against each other. Drinking is
encouraged by all participants too, of
course. Alittle nastiness tends to ensue.
And even if everyone is completely
civil, you would be hard pressed to
show that sorority relations are
improved or the Greek System
strengthened.

And don’t get me started on
the infamous t-shirts being sold as an
alternative to the sororities’ winning
design. I have yet to see it in person,
perhaps because none of my friends
would ever dream of buying it, but it
apparently depicts one woman
spanking another with a Sigma Chi
paddle. Needless to say, the design was
never approved through the proper
administrative channels. What is the
message being sent? Is it as it appears:
that Derby Days is about sponsoring
female cat fights for the viewing
pleasure of fraternity men?

Please don’t get me wrong.
I think Sigma Chi is a great fraternity
with a lot of stand—up, nice guys. I am
simply left asking myself why they
would agree to host such a ridiculous
and patronizing event. Derby Days at
W&L need to match what is
happening at other campuses across
the nation. It should fulfill a clear,
philanthropic function where all the
participants know what cause they are
supporting and the dollar amount
raised. Alcohol should not be the
focus. And it should bring people
together and strengthen the Greek
System. If not, women should just
stop going.

Anderson reviews W&L strategic plan

ByCdeyAnderson

I!/fIE=iA‘lE'S|VLﬁ\l§

The University’s strategic plan draft
has generated a lot of noise in recent
months. Full of mostly good ideas, there
are a few high-proﬁle proposed initiatives
that are generating the aforementioned
noise.

In a two—part editorial, we’ll look
at the good and the bad of these standout
strategic plan initiatives, while
recognizing that the document is mostly
full of positive innovation. This week, in
true Phi fashion, we start with the bad.

First, and most notoriously, the
proposal to make on-campus, non-Greek
residence for sophomores mandatory.

The strategic plan states (in its
student affairs section) “We propose that
freshmen and sophomores live in carnpus—

based residential learning communities ‘

while upper-class (juniors and seniors)
students live in Greek housing (also
residential learning based programs) and
off campus. Learning Communities could
be developed by theme, including the
sciences, foreign languages,
environmental issues, social justice,
cultural heritage, etc.”

The most commonly-raised
objection is that sophomores are an
integral part of a Greek organization’s
makeup, and that to force sophomores

away from the Greek houses and into
dorms would alter Greek organizations’
dynamics for the worse. On top of that,
though, there are serious logistical
problems.

Presumably, a new (and expensive)
dorm would be built to help accomodate
the entirety of the sophomore class.
Gaines and Woods Creek house a total of
342 people; the typical W&L class is about
425. A new building for the sake of 80 or
so people is not terribly cost-efficient
when considering that the only beneﬁt is
the creation of “learning communities,”
which, while they have their beneﬁts, may
or may not be worth tens of millions of
dollars.

This is not to mention the adverse
effects on juniors and seniors, who would
be faced with the binary choice of either
living in a Greek house or off-campus.
The Greek houses and the off-campus
market are already strained without
stufﬁng ALL of the 850 or so juniors and
seniors into them. For Greek students, the
choice between Greek housing and off-
campus housing would become difﬁcult;
for independents, it would be no choice
at all.

If the University DOES adopt this
option, I would hope it would retain a
guarantee to upperclass students that
housing of SOME sort in Lexington would
be available. Commuting to W&L is not

something I’d ever want to do, but future
classes might have to deal with it if the
Lexington housing market gets too
ridiculous as a result of this idea. (I do
like the idea of organizing halls by
academic interest, though). Of course, the
Capital/Space Planning task force report
mentions the need for a speciﬁcally non-
greek facility, and even looks at the
feasibility of it, so maybe there’s
something we don’t know about in the
works.

Also from the Student Affairs
section is this-

“We recommend that the university
institute freshman seminars and the
following shared experiences: Two one-
credit courses required of freshmen in the
fall and winter terms, similar to the model
of the Physical Education requirement.
These courses would be coordinated by
student—affairs professionals but would
also draw heavily on the physical-
education faculty and academic faculty.
The curriculum should include the
following subjects: Student development,
including time management, study skills,
leadership and governance, the Honor
System, university resources, and career
development. Wellness issues, physical
and mental, including alcohol and drugs,
nutrition, ﬁtness, safety, and depression.
Social issues, including diversity,
loneliness and transitions, and open

discussion about social life on campus
including the role of Greek life at
Washington and Lee before and during
pledgeship.”

In other words, this takes orientation
and turns it into two one-credit classes. It’s
simply not necessary.

Besides increasing the course load
of faculty in a bizarre way (what does a
history doctorate, or an expert on
racquetball have to say about time
management, or the vague concept of
“leadership and governance?."), this
increases student courseloads during the
most difficult terms a student has at W&L
and is redundant with orientation. I can
see no real reason to replace orientation
with two classes.

Though the Strategic Plan cites
research that shows such “freshman
seminars” to improve GPAs, retention, and
faculty-student interaction, these were
never really problems at W&L.

Whatl do like, though, is the idea of
a course on the Honor System. Mandatory
for all freshmen or not, I think that the
Honor System is a much deeper subject
which the brief synopsis during orientation
barely does justice to. If you do a course
on non-academics like “study skills,” I
guarantee you that freshmen will treat it as
a non-class, dropping it to the bottom of
their priority list and focusing instead on
the classes that make serious demands of

them. A course on the Honor System,
though, would be very tangible and very
interesting. It could even have the effect
of decreasing the number of honor
violations. The philosophy faculty could
teach it, with appearences by EC members.

Finally, we have the trident. The
strategic plan’s Communications/Extemal
Relations task force, as part of a stated need
to create a uniﬁed graphic image for the
University, recommends that the trident
symbol be made less ominous and less
swastika—like. I like nearly all of this task
force’s recommendations, but this is not one
of them.

The trident has been a part of the
University for a long time; you can see
pictures in the gym of baseball players at
the turn of the 20th century wearing it. I
don’t think it looks particularly swastika-

like, although I grant that it looks sort of A

ominous. I like that about it, though. It
looks mysterious, certainly, and I think it’s
rather a positive thing.

The trident is already a part of the
University’s “unified graphic image.”
Besides, changing it would be a difficult
proposition- the trident is everywhere. It’s
on the gym walls, on University pamphlets,
on athletic equipment, etc. Changing it for
the sake of making it less evil-looking really
isn’t a well—placed priority.

Next week, what I especially liked
about the strategic plan.

Black greek organizations spur campus debate

ByBeckyLeMohe

Tl-ELEIALVIEW

On Thursday the Ofﬁce of Student
Activities and Greek Life and the Ofﬁce
of Multicultural Affairs announced in a
campus notice that they were welcoming
two new Greek organizations to
Washington and Lee, one of which is the
Beta Beta Nu Chapter of Phi Beta Sigma
Fraternity, Inc., which has historically been
regarded as an African—American
fraternity.

This brings us to the question that
has been circling on campus since the
announcement: Will the installation of a
chapter of Phi Beta Sigma at Washington
and Lee have a positive or negative effect
on attempts to unify students?

Since it seems that very few people
have a definite opinion on this issue, I

would like to simply present a list of pros
and cons with the goal of fostering further
discussion on the topic.

ARGUMENTS FOR

As it currently stands, the majority
of African-American students at W&L
tend not to be involved with Greek life.
One possible reason for this is that they
do not feel comfortable or welcomed in
the mostly—white fraternity environment.
The new fraternity would provide them an
alternative option for becoming involved
in the Greek system.

If the fraternity chooses to play
an active role in the Greek community, it
could increase friendly interaction
between African—American students and
other students. For example, at present,
parties are usually very segregated.
However, involvement with the Greek
system could promote integration in social

 

scenes, and this could help improve
relations between all races of students.
Since the new fraternity is an
“open” fraternity, it is seeking to embrace
diversity and brotherhood, not to exclude
students. If the fraternity really is “open”
to all eligible students, then any objections
that it is excluding members of a particular
race are invalid.
ARGUMENTS AGAINST
An African—American fraternity
would increase segregation, rather than
promote integration, because it would
further separate African—American
students from other W&L students. This
would lead to an even bigger divide
between different races of students, and
would impede efforts to promote
acceptance of diversity.

equal opportunity to join the fraternities
that are currently instituted at W&L, and
to prove this, some African—Americans
have successfully done so. Therefore,
why should we try to ﬁx a non—existent
problem by creating a problem that is so
controversial?

Although the new fraternity claims
it is an “open” fraternity, in reality it
probably will be an option only for
African—American students. Thus, the
new fraternity will only create more
tension between the races.

No matter what your stance is on
the issue, we can all probably agree that
the results are entirely dependent on the
direction that the new.,chapter decides to
take and how other W&L students decide
to respond to the new chapter. We
students now have a powerful
responsibility to act in a manner which

could either beneﬁt or harm the cause for
diversity and acceptance, depending on
what actions we consciously choose to
take.

To end, I would like to inform or
remind students of something that the Phi
Beta Sigma website says— “The founders
deeply wished to create an organization
that viewed itself as ‘a part of’ the general
community rather than ‘apart from’ the
general community. They believed that
each potential member should be judged
by his own merits rather than his family
background or afﬂuence...without regard
of race, nationality, skin tone or texture
of hair. They wished and wanted their
fraternity to exist as part of even a greater
brotherhood which would be devoted to
the ‘inclusive we’ rather than the

Chi’s Derby Days

All ﬁve sororities give good eﬁort

ByEr'nJtlius
EDITCFINO-IE:

 

Sigma Chi jump—started Spring
Term’s social activities last week with its
annual philanthropic effort, Derby Days.
The carnpus’s ﬁve sororities competed in
various events, from powderpuff football
to comedic skits, and endeavored to raise
money through such activities as penny
wars and buying Derby Days T-shirts.

Kappa Alpha Theta won
powderpuff football after two days of
inter—sorority football games.

Pi Beta Phi won Wednesday night’s
skit by portraying a Sigma Chi boys
successfully winning over a girl with a
clever pick-up line.

Kappa Kappa Gamma won both the
penny race and Thursday night’s pizza
race. Kappa Kappa Gamma was also
declared the overall winner.

 Greek life creates factions

Fraternities and Sororities mostly good, but have ﬂaws

ByMashdRLle
NIANAQ\GB3llU3

I have always been a supporter of
our Greek system. The good things that
come out of fraternities and sororities
heavily outweigh the negative byproducts.
However there are a few things about the
system that are problematic to me.

The main problem that comes with
Greeks is the exclusiveness due to the
factions the system creates. This problem
can intensify after rush due to bad feelings
of upperclassmen towards a particular
freshman because that person did not go
to such and such fraternity.

I didn’t notice it too much until I
went through the rush process as an
upperclassman. When rushing a person
you can get to be really close to them and
by the end of rush you may feel like that
person is definitely coming to your house.
When that person doesn’t, especially if he
told you he planned on it, you will
obviously have bad feelings towards the
kid.

After rush as a freshman last year, I

.$€ti.e;rsaa:rs§
'§=ea%ti.:=..:;:re=;ae Erie

felt that I had lost a lot of upperclassmen
friends after I didn’t choose their house.
I would feel awkward seeing them in
public and purposely not make eye
contact. Now as a sophomore I ﬁnd me
on the other end of those awkward
moments. v_ , . A K,

. . While I would never be.,mad at
someone for choosing a different house,
it seems like a lot of freshmen think I
would be. While I understand the reasons
behind these fears, I wish they would
change.

As freshmen we lose a lot of our
friends that we had fall term of freshmen
year simply because they went to other
houses. In the Greek system fraternities
rarely mix outside of class. It’s not out of
bad blood for the most part, but rather,
out of laziness. When you live with a
group of friends that is really tight, there
is little reason to go outside of that comfort
zone and make an effort to hang out with
old friends. '

Because of the effort needed to
hang out with friends in other fraternities
there is a sense of exclusiveness to each
frat. Thinking back on last term, I realized

that in the whole 12 weeks I did not step
foot into another fraternity house even for
a band party. While obviously I have
attended off campus parties that were
hosted by other frats, most of the time I
hang out with only fraternity brothers at
those events.

It isinteresting to see which people
are willing to make the effort to hang out
with other people, and which ones don’t.
While I would like to think that I make
the effort necessary to keep all of my
friends, I am realistic in saying that I have
not.

While I will always say the courtesy
hello on the hill, or maybe even get a bite
to eat at the co-op with an old friend, for
the most part, I stick with my frat.

Like I said in the beginning, the
Greek system at W&L is very unique and
something that works very well and is very
enjoyable to be a part of it. I think schools
with fraternities work are much better for
students than ones without. '

At the same time, we need to take it
a little less serious and find a way to keep

. our old friends and at the same time make

the most of our own fraternity.

You’ve been served

Trout explains why sequel to “You
got Served” will change your life

Bynughrmut

WE 

I just got served. And we’re not
talking just a little bit. . .we’re talking the
kind of served that you stay awake at
night thinking about it was so bad. . .I was
served straight street.

At first I didn’t recognize the full
extent to which I had been served, but
the more I think about it, the more I now
understand that I was served so bad that
it can only be characterized as off the

, chain. That’s right, I said it...I was

served straight street off the chain.

But the point of this article isn’t to
disclose my own personal serving. . .it is
rather to warn you all of a massive scale
serving that will be dealt to not only ev-
ery single W&L student, but to every-
one in the world. But how could so many
people be served? Who or what is go-
ing to serve you and me so mercilessly?

I will warn you that the information
I am about to divulge will dramatically
and permanently change not only the
way in which you live your life, dear
reader, but the way you view the world.
They are making “You Got Served 2.”

Let the word ring out...there is a
God, and he likes You Got Served. At
first, when I learned of such a glorious
development, I thought that all the serv-
ing that could have been shown in a
movie had clearly been depicted in the
first movie.

But, in fact, there is more serving
to be done. While the movie is far from
going into theatres (you just cannot rush
true art), we can only speculate as to
what will happen in the movie. Who will
get served? Who will be serving? VVill
they incorporate Lil Saint, the young
friend who was tragically killed due to
inner—city violence (I’m thinking a re-
occurring ghost kind of a deal. . .it could
be done really well if the acting is as
good as it was in the first movie)?

While you may watch the movie
solely for the joy of seeing some super-
sweet dance moves, I watch for true
character development. The first movie

, was filled with all the trappings of a great

American film: romance, tragedy,
loss, redemption, friendship, break
dancing, villains, and, most impor-
tantly, break dancing.

While we can only speculate as
to what will happen in the second
film, one thing we can be sure about:
someone is gonna get served. But
perhaps there is something greater to
be learned from the production of
“You Got Served 2.”

At a time when there is much
violence and disruption in the world,
it is truly comforting to know that we
can all come together as people to
enjoy the common fascination of
watching people get served.

Sure, we may disagree as to is-
sues of religion, democracy and the
basic ways of how to live one’s life,
but we all can agree that the only 
more beautiful then happy innocent
children playing or the sight of two
people falling in love is seeing some
sick break dancing moves.

Before I had the privilege of see-
ing “You Got Served,” my life was a
mess. I was so confused that at one
point I thought that I was going to
get a job and start a family when I
got older.

After watching the glorious serv-
ing that was shown, I realized that my
life was to be devoted to starting my
very own dance group to travelling
the country and ﬁghting crime by day
while serving people at night.

I have had to put this dream on
hold until I get this whole college de-
gree thing out of the way, but believe
you me, one day I will be serving
people straight street. That’s right,
be sure to behave because if you’re
bad there is a chance that me and my
crew will have to roll up on you and
serve you straight street, off the chain.

But don’t you worry, you don’t
have to wait until I serve somebody
to see some serving, you can watch
professionals serve other profession-
als in the greatest cinematic event of
this or other century: “You Got
Served 2.”

After watching the glorious serving that

was shown, I realized that my life was to be
devoted to starting my very own dance group
to travel the country and ﬁght crime by day
while serving people at night.

Breka introduces the party characters

ByEkaAkpdc'pmdBreeMellnn

B:E<A

Breka’s back after quite a break and
we have some spring cleaning to do.
When we go out, we encounter some
very interesting fypes of people.

First of all, there are the guys you
run into on your way out. They’ve al-
ready started the drinking and need to
relieve themselves. . .in the parking ga-
rage. Brilliant boys, there are cameras
in the parking garage.

Next, there are the kids you meet
on Traveller, the obvious freshmen with
the visiting relatives. They try to un-
press them by naming every place
they’ve ever partied and point it out as
Traveller passes it. Don’t do that. That’s
armoying.

Alright, so now you’re at the party,
you’ve got a beer in your hand, you look
over to see who just changed the song
on the stereo and find...jumping guy.
Not dancing guy, but jumping guy, fist
in the air as he makes his way through

the party.
Then he goes out the back door

meaniwhile his friend is still at the ste-
reo, he’s a much more mellow drunk.
Peer pressure, however, soon overcomes
his mellowness as jumping guy comes
back in the front door and his friend be-
comes jumping guy, the second.

You leave the craziness inside and
go to find the keg. There you meet over-
share drunk girl. This girl is not only
wasted, but insists on talking to every-
one that walks by the keg, convinced that
she knows them all.

This leads to awkward silence since
the girl really doesn’t know...anyone.
She shares stories from freshman year
while people nod, smile, and slowly
back away. Goodbye, over-share drunk
girl.

Back inside. You find a place on
the couch because all this people-watch-
ing has got you tired. You’re sitting
back, having a nice conversation with
strung out guy, who doesn’t have much
to add to the conversation but at least
he’s entertaining to watch.

Suddenly...you feel a hand strok-
ing your hair gently. You’d like to think
it’s a hottie, but low and behold it’s roll-

ing girl. We don’t mean she’s doing cart-
wheels, we mean she’s doing ecstasy.

You introduce yourself, and while
your attention is on her, strung out guy
gets distracted and disappears. A little
creeped out, you decide to peace out.

Now let’s fast forward 20 years.
Not much has changed, you’re at an
Alumni cocktail party and the types of
people are about the same.

Added to them are the Senators that
make “snaps to them” comments about
how great they are, trophy wives, and
drunken boyfriends that aren’t even al-
ums. Of course you still have your frat
boys that are in the band (look out for
Cho, coming to campus this spring) and
the little frat boys in training with their
khakis and blue blazer.

We would like to end this article by
giving props to the most impressive type
of person we’ve met: Tripp. He’s ready
to schmooze at the Alumni parties and
has mastered the art of introduction. He
had a firm handshake, looked us in the
eye, and made interesting conversation.
Congratulations, four years of W&L
partying has served you well.

Reﬂections on Spring Term

Kristine discusses the ﬁrst week of school after break

ByKrisI'neEa|y

Tl-El»/I.KAl\DCl-EESEGFL

Welcome back to Virginia! I hope
everyone had a lovely time soaking in the
sun...in Destin, of course. Thank
goodness for the NCUR conference to
ease us back into college life.
Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to go see
any presentations. I was too busy working
and (cough, cough) playing for that. A
three—day weekend the very first week
back from break...what a lovely way to
start Spring Term. Thank you
administration for such a rare treat.

And thank you Sigma Chi. You
made my week ﬂy by, despite the fact that
I had 200 pages of reading assigned each
night. And of course, I have to be one of
those extremely driven people that actually
does the reading. (I heard spring term
courses were less demanding. Thanks for
getting me all excited and then bursting
my bubble. I really appreciate it.)

I deprived myself of sleep to
participate in the week’s events, and I
must say I can’t complain.

Sigma Chi, because of you I got the
rare opportunity to throw around a
football. Of course, I didn’t actually get
ﬁeld time. Anything beyond the treadmill

my athletic skills. But I did learn what
“blitzing” is. I plan to pull that out the next
time I meet a football enthusiast. I’ll throw
in “quarterback,” “linebacker,” and
“center” — which thoroughly exhausts my
‘football vocabulary.

Wait! I can add in “halftime” and
“Budweiser commercials.” I’ll sound like
a true Sportscenter fan. I know, I know.
I’m a failure at life. I hail from the land of
brawts, beer and football- the “milk and
cheese” thing is really just a misleading
moniker— and a tree probably has more
authority on the subject.

I must say though, for having so
little arm strength, I wasn’t that abysmal
at chucking it across the ﬁeld. Okay, more
like chucking it ten feet, but considering
an eight year-old could beat me at arm
wrestling, I was pretty proud of myself.

Anyway, mad props (I can write it,
but I think I’d die laughing at myself if I
ever said that out loud). Every srat girl
loves you. Okay, let’s be honest. Every srat
girl loves you even more.

Derby days, an upcoming trip to
Foxfields, not having to obscure my
carefully crafted mixer costumes with a
bulky coat... I couldn’t be more thrilled
that winter can now be put behind us.

 

Most importantly, it’s ﬁnally warm!
We can all put away our medium black
Northface ﬂeece jackets and pull out the
sandals and short-sleeved polo shirts. I am,
admittedly, ready for a new topic among
campus notices. “Lost Speedo. Could be
lying among the rocks in Goshen.” Now
that would be interesting.

The opening of the Ice Cream
Factory also puts a smile on my face. I’m
overjoyed that it is located a good walking
distance from campus. If it were nearby
I’d have to spend an extra few hours in
the gym each week. Just a note: if you want
to get on my good side, I’m a huge fan of
Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup shakes.

If you are at the pink hut anyway
(purchasing ice cream product for your
favorite columnist, of course), be nice and
pick up something for your favorite
senior.

He needs all the sympathy he can
get. Five weeks until you hit the “real”
world, hun. Unless you’ve figured out
some clever plot to avoid it. And if so, you
don’t mind sharing, do you?

Here’s to a wonderful spring term
for those poor seniors and to juniors,
sophomores, and freshman alike. Have
fun, be safe, and try not to lose your
bathing suit.
