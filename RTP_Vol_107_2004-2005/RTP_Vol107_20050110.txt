Groups raise money for Victims of south Asian tsunami

BY SARAH MURRAY
NEWS EDITOR

Students manned tables in
the Commons last week to raise
money for tsunami victims in
South Asia. The effort, which will
continue this week, is a collabo-
ration of Club Asia, SAIL, and the
Center for International Educa-
tion.

’ The group hoped to reach
a goal of $5000 over the entire
period of fundraising. By the end
of their first day, they had over
$1700.

“We were really sur-
prised——I was, at least—at the
responses,” said Assaba Linda
Massougbodji, co—chair of
SAIL’s International Develop-
ment and Relief Group.

The money raised will go
to Habitat for Humanity Intema—
tional to help build shelters for
the millions left homeless by the
tsunami. The organization has
ofﬁces in Sri Lanka, Thailand,
Indonesia, India, Bangladesh,
and Malaysia. Habitat plans to
raise around 25,000 temporary
shelters, which they say can be
built for anywhere from $200 to
$500.

“We wanted to make sure
that it was going to an organiza-
tion that would spend most of it
on the victims,” Massougbodji
said. “We want to locate people
and see where is the money go-
ing, and what’s going on.”

The tables will remain in
the Commons through Wednes-
day. The group accepts cash,
check, and charges on university
swipe cards. Other student or-
ganizations have offered to help
work the tables, including the In-
ternational Law Society, Nabors
Service League, Generals’ Chris-
tian Fellowship, and Joyful
Noise.

The worldwide response
to the tsunami has been just as
wholehearted. Over the past two
weeks, donations from all over
the world have allowed supplies

and workers to arrive in the af— ’

fected area. The American Red
Cross alone has amassed nearly
$150 million in donations since
the Dec. 26 catastrophe.

The response, however,‘

goes beyond immediate help; in— I

temational aid organizations are
preparing to work for the area’s
long—terrn recovery. UNICEF, for
example, has called for $144.5 mil-
lion in donations to beneﬁt the

Anonymous hazing reporting introduced

BY ERIN JULIUS
. ED1TOR—IN—CHIEF

With this year’s pledgeship come new limi-
tations on fraternities.

Inter—Fraternity Council Interim Director
Kevin Weaver, IFC President Tom Pickering,
Director of Leadership Development Burr Datz
and Director of the University Commons Margo
McCliIiton met with fraternity presidents and
new member educators Sunday, January 2 to
discuss changes.

For freshmen, fraternity activities may not
take place between 12 a.m. and 7 a.m. on week-
days and between 2 a.m. and 9 a.m. on week-
ends. Fraternities were also asked to ensure
that their new members are TIPS—trained in
bartending and are required to hold at least 12
hours of study halls a week for their new mem-
bers.

At this meeting, the Dean of Students
Office also revealed a new way to report hazing
allegations. At hazing.wlu.edu, new members
can anonymously report hazing allegations.

Burr Datz also went through hypothetic
cases of hazing to educate the fraternity men
about acceptable behavior.

Washington and Lee concerned with articles and news
portraying W&L in a less than glorious manner

BY KATHERINE SHELL
ASSITANT NEWS EDITOR

Recently, Washington and Lee has been
the subject of questionably negative public-
ity. With the Publication of the Princeton Re-
view listing Washington and Lee as the 2"“
party school in the nation, and with the
Roanoke Times November article on Sexual
Assault on Campus, the W&L community has
become concerned with articles and news por-
traying the university in a less than glorious
manner.

The Princeton Review is
based almost entirely on
student opinions and 
polls. “They contact the *
University early in the “A
process,” said Tim Kolly,
Director of Communica-
tions, for information.

In past years, the University has been
more likely to comply. “We have told them we
are sitting this out,” Kolly said. However, the
response on campus and in the W&L commu-
nity has increased this year with the increase
in rankings.

Do other colleges have as much of a con-
cern for what the Princeton Review says about
them? “I have never heard anything about the
Princeton Review on campus,” says Edward
Wilfung, a student at Wake Forest University.
However, Tim Kolly disagrees with the idea of

 

W&L spending an inordinate amount of time
and money engaging in responses to the
Princeton Review. “I’m not sure that we are
spending that much time on it. We responded
when it first came out,” said Kolly.

“We have no problem with people inter-
viewing this school. They do it to be cute and
sell books. We would like the survey to give
good information to students and parents.
There’s a difference between having fun and
being the 2"“ party school.”

More recently, students were interviewed

VS

about sexual assault on campus after the fig-
ures of the survey were published earlier this
fall. Lorna Golder, ’07, was concerned with
the manner in which she was approached. “I
was the least informed [of the girls inter-
viewed] of what was going on on campus. We
wanted so badly to defend the guys, saying
that they care about their reputation.” In-
stead, Golder was quoted as saying essen-
tially that sexual assault “can be very overt
at times.” ,

Kolly asserts that the University was very

much in charge of who the figures were pub-

'lished to and why. “The sexual assault figures
‘were troubling. The University was under no

compulsion to make the figures public. Once
we had made the decision to release informa-
tion to the students, both newspapers pre-
sented it in an extremely responsible manner,“
said Kolly. “Our approach was to say, we got
these figures, we thought students should have
them. This is a rational problem, these are the
constructive things we are doing about it. We
tried to steer [the reporter] towards campus
leaders who are involved in

reform.”
Though the
Princeton Review re-
porter did interview
campus leaders about
positive methods of end-
ing sexual assault on cam-
pus, he also included stu-
dents with little knowledge as to the exact re-
sponses, Kolly, however, was impressed with
the overall article. “What came out was con-
structive, saying W&L is confronting and solv-

ing this problem,” said Kolly.

However, Golder had a different perspec-
tive. “We all came away from the reporter think-
ing wow-he was poking and prodding for in—
formation he could use,” she says. “I have a
friend who lives in Roanoke. People were call-
ing from Roanoke asking if she had been sexu-
ally assaulted.”

IFC President Tom Pickering said that a
New Member Education committee was formed
last winter. The Committee looked at Cornell
University for ideas about how to deal with
pledgeship and created an online, anonymous
hazing reporting system. “We looked at what
Comell has done and that was one idea,” said
Pickering.

One student appointed by the New
Member Education committee will be helping
to review complaints filed on the website.
“We’ll use a common-sense approach. . .a com-
plaint has to be credible, we’ll need to believe
it actually happen,” Pickering said.

Michael Lee, Chi Psi’s New Member
Educator, said it, “sets a dangerous precedent
to have anonymous reporting of hazing
violations...pledgeship is immediately sus-
pended at the first report of a hazing allega-
tion. It’s tantamount to pre-punishment," he
said.

According to Lee, the new member edu-
cators were told that all anonymously reported
claims would be investigated, “I have a sneak-
ing suspicion that many incredible claims will
be made out of spite, out of a desire for re-
venge,” he said.

personal reasons

EDITOR—IN-CHIEF

Fraternities lost their administrative
leader late last month when Inter-Frater-
nity Council Advisor and Director of Stu-
dent Activities and Greek LifeTodd Tate
resigned.

Dawn Watkins, Dean of Students,
said Tate, “resigned voluntarily” and added
that, “he did a great job while he was
here. . .I will personally miss working with

Tate resigned December 17, 2004 for
personal reasons.

Kevin Weaver, Director of Parent Rela-
tions, is the interim IFC Advisor. Dean .
Watkins said an interim director was ap-
pointed because this is such a busy time of
year for the IFC, so it should not be without
an advisor.

Margo McClinton, Director of the
University Commons and Campus Activi-
ties will be chairing a search for Tate’s re-
placement.

“The search begins immediately,” said
Watkins, and there will be an IFC Advisor,
“hopefully by June or July.”

Todd Tate could not be reached for
comment.

Reasonableness called for
during this pledgeship

Pledgeship can be a dangerous
time for freshman and it is prudent
for the Administration to take such
proactive steps as creating a website
where students can report hazing
anonymously. This year, both the
Administration and fraternities need
to act reasonably. -

Anonymous reporting of hazing
violations could easily get out of
hand. Campus sentiment seems to
be that false reports will be submit-
ted due to inter-house rivalries and
freshmen unhappy with the way re-.
cruitment went. The Administration
should understand this concern, and
treat every claim seriously but
should also be wary of the fact that
there is potential for abuse.

Underground hazing is another
frightening possibility. If fraternities
cannot have their pledges pull harm-
less pranks publicly, or take road
trips for pledge class bonding, they
may instead engage in more secret,
and thus dangerous activities. And
even though the anonymous site is a
good step, many pledges feel a strong
loyalty to their houses and will prob-
ably not snitch.

The bottom line is that
pledgeship, or the new member edu-
cation period, is a time for pledge
class bonding and fraternities will
want their new pledges to partici-
pate in group activities. To an ex-
tent, pledge class bonding is accept-
able and necessary for a strong
Greek organization to continue. The
Administration must understand this,
and use common sense in dealing
with hazing violation reports. Fra-
ternities, in turn, need to act reason-
ably and not take advantage of the
Administration’s common-sense ap-
proach.

Rush week as seen from the inside-
one Recruitment Chair’s experience

file photo

SRAT STRESS. Sorority rush for the 2004-05 school year proved to be overwhelming for nearly everyone involved, pledges and active sisters alike.

Recruitment week 2005... my third year
and yet it still surprises me. Like college ad-
missions it seems that we do the best we can,
try to sell ourselves with as much show, and
hopefully truth, as possible, and then just
cross our fingers as hope for the best.

From where I stand, I think this year went
exceedingly well and I adore all our new
women. I would
also like to thank the other
sorority recruitment chairs
for being wonderful to work
with!

I don’t honestly know
that much about fraternity rush week, as I have
(a) never participated in it and (b) been busy
with sorority rush, so most of my comments
are aimed towards the female population of
the campus. - -

This past week has been a blur, maybe
that’s because of the activity level, or maybe
the lack of sleep.

In five days I have managed to drop a
ream of paper on my hand (both embarrassing
and painful), staple my dominant hand (don’t
ask how), and somehow succeed in making
my apartment look like my closet just threw-
up, while only spending time to sleep there.

Apparently, if you start the season around

I have not read a newspaper in over a

it was worth.

Exam week was less stressful than this
past week. As one of my sorority sisters put
it, “Class is where you go to get a break from
setting up the sorority house.”

And keep in mind that we
here at W&L run a no—frills re-
cruitment, which means I didn’t
have to instruct my chapter to
cut out 5,000 snowﬂakes and
hang them from the ceiling or
build a giant cloud out of chicken wire. Thank
goodness for that!

But we do have to sing very loudly, while

you judge just try it and see how much you

I also don’t think it’s possible for the
Rho Gammas (which I will forever call Rho
Chis) to thoroughly prepare their halls for
how loud the singing really is.

Hey, at least we didn’t have to deal with
snow! Of course the weather decided to take
an alternate turn and we had to worry about
people almost passing out instead.

EVERYONE is complaining about how short it is, but it
seems like nothing is actually«being done about it. Who’s in charge of this
sort of thing? I sympathize; when you have to ﬂy to San Diego and back on
each end of the measly two weeks, it kinda sucks. Comparable institutions
often give out a MONTH of \Vinter Break, although they don’t have Spring
Tenns, granted. But don’t we deserve at least three weeks?

who work at those places in Lex don’t compare to the excellent people who
work at the Cafe and the Marketplace.
Todd Tate-B Not even gonna touch this one.

Tom Cruise-ll Overheard— “He’s so not cute anymore.”

Just because we study the past there doesn’t mean. that
our professors should be relegated to using educational technology FROM
the past. More smart classrooms! And what happened to the moon mural? ‘

Not having the ability to turn on the air—con—
ditioning was a nice little touch. I’m not com-
plaining, as I actually enjoy recruitment week,
but simply writing my observations.

So there you have it, just a few little in-
sider thoughts on the past few days. I could
have made it sappy explaining how much I
adore spending time with my sisters (which is
true) and how much I love meeting all these
new people (also true), but that would be
about as interesting to read as watching some-
one iron.

So to conclude, I guess I’m going to say
I’m glad it’s over for this year. Panhellenic
rules can seem silly, but they are there for a
reason and I’m glad that I can now break them.

Guys, I wish you all the luck with

Congress must not block Alberto

Gonzales’ Attorney-General appointment

John Ashcroft’s likely successor, Alberto
Gonzales, is currently before the Senate Judiciary
Committee, and is, at the present moment, facing
some extremely pointed questions from both Re-
publicans and Democrats.

Abraham Lincoln once remarked, doubtless
with no small degree of either cynicism or sincer-
ity, “if both factions, or neither, shall abuse you,
you will probably be about right.
Beware of being assailed by one
and praised by the , other.”
Gonzales is a man who has been
rather harshly critiqued by fire-
breathers on both the right and the left, and thus,
having such a high opinion of Mr. Lincoln as I do, I
believe he is about right.

Most of the controversy stems from his career
from 1999 and onward. In 1999, he was appointed as
a justice of the Supreme Court of Texas. During his
time on the Texas court, he made a few rulings that
dealt with that aiways-delightful topic, abortion. The
most important of these was a case wherein he ruled
with the court majority that not all Texan teenagers
seeking abortions would have to go through a pro-
cess of parental notiﬁcation. This has drawn the
harshest criticism from pro—lifers. Judie Brown of the
‘American Life League said— “choosing not to rule
against abortion, in any situation, is the epitome of
denying justice for an entire segment of the American
population- pre-bom babies in the womb.” Gonzales
himself is reportedly pro—life, but his stated reason-
ing for ruling to strike down parental notification

Letter to the Editor

MODERATE’S MUSINGS
CALEY ANDERSON ‘06

shows the ﬂaws in the rabid pro-lifers’ thinking:

“My own personal feelings about abortion
don’t matter...the qyestion is, what is the law, what
is the precedent? Sometimes, interpreting a statue,
you may have to uphold a statute that is personally
offensive to you. But as a judge, that’s your job.”

Gonzales, in other words, may feel one way or
the other about issues, but he’s not going to inject
his personal opinion into his inter-
pretation of the law, which he’s try-
ing to keep as objective as possible,
it seems. I respect that in a person,
but especially in a judge. Ithink that
his unwillingness to bow to political pressure to mis-
interpret the law is a huge positive that will make him
a great Attomey—General, and certainly an improve-
ment on his predecessor.

On the other end of the political aisle, some Demo-
crats would like to shift part of the blame for the Iraqi
torture scandal onto his shoulders. Since 2001 ,
Gonzales has served as Counsel to the President; ba-
sically he’s the President’s private legal advisor. Dur-
ing that time, there’s strong circurnstancial evidence
that he helped to push for a narrower redefinition of
torture as “excruciating and agonizing pain.”

In his hearing, Gonzales has acknowledged that
he took part in the administration’s discussions on
the matter, but has vehemently denounced any cur-
rent support of alterations to the Geneva Conven-
tion, saying that he fully supports the older, more
rigorous definition of torture, calling his earlier ac-
tions sirnply “preliminary,” not anything which he

MIT Grad offers outside
perspective on W&L
“affirmative action”

Dear Editor,

The Ring-tum Phi of No-
vember 15th published
something of a front—page
interdict from the W&L Stra-
tegic Directions Committee.
Addressed “To the Student
Body”, it excepted sharply
to certain student participa-
tions in a recent facilitated
discussion session. All
Committee members signed
it, under the lead signature
of Provost Tom Williams.

The Committee re-
proached certain utterances
made about minority student
representation at W&L, call-
ing them “racist”, “insensi-
tive”, “uninformed”, “un-
worthy”, “dishonorable”,
“inaccurate”, “uncivil”,
“false” and “baseless”. Yet
that passion did not keep
some of the Committee’s
own assertions from sound-
ing as puerile as what was
attributed to the students.

For example, the Com-
mittee disputed the idea that
the goal of diversity has re-

sulted in a disproportionate
number of minority students
in the bottom quartile of the
entering class. But it offered
not a statistic nor datum in
defense of that position.

It also asserted that “A
classroom and community
with varied experiences and
backgrounds is a better
learning space than one
made up of a homogeneous
population”. Yet however
that accords with tenets of
political correctness, it is an
insensitive (and even dan-
gerous) affront to what we
accept as literate societies
in nations like Finland and
Japan.

The Committee de-
scribed as beneficial and
wise “efforts to bring diver-
sity of thought and experi-
ence to the W&L student
body”. Yet the veracity of
this aside, persons in this
modern age apprehend that
pious pleas for diversity are
routinely used to conceal
and shepherd along the di-
visive figure of race-based
Affirmative Action.

For race-based Affirma-
tive Action is manifestly
what the Committee pro-
poses for W&L. And while

one hesitates to declare the
Committee naive, its pre-
sumption that this is benefi-
cial ignores the strife and
discord Affirmative Action
has already brought to
scores of colleges and uni-
versities._

The Committee’s rigid
determination to implement
Affirmative Action probably
explains too the most dis-
quieting aspect of its com-
munication. For there is in
its temper and tone, and in
its construction as an
outfling against offending
students, something out-
side the grace of George
Washington, or the dignity
of Robert Lee.

Its peremptory tone
seems conducive less to
dispassionate debate than
to some tract propounding a
moral lesson. Its disparaging
phrases assail doubting stu-
dents and their contending
remarks. Its unshakable
premise is that a dichotomy
exists between persons of
decency and those unsworn
to Affirmative Action. And
asits sentences grow to
stem dicta, students realize
what they are to think — or
else.

The problem seems to be
that the Strategic Directions
Committee advocates (in
earnest) what is being ever
more pilloried as sociologi-
cal dogma. Its members thus
become proselytizers, whose
fury descends upon any ob-
jections to their policy, even
those voiced with the utmost
propriety. The urgency to
squelch debate on a policy
for which we find more in-
stances of failure than suc-
cess is notably disturbing,
and inimical to the expansive
intellectual atmosphere and
discourse of a University.

One can only wonder
whether diversity of opinion
existed within the Commit-
tee, whose members act in
such concert on a controver-
sial policy. And one wonders
too how W&L embarks with-
out pause upon a policy
begging for scrutiny stron-
ger than that from question-
ing students in a discussion
group.

The great pity is that the
Committee seems blind to
the possibility that some in-
tractable sociological prob-
lems owe more to the effects
of 10,000 years of human his-
tory than to the utterances

of students in a discussion

Avenues exist for the
Committee to improve W&L,
but race-based Affirmative
Action will not help a Uni-
versity built upon any tra-
dition of excellence. It may
help some minority stu-
dents, admittedly, at the
greater expense of others.
Yet still, and to that minor-
ity, nothing could better af-
firm a projection to make
them objects of unspoken
scorn than some race-based
Affirmative Action program.

Finally, the Committee
might give thought to what
effect its unprecedented in-
trusion will have on future
student participations in fa-
cilitated discussion groups.
For with whatever good it
intended its communication
of November 15th, it has un-
doubtedly paid a price for
an impulsive breach of pre-
scribed administrative
disinvolvement in student
discussion sessions.

BY MARSHALL RULE
SPORTS EDITOR

Every Lady General got a bucket against
Mary Baldwin on Tuesday, January 4. The
final score was 79-56 and was an important
game to keep the winning streak alive.

Sophomore sensation Jessica
Hunsinger said, “It was a good win and
things are really coming together well.”

The team hopes to extend their winning
streak to 5 games when they play Roanoke on
Tuesday. The game should prove to be inter-
esting. Washington and Lee has never de-
feated Roanoke, but they are optimistic that
the drought will end on Tuesday.

“The Roanoke team was at our game
against Hollins,” Hunsinger said, “We could
tell they were a little worried.”

Students learn Hollywood lingo

BY ELYSE MooDY
STAFF WRITER

Most students spent their exam week locked inside the
library, cramming for finals and leaving only for quick runs to
the CoOp for coffee. Several W & L students, however, spent
their last couple of days here running away from an alien at-
tack in the hills of Staunton. '

The Steven Spielberg movie War of the Worlds spent four
days filming here before Christmas break, between December
13 and 16. Junior Meg Strother says the experience was amaz-
ing, “definitely worth getting up at 3:30am, braving the 16 de-
gree weather and pushing back my exams!” With lows in the
mid-20’s every day, everyone involved nearly froze to death as
we learned the meanings of “background action” and “reset”——
terms that I came to know well. This means that you go back to
the beginning of the scene and you do it all over again, exactly
the same as the last shot.

We spent Wednesday morning, from 4:00 am until 11:30
pm walking over the same stretch of hillside, at least a mile
away from the camera. Thursday morning was a repeat of
Wednesday's schedule—another day of mindless walking for
most people involved. For those of you who are in it, it will be
amazing to be able to identify yourself as that brown blob in
the middle of the hill.

Although there were over two hundred extras, the costum-
ing and make-up departments paid incredible attention to each
and every person’s appearance. People were made to look ex-
actly as if they had just survived an apocalyptic experience.
Meg adds, “it was incredible to see the attention paid to every
detail... I was shocked when a lady freaked out that I had curly
blond hair and told me to hurry to the hair and makeup tent
where people could ‘get those curls out.’

I was just one refugee among hundreds, so far from the
camera, yet they cared that my hair was curly.” Even at an
incredible distance from the camera, extras were given the op-
portunity to feel important, as if the way they looked mattered
to the overall presentation of the movie onscreen.

The location was chosen because it is absolutely breath-
taking. Staunton, VA is a beautiful place at 4:00 in the morning
when the sun is coming up over the hills. I was lucky enough
to be a mere six feet away from'Mr. Cruise (1 almost died) and he
kept telling the camera crew to hurry and set up because the
light was so amazing. It was also incredible to see director
Steven Spielberg in action.

He literally involved himself in every shot in which I par-
ticipated. It was just amazing to see such a famous director in
action, working so closely with the movie-making process. Dur-
ing one scene, he actually rode on a moving camera vehicle,
careening down a hill in front of Hummers and screaming refu-
gees, to get a shot. Amazing.

Most of the scenes were shot near an old farmhouse and
barn facility (Tim Robbins’ house in the movie), where a pond

and large hill opposite the house made fog possible and com-
pleted the landscape. The movie requires such a setting be-
cause the alien invasion is supposed to be taking place on the
other side of a large hill—the house in the valley is separated
from the battle by a small rise of land. We spent afternoons
and evenings running like crazy up and down this hill, to-
wards and away from the battle.

The battle scene itself will be added in with studio foot-
age and CGI. Unfortunately, there were no aliens present dur-
ing the shoot, but there. were lots of military vehicles and the
sounds of jet planes overhead to add to the excitement.

As extras, the production team kept all of the extras in a
tent far away from the set. Luckily, it was heated, and they
provided us with two catered meals a day. Coffee was abun-
dant; it became highly necessary to function in 20-degree
weather after a 15-hour day of work. The days were long, but
it was worth it.

The movie, War of the Worlds, is the highest-budgeted
movie in film history thus far, and trailers are already advertis-
ing it as an action movie of epic proportions. It is scheduled
for release in late June 2005. Definitely plan to see it; you will
probably be able to spot many of your classmates!

PLEDGED

    

 

 

taxman Rom

After the national ofﬁce forbade locals from cooperaung with
Alexandra Robbins, she disguised herselfas an undergad
and found four sorority women willing to risk expulsion to

help her. While Robbins structures her narrative around the

year's ritual cycle-the rush, the bid, pledging, Initiation,
Greek Week, etc.—the timeless soap opera of sorority life
occupies center stage.

Pledged combines a sharp-eyed narrative with extensive
reporting and the ﬂy—on—the-wall voyeurism of reality shows
to provide an unprecedented look at the inner workings of a
college sorority. A fascinating read for upper-class srat vets,

new pledges, curious independents, or even the occasional
frat boy with a serious thirst for knowledge.

Strait’s newest release offers classic country favontes

BY EMILY EDWARDS
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

My current CD obsession, aside from Lindsay Lohan’s
Speak, is George Strait’s 50 Number Ones. Let me just preface
this by saying that I live for and love country music. People
call me a country music jukebox. I have done crazy things just
to get into a Brooks and Dunn concert. My hometown, Mem-
phis, sometimes gets a bad “rap” for being the anti-country
music city. We are, after all, the birthplace of Three-Six-Mafia
and its offshoot Project Pat. The top-rated radio stations in
Memphis are our two hip-hop s'tations. So it’s probably a
wonder that I am obsessed with the likes of Keith Urban, Brad
Paisley, and Tim McGraw.

50 Number Ones is a phenomenal collection of George
Strait’s biggest hits, but I had no idea that he sang songs such
as “Oceanfront Property” and “You Know Me Better Than
That” (two of my favorites). If you’re in the marathon mood

for 51 great country songs (it includes his latest single, “I Hate
Everything”), this CD is a must have.

These days, many CDs sound alike. I bought a Lonestar
CD recently, and I swear that Track 1 sounded exactly like Track
10. We need variety. And by variety, I don’t mean all songs
being about beaches and margaritas. Thank you, Kenny
Chesney.

Strait’s CD offers listeners a variety of songs. There are

I the drinking songs that Alan Jackson does so well, there are

the cheesy love songs, and there are also the songs that make
you want to get up and do a Texas-two-step. After my 700 mile

drive back to-Lexington after Christmas break, I can attest that

this is a fantastic driving CD. After all, if George Strait “hangs
his hat in Tennessee,” he can’t be all that bad. ‘

And on a side note, please don’t thinkless of me for buy-
ing that Lindsay Lohan CD. I had too much to drink on New
Year’s Eve and was hung over when I bought it. Call it a severe
lack of judgment. '

Napoleon Dynamite: the best thing to come out of Idaho since the potato

Now that 2004 has come to a close, I can
finally report on who was a winner and who
was a loser, or as I like to call them, 2004’s
spuds and duds.

Britney Spears definitely
made a run at dud of the millen-
nium by not only putting on a
few pounds, but getting
married. . .twice.

Now the girl that had it all
has been photographed grab-
bing her husbands “special area” on a bal-
cony. Britney has shown the world that any-
one can be the girl next door one day and a
social outcast the next.

While we are on good looking teenie pop
stars, I should mention Jessica Simpson. Jes-
sica found her
niche as a really
hot virgin ditz,
and while she
may not have the
V card, she hasn’t
lost the hotness
or the ditziness,
and two out of
three ain’t bad.
Spud for Jessica.

All younger siblings can relate to the pain-
ful life of Ashlee Simpson. I mean this poor
girl has never had anything handed to her and
has had to work for everything. She is get-

MARSHALL RULE

 

ting by on pure talent and has never been
accused of riding her sister’s coattail. Even a
bad case of acid “reflex” couldn't keep her
down. Sorry, I don’t buy it.... Dud.

On campus this year, there
were plenty of duds and spuds to
give out. Ithinkwe all know who is
getting the first dud. . ..

That’s right, the administra-
tion. I could sit here and com-
plain about drinking and give
statistical proof that this will cause DUI’s, but
that’s not why they’re getting the dud. They
get the dud because they have successfully
driven a wedge between not only the faculty
and students, but also between some of the
alumni and parents who aren’t exactly yelling
in support of the
changes.

‘ The other
big Dud goes to
Panhellenic. All
year you force
sororities to ad-
here to ridiculous
rules regarding
freshmen, and
then when it is
your turn to shine and have formal rush, you
blow it. Panhel, it’s not you, it’s the system.
So until you change how freshmen girls rush,
you will have to deal with being called a dud.

“When you see me, give me wide berth...”

New sorority girl reflectsu

I’m sorry if my article is ridden with typos and
grammatical errors (though I am sure my wonderful
editors will spot them before the Ring-Tum Phi goes
to print). I am writing on less than two hours of
sleep. Surely you can forgive me if there is an extra
comma or a run-on sentence or two.

I tried to sleep last night. I really did. However,
the kitchen chairs in my sorority house, although
well padded, are not quite as

I was going to take a header straight down the
stairs in front of sixty sorority women.

Sound like an irrational fear? Oh, but it isn’t.
See, I»come from a long line of klutzes. Trace my
ancestors back a few thousand years and I guar-
antee you they were stubbing their toes on the
newly invented wheel. My great, great grandfa;
ther almost fell overboard off the Mayflower.

Alright, I really have no evi-

comfortable as my own bed. My THE MILK AND CHEESE GIRL dence of that. But it sounds
back aches. I have a headache. I reasonable enough to me.
want to crawl into bed and stay KRISTINE EARLY Truly, Iamlike abull in

there for the rest of the day. How-

a china shop. I am glad that

ever, I am sitting in the radio station playing
Sernisonic to a nonexistent audience (Tune in to
“The K Spot” at 11 am on Saturdays. Yes, I know. I
am making a shameless plug. But I’m okay with
that.)

However, I am not complaining. Because last
night I may have slept on kitchen chairs, but I was
sleeping in a sorority house. My sorority house... I
am part of a sorority. I still can’t believe it. I imagine
something of this magnitude takes awhile to sink
in. I’m guessing that by the time I receive my di-
ploma I will have come to the terms with the fact
that I am now legitimately a srat girl. Yes, I have
already rocked the pearls for a full semester, but
now, I can wear them with a newfound pride.

Rush week is the worst week EVER. Yes, I’m
stating the obvious. I admit to spending many
nights tossing and turning under the covers, to
participating in full out freak out sessions with my
friends, and to needlessly analyzing my every move
all week. I’m not ashamed. Because I bet if you are
a freshman (or an awesome sophomore or junior)
you were doing the exact same things.

Normally, I am “pretty chill.” I try not to let
things get under my skin. But this week was prob-
ably the most stressful period of my life (Yes, more
stressful than exam week!) Why was I so scared?
Well, besides the obvious, frankly, I was afraid that

I’m not heavy because this limits the amount of
damage I can do. You know those teen movies in
which everything goes wrong for the heroine?
She trips in front of the entire school at gradua-
tion. She makes a fool of herself during a date due
to her severe lack of coordination. Well, I’m the
heroine. Unfortunately, Freddie Prince Jr. and
Topher Grace are too booked to make an appear-
ance in my movie.

Seriously, I can manage to trip over anything.
In fact, I can trip over absolutely nothing. And I do
so with a frequency that is truly disturbing. Were
you aware that it is possible to trip up the stairs?
Probably not. lt’s a skill, believe me.

Ice and I: we just don’t mix. No matter how
much I concentrate on walking, I always manage to
slip. Usually I can catch myself before I do a com-
plete nosedive. Usually. Maneuvering through the
d-hall is always a treat. I dread the day when I will
make a rnisstep and send my tray ﬂying. I’m sure it
will happen soon enough. Even door frames are my
enemy. I can’t seem to judge distance and I’ve
knocked my hip on them a few thousand times.

And did I mention that I am really good at
knocking over glasses? Especially if they’re full.
The number of times I’ve whacked my arm on a
piece of furniture... we’re talking the Guinness
World Book of Records here. By the way, why do

dud of the year.
When it came down
to making the decision, it was a close one,
between Martha Stewart and the Jackson fam-
ily, but, in the end, Whacko Jacko helped pro-
pelled his family over the top. Janet had a
wardrobe malfunction and Mikey molested
little Mikey. And I don’t even want to know
what Tito has been up to lately.

But 2004 will always be known as the year
that put Idaho on the map. A movie came out
that was able to epitomize life in the Gem State.
And if you don’t know what movie I am talk-

they call it the funny bone? I don’t derive any sort
of amusement out of ramming my elbow against a
hard surface. It hurts. A lot. I’m not a masochist.

Boy did fate play a cruel trick on me. Not only
am I clumsy but it doesn’t help the situation that I
have fair skin and I bruise easily. I need only tap
against something and I turn black and blue.
In fact, as a klutz, I have lots of concerns. I have
never driven a car under the inﬂuence, nor do I
ever plan to. But I dread being put through a sobri-
ety test even when my blood alcohol level is a solid
point 0. Me, walk in a straight line? Haha. I waver
around like a drunkard before I even take a sip of
rum

However, there is a sad, sad truth to this story.
I am the most coordinated person in my family. Yes,

For a movie that cost roughly $400,000
to make, it didn’t do too badly, taking inde-
pendent theaters by storm despite the lack of
a plot line. ‘

Fans have gone Napoleon crazy and have
embraced Idaho as more than just the state

gets worse with future generations? I fear for my
great grandchildren’s lives. Will they be able to
walk from one side of the room to the other without
destroying something?

When I was younger, I used to be mortified by
my own maladroitness, but I’ve learned to adapt.
I’ll never be Michelle Kwan or Keri Strug, so why
try? The only thing I can do is laugh at myself. And
boy, do I provide myself (and others) a great deal
of amusement.

So when you see me, give me wide berth. If

not, I may just run into you. That is, if I don’t trip .
