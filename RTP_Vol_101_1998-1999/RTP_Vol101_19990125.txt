“Hill presents
~ arking plan

‘Trustees will vote on latest plan next
month, construction set for spring

By Polly Doig

g NEWS EDITOR

Washington and Lee University
gave the Lexington Planning Commis-
sion a sneak preview of the latest pro-

gposal for its parking garage last Thurs-
day.

Construction was originally sched-
uled to begin on the garage in Octo-
ber, but has been pushed back to this

‘spring, with a goal of completion next
January.
“We found the original plans un-
acceptable; they called for a ﬁve-story
I structure that was too tall for the loca-
tion and would not have ﬁt well with
the rest of the campus,” Lawrence
Broomall, W&L’s vice president for ﬁ-
nance, said. The newest plans have
Nbeen designed to blend with W&L’s
classic revival architecture, according
to Alan Wilson of the Haskell Com-
pany, a Florida-based design ﬁrm.
Construction will cause the tempo-
' rary loss of an estimated 120 - 130

spaces in this area, thus cramping
parking conditions. W&L’s Director of
Planning Frank Parsons urged plan-
ning board members to “keep your eye
on the prize.” Parsons contends that
the parking deck will alleviate parking
problems downtown and on the W&L
campus when completed.

The garage has been plagued with
design problems from the outset. This
latest plan calls for a four-story, 612-
space parking garage that will be lo-
cated where the Upper and Lower Gym
parking lots are currently located. The
garage will have an elevator and stair-
way tower.

A looped walkway will let pedestri-
ans reach the parking garage, the
plarmed sorority houses and the main
campus.

The proposal will be put before the
Board of Trustees next month for a
ﬁnal decision. Pending approval, the
proposal will go before the Planning
Commission and the Lexington City
Council.

_Maya Angelou
‘tickets go fast

Tickets given out in four hours, leaving
many students on the outside looking in

' By Polly Doig

NEWS EDITOR

It took more than three weeks for
CONTACT to contract Maya Angelou.
It took less than four hours for tickets
to be distributed.

“We had given out all the tickets
by 1 1:50 a.m. of the second day,” CON-

y TACT President Jason Hahn said.

Due to the high demand for tickets,
the lecture will be simulcast live in
Newcomb 9, Williams School 221 and
327, Lewis Hall classroom C, Northen
Auditorium and two other classrooms
in Leybum Library. Tickets will not be
distributed for the simulcast locations,
but students will be seated on a first-

1; come, ﬁrst-serve basis.

Angelou, who comes with a $27,000
price tag for a one-hour performance,
was paid in part by CONTACT, PRIDE,

‘ the MSA, the Office of the Dean of

the College and the Office of the Presi-
dent. Overall, CONTACT spent less
than half of its $_47,000 budget for this
year on Angelou.

~ “There won’t be a formal reception,”

Hahn said. “However, she’ll be meet-
ing beforehand with sponsoring
groups.”

Angelou’s contract also comes

“ with several specifications.

“According to her contract, there
can be no professional ﬂash equip-
ment aﬁer the first ﬁve minutes,” Hahn
said. “My understanding is that it’s
pretty dynamic, so I would imagine
that to have ﬂash photography dur-
ing the performance would be pretty
disturbing. However, we can’t make a
recording of the event.”

Halm said that Angelou is expected
to give an unconventional speech, in-
cluding reading from her writings and
explaining what they mean to her.

“She won’t be taking any ques-
tions,” Hahn said. “She feels, based
on past experience, that questions just
don’t ﬁt with the type of performance
that she gives. It’s not your standard
45 minute lecture, followed by ques-
tioning at the end. It’s much more dy-
namic.”

CONTACT has alsoconﬁrmed sev-
eral other speakers to come within the
next few months. Taylor Branch, a pre-
eminent historian, will give a lecture
on Feb. 3 entitled, “Martin Luther
King, Jr.: The architecture of a social
movement.”

On Feb. 11, Bill Johnston ’61, the
president of the New York Stock Ex-
change will give a free lecture. And
former MTV video jockey Kennedy
will speak on March 1 1.

Mock Con goes to Washington

Prominent California Rep. Chris Cox

thinks, and out step. . . George Wash-
ington and Robert E. Lee?

This is what happens, boys and
girls, when 13 Washington and Lee
University students escape classes

for a few days in order to promote
Mock Convention 2000 in Washing-
ton, D.C.

“We ﬁgured it would be a great op-
portunity to publicize Mock Con and
make contacts,” said media chair Sean
Eddy. “We had a banner with our logo
and contact information, and hired
George Washington and Robert E. Lee
look-alikes who spoke.”

“Shattered Images,” a student thesis one-act written by senior Alyssa Sellers and directed by junior Holly
Estes, opens Friday, Jan. 29 for a one-night performance at the Lenfest Center. When asked to describe the
thought process behind “Shattered Images,” Sellers said, “This play is about more than eating disorders 

it’s a struggle to maintain control and achieve perfection, something everyone can relate to at some level.”

jnua 29, 1999

According to
Eddy, the Mock
Con planners
who went to D.C.
for the annual

winter meeting of the Republican Na-
tional Committee made some valuable
contacts, including Steve Forbes, Dan
Quayle and Tom DeLay.

But the biggest surprise for Eddy
was the fact that, in some cases, they
were preaching to the converted.

“A lot of people already knew our
reputation for accurate prediction in
presidential races,” Eddy said. “It was
nice to see that people recognize us.
Steve Forbes was very interested in us.”

Currently, Mock Con is courting
speakers for the spring kickoff, which
will be held April 26-28. According to

Eddy, possible speakers for that event
include Gov. George W. Bush (R-Tex.),
former Red Cross president Elizabeth
Dole, Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona),
entrepreneur Steve Forbes and former
Vice President Dan Quayle.

Mock Con’ers sent out more than
150 press releases to various media in
an attempt to increase awareness of
their purpose.

“We have a lot of ideas to make it
more modern than the actual conven-
tion itself,” Eddy said. “We just want
to convey our message to the student
body and to the nation at large.”

Covington wrote “Salvation on
Sand Mountain: Snake Handling and
Redemption in Southern Appalachia”
(Addison-Wesley, 1995) about the
culture of that area after covering the
trial of Glenn Surrirnerﬂeld for The New
York Times. He explores the peculiar
practices and social realities of these
people and traces his own Appalachian
roots.

“Salvation on Sand Mountain” was
a fnialist for the National Book Award

Taylor Branch, winner of the Pulitzer
prize for his book “Parting the Waters:
America in the King Years 1954-63,”
will give a talk in Lee Chapel on
Wednesday, Feb. 3 at _7:30 p.m.

The title of his lecture is “Martin
Luther King Jr.: The Architecture of a
Social Movement.”

Branch, who will spend several
days on the W&L campus meeting
with various classes, published his
second book in his King trilogy last
year, “Pillar of Fire: America in the King
Years 1963-65.”

In an interview with The New York
Times about this book, Branch ex-
plained that he had planned to become
a surgeon until that fateful day in 1963
when Police Commissioner T. Eugene
“Bull” Connor turned his wrath on civil
rights demonstrators. “Seeing dogs
loosened on eight-year-olds changed
the direction of my life,” he said.

Branch is also author of “Laby-
rinth” and “The Empire Blues and Sec-

ond Wind: The Memoirs of an Opin-
ionated Man,” and he has written ex-

tensively for “The New York Times
Magazine,” “Sport,” “Esquire” and
“The New Republic.” Branch is a ﬁ'iend

in C-school

A show of paintings and drawings
entitled “I’ll Tell You In Time,” by
Carolyn Capps is currently on display
in the Williams School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics. The show
runs through Feb. 28.

Capps’ work, perhaps reflective of
her Southern roots, is narrative in that
it portrays people in various settings
and in various psychological states in-
teracting with the viewer.

“My aim,” Capps said, “is to create
works that are complex enough to in-
terest the most sophisticated viewer

‘Hell no, he Won’t go

,-

According to some polls, Bill
Clinton’s approval rating is at 76 per-
cent.

It’s time for the Republicans to
count their losses and get back to
work. They are digging themselves
into a hole that’s going to lead them
right out of ofﬁce.

They may think they’re trying the
President on charges of perjury, but
America still sees it as a sexual witch
hunt

The American people think
Clinton’s sleazy, but they don’t care.
Their marketwatch.com stock just went
up 500 percent.

The people really haven’t cared
about Clinton’s problems from the "be-
ginning. Pot-smoking, draft-evading,
Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate and
Paulagate all made news before the
1996 election. Clinton still won.

I know the issue should not be
about Clinton’s approval rating. But
popularity is what politics are really
about. In the end, it will all come down
to that.

It’ s not that I think the Republicans
should cop out. It’s not a cop out to
give up on something that never had
much merit from the beginning.

Clinton is a lawyer. A brilliant one
at that. The prosecutors in the Paula
Jones trial — not quite that bright.
They accepted the convoluted def'mi-
tion of sexual relations that has
haunted the nation ever since. Clinton
answered like any lawyer would.

Clinton might be slimy, but what
defendant in a sexual harassment
trial would say to the prosecutor, “I
think your definition of sexual rela-
tions is much too narrow. You can’t
even imagine the things we did to-
gether?”

From the beginning, Clinton-sup-
porters viewed the Jones case as a Re-
publican-motivated witch hunt. Why
would Clinton hand himself over to his
predators if he didn’t ne‘ed_to‘.7‘“ _

His use of lawyer-eeze might beﬁ-
diculous, but prosecutors should have
been prepared. They know what he
was about. They asked the wrong
questions.

Members of the House decided that
they cared much more about the next
step of the process, though —— the
grand jury.

In the grand jury testimony,
Clinton fully admits to an improper
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
That is all that should have been in
question. No one, not even Kenneth
Star, needed to know Monica and

Bill’s every move.

The charges of suboming perjury
with his staff would not hold weight
in a court of law. They shouldn’t in a
political trial, either.

Betty Curie insists that Clinton did
not ask her to lie. Clinton agrees. Who
is there to say definitively otherwise.
There is no actual evidence. That

L

  
 
 
  
 

doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, but
they should not be able to remove
the president from office on the
grounds of circumstantial evidence.
In this case they cannot prove he
committed a high crime or misde-
meanor. L ‘ '

‘He shouldlnot go down in history
as the first American President to be
thrown out of office.

If the Senate does convict, the
Republican Party will have to be
ready for a gigantic public backlash.
Larry Flint won’t be the only citizen
paying millions to get dirt on the
sexual pasts of the GOP.

They’ve already opened the pro-
verbial can of worms. If they convict,
it will only get worse.

The media hailstorm of amoral poli-
tics will only get more Jerry Springer-
ized. That’s the last thing we need.

quickly to light. And it’s not just who
is on it; it’s also who isn’t. Alter glanc-

I’m not sure I liked what I saw. -

ODK was founded at Washington

1914, by 15 student and faculty lead-

site, “Student membership candidates

scholarship of their school or college

one of five areas: scholarship; athlet-

person, both as a member of the col-
lege community and as a contributor
to a better society.” Dean of Students
David Howison said that ODK wants
leaders from all ﬁelds, but that the
g.p.a. cutoff can hurt people.

“There are nominees who are im-
mensely qualified, but their grades just
aren’t up to the standards,” Howison
said.

That raised a big question for me:
who decides? How does one get cho-
sen for this illustrious honor? The web
site doesn’t say. Howison said that
the grade point average cutoff for the
group is strict, so all juniors and se-
niors in the right g.p.a. bracket are
automatically considered for the
group. Nominees from students and
faculty are also considered. Who con-
siders them? Why, a committee of ex-

isting members, of course!

Remove Clinton now

As the nation has been engulfed by
the media frenzy surrounding one of the
largest presidential scandals in history,
the American people have grown weary,
frustrated and much too eager to put an
end to the Clinton’ matter by the easiest
means possible.

Impeachment is certainly not the easi-
est or most desirable method for restor-
ing order to our chaotic political envi-
ronment, but it is the only way.

If one looks past all of the sordid,
sexual details and ﬂagrant bipartisan at-
tacks, both of which are abundant, one

can see the true foundation for the case
against the president: Bill Clinton has
purposefully and premeditatedly ‘ lied
under oath. ‘ ' 1' ‘E  l N I

Most Democrats do not even dis-
pute the fact that the president lied un-
der oath in his Jan. 17 deposition in the
Paula Jones case and in his grand jury
testimony seven months later.

Because Clinton’s self-proclairned
“misleading” testimony revolves
around the topic of sex, many are prone
to dismiss the act of lying all together.
They claim that every American would
lie about improper sexual relations if
placed in the same position.

Perhaps, but laws against commit-
ting perjury exist to prevent lying under

All existing ODK members can be
on the committee if they choose. With
the help of Howison, they look over
the list of candidates, and a majority
vote chooses the lucky few. Howison
said that, although a simple majority
vote could be close, it never is. Dis-
cussion about potential members is
usually going on long before the vote
is taken.

The result this year was clear-cut:
10 out of the 19 undergraduate induct-
ees are dorm counselors or resident
assistants (who are, incidentally, cho-
sen for those positions by committees
that include existing dorm counselors
and resident assistants). In fact, 14 out

of the 46 current D.C.s
, _ and R.A.s are mem-
0 VCS lfl bers of ODK.

 That isn’t so

-._j;- 5"" Prosser strange, you might
" Erica prosser 99 say. Donn counselors

are, after all, campus
leaders by definition,
and ODK is a leadership honor soci-
ety. Besides, that leaves nine people
who aren’t dorm counselors who were
still initiated this year.

It’s who DIDN’T get in that puzzles
me. For example, although the society
claims to include leaders in campus
publications, not one person initiated
this year or last was a leader in any
campus publication. Given the num-
ber of hours that editors of campus
papers, magazines and journals put in
every term, their leadership cannot be
questioned. But they still didn’t make
the cut. And there are other people
who seem deserving who didn’t get
the honor.

I wonder how people like Erin
Kraal, Amy Frazier and Cliff Woolley
can possibly be excluded. Kraal (as-
sistant head resident assistant this
year), while taking a break from run-

oath about any topic, including sex.
These laws have serious consequences
for any American citizen who chooses
to ignore them, including the president.

Bill Clinton has not only mocked his
responsibility as a citizen to tell the truth,
but he has also violated the public trust.
The American people elected Clinton
in the faith that he would protect the
Constitution on which our democracy
was founded.

Instead, by attempting to undermine
the legal process, Clinton has only suc-
ceeded in undermining the very trust
that defines his relationship with his
constituents. He has treated the law as
a mere stepping stone on his way to
maintaining his own power and pres-
tige. These facts constitute high crimes
and misdemeanors, and are worthy of
impeachment.

Most Democrats would like to see
Clinton censured and move on their
merry way. The censure tenns proposed
by the Democrats on the Judiciary Com-
mittee state that the president “made
false statements concerning his repre-
hensible conduct” and “wrongly took
steps to delay discovery of the tru .”

The censure proposal itself, which
is favored by the White House, only
serves to back up the perjury and ob-
struction of justice claims made by the
so-called evil Republicans.

What good will a hefty fine and pub-
lic reprimand do to alter the damage that
Clinton has already done to the nation
and its people. If we ignore abuse of the
legal system now, will that not leave the
door open for future leaders to do the
same?

Yes, impeachment is a constitutional
crisis of grand proportions and it will
have some harsh ramifications for our
society. These consequences, however,
will in no way outweigh the damage that
will be done if Clinton is simply slapped
on the wrist.

We attend a university in which
honor and integrity“are“ revered and’ irr

‘ which lying and'cheatin?g"“ar€“c’6risiii5 ‘

ered to be evils worthy of expulsion. If
we value the ideals of Washington and

Lee in our personal lives, then should

we not also consider them to be equally

important in the life of our nation’s high-

est leader?

The Clinton trial is not simply about
sex and cigars, but about standards
of truth and justice and upholding
these American traditions — these
W&L traditions. Our president has
failed in his duty to defend our Con-
stitution. Can we really afford to do
the same?

ODK overlooks qualiﬁed students

ning her hall, took the time to form
WITS, an outreach program that in-
volves area girls in science. Frazier
was the editor of The Trident, and
being in charge of any campus pub-
lication takes literally hundreds of
hours of work each year. Somehow
she also ﬁnds the time to lead Out-
ing Club activities. Woolley seems
to be ready to lend a hand with any-
thing, be it running the Computing
HelpDesk, working on projects in
the theater department or keeping
the equipment working in the j-
school. And these are just a few of
the unsung heroes who probably de-
serve to be sung about more often
for all they do around here.

Maybe their grades aren’t high
enough for the strict ODK cutoff,
you say. Well, then, I have to ques-
tion why ODK puts so much em-
phasis on grades when there are
countless other national societies to
honor academic achievement. But
we can’t change the way ODK does
things, you say. Fine. Then maybe
we should start a new society, one
that actually focuses on leadership,
not academics. And maybe we
should find a more impartial way of
inducting members.

Sure, ODK is a great honor, and
probably all those inducted de-
served it. But I just can’t help but
think that some people are falling
through the cracks. If they just
aren’t well-known enough to exist-
ing members, or if their grades just
aren’t high enough, they get passed
over. A word to the wise: keep an
eye out. There are other campus
leaders who deserve much of the
credit for making this place run, and
although they didn’t get ODK, they
get all of my support and admira-
tion.

Meal of the week

by Sex Machine and Fire & Ice

#8: Two all beef Baja Gorditas, one soft taco,
some fire sauce, and a refeshing Dr. Pepper

 

new Baja Gordita this week. I know you’ve always been a
big fan of the Supreme, but I think the Baja might be a
worthy contender.

Sex Machine: Ice, baby, the ﬂy flavor of the new Baja
certainly launched my taste buds into orbit. Our mistake,
my ﬁery friend, was ordering the all beef. That zippy Baja
tang needs to join the juices of some tender steak.

F &I: S&M man, you’re so right on one point. The beef
did leave a bit to be desired, something the Sex Machine
never allows, but I’m going to have to say that the new all
white chicken would have been a tastier choice.

S. M : Whatever you like. At least we agree that the Baja
is a worthy counterpart to the Supreme. I’m not saying
that the Baja should take the place of the Supreme. They
each have their place.

F&I: Another thing I’d like to say about the Bell is that
those are some efﬁcient workers. I stood stupiﬁed as I
watched the chef do his Mexican magic. I want to meet the
culinary genius who figured out that a caulking gun could
be used for easy application of sour cream.

S.M.: Well, I have one word for you, “Spankings.”

F&I: That’s “Spanky’s.” I’ll see you later in the week
when we get together to get a little Rowdy.

Q

». Most of us grew up in a world al-
ready dealing with the AIDS epidemic.
We were bombarded by ad campaigns,
signs and speakers that told us what
HIV-positive meant, how the virus
could be spread and what we could
do to be careful. Soon, the little red
loops of ribbon on people’ s lapels were
an everyday sight, one we barely no-
ticed anymore. Unfortunately, now
that AIDS has been around for almost
20 years, some of us may be getting
rusty on our AIDS knowledge.

3. I can get HIV by French kissing.

4. If someone infected with HIV is in my class at
school, I am more likely to get it.

Hooking-up with death

A PHI

STAFF EDITORIAL

It’s easy to assume that we at
Washington and Lee are immune to
the AIDS epidemic. Hell, these kids
are from rich families. Look how they
dress. This isn?t the HIV crowd.

Get real. In no way is this a cam-
pus that likes to abstain — from
much of anything —- especially sex.
Our culture of binge drinking en-
courages it.

And through the haze of beer
goggles, condoms are probably not
the highest priority.

There are no reported cases of
HIV or AIDS on campus, but one
person could start an epidemic. That
one person might have HIV already,
and not even realize it.

Because it can take years to die
from AIDS-related complications, we
might not see a current W&L stu-
dent succumb to karposi sarcoma,
wasting disease or AIDS-related
pneumonia — but many people
could be dead by our ﬁve and ten
year reunions if we aren’t careful.

Don’t be blinded by another
student’s good looks or popularity.
You don’t know their sexual pasts.

Remember, the next time you
hook-up, an embarrassing glance
from your one-night partner on the
Colonnade may be the least of your
concerns.

If you feel you might be at risk,
go to the inﬁrmary immediately.

Lowden comes up big 

Freshman Berry Lowden scores in the ﬁnal seconds of
Saturday’s game to give the women’s team a narrow win.

By Tod Williams

SPORTS WRITER

On Saturday against Guilford, the Generals proved they
were asecond-half ball club in dramatic fashion. With only
28 seconds left in Saturday’s game, freshman guard Berry
Lowden made the lay-up that would end the Generals’ 10-
game, ﬁve-year losing streak against ODAC foe Guilford.
The basket, which came from Lowden’s rebound after her
own previous miss, put the Generals up 63-61 for good,
snapping the Quakers’ four-game winning streak.

“I drove the baseline,” Lowden said of the last—minute
action, “and after 1 put the first shot up, the rebound just
kind of fell right back down to me, and it seemed like I was
the only one around. Everything was in é C

Kudlacik shot 7-for-1 1 from the ﬂoor, including 3-for-5 from
behind the arch.

Kudlacik said the team had talked in the days prior to the
game, and went into the game more focused on playing
together. Yet she saw the Generals soon slipping into their
old ways. “We knew we weren’t playing well at the end of
the first half,” Kudlacik said. “At halftime Coach [Terri Dadio
Campbell] corrected the X’s and O’s and everything, but
then we talked as a team. We knew we could win, so wejust
went out there and played like it. Right now, we’re ready to
start accomplishing what we know we can do.”

Senior forward Chrissy Burghardt led the Generals in
rebounds with 10. Beacham lead the Quakers with 18, and
both Arden Miller Landenberg and Kerrie Campbell of
Guilford each added 12 points.

Thursday’ s game against

slow motion. It was such an adrenaline
rush.”

but the Generals were able to cut a little
from the lead, and went into the locker
room down only 14 point, 42-28. _
When the Generals came back from the break, they raced
out on an 1 1-4 run, only to have the Quakers answer with
an 8-2 run to build the Quaker lead to 13 at 54-41 with only
9:47 left in the game. At that point, the Generals decided to
take control of the game. In the next five and a half min-
utes, W&L went on a 22-7 run. With 4:11 left, freshman
lison Kudlacik nailed her third three-pointer of the day,
knotting the score at 58-58.
Guilford’ s Erin Beacham hit her own three-pointer with
3 :56 remaining, but the Quakers would not see the bottom
of the net again. Kudlacik hit two from the charity stripe,
and freshman Jessica Mentz added another to tie the game
at 61-61, setting the stage for Lowden’s heroics. Mentz
had 16 on the day, while Kudlacik scored a game-high,
career-high 21 points, 15 of which came in the second half.

ahead 30-19, and the second half
would echo those numbers. The Generals shot 44% in
the game, only one percent less than Bridgewater, and
W&L actually won the rebound game by five boards, 3 1-
26. But turnovers tell the real story of the game. The
Generals turned the ball over 27 times in their loss to
Bridgewater, compared to only 18 times in the win over
Guilford.

Ansley Miller led W&L with 17 points, and Burghardt
notched her sixth double—double of the season with 10
points and 11 boards, seven of which came on the Eagles’
end of the court. Amanda and Angela Osborn led
Bridgewater with 18 and 17 points, respectively.

On Tuesday, the Generals hope to continue their win-
ning ways as they host Virginia Wesleyan at 7 pm. in the
Warner Center.

Wrestling holds own at home

The Washington and Lee University wrestling team
placed sixth of eight teams in_ the W&L Invitational on
Saturday afternoon in the Warner Center.

Leading the way individually for the Generals was jun-
ior Chad Casto, who was the runner-up in the 133-pound
bracket. After a first round bye, Casto defeated Davidson's
Dan Carman 13-5 in the second round before losing to
Scranton's John Cavey in the ﬁnals, 5-1.

Sophomore Jeff Paul also produced a second place fm—
ish, his coming in the 197-pound bracket. Paul began by
defeating Judah Keenan of Pensacola Christian, 10-3, then
pinning Doug Norris of Longwood in just 29 seconds. In
the finals, Tony Booth of Washington and Jefferson
emerged victorious, downing Paul, 10-5.

Freshman Ezra Morse took home third place in the
174-pound bracket for the Generals. Morse defeated
Davidson's Jeff Bender 12-0 in the first round before
suffering an 8-3 defeat to Longwood's Kamel Chantal in
the second round. Morse then advanced ahead of sopho-
more teammate John Valentine by default and then de-
feated Davidson's Justin Perkinson 3-2 in the consola-
tion round to earn the third place finish.

ors and Scranton's Mike Grandchamp was named Out-
standing Wrestler of the Tournament. W&L will be in

Hoehl shines in face of defeat

By Steele Cooper

SPORTS WRITER

The Washington and Lee men’s and women’s swim
teams both dropped disappointing losses to Johns Hopkins
and Sewanee on Friday and Saturday. The men fell to JHU

48. Hopkins defeated the women with a 103-42 score, as did
Sewanee with a106.-38 score. X K,  . , .
The bright spot for the Generals this weekend was a
tremendous performance by senior captain Margaret Hoehl.
In three events Hoehl won three first place ﬁnishes, two
NCAA provisional qualifying times, and a new school

that event from Sewanee. ,3
Hoehl also won the 200 Free with a time of 1.57.83, and‘?
the 1650 Free with atime of 1753.1 1. Her finish in the 1650‘:-

Men down, but not outgrsé

By Brendan Harrington

SPORTS WRITER

For the Washington and Lee men’s
basketball team, 1999 has been any-
thing but a happy new year.

The Generals (3-12, 2-7) lost their
eighth straight game Wednesday night
at Emory and Henry, falling to the
Wasps 92-57 to remain winless in 1999.
The Generals last victory came on Dec.
9, when they defeated the same E&H
team 80-70 in Lexington.

“Having beaten E&H the way we
did in the last game, it was very disap-
pointing to lose,” Coach Kevin Moore
said. “It was the same exact team.”

The Wasps (9-5, 6-2) took the lead
7-6 early on in the game and never
looked back. E&H led at the half 3 8-24
and used a 7-0 run to start the second
half and break the game wide open.
The Wasps outscored the Generals
54-33 in the second half.

E&H shot a solid 53% from the ﬁeld
and was 6-1 1 from behind the three-
point arc. The Wasps scored 30 points
off 24 W&L turnovers and out—re-
bounded the Generals 42-29.

“We got beat in every phase of the

  

  

      

game,” Moore said. “Defensively!?1‘
that’ s the worst we’ve played all year.‘
They were doing whatever theyg;
wanted and we couldn’t stop them.’?;‘§

Sophomore guard Bryan Pruetfg
scored a game-high 24 points for tlférf
Wasps. Senior forward Donalﬁ
Thurston scored 18 and his twig;
brother Ronald added 13. 

For W&L, senior Kevin Cobbin 
10 points and sophomore WillBa11a1‘.gE§.
had eight. The Generals shot 22—2§t,§
(79%) from the free throw line but shqjs
only 34% from the ﬁeld and 1-10 ﬁoiﬁgﬁ

three-point land. .;-1,.
Things don’t get any easier fort 
Generals as they travel to ﬁrst-plac;:'¥
Hampden Sydney on Wednesday. 
Tigers were undefeated and rankegi;
ﬁrst in the nation until they lost to“
Randolph-Macon 68-57 on their home
ﬂoor this past week. 
Moore was quick to point out that
W&L played that same Randolph-Ma-
con team tough last Saturday in Lex-
ington, a game they lost by five points.
“We have nothing to lose,” Moore

said. “We have nine games to play and A

we want to be in the ODAC touma-
ment. We are not about to pack it in."-v

God revises the Ten Commandments ’

by Kevin McManemin

DUCKING THE LIGHTNING Bow

Does it bother anyone else that no
new books have been added to the
Bible in several centuries? Back in
the old days people couldn't wipe
their noses without God adding an-
other book telling them how to live,
but now the man upstairs seems con-
tent to just sit back and let the faith-
ful have their fun misinterpreting
vague 2,400 year-old passages.
Well, I think it's time for God to get
01?" his cosmic ass, dust oﬂ his pen and
give us some clear rules on how to
live in this frantic modern age, clear
up the moral ambiguities and take
some stands on modern ethical dilem-
mas.
Wait a minute, I ’m feeling divine
inspiration kicking in right now . . .

The Book of Tito

Chapter 24

And Lo, it soon came the twenty-
ﬁfth day of the first month in the sev-
enth year in the second realm of King
Clinton the Elder of Washing Town.

The prophet of the Lord, her name
being Jenn and Jenn being her name,
did ascend upon a mountain high in
the Catskills on a nature hike, and
there seeist she a burning bush.

“I am the Lord,” sayest the bush.

“Lord, are you aware you’re on
fire?” replied Jenn.

“Of course I’m aware! Now I shalt
give thou ten commandments, ten . . .
what the hell are you doing?”

“Stamping you out. That bush is
an endangered species.”

“Never mind the bush. I am the
Lord thy God, who created all the
bushes and trees and birds of the air.”

“All the more reason you should
respect wildlife. Shame on you!”

“Shame on. . . I AM THE LORD!
Thou shalt not disrespect me. I see all
and know all.”

“I’m so sure. Where’s the hidden
speaker? Am I on one of those hidden
camera shows?”

“I have chosen you to be my mes-
senger, Jenn, to spread my new com-
mandments throughout my ﬂock. For
centuries people have been misinter-
preting my Word. It is time I cleared a
few things up.”

“All right, I’ll play along. What
channel is this going to be on? Hold
on, let me put on some makeup. I look
so totally gross right now.”

“Forget the makeup. I give thee . . .
THE WORD OF GOD!”

Thus at the spaking of the Lord,
the rocks didst shake and the ground
didst split apart. Two stone tablets
emerged from the ground, and the ﬁre
of the Lord did burn words on the tab-
lets. .

“Cool pyrotechnics,” Jenn said.

“Go now,” sayest the Lord. “Take
mine commandments to my people.”

“On stone tablets? Yeah, right.
Why don’t you just post it on the
web?”

“The web?”

“Sure. Just buy yourself a computer
with a modem. I got a Powerbook a
few months ago. Got it on sale from
Office Max. Half off!”

“Really? Half off?”

The Lord didst go to Ofﬁce Max
the next day, but the sale being a
President’s Day Sale eight months ago,
the sale had ended, and the Lord be-
ing too late for the sale decided
against paying full price, and didst in-
stead buy a cheaper model with com-
parative RAl\/Ibut only a 28.8 modem.

Thus the next day the Lord did log
on and design his new website,
(www.heaven.org) which boasted
MIDIs of “How Great Thou Art” and
“Amazing Grace” and ahilarious “pin-
the-Jesus-on-the-cross” Java appelet.
There was even a section where people
could send e-prayers to the Lord. The
Lord got it on all the major web direc-
tories and even got a website review

LAST WORD

 

JANUARY 25, 1999

in PC World magazine, and the web
traffic was great, and the Lord was
pleased.

And on his page the Lord didst
post the following message:

My people, I give these Ten Com-
mandments to you that you may live
in My Light.

Follow them thusly and you shall
eat naught but milk and honey and
Snapple. Disobey mine orders and
thou shalt be smited.

I) I am the Lord thou God, thou
shalt worship no other God but me.
This also applies to trendy Eastern
religions that have that “not-really-a-
God-but-an-interconnectedness-of-
all-nature” crap. In fact anything in-
volving yoga is right out. I’m running
a religion here, not a friggin’ calisthen-
ics class.

II) Thou shalt not make false idols.
Sports stars, actors and rock stars
shalt thou not worship, for these idols
are mostly alcoholics and drug ad-
dicts. Thou shalt build no shrines to
the Spice Girls.

III) Thou shalt not use the name
of the Lord in vain; at least not be-
tween the hours of 7-9 p.m. on net-
work television.

IV) Honor thy father and mother.
Not just your biological father and
mother, if you know who they are, but
your father and mother’s new
spouses/life partners as well. Honor
also the grandmother or aunt who -
actually raised you. Honor your day
care provider or, if your folks were
wealthy enough, yourlillegal immi-
grant nanny who looked after you
during your formative years.

V) Thou shalt not kill, unless thou
can afford great lawyers.

VI) Thou shalt obey the marriage
covenant. Well, obviously there are
exceptions depending upon your deﬁ-
nition of “sex.” For example, oral sex
is not really sex, but even if it is, a
woman who pleasures a man is break-
ing the marriage covenant but he is

not. Hast thou got it? Lying is also bad,
except for lying under oath about sex,
which is understandable.

VII) Thou shalt not steal. When
thou writest a song, thou shalt write
thy own melodies and lyrics and not
“sample” them from other sources.

VIII) Thou shalt not covet thy
neighbor’s wife. Thy neighbor’s six-
teen-year-old daughter shalt thou
covet in the stead. Thy neighbor’s wife
hast seen better years; thy neighbor’s
wife’s bosoms doth sag low. Besides,
thy neighbor’s sixteen-year-old

Don’t get soaked by Adam
Sandler’s “The Waterboy”

by Brian Prisco
PHI MOVIE GUY

 

(WAIT UNTIL TBS PLAYS IT
FOUR DAYS IN A ROW)

What’s that I hear? Someone run-
ning around like a jackass and making
ridiculous cro-magnon sounds while
affecting some sort of irritating accent?
Could it be? YES! It is! Another Adam
Sandler movie.

Adam Sandler, or “OH SHIT NOT
AGAIN” as many other movie critics
refer to him, is in fact a funny, funny
man. I know when I am going to see
one of his movies, I can basically check
my brain in at the door and enjoy the
slapstick immature retard humor (no
offense to retards, you probably have
more social skeeels than Sandler).

I have laughed and laughed at ev-
ery single movie he has made, includ-

daughter is probably more sexually ex-
perienced.

IX) Keep holy the Sabbath day. Hey,
how come’ no one ever sacriﬁces goats
to me anymore? I rather liked that ges-
ture. Let’s bring it back.

X) The powers not delegated to the
United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are re-
served to the States respectively, or to
the people.

And thus the people of the Lord
did read the message and misinter-
preted Commandments 2-6 as procla-

ing this one. “Billy Madison,” “Happy
Gilmore” and “The Wedding Singer”
are some of the funniest movies ever
made. I can sit and watch them over
and over again. This movie, though, I
could only watch over and over again
if someone strapped me into one of
those torture chairs from “Clockwork
Orange” and held my eyes open with
hooks.

If you saw the preview, you basi-
cally saw just about every funny mo-
ment in the movie. Basic plot: idjit gets
mocked, idj it gets pissed, idj it cripples
college students with bone crunching
hits, idjit becomes a hero. Okay, so I
wasn’t expecting some psychological
thriller. I just wanted to see the big
mongoloid smash into people.

It happens, but not nearly enough
to keep me entertained. This movie is
really not worth the price of the ticket.
At least in his other movies, Sandler
kept the tempo up and kept the action
fresh. This movie’s humor gets stale
by the first half-hour.

I like Adam Sandler. I have all three

mations against homosexuals, Com-F‘
mandments 7-9 as a “green light” to
abortion doctor murders and Com-
mandment 10 as a sign that the anti-
Christ is Christopher Reeve. _
And thus the Lord sighed a heavy
sigh and hurled the Earth into the sun.
The sun being unpleasantly hot, the
people did perish, except for the Cana-

dians where the temperature was now ~,,

livable.

Thus the Canadians became rulers
of the earth and peace and politeness
returned to the world.

ofhis albums. I have seen all his mov-
ies. He is funny. After “The Wedding
Singer,” I didn’t know which direction

he was going to go. Apparently, nei- 

ther did he. This movie is really just
sub-par in comparison with his other
work. Was it funny‘? Okay, I admit it
made me laugh, but my time would have

been better spent watching his early ,,

stuff.

The major problem here is that he
chose an awful lead character. Bobby
Boucher is based on “The Excited

Southerner” from his comedy I‘

sketches. I don’t know how y’all feel,
but “The Excited Southerner” is suh-
suh-suh-stupid. I don’t mean that in
the nice Ralph Wiggum with a ﬂute
stuck up his nose stupid, but in the
boring, odd, disturbing sort of stupid.
LikeMADTV.

I guess I’m just asking for a movie
about his character “The Goat.” Who
wouldn’t love a talking goat that
swears like an enraged sailor and
sounds like an illegal immigrant? NOW
THAT’SCOMEDY!
