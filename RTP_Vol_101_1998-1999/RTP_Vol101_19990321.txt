W &L Law
‘ranked #20

“W&L drops one spot in US. News
and World Rep0rt’s Law School ratings

‘i By Polly Doig

NEWS EDITOR

Just in time for undergraduate se-
giiiors who are struggling to make a
decision about which law school to
choose, US. News & World Report
has released its graduate school
rankings.

This year, the Washington and
Lee University School of Law was
ranked 20th out of the 181 accred-
ited law schools surveyed, a drop

‘of one place over last year.

“I’m pleased that we’re ranked as
highly as we are,” Dean ofthe Law
School Barry Sullivan said, “but
there are some problems with the

‘rankings and one should not take
them too seriously.”

For undergraduate students,
however, the slight drop may be too
little, too late to mean anything.

“These don’t come out in time for
us to look at recent rankings when
we’re applying,” senior Hillary
Coombs, who has been accepted at

Kthe W&L School of Law, said. “It
seems that US News is trying to
persuade some people’sjudgement
by releasing this information at the
time when people are making deci-

Vsions as to what school they want
to go to.”

Third year W&L law student
Steve Gosney says that the slight

rop is relatively insignificant.

“It seems to me that it’s really
more a matter ofthe fact that we’re
in the top tier,” Gosney said. “I think
it’s probably pretty accurate as far

‘as placing us there.”

Coombs says that though she
factored last year’s rankings into her
decision as to what schools to ap-

‘ply to, the new rankings will likely

have little impact on her ﬁnal deci-
sion of what school to attend.
“I don’t know where I’m going to
school,” Coombs said. “I’mjust kind
ﬁof skeptical of the overall ranking
procedure; it tends to make people
a little superﬁcial, make them won-
der about injuring their earning po-
/ tential.”

‘"3 “I think they do have a signiﬁ-

cant impact for some people,”
Gosney said. “But I feel that the
Princeton Reviewrdoes a much bet-

«terjob of ranking than U.S. News.

It’s a dangerous thing just to pick a
school based on rankings. It’s re-
ally more important to visit the
schools."

Many law schools themselves
object to the ranking system used
by U.S. News, claiming that the meth-
odology, which considers criteria
such as reputation, student selec-
tivity, placement success and fac-
ulty resources, is insufﬁcient.

According to Harrison Rainie of
U.S. News & World Report, 169 law
school deans endorsed a letter that
was sent out to all law school appli-
cants this year encouraging them
not to give the rankings undue im-
portance. Sullivan was one of the
deans who signed.

“The rankings are only one of a
variety of resources available to help
students make an informed deci-
sion,” Sullivan said. “I’m not sure
that there’s any better scale, but I’m
not sure that this is a good one.”

Among problems that Sullivan
cites are the lack of division between
national and regional law schools,
and the inaccuracy of certain num-
bers.

“One thing we get a low score on
is that about 60 percent of our stu-
dents are employed at graduation,
while 97 percent are employed nine
months out,” Sullivan said. “This is
based on self-reporting, and there-
fore ﬁuctuates because of differing
methodologies. The poll attributes
substantial weight to reputation, so
that puts us at a disadvantage be-
cause ofour small number of alumni
in comparison to other schools.”

For both Sullivan and Coombs,
however, the small size of W&L is
one ofits largely ignored attributes.

“I haven’t heard from a couple of
schools, but ofthe schools I’ve got-
ten into, W&L is my first choice,”
Coombs said. “I have a class there
this term, and I’ve felt very comfort-
able with the way students interact
with their professors. And that
makes me very comfortable with the
idea of continuing my education at
W&L.”

Gosney agrees, maintaining that
the law school maintains a high de-
gree of excellency in spite of it’s
small size.

“I’ve found that the quality of
students and professors here is re-
ally high,” Gosney said. “There’s
nobody here that shouldn’t be
here.”

Other Virginia law schools in-
cluded among the top 50 were the
University ofVirginia (7th) and the
College of William & Mary (32nd).

Generals crush Diplomats

Men’s lacrosse outplays opponents and stays at #3 in NCAA Division III

By Brendan Harrington
SPORTS WRITER

The Washington and Lee men’s
lacrosse team improved their record
to 4-0 against teams from Pennsyl-
vania after they destroyed Franklin
& Marshall 18-2 on Saturday after-
noon at Wilson Field.

“From the very first whistle, we
jumped all over them,” W&L head
coachrlim Stagnitta said. “F&M is
not a bad team, but we didn’t give
them even a chance to win that
game.”

The Generals (4-1) scored three
goals in the ﬁrst 1:32 seconds ofthe
game and never looked back.
Sophomore attackman Matt Dugan
had five goals and two assists as
seven different Generals found the
back of the net. Sophomore

midfielder Pope Hackney had four
goals and two assists, junior
attackman Chris Brown tallied three
goals and two assists and junior
attackman Colin Dougherty added
two goals and two assists.

Sophomore Wes Hays andjunior
Dan Grattan combined to make eight
saves in goal for the Generals. The
Generals dominated the Diplomats
(2-3) in almost every statistical cat-
egory, outshooting F&M 51-13 and
winning 18 ofthe 22 faceoffs.

The Generals, who are ranked
third in the latest STX /USILA Divi-
sion III National Poll, have outscored
opponents from the Keystone State a
combined 74-12. The Generals’ only
loss was a one—goal defeat at the hands
of Washington College, the defend-
ing national champions and ﬁrst—
ranked team in Division III.

“This is an extremely talented
group of kids and it’s amazing how
hard they have worked,” Stagnitta
said. “And we’rejust going to con-
tinue to improve because we’re so
young.”

Many people believe that W&L
has the tools to not only win the
ODAC, but maybe even make a run
at the National Championship.
Stagnitta says the team’s first and
foremost goal is to win the ODAC,
but he adds that this year’s team has
tremendous potential.

“As long as the kids maintain
this level of excitement and inten-
sity, they can go as far as they want,”
Stagnitta said.

The Generals crushed Dickinson
24-2 on Wednesday afternoon at Wil-
son Field. The game was tied 1-1
with 10:00 left in the first quarter

before the Generals scored 13
straight goals to take a 13-1 lead
midway through the second quarter.
Dugan had four goals and three as-
sists to lead the Generals while
Brown tallied ﬁve goals and one as-
sist. Dickinson fell to 1-3 with the
loss.

The Generals begin conference
play on Wednesday afternoon when
they take on twelfth-ranked
Lynchburg.

The Hornets are 5-0 and sur-
prised everyone when they upset
eighth-ranked Ohio Wesleyan ear-
lier this season, who defeated W&L
in the quarterfinals of last year’s
NCAA tournament.

“We will not be caught offguard,
we know Lynchburg is a good team,”
Stagnitta said. “They have a lot of
seniors and an excellent goalie.”

Gleeful Harvard visits Lex

By Polly Doig

NEWS EDITOR

Lee Chapel will reverberate with the
sounds of America’s oldest all-male
college chorus, the Harvard Glee Club.
on Wed., March 31.

A sub-group of the Glee Club,
Harvard Lite, is also scheduled to sing
with Southern Comfort Thursday night
at the Ruse.

“We’re going to try for around 10
pm. because some of the guys in the
group have another concert at 8 p.m.,”
Chris Edwards, of Southern Comfort,
said. “But the guys at the Ruse gave us
the okay to go ahead with it.”

Though arrangements aren’t com-
plete yet, Edwards says plans should
be ﬁnalized soon.

‘‘I’m excited,” Edwards said. “I think
it’ll be a great opportunity for us to get
to sing with a bunch of talented guys
that we wouldn’t normally sing with.”

The Glee Club was founded in 1858,
and was initially a social club at Harvard,
performing college songs and “glees.”
Since then, they have perfomied with
the L.A. Philharmonic and the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, as well as in the
Vatican.

The group will stop in Lexington as
part of its 79th spring tour. They have
previously toured throughout North
America, Europe and Australia since
1921, when they became the first Ameri-
can college chorus to travel to Europe.
The Glee Club consists of more than
50 members and is expected to perform
music ranging from the Renaissance to
contemporary composers.
The concert is being sponsored
jointly by the Emily Edmondson Penick
Pearse Memorial Concert Series and the

R. E. Lee Memorial Episcopal Church.
The Glee Club will inaugurate the Pearse
Memorial Concert Series, a bequest from
the late Mrs. Pearse, who was a Lexing-
ton native, longtime hostess of Lee
Chapel, and lifelong organist and pa-
rishioner of R. E. Lee Church.

In lieu of tickets, a free-will offering
will be collected during the concert, in
order to promote future concerts in the
Pearse series. Suggested donations are
$5 for adults, and $3 for children and
students.

A truly frightening insight
into my inner monologue

Sometimes I think that I wasn’t
meant for life as a human being. I’m
not alone in this thought, for my fam-
ily and friends tell me the same thing
all the time. In fact, perfect strangers
(one of my favorite shows from the
’80s, I must say) quickly pick up on
my blatant misunderstanding of the
human way of life. Don’t ask me to tell
you just what it is that I don’t under-
stand because I don’t have the foggi-
est. I do think, however, that I could
easily grapple with some other form
oflife.

Growing up in Catholic school, we
used to have this
little song that
went something
like, “lfl were abird
in the sky, I’d thank
you Lord that I
could ﬂy . . .” et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera, “but I just
thank you Father for making me me.”
Sometimes my mind didn’t quite get
to that last line. I’d sit there in music
class thinking, “Golly, I really wish I
were a ﬁsh in the sea. How cool would
that be?”

Well, I guess that fateful day in
Mr. Louie’s music class set the
course for my inner monologue for
well over the next decade ofmy life.
Constant dreams of“Golly, I really
wish I were a cow on the farm. How
cool would that be?” dash though
my mind. Over the years I’ve come
up with many alternative life forms
that I think would suit me.

I’d like to share some ofthem with
you. Maybe you can get a kick out of
the fact that your mind isn’t as dis-
tinctively skewed as it obviously
could be. Or perhaps you can relate
to the desire to step out ofthe human
realm into the more exciting Animal
Kingdom.

Ranking number one on my list
would have to be “a bear in the

..r’”iOff His Rocker

 Stephen Pesoe ’O1

woods.” The top selling point of the
bear is hibernation. I hate winter. I hate
snow. I hate cold weather. I love to
sleep. Hibernation would totally elimi-
nate the most miserable season ofthe
year, replacing it with glorious sleep.
Furthermore, I’m a big fan of the
simple bare necessities and forgetting
about my worries and my strife. I
wanna be like you, Baloo.

“A ﬂy on the wall” is a close sec-
ond. All right, so ﬂies only have a two-
day life span. But that’s one of the
only downfalls. First ofall, as the name
indicates, you can freakin’ ﬂy. How
cool would that be?
On top of that, your
onlyjob in that two-
day life span is to
ﬁnd a mate, and that
can be one of your
dozens of sisters.
Not very honorable, but certainly not
very stressful. Hey, ifI’m lucky I can
ﬁnd a bowl of soup in a restaurant. I
like soup. And to whoever’s soup I
ﬁnd, “Sure, it may be disgusting. But
hey, free soup!”

Tying for second, “a bird in the
sky” would be up there on my choices.
Like the ﬂy, you can ﬂy. The life span
is a bit longer and you have a pretty
voice, but the stress factor goes up
incredibly. You have to worry about
b—b guns and Alka-Seltzer. There is,
though, more opportunity to branch
out from the family as far as getting a
mate. But then again, there’s more re-
sponsibility when that family does
come. Those kids are going to need
worms and ﬂight lessons. In any case,
bird is right up there with the coolest
oflife forms.

Flesh—eating bacterium! Well, that
goes without saying.

“A shark in the sea” would also be
right up there. The first thing I would
do ifl were a shark would be to go to
Candice Bergen’s house, knock on

the door, and when she asks, “Are
you that pesky shark again?” I’d say,
“No ma’am, I’m just a dolphin, just a
friendly dolphin.” Then when she let
me in, I’d bite her head off. Sharks can
also have a good time screwing up a
little kid’s ﬁrst trips to the beach. I guess
that is something that the juvenile sharks
do. Eventually, I’d mature and stop do-
ing that.

Two words: Mon Key! (That’s
French for monkey.)

“IfI were a gator in the swamp,” I
probably wouldn’t have that recurring
nightmare that I am eaten by a mas-
sive alligator. And ifl did, I would be
the gator instead of the frightened
little boy who wakes up in a cold
sweat. I’d be the big reptile that wakes
up hungry and hunts down small chil-
dren who’ve lost their way. Oh, the
vengance is ﬁnally mine.

Another creature I often want to
be is that mysterious insect that crawls
around my bathroom. What the hell is

that? I’m telling you, these things"

have mutated and evolved from some
other form of insect into this very spe-
ciﬁc species that only lives in my bath-
room. It looks like a cross between a
scorpion and a doodle bug. I refuse
to kill any of them because I think that
one day they may advance the causes
of science, or aid in the study of the
effects of uncleanliness. In any case,
that’s what I want to be. At least then
I’d have the serenity of knowing.

I don’t care what anyone says
about that old mushroomjoke, the one
where the boy mushroom can’t un-
derstand why the girl mushroom
won’t go out with him. He say’s “Why
not, I’m a Fungi.” That’s funny. I’d
like to be “a mushroom on the lawn,”
so I could use that one.

“A duck on the pond” could be
fun. Not a swan, too showy. Not a
goose, too mean. But a duck, yeah
that’s right, a duck.

Summer scholar
bereaves potential
lose of Night Owl

Dear Phi,

This past summer, I was a par-
ticipant in the W&L Summer
Scholars program during the
month of July. In walking around
town, I discovered the music store
Night Owl. I ended up visiting the
store several times throughout the
month, and I bought a couple of
CDs there. Now, I’m sorry to read
that Wayne Raynal, owner of the
store, might have to close his busi-
ness due to competition with
Crossroads.

Let me just say that I urge you 7
to take your business to Wayne.
Like he said, everything he sells
is a buck cheaper than the other .
guy. Not only that, but Wayne is
also a great guy ~—- he can tell you
just about anything you would
want to know about any band, and
he’ll open up a CD and play it for
you in the store if you want to
hear it. I enjoyed doing business
with Night Owl this past summer,
and I hope I will be able to con-
tinue to do so when I start school
at W&L in the fall.

Sincerely,

Phi editor offends

Dear Editor:

I am writing this letter in regard
to a section of “The Last Word"
by Kevin McManemin in
Monday’s The Ring-tum Phi.
This section of an otherwise-hu-
morous piece on special-interest
publications, “The Daily Indepen-

dent,” was just plain mean-spirited.

As zffemale independent, the things
McManemin describes don’t really
apply to me, but I still felt personally
ﬁislufedpy what he said. Just because
a guy i§i1’t a member of a fratemity——
for whatever reason — that is no rea-
son to classify him as a reject without
a social life. That is an intensely self-
important and intolerant outlook.

This is the reason why people are
critical of the Greek system in general.
Attitudes such as this which inﬂuence
the “us-versus-them” mentality really
don’t do a lot to change the stereo-
types of the intensive, rich, white-boy
frat culture that is hostile to anyone
that isn’t one of them.

I know that’s usually not the case

and that for the most part Greek guys ,

arejust as nice as non-Greek guys. But

“cases like this just reinforce those same

images that I’m sure the greek commu-
nity would like to do away with. I would
ask that in the ﬁltLIl‘C McManemin give
some real thought to what he writes;
he’s not just reﬂecting on himself, but
on the entire Greek community. Thank
you.

Monday March l5th’s issue was no

However, as my eyes wandered
down to the “Gross Incompetence”
newsletter, I immediately thought of
the slew of letters to the editor in a
newspaper a while back, after a stu-
dent had written a “well, I thought it
was funny” article about the security
staff. Like the security staff, the B&G
staff works hard every day, many of
them at odd hours. Yes, I have heard

T rident’s McManus abandons '
humorous for offensive

In Wednesday’s edition of The Tri-
dent, Sean McManus, in a pitiful at-

- side of the story, I’ve done my job. There

.* was no such attempt on McManus’s

tempt to revive The Trident’s anemic-rl part. Calling someone a “lavender

back page, blatantly and needlessly‘
insulted a student’s personal life, and’

thus ruined the reputation of his pub-
lication.

First, regardless 
ofwhat McManus’s A 
views are on classes
being cancelled,
there was no need to
mention the Executive Committee or
this particular student. Not only was
it an insult, but it also was a deliberate
attempt to barb someone by using the
power of the press.

I cannot condemn this without be-
ing a hypocrite, but when I go after
someone, I try to make it for the right
reasons. Perhaps I’m being a little too
presumptuous, but I’d like to think that
if I can make one person see another

Second, why does he care so much
about this student’s
personal life? You
can think whatever
you what about this
issue, but for God’s
sake, don’t be judg-
mental. Don’t like it? Don’t l,:’>‘emli‘is

is no need to put him down in this
manner.

God forbid someone on this cam-
pus ﬁt into any other mold except the
khaki-wearing, apathetic, egotistical,
drunken brat who pretends that he
never studies.

Finally, the ultimate responsibility
for this ridiculous excuse forjoumal-

ism lies with The Trident. McManus
is merely another renegade columnist
and can be controlled. Why did the
editors allow such ﬁlth to ﬁnd its way
onto the page’?

A ' They’re W&L students, so I as-

,°sume they have some semblance of

I intelligence. Anyone with halfa brain
could ﬁgure out that McManus’s last
paragraph should never have seen the
light of day. The only reasonable ex-
cuse is to get attention for the publi-
cation, not caring what kind. Though
this might be understandable, it is in
no way excusable.

Therefore, I propose a challenge.
McManus should apologize to the of-
fended student, and The Trident
should print a retraction. Doing so
would not only preserve personal and
journalistic integrity, but help keep
alive the traditions ofhonor and civil-
ity here at W&L.

STAFF EDITORIAL

Putting together a newspaper every week in a small
town like Lexington on a small campus like Washing-
ton and Lee often presents a problem. On most cam-
puses, something can happen one day and students
may not know about it the next day. That’s where a
newspaper’s role comes into play. When students
know everyone on campus and everything that goes
on around campus, a newspaper runs into problems.

When the student body knows everything before
the newspaper does, it is forced to run things like the
men’s lacrosse game and a visiting glee club on the
front page. (Not that there is anything wrong with
men’s lacrosse, everyone loves lacrosse.) One edi-
tor expresses anger that time spent with the Phi has
contributed to her complete lack of contact with the
opposite sex over the past year. The rest ofthe Phi

staff concurs.

In any case, The Ring—tum Phi and The Trident
certainly try like the dickens to put out interesting
little rags, but sometimes there isjust not enough new,
fresh, excjting information to captivate the readers

vattention. the Phi truly tries and tries to do and do
and do for you kids, so ifwe fall a bit short on some
(or most) occasions, please forgive us. We're not

-"getting any’for Christ’s sake.

Destination: Spring Break 1999

Students have options for planning and executing great vacations away from Lex over April break

By Erica Prosser and Elianna
Matziani
F EA TURES EDITOR AND STAFF WRITER

Look around you. The weather is slowly but
surely warming up, the days are getting longer,
and you only have two (count ‘em, two) weeks
of classes left.

Though it might be difficult to see even two
weeks into the future, rest assured that, at the
other end ofﬁnals week, you will ﬁnd a week of
freedom.

Yes, spring break is just around the comer,
and many students are already salivating for it.

“It’s important to leave town because every-
one needs a break and a change of scenery,”
senior J.R. Leitch said.

So what are you doing for that much-antici-
pated week?

Some students, like freshman Ken Jackman,
will head home over spring break.

“I am going to go car shopping, interviewing
for a job, and go see ‘Phantom of the Opera,”’
he said. “Then I am going to Washington to
visit my girlfriend for a few days.”

Freshman Mandy Cannon, too, plans to re-
turn to her hometown for a week of relaxation.

“I’m going home [to Cincinnati],” she said.
“I’m going to rest.”

Some students will forgo the homeward trek
in favor of trips to domestic vacation spots.

“I’m ﬂying to Florida,” Leitch said. “I’m go-
ing to spend the week in a beach house.”

Still other students, like many members of the
Washington and Lee Chorus, will be traveling
to exotic locations abroad. The chorus will be
visiting Costa Rica.

“I think it is going to be a lot of fun,” said
freshman chorus member Veronica Grifﬁth.
“We’re going to be doing some sight-seeing.
We’re going to a volcano and a hot spring and
the beach, so it should be nice.”

What if you don’t have any set plans yet for
break, but you want to make some? What if you
suddenly decide to spend that week on the beach
instead of in your house? Worry not, intrepid
travelers; there are ways to make last-minute
vacation plans that won’t put too big a-strain on
your budget.

One of the best places to plan a vacation is
on the lntemet. The ‘net is full of discounted

airline tickets, cheap hotel rooms and travel pack-
ages for students. Don’t know where to start?
Keep reading as we plan an imaginary trip to Ft.
Lauderdale over April break.

A good place to start looking for airline tick-
ets is on the home pages of major airlines. US
Air, for example, ﬂies out ofRoanoke, the clos-
est airport to Lexington. The US Air home page
is located at www.usair.com, and it includes meth-
ods for booking hotels and rental cars in addi-
tion to airline tickets. But for now, let us just
consider this site for the airfare.

Under “Book a Flight” and “Check Fares,”
you can ﬂll out a form that asks you when you
are ﬂying, where you are going, what time of the
day you want to ﬂy and what class you prefer.
The site then gives you a list of potential ﬂights
each way, and you can pick from them to as-
semble your itinerary. A ﬂight from Roanoke to
Ft. Lauderdale on April 10 (and a return ﬂight on
April 17) costs about $634 round trip through
the US Air web site.

That price too steep? There are other ways
to find airfare -online. Discount airfare outlets
also operate_ through the Internet, and these of-
ten investigate several different airlines in order
to give you the lowest price, including potential
student rates. One such site is www.airfare.com.
The ﬂight from Roanoke to Ft. Lauderdale and
back that cost $634 on U S Air cost only $222
through this site, but at this late date, all of the
most discounted rates were sold out.

A few words of advice for airfare in general:
to get the best fares, book as early as possible,
usually no later than two weeks before you ﬂy.
Also, many ofthe discount sites will assemble
great ticket rates, but they sometimes involve
changing airlines mid-trip, so you must decide if
the slightly increased hassle is worth it. Flying
on a weekday is sometimes cheaper than ﬂying
on weekends, so if you can put off your trip
until Monday, you might save.

Changing the time ofday that you’re willing
to ﬂy can also help the price or availability of
seats, and ﬂying from a more major airport (such
as Washington’s Dulles) can often mean cheaper
rates and direct ﬂights (the April I0-April 17 trip
to Ft. Lauderdale, for example, cost a student
rate ofonly $174 from Dulles, and at press time,
there were still seats available through
www.airfare.com).

Antique Market in London over February break.

What about hotels? Most major hotel chains
have interactive web sites, too, and many fea-
ture special promotions and cheaper rates
through the Internet. To check into Holiday Inn
rates anywhere in the world, for example, visit
wwwl.basshotels.com/holiday-inn and take a
look around. There are last minute discounted
rates, spring promotional rates and standard res-
ervations to choose from.

Back to our trip to Ft. Lauderdale. When you
enter “Fort Lauderdale” on the Holiday Inn web
site, the result is a nice list ofhotel choices, each
with amenities listed. Rates for the area hotels
range from about $80 per night (single occupancy)
to more than $140 per night (single occupancy),
but many of the hotels offer a “rate change” (dis-
counted rates) during some nights of the stay.
Double occupancy may or may not affect the
nightly rate; it varies by hotel.

Of course, discount hotel services abound
online. One great site is www.placestostay.com/
index.html, which gives you rates for many nice
resorts in a given area. It specifies the ones
that are especially discounted, as well. For Ft.
Lauderdale, this site returned vacation houses,

suites and bed-and-breakfasts that were com-
parable in price to the Holiday Inn hotel room
rates.

If you prefer to travel using vacation pack-
ages, those can be found, too. At www.
discounttravelwizard.com/, for example, pack-
ages to dozens of exotic destinations can be as-
sembled for often comparatively low prices. An-
other great feature of this site? Special informa-
tion links, such as the currency converter, glo-
bal weather and State Department travel wam-
ings. lust page down to see these helpful sites.
To find other package sites, run a search for
“travel packages” on a search engine.

Still a little shaky on travel, especially to some-
place unknown? Research never helps. Most of
the popular travel destinations, major cities and
geographic areas have tourism web sites that
you can explore (just run a search for your place
of choice).

April break is fast approaching, so whatever
plans you have yet to make, make them now.
Above all, ﬁnd a relaxing destination and get
away from the stress for a while.

You deserve it.

The Washington and Lee women’s lacrosse team suf-
fered a decisive loss to Randolph Macon at home for the
first time in the team’s history on Saturday afternoon.

The Yellow Jackets built two-goal leads on three sepa-
rate occasions early in the game, but the Generals were
able to ﬁght back and cut the lead to 6-5 withjust over

23 minutes remaining. Despite their efforts, W&L al-

Things went better for the Generals on Thursday in
Lynchburg, as sophomore attack Liz Borges scored with
4:06 remaining to edge out the win 6-5.

Freshman Eloise Priest and sophomore Christine van
den Toom opened scoring to give the Generals an early
lead. A free position goal by Lynchburg’s Laurie Ward cut
the lead to 2-1, but freshman Courtenay Fisher put a free
position shot of her own into the back of the net. W&L’s 3-
1 lead stood at the end of the low-scoring half.

The Generals managed to score another free-position
goal at the beginning of the second
half before the Hornets went on a

game and hand the Generals the 10-

“You have to give credit where
credit is due, and they deserve the
credit,” Head Coach Jan Hathom said.
“They were very organized, and they
executed well. We were just outplayed
on a number of occasions. lt’s
disapointing, especially when the loss
is not from lack of trying. We were
doing everything we could.”

test will be a tough one for the Generals, as Middlebury

Hathom, however, is optimistic. “We have great capa-

Boys of summer send Hokies home

By Tod Williams

SPORTS WRITER

The Generals stepped up their de-
fense on Saturday to knock off D-II
opponent West Virginia Tech in both
games of a doubleheader.

In Saturday’s first game, sopho-
more David Sigler threw a complete
game to shut out the Golden Bears 2-
0. Sigler gave up two hits, struck six
Hokies out and walked three.

With the win, Sigler upped his record
to 3-1 with an ERA of3.l3, the best on
the Generals’ staff of any pitcher with
more than three innings of work.

Senior second baseman Patrick Hall
led the Generals offensively, going
two-for-three with two singles. Five
Generals also had a hit apiece.

The Generals bats warmed up by
the second game to help the team
cruise to a 13-1 win. Senior E.J.
Murphy led W&L, going two-for-three
with an RBI. Junior Russell Wrenn and
senior Bryan Lewis each had three RBI
for the team, while Hall and sophomore
Jason May each went two-for-two.

Junior Chris Stakem came in from
centerfield to take the mound for the
Generals. Stakem struck out five
Golden Bears and walked two to go 1-
1 on the season. He allowed four hits
in his six innings ofwork. Tech com-
mitted ﬁve errors, accounting for seven
unearned runs for the Generals.

Hall said the doubleheader was a
great example of the Generals’ slow
starts this season. “It takes us a little
while to get going,” Hall said, “but if
we can stay in the game for three or
four innings, our hits will start coming.”

On Thursday, the Generals

hosted Bridgewater College. Unfor-
tunately, both teams forgot to bring
their pitchers.

After being down as much as 12-1
in the fourth and 17-5 in the sixth, the
Generals rallied in the last two innings,
scoring 10 runs. Down 20-19 in the
bottom of the ninth with the tying run
on third, freshman Matt Kozora
grounded out to end the game.

Junior Christian Batcheller led the
Generals offensively, going five-for-
six, with two home runs and three
RBIs. Hall was again an offensive
powerhouse, going three-for-six with
a home run and five RBIs.

Freshman center ﬁelder Brad Sipe
led Bridgewater, going ﬁve-for-six

with four RBIs, while senior Mike
Padgett went three-for-ﬁve with a
home run and five RBIs. Junior Todd
Campbell took the win for
Bridgewater, as he improved his
record to 2-1 on the season. Campbell
gave up nine runs on 15 hits. Six other
pitchers saw action for Bridgewater.

Hall said the Generals’ ten-run rally
was a little too late. “It showed a lot of
character that we stayed in it even
though we were getting our ass kicked.
It was disappointing, but we shouldn’t
have won it. Our pitchers just couldn’t
get anyone out.”

fell to 4-2 on the season for the Gen-
