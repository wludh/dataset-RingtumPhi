An H.V. or
not an H.V.?

That is the question. The EC
gives the answers. And you can
take them or leave them.

By Yer Momma

STAFF WHIPPING Boy

Following recent controversy, the
Executive Committee at long last ad-
dressed student concems about what
exactly might be classiﬁed an honor
violation at its last meeting.

All lies, except those listed below,
will be treated as honor violations, and
will be punished. Punishment includes
severe beatings, whippings, and vari-
ous deans opening up cans of
“whupass,” until the accused with-
draws in the face of a closed trial. Ex-
ceptions are as follows:

——PrOspectives will not be told the
truth about anything.

Other than that, students will ob-
serve the Honor System strictly so
that the university may continue to
sponsor conferences of the subject
without appearing hypocritical.

The EC also addressed the issue
Of underage drinking. The verdict: of-
ﬁcially sanctioned. The current policy
of“wink-wink, shame on you,” will be
ended. In celebration of W&L’s new
open stance, the entire student body
is invited to a raging kegger/hall crawl,
to take place between Johnny the
Prez’s house, Dave the Main-Man
Dean’s house, and Bob’s Chapel. But
don’t forget, BYOB!

——Falling asleep, while sanctioned
in a classroom setting prior to 10 a.m.,
will no longer be permitted during EC
trials. In the best interest of justice, all
representatives should be awake to
hear the evidence.

—Teletubbies, no matter what
color, are not in any way related to
snow days, and therefore may no
longer be used in arguments in favor
of, or against, said snow days. Fur-
thermore, there will be no more sin-
gling out of the lavender one, as it
makes him feel uncomfortable.

—The answer to “how’s it going?”
will now be answered truthfully. This
involves stopping and explaining the

full extent of your Crisis of the Day to
the foolish and indifferent questioner,
instead of smiling thinly and answer-
ing, “good.”

—The Dining Hall will conduct an
apple count following each meal, to
ensure that every last one was swiped.

In a completely unrelated story, but
one that we felt necessary to add be-
cause we need to fill the page, a new
W&L Handbook has been released.
It’s got a pretty blue cover, and it’s
called “Come Cheer: the Civil War at
139 years.” While it wasjust too long
for any staff member to read in its
entirety, it was required weekly read-
ing for the nerd-herd at our competi-
tion. They can tell y’all all about it
when they get done writing their lat-
est scintillating 27-word Back Page
column. But we digress into the realm
of shameless kittyfights. They
started it. And we really wish they
would really finish what they started
in 1993.

Ahem. The new handbook outlines
several curricular and conduct
changes to be put into effect immedi-
ately. Among them:

—Students will learn to speak
“American,” the official language of
the U.S. of A.

—-In addition, mandatory language
classes in “Southem” will now be listed
under section 7 of the General Educa-
tion requirements, along with C.S.A.
101 “The South will rise again,” C.S.A.
185 “Gettysburg: How that Damn Fool
Pickett wrecked things,” C.S.A. 1865/
PSYCH I865 “Coping with the end of
the War of Northern Aggression: A
nineties perspective.”

——Robert E. Lee will hence be
known as “Saint Bob.” Anything less
could be considered sacrilegious, and
prosecuted to the full extent of the EC’s
God-given power.

—Weekly pilgrimages will be made
to Traveller’s grave, with appropriate
offerings of gold, frankincense and
sugar cubes to be made.

Prez signs on for
commencement

By I.P. Freely

STAFF LIASON TO “THE M4/v "

Washington and Lee University an-
nounced yesterday that it has ﬁnally
engaged the President to speak at un-
dergraduate commencement.

Although reluctant to follow Tradi-
tion, President John Elrod agreed to
speak to this year’s graduating seniors.
According to sources who wished to
remain anonymous for fear of tickle tor-
ture, the President did not wish to speak
as he “couldn’t be bothered with the
latest bunch of

along, we snapped it up.”

Reaction among students, who had
been hearing rumors of another distin-
guished speaker, were mixed.

“I had really been looking forward to
the speech of David Duke,” seventh-
year senior Tyler T. Taylor XXIV said. “I
delayed graduating a whole other year
just so I could try out the new Kappa
pledge class, uh, so that I could listen to
the Grand Wizard himself speak. This
isn’t going to be printed, is it?”

Speculations about the content of
Elrod’s speech are running amok.
“We expect

khaki-clad twits.” him to read selec-

Elrod is re— tions of Dr. Seuss,
quired in his con- including the clas-
tract to speak and sic, ‘Oh, the Places
make nicey-nice You’ll Go,’” Shaw

promotes a higher
rate of alumni re-
union participa-
tion, and the en-
suing drunken
idiocies encour-
aged by the uni-
versity to pro-
mote check-writ-
ing sprees.

“ We just
couldn’t be happier to have a speaker
of Elrod’s caliber at graduation,” Brian
Shaw, director of communications, said.
“We intially contracted Mother Teresa,
who was to give her message of inspi-
ration through a séance, but when the
opportunity to have Elrod speak came

President John-John H. Elrod

said. “Of course,
there’s always the
possibility of de-
parting from
Seuss, and going
with something
non-traditional
like, ‘Not Without
My Daughter.”

As usual,
Elrod will con-
gratulate C-
School majors on
their wise career choices and bright fu-
tures, and shake his head sadly at Col-
lege majors and cite the high percent-
age of predecessors on welfare.

Elrod will resume his rigorous tour

W&L boys make good: New Fowl Temptress album “Empty Silos,” featuring seniors Chad Reynolds and Mac Harris, debuts #1
on WLUR/Lexington charts. Residents of the Rockbridge County Correctional Facility voted the boys “Best <expletive
deleted> of the Year.” The Temptresses will open Mock Con with a little help from their friend Willie.

Willie Nelson to open for Fowl
Temptress at Mock Con Kickoff

By John Galt

STA FF WHIPPING BOY

The most important band to come
out of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will take the stage at the Stu-
dent Activities Pavilion for the Mock
Con Kickoff on April 30 -— if they
stay together that long.

Fowl Temptress, the brainchild of
seniors Mac Harris and Chad
Reynolds, released their second al-
bum, “Empty Silos,” last week to rave
reviews of everyone at WLUR 9l .5
and WLUR listeners at the
Rockbridge County Correctional Fa-
cility.

The Student Activities Commit-
tee confirmed that Temptress will
headline the Mock Con Kickoffwith
country great Willie Nelson as the
opening act.

But despite the recent success,
the band may be falling apart. “I
would hate for Chad to know this yet,
but it’s been months since I could
even stand to be in the same room
as he is,” Harris said. “I feel like his
vision for the band has become vul-
gar and pig-headed. lt’s reached the
point where I feel I have no alterna-
tive but to take control myself, just
to preserve a kind of fundamental
integrity in our music.”

Harris says he realized Reynolds
had lost sight of the vision when
Reynolds made this statement: “Mac
and I used to be no-gooders, brig-
ands of the lowest variety, pond
scum. Hell, we still are, but now we’re
okay with it. So we’re better than all
you pretenders, and we know it.”

Reynolds claims his motivations
behind Fowl Temptress have been
the same from day one. “It ain’tjust
music,” he said. “It’s a way of life,
our way of life, where success is
measured by the number ofdai ly fail-
ures and scraping by is overachiev-
ing. It’s always been that way. It al-
ways will.”

From the beginning, Reynolds has
looked to the streets for inspiration.
“Even though sometimes I spend the
night in gutters, alone — alone, that
is ‘cept for the memories ofthe other
times I slept in other gutters,” he
said, “I always know that when I pick
up my guitar the Lord is working

through my fingers, making ‘em slide
faster and faster over the frets, to
Baptize the faithless with licks of
fire.”

Harris says he always finds more
influence through political mes-
sages. “When - A A
people ask me
about our influ-
ences I tend to
think ofMalcolm
Cowley and the
folk ballads of
the Black Hand
organization as
the two most im-
portant,” he
said. “Then I fo-
cus on a distant
Object and don’t
speak for a few
moments. This is
probably be-
cause I am so
overwhelmed by
their influence.”

After the re-
lease of their
critically ac-
claimed single,
“Fat Town,” in
I997, Harris and
Reynolds toured
the local educa-
tional circuit.
Their largest gig
to date is the 1998 Rockbridge
County High School prom. Both
Harris and Reynolds are ecstatic
about the opportunity to possibly
jam with twang legend Nelson.

“We just hope that maybe he’ll
talk to us,” Harris said.

“Yeah,” said Reynolds.

The Temptresses are forced to
limit their tour dates due to
Reynolds’ diet. “I don’t never
touch no yellow-colored potato
salad, ya know, the mustard kind,”
he said. “cause instead of coat-
ing the potatoes it lets me see right
through ‘em. Like I’m eating an ap-
parition.”

Reynolds also refuses to make his
own food. “How come I don’t cook
for myself? Hell, I ain’t got no de-
cent oven-mitts,” he said.

Despite their battles over grub
and motivation, Reynolds sees a

strong similarity between the two.
“Sure, [Mac]’sjust like me, only dif-
ferent. But the same really, only a little
different.”

Their vision may be skewed, but
at least Harris has remained

grounded. “I think I have a realistic
view ofthe importance of our mu-
sic,” he said. “I mean, I don’t think
we will be remembered any more
than someone like, say, Hank Will-
iams. Or Bach.”

The boys of Fowl Temptress entertain their rabid fans at the Yellow Brick Road
Child Care Center. “Children understand our music better than anyone else,”
lead vocalist Mac Harris (right) said. “It relates to art brut and art of the
insane. When you get down to primal, instinctual levels of understanding,
that’s when you’ve found the true meaning of our music.”

Bombing of Kosovo
doesn’t go far enough

Currently the USA is divided be-
tween those who think we must inter-
vene in Kosovo to halt a mass geno-
cide and those who think we have no
business bombing foreign countries.
Well, ifyou ask me, we’re not bomb-
ing enough foreign countries. 9

Any objective person who looks
at a world map will come to one inevi-
table conclusion: there are a lot of for-
eigners out there. Some of them, like
the English and the Canadians, are
amusing but harmless. Others are not.

Take the French. The United States
currently has a non-bombing policy
towards France. I propose that we re-
verse this policy. I propose we get a
few B-52s and drop napalm all the way
from Nonnandy to Nice. Think of the
many beneﬁts this new bombing policy
would have. For one, a lot of French

people would be dead. And that’s
good news for the world.

Of course, critics of this bombing-
France policy often point to the one
major detraction of the plan: if France
is gone, those dirty, deceitful
Deutschlanders will pretty much run

Europe. Well, there’s a ﬁnal solution
to that problem, mein friend. You
guessed it: bomb the kraut out of Ger-
many! I say this time we get the bas-
tards before they start another World
War.

And come on, let’s be honest.
Who’s going to miss the Middle East

 

if we nuked that whole stinking desert?
Answer me this: has one good thing
ever come out ofthat godless region?
OK, civilization, maybe. But that’s be-
side the point. The Middle East is noth-
ing but trouble today and I think stick-
ing it in that great microwave called
the US nuclear arsemal and cooking it
on high for the next 10,000 years will
solve all their problems nicely. Jews,
Arabs, Christians, whatever. They all
look the same after their skin and inter-
nal organs have been irradiated away.

In conclusion, the United States of
America has a responsibility to itself
and the world to use its military might
for the good of all. Where there are
tyrants, bomb them! Where there are
foreigners, nuke them! Where there are
targets, hit them! By God, can we do
any less?

Survey shows 100% of W&L
students to drink this Weekend

A recent survey conducted in
Baldwin’s room Friday afternoon con-
cluded that l00% of W&L students
plan to drink this weekend.

The results were telling: of the four
students polled, four responded that
they were “deﬁnitely going to get
drunk this weekend,” zero responded
that they “might get drunk this week-

The poll is a drastic change from a
February 27th poll that showed only
50% of W&L students were drinking
this weekend, while 25% were work-

25% were “smoking up.”

Point/Anotherpoint

Preserve Lee’s legacy

In 1865, Robert E. Lee came to Washington College
and instilled in that community a sense of honor and per-
sonal integrity. As Washington and Lee University moves
boldly into the twenty-first century, we
must never forget Lee’s heritage of
honor.

First of all, the honor system must
be preserved at all costs. The honor

So1_1ﬂE5}7G1aoe
GraoeThorn26,’99

system is Robert E. Lee’s great gift to
every student enrolled in W&L. We
have the academic freedom that other
schools only dream about. It’s a shame
that many students today don’t think
that the honor system is effective. The
EC must work hard to promote student
dialogue and reassure even the most
cynical and pessimistic among us that our system works.

Furthermore, we must preserve Lee’s legacy by keep-
ing the speaking tradition alive on campus. Too many of
us pass each other on the hill every day without so much
as a nod. Robert E. Lee knew that civility was important in
instilling a sense of community.

It was Robert E. Lee’s great hope that Washington
College would be a community of gentlemen. With his
two-pronged plan of the honor system and speaking tra-
dition, Lee hope to attain these goals and showed the
same goodjudgement and genius which manifested itself
to many victories on the battleﬁeld.

We must preserve the legacy of honor at Washington
and Lee University. We owe it to General Lee.

North. Lee must have been high when
he placed his whole war plan around
the strategic importance of Harrisburg,
PA. What a dirnwit.

Robert E. Lee couldn’t even win a
war against Ulysees S. Grant, a
bumbling alcoholic. And when the war
was over, do you think Lee really
wanted to spend his ﬁnal days in some unknown col-
lege in bumbletwat Virginia? No, he wanted a cushy
professorship at Harvard or Yale. But the respectable
schools wouldn’t touch that traitor.

The relationship between our school and Lee was
simple: we used his fame to get a little name recognition,
and he came here because we were the only place will-
ing to put up with this half-witted hick for a few years
before he thankfully kicked the bucket.

If we’re going to engage in inane hero worship, let’s
at least pick a man worthy of our admiration. Robert E.
Lee was a murderous slavery-loving traitor whose grave
it isn’t even worth my effort to spit on. F*ck Robert E.
Lee, and the horse he rode in on.

J 0minatrix’s popular traveling show is big hit with students

By Jenny Jones

FOR T HE R1NG- TUMPH1

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and

girls, the second greatest show on

Earth is coming to Lex!

Yes, you heard right, Madame
Purgatory’s S&M Show is coming to
the Pavilion on April 1. You’ll laugh,
you’lI cry, you’ ll kiss your inhibitions
goodbye as Madame Purgatory makes
it a night you won’t forget.

“I love this show,” junior Staci

Eversol said. “I see it every chance I

can. Itjust gets better every time!”
Madame Purgatory (real name: Bar-
bara Murphy, formerly ofLincoln, Ar-
kansas) and her traveling show have
been on the road for nearly 10 years

‘ now. She started the act, she said, out

ofa need for a “liberating experience”
after her husband left her for a 19-year-
old ﬁgure skater. Barbara Murphy the
iousewife was no more ~ Madame
Purgatory was born.

“I knew I needed a change, some-
thing drastic,” Madame Purgatory said
by phone from her last stop in
Poughkeepsie, New York. “I had some
leather left over from when I made my
husband a new belt for Christmas 

. ‘before I knew it, I had created Madame

Purgatory.”

This ﬁve-foot-seven, red-haired,
thirtysomething Southern belle set
about making her show business
dream come true. She recruited two
assistants from her divorcee’s support
group, bought a van and some sup-
plies, and took her show on the road.

I ‘She’s never looked back since.

“It’s wonderful,” Madame Purga-
tory said. “We do one show in each
location, then move on. Some of our
fans follow us from place to place, like
we’re the Grateful Dead or some-
thing!”

To hear the fans tell it, the show is
worth all the attention. Madame
Purgatory’s show includes herself,
two assistants and boxes full of props.

“We bring the props with us ev-
erywhere,” Madame Purgatory said.
“Sometimes, they even come in handy
in emergencies. We once towed the
van out of a showdrift with the bull
whip, and the candles come in handy
for power outages.”

The props are used most often
during the show itself, though. Audi-
ence members vie for the chance to
be one of the dozen or soivolunteers
that Madame Purgatory accepts dur-
ing the course of the performance, and
those lucky enough to be chosen go
on stage to become part of the act.

“I couldn’t believe it,” senior Brett
Farley said ofthe time he was chosen
as a volunteer during a performance
in Waukegan, Illinois. “She pulled me
up on stage, and one of the assistants
blindfolded me. I thought I’d died and
gone to heaven.”

Madame Purgatory and her assis-
tants use the volunteers to demon-
strate both classic tastes and the lat-
est trends in sadomasochism. Themes
run the gamut from tamer games such
as bondage to more exotic demonstra-
tions with whips and hot wax.

“We try to keep up with the indus-
try,” Madame Purgatory explained.
“We do a lot ofonline research to see
what’s out there, what’s popular
among the S&M set.”

They keep safety ﬁrst, though, by
instructing the audience beforehand
about the use of“safe words,” words
that let the women know when to stop
what they are doing.

“Safe words are important if you’re
going to get into things,” she said. “I
mean, ‘no’ doesn’t always mean ‘no’
when you’re caught up in it, but when

the bottom [person receiving the pro-
cedure] has had enough, he can say
‘red,’ like a red light, and the top [per-
son giving the procedure] knows that
it’s too much.”

Does “yellow” mean warning,
then?

“Absolutely,” Madame Purgatory
said. “‘Yellow’ means ‘watch out,
we’re getting close to the point where
I say “red.’” And people can have
other safe words, too, like ‘horse’ or
‘diamond’ or something like that.
Something unrelated to the role-play-

Madame Purgatory herself dresses
the part of the dominatrix for the show,
complete with stiletto-heeled boots
and leather accessories. She emcees
the performance with the aid of a head-
set microphone, like the one Garth
Brooks wears.

“It’s very freeing,” she said ofthe
microphone. “It keeps my hands free
for more important things.”

Disco lights and themed music
complete the effect ofthe show. Ma-
dame Purgatory said that the music is
usually soft, to offset the louder
sounds on stage.

“I spend a lot oftime yelling dur-
ing the show,” she said. “The music
keeps me on track, keeps me from get-
ting too into the show. Otherwise, you
never know what might happen.”

She sees the show as a sort of
therapy, getting her over her past and
on to better things.

“It’s such a release,” she said of
her new life. “I never knew that being
powerful could be so much fun. lt’s
addictive.”

Of course, Madame Purgatory does
have her opponents. Protesters some-
times picket outside the locations
where she performs, but the picketers
don’t bother her.

Madame Purgatory poses with one of her volunteers during a
recent show. Her traveling show has made her famous, and
students can’t wait to participate when she comes to Lex.

“I pity them,” she said. “They have
such small minds.”

Many people who were once op-
ponents find they support Madame
Purgatory once they experience her
show.

‘‘I was wrong to think she was evil,”
Father O’Connelly of Green River,
Maine, said. “Her show is fabulous!”

Madame Purgatory’s S&M Show

will begin at 8 p.m. on April I. Stu-
dents can get tickets in front of the
Co-Op or from the scalper at the door.

Tickets cost $8 for the four-hour
show. Students wishing to be volun-
teers may want to arrive early and get
good spots near the stage.

“I‘m gonna be there at least three
hours early,” freshman Eric Vogt said.
“I can’t wait to be part ofthe act!”

Rugby scrums up
unlikely victory

By Austin Tod Powers

MAN or MYSTERY

Washington and Lee Team Strike
Force ﬁnished 3-for-4 on the first day
of the 61st annual General Lee Rugby
Tournament. Junior Ben Smith led
Team Strike Force with eight rugs as
the team won its first game 46-32.
Freshman Tom Lee and sophomore
George Wiley scored four times apiece
for Team Strike Force. The team held
the University of Virginia to a .146
rugging percentage on the day.

Team Strike Force lost its second
game to the Quakers of Eastern Men-
nonite. The crowd of 19,000 had to be
restrained by the considerable secu-
rity force when senior Mike Watson
was called for an illegal rug with only
six ticks left on the clock. The Quak-
ers then broke the 49-49 tie with their
free rug. Jeff Jones led Eastern Men-
nonite with 18 rugs, his season high.

Team Strike Force won its final two
games, a doublerugger, against James
Madison University Presidents. Wiley
led Team Strike Force with 13 rugs in
the first game, which was ended by
the 20-rug rule. Sophomore Jay
Richardson led the Team in the sec-
ond game with l 1 rugs. Bonnett again
was stellar in goal for Team Strike
Force. He limited the Presidents to
only 14 rugs in both games.

Co-Captain Watson was rather
pissed following the game in which he
was called for an illegal rug. “I was
really pissed,” he said, “that I was
called for an illegal rug.” Watson said
once the call was made and the game
was over. “Well, I did cuss that bas-
tard ref out,” Watson said.

Coach Lilly Houston said she was
“proud of all my sexy boys.” After

the game, she said she hoped to get‘

“all my little men insanely drunk and
high, then make three hardcore porn

videos.” Coach Houston is in her 26th
year coaching Team Strike Force.

The real story on the day came dur-
ing the team’s first game against the
Presidents. With only 46 seconds left
in the ﬁfth quarter, a monkey dressed
in a French Maid outﬁt ran across
centerfield. After a drunken Alpha
Sigma Sigma yelled loudly to point out
the monkey to the many spectators.
Not long after the ASS’s antics, a 400-
pound cycloptic woman began chas-
ing the monkey. One anonymous fan
said, “She kept yelling ‘Giddy-up.’
That’s all I heard her say. Well, that,
and she mumbled something about
The Trident Back Page."

Team Strike Force (22-8, 1 1-3 SEC)
will host the Rockbridge County
Rugby Club on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
“We’re gonna be kickin’ asses and
takin’ names,” Coach Houston said.
Then she grabbed my ass.

(HE-THOUGH or I T)

This past Wednesday, two mem-
bers of the Generals baseball team
scored what may have been and
ever will be their most unlikely vic-
tory. Unbeknownst to anyone at
Washington and Lee, or in college
sports for that matter, seniors E.J.
Murphy and Bryan Lewis are in-
credibly graceful when submerged
in water.

Tuesday, the Generals baseball
team traveled to Ohio State Univer-
sity thinking that they would be
taking on the Buckeyes in a
Wednesday double header (hey —
there’s an April Fool’s joke right
there). In what W&L head coach
Jeff Stickley could only attribute to
“an [athletic department] office mix
up or a cruel, cruel joke played on
us by some big shot ODAC official
guy,” the Generals found that
Wednesday’s game would not be
one of the baseball variety.

The baseball team was registered
to be the first competitors from W&L
in a NCAA Division I synchronized
swimming championship. But, when
the confusion was made apparent by
the obvious differences in appear-
ances in the teams at the OSU meet,
the Generals were given the opportu-
nity to respectfully withdraw.

Stickley, however, declined the of-
fer. “When given the opportunity to
compete for an NCAA championship
in any sport, you take what you can
get,” he said.

The question then arose as to who
would represent W&L in the pair’s duo
performance, the first and most cru-
cial event of the competition. For many
of the teammates, there was no ques-

tion that E.J. Murphy and Bryan Lewis
would lead the team to victory.

“When it came time to decide,” said
sophomore Bill Christ, “Ijust couldn’t
think of two guys that would look bet-
ter swimming around together wear-
ing bathing suits covered in sequins
than E.J. and Bryan.”

So_with the cheers of the team and
some whispered words of encourage-
ment and a poolside slap on the rear
from junior Chris Stakem, Murphy and
Lewis took to the water.

Their performance was incredible,
winning them the NCAA champion-
ship and sending the favored Lady
Buckeyes home with a disappointing
second. “I didn’t even think those two
would be able to swim much less pull

off some of the unspeakable things they
did in the water together without
drowning,” said one anonymous judge.

After the meet, Lewis and Murphy

had little to say and offered no answers ~

to speculations that they would be
making an appearance at the Olympic
trials. As for the rest of the team in the
group performance, the results were
not as favorable. The program quickly

fell apart when junior Christian .

Batcheller received a swift kick in the
nose from the expertly pointed toe of
Lewis during the opening sequence.
