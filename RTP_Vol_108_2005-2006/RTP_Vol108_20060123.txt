Changing a tire
Because Triple AAA won’t
always be around to help
you out, here’s a fast and
furious guide that will get
you back on the road.

Know where your tire is:
And that pesky tire iron
too. If you can’t find your A -
spare knowing how to put
it on won’t help much.

Don’t go rolling away:
Make sure the parking
break is on and put a rock
behind another wheel as
an extra precaution.

Jack up the car:

Most cars have a spot
where the jack is designed
to go. If your car doesn’t,
make sure the jack is se-
curely placed underneath
the body of the car and
not a fender.

Undo the lugnuts:
Those are the ﬁve or six
nuts holding your tire on.
Your tire iron should fit
around each one. Turn to
the left to loosen them.
Make sure you don’t lose
these; you’ll need them
later.

Switch the tires:

Now you’re ready to pull
off the old tire; slide the
new tire onto the axel in
the old one’s place. Save
the old tire. A garage may
be able to patch it up,
which will be much
cheaper than buying a new
one.

Replace the lugnuts:

Now use the tire iron to
screw the lugnuts back on, 5
securing the spare tire to
the axel. Make sure the
lugnuts are tight to your

tire doesn’t ﬂy off ten

miles down the road.

Go get a new tire:

Your spare isn’t designed
to work forever. Go to a
garage as soon as possible
and either get your old tire
repaired or pick up a new
one.

 

 

Assault rate above average  

Though data shows problems, Washington Hall believes progress is being made

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

One year after student health
surveys exposed that Washington
and Lee has a sexual battery and
attempted rape rate nearly twice
the national average, the admin-
istration and student health cen-
ter released updated survey data
that reveals a declining number
of rapes and attempted rapes.

However, 6% of W&L
women surveyed in 2005 re-
ported that they were victims of
an attempted rape. While this
percentage is down from the
8.5% reported in 2004, it is still
much higher than the 4% of stu-
dents nation-wide who have been
victims of attempted rapes. On
an equally alarming note, 21%
of women surveyed reported ex-
periencing sexual battery, a rate
similar to the 2004 rate and
nearly twice the nationally re-
ported average. This year, only
1% of W&L women reported ac-
tually being raped, a sharp drop
from last year’s statistics’ and a
figure that is approximately half
of the national average.

Shortly after Winter Break,
Acting-President Harlan
Beckley, Dean of Students Dawn
Watkins, Vice President _of Com-
munications Tim Kolly, and Di-
rector of Student Health Services
Dr. Jane Horton sat down with
editors from the Phi and Trident
to review and discuss these sta-
tistics as well as other data re-
garding sexual assault and alco-

_ hol use at W&L.

Several times during the
meeting and in a press release,
Dean Watkins emphasized that
“one rape, one assault, is too
much.” Mr. Kolly added that the
school “still has a long ways to
go,” but said the administration
“finds the trends [of fewer as-
saults] encouraging.”

The 2004 results were gath-
ered withthe National College
Health Assessment (NCHA),
while the most recent results
come from the CORE Alcohol

, and Drug Survey. All responses

both years were voluntary and
anonymous. Because Dr. Horton
believes “that a majority of inci-
dents are alcohol related,” the
survey also contains extensive
questions about the drinking be-
haviors of students. Mr. Kolly
added that, “National fraternity
survey results say 90% of sexual
assaults involve either alcohol or
drugs.”

The data on alcohol use con-
tains several positive trends,
though in most areas the univer-

sity remains far above national
averages. Washington and Lee
students reported blacking out,
suffering injuries, and doing
things they’ve regretted later
more often than their peers na-
tion—wide.

Dr. Horton also shared fresh
data on drinking patterns that
was gathered from the
Alcohol.edu surveys completed
by all freshmen during summer
and again during fall term.
Nearly three out of every four
students reported playing drink-
ing games, chugging beers, and
taking shots, while more than
half admitted to drinking before
going out.

According to Dr. Horton, this
data “suggests that this is the en-
vironment being set up by our
current system. This is fall term
freshman year,” she added. “It’s
a very high risk time for fresh-
men.”

In contrast to the other three
administrators present, Acting-
President Beckley remained
quiet for most of the meeting.
When asked why he had come,
he replied that he wanted to be
present “because [the adminis-
tration] wants students to know
that we all think this is an impor-

 

tant issue on our campus.”
Perhaps the most encouraging
information to emerge from this
year‘s survey is the sharply drop-
ping drunk driving rate.
Whereas almost half of all W&L
students reported driving under

the inﬂuence in 1999, only a
quarter of students in 2005 re-
ported doing the same thing.
Drunk driving is one of the only
survey categories where W&L
students rank below the national
average; the administration cred-
its W&L’s Traveller service for
this drop.

“Traveller has been beefed up
significantly in the last five
years,” Dean Watkins said, “and
it’s been overhauled in the last
two years. It’s more reliable and

 
 

consistent now, while student
involvement continues to be
strong.” _

Dean Watkins and Dr. Horton
also met with the Inter-fratemity
Council and Pan-Hellenic to dis-
cuss the survey data and explore
solutions that could further lower
incidences of sexual assault and
risky drinking behavior. The
dean of students said that “both
groups were quick to respond
last year” when the initial survey
data was released. She pointed
to the new Gender Relations
Council as an example of the
Greek governing organization’s
initiatives.

Another active participant in
the battle against sexual assault
is Project Horizon, a community-
wide organization that educates
people about sexual assault and
provides support to victims. Sa-
rah Beth Campbell, a senior who
is active with the group, said that
despite the heightened focus on
the issue, “nothing really seems
to have changed.”

“Awareness is higher this
year,” she said, attributing
progress in that area to the work
SPEAK, a women’s group
founded by Dr. Jen Sayre, a
member of the University Coun-

almost half of W&L students surveyed
admitted to driving under the influence

seling department. SPEAK talks
with freshmen girls to educate
them on the risks of sexual as-
sault at W&L.

Nonetheless, Campbell feels
that W&L’s culture still has a
way to go.

“Some of the culture is a re-
sult of the alcohol; it lowers
everyone’s inhibitions, making
guys less aware of what they’re
doing and leaving girls more vul-
nerable. A lot of the inappropri-
ate touching goes on in these
parties in frat basements.”

Still, Campbell said that alco-
hol was not solely to blame.
“Part of the problem is our hook-
up culture; lots of guys and girls
go out with the intention of hook-
ing up. The physical aspect of
relationships is emphasized
here.”

Campbell offered some final
thoughts on the issue of sexual
battery, saying that she worries
“some people don’t consider it
to be an important issue.”

Nevertheless, she felt that
change is possible on this cam-
pus. “I believe people here are
good, decent people. No one
would do this sort of inappropri-
ate touching when they were so-
ber.”

Why Dr. Cornel West matters

Nationally known Princeton University professor and activist speaks at W&L

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

Who is Dr. Comel West? A
religion professor at Princeton?
A movie star? A rapper? An
activist? Perhaps he’s all of
those things. West is scheduled
to speak on campus Monday
night, and the ﬂiers tacked up ev-
erywhere say his topic will be
“Why Democracy Matters.”
West’s most recent book caries
the same title.

West has been called “the pre-
eminent African—American intel-
lectual of our generation.” That
compliment was delivered by
Henry Louis Gates, Jr., chairman
of the Afro-American studies
program at Harvard.

West has certainly spent time

at plenty of preeminent institu-
tions, receiving an undergradu-
ate degree in Near Eastern Lan-
guages and Literature after
spending just three years at
Harvard. He later received a
Ph.D. from Princeton. West has
taught in three Ivy League
schools — Harvard, Princeton,
and Yale’s Divinity School - as
well teaching at the University of
Paris during the spring of 1987.
While at Yale he was ar-
rested during protests against
apartheid South Africa, and when
the school canceled his leave for
the spring of 1987 he commuted
between Yale and Paris, teach-
ing two classes at the former in-
stitution and three at the latter.
In 1988 West headed for
Princeton, where he worked with

noted author Toni Morrison to
improve the school’s African-
American studies program; West
served as the program’s director
from 1988 to 1994. West pub-
lished a best selling collection of
essays in 1993 entitled Race
Matters.

After teaching at Harvard for
several years, West became em-
broiled in a spat with then-re-
cently appointed President
Lawrence Summers, who caused
controversy of his own last year
by arguing that there are “issues
of intrinsic aptitude” separating
men and women. At the time
Summers accused West of fail-
ing to focus enough attention on
academic pursuits. West re-
turned Princeton the following
year and currently teaches in the

religion department.
Part of Summers’s stated frus-
tration was West’s extracurricu-

lar pursuits, which include a rap
album titled “Sketches of My
Culture.” West also appeared as
Councilor West in volumes two
and three of the Matrix trilogy.
He also served as an advisor to
Rev. Al Sharpton during the 2004
Presidential campaign. West
served as a leader for the Mil-
lion Man March in 1995 and also
has participated in several sum-
rrrits on gang violence.

Another West critic is Leon
Wieseltier, literary editor of The
New Republic. Wieseltier has at
various times accused West of
opportunism, crass showman-
ship, and a lack of scholarly se-
riousness.

In reality, Comel West does a
little bit of everything, but some
of his colleagues have finally
come up with a definition for
him. ,

“Cornel is foremost a philoso-
pher,” said the University of
Maryland’s Ronald Walters dur-
ing and interview with CNN.
“He has one of the quickest
minds among scholars I know
and puts together unique per-
spectives on issues.”

BEHIND
BARS

Here’s to laughing at the
expense of those who
learned their lessons this
weekend. News Editor
Jacob Geiger took a peek
at this week's police reports
to see what you’ve been up
to during Rush Week and
especially Tear Night.

Don ’t worry, we only used

your initials.

Lawless lawyers

Usually law students sit in
court as a counsel to the
accused. Now it looks like
the counsel will need
counsel. CD, a second
year law student from
Newark, Delaware, ran
afoul of the police at 2 AM
on Saturday the 14'“. After
determining that CD was
drunk, the officers went

ahead and issued a citation
for public drunkenness. At
press time the Phi had not
heard whether the offender
would hire a classmate or
decide to represent himself.

Guess who's back

back again?

Behind Bars is pleased
(well, not really) to
announce the first repeat
offender to appear in this
space. EB, who was
stopped while running
down Nelson St. at 4 AM
one night this fall, was
arrested for a second time
during Tear Night
festivities. EB was sent
home under the escort of
fellow pledge DM, and all
seemed well until EB face-
planted thirty feet away
from two police officers.
The officers sauntered over
and arrested both
gentlemen, despite DM’s
protestations that he was

“only trying to walk his

friend home.” After a
breathalyzer test the
officers decided that both
gentlemen would need to
visit the station, and tear
night was officially over
for these freshmen, who
now face counts of public
drunkenness and underage
posession.

Please obey all

posted signs

Lexington’s maze of one
way streets can be
confusing, but Behind Bars
hadalways assumed that
most juniors had the streets
ﬁgured out by now.
Apparently not. Junior
MC was arrested at 10 AM
on Thursday the 12"‘ for
driving the wrong way on a
one way street. At least she
wasn’t speeding while
doing so. W&L really does
run this town, MC, but
obeying traffic signs is still
required.

Just focus on the lines
On Saturday January 7"‘
sophomore MN got so
wrapped up in not swerving
that she forgot to turn on her
headlights. So it goes to
ﬁgure that even if she was
driving straight and police
officer would notice her.
And one did. And then he
arrested her not only for
driving with no headlights
but also for a DUI. Behind
Bars isn’t even going to

. make a joke here. 25% of
W&L students drive drunk.
That’s just stupid, and this is
supposed to be a school for
smart kids.

Don’t drink and shoot

A ragin’ cajun by the name
of MM of Mandeville, LA
was arrested for a DIP and
carrying a concealed
weapon. Perhaps that’s
acceptable in Louisiana, but
in Virginia the police tend to
think that drinking and
shooting don’t mix.

Searching for a new leader  

Working behind the scenes, the universitys Presidential Search Committee continues to make progress

Law Professor Brian Murchison and other

members of the search committee outline their

goals and views on the hunt for a new president.

By Ashley Brightwell

REPORTER

The search for the next Presi-
dent of Washington and Lee
University has been continuing
to make progress over the last
several months. The Presidential
Search Committee, headed by
law professor Brian Murchison,
has been working diligently to
narrow a pool of approximately
150 candidates down to a single
individual who will take over the
leadership of the university.

Professor Brian Murchison of
the law school is the Chair of the
Presidential Search Committee
and has taught at W&L for 23
years. He explained that the pro-
cess is composed of several
steps. The first involved hiring
a professional consultant, Bar-
bara Taylor, to assist in the
search and forming a committee
of faculty, staff, alurrmi, trustees
and students.

This first step of the process
also included soliciting nomina-
tions from the public, which the
Committee did by placing an
advertisement of the position in
the Chronicle of Higher Educa-
tion. From September to No-
vember the group received
nominations from alumni,
former professors, and friends of
the school.

The second stage, which oc-
curred around the same time,
involved encouraging those who
would be good candidates to
apply for the position. The cur-
rent phase has involved narrow-
ing down a pool of about 150
applicants to less than 30. This
will be followed by a formal in-
terview process in February and
an announcement of the new
president shortly thereafter.

When asked about the pro-
cess of the search, Professor
Murchison said that the job “is
on schedule thanks to a very
hard working and industrious
committee. I would hope that we
know something in March or
April, but I don’t want to jinx
it,”

Professor Murchison’s opti-
mism is shared by Search Com-
mittee member Dean Hank
Dobin, who said that the search
should be over by April.

Dean Dobin, who is new to
the school this year, also had his
opinions on the qualities the new
president should possess.

Though he explained that he
has tried not to have any precon-
ceived notions, because “it
would be good for the commit-
tee to have as open a mind as
possible”, he does think that the
person should have experience
as a faculty member and be ac-
cessible to the different constitu-

encies. Dobin also said that
“though the idea of ﬁt is impor-
tant, it can be somewhat over-
rated. We want someone who
will respect this institution and
its traditions but who is willing
and able to challenge us.”

The idea of fit does seem to
be an issue in this search, espe-
cially when it comes to the val-
ues people expect from the
president. Generally, older pro-
fessors value tradition and hope
for a president who maintains
and protects traditions, while
newer professors seem more
open to change.

“The job is on
schedule thanks to
a very hard working
and industrious
committee. ”

BRIAN MURCHISON,
SEARCH COMMITTEE
CHAIRMAN
 

Professor David Dickens,
who has taught German at Wash-
ington and Lee for 45 years, be-
lieves that the president should
“improve what needs to be im-
proved, strengthen those things
that make us a good university,
and make no impetuous radical
change.”

On the other side, Professor
James Mahon, a Philosophy pro-
fessor of six years at W&L, be-
lieves that “it is actually quite
signiﬁcant if you have a presi-

dent who is liberal, and I do think
all our presidents have been lib-
eral. I genuinely believe that lib-
eral presidents are more con-
cerned with change and improve-
ment than their conservative
counterparts. A good president
will find new things to do for the
university.”

These two opinions both have
their merits and when blended
seem to show a model of presi-
dency that is best for Washing-
ton and Lee. This is only one of
the many considerations that the
Committee must make in the
search.

There is also the question of
whether we should break the
mold of 250 years of male presi-
dents and appoint a woman to the
position, and whether the next
president should be from Wash-
ington and Lee.

Though she is in favor of hav-
ing a woman as president, Dean
Dawn Watkins also made it clear
that “it’s more about the charac-
ter and quality of the person than
their gender.”

The current Acting President,
Dr. Harlan Beckley, also sup-
ports the prospect of a woman
president and believes it could
help the school to grow, though
he, like Dean Watkins, believes
that other qualities are more im-
portant. “We would be proud to
have a female president,” he

said, “and should be proud. It
would affirm that Washington
and Lee is able to welcome lead-
ership from any president who is
qualified, regardless of gender,
ethnicity or religion, and who

can become dedicated to W&L.”

Questions about the new
president’s ties to Washington
and Lee are another factor in the
decision, with some faculty
members remembering with dis-
pleasure what one called “the
Burish experience” and what
some saw as his attempts to
transform W&L into something
it wasn’t by increasing the bu-
reaucracy.

These individuals feel that
someone connected to the uni-
versity could better understand
and appreciate the things that
make it unique.

Others, such as Dr. Beckley,
are of the belief that it isn’t im-
portant that the president be con-
nected to Washington and Lee so
long as “he or she is the kind of
person who could become at-
tached to the university.”

With the end of the search
coming, students also need to
consider what they want in a
president and remain as active in
the search process. Information
is readily accessible on the
university’s webpage, and meet-
ings occur regularly that are

open to everyone. ,

Acting President Beckley was
Chair of the last Presidential
Search Comrriittee and has served
as a professor at Washington and
Lee for 32 years. He possesses a
unique perspective on the matter,
having been President and a
member of the constituency, as
well as being involved in a past
Presidential Search Committee.

Having experienced the duties
of position, Dr. Beckley brought
up some qualities that some
people might not realize that the
president needs, “an interest in

' communicating with many differ-

ent people about their concerns,
a willingness to be patient in com-
municating with the constituen-
cies, a vision of what W&L can
be, and a capacity to deal with
many issues.” ’

Dr. Beckley also commented
on what he wants from his suc-
cessor. “I want the person who
follows me to be a good presi-
dent. It is a privilege and a joy
and a significant responsibility to
be the president of Washington
and Lee. I want a person who will
take on that role and be willing
to lead us to an even better fu-
ture.”

Culture must change

Alarming statistics reveal continuing problems in gender relationships

It’s a shame that an editorial
has to be written about the preva-
lence of sexual assault in 2006,
but ignoring the problem solves
nothing.

The fact remains that al-
though we attend a prestigious
institution, which should be void
of immature and irresponsible
actions, sexual assault still oc-
curs with completely unaccept-
able regularity

While we acknowledge that
the University has begun to take
steps towards ﬁnding a solution,
we would like to address issues
that we feel are factors that cause
these transgressions and suggest
our own solutions.

Washington and Lee is known
as one of the top party schools
in the nation, and many students
boast about our drinking status.
We can still throw down with the
best of them; however, many stu-
dents use drunkeness as a justi-
ﬁcation for an assult or rape.

The use of date rape drugs, al-
cohol and other means to inhibit
one’s decision-making ability is
an inexcusable violation of an-
other person’s rights. Not only is
it against the law, it ought to be
an Honor Violation since it darn-
ages our community. No system
based on honor can long survive

when the very trust that is its base
is damaged or broken.

It’s amazing that at aschool
with less than 2,000 people that
individuals can feel comfortable
behaving this way, yet with the
strict social standards people
want to live up to, too many stu-
dents feel obliged to forgive and
forget.

There are cases when a
woman who has been sexually
assaulted has refused to turn in
her attacker because she fears
being socially ostracized not
only from the fraternity where it
occurred, but from her own
group of friends as well.

By failing to report the as-
sault, women also continue the
vicious cycle as the perpetrators
never feel as though they have
to pay for their actions.

We feel it is a problem that
there are more negative social
consequences for the victim than
for the attacker. Students are re-
sponsible for creating an envi-
ronment in which sexual assualt
is not tolerated. A rapist should
not be patted on the back or con-
gratulated, and a victim should
not be an outcast. Unfortunately
this is what happens all to fre-
quently at our school. It is time
for this mindset to change.

Suggestive actions, provocative

dancing, or revealing dress are never

excuses for rape, but if sexual assault

is going to be eliminated, women must

be ladies and men must be gentlemen.
 

Sexual assualt is a double-
edged sword; men cannot be the
only ones that are held respon-
sible to change these statistics.

While is is never acceptable
to take advantage of a woman,
regardless of how exposed she
is, women must take more re-
sponsibility for their actions
while out partying because
sometimes they may lead people
to believe that they are willing
to do more than they may actu-
ally want.

Suggestive actions,
provacative dancing, or reveal-
ing dress are never excuses for
rape, but if sexual assault if go-
ing to be eliminated, women
must be ladies and men must be
gentlemen.

Men are also not the only ones
that commit sexual assault. There

have been several reported in-
stances where men have felt as
though they have been taken ad-
vantage of sexually. Even though
they may enjoy it at the time,
these men are in no condition to
make a rational decision to par-
ticipate in these promiscuous
activities.

The problem of sexual assault
will not vanish, despite the
University’s best efforts, until
students decide to take respon-
sibility and consciously choose
to change their own actions. Fi-
nally, every student must refuse
to tolerate sexual assault.

Seifert’s painting centers around the people and activities of fishing villages. His artwork focuses on the way that a reliance on fish changes the look and feel of the culture.

W&L alum Paul Seifert opens art show from his travels as a Watson Fellow

The prestigious Watson Fellowship allowed Paul Seifert to unite his two

passions: art and ﬁshing. He traveled around the world observing and

painting fishing villages.

On his venture he turned out fine artwork,

discovered the larger world, and gained a new perspective on life.

By Nadja Wolfe
smrr warren

On Friday, January 13th, Wash-
ington and Lee alum and
Watson fellow Paul Seifert, ’04,
opened an exhibit of artwork he
created on his travels last year
at the AL-SO Gallery in Dallas.

As a Watson fellow, Seifert
was able to combine his love of
ﬁshing and of art as he traveled
to South America, Africa, Asia,
and the Middle east, studying
fishing cultures and capturing
them on paper and ﬁlm.

The col1ection’s ink draw-
ings capture what Seifert calls
the “frenzied outbreak of mo-
tion” that occurs when the
boats came in. “I would be on
the sand in the middle of the
frenzy, with ink and a reed pen,
marking down whatever bod-
ies and objects passed in front
of me,” he said.

These pieces capture the
throbbing activity of each lo-
cation, from Brazil to Malay-
sia.

Given the frenetic activity
rushing across the pages of his
pen and ink work, it is inter-
esting that Seifert gained a

new appreciation for slowing
down and sitting with his own
thoughts.

In watching the people
around him, he says, he ob-
served a lack of the hurried-
ness to which he is accus-
tomed. A

Inconveniences, such as a
six hour wait for a bus, became
opportunities to reﬂect and ob-
serve. “For me,” Seifert said,
“thinking takes time, and it is
best done on its own and not
as part of a multitask.” It is no
surprise, then, that this intro-
spection carried over to his
artwork.

The ink drawings captured

l the pace of the motion before

him as he observed the every-
day tasks of the ﬁshermen.
However, in his oil work
painted at night, Seifert dem-
onstrates a tempest of intensity
through vibrant scenes only
less active at a cursory glance.
He also uses bright color to
communicate the vibrant and
exciting lifestyle of the villag-
ers. Although they lack the
same level of physical motion
found in the -drawings, the

‘strength of thought in the

paintings has an action all its
own that enthralls and in-
trigues.

Seife1t’s travels have given
him a lot to think about as well.

He hopes through his art to
open others’ eyes to a world
much larger than it often
seems, and would be pleased
should others be inspired to
look beyond the world they
know.

, Seifert has also gained per-
spective, hinting that he sees
the world through a lens not
necessarily focused on his own
needs and actions. It is this
viewpoint that has helped him
to be “perfectly, unconsciously
content with the sitting and do-
ing nothing,” happy to be part
with and observer of every-
thing surrounding him.

This gallery exhibit is the
first for Paul Seifert, who has
hopes for future showings and
to sell his work on display .

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 5

Night of sixty-five roses

The Cystic Fibrosis Charity Ball raises money to battle the disease and provides entertainment for students

Shunning the frat scene for an evening, students

danced the night away in the classy atmosphere of

Evans to raise money for CF research.

By Nadja Wolfe
STAFF WRITER

Saturday night, W&L stu-
dents gathered in Evans Dining
Hall for an evening of dancing——
and to raise money for the Cys-
tic Fibrosis Foundation.

The CF Charity Ball
Committee’s annual fundraiser,
“A Night of Roses,” directly ben-
eﬁts research for a cure to the
illness which affects thirty thou-
sand Americans, with a thousand
new cases being diagnosed each
year.

Cystic Fibrosis is caused by
a genetic defect that inhibits lung
function and interferes with the

troubling illness. ”

digestive tract.

CF treatment has made sig-
nificant strides due to extensive
research, so that CF patients are
now living into their thirties.

The illness is also a prime fo-
cus of gene therapy research, an
area of research that shows much
promise in ﬁnding a cure.

“CF research is a very great
thing to support,” said James
Heidbreder, ’08, chair of the CF
Charity Ball Committee.

“They’re on the edge of the

cure. You get a lot more bang
for your buck—all they need is
more research.” And, thanks to
the EC’s generous funding, he
added, 100% of the evening’s
proceeds go directly to the foun-
dation.

The ball, named for a symbol

of the CFF because children with ‘

the disease often pronounce it as
“sixty five roses,” was a great
success. Burr Datz’s band,
Monrovia, and caller Becky
Mackenzie, had the room square
and contra dancing all evening.

Although new to many
people, the room was ﬁlled with
smiles as dancers learned figures
and steps such as ladies’ chain
and promenade.

Not knowing the moves was
a beneﬁt, said committee mem-
ber Dane Boston, ’08.

“When you go to a [regular]
dance... it’s things some people
are really good at, and some
people aren’t,” but since
everyone’s learning, everyone
can have fun.

The CF Charity Ball comn1it—
tee, with an active membership
of about twenty people, hopes to
fill Evans next year.

“We’d like to see more people
out here... having fun at the
dance,” said Boston.

For next year’s ball, said
Heidbreder, “we’ve been kicking
around the idea of a swing dance,
[which] might have more popu-
lar appeal.”

The comrnittee’s plans are not
only limited to the yearly ball,
however. Heidbreder also men-

tioned plans for a Valentine’s
Day fundraiser selling CFF teddy
bears for sweetheart gifts, as well
as participating in the Great
Strides Walk, CF’s version of the
Relay for Life.

Raising awareness about CF
and increasing student participa-
tion in events are also on the

agenda.
“You really feel like you’re
doing something,” said

Heidbreder, “A cure is really
close.”
And since the EC is funding

events, every dollar goes to help
the people who need it most.

“I think it’s a great evening
for a very wonderful cause,” said
Boston.

Ball attendee Debby Newell,
’08, agrees. “I came because it’s
a lot of fun and because I think
CF is a really troubling and seri-
ous illness for children,” she
said. “So it’s a win-win situa-
tion.”

Newell is right. Cystic Fibro-
sis is a serious illness that affects
many people.

And right now, as Heidbreder
says, “research is very cutting
edge,” because it is so close to a
cure.

The more students partici-
pate, the money we raise, the
closer we get to a cure.

As a university community
with many luxuries and an active
nightlife, it’s easy to forget about
causes such as the CFF.

“I would’ve come if it wasn’t
for charity,” said Newell, “but
because it’s for charity, I couldn’t
not come.”

Hopefully, more students will
adopt her positive attitude and
help raise money for CF re-
search.

Heidbreder’s committee
raised just over $1,550 for the
CF Foundation, with proceeds
from ticket sales and generous
donations. Said Heidbreder, “I
was pleasantly surprised at the
spontaneous generosity of the
University community. Strang-
ers and students alike gave gen-
erously, and we’re grateful.”

The W&L-Mart

What would W&L students and local residents dowithout this vital store?

It is a relief to know that
there is nothing that we
need that cannot be
found at the wonderful
world of Wal-Mart.

By Hugh Trout
COLUMNIST

While Lexington doesn’t have
sex appeal, a real bar scene, or
many two—way streets, it does
have one asset that is simply in-
dispensable to maintaining the
way of life we share here in
LexVegas: Wal-Mart.

Without this mega-store, nay,
ultimate—store, many of us might
have gone days without tooth-
paste, discounted fake spinner
wheels, or cheap high—powered
rifles.

While some students are hesi-
tant about patronizing a store
with questionable business prac-
tices, Lexington offers few other
options for. dorm and household
goods at a reasonable price.

When you can get every-
thing you need from a buck call
to a cartilage piercing in one
huge building, the convenience
of the store outweighs many
negatives. The efficiency of
shopping for food and mixers

simultaneously is hard to pass
up.

Wal-Mart can give you what
you didn’t even know you
needed. Here are some ex-
amples:

- a razor that has one more
blade than your current one does

— Cheap Hillary Duff posters

- Saved By the Bell DVD com-
plete collection (Time out, Kelly
is going to the prom with
Slater?!)

— discounted fake spinner
wheels for my car

— anything camouﬂage

So what doesn’t Wal-Mart
sell? For the edification of all
those who have little or no Wal-
Mart experience, I have com-
prised a short list of what cannot
be purchased at Wal-Mart.

- Pride. You cannot buy pride
from Wal-Mart if you have lost
yours. Got drunk and pissed
your top bunk bed with someone
else in it? Yeah, you can search
those aisles all day but you will
never be able to replace a loss of
pride like that.

— Chuck Norris DVDs— trust
me, I’ve tried.

- Remote controlled blimps as
seen in Sky Mall magazine

— First semester freshmen year.
Wouldn’t that be nice to do over
again?

— A sincere belief that it is them

Without this mega-store, nay, ultimate-

wheels, or cheap high-powered rifles.

and not you. Come on. . .you
know the truth. . .it was you.

— Ace of Base music videos on
DVD

- $1 blue Corona Extra san—
dals. That’s right, they’re all out
and I got on that before they sold
out. I use them as my shower
sandals to let everyone know
how rad I am.

- Direction in life. Remem-
ber how you wanted to be a ﬁre-
man or a princess when you were
younger?

At what point did I decide to
say the hell with being a profes-
sional kick ass rock star and
started worrying about the fast-
est way I could get into a cubi-
cal?

Watching Oﬂice Space is be-
coming less of pleasurable expe-
rience and more like a Ms. Cleo
vision of what my life is going
to be in three years.

The worst part of it all will
be when I’m drunk in an airport
bar and want to get angry at
someone for why I’m not giving

high ﬁves to Jack White or do-
ing Jager shots with Kelly
Clarkson the only person I can
blame will be myself because I
traded in my dream of melting
faces for crunching numbers.

If you keep compromising
yourself and giving parts of what
you want to get out of life away
to those who want you to be prac-
tical and fit into the norm one day
you’ll wake up and find out that
you are a shell of a person who
no longer has an identity, and
identities are not sold at any Wal-
Mart.

— Dunkaroos...damn, those
were good.
- A decent Super Soaker
- Starbucks... (That would be
one sweet axis of corporate evil).
So remember: while it can be
an unpredictable and demanding
world, Wal-Mart cannot provide
everything, but it will be able to
sell you all the cleaning, food,
baby, beauty, entertainment, and
hunting supplies you’ll need to
get through. S

What are you doing at Wal-Mart? Whether
or not we have moral qualms about the
store, its convenience and the lack of other
options have made us dependent.

Crystal Benevides,
freshman, says she visits
Wal-Mart at least twice a
month. “I like it, it’s not
HEB, but it’s cool.”

Amy Karwan, sophomore, says she visits Wal-Mart once
every two weeks. “You can ﬁnd everything at Wal-Mart. It’s
also perfect for mixer costume shopping. Right now, I am
buying supplies for a Zoolander mixer.”

Max Vilenchik, sophomore, says that he visits Wal-Mart
about once every two weeks. “WalMart is fine. It’s
convenient.”

 

 

Victoria Childress,
sophomore, says she visits
Wal-mart once a month.
“Not a big fan of Wal-mart’s
business practices, but it’s
so convienient and there’s
nowhere else to go.”
