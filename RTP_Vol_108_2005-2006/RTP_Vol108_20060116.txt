Feeling the rush"

socializing with members of the Kappa ‘Alpha Order last Tuesday, freshman Hobson Bryan may have found his new brothers.

Despite increasing costs, a huge time commitment and that email scandal,

Fraternities and sororities
completed another successful
rush this weekend. But at what
cost?

As the week wore on, class
attendance waned, which some
attributed to the high time com-
mitment required by Greek or-
ganizations.

Panhellenic Advisor Kristen
Powell said, “What most
women talk about negatively are
the recruitment workshops.”

“The agenda for after recruit- '

ment [will decide] what are un-
necessary frills that don’t add
genuine interaction,” Powell
said.

Powell said that the skits put
on by the women last Tuesday
may also be cut from the pro-
gram. _

“If you have to have a skit to
have somebody join your soror-
ity, you’re in a pretty bad state,”
she said, suggesting the skits be
perfomied after recruitment for
philanthropic activity.

The added cost of lunch puts
more stress on the sorority
woman’s purse.

“I think it can be expensive,”
Powell said of the rush dates,
which are not covered by soror-
ity dues which can range from
$3028 to $9115 yearly.

Freshmen women invited on
dates are also subject to the costs
of rush. According to the 2006
Panhellenic recruitment book,
“A member of a sorority may not
buy anything for a potential
member.”

Going on rush dates can add
up, “especially for the women
who are invited out once or
twice a week,” Powell said, “but
not all of the women know that
many upperclassmen.”

Does the cost of rush leave
some women out? No, accord-
ing to Powell.

“The W&L demographics
show that usually that’s not a
problem,” she said. “78% of
women [at W&L] continue to be

’ Greek.”

Not without sacrifice, as
Powell points out. For many stu-
dents, “that money is their sum-
mer job money,” she said.

Five fraternities faced a
small rush crisis Christmas
weekend, when they were sanc-
tioned by the InterFraternity
Council (IFC) for inviting fresh-
man to “consume alcohol,
sometimes in a manner of over
consumption,” according to the
IFC press release.

The organizations came un- ~

der fire when an anonymous
whistleblower left copies of
email invitations to rush events
on IFC Advisor Jason
Rodocker’s and Dean Watkins’s

desks.

Though the IFC determined
they would not cancel Christ-
mas weekend, they placed the
fraternities on social probation
for the last weekend of recruit-
ment.

According to the report, “Re-
cruitment of members into the
Greek system should not be fo-
cused around the consumption
of alcohol.”

Rodocker said, “In my opin-
ion, [alcohol-related activities
are] not the best way to make
life-long brotherhood.”

He suggested “meaningful
conversations” as an alternative,
saying that “each house should
have some idea of the values
they want,” and try to find that

  

in freshmen.

“Doing the dinners is per-
fect,” he said. “You can take the
guys out without getting them
drunk on the bus.”

Some fraternity men blame
the social obligation to include
alcohol.

Andrew Rothey, sophomore,
said, “The reality of the situa-
tion is that right now, if any of
the houses are giving away al-
cohol, they are going to have an
advantage [during rush].”

Rodocker said, “I think they
[the fraternities] have the per-
ception that there’s no other
way. I just want to make sure
they look at their possibilities.”

Rothey said, “I think it
would be difficult, in the current

Simon (left, with buddy Chris Sherwin) at a rush dinner.

 

the rush goes on

climate, to have a successful
rush without alcohol,” but
added, “It’s not necessary,”
pointing out the rush dinners as
a successful alternative. “We
have lots of rush events that are
dry.”

Rodocker said that other
schools nationwide use such
activities as “outing club trips,
road trips, and sporting events”
as rush tools, outside of parties.

For the men, whose rush-
date costs are covered by the fra-
ternity, time management is also
a problem.

Rodocker said, “The role that
Greek life should play is to be a
complement to the university.”

Rodocker said that the orga-
nizations try to “provide. . .skills
in networking, communication,
teamwork, and time manage-
ment. They can achieve [these
goals], and sometimes they do.
Our goal is to make ‘sometimes’
more frequent.”

I But often, Greek activities
take precedent over other com-
mitments, such as homework,
athletics, or other extracurricu-
lar activities.

Kyle Simon, freshman, said,
“It takes time to go to all the
houses and meet all the guys.”

Alex Skotnicki, sophomore,
said the sacrifice is worthwhile.
“It’s all worth it in the end,” he
said. “It’s all about the
endgame.”

High school rower teams up with Shinoﬁeld to revive program

By Jessica Shaw
STAFF WRITER

When W&L joined Division
III, the [school could no longer
support a rowing program. After
the sport ﬁzzled, there have been
a few unsuccessful attempts to
revive it. Recently, sophomore
Parker Sheppard, a highly
sought—after rower in high
school, decided to bring it back
to this campus.

‘‘I have put in a budget
proposal to the EC, and we

should have our hearing in the
next few weeks,” he said.
“We’ve even gotten a few boats
lined up to purchase from other
clubs.”

Service Learning
Coordinator Aubrey Shinoﬁeld
is helping Sheppard as he tries
to build up the program. If he is
successful, she said she is
considering a coaching position,
time permitting. Shinofield,
herself, was a national rowing
champion her senior year at
Princeton. After college, she

interned as a coach at Princeton
and then coached the crew teams
at University of New Hampshire,
Harvard, and the University of
Minnesota.

“Rowing is a very intense
sport, and it can be a big
commitment, especially for a
club team,” Shinoﬁeld said. “It
is a time commitment, an
individual commitment to work
hard and be as fit and as strong
as possible, and it is also a
commitment to your
teammates.”

Student restartsdefunct rowing program

According to Sheppard, the
team plans to start training in
Lake Robertson, then transition
to the Maury River after the
athletes have some experience.
There are currently thirty people
on the e—mail list that are
interested in joining the team.

“Since most people don’t
have any rowing experience
prior to college, a start-up
program such as this one could,
with some work, develop into a
strong one in a few years,”

, Sheppard said.

Crew depends solely upon the
unification of the team.
V “If a team is not working well

together, the boat will go
nowhere, and it will be a pretty
miserable row,” Shinoﬁeld said.

If the sport gets backed
financially and the interest
remains high, it will likely get
approved as a club sport on
campus. .

“There are so many lessons to
be learned from rowing, on and
off the water,” Shinoﬁeld said.
“The only way to row well and
to go fast is if everyone in the
boat is completely in sync,
mentally and physically.
Figuring out how to do this is
challenging but extremely
fulfilling.”

Athletes

  dominate  
dodgeball  

’ Rugby and track combine for victory

By Rosemary Boyle
STAFF WRITER

Although the 2nd An-
‘ nual Dodgeball Tourna-
ment did not draw as large
of a crowd as it did last
year, no one would have
guessed that the players
were not in front of a
packed stadium from how
intensely they dodged,
ducked, dipped, dove and
dodged.

At one point, freshman
Addison Sanford was left to
fend off ﬁve hulking play-
ers from team, “The
Lodge,” and was able to
eliminate two before his fi-
nal downfall. His end,
however, did not come eas-
ily to his opponents. Ac-
cording to Sanford, he has
been practicing for quite
some time now. “I lift in the
morning and have been fo-
cusing on improving my
ninja-like dodging skills,”
he said. This particularly
challenging moment of the
night “was tough,” said

, Sanford.
The Lodge, champions

of the first round, also

dominated in the second
and semiﬁnal round. Fight-
ing to win the champion-

ship, they faced a team I

which consisted of both
track and rugby players; a
combination which turned
out to be winning too
strong for them.

After one win for The‘

Lodge, the track and rugby
stars came back strong by
winning two in a row and
taking the match. The vic-
tory celebration included
“going to Dominos!” said
the team.

According to Will
Patterson, Campus Recre-
ation Coordinator, the
Dodgebali tournament
started last year as a result
of a need for “freshmen to
have something fun to do
the first week of winter
term.” The tradition contin-
ues, providing a great op-
portunity for what the In-
tramural Catalog describes
as a chance to “throw
something at that annoying
kid in class... to let out
some of that aggression.”

“Let out some of that aggression. ”

  Fightirig for her life

Well—loved Director of Student Aﬁairs Ann Tomlinson struggles against cancer

She thought it was her gallbladder. During a

summer camping trip, she began to feel discom-

fort under her ribcage, and diagnosed herself,

vowing to go to the doctor when she and her hus-

band got home. The doctors told her differently.

Her gallbladder was ﬁne, but the CT scan

showed a mass on her ovary. In July of this year,

they diagnosed her with Stage III ovarian cancer.

By Steph Wiechmann
STAFF WRITER

Ann Tomlinson, AdrI1inistra-
tive Assistant to Student Affairs,
didn’t believe it at first. Her fa-
ther had survived colon cancer,
but there was no history of ova-
rian cancer on either side of her
family. But, the following
Wednesday, she was wheeled off
to surgery, where surgeons “de-
bulked” the mass and performed
a total hysterectomy. Then, they
put on a chemotherapy schedule.

“My mom cried,” said

Tomlinson when she informed,

her family. “My husband cried.”
Her two sons, Andrew and Chris-
topher, both juniors at
Bridgewater College, have not
comprehended it yet, she feels.

Her bosses, Dean Dave
Leonard and Dean Tammy
Futrell, took it hard. And, it was
their job to tell the student Resi-
dence Life Staff when they re-
turned in August.

“The students have been won-
derful,” Tomlinson said. In fact,
when they learned of her diag-
nosis, 35 of them showed up in

her living room with a sheet cake
and balloons.

Tomlinson has had to cutback
her hours at work to accommo-
date her chemotherapy schedule
and side effects of the treatment,
but so counts herself as pretty
lucky. '

“I’ve lost most of my hair,”
she says, reminding me of the
gray head—wrap she wears, “and
I recently have had a few intesti-
nal problems.” But, so far, she
said, that’s it.

She is thankful that the treat-
ments don’t leave her as tired as
they do most patients. “They

usually give me a rush,” she
adds.

Her appetite, too, has not
been affected. “I could eat that
paper,” she jokes, pointing to my
notebook. “If you seasoned it
up.” Going into December, this
is a good thing, since Christmas
is one of her favorite holidays.

One experience at the begin-
ning of her treatment stands, to
her, as an inspiration of how to
deal with this diagnosis.

Tomlinson, during her pre-
surgery prep, was waiting for a
chest x—ray in a Roanoke hospi-
tal this summer. An elderly
woman, in a matching hospital
gown, came in and sat down in
the waiting room. She asked
Tomlinson a question, then be-
gan to explain what she was hav-
ing done that day.

Tomlinson thought, “Oh no, I
don’t know her from Adam, and
now she’s going to sit here and
tell me everything that is wrong.”

The woman explained her
current situation, mentioned that
she was 80-years—old, and then
said, “I had ovarian cancer.”
Tomlinson was shocked, but
didn’t say a word. The woman,

“If _you let it, it will

consume y0I/l C0111-

pletely. You may not

have but two or three
years left, but you

make the most of it. ”

who had been diagnosed with the
disease 25 years ago, began to
talk about her diagnosis, her sur-
gery, her chemotherapy, and her
recovery.

After finishing, the woman
looked at Tomlinson and asked,
“What are you here for?”

Tomlinson answered, “I was
just diagnosed with ovarian can-
cer.”

“You’ll be ﬁne,” the woman
said immediately. “Don’t listen
to a word they have to say. You’ll
be just fine.”

The nurse then called the
woman’s name, and she got up
and left the room. Tomlinson
never saw her again.

“That woman was put there
for a reason,” Tomlinson tells me
with a look of absolute faith on
her face.

Speaking with her, her upbeat
attitude may surprise some.
Stage III cancer is one stage
away from being considered
“terminal,” and yet, Tomlinson is
determined to beat this.

“If you let it, it will consume
you completely,” she said. “You
may not have but two or three
years left, but you make the most
of it. I may survive it, but I’ll
always have it in the back of my
mind.”

She has just ﬁnished her fifth
chemo treatment out of eight
planned sessions, and does not
intend to stop living just because
of the diagnosis.

“I know it happened for a rea-

' son,” Tomlinson says with con-

viction. “I’m not sure yet what
that reason is, but I think it was
to get my attention. Listen to
people. Be appreciative.”

THE RING-TUM PHI ' 3

  DIIIIOIIS

 

 

edﬂoﬁal
Mission? not impossible

The Phi staﬁ makes a new version of a I09-year—old paper

The Phi has not always been
something to be proud of.

Don’t get us wrong: a century
of tradition makes for automatic
prestige and a certain amount of
recognition in the liberal arts
college circles.

But we plan to rest on our
laurels no more.

A reputation for fouled—up
stories led to a near—lockdown
between the Phi and anyone
worth speaking to on campus. A
long history of extreme stress and
severe disorganization led to a
high turnoverrate for staff

members. A lack of commitment
led to a series of bumt-out editors
and worthless clips for would—be
joumalists.

Observing this, the Phi, with
our new editor—in-chief, has made
a new year’s resolution to
improve.

Our first step is to give the
paper an identity. We created a
new mission statement. We
considered our audience and how
we want to reach you. We thought
about what we want to achieve
during our time here on staff. We
thought about continuity and

tradition. We thought about real
journalism.

This is what we came up with:

The mission of the Ring—Tum
Phi is to accurately, truthfully,
and thoroughly report news
affecting the Washington and Lee
community for students, faculty,
parents and alumni. Our goal is
to look deeper into news affecting
campus life and hold leaders
accountable. Through our
reporting. we aspire to spark
discussions that ‘lead to
discovering information that
prompts change.

We invite you to join us on our
journey this year. Track our
development through the issues,
and tell us what you think. We’d
love to see more letters to the
editor, good and bad.

We are growing as an
organization, and - looking
forward to new developments,
including a website.

We are students——help us learn.
Stick with us while we turn this
paper into something we can all
be proud of.

The above editorial represents
the majority opinion ofThe Ring-
tum Phi editorial board.

Without a parent organization

You can still have a lot of ran-
dom fun, and experience personal
growth as a Greek. I have several
friends who have found ways to
balance their involvement with a
fraternity or sorority with their

 personal and intellectual growth.

In fact, I think the use of the term
“independent” might better de-
scribe a stateof mind, rather than
one’s Greek status. You can ﬁnd
“independents” in the fraternities,
and the fraternities are very inclu-
sive in the sense that anyone can
go to their parties (including non
Greeks), This is one of the best
aspects of the Greek system here.
Despite this, there are several
advantageous features of living
outside the Greek system. The

As a Greek, you will need to
take the initiative yourself to seek
out people who will engage you
in stimulating conversations that
stretch your assumptions about the
world (which is almost impossible
to do at a party).

As an Independent, you will be ’

thrown together with people who
see the world very differently than
you do, and it will become a mat-
ter of psychological survival to
ﬁnd ways to get along with them.
Additionally, it is easier to get to
know members of the opposite sex
as friends, rather than hook-up
partners, because there is more in-
teraction in a non-party setting.

friends to betray you. But, if'_
you treat people with honesty,
you will soon find people who
will respect you genuinely.
These people are true friends
and one of them is worth more
than a thousand sycophants.

Finally, you realize very
quickly that the world does not

freshman, it is easy to be de-

fun life at W&L can be, but in
the end what really matters are
your friends.

Whether you join a frater-

ever sacriﬁce your meaningful

people regardless of how
“cool” they are. You can have
