University administration plans major renovations for school’s iconic Colonnade

 

Field hockey standout cites team support as key to success

By Katherine Greene
MANAGJNG EDITOR

Field hockey is Kendall
Korte’s life.

Fighting through an injury to
her groin for the majority of the
season, Korte deﬁed all ‘odds,
being named to the all-
tournament and all~ODAC

teams after the Generals won the
ODACS two weeks ago.

“Going into theseason, [the

team’s} goal was to win the
/ODACS, and we made it,” she
said. 3

During the summer, coach

Wendy Orrison mailed each of

the teammates a card listing the
goals of the team for the year.

The team surprised the
school by meeting those goals
and winning the 0DACs, the
first ﬁeld hockey team in W&L
history to do so.

“We had the mindset going
into the season that we were
going to win,” said Korte. “We
knew it was important to host,
especially because we’re
definitely a turf team now.”

She explained that playing
field hockey on turf is a
completely different game,
saying that it is much faster-
paced, with the added advantage

that only one other team in the
division has a turf ﬁeld.

“We only lost one game at
home,” Korte said, naming the
turf as a contributing factor to
the team’s nearly-unbeatable
status at home.

Field hockey remains a year-

round activity to Korte, who
, spent the summer working with

a trainer who helps out with the
national Women’s field hockey
team.

‘.‘I did all the same workouts

as they did,” she saidgadding

that the toughness of her
regimen improved her
athleticism.

'When"'mos.t peoplejﬂiink about Washington and
 University, they think about the Colonnade, and
with good reason. It is the first thing one sees when
driving onto campus, and upon arrival, the
Co10m1ade’s image is everywhere: on t-shirts, posters,
and swipecards.,’i,A1th0ugh it is the most historic and
iconicipart of campus, it is about to receive an update.

Because of the lack of technology and inadequate
facilities of the classrooms, the buildings making up the
colonnade—Newcomb, Payne, Washington, Robinson
and Tucker Halls—-will undergo a major renovation in
the coming years, Joe Grasso, Vice President of
Administration and Campus Chair of the Space Planning
Committee, said.

Grasso, although he is the overseer of the project,
said it was not his idea to renovate the Colonnade.

“[Former president] Tom Burish, before he left, had
quiet discussions about the need to renovate the
Colonnade,” Grasso said. “[Current acting president
Harlan] Beckley came out with a list of eight goals he
hopes to fulﬁll, or at least start, at W&L, and that’s what’s
prompted us forward. Colonnade renovation is one of
his key goals.”

University architect Tom Contos said that faculty
members with ofﬁces and classrooms in the Colonnade
also expressed the need for an upgrade.

“There has been discussion over the past couple of
years by faculty in these buildings expressing the desire
to have the spaces renovated,” Contos said. “After
modernizing other parts of campus, such as the commons
and the Lenfest center, we see there is a need to update
these buildings.”

Grasso agreed that the recent renovations of other
buildings on campus has left the Colonnade’s classrooms
seemingly defunct.

BEHIND
BARS

Here ’s to laughing at the expense of those who
‘learned their lessons this weekend. News editor
Jacob Geiger took a peek at this week’s police

reports to see what you ’ve been up to...don’t

worry, we only used your initials!

Not twice as Nice

Police kindly informed SC of
Kennet Square, PA that he
cannot travel at nearly twice
the speed limit. In Lexing-
ton, it appears 25 means 25,
not 48. Mr. SC will be fur-
ther reminded when he pays
his speeding ticket. Bear that
in mind next time you swing
through town, please.

Another good reason to
obey the spped limit

At least 36-year-old PC of
Richmond was only going 42
in the 25 zone. That, how-
ever, may turn out to be the
least of his worries. While
the officer would have let the
speeding off with only a
ticket, PC’s refusal to cooper-
ate, DUI, and Concealed
Weapons charges all meant
he finished his trip in the
back seat of a squad car at
1:05 on a Sunday morning.
Seeing as this is Lexington’s
second concealed weapons
violation in a month, students
may want to talk with the ad-
ministration about their
policy prohibiting firearms.
Just for the safety of the stu-
dents, of course.

The neighbors were tired

Pi Phi may be known around
campus for their weekend
late nights, but by 3:06 AM

on Sunday, October 23”‘ the
police had heard enough.
And so, without further ado,
they gave PH a ticket for
“Loud Noise.” Not ‘noise
violation’ or ‘failure to ob-
tain a proper noise permit,’
just “Loud Noise.” I guess
by 3 am the officers are too
tired to come up with more
precise descriptions on the
tickets. Anyone interested in
more information on loud
noises can attend PH’s trafﬁc
court hearing at 9 am on No-
vember 29"‘.

Aloha!

Hawaiians love to party, but
22-year-old BK of Mililani,
Hawaii learned that the Lex-
ington Police would prefer he
doesn’t party all night long.
They nabbed BF last month
at 5:15 AM on a Saturday
morning. Maybe it’s a good
thing, then, that Lambda’s
“Tropical” party broke up at
a more reasonable hour but
it’s too bad, really. The
early-moming breakfast
places around town would
have been opening up in
about two or three hours.

This might mean extra
guard duty

Just when you thought Ha-
waiians and W&L students

had a monopoly on DIP ar-

rests, VMI Keydet JN comes
along. The fun loving resi-
dent of W&L’s neighboring
institution was arrested at
1:05 AM. Maybe he wanted
to get the arrest over early so
he could make it back for
curfew. Perhaps this is also
why VMI doesn’t let the stu-
dents out most nights. What-
ever the case may be, Behind
Bars suspects that the Com-
mandant was not pleased.

And now for something new
Finally, for the very first time,
Behind Bars has a felony to
report. BF, a 26-year-old fe-
male resident of Lexington,
was arrested for welfare fraud
and not one, not two, but four
counts of perjury. So not
only does BF  to cheat the
government, she lies about
her efforts. BF, cases like
yours are what gets the W&L
College Republicans so
worked up about welfare.
Anyone interested in learning
more about BF may have to
wait a bit; a court date has
not yet been set.

Drug Bust ,

Oh the felonies... apparently
the changing leaves have
brought changing crime pat-
terns. JK of Goshen became
Rockbridge County’s latest

offender when she was

charged with obtaining pre-
scriptions by fraud. So next
time you think it’s a good
idea to borrow your friend’s
Ritalin prescription to have a
little fun, remember 26-year-
old JK and just say no. At
least if you get caught drunk
you’re just facing a misde-
meanor; fraudulent prescrip-
tions could ship you off to
the Rockbridge Country
Penitentiary.

Hide the children

Finally, a big BOO from the
Phi to GG of Clearwater,
Florida. Ms. G, age 44, basi-
cally killed Lexington’s Hal-
loween spirit by getting ar-
rested for public drunken-
ness at 9:50 pm. 9:50!
Goodness gracious. Travel-
ler hasn’t even started run-
ning at 9:50. That’s pa-
thetic, GG, and shame on
you for making a fool out of
yourself in front of innocent
children hoping for a safe,
fun evening of trick—or—treat—
ing. Please return to
Clearwater and never come
back. At least W&L students
have the decency not to get
drunk in front of trick-or-
treaters.

Colonnade upgrade on horizon

Continued from page 1

“We have a beautiful new
science facility, and are in the
process of building more space for
arts and music,” Grasso said.
“This is our chance to provide the
humanities departments with
modern teaching and learning
facilities for both faculty and
students.”

Philosophy professor Lad
Sessions teaches in Newcomb
Hall and asserted that the
colonnade is in desperate need of
an update.

“The colonnade is W&L’s
signature, and it is in the worst
shape of the entire school,”
Sessions said. “It projects an
image of shabby gentility, not of
cutting-edge education.”

It is this “cutting-edge
education” that the administration
is striving to achieve through
renovation of these historic
buildings. However, their
historical significance is an
important factor in the renewal
process, Contos said. '

“Because the buildings are a
national landmark, they will be
resorted with great care,” Contos
said. “The colonnade will retain
the same look on the exterior,
except that the exterior air

» conditioning units will not be

there.”
Grasso added that other

necessary features will be added
to the buildings in addition to air
conditioning. The buildings will
become code compliant for fire
safety (a feature which the
buildings are currently lacking),
and will also become
handicapped accessible—the
installation of elevators is “very
likely,” Grasso said. Bathrooms
will also be updated and will
become handicapped accessible,
as they are currently, as Grasso
said, “atrocious.”

Contos added that the
colonnade buildings have not
been renovated in about 70 years.

“The buildings have not been
touched since 1936 when they
were fireproofed,” Contos said.
“This project will preserve these
buildings for another 80-100
years of more practical use.”

Sessions added that the
buildings are not currently
equipped with enough space in
which to teach.

“Newcomb Hall is twice as
crowded in terms of square
footage per faculty member as the
Williams School, which has its
own complaints,” Sessions said.

Adequate electrical capacity is
another important feature that will
be added to the buildings, Grasso
said, stressing that, “if we don’t
have the electrical capacities we
need to charge the technologies
available to us, it defeats the

academic purpose of the school.”

Although there is much to be
done to update the colonnade to
match the quality of the rest of the
school, Grasso said the renovation
will be a long process, and the
administration is still its the early
planning stages.

One year ago, W&L received
a $150,000 grant from the Getty
Foundation in order to begin the
renovation process.

The Getty Foundation is an
organization that sponsors,
according to its website, “the
research, documentation, and
analysis necessary to the
development of a comprehensive
conservation plan [for]
projects [which] focus on the
historic structure and fabric of the
building(s) and address
conservation issues related to the
building’s setting.”

Grasso said that W&L used the
money to “measure and document
how important the colonnade is in
terms of historical architecture.”

“It has given us a lot of good
advice on how to maintain the
historic look of the campus,. and
lays the groundwork on the
rehabilitation of the colonnade,”
Grasso said.

Contos added that the money
will assist the university in hiring
a consultant who will create a
preservation renovation plan.

“We want to modernize the

buildings,” Contos said, “but also
preserve them as they are national
historical landmarks.”

Currently the Space Planning
Committee, comprised of faculty
and staff, is interviewing
nationally known architectural
firms, Grasso said. This interview
process will occur over the next
few weeks.

With the help of the architect,
the committee will conduct a
feasibility study to determine what
each building will house, in terms
of the number of classrooms and
offices. According to Grasso, this
should be completed by the
summer of 2006.

Then the project will enter the
design faze, wherein the architects
will start designing the interiors of
each building.

“We have two options for
renovating the interiors,” Grasso
said. “We can either gut each
building, like we did to Reed Hall,
and start from scratch, or keep the
interior structure and work with
it.”

Grasso said that the committee
prefers to keep the interior
structure of each building and
update so as not to “lose the
historical appearance” of the
buildings.

Once the design faze has
completed, construction will
begin. Grasso estimates that this
should be during the late summer

or fall of 2007.

Contos said that because of the
magnitude of the project, the
architects will employ “stage
construction,” meaning one
building will undergo renovation
at a time. Grasso said Newcomb
Hall will be the first building to
undergo renovation, which leaves
35 faculty members without office
space.

“Once the art and music
departments move from Dupont
Hall, it will serve to house those
who are forced to move because
of construction,” Grasso said.

Right now neither Grasso nor
Contos can say how long the
construction will last, nor can they
say how much the renovation will
cost. The entire cost of the project,
however, will not come from
W&L alone, Contos said.

“We don’t know how much the
project will ultimately cost,
though it will be a large dollar
number,” Contos said. “Tax
credits are typically allowed for
projects like these where historic
properties are renovated.”

In addition to hoping for help
from the government, Grasso
hopes that the school’s alumni and
other affiliates will donate to the
cost of construction.

“The plan is to raise money for
much of [the overall cost],”
Grasso said. “The administration
knows that these buildings are

iconic of the school and our goal
is to rely on philanthropy.”

Despite the cost of the project,
Sessions sees the reconstruction as
one that will improve the
university’s academics.

“The departments housed in its
buildings deserve more and better
space, and we have every
assurance from the administration
that help is on the way,” Sessions
said.

Grasso hopes the renovation
will offer students and faculty
more spaces to interact.

“We all hope the Colonnade
will provide social and acaderriic
interaction between students and
faculty,” Grasso said. “For
example, having lounge space
where students and faculty can
meet, rooms for conferences
between students, and classrooms
with air conditioning so you can
hear what’s being said. Those are
the ways we hope the university
will beneﬁt from this renovation.”

Although the exterior
appearance and historical
signiﬁcance of the Colonnade will
remain unchanged, the
administration hopes that through
renovation, alumni will return to
campus and see the colonnade not
only as a national landmark, but
also as the center of their college
education.

heart.”

This confidence in one
another led the team places they
never thought they’d go, which
is partly why they lost so quickly
in the NCAA tournament, said
Korte.

“It’s kind of a weird feeling,”
she said, on winning the ODACs
and then ending the season so
quickly.

She said that the team didn’t
play up to their abilities in the
NCAA tournament, and names
intimidation as the culprit.

“I guess it’s just sour grapes,”
she said, “but we didn’t really
know what to expect.”

The success of several
women’s athletic teams has
sparked an enthusiastic reaction
from fans, several of whom
created a facebook group in their
honor. The group, called “Uber
Fans” and started by senior Chris
Lalli, claims to be “for those who
are extremely dedicated to all
female sports teams.”

Lalli, along with friends and
fellow fans Taylor McConnell,
Dave Mackenzie, and Scott
Gosselink, attended many if not
all of the women’s ﬁeld hockey
games this year.

Gosselink said, “The main
reason that we support the ﬁeld
hockey team is because we can
relate to them as athletes
ourselves.

' “It sucks to work so hard and
have no one go to the games or
know that you play. The girls are
simply a delight.”

Korte said, “I’m actually not
friends with any of them, but the
support is awesome.”

Gelinas agreed that the
support from the men is always
helpful.

“[They] have always been
sincere supporters of our team
even when we were not breaking
records. I really appreciate their
support and it is comforting and
encouraging to see these fans at
every game,” she said.

The impending graduation of
several key players on the ﬁeld
hockey team threatens the
repetition of this season’s
victories.

“I’m really going to miss the
seniors,” Korte said. “Not only as
field hockey players and
teammates, but I’m going to miss
them more as friends.”

Despite this, Korte said she
fully intends to return to the
NCAA tournament in the
following years.

“I’m stoked that we’ve made
it so far,” she said. “Next time,
we won’t be fazed by it.”

Short by a goal

McCraw put a penalty kick in the
back of EMU’s net in the ﬁnal
minutes of the first half; it was
the midﬁelder’s third goal of the
season.

The Generals were not able to
score the equalizer in the second
half. The score held and W&L’s
season was ended giving the
squad a 9-6-2 overall (5-2-2 in
the ODAC) record.

Sophomore goalkeeper Ted
Sheedy had four saves while his
EMU counterpart, Tim Koehn,

-notched ﬁve.

“It was disappointing,” said
senior midfielder Brett

Strohsacker, “We played our

hearts out and that’s all you can
ask for.”

Indeed it was a frustrating loss
for the Generals, who possessed
the ball for nearly 70% of the
game according to the estimation
of senior captain and defender
Derrick Lott. 0

“We had our chances but we
couldn’t.put them away,” said
Lott.

The loss ends a season that
saw the Generals play in six
double-overtime games and
seven OT games overall.

The team was 3-2-2 in those
games. One of those extra time
wins came on October 18 against

Roanoke, a victory that Lott de-
scribes as “the best moment of
the season.”

The season was an up and
down one for the Generals who
had trouble building momentum
because they never won more
than two matches in a row. How-
ever they only dropped tw
straight games once. -

Sophomore forward Jack
Palmer ends the season as the
team leader in both goals (11)
and overall points (24).

Palmer is followed in points
by sophomore Josh Dodds (15)
andjunior Kyle Garcia (13).

Ted Sheedy led the Generals

in virtually every goalkeeping
statistic including wins (7), saves
(46) and shutouts (2).

Lott, the senior captain, was
quick to praise the team as a
whole when asked about the sea-
son: “Our record is a testament
to how well we played together.”

Friday’s loss ends the playing
days of seven seniors, including
Lott.

“After 17 years of playing
soccer it’s a big moment. I would
have liked to go out on top but

136-69, the women endured
their second defeat of the
season, losing by a score of
118-82. ’

Even though the team lost
overall, Holda still placed
first in the 200 free and
helped Mahoney. Miata and
Strachan take first in their
400 free relay with a time of
3:49.71.

also won the 200
breaststroke event with a
time of 2236.38.

Paris Hilton politics

Despite an America For Dummies attitude of Blue v. Red, we’re all really purple

By Mary Childs
COLUMNIST

It’s a given fact that this is a
conservative school. I could make
all the requisite jokes about,
“Well, what do you expect, the
name LEE is in the title,” and
“Good old boy” and “rich” and
“Southem” and “white” and “frat”
and all signs point to Bush. That’s
Jim Dandy and I understand that
and I knew that when I came here,
frying pan into the ﬁre.

However. There has been a
phenomenon as of late that must
be nipped in the cradle. It is a ter-
rible and democracy-threatening
ideal. Even Bush would probably
not advocate it. He may even go
so far as to call it terrorism, be-
cause it does threaten our freedom
and our ideals. It’s the Paris Hilton
and Sean “Puffy” Combs (excuse
me, “Diddy”) approach to politi-

cal . It’s America for Dummies.

We are a land of sports lovers.
We love our Andy Roddick and
Astros and Kobe and everybody
for the blood, sweat and tears we
pay for. We thrive on adrenaline,
testosterone — our high—powered
business world loves to tell India
what to do and Hollywood can pat
itself on the back for its complete
monopoly on movie land. And
good for us. These are the fruits
of our labor.

But what got us here? What
made us so great? What is in our
blood that makes us froth at the
mouth a little any time a baseball
ﬂies near the stands? It’s a basic
part of our American genome —
we’re intensely competitive.

Competition is a relatively
healthy thing; it makes us do our
best, it pushes us when we want
to be lazy, and sometimes we win.
Fabulous. But a problem arises

when we try to mix work and play,
baseball and Bush. What happens
is we forget those magnificent
many-syllabled words like “bipar-
tisanship,” and
“antidisestablishmentarianism,”

, “teamwork,” “passing legisla-

tion,” and “democracy,” and we
start thinking that this is a sports
game, What’s the score?

When Rehnquist died I an-
nounced it to some of my friends
and noted that Bush would have
another nomination to the Court.
A friend of mine (who is slightly
more liberal than your average
bear here) (so like, moderate) and
I explained to a completely Red
friend the possible implications in
terms of Roe v. Wade. This is dan-
gerous for your uterus, we ex-
plained. We could be f-ed, in more
ways than one. Red Friend appar-
ently didn’t follow. “Well, Great!”
she said with enthusiasm. Awk-

ward pause. “Because if you’re f-
ed, then that means we’re win-
ning! ha-hall”

Reread that.

This is the watered down po-
litical game that we’re playing.
We’re playing Red v. Blue, Bush
v. anyone, Righteous Right v.
Bleeding Hearts. But much like
Paris missed the registration dead-
line, we’re missing the point. The
point of the two-party system, of
the more-than-one-party-system is
more along the work-together-
and-make-progress, checks—and-
balances side of things. There is
no scoreboard here. No one should
“lose” this game. It’s a bunch of
blind people holding each others
hands and fumbling down the path
of almost-righteousness as best we
can. One nation. Indivisible. Don’t
let the slogans and Chihuahuas
and baseball-managing confuse
you; inside, we’re all purple.

UPS&DOWNS

Caley Anderson gives his take
on the good, the bad, and the ugly.

0 White Book Review.
Come to the meetings that will
work to change the White
Book, every Thursday at
7:45pm in the University
Commons. W&L students,
faculty, and staff are welcome
to propose and discuss pos-
sible changes with the Review
Committee. This only happens
once per three years- get in-
volved!

0 La France.

The real causes of the riots are
cultural. France demands po-
litico-social conformity of its
citizens, and politico-social
conformity is not something
that most’Muslims are willing
to get into. It’s tough to say
who’s to blame, but one
thing’s for sure- the damage
and deaths are good for no
one.

0 The Hold ‘Em Poker
hand of Pocket Jacks.

In the recent IM poker tour-
nament, EIGHT people were

sent packing on this hand, in-
cluding yours ever-so-truly.

0 Thanksgiving Break.

0 Winter Break.

It’s STH.L only two weeks?
I’ve never met ANYONE
who was against having a
three—week long Winter
Break. If the academic year
runs to June 8 or 9, I’m sure
very few people would care.
If you live far away from
campus (or in my case, on
the opposite side of the coun-
try), the two week Winter

WHY WORK FOR WHAT IS FREE

RANDOM PLAY IS NOT OKAY

By Ashley Brightwall
COLU M NIST

It’s Saturday night, and you
know what that means.

Through the course of the week
you’ve received various emails
from frats (as well as notes stuck
to your door) declaring what
bands, DJs and alcoholic bever-
ages will be featured this week-
end.

Now, it’s time to go to these
parties, under the pretense of ac-
tually wanting to hear the bands,

. get drunk and find that special

someone of the evening.

It will be incredibly romantic
and meaningful of course: having
deep conversations over Natty
Lite, engaging in sketchy dancing
in the middle of a crowded room
that feels like it’s about one hun-
dred and ten degrees, and then
finding a secluded room, or
comer...or maybe just saying to
hell with it and making out in the

middle of the dance ﬂoor, only to
forget the person’s name later.

Ah, young love.

Here at W&L, hooking up is a
perfectly normal part of any week-
end. I’m not saying that this is al-
ways a bad thing.

Every so often people just need
to be able to have fun without any
strings attached or feeling any
guilt later.

However, hooking up has com-
pletely replaced dating on this
campus, to the point where the
only time people really interact
with the opposite sex is at frat par-
ties.

Can anyone really ﬁnd a mean-
ingful connection with all the al-
cohol and loud music? Can you
even ﬁnd out the person’s name?

It’s just not healthy to limit re-
lationships to hooking up on
weekends, even if it’s what some
call “hooking up exclusively”,
where both individuals meet up
every weekend and limit their in-

teractions to one another. Some
consider this a relationship, but
there are far too many problems
involved.

In these situations, it is too easy
for one party to become more in-
volved than the other, ending in
heartbreak when the trysts even-
tually end.

Then you ask yourself, if you
really have a connection with this
person, why do you never see each
other outside of parties?

This sort of “relationship” just
isn’t healthy.

We need to work toward facili-
tating healthier and more stable
interactions between the sexes,
which means not limiting our-
selves to random play.

If we don’t allow ourselves to
develop healthy relationship hab-
its now, how will we ever func-
tion after college, in a world that
doesn’t center around frat parties
and the ever present possibility of
a random hookup?

By Justin McKeen
COLU M N IST

What’s the big deal with dat-
ing? Certain people (read, fe-
males) at W&L seem to regard this
awkward and uncomfortable prac-
tice with some kind of irrational
fondness. I say irrational because
any sane person can see that din-
ner and a movie don’t bring you
any closer to someone than talk-
ing in the co-op or catching din-
ner in the d—hall, neither of which
would qualify as dates where I
come from. Not only that, but dat-
ing brings with it a whole host of
problems: when is it time for the
ﬁrst kiss, who should call whom
and where the heck am I going to
ﬁnd the 20 bucks to pay for her
dinner.

Lets all be realistic here. The
dating scene at W&L seems pretty
non-existent, yet the world still
seems to be spinning in much the
same way it always has. The most

common complaint I hear on the
subject (again, mostly from the
ladies. Ahh, who are we kidding,
entirely from the ladies), is that all
everyone here wants to do is
“hook up.” Is this a surprise to
you? Have at least eighteen years
on this earth taught you nothing
about the male psyche? You’re
pretty, we like that, A‘ follows B,
etc, etc. Hopefully you see where
I’m going here.

The most important point
though is that this lack of dating

' ISN’T bad. In fact it’s great. Girls,

when that annoying/ugly/non-polo
wearing guy (take your pick) both-
ers you, and you, for some totally
non-alcohol related reason choose
to hook up with him, THERE ARE
NO STRINGS ATTACHED! It’s
brilliant. He’s not going to
facebook you and awkwardly call
you up for a date ‘(although he
might still facebook you. Wel-
come to the modern age of stalk-

‘ing.). Sure, you don’t get those

free dinners, but you wouldn’t
want to pass up the fro-yo in the
d—hall anyway, right?

I

So now that I’ve completely ‘

destroyed any chances of ever get-
ting a date myself, let’s be serious
for a moment. Unless dating has
been a completely different expe-
rience for everyone else, I think
on the whole, we can agree that it
isn’t really that great. There are
tons of other ways to get to know
members of the opposite sex than

“dating” per se, and most of them 8

are more fun anyway. So the next
time you want to get to know a
guy (because I know guys aren’t
going to change) don’t wait for

him to ask you out. It isn’t com— '

ing. Try something creative. And
if all else fails, hook up with him.
It’s foolproof.

All angry e-mails should be
sent to mckeenj@wlu.edu where
they will be carefully read, shared
with my friends if they’re really
funny, and promptly deleted.

By Bhaskar Banerjee
CO LU M N I ST

Times are strange. Freedom is
being enforced at gunpoint, real-
ity is being pre-packaged into 24
minute episodes shown on TV,
and everywhere everything is for
sale.

So, with Jim Morrison croon-
ing “strange days have found us”
over my old speakers I was seized
with a sudden and frantic urge to
write stuff down, and give my
opinion on the world and culture
and the way things are going.

Why not? I thought, college
brochures are always talking about
diversity of thought, about every-
one beneﬁting from listening to
different opinions, and similar
stuff which makes us feel all warm
and fuzzy and democratic.

I’m an international student,
with different views on a lot of
things, I thought, and so of course
the good people will benefit from
my eloquently penned socio—po—
litical rants.

And so here I am, contemplat-
ing the strange going-on’s in this
weird and ruthless new century.
Everything’s peachy, the suits on
top tell us with their smug grins,
the light of freedom and truth and
all that’s good is being delivered
to grateful desert savages, and the

3 policeman is your friend.

But of course, the grim and
twisted realities of this foul year
are another story, and it is impos-
sible for anyone to deny this with-
out retreating into heavy sedation.
Even if you are one of those who
thinks that a war in which one side
armed with big tanks and big guns
blasts an essentially deprived citi-
zenry into a new era of truth and
justice is right, things are bad.

Veterans are speaking
out, families who have seen, up
close and personal, the cold hy-

pocrisy of the war machine.
300,000 protestors gathered at the
White House last month, I read,
and many veterans spoke about
the many atrocities, on both sides,
committed during the fraudulent
war in the desert lands.

And then I heard Bush giving
another speech on freedom, de-
mocracy, and I was suddenly in
the grip of a cold and desolate fear.
Holy Jesus, I thought, clutching a
whiskey-soaked cigarette packet
to my heart, how much longer will
this thing last?

Freedom? Ha. Today freedom
is merely having 600 channels on
the TV to choose from. We are all
so scared of losing our home the-
ater systems, our clever little de-
signer furniture, and all those
other gadgets and widgets which
define men in this age of the holy
consumer, that we aren’t free to
do anything with our lives any
more.

And on top of that, our leaders
scare us even more, and you’d
think you couldn’t walk the streets
anymore without being croaked by
some savage foreigner.

Even people like journalists
and lobbyists who want to make a
difference quickly realize that the
worlds political structure has been
so hijacked by corporate barons
and greasy sheikhs that they don’t
have any chance of bringing about
change.

Fear hit me when I submitted
this little opinion piece to the pa-
per: what if some goon in some
nazi law enforcement agency saw
these decidedly dissenting opinion
pieces in print, written by a for-
eigner, no less.

They’d come right after my
pinko tree-hugger ass, shotguns
blazing. And if, like me, you are a
165 pound Indian with long greasy
hair, usually loaded on cheap
booze, there are few places to hide
in Lexington.

» LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Alum blasts
dearfs meddling

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to
Marshall Rule’s article “Dean
Swings Left” in the October 27"‘
edition of The Phi.

I am incensed by Dean
Mayock’s blatant violation of
W&L’s unique system of student
governance.

Those of you who know me
are probably not surprised by my
reaction considering my personal
political views and the fact that
I was a member of the Contact
Committee.

Ignore my views, and ignore
yours for a moment. Look at the
more fundamental problem that
Dean Mayock’s request to bring
a “politically liberal” speaker
poses.

Meddling by the
administration into activities
solely governed by student
organizations with student
tuition dollars intended for
student academic programming
chips away at an invaluable
learning experience for the
leaders of those organizations.

While I certainly learned a lot
in the classrooms of the C-
School, I learned even more in
the Commons cubicles, sorority
house chapter room, and co-op
lunch meetings through my
leadership and involvement in
student organizations. ,

One of the many special
aspects of W&L is the enormous
opportunity afforded to students
to take charge and make a
discemable impact as a leader.

W&L’s heritage promotes
student governance.

Student governance is
precisely why the Honor System
is able to exist so strongly today.
The EC allocates tuition dollars
to student organizations to
provide a more well-rounded
educational experience for the
members of those groups and for
the student body as a whole.

When the administration
steps in attempting to regulate
and limit that experience, it
deprives those student leaders
from learning in their capacity
and applying their own
judgment.

If the student leadership
makes a poor decision, they
should be afforded that
opportunity. Mistake and
controversy are also all vital
parts of the learning experience.

As a former participant in
those late—night meetings and
heated deliberations, I am fully
confident in the intelligence and
maturity of the students making
such decisions. Who better than
students to determine what other
students will respond to?

As a law student in a very
different environment than
W&L, I have had the opportunity
to get to know my new
classmates who come from a
broad array of undergraduate
experiences. Every single one is
amazed when I tell them about
W&L, particularly the student
organizations. They can’t
believe that we have an effective

Honor System run solely by
students.

They think I’m over-
exaggerating when I tell them
that over 90 percent of the
student body takes an active role
in our Mock Convention with
negligible faculty input. They
are shocked by the budget given
to the Fancy Dress Committee

and the overwhelming task of ‘

putting on one of the best parties
in the south.

The students rule the roost at
W&L. That is why we graduate
with much more than honors in
a particular subject matter. We
gain insight in balancing the
increasingly diverse interests of
the student body, in knowing our
administrators and working
WITH them (not for them), and
in attending to the Lexington
community at large.

Student leaders work for one
group: the students. They are the
future graduates, alumni,
benefactors and trustees of the
University. Their interests will
remain in Lexington through

, changes in the administration.

The students have earned the
right to go to W&L and are
capable to perform the
responsibilities that go in hand
with being Washington and Lee
student.

Dean Mayock, let them have
the full and complete education
W&L has afforded so many
students before them.

Colleague defends Mayock from student accusations

To the Editor:

If an academic Associate
Dean does his or her job well,
he or she gets little praise or
credit—the university just seems
to be running smoothly.

I can’t fault students for not
understanding this. The title
does not confer a great deal of
power and inﬂuence, but instead
demands an ethic of service:
professors like Ellen Mayock,
who came to academe because
they love and excel at teaching,
research, and writing, put their
chosen work on the back burner ‘
for three years in order to
administer the complex
academic support systems most
of us would rather not worry
about

On top of this job and its very
long hours, Dean Mayock,
because she is so exceptional in
her desire to serve the university

. community, has been working

incredibly hard on this year of
Celebrating Women at
Washington and Lee. So, you
haven’t noticed that her e—mails
come late at night, when most
parents of young children try to
grab a little sleep? I suspect she
doesn’t mind the general
obliviousness because the work

has value and integrity.

I do blame the Phi and
Marshall Rule, however, for their
misleading front—page article and
the dishonest tactics used in
“researching” it. Ellen Mayock
is not only unusually generous
and service—minded, but
scrupulously honest. If Marshall
Rule or David Kronenfeld had
described their misapprehension
to her “that the [Contact] speaker
musl come from the left,” she
would have clariﬁed it (and, not
incidentally, there wouldn’t have
been much of a story). If Mr.
Rule were concerned with
accuracy, he would have found
out that Professor Mark Rush
initiated Barbara Ehrenreich’s
visit, not the Celebrating Women
Committee. And if he were at all

committed to our supposed’

culture of civility, the tone of the
article would have been vastly
different.

If Mr. Rule meant to suggest
that many professors and
administrators are to the left of
many students, well, duh—we’re
well-educated, moderately—paid
professionals in a service field.
The demographic implications
are obvious. What “liberal”
means to most of us in this

professional context, though, is
uncensored exchange of
information and opinions in an
atmosphere of mutual respect. I
don’t want my studentsto think
exactly as I do; I just want them
to think.

If Mr. Rule, however, meant
to single out one of the only
women serving in academic
administration and let her know
she’s not welcome by distorting
her views in a splashy headline
published for Parents’ Weekend,
that’s more significant news.
Sure, we all know that some
people in our community do not
like to see women in positions

I of authority, but I did not truly

understand that the discomfort
would result in such tactics from
students, or that such unbalanced
and incredible allegations would
be implicitly endorsed by the
inﬂuential women and men who
run the Phi. As a woman
professor who has experienced
occasional rash fervor to bring
the university community
together in a positive way, I
appreciate the warning.

THE RING-TUM PHI ~

7

  been hanging the yaforg I
I posters on various campus .
f hillboards. Youth for America,‘ ;

To the Editor:

The letters page of the Phi has
seen an exchange about the White
Book procedures concerning
students withdrawing from the
University. In Ireland we have a
saying: “Is this a private ﬁght, or
can anybody join in?” I would like
to enter the lists.

On page 11, Section III,
“Executive Committee Hearing”,
Part P, “Announcement of
Verdict”, section 3, of the White
Book, it says, concerning a guilty
verdict by the EC of a closed
hearing:

“If the verdict is guilty, the
accused shall decide whether to
withdraw from the University or
to appeal the verdict to a Student
Body Hearing. The accused shall
provide written notice of this
decision to the President of the
Executive Committee within
seventy-two hours of the time of
the verdict. Upon written request,
the President of the Executive
Committee may grant an extension
of this time.”

It is important to note here that
the White Book asks the student
to make a decision, before asking
the student to provide evidence of
that decision. What is this
decision? Apparently, it is to
withdraw from the University, or
to appeal the Verdict of the closed
hearing.

On page 12, Section IV,

“Following the Executive
Committee Hearing”, Part C,
“Withdrawal”, section 3, of the
White Book, it says, concerning a
guilty verdict by the EC of a closed
hearing:

“If the student fails to provide
written notice of the student’s
decision to withdraw or to proceed
to the Student Body Hearing, this
failure shall be construed as a
decision to withdraw. “Withdrew”
shall be noted on the student’s
official University transcript. The
administration shall then be
responsible’ for the prompt
removal of the student from the
University.”

That is, if a student provides
no evidence of a decision to
withdraw or appeal, the student is
deemed to have decided to
withdraw from the University, and
the student is withdrawn from the
University. So there is no
difference between a student who
provides written notice that she is
withdrawing from the University,
and a student who provides no
such notice. Under the eyes of the
White Book, they are both
students who have decided to
withdraw, and who are withdrawn.

But there is a problem with this
procedure.

The decision to withdraw or
not from the University is distinct
from the decision to appeal, and
it must be made under the threat

of dismissal by the University, and
not under the threat of being
withdrawn.

This fact is obscured, I think,
by the presence of an option to
appeal to a Student Body Hearing.
Remove the option to appeal, and
the problem, which has always
been present, becomes clear: the
student is asked to withdraw or
not, and if she does not withdraw,
she is withdrawn.

Imagine, by comparison, that I
am told to resign my job, or appeal
to X. And imagine that I refuse to
resign or appeal to X. According
to this procedure, it turns out that
I have resigned my job. And then
a couple of people wearing
uniforms come along and “help
me resign”. But at no point, it
seems, am I fired.

Either of the following
procedures would remove this
problem:

(1) If the student is found
guilty, the student may appeal the
verdict. If the student does not
appeal the verdict, the student is
deemed to have withdrawn from
the University.

(2) If the student is found
guilty, he student may appeal the
verdict or withdraw from the
University. If the student does
neither, the student is dismissed
from the University.

I would prefer (2). For others
among you, I suspect that (1) is

True to the Intention of the
Framers, who wanted to avoid
having to note on transcripts that
students were “Dismissed” from
the -University if at all possible. I
happen to consider this to be
disingenuous, however. The
student is being dismissed. They
just don’t want to say that,

However, what the White
Book has right now, it seems, is
the following procedure:

(3) If the student is found
guilty, the student may appeal the
verdict or withdraw from the
University. If the student does
neither, the student is deemed to

have withdrawn from the
University.

As I said, this incorporates the
following:

(3*) If the student is found
guilty, the student may withdraw
from the University. If the student
does not, the student is deemed to
have withdrawn from the
University. ~

The problem may be, in the
end, a problem with the verb
“withdraw”. I can withdraw
myself, or I can be withdrawn by
others. Under the White Book, it
seems, I always withdraw myself.
Even when others withdraw me.

Night
on the
town

By Kate Shellnutt

STAFF WRITER

The Gender Relations
Committee claimed “Dating is
Backl” as it promoted its second
Date Night on Thursday,
November 10. The GRC sold far
fewer vouchers for dinners at
local favorites the Sheridan
Livery, Wilson Walker House, and
Sweet Things, despite the event’s
success during Spring Term, when
overmany more people
participated.

“It seemed like everybody went
last year,” said sophomore Jessica
Hopper. “I don’t know anyone
who went this time. I didn’t even
hear about it until this week.”

Though the organization put up
“lots of advertising around
campus and around town,”
according to junior GRC member
Jean Rose Clawater, their publicity
was not enough to convince
students to ditch the books for a
date.

“It was kinda a busy night.
People have work and don’t really
plan on going out on a Thursday,”
said sophomore Jenny Sproul.

Courtney Fitzgerald, senior
and GRC co-chair, planned the
event to make casual dating and
sober interactions between men
and women more prevalent on
campus. She saw Date Night as
providing the opportunity for
W&L students to go out “on an
old-fashioned date.”

“The dating scene here, and at
most other colleges, is very
different from what our parents
and grandparents experienced. We
wanted to bring back dating so that
students would realize that there
are other ways to hang out with
someone of the opposite sex other
than at a party,” said Fitzgerald.

In addition to the ten—dollar
dinner vouchers the GRC sold by
cash, check or swipe, last week’s
event included. a free acoustic
concert in the candlelit Commons
living room, music courtesy of
senior Wheeler Sparks, junior
Blair Crunk, and senior Chris
Kimmel. ‘

“We should have more stuff
like this,” said sophomore Emily
Wolff, who caught the acoustic

‘concert by accident.

Unfortunately, few took
advantage of the dinner vouchers
or the concert opportunity.

“I was planning on going, but
I didn’t get a date,” said
sophomore Abinav Kapur. “ A

While students are rarely roused from the comfort of the frat
basement, SAO’s Casino Night featuring an IM Texas Hold’em
Tournament appealed to the gamblers on campus.
Daring students were willing
to try their luck and show

off their skills.

STAFF WRITER

Victory cries filled the
Marketplace on Wednesday
evening as competitors huddled
together, cards in hand. Disguised
cafeteria tables were draped with
green poker cloths, and music
serenaded students as they
munched on chips and sipped
sodas. Together, the Intramural
committee and the Student
Activities Organization hosted the
first combined Casino Night and
Texas Hold’em tournament.

Though this event was an
attempt to unite IIVI and SAO, the
Hold’em tournament had a much
larger draw. Casino dealer
freshman Jeremy Wainwright said
he thought the Casino Night
would have been much more
popular had it not major
competition from the
tournament. Also,
there were many
f r a t e r n i t y
p a r t i e s
occurring at the
same time.

“We have
many frat guys that
show up,” assistant
casino coordinator
senior Ian Dickinson
said. “We wish we had
more. It’s all a factor of
time, when in the term it is,
and how well it is advertised.”
According to SAO recreation
chair and casino coordinator H.J.
Lee, these organizations aim to
provide students with a sober
environment to socialize and
compete in. Instead of making the
tiring trek to the country, this event
was located conveniently on
campus, easily accessible to
everyone.

“I enjoy it because I get to see

ealing

Casino Night draws students willing to risk it all By Jessica snaw

freshmen and meet new people,”
Lee said. “It’s another way of
meeting people without alcohol.”

SAO sent out a campus notice
advertising spots for poker
dealers. It offered a wage of $40
for three hours, and divided the
students into black jack and
roulette dealers. The four dealers
present were freshman Jeremy
Wainwright, senior Christina
Snowden, freshman Chris Rucker,
and freshman Mike Yan. No
previous experience was required,
but a basic knowledge of the rules
was necessary.

Rucker, Wainwright, and Yan
said their motivation was the
generous paycheck. But, Rucker
claimed he would have
participated regardless of his
dealer position.

“I have friends in SAO,” he
said. “I like to eat, drink, and
converse in brotherly fellowship.”

SAO operates from a budget
from the Executive Committee
and membership fees. This money
was split for pay for the dealers
and the DJ, rent for the supplies,
refreshments, and prizes. The
committee buys the chips too,
even though the students don’t use
real money to play. The SAO
ofﬁcers have weekly meetings to
plan the student events. So far,
attendance has been ﬂuctuating.

“It really varies,” Dickinson
said. “We’re still trying to ﬁgure
out what is the best combination.
We have some things that a lot of
people come to, and some things
where there are just a couple of
friends. We start to see more each
time which is a positive trend.”

Some students attend because
of convenience, and others for the
quality entertainment.

“In comparison, this is hands
down better than frat parties,”
freshman Liza Njuguna said.

“I enjoy it because I get to see freshman
and meet new people. It’s another way of

meeting people without alcohol.”

Lex hosts international directors

Filmmakers from all over the world come to Lexington to debut their films

By Audrey Fell

STAFF WRITER

WorldFest once again visits
Lexington, giving students the
opportunity to learn more about
the film industry. Hosting 16
different directors over the week-
end of November 3"‘, WorldFest
sought to give students a differ-
ent perspective on ﬁlm produc-
tion and screenwriting.

Based out of Houston, Texas,
WorldFest is led by Hunter Todd,
the Chairman and Founding Di-
rector. It is the third oldest in-
ternational film festival in the
county and has discovered fa-
mous directors such as Steven
Spielberg, Ang Lee, the Cohen
brothers, and Rildley Scott.

“This ﬁlm festival is an hon-
ors film festival. That means

only the best of the best are
here,” said Todd. The genres of
ﬁlm vary greatly, from art house
thrillers to conservative docu-
mentaries regarding the Iraq war.

This past weekend, the ﬁlm
festival was hosted in Lexington,
under the personal sponsorship
of John Dean, a Washington and
Lee alumni from the class of
1976.

After seeing the Beatles’
movie “Help”, Dean’s eyes were
open to an entirely different
genre of ﬁlm. From that point on,
Dean aspired to take part in the
ﬁlm industry.

The 16 film directors come
from all parts of the world, in-
cluding 8 different countries.
The directors also vary in age
and experience in ﬁlm creation.
The director’s inspirations for
creating the ﬁlms vary with some
based on personal experience,
some dance, and others on visual
aspects of the landscape por-
trayed in the ﬁlm.

On writing his screenplay,
Flaman found it difﬁcult to ﬁnd
sufficient help to critique his
work. “You can’t have family or
friends critique your work, you
have to find someone that
doesn’t care at all about what you

are writing to get the best re-
view.”

The scenery in Juliet
McKoen’s ﬁhn “Frozen” was the
center for the plot. She based her
script around a lake, which stood
as a symbol throughout the ﬁlm.
“My ﬁlm is thematically inspect-
ing the boundaries between per-
ception and reality.”

Short ﬁlms were also a very
big feature at Worldfest—Lexing-
ton. Each of the short ﬁlms fo-
cused on different types of cin-
ematography; some were car-
toons and others short dramas.

Liz Milwe’s short ﬁlm,“The
Wedding” captures the wedding
between two people through two
different types of dance. “I
wanted to capture my work on
film, because stories and actions
continue to move on through
ﬁlm, rather than being lost for-
ever in a theater production.”
Having worked as a choreogra-
pher, the film gave Milwe the
opportunity to share her art to
more people than would in the
theater.

“Cat’s Bad Hair Day” was
another short film by Debby
Wolfe, a recent graduate of Uni-
versity of Central Florida Film
Program. She used this ﬁlm as
her graduation ﬁlm at the univer-
sity. “The story is a con1ing—of—
age story which is based on my
personal experiences. It realis-
tically shows how young girls
deal with their changes.” In or-
der to ﬁnd the sets for this ﬁlm,
Wolfe took over a middle school
in Orlando as well as went door
to door asking people permission
to use their houses.

The ﬁlms presented gave stu-
dents a large feel for the differ-
ent ways to use their creativity
in new ways. Before kicking off
the festival, John Dean shared his
underlying motive for the ﬁlm
festival. “Through the ﬁlm festi-
val, I hope to show students that
there are other ways to become
successful] aside from being in-
vestment bankers or lawyers.
Finding success is something you
are passionate with is the great-
est way to live your life.”

sure the reputation of male and
female students within the Greek '

pointed out that a promiscuous

ferred to as a “frat—daddy” or
“frat-lord,” while a woman who
engaged in similar behavior

said that she had embraced the
feminist movement less before
she came here. “W&L has
radicalized me, hell yeah,” she
said.

One of the reasons that femi-
nists tend to get a bad rap is that
gender relations on campus are
poor

“Men and women are almost
entirely separate. Their only in-
teraction is on the dance ﬂoor
or at a party where alcohol is in-
volved and men are literally
trawling for women. Students
are forced to objectify members
of the opposite sex,” said sopho-
more Dane Boston.

Another related issue is the
double standard used to mea-

more than ﬁfty people. Those
in attendance included represen-
tatives from all sectors of the
Lexington community, including
professors, fraternity men, VMI
students, and people from the
town. The discussion was mod-
erated by Dean Ellen Mayock.

At the beginning, Dean
Mayock asked everyone who
considered themselves to be
feminists to raise their hands.
Many did, but some did not.

People felt hesitant to raise
their hands since feminism has a
negative connotation, especially
on this campus. Freshman Grace
Andrews said, “You feel that if
you call yourself a feminist, you
have to ﬁt the mold- you have to
be angry and belligerent.”

Others refused to identify
themselves with what they felt
was just another label. Sopho-
more Yvonne Coker said “I don’t
call myself a feminist, because
feminism is another label, and it
becomes a cookie cutter. It is an
approach, an outlook on life, I
don’t use a word.”

women their reproductive
rights,” she said.

This point was heavily de-
bated, since many of the people
present considered themselves
to be supporters of women's
rights, while opposing abortion.

The forum then progressed to

“Feminism is all about choice. You can be a

College years hold big deci-
sions for everyone, but for W&L
women, these decisions are es-
pecially difficult and 1ife-chang-
ing. Every woman on this cam-
pus is capable of making her own
way in the world and engaging
in a lucrative and prestigious ca-
reen

Yet many are torn. The tug
of maternal instincts and the tick
of the biological clock contend
with the pull of success and the
pressure to make money.

As difficult as this decision is,
what women really want is the
ability to make that choice for
themselves and for society to re-
spect and support them in what-
ever path they decide to pursue.
At the most basic level, feminism
stands for choice and respect.

In order to increase awareness
and begin productive dialogue,
sophomore Jessica Hopper orga-
nized a Feminist Forum to dis-
cuss topics relevant to the W&L
community. Hopper worked this
summer as an intern at the

' Rockbridge chapter of the Na-
tional Organization for Women.

“This was necessary to do
because of the gender relations
problem and because thought
here is so homogeneous,” she
said.

connotation, especially on this
campus. Those who espouse
feminist thought are sometimes
viewed as militant and man—hat-
ing.

The forum addressed what
feminism really meant. Sopho-
more Andrew Rothey said,
“Feminism is all about choice.
You can be a feminist home-
maker. You can be a feminist
CEO. You can choose where you
put your talents.”

Professor Domnica
Radulescu believed that femi-
nism had a stricter definition.
“You cannot call yourself a femi-
nist if you deny women her right
to choose. It is a characteristic
of dictatorial societies to deny

Some feel that another word
describes their views better.
“People accept the word equali-
tarian more readily,” said sopho-
more Dominique Lamb.

Professor Robin LeB1anc ex-
pressed disappointment that the
word should have to be used at
all. “I shouldn’t have to use a
special word for the rights ev-
eryone should have regardless of
whether or not they have a pc-
nis,” she said.

The difficulty with deciding
whether or not to label oneself a
feminist stems from an ambiva-
lent deﬁnition of the word. Al-
though feminism literally means
advocacy for rights for women,
the word often has a negative

TALKBACKS

Do you think that the
upcoming Colonnade
renovations are
warranted?

 

Tim Smith, alumni ‘o4 '
“The buildings should, at some
point, be gutted and completely

, modernized for the sake of

keeping up with technology.
But as for the facade, it should
never be touched.”

 

C.J. Joseph-Guevara,
freshman ‘
“The colonnade does need to

be accessible to the handi-
capped, and when a student
gets injured it is a pretty big
hassle to climb four ﬂights of
stairs to get to class. Overall, I
do agree it is something that
needs to be done.”

    
  

Craig Malkmes, freshman
“No, we should not renovate
the Colonnade. Not only is it a
national landmark, the Colon-
nade deﬁnes W&L. It is so
unique and it really captures
the character of the school.”

 
   

. .  vs

Kate Norby, senior
“I think that the only renova-
tions that should be done are to
preserve, like painting or ﬁxing
the foundation. If there were to
be any cosmetic renovations, or
a complete overhaul of a par-
ticular building, I can assure
you that that will not go over
well with alumni or current stu-
dents.”

Adam Kowaisky, junior
“I really like the fact that all
the buildings look alike on the
outside but are vastly different
on the inside. It makes them
look uniform but still gives
them personality. I can see that
the buildings need some work,
but if renovations do take place
I think it would be very impor-
tant to maintain that element of
each building’s uniqueness and
individuality.”

This week’s Talkbacks was

conducted by Ashley Cooning.

COLUM NIST

I have no problem with rela-
tionships, in fact, I am much hap-
pier with my life when involved
with a special someone.

However, the prospect of
finding an awesome chick that
digs me at our school is a fright-
ening scenario.

Ideally I would like to push
marriage until my late 20’s so I
can let my hormones settle be-
fore I am forced to only have sex
with one person for the rest of
my life.

I know that if I marry within
the next ﬁve years, the marriage
will last about as long as Gigli
did in theatres.

Recently I attended a meeting
on feminism in order to gain a
broader and less narrow—rninded
perspective on the women in our
school, and women in general.

Actually, I said that to make
myself sound like a caring per-
son.

I attended because I find it
extremely entertaining when
women talk about their intense
hatred for men.

I expected to walk into a
scene of crazed activists com-
plaining about the degradation
they routinely face due to the evil
stereotypical male.

In spite of the previous sar-
casm, I will admit that I was en-
lightened and my definition of
feminism changed dramatically.

Apparently the modern femi-
nist does not concern themselves
with hating men (I admit I was a
tad disappointed).

Feminism has evolved to long
for more than equality with the
opposite sex.

The contemporary feminist,
as I comprehended after listen-
ing to the consensus of opinions,
desires the right to choose their
path.

l’d delve more into the intri-
cacies of feminism, but that
would be comparable to attempt-
ing to describe the, details of Wilt
Chamber1ain’s love life (he slept
with an estimated 20,000
women).

MAJORING IN
MARRIAGE

Women who would rather wed than work are on to something

@ TOYOTA

The modern woman at W&L
should strive for high—paying
jobs, but the appeal of the M.R.S.
Degree still seems appealing to
many girls at our school.

Although I planned to write
an article talking about how this
sacred degree has led to a loss
of feminism on campus, I will
choose not to insult or critique
the conformists.

In other words, I consider the
people that frown upon the
M.R.S. Degree naive to the mod-
em definition of feminism.

Personally, if I meet a moti-
vated woman that revealed signs
of wanting to marry me, proved
that her dad would provide her
with a stellar job. and guaranteed
that I could relax at home all day
and play with the kids I would
definitely take the M.R. Degree.

That opportunity looks doubt-
ful so I will continue with the
attempt to deceive a fine damsel
into believing that I have a ca-
reer in something promising.

Contemporary feminists
would love to see more women
enter the workforce and pursue
wages equal to those of men

However, they also respect
the women that choose to raise
children at home.

The only problem is that a
majority of the W&L girls who
receive a M.R.S. Degree with a
minor in Business Administra-
tion will neglect to take an ac-
tive role in the feminist move-
ment.

If the M.R.S. Degree were an
actual major at our school, the
classes would be the,Elliptical
101, Stationary Bike 230, and
How to Avoid the Fro-Yo 347.

Although the hallowed degree
is measured in carats as opposed
to GPA, this conformity only
leads to loss of individuality (dif-
ferent from loss in feminism)
which is routine at this school.

Feminists should embrace the
M.R.S. Degree. Besides, any guy
stupid enough to marry at 23 will
be too oblivious to ask his
ﬁancee to sign a pre—nup.

Ladies, I encourage you
marry the right guy because the
M.R.S. Degree can bring the
riches for which you spent hours
studying.
