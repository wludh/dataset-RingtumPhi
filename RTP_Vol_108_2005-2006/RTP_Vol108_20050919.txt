W&L opens doors
to hurricane victims

By Leah Kershaw
and Katelyn Finley

NEWS EDITOR, STAFF WRITER

In the wake of Katrina,
New Orleans students have
scattered in search of a fu-
ture.

When the hurricane hit
New Orleans, sophomore
Kate Chiasson and her
roornates were getting ready
to start the upcoming school
year at Tulane .

“I moved in my furniture
and clothes on a Friday and
left Saturday morning,” said

I Chiasson.

Now, just a few weeks
later, Chiasson and her room-
mates are attending different
schools across the nation.

As for their house, “It’s
under two feet of water and
I’m worried about looting
and mold,” said Chiasson.

Junior Skye Eiswirth,
who learned about W&L’s .
program to offer admission to
Tulane students from a fam-
ily friend, had similar prob-
lems ﬁnding a school.

“A lot of universities are
only taking people from their
states. That was really aggra-

, vating and made it hard to
find a good school,” said
Eiswirth. .

Chiasson, who said she is
glad to be at W&L, was of-
fered admission for fall se-
mester a few days after
faxing in her one~page appli-
cation. I

Participating in the Zeta
Tau chapter of Kappa Kappa
Gamma has helped Chiasson
with the transition, as well as
some of her close friends who
already attend W&L, she
said.

However, Chiasson said
she is excited to go back to
New Orleans even though
“the city isn’t going to be the
same. Jazz Fest and Mardi
Gras won’t happen,” said
Chiasson, “There is a possi-
bility but who knows?”

Eiswirth is optimistic
about both the upcoming

, spring semester at Tulane and
the rebuilding of New Or-
leans.

“A lot of people are go-
ing to have school spirit,”

‘ said Eiswirth, “I think New
Orleans is going to be ‘a lot
better and a lot safer.”

TOP GIRLS

Wiant among first W&L Women

Sally Wiant opens up about her experiences as
one of the very first women to graduate from W&L

By Steph Wiechmann
STAFF WRITER

In 1972, Sally Wiant entered a
foreign world. Not knowing
anyone “east of the Mississippi
River,” she came to Lexington,
Virginia — to a world of men.

Wiant entered the Washington
and Lee School of Law as one of
the six women students admitted
in the fall of 1972 to become the
first women to graduate from the
institution. She, herself, took a
different approach to the typical
three-year course of study.

Then-Dean Roy Steinheimer
brought Wiant here as a junior
professional librarian. They
worked out an agreement that she
would work half the time and
attend classes half the time.

Wiant spent six years in law
school and graduated in 1978.
She has been on the law faculty
ever since.

Being one of the first women
to attend Washington and Lee,
Wiant and her fellow female
students had quite an arrival here
on campus.

Unlike the preparation done
before the implementation of co-
education here in 1985, the law
school was not ready for the new
women students.

“There was no thought given
to where we would live or health
services,” said Wiant. “In fact,

there was so little thought given
to our arrival, that one of the first
things the SBA president.did was
to write a lengthy memo to the
dean of the law school requesting
that he change the faculty men’s
restroom to a ladies’ room.”

The male law students, though,
were quite welcoming.

In the 1970s, a typical law
class would contain about 75
students. Wiant said that it was
“like having that many older
brothers watching out for every
little thing you did.”

Difficulties didn’t show up
until the third class of female
students arrived.

“By then, the newness had
worn off,” Wiant said.

The undergraduate male
students took a different
approach. Tucker Hall was home
to the law school until 1973, so
law students and undergrads saw
each other regularly.

These students were not too
happy about the law class’s
change in composition. But, like
southern gentlemen, they put a
positive spin on the event.

“They felt,” said Wiant, “that
it was the law school and not the
undergraduate student population
that was being invaded.”

The Alumni Office also
presented complications. She
said, “Every time the Alumni
Office would send me

 

“It may be time for us

to seriously consider a
female candidate for the
[university] presidency.

That would be bold, indeed.”

SALLY WIANT, W&L LAW CLASS OF ‘78

information, it was always
addressed to Mr. Sarah Wiant.”
Still, Wiant persevered and has
enjoyed her time here, seeing the
changes that the campus has gone
through. She was present during
the co-education period, when the
undergraduate women did not
have such an easy time as she
herself did only years before.
“We didn’t suffer the barrage
of negative comments as the
undergraduate campus did,” she
said. “[Ours] was much more
subtle.” She did welcome the
changes and likes what has seen
so far.
“The stellar increase in
academics has been remarkable.”
During this year-long
celebration of women at W&L,
Wiant looks back on her time here
and reﬂects how the campus has
changed — and informs us that we
still have a long way to go.
“This is still a very male
campus,” she warns us. “It’s
remarkable that we’ve never had
a permanent female Dean of the

College. It’s remarkable to me
that only this year has the law
school ever had a woman in a
faculty-chaired position. It’s
remarkable to me that we’ve never
had a woman Dean of the law
school or a woman Dean of the
commerce school....

“It seems to me that there are
some very strong women
candidates out there and it may be
the time for the University to
recognize that.

“And,” she adds, “it may be
time for us to seriously consider a
female candidate for the
[university] presidency. That
would be bold, indeed. There
might be the right candidate out
there.”

Wiant was a pioneer when it
came to both female education and
faculty here at our alma mater.
She fought for what she thought
she deserved, and for it received
a place in our history book.

Against all odds, Wiant turned
what was once a man’s world into
her own.

Men’s Soccer shows promise

Team kicks into action with the hopes of coming away withthe QDAC title

By Jacob Geiger
STAFF WRITER

Just three weeks into the 2005
campaign, the men’s soccer team
is makinga habit of taking games
down to the wire.

The first three games were all
decided by one goal, and two went
into double overtime.

Though forward Jack Palmer’s
dramatic golden goal to beat
Catholic 3-2 was offset by a heart-
breaking last second loss to South-
ern Virginia, there’s no doubt that
the Generals are poised for a suc-
cessful season.

Freshman midﬁelder Fletcher
McCraw said the captains “estab-
lish an environment that helps the
team come together.”

The captains emphasized the
team’s goal of winning the
ODAC championship.

' “That’s a pretty unanimous
goal, ” Wallace reported.

“What’s the point of just say-
ing, ‘I hope we win some games

“I don ’t think anyone, especially the seniors,

with the ODAC title.”

will be truly satisﬁed unless we come away

- MATT WALLACE, CLASS OF 2006
 

this year’? I don’t think anyone,
especially the seniors, will be truly
satisfied unless we come away
with the ODAC title.”

While stressing that every con-
ference game is important, senior
Robert Morscheiser acknowl-
edged that “the biggest stretch for
us will be our ﬁnal three games
against Roanoke, Wesleyan and
Lynchburg, who were seeded one,
two, and three respectively in the
preseason polls.”

He also emphasized the team’s
need to “play up to [its] potential
this year. There’s a lot of talent
on this team and there’s no rea-
son we shouldn’t put together a
solid season.”

While Wallace cautioned against
looking ahead on the schedule, he
did admit that, “as usual, the
Roanoke game will deﬁnitely be one
to watch.”

One crucial element of the team’s
success so far has been the hot foot
of sophomore Josh Dodds, who
notched four goals in the ﬁrst three
games. Morscheiser called Dodds
the team’s most improved player
and said he’s been playing “on a first
class level.”

Dodds, who’s making a huge
impact in only his second season,
also leads a group of talented sopho-
mores and freshmen who will lead
the team in future seasons.

McCraw has seen some minutes

at midﬁelder, while Wade Cruser
of Norfolk has occasionally
paired with Dodds at the front of
the W&L attack.

Wallace also mentioned
Tommy Pignatelli, a scrappy 5’4”
forward from Chatham, New Jer-
sey. “He’s quick,” Wallace an-
nounced, “but he needs to grow
about 6 inches and put on 30-40
pounds. Chris Schall will whip
him into shape eventually.”

The captains also talked about
Head Coach Rolf Piranian, a 1974
W&L grad who is in his 30th sea-
son as head coach.

“I don’t think you can argue
with experience,” -Wallace said.
“He’s really old school butkeeps
up with the changing trends in
soccer and new ideas. He loves
good, hard, honest play. Really
blue-collar.”

With Piranian and his son,
Mike, coaching from the bench
and with three great captains on
the ﬁeld, the Generals seem cer-
tain to make some noise in the
ODAC beforethe end of the sea-
son.

Greek Summit: ‘Great’ or just a snoozefest‘?

Attendance was low but intentions were good at this weekend’s forum for Greek improvement

By Sarah Murray
and Rob Armstrong
STAFF WRITERS

Administrators, alurrmi, and
current students met this week-
end to decide the future of the
Greek system.

The Greek summit offered
various speakers a chance to
spotlight both pros and cons of
the current fraternities and so-
rorities.

“We need to take an honest i

look at ourselves and evaluate
our performance,” Jon
Williamson, executive vice
president of the North Ameri-
can Fraternity Conference, said
at Friday’s opening session.
One session, titled “Moving
From Good to Great,” voiced a

theme repeated frequently
throughout the weekend.
Adelaide Ng ‘08, said,
“They’re sending out a good
message for being able to stand
up for what you believe in.”
The highlight of the first night
was a slideshow giving examples
of courage throughout history.
The screen read, “What will it
take for fraternities and sorori-
ties to endure? Courage.”
Familiar imagesof Iraqi citi-
zens in voting booths, Martin
Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks,
President Reagan and Sept. 11
rescue workers were shown.
The theme seemed a bit odd
to Ng, who said some people
may have had problems connect-
ing civil rights heroes with fra-
ternity brothers. Regardless, she

said, “All the people made it a
positive experience:

Saturday’s keynote speaker
David Stollman emphasized the
importance of countering nega-
tive Greek stereotypes as well as
fostering improvement in the
student members of each orga-
nization.

“[Stollman’s] speech really
got the audience’s attention...it
was quite captivating,” said Neal
Schaeffer ‘O8. ,

Saturday’s activities also in-
cluded small discussion groups
on topics such as current prob-
lems with the Greek system, val-
ues of Greek organizations, and
changes that can be made. Se-
nior Elizabeth Eisenbrandt said,
“We have been working within
our Greek organizations for the

past three years and our opinions
and experiences helped inform
the upcoming leaders.”

Eisenbrandt, a co—chair of the
summit, said the discussions of-
fered an opportunity for upper-
classmen to shape the way their
organizations will run after their
graduation.

Not all students were as
thrilled with proceedings.
Schaeffer said, “each session had
a speciﬁc goal, but in the end got
back to the same stuff,” referring
to the repeated “Good to Great’
theme. He called the weekend
“a bit redundant.”

The low attendance later in
the proceedings suggests that
others agreed. At one point in his
speech Saturday night, Stollman,
attempting to recognize mem-

bers of each organization, called
out to Sigma Chi, whose mem-
bers had made an early exit.

Senior Justin Hannon, Presi-
dent of Sigma Chi, said he did
not deny this claim, but declined
further comment.

. In a brief speech Friday, act-
ing President Harlan Beckley
praised students for their hard
work on the summit, mentioning
that Greeks have a “special obli-
gation” to give back to the school
that has given so much to them.

“We’re headed in the right
direction,” said Ng, “the intent

' behind the summit was good.”

After a rocky start against
non-ODAC teams, the‘
Generals Field Hockey
team is ready to charge

into the season.

By Sarah Bloom
STAFF WR|TER

Imagine a first place ranking
in the ODAC, your best season
ever, personally winning the Con-
ference Championship, our best

SCBSOII CV8!" 3S a team, earning 8 .

bid to the NCAA. I hope you can
because I am.

Coach Orrison’s words in
mind, the women’s ﬁeld hockey
team returned to school in early
August for rigorous preseason
doubles and team selection.

With ten new freshmen, the
team must rely not only on fresh
talent, but on the experience of
good returning athletes like senior
captains Jane Beall and Kate
Lester.

The ofﬁcial start of the season
brought frustrating early losses to
non-ODAC teams, Catholic and
Johns Hopkins, calling for a re-
view of basics.

“We just had to practice ﬁnd-
ing each other on the ﬁeld,” said
sophomore Kendall Korte.

The team’s energy and mo-
mentum to have the best season
ever, however, was not lost with
the loss of a few games.

  
Apply t 

“We have great skills, and it is
just going to take some ironing out
to get everyone gelling and on the
same page,” said Beall of the
losses. '

“Those teams are always really
good,” added Korte of Catholic
and Hopkins. “It’s hard because
we start our season so much later
than they do. They have an advan-
tage because they are already 4
games deep when we play them,
but I think our teams are equal.”

Ranked third in the ODAC pre-
season poll, the Generals will need
to turn this year’s play-record
around in order to claim victory
over first and second ranked
Lynchburg and Virginia Wesleyan.

Coach Orrison has conﬁdence
in her team’s ability to do just
that.

In a preseason interview
Orrison stated, “One of my goals
is to be undefeated at home. If we
do, then we will have a great
chance to host the ODAC Cham-
pionship.”

Four-year player and team cap-
tain Jane Beall will be relied
heavily upon for her talent and
experience on offense as the Gen-

erals take on their ODAC rivals.

In the past, Beall has lead the
team in scoring, goals and assists
and already has a school record to
her name for career assists.

“To host the ODAC champi-
onship on the new W&L turf ﬁeld
would be such an advantage,” said
Korte of the chance to play in front
of a home crowd. Most of the
other teams still practice on grass
fields.

On Wednesday, the team will
ﬁnally have the chance to take on
one of their biggest rivals when
they play Lynchburg College.

“We’re going to need to start
finishing our goals to win the
games,” said Korte. “We’re going
to have to realize that we’re not
going to ﬁnd the perfect shot ev-
ery time and that we need to just
be aggressive and go for them
when we’re close.”

Captain Beall agrees: “I want
people to be concerned when they
play us. We need to be a threat,
and I think we can be.”

Beall, like her coach and team-
mates, would like to see the team
not only imagine, but play a per-
fect year.

“I want people to be concerned when
they play us. We need to be a threat,
and I think we can be.”

Described by the cast as “the granddaddy of
sketch comedy, ” Second City’s quirky cast took
a few minutes before their Wednesday show to

answer some questions about who they are,

what they do and how they operate.

By Kate Shellnutt
STAFF WRITER

Who starts in Chicago,
tours all over the country,
and ends up on the stage of
Saturday Night Live?

No need to look to the
back of the joke book for
the answer to this one. The
Second City performed at
the Lenfest Center this
week, bringing one of the
nation’s most famous com-
edy revues to Lexington.

After learning, teaching,
and writing sketch and
improv comedy from Sec-
ond City’s base in Chicago,
the troupe transformed in to
“a big nerdy band,” said

Hans Holsen, Second City
cast member, to travel
around the country and per-
form.

The ﬂexibility of the en-
semble-based show al-
lowed the cast to tailor
their jokes specifically to
the W&L audience.

“We like to localize it
and bring the show there,”
said another cast member,
Dana Quercioli. Jokes in-
volving Traveller, Lexing-
ton, Greek life, and the
nearby University of Vir-
ginia kept students laugh-
ing.

“For a lot of audiences,
this is the first time they’ve
seen a comedy revue, so

it’s pretty much always a
positive response,” she
said.

The show proves con-
sistently funny, but its
improvisational elements
allow for variety in con-
tent.

“Some audiences are
more politically driven,
some catch subtle things,
and some have dirty
minds...,” said Joe
Grazulis, Second City
musical director. “Well,
they pretty much all have
at least that one guy with
the dirty mind.”

With jokes varying
from political to every-
day, satirical to light-
hearted (see sidebar for
examples), the group tip-
toes “the line” of
present-day comedy.

Some pieces, like a
frustrated high school
math teacher or annoying

toddler at the pool, re-
semble characters on Satur-
day Night Live, where most
Second City performers
dream of ending up, and
where most do.

The program’s alumnae
list boasts John Belushi,
Gilda Radner, Dan Akroyd,
Eugene Levy, Bill Murray,
Martin Short, and even cur-
rent SNL cast members
Horatio Sans and Tina Fey.

Other pieces include
music, audience interac-
tion, or even mime to score
audience laughs.

Some jokes, however,
are neither written nor im-
provised.

“I pretty much mess up
every night,” admitted
Quercioli. “But people
think it’s funny, so it kinda
becomes part of the show.”

Improvising keeps audi-
ences laughing, which is re--
ally the ultimate punch line.

Shelly Gossman, and Ryan Archibald

Do they ever mess up?
“Nightly,” Dana said of
herself. “But, yeah, it’s
part of the show.” The au-
dience can deﬁnitely sec-
ond that sentiment, espe-
cially after listening to her
mispronounce “denomina-
tor” four times.

What kind of response
are they used to?

“For a lot of audiences this
is the first time they’ve
seen a comedy revue, so it’
s always a positive re-
sponse.” Dana said.

How do they travel?
While they are on tour, the
troupe drives rental cars,
and flies to more distant lo-

cations like San Diego or
New Mexico.

Where are they from?
The performers Wednesday
all began as theater per-
formers in Chicago, before
studying at the conserva-
tory there.

What do they do when
they’re not touring?
Although the group per-
forms throughout the year,
they do fewer shows during
the summer. During the
time in between, they re-
turn to Chicago, where they
perform, teach classes, and
rehearse 3 times a week.

Pick the punchline.

The term “situational comedy” reminds audiences that
humor comes from just that, a character’s situation at a
particular moment. The comedy revue The Second City
used sketches and songs to demonstrate this humor.

the context in which they were said?

Homecoing
fashion sense

What to wear and what not to wear this weekend

By Eka Akpakip and Bree Melton
STAFF COLUMNISTS

Okay ladies and gents, it’s that
time of year again, andeven earlier
than usual. That’s right, it’s
Homecoming Weekend.

The weekend during which the
alumni return to revel in their days
of yore, the fraternities host some
of the most important nights of
formal recruitment, and great
bands and parties abound across
campus.

But what, oh what, is one to
wear? Certainly this is old hat to
many, but the poor little freshmen,
like so many lost lambs, haven’t a
clue which little black dress is
appropriate.

Boys, let’s face it: coat and tie.
It’s simple, it’s classic, you’ve got
a million in your closet. That’s
your decision because Breka really
just doesn’t have the time to pick
out everyone’s outﬁt!

But Breka also understands
how those of our gender,
especially the younger ones, fret
themselves silly over minute
details such as what to wear. Now
is the time for us to impart our
wisdom as those women who
came before us. Breka will reveal
the mystery of Homecoming
Garb.

So back to‘ the matter at hand:
what is a girl to wear? This is
where that quintessential little
black dress that you bought
because you couldn’t pass up the
sale, but you didn’t know when
you would ever wear it comes in
to play. Now is the time to break
that dress out. . .and hopefully you

have two of them.

Friday night is the slightly
more formal night with dinners,
cocktail parties and alum-
schmoozing. (Get the practice in
now, it’s what you will be doing
for practically the rest of your
adult life!)

The next day kicks off with the
football game against Centre.
This is when it is appropriate to
don those madras and Nantucket
red pants you’ve been itching to
wear, gentlemen.

Ladies, you know what to do:
sundress, cute heels, pearls.
Please, you’ve got this down.

But what about Saturday
night? This is the night that you
go a little less formal.

If you were wearing tea length
the night before, deﬁnitely wear
the cocktail length tonight. That’s
just above the ankle and just
below the knee, respectively.

Saturday night is full of bands
and" running from one fraternity
house to the next. There will be
dinner, cocktails and schmoozing
still, but there’s definitely more
activity on Saturday than there
will be on Friday.

It may even be appropriate to
return to your room and change for
the bands after dinner and
cocktails, but you won’t see Breka
doing that. Oh no, we have
partying in our formal wear down
to an art.

So be safe, have fun, and if you
don’t have a date, go out anyway.
Nothing makes a girl feel like a
million dollars like putting on a
great dress.
