corrections

In our Feb. 27 issue, the
Phi committed a regrettable
error.

The feature “Behind Bars,”
which appears on page 2,
chronicles and pokes fun at
student and community arrests
from the week. The reporter
treks to the police station a
few times a week, copies out
the arrest reports and then
compiles the section.

On this particular week,

a man named William Jef-
fery Moore was arrested and
charged with being drunk in
public and underage posses-
sion of alcohol. The man is
20 years old and a Lexington
resident.

James William Moore, who
attends Washington and Lee, is
19 years old and a Rockbridge
County resident. He is a Phi
Delta Theta pledge, and his
family is well-known in the
Rockbridge County area.

Unfortunately, the reporter
who compiles the police re-
ports knows Will Moore,
and made an assumption that
should not have been made.

The insult was compound-
ed by the jocular nature of the
feature, which has since been
changed to model that of the
“Rockbridge Advocate” and
“Rockbridge Weekly.”

Will Moore, who attends
Washington and Lee, was

over the Washington break.

The Phi both apologizes
to Will and his family, and
retracts the statements released
in our Feb. 27 edition.

Also in our Feb. 27 edition,
Rachael Seidenschnur was
quoted saying that Kenneth
Cribb did not always support
The Spectator during his time
at W&L. The Spectator was
not in publication when Cribb
was a student at W&L. The
Phi regrets the error.

Spring term absenc

Possible proposals include early graduation for
seniors or no Spring term for freshmen students

By Sarah Kientz
surr wnnzn

Changes to the academic
requirements of Spring term
could be coming soon, and one
potential proposal might change
the number of Spring terms
students spend on campus.

According to Provost
Thomas Williams, changes

« will be proposed to alter the

academic requirements of Spring
term. Also, students will not be
permitted to remain on campus
for all four Spring terms.

Despite the rumors that
administrators will be eliminating
Spring term altogether, Williams
said that after three years of
discussion, only a few changes
will be proposed.

One change is that students
will be required to take a 
of six credits. Currently students
are only required to have a three-
credit course load.

Dean Hank Dobin said the
changes will be made in order to
“preserve and enhance the ﬂavor
of spring term” on an academic
level. - ‘

“We’re fully committed to
keeping Spring term, but we
want to enhance it and make it
more academically rigorous,”
Dobin said. “There are proposals
to require students to take six

credits instead of the current
minimum of three.”

With students taking more
courses, Williams said that
already overloaded faculty will
need to teach more classes.

“We want to keep class size
the same, and change the faculty
teaching load to six courses, as it
had been seven,” Williams said.

Students taking more classes
and professors teaching fewer
classes present a problem,
Williams said.

Twenty—one new
undergraduate professors have
already been hired to make up for
the difference, Williams said.

However, another change that
will be made in order to ensure
students can take six credits each
Spring term is that students will
only be allowed to attend three
out of their four Spring terms,
Dobin said.

Williams said there are three
options that administrators are
still considering concerning this
issue.

One is that freshmen will
be asked to leave during their

Spring term. Another is that
seniors will graduate in April,
which, Williams said, “will be
early for the Washington and
Lee calendar, but near the same
time as many other schools.” The
third option is to give students
the choice.

Sophomore Lauren Ottaway
does not find the proposed
changes a positive idea.

“During the spring, courses
require more work and class
time,” Ottaway said. “The option
of one class should be available
if one is taking a difficult class
they want to be able to focus on
more.”

Ottaway also said that
requiring students to leave
campus for one of their Spring
terms has more drawbacks than
beneﬁts.

“I think it would be a good
idea to encourage more people
to go abroad or do internships
off campus during Spring term,”
Ottaway said, “but if you make
people go abroad during the
spring, it will discourage them
from doing programs outside

of W&L, since our schedule is
different, or going abroad for
a full semester in the fall or
winter.”

Ottaway also questioned what
effect the new policy would have
on spring athletes, tuition and
room and board, which are paid
jointly for winter and spring.

Freshman Laura King also
disagreed with the idea of leaving
for one of her future Spring
terms.

“If I’m going to be pre-
med I can’t go abroad during
a Spring term,” King said. “I
don’t understand what students
would do if they didn’t want to
go abroad or if their major forced
them to take classes during all
four spring terms.”

Ottaway said some students
might just enjoy Spring term and
not want to miss out on one.

“There are many people who
don’t want to leave campus for a
term, and I don’t think the school
should force them to.”

Williams also said that W&L’s
unique calendar is one reason
administrators are trying to retain
it. He said administrators have
been discussing possible changes
or even elimination of spring
term for about three years.

“Faculty was nearly split

“Spring term is so unique to this school that I don ’t think we
should be forced to leave for it. ”

LAURA KING, Class of 2009

 

50/50 on retaining the 12-l2-6
calendar and adopting a more
traditional semester calendar,”
Williams said. “A slight majority
preferred our current calendar
over using semesters.”

The unique opportunities that
students have during Spring term
are one reason why Williams
said the faculty chose to keep
it.

“The things that go on
during Spring term, such as
abroad programs and trips
by departments to different
locations around the world,
cannot be done in the long term
because you can’t take students
off campus when they have three
other classes,” Williams said.
“Alumni that have graduated
since 1971 [when the 12-12-6
calendar was adopted] have
loved it and are large supporters
of it.” A

King agreed that Spring term
is a unique experience, and
stressed that as the reason why
some students might not want to
leave during the spring.

“I’d rather go abroad or do
internships during the summer
than lose any time here,” King
said. “Spring term is so unique
to this school that I don’t think
we should be forced to leave
for it.”

Dobin said the proposed
changes are still being discussed
by the Courses and Degrees
committee and will go in front
of the faculty in April.

Core requirements cut back

Faculty approves reductions to literature, social sciences and humanities requirements without debate

ByJacob Geiger
N 2 w 5 £0 I T o n

The undergraduate faculty has
approved signiﬁcant changes to
Washington and Lee’s General
Education requirements and has
scheduled these changes to take
effect in the fall of 2007.

The new requirements will re-
quire one fewer literature course,
one fewer social sciences course
— drawing from economics, poli-
tics, psychology and anthropol-
ogy — and one fewer course from
the humanities - history, religion,
philosophy and ﬁne arts.

Whereas the current system
require two literature courses and
four humanities courses, the new
plan will require students to take
one course each from literature,
ﬁne arts and the other humanities
and then pick a fourth course
from any of those three groups.
The previous requirements had
students take 18 hours of classes
in literature and the humanities;
the current system requires only
12 hours.

These changes come not
long after a decision to reduce
the number of hours needed for
graduation from 121 to 115.

Though several faculty mem-
bers were interested in discuss-
ing the proposal at the faculty
meeting on Mon., Feb. 20, Mark
Rush moved for an immediate
vote and was supported by a
sufficient majority to circumvent
any debate and move straight to
a decision.

“The proposal was approved,
but the manner of anoroval was

unfortunate,” said History De-
partment Chairman Holt Mer-
chant. “We assumed there would
be a long debate but there was no
debate whatsoever.”

History professor Richard
Bidlack, who opposed the pro-
posal, argued that the reductions
are too large.

“In the new curriculum, the
number of credits for graduation
has been cut by six credits, that
is, from 121 to 115. Ifthe cuts in
Gen Ed were proportional, Gen
Ed would be reduced by three
credits because Gen Ed currently
comprises somewhat less that
half of the total curriculum. The
Gen Ed requirement, however,
was cut by nine credits.”

Both Merchant and Bidlack
speculated on how the changes
would affect the school’s liberal
arts experience; Merchant said
that nobody knows that the prac-
tical ramiﬁcations of the changes
will be.

“Students could graduate
from W&L without ever having
taken a course in history, philoso-
phy or religion,” Bidlack said.
“With such a weak humanities
requirement, it is legitimate to
ask whether we are really justi-
ﬁed in calling W&L a liberal arts
university.”

~ Merchant said the ne_w re-
quirements would allow students
to take more electives.

“Right now pre-meds have
almost no wiggle room at all,”
he said.

Dean of the College Hank
Dobin, who joined the adminis-
tration this vear from Princeton

University, said the proposed
changes came from two faculty
committees that were designated
three years ago to make recom-
mendations on the subject.

Dobin also said that most of
the proposals were already for-
mulated when they reached the
Courses and Degrees committee
for ﬁnal review. He said that he
does not think the changes will
alter W&L’s liberal arts experi-
ence.

“We require more
courses than other
schools, so I ’m con-
ﬁdent there is still a
substantive liberal

arts component to

W&L. ”

ART GOLDSMITH
Economics Professor

“The decision to cut total
credits is a complicated story,”
Dobin said. “lt’s a combination
of reducing the teaching load for
faculty combined with a deci-
sion three years ago to maintain
the current academic calendar.
The Board of Trustees has also
approved the hiring of 21 new
faculty.”

Economics professor Art
Goldsmith said the changes will
not be dramatic, but he suggested
other possible alternatives.

“The departments were also
asked to look at the size of their
majors so not all [of the] reduc-
tions would come out of Gen
Ed, but that wasn’t part of the
proposal sent onto the faculty,”
Goldsmith said.

“It’s unfortunate we didn’t
look at that issue more closely;
smaller majors would have al-
lowed, maybe, a freshman semi-
nar, something that a lot of our
peer institutions have tried with
great success.”

Bidlack suggested that offer-
ing minors might help reduce
the course load crunch that many
students face.

Since minors require fewer
courses than a second major,
students could still study in a
second area of interest while still
retaining the ﬂexibility to take
more elective classes.

Merchant said that he does not
think the changes will hurt his
department in the long run.

“We have lots of students now,
and we’ll have lots of students
forever. People study history
because they love it, not because
of Gen Ed requirements.”

Goldsmith, like Dean Dobin,
said he thinks W&L’s liberal
arts identity will be largely un-
affected.

“We require more courses
than other schools, so I’m con-
ﬁdent there is still a substantive
liberal arts component to W&L,”
said Goldsmith.

Though he said that the new
changes will not be dramatic,
Goldsmith still wishes some of
the other ideas could have been

MARCH 6, 2006

 

 

By Katherine Greene
EDlTOR-IN-CHIEF

In a wave of controversy, As-
sociate Dean Ellen Mayock an-
nounced she would resign a year
early.

According to the memo sent
by Dean Hank Dobin to faculty
and staff members on Tuesday,
Feb. 28, Mayock decided to leave
her position, “to return full-time
to teaching and research.”

The memo also suggested that
some problems with Mayock’s
contract may have prompted the
resignation.

“I was simply asking them to

BA RS

put into writing what I under-
stood to be the original terms of
my contract,” she said.

Dobin’s memo said, “the
University has agreed to honor
all the terms of her compensa-
tion.”

As Mayock had previously
understood her contract, she
said, the normal length of a term
would be three years.

But she said that in the de-
bate which lasted several weeks,
there was some “turmoil.”

“I was offered the ﬂexibility
to step down,” she said.

Dobin declined to comment
on the situation, and interim

President Beckley referred only
to Dobin’s memo.

One student said she found
something wrong with the treat-
ment of the only female academic
dean.

Paton Hughes has begun a pe-
tition with her friends and other
concerned students to show a pro-
test of the treatment of women in
the administration.

“We ﬁnd it incredible that
the administration can’t ﬁnd and
maintain a woman,” she said.

Hughes’s group intends to
meet Tuesday to discuss a pos-
sible “silence protest,” which
involves placing duct tape over

idea that women on campus are
being silenced.

Mayock said she has nothing
to do with the women organizing
the protest.

“I wouldn’t directly encourage
anyone to act on my behalf,” she
said.

Mayock also suggested that
her teachings of “activism, as well
as forthrightness, candor, and car-
ing for other human beings,” may
have spurred the support from the
students.

Hughes said, “She deals with a

A campus known for its long military tradition

fails to recognize the service of alumni veterans

and staff members now working for the school.

By Jessica Shaw
nrponrrn

When Director of Public Safe-
ty Mike Young turned 21, it was
no ordinary day.

He spent it in Vietnam.

When a Washington and Lee
student turns 21, it is a big deal--
a night at the Palms, a celebration
with friends, a license to drink
alcohol legally. This is a typical
night for coming of age.

What many do not know, is
that numerous faculty and staff
at this school never experienced
a celebration for their twenty-ﬁrst
birthday. Known or unknown,
Vietnam and Korean War veter-
ans reside among students on this
campus. These heroes want des-
perately for students to attain an
appreciation for their freedom.

“Students generally are into
their own lives,” Young said.
“They forget the reason they have
that life.”

Young served in the military
from 1966-1969. He now co-co-

ordinates Veteran’s Day ceremo-
nies with Vietnam veteran Tim
Kolly to recognize and remem-
ber all who served. He said this
also honors those who did not
receive gratitude at the time.

“If you’ve studied any his-
tory about the Vietnam War,
there was a lot of protest. A lot
of people opted out of service by
staying in school. A lot of people
that I knew in the ’50’s and ’60’s
were protesting the war while I
was ﬁghting it.”

Because of the ﬁerce oppo-
sition to the war, soldiers were
treated poorly upon their return
to America.

“They would treat you like
you were less than dirt,” Young
said. “It got to the point where I
wouldn’t tell anyone I was a Viet-
nam veteran.”

He emphasized that the sol-
diers representing this country
must be respected.

So far, Veteran’s Day ceremo-
nies have been small, consisting
only of a few law students, fac-
ulty and staff members. Young
said they would love to see more
participation.

According EC President Char-
lie Yates, many students are un-
aware of alumni, faculty and staff
involvement overseas.

“Its hard without being per-
sonally connected,” he said.
“We’re so prosperous as a nation,
that it’s easy to lose sight of the
sacriﬁces some people make.”

There are currently ten W&L
students involved in the ROTC
program at Virginia Military Insti-

ROTC, so its not a thing [students] have to

deal with a lot. ”

tute. According to freshman Sean
McKinley, the level of awareness
on this campus is minimal.

“There [are not] a lot of stu-
dents that are in ROTC, so it’s
not a thing [students] have to deal
with a lot,” McKinley said. “It’s
not a normal part of Washington
and Lee discussion. They are in-
terested in their own lives and
school, but students [need] to be
more aware of what their peers
outside of W&L are doing.”

Yates suggested a plan to have
veterans and alumni speak to the
student body as a method to in-
crease campus knowledge.

“A lot of W&L students would
be interested to know what alums
are serving in Iraq and Afghani-
stan,” Yates said. “What you
don’t want to do is accuse people
of being ignorant. Once they are
aware, they will pay attention.”

Young agreed that student
awareness is a step in the right
direction.

“I would like every student to
know what this is all about so that
they would have a gauge of what
kids their age went through at the
same time,” he said. “It’s alien to
a lot of people here what service
to this country means. The rea-
son this country is the way it is,
is because people have died and
served.”

accused of extreme liberalism in

“She took a lot of hits from

both alumni and students,”
Hughes said.
Mayock calls herself a politi-

cal moderate, and said she is sur-
prised at her role as a “beacon of
the left.”

Several rumors have circulat-
ed about campus that Mayock’s
controversial politics may have

But Mayock points to the

confusion over the terms of her
contract.

help in learning the ways of the
school.

Robbery
spree comes
to an end

Police arrest man visiting
Lexington for funeral

By Jacob Geiger
u 2 w s so I r o R

Lexington police re-
cently found a suspect in
a short, intense string of
robberies.

Greggory Coffey of
Portsmouth, Virginia was
arrested and charged after
a ﬁve~day robbery spree
that included numerous
break-ins into both homes
and vehicles.

Police Chief Bruce
Beard says his depart-
ment thinks Coffey was
in town from about Sun.,
Feb. 19 until Thur., Feb.
23, when he was arrested
by Sgt. Miller of the Lex-
ington police force.

“We think he was
here to attend his grand-
mother’s funeral,” Beard
said.

As of Feb. 28, the
city of Lexington was
charging Coffey with six
counts of grand larceny,
one count of burglary
and a charge of posses-
sion of a firearm by a
felon. Miller added that
Coffey also faces four
more felony charges in
the county.

“I’ve got three more

charges I could add on-

but haven’t yet,” Miller
said. “He’s already on
probation from another
felony so he’s got an
automatic ﬁve years for
the gun charge.”
According to Miller,
the burglar’s methods
were simple yet smart.
“He’d go up and try
a door, and if it was un-
locked he’d just slipin.

People saw him, but he I

would’ve just looked like
another contractor doing
work on a house,” Miller
said. “He did everything
in broad daylight.”

The burglar would
also sit in people’s cars
while going through their
belongings. Beard says

that the accused thief
only had to break into
two locked houses and '
one car; everything else,
including, Beard said, the
residence of a Washing-
ton and Lee law student,
was already unlocked.

Miller stressed that

students and other resi-
dents need to look their
doors.
I ' “Please emphasize to
the students how im-
portant it is to lock your
door,” Miller said.

Coffey’s arrest came
about in an unusual
manner. According to
Miller, W&L campus
security saw Coffey cut-
ting through campus on
Feb. 23.

Obtaining a partial
license plate number, the
security officer called
the police, who began
searching Lexington for
the car.

After failing to find a
matching tag in the city,
police expanded their‘
search outside the city
limits. -
“Eventually,” Mill-
er said, “we found the
truck at the Comfort Inn,
and it was full of stuff.
We weren’t originally
suspecting him of the
robberies,‘but when we
asked the owner of the
truck — Coffey’s mother
~— to come look at all the ‘
stuff she said she didn’t
know anything about
it.”

At that point, around
12:30 pm., Miller ar-
rested Coffey.

Though the police de-
partment is working to
return theistoien items,
most have already been
returned. Miller is inves-

I tigating whether Coifey

was involved with other *
recent robberies that have

not been solved. The to-

tal value of the items sto- _ .
len is currently estiniated _

at around $8,000.

Depth key to wins

UConn looking to gain second championship in three years

ByThomas Gift
srrrr warren

This year’s UConn team is
neither the most talented nor the
most skilled group of players that
Jim Calhoun has ever assembled
in Storrs, Connecticut. The 1999
team of Richard “Rip” Hamilton,
Khalid ElAmin, and Ricky Moore
certainly possessed more talent.
The 2004 team of Ben Gordon,
Emeka Okafor, and Taliek Brown
possessed more skill. And yet,
there still exists very little doubt
that the Huskies will be cutting
down the nets at the RCA Dome
in Indianapolis come April 3"’.

The reason? UConn’s depth.
Although plenty of teams can
equal the talent and skill of UCo-
nn’s starting ﬁve, no one comes
close to matching the ﬁrepower of
their bench. Calhoun has a seem-
ingly unlimited string of players
at his disposal when the game is
on the line. In fact, nearly every
player on UConn’s bench would
be guaranteed a starting position

at another Division I school — in-
cluding the likes of Duke, Mem-
phis, Villanova, and Gonzaga.
For example, senior Denham
Brown, who once scored lll
points in a high-school contest
and is averaging 9.4 points per
game this year, has turned out to
be one of UConn’s most clutch
scorers. His last second-shot to
win the Maui Invitational secured
an early-season championship for
the Huskies, and set the tone for a
season of dazzling offensive play.
Additionally, senior Hilton
Armstrong, who did not even
make UConn’s starting ﬁve at the
beginning of the year, is now be-
ing considered a legitimate ﬁrst-
round NBA draft pick. His 10.0
points and 6.8 rebounds per game
have proved valuable when the
Huskies have squared off against
teams with strong front courts.
Finally, ﬁfth-year senior Ed
Nelson, who was named ACC
Rookie of the Year at Georgia
Tech before transferring to UConn
in 2002, has been the emotional
leader for Calhoun’s squad. The

.M3¥¥'W3Sl1l0Q¥0nr College Intercollegiate at Wilson
3 p.m. Country Club in Wilson, NC.
The ﬁrst half of their season
took place in the fall.

The team competed in four
tournaments, ﬁnishing ﬁrst out of
12 teams at the Virginia State In-
tercollegiate Championship.

At the end of last season, the
team was ranked thirteenth in the
nation.

On Feb. 9, the ODAC picked
the team to ﬁnish third of nine
teams in the league. '

The team will face tough com-
petition if they -wish to earn the
ODAC title this year.

Guilford returns as defending
national champions this season,
and Randolph-Macon won the
ODAC title last year.

Ted Williams, captain of the

team, is optimistic and said the
team does believe they are capa-
ble of being ODAC champs.

“We have some talented fresh-
men and sophomores and some
craﬂy veteran players,” he said.

Williams credits their success
to hard work during their season
and even harder workouts in the
gym during the off-season.

The team’s only home touma-
ment, the W&L Buck Leslie Invi-
tational, will be held at the Lex-
ington Golf and Country Club on
Apr. 17-18,

The tournament usually draws
around 50 spectators per day.

It might be because “golfers
normally are good-looking nice
guys who women are attracted
to,” said to Williams. “Our fan
base is wide and good looking.”

The golf team has a lot going
for them with their good looks,
handsome fans and extraordinary
talent.

Look for them to accomplish
great things this spring season.

contributions that Nelson brings
to UConn through his physical

on-the-court play and intense off-
the-court personality cannot be
quantiﬁed into numbers. When
go—to-players Rudy Gay, Marcus
Williams, and Josh Boone are
having off-nights, it is always
Nelson who seems to pick up the
slack for the Huskies.

Ranked number two in both
the AP Poll and the ESPN/USA
Today Coaches’ Poll, the Huskies
are one of the favorites to win
this year’s NCAA Championship.
They’ve also already clinched the
ﬁrst seed and a ﬁrst-round bye in
the Big East Conference touma-
ment this week.

But Calhoun’s words reﬂect
those of a seasoned veteran who
refuses to let hype overshadow
UConn’s ultimate goal: “It’s al-
ways good to be number one in
anything, but it’s not great at this
time of year. I want it at the begin-
ning of April.”

Fortunately for Calhoun, his
team’s depth should be enough to
give him just what he wants.

“Nearly every player on UConn is bench would be guaran-

teed a starting position at another Division I school. ”

Poised to dominate ODACS

Despite losses, men is tennis looks to win 11th straight title

ByMikeFahey
STAFF WRITER

Records can often be
deceiving, as 5-4 would
not appear to be the record
of the ODAC leader and
perennial champion.

However, in the case
of the Washington and
Lee men’s tennis team,
records are deceiving, and
the team, ranked eleventh
nationally, has had many
difficult matches at the
start of their season. While
playing both Division I
and nationally- ranked Di-
vision III teams, the Gen-
erals have had a slow start
to their spring season.

With more conference
play in the near future,
the team is expected to
continue with its winning
traditions.

As sophomore Nat Es-
tes said, “I’d say the team
has started oﬂ° a little slow,
with some injuries affect-
ing the process, but things
are coming along.”

The team has been on

Eichenberger has

been

a winning record lately, as
sophomore Nelson Bunn
was recently named ODAC
Player of the Week. Bunn
had a great week, leading
the Generals in singles and
doubles in wins over Vir-
ginia Wesleyan and Emory
and Henry. ’

Leading the way for
W&L has also been cap-
tains David Shay and
Charles Anderson.

As Bunn said, “The
team has had great lead-
ership this year with two
seniors as our captains.
Every member of the
team helps carry the team
as a whole in each of our
matches.”

Also playing large roles
for the Generals in the top
singles and doubles spots
have been senior Jordan
Eichenberger, junior Jon
Malooly and sophomore
Seth Feibelman. Malooly
has been a strong com-
petitor, playing one of the
top singles spots, while

dominant at both singles and
doubles. Feibelman has had
great results playing both
singles and doubles. Estes
came back from a rough
injury during last season to
have a strong spring. He’s
been a force for the Gener-
als, playing both singles and
doubles.

As the season approach-
es the midway mark, Bunn
is conﬁdent in its ability.
He said, “I feel that every-
one on the team has indi-
vidual things that they need
to work on, but with a little
extra etfort and hard work,
the season should be very
successful, hopeﬁrlly cul-
minating in another ODAC
championship and a bid to
the NCAA toumey.”

Estes talked about an
upcoming battle with Cam-
egie Mellon as well as an-
other match against Mary
Washington as those that
will truly test the squad.
He said, “We really want to
beat [them].”

MONDAY,

 

Disco inferno

The lights, the music, the drama...Fancy Dress always promises to be a high-

proﬁle night. Here are some of the fashion highlights of the party of the year

THE LOOK LIT

By Katherine Greene / Photos by Emily Hulen

Sequins and glitter seemed to be a
common theme all night. Sopho-
more Polly Smith chose a beautiful
'20s-inspired knee-length dress with
splash sequins and sheer, dangling
fabric accents. The low neckline is set
off nicely with the thicker shoulder
straps.

Everyone was talking about Diana
Bur ess’s gorgeous champa ne-col-
ore ﬂoor—len th gown by t e end

of the ni ht. e sequintpatterns ac-
cent her ovelyﬁ ure an accentuate
the neckline, an the petals on the
bottom made it soft and feminine,
with an almost Victorian feel.

 

Choosing a simple wrap pattern, Di-
ana Dozier ca tured a ittle bit of the
'70s feel with er gold sequins.The
em ire waist kee s the dress trendy,
an she sets it o well with a delicate
pair ofshiny hee|s.The halter top of
the dress makes it a little casual, but
she wears it well.

99 YEARS IN THE MAKING
The evolution of Fancy Dress

By Kate Shellnutt
STA FF W RITER

Over the years, many ques-
tions have been asked about the
school’s Fancy Dress Ball.

One of them includes, “What
would Stonewall Jackson think
of the youth of Lexington danc-
ing to licentious German or
disgusting racket?” (asked by an
early observer).

That’s not the question this
article is going to answer.

Because Fancy Dress’ ap-
peal comes from its over-the—top
nature-—the large budget, school-
wide attendance, elaborate deco-
rations, and ﬂashy theme--this ar-
ticle will respond to the question:
has Fancy Dress always been this
way? Is the tradition of Fancy
Dress one of extravagance?

According to the Ring-tum
Phi, the ﬁrst annual Fancy Dress
Ball could only boast “30 cou-
ples and quite a number of stags,

all in fancy dress costumes” in
attendance on Feb. 12, 1907.

Through the ’80s, Fancy
Dress was held on weekday
nights. The ﬁrst Fancy Dress Ball
was held on a Tuesday. ‘

Despite the small crowd and
only $42 budget, the acclaimed
Fancy Dress founder librarian
Annie Jo White hung evergreens,
Japanese lanterns and mural
draperies, "threw confetti and
hired the Virginia Military Insti-
tute orchestra to perform.

The next day, students in the
whole state of Virginia were call-
ing it “the most brilliant event of
the season.”

Once Fancy Dress became an
established tradition in 1913, its
attendance rose. Female students
from neighboring schools would
hope to get “the Bid” to come to
Washington and Lee’s midwinter
dance.

W&L fraternities would have
parties the weekends prior to ﬁnd

dates, not unlike the Pink Palace
parties of recent years.

When Fancy Dress was a
ﬁgure dance, “Home Sweet
Home” would be played at 2 a.m.
to signal the dance’s end. The
song’s lyrics remind listeners of
what seems to be the opposite of
Fancy Dress extravagance-—the
simple life.

A 1972 issue of the Phi
warned readers of the problems
caused by student drinking at the
dance. It reads, “Anyone...seen at
the ball with any kind of drink or
bottle other than the beer being
so1d...will be removed from his
bottle, removed from the dance
or both.”

Co-education brought women
to the school for the 1986 Fancy
Dress Ball, but instead of taking
advantage of the 13:1 male to fe-
male ratio, most female students
asked Hampton-Sydney or Uni-
versity of Virginia boys as dates.

That year, the budget reached

$65,000.

, As an aside——perhaps the
$35/couple tickets were a little
pricey that year. An advertise-
ment from White Front Grocery
markets sale-priced Pabst Blue
Ribbon, New York strip, Rich-
food soda and Pringles Cheez-
Urns as their “Fancy Dress
Special.”

Attendance peaked with
3,500 ball-goers in both 1977
and 1991.

The event’s planners have
built the appeal of Fancy Dress
with performers and decorations:
camels, llamas, belly dancers,
fortune tellers, carousel horses
and authentic reenactments.

This year’s “big element,”
according to Fancy Dress com-
mittee member Stephanie Jordon,
was the light-up dance ﬂoor.

She said students can “expect
a lot more” for next year’s one
hundredth Fancy Dress celebra-
tion.

    

One of the few bold ones to adhere to the
"Studio 54”theme, 'unior Michele Theroux
borrowed a dress t at knows disco--her

mother's prom dress from 1978.

F LASHBACK

“My sophomore year, the theme was Willy
Wonka. That was the ﬁrst FD that my husband,
Adam, and I had been dating-, and it was the

most fun I had ever had at a formal. ”

“The decorations were also really fun because
people starting taking them apart and playing
with them. Adam and I played mini kickball for

a little while with
a gumdrop. ”

“We wore Chuck
Taylors, which

OIIIIIIOIIS

 

I editor

J-school responds
to broadcast mailer

To the Editor:

We in the Journalism Depart-
ment would like to respond to the
campus-wide message sent out
Wednesday criticizing a feature
that has been running on page 2
of the Ring-tum Phi for several
weeks now. The Department of
Journalism and Mass Communi-
cations has no connection with
the Phi nor with any student pub-
lication. Like our Honor system,
these publications are run by stu-
dents, and mainly for students,
a W&L tradition that fits this
university’s deep commitment
to individual responsibility and
trust. But, while the journalism
professors keep our distance, we
think the message sent out to the
entire community on Wednesday
reﬂects several misunderstand-
ings that need to be addressed.

First of all, the Phi does n_ot
have “the right to print whatever it
pleases.” Newspapers, even inde-
pendent student newspapers, are
bound by all sorts of constraints,
from the role and responsibility
of journalists as the information
providers in a free society, to
standards of accuracy and fair-
ness, to legal constraints includ-
ing libel law. Those constraints
serve both to give journalists a
template against which to mea-
sure their own performance and
to ensure the free ﬂow of infor-
mation that is critical to empow-
ering citizens.

That makes another assertion
in the statement particularly curi-

ous — that a matter of public re-
cord and reader interest -- police
incident reports involving W&L
students -- ought to be with-
held from a student newspaper
because they cause unnecessary
distress for the students who have
been charged. Is W&L really this
set apart? If there is to be any
zone of “public life” on an other-
wise insulated campus, we would
think this would be it — arrest
records. The names of arrested
persons routinely appear in com-
munity newspapers across the
nation. Is it a violation of W&L’s
standards of civility and respect
for such information to appear
as well in a campus newspaper?
This, it seems to us, is suggesting
that j oumalism itself is a violation
of W&L’s “keep it in the family”
culture. It’s an interesting point
of view, but we disagree. If the
Phi editors’ primary criterion for
deciding what should be reported
is whether some might ﬁnd the
reporting uncivil, then the W&L
community will be poorly served
by its student media, and that
community will ultimately suf-
fer.

This is not to defend the way
that the Phi has laced the police
shorts with catty commentary.
Such commentary would never
appear in a mainstream news-
paper. It is for the Phi to learn
what is appropriate for student
journalism. Certainly, cattiness
is a feature of many a campus
newspaper, but the combination

in “Behind Bars” perhaps needs
revisiting. That is a matter for the

' student staff, not Reid Hall.

The Phi printed a noxious er-
ror this week, mistaking someone
who had been arrested for a W&L
student. Errors of fact ought to
be acknowledged, apologized
for and corrected, as the Phi has
done. Errors and misjudgments
are committed by all news out-
lets, including student media, but
we don’t believe that that justiﬁes
favoring a civil community over
an informed one.

Student questions Phi’s intent

To the Editor:

I do not understand the point
of the Phi ’s section where you ex-
pose all the crimes that W&L stu-
dents to the community and their
parents. The current issue of you
publicly accusing someone of
falsely committing a crime aside,
this section makes public very
negative and sometimes sensitive
information about our students
and casts thepaper and university

in college, the consequences of
which are more than visited upon
them by the Lexington police.
What are you really achieving by
informing the entire student body
and the alumni community about
some of our student body’s trans-
gressions? I’m sure you have
some justiﬁcation, but I think you
would be wise to consider how
this section appears to the stu-
dents, and the image it creates of

would be much better served by
an intelligent editorial or other-
wise inforrnative article in the
place of the police beat, which is
essentially tattle-taling. Let the
local newspapers spend their time
chronicling all the little problems
that our students get into, as the
paper of a respected academic in-
stitution, spend your time writing
substance of academic merit.
