IFC, Panhel make progress

Board impressed with headway that students have made in the alcohol policy

By Katherine Shell

ASSISTANT NEWS EDITOR

On May 6, Vishal Sapra ’06 and
Karlyn Gold ’06, heads of IFC and Panhel,
respectively, met with the Board of
Trustees. “The primary focus was to
update the Campus Life Committee on the
Gap Analysis,” says Gold. The Gap
Analysis resulted after a charge from the
Board to “find the ‘gaps’ between risk
management policy and actual practice on
this campus.” Both Sapra and Gold
presented PowerPoints related to the
current progress made towards
actualization of Greek national policies.

Gold concluded her presentation
with a “Vision for the Future” slide that
promoted a Stronger Panhellenic Spirit,
Extension, Reviewing of Risk
Management Policies, Cooperation with
IFC, and Greek Summit and Leadership
Retreat in early Fall. Several of these are
currently in place, with the process of
Extension beginning next week.

return for

By Shelley Orman

STAFF WRITER "" "

Washington and Lee’s alumni will
assemble back at school this Thursday
through Saturday for the school’s annual
Reunion ,Weekend.

The reunion will commence
Thursday evening with an assembly in Lee
Chapel, where President Burish will
deliver the keynote address. The ODK
Spring Initiation will also take place at this
assembly.

Classes in attendance will be those
who graduated in years ending in zero and
ﬁve, starting with the class of 1955 and
ending with the class of 2000. Every year
the Alumni Ofﬁce chooses two classes to
honor. This year the school will honor the
25“‘ reunion of the class of 1980 and the
50”‘ reunion of the class of 1955. While
the weekend’s events are focused on this
year’s speciﬁc reunion classes, all alumni
are invited to attend.

The Alumni House is expecting
over 1500 alumni to attend this weekend,
according to Jill Straub the office’s
administrative assistant. “We’ve been
booked for over a month,” she said.

The Alumni House takes care of all
the weekend’s details by arranging meals,
lodging, and transportation to and from all
of the events. They have reserved rooms

with all of the surrounding hotels and _

encourage alurrmi to stay with their fellow
classmates by designating speciﬁc hotels
for each class.

The Alumni Office and several
departments and organizations have
scheduled a variety of activities for alumni.
“We’ve arranged a combination of fun
things to do here in Lexington,” Straub
said.

Among the many activities that
alumni will have the opportunity to
participate in are taking a campus tour,
going on a hike, listening to presentations
given by current students, faculty and
alumni, and attending department’s open
houses and receptions.

Alumni are also encouraged to
participate in the current Strategic
Planning process. They are invited to
attend two sessions, one law and one
undergraduate, where they can discuss
their opinions and offer ideas for the
process.

The weekend’s events will
culminate Saturday night with the Alumni
Celebration on the front lawn. Alumni will
enjoy dinner and music from several
bands, including W & L- music groups
Southern Comfort, Jubilee and General
Admission. The current senior class is
invited to attend the celebration.

“Students started to realize that if we didn’t take
charge, the decisions would be made for us.”

—V|SHAL SAPRA, HEAD OF THE INTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL

Similarly to the Panhel
Presentation, Sapra’s PowerPoint detailed
the changes made this year in enforcement
and the current environment on campus.
Sapra stated that he was “happy with the
way the Board responded,” and that he
thought they were supportive of the current
steps being taken.

Both presentations were forwarded
to every Board of Trustees member to
ensure that all of the Board understands
what has gone on and what is being done.
The presentation was made to the Campus
Life Committee of the Board, which is the
direct line between student leaders and the
Board. ‘

This past weekend, members of
the W&L community gathered at
Zollman’s Pavilion for Buffalo Creek
Music Festival. Despite questions of
changes due to ﬁnancial needs, ‘‘I think
that it was successful, and Saturday
afternoon was a lot of fun,” says Ashley
Cassels 07, who attended Buffalo Creek

approved by every fraternity before they
go into action. Sapra stated that the IFC
“needed to do something,” but that a major
problem was the fact that they were
“dealing with an environment that is
resistant to change.”

The current enforcement of the
alcohol policy was a result of the IFC being
charged with fixing the problem last fall.
Sapra stated that “chapter ofﬁcers were
askedwhat they would be willing to do,”
and that they were “honest about the gaps
to the Boar .”

The Board intentionally left the
alcohol portion of the recommendation
vague so as to allow for student
involvement in every part of the process.
“Students started to realize that if we

Students enjoy the music and the atmosphere despite the rain at Zollman’s Pavilion.

Buffalo Creek does well despite concerns

last year. Security was available at the
gate for anyone who had problems, and
despite concerns of alcohol
crackdowns, everyone was able to have
fun.

Bands included Jacob’s Ladder,
Jason White w/ Jack Silverman, The
Breakfast, Jackass Flats, Wrinkle Neck
Mules, DJ Williams Projekt, and Tea
Leaf Green. Bands played Friday night,
Saturday afternoon, and Saturday night,

didn’t take charge, the decisions would be
made for us,” said Sapra.

The wristbands used sine Parents’
Weekend last fall are a solution the IFC
used to attempt to keep more with national
policies and liability issues.

The Board was encouraged the
weekend of May 6 to get out and see how
the new enforcement actually worked, and
more than one Board member was seen at
fraternity parties that weekend. The Board
was very pleased with Sapra’s
presentation, saying that it was “the first
progress they have seen in eighteen
months.” '

In response to questions as to
whether the enforcement had actually
changed things on campus or made
situations worse, Sapra stated that “we are
not close to where we need to be on any
of the three issues: alcohol, sexual assault,
and hazing,” but that the issue is more
about “balancing the level of enforcement
with keeping things on campus.” He also
said that students should not fear next Fall
being different from this Winter.

Cameron Wick 06, head of the
Buffalo Creek Committee, stated that
“the producers of the festival were all
very happy with everyone having a safe
time and enjoying the music and the
scene. We hope that the changes made‘
this year improve Buffalo Creek and
look forward to doing it again next

as

In the Monday, May 2 edition of The
Ring-tum Phi ran a letter to the editor
signed by 41 members of the faculty
entitled “Profs point to glass ceiling in
W&L Administration.” This letter
expressed concern about the management
of the University in regards to a glass
ceiling existing in Washington and Lee’s
Administration. Faculty who signed this
letter also expressed frustration with a lack
‘of progress and said, ‘women’s
contributions to Washington and Lee are
undervalued.”

The letter cited the rejection of
Dean Jeanine Stewart’s candidacy for
Dean of the College in favor of a male
Dean from Princeton as evidence of the

lack of progress. The letter also cited the
fact that of the 33 Board members, only
three are women and that only 22% of full
professors at the Law School are women
while only 15.8% of full professors in the
Williams‘School and the College are
women. Women hold only two of the 31
endowed chairs offered within the
Williams School and College. No woman
has ever held an endowed chair at the Law
School, nor has a woman ever held the
Directorship of the Frances Lewis Law
Center.

Tides turned somewhat on May 13,
when following the May meeting of the
Washington and Lee University Board of
Trustees, Dean David Partlett announced
a number of new Law School
appointments. Dorothy Brown was
chosen to succeed Blake Morant as the
next Director of the Frances Lewis Law

Center in May 2006, which was cited as a
“prestigious” position in the signed faculty
letter.

Subsequent campus discussion
following the signed faculty ‘letter
included letters from Allen Gillespie ’95
and Richard Hoover ’61 in the Trident, and
an article by Kaylee Hartung in the May 4
edition of the Trident. '

“Rather than blindly seeking and
celebrating diversity, as it appears the
faculty and administration are pre-
disposed to do, we should strive for unity,
for it is the commonality of values, ideas,
goals, and purpose that give rise to a
community and a culture,” Gillespie said
in his letter to the Trident.

The Ring-tum Phi encourages
debate and discussion of such issues so
relevant to this campus; for more student
input see Opinions page 4.

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 3

20 years...

We applaud recent events in
the faculty promotion process which
show deﬁnite progress in regards to the
alleged glass ceiling referred to in the
May 2 signed faculty letter. The law
school appointments just announced
list Dorothy Brown as the newest
Director of the Frances Lewis Law
Center. We know that the faculty hsted
this position as being one of the more
prestigious positions on campus and
bemoaned the fact that no woman had
ever been appointed. It seems that the
Board answered the faculty’s call to
“show leadership immediately and
address this crisis.”

Now that these positive steps
are being made towards the future, it is
time to turn our attention to all of the
contributions women have made during
the twenty years of coeducation on
Washington and Lee’s campus.

Since the next academic year
marks the twentieth year that women
have contributed to undergraduate life
on this campus, we believe that this
occasion should be celebrated. We
urge campus women’s groups such as
KEWL and the womens studies faculty
and students to use this year to
highlight notable Washington and Lee
women. University Administrators and
the Executive Committee should lend
these campus groups their full support

in this endavor.

Ideas for celebration include:
bring in successful female alumnae to
speak to the current generation of W&L
women. Make T-shirts, throw a party,
talk to long—time female faculty members

about the progress women have made,
start discussion about what room is left
for improvement when it comes to gender
relations on campus. Whatever we do,
we must mark this noteworthy occassion.

ByMaryChilds
IT’S NOT YOU, IT'S ME

I can honestly say that I’m shocked
at how little time is left before summer
vacation. Endings naturally bring about
reﬂections on the past, even for those of
us who are not graduating.

My best friend is one of those
people who constantly reminds me and
everyone around us what has been
accomplished in the past year. She. ﬁlled
pages and pages of my yearbook at the end
of every year recounting every adventure
that we’ve had.

One page was always devoted to
“The Warm-Fuzzy Memory List,” which
she ﬁlled with every memory she could
think of.

When I look back at these lists, I
realize just how much every year pushes
us on to the future that awaits us. Each
year, something happens that closes some
doors and opens others.

Even though we may not realize it
at the time, there is some significant
decision now that determines what
happens in the future.

I think that these events are not
speciﬁc to individuals, but also happen in
the history of institutions as well and W&L.
is no different. Lots of changes have
happened here this year. Some students,
myself included, are clinging to the
traditional symbol of the trident.

When I first read that it might be
changed, I sincerely hoped that it was an
April Fool’s joke. I love the trident as it
is, but I love what it symbolizes even more.
It’s the tradition of the university. When I
lay out on the front lawn, I feel like I could
be a student at any time in history.

I know that buildings have been
added, rebuilt, remodeled and torn down,
but when I glimpse the steeple of Lee
Chapel or the statue of George Washington
atop Washington Hall against the clear
blue sky, I feel a deep connection to the

students who have walked through the
columns since their original construction.
And I want to feel like I’ll have that same
connection to the students that will find
themselves and their futures here in the
next 100 years. ~

However, with all the changes that
have come about in the past few years, I’m
not sure that they’ll be attending the same
W&L as I am now.

Changes continue

We are in control of changes at W&L

I know that this really doesn’t have
anything to do with softening the edges
of the trident, but, nonetheless, it makes
me wonder what changes will keep the
university modern while preserving its
wonderful, traditional feel.

I think the biggest priority is to keep
the tradition of academic excellence while
maintaining an environment in keeping
with southern hospitality. As long as the
lovable essence isn’t lost, I can accept that
changes are necessary and important. I
truly believe that one of these changes was
recently expressed by concerned staff
members.

Next year marks the 20th
anniversary of the admission of women
students. But it certainly doesn’t feel like
it has been this long and the percentage of
female faculty clearly doesn’t come close
to the percentage of female students. Of
my two favorite professors, one is male
and the other is female.

I’ve had both male and female
professors ‘that I've really liked, and both
male and female professors that I didn’t
like. Both sexes clearly make great
professors, but, for some reason, females
are underrepresented here.

I’m not sure if this is due to lack of
applicants, a smaller percentage of women
who have become professors, or
discrimination.

While women may make up half the
population and cannot be considered a
minority in this respect, the letter to
President Burish, Membersof the Board
of Trustees, and the community shows that
there is still work to do before women are
equal to men on this campus.

As the feminist Charlotte Whitton
once said “Whatever women do they must
do twice as well as men to be thought half
as good.” I hope every student here feels
like they can do something to contribute
and to urge the administration to hire more
women.

After all, working for women’s
equality is not an issue that contradicts the
rights of men. Being pro-woman does not
lead to being anti—man. I feel like many
instances of under-representation are
accidental, and I certainly hope that that
is the case here.

Whatever the reason for a lack of
women faculty now, I hope it can change
in the future. We decide today what the
future holds tomorrow.

Research distracts profs  

By Chris Lauderman
CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

Professors should not be pushed
to publish. Don’t get me wrong, I am
in favornof some research. Its strength
lies in the fact that it keeps professors
fresh and up to date in their fields.
However, when it means that my
professor has to choose whether or not
he is going to teach me one—on-one so
I can grasp the material or tell me that
he can’t see me because his research
comes ﬁrst, I am no longer a supporter.
I believe most upperclassmen
would agree with me that W&L now
is not the institution that we
matriculated into three or four years
ago. This fact scares me. I have never
really bought into the argument that
W&L is forgoing its mission because
of its drive to be declared a top ten
liberal arts college by US News &
World Report.
However, I believe that we are
treading on very dangerous waters.
Teaching and student learning
should be our school’s number one
focus. That is what makes us great. I
am very glad that I chose to attend
W&L over a research university. I
would never want to go to a school
where office hours means visiting a TA
instead of talking with a professor.
Every week when I give a tour,
I tell prospective students about how

my professors are not ashamed of the label
“teacher” and that they would gladly take
time out of their extremely busy days to
help me with whatever I have needed. I
have been blessed with amazing professors
who have never turned me away.

But I don’t see how this can be the
case much longer. If we embark on a quest
to rise to the top of completely arbitrary
rankings, our professors will apparently
have to be famous for our peer institutions
to respect us, regardless of whether they
are good teachers or not.

The fact that professors are even
willing to have paren— teacher conferences
over Parent’s Weekend is astounding.
What other university in the country has a
faculty so heavily engaged in student’s
lives that they would take the time to meet
and explain college life to parents?

I think that if we are going to rise in
the rankings, we need to build from what
makes us the wonderful institution we
already are — a great faculty, deans who
interact with students, a large array of
course offerings, no TAs, and small class
sizes. The list can go on and on.

Over my past three years here, I
have come to love Washington and Lee
and what it stands for — honor, integrity,
and gentlemanly conduct. But what I love
most about W&L is what I have loved most
from the beginning: excellent teaching.

Ironically, if we take for granted our
calling to be a teaching university, we will
not only lose our niche, but also take a
dive in the coveted US News rankings.

“A lot of kids say, ‘I want to be a CSI because I like what they do on the show, and
then you tell them, ‘Well, you have to take four years of chemistry. ’And they say, ‘Oh. I
don’t wanna do that. ”’

Contact Response to Phi Staff
Editorial

The staff editorial published in
the May 9"‘ issue of the Ring Tum Phi
raised several issues that the Contact
Committee would like to address. The Phi
editorial pointed out that Contact’s
mission statement is to “appeal to as many
segments of the student body as possible.”
Contact has attempted to do this
throughout the past year.

This year alone, Contact brought or
helped to bring seventeen speakers to
campus including 2 outdoor adventurers,
2 speakers from opposite ends of the
abortion debate, a noted conservative
television show host, a universally
recognized left wing speaker and former
presidential candidate, a biographer of
George Washington, several non—partisan

speakers addressing the 2004 election, a
noted left leaning poverty lobbyistl
advocate, a speaker who discussed racial
issues, and a highly regarded defense and
homeland security expert.

This year the Committee sought to
balance the speaker lineup with various
topics and viewpoints; unfortunately, a
woman was not on the slate. The
Comrrrittee also makes its selections based
on contacts individual members have with
speakers. For example, the biographer of
George Washington was brought for a low
cost because of his being family friends
with a member of the Committee.

One problem that Contact
inevitably faces when making speaker
selections is cost and most women tend to
have higher speaking fees than their male
counterparts. For example, a woman with
as much name recognition as Ralph Nader

such as Katie Couric charges $115,000

plus first class expenses whereas Ralph

Nader (and Tucker Carlson) cost only

_ $15,000 plus expenses.

The Phi editorial made several
excellent suggestions as to speakers next
year. Two, Elizabeth Dole and Lorna
Tychostup, were both discussed for either
this year or next. Several of the Phi’s list
would cost nothing but expenses due to
their being elected ofﬁcials.

These would include Elizabeth
Dole, Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Barbara
Boxer, and Condoleezza Rice. The
problem with selecting elected ofﬁcials is
that, because they are not getting paid, they
do not hold to speaking engagements (that
is, if you can get them to schedule a school
speech) as strictly as their paid civilian
counterparts.

The rest of the list was also

composed of excellent suggestions as
reﬂected in their cost (keep in mind that
the entire Contact budget for 2004-2005
was approximately $63,000 and the entire
amount spent on our 2 keynote speakers,
Ralph Nader and Tucker Carlson, was only
$30,000), Maya Angelou— $53,000,
Christine Todd Whitman- $20,000, Paula
Zahn— $37,500, Christine Amanpour—
$50,000, Katie Couric— $115,000, Alice
Walker- $33,000 Jessica Lynch- $12,500
(Ms. Lynch only performs interviews
though, thus her appearance would not be
a practicality). ,

Dominique Dawes is $7,500 and
Carol Moseley Braun $15,000; both are
names that will receive serious
consideration for next year. As can be
seen, though, most of the other
suggestions are utterly impossible to
achieve unless the Executive Committee

chose to divert perhaps $100,000 or
more to Contact next year (hint hint).
In conclusion, the Contact
Committee would like to thank the Phi
, for working to right what many
consider to be an imbalance within the
Contact speaker slate. The Committee
promises to continue to bring the best
speakers within its limited budget
throughout the coming year. We as a
Committee encourage anyone with
suggestions for speakers to e-mail me
at kronenfeldd@wlu.edu.

Nader’s Lessons
important to all

We all can learn from Nader’s speech

By Anne Finley
THE BIG PICTURE

So last week, with the rest of the
world, I went to see Ralph Nader in Lee
Chapel. And surprisingly to me, I was
impressed by the well—spoken man who I
had expected to be a little crazy. Granted,
he might have had some more extreme
ideas to express had he actually been
allowed to discuss politics, but as it was I
found his central message to be
compelling: don’t be apathetic.

Question everything around you, all
the things that get under your skin but you
let go because you can “never change
things.” Complacency is boring — do
something about it.

It actually made me think (no, not I

about becoming a Green Party convert,
though never say never). For all of my
opinions, and all of my talk in articles like
these, can I really say I’ve inﬂuenced the
making of important changes? Can any of
us?

It is so easy not to become actively
involved with something you believe in.
Or, if you do get involved or even reach a
leadership level position, it often happens
that the big ideas you’ve formed in your
head of what should be done get pushed
back and never fully-realized. I’m
certainly guilty of this, however well-
intentioned I might have been.

Mr. Nader made me realize how
much effort a normal person can put into
something; how motivated and single-
rnindedly driven you have to be to actually

‘knows at least half of it never happens.

make things happen. In that way, he is
kind of a hero for me.

Whether or not any of us believe
with his ideas or not, he is devoted to a
cause and ﬁghts for it and you have to
respect that on some level. He ﬁghts
for the people who are too worn out
from working two jobs and raising kids
to have time to even question the
system.

Four years sounds like a long
time. But two, to my ceaseless
amazement, have already passed me by.
Maybe it is necessary for anyone with
some serious goals to accomplish in
their college life to sit down and
literally make a timetable.

Though you always imagine all
the things you’ll have time to get done
over Spring Term or Winter Break, God

We may not be in careers yet, but
I guess we have to learn to budget our
time and give ourselves deadlines if the
important stuff is actually going to get
done.

So, if you have it in you, learn
from our friendly visiting politician.
Figure out what you care about most
and ﬁght for it. Don’t expect that others
will get it done or the problems will
magically go away.

Get out of the mindset that it
isn’t “my job” or “my responsibility”
and take the initiative to strive for
whatever kind of change you are
looking for. '

Figure out what you care about most and ﬁght
for it. Don’t expect that others will get it done
or the problems will magically go away.

Dear Editor,

Given the recent discussion of
University hiring policy brought on by the
recent appointment of Dr. Howard Dobin
as Dean of the College, I felt compelled
to write to the Phi. Being a member of
the student search committee for Dean of
the College, I believe I have a special
insight into the issue. At first, I hesitated
to speak out, but a senior I have little to
lose.

As both Allen Gillespie ‘95 and
Richard Hoover ’61 discuss in recent
letters to the Trident, there seems to be a
great deal of concern that the faculty who
signed the now—ir1famous letter to the Phi
and Trident are basing their complaints off
a simplistic and small-minded interest in
numerical diversity. This view is seconded
by Dr. Jaciewicz in May 5 article by
Kaylee Hartung in the Trident. I want to
strongly question the two assumptions
that seem to be the basis of these views-

I- That the person who was hired
for the position was selected through a
lengthy search process, so he must be the
most qualified and suitable candidate.

2- That the most qualiﬁed person
for a position is usually a white male, and
if a woman or minority is hired, it must be
because he or she fulfilled some sort of
quota.

I fervently believe that these are
both false statements, and that something
has gone seriously awry in W&L’s hiring
practices.

In interviewing Dr. Dobin, I found
that he was the least knowledgeable of all
the candidates about the culture and
traditions of W&L. All of the other
candidates seemed to have researched
Washington and Lee and to be able to
provide preliminary comments or thoughts
on what the best qualities of our school
are. Dr. Jeanine Stewart, on the other
hand, was already an expert on the W&L
experience. This was not the case with
Dr. Dobin. I quote from the report I
submitted at the end of the search process:

“I am concerned that he [Dr. Dobin]
would not ﬁt well into the culture of W&L.
For example, when he posed questions to
students he was very concerned to ask us
what we did not like about W&L. While

 

I -.»*3i’&ﬁil~‘¥1A!tl!

 

some of the other candidates asked a
similar question of the students, I felt that
he was very concerned to pick apart
aspects of our school. He seemed very
skeptical about the culture of W&L. While
we do deserve scrutiny on some issues, I
did not feel that he was wholly diplomatic
in the way he went about the discussion.
He was perhaps a bit imperious and he
seemed to speak to us as an administrator
talking down to students. While I feel that
he is a creative and dynamic candidate, I
am not sure that he is the right ﬁt for W&L.
I am not sure that he would be happy here
and I think that he would step on toes...
overall I felt that he seemed unnecessarily
critical of W&L for someone who is a job
candidate. Also, I think that he would turn
students off—he really came off as a high-
rolling Ivy League administrator.”

Tell me, does this evaluation (which
is dated February 23, LONG BEFORE any
of the discussion in the newspapers) speak
of a candidate who is well-suited to the
culture of W&L? He seemed more
concerned with discussing the wonders of
Princeton than his excitement about
working at W&L. Contrast this with what
I wrote of Dr. Stewart:

“In short, I found it hard to judge
Dean Stewart against the other candidates.
The tone of our conversation with her was
much different than that with the other
candidates. Because of her knowledge of
W&L and of the position of Dean, I found
that she was able to provide much more
speciﬁc examples of certain practices and
behaviors she would like to see
encouraged. I was impressed that she did‘
not hesitate to be critical of the University
and had a distinctive vision for the position
of Dean and for the College. Further I felt
that of all the candidates she was the most
adamant about committing the University
to more diverse hiring practices, which I
thought was very appropriate. I also
thought she made a fairly good case for
why continuity would be good in the
Dean’s Ofﬁce.”

Those are the good qualities I
observed in her interview. That said, I ﬁnd
it difﬁcult to draw comparisons—since the
other candidates knew much less about
Washington and Lee, I think Dean Stewart
has a certain natural advantage and I do

 

not want to “penalize” the other
candidates for not having that. I would
say that in this process I sought for
those who seemed to have a clear
“vision” for the College. The two
candidates that most did that in my
opinion were [a third candidate] and
Dr. Stewart.”

Let me say that my status as a
feminist does not mean that I do not
want the most qualiﬁed candidate for
the position. But when I saw that Dr.
Dobin had been hired, I was absolutely
horriﬁed. I think it’s highly improbable
that the ’ search committee
recommended Dr. Dobin. I believe
instead that the search committee was
overridden because hiring him would
allow us to plaster “W&L Steals
Princeton Administrator” all over the
front page of our website.

It is a fallacy, then, that Dr.
Dobin was the most qualified
candidate. Not only is Dr. Stewart a
stronger candidate, I ranked TWO
OTHER candidates above him as well.
Of course, I hope that Dr. Dobin will
prove me wrong and become an
admirable and sensitive leader of the
College. I also wish the best to Dr.
Stewart, who in my opinion has been
treated most unfairly. I further urge
President Burish and Provost Williams
to examine their decisions closely.
What is more important? Having a
fancy news story to put on our website?
Playing in the same sandbox as
Princeton and Swarthmore? I think not.
In the twenty-first century,

W&L should be making strides
towards building its own unique
identity. We should be rejecting the
myth of the heroic outsider and
choosing the most qualified leaders for
our institution. We should be
diversifying. We should be examining
our traditions closely, keeping the best
ones, and rooting out those that may
be hurtful to our progress. Students
and faculty are at the heart of what
Washington and Lee is all about. And
in the hiring of a new Dean of the
College, their voices have been
silenced by the work of a few
administrators. I hope that this is not
the start of a new W&L tradition.

By Bree Melton
ASSISTANT LIFE EDITOR

Step back with us, across the sea to
17”‘ century Venice. Here you will ﬁnd
Kate of Shakespeare’s The Taming of the
Shrew tamed and gone leaving a self-
righteous Petruchio searching for a new
and more easily controlled wife. John
Fletcher’s The Tamer Tamed is a hilarious,
fast-paced, sexually charged account of
how Petruchio is schooled by his new wife
Maria in the proper way to treat a strong
and independent woman.

The play is staged in the classic
Shakespearean theatre form that draws
audiences from three sides into the play to
interact with and respond to the actors as
they present the story. Uproarious ﬂowery

- verse rolls over the audience laced with

subtle and not-so-subtle sexual innuendos
and allusions.

In preparation, all of the actors
participated in period movement classes
from Nona Monahin of Amherst College.
We learned how to bow, dance, andrwe
listened to Renaissance music in order to
get into character.

New to W&L theatre staff, Kimberly
Jew directs. Starring is senior Vicky
Stanham as the intelligent and quick-witted
Maria opposite freshman Charles Barbour
who plays the macho and caustic
Petruchio. Charlie Boisky graces the W&L

P stage once more hilariously portraying old

Gremio. Junior Ligia Abreu is cast as
Maria’s sweet yet scheming sister Livia,
and sophomore Michael Wagoner gives
life to her bumbling beloved. The girls’
traditional father Petronious is played by

, g sophomore Alejandro Selin. Ruth Esponda
7 leads the women of the play as the

commanding and independent Bianca,
younger sister to the late Kate.

Act I opens during Maria and
Petruchio’s wedding party. Instead of
dutifully submitting to her new husband,
Maria runs off and barricades herself in
the house. While Petruchio is off trying
to get in to his wife, three of the men make
bets on how quickly Petruchio will break
the will of Maria.

Act I also reveals the romance
between Livia and her sweetheart,

- Rowland. However it’s to Gremio, Livia’s

Spring production
pays hilarious
tribute to the Bard

wealthy and ancient suitor, that Petronious
would like to see his youngest daughter
wed. .

Much of the action in The Tamer
Tamed takes place in the upper level of
the beautiful set. In the first balcony scene
in the play, Bianca encourages Maria to
defy her husband and keep him from her
bed until he promises to treat her with
equal respect.

In the second act, Livia joins with
Bianca and Maria’s cause to stave off her
imminent marriage to Gremio, mockingly
scorning Rowland in the process.
Rowland mistakes the ruse for actual
disdain, but the gentleman Tranio sees
through it.

‘Also in Act II, the rest of the city
and country women join Bianca, Maria
and Livia in a very unladylike display.
Their rebellious actions frighten and anger
the men, but Petruchio agrees to accept
Maria’s conditions if she admits him to
the house thinking he will placate her now
and break her later.

But Act HI proves Maria is not so

’ easily taken. The first scene shows Tranio

making a bet with Rowland that not only
will he soon be in love with Livia again,
but that he, Tranio, will himself reconcile
the supposed rift between them. It turns
out that Tranio is working with Livia and
Bianca to prevent the marriage between
Gremio and_Livia and bring about the
union of Livia and Rowland. When Maria,
Petruchio and his friend Hortensio take the
stage again, Maria does her best to anger
Petruchio and prove to him that he will
not control her. She ﬂirts with Hortensio
and grants him a boon.

In response, Petruchio feigns
sickness to try and gain sympathy from
Maria. She responds by acting as if he
has the plague and will die, locking him
in the house and removing all their

STEVEN MARINOS / PHOTO EDITOR

‘ ‘Tamer’ opens May 20

belongings. Busting out of the house after
everyone has run off in fear of catching
his illness, Petruchio roars that once more
Maria has gotten the better of him.

Act IV opens with Petronious and
Gremio agreeing on a marriage contract.
Maria and Petruchio confront each‘ other
once more, he graciously offers to forgive
her because he does truly love her. She
endures his yelling, but when he threatens
to hit her, Maria will not stand for it.
Tranio, Bianca, and Livia are found
plotting still.

This time Bianca coaches Livia to
pretend to be ill and accept the marriage
with Grerriio, promising that all will work
out in the end. Hortensio tries to help
Maria and Petruchio reconcile as he can
tell that they still love each other, but
neither is willing to compromise with the
other.

In the ﬁnal act, Bianca provides the
marriage contracts that are supposedly for
Gremio and Livia, but Rowland and
Petronious also sign as witnesses.
Rowland is distraught thinking he is
witnessing his love being turned over to
old Grerriio. But Tranio announces that
Rowland has lost his bet with him and bids
him examine the marriage contract he
signed. Thus Rowland discovers that it is
he who is married to Livia, not Grerriio.

As Petruchio’s servants prepare to
set sail with him, Hortensio enters
armouncing that all the ﬁghting with Maria
has killed their master. All enter mourning
over Petruchio’s body, but Maria does not
repent the way she treated him, only is sad
that it had to end like it did. Hearing this,
Petruchio leaps up as he was only feigning
death. He begs Maria to explain to him
why she treated him so poorly. To which
she responds, “I have done my worst, and
have my end: I’ve tarn’d ye, And now am
vow’d your servant.”

Thus the play ends: everything as it
should be. So much work and care has
been put into this production, and it should
prove to be a very exciting ride. It opens
Thursday night at 8 in the Johnson theatre.
Of the play Charles Barbour says, “I am
stoked!!!” Performances run May 20, 21,
23, 24 at 8 pm and May 22 at 2 pm. For
tickets, call the box ofﬁce (x8000). Cheer
wench!

Lexington and sushi

Never the two shall mix well?

By Marshall Rule
MANAGING EDITOR

There are many words in the
English dictionary that are ﬁne on their
own but should never go together.

“Warm” and “natty” should not go _

together. “Rain” and “Buffalo Creek”
is not a good combination. “W&L
basketball” and “win” do not go well
together. .
“Lexington” and “sushi” fall
under this category.

Lexington, on its own, is a ﬁne
thing. While the town is quite boring
at times, it is also ﬁlled with beautiful
scenery. And when it comes down to
it, there are plenty of things to do if
you are creative enough to look for
them.

Sushi, on its own, is a brilliant
thing. Possibly the best food ever
invented by man (if you don’t think
about what you are eating), sushi has a
special place in my heart.

However, Lexington and sushi
are not things that should mix.

Many people living in
Rockbridge County moved here from
bigger cities in order to escape to the
quiet country life. Many of these
people probably know good sushi and
have eaten it on many occasions.

However, for some reason, I am a little
skeptical about sushi prepared in
Lexington.

Raw meat is not something that
should be played around with,
especially by a 16 year old in aWizards
basketball jersey who prepared my
sushi when I went to Lexington’s lone
sushi restaurant the other day. I don’t
think 16 year old kids from Lexington
make veiy authentic sushi.

While the sushi was fairly good,
especially considering the source, you
could still never pay me enough money
to eat the sushi that the co-op sells on
select days for lunch. Something about
day old sushi from Lexington makes
me a little nauseous. I can’t eat the
food in the Dining Hall without
needing my stomach pumped, much

less am I going to try the sushi.

But the real problem about my
sushi outing the other day was the
quality of service. This seems to be a
reoccurring theme in Lexington
restaurants, but I have never had worse
service anywhere than I did at the sushi
place on Saturday night.

It took us at least ﬁve minutes to
even be acknowledged, and another
five to get our menus. After finally
ordering four waters and a Pepsi, we
had to go up to remind them about the
drinks 10 minutes later. After 20
minutes, we still weren’t even asked
what we wanted to eat.

After 35 minutes in the
restaurant, we were ﬁnally able to order,
but of course, to continue with the
theme of the outing, the food took
forever to arrive.

At first we thought we were just
unlucky. Maybe the “waiter that
wanted to be an actor” just kept
forgetting about our table. But then we
realized that we were actually getting
the best service of any one in the place.

The group of three guys that had
ordered before we had even arrived got
their food ten minutes after ours.

It’s kind of sad to think that
restaurants are able to treat customers
like pet dogs just because we don’t have
any alternative places to eat. Any
Lexington restaurant would not be able
to survive in any bigger city.

This attitude towards customers
(especially college students), is quite
annoying to me. I like to think that
Washington and Lee helps the town as
much as the town helps us, but I think
that the relationship is a little one sided.

Business skyrockets for local
stores and restaurants during Parents’
Weekend and Graduation. In the sushi
restaurant the other day, there were
about six tables occupied, ﬁve of those
tables were taken by W&L students,
and the other by a Keydet and his
family.

I am not looking for special
attention, just some common decency.

A How—to on Spring Term
Breka explains the do’s of Spring

By Bree Melton and Eka Akpakip
BREKA

This campus has got spring fever
and the only prescription is MORE
COWBELL! ! But no, seriously. . .people
are breaking up, hooking up, and then
shacking up, but to what end? There are
only two weeks left in school so now is
the time to ﬁgure out your summer plans.
Eka is completely of the school of thought
that: Who needs spring ﬂings?

It’s time for summer ﬂings! Going
away for the summer is usually the perfect
time to meet that special-for-just—three—
months someone. Real relationships can
wait.

So one way to look at spring ﬂings
is: hit up the seniors! If they’re not already
in a serious relationship that will lead to
marriage, all they want is to get a little
action before branching out into the “real
world.” And all you want is a guy that’s
21. Sooooo convenient.

The prime choice is that senior who
just broke up with his long time girlfriend
in anticipation of graduation. He’s alone,
maybe just a little sad, and definitely in
need of some spring lovin’. He also

probably doesn’t want to start anything
serious, but then neither do you!

With a lighter spring term
load, you definitely have time for this.
And considering the serious lack of
parties this past term, you really don’t
have too much of an opportunity to meet
a ton of random hook—ups. ,

Let’s face it - having a consistent
one is just easier and most economically
efficient. Yeah, that’s right, we paid
attention in 101. I

So we also know the meaning
of opportunity cost. That guy you met
at Buffalo Creek? Say something to
him! You never know what could
happen. If you don’t exchange phone
numbers or don’t ask him on a date, you
could miss out on initiating something
you could come back to in the fall. Plant
the seed in his head now, so when he
returns next semester he’s had you on
his mind all summer!

Breka’s advice for the
remainder of the term is to seize your
opportunities. The beautiful weather
giving you that added energy, how can
you wait? Be frisky, be daring, take the
chance! What do you have to lose?

Going away for the summer is usually

. the perfect time to meet that special—for-

just—three—months someone.

 

Pet peeves galore

By Kristine Early
THE MILK AND CHEESE G|RL

You sleep through your alarm and
miss English class- for the fourth time in
a row. You get a test back in Calculus, and
needless to say, you didn’t do quite as well
as you expected. You manage to spill your

» drink all over your brand new outﬁt at

lunch. You almost trip up the stairs in the
Commons. Give up. It’s just one of those
days. Maybe it’s just one of those weeks.
Don’t fight it. Be bitter. Find the bad in
everything. Vent your frustrations at the
minutiae in life, like:

1) Tortilla chips without salsa. It’s
like pie without ice cream, completely
sacrilegious.

2) PDAs. Unless the Milk and
Cheese Girl is personally involved.

3) People who wear spandex to the
gym. It doesn’t look good on anyone. In
fact, it should be outlawed.

4) Having to wait in line to get to
the keg. We need our beer, and the clock
is ticking.

5) People who cut in line at the keg.
We need our beer, and the clock is ticking.

6) Glassketchup bottles. Seriously,
they’re way too much work. ,

7) Purple and green ketchup.
Sometimes companies get a little too
creative.

8) Country music. It should be
outlawed right along with spandex.

9) The death of the speaking
tradition. Really, how hard is it to smile
and say “hi”?

10) People that have long
conversations on their cell phones in
public. ,

11) Over-attentive waiters. When
my glass is ten—elevenths full, I really don’t
need any more to drink.

12) Under—attentive waiters. (Can
you really win with me?)

13) People who take life too
seriously.

14) Unﬁnished to-do lists.

15) People who block the aisles at
Wal—Mart with their carts or their girth.

16) When all the elliptical machines
are in use at the gym.

17) Unidentified meat at the
Marketplace. Is that pork or beef?

18) Pop~up ads. I’m sure you
already have a fine porn collection.

19) Being woken up from a nap. It’s
my personal ultimate pet peeve.

-.x/'

20) Spam. Actually, if you met the
type of person who would buy Rogaine
or ehem.. enhancement products on-
line, you’d probably feel a bit better
about your own life.

21) Telemarketers.

22) People who forget to put

away messages up. Okay, call me a
voyeur, but even “Away” leaves me
more satisfied the “Idle.”

23) Cold coffee. It may be worse

I than warm beer.

24) People that make comments
throughout the entire movie. Okay,
that’s me. But I try to be discreet. Throw
popcorn at me and I’ll shut up.

25) When your teacher says
something to the likeness of: “Well, I
don’t think we’re going to have time to
discuss Precipitate Effects on the
Mechanical Behavior of Aluminum
Copper/llloys, so you don’t have to read
it if you didn’t get a chance to last
night.” Hey, if you had to suffer through
that thirty—page masterpiece, so should
everyone.

26) Leaving a restaurant and
smelling like smoke for the rest of the
night. ‘

27) Lugging all your laundry (two
months worth) down three ﬂights of
stairs only to discover that all the
washers are full.

28) Realizing right after the door
closes that you left your key card on top
of your desk.

29) Overbooked airplane ﬂights.

30) Weather that goes from
reasonably warm to freezing cold to
scorching hot all within a three—hour
time span. Hmrnrn...I wonder where
that happens?

31) Having to limit your thoughts

to five pages, double-spaced. Or having ‘

to expand your thoughts to ﬁve pages,
double-spaced.

Being resentful isn’t easy.
Whenever you are tempted to think-
“Wow, look at how beautiful the world
is! The sun is shining. I’m in good
health. I have lots of caring supportive
friends and a loving family. I’m at one
of the best schools in the entire country.”
— you need to suck it up and resist. Refer
to my list for a little help. After all, being
melancholy and depressed is so hot right
now.

Be bitter. Find the bad in everything. Vent your
frustrations/at the minutiae in life, like Tortilla
chips without! salsa. It’s like pie without ice
cream, /completely sacrilegious.

Hugh’s soul:

Irate: Paris Hilton

Paris and The Fisherman were meant to be together

By Hugh Trout
THE FISHERMAN

It is rare in life that one finds their
soul mate, a person that truly understands
you on the most basic and intimate level.
I am lucky enough to have found that
person and her name is Paris Hilton.

While we may not look all that
much alike (the common theme is that we
are both attractive and classy), we are truly
the same soul in two different bodies. I
can only give the overwhelming evidence
that supports my claim. Allow me to
explain.

First, we both enjoy the nightlife.
Yes, there may be others who would claim
the same, but no one is as brazenly
dismissive of responsibility in everyday
life as we are in our mutual devotion to
“living the dream.”

She enjoys rocking it straight street,
I define it. She enjoys being dismissive
of common problems that we all must deal
with, I am about to fail out because of
that. She has a sex tape that has been
released, mine comes out next week. She
enjoys living in a large city, and
I. . .ok. . .maybe we are a little different.

For example, she is sort of into that
whole “I’m a rich blonde whorish
princess” look where as I rock the “I’m
an irresponsible frat boy in need of a
haircut who thinks Salemo’s is a luxurious
meal and a 30—pack of Bud Light should
be considered fine wine.”

That is more of a taste thing, but we
really are the same at heart. She displays
a glorious rejection of anything that could
be recognized as a goal, dream, or thought.

Anyone who could so brazenly
dismiss the common responsibilities that
we all are expected to assume is a friend
of mine. But anyone who could so
effectively do nothing, and I mean nothing,
is a soul mate of mine.

‘ I’m pretty sure it was Gandhi that
said “accomplishing things is for suckers.”
Actually, I may have dreamed that, but it
seems like something Gandhi would have
said if he had thought of it.

If there is one thing that I have
learned in this life, it’s that if you stop
worrying about things, either they go away
or someone else will step up for you and
take care of it. This is what many like to
call “working the system.”

If you want to be more like me and
Paris, you need to change the way you live
your life, but that’s actually a much simpler
thing to do than one might think.

All you have to do is get up in the
morning (when you feel like it, alarm
clocks are only a smaller form of torture),

and stand in front of a mirror and say the
following: “I am a good looking person
and I deserve to get what I want from
everyone else because I’m me and no one
else. is.” I

There may be those who get in your
face with “hey, that’s not fair” or “you are
horribly irresponsible and need to grow up
and recognize that you must do things for
people other than yourself,” but all you
need to do is, in the words of one of my
good friends, “Brush your shoulders off.”

We can even see Presidents
exhibiting such behavior. The most
obvious example is our current Republican
wonder-hero. W has needless to say
brushed off many people who have
claimed he has misled us or has been
irresponsible.

Clinton lived more of a party life in
the Oval Office than the Red Hot Chili
Peppers, and he still has tons of fans to
this day.

So remember, the next time
someone asks you to do something, say,
“is this what Paris Hilton would do?”.

Anyone who could so brazenly dismiss
the common responsibilities that we all are
expected to assume is a friend of mine.

The Lexington police wanted to catch a few DUls the night of Buffalo

Creek, but instead of putting up a sobriety checkpoint on the road to -

ZolIman’s, they did so by the entrance of Hull’s Drive-in Movie
Theater, which was showing Vin Diesel in “The Pacifier,” which is,

yes, a family feature. What exactly were they thinking?
