UVa saga continues
The 17 students who were
arrested after their sit-in at
UVa’s administration build-
ing, Madison Hall, appeared
before the University Judiciary
Committee on Monday, May

1. According to The Cavalier
Daily, the students were or-
dered to write letters apologiz-
ing to and thanking several
groups on campus. They were
convicted by the committee on
three counts of violating the
committee’s standards. The
charges are: unauthorized entry
into or occupation of UVa
facilities, intentional disruption
of UVa activities and failing to
follow directions of UVa of-
ﬁcials acting to enforce any of
the other standards of conduct.
The students must write to the
University police department,
the university administration
and several employees whose
schedules were disrupted by the
sit-in.

The Phi will return to news-
tands on Monday, May 15 with
our penultimate issue of the
2005-2006 school year.

Lexington resident and certi-
ﬂed scuba diver Charles Volpe
drowned at Jordan’s Point last
week. He is the fourth person to
drown at that spot on the Maury
River since 2003.

Volpe, a 16-year-old sopho-
more at Rockbridge County High
School, was swimming upriver of
the darn around 4 p.m. on Sunday,
April 23 when he and Bryc Talley,
a friend who was with him, were
both swept over the dam. Talley
was able to escape the dam’s un-
dercurrent, but Volpe was pinned
under the surface by the force of
the water.

Lt. Steve Crowder of the Lex-
ington Police Department refuted
rumors that the boys had been
playing on the top of the dam.

“After speaking with witness-
es who were on the scene, I’m
adamantly convinced they were
swimming upstream and were
washed over the dam.”

Crowder, who coordinates di-
saster management for the Lex-
ington police, was called just
after 4 p.m. and told Volpe had
drowned. The officer immediate-
ly called Virginia’s Department of
Emergency Management, which
provides logistical support — div-
ers, helicopters, Red Cross assis-
tance — to local departments.

“The local divers were there
pretty fast,” Crowder said. “The
State Police called and couldn’t
initially provide support, but they
worked out some details and were
able to come with a helicopter in
about 35 minutes, which is excel-
lent response time.”

The Rockbridge Country
Sherilf’s oﬂice has two divers,
and there is a Swiﬁ Water Res-
cue group based in Buena Vista.
Crowder also said divers from
WestVaCo, a paper company,
came over from Covington, Va. to
assist the search teams.

Volpe’s body was discovered

just below the dam by a cadaver
dog from the Blue and Gray
Search Dog Company. The group
works with the state’s emergency
management department. Divers
from the Augusta Country Sher-
iff’s Department were then able
to ﬁnd the body underwater. The
search took nearly 24 hours.
According to his obituary,
Volpe was a member of the high
school’s jazz band and tennis
team. He also held seven certiﬁ-
cations from the National Associ-
ation of Underwater Instructors, a

group that certiﬁes scuba divers.

At 4 p.m. on Sunday the Mau-
ry River was moving past the
U.S. Geological Service’s stream

second. ‘ The average stream ﬂow

School names women deans

Female students and faculty say school must still do more

By Jessica Shaw
STAFF WRITER

On July 1, newly appointed
Deans Janet lkecla and Elizabeth
Knapp will join an all-male ad-
ministration in Washington Hall.

The announced resignation of
Dean Ellen Mayock on Feb. 28
marked the departure of the only
female member of the academic
administration. In the controver-
sy surrounding her resignation,
many faculty members and stu-
dents have taken a stand in clear
contention with the lack of diver-
sity in the administration.

“I think it’s subtle. It teaches
male and female students that
there’s something unusual about
women who want to be in charge,”
Associate Professor of Politics
Robin Leblanc said. “It can often
cast a negative light on ambitious
women on any level.”

Leblanc is only one of the fac-
ulty members challenging this
situation.

In the 24 hours following
Mayock’s announced resignation,
junior Paten Hughes compiled a
petition containing 311 signatures
protesting the lack of women in
the academic administration.

“I didn’t know what else do,

and I wanted there to be a way
to voice my concern, my friends’
concern, other students’ concern,”
Hughes said.

Even with the addition of
Ikeda and Knapp, the school’s ef-
forts to reach gender equilibrium
among students since 1985 are
not reﬂected in the diversity of its
academic administrators. Many
faculty and students view this as a
problem on several levels.

“I feel like it’s hard as a wom-
an on this campus to feel like I
can be successful where I don’t
see women being promoted, and
I don’t see their successes being
honored,” Hughes said. “Without
women in these positions, how
can we feel like we belong in
those positions?”

There are other concerns with
the shortage of women in posi-
tions of power. According to
Mayock, many young women
seek her out for advice regarding
sexual abuse and other private
matters. She said that being the
sole female this year was tough
because there was no other outlet
for guidance.

Mayock also added that as the
solitary female voice in meetings
and decision-making, it was easy
for her expression to be muffled.

“It has become very clear to me
that if you have only one or two
[women], the voice is not heard,”
she said. “You need more women
at the table. I do not believe that
our administration purposefully
ignores women, [but] if it’s only
one woman, it’s a tough road.”

Functioning in the academic
administration for two full years,
Mayock said she noticed some
subtleties in male behavior. She
said men tended to ask about her
children repeatedly, offer hugs
instead of handshakes and un-
dermine her decisions carried out
with the proper authority.

“For every behavior, I under-
stand the genesis of the behavior,
and I truly believe that it’s out of
a desire for human contact. How-
ever, the reality of this type of be-
havior creates a huge obstacle for
women.”

Because the presence of men
is so dominant, Leblanc said they
are not forced to interact with
women regularly, and therefore
lack some of the skills necessary
to maintain a professional rela-
tionship.

“Professional women have
to work with men. They learn to

towns or factory complexes, but
many do not ﬁll those functions
any longer.

“The dam serves no purpose
that I know of,” City Manager
Tim Ellestad said. “There are a
lot of dams on the Maury. They
dammed the river to allow barg-
es to go up river. Jordan’s Point
used to be Lexington’s industrial
center.”

Low rise dams can be as tall as
25 feet or as small as six inches,
according to the Miami (Ohio)
Conservatory District. The dams,

because of their low height, ap-
pear harmless, but dangerous cur-
rents below the dam can easily
trap swimmers.

“The area below the dam is
particularly diﬂicult to deal with
because of cascading, swirling
water,” Ellestad said.

Ellestad and Crowder both
said the area has sufﬁcient re-
sources to deal with disasters of
this nature.

Here ’s the latest up-
date on who ran afoul
of the law during the
last few weeks. We
took a peek at this
weeks police reports
to see what you ’ve

been up to...

Pit bulls run amok
Local resident Thomas
Sloan, Jr. was charged with
allowing a pit bull to run

at large. The charge was
issued at 8:25 a.m. on Fri-
day, April 14. He was also
charged with not having a
rabies vaccine for the dog or
a city dog license.

Yet another DUI
Joseph West, a resident of

Midlothian, Virginia, was
charged with a DUI on
Thursday, April 20. He was
stopped at 1 a.m. and also
charged with failure to obey
a highway sign.

Do the cops have a
quota or something?

Michael Trani was arrested
on Sunday, April 9 and
charged with public drunk-
enness. Trani, a Covington,
Virginia resident, was ar-
rested around 11:15 p.m.

Wild and reckless
Caroline Beda was charged
with a variety of traﬁic of-
fenses on April 24. When

to maintain control of her
vehicle, reckless endan-
germent and traveling the
wrong way on a one way

Police prowl Foxﬁelds

Oﬁicers crack down on underage drinking as college students turn out in droves

By Sarah Kientz
STAFF WRITER

Increased security at the Fox-
ﬁeld horse races on Saturday re-
sulted in a more controlled event,
police said.

Lieutenant John Teixeira of
the Albemarle County Police De-
partment said the department’s
goal was to “create a safer atmo-
sphere” at Foxﬂeld.

The police increased their
ranks from 50 to 250 ofﬁcers pres-
ent at the event, Teixeira said.

“In the past several years we
have not been on the inside, but
this year we took over the interior
ground,” Teixeira said, referring
to the area within the circular
horse track where most students
spend time.

Teixeira estimated that there
were 20,000 people at Foxﬂeld,
70 percent of which were college
students.

The increased security mea-
sures were intended to keep stu-
dents in line.

“In recent years there has been
a dramatic increase in the amount
of disorderly conduct, ﬁghts and
indecent exposure,” Teixeira said.
“It was really getting out of hand
and that’s why we increased the
number of ofﬁcers.”

Before the event, the Albe-
marle County Police and Virginia
State Police distributed green ﬂi-
ers throughout Washington and
Lee’s campus, warning that “po-
lice will be observing patrons
upon their arrival by chartered
buses and in their personal ve-
hicles. Patrons entering the race
will be monitored for intoxication
and legal age requirements, and
those found to be violating the
law while entering the event will
not gain admittance.”

Sophomore Kathy Garman
said she saw those threats in ac-
tion upon arriving at the ﬁeld.

“Within the ﬁrst 20 minutes of
being at Foxﬁelds I saw at least
four people being taken away by
cops right as we walked in,” Gar-
man said. “There were bike cops
riding through trafﬁc looking for
open containers and security at
the gate when you walked in was
checking bags.”

Although over 100 arrests
were made at the event, Teixeira
said he felt the heightened secu-
rity achieved its goal.

“The number of ﬁghts and dis-
orderly conduct dropped dramati-
cally,” Teixeira said. “A majority
of students had a good time and
acted appropriately, but unfortu-
nately there was still that minor-
ity who thinks it’s a place to get
drunk and get out of hand.”

Teixeira added that only one

Students drink and socialize during the Foxﬂeld races.

W&L student was arrested at Fox-
ﬁelds and charged with underage
possession of alcohol.

The student was released on
summons.

The arrested student did not
respond to multiple requests for
comment.

Freshman Tommy Pignatelli
said he was upset that the W&L
student was arrested though be-
having responsibly.

Pignatelli said there was more
outrageous behavior throughout
the event.

“A lot of people didn’t really
watch the horses. Most people
just sat around, ate and drank,”
Pignatelli said. “There were a lot
of drunk people making out with
each other and throwing up.”

Meanwhile, Garman, who at-
tended the event last year as well,
said she felt students acted more
appropriately this year at Foxﬁeld

because of the increased number
of police.

“In some respects people toned
it down from last year,” Garman
said. “People were still drinking,
but it was in moderation. There
were less people being belligerent
and falling down drunk.”

Garman also said she had
more ﬁm at this event because
there was less drinking than the
year before.

She said, “I had more fun this
year because people were not
quite as ridiculous and you didn’t
have to worry about taking care of
people as much.”

Pignatelli, however, said that
he felt the event was only fun for
those who were drinking.

“I thought it was boring,” he
said, “but that could have been
because I was a sober driver.”

Junior Kelly Price said the
behavior seen at past events war-

ranted increased security and that
the added officials will make the
event safer in the future.

“They’ve had problems in the
past with underage drinking, and
having more security at the event
is a good idea,” Price said. “Hav-
ing more police there will make
it safer.”

Heightened security will de-
crease drinking at Foxﬁeld next
year, Price said, “because inevita-
bly people are going to be getting
in trouble.”

Teixeira also said he hoped
that this year’s law enforcement
at Foxﬂeld will set an example
and act as a warning for students
in years to come.

A change in behavior, Price
said, “depends on whether or not
people take the threat of increased
security seriously and realize there
is a real chance that people drink-
ing underage will be arrested.”

On April 21 Max Sandler
was formally charged with
possession of marijuana.
Sandler originally ran into
trouble on Jan. 7, when
Lexington Police officers
entered a room he was in
around 1:20 a.m. The of-
ﬁcers had been advised of a
complaint that people were
smoking marijuana in the
room, and, alter informing
W&L security oﬂicers of
the complaint, the police
entered the room. Police
Chief Bruce Beard said three
bongs were in plain sight on
a table. The three month de-
lay in ﬁling charges occurred
because the bongs were sent
to a crime lab for testing.

Jefferson Street jaunt
Natalie Mackie, age 47, was
arrested on April 18 and

charged with being drunk in
public. Officer Fred Smith saw
Mackie, a native of Smithﬁeld,
Virginia, walking on Jefferson
Street. The ofﬁcer said Mackie
was showing signs of public
intoxication.

Adam Thomas Lotts was
charged with simple assault

on April 19. Ofﬁcers reported
to 525 Maury Street after a
woman called and said Lotts
had grabbed her around the
neck and forced her arm behind
her back, dragging her towards
the house. The woman also
complained that Lotts was
drunk. The oﬂicers left the
scene and went to obtain a war-
rant, but shortly after they left
the woman called to say Lotts
had become violent again. The
officers returned to the house
after the woman’s second call.

think men are like them.
But some men, especially
the senior men at this institu-
tion, have not been forced in
the same way to experience
women as like them,” she
said.

Leblanc said W&L oﬁen
runs into difﬁculties recruit-
ing women in part due to its
geographic location. Lexing-
ton may not offer an appeal-
ing environment for single
women or those trying to
raise children. It also may not
provide decent jobs for both
spouses in a marriage situa-
tion.

“Recruiting single males
or females can present a chal-
lenge to a small, rural com-
munity,” Acting President
Harlan Beckley said.

Much of this year was ded-
icated to celebrating women
for their 20-year legacy on
this campus.

Mayock, as the sole fe-
male academic dean, played a
large role in organizing these
events, planning speakers and
designing a calendar.

“The positive feedback
has come from men in older
classes, some of whom didn’t
favor the concept of co-edu-
cation, but have been pleased
by the positive results.”

Such events took months
of planning and dedication.
As a woman in the adminis-
tration, Mayock could devote
a lot of her time to issues that
may be overlooked by her
male counterparts.

Because of the image she
upheld, many faculty mem-
bers were greatly affected by
her resignation.

LeBlanc said, “When
Mayock was ‘encouraged’ to
step down, it just made me
feel lesser.”

LeBlanc said that she had
a day when she was embar-
rassed in front of her students,
because she said they had
seen “that the women were
in leadership roles and they
could be thrust aside with
ease. I thought my students
would see me as a second-rate
member of the faculty.”

Sometime this month,
Hughes will present a revised

Campus Women

in W&L culture

version of her petition to the
Board of Trustees. "

“I think the biggest prob-
lem with regard to gender re-
lations on our campus is that
we don’t view it as a prob-
lem,” she said.

Alumnus Chris Wood
(’89) has been in correspon-
dence with the administration
concerning his displeasure
with the hype of Celebrating
Women.

In his letter, however,
Wood claims he certainly em-
braces the presence of wom-
en. He merely disapproves
of their isolation by means
of celebration, and said that
many alumni agree.

“In my opinion, it is much
more important to have the -
right people in the position,
whatever [race or sex] they
may be,” he said.

Ikeda said she feels more
conﬁdent having women pre-
decessors who have paved the
road for her.

As associate dean, she said
a huge role she will be fulﬁll-
ing is that of a listener.

“What is important to me
is not only bringing the per-
spectives of women to the
table, but also to tap into
more diverse viewpoints rep-
resented on campus for men
and women,” she said.

Despite the controversy,
Mayock said she is pleased
with the overall progress of
W&L through the nine years
she has been on campus.

“I have seen a lot of prog-
ress. I’ve been here a full nine
years. I credit hiring more
women, the women’s studies
program and bringing the en-
rollment of men and women
to parity.”

Beckley is optimistic in
terms of increasing women in
the administration.

“It’s my belief that the
W&L administration, as it
seeks a new Provost and new
deans within the next few
years will do everything [it]
can to recruit qualiﬁed fe-
males and do everything [it]
can to make them feel wel-
come,” he said.

“I anticipate we will have
a woman in one or more of
these positions in four to ﬁve
years or earlier.”

Sewing up controversy

Bizzare Kathekon interviews raise questions about alumni intent

By Jacob Geiger and
Jesslca Shaw
NEWS EDITOR AND STAFF WRITER

Students are raising questions
about the tactics used in Kathek-
on interviews.

According to several students
who went through the process a
few weeks ago, these were not or-
dinary interviews.

“It’s people that come into a
room, and you get asked some
goofy questions,” Kathekon mem-
ber Walker Williams said. “Some
questions are geared towards how
you would act around alumni,
how much you know about the
school and how much you care
about the school.”

Some applicants said they
knew that these interviews would
be unusual while others said they
were caught off guard.

“It’s not testing what you think
you’re going to be interviewed
about,” a new member said.

One applicant, who asked to
remain anonymous, described her
interview.

“I was standing on a stool danc-
ing, and I had to seduce a copy
machine. I wasn’t uncomfortable,
but I could see how it would make
others uncomfortable.”

The applicant said the inter-
view was designed to be intimi-
dating.

“This guy pretended to be a
drunk alum, and I had to sit in his
lap, and I had to say how I would
make him happy.”

Tripp Onnen, advisor to Kath-
ekon, said the the interviews are
designed to measure a candidate’s
ability to handle tough questions
from alumni.

“You get the odd question
about co-education or the speak-
ing tradition,” Onnen said. “You
get questions from people who
haven’t been back in ﬁve years or
haven’t been back in 20 years and
say ‘show me what’s new.’”

When asked about the anony-
mous students’ statements, On-
nen said he found the applicants’
statements “a little surprising.”

“I can’t speak to that,” he said.
“I did my best to monitor those
interviews.”

Kathekon President Olivia
Mansﬁeld said she tailored her
questions to each individual.

“I’d only ask silly questions
to someone I knew,” she said. “I
wouldn’t ask people if I didn’t
know them or what they were
comfortable with; it comes back
to the all important situations you
ﬁnd yourself in. You have to be
diplomatic and responsible.”

Many new members declined
to answer any questions about the
process.

“They told us we weren’t al-

difficult to have resources there
quickly,” Ellestad said.

“In a normal situation with the
river we have some good local re-
sources, but none of that mattered
in this situation,” he said.

“If there was a rescue squad ﬁve
minutes away it wouldn’t have
mattered because the boy was
dead just a few minutes after he
went over the dam.”

In July of 2003 a local ﬁsher-
man also drowned in the Maury
River near J ordan’s Point.

Two local children drowned
upstream of the dam in August of
2004 after jumping out of a tree
into the river.

Despite these incidents, there
are no signs around Jordan’s Point
warning swimmers of the danger
the dam poses.

Crowder estimated the current
was ﬂowing at 12 knots when the
boys jumped into the water.

He also estimated that the wa-
ter was as "much as ten ‘feet deep
directly underneath the dam.

“The only signs up,” Lt.
Crowder said, “are what the city
put up to prohibit people from
jumping out of that tree the two
kids jumped out of.”

Crowder said the tree the two
boys jumped out of in 2004 is lo-
cated on the river’s north bank.

The tree has branches that ex-
tend out over the river.

The park and playing ﬁelds at
Jordan’s Point are located on the
south bank.

“Water’s a wonderful rec-
reational resource,” Lexington
Vice Mayor Tim Golden said.
“If you have water people are go-
ing to get into it.” Golden said he
thought the City Council would
discuss the idea of putting up
signs.

“No, we don’t have any signs
up there,” Ellestad said. “I’d
anticipate this will be a point of
discussion.”

member Ted Williams said.
Though some of the appli-
cants were uncomfortable with
the process, most of them agreed
that Kathekon is different from

Harvey said these
instuctions were deliv-
ered at a meeting after
the interview process
was complete.

Mansﬁeld said
Kathekon was like
most organizations
on campus wanting to
maintain conﬁdential-
ity with its interviews.
However, she said
that members were
not forbidden from talking about
their interview.

“No one has ever been told
‘don’t say anything ever, don’t
talk about Kathekon,’ she said.
“We’ve been on a big PR cam-
paign this year to educate people
on what Kathekon is. We had
Speak Day in the fall and are hav-
ing another one this spring.”

Mansﬁeld, Onnen and other
members stressed that the inter-
views try to gauge how students

would react in awkward situa-

tions with alumni.

process is telling of how a can-
didate would perform under cer-
tain circumstances during Alumni

Academy since 1982 and was
chairman of that board from
1997 until 2005.

Both Gambill and Balentine
have plenty of business experi-
ence as well.

Gambill was the CEO and
president of Baird Electric
Company for 32 years.

“They have good business
acumen,” Norwood said, “and
the ﬁnancial side of the school
is really a big part of our respon-
sibility. A business background
is a plus but not a requirement
for board members.”

Balentine was chairman and
CEO of an investment consult-
ing company that he helped co-
found. The ﬁrm, which began
in 1987, was acquired by anoth-
er company in 2002.

“Balentine built and ran a
large business,” he said.

Balentine, who served as a
co-chair of the Mock Conven-
tion Planning Committee and
was a member of Phi Delta
Theta while at W&L, addressed
what he said were some of the
issues facing the board.

“One thing is completion
of the strategic plan that we’ve
been looking at the last few
years,” he said.

Balentine said he thinks new
President Ken Ruscio will be
heavily involved in the imple-
mentation of the plan.

“As the ﬁnishing touches are
put on, Ken will have his ﬁnger-
prints on [the plan],” Balentine
said.

Balentine also addressed
the role of the Greek system at
W&L the university.

“The Greek system has cer-
tainly been an integral part
of W&L... it will evolve and
change with the times.”

The majority of the members
of the board are alumni, Nor-
wood said, although it is not a
requirement.

“W&L has a wonderful
alumni network that shares a
common bond and culture” Bal-
entine said. “The friendships
and business relationships that
are formed are very important.
The fact that Ken is an alum-
nus and that alumni are so pas-
sionate will strengthen for the
school.”

When asked to recall a favor-
ite memory of the school, Bal-
entine picked one appropriate
for this time of year.

Admissions dean
clariﬁes statements

To the Editor:

Ordinarily I would not write
to address statements made by an
anonymous author.

I will in this case, however,
because the author, the Concerned
Parent, is known to me and has ap-
parently misunderstood my previ-
ous correspondence with him on
the topic of Washington and Lee’s
admission practices with respect
to legacies, athletes, minority stu-
dents and, indeed, all students. If
I was not misunderstood, then I
have been misrepresented. Either
way, I feel it important to com-
ment.

This winter the Concerned Par-
ent wrote me to question W&L’s
admission practices as they relate
to minority students. His query
included statements reﬂecting
his belief that minority students
admitted to W&L are less quali-
ﬁed than other students who gain
admission.

Further, he tried to bolster this
mistaken belief by citing a brief
conversation we had earlier that
fall, the same one he cites in the
Phi.

Whether he misunderstood our
conversation or sought to mis-

characterize my comments in his
query, I do not know, but his letter
to the Phi last week contains the
same inaccurate account of our
exchange.

This bothers me greatly, be-
cause I wrote him a personal letter
setting the record straight about
what I did and did not say and il-
lustrating that all students admit-
ted to W&L are qualiﬁed for that
distinction.

It appears my letter was too
subtle. Now that the innuendo-
laden statemen, “it is the only
way we can get them in,” has
been incorrectly attributed to me
a second time (and this time pub-
licly), I feel I must be more ex-
plicit: I never said that, nor did
Iimply it.

Further, I did not use the word
“preference” to describe our treat-
ment of any segment of W&L’s
applicant pool. That is his word,
not mine. Instead, I described
that our admission staff weighs
a variety of academic and per-
sonal qualities to decide which
students, among a large group
of well-qualiﬁed applicants, will
gain admission.

It appears the Concerned Par-

ent wishes to concentrate on SAT
scores, yet no college I know of
relies on scores as heavily as he
suggests W&L should.

Such an approach would cer-
tainly guarantee higher test scores
in our student body, among all
demographics, but it would also
ensure myriad unfulﬁlled enroll-
ment priorities and, most likely, a
dismal social environment lack-
ing the characteristic richness that
has made W&L a life-changing
experience for generations of stu-
dents.

Strong as W&L is, in my view
there is still room to improve it.
Each of us has a role to play in
that pursuit.

My own is to continue work-
ing to attract and enroll an ever
broader student population, one
that contains as wide a range of
talents, perspectives and aspira-
tions as possible. Every single
member of the W&L family has
a mark to leave, and every single
student admitted to W&L was
chosen because of their potential
to do so.

Jonathan A. Webster

Associate Dean of Admissions

To the Editor:

The letter from the Con-
cerned Parent that appeared in
the April 24 edition of the Ring-
tum Phi troubles me deeply be-
cause it implies that our African-
American and Hispanic students
are unqualiﬁed.

Additionally, the writer de-
mands evidence that will prove
his point. The Afn'can-Ameri-
can student population is both
hurt and insulted by the letter as
well they should be. This attack
on their academic ability is un-
fair and unwarranted.

The letter is also unfair to
Washington and Lee adminis-
trators and admissions officers
because it contends that they
are both unfair and devious.
More important, the letter tends
to drive a wedge into our com-
munity in an attempt to raise the
contentious issue of aﬂirmative
action as it casts aspersions on
both school policy and students.

I cannot pretend to have in-
side information on W&L ad-
missions policies because I do
not.

Yet, no one knows any better
than me how slowly racial prog-
ress came to southern colleges in
general and W&L in particular.

My earliest afﬁliation with
this university was in 1963 when
I was a few months shy of my
twentieth birthday. The only
places for African-Americans at
W&L in 1963 were dining ser-
vices and janitorial work. The
university did not recruit and ac-
cept its ﬁrst black student (since
John Chavis) until August 1966.
After one year he transferred
to a historically black college.
Forty years later we have only
78 black students in the under-
graduate population.

How can the writer allege
that their presence implies unfair

treatment for white students?

Frankly, I ﬁnd very little dif-
ference between the ability of
the white and black students I
teach. I have strong students
and poor students who belong to
both races.

Allow me to share a little of
my own academic history.

I became a full time W&L
student in 1983 at age 40. I had
graduated from a segregated
high school in 1961, and my SAT
scores were very old when I en-
tered. They were also irrelevant
because I had been a part time
W&L student for three years be-
ginning in 1980, and used those
courses to prove my ability.

I graduated in 1985 with a
GPA of 3.375 for which I make
no apologies.

During those years I was
husband, father, PTA president,
treasurer of the Rockbridge Re-
gional Library, secretary of the
Board of Elections, a member of
the Rockbridge Mental Health
Clinic Board, a member of St.
Patrick Catholic Church pastoral
council and a member of a host
of other organizations. Com-
munity service was dear to my
heart, and I studied hard.

W&L took a chance on me,
and I refuse to believe that my
own admission kept a single
more deserving white student
out of the college. Today I have
a Ph.D. and am a member of the
faculty.

I feel strongly about the

worthiness of every potential
student to earn a W&L degree.
And guess what! W&L has
never limited admission to SAT
scores and grade point aver-
ages——not even during the Jim
Crow Era. Would you want to
be a student at this university if
everyone was a study “geek?” If
W&L ever limits admissions to
academic achievement only, so-
cial life will drastically change.
Think about it!

I am also troubled that the
Ring-tum Phi does not share the
same policy as most profession-
al newspapers—not to publish
anonymous letters.

I have the moral courage
to own everything I write, and
others should do the same or
refrain from entering public fo-
rums. Unfortunately, the edi-
tors also bear responsibility for
anonymous letters and readers
can rightly assume that the Con-
cerned Parent’s views reﬂect
those of the Ring-tum Phi—as
much as I hope that is not true.
It is a university newspaper for
all members of the W&L com-
munity including Hispanic and
African American students.

Student responds to parent

Senior says admissions department should continue to look beyond test scores

To the Editor:

I am very concerned about
Washington and Lee University.

After four years of being a stu-
dent here, I am conﬁdent we have
made strides in the right direction
when it comes to diversity, multi-
culturalism and gender relations,
but it worries and saddens me to
read letters like the one sent by a
Concerned Parent to the Phi last
week.

Among other things, the parent
in question seems to believe it is
unfair that the Admissions Office
encourages minority students to
apply by offering them exclusive
incentives that are not offered to
majority candidates.

In my opinion, if there has
been a historical disparity in the
proportion of applications re-
ceived from particular groups (as
measured against their share of
the general population, or as mea-
sured against application numbers
at other comparable institutions)
then there is a presumption that
the school has not been marketing
itself to those groups. The Admis-
sions Oﬂice, therefore, is simply
making efforts to correct that his-
torical error. Please note that this
is a marketing effort; it is not the
same as actually admitting a stu-
dent simply because he or she is
a minority.

In fact, the parent her/him-
self quoted several admissions
ofﬁcers as saying that minority
students at W&L are as academi-
cally qualiﬁed as their major-

ity counterparts, and that race is
only considered when “separating
equals,” much like athletic ability
or legacy status would give an ap-
plicant an edge only when he or
she is as academically qualiﬁed as
the other students seeking admit-
tance.

Now, this parent seems to be-
lieve that minority students can-
not possibly be as academically
qualiﬁed as their counterparts
because, statistically, their SAT
scores are likely to be lower than
majority students’ scores. He or
she thinks that the admissions of-
ﬁce cannot possibly be “separat-
ing equals” when it is likely that
SAT scores for black students are
more than 100 points below SAT
scores for whites.

Sir or Madam, I hope you
understand that SAT scores and
even GPAs are not the deﬁnitive
yardstick by which we hope to
measure prospective students’
ability. Some students from dis-
advantaged backgrounds, from
marginalized communities or
from difiicult home circumstanc-
es have overcome obstacles that
students from more comfortable
backgrounds may never even
have imagined.

A reasonable case can be made
that a student who has come a
long way, overcoming numer-
ous obstacles and disadvantages,
but with slightly lower numbers,
is of equal or greater merit than
another student who has led an
entirely privileged life. A reason-

able case could similarly be made
that the disadvantaged student
has an equal or greater potential
to succeed at the school than a
privileged applicant with oth-
erwise slightly higher numbers.
Judgments of this sort are hard
to make, require great care and
beneﬁt from the lessons of expe-
rience

The admissions process should
be holistic, looking at the entire
candidate’s ﬁle in the context of
the incoming class as a whole.
It is an art; otherwise, machines
would do it.

It is the Admissions Ofﬁce’s

responsibility to admit an inter-

esting, thoughtful, diverse and
academically qualiﬁed incom-
ing class that will bring credit to
the school by its commitment to
learning, and, later, by its accom-
plishments in as wide a variety
of ﬁelds, endeavors and locales
as is possible. The class should
be as diverse as possible in every
way—along class, ethnic, racial,
national and geographic lines, as
well as in terms of the disciplin-
ary and extracurricular interests
that they are likely to bring to the
school.

By doing this, the Admissions
Office not only creates a more
interesting and educational envi-
romnent for current students, but
also increases the value of stu-
dents’ diplomas (if you want the
economic argument) by creating
future networking opportunities
and enhancing the school’s repu-

tation.There is another reason
why minority recruitment “is nec-
essary to enrich the educational
experience of all.”

W&L is both an academic in-
stitution and a community. The
greater the diversity of our stu-
dent body, the richer the environ-
ment in which students will ﬁnd
themselves as they grow into
adulthood.

For many, this will be the ﬁrst
time they encounter people very
much like themselves in some
ways (academic aptitude, commit-
ment to learning), but very differ-
ent from them in others, whether
it be in terms of ethnic, national,
cultural or religious backgrounds,
or of disciplinary or extracurricu-
lar interests.

I realize that this letter could
go on for pages, so I will stop
now and just say this: to suggest
that thereshould be an end to the
promotion of diversity at W&L,
to suggest that the careful con-
siderations of merit and promise
of each and every candidate be
cast aside, and that the growth in
geographic, social and disciplin-
my reach of W&L’s reputation
be stunted—all for the sake of
a few index numbers—is short-
sighted, extreme and certainly not
in the best interests of the school,
its student body or your son or
daughter.

THE RING-TUM PHI '

  editor

Dean sets
record straight

To the Editor:

I would like to set the record
straight. All Washington and Lee
students are qualiﬁed to be here
or they would not have been ad-
mitted.

No concession in admissions
standards has been made to enroll
any students.

If one looks at all the elements

The overwhelming num-
ber of students at Wash-
ington and Lee with a
demonstrated need are
provided assistance re-
gardless of race, gender

or ethic background
 

of the admissions process in their
totality (grades, test scores, es-
say, recommendations, etc.), our
minority students are every bit as
qualiﬁed as the rest of the student
body.

Our goal of increasing the
number of minority candidates
with credentials appropriate to
our student body has brought
to our community students who
have excelled in the classroom
and enriched the university in ex-
tra- and co-curricular life.

Since it has been implied that

minority students take ﬁnancial
aid away from other students, it
is important to state unequivo-
cally that that is not the case.

The overwhelming number of
students at W&L with a demon-
strated need are provided assis-
tance regardless of race, gender
or ethic background.

Twenty years ago, women
students became an integral part
of undergraduate life at W&L.

Just as there is no question
now of the wisdom and ben-
eﬁt to W&L of co—education,
the same is true of our efforts to
bring more diversity of thought
and experience to the W&L stu-
dent body.

A classroom and a commu-
nity with varied experiences and
backgrounds is a better learning
space than one made up of a ho-
mogeneous population. We be-
lieve in the wisdom of a diverse
university community and will
continue to embody that belief
in policy.

We at W&L grow socially
and intellectually because of the
diverse contributions of every
single student on campus, with-
out exception.

Beckley responds
to parent’s letter

To the Editor:

Dean Bill Hartog states the
policy of our Admissions Oﬂice
in his letter in this issue of the
Ring-tum Phi.

My statement that follows
afﬁrms and reinforces our total
commitment to that policy.

Washington and Lee recruits
only applicants who possess the
intellectual capacity, talent and
skills to ﬂourish academically
and contribute to the vibrancy
of our educational community.

We admit only the most
qualiﬁed among these appli-
cants considering all criteria for
admission.

These criteria include grades,
test scores, personal essays, rec-
ommendations and a variety of
attributes that indicate the ap-
plicants will thrive at W&L and
contribute to the community.

We seek students ﬁom a va-
riety of backgrounds and with a
wide array of skills, intellectual
specialties and interests.

Some of these students are
racial minorities, from urban
public high schools, from dif-
ferent nations or from families
with meager ﬁnancial means.

Some of them are athletes,
musicians, actors or artists.

Others display promise to be
government leaders or service
leaders. These students are from
Virginia, California, Maine and
Texas.

Some will study science and
others will study philosophy,
history, journalism or business.

All of these groups are wel-

come at W&L and are quali-
ﬁed not merely to survive but
to thrive.

The combination of all of
these groups of students make
us a richer moral and intellec-
tual community.

We actively recruit students
from these groups and others in
order to maintain a community
and educational environment
that will prepare all of our stu-
dents to contribute to the world
in which they will live.

We deplore and renounce
recent insinuations in letters
to the Ring-tum Phi that some
W&L students are less deserv-
ing of an education here than
others.

We are proud that a student
like Ligia Abreu, whose letter
is published in this issue of
the Phi, was attracted to come
from a middle class family in
Santo Domingo to W&L.

Abreu is the Head Dorrni-‘

tory Counselor this year and
will attend Yale Law School in
September.

She is not alone among our
students of color.

They, and students from
other groups, make our univer-
sity a better place.

We will continue to recruit
and welcome applicants from
many different groups whose
character, talents and academic
credentials qualify them to
contributeto W&L and to so-
ciety. '

Harlan Beckley
Acting President

We deplore and renounce recent insinu-

ations in letters to the Ring-tum Phi that

some Washington and Lee students are less

deserving of an education here than others.

 

Let’s address journalistic
professionalism.

True: most newspapers
outside of alternative weekly
publications refuse to print
anonymous letters to the edi-
tor.

Most newspapers don’ op-
erate in a culture of fear. ’

Make no mistake, we ha /e
the First Amendment here,
but the community is either
too scared or too lazy to ex-
ercise it.

When one submits their
opinion to a newspaper, they
are using one of the most pure
and basic American rights.

They are also entering the
public forum.

This means that they
should also represent them-
selves truthfully, if they ex-
pect to be trusted.

But the people who write
letters to newspapers are gen-
erally part of the active com-
munity in which the newspa-
per is distributed.

The Phi editors recognized
last week’s Concerned Parent
letter as one that would rufﬂe
feathers on campus.

The man who wrote the
letter does not live on campus,
and is not obligated to have
any form of daily interaction
with its citizens.

His daughter,
does.

His daughter would be the
person forced to deal with the
feedback from this letter.

With this in mind, the Phi
agreed to respect his request
for anonymity.

We also printed every re-
sponse to his letter in this
week’s issue.

As stated every week in our
staff box, the opinions printed
in letters to the editor are not
the opinions of Phi staff mem-
bers.

however,

st tfeditorial
Newspaper and community

Phi defends right of Concerned Parent to express opinion in open forum

If you don’t believe us,
look over at page four and
read the box for yourselves.

We reserve the right to print
anything a reader sends—so
long as we present it to the
community honestly, the way
we received it.

But presenting something
honestly is far from endorsing
it, as several readers have sug-
gested. '

It is disappointing and in-
sulting that several commu-
nity members have accused
the Phi staff of composing the
letter ourselves.

It is not uncommon for
parents and alumni to include
the Phi in their conversations
with the administration.

It is our right and duty to
print these conversations in an
open forum.

The Concerned Parent let-
ter is no different.

The Phi is available inthe
most non-discriminatory way
possible on campus: it’s free.

And each student, parent,
faculty member, staff mem-
ber and alumnus/alumna has
the right to read it and submit
a letter commenting on their
community.

The Phi does not see along
race lines, or divide the stu-
dent body into socioeconomic
groups.

If we did that, we would be
dividing ourselves.

As Professor DeLaney
points out in his letter this
week, we are a publication for
everyone in the Washington
and Lee community, includ-
ing students from many back-
grounds and many countries.

Outside of ethnic diversity,
the Phi is also representative
of students from different eco-
nomic groups.

Also included in this com-
munity of readers are the par-

ents, who are just as entitled
to their opinions and have the
same rights to voice them.

If you disagree with the
Concerned Parent, we wel-
come you to stand up and say
so, as six readers have.

It is the opinion of this edi-
torial board that not enough of
you care.

Too often, W&L students
look the other way and ig-
nore issues that drastically af-
fect your lives. It is easier to
worry about your grades than
to try and address the deep is-
sues that come with attending
a largely homogenous college
in rural Virginia.

Recently, the Phi has print-
ed letters to the editor sup-
porting the Posse program.

We have also run two sto-
ries covering the campus’s
positive response to minority
recruitment initiatives.

The Phi ﬁrst entered this
debate on Feb. 27 with our
staff editorial on the Posse
program.

But now, when we run a
letter showing a dissenting
opinion, the community is
outraged.

Be fair. The Concerned
Parent’s opinion may repre-
sent a certain section of the
Washington and Lee popula-
tion.

If he does not, as the many
response letters suggest, then
the Phi has simply served its
purpose as a forum.

If we were to only print our
opinion, and censor everyone
else’s, then we would be a pro-
paganda machine, no different
than the ofﬁcial newspapers
of the Chinese government.

The editors of the Phi do
not decide right and wrong.

We do not decide whether
these admissions policies are
worth the ﬁnancial initiatives,
and we do not determine the
worth of each student admit-
ted.

That job is left up to you,
the citizen.

The Phi serves merely as a
place where everyone can dis-
cuss it publicly.

One of the most beautiful
features of newspapers is the
microphone they provide to
the everyday citizen.

They provide a place where
not only public officials, but
also any caring citizen, can
come forward and be repre-
sented.

One citizen did just that--
and his right to speak up has
been summarily attacked.

We will not allow that
to happen. We will not take
sides.

Represent yourselves in
this discussion—write letters.

Care, and don’t take of-
fense when someone else who
cares disagrees with you. We
are begging you.

The above represents the
majority opinion of the edito-
rial staﬂ of the Ring-tum Phi.

Senior offers views on admissions

To the Editor:

I would like to respond to a
letter written by a Concerned
Parent in last week’s issue of
the Phi.

This anonymous contributor
opposes preferential admissions
practices based on any criteria
other than ‘merit,’ which the
author implicitly deﬁnes as a
combination of SAT and GPA
scores, though, conspicuously,
they only mention the SAT.

“Unequivocally, if a student
of any race is the best academi-
cally qualiﬁed and merits a po-
sition I salute him...skin color
should not be a factor, one way
or the other.”

If GPA, SAT and perhaps
standard—fare extracurricu-
lars were the only valid basis
for evaluation of candidates,
wouldn’t each new class appear
exceedingly dull and uniform?

The fact is, as a private insti-
tution, it is the university’s pre-
rogative to compose each class
as it sees ﬁt, employing what-
ever criteria it wants.

Does anyone really want a
class picked from the top 1,200
SAT scores out of the 3,900 ap-
plications received?

Some might say, “yes, obvi-
ously,” but for those of us who
can still clearly recall the na-
ture of that test, I should hope
the answer is, “no, obviously.”
Why?

bilities, and leaves out many
that are relevant to succeeding
in college and in life.

Moreover, richer people can
prepare for it better — not only
through many years of superior
schooling, but also through ex-
pensive preparation courses,
and even, in some cases, per-
sonal coaches.

The Concerned Parent men-
tions a personal visit by Jona-
than Webster, Associate Dean of
Admissions, to Glenelg Coun-
try School, a private institution
with which the parent is (pre-
sumably) connected.

Firstly, I cannot help but
point out that a Dean of Admis-
sions from W&L did not visit
my high school — presumably
Glenelg enjoys a closer relation-
ship to W&L than most of the
high schools represented here.

One can only imagine the
beneﬁt Glenelg’s reputation
confers in the admissions pro-
cess.

The concerned parent men-
tions their high school sopho-
more.

Does this child attend Gle-

nelg?

Will they enjoy the beneﬁts
of intense and expensive SAT
preparation?

The parent advises that the
Posse Foundation’s proposal (to
admit a group of intercity stu-
dents using special, unconven-
tional criteria) should be “sum-
marily rejected.”

Does the parent mean that
this proposal should be rejected
out of hand, without being given
serious consideration?

Why should we take the par-
ent’s concerns seriously, if they
reﬁrse to entertain alternative
views on admissions criteria?

Presumably, the parent would
profess that they intend a ‘true
meritocracy. ’

Surely this entails ‘need
blind’ admissions, since ability
to pay is not a component of
academic merit.

But the availability of the
early decision option is directly
contradictory to the spirit of
need—blind admissions policies.

Why?

Because only very rich peo-
ple can comfortably commit to

a college before getting a ﬁnan-
cial aid package.

Poorer students are explic-
itly discouraged from applying
early decision.

‘Full-pays’ are at an advan-
tage in the admissions process,
and this is the best-kept secret
of the ‘need-blind’ admissions
lie.

Early decision is a thinly dis-
guised means for the rich to tele-
graph their ﬁnancial strength to
the university, even while ﬁnan-
cial documents are ostensibly
kept separate.

The fact is, I suspect this par-
ent would like to see the Posse
Foundation ‘summarily reject-
ed’ because they are worried
one of the Posse members might
‘take’ their child’s spot.

Moreover, I would suggest
their supposed indicators of ‘real
merit’ are precisely those which
people in their social position
have succeeded in mastering.

One-hundred points on the
SAT costs $1200.

That is the going rate.

This parent feels threatened
by alternative schemes of candi-
date evaluation; let them be.

Do they have W&L’s best
interests at heart, or their own
self-interest?

Let us reafﬁrrn our universi-
ty’s right to compose each class
as it sees ﬁt, and not be a slave
to a narrow set of criteria.

Remembrance of things past

An event-ﬁlled weekend awaits alumni who make the journey back to their alma mater

Alumni from across the country return to W&L

to reunite with friends, reminisce about the past

and attend events and parties. While changes

have taken place since they left, they plan to

revisit favorite places and people.

STAFF wn ITER

It is that time of year when
the green lawn invites people to
lie on it and alumni swarm the
campus for one glorious week-
end to relive old memories.

Honoring the graduates of
1951 to 2001, the weekend offi-
cially starts today with activities
planned for the Class of 1971.

For some, the trip will be
mixing business with plea-
sure. The spring meeting of the
Alumni Board of Directors will
continue through the weekend.

Special tours will be given to
highlight the changes the cam-
pus has undergone, especially
the introduction of women to
Washington and Lee.

One female alumna said she
was grateful for the school’s
recognition of the choice to go
co-ed.

With both an M.A. and a
Ph.D. from Princeton Univer-
sity, there is no question that
Professor Marc Conner is a
force to be reckoned with in
the classroom.

He is a force to be reckoned
with in the realm of martial
arts as well.

Professor Conner has been
involved in different forms
of martial arts for the past 15
years.

He has obtained two ﬁrst-
degree black belts and one sec-

Master H. David Clements,
Conner’s Karate Master at an
Amherst, Va. karate school,
reported that only one in 1,000
Karate students move on to
achieve the black belt, accord-
ing to a Washington and Lee
press release.

Conner’s accomplishments
are not easy to achieve. In
Master Clements’s career he
has only awarded about 20
second- degree black belts.

Conner asserted that the
challenge of receiving his
black belt was made easier for
him by his love of learning.

Seven years ago, Profes-
sor Conner began his karate
career.

Karate is his favorite of
the martial arts forms he has

a part of a minority in any way,”
said Shelley Milligan, co-chair
for the Class of 1996.

Any strain felt by the female
students then came not from
their male counterparts but from
the women previously bussed
in.

“There was still a bit of ten-
sion between W&L women and
those from neighboring women’s
colleges who would visit Lex-
ington during the weekends,”
said Milligan, who worked at
W&L after graduating.

“I think that the inﬂuence of
women from nearby places was
pretty much gone from W&L by
the early 2000s. Sure, some still
visited, but not in the masses
that they came during my fresh-
man year, for example.”

A presentation in Lee Chapel
on Friday will be about the his-
tory of coeducation. At the pre-
sentation will be John Delane
Wilson, the president of W&L
from 1983-1995, who oversaw

mastered because of the phi-
losophy behind it and the dis-
cipline it requires.

“It is nice to study the East-
em arts because my teach-
ing is focused on the Western
world,” said Conner.

He is accomplished with
many weapons including bow
staffs, nunchucks, knives and
swords.

Self-defense is also a part
of the martial arts.

Professor Conner is ca-
pable of defending himself
against attackers who come at
him by hand, with knives and
even with guns.

His skills are demonstrat-
ed in exhibitions and competi-
tions.

Karate is also a hobby that
Conner shares with his fam-
ily. He has three sons, two of
which are already involved in
karate.

When he is no longer phys-
ically able to practice karate,
he sees himself returning to
his previous hobbies of car-
pentry and ﬂy-ﬁshing.

Conner said, “As I became
more involved with martial
arts, I gave up my other hob-
bies because I knew martial
arts would be a hobby I could
do with my children.”

Now Professor Conner is
also a karate instructor, which
allows him to spend even more
time with his sons.

Since he is an easygo-
ing professor, most students
would not guess that Conner
has the ability to break boards
or wield nunchucks.

Teaching English to college
students and teaching karate to
younger students has its simi-
larities and its differences.

Conner said, “There is a
good distinction between the
two. Teaching here is deﬁnite-
ly my passion, even though I
can’t make English students
do push-ups.”

Also in attendance will be
Jenny Stratton, the first female
president of the Alumni Board
of Directors and a member of
the ﬁrst class of women.

Alumni can roam the cam-
pus, participate in any of the
college’s many open houses, or
even learn a foreign language in
mini, 20-minute classes.

For those who arrive late,
a barbeque bash at Zollman’s
for the six most recent reunion
classes will be the ﬁrst chance
to catch up on life changes. The
party will continue as the band
Right On provides entertain-
ment.

“For some reason, no matter
how far removed we get from
W&L, Zollman’s is always a
draw,” said Milligan.

For those who awake early,
Acting President Harlan Beck-
ley will be at a breakfast in Ev-
ans Dining Hall. The new presi-
dent, Ken Ruscio, who is also
celebrating his thirtieth reunion,
will be the breakfast’s special
guest.

Following the breakfast,
Milligan and Margaret “Kippie”
Griffin will receive the school’s
Distinguished Young Alumna
Award.

Given to alumni who have
shown service and loyalty to
the school and community, the
award was meant to recognize

Conner demonstrates the skills that enabled him to test for and acquire his

the extraordinary young alumni
for their achievements.

Many of the people traveling
to W&L this weekend are not
only coming for their memories
but because of their commit-
ment to the school.

“The people coming are all
the people that I would have
expected to come,” said Townes
Pressler, co-chair for the Class
of 1986. “Most were very in-
volved with the school when we
were there and stay involved.”

Over the years, classmates
have spread out all over the na-
tion, but Pressler said the dis-
tance will not make a difference
in the numbers attending.

“The ones that were commit-
ted when we were in school are
still committed,” he said. “I do
not think that a three—hour ﬂight
is much different than a three-
hour drive for the others.”

Milligan agreed that other
life factors would be why some
alumni would not come back.

“It’s a busy season for many
of us, some with young chil-
dren, demanding jobs, etc,” she
said. “Most everyone I’ve talk-
ed to wants to come back, but
for some it’s just not feasible at
this point.”

The draw may be seeing
friends for some alumni, but for
others, it is the school and the

memories it holds.

“I think what I remember
most fondly is the way W&L
fosters community,” said Mil-
ligan. “I loved faculty who
declared that their spring term
class met on the Colonnade un-
der a certain tree, and if it was
raining, no class.I loved mid-
night breakfast breaks in the
D-hall during exam week. . .‘I
loved special events like Fancy
Dress, Mock Convention and
all the great speakers that would
come.”

“In general, I look back on
those four years so fondly and
hope that today’s students are
enjoying all that W&L oﬁers.”

THE RING-TUM PHI ' 7

On Sunday a group of Washington and Lee students
attended the Rally to Stop Genocide In Washington, D.C.
The purpose of the rally was to encourage the govern-
ment to take steps to Improve the situation In Darfur
and to express concern over the human rights violations
occurring in the Sudan.

This area has been a region of turmoil for years, but
in 2003, the situation grew dire. Rebel groups began to
ﬁght against the government-backed mllltla. The mllltla
has invaded civilian areas, killing, raping and looting.

Over 400,000 people have died in Darfur thus far, and
2.5 million nationals have been displaced.

“Seelng so many people come out to support this
cause was so energizing and has given me more hope to-

ward the horrible situation In Sudan. Hopefully President
Bush, congress and the UN will be pushed to take more
action, and fast," said sophomore Katie carmody who
organized the group of students who attended the rally.

Although this problem takes place thousands of miles
from campus, students believe that it is our problem as
well.

carmody said, “i’d like to see our campus participate
In more activist activities. We are in the prime years to
make a difference locally, nationally and Internationally,
and It is the results of the actions we take now that will
ultimately help shape our own futures and the future of
our children.”

W&L dancers perform with local
high school students and alumnae

While the Varied

troupe members make
scheduling rehersals
diﬁicult, the diversity
of the dancers adds
variety to their perfor-

By Julie Petersen
STAFF WRITER

The lights go out. The techno
beat starts to pound. Suddenly a
whirlwind of black lights, glow
sticks and tap shoes attacks the
audience as the dance begins.

And that’s just one of the acts.

Last weekend, the Washing-
ton and Lee Dance Companies
thrilled audiences with their an-
nual Spring Concert.

The decade-themed produc-
tion featured pieces from many
areas of music, drawing on many
musical styles including classical,
modern, techno, Broadway and
oldies.

The show featured both profes-
sional and student choreographed
pieces from all genres of dance.

Senior Mary Christopher and
sophomore Julia Pieasants even
managed to choreograph one
dance with two alumnae via e-
mail and video, not actually re-
hearsing the dance together until
a few days before the show.

This year’s concert has pre-
sented some unique challenges for
the dancers due to a change in the
performance location. With the
Lenfest Center’s Keller Theater
reserved for another production,
the dancers were forced to move
the concert to the smaller John-
son Theater, sometimes called the
“black-box theater.”

Though the smaller stage re-
quired some choreography adjust-

‘ ments, the girls have been able to

cope with the changes and utilize
the theater’s unique style to their
advantage.

“The Johnson Theater is a lot
more interactive,” Christopher
said. “lt’s a lot more fun, a lot
more playful and you really can
feed olf the audience a lot more
because you’re on the same level
with them.”

The company also chose to
have more performances to com-
pensate for a smaller audience
seating area.

Because the W&L Ballet
Company rehearses with Shenan-
doah Dance Academy, a local
dance studio, these dancers get
the unique experience of working
with local high school students as
well as their college friends.

Several of the conce1t’s ballet
pieces featured area high school
seniors along with the W&L com-
pany.

Sophomore Alice Shih sees
these local students as an asset to
the program.

“I think ﬁrst of all it’s great
for W&L because W&L students
don't tend to reach out much to
the community or be part of the
community as much,” Shih said.
“But this really allows us to get
to know people outside of W&L.
It’s a great way to get to know
other people, especially younger
kids.”

Though switching theaters cre-
ated some confusion, the greatest
obstacle the show faced was sim-

ply coordinating everyone’s busy
schedules.

The dancers are involved in a
myriad of clubs, sororities, and
projects, not to mention their di-
verse academic interests, and this
diversity leads to a scheduling
nightmare.

With four years of schedule
juggling under her belt, senior
Elizabeth Little knows about last-
minutes rehearsals, saying, “It’s
hard to get everybody together to
rehearse. I didn’t think we were
going to have everybody until the
show.”

While the differing interests of
the women make scheduling for
rehersals problematic, this dif-
ficulty is also the strength of the
dance program.

The vast diversity of women in
the program is perhaps its greatest
asset.

For sophomore Blaire Mon-
roe, dance has been a unifying
activity, bringing together a wide
array of students.

“It’s not a set type of girl,”
Monroe said. “That’s what I enjoy
about it. It’s diﬂ°erent from being
in a sorority or a club.

We’re all interested in dance,
but it brings together a variety of
different ages and backgrounds.”

The variety of the dancers’ past

“Its not a set type of
girl. That is what I
enjoy about dance].
It is dzﬂerent from be-
ing in a sorority or a
club. We ’re all inter-
ested in dance, but it
brings together a vari-
ety of dzﬂerent ages

and backgrounds. ”

BLAIRE MONROE,
class of 2008

training also lends to the unique-
ness of the company.

Students come from a wide ar-
ray of dance backgrounds, rang-
ing from no previous experience
to a lifetime of training.

Pieasants was even raised in
an artist colony in nearby Am-
herst, Va.

“It’s really fun to have these
girls who are strictly hip—hop
dancers dancing with girls who
are classically ballet and girls
who are Broadway-style tap danc-
ers,” says Christopher. “We have
this one girl this year who belly
dances.”

The dancers emphasize the
group’s welcoming atmosphere
and encourage any interested
persons to attend a rehearsal, ad-
vising any potential members to
watch campus notices for practice
times and locations.

“It’s very open. It’s very re-
laxed. It’s not an intimidating set-
ting at all,” Pieasants said. “We
want people.”

The rich variety of dance
styles, colors, music and lights in
this weekend’s performances was
just another way in which W&L
Dance cultivates diversity on our
campus.

The energy and passion of the
dancers made the concert an event
to be remembered.

“You know what?” Pieasants
said. “We’ve got spirit!”

Alums return to former exploits

hook-ups and general debauchery of yesteryear

Returning to W&L means returning to the parties,

SHE SAID

Spring term is really just one
event, weekend, and party after
another.

Classes are there to break up
the monotony.

On that note, now that all my
professors are cursing the day I
entered their classroom, it’s time
to tackle yet another “she says”
article.

The topic this time around?
Alumni weekend.

All of our favorite alumni,
plus a bunch we would rather not
see again due to sketchy “you’re a
senior and I won’t have to see you
everyday next year” hook ups,
return to lurk around campus and
play student all over again.

So now that they are returning,
what do we, as the lovely ladies
actually attending class here, do
about it?

Do we hook up with the al-
ums?

There are many things you
have to take into consideration
before you tackle this question.

For instance, is he married?
Yeah, that would not be cool.

How about this one: did he
graduate with my dad?

Does he have pictures of his
grandkids in his wallet? Gross.
I don’t even want to write about
this topic anymore. But alas, I
have to continue.

Let’s say he’s a little younger-
like he graduated within the past
decade or maybe even_ this cen-
tury.

Does his mom still tuck him
in?

There is a point when the cost
beneﬁts of living with mom and
dad are totally overshadowed by
the sheer disappointment of it all.

Then it is considered a pity
hook up, which is not a good feel-
ing to wake up with. That, plus
a hangover can almost ruin your
entire weekend.

Also, what if you ﬁnd yourself
really falling for the alumnus who
has caught your eye?

First, I’m just going to assume
he’s age appropriate for my stom-
ach’s sake.

Second I am going to tell you
to forget it.

He is here for the weekend.
That’s it.

He comes once a year to ﬁnd
a girl like you, shotgun way too
many Natty Lights, and return
to the real world to make his co-
workers even more jealous of the
fact that they did not attend Wash-
ington and Lee.

You’re just a water cooler
story— no better or worse than the
discussion of Sunday night’s epi-
sode of Grey’s Anatomy.

Yet there is the lure of the

The darker side
of sunbathing

With bathing suitsea-
son here, tanning is a
popular activity. A&L
Editor Kathryn Krall
gives you the do’s and
don’t’s of laying out.

Don’t expose yourself to the
midday sun. If you are outside
between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., try to
stay in the shade. Laying out for
the purpose of becoming tanned
or burned is nonproductive, bor-
ing, sweaty and, most important-
ly, dangerous.

Don’t count on clothing to
protect you, especially if they
are loose-knit or light-colored.
Clothes are about SPF 30, and
if you burn easily, you can burn
through your clothing.

Don’t ignore your skin type.
A person with red or blonde hair,
blue eyes and freckles burns much
more easily than other skin types.

Don’t use tanning salons.
Many salons exceed the safe limit
of UV rays and can cause an in-
creased chance of cancer. Be-
sides, fake-baking leads to an or-
ange tint that is never attractive.

Do wear sunscreen of at least
SPF 15 if you plan to be in the
sun. Even if you are not laying
out at the beach, daily sun expo-
sure, such as a tennis game or the
walk to freshman parking, can be
risky. Plus, sunscreen smells re-
ally nice.

Do reapply sunscreen every
two hours. Sweat, water and
time erode the lotion and leave
your skin unprotected. Besides
the increasing the chance of skin
cancer, prolonged exposure to
the sun leads to leathery skin and
early wrinkles. Even if you are
willing to sacriﬁce your health
for beauty, you should realize that

tanning will cause your skin will
show signs of premature aging.

Do wear sunglasses that of-
fer 99 percent or 100 percent
UV protection. This ﬁghts sight

I respect and applaud all of the
uninhibited alumni who return to
W&L every year during alumni
weekend to relive their college
glory days.

I’m not referring to the old

This “no hold bars”
feeling feels good after an un-
healthy amount of cocktails on
Friday night, but you have to
make sure it will settle well in
your stomach the next morning.

The alumni are here only one
weekend.

Washington and Lee has be-
come their oasis.

They look forward to this
weekend so why shouldn’t we?

Have fun, live it up, enjoy
yourself, be safe.

Whatever you do this week-

Make sure he is not married. That
would really not be cool.

mediocre job after

college because their 2.9

wasn’t solid enough to get them a
great job after graduating.

Why do I celebrate these ﬁne
men?

Because I am 100 percent
certain that I will be the sketchy
23 year-old returning in 2009
to puke on the frat lawn for old
times and maybe make out with
some chick. . .any chick.

That’s the beauty of alumni
weekend; you can’t get made
fun of by your friends for hook-
ing up with a less—than-attractive
girl because most of them won’t
_be there. , .;

Therefore, when the hard-

working pledge bros with real
jobs call you to ask about the
weekend, you can tell them you
went back to the old stomping
grounds and still brought the A-
game. Legit.

There is no problem with
alumni hooking up who gradu-
ated in the last decade.

It’s when the drunk girl hooks
up with the 36-year-old lawyer
when things get unpleasant.

Yet when a senior frat lord goes
after the MILF and seduces her
with a bottle of cheap wine and
fancy dialect, glory is achieved.

Basically, girls can only harm
their reputation during alumni
weekend while guys can create
awesome stories and obtain awe-
some nicknames.

The aforementioned tale of
mother seduction was achieved
last year by a young alumnus.

This story is the reason that
many freshman boys are extreme-
ly excited to meet the 23 year-old
investment banker (damn, he has
a real job) who will be returning
to campus on Friday to attempt
and conquer alumni weekend
once again.

When people ask about this
legend, they often use this story to
describe his character and immor-
talize him in the alumni weekend
hall of fame.

I can only dream of the day
when I’m teaching eleventh grade
history and coaching JV baseball
and basketball at my old high
school and get to return to W&L

If you're like most Washington & Lee seniors, your college career has been packed with accomplishment
and excitement. Believe it or not, what happens after you graduate can be even better.

to attempt to dominate the campus
as an alumnus. . .because dominat-
ing as an undergrad hasn’t really
worked out.

Nonetheless, all alumni re-
ceive a cloak of coolness when
they return to campus.

I have no idea what the guys
who graduated in 1990 were con-
sidered cool when they went here,
but I imagine they ruled W&L be-
cause of their awesome stories.

These narratives coupled with
super-hyper-mega fratty tattoos
on their ankles made them way
cooler than any current students.

Who knows whether their
stories of buying a huge sling-
shot and ﬁring a rock that went
through the Phi Delt house actu-
ally happened.

The main thing is that I can tell
kids that it did happen in 12 years
when I’m coaching and teaching
at my old high school (lofty aspi-
rations).

The key of alumni weekend is
absolute debauchery. Guys who
hazed you last year and hung
out afterwards are now old and
washed up while you still have a
year or two left of the best years
of your life.

Meanwhile the dudes who
graduated many moons ago can
now bask in their frat glory and
tell stories of their hammered
hey-day.

Come back alumni, you are
missed, and the freshman girls
might not know any better.

Baseball

The W&L baseball team lost its two ﬁrst games of the
ODAC tournament to Bridgewater College (2-6) and
Guilford College (4-5, 11 innings) to end their season at 18-
15-1. In the ﬁrst game, Bridgewater starter Ricky Reed only
allowed a pair of runs through nine innings to pick up the
win. The next day against Guilford, senior outﬁelder Dave
MacKenzie singled home two in the top of the ninth to give
the Generals a 4-3 advantage, but the lead was relinquished
and the squad ended up losing in the bottom of the 11”‘
inning.

Women’s Lacrosse

The Generals cruised to the ODAC championship by
defeating Virginia Wesleyan 13-7. Senior Louisa Feve ended
her ODAC career by scoring 3 goals and accounting for 1
assist in the victory. The Generals are currently ranked tenth
in the country and will learn who they play in the NCAA
tournament on May 7.

Golf

The Generals ﬁnished second in the ODAC, falling to.
defending National Champion Guilford College. The
Generals were led by Freshman Beau Allen who shot two
rounds of 74. Allen was named Co—Rookie of the Year in the
ODAC, while teammate Nathaniel James was named ODAC
player of the year and Anthony Zappin received ODAC Golf
Scholar Athlete of the Year honors.

Lax falls to Roanoke

Loss in ODAC tournament marks the close of a disappointing season for men

By Madeline Gent
surr warren

A disappointing loss to arch-
rival Roanoke College ended the
men’s lacrosse season yesterday.

They went into the game with

_ high hopes.

With a win over the Randolph-
Macon College Yellow Jackets,
the Washington and Lee men’s
lacrosse team secured themselves
a spot in playoffs.

The Generals opened their
week with a night game against
their neighbors, the VMI Key-
dets, in the nineteenth annual
Lee-Jackson lacrosse classic.

The Generals secured their win
with a strong second quarter, out-
scoring the Keydets 3-0 as well
as a stellar performance from the
game’s MVP, goalie Chris Lalli.

The Keydets took an early 4-1
lead with a little over six minutes
left in the ﬁrst quarter. They were
led by two assists and a goal from
sophomore Kevin Hill. Hill ﬁn-
ished the game with four goals

and two assists and is the VMI
recipient of the Worrell-Fallon
award. Lalli was the Generals’
recipient.

Lalli ﬁnished the game with
14 saves.

The Generals were led by a
team effort as sophomore Ned
Rider and freshmen Tim Skeen
and Harry St. John each scored
two goals. Skeen also recorded
two assists in the Generals’ 9-8
victory.

“The environment was incred-
ible--a night game, rowdy fans
and packed stands... it was like
nothing I have ever played in be-
fore,” said St. John, and he said
he hoped the fans would follow
the team again to the semiﬁnal
match yesterday.

On Saturday the team traveled
to Randolph-Macon and left with
a 12-7 victory over the Yellow
Jackets.

Again, the win can be attrib-
uted to a strong second quarter as
the Generals shut out their oppo-
nent, going on a 5-0 rim.

“We knew we controlled our
own destiny heading into the
Randolph-Macon game, with a
win getting us in the ODAC tour-
nament, so we were happy with
the outcome, but we know that
we can play better lacrosse,” said
junior Grant Martin.

Martin ﬁnished the game with
one goal and an assist.

The Generals managed to grab
40 of the garne’s 59 ground balls
while goalies Chris Lalli and
freshman Alex Heaton combined
for nine saves.

The Generals also out-shot
their opponents 38 to 23.

St. John led the General’s with
three goals and two assists while
Randolph-Macon’s sophomore
Paul Johnsen led his team with
three goals.

Junior Jim Ryan and Skeen
each added two goals for the
Generals and Senior Clark F inney
added two assists.

The Generals concluded their
season yesterday at 4:00 p.m.
against Roanoke College in Roa-
noke. St. John pointed out that
anything could have happened.
“If we’ve learned anything this
season it’s that anyone can beat
anyone,” he said. The team was
hoping to avenge their loss from
earlier in the season, he said.

The men fell 16-9, ending their
season on a bitter note.

Roanoke will go on to play
Lynchburg, who defeated Hamp-
den-Sydney 10-9 on Tuesday.

Willams vs. Bush

Texans missed chance at ‘Michael Jordan ’of running backs

By NEIL “JEFF FRANCOEUR”
SHEAFFER
5 TA F F w R Ir E R

So Friday night (the night be-
fore the draft), I was lying in bed,
dead tired, when I hear a knock on
the door. It was my friend Jorts.
He walks in and broke the news
to me. The Texans had made an
agreement with Mario Williams
(6 years, $54 million) to make
him the ﬁrst pick in the 2006 NFL
Draﬁ. The ﬁrst thought to go
through my head, “With the sec-
ond pick in the 1984 NBA Draft
the Portland Trailblazers select
Sam Bowie from the University
of Kentucky.” It was really a
system overload for me. I was
not in the state of mind to try and
comprehend the ramiﬁcations of
the Texans’ actions. Reggie Bush
looks like he has the chance to
become the Michael Jordan of the
running back position. There’s a
good chance that Mario Williams
is more like Hakeem Olajuwan,
who was drafted ﬁrst by the Rock-
ets and had a great career, but he
was no Michael Jordan. I guess
we will have to wait and see what
happens. Until then, I will try and
put my convoluted thoughts down
on paper.

May I please recap Reggie
Bush’s most recent season for
you? Okay, he rushed 200 times
for 1740 yards, an average of 8.4
yards per carry (basically unheard
of), and 16 touchdowns, caught
37 passes for 478 yard and 2
touchdowns, and returned punts
and kicks, including one punt for
a touchdown. I have seen many
great college football players, in-
cluding Desmond Howard, Ricky
Williams, Donovan McNabb,
Kyle Luby (the rumors are true:
water covers 2/3 of the Earth,
while Luby covers the other 1/3),
and so many more. All of the guys
listed were great football players
(many still are), but I have never
seen a player with as much talent
as Reggie Bush. He is the most
versatile, most explosive and just
ﬂat out the best college football
player I have ever seen.

Mario Williams could be

the missing niece for the Tex-

ans, but, in my opinion, if they
were not going to draft Reggie
Bush, shouldn’t they have taken
D’Brickashaw Ferguson, the best
offensive lineman in the draft?
There is no way he can be ex-
pected to develop as he should if
he has no protection in front of
him. I had the chance to watch an
interview with Charley Casserly,
the Texans GM. He claimed that
the picking of Mario Williams
was purely a football decision. I
don’t believe this for a number of
reasons.

A) Reggie Bush is amazing. If
it were a football decision, Cas-
serly would have picked Reggie
Bush without glancing at Wil-
liams.

B) Bush can demand $5 — $10
million more than any other play-
er in the draft purely because he
is a uniquely exceptional football
player and so much better than
anyone else in the draft. The Heis-
man also ups the asking price.

C) There is a chance that the
whole ﬁasco about Reggie’s par-
ents’ home came into play here. I
doubt it.

Good, pass-rushing defen-
sive ends are hard to come by in
the NFL, and Mario Williams is
a physical specimen at 6’7” and
293 pounds. He runs a 4.73 40-
yard dash, which is exceptional
for a player of his size. He has
been compared to Julius Pep-
pers, who has been excellent in
the NFL. Reggie Bush, on the
other hand, has been compared
to Hall of Famer Gail Sayers. If
you could choose between having
Sayers and Peppers who would
you choose? Exactly.

You may be yelling at me right
about now, “Yol Dude! The Tex-
ans already have Domanick Davis,
a running back who has averaged
over 1,000 yards per season since
he arrived in the league, and he
can also catch the ball out of the
backﬁeld. The Texans don’t need
another running back no matter
how good he is!” Davis is no Reg-
gie Bush. Also, Davis was never
ﬁilly healthy last year and has not
been the most durable back, so it
makes sense to me for the Texans
to have some insurance. Or you

might be yelling at me, “Defense
wins championships!” It sure
does. I cannot agree more, but
if his college career mirrors his
NFL career at all, defenses cannot
stop Reggie Bush. Others may
be saying, “Bush never carried a
full load in college and isn’t ready
to be an every down back in the
NFL.” That is a load of malar-
key. He carried the ball 200 times
last season while LenDale White,
the “tougher” back, carried it 197
times and still got hurt. Reggie
has no history of injury, so do not
try and tell me that Reggie can’t
take the physical play in the NFL.
He will be ﬁne.

There is a good chance that
it goes down in history as one of
the most important drafts of the
next few decades, just as the 1984
NBA Draft will always be remem-
bered as one of the greatest drafts
ever. A player like Reggie Bush
(or Michael Jordan) comes along
only once a generation.
