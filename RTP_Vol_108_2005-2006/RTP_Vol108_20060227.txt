The hidden heroes

With little fanfare at home, university alumni serve in Iraq and Afghanistan

Bylessica Shaw
REPORTER

CNN blares monotonously in
the Commons as more updates
from Iraq and the ongoing quest
for Osarna ﬂash across the screen.
In this comfortable haven of Lex-
ington, it is easy to dismiss this
repetitive ‘drab’ from the anchor-
man as irrelevant. What many stu-
dents do not realize is courageous
Washington and Lee alums risk
their lives daily in this dangerous
War on Terror.

“Never in my wildest Law
School dreams could I have imag-
ined that one day I would be in
western Afghanistan wearing
twenty pounds of body armor, car-
rying an M4 carbine, a 9mm pis-
tol, a hand grenade, signal mirror
and various other accouterrnents
of war,” Bill Abernathy, ’8l, said.
“Yet here I am, about 70 miles
from the Iranian border, doing just
that.”

Abernathy is one among many
alumni who currently serve in the
United States Military or National
Guard. An Army Lieutenant Colo-
nel, he presently leads a team as
Army Chief of Embedded Train-
ers stationed in western Afghani-
stan. He said the mission of his
unit is to train the Afghanistan
National Army (ANA), to effec-
tively control violence and to se-
cure the safety of the nation.

“Any political scientist will tell
you that you cannot just brew up
democracy,” he said. “It has to
simmer and steep for decades.”

Recently, Abemathy’s unit suc-
cessfully maintained peace during
the parliamentary and presidential
elections. He said this was a big

step in the democratic direction. I

Despite significant improve-
ments, Abernathy said there re-
main many obstacles involving
living conditions.

“[Afghanistan has] hand-
pumped wells, open ditches that
carry water and waste and abject
poverty, where neither running
water not electricity is taken for
granted,” he said. “Afghanistan
truly is where the 21“ century
meets 100 B.C.”

Abernathy assumes many po-
sitions aside from military leader.
He said he often assists children
with their English skills.

“The English classes are seg-
regated by gender, and the teacher
poignantly said that, for girls,

Lt. Colonel Abernathy chats with local residents during a patrol near his base in Western Afghanistan

learning English is not just a class,
it’s a chance at liberation.”
Abernathy said protection is

always a concern, even though the

region is generally safe.

“I sleep with a loaded 9mm
automatic pistol at my headboard,
my loaded M4 carbine leaning
against a chair, a loaded AK-47
right next to it and even an old
.303 British Enﬁeld at my door.
Even inside our compound, I carry
the pistol with me everywhere ex-
cept the shower.”

Abernathy will serve in Af-
ghanistan for one year, at which
point his unit will be replaced by
others committed to the same task.

“I am both proud and humbled
to be here in service to my coun-

try and to this country. I am con-
vinced I and my team are making
a difference and will leave Afr-‘
ghanistan a better place for our
efforts.”

Across the continent, William
Fox, ’05, is stationed at Camp
Hovey in South Korea. Fox is a
platoon leader, in charge of train-
ing 27 American enlisted men and
stiﬂing North Korean aggression.
Fox said he is very conﬁdent in
his position, and he wishes to de-
ploy to Iraq in the near future.

“Ask me again when I’m step-
ping off the plane in the desert,
when the possibility of my own
death might start to seem real to
me,” he said. “I can’t think of any-
thing more important I will do in

my life [now] than lead young sol-
diers into combat and bring them

Fox said he sig"rie”d'”'u'p"'f6'r" ‘I

ROTC in 2001 because of the
challenge and the opportunity to
serve in the military before settling
down with a family.

“Due to the war on terror, I now
have a great opportunity to un-
dergo the greatest challenge I can

conceive of: leading men in com- ’

bat,” he said.

Back in the United States at
Fort Jackson, South Carolina,
Quincy Springs, ‘O3, is a com-
mander for a basic training unit,
transforming 188 civilians into
soldiers.

“My job there is to design the

training and plan the training that
is most identical to what they will
see in Iraq or Afghanistan,” he

"said. “We have a basic outline of

what each soldier needs to know
before they go to the next stage.”

Springs said he began ROTC
training as a sophomore after be-
ing inspired by a Thomas Nagle
book about life and death in a Phi-
losophy course taught by Profes-
sor Sessions. Springs ended his
college career in 2003 as a distin-
guished military graduate and a
Philosophy major.

“One of the major contributing
factors to my career in the mili-
tary was my degree in Philoso-
phy,” he said. “The liberal arts
education allows me to see things
from multiple sides in the mili-
tary.”

Prior to his assignment in
South Carolina, Springs was sta-
tioned in Korea where his unit

Bringing balance to the lectern

Prominent conservative thinker and policy maker comes to campus for Lee Chapel address

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

The Contact committee has in-
vited a man born in India to tell
the campus about America.

Dinesh D’Souza, who received
widespread national attention in
1991 when he published Illiberal
Education, is known for his at-
tacks against political correctness
on college campuses.

“Contact wants to promote a
balanced debate on campus,”
committee member Rachel
Seidenschnur said.

“A lot of the time there’s a per-
ception that the administration
only brings in liberal speakers,”
she said. “We thought D’Souza
was one of the best people to add
a different viewpoint.”

D’Souza plans to discuss top-
ics he addressed in his most recent
book, “What’s so Great About
America.”

Born and raised in India, his
background gives him a unique
perspective on American politics.
He came to the United States as

an exchange student at age 17 and
after high school graduation en-
rolled at Dartmouth College. He
feels that his life in India helped
him see issues differently than
most Americans.

“The immigrant brings to
America a comparative perspec-
tive. How does US compare to
other existing cultures? What hap-
pens in US is you hear lots of cri-
tiques but they’re utopian com-
parisons.”

D’Souza said that his ideologi-
cal beliefs really began to develop
while he was at school.

“I think I reﬂect the social con-
servatism that stretches from
China to India to the Middle East,
but I just wasn’t really aware of it
until my political views started
developing at Dartmouth.”

D’Souza said that critics of
America point to politics that are
“based on self—interest.” But he
added that people outside the US
do not attack this idea.

“An immigrant has maybe a
more realistic perspective, be-
cause they’ve gotten to see an-

other system first hand.”
D’Souza also speaks out
against affirmative action.

“I’m in favor of diversity,” he
said, “but the question to ask is
what kind of diversity we are look-
ing for.”

“I ’m in favor of di-
versity, but the ques-
tion to ask is what
kind of diversity we
are looking for. ”

DINESH D’SOUZA
 

He questioned whether the tra-
ditional views of diversity are in
line with a liberal education.

“Should we focus on gender di-
versity and racial diversity, or
things like diversity of thought and
belief?” he said.

Professor Mark Rush, Chair-
man of W&L’s politics depart-
ment, said that the school still con-
tinues to deal with diversity of
opinion.

Rush pointed to the rural loca-
tion of the university as a factor
in its struggle for diversity.

He added that over the past de-
cades the university has become
more geographically diverse.

At age 44, D’Souza is consid-
ered one of the most inﬂuential
policy makers in the US and is a
fellow at Stanford.

D’Souza plans to cover several
other topics in his speech, includ-
ing a discussion of the war in Iraq.

Though his articles regularly
appear in major publications like
The New York Times and the Wall
Street Journal, D’Souza has few
friendly things to say about the
mainstream media.

“As far as I can tell, all the ma-
jor city newspapers — Washington
Post, Boston Globe, New York
Times, Chicago Tribune, San
Francisco Examiner) tilt sharply
to the left. They manifestly do this
on editorial pages, which I don’t
mind, but they also do it on their
news pages.”

D’Souza argues that conserva-

tive media outlets have sprung
up in an attempt to ﬁnd a way
to get the conservative message
out over the public airwaves.

“Conservative bloggers, talk
radio, Fox News Channel, and
the Washington Times,”
‘D’Souza said, “represent a frus-
trated effort to get around main
stream media.”

D’Souza plans to discuss
several of the issues raised in his
books, including “The End of
Racism,” and “Letters to a
Young Conservative.”

Seidenshnur said D’Souza
may also touch on problems he
feels America faces in the world
today.

“America has simulta-
neously become the most loved
and most hated society in the
world. We need to vindicate
idea of liberty by showing that
America can be materially and
morally strong.”

D’Souza will speak in Lee
Chapel on Mar. 2.

BEIND
BARS

Here’s the latest update on who

  

ran afoul of the law during the
last few weeks. News editor
Jacob Geiger took a peek at
this weeks police reports to see

what you ’ve been up to.

 

Lawless law students
Though W&L’s undergradu-
ates took last week off, the
law students carried on the
party unabated. Bassel
Khalaf picked up a DIP on
Sat., Feb. 18. Khalaf was ar-
rested at 3:30 a.m., becom-
ing one of only a few law
students to run into serious
legal trouble this year. As
always, Behind Bars hopes
a few of his classmates
will help defend him in
court.

Wrong seat at the

defense table

Patricia Fenton, another
first-year law student, also
ran afoul of the police earlier
this month. She was cited
for being drunk in public
around 2:00 a.m. on Fri.,
Feb. 3. As if she didn’t have
problems enough already,
Fenton was then charged
with resisting arrest. Per-
haps in the future, when she
passes the bar exam, she will
advise her clients to go qui-
etly down to the station and
urge them not to cause a
fuss.

No break

for the police

With fewer people to watch
for during Feb. Break, the
police were able to track
down Cyrus Carawan. The
20-year-old was charged
with being drunk in public as
well as underage possession
of alcohol. In an effort to
cut down on arrest numbers,

maybe W&L can work out a
way to send the police on a
paid vacation of their own
(somewhere far from stu-
dents, of course). Then Lex-
ington could finally drink in
peace.

Should have left town
Will Moore, a W&L fresh-
man and Lexington resident,
was arrested on Fri., Feb. 17
and charged with underage
possession of alcohol and a
DIP. Moore was arrested
around 11:35 p.m., and he
was also charged with ob-
structing justice. Apparently
the snow and lack of light
has increased the combative-
ness of both students and po-
lice officers, as the last few
weeks have seen a dramatic
up tick in charges of resist-
ing arrest or obstructing jus-
tice.

With age comes
wisdom, right?

Though earlier editions of
Behind Bars were stocked
with plenty of freshman ar-
rests, it’s been a tough few
weeks for older students.
Samuel Nickles, a senior,
was arrested on Sun., Feb. 4
at 2:17 p.m. and hit with a
DIP. Five people — four of
them W&L students — have
received DIPs in the last
month. February may be
dark and depressing, but the
ever—vigilant officers of Lex-
ington are waiting for you to
meander on by in the wee
hours of a weekend morning.

Mind your manners
Clifton»Forge resident Jason
Staggs had a rough go of
things last Saturday, being
cited for a DUI as well as re-
fusal to comply with an
officer’s instructions. Staggs
was arrested at 3:05 a.m. on
Feb. 18. In all honesty, a
DUI stop is really not the
time to practice your favorite
methods of civil disobedi-
ence. Maybe it would have
just been better to climb into
the squad car.

You can drink at 21...
Christopher Woods, age 21,
of Buena Vista was arrested
on Fri., Feb. 3 around 10:30
p.m. Not only was he
charged with reckless driv-
ing, he faces a DUI charge.
To review: you were drink-
ing, you were driving, you
can’t do that.

But not drive at 21
Like Woods, another 21-
year-old faces a DUI charge
stemming from the first
weekend of February. Rob-
ert Stockwell was arrested
that Sunday morning, Feb. 5,
around 3:40 a.m. As count-
less students and locals
could have told Stockwell,
the police patrol all night.
You cannot just hope to
outlast them and then try to
drive. Though Police Chief
Bruce Beard reports that
DUI arrest rates are drop-
ping, it appears the latest

generation of legal drinkers
still hasn’t quite caught on
yet.

For form's sake

David Mann received a
ticket for driving the wrong
way on a one way street.
Like most other ‘wrong
wayers,’ Mann’s ticket came
late at night — 12:15 a.m. in

his case.Though the ticket it-

self is not very serious, Be-
hind Bars is continually sur-
prised at how many people

continue to have trouble with

the concept. There is good

news on the horizon, though;

since Mann’s ticket on Sun.
Feb. 5, not one person in
Lexington has received a
ticket for this offense.
Maybe there is hope for ev-
eryone after all.

All bark, all bite

Bruce Cooper was ticketed
on Feb. 21 for keeping a
dangerous dog. The charge
apparently stems from his
pet pit bull, since when the

ticket was issued at 9 a.m. he
was also charged with allow-

ing a pit bull to run at large.
Watch dogs are all well and
good, but usually they

should confine themselves to

a bit of growling and bark-
ing. Cooper’s dogs aren’t

accused of attacking anyone,

but Lexington Police de-
cided that maybe Cooper’s
friendly ole’ guard dog
should not be a breed that is
capable of mauling most
adults.

 Keeping Watch Variety of alumni

The Spectator political review returns to campus

By Sarah Kientz
R E P 0 RT E R

The conservative magazine
The Spectator reappears on cam-
pus this week.

According to the W&L Stu-
dent Affairs website, The Spec-
tator is “a non—partisan publica-
tion dedicated to promoting the
free exchange of ideas in an en-
vironment where meaningful de-
bate and ideological diversity
are often lacking.”

Senior co-editor-in-chief
Alex Weintz said the magazine
will focus on three central val-
ues: free speech, student au-
tonomy and honor.

“Free speech on college cam-
puses around the country has
been jeopardized by political
correctness,” Weintz said. “We
are not trying to offend anyone
but we’re not going to not say
something just because it
might.”

Weintz said the first issue will
include articles on the presiden-
tial search, pro-life movements
on campus and an appeal for ad-
ministration to take a more
“hands—off” approach to Con-
tact, as well as two articles on
national issues.

The issue will tentatively ap-
pear on newsstands Mar. 1, and
the staff hopes to publish two
more issues by the end of the
school year.

Editor-at—Large Rachael
Seidenschnur said the magazine
will “concentrate first and fore-
most on campus issues.”

“We want to address intellec-
tual issues occurring on campus
and provide serious arguments
for or against those topics,”
Seidenschnur said.

Seidenschnur has been work-

ing. with alumnus Kenneth
Cribb, Class of I970, to bring
The Spectator back to campus.
Seidenschnur said that although
some students may not agree
with what the magazine says,
there will be a place for it at
W&L.

“[Cribb] said he didn’t sup-
port everything the magazine
said [during his college years],
but he supported the student au-
tonomy and that there was a
publication of its kind,” she
said. .

Seidenschnur said this was
the reason she wanted to bring

“We are not trying to
offend anyone but
we’re not going to not
say something just be-

cause it might.”

A L E X W E I N T Z
Co—Editor of The Spectator
 

The Spectator back to campus.

Weintz said he feels The
Spectator needs to reappear at
W&L because there is a need for
a more “serious” publication.

“I have nothing against pub-
lications such as The Ring-tum
Phi, The Trident and inGeneral,
but a large portion of those pub-
lications focus on drinking and
parties and issues like that,”
Weintz said. “There’s a gaping
void for serious student publica-
tions that addresses local and
national issues.”

Weintz said the magazine will
address news issues while tak-
ing a “traditionalist” outlook. He
stressed that the magazine is not

affiliated with College Republi-
cans, but will have a conserva-
tive or libertarian spin.

The magazine’s mission state-
ment on the Student Affairs
website states, “We take it as our
mission to expose the inadequa-
cies of the non—traditionalist
ideas that do not understand and
fail to work with our student
body.”

Weintz also added that he
hopes students who do not share
conservative views will take in-
terest in The Spectator.

“I would think they’d be
happy,” Weintz said of liberal
students. “I enjoy reading things
from all sorts of people with dif-
ferent opinions and I’d hope
they’d appreciate it.”

David Mitchell, president of
Young Democrats, said he thinks
the magazine will “contribute the
conservative stereotype of W&L
students.” He does not think The
Spectator will have a large audi-
ence from the W&L liberal com-
munity.

“Democrats will probably pay
The Spectator as little attention
and respect as we currently give
to media such as FOX News,”
Mitchell said. “I will not person-
ally be an avid reader of the
magazine, but I respect the rights
of individuals with conservative
political views to exercise their
first amendment rights.”

Overall, Weintz said he hopes
students, no matter their politi-
cal affiliation, will read the
magazine.

“I hope people will read it,
take interest in it and talk about
it,” Weintz said. “It will be a posi-
tive impact for people to talk
about it even if they don’t agree
with it.”

took charge of keeping the
peace.

A few months after his de-
ployment, he was ordered to
transport 3,000 American sol»
diers and thousands of supplies
to Iraq in a brief amount of
time.

Springs has not been de-
ployed to Iraq, but he says he
will be happy to serve his coun-
try if the time comes.

“There’s nothing like
America,” he said. “It is, in my
opinion, thegreatest country
on the face of the planet. In the
military, you do your duty. If
I’m called up to do it, I will do
it. It just so happens that my
number hasn’t been called up.”

Davis White, ’03, currently
works for the Afghanistan Re-
construction Group, stationed
in Kabul as the Special Assis-
tant to the Ambassador. White
discovered the opportunity af-
ter his work on the Bush-
Cheney campaign and his ef-
forts serving on the presiden-
tial inaugural committee.

“W&L teaches you to be in-
dependent from my experi-
ence,” he said. “That’s what led
me to look for jobs out of the
box.”

Though much of Davis’
work involves an office, he
said there have been times of
danger.

“I was on a day-trip with the
US. ambassador, and there
was a suicide bombing about a
quarter mile from us which
killed 12 and injured 50-plus,”
he said.

Currently stationed in Iraq,

Brian Tinklepaugh, ’03, has
experienced constant action.
Last Spring, Tall Afar, a region
in Iraq, was overtaken by an
Iraqi branch of Al Qaeda. This
region was transformed into a
terrorist training ground for re-
ligious extremists and other
rebels. Tinklepaugh’s mission
was to halt its existence and
restore peace to the region.

“The city was totally out of
control, with insurgents domi-
nating the city physically and
psychologically,” he said.

Tinklepaugh’s unit was un-
der constant attack for a period
of time. He said every vehicle
in his platoon had sustained
damage from RPG fire or
other artillery. During a mu-
tine patrol, he and his unit
were fired upon by an insur-
gent vehicle.

“The explosion was like

nothing I had ever seen,” he ’

said. “It shook my 34-ton ve-
hicle and threw us around in-
side the turret. When I looked
back, all I saw was a fireball
and billowing black smoke.’’ a

Tinklepaugh said his expe-
rience at W&L and training at
Virginia. Military Instutute
helped him achieve many of
his missions. .

According to Scholarship
and Enrollment Officer at
VMI Major John Wranek, un-
til the early 1990s, W&L of-
fered its own ROTC program
to students. In, 1996, W&L and
VMI established a partnership
that now allows students to
enroll in ROTC classes on the
VMI campus.

“Right now, out of those
that commission, we see two

or three per year,” he said;

“We like to see three per year,

and I think we can get there.”
Presently, there are five

"freshmen, two sophomores,

two juniors and one senior
involved in the joint pro-
gram. V

Sophomore Rob Modlin
is in his second year with the
program. Though one is not
committed to military service
when enrolled in this pro-
gram, Modlin plans to serve
for a number of years.
Modlin said that W&L is pre-
paring him in critical ways
for his time in the military.

“Washington and Lee be-
lieves that students should be
the leaders in their commu-
nity,” he said. “The military
is completely centered on the
idea of leadership and vi»,
sion.” ’ I

Freshman Sean McKinley‘ ‘
is also enrolled in the ROTC
program. McKinley said his «
decision is based on moral?
reasons.

“I believe in what we’re.
doing over there,” he said. “I
feel it’s my duty to serve my
country in its time of need.” .

Language of home

Making the move from Ghana to Virginia brought numerous lifestyle changes and cultural adjustments

After traveling from Africa, Ghanaian

students at Washington and Lee had to

master another language and adjust to new

customs and social traditions.

By Steph Wiechmann
5 TA F F W R IT E R

Eﬁa. For sophomore Marian
Botchway and freshman Grace
Andrews, that translates “home.”
And home is an ocean away.

Both Botchway and Andrews
were born in Ghana, West Africa,
a small country about the size of
Oregon.

Botchway still makes her
home there, in a city called Tema,
about 30 minutes away from the
capital city of Accra.

Andrews and her family
moved to the U.S. 13 years ago,
but she carries dual citizenship
and considers Ghana just as
much her home as her residence
in Tennessee.

“At home [in Tennessee],”
she said, “we ate the food, spoke
the language and wore the

clothes. It’s so much a part of
who I am.”

Botchway and Andrews speak
Twi, which is pronounced like
“tree,” one of the major native
languages of
Ghana.

There are
many different
dialects of the
language.

B otc hw ay
speaks the
dialect of her
father’s tribe,
A k u a p i m .
A n d r e w s ’
dialect comes
from her mother’s tribe, Achim.
Both girls are able to understand
each other.

But, since they are the only
two current Ghanaian students at
Washington and Lee, they don’t
get to speak Twi very much.

“I miss speaking Ga and Twi
with my friends,” said Botchway,
who also speaks another major
native language of Ghana. “I talk
to Grace sometimes,” she added,
but since both are usually in
company of others, they usually
speak English.

Twi is different from romance
languages, like Spanish and
French, because it does not
differentiate between feminine
and masculine words.

“It’s not he or she, it’s they,”
said Andrews.

The language was originally
written in symbols. Over time,
it was “Romanized” and written
with letters, though sometimes
letters different from the Roman
alphabet.

The Twi alphabet includes
letters that look like a backwards

“a,” “c” and “h.”

The Ghanaian culture,
however, is not just about the
language.

“I miss the closeness,” said
Botchway, who has not been
back to Ghana since she left the
country to begin college in 2004.

“Lots of people who are close
to you in Ghana live within an
hour of each other.”

Botchway recently went to
visit a Ghanaian friend who goes
to college in Boston and found
the ten-hour drive unsettling.

Both women, like many other
international students, went
through their share of culture
shock when they entered the
United States.

Botchway, who had attended
an international boarding school
at home, was prepared for what
awaited her and was old enough
to successfully deal with the
differences.

“The food wasn’t spicy
enough,” Botchway said. Then,
she had to get used to the way
people behave in America.

“In Ghana, you don’t give
something to someone with your

left hand. It’s disrespectful.”

In America, she had to learn
that that gesture did not mean
anything bad.

Andrews moved to the U.S.
when she was four years—old and
immediately attended an
international school.

She had begun school in
Ghana at two-years, so she had
a basic understanding of English.
But, she refused to speak it — she
spoke Twi.

“My brother attended school
across the street,” she said. “My
teacher had to call his school and
have him come over at snack
time so he could translate what I
wanted to eat.”

Being in an international
school was beneﬁcial, she said,

“Ghana is where
my family is,
and that’s my home.”

because other students had the
same problems. “We were all
going through culture shock
together.”

There were things that the
Andrews family and Botchway
had to learn through time.

In Ghana, almost everything
is eaten with your hands, and
Ghanians have to learn what
foods are typically eaten with
utensils in the U.S.

But, as Andrews said, not
everything can be learned.

“Sarcasm is lost on my
mother,” she said. “Sarcasm is
a very American thing.”

Botchway and Andrews both
hope to someday return to
Ghana.

“There’s a resurgence of my
generation,” said Andrews.
“Many have a desire to go back.”

Andrews, a politics and
Spanish major with a
concentration in Women’s
Studies, wants to work for
women and children’s rights.

Botchway, a biology major,
wants to stay in the U.S. for
graduate studies, but does intend
to go back to Ghana.

She said, “Ghana is where my
family is and that’s my home.”

W&L considers partnering with the Posse Foundation in order to acquire much—needed diversity

By EJ. Boyer
STAFF WRITER

On a campus known for its
lack of diversity, there may be a
new Posse next year to teach us
a thing or two.

The Posse Foundation, which
develops, trains, and enables
underprivileged youth leaders to
attend top colleges and univer-
sities, is in talks with Washing-
ton and Lee to bring its program
to the school. '

If adopted, a “multicultural
Posse” of ten students whom the
traditional admissions procedure
may have missed, would attend
W&L on full scholarships. Be-
sides obtaining a top—rate educa-
tion, the Posse would “help pro-
mote cross-cultural communica-
tion on campus.”

The Posse program recruits
6,000 students graduating from
public high schools in New York
City, Washington D.C., Boston,
Chicago and Los Angeles, and
after a three—step admissions pro-
cess, chooses around 300 Posse
Scholars each year.

To be chosen as a Posse
Scholar, students must perform
well on the Posse-innovated Dy-
namic Assessment Process
(DAP), an alternative way to
judge a student’s capabilities and
potential beyond the traditional
SAT and GPA approach. Posse
identiﬁes its three main criteria
in selection as a student’s “lead-
ership talent, ability to work in a
team with people from diverse
backgrounds and desire to suc-
ceed.”

Once chosen, Posse scholars
select their top three universities
and colleges of the 24 currently
participating, which include
Middlebury, Vanderbilt and
Pomona. Then, the admissions

 

office at the universities and the
Posse staff pick the ten kids best
fit for each school. These ten
kids are now a “posse,” and go
through a training program to-
gether that requires them to meet
weekly for two hours over an
eight-month period. The training
targets team building and group
support, cross-cultural commu-
nication, leadership, and aca-
demic excellence.

The leadership ability found
in their students is one of Posse’s
prized accomplishments. About
70 percent of Posse students be-
come leaders or founders of cam-
pus groups. “They don’t star as
students,” President Harlan
Beckley said, “they star as lead-
ers and do well as students.”

One concern skeptics have is
the academic record of the Posse
students. They would bring
down the average SAT score of
any university they attend.

Beckley estimates that the
SAT_scores of an entering class
including Posse students would
drop the average from 1380 to
1372. The grades of Posse stu-
dents in their freshman year are
typically lower than the grades
of their school’s average student.

However, by graduation,
Posse grades are usually equal or
even a little better than those of
the average student. Beckley said
he would like to see clear-cut
data on Posse students’ GPAs

before any decision is made, but
said there is every reason to be-
lieve they do just as well as the
average student by the time they
graduate. /

‘ Professor Gwyn Campbell of
the Language Department dis-
missed the objection about the
lowered GPA, saying, “We don’t
need to see GPAs. I trust Beckley,
and he trusts Posse.”

Another concern about the
Posse program is how the stu-
dents factor into the campus
population and how the program
would be funded. Posse students
can either be “add-ons” to the
university enrollment, meaning
the student body size would ex-
pand; or, Posse students can re-
place members of the student
body, and the size would not
change. In terms of financing the
Posse students, President
Beckley said the university
would need a “huge infusion” of
need—based money or to convert
some of the existing merit—based
money, or both.

Another student raised the
concern that the Posse students
might find it difficult to acclimate
to W&L. President Beckley
stressed that even though 90 per-
cent of Posse students are people
of color, “they themselves are di-
verse.” They are so different
from one another, Beckley said,
that he foresees no problem with
them branching out from one an-

“I was really excited because I think

anything that brings diversity to W&L is

important and will help us.”

other and mixing well with the
student body.

Beckley heard about Posse at
an academic conference he at-
tended in New York City, at
which Posse’s founder, Deborah
Bial, spoke about the program.
The Posse Foundation then ap-
proached W&L about a possible
partnership.He said that Posse
students who would attend W&L
are students who would flourish
here, but don’t have opportuni-
ties or are overlooked in the ad-
missions process. He also said
that diversiﬁcation would actu-
ally help the university’s
rankings.

The possibility of a Posse at
W&L is nonetheless controver-
sial. Sophomore Jenny N iemann
heard about the-Posse program
when Bial came to campus to
speak. “I was really excited be-
cause I think anything that brings
diversity to W&L is important
and will help us,” she said.

However, a sophomore man
who wishes to remain anony-
mous said he hopes that W&L
does not partner with the Posse
Foundation. He said he does not
think that a forced diversiﬁcation
process is the answer, much less
one that allows some students to
be accepted regardless of SAT
scores, grades and other tradi-
tional academic qualifiers that
the rest of the student body needs
for admission regardless of need
or race.

One professor at the informa-
tion session pointed out that next
year is the fortieth anniversary of
integration at W&L. Introducing
the Posse program seems like the
ultimate way to commemorate
that anniversary, but Beckley
said he does not know when a de-
cision will be made.

Long year over in first round

g Ups and downs of girls basketball season end with tough loss in ODAC tournament

By Andy McEnroe
G U EST WRITER

“It was a long bus ride back,”
described Sophomore point
guard Emily Wolff, after their
disappointing 71-46 loss to
Bridgewater College on Jan. 18.

At the time, Washington and
Lee stood with a record of 4-11
overall and a conference record
of 3-9. The Generals had lost
ﬁve in a row, all to ODAC foes.

The team now also had to
face the facts that Sophomore
Forward Hayley James was lost
for the season with a knee injury.

It appeared that the Generals
were looking at the possibility
of not being in the 2006 ODAC
tournament.

But if there was one word to
describe the 2005-2006 Wash-
ington and Lee Generals
women’s basketball team it
would be “resilient.”

After the Bridgewater loss,
the Generals went on to win six
of their ﬁnal nine regular sea-
son games with key conference
wins over Emory and Henry,
Roanoke and Lynchburg, play-
ing their way into the ODAC
tournament as the 8"‘ seed.

During this stretch W&L was

paced by Senior guard Louisa
Feve. Feve, who was only aver-
aging 9.1 points per game before
this ﬁnal stretch of the regular
season, carried the Generals on
her back, scoring 16 points with
six assists and 10 rebounds in the
Generals win over E&H, on Jan.
24, and 20 points and six assists
in a huge road victory over
Roanoke on Jan. 28.

“We saw a side of Feve’s
game that we had not seen this
year starting with the Emory and
Henry victory. Feve had distrib-
uted the ball well throughout the
season but now she was begin-
ning to take it to the basket her-
self and score,” said WLUR
women’s basketball Analyst Will
Waller on Feve’s outstanding
play. Feve finished the regular
season in the top 20 for scoring
in the ODAC and in the top five
for assists.

Feve’s passing ability has
helped Sophomore Kristen
Krouchick and Junior Jessica
Hunsinger provide a formidable
dynarnic—duo offensive threat for
the Generals.

Krouchick averaged 14.5
points per game, shooting an
outstanding 49.1 percent from
the field and 36.1 percent from

beyond the three point are.
Krouchick also contributed on
the boards as she pulled down an
average of 5.3 rebounds per
game.

“When Kristin is on, she is
one of, if not the best, shooters
in the conference. There were
many times when our offense
was stalled and we relied on
Kristen to get us a big basket,”
said Wolff. Krouchick ﬁnished in
the top ten in ODAC in scoring
and shooting percentage.

Where Krouchick is the threat
from the outside, Hunsinger pro-
vides a strong post presence for
the Generals.

Hunsinger led the Generals in
scoring, averaging 15.1 points
per game. She was also ﬁnished
ﬁrst in the conference in blocks
and second in rebounding, aver-
aging 2.8 blocks per game and

10.1 rebounds per game.

Said Waller, “The Generals
were a different team when Jes-
sica was not on the ﬂoor. With-
out Jessica, the Generals were
undersized, but with Jessica on
the ﬂoor it gave the team an ad-
vantage on both the offensive
and defensive ends.

Waller called Hunsinger
“someone who could score down
low as well as create second
chance opportunities with her
offensive rebounding prowess.
On the defensive end, her shot-
blocking ability caused many
opposing players to alter their
shot when driving into the paint.”

The Generals also received
solid contributions throughout
the year from two ﬁrst year start-
ers, Wolff and Freshmen For-
ward Kara Nadeau.

“Emily has done a great job

“The Generals played inspired

basketball, giving the number one
seed...their biggest scare by far in

the tournament. ”

End of the fight

Wrestling team ﬁnishes 8th at Centennial Tourney despite strong season

By Mike Fahey
STAFF WRITER

Conference championships are
supposed to be when a team peaks
and has its best performance.

In the case of the Washington
and Lee Wrestling team, the Cen-
tennial Conference Champion-
ships were marred by the injury of
one of the team’s stars and the dis-
qualification of another key per-
former because he did not make
weight.

Earlier in the season, Jesse
Sataloff, one of team strongest
wrestlers, sustained a minor con-
cussion while wrestling an oppo-
nent. At the tri-match between
W&L, Ursinus and Muhlenberg,
Sataloff suffered a second concus-
sion within two weeks of his first
concussion. The injury not only
sent him home, but it also side-
lined him for the rest of the sea-
son.

Peter Lawrence did not make

weight in the 149 pound weight
class, leaving the Generals with-
out an entry in the weight division.

Down two of their best wres-
tlers, the Generals were faced with
an uphill battle as they began their
quest.

As freshman John Christopher
explained, “I think we may have
peaked at the wrong time.”

While the team did not place
as high as they would have had
they been wrestling at full
strength, two young stars were still
able to make their mark at the con-
ference championships.

Christopher placed third over-
all in the heavyweight division,
one of only two Generals to place
in the conference championships.
Christopher was humble about his
results in the championships, say-
ing, “This year was a learning year
for me along with several others
and hopefully we can put every-
thing together come next season.”

The only other General to place

at the conference championships
was Tom Hosford, who placed
fourth in the 125 weight class.

Sophomore Anthony Boniello,
who wrestled in the 165 weight
class said, “I feel like the wres-
tling team had a lot more poten-
tial than how we wrestled at the
Centennial Conference. We had
Jesse out due to an injury and Pe-
ter didn’t make weight. These two
kids could have easily put on a lot
more points for the team standing,
elevating our team standing.”

While this season may have
had a disappointing ending, the
young team is excited about sea-
sons to come, as it only has one
junior, Max Courtney.

Boniello explained, “We had
an excellent season, surpassing
many people’s
expectations...We’re all looking
forward to next year’s season with
high expectations due to our ex-
perience gained from this season.”

of stepping up into the role of
starting point guard. One of the
things that impresses me most
about her is how she always goes
hard.

“Kara has really made a great
transition into college basketball
and gives us a true post. She
knows how to use her body well
offensively and defensively, but
she can also step out and knock
down a three.” said sophomore
forward Hayley James.

Wolff averaged 7.1 points per
game, 4.9 rebounds per game
and 2.6 assists per game on the
year, while Nadeau averaged a
solid 6.6 points per game and 5.4
rebounds.

A big part of W&L’s success-
ful turnaround can be credited to
the bench play of sophomore
Amanda Kane, freshman
Bethany Ridenhour and senior
Taylor Gibson.

“Our bench was a key part of
our success the second half of the
season both in the game and in
practice.” said Wolff, “without
them I don’t think we would have
been able to pull off the kind of
streak we did to make the tour-
nament.”

W&L finished the regular
season with a record of 11-14
overall, and an ODAC record of
8-12.

Their conference record was
good enough for the Generals to
garner the eighth seed in the tour-

nament where they faced the‘

number one seed Randolph Ma-
con Yellow Jackets (2l—2 over-
all, 18—1 in the ODAC). The Yel-
low Jackets came into the tour-
nament ranked ninth in the USA
Today/ESPN/WBCA national
poll.

The Generals played inspired
basketball, giving the number
one seed Yellow Jackets their
toughest game and biggest scare
by far in the tournament.

The Generals were led by
sophomore forward Kristen
Krouchick , who scored a team-
high 21 points, dished out a ca-
reer—high seven assists and
grabbed ﬁve rebounds.

Hunsinger finished with 19
points, nine rebounds and three
blocks.

Feve notched 16 points, nine
rebounds, a game-high eight as-
sists and a game-best ﬁve steals.

Despite the outcome, the
Generals Women’s Basketball
program is strong, graduating
only three seniors.

Look for the Generals to build
on their late season success and
continue to develop into a for-
midable ODAC contender for
years to come.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Decades of winning

Women ’s swimming wins thirteenth straight ODACS

By Elliott Walker
STAFF WRITER

Thirteen may be an unlucky
number for some, but for the
women’s swim team, it meant just
the opposite. The team claimed
their thirteenth consecutive
ODAC championship last week-
end, beating 11 other teams in
their quest to be number one.

Like the men’s team, the
women had an overwhelming vic-
tory, beating their opponents by
260.5 points. To keep the team
motivated to swim their best, head
coach Kiki Jacobs said she gave
them point goals for each meet.

Although the team had some
struggles, said Jacobs, the team
was able to come together in the
end to win the meet. Some of their
top swimmers were present at the
meet, but were unable to score
points for the team. These girls
were swimming exhibition, mean-
ing that they can still swim for
time, but do not count in the team
score. Even though these girls
were not scoring, the team still
managed to emerge victorious.

“It was a fun championship”
said head coach Kiki Jacobs, who
was named ODAC coach of the
year for the tenth time at the meet.
Freshman Jule Miata said Jacobs

“brings such a positive atmo-
sphere to the team” and has been
one of the most amazing coaches
she’s ever had.

Jacobs also credits the strong
parental support that the girls re-
ceive throughout the season.
Nineteen sets of parents came to
supportthe 21 girls swimming at
the ODAC championships this
year. The parents bring presents
for all of the girls, as well as
Gatorade and other things to keep
everyone going, said Danielle
Cardone, a sophomore on the
team.

“It’s our own little cheering
section,” she said. “It’s great to
have them.”

The team finished their season
with a perfect 6-0 ODAC record
and 10-5 overall. Miata says their
success this season was partly due
to the encouraging attitudes
among teammates.

Next year, Jacobs said she’d
like the team to have more than
10 dual meet wins, set new school
recordsyand of course, win that
fourteenth ODAC championship.
Recruiting efforts promise to bring
in talented new swimmers for next
year, said Miata.

“I only see the team getting
better,” she said.

The men’s swimming
team was only predicted to
win the Bluegrass Mountain
Conference Championship
by 30-40 points, but the
closest team lagged behind
by a whopping 315 points
last weekend. The Gener-
als’ impressive win was their
third straight championship

“We knew that there
would be good competition

the team. ~

tioned that Burr Datz has worked

Shinofield went on to say that
this has been his favorite season
in the past ten years. “Every mem-
ber of the team has contributed to
our success this year, and I

fort they gave,” he said.

The Washington and Lee base-

junior designated hitter Richard

Brownlow took the hill for the
Generals in the opener and pitched
well, giving up only two unearned
runs on four hits in four innings
to capture the victory. Sophomore
Steve Marcott then came in and
pitched four scoreless innings,
striking out five batters.

After a tough loss to Emory, the
Generals were back in the swing
of things as they dominated
Oglethorpe. Senior second
baseman Scott Gosselink was 4-6
with a homerun, two doubles and
five RBIs to pace the Generals,
and junior Jordan Wesley also
homered. Junior righthander
Clayton Edwards got the win af-
ter giving up three runs in six in-
nings of work. Freshman
righthander Andrew Henderson
came in to pitch three scoreless
inning to pick up the save.

In a 15-4 victory over Virginia

Intermont, James Madden again
led the way for the Generals, go-
ing 3-4 with a triple, a homerun,
three runs and four RBIs. The
Generals jumped out to a 2-0 lead

after the first inning on a pair of
RBI singles by Wesley and Mad-

den. Once they had the lead, they
never gave it up. Senior first
baseman Taylor McConnell went
3-5 with two doubles and two
runs, while junior leftfielder
David Miller was 2-4 with two
stolen bases, two runs and three
RBIs.

Sophomore lefthander John
Parker pitched four and one-thirds
innings, allowing two runs on five
hits with three strikeouts. Sopho-
more righthander Tim Livingston
picked up the win, throwing one
and one-thirds innings of scoreless
ball.

Madden has had an incredible
start to the season, with three
home runs in the team’s first six

games. Parker said, “At the begin-
ning of the season the third out-
field spot was up for grabs, and I
think James has secured it with his
excellent all- around perfor-
mance.”

Parker also was very compli-
mentary to the man behind the
plate, Wesley. Parker said, “Jor-
dan is the defensive rock of this
team, and has been doing a fan-
tastic job at game calling and han-
dling the pitching staff, which to
this point has underachieved in
terms of preseason expectations.”

Wesley said, “Overall, we have
played well enough to get off to a
good start, though I don’t think
anyone on the team will deny that
we are playing to less than our po-
tential.”

The season has only just begun
as the Generals have yet to begin
conference play. As Wesley said,
“the most important part of the
year [is] conference play.”

and placed eighteenth overall.
The year before, they were twenty-
first.

As of now, they have one ath-
lete qualified to swim. Michael
Ginder, a junior standout, quali-
ﬁed with his time in the 200 back-
stroke event. Five other athletes,
said Shinofield, received NCAA
“B” cut times at the meet. The top
20 athletes across the country with

“B” cut times will make it to

Nationals, so the team will

travel to Maryland this week-
end to try to improve to “A”
cut times. An “A” cut time
automatically sends a swim-
mer to Nationals. Addition-
ally, two of the Generals’ re-
lay teams hope to make it to
the meet as well.

“If everything goes well at
Maryland, which it will, then

we will have an army of,

swimmers at Nationals who
will be prepared both physi~
cally and mentally to turn
heads and upset the big boys
at Nationals,” said sophomore
Alex Sweet. Ginder added,

editorial

Posse for
everyone

With the very. best of
intentions, administration at this
school is trying to attract diversity
with the Posse Foundation.

The idea behind Posse is solid:

' students are chosen based on

some other set of criteria, in order
to seek out talent which would
have otherwise gone unnoticed.

Seems ﬂawless, right?

Well, maybe.

The Posse program seems like
a great idea in the sense that these
students, who would not
otherwise have been glanced at,
get the chance to move out of that
station.

Without the program, our
school is a poorly-tossed salad
bowl of WASPS with pretty
uniform upper middle class
breeding.

Consistently, W&L turns out
successful kids--people who go on
to do something big with their
lives.

Do students outside of this
network deserve the same
opportunity?

Certainly.

If they weren’t offered the
opportunity by W&L, would they
be forever denied success?

Unlikely.

But if they attend W&L as a
part of this generous program--a
veritable form of bussing on a
much larger scale--then the
program and the school can take
credit for saving a life.

If you think about it, one of the
most commonly—asked questions
in any given class is always, “Is
this going to be on the test?”

The people chosen under
“normal” criteria at Washington
and Lee do not start class
discussions. Rare is the class
where stimulating intellectual
discussion can be held.

And yet many students manage
to get above a 3.0.

That is because W&L students
know how to get the A. We know
how to take a test, and how to
study, and how to wheedle extra
credit from our professors.

But we cannot, for some
reason, advance beyond success
on paper.

The Posse Scholars would
come from the type of families
and schools that don’t understand
or care about grades in the same
way that many W&L students do.

In the world of a non-W&L
student, getting a C is okay if you
learn something and do your best.

In the world of the Posse
Scholar, getting somewhere in life
means going the extra mile, not
running the fastest around the
track.

Further, how comfortable
would a Posse scholar be in the
country club that is our school?
No amount of financial aid can
compensate for a life spent in the
much-larger bracket of American
society--the lower-middle class.

Without some kind of parental‘

funding, it would be difficult to
participate in the ever-prevalent
Greek system which rules all.
Road trips and vacations are out
of the question. Nice new clothes
for every event would be a burden.

Would the misery of societal
rejection encourage a healthy
learning environment?

The fact is that this school was

not designed for a low-income
student.

Should the Posse scholars be
thankful? Should the program
expect absolute servitude in
thanks for the opportunity?

That would be truly unfair.

But let’s say, for example, that
this program were implemented,
that we conned ten kids into going
here so that we can learn from
them and they can make us look
better.

The Posse students, who
would be, effectively, stuck
together in a “posse,” would likely
not mingle into the crowds on the
hill or at the frat parties.

They would stick together for
the simple reason that they are
alike in their common bond--a
somewhat unique one at W&L.

Worse yet-—if the Posse
scholars have these special
characteristics that are so valuable
to the institution, why aren’t they
the admissions criteria for
everyone?

The program is designed to
bring diversity to the school and
opportunity for the scholar.

But it raises questions about
the caliber of student W&L
admits.

Apparently, the school admits
any schmuck with a good GPA
and high SAT score.

The administration should
hold every incoming student to
the same standards as the Posse
scholar. We need leaders rather
than another kid who gets good
grades.

We need students to care about
their subject matter, and not their
resume and honor roll status.

But let’s start with baby steps.

The Posse Foundation, with its
program, has a goal that is
laudable and important--as long
as it avoids setting quotas on race
or financial background.

The Posse student, who has
talents outside of classroom work
is more useful at this institution
filled with students who do their
best not to stand out. It is both
unrealistic and unfair to expect an
18-year-old to set an example, but
the leadership tendencies of the
Posse scholars may prove useful.

Concerns that the Posse
scholars, with their not-so-
impressive GPAs, would hurt the
school’s average and make us
look bad are not unfounded,
either.

Most Posse students are not
necessarily “good” at school.
They didn’t get A’s in high school-
-and they won’t get A’s here.

But those concerns are purely
about appearance rather than
content--not unlike the behavior
of most W&L students in class.

In truth, we need Posse
scholars at this university.

We need students who
remember how to learn they way
we did when we were small
children.

We need students who
question the professor over his
material, and not his tests. We
need people who are not afraid to
speak in class.

We need to become Posse
scl1olars—-all of us.

The above represents the
majority opinion of the editorial
staff of the Ring-tum Phi.

 

“If they attend W&L as a part of this

generous program--a veritable form of

bussing on a much-larger scale--then the

program can take credit for saving a life. ”

As New Orleans rebuilds, one citizen reflects on her experiences

Her life torn apart by a natural disaster,

Bonnie Fay visited home only to ﬁnd a

cesspool of ruin. She talks about the

wreckage and waits for healing.

By Bonnie Fay
GUEST COLUMNIST

I am from New Orleans. I
guess I should say, I was from
New Orleans. I was from a city
famous for its lively spirit, great
food, superb music and laid back
way of life. I was from a big city
with a small town mentality and a
personality not found anywhere
else in this country.

That city is gone.

Now I say that I am from the
new New Orleans. That’s what
they’re calling it down there now,
the new New Orleans. I am from
a city whose heart has been
broken. You can see it in the face
of every person you meet. We
have all had our hearts broken and,
as Chris Rose of the Times
Picayune so plainly put it, “when
you look into our eyes, you will
see the saddest story ever told.”
Fortunately, the city that we all
were from hasn’t been forgotten.
Being from the old New Orleans
meant possessing not only a first
class sense of humor, but an
inordinate amount of patience and
an ever-hopeful smile; a sort of
grin-and-nod, go with the flow
attitude that made life a little less
stressful. And if you look very
hard, past the sad story that our
eyes will tell you, you will find
that easy optimism lurking
beneath the surface, silently
assuring us that, surely, things will
get better.

For right now though, things

 

are not getting better. Driving into
the city from the east over Winter
Break, past some of the hardest hit
areas, it looks the same as it did
when I drove in for Christmas and
much the same as it must have
looked in the weeks immediately
following the storm.

Trash, fallen trees and other
debris and demolished homes and
businesses surround the
interstate. Car dealerships and
grocery stores are flattened;
Lowe’s, Wal-mart and other big
chain stores are boarded up and
abandoned.

Coming back home makes my
heart break all over again.

If you can make it past the
wasteland scene and into the city,
you find what my mother, only

partly in jest, calls “Soviet.

:9

Russia. Here is the twenty
‘percent of the city that ‘didn’t find
itself under ten or more feet of
water and where most of those
brave enough to return have
settled.

Everywhere you go, from the
gas stations to the grocery stores
to the restaurants, there are lines
that stretch out the door and
sometimes down the block. There

are piles of trash and lumber on
the street comers and their pickup
is, at best, sporadic.

Ominous warnings of “Looters
shot on site” are still painted on
the brick walls of homes and
businesses, a glowing reminder of
the days of anarchy immediately
following the storm. Few of the
trafﬁc lights are functional; those
that work at all ﬂicker and blink
uncertainly. Not that it matters,
since traffic laws seem to have
been washed away with the
ﬂoodwaters. Where the traffic
signals are out, stop signs have
been hastily erected, propped up
on sandbags or partially hidden
behind tree limbs or piles of trash.
Driving in new New Orleans is
strictly at your own risk.

If you travel downtown, you
will find the area which suffered
the least damage from the storm,
but which is suffering ten—fold in
its aftermath. Pre—Katrina, New
Orleans’ primary industry was
tourism.

While home for break, I went
with a friend down to the French
Quarter one night, but the streets
were eerily empty. Café du
Monde is open again and serving
beignets 24 hours a day, but they
have no one to whom they can sell
their sweets.

Those few souls adventurous
enough to come to the city on
holiday are no longer interested in
all the things in which we took
pride: the French Quarter, historic
architecture, great food and
fantastic music.

Now those who come to visit
want to see the carnage. They

“For the low price of $4] .95 per person, all the

carnage you can stomach will be shown to you

from the climate-controlled safety of a coach bus.”

Reports  
insensitive

To the Editor:

I would like to comment on
your recent editorial concerning
Behind Bars, the new feature to
the Phi. While I fully support the
First Amendment and enjoy the
right to free speech, as well as
my right to examine matters of
public record, I don’t support
nor understand the vindictive
nature and defense of this
feature.

The Phi writes of their
support of the “acquisition and
publication of knowledge which
is pertinent to this campus.”
How is a reproduction of police
records containing the names
and actions of fellow students

pertinent? This isn’t actual .

reporting nor is it news. It isn’t
even original. By publishing the
column, you only succeed at
making a small campus even
smaller by pointing a ﬁnger at
every student that makes a
mistake. It should never be the
responsibility of the Phi to
punish students for their actions.

They are already being punished
by the police, the university and
quite probably, their families.
Why mock them by making the
entire campus aware of what
they’ve done? This seems
entirely contrary to the founding
ideals of integrity and honor that
our founders intended to this
campus. '

Furthermore, many columns
such as Behind Bars simply use
nouns and ages to describe
arrests. Why doesn’t the Phi
utilize this format rather than
calling out specific students? I
believe it’s disrespectful to your
fellow students. Just because you
can publish it doesn’t make it
right.

A column just to “stir people
up” seems like a weak excuse to
rehabilitate an ailing paper and
certainly didn’t get me to read
any further than page 2.

want to see what happens when
the indifference of nature and the

miscalculations of human
engineering meet. And that is
exactly what they see.

Opportunists, encouraged by city
officials, have set up tour buses
to show people around the areas
hardest hit by the storm. For the
low price of $41.95 per person, all
the carnage you can stomach will
be shown to you from the climate-
controlled safety of a coach bus.

Since over three quarters of the
city still lies untouched by

, rebuilding efforts and in complete

ruin, there is no shortage of
“sights” for seeing: people’s
ruined livelihoods laid to waste
for your viewing pleasure.

I can’t decide if this is a good
effort by some to make the best of
a bad situation or if it’s just sick.

No one has stepped up to the
plate to work past the self—interest
and the bullshit politics that were
responsible for the chaos in the
days immediately following the
storm. Not one of the powers that
be is willing to step up and take
responsibility, to bear the burden
of blame and then move past it to
try and fix our broken hearts. The
potential for the “rebirth” that is
so often spoken of is there, the
people are willing. But rebirth
will not happen without leadership
and intelligence, both of which are
in short supply right now.

While the new New Orleans
searches for its new leader, it
slowly picks up the pieces of its
broken heart. Little by little,
businesses reopen. Schools are
starting to come back. We are
even having Mardi Gras this year.
Very slowly, we are picking up the
pieces and building the new New
Orleans up to its potential. Maybe
soon the tourists will start coming
down for the food and fun again.
But until then, we take it one day
at a time and tell ourselves that,
surely, things will get better.

Fancy frenzy

The hunt for a date to Fancy Dress can be a perilous adventure

HE SAID

Fancy Dress is right around
the corner, and unfortunately
y’all know what that means: it is
time to start searching for a date.
Well, before you decide that you
want to import a date from an-
other time zone or you ﬁnally
want to get up the courage to ask
your Facebook crush, let’s talk
about all the potential methods
you can use to ﬁnd the perfect
date.

There’s my favorite, the “I
asked you while blackout and
don’t remember your answer”
approach to ﬁnding the perfect
FD date. We’ve all been there. A
few Natty’s into the night, and
you’re feeling pretty good about
yourself. So you figure, I’m
drunk. She’s drunk. Let’s be
dates. However, when you wake
up the next morning, you find
yourself wondering a few things.
“Who did I ask?” or “What did
she say?” may be the questions
that plague your hangover. Don’t
worry, if your date is meant to
be, more than likely she’l1 re-
member asking and answering.
And if not, she is probably in
your 8 a.m. class waiting to laugh
at you first thing tomorrow
morning.

For those bashful folk out
there you can try the, “I’m stalk-
ing you via Facebook. Does it
scare you that I know your date
of birth and home address?”
method of finding the perfect
date for you. Okay, so maybe it
verges on stalking, but there’s
nothing wrong with making a few
new friends with the aid of the
intemet.

However, when approaching
your future date, I ’d recommend
not bringing up how you have
viewed all of their tagged pic-
tures on the Facebook over 100
times.

It will save you from some
socially awkward situations.

For those who are even too
shy to ask a random stranger that
you are stalking via the internet

to FD, you could always use the
tried and true method of having
your friends ﬁnd you a date. I
pride myself at finding great
dates for my friends.

Last year, one of my best
friends went to FD with a gentle-
man who found himself in jail at
the end of the night. I am quite
the matchmaker. Let me know if
you want me to work my magic
for you.

For those of you currently
avoiding a DTR, you could al-
ways use the “Let’s not deﬁne the
relationship. Let’s go to FD to-
gether instea ” method
to having the best
FD yet. I mean

  
 
  

SHE SAID

You think we would have
mastered it by now. I mean even
as freshmen we had homecom-
ing, Christmas weekend and
maybe even a fraternity formal
under our belt. Before that we
had prom, graduation formals
and other high school dances to
force us to ﬁnd a partner. Yet
why is that we still have not mas-
tered the art of ﬁnding a date?
Well I guess some of us have.
For those of you who have a boy-
fn'end— well, this article is not for
you. You don’t have to make any
sketchy late night trips
like the rest of us in

100k at it this our quest to ﬁnd
W 3 Y a Mr. Right or just
Y 0 U ’ V 5 Mr. RightN0w.
l'lO0l(Cd up F a n c y
With this Dress is here. I
girlafew said it. If you
hm55sWhY don’t have a
110i have date (like me as
another 20 of press time) then

around? You
already know
this person, and I mean

you don’t have to worry about
whether or not there will be an
awkward hookup at the end of
the night. This is the safe choice,
and in most cases, probably the
best choice. Also, do you really
want the girl that you’ve been
hooking up with to go with an-
other guy? I think not.

However, if all of these meth-
ods fail, you can always go with
the “We’re friends. Let’s go to-
gether.” method of finding a
date. Figure, you are going to
want a date. It’s a whole lot easier
than importing one.

So be a man about it and ask
one of your friends to go to FD
with you.

It’s a guaranteed night of fun,
and the night has endless poten-
tial. It won’t be awkward in the
end, and you will have a great
time.

You’re friends with your date
so she won’t get mad if you get
really drunk at the after party.

  
 

you have to resort to
some tried and true tac-
tics of assuring yourself a guy.
A wise man once told me, “Girls
don’t find dates, dates find
them.” I can see where he thinks
this is correct, but there is so
much in being found. You have
to place yourself perfectly be-
tween the frat basement and
nearest stash of Natty Light
within direct eyesight of the best-
looking and most fun dateless
guy at the party. Also a girl can
ask a guy to FD- yeah I said it.
It happens, but that’s not what I
am here to write about.

Now you must master the art
of positioning and location. Our
away messages become more
detailed than ever. You can tell
an especially desperate girl by
the way she lists her activities on
her instant messenger. You’re
not just at class- you’re at Span-

ish, then math, quick lunch, and
then back around 1:00. You
know not every guy will get the
hint that you are making yourself
easily accessible, but one might.
Just don’t go too overboard.
Then it’s borderline sad.

Next it’s time for the frater-
nity house shuflle. You’re just
increasing your hunting ground.
If you go to a house and come
up empty handed, at least get
yourself a drink for your good
effort. It was not in vain. Avoid
going overboard on the alcohol
on the days leading up to Fancy
Dress. You might say yes to aa
random person and then where
would you be but in an awkward
situation? FD is no place to play
blind date.

Do not import a boy unless he
is your boyfriend. The ratio is
close enough and the boys are
pretty enough. You can find
something here. I mean I guess
you could import a suitable boy,
but what would you do for din-
ner? You would spend the en-
tire night introducing him that by
the end you both would just be
annoyed. Also, you can’t hook
up with anyone else but the date
when you ship them in. That’s
just poor form.

Don’t be afraid of last ditch
efforts.
Thursday before fancy dress is a
perfectly acceptable place to ﬁnd
a date. You’re not desperate.
You know along with everyone
else that some guys don’t realize
they need a date for a date func-
tion until the night before.

Avoid a cry of desperation.
You always have your friends to
bail you out. Even if you barely
know your date, and you’re go-
ing out to eat with a bunch of
your friends, you’re going to
have fun. After all that’s really
what the night is about. And tak-
ing some fabulous party pics.

Down in the slumps

After the excitement of freshman year, sophomore girls feel the pain of neglect

By Ashley Hubbard
GUEST COLUMNIST

Last term was rough- very
rough.

I believe I actually interacted
with society, outside of class and
work, about ﬁve times in total. I
napped whenever I had a free
minute and could not seem to es-
cape a rather overwhelming
weight on my shoulders due to
either stress or an excessive
amount of cranial weight gain.

When confronted about my
recently developed isolationist
behavior, I would give my an-
swer: I am tired; I have endless
amounts of work to do, and Ire-
ally am just not up to it.

I was comforted when many
of my peers would give me an
understanding nod and pat on the
back like my mother used to do
when I would tell her the end of
the world was fast approaching,
but my comfort dissolved once

they kindly explained to me the
unavoidable cause of my plight.

The source of all my woes
was summed up by the fact that
I was a sophomore and a female;
a debilitating combination.

I was diagnosed with the
sophomore slump- the use of al-
literation indicates the high level
of education those who con-
cocted it possess.

I can only conclude that the
catchiness of the phrase is re-
sponsible for its widespread
popularity, or perhaps its popu-
larity is due to the concept’s
revolutionary premise.

For those of you who have yet
to be acquainted with the sopho-
more slump, it is the idea that as
a sophomore female I have lost
my appeal and am now in a sort
of, well, slump.

It was clear that I had grown
accustomed to the uncharacter-
istically high interest I received
from the male population during

The source of all my woes was summed up by

the fact that I was a sophomore and a female;

a debilitating combination.

my freshman year, and, because
my quality of life is wholly de-
pendent upon the amount of at-
tention I receive from the oppo-
site sex, it only makes sense that
I have had a hard time adjusting
to my new sophomore status.
The difﬁcult class schedule,
20-plus hours of workl clock per
week, regular volunteering, radio
show, sorority obligations and
general dislike of daily vitamins
had nothing to do with my ever
present feeling of blah.
Unfortunately, no solution to
this extremely healthy social
construct exists. There was little
I could do but sit in a dark cor-

ner and eat away my emotions
only to gain an additional ten
pounds which proved to even
further lessen my allure while
freshman women swarmed the
parties and monopolized the
male interest.

Theories like the sophomore
slump make me wish that our
little liberal arts school turned
out more psychology and soci-
ology majors than C-school ma-
jors because I think that society
at large could really beneﬁt from
the profound insight our school
has concerning what really mat-
ters in life.
