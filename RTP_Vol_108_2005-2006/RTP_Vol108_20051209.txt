evisiori, newspapers, maga-
radio, the Intemet. Today
are more ways than ever to
e the most up-to-date infor-
n on current events, and
students have access to all
these sources and more. Yet there
seems to be a common consensus
that these students are “living in a
bubble,” sheltered from the world
outside Lexington.

So are students sheltered from
life beyond Lexington, or do they
keep up with current events? Both
professors and students seemed to
agree that most students only keep
up with those issues that interest
them, which may not be the most
important issues on the whole,
business professor Amanda
Bower said.

Bower said that current events

cover a lot of issues, some of

which may not be the most perti-
nent stories.

“Current events are relative,”
Bower said. “You can make a
‘Tom Cruise is crazy’ joke", and
they all know what you are talk-
ing about. When the DC sniper
thing was happening, W&L stu-
dents saw white panel vans every-
where and knew it. And there are
current events about which 21-
year-old college students will be
more familiar than their
professor[s].”

Bower said that overall, her
students seem informed on many
issues, but that may be attributed
to more widespread sources, such
as advertising.

“Many of my examples in class
are marketing [and] advertising

‘based, and students frequently

Campus questions student awareness of current events

seem familiar with many of them
but to a large extent that credit
goes more towards the advertisers
and marketers than to individuals
in a class,” Bower said. “In terms
of strategic business issues, I’m
not sure how widespread the trend
is for students to keep up with that
information  but there are cer-
tainly students in each class who
frequently know what I’m talking
about. Others may just not pipe

H

up.

While Bower believes her stu-
dents are generally informed on
current events, journalism profes-
sor Brian Richardson said he finds
W&L students to be unaware of
newsworthy issues. When asked if
he believed students to be in-
formed on off-campus issues,
Richardson replied, “On the
whole, no.”

“There are some shining ex-
ceptions among the student body,
but most seem to have formed
concrete opinions already and
don’t seek out news that could ei-
ther inform or challenge those
opinions,” Richardson said. “In
their defense, it is true that news
media often don’t make clear what
young adults’ stake in an issue or
story might be.”

Richardson said that although
students may be up-to-date on na-
tional issues, it is important to
become more aware of local sto-
es.

“Student ignorance of sub-na-
tional government in particular is
profound and frightening,”
Richardson said. “Few can name

Tri-chairs
announced  

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

The 2004 Mock Convention
Trustees recently selected the
new tri-chairs for the 2008 con-
vention. Richard Friedman will
be the General Chair, Sara
Mueller the Personnel Chair, and
Wes Little the Political Chair.

Charlie Yates, one of the
convention’s trustees, explained
that “the selection process in-
volved applications last spring
and this fall, followed by [sev-
eral] rounds of interviews.” Tho-
mas Worthy ’05 and Anne Idsal
’05 joined Yates and former Gen-
eral Chair Noah Rhodes on the
selection committee. Professor
William Connelly, faculty advi-
sor to the Mock Convention,
mentioned that Worthy and Idsal
“both work this year on Capitol
Hill,” and that Rhodes “gave gen-
erously of his time as well.”

When asked how large his
role is in the planning process,
Connelly stated that most of the
planning is done by the student
tri-chairs. “Mock Convention is
part of a proud tradition of stu-
dent self-govemment at Wash-

Trustees announce leaders for 2008 Mock Con

ington and Lee,” he reported.
“Faculty play a largely passive
role. I give advice when asked.
Bob De Maria has been a tremen-
dous help to the Mock Con stu-
dents over the years with his tech-
nical expertise and with promot-
ing media coverage.”

Friedman, the General Chair,
said the new tri-chairs will first
focus on committee appointments.
“The primary concern is setting up
the steering committee  which
is made up of sixteen people. We
also hope to make State Chair ap-
pointments next spring,” he an-
nounced.

When asked about national and
local media coverage, Friedman
said the team “would like to see
C-Span do gavel-to-gavel cover-
age like they did either in 1996 or
2000.” He also hopes the conven-
tion “will get standard AP wire
coverage and even a blurb on
CNN or MSNBC. Since not too
many people watch C-Span we’d
like too see the other cable net-
works give us some coverage.”
Friedman went on to mention that

First strike or frats

IF C issues strikes to ﬁve fraternities

By Sarah Murray
REPORTER

 

The Inter-Fraternity Council
punished five houses last week
for alcohol-related recruitment
violations, the ﬁrst blot on a re-
cruitment season characterized
by well—behaved fraternities.

An IFC press release stated
that the fraternities had sent e-
mails to freshmen inviting them
to consume alcohol, “some-
times in a manner of over con»
sumption.” Kappa Alpha,
Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Delta
Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, and
Pi Kappa Alpha face two weeks
of social probation for the of-
fense. p

All the sanctioned‘fraterni-
ties received first strikes except
Phi Delta Theta, which is al-
ready under probation for a first
strike received last spring term.
According to Chad Thomas,
senior IFC justice, the violation

was not serious enough to war-
rant a second strike. In addition
to probation, every house will
pay a fine and attend an alco-
hol education program.’ ’
The investigations ;were
based on information submitted
to the office of the dean of stu-
dents and the office of student
activities. In keeping with the
Standards for Fraternities and
Sororities outlined in the stu-
dent handbook, the IFC prohib-
its any recruitment effort that

focuses around alcohol rather;
than other “positive pursuits,” I

the release said. ‘

The probation periods will

include the first weekend in

January, which is the last re- .’

between freshmen and frater-

nity men. IFC President Vi-shal

Sapra said that the punishments

were arranged so as toavoidi

affecting Christmas Weekend.
“In effect, we would be pun-

ishing the wrong people,”
Sapra said. “{Christm_as] Week- I
end is -a meaningful event to the a
women on campus as well as
the freshmen and we don’t
want to ruin it for them.”
Sapra said the IFC has re-
peatedly warned against send-
ing invitations to freshmen via
e-mail. I
_‘“There are some issues in
the Greek system that need to
be worked out,” said Jason
Rodocker, IFC adviser and di-
rector of student activities. But
he and Sapra agree that the co-
operation of the fraternities
helped the situation come toa
resolution. A
Sutton Ansley, president of
Phi Gamma Delta, said the IFC
is succeedinginpenalizing the
houses rather than the entire
7 system. -
“There are rules governing
thebehavior of fraternities and
sometimes you need to shock
certain members of the frater-
 into following those rules,”
Ansley said.

Jon Philipson on competing for Oxford scholarship

By Kate Shellnutt
REPORTER

On the Friday before Thar1ks-
giving Break, senior Jon Philipson
found himself in Birmingham,
Alabama. Despite being nine
hours away from his Florida home
and days away from the turkey-
ﬁlled holiday, Philipson was feel-
ing extremely thankful.

He spent Friday and Saturday,
November 19"‘ and 20“‘ compet-
ing in the district finals for the
Rhodes Scholarship, a fellowship
which provides two years of study
at Oxford University in England.

“The whole weekend was like
an interview——the dinner, the re-
ception, and then your own little
twenty minute slot,” said
Philipson. “People were nervous,
pacing and stuff, but I was just
happy to get that far.”

Philipson first became inter-
ested in the fellowship in March,
after politics professor William
Connelly suggested he apply.

Connelly called Philipson “a
natural for a Rhodes Scholarship”
as he cited Philipson’s academic
achievements, community in-
volvement, and personable nature.

Well—roundedness is the stan-
dard for Rhodes Scholars. Selec-
tion of recipients follows the
specifications set by the scholar-
ships’ namesake, British pioneer
Cecil Rhodes: intellectual ability,
moral character, and service. Ini-
tiated at his death in 1902, they
are the oldest international fellow-
ships.

Each year, regional selection
committees choose 32 American
Rhodes Scholars. Fifteen past
scholars have come from Wash-
ington and Lee.

“Rhodes always seeks the
brightest and most socially en-
gaged students in America,” said
Dean George Bent, Associate
Dean of the College. “Many W&L
students embrace the ideals sought
after by the Rhodes Trust, and

their academic abilities
frequently put their applications at
the top of the pile.”

This year, the University en-
dorsed 12 students to apply, and
Philipson advanced to compete in
District 7, according to his home
state, Florida, but was not selected
for the fellowship.

“At first, it was overwhelming.
I mean, you never picture yourself
going for this kind of thing,” said
Philipson.

He said all of his professors
helped him apply, practice for the
interviews, and advance in the
competition, while his fraternity
brothers were “extremely support-
ive.”

“They were even sending me
emails and text messages the night
before, wishing me good luck,”
said Philipson. “It ended up be-
ing the best interview I’d ever had.
I was myself the whole weekend.”

For Philipson, being himself
means balancing hard work with
humor and relaxation.

“Jon’s ready humor, coupled
with his insight, wit, and frequent
ﬂashes of insight make him an
ideal student,” said Professor

publicity for the school, and
it also lets candidates reach out
to the younger generation of vot-
ers.”

Mueller pointed out that one
person on the steering commit-
tee is entirely responsible for
public relations.

“In the past a journalism ma-
jor has often held that job,” she
added. Little and Friedman said
newspapers from across Virginia
and even the Washington D.C.

area would probably send report-
s down to cover t e con —
tiori.

When asked how the quadren-
nial convention continues to at-
tract high profile speakers and
candidate, Connelly pointed to
the strong media poi/erage.

“The W & L Mock Conven-
tion is the most successful such
college student exercise in the
nation. Prominent speakers
spawn media attention, and in
turn media attention attracts
prominent speakers. Politicians

“Usually about 90% of the students are involved with the convention in some way,
so this is really something everyone can participate in.”

Connelly.

Philipson doesn’t take himself
too seriously, but remains con-
cerned about others. His résumé
evidences his selﬂessness: start-
ing a peer-tutoring program for at-
risk youth in high school, volun-
teering with Head Start at Waddell
Elementary, coordinating the Vol-
unteer Venture pre—orientation
trips, serving as Hillel vice presi-
dent, working with pro-bono stu-
dent consulting, and participating
in many other organizations.

While he could easily boast of
his extensive involvement,
Philipson doesn’t. He focuses on
the progress of the different orga-
nizations and the ways they ben-
eﬁt others.

“He doesn’t just do commu-
nity service projects to bulk up his
resume: he gives of his time and
his energy because he recognizes
the obligations those of us who
have been born into good fortune
have to our society at large. He
doesn’t start programs because he
thinks it will earn him praise: he
starts them because he knows
people need them,” said Dean
Bent.

  On the Rhodes again 

Philipson translates this pas-
sion for service into political am-
bitions.

“Working with people at
W&L. .. has given me the under-
standing that politics is more than
the issues, it’s the people behind
them,” said Philipson.

Philipson remains unsure of
his plans after graduation, but all
options focus around his interest
in social change through politics.

“I’m applying to some law
schools. I’ve also talked with Jim
Davis-—he’s a W&L alum—about
working with his campaign for
governor in Florida,” said
Philipson.

A self-proclaimed “future pub-
lic servant,” he hopes to promote
education and social policy as a
Florida congressman or governor
in the future.

“I fully expect to see Jon in
Congress someday. I’ll be happy
to help him advance his healthy
ambition. Jon understands that
politics is a good thing,” said Pro-
fessor Connelly, who has helped
him secure his past two summer
internships in Washington, D.C.

In the meantime, for his expe-
riences at W&L and his opportu-
nities in the future, Jon Philipson
remains thankful.

“He doesn’t just do community service projects to bulk

up his resume: he gives of his time and his energy be-

cause he recognizes the obligations those of us who have

been born into good fortune have to our society at large. ”

PC or Xbox. Continuing from
its earlier version, Quake

SAE not only used 4 un-Christmas-like colors on their colums, but also apparently had problems getting their Santa up. Maybe Santa wasjust

Popular design? Rumor has it that these frats were decorated by B&G, instead of the brothers themselves. Sigma Chi, KA, and Kappa Sig all
dressed alike for this holiday party, making it difficult to tell them apart. Though the simple designs are nice, we find them lacking in creativity.

Wednesday night social scene ,

By Abri Nelson

STAFF WRITER

Christmas is in the air — the
first snow has dusted our cam-
pus, the Commons is decked
in red and green, and organi-

zations are packing all kinds.

of events into these last two
weeks. Despite all the deco-
rations, the regular activities
on campus continue. We still
have papers to write, exams to
take, parties to go to - and we
still have Wednesday Night
Live.

I can see all of your blank
faces — Wednesday Night
Live? You mean those bands
that play in the Commons?
Yes, those bands. But also the
comedy acts’ put on by stu-
dents, the laser tag on Cannan
Green, and the poker tourna-
ments. V '

Jason Rodocker, the Direc-
tor of Student Activities, con-
tinued the tradition of Uncom-
mon Grounds from last year,
but changed the name to
Wednesday Night Live to “em-
phasize the regular occurrence
of having something every

‘ Wednesday night.” The pur-
pose of the night is to give stu-
dents the chance to plan and
execute their idea for a fun
event — such as the laser tag

' and comedy nights.

‘ The problem comes in the
form of students not under-
standing what Wednesday

Night Live is. Freshman Julie
Petersen commented, “I’ve
never been ~ I don’t- know
much about it.” Sophomore
Will Chamberlain agreed, add-
ingthat he has too much to do
during the week anyway to go

' to anything.

Nevertheless, I Rodocker’
says that he has been quite
pleased with the turnout.
Some 200 studentsshowed up -
at the comedy night, which
featured sophomores Kate
Shellnutt and Kelly Harvey,
and senior Cody Gabbard. The
laser tag night was also a huge
success. ,

When asked about the draw
of off campus events, such as
Christmas in the Country,
Rodocker commented that he
believes that they draw no
more students away from
Wednesday Night Live than
studying or other organization
commitments do.

Rodocker hopes students
are able to experience all parts
of the college experience, but
in a balanced manner.

He hopes that more stu-
dents will continue to plan
their own events because that
is the purpose of Wednesday
Night Live and those are the
events that draw the most stu-
dents. Events arealways free
to students and convenient for
those on campus. Junior
Meghan loss‘ said, i“ I try to go
when possible...it’s easy to
stop by as a study break.” .

Rodocker hopes students are able to

experience all parts of the college ex-

perience, but in a balanced manner

What do you Want

This week’s Talkbacks was conducted by Greg Zimmerman.

Will Waller,
sophomore:

“I want the Braves to
win a World Series
Championship.”

Ashlee Metcalf,
senior:

“A new car, 1

that’s it.”

John Lindsay,

“Seven minutes in

erry holidays

Other winter celebrations should take a back seat to Christmas

By Tim Livingston
STAFF WRITER

As a Jewish student, I demand
an explanation as to the lack of
Hanukkah ornaments on campus.

Also, my African American
friends would appreciate some
more Kwanzaa decorations.
Lastly, a few Ramadan pamphlets
would also be prudent.

How can people make these
claims with a straight face? The
transformation from the “Christ-
mas” season of my youth to the
current “Ho1iday" season has been
an arduous road.

Actually the conversion hasn’t
encountered many roadblocks be-
cause the desire to constantly con-
form to the laws of political cor-
rectness has torn down all barri-
ers in the way of ostracizing any
holidays during the month of De-
cember.

Perhaps this overwhelming
personal statistic will help people
comprehend the humor within

America’s latest trend of not leav-
ing out any religions during this
present—filled month.

When I graduated from el-
ementary school in 1997, four out
of the six songs we. sang at the
Holiday show were Christmas
songs.

When my brother graduated
from grade school only six years
later, they sung four songs and
only one was about Christmas.
This is undeniably startling.

When asked a family member
in the audience commented, “The
Ramadan song was quite interest-
ing.”

Ah yes, who would ever for-
get those beautiful Ramadan
songs playing on the radio when
the Holiday season rolled around?

I mean no offense to Muslim
readers, in fact I would argue that
Ramadan (although I know little
about it) deserves more decora-
tions than Hanukkah or Kwanzaa.

Well maybe that’s an overstate-
ment, but considering Hanukkah
is probably the third most impor-

tant holiday in the Jewish religion,
and Kwanzaa was created in Cali-
fornia in the l960’s', I would ar-
gue that neither one of these cel-
ebrations deserve a song at el-
ementary school concerts.

On second thought, I ’m al-

ways game for a little “Dreidel
Dreidel.” But that’s it.

Considering that most people
in this country deem themselves
Christians, and Christmas is the
paramount holiday in the religion,
it should be understood why the
festivity is entitled to more atten-
tion.

There is nothing to explain the
distraught of people in the coun-
trywho strive to see a Menorah
for every Christmas tree or a
Ramadan song for every Christ-
mas song.

These ideas attempt to equal-
ize, but the audience is primarily
Christian.

What ever happened to at-
tempting to appeal to the majority
audience?

There is a reason why

Milwaukee’s Best doesn’t adver-
tise on the Home Shopping Net-
work.

The need to be perceived as
politically correct is not always
detrimental, but this time of the
year should be dedicated to only
one holiday.

Although every religion’s holi-
day has its validity, people need
to realize Christmas’ dominance in
December.

Whether Christian, Jewish,
Muslim or other, let’s all join
hands, celebrate the holidays, and
not fret about Holiday trimmings.

It’s vi-tal to remember that some
point long after Jesus’ death,
somebody made—up that Christ
was born on December 25th.

Although there is only a l/
364.25 chance this is correct, I
refuse to question details at this
time.

Instead, I ask all religions to
simply forget about your holiday
because Christmas is definitely
better.

Alito’s politics

Bush’s newest pick for Supreme Court should please both the right and the left

By Caley Anderson
COLUMNIST

My more liberal friends doth
protest too much the nomination
of Samuel Alito, who is quite
probably the next Supreme Court
Associate Justice.

While I personally side with
the social liberalism espoused by
many opponent’s of Alito’s nomi-
nation on issues such as abortion,
gun control, what have you, I dif-
fer from them in thinking that
Alito will interfere with precedent
on such issues.

Both sides rightly condemn
judicial “activism," the concept of
the judiciary establishing law
through creative interpretations of
legislative acts, often in deﬁance

of precedent and of existing inter-
pretations of law.

The problem with radically re-
interpreted law is that it creates,
in one Justice’s words, a “jurispru-
dence of doubt,” a situation where
the law shifts so rapidly that it’s
hard to determine just what is or
is. not legal or illegal.

There is, of course, some room
to read the law and the Constitu-
tion through aparticular lens, as
hardcore constructionist readings
of law are (despite what Antonin
Scalia says) impossible. Never-
theless, out and out Reconstruc-
tions of the law are unacceptable.

Usually this gets turned into a
conservative argument. Republi-
cans very often argue that the ma-
jority-liberal judiciary attempts to
circumvent America’s “true val-

Alito may be conservative,

ues” by reinterpreting the law to
their own ends. They give as ex-
amples the ideas expressed by the
9"‘ Circuit Court, along with other
courts that have handed down lib-
eral opinions.

There is some merit to their ar-
guments, though they often over-
extend their criticisms— most of the
decisions they point to are quite
well-decided. Often conserva-

tives are criticizing the politics of
decisions rather than their legal
foundations, which are invariably
quite strong.

Similarly, some liberals are
overextending their criticisms of
Alito. Their evidence for his po-
tential activism (principally, they
fear, against abortion), are memos
and other documents he wrote for
the Reagan administration which

showed vehemence on behalf of
very conservative positions on
social issues, including abortion.
They believe that he still carries
these beliefs and will use his spot
on the Court’s bench to legislate
against abortion, et. al.

Whether or not he even does
still carry these beliefs is in ques-
tion. People, especially conserva-
tives, tended to get very, very car-
ried away during the Reagan era,
and I have a feeling that Alito was
one of the individuals swept away
in the nonsense tide of extreme
conservatism. He is likely far
more moderate today.

And more importantly, even if
he is still socially reactionary, he
is not going to let his positions
interfere with his jurisprudence.
Like Scalia, and like Roberts, he
is a good judge who takes the law
as the basis of his decisions. He

please

may not be, as I had hoped, as po-
litically moderate as O’Connor,
but he is fair and as partial a nomi-
nee as one could possibly hope for
from President Bush. \
Instead of criticizing Alito,
moderates ought to be thanking
their lucky stars that some of they

REALLY activist conservatives,

weren't nominated. Some of the
names on the short list weren’t
even real judges— Orrin Hatch was
mentioned as a name, and (shud-
der) John Ashcroft was also ru-
mored to be a possibility. And we
all know what happened to Harriet
Miers.

Alito may be conservative, but
that doesn’t matter because he’s a
good judge. Politics plays a fringe
role on the bench, what really
matters is one’s understanding of
the law, and Alito has a very good
one indeed.

Abortion is ugly

Abortion is a stain on America’s history and integrity

By Jack Staunton
C0 LU MNIST

When one is convinced that a
massive injustice is at hand, when
one is convinced that an inherent
wrong currently occupies a
comfortable spot in our society,

times of slavery, and such was the
case during the times of the Civil
Rights Era. The stain upon the
integrity of America is apparent
enough from the fact that these
human rights abuses were allowed
to happen at all. This stain is made
even worse by the length of time
that it took Americans to raise their
heads and lift their voices to cry
out that bigotry will not be the
status quo, and that hate in any
form, but especially when
protected by law, is something
entirely unacceptable to our sense
of justice.

Let the cry of Malcolm X carry
through to the present-day. “It is
not a ﬁght for civil rights, it is a
ﬁght for human rights.” When has
this been more true than when
seven out of nine lawyers sitting

on a bench in Washington D.C. in
1973 decided that a small human
looking object with fingers and
toes, with an independent heart
that begins to beat by day twenty-
four after its conception, with an
organ system in place by week
eight, and with the ability to feel

resemble a human and is therefore
afforded no protection? For even
if one does not believe that small
human-looking object to be in fact
human, it is undeniable that one
day that “fetus” will take its first
breath upon emerging from the
womb, that it will let loose its first
cry, and that it will giggle its first
giggle.

This ability, this fundamental
right that is something we refer to
as life, has been denied to forty-
six million human beings, and is
being denied to one and a half
million more as each year passes.

This is an absolute atrocity and it-

is far past time that we do
something about it.

Forty-six million. Do not let
that number just pass you by. Do
not let yourself become

desensitized to it. A fourth of our
generation has been killed by
abortion. As Dr. Ely, the author
of “Israel on the Appomattox: A
Southern Experiment in Black
Freedom from the 1790s Through
the Civil War,” stated, “If the
horrors of the 20th century taught

Why is it that we now seem to be
moving backwards in our ﬁght for
human rights? Instead of ﬁghting
to further define the meaning of
human equality, we are now
fighting to define the value of
human life.

We have let our voices lay
silent for far too long. May God
have mercy on us that we have let
this horror go on for so long with
so little protest in return. We
speak of integrity, we speak of
dignity, we speak of honor. Well
then let us show that these virtues
actually mean something to us by
speaking out in defense of that
most intrinsic of all human rights’,
the right to live. When speaking
out in defense of life, your voice
shall be forty—six million strong.
Let it be heard.
