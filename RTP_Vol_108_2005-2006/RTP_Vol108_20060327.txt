  Faculty ready

for Ruscio era

President-elect
receives favorable
reception from
faculty and staff’

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

Three weeks after being
named Washington and Lee’s
twenty-sixth president, Ken Rus-
cio is eager to step into his new
responsibilities and return to the
institution he has been a part of
since 1972.

Ruscio, who graduated from
W&L with a politics degree in
1976, is leaving the University
of Richmond’s Jepson School of
Leadership Studies, where he has
been the dean since 2002. While
the Jepson School had 12 faculty
members and 200 students, Rus-
cio will now deal with the thou-
sands of people who make up the
W&L community: undergraduate
and law students, faculty, staff,

    

administrators and alumni.

“The Jepson School is an in-
terdisciplinary program looking
at leadership in society, teaching
students for and about leader-
ship,” Ruscio said.

When asked how he would
transition from heading a small
school to leading a nationally rec-
ognized university, Ruscio talked
about the Jepson School’s high
proﬁle.

“The Jepson
School is an in-
teresting place;
its impact is
not measured
by its size. It
has a national
proﬁle and is
the only school
of leadership in
the country. I
represented the school at national
and international forums and ex-
plained the school.”

Ruscio, who served W&L as
the Dean of Freshmen, the Asso-
ciate Dean of the Williams School
and as a politics professor, said
his long association with the uni-

Ken Ruscl

versity will serve him well during
his stay in the Lee House.

“I have a great love for this
place,” Ruscio said, “and I think
I’ve taken lessons of Washington

and Lee to helping me understand .

what higher education is about.
My involvement in the broader
world has helped me understand
Washington and Lee better and
helped me realize Washington
and Lee can be a model for liberal
arts in ways that the university
doesn’t fully realize.”

Ruscio believes his status as
an alumnus will help him with
alumni relations when the time
comes to make difficult or contro-
versial decisions.

“There’s more at Washington
and Lee that unites us than di-
vides us,” Ruscio said. ‘‘I want
to remind people of our common
purpose; there’s not much divi-
sion on fundamental vision and
purpose.”

Ruscio said that he thinks the
university’s fundamental purpose
is “preparing students to leaders

City water
contaminated

By Mary Chllds
STAFF WRITER

 

Lexington residents
have received a letter say-
ing that the city water failed
a health department inspec-
tion.

The letter, distributed by
the Lexington Department
of Public Works on March
17, detailed the violation of
the drinking water standard
to be levels of haloacetic
acids exceeding the maxi-
mum contaminant level
(MCL) of 60 parts per bil-
lion.

Lexington drinking wa-
ter samples had 94.8 parts
per billion.

The letter, required by
the state law to notify citi-
zens of such health‘ risks,
also said that excessive
amounts of haloacetic acid
could lead to an increased
risk of cancer.

David Woody, direc-
tor of the Lexington De-
partment of Public Works,
said that the risk of cancer

comes from drinking two
liters of the contaminated
water a day for 70 years.

He added that in cases
such as this one, Brita ﬁl-
ters and other water puriﬁ-
ers do not help.

The increased level of
haloacetic acid, or HAA5,
is a by-product of the chlo-
rine used to clean the water
supply.

“Basically, we treat the
water with chlorine to kill
the bacteria that’s in the
river water, to prepare it
for transmission and use by
the general public. There’s
also a measurement to de-
termine how much is still
left in there, and they felt
that the amount of chlorine
still left in the water was
slightly higher than what it
should have been,” Woody
said. “That’s where we
went into violation.”

Going forward, Woody
says that the Maury Service
Authority is looking into-

Sense ofdireetiori

Four theater majors put their skills to use
by casting, eostuming and directing One Acts

ByAbri Nelson
STAFF WRITER

What happens when you
take mayﬂies, a mailman, a
failing marriage and a dream
about an ex-lover and put them
all together? This year’s One
Acts, put on by the students in
Professor J .D. Martinez’s Di-
recting II class.

This year, four juniors de-
cided to take the class. Each
of them read at least 50 plays
before deciding which to cast,
rehearse and direct for the stu-
dent body.

One Acts have “always
been a laboratory for the stu-
dent directors to practice their
craft,” said Martinez. “Once
they are in rehearsal, I advise
only.”

Directing II is not a require-
ment for the theater major, but
many students choose to take
it to get a better sense of what
goes into creating a play and to

enhance their own acting skills.

“I really love performing,”
said Lauren Kampf. “I love
to entertain and make people
laugh.”

Kampf directed a play by
David Ives called “Time Flies”
about two mayflies who real-
ize how little time they have to

live on earth. Mayﬂies are a
type of fly that only lives for an
average of 24 hours.

“It captures how we have
to live every moment to its
ﬁillest,” said Kampf. She said
that she chose it for its quirky
humor and that she enjoyed
working with all the creative
people at Washington and Lee.

Auditions were held for
One Acts before the Washing-
ton Break. All the actors were
auditioned at once, and the
directors were able to choose
which roles they felt people
would ﬁt in the best.

“I feel that my cast is
superb in their roles," said
Michael Wagoner, who is di-
recting the play “Portrait of a
Madonna” by Tennessee Wil-
liams.

The play follows the psy-
chological downfall ofa 1940s
Southern woman who is feel-
ing out of place in her world.
She has a dream one night
about an ex-lover, and be-
corﬁes increasingly delusional
“until she reaches the breaking
point.”

Wagoner said that directing
has helped him to gain a better
understanding of theater as a
collaboration of skills, rather
than just being all about the ac-

tors or all about the directors.

Malinda Smith agreed. She
said that she has been amazed
watching everything come
together for her play written
by Randy Noojin, “You Can’t
Trust the Male.”

“I have an absolutely won-
derful cast,” said Smith. She
said that she chose her play for
its simple, but humorous, tell-
ing of a love story between a
woman and her mailman who
reads her mail and ﬁnds out
that she is taking a Spanish
class, so he signs up for the
class, too, so that he can ask
her on a date.

After casting and ﬁnding
other students to ﬁll the techni-
cal, lighting, costurriing and
stage managing roles on stage,
the directors moved to rehears-
als for their plays.

Students involved spent
time getting to know the script,
setting themselves up on stage
in a process called blocking,
and putting all the elements
together for the ﬁnal run-
throughs this past week.

“They need autonomy in
order to experience the chal-
lenges and joys of directing a
play,” said Martinez.

Sheryl Silvers is directing a
play by Eugene O’Neill called

A .

EMILY HULEN / Design Director

Cody Gabbard’s character confronts his wife, played by Elisa Turner, about her affair.

“Recklessness” which is about
a woman who is caught in
inﬁdelity to her husband by a
former lover. There is some vi-
olent action in her play, so they
set up a rehearsal to practice
combat ﬁghting outside of the
regular rehearsal schedule.
Silvers has been involved
in theater all of her life and she
hopes to make a career out of
it. This summer she is going
to be in New York as an acting

and directing intern.

Kampf said that she wanted
to keep her options open, but
that she would love to make
a career out of her acting and
singing talents.

Smith is graduating this
year. She would like to work
for the National Park Service
as a ranger, and she feels that
a lot of the skills she learned
through directing and acting
will help her in that role.

Wagoner agreed. He said,
“The real skills in directing are
organization, communication,
patience. trust and leadership.
These are skills that anyone
can use in just about any job
ﬁeld they pursue.”

All four directors said that
they were very excited for
the performances. Martinez
said, “It often ends up being a
wonderful and sometimes zany
night in the theater.”

While our school is pretty great, certain parts are in need of a facelift

HE SAID

So after spending the better
part of the last week watching
all three seasons of Nip/Tuck, I
started to think about how W&L
is really in need of a major facelift
on the Colonnade. .

Now don’t get me wrong. The
Colonnade is one of the coolest
things here at W&L. It is almost
even majestic.

However, as the strategic plan
outlined, the Colonnade is long
overdue for some overhaul. So
I decided to submit a few ideas
aboutﬁhow I would like to see the

.¢‘Colonnade improved for the bet-
ter.

While the Colonnade is beau-
tiful to look at, a historic appear-
ance on the outside doesn’t allow
for a historic appearance on the
inside.

The old desks that might be the
most uncomfortable things I have
ever tried to sit in are enough to
discourage me from going to class
on any given day.

I believe that all the desks
shouldtbe modeled like the ones
in the C-School. I took some of
the best naps in my life while try-
ing to make it through Politics
100.

So please help out my cam-
paign of being able to sleep
through class by make the chairs
comfy enough for me to catch
a little shut eye. Perhaps if you
_made beds an option for seating

I ,
~'Ti‘1 classes, 8 a.m. class attendance

would be a little bit higher.

It would be nice to able to
lounge around and just chill while
taking notes. You wouldn’t even
have to change out of your paja-
mas.

I’d also like to request large
classrooms. Not larger class sizes,
but large classrooms themselves.
That way, I won’t have to sit
down next to the girl I awkwardly
tried to hit on or make out with
the night before. T

here’s nothing worse than cop-
ing with the memories of the night
before, but having to sit next to
the people that you humiliated
yourself in front of is a fate worse
than death.

I’d also like to request more
comfortable lounge areas in all

of the building of the Colonnade.
Perhaps model them like the J-
School. '

Sometimes I like to hang out
in the J-School just to make use of
their plasma screen TV. Would it
also be possible to get more vend-
ing machines on campus? Maybe
even allow Starbucks to come
onto campus?

Nothing sounds better than
a few espresso shots while I’m
cramming for my ﬁnals.

And having a self-serve sta-
tion would let it be open 24 hours
a day.

I mean the Co—op is
only opened until
midnight, but an
all-night cof-

  
 
  
  
  

SHE SAID

This week I let my coconspir-
ator pick the topic, and due to a
recent addition to Nip/Tuck, he
came up with a facelift concept.
If we were given “x” amount of
dollars, what would we do to
change our beloved institution?

If anyone touches the exterior
of the Colonnade may their hands
whither and fall off. I love how
our school looks. I love when
people talk about how “pretty”
our campus is.

It makes the million

ask of a person to try and
climb all of the stairs of Newcomb
while painstakingly hung over.

Granted, elevators might in-
crease the tendency of packing on
the freshman 15, but it also might
increase the number of people go-
ing to the gym.

More importantly, it will also
set up the awkward situation that
I love to be a part of.

My personal favorite is when
you get trapped on an elevator
with someone you have met be-
fore but don’t remember their
name, or as one friend told me,
how she got trapped on a library
elevator with the guy that she
used to randomly hookup with
freshman year.

Also, I’d like to point out that
these absurd suggestions are in
true sarcasm and jest. I do not re-
ally expect any of these things to
happen, but after the fallout I re-
ceived from wanting to facebook
while at sporting events, I just
thought I ’d comment that these
are absurd suggestions meant to
be funny. Not real ideas I expect
to see happen.

Everyone always talks
about how awful it looks. And
when I’m pulling an all-nighter I
don’t want to have to stare at the
ugly brown and orange decor.

It is honestly depressing due to
half of the building being shut off
from natural light (the sun not the
beer). The other half looks upon
the outside world to face Woods
Creek apartments. I am not even
going to go there as I have de-
cided to stick to strictly academic
buildings.

Besides making the world a
better place to look at, this school
needs to also consider increasing
the size of bathrooms. I, as a fe-
male, know I need at least two to
three other friends to come with
me.

It’ s something we have been
taught from birth- there’s strength
in numbers. But it’s a little
crammed in there- especially if
someone else and their buddies
stumble in. We are solving the
world’s problems, or at least dis-
cussing the previous night’s more
interesting tidbits. We need more
room.

Speaking of bigger things,
why not increase desk size? I
often ﬁnd myself juggling three
things at once in a class and hav-
ing a larger work area would real-

ly help me out. That way I could
continue to take notes on what
the professor is saying while do-
ing my homework from last night
and preparing for the quiz in my
next class. If it’s an off day and
I don’t have pounds upon pounds
of work handed to me, a larger
desk would allow me to get that
little quick cat nap in when pos-
sible. The minutes will add up
to make up for a late night out at
Windfall.

What would also help me get
through those rougher days and
even rougher all— nighters, would
be easier access to those caffein-
ated beverages we so much love.
Whether it’s a diet coke or a cap-
puccino you long for at 2:00 AM,
a co-op closing at midnight just
doesn’t cut it.

When I need to be woken up,
I need to get to it fast. Perhaps
more vending machines on cam-
pus that can take cash and general
debit would be a good investment.
I know Chinese history would
make much more sense with one
of my beloved beverages in hand.

If there’s one thing that this
campus needs more than any-
thing, it is more parking spaces.
I notice it, and I live on campus.
People drive through the quad,
parking deck, and other random
areas numerous times in hopes
that a spot will open up.

In getting more spots we could
eliminate the rule that denies
those living in a certain radius to
drive to campus. Next year, come
winter term, that walk to the hill
is going to be looking longer and
harder each day, especially as the
temperature drops.

As a double major with art his-
tory, I would like to take the time
to bid farewell to Dupont Hall.
Sometimes it seems that you only
have two classrooms- one for art
and one for music, but you still
demand respect even if you are
opposite to completely tech—ed
out J -school.

On certain days when I am sen-
sitive to light, opening the door to
a darkened classroom makes my
day a whole lot brighter. Dupont-
you are truly sympathetic to the
plight of at least one student on
this campus.

In conclusion, demolish the
library, increase caffeine access,
make bigger desks, and please
do not hesitate to hand out more
phone numbers of your fellow
teammates on Monday Night

Standing in no
man’s shadow

Dr. Mimi Elrod continues to
play inﬂuential roles in the
W&L community and beyond

By Bree Melton
smrr wnmzn

As her husband grew to
be one of the most beloved
presidents of the univer-
sity, Dr. Mimi Elrod found
herself in the spotlight.
She said that the “rela—
tionship of a husband and
wife...plays out in a more
public way” when one is in
visible position.

She believes the rela-
tionship she had with Dr.
John Elrod helped to set
an example for the men
at Washington and Lee as
the school transitioned to
coeducation in those ﬁrst
years.

Elrod said she will not
take much recognition for
her inﬂuence on the uni-
versity.

She said, “I can’t take
a lot of credit for shaping
programs.” Since she was
“in a visible position,” she
did have a lot of impact on
how the university has pro-
gressed.

When she was ﬁrst in
Lexington, Elrod worked
closely with the Head Start
program until 1986 when
she started in the admis-
sions office. But coming
from a family that was
very politically active and
having her bachelor’s de-
gree in political science, it
was not long before Elrod
moved onto the political
scene.

In 2002 Elrod ran for
District 24’s seat in the
House of Delegates against
Republican Ben Cline. Al-
ways setting the example
as strong woman, Elrod
said, “Whenever a woman
does something that is tra-

ditionally a man’s role, it
shows [other women what
can be done].”

Though she was defeat-
ed in the close race, just
running was a victory, she
said. Elrod is still much
invested in the Lexington
community.

Today, in addition to
heading up the Summer
Scholars Program at W&L,
Elrod is on the Lexington
City Council.

With education always a
prevalent issue in her mind,
Elrod was appointed to the
State Council of High Edu-
cation Executive Commit-
tee by Governor Mark War-
ner in 2003. She said that
it has been a great learning
experience because, though
it addresses both public
and private institutions, the
focus is mostly on public
education.

Now that Tim Kaine is
the governor of Virginia,
Elrod hopes that she will
be able to serve on the
committee again as she has
thoroughly enjoyed the ex-
perience.

Elrod, ever an example,
said “You think you’ll go in
one direction in your life,
but you just don’t know
what direction life is going
to take you. You have to
embrace what’s in front of
you.”

Elrod has been a testa-
ment to this philosophy.
Education and poverty
have always been central
issues to her, and in her life
she as made sure to address
those no matter where she
was.

Finally, she gives this
advice, “You should do
what you feel is impor-
tant.”

Keeping high standards  

To the Editor:

As open-minded as the admin-
istration and faculty of this school
may be, they seem to be pretty
adamant on one point: lowering
academic standards. Two issues
ago the topic was the Posse foun-
dation. I suppose the idea is that
students from relatively poor eco-
nomic backgrounds should have
the chance to prove their merit
in an elite setting. I am actually
in favor of this idea; however,
it seems that interim President
Beckley would have us be open
to the idea of converting merit-
based money, which currently
goes to students with outstanding
GPAs, test scores and extracur-
ricular achievements, into ﬁill

scholarships for students who ad-
mittedly don’t have the GPAs or
SAT scores that others have.

Are we really going to reward
merit that has yet to be proved
over merit that has already been
proved?

Professor Gwyn Campbell,
as the Phi reports, summed up a
particular attitude that I think the
student body should ﬁnd disturb-
ing: “We don’t need to see GPAs.
I trust Beckley, and he trusts Pos-
se.”

This statement reﬂects the
thinking that there are some ob-
jectives—such as diversity—that
are so important that they’re not
up for real debate. Unfortunately,
this attitude is echoed by some

W&L students

should strive to
show maturity

To the Editor:

Your recent staff editorial
“advising” our newly selected
university president greatly dis-
turbed me. May I point out that
the presidential search commit-
tee solicited student input on a
variety of occasions. Student
liaisons served during the selec-
tion process. The committee also
consulted with student organiza-
tions regarding their opinions of
optimal qualities for a new presi-
dent.

Furthermore, may I sug-
gest that in order for students
to receive treatment as adults,
we must ﬁrst act the part. The
whining tone of your editorial
demonstrated both inconsistency
and immaturity. If students feel
they do not enjoy stimulating
conversation with their peers,

that can be overcome only by the
students themselves. By dealing
with our own problems through
student initiative rather than tum-
ing to the administration for solu-
tions to every so-called “crisis”
we will better demonstrate our
maturity. Thereby we will gain
the conﬁdence of the university

M community and we will success-
fully transition to holding greater
responsibility over our own expe-
rience at W&L.

Let’s not burden others with
our own failings. Rather, let us
take this new beginning at W&L
as an opportimity to recommit
ourselves to actively implement-
ing our ideals of academic and
community development.

students, who undoubtedly have
the best intentions. The statement
that “anything that brings diver-
sity to W&L is important and will
help us” just shows how overea-
ger and uncritical we can become
concerning major changes in our
university. I fear this may be
the result of self-righteousness
trumping common sense.
Recently, the faculty and ad-
ministration were apparently
overeager to lower W&L’s stan-
dards—even when such ideals
as diversity were not at stake. A
nine credit reduction in the core
requirements for graduation was
approved, without debate. I sup-
pose the justiﬁcation for this
move was that our core require-

ments are already quite extensive,
and that other schools allow their
students to focus on their majors
and become more marketable.

But the fact that other schools
prefer marketability to real edu-
cation is only a reminder that
the whole country is lowering its
standards. We should not follow
suit.

Even if I am wrong, and the
school is making the right de-
cisions, I don’t like the way in
which it is making them. As a
concerned W&L student, I would
like to think that our school could
welcome open debate. Or maybe
my standards are too high.

To the Editor:

I recently read the staff ed-
itorial “Phi suggests rules for
Ruscio” and have a question
about the “Don’t be a fundrais-
er” sub-section. You write “A
big problem with presidents of
the past (ahem, Burish) is that
they only cared about money.
Rather than actually standing
for something, they did what
was popular with the people
who offered the biggest dona-
tion. We need a president who
believes in what he’s doing,
not someone who believes in
the almighty dollar.”

Phi claims need
to be explained

Can you please give spe-
ciﬁc example(s) of when a past
president--Burish or other-
wise-- “did what was popular
with people who offered the
biggest donation” when this
stood contrary to “actually
standing for something”? I ask
because I myself am unaware
of such speciﬁc examples but
would like to be educated.

Thank you, and thank you
for your coverage of our new
president.

Development ofﬁce

Although not Div. I,  
sports remain strong

To the Editor:

It’s a shame that a paper
and speciﬁcally a section
(opinion) that was once so
rich in ideas and content,
with articles written by Mr.
Rule and Mr. Trout, has con-
ceded to publishing hogwash.
I am greatly disturbed by the
recent “Hot Topic” on the is-
sue of school spirit at athletic
events. Not only are the two
authors, Mr. Fahey and Ms.
Gent, wrong in their assess-
ment of Washington and Lee
athletics support, but they
make countless factual mis-
takes regarding what will
bring students out to events.

First of all, suggesting to
play Duke is by far the dumb-
est thing I have ever heard.
There are plenty of exciting
ODAC and non—conference
match—ups that even the most
inexperienced sport fans
can get excited about; for
example, recently women’s
lacrosse battled the number
3 team in the Metro region,
Franklin and Marshall. Sec-
ond, Mr. Fahey’s idea about
free giveaways at the door to
basketball games is already
in place at Washington and
Lee. For almost every bas-
ketball game this season,
upon entering one could pick
up a raffle ticket for a chance
to win great prizes such as
a $20 dollar gift certiﬁcate
to Wal-Mart (last time I
checked you could pick up
a case or two with that). It
might have been that this had
slipped Mr. Fahey’s mind as
there was no Facebook group
called, “I won a $20 gift cer-
tiﬁcate at an exciting ODAC
basketball game.” (For those
of you not familiar, ODAC
stands for the Old Dominion

stat ito

Athletic Conference. And
honestly I’m not sure if the
authors know that)

Ms. Gent’s point about
needing a guide to not only
understand the game but also
to acquire prime-time play-

ers -phone numbers seems
reasonable. However this
information is supplied in
other sources. Every Monday
at 8pm, 91.5 WLUR (which
also broadcasts a hefty per-
centage of sports games on
the web in case you can’t get
away from Facebook) there
is the Washington and Lee
Sports Report on the Monday
Night Sports beat. During
this time, all the Washington
and Lee sports action over
the past week is recapped and
a different Generals student
athlete is interviewed every
week. (Granted we haven’t
given out #29’s phone num-
ber over the air, but recently
we gave out James Madden’s
(#6) phone number and I’m
sure their are plenty of young
ladies, even my 16-year-old
sister, who would love to
have that number). And if
you really want to know why
a foul ball is foul, well the
Monday Night Sports Beat
is the only radio show to take
callers at ext.4995, so just
call in and ask.

There is really no rea-
son to not be out supporting
Washington and Lee athlet-
ics; all the resources and
tools you requested are there.
Just ‘cause you might be too
cool to paint your face for a
game doesn’t mean you can’t
come out and support your
friends, fellow students and
fraternity brothers and soror-
ity sisters. There are plenty
of students that do, so much

Alcohol policy works

Finally, students can stop
sneaking alcohol into Fancy
Dress.

If the board of trustees ap-
proves the new alcohol policy
proposals, school events such as
Fancy Dress and Mock Conven-
tion could have open bars with
alcohol available to students of
legal drinking age.

We think it’s a great idea.

Too oﬁen, campus security
simply turns a blind eye to stu-

dents swigging away on their
fancy ﬂasks.

This”<To’ntributes— to-the many
DUI and DIP ﬁnes ﬁlling the cof-
fers of the Lexington treasury.

Not that campus security is
responsible for underage kids de-
ciding to drink and act stupid.

But the new policy could help
the school encourage responsibil-
ity.

If the students who are 21 do
not have a reason to sneak straight

so that in the fall when I was
broadcasting the Volleyball
ODAC Championships at
Emery and Henry College
(three hours south on I-81)
that a group of four or ﬁve
students made the trip not

only to support the volley-
ball team but also the foot-
ball team who was in action
against the Wasps.

But just in case you have
not been able to pull your-
self away from stalking high ~
school freshmen and cre-
ating your social ‘timeline
on facebook, here is what
has happened this year that
should get you excited about
attending and supporting
General’s Athletics:

Fall:

The football team posted
a 7-3 record, claiming their
first seven win season since
1985. They had two players
named to the Don Hansen
Football Gazette Division III
Football All-America team
(Sitterson and Martin) and
six named to the Roanoke
Times College Division All-
State team. Field Hockey
won their first ever ODAC
Championship, posting a re-
cord of 15-6 and having four
Generals Named to ‘Ail-State
Field Hockey Team. Volley-
ball won their ﬁfth consecu-
tive ODAC championship
led by two-time ODAC play-
er of the year Christine Gla-
dysz. Men’s Soccer posted a
record 9-6-2 and had senior
defender Derrick Lott has
named to the National Soc-
cer Coaches Association of
America (NSCAA) Division
III All-South Region team.
Women ‘s Soccer qualiﬁed
for the NCAA tournament
and placed four Generals

liquor into a function and then
drink it straight, then they won’t
do it.

Many other universities al-
ready have this attitude about
student consumption. Emory,
for example, uses school swipe
cards to ID students for drinking
at events. ‘I

W&L cannot and should not
condone underage drinking, but
it makes sense to let twenty-one-
year-olds obtain alcohol in a sen-
sible manner.

It’s about time that the school
took a more progressive stance on
student drinking.

on the all state soccer team.
Both the men’s and women’s
Cross Country team won the
0DAC’s.

Winter:

Men’s basketball had a re-
building season but ﬁnished
with an impressive 91-68
win over Eastern Mennonite.
Women’s basketball played
their way into the confer-
ence tournament and gave-
thc number one seed (the #9
team in the nation) Randolph
Macon their biggest scare
by far. Men’s swimming
won the Bluegrass Mountain
Conference Championship
and sent seven swimmers to
the NCAA‘s. While Women’s
Swimming captured their
thirteenth straight ODAC
title. Wrestling struggled in
the conference tournament
but is program that is con-
tinuing to grow and get bet-
ter.

Spring: ,

Already this spring the
Men’s lacrosse team has
defeated No. 15 Ithaca.
Women’s lacrosse is ranked
number three in the South
Atlantic region. And Base-
ball is off to a solid start
with Senior Scott Gosselink
breaking school records and
Senior Dave Mackenzie add-
ing to his career record for
most times being hit-by-a-
pitch.

The fact is our teams
are good. So get 01? your
computer and stop making
excuses why you don’t go
to games. And if you really
can’t get off the computer at
least listen to them on 91.5
FM.

Andy McEnroe
Class of 2008

In the past, the school has had
the tendency to overlook student
drinking, either pretending it’s
not happening, or pretending it’s
not an issue.

This new policy, if approved,
shows that W&L is ﬁnally look-
ing at controlling alcohol use at
these formal events.

Student drinking cannot be
stopped, and frankly, it may not
be the school’s place to try.

Loopholes can always be
found in any policy, but the Phi
applauds the university for trying
to close one of them.

THE RING-TUM PHI - 5

 

.
BA RS

Here is the latest update on who ran afoul
of the law during the last few weeks. We

took a peek at this weeks police reports

to see what you ’ve been up to...

 

Don't drink and carry
Lexington resident David
Huffman was arrested on
Tues., March 7 and charged
with being drunk in public
and having an open alcohol
container. Huffman, age
A 21, was arrested at 9 p.m.

Suspended means
you can’t use it

Travis Montgomery of Buena
Vista was arrested on March
9 on charges of driving under
the inﬂuence. Along with the
DUI, he was cited for speed-
ing; he is accused of going 57
mph in a 45 mph area. Fur-
thermore, Montgomery was
charged driving on an already
suspended license.

Making a bad
evening worse

On Thursday, March 9 Larry
Freeman was arrested and
charged with a DUI. Of-
ﬁcer Riley of the Lexington
Police Department made the
arrest at 10:30 p.m. Three
hours later, at 1:30 a.m., the
forty-year-old Freeman was

charged with malicious as-

sault.
No underage imbibing

Katherine Lacey of Lexington
and Lara Koogler of Raphine,
Va. were arrested and charged
with being drunk in public on
Sun., March 12. The arrests
were made at 1:41 a.m. The
two 18-year-olds were also
cited for underage possession
of alcohol.

Assault and battery
Angie Davis was charged
with assault and battery on
Mon., March 13. Though
the charges were originally
issued by the Rockbridge
County Sheriff ’s Oﬁice, Of-
ﬁcer Fitzgerald of the Lex-
ington force delivered the
citation to Davis.

Try not to break thlngs
18-year-old William Ware of
Lexington was charged with
assault and battery on Thurs.,
March 16. The charges were
made at 8 p.m., and Ware was
also charged with destruc-
tion of property less than one

thousand dollars in value.

  Newalcohol review

University committee considers changes to school is substance abuse policy. A

By Jessica Shaw V
$‘tfE*'fF ww_'E‘R" as  .

   

 As rowdy, ‘intoxicated.

. students lined up for the pa-
rade to kick off Mock Con-
vention in 2004. a number of
male students decided to re-
lieve themselves on the wall
of a Rockbridge Elementary
School, exposing themselves
to young children. Situations
like these have warranted
a call for intervention with
regard to alcohol by the uni-
versity.

In 2001, the administra-
tion along with members of
the SIG comprised a concise
pamphlet, available online,
entitled “Substance Abuse
Policy”. Four years later,
students and faculty have
collaborated once again to
make slight alterations to this
somewhat vague document.

“We pulled together a
campus~wide task force,” EC
President and senior Charlie
Yates said. “What we came
up with was an outline for
further initiatives.”

This documented proposal is
awaiting approval from‘ faculty
andthe Board of Trustees with a
presentation scheduled in April.
If it passes, the new policy will
be implemented next Fall.

According to Dean of Stu-
dents Dawn Watkins, one of the
main goals of the proposal is to
relieve the SJC of small cases
leaving them open to spend more
time on cases where an immedi-
ate decision is not clear. She said
that at this point, too much time
is spent overseeing obvious vio-
lations such as drinking in the
freshmen dorms.

Yates said another major goal
of the promoters is to focus on
reducing high risk actions. He
said the school seems to be con-
demning any use of alcohol. He
also said they want to make a
distinction between those two
things as well as hone in on high
risk behavior.

Another main concern of the
proposal is redeﬁning and clari-
fying the “safe haven” use of the
campus Health Center.

University Physician Jane
Horton said she hopes students

will not avoid help when in need
of medical attention. She wants
‘the  to clarify thatthere '

' will be no repercussions for

seeking help at the inﬁrmary.

Some of the proposed ini-
tiatives include an expanded
safe ride program, elimination

«of alcohol from undergraduate
classroom buildings and broad-
ened campus activities without
alcohol.

“We saw a growing need for
clarity,” said chair of judicial
sub-committee professor Janet
Ikeda. “We can reﬁne some of
the many points and make it a
more eﬂicient process as well.”

The policy also calls for a
shift to individuals being held
responsible for violations as op-
posed to an entire group. The
proposal also clariﬁes the strike
system.‘

“Last year, students, faculty
and staff got together to see how
to put this together,” Yates said.
“The broad consensus was that
the structure we have is what we
ought to do.”

One important addition the
policy recommends a permanent

adviser with legal training for

the SJC. In the) consufuction

of this document, the group
brought in a consultant to ad-
vise them. ,

“[We hired] an outside
consultant [to discuss} trends
in higher education in terms
of the role of the university,”
Horton said. I

Watkins and Horton men-
tioned that the school may
attempt to bring alcohol back
to events such as Fancy Dress
and Mock Convention if dis-
tributed through a reliable
vendor and used responsibly.
However, they said they are
fairly certain events like the
tailgates will remain banned.

The main issue at hand is
the presentation and potential
approval of these proposed
initiatives. The chairs of this
operation are seeking student
feedback and support.

“We are relying on stu-
dent leadership to make this
work,” Horton said. “We
want student feedback and in-
put. Get in touch with student
chairs in sub-committees.”

Gospel Fest a success

Despite weather students put together
their successful annual show

By Katherine Greene
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

LEXINGTON—Theydanced,
they clapped, they sang.

When 39 students wearing
brightly—colored shirts shook
the rafters of R.E. Lee Episcopal
Church on Saturday, it was the
climax of a year’s worth of hard
work.

Joyful Noise, Washington and
Lee’s student—run gospel choir,
held their annual Gospel Fest
Saturday afternoon.

Though it practiced until 2
a.m., the group was enthusiastic
about the performance.

“They were shaking that Laf-
fy Taffy for Jesus Christ,” said
Mistress of Ceremonies Yvonne
Coker.

The performance included
several songs with the entire

group singing and dancing in
unison, as well as a ballet perfor-
mance.

Ashlee Metcalf, treasurer for
Joyful Noise, as well as a danc-
er, said that the dance ministry
worked late into the night on
their six-minute routine.

The group works hard for this
performance, she said. “This is
our big thing we do every year.”

Dean Tammy Futrell, who
advises the choir, said she likes
“watching the satisfaction” of the
students in the group while they
perform.

“I like seeing the look on their
faces when they know they’ve
done a good job,” she said.

Futrell said she was proud of
the students, who put everything
together themselves.

“I just hand over the credit
card,” she said.

The students plan the pro-
gram, invite the guests, organize
the food, coordinate the outﬁts,
and choose the speakers with
minimal help from Futrell.

Metcalf said that the group
started initial planning last year.
They usually plan for 150 attend-
ees, so they have to ﬁgure out
how to seat and feed them all in
their $3000 budget, she said.

The group gets some funding
from the Multicultural Students
Association, but it is not always
enough, Metcalf said.

“What we don’t have, we try
to raise,” she said, pointing out
that the group sold T-shirts on
Parents’ Weekend as a fundraiser.

Among the guests at Gospel
Fest this year was a Virginia Tech
gospel choir, who performed
twice.

Several other choirs were
scheduled to attend, but canceled
due to the bad weather Saturday
morning.

Not everyone was put off by

the weather. Lexington resident
Rosa Harris said she tries to at-
tend Gospel Fest every year.

“I just love the students and
their exuberance and enthusi-
asm,” she said.

Harris, a singer herself, said
she really enjoys hearing the stu-
dents put on a good show. She
said that she heard about Gospel
Fest through her church, where
Joyful Noise performs once a
month.

“They support our church, and
I support them,” she said.

Some said they had other rea-
sons for attending. Sophomore
Jack Jeong said he came to sup-
port his friends in the choir.

He added that the convenient
location was a plus.

“It’s not tough taking time out
of a good Saturday before ﬁnals
and walking a whole block,” he
said. ‘

Harris agreed. She said, “I
could have stayed another two
hours.”

Martyr
remembered

VM graduate Jonathan Daniels is
honored by R.E. Lee Episcopal Church
in a special Sunday evening service

By Stacey Grljalva
REPORTER

Jonathan Daniels, Valedicto-
rian of Virginia Military Institute,
saved a 16-year-old girl when
he pushed her out of the way of
a shotgun blast in 1965. He died
instantly.

On Sunday the girl he saved,
Ruby Sales, spoke at R.E. Lee
Episcopal Church, where Daniels
was a part of the young group.
Sales is now an Episcopal minis-
ter and, in fact, attended the same
seminary school as Daniels.

For saving Sales, Daniels was
named a martyr by the Episco-
pal Church and has his own feast
day.

“It’s like being a saint,” said
Nick Gorham, youth minister
at R.E. Lee. “He’s one of three
American martyrs ever. He made
an amazing sacriﬁce.” ,

Daniels, a priest—in-training,
was only 26 when he was killed
in 1965.

On August 14, the date of his
feast day, Daniels was arrested
during a demonstration. He had
just been released from jail when
he went to a local store with Sales
and another black girl. The group
was met on the porch of the store
by a man holding a shotgun who
refused to allow the group to enter
the store. When the man pointed
the gun at the teenaged Sales,
Daniels pushed the girl out of the
way and took the shot himself.

R.E. Lee celebrated Daniels’
life with a special service on
Sunday night, attended by Sales
and the Episcopalian bishop for
southwestern Virginia.

In conjunction with the ser-
vice, VMI awarded its Jonathan
Daniels Humanitarian award to
Ambassador Andrew Young on
Thursday.

Young was an ambassador to
the United Nations and worked
alongside Martin Luther King, Jr.

Although saddened by Dan-
iels’ death, King praised his sac-
riﬁce.

“One of the most heroic Chris-
tian deeds of which I have heard in

my entire ministry was performed
by Jonathan Daniels,” King has
said. “Certainly there are no inci-
dents more beautiful in the annals
of church history, and though we
are grieved at this time, our grief
should give way to a sense of
Christian honor and nobility.”

Daniels had been in Alabama
to register black voters and to try
to integrate the Episcopal Church
only a year after the Civil Rights
Act.

“[At that time], the South was
in a state of apartheid embedded
in law,” said journalism Professor
Doug Cumming. “It hid its brutal-
ity until confronted.”

Daniels had originally come to
Alabama when he joined King in
the march from Selma to Mont-
gomery.

After missing the bus back to

divinity school, he decided to stay ’

and work for equality. His school
allowed him to stay; he only
needed to return to the North to
take his ﬁnal exams.

“He perceived his work for
social justice as a mission, as the
Church’s mission,” said sopho-
more Dane Boston.

Daniels was arrested and killed
in “bloody” Lowndes County,
where the population was a ma-
jority black but dominated by a
white minority. . .

“[Bloody Lowndes] was
known for the violence used by
whites to maintain their control,”
says Charles W. Eagles in a book
he wrote about Daniels.

Only ﬁve months before in
Lowndes, a white woman had
been shot twice in the head when
driving home participants of the
Selma-to-Montgomery march.

Despite the danger, Daniels
stayed in the area.

“He was struck with what he
had to do,” Boston said. “He was
very much a proponent of justice
and individual rights.”

His death affected the civil
rights movement, the Episcopal
Church, and VMI.

“Jon Daniels was a ﬁnal touch-
ing demonstration of courage and
sacriﬁce,” said Cumming.

Water violation is
Lexington’s first

continued from Page 1

the plant treatments of the water i
and hopes to restore the balance
of enough chlorine to kill the bac-
teria but not enough to violate
safety standards.

The violation is the ﬁrst of its
kind for the city. In the past, Lex-
ington has tested the water supply
every quarter and has never had
a violation. Because of the clean
record, the Virginia Department
of Health allowed Lexington to
move to an annual testing. The
ﬁrst of these armual tests was
conducted in August of 2005,
which is when the violation was
found, and the Health Department
recommended that the city move
back to quarterly.

According to the American
Joumal of Epidemiology, levels
of HAA5 tend to spike during the
summer, particularly in August.

Woody acknowledged that the
time lapse between the sample
and the notiﬁcation of violation
was signiﬁcant. “Usually we get
the results in one to two months.
In this case, I don’t know why it
took so long,” he said.

Decreasing the levels of chlo-
rine in water treatment will not
expose city residents to dangerous
bacteria, however. Other bacteria
tests are in place to monitor those
levels, Woody said.

According to a report by the
University of Minnesota’s Envi-
ronmental Health Sciences School
of Public Health, a high dose of
HAA5 in drinking water over the
long term led to liver tumors, and
in the short term, was found to be
a neurotoxin.

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity is also affected, since it gets
its water from the Maury Service
Authority.

“You are our customers,”
Woody said.

W&L Dean of Students Dawn
Watkins heard about the problem
on March 23, ﬁve days after the
letter was sent out. Since on-cam-
pus students are equally as affect-
ed as those living off-campus, but
did not receive a letter from the
city, Watkins said that the school
sent out an immediate notice
which ran in Campus Notices on
March 24.

Regarding the delay in notiﬁ-
cation, Watkins said, “I guess it
makes some sense in, as I learned
from Facilities Management and
Dr. Horton [W&L’s nurse] when
I looked into this, there’s nothing
“emergency” about it, so perhaps
that explains the delay ﬁom the
city’s perspective.”

Woody said that correcting the
problem shouldn’t affect the wa-
ter rates for the city, despite the
cost of additional testing.

Challenges

contlnued from Page 1

and citizens for the kind of
world they’ll encounter in the
twenty-ﬁrst century, he said.”

Lewis John, who served as
Dean of Students from 1969-
1990 and now teaches politics in
the Williams School, has twice

hired Ruscio ~ once right after his .

graduation to work in the Dean of
Students’ office and once to be-
come dean of freshmen. He said
Ruscio’s status as an alumnus will
help him as a president.

John pointed out that the
school has not had an alumnus
serve as president since 1968-
1983 when Robert Huntley ﬁlled
the office.

John said that being an alum-
nus is “key in understanding tra-
ditions and values.”

However, alumnus status was
not a priority to everyone.

Law professor Brian Murchi-
son, who headed the presidential
search committee, said, “It was
less important that he was an
alumnus than that he’d had ex-
perience with a small liberal arts
school. He’d had experience with
our type of education.”

Coming into the search,
some staff members said that the
school’s sense of community has
been strained recently. Lyn Ham-
mett, an administrative assistant
and member of the search com-
mittee, said some of the problems
stretch back to John Elrod’s ten-
ure as president.

“The staff wants someone fa-
miliar with the things that were
going on here during the past
administrations,” Hammett said.
She cited payroll complaints as a
continual problem.

John Gunn, an emeritus pro-
fessor in the Economics Depart-
ment, said he thinks Ruscio is
the right person to deal with the
university’s problems.

“He’s an extraordinarily ﬁne
person with a gentle disposition,”
Gunn said. “He’s a consensus
builder. He’s very well infonned
with what has been going on here.
He knows there are problems
and is anxious to get to work on
them.”

Gunn also said that faculty and
staff reaction to the Ruscio hiring
had been uniformly favorable.

“The lower paid staffers are
very loyal to the institution,”
Gunn said. “They cared about the
process and are enthusiastic about
the choice.

Hammett said Ruscio’s hiring
will help solve some of the cam-
pus’s problems.

“Ruscio’s going to help, but it
will take a while for him to ﬁnd
out what’s going on here. He’ll
go visit with students and staff,
maybe just in informal sessions,”

she said.

‘‘I’m a liberal arts guy ﬁrst
and foremost,” Ruscio said.

Psychology professor David
Elmes said he did not see Rus-
cio being a C-School president.

“Ruscio’s a thoughtful per-
son,” Elmes said, “and he would
blanch at the thought of favorit-
ism.”

Politics professor William
Connelly said Ruscio wouldn’t
bring any extra inﬂuence to the
Commerce School. A

“He bleeds blue and white;
even as a politics professor he
had built bridges to science and
the College. He understands
the differences within the uni-
versity.”

Dean Larry Peppers also
pointed out Ruscio’s experience
with interdisciplinary programs
as an important factor.

John said he thinks Ruscio’s
time in that area will serve him
well.

“The variety of experiences 0

he has had at Washington and
Lee as a student, faculty mem-
ber, administrator in both stu-
dent life and academics make
him able to work with students,
particularly freshmen in that
difﬁcult year of transition when
they’re away from home,” John
said.

As a student Ruscio was a
member of the Pi Kappa Phi
fraternity, but he said he was
a social member at Sigma Chi
during his last two years. Gunn
said Ruscio spent most of his
time at Sigma Chi because two
of his closest friends, Bob Bal-
lenger and Michael Luttig, were
members there.

Ballenger now teaches busi-
ness administration at W&L,
and Luttig is a judge on the
Fourth Circuit of the United
States Court of Appeals.

Ruscio quoted former uni-
versity president John Wilson
when talking about his vision
for the Greek system.

“John Wilson said if Wash-
ington and Lee would maintain
the Greek system it would need
the best Greek system in the
country,” Ruscio said. “At its
best the system stands for ideals
and values.”

As Ruscio settles into the Lee
House and the president’s office
next year, students can expect
to see him around campus on a
regular basis.

He says one of his favorite
things is W&L athletics, and he
promised to attend every game
he possibly could. He also said
he would attend a large number
of events for the arts.

“This is my home,” Ruscio-

said, “I’m coming back home
to where I’m most comfortable.
You’ll see a lot of me.”

No rest for the weary

Women s lacrosse brings in tough non-conference teams to increase intensity

By Elllottwalker
STAFF WRITER

The women’s lacrosse team
didn’t face any ODAC competi-
tors last week, but they still man-
aged to play three games.

The team took on Williams,
Colorado College and Catholic
University last week. Although
none of the teams are in their con-
ference, they faced some tough
competition. Williams occupies
the 12 spot in the national rank-
ings while Colorado College is
ranked fourth.

“It’s a different type of aggres-
sion than some of the teams in the
ODAC,” said Megan Slosson, a
sophomore on the team. “It helps
you become more versatile and
well—rounded as a team by play-
ing them.”

The team started the week by
playing Williams last Tuesday.
The team narrowly lost by a score
of 10-9, but showed determina-
tion until the end.

“It was a good game,” said
Kendall Korte, the team statisti-
cian. “There was a little bit of
a lull in the end of the ﬁrst half

but other than that it was a great
game...they really came through
in the end.”

The Generals were down 7-
2 at the end of the ﬁrst half, but
rallied to come within one point
by the end of the game, notching
their last goal with only 12 sec-
onds remaining.

“Even though we lost, what’s
so great about our team is that
we can criticize the way we per-
formed so we can learn from our
mistakes,” said Kat Michaels, a
sophomore defenseman. “The
game just ﬁred me up for the next
game.”

Colorado College arrived in
Lexington with an unblemished
record of 5-0. The team has made
appearances in the NCAA touma—
ment for the past four years, with
a Final Four appearance in the
tournament last year. Colorado
was added to the Generals’ sched-
ule this year. The Generals didn’t
know much about the team going
into the game, says senior captain
Rachel Wallick.

Colorado played Williams on
Thursday, and the Generals took
full advantage of going to see
them play.

“You get a better feel for how
[a team] plays by seeing them in
person,” said Christine Bender.
“You can see what kind of plays
they run and especially for our
defense, they can see who the key
attackers are.”

Going into the game against
Colorado on Friday, the General ’s
strategy was “to come out strong
and play 60 minutes with high in-
tensity,” said Wallick.

The women won 15-7.

Without having much rest all
week, the team took on Catholic

on Sunday. Catholic’s record was
not as good as Colorado’s coming
into the game; they have posted
four wins and two losses this sea-
son. Catholic is known for their
aggressive style, says Slosson.

“Catholic is always a competi-
tive game...they are athletic and
love to compete,” said Wallick.

The women won it 21-6.

The Generals will take a break
from games until exams are over,
but will resume their season on
April 8 with an ODAC game
against Sweet Briar.

Weston said that she con-
tinues to play well despite an
injury.

Day is an aggressive
baseliner, and is also a great
supporter of the entire team.

Weston said, “When
she’s done with her match,
she busts out cheers from
her high school cheerleading
days.”

The team is led by two
senior captains, Lisa Mabry
and Patty Roberts. Mabry is
coming back from time off
to complete her senior thesis.
Known for her footwork and
consistent ground strokes,
Mabry is a doubles special-
ist. Weston said, Mabry has
“ground strokes with spin
that she’ll never miss.”

Weston described Roberts
as “an amazing leader and a
great captain, not to men-
tion a great tennis player.
She is always supporting the
team and giving 100% in her
matches as well.” Roberts
also has the game to back up
her leadership skills.

Will described Roberts

as a good leader who has been an
integral role in the team’s success
this year. She was the only cap-
tain on the team while Mabry was
ﬁnishing her thesis.

This past week, the Fab Five
tournament came to W&L, bring-
ing some of the best Division III
players to Lexington.

The Fab Five tournament be-
gan in 2001. The idea was to have
the top ﬁve teams in the nation
play each other. Over time, the
number of teams involved has
grown, with 11 teams here in Lex-

Fab Five Tournament challenges record

Of the l 1 that are participating,
six are ranked in the top seven
nationally and the other ﬁve are
ranked between 16 and 30.

Coach Cinda Rankin described
this year’s ﬁeld, saying, “The Fab
Five is the strongest Division III
tennis tournament in the nation.”

Timmis said, “Last year at
the Fab Five in California we
had good matches with Gustavus
Adolphus and Trinity, both teams
we will face again this year. “

As Rankin said, “It is a terriﬁc
opportunity for our team and we
are really excited to have such
good competition.”

Rankin said that the keys to
success in the Fab Five would be
“endurance, mental toughness,
and perseverance. W&L will have
to step up. We will be playing six
matches in seven days. We will
be playing the best of the best in
every match.”

Timmis said, “The great thing
about this tournament is that ev-
ery match should be incredible.
It’s a great honor to host this high-
caliber tournament. The matches
should be fun to watch and really
good competition.”

Applegate said, “It will be im-

portant for us to do well be-
cause it impacts our rankings
going into nationals in May.”

When asked about the
weather, Will said, “It’s going
to be cold. However, I don’t
think it will affect it much.”
She said that the team would
be used to the elements, un-
like past years when it has
warmed up earlier.

The Generals opened the
Fab Five with a win over third
ranked Amherst, winning 7-2.

Tabb said, “The win was
really exciting because it was
our ﬁrst real test this year. We
lost a great player last year,
but I think we showed that
we could still play conﬁdently
and make an impact.”

On Friday, W&L beat
ninth ranked Middlebury, 7-
2. The Generals then went on
to beat twenth-seventh ranked
Tufts 8-1 on Saturday.

The Generals still have
a match against sixteenth-
ranked Williams on Tuesday
at 4 p.m., ﬁnishing up the
tournament against ﬁfth-
ranked Gustavus Adolphus on
Wednesday at 4 p.m..

Tough losses
disheartening
after strong
start to season

Men is tennis falls to II -7, 8-0 ODA C,
following devastating losses to
Swarthmore and Washington College

ByM|keFahey
STAFF warren

The Washington and Lee
men’s tennis team was ﬁnally hit-
ting its stride, with two of their
star players back from injuries in
top form, all while being ranked
eleventh nationally.

The team faced a tough chal-
lenge last weekend against
Swarthmore and Washington Col-
lege, the former being nationally-
ranked.

Sophomore Tim Ross echoed
the importance of the weekend.
He said, “This weekend will be
huge for us. Both teams are in our
region, and if we want to get to
NCAA Regionals this year, we’ll
need to have a good showing this
weekend.”

The Generals were also with-
out singles star Jon Malooly who
recently injured his knee during
an IM basketball game.

Going into this big weekend,
Coach David Detwiler said, “I
would feel a lot better if I had Jon
Malooly. I feel like most of the
teams might be a little bit down
just like we are. I feel like it will
be a very competitive match.”

Detwiler said, “The weekend
is a big tell-tale sign. If we win
both matches this weekend, we
are looking pretty good. If we
struggle a little bit, it’s going to
hurt us. The best tennis we’ve
played so far was against Came-
gie Melon. We’re looking to play
at that level again.”

W&L narrowly lost both
matches by one court as Swarth-
more and Washington College
each won four while W&L won
only three.

The Generals now have a re-
cord of 11-7 and are a perfect 8-0
in ODAC play. The team plays a
tough schedule of nationally-
ranked opponents, which account
for six of their seven osses.

As senior Jordan Eichenberger
said, “So far this season we’ve
beaten the teams that we’re sup-
posed to beat and we’ve lost to
the teams that we’re supposed
to lose to, with the exception of
Denison who we’re deﬁnitely bet-
ter than.”

The Denison match was a re-
ally tough loss for the Generals as
three of their top players, Maloo-
ly, Anderson and Seth F eibelman,
were out with injuries and David
Shay, their number one singles
player, was out of town at his
grandparent’s ﬁftieth wedding an-
niversary.

Eichenberger said, “I think

everyone on the team would tell
you that we’ve yet to play to our
full potential as a team and we’re
looking to do that this weekend.”

As Detwiler said, “I would say
Tim Ross has really stepped up.
He’s working harder than anyone
on the team, as far as he practices
and he also has spent a lot of time
on his own time working on the
ball machine and his serve.”

Detwiler had nothing but
praise for his captains, saying,
“David Shay is playing his best
tennis since his sophomore year.
I hope to go to the NCAA’s with
him individually. Charles Ander-
son is a great captain. He is very
intense competitor.”

The Generals have had easy
7-0 wins against four ODAC op-
ponents over the past two weeks,
showing complete control of their
conference.

As Eichenberger said, “We
continued our dominance of
ODAC opponents this past week
against Roanoke and the other
teams and I think those matches
will provide a good tune up for
Swarthmore and Washington Col-
lege.”

For the season as a whole, De-
twiler said, “I would say we’ve
played pretty well. It’s been dif-
ﬁcult. We’ve had a tremendous
amount of injuries.”

However, with the injuries be-
ginning to heal, the team is look-
ing strong as it continues down
the stretch.

Detwiler had a good outlook
on the injury situation, saying,
“We have the joke with the train-
ing room that a lot of the athletes
get hurt on Friday and Saturday
night.”

As Ross said, “For the past
week everyone on the team has
played solid tennis and we’ve
come out with our perfect record
in the ODAC intact.”

Eichenberger added, “In the
beginning of the season we were
a little shaky against our ODAC

-opponents but as we’ve shown in

the past week we’re still dominant
in the ODAC. We expect to keep
improving as the season goes on
and win the ODAC tournament
and do well in the national tour-
nament.”

While the team had an un-
fortunate weekend, they are still
looking to the future. .

As Ross pointed out, “We
have Mary Washington which is
always a huge rivalry match for
us after ﬁnals, but after that it’s
just preparation until NCAA’s in
early May.”

After graduating only a

 In defense of Calhoun

University of Connecticut coach 3* ways questioned by media

When UConn advanced deep into March Mad-

ness, the team drew the attention of many

national media outlets. As a result of his suc-

cesses, Coach Jim Calhoun’s practices have

come under ﬁre in the past few years, despite

his denying any wrongdoing.

ByThomasG|ft
sun warren

In his twenty seasons at Con-
necticut, coach Jim Calhoun has
built one of college basketball’s
preeminent powerhouses. With
two national championships,
more than 700 wins, and an in-
duction into the Basketball Hall
of Fame under his belt, Calhoun
is arguably the most successful
active coach in the sport. His in-
tense on-the-court ﬂair, coupled
with his proven track-record of
winning, has earned Calhoun
the respect of countless coaches,
players, and fans.

This year, UConn is once
again a consensus favorite to win
the NCAA championship. Al-
though virtually no one questions
Calhoun’s ability to bring home
another national title, X’s and O’s
may not have been the only thing

on Calhoun’s mind as he headsed-
into the Sweet Sixteen this week-
end. Recently, there has been a
slew of accusations surrounding
Calhoun for perpetuating what
has been dubbed a culture of ethi-
cally challenged behavior in the
UConn basketball program.

In his online column, Gregg
Doyel of CBS SportsLine de-
nounced Calhoun’s “cutthroat
negative recruiting tactics” and
“exploitation of NCAA loop-
holes.” Writing in an opinion
piece, Jeff Jacobs of the Hartford
Courant called Calhoun a “bully”
and sarcastically remarked, “Win-
ning apparently entitles the man
[Calhoun] to treat others badly.”

Most of these attacks center on
two charges: ﬁrst, that Calhoun
allowed star point-guard Marcus
Williams to play this season after
being convicted of stealing lap-
top computers, but back-up guard

A]. Price was suspended for the
entire duration for involvement in
the same crime; second, that Cal-
houn somehow stole coveted high
school player Doug Wiggins from
St. John’s through unfair recruit-
ing tactics.

It is time to set the record
straight and to restore the up-
standing reputation of Calhoun.
These allegations against him are
not only false, but they are also
dishonest.

Doyel and Jacobs have long
harbored personal vendettas
against Calhoun because he has
refused to speak with them at
press conferences. Unfortunately,
these “joumalists” have decided
to use their personal dislike of
Calhoun as a rationale for em-
barking on unwarranted character
assassination of him. The
proof of this claim lies in the fact
that their accusations simply do
not hold evidential weight.

First, the charge that Calhoun
gave Williams preferential treat-
ment because of his star status is
easily refutable. Williams imme-
diately admitted his guilt after be-
ing confronted with stealing lap-
tops. In contrast, Price repeatedly
denied involvement in the crime
until evidence pointed to his im-
pending guilt. Different crime,
different penalty. End of story.

Second,thechargethatCalhoun
stole Doug Wiggins away from St.

John’s is unsubstantiated. When
Wiggins initially called UConn,
Calhoun and his assistant coaches
refused to talk with him because
he had already committed to St.
John’s. It was only after Wig-
gins broke his non-binding verbal
commitment that UConn started
recruiting him again. The recruit-
ing practices employed by Cal-
houn fell well within both ethical
parameters and official NCAA
regulations. Wiggins is a mature
adult who voluntarily made the
decision to attend UConn. No
one forced him to do anything
or go anywhere. Again, end of
story.

I have written to both Doyel
and Jacobs to express my con-
tempt for their libel against Cal-
houn.

Doyel did not respond.

Jacobs replied with an e-mail
in which he abruptly told me, ‘‘I
spread truths, not mistruths.”

To be sure, the facts indicate
otherwise. Calhoun may not be
the most affable; likeable, or even
righteous guy in college basket-
ball, but Doyel and Jacobs’ sanc-
timony is on a completely differ-
ent level. ' " *

And therefore, perhaps it is
Gregg Doyel and Jeff Jacobs, not
Jim Calhoun, who should be im-
pugned for “ethically challenged
behavior”.

season ranking

-ity at one point this season,
but he has pitched well recently
and has brought his ERA down
to 5.29.

These guys, along with soph-
omores Myke Mulhem and Jeff
Pharis, will have to stabilize the
bullpen and soon if this team is
to make a deep run in the touma-
ment.

Many players have expressed
their disappointment in the team ’s
overall quality of defensive play.

“We haven’t had a perfect
defensive performance yet,” said
Wesley.

Shortstop Ray Sweeney, for
instance, has made a handful of
phenomenal plays, but also leads
the team with 11 errors.

He hits a paltry .194 at the
plate, so excellent defensive per-
formance is imperative.

Fortunately Coach Stickley
has shown a great deal of conﬁ-
dence in Sweeney.

He has started all 19 games
thus far.

Certainly inconsistency has
not been the only culprit, as the
team has made errors all around
the inﬁeld and outﬁeld.

“Our defense has to be av-
eraging 4-5 errors a game, and

those are just the ones that are

ruled errors. There are countless

other plays we haven’t made that

we should have,” said Garland.
“If our defense doesn’t im-

prove, we won’t be going very
far in the toumament,” he said.

Despite the pitching and de-
fensive woes, the Generals are
talented enough to have won 14
of 22 games.

Along with improving their
defense and ﬁnding reliable clos-
ers, Parker says keeping catcher
Jordan Wesley healthy is vital.

“He is one of the more inte-
gral parts of this team, and we
need him to stay healthy in order
to succeed.”

Wesley himself remains con-
ﬁdent. He said, “As long we keep
playing with the intensity and
conﬁdence we’ve been playing
with lately, we’ll make a legiti-
mate run at winning the ODAC.”

“So far I think we’re hav-
ing a good year, especially in
the conference,” said Sweeney.
“But I think everyone would say
that we’ve lost some games we
should have won.”

He points to two games
against Virginia Wesleyan and
Bridgewater when the team blew
late-inning leads.

But he said he is optimistic
about the season.

“I think on the whole we’re
one of the better teams in the
ODAC.”

Players also agree that fan
support is greatly appreciated.

As Wesley says, “It’s a lot
more fun playing in front of
heckling fans.”

Pushing of strong

Women ﬁnish ﬁrst, men secure second in season-opening W&L Invitational

ByMIkeFahey
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee Track
and Field team has had an impres-
sive start to their spring outdoor
season. _

Coming off their best ﬁnish
ever at the ODAC indoor track
championships, the women cap-
tured the W&L invitational and
placed well at the Roanoke Invi-
tational.

Huntley Rodes said, “At in-
door ODACs, we had our best
team performance ever and we
are looking to take that even fur-
ther at outdoor ODACs. We have
met and surpassed the goals that
we set for ourselves as a team at
the beginning of the season.”

At the Roanoke Invitational,
the Generals set records and
scored points, capturing ten Top-
ﬁve ﬁnishes, while one freshmen
set two school records in the pro-
cess.

Freshmen sensation Stacy
Doombos set a school record in
the triple jump, recording a leap
of 34’6”, winning the event for
the Generals. She is also a threat
on the track. Doombos went on
to place third in the 100-meters,
running a blistering 12.84 sec-
onds and setting another school
record.

Doombos has dominated all
of her races, holding three school
records in the outdoor season.
As teammate Alysen Kuck said,

“The team is doing well, espe-

cially with Stacy since she is like
super-woman and does just about
every event.”

It was the freshmen’s day to
shine at the Roanoke meet as
freshman Stephanie Stelter cap-
tured a first place ﬁnish in the
400-meter hurdles and was fourth
in the 100-meter hurdles.

Doombos and Stelter also
combined with freshman Tara
Hildenbrand and sophomore Di-
ana Dozier to capture a second
place ﬁnish in the 4x400-meter
relay.

Kuck, a freshman, was a force
in the ﬁeld events, placing third in
the high jump and ﬁnishing fourth
in the javelin. Rodes placed fourth
in the triple jump.

Junlor Huntley Rodes’ triple jump at the W&L Invitational, which the women won overall.

As the season begins to hit its
stride with this past weekend’s
meet at Wake Forest, Doombos
said, “This season is looking re-
ally good. We are training hard
and getting into the short outdoor
season.”

On the men’s side of the track,
the Generals have been dominat-
ing their opponents from the start
of the season, placing second at
the W&L Invitational. At the R0-'

anoke Invitational, the Generals
had some great results, running
against many of their top rivals.
The Roanoke meet featured a
lessened squad, speciﬁcally. with
the distance runners, as coaches
Nate and Kris Hoey have allowed
each member of the team to take a
“training weekend” and work out
on campus as opposed to compet-
ing. .
At Roanoke, junior Ryan Edge

ﬁnished second in the high jump,
and sophomore Wilson Robin-
son and freshman Chip McCoy
placed third and sixth in the 400
meter hurdles, respectively.

As sophomore Steve Revoir

very well and achieved many of
the goals that we set for ourselves

Despite setbacks,
baseball excels

Team remains optimistic about season

By Tom Bush and
Katherine Greene
STAFF WRITER AND
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

At the season’s halfway mark,
the Generals have posted a re-
spectable 14-7 record. Particu-
larly impressive are their seven
wins in ten conference games.
While some pre-season predic-
tions of 30 wins (which would be
a new school record) might have
been a bit optimistic, the ultimate
goal of winning the ODAC seems
to be well within reach.

Sophomore outﬁelder James
Madden is having a great season,
including a .494 batting average,
ﬁve home runs, 26 RBI and an
astounding .909 slugging per-
centage. “James is just a hitting
machine,” says sophomore pitch-
er John Parker. “He trusts his
swing and plays with conﬁdence,
which is all you can ask for from
an everyday player.” Junior
designated hitter and outﬁelder
Richard Garland said, “James
has always been a great talent, he

just needed the opportunity to get
on the ﬁeld and show it.”

Garland himself has been an
integral part of the surging Gen-
erals offense, notching a .373
batting average.

Juniors David Miller and Jor-
dan Wesley, both expected to be
signiﬁcant contributors coming
into the season, have excelled at
the plate as well.

Miller, while bouncing be-
tween third base and left ﬁeld,
has hit .347 in a team-high 95
at-bats. Wesley is batting .333
with four home runs and 27 RBI
while starting all but one game at
catcher.

Senior first basemen Taylor
McConnell, expected to anchor
the offense, has been hampered
by a back injury this season.

McConnell has hit .319 with a
pair of home runs in 19 starts, but
has missed three games because
of the injury.

Although his back may not
ﬁilly heal for the remainder of
the season, McConnell has re-
turned to action this week.

While the offense has ex-
celled, the Generals have strug-
gled with inconsistencies in

pitching and defense.

Ace right-hander Clayton Ed-
wards has been sharp, posting a
6-0 record and 3.51 ERA while
holding opponents to a meager
.240 batting average.

Beyond Edwards, however,
the pitching staff has struggled to

ﬁnd its rhythm.
Junior southpaw Johnson
Brownlow had solid outings

against Emory & Henry and
Richard Stockton, but recently
allowed seven earned runs and
failed to ﬁnish the first inning
against Virginia Wesleyan.

Second behind Edwards in in-
nings pitched is Parker, who, at
1-3, has already walked ll batters
in 29 frames. '

In comparison, Parker allowed
just three free passes in 52 innings
a year go.

“It seems like every guy can
roll out on the mound one day and
throw great for ﬁve innings, and
then a week later look terrible,”
said Parker.

The Generals had also hoped
to ﬁnd a reliable reliever or two to
consistently ﬁnish games, but that
has not happened yet.

“We don’t yet have a guy who
can step in during the ninth [in-
ning] and shut a team down,” said
Wesley.

Vying for that role are a num-
ber of pitchers, of whom the most
consistent have been freshmen
right-handers Andrew Henderson
and Brendan Clark.

Throwing just 12.1 and 8.1
innings, respectively, Henderson e
and Clark have shown good con-
trol and the potential to see an in-
creased load down the stretch.

“Henderson and Clark will
have to throw plenty of innings
in the [ODAC] tournament,” said
Garland. “They will be crucial to
our tearn’s success.” ’

Other relievers that are ex-
pected to play a signiﬁcant role
are sophomores Steve Marcott
and Tim Livingston.

After a strong start, Marcott
has been inconsistent recently and
his ERA has slipped to 5.43.

Marcott said he had no com-
ment about his pitching.

Livingston’s ERA was inﬁn

James Madden has team is
highest batting average,

runs scored and hits while
baseball team starts 14- 7,

7-3 ODAC

By Steph Wlechmann
S T A F F W R I T E R

James Madden does not know
why he likes batting so much.

“I really can’t explain it. I re-
ally like stepping into the box.
I really like hitting the ball,” he
said. I

The sophomore outﬁelder from
Dallas’ love of batting is working
out well for the Washington and
Lee baseball team. Madden cur-
rently leads the team in ten batting
categories and is one triple away
from tying the school record.

For those baseball statisticians,
Madden’s numbers are startling.
Last season, he hit just .105 in 19
at-bats. This year, his current av-
erage is .494. It leaves fans won-
dering how he has improved.

“I made some changes to my
swing this fall,” said Madden.

“Instead of taking my hands di-
rectly to the ball, I try take my
hands in more rounded way to the
ball which allows me to get better
plate coverage and get good bat
speed.”

Madden bats ﬁfth in the start-
ing lineup, as a “sort of clean-up
hitter,” he said. In baseball strat-
egy, the third batter is usually the
best. Being surrounded by good
batters has also helped his stats.
“Everyone helps each other out,”
he said.

“James is one of the hard-
est workers on the team,” said
Andy McEnroe, fellow team-
mate and WLUR sports analyst.
“He worked all off-season in the
weight room getting stronger and
in the cages working on his swing.
Everyday he is one of the ﬁrst guys
at the ﬁeld and one of the last guys
to leave as he is constantly work-

ing on his swing.”

Head baseball coach Jeff
Stickley has also seen the dedica-
tion and work Madden has shown.
“He is in a groove now and he
is one of the best hitters in the
league,” said Stickley. “He has a
good attitude about his hitting and
practices — he keeps working on
his game and is not satisﬁed.”

In the upcoming weeks, the
Generals face tough ODAC op-
ponents Bridgewater, Roanoke
and Hampden-Sydney. Madden
does not like to stress himself out
before a game thinking about the
other teams.

“You can only control yourself
and how you get ready for the
game,” said Madden.

He starts out every pre-game
with the same throwing exercises
to warm up. And, he said, he al-
ways‘ sports eye black for confer-
ence games.

It is in the game where Mad-
den must change his style if he is
facing a difﬁcult pitcher.

“If the pitcher’s throwing
harder, you stand back in the box
and choke up,” Madden said.

He said the best way to think
about upcoming games is “not
overestimating anyone and
knowing you have to be on your
game.”

As far as the ODAC goes, he
said that there are a lot of good
teams this year. “Every confer-

ence game’s a challenge,” he said.
Madden is conﬁdent that the Gen-
erals are still going to give their
conference foes a run for their
money.

“We have a really good team
this year,” Madden said. “We ex-
pect to make a serious run at win-
ning the [ODAC] tournament.”

As for tying the triple record,
Madden is not ready to make a
prediction on when that will hap-
pen. “Could be tomorrow, could
be next game,” he said. “You

never really know.”

But, is Madden able to brea1-
the record?

“I’d like to,” he confesses.

But it isn’t his ﬁrst priority
“Breaking records is kind of 6
side effect of the game,” he said.

“Although his performance a‘
the plate and in the ﬁeld has beer
amazing,” said McEnroe, “James
is never selﬁsh, always putting
the team ﬁrst. James is a grea‘
ball player, a better teammate an(
an even better person.”
