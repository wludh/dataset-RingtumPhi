FROM THE EDITOR

Welcome back!

In thisﬁrst Back-to-
School issue, we want you to
start off the school year off
as informed, energized, and
prepared as possible. We sat
down with acting president
Harlan Beckley and heard his
thoughts on all the hot-button
issues on campus so you
know what to expect from
our administration. We also
included our special Guide to
Lexington on pages 4-5,
complete with a map, driving
directions to get you
everywhere you want to go,
and a fun and informative list
of our 25 favorite things to
do around town. Pull it out,
post it on your hall, stick it in
your glove compartment, and
hang on to it because we
really hope this issue will be
a reliable resource for you.

It’s the beginning of a
new year, and the Phi has
some exciting changes and
refreshing innovations in the
works. As Washington and
Lee’s oldest newspaper, we
will strive to be responsible
journalists this year at a
paper that we believe to be
smart, respected, real, and
trusted by the student body.
We plan to better mirror
student interests, since we
have been called “the voice
of the students” since our
first issue in 1897. For this
reason, we want to hear from
you. Please give us feedback
on what stories you’d like to
see from us. We are
expanding the staff and are
always looking for writers
and photographers who want
to contribute. Email us with
ideas, questions, or concerns
at phi@wlu.edu.

Thanks for reading,
Emily Hulen
Editor-in-Chief

Acting president Harlan Beckley will return to being the director of his brainchild, the Shepherd Poverty Program, when a new president is found.

Bend it like Beckley

Beckley kicks off the year with the students’ support and an ambitious agenda

You know him.You love him. And now that he’s serving as

W&L’s interim president, you want to know where he stands

on those pressing issues you really care about. We sat down

this week with acting president Harlan Beckley to hear what

he thinks about some of the hottest topics on campus.

By Emily Hulen
and Chris Lauderman
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF. CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

What do you want to see done
with the Greek system this
year?

I hope the Greek system will
remain healthy and thrive
throughout the year.

So, no major changes?
I see no major changes.

What was your reaction to the
new Princeton Review report
that did not list W&L as a top-
ranking party school?

We’re all relieved, of course.

_ But the Princeton Review is not
the main source with which we
would look for an affirmation of
the quality of Washington and
Lee. The Princeton Review will
say what they will.

What do you foresee in the
future of our alcohol policy?
Our alcohol policy will stay as it
is, for the time being... We will
have a mandated review of those
initiatives [this year], of which
the students and faculty and staff
will participate...

How many students will be on
that?

A number of students and a
number of faculty members and
a number of staff. There are
seven different subcommittees,
as I recall... This has been
worked out prior to my coming
to this office, by Provost
Williams and Dean Watkins and
the student leadership.

Sexual assault was such a hot
topic last year — how will you
address it this year?

.

We’ll indeed continue to provide
the kind of education needed in
order to prevent sexual assault.
We don’t have any intentions of
changing those policies.

Can we expect to see your
mark on the strategic report?
You can expect to see forward
progress on the strategic
planning issue, forward progress
that is a collective endeavor of
students, faculty, alumni,
administration and staff.

Has a master planner been
hired?

There is consideration for
bringing in a master planner, and

. the details of that, we’re

working with that project right
now with Vice President Grasso.

What do you want to
accomplish on campus this
year?

What I intend to do is to... we
intend not to tread water at
Washington and Lee this year
but maintain the momentum that
has been established already, so
that when the new president
arrives, she or he will inherit an
institution that has direction but
also allows that person latitude
to develop the issues that she or
he deems important in going
forward. Our goal this year is to
maintain momentum for an
already thriving institution.

How do you feel about the
Shepherd Program’s
development in recent years?
Ah, thrilled by the Shepherd
Program’s development in
recent years! I’m very happy that
Stacy McLoughlin Taylor will be
the acting director this year...

I’m thrilled about the progress...
before I accepted this position, I
had to make sure that the
Shepherd Program would be in
good hands. And I’m looking
forward to the events afterward,
when I return to being the
director of the program.

Philip Norwood has noted your
“ability to bring people
together, to meet and
surmount challenges in a
spirit of collegiality and
cooperation, and to direct
their efforts toward achieving
a common set of goals.” What
do you feel best qualifies you
for the position of interim
president and how do you plan
on using that to better the
school? .

Well, my hope that I fit those
fairly high expectations of
Rector Norwood’s but I do know
this faculty and I do think I
know the students from teaching
here and having spent 31 years
here. I also know a number of ’
alumni and I will work hard to
enlist to peop1e—staff faculty,
and students to help us move
forward with what we’ve been
doing this year.

As you say, you’ve spent 31
years here—how has W&L
shaped you as a person?
That’s a very interesting
question. W&L has given me
and I think a lot of the faculty
and students here the
opportunity to take initiatives on
our own and develop our
potential, and I am grateful for
what W&L has done in that
regard. So it’s offered me an
opportunity to develop as a
scholar and a as teacher and to
take on the challenges of the
Shepherd Program for 8 years.

What qualities do you think we
should be looking for in the
next president?

Someone who will affirm the
important core values of this
institution — the close

Beckley says
to be on the iookout for...

" thepmandated review of our
4~year-old alcohol policy

° progress of the Shepherd
Program on a national level

vsuategic plan

' a new president probably
between March andisept.

relationship between faculty and
students, the Honor System — I
think there’s a growing interest
among the student body in
service and civic engagement
and who will take new initiatives
affirm and develop our capacity
to provide new initiatives that
can help students develop...

Any guess on how long it may
take to find someone?

Well we can’t expect to find
someone probably before March
or April at the earliest, but we
can’t be sure—it’s an open-
ended process. We’re going to
wait to get the best possible
candidate. I don’t expect to
return to the classroom until a
year from September. We hope
to have a president in place
sometime soon.

I know it’s early on in the
process, but do you know of
any interested candidates at
this point?

Well, Emily, I don’t know who
the candidates are, but I do
know... Brian Murchison from
the law school is the chair of the
search committee and he will be
receiving nominations. Students
are welcome to nominate a
candidate, and students will be
involved in the search
committee. Students are
welcome to advise the
committee of the criteria they
think are important for W&L.

Students ask for
specific qualities
in next president

By Erin Julius
CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

Next weekibegins the search
for a new W&L president.

Board of Trustees Rector
Philip Norwood will announce
the members of the Search and
Screening Committee this week,
said Professor Brian Murchison,
chair of the committee.

A website has been set up so
that interested students can share
their thoughts about the search
process. Students can ﬁnd fur-
ther information and updates at
presidentialsearch.wlu.edu and
can email their input to
presidentialsearch@wlu.edu.

Murchison said an open fo-
rum is planned next week so that
members of the Washington and
Lee community, including stu-
dents, can meet with an outside
consultant, Dr. Barbara Taylor of
Academic Search Consultation
Service.

Student leaders already know
what they want to see in Presi-
dent Tom Burish’s successor.

“It should be someone who is
students-first,” said Drew Dav-
enport, ’06, a dorm counselor. “It
needs to be someone who is out
on campus,’ at football games
and in the Commons - someone
who isn’t just a suit.-”

Davenport said that last year,
Burish took Davenport’s hall of
freshman out for pizza. Sharing
dinner with the president of the
University made an impact on
the freshman, Davenport said.
“That wouldn’t happen at state
schools.”

Sonia Siu, ’07, works to help
raise money for the Annual Fund
and said she hopes the next
President already has strong ties
to the alumni.

“Contact and relationships
with student leaders is also im-
portant,” Siu said.

-- Recommended by Sara Duckworth,

Tired of the hustle and bustle
of the Fitness Center? Want to
get some solo exercise time in?
Gaines Hall’s basement features a
smaller, but stillfully-loaded gym
that is rarely used. Perfect for when
all the machines in Warner Center are
taken, and perfect for when you want
to blast your own music.

Haven on the hill. Solace can be
sought in the ravine between Woods
Creek Apartments and the main
campus at the library and Commons.
This natural haven boasts a stream,
woodlands, and is well-lit at night, as
well as being accessible from
anywhere on campus. Perfect for
meditation, martial arts, play
rehearsals, or just about anything
else.

Wake up and smell the coffee.
Show up at the Lex Coffee Shop
around 7:30 a.m. on any Wednesday
morning to enjoy live, impromptu
folk music with all theilocal talent
(including our very own Burr Datz).

Get ready for a scare. Leam
local Lex history by taking the ghost
tour. A must for freshmen not
familiar with Lexington.

A cut above. Salon 215, located at
215 S. Main St., is great for any hair
needs. The atmosphere is the best in
Lexington. Kudos for making males
feel welcome by having guy
magazines like Esquire in the waiting
area.

Have an art attack. All the art
galleries in Lex open up for wine and
cheese tastings on the first Friday of
every month, starting at 5:30 p.m. So
get in touch with your artsy side as
you snack, sip, and stroll the streets.

Hit the highways. Take a drive on
one of the many scenic highways
that run through Lexington. and blow
off some steam while taking in some ,
of the gorgeous views of the Blue
Ridge Mountains.

Get your sushi ﬁx. Stop by the
International Food Store, grab some
great sushi you can’t ﬁnd anywhere
else in Lex, and imagine you’re in
civilization instead of the middle of
nowhere for a bit.

The reel deal. Take a trip back in
time and enjoy a good movie with
good friends under the stars at Hull’s
Drive-in.

Fall in love with Lenfest. Give
in to your taste for the arts

and check out one of the many great
plays, operas, and concerts
sponsored by the school.

Lee Chapel without the blazer.
Although we all walk past it
everyday, few of us have ever
stopped and toured our own national
landmark, Lee Chapel. Take a peek in
and learn about some of the history
of our college and its founders.
Below the chapel is a small but
informative museum that houses
some historic treasures. Best of all,
Lee Chapel attire is not required!

Tales of the crypt. Many people
visit the Lexington graveyard to see
Stonewall Jackson’s tomb, but the

enticements of the graveyard reach

far beyond history. For the
excessively romantic among us,
bring along a book of poetry and
read it aloud under a willow. Or go
just before dusk to experience the
creepiness. A quick walk through the
graveyard puts your life and its
problems into perspective as you
realize that this too shall pass.

Cheap pleasures. Daily Grind
house blend with Splenda warms
you up. Pink Hut’s swirl with
sprinkles cools you down (best $1.30
out there).

Music of the night. The Theater
at Lime Kiln has great outdoor music
on Sunday nights, and the local
volunteers are a wealth of
information.

Who needs McDonald’s? Kenny
Burger is hands down the best place
to get a milkshake, fries, and a
burger. This ain’t bodily health, but
it sure helps the mental state of mind.

Cat’n Books. The cat, Annie, at
Books & Co. on Nelson Street cracks
me up. It’s a cute little bookstore,
but that cat puts it over the top.

Tangable support. Tracey at
Intimate U can ﬁx you up for any of
you Washington and Lee events.
Victoria’s Secret has nothing on
Tracey’s skill.

Bah, ruining my skin. Laying
out by the Ruins with shorts, in my
case 45spf, and a text book is almost
the perfect way to spend an
afternoon. It could be considered
studying?!

Goshen Lizarding. Laying out on
the rocks at Goshen and napping is
purely blissful. Wonderful drive and
plenty of‘natural beauty.

Raining cats and dogs. Didn’t
do so hot on a test or having
‘relationship issues’? Well go wash
a puppy at the SPCA and you’ll feel
a hell of a lot better. You’ll be
completely drenched and smell
horrible, but it’s a small price to pay.

Best views around. Drive to
Buena Vista and you’ll never again
complain that there is nothing to do
in Lexington. Comparisons can. work
wonders. Eat at Nick’s for Italian or
Canton for Chinese, then plan for a
night at SVU’s theatre to see talent
on a low budget.

Bagel Wednesday. Healthy
Foods gets Fresh bagels in on
Tuesdays, so you don’t have to deal
with Lendens for awhile.

Eat your greens. Not the biggest
meat fan? Healthy foods has the
best lunches (they’re big enough to
also be dinner) and they are all
homemade and right there next to
campus. The women who work there
do amazing things with beans and
rice!

A torrid love affair. The chocolate
cake at Joyful Spirit and the Volcano
at Cafe Michel. Enough said.

Late night pillaging. Wade
through the $5.50 DVD bin at Wal-
Mart to find some hidden gems at
great prices.

Anderson, Chris Lauderman, and Emily Hulen.
