Trustee discusses

university finances
John Farmer, Chairman of the
Trustees’ Finance Committee,
met with the W&L community
May 15 to discuss the univer-
sity’s ﬁnancial status. Farmer
reported that the university has
a $106 million operating bud-
get, an endowment worth $532
million and a $117 million debt.
Trusts controlled by outside
parties add another $248 mil-
lion to the endowment. Farmer
said W&L must continue to
grow the endowment to ensure
ﬁnancial stability. The cost of
ﬁnancial aid has risen sharply
in the last decade and a strong
endowment will also be needed
when the school embarks on

its next large building proj-
ects. Farmer said the school ’s
endowment was below the
average endowment of other
top liberal arts colleges but that
the university is still in strong
ﬁnancial shape.

 

   



Phi Gamma Delta
receives second

strike

The IFC has issued a second
strike to the Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity. The house will be
on social probation until Sept.
21, 2006 and will have two
strikes until Nov. 14, 2006.

As part of the social proba-
tion, no more than one-third

of fraternity members can
assemble in any location except
university sponsored events.
Furthermore, all gatherings at
the fraternity house other than
meals and chapter meetings are
not allowed during the social
probation.

The strike [was issued because
of a party held at the frater-
nity house on Monday, May 1.
Should the house receive a third
strike, a mandatory full year
suspension would result. Other
consequences of a third strike
are mandatory alcohol and drug
education and other penalties
determined by the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

 

Due to a copy editing error,

last week’s Opinions column,
“The lessons of Duke,” called
Al Sharpton a “race mongrel.”
The article should have said
“race-monger.”

Last week’s Behind Bars car-
ried a sub-heading called “Not
the time for a stoll around
town.” The heading should
have said “stroll” rather than
“stoll.”

The Phi would like to thank you
for reading the paper this year.
The ﬁrst issue of the new school
year will be published on Mon-
day, Sept. 11, 2006.

City sets dam laws

Lexington council approves ‘No T respassing ’signsfor dam at Jordan is Point

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS smron

One month after 16-year-old
Lexington resident Charles Volpe
drowned in the Maury River, the
Lexington City Council voted on
Thursday, May 18 to post ‘No
Trespassing’ signs at the Jordan’s
Point dam.

Volpe drowned on Saturday,
April 23 when he was swept over
the dam by the swift current.
Pinned underneath the dam by the

water, which was two and a half '

times higher than normal, he was
unable to swim to safety.

The new regulation will not
prohibit swimming in the Maury
near Jordan’s Point, but it will
forbid people from climbing onto
the dam at any time.

The city may also post Wam-
ing signs reminding swimmers
about the dangers of swimming in
the river.

Research by City Manager Jon
Ellestad and his staff discovered
that the dam has been owned by
the city of Lexington since 1940,
giving them the legal authority to
post the ‘No Trespassing’ signs.
Jordan’s Point Park and the Mau-
ry River sit on the boundary be-
tween Lexington and surrounding
Rockbridge County.

At the May 4 City Council
meeting, Mayor John Knapp re-
ported that several citizens had
called him to enquire about safety
around Jordan’s Point, so the
Council authorized the Physical
Services Committee-—chaired by
Councilman Jim Giarminy, to pre-
pare some proposals for the issue.
Ellestad told the committee that
while Volpe was not jumping off
the dam the day he drowned, the
practice of dam jumping — swim-
ming downstream to the top of
the dam, then standing up and
leaping into the chuming water
below — has become increasingly
prevalent in recent years.

Formerly the site of a waste-
water and sewage plant, Jordan’s
Point has become increasingly
popular, especially with teenag-
ers, since the plant was removed

A man ﬁshes below the Maury River dam at Jordan’s Point. A 16-year-old drowned below the dam last month.

and the area became a park.

Ellestad said that. both. he and
Lieutenant Steve Crowder, who
handled the Lexington Police
Department’s investigation of the
incident, were unaware that peo-
ple were jumping off the dam on
a regular basis.

The Physical Services com-
mittee came to the consensus
that swimming in the river was
not exceptionally dangerous, so
it decided not to recommend to-
tally forbidding any swimming at
Jordan’s Point. Ellestad said that
he and the police department also
did not think a complete ban on
swimming could be realistically
enforced.

Gianniny expressed aesthetic

., concerns, saying that he wants the

new signs to try and blend in with
the natural environment. He sug-
gested putting up wooden signs at
the site, but the other committee
members favored placing cheaper
metal signs that would be easier
to replace if damaged or stolen.

Some council members fa-
vored the idea of installing a nicer
wooden sign if the metal one is
not damaged or stolen for several
months.

Gianniny also broached the
idea of putting the signs near the
parking lot instead of next to the
river, but Councilwoman Mimi
Elrod said that she did not think

people would notice signs that far
from the «river.

Ellestad will now work with
David Woody, Director of Lex-
ington’s Public Works Depart-
ment, to determine the best loca-
tion for the new signs. He said
that the ideal place for the signs
would be directly on the dam but
that they could not be placed there
because they would quickly wash
away.

The committee also addressed
issues surrounding the city’s li-
ability at the site. Ellestad said
that if ‘No Trespassing’ signs
are put up then the city must do
a reasonable job of enforcing
the regulations. Since the park

lies on the line between city and
country jurisdictions, several
council members suggested that
the Rockbridge County Sheriff ’s
Department be asked to assist
with enforcing the ban on dam
jumping.

After several more minutes of
discussion, the City Council ap-
proved the placement of the ‘No
Trespassing’ signs by a unani-
mous vote.

With the measure ofﬁcially ap-
proved, Ellestad said he hoped to
install the news signs quickly.

“We hope to have the new
signs up within a week. l’l1 work
with David Woody to pick the
best location for them.”

Chief retires aft

Bruce M. Beard hands in his badge after long
career as chief of the Lexington Police Department

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDlT0 R

Thirty-six years after ﬁrst pin-
ning on the badge of a Lexington
police oﬂicer, Chief Bruce M.
Beard is headed for retirement.

Beard, who announced his re-
tirement last fall, will officially
leave the force on July 1. Lieu-
tenant Steve Crowder, a Lexing-
ton police officer since 1982, has
already been appointed to replace
Beard.

During his time on the force,
Beard helped the department
grow into a truly professional
force. The department received
state accreditation in 1998 and
was reaccredited in 2003.

City Manager Jon Ellestad,
who oversees the department, said
Lexington Police Department was
Virginia’s ﬁrst small police depart-
ment to receive accreditation and
for several years was the smallest
accredited department in Virginia.
Over 200 state standards must be
met for a department to receive
accreditation.

Beard said a lot of things, es-
pecially training for new oﬂicers,
have changed since he joined the
department in 1970. A Rock-

bridge County native who was
born in Collierstown, Beard has
never worked as an ofﬁcer in any
city other than Lexington.

“They pretty much gave me a
gun and a badge and put me with
a senior officer for about four
weeks,” Beard said. “That was
the extent of the training. In 1972
the state decided that all ofﬁcers
should have some training, so in
January I went up to Blue Ridge
Community College for four
weeks of training. Now ofﬁcers
take a 22 week course at a police
academy down in Salem.”

Beard, who graduated from
high school in 1962, worked at the
Bonded Fibers factory in Buena
Vista from 1962-1970, except for
a stint in the United States Army
from 1965-1967.

‘‘In 1965 I was drafted into the
Army and spent a tour in Vietnam.
I was with the 15‘ Air Cavalry Di-
vision as a helicopter mechanic. I
worked on CH—47 Chinooks.”

Beard said he had considered
going into police work after high
school but ended up going to
work for Bonded Fibers.

During his 36 years with the
department, Beard says he thinks
the police force has moved from

being a reactive police depart-
ment to a proactive one.

Ellestad said Beard had been a
stabilizing leader for the depart-
ment.

“He took over at a time of
great controversy — during the
early ’80s we had a theft scandal
— but he’s always looked at as an
honest individual.”

Ellestad went on to say that
Beard has built and maintained
excellent relationships around the
community.

“One of the biggest changes
he made was the establishment of
a Neighborhood Watch in the Di-
amond Hill and Green Hill neigh-
borhoods,” Ellestad said.

Lieutenant Crowder said
Beard’s personal integrity carried
over into the entire department.

“We’re the team to beat,”
Crowder said. “We’re looked up
to even though we’re a small de-
partment.”

Crowder will inherit a de-
partment that has seen extensive
turnover in the last 18 months.
“The ﬂipside to having no tum-
over for nine years is that retire-
ments all hit at once in the last 18
months. By the end of this year,
we’ll have lost all of our upper

r 36 years

level management except me,
[Sergeant] Bucky Miller and Fred
Smith, who’s been a patrol officer

here for a long time.”

The incoming chief 1 started
his law enforcement career in
1975 and has served in Lexington
and Clifton Forge, Va. Crowder
joined the Lexington department
in 1982, a time when the force had
too few officers.

“That’s when we were re-
ally short-handed,” Crowder said.
“We were working eight to 12
hour shifts seven days a week.”
After being promoted to sergeant
in 1984, Crowder was promoted to
lieutenant when Beard advanced
from lieutenant to chief in 1987.

“He’s eminently qualiﬁed,”
Ellestad said, “and the only one
in the department with command
experience, and I wanted to stay
inside the department because
we’ve had a great deal of tum-
over, losing all of our sergeants
but Bucky Miller in the last three
years. We lost lots of institutional
memory.”

Crowder and Ellestad said one
the department’s current challeng-
es will be ﬁlling the holes created
by the numerous retirements.

“Replacing the experience
will be tough,” Crowder said.
“Over 150 years worth has been
lost. We’ve tried to hire ofﬁcers
with law enforcement experience
and have had some success do-
ing that. but our recent applicant

pool is down to four officers and
none have any experience. It can
take more than six months to train
them, and between training and
equipment it’s a $50,000 invest-
ment even before they take their
ﬁrst solo patrol.”

Crowder said that the depart-
ment would probably not see
many changes after his tenure be-
gan, though he did emphasize that
he wants to stress strong commu-
nity relations.

“It’s important to go back to
the basics of seeing a police of-
ﬁcer outside of the patrol car.
The chief in a small town should
be publicly known, so it won’t
be uncommon to see me walk-
ing around the streets, going into
businesses to talk with people and
check on their needs.”

Beard said that Crowder and
Lexington’s other ofﬁcers will
continue to build and maintain
strong relationships with the
schools, students and citizens of
Lexington.

He said that while the city will
never be crime free, a continuing
challenge for the department will
be to keep the crime rate at its
current low levels.

Lexington’s long-time chief
said he’s enjoyed his 36 year ca-
reer with the police department.

“Even from the ﬁrst day until
retirement day l’ve enjoyed work-
ing with the public. I feel good
when I’m able to help people.”

It saves the rescue
squad a trip

Robert Moses, age 73, was
found lying in the road on
Spotswood Drive on Thurs-
day, May ll. Moses was
discovered near the Lexing-
ton Rescue Squad Building.
Squad members discovered
he had a large cut and a
bump on the left side of his
head, so Moses was taken to
the Stonewall Jackson Hos-
pital Emergency Room and

received treatment for his
head injury. Officers on the
scene determined that Moses
was demonstrating signs of
intoxication and arrested
him, charging him with pub-
lic intoxication.

Main Street, USA
Philip Harris, a 28-year-old
from Lewisburg, W.Va., was
also arrested on May 11 and
charged with public intoxi-
cation. Oﬂicer Fred Smith,
who made the arrest at the
intersection of Main Street
and Washington Street,
stated in his report that Har-
ris was showing signs of
intoxication as he walked.
The arrest occurred at ap-
proximately 10:00 p.m.

Nowhere to run
Lexington resident Anthony
Stewart was charged with
speeding, driving with a

revoked license and obstruc-
tion of justice on Friday,
May 12. Stewart, who was
originally clocked going 39
mph in a 25 mph zone on
Maury Street, pulled into

a driveway on Maury and
began to run away from the
ofﬁcers. Sergeant Mike
Frost, who had originally
tried to stop Stewart, was
unable to catch up with the
27-year-old man. Officer
Nathan Kesterson arrived to
assist Frost, and the two of-
ﬁcers found a witness who
had seen Stewart run by.
Stewart’s father brought his
son to the police station and
turned him in.

Angry at the Palms
John Hefferin, a cell phone
tower worker from Franklin-
ville, NC, was arrested at

l a.m. on Sunday, May

14. Hefferin was at the

Palms Saturday night and
was waiting outside for a
ride when Sergeant Bucky
Miller and Oﬂicer Leonard
Stewart arrived at the bar.
The two Lexington police
officers were responding to
a call from Palms’ employ-
ees that reported patrons
were refusing to leave the
bar. While Miller was
standing in the doorway of
the bar, Hefferin decided
he wanted to re-enter the
premises. An employee
told him that he could not,
so Hefferin began berating
the female employee and
Miller. After Stewart’s ar-
rival, Miller went into the
Palms to make sure the
disruptive patrons had left.
When he went back outside,
Hefferin was arguing with
Stewart. The two ofﬁcers
arrested Hefferin on charges
of being drunk in public.

 Powell says goodbye to campus

Assistant director of student activities will be missed by many as she moves away from Lexington

By Stacey Grijalva
S TA F F W R I T E R

As everyone prepares to say
goodbye to friends, there is one
more person to hug and promise
to keep in touch. Kristen Pow-
ell, assistant director of student

I. activities and Greek life, and her

husband Jim are leaving.

“I’ll be missing a friend, a con-
ﬁdante, a colleague,” said Margo
McClinton, director of the Com-
mons.

The couple is moving so that
Jim Powell, currently the leader

of Young Life, can work ﬁill-time
for a church. The two are also ex-
pecting their ﬁrst child, jokingly
referred to as Baby Jack for Jim’s
appreciation of “24.”

“lt’s bittersweet because
they are moving on to do things
they wanted to do but they’ll be
missed dearly,” said sophomore
Addy N g. - :

Powell is known for her work
with Panhellenic, various campus
activities such as Battle of the
Bands and from her involvement
with Young Life.

“She has the unique quality
of making you feel like home,”

said Jason Rodocker, Powel1’s
coworker and director of student
activities and Greek life.

If others think of something
to do such as an event, Powell
talked to the necessary people but
helped the student to do the event
by himself.

A 2000 graduate of Washing-
ton and Lee, Powell’s experience
as an alumna gave her great expe-
rience in preparation for her job at
the school.

“As an alum, you understand
the experience,” she said. “You
know the traditions and under-
stand the events. It helps to see

Freshman sets
up poverty panel

W&L student organizes local religious and community
service leaders to discuss the role of religion in poverty

By Sarah Klentz
STAFF WRITER

According to the United States
Census Bureau, over 35 million
people in the U.S. live in poverty.

Freshman Rosemary Boyle
said she wants to ﬁnd a way to
ﬁx it.

Boyle is heading a discussion
board to talk about religion and
poverty.

The discussion will be held in
the Marketplace on Monday eve-
ning at 8:00 p.m.

“My goal is to have an awe-
some conversation and learn all
the dynamics on the issue,” Boyle
said. “[I’d like] everyone to
start talking about it because it’s
avoided in classrooms. This will
be a way to get the discussion out
there.”

Four members of the commu-
nity will act as panelists to get the
conversation started. Some panel-
ists include: Ingrid Easton, found-
er of Campus Kitchens, John Phil-
lips, leader of Volunteer Venture,
Brur Datz, director of Religious
Life and Bill Kline, pastor at Lex-
ington Presbyterian.

The discussion format of the
presentation is particularly im-
portant in order to get audience
members involved, Boyle said.

“Around campus there are
not many discussions, there are
plenty of speakers who are ex-
perts in their ﬁelds that come,”
Boyle said. “I think it is critical
that, to achieve my goal of getting

“My goal is to have an awesome conversation

and learn all the aynamics on the issue. [I’d

like] everyone to start talking about it because

it’s avoided in classrooms. This will be a way to

get the discussion out there. ”

the student body to discuss such
issues, we have a discussion. Stu-
dents at W&L are highly intelli-
gent and learning from each other
is an opportunity that I believe we
should take advantage of.”

Boyle said that recognizing
the correlation between religion
and poverty is important in un-
derstanding both issues.

“Most religions teach human
dignity and that we should care
for each other,” Boyle said. “A lot
of times religion is the motivation
behind wanting to help the poor.”

Boyle is putting on the event
as a ﬁnal project for her Interde-
partmental 101 class on poverty.

Her professor, Stacy McLaugh-
lin Taylor, is the acting director of
the Shepherd Poverty Program
and encouraged ﬁnal projects
such as Boyle’s in order for stu-
dents to “explore issues in more
depth and connect them to their
co—curricular and other academic
interests.”

Taylor said any discussion
about poverty is an important one,

and Washington and Lee students
will be particularly interested
when it is coupled with religion.

“It’s an opporttmity for stu-
dents to explore a signiﬁcant so-
cial issue of our time and develop
their own opinion and knowledge
about this issue,” Taylor said. “It’s
of deep interest to our students
with the number of religions [in
this community].”

Taylor added that poverty is
something important for mem-
bers of the W&L community to
focus on.

“It’s easy to go through four
years at W&L without exploring
poverty ﬁrst hand,” Taylor said.
“It’s something we all know a lit-
tle about on surface level but it’s
something we should all explore
in more detail.”

Boyle urged students to at-
tend the discussion so a variety of
opinions can be presented.

“I encourage people to go so
we can get as many different view
points as we can, even if they’re
not religious.”

the big picture [for future plan-
ning], like the need for sorority
houses,”

Powell brings not only the
knowledge of an alumna but also
of a sorority woman.

Ng said, “She’s been through
the whole Greek experience and
so she’s invaluable to be in that
position.”

Before Powell moved to Lex-
ington, she lived in Dallas as a
muralist.

“She has these little skills
that she never talks about,” said
Rodocker. “Such as, I know she
plays the piano and I’ve seen her

paintings. They’re simple, emo-
tional.”

McClinton sums up Powell
with one word — talented.

Powell hopes that she has
made a difference on campus.

“I hope that I have helped de-
velop leadership skills in student
leaders, challenged the women to
stand up for things they think are
important,” she said. “I hope I’ve
helped them learn to set a goal
and respond.”

In her two yeas at W&L, Pow-
ell has made a lasting impres-
sion and leaves behind many sad
friends.

“Personally and profession-
ally, she is ideal to work with,”

said Rodocker. “She keeps you -

focused, helps you to do right,
and praises you when you do it.”

Her replacement has not yet
been named but McClinton is
hopeful that someone will be
hired by the end of the month.
Powell has been taking notes to
help her successor and had a few
words of advice.

“Take time to build relation-
ships and to ﬁgure out the cul-
ture,” said Powell. “The students
are so capable. My role is only to
assist and empower.”

Rape is always rape

Student questions columnists statements on the rape case at Duke University

To the Editor:

At ﬁrst glance, it appears that
Jennifer Sutton’s column (“The
Lessons of Duke”) in last week’s
edition of the Phi could be writ-
ten in a few short sentences. If
I had written the article, then I
probably would have written,
“Washington and Lee could face
a sexual assault scandal because
sexual assault happens at Wash-
ington and Lee.” Seems simple,
right? So imagine my surprise
at Ms. Sutton’s article, which ap-
pears to focus less on preventing
sexual assault than on preventing
accusations of sexual assault.

Before I begin with the bulk
of my letter, I would like to ad-
dress Ms. Sutton’s most confus-
ing claim. Despite their curious
irrelevance to the rest of her col-
umn, Ms. Sutton works in a few
not-so-subtle jabs at “race-mon-
grels like Al Sharpton.” Accord-
ing to Ms. Sutton, this emphasis
is the product of a “larger racial
game” that has been created by
activists. Ooooh, that Al Sharp-
tonl I bet he paid that witness to
report that players from the team
were shouting racial slurs at the
strippers! You know what, he
probably also orchestrated that
thing in Washington, D.C. a few
months ago where one of the de-
fendants allegedly took part in
the beating of a gay man while
yelling homosexual slurs, just for
good measure! That Al Sharpton!
I can’t believe that he is trying
to make race an issue here! All
satire aside, it is Ms. Sutton—not
Reverend Sharpton—who most

clearly illustrates that Americans
are thinking about race in con-
junction with this scandal: “If the
accused are guilty, then they have
desecrated the name of all Cau-
casian suburban athletes at top
schools.”

Although Sutton is correct in
pointing out that a “tragedy” has
occurred in Durham, the focus of
her column is misplaced. Since
we are talking about accusations
of sexual assault, many readers
might assume that the tragedy of
the situation is that a woman ar-
rived at a hospital with injuries
consistent with having been raped
and forcibly sodomized. But Ms.
Sutton presents a different angle.
In order to prevent this “scenario”
from occurring at Washington and
Lee, we need to “know better...
[than] to call up local strippers.”
What? That’s how we should pre-
vent this tragic scenario from hap-
pening here? Since this solution
is clearly not tailored to the vast
majority of sexual assault cases, I
am left to assume that Ms. Sutton
is aiming at another sort of trag-
edy: wrongful accusations.

Let’s analyze this claim a little
more thoroughly. I should start
oﬁ" by reporting a statistic that all
of us should know already thanks
to One-In-Four: The FBI esti-
mates that only about 2 percent
of rape cases are shown to be fab-
ricated or untrue. With that said,
Ms. Sutton’s claims that “time
lines” might prove the defendants
to be innocent are far from air-
tight. This argument relies on a
discrepancy of about 15 minutes

If I had written the article, then I probably

would have written, “Washington and Lee could

face a sexual assault scandal because sexual as-

sault happens at Washington and Lee. ”
 

that exists between the time that
the crime allegedly took place and
the time that an eyewitness says he
saw the ﬁrst two defendants leave
the scene. We should remind our-
selves that this timeline and all
of the evidence accompanying it
have been offered by the defense
and have not yet been challenged
in court. Ms. Sutton. also claimed
that the alleged victim in this case
has made “prior false accusa-
tions” of rape. While the victim
did apparently accuse three men
of raping and beating her when
she was 14, the police chief in
the town in which the report was
made (Creedmoor, N.C.) stated in
an April 28 interview that it ap-
pears that charges were not ﬁled
in that case because this woman
decided “not to pursue the...case
further.” It is not uncommon for
a rape victim to decide not to take
legal action, and that doing so is
more likely to be evidence of the
emotional trauma that accompa-
nies sexual assault than evidence
of false allegation.

Still, Ms. Sutton goes even
further out into the deep end,
claiming that sexual assault while
under the inﬂuence of alcohol is
perhaps not sexual assault at all.

If you're like most Washington & Lee seniors, your college career has been packed with accomplishment
and excitement. Believe it or not, what happens after you graduate can be even better.

Well, if they raped someone while
they were drunk, then I would say
that their crime is rape. Can you
imagine how absurd Ms. Sutton’s
justiﬁcation might sound if it were
used for other criminal acts?

I’m really sorry, oﬂicer. I
didn’t mean to drink and drive,
but I ’m drunk! I can’! make ra-
tional decisions! T hanks for being
so understanding!

It seems as though Ms. Sutton
has a hard time accepting that we
are still responsible for criminal
actions when we are drunk. If
students are worried about los-
ing control, then why not cut the
drinking back or use the buddy
system? But Ms. Sutton is still
unconvinced. “In an instance like
this, should inebriation equal au-
tomatic guilt?” Inebriation? No.
Rape? Yes.

Since Ms. Sutton offers advice
to people who want to get trashed
and hook up but who are worried
about getting accused of rape, I
hope that I can offer some of my
own: Don’t rape people. Control
your life a little. You can do it.
Really.

To the Editor:

Congratulations to the
Ring-tum Phi for publishing
the comments of the Con-
cerned Parent. Nothing like
a little discussion about who
gets in and who doesn’t to stir
the masses. It certainly got
everyone off the couch and
into the game so to speak. I
had plarmed to write you af-
ter the initial appearance of
the ﬁrst letter. It was best I
waited to see the small ﬁre-
storm it created before mak-
ing a comment. Like many of
those who have written, allow
me to provide my stats: I’m
the father of a student — Class
of 2008 and hopefully Class
of 2011. I’m ﬁmdamentally
a liberal by nature but willing
to listen to the “other side” of
any argument. I graduated
from Lehigh, Class of 1976,
and probably wouldn’t get in
today.

I sensed in many of the
well-written letters there was
a desire for disclosure - as in
“if the University just came
forward with what we want
to know then we wouldn’t
be concerned about whether
unworthy people are being
admitted”. As a resident
of Virginia, I can state that
schools like UVa, James
Madison and William and
Mary are forced to play a
numbers game tied to their
status as “state schools”. In
those instances the decisions
are much more metric; they
don’t have the luxury of re-
ally looking at the “worth” of
a potential student.

The great thing about an
institution like Washington
and Lee is they can operate
under their own goals and
objectives. I would like to
suggest to those that have
written, they acknowledge
that the aspect of deciding
who gets in and who doesn’t
with a business oriented
mindset. Those writing the
letters should consider them-
selves as board members of
a corporation. As such, they
are entrusting the corporation
to individuals they believe
best represent their interests.
Most corporate boards don’t
micro-manage the people
they are paying to run the
business--why would they?
Do we really want to know
all of the details of the “ad-
missions scorecard?” Do we
really want to argue whether
a superior SAT score trumps
someone who is president of
their class but doesn’t have a
1400?

As parents, we are
thrilled our son is attending
W&L. On certain criteria he
shouldn’t have gotten in. On
other criteria he should have.
The same can be said for our
daughter who will apply next
year. Suffice it to say we re-
spect the “black box” process
that all universities employ.
If you don’t like the direction
the university is taking (over
time) then change the manag-
ers, but don’t micro-manage
the process.

Seniors Garner, Greiner, Hibbard and Strother

plan to use the grant money to spend next year

abroad in pursuit of their academic interests

while teaching English to local students in class-

rooms in France, Germany and Spain.

ByAbrI Nelson

Four Washington and Lee se-
niors will be taking their skills
to Europe next fall as recipients
of the Fulbright Scholarship for
graduate study.

Meg Garner, Gwen Greiner,
Meredith Hibbard and Meg
Strother each received a nine-
month grant to teach overseas.

Garner and Greiner will be
teaching in France, while Hib-
bard will be teaching in Ger1na—
ny and Strother will be teaching
in Spain.

According to its website, the
Fulbright has been awarded to
graduating seniors since it was
signed into law in 1946.

It was developed as a way to
promote “mutual understanding
between the people of the Unit-
ed States and the people of other
countries of the world.”

The grant supplies trans-
portation abroad, a monthly al-
lowance and covers the cost of
books.

The Fulbright enables the
winner to immerse herself fully
in the culture of the nation while
continuing her education.

Many recipients of the Ful-
bright teach English in a class-
room while pursuing a personal
program of research based on
their individual interests.

“My teaching will occupy 12
hours per week, and the other
time there I will spend working
on my project, an extracurricu-
lar art program for children,”
said Garner, a French and Stu-
dio Art major who will be teach-
ing in the Nancy-Metz region of
Northern France.

She heard about the scholar-
ship through Dean George Bent,
who was her art history profes-
sor at the time.

Bent encouraged her to ap-
ply because of her love for the
French language, for art and her

All recipients of the Ful-
bright use the money to cover
living and study expenses for a
year while furthering their own
personal research goals.

The money received is usu-
ally enough to cover all expens-
es.

Strother will be using her
Spanish major as a Fulbright
Teaching Assistant just outside
of Madrid in the city of Al-
corcon for at least 16 hours per
week.

She would also like to take
classes at a local university and
further her interest in Spanish
theater.

“I am interested in the idea of
using theater as a teaching tool,”
said Strother.

She became especially in-
terested in Spanish theater after
reading Lope de Vega’s “F uente
Ovejuna” when she studied
abroad in Seville, Spain last
year.

“Performances of plays
such as this one not only give
student audiences exposure to

“I can ’t wait to be in Spain
and have the opportunity to
pour my love for the language
and for teaching into a class-

room full of Spanish students. ”

MEG STROTHER, Class of 2006

into history, but also pull to the
surface important issues from a
seemingly archaic work,” said
Strother about the play, written
during the Spanish Golden Age.

Despite the challenge that
living and working in another
country will pose, both Strother
and Garner are excited about
the possibilities for research and
getting to know another culture.

“It’s such an eye—opening ex-
perience,” said Strother. “I can’t
wait to be in Spain and have the
opportunity to pour my love for
the language and for teaching
into a classroom full of Spanish
students 

Strother is hoping that her
time in Spain will help her dis-
cover what she wants to do for
her future.

She wants to ﬁnd a way to
combine her love for the Span-
ish language and her love for
people into a career.

Garner plans on attending
graduate school for counseling
at the Peabody College of Van-
derbilt University in the fall of
2007.

She hopes to combine her
interest in art with her love for
working with children to devel-
op her own art therapy counsel-
ing practice.

Hibbard and Greiner will
also be teaching the English
language overseas and Greiner
will be combining her teaching
with research on the French En-
lightenment.

after, the Eagles wrapped up the championship with wins
over Tabb (6-1, 6-3) and sophomore Kelly Will (6-1, 6-2),
ending the tournament 5-1. Last year, the Generals lost to
Emory in the ﬁnals 5-3.
