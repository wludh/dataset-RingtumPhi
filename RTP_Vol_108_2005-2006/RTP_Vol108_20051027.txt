Mayock, Contact go three rounds in debate over speakers, student funds and political agenda

By Marshall Rule
REPORTER

Contact Committee’s Vice-
Chair for Finance, David
Kronenfeld, is frustrated with the
Celebrating Women Cormnittee.

According to Kronenfeld, Con-
tact was asked to provide a
speaker for the Celebrating
Women keynote speaker.

But Kronenfeld’s frustration
comes from the mandates that
were requested by Dean Mayock,
Chair of Planning for the Celebrat-
ing Women Committee.

Kronenfeld was asked to
choose a keynote speaker who is

politically liberal.

“Dean Mayock said that the
speaker must come from the left,
and that anything else would be a
Republican woman’s mouth
speaking men’s ideas.

“I was so surprised to hear
something like that from her, he
said.”

In a personal interview this
Tuesday, Dean Mayock explained
her reasoning.

‘‘I wouldn’t welcome a woman
who has made backwards steps for
women,” Mayock said.

Mayock gave the example of
Laura Bush ‘as someone who
might fit that category.

When people — be they
prospective students, potential
residents, or tourists — visit
Lexington, everyone in town
loves to talk about how quiet
and safe this small city is.

Recently, however, some
members of the j W&L
community have begun to
question if their collegiate
home is really as safe as
advertised.

A growing string of
disturbing crimes - from armed
trespassers in Davidson Park,
thefts at frat houses, to a
mysterious stalker who has
followed several women home
from the library -— has caused
various campus groups to
evaluate security and safety on
the campus. I

According to Mayock, Laura
Bush is a person who is famous
through her husband, compared to
Hillary Clinton, who has raised
important issues regarding welfare
as a Senator since being First
Lady.

Kronenfeld agrees with
Mayock that no woman should be
brought in who hasn’t accom-
plished things on her own. But
Kronenfeld would like to be able
to choose the speaker based on
merit, rather than political afﬁ1ia-
tion. '

He would have liked to get
Peggy Noonan, but Kronenfeld
says Mayock did not respond well

to the idea.

Kronenfeld said, “I am more
than happy to provide a speaker
for the Celebrating Women Com-
mittee.

“I just don’t think that we
should be asked to provide a
speaker whose views don’t reﬂect
the student body’s.”

Ultimately the choice was up
to Contact Committee, who has
decided to bring in Barbara
Ehrenreich to speak.

Ehrenreich is a political essay-
ist and social critic who is in-
volved in a broad range of social
issues. Her recent book, Nickle
and Dimed, described her attempt

to live on low—wage jobs sold over
a million copies.

Both Mayock and Kronenfeld
are satisfied with the choice of
speaker.

Kronenfeld is just not happy
with the administration pressuring
Contact to use student funds in a
certain way.

“There are two major issues
here,” Kronenfeld said.

“The first is the
administration’s desire to use stu-
dentfunds. The second is that we
were given a political mandate by
the administration to pick a
speaker of a certain political per-
suasion.”

Minority report

Admissions seeks new ingredients for the salad bowl

By Sarah Kientz
REPORTER

While the admissions depart-
ment looks at all aspects of an pro-
spective student’s application, mi-
nority status is often a large fac-
tor.

Though many believe that mi-
nority students are favored in the
admissions process, the admis-
sions department is only striving
to expose minority students to
W&L in order to diversify our
campus, Admissions Counselor
Charlie Boisky said.

Boisky said the admissions de-
partment looks for “high-achiev-
ing students” with good statistics
such as a class rank in the top 10%
of their classes, outstanding SAT
and ACT scores, but also students
who are “big ﬁsh in a small pond-
type kids.”

“We like to see students with
lots of leadership experience who
are very passionate about some-
thing, whatever it is, that will con-
tribute to the W&L environment,”
Boisky said.

He added that ethnic diversity
is also important in contributing
to the “W&L environment.” _

“In class it’s not so much the
person standing in front of you,
it’s the person next to you that you
learn from,” Boisky said. He
added that when he was a student
at W&L, his classmates believed
W&L students were “living in a
bubble.”

“We want the student body to
be more reflective of the world
outside this campus,” Boisky said.

So are minority students fa-
vored in the admissions process?
Boisky made it seem like the an-
swer was yes and no.

Boisky said the admissions de-
partment gives minority students
many incentives to visit the carn-
pus and to apply.

For example, the admissions
department offers overnight cam-
pus visits for any ethnic minority,
in which they will pay for the
student’s airfare or other means of
travel if necessary.

In addition, the Heinz Schol-
arship is a large draw for minority
students, Erin Hutchinson, Assis-
tant Director of Admissions and
Coordinator of Minority" Recruit-
ment, said.

The scholarship, established by
the H.J. Heinz Company Founda-
tion, provides for all academic and
living expenses for four years.

Scholarship winners are given
paid internships with the H].

  

Heinz company each summer,
with a strong possibility of em-
ployment with Heinz once stu-
dents have graduated from W&L.

Three to five Heinz scholar-
ships are awarded each year.

Hutchinson said that Heinz and
W&L work together through the
scholarship in order to increase
diversity both in the company and
on campus.

“The scholarship is aimed at
students with disadvantaged back-
grounds, which is typically minor-
ity students,” Hutchinson said.

Through campus visits and the
Heinz scholarship, Hutchinson
said the admissions department is
attempting to draw minority stu-
dents to consider W&L.

“A lot of minority students, for

example, Arrrcan American stu-
dents, rnight be turned off by a
school named after Robert E.
Lee,” Hutchinson said. “Most stu-
dents who come to visit fall in love
with the place, but we need to ex-
pose them first and make them see
that we are not still ﬁghting the
civil war.”

Although minority students
may receive some advantages
while visiting campus, everyone
is on equal ground when it comes
to applying to W&L.

Each application is looked at
individually, and no students are
accepted based on ethnicity,
Boisky said, adding that“minority
students are every bit as qualified
as everyone else.”

Hutchinson said that minority
status often comes into play when
the department is “separating
equals,” or making decisions be-
tween two students who are
equally as qualiﬁed.

“We want a well—rounded class
with people from different areas,
backgrounds, and experiences,”
Hutchinson said.

“Anybody that has something
that we’re lacking has an advan-
tage,” she said, adding that this
“something” could be anything
from ethnicity and socio-eco-
nomic status to a unique passion
or activity.

Hutchinson said the freshman
class has 49 students of American
Ethnic/Racial Minorities, making
up 10% of the class: 20 African-
American, 1 Native American, 16
Asian American, 6 Hispanic and
6 Multicultural or other ethnic
group.

Overall, Hutchinson added that
the most important aspect in the
admissions department is to select
students they feel will be comfort-
able and contribute to W&L.

“We’re not trying to bring any-
body here who’s not going to suc-
ceed or enjoy their time,”
Hutchinson said. “Over-night vis-
its are to expose students to the
campus, not to force people here.”

Freshman Shreya Durvasula, a
student of Indian decent, found
out about W&L through her high
school college counselor and was
not given any beneﬁts while vis-
iting campus.

Although she does not see
W&L as a diverse campus, she
saw life here as a unique opportu-
nity.

“I wasn’t going to go here be-
cause there was such a lack of di-
versity, but I saw it as a chance to
teach others about my culture,”
Durvasula said. “It was an oppor-
tunity for me to take a chance and
be tolerant, too.”

David Leonard, the Dean of
Freshmen, said it is important to
focus on diversity in order to pre-
pare for life after college.

“Increased ethnic diversity in
the United States is an important
reality that governments, commu-
nities, organizations, companies
and college campuses are facing,”

‘Leonard said.

“I strongly believe that a
diverse student body, faculty and
staff at W&L will greatly enhance
teaching and learning both in and
beyond the classroom and prepare
our students for life beyond Wash-
ington and Lee.”

BEHIND
BARS

Here’s to laughing at the expense of
those who learned their lessons this
weekend. Reporter Jacob Geiger took
a peek at this week’s police reports to
see what you ’ve been up to...don’t

worry, we only used your initials!

Minors offending

DC, a junior resident of one
of Tucker Street’s favorite
houses, was ticketed last
Monday at 1:40 AM for un-
derage possession of alcohol.
Three 19-year-olds from
Oklahoma, none of whom at-
tend W&L, were ticketed at
the same time. No word on
whether these fine chaps
were some of the Sigma Nu
pledges visiting from Okla-
homa State. Wherever
they’re from, the three left
Lexington with a souvenir of
their visit.

What LIFE posters are
made of

EB and AB, two fun-loving
freshmen from the BDG
Quad, found out that Nelson
St. can be quite perilous at
4:23 AM. Though EB
doesn’t remember what hap-
pened and AB says “if you
don’t remember what ‘hap-
pened I’m not going to tell
you,” the police apparently
do know what happened.
Stumble around drunk at
4:15 and you’re liable to
“wake up in a room with no
windows and a locked door,”
as EB so eloquently put it.
Punishment (after making a
deal with the prosecutor): 7
months probation. Ifthe -
probation is broken, a $2500
fine and up to a year in jail
could result.

Safety becomes

the numbers.

“Part of the reason the ’04
numbers were up is that we had a
string of burglaries and larcenies
in the downtown business district
last summer, and that drove things
up.

“We made an arrest eventually
and broke up the ring,” he said.

When asked about the recent
run of crimes around W&L, Beard
responded that he “hopes these
recent events are just an isolated
spike in crime. Hopefully it’s not
a sign of a long term trend.

“We’d like to get some leads
in those fraternity crimes [thefts
from the Phi Psi Fraternity House,
7 Tucker, a PIKA off-campus
house, and other residences over
Homecoming Weekend], but
larceny and vandalism are two of
the hardest crimes to solve unless
we can catch someone in the act
or find a witness who is 100% sure
they know who did it.”

Hot Springs

thejefferson@tds.net

Michael Young, W&L’s
Director of Campus Security,
agreed with Chief Beard’s
analysis. <

“I’m absolutely convinced,” he
reported, “that these aren’t
evidence of some larger trend.

“In fact, I think the pictures that
were taken from the frat houses
were probably stolen by a frat
that’s not here at W&L. Really,
when you think about it, fraternity
composites, paintings of Lee, and
pictures of the Colonnade would
be trophies for a frat at some other
school.”

Perhaps most disturbing of all
is the still anonymous man who
has, on at least four instances,
followed a female student out of
the library and back to either the
residence halls or sorority houses.

On at least two occasions the
man asked the woman out on a
date, even though neither woman
had met him before.

None of the women involved

6118 Sam Snead ‘Highway

wanted to speak on the record to
the Phi, but several of the girls
have told their friends about
seeing the man around campus.

While Young reported that the
security office had been contacted
about the stalker, he expressed
frustration with the students’
failure to promptly inform his staff
about the problem.

While W&L students are all
busy thinking about their own
safety, local residents must also
consider crimes committed by
these students.

The FBI’s 2003 report
documented 72 cases of drunk
driving and another 74 cases of
public drunkenness.

Toss in the 28 liquor law
violations and 25 drug crimes and
you discover that 60% of the 330
tickets issued by the Lexington
Police Department were related to
either drugs or alcohol.

Though the Phi was unable to
determine exactly how many of

Unclean getaway

Too tired to clean up the de-
bris from your latest party be-
fore passing out? You may
want to reconsider that deci-
sion. Lex Po cracked down
this month on littering, issu-
ing tickets to CW and CQ in
separate incidents. Both tick-
ets were issued on a Sunday
morning for “litter on prop-
erty.” CW’s ticket was issued
at the un-holy hour of 8:43
AM, long before most rea-
sonable students would even
consider climbing out of bed
to pick up plastic cups. Be-
sides, isn’t that what pledges
are for?

Laws of physics

This week’s list includes a
W&L male who was pulled
over while sober driving.
The police clocked him at 40
mph in a 25 zone. When
asked in court why he was
driving so fast, the driver re-
plied, “Well, I didn’t even
have my foot on the accelera-
tor, I think. I guess the car’s
momentum was just too
strong and I let it get away
from me. I was just trying to
do what was right and get ev-
eryone back.” Though the
judge didn’t seem to buy the
whole “momentum theory,”
the driver got off with just 10
hours of community service
and a driver improvement
course.

issue

these crimes were committed by
W&L students, a cursory glance
at the police station’s docking
book indicates that W&L students
are responsible for a signiﬁcant
portion of all arrests and an even
larger proportion of arrests for
public drunkenness.

The 238 crimes mentioned
earlier reﬂect the number of actual
guilty convictions, not number of
tickets issued.

“We’ve had one call about it,
he said, “and even then the person
waited until a week after the
incident before calling us.

“So if this has happened more
than once, nobody’s called us to
tell us about it.

“If somebody sees that guy
they need to report him as soon as
possible; by acting quickly we can
try to get the guy before he leaves
campus.

“We can’t do much without a
timely call from the student who’s
being followed.”

Stepping it up an octave

After years of mediocrity, campus choral groups stage acomeback

By Jessica Shaw
STAFF WRITER

It was difficult to ﬁnd a seat
on the balcony of the Lexington
Presbyterian Church last week as
students, professors and commu-
nity members packed in to listen
to the music performed by W&L
choral groups. These talented vo-
calists took the stage for over an
hour captivating" their audience
with a wide variety of music.

The University Chamber Sing-
ers started the night off with four
beautiful pieces ranging from Ubi
Caritas et Amor to a tango selec-

tion.

They plan to perform similar
tango pieces when they travel to
Argentina over spring break.

“I feel like we needed just a
little more time to tweak some
things, and our Parents’ Weekend
concert will be a lot better,”
sophomore alto Emma Axt said.

“We had a lot of songs and not
very much time to learn them.
Now that we have performed, we
can identify the rough spots and
work on them.”

This prestigious group is led by
Professor Gordon Spice who has
directed choral activities since
1973.

He’s very open-minded if we
have any suggestions about any of

the pieces,” Axt said. “He’s very
good at what he does; he can be
low key and still take it seriously
and be a very good leader.”

General Admission, JubiLee,
and Southern Comfort Singers
then stunned spectators with con-
temporary selections like Break-
fast at Tiffany’s clad in bright col-
ors and decorative accessories.

Solos were performed by fresh-
man Wes Haydon and juniors Sam
Wilmoth and Taylor Walle .

The 65-member University
Chorus then charmed the crowd
with their ‘Season of the Classics’
theme incorporating Hadyn,
Mozart and Brahms. Chorus Di-
rector Jerry Myers is in his seventh

year at W&L. With his arrival, he
has shaped the choir from a stu-
dent activity into a prestigious vo-
cal unit.

“In my ﬁrst couple of years, it
was hard not being able to do
music beyond a high school
level,” Myers said. “Now with au-
ditions, we started to build the
choir back up. Then, we were able
to do more challenging music.
More challenging music is Very
rewarding.”

The chorus meets on Mondays
and Wednesdays from 4:30-6pm.
They perform four concerts each
year, this one being their first. For
the fall concert, the chorus gath-
ered for a mere 10 rehearsals. Pro-

fessor Myers said the first re-
hearsal is always the most fun for
him. i
“I don’t know the group; that’s
when I really get to play,” he said.
“[1 get to] see what they can do;
see what they’re capable of; see
what I can expect. This yearl can
expect a lot.”

Despite the rigorous practice
schedule, students only earn one
credit for University Chorus.

“I want it to be fun; something
they can do on top of an academic
schedule,” Myers said.

With new auditions and strate-
gies to focus on each singer’s
voice, students say Myers has
made a huge impact on the pro-
gram.

“It’s deﬁnitely made me a bet-
ter musician,” senior Kristine

Holda said. “I played an instru-
ment in high school, and I new
music some, but the voice takes
so much more control. You’re
more self-aware than you are with
an instrument.”

Myers said he enjoys being ac-
cessible to his students. He wants
them to feel they can approach
him with anything from their dif-
ﬁculty with classes to their life
issues.

“He’s so committed to what he
does,” Holda said. “I’ve heard
him make someone who couldn’t
carry a tune sing. He’s a great
teacher. The choir is Jeny Myers.”

The choir will be performing
in Lee Chapel this Friday for Par-
ents Weekend from 8-9pm. There
will also be an A Capella concert
on Saturday from 6-8pm.

Not your typical love story

Controversial and profound, The Shape of Things provokes students to question and evaluate their beliefs

By Nadja Wolfe

STAFF WRITER

“I don’t believe in good and
bad people,” said playwright
Neil LaBute Friday at an open
Q&A. “I believe in people who
do good and bad things.” The
Shape of Things, playing
through Monday at the Johnson
Theatre in the Lenfest Center,
challenges audiences to see be-
yond the characters to why and
what they believe.

Evelyn (sophomore Paten
Hughes) and Adam (junior
Charles Barbour), sans garden,
meet at the museum where he
works—and she’s planning to
deface a statue.

She’s a self-conﬁdent and de-
termined grad student, he’s a shy
and homely indebted undergrad,
and the audience is ready for a
typical girl-tums—guy-into—a-stud
happily ever after story includ-
ing some soaps-worthy drama.

But LaBute’s play doesn’t
traverse along to a fairytale end-
ing, instead exploring the nature
of art within a highly controver-
sial framework.

At Evelyn’s encouragement
and manipulation, Adam begins
to change. He exercises and eats
healthily, although he says he
hates it, replaces his unfashion—
able glasses with contacts, even
gives away a jacket he’s worn
every day for years.

His engaged friends Phillip (
Joshua Nettinga ‘O7L) and Jenny
( sophomore Lisa Reppell) note

the changes with approval—and
Evelyn with distrust and confu-
sion.

The cast performed marvel-
ously in challenging roles.
Hughes’ Evelyn was remark-
able, showing the audience what
she thinks with when her actions
could potentially be very dis-
tracting.

tures the character so well one
isn’t sure he doesn’t actually ex-
ist. Nettinga gives a strong per-
formance as Phillip down to
great body language. And
Reppell is completely believable
as the almost too sweet, lonely
Jenny somewhat overpowered
by Phi1lip’s personality.

ing out the full dimensionality
of the characters, and organizes
their interactions on stage very
naturally.

The set, designed by W&L
Theater professor Owen Collins
and technical director Tom
Anderson, is amazing in its ver-
satility and function, serving
as a museum, an apartment, a
bedroom, a playground (with

swings), and a display of all
Evelyn’s art. Changes of scene
are covered by edgy music and
sound design by alum Josh
Harvey and Jennifer Anderson,
Lenfest technical director, and
include original compositions by
Harvey.

The music complements the
costume designs of T. Anderson,
of which particularly Evelyn’s

wonderfully highlights her char-
acter.

The Shape of Things pro-
vokes audiences to see beyond
the surface of people, art, soci-
ety, and the play, which can it-
self be understood on several
levels.

Audiences will likely find
Evelyn’s actions reprehensible
at the least; however, they
should appreciate her message,
and see how what society does
regularly is no different or bet-
ter than her project. .

Art is controversial and com-
plex, as LaBute shows through
the feelings he evokes in the au-
dience and writes in his charac-
ters.

When the play is done, one
must wonder at which is worse,
“sculpting” another human be-
ing through manipulation, or
changing oneself solely because
of what another person says or
thinks.

This different view of moral-
ity and art causes the audience
to reevaluate what they think and
believe. But whatever result,
indifference, the cardinal sin of
the play, will not be the result.

“Difference is good. . .Only
indifference is suspect,” says
Evelyn, recalling words of
LaBute from Friday afternoon:
the beauty of art is that people
can look at the exact same thing
and have completely different
opinions. The Shape of Things
is a play well—made in every as-
pect that shouldn’t be missed.

ey are more like my broth-
. l and sisters,” she said about
hercousiiis. Having a close fam-
urged Futrell on to a career
ere she could be immersed
h the company of others.
Futrell attended Virginia
mmonwealth University as an
iergraduate, intending to be-
ne Dr. Futrell, M.D., before
' school years were through.
“Then, I was introduced to
emistry,” she said as she
ised to laugh. “I decided [the
:dica1 profession] was prob-
.y not my calling.”
Futrell chose instead to ma-
in psychology.
In graduate school at
ngwood College (now Uni-
rsity) in Farmville, Va, she
)se a concentration of Com-

 

“I am hard on students
because I have high
expectations of them.

I see potential in them.”

TAMARA FUTRELL, Asslstant Dean ofstudonu and Mul1icu|!uralAﬂa|m

munity and College Counseling
to go with her Masters of Science
in Education.

The concentration got her
ready to counsel college kids —
which is a skill that Washington
and Lee students are glad she
has.

After graduation, she headed
to Hollins University to the Of-
fice of Housing and Residence
Life.

Before long, Futrell was,

working directly with students in
the Office of First Year — the
equivalent of our Dean Leonard.
Soon, the university had added
a Sophomore Programs to the
ofﬁce.

“We realized that the students
leaving our institution were do-
ing so at the beginning or at the
end of their sophomore year,”
said Futrell.

Administrators began to give

the same amount of attention to

the sophomores as they were giv-
ing the freshman. This was an
easy task, as all four class years
at Hollins have to live on cam-
pus.

“It was very easy to organize
things in the residence halls,”
said Futrell.

How did Washington and Lee
find her? Well, said Futrell, she

kind of found W&L.

“I met Dawn Watkins two
years prior to coming to Wash-
ington and Lee,” she said.

She worked with Watkins at
conferences and programs, and
they worked together very well.

Visiting W&L and Watkins,
Futrell once met her predecessor.
After being introduced to him,
she announced “I want your job.”

When he left, she applied for
the position.

Futrell is excited to be work-
ing with her friend, Watkins.

“She’s brilliant and such a for-

ward-thinker. She’s really pro-

gressive.”l

Futrell serves as the Assistant
Dean of Students and
Multicultural Affairs. Various
jobs fall to her, including advis-
ing and working with various
multicultural student organiza-
tions, something she has a pas-
sion for.

Futrell serves as the faculty
advisor to eight different orga-
nizations, including MSA and
Joyful Noise.

In addition, she often works
with ﬁve other organizations that
fall under the multicultural
office, including GSA and
PAACE.

“My role as faculty advisor

differs with every organization,”
Futrell said. “It depends on who
the executive counsel is and what
role they want me to play.”

Futrell makes sure to use the
term “multicultural” instead of
the more commonly used term
“minority.”

“There are so many negative
connotations" of the word,
Futrell said. “It has a sense of
superiority and inferiority in it.”

Futrell uses “multicultural”
because “it emphasizes the fact
that this person is different — in
a good way. ”

She also assists in training the

Residence Life Staff, something A

she has been doing since her
Hollins days.

Washington and Lee’s phi-
losophy to training, said Futrell,
is to“help students be good men-
tors to other students.”

In all the ways Futrell works
with students, there is one thing
that remains the same.

“She’s blatantly honest with
you,” admits E’Lon Cohen, ’07,
something she thinks is the rea-
son that Futrell is well—liked and
a trusted mentor among students.

Futrell agrees. “I am hard on
students because I have high ex-
pectations of them,” she said
simply. “I see potential in them.”

The times are a-changin’... and so should the trend for male Presidents

By Ashley Brightwell
COLU MNIST

As Washington and Lee cel-
ebrates the twenty-ﬁrth anniver-
sary of the presence of women
at the University this year, it’s
hard to comprehend how
women can be kept from posi-
tions of power within the Uni-
versity itself.

In spite of equally qualiﬁed
women applying for higher po-
sitions, the jobs of President,
Provost and deans more often
go to men.

In fact, in the over 250 years
since this school was estab-
lished, there have only been a

handful of female deans, such as
Dawn Watkins, the current Dean
of Students.

The University needs to under-
stand that without varying per-
spectives, we can only exist in a
state of stagnation. The integra-
tion of new viewpoints into posi-
tions of power is vital for growth
and change.

After over 250 years of male
Presidents at Washington and
Lee, isn’t it about time we had
some change?

There is nothing about women
that make them any less capable
of performing the job of President
of the University than men, and
in fact, the change from a male to

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

female President might actually
help the University to modem-
ize and move past certain out-
dated patriarchal values and tra-
ditions that have dictated the
way of life at our University
since the eighteenth century.

When the school became co-
ed, the core value of the school,
“be a gentleman”, simply be-
came “be a gentleman (or
gentlewoman)” and it often feels
as though the rules of conduct
are thus geared toward men,
with women just tacked on and
not really considered.

After all, it seems a little
sketchy that while cheating is

considered an honor violation,

rape is not.

A female president would be
able to work toward changing the
values of the University to really
include women.

It is high time that Washing-
ton and Lee embraced the twenty-
ﬁrst century view of equality and
allowed a woman into a position
of power that has so long been a
male-occupied role.

The presence of a woman as
president of the University is cru-
cial to ﬁnally completing the in-
tegration of women into Washing-
ton and Lee.

After all, this is a time to cel-
ebrate the presence of women in
the University, isn’t it?

Little White book

Honor violations not defined in book--and that’s how it should be,al|eges reader

To the Editor:

I must respectfully disagree
with Caley Anderson’s conclusion
that the Honor System needs to be
reevaluated (Ring-tum Phi, Octo-
ber 10, 2005). Mr. Anderson and I
have both worked at the sharp edge
of the Honor System as Honor
Advocates, but I cannot agree with
his arguments.

Mr. Anderson begins by saying
that the White Book speciﬁcally
outlines lying, cheating and steal-
ing as clear Honor Violations.

The relevant text reads, “Al-
though dishonorable conduct can-
not be codified, lying, cheating‘
and stealing are clear examples of
breaches of the Honor System.”
This would be troublesome on its
own, but in the context of the Phi-
losophy section of the White
Book, the passage ﬁts nicely, es-
pecially with its preceding sen-
tence: “The Honor System con-

I demns only acts that the current

student generation views as
breaches of the community’s
trust.” Taken alone, Mr.
Anderson’s example is problem-
atic. Read in context, however, it
fulﬁlls its purpose, advising read-

-ers that students alone determine

what constitutes dishonorable be-

havior.

My critics will argue that the
mere act‘ of offering examples of
possible honor violations consti-
tutes a codiﬁcation of honor, but
I ﬁrmly believe that students need
some sort of example in order to
understand Honor Violations. Mr.
Anderson’s hypothetical of lying
to an arsonist to protect the C-
School nicely illustrates a case that
no EC would prosecute, but with-
out the current text, how are we
to explain our Honor System to
freshmen each year? Arriving at
W&L is chaotic enough, and
freshmen especially need some
sort of guideline to understand
dishonorable behavior. Without
those words, EC members would
be faced with telling incoming
freshmen every year simply that
they know dishonorable behavior
when they see it. If that standard

and Lee University,

missed” notation is a powerful
disincentive for students to appeal
to an Open Hearing. That much is
true, but Mr. Anderson ignores the
reasoning for that disincentive at
his peril.

At an Open Hearing, the EC
itself is tried along with the ac-
cused student. The EC must
present its case and its reasoning,
while the accused student must
convince the jury that the EC is
mistaken.

An honorable student, wrong-
fully convicted by the EC, will
have no problem proving such a
case. The disincentive is to pre-
vent every single Closed Hearing
giving way to an Open Hearing
because the Honor System trusts
the EC to know their fellow stu-
dents and to judge accordingly.

An Open Hearing after every
case would betray that trust, and
students would eventually grow
tired of seeing every case re—ar-
gued in Lee Chapel, to the detri-
ment of any legitimate appeals that
might come before a student jury.
The Open Hearing is there as a ﬁ-
nal appeal for those students who
are wrongfully convicted by the
EC, not as yet another burden for
convicted students to undertake
before withdrawing.

Fundamentally, we must trust
the EC to carry out its duties. I
have known and worked with EC
President Charlie Yates since his
freshman year, and I have com-
plete conﬁdence in the Commit-
tee and him to weigh each case
carefully and in accordance with
the students’ conception of honor.
Students elect the EC speciﬁcally

because the student body as a
whole cannot oversee every single
case. Their input into the Honor
System consists of electing those
representatives, and though can-
didates do not run on platforms
outlining to their conceptions of
honor, those elected are trusted by
their peers. If any student does not
share my conﬁdence in the Com-
mittee, I ask him or her: did you
run for ofﬁce, or take an active
role in encouraging someone you
trust to do so?

If not, reconsider your doubts.
I lost the EC President election
during the winter of my junior year
by a wide margin, and while my
pride suffered somewhat, I contin-
ued defending accused students to
the best of my ability. I am pleased
to call that my contribution to the
Honor System. What is yours?

I commend Mr. Anderson and
the Ring-tum Phi for his article,
and W&L students would do well
to heed his call to take an active
interest in the Honor System. It
has become fashionable to criti-
cize the EC and the Honor Sys-
tem over the past few years, espe-
cially since the infamous Gabe
Katz case, but I urge students to
consider that the Honor System
and its institutions are in place for
a reason. They may not be perfect,
but they are the culmination of
more than one hundred years of
trial and error at enforcing honor-
able behavior, and the student
body would do well to remember
that before changing them.

Media not doing candidates justice in looking at wrong credentials

By Justin McKeen
COLUMNIST

A month ago I bet there
weren’t 200 people on this cam-
pus who could have told you who
Harriet Miers was. Now she’s a
nominee for one of the most
prestigious appointments our
nation can bestow. A lot more
people know her name now, but
is that enough?

Appointments to the Supreme
Court are always a matter for
deep discussion. After all, those
justices are the people who have
the final say over the constitu-
tionality of legislation. Not only
that, they’re justices for life, sub-
ject to good behavior. Can any-
one picture, let alone remember,
a supreme court justice involved
in a maj-or scandal? A few have
been caught during their conﬁr-
mation, which only goes to show
why that process is so important.

The last few months have
brought two successive appoint-
ments to the Supreme Court,

which is two more than I’ve ever
paid attention to before. What’s
struck me throughout both pro-
cesses has not been the intensive
questioning of the candidates,
not the journalistic search to pro-
vide insight into the norninee’s
character and abilities, but rather
the amazing ability of Washing-
ton and the media to focus on
exactly the wrong things.
Harriet Miers is vanilla. This
woman must be the utility in-
fielder on the firm’s softball
team. Honestly, I know George
Bush likes her, I know she passed
the bar, and that’s about it. Most
people reading this are now ex-
pecting the usual plea for more
information, and you’d be right,
that’s exactly what I want, but not

I because I want to endorse or re-

ject her candidacy. Instead, I
want to know that whoever is sit-
ting on the highest court in the
land is a judge. I don’t need a
dispassionate observer. I want
someone who is intelligent
enough to hold opinions, analyze
the law, and make an argument.
If Harriet Miers gets her seat and
casts the deciding vote to repeal
Roe v. Wade, l’1l be happy. Not
because I want Roe v. Wade re-
pealed but because at least I’ll
know that someone was thinking
about the issue and making a
study of the Constitution. That’s
their job after all. We have to
trust that the Court, and that trust
derives itself from the people
that make it up.

At least I ’ll know that someone was thinking

about the issue and making a study of the

Constitution. That’s their job, after all.

 

The Republican party is in
power right now. They hold the
presidency, they hold congress,
and, whatever democrats may
claim, I’d say that’s a pretty clear
sign that they have the mandate
of the people. How long that may
last is another question, but why,
if they now have that mandate,
shouldn’t George Bush appoint
a conservative judge?

I’m not a Republican. I’m not
even a Democrat. But stripping
all the party politics out of it, I
want someone on the Supreme
Court who is qualiﬁed to inter-
pret the law. Their politics should

' be looked at, but political inﬁght-
ing shouldn’t reduce us to the *

point that we’re searching out
longtime pool-boys for the Court
because they’re nice people and
have no paper trail. Whatever
happens with Miers, I hope the
next appointee to the Court is
smart, opinionated, and last and
deﬁnitely least, shares my politi-
cal views.

School intimidates minorities

Lack of minorities symptomatic of larger problem: students’ need to diversify rather than unity

By Mallory Ruymann
CO LU MN I ST

Everyone at Washington and
Lee agrees that there are not many
problems with the school; the
grounds are meticulously main-
tained, it’s one of the best educa-
tions in the country, and social life
is fabulous.

However if you look around,
more often than not, all you will
see is white faces. Although the
school has done a good job of in-
jecting some ‘ﬂavor’ into the cam-
pus in recent years, W&L is still
considered one of the least-diverse
schools in the nation.

Why is this so? Does our repu-
tation precede us, or are we not
actively recruiting a large number
of minorities?

Many minorities are intimi-
dated to come to a school where
there is not a large base of minor-
ity students.

Without a large support-sys-
tem, many feel a heightened
awareness of their differences due
to the largely white population,
and are also generally singled out
for being a minority; be it in the
classroom, student organizations,
or the admissions process

The admissions process here at
W&L, as I understand it, does take

into account the race/ethnicity of
a prospective, but only in the cat-
egory of differences of life expe-
rience. ’ ‘ '

This policy results in the ad-
mittance of minorities who are
just as qualiﬁed as any other per-
son to be here.

However, the amount of mi-
nority students admitted is obvi-
ously not a large number. This
may be due to the fact that not
many apply; however, the num-
bers speak for themselves and
should not be as low as they are.

In order to increase the num-
ber of minority students on cam-
pus, we must start with transform-

ing the stereotype of a W&L stu-
dent. W&L must demonstrate to
the world that not every single stu-
dent who goes here is whitei and
all students need to commit to tol-
erating and befriending different
types of people.

Who each of us is will never
change, nor can anyone look past
it; however, we must all embrace
each other for our individual
uniqueness. Once we start actively
altering our attitudes towards
eachother to create a more wel-
coming environment, minority
prospectives will take notice and
hopefully W&L will be ﬁlled with
many different ﬂavors.

You should be, too.

Weather or no

There is only one explanation for Mother Nature’s moodiness:

By Hugh Trout
COLUMNIST

Man, Mother Nature rolls
harder than Suge Knight these
days.

These hurricanes are becom-
ing as frustratingly repetitious as
a Gwen Stefani song. Between
Lexington ﬂuctuating by 40 de-
grees everyday and some states
wondering if they are going to
exist this time next week, Mother
Nature is trying to tell us some-
thing, and I think it is high time
we start to ﬁgure out what the
hell that something is.

I know what all of you are
thinking: Hugh, its plain to see
that Mother Nature just doesn’t
like this whole Ashlee Simpson
comeback and is venting her
frustration. Good point reader
and I agree that even though it is
by far the most obvious reason,
it is also the most probable.

Lets face it, Ashlee Simpson
i_sn’t talented and should leave
the singing to her more talented
sister (same thing goes for
Hillary Duff’s sister: I don’t
know who you are, but please get
out of the way so your talented
sister can entertain me).

But here at the Phi we don’t
just speculate and barely scratch
the surface, not at all. What we
do is speculate, barely scratch the
surface and are inﬂammatory
enough to incite some reader to
write an equally over-the-top re-
sponse to something all other
readers forgot about ﬁve minutes

Anatomy of the frat hat

With all the effort to dress just right, why is the filthy hat such a fashion necessity?

By Tim Livingston
COLUMNIST

I dwell on one mystery for at
least fifteen minutes a day. What
is the fascination with dirty hats?

Men at our fine institution
thoroughly enjoy telling the
W&L community they are mem-
bers of a prestigious fraternity
through their apparel. I have no
problem with this aspect of our
school.

However, I am perplexed why
ﬁlthy hats ﬁt into a style that in-
cludes ridiculously over—priced
shirts, pants, and shoes.

The first thing you learn when
you join many fraternities is how
to dress.

There is a ﬁve hour class that

several frat’s make their pledges .

sit through in order to learn the
subtle intricacies of dressing like
a proper W&L Fratty McFrat
boy.

Sadly, I’m sure that half of the
people who read that last sen-
tence instantly believed that
there is a class that perpetuates
the homogeneity at our school.

There is not, but the point is
that if there was one, there would
be a weighty portion devoted to
how to wear your ﬁlthy ‘hats.

The first step involves buying
a $15 college hat (South Caro-
lina, Vanderbilt, Alabama are
popular) and then tying that cap
to a wooden stick (about 8-9
feet) and then driving through a
dirt ﬁeld while dragging the hat
along.

after they read it.

So, in keeping with that tra-
dition let me list a few of my
theories as to what is up with the
weather. And remember, this is
not something you should actu-
ally take seriously (sort of like
how everyone treats the speak-
ing tradition) and if you find
yourself getting frustrated just
picture watching someone walk
into a glass door and them try-
ing to find a way to make it look
not awkwardly hilarious.

If you are still angry after that,
you are living your life in a joy-
less manner that will only lead
to high blood pressure and thin-
ning hair and for that I apologize
and suggest that maybe you
should have gone to Davidson.

While Burger King is rocking
our socks off with their King
commercials that convey an
overwhelming sense of awk-
wardness but also reassurance
and comfort, McDonald’s is do-
ing a very poor job of compet-
ing. “I’mlovin’ it?”

Well, Mother Nature is not.
What McDonald’s needs to do is
make fast food sexy again. The
Paris Hilton commercials were
good so McDonald’s needs to
show Hardies how they rock it:
Jessica Alba, anyone? Damn I’m
good. Or if not sexy, dangerous.

I know if I saw 50 Cent and
the Harnburglar bust some faces
up and then cruise through the
drive—through to pick up some
McShakes, I would be at
McDonald’s in a heart beat

By the end of this arduous
process, the once pristine item
should obtain a brownish tint that
needs to be mixed with about a
pint of sweat for the concoction
to work and be fratty enough for
daily use.

Obviously wearing a clean hat
is totally out of the question.
When a guy sports his dirty hat
backwards with his conditioned
locks of frat hair oozing out of
the front while representing a
southern school from his home
state...the feeling can only be
described as bliss.

My only dilemma is that I
have neither a southern state to
be a symbol of, nor adequate hair
for the previously illustrated ooz-
ing out effect that is required for
the appropriate look.

Another problem arises when
I realize that I lack the dorky sun-
glasses with the band to keep the
super fratty shades across my
neck at all times. _

Perhaps the absence of these
essentials is why I feel obli-
gated to question the queer-
est style at our school.
When I say queer, I of
course mean odd, and
when I say odd I mean
terrible.

After over a year
at this place I have
found many holes
in our institu-
tion; for
e x -

PMS

showing people that I’m as cool
as they are. Right now, if people
say they are going to the drive
through I’m thinking the idea is
McAwful and walk on over to
Donny T’s.

Or -maybe Mother Nature is
just upset at the new O.C. sea-
son. And not to be a hater, but it
really has gone down hill. They
are already recycling plot lines,
the new characters are as sur-
prising as another allegation of
misconduct against Tom DeLay.

First big let down of the sea-
son: crazy lady is a scam artist
and not an obsessed lesbian. I
’m not very happy about that, and
am seriously consider writing a
stern letter reflecting my frustra-
tion. But then again, Mother Na-
ture seems a lot more pissed off
than I am.

I think another likely possi-
bility is the state of professional
sports.

My guess is Mother Nature
agrees with me on several points:
I have no problem with baseball
players doing all the steroids they
want, I want my NBA players to
wear whatever the hell they want,
and the more players assaulting
drunk fans in the stands the bet-
ter. If T.O. wants to have a ﬁre-
work show in the end zone, bring
it on.

I’m even fine easing rules
against drug use during the play
of the game. You have to admit
it would be pretty sick to watch
Lavar Arrington on speed lay out
some kicker.

ample, the administration refuses
to respect the student body.

However, in spite of these
harrowing aspects of our school,
my main problem remains these
absurd hats.

My first question will be pro-
posed to the select ladies in the
audience who are enthralled by
this primitive form of headwear.

What is intriguing about the
ﬁlth? Do you enjoy rubbing your
hands against the oily hair which
can only accumulate with hours
of pressing against what is in es-
sence dirt? Do you take off your
man’s hat and smell his manly
musk in order to achieve some
type of sensual experience?

Do the women at our school
not understand that they can eas-
ily eradicate something ridicu-
lous like the dirty hats by simply
saying to a man, “Clayton
(or other
8 9 '

 
    
   
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
   
  
 
  
 
 

neric W&L male name), you are
an attractive male without that
stupid hat, and because my hands
are greasier than freshly cooked
bacon after we hook up, I’d ap-
preciate if you stopped the whole
dirty hat thing.”

If one girl speaks these words
to her signiﬁcant other the dirty
hat fad would dissolve faster than
pogs in fifth grade.

I have only one question for
the guys who buy into the ﬁlthy
hat phenomenon. Who was the
genius who thought it would be
cool to ditch clean hats and only
wear dirty ones?

Who woke up in the morning
and said, “I’m sick of wearing all
clean clothing, so I’ll wear all
spotless attire combined with
that old LSU hat I was dragging
on my 9 foot wooden pole
through the dirt ﬁeld yesterday?”
People at this school are
outrageous.
