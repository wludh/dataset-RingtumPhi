Dropped at the door

High percentage of Greek participation increases exclusivity

SORORITY RUSH STATISTICS

By Jessica Shaw
REPORTER

During rush, freshman girls
have 45 minutes to sell their ap-
pearance, charm and personality
to hundreds of upperclass girls.
Enticing videos, ridiculous skits
and inﬁnite sorority songs leave
girls torn between friends, team-
mates and morals.

As each girl makes the long
trek back across the footbridge,
thoughts of insecurity, rejection
and dread overtake them. In a
matter of days, they will ﬁnd out
their future in Greek life, a com-
munity comprised of 76 percent

of women on this campus.

With such a com-

manding presence at

Washington and Lee,

certain expectations
and stereotypes ac-
company this organiza-
tion. This year, only 82
percent of women who
registered ended up
pledging a sorority. The re-
maining women were either
rejected or withdrew.

“I strongly think that Greek
life isn’t for everybody,” said As-
sistant Director of Student Activi-
ties and Greek Life Kristen
Powell. “Our campus Greek life
is extremely inclusive. To have 76
percent participation rate is al-
most unheard of.”

Powell also said that this high
percentage brings with it negative
aspects. Women not affiliated
with a sorority are more likely to
feel out of place.

Several freshman girls were
interviewed for this article. They
all wished to remain anonymous
due to the sensitve nature of pub-
licizing these comments.

“It creates and reinforces the
high school cliques and social
boundaries [that] institutions
such as the speaking tradition are
meant to break down,” a fresh-
man girl said.

Some women said they never
would have considered a soror-
ity at a larger university. Because
of its dominant presence at W&L,
some said it was almost unavoid-
able.

“I hadn’t given rush a lot of

thought before it actually began‘

those first couple of weeks of
winter term,” a freshman girl
said. “But, I thought that since

Greek life was something most
people were involved in, I would
naturally go along with it.”
During rush week, women
visit each of the five sorority
houses. At the end of the night,
women rank them according to

preference, and the sororities do

the same for the women.

“The girls were sweet, and it
was fun to see some people I
don’t get to see very often,” a
freshman girl said. “It is weird to
me, though, that those girls I
talked to at rush had a different
agenda than merely talking to me.

“At that moment, they were
seeing if I fit in; if I was some-
one they wanted.”

In the fall, each freshman hall
was assigned a Rho Gamma.
These girls assisted freshmen
during the recruitment process
and provided emotional support.
Powell also met with freshmen
who needed extra advice.

“One of my roles is to be that
guidance counselor to help them
develop their leadership skills
and personal skills,” she said.

The Rho Gammas stressed

keeping an open mind going into
rush. Powell said the Panhellenic
Council emphasized the fact that
nobody has a normal recruitment
process.

“I think rush puts a lot of pres-
sure on girls, although I don’t
think I would say it is all nega-

' tive,” Rho Gamma Laura Byme

said. “Overall, I think rush is a
great experience for girls to meet
each other, but I definitely see the
pressure building as the week
goes on.”

This aside, many students
found this advice tough.

“While freshmen are encour-
aged not to go in with precon-
ceived ideas about the various so-
rorities, sororities go in with a
clear and distinct idea of what
they want,” a freshman girl said.
“With many of the sororities, this
idea is based on superficial char-
acteristics.” '

Ethnic diversity is also an is-
sue with sororities at W&L.
Powell said she would like to see
a better representation and see
students actively seeking
changes.

“I wish they were a little more
dissatisfied with some things,”
she said. “I think our students

_I accept some things because they

have always been done that way.

There are things our students
need to challenge and improve. I
would love to see our sororities
be morerepresentative of our
campus.”

Though larger universities
may boast a smaller Greek per-
centage, many students feel this
scenario is an even stronger pres-
sure.

This year, just over ten percent
of those registered did not join a
sorority. This number, however,
is relative to a small student
population.

“The exclusivity of it bothers
me,” a freshman girl said.

“I just don’t like that it has the
potential to hurt girls, and it
makes the girls going through
rush think that they have to mea-
sure up to something. Obviously,
I know a bunch of Greek girls,
and they are such great people. I
love the girls, I just don’t like the
system.”

DUIS
on the
decline

 

Drunk driving rates
have gone down among
students at Washington and
Lee, according to the stu-
dent health center’s annual
health survey.

Though an alarming
number of students, 25 per-
cent of those surveyed, re-
ported driving drunk in the
last year, W&L actually has
a student drunk driving rate

' that is five percent lower
than the national collegiate
average. I ~

“DUI numbers seem to
be dropping, which I’m

, pleased about,” said Lex-
ington Police Chief Bruce
Beard, “but we’re still con-
cerned about the issue.”

According to statistics
compiled by Mike Young,
director of Campus Secu~
rity, eighteen students have
been arrested in each of the
last three school years,
while 23 were arrested dur-
ing the 2001-2002 session.
Of the 77 arrests, fourteen
were laws students and the
rest were undergraduates.

“DUIS by our students
and the time spent by local
police dealing with them
have diminished consider-
ably,” Young said. “Eigh-
teen during a school year is
just two a month, and when
you consider that we have
about two thousand‘ stu-
dents partying three times
a week for thirty weeks,
eighteen arrests isn’t too
bad.” I _

K , However. if the
university’s student health
survey accurately records
the behavior of W&L
undergrads, approximately
400 students have drove
drunk during the last
‘ twelve months. Only four
percent of them were
caught by Lexington police
ofﬁcers. i

W&L’s strike system
also appears to show more
responsible drinking be

New Greeks strive for change

Historically black fraternities and sororities and SigEp take a diﬁerent view on Greek life

By Sarah Kientz
REPORTER

Five organizations are work-
ing to attract diversity and prove
that not all Greek life revolves
around the keg.

Assistant Dean of Students
Tammy Futrell is the adviser for
all the historically black orga-
nizations that have chapters on
campus, which includes the fra-
ternities Alpha Phi Alpha and
Phi Beta Sigma and the sorori-
ties Delta Sigma Theta and Al-
pha Kappa Alpha.

According to Futrell, the his-
torically black Greek organiza-
tions are fairly new on campus.

“Last year at this time we had
no Greek letter organizations of
this type on campus, so we’re
sort of going through the grow-
ing pains right now,” Futrell
said. “It’s a new thing for stu-
dents of color and for the cam-
pus overall.”

Futrell said historically black
fraternities and sororities began
on a national level to provide a

support base for African Ameri-
can students.

“These organizations were
started at a time when African
Americans were not welcomed
into majority organizations,”
Futrell said. “They offered sup-
port and friendship, and are not
as focused on the social aspect
but on community service and on
bettering the lives of others.”

Futrell also pointed out the
benefit of historically black
Greek organizations as draws for
minority students to consider
Washington and Lee.

“It’s a great recruiting tool for
students of color because they
have relatives and parents in
these organizations,” Futrell
said. “It’s something they can
identify with and an opportunity
for them to join.”

Senior Ted Archer of Phi Beta
Sigma said he and his fraternity
brothers are trying to establish
themselves this year through
community service.

“Since this is our ﬁrst full year
of existence at W&L, it makes

sense that the other Greeks are
given more attention. The Greek
system has been a part of this
school for a long time,” he said.
“I think the hard work that we
put into trying to offer something
positive and beneficial to the

“We have to be care-
ful not to treat black
Greeks as some sort
of ‘other’ category.”

TED ARCHER, CLASS OF 2006

W&L community will speak for
itself.”

According to Archer, mem-
bers of Phi Beta Sigma currently
volunteer at Maury River Middle
School and Natural Bridge twice
a month. The fraternity also
hopes to organize two other func-
tions in 2006, including a W&L

Talent Show in February and a

White Party in April where they
“hope to invite other Greeks
from close by colleges and uni-
versities.”

Archer said historically black
fraternities differ from the larger
fraternities on campus in that in-
volvement extends far past the
college experience.

“The main focus of most other
Greeks is your four—year college
career. For black Greeks, your
commitment to your organiza-
tion lasts most people their en-
tire lives because of regional
conferences, Graduate Chapters
and Distinguished Service Chap-
ters and so on,” Archer said.

“The rich history of black
Greeks, being that there are only
nine really notable ones, truly
makes them extraordinary when
you think of some of the people
who were black Greeks. People
from Dr. Martin Luther King, to
Langston Hughes, to James
Weldon Johnson, to Emmit
Smith, to even Rick James,” he
said.

Overall, Archer said the more

attention given to historically
black Greek organizations, the
more they will become as widely
accepted as the other Greeks on
campus.

“I think more exposure and
more articles such as this one is
the direction that we should stay
in because historically black fra-
ternities and sororities are a part
of university life, a part of Ameri-
can culture, a part of our rich his-

tory as a country for that matter,” .

Archer said. “We have to be
careful not to treat black Greeks
as some sort of ‘other’ category.
There are some differences be-
tween black Greeks and other
Greeks but the fundamental prin-
ciples are all the same.”

Junior Jasmine Randolph,
president of the historically black
sorority Delta Sigma Theta, said
that, like Phi Beta Sigma, the
focus of her sorority is on com-
munity service.

Greek options added

Theta are currently involved
in a tutoring and mentoring pro-
gram with Highland Park Mag-
net School in Roanoke.

According to Randolph, the
girls will be working with the
Roanoke Alumnae chapter of
DST on several of their national
service projects.

These projects include Delta
GEMS (Growing and Empower-
ing Myself Successfully), a pro-
gram targeted at preparing teen-
age African American girls for
college, and Delta Academy, a
tutoring and mentoring program
aimed at African American girls
in middle school.

Randolph wishes more atten-
tion were given to the histori-
cally black fraternities and so-
rorities.

“I feel as if the historically
black Greek organizations are
often overlooked,” she said.

“I think we really need to fo-
cus on making more people
aware of our existence on cam-
pus and letting them know what
these organizations are about.”

Randolph and two other
W&L students are involved in
the Tau Omega chapter of Delta
Sigma Theta, which is a joint
chapter between students at
W&L, Roanoke College and
Hollins University.

The chapter was chartered in

V April 2005, and Randolph hopes

that in the future Delta Sigma
Theta will become more local-
ized on W&L’s campus.

“I hope that Delta Sigma
Theta will grow in numbers on
W&L’s campus in the future and
will be more widely known
about on campus,” Randolph
said.

“I also hope that W&L will
be able to attain their own chap-
ter of DST that is not joint with
other schools, [and that] we will
be able to become more in-

tions are being asked, and lots of people are cu-

volved with the current Greek
system.”

Like Archer, Randolph noted
the difference between histori-
cally black fraternities and the
more popular Greek system on
campus in that black organiza-
tions stress the lifetime conunit—
ment of being involved in ser-
vice.

“A major difference is that
our sorority ties last a lifetime,”
Randolph said. “We still partici-
pate in the sorority even after
graduating from college and be-
cause of this we have a huge net-
working basis.”

The historically black soror-
ity Alpha Kappa Alpha is also
beginning its own chapter at
W&L.

Sophomores Yvonne Coker,
Jessica Hopper and Quiana
McKenzie are currently in-
volved in establishing a charter
here and hoping to begin the
sorority next year.

“I’ve always admired women
I knew in AKA and saw them as
hardworking, proud, outstand-
ing black women and have as-
pired to be one,” Coker said.

Coker added that Futrell and
Director of Campus Activities
Margo McClinton, both mem-
bers of AKA, have helped in-
spire the girls to continue their
efforts to establish the sorority.

Right now, Coker, Hopper
and McKenzie are focusing on
the ﬁve target areas the president
of the national AKA program
has spearheaded.

These goals include educa-
tion, the black family, health, the

economy and the arts.

The girls are currently in-
volved in community service
through Roanoke’s Beta Chi
Omega graduate chapter of
AKA.

Coker said that she is pleased
with the attention AKA has re-
ceived thus far from members of
the W&L community.

“I think awareness is being
raised, lots of questions are be-
ing asked and lots of people are
curious about AKA and the other
historically black fraternities and
sororities,” Coker said. “It’s
opened up dialogue and made
people aware of our service and
activities and are taking us more
seriously because we do want to
collaborate with other Greek life
to create a community on cam-
pus.”

Sigma Phi Epsilon (SigEp) is
also returning to campus as a dif-
ferent breed of fraternity.

According to senior Drew
Davenport, SigEp is re-coloniz-
ing at W&L after its three-year
absence.

“We’re trying to return to
W&L as a fraternity that focuses
on the fundamentals of what
frats should be about,” he said.

This includes a “sound mind
and sound body under the Bal-
anced Man program,” Daven-
port said.

“On a national level, SigEp
is trying to eliminate the ‘frat
boy’ image of Animal House.
We’re not a drinking club. We’re
focused on sharing the ideals of

' being well-balanced and well-

rounded,” he said.

Although Davenport hopes
SigEp will not be viewed as an
Animal House type of fraternity,
he also stressed that the frat will
host campus-wide activities.
“We’re not a dry fraternity, and
we’re not prohibited from hav-
ing alcohol,” Davenport said,
“but we’re not going to squash
money on parties.”

Davenport said some of the
activities SigEp has already
planned include etiquette parties
with the sororities, swing-danc-
ing lessons and art museum vis-
its.

He added that he hopes mem-
bers of the W&L community will
accept SigEp’s philosophy, al-
though it may take time.

Davenport said the W&L
chapter of SigEp needs to earn
back its charter by gaining mem-
bers and doing certain activities
in order to prove that they will
abide by the Balanced Man phi-
losophy.

Although SigEp currently has
11 members, Davenport says
they will not regain the charter
until next year.

Freshman Taylor Embury is
one of the seven freshmen plan-
ning to join SigEp.

Embury said he saw SigEp as
a middle ground between being
independent and joining one of
the more popular fraternities.

“I felt that with other fratemi—
ties you were trying to fit your-
self into a mold, and I likedthe
idea of starting from scratch
[with SigEp],” Embury said.

“Everybody feels they have to
give into the traditional fraternity
image or be independent, but we
want to be a middle ground,” he
said.

These organizations realize
that the social scene will be dif-
ficult to change, but they are
working to give students a
choice.

BEHIND
BARS

Here is the latest

update on who ran

afoul of the law during the last few
weeks. News editor Jacob Geiger took a
peek at this weekk police reports to see

what you ’ve been up to.

Lip-synch gone bad
Many freshmen enhance
their dancing skills at Lip
Synch with some alcohol.
Dana Statton,
unfortunately, didn’t quite
make it all the way home.
Instead she was arrested
near campus and charged
with DIP and underage
possession of alcohol.
Since Lip Synch is all for a
good cause, maybe the
judge will let her off light.

That makes three
issues in a row

For the third time in as
many weeks, Behind Bars
features the Lexington
labyrinth, better known as
one—way streets. This
week’s victim ran afoul of
the maze while sober.
W&L student Alex
Duckworth was ticketed at
3:01 a.m. last Sunday
morning for the by now
routine offense of driving
the wrong way on a one-
way street. Is Behind Bars
missing something here?
Has someone gone and
ripped down all of the one-
way signs in the city? Or
does the problem start with
the city itself? Why is
Preston Street a one-way
for one block? We think
the man is trying to keep us
down.

Headlights return

to haunt

While the Lexington Police
Department issued 53 DUI
citations last year, DUIDs
are far rarer. The acronym
means “Driving While
Under the Inﬂuence of
Drugs,” and Adam
Stubbleﬁeld was arrested
for just that on Dec. 1. As
is so often the case,
Stubbleﬁeld was betrayed
by his darkened headlights
as he drove around at 2:30
a.m. When the smoke
cleared, the twenty-two
year old was charged with
a DUID, driving without
headlights and the
possession of marijuana.

Family affair

On Dec. 9, Lexington
police solved the theft of a
Toshiba laptop and a set of
stereo speakers. The items
had been stolen from an
apartment on East
Washington Street on Nov.
22. Brandon Southers,
Paul Southers and Earl
Montgomery, who range in
age from 18 — 22 years,
were each arrested and
charged with one count of
grand larceny and one of
burglary. The Southers
brothers live in Lexington.
Montgomery’s address was
not listed in the arrest
docket. I

haviors. Though the num-
ber of ﬁrst strikes issued last
year, 129', was the highest
total over the last four years,
the number of second
strikes issued has fallen
from 14 during 2001-2002
to just one last year.

Both Young and Beard
credited the Traveller
shuttle system for cutting
downdrunkdriving. “Trav-
eller is available through
reasonable hours, and that’s
had an impact on the drop
in drunken driving rates,”
Young said.

“We really want to thank
the staff and students over
at W&L for the programs
they’ve put in place,” Beard
added. “They’ve worked
out very well, and I hope the
programs can continue.”

W&L’s Traveller pro-
gram has been student-run
since it began operation.
The group’s steering com-
mittee is currently led by
senior Katelyn Giarratana.

, ,C,urrently, Traveller of-W
fers two services: dispatch"
V and express. The expfess”
' service consists of four

shuttle buses that follow a
set route from 10:00 pm.
until 2:00a.m. on Wednes-
day, Friday, and Saturday
nights. The buses follow a
set route that visits the
freshmen dorms, the frater-
nity and sorority houses and
several popular off campus
party sites such as Windfall
Hill and the Pole Houses.

'l‘raveller’s dispatch sys-
tem operates seven nights a
week; dispatch drivers will
take people to houses not on
the regular bus route or pro-
vide transit when the buses
are not running.

Beard’s department
made 53. DUI arrests last
year, an average of between
four and ﬁve a month. Lex-
ington officers made ﬁve ar-
rests during December and
three in January. The
Rockbridge Country
Sheriff’s office reported
making 60 DUI arrests dur-
ing that same time span.

Beard, whose depart-
ment receives state grants
for DUI enforcement, said
that every winter
Lexington’s officers partici-
pate in a statewide drunk
driving crackdown called
“Safe, Smart and Sober.”

The program, which runs
from mid—Noven1ber until
January, is designed to dis-
courage dmnk driving dur-
ing the holiday season.

According to the Na-
tional Highway Traffic
Safety Administration
(NHTSA), Virginia had 925
driving death in 2004. Of
those deaths, 39 percent in-
volved at least one person
with aBAC greater than .02,

and 33 percent involved at ..

least one person with a BAC
above the legal limit of .08.
Further contributing to the
problem is the fact that more

A than half of the people

killed in Virginia accidents
were not wearing a seat belt.

Nati0na_1lly,40percentof I
’ fatal" accidents involve at

DUI arrest
rates drop  

least one person who has a
BAC above .01, whereas in
1982 60 percent of fatal ac-
cidents made the same
claim.

While total auto—related
fatalities in Virginia have
remained constant over the
last thirty years, their fre-
quency has diminished.
While 1975 saw 2.87 deaths
per million miles traveled in
Virginia, 2004 statistics re-
ported a ratio of only 1.17
deaths per million miles.

Though W&L students
drive drunk far less often
today than they did ten years
ago, undergraduates and
law students still receive
DUIs each year.

Aside from the legal.

ramifications associated
with a DUI conviction, stu-
dents also face action from
the Student Judicial Coun-
cil (SJC). Though SJC
guidelines suggest a suspen-
sion for students convicted
of charges, over the last
two years the council has
chosen alternative punish-
ments-. ,M°s.t DUI punish-
ments_liave_  a strike
—— sometimes with the fine,
sometimes without ~ social
and conduct probation and
between 100-200 hours of
community service. Some-
times the SJC requires that
a certain portion of the
hours be completed inside
Rockbridge County.

In at least two cases last
year, the SJC was forced to
deal with a senior only
weeks away from gradua-
tion. In both incidents the
council assessed 150 hours
of community service while
requesting that the adminis-
tration withhold the
student’s diploma and deny
him/her the right to walk at
graduation.

Though the SIC has sug-
gested guidelines for pun-
ishment, the council consid-
ers every case individually
and decides on an appropri-
ate punishment. Some stu-
dents also choose to with-
draw after DUI charges, so
the SJC does not see every
case involving drunk driv-
ing. _.

Almost every year the
SJC also hears cases where

underage students have i,

been arrested for driving
with a BAC between .01
and .08. The council has
usually found those students
not guilty of drunk driving
but guilty of violating the
university’s alcohol poli-
cies.‘ Those students are
usually assessed a strike and
a smaller amount of com».
munity service.
Thoughthe S.lC’s DUI

caseload has remained rela- . ’

tively constant over the last
four years, Beard and Young

both feel.that‘W&L students’
aregfinally getting the mes-B 

sage about drunk driving
and taking advantage of

safer means of transporta-.

tion.
“I remember 15 years

ago DUI rates around here 2

were twice what they are

_ now.” Beard said. “Stu-
dents really seem to bedo-, .

ing a good job this year.”

It’s been a record setting
week for the Washington and
Lee women’s basketball
team.

Last week, the girls de-
feated Emory and Henry,
scoring a school—record 89
points.

The Roanoke game see-
sawed throughout the first
half, and the Generals found
themselves down by two at
the start of the second half.

After Roanoke went on a
10-0 run in the ﬁrst six n1in—
utes, W&L stepped up its play
and came back to take the

lead with nine minutes left.

Roanoke kept the game close
until the ﬁnal minutes, trailing by
only one point with 1:28 left.

In the ﬁnal 1:05 of the game,
freshman guard Bethany
Ridenhour iced the win, hitting
ﬁve of six free throws in the last
minute.

Senior center Jessica
Hunsinger became just the sixth
General to reach the 1,000 point
mark, scoring a team-high 23
points in the win.

Senior guard Louisa Feve
added a season—high 21 points.
Feve also led the team in assists
with six.

Feve was excited about defeat-
ing Roanoke for the ﬁrst time in

Records fall in b-ball

school history, saying, “It was an
awesome win.”

Hunsinger said, “In all honesty,
the reason why the E&H game had
a record setting score was a direct
result of Emory and Henry’s style
of playing. They play a very fast
paced game with quick
shots which allows for more pos-
sessions and thus more scoring.”

Hunsinger was pleased with
the team’s play, saying, “The fact
that we were able to keep up with
their pace is respectable. We also
played pretty good defense which
kept them below their 86.6 scor-
ing average per game.”

Another school record was set
when W&L had three players
notch double—doubles.

Feve scored 16 points to go
along with her 10 rebounds and
six assists. Hunsinger added 15
points, 15 rebounds and seven
blocks.

Feve said, “Our season has
had some ups and downs, but
things seem to be going pretty
well right now. Hopefully these
games mark the start of lots of
wins to come.”

Hunsinger echoed her feel-
ings, saying “This season has
had its rough points but we
have been working extra hard
off.

“I have high hopes for the
next six games and have full
confidence that we can win
every single one of them,” she
said.

Lax looks

Women’s lacrosse ranked sixth in pre-season

By Elliott Walker
surr warren

The women’s lacrosse team
posted their best season in school
history last year. They had an
overall record of 15-4, 8-0 for con-
ference games, won their third
straight ODAC title and won their
first-ever NCAA tournament
game. The team was ranked 13 in
the nation by Lacrosse Magazine is
preseason poll.

Unfortunately, not all the news
is good.

The team lost eight starters
from last season. Some wonder
if that loss will hinder the team’s
performance this year, but it
doesn’t seem to faze this team in
the least. Our goals are the “same
as every year,” said junior Avery
Lovejoy. She and team captain
Kate Lester said the team’s goal
is to win ODACs again and get
even further in the NCAA touma-
ment than last year.

“That would be spectacular,”
said she.

The team has four returning all-
ODAC performers from last sea-
son, two of which serve as cap-
tains alongside Lester. Amanda
Strickler and Rachel Wallick, con-
sidered to be offensive and defen-
sive powerhouses, respectively,
were both chosen for ﬁrst team
honors. Strickler and Wallick are
two of 18 returning players. “The
diversity of players who are scor-
ing threats this year is at an un-
precedented high level,” said

Strickler. The team has also
gained six freshmen.

“This year has a lot of poten-
tial,” Lester said. The team plans
to play several out of conference
games against some of the top-
ranked Division III teams. “Will-
iams is always a big one,” said
Lovejoy.

They’re ranked sixth by La-
crosse Magazine. In addition, the
team will tackle other nationally
ranked opponents St. Mary’s,
Franklin & Marshall and Colorado
College, one of the final four
teams in 2005.

Playing some of the best
schools in D—HI lacrosse is some-
thing that Lester says makes the
team stronger.

Lovejoy also mentioned that
the team has added several Divi-
sion I drills to their practice rou-
tine to up their level of play.

The team also boasts extreme
team unity. “If everyone decides
to pick it up as a team, then the
results are much easier to come
by,” Sarah Tilbor, a sophomore,
said.

Their ability to work so well
together is something Strickler
believes has enabled the team to
win ODACS for the past three
years.

The women’s lacrosse team
isn’t planning on going anywhere
but up this season. Their first
game is scheduled for Saturday,
Feb. 25 at St. Mary's. Their first
home game will follow on
Wednesday, March 1.

“If everyone decides to pick it up as a team,

then the results are much easier to come by.”

Outlook bright as opening day nears

Baseball team looks to build on previous successﬁil years

By Tom Bush
STAFF WRITER

Expectations are high for this
year’s baseball team. The Gener-
als are coming off a 27—win sea-
son, one short of a school record,
and are returning with nearly ev-
ery starter. The Generals failed to
win the ODAC tournament, fall-
ing to Hampden-Sydney and
Lynchburg in the semiﬁnals.

“This year our goal is to win
the [ODAC] tournament, and
move into NCAA play,” says se-
nior outﬁelder and team captain
Dave Mackenzie. “Anything less
would be a disappointment.”

The Generals return an excep-
tional pitching staff. The rotation
is led by junior right-hander
Clayton Edwards. Edwards com-
piled an 8-4 record last season,
with a 2.52 ERA in 71 innings.

“He was huge for us last year,”
says junior outfielder/second
baseman David Miller.

Behind Edwards is a pair of
southpaws, junior Johnson
Brownlow and sophomore John
Parker. Brownlow was second on
the team in innings pitched and
strikeouts, throwing 56.1 frames
and blowing away 40 batters.
Parker, despite a sub—75 MPH
fastball, found success during his
freshman season with excellent
control, walking just three batters

in nearly 52 innings.

In addition, says Mackenzie,
“We need our young sophomore
pitchers to become more mature
and fulﬁll leadership roles on the
team.”

The sophomores he is referring
to include Tim Livingston, Steve
Marcott, Myke Mulhem and Jeff
Pharis, a group which will be ex-
pected to solidify the bullpen and
consistently close out games.

“Marcott and Livingston were
two guys who showed ﬂashes last
year and could, end up ﬁlling (a
closing) role,” said junior out-
ﬁelder Richard Garland.

The Generals will also count
on what Edwards calls an “ar-
mada” of freshmen pitching, in-
cluding right—handers Brendan
Clark, Andrew Henderson and
Chris Sherwin.

Junior catcher Jordan Wesley
believes the pitching staff will
“have to lead us through the tough
games.”

The Generals’ lineup will also
look very familiar to a year ago.
Gone is catcher Xak Bausch and
third baseman Adam Bullock, but
replacements Wesley and Edwards
(when not pitching), should have
little problem ﬁlling their shoes.
Wesley hit .347 with 30 RBIs a
year ago, starting 32 games at
catcher and designated hitter.

“I’ll have to play solid behind

the plate,” says Wesley, “It’s some-
thing I’ve directed most of my fo-
cus to.”

Also returning to the lineup are
seniors Mackenzie, Taylor
McConnell and Scott Gosselink,
as well as juniors Garland and
Miller.

First-basemen McConnell ex-
ploded last year, setting season
records for hits (67), doubles (24),
RBI (56) and total bases (114). His
.427 batting average and 7 home
runs were both team highs as well.
McConnell is expected to anchor
the lineup again this year. Miller
hit .391 in a school—record 161 at-
bats, and was a First team All-
ODAC selection his sophomore
year. Garland should continue to
provide power to the heart of the
lineup, as he hopes to build on the
success of last year (.326 BA/4
HR/30 RBI).

Gosselink, who hit .349 and
led the team in runs and stolen
bases a year ago, is expected to
move to second base this year. The
shift will open up room for junior
Ray Sweeney to play shortstop
and provide defensive help on the
left side of the inﬁeld.

“Ray will be one of, if not the
best fielding shortstop in the
ODAC,” stated Miller. Rounding
out the lineup is Mackenzie. He’ll
return to centerfield, where he
started all 40 games a year ago.

“There are no weaknesses,”
says a conﬁdent Edwards.

Now in his 20'“ season, Head
Coach Jeff Stickley is optimistic,
but says it is a little early to tell.

“We did lose a good catcher
and solid third baseman from last
year,” says Stickley, “But I feel
like the guys can step in and do a
good job.”

Stickley maintains that the
players’ experience and ability to
play several positions will be ex-
tremely positive attributes to this
year's team.

A three-time ODAC Coach of
the Year, Stickley has had enor-

 

mous success over the past seven
seasons, tallying a record of 158-
87. Players say that his laid back
attitude is a big reason why.

“He lets us play, because he
knows we can, but gets on us if
we let up any,” says Wesley, “It’s
a great environment and he keeps
the game fun, which is key at such
a demanding academic school.”

Garland agrees, saying, “He
trusts his players’ abilities, (and)
knows when he needs to do some-
thing to get us going.”

So how does the coach himself
attribute his great success?

“Certainly we have had good

players over the last several years,
and the attitude and work ethic has
regenerated itself from year to
year,” says Stickley, deﬂecting the
attention from himself. “As you
know, good players make good
coaches.”

The Generals kick off the sea-
son Feb. l3 against Piedmont in
Atlanta, Georgia. Despite a difﬁ—
cult non-conference schedule, the
Generals believe the lofty expec-
tations are justiﬁed.

“I think 30 wins is a reasonable
expectation from this team,” re-
marks Garland. Here’s to hoping
he’s right.

The word still makes
you blush.

And now, The Vagina
Monologues are coming.

Although views of
femininity have changed
positively in recent years,
society still has a long way
to go, according to a coali-
tion of students here at
Washington and Lee.
These students have been
rehearsing for perfor-
mances of the intemation—
ally acclaimed show The
Vagina Monologues, to be
performed later this week.

The Vagina Mono-
logues is part of an inter-
national campaign, known
as V-Day, to combat vio-
lence against women and
girls.

Stephanie Yost, Vice
President of the Women’s
Law Students Organiza-
tion (WLSO), has been
working since July to

‘The Vagina Monologues’ help students think

INSIDE THE

 

bring the show back to
campus in conjunction
with the campus—wide cel-
ebration of 20 years of
women at W&L.

The show consists of a
series of monologues by
playwright Eve Ensler,
that are performed at hun-
dreds of colleges around
the United States every
year.

WLSO sponsored the
first showing of the mono-
logues at W&L two years
ago. There are plans to
continue performances of
the show every other year,
according to Yost, who re-
cruited fellow law student
Kristal High to direct the
show.

Senior Kristine Holda
became involved in the
show through her interest
in theater and after finding
out that it was coming
back to campus early last
month. She saw the per-
formance as a sophomore
and became even more in-

trigued when she read the
monologues for class.
Each monologue fo-
cuses on a specific transi-
tive moment in the lives of
women. The monologues
have been described as
provocative and challeng-
ing because they address
women’s issues head on.
According to Holda,
“these monologues show
how delicately powerful
the female body, mind and
soul really are. . .when
women don’t understand
their own bodies or their
sexuality, that becomes a
deep personal problem.”
The cast and crew of

the show are very excited
to have the opportunity to
bring the show back to
campus. Third—year law
student Jillian DiLaura, di-
rector of the show two
years ago, said, “It’s very
easy to become isolated in
Lexington and forget
about other issues.” Those
involved are eager to chal-

 

lenge students to think and
to examine the way they
think about women and
how they should act.

“My hope is that audi-
ences here at W&L will
earnestly engage with the
show,” said assistant direc-
tor and second-year law
student Wes J arrell. “They
may find themselves re-
evaluating assumptions
they didn’t know they had,
and. . .the fact that they
have that dialogue within
themselves or with others
will make the show a suc-
cess.”

However, the show is
about more than just rais-
ing awareness; it is also
about raising money. Each
year V—Day picks a differ-
ent issue to fund and ad-
dress directly. The rest of
the money raised goes to

support local Women’s is-
sue efforts.

This year’s issue high-
lights the plight of “com-
fort women” exploited by
the Japanese military in
World War II.

The rest of the money
from the tickets and t-
shirts being sold in the
Commons will go to sup-
porting Safehome Systems
in Covington, Va.

WLSO is also collect-
ing supplies for Project
Horizon, an advocacy
group and shelter for
abused women and girls
here in Rockbridge
County.

“The show is really an
eye-opener and not really
what you expect it to be,”
said Holda. “It says all the
things that most women
are afraid to say.”

Performances will be in the Johnson Theater on Feb. 9 and 10
at 7 p.m. Tickets can be purchased in the Commons and at the
Law School Brief Stop from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. this week.

‘Alba’ selected
to showcase
the talents ‘of a
predominantly
female theater

department

By E.J. Boyer
STAFF WRITER

Although Washington and

Lee remains one of the few
universities in the nation

where male students outnum-

ber female students, there is
one place on campus that

most of the men avoid, and it

isn’t the srat houses. It is the
stage at the Lenfest Center.

The ratio of actresses to
actors on our campus is
“Nine or ten to one,” says
Thomas “T” Anderson, the
Theater Depa1tment’s Tech-
nical Director. That imbal-
ance presents a particular
challenge to the Theater De-
partment: finding plays with
mostly female roles.

That challenge is height-
ened, said Anderson, by the
fact that “modem drama
underserves women.”

Theater Professor Kim-
berly Jew says that Lenfest’s

current drama, The House of

Bernarda Alba, represents
that rare dramatic produc-

tion—a play featuring an all
female cast performing what
Jew, the director, calls
“meaty roles.”

The play, framed by death
and family conﬂict, turns on
the oppressive reign of the
widow Bernarda Alba over
her five daughters. After the
death of her husband,
Bemarda imposes an an
eight—year mourning period
on the household, forbidding
her daughters, aging towards
spinsterhood, to have any in-
teraction with men—even in
conversation. It is a lifestyle
they resent.

Although the play takes
place in a rural Spanish vil-
lage during the early 20th
century, the actresses are cos-
tumed in clothes from differ-
ent eras as a means of em-
phasizing what Jew calls the
“archetypal experience of
women.” Bernarda, the over-
bearing mother, is dressed in
full Victorian garments, in-
cluding a corset, to highlight
her oppressive, frozen-in-
time personality.

In the course of the play,
Bernarda’s daughters display
different degrees of rebellion
against their mother, which is
illustrated by their dress. The
oldest daughter, Angustias, is
the most inﬂuenced by her
mother, and dresses therefore
in “quasi-Victorian” clothes
that gives her a close resem-
blance to Bemarda. The sec-
ond daughter, Magdalena,
appears in empire—waist

dresses that were popular
around 1900. Bemarda’s
middle daughter, Amelia, is
costumed in ﬂapper—style
dresses, from the 1920’s that
feature dropped waistlines.
The fourth daughter,
Martirio, wears l930’s style
clothing. The youngest and
most rebellious daughter,
Adela, is placed in the
l950’s, on the edge of rock-
and roll, and even appears in
a bright green dress despite

her household’s strict moum— ‘

ing period. Costume designer
Jessica Miller said this cos-
tume scheme “showed that as
the characters got younger in
age, they also got younger in
time.”

Anderson suggests that the
costuming from different eras
illustrates a political point:
the “problems that women
suffer really haven’t .
changed.”

Jew touches on this in the
director’s note of the pro-
gram.

She wrote that the play
“presented the entirety of the
Women’s experience—her
youth, middle years, and ma-
turity—asking us to
consider. . .a society that 
twists and deforms the most

V basic human impulses and re-

lationships we possess.”

If it all sounds a bit like a
Gender’s Studies exercise, it
is not wholly the fault of the
Theater Department. Blame
it on the Lenfest—shy men of
W&L.

 A, Speak Week, a re-

Kathekon’s effort to in-

the speaking tradition. It
planned Speak Week to

‘encourage students to

adhere to the tradition
despite these ‘changes in

forts to keep the speak-

‘ ing tradition alive,” said

Kathekon member
Meghan loss, senior.
“Of the many traditions
that make our campus
unique, it is among the
most important to pre-
serve.”

loss considered the
speaking tradition’s 213‘
century threats.

, “Especially since the
cellphone issue has
been brought up, I think
students are making a
concerted effort. . . when
they are walking and
talking on the phone,”
she said. “The iPod, on
the other hand, need-
lessly impedes ‘speak-
ing."’

Junior Laura Pekman
agreed. .

“Since I've bee
here, I haven ’t seen dras-
tic changes in the speak-
ing tradition—~the same
amount of people are on
cell phones, the "same
amount of people are

, rushing. It should be

better, but I don’t think
it’s on a decline,” she
said.

Although cell phones
and iPods are modern
phenomena, fear over
the speaking tradition’s
decline is not. The Ring-
tum Phi began printing
letters to the editor con-
cerning the status of the
speaking tradition as far
back as 1928.

At that time, an As- _

similation Committee
strictly enforced the
speaking tradition, along
with other established
practices like wearing
“freshmen caps,” dress-
ing up for class, and not
‘Walking on the lawn.
These traditions made
up the “honorable be-
havior” advocated by
President Robert E. Lee
the century before.

The committee of up-
perclassmen reported
and fined students who
did not comply. No such

. committee exists today,

but the responsibility of
upholding the speaking
tradition still relies on
upperclassmen. »

f“It would be awk-
ward if you forced
people to say hi,” said
sophomore Chony Lu.

a “Most peopie try to do

  peaking
 radition
still alive

Speak Week promotes courtesy

it, and I think that’s
enough to show the
school's friendliness.”
This friendliness can
help ease freshmen into
their first semester at
Washington and Lee.
“Being from the
north, any sort of speak-

ing tradition would‘

phase me for a while.
After visiting my friends
at other schools, I real-
ized how nice it is to
have the speaking tradi-
tion here,” said freshman
Shreya Durvasula.

No other institution
has a historically estab-
lished speaking tradition
comparable to W&L’s.
A 1941 Ring-tum Phi
editorial claimed the tra-
dition “helps make the
difference between two
schools like Washington
and Lee and the Univer-
sity‘of Virginia.”

Duke Univcrsity’s
student newspaper, The
Chronicle, even ran a
column last month advo-
cating the school adopt
a similar tradition.

“The much-admired
‘Speaking Tradition’ at
Washington and Lee
University was imple-

mented by Robert E. Lee - L
200 years ago and is still 7' S

upheld today,” writes
Jane Chang. “I hereby
officially propose we es-
tablish a speaking tradi-
tion of our own.”

The Student Recruit-
ment Committee finds
the speaking tradition’s
uniqueness a point of in-
terest for prospectives
on tours. It shows how
the school values com-
munity.

“(The speaking tradi-
tion] is a simple act but

one whose meaning and
value we should not un-
derestimate,” said late
President John W. Elrod
in his 1995 Inaugural
Address. “We are fortu-
nate, indeed privileged,
to live in such a commu-
nity where the dignity
and value of each person
is incarnated in commu-
nity—deﬁning traditions
and which calls upon
each of its members to
relate through them.”

For many, the exist-
ence of these values at
W&L will perpetuate the

practice of the speaking A

tradition.
“Every year,
doomsayers report that

the Speaking Tradition is _

dying away. Granted, it
is no longer strictly en-
forced, but this special
tradition has proved its
durability,” said writer
losh Manning in a 1990
Ring-tum Phi article.

“The faculty and stu-
dents make W&L what
it isacademically, the di-
verse variety of activities
make it what it is so-
cially, the Honor System
makes it what it is ethi-
cally. The Speaking Tra-
dition, however, makes
W&L a home.”

A journalistic approach

Like predecessors, the Phi uses truth to defend the reporting behind weekly news feature on student arrests

Recently, the Phi achieved
something most newspapers only
dream of.

People have been reading to
page two.

What they ﬁnd there, among
advertisements and secondary
news stories, is the truth.

The truth is, we are college
students who make mistakes.
Sometimes these mistakes result
in a ticket, or an arrest.

In our weekly news feature,
Behind Bars, we report brieﬂy
on local police reports——which,
more often than not, include
many student arrests.

Not only are these reports a
simple matter of public record,
which could be easily accessed
by any caring citizen, but also,
they contain something every

journalist hungers for: news.

In 1735, Andrew Hamilton
successfully argued truth as a
defense for this.

Today, many of the student
arrests could easily provide the
Phi with material for a front—page
news story.

Realizing the sensitivity to
social exposure on campus,
we’ve reduced them to second-
page briefs.

In an attempt to provide some
level of anonymity for embar-
rassed students, we also chose to
print only the students’ initials.
(You’ll notice we have begun
printing full names. This is based
on recent legal advice.)

There is a phenomenon—-or
should we say phobia?--at this
school: people pack their skel-

vodka and then try to drive home. You did those

things...the Phi is holding you responsible.”

etons neatly away in their clos-
ets, until the closet is full and the
stench is unbearable.

In short, you are afraid of the
truth.

A clause of our mission state-
ment, publshed Jan. 16, states our
desire to hold you accountable
for your actions--and we’re do-
ing just that.

Some students have ques-
tioned the journalistic integrity of
printing these news briefs.

True: the style of the briefs——

Police blotter supported by facts

To the Editor:

A letter in last week’s Phi
complained of the sassy com-
mentary attached to the police
briefs in “Behind Bars,” suggest-
ing that the writer of this weekly
feature would likely be ashamed
to show it to W&L’s journalism
professors.

We professors in Reid Hall
prefer to keep our judgments on
student publications quiet, out of
respect for their autonomy and
hoping for robust, uninhibited
student journalism. But I will say
that the writer of “Behind Bars”

has nothing to be ashamed of.
These items come from open
records, your basic police blot-
ter available for all to see — with
the full names of those charged
rather than the initials, which the
Phi chooses to use for some rea-
son.

It’s great to see actual report-
ing being done. As for the com-
mentary, of course this isn’t the
style of police—blotter news in a
typical newspaper. But the Phi
is a campus paper. This is fair
comment, perfectly legal and in
keeping with the broader tradi-

tions of journalism. I’d much
rather see attitude with good re-
porting than attitude without re-
porting, which seems to pre-
dominate in the weaker campus
papers across the land. And what
more important issue is there for
commentary, in the realm of stu-
dent life here, than the excessive
and underage drinking that ac-
counts for most of the semi-
anonymous student cases that

end up in “Behind Bars”?

How to stop assault

To the Editor:

I want to applaud the staff of
The Ring-tum Phi for openly
coming out in last week’s issue
and condemning the prolific
sexual assault that occurs on this
campus. Both papers have put
together informative articles on
the most recent statistics released
from the Health Surveys, but the
staff of The Ring-tum Phi took it
a step further, and it heartens me
to know that there are still people
on this campus who are willing to
show that they have a conscience.
There’s more to life than drinking
and hooking-up; there are some
severe problems that plague this
campus.

My only fear is that last week’s
Phi article will amount to nothing
more than fiery rhetoric,
effectively rousing our passions
for a short while, only to allow
them to wither into apathy once
more. In my three years here, I
have witnessed a conspicuous lack
of action on the part of students;

we are guilty of saying one thing,‘

but doing another, or more likely,
doing nothing. I want to issue a
challenge to every student on this
campus who feels passionately
about an issue: Put your money
where your mouth is. If, in this
instance, you are tired of hearing
about sexual assault and how
Washington and Lee consistently
experiences twice the usual
incidence of sexual assault, then
do something about it. We are

. fighting a culture that has for

decades not overtly supported, but
tacitly allowed this egregious
behavior to be perpetrated with
virtual impunity. Perhaps we want

to label this “tradition,” though I
hardly think anybody would want
to claim sexual assault as this
institution’s legacy. Regardless,
this is a learned behavior. Maybe
I’m just being hopeful and not
wanting to believe that this
university would admit an
inordinately high number of
sexual predators into its ranks, but
I think it’s hard to argue against
the assertion that the environment
of this school plays a signiﬁcant
role in creating problems such as
sexual assault. The question, then,

If you are tired of
sexual assualt and
its myriad of

problems, then do

something about it.
 

is how do we change things? The
answer, it seems to me, is a matter
of greater personal accountability.

First off, students must be
cognizant of their own actions,
especially in situations where
sexual assaults are most likely to
occur, namely at parties. Alcohol
is a contributing factor in a vast
majority of sexual assaults, and
this appears to be one of the
easiest problems to remedy. I’d
like to see more men and women
stand up for their friends at parties:
chastise them if they are too drunk
and about to make a stupid hook-
up, cock-block on all accounts,
resort to public humiliation if

necessary, but do whatever it takes
to keep your friends out of
potentially dangerous sexual
situations.

Secondly, students should
educate themselves about this
topic. Each year, the university
brings in speakers to talk about
these subjects, but frequently the
audience is sparse and ﬁlled with
the same people time and again.
Three times a year, Project
Horizon holds volunteer training
to prepare individuals who want
to volunteer at their shelter, and
this experience provides
invaluable information on the
issues of domestic, dating, and
sexual violence.

Lastly, get involved! If you
really are tired of sexual assault
and its myriad problems, then do
something about it. Men, join 1
in 4 and become an active member
in an organization that is working
hard to put an end to this problem.
Women, join SPEAK, a new
women’s group designed to
educate women about the issue of
sexual assault. Men and women
should look into the Gender
Relations Committee or LIFE, two
organizations that are also
working together to combat the
problems of sexual assault. There
is certainly no shortage of outlets
for positive action.

My point in this letter is to
show that words are often not
enough to precipitate change. It’s
time for students to follow up their
rhetoric with actions, and for those
actions to align with what is being
said, lest we become hypocrites.

Also true: this is a college

There are no children in our

The “joumalistic integrity,”
then, comes from the acquisition

which is pertinent to campus.

Undemocratic democracy

Palestinian politics need to escape tyrannical agenda of terrorism to gain power; reach peace in the Middle East

By Jennifer Sutton
C 0 L U M N IS T

In a world where radicalism
reigns, the election of the
politically-extreme Hamas comes
as no surprise.

With signs of stability after
riding the storm that ensued from
Israel’s disengagement plan in the
Gaza Strip, things ﬁnally begin to
look up for a region marked by
years of conﬂict and tragedy.

It seems wrong to point ﬁngers
at the Israelis for their recent
reforms and the Bush
administration’s road—map to
peace.

But this nice facade had no
role in repairing a defunct system
that had corrupted the Palestinian
people for years, the Fatah
Movement.

There have been various
historical issues with the land
(issues which have resulted in
overt aggression by the Arab
League on numerous occasions).

These problems in Gaza and
parts of the West Bank (which
began with Israeli acquisition in
1967) were exacerbated when
Clinton and Yitzhak Rabin, the
late Israeli Prime Minister,

“This undoubtedly corrupt terrorist

organization did something everyone else

failed to do: it recognized the

Palestinians’ domestic issues.”

JENNIFER SUTTON, CLASS OF 2009

revived the formerly ousted
revolutionary terrorist Yasser
Arafat from the outskirts of
Tunisia. ‘

Perhaps they felt compelled to
find a fitting leader for the
Palestinian people. Instead, for
lack of better options, they aimed
at converting a bona-fide terrorist
whose prior claim to fame was the
head of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO).

This organization was
comprised to wreak havoc on
Israelis world-wide until they
became extinct or were thrown
into the sea, which ever came first.

In retrospect, this decision was
clearly erroneous.

At the time world leaders felt

that Arafat’s secular outlook was
a comparable neutralizer to
Hamas’ radically religious
fundamentalism.

My objective here is not to
criticize Clinton because Rabin
held an equally responsible role in
Arafat’s revival.

It is important to take note that
Clinton’s administration did little
to mitigate the harm caused by
Arafat’s anival.

There were the much-touted
Oslo Accords, which failed
miserably, due in part to Arafat’s
refusal to take the steps necessary
to achieve peace.

This deal resulted in Ehud
Barak offering an obscene amount
of land and Arafat blatantly

rejecting it, which resulted in the
second intifada.

Then of course, there was
Hilary Clinton’s infamous gaffe
where she kissed a corrupt Suha
Arafat who had just accused
Israelis of poisoning the milk of
Palestinian babies.

No one, not the world
community or the US held, Arafat
or Fatah accountable for their
behavior.

Thus, there is no doubt that
prior presidential administrations
and world-leaders played a role in
reviving the terrorists whose wide-
spread corruption was a catalyst
for Hamas’ recent win.

Instead of attempting to aid the
Palestinian people who he claims
to have fought for, Arafat spent
years funneling aid money, meant
to feed and educate impoverished
children and rebuild infrastructure
in war-tom parts of the West Bank
and Gaza, to his family and their
cronies.

While Suha lived the high-life
on the Charnps—Elysee, millions of
Palestinians remained without
proper health-care or aid.

Yet one is forced to ask where
the UN, America and the Western
world were during those
formidable years.

Nowhere in sight evidently
because there was clearly no
regulation of the billions of dollars
being sent to the corrupt PLO,
who was quickly siphoning it
away.

Ironically, the only people
who allegedly seemed to ‘help’
these forgotten people was
Hamas, a militant Islamic group
whose primary objective is to
destroy the state of Israel.

They provided health-care,
education, summer-camps and
other forms of infrastructure to the
Palestinian people.

These summer-camps teach
children to throw grenades, glorify
and encourage martyrdom, and
employ textbooks which neglect
to recognize the existence of Israel

Furthermore, they promote
rampant propaganda and anti-
Seinitism, implying they too had
an agenda.

This undoubtedly corrupt
terrorist organization did
something everyone else failed to
do: it recognized the Palestinians
domestic issues and sought to
effectively fix their welfare.

Unfortunately, for Abbas and
Bush’s sake, their time to reign
came far too late. Bush, who
would not deal with Arafat, and

Abbas, who was the first
Palestinian leader to make actual
strides on the road—map to peace,
when presented with huge road-
blocks, did too little, too late.

Now the tables have shifted
from the optimism that beset the
region only months earlier. Hamas
is now running the show, Fatah is
officially defunct, Bush is
continuing to promote democracy
in regions where radicalism
prevails and Ariel Sharon is
essentially comatose after
revamping Israeli politics. Is there
any way to rectify the major
mistakes of the past?

The Westem—world is ﬁnally
trying, after years of criticizing the
Israelis (excluding America) and
sitting on the sidelines taking jabs
at the Prime Ministers of Israel.

The Big Four have agreed to
freeze aid to the region until
Hamas revamps its political
charter, but this is only a first step
in fixing the issue.

This is a wake-up call to the
Fatah movement, showing them
that their war-lord ways have
reached an end, and it is time to
either step up to the plate or allow
radicalism and propaganda to ruin
whatever hope is left in the
region.
