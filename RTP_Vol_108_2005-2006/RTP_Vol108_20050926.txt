BY THE STUDENTS AND FOR THE STUDENTS SINCE 1897

Business is blooming

Despite concerns, Lexington shop owners prove that they have a green thumb for success

By Jacob Geiger
R E P O R T E R

Despite the closure last spring
of College Town Shops and
Graden’s Shoe Store, proprietors
throughout the downtown area
insist Lexington’s historic down-
town business district is doing just
ﬁne.

Shop owners across the busi-
ness spectrum — from Al Carter at
Alvin-Dennis to Julie Lindsey at
Virginia Born and Bred ~ ﬁrmly
denied any reports that suggest the
downtown area is slumping.

Carter, who opened his upscale
clothing store on the corner of
Washington and Jefferson in 1963
and now runs it with the help of
his daughter, mentioned that
Graden’s didn’t shut down be-
cause of ﬂagging sales.

“I think his wife, a doctor, just
took a job in a different city,”
Carter reported. “Besides, some-
one moved right into the space and
started up another business.”

Julie Lindsey has owned Vir-
ginia Born and Bred since 1993;
the store has operated under that
name since it opened in 1986. She
says the key to her business lies
in catalogue and online sales.

“Those sales help as much as
anything; they’re just as important
to my business as the walk—in sales
are.”

Lindsey also credits the Lex-
ington Downtown Development
Association’s Main Street pro-
gram as well as what she called
“a very active Chamber of Com-
merce” for the area’s success.

Sammy Moore, a Lexington
native who has been the executive
director of the Chamber for twelve
years, concurred with much of
what the shop owners had to say.

“What goes out the back door
of these stores — in catalogue or
intemet sales — is every bit as im-
portant as what goes out the front
door.

During his twelve years at the
Chamber of Commerce Moore has
developed something of a mantra
for the city: “Lexington does what
it does well.’’

He said, “the business commu-
nity realizes that students and tour-
ists are the main customers. Some
shop owners have told me that
their gross sales during W&L Par-

ents’ Weekend can exceed gross
sales for the months of January or
February.”

When asked if the arrival of
Wal-Mart had hurt downtown,
Moore, whose family ran a down-
town food business for over forty

years, said it had just made things
different, not necessarily worse.

“This is a different downtown
then it was 30 years ago; back then
you had small hardware stores,
grocery stores, and even car
dealerships.

ILLUSTRATION: EMILY HULEN

What Wal-Mart has done, he
said, is force shop-owners to be
better at what they do.

“We can’t compete with their
prices, so we have to provide
something on the service end that
you can’t get out there.” Carter,

to?
VOLUME elf, NUMBER 5

owner of Alvin-Dennis, even ar-
gued that the downtown area is ac-
tually stronger than it was back in
1963.

“When I opened my store,” he
said, “Washington Street hardly
had any businesses on it. Now it’s
full of newer shops, and once the
Dutch Inn gets ﬁxed up it’ll spruce
up the street even more.”

Dan Vance of the Edward
Jones Investment Group believes
that marketing is a key to success
downtown.

“Pumpkinseeds probably has
the best marketing in town.
They’ve ﬁgured out how to mar-
ket to out-of-town folks. Some of
the locals think the stuff that gets
sold in there is crazy, but visitors
seem to love it.”

While Vance points to Pump-
kinseeds as a success story, he also
notes that some spaces seem to
always be turning over. Both he
and Lindsey mentioned a bakery
on Washington Street that seems
to change hands on an annual ba-
sis. I

“Things definitely aren’t per-
fect here,” Vance concluded, “but
what in life is perfect?”

The Lexington business com-
munity is also lucky to have a
strong support network.

Lindsey credited the local his-
torical society for “keeping down-
town looking nice. They make
sure nobody tries to do something
silly like paint a building orange.
They’re really in charge of pre-
serving the quaint, historical feel
of the downtown area,”

The Lexington Downtown De-
velopment Association is charged
with supporting and maintaining
the vitality of the area.

Don Hasfurther was the direc-

tor of the group, but last spring he

resigned to take another job. The
LDDA has nobody staffing their
ofﬁce right now, but the associa-
tion is supposed to be interview-
ing candidates for the director’s
position.

Lydia Pannell, owner of Fun
Foods & Accessories and some-
one who has been mentioned as a
possible candidate for the LDDA’s
top position, provided information
about the group’s Main Street pro-
gram.

Sterner gives different inﬂuence

Speaker driven to warn of the effects of driving under the influence after spring break disaster

By Sarah Kientz
RE PORTER

The lights in the Lenfest Audi-
torium dim and a ﬁgure takes the
stage.

He’s young and wearing laid-
back clothing, not dissimilar from
the outﬁts of the audience mem-
bers.

Instead of delving into a long-
winded speech, one that many au-
dience members may have ex-
pected, he begins by asking a few
simple questions.

“How many people in the room
have ever done something stupid
when they were drunk?”

Nearly every hand rises. As the
questions continue, fewer and
fewer people raise their hands.

“How many have woken up
and thought, “where am I?”

“How many have gone on
Spring Break with their friends?

“How many have driven with
a drunk driver? How many have
gone on Spring Break, drove
drunk, and killed three of their
best friends?”

At this ﬁnal question, only the
speaker, Mark Sterner, raises his
hand.

Sterner’s presentation, titled
“DUI: A Powerful Lesson”, was
intended to raise awareness and
warn students of the consequences
of drinking and driving.

The speech proved effective in
reaching the W&L audience as
students could relate to Sterner as
an individual.

Karlyn Gold, president of the
Panhellenic Council, worked to
bring Sterner to W&L.

Gold heard Mark Sterner’s

story at a national Greek confer- ‘

ence in Chicago last February, and
said, “his presentation was so bru-
tally real and evocative that we de-
cided students needed to hear it.

“Rather than just telling you to
not drink and drive, Stemer’s pre-
sentation illustrates the actual pain
and suffering that resulted from
his choosing to di*ive after drink-
ing,” Gold said.

The presentation opened with
a home video Sterner made dur-
ing a Spring Break trip he and four

“...his presentation was so brutally real

and evocative that we decided students

needed to hear it.”

- Senior KARLYN GOLD, President of the Panhellenic Council
 

of his fraternity brothers took to
Sanibel, Florida, their senior year.

Sterner told the audience he
made the video so he and his
friends could look back and laugh.

“I’ll never sit down and watch
this tape with my friends and
laugh,” Sterner said, “because 15
minutes after we made this my
three best friends died.”

Jan Kaufman, Director of
Health Promotion, said that

_ Stemer’s presentation was an im-

portant one for W&L students to
hear.

Despite Traveller’s safety and
popularity on campus, Kaufman
said drinking and driving is still
an issue.

“I’ve looked at core data from
last year and we know that 25%
of our students have driven under

the influence,” Kaufman said.
“We feel that we’d like to do bet-
ter than that.”

Kaufman said Traveller gives
students no excuse to drink and
drive.

“Traveller being on campus
and one of the strongest safe ride
programs in the country, there’s no
reason why students should be
driving under the influence,”
Kaufman said.

“We want students to know the
impact of driving under the inﬂu-
ence and its consequences.”

Katelyn Giarratana, Travel1er’s
Committee Chair, agreed that al-
though students do take advantage
of Traveller, there is still an incli-
nation for older students to drink
and drive.

“A majority of upperclassmen

live off campus and are spread out
within a few miles,” Giarratana
said.

“There’s always the temptation
to drink and drive. Traveller gives
students no excuse to, but it’s an
issue on every college campus.”

As well as being an problem
on campus, drinking is a large is-
sue when students go on vacation
as well.

Like many college students,
Sterner and his friends were de-
termined to have an unforgettable
Spring Break.

“We were going to get out of
hand,” Sterner said. “We were
going to show Sanibel anight that
wouldn’t be soon forgotten. We
didn’t realize how true that turned
out to be.”

Students will be able to appre-
ciate Sterner’s message,
Giarratana said, because of his
similarity W&L students.

“I hope students take away
how relevant [the problem] is to
our community,” Giarratana said.

Staying up .
for St. Jude’s;

Students show they care by raising funds for childhood cancer

By Abri Nelson
REPORTER

At St. Jude Children’s Re-
search Hospital in Memphis, TN
it is not uncommon to see children
playing on one of the indoor play-
grounds or laughing as they run
through the painted hallways of
the facility. Only these children
are different from most of their
peers — they all have some form
of cancer.

St. Jude, founded by late actor
Danny Thomas, opened its doors
in 1962 to any child suffering from
childhood cancer, at no cost to
their family whatsoever.

In fact, St. Jude feels more like
a hotel than a hospital, according
to sophomore Erin Vaughn, who
visited the facility over the sum-
mer along with junior Amanda
Dysart and senior Christine Gray.

In addition to the patients that
come to the hospital every day,
about 60 patients live at the hos-
pital with their families. Vaughn
said that most of the children do
not even realize that they have a
disease. They are too busy play-
ing and having fun to care about
chemotherapy or their regular vis-
its to the doctors at the facility.

The hospital is also a research
center, dedicated to ﬁnding cures
for various types of cancer and
sharing their research with doctors

around the world. The hospital
costs approximately $1 million a
day to run the various programs,
and that money comes solely from
donations. _

Up ‘Til Dawn is a series of
fundraisers centered on a letter
writing campaign to raise money
to support the medical care and
research at St. Jude. Dysart, the
president of W&L’s chapter of Up
‘Til Dawn, first heard about the
program from a friend at Vifrlliam
and Mary last spring. She became
so excited about the prospect of a
similar program here that she con-
tacted St. Jude to see if that was
possible.

According to Dysart, St. Jude
has wanted to start the program at
W&L for years because of our
close—knit community. After hear-
ing that such a program would be
possible here, she took efforts to
put together an executive board
and begin planning for the fall.

Sophomore Kelly Harvey, the
co-publicity chair for the execu-
tive board, said that the focus of
the program is to form teams of
six that will raise money by send-
ing letters to friends and family
asking for donations.

In addition, the teams are free
to do whatever other kinds of
fundraising they can think of.
There will be an event in early
November for all of the teams to

I
write their letters, and then an all

night party in March culminating
the efforts of the year.

It is this event that gives the
club its name. Team members stay}
“up ‘til dawn” to symbolize the
many sleepless nights that parents
spend staying up with their chil-
dren. According to Harvey, how-
ever, “this event is about celebrat’-‘
ing life!”

Tentative plans for the event at
W&L include movies, bands,
food, and games. K

All the members of the execu-
tive board are very excited about
the program here at W&L, espe-
cially Vaughn. pt

She hopes that Up ‘Til Dawry
will be about more than just rais-
ing money for a hospital, but
rather a common cause that the
entire campus can rally around.

Any student at W&L can form!‘
a team with ﬁve other students.
Vaughn also hopes that student
organizations will choose to form
teams to raise money for the cause.

Registration will occur at th
Commons from October 3-7 and
will include a $10 registration fee
known as a “Wig Fee” because it
goes to buying a wig for a child a)‘
the hospital.

Contact the Team Chairs,
Allison Stokan and Christine
Gray, in order to receive a regis-
tration form. A

[Vaughn] hopes- that Up ‘Til Dawn will be about more

than just raising money for a hospital, but rather a common

cause that the entire campus can rally around.

Pannell said, “the program has
a four point approach: Organiza-
tion, Design, Promotion, and Eco-
nomic Development.”

A business must apply and be
accepted to the program, in which
Lexington has been involved since
the early 1980s.

“The first few years were fo-
cused on re-vitalizing downtown
and improving the look of the
area,” Pannell added. For ex-
ample, all of the utility lines are
now buried underground.

In recent years the LDDA has
transitioned and is now working
on getting more people both 10-
cally and outside the area to shop
downtown.”

Panriell said, “Everyone says
that they love our downtown, but
their compliments aren’t very
helpful if they take their shopping
dollars to Charlottesville,
Staunton, or Roanoke.”

Along with the current leader-
ship void at the LDDA, there are
also concerns about high gas
prices hurting tourism in the area.

“Gas prices are a huge concern
for us,” Moore reported. “60-70%
of our business comes through
here between September 1*‘ and
January 1*‘, so we could be in un-

fall.

Lexington business can always
depend on revenue from W&L and
VMI, especially during Home-
coming and Parents’ weekend.

“It’ll be interesting to see how
our peripheral revenue — the
money from casual tourists — is af-
fected by the gas prices,” Moore
said.

“It could be a very interesting
fall.”

Every merchant interviewed
stressed the importance of the two
schools to Lexington.

“It’s a symbiotic relationship,”
Dan Vance said. “You need us;
we need you. The relationship
might ebb and ﬂow a bit, but both
groups still need each other.”

Julie Lindsey said, “Lexington
is different from the rest of the
country; we don’t have a big in-
dustry that employs most of the
town. Lots of people work for the
schools, and those jobs aren’t go-
ing anywhere.”

Though shops come and go,
though the school uses its ever-
fancier bookstore to keep student
dollars on campus, and though gas
prices cloud the economic future
with uncertainty, Lexington’s
downtown businesses are assur-
edly alive and well.

us to see a situation that’s very real
to us and gives us real—life conse-
quences as opposed to hearing
about a something that happened
to a friend of a friend.”

Sterner stressed the same issue
in his speech, noting that most
young people believe nothing bad
ever happens to them, and he be-
lieved it, too.

“I was only 21 years old. Old
people die. You’re not supposed
to die when you’re 21 . . .This kind
of stuff didn’t happen to me. It
happened to other people,” Sterner
said.

He suggested that perhaps stu-
dents may still believe they would
not end up in the same situation.
“Maybe you’re cooler, smarter,
luckier than [I was]. But maybe
you’re not.”

Gold said Stemer’s message
was particularly important for un-
derclassmen to hear so that per-
haps W&L can see changes in the
future.

“[Stemer’s speech is] directed
to all students, but I think it’s par-
ticularly important to get to the
freshmen and sophomores who
still live on campus,” Gold said.

“Then, when many of them live
off campus, they’ll hopefully al-
ways think about Stemer’s story

won’t have to bury one of your
friends or your parents won’t have
to bury you.”

Sterner said that if his audi-
ences could take one piece of ad},
vice with them, it would be to ex-
amine their decisions.

“I’ve spoken to over a million
people and I’ll never know if any
of them listened,” Sterner said. A

“I just want them to realize that
life’s full of choices, and choices
have consequences, even little
ones. Sometimes don’t just think
about yourself.” -"

Gold.is hopeful Stemer’s mes-
sage will reach students and make
a difference.

“If even one person acts dif-
ferently after seeing Sterner talk,"
then it’s been an effective pro-
gram,” Gold said. “And I’m con-
fident that that will happen.”

The lights rise in the Lenfe ,
Center, revealing a chattering au-
dience once Stemer’s speech has
concluded. There is the feeling of
eerie stiffness in the wake of the
powerful words that just ﬁlled th/H
room.

Though some students speak
of going to parties that night, an
extra note of caution resonates in
their voices as they leave the
room.

Intramural sports and com-
petitions are back and better
than ever. Thanks to a com-
plete overhaul of the system
by Campus Recreation Coor-
dinator Will Patterson, IM
competitors at W&L now have
a brand new website, new

equipment, double the amount .

of sports/competitions to do
battle in and a new ultimate
goal to strive for ~ the IM cup.

This year, the intramural
program at W&L has ex-

- pended to an unheard of 24
different competitions from

the expected soccer and ﬂag
football leagues to EA Sports
NCAA 2006, Texas Hold‘em

‘ and dodgeball. Six of the com-

petitions are leagues (both
men’s and women’s) and the
other sixteen are tournaments
or special events.

One of the biggest and
probably most exciting
changes to the IM program
this year is the IM Cup. The
IM Cup, based on similar
competitions in nearby col-
leges, is a year~long competi-
tion spanning the entire IM
repertoire. A team registered
for the IM Cup competes in
many, if not all, of the 24 IM
competitions and the top ten
finishers in the competitions
are awarded points (more
points are allocated to top fin-
ishers in major leagues). At
the end of the year, the team

 with the most points wins the»
” IM Cupiand gets t'c’>'liojl‘d on to “
it until anotherwinner is de-

terrnined. S This year,‘ most of

the IM Cup teams are frater-
nities and sororities but
Patterson hopes that once
word of the competition
spreads, there will be many
more independent teams. Play-

ers without teams can easily ’

form one of their own or join
the free agent list, allowing
teams that need players to eas-
ily ﬁnd them.

Another change that should
make intramural sports more
enjoyable is the launching of
the intramural website (http:/1'
cms.wlu.edu/intramurals/
defaultasp). The website has
all the information someone
interested in IM sports would
need. It features a list of IM
competitions and a registration
schedule, all the forms play-
ers (and IM teams) need to ﬁll
out to compete or to become
free agents. The website fea-
tures all the rules and regula-
tions players must follow in
the individual competition as
well as the IM Cup and the
standings in the current com-
petition.

A quick check of the
website, for example, will an-
swer a question that was fre-
quently asked this year,
whether varsity athletes can
compete in IM sports. The an-
swer is that they can, but not
in the sport that they play var-
sity.

The transformation of the
intramural league is completed
by the purchase of new equip-
ment and the hiring and train-

-ing~of»new officials. Every ef-

'f0'I’2t'h‘<'1S been made to‘make
surethe future of intramural
sports at W&L is a bright one.

Division Picks by Amanda Tholke and Neil Sheaffer
Superbowl Picks by Amanda Tholke, Neil Sheaffer and Jacob Geiger

It’s that time of year again, when every person under the sun thinks they’re an expert on the
NFL. While we are making our picks two weeks in to the season, it’s still just as difficult to predict
how each division will finish. We here at the Phi decided to take our chances and predict how the rest
of the upcoming NFL season will go, knowing that we are probably wrong in at least half of our picks.
Don’t judge us too harshly by our picks as we spent maybe a whole ten minutes thinking these things

through. Thank god football season’s finally here.

In the NFC, the South looks to be the strong division although the Redskins and Cowboys are making
the East rather interesting. Who would’ve thought that the lousy Redskins would’ve started out 2-0?
The NFC North is ridiculously weaker than everyone would have thought and, despite their crushing of
Detroit last week, I still think Chicago will finish last. The West is again the weakest division by far in
the NFC and probably in the whole NFL. It’s so sad that I can’t stand to watch any of those teams in

that division play.

sentiment now that they’re undefeated and because they completely dominated Minnesota last week
but I was at that game and I am a die-hard Bengals fan and have been believing this all year. This is the
year that the Bengals go to the playoffs after a 15-year drought. I think they will be Pittsburgh’s
toughest competition in the AFC this year. While the Chargers will slip a little from last year since
they’re still starting Brees when they have a 1*‘ round draft pick on the bench (somebody hasn’t been
watching the Bengals), the Colts and Patriots should still dominate their divisions. I think that the
Dolphins aren’t nearly as good as they looked in Week 1 against Denver and that they just got pumped

up for the home opener with a new coach.

A grey day for the Generals 

By Neil Sheaffer
STAFF WRITER

Under cloudy skies, members
of the Washington and Lee com-
munity, both past and present,
gathered at Wilson Field on Sat-
urday afternoon for a match-up
between the Generals (2-1) and
the Colonels (4-0) of Centre
College.

Fans from both sides were
treated to an exciting game, but
unfortunately for Generals fans,
Centre came away on top with a
35-26 victory.

Centre struck first in the first
quarter with a blocked punt re-
turned for a touchdown. The
Colonels were then able to up
the score to 14-0 with a 31 yard
touchdown pass with just a few
minutes left in the first half.

The Generals were not ready
to go to the locker room just yet
though and with 9.8 seconds left
in the ﬁrst half, senior quarter-
back Greg Tweardy connected
with junior tight end Ryan Neff
for a 16 yard touchdown, which
cut the deﬁcit in half.

The Colonels came out in the
third quarter and were able to in-
crease their lead to 21-7 on an
eight yard run by quarterback
Kevin Phelps.

The Generals were able to re-
spond two plays later when
Tweardy hit sophomore wide re-
ceiver Jack Martin for a 68 yard
touchdown reception.

.The Generals were never able
to catch up to the Colonels, who

followed up Martin’s big recep-
tion with a touchdown pass of
their own.

Stuart Sitterson, a freshman
defensive back, returned the en-
suing kickoff 79 yards for a
score, but the Generals were un-
able to shut down the Colonels
on the other side of the ball.
Centre struck once again at the
beginning of the fourth quarter

with a short touchdown run.
Martin caught a second touch-
down pass from Tweardy with
only three minutes remaining in
the game, but the two point con-
version failed, as did the ensuing
onsides kick attempt. Centre
ended this hard fought game
with the ball as they ran out the
clock for the win.

The Generals’ defense had a

difficult time stopping the C010-
nels, who were able to put 415
total yards on the board. Of
those 417 yards, 260 of them
were gained on the ground
against a very stingy Washington
and Lee defense, which was
ranked second in the country
against the run last year. Mark
Snoddy, a sophomore starter at
comerback, said, “They were

big, fast, really disciplined and
just outmanned us. We also
need to wrap up better.”

In regards to his defense’s in-
ability to stop the run, Washing-
ton and Lee head coach Frank
Miriello said, “You can’t win
games if you can’t stop the run
or run the ball.” The Generals
were able to gain 105 yards
rushing, but this was not enough

L

to beat the Colonels.
Unfortunately, the defense \
wasn’t the only thing that was

not completely on track today. V;

Though the offense racked up

415 yards of total offense, three
chances within the ten yard line
were squandered and no points

were scored on those drives. I’

“You have to put your chin
down and pound the ball when
that close to the goal,” Coach
Miriello replied when asked
about those situations.

The whole game was not
negative for the Generals
though. Quarterback Greg
Tweardy completed 24 of 38
passes for three touchdowns and
only one interception. Receiver
Jack Martin was exceptional,
catching 11 of Tweardy’s 24 re-
ceptions while gaining 206 yards ;
on those plays.

On the defensive side of the
ball, sophomore defensive back
Kyle Luby was the paced the de-
fense with ll tackles and Robert “ix
Foster and Ryan Hoover each
contributed a sack. Sophomore
comerback Kyle Harvey was
complimentary of the Generals’
effort and the Colonels as well.
He said, “Overall it was a great
effort, but we had some prob-
lems on the edge. Also, their
quarterback was a real good ath-
lete.”

Next week, the Generals
travel to Randolph-Macon to
take on the Yellow Jackets.
Kickoff is at 1:00 pm.

THE RING-TUM PHI 0

Big aspirations dominate W&L

Cheerleading as they move

towards true competition

Cheer ajfjiling at W&L has
changed in B signiﬁcant way
since Jessica Taylor, a 2004
graduate, helped pioneer the
school’s first cheerleading team in
2001

“n Taylor started, she recalled
ng just to maintain a team, often re-
sorting to begging friends and classmates to
try out for the squad.

Today, Taylor ﬁnds herself as Head
Cheerleading Coach and recruiting athletes is
her least concern. “More and more people try
out every year,” said Taylor.

This year, in addition to cheering for W&L
teams, Coach Taylor hopes to compete as a
squad.

“Football and basketball cheerleading is fun
and supporting W&L athletics is our priority,”
said Taylor. “But I would like to see us compete
as a team this year as well.”

In order to create a large enough team, the
Generals plan to unite forces with neighbor, Vir-
ginia Military Institute’s new squad for team
competitions.

“We’re actually trying to become a real
competitive team,” said Taylor.

VMI will add 2 men and 5 women to
Washington and Lee’s 10 member squad.

Because the NCAA does not recognize
cheerleading as a competitive varsity
sport, the Generals will not be able to
compete in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference.

Instead, they will compete in
leagues developed speciﬁcally for
cheerleading, the National
Cheerleading Association (NCA) or
University Cheer Association
(UCA).

“We’ve had to
have some additional
practices to get ready to

compete,” said Taylor.

The competitions in-

clude two- to ﬁve- minute

shows that involve cheering,
stunts, and dancing.
“We’ve been a lot more struc-
tured this year than last year,” said
junior Captain Bree Melton of the
change.
To prepare for the addition of com-
petitive cheerleading, the team hired a
professional instructor during the preseason.
“We started with a lot of new people,”
said Melton. “But they are strong people, we
have a strong coach, and after the camp we’ve
become united as a team.”

Sophomore Nikki Conkling is one of ﬁve
of the new members on W&L’s squad. Though
she has had some experience in tumbling and

dancing, cheerleading is something completely
new. '
“I was really scared at first when I was getting
thrown around,” said Conkling, one of the team
ﬂyers. '
“But I learned to trust my team during camp and
I’ve learned a whole lot and we have been working
really hard as a team.”
Coach Taylor is proud of the progress made but
she’s not ready to settle.
“I would like to see the team progress so that
by the time some of the freshman are seniors,
we can really be recognized as a competitive
team.”
The team hopes that with each year of im-

provement, they will be able to encourage

more fans to come to football and basket-

ball games. “We’re looking for school
spirit,” said Taylor. “And when there are
more fans, we’re a better team.”

  Steer clear

Mark Sterner warns students of the dangers of driving drunk

By Mallory Ruymann
STAFF WRITER

Like most kids here at W&L,
I have gone out a couple of
times. I have had a good time
on several occasions. I’ve even
made some bad decisions.

Most people, however, think
of these episodes as a normal
part ofthe college ‘experience,’
which they can look back on and
laugh about with their friends

. and family.

But just imagine that all
those supposedly good times
abruptly stopped with one bad
night. '

Sure, all of us have heard the
same old ‘I drove drunk and got
in trouble, so don’t be like me’
line in mandatory high school
assemblies. Even though they
had an important message,
never really registered in your
mind and inﬂuenced your deci-
sions the next weekend.

You might have been a pas-
senger in a car with a drunk
driver, or perhaps drove while
drunk, and if you are reading
this you probably didn’t get into
a car accident or kill anyone.

Congratulations, you were
lucky.

Mark Sterner was one of the
unlucky individuals who just
happened to have gotten behind
the wheel drunk, and unlike you,

[His] time at college was mined by the dark

mark of murder: Every time he looks back...

he remembers that he killed three people.
 l

killed three of his best friends
just three months shy of gradu-
ating college.

He now has told his story to
nearly a million students in the
hopes that maybe someone will
listen to him and avoid the mis-
take he made.

As a freshman who has not
experienced much of college-
and who has never been in a

situation on the W&L campus.

where drinking and driving
were involved (thank you Trav-
e1ler)——-I cannot speak for the
whole university ‘in saying how
much of an impact Sterner’s pre-
sentation made.

Conversely, those in the
freshmen class who actually at-
tended the presentation will
agree that such a powerful story
at the beginning of four years,
in which alcohol will definitely
be involved will inﬂuence our
decisions.

W&L has been fabulous thus
far and I want it to stay fabu-
lous until I graduate.

Sterner’s time at college was
ruined by the dark mark of mur-

der. Every single time he looks
back at college, instead of re-
membering good times, friends,
and parties, he remembers that
he killed three people that were
part of all of his other memo-
ries. Even remembering the
little things will connect him
back to that one fateful night.

When I look back at W&L. I
do not want to recall the night
that I killed three of my best
friends. *

All I have to do is stay away
from drinking and driving. This
decision that is made easier be-
cause of the amazing services
of Traveller. Hopefully the
whole campus will do the same,
and from what I have seen, most
of you do.

So, continue to be one of the
lucky people who makes the
right decision. If you have been
drinking, don’t drive or get into
the car with anyone who has
been drinking.

Make decisions so that
when you are eighty and remi-
niscing about college, you have
nothing to regret.

Waves of her own

Senior legacy Kristine Holda makes her mark on the campus

For Kristine Holda, there is
nothing like the song
“Shenandoah” to make you re-
member just where and who you
are.

Holda first set foot on this
campus when she was just eleven.
Holda and her family were cel-
ebrating her father’s 20"‘ year col-
lege reunion. Ken Holda, a Ger-
man and European History major
graduated in 1976. Holda remem-
bers the first visit in crisp detail.

“I loved W&L,” she said. “At
the time, I lived in Chicago, and
it was a miserable spring. I came
out here and the dogwoods were
in bloom, it was warm, things
were green. It was marvelous.”

The Holdas attended a gather-
ing in Lee Chapel, where South-
ern Comfort and Jubilee ended by
singing the folk song. i

“We came out of the chapel and
looked up at the Colonnade,”
Holda remembers. “It was night
— there were stars and George was
lit up. My dad had tears in his eyes
after hearing ‘Shenandoah.’
That’s how I knew this was a spe-
cial place.”

Holda’s mother remembers
that her daughter announced to the
family, “Daddy, I’m gonna come
here.”

Then, Holda appeared as a
Summer Scholar in the summer of
2001. “I felt like a real college
kid,” said Holda, who participated
in the journalism track.

She applied early decision and

was ecstatic when she learned of
her acceptance. “It was the best
Christmas gift I received that
year,” she said.

She arrived on the same carn-
pus on Freshman Move-In Day
that her father had entered 30 years
before. The campus — and the gen-
der of half the student body — had
changed, but W&L was still her
father’s alma mater.

But for Holda, it felt different.
She had visited Lexington many

“I came here and the
dogwoods were in
bloom, it was warm,
things were green. It

was marvelous.”

times and knew people in town,
but she still had the freshman jit-
ters. “When I was a summer
scholar, I knew that if I didn’t like
it, I’d be home in a month,” she
"said. “But this was the real
thing.”

After four years, Holda has
made a place for herself on the
campus with participation in
classes and extra-curricular activi-
ties. And, frequently, that place
is the Cy Twombly Pool.

Holda has swurn all four years
for the Generals, and this year is
co-captain of the women’s team.

Holda holds several school
records with her teammates in the
medley relays.

Swimming is a love for Holda,
who said, “Swimmers are kind of
their own breed. The sport gar-
ners a lot of respect because it is
so intense.”

Swimming, along with being a
sport and hobby, is also a summer
job. Holda spends her Ohio sum-
mers as a lifeguard and swim
teacher in her hometown of
Strongsville.

“As an independent, the swim
team is my sorority,” she always
quips. “I absolutely love those
girls.”

In the spring, Holda will gradu-
ate with a BA. in Biology. She
will then make her waves across
the Atlantic Ocean as she spends
a year abroad in a little — and little-
known — country of Estonia. This
Baltic state holds much signifi-
cance for her. Holda is a second
generation Estonian-American.
She will spend a year at an Esto-
nian university learning the lan-
guage and culture, and as she said,
“immersing myself in my heri-
tage.”

It is an added challenge for all
legacy students here at W&L to
step out of their parents’ shadow
on a campus that often has its gaze
in the past. Holda has taken this
“special place” she discovered
from her father and, as
“Shenandoah” lyrics say, made it
her own “rollin’ river.”

eekend’s homecoming
is were kicked off by a
known but extremely
ted band hailing from
cago, Umphrey’s McGee.
mphrey’s, named the suc-

/S on keyboards, Kris Myers on

drums, and Andy Farag on
secondary percussion.

Umphrey’s played a wide
variety of music, with covers
ranging from Bob Marley’s
“Trenchtown Rock” to a hi-
larious rendition of Biz
Markee’s “Just a Friend”
sung by Ryan Stasik.
Umphrey’s played a mix of
songs off their recent and
critically acclaimed album
Anchor Drops, in addition to
some classics off their older
albums.

Umphrey’s fanatic junior
Joe Green says, “Everyone
who didn’t go to the show
missed out on a great oppor-
tunity. Umphrey’s McGee
will never play this small of a
show again. In two years,
they will be bigger than
Phish. It’s such a treat to be
able to have them come to
W&L.”

Junior Andrew Gulotta

echoed these sentiments,
“this band is at the pinnacle
of musical talent; it’s too bad
they aren’t more well-
known.”

Even people who hadn’t
heard of the band before had
positive reactions. Freshman
Addison Sanford exclaims,
“They were scintillating and
stomp-tacularl Their unique
blend of diverse musical
styles creates a delightful
romp suitable for women and
children alike!”

Umphrey’s McGee is able
to play such a range of styles
because of the diverse musi-
cal backgrounds of all its

, members.

While Umphrey’s plays
mainly rock—based music, lis-
teners get a hint of their
country inﬂuences on Anchor
Drop’s “Bullhead City.”

Guitarist Brendan Bayliss
said he is working with Jeff
Austin of acclaimed blue-
grass band Yonder Mountain
String Band on an acoustic
album “about the trials and
tribulations of life.’’

Bayliss isn’t the only one
channeling some of his en-
ergy into side projects.

Guitarist Jake Cinnger re-
cently released an album with
his old band, Ali Baba’s
Tahini.

Cinniger, inﬂuenced
heavily by Mark Knopﬂer
and his early Dire Straits
work, has brought a distinct

sound to the band since his
induction in 2000.

“I’m a drummer by trade,”
he says, “but my goal is to
play every instrument well.”
He’s already well on his way
to reaching that goal, playing
guitar, bass, violin, banjo,
mandolin, and many other in-
struments. While Umphrey’s
is classiﬁed as a “jam band,”

Cinniger is critical of the
genre. “The problem with
jam bands is that they get
into a good groove, but they
can’t break out of that box;
they’re afraid to stretch it
out. You gotta stretch it out to
keep it interesting.”

Umphrey’s McGee does
just that. The band has a very
unique form of jamming. In-
stead of laying out a chord
progression and improvising
within it, Umphrey’s has
hand signals for a variety of
tricks to pull on stage. They
have signals for each key, in
addition to signals for modu-
lating in various degrees and
returning to previous sections
of a jam.

This way, Umphrey’s en-
sures that every show is
unique and interesting. Be-
cause of the originality of
their jams, some material
from live Umphrey’s shows
actually makes it onto their
studio albums. Anchor
Drop’s “In the Kitchen,”
named Song of the Year at
the J ammy’s award festival,

was inspired by live perfor-
mances.

,, Despite the recent release
of Anchor Drops, fans can
expect a new Umphrey’s al-
bum to be hitting shelves
within the next few months.
The band has been debuting
a plethora of new material
that should find its way onto
a record sometime soon.

The band has also recently
produced a new DVD,
Wrapped Around Chicago,
which will be released on
October 16. Bayliss says the
new disc should be even bet-
ter than 2002’s Live from the
Lake Coast Skyline Stage.

Bayliss is confident that
college radio will continue to
help with band recognition.

“You pull into a town like
Lexington, and you’re getting
free advertising. It creates a
buzz on campus; usually
people like to listen to things
that they’re recommended to,
not what they’re told, and
college radio does that. It’s a
legitimate voice because it’s
not corporate.”

Tune into 91.5 WLUR on
Thursday from 5-7 PM and
Friday from 12-2 AM for a
sampling of Umphrey’s
tunes. .

If they come to your
hometown this summer, don’t
hesitate to buy tickets, be-
cause it won’t be long before
they are going to be the hot-
test ticket around.

Caley Anderson and Justin McKeen sound oﬁ’ on both sides of the moon mission argument

SHEER LUNACY

By Caley Anderson
STAFF COLUMNIST

President Bush seems bent on
increasing spending while simul-
taneously decreasing revenue.
The present administration has
laid out its $100 billion plus plan
to return Americans to the moon.

Put simply, the nation has bet-
ter problems to deal with than a
return to the moon. Our national
resources are strained. We are en-
gaged in a protracted foreign war
and already costing billions. We
have just witnessed the practical
destruction of New Orleans.

Why? NASA’s administrators
maintain that investment in con-
tinued manned lunar landings is a
long-terrn investment; much like
a European investment in the New
World circa 1492.

They say that it will be well
worth the cost in thelong run.
They say that if we do not get our
exploration and researching now,
other countries will beat us to the
punch of moon colonization.

What is bad about this mission
is the timing- last I checked,
China’s moon mission is going to
be basic and exploratory, much
like the Apollo missions of the
1960s.

China, in other words, is not
going to be calling first dibs on
the moon unless we get there first.
We can debate all we want

whether the administration is sim-
ply throwing out the moon mis-
sion as a way to distract Ameri-
cans from other problems, but the
fact is that China will get there
first whether we start now or not-
we’d be ready to go in 2018, and
China, by even the most conser-
vative account, probably won’t
delay their program past 2012.

And as in the Cold War, we
should be wary of a “get there
first” mentality— national security
is NOT a serious factor in support
of a space program.

We should worry first about
how to preserve national security
planet side.

The very first mission to reach
the moon (though not land on it)
was Apollo 1.

Apollo 1 never got off the

ground- during a test run through»

launch procedures, the entire com-
mand capsule assembly was en-
gulfed in ﬂames, burning to death
all three of the astronauts inside.
Ominous precedent indeed for
NASA given their recent troubles.

Should we eliminate space pro-
gram funding altogether? N 0. We
should maintain an investment in
the future that space exploration
represents. Should we abandon all
hope of returning to the moon?

No, we should just wait until a’

more opportune time. The condi-
tions, at present, do not justify
another moon mission.

BEAM ME UP

By Justin McKeen
STAFF COLUMNIST

When Neal Armstrong took
mankind’s first steps on the moon
in 1969, it was a momentous oc-
casion, for the world and espe-
cially for America. Early this
week, NASA unveiled an ambi-
tious plan for the next 13 years.
Making good on the words of
President Bush in 2004, NASA
says it will put astronauts on the
moon in 2018; the first time men
will have visited the moon since
the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.

Immediate concerns have
sprung up around the proposed
plan. In the wake of devastating
natural disasters and skyrocketing
costs in Afghanistan and Iraq,
some Congressmen and pundits
are claiming the space program is
a waste of money—money that
could be better spent elsewhere.
They couldn’t be more wrong.

Like 1969, American today
faces an uncertain world where
danger seems omnipresent. Also
like 1969, our society is divided
over important issues, both at
home and abroad, to the point that
civil discourse seems to have bro-
ken down, and we are reduced to
a state of partisan bickering and
finger-pointing.

As sad as it is to say, it seems
unlikely that these rifts are going
to heal anytime soon. No matter

how many support-our-troops
bumper stickers are out there, con-
tention over the war in Iraq will
continue. Arguments over welfare
and gay marriage will continue.
But in the midst of all these frac-
tious issues, we have a chance to
come together as a country and
achieve something that, for the
greatest course of human history,
was an unthinkable dream.

The cost of the plan is 104 bil-
lion dollars, but spaced over thir-
teen years, it falls within NASA’s
l6—billion a year budget. The sci-
entiﬁc beneﬁts are more question-
able (NASA hopes to ascertain
whether or not ice exists on the
moons south pole), but many of
the technologies that we take for
granted today are an outgrowth of
past space—related research.

It is important that help reach
those devastated by hurricane
Katrina. It is important that the
troops in Iraq and Afghanistan re-
ceive the equipment and support
they need. But it is also important
that America continue to lead the
way in exploring space and hu-
manities place in it. We can ac-
complish that goal without weak-
ening our response to tragedy,
without abandoning prior commit-
ments, and what’s more we can
instill in ourselves a sense of ca-
maraderie and accomplishment
that is sadly lacking in our society
today.

‘Hispanic’ not sufﬁcient

Label creates confusion and a too-large, non-diverse category for a wide array of people

By Alejandro Selin
GUEST COLUMNIST

The September 15”‘ edition of
Campus Notices marked the be-
ginning of a series of messages
announcing Hispanic Heritage
Month.

The notice was accompanied
by a few words from Linda
Alvarado, owner of the Colorado
Rockies franchise: “Whether
we’re called Hispanos or
Mexicanos or Puertorriquefios,
Cubanos, or Latinos, we are a fam-
ily connected to a community of
very talented people from very
different backgrounds who are
doing amazing things that our par-
ents did not have the opportunity
to do.”

Now, what exactly does it mean
to be family “from very different
backgrounds”?

To the American mind His-
panic is a race, on par with White,
Black, American Indian and East
Asian. American institutions cer-
tainly do their part to perpetuate
this conception, as the many forms
which list Hispanic as a distinct
race or ethnicity testify.

In truth Hispanic, as the word
is regularly used today, encom-
passes people of all races.

Examples of some famous
people considered Hispanics will
suffice to prove this.

Cameron Diaz is a Cuban-
American actress of European an-

cestry.
Baseball star Sammy Sosa,

word to the book The Future Is

Four people——-of four different
races, ‘from very different back-
grounds’——arc all part of the same
family? They are all—Hispanics?

It would seem foolish to
Americans to label themselves as
Britannic, including in the word’s
deﬁnition Canadians, Nigerians,
East Indians and people of every
other English—speaking country in

the world.

Why would one want to call
oneself a Britannic if the term had
such a wide and nebulous appli-
cation? Should European-Ameri-
cans have to choose between
White and Britannic on a form?

Or should African-Americans
lose their identity and be grouped
with Whites as Britannics, be-
cause they are from an English-
speaking country?

The idea is ridiculous, of
course, but it is no different to the
idea behind popular usage of the
word Hispanic. For, just like those
from English-speaking countries,
people from Spanish-speaking
countries are of different racial
families. Hispanic, quite simply,
will not do.

THE RING-TUM PHI ' 9

4 013 your normal Facing Off
, college football spirit

Sundresses somewhat lackluster when it comes to pigskin pride

By Carissa Shipley

STAFF COLUMNIST

Tonight, my friends and family from
home are heading to a Friday night lights
football game. If I were still in high
school, I would have gone to school to-
day decked out in blue and gold.

And I mean decked out. My best
friend and I dressed as twins in blue ath-
letic pants with gold stripes down the
side, blue or yellow Rampart High
School t-shirts and blue and gold rib-
bon halos.

Our nails were painted blue and gold
and I wouldn’t let my parents buy me
any tennis shoes that didn’t have some
kind of blue speciﬁcally for the days of
home football games.

While you might be thinking other-
wise, no one actually thought I was a
nerd as I ran from class to class, the
colored ribbons streaming out behind
me. They didn’t even think I was a nerd
as Itopped the whole ensemble with my
letter jacket or painted my face.

This was because everyone else was
dressed the same way. The kid who wore__
a Rampart t-shirt with his jeans was the
big loser. Where was his spirit anyway?

Fast forward to college.

I was ready to meet the Greeks on
one of my ﬁrst weekends here and I got
ready in my tailgate clothes. I ﬁgured
the sweatpants might be. a little much
and put on jeans with a t-shirt from the
first load of W&L clothes I purchased.

I was on my way out the door when
the RA stopped me, gently explaining
what it’s like here.

Turns out that what it’s like here is
actually minimal school spirit, rarely
shown, and certainly not appropriate for
football games (besides the occasional
cheer from the less-than-packed sta-
dium).

I ﬁnd this extremely strange consid-
ering that there is a community kind of
feeling.

As I surf facebook, 1 see that people
have friends from various frats and srats
and while everybody doesn’t always

Feeling fratty enough, Ben Kapur combined Generals formal fratwear and traditional
football paint for a true-blue pigskin look on Saturday's homecoming game.

_ love everyone else, I think we all get

along fairly well.

So why don’t we celebrate the insti-
tution that brought us all together, where
we live and work and play?

I blame the atmosphere. Who wants
to feel obligated to look their best in
roasting heat or freezing wind?

I am personally more likely to skip a
game I want to see when I know my skirt
will lead to purple legs and I can’t just
throw on my W&L sweatshirt.

Risky surgery improves quality of life

By Casidhe Horan
STAFF COLUMNIST

Matthew Teffeteller knows pain well.
Pain from having lost his wife to a ﬁre.
Pain from having his face severely burned
as he tried to save his wife. Pain from
having dozens of reconstructive surger-
ies on his face. Pain from the inﬂamma-
tion and staph infections caused by fes-
tering hairs of his old beard that is now
covered in a crust of skin grafts.

Mr. Teffeteller and others who have to
live with this kind of pain often undergo
numerous reconstructive surgeries in an
attempt to repair the face. Skin grafts
from a person’s back, legs, arms, or but-
tocks are used to create a patchwork of
grafts and scar tissue that do not look or
move like healthy skin. Often, dozens of
surgeries are required because only a little
bit of skin can be grafted at a time in or-
der to prevent severe Ueeding. Pain is a
given. Returning the patient’s appearance
to what it once was is too often out of the
question.

But now a new treatment has come to
the forefront of scientific and medical
controversies: the face transplant. The
process would first identify a deceased
skin donor matching the skin tissue, age,
race, and sex of the recipient. An inci-
sion would be made and the face would
be “degloved” from the cadaver, as the
skin with eyelids, lips, crucial blood ves-
sels, and nerves would be removed. The
damaged skin from the recipient would
also be removed. Surgeons would then
align the new face with the existing nose,
eyes, and cheekbones of the recipient,
giving shape to the ﬂap of skin. Blood
vessels and muscles would also be con-
nected. Post-surgery, anti-rejection drugs
would be taken for the rest of the patient’s
life.

Some leading transplant specialists
hope to perform the world’s first face
transplant by the end of this year.

Outrageous? Unbelievable?
Face transplantation reflects the closing
gap between the impossible and reality
thanks to science and technology. And
as that gap gets smaller and smaller, it is
imperative that we confront the complex
questions that need to be asked.

Scientifically, what makes a
face a face? A face is more than just a
piece of skin. A face is expressions.
Winking, smiling, crying and all the other
expressions that make us human are
linked to the brain; they are not embed-
ded in the skin .

Scientiﬁcally, at what point can we
declare doctors prepared and skilled
enough to perform such risky surgery?
Face transplantation seems like such an
unknown that it may seem as though we
should have more evidence or practice
before actually perfomiing the procedure
on a person. At the same time, there has
to be a first, and there has to be a risk
because no risk often means no gain.

What does face transplantation mean
for the donor? Should a skin donor be
automatically considered a face donor as
well? Donating skin from the arm seems
less emotional or complicated than donat-
ing a face. Perhaps there should be two
options: skin and/or face donors.

What does it mean for the recipient?
Identity crisis and emotional instability
are possible psychological consequences.
Will wearing someone else’s face have a
negative effect? On the other hand, per-
haps a new face will lead to a new lease
on life — a strengthened psychological
state.

And what about the family of the do-
nor? What will it be like for the family to
see their loved one’s face on a stranger?
Or vice versa, what will it be like for the
family of the recipient to see a stranger’s
face on their loved one? We don’t know
right now. Maybe it will be nothing.
Maybe it will hurt. Maybe it will be a
new emotion that we can’t understand
until it happens.

Ethically, The Royal College of
Surgeons in London and The French Na-
tional Ethics Advisory Committee have
already stated that the surgery should not
be done because of patient selection and
informed consent. The doctors interested
in performing the surgery insist they will
only select patients deemed psychologi-
cally ﬁt or strong. Ironically, it is pos-
sible those who are most interested in face
transplantation may be the least psycho-
logically stable.

The doctors also promise to use in-
formed consent. Informed consent is de-
ﬁned as the consent by a patient to a sur-
gical or medical procedure or participa-
tion in a clinical study after achieving and
understanding the relevant medical facts
and risks involved. Those in London and
France have argued that informed consent
is not possible because doctors are not
fully aware of what the consequences may
be, and so it is impossible for the patient
to be adequately informed.

Morally, can we justify the risks in a
non—life-or—death situation? On the ﬂip
side, can we deny someone in intense pain
potential relief? Is it moral to do this for
cosmetic reasons? How do we draw the
line between medical necessity and cos-
metic desire? We may need to set guide-
lines outlining what level of pain and suf-
fering justifies such treatment - but how
do we do that?

Finally, what does this mean to us as a
society? For instance, who’s going to pay
for this? Insurance? Another means?

Also, plastic surgery started as a medi-
cal practice to heal, but evolved into a
cosmetic industry. Looking down the
road ahead, does face transplantation have
that potential? Could we have people
switching faces? Shows- such as “The
Swan” could take on a whole new shock-
value.

Teffeteller and those in severe pain like
him deserve to have their pain eased. Face
transplantation has the potential power to
do this. It is also representative of the
trend of more and more amazing, yet in-
credibly complex, innovations, as well as
the accompanying dilemmas we face in
the future.

Face transplantation is, no doubt, a
tough issue. Today, we’ve not yet had to
deal with the transplantation of something
so closely tied to identity. And right now,
it seems to new and there is too much
unknown to deﬁnitely rule it in or out yet.

One thing is for sure, though: before
we proceed, we need to make sure we
know what we’re doing. We must ask the
right questions and answer them. And we
need to do this not just for face transplan-
tation, but for future innovations as well,
which are sure to be even more compli-
cated. The better we can tackle these
questions so that we have a clear under-
standing of the far-stretching conse-
quences, the better science and technol-
ogy can continue to improve our lives.

UPS 8: DOWNS

Opinions writer Caley Anderson
gives his take on the good, the
bad, and the ugly.

0 Hurricane Rita. You
have to be shaking your head
if you’re from the gulf coast
region right about now.

0 “Head Cases.” When a
show gets canceled after only
two airings on FOX, you
know it can’t be that good.

0 Lex Weather. Unusually
hot this week. That probably
means we can predict snow
for next week.

0 The Apprentice:
Martha Stewart. “The
reason this company has been
so successful is that we
connect each and every day,”
said Martha to her eager
contestants. Sometimes, we
EVEN connect with our
stockbrokers about secret
corporate information!

0 Iraq Doctrine. Bush
says that withdrawing from
Iraq now “Would make the
world more dangerous.” He’s
absolutely right. The
questionable decision is going
in there and destabilizing
things in the first place.
Nevertheless, we should
realize that leaving a void in
the Middle East now would
be disastrous. It’s too late for
the American public to back
off now- if you supported the
war in the beginning, you
ought to continue doing so.

0 Homecoming. Great
food and great friends. A little
overcast at the game but at
least your sundresses didn’t
get wet...

0 Ditching Your Date.
You either asked or got asked
to homecoming. That doesn’t
give you permission to bail.

Rape on t  e rise

Enclosed environment and Greek atmosphere create negative setting for sexual situations on campus

By Alexa Moutevelis
STAFF COLUMNIST

It’s the beginning of the third
full week of classes and chances
are that some girls reading this
have already been sexually as-
saulted.

For all you freshmen or anyone
else that doesn’t know this: Wash-
ington and Lee University has a
problem with sexual assault on
campus.

Last year a survey found that
our school has a higher rate of
sexual battery, attempted rape and
rape than the national average of
colleges participating in the sur-
vey. The numbers are as follows:

Sexual Battery (Sexual touch-
ing against their will): W&L -
22.6%, national average - 11.9%

Attempted Rape (Attempted
sexual penetration against their
will): W&L - 8.5%, national
— 3.9%

Rape (Sexual penetration

against their will): W&L - 2.6%,
national - 1.9%

For all these percentages, only
2 sexual assaults were officially
reported last year. This has to stop.

I think a major part of the prob-
lem with reporting and girls get-
ting help is the intense rumor mill
combined with the Greek atmo-
sphere. Let’s look at a hypotheti-
cal situation in which a freshman
girl is sexually assaulted. In such
a small school, someone would
find out and that someone would
tell others and it would spread;
probably including catty com-
ments about the girl’s behavior
and promiscuity. If the perpetra-
tor were a well known frat guy, the
frat would presumably rise up to
defend him along with their srat
friends. This can affect which
sorority she gets into and even if
she gets into one at all. It may be
so bad that she ends up having to
transfer. The girl has no chance
to defend herself and is, ﬁgura-

tively, assaulted again.

The same can happen if it is an
upperclassman woman, or the as-
sailant is a freshman guy. There
are definite social consequences,
although they may not be as ex-
trerne.

I believe this fear of being os-
tracized is what drives women to
keep their assault a secret. Un-
fortunately, keeping it a secret can
exacerbate the emotional and
spiritual problems that come with
sexual assault.

This is what concerns me the
most. I would like our campus to
get to a point where a sexual as-
sault victim can report without
getting blamed by society, but un-
til that time, we have to take care
of the women who need help but
are afraid to speak up.

Women: If you have been
sexually assaulted, please talk to
someone. There are numerous
organizations on campus as well
as local and state support groups.

You can be anonymous and you
don’t have to report who was in-
volved if you don’t want to. The
important thing is that you get
help.

If you have not been sexually
assaulted, please be sensitive to
those that have been. Don’t be so
quick to denounce girls as sluts;
you don’t know what really hap-
pened. Always watch out for your
friends and take care of yourself.

Men: Ifthe girl you have your
eye on is very drunk — steer clear.
She could be blacked out and
therefore unable to give consent
and that is sexual assault. Also, if
you want to hook up with a girl
and she’s not that interested, don’t
even think about giving her more
to drink so she’ll say yes. Don’t
get too drunk yourself so you
don’t know whether or not she’s
consenting.

You can also be supportive of
women that have been sexually
assaulted and ﬁnd out more infor-

mation from 1 in 4, an all-male
sexual assault peer education
group on campus.

region. Will the Palestinians ﬁ-
nally gain sovereignty in a peace-
ful way? Will the Israeli govem—
ment reassert power over Gaza
again in the near future? Or will
terrorist organizations such as
Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Is-
lamic Resistance Movement ruin
these positive developments?

My hope is that the first sce-
nario becomes a reality. I had the
fortune of living the Middle East
for two years, but each day sad
news about Israel and Palestine
filled the newspapers with little
hope in sight. Stories of carnage
and vivid photographs from both
perspectives filled the news. Now,
with some light at the end of the
tunnel, what has to be done to
maintain peace and order in the
region?

Mahmoud Abbas, the prime
minister of Palestine, finds the ball
in his court to respond to the re-
cent moves made by the Israeli
government. I believe that Abbas
can and will lead the Palestinian
people towards sovereignty. How-

ever, Abbas finds himself in a very
awkward spot. He leads a group
of passionate, proud people who
have lived in this land for thou-
sands of years, but have no coun-
try of their own. Abbas must ap-
peal to the United States and Is-
rael, who are the main obstacles
in his efforts to achieve the ulti-
mate goal of Palestinian sover-
eignty. Can Abbas hold the trust
of his people while working with
the perceived “enemies”? My
guess is that he will have to take
small, certain steps before he can
achieve any great success.

Most importantly, Abbas must
first make a concerted effort to
eliminate the inﬂuence that Pal-
estinian terrorist organizations
exert upon the people. I have al-
ways been a supporter of Pales-
tinian independence, but Abbas
must prove to the world that his
country will not be a source of glo-
bal terrorism. Abbas has the po-
tential to pull this off, though the
sheer magnitude of terrorist
groups will make it difficult.

Second, Abbas should go to the
United Nations (useless, but still
a good ﬁgurehead) and the United
States (or any other “major” coun-

try of his choice) and ask for me- .

diation between Israel and Pales-
tine. Normalized relations be-
tween Abbas and Ariel Sharon
would help their respective coun-
tries and the entire region. Mus-
lim countries like Qatar and Paki-
stan recently revitalized ties by
meeting with Israeli representa-
tives to discuss the Gaza with-
drawal. Pakistani president Pervez
Musharraf even shook hands and
exchanged pleasantries with
Sharon, an action unheard of in
recent history.

Like myself, President Bush
sees hope in the situation. The
president recently said in New
York, “The opportunity rests with
the Palestinian people to show
they can govern themselves in a
peaceful way.” I am happy to see
that Bush supports the idea of Pal-
estinian independence if the Pal-
estinians show a commitment to

peace. I hope he means what he
said because his relationships with
Israel and Palestine aren’t what
one could call level handed.

The light at the end of the tun-
nel grows brighter as each day
passes. I now go to news websites
any chance I get to see if there are
any new developments out of the
Middle East. I loved my time in
the Middle East and I hope that
many other people will be able to
experience the wealth of culture
that I enjoyed during my many
trips in the area. The stability of
the region hinges on the relation-
ship between Palestine and Israel
and, like the optimist I try to be, I
see hope for the near future.

Tulane,‘Taradlse,’ 

and tailgating  

Mourning the loss of the football game tailgate I ‘

By Hugh Trout
STAFF COLUMNlS“l'

Welcome back Generals
and an especially warm wel-
come goes out to the new
freshmen (I hear they drink a
lot of alcohol. . and Iknow it’s
true because I hear it from the
freshmen themselves at almost
every party . . . sweet). Also,
Tulane students get a shout out
and I look forward to having a
few drinks with you all
throughout the semester.

Let us recap the greatest
recent developments in the
global community. First off,
Tara Reid has her own reality
show called Taradise and it is
delicious. Thanks Tara from
every college aged guy in
America. This is a huge de-
velopment seeing how many
top Hollywood starlets are
turning less than desirable
(Brittany Spears, Lindsay
Lohan, pretty much everyone).

Second off, it would be
wrong to not even mention the
departure of our late President.
Most of my friends and stu-
dents in general will speak of
him as if he shot their dog, and
I too am certainly glad to see
him go. He simply wasn’t a
W&L kind of guy. My hope is
that the next President is a
W&L alumnus, but I’ ll keep an
open mind no matter what.

Alright, but now it’s down
to business...the real issue at
hand. What is this pressing is-
sue that we must devote our
attention to‘? Simple: tailgat-
ing. Speciﬁcally, how badly it
needs to come back in full
force to this campus. It’s a
college rite of passage: living
in a dorm room, studying hard,
meeting people, getting drunk
out of the back of a parked
SUV. In fact, one of my fa-
vorite events all year,
Foxfields, is really just a tail-

gate in a field for a sporting
event people are honest enough
to say they don’t even care
about. Our sports teams de-
serve to allow their fans to tail-
gate. Everyone knows that this
school’s speaking tradition is
at it’s best when everyone has
had a few drinks in them, and
so being against tailgating is
really just a thinly veiled way
of being against not only
W&L, but happiness, sunshine,
and to be honest, America.
And if we just give up tailgat-
ing then the evildoers win.
First tailgating, then What’s
next? Democracy? Laughter?
It’s just wrong.

Sure, technically you. can
tailgate before a game and then
go, but I’m talking about old
school W&L tailgating; real
tailgating. The whole school
hanging out together in the sun
and doing what W&L does
best. Don’t get me wrong,
watching games is fun in its
own right, but like most forms
of reading and mathematics, it
can be improved with some
good drinks and friends.

I know that many people i
believe that any new adrninis~ .

tration would never allow tail-
gating to come back, but I ‘m
optimistic. You may say I’m a
dreamer, but Pm not the only
one. Imagine all the.people,
drinking in a parking lot to-
gether. I will ﬁght for the glo-
rious invention John S. Tail-
gate gave us’ so many years ago,
and I hope you will too. If we
let them take this, who knows,
maybe they will go as far as to
mess with the Trident or even
try to rename the co-op. I know
that sounds like it could never
happen, but give them an inch,
and they’ll want to turn your
college into someplace as so-
cially uncomfortable as watch-
ing a Girls Gone Wild commer-
cial with your parents.

TEACHER FEATURE

These

Two new staff members add their flair and finesse to powerful positions

Jason Rodocker
“My long-term goal [is] to one day be
president at a small college like this.”

By Emily Peck
STAFF WRITER

W&L has a new director of
Student Activities and Greek Life
this year, Mr. Jason Rodocker.

Mr. Rodocker is originally
from Indianapolis, Indiana and
graduated from Hanover College
with a degree in Communications
and Business Management.

After graduating, Mr.
Rodocker worked for the gover-
nor of Indiana for one year and
then spent three years at_Indiana
University obtaining a law degree
and a Master’s of Higher Educa-
tion Administration.

When asked what brought him
to W&L, Mr. Rodocker re-
sponded, “It was really the per-
fect opportunity for me. My long
term goals are to one day be a
dean of students at a small col-
lege like this and to be president
of a small college like this.”

Mr. Rodocker said his job will
enable him to work towards those
aspirations.

Mr. Rodocker noted that one
of the great aspects of his posi-
tion as director is that it allows
him to oversee four key compo-
nents of campus life: student ac-
tivities, housing, judicial issues,
and Greek life.

When asked what a typical day
as director of his ofﬁce was like,
Mr. Rodocker answered that his

job was busier than some might
expect.

On any average day he re-
ceives 100-150 e-mails and
twenty phone calls. Mr. Rodocker
also spends a lot of time prepar-
ing for meetings, participating in
meetings, and meeting with stu-
dents.

Mr. Rodocker also remarked
that his dinner plans for the next
three weeks are set since he will
be eating chapter dinners with
various, fraternities and sororities
on campus and talking with house
directors.

Mr. Rodocker also commented
about his future plans for student
activities.

He said that students who re-
viewed the ofﬁce last year recom-
mended that instead of focusing
on a larger number of activities,
the ofﬁce should focus on mak-
ing a fewer number of activities
bigger and better.

Mr. Rodocker said that he will
strive to move his ofﬁce in that
direction this year.

Some of the activities coming
up in the next few weeks include
an X-Box game zone on two,
twelve-foot Television screens
this Wednesday and a game of
lazer tag on the Canaan Green on
October 19.

Mr. Rodocker is glad to be at
W&L and says that he loves his
job.

A April Washburn

“I have yet to meet anyone
who didn’t greet me with a smile.”

By Nadja Wolfe
STAFF WRITER

The Phi is happy to welcome
Mrs. April Washburn to her new
position as Administrative Assis-
tant for Campus Activities and
the Elrod Commons.

Mrs. Washbum had worked
part time in the Instructional
Technology Lab for the past two
years before succeeding Carol
Calkins in this position.

Mrs. Washburn has many re-
sponsibilities throughout her day
which vary from organizing stu-
dent activity room reservations to
setting up fundraising tables, as
well as administrative and cleri-
cal duties.

Her day usually begins with a
walkthrough to make certain that
everything is alright and in place.

After that, it’s set up, phone
calls, and as many as sixty emails
in a day (although she’s grateful
that doesn’t happen very often),
as well as a myriad of other tasks.

The W&L community has
made Mrs. Washbum feel right at
home in her new capacity.

“I have yet to meet anyone
who didn’t greet me with a smile
and a ‘Glad to see you’re here’
or ‘Nice to see your face
around,’” she said. “I wouldn’t
want [the transition] any other

99

way.

Other staff have been helpful as
well, including Mrs. Calkins, who,
having held the post for over
twenty years, is a wealth of infor-
mation and has made herself avail-
able to her successor.

One of Mrs. Washburn’s favor-
ite things about her new position
is that she gets to see more of W&L
students, especially for club
events, activities, and all sorts of
other important information.

Her pleasant personality and
smiling face are sure to greet ev-
eryone who comes to her office
and make them feel at home.

One need only to look at the pa-
pers from campus-wide groups in
neat piles in her office to know
they’re in good hands.

When not at work, Mrs.
Washbum likes to relax with her
family, including two sons, read,
and watch movies.

She also spends time coaching
volleyball, her lifelong passion, at
the local high school.

Since playing in grade school,
coaching has been a dream of hers,
and today she’s in her third year of
coaching at the high school.

Mrs. Washburn also likes to use
volleyball to bridge the gap be-
tween the university and the town.

Since last year, RCHS and
W&L volleyball players have at-
tended each others games.

This is just another aspect of her
welcoming and kind character.

Keep an eye out each week as we proﬁle staﬁ” and faculty members throughout the year:
Be sure and get to know your community and join the Phi in welcoming and celebrating our neighbors.’
