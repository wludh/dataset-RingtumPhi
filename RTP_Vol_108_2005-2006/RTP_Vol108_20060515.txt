A Saturday night inside the squad cars of

O

the Lexington Police Department

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

LEXINGTON--The dispatch
radio cackled to life, bringing
the ﬁrst call of Lexington Police
Sargeant. Bucky Miller’s 12-hour
shift on Saturday.

“Fifteen-20 to Central, I’ve
just picked up a black and white
collie mix with a collar and a lead
on it. Is there a way I can take the
dog over to the SPCA?”

Miller picked up his micro-
phone to answer Ofﬁcer Nathan
Kesterson.

The Sergeant said he would
meet Ofﬁcer Kesterson at the
SPCA building to help get the dog
locked up for the night.

Every weekend Miller and oth-

er oﬂicers patrol the streets of the
city, dealing with everything from
stray dogs to noise complaints to
drunk drivers.

On a regular weekend evening
anywhere from two to four ofﬁ-
cers will be on duty.

Saturday night there were
three oﬂicers on duty until mid-
night and two on duty after that.

After he and Kesterson tried
unsuccessfully to ﬁnd a way into
the SPCA building, they went to
the house of an SPCA worker and
asked her to come let the dog into
the building.

Kesterson took the dog back
to the shelter, and Miller resumed
his patrol.

Miller cruises the city streets
in an unmarked dark blue Crown

Victoria. The officers do not have
set patrol routes or sections of
the city that they are supposed to
cover.

Miller says the officers do not
divide the city into sections be-
cause it is so small, but also be-
cause they think it is important
for each ofﬁcer to get to know
people all over town rather than
in just one neighborhood.

He starts his weekend shift
when he stops by the police sta-
tion to check in and begin his pa-
trol.

Some nights will be quiet with
only a few calls, like Saturday,
while others, like Friday will
seem full of almost non-stop ac-
tion.

whichthe SPCA
reports is an Austra-
lian Shepherd, Miller resumes his
driving patrol, listening to radio
trafﬁc from Rockbridge County.
The squad car’s radio can pick
up not only the Lexington Police
calls, but also traﬂic from the
Rockbridge County Sheriff, the
Buena Vista Police Department,
the Buena Vista Rescue Service,
Virginia Military Institute’s Post
Police and even the radio traffic
from Washington and Lee’s secu-
rity department.

When Kesterson calls the dis-
patcher to say that the dog broke
his collar and escaped from out-
side the SPCA building, Miller
simply only shakes his head.

Kesterson searches the area
around the SPCA but cannot ﬁnd
the dog.

He radios Miller and asks
where he would like to eat. They
settle on Frank’s Pizza and Subs.

After two hours, Miller has
done little but drive around the
seemingly deserted streets.

He and Kesterson sit in
Frank’s talking politics. The
owner and waitresses all seem to
know Miller, and jokes with the
waitresses about one girl ’s newly
orange hair.

Finally, at 11:30 p.m., Miller

sitting around their cars in the
Kroger parking lot.

The unmarked car pulls into
the lot, and before Miller can
even pull up to the kids they are
starting to scatter. Miller does
not even have to say anything to
get the kids to move.

“I won’t waste my breath,”
he says. “They know they’re not
supposed to hang out there.”

Miller, who grew up in Lex-
ington, has worked for the city’s
police department since 1985.
He played football at Virginia
State University, located in Pe-
tersburg. His entire law en-
forcement career has been spent
in his hometown.

Miller says he isn’t sure how
much of his time is devoted to
Washington and Lee students or
permanent residents.

“It depends on what day of
the week it is,” Miller said.

Miller said that the oﬂicers
deal with students more on the
weekend, but even then he says
the number of calls or arrests var-
ies from week to week. Regard-
less of the varying time commit-
ments, Miller says he does not

Sigma pledge breaks mold

Jameson Graber becomes ﬁrst white man to join W&L is historically black fraternities

By Julie Petersen
STAFF WRITER

Those Washington and Lee stu-
dents lucky enough to be passing
by the Commons on the evening
of April 26 were able to catch a
glimpse of Phi Beta Sigma’s main
pledgeship event——the probate.

For the new initiates, who tra-
ditionally pledge in secrecy, the
probate is their opportunity to an-
nounce their aﬂiliation with their
new fraternity, demonstrate their
knowledge of fraternal traditions
and entertain the audience with
their greetings to other Greek or-
ganizations.

“Basically our probates are
supposed to be a fun entertain-
ment to get people hyped up,
maybe joke around with other
people and have fun,” said Junior
pledge Marcurius Byrd.

But aside from the antics of
the performance, spectators soon
noticed another curious sight—a
white man on the pledge line of
this historically black fraterni-
ty. Throughout the probate and
since, this unusual occurrence has
raised more than a few eyebrows
and even more questions.

As W&L’s ﬁrst non-minority

“I just felt like the guys in Phi Beta Sigma were

principled. That they were motivated by some-

thing a little bit deeper. ”

JAMESON GRABER, Class of 2008
 

member of the traditionally black
Greek organizations, sophomore
Jameson Graber, along with his
new Phi Beta Sigma fraternity
brothers, is helping to tear down
barriers on our campus by just
hanging out with his friends.
Unlike the historically black
sororities on campus, Phi Beta
Sigma has its own charter at
W&L. The two sororities are
associated with chapters at other
schools. Delta Sigma Theta joined
a chapter at Roanoke College, and
the Alpha Kappa Alpha joined a
graduate chapter in Roanoke.
Graber is eager to explain that,
though his decision may be un-
orthodox here at W&L, Phi Beta
Sigma is just the right ﬁt for him.
“I think those who know me
know that I am full of endless
contradictions. I want to say I’m
sort of counter-cultural, but at the

same time I consider myself pret-
ty conservative,” said Graber. “I
just don’t identify with the main-
stream usually.”

Graber was exposed to the
fraternity scene last year as a
freshman and opted to remain an
Independent, deciding that most
fraternal cultures did not coin-
cide with his own sense of priori-
ties. When he joined this year’s
Student Activities Organization
basketball team, he found himself
building friendships with many
of the Sigma members. After
spending time with the brothers
and learning about the fratemity’s
goals, particularly its community
service involvement, pledging
felt like the next natural step.

“I already had a connection
with them, so I wasn’t just joining
a group to gain status or anything.
I was just joining something that

my friends were already in,” said
Graber.

Phi Beta Sigma tends to at-
tract many members who would
have otherwise chosen to forego
the traditional W&L fraternity
experience. The ﬂedgling Beta
Beta Nu chapter was brought to
campus just last year to provide
a unique Greek experience for
those men not satisﬁed with the
current options. Charter mem-
bers, as well as this year’s diverse
line, found themselves drawn to
the fratemity’s accepting attitude
and commitment to community
service.

“The best thing about our
frat is that you are who you are.
We’re not there to change you.
We’re all different people, differ-
ent backgrounds,” said fraternity
secretary and charter member Ju-
lian Ledford.

Phi Beta Sigma was the ﬁrst of
the historically black fraternities
to open its membership to non-
minority men. Since that deci-
sion, the fraternity has shifted its
attentions to focus on multicultur-
alism and acceptance, rather than
a single race.

“Sigma prides itself in being a
brotherhood of diverse people,”

said Chris Rucker, a freshman
pledge.

Sigma members emphasize
that the true binding force of
their brotherhood is not any type
of ethnicity, but instead their
passion for community service.
When most fraternities are gear-
ing up for their next big party,
the W&L Sigmas can usually be
found playing basketball with
the boys at Natural Bridge Cor-
rectional Facility or raising funds
for the Staunton Pregnancy Help
Center at the Walk for Life. For
Graber, who organized the W&L
Walk for Life team, the fratemi-
ty’s focus on service conveyed a
set of priorities more in sync with
his own.

“I just felt like the guys in Phi
Beta Sigma were principled. That
they were motivated by something
a little bit deeper,” said Graber.
“The Sigmas on this campus are
real. There’s something genuine
about them.”

The new brotherhood has been
encouraged by this year’s line and
expects to grow in numbers in fu-
ture years.

“You know,” said Junior Frank
Lee, “there’s just not that much
difference between us.”

Here is the latest update on who
ran afoul of the law during the last
few weeks. We took a peek at this
weeks police reports to see what

you ’ve been up to...

 

Not the time for a
stoll around town

Lexington resident Frank
Merchant was arrested and
charged with public intoxi-
cation on Friday, April 28.
Merchant, who is 23-years-
old, was stopped at 10:53

of Richmond, was arrested
by Ofﬁcer Stewart on the
evening of Saturday, May

6. Stewart, who joined the
Lexington Police in Novem-
ber, stopped the 25- year-
old Moore and arrested him
at 11:20 p.m.

Local joins visitors
Jesse Lyons, a 27-year-old
who lives in Lexington, was

Huffman of the Lexington
Police Department on Sat-
urday, May 6 at 11:51 p.m.

other Lexington Police of-
ﬁcers were at the gas station
when Manning arrived to

purchase some food.

Drinking and walking
Benjamin Jaskiewicz, a
sophomore at W&L, was
charged with being drunk in

distinguish between students and
other residents.

“I don’t look at it as student
population and town population.
I just look at it as one commu-
nity,” he said.

The sergeant says that he and
the other officers do not like hav-
ing to arrest people — students or
residents — for drinking offenses.

“Nobody likes to go to jail,
and we don’t really like to take
people to jail,” Miller said. “What
people don’t realize is that when
they drink and it doesn’t look like
they’re going to make it home,
it’s our responsibility to make
sure they get taken care of.”

At 11:00 p.m., Ofﬁcer Leon-
ard Stewart came on duty. Of-
ﬁcer Kesterson’s shift ends at
midnight, leaving just Miller and
Stewart at work. Stewart, who
is also a Lexington native, lives
on Maury Street next door to the
house he grew up in.

Stewart has been in law en-
forcement for 18 years, working
in Northern Virginia, on the VMI
Post Police, and with the Lexing-
ton Police since November.

Just after midnight, the two of-
ficers responded to a noise com-
plaint at McLaughlin and White
Street. Miller knocked on the
apartment door, and told the stu-
dent that if the oﬁicers are called
back a second time, they will
write a summons, and if they are
called back a third time they will
arrest the student.

Shortly after 12:30 a.m., at
the intersection of Tucker and
Massie, Stewart stopped a man
carrying an open can of beer and
a plastic bag full of several un-
opened cans. Stewart leapt out
of his car and asked the man to
stop. After checking the subject’s
ID and making him pour out the
open beer can, Stewart let the
man continue his walk home.

At 12:55 a.m., employees at
the Palms called the police de-
partment because a patron in the
bar appeared to have passed out.
When a Palms employee walked
over to ask if the man needed
help, the man’s wife became an-
gry and refused to leave. The
woman continued to argue with
the employees, promting them to
call the central dispatcher.

When Stewart and Miller ar-
rived, several VMI Keydets had
canied the man out of the Palms

and started taking him home.

Another man waiting outside
the bar then tried to re-enter the
building. The man insisted that
he wanted to come in and started
swearing at the employee in the
doorway. Miller spun around and,
using what he calls his “voice of
authority,” told the man to sit
down and be quiet.

While Miller went into the bar
to make sure things had calmed
down, the man started yelling at
Stewart. When Miller exited the
bar, the two ofﬁcers arrested the
still—shouting man and charged
him with being drunk in public.
They emptied his pockets and
loaded him into the backseat of
Stewart’s squad car. The man
had difficulty getting into the car
and struggled to tell Stewart his
name.

At the jail, Stewart pulled his
car through the barbed wire fence
and then into a small garage which
has a door that locks behind his
car. He took the man inside the
jail, where three jail employees
were waiting. As Stewart ﬁlled
out the necessary paperwork, the
man became increasingly agi-
tated. When two jail guards tried
to remove the necklaces the pris-
oner was wearing (one of them
a St. Christopher’s medallion),
the man had to be physically re-
strained from trying to retrieve
his necklace. Still handcuffed, he
was put in a holding cell where
he could be heard shouting at the
two guards.

Having ﬁnished his trip to jail,
Stewart cruised past what had
been a crowded W&L party at
the intersection of Randolph and
Massie. The time was now 1:30
a.m., and only a few students re-
mained in the house.

Miller, meanwhile, had agreed
to give some of the law gradu-
ates a ride home from the Palms.
One graduate and his ﬁance’ piled
into the back seat of Miller’s un-
marked car and asked if they can
get a ride to Woods Creek. The
graduate initially asked to be
dropped off up the street from his
building but changed his mind
when Miller teased that he was
afraid of his friends seeing him in
a police car.

For next several hours, Miller
and Stewart patrolled the quiet
streets. Only a noise complaint
at 2:50 a.m. broke the silence.
Another night on the Lexington
streets was drawing to a close.

THE RING-TUM PHI - 3

UDIIIIOIIS

 

editor

Onyx. defends administration

Undergraduate black student organization responds to letter that criticized university admissions policies

To the Editor:
The letter submitted from the
Concerned Parent that appeared

‘ in the April 24 issue of the Ring-

tum Phi was most troubling to the
officers of the racially inclusive
undergraduate black student or-

‘ ganization, Onyx.

The highly inﬂammatory letter
calls into question the qualiﬁca-
tions of black and Latino students
attending Washington and Lee.
The administration was also im-
plicated in instituting policies that
the parent believes are “detrimen-
tal to the University.”

The parent raises several times
the question of whether minor-
ity students are given preference
in the admissions process and
whether ﬁnancial incentives are
given to students of color to en-
courage them to attend.

While we do not claim to know
the inner workings of the Admis-
sions Department, we are aware
that the ﬁnancial incentives have
helped to expose Washington and
Lee University to a more diverse
pool of applicants. We can only
surmise that these incentives are
reﬂective of the socio-economic
backgrounds of many of the re-
cipients.

The parent asks to have the
standardized test score data for
the entering freshmen class for
the past ten years broken down by
ethnicity as well as citing statis-
tics that state that black students
score lower on the SAT than white
students.

The parent fails to mention the
score differences that also exist
between male and female students
and students who attended public
school versus private school.

SAT tutoring, coaching and
prep classes, another confound-
ing variable, is an issue not even
taken into consideration by the
parent.

Furthermore, the parent does
not even attempt to offer up a
possible cause to the score dis-
crepancy that may exist.

While Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation of Topeka (1954) may have
prohibited the dejure segregation
of public education facilities, the
truth of the matter is that defacto
segregation still exists.

The educational system con-
tinues to be segregated because
residential segregation continues
to persist as well.

Students largely attend schools
in their neighborhood and as a re-

Student calls for
open administration

To the Editor:

It is nice to see some contro-
versy at Washington and Lee.

I’m referring, of course, to the
Phi’s May 4 issue, which featured
a two—page parade of anti-Con-
cemed Parent letters.

The letters contained a barrage
of claims that I will not be able to
deal with entirely.

There were two broad points
made by students that I will deal
with.

The ﬁrst was that SAT scores
are not enough to measure a stu-
dent. Several reasons are given,
most of them quite reasonable.
Gabe Chapman points out, cor-

The purpose of educa-
tion is to transcend
one is background in or-
der to think objectively,
logically and fairly.

rectly, that rich students have an
inherent advantage on the SAT.
This advantage is not limited to
the SAT and should be taken into
account in all areas of the admis-
sions criteria.

However, the SAT was de-
signed to ensure that the admis-
sions process would not be ar-
bitrary. (See Dinesh D’Souza’s
Illiberal Education, page 44,
where he also notes that “studies
show that the SAT is a fairly reli-
able indicator of college prepara-
tion.”)

We must not seek to undercut
its validity just because we are
unhappy with the results. If it can
be shown objectively (without re-
garding how the scores turn out)
that the SAT is inherently biased,
then we should change it after
careful consideration.

But the SAT continues to be
a successful indicator of poten-
tial for college success, and I
doubt the seriousness of such bias
claims.

The second point is stated best
and most disturbingly by Chap-
man: “Let us reafﬁrm our univer-
sity’s right to compose each class

as it sees ﬁt....” Now it’s not the
university’s power that is in ques-
tion, but rather its integrity. The
university certainly has the right
to admit students unfairly, but
only at the expense of high stan-
dards.

There are those who think
diverse ethnic backgrounds are
essential for any student body be-
cause different backgrounds cre-
ate different perspectives. This
idea may have some merit for
creative work, but not for educa-
tion in general. The purpose of
education is to transcend one’s
background in order to think ob-
jectively, logically and fairly. In
other words, if your perspective is
solely based on your background,
then your education has done you
no good.

Some might respond that edu-
cation is not provided equally
at the high school level and that
therefore college admissions
should respond to this disparity.
This argument has some merit,
but I suspect the disparity exists
between rich and poor rather than
between races.

As I said, I do not have a prob-
lem with taking economics into
account in admissions criteria,
so long as we consider each ap-
plicant as an individual and not
as a potential source of diversity
points.

Now that I have responded to
these broad points, I suppose the
real question is whether our ad-
missions policies are, in fact, ra-
cially biased.

If I am not mistaken, the let-
ter from Concerned Parent was a
request for just that information
that might shed some light on this
issue.

If the administration would
not mind doing more than just as-
serting its own integrity, it might
lay out the relevant statistics that
would prove this parent wrong.

Do I think our admissions pol-
icies are ﬂawed?

I am not sure.

There is one question to con-
sider, given all the common
knowledge about academic per-
formance among different races.

Where are all the Asians?

P. Jameson Graber
Class of 2008

It should be noted that black students rep-
resent only 4 percent of the school, and the

total white, non Hispanic, population only

constitutes 13 percent of the student body.

sult, the school is going to be re-
ﬂective of the racial make up of
the community.

Could the differences in test
scores be a vestige of America’s
highly racist and oppressive past
and indicative of a greater soci-
etal problem, the inequality of
education and life experiences of
black and white youth?

The claim that the black popu-
lation at Washington and Lee has
increased by more than 100 per-
cent in the last decade was found
to be humorous.

For simplicity, let’s round the
number of black students up to
80, from the accurate number of
78; we do not see going from 40
to 80 students out of a population
of almost 1,800 over the course
of ten years as being alarming or
representing a major threat.

It should be noted that black
students represent only 4 percent
of the school, and the total white,
non Hispanic, population only
constitutes 13 percent of the stu-
dent body.

There are only about I00 black
and Hispanic students. Could it
not be possible for Washington
and Lee to ﬁnd 100 “qualiﬁed”
black and Hispanic students of
color in the entire nation?

The parent also says that they
do not believe in helping one
group of people by hurting an-
other group.

Is this implying that the deci-
sion to admit women an example
of helping one group by hurting
another?

Is the decision to admit any
student of color another exam-
ple?

What about admitting more
students from certain states, or
those who are of differing reli-
gious faiths or from various so-
cio-economic backgrounds?

The parent’s usage of the term
“minority” is also problematic.

Although it is widely used to
refer to multicultural groups, a
minority could also be deﬁned
as “a group having little power
or representation relative to other
groups within a society.”

This deﬁnition is reﬂective
of the way that people of color
have been historically treated in
America.

Racism, discrimination and
racial inequality continue to ex-
ist, and continue to affect people
of color in virtually every facet of
life.

We see no problem with hav-
ing race or ethnicity being one of
the many factors taken into con-
sideration with regards to admis-
sion.

It appears that the parent fails
to understand that the college
admissions process is a complex
one.

It can not be reduced to a for-
mula to determine who gains ac-
ceptance and who does not.

Many more students apply
than there is capacity, thus the
Board of Trustees and the Ad-
missions Department determines
which characteristics they would
like to see in potential students.

Test scores do play an impor-
tant part of the application pro-
cess; however, they are most cer-
tainly not the sole component.

The Admissions Department
also takes into consideration ex-
tracurricular activities, the per-
sonal essay, the three letters of
recommendation and the inter-
view to determine eligibility.

It seems that the parent is ad-
vocating that society returns to the
days of yore when people of color
were unable to gain admittance to
institutions of higher learning.

The strides that Washington
and Lee University have taken
need to be commended, not criti-
cized.

The institution has strived to
become more diverse and inclu-
sive, and these efforts should be
respected and applauded.

The lessons of Duke

Why the lacrosse scandal in Durham could easily happen at Washington and Lee

By Jennlfer Sutton
c o L u M N I s T
It sounds like something

straight out of Tom Wolfe’s Bon-
ﬁre of the Vanities: wealth, privi-
lege, strippers, rape (in lieu of
murder) and racial politics.

Durham, N.C., has become
the latest racial platform for race-
mongrels like Al Sharpton and his
cronies to march down to Durham
and hold massive protests.

A racial divide has engulfed a
community, tragedy has occurred
and an entire school is being
blamed for the suspected actions
of a few.

However, all of this is cloud-
ing the bigger issue; if this trag-
edy can happen at Duke, it can
happen anywhere.

Thus, I implore you to think
twice, as enticing as I am sure it
may be, the next time one of your
frat brothers, or the like, suggests
hiring townies from the surround-
ing areas to strip or do something
equally ridiculous. While this may
sound like a ludicrous scenario,
remind yourself what is happen-
ing at Duke.

I have always been a propo-
nent of siding with the victim
in rape cases, but this time the
evidence and circumstances that
have surrounded the Duke la-
crosse scandal appear to have
marred our perception of who is
really at fault.

If the accused are guilty, then
they have desecrated the name of
all Caucasian suburban athletes at
top schools.

If reports are accurate that
an unnamed third player will be
charged, this time with reliable
DNA evidence that links him to
the crime (in this case that the
suspect’s skin tissue may have
been found under the victim’s

Evidence that has surfaced, including time-

lines with receipts, a lack of DNA evidence and

fake nail,) then that individual
should, without a doubt, be held
accountable for his horrendous
actions.

But what if the others accused
are not at fault?

Evidence that has surfaced, in-
cluding time-lines with receipts, a
lack of DNA evidence and prior
false accusations on the part of
the accuser have made us ques-
tion her credibility.

In addition, there appears to be
bias on Prosecutor Nifong’s end,
a man who was just successfully
re-elected, by appealing to the
angry residents of Durham with
a campaign centered on the Duke
case.

But let me be perfectly clear,
my doubt from this case stems
only from surrounding evidence
that has emerged, not from any
sort of elitist racial-bias.

That said, the proﬁle of these
students is eerily familiar: upper-
middle class, Caucasian athletes
hailing from suburban Northeast.

These are individuals who
seem to work hard, at least enough
to gain acceptance to Duke, and
play hard both outside the class-
room and on the ﬁeld.

Does this sound familiar to
you?

It should, aﬁer all, this image
is a classic stereotype of Wash-
ington and Lee and many other
top-schools around the country.

But make no mistake. Given

THE RING-TUM PHI IS A

the right circumstances, this type
of scenario can unfold itself at
W&L or elsewhere.

It can happen to your friend,
your frat brother or anyone else
you know.

Hopefully, we know bet-
ter. Hopefully, we are not crazy
enough to call up local strippers
from neighboring Rockbridge
County (why one would actually
want to do this, is a whole differ-
ent question).

And of course, I’d like to as-
sume that the Honor System
would prevent such a situation
from happening.

Nonetheless, we are not im-
mune. Six percent of the W&L
women interviewed in an anon-
ymous survey said they were
victims of an attempted rape in
2005.

Consequently, if these stu-
dents are guilty, then I hope that
justice will be served and that
these students will pay dearly for
their crime.

However, what if their only
crime was their intoxication and
thereby their inability to make ra-
tional decisions?

In an instance like this, should
inebriation equal automatic guilt?

I’m not claiming to be the
standard for morality, far from it.

However, I have seen both
my friends from school and from
home in precarious situations be-
cause of alcohol.

staffeditorial

In fact, when this story ﬁrst
broke, I immediately thought of
my friends at schools where ath-
letic teams are the equivalent of
fraternities.

These are teams where the
premise of an evening is to get
as a drunk as possible and hit on
random girls.

I have no doubt that these
teams or organizations, either
Greek or athletic, are not impervi-
ous to any-type of alcohol-fueled
debauchery.

Could this tragedy at Duke
have been prevented for all par-
ties?

I would like to think so.

If someone had been sober
enough to either stop what was
going on, or to realize that this
woman, allegedly, arrived shoe-
less and in no state to work, may-
be none of this would have hap-
pened. Maybe someone would
have simply sent the strippers
home.

Instead, these boys, guilty or
not, will be used as a pawns in
larger racial game in Durham for
years to come.

They’re caught at the center of
race, gender, and socio-economic
conﬂicts that were simmering in
Durham long before they arrived
at Duke.

And imagine, it could have all
been prevented if someone, any-
one had the brains to be cognizant
of what was going on.

The moral of this story?

Be aware of your actions,
or at least have friends who are
looking out for you when, and if,
you choose to drink yourself into
oblivion (not that I am advocating
blacking-out).

Maybe then we will decrease
our chances of tragedy occurring
in Lexington.

 

To the Editor:

I just ﬁnished read-
ing the April 24 edi-
tion of the Ring—tum Phi

and am deeply con-
cerned about two edi-
torials. Is Washington

and Lee becoming another
PC Liberal Arts univer-
sity?

If so, then it is not the
school I thought it would
be.

Coming from Cali-
fornia, a land where
anything goes, I wanted a
more “traditional” type of
education for my son.

A highly challeng-
ing approach to educa-
tion with a conserva-

tive student body is
what I thought would be of
great value.

I thought Wash-
ington and

Lee was swathed in tra-
dition and would not be
a follower of political
correctness but a continu-
ing trailblazer for hon-
or and integrity. I was
saddened to read that some
discrimination may exist
through afﬁrmative action.

Does this University
show preferences based on
race?

editor

Just another PC

stitution remains a

and Lee University will be
a great disappointment.

I really hope this very re-
spected institution remains
a bastion of “saneness and
integrity” and continues
to have a clear and fo-
cused vision that stresses a
balanced and traditional
approach to higher educa-

Right of press limited by EC

A public hearing impossible to reach without full freedom of the press

Throughout the centuries,
the general public’s sole defense
against deception has been a free
press.

The United States Constitu-
tion protects it, the population
depends on it, and absolute power
abhors it.

Last week, the Executive
Committee tried to stiﬂe it.

Press coverage of the planned
Student Body Hearing last week
was effectively prohibited by the
EC’s ban of notepads, pens, and
recording devices.

The accused student, found
guilty by the few powerful mem-
bers of the committee in a closed
hearing, found his or her cause
valuable enough to request that
the public decide.

But the public would have

' been shut out.

Lee Chapel only holds 525 stu-
dents, leaving a large majority of
the 2000-plus student population
out of the “community of trust.”

Students are expected to keep
information within the commu-
nity of trust.

Yet most students are denied
membership into this community.

A free press was designed to
solve this problem.

The purpose of newspaper
from the very start has been to
provide public information to
masses.

This information includes
everything that is vital to the
comfortable citizenship of every
member of a society.

A reporter is supposed to be
there when the citizens cannot.

Thomas Jefferson once said

that “our liberty cannot be guard-
ed but by the freedom of the
press.”

How can our liberty be guard-
ed when the majority of the citi-
zens neither know nor understand
the major principles which guide
their everyday life?

The honor system is intended
to be ﬂexible so that it may apply
its standards of gentlemanly con-
duct in a way that has effectively
governed students for over a hun-
dred years.

A key factor in its ﬂexibility is
the ability of the current student
population to make decisions de-
termining the deﬁnition of honor.

If the student population can-
not participate in this decision,
they have been cheated.

Any attempt by the press to
cover an event at which they were
not allowed to take notes would
result in gross inaccuracies.

Any attempt to restrict its cov-
erage would result in a hundred
false rumors.

As information of the hear-
ing slowly leaked from the door-
way of Lee Chapel, it would
pass through campus in whispers
which would grow into screams,
the truth growing into a mistruth
and eventually ending in a com-
plete absence of fact.

The ability of the press to cov-
er such an event would protect the
accused from the damage of these
lies.

The press was closed out of
the hearing, something Chairman
Wheeler Sparks explained as pro-
tection of “fairness of process for
the accused.”

If students cannot make it into Lee Chapel,

how can we maintain the honor system Robert

E. Lee helped found?

 

Did the student not request a
public hearing?

The accused, in accordance
with White Book policy, request-
ed that the facts of the case be
placed before the public in order
to determine and also deﬁne our
standards of honor.

Yet, if the hearing had actually
taken place, less than one quarter
of the “public” could have actu-
ally been present to hear the case.

Is the hearing truly public if
most of the public cannot attend?

Information, when presented
to the public, is determined true
or false by the public market of
ideas.

It is the right of this accused
student to allow the public to de-
cide the truth.

The system is designed with
trust in the community’s sense of
honon

When the community cannot
participate, that trust is violated.

Further, students place trust in
the Executive Committee.

We elect these powerful offi-
cials, but then rarely get to moni-
tor their actions.

A student body hearing is an
important opportunity to evaluate
their performance and worthiness
as leaders.

If less than a quarter of us can

attend, we simply cannot make a

I

complete and thorough evalua- 1

tion.

If students cannot make it into
Lee Chapel, how can we maintain
the honor system Robert E. Lee
helped found?

His inﬂuence, still deeply felt
within the conﬁnes of the Wash-
ington and Lee community, con-
tinues to guide the population and
its governing principles.

Lee said, “Do your duty in all
things. You cannot do more; you
should never wish to do less.”

It is the duty of the Executive
Committee, based on the princi-
ples on which they were elected,
to ensure that the honor system is
justly followed.

Meanwhile, it is the duty of
the press to monitor this govem-
ing body and the citizens ruled by
it.

This action by the press allows
for the fair dissemination of infor-
mation.

The direct result of this infor-
mation is more responsible citi-
zenship, which includes a fair and
truly public trial for the accused.

The EC is allowed to exercise
their duties without censure or
hindrance by the press.

We let you do your job. Please
let us do ours.

Senior Wins teaching award

Joe Franzen plans to use the $4,000 stipend to purchase computers for his middle school classroom

By Stacey Grljalva
surr wrursn

Who couldn’t use an extra
$4,000 after graduation?

One senior, who won that sti-
pend, intends to use the money
not to repay loans or for a car, but
on his middle school kids.

Joseph Franzen plans to teach
in either Kentucky or in Rock-
bridge. He hopes to use the mon-
ey on computers.

“Technology is such a huge
part and is largely utilized in the
classroom ,” he said.

Franzen won the Sarah G. Ball
Teaching Award, which gives the
money to a graduating senior who
will teach in an area with diverse
needs.

The award was named in hon-
or of Sarah Ball, Class of 2001.

Despite being able to spend
the money in any way, all the win-
ners have chosen not to spend the
salary supplement on themselves.
One past winner even used the
money to buy winter coats for her
students.

“Every winner has used the
award to buy things for the class-
room, without exception,” said
Nan Partlett, Director of Teacher
Education.

This year’s winner, in addition
to teaching, will be studying for
his masters and his certiﬁcation.

Partlett said Franzen stood out
from the other applicants because

of his very serious commitment
to teaching and his knowledge of
teaching learned from watching
his mother and grandmother, who
are both teachers.

Franzen was a double major in
American History and Anthropol-
ogy before taking any education
classes.

“I did child care and got deep
into it,” he said. “It just clicked.”

Franzen has been an enrich-
ment tutor and taught in class-
rooms as part of the education
practicum, a chance for W&L
students to actually teach for 60
or 70 hours in one semester.

As the only male sixth grade
teacher, Franzen connected with
some of his male students that
had been labeled as bad boys.

“It’s an adventure,” he said.
“The best part is seeing a change.
I had one student who wasn’t
passing when I started and he
raised it to a low C. He felt like he
could do this.”

In case Franzen is unable to
teach next year, the alternate for
the award is Sarah Weil.

Already certiﬁed, Weil plans
on teaching in Maryland or Penn-
sylvania.

A politics major, Weil decided
to pass on law school in favor of
teaching in an area where she was
needed.

She said, “I wanted to do
something that helps people with-
out charging $150 an hour.”

Sarah Weil’s students employ creative techniques for a project In her practicum classroom. The politics major
decided to forgo law school in order to teach in an underprivlledged area where her skills are needed.

Saving lives one letter at a time

Senior Amanda Dysart organized the W&L chapter of Up ‘Til Dawn and helped to raise thousands of dollars

The W&L community stepped up behind

Dysart’s lead to raise money for children with

cancer at St. Jude’s. By writing 50 letters each,

members of Up ‘Til Dawn made $20,169.49 in

the past year which will help cover the cost of

treating children whose families cannot pay.

By Steph Wlechmann
surr wmrsn

Ben’s father spoke with tears
in his eyes. After losing his
young son to cancer, addressing
a room ﬁill of co1lege—age stu-
dents reminded him of the life
his son would never have.

Yet, the message he brought
was ﬁlll of hope. Without St.
Jude’s Children’s Hospital, he
would not have had as many
years with Ben as he did.

He, like hundreds of thou-
sands of other parents, was
grateful for the research being
done at the unique hospital in
Memphis, Tenn.

“We still need to keep doing
it,” he said.

Within the audience crying
with him was Amanda Dysart.

After her visit to St. Jude’s,
the English major saw the need
to help the facility.

She immediately brought
that passion back to Washington
and Lee.

Dysart started the W&L
chapter of Up ‘Til Dawn, a na-
tional ﬁindraising campaign for
St. Jude’s.

She organized the chapter
this year by working with the
national board, selecting an

 

executive committee at the uni-
versity and recruiting fundrais-
ing participants.

Her efforts helped to raise
$20,169.49 in a matter of
months.

The money raised will pay
for research and treatment of
childhood cancer for families
who cannot pay for care.

All patients at St. Jude’s are
never billed.

Regardless of their ﬁnancial
situation, sick children and their
families can get the help they
need.

Dysart and her fundraising
team did not hold a telethon.
They did not sell chocolate bars
or pizzas. They did not have a
car wash. They simply wrote
letters.

Dysart recruited and orga-
nized 25 teams of students to
ﬁmdraise with a letter—writing

campaign.

Each student gathered the
names of 30 to 50 family mem-
bers and friends and sent out
form letters asking for dona-
tions.

St. Jude’s fonn letters show
the face of childhood cancer.
Abbi, a blue-eyed two-year-old,
stares up from the page, while
a sidebar tells its recipient her
story.

She was diagnosed with
acute myeloid leukemia when
she was ﬁve—months—old.

Even though her parents
could not pay for treatment,
Abbi was taken in by the St.
Jude’s staff and is in remission
today.

As the letter with her picture
and story reminds potential do-
nors, it is ﬁindraising money
that keeps the hospital going.

“Your gift today,” it reads,
“will help pay for the chemo-
therapy, radiation and bone
marrow transplants that save
the lives of these innocent chil-
dren... so they can have the
chance to grow up and go to
college, too.”

Like the family and friends
that donated, Dysart was moved
by the mission of St. Jude’s.
“When I began the project,” she
said, ‘‘I wasn’t so emotionally
invested in it. Then I actually

“You have to be invested in
the cause. You ’ve got to see
your goal and keep going
towards it. ”

went [to St. Jude’s].”

At the hospital, the environ-
ment is entirely different from
clichéd pistachio green walls
and the smell of antiseptic.

Corridors are ﬁlled with
brightly—colored cartoon mu-
rals.

The sounds of video games
echo from a special room for
teenagers. No one over the age
of 19 is allowed in — especially
parents.

Doctors tend to their small
patients in special ways. “They
will draw pictures on kids’ fac-
es when they are having their
MRIs,” said Dysart, “so kids
don’t get freaked out.”

St. Jude’s does not just calm
the children.

Worried parents are also tak-
en care of. Depending on the
length of their stay, parents are
housed in hotels or their own
apartments.

Personal chefs cook dinner
for those with more on their
minds.

There are gyms for exercise,
and the hospital employs pro-
fessional masseuses to knead
stress away.

St. Jude’s also conducts im-
portant research on childhood
cancer, to one day ﬁnd a cure.
And, said Dysart, “they don’t
hide their research. As soon as
they get results, they share it.
So other hospitals can beneﬁt,
too.”

Dysart kneels over a large
banner that lays on the ﬂoor,
which reads “W&L Loves St.
Jude’s.”

What seems like thousands
of separate handprints border
the words in swatches of blue,
red, yellow and green.

In the background, live mu-
sic from Jacob’s Ladder invades
the gymnasium.

This is the reward for the
hard work of the year. Up ‘Till

where the movement gets its
name.

Several students tap their
feet to music while decorat-
ing homemade greeting cards

— those a week later that will be
hanging from children’s bulletin
boards at St. Jude’s.

Dysart, whose small frame
seems to shrink into her sur-
roundings, speaks about the up-
beat attitude you must have for
a project like this.

“You have to be invested in
the cause. You’ve got to see
your goal and keep going to-
wards it.” '

GSA opens the closet

Rainbow week is a celebration of tolerance and open—mindedness

The Gay-Straight Alliance has made strides

since its small beginning six years ago. With

acceptance and tolerance as its mission, the

group had instituted several traditions on

campus, including Rainbow Week.

By Stacey Grljalva
STAFF WRITER

The Skittles and drag show
may have been missing but the
Gay-Straight Alliance celebrated
Rainbow Week in full force last
week. .

Events included a showing of
movies, “Hug a Homo” day, and
culminated in the second annual
trip to Roanoke’s gay bar, The
Park.

“Rainbow Week is open to ev-
erybody, even if you’re not a GSA
member,” said GSA’s incoming
president, Stephanie Wiechmann.
“By coming, you learn about us,
we learn about you. Tolerance
doesn’t have one face, it’s not
from the North or South.”

Originally begun as a week-
long celebration of Calvin Awk-
ward’s birthday (May 10), the
GSA has come a long way from
its inception in 2000.

Started by three students with
a mission to change the univer-
sity’s nondiscrimination policy
to include sexual orientation, the
group now focuses on tolerance
and acceptance.

A hallmark of the association’s
work is the voluntary Safe Place
program. Stickers mark the doors
and offices of students, faculty
and staff on campus

“The stickers denote that any-
one can feel conﬁdent to talk to
the person about issues of sexual
orientation and won’t be made
fun of,” said Wiechmann.

The Safe Place program has
also helped faculty and staff to
come out.

Before the program, accord-
ing GSA’s president, no faculty or
staff were openly gay.

On the GSA website, one stu-
dent remembers her ﬁrst GSA
meeting.

She had asked how many un-
dergraduate students were openly
gay. The answer, in 2002, was
zero.

Now, four years later, the num-
ber is eight to ten. The number
varies because some students are
out to only their friends or their
frat or only the GSA.

Matthew Hampton, the out-
going vice president, remembers
coming out in the fall of his fresh-
man year three years ago.

“I fell in love with a guy,” he
said. “He made me feel that it’s
ok. I was ﬁnally proud and will-
ing. I told whoever asked. I didn’t
t:ry to act straight anymore.”

Wiechmann said that, on aver-
age, ten percent of any population
is gay or lesbian.

Even by conservative stan-
dards of four percent, W&L falls
short of normalcy.

Wiechmarm suggested that
there may be more gays on cam-
pus but that they have not come
out yet. Part of the GSA’s mission
is to provide an accepting envi-
ronment.

“Calvin has made being gay
more upbeat and non-threaten-
ing,” she said. “People seek us

out. We don’t presume anyone
is gay or straight. We presume a
blank sexual orientation until we
are told.”

Members of the alliance do
not have to be gay or lesbian to
join. In fact, Wiechmarm said that
80 to 90 percent of the group is
straight.

The support has made a differ-
ence for Hampton.

He said he has gone from con-
sidering transferring his freshman
year to not even thinking about his
sexuality being an issue because
everyone has been so accepting.

Hampton thinks that the differ-
ence has come from how people
view him.

“I ﬁt into the stereotype [of
W&L] but I just happen to be
gay,” he said. “People saw me as
Matthew, not that gay freshman.
Sexual orientation is just a small
part of who you are. ”

Hampton said that Awkward’s
strong leadership as a gay man
has helped to make the GSA a
strong presence on campus.

The GSA wants people to
know who they are and what they

are about without being pushy.

Their events are about vis-
ibility without being offensive.
Hampton said they are not re-
cruiting gay members or even
about activism.

“If gay students are not out be-
cause they feel the environment is
not conducive, then I have a prob-
lem with that,” said Hampton.
“No one should have to suffer the
way that people in the closet suf-
fer.”

“If that’s not the case, then I
don’t have a problem with a small
number of out students.”

In the undergraduate cata-
logue, the group is classiﬁed un-
der multicultural associations.

“We work for tolerance of the
minority by the majority,” said
Wiechmann. “So we are consid-
ered by the university as multi-
cultural.”

The GSA may have come a
long way from its beginnings six
years ago, but its presence is still
necessary.

“There isn’t another group that
deals with tolerance of sexual ori-
entation.”’

A riot of song and dance
will debut in the Keller
Theatre this weekend as
“The Pirates of Penzance,”
a Gilbert and Sullivan
comic opera, is performed
by W&L students.

The opera, according
to the theatre department’s

ous farce of sentimental pi-
rates, bumbling policemen,
dim—witted young lovers,
dewy-eyed daughters and
an eccentric Major-Gener-
al, all morally bound to the
often-ridiculous dictates of
honor and duty.”

“It’s really going to be
a high quality production,”
said Julie Petersen, one of
the cast members.

The approximately 30
cast members have been
practicing since the begin-
ning of winter term.

John Henderson, an-
other cast member, said
the cast started learning the
music for the show ﬁrst.

The practices were only
once a week, he said, but
when spring term started
the cast upped their prac-
tices to three hours a night,
six to seven days a week.

“It’s deﬁnitely been a lot
of work,” he said. “But it’s
been a lot of fun. Every-
one is having a great time
and we’re all committed to
the production.”

“We have rehearsal all
the time,” said Petersen,

 

Comic opera performed at Lenfest

website, “spins an hilari- ,

“but it’s worth it.”

Kenny Kraft and Lisa
Zevorich play the leads
in the production. Kraft
plays Frederic, a man that
has been mistakenly ap-
prenticed to a band of pi-
rates instead of a pilot.

“Kraft is actually pretty
good,” said stage director
Paten Hughes. “He has a
lot of charisma and has
probably grown the most
in his role.”

“You hear him in SoC0,”
said Petersen, “but I never
appreciated how amazing
of a voice he had.”

Zevorich plays Mabel,
the daughter of a Major-
General, who falls in love
with Frederic only to be
hampered by his father and
his disapproval of Freder-
ic’s status as a pirate.

“She has an amazing
voice,” said Hughes. “It’s
absolutely gorgeous. I
don’t know how she does
it.”

After a series of hu-
morous events, the pirates
must endure a battle with
a police force. The victors
of the ﬁght help to deter-
mine the fate of Frederic
and Mabel.

So do the lovers reunite
at the end of the opera or
are they doomed to lead
separate lives because of
Frederic’s occupation?

To ﬁnd out, go see the
production.

It will run from Friday,
May 19 through Monday,
May 22.

1e Patisserie

With students bored with cam-

variety.

Look no further than The Pa-

newest addition to its somewhat
limited selection of eateries. The
restaurant is open weekdays and

The owner and manager,
Kayla Finlay, along with The
Patisserie’s chef, Pennie Griﬂin
and baker, Higgins Stewart, were
former employees of Foods Inter-
national.

When this establishment
closed, these enterprising individ-
uals used their experience from
Foods International to create The
Patisserie. Finlay noticed that a
niche existed in the local mar-
ket for gourmet foods and baked
goods and fashioned the restau-
rant’s menu accordingly.

The Patisserie provides a wide

blanche and the selection changes
slightly everyday, the restaurant
always offers some basic items.
Turkey and roast beef sandwich-
es, as well as spinach and Greek
salads are typically available pre-
prepared.

Additionally, The Patisserie al-
ways offers two soups, both made
from scratch, one vegetarian.

Since the entrees are prepared
in advance, the longest a custom-
er will ever wait is two to three
minutes for their order.

Not only is this gourmet food
available quickly, but the prices
are reasonable. Sandwiches vary

between $4.95 and $7.95 and en-
trees prices range from $7.95 to
$12.95.

Of course, we cannot forget
about desserts.

The Patisserie offers a mouth-
watering array of treats, including
everything from traditional cin-
namon buns to baklava to ﬁlled
French croissants.

If you have the time, you can
savor your sweet in the comfort-
able, intimate environment while
surfing the Internet, since The Pa-
tisserie provides wireless Internet
on the premise.

Although The Patisserie does

not advertise heavily, its reputa-
tion has spreadimpressively sim-
ply by word of mouth.

Finlay reports that the restau-
rant has been serving 15 to 30
new customers every day since its
opening.

The atmosphere of The Patis-
serie is appropriate for a quick
bite or for an extended meal.

While The Patisserie may be
located in a rather unlikely place,
an old bowling alley that had to
be renovated and redesigned, this
little establishment is ﬂourish-
ing on the quality of its cuisine
alone.

Where the Buffalo roam

Bands from across the country will travel to the Buffalo Creek music festival to entertain the community

By Madeline Gent
su F r: w a IT 2 R

As spring term comes to a
close, the annual Washington
and Lee tradition of the Buffalo
Creek music festival kicks into
high gear.

This year’s festival includes
nine bands--four of which will
play on Friday and ﬁve on Sat-
urday.

Because of the recent ex-
plosion of the intemet web-
site Myspace, almost all the
band’s information as well as

Tickets are can be found
$10 and sold online.
online, in the Buffalo
Commons Creek follows
and can be on the footsteps
bought at the of Derby Days,
event Foxﬁelds and
tubing down

the Maury, as something every
student goes to at least once if
not each of the four years.

The festival has a great selec-
tion of music that is sure to tap
into a variety of musical tastes.

Playing Friday is Tom Ham-
ilton’s American Babies, Steel
Train, Brothers Past and Quag-
mire Swim Team. Brothers Past
is the Friday night headliner.

They come into the show af-
ter ending their year-long tour.
This summer their focus is on
special events, Buffalo Creek
being one of them.

“We’re going into summer

and just really working on new
material so special events are
last push for our album.” said
the band.

“Buffalo Creek has always
been a good ﬁt for us... Not
many things set up that we’re
tied to a university except
Washington and Lee and The
University of Vermont. We’ve
had tremendous time here last
two years and a good fan base.”

After playing here, Broth-
ers Past will go on to play
much larger music festivals like
Summer Camp, Wakarusa and
Bonnaroo.

This year will mark the
band’s third trip to Buffalo
Creek. Since then they have
found their amount of fans,
praise and coverage growing.

Glide Magazine wrote,
“Brothers Past focuses on the
art of songwriting in a unique
way that sets them apart from
the pack. When you combine
strong, well-written catchy
songs... with electronica laden
powerhouses... you get a de-
tailed glimpse into the future of
music.”

They play from 11:00 p.m.-
l:00 am. on Friday night.
Brothers Past manager Pete
Nicolosi calls the bands music
style describes the typical fan
as“anybody who likes live mu-
sic that might not typically be
heard on top 40.”

Nicolosi is also the manager
for the band playing the Friday
night Gazebo set 7:30 p.m.- 8:30
p.m., Tom Hamilton’s American
Babies.

The honor system
and alcoholism

Students who planned to pre-game the
trial have no respect for honor system

By Tim Llvlngston
surr warren

Last week many students
looked forward to witnessing the
ﬁrst honor trial at Washington and
Lee in years.

While some of the eager spec-
tators wished to behold a pivotal
moment in our school’s history
as well as a vital event in
the life of a student,
others had other mo-
tives to attend the
trial.

As rumors cir-
culated at the details
of the crime, several
individuals planned on
pre-gaming and going to
the hearing intoxicated.

As excitement grew at the
prospect of watching the accused
student on trial, I saw several
weaknesses within the structure
of our community of honor.

Immediately after every mem-
ber of the student body received
the email, few conversations
around our gossip-obsessed cam-
pus consisted of topics besides
the intricacies of the trial.

In theory, the student body
should attend the trial because of
an undying need to preserve the
sacred honor system our school
was built upon.

However, many of the students
who planned on going to the hear-
ing wanted to equate the experi-
ence to a college football game by
putting ten brews in their system
to make the rare occurrence truly
enjoyable.

Were these students making a
mockery of the honor system? Or
were the people who planned on
attending drunk simply epitomiz-
ing the average W&L student who
has to be inebriated in order to be
in a room with more than ﬁve fel-

low students?

Truthfully, I believe the reac-
tion of the student body demon-
strated a common belief in the
lack of importance the honor sys-
tem plays in everyday life.

For many students, the honor
system means virtually nothing
unless they are taking a test or
writing a paper.

The fact that people wanted

to attend Lee Chapel un-

der the inﬂuence re-

veals a truth that the

honor system plays

an increasingly

small role in stu-

dent’s lives as their

careers progress.

Aﬁer the ﬁrst

speech freshman year

when the EC president tells

all those who don’t believe they

can abide by the honor system to

“leave now,” freshman consider
the regulations sacred.

Yet, as time progresses, honor
fades in importance like the obli-
gation people feel when adhering
to the speaking tradition.

For many, the honor system
by the end of sophomore year is
merely a reason not to cheat, lie or
steal and be forced to submit to the
humiliation of the student who be-
came the laughingstock of W&L
before his or her tragic exit.

Students wanted to pre-game
the hearing because they could
not care less about the fate of the
indicted.

Why not get drunk to witness
a student face humiliation for
possibly breaking the hallowed
system? He or she made the criti-
cal mistake and many felt she de-
served embarrassment.

The question of what the hon-
or system really means to a major-
ity of the student body remains: is
it a way to govern one’s life, or a
way not to get expelled?

“Frankly the band would like
anyone who is a music lover,
who enjoys music, who likes
to dance, [and] who likes good
songwriting. We play music
with songs that have not such
silly lyrics but those that reso-
nate with people. People who
rock out,” said Nicolosi.

For anyone else who needs
more convincing they should
come out and watch Brothers
Past, the New York Press called
the band, “the square-jawed,
bastard child of Pink Floyd with
a gigantic stage show.”

Buffalo Creek and the band
have developed a good relation-
ship over the past years.

The Brothers Past plan on re-
turning as long as they are want-
ed. “We’re loyal to the people
who followed us when we were
a smaller band.”

The vibe, weather and fans
have worked together in the past
to create a great set that a true
music fan will not want to miss.

Saturday will not disap-
point either as Mayhem String
Band, Steam Powered Airplane,
Hackensaw Boys, The Pnuma
Trio and Perpetual Groove play
throughout the day.

The Pavilion Headliner is
Perpetual Groove playing from
10:00 p.m.- 2:00 a.m.

Perpetual Groove, like Broth-
ers Past, is hitting up the musi-
cal festival scene this summer.

Along with Buffalo Creek
they will be playing at Wakarusa
as well as 10,000 Lakes Music
Fest, JamCruise and moe.down

“As I awoke on Saturday, my
ﬁrst thought was of who would

blowing my head off tonight.
That honor went to the touring
juggernaut known as Perpetual
Groove,” said J_amBase.com
writer Brian Bavosa in his re-
view of New York City’s ﬁrst

N.’ GRA

annual Green Apple Music Fes-
tival.

The band was “the last spot
and summed up the week nice-
ly... (and) had my tired bones
boogying.” “

Another band taking the stage
on Saturday for the Pavilion set
from 7:30 p.m.- 9:30 p.m. is the
Pnuma Trio.

They too are making the
rounds this summer and can
again be found at Wakarusa as
well as Smilefest and Summer
Camp.

The band is only a year old

and claims,\/irginia as its home..

.“Described as a sound com-

bining dance music with tra-
ditional jazz driven by funk
sensibilities, the band is taking
multiple scenes by storm,” said
the bands site.

Whether you go to listen to
music, burn an old couch or sit
in a creek all day, Buffalo Creek
proves to be another tradition
among traditions here at W&L.

It gives the students access
to both lesser and better known
bands creating a way for ev-
eryone to expand their musical
palettes.

The festival is open to every-
one and always proves to be a
good time.

Nine teams participated on Saturday in a three-on-three basketball tourna-

organization assisting injured soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. “After 9/11,

I was very temped to join the military, but instead I went to college,” sopho-

said the fraternity dedicated the event to his high school friend, Eli, who died

McHugh and Craig Sauers donated their prize money to the cause.

Alternate athletics actively welcome new members

Washington and Lee offers a host of oppor-

tunites in the realm of club sports including

Washington and Lee’s Fenc-
ing Club is wrapping up a suc-
cessful season under new coach
and professor Daniel Turkeltaub.
The team has 30-40 members and
continues to grow.

“The Washington and Lee
Fencing Club has doubled in num-
bers since my freshman year, both
in membership and the number of
people attending practices,” ju-
nior captain Alejandro Selin said.

The club practices year-round:
three weekdays, for two hours,
and on Saturday for bouting prac-
tice. It also participates in several
tournaments with colleges such as
Hollins, Virginia Military Institute
and University of Virginia.

According to Selin, “W&L
has never failed to achieve ﬁrst
or second place in intercollegiate
tournaments.”

According to freshman mem-
ber Sean Hurdiss, it is not only a

good physical workout but a men-
tal one as well.

“Fencing has been called
physical chess because it requires
a sharp mind and well-trained
body,” he said.

While some students have
joined with prior experience, the
team welcomes all newcomers.

Since the end of winter term,
the W&L’s Club Women’s La-
crosse team has been practicing.
Fifteen girls are participating, and
the team encourages newcomers
to come out.

Freshman swimmer Amber
Butyn recently joined the team
having little previous experience.

“It’s cool to broaden my inter-
ests and learn a new sport,” she
said.

The girls practice twice a
week, for an hour and a half each
time. A typical practice includes
drills, sprints and scrimmaging.

Due to weather complications,
the team has yet to show its skills.
The tournament in District of Co-

lumbia the women were sched-
uled to play in was cancelled due
to thunderstorms. With the season
concluding, lacrosse player Alden
Wicker said she hopes it turns out
better next year.

WATER POLO

The W&L Club Water Polo
team has struggled to maintain a
regular practice schedule this sea-
son and has yet to compete in an
official match.

Currently, the team consists
of 10 to 12 members. The team is
open to both men and women and
is comprised largely of varsity
swimmers.

Practices are scheduled Mon-
days, Wednesdays and Thursdays
from 5:15 p.m.-6:15 p.m.

According to sophomore mem-
ber Ben Jaskiewicz, he is trying to
get the team more organized.

He also said head coach Joel
Shinoﬁeld is in the process of
organizing a tournament with
James Madison University next
fall before the swim season com-
mences.

Jaskiewicz formed a club team
with one of his friends as a junior
in high school. He also played as
a freshman in college last year in
California.

“It’s a fun sport,” he said.
“That’s why I went to Califomia-
to play polo. It’s a team sport like
baseball, but at the same time, it’s
agressive like football or rugby.”

The team welcomes any new
interest. Previous experience is
not required.

on national rank. The top 32
singles players in the nation are
invited along with the top 16
doubles teams. Applegate and
McClung along with Tabb and
Wortham will represent W&L on
Saturday in doubles play. Apple-
gate and Tabb each earned a spot
in singles as well.

Wortham, who will compete in
both team and individual competi-
tion said she is trying not to focus
too much on upcoming matches.

“I’m taking it one match at a
time,” she said. “I don’t want to
look ahead. This is why you prac-
tice hard. This is why you play
hard. This is why we compete.
This is why I play, for opportuni-
ties like these.”

The Generals, currently unde-
feated (26-0), will meet their ﬁrst
opponent, ninth ranked Williams
(14-6), Wednesday at 9:30 a.m.
at the University of California,
Santa Cruz. If the women defeat
Williams, they will play either
Claremont-Scripps-Mudd Col-
lege (18-3) or DePauw University
(24-1) in the semiﬁnals on Thurs-
day. Emory University ( 1 6-6) won
the title last year and are currently
ranked ﬁfth. Trinity University of
Texas (19-3) may prove to be the
ﬁercest competition, ranked sec-
ond in the nation.

Tabb said one of the most
greatest inﬂuences to bring home
the title is each player’s commit-
ment to the team.

“I think this year especially,
we’ve done a fabulous job at step-
ping up,” she said. “I think this is
our year to step up in the ﬁnals
and play hard and ﬁnally win it.
This is our time.”

Playoff drive cut short

Women ’s lacrosse ends promising crusade Saturday with fall to Lions

By Madeline Gent
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee wom-
en’s lacrosse team ended its best
season to date with a 16-6 loss
to The College of New Jersey in
second round play of the NCAA
Division III Championships.

The team ended with its high-
est overall record of 16-4.

The Generals began their play
in the NCAA tournament with a
19-9 victory over the Christopher
Newport Lady Captains in the
ﬁrst round on Watt Field.

Senior captains Amanda
Strickler and Kate Lester and
junior Kelly Evans scored three
goals apiece. Sophomore goalie
Sarah Tilbor recorded 13 saves,
but it was Strickler’s performance

that stood out most in the match
up. On top of her three goals, she
recorded four assists.

“It was our last home game,
and we really wanted to win for
our seniors... It was also the ﬁrst
time that [the Lady Captains] had
made it into the NCAA playoffs,
so they didn’t know what to ex-
pect. We wanted to show them
what it was all about,” said junior
midﬁelder Mallory Lobisser. She
ﬁnished the game with one goal.

The momentum of their victo-
ry over the Lady Captains did not
prove enough to tackle the The
College of New Jersey in Salis-
bury, Md., on Saturday.

The Lions entered with a nine-
game win streak, 12 previous
NCAA Division III championship
titles and 22 previous tournament

appearances.

Sophomore midﬁelder Megan
Slosson led the Generals’ ﬁrst
half performance with two goals.
Despite her performance, the
Generals found themselves on the
bottom half of the 5-2 score going
into the break.

The Generals were optimis-
tic at the start of the second half,
but were hit hard when Tilbor
received a yellow card. Fresh-
man goalie Ali Hillyard had to
step into goal lacking the experi-
ence of Tilbor. To that point, she
had faced 282 shots. In the seven
games Hillyard played, she faced
only 38 shots. Hillyard recorded
two saves in her 14:27 of play.

The Lions outscored the Gen-
erals 11-4 in the second half.
They were led by senior midﬁeld-

ers Bridget Bigley and Lauren
Dougher, scoring two goals each.
Bigley also had three assists as
her nine-point performance ranks
ﬁfth all-time for single—game
point totals. Dougher adds her six
goals to a total of 41 in touma-
ment play, which ranks fourth for
the most goals scored in NCAA
tournament action.

“Our defense played re-
ally well. We tried to shut down
Dougher, but they had shots we
weren’t prepared for and couldn’t
defend,” Lobisser said.

Freshman Kelsi Robinson ﬁn-
ished the game with two goals.
Strickler had two assists.

“Our ﬁve seniors played their
hearts out, but they just ﬁnished
a lot better than we did,” Lobisser
said.

Seven women leave for Cali-
fornia today with a chance to make
history for the ,Washington and
Lee women’s tennis team. Cruis-
ing through the ﬁrst two rounds
of Nationals held last weekend
at home, these women hope to
clinch the title that has eluded
them for the past two years.

Freshman Katie Tabb was re-
cently declared Atlantic South
Rookie of the Year with a singles
record of 23-5 and a doubles re-
cord of 24-5. She said the team’s
main motivation is its commit-
ment to one another.

“We know we can depend on
one another,” she said. “We all
know we are committed and seri-
ous. I think that’s really important
for doing well, knowing that your
team mates are there and working
just as hard as you.”

Last Saturday, the Generals de-
feated Mary Washington, ranked
twenty—ﬁrst in the nation, 5-0. An
identical performance Sunday
versus number 12 Carnegie Mel-
lon left nothing but hunger in the
hearts of these women.

Saturday, decisive wins from
juniors Emily Applegate and
Kristen McClung, Tabb and ju-
nior Ginny Wortham and senior
Lisa Mabry and sophomore Leah
Weston in doubles placed the
Generals on top going into the
singles matches. Applegate and
Tabb handled their opponents
with ease, securing victory over

Mary Washington.

On Sunday, Applegate and
McClung played number one
doubles, defeating their CMU op-
ponents 8-6. Tabb and Wortham
followed in number two doubles
with a duplicate score. Compet-
ing in number three doubles,
Weston and Mabry tripled the
success with a score of 8-4. In
singles competition, Applegate
and Weston cleared the courts
with their victories over their
CMU contenders guaranteeing a
plane ticket to Santa Cruz for the
next rounds of Nationals.

Tabb said coach Cinda Rankin
was collected as she led the team
to victory.

“I think Cinda was actually a
little nervous, but she did a good
job not showing it,” she said.
“She was not overconﬁdent, but
she wanted us to be comfortable
and ready to play going into the
ﬁrst couple of rounds.”

Nationals is divided into two
competitions: team and individ-
ual. The ﬁrst, beginning Wednes-
day, will determine each school’s
national standing. The second
tournament begins Saturday to
establish individual status. Apple-
gate, Tabb, Wortham, McClung,
Weston and sophomores Rebecca
Timmis and Kelly Will com-
pete in the quarterﬁnals opening
Wednesday.

Four Generals were chosen
to participate in the individual
tournament. Selection is based
