Srebrenica

rememberance

Ten years. after the United
Nations abandoned the
town of Srebrenica to
Serbian’ murder squads,
the W&L community re-
members the atrocity with‘
an exhibit in Leybuin Li-
brary. On Tuesday, Janu-

‘ any 3 1 st and Tuesday,

February 7th documenta-
ries about the tragedy will
be shown in the library’s
Northen auditorium. The
first film shown will be
“Srebrenica: A Cry from
the Grave,” and the sec-
ond will be “Calling the
Ghosts: A Story of Rape,
Women, and War.” Both
ﬁlms begin at 7pm.

corrections

Last week’s article,
“Why Dr. Comel West
matters,” incorrectly
quoted Harvard Presi-
dent Larry Summers,
who did not say “there
are ‘issues of intrinsic
aptitude’ separating men
and women.” Summers
actually said there is a
“different availability of
aptitude at the high end”
of science professions.

Administration considers serious alterations to W&L residential life

Despite student indifference to W&L’s new Strategic Plan initiatives, serious changes to the

university’s housing situation could be coming soon. While many of the proposals may not

be adopted, several have the potential to radically alter housing both on campus and off.

By Melissa Caron
STAFF WRITER

Much talk in recent months has
evolved around the proposed
Strategic Plan, a series of
proposals that look to change or
rework various facets of the
school’s community. One area of
considerable interest involves the
recommended changes to student
housing that the plan covers.

“It is safe to say that there has
been a strong interest to improve
housing,” said Joseph Grasso,
Vice President of Administration.
Grasso served as campus chair for
the Capital and Space Planning
Task Force, which was one of the
several groups responsible for
compiling a report of suggestions
for the plan.

Grasso points out that the most
recent major renovation to have
taken place was in 1987 and
involved the construction of
Gaines Hall. While smaller
projects have taken place in the
years since, he notes that the next

generation of projects will
probably be much larger in scale.

“The nature of the next
renovation will focus on such
things as air conditioning and
common spaces for students,”
Grasso said. “Both of those will
require significant structural
changes.”

Provost Thomas Williams, co-
chair of the Consolidation
Committee, which is responsible
for going over and compiling a
ﬁnal plan from the suggestions
that came out of the different task
forces, points out that much of
what is proposed for residential
life involves improving the
condition of existing buildings.

“I don’t believe we have any
serious safety concerns,”
Williams said. “But modern
buildings are safer.”

The administration hopes that
by improving residential life,
Washington and Lee will be at a
better competitive level with other
schools when it comes to
attracting the best and brightest
students to the campus. Similarly,

as Williams points out, modern
buildings will be more energy
efficient, something very
important to consider with rising
fuel prices.

Greeks review plans

While it is hard to argue that
the dorms are not in need of
renovation, other elements of the
plan have proven to be more
controversial.

“In general I liked a lot of the
ideas, but felt that sometimes they
were trying to move the school in
the direction of other schools and
address issues they had,” junior
Nadia Prinz said. “Students on the
committee seemed to be more
concerned with the preservation
of the W&L identity.”

Prinz served on the Greek
Strategic Plan Review
Committee, a student run group
that was called together to read
and discuss the’ strategic plan and

BEHIND
BARS

Here’s to laughing at the
expense of those who ran
afoul of the law during the
\last few weeks. News editor
Jacob Geiger took a peek
at this week’s police reports
to see what you’ve been up
to. Though Behind Bars
has only one W&L arrest to
report, an interesting mix of
local residents and out-of-
town visitors kept the po-
lice busy over the last few
weeks. Don ’t worry, only

initials were printed.

Late night?

Or an early morning?
Twenty-two year old MB
was arrested early — well,
not that early — on Satur-
day, January 8"‘. Records
from the Lexington Police
Department indicate that

  
 

MB was booked at 5:17
AM that morning. 5:17!
Now that must have been
one hoppin’ late night
party. The weekend was
unusually quiet due to Pan—
Hellenic’s pre—rush no con-
tact, but there was still
enough going on for MB
to run into trouble.

One way red ux

As discussed in the last is-
sue of Behind Bars,
Lexington’s warren of one ‘
way streets can be confus-
ing at times. They’re even
more difficult to navigate
if the driver is drunk. GW,
age thirty—eight, was
stopped while traveling the
wrong way on a one way
street at 1:15 AM on Janu-
ary 12”‘. Adding insult to
injury, GW, who was ar-
rested for driving under
the inﬂuence, was also
cited for failing to use his
headlights.

No darling, you may
not borrow my car
Lexington resident TN was
also arrested on January
12"‘ for a driving offense.
The thirty-eight year old
was charged with “unau-
thorized use of a vehicle,”
a felony offense. TN is re-
ported to have taken her
father’s car without his per-
mission. Behind Bars won-
ders what’s worse: being
charged with a felony after
taking your father’s car or
the major grounding that
seems sure to follow.

A long litany

of poor decisions
Quiet Lexington usually
sees just one or two felony
charges each month. Last
Tuesday, however, JP of
Buena Vista managed to
rack up ﬁve charges by
himself. Four of the
charges are listed were
“attempt[s] to maliciously

wound,” while the ﬁfth
was for a hit-and—run with
property damage greater
than one thousand dollars.
Not content with the five
felony counts, JP picked
up two serious misde-
meanor charges: domestic
assault and battery along
with violating a protective
order. The entire incident
occurred shortly before
midnight; Officer
Kesterson made the arrest
at 11:45. By the time the
booking was completed,
Lexington’s felony count
for January had more than
doubled.

Mind Your Manners
Freedom of speech only
goes so far in Lexington,
as one local resident dis-
covered last week. A 10-
cal woman was cited for
cursing in public. Loud-
mouthed frat boys, watch
the f-bombs.

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1

to report back to their
chapters about what was
discussed.

One such element that has met
heated debate from both sides
involves the possibility of
creating learning communities
within the residential buildings.
Halls would be organized based
upon academic interests and a
couple faculty members would
live in the dorms in order to
engage students in social and
intellectual discussion.

Grasso points out that the aim
of this would be to bolster the
academic program.

Prinz says that this aspect of
the plan met a lot of criticism
from the student committee and
others outside of it, and she feels
that it probably won’t be
included in the final plan.

“It is antithetical to the whole
liberal arts education,” Prinz
said. “You have the rest of your
life to be with people in your
field.”

Reverse exodus

Another area that has met
some opposition is whether or
not upper—classmen should live
on campus. Currently many
juniors and seniors live off
campus in apartments or houses
that either they or their Greek
organization rent. Suggestions
under the plan have included
improving the condition of
current on—campus residencies,
thereby increasing their appeal
to upperclassmen, or having
upperclassmen live in the Greek
houses.

Williams says that while they
do recognize that many people
are interested in maintaining the

tradition of living off campus, he
feels that there are many beneﬁts
for having juniors and seniors on
campus and even in the fraternity
and sorority houses.

“There is still some
discussion, but it is not currently
driven by a desire to house more
upperclassmen but driven more
by whether having juniors and
seniors living in the house will
provide greater leadership
potential,” Williams said.

Community effects

One thing that was considered
when this proposal came up in
committee was the effect a
massive housing shift would
have on the economy‘ of the
town, since many students rent
right off campus.

“The University tries to be
careful and not compete with the
local economy,” Williams said.

 felt that sometimes they were trying to move

the school in the direction of other schools and

address issues they had.”
-NADIA PRINZ, CLASS OF 2007

“However, one serious concern
is the condition of some of the
rental units. There are some
safety concerns.”

Safety concerns

Williams describes their plan
as more market driven than
anything. He says that the
campus recognizes that there is
a student market for housing.
Some students are dissatisfied
with their housing in town, and
he feels that by building better

housing on campus the school is
only encouraging the market to
improve. It would ultimately be
the students’ decisions of
whether or not to live on campus.

Grasso also points out that
building better housing on
campus will conuibute to greater
safety in the community,
especially for those living out in
the country.

“There are some safety
concerns for students when they
live 15 or so miles out on a windy

  Debate on housing heats up

road and they still have classes
on a snowy day,” Grasso said.

Looking ahead

The strategic plan is currently
being looked at by the
Consolidation Committee,
whose job is to consider the
recommendations given by the
assigned task forces and various
other committees and to consider
what criticisms came out of such
meetings. They will begin to
piece together and prioritize all
the information into a final
report.

Grasso feels that as the
university approaches this step of
the process it is important for
student involvement.

“What do students want?”
Grasso said. “We need to do a
better job in understanding what
students want for housing
alternatives.”

5:00 PM . 5:00 PM George Washington, playing

one of the most surprising teams
in the country. With convincing

Their strong backcourt presence,

The University of

Penn is a team that is ready to be

Football 101

The Super Bowl is rapidly approaching, and there are parties to be planned and

food to be prepared. But the fun of the Super Bowl is lost if you don ’t know what is

going on in the game. So for everyone who wants to be able to understand the best

game ever played or needs a quick refresher on the rules, here is a simple summary

of the objective of the game.

The game

Football is played by two
teams with eleven guys each on
a 120-yard long ﬁeld. The ob-
ject is to move the ball down
the ﬁeld, either by passing or
running it. The team must ad-
vance the ball 10 yards in the
direction of the opponent’s end
zone. They have four chances
(or downs) to accomplish this.
Otherwise, the ball is turned
over to the other team. When
the end zone is reached, a
touchdown is scored. If the
team feels that they cannot
reach the end zone, they have
the option of kicking a field
goal, which, if successful, will
count for three points.

Key terms

Quarterback: the gentleman
who does most of the passing.
It is unacceptable to call him
the point guard, the pitcher, or
the guy with the tight pants.
Stick to quarterback or QB.

Secondary: the defensive
players who line up behind the
defensive linemen.

Special teams: this refers to
the players who are on the ﬁeld
during a kickoff, punt, extra

point attempt or ﬁeld goal.

Turnover: when a team loses
possession of the football be-
cause of a fumble or intercep-
tion, they have committed a
turnover.

Flag on the play: when a pen-
alty is assessed, the referee
throws a yellow ﬂag to signal
that a rule has been broken.

First and seven: the team has
four chances, or downs, to ad-
vance the ball ten yards. The
first number refers to what try
they are on, and the second
number indicates how many
yards they have to go.

Red zone: this is the area in-
side the opponents’ twenty yard
line when the team with the
ball is close to scoring.

Running the option: this is a
play in which the QB has the
option of running, or, if he does
not see a hole opening up, he
may pitch it to his running
back, who follows just behind
him.

Line of scrimmage: this is the
line where the two teams line
up to begin each play. The
football is placed here before
the play starts.

Snap: this signals the begin-
ning of the play. The center
lineman hikes the ball between
his legs into the waiting hands
of the QB. Yes, it is awkward
positioning, but that is better
left unmentioned.

Blitz: this occurs when addi-
tional defenders attempt to
break through the offensive
line to tackle the quarterback.

Tackle/Sack: the ball carrier
must be forced down, or tack-
led to end a play. When a QB
is tackled behind the line of
scrimmage, this is called a
sack.

Hail Mary: when time is 11111-
ning out and a team is desper-
ate for points, they can throw a
long, high pass with the hopes
of connecting with a wide re-
ceiver for a score. Not always
successful, but always exciting.

Lip Synch raises money for charity while entertaining the student body

The Pavilion rocked to the beat of musical

hits and the noise of a screaming crowd of

students interested in fun and philanthropy.

By Jessica Shaw
STAFF WRITER

 

' The beat of Michael
Jackson’s hit, "I‘hril1er’
shook the Pavilion Friday
night as freshman Sandile
Khumalo and six of his
pledge brothers took the
stage.

' The building came alive
as students and faculty
stomped to the beat, bel-
lowing the words and
wildly shouting their ap-
provals. As the night pro-
gressed, hits like ‘Barbie
Girl’, ‘Yeah’, and ‘Discov-
ery Channel’ blasted as
groups competed for the
coveted Lip Synch title.

At this twentieth annual
performance, 25 groups
choreographed acts to raise
money for Students Against
Rockbridge Area Hunger
(S.A.R.A.H.).

Hosts of the competition
and officers of S.A.R.A.H.,
juniors Chris Lalli and
Pierce Owings were decked
out in outrageously shiny,
red jackets as they comi-
cally censored the show.

“I would have to say
that my favorite part of the
night is being on stage and

being able to act like a fool,
yet know that I am doing it
for a good cause,” Lalli
said.

These officers are also
in charge of selecting the
judge panel for Lip Synch,
comprised mostly of fac-
ulty members.

According to Lalli, they
try to select judges that
many students will recog-
nize including a member
from the EC. The judges
are responsible not only for
evaluating the acts, but also
for maintaining an appro-
priate presence on stage.

Students _forked over
ticket money to see many
of their friends get gonged
off stage for promiscuous
dancing or drunken stupid-
ity.
By the end of the night,
numerous acts had been cut
short due to lewd behavior.
Despite this judicial
‘power’, the audience wit-
nessed an excess of thongs,
speedos and spandex.

“Even though a number
of people were drunk, the
event in itself was awe-
some,” Khumahlo said.
“Some skits were quite gro-
tesque, but I guess different

groups of people have dif-
ferent defmitions of fun.”

This year, Phi Psi’s
‘Thriller’ performance
claimed the ﬁrst place title.
According to group mem-
ber and freshman Brad
Bender, practices began at
least a week and a half
ahead of time.

Bender said the group
watched the Michael Jack-H
son video for reference,
and freshman Carson
Bruno altered some of the
more challenging moves.

Other group members
were freshmen Allan
Kisoma, Mike Kazior, Ben
Hoagland and Emerson
Bluhm.

This entertaining perfor-
mance was followed
closely by the second MSA
group that captured second
place.

The crowd raved about
their four-song combina-
tion choreographed by se-
niors Ashlee Metcalf,
Kristen Youngblood,
Kristin Evans and Kynai
Johnson.

After receiving second

- place, group member and

senior Julian Ledford said
he was very excited about
the act.

“I was proud of the la-
dies, and I could see that
they were pleased,” he said.
“It was a great feeling to
hear the crowd cheering for

MSA.”

‘Diamonds are a Girl’s
Best Friend’, performed by
the’ third Theta group,
awarded them third place in
the competition. This styl-
ish, jazzy ensemble was
choreographed mainly by
freshman Jennifer Lysenko.
These six Theta girls pulled
off a unique, creative per-
formance that left the
judges rocking in their
seats.

Group leader Lysenko
said, “I think we all added
something to the choreog-
raphy in the end. We had a
lot of personality in our
group, which made it fun.”

“I feel like it’s a great
way for the school to bond
and have a sense of com-
munity,” said sophomore
Alice Shih, who was a
member of last year’s win-
ning group. “It’s also won-
derful that it’s for charity.”

Thousands of dollars
earned each year from this
event are donated to local
food banks by S.A.R.A.H.
officers and their advisor
John Taffe. According to
Lalli, they have not re-
ceived the amount of the
total earnings from this
weekend yet.

Ledford said, “Lip Sync,
like lots of things on this
campus, is becoming a tra-
dition, and it is one that
students want to keep.”

THE RING-TUM PHI - 7

 

editorial

Lip servic

Does Lip Synch’s positive goal justify its debauchery?

Tackling the subject of stu-
dent——particularly underage stu-
dent——drinking is always danger-
ous.

But when it’s up on stage, in _

front of a large portion of the stu-
dent population (and some fac-

V ulty and community members,

too) it seems impossible to ig-
nore.

Part of the tradition of Lip
Synch is about putting together
an act as a team, and perform-
ing to an audience who paid ad-
mission in order to raise money
for charity. ’

The other part involves clan-
destine meetings in the bathroom
and a ﬂask.

Of course, this is all conjec-
ture on the Phi’s part, but let’s
be serious: underage drinking
runs rampant at Lip Synch.

This may not be much differ-
ent than any other frat party. The
administration has rules, and you
don’t see many kids with beer
cans or liquor bottles out in the
audience in the Pavilion.

It’s what you can’t see that
makes the difference.

The‘ pre—parties, the ﬂasks,
the water bottles filled with-—
well, it isn’t water.

After years of Lip Synch—ing
to new lows, the powers—that—be
must know about this——so why
haven’t they done anything
about it?

To the Editor:
I was deeply troubled when I
read the recent staff editorial
about sexual assault. One line of
the editorial, which you saw fit
to print in large, italicized font,
was the following: “Suggestive
actions, provocative dancing,
and revealing dress are never
excuses for rape, but if sexual
assault is going to be eliminated,
women must be ladies and men
must be gentlemen.” I argue that
not only are the three items you
list not excuses for rape, but they
do not even enter the universe
of relevant factors when assign-
ing responsibility. In fact, sexual
assault is not “a double-edged
sword,” as you write, but instead
a crime with a perpetrator and a
victim. The perpetrator is the
party who bears all of the guilt.
Rape is a violent crime which
does not happen by accident.
Rape victims should not be held
culpable in any way for the trau-
matic violation from which they
have suffered. By implying that
women’s clothes, dancing, and
“suggestive actions” play any
role at all in the occurrence of
rape, Ring—Tum Phi editors only
create an environment in which
women will be less willing to

speak out about sexual assault.

a ton of dough for SARAH,
which in turn fills the area pan-
tries with this one event.

Cracking down on the alco-
hol consumption at this event
would indubitably hurt both at-
tendance and participation.

The administration probably
couldn’t do much about it any-
way. In a school where fraternity
houses having no members over
the age of 21 can get an alcohol
permit, it’s hard to imagine some
kind of strict regulation of alco-
hol consumption.

Catching a few more kids in
the act of being kids would not
likely be worth the losses SA-
RAH would suffer.

Lip Synch has other positive
elements as well.

It’s one of the first activities
many pledge classes perform to-
gether, and, in that sense, helps
build morale for the “team.”

There’s also some excitement
in it. Getting up in front of so
many people, doing well (or not)
and being blatantly drunk but not
getting in trouble-—it’s enough to

Junior questions ethics

To the editor: ‘
Yesterday I decided to
pick up a Ring~tum Phi and
was disgusted at your, ‘Be-
hind Bars,’ section. During
the preamble I was hoping
that 3 humor article would
follow, maybe an anecdotal
account of Rush Week-or
Tear Night highlights. In-
stead, I found alow-brow
account of arrests, written
with a srnarrny sarcasm that
begs a few questions of its
author. Have you ever made
a mistake, or gotten in
trouble? Have you ever com»
mitted such a life altering of-
fense as a DUI? The conde-
scending toneof your piece
would suggest that you’ve
walked the straight and nar-
row since you first stood, and
maybe you have. But if you
haven’t, then remernberback
to a time when you screwed
up, plain and simple. Then
imagine if you had to answer
not just to the law, but also
to Washington and Lee.
I You exposed two students
who received DUIs. Without
any knowledge of the Law
SchooI’s policy, I can tell you
that the undergrad will likely
have to leave school for at
least a semester, in addition

to tliousands of dollars in’

fines and fees. {fail to see the
I « humor. Also, I used the word

make adrenaline swell your
veins.

Many students would not
have the nerve to get up in front
of the school and dance around
without the aid of a little barley
and hops.

Are the actions of drunk stu-
dents different than those of so-
ber ones? '

Absolutely.

But everyone——drunk or so-
ber-—was thoroughly entertained
(or appalled) by it.

Lip Synch is one of the few
“cool” activities at this school at
which attendance is not divided
down Greek lines. It’s also one
of the‘ few activities held by the
school that students actually at-
tend.

Sad as it is, alcohol brings us
together for this good cause. It
may not seem right, but taking
alcohol away‘from Lip Synch
would be the same thing as tak-
ing food out of those pantries.

The above editorial repre-
sents the majority opinion of The
Ring-Tum Phi editorial staﬁ‘I

exposed for good reason.
I When possible, you used the
person’s initials and home-
town. This makes it simple
for teachers, alums, or pap
ents who’re familiar with the
student to recognize them in
your article. If you feel.it’s
your journalistic duty to
keep our community abreast
of who got arrested then
keep at it, but I think you
might want to reconsider-
your section.
‘Laughing at the ex-
penseji of those who’re
awaiting punishment from
the school and county isn’t
journalism, it’s petty slander. ‘
If your aim is to reduce the
Phi to a tabloid, smearing
W&L students, so be it. But
you might want to seek coun-
se} of the former News Edi-
tors. The Phi used to pride '
themselves on being the se
rious, credible arm of stu-
dent pubs. As a former News
Editor for The Trident, I of-
ten struggled with how to fill ,
my section, some weeks
were just lean on -news.
However, I never resorted to
A pot—shots at classmates when

You’re still a freshmen.
For your sake, I hope neither

Rushing here, there

Pi Phi compares rush week at UVA té ours at W&L

By Kate Shellnutt
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s chapter
of Pi Beta Phi got a chance to see
another campus’ rush week when
they visited the University of Vir-
ginia Saturday for a mixer.

Unlike at W&L, UVA’s frater-
nity rush incorporates women,
whose formal recruitment there
ended the week before.

Because fraternities and sorori-
ties conduct recruitment during
separate weeks, UVA has no col-
lective celebration analogous to
W&L’s Tear Night.

At UVA, fraternity rush takes
place over two weeks and is di-
vided into three rounds of invita-
tions. Fratemitics will invite rush-
ees to “a series of formal events,”
including dinners, date functions
and mixers.

“Girls will have to dress up as
and go to ‘invites’ with their boy-
friends or guy friends.” said Missy

Jenkins, a UVA sophomore. “On
top of wonying about what frater-
nities you’re going to, ﬁnding a
date seems to be additionally
stressful for the freshmen rush-
ing.”

Despite this stress, freshmen
and upperclassmen fraternity
members enjoy the date aspect.

“Everyone gets really excited,”
said Zach Roth, :1 UVA second-
year and one of Chi Psi’s rush
chairs.

He helped organize the mar-
riage-themed mixer between his
fraternity and Pi Phi.

In contrast to the separate re-
crultment activities for men and
women at W&L, the visiting Pi
Phis immediately noticed differ-
ences in the party-oriented rush
process at UVA.

“It didn’t even seem like rush.
There was no Visible difference
between the guys that were rush-
ing and the brothers,” said Jill
Roper, sophomore. “Yeah, it

shows the true side of the frater-
nity, but it also seems to use girls
to bribe. freshmen.”

Roper continued to explain
how this system may be “unique
to UVA.” *

“At W&L,. we have Homecom-
ing, we have Christmas Weekend,
we have tons of mixers, so rush
shouldbe rush,” she said. “I think
it would be difficult to do rush like
this because of all the people who
rush as freshmen here.”

Not only does UVA have 31
IFC fraternities, but also, only
30% of the freshman population
goes through rush.

Despite differences in popula-
tion, Pi Phi sophomore Jamie

Ferrell said the UVA Greek scene
.had a familiar feel. A

“Walking around Charlottes-
ville, you see all these kids walk-
ing to fraternity houses, just like
in Lexington,” she said. “The
mixer with Chi Psi was just so
much fun.”
