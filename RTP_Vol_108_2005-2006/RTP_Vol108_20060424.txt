Sitting with Jeb

Students from Florida State
University, Florida A&M Uni-
versity and Tallahassee Com— .
munity College wrapped up

a 33 hour sit-in at Governor
Jeb Bush’s ofﬁce to protest the
death of 14-year-old Martin
Lee Anderson. Anderson died
after being beaten by security
guards at the juvenile boot
camp he had been sent to.
Last Friday Al Sharpton and
Jesse Jackson joined Ander-
son’s parents and the student
protesters in a march at the
capital. Anderson’s parents
and the protesters are calling
for action; 105 days have now
elapsed since their son died.
Gov. Bush ordered a sec-

ond autopsy performed on
Anderson’s body; the original
one said the 14-year-old died
of a sickle cell trait. Prelimi-
nary results from the second
autopsy appear to indicate An-
derson did not die of natural
causes. No arrests have been
made in the case.

Cops feeling foxy
This weekend’s Foxﬁeld
Races will be patrolled by
over 200 ofﬁcers from vari-
ous Virginia police agencies.
Plainclothes and uniformed
cops from the Virginia ABC
department, the Albemarle Po-
lice Department and Virginia
State Police will be patrolling
the event site and taking a no
tolerance policy. The depart-
ments will be monitoring race
visitors when they arrive,
checking for signs of intoxica-
tion or indications of underage
drinking. Anyone found to be
in violation of Virginia alco-
hol laws will not be allowed
into the race area.

I-81 expansion
Debate continues over the
proposed expansion of I-81.
Officials from the Virginia
Department of Transporta-
tion have been hosting public
meetings up and down the
I-81 corridor, which includes
Lexington. Some proposals
involve creating “truck only”
lanes, while others would
make the highway a toll road
for cars and trucks. The col-
lected tolls would help pay
for the cost of the interstate’s
repair and expansion. Op-
ponents of the expansion say
it will destroy the Shenandoah
Valley’s beauty and dramati-
cally increase air pollution.
One other proposal calls for
the expansion of the area’s rail
corridor to reduce the amount
of truck traffic on I-81.

On Wednesday and Thurs-
day, April 26-27, students
can donate a portion of their
meal plan cost to the Cam— 4

Protests rock UVa

University police arrest seventeen students at living wage sit-in

Though University of Virginia President John

Casteen says he cannot fully change some staff

wages, students, faculty and staff continue to

protest outside the school’s Madison Hall, say-

ing workers should make $10.72 per hour.

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

The arrest of seventeen Uni-
versity of Virginia students on
April 15 has brought intense con-
troversy and debate to the school’s
normally apolitical grounds. Stu-
dents arguing that the university
should pay higher wages to entry-
level staff staged a four day sit-
in at the school’s administration
building Madison Hall.

The sit-in began on Wednes-
day, April 12 and ended Saturday
evening when the students were
arrested by university police of-
ﬁcers. One faculty member was
also arrested for trespassing when
she tried to enter Madison Hall
early in the standoff. Each stu-
dent faces trespassing charges
and, if found guilty, could be
ﬁned $2,500 dollars or sentenced
to a year in jail.

The Washington Post, Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch, The Daily
Progress and other Virginia news-
papers have covered the protests
and debates extensively, and local
television stations have also been
spending time on the grounds of
UVa.

Todd Rosenbaum, a spokes-
man for the UVa Living Wage
Campaign, said the arrests will
not stop continuing student pro-
tests.

“We’re looking to keep public
pressure on John Casteen. This
movement started with 15 people
and has grown to over 500 hun-
dred. We’re looking to engage in
other forms of direct action and
will have more protests.”

The UVa students argue that
the university’s lowest paid em-
ployees need a salary of $10.72
per hour plus beneﬁts to live in
Charlottesville, where the school

has been located since it was
founded by Thomas Jefferson.
The university currently pays its
lowest salaried employees $9.37
per hour and says that other ben-
eﬁts, including health care, raise
the hourly wage to $12.66.

One of the students’ chief
complaints is that the university
employs a large number of con-
tract workers. Companies that
work with the university, includ-
ing food service provider Ara-
mark, are not required to pay the
$9.37 minimum wage.

In March the university asked
the Attorney General’s office if
the school could force contrac-
tors to pay certain wages. The
Attorney General replied that
the school did not have the legal
authority to impose a minimum
wage on their contractors.

Carol Wood, Assistant Vice
President for University Relations
and the school ’s spokeswoman on
the issue, said the school is con-
strained in its choice of contrac-
tors by the state’s Procurement
Act. K

“As a public institution 
we’re required, in most cases, to
take the lowest bid,” she said.

Rosenbaum disputed the
school’s assertion that they can-
not affect the contractors’ wages.
“The Attorney General’s opinion
is just that — an opinion. There’s
no legal precedent, and Alexan-
dria and Arlington have living
wage ordinances. We don’t think
the Attorney General will chal-
lenge them.

The city of Charlottesville
has a minimum hourly wage of
$9.36. George Mason University,
located in Fairfax, Virginia, has a
minimum wage of $10.40. That

Students examine gender relations

Gender Relations Committee plans special
barbeque and future upperclassmen luncheon

By Stacey Grljalva
STAFF WRITER

A common complaint of up-
perclassmen is that men and
women do not interact as much
as they did freshmen year.

One student group, the Gen-
der Relations Committee (GRC)
has decided to tackle the issue
head on.

“The GRC wants to give
students more opportunities to
hang out together on campus,
broadening their selection of
activities,” said Kristen Powell,
assistant director of student ac-
tivities.

On Tuesday, the GRC will
have a campus-wide volleyball
game along with a barbeque on
the Canaan Green. People can
either sign up to play or jump in
during a game.

Then in May, the fratemi-
ties and sororities will have a
chance to eat lunch together in
Evans Dining Hall.

On that day, the Greek houses
will not offer lunch for the day.
Instead upperclassmen can eat
in Evans, recreating the fresh-

men experience of guys and gals
eating and interacting in d-hall.

“It’s something different,”
said Powell. “It’s a chance to eat
with different folk.”

FIJI President Andrew
Rothey, who has been working
closely with the committee on
the luncheon, agreed that it was
a great opportunity.

“Everyone can take advan-
tage of it to eat as men and
women,” said Rothey. “You can
also eat with other fratemities or
people that you don’t see any-
more.”

In the past, students repeated-
ly brought up the idea of forming

an occasion for men and women
to eat together instead of sepa-
rating at lunchtime to eat at their
respective houses.

The idea came up at the Day
of Dialogue in both 2005 and
2006 and at the most recent
Greek Summit.

“[For upperclassmen,] it’s
not the same as when you were
a freshman and just had to go up
or down a ﬂoor to see the oppo-
site gender,” said Matthew Loar,
the incoming chair of GRC.

If this trial run of the lun-
cheon goes well and students
support the event, then co-ed
lunches may become a monthly

“Normal gender relations are a way to get to

know each other and talk when not intoxicated.

It can be a meal, a walk together or going to

the movies. How well can you know somebody

when you ’re drunk? ”

JAN KAUFMAN, Director of Health Promotions
 

opportunity next year.

The luncheon will be open to
all upperclassmen. For indepen-
dents, the meal can swiped.

One past function of the GRC
is Date Night.

At the most recent Date
Night, held in November, stu-
dents swiped home vouchers for
restaurants around town.

“Date Night was our most
popular event,” said Loar. “Ob-
viously people like the idea of a
date. There’s something roman-
tic about it.” '

In fact, Powell said that one
student told her that it was his
“ﬁrst real date.”

That’s great news for the
GRC, whose primary mission is
to improve gender relations on
campus.

“Normal gender relations are
a way to get to know each other
and talk when not intoxicated,”
said Jan Kaufman, Director of
Health Promotions.

“It can be a meal, a walk to-
gether or going to the movies,”
she said. “How well can you
know somebody when you’re
drunk?”

As part of its mission, the
GRC also focuses on sexual as-
sault on campus. A current proj-
ect is a comprehensive booklet
on sexual misconduct, includ-
ing what to do if it happens to

you, what to do if it happens to
a friend, information about con-
sent and statistics.

It will be given to incoming
freshmen but should be avail-
able to other students at matric-
ulation.

“Sexual assault is a big is-
sue,” said Loar. “It shouldn’t
happen as much as it does. The
hooking up culture fosters a lot
of the problems that lead to sex-
ual assault.”

By providing opportuni-
ties to interact without alcohol,
GRC hopes to reduce the high
number of sexual assaults at
Washington and Lee.

The results from a recent stu-
dent health survey will tell the
GRC how great an impact they
have had.

No matter the results, the
GRC will keep working to help
W&L students.

Jennifer Sayre, co-adviser of
GRC and school counselor, is
hopeful about the the changes
the committee will bring to
campus, mostly because the or-
ganization is student-run.

“It has been my experience
that most important changes at
W&L are student driven,” said
Sayre.

“When students become in-
volved and concerned, great
progress is made,” she said.

BHID
BARS

Here is the latest update on who
ran afoul of the law during the last
few weeks. We took a peek at this
weeks police reports to see what

you ’ve been up to...

 

DUls on the rise?
Wesley Whagner was ar-
rested and charged with a
DUI Sunday, March 26.
Whagner, who lives near
the Natural Bridge area,

. was stopped for driving 42

mph in a 25mph zone.

Mind the signs

Mark Cruciani, a resident of
Clarks Summit, Pennsylva-
nia, was arrested on Friday,
March 24. Cruciani was ar-
rested around 11:30pm out-
side of Malone’s restaurant.
He was charged with public
drunkenness and damage of
property less than $1000.
The responding ofﬁcer ar-
rived at the Palms, where

a person reported that Cru-
ciani was damaging property
at Malone’s. After exiting
the restaurant, Cruciani re-
portedly ripped a banner off
the side of the building and
began tearing it up. He then
kicked in a window on the
wall of the Malone’s build-
ing.

Double trouble

The residents of 106 Tay-
lor Street continue to have
problems with the police.
In December one person

was charged with a DIP and
another was charged with a
DUI on the same night. This
time Emmanuel Harris was
charged with a DIP. The ar-
rest was made around 8:30
p.m. on Saturday, April 1.

Not just a young
person’s pastime

Goshen resident Paul Reth-
ford was also arrested and
charged with a DIP on April‘
1. Rethford, age 75, was ar-
rested around 7:20 p.m.

Always get the proper
Hcense

Lexington resident Mar-

tin Nicholas was charged
with attempting to obtain
money by false pretense, a
felony charge. According
to Lexington Police Chief
Bruce Beard, the arrest was
made on Wednesday, April 5
around 8 p.m. Nicholas was
also charged with attempt-
ing to practice bail bonding
without a license. That
charge is a misdemeanor.
The offenses were commit-
ted in Rockbridge County,
not Lexington, but Lexing-

ton oiﬁcers served the war-
rants.

Drunk walkers
beware

26-year-old Jonathan
Strumb was arrested around
9 p.m. on Friday, April 7.
He was charged with public
drunkenness.

Unfriendly ﬁsticuffs
Linda Lasley and Katrina
Zirkle have charged each
other with simple assault.
Police Chief Bruce Beard
said the two had ﬁled what
is called cross warrants
against each other. Essen-
tially each woman claimed
that the other woman as-
saulted her. The incident
was reported around noon
on Saturday, April 8. Lasley
is a Lexington resident, and
Zirlke listed her address as
Harrisonburg, Virginia.

The one way sign
strikes again

Thomas Clarke, age 25, was
arrested on DUI charges on
Saturday, April 8. The ar-
rest occurred around 9 p.m.
Beard said Clarke was ar-
rested on Jackson Avenue.
He was stopped because he
was traveling the wrong way
on a one way street. He was

issued a ticket for that as
well as for failing to obey a
“Do Not Enter” sign.

Driving recklessly
won't help you hide

Richard Clark was arrested
and charged with driving un-
der the inﬂuence on April 8.
The time of arrest was listed
as 11:22 p.m., and Clark was
also charged with reckless
driving. Furthermore, he
was ticketed for failing to
have registration.

Back to back

Fairﬁeld, Virginia resident
Edgar Bryant was ar-
rested two days in a row
and charged with public
drunkenness. The ﬁrst DIP
arrest came on the morning
of Sunday, April 9, and the
second arrest came Mon-
day night. Beard reported
that both arrests came in a
parking lot garage. During
the Sunday arrest, Oﬂicers
Stewart and Coffey reported
that Bryant showed signs of
public intoxication, and on
Monday, Officer Fitzgerald
said Bryant showed indica-
tions of intoxication, in-
cluding slurred speech and
bloodshot eyes.

Protests continue at UVa despite student arrests

continued from page 1

school’s wage reﬂects the high
cost of living in the Washington,
D.C. area. Virginia Military In-
stitute and University of Virginia
at Wise, in contrast, have a mini-
mum hourly wage of only $6.83.

Wood said reports that the
students were going hungry were
overblown.

“President Casteen asked them
if they needed food and at least
one said they were ﬁne. They lat-
er voted to accept some food and
we delivered it to them.”

Once the sit-in began, UVa
police ofﬁcers limited access to
Madison Hall. “We limited the
people coming in,” Wood said,
“because with seventeen people
in the lobby it made daily opera-
tion difficult.”

Casteen eventually order the
students to be arrested because
of the disruptions the sit-in was
causing for university employees.

“I’d say if we combined po-
lice and staff maybe 60-80 people
were working,” Wood said, “but
that’s around the clock. Not all
of those people were there at one
time.”

Wende Marshall, an assistant
professor of Anthropology, was
arrested on Wednesday, April 12
when she tried to get inside Madi-
son Hall. Wood referred ques-
tions about Marshall’s arrest to
the university police, saying that
the arrest was “really a police
matter.”

University professors have
been largely supportive of the
student demonstrators, holding
teach-ins and speaking at the daily
rallies. On Wednesday, April 19,
223 UVa faculty members issued
a press release urging Casteen to
approve the proposed wage in-
creases.

“Luckily professors and facul-
ty have been tremendous and very
supportive. The students inside
[Madison Hall] haven’t faced any
academic punishments and sanc-
tions. Thankfully the movement
is big enough for other people to
cover for you when you need to
go get things done,” Rosenbaum
said.

Mo Nichols, a recycling techni-
cian at UVa, provided an insider’s
perspective on the issue. When
asked if she thought UVa would
meet the protesters’ demands, she

offered an interesting answer.

“I don’t like to think of them
as bending so much as I think
of them as standing up and say-
ing everyone who works at UVa
-— contract or regular workers
— deserves to make a fair wage.”

Nichols said that very few
of her colleagues are getting in-
volved with the issue.

“What I’ve noticed is that
very few [employees] are en-
gaged. There’s a real culture of
fear among employees. People
in poverty don’t know the power
they have.” she said.

Washington and Lee’s acting-
president, Harlan Beckley, is well
aware of living wage and poverty
issues.

Beckley helped found the

W&L’s Shepherd Poverty Pro-
gram. Beckley said the school
pays a minimum hourly wage of
$9.00.

“The difference [between UVa
and W&L] is that [UVa is] con-
tracting out some jobs. We don’t
have very much of that,” Beckley
said. “By design this is a com-
munity staff.”

“I don’t know how productive
communications are if they exist,”
Nichols said. “Things move very
slowly and people don’t have a
lot of faith in getting action.”

Beckley said he could not
imagine ever having to arrest stu-
dents camped out in Washington
Hall. “I wouldn’t say never, but I
can’t imagine it,” he said.

While UVa does offer some

* courses on poverty, acting-Presi-

dent Beckley said that the Shep-
herd Poverty Program has im-
proved understanding of poverty
issues at W&L.

“I’d like to think that because
of the poverty courses students

' and faculty have become more

conscious of the issue,” he said.
“Does that mean our compensa-
tion is adequate and we don’t
need to do anything more? No.”

Charles Shackelford, a ﬁrst
year student at UVa, said that stu-
dents are conscious of the issue
but not all are involved.

“We had our school elections
last month,” Shackelford said,
“and about 80 percent voted to
have the school use a living wage
of take the issue to the General

Assembly. People agree with the
proposal but don’t realize some-
body has to pay for it.”

“People like to avoid poor
people,” Mo Nichols said. “They
don’t realize how bad it is and
how many full—time employees at
UVa have two or three jobs and
are part of the working poor.

As all parties involved in the
debate look ahead, serious dis-
putes remain between the differ-
ent parties.

On Thursday, April 20, Cas-
teen issued a letter to the commu-
nity regarding competitive com-
pensation. Casteen met, without
success, with the sit-in protesters
on several occasions. A student
forum on poverty will occur on
Tuesday, April 15.

commented on why this issue has

THE RING-TUM PHI" 3

 

to the editor

: Parent questions double standard

I!

V

To the Editor:

I have attempted to “join the
conversation" on the strategic
plan and provide some feedback
in an effort to help point out what
I believe is a policy that is detri-
mental to the University.

I received no response. After
three weeks, a follow-up email
and telephone call, I was brushed
off and advised that since I dis-
agreed with University policy
that I need not join the conversa-
tion. The Provost’s response, or
lack of one, to my e-mails speaks
volumes.

To the Provost:

I emailed the Admissions De-
partment about this issue and I
was advised by Jonathan Webster,
Associate Dean of Admissions,

: that “W&L’s Board of Trustees

sets the institution’s admission
policies and has aﬂirmed the val-
ue of ethnic diversity on campus
and its consideration in our (the)
admission decision-making.”
Sarah Kientz’ article, Minor-
ity Report, in the Ring-tum Phi,
published on Parents’ Weekend,
reported that at Washington and
Lee “many believe that minority

students are favored in the admis-
sions process.” However, Admis-
sions Counselor Charlie Boisky
admitted that the Admissions De-
partment gives many incentives,
including ﬁnancial, to minority
students to expose them to the
campus and to get them to apply;
however, everyone is on equal
ground when it comes to applying
to W&L. He further added that
no students are accepted based on
ethnicity and that “minority stu-
dents are every bit as qualiﬁed as
everyone else.” Erin Hutchinson,
Assistant Director of Admissions
and Coordinator of Minority Re-
cruitment, said that minority sta-
tus often comes into play when
the department is “separating
equals.” I strongly suspected that
the quoted Adrnission’s Officers
were spinning their responses and
not being forthright in regards to
black and Hispanic applicants.
Also, during Parents’ Week-
end, Harlan Beckley gave the
President’s Report to Parents, in
the Lee Chapel, with a large fo-
cus on diversity. Afterwards, in a
question and answer session, he
responded to a parent’s question

To the Editor:

I was very unhappy to receive
an email promoting the “Celebrat-
ing Women at W&L” event. At
ﬁrst glance, I truly thought it was
a joke. With topics such as “Be

’ Comfortable in ‘your GENES”

and “Honor and Feminist Eth-
ics,” I was sure that W&L could
not have become just another
university, catering to those who
worship at the altar of political
correctness.

This event purports to cele-
brate coeducation at W&L, but by
its very existence further divides
the sexes. Celebrating half of the
student body is as offensive and
discriminatory as having a “Men’s
Day,” or “Celebrating White
People at W&L” day. Why not

celebrate the accomplishments
of men at W&L? Certainly, men
have done SOMETHING worthy
of celebration in the ﬁrst 90 per-
cent of W&L’s history? Why is
there a “women.wlu.edu” and no
“men.wlu.edu?” Isn’t that a huge
double standard? Why not cel-
ebrate the admission of African
Americans? Or homosexuals? Or
Jews? Haven’t these groups also
added to the W&L experience?
Without question, the admit-
tance to women was one of the
most signiﬁcant improvements
to Washington and Lee over the
course of its 250-plus year his-
tory. As a member of the Class
of 1989, I saw the transition ﬁrst
hand. The women who enrolled
were not trail-blazing feminists

THE RING-TUM PHI IS A

about that same article, Minority
Report, in a rather unsatisfactory
manner. The questioner asked if
minorities are given preference
in the application for admissions
process. In fairness, President
Beckley acknowledged that he
had not read the article, but he
went on without answering the
question to express repeatedly
how important he believed racial
diversity is to the University with-
out substantiating the beneﬁts or
expressing what costs there might
be to increasing racial diversity.
After this event concluded, I
overheard more than just a few
other parents in discreet and po-
lite conversations discussing this
issue.

Jonathan Webster and I had
a brief discussion at Glenelg
Country School about that article.
He acknowledged that numer-
ous types of incentives, includ-
ing ﬁnancial, are offered only
to minority students in an effort
to have them gain interest in the
University and apply. He went
even further by analogizing the
preferences the Admissions De-
partment offers minority students

in admission by expressing, “It's
no different from how we treat
athletes or legacies.” Those were
his words, not mine. So that there
was no misunderstanding he fur-
ther explained “that it is the only
way we can get them in.”

In the Strategic Plan, the Ad-
missions Task Force lists one of
their charges as follows: increase
American racial and ethnic diver-
sity on campus to a level approxi-
mating the mean among rural, na-
tional liberal arts colleges. What
discemable difference is there be-
tween this goal and a quota?

I emailed Dean Hartog request-
ing standardized test score data
for the entering freshman class
for the past ten years, broken out
by ethnicity. Unfortunately, Dean
Hartog very courteously declined
to honor my request. A different
member of the Administration,
who shall remain anonymous in-
formed me, in writing, that the in-
formation I requested is regularly
tabulated and readily available.
So what is any reasonable person
to conclude? If the Admissions
Department is unwilling to release
this information it is because they

celebrating

with an agenda to “right a wrong”
at W&L. They didn’t enroll to
end 200 years of oppression.
They enrolled to be a part of the
tradition, not to end it. They were
well-rounded, intelligent women
who were there for the conserva-
tive, honorable,‘ highly respected
education. The very reason they
came to W&L was to become a
part of the community, not to cre-
ate a separate group at the Univer-
sity. They didn’t get upset when
Professor F utch made them wear
ties to class. It didn’t bother them
when the campus watering hole
was called the “Cockpit.” They
were not there to be a separate
class but to be a part of the Uni-
versity.

Clearly, the addition of women

has greatly enhanced the univer-
sity in many ways. Some of my
best life-long friends are women
from the ﬁrst class. It is extremely
upsetting and disappointing to
see how PC W&L has become in
20 short years. The unfortunate
thing is that this shift in attitude
is permanent, as there are a great
number of alums being alienated
by these positions. I received an
email from a fraternity brother of
mine last week. It was short, but
prophetic. “Our W&L is dead,
never to retum.” I hope that is
not the case, but I fear that W&L
is becoming just another PC liber-
al arts university. Resist the urge

to follow the ﬂock.

It’s protest season

Ah, spring.

The time of year ﬁlled with
sunshine and ﬂowers brings with
it something worse than allergies:

Protest season.

It seems to be a nation-wide
phenomenon.

Suddenly, as students emerge
from the conﬁnes of their cinder-
block living structures and realize
that there is, in fact, a world out-
side of exams, they realize injus-
tice around them.

Locally, the protests at the Uni-
versity of Virginia sprang up after
students had been fairly stagnant
on the issue all winter.

But that is not the only place
students have taken up a cause.

In Florida, students from three
colleges held a sit-in in the state
capitol, demanding investigation
into the death of a 14-year-old
boy at a boot camp.

In Washington, several groups
are meeting, including some from
Washington and Lee.

There are Earth Day protests,
and vigils against oppression,
and marches against genocide all
month.

Could be that this is coinciden-
tally a very politically—charged
time in our lives.

Or, the weather is nice and it
beats going to class.

The Phi is certainly never
against using your Constitutional
rights to help institute change in
your government.

By all means, get out there and
shout--but only if you believe in
the cause.

The students at UVa seemed

surprised that they were actually
arrested for holding a sit-in.

They thought it was not fair
that they were denied food and
comfort.

For some reason, the glamor-
ized image of protesting has led
students to think it’s easy.

Throw a ﬁt, get what you want,
right?

Not in the real world.

The students at UVa should
have considered other routes be-
fore going off the deep end.

For example, could they, for a
moment, sit down and reasonably
consider the implications of their
demands?

How would the school pay
higher wages to its employees?

By raising the students’ tu-
ition, of course.

But because the students do not
actually pay tuition, it becomes an
imaginary number: largely con-
fusing and easy to ignore.

Without fully understanding
the implications of their actions,
students will like the idea of mak-
ing a difference and rush to make
posters and camp out in public
lobbies.

The school was probably
wrong, but more just stupid, to ar-
rest the 17 students camping out
in their administrative buildings.

Because now they have an
army of stir-crazy students just
waiting to jump on the bandwag-
on of anything touting goodwill.

And during protest season,
anything can happen.

This represents the majority
opinion of the editorial board.

have something to hide and are
not being forthright. If there is
nothing to hide, you put it on the
Institutional Research site.

So what do I make of this?
The Consortium on Financing
Higher Education (COFHE) com-
piled and shared SAT scores, and
other statistics, on entering class-
es at 26 of the nation’s top col-
leges and universities with those
member schools. The difference
between black and white scores
was less than 100 points at only
one school, Harvard. It exceeded
200 points at nine schools. So,
to think that at W&L, which has
increased black enrollment more
than 100 percent in the last de-
cade, is only using race as a way
of “separating equals” is so sta-
tistically improbable, bordering
on impossible, that it can’t help
but stir up suspicion and resent-
ment. Do I have a problem with
minorities attending W&L? No.
Unequivocally, if a student of any
race is the best academically qual-
iﬁed and merits a position I salute
him. But, I do have a problem
with helping one group of people
by hurting another group. What I

do believe with every ﬁber of my
body is that skin color should not
be a factor, one way or the other.
I appreciated Jonathan Webster’s
candor. And I respect his sincer-
ity, though I do not agree, that an
admission’s policy of preferences
for minorities is necessary to en-
rich the educational experience of
all.

I received the Feb. 27 copy
of the Ring-tum Phi, which con-
tained the article Urban Devel-
opment. It describes the Posse
Foundation Program. How is it
that the youthful, inexperienced
founder of the Posse, Deborah
Bial, has miraculously developed
an alternative way to judge a stu-
dents capabilities? I ask that you
revisit these policies. The Posse
program should be summarily re-
jected. Please know that I have
a sophomore in high school that
will be making her college deci-
sion in the not too distant future.
I would love for her to attend
W&L; however, your consider-
ation of this matter will rightfully
be a consideration for her.

Chi Omega freshman form an intimidating offensive line during the sorority football tournament on Thursday

Down and Derby

Derby Days is for a good cause, but the competition can be brutal

By Bree Melton
smrr woman

Hosted by Sigma Chi chapters
across the nation, Derby Days is a
week of events coordinated with
the intention of reaching out to
the community.

lt seems of late, though, that
the original aims of promoting
brotherhood, the spirit of commu-
nity service and a positive Greek
image have fallen by the wayside
for exclusive parties and inter-so-
rority rivalry.

The ﬁrst week of spring term
ﬁnds the five sororities on campus
pitted against each other despite a
yearlong campaign encouraging
Panhellenic unity as they vie for
the affections and approval of the
brothers of Sigma Chi.

All in the name of good fun
and fundraising for Campus
Kitchens, sorority women began
the week by participating in ﬁeld
day activities ranging from dizzy

bat to egg toss to tug of war.

The week continued with a
cook-off, powder puff football
and skits. In addition, the soror-
ity women competed in a banner
competition and penny race.

Each event was scored, and
the sorority with the most points
won Derby Days.

This year Kappa came out on
top with Theta in a close second.

Though most people ﬁnd it
hard to believe that there is, in
fact, a philanthropic motive be-
hind the events of Derby Days.
There was an entrance fee for the
cook—off.

Each sorority donated $150 -

and all of the proceeds went to
Campus Kitchens, “a ground-
breaking initiative that brings
colleges and universities together
with student volunteers, on-cam-
pus dining services professionals,
and community organizations to
combat hunger in cities across the
United States.”

3.;

With such a visible and nation-
ally recognized event, the frater-
nity has the opportunity to use
Derby Days as a way to promote
a positive image of Greek life and
really give back to the commu-
nity.

But somehow the true mean-
ing of Derby Days is lost among
the drive to put on great parties,
chug beer and make fools of the
sorority women, especially the
new initiates.

Says one junior, “[Derby Days]
is a fun relaxing way to start off
spring tenn and a good way to
spend time with your sisters.”

Not all would agree with
this statement. For most soror-
ity women, it can be stressful
coordinating an impressive skit,
organizing a football team with
little or no help from the assigned
Sigma Chi coaches and painting
a banner all in the ﬁrst week of a
new academic term.

One of the biggest problems
the sororities face, especially
with the administration moving to
make spring term more academi-
cally rigorous, is encouraging at-
tendance not only to participate
in the different events, but also
to provide support and spirit for
their sisters.

Dean Watkins commented that
she did not know much about Der-
by Days because, even though she
was aware of it during her own
college years, it was not nearly as

‘consuming on her campus as it

is here at Washington and Lee.
She believes that this is a
function of the predominance
of the Greek system among the
student population.
Unfortunately, this means
that there is a signiﬁcant group

of students noticeably left out '

of the festivities.

While Derby Days is tradi-
tionally a good time remem-
bered for aftemoon bands,
hilarious misadventures and
sorority tomfoolery, the true
goal of Derby Days seems only
secondary.

As it departs more and more
from the charitable objective,
the events of Derby Days fall
dangerously close to exploiting
the sorority women who par-
ticipate in the competition.

Spring term should be a
time for enjoying friends and
exploring new opportunities.

And Derby Days should
serve as an example to the rest
of the campus by setting phil-
anthropic goals and creating
awareness for important issues
all the while encouraging rela-
tionships between Greek orga-
nizations.

If Sigma Chi focuses on
ncouraging friendly competi-
tion, Derby Days can still fos-
ter the sense of fun and relax-
ation with which spring term at
W&L has become associated.

Remembering
the Holocaust

Hillel sponsors numerous events to
commemorate the victims and keep
us from forgetting the Holocaust

By Abrl Nelson
STAFF WRITER

In the midst of the excitement
of spring falls Yom HaShoah,
the official Jewish holiday com-
memorating the Holocaust, which
is marked by events to celebrate
diversity, and serves to remind us
of the intolerance and abuse that
resulted from undeserved hatred.

The officers of Hillel, Wash-
ington and Lee’s student-run J ew-
ish community, decided to bring
Holocaust Remembrance Week to
campus last year at the suggestion
of sophomore Arie George. Hillel
groups across the nation organize
events such as lectures and vari-
ous kinds of gatherings on Yom
HaShoah, which is April 25 this
year.
The Hebrew word “shoah”
means destruction, and the holi-
day is meant as a time to remem-
ber the six million Jews and ﬁve
million other victims who died in
the Holocaust, but also as a time
to raise awareness about hate and
prejudice.

“I look at Holocaust Remem-
brance Week as a tool to educate
people about the greater problems
that are associated with hatred
and bigotry,” said junior Justine
Dargahi, the executive president
of Hillel.

Planned activities include the
showing of two movies in the
John  Elrod Commons Theater,
a candlelight vigil in front of Lee
Chapel, a special Yom HaShoah
service, a scroll signing event
in the Commons Atrium and a

speech featuring George Salton, a
Holocaust survivor.

“It is our hope that such a
tragedy never happens again any-
where, to any people,” said Hil-
lel faculty sponsor Joan Robins.
Robins added that the activities of
the week are meant to be for all
students and that anyone is wel-
come at any event.

Salton, the author of the well-
known Holocaust memoir The
23rd Psalm, is a friend of Darga-
hi’s family and is ﬂying to Lext
ington from Florida for the talk,
which will be followed by a book
signing.

“There is no better way to learn
about the Holocaust than to hear
the ﬁrst hand story of survival,”
said Dargahi. “People become
more passionate about something
if they know or have met some-
one personally affected by it.”

The candlelight vigil in front
of Lee Chapel is the newest ad-
dition to the program and will be
led by Burr Datz, W&L’s Coordi-
nator of Religious Life.

According to Dargahi, it is
meant to be a way for students to
speak out against oppression in
any form, be it racial, sexual, reli-
gious or anything else. The event
is co-sponsored by the W&L Mul-
tifaith Council.

“I feel that everyone on cam-
pus should be affected in some
way by the week,” said Dargahi.
“The more we work to educate
people and learn about past atroc-
ities that have been spawned from
hatred, the less likely things like
the Holocaust will happen.”

THE RING-TUM PHI ° 5

Debauchery in denial

Is Derby Days a shameless exhibition or the best part of Spring Term?

SHE SAID

Another spring term, another
set of Derby Days which brings
us another round of penny col-
lecting, t- shirt buying, and pow-
der-puif football.

We ﬁnd ourselves donning
our newly purchased spring term
clothing and heading out to Pole
3 or the Dojo and even out to Ja-
cob’s Ladder.

There we ﬁnd ourselves
crowded into these houses and
forced to bump back and forth
between people on our way to the
bathroom. Ahhhh... I love spring
term.

Why do we do it? Why do
freshmen girls ﬁght to the death
to win this competition?

Is it just to hook up with the
fabulous men of the Sigma Chi
house? Understandable.

Are you tapping into your
charitable side for that wonder-
ful new organization on campus
known as Campus Kitchen Pro-
gram? You’re a better person
than me.

Or do you just want to win?
Yeah you do.

The glory and you’re srat
pledge class picture in the paper is
enough to make any girl yell “(in-
sert sorority here) what?” Some
of these girls seem willing to do
anything to win.

Desperately they collect coins
from the comers of couches at
random party houses and frat
basements.

Even their domestic side
comes out as they call up mom
and ask her how to marinade the
steaks they plan on serving on the
frat lawn.

All of this competition in the
name of tradition. Welcome to
Dubyahnell.

I personally am a fan of Derby
Days. Why is it that when girls
play football behind the pole
houses it’s a “shameless exhibi-
tion of women” but when they do
it for something else- like a school
ﬁinction, people consider it ok?

Let the girls play. They’re
having fun. CKP is making mon-
ey. Sigma Chi is hosting another
successful Derby Days.

It’s spring term- most profes-

sors are lucky if students show up .

to their aﬁemoon classes sober let
alone at all.

It is meant to be enjoyed by
all, and Derby Days is the best
way to introduce freshmen to
these wonderful six weeks.

I don’t know why the adminis-
tration thinks we’ll want
to spend our spring

  
  
   

HE SAID

Last year I was forced to miss
Derby Days due to athletic ob-
ligations, and after witnessing
all of the festivities last week, I
must say that I was extremely im-
pressed.

Of course, it wasn’t the sorori-
ties or their activities that leﬁ me
in awe.

It was the power of Sigma Chi
to convince girls to partake in the
debauchery that was truly impres-
sive.

Perhaps Derby Days
is merely Sigma

else. proving their

Then we’re to get girls
just taking dmnk and

with us. v

I know that those
abroad wish that they could have
taken Derby Days with them to
their assorted locations, But alas,
they cannot- making them jealous
of all of us here.

Not to worry--those abroad
just need to thank the creators
of hil1humor.com for only taking
one class so they can keep the site
updated.

V Derby Days is just one part of
spring term, but it remains one of
the best parts.

So thank the men of Sigma
Chi for letting us partake in their
tradition. Tradition is after all
what makes Washington and Lee,
Washington and Lee.

Maybe we’re not speaking as
much on the hill anymore, but
we are chatting it up out at these
functions such as Derby Days.

So just go and enjoy yourself
this spring term. I know I will.

This weeks Hot Topic was written by

columnists Tim Livingston and Madeline Gent.

 
 

whereas the Sigma
Chi’s employ the likes
of Clayton Edwards to persuade
girls to get inebriated and amuse
the frat lords.

Derby Days is a contest remi-
niscent of something that would
take place in a land where males
contain power over their female
counterparts.

Last time I checked, this meta-
phorical realm that Sigma Chi has
created doesn’t reﬂect our con-
temporary society.

This begs the query, what
makes girls participate in these
events for this obviously domi-
nant fraternity?

Although my friend Mad-
eline Gent suggested that Derby
Days represents a means for the
forlorn princesses of W&L to be
swooped up by the classy, fratty,
and sophisticated men of Sigma
Chi, I feel there must be another
answer.

First of all, those who argue
that girls partake in these silly
fraternity games because the pro-
ceeds go to a good cause are deﬁ-
nitely mistaken.

I believe I’ve discovered the
true reason why sorority women,
who are used to being venerated
and pampered by fratemity men,
agree to take part in Derby Days.

The reason does not reside in
the awesome men of Sigma Chi
(even though guys like Richard
Simms might disprove this theo-
ry); on the other hand, the spring
term festivities are a result of the
female desire to always be the
center of attention.

In reality, how would Derby
Days be affected if there was no
sorority involvement and the con-
tests were ousted?

Nothing would change be-
cause for all those who aren’t
Sigma Chi’s, Derby Days is not
about the competitions.

The week’s fun only relies on
the fratastic parties.

In fact, I believe all who at-
tended the DOJO on Thursday
would agree that the only damper
on the night was when the crowd
was hushed to allow the sororities
to present their skits.

Whoever seriously believed
that a majority of the party desired
to halt mingling and macking (if
that’s a real word) on hotties to
watch a couple of sorority girls
make fools of themselves was
greatly removed from the general
consensus.

Many contend that Derby
Days is demeaning to women, and
feel that is the primary reason for
modifying the week’s activities.

I maintain that sorority in-
volvement in Sigma Chi’s week
of parties is superﬂuous and an-
noying.

Maybe I’m envious that girls
dislocate shoulders and puke on
themselves for a cooler fraternity,
but I feel I speak for the whole
non-Sigma Chi male community
when I say this:

None of us care that Kappa
Kappa Gamma won the grueling
competition.

Until sororities sponsor a tour-
nament in which I have an excuse
to drink all day and play football,
I refuse to support Derby Days
unless sororities are totally taken
out of the picture.

How to land your dream job

The end of the school year is rapidly approach-

ing as seniors are for employment and under-

classmen are looking for internships and sum-

mer jobs. A&L Editor Kathryn Krall gives you

what you need to ace the interview.

WHAT TO SAY

Practice commonly asked
questions. Ask a friend to play
the part of the interviewer and go
through the possible questions.

Some examples:

° What have you achieved that

makes you proud?

° Why should we hire you

rather than the other candi-

dates?

- What is a weakness that

could hinder your perfor-

mance?

Be honest. W&L students are
terrible liars, probably because
we have been out of practice for
so long, so don’t even try.

In addition to honesty about
accomplishments, be sincere
about weaknesses as well. When
the interviewer asks about your
faults, do not give him or her the
classic “I am just too perfect,”
but rather elaborate on a weak-
ness that you will be able to de-

velop into a strength.

Research the company before-
hand. This sharpens you ability
to give answers that will enable
that interviewer to imagine you
working for the business. The
more you understand both the
activities and the overall business
philosophy of the organization,
the better prepared you will seem
to ﬁt in.

Make the interview a two-way
conversation. This is as much
about you getting to know the
company as it is about them get-
ting to know you. Look around.
Can you see yourself working for
this company? If the interviewer
asks if you have any questions,
use this time to determine wheth-
er you would ﬁt in.

Use lots of examples. Instead
of speaking in abstract terms, use
concrete examples to describe
your talents. Instead of “I work

well with others” say, “I worked
as a member of a group to suc-
cessfully complete a project.”
Tout yourself, but instead of us-
ing adjectives, use stories.

WHAT TO WEAR

Be conservative. Now is not
the time to make a fashion state-
ment. Go easy on thejewelry,
and tone down the nail polish
and make-up.

Dress accordingly. Try to ﬁt
your attire to the style of com-
pany, but dress a notch or two
more formally.

Be modest. Made sure the
hemlines are not too high or the
necklines too low. Remember,
you are selling your brains.
Girls, wear stockings.

Follow conventional rules.
You know, no white after Labor
Day and all the other delightful
rules your mother taught you.

No ﬂip-ﬂops.

HOW TO ACT

Smile. Even the most quali-
ﬁed applicant can be turned
away for lack of common cour-
tesy.

Make sure your handshake

is conﬁdent. Also, a non-
sweaty handshake is preferred.
If you are nervous, wipe your
hands on a tissue just before
you begin your interview.

Make eye contact. This
shows your conﬁdence and is
a sign of respect to the inter-
viewer. Lack of eye contact is
an immediate tum off.

Don’t be afraid to pause. A
moment of silence may seem
awkward, but the interviewer
knows you need to plan what
to say. A pause is always bet-
ter than jumping right in or an

Tum off your cell phone.
And if you accidentally leave it
on, never ever answer it.

REMEMBER

Relax. You will be more
impressive if you take a few
deep breaths and remind your-
self that there are many other
opportunities out there if this
one does not work out.

The worst case scenario is
that you don’t get the job. If
they don ’t want you, it prob-
ably wasn’t the right place for
you anyway.

 

While Foxﬁelds may be advertised as a
horse race, we all know that it is actually
an opportunity to ﬂaunt your spring ﬁn-
est. So bring out your bright colors and

get ready to dazzle the crowds.

James paves the way

Sophomore is skills have the Generals rankea’ seventeenth in the nation

By Kathryn Krall
ARTS 8: LIFE EDITOR

With straight soaring drives,
consistently low scores and un-

' shakable poise, Nathaniel James

is an essential contributor to the
success of the golf team and is
establishing a reputation for
himself on the national level.
He has the lowest scoring
average on the team and has tal-

talent extends
(Amherst: Va-l beyond stats.
April 24 and 25 He provides

an example
of hard work and a burning de-
sire to win that motivates the
entire team to play their best.

James was taught to play
golf by his father, who began
instructing him at a very young
age.

“I don’t remember when I
started because I was so young,”
said James.

He competed in his ﬁrst tour-
nament at age six. James played
at first because it was a family

event, but he found the competi-
tion enjoyable.

“When I was young, I won
a lot. That kept me interested,”
said James.

James’ older brother is also
a golfer. As a young golfer, he
looked up to his big brother,
both wanting to be like him and
wanting to beat him.

“Part of the reason I wanted
to get better was to be able to
win against him," said James.

There was always a good—na-
tured competition between the
brothers.

“In some sense there is a ri-
valry between us,” said James,
“but we always cheer for each
other.”

As a freshman, James’ con-

tribution to the team was im-
mediate. In his ﬁrst year of
college golf he place second at
the ODAC championship. He
was named ODAC Rookie of
the Year, and First Team All-
ODAC. James won W&L Male
Freshman Athlete of the Year.
His outstanding performance
continued this year. For the
week of March 29, James was
named ODAC Co-Golfer of the
Week. He has paced the team in
wins, and earlier in the season
he had the lowest putting aver-
age of any player in the nation.
James’ strength is his short
game, which includes shots in
and around the green. His fa-
vorite aspect has also been a
struggle in the last few weeks.

“Right now, putting is my
weakness,” he said, “I’m in a
putting funk.”

The highlight of the season
both for James and for the en-
tire team came at the Virginia
State Championship, which was
won by the Washington and Lee
team. James was tied for ﬁrst,
and in a dramatic ﬁnish defeated
his competitor to win the tour-
nament.

A low point for James was
the Jekyll Island tournament.
James held the lead for two
rounds, but choked in the third
round to ﬁnish in a disappoint-
ing eleventh place.

James sees golf in his fu-
ture. “If I continue to improve,
I would like to play golf profes-

sionally, at least for a while,” he

said.

Due to his outstanding per-
formance this year, James may
possibly compete at Nation-
als. The announcement will be
made on May 1. -

The team is currently ranked
seventheenth in the nation, and
will compete at ODAC Champi-
onships on April 23-24, in Pop-
lar Grove, Virginia.

Optimistic about loss

After disappointing showing, lacrosse says it can improve

By Madeline Gent
STAFF WRITER

The men’s lacrosse team re-
mained busy over break and the
beginning of spring term improv-
ing their record to 5-5 and 2-3 in
ODAC play.

With games against Roanoke,
Guilford and Virginia Wesleyan
during Spring Break, the Gener-
als found themselves progressing
while preparing to qualify for the

- ODAC tournament.

The generals lost to Roanoke
16-7 on April 9 but defeated Guil-
ford 13-3 on April 12. Freshman
midﬁelder Harry St. John led the
Generals to a 11-5 victory over
Virginia Wesleyan on April 15.
St. John scored_a career-high four
goals.

set as a freshman... He draws the
best defensive midﬁelders from
the other team. It’s a real testa-
ment to the kind of season he is
having,” coach Mike Cerino said
of the April 16 ODAC player of
the week.

Sophomore Ned Rider, who
netted four goals in the three
games, said of the play over
break, “It was a tough loss against
Roanoke. It was all mental, and
I think we’ll get them if we play
again. We beat Guilford, but we

“He’s really been a great as-

had a really good game against
Virginia Wesleyan... we are
building on our games and'start-
ing to click as a team.”

On Saturday the Generals
faced the Hampden-Sydney Ti-
gers. Hampden-Sydney jumped
to a 4-1 lead over the Generals.
The Tigers held that lead to the
end of the fourth quarter when the
Generals came within two goals.

Freshman Tim Skeen led the
Generals with four goals, two of
which came off assists from ju-
nior midﬁelder Charlie Clarke.

Yet that wasn’t enough against
the Tigers, who were led by
Thomas Jennings and Eamon
Thorton.

The pair scored three goals
each. -

“We didn’t shoot very well,
and we didn’t handle pressure
well. We didn’t take enough shots
and had a lot of unforced errors
which is not like us,” said junior
attacker Grant Martin.

The Generals took 33 shots
which is the least amount taken
since the 29 they took against
Franklin and Marshall on March
19.

An overworked defense may
be one reason for the General’s
loss.

The Tigers’ goalie made 13
saves compared to Generals goal-

ie Chris Lalli, who had four.

“We didn’t play well in the ﬁrst
half at all so our defense played
the whole half which really wore
them out," said Rider

Rider ﬁnished the contest with
a goal and an assist.

“I don’t think we came ready
to play, and I don’t know why.

We didn’t play anywhere near our
best lax,” said senior midﬁelder
and captain Perrin Monroe.

The Generals will continue
their season Tuesday in the Lee-
Jackson Lacrosse Classic. They
will play Virginia Military Insti-
tute under the lights at 7:30 p.m.
on the turf ﬁeld.

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 7

Team looks forward to tourney

Continued from Page 8

hit it in his last home game at
W&L.

Also in that game, the Gener-
als committed six errors.

Two were charged to left-
ﬁelder Madden, three to second
baseman David Miller, and one
to senior Gosselink.

“That happens,” Stickley
said. ~

“You just hope it doesn’t
snowball.”

He pointed out that he was
glad the team was able to “stop
the bleeding,” and still play a
close game.

Meanwhile, catcher Wesley
suffered an injury in the bottom
of the ﬁfth inning and was taken
out of the game.

Stickley said Wesley had
pulled a muscle in his back or
chest, and though they were not
sure of the culprit, they did not
want to take any chances.

After the game, however,
Wesley said he was feeling bet-
ter.

Wesley, who has caught all
but a few innings this year, will
likely remain behind the plate for
the rest of the season.

“Calling a majority of the
games is tough,” Stickley said,
“but he’s done a great job.”

Assistant coach Eric Brookes
pointed out that Wesley has done
a lot of hard work, especially in
the recent high temperatures.

He talked about a game two
weeks ago when Wesley caught
19 innings in 85-degree tempera-
tures.

“That is asking a lot out of a
young kid,” he said, but added
that he thinks the catcher can
handle the rest of the season.

Even when doing a job his
head coach calls “physically and
mentally tough,” Wesley has
conﬁdence in himself.

“Even if I break a ﬁnger, I’ll
still tough it out,” he said.

Brookes explained that Wes-
ley has played so much this sea-
son based on his experience in
the past two years as a hitter and
backup catcher. ‘

He added that Dan Harris and
Chris Bolger, the two backup
catchers, have improved a great
deal throughout this season.

“We feel a lot better about the
backup situation,” he said.

Harris came into the game
when Wesley was taken out.
Stickley said he performed well,
hitting a single in the sixth in-
ning, and catching a foul bunt off
the bat of Daniel Mullins in the

eighth.

“He did a nice job,” Stickley
said.

Harris also ﬁlled in when
Stickley gave Wesley time to rest
during Tuesday’s non—conference
loss against West Virginia Tech.

Another player in need of rest
is ﬁrst baseman McConnell, who
has battled a back injury all sea-
son.

He was given a break when
coaches sent in freshman Andrew
Henderson at the end of Tuesday’s
game.

Stickley said that the coaches
were “really on edge” about Mc-
Connell’s back.

“We want to try to cut down on
the chances that he could hurt it,”
he said.

But the coaches do not want
to take McConnell out in the last
few games of his college career.

Brookes said, “We just try to
take it easy with him.”

Without two of their key start-
ers, the team did not perform well
on Tuesday, losing 11-0.

The coaches pointed out that
the loss was not because of the
backup players.

Brookes called it “one of
the few times this year when
we weren’t ready to play and it
showed.”

Stickley agreed.

“I was not pleased with that
effort,” he said, “and the guys
weren’t either.”

Stickley said that the men
lacked “mental preparedness” for
the game, in part because it was
played during the week.

He added, though, that he ex-
pects the team to bounce back.

“I’m sure we’ll respond well,”
he said.

Brookes agreed that the team
is ready to move on from Tues-
day’s loss.

“That’s behind us and hope-
fully the guys learned from it,”
he said.

Looking forward to the con-
ference tournament Thursday, the
team seems pretty conﬁdent.

The men play Bridgewater in
the opening round of the tourna-
ment.

They lost two heartbreaking
games to Bridgewater earlier this
year, each by only one run.

In the March 28 game, the
men were making a comeback in
the seventh inning when the game
was called because of darkness.

Despite the history, the Gen-
erals do not seem intimidated by
their opponents.

Gosselink said he is unafraid
of playing the top-ranked team in

doing the shuffle:

When Edwards pitches, the Generals make quite a few changes. To ﬁll his
place at third, Ray Sweeney moves over. He is replaced by Gosselink, who has
played short for W&L In the past. Miller comes in from left to play second.
Madden moves from rightfield to left, and is replaced by freshman Terrence
McKeIvey, who has made regular rounds in the batting order this season. ‘‘All of
them can play their positions,” Stickley said. “lt’s not really that big a deal.”

the conference.

“We can beat any team in this
tournament,” he said.

Teammate Wesley agreed.

“Overall, I’m not worried
about the tournament. Every year,
we come to play,” he said.

Though the games were close
today, he said Randolph-Macon
would not be a concern.

“They are not going to do any
damage in the tournament,” he
said.

He pointed out that last ‘year,
W&L was in a similar situation to
Randolph-Macon’s.

“No one expected us to do that
well, but we got hot in the middle
of the season,” he said.

The Generals beat three teams
in the ODACs last year, making it
all the way to the third day of the
tournament.

Wesley said that the team this
year is even better than last.

“We’re deeper this year,” he
said. “It’s just a matter of who is
going to step up.”

Hedrick said that his team fac-
es the same challenge.

“Our biggest handicap has
been our pitching,” he said.

Despite having one of the best
pitchers in the state, Randolph-
Macon’s other pitchers have not
been as consistent, he said.

He added that pitching would
make the dilference in how far

Randolph-Macon goes in the
tournament.

Gosselink said that because
this is not his ﬁrst time at the
tournament, he is not expecting to
play two games and go home.

But it is exactly that lack of
experience which has fueled
Randolph-Macon to the momen-
tum they have reached going into
Thursday’s tournament.

“It’s kind of a big deal for us,”
Hedrick said.

“I don’t think anyone expected
us to do as well as we have.”

Thursday should be an excit-
ing day for the Generals as well.

“We’re going to win the damn
thing,” Gosselink said.

Women 3 sports

' dominate, while
men is athletics
are slipping

By Tim Llvlngston
SPORTS EDITOR

The 2005-2006 season has
been an extremely successful
one for Washington and Lee.
With the success of this year’s
sports teams, many onlookers
question where the ’05—’06
season ranks among the best
in W&L history.

If this season is truly
the most prestigious in our
school’s history, it can be at-
tributed to the women.

The football team was one
heartbreaking loss away from
the ODAC championship,
men’s swimming ended the
season ranked fourteenth in
the country, and baseball, la-
crosse, men’s tennis and soc-
cer remain strong programs.

Who cares?

When W&L allowed wom-
en to attend our ﬁne institu-
tion, who would have thought
that they would pave the way
in athletics?

Who would have believed
that they would embarass
almost all men’s sports in
2006?

Perhaps this statistic will
help all the non—believers to
comprehend how thoroughly
women have dominated the
ODAC this season.

Does anyone have any idea
how many games the wom-
en’s volleyball, tennis, soccer,
swimming, lacrosse and ﬁeld
hockey teams have lost in the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference this season?

The answer is one. One
game. The culprit for the only
loss was the girl’s ﬁeld hock-
ey team, who dropped a game
to Virginia Wesleyan, but later
won the ODAC and advanced
all the way to the NCAA tour-
ney.

What is the reason for the
success of our women? Who
knows.

Of course, Hampden—Syd—
ney must be feeling pretty
foolish for their decision to
shun the temptation of going
co—ed.

The truth remains that be-
cause they started less than
20 years-ago, none of our
women’s sports have a rich
tradition.

Nonetheless, our women’s
tennis team is the top team
in Division III, and our ﬁeld
hockey team, volleyball team
and lacrosse team are all na-
tionally ranked.

Moreover, these programs
continue to recruit and obtain
talent from around the coun-
try to bolster theit rosters. In
other words, women’s sports
at W&L show no signs of de-
cline in the near future.

Ironically, the ﬁelds that
were once conﬁned to only
the male persuasion are now
owned by the opposite sex.

As the girls continue to
thrive in the athletic realm,
one can only speculate how
the men will compete in the
future.

The truth remains that as
the women flourish, the men
are slipping. Guys, its time to
regroup. Robert E. Lee must
be spinning in his grave.

 

  

s ortsbriefs

Riding

Washington and Lee
claimed its ﬁrst ever ODAC
championship in riding on
Friday. The Generals posted
19 team points to defeat
defending champion Bridge-
water. Senior Caitlin Lane
was named ODAC Rider of
the Year and will compete

at the Intercollegiate Horse
Show (IHSA) National
Championships from May
4-7. Senior Katie Goodrich
was also named the ODAC
Scholar-Athlete for the 2006
season.

Baseball

W&L split with rival Ran-
dolph Macon (8-7, 6-7) to
ﬁnish the ODAC with a 10-8
record for the third year in

a row. The Generals were
losing 7-6 going into the

last inning, yet senior Taylor
McConnell and sophomore
James Madden homered in
the ﬁnal frame to give the
Generals the 8-7 win. Work-
ing in relief, sophomore Jeﬁ°
Pharis earned his ﬁrst career
win after pitching effectively
for the Generals throughout
the season.

Women's Lacrosse

A goal by Christine Bender
with less than 5 minutes
remaining in regulation led
the women’s lax team to

a 9-8 victory over confer-
ence foe Virginia Wesleyan
on Saturday. The win was
important for the Generals
who claimed the number
one seed in the ODAC tour-
nament with the victory.
Sophomore Megan Slosson
also was a key contributor
and scored two consecutive
goals to bring the Generals
back from a 7-5 deﬁcit.

Men’s Lacrosse

The Generals fell 11-8 to
Hampden-Sydney on Satur-
day, dropping them to 2-3 in
the ODAC and threatening
their playoff hopes. Fresh-
man Tim Skeen led the
Generals with 4 goals while

The Generals split with Randolph-Macon in close games to end regular season

W&L lost many
close decisions in the
ODAC this season,
biutihope to reverse
their fortunes in the
tournament

By Katherine Greene
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

When the baseball double-
header against Randolph-Macon
was rescheduled from Saturday
to Sunday due to rain, both teams
started to worry about their chanc-
es in the ODAC tournament.

The games, which determined
the Generals’ sixth-place standing
in the tournament, were not other-
wise important.

But come Thursday, it is going
to affect both teams’ pitching.

Both teams planned to start
their best pitchers Saturday.

Now, they are concerned that
the men will not have enough rest
before the tournament begins on
Thursday.

Randolph-Macon coach Ray
Hedrick said he is worried about
Travis Beazley, his star pitcher.

“It’s deﬁnitely going to affect

our pitching,” he said, but pointed ’ "

out that there was no alternative.

Catcher Jordan Wesley said
that the teams have the same is-
sue.
“Pitching is the biggest key to
surviving in the tournament,” he
said.

The Generals have had a fairly
good showing this year despite
a recent slump. The success, in
part, has been attributed to pitcher
Clayton Edwards.

At the end of the regular sea-
son, Edwards carried a team-high

6/wins with a 4.06 ERA.

But Beazley, in comparison,
had 8 wins and only a 1.77 ERA.

According to Generals head
coach Jelf Stickley, Randolph-
Macon has “probably the best
pitcher in the league.”

Despite this claim, Beazley
allowed the tying and winning
home rims in the ﬁnal inning of
the ﬁrst game.

The two runs were hit by se-
nior Taylor McConnell and soph-
omore slugger James Madden. It
was Madden’s seventh home run

this year.

Beazley started against Wash-
ington and Lee a year ago, but suf-
fered an embarrassing loss 22-l.

Shortstop Scott Gosselink
pointed out that last year’s loss
may have been an issue for the
Randolph-Macon pitcher.

“We hit him incredibly hard
last year,” Gosselink said, and
added that Beazley may have
been working out of a “need for
vengeance.”

Stickley said that Beazley had
vastly improved from that game.

“He’s a different player this
year,” Stickley said.

Hedrick agreed, saying he felt
lucky in his second year of coach-
ing at Randolph-Macon to have
such a solid player.

“I couldn’t ask for more,” he
said.

Hedrick compared Beazley to
W&L’s Edwards, saying that they
are both dynamic and talented
players.

Both pitchers also play third
base while not on the mound in
order to stay in the batting order.

The biggest hitting in the
games came from unlikely sourc-
es.

In the fourth inning, senior
David Mackenzie was hit on the
shoulder by a pitch, but the um-
pire said he had stepped over the
plate into it.

In retaliation, Mackenzie hom-
ered on the next pitch. It was his
ﬁrst home run all season.

He said he feels “nostalgic”
about the home run, because he

Womens ’team captures fourth consecutive win, awaits invitation to Nationals

Eight girls.

Nine perfect matches.

An undefeated season.

These ingredients fused as the
women’s tennis team swept its
competition at Guilford College
last weekend emerging victorious
in its fourth consecutive ODAC
tournament.

The Generals racked up a
hefty total of 99 points, followed
by Emory and Henry with 72 and
Hollins with 70.

Juniors Emily Applegate and
Katie Kingsbury represented the
team earning ODAC Player of the
Year and ODAC Scholar-Athlete
of the Year, respectively.

Applegate currently holds the
number one spot on the team, and
has maintained a ﬂawless record
this year. Though Kingsbury did

seasgn “WC d0 have

a really strong
team this year,” Kingsbury said.
“We have the talent. We have the
drive. Especially this year, there
are so many girls who believe
they can win.”

Not only did the Generals win
the ODAC tournament, but they
shut out every opponent, securing
victory in every set. .

“Winning all nine ﬂights was

a good way to start our post-
season,” junior Ginny Wortham
said.

Sweeping the six singles’
ﬂights were Applegate, freshman
Katie Tabb, Wortham, sopho-
more Leah Weston, freshman Tori
Christmas and sophomore Kelly
Will respectively.

Tabb and Wortham captured
ﬁrst in the number one doubles’
ﬂight, followed by an identical
ﬁrst place performance by Weston
and senior, captain Lisa Mabry.
Applegate and sophomore Rebec-
ca Timmis dominated their com-
petition to place ﬁrst as well in the
number three doubles ﬂight.

“We didn’t drop a set,” Mabry ,

said. “We’ve had a lot of the
younger girls do a really good
job. I think that we‘re as close as
ever, and that’s what makes us so
strong.”

Currently ranked ﬁrst in the na-
tion by the Intercollegiate Tennis
Association, the Generals await
an oﬂicial invitation to Nationals.

- If they win the ﬁrst two rounds,

defeating teams within their re-
gion, the girls will proceed to
California for the ﬁnal matches.

According to the ITA Division
III National Rankings, Trinity
University, Sewanee, Claremont-
Mudd-Scripps College and Emo-
ry University occupy the second
through ﬁfth spots.

According to head coach Cin-
da Rankin, the team has been fo-
cusing on the match at hand.

“I think that helps us keep ev-
erything in the present,” she said.
“Once we ﬁnish with this, we look

on to the next one. [The girls] are
deﬁnitely buying into that. They
are willing take that type of ap-
proach.”

Last year, W&L contended for
the number one spot at Nationals
with rival Emory. In the ﬁnals,
they were defeated 5-3, ending
with second place ﬁnish.

“Basically, whenever Emory
is in a National Championship
ﬁnal, they bring another level
that you’ve never seen before,”
Wortham said. “I think that I,
personally, was not as prepared
for the moment as I should have
been. But, it’s a new year, and we
are focusing on what we can do
this year. You can’t do anything
about the past.”

The team has spent time this
year analyzing its mistakes and
preparing both mentally and
physically for the competition
this season.

“We’ve really focused on one
match at a time, and we haven’t
really thought about Nationals

 

and getting there and how far
we’re going to get,” Mabry said.
“Whether that’s the next ODAC
match, or whether it is the next
big match against Sewanee next
weekend, we really have to work
hard now, because that’s all that
we can control.”

April 16, the Generals de-
feated Emory at an Invitational in
Atlanta.

“It was so exciting,” Tabb said.
“It was the ﬁrst time in four years
to ﬁnally beat them.”

According to Rankin, the
goal for each girl is to play every
match with the intensity as though
it were the most important.

“Sometimes you want it so
much that you psych yourself
out,” Tabb said. “You want to win
something in particular so much
that you have trouble perform-
ing. It’s hard to focus and make
it seem like just another match-
something you’ve done the whole
season.”

During Spring Break, the team
underwent high intensity training
in preparation for ODACs and po-
tential post-season competition.

“It was probably one of the
hardest weeks that I’ve ever been
through in my tennis career,”
Tabb said. “It really paid off. We
did really well at our Emory Invi-
tational.”

As the time before Nationals
approaches, Rankin will cater
more towards the speciﬁc needs
of each athlete.

“You have to work as individ-
uals to make the strongest team,”
she said. “We will be tailoring all

of the practices to the individu-
als.”

According to Weston, the per-
sonalities on the team contribute
to its broad success.

“We’re deﬁnitely a tight-knit
group,” she said. “Overall, we
had an amazing team last year,
but this year, I think our team is
just as strong, maybe stronger.”

Kingsbury said the work ethic
also strengthens the team.

“We all try hard in practice,”
she said. “Everyone brings 100
percent. I think that’s why we
are deep. Everyone motivates
each other and themselves con-
stantly.”

According to Kingsbury,
assistant coach Curt Speersch-
neider designs a theme for each
season. This year, the motto is
“trust”.

“It can mean a number of
things,” Kingsbury said. “Trust
your own abilities. Trust your
teammates abilities. Trust that
you can win.”

May 6 and 7 mark the ﬁrst
two rounds of Nationals with the
location pending. The following
rounds of team Nationals will be
held in Santa Cruz, California
beginning May 17.

Individual Nationals will take
place at the same location start-
ing May 20. Individual athletes
will receive bids on May 1.

“We know we can perform,”
Tabb said. ‘‘I think that’s our
main strength in winning and
competing well.”
