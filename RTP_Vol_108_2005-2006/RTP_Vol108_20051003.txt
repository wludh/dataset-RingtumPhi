SIMPLE LIFE

With the growing pres-
ence of digital cameras
and camera phones,
photos are becoming
more prevalent. Here
are some ways to make
sure you can preserve
your memories and look
your best.

Avoid red-eye.
Look directly into a light until
just before the photo is taken.

and therefore the amount of
glare from the ﬂash.

Create a slim silhouette.
Turn your body to a 45-degree
angle as you pose. This em-
phasizes your waist and slen-
derizes your line.

Reduce shine.

Use transculent powder to ab-
sorb the oil that reﬂects light
from the camera ﬂash.

Compose yourself.

Make sure to stand up
straight, with shoulders back.
This creates a more positive
look, so you don’t look bored
or lazy.

Loosen up.

Joke, laugh, make a
face...whatever it takes to re-
lax your facial features. Try
not to make your smile look
too posed or forced.

Know your good side.
Since no one’s face is totally
symmetrical, you have one.
Find out what it is, and make
sure it’s facing the camera for
the best possible angle.

As thenumber of Williams school majors continues to grow, competing departments may suffer

By Wes O’De|I
REPORTER

To some, it might seem para-
doxical that one of the nation’s top
liberal arts institutions boasts a
thriving school of school of busi-
ness.

But the century-old Williams
School of Commerce, Economics
and Politics has excelled in its
unusual niche, expanding its fa-
cilities, increasing its faculty and
providing a variety of unique re-
search and study-abroad programs
for its students, growing to the
point that 40% of W&L students
now take a major from it.

Prof. Larry Peppers, Dean of
the School, credits the quality of
the school for its success and
growth.

Becoming bigger in a physical
sense, however, may be a neces-
sity. The School’s strategic plan

calls for the construction of new
facilities or the renovation of the
old co-op to house currently dis-
placed faculty and staff.

“We have a lot of faculty at this
point in time that are spread out
all over campus,” he said.

Both space and money, how-
ever, are at a premium at W&L,
and the opinions regarding which
building should be the next reno-
vated are as diverse as the depart-
ment chairs themselves.

He singles out Newcomb Hall,
which he says needs to be “taken
back to the rafters and
rebuilt. . .We’re just bursting at the
seams.”

He implicates the successive
renovations of Huntley Hall as
evidence of the C-school beneﬁt-
ing at the expense of the college,
but is quick to point out that “it’s
not just [them], I’m not trying to
set them up as a target,” mention-

ing also recent construction in the
departments of journalism, sci-
ence and law, which he says have
faired “extremely well.”

“We’ve gotten far, far less than
we need and deserve,” he contin-
ued, “we [in the humanities] have
been treated like poor relations.”

Prof. James Warren, Chair of
the English Dept., points out that
while both the College and the
Williams School beneﬁt from any
renovations, the renovation of the
Leybum Library “is frankly more
important to me than the C-school,
which already has a nice building.
And we won’t even talk about
Reid Hall, wonderful as it is.”

Faculty and staffing issues are
also contentious.

The History department, ac-
cording to Prof. Merchant, is un-
derstaffed by three professors, and
the upcoming teaching load reduc-
tion from seven to six courses

Fraternities react effectively to threat of :armedvdeserter..

A party at thejsigrna Chi
fraternity house was disrupted
two weeks ago by an armed
man. -
Daniel McCellan, who is 35

, years old, is currently wanted
by the United States Navy for
desertion. When he was ar-
rested in front of Kappa Sigma,
he wasdiscovered to be carry-
ing a Berretta .380 caliber pis-
tol, a clip of bullets and two
knives.

He did not, however, show
these weapons while he was
inside the fraternity house.

Bruce Beard, Lex'mgton’s
Chief of Police, said the in-
truder was in the custody of
W&L Security Officer Larry
Stewart when two officers ar-

. rived at 12:15 am. on Satur-
day, September 17"‘.

Stewart went to the house

‘shortly after an officer of

Sigma Chi had asked McCellan to
leave the fraternity’s property and
the trespasser “bolted when con-
fronted.”

Noticing the strong smell of
alcohol and the glazed look in
Stewart’s eyes, the police arrested
him on charges of trespassing and
being drunk in public (DIP).

While searching McCel1an, the
officers discovered the pistol and

knives, so a warrant for the charge‘

of carrying a concealed weapon
was promptly obtained.

Upon returning to the station,
the police discovered that
McCellan, who listed a Sarasota,
Florida address as his current resi~
deuce, is wanted by the Navy on
desertion charges. ,

‘ After getting in touch with
military police, Beard says the
department was asked to “hold
onto him until the government
authorities could come get him.”

The Chief said that McCe1lan
may never stand trial ‘in

Rockbridge County because of the ‘

qfederal desertion charge,

which receives priority over“;

any s_tate.critne_s. — .

Michael Young, W&L’s 'Di- I
rector of Canipus Security  -
a military veteran, notedthat

_“the government‘ ‘doesn.’t look
“too kindlyon people who

desert during a war. lie could I
be looking at 20 years in prison

V Chief Beard -emphasized V
that even Lexington is not im-by "

Beard further emphasized
that he hopes this incident will

eially female ones, to take care“ 1

threatens course offerings in some
departments unless new faculty
are hired to preserve current
courses.

However, Prof. William Ses-
sions, Philosophy Dept.
Chair,points out that the college’s
liberal arts focus goes hand in
hand with that of the Williams
school, saying “liberal learning...
turns out to be the most
useful. . .for leaders.”

.In the midst of these economic
issues lies the central paradox of
a business school within a nation-
ally-ranked liberal arts institution.

Prof. Merchant expressed dis-
tress that too large a percentage of
C-school majors will cause W&L
to lose its standing in national
polls as a small liberal arts school.

Prof. Sessions agreed, saying,
“the number of applied area ma-
jors shouldn’t be overwhelming,”
while adding that the percentage

of students taking majors from the
C-school can be misleading, as
many double major in the college.

University Registrar Scott
Dittman reports that 28% of last
year’s graduating C-school majors
also took a major in the college.

He did, however, concede the
recruitment draw of the C-school,
while adding, “you would never
want to see the day that W&L
would be looked at as a business
school first and a liberal arts col-
lege second...that would be sad.”

The faculty remain united in
their feeling that any improvement
beneﬁts the whole.

The general feeling of the fac-
ulty was summed up by Prof. Ses-
sions, who said, “It’s extremely
important not to get into an
adversarial or antagonistic rela-
tionship here and to think this is a
zero—sum game where their gain is
our loss.”

Ventura brings controversial views to the pulpit

By Mallory Ruymann
REPORTE R

Jesse Ventura is a man of
many faces.

For example, he is a naval
officer, former pro—wrest1er, and
a former governor, which he
described as a transient phase in
his life

Why Jesse Ventura at W&L
many ask? Said CONTACT
Vice—Chair for Finance Dave
Kronenﬁeld; “There were some
on the Committee who thought
he would be a good speaker, and
that thought for the price
[$35,000] he was a large name
for what we are paying for him.
I think he’s going to be an
interesting speaker.”

In the latest stage of his life,
Jesse Ventura seems to have
adopted a look that mirrors his
freedom of political thought.

This “amazing experiment,”
has proved to Ventura that

“people judge based on looks,”
something which some in the
audience did on Tuesday night
before they heard Ventura speak.

Said Jack Zampoln ’09, “His
attire was ridiculous.

“I mean Lee’s buried directly
behind him, he’s wearing a Che
Guevara t-shirt. I swear to God,
Lee must be rolling over in his
grave.”

"Said Jim McDougal ’07, “I
thought he was very charismatic
and he had a lot of interesting
things to say about the way our
government was run.

“He was a little crass...He
called himself an Independent, but
I guess he would be a Libertarian
because he said he was socially
liberal but ﬁscally conservative.”

Despite some bad jokes and
inappropriate insinuations, most
students would agree that Jesse
Ventura’s was something they

were glad they did not miss.

Going the green mile

After a week of hearings, the EC deals out the dough to select student organizations with mixed reactions

This week, many student organizations laid their claim

to EC Budget money. With a new, simpler system of

application and interview, the EC tried their best to be

fair to all clubs. However, as the philosopher Jagger

once said, “You can’t always get what you want.”

Hopefully these organizations got what they needed.

By Sarah Kientz
RE PO RTE R

In 1796, George Washington
saved our school from possible
oblivion with an donation valued
at $20,000.

Now, the gift remains part of
the University’s endowment, ex-
ceeding $500,000. As Washington
showed us, a little faith and gen-
erosity goes a long way. Although
a little less serious than saving the
University, the Executive Com-
mittee allocates money to student
clubs and organizations each fall,
and often their generosity is felt
by some more than others.

The budgeting process, though
reformed in order to make the pro-
cess less time—consuming, ran
smoothly and yielded satisfactory
results for most student organiza-
tions.

Senior Charlie Yates, EC Presi-
dent, said each student organiza-
tion has the same opportunity to
receive the funds they need for the
coming year. Applications are so-
licited a few weeks before EC
Budget hearings, during which
time each organization has an in-
terview in order for the commit-
tee to ask questions. Yates said
there are about 50 organizations
looking to receive some share of
the $400,000 the EC had to allo-
cate.

- Yates stressed that this fall
changes in the allocation process
were made in order to make the
procedure smoother and stressing
the importance of each organiza-
tion knowing the budgeting pro-

cess. Last spring, Yates told orga-
nization leaders that if they went
to a leadership conference to learn
how the budgeting policy works,
they may be favored when it came
time for the fall allocations.

“I really is key that organiza-
tions understand the process. It is
really simple, you just need to take
a few minutes to familiarize your-
self with it,” Yates said.

Senior EC Vice President
Wheeler Sparks said that in order
to improve the allocation process,
the time of each interview was
shortened so that organization
leaders did not spend time repeat-
ing what EC members already
knew.

“We devised a way to combine
interview times so that the groups
that ran over the time limit would
have a chance to borrow from the
groups that ran under,” Sparks
said. “In years past, everyone was
allocated a set time so you could
never gain ground, you could only
give it up. We scheduled to finish
earlier both nights this year, and

for the first time I have ever wit-
nessed we had time to spare.”

In addition to making sure or-
ganizations know the budgeting
process and allotting them time to
make their case, EC members also
have to make the important deci-
sions on which organizations re-
ceive what amount of money.
Yates said each individual EC
member uses his or her own judg-
ment when evaluating each
organization’s proposal.

“Personally, I look at whether
the organization has done a good
job in the past and how wide of
an impact it has on the student
body,” Yates said, “though smaller
organizations that use the money
efficiently are also considered im-
portant.”

Sparks said many factors go
into the decision-making process
for him.

“I like to see an organization
that pays attention to the policies,
doesn’t ask for us to fund things
that we cannot, is succinct but in-
formative in its explanation, and
leaves enough time to answer any
questions we have about the re-
quest or the organization itself,”
Sparks said.

Sparks also stressed that detail
was key in ensuring a club would
receive the amount of funds it was
looking for, although receiving
the exact amount of money re-
quested was rare.

“It seems like most students
carry cell phones these days,”
he added, “so if they see any-
thing that worries them they
shouldn’t hesitate to just dial
up 911.”

Chad Thomas, Senior Jus-
tice of the Inter Fraternity
Council and a member of
Kappa Sigma, reported that
Sgt. Miller of the Lexington
Police spoke to the IFC about
the importance of party safety.

“Sgt. Miller really talked
about the importance of hav-

Police arrest at frat

ing your sober ofﬁcers and se-
curity around,” Thomas said.
“He mentioned that there are
more outsiders near campus
these days.”

The Senior Justice further
said that the fraternities are re-
viewing how they secure their
houses during normal — or non-
party — hours.

Beard said he isn’t sure why
Daniel McCellan showed up in
Davidson Park on that Friday
night. “Maybe he’s a drifter.
All sorts of crazy people can

' come off of the interstate and
into town. It’s just hard to say

“More detail means less
ambiguity. The more ambiguity a
request has, the easier it is for us
to slash the budget,” Sparks said.
“However, almost no organization
receives exactly what it requests.
The only proposal that did was
modest and accurate, with noble
intentions and a great track
record.”

Sparks could not reveal which
organization received the exact
amount of funds it asked for.

The budget allocation report,
which appeared in Campus No-
tices on Wednesday, revealed that
the EC had allocated $ 402,038.24
to 53 student clubs and organiza-
tions. The three clubs that received
the most funds were the Contact
Committee, receiving $74,000;
the Student Bar Association, get-
ting $90,000; and the Generals
Activity Board (GAB) with
$115,000.

Senior Allan Galis, co-presi-
dent of the GAB, said that he
stressed to the EC that the GAB
has been working to provide
events and entertainment to ac-

commodate a large number of

W&L students, including popular
musical acts.

“Last year we overhauled SAB
by including many activities in the
commons to provide activities for
as many students as possible.

Galis said. “It also became obvi-

ous that, in order to get big name
bands to play at a tiny school in
rural Virginia, the costs were go-
ing to be higher than normal so
the bands could be rerouted from
their typical venues in larger cit-
ies. In short, providing quality
student entertainment is expen-
sive.”

Galis said that receiving the
$115,000 was a walk in the park.

“It wasn’t too stressful for us.
Not too much paper work and a
short, 5 minute presentation,”
Galis said. “Pretty easy.”

For other clubs, receiving the
money they needed was not quite
as easy. Senior Katie Babcock,
president of Habitat for Human-
ity, was disappointed that the EC
allocated only $2000 to the club
that received $7000 in the fall of
2004. Babcock admitted that in
2004 the club needed more money
to pay off the debt they were in
from participating in an expensive
building project.

“Because we are no longer in
debt, I think the EC felt as though
there wasn’t as pressing a need for
habitat to be given so much cash,”
Babcock said.

Babcock added that Habitat
asked for $12,000 this fall, and
was “pretty disappointed that we
only received $2,000, especially
because we need to raise $25,000
this year to build a new home.”
She hopes to make up the loss dur-
ing the winter term allocations
and through fundraising through-
out the fall.

“It was quite a blow to our
chapter, especially since we do so
much fundraising on our own any-
way—much more than most of
the organizations on campus,”

Babcock said. “There is such little
overhead with habitat’s costs, so
it’s sad to see that we can’t use
more money to efﬁciently support
the community.”

Despite the EC’s lack of finan-
cial support for Habitat, Babcock
still has a lot of respect for the
committee. However, she hopes to
see improvements in the alloca-
tion process in the future.

“We are grateful for every dol-
lar [the EC] can give us,” Babcock
said. “However, I wished that we
were given an opportunity to
speak before they asked us ques-
tions. We weren’t able to,convey
the fact that over 75 applications
for homes were completed just
from January-June, and that there
are probably 550-650 eligible
families in our county who would
be interested in receiving a home.
Had we been given an opportu-
nity to present these facts, I think
it would have made more sense
to the EC as to why we wanted so
much money.”

Overall, Yates said that al-
though budget allocations can al-
ways be improved, the most im-
portant thing for the EC is know-
ing the money they allocate wiH
be put to good use.

“Nothing’s ﬂawless, and we’re
always trying to make it better,”
Yates said. “Sometimes groups
come in and request money but
then don’t use it. We want to make
sure we’re giving to people who
will put it to good use.”

With the EC’s help, many carn-
pus clubs and organizations will
be able to provide entertainment,
discussions, and service activities
to accommodate the needs of the
entire student body.

Rugby scores big
in new season

Despite setbacks, team expects success

By Doug Sweeney
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s club
rugby team, the Screaming Minks,
defeated Harnpden-Sydney in
their first game of the year. The
September 17 contest was not
even close as the Minks trounced
the Tigers 78-20. The scoring was
led by juniors Jamie Blake and
Tino Tovo. Both men had 3 scores
apiece.

The Minks hope that this open-
ing victory is a sign of things to
come in the 2005 season. The club
struggled last year going 2-4 and
missing the Ed Lee Invitational
Tournament, Virginia Rugby’s
postseason.

Last year’s campaign ended in
disappointment for the Minks de-
spite the efforts of the class of
2005. It will be tough for the
squad to replace the likes of cap-
tain Rory Dowling, hooker George
Craft and fan favorite Mike
Diverio

The 2005 Minks return a solid
core of players who hope to
eclipse last year’s record. The
squad is captained by seniors Rob-
ert Decosimo, Richard Bruno and
junior Tino Tovo. Decosimo is a
strong on-field leader who plays
the ﬂanker position, he is also the
club’s president. Bruno will step
into the shoes of Craft at the
hooker position and Tovo is a
smart heads-up player from Ar-
gentina. Also returning is the hard
hitting Tucker Lafﬁtte who looks
to dish out more pain in 2005.

Unfortunately the Minks have
had to deal with at least one
offseason injury. Sophomore Ian
Handerhan broke his collarbone
while playing rugby this summer.
Handerhan, a starter last season,
hopes to return in time for the
October 22 contest against
Longwood. The sophomore is tak-
ing his injury like a champ. “I’m
just helping out so I can still be
part of the team,” said Handerhan,
“it’s a slow process, a waiting

game and I’m looking forward to
playing.” ,

There are several new members
to the team who look to have an
impact this year. The hero from the
first game Jamie Blake is a junior
exchange student from St.
Andrews in Scotland. Opposing
squads are already nervous about
this Scot whose talent is only
eclipsed by his knowledge of the
game. Senior David Will is trad-
ing in his high tops for cleats as
he makes the transition from var-
sity basketball to rugby. Will gives
the Minks tremendous size (6’6”,
225) and athleticism.

The club will also receive a
shot in the arm from a strong
freshman class led by Hansen
Babington. These frosh may be
inexperienced but they have re-
markable enthusiasm and energy.

The Minks coaching staff also
made an addition in the offseason.
Helping out head coach Tom
Lovell will be law student Tom
Good. Lovell is a Washington and
Lee alum who graduated in 1991.

While the Minks work hard on
the pitch they work just as hard
off it as evidenced by their annual
fund raiser, the player auction.
This auction involves team mem-
bers putting themselves on sale to
be pledges for a day with proceeds
going to support the club. Even
the team’s name is a reminder of
the work ethic of these men. The
origin of the name, according to
their website, is proof enough:
“Legend has it that W&L rugby
players would wait outside the
VMI barracks for the cadets and
their girls to come back from their
dates. As the ladies were not al-
lowed into the barracks the W&L
rugby players were so kind to es-
con them back home. Thus they
received the name ‘Minks’.”

. The club looks to continue it’s
winning ways this Saturday when
the travel to UNC Greensboro.
The Minks next home game is
Ocotober 8 against the Rams of
VCU.

Sophomore Alice Shih never
thought she would ride a horse
competitively. Now she competes
as a varsity athlete for Washing-
ton and Lee University’s riding
team.

Shih was just looking for a way
to spend her free time in college.
“I first tried out for the team be-
cause all of my ‘new’ friends at
W&L also tried out,” explained
Shih of her unanticipated decision
to ride. “Once I made the team, I
realized how fun and amazing
riding is.”

“You have to have ‘people of all
ability levels and Alice Shih is a
great example,” said senior Cap-
tain Katie Goodrich of her team-

mate. “Riding is completely dif-
ferent from most varsity sports in
that we actually need people to
walk on the team.”

W&L riders competing at the
collegiate level are broken into
competition levels based on abil-
ity.

The team must provide riders
in the open, intermediate, novice,
walk-trot-cantor, and wa1k—trot
categories. Shih competes at the
most basic level— the walk-trot.

“Open riders have been riding
the longest and require the most
experience,” said Goodrich. “But
when it comes down to it, the be-
ginning riders can Seam the same
amount of points.”

To make the sport even more
complex, riders are never guaran-
teed a given horse. When the team

travels, they depend on the host-
ing team to provide horses. “You
draw a name of a horse out of a
hat right before you compete,”
said Goodrich. “There's no such
thing as warm—up or practice, you
just have to hope you got a good
horse.”

Coach Amy Reistrup helps
them through. I reallly like
Amy...she brings a sense of ease
to the team. Especially in times of
competition, everyone is much
more relaxed.”

Shih attributes the combination
of good coaching and leadership
from captains to the success of the
team. “The captains are great
leaders for me team...constantly
engaging every member of the
team, which is hard to do since we
don’t practice together.”

Let s talk about sex

Students, speakers and the school weigh in on how to eliminate sexual misconduct and improve gender relations

By Kate Shellnutt

STAFF WRITER

What’s going on?

Sex. It’s a good thing, right?
Sarah Jessica Parker and company
show that it’s fun in the city.
Marcy’s Playground lets us know
it’s good with candy. It sells jeans.
And lingerie. And perfume.

But outside of entertain-
ment and advertising, sex can ex-
ist in the real world as something
much darker: abuse, battery, rape,
and violence.

Like other college cam-
puses, Washington and Lee has to
address the occurrence of sexual
violence among its students.

Unlike other college cam-
puses, Washington and Lee has to
deal with these problems occur-
ring at up to double the national
average.

After an American College
Health Association survey re-
vealed these statistics last year, the
university has reacted, not only by
questioning the incidences, but
also by doing all it can to create a
more positive, safe environment
for both men and women at the
school.

Washington and Lee has
taken action, from offering coun-
seling services to forming student

groups to hosting speakers on the

topic.

That’s where Bob Hall, who
held a lecture on nonviolent sexu-
ality in the Commons theater on
Thursday, comes in.

Sponsored by the Gender
Relations Committee (GRC),
LIFE, and One in Four, Hal1’s
message confirms the need for
communication between the gen-
ders.

“What is appropriate?” and
“how do you deﬁne ‘consent?’”
are not just questions that should
be on posters around campus, but
also on the minds of students.

What the speaker had to say

He is educated in “conflict
studies.” He’s been speaking on
the topic for 18 years.

He uses humor and facts in-
stead of judgements to educate on
sexuality.

He opens the lecture by act-
ing out an end-of—the-night scene
on a couch on stage with a mem-
ber of the audience.

. If that’s not enough to make
you listen to his “How not to get
run over by your DRIVE” talk, he
also sounds just like Wallace
Shawn (Vizzini from “The Prin-
cess Bride” and Mr. Hall from
“Clueless”).

With innuendoes, puns, and
a mile-a-minute verbiage, Bob
Hall makes important points about

“Generally speaking, in our society, we seem open enough

to exploit [sex] and make money 0}?’ it, but not enough to deal

with it in real life.”

BOB HALL, on non-violent sexuality

sexual violence, the number one
violent crime on college cam-
puses.

~ Hall encouraged couples to
reduce unwilling sexual touching
or activity by openly discussing
sex instead of “silencing dialog
and hoping for the best” and ar-
gues that the reason people hesi-
tate to discuss the topic are their
differences in sexual education.

At Washington and Lee, stu-
dents come from so many differ-
ent parochial and public schools,
religions, cultures, and regions of
the country.

The diversity of backgrounds
certainly could contribute to the
confusion involving hooking up,
dating, and sexual relations on
campus.

What the school has to say

The University Policy on
Prohibited Student Discrimina-

tion, Harassment, and Sexual
Misconduct begins with this sen-
tence, “Washington and Lee Uni-
versity is a community based on
trust and respect for others,” and
continues to explain how these
actions do not belong in the W&L
community.

Yet, the statistics from last
year’s survey exist: 22.6% of
women having experienced
sexual touching against their will
and 8.5% attempted sexual pen-
etration against their will.

Jan Kaufman, One in Four,
LIFE, and the GRC advisor, plans
on continuing to track these num-
bers.

She hopes to see changes
this year thanks to student action
against sexual misconduct and
school—sponsored programming
like Bob Hall’s lecture.

“His message builds upon
the work of the GRC especially,”

said Kaufman. “Our goal is to
increase interactions between
sexes, and we would like students
to understand healthy dynamics
and relationships.”

The GRC’s slate of activities
also includes Date Night and fur-
ther discussion on the deﬁnition
of consent.

“Students are going to click
on as they begin to hear more and
more,” she continued.

“It is incumbent on all stu-
dents to look out for their friends,
to begin standing up and speak-
ing up against these things.”

What the students have to say

Like Jan Kaufman men-
tioned, the change in the culture
and the reduction of sexual mis-
conduct depends on the action of
W&L students.

Allison Stokan, a junior Peer
Counselor, recognizes the student

population’s struggle, whether
due to intoxication or campus
conventions, to communicate
openly about sex.

“Alcohol and drugs both im- ‘

pair the operation of the mind and
can inﬂuence people to engage in
behavior they wouldn’t nor-
mally,” she said.

“Also, our school is very
conforrnist and this may be shown
in emotionally abusive relation-
ships.”

Students assume the party
scene leads to a “hookup culture,”
where fewer students date.

“‘Hooking up’ at W&L is a
disadvantage for all students be-
cause it can be so awkward,” ad-
mits Courtney Fitzgerald, co-
chair of the GRC.

“The GRC hopes to provide
men and women more opportu-
nities to interact without drinking
as the main form of entertain-
ment.”

A note about statistics.‘

All statistics come from the Na-
tional College Health Assessment
Survey, conducted in March
2004.

Philosophy and feminism

First female philosophy professor at W&L gives up law practice to find happiness in the classroom

By Steph Wiechmann

STAFF WRITER

Melina Bell knows what it’s
like to start over. She knows how
following the wrong path can lead
you to a career you hate with a
miserable schedule. She has
learned what-it takes to pick your-
self up, backtrack to the fork in
the road, and choose again.

Before appearing at Washing-
ton and Lee as the first female pro-
fessor in our philosophy depart-
ment, Bell entered the workforce
as lawyer.

While her heart was in the right
place, Bell found out that she was
happier in the classroom than the
conference room.

Bell’s path forked during her
last year of undergraduate college
in Long Island, NY.

While completing her bach-
elors degree in philosophy at
Hoftstra University, she had to
decide between law school or phi-
losophy graduate school.

It was not an easy decision, as
she could see herself in both pro-
fessions.

“My professors said that I
would never make any money as
a professor of philosophy,” she
said.

Bell then decided that law
school was the way to go. She had
ambitions to practice health law.
She began a program at the Bos-
ton School of Public Health.

At the end of this dual pro-
gram, Bell received both a juris
doctorate to practice law and a
masters degree in public health.

After interning at the Massa-
chusetts Board of Medicine in the
summer, Bell was hired at a large
legal firm in Boston, practicing
large healthcare law.

While she seemed to have it all,
Bell did not find the excitement
or satisfaction she was looking for.

“The hours were just awful,”
she said of her law career.

She would get to the ofﬁce,
ready to work, at 7 a.m. Some-
times she would get to leave at 9
p.m., but on days with large case-
loads, she would not leave the of-
ﬁce until midnight.

“I was happy on Saturdays be-
cause I got to leave at 5 [p.m.],”

she said.

The junior lawyer was also dis-
appointed with the direction her
law practice was taking her.

While practicing large
healthcare law, Bell felt more like
she was practicing business law.

“I thought it was going to be
more service-driven,” she said.

Bored and overworked, Bell
took some thought to critiques
given to her writing style. Col-
leagues would tell her, “don’t phi-
losophize” when she was writing
her briefs.

Bell then made the tough deci-
sion to end her law career and
head back to graduate school in
hopes of becoming a philosophy
professor.

Though apprehensive, Bell de-
cided to pursue her masters degree
in philosophy from Tufts Univer-
sity in Boston.

“I didn’t want to embark on an-
other career that would lead me
nowhere,” she said of her deci-
sion.

Nonetheless, Bell graduated
and headed to the University of

 

“My professors said that I would never

make any money as a professor of

philosophy . . . But I ’ve found that it’s

just not that important compared to the

quality of life.”

M E L l NA B E L L, A ' Professor of Psychology

Pennsylvania to obtain a Ph. D.
in Philosophy — a degree she com-
pleted in May of 2005.

With all of her qualiﬁcations
in order, she set out to ﬁnd a job
that she hoped would give her the
satisfaction she had never found.

Using the publication “Jobs for
Philosophers,” she stumbled
across a posting by Washington
and Lee for a feminist political
philosophy professor.

Bell’s ideal choice would be a
small, liberal arts school, so she
applied for the job.

When she was hired, she was
excited by W&L’s emphasis on
teaching.

“I don’t like the research em-
phasis as much,” she said when
choosing which postings to apply
for. “I wanted to be primarily a
teacher.”

She found working as a pro-
fessor and with students pleased
her in a way that her law practice
did not.

“Adults can be cynical and
jaded be cause of the experiences
they’ve had,” Bell said. “People

here are cheerful, optimistic, ide-
alistic, and have a sense of hu-
mor.”

As well as she gets along with
the students, Bell also enjoys
workin g with the other professors
in the philosophy department,
where she is the only woman.

Bell said that her gender is not
an issue within the department.

“My colleagues have attitudes
enlightened by sex equality,” said
the philosophy professor. “There

What a difference

a dorm makes

Students banter about pros and cons of freshmen residence halls

By Rebecca Koval
and Casidhe Horan
STAFF WRITER

Are all dorms created
equal? Students in
Graham-Lees tend to be
lively and loud, while
students in the BGD quad
are more mellow. There
is a constant party on one
side of Washington Street,
and constant studying on
the other. Myth or reality?
Admissions plot or

coincidental?

Fire alarms at two o’clock in
the morning, anatomically ex-
aggerated body parts strewn
across walls and white boards,
blaring music at all hours of the
night- these are just some of the
myriad joys made possible by
life in the freshmen dorms.

Ask any student, past or
present, and he or she will tell
you: all residence halls are not
created equal.

Oh, yes, we are all provided
with the same modern conve-
niences, (i.e. indoor plumbing
and the like) but, obviously,
something very strange happens
when one crosses Washington
Street.

The atmosphere of the quad
versus Graham-Lees is intrinsi-
cally different in terms of the
activity levels.

It is not the appearance of in-
room sinks. The disparity, then,
clearly lies in the “individua1i—
ties” of Baker/Davis/Gilliam
and Graham-Lees and the stu-
dents who live in them.

Now, perhaps it is all the

All the people who crash in the quad are actually traveling

Any idiot will tell you it is a ridiculous wish to expect to ﬁnd

solace in Graham-Lees and it is equally moronic to hope for

a spontaneous gathering of any substance in the quad.

 

endless corridors and dispropor-
tionate ﬂights of stairs that make
the ladies and gentlemen of Gra-
ham-Lees feel the need to turn
their homey environment into an
all—night dance party.

There is, after all, just some-
thing about getting lost on your
own ﬂoor to prompt a raucous
bacchanal.

The other side of the street
does not seem to have the same
problem.

I could be wrong, but I know
when I wander off to Gilliam to
study Calculus, those BDG
snobs must not be drinking the
same water. ‘

It is like stepping into another
dimension. Not only do I con-
serve breath from climbing
fewer stairs, I also avoid the n1is—
haps of aimless bumbling into
foreign halls.

Not only this, but the college
din seems to be calmed over
yonder.

However, this could be attrib-
uted to the fact that all the people
who crash in the quad are actu-
ally traveling over to Graham-
Lees and living it up in the laby-
rinth. »

How could such a difference
exist just mere yards away?

‘ Well, it is not because the
Residential Life ofﬁce is out to
isolate the serious students from
the hooligans.

Dean of Freshman Dave

Leonard said that his office
makes every attempt to match
incoming students with prefer-
ences based on roommate com-
patibility and questions an-
swered on the housing request
forms mailed during the summer.

If a student specifically re-
quests a sink in his or her room,
he or she will be living in Baker,
Gilliam, or Davis, depending
upon room availability.

If the student has requested
substance- free accommoda-
tions, he or she will be placed in
a hall that does not condone the
more festive distractions.

Despite Residential Life’s
best efforts, however, it is hard
to guarantee consistent quiet
hours when nearby floors and
visitors from you—kn0w-where
invade one’s halls in the valiant
attempt to add color and volume
to our otherwise mundane exist-
ences.

Essentially, it all comes down
to living wisely. Any idiot will
tell you it is a ridiculous wish to
expect to find solace in Graham-
Lees, and it is equally moronic
to hope for a spontaneous gath-
ering of any substance in the
quad.

There are, of course, benefits
to both environments. Freshman

   
  
   

Michelle Snyder said that the
BDG quad has “a lot less
people, so it’s a closer knit com-
munity.”

On the other end of the spec-
trum, Jen Sanow said, “Living
in Graham-Lees is great. You
have a lot more opportunities
to meet other freshmen and are
definitely much more in the
center of things.”

The three dorms in the quad
almost make up one third of the
square feet in Graham-Lees.
And our respective environ-
ments do foster a healthy sense
of residential loyalty.

If nothing else, we each have
acquired certain skills neces-
sary for life in the real world.

Freshman Ellie Hanson said,
“[Graham-Lees] really helps
your geography and tracking
skills... I feel better prepared
to be lost in the woods some-
day after the first three weeks
of looking for my dorm room.”

When all is said and done,
both dorms have their advan-
tages. No matter which side of
the street one lives on, loyalty
to one’s home dorm lasts for-

Winning the ﬁreshman vote

Lack of turnout for student speeches and voting represents worrisome school-wide apathy

By Justin McKeen
STAFF COLUMNIST

Given the recent reluctance of
young people to turn up to the
polls in national elections, I guess
it’s probably too much to expect
something as mundane as fresh-
man class elections to elicit much
of a response.

It still seems sad though when I

only a little more than half of the
class votes, and even sadder when
only twenty people show up to
hear the candidates speeches.

In recent days, quite a few of
my friends have told me that they
would have attended the speeches
had they known about them. They
were announced in the campus
notices but, honestly, does anyone
really read those?

Some of the blame then, it
seems fair to say, lies with the in-
effective way in which the event
was advertised.

Furthermore, if you didn’t
make it, you really didn’t miss
much. Ifyou’ve ever heard a high-
school student council speech, you
can pretty faithfully recreate what
was said on Sunday.

The lack of attendance at the
speeches does raise one question
though: if only twenty people
knew the candidates’ platforms
(such as they were), what were the
other 200 or so basing their votes
on?

Yes, Jeremy Wainwright does
have an afro. Yes, he does own a
burgundy-colored suit and a sweet
cowboy hat. But what do any of
these things have to do with stu-

If only twenty people knew the candidates’

platforms (such as they were), what were the

other 200 or so basing their votes on?
 

dent government?

I’m not attacking Jeremy
here—I know him, he’s a nice guy.
I have every conﬁdence that he’ll
be a good President.

But how, at a school named
after George Washington, and
claiming to be one of the best in-
stitutions of higher learning in the
country, do we vote for people
based on (someone actually told
me this) their Beirut skills?

Maybe I’m making too big a
deal out of this. After all, it’s only

a freshman class election.
Everyone’s busy, tl1ere’s partying,
school, usually more partying.
The problem I had is that if
you can’t be bothered to vote (or
vote intelligently) when you
know the candidates personally,
how easy does it become to not
vote in local elections? State elec-
tions? Dare we even say national
ones?
I’m not sure I believe the ru-
mor going around that the fresh-
man class has more liberals than

conservatives, but whatever your
political orientation, voting is one
of your duties as a citizen. People
have suffered and died to estab-
lish and protect our system of gov-
emment.

If you didn’t vote this past
week, or if you’re an upperc1ass-
man (from what I’ve heard, your
elections aren’t exactly blockbust-
ers either), but you get out there
and vote when it means some—
thing, great. You just read this ar-
ticle for nothing.

But for those of you who sit

Not—so—beautifu1 minds

Lack of student discussion on important events shows W&L intellectual culture ends outside of class

On campus, relevant political matters and current

events often take the back seat to the day’s hottest

gossip. At a school that claims to be one of the most

politically active in the nation, students must take steps

to boost their intellectual ﬁrepower.

In honor of Constitution Day
last month, W&L’s School of Law
and the Williams School held a
panel discussion on the John Rob-
erts conﬁrmation hearings. Pro-
fessors analyzed how Roberts’ ap-
pointment to the U.S. Supreme
Court could shape the outcome of
many of the country’s most po-
lemical constitutional battles.

The two schools should be
lauded for hosting this discursive

exploration into an issue of wide-
spread importance. The discus-
sion was pointedly intellectual,
showcasing from a multi—disci—
plinary perspective how and why
the Court operates as it does. At
the same time, the conversation
was engaging and accessible,
even for those without extensive
knowledge of America’s judicial
system.

Unfortunately, these types of
intelligent discussions — on politi-
cal matters, on current events, and
on other consequential topics -
occur far too infrequently on
W&L’s campus. In fact, they are
almost nonexistent.

Although W&L is an excellent
academic school, it sometimes
falls short of being an excellent
intellectual school. This concept
is especially true regarding the
student body’s treatment of politi-
cal issues. For some reason, po-
litically minded students — or, to
quote one of George F. Will’s re-
cent columns in The Washington
Post, “those political snail darters,

the emblematic endangered spe-
cies” — have largely surrendered
their presence on W&L’s campus.

This conclusion is conﬁrmed
to me time and again when a sig-
niﬁcant topic, not necessarily po-
litical in nature, is raised for dis-
cussion in class. Usually profes-
sors ‘are able to generate some in-
sightful, if not revelatory, conver-
sation among students. But when
the bell rings signaling the end of
class, something surprising and, in
my judgment, troubling happens:
The debate promptly ends, as if it
were all nothing more than an
obligatory duty fulﬁlled.

In some respects, this behav-
ior should be expected. After all,
college students have other things
to worry about than Roberts’ po-
sition on eminent domain or
whether he thinks Marbury v.
Madison was correctly decided. It
is not my contention that students
should spend all of their time read-
ing The Economist, listening to
NPR, or watching C-SPAN.
Rather, my point is this: It would
not hurt us, at least sometimes, to
talk about topics other than what
we are doing on Saturday night. It

would not hurt us, at least some— .

times, to be a little more politically
minded.

In calling for students to be
politically minded, I am not sug-
gesting that students should begin
protesting, staging sit-ins, and tak-

ing to the streets of Lexington.
Rather, I am encouraging students
to attempt to become more aware
of the salient political issues sur-
rounding their lives. From there,
students can begin to formulate or
sharpen their opinions and express

I am not suggesting
that students should be-
gin protesting, staging
sit-ins, and taking to
the streets of Lexington.
 

them in a thoughtful manner.

Let me afﬁrm that I am not in
favor of changing the political
culture on campus simply for the
sake of changing the political cul-
ture. Students should not alter
their habits merely to advance
some vague notion of political
ediﬁcation. Otherwise, such en-
gagement would become rote and
tired, much like some academics
in the classroom, which are sim-
ply done for the sake of doing it
as it has always been done.

Instead, students should be-
come involved in politics for more
tangible reasons: to learn the val-
ues of civic virtue and community
participation; to understand how

individuals, groups, and institu-
tions interact to form society; and,
above all, to expose them to issues
and ideas world beyond the nar-
row conﬁnes of Lexington.

How can this best be achieved?

First, students should consider
taking classes that deal specifi-
cally with political issues. Intro-
ductory courses like American
National Government, Political
Philosophy, and Comparative
Government are good places to
start. But students can also chal-
lenge themselves through a wealth
of interdisciplinary classes, nota-
bly those afﬁliated with the Shep-
herd Poverty Program.

Second, there exist several for-
mal outlets for students to effi-
ciently disseminate their views on
a range of topics. Perhaps one of
the best methods is to do exactly
what I am doing right now — writ-
ing in the school newspaper. By
publishing op-eds, students alert
others to various ideas and per-
spectives. Simultaneously, they
provide an impetus for healthy
debate among the student body.

Actually, in posing this ques-
tion, I am just complicating what
is really very simple: The best way
to make a difference on campus
is to be political and have fun.
Students have more power to
change the political culture at
W&L than they could ever real-
ize. It just takes a little effort.

THE RING-TUM PHI - 7

Can New Orleans rise again‘?

Nation’s time and reconstruction money better spent moving all disaster prone cities to more secure locations

By Dane Boston
COLUMNIST

My father has been trying to
convince me that to rebuild New
Orleans again in its current loca-
tion would be foolish, and a waste
of taxpayers’ dollars.

Why spend $250 billion when
another hurricane like Katrina
could quite literally sweep that in-
vestment out to sea?

The trend appears to indicate
that we will see such a storm.

I did my best to hold up the cul-
ture of New Orleans, the city’s sig-
nificant place in

American history, and the ex-
ceptional opportunity of salvaging
the Big Easy’s treasures while si-
multaneously correcting its prob-
lems.

I pleaded, “What ' about
beignets, and jazz, and the French
Quarter?”

“ What about Mardi Gras?!”

But in the end, sentimentalism
could not stand against dollars and
cents sense.

At first I felt bad about relent-
ing to my dad’s econon1ically-fo-
cused assault.

But my faculties of reason
could not mount a sufficient re-
buttal.

Indeed, my faculties of reason
betrayed my original position a
short while into .the argument.

What sense does it make to
build a city below sea level?

Levees are bound to break.

No feat of engineering genius
could make them stand forever.

Another hurricane could leave
the city of New Orleans in an even
worse position.

The only logical solution:
move it.

Reason, once released from the
stiﬂing conﬁnes of base emotion,
has an inclination (as strong as

The only reasonable solution to the problem

of whether or not to rebuild New Orleans is

simple: we must move all of our national

treasures to the relative safety of the moon.

water ﬂowing into a low lying
area) to set all mistakes of judg-
ment right.

Thus did my reason proceed

. uninhibited, after vanquishing the

petty problem of New Orleans.
As a Floridian, I know first-

hand the dangerous and unpre-

dictable nature of hurricanes.

It is quite impossible to tell
where they are going and how
strong they will be when they ar-
rive.

They carry in their swirling
winds an enormous potential for
damage.

And practically no location on
the Gulf or Atlantic coasts is safe.

How can we avoid the tremen-
dous costs that a major hurricane
could incur making landfall near
an important city?

The only reasonable course we
have: move our cities.

Too many lie along the dis-
tressingly exposed eastern sea-

board, and should summarily
move inland.

My home state must be emp-
tied in her sunny entirety.

The cost may be tremendous,
but compared to the cost of clean-
ing up after a vicious storm (which
would include a cost in human
life, fortuitously avoided in pre-
emption), it is a pittance.

But can we reasonably stop at
the possibility of hurricanes along
the east coast?

Much of the Midwest, the
“Heartland,” is vulnerable to
ﬂooding from the Mississippi
River, or disastrous tornadoes.

In addition, I understand the
“Dust Bowl” was unpleasant.

The Paciﬁc coast, mercifully
free of hurricanes, is unfortunately
prone to cataclysmic earthquakes.

And, regretfully, we now
know that no part of the country
is beyond a doubt safe from the
reach of terrorists.

All of these threats demand to
be addressed.

The American taxpayers must
be spared the anguish of funding
innumerable reconstruction
projects around the country.

Conveniently, a plausible an-
swer was found in this very paper
a short time ago...

The only reasonable solution to
the problem of whether or not to
rebuild New Orleans is simple: we
must move all of our national trea-
sures to the relative safety of the
moon.

It’s the only reasonable, eco-
nomical course of action.

My father is absolutely correct.
Rebuilding New Orleans would be
an act of sentimental foolishness.

Why waste money on some-
thing as silly as musty history and
gaudy culture?

Review your strategies for getting some action: are they helping or hindering your chance for a hook up?

By Hugh Trout
STAFF COLUMNIST

Before people get angry, al-
low me to remind you that these
are just the grievances and ob-
servations of just one man, no
matter how sexy he may so hap-
pen to be. If you disagree, that’s
fine (you probably eat mayon-
naise and are an Eagles fan any-
way).

While each of us here at W&L
have our own moves, lines,
looks, games, tactics and pre-
ferred levels of intoxication,
there are a few standards when
it comes to getting some action
in Lexington.

Some are good, such as
complimenting your desired
hook up on knowing so much of
the Call on Me dance, others are
not, such as talking about how
fratty it was of you that you
booted and rallied within the last
twenty minutes.

Some strategies remain

Confessions of a ‘Desperate’ mind

Some strategies remain prevalent despite being

crass and poorly implemented. These should

go the way of the XFL and parachute pants . . .

I know all of you who just read the last sentence

must be asking: have I done any of these?
 

prevalent despite being crass and .

poorly implemented. These
should go the way of the XFL
and parachute pants.

And now my dear reader, the
introspective question that I
know all of you who just read the
last sentence must be asking:
have I done any of these?

The answer: almost certainly,
lord knows I have. But if former
head of FEMA Michael Brown
has taught us any lesson it is this:
don’t blame yourself, blame oth-
ers.

Lets begin with the most com-
mon offense: being way more
drunk than the person you are

trying to hook up with.

Man, this one is a classic.
Here is a good way to rational-
ize this one: maybe if the other
person was a little less into
breaking a move to “toxic” you
could have been talking rather
than planning your next super
sweet move with your friends
while downing another fratty
light.

It’s a trap that has caught all
men at one time or another, and
I have certainly seen our females
generals partake in this time hon-
ored tradition.

The saving grace about this
screw up is that while you’re

level intoxication made everyone
else feel very uncomfortable so-
cially, you probably won’t end up
remembering it in the morning.

The next hook up move
that needs to be destroyed is
closely related to the first: the
drunken booty call.

Don’t get me wrong, the so-
ber phone call to try and get some
is amazing and can work won-
ders if it is played well, but the
drunken booty call is as likely to
go well as that time your friends
convinced you that they prom-
ised they would not take your

clothes when you streaked the

house.

Physical desperation can be
masked in a phone call, but it
takes one hundred percent of
your mind.

If you even have had just a
couple drinks, the person will
probably pick up on it and will
always look down on you for it.
There simply is no recovery from
that one.

The next one is short
and very much an increasing
problem: anything to do with
hooking up and facebook is hor-
rible.

You owe yourself and the
other person much more, no mat-
ter how hard you try to rational-
ize your stalking habits.

Case in point: if you didn’t get
their cell number from them, you
are not allowed to call their cell,
no matter how many different
ways you are able to obtain the
number.

There is a hook up tac-
tic and strategy that I certainly
think deserves to get way more
credit than it does.

This special method consists
of using classes to get to know
that special other person.

Then set up a very, very pro-
ductive study group in which you
are able to honestly sell the line
“I study better when it’s one on
one”.

There is nothing like ﬁghting

back against the evil academia

system by using what is forced
upon you to get some action to
come your way.

Well, that’s all I have to say
on the matter, and I hope that no
one is beating themselves up
over committing any of these
hook up blunders because in the
end, it’s all about the participa-
tion award.

The man or woman who fails
isn’t the one who gets blasted,
makes an ass of themselves and
ends up puking outdoors while
the party looks away in disgust.

No, the true failure is the man
or woman who didn’t have to
courage to go up to that special
someone and tell them that they
must have space pants on cuz dat
ass is out of this world.

Nothing beats curling up on the couch with beer and the boys to watch four middle-aged women in aprons

By Marshall Rule
STAFF COLUMNIST

After a few months of hiding,
I am back on the back page. I
would like to apologize ahead of
time to my favorite fan who shall
remain nameless (cough-
AnnieV’sMom-cough), butl will
not be writing every week. . .just
occasionally when I feel in-
spired.

And right now, I am very in-
spired by Sunday nights.

To most people the week is
just buildup to the weekend.
Everyone “Thanks God it’s Fri-
day.” I am not most people.

My week hits a high point
every Sunday night. While ev-

eryone else in school seems to
be in the Library catching up on
the work they did not do over the
weekend, I am in the basement
with a six pack by my side.

It’s something that many men
have trouble admitting. On the
list of things that men will never
confess to, the fact that they en-
joy watching Desperate House-
wives falls somewhere in be-
tween Erectile Dysfunction and
liking fat girls.

However I am one of the few
men who are proud to say that I
love Desperate Housewives.
Every week about ﬁve of us guys
get together to watch the show
that we love (as a side note: we
watch it with our lights on and

I am one of the few men who are proud to say that I

love Desperate Housewives. Every week about ﬁve of

us guys get together to watch the show that we love.

with a girl or two. .. unlike a few
certain guys I know who watch
the OC four to a bed. .. you know
who you are).

I also do not simply watch the
show because Eva Langoria is
hot, but I will say that was a part
of it in the beginning. The show
is about so much more than 4
middle aged sex goddesses,
which is not to say that I
wouldn’t kill for a chance to be

with any one of them.

I have taken online Desper-
ate Housewives quizzes, such as
which Housewife I would most
likely date in the real world (Su-
san. .. 77 percent certainty). I am
getting the first season on DVD
for Christmas (I know this, be-
cause I am planning on buying it
for myself and wrapping it).

What does Desperate House-
wives have that the OC doesn’t

you ask? How about a person
tied up in the basement of the
new neighbors’ house. How
about actors who are the age of
the character that they play.

How about a plot that isn’t
completely predictable. I have
only seen two episodes of the OC
(my girlfriend makes me watch
it... I swear), and even I knew
that the Dean was hooking up
with the one girl who wants to
be social chair.

But I guarantee that nobody
saw that Carlos’ mom was going
to fall down the stairs just 1r1in—
utes after waking up from her
coma.

I realize that I should have to
turn in my “Y Card” for know-

ing the amount of useless infor-
mation I do about the show (for
those of you who don’t know
what the Y card is. .. it’s the card
proving that I have a Y Chromo-
some). But, to be honest, I don’t
care.

I am not afraid to say that I
look at imdb.com at least twice
a week to see if someone has
made any updates to the memo-
rable quotes section. I am not
afraid to say that I surf the web
trying to find out if anyone
knows what’s going to happen in
next week’s episode.

I am coming out of the Des-
perate Housewives closet to you.
Here I am. Accept me for who I
am.
