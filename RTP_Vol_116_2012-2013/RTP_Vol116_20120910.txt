Changing facilities, changing W&L

The 2012-2013 school year arrives with several updates to university facilities and plans for future campus renovations

By Kelly Mae Ross
5 TA F F w R l T E R

Members of the Washington and Lee
community are returning to a slightly updated
campus this fall. The campus will change
even more in the months and years to come.

The University has several renovation
projects lined up, some of which are already
underway.

One of the most noticeable projects
is the multi-year, multi-phase Colonnade
renovation. As of now, work is still being
done on Washington Hall and has already
been completed on Newcomb and Payne
halls.

Tom Kalasky, Director of Capital Projects
at W&L, said the renovation of Washington
Hall is slated for completion by the end of
2012. When the work is done, workers will
move the fencing that is behind the building
to the back of adjacent Robinson Hall.

Work will begin on Robinson in May
2013, after undergraduate commencement.

The Colonnade renovation work includes
“surgically inserting new mechanical and
electrical systems” on the inside of the
buildings, Kalasky said. This includes the
addition of new academic technologies, ﬁre
sprinkler systems and improvements geared
at increasing handicap accessibility.

The work is being paid for, at least in

part, by funds raised through the university’s
$500 million “Honor Our Past, Build Our
Future” capital campaign, launched publicly
in October 2010.

$120.5 million of campaign money has
been slated for physical improvements to
the campus, according to the University’s
website. This includes $50 million for the
Colonnade renovations, $11.5 million for
the construction of a “facility for global
leaming” in a renovated duPont Hall and $50
million for the construction of new indoor
recreation and athletic facilities, according
to the University’s website.

‘Development of community’

Other building projects are also in the
works.

One of these projects is a major renovation
of the Gaines and Graham-Lees residence
halls.

Sidney Evans, Vice President of Student
Affairs and Dean of Students, said the
planned work on Gaines and Graham-Lees
will expand thecapacity of the residence
halls so they will be able to house all first-
year students.

Evans said the University hopes to create
more spaces for studying and socializing
in the buildings to help foster a sense of

community among first-years.

“We feel like right now the ﬁrst-years are
kind of too spread out [in] too many different
facilities,” said Evans.

The ﬁnal plan and budget for the project
have not yet been approved, but Evans said
work is expected to begin in summer 2013
and completed by summer 2015.

Evans said the plan is to make big
changes to the interior of both buildings.
This includes the addition of an elevator and
air-conditioning to Graham-Lees, as well as
upgraded restrooms.

As for Gaines, the interior will basically
be gutted, Evans said.

“lt’s not going to be suite-style anymore,’
she said. “1t’s going to be singles and doubles
with hall baths.”

While many changes are being planned
for the interiors, not much work will be done
to change the buildings’ exteriors.

Evans said the wom-down step leading
into the Graharn-Lees archway, which many
students use to avoid the bad-luck walk
through the center pillars leading to the
archway, will be safe. 1

“Everyone knows that that’s pretty
sacred,” said Evans. “There are some things
you just don’t change.”

‘Always doing little things’

While the renovation of ﬁrst-
year residence halls will not begin
until next summer, there is other
work already taking place on
campus.

“We’re always doing little
things,” said Kalasky.

He said most of the work i
being done this year will not
“significantly impact” student
travel around campus.

Some students have already
noticed work being done on the
first ﬂoor of the Telford Science
Library.

The University is building
an “integrative and quantitative
center,” Kalasky said. This “IQ
Center” will include tools such as
scanning electron microscopes and
computer lab equipment.

“It will be a very technology-
rich environment,” Kalasky said.

Materials formerly located
on the first floor of the Science
Library were moved to Leyburn
Library over the summer, Kalasky
said.

W&L reins in O-Week nightlife

W&L works with the Lexington Police Department to educate students on good behavior and safety on and oﬂcampus

. By Graham Colton

HEAD COPY EDITOR

In light of the arrests during last year’s
Orientation Week, Washington and Lee
University and the Lexington Police
Department joined forces in anticipation
of this year’s O-Week. Their goal, like
the University’s mission, was that students
conduct themselves with honor, integrity,
and civility.

At the panel, these local authorities
spoke to first-year students “to build a
more collaborative relationship,” said Clay
Coleman, Director of Greek and Residential
Life.

According to Jason Rodocker, Assistant
Dean for the First-Year Experience, “This
[was] late enough for new students to be

“No longer is having this degree enough to be suc-

cessful in life. Employers want to know the content

of your character. ”

Al Thomas, Lexington chief of Police

On Sept. 6, after undergraduate classes
began, there was a Law Enforcement Panel
in the Keller Theatre of the Lenfest Center
for the Arts. The panel to discuss student
conduct included Student Judicial Council
Chair Zach Zoller ’l3, Lexington Chief of
Police A1 Thomas and Rockbridge County
Sheriff Chris Blalock.

somewhat familiar with life in Lexington
and sooner than the panel occurred last year.”
Through this formal introduction,
University administration hoped to forestall
conflict between police and students. Rather
than just enforcing the law and creating issues
with arrests, “law enforcement w§ﬁts"‘to be
seen as a resource, ﬁrst,” said Coleman.

Also through this meeting, the Police
Department sought to prevent arrests by
persuading underage students not to drink.

“We wanted to reach [underage students]
before they violate the law,” said Thomas.

According to Thomas, student behavior
during last year ’s O-Week was not noted for
its honor, integrity, or civility. More than other
years, Thomas said that underage students
consumed hard alcohol and mixed drinks

I en route to dangerously high blood alcohol

levels last year.

Thomas said this heavy alcohol
consumption was “combined with belligerent
behavior toward police officers.” This forced
authorities into an enforcement mode.

At the panel, Thomas noted the importance
of student behavior in the community in
combination with their education at W&L.

“No longer is having this degree enough to
be successful in life. Employers want to know
the content of your character,” said Thomas.

The Lexington Police Department would
prefer to prevent crime than punish it,
according to Thomas. “We don’t want to see
arrest numbers increase,” he said.

Thomas said that arrests will decrease
if students‘ communicate with Lexington
residents to agree on parameters for partying.

“Get out in the community to talk with the
neighbors,” Thomas said. “Talk about your
events, why you’re doing them, when you’re
doing them.”

While students were encouraged to change
how they partied during O-Week, they were
not given less time in Lexington before
classes. The move-in date for Greek housing
remained the same as it has been in previous
years, two days before the start of classes.
‘”That’s something that’s been approved for
the last 15 to 20 years,” Coleman said.

To minimize tiaflic congestion, sorority

and fratemity members moved in after ﬁrst- ‘

year students had ﬁnished doing so, according
to Coleman.

Both W&L and the Police Department
emphasized that underage students themselves
choose to consume alcohol. The blame for
arrests, they said, must fall on none other than
those who break the law.

“If someone decides they’re going to
break the law, and they make that choice...

they have to understand the consequences,”
said Thomas.

Forﬁrst-year students to better understand
the consequences of underage drinking,
they heard from their peers on Residential
Life staff, the Student-Faculty Hearing
Board, Student Judicial Council and the
Executive Committee on Sept. 2 at the Student
Governance Orientation in Lee Chapel.

“Putting the EC, SJC, SFHB and RA
leadership in front of new students so early
on in their time here emphasizes the role of
student self-govemance in developing and
maintaining honor, integrity, and civility in our
campus community,” said Rodocker.

As a whole, W&L may not have a serious
drinking problem, according to Thomas. A
full 15 to 18 percent of students abstain ﬁ"om
alcohol. Last year’s O-Week controversy
arose from the actions of only 15 to 20
students, Thomas said.

To those 15 to 20 individuals and many
others, Thomas issued a challenge.

“Alcohol is very prevalent [at] Washington
and Lee University," Thomas said. “1 think
you’re better than that.”

The Colonnade buildings aren’t the only ones getting renovated in the near future. 5
