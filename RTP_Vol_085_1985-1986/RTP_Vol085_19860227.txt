Mandatory ‘stuff’

 

By PAUL DAVEY
Social Critic

 

Six months from now, you may
be sitting around your home and
all of a sudden begin thinking
about the great time you had at
Fancy Dress. Why, in early
September, might you begin
thinking about an event in the
seemingly distant past? The
answer is that the Student Ac-
tivities Board, at a price, has
many items that tend to spur
your mind to recall that eventful
night in Lexington (I mean, Rio).

What I am talking about here is
Fancy Dress_ paraphernalia.
Shirts, cups, posters, bulletins,
and perhaps other new items
bearing the official Fancy Dress
logo will be on sale next week
along with the F.D. tickets. Each
year, it seems, the total bill at the
end of the line is about twice as
high as the ticket price. Why do
people buy all of this stuff?

First of all, you must buy a T-
shirt for yourself and your date.
That is mandatory. This year,
the shirts are short-sleeved—a
change for the better, in my opin-
ion. I don’t like long sleeved T-
shirts in the first place and it
seems that many people like to
cut off the sleeves anyway for
visits to the weight room, so why
start with long sleeves in the first
place? After the two mandator-
ies are bought, people seem to
like to buy extras. Some people
just can’t decide between the hot
pink and the turquoise, so they
get both. And then perhaps shirts
are bought for those out-of-town
friends who, late in the evening
during a Christmas party said,
“Sure, I'll come up for Fancy
Dress, you can count on it,’’ but
have since reneged. Brothers
and sisters are sometimes gifted
with the shirts, perhaps to con-
vince them to come to
Washington and Lee someday or
perhaps to taunt them for going

This year’s T-shirt design

toa big, impersonal! school where
school-wide parties are impossi-
ble.

After the T-shirt stop in line,
which should be less expensive
than last year because the SAB
cut $1 off the price of each shirt,
you get to the posters. They are
usually well-designed and buying
one each year and hanging them
side by side in your apartment
does make a “decorative state-
ment” of some sort, I imagine.
They are fun to have, just so long
as you don’t get them creased up
before you get them home and
make them worthless.

Next, you hit the grain cup
department. If there is any pro-
duct on the college campuses of
America that is in utter over-
abundance, it is the grain cup.
Who do you know who does not
have stacks and stacks of these
things sitting around their room
or kitchen? And if you think
about it, you can only use one cup
at a time, disregarding parties,
so you should only need three
—one in use, one in cleaning, and

one in the cabinet. But I guess
that is a simplistic approach to
the grain cup issue. It seems that
the reason people have so many
of these big plastic cups is that
each evokes a certain memory or
place that they don’t wish to
forget. In your kitchen should be
a few cups from your hometown,
a few from the surrounding girls,
Foxfield, a couple with your
fraternity insignia on them, and
most importantly, at least one
from each year’s Fancy Dress.
So do not pass up this valuable
stop in the line.

It seems that after looking at
the situation at F.D. parapher-
nalia, there can be but one con-
clusion: Buy, buy, buy. Why not?
The stuff is fun and will last for a
long time, if not lost or lifted by a
temporary resident of Amherst
County who was not by her own
choice unable to attend the ac-
tual party. And each time you put
on the shirt or take a drink from
the F.D. cup, you will be filled
with fond memories of that great
night in Rio.

For a vintage FD...

 

By PETER HUNT
and SARAHSTEVES
Wine Critics

 

Fancy Dress is just around the
corner and it is yet again time to
consider what wines and cham-
pagnes will impress the date.
Faced with the awesome task of
matking this choice, we spent
Sunday evening at Spanky’s
—Lexington’s local cave du vin
determining the most economi-
cal and palatably rewarding
drinking experience for Fancy
Dress 1986. Let us walk you
through the weekend in a liquid
diet ranging from an inexpensive
dry white to a $60 bottle of
French champagne.

To celebrate the start of the
weekend, begin with a $5.99 bot-
tle of Freixenet, a Spanish spark-
ling wine. The froth generated by
a sparkling wine creates a happy
feeling and deliciously tingles the
palate, making this sparkling
wine ideal as an aperitif. Freix-
enet is an excellent buy because
Spanish sparkling wines are still
relatively new on the market and
American importers have kept
the price low to promote the
wines. Freixenet has an earthy
taste and is suitable for all occa-
sions — ranging from that ro-
mantic moment shared between
you and your hometown honey to

that after-the-ball party.

An inexpensive white wine
equally good for all occasions is a
1984 Virginia Riesling by Bar-
boursville Vineyards. Although it
claims to be a medium dry white,
we found it to be a moderately
sweet wine with a very young
palate and a fruity nose. It is
popular because of its charm and
drinkability — it is easy on the
palate and pocket. ($6.79 per bot-
tle.) The Virginia Riesling is an
anytime wine. It is a wonderful
way to while away a day with
some cheese and crackers or
even a light pate. One good
aspect of this wine for Fancy
Dress is that it has a lower-than-
most alcohol content. One can
drink a whole lot more and avoid
a potential headache.

The following three wines were
picked as good complements to
that special meal during the
weekend. Whether you are dining
at one of the local eateries, cook-
ing in the country, or traveling to
a resort in West Virginia, one of
these wines should most assured-
ly find a spot on your table. For
those of you with a preference for
fish or poultry, we suggest a 1984
semi-dry white table wine by
Robert Mondavi. It’s a simple,
straightforward ‘wine with a
more forceful flavor and a touch
more body than the Riesling. If
you choose this wine, try to

match it with an entree not
engulfed in a rich sauce — it will
overpower the taste buds and the
full value of the Mondavi will be
missed. The key to this wine is
not only its $9.69 price tag, but its
1.5 liter bottle.

For those hearty red meat
lovers or for those who have sav-
ed their game from hunting sea-
son for just such an occasion, an
exciting red wine is a 1983 Zin-
fandel by Sutter Home. With a
$6.59 price tag, it is a spicy wine
with an evenly peppery taste. It
has an exotic feel to it. Zinfandels
can be drunk young or left to age.
To really complement this wine,
drink it with wild boar or even a
tough fish, perhaps salmon.

Another catchy red wine, made
for meat and cheese and all but
the most delicate of fish, is the
1977 Merlot by Firestone Vine-
yards. It is a little more expen-
sive at $8.29 a bottle, but has a
very distinctive taste for a med-
ium-bottled red. It is a wine of
great drinkability and has a
luscious taste. It should be drunk
at room temperature, but if Fan-
cy Dress weekend turns out to be
warm enough, you might want to
cool it just a little. Firestone
makes an excellent wine, but the
only vineyard is_ relatively
young. Since it takes about seven
years for a vine to produce a
good grape, we feel that this

Fancy Dress Supplement, February 27, 1986, Page 3

   

By Steve Sadler/The Ring-tum Phi

The right wine can impress a date

vineyard should be coming of age
in the near future. Even so, this
1979 Merlot is very satisfying to
even the most inebriated of
palates.

Finally, we get to our last two
selections. For the big drinkers,
we suggest a 1983 Cabernet Savi-
gnon by Fetzer. With a nominal
price tag of $28.59 for three liters,
it is a medium-bodied, finely
balanced but fully varied
flavored red wine. It has a
forceful flavor with a sharp nose
and can be drunk either with a
meal or simply to lose some in-
hibition.

For the beautiful people out to
make a memorable weekend, or
just simply looking for a new
candlestick holder, we suggest a
1978 bottle of fine Perrier-Jouet
with a price tag of $53.69. The

bottle is easily distinguished
from its peers by the highly
noticeable pink and_ green
flowers painted on the label.

' Beyond this superficial beauty is

an excellent light champagne
with a distinctive bouquet. Here
lies the key to a sparkling wine
and a champagne. The bouquet
of a champagne is noticeably
more aromatic and pleasing to
the senses, as is the persisting
taste on the palate.

Thus ends our brief introduc-
tion to some of your better bets
for Fancy Dress, chosen from
Lexington’s available wines. In-
dulge yourself and we are sure
you will enjoy each and every
one. But remember, a wine is
like a woman; to be compliment-
ed, appreciated, pampered —and
never abused.

The Basie Orchestra
featured at FD Ball

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

The World Famous Count
Basie Orchestra will bring its
renowned brand of jazz to the
Fancy Dress Ball for the second
year in a row.

Led by director Thad Jones,
the Basie Orchestra may be
without its namesake but it cer-
tainly is not without its stature.
Jazz great Henry Mancini once
said of Basie and his orchestra,
“No one or no band has con-
tributed more to American
music than Count Basie.”’

William Basie, an only child,
was born Aug. 21, 1904, in Red
Bank, N.J.

Thomas ‘Fats’ Waller in-
fluenced Basie’s early style

which he honed in the Harlem
clubs of New York City in the
1920s. In later years Basie toured
the famous T.0.B.A. ‘“‘wheel,”’
the major vaudeville circuit for
black entertainers. One evening
while stranded in Kansas City,
the Count signed up with the
Walter Page Blue Devils and
soon thereafter joined the Bennie
Moten Orchestra.

When Bennie died in 1935,
Basie took over.

When talent scout John Ham-
mond heard Basie’s band, he en-
couraged Basie to add to the
band. He took them to New York
in 1935 and the Count Basie Or-
chestra began its career as one of
jazz’s all-time great outfits.

When Basie died on April 26,
1984, his obituary read: ‘Your
melodies will linger in our hearts
forever.”’

Tickets are $10 per couple and
space is limited to 25 couples.

The breakfast was the brain-
child of Alumni Director Dick
Sessoms and was organized by
freshman Valerie Pierson.

Pierson said the breakfast was
organized without the coopera-
tion of the Independent Union
because “they haven’t been able
to organize anything in the past.”

Senior Chuck Diffenderfer,
chairman of the Independent
Union, said nothing was organiz-
ed for Fancy Dress because of
“Jack of support last year.”

Tickets for the breakfast are

Real ‘Carnaval’ endures
in Rio for hundred years

 

By JOHN KALITKA
Staff Reporter

 

Of the great popular entertain-
ment available in Rio de Janeiro,
only one tradition has endured
for more than 100 years and can
still demand widespread recogni-
tion as one of the finest and most
elaborate celebrations in the
world.

Earlier this month, Rio cele-
brated its 136th “Carnaval.”
For Rio, “Carnaval’’ begins on
the Saturday preceding Ash Wed-
nesday and continues for four
days and nights of parades, balls,
and frenzied celebration. The
climax of Rio’s ‘Carnaval’
season is the contest among the
city’s various samba schools
which parade down the Avenida
Getulio Vargas in elaborate
costume and ethnic dress. For
Rio’s elite, the revelry concludes
with a spectacular Ash Wednes-

day ball in the city’s Municipal

Theatre.

“Carnaval,” as it is observed
by the traditional Roman Catho-
lic calendar, is a period of
celebration and festivity im-
mediately preceding the Lenten
Season — a religious observance

during which Catholics, at one
time, abstained from eating
meat for some 40 days. The word
“Carnaval” itself can be traced
to the Medieval Latin phrase
carnemlevare OY  carnelvarium,
which literally means “to put
aside meat.”

Although some of the sponta-
neity of earlier ‘‘Carnaval’’ cele-
brations has been lost (some
claim the samba school parade
has taken on a quasi-official
designation and_ therefore
become less impulsive), Rio’s
streets remain packed with enor-
mous and exuberant crowds that
rival any similar celebration.
Preparations for the annual
event begin weeks in advance.
Even the poorest from Rio’s
favelas join in the merrymaking.

“Carnaval’’ is celebrated
throughout the world in Roman
Cathloic countries, although the
first day of the “Carnaval”
season varies with local custom.
In Munich and Bavaria, for ex-
ample, ‘Carnaval,” or Fasch-
ing, begins on the Fesat of the
Epiphany (Jan. 6), while Cologne
and the Rhineland area of Ger-
many begin thear festivities on
Nov. 11 shortly after 11 a.m.

ute). In New Orleans, the ‘‘Car-
naval” season climaxes with the
Mardi Gras season beginning 10
days before Shrove Tuesday (the
Tuesday before Ash Wednes-
day).

Although the origin of ‘Car-
naval” is uncertain, it is believed
to have its roots in ancient
Roman and Greek agricultural
festivals which celebrated the
resurrection of nature with the
coming of spring. And while sur-
viving ‘‘Carnaval’’ customs have
succumbed to local folk tradi-
tions and exhibit great variety,
certain features of the ancient
Roman and Greek festival
themes have endured:

eAbundant display of costume,
masquerading, dancing and song
(available at the Warner Center
next Friday night).

*Rich food, drink and celebra-
tion (partially available at War-

Let’s Active and dB’s to
get FD weekend rockin’

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

 

When Let’s Active hits the stage next Thursday
night at the student activities pavilion, a great
many people are probably going to ask them-
selves, ‘‘What’s a ‘Let’s Active?’ ”

A good question, that. For starters, take a look at
the name. ‘‘Webster’s New World Dictionary”
defines ‘‘let’’ as a verb meaning ‘‘to allow; per-
mit.’’ “Active” is an adjective meaning ‘‘acting;
working.” Does that help?

I didn’t think so, Try this: Let’s Active was form-
ed in 1981 by pop genius and wonderboy Mitch
Easter. Easter has been behind the controls pro-
ducing some of the best pop albums of the last five
years (R.E.M., Pylon and Love Tractor) and Let’s
Active is his own baby.

They are from South Carolina, if that helps.

Here is some more nifty information. According
to the group’s biography, Mitch plays ‘“‘an ‘elec-
tronic’ guitar through a vacuum-tube amplifier
covered in mysterious dials and lights.’’ Sound
pretty far out? You bet. There is a bass player as
well named Faye Hunter who shares the singing
with Mitch. And they have a drummer and another
guitarist as well.

Their first release was an EP called ‘‘Afoot”

which, according to their biography, sold ‘‘in ex-
cess of 11 billion copies.” Or something close to
that, I guess. Their debut album, ‘“‘Cypress’”’ has

(again, this is according to their bio) “grooves,

black plastic, a cardboard jacket and a neato pic-

ture inner sleeve.’’ Yipes!

Perhaps this will help. Let’s Active is one of

America’s brightest new bands. ‘‘Cypress,’’ for

those who have had the pleasure of hearing it, is a

record to rejoice over. It is a sort of cross between

R.E.M.’s “Murmur” and the Beatles’ ‘‘White

Album.”’ Mitch Easter’s songs are hook-filled ear-

candy which stick in the listener’s head like a

memorable kiss. And he’s a brilliant guitarist. As | uerriero said he has heard “good reports”
the biography says, “Kinda free kinda wow.” You about Thursday night’s billing from both the Uni-

t. versity of Virginia and Hampden-Sydney College.
Opening up for Let’s Active will be North Caro- | ‘Weare trying to offer the best quality act which
lina’s dB’s (as in “‘deciBels,’). The dB’s are proba- W¢ think will offer a quality time,” he said.
bly Let’s Active’s biggest competition for Next Big Tickets for the show are $6.

Junior Walker to close out ball

Junior Walker of Junior Walk-
er and the All Stars was one of
the Motown label’s first artists.
His hit records include ‘Shot-
gun,’’ “Do the Boomerang,”
“Shake and Fingerpop,” ‘Road
Runner,” “How Sweet It Is,”
“Pucker Up Buttercup,” “What
Does It Take?” and ‘These
Eyes.”

“I’m always playing,”’ he says.
Junior Walker was born Autry
Dewalt, and came originally
from Indiana. He has spent most
of his life in Indiana and
Michigan, and now lives on a
farm near Battle Creek, Mich.
He remembers big, hard-work-
ing Sunday afternoon jam ses-
sions in South Bend, Ind. and
says that’s where he first decided
he wanted to be a musician

 

 

 

 

Mitch Easter (right) and Let’s Active

Thing, incidentally. Their first two records,
“Stands for deciBels’’ and ‘‘Repercussions,’’ were
critic favorites and were simultaneously ignored
by American listeners. After the departure of
head-dB Chris Stamey, however, the dB’s landed a
major label deal. Guitarist Peter Holsapple took
over the writing chores and served up the best
batch yet of dB classics.

SAB chairman Mike Guerriero said that the SAB
usually runs into ‘trouble signing a band for the
Thursday night concert because the SAB has one
night a year to work with.”

“It’s damn near impossible to get a band booked
for that one night,” he explained.

 

 

 

Junior Walker, minus his All Stars

it’s the one he still plays, and the
one on which the Walker sound
has grown.

In the early

he cut some R&B rockers such as
“Good Rockin,’’’ ‘‘Willie’s
Blues,” ‘““‘Brainwasher,” ‘Twist

SAB expects to clear
_ profit with ticket sales

 

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Fancy Dress is expected to
cost about $64,000 this year, but
the Student Activities Board
hopes to earn a profit of about
$1,000 from the sale of tickets, t-
shirts, cups and posters, accord-
ing to the SAB’s Rob Tolleson,
chairman of the Fancy Dress
committee.

This total is about the same as
last year’s FD budget of $65,000
but the SAB is ‘‘making every ef-
fort to stay in budget”’ and avoid
a repeat of last year’s deficit,
SAB Executive Director Mike
Guerriero said this week. To help
avoid tbe deficit, ticket prices
have been raised for the first
time in several years from $30 to
$35 per couple.

Thursday night’s concert in the
student activities pavilion, fea-
turing the band Let’s Active, will
cost another $14,000 but probably
will not bring in more than
$12,000 from beer sales and the $6
per person ticket price, Tolleson
said. The SAB will make up the
difference through the small pro-
fit from FD or from the regular
SAB budget.

About 41 percent of the FD
budget, $26,000, will pay for the
five bands and five specialty acts
scheduled to perform Fri-
day night. Uther major costs tor
the night include the bill for T-
shirts and other memorabilia,

about $51,500, or about 79 percent
of the total revenues. Income
from the sale of FD memorabilia
will bring in $15,000, or 19 per-
cent, and the remainder will
come from the sale of ads in the

Skip Castro to meld
Classics, originals

After seven and a half years
together, Skip Castro has forged
a strong reputation on the college
and club circuit from Atlanta to
Boston by combining a blistering
live show with a potent reper-
toire that melds classic rock ‘n’
roll with a blossoming collection
of catchy original songs. The
quartet is composed of guitarist
Bo Randall, pianist Dan Beirne,
bass player Charlie Pastorfield,
and drummer Rico Antonelli and
takes its name from manager
Corky Schoonover, who once us-
ed Skip Castro as a stage name.
The group originated at a weekly
jam session at the University of
Virginia where Randall and
Pastorfield went to school. The
songwriting is handled by Beirne
and Pastorfield who between
them have penned nearly three
quarters of the songs on the

tists such as the Kinks, Chuck
Berry, James Brown, Marshall
Crenshaw, Kenny Loggins,
George Thorogood, Southside
Johnny, NRBQ, Delbert McClin-
ton and the Atlanta Rhythm Sec-
tion. Furthermore, as a member
of the NACA (National Associa-
tion of Campus Activities), Skip
Castro has been nominated for
the entertainer of the year award
the last two years, and in 1983
their videotape of ‘‘Boogie at
Midnight”’ earned a spot on
MTV’s “Basement Tapes” com-
petition. Also in 1983, the band’s
New Year’s Eve show at the Wax
Museum in Washington, D.C.
was listed in Billboard maga-
zine’s top ten national grosses. In
January, Skip Castro was
selected to perform on stage for
