Presidential candidates: our impressions

The student body this year will choose
its president from among three candi-
dates who all currently serve on the Exe-
cutive Committee. That is somewhat
unusual in recent “Big Three”’ elections;
two of the last three student body
presidents, for example, had no EC ex-
perience. One advantage to having in-
cumbent EC members running for higher
office is that there’s some solid informa-
tion on which to evaluate them beyond the
usual flurry of posters, canned state-
ments and long-winded letters.

Since it’s easy to get bored and lost in
the blizzard of candidates’ comments
about coeducation and the Honor System,
we wanted to take a stab at some less
predictable insights into the individuals
asking you to hand your student govern-
ment over to them.

The Ring-tum Phi has a reporter and
two or three editors at each Monday night
EC meeting, so we get a pretty good feel
for the personalities and competence of
the committee members. Since no sane
students should be subjected to those
weekly exercises in controlled chaos, we
thought it appropriate to pass along some
of what we have observed.

Our impressions, then, of the three
presidential candidates:

Vice President Andrew Caruthers
frustrates us not so much because of what
he is but because of what he could be. He
has an extremely appealing personality ;
first impressions are his forte, and he
would excel at the numerous face-man

aspects of the job, such as meeting with
the trustees and orienting the freshmen.
A three-year veteran of the committee,
Caruthers was first elected as a freshman
and has grown more effective each year.
He has mastered the intricacies of the
Honor System and has done a more-than-
competent job this year with the thank-
less task of managing the student body
budgets. Ever conscious of his constituen-
cy, Caruthers is always among the first to
suggest that the committee seek student
opinion when a controversial issue comes
up. Unfortunately, he is also given to pet-
tiness and paranoia, characteristics that
torpedo his otherwise effective leadership
style and hint at a troubling insecurity.
Caruthers remains a likeable, talented
guy who could be the ideal president to
make the student government’s transi-
tion from the “old” to the ‘new’
Washington and Lee. He several times
has shown a willingness to stand up to the
administration and has demonstrated on
numerous occasions that he votes his
principles rather than simple political ad-
vantage. If there is such a thing as earn-
ing the presidency, Caruthers has done it:

He is easily the most dynamic and ex-
perienced of the three candidates. If
Caruthers would stop playing games and

just be himself, he — and the student body

— would be well served.

Junior representative Shayam Menon
has managed skillfully to steer clear of
two traps that lay waiting for him. One
was to become a tooth-and-nails, at-the-

throat rival of Caruthers, and the other
was to be a stooge for this year’s presi-
dent, who is a close friend, fellow dor-
mitory counselor and fraternity brother.
Caruthers and Menon would seem to have
been natural adversaries. When Caru-
thers was a freshman, he basked in the
spotlight of being the only class represen-
tative; the next year, he had Menon as a
colleague. Through efforts on both of
their parts, they have developed an
amicable relationship and have worked
well together. Although Menon generally
agrees with the president, he is not — and
is not perceived as — a John Lewis clone
or puppet. Menon followed Caruthers’
lead in staying in close touch with the
class by employing an innovative system
of specific contacts in each fraternity for
consultation on issues. He is an extremely
popular dorm counselor and has walked
the fine line between being friendly and
outgoing and yet avoiding any ap-
pearance of being a political climber.
Like most members of the committee, he
has a refreshing sense of humor, but
takes matters seriously when it’s time for
business. Menon would hardly be a
charismatic public speaker, a definite
drawback in an office as visible as the
student body president’s. He would
be a caretaker president rather than an
activist, but his thoughtful, careful ap-
proach to issues would promote level-
headedness on the committee.

Second year law representative Bill
Thompson has not distinguished himself,
but neither has he made a fool of himself,

a feat that has eluded several recent law
school representatives. Thompson’s
years as a W&L undergraduate gave him
a good understanding of the Honor
System, and he has worked well with the
committee’s undergraduates. Despite a
surprisingly short temper, he frequently
contributes constructively to committee
discussions. He, too, has escaped too
close an identification with the president,
a friend and fraternity brother, and has
voted differently from him on several
issues. On the rather narrow ideological
spectrum that comprises this year’s EC,
Thompson would be left of center. His
years as an undergraduate have given
him a memory of the institution broader
and deeper than any of the other can-
didates. Having a law student as student
body president would undoubtedly be a
huge stride in promoting greater iden-
tification between the two sides of Woods
Creek. The relationship will never be as
close and as productive as it was then the
law school was housed in Tucker Hall, but
Thompson could significantly narrow the
gap between the two student bodies of one
university.

A final note: More than half of the work
the EC performs is not reported by the
newspaper or seen by many students. To
the extent that member performance
cannot be observed in the context of honor
matters, our judgment of the candidates
is incomplete. In that sense, how this
year’s EC upheld the Honor System
or allowed it to weaken ultimately must
be the deciding factor.. .

Caruthers: Urges

 

By JIM STRADER
Editor

 

Experience in several Ex-
ecutive Committee positions and
exposure to a variety of student
government functions are the
key attributes EC Vice President
Andrew Caruthers said he would
bring to the job of student body
president.

Caruthers, 20, a junior
business administration major
from Shreveport, La. said in his
three years on the EC he has
observed not only the major
workings of the committee, but
also minor things the ‘ins and
outs’’ of the EC. His participation

Junior Executive Committee
representative Shayam Menon
says that if successful in his
quest for the EC presidency he
will try to strengthen the Honor
System and make the student
government more attentive to
students’ views and opinions.

Menon said in an interview this
week that he currently stays in
touch by use of a ‘‘network”’ of
students he created to keep tabs
on the views of fellow students.
He said that as president, he
would continue the system.

“‘T want to be open-minded next
year,”’ he said.

would give him something to fall
back on as president.

“It’s a big step to be elected to
the EC as a representative,” he
continued. ‘‘And it’s a big step to
£0 from being a rep to being on
the “Big Three’. The next step is
to capitalize on all the fortes and
foibles of the last three student
body presidents I’ve served,”
Caruthers said.

Caruthers stressed the impor-
tance of improved relations be-
tween the undergraduate cam-
pus and the law school as well as
the importance of maintaining
good relations between the stu-
dent body and other University
groups.

“Td like to strengthen the
Honor System orientation for

Uses ‘network’ to

Menon, a business administra-
tion major from Charles Town,
W.Va., is in his second year as a
class representative and also
serves as a dormitory counselor.

He lists the Honor System
among the strengths of W&L, yet
feels the process of implement-
ing it can be improved.

“You would be very idealistic
to say the Honor System works
completely,’ he said. ‘Lying,
cheating and stealing, in some
aspects, are inherent to human
nature.”

“T think we have a system
where we trust each other,”
Menon added. ‘‘There are flaws
but we have to move in a positive
direction rather than a negative
one.”’

‘laissez-faire’ toward coed

first-year law students,” he said.
“T’d like to involve W&L alumni
at the law school — the seven-
year men — in orientation.”’

Caruthers pointed out that ac-
ting as a liason from the student
body to the Board of Trustees is
among the duties of the student
body president.

“He has to articulately express
the student body opinion to the
board on all issues,’ Caruthers
said. ‘‘He is also the conduit to
the faculty. It’s very important
to be able to express student
body opinion there and explain
the opinions no matter what it
may be.”’

On the issue of coeducation and
some of the related problems
that have surfaced, Caruthers
said he thinks W&L ought to

He suggested ways of improv-
ing the system, including more
comprehensive orientation of
freshmen and new faculty mem-
bers at the beginning of the
school year.

As a weakness of the school,
Menon cited the current organi-
zation of the Student Control
Committee.

“T don’t think they’re properly
structured right now to take on
more serious cases,’’ he said, ad-
ding that there should be a more
routine way the SCC goes about
its investigations and hearings.

Menon said he had not seen
much change since he’s been at
W&L except for the dorm life
where, because of new Virginia
drinking laws, the majority of

adopt a ‘‘laissez-faire”’ attitude.

“T don’t think we should force
anything prematurely,’’ he ex-
plained. ‘‘Coeducation is a thing
that has happened and it should
be allowed to run its course. ‘I’m
against pushing things ahead of
their time.”’

Although the Honor System
has been surrounded by con-
troversy recently, Caruthers
said that has. served to
strengthen it.

“Despite the doubt about the
Honor System this year, it’s been
a positive effect,’’ Caruthers
said. “It’s encouraged students
to take an active role. It’s caused
them to strengthen their belief
and realize the importance the
Honor System has at W&L.”’

Although Menon initially voted
in favor of creating the non-vot-
ing female position on the SCC,
he said that after hearing SCC
and student body opposition to
the position, he changed his vote.

“T don’t think the placing of an
ad hoc woman [on the SCC] is the
solution to the problem,” he said.

He suggests an alternative sol-
ution, such as the greater use of
dorm counselors to assist with
testimony.

He said that if he loses the race
for president, he will not run for
senior class representative so
that ‘‘new blood’ can flow into
the committee after his two
years as a representative.

Thompson: Student-Hill relations suffering

 

 

 

WILLIAM THOMPSON

 

 

By JASON LISI
News Editor

 

Bill Thompson, a 1984 Wash-
ington and Lee graduate and the
only law student running in the
“Big Three’’ election, says he
has seen how the school has
changed since he arrived in Lex-
ington and wants to “put some-
thing back” into W&L by being
Executive Committee president.

He is presently the second-year
law representative to the EC and
is from Boca Raton, Fla.

Thompson says his main con-
cern is that the future of student
government at W&L is in danger
froin a breakdown of relations
between students and faculty.

‘If there are not improved
relations between student gov-

ernment and the faculty and the
administration, then the very in-
stitution of student government
is threatened,” he said.

“We should be working togeth-
er with these people,’’ he added.
“It’s a relationship that could be
very close.”

If these relations are not im-
proved, Thompson says, ‘‘I see
change for the worse rather than
for the better.”

He said that in his years at
W&L he has seen the academic
nature of the school improve.
“The impression that I get is that
the students are now putting
more pressure on themselves,”’
he said.

But the time-honored traits of
the campus, such as the faith in
the Honor System and the spirit

of camaraderie, have not chang-
ed, he said. ‘‘The things that
make it different from a lot of
schools still exist, and they
haven’t changed,”’ he said.

Thompson reacted to some of
the major issues on campus this
year:

eThompson said he feels that
the coeducation decision was in-
tended to make many of changes
in the University and that the
changes have been favorable.

“The obvious academic advan-
tages that the women have
brought to the campus which
have been stressed by so many
are clear, but I think that there
are other things the women can
add that haven’t even yet come

to fruition,’’ he said.
“They’re obviously interested
in participating on campus.”’

eThompson said he would be
disappointed if some minorities
whose request for a minority
non-voting ad hoc member to the
Student Control Committee voted
against some EC members in
this election.

“If the minority students took
their disfavor with our decision
out at the polls, I think that they
would be placing their energies
in the wrong direction,” he said.

“T think that it would be unfor-
tunate if they chose to take it out
on this particular committee
because the committee was only
acting in the interest of the stu-
dent body,” he said.

Junior Paul Abbott says he is offering
the student body his trustworthiness to
uphold the Honor System as a candidate
for vice president, and he believes that
students can define the Honor System and
are ultimately responsible for it.

Abbott, an East Asian Studies major
from Richmond, said this week that he
doesn’t believe in the ‘‘boys will be boys’’
argument.

“T think the IFC is there to deal with
behavior of that sort,’’ he said. ‘“‘The EC
is there to determine what’s honorable
and what’s not, and I believe that was
what Robert E. Lee’s argument was in
allowing the students to run the Honor
System.”’

“Technically, [a ‘boys will be boys”’ in-
cident] would be an honor violation, but
then again the EC does try to reflect what
the student body feels about what is hon-
orable and what is not.”’

Abbott referred to a controversial open
honor trial earlier in the year in which a

Abbott: Honor, trust to be keys to next year

student jury acquitted another student
who had been found guilty of larceny in
Lexington General District Court. “I
thought the decision wasn’t detrimental
to the Honor System because I think the
student body decides the Honor System.”’

Abbott said his administrative exper-
ience includes positions as corresponding
secretary and pledge educator for Phi
Gama Delta fraternity, jobs that give him
a vote in a body similar to the EC and
make him responsible for indoctrinating
freshmen.

He gave Vice President Andrew Caru-
thers good marks for keeping tight con-
trol of the student body budget this year
by limiting the amount of money
organizations could list under ‘‘miscel-
laneous” in their budget requests and
reports, and he praised the EC for giving
groups with larger constituencies greater
funding.

He also said he has gained budgeting
experience by handling a speaker/dinner
program for his fraternity.

The major reason that he’s running for
office, though, is to protect the Honor
System.

Abbott said he read recently about a
poll at another Virginia college with an
honor system. In the poll, 75 percent of
the students admitted to cheating.

“T don’t believe that happens here, and
I don’t wish to see it happen here,”’ Abbott
said.

“The Honor System is one of the rea-
sons I came here in the first place.”

Abbott said the reason there are so few
candidates for ‘“‘Big Three’ positions as
compared with last year may be related
to the amount of controversy the Honor
System has generated.

“Next year is going to be a key year for
the Honor System,”’ he said.

“T don’t think there’s really that many
people willing to take up this challenge.”’

“A lot of people are questioning if there
really is an Honor System.”’ The answer
to maintaining a strong system is a strong
EC, Abbott said.

He added that his contact with much of
the student body will let him keep the EC
in tune with the students.

“T feel I have a firm grasp on the feel-
ings of students.”

Surgner: W&L ‘tension’ needs to be solved

Staff Reporter

 

Junior Brandt Surgner, one of two can-
didates for vice president, feels the most
significant change at Washington and Lee
this year has been a new atmosphere fill-
ed with tension.

Surgner said this week that most of the
tension stems from differences between
the upperclassmen and the freshmen
women; or, with neither party actually to
blame.

“There are still some upperclassmen
who aren’t quite ready to accept coeduca-
tion,” he said, ‘‘and when they hear the
women complaining about the ad hoc
member and things like that, I guess that
just tends to tick them off.”’

Surgner added, though, that he has
been surprized by how receptive some of
the upperclassmen have been.

“As the year has progressed, people
have become more openminded,’’ he
said. ‘‘They just don’t want it all dumped
on them at once.”

Surgner said he is opposed to a female
ad hoc member on the Student Control
Committee. He said it is “not fair’’ to
either men or women, because such an
appointed member would only bring
about hostility and more tension.

Another area in which tension is in-
creasing, according to Surgner, is in stu-
dent attitudes toward the Honor System.
While Surgner does not see any weaken-
ing of the system, he realizes that there
are differences among the student body
over what constitues an honor offense. He
cited fake identification cards as an ex-
ample. While some students consider any
false identification to be a violation of
honor, Surgner said he feels that a viola-
tion occurs only when a student is ques-
tioned about the card’s validity.

“If a person says, ‘“That’s me,”’ that is
without a doubt an honor violation,’’ he
declared.

The various tensions between students
are making them less inclined to be
friendly, Surgner contends. People don’t
seem to speak to each other as much as
they have in the past two years,”’ he said.

Gourmet Items of All Nations _

Subs@Imported Cheeses

 

Because of this lack of communication,
Surgner says that ‘‘tension is detrimental
to the student body.”’

He said he feels his skills in relating
with people will help him deal with the
issues on both sides more effectively.

Surgner said his ‘“‘leadership qualifica-
tions” and his ‘“‘knowledge of the Honor
System’’ make him the best suited for this
position.

He has served as president and vice
president of Sigma Phi Epsilon and is
vice president of Kathekon, the student
alumni association. He said his involve-
ment with last year’s White Book Revi-
sion Committee gave him a strong
background with the Honor System.

“Since I’ve been at W&L, the Honor
System has really had an impact on how I
look at things,”’ he said. Still, he thinks he
and many other students, take some
aspects of the Honor System, such as un-
proctored exams, for granted. ‘‘I would
like to have the opportunity to help ad-
minister the Honor System and preserve
it for this generation as well as future
generations,”’ he said.

Mize: Commitment important, not experience

 

By JIM STRADER
Editor

 

Junior Roby Mize, a candidate for Ex-
ecutive Committee secretary, says serving
in that position would give him an opportuni-
ty to repay all that Washington and Lee has
given him.

Mize, a history and economics major from
Lallas, is a member of the Student Recruit-
ment Committee and the Phi Delta Theta
social fraternity, and is a two-year tennis
team letterman. He competed in the NCAA
Division III National Tennis Championships
as botha freshman anda sophomore.

“I’ve been pretty involved at school,’’
Mize, 21, said in an interview this week.

Robins: Honor remains

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
Editor

 

Rick Robins, a sophomore economics ma-
jor from Newport News, says his main
reason for running for Executive Committee
secretary is to keep the Honor System
strong.

“‘T feel that honor should be first and
foremost,”’ Robins said.

He said freshmen and first-year law
students should have the idea of Washington
and Lee honor instilled in them through
more one-on-one contact with student
leaders during orientation, and he said he
would like to see the EC investigate honor
cases more thoroughly.

Robins, Sigma Phi Epsilon’s representa-
tive to the Interfraternity Council, said his

“W&L has given me a lot, and this is one
more way to give it back to the school, by
serving on the EC.”’

This year’s campaign is Mize’s first at-
tempt at student government at W&L, but he
said he doesn’t think experience should be
requirement for office.

“It would help to have EC experience, but
past EC people have stepped in their senior
year without any problems,”’ he said.

Mize said he doesn’t see many recent
changes in the overall W&L community,
although he has seen many changes regard-
ing coeducation. One thing he has especially
noticed through his work on the Student
Recruitment Committee is an improvement
in the applicant pool.

Coeducation has had negative effects as

freshman orientation was good, but “It was a
little bit too casual.”

He said he would like to see freshmen meet
in smaller groups and have the Honor
System explained to them in greater detail.

Robins, who was a witness in an honor
case last year, said he saw some problems
from that experience with the way the EC in-
vestigates possible honor violations.

“Each case should be investigated a bit
more than in the past,’’ he said.

“The EC this year and last year has lacked
in fairness,”’ he said, adding that he couldn’t
comment on the case he was involved in.

Robins said he would like to keep the
Honor System strong, but he doesn’t think
“boys will be boys’’ incidents necessarily
should result in expulsion.

“Each case should be dealt with in-
dividually,”’ he said.

Bedsheets in campaigns

called ugly, banned by VRB

By SEAN BUGG
Staff Reporter

 

Students remembering past
“Big Three’ elections may
notice something different this
year: There aren’t the usual
sheets hanging from buildings to
advertise candidates’ cam-
paigns.

“Tt kind of makes the campus
look ugly,” said junior John
Scannapieco, co-chairman of the
Voting Regulations Board.

The rule banning bedsheets
was passed in order to clean up

In the case of Executive Com-

well, Mize said. ‘‘The school has in a sense
overcompensated” for the women, he ex-
plained. “‘They have been given a lot. The
situation can’t be perfect for them; time is
going to have to smooth out the rough
edges.”

Mize said that although some women have
said they’ve sensed hostilities from men,
“that’s because it was such a hot issue.”

He said he thinks the anti-coed sentiment
has dissipated. “It’s heard about more than
you see it,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s not that pervasive.
Coeducation is a step to the future.”’

The Honor System hasn't undergone any
changes, in Mize’s opinion. ‘‘People point to
cases sometimes, but those are individual
things,”’ Mize said. ‘‘On the whole it still
works.”

 

 

ROBY MIZE

 

 

‘first and foremost’

Robins said the ‘“‘men’s school mentality”’
hasn’t changed at W&L, even with coeduca-
tion. The school is just a ‘‘coeducational
men’s school, if that makes any sense.”’

The answer to changing that doesn’t lie in
ad hoc woman representatives to various
committees, though.

“The best way for them to have their in-
terests represented is to have them elected,”’
he said.

Robins said he was worried that ad hoc
representatives will hurt the unity of student
committees, and a strong EC particularly is
important. Students who want to be repre-
sented can always attend EC meetings, he
said.

“The EC will be receptive to student in-
put.”’

By way of leadership experience, Robins
said he started a wholesale seafood business
that netted $4,500 last summer.

VRB lists campaign, election do’s and don't’s

Following is the text of the
Voting Regulations Board’s elec-
tion rules and regulations:

The purpose of the VRB is to
maintain fair and equitable elec-
tions. Any action or event in-
fluencing voters in an unfair
manner, as well as any question
of possible violation of the stated
rules, shall be brought to the at-
tention of the VRB. The Board,
upon hearing of the matter, will
decide whether or not the can-
didate is disqualified from the
election. The decision of the VRB
may be appealed to the Execu-
tive Committee.

The Chairman shall certify the
election as being in accordance
with the set rules and regula-
tions.

A. All elections and referen-
dums shall be publicized as pro-
vided for in the Student Body
Constitution. The notice shall in-
clude: the date(s), times, pur-
pose of voting, ballot box loca-
tions, and notice of required at-
tendance by the candidates at the
“rule-setting’’ meeting, to be
conducted by the VRB.

B. All possible candidates are
required to attend the VRB
“rule-setting’’ meeting held at
least one week prior to the night
petitions are due. They must be
given a copy of the rules and

and the Executive Committee;
appoints all special student body

proval of the EC; and has
“power, subject to the approval
of the Executive Committee, to
do anything necessary to pro-
mote the best interests of the stu-
dent body.”’

eVice President: Fuifills the
duties of the president in his
absence and manages the dis-
bursements of student body
funds, subject to approval of the
KC.

eSecretary: Keeps a record of
all student body and EC meet-
ings; records proceedings and
evidence in Honor System cases;
has charge of all student body
records; keeps an up-to-date ver-
sion of the Constituion; performs

duties; and posts notices re-
quired by the Constitution or EC.

 

 

 

 

The seven “‘Big Three” candidates respond to questions in a forum Tuesday

Candidates discuss EC’s trial coverage view

 

Staff Reports

 

The Executive Committee’s
opposition to coverage of student
body honor hearings by campus
publications was questioned this
week by some “Big Three’”’ can-
didates, but the three EC
members running for president
reiterated their support for the
policy.”’

The Ring-tum Phi this fall
published facts from an “‘open
honor trial’’ with the consent of
the accused student, which one
member of the EC at the time
called ‘‘irresponsible jour-
nalism.”’

A newspaper official replied at

Pressler:

By TOWNES PRESSLER
Senior Class President

 

 

It really is a unique privilege
that we enjoy at Washington and

Lee to have a
OPINION

completely
student run
Honor Sys-
tem and student government. It
is therefore important that the
leaders of this system be the best
leaders possible.

When voting on Monday, re-
member: that the Honor System
is only as powerful as the student
generation makes it. This was
proven this year in an open trial
in which the student generation
saw drunkenness aS an excuse
for an honor violation. It is
therefore important that you
elect someone whom you feel will

an EC meeting that the proceed-
ings at open hearings don’t stay
secret anyway, that the Honor
System would be strengthened
by a thorough discussion of the
issues raised at such trials, and
that the EC ought not be the
monopoly voice on honor mat-
ters.

Here is a roundup of the can-
didates’ comments on the issue,

gathered in interviews _ this
week:
Junior Andrew Caruthers

(president): “I’m against infor-
mation about open hearings go-
ing outside the Washington and
Lee community. I wouldn’t have
any problems if the paper was
distributed strictly on the W&L

‘Vote and

represent you and the 1986-87 stu-
dent generation. The Honor Sys-
tem today is not what it was in
1960, nor will it be the same in the
year 2000, so make sure that you
elect someone who will represent
next year’s generation.

Big Three elections are on
Monday and each office should
be filled by someone who is well
respected, and is able to make
decisions and stick by those deci-
sions. The job of president is not
an enviable position: it will
always be impossible to keep the
students, the faculty and the
Board of Trustees happy at the
same time. We need someone
who will not be afraid to stand up
to any of these groups. The presi-
dent of the student body will re-
present the student generation to
the faculty and the board as well

campus, but it’s accessible to
people outside.... We are here to
protect [the accused student]
from having his name dragged
through the mud.”

Junior Shayam Menon (presi-
dent): Publications ‘‘can get the
point across with mentioning the
details. We want to keep this
within our community; we don’t
want it to get out.”

Second-year law student Wil-
liam Thompson (president): ‘‘An
active discussion of the issues in-
volved in honor triais is more
than appropriate — it’s neces-
sary.... [But] if a student is ac-
quitted, he should be accepted
back unquestionably; there
shouldn’t be a rehash of the facts

and witnesses.”

Junior Paul “Chief’’ Abbott
(vice president): ‘I think the
press has the right [to cover the
hearings] .... I wouldn’t neces-
sarily say it hurts the Honor
System.”

Junior Brandt Surgner (vice
president): “‘I am pretty much
against having newspaper cover-
age of honor trials because I am
a firm, firm believer in the con-
fidentiality of those who are ac-
cused of honor violations. When
an honor violation goes into an
open trial, the White Book
specifically states that it is only
open to the Washington and Lee
community. Since The Ring-tum
Phi goes out of the W&L commu-

nity, I don’t think it’s right to
publish the facts of honor trials
and have our honor system scrut-
inized by those not in the com-
munity.... [Facts should be] just
minor ones, nothing major.”’

Junior Roby Mize (secretary):
“It is important that students are
informed, but if people are really
interested, they'll be there at the
hearing. The problem with news-
paper coverage is the possibility
that an honor trial will turn intoa
media event. That might cause it
to lose some of its seriousness.”’

Sophomore Rick Robins (sec-
retary): ‘I think it’s something
that should be discussed in The
Phi. I don’t think the EC has
anything to hide.”’

vote wisely’ in EC elections

as make decisions on honor
cases. Choose your president
with this in mind.

The vice president will repre-
sent you in honor trials as well as
in every student organization on
campus. The vice president
keeps the budget for every stu-
dent organization and allocates
student taxes to these groups.
Make sure that whomever you
choose for vice president will be
the type of person who will be
diligent enough to keep up the
books and won't be afraid to
freeze any group’s funds at any
time.

The secretary of the EC,
although not as glorified as the
president and vice president, will
put in as much work and has to
be a conscientious worker above
all else. Every week he will have

to write up the minutes of the
meeting, have them typed, and
post them around campus. In ad-
dition, the secretary has to
record all trials and keep records
at all trials and meetings. When
you are voting, make certain that
the person you vote for will have
the time to put into all of the
duties of secretary.

The president, vice president
and secretary are and will be
very vocal figures in the W&L
community. Make sure that they
will voice your opinion, which
hopefully will also be their own,

The most important thing to
remember when voting for the
Big Three and all other represen-
tatives is that they are represen-
ting you and you control the
Honor System and student gov-
ernment. Vote and vote wisely
