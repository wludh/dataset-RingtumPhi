5 ( listen to the rumors Don't
» pay ention to the signs. Washing-

ton and Lee’s university tavern is no
longer going by the name The Cock-
» pit but is now officially known as

,, General Headquarters.

There seems to have been nothing
but confusion about the name change

since it was officially made on Aug.
22. Many students immediately be-
gan pointing fingers at the W&L ad-
ministration thinking it forced the
name change because it might seem
offensesive to W&L’s incoming coed-
ucational class.

“The administration had absolute-
ly nothing to do with the name
change,” said Jerry Darrell, director
of food Service at W&L. ‘‘The student
managers came up with the idea to

change the name as part of our ef
forts to change the image of the
tavern.”

The Cockpit had been suffering
large financial losses in the past two
years in excess of $20,000 each, Dar-
rell said. He maintained that the
name change is part of an effort to
revitalize the tavern.

“We're in serious trouble down
here and if we don’t start doing
things a little bit differently, we will

fail,’ Darrell said.

The revenue from the entertain-
ment place in the Cockpit on Wednes-
day nights has helped the tavern pro-
bably more than any other event.
Sales on a Wednesday night could
pull in over $2,000 while other week-
nights only got sales of $10 to $30.

The tavern has planned to upgrade
its menu and make itself available
Evans Dining Hall patrons. In addi-

“Rather than being the first of an era, they want

Plante, 20, noted that although graduating in
June would be ‘‘very interesting” — “I’ve never
made history before’’— she has not yet made a
definite decision.

said extra work in the latter field may cause her to

She said W&L allowed her to transfer 90 percent
of her Hollins credits, which she said was ‘‘better
than I expected.”

Plante said that before the trustees’ vote she felt
“a lot of anti-coed” sentiment, but recently she’s
been hearing ‘‘pretty much positive stuff.”’

“The guys in general are being very gentleman-

The rationale behind the change to
General Headquarters, or GHQ for
short, is that Darrell and the student
managers at the Cockpit felt that the
name should be more associated with
the University

“In Blacksburg it’s ‘Hokie’ this and

Darrell said.

Freshwomen:

H’89ers bring

coed’s debut

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Executive Editor

 

“The women are coming. The
women are coming,’’ The Associated
Press declared.

“A broken tradition,’ WSET-TV
noted.

“Among sadness, there was joy,”
WDBJ-TV observed.

Boys and girls — going to school
together.

A big, big story ... at least in the
view of the wire service, three radio
stations, three television stations and
eight newspapers that Sunday took a
break from Congress, South Africa
and Pete Rose to chronicle the arri-
val — pink lace curtains, teddy bears
and all — of Washington and Lee’s
first undergraduate freshwomen

From the reporters’ dogged,
breathless approach, you would have
thought they were covering the SALT
ITI talks

¢ A Roanoke television correspon-
dent convinced a student to take her
clothes out of a dresser drawer and
then put them back in for the
camera. (The only problem with the
unpacking motif was that the student
had arrived Saturday.)

« A writer for a certain colorful na-
tional newspaper ventured into a
women’s restroom to verify a tip that
the fixtures appropriate to male fa-

cilities had been covered with
wooden boxes. (They were.) The re-
porter later told her student guide
that she wanted ‘“‘to see the old
buildings.”’ (She was standing in
front of Lee Chapel at the time. )

e And a Roanoke radio reporter
who said she was a graduate of
Hollins College refused to believe
dormitory counselor Kathleen
Plante’s contention that she transfer-
red to W&L because of the acade-
mics. ‘“You came here for the boys,

didn’t you?”’ the broadcaster asked.

At a Lee Chapel meeting Sunday
afternoon, University President John
D. Wilson told parents that he was
“quite astounded” by press interest
in the July 1984 decision by the Board
of Trustees to admit women under-
graduates beginning this fall.

Wilson said that considering the
barrage of coverage given that vote,
he ‘“‘shouldn’t be surprised’’ by the
fascination with move-in day, but ad-
ded that he nevertheless found all the
attention a bit “‘strange.”’

“T can’t fully account for it,’’ he
continued, ‘unless the rumor I heard
this morning is true and Brooke
Shields has transferred.”

Wilson repeated the line Monday
morning for the freshmen. The par-
ents laughed; the students didn’t.

Following the president’s talk to
parents, he patiently fielded report-
ers’ queries, mentioning only in pass-
ing that he was anxious to get back to
the television coverage of the U.S.
Open tennis championship.

Student Body President John
Lewis, who took a break from his du-
ties as a dormitory counselor to intro-
duce Wilson to the parents as ‘‘Ro-
bert E. Lee’s 8th successor,’’ was
himself one of the objects of the me-
dia’s mania.

Despite the series of interviews
Lewis went through, he never made
it onto television; his girlfriend, a
Sweet Briar junior, did — identified,
of course, as a W&L freshman.

Lewis said Sunday evening that al-
though coeducation is ‘‘exciting”’ and
will add ‘‘a new dimension” to the
school, some residual ambivalence
remains among students.

He added that in some ways the
switch is ‘tragic’ and that many up-
perclassmen felt ‘‘betrayed.”’

Mack explained.

Mack acknowledged some resis-
tance by counselors to the reporting
requirement, which formerly was
confined to drugs.

“It’s posed some problems for
counselors,’’ he explained. ‘‘People
don’t see alcohol and drugs as equals.
Alcohol is more socially acceptable.”

“T drank under age in Pennsylvan-
ia,’ he continued. ‘‘Now I have to
turn them in for doing something I
did.”

While the counselors are respon-

out punishment. Instead, counselors
report drinkers to Dean of Freshmen
H. Robert Huntley.

“Bach infraction is handled dif-
ferently depending on the circum-
stances,’ Mack said. “‘Even though
counselors have no discretion, Dean
Huntley does. That’s what’s kind of
hard about it.”

The problem Mack and several
other counselors see is what one call-
ed ‘‘the friendship factor.”

‘“‘We’re supposed to be dorm coun-
selors,’’ Mack explained, ‘‘and we’re
supposed to be their friends.”’

Student found guilty of aiding triple murder

 

Staff Report

 

It seemed oddly appropriate for the summer
that Rambo took the country by storm.

A Washington and Lee student was sentenced to
four months in prison after pleading guilty to be-
ing an accessory to a May triple murder in North
Carolina.

Ian M. Perkins, a sophomore last year, was fin-
ed $3,000, put on probation for five years and sen-
tenced to six years in the North Carolina Depart-
ment of Corrections with all but four months sus-
pended

Perkins, who was charged with being an acces-
sory after the fact to three slayings in Winston-

Salem, told authorities that he aided in the killings
because he thought they were part of a Central In-
telligence Agency crackdown on narcotics traf-
ficking.

‘“‘No way — that’s really weird,’ Student Body
President John Lewis said when told in June of the
indictments against Perkins. “‘W&L men — you
find them everywhere. This is one place | wish we
hadn’t found them.”

The charges by a Forsyth County grand jury
stemmed from the May 18 murder in Winston
Salem of an 85-year-old woman, her 65-year-old
son and his 63-year-old wife.

Authorities said Perkins drove the man they
believe to have been the killer to the victims’
house and later helped him escape and dispose of
evidence relating to the crimes

If the impression of many of those who had con:
tact with Perkins in the weeks before the indict-
ments were correct, he stumbled into the bizarre
legal tangle naively and unknowingly. When the
light finally dawned, he was terrified.

Captain Ronald N. Barker, who heads the crimi
nal division of the Forsyth County Sheriff’s De-
partment, said five detectives from the depart
ment were assigned full time to the Winston-
Salem case, and several others assisted on a part-
time basis

W. Edward Hunt, who supervised the North Car
olina State Bureau of Investigation’s inquiry into
the deaths, said three agents worked fuil time on
the case, and three to five others were involved at

Some student leaders expressed
dissatisfaction this week with the
codified list of offenses that the facul-
ty passed last year for the Student
Control Committee.

Meanwhile, several faculty
members have noticed misunder-
standing among students over a
clause regarding sexual slurs in Stu-
dent Control's list of offenses.

Second-year law student Jim Crut-
chfield, an Executive Committee
member last year, said there is the
possibility of Student Control’s
jurisdiction overlapping the E.C.’s.

“| think it has to be clear that Stu-
dent Control is subordinate to the
E.C.,”’ Crutchfield said.

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela Simpson, meanwhile, ex-
pressed concern that some students
think the new list of offenses means
that an accidental sexual slur could

result in expulsion from the Universi-
ty

Simpson said today that — as in the
past — any incident of sexual, racial
or religious slurs should be brought

informally to a dean, to be worked
out outside a judicial body

No panacea?

‘They said it couldn’t be done...’’

_ Twoyears ago, on a dreary September morning, Washing-
ton and Lee held a press conference to announce the selection
of a new president for the University. President Robert E.R.
Huntley was returning to teach law, and the provost from the
school down the road (as in ‘‘All dirt roads lead to Tech’’)
grinned as his name was formally announced as the chosen
among many.

Alumni, students and some vociferous faculty will say that
was the beginning of the end. John D. Wilson meant business
and business for John D. Wilson meant coeducation. But it
will never happen, they said with much confidence. He who
laughs first laughs last.

But it isn’t that John Wilson came in with an agenda to
change, change, change. Sure, some members of the Board
of Trustees thought women would enhance the University.
One member thought it was such a grand idea that when he
was Chancellor of the other University in Virginia he brought
women onto its hallowed lawns. They prospered there. They
could prosper here. Maybe even some trustees who could
place money where it mattered — namely in the University’s
endowment — had some leverage.

Sinister plots there may have been. Student opinion may
not have mattered. Tradition — that nemesis of the feminist
movement — had to go. It was no longer a viable defense.
Fewer college-age men were interested in the all-male
education. Even fewer of those interested in such an educa-
tion were of the caliber the University was accustomed to.
Faculty members spoke of ‘‘burn-out’’ over having to teach
nattering nabobs called freshmen the rudimentaries of an
education.

So, after the much heralded — and timely (it was Bastille
Day) — decision of July 14, 1984, to allow the entrance of
women into the undergraduate ranks, optimism ran ram-
pant, as if sowed by none other than the gipper himself. Hap-
py days were here again, we heard. More people were inter-
ested in the Colonnade and its education. More people would
consider us along with the coveted ‘“‘Ivies.’’ More, more,
more; that meant success. Coeducation had solved all our il-
ls.

Wrong.

Coeducation has solved nothing yet. Sure, the admissions
office loves having a broader target audience. That makes
the job easier (except when there are 2,800 applications to
review). Faculty, in their lofty moments of liberal idealism,
speak of the gender gap disappearing, of ‘‘reality’”’ returning
to the educational process, of “‘better classes’”’ and more en-
thusiastic students. Oh happy day!

But coeducation has solved nothing yet. Classes have not
yet started. Not everyone has returned to school. Many are
still trying to ‘‘size up’ the new class. The faculty might be as
disheartened by this year’s entering class as it was in the
past two years. Student apathy might be as great a challenge
as it has proven in the past.

One person concerned about the new turn of events at the
University tried to tell me that coeducation was just the
‘‘New Deal’ for the ’80s, the ‘“New Coke’’ of the universities,
the ‘‘we-can-solve-all-your-problems-with-one-easy-answer”’
solution for a weak patient. But history has taught us that ob-
vious answers often obviously miss the mark. The New Deal
for American history never panned out, many will note, until
World War II helped it along. It was more of a psychological
victory than an economic landmark. Will coeducation spell
the same disastrous end for the University?

That question really doesn’t matter anymore. It was decid-
ed last summer that it would not hurt us. What matters today
— as will matter throughout the school year — is that coed-
ucation is now a reality here. The changes it will spell and the
victories and defeats it will encounter can only change the
University. Whether that change is for the better or for the
worse, time will only tell. We can only hope that the new
Washington and Lee remains the classic it always has been.

The Ring-tum what?

Say “the college newspaper’”’ these days, and folks expect a
bunch of little Sam Donaldsons running around asking obnox-
ious questions. Or maybe they think of a ragsheet that con-
tinually berates oppressive governments of the world while
tearing down the guys in Washington at the same time. Or
maybe it conjures images of hermits crammed into dark lit-
tle _ wondering why no one has brought by ads for the
week.

But that’s not The Ring-tum Phi. (By the way, the name is
derived from an ancient football cheer muttered for the last
time long before our parents were ever conceived. )

We are the weekly student newspaper — we have no faculty
advisor — that brings you the latest on the happenings on
campus and around the world (incidentally, the two are not
one in the same), along with the latest in sports information,
weather, movie reviews, and advertising. It’s all here
—every Thursday — in the one and only (face it, no one else
would call their paper this) The Ring-tum Phi. ‘‘All the news
we see from the office.”’

Chauvinism

may become
last tradition

 

MY VIEW
By Brandt Surgner

 

Washington and Lee is widely
known as one of the last major
strongholds of male chauvinism, and
many are wondering if coeducation
will decrease or increase (if that’s
possible) that attitude.

Some think these feelings of male
superiority are natural, since W&L is
a ‘‘Southern school” and these atti-
tudes are widely bred in the South.
That explanation suffers only from
the fact that you hear the same chau-
vinistic remarks from men from the
North that you do from those from
the South.

How, then, does the chauvinism
arise? A couple of us were discussing
that in the Palm’s the other night and
one person (not from the South) said
he’d come to W&L without any trace
of chauvinism whatsoever, but that
after spending four years here, he
freely admits (as do most W&L men)
to being a male chauvinist.

When asked what had changed his
attitude, he took only a few minutes
to answer boldly and unashamedly:
“The women around here are, in
fact, inferior. They belong barefoot
and pregnant in the kitchen.”

The women in the class of 1989
seem to refute the lie to that opinion,
which clearly is held by more one
person. Indeed, the same person said
the freshmen women are ‘‘a hell of a
lot smarter than many men at
W&L.”’ With that being the case, it
seems as though men at W&L may
realize these women are their equals
(at least), and that may cause chau-
vinism on the Colonnade to decline
and finally die away.

That may not be the case though,
if the women continually receive
“special treatment’ — changing the
menus at the Co-op, for example, or
altering the name of the Cockpit.
“Special treatment”’ could also entail
a constant fawning over the newly ar-
rived women, which in turn could re-
sult in a neglect of the W&L gentle-
man.

Such favoritism may actually
cause the W&L man to become some-
what jealous, or resentful of women,
since he may feel threatened by
them.

If such a feeling were to arise
among the men at W&L, that could
cause the chauvinism quotient to rise
still higher among W&L men.

This would mean that the W&L
practice of going down the road to
“abuse chicks’’ may not be neces-
sary at all since it can now be done
right here at W&L.

Sigma Phi Epsilon).

| Coed non-story

 

 

is over ... finally

By MIKE ALLEN
Executive Editor

 

The biggest non-story since new
Coke now is behind us.

The other day one alumnus jok-
ingly congratulated a student on

the school’s new “bisexual”
status.
At least he was laughing about it

— the good humor hasn’t always
been unanimous. As the campus
controversy heated up two years
ago, one side compared single sex
to apartheid; the opposition liken-
ed coeducation to a rape of the in-
stitution’s traditions.

. Explaining the debate to some-
one unfamiliar with W&L invar-
iably ended in frustration. Once
while talking to a University of
Charlottesville student who
couldn’t fathom there being two
sides to the debate, I finally
resorted to: “The earth is flat — I
promise.”

 

It was at times like that that the
coed flap stopped being silly and
started being embarrassing. ‘‘All
right,” a Richmond journalist
once said disgustedly. ‘What are
those [anatomical reference de-
leted] at W&L doing now?”

Now that the tempest is over
and we ended up making the same
decision nearly every school in
the country made years before,
the inclination is to write off the
whole incident as an unfortunate,
unpleasant dream. ‘‘Coed debate?
What debate?” we’re tempted to
ask outsiders. ‘‘We’ve always had
girls here.”

* We're not answerable, though,

to those who would mock our
devotion to the school’s heritage.
Instead, our responsibility is to
the generations of Washington
and Lee men who've left the
school briefly, fleetingly in our
trust.

The night of the Board of Trus-
tees’ decision in July, 1984, I walk-
ed along the Colonnade with a

}

friend who'd been intensely, emo-

tionally involved in the ‘‘no-go-co”’
movement.

Looking down at Lee Chapel, he
began crying — crying for a
school he dearly loved, and crying
for an argument he had lost.

I'll always remember those
tears, and we all must remember
the issue that such a short time
ago polarized our campus. The
coed uproar was nothing of which
to be ashamed. It forced those
seeking change to defend their
position to an outraged alumni
and a student body screaming for
blood. ‘“‘But Mom, all the other
schools are doing it’’ didn’t cut it
—and we must never allow it to

The challenge for the university
is to remain flexible enough to
progress, but not merely to suc-
cumb to the passing fads of socie-
ty and academia.

If the coed spat fades but the
lessons from it live on, then we all
won.

 

 

Remembering a friend...

Jay Wingert, a 1985 graduate of Washington and Lee, was
killed last month in a Dallas automobile accident. Joe Cadle,
a classmate of his, sent this letter to University President
John D. Wilson. It is reprinted here with the permission of
Cadle and Wilson.

Dear President Wilson,

I am not often motivated and driven enough to write
personal letters, particularly to people that I do not
know very well. This is a special case, though, and I
would appreciate your attention to this letter.

As you may know, James R. Wingert III, class of ’85,
was killed last.week in an automobile accident. I do not
know how well you knew Jay, or even if you knew him at
all. The point is, I did know him. I roomed with him for
three years at W&L, and I loved him. I would like you to
know about him, too.

First, I want you to know what Jay was not. He was not
student body president, a member of the Executive
Committee, or a captain of any athletic club. Though
bright and sharp-minded, Jay’s grades didn’t make him
Phi Beta Kappa or class valedictorian. Simply put, Jay
might have been what some people call the typical W&L
student.

If Jay were the ‘‘typical student,’’ then W&L is a very
special place indeed. In our four years of school. I watch-
ed Jay’s character developed into something intangibly
identified with the ‘Washington and Lee gentleman.”
This concept of a “W&L gentleman,” a phrase often
scorned and ridiculed, took a very real form in the per-
son of Jay Wingert. Jay had a deep respect for responsi-
bility: responsibility to friends, studies, strangers, the
University, the country, his religious beliefs and to his
post-college job. Honor was a word that Jay aever, ever,
took lightly, and his deep caring for others was
something he never bothered to hide.

Jay was fortunate to attend a University that fostered
his ideas of honor and integrity. W&L solidified Jay’s
character into someone who I could deeply trust and re-
spect. I feel that Washington and Lee University had a
very powerful part in making the kind of person Jay
was. When Jay left the University last June on gradua-
tion day, he shed tears for the place and people that had
been so special to him.

President Wilson, I will always remember Jay. And

this year, as you approach the entering class, I want you
to remember him, too. Your task, as I see it, is to take
these young people and make them into ‘‘Washington
and Lee people,’’ the kind of person Jay was.
It is a great task, indeed.
Sincerely,

\ions Board, which is made up of the
4ditors and business managers of the
“tudent publications. He ran unop-
fosed after having worked on the
cearbook staff for three years, but
‘he Publications Board refused to ap-
prove his application until it was
assured that Sprunt would have
enough help to get the job finished.
, The Publications Board decided to
, elect two editors — Sprunt and then-
| #§unior John Buchanan, who has since
graduated. Sprunt, admitting that he

 

DAVID SPRUNT
Editor of the yearbook

really didn’t want to work with
another editor, says Buchanan quit
working on the yearbook after a cou-
ple of weeks.

‘He came in here a couple of
times,”’ Sprunt said, adding that he
didn’t think having two working edi-
tors would have gotten the Calyx out
on time.

The Calyx switched to publication
in the fall to include spring sports like
lacrosse, Sprunt said. The cost of
having to send yearbooks to grad-

uated seniors will be offset by the
reduced publishing rates available in
the fail.

“It’s a good system, coming out in
the fall,” he said.

Sprunt said it was mid-July when
he realized that the yearbook would
be late.

“Apparently I didn’t work as hard
as I should have,” he said.

Sprunt added that the yearbook
probably will end up over budget be-
cause of the extra coverage, but not
because of the late publication.

“But this will be the best Calyx
we've seen, ever,” he said.

The cost overrun, which Sprunt es-
timated at between $500 and $1,000,
probably will be borne by the Publi-
cations Board, Sprunt said. It will not
affect students who are receiving the
books, because the books were paid
for through the student tax, which
each student paid along with his tui-
tion.

The cost of producing the books
will be about $41,000, according to
Sprunt. Student taxes paid for $11,500
of that, and donations and advertise-
ments paid for the rest. Students paid
$8.50 each for the book,

The books will-be- distributed from
the Calyx office in the student center
when they are ready, Freshmen are
not entitled to one; members of the
Class of 1985 will receive theirs

Freshman interests are interesting

| By COTTON PURYEAR
Editor

 

» We’ve all heard about the impres-
sive academic statistics of this year’s
incoming freshman class, but per-
paps we can learn even more about
the class of 1989 by not just looking at
® lass ranks and SAT scores but by
, -@ooking at what they wrote about
/ themselves in their freshman face-
| kK.
|. The freshman facebook contains
ictures of most of the members of
this year’s new class, along with in-
formation on hometown and high
gchool. There is also included what
the freshman picked as their two
Ynost favorite activities. These ac-
tivities ranged from sports and out-

 

academics.

Taking a close look at the young
men in this year’s freshman class,
you can see that they are an athletic
bunch. Basketball, football, baseball
and skiing were the activities most
listed, Sports like racquetball, soccer
and golf weren’t far behind.

There were about 30 to 35 freshman
that listed those sports as among
their top interests, which is probably
good news to the W&L Athletic de-
partment. But all you College Repub-
licans and Young Democrats don’t
despair — 23 students expressed in-
terest in politics and 12 in student
government.

The top interest among the young
women in the freshman class is peo-
ple. Now ‘‘People’’ sort of seems like
a wide area to cover and you could

ways. Perhaps their interests are in
meeting people, but then their in-
terests could also be in dissecting
people. I guess it probably means
that they just prefer the company of
people to that of toaster ovens.

‘But don’t think that an interest in
people is gender-specific. While there
were 18 women who were ‘‘people’’
people, 15 men lives listed ‘‘people’’
as an interest.

Some other listings that might be of
interest are the six young women
that listed cheerleading as one of
their top activities. This might mean
that a Generals cheerleading squad
is not far away.

Among the other more interesting

interests were two surfers, five scuba
divers, four chess players, an

In an April preliminary hearing,
Girard and his attorney maintained
that because Girard never had actual
possession of the package containing
cocaine, and that it was not address-
ed to him, he could not be convicted
Testimony from law enforcement of
ficers corroborated that Girard
never touched the package.

Girard was tried before a jury on
June 11. The jury first reported itself
deadlocked after approximately two
hours of deliberations, according toa
memorandum ruling written by
Judge George E. Honts III. Honts

then instructed the jury on the
charges against Girard and they re
turned to their deliberations. Half an
hour later, the memo continued, the
jury returned a verdict of ‘‘guilty’’ on
a charge of possession of cocaine and
recommended a sentence of ‘‘not less
than five years”’ in prison for Girard
The charge Girard was being tried on
was possession of cocaine with intent
to distribute

Honts refused to accept the jury’s
verdict and re-instructed them. The
jury reported twice within an hour,
the memo said, but could reach no
verdict. In all, Honts’ memo contin

A mistrial was declared, Honts’
memo said, over Read’s objections,
and the jury was discharged. Honts
wrote that the mistrial was declared
to protect Girard’s interests and ‘‘to
avoid an improperly arrived upon
verdict.’’ A motion by Read for a new
trial was granted at that time and it
was scheduled for August

4. The local prosecutor last month faced a four-day

hearing by a Virginia State Bar committee investigat-
ing allegations of misconduct against him.

Lexington and Rockbridge Commonwealth’s Attor-
ney Beverly C. ‘‘John’”’ Read was accused of a variety
of improprieties in a report prepared earlier this year

“by a committee of the Rockbridge County-Buena Vista

Bar Association.

~~ The hearing at Mary Baldwin College was closed to
the public. The committee may decide to take no action
and make no announcement, or impose sanctions rang-
tg from a private reprimand to disbarment.

Trial dates set for students

“=F our Washington and Lee students arrested during the
last school year were assigned court dates and another's
case was placed under advisement this summer.

The case of David L. Perdue, last year’s Interfraterni-
ty Council president, was placed under advisement until
June 1986.

Perdue was arrested last May. According to the arrest

report, Lexington police Officer G.P. Joines found a

Zola was arrested in May and charged with the theft of

a $160 tub of wine from Spanky’s restaurant.

Sophomore David J. Cox, from Potomac, Md., and jun-
ior Timothy D. Walker of Williamsville, N.Y., were also
scheduled to appear in General District Court. Cox is
scheduled for Oct. 1, while Walker will appear Nov. 12.

The two were arrested in March at the Delta Tau Delta
house, according to police.

Junior charged with arson

Alex Benedetto, a junior and a member of Pi Kappa
Alpha, has been charged with felony arson in relation to
an incident at his fraternity house, according to Lex-
ington court records.

Benedetto, of New York, was arrested June 8 by Lex-
ington police Sgt. E.W. Straub. Benedetto’s preliminary
hearing in General District Court is set for Oct. 1

He is free on bond until that date, according to Clerk
of Court Juanita Rice.

Two students die over summer

Two Washington and Lee students — Jay Wingert and
Paul Knight — died in accidents this summer.

Knight, who would have been a senior this year, died
in June after a climbing accident at Yellowstone Na-
tional Park.

Knight, from Warren, N.J., was a sociology and an-
thropology major and a member of the Outing Club and

 

Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.

Wingert, who graduated in June, died Aug. 25, in an
automobile accident in Dallas, where he was employed
by the accounting firm Arthur Andersen & Co

W&L gets 18 new faculty

Sydney Marthinson, a junior trans-
fer student from Sweet Briar College
who is a counselor, echoed Mack’s
thoughts.

‘I don’t want to catch them drink-
ing,’’ she said. ‘How am I supposed
to be friends with them if they think
of me as a policeman?’

Marthinson said she found it ironic
that trust between students and their
dorm couselors was discussed exten-
sively in meetings and now the coun-
selors are expected to report the
freshmen indiscriminately for drink-
ing.

“‘How can they come to me with a
problem if they have to keep their
doors closed when I walk down the
hall?” she said.

Marthinson explained that as a
transfer from Sweet Briar, where a
different policy is in effect, she might
find it more difficult to accept the
new rules at W&L. Sweet Briar’s
policy, she said, allowed student
drinking in rooms with the doors clos-
ed.

She added that non-uniform en-
forcement of the rules might cause
problems. ‘We have to be consistent
about this. If one of the dorm coun-
selors isn’t consistent, then we come
off being the bad guy.”

Enforcement of the drinking policy
rests with Huntley and the Student
Control Committee, said dormitory
counselor John Lewis, who is also
president of the Executive Commit-
tee. Lewis added that the EC will not
be involved in alcohol policy viola-
tions.

“It’s not deemed dishonorable to
drink,’’ Lewis said. ‘‘There’s a move
afoot to make using a fake ID (for the
purchase of alcohol) an honor viola-
tion.”’

A major part of student social life
— fraternities — also will be affected
by the change in the drinking age.
The new drinking age means these
groups must also be more careful
about who is served alcohol, said In-
terfraternity Council President
Jaimie Hayne.

“We'll all just have to be a lot more
careful than we were last year,”
Hayne said. ‘‘The best thing to do is
to start carding at the door.”’

Hayne said underage drinking at
fraternity parties is not confined to
W&L and area women’s college stu-
dents. There is also a number of local
high school students who frequent
fraternity parties.

Besides checking for age identifi-
cation, Hayne said, fraternities
should be careful not to attract police
or ABC attention to their parties.

“It’s very important for fraterni-
ties to be careful about people drink-
ing in the front yards. It’s very im-
portant for fraternities to keep peo-
ple inside, so the police don’t have a

reason to stop. If they think they see
a minor, they can stop and check.”’

Hayne said he is optimistic about
fraternity cooperation.

“If everybody makes an effort, I
think we can keep minors from drink-
ing. I believe that the ABC will warn
us if we’re doing something wrong.
Until that happens, I think the best
thing to dois to card for college IDs.”’

Another hub of Lexington social
life — local bars — is affected by the
new drinking regulations.

David Sorrels, manager of
Spanky’s restaurant in Lexington,
says 75 percent of his business is done
with students. Most of these students,
he said, drink. He has not yet noticed
a drop in business from the students
that are in Lexington already.

“‘My alcohol sales are the same,”’
Sorrels said. “I haven’t seen any
decrease.”’

The policy at Spanky’s, Sorrels
said, is to check customers for age
identification when they order
alcohol. He said Spanky’s requires a
picture identification card.

“It’s a little bit simpler now with
the change of the age,”’ he said.

Some students have tried to buy
alcohol at Spanky’s without age iden-
tification by citing their school’s
honor system.

“Honor codes don’t work with busi-
ness,’ Sorrels said. ‘I’ve had many
people quote me W&L and VMI honor
codes,” he continued, but adding that
because he bears the legal respon-
sibility of enforcing the drinking age
in his restaurant, he must insist on
checking his customers for legal
identification.

‘We are going to card as closely as
possible,”’ Sorrels said.

Bob Campbell, manager of The
Palms, said the first move made at
his restaurant was to hire a doorman.
Campbell said that in the past the
policy was to check identification at
the tables.

Over the summer, Campbell said,
he met with his business partners,
and they changed the policy.

“We decided to take the burden off
of the waitress and give it to the door-
man. The waitress is making two dol-
lars an hour and we couldn’t make
her bear the responsibility of losing
the ABC license too.”’

In addition to the technical pro-
blems that the change in the drinking
age has given him, Campbell sees
other difficulties. He used as an ex-
ample a situation that he saw occur
on a recent evening.

“Three students came into the bar.
One was old enough to drink and the
other two weren’t. When we carded
them, the one who was old enough
bought three six-packs to go. If they
had stayed here, we’d have had some
control. They wouldn’t have been out
driving around in a car, or at an
apartment or a fraternity house. If
they had stayed here, I don’t think
they’d have drunk 18 beers.”

Campbell places the blame for this
type of problem on the state legisla-
ture, adding that he feels there was
pressure from national groups to
raise the drinking age.

that we'll become just another small
liberal arts college in Virginia,”
Lewis said. “I was asked three or
four times today if I'd have come
here three years ago if the school was
coeducational and I said, ‘Hell no. No

way.’ ’

Associate Dean of Students Anne
C.P. Schroer said the attention heap-
ed on the 107 freshmen women was
not completely inappropriate, ex-
plaining that there’s a certain ‘‘pio-
neer spirit’’ among them.

Preparations for C-Day made the
1984 Summer Olympics look spontan-
eous. The gymnasium was reno-
vated, the security staff was beefed
up and uniformed, and $50,000 in ad-
ditional lighting was installed.

Seven dormitory halls were con-

verted for the women’s use. Changes
include locking hall doors that have a
remarkable tendency to prop them
selves open

The feminization of Lexington ex-
tends even beyond the campus. A
counter clerk at the Arby’s on Main
Street bragged that ‘‘we’re the only
fast-food restaurant in town with two
women managers," and the 244-
year old Lexington Presbyterian
Church this summer hired a female
assistant minister.

CINCINNATI — He belongs to
baseball eternity now, to every dirt-
smudged kid on every sandlot who’s
every played this fascinating game
that is so uniquely American.

He is Pete Rose, as uncomplicated
as a punch in the nose, and he hap-
pens to have more hits than anybody
who ever walked up to home plate
with a bat in his hands.

How’s that for uncomplicated?

Using a formula he has employed
before, Pete Edward Rose charged
into history last night, crossing into
territory that was uncharted before
and probably never will be tread
again.

His record-breaking hit, on a 2-1
pitch off San Diego right-hander Eric
Show, was the quintessential Pete
Rose single, a line drive to left field,
never in doubt from the moment it
left his black bat.

If the face-first, belly-whopper
slide is Rose’s baseline trademark,
then the line-drive single is his
signature as a hitter.

So when he became baseball’s all-
time base hit king, eclipsing Ty Cobb
on the 57th anniversary of Cobb’s last
major league swing, it was entirely
appropriate that Rose did it with

-what baseball players call a frozen
rope.

This was no Astroturf bouncer.
There would be no controversial

~ scorer’s decision over whether it was

a hit or error. There would be no
close umpire’s call at first base.
Rose, as usual, took care of all

those contingencies with a first in-',

ning line drive, drilled over the short-

- ~stop’s head into left field.

‘

¥

PSs

It was his 4,192nd hit, and his
=3,162nd single. So Rose knew how to
react. He dashed hard down the first
base line as the capacity Riverfront
Stadium crowd erupted in a frenzy

.

e rarely heard in these parts since the

--glory days of the Big Red Machine.

He would add a triple later for hit
number 4,193 and he would score both
of his teams runs in a 2-0 vic-

 

  

# tory over San Diego. But this night

* would be remembered for Pete

toepRose’s trademark — a line-drive

/,osingle, the single that broke the

record.

fielded the ball on one bounce, Rose
rounded first base and took a couple
of challenging steps toward second,
much the way he had done more than
3,000 times before. That, too, was vin-
tage Rose — forcing the issue, taking
nothing for granted.

Martinez laughed about it later,
saying he was mad because Rose
made him throw to second instead of
allowing him to run the landmark
ball back for personal delivery to its
owner,

But it was typical Rose. First, you
play the game and play it hard. We’ll
celebrate later.

He retreated to first with one clap
of his hands and a double palm slap
for Coach Tommy Helms. Overhead,

fireworks exploded. In a moment, he
was engulfed by people, looking like
somebody stuck in the New York sub-
way at rush hour, The first person to
get there was Rose’s 15-year-old son,
Pete Jr., who hugged his father
warmly.

Then the rest of the Reds arrived,
swarming over this remarkable 44-
year-old man who learned from his
father that he could hone ordinary
skills to record-smashing levels with
pride and dedication.

Tony Perez and Dave Concepcion,
his longtime teammates, hoisted
Rose on their shoulders and let the
adulation of 47,237 fans rain down on

a part of history, watched as he sat
atop the pitcher’s mound.

“I’m not smart enough to have the
words to describe my feeling,’’ Rose
said. ‘‘I didn’t know what to do.”’

“T was doing all right, then I sort of
looked up and started to think about
my father. I saw him up there, and
right behind him was Ty Cobb.”

That was when the tears came,
tears that relieved the tension and
emotion of the moment, tears that
sent Rose over to lean on Helms’
shoulder and brought Pete Jr. back
on the field to support his father.

CINCINNATI — The hit was exact-
ly that and much more.

When Pete Rose lined a single to
left-center field in his first at-bat
last night, his 23-year chase of
Ty Cobb’s once seemingly invinci-
ble record officially ended. Hit
number 4,192 made Rose the number
one hitman in baseball history, and

, produced an evening filled with both

euphoria and emptiness.

Fawn Rose, who has been intently
watching her father’s exploits, was
both delighted and somewhat somber
after the momentous occasion.

“Tt was a wonderful feeling to know
my father achieved the record he has
strived for all his life. I got chills and

I cried,” said the 20-year-old pre-med
student last night at Franklin College
in Columbus.

“It’s sort of a big letdown too, now
that it’s over, she added.

But the rest of the Rose contingent
was delighted, and exhausted.

“I’m just so happy,’’ said La Verne
Noeth, his mother. ‘‘He was crying.
He doesn’t show it, but he can be an
emotional person.”’

“We're very happy, it’s just won-
derful,” said wife Carol Rose with
her young son Tyler in a baby
walker.

“T just love him. It’s wonderful,”’
said Dave Rose, Pete’s younger
brother, tears streaming down his
cheeks.

RUSH

All-male Rush still
will involve women

 

 

By JASON LISI
Staff Reporter

 

Although most of the University’s
attention has been on the newly ar-
rived women, next week it will shift
to the men when the two-week frater-
nity Rush beings. No fraternities
allow women as members and there
are no sororities at Washington and
Lee.

The freshman women, though, will
be able to take part in certain Rush
activities.

An Interfraternity Council rule
says W&L women will be permitted
at all Rush functions except open
houses. They may sign up for and go
to rush dates just as the men do, but
are not reviewed for possible frater-
nity membership. ‘

Associate Dean of Students
Pamela Simpson said yesterday the
IFC and the Coeducation Steering
Committee, in permitting the women
to go through Rush, ‘‘tried very hard
to make sure that women had a role
in Rush.”

“We have always encouraged men
who were not going to join a fraterni-
ty to go through Rush as a way of
meeting people,’ Simpson said.

‘Even though the women won’t be
able to join fraternities, they can still
benefit from Rush, she added.

“We have to make sure that
everyone feels like they're part of the
community,” she said.

When asked why the women were
allowed to go to Rush dates but not
open houses, IFC President Jaimie
Hayne said: ‘‘Rush is for the guys.
We need some time to be alone — one
on one — with the guys.”

Another IFC rule is that women
from other schools will not be allow-
ed to participate in formal Rush func-
tions. Hayne said the IFC continued
the rule from past years.

“It would get too complicated to
organize that many girls, both from
the girls’ schools and W&L,”’ Hayne
said.

He added, though, that he’d ‘‘really
like to see sororities developed in the
next five or six years.”’

In meetings last year, the Coeduca-
tion Steering Committee agreed to a
two-year moratorium on so-called
“little sister’ programs, in which a
woman could be an unofficial mem-
ber of a fraternity while enjoying the
benefits of being an official member.

After extensive review of little sis-
ter programs at other colleges, the
committee decided there would be
too few women for the number of
fraternities and that type of program

would hinder the ‘‘natural develop-
ment of the social structure.”’

“Extensive affiliation might
hinder the formulation of other
organizations and, at a time when
class unity is important, these pro-
grams might prove divisive,” the
committee’s report said.

Little sister programs are banned
until the fall of 1987, when the pro-
gram will be reviewed again.

The Coeducation Committee also
investigated the ideas of sororities at
W&L. So far, 10 sororities have ex-
pressed interest in the University.

“If interest is shown in sororities,
then the University is obliged to show
the same support for sororities that it
has shown for fraternities,’’ accord-
ing to the report.

“Freshmen women will have to use
their own initiative to bring sororities
onto campus,”’ Simpson said.

When enough women — 25 to 30, ac-
cording to the report — have shown
interest, the coeducation committee
will go on to help the formation of the
sorority.

The committee will form a group to
advise the interested women. This
group will be composed of adminis-
trators, faculty and students who will
review the various national sororities
and their structures.

Associate Dean of Students Dan
Murphy, a member of the Coeduca-
tion Committee, said it would “aid
the interests of the women if the in-
terest is expressed.”’

Hollins party upholds tradition

 

By PAUL DAVEY
Staff Reporter

As day broke over the Hollins College apartments, the

strewn cups, cans and other assorted items pointed to
one event: the annual first-week-of-school apartments
party.
That ‘‘The Party” had indeed occurred was confirmed
by the higher than usual number of groggy-looking W&L
men knocking on doors looking for rides back to Lex-
ington.

The Party has become somewhat of a sacred ritual,
especially for Hollins girls who look forward to a night
without the usual competition from the other women’s
colleges. As in years past, the street between the second
and third rows of apartments was a literal sea of people.
Some come to meet “everyone,” some come to get some
rushing in during ‘‘no contact’’ period, some come to get
a first taste of a big collegiate party, and some come be-
cause the noise prevents them from sleeping.

In all, about half a dozen fraternities from W&L set up
shop for the night in the apartments. Altbough the apart-

ments used as “headquarters”’ are invariably trashed,
the girls don’t seem to mind. Apparently, it is a small
price to pay to have a big group of eager W&L men
stumbling around one’s porch pulling beers from a cold
box.

A new aspect of this year’s party was the presence of
W&L girls. From all accounts, there was no hissing from
Hollins girls. Hopefully peace and coexistence will con-
tinue. There should be no reason why the girls from W&L
should be junwelcome down the road. But, no, girls, it
probably would not be wise to bring masses of guys to
Graham-Lees from that public, state school north of
here, or from that other institution whose name I cannot
immediately recall.

So, the long-awaited apartment’s party has now come
and gone. It was a success, a time for anyone to achieve
whatever he or she would like to have acmeved. Hopeful-
ly, on future September mornings, the streets of the
aparfments will again be decked with cups and cans and
young Hollins freshmen will happily wake up to see their
Gucci shoes covered in party gravy. For if these things
happen, we will know that the tradition continues.

Interfraternity Council President
, Jaimie Hayne says no decision has
* been made regarding charges that
‘Sigma Nu fraternity broke Rush
™ regulations Sunday by helping

freshmen move into their rooms.

* According to the approved Rush

ecalendar, the “no contact’’ period

began Sunday, barring fraternity
members from entering the fresh-

«man dorms starting that day.

, “I haven’t investigated it yet,”
said Hayne. ‘‘We are going to investi-

‘gate it, though.”

+ The IFC’s judicial board will study
the charges next week, Hayne said.

Hayne said he learned that Sigma

‘Nu was helping freshmen move into

there, the fraternity had stopped.

Jaimie got there that night. When he
told us to stop, we stopped.”

Sigma Nu President Ernest Frank-
lin said the entire incident was the
result of a ‘calendar mishap.”

“The calendar we received last
spring at an IFC meeting said that
‘no contact’ began at 9 a.m. Monday
morning,” Franklin said.

‘No contact’ has always started
when orientation began,” Hamilton
added.

Franklin also said the calendar he
received last year made no restric-
tions on Wednesday night parties,
while the current calendar forbids
any weekday parties during Rush.

“This calendar screw-up is going to
cost us a lot of money,” Franklin
said.

However, Hayne said the calendar
released last spring is the same one
in effect now.

“The first calendar that came out
was a proposal,” Hayne said. ‘“‘It still
had to be approved by the University
Council and the Student Affairs Com-

ls

RUSH:

mittee. It was never finalized until
the end of the year.”’

Hamilton said the fraternity helped
the move in as a public service.

“It was really done in the vein of us
remembering how it was,”’ Hamilton
said. “Besides, it was hot and there
was enough confusion already. We
were merely performing a service.”’

Sophomore Sigma Nu Jon Solomon
said the incident should improve his
house’s Rush program.

“If meeting people is the key to
Rush, then I think it was a great
help,” Solomon said.

Hayne, president of Kappa Alpha
fraternity, said his house distributed
calendars in the dorms but that it
was done Friday, before the ‘‘no con-
tact”’ period.

“My house, as far as I know, is the
only house that did it,’’ said Hayne.
“All I can say is that if any of the
other houses do it from here on out,
then they have broken Rush regula-
tions.’’

RUSH: THE BOOK LOOK

 

 

 

 

Frat book is guide to Rush Dear Mom

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

 

Here they come to the gate.
They’re positioned. The doors are
shut

There’s the bell.

And they’re off.

Rush: It’s jockeying time.

Unlike a horse race, however, it’s
often difficult to determine which
path to take to successfully reach the
finish line.

Robert Egan, a 1975 Harvard
graduate, travelled to 35 states to
write ‘‘From Here To Fraternity,” a
quasi-serious look at the whole scam.
In the 228-page book, Egan found
several! ways for freshmen to identify
top houses on campus.

For instance: “The sign of a
respected fraternity is one that can
get away with an occasional sexist
act such as sponsoring a size-D cup
only Wet-T-Shirt contest, and still at-
tract sorority girls to their parties.”

One of Egan’s other tests for a top
house is equally serious: ‘‘Scholastic
standing, the house officers of
academically-oriented houses will
tell you during rush, is what counts
most in making a top house. Don’t

believe it. Socially speaking, the
ability to quaff 3.2 beer will beat the
ability to grind for a 3.2 GPA anyday
Did you ever hear of a party being
called bad because none of the guys
hada 4.0?”

School locale also figures into
Egan’s formula for Greek evalua-
tion. Schools in Alaska, for example,
are listed under the ‘Out Of It”
category. ‘‘There are no Greeks in
Alaska. Besides, if there were, they’d
roadtrip south in a second.”

Egan divides the United States into
sections in his book, and Washington
and Lee falls into the ‘‘Greek Con-
federacy.’’ His description of the
category is as follows:

“In the South there are three major
highlights of life: birth, going Greek,
and marriage (four, if you count hav-
ing your offspring enter the Greek
house you were in). Greek life is
religion here, next to magnolia trees,
Robert E. Lee, and making up stories
about the heroic exploits of your Civil
War ancestors.”

Although his book is written in a
humorous vein, Egan had some ser-
ious questions for freshmen to ask
fraternity members. In particular,
he advises asking about the pledge
program and what it entails, its

 

= ia

 

 

length and the amount of time
pledges are required to spend at the
fraternity house. His questions on the
academic aspects of fraternities in-
clude finding out about study groups,
files of old tests and the minimum
GPA required for a pledge to go ac-

   

 

A tients

tive, as well as the overall GPA of a
house.

Egan’s advice may not always be
serious, but it is often important. He
ends his book by advising freshmen
to find out about the costs involved in
fraternity membership.

Sororities have not yet come to
Washington and Lee’s campus, but a
new book explaining what exactly
they are and detailing how to get into
one has. In fact, it has come from the
W&L campus.

“Rush: A Girl’s Guide To Sorority
Success,’’ by Margaret Ann Rose, a
third-year W&L law student, is an in-
formational guidebook that Rose
hopes people will take seriously.

“Some people may think that the
whole book is a joke,” she said. ‘‘I
wanted to put in both the good and the
bad. I certainly did not want to write
a book that made fun or parodied
sororities, although some people may
interpret it as that.”’

Rose attended the University of

' Texas as an undergraduate, and was

rush captain for her sorority, Zeta
Tau Alpha. Her book, she said, is not
meant to be like ‘‘From Here To Fra-
ternity.”’

“It was a very different kind of
book,” she explained. ‘‘The guy who
wrote it wasn’t in a national fraterni-
ty even though he did a lot of re-
search. He went to Harvard.”’

“T think his book parodies the
system,”’ Rose continued. ‘‘But I was
surprised that his advice on frater-
nities was similar to mine.”’

Rose added that she feels W&L is
ready for sororities this year. “‘I
think it would be a good idea to have
sororities this year,’’ she said. ‘‘One
hundred women is certainly enough
to start four sororities. It would help

the women get together.

In writing her book, Rose received
no assistance from national sorority
organizations, including her own.
“Sororities have gotten so much bad
press in the past,” she explained,
“that they would rather not talk. So I
sent out 200 questionnaires to deans,
rush chairmen and sororities.”

The similarities in sororities
across the nation was something that
Rose found interesting. ‘‘What was
surprising to me was that at big,
small, state or private schools,
sororities are basically the same,”
she said. ‘‘They have the same par-
ties, same selection process and
serve the same drinks and that was a
little surprising.”

Although the aim of the book is fac-
tual, Rose also tried to mix in some
humor. “I think some parts of the

in historic Lexington, Virginia

William Willson, postmaster, mer-
chant and treasurer of Washington
College, built his classical revival
home in 1820. The building remained
a residence until 1911 when Harry
Walker converted it into a meat
market and grocery store. Located in
the downtown historic district, today
it is Lexington’s most distinctive
restaurant decorated with period an-
tiques and offering dishes prepared
with the freshest and finest local and
regional ingredients along with an
assortment of American wines. The
Willson-Walker House proudly greets
its guests with the same warm welcome
that Capt. Willson would have extend-
sed over 160 years ago.

American cuisine. Cocktails, beer,
and wine. Open for lunch and dinner,

What | did this summer — three essays

 

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

A little of this ...

Senior Mike Brooks put his accounting major to work this
summer totalling the liquor tabs at the Noisy Oyster, a restau-
rant and raw bar on the Atlantic Avenue ‘‘Strip” in Virginia
Beach. Although he says the only drink mixing-experience
he’d had before was a little ‘‘bogus fraternity bartending,” he
liked the job so much that now he’s working at the Palm’s here
in Lexington. Brooks enjoys the ‘“‘energy’’ involved in the job
— the chance to meet and work with all kinds of people. He
said Palms customers are ‘“‘mostly a highball crowd,” order-
ing drinks like the rum and Coke he’s mixing here instead of
“more complicated layered and shaken drinks people at the
«-, beach preferred. An example is a ‘‘skip and go naked,’’ which
has rum, vodka, grenadine and half a dozen other ingredients.
‘You can light it if you want,”’ Brooks said.

IFC president works on Capitol Hill

For senior Jaimie Hayne, the
chance to work in Washington as an
intern for his hometown’s congress-
man required several years of rejec-
tion.

But for a month this summer,
Hayne researched voting behavior,
answered constituents’ mail and sat
in on staff meetings.

The experience of being on Capitol
Hill was “‘incredible’’ at times, said
Hayne, who is president of the Wash-
ington and Lee Interfraternity Coun-
cil.

Hayne applied for the Lyndon B.
Johnson internship program a couple
of years in a row before being ac-
cepted.

He was selected for the position,
which carried a total salary of $960,
on the basis of a formal application.

Hayne worked in the office of
Congressman Thomas Loeffler, a Re-
publican in the 21st District of Texas,
which includes Hayne’s hometown of
San Antonio.

As an intern, Hayne’s job included
researching the voting habits of
congressmen on certain issues in re-
cent years.

Hayne believes he was more in-
volved with his congressman’s office

Few students would be likely to
travel three weeks to get to campus
for a six-week session — unless of
course that campus were the Univer-
sity of Oxford in England, with the
realm of Europe just across the
Channel.

This summer, seven members of
the Phi Delta Theta fraternity organ-
ized a three-week tour of European
countries before heading to St.
Anne’s College at Oxford for a spec-
ial summer session designed for Vir-
ginia students.

Bourke Harvey, a senior this year
and one of the seven, said that be-
sides the initial three weeks there
was plenty of free time to travel
while going to school.

Each student participated in two
courses on the literature, history and
society of late 16th- and 17-century

England, including the Elizabethan,
Jacobean and Caroline periods.

“It wasn’t really hard work,”
Harvey said, “but it was challeng-
ing.”’

According to Harvey, the system of
education at Oxford is much different
from American procedures.

Each of the six academic weeks be-
gan with a meeting between a group
of three students and a tutor. The
tutor assigned the students a theme
for a paper due at the end of the
week.

Throughout the week the students
attended 1'2 hour lectures based on
the central theme of the course of
study.

Harvey said the lectures were of-
ten useful in organizing ideas for the
weekly papers, which were called tu-
torials.

Often, discussion of the tutorials
would lead to debates among the stu-
dents.

For example, Harvey said he was

 

than most other interns because his
responsibilities included answering
constituents’ mail and sitting in on
staff meetings.

While in Washington, Hayne lived
in a dormitory at Georgetown Uni-
versity, where he said he met many
other students working as interns in
the Capitol.

Hayne said he is not necessarily
looking into a political career and
said he applied for the internship to
learn more about the legislative pro-
cess.

Another consideration was the city
life in Washington.

“Georgetown is fun,’’ he said, “Es-
pecially at night.”

part of a group taking a stand on
whether James I was an effective
ruler of England.

“One book we used said he was to-
tally ineffective while another said
he wasn’t quite as bad as people have
been led to believe,”’ Harvey said.

As a history major, Harvey said
he viewed the opportunity at St.
Anne’s as a unique chance to get an
understanding of England’s past as
well as to travel.

Running from July 1 to Aug. 10, the
Virginia Program at Oxford is spon-
sored by W&L, Hampden-Sydney
College, Mary Baldwin College, Roa-
noke College, Sweet Briar College
and Virginia Military Institute.

Thirteen W&L students partici-
pated in this year’s session, which
had an enrollment of approximately
60.

Each student earned academic
credit for six semester hours.

Included with the academics, the
program offered an excursion to a

Oxford session attracts W&L travelers

Shakespeare Festival at Stratford-
upon-Avon.

Also, students were able to tour a
number of castles not far from Ox-
ford.

London, an hour away, was also a
favorite trip, according to Harvey.
He said a night clyb, the Hippo-
drome, became a regular attraction.

On one occasion, Harvey said, he
was part of a group of students who
spent one night in London visiting 28
different pubs and having a beer at
each one.

“We weren't exactly standing by
the end of the night,”’ he said.

The summer session at St. Anne’s
is designed for rising seniors and
juniors, although exceptionally quali-
fied rising sophomores may be con-
sidered.

The program fee for the 1985 ses-
sion was $1,875. More information
can be obtained from Associate Dean
of the College Pamela Simpson.

ROTC student goes
to Air Assault School

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
News Editor

 

Despite the 3 a.m. wakeup calls,
the 4 a.m. inspections and the 4:30
a.m. physical fitness training, junior
David Shugart considered it ‘‘an
honor to go and represent my school’’
at the Air Assault School at Fort
Rucker, Ala.

Shugart, who spent 10 days at an in-
tense helicopter training session, was
selected by Washington and Lee’s
ROTC department to attend the avia-
tion school, which is a training camp
for all army personnel.

The camp included phases of train-
ing designed to teach the 105 men and
three women how to participate in
combat with helicopters as a means
of transportation.

Besides the helicopter training; the
cadets began physical fitness train-
ing at 4:30a.m.

After calisthenics, the cadets

would either run or take a ‘forced.
road march”’ with full gear at a mini-
mum rate of one kilometer per 10
minutes.

Shugart said the daily inspection
was something that “really moti-
vated you to shine your boots.”’ The
reason, he said, is the effect of ac-
quiring a ‘“‘deficiency”’ for something
as slight as having a mark on the uni-
form’s belt buckle or a haircut that is
just a little too long.

According to Shugart, such cauc.
were sent to an area known as the
“gig pit, where a sergeant would
‘gig’ you until you about dropped
dead.’’ Gigging included intense ca-
listhenics, such as push-ups and sit-
ups.
“I was not gigged,”’ Shugart re-
ported.

Although involved in W&L’s ROTC
program, Shugart said he is not defi-
nite about an army career.

“That’s in the future,’’ he said.
“Tt’s an option.”

Virginia’s Lexington has its own charm

“People who come to Washington
and Lee fall in love,” Student Body
President John Lewis told a parents’
orientation session on Sunday. “They
fall in love with the beautiful campus,
they fall in love with the articulate pro-
fessors, they fall in love with the
magnificent scenery which surrounds
them, and they fall in love with each
other.”

Many of them also fall in love with
Lexington itself. One person who did is
reporter Laura Bruno, whose outsider’s
view of our city is reprinted with per-
mission from the Chicago Tribune of
Aug. Il:

Attention, history buffs. You know
well of Lexington, Mass., where the
opening shot of the Revolutionary
War was fired, and of Lexington, Ky.,
traditional breeding ground for many
of this nation’s finest thoroughbred
race horses. But are you schooled in
a third Lexington — in Virginia —
another distinct patch on the colorful
quilt of America’s heritage?

This quaint town, nestled in the
southeastern region of the Shenan-
doah Valley just off 1-81, boasts
among other attractions the homes
and graves of Thomas ‘‘Stonewall’’
Jackson and Robert E. Lee, the li-
brary and museum of World War II
Gen. George C. Marshall, and the
tradition-steeped campuses of Wash-
ington and Lee University and Vir-
ginnia Military Institute. The colos-
sal limestone Natural Bridge, one of
the seven natural wonders of the
world, is nearby.

Any drive to Lexington, about an
hour from Charlottesville and three
from Washington, D.C., promises
gorgeous scenery, especially the
Blue Ridge Mountains. The only rival
view might be from the peaks as you
wind along the Blue Ridge Parkway.

Two young couples, one from
Atlanta, the other from Indiana, had

Horse and buggy tours of Lexington began this summer

route to this town. At the McCamp-
bell Inn on Main Street, one of the
Historic Country Inns of Lexington,
the foursome joined other guests in
the Great Room for complimentary
sherry and port, served nightly.
Charmingly decorated with anti-
ques and rich wood furnishings, each
room of the Country Inns contains a
refrigerator, hot pot, juice, and tea
and coffee makings. Under the same

ownership and management are two
restored townhouses on Main Street,
with 15 rooms and 8 suites between
them, and a refurbished plantation
home. On 60 acres just a few miles
from town, the third inn will have 14
rooms and a dining room and will of-
fer horseback riding and _ hiking
trails. In addition to free sherry in
the evening at the Inns, homemade
muffins are offered for breakfast.

Cable may solve TV crunch
for Graham-Lees freshmen

 

By SEAN BUGG
Staff Reporter

 

Although there are TV rooms in the
freshmen dorms, conflicts some-
times can arise over what should be
watched. For some students who
prefer movies to football (or vice ver-
sa) or ‘General Hospital” to ‘Days
of Our Lives,”’ there is hope.

Unfortunately, Gilliam and Davis
dormitories must continue under the
present system. However, students
in Graham-Lees and upperclassmen

living elsewhere have cable televi-
sion services available to them.

To get cable, one must go to the
Lexington Cable Co. office at 5 West
Nelson St. where arrangements to in-
stall cable in dorm rooms can be
made. The initial cost for basic cable
services is $25, which must be paid
when the contract is made.

To obtain the pay-TV channel
Home Box Office, an additional $25
deposit must be made. This deposit
entitles one to an HBO decoder box.

Unlike the $25 for basic cable, the
deposit for HBO is refundable at the

Students line up at the Centel office for phone service

Students calling home
have two alternatives

 

By SEAN BUGG
Staff Reporter

 

Of the many things freshmen
might want to accomplish in their
first few days at Washington and
Lee, one of the most confusing is get-
ting a telephone hook-up in the
dormitories.

Students wanting a phone line have
two options available to them.

The first option is to deal directly
with Central Telephone, the local
phone company. Centel is located at
102 E. Washington St., about three
blocks from campus. The office
hours are 9a.m. to5p.m.

Dealing directly with Centel re-
quires a $90 deposit to ensure pay-
ment of bills. The deposit earns in-
terest during the year and is returned
along with that interest at the end of
the year,

Another route students can take is
to join the Student Telephone Union,
which guarantees Centel that stu
dents will pay their bills. By paying
the fee to join STU, a student can
avoid paying the $90 deposit.

The cost of joining STU is deter-
mined by how many years the stu-
dent has been a member. A first-year
member pays $7, a second-year
member pays four dollars, and the
third and fourth years are free of
charge. Unlike the $90 deposit, these
fees are not refundable.

Tom O’Brien, chairman of STU,
will be at Centel this week during of-
fice hours. When classes begin, the
STU office will be in Room 209 of the
University Center. The hours for that
office have not been determined.

STU’s purpose is to ‘“‘make sure
things run smoothly between Centel
and students,’’ O’Brien said.

Regardless of which of the two
routes a student takes, there is a
$23.85 hook-up fee, which is payable
with the $90 deposit, or on the first
bill if the student joins STU.

The basie rate for local service is
$12.17 for dial phones and $13.47 for
touch-tone phones. AT&T long dis-
tance service of course is extra

None of these costs include the
telephones themselves, but phones
can be bought from Centel starting at
$30

a5 250

end of the year with the return of the
decoder box.

After the initial fees and installa-
tion, there is a monthly billing. The
charge for basic cable is $8 per
month. HBO carries an additional
charge of $9.50, making the total
charge $17.50

Presently, Lexington Cable Co. of-
fers a total of 13 channels, including
HBO. Included in the basic cable
channels are affiliates of all three
major networks, WTBS in Atlanta,
ESPN, and Washington and Lee’s
own Cable Nine.

opening of the Willson-Walker House.
“White tablecloths, ambiance —
we're going the whole nine yards,”
said chef Ron Wood. The restored
19th-Century private home features
American cuisine, he said and ac-
commodates 50 people in the dining
room, slightly more in the banquet
room, Entrees range from $7.50 to

$13.50.
A sense of history pervades Lex-

ington. A visitor is linked to the past
just by strolling the brick sidewalks
of the “‘business district.” Brick
facades and antique signs look as if
they might have been erected in 1796
when Lexington was rebuilt after a
fire destroyed many of its 100 log-
and-frame houses. A local ordinance
protects the historic appearanoe:
hence, even the Quality Quick Print
shop [where copies cost 8 cents
apiece] has a 19th-Century air. In-
deed, the storefronts on present-day
Main Street hardly differ from those
on the enclosed Old Main Street Shop-
ping Mall.

To connect more fully with history,
enter the restored Stonewall Jackson
House, the only attraction with an ad-
mission charge. The General bought
his home a few years before he enter-
ed the Civil War and did not live to
see it again. Many furnishings be-
longed to Jackson and his wife.

Much of the VMI Museum is dedi-
cated to Stonewall’s military career: -
and to his professorship at “the West”
Point of the South.” For 10 years he:

taught natural and experimental’:
philosophy plus artillery tactics —:-

not your typical combination.

An elderly couple from Michigan: -
admired Jackson’s teaching uni-'-

form. Driving through Lexington the

night before, they had made an im-':
promptu dinner stop. ‘‘We asked the |:
waitress what was around here, and |.
when she started naming everything, ::
we decided to stay on a bit,”’ the hus- ‘+
band said. :

other times.

They found the following:

Police say that at about 11:40 p.m.
on May 18, 85-year-old Hattie
Newsom was killed at her house with
two shots from a .45-caliber semiau-
tomatic pistol. Her son Robert
Newsom Jr. died after being shot five
times, and his wife, Florence
Newsom, fatally suffered two gun-
shot wounds and two stab wounds.

The three were the grandmother,
uncle and aunt, respectively, of
Frederick R. Klenner, a 32-year-old
friend of Perkins who was active in
the so-called survivalist movement.

About half an hour after the deaths
— at 12:02 a.m. on May i9 — Klenner
was stopped near the house by a
sheriff's officer who thought Klenner
was driving too slowly. Perkins was
following Klenner’s car in a Chevro-
let Blazer.

Klenner died June 3 when the same
Blazer exploded during a_ police
chase north of Greensboro.

(He was traveling with his 39-year-
old first cousin, Susie Newsom
Lynch, with whom he was living, and
her two children — Jim, 9, and John,
10. Lynch and the children’s father,
Dr. Thomas J. Lynch, an Albuquer-
que, N.M., dentist, were engaged in a
court battle for custody of the chil-

dren. Klenner, authorities said,
thought his relatives might be help-
ing Lynch.

(A few days before the explosion,
Klenner had vowed police would
never take him alive, and authorities
later ruled the bomb that killed he
and Lynch had been intentionally de-
tonated during the chase.

(Autopsies on the children found
that they had been shot in the head at
short range and had traces of cya-
nide in their stomachs. )

On May 19, though, there was no
high-speed pursuit. The officer be-
lieved Klenner’s story that he was
having car trouble and let him go.
According to investigators, Klenner
and Perkins then drove to Greensbo-
ro and later traveled toward Lex-
ington.

On May 18 and again when they re-
turned May 19, the two camped at the
Peaks of Otter, a wilderness lodge
area on the Blue Ridge Parkway
near Buchanan. Authorities now
charge that was part of an elaborate
alibi devised by Klenner, who they
say was responsible for the slayings.

No one contends Perkins partici-
pated in any of the killings. Forsyth
County District Attorney Donald W.
Tisdale emphasized that Perkins is
not being accused of being at the
scene of the crime, but ‘‘as far as the
general area where the bodies were
— yes.”

Tisdale says Perkins came into the
picture when investigators talked
with Klenner several days after the
killings, and he began trying to pass
off the Peaks of Otter alibi. They
immediately traveled to Lexington to
interview Perkins about his role in
the case.

Perkins, Tisdale explained, was
“the weak link’ in Klenner’s story.
“If someone was going to break, it
wasn’t going to be Klenner — it was
going to be Perkins,”’ he said.

North Carolina SBI agent Hunt

said his agents made “more than

one” trip to Lexington to talk with
Perkins, but he declined to be more
specific.

It was during those interviews that

and historical areas have been order-
ed for the walls.

Darrell said he hoped that students
would be supportive of the changes,
but added that he realized not every-
one will be completely happy with it.

While the name will be changed,
Darrell said that the Cockpit sign will
remain above the entrance and a sec-

Perkins said he thought he was in-
volved with a CIA offensive against
narcotics traffickers.

Tisdale said he thinks Perkins
“absolutely believed it,’ but admit-
ted some initial skepticism about the
situation. ‘Anyone that told me he
was working for the CIA — that’s a
little strange just in itself,’’ he said

Investigators then told Perkins
what they suspected of Klenner’s in-
volvement. ‘‘I think he was shock-
ed,”’ Tisdale said. ‘I explained to
him that it was a dangerous situa-
tion.”

At that point, apparently panicked,
Perkins agreed to aid authorities in
nailing down their case against Klen-
ner. ‘He was about as cooperative as
I would think he could be,”’ Tisdale
said.

“I think he’s spotless,”’ the district
attorney said. ‘‘He would be a classic
college student .... clean-cut. He has
a nice mother and stepfather and
comes from a respected family.”

Barker said Perkins bought the
CIA line because of the great admira-
tion and respect he'd built for Klen-
ner. “He had had influences over
Perkins for some time before this,’
Barker said. ‘‘Klenner had convinced
him that he was a medical doctor and
a member of the CIA.”

The sheriff's officer also sees
Perkins as something of a tragic
figure who fell for a tremendous hoax
by a longtime friend. He said Per-
kins’ role could even be viewed as ‘‘in
a sense patriotic,’’ because he believ-
ed he was carrying out a ‘“‘dangerous
government mission.” :

Violet R. Firebaugh, who rented a
room in her Lexington house to Per-
kins last year, said “he was a won-
derful boy’’ who was always very
“sweet’’ to her and frequently
brought friends to her home.

She said that last spring ‘‘he seem-
ed like he was working undercover
for somebody” but that at first he ap-
parently didn’t know what he was in-
volved in. ‘‘I think he realized it last
time,” she said.

“He came here and got his things
out of my house”’ in June, she said. ‘‘I
knew that he was in some kind of
trouble — at the time I didn’t know
what .... He was crying and he said,
“T didn’t do it — I don’t know any-
thing about it.” ”

Harrison J. Pemberton Jr., chair-
man of W&L’s philosophy depart-
ment and Perkins’ faculty adviser,
said Perkins was in Lexington the
week before the indictment “‘to clear
out his apartment.”

“He knew it was coming up, but he
wasn’t sure what would happen,”
Pemberton said of the grand jury ac-
tion. ‘‘He was pretty surprised — he
didn’t know he was dealing with a
crazy man.”’

He said that during the spring
term, possibly the weekend of May
18, Perkins said he would be going
out of town, so he had to turn in a
philosophy paper late.

‘‘He told me he would be away for a
while,’’ Pemberton recalled. ‘‘He ac-
ted pretty mysterious about it.”

“He said he didn’t know what was
going on,’’ Pemberton concluded, re-
flecting on the events of the previous
few weeks.

“He knows now.”’

Perkins, who had been registered
at W&L for the fall term, is serving
the time at Raleigh’s Polk Youth
Center, a medium-security facility
for offenders between the ages of 18
and 21.

been preserved for posterity.

With these changes already made
and several more being considered,
Darrell said he hopes GHQ can gain
more student support.

“We are here for the students,” he
said, ‘‘and we hope that they are sup-
portive. If not, I don’t think I can go
another year absorbing the same
kind of losses I have the past two
years. If closed as a tavern, it would
then be used as an extension of Evans

Dining Hall, for meal-plan dinners and

special banquets.”’
