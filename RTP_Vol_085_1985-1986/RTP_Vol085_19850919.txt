Girard jailed for five more months

 

GENE GIRARD
Pleaded guilty to possession

 

By JIM STRADER
News Editor

 

Washington and Lee senior Gene Girard yester-
day was sentenced to an additional five months in
jail for a cocaine possession conviction.

The sentence was for five years, with all but six
months suspended. The five weeks Girard has
served since pleading guilty last month will be ap-
plied to the sentence.

“T obviously think that’s not a bad resolution to
this case,’ defense attorney Laurence A. Mann
said. He added Girard has not mentioned an ap-
peal.

Commonwealth’s Attorney Beverly C. “John”
Read, who asked the Rockbridge Circuit Court to
impose a sentence of not less than five years in
prison, declined comment after the sentencing.

Girard, a former tri-captain of the W&L football

 

team, was arrested March | at the East Lexington
grocery store in connection with a package con-
taining 29 grams of cocaine that was sent to the
store.

He was tried in June before a jury in a pro-
ceeding that ended in a mistrial, and pleaded guil-
ty Aug. 13 at a second trial. Since then he has been
in the Rockbridge County Jail.

Girard matriculated last week and attended
classes Monday and Tuesday. The registrar’s of-
fice said yesterday he is still registered as a stu-
dent.

Other provisions of Girard’s sentence are five
years’ probation following his release from jail,
periodic urinalysis to detect drug use during pro-
bation, and an agreement to refrain from associa-
tion with drugs.

W&L law Professor William S. Geimer said
Girard’s sentence was not unusual

“It appears to me to be within the (normal)

 

 

range, given the circumstances of the case,” he
said.

“T wouldn’t second-guess a five-year sentence
with all but six months suspended,’ Geimer con-
tinued. ‘‘And it’s not out of line with hundreds of
similar cases I’m familiar with.”

Geimer reasoned that a stiffer sentence was not
imposed because Girard’s case involved a first of-
fense and because he pleaded guilty. Geimer said
that although the nature of the substance involved
and the possibility of abuse are serious matters to
consider legally, he feels that “justice was serv-
ed.”

In imposing the sentence, Circuit Judge George
E. Honts III said he felt that because Girard was
“clearly a leader’ at W&L, his guilt itself was
a punishment. However, Honts made no provi-
sions in the sentence for Girard, of Coral Gables
Fla

New rules
branded

‘un-Wé&L’

By MIKE ALLEN
Executive Editor

 

 

Several members of the Executive
Committee charged Monday that
three new University policies are
“ridiculous”’ and ‘‘very un-W&L.”’

The new Student Control Commit-
tee guidelines, the mandate that dor-
mitory counselors report freshman
drinking and a new bookstore rule re-
quiring students to present a ‘‘credit
card’”’ to charge books all came
under fire at the EC’s first meeting of
the year.

President John Lewis objected to
the changes on two grounds: First,
that undergraduate input is being
discounted at a school where ‘“‘stu-
dent opinion has always been very,
very important’’; and second, that in
contrast to Washington and Lee’s tra-
ditional and unspecific concept of

  

honorable, gentlemanly conduct,
“we suddenly have a very codified

During the first night of school the
dorms really come alive, especially
after weekend Rush parties. Every-
body has heard of the excess. It’s
usually the janitors, though, that see
it the next morning. And that’s when
the stories are told.

In the words of one freshman:
‘More than anything else, the dorms
have been filled with people puking
their guts out.”’

‘I don’t remember what happen-
ed,” said a rushee from Georgia. “I
just woke up the next morning with
fuzz up top. It was a wild night and a
lot of fun — I think.”

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

Kappa Sigma’s Steve Prindle fires off a round signalling the start of another Rush date for the freshmen going through Rush

Post-party dorms ‘not a pretty sight’

based on the final report of last
year’s Drug Policy Review Commit-
tee, delineates ‘‘major’’ and ‘‘minor”’
offenses under the committee's juris-
diction.

“This is a slap in the face to the
whole system we live under,’’ Lewis
said. ‘‘The whole system is very un-
W&L.”

Even the upperclassmen some-
times have trouble keeping up.

“IT was walking up to the front
porch to meet some of the brothers,”’
a Virginia freshman recalled. ‘‘They
took me to meet some of the other
guys and when I reached out my
hand to this one guy he passed out
— cold. The guy was like noodles.”’

One of the women in Davis Dormi-
tory agreed about the numbing ef-
fects of parties, particularly on the
day after.

“The mornings are real quiet
because everyone is still hung over,”
she said. ‘‘On the girls’ floors, it
seems like it’s been quieter than on
the guys’ floors.”

A freshman from New Jersey
sketched his experience: ‘“‘We had
had a few beers and one house of-

fered us some kamikazes. Of course,
we accepted. After a few more beers,
I went back to my room and started
to feel a little queasy. Then I went to
the bathroom and barfed. And when I
came back, I barfed in my bed.

“Next morning I was crowded to
the far end of the bed and the room
smelled really bad. I guess I rolled
around in ita little.

“TL even remember most of it.”’

Another freshman from Tennessee
got revenge on one of his drunk
friends for an earlier prank.

“I got one of my friends back for
sticking his stinky shoes in my face,”
he said. ‘‘He passed out in his room
and I went in there with my magic
markers. By the end of the session,
he had grown a curly mustache, a
goatee, some stars and hearts.”’

Rating brews: ‘buzz per buck factor’

A different Volunteer State fresh-
man found it profitable to leave his
door open.

“T remember coming in one night
really late and I walked into my room
and I left the door open and these
drunk girls kept walking in and talk-
ing about nothing,”’ he said.

Tommy Sloan of Buildings and
Grounds, who works in Graham-
Lees, said the dorms after parties
are ‘‘nota pretty sight.”’

“One kid this past weekend waited
until he got in the shower to throw
up,”’ he said. “‘Sometimes it’s in the
hall but they usually make it to the
bathroom.”

Meanwhile, Sloan of Buildings and
Grounds offers this advice: ‘‘If you
can’t party with the big boys, stay off
the field.”

Second year law representative
Bill Thompson expressed concern
about the possible ‘‘double jeopardy”
that could result if an offense were
found to fall under the jurisdiction of
both the EC and the SCC.

He said he and Lewis have drafted
a statement that would eliminate
that danger and that they would
discuss it with members of the facul-
ty that developed the policy.

“From what I can gather, many
faculty would back us on any amend-
ments we might offer,’’ Thompson
said.

Senior Representative Pat Hayden
cautioned, however, that while it
may be possible to change some pro-
visions in the policy, the new discipli-

W&L students have always prided
themselves on their upward mobility and
good taste, and the beers they drink rein-
force this perception. What proper W&L
gentleman or lady would be caught dead
with Old Milwaukee in their refrigerator
on Fancy Dress week? What better way
is there to relax in the frat hot tub than
with a cold bottle of some unpronoun
ceable Czechoslovakian beer? Chris and
I were determined to find out just what
beer gave you the most Buzz Per Buck
(BPB), and the results were surprising.

With our moderator and referee Walt
Devine, we set out to the Palm’s and pick-

ed out 10 beers that would be easily
recognizable to the well-versed drinker.
It was a blind taste test, with Walt pour-
ing the beers as we averted our eyes.
Chris and I would then rate the beers,
clean our palates with some water and
then Walt would pour the next beer. The
beers were rated on a scale of one to 10
with 10 being perfect in all respects. The
results were as follows:

Miller Lites

We both knew from the pale color that
this was an American beer, but on the
whole the taste was rather smooth. The
big word for this beer was “drinkabili-
ty,” because it went down so easily and
had no bad aftertaste.

Chris was a little more impressed with
this beer than I was, but we both thought
it had a good imported taste and would

Chris — 7; Jamie — 6

The ‘‘King of Beers’’ didn’t fare so well
in our taste test. The color was rather
weak and it had a slightly sweet taste
that neither of us enjoyed too much. It
was the bitter aftertaste that bothered
me most about this beer. Chris did note
that at least it was a good belching beer. I
didn’t see fit to argue the point.

2/OPINION
Changing

When the Board of Trustees decided to make this institu-
tion coeducational, it recognized that certain changes would
necessarily encompass the campus. Dorms would be remod-
eled and the looker room would have to be divided to allow for
privacy for the new students.

A committee on coeducation was created to oversee the
changes, to “help guide us in every step of the way,” as
President John D. Wilson stated upon its creation. The com-
mittee, consisting of professors, administrators and stu-
dents, met faithfully last year, and the ease with which this
year has begun is to their credit.

But change was not delegated alone to those on the commit-
tee. Others in the University, eager to help in the transition,
began a cleaning of their respective houses, ferreting out the
unpleasant or offensive and trying to create a welcoming en-
vironment for the women students. But they — like most who
have the power to change — seem to be taking their charge a
bit too far. Somewhere along the line, focus has been lost on
part of the goal the University hoped to achieve. Change has
become the magical password on a campus where sudden de-
cisions had been anathema for well over 200 years.

Consider the lights on campus. Sure, safety ought to be a
concern for the campus. Rape, whether we like to admit it or
not, is certainly a present reality in this community. Even
muggings have occurred. But something has been lost on this
campus when mercury vapor lights as bright as a spring day
illuminate the entire campus from dusk to dawn. Forget the
divine commandment to separate the day from the night.
This was not good.

A great part of the camaraderie and identification I
developed with the campus came from those few nights when
I was able to walk home and see the Colonnade softly lit by
hidden lights. That seems now to be a luxury that can exist
only in one’s memory.

Or there are the cute little vases and plastic flowers that sit
on the tables in the Co-op and the dining hall. If they were
real flowers, that would be one thing, but isn’t this taking the
“feminization” of the campus a bit too far? Plastic, like
polyester, deserves to sit elsewhere.

And though they deny up and down that it had anything to
do with the entrance of the women, the re-naming of the
Cockpit to ‘‘General Headquarters’’ (or coolly spoken,
‘*GHQ’’) seems a bit out of place and completely unneces-
sary. Even freshmen women wonder why this fuss was
created around them. If the concern for the old name was
that it might be “‘sexually offensive,” fine. At least admit so.
But the name never seemed to be of much concern until last
spring, when the coeducation machine really began to heat
up.
Maybe it is all a lamentation of the way things used to be.
Maybe it’s that I liked the days when a spade was a spade.
But too many changes for the mere sake of change seem to be

transforming this campus into a new and different institution...

from that which has existed for the past 236 years. Much that
makes Washington and Lee what it is has to do with the tradi-
tions that it guards and the honor it ascribes to such acts.
Subtle changes, anywhere along the line, have profound ef-
fects for all in the future.

Coeducation inevitably meant change and still means that
today. The past, the saying goes, cannot be reclaimed, nor
should we necessarily desire it to be. But these with the
power to change ought to guard that privilege with greater
care. Those with a political or philosophical predisposition
should not change this University for their tastes, especially
when their changes meet with such ridicule and disdain from
the freshmen women themselves. Maybe it has never occur-
red to those with the power to change the appearance and en-
vironment of the University that the women who now attend
this school do so because they liked what they saw when they
visited last fall, winter or spring, and not because of what
they found last week. —NRP

Reader whines over
panacea, Sour grapes’

To the Editors: to stay in such an unpleasant atmos-

 

 

I was very disturbed to read Nelson
Patterson’s editorial ‘No Panacea?”’
in last week’s edition of The Phi. It
was at best a vague and meandering
lamentation of sour grapes; at worst,
it says to our new female students,
“Well, we didn’t want you, but I
guess we're stuck — just don’t expect
me to like you or try and help you in
any way.”’ If this is indeed what Mr.
Patterson meant, he may have his
wish for a single-sex campus, for I
cannot imagine many people wishing

Smirk irks;
fie on

The Phi

To the Editors:

I read with great bemusement the
inquiring column ‘The Smirk” in
last week’s Phi. I find it difficult to
believe a college newspaper striving
for journalistic excellence could be
found ranked with the likes of Star
Magazine, Weekly World News and
the Globe. Journalistic principles of
excellence and gentlemanlyness (or
should it be civility?) have been ab-
dicated here.

Having been enrolled in the class of
a master journalist from Polk Coun-
ty, Iowa, last year, I know higher
principles must be applied when peo-
ple’s integrity is in question.

If this is another compromise of
coeducation, I ask you, is it a
panacea also?

David A. Shugart
Class of 1987

phere as his attitude will create.

It’s not that the thesis of Mr. Pat-
terson’s editorial was so incorrect.
There has been a tendency for some
of us (myself included at times) to
consider coeducation as a cure-all for
the ills of the University. The editor-
ial could have made a good point in
reminding us that the addition of a
hundred-odd women to W&L will not
solve all its problems and will pro-
bably cause some others. But were
phrases like ‘‘sinister plots’ and
“Business for John D. Wilson meant
coeducation”’ really necessary?
Were pot shots at Tech and U.Va.,
and insinuations that some members
of the Board of Trustees didn’t really
care all that much about W&L, re-
quired for Mr. Patterson to make his
point? I’m as conservative as the
next guy here at Republican U., but
even I think the description of the
“faculty, in their lofty moments of
liberal idealism,” was uncalled for, if
not unfair. Such pointless and non-in-
tellectual digression makes the edi-
torial truly disappointing. It was not
a humorous article, nor was it infor-
mative — although it had the poten-
tial for both. If we must have a nega-
tive attitude, let us at least stick to
the facts and not get into arguments
over the value of the New Deal or
new Coke.

Coeducation may not be a panacea,
but can we at least give it a chance?
When the editorial was written, wo-
men had not yet been registered for
their fall term classes! If coeduca-
tion cannot cure everything, I hope
that it can at least cure some things
— like bad attitudes and fuzzy think-
ing.

Freshmen still will be freshmen

 

By NELSON PATTERSON
Editorial Page Editor

 

For all the attention that this
year’s freshman class is getting, one
would think that things might be a bit
different with them. The stories in
The Washington Post, USA Today,
and other major publications portray
the newly-arriveds as if they were a
bunch of laboratory mice: here for
the first experiment with a supposed
carcinogen called coeducation, and
most likely going to encounter severe
overdoses of chauvinistic radiation
that will deter future mice from land-
ing positions in entering classes.

ba “Winehow. however, I: doubt that:

this year’s freshman class is really
all that different from those that
have entered Washington and Lee
during my four years here. They go
to classes (now, that might make
them different...), eat Letty Pate
food (that will render them dif-
ferent), go through Rush (though not
in as great numbers), and stand
around their dorm hallways at night
talking about their days and wonder-
ing about their nights. They tend, like
all college students with the first
drinks ‘“‘away from home,”’ to drink
too much and party too long. But big
deal — all that is part of what obser-
vers call the mystical ‘‘college exper-
ience.’’ And what an experience it
must be.

I suppose that I really don’t expect
these freshmen and women to be any-
thing different. They are human,
after all. And while the admissions
office has served us well with intelli-
gence and enthusiasm as prerequisi-
tes for entrance, they also found a
freshman class that is willing (might
eager be a better word?) to accept
the limelight for the interim in hopes
that the excitement will die down in
the long run.

But for all the praises that might be
sung of the entering class, they also
have their weaknesses. When the
midterms come, I am sure that fresh-
men will be freshmen, and grades
will always be lower than they ex-
pected. Maybe professors will have
reality shock and see that freshmen
women are as vulnerable to acade-
mic deficiencies as their male coun-
terparts. Heaven forbid. And when
one sex (as inevitably the compari-
son will be made) has a better GPA
than the other, what will be said?
Well, my my, as one professor loves
to lecture.

The greatest fear I hold for the
entering class is that with the weight
of the inordinately high expectations
being placed upon it, the slightest
slip-up will be seized upon as evi-
dence of the obvious failure of coedu-
cation. High expectations are rarely
realized, and we shouldn’t expect
these freshmen to be that different
from the three other classes seen
here now. There will be honor viola-
tions from freshmen; there will even

Lewis cites Post flaws

To the Editors:

Last week I was “interviewed” by
a Ms. Eve Zibart of The Washington
Post. I put interviewed in quotation
marks because it was over a beer in
the Cockpit and she never took any
notes whatsoever. The result, which
was published Monday, was a jum-
bled mass of negative and deroga-
tory statements, most of which were
taken completely out of context and
many of which were completely
false. I believe she came looking for a
great deal of chauvinism and bad
feeling. Since she did not find it, she
created it. She spoke with President
John D. Wilson for over an hour and
never mentioned him. She spoke with
Admissions Director William Hartog

and got his first name wrong. The
subtitle read, ‘‘Amid Grumbling, 115
Women Join 200-year-old, Formerly
All-male Bastion in Virginia,”’

I admit readily that I was an oppo-
nent of coeducation. I also admit that
now that they are here, I am enjoying
them immensely. I admit even more
readily that much of their story is
completely incorrect. It’s funny that
this is the only negative press we
have received during this whole ex-
perience. To students, faculty and
the administration, please accept my
apologies for speaking with this
woman, and let us continue with our
newest tradition.

be students who drop out from this
class because of academic or social
pressures. There might even be
(dare I say the word) pregnancies.
But then again, Washington and Lee
has entered the realm of the ‘‘other”’
universities and must encounter
these other big campus realities
sooner or later. It is hoped the bubble
will burst with some ease, if such a
feat is possible.

I suppose that the best anyone can
wish for the freshmen is that they en-

joy their four years. For all the pre-
paration that has gone into their four
years in college, for all the sense of
experimenting that they have sur-

an experiment), for all the times that
they will complain about 8 o’clock

another in the tradition called Wash-

ington and Lee. College is more than ‘

studying and partying, and
Washington and Lee is certainly
more than coeducation.

Dear Mom and Dad,

Well, I made it through Orientation
Week despite all the deans’ seeming-
ly endless rounds of speeches and
placement tests! This week has been
so hectic I really haven’t had much
time to write. Thanks for all the let-
ters, Mom — I know you miss me and
everything, but don’t you think six
letters and a package is a little ex-
cessive? Did you see my picture in
the paper? Yeah, I was the one in the
lower left hand corner of The Post
stuffing the oversized piece of lettuce
in my mouth in Evans! Sunday after-
noon some photographer made me
pack all my clothes again to take an
“action shot” of me setting up my
room, but I don’t think that one made
USA Today — Buffy down the hall
was in that one with her hair in
curlers!

By the way, what exactly is my tui-
tion for this year? I talked to a girl at
a party the other night and she in-
sisted that W&L was in financial dif-
ficulty and that the only reason the
school went coed is because girls
have to pay more??? I’ve been fol-
lowing your advice so far — but I
haven’t had to use the mace yet. I
think I went to a party on Friday
night, but I’m not sure. It’s amazing
how friendly the guys are around
here — they’re always offering to fill
up your drink for you! Oh, Dad send
me $100 for court costs — on Satur-
day night this nasty policeman ar-
rested me and called me a D.LP.
— which I thought was extremely
rude. I registered for Rush dates the
other day (no, Mom, that’s not a guy
in a hurry), and I’m really looking
forward to meeting some more peo-

Rock music and rebellion, it
seems, have always been synony-
» mous. During the 50s, parents pro-
+ tested that Elvis’ style of dancing
4 was lewd. The Beatles, long hair and
, all, were defamated by the Jerry
~ee Falwell-types of that era. We all
* know of the controversy over “Lucy
, in the Sky with Diamonds” and the

Everly Brothers’ allegedly porno-
‘graphic lyrics to ‘“‘Louie, Louie.”
, ‘Wake up, Little Susie’ was banned

in Boston for suggesting that a girl
“named Susie actually spent the night
+ with a guy, even though the lyrics
, make clear the couple accidentally

drifted off to sleep.
* So, the hoopla that never seems to
, end is now entering Round 436. The

Parents’ Music Resource Center,
‘ founded in part by Tipper Gore, wife
,of Sen. Albert Gore, R-Tenn., and
_ Susan Baker, wife of Treasury Secre-
, tary James A. Baker III, is a group
, that has proposed a ratings system,

much like movie ratings, for the
* music industry. The record industry
,s0 far has agreed to a ‘‘PG’’ rating

that each label would apply to some
‘of its own artists. But the PMRC
, wants an industry-wide system that
includes an “R”’ rating. They also
‘want the most offensive album
covers brown-papered, and the most
offensive lyrics listed on the front, so
| parents know what they are buying
,their children.

I doubt that many parents buy
‘records for their children; either the
,kids buy records with their allowance

or paper route money, or they nag
*Mom for the money and go buy the
yrecords themselves. Most parents

 

»* -» * > &

*

have more important things to con-
=*cern themselves with than their 12
year old’s infatuation with Duran
Duran.
’ Tf such a ratings system were im-
,posed, would there arise an obliga-
tory four-letter word in every song to
ravoid a “‘G’’ rating? The movie pro-
,ducer who makes a ““G’’ movie these
days is committing financial suicide,
} ‘and that producer will therefore

 

 

 

‘Rating rock lyrics
‘wrong, ridiculous

throw in some foul language and a lit-
tle nudity to get the “PG” or “R”
rating.

Another problem arises: How ex-
actly do we rate the music? By song?
By album? By artist? Prince, who is
fast becoming famous for porn-rock,
could be rated an ‘‘X”’ for “Darling
Nikki,”’ about a girl who does lasci-
vious deeds with hotel lobby maga-
zines, or a ‘‘PG”’ for ‘‘Purple Rain,”
a love ballad. Both songs are from
the same album; what should the
album be rated? What about radio
stations? Will there be ‘‘X”’ rated sta-
tions?

Who will set the standards for the
rating system? I’m positive that Mrs.
Baker’s idea of what is passable and
my idea of what is alright are radi-
cally different, and I am outraged at
the idea of someone pushing their
morals off on me. I dare say I’m not
alone in that opinion.

A “restricted’”’ rating on movies
means no one under 17 is admitted
without guardian. One must be 18 to
purchase ‘‘pornographic literature.”’
But how is “restricted music’’ to be
controlied? Once a tape is bought, it’s
gone. It can be easily reproduced and
distributed by ‘‘underage”’ listeners.
Will record shops start carding those
who wish to purchase Madonna’s
latest hit? Will kids be arrested for il-
licitly listening to Motley Crue?

The PMRC should leave the music
industry alone. Things are getting a
little out of hand as far as lyrics go
(who wasn’t at least a little shocked
by Madonna’s performance of ‘‘Like
a Virgin’ at the 1984 MTV awards’).
But as long as there is a market for
“norn-rock,”’ it will be produced. A
rating system will only fan the fire by
calling too much attention to the
lyrics. It might actually increase the
sales of ‘‘porn-rock’’ records. People
are fascinated by the dirt. Publisher
Bob Guccione used the same tactic
with his Vanessa Williams spread,
and sold millions of copies of Pent-
house magazine.

No, the solution doesn’t lie with
rating records (i.e., restricting
sales). The answer lies in parent-
child communication. The parents’
morals, whatever they may be,
should already be instilled in the
child, so that when the time arises,
the child — and not the parent — can
say, ‘‘No, I choose not to listen to this
music.”

Just one more reason
you gotta love Rush

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Executive Editor

 

Back in my little tyke days, I
loved Hot Wheels. My brother
Scott and I used to build quadru-
ple tracks with loop-the-loops and
Lincoln Log villages in the center
of the track. It was a nightmare to
clean up, but kids don’t mind, and
a little Lego never hurt a vacuum
cleaner.

Eventually, though, I got bored
with Hot Wheels. We didn’t get rid
of them; they still sat in the closet
and I’d play with them sort of half-
heartedly when it rained or I was
sick. But I could never get psych-
ed up for those all-day productions
of my Sesame Street years.

A lot of seniors feel the same
way about Rush.

I don’t know if it’s blue blazer on
the brain or termina] grip-and-
grin, but the novelty definitely has
worn off.

Some folks give up smoking for
Lent; Washington and Lee stu-
dents give up academics for Rush
— the only time of year that:

e Otherwise intelligent, in-
teresting people are reduced to
talking about their caffeine
buzzes. ==

¢ No one is too boring for you not
to be suddenly fascinated by his
life story, his class schedule and
his aunt’s cousin’s pets.

e And “‘other houses are doing
it’ becomes adequate rationale
for vivisecting your grandmother. |

The process cuts both ways as
far as intrafraternity relations:
The same guy who’s your “cool
fraternal brother’’ when he
rescues you from some joker
who’s on Act V of the time he ran
out of gas in Trenton, becomes the
devil incarnate when he’s the one
who decides to forego your next
door neighbor for 20 years whose
sister was going to be your Fancy
Dress date.

You quickly discover that some
of the freshmen just don’t have
their Rush patter down very well.
One specimen from southwest
Virginia who came through our
house last year astutely noted
there were “sure a lot of service

projects for an Eagle Scout
around here.’’ (‘‘Excuse me, I
need to refill my drink. May I get
you anything — say, a grip?’’)

It’s the repetitiousness that gets
to you very quickly. I think I'll
lose my mind, for example, if
another freshman says ‘‘I'm try-
ing to cut back’’ when offered a
soft drink. And, no, I don’t want to
hear any more Rock Hudson
jokes.

Of all the idiotic conversations,
though, the all-time hall-of-famer
has got to be: ‘Oh, you’re from
California? Do you know...?”’
(“Oh, you’re from the United
States, too? Do you know...?’’)

I shouldn’t knock it, though,
since I suppose discussing
Heidegger or transcendentalism
over chips and dip would be even
less appealing than explaining
(again) why I came ‘‘all the way
to W&L from L.A.” (I like to
travel, OK?)

Fraternity types all talk about
how bored they are at open
houses, but then refuse to reward
creativity. You’ve got to hand it,
for example, to the Florida fresh-
man who this year went through
Rush wearing a tux jacket, bow
tie and 501s.

Such individuality, however,
rarely prompts rave reviews on
the back of the offender’s name-
iag.
Those comments may range
from ‘“‘good man,”’ “‘bid material’’
or “cool guy’’ down to ‘“‘Clearasil
Poster Child,” ‘should be put to
sleep” or ‘just stopping off at
W&L on his way south for the win-
ter.”

(This year’s new rating system
for waterfowl, courtesy of a Wash-
ington Street fraternity: ‘‘flap
factor.’’)

Every once in a while, though,
there’s a freshman smart enough
to be in the driver’s seat. At a par-
ty Friday night, the ten thousand-
th hand I shook belonged to a guy
who introduced himself as ‘‘Ron.
Ron Reagan.”’

“Ron? Good to know you. ’Prec-
iate your coming by. May I get
youa....”

I realized — too late — that I’d
been had.

Bid him!

Three fraternities fined for Rush violations:

 

By JIM STRADER
News Editor

 

The judicial committee of the Intrafrater-
nity Council last night found three frater-
nities guilty of ‘‘no contact’’ violations and
fined each $150, said IFC President Jaimie
Hayne.

Two of the fraternities, Phi Delta Theta
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon, committed their
violations by throwing a party that freshmen
attended at a house outside of town last
Wednesday night. The third infraction was
committed Tuesday night, when Sigma Nu

had freshmen to its house for dinner and kept
them there too late, Hayne said.

“No contact” regulations limit contact bet-
ween freshmen and fraternities at certain
periods before and during Rush to allow the
freshmen to concentrate on other activities
free of fraternity interference.

This was each house's second violation,
Hayne said. The first violation for Phi Delt
and SAE came after another country party
last Sunday, Hayne said. Sigma Nu was
found guilty of an incident that occurred the
same day, when house members helped
freshmen move into the dormitories. Hayne
said that each house received a warning for

those actions.

Commenting on Rush violations so far this
year, Hayne said: ‘‘I don’t hear about every-
thing, but I hear about most of it.”’

The IFC judicial committee meets when a
fraternity is charged with a violation. It is
made up of the president, vice-president,
secretary and treasurer of the IFC as well as
the two junior justices and the senior justice
of the body.

A new wrinkle in Rush this year is the in-
troduction of women into the mix. Women
were permitted to register for Rush dates at
fraternities Sunday while men signed up for
open houses.

IFC Rush Chairman Sam Svalina released
figures on this year’s registration. He said
278 of the 316 male freshmen, or 90.2 percent,
registered for Rush. In addition, seven up-
perclassmen are listed. Sixty of the 107
female students signed up for Rush dates.

Hayne said he informed the freshmen
women of the new arrangement at the IFC
presentation during orientation week. Only
W&L women are permitted to attend the
Rush dates, and there is a limit of 15 women
per fraternity at each function.

The IFC reasoned that including students
from area women’s colleges might be a bur-
den on the fraternities. ‘“‘We were afraid that

The Ring-tum Phi, September 19, 198

 
   
  
 

if we did that, we’d have no control over the
number of women,”’ Hayne said. ‘If it got out
of hand, it would turn into a party.”’ -
‘‘Rush dates are to allow the rushees to get
to know the actives better,’ Hayne contig.
ued. ‘‘If there were too many women, the
Rush dates would serve no purpose. But we
wanted the women to be involved in as much
of the Rush process as they could. We want to
prevent them from being alienated.”

Hayne said the next regular meeting of the
IFC will be Tuesday. Hayne scheduled it fgr
before the fraternities’ issuing of bids jo
freshmen so he could explain this procedure™
fully to IFC representatives. ‘

A freshman makes his descent from the footbridge

Fourth-year cadet Tony McCann helps a freshman prepare to rappel off the footbridge

30 freshmen get early taste of ROTC

 

By JOEL MILLER
Staff Reporter

*

 

About 30 to 35 freshmen par-
ticipated in Washington and Lee’s
ROTC-sponsored Adventure
Weekend held Sept. 13-15.

Major Michael Cullen of the
Military Science department felt
that ‘‘everyone enjoyed them-
selves and really learned a lot of
survival-based_ skills.’’ The
weekend, which was organized by

third- and fourth-year cadets,
featured a variety of different
military-oriented activities.

Friday afternoon, several fresh-
men hiked along the Appalachian
Trail for eight miles and camped
for the night at Peddler Creek.
Several groups of Special Forces
attachments were stationed along
the trail and they demonstrated
several survival skills. Also dur-
ing the day, several other fresh-
men rappelled down the W&L

footbridge and spent the afternoon
spelunking in a local cave.

Late Saturday morning, 140 peo-
ple gathered for the afternoon pic-
nic and concluded the day by raf-
ting down the James River. The
weekend was completed on Sun-
day with additional rappelling at
Virginia Military Institute and
rafting along the James.

Cullen had good expectations
for the freshmen that attended.
He said that several were ‘‘poten-
tial leaders.”’

 

 

Women’s halls decide on varied visiting hours

 

By JIM STRADER
News Editor

 

Rules regarding visiting hours in
the freshman dorms are another of
the changes in effect this year, and
like the other changes, these also
haven’t affected just freshmen.

“It was the wildest thing I’d ever
done — dropping a girl off at
Graham-Lees and then driving

home,”’ sophomore Will McNair said
this week. ‘‘It was the first time I'd
dropped a girl off at a dorm and not
stayed.”’

All the halls occupied by men
adopted 24-hour visiting hours, ac-
cording to head dormitory counselor
Tom Mack. He added that the
women’s halls elected to abide by
various schedules.

In the new visiting-hour rules, the
hours voted upon are subject to reap-
proval after three weeks, Mack said.

Also, the balloting on each hall’s
rules this year was secret, in order to
prevent any intimidation from other
students during the voting.

Mack said the trial period allows
the freshmen to see how they like the
rules.

“It gives them a chance to exper-
ience visiting hours for a while with-
out their being binding,” he said.

Sydney Marthinson, a dormitory
counselor on a women’s hall, said her
freshmen chose the strictest hours of

any hall. Their ‘‘off-limits” hours are
midnight to 10 a.m. on weekdays,
with ‘‘special provisions” made for
Wednesdays. On weekends, her hall
has 24-hour visitation.

The weekend schedule would suit
some freshmen fine during the week
as well.

Alston Parker, a freshman on Mar-
thinson’s hall, said her proposal dur-
ing last week’s voting called for re-
stricted hours to be 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.
on weekdays.

 

NEWS BRIEFS

“T wouldn't mind 24 hours,” she
said.

“I’m not modest. I wouldn’t care if
someone saw me in a towel,” she con-
tinued. ‘I have two brothers.”’

One counselor said the freshmen on
his and neighboring halls were carry-
ing on last weekend as if there were
no restrictions at all.

“Sunday morning it was like a
z00,”’ he said. ‘“‘There were guys and
girls running up and down the halls
screaming.”

Student charged with drunkenness, brandishing firearm

Mad rush :
for carrels:
subsides ;

By BERT PARKS k
Staff Reporter

 

 

~~

Just a handful of students were
waiting for the doors of the Universj-
ty Library to open Friday morning at
8:30. Their goal — to reserve a study
carrel for use this fall. :

Reference librarian Peggy Hays
said this week that seven or eigit
students lined up to reserve their car-
rels, and that now there are few car-
rels left. ’

“All the carrels may have already
been claimed, but I have not heard
any complaints from students,”’ ske
said. .

However, student response to re-
serving carrels was much higher
than last year, and the library pro-
bably will need more in the future,
she said. '

Carrels are reserved by studen|
simply by leaving personal belong-
ings in them. The student then cah
leave his books there for the school
year and have a handy, 24-hour place
to study. ‘

Rules for reserving carrels haven't
changed from past years. No carrels
were allowed to be reserved until
8:30 Friday morning, in order to
allow upperclassmen to have an }
equal chance of getting a carrel.

 

 
    
  
  
 
   
   
 
 
   

Also, reserving a carrel with a sign
saying ‘“‘Reserved”’ is not allowed.
Hays said students sometimes re-
serve carrels in this way for friends,
and then the friends never come in to
use them.

+

With the limited number of carrels

and the high demand, the library

must get the most use out of the car-
tels as possible, so they may as

students who rarely use their carrelé
to give them up to another student. ,

She said she is conducting a study
of the use patterns of the carrels to
see how many are still unclaimed
and how many of the claimed ones
are actually used.

 

   
   
    
  
 
  
   
 

There are also a number of locked
study rooms available for semestef
use by honors students, seniors write
ing theses and professors. Hays said
these have always been in short supp:
ly and must be requested in advance
Requests are considered on a first-
come, first-served basis. .

Although the lights are turned off
at night to conserve electricity, thé
library is open 24 hours a day during
the school year.

SABU changes name to MSA

The Student Association for Black Unity voted last
night to change its name to the Minority Student Assoc-
iation,

“The acronym ‘SABU’ was looked at in kind of the
wrong way around here,” said President Derrick
Freeman.

He said the group was perceived as isolating itself
from the rest of the community, and that the words
“black unity’’ often were seen as unity against the rest
of the campus. Freeman said he would like the group to
be seen as striving for ‘‘community unity.”

“We're trying to become a more community-oriented
organization,”’ he said.

The name change reflects that, Freeman said, in that
the term minority is meant to mean not just blacks, but

women and other minority groups on campus.

“We're trying to get rid of that image of a black
hangout,”’ he said.

The group is planning to sponsor events for blacks
and the whole community this year.

Student convicted of theft

A Washington and Lee student was convicted this
summer on a charge of credit card theft. He and three
others were arrested in May on charges of illegal use of
another student’s telephone credit card.

The charges were brought last year after then-sopho-
more David Shugart reported the loss of an AT&T Call-
ing Card to police.

Walter J. Hopkins Jr., of Kingwood, Texas, was found
guilty of being an accessory after the fact to credit card
theft and received a 30-day suspended sentence. A
charge of credit card fraud against him was dropped.

Felton E. May of Hummelstown, Pa., who was charg-
ed with two counts of credit card fraud and one felony
count of credit card theft, will go to court on Nov. 15 to
defend his felony charge.

Senior Bryan K. Johnson, of Jersey City, N.J., had
charges of accessory to credit card theft and credit
card fraud dropped.

Junior Calvin Rankin was found not guilty of being an
accessory after the fact to credit card theft, and the
charge of credit card fraud was dropped

In other recent police actions:

¢ A pair of black stereo speakers was taken Tuesday
from the car of sophomore Roger Hildreth. Hildreth’s

1966 Mustang was parked in front of the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity house when the speakers reportedly were
taken.

* An Alpine stereo amplifier valued at $85 was report-
ed taken Monday from the 1976 Datsun of Christopher
Cilis, 19, while it was parked at 105 White Street.

¢ A Panasonic cassette player was removed from the
car of third-year law student Gregory Duncan while it
was parked in the Law School parking lot. The player
was reportec missing sometime on Friday night or Sat-
urday morning and was valued at $80.

¢ The Louisiana license plate was taken sometime
yesterday from the 1981 Buick of Catherine Hardy, a
Hollins College student.

Delta Tau Delta awards money

The Delta Tau Delta fraternity recently awarded its
second Chris Larson scholarship to freshman Anthony
Waskiewicz.

The scholarship is awarded based on character, as
judged by the members of Delta Tau Delta, and this
year involves a $100 gift certificate to purchase books at
the Washington and Lee Bookstore.

Law elections held yesterday

First-year law students Chris O’Brien and Kemp Kas-
ling will represent their class as president and vice
president, respectively. The two were elected in first-

year law elections yesterday.

Both will serve on the Student Bar Association, and
O’Brien will be a member of the Student Control Com-
mittee.

Elections for the first-year law representative to the
Executive Committee will be held in a couple of weeks,
according to Julie Gregory, chairman of the SBA.

Plante to delay graduation

Dormitory Counselor Kathleen Plante has decided
not to graduate this year, eliminating the possibility
that this year’s graduation will be W&L’s first coeduca-
tional commencement.

Plante said she is uncertain whether she’ll graduate
in December or June of the 1986-87 academic year.

STU pays Centel $8,000

Students returning to school last week have paid
more than $1,200 in overdue telephone bills to the Stu-
dent Telephone Union, but that hasn’t offset the check
for nearly $5,000 that STU paid this week to Centel to
cover students’ delinquent bills.

Chairman Tom O’Brien said STU has paid Centel a
total of $8,851.24 in students’ overdue bills since
January

STU had a table set up in the matriculation line to col-
lect overdue bills from students. The students’ excuses

ranged from lackadaisical roommates to forgetfulness,
according to O’Brien.

lufyve a brand new house in time for

i Alumni Director Richard B. Ses-

‘‘A year from now I’m hoping there

Entrepreneurs
get good response

with new group

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
News Editor

 

When junior Marquis Smith read a
Wall Street Journal article April 4 on
an “up-and-coming” national club
for student entrepreneurs, he im-
mediately was interested in begin-
ning a chapter at Washington and
Lee. Smith talked over the idea of a
new organization for young business-
men with junior Joe Jefferis and
senior Curt Mehorter, and the three
soon established W&L as a certified
chapter of the Association of Col-
legiate Entrepreneurs.

What Jefferis, Mehorter and Smith
did not foresee, they say, is the ex-
cited response of students all over
campus.

“We've been getting a lot of feed-
back about ACE just walking around
campus,” Smith said. ‘‘We think this
will be one of the strongest chapters
in America.”

According to Jefferis, one student
was especially interested in ACE
since he was considering ordering
shirts from the Far East to sell for a
profit.

One of the main purposes of the
organization, he said, is to make
available to student entrepreneurs
resources and information that may
not be available in any other way.

With the help of a microcomputer
and a modem — a device that acts as
a translator on the telephone — a
young entrepreneur can use normal
phone lines to tap information from
the ACE Electronic Network. Ser-
vices include access to electronic
mail, bulletin boards, a newsletter,
human networking and skills ex-
change, surveying, conferencing,
cataloguing and purchasing of more
than 70,000 consumer items.

W&L students were first introduc-
ed to ACE during matriculation,
when Jefferis, Mehorter and Smith
collected the names of nearly 140 in-
terested students.

Although Smith confessed that he
expected the chapter to grow to a
maximum of 20 students this year,
Jefferis said it is now ‘‘a mushroom
effect we're trying to create here.”’

On the other hand, Smith said,
“We're not here to waste time.”’

“Our goal for this year ... is to get
as many people out to Los Angeles
for ACE’s third annual conference
Feb. 20-23,” he said, noting that those
dates coincide with the University’s
winter break. The conference is an
opportunity for young entrepreneurs
to buy and sell franchises and share
thoughts, ideas and business cards.

Besides the national conference,
Jefferis, Mehorter and Smith have
plans to create a student agency and
workshop to educate entrepreneurs
about resources available to them.

“The whole purpose is networking
your ideas,”’ Smith said. He explain-
ed that the workshop will allow stu-
dents to exchange views concerning
a variety of literature dealing with
business.

The chapter’s first meeting will be
Oct. 21, when an as-yet-unselected
local entrepreneur will serve as
guest speaker.

Jefferis said membership in the
association is a great opportunity for
making contacts in the business
world. He suggested that corpora-
tions may be more likely to hire an
individual who has shown his motiva-
tion to succeed by joining an organi-
zation like ACE.

“They’ve got some of the brightest
students in the country working with
ACE,”’ Smith said.

Starting with seven member col-
leges in 1983, the non-profit organiza-
tion has since spread to 170 chapters
in the United States, Canada and sev-
eral other countries.

“‘T couldn’t believe something like
this wasn’t already here,’ Mehorter
said.

To aid in the group’s success, the
three have asked administration Pro-
fessor Lawrence M. Lamont to act as
adviser.

The three then sold boxer shorts in
the matriculation line to generate
revenue for the chapter’s expansion.
Selling 90 pairs of boxers at $1.50
each, the three generated $135 to be
used for organizing the Oct. 21 meet-
ing.

Rise in interest surprises W&L’s political organizations

‘Washington and Lee students had
totun the gauntlet of campus organi-
zafions when they went through the
matriculation line last week.

But even with all the organizations
vying for the attention of students,
two of them managed to attract the
interest of more than 450 students.

Those two groups are the College
Republicans and Young Democrats,

ally have been the largest student or-
ganization on campus, but the group
still saw an increase in interest this
year.

At the table in the matriculation
line, 365 students signed up, an in-
crease of 115 students from last year,
according to Chairman John Pnesec.

For the Young Democrats, 82 peo-
ple signed up, an increase of 45 from

last year. That increase included
more interest from upperclassmen,

according to President Everett Ham-
ilton.

Pensec was surprised at such a
jump in interest in a year with no ma-
jor national elections. Last year’s
presidential race between Ronald
Reagan and Walter Mondale spurred

voter interest. This increase may~
signal renewed political activism in
students, Pensec said.

“We were real pleased with the
number of people who showed inter-
est,” Pensec said.

However, both organizations
realize that the number of people
signing up does not mean that many
people will show up at the meetings.

Hamilton said the Young Demo-
crats have been contacted directly by
one candidate asking for help, and
they plan to work for the other Demo-
cratic candidates as well.

Both organizations will be doing
similar work, such as polling Lexing-
ton citizens and manning phone lines
and distributing literature to drum
up support for their candidates.

As for special campus events, both
clubs have plans in the works.

The Young Democrats have sched-
uled Congressman Jim Olin of the 6th
District to speak Tuesday at 7 p.m. in
the University Center.

The College Republicans have no
speakers definitely scheduled, but
they plan to have someone on cam-
pus before the end of the school year.

Hamilton and Pensec also express-
ed a willingness to work together dur-
ing the coming year. Some of the

ideas they have tossed around in the

past include a friendly softball game,
a cookout, or some type of communi-

has been decided.

Despite the willingness to co-
operate, no love is lost between the
two groups.

At matriculation, the Young Demo-
crats displayed an advertisement
against coeducation that the College
Republicans placed in The Phi in the
spring of 1984.

Although many of the women
thought the advertisement was a bad
mark against the College Republi-
cans, they felt that their political
benefits lay more along a conser-
vative line.

Hamilton said he displayed the
advertisement in retaliation to others
taken out by the College Republicans
that made fun of the Democratic Par-

Pensec said he was not a member
of his group’s Executive Board when
the ad was published; so he could not
explain the Board’s decision.

“At the time,” he added, ‘‘every-
one was against coeducation.”’

Pensec said he couldn’t speak for

Crowded dormitory rooms ,—"

spark freshman complaints

 

By JOHN PIPKIN
Staff Reporter

 

Some freshmen have complained
that they are living in crowded condi-
tions in double rooms designed to be
single rooms, and Dean of Freshmen
H. Robert Huntley says the situation
was caused by the increased number
of freshmen this year compared with
last year

There were over 400 freshmen in
this year’s class, 40 to 50 more than in
yrevious years.

To accommodate the large class,
many single rooms in the freshman
jormitories had to be converted into
jouble rooms. As a result, there area

large number of freshmen who are
using a fold-down desk and a portable
closet.

Huntley said that coeducation at-
tracted more applicants and caused
more freshmen who were offered ad-
mission to accept.

The alterations in some of the dor-
mitories didn’t reduce any living
space, Huntley said, so coeducation
was only an indirect cause of the
crowded rooms.

Huntley said he has told the dor-
mitory counselors to do what they
can to make the cramped freshmen
more comfortable. Students are be-
ing allowed additional freedom in
rearranging their rooms.

Although little can be done about
the crowding this year, a new dor-

 

 

 

 

mitory being planned for occupancy
in the fall of 1987 will increase hous-
ing for upperclassmen. It will house
250 upperclassmen in 90 single rooms
and 80 double rooms grouped
together in suites.

The new facility is intended to meet
the needs of the growing student
body, women who may prefer not to
live off campus, and the 100 to 150
male students who have indicated
that they would prefer to continue liv-
ing on campus as upperclassmen.

Assistant to the President Frank A.
Parsons said the project is on
schedule and that construction
should begin in January. The build-
ing will be located on the corner of
Washington and Nelson streets and
will cost an estimated $8 million.

nary structure is unlikely to be
changed in the short-term.

“T don’t think they’re going to do
anything about the system” as a
whole, Hayden said. ‘They want to
try it for three years.”’

Junior Representative Shayam
Menon was among those singling out
for criticism the provision making
the ‘‘use of racial, ethnic, religious or
sexual slurs” a major offense.

“It’s really ridiculous — that’s
what it is,”’ he said.

Shifting to another matter, sopho-
more representative Pat Schaefer
objected to the requirement that
dorm counselors notify the dean’s of-
fice of possession of beer by fresh-
men younger than the legal drinking
age.

Schaefer said that creates “a very
dangerous situation’ in which dorm
counselors and freshmen “‘are pitted
against each other.”’

 

Lewis, in his second year as dorm
counselor, agreed.

“It’s impossible to do academic
counseling when you turned him in
the night before for having beer on
the hall,”’ he said. ‘“‘He’s not going to
trust you and he’s not going to listen
to you.”

Junior Representative Baltzer Le-
Jeune raised the point that the book-
store is not allowing students to
charge books to their parents without
presenting the new bookstore ‘‘credit
cards.”

Bookstore Manager Helena W.
Roller confirmed the card is required
in order to charge purchases.

“Can I ask the members of the
committee what ever happened to
this book?’’ Lewis asked, theatrically
displaying a copy of the Honor Sys-
tem White Book.

‘Does Mrs. Roller know anything
about our Honor System?” he con-
tinued. “I think this is very bad. I
can’t imagine that a man’s — a per-
son’s — word is not going to be taken
at this university.”

Menon echoed his concern. ‘‘We

can’t let [the Honor System] slip,’’ he
said. “It’s slipping now with all these
ridiculous changes.”

Secretary Mike Webb, though,
pointed out that the bookstore had
been having trouble with bills being
sent to incorrect people, and that the
cards were an attempt to eliminate
the errors.

“It hasn’t anything to do with
honor,” Roller said Tuesday. ‘‘Isn’t
anybody sympathetic to my plight?”’

The change came, she explained,
because of longer charge numbers
required by the University computer,

She said errors inevitably creep if
the information is given verbally.
‘“‘What are we supposed to do about
that but get hearing aids?” she asked
in frustration.

Roller also pointed out that the
fallibility of students’ memories
sometimes results in a lot of hemm-
ing and hawing at at the counter as
they try to conjure up their number.

Roller added she knows of no other
University bookstore that allows
students to charge home “at all.”’

includes the Army Reserve
and Army National
Guard — requires getting the
right kind of management
and leadership training.

What's the best way to

. get it? By enrolling in

America’s largest manage-
ment training program-
Army ROTC.

In the Army ROTC
4-year program, you'll
acquire discipline of mind
and spirit, and the ability
to perform under pressure.
We call it learning what
it takes to lead.

It'll pay off, too. First,
during your last two years of
college, when you'll start
receiving up to $1,000 a year.

And, most of all, on
graduation day, when you
receive a commission along

eBeck’se

With all the fine German quality
this name implies, this beer was pro-
bably the biggest let-down of the
night. When poured, it was a good
looking beer with a strong yeasty
smell that both of us liked. But the
first taste was a real disappointment.
Although it was a smooth beer, it also
lacked h.eavily in any distinct taste.

Chris — 4.2; Jamie — 5.5.

*Coorse

Chris and I both liked the look of
this beer, with a nice golden color
and a good smell. We liked the taste
but had a lot of trouble pinning down
exactly why. It had a sharp taste on
the tongue with your first sip, and we
found it to have a rather dry taste.
One thing for sure, we both thought
that it was inferior to beer No. 1
(Lite) and showed that in our slightly
lower ratings.

Chris — 4.9; Jamie — 4.9.

Guiness Stout warm)¢

Our bartender, Misty, suggested
that we include one cold bottle of
Guiness Stout and one warm one, so
we readily complied. Of course, since
this was the only warm beer we were
drinking, we knew what it was, but
we were still very impressed.
Guiness is a very dark beer, with a
robust look and highly alcoholic
smell. Surprisingly, Guiness tasted
great warm because there was so
much flavor (and alcohol, we may
add) that it didn’t need to be cold to
help wash it down. We suggest you do
not try chugging or playing any beer
games with this beer, because the

The Ring-tum Phi, September 19, 1985, Page 7

results could be regrettable. As an
after-dinner drink, though, this
would be tops. Very enjoyable and
filling.

Chris — 7; Jamie — 7.7

*Michelob Darke

This was the other dark beer in our
survey and it had its pros and cons
Mich Dark was a good looking beer,
but it had none of the strong smell of
Guiness. It also had none of the flavor
of Guiness. We came to the basic con-
clusion that Mich Dark was very lit-
tle more than Michelob with food col-
oring. Yet, Chris and I both found this
to be a very enjoyable beer. It had a
very dry, smooth and drinkable
flavor that we both liked. A good
beer, but do not let the ‘‘Dark”’ on the
label fool you. As Chris said, ‘‘For
neophytes only; leave the big stuff to
the heavy hitters.”’

Chris — 6.6; Jamie — 6.3

*Busche

Chris imediately called this a
“dead head’’ because of the total lack
of any head. It looked almost like
watered down ginger-ale and as we
soon found out, tasted like it also. The
only reason I gave it any sort of de-
cent rating was because I figured it
would be an excellent party beer
when you didn’t care what you were
drinking. A “rapid-fire” beer, meant
for chugging, beer-bongs and throw-

ing on fellow party-goers.
Chris — 3.8; Jamie — 4.5.
eHeinekene

This beer caused a lot of disagree-
ment. Chris thought it was a superior
tasting beer, while I didn’t like the
sharp taste it brought to my mouth.
When told what it was later, I was
certainly surprised to find that I had
disliked the taste so much.

Chris — 7.4; Jamie — 5.3.

 

*Bass Alee This was simply an
excellent beer. It had a nice brown
color, and a good head and smell to it.
The taste was the best of both worlds,
with a lot of taste that made a very
distinctive beer but also very drink-
able and smooth. A good beer for just
about any purpose.

Chris -— 7.1; Jamie — 7.9.

Guiness Stout (cold)«

It was surprising how the cold
Guiness did not taste much different
from the warm stuff. Chris decided to
back away from a high rating on
Guiness because of the near in-
timidating flavor of this beer. ‘This
beer puts me in my place,’’ Chris
said.

Chris — 5.2; Jamie — 7.8

But the most interesting results oc-
curred when Chris and I added in our
BPB (buzz per buck) formula. We
decided to divide the numerical
ratings by the price of that particular
bottle of beer, and the results were
amazing. The higher the BPB score,
the better for the beer, because that
would mean low price and good taste.
The results of the BPB factor were as
follows:

Miller Lite: Jamie6.5 Chris-4.3

Foster’s: Jamie-5.8  Chris-6.7

Budweiser: Jamie-7.5 Chris 6.3

Beck’s: Jamie-5.8 Chris-4.4

Coors: Jamie-7.4 Chris-7.4

Guiness (warm): Jamie-
6.4 Chris-5.8

Mich, Dark: Jamie-8.8 Chris-8.4

Busch: Jamie-7.7_ Chris-6.5

Heineken: Jamie-5.8 Chris-8.1

Bass: Jamie6.9 Chris-6.2

Guin.(cold): Jamie4.5 Chris-4.3

So with the buzz per buck factored
in, Michelob Dark was the clear win
ner with a good compromise of taste
and decent price.

or of the court, and called it ‘‘an or-
chestration to try to influence the
court.”

He also mentioned several letters
written to Honts after Girard’s plea
but before sentencing. He said neith-
er he nor law enforcement officers
received copies and suggested Mann
might have done better to call the
people who wrote the letters to testify
in court.

Mann added that he didn’t intro-

Mann explained that he was asked
to speak to the freshman class during

that it was suggested by Sheriff S. M.

freshmen as well about his exper-
iences.

Mann said that he thought that was
a good idea. ‘‘It’s logical to ask him
to speak,”’ he said. ‘‘He’s a student.”’

Two of the letters contained in the

Freshmen H. Robert Huntley and
head football coach Gary R. Fallon.

Huntley’s letter referred to

tion, it was the single most effective
presentation I’ve ever witnessed in
Lee Chapel,’’ Huntley wrote. He con-
tinued that it showed the freshmen
“the real and immediate disaster
they court in dabbling with drugs.”

When asked about Read’s assertion
that he skirted the proper procedure
in arranging to have Girard speak

replied that since no’plea agreement
was made in the trial, it v
necessary to receive the approval of
Read’s office in the case.

Mann added that it was on Rey-

leased from custody.

In past cases involving W&L stu

made with Read’s office for a defen-
dant to attend classes in exchange for
aplea agreement.

When one attempts to name the
‘winner of an athletic event, he must
take home-field advantage as one of
his primary criteria. Yesterday, the
‘Washington and Lee soccer Generals
‘made the prognosticator’s job easy.
Playing for the first time ever on the

perfectly clear that future adjust-

~ ments to their playing accomoda-
tions would be few and far between.

: early in the first half and at 25:55,

W&L never let up. The Generals’ per-
sistence paid huge dividends in the
form of two goals in 30 seconds
Freshman Johnny Sarber, with an
assist from junior Tom Myers, and
junior Peter Van Son each connected
to make the score 3-0 in favor of
W&L.

Van Son must have been thrilled to
score his first goal of 1985, because he
added another with just under four
minutes left in the half to put the
Generals ahead 4-0 as the teams ex-
ited for the intermission

Shenandoah opened the second half
with possession of the ball. But
despite quickly breaking through the
W&L defense, they could not score.

Assuming a ‘‘no more Mr. Nice
Guy”’ position, W&L worked the ball
and the clock to meet its personal
wishes. Among those wishes appar-
ently was another goal. Senior co-
captain Bill Holmes quickly acted on
those wishes by blasting a 20-yard
left footer that easily found the back
of the Shenandoah net.

Holmes’ goal signaled the end of
the day for the General starters as
W&L head coach Rolf Piranian went
to his reserves for the rest of the
afternoon.

Fallon confident
despite 30-0 loss

 

By DAVID EMRICH
Staff Reporter

 

Last Saturday’s season opening
loss to Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference rival Emory and Henry
didn’t seem to bode well for the rest
of the season. After all, following 30-0
losses there usually aren't many
Washington and Lee supporters leav-
ing the stadium with smiling faces.

However, according to W&L head
coach Gary Fallon, there were many
promising signs — hardly what one
would expect from a man whose
team was so soundly defeated.

‘But perhaps the biggest reason
behind Fallon’s good humor is that
the injured Kevin Weaver was exam-
ined by the doctors and given appro-
val to play next Saturday against
Centre. Fallon said this would allow
them to run the more complicated of-
fense and would most definitely help
the team.

W&L entered the game without the
services of projected starting
tailback Weaver who had to sit out
due to a new injury. Weaver’s ab-
sence forced Fallon to alter the
salanced W&L attack by utilizing a
iufry-up offense to try to rattle the
&L defenders. This ploy appeared
o be working as W&L moved the ball
ve}l early

Unfortunately for the Generals,
our miscues opened the floodgates
or‘the Wasps.

The first, a fumble on the Emory
nd Henry 40, killed an effective
rive, while the second, an intercep-
ion with the Generals at the E&H 26-
ard line, was returned 75 yards for a
yuchdown to put W&L down 7-0 ear-

4

W&L attempted to mount a come-
ack, but mistakes again kept them
ut of the game. This time the Wasps
rored after a blocked punt gave
em possession on the Generals’ 5-
aid line. E&H's Sandy Rogers, who
‘sored two touchdowns and rushed
r over 100 yards on the day, scored
1a 5-yardrun to put E&H up 14-0.

In the second quarter W&L
iarterback Jon Thornton was sack-

and fumbled on his own 1-yard
ie. The Wasps again capitalized,
oring on another short run to post a

) halftime lead.

After the Wasps scored on a second
lf drive, W&L committed its final

mistake, snapping the ball over the
head of punter B.J. Sturgill and into
the end zone for a safety.

Why, then, was Coach Fallon so
happy? “I liked the way the team
played. They never gave up,’’ Fallon
said. ‘Even though they were down
30 points, they played like the score
was 7-7. If you had walked into the
ball game late and didn’t see the
score you would have thought that it
was a close game from the way our
guys played. I was very proud of

and freshman Michael Drusano.
Sophomore Chris Gareis and fresh-
man Sheldon Clark combined for the
shutout in the General goal.

W&L closed out its scoring with
second-half goals from sophomore
Charles Lyle and a second tally from
freshman Sarber.

Piranian seemed satisfied with his
team’s play, saying, ‘It took a while
to get going, but we’re where we
want to be right now.”’

If he means Smith Field, he may be
right.

On Saturday the Generals will play
host to the Royals of Eastern Men-
nonite College, an Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference match that both
teams anxiously await.

The Royals, coming off a dismal
3-11-1, fourth-place finish last year,
are hoping to rebound from last
Saturday’s 1-0 loss to Averett.

Center forward Phil Landes and
midfielder Gary Meyers lead the
Eastern Mennonite attack. They are
supported by six fellow returning
starters. Coach Byron Shenk is op-
timistic about his goalkeepers, whom
he describes as ‘good communica-
tors.”

However, communication is only
one aspect of the Royals’ game plan.
Scoring goals is another, and accord-

ing to Shenk, this year’s major con-

cern. Last year’s team was shut out

11 times, a statistic which caused

Shenk to place his emphasis on of-

fense in this year’s pre-season. Con-

sequently, he feels that the Royals

“should be stronger’ in the oppo-
nent’s end of the field in 1985.

The Generals, under the tutelage of
10th-year head coach Rolf Piranian,
have installed a new system which
enables them to utilize all 11 men on
the field. This game plan will keep
teams from marking a particular
General player, Piranian said. The
ll-man attack also should make in-
dividual fatigue less of a factor, ac-
cording to the W&L head coach.

Piranian sees the Royals as a tough
defensive team year in and year out,
and he expects no reason for a
change this year. He’s hoping to keep
his players as fresh as possible
because he knows that this will be a
tight, high pressure ballgame.
“We're going to have to do a lot of
running,” the coach said. And run
was exactly what they did last year,
when the Generals prevailed 3-2 in
overtime.

Last year’s dramatics should carry
over into Saturday’s contest, so much
so that, according to Piranian, ‘‘Jim-
my the Greek would pick this to be a
tight match.”

Polo overcomes itself to get second place

 

By LEIF UELAND
Staff Reporter

 

Winning three of its five matches,
the Washington and Lee water polo
team finished second to Richmond in
W&L’s Fall Classic last weekend.

The team’s performance showed
its ability to play impressive polo. It
also illustrated the inconsistency of
an inexperienced group.

After handling Lynchburg, 36-2, in
their opener, the Generals suffered a
surprising defeat in their second
match to Johns Hopkins, 11-10. The
team came back with victories over
Dayton, 12-8, and the University of
Arkansas at Little Rock, 21-8.

ly the most important
match for the Generals was the loss
to Johns Hopkins, a team W&L look-
ed likely to beat soundly.

“The Johns Hopkins loss occurred
because we made some mistakes
that are common with a young
team,”’ Remillard said.

“It was one of those early season
problems that I do not expect to see
later in the year.”

The loss to Johns Hopkins pulled
the rug out from under the confident
W&L team, and with three tough
matches remaining the Generals had
no time to lose in getting back up on
their feet.

“Everybody was just devastated
[by the loss], but we did a great job
coming back,” said sophomore
Simon Perez.

In their victories against Arkansas
and Dayton the Generals were on top
of their game, looking confident in a
challenging situation.

“Arkansas and Dayton are good
teams and I think they were an in-

dication of the way we can play,”
Remillard said.

In the championship game, W&L
was dominated by the University of
Richmond, the No. 18 team in the na-
tion.

‘“‘We are a better team than last
year, but they’re no worse. They
made us make mistakes. They’re
mistakes that we can correct. And I
assume the responsibility for correc-
ting those mistakes,” said coach
Remillard.

 

them. I don’t measure success by
wins and losses, I measure it by that
type of thing.”’

Fallon did cite some bright spots
for the Generals during the E&H
game. ‘‘We didn’t pass or run as well
as we could have, but I was very im-
pressed with the job Chris Coffland
did.”’

Coffland started in place of the in-
jured Weaver, gaining 116 yards in
total offense.

Due to a scheduling problem with
Dickinson, the football team now has
an open date with no game planned
for Saturday. Coach Fallon thinks the
time off will help the team.

‘We had a tough pre-season, and
then the tough game with Emory and
Henry. The time off will allow us to
regroup,” he said indicating that
while the players will have next
Saturday off, ‘We'll start working
just as if we had played on the
previous day.”’

Fallon said W&L will work on
sharpening pass patterns and im-
proving its running game in the days
leading up to next Saturday’s game
with Centre College.

tailback that we could use. This
prevented us from using our more
complicated offensive formations
and we're going to work on that this
week,”’ Fallon said.

Fallon said the extra time between
games also will be used to review
game films and prepare a game plan.
The W&L kicking game which gave
up three points in the E&H loss, will
also be a focus, Fallon said.

‘“‘But basically,” he said, ‘‘we’re
going to work on our passing and run-
ning so we don’t repeat the mistakes
we made on Saturday.

“It will be close. We hope to win

Remillard.

Brown’s pool is Olympic-size with
no shallow end, which the team feels

We are working hard, it should pay

TIME OUT/Mike Stachura

Let’s not go
to the tape

...Officiating. The issue's been talked to death: perhaps ever since
that demon technology invented the instant replay, and one more talk-
ing isn’t going to make a bit of difference, but here’s a new idea: Let's
not use anything but the six gentlemen we already have scurrying
around the field.

But wait, you say. The USFL used the joy of videotape last season,
occasionally. The NFL also was lured by the apparent charms of the
second-look factor. So much so in fact, that Pete ‘The Pup” Rozelle is
talking about using cameras as officials come playoff time. These
video machines are going to give you a better angle than six men scur-
rying around the field, you say. These six scurrying men, you say,
have been missing calls left and right, And not just missing calls, you
say, but missing calls that are game-maker calls.

Boy, you say a lot.

But all of it is true. And still we don’t need the TV camera. The addi-
tion of the TV judge, a name quite fitting for the new official, would
be much the example of too many cooks spoiling the batter, if not
changing the entire recipe.

The game is fine as it is, but it can only get worse with the addition of
TV. The logistical problems inherent in adopting the camera as
an extra official are only an initial step toward real confusing pro-
blems. For example, there are the delays involved in deciding that
maybe they should look at the tape for this play. And what if the
camera doesn’t catch the play from this angle? Or when do you decide
to use Supercalafrajolistic Slo-Mo to get a better idea of how the play
really turned out? Meanwhile, what do we get to do while a bunch of
bozos deliberate for 20 or 30 minutes on whether or not Mark Duper
had both feet in bounds?

If the video camera replaces the official, can we be far from changes
in the game like running pass patterns designed to provide for difficult
camera angles? Officials will become lax in their duties. (‘‘Oh, the
camera will catch our mistakes.’’)

The instant replay is a technical mess. But what's more is that it is
not a uniform part of the game. The cameras would not be used at
Washington and Lee nor at Lexington High School. But would anyone
dispute the fact that at the core, both the game played in Lexington
and the game played in Dallas are the same?

And Pete the Pup’s talk about just using the camera in the playoffs
is patently absurd. What makes these games more important than
those played the week before?

Football is football. Its bi-annual rule changes have done little than
clutter the game. Let’s make better officials. Let’s not continue to clut-

 

 

....Colonnade-wise, here’s what’s doing: They’ve got a good idea
geared up for lunch every Tuesday in Evans Dining Hall. The in-
season coaches will host a ‘‘General-Lee Speaking” kind of get-
together that will include video demonstrations and ‘‘week in review”
presentations by the coaches. A leisurely way to spend lunch while at
the same time showing a little bit of appreciation for the work the W&L
athletes and coaches put in. Make it a point to be there...I think it
would be best for all if we forgot about last Saturday afternoon in
Emory. What we can remember, however, is the water polo team’s
weekend in Lexington. They might lave lost a couple, but somehow
you know that this week’s appearance in the finals is merely a taste of
good things to come...Good to see the soccer team get off to a good
start. A reminder that their home games are up on the field in front of
Liberty Hall...

.... Noticed the other day that a U.S.-Soviet sports pact had been sign-
ed. A what? Sad is the day that we start having ‘‘political” agreements
determine athletic practices. The agreement doesn’t even guarantee
both countries will show up for the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics. Some

....And finally, a personal note to Gerry Faust: Hope the new home
you reportedly are building fn South Bend has wheels underneath it....

Want to exchange play calling
strategies with Washington and Lee
head football coach Gary Fallon?

Anyone, including W&L students,
faculty and administrators, may at-
tend the weekly ‘‘General-Lee”
Speaking Sports Luncheon on Tues-
days at noon in Evans Dining Hall’s
side dining room.

The Athletic Department hosted
the first luncheon this past Tuesday.
Those who wish to attend may bring
their own lunch or purchase an “‘All
You Can Eat” lunch at the. Dining
Hall for $3.35.

Head lacrosse coach Dennis Daly,
who is also responsible for Athletic
Department promotions, organized
the program. Daly said that the pro-
gram is designed to bring the coach-
es, faculty and students together.
Hosting these luncheons, Daly plans
to illustrate to the W&L community
that the University’s athletic pro-
grams are only extra-curricular ac-
tivities and not high pressure, class-
time consuming athletic programs
that some other schools have.

President Wilson attended Tues-
day’s meeting and hopes that the
meetings would ‘help increase the
interest in supporting Washington
and Lee athletics.” He also supports
the luncheons because they give the
faculty, coaches, and students a rare
opportunity to meet together and
discuss the University’s athletic pro-
grams.

Each week, the coaches whose
teams are in-season will discuss
strategies, players and schedules.
Also, each meeting will feature video

tape highlights of a current W&L
sport.

The inaugural ‘‘General-Lee”’
luncheon featured highlights from
the Washington and Lee football
team’s season opener against Emory
and Henry last weekend.

During the highlights, faculty
members asked Coach Fallon about
specific plays and players. For ex-
ample, one guest asked about Emory
and Henry’s Old Dominion Athletic
Conference outlook. Fallon replied,
“I’ve got to think that E&H is the
team to beat.’’ He also said that
Randolph-Macon and Hampden-Syd-
ney would contend strongly for the
ODAC title.

Coach Daly opened Tuesday’s
lunch describing the program’s pur-
pose and introducing the ‘‘in-season’”’
coaches. He also mentioned that
future luncheons may feature some
of the University’s outstanding
athletes.

Head soccer coach Rolf Piranian
then reported on his new team, its
strengths and weaknesses, and its
opening game against Shenandoah.

Following Piranian, head water
polo coach Page Remillard discussed
his team’s second-place finish at last
weekend’s W&L Fall Classic. He also
described his use of video tape to help
him coach his team. Fallon then con-
cluded the program with his high-
light presentation.

Coach Daly said that he was very
pleased with the first meeting’s at-
tendance and results.

Daly has scheduled ‘‘General-Lee”’
Speaking luncheons for each Tues-
day on the W&L academic calendar.
Next week, the program will feature
soccer highlights. The Oct. 1 lunch-
eon will feature water polo.

W&L-VMI Golf Invitational set for weekend

 

By REED HOWLETT
Staff Reporter

 

This weekend the Washington and
Lee student body, as well as the en-
tire Lexington community, will be
treated to some of the finest col-
legiate golf in the area, as the 7th An-
nual W&L-VMI Invitational Golf
Tournament is held on Friday and
Saturday at the Lexington Golf and

Country Club.

Eighteen teams will be participat-
ing in what Coach Buck Leslie calls
“one of the best fall tournaments in
the Mid-Atlantic region.’’ Two Divi-
sion I golf teams, Old Dominion and
William and Mary, will be included in
the field.

Leslie looks for senior captain
Greg Wheeler, sophomore Gary
Camal, sophomore Chip Gist, junior
Mark Zavatsky, and sophomore John

Gammage to play the Generals into
an upper-half finish in the invita-
tional.

Across the way at VMI, head coach
John Swink speaks of the strength of
the field: ‘“‘Teams such as James
Madison and Virginia Common-
wealth play in many prestigious tour-
naments all year round.’’ Swink
would not venture to predict how the
Keydets will fare, but he looks to h.is
strongest golfer, Robert Nussy, and

two more lettermen to lead VMI.

The tournament will begin this
Thursday, when the course opens for
practice rounds. Practice will give
way to actual play on Friday and
Saturday with tee times starting at 9
a.m. from both the first and tenth
tees.

One thing is for sure, no matter
who wins the tournament, there will
be some excellent golf played this
weekend right here in Lexington.

W&L women:
an artsy look

ARTREVIEW

By BOB STRICKLAND
Art Critic

 

 

This year’s opening exhibit at the
duPont Gallery is an appropriate
way to initiate Washington and Lee
into the realm of coeducation. Is
coeducation here to stay? Indeed. In
fact, the University has had quite a
collection of women who have helped
the school develop into a mature in-
stitution.

‘‘Women At Washington and Lee:
A Historical Exhibit’ is just that.
Although it includes art, the portraits
themselves are not the focal point of
the exhibition; rather, it is the
women who have contributed both
their time and money to better the
University who make for the
historical nature of this exhibit. The
exhibit will run until Oct. 3

In the entrance of the gallery is a
miniature bed and doll made by
Mary A.R. Custis Lee, wife of Robert
E. Lee, who was an active seam-
stress in the community while Lee
was president of the University. She
would give these doll house beds as
Christmas presents to neighborhood
children. This bed is a fine example
of Southern folk art of that time.

Above the bed is a photograph of
Mary Custis Lee, daughter of Robert
E. Lee. She was responsible for
donating many portraits of the
Custis-Lee family to the University.
These portraits can be viewed in the
museum below Lee Chapel. A world
traveler, Mary Custis Lee made
beautiful books of her journeys that
can be viewed in the University
Library’s Special Collections room.

Another extraordinary lady associ-
ated with Washington and Lee was
Louise Herreshoff, who married

Summer
MUSICNOTES

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Music Critic

 

 

The record industry, to put it light-
ly, boomed this summer. It seemed
as if every important act released a
record and it also seemed that every
person with $8 in his pocket plopped it
down for one of these hot platters.
Maybe it was because the movies
were so pitiful or perhaps Live Aid
caused this upsurge, but nonetheless,
people were buying a lot of records.

Sitting at the top of the old industry
charts is Dire Straits. And who would
have thought it? Dire Straits de-
serves to be as big as, say ‘‘Thriller,’’
but that sure doesn’t guarantee
platinum success.

Anyway, ‘Brothers In Arms’”’ is a
wonderfully exquisite record that is a

Euchlin D. Reeves, an alumnus of the
law school. The couple collected
Chinese Export porcelain and even-
tually donated all of their collection
to the University, where it is housed
in the Reeves Center. While the col-
lection was being organized, a large
amount of dusty paintings were
found among the porcelain. It was
discovered that Louise Herreshoff
was quite an accomplished artist in
her younger years. ‘‘Self Portrait
With Parrot”’ (c. 1918) is a classic ex-
ample of her Fauvist-inspired work,
which she turned to after her earlier
work with a casual Post-Impression-
ist style. In her earlier ‘‘Le Repos”’
(1899) Herreshoff demonstrates her
ability to mimic the Impressionist
style advocated by the great art
school in France where she studied in
her youth.

A lively, lyrical portrait that usual-
ly hangs in Washington Hall portrays
one of the University’s great ladies,
Ruth Parmly. In 1974 she gave a
large sum of money to strengthen the
science program at the school. The
science building was later renamed
Parmly Hall. Oddly enough, she had
no connection with the school; she
gave to W&L because she thought
this institution embodied the same
moral attributes as those of her late
father. The portrait is a fine example
of the smoky, lyrical impressionist
style which was used by many por-
trait artists of the time.

Two interesting pieces in the
gallery are the photographs of two
women during the early years of
Fancy Dress Ball. One of the women
is ‘Annie Jo’’ White, the University
librarian at the turn of the century
and the celebrated founder of Fancy
Dress. She never missed a Fancy
Dress Ball until her death. A portrait
of her that usually hangs in the
library is also on display.

 

 

Two of the most renowned benefac-
tors of the University today are
Sidney and Frances Lewis of Rich-
mond. Lewis Hall was built along
with the Law Center with their
generous gift. In the exhibit is a large
portrait of the couple done by the
renowned photorealist Jack Beal.
The Lewises have one of the most
comprehensive collections of con-
temporary art in the country and
much of the art hanging in Lewis Hall
was made possible by their generosi-
ty.

The woman who donated the gift to
make the University art gallery
possible and the building in which it

is housed was Jessie Ball du Pont.
During her association with the
University, she gave over $7 million.
Her place in the school’s history is
even more significant because in 1959
she was the first woman elected to
the Board of Trustees.

Another woman associated with
the University is artist Sally Mann, a
photographer and native of Lex-
ington. After graduating from
Hollins College, Mann became the
University photographer from
1974-80. Her work is included in the
collections of the Museum of Modern
Art and the Hirshhorn.

Box office hit ‘Back
to the Future’ not :
to be overlooked |

MOVIEREVIEW

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

 

Some movies seem destined for
box office success. ‘Back to the
Future,’ directed by Robert
Zemeckis (“‘Romancing the Stone’’),
produced by Steven Spielberg, and
Starring Michael J. Fox of TV’s
“Family Ties,” is just such a movie,
and deservedly so.

Fox plays Marty McFly, a high
school senior in 1985 who spends his
spare time riding his skateboard,
playing his guitar, and helping local
mad scientist Dr. Emet Brown
(Christopher Lloyd of TV’s ‘‘Taxi’’)
with his experiments.

It is while working on one of
Brown's projects that Marty is ac-
cidentally sent 30 years into the past
in a time machine made from a De
Lorean sports car. Once in 1955,
however, he inadvertantly prevents
his parents’ first meeting and must
try to get them back together before
he fades from existence. (If his
parents never meet, of course, he will
never be born. )

Getting his parents together is
much more complicated than he’d
hoped, though, because instead of
falling in love with his father, his
mother starts to go after him

Fox is the perfect choice as Marty;
he is likable, honest, and a funny
physical actor, much more suited to
this role than the man he replaced,

of ’85 heats up the record industry

welcome breath of fresh air. It cer-
tainly is not the Straits’ best (check
“Love Over Gold’’), but there is no
denying its power. Beautifully pro-
duced, chock full of powerful songs,
and laced with Mark Knopfler’s
beautiful guitar work — the record
simply glistens with craftsmanship.
Repeated listenings bestow great
rewards, as well, since Knopfler’s
songs (lyrically, at least) work on
several levels. Is ‘‘The Man’s Too
Strong” an allegory of the Catholic
Church going to confession or a Nazi
vignette? A powerful record indeed.

R.E.M.’s ‘Fables Of the Recon-
struction’ did nothing for me at first.
It plodded and dragged without that
eccentric edge that characterized
their earlier work. However, it even-
tually clicks. The surreal dissonance
of “Feeling Gravity’s Pull,’ the
jaunty country crunch of ‘‘Driver 8”

and the giddy rockabilly/funk of
“Can't Get There From Here”’ slide
under one’s skin and stick. Now, if so-
meone can only tell me what these
songs are about.

Crawling from the funeral ashes of
Joy Division, New Order has been
trying to shake that group’s gloomy
shadow for five years now. With
“Low-life,”’ they finally did it. Sure,
some of the songs are about death
and rejection, but the music is beau-
tifully layered and intricately craft-
ed. It’s kind of like dancing in a
refrigerator. If you are one of those
types who thinks that syntho-dance
music is passionless (as I did), then
get rid of that prejudice. This record
has every bit as much emotional in-
tensity as a Black Flag album.

If New Order doesn’t exactly sound
like a ton of fun, then check out the
Talking Heads’ ‘‘Little Creatures.”

SG&L making the smooth
transition from SG&G days

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Editor

 

What’s ina name?

Many spectators may have asked
that question of themselves as they
sat in the Washington and Lee stu-
dent tavern to watch the first band of
the pub’s 1985-86 entertainment year,
Not only were they adjusting to the
pub’s name change from The Cockpit
to The General Headquarters, but
they were getting used to a new name
that marks a change for a familiar
band.

Speidel, Goodrich and Lille made
their Lexington debut last Friday
night, and fans of Speidel, Goodrich
and Goggin certainly learned that
change can sometimes be for the bet-
ter.

Now some of you out there might
be just a wee bit confused keeping
track of all these names, so let’s try
to clear up the picture just a bit.

Let’s go back to the spring of 1983,
to a sleepy little college town called
Charlottesville, home of everyone’s
favorite orange-and-blue-tinted
public institution of higher learning.
More specifically, let’s go to one of its
student hangouts — a place called
Pavilion XI.

If one happened by Pavilion XI at
the right time, one might have seen
three young men entertaining the
local crowd with acoustic guitars.
Two of those young men, Tom Good-
rich and Mike Goggin, were seniors
at the University of Virginia and the
other, Rusty Speidel, had graduated
the year before.

The three of them had been playing
around the Charlottesville area in-
dividually and decided to get
together and do a few numbers. The
manager of Pavilion XI offered the

young men an opportunity to play
there on a regular basis.

Speidel, Goodrich and Goggin was
born.

Of course, every real band needs a
manager and for SG&G it turned out
to be John Livermore, Goodrich’s
roommate, ‘‘They were always keep-
ing me up with their practicing, so I
told them they better give me a job,”
Livermore remembered.

From those faint beginnings, the
band began to develop what Liver-
more called a ‘‘fantastic following”’
among local students. The group got
its first shot outside the Charlot-
tesville area at Phillip’s Waterside in
Norfolk, where Livermore said the
band members really were able to
hone their skills as musicians.

Things have been picking up ever
since, Last year SG&G expanded its
touring area as far north as Balti-
more and as far south as Tampa.
Livermore added that the band had
also been nominated ‘“‘most pro-
mising new act’ in a competition
held by the National Association of
Campus Activities. Two years ago
the national winner was the Police,
and Livermore remains realistic
about his group’s chances.

“We may not win, but at least
we're in the same category as groups
like that,” he said.

While things were going well for
SG&G, they still weren’t well enough
to prevent Mike Goggin from making
the decision to leave the group last
spring to move on to law school. The
decision almost put an end to the
musical careers of the other
members.

‘We thought at first that it might
be the end,’’ remembered Liver
more. *‘We were just about ready to
call it quits.”’

In fact, if it had not been for Mike

Lille, they would have all called it
quits. ‘“‘Mike was absolutely the only
person in the world we could think of
as a replacement,’’ Livermore said.
“If we couldn’t have gotten him, we
would have quit.”’

Lille had met up with SG&G at
Phillips Waterside while playing solo
around his Tidewater area home.
Lille has been playing professionally
for more than 10 years, having
played with members of the Dirt
Band and even an occasional im-
promptu session with Dan Fogelberg
while living in Aspen.

The transition from SG&G has
been a smooth one. “I miss him
{Goggin] terribly,’ Goodrich said,
‘because he was such a good friend.”

‘But we’ve been incredibly lucky
to keep going. Mike Lille is talented
beyond our wildest dreams and
we've created a lot of new challenges
for ourselves.”’

Challenge is a very appropriate
word. The band spent six non-stop
weeks practicing, getting Lille used
to some of the old standard SG&G
favorites plus adding to the group’s
overall repertoire.

Livermore said that Speidel and
Goodrich learned anywhere from 30
to 40 newsongs, bringing the group’s
total to well over a hundred.

While SG&L are well known for
their acoustic guitar playing, the
group is not limited to just playing
“mellow’’ music. ‘‘We play almost
anything from James Taylor to Dire
Straits,’’ Livermore said.

“We play pretty much whatever
we like to,’ he added. ‘‘Most of all the
songs we play came from an album
in one of our collections. That leaves
us open to play just about anything.”

Livermore said that most of the
songs are hammered out by the band
members completely by ear. ‘‘They

The sound is clean and stripped down
and the songs are punchy, thought
provoking, and just plain fun. I listen-
ed to ‘Road To Nowhere’ every
morning last summer on my way to
work and it made my day a bit easier
to bear. A woman floats over her
neighborhood in one song and a little
boy plays with his baby brother in
another. In a nutshell, the album
sounds exactly like the record sleeve
looks.

Sting’s ‘Dream of the Blue Tur-
tles’”’ simply left me cold. Every note
is oh-so-pretty, the playing is im-
maculate, and the songs are all well
written. But who cares? Sting’s best
songs are the ones with the hooks and
the ones that are drawn from his per-
sonal life (in that order). Only “‘Rus-
sians,’’ with its surging string syn-
thesizer and lullaby/protest lyrics,
really moved me. The rest of it was

just ... well, very nice. Buy it on com-
pact dise because the produotion is
the star here.

As for Tears for Fears, well they
just kind of strike me as Wham!
meets Genesis. They seem like
another video-pop package, only this
time with a gimmick; psychiatric
dance music. For instance, ‘‘Shout”
is a song about parenthood with
primal scream therapy as its meta-
phor. Not exactly “Wake Me Up Be-
fore You Go-Go,” but these British
popsters still fall short of that ma-
jestic sophistication of the Simple
Minds.

This is only the tip of the iceberg,
though. With new records from the
Clash, John Cougar Mellencamp and
X waiting in the wings, the record in-
dustry just might become a forum for
artistic expression again. But |
wouldn't hold my breath.

Marty must adjust to his new sur-

Indeed, to catch every subtlety”
here, one has to see the movie three+

never read any music,” he said.”’ |
think Rusty might have had one gui-
tar lesson about 12 years ago. But
they can whip up a song in no time.”

Along with its normal touring
schedule, Livermore said the band is
in the midst of working on a six-song
EP. ‘We're really excited about this
project,’’ he said. ‘‘We're going to be
trying some new things.”’

One of the new things the band will
be experimenting with is the addition

of bass and drums to the sound of the
accoustic guitars.

“Half the EP will be with the whole
band and half will be with just the
three acoustics, ‘according to Liver
more,

Steve Riggs, who played bass for

the All-stars, will be helping them out
along with Mike Clark, the drummer
for the Charlottesville-based The
Deal

While Livermore said it is impor
tant to try new things, he added the
band will not be sacrificing the
acoustic guitar format that has
become its trademark.

Livermore said they hope to have
the EP completed sometime between
December and February. ‘‘We have
to squeeze the recording work around
the touring schedule,”’ he said. ‘‘We
like to work more on it, but we also
like to eat, and that requires doing
shows

With a successful transition, an
album in the works and a full touring

schedule, things look fairly stable for
SG&L. .

‘Right now I feel | can concentrate «
my energies on my music,”’ Goodrich
said. ‘This is the perfect time for me *
to take this chance. I’m young, play-
ing musi¢ and singing and making a
living out of it. The fact that people "
come to see us is really important.”’

Goodrich added that while they like
playing the college circuit, there still
is that desire to make it big.

“Yeah, we want to be big stars!” .
he joked

‘We would be remiss not to want to
Succeed,’’ he added more seriously
“We want to try to get a major record
contract and give that a shot and just
see where we go from there.”’
