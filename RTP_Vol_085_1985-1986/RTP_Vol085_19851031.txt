National attention will be focus-
ed on Virginia Tuesday as the
elextorate devides a gubernatorial
race with implications for the
country’s political parties and as
voters determine the fate of the
first biack and woman nominated

for statewide office.
Despite the potential impact of
the races’ outcomes, Larry

Sabato of the University of Vir-
ginia, widely viewed as the state’s
leading political analyst, said last
week in Staunton that the guber-
natorial clash is ‘the dullest cam-

 

paign I can really remember.”

Indeed, it may be hard to im-
press a state in which the gover-
nor’s wife is the daughter of
former president Lyndon B. John-
son and in which actress
Elizabeth Taylor campaigned for
and is the former wife of one of the
senators. (‘‘Liz-less,” The Wash-
ington Post dubbed the current
campaign in September. )

The race for governor is a
rematch of the 1981 contest for at-
torney general, in which Demo-
crat Gerald L. Baliles edged Re-
publican Wyatt B. Durrette by 51
percent to 49 percent. Baliles, 45,
this summer resigned to cam-
paign; Durrette, 47, is a Rich-

mond lawyer.

The differences between the
candidates’ positions on issues
are, in Durrette’s words, ‘“‘more
like a river” than the ‘“‘gulf”’ that
usually separates the two parties
in statewide races.

Even the British weekly The
Economist picked up on the same-
ness theme, headlining a report
this month on the Baliles-Durrette
faceoff, ‘‘T'weedledum and
(yawn) Tweedledee.”’

A Baliles victory would be a
boost for outgoing Governor Char-
les S. Robb, who was featured by
The New York Times in an April
article as one of ‘‘the rising stars
of Democratic politics.’’

Trustees take
no action on

SCC’s

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Mews Editor

 

 

The Campus Life Committee of the
Board of Trustees last weekend dis-
cussed the new disciplinary policy
but took no action on it, according to
an administrator.

The policy, passed by the faculty
last spring, came under fire this fall
from the Student Body Executive
Committee, with President John B.
Lewis saying at the year’s first
meeting that ‘‘the whole system is
very un-W&L.”’

Among its provisions is a clause.
classifying certain racial, ethnic,
religious and sexual slurs as major
disciplinary offenses. Certain mari-
juana sales are minor offenses.

“There may have been some indi-
vidual trustees who had opinions, but
the committee took no action,” said
Dean of Students Lewis G. John, who
attended the Campus Life meeting.
“Tf anybody were to take action, it
would be the faculty.’

Lewis, who also attended the meet-
ing, said ‘there was concern that
racial and ethnic slurs could be con-

’ sidered a major offense while drug

trafficking could not.”

J. Thomas Touchton of Tampa,
Fla., the committee’s chairman, de-
clined comment on the meeting.

Barometer: Country will watch Virginia on Election Day

Robb, who by state law cannot
run for re-election, is a possible
opponent for Republican Senator
Paul S. Trible in 1988. Robb has
begun playing an increasingly vis-
ible role in the national Democra-
tic Party, including the chairman-
ship of the Democratic Gover-
nors’ Conference.

On the other hand, such a
Baliles win inevitably would be
viewed as a setback for President
Reagan. White House Chief of
Staff Donald T. Regan has said
the Virginia race is a ‘‘test of the
ongoing realignment” in Ameri-
can politics and that a Durrette
loss could ‘slow down or brake’’
that shift.

University President John D.
Wilson said there is some ‘‘distorted
thinking” about the policy among
students.

“T think we live with some hypocri-
sy around here,”’ he said. ‘‘ ‘I am a
gentleman except on Friday night
and Wednesday night.’ ”

In other trustee action, the sub-
committee on apartheid formed at
the board’s May meeting met with a
group of students opposing Universi-
ty business interests in South Africa,
Wilson said.

The committee gave an interim re-
port this weekend and plans a full
report in February.

On Friday afternoon, the director
of the University’s East Asian Stu-
dies program, associate history pro-
fessor Roger B. Jeans, reviewed the
program for the Academic Affairs
Committee, which conducts a study
of one area of academic life at most
meetings of the board.

In the last four years, it has studied
romance languages, the English de-
partment and the history depart-
ment.

Jeans said the committee did not
realize the scope of the East Asian
Studies program before hearing the
report. ‘‘It’s like taking one slice of
the tissue and putting it under the

Planning a date
with your parents

 

By PAUL DAVEY
Social Critic

 

This weekend marks the continua-
tion of a long-standing college tradi-
tion — Parents’ Weekend. After
showing your parents that you have,
indeed, managed to transform your
room into one suitable to be in ‘‘Ar-
chitectural Digest,” taking them to
your fraternity to down a few with
the brothers, and watching the
Generals’ football game, you will no
doubt be asked, ‘‘Well, son (or
daughter), what else is there to do
around here?’’ In order that you do
not appear to have failed in absorb-
ing your environment, it is wise to
know of a few ‘‘different’’ things to
do.

If you want to stay close to school,
you might wish to visit the Robert E.
Lee Chapel and Museum. The muse-
um is very interesting even if you
are from the North and don’t recog-
nize all of the Confederate Generals
in the prints. The Lee family crypt,
Lee’s office as he left it, and
Traveller's grave are also special
points of interest. The Chapel and
Museum are open from 9 a.m. to 4
p.m. Monday through Saturday and 2

school, city get ready for parents

Busy schedule planned for 1,100

 

By DANA BOLDEN
Staff Reporter

 

This weekend will be the chance for
parents to experience what ‘their
children experience all year long, as
Washington and Lee holds its 31st an-
nual Parents’ Weekend

The weekend includes several open
houses by various departments on
campus and is highlighted by Satur-
day’s football game against Bridge-
water College and the University
Theatre’s rendition of William
Shakespeare’s ‘‘Merchant of Ve-
nice.’’ The activities start at 10 a.m.
tomorrow and continue through Sun-
day afternoon.

The weekend was organized by
W&L’s Development Office, but the
ideas for activities came from the
different departments on campus

“We are expecting about 1,100
parents this weekend.”’ say Carter
McNeese, associate director of devel-
opment.

Activities include open houses
sponsored by the journalism depart-
ment, the language laboratory, and
the campus observatory of the roof of
Howe Hall. The music department
will offer a concert in Lee Chapel
featuring the W&L Brass and Percus-
sion Ensemble, Glee Club, Chorus,
and Southern Comfort at 8 p.m. Fri-
day evening.

At 9 p.m. President and Mrs. John

D. Wilson will host a Parents’ Recep
tion in Evans Dining Hall.

In addition to more open houses
Saturday morning, parents are in-
vited to participate in seminars with
members of the University’s faculty,
administration, and student leaders.
Following the seminars, President
Wilson will deliver his annual report
to parents in Lee Chapel at 11:30 a.m

A pre-game Octoberfest luncheon
will be served from 12:15 to 1:15
Saturday on the new alumni field
before the football game against
Bridgewater at 1:30. The cost for
lunch will be $6.50 for adults and free
for children under 10. Students on the
meal plan eat free

‘The Merchant of Venice” curtain
times are Friday at 3 p.m. and Satur
day at 8 p.m. Reservations are re
quired for these performances.

On Sunday the Reeves Center will
host an open house from 10 a.m. until
noon,

There seems to be only one ap
parent problem with the crowd of in
coming parents, and that is parking

‘Parking is always a major pro-
blem, not only with parents, but
students as well,’’ McNeese said
‘There is only one thing we can do to
prevent this — ask students to leave
their cars elsewhere.”

McNeese said the University
schedules Parents’ Weekend late in

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, October 31, 1985

 

Hi, Mom!

It is Parents’ Weekend.

The leaves are raked for the first time all fall. The ivy has
been trimmed from the window sills and paint patch-ups
have long since dried. Those cute little signs welcoming
parents to campus seem to sprout from the lawn.

Friday night, the coed University Chorus for the first time
will share the billing with the all-male Glee Club and the
Brass and Percussion Ensemble in the traditional concert
that will command standing room only.

The best part — and the part that many parents and stu-
dents will look forward to the most — is President Wilson’s
address to any and all souls who congregate in Lee Chapel
around 10 or 11 a.m. He, like past presidents of the Universi-
ty, will try to issue pleasant platitudes, playing the best
public relations professional he can.

There are a few things I hope he tells parents: that ‘‘the
women’’ are now ‘‘fellow students’; that the tuition next
year will probably increase; that the Honor System, on the
whole, is working, though it needs serious repairs here and
there; that the biggest hassle during the coeducational tran-
sition has been keeping visiting women out of the coeds’ (and
not the men’s) showers; and that he, alas, has purchased a

weekend retreat in the county.

But those thoughts will probably go unspoken, and not nec-
essarily out of any deliberate attempt by President Wilson to
mislead parents. Parents’ Weekend hardly seems the time to
discuss substantial issues. Parents are here to see the child
who is growing up, and though they have to face the bills and
the midterm report cards, the concern they hold this week-
end is not for the health of a University or the well-being of
coeducation. There has been plenty of time for that.

 

MY VIEW

By Nelson
Patterson

 

Nearly one year ago, Scott
Tilley wrote a column wondering
what each student would take
away from college. He used as his
focus a surprising response a
faculty member gave him when
Scott asked if it would hurt his
grade in the course if he missed
the week prior to Thanksgiving to
go with friends to Bermuda.

‘‘Will missing a week of school
affect where you are 10 years
from now?” the psychology pro-
fessor asked Tilley.

His response was ‘‘no” and the
professor urged him to ‘‘go for it,”’
since that is what ‘‘college is for.”

That week in Bermuda was one
of the best weeks in his life, Scott
told me later. He was glad he had
taken the risk, and not because
the weather was great (though it
was) or that the mopeds exper-
ienced new speeds under his con-
trol. Scott enjoyed the week in
Bermuda because he was with
friends, developing relationships
that would last long past the end of
the term.

This past Saturday, one of the
friends with whom Scott spent his
week in Bermuda died of cancer.
His death was not unexpected,
though many hoped that it would
not come so soon or that God, in a
true test of His powers, would
spare John for some greater
work. But that was not to be the
case, for reasons I cannot well
understand at this time.

I remembered Scott's column
this past weekend as I sat at
home, wondering what had hap-
pened to my friend. Scott has
warned against developing tunnel
vision, “‘seeing what is going on
here and only here,’’ worrying
about me and only me. Scott over-
came the “should I take the A-
minus or B-plus” dilemma by
deciding that developing a close
relationship with a few friends
mattered more in the long run

—NRP

——EE——————

Taking more than a
diploma from college

than the pretty grades on his
report card.

“Take time to develop friend-
ships. Guard those friendships
well. Let them be nurtured,”’ Scott
inferred. In taking the time to en-
joy John Coe last November, Scott
reaped a harvest of memories.
John knew that God’s way of
developing men strong in the faith
and close to the Spirit meant
developing a dependent relation-
ship with a younger fellow, en-
couraging him in his search for a
God and a godly life that all too
often seem elusive, or simply not
present. In this case, Scott and
others who met John benefited. It
is a process known as
“discipleship,” and it began long
before John Coe or Scott Tilley
began to suscribe to it.

For that reason, John Coe’s
death does not seem half as tragic
as it appears. It is always griev-
vous when a young life is extin-
guished, but in John’s case, a
legacy of concern for others and a
cadre of ‘‘disciples and disci-
plers” stands ready in his wake.
His hard work at building lasting
friendships that reproduce them-
selves paid off, just as it always
does and will. John Coe knew that
what we take away from college is
far more than a diploma or book
knowledge; it encompasses more
than nice memories of fraternity
brothers or parties or memorable
encounters down the road; and it
certainly includes more than we
can sum up in trite expressions.

Developing a growing relation-
ship is an education in itself, a
sharing and a teaching that only
matures when the two partners
extend the friendship ring by in-
cluding two more people. Like Joe
Namath and his Faberge sham-
poo commercial, then two friends
tell two friends...and the process
continues. Lenin once claimed
that with a few dedicated men he .
could turn the world upside down.

- John Coe proved Lenin right, in a

perverted sort of way.

After thinking about Scott’s col-
umn and trying to remember the
lunches I had with John Coe, I
guess I knew what I wanted to
take away from Washington and
Lee. I only hope as a senior I
haven't lost too much time.

Did ‘coolness’ kill the Honor System?

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Executive Editor

 

The student recruitment guide
squiring a high schooler and his
mother, around the Colonnade five
summers ago proudly noted that dur-
ing the school year, calculators,
jackets and wallets routinely are left
unattended in the library.

That sounded impressive if a bit
suspicious to the boy from California,
where when you go to the library you
take one of your bike tires inside with
you.

Twelve months later as an incom-
ing freshman, he received in the mail
several pamphlets with a ‘‘Do not do
this” theme: Lying, cheating, steal-
ing and plagiarizing, it seems, were
big, big no-nos.

The whole deal sounded more like
simple good manners than anything
as lofty as “honor,” but the
guidelines certainly seemed ad-
mirable and straightforward.

Shortly after arriving in Lexington,
the freshman had an experience that
played a key part in how he viewed
his upcoming quadrennium on the

Colonnade.

After an Honor System orientation
in Lee Chapel, the freshmen were
divided into small discussion groups.
The student and perhaps a dozen of
his classmates went over to a class-
room for their close encounter with
an Executive Committee member.

This stud was Mr. Honor: H@was
articulate, forceful, convincing
—don’t mess with me, I won’t mess
with you, thank you for listening. He
asked for questions and no one said a
word, Impressed? You'd think they’d
just seen Robert E. Lee himself.

All that, though, was a long time
ago. It was before the student
became vaguely aware that someone
in his fraternity absconded with
some house alcohol left out after a
party. It was before he realized there
are pockets of open discussion about
“hot’’ tests. And it was before he was

- ripped off in an untraceable way by

someone close to him.

Such disillusionment inevitably
follows the honor ecstasy endemic to
those new at Washington and Lee.

An Executive Committee member
recalls that at his first meeting after
he was elected several years ago, he

Ex-EC rep sees honor
ideas mixed, muddled

To the Editors:

I submit for general consideration
the following thoughts:

¢ The authority newly given to the
Student Control Committee to deter-
mine whether behavioral aberrations
warrant dismissal from the Universi-
ty provides a long-needed means for
distinguishing and reviewing conduct
that does not fall within the scope of
Executive Committee review. Past
ECs have agonized over how to treat
intolerable behavior presetting no
clear question of trustworthiness.
The options have been to shoehorn
the issue into one of trustworthiness,
frequently through extremely atten-
uated reasoning, or to allow the issue
to fade away unaddressed.

e The idea that the new system infr-
inges on EC/Honor turf is grounded
in a misconception. The Honor Sys-
tem applies only to matters of trust.
More specifically, the system must
only be invoked on cases whose cen-
tral issue is an alleged lack of trust-
worthiness on the part of the accus-
ed. For a student to be expelled from
the University under the Honor
System, the EC must find it appropri-
ate to say to the accused: ‘‘You have
violated the trust your fellow stu-
dents had in you such that the integri-
ty and good faith of all your future
acts within the University communi-
ty would be suspect.’’

e¢ A number of students seem to

‘believe that the concepts of honor
and of acceptable behavior merge
under standards manifested in the
behavior and thoughts of General
Lee. They should read an account of
Lee’s unconscionable actions regard-
ing the treatment of wounded troops
during the battle of Cold Harbor,
June 1864, and then reconsider

whether that near canonization is ac-
tually warranted. With all due defer-
ence to General Lee's extraordi-
narily fine character, he was human
and therefore subject to human frail-
ties. He was particularly subject, as
is every human, to the frailties com-
mon to his times. The Executive and
Student Control committees should
work in tune with their own times and
borrow from the past only where
there is genuine merit in doing so.
Nineteenth century values have
substantial relevance to matters of
trust, the concept of trust having a
relatively unmalleable nature, but
are relevant on only an elementary
level to issies of socially acceptable
behavior.

e That the non-honor disciplinary
procedures at Washington and Lee,
including the sanction of dismissal,
are student-administered adds tre-
mendous weight to the impression of
respect given the student body by the
trustees and faculty. This new devel-
opment (ignoring the unfounded
codification scheme) can be held out
to prospective students along with
the student-run honor system as one
of the major strengths of the Univer-
Sity.

* Class officers now play a mater-
ial role in imposing serious sanc-
tions. Their elections must now en-
compass considerations other than
the ability to put on great parties.
And perhaps the chair of the Student
Control Committee should be an
elected position, not an appointed
one.

Sincerely,

Jim Vines

EC representative, ’80-81

wondered aloud why they needed
people to man the polling places for
an election. He now says somewhat
sheepishly that it wasn’t long before
nd found out what the “‘real world”’ is
ike.

One of the most conscientious EC
members confesses to the same
private uncertainities that haunt all
students who realize the system may
not work perfectly. ‘‘I feel like the
priest who doubts there’s a God,” he
says.

Despite such inevitable misgiv-
ings, most of Washington and Lee’s
best and brightest remain zealous
devotees of the Honor System.

Those same hard-core, Mr. Wash-
ington and Lee types, though, were
almost universally opposed to coedu-
cation. The Board of Trustees said
they were wrong — that their vision
of Washington and Lee was flawed
and outdated.

And many of those guys now con-
cede privately that the trustees were
right.

The troubling question: What,
then, does that say about our Honor
System? Is it, too, a vestige of a
Washington and Lee gone by?

More questions, equally disoncer-
ting: Is the Honor System a charade
we preserve for ourselves? Do we
deceive ourselves about the system’s

While Ms. Kothman might have a
point in her article about the ‘Great
Halftime Departure” [Oct. 24], I’m
not ‘‘as sick as the next guy’’ when it
comes to hearing about W&L tradi-
tion.

Tradition has nothing to do with
students leaving the game at half-
time; that’s a matter of choice. I’m
sorry, Ms. Kothman, but maybe you
haven’t been here to experience the
real traditions at W&L: the legacy of
Robert E. Lee, the student-run honor
system and the fine rapport between
students and professors. That’s what
W&L tradition is all about.

A friend observed the other day
that at Washington and Lee, we no

here, so we don’t. But it’s not ‘‘cool”’
to turn in a buddy or fraternity

Traditions exceed exodus

By

classes I attend, but rather a person ~~
with whom they can converse both —

academically and casually.

Ms. Kothman, if every student
were as sick as you about hearing
about W&L tradition (incidentally, I

believe they are not), then I believe —

it’s time for the admissions office in
Washington Hall to close its doors.
I’m not sick and tired of hearing
about tradition; I’m sick of people
like you who take it for granted.

GREAT TAX REFORM

of 19 million people hope to survive
with the Great Panda breathing hos-
tility right down its neck? It’s all in
attitude — as Julius Rosenwald once
said — ‘turning lemons into
lemonade.” Through an insatiable
appetite for learning, production and
advaneement, the Chinese people
have turned what was once a back-
ward territory of the Japanese em-
pire into a powerful economic force.

But we've heard that before; the
entire Asian seaboard is bustling
with freighters carrying products to
trade in Western markets. What
makes Taiwan different and worth
reading about?

It’s really a combination of two
things: one, the unique heritage and
customs of the Chinese, and two,
their eagerness to adapt and emulate
Western advancements. Since these
are essentially two topics, I will only
focus on the former.

I can never forget the question a
man posed to me in Mandarin one
evening: ‘“‘“Excuse me. How much did
the hair cost?’’ Apparently he’d
never had the opportunity to tell a
foreigner how strange he looked.
There is a certain arrogance about
from claims to cultural superiority.
Once asked what he thought of

SURE,

Western culture, a Confucian scholar
said, “I think it would be a good
idea.”’

This incident with the rude man
took place in the Leng Shan district,
in “Snake Alley.’’ It's a rather seedy
place — not the place to take Biff and
Cindy when it isn’t a school night.

Right away the flashing colors and
din of intoxicated people suggest this
is something only worth visiting.
Long rows of suspended balloons
span the night sky, and underneath
one can witness the slaughter of a
live cobra or watch a VHS movie of
pit bull terrier fights.

After the snakes are forced to draw
venom for aphrodisiacs, which by the
way I never saw anyone consume,
the skins are collected and attrac-
tively hung on metal hooks. In addi-
tion to the snake meat available
everywhere, freshly caught oyster,
squid and shrimp are steaming in
open air cafes. It’s a sharp contrast
to an otherwise conservative and
upstanding country, but I thought I
would start you there.

The cuisine of the island reflects
the variations in the Chinese them-
selves. My favorite style is Szech-
wan, which is always spicy and us-
ually mixed with the staple diet, rice.

hes

Z
Y

 

 

One particularly good place served
“tanstsu paigu,’’ or sweet and sour
pork. Baked fresh flounder stuffed
with hot peppers was even more tan-
talizing.

Another part of the Chinese diet is
Cantonese food, whicl: features such
dishes as stewed beancurd, pigs tripe
with salt vegetable soup and roast
duck rice.

And finally, there is the good time
of a Mongolian barbecque. Each cus-
tomer selects the combination of
meats, vegetables and sauces he
desires and hands it to a chef, who
fires it on giant griddles with a pair of
chopsticks.

Of course, ‘‘Taiwan Beer”’ is avail-
able everywhere due to the lack of a
drinking age, and we put down
enough to compare it to Busch: about
the same.

Most of the food is produced do-
mestically; a belt of rice fields, re-
flecting the Asian sun with knee-deep
water, loops down the western side of
the island.

True to the stereotype, Chinese
peasants spend hundreds of hours
barefoot planting rice by hand, their
only protection from the sun being
the traditional ‘‘douli” hat.

From the rooftop of the Fu Ren
Language Center, I could see a
modern cement factory belch smoke
into the atmosphere, and at the same
time see peasants bent low over their
work in a rice paddy. It was a little
thought-provoking.

At summer’s end, my two Ameri-
can friends and I had the opportunity
to travel by bus to Kenting at the
southern tip of Taiwan. From start to
finish, we had to use spoken Man-
darin to order food, find lodgings,
buy return tickets and even to rent
bicycles.

The beaches were often made of
lava rock, especially around the
lighthouse on the southern tip. In this
spot, I stood on a wooden veranda
and looked over the vast Pacific
Ocean, the only person visible being
asentry at his post 300 feet below.

The sand beaches were not too
crowded — in fact, I’d say deserted,
which made us wonder what the
Chinese do for fun. On another beach
trip, most of them sat fully clothed
under umbrellas.

Formosa has transformed itself in-
to a place of radical diversity. In the
industrial cities, among the most
populated in the world, the accom-
plishments are tremendous; in the
mountains and surrounding regions,
the Chinese lead more peaceful and
secure lives.

Access

Girard assists with
handicap project

By JIM STRADER
News Editor

 

“IT made a mistake .... It’s had its
negative effects already, and I’ve
turned it into something positive and
learned from it.”

With those words, Washington and
Lee senior Gene Girard summarized
his conviction on a cocaine charge
and his current involvement with a
community service project now un-
derway in Lexington.

For the past two weeks, Girard has
been working with architect Lee
Merrill of Commonwealth Design on
the ACCESS project, an effort to
evaluate downtown Lexington’s ac-
cessibility to handicapped people.
Girard, currently serving six months
of a five-year jail sentence for co-
caine possession, is participating in
the project as part of a work-release
program of the Rockbridge County
Jail.

A partially completed, pencil-
drawn map of Lexington is taped to
an inclined desk in the office where
Girard works. Each building is
drawn to meticulous scale, as are
items such as sign and light poles,
curbs and sidewalks. Girard’s AC-
CESS responsibilities include taking
actual measurements around Lex-
ington and charting the location of
certain potential obstacles.

“TI basically go out and do all the
fieldwork and do what I’ve done,”’ he
explained, pointing to the map. “‘Lex-
ington doesn’t have a map like this

—it has never been done before. In
the future, they can look at a map
like this and find out what problems
they can solve and what they can’t
solve.”’

While his work is basically inde-
pendent, Girard said Merrill is
helpful in directing the project. Mer-
rill’s office is only part of the entire
endeavor, though. Other people in
town are involved in different
aspects of ACCESS.

The ACCESS group meets about
every two weeks to chart progress
and discuss what needs to be done
next. It is a slow-moving procedure
because of the low funding the pro-
ject has received, Girard said.

Working in Merrill’s office and
with ACCESS is giving Girard ex-
perience in a field he hopes to pursue
as a career. He said he wants to get
into architecture and sees his current
project as a ‘‘good correlation.”’

Girard, of Coral Gables, Fla., got
his background in architecture from
engineering, drafting and surveying
courses he has taken at W&L. He also
has worked summers for architects
in Miami.

‘What I want to do when I get out
of here is probably go somewhere
and be a draftsman for a while and
then go back to school and get my
master’s,’’ he said.

Girard said he plans to take classes
at W&L next term after his jail sen-
tence expires in January. He has one
term to complete to satisfy grad-
uation requirements.

The Ring-tum Phi, October 31, 1985

 

 

Senior Gene Girard works at his drafting table as part of his work-release program from the Rockbridge County Jail

He spent the winter term of his jun-
ior year working in Vail, Colo., as a
bartender and has planned to grad-
uate in December, but complications
in arranging his work-release pre-
vented him from taking classes.

“T had assumed that I would be al-
lowed on the work-release because
the jailer and the sheriff had told me
that it was no problem with them,”
Girard said. “From what they had
done before, it had never been a pro-
blem with the judge. But that had
been in cases where plea-bargaining
arrangements had been made. [Com-
monwealth’s Attorney] John Read ...
wanted to say ‘No, I don’t want him
in school,’ which is what he did.”

Girard, who matriculated and then

 

attended classes for several days
before his September sentencing,
said court dates had been arranged
for him to ask for a work-release, but
Read postponed them until it was too
late for Girard to “get back into
school.’

Although he is unable to attend
classes, Girard is continuing his
academic work. An architectural
history major, Girard is working ona
thesis that involves work with a
Miami architectural firm called Ar-
quitectonica. Girard described the
company’s work as ‘‘a new style of
architecture’’ that has been featured
on the NBC series ‘‘Miami Vice.”

Girard said he is waiting for
library books and material from Ar-

quitectonica to continue his research.
“What I want to do is figure out what
the social continuity is between that

architecture and the society that it’s -

in, and also if it’s functional,’’ he
said. ‘“‘Do these buildings do what
they’re supposed to do? Do they func-
tion as art or as some neat, new type
of building?”

Girard’s work with ACCESS and
his research on his thesis are strictly
separate, he said, explaining that the
ACCESS work has no connection with
W&L but is a community service pro-
ject.

The two projects are not the only
ways he occupies his time. He said he
has been speaking to various groups,
along with another prisoner, about

the pair’s involvement with drugs.
Girard said he had spoken to church *
and youth groups, as well as the ,
freshman class and football team at .
W&L. “I just try to relate my ex- :
perience and maybe try tohelp some- *
one not make that kind of a mistake,”’ ,
he said.

Girard said he is somewhat dis- *
tressed by “ridiculous” rumors he ,
said he has heard, including that he
still is doing drugs and that he is do- *
ing them in jail. «

“That makes me laugh,’’ he said,
and then changed his mind. “It
doesn’t make me laugh, it makes me *
sad and laugh at the same time. The >4
fact that someone can think that I’m’
doing drugs ... to think that I wouldn’t
have learned my lesson by now.”’

Freshman class officers setting their political agendas:

Frosh president
is a veteran

By EILEEN SHEEHAN
Staff Reporter

 

 

Michael A. Forrester, the newly
elected freshman class president, is
hardly a stranger to the job — he was
president of both his junior and
senior classes in high school.

Forrester, who believes a class
party may be the way to increase uni-
ty among the already cohesive first-
year students, is a native of Baton
Rouge, La., where he attended
Belaire High School.

Forrester said he decided to run for
class office because he felt that he
had the leadership ability needed to
unify the class. Forrester said that as
class president, he wants to create a
more supportive atmosphere for the
first coeducational class by bringing
the entire freshman class together at
a freshman party so the students can
get to know each other.

When asked about Washington and
Lee’s first year of coeducation, For-
rester said he feels everything is run-
ning smoothly and the adjustments
are being made quite well. He said he
feels W&L’s situation is much like
that of Belaire High School a few
years ago, when the school was un-
dergoing desegregation. The idea

was difficult for some people to ac-
cept at first, and adjustments had to
be made but he felt the change was
beneficial.

Forrester said he feels coeducation
is advantageous to Washington and
Lee both socially and academically

Biography of Lee prepared EC representative for W&L
3 Pal

By JASON LISI
Staff Reporter

 

A freshman football player from
Texas who prepared for Washington
and Lee by reading a book on Robert
E. Lee has taken his place at the Ex-
ecutive Committee horseshoe desk as
the new freshman EC representa-
tive.

Matt Bryant of Houston won the
election for EC two weeks ago and
has been attending the regular Mon-
day night meetings since then. His
views on campus issues include the
belief that drinking alcohol is ‘‘an in-
alienable right.”

Bryant said he is interested in stu-
dying business and accounting and is
looking ahead to law school. But, as
Bryant said of his academic plans,
“‘Who really knows?”’

While saying he is still unsure of
some of his views in his new position
on the EC, the Phi Kappa Psi pledge
was forthright about his opinions on
several issues that have recently
been hot topics for campus debate.

eThe 18-year-old Bryant called the
newly enacted 21-year-old drinking
age ‘‘stupid”’ and ‘‘ignorant.”’

“It’s like Prohibition in the ’20s,”’
he added.

 

NEWS BRIEFS

Calling drinking ‘‘a tradition at
W&L,”’ Bryant said many of the
freshmen, most of whom are under
the legal drinking age in Virginia,
drink regardless of the legal age.

“T can understand Mothers Against
Drunk Driving,’’ Bryant said, but “‘if
they want to stop drunk driving, they
have to stop drunk driving’’ instead
of stopping drinking.

On the rule on the Student Control
\Committee’s guidelines that makes
“racial, ethnic, religious or sexual
slurs’ an offense punishable by ex-
pulsion, Bryant said he feels that
although there should be a certain
amount of decorum among students,
the rule has some problems.

“We all have to behave like gentle-
people,” Bryant said. ‘‘If we cheat or
steal we’re not acting in an accep-
table way. But that’s a real fine line,
areal gray area.”’

Noting that the rule has a strict
wording, Bryant said, ‘‘There has to
be a give and take; every case is go-
ing to be different.”’

On the issue of the disputed rules
concerning the use of the Student Ac-
tivities Pavilion for fraternity par-
ties, Bryant said there is ‘‘a lot of red
tape invovled’’ and that there is a
good chance of a change in those

Fraternity visitor reports jewelry stolen over weekend

+

rules in the future.

*On coeducation, Bryant said he 4

feels it will benefit the class of ’86 as —
well as the class of 89. He said that ;
during the two years he was looking
at W&L — both before and after the *
coeducation decision — his feeling .
for the school went through a change.

“When it was all-male, it really in- .
terested me,” he said, but added that -»
he thought that after coeducation, ‘‘it _
would be just a typical school.” He *
said he realized once he arrived here »
that would not happen.

Bryant feels that the Honor Sys--
tem, which is one of the EC’s main®
responsibilities, ‘‘still works.’’ He
recalled reading books on Lee’s life”
and pondering the system that Lee»
enacted at W&L. ‘

“T like to think about the Honor

System having worked for over a’

hundred years.”’

“That’s what I was elected for —to *
see that that system works,” he ad- ,
ded.

He said his future plans at W&L in-
clude continuing playing for the foot-
ball team and serving on the Execu- ‘
tive Committee. ‘‘I definitely want to .
be on the EC — it’s quite an honor.
You really have a voice in the «
school.”’ ‘

A student from Louisiana State University who was
staying at the Phi Delta Theta fraternity house this
weekend reported to police that $1,350 worth of jewelry
and cash was missing from the pocketbook she had left
in one of the rooms.

Elizabeth C. Jones of Bogalusa, La., told police that
sometime between 11 p.m. Friday and 2 p.m. Saturday
a 20-inch gold chain worth $800, a 50th anniversary gold
chain worth $500, and $50 in cash were taken from her
pocketbook, which was under a bed.

Scholar speaks on peace

An authority on political and economic affairs in
Latin America will come to Washington and Lee next
week as a Woodrow Wilson Foundation Visiting Fellow.

Peter D. Bell, senior associate of the Carnegie En-
dowment for International Peace and a former official
at the Ford Foundation and Inter-American Founda-
tion, will be on campus Nov. 3-8 to hold informal meet-
ings with students and to speak with various classes.

He also will deliver a lecture titled ‘‘The Search for
Peace in Central America’ on Monday at 7:30 p.m. in
the Northen Auditorium in the University Library. The

lecture is open to the public.

Bell received his bachelor of arts degree from Yale
University and his master of business administration
degree from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and
International Affairs at Princeton University. For more
than a decade he was a Ford Foundation resident offi-
cer in Chile. He also formerly served as deputy under
secretary of the department of Health, Education and
Welfare

Wa&L still a ‘Men’s Club’?

Journalists from Japan's Men’s Club magazine were
on campus this week to do an article about Washington
and Lee.

Men’s Club has been described by a Japanese student
at W&L as being ‘“Japan’s GQ.”’ The magazine also
features monthly stories about American colleges.

The W&L story is scheduled to appear in the March
1986 issue of the magazine, according to News Office
director Brian D, Shaw.

Geology careers outlined

Elizabeth G. Newton, senior policy adviser for fluid
mineral leasing in the Bureau of Land Management,
will speak to students Nov. 6.

At 4:30 p.m. Newton will speak on ‘‘Careers for Geo-

logists in the Federal Government.” At 8 p.m. she will
speak on ‘‘Managing the Industrial Mineral Estate.”
Both lectures, in Room 206 of Howe Hall, are free and
open to the public.

A graduate of the University of South Carolina,
Newton has done work for the U.S. Geological Survey,
the Minerals Management Service and the Bureau of
Land Management. She is involved with all aspects of
managing the federal mineral estate. Newton has been
associated with numerous applied geology programs,
including intelligence studies, geohazard analysis and
environmental assessment of mineral development
proposals.

Judge reviews Calley trial

Col. Reid W. Kennedy, judge at the trial of Lt. Wil-
liam Calley Jr., reviewed the trial in the context of his
'ecture, ‘A Soldier's Duty to Say No,”’ in Lee Chapel
last week.

Kennedy, who served in Korea and Vietnam, noted
that the proceedings against Calley had precedent in
the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals following
World War II. He pointed out, however, that the Calley
trial represented one of the few incidents of a nation
prosecuting its own war criminals.

While acknowledging that Calley was not solely re-
sponsible for the massacre, Kennedy cited testimony
that the lieutenant personally executed several villag-
ers to demonstrate that ‘Calley was guilty beyond
question.”

New requirements designed to im-
prove the physical condition and
technique of ROTC cadets and to in-
crease their exposure and identity to
the Washington and Lee community,
have been implemented by the
Military Science Department.

Starting this year, some of the
W&L cadets, who number just under
200, can be seen gathering on early
Monday, Wednesday and Friday
mornings in the ROTC parking lot
and then embarking on training exer-
cises around the W&L campus, bel-
lowing their ‘‘jodies,’’ or exercise
chants. Additionally, the cadets now
are easily identified on any Tuesday
as they decorate the Colonnade in the
camouflage ROTC fatigues.

Lt. Colonel Luke B. Ferguson, head
of the Military Science department,
says the new physical training (PT)
measures were implemented when
the traditional ‘‘laid-back”’ attitude
toward military training began to
cause problems for the W&L ROTC
program at ROTC Summer Advance
Camp in Fort Bragg, N.C.

‘The main reason we started a PT
program is because in the past two
years we've not done very well at
Summer Camp,” Ferguson said.

ROTC cadets, who are required to
attend the six-week camp after their
junior year, are evaluated on a

Registration

changes for
winter term

By CHARLES T. GAY
Staff Reporter

 

 

One of the busiest places on cam-
pus during the past week has been
the Registrar’s office, largely as a
result of registration for winter term.

“It seemed to go smoothly,” said
Washington and Lee Registrar D.
Scott Dittman.

Dittman recently compiled figures
on declared majors for 1985.
“They've basically stayed pretty
stable,’ when compared with those
of 1984.

Specitically, he said the French,
German, philosophy and chemistry
departments had gained the most
students, with philosophy leading the
pack with a 91 percent increase.

Biology was the ‘‘big loser’ with a
33 percent decline, with mathematics

and journalism absorbing fairly neg-

ligible losses.
Dittman could see no real trend in

’ his figures, but offered a prediction:

“In two or three years we'll wit-

- ness a great increase in computers. I
. feel that’s a safe assumption.”

For winter term registration, Ditt-
man introduced several new policies
designed to simplify the process as
much as possible.

This past week, all students were

_ allowed to pick up registration cards

at any time before this afternoon. In
past years each class was restricted
toa certain day.

Advisers, though they may, are not
required to submit the registration
cards. Instead, the students are.

‘We're putting the information and
the responsibility in the student’s
hands,”’ Dittman said.

number ot criteria; 22 percent of
their final evaluation is based on
their physical condition and their
ability to perform certain physical
activities. This year, Washington and
Lee’s ROTC unit fell about six points
below the camp average.

‘Some of this was attributable to
our poor physical condition and tech-
nique,’ Ferguson explained. "'l
decided this year as professor of
military science to start PT early —
in October.”

Under the new program, cadets
meet Monday, Wednesday and Fri-
day mornings at 6:50 a.m. for PT ses-
sions. Following 30 minutes of warm-
up and technique drills, the cadets
embark on a short two-to three--mile
run in formation. Those with A or B
period classes are dismissed early,
at 7:30 a.m., to ensure sufficient time
to prepare for classes.

‘Academics come first,”’
said.

While all cadets are encouraged to
participate, only those under ROTC
scholarships or contracts are re-
quired to follow the new regulations,
which began Oct. 7.

The military science department is
hoping to use the new PT program to
accomplish a number of goals, in-
cluding the encouragement of self-
motivated physical conditioning and
the development of proper condition-
ing techniques.

iency in leading the cadet batallion
and scoring 100 percent or better on
the monthly Army Physical Readi-
ness Test. To do so, a cadet must per-
form 68 pushups in under two min-
utes and 69 sit-ups in under two
minutes, and run two miles in under
13 minutes, five seconds.

Junior cadet Tom Boyd of Winches-
ter calls the PT sessions “‘reason-
able.”

‘I don’t like it,’’ Boyd said, ‘‘but I
understand why they're doing it. We
knew before we contracted that we'd
have to do something like this.

“I’m just afraid this might scare
off some of those interested in con-
tracting next year. I don’t think it’s a
good idea now — maybe in the
spring, before camp.’’

“It’s tough to get up on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday but I like the
new PT program because it forces
me to do the exercises,’ said Michael
Bowen, a junior from Lexington. ‘‘In
the past two years it’s been very
slack around here, you didn’t have to
do [PT].”

Senior John Meloy thinks the PT
program is a good idea, but added,
“Afternoon PTs might draw a more
favorable response and people might
put a little more work into it.”’

Ferguson explained that the new
requirement that cadets wear fa-
tigues on Tuesdays stems from a lack
of community identity that has
plagued the W&L ROTC program
since its inception in 1951.

are because...we’ve trained primari-
ly in an area that’s not obvious to
anyone on campus,” Ferguson said.
“People who've been in Lexington
for a lifetime are not aware that we
have an ROTC program at W&L.”’

The practice is not unique to W&L
— some 400-plus ROTC programs at
colleges and universities across the
country require the display of uni-
forms at least one full day on cam-
pus, added Ferguson.

Jurior George Boras, a cadet from

Senior David Sprunt, the 1984-85
Calyx editor, told the Executive
Committee Monday night that the
yearbook, which is already six weeks
overdue, may not even be complete
by Christmas.

‘We're still not done,’’ Sprunt said
after being asked to report to the EC
on the progress of last year’s book.

Sprunt was asked to report two
weeks ago to answer questions and

give an indication as to the progress
of the Calyx, which was to be dis-
tributed at matriculation this year.

He gave no date at which he
thought the Calyx would be com-
pleted.

“I’m working as fast as I can,”
Sprunt said. He went on to say that he
is currently working alone ‘six to
eight hours a day”’ on the estimated
35 pages still to be finished.

“A majority of the pages are most-
ly done,”’ Sprunt said.

last Friday when she walked into the

The driver, sophomore Bill M.

was driving down South Main Street
when Cleaver stepped in front of him.

‘There is no indication of reckless-

Cleaver said that she and a friend
were out shopping and decided to
cross the street.

“After that, it’s kind of a blur,”
Cleaver said.

“It was my fault. I did carelessly
walk into the street,’’ she added.

She suffered two broken bones in
her lower left leg and cuts on her
cheek and head. Her two front teeth
were loosened also, but were braced
together.

She is currently in Stonewall Jack-

since last Friday. The stitches in her

Complications set in when the ef-

Terry gains support
in Il-81 campaign tour

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
News Editor

 

Congressman Jim Olin told Lex-
ington Democrats that they ‘‘put
other cities in the valley to shame”
Monday when they gathered at the ci-
ty’s Democratic headquarters on
West Washington Street to show their
support for Mary Sue Terry, candi-
date for Virginia Attorney General.

A press aide who was accompany-
ing Terry and Olin on a Roanoke-Lex-
ington-Staunton-Harrisonburg cam-
paign trail said this was Terry’s third
appearance in Lexington since enter-
ing the race. The aide said Terry
wanted to “highlight one of the cor-
nerstones of her campaign’’ —drunk

Nov. 5 election.

Terry said she is amazed that the
Vietnam conflict claimed 50,000
American lives during the '60s and
’70s while drunk driving claims 25,000
each year.

Terry said she would like to see
mandatory convictions for drivers
with a .10 percent blood alcohol level.
She said she favors wider use of so-
briety testing and the institution of a
vehicular homicide statue.

Olin praised Terry’s ingenuity and
perserverance in her fight against
drunk driving and drug abuse during
her eight years in the General As-
sembly.

“She has been a great legislator,
and she will be an even greater attor-
ney general,’’ Olin told a group of

Local political leaders cite W&L students’ interest

 

By SEAN BUGG
Staff Reporter

 

Leaders of both of Lexington’s political committees
have been holding fund-raisers and garnering support
for their candidates in next week’s elections, and they
expressed appreciation for the help given them by Wash-
ington and Lee students.

W. Arthur Beeton, chairman of the Rockbridge Repub-
lican Combined Committee, said, ‘‘We have had excel-
lent help from W&L Republicans, and especially the
Law School Republicans.”’

Law Professor William S. Geimer serves as chairman
of the Lexington Democratic Committee, and he also
praised the political interest of law students and
undergraduate students.

The Republicans have had several special events
leading up to the Nov. 5 elections, including a special
breakfast for the three candidates, and a special dinner
for gubernatorial candidate Wyatt B. Durrette.

Another event Beeton mentioned was a luncheon held

about 25 supporters and reporters.

the four cities.

at noon on Monday for the wives of the three candidates.
Mrs. John Chichester, wife of the lieutenant governor
candidate, and Mrs. Buster O’Brien, wife of the attorney
general candidate, both attended, while Miss Virginia of
1984 satin for Mrs. Durrette.

Geimer said the Democrats have been busy running
phone banks, sending out mailings, and operating the
local headquarters.

“The local party itself doesn’t conduct fund-raisers,”’
Geimer said. He added that they were ‘“‘very pleased
with local donations,”’ which enabled them to get mail-
ings to every registered voter in Rockbridge County.

Geimer also expressed satisfaction with the job being
done by W&L undergraduate and Law School Demo-
crats, saying that they have helped in hanging posters,
distributing literature, and other jobs ‘‘at one time or
another.”

Geimer added that his political interest stems from ‘‘a
general belief ... in delivering the services government
ought to deliver to people that Democrats generally do
better than Republicans.”’

CRs’ and YDs’ satisfaction

comes from party’s success

 

By DANATHA HOFFMAN
Staff Reporter

 

As November 5 swiftly approaches,
and the gubernatorial election be-
tween Wyatt Durrette (R) and
Gerald Baliles (D) heats up, the
Republicans and Democrats around
the state are gearing up for last
minute battles.

Washington and Lee’s Young De-
mocrats and College Republicans
have jumped into the Virginia guber-
natorial battle and are assisting their
favorite campaigns as Tuesday —
Election Day — draws near.

Young Democrats Chairman
Everett Hamilton said his group has
been working in shifts at the Lex-
ington Democratic headquarters.

Hamilton, as a member of the Lex-
ington Democratic Committee, at-
tended initial planning meetings con-

cerning strategies and fundraisers.

Similarly, the College Repub-
licans, led by John Pensec, have
manned the Republican headquar-
ters above the Herring Travel agen-
cy, answering any questions that in-
dividuals might have. They have
done numerous literature drops. Dur-
ing the election itself, they will man
the two area polls at city hall and the
Lexington Firehouse.

On election night, Hamilton and
one other Democrat along with two
Republicans will report via telephone
from Richmond for W&L’s Cable
Channel 9 and WLUR-FM on the
mood and atmosphere at their re-
spective headquarters.

Both Hamilton and Pensec said the
main reason they are involved so
heavily in the election was not an in-
terest in Virginia politics but rather a
partisan interest. Pensec remarked
that he had been heavily involved in

Republican politics in his home state
of New Jersey and had carried that
interest over to W&L.

“T honestly believe that [Wyatt B.]
Durrette is the superior candidate,”
he said. ‘‘It is not so much whether it
is New Jersey or Virginia, but rather
it’s the Republican party. Durrette
has a solid Republican platform with
the same beliefs that I possess.’’

Hamilton called himself a ‘‘true-
blue Democrat.”

“I strongly believe that the Demo-
cratic party is the better one and as
long as I am working for the
Democrats — wherever — I am
working for the right party,”’
Hamilton said.

Both said they expect to attend a
victory celebration.

“We have worked hard and are ex-
cited about attending the victory par-
ty at the Marriott in Richmond on the
fifth,’ Pensec enthused.

Durrette charges opponent with
switch on issue of teacher pay

 

By TIMOTHY McMAHON
Staff Reporter

 

Democratic gubernatorial can-
didate Gerald L. Baliles has reversed
himself on the issue of merit pay for
teachers, his Republican opponent,
Wyatt B. Durrette, charged in a
speech Saturday at the Keydet
General hotel just outside Lexington.

Speaking to approximately 75 Re-
publicans at a fund-raising dinner in
the hotel’s restaurant, Durrette call-
ed that reversal ‘‘the most astonish-
ing change of view...in the recent an-
nals of Virginia politics.”

Baliles’ proposal, which was
released Thursday, would provide
“up to 500 ‘outstanding teacher
awards’ of $1,000 each to teachers
across the state each year’’ and
“supplement the awards with $4,000
stipends for special study and
research by outstanding teachers.”’
The plan would only be implemented
after Baliles’ goal of raising teacher
salaries to the national average was
reached.

Baliles says his new plan is dif-
ferent from the merit pay scheme
that he believes Durrette has in mind
because it would not disturb teacher
pay scales.

Durrette released a statement on
Baliles Friday morning that said:
“This spring, he agreed with the
teachers’ union opposition to merit
pay, in order to win the Democratic
nomination....Now, a few days before
election, when he’s trying to reach
Virginia voters in general, he says he
favors some form of merit pay.”’

After his speech to the Lexington
group, Durrette said he believed this
change of opinion would hurt Baliles’
credibility with voters. Durrette also
said his staff might prepare some
new advertising based on the merit

pay issue.
Durrette centered much of his dis-

cussion on strategy for the last 10
days of the campaign, asking the au-
dience to mention his name at any
given opportunity. He recognized
that he was behind Baliles in most
every poll, but said that recently he
had been gaining between one and
four points in the polls while Baliles’
standing had remained constant.

He also said that in several recent
elections, including those of US.
Senators John Warner and Paul S.
Trible Jr. and Governor Mills E.
Godwin Jr. — all Republicans — the
Republican candidate had trailed in
the polls until very close to Election
Day. As in those elections, there has
been a significant number of ‘“‘unde-
cided’’ voters in the polls this year,
Durrette said and as before, those
“undecideds” are in traditionally
Republican-voting areas.

Lexington’s Republican Party
Chairman W. Arthur Beeton express-
ed similar feelings before the speech,
saying, ‘I don’t care what the polls
say. It’s the fourth quarter, brother,
and we are going to win.”’

After the speech, however, Dur-
rette said he would have to run a
“near perfect last 10 days” to win the
election.

Nonetheless, Durrette cited the
presence of several nationally known
political figures who have recently
taken a strong interest in his cam-
paign, most notably President Ron-
ald Reagan and Vice President
George Bush, as evidence that “‘this
election matters’ not only to Virginia
but also to the rest of the country.

“There are some major changes
going on in this nation in terms of
political party realignment, and it’s
happening more in the South than
anywhere else,”’ Durrette said.

“Our election now is the election
that America is looking at to see if
this momentum will continue in the
South. They are also looking at it to

see if Governor Robb, with his na-
tional ambitions, is going to be suc-
cessful in transferring his mantle.
Make no mistake that our election is
viewed in that context.”’

Noting that some voters perceive
little difference between himself and
Baliles politically, Durrette stated
that the one main difference was his
commitment to ‘‘fiscal responsibili-
ty,” which he claimed to mean a
commitment to a state government
whose expenses would not require a
“general fund tax increase.’’ He then
stated that Baliles is proposing new
government programs with a total
expenditure of more than $2 billion,
which he claimed could only be paid
for by increasing general fund taxes.

With regard to other specific
issues, Durrette came out strongly in
favor of education reforms, including
the attainment of new textbooks for
Virginia public schools and the for-
mation of a tax-exempt savings plan
to allow parents to set aside money
for their children’s higher education
plans without paying taxes on the
principal or the interest.

Asking for a job may be one of the
worst ways to get it.

That’s why University placement
consultant Stephen P. Bredin advises
seniors to eschew the traditional job-
hunting routine and instead go on a
spree of “informational interview-
ing.”

He told a workshop Tuesday that a
stydent using the technique learns
about firms that interest him by ar-
religing conferences with an employ-
ee,of the company — preferably a
recruiter.

“You don’t [need to] ask for a job
beeause they can tell from the way
you’re phrasing the questions that
you’re in the market,” Bredin ex-
nlained. “You don’t threaten any-
body, and believe me, anybody is

job.”

Bredin, now in his third year at
Washington and Lee, has worked as
an overseas employment manager
for an affiliate of the Exxon Corp.,
has served as M.B.A. recruting man-
ager for that firm and worked for
nine years as the placement director
at the University of Virginia’s Col-
gate Darden School of Business Ad-
ministration.

The job-search schedule Bredin re-
commends is researching firms in
November, doing some initial inter-
views in December and meeting with
recruiters in January through
March.

In April, firms begin extending of-
fers, many of which are turned down,
giving a student a chance to be pick-
ed up on a second round of hiring in
May and June, which Bredin said is a
critical period in which final plans
should be made.

     

463-5752

‘July is dead, August even deader
and before you know it, you’ve gotten
to September and you don’t have a
job and people begin to wonder why
you don’t,”’ he said.

Bredin said his goal is to have 60
firms interview on campus this
winter. He said 42 are committed to
coming but that it is uncertain
whether 18 more can be lined up.

He said many firms this year are
sharply reducing their number of
campus visits, which he cost about
$6,000 per recruiter for each campus
at which the company interviews.

United Virginia Bank, for example,
has traveled to W&L for the last 10 to
15 years but this winter will not inter-
view in Lexington.

Bredin said that each recruiting
season, the bank receives 1,000
resumes, culls those to about 600, in-
terviews about 200 candidates and
then makes approximately 29 offers.

Carole Chappell, the former
secretary of the University Center,
has been promoted to recruitment co-
ordinator.

Under the new title, she is present-
ly working on a career placement
project, Challenge ’86, a liberal arts
career fair.

As a member of the Recruitment
Office, Chappell is responsible for
helping seniors find jobs in the career
area of their choice. This is done
through “one on one interaction”
with students and organized pro-
grams like workshops, which deal
with such areas as interviews, resu-
mes and even LSATs.

With her new promotion, Chappel
has moved from the glassed-in office
in the front hall of the University
Center to a new office further down
the hall.

She laments that she has less con-
tact with students in her new posi-
tion. “Before, if you had a problem, it
was, ‘see Carole Chappell,’ I liked
that.”

Senior Townes Pressler, who as
senior class president spends a lot of
time in the University Center, echoed
Chappell’s sentiments, saying he
missed seeing her in the front office.

“She was always so friendly, and
it’s great being able to call her by her
first name. That always impressed
the kids on tours.”

Challenge ’86 is a career fair that
takes place at the Radisson Hotel in
Lynchburg in November.

Chappell serves as the coordinator
between the program and W&L. At
the fair, 54 companies will have infor-
mation tables, and some will be offer-
ing individual interviews.

“The companies are saying, ‘Hey,

why should we go anywhere if the
resumes are coming in to us?’ ”
Bredin said, noting that the effect is
for the firms to “save money but
sacrifice quality.”

Bredin said that although the IBM
Corp. sales training program is tops
in the nation, W&L has “‘no relation-
ship with IBM.”

“Any relationship we had,”’ Bredin
explained, ‘‘we managed to destroy”’
by purchasing a Prime computer
system this summer after IBM had
bid on the installation.

“They go where they’re most
welcome,” he said. ““You scratch my
back and I'll scratch yours.”

“IBM is tough,” he added, shaking
his head. ‘“‘I’d love to have IBM
here.”

“lousy” record of attracting, Bredin
said, are food companies and brand

Chappell is a graduate of Southern

One exception is that Procter and
Gamble Inc., which Bredin said has
“the premier marketing training
program in the United States,” will
be interviewing at W&L for the first
time this year.

Another first this winter will be a
policy allowing companies to pre-
screen half of their interviewees by
selecting them in advance from the
Resume Book published by the
Placement Office.

Bredin said companies have been
pressuring the school for several
years to allow such pre-selection, but
that W&L held off for several years

worked at W&L for seven years. She
is presently taking psychology class-
es at Mary Baldwin College during
her spare time.

: Intricacies of job-hunting include ‘informational interviewing’

because it believed the policy unfair
to interested students.

He added that if a student isn’t able
to obtain a spot on a recruiter’s
average slate of 14 interviews, he
usually can find a chance to make
some contact with the representative
anyway.

The consultant said that in dealing
with interviewers, though, there’s a
fine line between being persistent
and overly aggressive.

“If you know he’s staying at the
McCampbell Inn, I don’t see any-
thing wrong with calling up the room
and saying: ‘I know it’s late, but I
didn’t get a chance to see you and I
want to see you while you’re here,’ ”
he said.

“He can either take that as being
embarrassingly assertive or can say,
‘That’s certainly an aggressive
young man. By God, I better talk to
him.’ ”’

ridders do it again,

 

By DAVID EMRICH
Staff Reporter

 

This is beginning to get repetitious:

You know the story, the General
gridders fall behind early, usually by
at least 10 points, and then proceed to
outplay their opponent the rest of the
way to come away with a seemingly
easy victory. This time they travel-
led to Sewanee, Tenn., and played out
their little drama against the Univer-
sity of the South, clinching, in the
process, a school record-tying sixth
straight winning season.

Trailing 14-0 after the Tigers
scored on their first two possessions,
the Generals tallied 10 unanswered
points, including the first of Kevin
Weaver's four touchdowns, a 43-yard
scamper, to cut the half-time deficit
to four points. In the third quarter,
Weaver scored again to put the
Generals up 17-14.

The lead, however, vanished when
the Tigers scored on a 17-yard pass to
make it 21-17 heading into the fourth
quarter. Then the Generals took con-
trol. They scored three touchdowns,
two by Weaver and one on a reverse

= will go the way of Haystack
Calhoun. It is a fate I wish on no man who makes his living by his
largeness.

I am also worried that there are people in the world whose every
breath contains one of these worries. They undoubtedly are those
same people who read The National Enquirer for its investigative
journalism and are concerned that Santa Claus really knows whether
they’ve been bad or good.

Okay, I admit it. Professional wrestling does appeal to me. Does
that make me a bad person? I also like to eat Gummi Bears by the
pound. I know it’s not the best thing for me, but the darned things taste
so good.

That’s kind of the way it is with professional wrestling (or ‘‘rasslin”
— let’s be informal) and me. It’s a pleasant diversion to get caught up
in things that don’t matter all that much anyway, like video games.
(Problems start cropping up, though, when you believe the little
umpire-character in ‘‘Vs. Tennis’’ is a sentient being. )

In a way, this nation’s attraction to professional wrestling is good.
When you look at the things that have happened at European and
South American soccer games, you can breathe a sigh of relief that
wrestling sort of handles most of the bottle-throwing types by keeping
them inside, where the 6-4, 250-pound objects of their aggression are a
bit closer and hence a bit more intimidating than they are on the foot-
ball field. Would you threaten a very large thing that chews the stuff-
ing out of a turnbuckle, has a green tongue and goes by the nickname
of ‘The Animal,” if he were standing less than an arm’s length away?
NOT.

In professional wrestling, as opposed to almost every other profes-
sional sport, with the possible exception of chess, you know who the
good guys are and you know who the bad guys are. Kind of like that old
action cartoon “Johnny Quest.”’ It just wasn’t possible that Haji would
turn out to be a closet dope fiend. The same goes with the World
Wrestling Federation (and any of those other subsidiary wrestling
leagues). Some former bad guy might be reformed, some good guy
might sour with time, but it is always clear cut.

What’s more, these good duys are reputable role models. Mr. T. is
loved by kids, as are Hulk Hogan and many other wrestlers. (Witness
the new Saturday morning wrestling cartoon show.) There’s no threat
here that the sports heroes are suddenly going to be testifying in front
of a grand jury investigating drug trafficking in professional wrest-
ling. Never. The Hulkster wouldn't allow it. He’d break you in half,
while whistling ‘‘The Eye of the Tiger’’ (of course).

But wait a sec, pal. This “rasslin’’ thing isn’t real. It’s a fake, a
sham, a show. No argument from this corner. (If you believe it is real,
you are, as mentioned above, a member of the editorial board at the
Enquirer). What it is, is a good time, certainly a better show than
those never-ending soap operas we call real sports...

....Back home on the Parents’ Weekendified Colonnade, a major
league tip of the cap to the fledgling women’s program at W&L on at-
taining its first victory. Many more will follow in the near future...If
you're looking for a good deal breakfast on parents’ weekend, pick up
a couple of tickets for the lacrosse team’s pancake hoe-down Saturday
morning...Speaking of Saturday, MS should make some money with
their donations-by-W&L-offensive-output charity event during the
gridders’ dismantling of Bridgewater, who gave Emory and Henry all
it could handle back in early September. A point to consider, but one
not to be fretted over...

....Quick thoughts while vacuuming: Did the Cards lose the Series or
did the Royals win it? After Sunday, you can feel safe in calling the
Cardinals “‘losers,’’ in the worst sense of the word, and the Royals
‘‘winners,”’ in the best sense of the word....Bears’ unbeaten season will
end this week or next...George Gervin will not last with the Bulls
unless he agrees that Michael Jordan gets top billing... Do we need peo-
ple like George Steinbrenner in baseball? Does he serve any purpose
other than making us sick? I thought not...

...Finally, Amherst College football coach said ‘‘No!’’ to ESPN
covering the Amherst-Williams game on Nov. 9. Says coach, ‘‘We're in
education, we aren’t in the entertainment business.’’ True, but it sure
would be nice to let the country know that there are some good things
happening in college football...

The Washington and Lee soccer
team split two home contests this
past week, winning on Saturday
against Hampden-Sydney and losing
on Wednesday to Roanoke in a game
that gave the Maroons the Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference soccer
crown.

Yesterday’s loss saw the Generals
fall victim to an inspired Roanoke
squad in hot pursuit of the conference
title. From the initial whistle to the
last tick of the clock, the Maroons
controlled play, shutting out the
Generals, 2-0.

The ODAC champs immediately
took control of the middle third of the
field, an area considered sacred by
soccer strategists, and from there,
they directed the tempo of the game.

Offensively, Roanoke penetrated

yards on 33 carries. In all five games
since returning to the lineup after an
injury that kept him out of the season
opener, he has run for at least 100
yards. He currently leads the ODAC
with an average of 144 yards per
game.

ine defense again played well, giv-
ing up some yards, but getting the
turnover when it was needed. They
gave the offense good field position,
and the offense was able to take ad-
vantage of it.

the’ W&L defense with a razor-sharp
passing attack. In their own end, the
Maroons rarely neglected their de-
fensive assignments, limiting the
Generals to a kick-and-run offense
for the majority of the first half.

When W&L installed its long-ball
attack,the Roanoke defense matched
up with the Generals stride for stride.

The Maroons scored their first goal
at 16:10 of the first half. Senior for-
ward Ted Delledera, a 1984 All-ODAC
selection and shoo-in for more honors
this season, beat W&L netminder
Chris Gareis to a loose ball and got
enough of it to push it across the goal
line.

Hoping to limit that goal difference
to one for the rest of the half, the
Generals tightened up their defense.
The Maroons were able to break
through, however, and at 2:32 sopho-
more forward Dave Denbow tallied
the game’s final goal with a neatly
placed head ball off of a corner kick.

Running against perhaps their
weakest competition of the year, the
Washington and Lee men’s cross
country team got back on the winning
track with three victories, while the
women earned their first victory of
the season, the first official win by a
W&L women’s team.

For the most part, the second half
was an instant replay of the first half,
minus the scoring plays. The Roa-
noke defense continued to frustrate
the W&L offense and kept the Gen-
erals off the scoreboard. Excellent
goaltending by Gareis and later
freshman Sheldon Clark prevented
the Maroons from adding to the 2-0
final score.

Saturday, the Generals fared much

As the Washington and Lee water
polo team has known would be the
case from Day One, the entire season
culminates this weekend in the
Southern League Championships, at
W&L’s Cy Twombly Pool.

Although no one is ruling out an
upset, the championship match looks
to be the fourth and final meeting for
W&L and archrival Richmond.

The Generals have taken the title
three of the last four years. It was
Richmond, though, which last year
put a halt to W&L’s dominance. The
Spiders have continued to plague
W&L, winning all three of this year’s
confrontations.

Through the losses the Generals
have remained objective, they have
been guided all season by the know-
ledge of this final confrontation.

A win over the Spiders in Sunday’s
final has been the goal from Day One.
Coach Page Remillard has been

‘to polo’s goal

pleased with the team’s improved
performance and he knows it all
comes down to Sunday at one o'clock.

“We need something radical, and
at the same time it will be well-
thought-out and well-executed,”’
Remillard commented.

In addition to going all-out in the
water, the team will be looking to ex-
ternal factors for support, namely a
large, partisan crowd at Twombly
Pool, Remillard said.

“We want to have what Richmond
has had all along. They pack. their
pool,” Remillard said.

The team believes that the com-
bination of the championship and
Parents’ Weekend will provide for a
good crowd. In addition, though, they
will open the deck around the pool for
additional seating and at the half
there will be a relay race of fraterni-
ty pledge teams.

The combination of the Richmond-
W&L rivalry will pack stands and set
the stage for a great match, a stage
that has been set for the Generals
since water polo practice began.

Rah-rah?

Cheerleaders at W&L
a possibility for 1986

 

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee has
cheerleaders?

Maybe as soon as next year, ac-
cording to Assistant Athletic Direc-
tor Cinda Rankin. Numerous stu-
dents, mostly women from the fresh-
man class, have formally and infor-
mally expressed an interest in form-
ing a cheerleading squad.

The idea of cheerleading may be
new to W&L students, but it is not
new to the school. According to As-
sociate Athletic Director Dick Miller,
“We used to have an all-male cheer-
leading squad back in the ’50s, and
then about 10 years or so ago we had
Sweet Briar girls and Southern Semi-
nary girls help us out.”’

But with a decline in interest came
the fall of cheerleading at W&L.

Since this summer, though, Rankin
has received letters and informal
questions regarding the existence of
cheerleading at W&L. The Athletic
Department is first encouraging the
development of cheerleading as a
club activity, in order to “establish
consistency,’’ according to Miller.

As a club, tomorrow’s cheerlead-
ers would have to establish them-
selves as an organization for the
benefit of the student body, with a
faculty adviser and possible funding
from the Executive Committee.

According to freshman Danatha
Hoffman from Raleigh, N.C., ‘‘A lot
of people are interested.”’ That in-
terest comes from cheering in high
school, she added.

Lucy Anderson of Houston, Texas,
said, ‘‘There are some guys who are
interested, too.’’ Anderson and Hoff-
man agreed that it would be ‘“‘more
fun” as a coeducational program.

‘That’ s one thing we've been able
to do well up to this point, capitalize
on our opponents’ mistakes,” said
Fallon, ‘‘and I hope we can continue
to do that type of thing.”’

Saturday, the Cenerals face’ the
Eagles of Bridgewater College. The
Eagles have a 1-5 record, but Fallon
is not t.aking them lightly. ‘“We’re
going to have to be up for them,”’ said
Fallon. ‘‘They’re a very dangerous
team and we can’t keep going to the
well like we have been.”’

“Bridgewater will be one of the
most dangerous teams we play,
because they have nothing to lose,’
said Fallon. “‘They have five losses to
fi¥e very tough teams. They scored
22 points against Emory and Henry;
we didn’t score any.”’

“Looking at the two records, peo-

ple are thinking W&L should beat
Bridgewater,” said Fallon, “but you
can be sure that Bridgewater isn’t
thinking that.”

“They have played some great
teams and you can be sure that they
won’t be in awe of us. We’re going to
caution the players that this is our
last ODAC game and we have to win
it if we are going to have a shot at the
conference title.”

SIDELINES...The last time the
Generals had six consecutive win-
ning seasons was between 1919 and
1924.... W&L is now 5-1 (3-1) ....
Bridgewater is 1-5 (1-2) The
Generals lead the series 12-3...Last
year the Generals beat the Eagles
31-0 at Bridgewater as Frank Surface
carried 16 times for 107 yards... Last
week Bridgewater lost 33-0 to St.
Pauls, and their starting halfback,
Billy Mays, dislocated his shoulder...

“The Merchant of Venice’

‘proves ‘shining’ production

 

’ By NELSON PATTERSON
' Theater Critic

 

The University Theatre’s produc-
* tion of ‘The Merchant of Venice”
» marks a significant accomplishment
of fine Shakespearean drama at
“ Washington and Lee. The comedy
» accomplishes everything that it
undertakes with few exceptions, and
* in those few areas where the play
« fails, only the professional could take
, great offense.
Perhaps the strongest criticism
‘ that can be leveled against the pro-
+ duction is not a criticism of the play
itself but the facility in which it is
' produced. The Troubadour Theatre
, has the ventilation of a wind tunnel in
the first three rows, and on a cool
‘ mid-autumn’s night, that does not
, make for happy patrons. Heat was
and is nonexistent in the theater.
‘ Similarly, the stage seems especially
small for this play. The set, though
‘ elaborate in its mechanical wonders,
, seems to crowd the stage and leaves
little room for actors to enter and exit
‘with any semblance of ease. What-
_ ever happened to the empty Shake-
spearean stage?
+ The clever plot is carefully con-
structed in the first half of the play
* with the aid of fine performances by
, the major characters. Vernon Eagle
plays the devilish and vengeful An-
« tonio with great ease and a sly, ever-
, present sneer of mischief and cunn-
ing. His erstwhile friend and Portia’s

courtier David Marsh (Bassanio)
turns in a consistent performance
with a strong voice and the expected
theatrical flair.

But the play really begins to roll
when Susan Still (Portia) appears on
the set (‘‘rolled” onto the set with the
aid of the revolving scenery) looking
like Linda Rondstadt posing for her
latest Nelson Riddle album cover.
Still’s near-flawless performance as
the Belmontian heiress in search of a
good husband enlivens the second
scene and keeps the audience hoping
that every suitor will fail in his at-
tempt to secure the sweet Portia so
that we can see Still and Delia Ford
(Nerissa) make faces on the set in
anxious anticipation of marriage.
Still’s and Ford’s comical ways are
worthy of special note. With the bois-
terous (at times, one wishes he would
use his scimitar on his vocal cords)
and bawdy William R. Kinson (The
Prince of Morocco) and the demure,
pompous Mark McDonough (The
Prince of Aragon).

But all is well that ends well, and
end well this show does. Joseph Mar-
tinez’s Shylock is spellbinding, at
once making the audience hate the
Jewish money-lender while sympath-
izing with him for the social ostraciz-
ation he has undergone for his relig-
ious beliefs. Though he walks with a
cane in portraying the character,
Martinez’s stunning portrayal needs
no assistance, and the show estab-
lishes itself in great part because of

his commendable rendering. In the
words of the Bard himself, one
almost wishes Martinez “‘all the joy
that you can wish’’ for his perfor-
mance.

The comedy in the play gains
greatly from the humorous role of
Bassanio’s roving trumpet/Shylock’s
former servant, Craig Smith
(Launcelot Gobbo). His handling of
his blind father, John Boller (Old
Gobbo), has the audience hoping that
the edge of the stage is sturdy and
that Smith’s grip is firm as Boller
teeters perilously, his arms groping
for any familiar face or limb to grap-
ple with or identify. There ought to be
more roles for Smith in future pro-
ductions.

Al Gordon’s direction is also to be
praised, for he works with raw talent
and a small stage and delivers a shin-
ing product. Few members of the au-
dience can feel wronged by his inter-
pretation of Shakespeare, and fewer
still will leave the Troubadour hoping
that future shows will improve. The
peril of starting off the dramatical
year-with ‘‘The Merchant of Venice”
is that it leaves little room for im-
provement and establishes a critical
audience that expects quality perfor-
mances. In its 50th year, that might
not be too much to expect of the
Troubadour and the drama faculty.

The play runs through Nov. 2. W&L
students and faculty are admitted
free of charge. Reservations can be
made through the University
Theatre, 463-8637.

p.m. to5 p.m. Sunday.

Also on campus is the duPont Art
Gallery. On display are photographs
by Mathew Brady, the Civil War pho-

‘tographer. The exhibit is on loan
_ from the National Portrait Gallery’s
Meserve Collection and contains a
rnumber of photographs of 19th-
,century presidents. Photographs
taken of Abraham Lincoln a short
‘time before his death are particular-
_ly interesting. The gallery is open
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday
‘through Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on
Saturday, and 2 to 4 p.m. on Sundays.
Moving a few miles away from
“campus, a most interestng and uni-
que place to visit is the Art Farm.
The Art Farm is a gallery operated
“by Professor I-Hsiung Ju, and is
‘located on Route 39 on the way to
,Goshen. The present exhibit shows
works by Ju and his family, some of
which are Oriental in nature. It is a
diverse array of very interesting art-
work. The Art Farm is almost always
‘open, and Ju will be there Saturday
fo greet visitors.

A little further from campus, you
might wish to take a drive on the Blue
Ridge . Parkway. If your mother
wants to ‘‘see the leaves’’ as mothers
often do, this drive could be crucial to
keeping her happy.

If you want to really make your
parents think you know what’s going
on around the Lexington area, sug-
gest a trip to Monticello, home of
Thomas Jefferson. If the only time
that you have seen Monticello is on
the back of a nickel, you will be in for
an education in the life of Jefferson.
The outbuildings and inventions of
Jefferson are particularly interest-
ing. If you go to Charlottesville on a
nice day, you can expect to wait an
hour or so to get inside the main
house. The wait is not so bad, as the
people in the line get to take advan-
tage of a panoramic vista and read
brochures passed out as you wait.
Moreover, the conversation of the
other waiting patrons is in itself
entertainment. During my recent
wait, I heard people compare Win-
nebago stories, the joys of pulling a
31-foot trailer around Virginia, and
the sad life stories of two guys who
went to the University of California
at Berkley. Monticello is a few miles
past Charlottesville off of Interstate

64. And a bonus is the proximity of
Ash Lawn, home of President James
Monroe. The drive is about 65 miles,
and the entrance fee is $4 per person.

When you and your parents finish
all of these activities, there is no
doubt you will be hungry. Since you
are no doubt tired of Spanky’s and
The Palms, why not have them take
you to The Homestead or The Green-
brier for dinner? Both are something
to see, especially if you get there
before dark. Personally, I suggest
the Homestead. The employees at the

-Greenbrier have somewhat of a

haughty attitude — upon my recent
arrival, 15 minutes late for my reser-
vation, the maitre d’ griped about
seating me in his 90 percent empty
dining room. Regardless, both places
suggest reservations and run about
$30 per person.

So do something with your parents
when you are finished with the usual
fare of fraternities, football and
feasting. You’ll be glad you did. Be-
ing so knowledgeable about these
other local attractions, your parents
might forgive less than stellar mid-
term grades because they will realize
that you are learning about those
“outside the classroom”’ things that
are “‘such an important part of the
college experience.” Bon voyage.

Dos, don’ts for TV
with Mom and Dad

 

By BILL HANNA
Television Critic

 

Once again, parents will make
their way into Lexington to visit their
children and make sure the tuition
money is going to good use. The
weekend will be filled with functions
of one kind or another and is usually
a lot of fun.

There is one problem, though.
Despite how well a person may get
along with the folks, the pattern of
behavior for the weekend will almost
always have to be changed from the
pattern that took so much effort to
develop over the year.

This may have to do with putting a
girlfriend/boyfriend into boarding
house for the weekend, cleaning up
things normally not thought of such
as a refrigerator or even resorting to
changing television habits.

Unfortunately, there are few shows
on this weekend that will amuse the
average parent. You could always sit
them in front of ‘‘Miami Vice’’ on
Friday and they may like it or just be
too tired from the trip in to do any-
thing but sleep.

Another option for Saturday would
be the Iowa-Ohio State football game
at 2:30 on CBS.

There is one wholesome family-
type movie on Sunday at noon on
channel 12. Sidney Poitier will give
an Oscar-winning performance in
“The Lilies of the Field.”

There are a few things regarding
television that may even make you
look good, well maybe only two I can
think of.

If your parents ask if they could
switch on the TV to see what’s on,
just say, ‘“You could try it, but I don’t
even know if it still works.”’

Another line that may convince
them that television is in no way af-
fecting your school work could be us-
ed halfway through whatever you
may be watching at the time. Just get
up and say, “‘TV really tires me out if
I watch it much more than an hour. I
think I may catch up on a little study-
ing while you watch the rest of the
show.”

The things not to do about televi-
sion are many and obvious so I will
only list a few:

eDon’t suggest that a meal should
either be hurried or delayed so you
can be home by the time wrestling
starts.

eDon’t suggest watching the open-
ing tournament of the bowling season
on NBC.

*Finally, don’t be seen watching
“The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilli-
gan’s Island’’ Sunday at noon.

Now for a little of what’s going on
in television.

Once again, ‘Hill Street Blues”
has made it to this space. Despite the
firing of Stephen Bochco, the show
can not take advantage of the in-
credible ratings of the shows before
it.

Since the start of the season, the
average Nielsen ratings have put
“The Cosby Show’’ at number one,
followed by ‘Family Ties,” and
“‘Cheers,”’ while “Night Court”’ is in
a tie for the number 10 spot. NBC is
continuing to try to figure out why
people get up and change the channel
to either “‘Knots Landing”’ or ‘‘20/20"’
after watching the first four shows.

An attempt is being made now to
introduce new characters into the
show to try to give it more punch.

-:This makes one wonder what will

happen to the old characters as the
new ones move in.

Charles Haid, who plays Renko on
the show, said the cast is signed to a
seven-year contract which will end at
the end of next season, and he thinks
none of the original members of the
show will return. An easy solution to
the problem.

NBC, despite its successes this
year, has other problems as well.
‘Amazing Stories,’’ which NBC has
contracted for 44 episodes, is slump-
ing toward the rank of 40 while
another show the network had high
hopes for, ‘Alfred Hitchcock
Presents” has made it into the lower
40s.

NBC shouldn’t feel completely
alone in regard to shows they thought
would do well, but didn’t. CBS is get-
ting a poor showing from ‘The
Twilight Zone,’’ and ABC has been
disappointed by Robert Urich’s
return in ‘‘Spenser: For Hire.”’

The World Series helped to bring
ABC some respectable ratings as
most of the games finished in the top
20. The series going seven games also

got ABC some added advertising re-
venues, but not at the rate of $130,000
for 30 seconds as in the first games of
the series.

Since there was no way of telling
how many games the series would
go, advertising space was sold ds the
‘if necessary’’ games were needed.
This meant the advertising time went
at reducedrates to assure enough ads
to cover the cost of showing the
game.

Now into the highlights of the
week:

Thursday: ABC puts Sean Connery
back into action as James Bond in
“Goldfinger’’ at 8 tonight. This is one
of the better Bond films as 007 match-
es wits with Auric Goldfinger and his
accomplice, Pussy Galore.

This being Halloween, there is the
usual line-up of horror movies. At 8,
channel 12 will show ‘‘Damien-Omen
Il” while HBO starts at the same
time with ‘‘Halloween”’ followed by
“C.H.U.D.” and ‘‘Night of the Living
Dead.”

“The Tonight Show Starring John-
ny Carson’ (this week Joan Rivers)
has Pee Wee Herman and Elvira as
guests while David Letterman
follows with Howard Cosell.

Saturday: Channel 5 will show a
classic Jack Nicholson film tonight at
11 as ‘‘Chinatown”’ is aired.

Someone may also want to watch
yet another NBC wrestling card
tonight at 11:30 as we will even see
scenes from a wrestler’s Halloween
party.

Sunday: Today looks good after
“Lillies of the Field” at noon on chan-
nel 12. Bronson has a double-feature
on channel 5 starting at 4 with
‘Death Wish’’ followed by ‘‘Border-
line.’’ At 8 p.m., HBO will show “‘The
Little Drummer Girl” while ABC
begins the “North and South’’ mini
series at 9 and NBC shows ‘48
Hours’’ at the same time.

Monday: Channel 12 will have a
classic Hitchcock film, ‘‘The Birds’’
on at 8 p.m. A movie worth watching,
especially when Namath and O.J. are
announcing the Cardinals-Cowboys
game.

Wednesday: Peanuts fans will be
treated to a new Charlie Brown
special as ‘“‘You’re a Good Man,
Charlie Brown’’ is shown on channel
7 at 8 tonight.

Off to Georgetown to find ‘the best time’

 

By PAUL DAVEY
Social Critic

 

Although it lies some 180 miles out-
side of the Lexington city limits,
Washington, D.C. may easily be con-
sidered part of the Washington and
Lee social scene.

On any weekend evening between
September and May, one is sure to
encounter W&L students and alumni
and acquaintances from the local
girls’ schools in Georgetown. Why,
one might ask, would people who no

- doubt have papers and tests to worry
- about travel six hours to go to a cou-
ple of bars? The answer from many

What then constitutes ‘the best
time?’’ Is it because many of the
pedestrians on M street are no doubt
KGB spies or Arab American-
haters? Or is it because the D.C.
crime rate must exceed that of Lex-
ington many times over? Or is it
because upon getting close to D.C.
one can no longer see the stars in the
sky that were shining so brightly in
Rockbridge County? I must say that I
do not think these things constitute
“the best time.”

What makes Washington, D.C.
(and Georgetown in particular) such
a lure for W&L people is that it is a
total escape. It is a totally different

Open all night

Lloyd is lone late-night survivor as
Hojo’s and Hardee’s close every night

 

By HOLLY WILLIAMS
Staff Reporter

 

Lloyd’s of Lexington may soon be
the only restaurant in this area to of-
fer 24-hour service to Washington
and Lee students.

Although Howard Johnson's is now
open around the clock, the hours will
be cut within the next month, and
Hardee’s in Buena Vista ended 24-
hour service about four months ago.

Economics is responsible for the
cut in Howard Johnson’s serving
hours. A manager who refused to
give his name said this week that re-
maining open was just not feasible
with the level of business.

‘‘We are paying workers more than
we are taking in,”’ he said.

The manager added that the motel-
restaurant’s location, (‘‘a little bit

social life in particular — is great.
However, after a while one needs to
“get out of town.’’ To go to a place
where there is no fear of ABC agents,
a place where one does not have to
deal with school work, a place where
the girls don’t snarl at others from
competing institutions.

But escapism is not the only reason
to visit D.C. It really is a good time.
New people abound — people who
won’t be by next Wednesday to put
their claws into you. The camara-
derie one finds with people you have
met, but don’t really know, is incredi-
ble. It is key to meet acquaintances
— they may get a lot friendlier than
in the confines of Lexington. And the
Mayflower may make for a better

out of town’) and too much competi-
tion from restaurants such as
Spanky’s and Lloyd’s are responsible
for the cut in hours.

A reduction of hours has become
more or less standard for Howard
Johnson’s Restaurants across the
country since the company was
bought out by Marriott Corp.

Hardee's cut its hours at the begin-
ning of the summer. Assistant man-
ager Sylvester Alexander said, ‘‘All I
can tell you is that service was slow
during the week, and during week-
ends there were too many kids on the
parking lot.”

He added that Hardee’s is planning
to resume 24-hour service on the
weekends, beginning this weekend,
but “I don’t want to say for sure.”’

Consequently Lloyd’s, on Washing-
ton Street — within walking distance
of campus, is the only remaining

time than Mr. Wayland’s on a cold
January evening.

Thus, it is easy to understand why
the streets of Georgetown are often
specked with W&L people. It is a
chance to get away from the monoto-
nous while having a good, exciting
time. D.C. is somewhat like a good
dream: you can go to a fun, great
new place while taking with you the
things that make you have fun and
leaving the ‘‘un-fun’’ behind. So if
school gets you down and you need a
change, head up to D.C. But don’t be
surprised to see some people that you
know. If If all goes well and the past
repeats, you will return to Lexington
and tell your friends, ‘‘I had the best
time.’’ And you will have.

Superdance committee
lists prizes, sells tickets

Tickets will go on sale this weekend
for the drawing for a 1986 Honda
hatchback that will be given away at
January’s Muscular Dystrophy As-
sociation Superdance.

Chances for the Jan. 25 raffle will
be available for $5 each at the en-
trance to Saturday’s football game.

Superdance co-chairman Sandy
Whann said the ticket price was quin-
tupled from the previously announc-
ed price because the committee “‘de-
cided that for a car, $1 was just too
small and there was no way we could
ever raise what we’d hoped for.”

Whann said the steering committee
hopes to raise close to $8,000 by sell-
ing more than 1,500 tickets. He said a
price of $10 was decided against be-
cause that would ‘‘miss the student
audience.”’

“That’s why it’s so important that we

A letter has been sent to fraternity
