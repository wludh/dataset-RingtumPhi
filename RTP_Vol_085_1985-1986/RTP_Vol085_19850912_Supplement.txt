Signs of the times

These four signs represent the new look to the Warner Center. ‘‘Women only” and
new directional signs have become de rigeur in the gymnasium.

Outlook ‘very positive,’ Rankin says

 

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

All systems are “‘go”’ for the
first year of women’s athletics
at Washington and Lee, accord-
ing to assistant athletic director
Cynda Rankin.

“Right now, it looks very
positive. There is no doubt that
we will field four teams (cross
country, swimming and diving,
golf and tennis). It’s mandated
by the NCAA,” Rankin said.

However, Rankin indicated,
‘We're not sure of the number
of women we have competing
yet.” She said 16 women took
athletic physicals during orien-
tation week.

“Obviously, I'd like larger
numbers. But I really think
there are women out there that
may be interested, but because
they’re freshmen, they just
haven’t stepped forward. Once
they get to know other students
that are participating or know a
little bit more about the pro-
gram, then they may be willing
to make a commitment,’’ Rank-
in said.

In April, Rankin said one of
her early goals was to get the
women’s program off to “as
healthy a start as it can.”’ That
start is looking promising,
Rankin said, noting that the
women she has met with are
very enthusiastic.

One of those interested
freshmen, Leann Flood, has set
her sights on being a member of

the first W&L women’s tennis
team. Flood said she is excited
at the opportunity and said she
believes the first teams can be
as good as the women make
them.

Because all the first-year
sports are non-team sports,
Rankin said, there is the oppor-
tunity for outstanding _ in-
dividuals to shine and therefore
bring success to the entire W&L
program.

“I believe there are in-
dividuals (among the freshman
women) that have the capabili-
ty of being successful,” she
said.

Rankin said that no team
sports have been decided upon
yet, but that some women have
expressed an interest in

volleyball. She said the in-
tramural program will be used
as an interest-testing mecha-
nism.

The four sports have schedul-
ed meetings for next week. All
interested women are encour-
aged to attend. Cross country
will meet Monday at 3:30 p.m.
in Room 516 of the Warner
Center. Swimming and diving
will meet Monday at 7 p.m. in
Cy Twombly Pool. Golf and ten-
nis are set to meet Tuesday at
7:30 p.m. in Room 516.

Rankin said the meetings will
give the athletic department a
better idea of which women are
participating. The meetings
will also give the fres en an idea
of what is expected of them as
intercollegiate athletes.

Changes

Warner Center has new look
to accommodate new students

 

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

 

“ENTRANCE WOMENS
LOCKER ROOM.”

Those words symbolically
and literally signal the effect of
the change to coeducation at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty. Nowhere on campus is the
change more evident than in the
Warner Center where renova-
tions were made t@ accommo-
date the incoming women.

The side entrance to the lock-
er rooms (the one that steps
down into the locker room) is
split at the entrance into two
doorways; the doorways lead-
ing to men’s and women’s
locker rooms. Because of the
change, the men’s locker room
is no longer connected to the
weight room. The former en-
trance to the men’s locker room
by the training room is now the
entrance to the women’s locker
room.

The weight room’s sole en-
trance is now beyond the IM of-
fice and Coach Verne Canfield’s
office. Other changes that are
not so obvious involve normal
additions of lockers to the team
locker rooms.

Coach Dick Miller, assistant
athletics director, explained
that these changes were very
simple and should accom-
modate women nicely.

Coach Miller added that four
intercollegiate sports will be
available to the women: tennis,
golf, sximming and cross coun-
try. Though this number may
be small to some, the number of
women’s sports will be deter-
mined by their interest. ‘‘Wo-
men have already contacted
members of the coaching staff,
expressing an interest in

athletic
Miller.

With reference to physical ed-
ucation courses, only one addi-
tion has been made and that is
P.E. 169: aerobic dance and ex-
ercise, The course, according to
Miller,”...is full, and we do
have some men in the class.”’

Essentially, the equipment
room will operate under the
same guidelines despite the
change to coeducation. Richard
“Chub” Yeakel regards the
coming year as “Business as
usual.”” He also stated, ‘This
year will be one of experimenta-
tion, but little change is really
anticipated.’’ The hours of the
gym and equipment room will
remain the same as last year.

The gym will be open from 7
a.m. until 10:30 p.m. Monday
through Saturday, and | p.m.
until 10:30 p.m. on Sunday. The
hours of the equipment room
are 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. Monday
through Friday. Tom Jones,
head trainer, also stipulated
that this year will be business
as usual. ‘‘Besides,”’ Jones said,
“e’ve been coed for years with
the law school, exchange stu-
dents, and women faculty.”

There is a female trainer in-
tern (Robin Rivers), similar to
years past, who will be assisting
Jones.

One other change to W&L ath-
letic facilities that is currently
underway is by the stadium
where a new women’s room is
being built. Also, ticket booths
are being made permanent.

Piranian: Attitude, talent are ‘great™

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

 

The 1985 Washington and Lee
soccer team lost six starters to
graduation, has only a few pro-
ven players and is coming off a
disappointing 6-8 campaign.
But Coach Rolf Piranian has
nothing but excitement in his
voice as he speaks about his
charges during early-season
workouts

“T’d say [ve enjoyed this
team already,” Piranian said.
“The guys seem to be having a
lot of fun. The amount of en-
thusiasm right now is a great
sign for the rest of the season.”’

In addition to that enthus-
iasm, Piranian said, the 1985
squad is laden with young
talent.

“There’s more pure soccer
talent on this team than before.
...1 feel pretty good that we will
put 11 skillful players on the
field.

But Piranian said he is not
putting any pressure on his
team: ‘‘We have a young team
that is going to have to develop
over time. I hope we will im-
prove in every game. The last
game should be the best game
of the season.”

Harriers: Better than

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

Last season, the Washington
and Lee men’s cross country
team scored a 14-0 regular sea-
son and an Old Dominion Athle-
tic Conference Championship.
It almost goes without saying
that this year’s squad has a
tough act to follow.

Now, try telling them that.

“IT think we’re going to the

nationals,” said sophomore
Richard Moore. ‘‘No doubt
about it.,’

One can hardly blame

Moore’s enthusiasm, though.

Consider this: the team has on-
ly lost one major runner, Frank
Pittman, who graduated last

 

 

 

 

The influx of talent has led
Piranian to change the W&L ap-
proach to the game. ‘“‘We’re go-
ing with an offense utilizing all
11 guys. We’re not going to be
counting on just two or three to
carry the team,” the nine-year
mentor said.

Although Piranian sees his
youngsters as talented, he
knows that leadership from his
few upperclassmen will be
vital. “I expect them to work
harder than anyone, to set the
example,” he said.

And that has been the case in
the early season workouts.
“There are not many upper-
classmen on the team, but the
upperclassmen we have are
role models, real standouts,”
the Generals’ mentor noted,
pointing specifically to the W&L
co-captains, senior forward Bill
Holmes and junior back Jim
Tucker.

The Generals’ combination of
leadership and talent will be
strongly tested in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.
Perennial conference powers
Lynchburg and Roanoke will
again field strong teams, Piran-
ian said.

The season opens at home for

year. This year’s probable team
leader, senior Eddie Goundry,
has been running 90 miles a
week. In addition, he has been
averaging a 32-minute ten kilo-
meters (a little over six miles).

“To win, everyone will have
to train and race as a unit,”
Miller continued. ‘‘We have a
lot of good returning veterans
and some promising freshmen
this year, so I am hopeful of a
successful season. However, it
is impossible for me to predict
how well we will do,” said
Miller. Miller was the 1984
ODAC Coach of the Year.

The team has been here on

son since September |, even

though their first meet isn’t

In addition to Moore and
Goundry, the team boasts a

including senior Ron Moody,
David Andrews and Ted

But despite the questions,
Piranian is confident in his
young players. “‘Some coaches

°85 gridders have plenty of power

 

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

 

The 1985 Washington and Lee
football Generals are much like a
game of Russian roulette. You
know the gun should fire, you just
don’t know when or, in the case of
the Generals, how often.

The offensive weapons are there
for the Generals as they begin the
1985 season. Head coach Gary
Fallon’s charges are looking to im-
prove on 1984’s 6-4 record and
fourth-place finish in the Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference. Another
winning season for W&L would tie a
school record of six consecutive
plus-.500 marks set by W&L teams
from 1919-1924.

The 1985 Generals return 36 let-
termen, a third of which are either
offensive backs or receivers.

That group includes a power-
house backfield of senior tri-captain
fullback Frank “John Riggins’’
Surface and junior Kevin Weaver.
Weaver and Surface check in at 6-3
and 6-2, respectively, are both over
200 Ibs., rushed for over 600 yeards
combined in 1984, and, according to
Fallon ‘‘can run over people.”’

“Tf we’re healthy, we have two of
the best backs in the league,”’ he
said.

Weaver, who played second fiddle
to Gene Girard last season, saw
double duty in 1984 as a linebacker
and was in on 47 tackles. However,
Fallon said that scenario is not in
the plans for ’85.

“Kevin is no longer a backup.
We’re going to have to find time to
rest this young man,”’ he said,
noting that a year ago it was troubl-
ing to leave an athlete such as
Weaver on the bench.

Getting the nod at the controls
will be junior Jon Thornton. Thorn-
ton, who was the W&L first string
QB for the majority of '84, has beef-
ed himself up, both physically and
mentally, according to Fallon.

“He’s really worked on his
game,”’ the W&L mentor said, in-
dicating that Thornton studied
films during the winter and is big-
ger and stronger than the 1984 ver-
sion. ‘If he has a great year, we do
also.”

Fallon said that while Thornton is
set as the starter, if need be, there
are capable reserves at the ready.
He pointed especially to an improv-
ed senior Bobby Wilson who battled
Thornton for the starting role. ‘‘If
John’s not having a good day, I feel
confident in putting in one of the
backups, and our kids know that,
too. It’s nice to have the talent that
we have,”’ Fallon explained.

Thornton will have a hoard of
eager receivers to throw to. At split
end, there are junior Randy Brown
and senior Hugh Finkelstein, while
at the tight end spot, junior John
Brownlee and sophomore Gar
Prebor are expected to share

duties, Seniors Chris Bleggi and
Lee Cummings will see action at the
slot back position. The six let-
termen accounted for more than
half of the Generals’ passing of-
fense a year ago.

In 1985, they should do even more.
Says Fallon, ‘‘Our receivesrs give

us something we haven't had be-
fore. We are not only able to beat so-
meone deep, but also are able to
beat them after we catch the ball.”

“We've got as fine a group of
receivers as this school has ever
had...We’re going to air it out,”’ said
Fallon, now in his eighth season at
W&L.

The major offensive question
mark for Fallon’s troops is with the
front line. Four of five starters were
lost from last season’s squad. Only
senior guard John Sanders returns.

But Fallon seems patient with his
young line composed of two soph-
omores, two juniors and Sanders on
the first team and five freshmen
backing them up. ‘‘We hope we’re
not going to be asking things of our
line that they’re not capable of,” he
said. ‘Hopefully, we’ll be able to
keep our opponents off balance.”

Fallon was especially pleased
with the line’s preseason progress,
noting that sophomore John Pack-
ett should be a force at 6-4, 260 Ibs.

Defensively, the Generals return
all four starters in the secondary
from a year ago. Fallon said the
Fearsome Foursome of seniors
Kelvin Newsome and Scott Hender-
son (defensive backs) and Tim
Janyska and Chris Wilson
(safeties) may be the best secon-
dary against the run in the ODAC,

“The pass is something that
needs to be worked on,” Fallon
said, But he said that the seniors’
experience should make up for any
speed they are lacking on pass
coverage.

In addition to the senior secon-
dary, three other veterans (junior
linebackers Bob Berlin and B.J.
Sturgill, and senior tri-captain and
tackle Alex Castelli) return up
front.

Joining Castelli on the front line
are junior Jim Murphy at an end,
and sophomores John Johnston
(end), Jay Gorlowski (tackle) and
John Nozemack (nose guard). The
five combined for 115 tackles last
year.

The W&L kicking game suffered
a big loss when James White,
W&L’s all-ODAC placekicker in
1984, was unable to return to the
squad because of a recurring high
school leg injury. But Fallon be-
lieves Sturgill will fill in adequately
for White.

“When you lose a James White,
you swallow hard. But B.J. has
come along well,’ Fallon said. He
said that freshman Tom Skeen will
share the punting responsibilities
with Sturgill.

The Generals open their season
Saturday on the road against
Emory and Henry. Fallon said he is
expecting a stern challenge, but
says his charges are ready.

“I think one of our strongest
points is our attitude and en-
thusiasm,”’ he said, noting that the
players voluntary participation in
the W&L Barbell Club during the
winter is an indication of that en-
thusiasm.

“We know the problems we’re
facing.... 1 don’t think any adversity
is going to faze this group.”’

Game 1

Wasps could be nuisances (again)

 

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

 

 

Emory and Henry has been a
thorn in the side of Washington and
Lee football since 1983, and the
Wasps figure to be just as difficult
in the Generals’ opener Saturday
afternoon in Emory, Va.

“This is a tough opener,” W&L
head coach Gary Fallon said, in-
dicating that his inexperienced of-
fensive line will face one of the best
defensive fronts in the conference.

The opener may be even tougher
than originally expected. Although
junior Kevin Weaver is listed as a
tentative starter for the game, he
injured his knee in Saturday’s Blue-
White game, according to Fallon.
Fallon said the injury has been a
“day to day kind of thing.”

Weaver said Wednesday after-
noon that the injury was “‘just a lit-
tle bump, nothing major.” Asked if
he expects to play in Saturday’s
game, Weaver replied, ‘‘Yeah,
hopefully.”

The Washington and Lee rugby
club has built a reputation as a
group of hard-nosed gentlemen who
tackle their opponents with almost
as much zest as they tackle their
post-game refreshments.

As the 1985-86 season approaches,
that reputation may take on the ad-
ded quality of being one of the
state’s best rugby clubs.

Senior Bill Jones, who serves as a
player and a coach for the W&L
ruggers, sees a veteran squad re-
turning to Lexington. ‘We got
everybody coming back,” Jones
said.

That crew includes club president
Dave Arthur, one of the team’s
scoring leaders, as well as last spr-
ing’s team leaders, P.J. lerardi and
Chris Komosa. Ierardi and Komosa
took over the reins in the spring
while Jones and Arthur spent the
semester abroad.

The Generals finished the spring
campaign with a 5-4 record, the
third winning season in two years
for W&L rugby. (Rugby has sepa-
rate seasons in the fall and spring of
each year.)

Nevertheless, the return of Ar-
thur and Jones is very welcome.
“With us there, it sort of coor-
dinates everything,’’ Jones said, in-
dicating that he and Arthur taught
most of the present members of the
club the ins and outs of the game.

The host of upperclassmen has

 

Jones setting sights on a possible
state championship this fall. ‘‘We
have a good chance this year, the

Jim Murdock, head trainer for
the football team, had no comment
on the extent of Weaver’s injury.

The knee was to be examined to-
day by a Lexington orthopedic
surgeon.

The Wasps are not without injury
woes, either. Starting quarterback
Gary Collier played hurt in last
Saturday’s loss to Ferrum. E&H
head coach Lou Wacker said Collier
is not yet 100 percent and is ‘‘still
not agile as we'd like him to be.”’

E&H will be looking to rebound
from last weekend’s opener. The
Wasps were beaten by a late-game
Ferrum touchdown, 15-8.

“Ferrum beat them, but then
Ferrum is a tough football team,”
Fallon warned.

The Wasps have the most return-
ing lettermen of any team in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference and
are seen as a very real threat to
steal the crown from defending
champion Randolph-Macon. E&H
returns 44 lettermen, the most of

best chance in the last four years,”’
the senior said.

The road to the state champion-
ship will feature matches with VMI,
Virginia Tech, James Madison,
Mary Washington, the Roanoke
Men’s Rugby Club and the Lynch-
burg Men’s Rugby Club. Unlike
previous years, Jones added, the
W&L ruggers will be matched
against strictly the ‘A’ sides of op-
posing teams. The season’s focal
point will be in October at the state
championship tournament.

 

any team in the ODAC. The 44
veterans include 17 starters.

Coach Lou Wacker sees the ad-
vantages and burdens of having so
much going for his team. ‘‘They
know they have to come through.
It’s put up or shut up time,’’ E&H’s
fourth-year mentor said.

“This early in the season, the
team that can adjust quickly during
the game will do reasonably well,”
Wacker said.

The W&L game poses a special
problem, Wacker said. “‘Our big-
gest concern is that we have to
prepare for the unknown,”’ he said,
indicating that the same was true in
the Ferrum where the Wasps were
confronted with some unexpected
things from their opponents.

Defensively, E&H will be a force
with nine starters returning. They
are led by Division III all-America
defensive back Mike Lindsay, who
hauled in eight interceptions last
year, Only the cornerback slot was
hurt by graduation as both 1984

With the most successful club
program in recent years at W&L
the question naturally comes to
mind, ‘‘Why doesn’t the rugby club
seek varsity status?’ Jones ex-
plained that while the increased
funding would be most welcome,
rugby is played primarily on the
club level in college.

But despite his optimism, Jones
cited a couple of trouble areas for
the W&L ruggers. His squad lacks
some depth and Jones says the key
is to attract a large number of

starters were seniors.

On offense, Collier has both a
capable backfield and a number of
fine receivers. Last week, Collier
was less than stellar, however,
completing nine of 23 attempts and
throwing one interception. Junior
Sandy Rogers led all rushers with
56 yards on 13 carries.

“We are very respectful of
Emory and Henry,” Fallon said.
“Offensively, they can mix it up by
using options, a power running at-
tack, play action or by passing.
Defensively, they should really test
us. They are aggressive and well-
coached.”’

Saturday’s game will be the 15th
meeting of the two schools. The
Wasps lead the series, 8-46. The
Generals suffered their only
shutout of 1984 when the Wasps ex-
ploded for 28 second-half points to
beat W&L, 28-0.

Kickoff is set for 1:30 p.m. The
gam will be broadcast live in the
Lexington area by WLUR-FM
(91.5).

“We need people, freshmen, in
particular. We’re going to lose a lot
of players this year,’ he said, in-
dicating that anyone interested in
the club should report to the first
practice on the law school field on
Tuesday.

Another obstacle facing the squad
is one faced by every squad in the
pre-season: getting in shape. ‘‘No-
body’s in shape,” Jones said. ‘‘If we
can get in shape, I think we’ll do
really well.”

 

 

 
 

 

TIME OUT & SPORTS SHORTS
The bad, the bad, the bad and the good

.... The other day one of my
friends told me to go to hell.
“That's okay,” I replied,
“I’m already there.”’

“Come again?”

“I'm a Pirates fan.”
eal “Oh, I’m sorry.”’

4 Indeed, it has been a long

Mike Stachura summer. But then again it

was one filled with its in-

teresting tidbits or gaping wounds that made you swear

off ESPN for a couple of weeks. A number of things hit
me, most of them in the wrong way

¢ Headlines like ‘It’s baseball vs. drugs today.”

Remember when ‘vs.’ went with words like ‘‘Washing-
ton” and ‘‘Dallas’’? But then this is the 1980s and ideas
like that are as misplaced as believing in sportsmanship
and having faith in our professional athletes as role
models. It's a good thing ‘‘we don’t need another hero,”’
because there probably aren:t anymore....

¢ Money changes everything.

It seems the summer of 1985 was big on professional
athletes and money problems. The baseball strike is a fine
example of how the almighty dollar has replaced the ball,
bat or racquet as an athlete’s most important tool. Don’t
these guys make enough money? Sure, there’s the philoso-
phy that says they’re entitled to all they can get. But
campers, you can’t run the railroad that way, because
pretty soon every two bit coal-shoveler is going to be ask-
ing for as much as Casey Jones makes.

Someday, let us hope, those in professional sports will
join the rest of us who have outgrown the ‘“‘Me Genera-
tion.”’ Should a strike come up again, however, how about
just replacing the disgruntled prima donnas with some of
those eager to get a shot at playing. Send a message to the
strikers that they’re not missed.

¢ Invasion of the Holdouts.

Perhaps worse than any distaste the strike could have
caused is the phenomenon with us as the NFL season be-
gins: the holdout. Kind of sounds like the aftermath of a
nuclear holocaust. Indeed.

  

   

What’s scary and/or silly is that these holdouts
(mutants?) are getting off scot-free. John Riggins got the
starting nod for the Redskins, as did Touchdown Danny
Marino. (But then again, Danny personified the term
“hurtin’ QB” — we’re not talking injury here — on Sun-
day). No matter that they missed the heat and hard work
of training camp. And frankly, the owners and coaches
have their hands tied. Eric Dickerson can sit back, eat
potato chips and dip, and watch MTV until the Rams come
begging for him. And if the Rams don’t come begging for
him, they’ve lost half their offense.

Solution: I know if I went 38 days without showing up for
work, and then casuaily strolled in, I wouldn’t find a job
waiting for me. Why should it be different for these guys?

 

‘ If your job is
bagging groceries,
you bag groceries... ’

 

determine whether there is suf-

Hey, there’s no free agency at Kroger’s. If your job is bag-
ging groceries, you bag groceries, or you have no job. If
your job is playing football, you play football, or you have
no job.

And then there was some good news.

Finally, there were a couple of good things happening
sportswise this summer. The NCAA has finally realized
that college is more than Saturday afternoons on the field
or in the gym. The stern attitude and their ability to carry

’ out that attitude are to be applauded. Let’s hope they even

get tougher.... And speaking of tough, Pete Rose, love him
or hate him, you have to tip your hat to the record break-
er. But then you can tip your hat to him with or without the
record...

.... Let’s go to the Colonnade for just a quick look at

  

6

what’s happening this early in September. First, a special
wish of good fortune to the maiden voyage of women’s
sports at W&L. Let’s not look for any titles immediately.
And let’s also hope the participants don’t get down on
themselves if they’re not showered with early success. All
of us learn to walk before we can run... On the men’s side,
football has the firepower to hurt anybody; soccer seems
to have a super attitude, and I look for great things from
this group; cross country has a tall order to repeat as con-
ference champs and will have to benefit from steady
performances from a very deep squad; and water polo is a
likely candidate for the most successful group of them
all...

...Hey, so how about that non-U.S, Open? Yankees
came up with just one title during their home event
(Robert Seguso and Ken Flach in the men’s doubles), and
that one was questionable. Don’t look now, but the world is
catching up with us... A Spinks’ win in that mega-buck
match-up with Larry Holmes would sure be a treat, and
it’s not all that unlikely, especially since the champ has
said the $3 million he’s guaranteed for the Spinks fight is
more important than his run at Marciano’s record....

....Here’s some guesses at who's going to win the NFL:
L.A. Raiders, Steelers, Dolphins (by default), Seattle,
everybody but Philly in the NFC East, Minnesota, and the
49ers... In college: Your guess is as good as mine, but Bo
Jackson will own the Heisman, and don’t be surprised if
one of the runners-up is UCLA’s FG man John Lee....

....And a new weekly feature: The USA Today (in Tech-
nicolor and/or Sensurround) Gaffe of the Week: Only The
Mickey Mouse Gazette could have a grotesque hybrid
graphic of the universal best body in sports (Jan Stephen-
son for best chest!) and call it *Must Reading*. Anyone

....Hey, in parting, a suggestion: Since ol’ Doremus has
been renovated, it’s a hike guys-wise from the weight
room to the water fountain. If possible, this oversight
should be corrected.....

P.S.: Word has it WLUR will broadcast a number of away
football games this fall beginning this Saturday with the
E&H game. A good idea and worth a listen....

WATER POLO

 

H,O Polo could be
one of East’s best

 

By LEIF UELAND
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
Generals are a team full of
potential that could materialize
as one of the East’s top water
polo teams,

The team finished 18-14-1 last
year but failed to win the
Southern Conference
Championship for the first time
in four seasons.

There is every indication
though, that that could be im-
proved upon. The team could
win its Southern Conference
championship and make an im-
pressive showing in the Eastern
Championships.

In addition to nine returning
lettermen (including all of last
year’s starters, except for Bob-
by Pearson, who graduated),
the team has a bumper crop of
16 freshmen.

Coach Page Remillard real-
izes he has the best of both
worlds.

“We intend to capitalize on
our depth and experience and
benefit from a very good
recruiting year. We have a good
nucleus of talented veterans
who know our system and who
understand situational water
polo. I am optimistic about the
potential of this particular
group of athletes. They could
take a quantum leap in the level
at which they play.”

Though whatever success the
Generals do encounter will un-
doubtedly stem from a team ef-
fort, certain key individuals —
including All-American Tim
Stanford — are sure to make
their presence known.

“He [Stanford] is an incredi-

ble athlete who has worked
himself into a great water polo
player.”’

Sophomore Simon Perez, who
only began playing last year,
and junior Kevin Lederer are
also likely to make a healthy
contribution to the team effort.

In the crucial position of
goaltender will be returning
starter, junior Marty Radvany.

Among promising freshmen
are high school teammates
David Reavy and David Dietz of
Pennsylvania, and Christian
Westergaard of California.

The players, the majority of
whom have been practicing for
two weeks, 84 hours a day, will
open their season at home this
Friday through Sunday in the
W&L Fall Classic at W&L’s
Twombly Pool.

Eight teams will participate
in the tournament, including the
University of Richmond, the
University of Arkansas (Little
Rock), The University of North
Carolina (Wilmington), Dayton
University, Johns Hopkins
University, Lynchburg College,
and two W&L teams.

Richmond, rated No. 18 na-
tionally in the latest polls, won
the tournament last year. W&L
finished fourth.

With the nine returning let-
termen and the group of fresh-
men, W&L’s prior performance
is likely to be improved upon.

Though the season is still in
its infant stages, players
already cite a change in their
attitude and Remillard’s. While
Remillard last year was con-
cerned with giving Richmond a
good fight, this year the concern
is actually beating Richmond,
players say.
