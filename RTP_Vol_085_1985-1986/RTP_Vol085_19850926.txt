Atwood, Simpson leaving deanships

C-School head plans return
to classroom after year’s leave

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Executive Editor

Edward C. Atwood, dean of the
School of Commerce, Economics and
Politics, will leave that position June
30 and return to teaching after a one-
year leave of absence, the University
announced this week.

“I’m tired of being a dean,’’ a shirt-
sleeved Atwood said with a smile
Tuesday. ‘‘I’m about ready to quit.”

University President John D. Wil-
son announced the change to the
Commerce School faculty Thursday
afternoon and on Monday sent a let-
ter about it to all faculty members.

Wilson said in the letter that ‘“‘it

will be impossible to find a successor
to match [Atwood’s] faithful and car-
ing service to the students and facul-
ty of the School and of the larger Uni-
versity.”

A search committee for a replace-
ment is now being formed.

Atwood, 62, began his Washington
and Lee career in 1952 as an econo-
mics professor and served as dean of
students from 1962 to 1969, when he
was appointed to his present position.

He said he chose to step down after
this year because he has a year of ad-
ministrative leave coming to him and
only two more years of tenure, which
ends at age 65.

The dean said that by taking the
leave now and then teaching for a

‘Animalism’ cited
in effort by faculty

to tighten

By JASON LISI
Siaff Reporter

 

 

The disciplinary policy that took ef-
fect this year was enacted because
the faculty was “‘sick and tired of the
animalism that goes on on this cam-
pus,’’ law Professor Roger D. Groot
told the Executive Committee Mon-
day.

Groot, who served on last year’s
Drug Policy Review Committee and
drafted much of the new code, said
the feeling among professors last
year was, “‘Let’s put our foot down
and stop it.”

The EC invited Groot to address
the meeting in response to concern
by members about the section desig-
nating the use of racial or sexual
slurs as a major disciplinary offense.

Groot defended the policy, noting
that ‘‘there were some who wanted to
make it stricter.”’

He said the committee’s report was
“not hasty and not secret.”’

“There may have been folks not
paying attention, but it was widely
disseminated last spring,” he said.

The committee was quite careful,
Groot said, to avoid blurring the
jurisdictions of the EC and the SCC.

“That came up at almost every
meeting: ‘Will this impinge on the
Honor System?’ and we’d work it
around so that it wouldn’t,’’ he ex-
plained.

Groot noted that ‘tan honorable
person is not necessarily a gentle-
man.”

“If you want to take jurisdiction
over what’s gentlemanly, then I think
that you folks have some real pro-
blems,”’ he said.

discipline

In pointing out that the EC itself
limits the scope of its authority,
Groot noted the committee tradition-
ally does not prosecute students who
steal roadsigns or use false identifi
cation cards.

“One is theft and the other is
fraud,” he said.

Groot said the slurs provision
would still allow students to ‘‘sit
around in your room and tell ethnic
jokes.”’

The section defines the offense as
“use of racial, ethnic, religious or
sexual slurs directly to an individual
or identifiable group and intended to
degrade or dehumanize the recipient
of the slur.”

Junior representative Shayam
Menon asked: ‘‘Professor Groot,
have you every been to a fraternity
party?”

‘No, I haven’t,”’ the law professor
replied.

“It’s kind of scary when many peo-
ple make these comments that a stu-
dent could get kicked out for that,”
Menon said.

‘You say there’s so much of this
that goes on,’’ Groot responded.
“‘Let’s stop it.”

‘Please don’t think I’m condoning
it,’’ Menon said.

President John Lewis asked how
the EC could get the policy changed.

‘‘T don’t think you can,"’ Groot said.

‘How would we try?’’ Lewis per-
sisted.

“T think you’d have to go to the
trustees,’’ the law professor respond-
ed.

Lewis brought the lengthy discus-
sion to an end by saying: ‘“‘We’re
beating a horse here, guys — a dead
one.”

still will teach

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela H. Simpson, who played a
key role in making coeducation a
reality at Washington and Lee, will
return to full-time teaching at the end
of this academic year, she said
yesterday.

She said Dean of the College John
W. Elrod will announce her successor
at the Oct. 7 faculty meeting.

Simpson, a fine arts professor who
joined the faculty in 1973, was named
assistant dean in 1981 and was pro-
moted to associate dean in 1983. She
said her five years in the position
falls right between the four- and six-
year terms of her two immediate pre-
decessors.

Rush has been a ‘great experience,’
several Washington and Lee women interviewed this

premonitions, because everyone was so nice.”’

Elizabeth Smith agreed. ‘‘I feel like the girls that
either didn’t go or canceled out at the last minute really

missed out on a lot of fun,”’ she said.

“It made it seem like we were part of the freshman

Between now and Saturday even
ing, about 145 leading theologians,
ethicists, philosophers, lawyers,
physicians and ministers from
Canada, Puerto Rico, South Africa
and across the United States will be
on campus. Their purpose: to discuss
what religion Professor Harlan Beck
ley calls “‘the most important work
since Reinhold Niebuhr’s 40 years
previously.”’

The book, ‘‘Ethics from a Theocen
tric Perspective’ by James M. Gus
tafson, is the radical idea of one man
dissatisfied with society's view of
ethics and theology

Gustafson, professor of theological
ethics at the University of Chicago,
asks individuals to look beyond
themselves and their communities,
beyond this generation and even
beyond the human race, Beckley said
this week

Gustafson's two-volume book says
society must move from a human
oriented religious and moral life to

clude us in the Rush dates because we get to know the
upperclassmen in a different way from a class or a par-

nternational panel of scholars gathers here to talk ethics

one with God at the center, said
Beckley, who has helped organize the
event.

Saturday at 3 p.m., Gustafson will
respond to eight of the nine speakers
scheduled for the three-day symposi-
um, which is co-sponsored by the In-
stitute for the Advanced Study of Re-
ligion at Chicago University Divinity
School and by the Department of Re-
ligion at Washington and Lee.

Robert N. Beilah, Ford professor of
sociology and comparative studies
and vice chairman of the Center for
Japanese Studies at the University of
California at Berkeley, is one scholar
scheduled to speak. Bellah will pre-
sent his paper, “Gustafson as Critic
of Culture,’ Friday at7:30 p.m

will discuss ‘*The Paradox of Human-
ism" Saturday morning at 11. Mid-
gley retired as senior lecturer in phil-
osophy at the University of Newcas-
tle in 1980

OPINION
Responsibility

As the budget process begins again and the Executive
Committee pleads poverty (as oft the refrain may be heard),
organizations will plead their cases and proposals. Important
lessons need to be learned and questions need to be answered
before any money is doled out. Both the EC and the student
body need to pay careful attention to this year’s budget pro-
cess as decisions are made regarding next year’s student
taxes.

This year, more organizations than ever before have asked
the EC for student body funds. Existing organizations,
almost without exception, have begged the EC for more
funds than they received last year. And the EC, for the sec-
ond year in a row and for only the second time in W&L’s
history, is confronted with nearly a $2,500 budget deficit from
last year that must be paid before any new money can be
distributed.

We can learn some valuable lessons in distributing money
from the past years. Last year, the EC decided to allot to the
Student Bar Association a percentage of the student budget
based on the number of enrolled law students and the approx-
imate time law students participated in other traditionally
undergraduate organizations. The EC asked the SBA to be
judicious in its budgeting and required no monthly or quar-
terly reports from them. (The SBA president last year, how-
ever, provided the EC with periodic updates on the status of
the SBA budget.) The system seemed to work well except for
one minor hitch.

In its Sept. 16 issue, The W&L Law News told of the
Women’s Law School Organization, which last year had
received the largest increase in budgeted funds of any law
organization. The group sponsored one seminar of specific in-
terest for women law students on divorce law with their stu-
dent body funds. At the end of the year, like most organiza-
tions, they realized that the budget surplus they held would
not look good if it were returned. How to spend the surplus?
Hold a banquet, of course, and let the members enjoy the
meal at no cost.

Rightfully, then-SBA President John Sicilian vetoed the
plan before the group had a chance to spend the money. But
the situation brings to the surface many questions that need
to be addressed as organizations at the Law School and the
undergraduate level go on their knees begging for money.

Foremost, the EC ought to remember the purpose of each
organization and the agenda each proposes. Will the organi-
zation be open to all students? Does it attempt to limit those
interested by the activities it sponsors?

Secondly, the EC needs to continue the frequent budget
reports it has required of all organizations in past years.
Strict accountability can mean dollars better spent by
organizations with need. ee

Lastly, the EC needs to recognize that many organizations
will inflate their budgets in order to obtain a fraction of their
request. (That fraction will be what they really wanted to
begin with, but they won’t admit it.) Many organizations go
before the EC with bare budgets and have them slashed to
pieces because larger organizations with little propensity to
budget, save or cut corners need their fat budgets to accom-
modate their hefty ‘“‘needs.’’ Being honest in a request should
not hurt an organization.

With the EC beginning the year having to pay for last
year’s deficit, organizations need to pay closer attention to
their dollars. The EC should scrutinize the requests it
receives and the spending plans proposed. We hope that EC
Vice President Andrew Caruthers holds true to his word and
does not allow another year of deficit spending.

At Davidson College, they pick up dirty laundry outside
dorm doors in the morning and return it by evening all wash-
ed and ironed. Here, laundry piles up in the corner until it is
old enough to walk out by itself. Then it’s time to “Shout it
out.”’

But this year, doing laundry has taken on a new meaning.
Forget ring-around-the-collar. The problem is ring-around-
the-quad. The long wait to get into the laundry room in the
basement of Graham-Lees can be just that — long. Never
mind that, once there, only one of the five machines is work-
ing. Just to be there is an accomplishment.

While there are other laundromats in Lexington, students,
especially freshmen, should not have to cart their clothing
around town to get it washed. Nor should the machine
operators be content in knowing that demand is much
greater than their five machines can handle.

Overcrowding is a problem, and it has a simple solution.
The laundry room is large enough to house a few more
machines. A little work on the plumbing and a few extra
wires for the additional circuits could end the backup. And
just think — no more ring-around-the-quad.

Rules are killing honor and tradition

To the Editors:

When General Lee was president of
Washington College, a new student
asked him for a copy of the rules.
“There are no rules,’ the General
replied. ‘“‘Everyone is expected to
behave as a gentleman.’’ Beginning
this year, after more than 100 years,
this is no longer the case. You will
find most of our new rules on page 11
of your new Student Handbook, under
“Offenses.’’ The other rule, which is
not written, but which is implicit in
the written ones, goes something like
this: ‘“‘No act is dishonorable, except
for certain instances of lying, cheat-
ing, and stealing, which shall be
punished in most cases by expul-
sion.”

Over the past few weeks, a number
of students, myself included, have
been generating a certain amount of
heat over these new rules, heat which
we have directed mainly against the
faculty, who enacted them. In this, I
am not certain that we have been en-
tirely fair. While we students may be
justly chagrined by the faculty’s
decision to void the first part of the
General’s famous dictum, we must, I
deeply feel, face the fact that we
have brought this action upon our-
selves. For we students have our-
selves voided the second, and vital,
part of our founder’s precept: We no
longer act, nor expect one another to
act, as ladies and gentlemen.

I do not write as a shocked mora-
list, deploring the shameful behavior
of my fellow students, although I am
shocked by some of it, and do deplore
it. Nor do I wish to commit the
heinous crime of “imposing my
morals” on anyone else, although I
might wish that with some morals. I
write, rather, as a lover of this
University, an admirer of its
founders, and a true believer in
honor.

Perhaps I state the case too strong-
ly. I certainly still believe in honor,
and I am sure that many others do.
Yet we see that the bookstore has
ceased to accept a student’s word
alone in giving credit, at least partly
because some students were charg-
ing books to other people’s accounts;
we see that WLUR no longer allows
programmers to bring their own
records to the station, at least partly
because more records were going out
than were coming in; we see the theft
of road signs condoned by an officer
of the Executive Committee (’’Boys
will be boys’); we see that among
the illustrious alumni of this universi-
ty, we must now honor felons and
thieves along with jurists and states-
men; and week after week we see
drunkenness, brawling and debauch-
ery that would have enraged General
Lee. (A certain fraternity, founded
on this campus, still claims to be
dedicated to the principles exhibited
by the life of that great man. I think if
he could see one of its parties, he
would decline the honor.) Last
contained a_ fine
commentary on the state of the
“W&L Gentleman,” although the edi-
torialist found it more important to
mourn the loss of romantic evenings
on the moonlit Colonnade. How many
“W&L Gentlemen” were arrested
over the summer? How many have
been arrested since classes resum-
ed? Ndw ask, how many of those will
be accused of dishonorable conduct?
To how many of them shall we say;
“You have betrayed our trust and
tarnished our name; you do not
deserve the honor of a Washington
and Lee diploma?”’

An honor system is not primarily a
means of enforcing discipline. It is a
way of life, whose adherent says, ‘‘I
shall strive to be honest in all things,
but not only honest: I shall do my
best to be kind, to be courteous, to be
brave; to respect authority and chal-
lenge wrongdoing. I shall harm no
one willingly, and shall help whom |

can. Inall I doand am, I shall work to
be worthy of my fellows’ trust and
honor, not because I fear some penal-
ty for failure, or hope for some
reward, but because right and duty
and love of fellowman will let me live
no other way.’’ Enforcement comes
only when one among us violates
those principles so grossly that we
can no longer tolerate his presence.

Rules are prescribed expressly for
the enforcement of discipline. They
demonstrate the failure of an honor
system. An honor system that is re-
duced to prescribed rules, as ours
seems now to be, is not an honor
system but an obedience system — a

set of rules like any other, regardless
of the single sanction and Executive
Committee talk of ‘‘honor.”’

If all this talk of duty and virtue
sounds archaic, I make no apologies.
Honor is archaic. It is ancient. But I
refuse to believe that it is obsolete,
though this society abandon it. The
honor of Washington and Lee calls us
not merely to be no worse than the
world around us: It calls us to a
higher standard, to be not merely
honest but virtuous. If our cherished
system is to survive, we students
must enforce it. But far more impor-
tantly, we must live it. If we will live
by that high unwritten code, and
guard it jealously from those who

would pull it down, the faculty’s new
rules will be irrelevant. If we will
prove ourselves to be honorable men
and women, we can rightly demand
the rules’ repeal. If not, we need the
rules. If we are unwilling to govern
ourselves by General Lee’s directive,
we do not deserve an honor system
and will not have one, whatever we
may call our set of rules. If we are no
longer willing to dedicate ourselves
to honor, let us at least be honest: Let
us throw away our White Books, and
bury the Honor System with its
founder.

Markham piles it onto ‘Nelpat’

Dear Mike and the boys:

Since John Randolph died, there
has been none so much as the under-
signed who could claim unchallenged
a conservative reputation. My
motives are not open to suspicion on
this count: I am hardly a liberal
frontman. It was therefore with con-
siderable fury I read, on the same
page, the carping of NelPat and the
whine of Chris Carter. Both, I note,
call themselves conservatives. If
either were, it would be the most
disastrous thing for conservatism
since Jenevein.

Now, I’m known as an even-tem-
pered man: I stay mad. But not this
hot, generally. It takes the sancti-
monious bleating of the sons of
stablehands for that. Mr. Patterson’s
editorial was in the main no more
notably illiterate or muddle-headed
than usual. But then he raises again
the matter of the new name for the
University pub. In so doing, he takes
a coward’s swipe at the integrity of
the most generous and honest man I
know here: Mr. Darrell. It has been
my privilege to work with that
gentleman for four years. In that
time, I have found no more honest
soul. Mr. Patterson insinuates, in his
usual reptilian fashion (but then, is
he not a snake handler of old?), that
Mr. Darrell lied in his explanation of
the reasons for the name change
Well, we always knew NelPat was in-
educable; but has he learned nothing
of honor in four years? Mr. Darrell is
perfectly accurate in pointing out
that the change is one of economic
survival. Mr. Patterson’s vicious clip
on the play earns him again my nom-
ination for being caned or whipped
with a quirt on the Chapel steps. I will
allow him a week for the retraction,
and it had better, by God, be forth-
coming. And I suggest that he refrain
from further error. 1 know not where
was pious Nelson when Mr. Darrell
was the necessary pillar of the
Muscular Dystrophy fundraising ef-
fort; but NelPat can at least see the
man is (inevitably) his better, and
should act accordingly.

This new spirit of partisan mean-
ness is disturbing in NelPat’s little
scribble. It is equally damnable in
the sniveling of young Carter. The
two between them are a pair of cas-
trated (gelded, if you'd rather) jack-
asses, braying back and forth to little
point. Last week, for the first time in
my five years’ memory, Nelson
made (albeit poorly) some worthy
points. Mr. Carter has chosen to ob-
ject to the tone only and not the
substance, and has invoked tone
himself. He who lives by criticism of
form and attempts thereby to mis-
direct the debate, having no better
answer, must prepare to die by the
sword. Damn them both for unctious
sons of sotten oversees.

We have coeducation; none fought
it as did I. But we alumni, being at
least older and in these two cases

tend that it work now that we have it.
Mr. Patterson sees the NOW under
every bed (which may be adolescent
wishfulness). Mr. Carter suggests
abject surrender to the excesses of
modernity. Considering the source, it
is no surprise both are wrong. The ex-
ample is, as always, Lee’s: Make the
old enlighten the new, and make the
new to work. The spirit abroad here,
as these two show it, is conducive on-
ly to recrimination. It is the spirit of

the new disciplinary code, that com-
bination of leftist ideological frippery
and law-and-order statism. It is the
neo-abolition spirit. In all three
guises, it must be crushed. Let us see
toit.

EC rep’s comment on dorms
shows the absurdity of it all

 

MY VIEW
By Tom Maguire

 

Last week’s issue of The Ring-tum
Phi presented an interesting contrast
between the sometimes make-be-
lieve world of Executive Committee
opinion and the reality of Washington
and Lee student life.

In a front-page article, sophomore
EC Representative Pat Schaefer was
quoted as expressing concern over a
new rule requiring dorm counselors
to notify the dean’s office if a
freshman younger than the legal
drinking age possesses beer. Accord-
ing to Schaefer, this presents ‘‘a very
dangerous situation.”’

A little further down on the front
page, an article appeared describing
the after-effects of partying in the
freshman dorms. The picture one got
from the article was of buildings
laden with hung-over zombies and
smelling of vomit and stale beer.

After reading both articles, I was a
little saddened that so few people
could enjoy their first taste fo the
relative freedom afforded by attend-
ing college without getting drunk.

Soon, however, the absurdity of the
two articles hit me. Why should Pat
Schaefer, or anyone else for that
matter, be worried about the new
rules for dorm counselors? Obvious-
ly, those rules are never going to be
enforced,

First, most dorm counselors (and
mind, I said most, not all) don’t
spend that much time in the dorms.
This is hardly surprising. Dorm
counselors are juniors or seniors, and
their friends don’t live in the dorms.
Also, the freshman dorms are noisy
places as a rule, and thus not con-
ducive to the heavy studying done by
many dorm counselors, who tend to
have good academic records.

Second, most dorm counselors
aren’t that aware of every little thing
going on in their halls. They just
don’t know who put what in their

altogetiic: aii uidcou awe state of af-
fairs. Any dorm counselor who was
familiar with the contents of his or
her charges’ cupboards would be
more like Big Brother than a counse-
lor and friend, and would thus elimi-
nate some of the freedom we present-
ly enjoy as W&L students.

Finally, no one likes to think that
their job description includes the
word ‘‘fink.”’ However, dorm counse-
lors presently are requested to act as
snitches. No dorm counselor with any
sense of loyalty to a fellow student
would turn him or her in to the dean
over the trifling amount of time stan-
ding between the student and the
legal drinking age.

The present situation is not, as Pat
Schaefer would have us believe,
“dangerous.” Rather, it is ludicrous.
It is a rare occasion when I disagree
with our administration, but here,
clearly, it is wrong.

The more I think about it the more
Iam convinced that the enforcement
of the drinking age is none of the
school’s business. Since when does a
University do police work? Certainly
the GHQ (nee Cockpit) should proof
patrons before serving them alcohol,
Otherwise, the school should leave
the enforcement of the alcohol laws
to the state, which so wisely passed
the 21 drinking age bill in the first
place, and which is admirably equip-
ped to deal with violations of this, or
any other, law,

Currently, our administration is at
the nadir of its popularity in my four
years of residence here. This state of
affairs is both unfortunate and, |
think, undeserved. However, ‘‘the
Hill” does itself no credit when it in-
sists upon a policy that is unworkable
and just plain wrong. It is unfair to
the dorm counselors, and unfair to
many of the students, who are paying
for an education, not baby-sitting.

The administration would do well
to act quickly, and thus put an end to
further friction on this issue, this
year and in the future. One memo
rescinding one section of the dorm
counselors instructions would save a

An independent’s choice
called difficult but important

 

By CHUCK DIFFENDERFFER

 

What is the experience of the
Washington and Lee independent?
What are the reasons for an indepen-
dent being an independent? Does it
hold any advantages and disadvan-
tages? What avenues are open to the
W&L independent? If any of these
questions intrigue you, please con-
tinue reading; if none of this interests
you, keep reading anyway in hopes of
finding a grammatical error.

Most independents are such by
choice, according to a 1979 study,
despite the views of most of my
Greek brothers. There are many
reasons for a person not to go Greek:
financial, since it costs quite a lot to
participate in a fraternity; social,
especially since the ‘‘partying”’
demands of a fraternity in your first
two years can be quite binding;
academic, since some people are
here to study (not me of course, but I
thought I’d bring it up); and finally,
personal reasons. Approximately 35
percent of all W&L students are In-
dependents, and the number is grow-
ing.
» * my dissertation during Rush

 

 

The following editorial is
reprinted with permission from the
Sept. 17 issue of The Daily Tarheel,
the student newspaper of the Univer-
sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill:

Things are tough all over.

While UNC women grum-
ble...Let’s be careful, here. While
some UNC women grumble about
the decreasing supply of UNC
men — as the percentage of
women in each entering class
hovers around 60 _ percent
— students at a university in
Virginia grumble about having
any women at all.

To be more exact, these grum-
bling students are males at
Washington and Lee University
and they’re not really opposed to
women on campus (legendary pil-
grimages to and from nearby
women’s colleges attest to that),
they’re just opposed to having to
go to class with them. Cooties, you
know.

 

Another view
Tradition, is thy name woman?

You see, for 200 years W&L, a
small liberal arts college in the
Shenandoah Valley, has been an
all-male bastion resembling more
an overgrown fraternity than a
modern university. Yet that’s the
way a lot of the ‘“‘Southern gentle-
men”’ there liked it — sort of like a
kid’s treehouse where signs pro-
claim, ‘‘No Girls Allowed!’’ But
this year for the first time,
women, 111 of them, will join the
1,350-member student body and
many of the traditionalists are
complaining.

W&L’s student body president
put it this way: “They’re making
too many changes too fast. I love
this school ... and I feel betrayed.”’
Awwwww. Does da wittle prezy
worwy dat women will wooin his
wittle school?

Well, he might, but the school’s
administrators think it’s the best
thing to happen there since Sweet
Briar, an all-women’s bastion,
was founded nearby. After the an-
nouncement last year that women

 

would be admitted, applications
shot up 81 percent and the average
SAT scores rose 65 points over the
scores of the preceding class.

One faculty member pronounc-
ed happily: “This is going to be
the saving of this university. Now
we can recruit from the brightest
women in the country.”

Yep. The writing’s on the wall.
Pretty soon their admissions of-
fice will see what they’ve been
missing and start a battle cry like
— “10 percent now, 60 percent
tomorrow!”’

For at least a few years, how-
ever, there’ll be a fair-sized con-
tingent of bewildered males be-
moaning the scrapping of a cher-
ished tradition and watching as
pink curtains and little stuffed
animals make their appearance
on this once-haven for southern-
style gentility. Little do they know
how soon it will be before the
women will be doing their own be-
moaning — ‘“‘What W&L needs is a
few good men.”’

 

 

 

 

 

 

Charge card helps the memory

MY
VIEW

  

»| By John
=.) Pensec

‘Do you have your card?” That
one simple request has upset a great
number of students. The card that is
referred to is the small blue one
issued by the bookstore. Its purpose
is to serve as a charge card; some-
thing to indicate that the bearer has
permission to charge. Some have
suggested that the cards disregard
the White Book. Really!

Supposedly, honor had nothing to
do with making the switch from using
peoples’ memories to a more accur-
ate system. After talking to Book-
store Manager Helena W. Roller and
after having worked there for a year,
I am forced to agree that honor, or a
supposed lack of it, had nothing to do
withit.

What was a factor was trying to
figure out how to best serve both the
students and their parents. You all
remember parents, don’t you? They
are the ones who pay the bills. Well, a
few of these parents have complain-
ed that their offspring did not have
permission to charge, especially
after receiving a bill from the
Business Office. Or, better yet, there
are students who have permission to
charge books for classes, and then
ring up a hefty bill that includes

Playboy and, dare I say it, Christmas
presents!

But we wouldn’t do that, would we?
After all, we are honorable people.

The charge cards may not be able
to solve all the problems. It is a step
in the right direction, however. For
one thing, the cards reduce the
amount of work that has to be done
by an employee of the bookstore, and
this enables that person to have more
time to help customers. Does anyone
know what it is like trying to verify
hundreds of numbers a day? Sure, it
is part of the job of working in the
bookstore. But so is helping the custo-
mers. Have you tried doing both
when faced with 43 pages of student
identification numbers?

Everyone is always commenting
on what a great thing our Honor Sys-
tem is and how our checks are

The bookstore does its billing

puter. I hate to be the one to
break the news to you, but you are on-
ly a number to that computer. Let’s
at least try to connect the right
number with the right students.

Sure, the cards are a nuisance.

orientation, I told you of the advan-

tages of going through Rush, and I
hope you followed my advice and the
advice of Associate Dean of Students
Dan Murphy and _Interfraternity
Council President Jaimie Hayne, and
made the most of the Rush exper-
ience. If you did, things are probably
still a little foggy, but try to concen-
trate, focus and finish this article.
Also by now you are considering your
situation in respect to houses, school
and probably your love-life (the lat-
ter, a four-year quest), and I hope
that your are following my advice of
carefully considering the decision
you are about to make.

Consider the fact that you are forc-
ed by the early Rush system to
choose your circle of friends very
early in your college career. They
will not be your only friends, but ask
any member of any house and he will
admit that his brothers are his
primary friends. Also consider the
term ‘‘brother’’; this is how your
relationship with these people as well
as the other freshmen rushing that
house is to be forever framed. If you
are ready to choose that circle of
friends, ready to consider them
“brothers’’ — then by all means ac-
cept the bid. If not, don’t worry.
There are other options.

The option that I am most familiar
with is the Independent Union. The
I.U. is an organization founded with
the hopes of providing the oppor-
tunities, advantages and services of
a fraternity without the obligations
or disadvantages. We hold parties
like our very successful Christmas
party; we provide academic ser-
vices, such as an extensive cold-test
file and academic counseling; and
we organize and sponsor athletic in-
tramural teams that compete direct-
ly with the fraternities.

The I.U. is always open to new sug-
gestions for other services, and I
hope that all of the women and all of
the non-pledging men, and of course
all the independent upperclassmen,
will attend our first meeting next
week and give us a chance. We are
here to serve you, but we need you as
a means to that end.

The Independent Union is not the
only alternative to fraternity life.
With the new party pavilion, the Stu-
dent Activities Board has beefed up
its concert calendar with some fine
entertainment for the year to come.
And in addition, the fraternities here

at W&L are some of the best around
as far as opening their doors to non-
members. I attend a lot of fraternity
parties and have friends at most fra-
ternities, and I have never had a pro-
blem at any fraternity. The members
simply ask that you behave like a
gentleperson (coeducation is
tough! ), and respect their two-a-year
closed-party requests for special oc-
casions like Christmas and Fancy
Dress. (The Independent Union will
attempt to put on parties for the in-
dependents, et. al. on these typically
closed-party nights.) And besides,
you can always rush again next year

So, there are many doors and
avenues open to the person who has
decided not to go Greek this year.
The I.U., the fraternities, the SAB,
and the University itself are all here
to ensure that not only do you grad-
uate with the best education $7,100
can buy, but to be sure you also have
the best time that is legally and
morally possible. Make your decision
carefully. Use reason, insight, a
pocket calculator, a coin — anything
that will help you make the right
decision.

(Diffenderffer, a senior, is the presi-
dent of the Independent L nion.)

Dorm laundry
is a Quandary
for freshmen

 

By DANA BOLDEN
Staff Reporter

 

The five washers and dryers in the
basement of Graham-Lees dormitory
aren’t enough to serve the 400-
member freshman class, several
students say, but the University is
considering installing more.

About 25 freshmen interviewed this
week said they often have trouble
finding a working or unoccupied
washer or dryer.

Freshman Brett LaPrairie said he
has to set his alarm for 4 a.m. just to
find an open washing machine for his
clothes.

Freshman Jessica Reynolds was
one of several women to express dis-
satisfaction over having to carry a
loaded laundry basket across Wash-
ington Street to the laundry room.

‘The machines are really harsh,
and I wouldn’t wash clothes down
there unless I absolutely had to,”
said Jodi Ringwald.

“We pay $10,000 a year, and we
can’t even get decent washers and
dryers,’ freshman Hunter McFad-
den said.

On Tuesday, all five dryers in the
laundry room took money, but only
two worked. Of the five washers, two
took money but only one worked,

Dean of Freshmen H. Robert.
Huntley said he recognizes the need
for more laundry facilities.

“Right now I would like to have
more washer and dryers in Davis

dormitory, even tnough it would
mean adding more plumbing,’’ Hunt-
ley said.

There are more than 400 students
in this year’s freshman class, an in-
crease of about 30 over past years. In
a survey of 10 freshmen women and
10 freshmen men, it was found that
the women tend to wash their clothes
once a week — about twice as often
as the men.

“There are a lot of changes that
have occurred with coeducation, and
they have created more problems
than we anticipated.’’ Huntley said.
“‘We are doing our best to correct the
ones that we have now and prevent
anymore to come, but we can only
relate to the need as it is expressed.”’

Lee Dudley, technical assistant to
the superintendent of buildings and
grounds, said buildings and grounds
is aware of the problems with the
laundry room, but that every time
they call the firm that operates the
machines — Solon Automated Ser-
vices Inc. — all they get is an answer-
ing machine.

Dudley said they have called every
day since Monday to get the
machines fixed and that there is little
else they can do until their superin-
tendent, James Arthur, returns from
vacation next week.

“Buildings and grounds has found
that women, although there aren’t as
many, occupy the machines more
than the men,”’ Dudley said.

For that reason, he said, plans to
put washers and dryers in Davis
dormitory are ‘‘in the works.”’

Having an honor system really
does cause some interesting
things to happen, but this event
should be placed somewhere in
the category of remarkable.

Last Thursday junior John Rior-
dan washed his clothes in the
basement of Graham-Lees dormi-
tory.

One thing led to another, and the
day’s activities pulled Riordan

 

away from the laundry room
while his clothes were drying.

Riordan, who says he some-
times has a tendency to forget
things, left his clothes drying until
Saturday.

Time didn’t permit him to make
the trip to the dormitory to
retrieve his clothing until Sunday,
when he began what he thought
might be a hopeless search for his
apparel.

To his surprise, when he entered
the basement of Graham-Lees, he
did not find his laundry scattered

“If these are the effects of

Four barbershops in town have a
“‘gentleman’s agreement” to charge
the same amount for haircuts, ac-
cording to managers of three of the
stores.

Buck’s, Wendell’s, Ideal and the
Jackson barbershops all have a basic
rate of $5 for haircuts.

“We pretty well try to stay
together on prices,” said Robert
Webb, owner of Buck’s.

At Wendell’s barbershop, Wendell
Baker stressed that having the same
prices is a ‘‘gentleman’s agree-
ment.’’ Because there is no barber’s
union, this is the way the local bar-
bers maintain a reasonable income.

Webb said the barbers raise the
prices when they all agree it is time.

The barbershops are not only simi-
lar in prices, but in the hours they are
open.

The Jackson barbershop, located
on Nelson Street, is open from 8:30
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through
Friday.

Wendell’s, on Jefferson Street, is
open from 9 to 6 Monday through Sat-
urday, but is closed Wednesday.

Buck’s, at 205 S. Main St., is open
Monday through Friday from 8 to 5,
Saturday 8 to 4, but is closed Wednes-
day.

The Ideal barbershop, on Main
Street, is open 8 to 5 Monday through
Friday and Saturday from 8 to noon,
but is closed Wednesday.

For those who feel more comfor-
table in a hairdresser’s than a bar-
bershop, there are options.

The Style Shop at 1 E. Preston St.,
George’s Hairstylists at 135 Varner
Lane, and Marie’s Hairstylists in the
Old Main Street Shopping Mall are
three of the hairstylists in town.

Tax hike to raise prices of bottled liquor, mixed drinks

 

By JIM STRADER
News Editor

 

The new federal excise tax on li-
quor which takes effect Tuesday will
mean little more than headaches, ac-
cording to many of those affected by
it in the Lexington area as well as
across the country.

The nationwide tax affects only
distilled beverages— wine and beer
are exempt — and is the first in-
crease in liquor taxes since 1951.

The most obvious and widely-af-
fected group is the liquor consumer,
who will be affected by the rise ex-
pected in liquor prices. According to
a liquor lobby spokesman, the
average increase expected in a one-
fifth gallon bottle of liquor is about
two dollars.

Gene Paxton, manager of the Lex-
ington Alcoholic Beverage Control
store, said he was unsure how prices
at the store would be affected. ‘“‘We
don’t figure any of that,’ he said.
‘That all comes from the home office
in Richmond.”

Dunbar named to Student Control’s Certification Committee

Paxton said that a new ABC price
book would be available on Tuesday,
but added that he had no other infor-
mation on new prices. ‘We haven’t
received anything in the mail on it,”
he said.

Bob Campbell, manager of The
Palms, said that the measure’s ef-
fects would not immediately be seen
as price increases, but that down the
line he might be forced to pass any in-

‘creased expenses along to
customers,

“It’s the old American way,” he
said. ‘‘Somebody’s going to stick the
consumer.”

Campbell said that while it is too
early to tell how the tax increase will
affect his business, the major pro-
blem he foresees is in the administra-
tion of the new law.

“It’s going to mean mountains of
extra paperwork for the small busi-
nessman,’’ Campbell said. He added
that it might be necessary, in order to
adhere to the new accounting pro-
cedures, to make his bookkeeper
work extra hours or to hire an ac-
countant.

The reporting system to be used in
conjunction with the new law has not
been decided yet, Campbell said.
“It’s still in the infancy stage. They
haven’t decided whether they’re go-
ing to have reports quarterly or an-
nually,”’ he said.

Campbell said he has adopted a
wait-and-see attitude on the change,
but added that he may be forced to
take some action. ‘‘If I get audited, it
will mean that I’ve got to pass that
cost on,’’ he said.

Spanky’s manager David Sorrels
said that the only problem he fore-
sees is a rise in the price of his mixed
drinks, but added that he had not
looked deeply into the matter.

“This is something that I’ve tried
to read about and it is really, really
confusing,”’ he said. ‘‘The ABC board
has sent us some material but they
really haven’t pushed it too hard.”

Bob Sievers, spokesman for the
Distilled Spirits Council of the United
States (DISCUS), explained that the
tax increase came as a result of the
Tax Reform Bill of 1984, which was
designed to reduce the national bud-

get deficit. Federal taxes on cigaret-
tes, which were due for revision this
year, were supposed to drop, he said,
in exchange for an increase in the tax
on liquor. Sievers said that in the cur-
rent plan, the cigarette tax will re-
main the same, and the liquor tax
will go up.

It has been reported by public-in-
terest groups that the tax could cut
the budget deficit by $12 billion a
year. A report by the National Alco-
hol Tax Coalition claims that alcohol-
related problems cost the nation $12
billion a year in health care, law en-
forcement and lost productivity.

The new tax creates some problem
in the alcohol industry, Sievers ex-
plained.

“Since the mid-1970s, when sales
peaked, the industry has been slowly
contracting,” he said. ‘“‘We expect
the trend, which is occurring again in
"85, to continue and maybe acceler-
ate.”

DISCUS reports that there have
been plant closings among distiller-
ies and unemployment is rising. Sea-
gram’s, for example, cut its sales

force by one-third, Sievers said, and
Jack Daniels has had to lay off work-
ers. Production is down in the liquor
industry, Sievers said, but it has been
forced to bear much of the federal
tax burden.

‘“‘We’re paying more than our fair
share,” he said.

It is especially difficult, Sievers
said, with the problems that the in-
dustry has been experiencing lately,
and because there is a feeling of ine-
quity regarding taxes on wine and
beer.

The industry’s point of view on the
situation was: “‘Why tax a single pro-
duct?” Sievers said. Several distil-
leries have mounted advertising
campaigns to educate the public on
what Sievers called ‘‘the equivalency
of alcohol.” They show that a person
can become equally intoxicated by
drinking different amounts of liquor,
wine and beer, he said.

“The abuse problem is. industry
wide and we're bearing the brunt of
the tax,” he said. There is no current
legislation to tax wine or beer in a

similar fashion, Sievers added.

Figures compiled by DISCUS show
that after the tax increase goes into
effeot, federal taxes on the average
mixed drink will be four times that on
a bottle of beer and 18 times the tax
on a glass of wine. DISCUS says that
the three drinks all contain the same
amount of alcohol.

In addition to the educational ads,
liquor companies have taken out ads
protesting the tax hike. Kahlua, for
instance, had a full-page ad in a na-
tional news magazine several weeks
ago encouraging consumers to
“stock up on Kahlua before that tax-
ing date and you'll save yourself a
bundle.”’

There are no gimmicks in play at
the ABC store in Lexington, said Pax-
ton, and he hasn’t noticed any in-
crease in business lately. He said
that a sign explaining the tax hike is
displayed on the wall, but the re-
sponse has been slow.

“Someone might buy a few extra
bottles,” he said. ‘‘But that’s nothing
to get excited about.”’

Professor’s book wins awards

A zoology textbook by biology Professor Cleveland P.
Hickman Jr. has won several awards for design.

“Integrated Principles of Zoology,’’ written by
Hickman, Larry S. Roberts of Texas Tech and Frances
M. Hickman of DePauw University, has won awards
from the American Institute of Graphic Arts, the Art
Directors Club Inc. of New York, and Graphic Design.

Published by Times Mirror/Mosby College Publish-
ing, this is the seventh edition of the popular textbook,
first published 28 years ago.

Book calls W&L a bargain

Washington and Lee is one of 221 colleges and univer-
sities featured in ‘“‘The Best Buys in College Educa-
tion,’’ a new book by Edward B. Fiske, education editor
of The New York Times. The book, which mentions 10
other Virginia schools, is a consumer’s guide to colleges
that offer high-quality education at a reasonable cost.

Fiske said students enrolling at W&L ‘‘will receive an
excellent education at a reasonable rate.”

‘“‘The cost of a Washington and Lee education is at the
higher end of a bargain,’ he writes, ‘‘but the outstand-
ing nature of the academic program ranks it with col-
leges that usually cost half again that much.”’

Fiske says W&L’s best academic offerings “‘lie in
English, history, and the professional school of com-
merce, which includes business, economics, and poli-

‘tics departments. This partly explains why it boasts

such high percentages of acceptance at schools of law
and business. Journalism is also strong, as are German
and Romantic languages and chemistry,”

The W&L Honor System and the accessibility of facul-
ty also earned high marks from Fiske.

‘The honor code is taken seriously at W&L

—itsh
the influence of Robert E. Lee — and exams erenapeas:
tored, doors left unlocked, and the library open 24 hours

a day, seven days a week,”’ Fiske writes, “The faculty
members are committed. ‘Their doors are always open
to you, and you can call them at home for help,’ asserts
one English major.”’

Fiske mentions the W&L social life, the “
meals at Evans Dining Hall, active in
intramural programs, and the Unive
the Shenandoah Valley as assets that
quality of a W&L education.

guished,”’ Fiske writes, ‘‘Washingto: :

Governor
appears at

local rally

By JOHN PIPKIN
Staff Reporter

 

Gov. Charles Robb stopped in Lex-
ington for 10 minutes Monday even-
ing to attend a reception for Mary
» Sue Terry, the Democratic candidate
for Virginia attorney general.

About 30 people gathered on Hop-
kins Green, across from The Palms,
for the reception.

Robb described Terry as a ‘‘superb
candidate”’ and said she is ‘‘the kind
of leader that will make a very effec-
tive attorney general.”’

Terry expressed this same confi-
dence when she described her ticket
as having “the edge in experience,
effectiveness and leadership” over
the Republican ticket.

Throughout the evening, Terry
stressed her experience as the major
issue in the election.

A native Virginian, Terry received
her law degree from the University
of Virginia in 1973. Since then, she
has served in the House of Delegates
for eight years and participated on
justice, conservation and education
committes.

Terry is also the only candidate for
attorney general who has been a pro-
secutor in the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia. She takes a firm stand against
drunk driving and cites this as a ma-
jor problem that she will continue to
battle if elected.

Terry said she has received sup-
port from community and profession-
al organizations like the Fraternal
Order of Police and the Virginia Bar
Association. In addition, an un-
precedented percentage of bar presi-
dents have given her their support.

Most importantly, however, Robb
has given the Democratic ticket his
full support in a show of party unity.

Terry was in Lexington to help
raise funds for her campaign. The
reception preceded a $250-a-plate
dinner at the Willson-Walker House.

Olin urges Young Democrats to get involved

 

By DEBORAH HATTES
Staff Reporter

 

At a school where conservatives
seem to outnumber liberals by at
least a 5-1 ratio, a speech by a Demo-
crat congressman doesn’t draw a
huge crowd.

“IT don’t think you ought to be
discouraged here at W&L. It’s not
typical,” said Congressman Jim Olin
of Virginia’s 6th district. ‘Just
because most of the W&L male stu-
dents have been Republicans, that
doesn’t mean it always has to be that
way,” Olin said.

Olin spoke to a group of about 12 at
the first meeting of the year of the
Washington and Lee Young Demo-

crats Tuesday night. He asked for
their help in the upcoming November
election.

“This is a very important political
year in Virginia,” Olin said. ‘‘All the
members of the General Assembly
are running.”’

Olin asked for support for Dennis
Brown, who is running for the Gen-
eral Assembly from the 24th District.

“He is one person you can work for
here,’’ Olin said.

He also threw his support behind
the Democratic ticket of Gerald
Baliles for governor, Doug Wilder for
lieutenant governor, and Mary Sue
Terry for attorney general.

“They represent a most unusual
ticket. It’s the first time any party

has run a woman, and I think, the
first time any party has run a black
person (Wilder) for statewide of-
fice.”

Olin commented that Gov. Charles
Robb seems to be making political
plans for after his term as governor
ends.

“Tt seemed to me he definitely has
aspirations for something else. One
of the things he’s trying to do very
clearly is to position himself so that
he represents the very acceptable
type of Southern Democrat, who’s
fiscally conservative, very responsi-
ble, and very acceptable to all the
Southern states as far as possible so
that he can be available in the event
that the national ticket is looking for
such a person...It’s not inconceivable

ticket.’’

Looking ahead to the 1986 Congres-
sional elections, Olin said: ‘This is
going to be a very significant election
year. On the average, in the sixth
year of a president’s term, the party
opposite from that of the president
has picked up something like 38 more
votes. That could happen.”’

“There’s a very strong chance that
next time, the Senate can move over
to the Democratic side,” he added.

Olin said he is not sure who will be
the Democratic presidential nominee
in 1988. But at the mention of Lee Iac-
coca, chairman of Chrysler Corp.,
Olin said, ‘“‘Don’t rule him out. He is
extremely popular. He’s caught the
imagination of the public.”’

Rhodes, Fulbright:

Deadlines near
for scholarships

 

By CHRIS APPLEBY
Staff Reporter

 

As October approaches, so does the
due date for applications for Rhodes
and Fulbright scholarships.

The prestigious Rhodes scholar-
ship elections will be held in
December 1985. Washington and Lee
has sent three men to Oxford in the
past 10 years.

The University has had as much
success with Fulbright applicants,
according to program director and
English Professor John Evans. He
said the University has produced one
or more Fulbright scholars each year
for the past several years.

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela Simpson, head of the Grad-
uate Fellowship Committee, said a
spring luncheon is held to familiarize
students with the various scholar-
ships available. These include the
Marshall, Mellon, Luce, Rotary,
Truman and St. Andrew’s scholar-
ships. All students attaining a grade
point average of 3.5 or better are in-
vited to participate.

The Rhodes scholarship was estab-
lished by Cecil Rhodes, who created
a two-year scholarhips program in
which students are allowed to choose
their own course of study, with the
possibility of taking a third year.

In his will, Rhodes put a strong em-
phasis on the character of the
scholar. According to University
President and Rhodes scholar John
Wilson, Rhodes expectations have
been misunderstood. Rhodes’ wish
for the scholars to “fight the world’s
fight’’ is actually a desire for them to
better the world through various
forms of public service.

Rhodes hoped that after the inter-
national study experience, the
scholars would return to their own
country to take positions of influence
and leadership in their professions.
Rhodes’ will outlined courage, truth-
fulness, moral force of character,
leadership instincts, athletic ability
and scholastic achievement among
his criteria for scholarships ap-
plicants.

The basic requirements for U.S.
applicants include American citizen-
ship with a minimum of five years
domicile and at least junior standing

at a degree-granting college. The
students must also be single and bet
ween the ages of 18 and 24. Students
may apply in their home state or the
state in which they are attending
school.

American applicants are chosen in
December by state and district com
mittees. The country is divided into
eight districts of six or seven stale
Each state committee chooses two
candidates to appear before the
district committee, which then ap
points four Rhodes scholars from
among the state nominees

For the Fulbright grants, Evans
particularly encourages foreign
language students to apply. Evans is
on leave this semester, but will be
available for conferences to discuss
students’ applications for thei
Fulbright projects. To apply for a
Fulbright grant, which are limited to
seniors, students must choose a coun
try in which they wish to study and
outline tbe year-long projects they in
tend to follow.

The Fulbright Act of 1946, named
for and initiated by U.S. Senator J
William Fulbright, advocated an in
ternational exchange of students
The Fulbright scholarships are
meant to further international under
standing and promote study by U.S
scholars abroad and foreign students
here.

The Fulbright-Hayes Act of 1961
strengthened the effectiveness of the
program by providing for the stu
dents’ round-trip transportation, tui
tion, books and food for one academic
year, as well as paying for health and
accident insurance. The Institute of
International Education in New York
annually distributes a list of the
available Fulbright awards .
with other foreign study grants

The deadline for F ulbright applica
tions to Dean Simpson is Oct. 15
Potential Rhodes scholars are re
quired to submit their applications to
philosophy Professor Ramsey Mar
tin by Oct. 31.

The Marshall, Mellon, Luce and

Truman applications are also due
next month. The St. Andrews and Ro
tary scholarships are to be submitted
in January and March, respectively

Information on the scholarship pro

grams is available in Simpson’s o!

Ethics

 

Continued from Page 1

The essential difference of Gustaf-
son’s ideas compared with all other
theological viewpoints in this cen-
tury, he added, is “that you have a
radical challenge both at the popular
level...and at the scholarly level.”’

While spending his sabbatical at
the University of Chicago in 1981,
Beckley audited several courses
taught by Gustafson. He became
very interested in the theologian’s
first volume on ethics and theology,
which was published in the same
year.

Beckley began organizing the sym-
posium three years ago with Robin
Lovin, a faculty member at the Chi-

Atwood

are incomplete.

A major accomplishment under At-
wood’s leadership was the move to
the renovated Commerce School
Building, which as McCormick Hall
had formerly housed the University
Library.

In addition, Atwood said that ‘‘bus-
iness, economics and politics have
become very popular majors while
I’ve been dean — but not because I’ve
been dean.”

The dean said another pattern he’s
noticed is the decline of interest in
social issues by today’s students
compared to students of the previous
two decades.

Currently there’s a lot of interest
in making a lot of money, which is too
bad,” he said, adding that the bright
side is that ‘‘it’s gotten so at least
some students are interested in
investments in South Africa and that
sort of thing.’’

Atwood said he’l] have much fewer
time demands with his new role of
just teaching classes, including his
well-known ‘Money and Banking.”

The dean said he’ll miss having a
personal secretary, but noted that
Anne S. Zeigler, his assistant, is so
popular with students he has to share
her even now.

As an example, he fetched a post-
card he received this week from one
of last year’s graduates who is now at

cago Divinity School.

“T would know when my telephone
rang promptly at 9 on Saturday
morning who would he on the othe:
line,"’ Lovin said, recalling the
endless details he helped organize.

Lovin called Gustafson’s book the
culmination of his career, a ‘‘bench-
mark work.”’

“Some theologians will write
works early in their career and then
move away from them,” he said.
“Others move away too.”’

But Gustafson’s ideas are so radi-
cal that many scholars are attracted
to them, Lovin said.

Beckley said the Philip Fullerton
Howerton Fund for Special Pro-
grams in the Department of Religion
provided the money needed to hold
the symposium.

the Harvard Business School.

‘Dear Mrs. Z. and Dean Atwood,”’
it began.

‘See — that’s how they come in,”
he chuckled.

Wilson’s letter noted that Atwood’s
colleagues will miss “‘his droll com-
mentary on the passing scene.”’

“Droll,’’ Atwood mused, looking
the very picture of the word in ques-
tion. ‘I’m not sure I know what that
means.”’

“Is that good or bad?’’ he asked
with a glimmer in his eye, getting out
of his chair and padding over to a
deskside dictionary.

‘** ‘Amusingly odd or whimsically
comical,’ " he read.

The verdict: ‘“‘That’s all right, I
guess.”’

Atwood himself brought up the fact
that he’s aware students have two
nicknames for him.

He explained very seriously that
one somewhat unfamiliar to this stu-
dent generation, ‘‘Easy Ed,’’ is gen-
erally meant somewhat sarcastical-
ly.

 

JAMES GUSTAFSON

“T think I grade fairly,” he said.
“There are some students, though
that think I demand too much.... So
the ‘easy’ is the opposite.”’

What few students realize, he con-
tinued with the sort of detail usually
reserved for explaining the float on a
check, is that he’s been called ‘‘Easy
Ed”’ since before high school because
of his first two initials.

“The other name is ‘The Ax,’ ” he
said flatly. ‘‘Eddie the Ax.”

“‘T don’t know why I got to be ‘The
Ax,’ ” he said. ‘I have no idea. It pro-
bably came from when I was dean of
students.”

A visitor noted the appellation was
memorialized last year in the mis-
chievous name of W&L’s team in the
Intercollegiate Business Games and
Conference: ‘‘Edax Telecom Inc.”

“That never occurred to me,” At-
wood said as the light dawned. ‘I
read that, too.”’

Flattered?

“Sure, that’s fine,’ he said.

ed faculty members in doing that.”
Simpson, 39, downplayed her role
in bringing about the actual change
to coeducation, saying she was ‘“‘just
one voice among many.”’
She acknowledged, though, the
central part she played in the 14-

month conversion process as chair of
the 13-member Committee on Coedu-
cation.

Assistant English Professor Jean
C. Dunbar, who served on the com-
mittee, said Simpson’s position re-
quired “an awful lot of time
and...organizational effort.”’

“T think the community as a whole
owes her a debt of gratitude for the
enormous amount of energy she put
into the opening stages” of the com-
mittee, Dunbar said.

Sophomore charged in shotgun incident

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

Sophomore Drake Fason of Austin,
Texas, was charged with discharging
a weapon, brandishing a weapon and
carrying a loaded weapon in the city
Sunday after he reportedly fired a
shotgun from the third floor of the
Kappa Sigma fraternity house.

Officer G.P. Joines said in a police
report that at 12:15 a.m., he heard a
blast behind the house and a voice
saying ‘‘I got him now.”’

“Don’t do it,’’ someone replied, ac-

cording to the report. ‘‘It’s going too
far.”

Joines said he then saw two feet of
a gun barrel appear from a second-
story rear window. He called for
assistance, entered the house, and
found two shotguns and a 50-calibre
muzzle loader.

The barrel of one of the guns was
warm, Joines reported, and Fason
said the weapon fired while they
were playing.

“A bunch of brothers raided the
house with firecrackers,’’ Fason
said. ‘It kind of got carried away. I
shot out the window.”

Fason said the musket was the
same one used by the Interfraternity
Council to signal the beginning of
Rush.

Kappa Sigma President Bill Hem-
phill said that a few fraternity
members ‘“‘who do not reside in the
house came over for a little late-night
fun.”

“The alleged perpetrator got car-
ried away and acted without think-
ing,” he continued.

Hemphill said Fason will be repri-
manded and that all firearms have
been banished from the house.

Rush will end with ‘pledge fever’

 

By PAUL DAVEY
Staff Reporter

 

When the clock strikes 11 tomorrow
evening, the Washington and Lee
campus will be gripped with a
peculiar type of hysteria: “pledge
fever.’’ For some, this will be a grand
occasion, while others will be forced
to ask themselves, ‘‘What did we do
wrong?”’

By now, the majority of the bids
have been given out by the various
fraternities. Unlike previous years,
when many freshmen had a week be-
tween the time they received their
bids and when they could accept
them and formally pledge a fraterni-
ty, the interim period has been short-
ened to two days this year. As well as
delaying the time period, the new
system doesn’t provide the opportu-

nity of receiving a bid “‘the second
time around,” which in years past
has been on a Wednesday evening

Historical facts aside, the end of
Rush — bids and pledging — is one of
the most interesting and electrifying
times of the year. Freshmen are on
the hot seat at first, waiting to see if
they receive bids, while the fraterni-
ty members next sweat it out, wait-
ing to see how many freshmen will
pledge.

The culmination of all this rushing,
waiting and sweating indeed occurs
late Friday night. Across the cam-
pus, amid house chants, the throwing
of beer (to the amazement of well-
dressed and suddenly _ horrified
young women), trickles and then
waves of freshmen will decide to
pledge. Pledging is a most important
part of the W&L experience. Fresh-

men need to look behind the facade of
each house they are considering and
attempt to see the true substance of
the fraternities. One must decide
with whom he wants to spend the
next four years, realizing that a
fraternity is not merely a place to
guzzle beer, watch television and
meet a variety of women. Especially
with such a short Rush, freshmen
must find the true essence of each
house and its members.

Pledge fever is almost upon us. It is
hoped that more people will exper-
ience a grand occasion than will
stand idly, second-guessing them-
selves. But most of all, the hope is
that the goal of Rush, to get the right
people in the right fraternities
through the bidding and pledging sys-
tem, will be achieved.

And remember: Wear old clothes.

IFC reminds houses of rules on freshmen

 

By JIM STRADER
News Editor

 

The president of the Interfraternity
Council Tuesday night reminded
fraternity representatives that they
must take freshmen back to the dor-
mitories immediately after tomor-
row night’s Rush dates. The fresh-
men must return to houses on their
own if they decide to accept bids for
membership, President Jaimie
Hayne said.

In other action at Tuesday’s
meeting, IFC Rush Chairman Sam
Svalina asked that houses submit
lists of their pledges and an estimate
of the number they anticipate get-
ting.

Svalina also asked that represen-
tatives report on how much money
they spent on bands during Rush. The
reports must include the name of the
band as well.

Svalina said that it has been
reported that some houses have ex-
ceeded the $2,700 limit that the IFC

Sarber sparks second soccer shutout

Mier 3* 4!

, By ROB MacPHERSON
_ Staff Reporter

Usually, coaches are pleased if

» their players improve with every

. game. But as far as Washington and

, Lee soccer coach Rolf Piranian is

concerned, one of his players can
* keep doing what he’s been doing.

* Freshman forward Johnny Sarber
* added two more goals to his season
+ total Saturday afternoon to pace the
* Generals to a 2-0 victory over Old
+ Dominion Athletic Conference foe
, Eastern Mennonite. The tallies gave

Sarber four goals in the two games
« W&L has played.

+ Sarber and the rest of his team-
, mates’ offensive output, coupled with

some excellent defensive play in
r each of its first two contests, puts the
, Generals at 2-0 as they head into to-

day’s game with Mary Washington,
* the 17th-ranked Division III soccer
, team in the nation.

The Generals earned their second
victory of the year on Saturday by
* taking advantage of Sarber’s nose for
» the ball. Said Piranian, ‘“‘He has a

knack for being in the right place at
* the right time.”’

At 38:42 of the first half against
"Eastern Mennonite, Sarber found
“himself in “the right place” to
* receive a perfectly placed cross from
, Corky Parkinson. He then managed

to get enough of his head on the ball
+to drive it into the net for his, and
, W&L’s, first goal of the game.

Play continued throughout the half
* at the heated pace that the Generals
, had anticipated. W&L dominated the
offense by employing a time consum-

* ing, ball-control type of play.
+ They waited patiently until 5:11,
, when a missed penalty kick and the
melee following it resulted in a
»General throw-in. The ball came in
_ quickly, confusing the Eastern Men-
nonite defense, and Sarber was there
*to take full advantage of the situa-

,

_., tion.

 

“

After bouncing around for awhile,
“the ball found a temporary home on
,Sarber’s foot. He discarded his newly

acquired property and beat the
*Mennonite goalie for the game’s final

The Generals used ‘‘heads up” play to defeat Eastern Mennonite on Saturday

tally. It was then just minutes until
half time and, for the most part, the
game was over.

The second half featured two
teams going through the motions and
highlighted the W&L defense. It turn-

ed back whatever offense Eastern
Mennonite could muster and with
some fine goal tending by Chris
Gareis, the Generals were able to
preserve their second shutout in two
games.

After today’s match against Mary

road for games with Newport News

rated ODAC rival Lynchburg Wed-

The Generals, though they finished
where they had hoped, thought they
could have played better. Leslie
said: ‘‘We should be scoring 310 or
under for our one-day total instead of
the 320 and 319 that we did, and the
players know it.”

The tournament proved once again
to be a very well organized showcase
of area collegiate golf skill. The play-
ing conditions were excellent despite
one hour fog delays each morning
Coach Leslie had nothing but praise
for the weather and the condition of
the course: ‘‘It was perfect weather
to play. The greens were well water-
ed and they held quite well.’’

‘Harriers to open season on road

The W&L cross country team will

* spring into action Saturday as it

+ kicks off the running season against

Washington College and Mary Wash-

* ington College. The meet will be held
+ in Chestertown, Md.

After last year’s dream season in

“which the Generals went 14-0 and

.

won the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference, one might expect a letdown
for this season. But Coach Dick
Miller, ODAC Coach-of-the-Year last
season, is determined not to let this
happen

The well-balanced team will look to
returning lettermen, captain Ron
Moody, Eddie Goundry, Billy Clark,
and Ashe Andrews in addition to new-
comers Mathew Laws and Michael
Watson to lead the squad

tion in its second game of the tourney
as 15th-ranked Iona was too much for
the Generals, 20-3.

Remillard noted the instinctual
play of both Army and Iona was a
stage better than his squad. ‘‘We’re
still in the learning phase, and we
need to think things out before we ex-
ecute,”’ he said.

“The scores in those games are a
little inflated since we used everyone
once we decided that we could not
win the games.”

Having already lost two matches
and then falling behind by a 7-3
halftime score in its third contest
against Army — a game that started
at 11:30 p.m. — the Generals were in
a decidely unenviable position. But
the team that has been praised for its

abundance of potential was not about
to leave the land of Ivy without serv-
ing notice of its ability.

By the third period, W&L had come
back to tie the Cadets 7-7, and in the
fourth quarter, the Generals surged
to a 10-9 advantage on David Reavy’s
goal with 1:59 remaining in the
game.

In the waning seconds, Kevin
Lederer used his third foul to prevent
an Army goal, but in so doing forced
the Generals into a man-down situa-
tion for the remainder of the game.
The W&L defense rose to the chal-
lenge and preserved the 10-9 victory.

This weekend, W&L travels to

Richmond for the Virginia State
Championships.

men. It now appears that the silliest of all is Mr. Holmes. But don’t let
your human compassion run away with you by feeling the least bit of
sorrow or remorse for Holmes. His post-fight comments warrant no

Holmes perhaps didn’t know how to lose because he had never lost

Gridders surrounded in optimism for Centre

By DAVID EMRICH

Staff Reporter

Recall the last time you saw the
Washington and Lee football team in
action. Remember them? They were
the ones on the short end of a 30-0
score. What’s that? You say you’ve
already given up hope for a winning
or even respectable season? Well
don’t despair, because there is
nothing but optimism. surrounding
the squad as they prepare for the
home opener against Centre College
this Saturday.

Coach Gary Fallon saw many good
things in the team’s first game. The
defense, for example, played very
well. They conceded only one of
Emory and Henry’s touchdowns (the
rest came via turnovers) and allowed
the E&H offense but one sustained
drive.

Also, recently converted tailback
Chris Coffland did an excellent job,

rushing for 61 yards on 16 carries and
gaining 55 more yards on 7 recep-
tions. Said Fallon of Coffland, who
was a Safety until a week before the
E&H game, ‘Chris is a 110 percent
type of guy.”’ In W&L’s opener, the
offense moved the ball well and had
possession almost twice as long as
E&H, but turnovers marred an other-
wise positive performance.

Which leads to the question, If
there were so many good perfor-
mances in last week’s game then
what could be done to improve?
Fallon said, ‘‘We worked on condi-
tioning the offense, we felt they need-
ed it to maintain their fitness after
the off days. (The team was given off
the Sunday after the E&H loss, as
well as the following Saturday.) We
worked on execution and we definite-
ly believe it has improved.”

The defense, which played so well
in the season opener, has its work cut

out for it. Last week Mike Couchot,
Centre’s quarterback, threw for 171
yards on 10 completions, while run-
ning back Mike Kenyon ran for 76
yards on 12 carries. Said Fallon
“Centre poses a lot of different pro-
blems for our defense. It has some
fine running backs and a quarter-
back who can throw effectively.”

Running back Kevin Weaver is ex-
pected to return for Saturday’s
game. However, last week’s starter,
Coffland, is listed ahead of him on the
depth chart. Fallon said, ‘‘Kevin has
only been practicing with us once a
week. He’s healthy and he’s okay to
play, but he’s been busy with his
studies and ROTC.”

With both Weaver and Coffland, as
well as fullback Frand Surface, pro-
jected as playing this weekend,
the team culd be expected to run a
great deal. Not so says Fallon: ‘I'd
like to go into the game with a

The SAB sponsored The Targetz last night in GHQ

Romantics and R.E.M. on
85 SAB pavilion schedule |

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Editor

 

Pavilion concerts featuring the
Romantics and R.E.M. highlight this
fall's entertainment scheduled by the
Student Activities Board, and Ex-
ecutive Director Mike Guerriero said
he hopes the SAB can provide the
school with more non-concert related
activities as well.

The Romantics will be the feature
attraction at this year’s Homecom-
ing concert, Guerriero said. The con-
cert will be held on Friday, Oct. 11
and the admission for the event will
be $8 per person.

While $8 may seem a little high in
comparison to what W&L students
have paid for pavilion concerts in the
past, Guerriero said it is a very
reasonable price considering the
quality of the entertainment.

“It would cost about $15 a person to
see this same show in Roanoke,” he
said, ‘‘we’re barely about to cover
our costs by charging $8.”’

A capacity crowd in the pavilion
with each person paying $8 would
mean the SAB would lose money on
the concert, Guerriero said, but ad-
ded that he doesn’t mind taking a lit-

tle bit of a loss on a concert like this.

“We're providing high quality en-
tertainment at a reasonable price
and we're keeping our losses down,”’
he said. ‘‘We could charge more to
get into a pavilion concert and people
would still show up, but we want to
provide quality entertainment to as
many students as we can.”

In addition to the Homecoming
concert, Guerriero said a Christmas
concert featuring R.E.M. has been
set for Dec. 6. The charge for that
show will also be $8.

The increase in the beer-drinking
age will have some effect on pavilion
activity this year. Guerriero said
that the SAB will really have to tight-
en up its security efforts this year to
ensure that all the drinking laws are
enforced.

“We're going to have to crack
down this year,” he said. “It is very
important that we stay within the
limits of the law. If the ABC thinks
we can’t control crowds at the pavi-
lion, then they'll no longer issue us
beer permits.”

“This year, people who show up
drunk will not be let in and anyone
who we feel has had too much to
drink will not be served anything
else,”’ he said firmly.

Mellencamp a third-rate Springsteen?

MUSICNOTES

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Music Critic

 

 

Bruce Springsteen’s worldwide
dominance certainly has made the
American blue collar worker a ro-
mantic icon. Bob Seger was the first
to jump on Springsteen's coattails;
not only after the floodgates opened
and being out of a job became as hip
as — say — partying all-night-long.

John Cougar Mellencamp has
always been a third-rate Springsteen
— which in-turn makes him a fourth-
rate John Fogerty and an eighth-rate
Woody Guthrie. However, with
“Scarecrow,” the guy just might
make it with the big boys.

Springsteen’s songs take on the
Northeast and Segar’s take on
Detroit. Even Tom Petty seems to
regionalize his music in the South.
Similarly, John Cougar Mellen-
camp’s songs take place in, of all
places, Bloomington, Ind. A quick
listen to ‘Jack and Diane” will lay
testimony to just how boring it must
be to grow up in the middle of these

United States. Unfortunately, most of
Mellencamp’s earlier music reflect-
ed that boredom as well.

However, with ‘‘Scarecrow,’, Mel-
lencamp has found a truly compell-
ing subject to attack: the plight of the
nation’s farmers. The LP’s first
track, “Rain On The Scarecrow,”
opens with the line: ‘“‘Scarecrow on a
wooden cross; Blackbird in the
barn.” By making the scarecrow a
Christ symbol as well as a chilling
metaphor for the farmers’ situation,
Mellencamp pushes his writing to an
unexpected level of sophistication.

On “Justice and Independence
’85,’’ he recounts a parable about a
Boy named Independence who falls
for a girl named Justice. These two,
logically, have a baby named (are
you ready?) Nation. However, as
heavy-handed as this sounds, Mellen-
camp makes it work. As soon as Na-
tion is born, Justice leaves Indepen-
dence, you see, and Nation becomes
a hoodlum. Mellencamp, of course,
ends the song by pleading to Justice
and Independence that they get back
together and ‘‘make this family
whole,”

Well-known impostor
tries again at Emmys

TVREVIEW

By BILL HANNA
Television Critic

 

 

The big news in television this
week was the Emmy Awards, but not
who got what award but rather who
tried to accept one award.

Peter Graves had just announced
that Betty Thomas from ‘‘Hill Street
Blues” had won the Emmy for best
supporting actress in a drama series
and, as usual, the cameras panned
around the crowded hall to find
Thomas, but an unknown man had
already made his way to the podium
to accept the award.

The cameramen, having found
Thomas by now, were panicking. The
directors of the show must not have
been very calm either as they did not
know which acceptor of the award to
have the cameras focused on.

The solution was easy: Go to a
commercial.

When the show returned, Thomas
was ready to make her acceptance
speech and the viewing audience was
left to wonder what went on before
the break

It turned out that ‘The Impostor”
had struck again. Barry Bremen had
been successful in another imper-
sonation. Bremen gained fame as a
sports impersonator and now was
giving it his best shot at the Emmys.

Bremen has succeeded in appear-
ances in the 1979 NBA All-Star game
as a member of the team during
warm-ups.

Bremen then went on to the U.S.
Open where he played 9 holes with
Jerry Pate and Wayne Levi without
being noticed.

At the 1979 baseball All-Star game,
where he was even included in the
team picture ina Yankees uniform

His latest major appearance
before the Emmys was at this year’s
U.S. Open where he played 18 holes
with Fred Couples, Curtis Strange,
Jay Haas and Bob Eastwood

Bremen might have even gotten
away with the stunt except for his

miscalculated information that Betty
Thomas was not at the ceremony.

Now for this week on the tube. It is
premiere week for the networks and
a time that means an end to reruns
for a while and a look at the new
shows.

NBC still has its killer lineup for
Thursday night with ‘‘The Cosby
Show,” “Family Ties,’ ‘‘Cheers,”’
“Night Court’? and ‘“‘Hill Street
Blues.”’ Hopefully, ‘‘Family Ties,”’
will be nothing like its 2-hour movie
Monday night.

Hill Street will also have a new look
with some new characters and the
new executive producer replacing
Stephen Bochco.

Friday marks the season premiere
of a show that was cancelled by NBC
only to be brought back by ABC.
Let’s hear it for “Different Strokes”
Friday at 9.

For those not involved in Rush Fri-
day night or those simply blowing the
Rush Dates off, Friday is a good
night. CBS has ‘‘The Twilight Zone’’
from 8 to 9 then a quick switch to
NBC is rewarded by the 2-hour pre-
miere of ‘‘Miami Vice’’ filmed in
New York.

National Lampoon’s “Vacation”
comes to CBS Saturday at 9 if you
want a laugh or two before the par-
ties start.

Sunday looks good starting with
“Casablanca” at 10:35 a.m. on
WTBS. That night there’s Steven
Spielberg’s ‘‘Amazing Stories’ and
“Alfred Hitchcock Presents’’ follow-
ed by “First Blood,’’ all on NBC
starting at 8 p.m.

Monday provides a tough choice
between ‘‘Newhart” on CBS at 9:30
p.m. or the ‘‘Tonight Show’s 23rd An-
niversary Special” at 9p.m. on NBC.

Tuesday also provides some laughs
on HBO at 8 p.m. with ‘‘All of Me”’
starring Steve Martin and Lily Tom-
lin. Martin is in top form and comple-
plemented as well by Tomlin and a
good script.

Wednesday holds nothing extraor-
dinary aside from Dynasty and the
rest of the ABC nighttime soaps.

The fall season is looking good; so
sit back on a comfortable couch with
a bag of chips and enjoy it

This is a far ery from “‘sucking ona
chili dog outside the Tastee-Freeze.”’
If it sounds like Mellencamp isover-
reaching, then...well, you’re pro-
bably right. He is over-reaching. But
the guy certainly is giving it his best
shot.

The rest of the album explores
more standard themes. In ‘‘Minutes
To Memories,”’ an old man tells a
young bus passenger, ‘‘You are the
young and you are the future.”’ Mel-
lencamp also uses this piece to push
the values of honesty, hard work, and
that good old American way. Similar-
ly, ‘The Face of the Nation’’ wonders
just what has happened to that good
old American Way. ‘The face of the
nation,’’ Mellencamp tells us, “‘is
changin’!”’

The music? Well, the music is what
makes all of this sound sincere
(which is the only way any of this
stuff could work). The basic tracks
evidently were recorded live and the
production bristles with energy and
excitement. Most — OK, all — of the
tunes are standard three-chord rock
‘n roll with a terrific Stones-like
rhythm and blues edge added for
maximum danceability. The single,

“Lonely Ol’ Night”’ will probably be
picked up by every high school band
in the country. (When was the last
time you heard a high school band
not play ‘‘Hurts So Good?”’)

The record contains some wonder-
ful jewels as well. ‘‘Rumlesent”’ is a
tender, sincere-as-all-get-out depic-
tion of adolescent insecurity, confu-
sion and boredom. On ‘‘You’ve Got to
Stand For Something,” Mellencamp
makes wry references to Miss Amer-
ica in the nude, the Rolling Stones
still trying to be vital, and ‘Rocky
Stallone” cropping up in an old un-
derground X-rated movie. Here,
here, Mr. Mellencamp.

So, Mellencamp is still a third-rate
Springsteen. However, as long as
there are John Caffertys around, the
guy might just turn out to be a first
rate John Cougar Mellencamp. It his
ability catches up with his aspira-
tions, then our children might ask us
someday what President Mellen-
camp really meant when he said,
“Life goes on, long after the thrill of

Cooperation from local students
will make the job much easier for the
SAB. ‘‘It will be up to the students to
learn to be responsible drinkers at
these pavilion parties,’ Guerriero
said.

If the SAB should fail to meet the
standards set by the ABC, the results
could be no more beer at SAB func-
tions. ‘‘If we aren’t careful, the ABC
could stop giving us liquor permits.
That would mean no beer this year,
including Fancy Dress.’’

‘‘But if people act in a mature and
responsible manner, I see no pro-
blem with us keeping the beer in the
pavilion all year long,” he added.

Besides the two scheduled pavilion
concerts, Guerriera said the SAB
hopes to have a smaller scale pavi-
lion concert in November.

The SAB will continue to place
bands in the student pub on Wednes-
day nights as it has in past years. The
pub’s name-change from ‘The Cock-
pit’”’ to ‘“General Headquarters”’ will
not cause any change for the SAB
Guerriero said. ‘It might hurt The
Pit, but it is not going to hurt us,”’ he
said.

Guerriero said he was optimistic
that the higher drinking age won’t
have a drastic effect on Wednesday

night entertainment. ‘‘The Pit has a
very steady following — a lot of the
women’s college students come theré
before hitting the fraternities and it
provides Wednesday night entertain;
ment for independents.” =

“This year we'll be trying to bring
to some new names plus the old
names that people love to see,” hé
added. ‘.

The SAB will be upgrading its non;
band related activities, Guerriero
said. ‘We also want to provide somé
school-oriented trips, like hiking and
rafting with the Outing Club.” Guer-
riero added that he hopes the SAB
can schedule some group beach oF
ski trips as well.

In October, the SAB will be bring”
ing in movies for the campus. ‘We've
had good movies in the past, but
there have been scheduling pro-
blems. We hope to fix those problems
and spark some interest in ouy
movies. The more interest there is
the better movies we will be able to
get,”’ Guerriero said. '

Guerriero said his main goal for
the year is to see the SAB provide
students with a wide diversity of ac,
tivities, especially expanding those
beyond just brining bands to Lex‘
ington. =
