Freshman midterms
highest in 10 years

 

By SEAN BUGG
Staff Reporter

 

The average freshman grade point
average at midterm this fall was the
highest it’s been in at least a decade
— 2.451, an improvement of three-
tenths of a point over last year’s
2.151.

Dean of Freshmen H. Robert Hunt-
ley said the figure ‘‘is higher than
about ten years back.” He has not
checked beyond the 1973 figures.

As to whether coeducation might
be a factor in the improved GPA,
Huntley said he’s “really not sure if
that’s relevant’’ but that ‘‘we know
that on paper they were stronger
than any class we've seen in years.”

Of the top seven freshmen at mid-
term, five were women. In the class
of 410, 37 had GPAs in the “danger
zone’’ below 1.5. Only four of those
were women.

Huntley said that even with this
year’s higher scores, freshmen ‘‘still
encounter difficulty with the same

departments as they always did,”’ in
cluding math and history.

From current indications, the class
of 1989 ‘‘will be a good class through-
out its tenure here,’’ Huntley said.

He also noted it was a ‘‘much more
independent class’ than most pre-
vious classes. One indication of that,
the dean said, is the large number of
freshmen who asked for a change in
their faculty adviser.

Huntley said that in the past, most
students have just settled for the first
advisor they were assigned.

Perkins released from prison;
winter admission not sought

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Executive Editor

 

A former Washington and Lee stu-
dent convicted this summer of aiding
in a triple murder in North Carolina
was released from prison Tuesday
after serving four months in low-
security facilities.

University officials say, though,
than Ian M. ‘Doc’ Perkins, a W&L
junior last year, has not attempted to
enpoll for the winter term.

Perkins, 21, pleaded guilty in July
to being an accessory after the fact to
three May killings in Winston-Salem.
He testified that he became involved
with the slayings because he believed
he was assisting the CIA in a crack-
down on drug trafficking.

Perkins was housed at the med-
ium-security Polk Youth Center in
Raleigh from Aug. 15 to Oct. 1, when
he was transferred to a minimum-
security Guilford County correction-
al facility.

Guilford Superintendent
Bridges said Perkins was nha i
go’’ after 7 a.m. Tuesday.

Polk Assistant Superintendent R.C.
Lee said Perkins was transferred
because of his fine performance on
the point-system the facility uses to
track inmate behavior. Lee said Per-
kins had no disciplinary infractions.

Dean of Students Lewis G. John,
who this fall exchanged letters with
Perkins, said he has not requested re-
admission.

“Originally he intended to re-apply
for this winter, but now I think he just
hasn’t made up his mind, at least the
last time I talked to him,”’ John said.

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela H. Simpson, chair of the fac-
ulty committee on the automatic rule
and readmissions, said Perkins
would have to make such a request
by Dec. 16 to be considered for the
winter term.

Perkins’ current status with the
University is ‘eligible to return; did

not return,” according to Registrar
D. Scott Dittmann.

Philosophy Professor Harrison J.
Pemberton, Perkins’ former faculty
adviser, said that in letters Perkins
sent while incarcerated, he talked of
possibly returning to W&L, but now
he may have to go to school in-state.

“T think he spent all his money on
lawyers and he can’t come back,”’

Pemberton explained.
He said Perkins ‘“‘seemed to be
in good spirits — in fact very

upbeat about it.’’ He was on work-
release at an insulation job all day
and then came back and watched tel-
evision, so the prison experience was
“about as un-awful”’ as possible, ac-
cording to Pemberton.

Perkins, a former ROTC cadet,
“said it wasn’t much worse than be-
ing in the army,” the professor ad-
ded.

‘He wasn’t locked up in the pen-
titentiary like the hardened crimi-
nals.”’

Storms sidetrack and strand sleepy students

 

By JIM STRADER
News Editor

 

Rainstorms that swept through the
southeast last weekend caused unex-
pected problems for some Washing-
ton and Lee students returning to
school after Thanksgiving break.

Freshman Shawn Gulley of San An-
tonio, Texas, had to wait three hours
at the Charlotte, N.C., airport Sun-
day because weather conditions pre-
vented the continuation of his Pied-
mont Airlines flight from Dallas to
Roanoke. After waiting, Gulley
boarded one of several buses the
airline had chartered to ferry the
stranded passengers to Roanoke. He
said the trip took three hours.

A Piedmont public affairs office
spokeswoman said several flights
were forced to “‘overfly’’ Roanoke
because of adverse weather condi-
tions at the airport in Roanoke. Nor-
mally, she said, Piedmont puts

stranded passengers on later flights,
but in this case, all other flights were
booked because the weekend after
Thanksgiving traditionally is the
busiest of the year for Piedmont.

Gulley said his luggage remained
in Charlotte and he was unable to
pick it up in Roanoke until Monday.
He added that no compensation was
made by Piedmont for the missed
flight and that plane tickets were col-
lected from passengers when they
boarded the bus.

Once in Roanoke, Gulley said he
hooked up with two fraternity
brothers who had also been caught in
Charlotte, but chose to rent a car for
the trip to Lexington rather than take
the bus ride.

The experience of this trip made
Gulley rethink his Christmas travel
plans. “If I can get away with doing
something else, I sure am going to,”’
he said.

The toll of travel was not enough to
stop one student from meeting his

R.E.M. sold out; crowd
to be pavilion’s largest

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Editor

 

If you haven't bought your ticket
for tomorrow night’s Christmas con-
cert, you'd better make plans to do
something else. For the first time in
its two-year history, the student ac-
tivities pavilion has been sold out

Tickets for the show, featuring
R.E.M. with the Minutemen opening,
ran out at 2:20 p.m. yesterday. The
quest for tickets began Monday after-
noon, with lines forming in the Stu-
dent Center so die-hard fans could
get their quota of two tickets

“We sold 850 tickets the first day
and 700 the second day,” said senior
Mike Guerriero, executive director
of the Student Activities Board. ‘‘We
sold the last 450 tickets in 20 minutes
on Wednesday.”

During the first two days of the
ticket sales, students were limited to
two tickets. Yesterday, the sales

quota was raised to four and sales
were also conducted at the law
school.

The sellout means the pavilion will
be jammed with at least 2,000 spec-
tators as well as SAB workers and
the bands’ road, sound and lighting
crews. That will be the biggest crowd
the pavilion has yet seen

“The closest we've come to this
before have been the two Homecom-
ing concerts where we had around
1,700 people,’ Guerriero said.

A bigger crowd: means bigger
headaches for the SAB. Guerriero
said there will be an increase in
security for the show, and the Lex-
ington rescue squad has been alerted
to the possibility of heat victims

Guerriero attributed the concert’s
success to the popularity of R.E.M.
“They're not the biggest name we’ve
ever had in the pavilion, but they are
the most popular,”’ he said

“They are very current
students like them

and the

academic responsibilities. John
Atkins, a junior from Shreveport,
La., was flying from Atlanta to Roa-
noke but instead landed in Hunting-
ton, W. Va., where passengers were
instructed to leave the plane.

“T knew I was in trouble then,’’ he
said.

Atkins boarded a bus Piedmont
had chartered and, with at least
three other W&L students aboard,
rode six hours to Roanoke, arriving
at about 4:30 a.m. Monday. The stu-
dents reached Lexington after day-
break.

Despite the unexpected delays and
additional travel, Atkins attended
class Monday morning. ‘I crashed
for a couple of hours, but I had class
at 10,” he said. ‘‘I wasn’t in the best
shape that day.”’

Atkins’ geology professor, Samuel
J. Kozak, also took note of the stu-

dent’s condition. ‘‘He did look
sleepy,’ Kozak said, ‘‘but he was
there.”’

This weeks drop — in
temperature forced the ROTC
cadets inside for some afternoon
training, but an aerobics class
continues to tough it out in the
chill.

Those were just two responses
to the post-Thanksgiving dip of the
mercury, which sent students
scrambling for mufflers, topcoats
and gloves.

Geology Department readings
showed a 38-degree drop in
temperature from Thanksgiving’s
low of 58 degrees to yesterday’s
sub-freezing 20 degrees.

was forced inside the student ac-
tivities pavilion Tuesday after-
noon when the thermometer bot-
tomed at 22 degrees. Capt. Ran-
dall R. Hill notes that ROTC has
few outdoor drills left this term.

Assistant Athletic Director Cin-
da L. Rankin, who teaches an
aerobics class on Mondays and
Wednesdays, said of the weather:
“T suspect it’s going to get worse
before it gets better.”’

Rankin said that despite the
cold, the class is meeting outside
and will continue to do so. ‘‘We’re
planning to keep going outside
unless it’s a real bitter cold,’’ she
said.

OPINION
Restraint of...

The Executive Committee’s decision Monday night to draft
a temporary policy guiding future discussion of open honor
— is a wise attempt to clarify a gray area in the White
Book.

The new policy reminds students that ‘information concer-
ning a student body hearing is considered to be highly con-
fidential within the Washington and Lee community... [and]
should not be published or otherwise transmitted outside the
Washington and Lee community.”’

An ad hoc committee of EC members and publication
editors from the undergraduate and law schools is to recom-
mend a formal policy guiding future publications in their
coverage of student body hearings at next week’s EC
meeting.

Although the statement adpoted at this week’s meeting on-
ly represents the sentiment of the committee, the direction
the EC would like to see a formal statement take is altogether
evident: Don’t publish any information about a hearing that
might expose our system to outside judgment or ridicule.

Such a restraint on the discussion of cases is dangerous and
should be avoided in any and all policies guiding a coverage
of honor trials. The student newspaper does and should serve
as a forum for discussion of campus concerns, and not just
those that the EC deems allowable for consideration. As one
faculty member asked: ‘Does the EC have something to
hide, and if so, should they be allowed to hide it?”’

Where the new policy makes allowance for fruitful discus-
sion of student body hearings is not certain and needs
clarification. Should students and writers only discuss
generalities, or are those even unacceptable, since such
discussion surely leaves the campus in the form of a
newspaper or radio transmission?

While the policy attempts to ban all printed or transmit-
ted discussion of open hearings, it fails — perhaps on pur-
pose — to address any recourse the EC holds in the case of a
violation of the principles of the temporary policy. Since the
statement is not officially part of the White Book — the hand-
book of the Honor System — any punishment outlined in that
booklet holds no bearing. The EC is simply asking that its
policy stand as a decision ‘‘in the best interests of the student
body,”’ as outlined in the Student Body Consitution, until a
future, more permanent guideline can be agreed upon.

We hope that all future policies will continue to deal in the
generalities of this statement, and that any attempts at
outlining specific violations or punishments ought to be
avoided at all costs. To create a tangle of words in such a
policy would serve no purpose.

Additionally, we hope the EC will seriously consider the in-
put of the publication editors with whom they will meet to
hammer out a new policy. Agreement upon a statement will
help to guarantee compliance by publications in the future
and will also help to refine campus discussion of honor mat-
ters.

Dirty laundry

Sometimes, you can’t do anything right.

When the trustees decided to allow the entrance of women
at the undergraduate level, they foresaw many difficulties in
the transition from an all-male school to a coeducational
university. To their credit, they created a committee to
oversee this transition and to try to covercome any obstacles
the school might face.

That committee met faithfully last year, carrying out its
charge with an almost religious zeal for detail and faithful
compliance. So far, coeducation has met with few problems.

But where the committee failed, it failed (?) with a
vengeance, or so the rest of the literate world has been told in
a recently published article on the ‘‘washing machine’
crisis. It seems guys traditionally have done their laundry
less frequently than do the women this year, and the
resulting demand for washers and dryers meant students
were doing their laundry at all hours of the night.

What a failure of the committee! ! What a failure of coedu-
cation! ! Don’t laugh too hard. It might crease your starched
shirts.

Although there were problems with the laundry room in the
basement of Graham-Lees earlier this year, they have been
corrected and were never important enough to warrant an
article that went from The Richmond News Leader to The
Washington Post to an editorial in the Raleigh, N.C., News
and Observer, which said that W&L considers its laundry
problems ‘‘serious.”’

A crisis over laundry machines seems rather trivial in an
age when high schools and universities are graduating in-
creasing numbers of functional illiterates. While we might
not know when to do our laundry, functional illiterates can’t
even read the detergent box listing ‘‘hot, warm, or cold.”’

Unaware W&L students aren’t unusual

 

MY VIEW

By Marie Kothman

 

There’s a trend I’ve noticed among
Washington and Lee freshmen, al-
though I’m sure it’s not limited to
freshmen or W&L. I refer to it as the
“College News Blackout.” It’s not
that we don’t know what’s happening
on campus, but we are appallingly
unaware of world and national news.

During my senior year in high
school, a bright, intelligent friend on
break from college came to visit me.
During the conversation, she noticed
a month-and-a-half-old Time maga-
zine on the coffee table. On the cover

W&L has

MY VIEW
By Tom Maguire

 

 

Thanksgiving Break has come and
(alas) gone, yet the holiday is not so
far in the past that one cannot stop
and reflect on those things that give
us cause to be thankful.

The biggest concern of students,
faculty, and administration at the

was a woman from Bhopal, India.

“Why does she look so sad?” my
friend asked. I explained about the
Union Carbide gas leak and was com-
pletely floored when she said she
hadn’t heard anything about it.

“When you're away at college, you
really don’t hear about what’s going
on,” she said.

Now I know what she meant. In an
effort to keep up with the news, I’ve
subscribed to a daily newspaper. But
often I’m in too much of a rush to get
beyond the headlines or the Far Side
comic strip.

I recently was talking with the wife
of a 1972 W&L graduate (who herself
happens to be a Hollins College grad-
uate). They came to the W&L Home-
coming this year for the first time in
several years. The two biggest
changes they noticed from their stu-
dent generation and ours is that we

dress up for football games (they
didn’t) and that the atmosphere is
less tense than in the early 1970s in
the midst of peace demonstrations.
Perhaps that degree of political
awareness was too much, too fever-
ish. Our ignorance is the other end of
the spectrum. We need to find the
middle.

So often I hear people in the dorms
remarking how unaware we, as col-
lege students, are about world af-
fairs. ‘‘So what’s the deal about this
hijacking?”’ We no longer have Jane
Pauley or David Hartman squawking
at us every morning from the living
room television set, nor do we have
the family Sunday paper to read at
leisure. We once were informed of
world news in rather casual manner,
listening to the radio news while driv-
ing, or overhearing the nightly news
while doing homework.

Now one must make a concerted ef-
fort to watch the nightly news or read
the paper because parties, tests,
papers (and more parties) take
higher priority. In some respects the
cloistered atmostphere is necessary
and beneficial; it is easier to concen-
trate on Keats, calculus and chemi-
cals. Many of the distractions that
were casually informative have been
removed, and while it helps us con-
centrate on one area of learning, it
leaves us ignorant of the “real
world,”

So, as the cliche goes, because we
will be living in the ‘real world,’’ we
should be aware of what is happening
out there. It will affect us. Even it it’s
just a glance at the headlines of a
paper while walking through the li-
brary, or the five-minutes newsbreak
after ‘‘General Hospital,” it’s worth
the effort. Stay informed.

many reasons to give thanks

beginning of the term had to have
been the introduction of coeducation.
We must all be grateful that —
so far — it has worked remarkably
well. True, there have been a few
problems (who worries about laun-
dry?), but surely these have been of a
trivial nature. ‘I'he curmudgeons and
arch-reactionaries who complained
so bitterly about coeducation when it
was first announced have, to their
credit, adapted to change with good
grace. At this point, coeducation is
almost universally considered a
beneficial change.

Another thing to be thankful for is
the conduct of our athletic teams. At
Washington and Lee we have no
scandals (such as those at University
of Florida or Texas Christian Univer-
sity) and no unsportsmanlike behav-
ior (such as Miami’s shocking and
loathsome running up of the score
against Notre Dame). Here, athletes
compete as amateurs in the strictest
sense of the word: they play for love
of the sport, not for money or scholar-
ships. The remarkable success
achieved by our teams does us all
credit.

Finally, we should all be thankful
that so much is being said on the sub-
ject of the Honor System. Many stu-
dents were willing to go on record (by
means of letters to The Ring-tum
Phi) expressing their outrage (justi-
fiably, I think) at the outcome of the
first open honor trial this year. The
discussion prompted by the verdict in
that case cannot help but heighten
awareness of the Honor System,
which in turn will make the system
both more effective and more resi-
lient. That is truly something for
which we can be thankful.

LETTERS

Graffiti embarrasses, damages aesthetics

To the editors:

I would like to publicly address a relatively
“‘minor’’ problem here at W&L a that is mani-
festing itself into a dilemma that poses a fair
amount of concern to me. I am referring to the
existence and increasing incidences of graffiti
(vandalism) that appear on the inside of the
elevator doors in the University Library. It has
been my observation that within the past three or
four weeks these doors have been the focus of
considerable defacement.

It appears that a few members of the student
body (or perhaps some of our so-called guests)
have taken up a hobby that consists of writing
various slogans and ‘‘jokes’’ within plain view of
the elevator passengers. Although some of these
are rather clever from a psychological stand-
point, they can and have become rather offen-
sive, especially to the legitimate guests of the
school, as I am sure you will admit.

As a member of the Student Recruitment Com-
mittee, I am often in the position to see the condi-
tion of our buildings from a perspective that
most students do not possess — specifically, that
of the prospective student and his or her family.
As you may well know from your own exper-
ience, the University Library is a highlight of the
tour that our committee members give to the
prospective student. Taking this into considera-
tion, | am sure you can well imagine the damage
that this ‘‘mess”’ does to the aesthetics of not on-
ly the library but the school as a whole, especial-
ly when one contrasts this to the beauty of the
rest of the campus.

I have encountered many instances over the
past two years where visitors have actually
remarked that they were “‘surprised’’ that the
students here would deface the very objects for
which they have received so much praise. The
extent of this problem has reached the point now
where I will no longer take guests downstairs via
the elevator to show them our study carrels — a
point in the tour, by the way, that I often remark
about how well our well-known Honor System
protects the student from the dishonorable ele-
ments that can exist in academic life.

Let me just say that I feel that this moronic

scribbling has gone on long enough and now must
stop, so that we can maintain the aesthetics of
our school, as well as to provide the members of
the student recruitment committee the chance to
tour our guests without having to hide the embar-
rassing acts of a childish minority of our stu-
dents.

Student questions coverage

To the editors:

I noted with great surprise that The Ring-tum
Phi has again violated the tradition of respect
toward honor hearings before the student body.
This newspaper has long held itself out as a guar-
dian of tradition at Washington and Lee. I see
now, however, that its editors respect only those
traditions that suit their own temperaments. Ap-
parently, the tradition of keeping matters of
honor private within the University is not among
the approved group. Nor is that of respect for the
verdict of a student jury.

Last year, this paper allowed one of its colum-
nists to attack the advocates for the accused in
the year’s sole student body hearing, and was
widely criticized for its indiscretion. This year’s
performance, however, goes far beyond indis-
cretion: The coverage included three front-page
articles, a long editorial, and one letter to the
editor, all referring directly to the hearing, and
between them reciting details of the case, includ-
ing the name of the accused, and indignantly dis-
puting the verdict of the student jury. Tradition,
clearly, along with the reputation of an accused
student, and of the Honor System and the Univer-
sity, is safe in the hands of The Phi only when the
editors are happy with the hearing’s outcome.

That paper raised more issues than I can ad-
dress in one letter, but I must make three brief
points.

First: however we may individually feel about
the verdict of a student jury, it is final and

private, and must be respected as such. If we
know the facts of the case, and disagree with an
acquittal, we are under no obligation to speak to
or associate with the acquitted student. We have
every right — perhaps even a duty — to discuss
our objections with our fellow students, but the
student newspaper, easily accessible to out-
siders, is no place for such discussions.

Second: The editorialist’s shocking assertion,
that ‘Lee and the Honor System ... had nothing
to say about intention or motivation or mitigat-
ing circumstances,”’ is patently ridiculous.
Judgments of honor are based on character, not
on mere deeds considered in a vacuum. In an
honor system, deeds are important only when
considered in the light of motivation and inten-
tion and all the circumstances, as evidence of
character. To say, as the editorialist does, that
“the only relevant question was whether the act
was in fact committed,” is to erect immutable
rules of conduct and defeat one of the chief ad-
vantages of an honor system, its flexibility, and
thus to put every student in peril of automatic ex-
pulsion for an accidental, unintentional, or justi-
fiable breach of those rules.

Third: [The student’s] contention that a theft
must be planned in advance in order to be dis-
honorable is equally ridiculous, and, along with
his suggestion that the Honor System our to app-
ly only ‘within the confines of the University,”
demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of the
concept of honor. For him, apparently, honor has
nothing to do with character or personal morals,
which apply at all times and in all places (why
not make it ‘the whole world,” [name deleted], )
but is merely the ability to restrain oneself from
breaking certain rules while one is on campus.
{The student] would seem to suggest that any
thief is welcome at W&L, as long as he steals on-
ly from townspeople, or steals as soon as the no-
tion strikes him, instead of meditating on the
issue beforehand. One of us has missed the boat
as to honor, apparently. Whichever of us is
wrong ought to think pretty hard about the first
paragraph of the White Book.

Parking fines

fund WWII
scholarships

 

By MATT HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

Would your heart be warmed if you
were to find that the $13,000 collected
in parking fines last year was used to
fund scholarships?

If so, it should get warmer this
year, aS more expensive parking
fines have been implemented to al-
leviate parking problems in Univer-
sity lots, according to University
Proctor Charles F. ‘Murph’ Mur-
ray.

The increases from $1, $5 and $10 to
$5, $15 and $25 are meant to dis-
courage illegal parking by punishing
violators’ checkbooks. Last year,
$13,109 was collected in parking fines
from both students and faculty. Uni-
versity Tresurer E. Stewart Epley
said the fines help fund World War II
Memorial Scholarships.

Why are students willing to shell
out — or charge home — such large
amounts for parking infractions?

“T like to park close,” said
sophomore Porter Davis. “I’m will-
ing to pay the price.”’

Senior Wes Boatwright, who said
he received more than $100 in park-
ing fines last year, added that there
is not enough parking close to the
University.

He said the shortage of spaces at
night may discourage students from
studying at the library or attending
sporting events at the Warner
Center.

Assistant to the President Frank A.
Parsons said two incidents last spr-
ing prompted him to help draft
changes in the parking regulations.

First, he said, emergency vehicles
had difficulty getting to the Com-
merce School, where an alarm had
sounded, because of cars parked il-
legally.

The second reason is his close work
with the Lexington City Council and
Planning Commission regarding
W&L’s development program. The
council was hesitant in approving the
building of a 240-bed dormitory, he
said, until plans for parking for the
proposed building were introduced
by the University.

Murray thinks he has given fewer
tickets this year than he did in the
same period last year. When asked if

 

 

 

 

Security guard Steve Tomlinson gives a ticket (o the

the new system of fines was responsi-

ble for the decline, he replied, ‘‘It’s
helping.”’
According to Murray, 1,107 stu-

dents have parking stickers and
there are close to 600 faculty and
staff personnel with cars. In the
beginning of the year, registration
for students was $20 per car. The
price of stickers is now $10. Murray
said many students bring cars back
to school after Thanksgiving and
Christmas breaks and for spring
term.

The money collected for parking
registration is considered University
income, according to Epley. Murray
said he has turned over more than
$15,000 in registration money to the
Business Office.

Parsons thinks the cause of the
parking squeeze is laziness. Many
people who could easily walk, drive
instead, he said. In fact, some

 

students drive and end up parking
farther away fron yus than they
live, he said joking]

To summarize, he said, ‘We're
spoiled rotten,” and expect a parking
space within feet of tination

Parsons said the key to reducing
parking problems is more efficient
use of the 1,055 exist ne parking
spaces. He said he would like to see
stricter enforcement in the parking

lots.
Parsons explained that
men parking ‘lot bey

the fresh-

md the old

railroad station is rarely used. He
pointed out that the long-standing
tradition allowing dormitory coun-
selors to park next to Graham-Lees is
against regulations and that allowing
counselors to park there causes pro-
blems for Universty Bookstore and

have been attending classes for 10
weeks.

So what was Public Speaking Pro-
fessor Halford R, Ryan doing giving
a speech on the coeducation argu-
ment? The speech was given at one of
the few colleges in the country still
all male — at Ryan’s alma mater,
Wabash College in Indiana.

Ryan returned to Wabash in
Crawfordsville to deliver ‘‘A Rhetori-
cal Analysis of the Coeducational
Argument at W&L.”’

Staff Reports

 

Wabash is an all-male school, as it
was when Ryan graduated from
there in 1966. The school is not
seriously considering coeducaiton,
but the reaction to Ryan’s speech
showed that the possibility is not be-
ing ignored.

‘* ‘Ohs’ and ‘ahs’ came from those
in favor of coeducation,”’ Ryan said,
“but there were several audible
goans as well.”

While at Wabash, Ryan also met
with the Feminine Studies Commit-
tee, was interviewed by the LaFay-
ette, Ind., newspaper and delivered a
lecture on demagogic discourse to a
speech class in persuasion.

Ryan joined the W&L faculty in
1970. He received his M.A. and Ph.D
from the University of Illinois.

Trial coverage
~|discouraged

 

By JASON LISI
Staff Reporter

 

Citing the “‘highly confidential’’
nature of student body hearings, the
Executive Committee Monday ap-
proved a temporary guideline discou-
raging publication of information
from the trials.

The guideline is the EC policy until
a month-old special committee stu-
dying the reporting of honor hearings
can return a decision.

The text of the policy reads: ‘‘Any
and all information concerning a stu-
dent body hearing is considered to be
highly confidential within the Wash-
ington and Lee community; this in-
formation should not be published or
otherwise transmitted outside the
Washington and Lee community.”

EC President John Lewis said the
ruling is ‘‘an explanation of what is
obvious to us but is apparently not ob-
vious to a lot of people.”

Facts from an open honor hearing
and an interview with the acquitted
student were published in the Nov. 14
issue of The Ring-tum Phi. The pre-
vious week, the EC had formed the
subcommitteee, which is composed

of members of the EC, Publications
Board, the W&L Law News and The
Ring-tum Phi. It has not yet met.

Although the guideline is only tem-
porary, the wording will be passed on
to the subcommittee, which is ex-
pected to return a decision at Mon-
day’s meeting.

“I view this as a harmless guide-
line,” EC Vice President Andrew
Caruthers said after the meeting.
“Hopefully this will deter a play-by-
play report of honor trials going out-
side the W&L community.”’

Caruthers said he thought Monday
night’s guideline would be respected
and reflected the feeling of all the
members of the EC. “I think there
was a need to put down in writing the
unanimous feeling of the committee
that information on a student body
hearing is confidential within the
W&L community,” he said.

Caruthers said it would be taking it
“to the extreme” to interpret the rul-
ing as forbidding talking about an
honor trial with a person not connect-
ed with W&L, but that would ‘‘proba-
bly be in the best interest of the ac-
cused and the witnesses.’’

“We're really thinking of the stu-
dent when we do this,” he said.

“You better watch out, you better
not cry, you better not pout ...”’ that’s
right, Santa Claus is coming to town.
The annual Christmas parade will
wind its way through the streets of
Lexington tomorrow evening. And in-
cluded in the procession will be
several Washington and Lee organi-
zations and students accompanying
St. Nicholas in his appearance.

The parade will start at 6:30 p.m.
at the Lexington High School, taking
Houston Street to Main Street. The
parade will travel down Main and
turn right at Court House Square onto
Washington Street, then follow East
Nelson Street to the Maxway/Mick or

Mack parking lot
The grand marshals of the parade

will be the W&L singing group,
Southern Comfort. They will ride in
an open carriage and sing Christmas
carols. They will stop in front of the
judge’s stand which will be located
on the front porch of the First
American Bank.

“T think it’s going to be fun,” said
Bruin Richardson, a member of the
group.

He added that he felt a perfor-
mance such as this will increase the
group’s “name recognition’ within
the Lexington community. He men-
tioned the Southern Comfort’s perfor-
mances around the country had
made the group’s name recognizable
in Lexington and the parade is ‘‘the
kind of thing that will add to that.”’

Richardson said that the group, by
performing in the parade, will be
“ambassadors of the university.” It
will be good for the image of the
students, Richardson said, when
students are seen participating in a
community event, ‘‘instead of stay-
ing in the shells of our frats.”’

The WLUR radio staff will form
what journalism associate professor
Robert J. de Maria called ‘The
WLUR Marching Radio Band.” It
will be composed of members of the
staff marching with ‘boom boxes’
tuned to WLUR, which will be play-
ing Christmas music at the time of
the parade.

De Maria said that the idea, which
originally came from University
Editor Jeffery G. Hanna, would show
a sense of unity between the Univer-
sity and the town of Lexington. ‘The
only thing I’m upset about is that it
wasn’t my idea,’’ he said.

De Maria said six people had sign-
ed up to march by Tuesday. He added
that anyone interested in marching is
welcome and that it seemed like a
good way to begin the evening before
the SAB concert that night with
R.E.M. De Maria said, ‘‘The more
people we have, the more fun we’re
going to have.”’

Members of drama _ professor
Joseph Martinez’s Drama 133 course
will be marching and interacting
with the spectators as ‘clowns.’ Mar-
tinez said that his students will not be
traditional clowns, but rather will be
acting in their own ‘‘comic and sort
of absurd characters.’’ He said that
the students have been developing
these characters with the aid of pro-
fessional actors Tim Carryer and
Babs Bailey who are in Lexington to
perform a play.

Martinez said about 16 to 20 people
will be chosen from the class to
march in the parade and take some
of their ‘personas’ onto the street to
“try and liven things up.”’

He said that this type of acting is
difficult, calling it a ‘‘bath of fire.”’

“There is nothing more challeng-
ing than creating a character in the
studio and taking it out into the
street,” he said. ‘‘It’s really a testing
ground for any persona.”

 

Senior David Sprunt, the 1984-85 Calyx editor, told the
Executive Committee Monday that last year’s year-
book has been completed and sent off to the printer.

He said that according to the publisher, the books
should be ready for distribution by the first or second
week in January.

Juniors Dennis Francis and Charles Nusbaum told
the Publications Board that next year’s book is pro-
ceeding on schedule.

Proofs of senior photographs are available for inspec-
tion and selection in the Calyx office.

Freshmen raise $500 for floods

Over three-quarters of the freshman class went on a
fast the week before Thanksgiving break to aid Rock
bridge County flood victims, and raised more than $500
in the process.

Members of the freshman class agreed to sacrifice
their meal at Evans Dining Hall on Tuesday, Nov. 19.
The raw cost of the food was then donated to the flood
victims, Mike Forrester, the freshman class president
who organized the fast, said 315 students participated in
the fast and raised over $470. In addition, $20 was
donated at the door.

Forrester also negotiated a deal with Domino's Pizza
in which $1 was donated for every large pizza sold at the
W&L dormitories during the fast.

The Minority Student Association also contributed $50
for flood relief.

Oxford program announced

One Washington and Lee student will attend Universi-
ty College, Oxford, next year under the auspices of a
new exchange program established between the two in-
stitutions.

‘We are delighted that Oxford has invited us to par-
ticipate in this new program,” said William J. Watt,
professor of chemistry at W&L. ‘For a number of years
faculty members have benefited from our exchange
program with University and we are pleased to be able
to extend this opportunity to include students."’

Ideally, students should participate during their
junior year. Seniors may be considered in exceptional
cases, but because the Oxford academic year runs from
the first of October until late June, seniors would find it
difficult to complete all required work in time for W&L
commencement,

Additional information may be obtained by contact-
ing Watt.

and deans as well as various civic groups.

UC to review W&L’s campus master plan

 

By JOHN KALITKA
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee’s new dor-
mitory is expected to be a key topic of
discussion when the University Coun-
cil meets today. The body has asked
Executive Assistant to the President
Frank A. Parsons to explain W&L’s
campus master plan, which was ap-
proved by the Lexington City Council
last spring and includes provisions
for new campus housing.

The master plan was compiled and
submitted to the City Council follow-
ing creation of a new “institutional
zone’ within the city limits. The new
zoning ordinance requires the Uni-
versity to submit a master plan de-
scribing all projects and improve-
ments anticipated for roughly the
next 10 years.

“Onee a master plan has been ap-
proved, we do not have to get further
approval ... unless we depart sub-
stantially from the master plan or ...
come within 200 feet of a city street or
200 feet of our property line,” he said.
Parsons also explained that site
plans will have to be submitted on an
individual basis in many instances.

The planning guidelines provide
for improvements and renovations of
existing campus facilities and the
construction of the proposed dormito-
ry and a teaching theater. The follow-
ing list highlights some of the main
proposals:

ACADEMIC FACILITIES:

The master plan shows no growth
in either the main core or Lewis Hall
areas, but does include provisions for
a teaching theater and recommends
renovations to the existing Trou-
bador University Theatre.

Seating 400-450, the proposed facili-
ty would also include shop and design
areas, classrooms, offices, rehearsal
areas, a lecture and seminar room,
and receiving and parking accommo-
dations. The old railroad station and
gasoline storage property across
Route 60 from the Warner Center is
the proposed site for the new teach-
ing theater.

Once the new theater is completed
renovations and improvements are
planned for the current University
Theatre. Possible future uses dis-
cussed for this structure include the
establishment of a University movie
theater.

SPORTS AND RECREATION FA-
CILITIES:

No major changes or additions are
planned within the sports and recrea-
tion areas, although new outdoor
courts and playing fields have been

recommended.

«Renovations and modernization of
locker room and public use facilities
are already underway at Wilson
Field. Improvements are planned for
the press box as well as stadium seat-
ing, and the creation of a new en-
trance court, complete with ticket
booths to be located at the north end
of the pedestrian bridge leading to
Wilson Field.

Additionally, the installation of a
track and field area in the open space
between the stadium and Lewis Hall
is under consideration.

eResurfacing of the existing tennis
courts under the footbridge were
completed last year. Expansion of
this area to include additional court
facilities for such activities as bas-
ketball and volleyball are recom-
mended in the master plan.

eA thorough renovation and up-
grading is proposed for existing
athletic fields as well as the creation
of new field facilities in the open
space adjacent to Route 60 near
Liberty Hall and in the area now ser-
ving as the University dump. The
new fields will probably be soccer,
field hockey, and softball facilities in
anticipation of W&L’s growing coed-
ucational sports programs.

Two satellite structures housing
storage, first aid and restroom facili-
ties will be constructed in conjunc-
tion with the new athletic fields as
well.

HOUSING:

Studies conducted by the Universi-

ty foresee a resident population in-
crease of 240 students in the near
future. To alleviate overcrowding in
the existing dormitory sites, the
master plan recommends a new dor-
mitory.
Once completed the multi-story
structure will provide 240 beds at the
corner of Washington and Nelson
streets. The site was chosen due to its
proximity to campus.

CONSERVATION AND PRESER
VATION:

Preservation of the landscape and
natural beauty of the back campus
area, a vast expanse extending
roughly from Lewis Hall north to the
Maury River, is a key recommenda-
tion of the plan. A conservation
district extending into the developed
campus on either side of Woods
Creek is also proposed. Moreover, a
Liberty Hall “preservation park”
that includes an archaeological ex-
cavation area, laboratory and visit-

ors’ center is under consideration.’

ADMINISTRATIVE FACILITIES:

Renovations and improvements to
existing struotures promise to allevi-
ate overcrowding in Washington Hall

‘French text |
-makes use
of computer =

By SYDNEY MARTHINSON
Staff Reporter

 

 

French professors Russell C.
Knudson and Kathy Koberstein are
co-writing a computer software
package that they say can condense
the amount of grammar that normal-
ly takes one year to teach into one
semester.

The two hope the package will be
published and used with a textbook to
give a fast grammar review to stu-
dents who have had some French in
high school, but not enough to put
them into the intermediate college
class in French.

Though other computer programs
have been published in foreign
language study, Koberstein and
Knudson’s software is innovative
because it was written to go along
with a textbook, and each section
builds on a previous section, while
other programs offer little or no se-
quencing.

Knudson said the most advantage-
ous aspect of the system is that ‘‘stu-
dents receive as much individual at-
tention as possible.”’

He added that with computers
there is immediate feedback so
students are less likely to feel embar-
rassed if they answer incorrectly and
are able to work at their own speed.
Knudson stressed that this allows for
better use of the students’ time.

“The trick is to design materials
where students learn a lot while us-

The program, the result of four to
five hours of daily work over the
summer, is still in its early stages. It
is being implemented in intermed-
iate level French classes at Washing-
ton and Lee, where students’ reac-
tions have been positive, according to
Knudson.

“The program is working better
than we ever thought it would,” he
said. “‘It’s a pleasant surprise.”

need to review their initial program
before submitting it for publishing,
however.

They hope to receive a grant from
W&L awarded to professors for
“scholarly, artistic, and pedagogical
betterment” while working on a
special program that can be im-
plemented into W&L’s curriculum.

If the grant is awarded, the pro-
fessors hope to adapt their program

adapt their work for use on personal

Knudson, who has been teaching
here since 1966, has already publish-
ed a French instructional book with

professor. Called ‘Piste Gram-
maticales,”’ it has been in use at W&L
for five years.

Koberstein, a University of Wis-
consin graduate, began teaching at
W&L in 1984.

“It’s very boring to make them run
indoors on the track,” she noted.

Rankin mentioned that on Monday
some of her students came to class in
shorts, but didn’t complain. ‘“‘Once
we get moving, it gets better,’’ she
said.

“We look like we're half-frozen
when we're running,” she said, ad-
ding the slowness of her students was
due not so much to the cold weather
as to Thanksgiving indulgence.
“‘We’re all a bit sluggish but I think
that’s from too much turkey,”
Rankin said.

She said she is teaching the same
class next term and does not look for-

ward to the weather. “It could be
tough come winter time,”’ she noted.

Some students have a more chari-
table view of the recent weather.

“T like it this cold,” said freshman
Delia Ford. She added the weather
here was much different from the
weather she experienced at home in
Atlanta over Thanksgiving break —
it was so warm her brother went
waterskiing.

Monica Burke, a freshman from
Yardley, Penn., compared the Vir-
ginia weather to the temperatures at
home. “‘I knew it was probably about
the same here as it is up there,” she
said.

She added the cold weather in the
mornings was “‘invigorating.”’

Ford remarked that although the
outside weather was cold, the dormi-
tories were much warmer. “I have

my window open all day,” she said.

Cagers tame top-rated Tigers

 

By DAVID EMRICH
Staff Reporter

 

Facing the conference’s top-rated
team is a difficult experience for any
team, much less one as young as this
year’s W&L basketball squad. But
Tuesday night, with an assist from
the crowd, the Generals came
through against the Tigers of
Hampden-Sydney and recorded a
65-57 victory in the season’s first Old
Dominion Athletic Conference con-
test.

W&L was rated seventh in the pre-
season ODAC poll, but handled the
adversity as if the predicted finishes
for the Tigers and the Generals were
reversed, a turn of events that pleas-
ed W&L head coach Verne Canfield.
“The team showed a lot of poise and
togetherness.”” he said. ‘But,’ he
cautioned, ‘‘there is still a long way
to go.”’

When the teams took the court for
the opening tip-off, it was clear which
side had the physical advantage.
Hampden-Sydney fielded a front line
which averaged 6-5, 210 lbs. com-
pared to a 6-5, 185 lb. average front
line for W&L. Yet, the Tigers’ size
didn’t seem to bother the Generals.

W&L stayed right with the Tigers
and began to force their opponents in-
to mistakes. In one three-minute
span midway through the first half,
the Tigers turned the ball over four
times and were whistled for a 3-
second violation. The Generals took
advantage of the Tiger’s errors to
build a 20-10 lead before Coach Don
Thompson called a timeout to re-
group his team, with 9:30 to go in the
half.

Up to that point, Hampden-Sydney
had spent most of its time attempting
to force the ball inside to its leading
scorer, John Lee (averaging 15.3
points per game) and the Generals
had spent most of their time prevent-
ing the Tigers from doing so.

After the time out, however, the
Tigers’ Ralph Baker, who finished
with 10 points, hit from the right cor-
ner to pull Hampden-Sydney to with-
in eight. Next, the Tigers forced a
turnover that led to a basket and
reduced the deficit to six. But, that
was as close as they were to get in the
first half.

The Tigers could do no better than
to keep pace with the Generals for
the remainder of the half, and W&L
took a 30-24 léad to the locker room.

At the start of the second half
Hampden-Sydney seemed to have ad-
justed their strategy. They began
taking more shots from outside, and
seemed to be having some success.
They outscored W&L 12-7 over the
first five minutes of the second half,
and were within one point when
Thompson called a timeout with
14:30 remaining.

The Tigers began forcing the ball
inside again, but the Generals re-
mained equal to the task. They got
Hampden-Sydney’s big gun Lee to
foul out with about 10 minutes re-

The Ring-tum Phi, December 5, 1985

 

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

Sophomore guard Steve Hancock leaps out of bounds to save the ball Tuesday night

maining. He was not a factor in Tues-
day night’s game, taking only two
shots from the field and not scoring
before his departure.

With the score tied at 43, the crowd
began to make themselves apparent.
Said Canfield, ‘‘The crowd was ex-
cellent, they were just great.’’ The
Generals used the momentum
created by the partisan fans to jump
to a 53-47 with four minutes remain-
ing. This spurt included scoring by
the Generals’ Steve Hancock, who
led both teams with 22 points, and
point guard Fred Bissinger, who con-
tributed eight baskets.

The Tigers continued to fight back,
riding Chris Sibold’s 14 points in the
second-half to tie the score at 53 with
two minutes left in the contest. Can-
field stopped play with a time out.

After play resumed, the Tigers
became very sloppy, committing
nine fouls in the remaining time. The
Generals took advantage of the op-
portunity, sealing the win by scoring
eight of their last 10 points from the
free throw line.

Despite the size disadvantage, the
Generals were able to keep the
Tigers’ big men from doing much
damage on the inside. Canfield said,
“We appealed to the players’ pride,
and their ability to execute. That was
how we did that. I was very pleased
with the way that they responded.”’

Thompson simply said, ‘‘They out-
hustled us inside, that was how they
beat us.””

Tuesday’s win evens the W&L
mark at 2-2. Over the Thanksgiving
break, the Generals went 1-2, in-
cluding a third-place finish in the
season-opening W&L Pizza Hut Tip-

Grapplers open season
with Saturday’s Invitational

 

By CHARLES T. GAY
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team will attempt to continue its win-
ning trend of the past several years
as it opens its season Saturday with
the eight-team W&L Invitational.

Coach Gary Franke assessed the
tournament as ‘‘a good early-season
test for us.’’ Franke said he expects
the tough competition to come from
Gettysburg, Hiram and York.

Still, he said, ‘‘We hope to be in the
thick of things in the championship
finals.”

In addition to the three favorites,
four other squads will visit Lex-
ington. Longwood, Loyola, Muhlen-
berg and Scranton round out the
field.

W&L was to have wrestled Hamp-
den-Sydney last night, but that school

Wrestling coach Gary Franke has high hopes for grapplers

et’s remember:
coach’s success

is not in fine print

...It seems somewhere along the
line we've lost sight of what a coach
is supposed to do. The rash of college
football firings and “resignations”
during Turkey Week brought me ter-
rible nightmares of the world being

TIME
OUT....

 

 

quality in terms of how large the numeral under the ‘“‘W”’ in the sports
pages’ fine print is).

Look, when I was growing up, a coach’s job was to be the guy in
charge, not the guy whose job it was to win games. Doesn’t it make
sense anymore to talk about ‘‘It’s not whether you win or lose, but how
you play the game’’? It seems not. It seems that if you don’t win, you
don’t get to stay.

Oh, well, I guess it makes sense. The world of sports has gone the
way where every other thing is a dollar sign. You don’t win, nobody
goes to the football games, the alumni stop sending those nice, fat
“donations,”’ and Keith Jackson and Frank Broyles don’t come knock-
ing on your stadium door anymore. And, heavens, we all know what
a terrible fate that would be. So, we might as well get rid of the coach if
he’s not winning games.

Very fine. In the meantime we’ve got coaches like hapless Bob Cur-
tis. Pity Bob, or at least take note and wonder where this whole mess is
headed. Bob was the coach at Bucknell, Most of us don’t even know
what a Bucknell is, but they play football there. Of the Division I-AA
variety (a merciful division the NCAA powers-that-be created in 1978
for those football teams that couldn’t throw the money, er, uh weight
around with the best of them).

Even though Bob’s had the longest tenure (11 years) of any previous
Bison football coach, his 48-56-3 record over the last five years wasn’t
good enough. Well, let’s put it this way, it wasn’t good enough for Bob.
Said the resigned coach in a prepared statement: ‘I thought I could
win here, I really believed it.’’

You have to say there’s something seriously wrong with life when
the first words out of a coach after his resignation have to do with wins
and losses. And especially when that coach is from something called
Bucknell. It’s scary to me because I remember when a coach con-
sidered it a good day’s work when that slow offensive lineman got
through the agility drills without looking like a bear on roller skates.
(If you’re looking for that statistic in the fine print the morning after
the game, it’s not there.)

On top of all this nonsense, we get these words of wisdom from Bruce
Corrie, athletic director at Bucknell: ‘“‘But even bigger schools with
huge football budgets [the Bison program is not one of those unlimited
resources programs] have found out that simply running out and hir-
ing a hotshot coach doesn’t always guarantee a successful program.”’

Unless I’m mistaken, somewhere success and wins and losses have
come to mean the same thing. Call me old-fashioned, but I don’t buy
that. What’s worse about this attitude is that it has started to take hold
of what coaches think their job is. Curtis’ statement indicates that not
winning seemed to go hand-in-hand with not enjoying your job. Sure,
wins feel better than losses, but if that has become your only yardstick
by which you judge what you do, then you’re in the wrong profession,
sir.

Let’s see that next time before we become so quick to judge the
coach, we try to remember that wins and losses don’t make the man
It’s the things you don’t see that are the real measure of a coach...

....In our trip down the Colonnade this week, a word that we not jump
to any undue conclusions regarding the hoops squad. Tuesday’s was a
big one, but let us let them go at their own pace...Grapplers will have a
tough act to follow (looking at the last two seasons). A trip by the
Warner Center Saturday should give inquiring minds an ideaas to the
strength of this year’s squad.....

....Zounds! $255,000 for a half a round of golf ain’t bad. What I’m
wondering is why it’s so appealing to watch a foursome of multi-
millionaires faced with the pressure (?) of making a putt for $150,000.

Dudek who?

Weaver does it Dad’s way to lead nation

 

' By STEVEN POCKRASS
, Special to The Phi

 

‘

Daniel Weaver ran down the damp wooden bleachers,
across the soggy cinders and onto waterlogged Wilson
Field as the final seconds ticked off the scoreboard. Into
"Weaver's arms jumped his little boy, Kevin, and the
“father bounced all 6 feet 3 inches and 205 pounds of him
‘up and down in the air like a baby.
Even from a distance, one could see the thick veins
running across 20-year-old Kevin Wayne Weaver’s mud-
‘caked forearms and hear his whoops of joy. On that day,
Nov. 16, the junior tailback from Martinsburg, W.Va.,
_ broke W&L’s single-season rushing record with 1,161
yards and raised his single-season scoring record to 110
‘points.
This week, Weaver can celebrate the announcement of
the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s final Divi-
“sion III football statistics, numbers that put the W&L
+ junior first in the land in scoring with an average of 13.8
, Points per game. Weaver also ended the year as the na-
tion’s fourth leading rusher at 145.1 yards per Saturday
» afternoon.
. Weaver’s first-place rating in scoring places him a
notch above Plymouth State’s Joe Dudek. Dudek was
* featured on the cover of this week’s Sports Illustrated as
, the magazine’s choice to win the Heisman Trophy.
But rather than boast about his accomplishments,
* the soft-spoken Weaver saves all his praise for others.

The person who receives most of that praise is his
.father, a General Motors supervisor who played running
back while enlisted in the Air Force.
“He’s my biggest fan, critic, friend,”” Weaver said.
, “Everything I’ve ever done, I owe to him.”’

+ Weaver is very close to his parents, Daniel and
_ Mildred Weaver, and to his 12-year-old sister, Pamela.
His family has missed only five W&L football games in
* three years.
, Kevin was only 7 years old when his father began
coaching him in football, but Daniel Weaver started
‘ teaching his son about the game of life even earlier.
, Weaver said his father has always stressed academics
as his first priority. A chemistry major and ROTC
“scholarship recipient whose sights are set on medical
* school, Weaver juggled 24 hours of classes and labs
_ along with football this season. He also commits time to
the Rangers, an elite group of military science students.
* Schedule conflicts forced him to miss 10 of the football
, team’s 18 practice hours per week. Fallon said he was
worried that the lack of practice would cause Weaver to
" get injured or that he would be unfamiliar with the
. plays.

But Weaver kept himself in strong enough physical
’ shape and learned the plays on his own to compensate
, for the missed practice, Fallon said. Although his heavy

workload limited his social life to perhaps one movie a
«week during the football season, Weaver said he did not
feel pressured to cut back.

“T had to do it in high school,” he said. ‘It was just a
matter of carrying it all over.”’

As a senior at Martinsburg High School, he was an All-
‘Conference football player both offensively and defen-
_Sively, an All-State linebacker, student body president

and a member of a traveling school chorus.

» He’s wanted to go to medical school and play college
football ever since he was a tot. ‘‘I wanted to do both, soI

,

 

i

 

did both and I’m doing both,” he said with quiet deter-
mination.

This mix of quiet confidence, hard work, humility and
desire has earned Weaver praise and respect both on
and off the field.

“The thing that’s most impressive is his attitude,”
said Lt. Col. Luke B. Ferguson, who sat on Weaver’s
ROTC scholarship review board. “He just has a go-
getter’s attitude. He’s always up.”’

“The kids really respect him not only as a fine athlete
but as a person,” said Fallon.

The star tailback recently was elected a tri-captain of
the 1986 football squad, yet he credits much of this year’s
success to the blocking of senior running back Frank
Surface and a maturing offensive line that Fallon said
will lose only one player to graduation.

Fallon had planned to go with a pass-oriented offense
this year, but when opposing defenses began multiple
coverage of W&L’s receivers on both ends, the Generals
switched to an up-the-middle running game.

As Weaver began compiling rushing statistics that put
his name on the USA Today scoreboard, defenses began
keying on him and W&L was forced to open up its pas-
sing attack again.

Weaver said the added pressure psyched him up and
made him play better. He scored a W&L record five
touchdowns against Hampden-Sydney on Oct. 19 and set
another record the following week with 225 yards against
the University of the South.

He was named the Old Dominion Athletic Conference
Player of the Year about two weeks ago. Fallon said he
congratulated Weaver the day after the announcement,
and Weaver thanked him but was disappointed because

more of the offensive linesmen were not recognized by
the conference.

“Tf the team is doing well, I’m happy,’’ Weaver said
recently as he rested his long, blue-jean-covered legs on
a wooden table outside the Co-op. As passers-by stopped
to exchange greetings, his friendly disposition, close-
cropped hair, frameless eyeglasses and blue denim
jacket plastered with buttons bearing such sayings as
“A Hug Will Make My Day” and “I’m Worth Waiting
For’”’ belied his reputation as a mean football monster.

But make no mistake about it — Weaver is big, fast,
strong and well-proportioned. His broad shoulders taper
to a 32-inch waist, and he said he has bench-pressed 300
pounds and has run the 40-yard dash in 4.58 seconds.

Behind solid blocking, this combination of speed,
strength and the ability to fake and cut has made
Weaver successful, Fallon said.

Although Weaver started playing baseball even before
he picked up the pigskin, football has always been his
favorite sport. His senior year in high school, he decided
to run track to build up more speed for college football
rather than return to play first base for a state runner-up
baseball squad.

Weaver had once planned to play linebacker for Divi-
sion I-AA James Madison University in Harrisonburg.
But when two players who were not expected to enroll
accepted soholarhips there, his scholarship offer was
withdrawn.

Weaver said that since he could not play Division |
football where he wanted, he decided to go where he
would receive the best education. He played mostly
special teams as a freshman at W&L and made his

presence known with a school record 100-yard kickoff
return.

“‘T broke to the outside, and there was nothing but open
space,’’ remembers Weaver, the only freshman to letter
on offense that year.

As a sophomore, he played both offense and defense,
but he was used strictly as an offensive weapon this
year.

Weaver had a fine season in 1985, but it wasn’t perfect.
The toughest game for him was the opening contest, a
30-0 drubbing at the hands of ODAC rival Emory &
Henry College. He had to watch the entire game from
the sidelines as he waited for torn cartilage in his knee to
heal. The next week, W&L had an open date, and Failon
thinks the extra rest helped Weaver.

Coming off the injury, Weaver rushed for more than
100 yards in eight consecutive games. With statistics like
that, Fallon said, Weaver is fully recovered from the in-

Jury.
“If he isn’t, I’m waiting for him to get healthy,”’ he
said.

After graduating from W&L, he plans to attend medi-
cal school, fulfill his military obligation and practice or-
thopedic surgery. Although professional football is a
longshot, a scout from the Pittsburgh Steelers watched
Weaver during a practice when he was a sophomore and
complimented him on his play

Fallon said the possibility is there, but ‘‘the competi-
tion is just phenomenal. He’s gotta look like a man play-
ing [against] little boys.”’

“If I could go, I’d go,” said Weaver without any hesita-
tion. ‘‘If they would have me, I’d definitely go.”

On Saturday, the men’s team came
up with a surprising victory over
powerful Division II team, Shippens-

proached the meet as a chance to get
some experience and to do so, Remil-
lard changed the team’s line-up.
While the team had not scouted Ship-
pensburg, it inadvertently struck at
the visitor’s weaknesses. These
changes, according to Remillard,
combined with outstanding perfor-
mances across the board, brought
the men their second victory of the
season.

“‘We did to them what Hopkins did
to us,”’ Remillard said of the meet.
“And it was not just our senior play-
ers but our freshmen. We are pegin-
ning to look like an experienced
team.”

New bands rock the halls Xmas Weekend

Minutemen
‘jam econo’

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Music Critic

 

There is no need to look toward the
British anymore for vital, current
pop music. All the good stuff is being
brewed right here in America.

In fact, there is a new wave of in-
dependent artists who bypass the
rock music industry and take their
music straight to the people. Led by
R.E.M., this new movement has
created a string of bands that repre-
sent the healthiest trend in rock
musie since the punk movement of a
decade ago

There is probably no other group
that epitomizes this new trend better
than the Minutemen, who will open
tomorrow night for R.E.M. Formed
in a backyard of San Pedro, Calif.,
this feisty trio has been putting out
brittle, uncompromising music for
five years now.

“We like the idea of punk rock —
where anybody gets to play’’ bassist
Mike Watt said in a recent interview
with The Ring-tum Phi. ‘‘We don’t
think there’s a ‘punk rock’ musical
style.”

Trying to describe the music that
Watt, guitarist-vocalist D. Boon, and
drummer George Hurley make is no
easy matter. They called themselves
the Minutemen originally because
that was how long all their songs
were. But their music has evolved in-
to a punk, funk, jazz, rock avant-
garde, pop package that climbs into
your head and threatens to stay
forever. You have to hear it to
understand it.

‘‘We juxtapose all kinds of stuff,’
said Watt. ‘‘We use anything we can
to get people to hear our heartbeat.”’

The Minutemen’s motto is, ‘We
Jam Econo.”’ Watt explained what it
meant.

 

 

 

 

 

The Minutemen, a California punk band

“Twenty-five gigs in 25 days,’’ he
laughed. ‘‘And.a lot of those gigs are
two sets. We have no road crew —
just a sound man. So we all share
driving ‘

The group has released nine
records on the independently-based
SST label and has managed to clear a
profit on each one, even though none
of their records have even touched a
Billboard chart. How do they do it?

Simple. They jam econo.

For instance, their break-through
double record, ‘‘Double Nickels on
the Dime”’ was recorded for $2,000 —
all 45 tracks! Their latest Ip, ‘“Three
Way Tie for Last’ only cost them
$1,800.

Watt says the new album is a ‘‘real
Minutemen record.” It has 16 tracks,
5 of them covers, including a Minute-
men version of Creedence Clearwa-
ter Revival’s ‘Have You Ever Seen
The Rain?’ Judging from a preview
listen of the album’s single — a D.
Boon composition called ‘‘Courage”’
— the new record might be the com-
mercial breakthrough that they've
been uh,...avoiding.

‘All we want to do is more records
and more gigs,”’ said Watt. ‘“Money
ain’t gonna save us. I think if we had
a million dollars, D. Boon would be a
million and a half in the hole!”’

SST, their record company, was
started by Black Flag guitarist Greg
Ginn because, as Watt said, ‘‘Nobody
else would put out our music. We
want to make sure it’s done the right
way, so we doit ourselves.”

The Minutemen’s lyrics are didac-
tic, beatnik poetry that attack the
social conscience. The uncompromis-
ing political nature of their music
might put off some listeners, but
Watt probably likes it that way.

“We like the liberal idea of being
tolerant of each other,” he added.
The ’80s aren’t so tolerant, especially
on the college campuses — very
right-wing and preppy. But we think
we can change that.”’

With the increased attention the
group has been receiving lately, they
might just shake some things up
after all. Many consider the Minute-
men one of America’s best bands.
They are not to be missed; their live
show is supposed to be similar to
kissing a locomotive or something.
Let Watt explain.

“There is an atmosphere these
days that is ripe and conducive to
playing gigs if you’re some weird,
lame dude who looks like a trash col-
lector,” he said. ‘‘And we're lucky
for that.”’

R.E.M. leads new wave of American bands

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Editor

A word to the wise Christmas-
concert-goer: The show will be only
as good as you make it. R.E.M.
makes it clear that the success of
their performance lies in the people
in attendance.

“The audience has everything to do
with it,” R.E.M. drummer Bill Berry
told The Ring-tum Phi. “Their reac-
tion makes the show for us. The
quality of the show really does de-
pend on the audience.”

Spectators, then, should go tomor-
row with an open mind and be ready
for anything. In the Nov. 7 Rolling
Stone, bassist Mike Mills recounts a
show in Buffalo, N.Y., at which the
band played only about five of its own
tunes.

When disgruntled fans asked for
their money back, Mills told them
they were ‘missing the point.”’

we were piaying rock and roll,
and we gave everything we had for
it,” he said.

It is perhaps that commitment to
music for music’s sake that makes
R.E.M. unique. Although their latest
album, “Fables of the Reconstruc-
tion,” sold 300,000 copies in three
months and the band sells out places
like New York’s Radio City Music
Hall, commercial success is not their
driving force, they claim.

“My biggest goal isn’t to be num-
ber one,’’ lead singer Michael Sipe
told the Los Angeles Times. ‘‘It’s to
be able to think in 10 years from now,
I'll be able to listen to our third
album and not be embarrassed by
it.”

“We're not a singles band,” Berry
echoes. ‘‘ ‘Fables’ is a theme album,
meant to be taken as a whole. It’s a
narrative in itself,”’

“First and foremost, we want to
make music,”’ he added. “If we get

 

Aen ct

 

rich along the way, that's great. We,
do it because around the corner is
another thrill, not another thousand’
bucks.”’ ‘
The four men of R.E.M. have come,
a long way since their 1980 formation
in Athens, Ga., and the memories of °
the early University of Georgia trat+
gigs remain
“The college thing has always been
our forte,"’ Berry said. ‘We'll never**
forget our roots.”’ ‘
So big, bad R.E.M. coming to little
ole Lexington is not as incongruous *
as you might think. Berry said the,»
band likes playing in smaller arenas Z
“We like the intimacy,” he said
“We don’t like playing when it’s jam- +
packed and there are a bunch of Nazi ,
security men all over the place.”
Keeping that good college spirit, ’
Berry makes this recommendation to |
those joining him tomorrow night in
the pavilion: ‘Drink lots of beer and *
have lots of fun.”

Planning for 1986 Superdance progressing very smoothly

 

 

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

Superdance-bound Xenon performed last night in GHQ.

 

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Editor

 

The 1986 Muscualr Dystrophy
Superdance is more than a month
and a half away, but the dance
organizers have been hard at work
since September preparing for the
event.

Co-chairmen Paul James and San-
dy Whann head up a committee of
nearly 40 people that will make
Washington and Lee’s 30-hour dance
marathon a reality. Both chairmen
agree that things so for have been
running smoothly.

“Things have been really steady,”
James said, ‘‘and we’ve gotten a lot
of good participation.”

“Everything is going really well,”’
Whann agreed. ‘Our controllable
factors are looking strong.”’

By “controllable factors,’’ Whann
said he was referring to the coordina-
tion of the food and refreshments for
the dance, the obtaining of prizes for
dancers and the booking of bands for
the weekend’s entertainment.

All these factors are important
parts of what makes the W&L Super-
dance a successful fundraiser. The
majority of the money made for the
Muscular Dystrophy Association
comes from those people who actual-

ly dance. The food and refreshments
are necessary to take care of the
dancers during the dance itself. The
prizes act as incentives for people to
dance and to reward the dancers that
raise the most money. The bands not
only entertain the dancers, but they
also bring in spectators and more
money for MDA.

Whann said there was no way they
could prepare for everything, but
they look at each year as a building
year and try learn from the past
Superdances for improving ideas.

This year’s dance will see a
number of improvements over
dances of the past. For the second
year in a row, the dance will be held
in the student activities pavilion, and
great thought has gone into the pick-
ing of the date.

“In past years, the Superdance has
fallen on the breaks of one and
sometimes two of the women’s col-
leges,”’ James said. “‘That cuts down
on the participation, but this year
we've made sure there are no con-
flicts.”’

James said he hopes the January
24-26 scheduling will prove to be a
“big weekend back’’ for the local
schools. As well as improved sched-
uling, Superdance ’86 will also be see-
ing improved entertainment.

“These bands are the best we’ve
ever had at Superdance,”’ James

Family viewing hour brings out the worst

 

 

By BILL HANNA
Television Critic

 

It was the last Saturday of break and my folks
decided to have a nice dinner and convinced the
kids to sit around the house for the last night of the
holiday.

We had a fire in the fireplace and had rented a
movie or two for the evening, but it took a little
while to get everyone together to start the movie.
One sister or another stayed on the phone getting
that last bit of phone use in before going back to
school where the thing costs money to use. This led
to watching a few shows I usually don’t have time
to watch.

The show selection was made more by the net-
works than anyone, as CBS had ‘‘Airwolf”’ on at 8
and ABC brought back ‘‘The Fall Guy” for an epi-
sode. NBC was the only thing left and had ‘‘Gim-
me a Break!” It is a good show, but I refused to
watch it because its star, Nell Carter, is just too
darn huge to watch for any length of time. Luckily,
an old episode of ‘‘The Honeymooners’”’ was on.

At 8:30, I wasn’t so lucky and ended up changing
the channel back to NBC for ‘‘Facts of Life,’’
against my better judgment.

As soon as I began watching the show, I began to
remember how bad the few episodes were I had

watched. The familiar faces of Mrs. Garrett,
Blair, Jo, Natalie and Tootie (nice name) appear-
ed on the screen and I almost turned the tube off
and went to do a little studying. This idea was

almost instantly dismissed and I watched the
whole thing.

The show was avuut au vu .viend of Mrs. Gar-
rett’s who comes in for a visit and ends up accus-
ing Mrs. Garrett of having an affair with her late
husband.

Mrs. Garrett and the girls were shocked and
could not believe that the accusation could have
been true.

As expected, the suspicion was unsound and the
show wrapped up with a traditional heart-warm-
ing conclusion.

In short, I thought the show was stupid. Sure, it
may appeal to the intelligence of some of the avid
TV viewers, but it is probably shown past that
specific group’s bedtime.

The next thing on NBC was ‘‘The Golden Girls.”
It turned out to be a much better show with a few
good laughs in it.

The show is about three older women. Dorothy is
played by Bea Arthur, Rose by Betty White and
Blance by Rue McClanahan. These three share a
house, Dorothy’s mother, Sophia, played by
Estelle Getty, makes frequent appearances.

Some of the best lines of the show were those of
Sophia as her caustic personality makes for some
unexpected and funny comments.

The show ended up being fairly entertaining
Although I don’t think I would make a point of
staying home to watch it, it is worth watching if
you happen to feel like just sitting around,

How about that game Monday night? ABC had
its usual announcers as Marino and the Dolphins
picked apart that ever-shifting Chicago defense
we have heard so much about. We even got to see
the start of William Perry's acting career as he
gave a stunning performance in that McDonald's

commercial.

The highlights on the tube this week are few, but
there are some good shows on.

Saturday- The afternoon gives John Wayne fans
a choice of three of his movies as channel 12 will
show the Duke in ‘Sands of Iwo Jima”’ at noon fol-
lowed by ‘‘Flying Leathernecks”’ at 2. Channel 5
will show Wayne starring in ‘‘The Alamo,’ a film
he also directed, at 2.

Sunday- CBS captured my eye for tonight with
something called ‘‘All Star Party for ‘Dutch’ Rea-
gan” at8 as some of the stars come out ina special
honoring Reagan for his work in show business
before he went into politics. Frank Sinatra will
host the show and the only time Reagan will be
called Mr. President will be in a speech by
Charlton Heston. The rest of the time he will be
“Dutch.”

Also on CBS will be the event people wait each
year to see. At 9, the tenth annual ‘Circus of the
Stars’ will be on. This could have its better
moments. Christopher Atkins will be in a cage
with 10 tigers and lions. Mary Hart will be on a
high-wire. Olympic skater Scott Hamilton will be
shot from a cannon. These situations will most
probably be harmless so some of the expectations
of Atkins being torn up or Hamilton missing the
net will probably never oocur

Monday- CBS will start its two-day mini-series
‘Alice in Wonderland.’ The show has plenty of
stars and has possibilities. It will be on from 8 to 10
on both Monday and Tuesday nights.

Tuesday- Barbara Walters has another one ot
her specials on ABC tonight at 10. The show looks
like it will be interesting. The guests are Cybill
Shepherd, Angela Lansbury and Michael J. Fox

boasted.This year’s dance will
features the White Animals, Xenon,
The Maxx and Spark Plugs.

Another big addition tothis year’s
dance is the raffling of a 1986 Handa
Civic. The car was donated by Paul
James Sr. and Milam Turner Jr. '54
of Turner Honda in Selma, Ala.

The car give-away is unique to this
year’s dance. Chances to win are
available for $5.

Other prizes being given away in-
clude a four-day, three-night trip for
two to the U.S. Virgin Islands as well
as trips to New York, Washington,
D.C., and Florida.

It is important to remember that
the car, the bands and the trips are
all designed to increase the support
for one thing — the fight against mus-
cular dystrophy. Whann points out
that the succes of the fight depends
on the cooperation of a great number
of people.

“It’s not the committe that makes
this dance a success — it’s the com-
munity that does,”’ he said.

Whann stressed the support from
area merchants in providing food
and money donations and named sev-
eral examples of support from the
W&L community.

“We get monetary contributions
from the fraternities that help offset
some of out major expenses’’’ Whann
said. ‘‘We also hope that all 17 frats

W&L graduates Eric Heinsohn and
Roger Day have been donating their
time playing their acoustic guitars at
organizing functions and will also be
playing the Saturday afternoon of the
dance.

While the community support is a
great help to the success of the
dance, the best support comes from
those who come out and dance for the
30 hours.

“It’s a damn good time,” Whann
said.

“It is a blast,’’ James agreed. ‘‘It
gets tiring, but it’s well worth it.
When it’s all over you feel like you’ve
done something because you've
danced for 30 hours to help someone
out there who will probably never be
able to do that.”’

Whann points out that you don’t
have to have a date to participate in
the dance and stressed that it’s a
good way to meet new people.

Anyone interested in dancing
should pick up an information packet
before the trip home for Christmas,
Whann suggested. He said that was a
dancer can get donations from people
back home as well as members of the
W&L community.
