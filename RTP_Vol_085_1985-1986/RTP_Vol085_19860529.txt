Board OKs Division Ill lax status

‘

, By SEAN BUGG
Staff Reporter

 

.

 

The Washington and Lee lacrosse
*team will be classified as a Division
, II team next season pending NCAA

approval, the Board of Trustees
decided Saturday.

» The trustees made the decision
after the University Athletic Com-
‘mittee made a unanimous recom-
smendation for the change. The pro-
posal was presented to the board by
"University President John D. Wilson.

* “The Athletic Committee submit-
sted an extremely thoughtful pro-
posal,” Wilson said. “The board
‘agreed that the trend toward increas-
‘ed subsidization in Division I
lacrosse is not a direction Washing-
ton and Lee is prepared to follow.”

Professor Barry F. Machado, head

‘of the Athletic Committee, said he

,was in “complete agreement” with
the trustees’ action.

“I think the proper decision was
»made,”’ he said, adding that the
, lacrosse team’s ‘‘fortunes will be in-
creased .””

However, Machado does not expect
+ the team to see a sudden turn-around
in the first season of Division III
play. ‘‘I think that’s too much to ex-
*pect,”’ he said. :
* Machado believes it could take two
_or three years for the change to make
a measurable improvement.

Sororities
may form
within year

, By SEAN BUGG

‘

 

 

National sororities could be con-
* ducting rush activities to form col-
, onies at Washington and Lee some-

time in the next year, according to
» Associate Dean of Students Anne
_ C.P. Schroer.

An advisory committee consisting
‘of faculty, administrators and
, Students may be named within the

week, she said. Its function will be to
* help select the sororities that come to
.« W&L and to attend the sororities’

presentations to help the students
"pick the ones best for them and the
+ University.

“There’s potential, I think, for
winter rush or spring rush,’’ Schroer
* said, adding that ‘the women so far
sare determined not to have fall

rusb”’ in order to minimize
* academic conflict.

* Schroer said her job was not ac-
, tually to bring sororities to campus,
but to “be supportive” of any group
* of women wanting to form a sorority.
» “I’ve worked pretty closely with
the women during spring term,” she
* said. ‘The University made a deci-
, sion before I came here that if
women wanted to colonize they would
* support it.”
. Schroer said that when colonies are
formed, much of the advice they
* receive will come from the sororities’
+ national organizations.

The new dean of fraternity affairs
* will need to work closely with the
+ women wanting to form a sorority,
, Schroer said.

‘Board appoints
‘Phi co-editors

Journalism majors Sean Bugg and
Jason Lisi were named co-editors of
‘next year’s Ring-tum Phi by the
, University Publications Board on
Monday,
Bugg, a rising sophomore from
, Fredonia, Ky., is a staff reporter for
the paper, and Lisi, a rising junior
* from Hockessin, Del., is the paper’s
» news editor.
Rising senior Greg Turley of
* Austin, Texas, was appointed Phi
+ business manager. The three become
members of the Publications Board.
‘Also appointed was rising senior
+ Hank Greenberg of Naples, Fla., to

.

_ Calyx business manager. A Calyx

editor or editors will be named in the
fall

for reclassification with the National
Collegiate Athletic Association by
June 1 for the change to take effect
next season.

Athletic Director William D.
McHenry said he plans to talk to the
NCAA yesterday to find out all the
details on how to file the application.

“I plan to submit that application
this week,’’ McHenry said.

McHenry was also pleased with the
change, saying, “I very much
favored the change from Division I to
Division III.”’

McHenry supported the change
because players were not getting
positive reinforcement in the form of
post-season play or All-America
honors, as well as not being able to
compete for a conference crown.

With the division change, th
lacrosse team will be competing in
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference and will also be eligible to
compete for the NCAA Division III
national championship.

@

The last time the Generals were in-
vited to participate in the Division I
tournament was 1980.

Nine of the University’s men’s
teams compete in the ODAC, not in-
cluding lacrosse.

The change to Division III will
mean the lacrosse team will have to
schedule more than half its op-
ponents from Division III. In Division
III, no athletic grants-in-aid are
awarded to students. All financial aid
is based on the student’s need.

The move: everybody’s two cents’ worth

for favoring the move, while those who opposed the ac-
tion mentioned the prestige of a Division I program as
justification for keeping the team as it is. Others merely
accepted the change as inevitable.

There has been a change on campus, and like any
other change, it has not gone unnoticed.

In the 1987 season the Washington and Lee lacrosse
team will compete in Division III, having made the
decision to change divisions earlier this week,
something that is bound to elicit response from the

Most people who said they supported the move cited
the ability to better compete on the Division III level
and the chance for a national title as the main reasons

A majority of players supported the move, saying
that playing in Division I was an uphill battle.

“Tt was a good decision, no doubt,” said sophomore
midfielder Greg Unger. ‘‘We get no help from admis-
sions, and can’t offer scholarships.”

Junior Midfielder T.J. Finnerty, co-captain of next
year’s team, agreed with Unger. ‘‘We’ll be more com-
petitive as far as play 1n Division III goes,” he said.

powers and hiring an accountant to
disburse student funds if the EC lost
money on student accounts again this
year, according to Student Body Vice

The University is allowing two
years for the money to be raised.

The board received a report on the
Annual Fund from its Planning and
Development committee. “‘We’re up
in every possible category,”’ Wilson
said of the rise in both donations and
donors.

“Alumni are really supporting the
University this year,”’ he said.

In other business, the board ap-
proved promotions, tenure, and
department head appointments
among the faculty.

Mathematics Professor Robert S.
Johnson is the first professor to be
awarded the Cincinnati Professor-

ship, which recognizes an 1802 gift
from the Society of the Cincinnati of
Virginia.

Edgar W. Spencer, professor of
geology, was awarded the Ruth
Parmly Professorship, which recog-
nizes her gifts to the University.

Associate professors promoted to
full professor were Denis J. Brion
and Mark H. Grunewald of the Law
School, Roger B. Jeans Jr. of the
history department, Hampden H.
Smith III of journalism and 0. Ken-
dall White Jr. of sociology.

Assistant professors promoted to
associate professor were H. Laurent
Boetsch of Romance languages, John

H. Knox of the biology department,
Steven H. Hobbs and Brian C. Mur-
chison of the Law School and Richard
F. Grefe of the University Library.

Department head reappointments
were Edgar W. Spencer in geology
and Buford S. Stephenson in German.

Lyn F. Wheeler was appointed
head of the accounting department,
replacing professor Jay D. Cook Jr.,
who has held the position since 1959.

J. Kevin Green of the accounting
department was awarded tenure.

The board also received reports
from the Alumni Interfraternity
Council and the Campus Life Com-
mittee.

Atkins of Alumni Association
named to fraternity deanship

 

By JASON LISI
News Editor

 

Associate Alumni Director Leroy
C. ““Buddy”’ Atkins accepted an offer
Monday to be Associate Dean of
Students Lewis G. John said yester-
day.

In what John called a ‘‘reorganiza-
tion” of the Dean of Students’ office,
Atkins now will be in charge of
fraternity affairs and student ac-
tivities, and have a position that is a
combination of the jobs of Associate
Deans of Students Dan N. Murphy
and Michael A. Cappeto.

Next year, Murphy will be a full-
time associate director of admis-
sions. Cappeto will take a dean of
students’ job with Harvey Mudd Col-
lege in Claremont, Calif.

An associate dean of students in
charge of career placement, part of
Cappeto’s job now, will be named
later, John said.

Atkins was one of 90 candidates

from within and outside Washington
and Lee that were chosen by a com-
mittee of seven members of the Dean
of Students’ office and President
John D. Wilson.

“We determined that he was the
best person for the job — he certainly
has the experience working with all
the constituencies at Washington and
Lee,’’ John said, noting that Atkins
has had contact with faculty, stu-
dents and alumni. ‘His background
here at Washington and Lee and
knowledge of those areas will be a
real asset in this office.”

“T was very pleased that he’s
agreed to serve in this important
position,”’ he said.

John said that the six or seven
finalists for the job met with Inter-
fraternity Council President Chris
Saxman and Student Activities
Board Chairman Michael Guerriero
because the new associate dean of
students will work closely with those
two groups.

He added that the position will in-
clude many aspects of student life,
including being the primary ad-

ministrative contact for the frater-
nities and SAB.

Atkins, a 1968 W&L graduate, said
yesterday he was happy to accept the
position.

‘I’m pleased that I have the oppor-
tunity to do something that is ap-
parently important to a lot of people
and be able to help the school,’’ he
said.

He said that although he has no
definite plans for action, he will be
receptive to the students in the areas
of fraternities and student affairs.

Atkins said that he has ideas for
what aspects of the fraternities need
to be improved.

“I’m very optimistic about the
future of fraternities here and the
ability of the school to have not just a
fraternity system, but if they so
decide, a Greek system that will bea
model for what it ought to be at other
schools,” he said.

“This administration has made a
commitment to see that they are
strong and a permanent part of the

Pate leaving admissions office
for Richmond banking position

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Executive Editor

 

Associate Admissions Director
Van H. Pate will leave Washington
and Lee on June 13 to join the trust
department of Sovran Bank in Rich-
mond.

Pate, who is also an assistant pro-
fessor of Romance languages and a
W&L alumnus, said he is “leaving
simply because I have a super oppor-
tunity.”’

He said the move also “was dic-
tated’’ by the fact that his wife, Anne
W. Pate, needed to begin her
accounting career “‘in a city bigger
than even Lexington or Roanoke.”’
She has accepted a position as
auditor at the Richmond office of the
Arthur Young Co., a “Big Eight”’ ac-
counting firm.

Pate said he will be working in new
business development, a sales posi-
tion. “I’m still going to be dealing
with people,’’ he said

He said he has missed teaching his

ee ee meres se — eee

elementary and intermediate French
classes the last few years, and has
enjoyed his frequent contact with
Student Recruitment Committee
members.

“It’s easy in Admissions to lose
contact with students — that’s one of
the frustrations of this business,’’ he
said.

Pate noted that among faculty
members and administrators,
“everybody is involved in everything
around here — that’s what’s wonder-
ful about this place.”’

After graduating from W&L in
1971, Pate joined the University as
assistant director of admissions. He
became director of student financial
aid in 1973 and rejoined the admis-
sions office in 1979 as associate direc-
tor. He obtained a master’s degree
from Middlebury College the follow-
ing year.

As a French and Spanish major at
W&L, Pate was an officer in the
Sigma Phi Epsilon social fraternity
and was a member of the predeces-
sor group to Southern Comfort.

OPINION
Party’s over?

As the spring term draws to a close, it seems only proper to
take a look back at the year.

At this time last year, I was still celebrating having been
accepted to become a member of W&L’s first coed under-
graduate class. My friends and I were busy collecting posters
to decorate dorm walls. At that time, it seems the most
challenging prospect of college life was finding a way to in-
still some of my personality into four beige walls, a bed, and
a desk.

Arriving in September, I expected and dreaded many
things. The Class of 1989 had been described as being the best
and the brightest to walk the Colonnade in many years.
Would we — indeed, could we — live up to the expectations of
Washington Hall? Could we maintain good grades, extracur-
ricular activities, social lives and our sanity? It seemed to be
a very tall order to fill and one I wasn’t sure I could meet. I
should have had more faith in my classmates. It now appears
that the first coed class has lived up to all of the expectations.

I remember being scared to death on the first day of
classes. After hearing about all the opposition to the move to
coeducation had met, I expected the first day of the fall term
to resemble the busing riots of the sixties, complete with
picket signs and the ROTC in riot gear. Certainly to my sur-
prise and delight, the worst comment I heard, or rather
overheard, was, ‘“‘Hey, how many girls did they let in here
anyway?’’ Most students and faculty accepted the first coed
classes without missing a beat.

It seemed to me that we, being the first coed class, should
try to assimilate, to become part of the student body. Calling
attention to our difference from other classes by asking for or
expecting special favors seemed to promote bitterness and
rivalry between the classes. Yet the fact remains that the
Class of 1989 is different. W&L will never be the same after
we leave, and we should take pride in that fact. It is
necessary to be a part of the student body and still retain a
separate identity. Assimilation should be a goal, but not one
met at all costs.

The Women’s Forum and the Coeducation Committee have
made good progress this year in establishing some programs
and opportunities for women. As more undergrad women
come to W&L, these committees will play an increasingly
more important role on campus. In laying the groundwork
for these programs, the committees met some opposition.
Many students seemed to think that W&L women were get-
ting anything and everything they asked for. Rather, the
committees, it seemed, tried to ensure that the same oppor-
tunities for leadership positions, social clubs, etc. exist for
women at W&L as they exist at other coed universities and
for men at W&L.

However, I think what surprised many students and what
surprised me was the immediacy with which many changes
were made. I suppose I came here ready for a fight, expect-
ing to scrape for every tiny victory for my rights. But it
seems the decision to go coed was no half-hearted decision,
and once the decision had been made, the administration and
entire university have tried to accommodate the new coed
class as much as possible. We have not been punished or
given an endurance test because of our decision to be a part
of W&L’s first coed year; rather we have been welcomed.

Looking back, the problems that confronted the Class of
1989 now seem pretty trivial. Inadequate laundry facilities
for the freshmen were quickly rectified, and the horror
stories of staying up all night waiting for a free washer/dryer
dissipated. Then there was a minor dispute over whether
women from surrounding women’s colleges were tying up the
dorm bathrooms and should something be done about it. But
this problem was solved after the heavy partying of Rush
drew to a close and visitors from other schools no longer
flocked to W&L in such droves. Vandalism in the dorms was
also a problem, but that too seems to have waned, especially
after it was announced that halls would be collectively ~
responsible for the costs of any repairs necessary to the hall
and adjoining stairwells.

Perhaps the most serious problem that faced the Class of
1989 was the potential division of the Class. With such em-
phasis being placed on the women in the first coed class, it
would be very easy and probable that the men of the class of
1989 might feel slighted. One has to remember that the
women in the freshman class came here because it was a
great university — a great coed university. The women didn’t
choose W&L because they would be on center stage, but
rather because it offers the opportunity for a good education.
W&L is coed not just because of the women in the class, but
also because of the men.

The Class of 1989 deserves to congratulate itself. It’s been a
good first year of coeducation and it is largely due to the class
itself. Being the class to ‘‘blaze the trail,’’ it is our respon-
sibility to make the going a little easier for each class that
follows. We also have to stay on our toes. Next year’s
freshman class is being billed as being better and brighter
than ourselves.

Racism, homogeneity: W&L’s Catch 22:

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
Editor

 

Coeducation seems to have gone
pretty well this year. About 100
women showed up to be in this year’s
class, there are another hundred
coming next year, and Washington
and Lee thought up all sorts of things
to make The Transition as easy as
possible for them, like lounges in the
dormitories, a salad bar in the dining
hall, and suggestions that student
government committees have non-
voting women members.

A few years back there was
another big change at W&L. It was
called integration. Unfortunately,
not so many black students felt like
attending an all-white college, but
the few that did were given scholar-
ships, a minority dean and a house to
live in. And still not many came to
W&L. And next year, the freshman
class will boast six black students.
Count ’em. Six.

The obvious conclusion is that
more needs to be done to attract
qualified blacks and other minori-
ties.

What’s the difference between
coeducation and integration? In
coeducation, girls like to hang out
with guys (and vice versa), so lots of
girls apply to formerly all-male
schools. With integration, members
of one race would really rather hang
out with their own kind of people, so
not so many blacks apply to formerly
all-white colleges. That’s just the

way we are as human beings.

Being white, I can’t pretend to
know what it’s like being black at a
mostly white school. I do remember,
though, having a big red pimple on
the end of my nose one day, and
noticing that everyone I talked to
didn’t really look me in the eye or
listen to what I was saying, but kind
of acted like they couldn’t get that
pimple off their minds. I’m guessing
it would be something like that. And I
do know that I would feel very un-
comfortable attending Grambling or
Hampton Institute. That’s why I
didn’t go to those schools.

That point has two parts: One,
black students at W&L probably
don’t have an easy time of it because
they are in such a severe minority;
and two, W&L isn’t going to get more
blacks and minorities until that fact
changes.

And getting more minorities
doesn’t just benefit the blacks.
Remember the coeducation argu-
ment? ‘“‘When we get out into the real
world, we’re going to have to work
with women, so we'd better learn
how to do it now.”’ And, “‘If this is a
liberal education, how are we suppos-
ed to learn about other people if all
we have here are the same kind of
person?”’

Well, the same solid reasoning ap-
plies to blacks. But we still don’t have
integration, and we won't until we
make the percentage of black stu-
dents here near the percentage it is in
the real world.

The difference between coeduca-

tion and integration at W&L is that
the blacks are less inclined to come
here, for obvious and understandable
reasons. So, what W&L needs to do is
try harder to get them.

That’s not to say that scholarships
should be given to unqualified black
students, or that black students
should be given special consideration
in the admissions process. That
would be the lazy man’s way out.

The answer to getting more
minorities is simple: Spend more
money on recruiting them, and make
the atmosphere better for them, by
hiring more black professors, creat-
ing an Afro-American Studies pro-
gram, and soon.

It’s not that the Admissions Office
isn’t doing its job. Admissions
counselor Bob Tomaso says qualified
black students are the hottest com-
modity in the business, and W&L has
to compete for them with schools like
Brown and Williams.

One logical answer is another
recruiter — or two, or three — who
focuses only on minorities. Right now
there are six recruiters in the Admis-
sions Office. This year those six at-
tracted 58 black applicants. That
number could conceivably double if
one or two extra people recruited at
black high schools.

Tomaso said he thinks an extra
recruiter focusing on minorities
would help, but that recruiting isn’t
the only solution. Another problem is
the atmosphere, which scares many
black students away.

Of this year’s 58 black applicants,

33 were accepted and 6 have decided
to enroll. That means 18 percent of
those accepted thought life at W&L
would be bearable enough to come
here. That compares to the 49 per-
cent “yield” for white students. Ob-
viously the black students are stay-
ing away for a reason that doesn’t ap-
ply to white students.

Tomaso read a letter from a highly
qualified black student who was ac-
cepted at W&L but decided to go
elsewhere.

“T’'ve decided to enroll at Brown
University because there was a much
larger minority community there
and there were many support ser-
vices and for minorities. I
disliked the fact that W&L had no
Afro-American courses or black
teachers. Also, the community at
Washington and Lee seemed too
homogeneous and conservative.”

W&L has been hiring women for
open professors’ jobs since last year.
Where are the black professors?

We've got a Jewish studies pro-
gram in place because a Jewish
alumnus funded one. Where’s the
black studies program?

It seems to me that if you have two
new kinds of students you want at
your school, and one of them comes
readily and the other doesn’t, then
you work on the second until you get
the number you want.

This isn’t a poor school. Reducing
its homogeneity by increasing the
number of black students can’t cost a
lot of money and it would make W&L
a better place. Coeducation did.

Ain’t burning all my bridges before | leave

 

By NELSON PATTERSON
Editorial Page Editor

Two months ago, I wrote a rather
indicting piece on congressional
reluctance to back the cause of
Nicaraguan contra rebels. Just after
the piece was published, a certain
journalism professor asked another
editor of The Phi if I were serious in
what I had written. The senior jour-
nalism major replied he thought that,
in part, I spoke with conviction and
that in part, I was poking fun at the
way Pat Buchanan orchestrated the
White House lobbying effort on the
issue.

“That’s too bad,” replied the pro-
fessor. ‘‘I guess he’s learned nothing
in four years.”’

Think again, professor. I have
learned many lessons well at Wash-
ington and Lee. (One of those lessons,
incidentally, was learning never to
waste my time in one of his courses. )

There is some point in everyone’s
senior year when the tendency sud-
denly exists for one to be nostalgic
and maudlin, recounting tales of
freshman hall escapades (like stuff-
ing a neighboring student’s room full
of wadded-up newspaper) like an
alumnus at a 25th reunion. I really
detest that sort of reminiscing, for it
reminds me of people who never
seem to be able to grow up.

Yet, there are a few lessons I have
studied and re-studied during the last
weeks of my undergraduate life that
seem worthy of passing on to others.

Many people will claim I am a
rebellious brat when I write my first

account, but it is a lesson I have had
to learn several times over.

*Don’t believe that everyone at
Washington and Lee believes in the
Honor System, and that includes
(especially) some members of the
faculty and administration. In
writing for the newspaper, I have
been misled and lied to more times
than I wish to recount. The Honor
System, for all the good I believe it to
be and for all the convenience it
presents for the community, is made
a mockery by many people on this
campus. An administrator who lies
about policy reviews and directives
he/she has supposedly ‘‘given’’ often
needs a student or peer to check up
on the truth (or lack thereof) in his
statement. The EC has jokingly
given “honorary honor violations’’ to
many members of the faculty and ad-
ministration whose _ ‘‘selective’’
memories often allow them to forget
certain promises they made or
statements they gave. Like the few
students who ruin the image of the
Honor System for the rest of us, there
are a few bad apples in the faculty
who spoil the whole barrel.

*Believe forever in the idea that
faculty and students and administra-
tion can and should work together.
Some administrators believe stu-
dents are nothing more than bother-
some gnats chafing them at the col-
lar. After all, every decision doesn’t
(and shouldn't) need to be made in a
fraternity circle on the Colonnade.
Yet, smug administrators should
never feel comfortable making a
decision and damning student opi-
nion at the same time. As students,

we shouldn’t be afraid to say when
we think our interests have been
overlooked.

Don’t ever accuse a professor or
administrator of deceiving you or
misspelling a word on a test or any
other breach of normal behavior
unless you have considered the
serious repercussions of your words.
My sophomore year, I took a make-
up test and discovered a word I
believed was misspelled. I told the
professor that, but in the wrong way.
The rest of the term was not a happy
experience, to say the least, and I
have regretted ever since those few
errant words. I lost the chance to
take advantage of the opportunity the
W&L system presents by talking a lit-
tle out of line.

eBeware of the professor who
maintains that he/she is not a
member of the typical Maoist faculty
establishment. Need I say more?
Nearly 80 percent of the faculty, in a
random poll last year, said they
would vote for Mondale and Ferraro.
Higher education, like fresh fly
paper, seems to attract bothersome
pests every once in a while. Partisan-
ship will always enter classroom
discussion, and students merely need
be aware of the political tendencies
of most faculty members. There
should ideally be no fear of letting
partisanship enter classroom debate
where appropriate; iron sharpens
iron.

*Don’t believe coeducation will
promote a genderless society at
W&L anytime soon. For nearly 250
years, W&L existed solely to educate
the gentleman. When coeducation

brought in fresh faces and healthy
competition, some idealistic and
naive apostles believed sexism could
be dealt a final and fatal blow.
Wrong, again. I sincerely hope that
coeducation proceeds smoothly and
W&L women begin to exert some of
the genetically gifted leadership
abilities their mentors in the ad-
ministration believe them to possess.
We could use a few Maggie Thatch-
ers around here, or at least half a
Jeanne Kirkpatrick. And I hope that
the men don’t allow themselves to be
trampled upon anytime soon. I’m
sure they could always start a Men’s
Forum, if their ‘“‘turf’’ becomes
threatened.

I have been accused this year of
running a fascist editorial page,
especially by a certain Woods Creek
paramilitary suite/group/bunch of
knaves. Their criticism, though
usually couched in jest, is perhaps
the harshest I have recieved during
the entire year, for it accuses me of
limiting the exposure of other and
diverse opinions on this page. I hope I
haven’t done that, and if I have, my
regrets do exist.

At the same time, this paper has
never really had a strong central
voice speaking for it. I hope the past
two years have been a good start
toward establishing one, and I am
confident the woman who will suc-
ceed me will continue to ‘‘comfort the
afflicted and afflict the comfor-
table,” as H.L. Mencken used to say.
Sorry to those who saw in my leaving
a chance to breathe again; there is no
rest for the wicked.

The Student Recruitment Commit-
tee, the many well-dressed tour
guides for visitors to the Washington
and Lee campus, is a key part of at-
tracting students here, admission of-
ficials say.

Julia M. Kozak, the admissions
counselor who works most closely
with the committee, said the most
important — and visible — aspect of
the committee is to give tours to pro-
spective students. That, though, is
not its only function.

Besides on-campus tours, Student
Recruitment members also help with
scholarships weeks and sometimes
speak to groups at their high schools.

The committee is composed of
students chosen by the chairman and
his two co-chairmen who are selected
by the admissions staff.

The competition to get on the com-
mittee is fierce. Kozak said there
were approximately 56 members this
year and 760 students applied for the
20 positions being vacated by seniors.

Senior Sandy Whann, this year’s
chairman, said the process is highly
selective.

“We're looking for a represen-
tative group of students’”’ to be in Stu-
dent Recruitment,’’ Whann said.

Kozak also said the chairmen
‘“‘make a conscious effort to try to get
a cross section of the student body,”
including athletes, fraternity and
non-fraternity members and
students from each of the Universi-
ty’s major departments.

“We're looking for someone with
personality, personability, a wide
range of interests and dependabili-
ty,”’ said next year’s chairman, Mac
Gibson.

Whann said the successful can-
didates for Student Recruitment are

John D. Wilson warned the graduates
to protect their diplomas.

He said that W&L is ‘‘one of the few
places on earth where when we speak
of a sheepskin diploma, we mean it,”’
and to audience laughter cut through
the usual commencement platitudes
with this tip: “‘Do leave them in their
tubes until you’re safely under
cover.... Sheepskin, if it gets wet,
dissolves.”’

‘the ones who can adda little more to
the tour than the date the buildings
were built.”’

Last year, Whann said he asked
candidates how they would handle
different situations they might find
themselves in on tours, including
pushy mothers and the prospective
student who doesn’t say a word.

Committee member Michael
Longshore, a sophomore, said one of
the most basic requirements for a
committee member is ‘‘the ability to
talk with all kinds of people.”’

Once on the committee, a member
is expected to work at least one hour
a week, usually giving tours. Whann
said members occasionally have to
give Saturday morning tours.

Gibson said an often-overlooked
responsibility of the committee is
helping with scholarship weeks for
prospective students. He said
members make sure the students get
to classes and become familiar with
the University.

Committee members said the tours
are important because a prospective
student is often heavily impressed by
the student tour guides.

“The lasting impressions [of the
University] are those of the tour
guides,’’ Kozak said.

Gibson said the important parts of
a tour are giving ‘‘a student’s
perspective of W&L”’ and ‘‘a realistic
view of the University.”

“You can make this place as ex-
citing, glorified as you want,”’ as long
as what is said is realisite, Whann
said.

“You’ve got to make a good im-
pression — period,’’ Whann said of
giving tours.

Gibson said a good impression
sometimes is hard to make. He said
he once gave a tour to a prospective
student and his mother, who wanted
to see the dormitories — not an
unusual request. He knocked on a

Stricter rules
face ’90 class

 

By SIMON PEREZ
Staff Reporter

 

Next year’s freshmen will face
fines and possible expulsion from the
dormitories if the new alcohol con-
sumption rules are broken, accord-
ing to Dean of Freshmen H. Robert
Huntley.

A “sliding scale of punishment”
will be applied to freshmen who are
found violating rules, Huntley ex-
plained.

First offenders will be fined $5 and
be referred to Huntley; second of-
fenders will have to pay $15, see
Huntley, and have a letter sent to
their parents; and if a freshman is
caught a third time, a $25 fine will be
imposed, the student will be required
to see Huntley again and temporary
expulsion of the student from the
dorms will be considered,

Huntley said all fine money will go
to a hall activities fund for recrea-
tional activities for the freshmen.

There is a dilemma between the
fact that “dorms cannot provide a
sanctuary” for the freshmen to
drink, and the fact that the dorms are
the homes of the freshmen, Huntley
said.

 

Jeff Mandak, next year’s head
dorm counselor, said the rules will be
more strictly enforced than this year.

Huntley said the freshmen will not
be allowed to drink in ‘‘the dorm
halls, quads, adjacent to dorms, or
anywhere near the dorms where they
can be seen drinking.”’

‘There are essentially no changes
as far as the Virginia State Code is
concerned,’’ Huntley said, but the
reason for the intensified enforce-
ment is to ensure there are no pro-
blems with local police.

“Tf there are, there will be real ar-
rests and real fines,’’ Huntley added.

Mandak said dorm counselors had
some problems enforcing the rules
this year, but predicted that the new
rules will help to ‘‘clarify every-
thing,’’ and make enforcing the rules
easier for the counselors because all
problems will be handled in the same
way.

Huntley agreed that ‘‘uneven ap-
plication” of the rules caused some
difficulties. He said the dorm coun-
selors were stereotyped into “‘law-
and-order types’’ on those halls
where counselors were strict on
drinking and ‘‘good ol’ boy types”’ on
those halls where drinking was allow-
ed.

‘Student Recruitment Committee: W&L’s ‘ambassadors’

 

 

By Steve Sadler/The Ring-tum Phi

Junior Brandt Surgner shows a prospective student around

freshman’s door and was invited in,
but much to his surprise — and the
prospective’s mother — the fresh-
man’s walls were decorated with
photographs and cartoons from
Playboy.

Longshore said he avoids tour
groups through the dorms on

Monday mornings because of the
mess that tends to accompany a
weekend of partying at Washington
and Lee.

Whann said Student Recruitment
members should not be classified
simply as tour guides, but rather as
‘ambassadors of the school.”’

Former student sentenced on cocaine distribution charge

Staff Reports

 

John H. MeLarin, a former Washington and Lee stu-
dent from Richmond, was sentenced to serve 300 hours
of community service last Wednesday for a conviction
ona charge of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.

McLarin was indicted Sept. 4, 1984, by the special
grand jury that was formed earlier that year to in-
vestigate local drug trafficking.

Clerk of Rockbridge Circuit Court D. Bruce Patterson
said yesterday that McLarin originally was in-
dicted on two counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine,
but one of the charges was dropped. McLarin was found
guilty on one of the counts Nov. 20, 1985.

McLarin was sentenced to five years in the state
penitentiary by Circuit Judge George K. Honts III.
Honts suspended the jail sentence and placed McLarin
on five years probation and ordered him to perform 300
hours of community service.

Police report check forgery

A check belonging to sophomore Alex Richmond was
forged at Pres Brown’s Inc. last Saturday, according to
a police report. The check was for the amount of $57.46
and signed Jeff T. Tree

Another forged check belonging to Richmond was
given to the Lexington police on Tuesday, police said
That check, for the amount of $12, was used at Estelle’s
Grill and was signed John L. Tree

The police have no suspects in the case

In other police news:

eSophomore Steve Sadler, from Easton, Md., was
charged with assault and battery and trespassing after
an incident at 2:25 a.m. Sunday at 511 S. Main Street.

Virginia Moran, the owner of the boarding house at
the same address, said in the report that Sadler grabb-
ed her left arm and forced his way by her when she tried
to stop him from going to his friend’s room.

Moran and Sadler declined to speak to a reporter
about the case.

eFreshman Michael Kidd reported that on May 18,
someone entered his unlocked dormitory room and
removed $90 in assorted bills from his wallet. There are
no suspects in the case.

reported that $370 worth of camping equipment was
taken from his 1976 Plymouth while it was parked in the

EC considers new organization

At Monday night’s Executive Committee meeting
freshman Tom Brickel made a proposal to the commit-
tee about the possibility of starting a student-run
organization to buy used books that would be used on
campus at half the original price.

Brickel wanted to get the EC’s response to the idea
because the plan may need money to get started. Most
EC members were receptive to the idea but said there
were still some problems to be worked out.

Helena Roller, manager of the campus bookstore,
said she has nothing against a student-run book-buying
organization but she said she didn’t think the students
realized all the obstacles they would run into such as
professors changing their minds about what books will
be used next year and finding a place to store the books.

Roller also said that the W&L Bookstore already pays
50 percent of the original price of books if they have a
guarantee that the book will be used next year. Lower
rates are paid for books that will be used on other cam-
puses or not used at all.

IFC donates $470 to MS

The Interfraternity Council and the 17 social frater-
nities raised more than $470 for the Multiple Sclerosis

May 3 lacrosse game against Loyola College

The $25 entry fees paid by the fraternities to be in the
contest plus the $36.38 in donations collected at halftime
by the Delta Tau Delta fraternity made up the $471.38
given to the Blue Ridge Chapter of the Multiple
Sclerosis Foundation

Freshmen cars vandalized

Vandals attempted to steal a number of items of
stereo equipment from five cars in the freshman park
ing lot last night, according to University Proctor

Charles F. ‘“‘Murph’’ Murray

‘We got it all back,” Murray said of the items.

Two Washington and Lee security guards entered the '
tower lot late last night and found two speakers anu ait

equalizer lying on the ground by a car.

Upon investigating, they found that a small front win-
dow had been broken to gain entry into the vehicle.

The men then investigated the upper lot and found
more items on the ground.

Among the items removed from the vehicles were a
car stereo and two separate speaker systems.

The vandals attempted to remove a stereo from one
car, and left it hanging from the dash, said Murray.

Rush calendar announced

Rush, which will last approximately two weeks next
fall, begins with open houses on Sunday, Sept. 21 and
Monday, Sept. 22. After a short period of ‘‘no contact’’
between houses and rushees, rush dates will be held
Sept. 24, 26, Oct. 1 and 3. Bids can be given out by houses
at the fifth and sixth rush dates, Oct. 1, and accepted
after the eight rush date, Oct.3.

Fraternities are allowed to have band parties on two
consecutive Saturdays, Sept. 20 and 27. No bands are
permitted Oct. 4, the night of ‘‘optional’’ rush dates and
nine and 10. Wednesday night parties are prohibited
throughout the official rush period

The IFC will make its first rush presentation to
freshmen Sept. 11 as part of orientation week. The sec-
ond talk will be made Sept. 19, two days prior to rush
registration.

Class of ’86
to graduate

Thursday

 

By CHARLES GAY
Staff Reporter

 

Members of the Class of 1986 will
bring their years at Washington and
Lee to an end with the 201st under-
graduate commencement exercises
next week.

Exercises will begin with the bac-
calaureate service in Evans Dining
Hall on Wednesday at 11 a.m.

The service will feature the Rev.
Christoph Keller Jr., a W&L trustee
and Bishop Emeritus of the
Episcopal diocese of Arkansas.

Later that day, the University
faculty will host a reception and
dance for the graduates and their
families in Evans Dining Hall.

Thursday, commencement ac-
tivities begin at 9 a.m. with the Army
ROTC’s commissioning ceremony in
Lee Chapel. Commander of the U.S.
Army Cadet Command Major Gen.
Robert Wagner will speak at the
ceremony.

At 11 a.m. on the lawn between Lee
House and Lee Chapel, diplomas will
be presented to the graduating
students in the College of Arts and
Sciences and the School of Com-
merce, Economics and Politics.

The tradition of the president of the
student body delivering remarks
rather than the valedictorian began
several years ago.

“The change was made because
the student body resident was decid-
ed to be more appropriate as a
representative of his class,’’ said
Dean of Students Lewis G. John.
“Often, the valedictorian didn’t know
his fellow students well enough to
represent them.”’

According to University Registrar
D. Scott Dittman, 281 degrees will be
awarded.

Four honorary degrees will be
awarded by the University at the
ceremony.

Former Virginia Governor Charles
S. Robb and his wife, Lynda J. Robb,
founder of the Virginia Women’s
Cultural History Project, will receive
a degree.

Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein, a reci-
pient of the 1985 Nobel Prize in
medicine and a 1962 W&L graduate,
and William B. Spong Jr., professor
of law and a former U.S. senator, will
also receive degrees.

From left to right, award winners Hayne, Pressler, Lindeman, Herrick and Pate

Three seniors, a departing ad-
ministrator and a community leader
received Ring-tum Phi awards at last
night’s Senior Night, a Lee Chapel
program sponsored by the Alumni
Association.

Recipients of the awards were:

eJames L. ‘Jaimie’ Hayne Jr., a
history major from San Antonio, Tex-
as, the outgoing Interfraternity
Council president and former presi-
dent of the Kappa Alpha Order social
fraternity.

The Phi noted that as IFC presi-
dent, Hayne ‘‘worked diligently to
improve the image of fraternities
with [University] administrators
and with local residents and of-
ficials.”’

Hayne is a member of Kathekon,
the student-alumni association, and
is a two-year member of the Student
Recruitment Committee.

eDianne W. Herrick, project coor-
dinator for the year-old Lexington
Downtown Development Association.

A six-year resident of Lexington,
Herrick also has chaired the Chris-
tian Education Committee at Lex-
ington Presbyterian Church, where
she is an elder and taught a first-and

second-grade Sunday school class.
The local United Way drive exceed-
ed its fundraising goal while she was
its executive director, and she was an
organizer of the recent move of the
Rockbridge Regional Library to a
new location. She is the wife of Bruce
H. Herrick, chairman of Washington
and Lee’s economics department.
eKenneth L. Lindeman, a physics
and engineering major from Atlanta.
Lindeman was a sophomore Ex-
ecutive Committee representative
and has served on the Student
Recruitment Committee, is a dor-
mitory counselor and is a member of
the Glee Club, Southern Comfort and
the Phi Delta Theta social fraternity.

A member of Phi Beta Kappa and
Phi Eta Sigma, the freshman honor
society, Lindeman also has been on
the dean’s list and honor roll. He has
attained the ROTC rank of Cadet Bat-
talion Command Sergeant Major,
and Military Science Professor Luke
B. Ferguson refers to him as ‘the
man whoran the program.”

Van H. Pate, an associate director
of admissions and assistant professor
of Romance languages, who is leav-
ing W&L next month.

In presenting the award, The Phi

Five receive Phi awards

noted that Pate’s contributions were
especially valuable because he is
among the few administrators who
are W&L alumni. Pate, a 1971
graduate who majored in French and
Spanish, joined the University ad-
ministration that year as assistant
director of admissions. In 1973, he
became director of student financial
aid, and in 1979 was named associate
director of admissions. During that
time, he also taught a number of

French classes.

Townes G. Pressler, an economics
major from Houston, class president
for all four years.

Pressler headed the Student Con-
trol Committee this year, is a
member of the Student Recruitment
Committee and Kappa Alpha, and is
a charter member of Kathekon. He
conceived and is promoting the Tom
Fellin Memorial Scholarship, a five-
year fundraising project the class of
1986 is beginning this spring.

He is a four-year track and field
letterman, and for the last three
years has placed in the top four in the
high jump at the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Outdoor Track
and Field Championships.

Futch tells seniors to avoid “goody-goodies’

History Professor Jefferson Davis
Futch III warned the soon-to-be-
graduated senior class last night to
ignore the utopian-seeking ‘“goody-

back the ideals of the 1960s, and to
keep their feet firmly planted in
reality and in tradition.

“The age of lunacy is gone,’’ Futch
said. ‘‘The age of reason is back.”’

Futch was the keynote speaker for

“It’s going to take some hard work,
creative thinking and a lot of
cooperation among different consti-
tuencies — the University ad-
ministration, the faculty, the student
body, the Interfraternity Council and
the alumni — in order to put the
fraternities back in the position
where they're a strong body of viable
and attractive alternatives for a
place to live, a place to eat, and a
place to provide more than just a
social outlet,”’ he said.

“IT think most, if not all, of the
fraternities probably provide a lot

realize progress in that direction,”’
he said.

Atkins said that he will need some
time to investigate the student ac-
tivities on campus before he can
make any plans for action.

‘T have the sense that there’s lots
of things going on here and students
have a tremendous menu to choose
from on a daily basis of things
that they can do for cultural and in-
tellectual and social enrichment, but
I don’t know how much people are

Fake IDs will
concern EC

 

By DANIEL BUNCH
Staff Reporter

The use of fake identification cards
will be a prime concern of next year’s
Executive Committee, several of its
members say.

Shayam Menon, president-elect of
the student body, said, ‘It will come
up and it will be addressed.’’ He said
a policy regarding the use of IDs will
be ‘‘made clear’’ by freshman orien-
tation.

Menon declined to say whether he
considered the use of fake IDs an
honor violation but he said ‘‘each
case will be addressed on its own
merits.”

Sophomore _ representatives-elect
Chris deMovellan and Matt Bryant
both agreed that fake IDs will be an
issue next year.

Bryant said: *‘l detinitely wouldn't
advise fake IDs. I think it’s dishonor-
able and I think it’s lying.’’ He added
that he has given the issue a lot of
thought and he feels that students
have an obligation to represent them-
selves truthfully.

Senior representative-elect An-
drew Caruthers and vice president-
elect Brandt Surgner both said they
thought the EC will have to deal with
the issue next year but they declined
to give their own opinions about fake
ID use.

Another issue the EC will be deal-
ing with next year is the distribution
of the budget. A possible change may
be in the use of student funds for
social events.

‘‘T think we should work on not sup-
plying money for social functions,”
Bryant said. Menon and Surgner
agreed that funds for social events
need to be cut back.

Freshman involvement
is key to fall orientation

 

By MARGUERITE AYERS
Staff Reporter

 

Intellectual, naive, idealistic, and
still possessing all their brain cells,
the class of 1990 will face the realities
of Washington and Lee orientation
Sept. 7 through Sept. 13.

Dean of Freshmen H. Robert
Huntley said the emphasis in next
year’s orientation will be on using
W&L students to familiarize the
freshmen with the school to give
them a better feel for the at-
mosphere.

He said the new students will
become better acclimated to W&L
due to the increased involvement of
upperclassmen.

A tradition that creates the at-
mosphere at this university, the
Honor System, is a high priority on
the orientation schedule for Huntley.
Because of feedback from this year’s
freshmen, the focus will be upon pro-
viding a more comprehensive in-
troduction to its implications and im-
portance.

Shayam Menon, next year’s Ex-
ecutive Committee president, said
“students not committed to honor-
able conduct don’t belong here.”’

“We aren’t out to scare the
freshmen, but we want them to
understand what a person will face if
he acts dishonorably,’’ he said.

Menon said he wants the freshmen
to be better informed of the serious-
ness of the system, and that he would
stress the importance of a strong
understanding of the White Book.

Chris John, senior co-captain
and Mr. Defense for the Washing-
ton and Lee lacrosse team, was

rewarded for his efforts this
season by being selected to repre-
sent the Generals in the 1986

North-South All-Star Game to be
played at Johns Hopkins on June
14,

John has been the team’s defen-
sive leader in 1986, scooping up a
team-leading 80 ground balls in
the Generals’ 5-8 campaign. He is
regularly assigned to the oppo-
nent’s strongest offensive
weapon

“Chris has had a great year,”
head coach Dennis Daly said.
“‘He’s been more consistent this
year. He contributes in every way
as a defenseman.”

John was named the team’s
Defensive Player-of-the-Game in
the Generals’ losses to Virginia,
Towson State and Cornell.

Daly, who will be coacning the
South squad this yearsaid year,
said the selection prooess i in-
volves the head and assistant
lacrosse coaches throughout the
nation. Only seniors are eligible
and there is a restriction that only
two players from the same team
can be represented at the game.

John said it was ‘‘an honor to be
selected’’ and to be able to play

In addition to John, senior
Caulley Deringer, the team’s
leading assist man and second-
leading total scorer, was selected
as an alternate for the game.

Daly said that he would hold two
practices a day on the Thursday
and Friday preceding the Satur-
day game.

Reactions

 

Continued from Page |

“There’s excitement, and the chance
of a tournament bid in Division III
while in Division I it was just getting
further and further away.’

* Senior Defenseman Chris John
said, “I’m very excited about it, this
will provide a much needed lift for
this team.”

Sophmore Midfielder Robbie Stan-
‘on praised the move saying, ‘‘I think
t’s great. It will give a lot of guys a
shance to have a winning season.”’
3ut he also questioned its timing, ad-
ling that he thought ‘‘it was a year
00 late.”’

But it’s not only athletes who are
leased with the decision, the
students also seem to be happy.

Junior Peter Van Son said, ‘‘I think
t’S a good idea. It’s not fair to com-
yete [in Division I], because it’s get-
ing to be like football in that if you
lon’t give scholarships you can’t
‘ompete with those who do.”’

Sophmore E. G. Allen said, ‘‘I’d like
pe the team have a chance to play

r the national title. I think it’s im-
vrtant to the fans and to the
ayers.”

“T think we’re recruiting Division
III players,’ said Sophmore Chase
Faust. ‘‘We can’t play Division I with
Divison III players

Junior Chip Davis agreed, ‘“‘We’re
getting outplayed by Division 1
teams.”

Junior John Koedel also feels the
change will be beneficial to the team.
“T think it would bring us to a level of
competition more consistent with our
talent,”’ he said.

Yet not everyone was entirely en-
thusiastic about the change.

Freshman Attackman John Ware,
while supporting the move, added
that he was ‘“‘a little disappointed
because I came here to play Division
Le

Freshman Midfielder Neill
Redfern expressed similar senti-
ments. ‘‘Personally,’’ he said, ‘‘I’d
rather play Division I.’’ But Redfern
added, ‘‘I think the program has to do
that [change Divisions].”’

Redfern was not the only player to
express that feeling of inevitability.

Senior Defenseman Pete Braden
said the change was “‘unfortunate but
necessary.”

There were also those who were
completely oppossed to the move.

Freshman Rhona Hughes thinks
that the team should stay in Division
I. “Division I is a better league,”’ she
said. ‘‘I would rather be in the middle

of a better league that be at the top of
a minor league.”’

Freshman Chris Willard also
disagreed with the decision saying,
“T think that because the team was
Division I, it created more en-
thusiasm for the sport.’’ He con-
tinued, ‘“‘We played the U.Va.’s, the
Dukes, the Carolinas, it put the
school on the map.”

Beyond the students and the
athletes, there is another group of
people whom this decision affects,
the future athletes and students, next
year’s lacrosse recruits.

Most of them expressed disappoint-
ment at not being able to play Divi-
sion I lacrosse, but optimism for the
future.

Julian Gillespie, a high school
North-South selection at goalie, said,
“My immediate reaction was, well
not betrayal, but disappointment. I
was really looking forward to playing
Division I.”

The goalie from Landon School
said, however, that he thought about
the decision a lot since head coach
Dennis Daly informed him of the
decision Tuesday night by phone. He
said he realized that ““‘W&L was not
the team it was in the 70s. It just
doesn’t belong in Division I.”’

More than the decision, he said, ‘I
wanted to go to W&L for what it was,
not just for its lacrosse program.”

from St. Paul’s, agreed, ‘‘I chose
W&L first for what it had to offer
academically, and then because of
lacrosse.”

He said the decision surprised him,
but that it was in the best interest of
the school. He also said he was ex-
cited about the possibility that. with
W&L as a Division III lacrosse team,
he might “‘even be able to contribute
a little bit more.”’

Chris Giblin, a midfielder from
Episcopal High School, shared
Wilkerson’s excitement. ‘‘I think it’s
a great thing,” he said. “‘I’d rather be
playing for the championship in Divi-
sion III, than play Division I and be
struggling like they have been.”’

The three recruits agreed W&L
would have a good chance at making
the Division III tournament and that
being in Division III would be a more
competitive atmosphere. Gillespie
expressed the enthusiasm for Divi-
sion III success: ‘‘When you’re at the
top in Division III, you can say you’re
as good as anybody.”’

It was this lure of competitiveness
and positive reinforcement that was
attractive to most in favor of the de-
cision. But despite all the talk,
despite all the reasons given for the
change, it may have been outgoing
captain John who managed to hit
closest to home when he said, “‘It’s an
excellent chance to play in the tour-
nament, something which I was.
unable to do.”

Daly: Division change
‘proper, consistent’
with W&L philosophy

 

By DAVID EMRICH
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Maybe, if you’re lucky, you haven’t
had the opportunity to discuss the
decision to change Washington and
Lee lacrosse from Division I to Divi-
sion III.

However, if you have, you’ve most
likely been assaulted by several opi-
nions, and few of those were all that
close to the situation.

Head lacrosse coach, Dennis Daly,
was one of the central players in the
decision. What does the man most
directly affected by the move think?

“T’m glad the athletic department
has decided to treat sports in a con-
sistent fashion,’’ Daly said.

The third-year head coach said
that he had recommended a year ago
that the University ‘‘commit to either
Division I or Division III.”

“T said it was important for the
school to decide,’’ continued Daly.
“If we were to stay as we were, we
should be Division III; if we wanted
to stay Division I, we should treat it
[the lacrosse program] in the same
way as other schools.”’

Daly said the University’s decision
in 1971 to affiliate the lacrosse pro-
gram with Division I but operate
under the no-scholarship constraints
of Division III would not be made in
the same way today.

“It would not be made now due to
the changed nature of the game,”

Daly said.

Indeed, the game has changed
since 1971.

When the athletic department

made the decision to play Division I

lacrosse, very tew schoois otfered
scholarships in the sport. Today,
there are over 20.

Between 1970 and 1980, the
Generals had 10 players named First
Team All-Americans; seven of those
players were honored in more than
one season. No W&L player has
reached that level of recognition
since 1980.

“‘We’re just not getting that type of
player anymore,’ Daly said.

How will the change affect the type
of player who will-decide to come to
W&L?

The new recruits, many of whom
Daly contacted Tuesday night, are
generally enthusiastic about the
change, according to Daly.

“‘T’ve always sold the school first,”’
Daly explained. ‘I talked about a
small college with a great lacrosse
program.”

Now that the decision has been
made, what can we expect from next
year’s team?

“It’s very important that we are
successful and success means wins,”’
Daly said. ‘‘Not necessarily a na-
tional championship, but to get to the
tournament and do well, that’s im-
portant.”’

“Winning is very valuable,” Daly
elaborated. ‘It’s a kind of positive
reinforcement. That’s something we
didn’t have here the past four years.”’

Daly said the team should be able
to do well when the pressure mounts
next year, that the confidence level
will be greater simply by virtue of be-
ing in Division III.

“T think that now we’re in the pro-
per classification for the institutional
philosophy,”’ Daly said.

The soccer team has been a part of the success of women’s sports at W&L

 

By Perry S. Hayes/The Ring-tum Phi

A General success

Women’s athletics prospers through enthusiasm

 

By CHARLES GAY
Staff Reporter

 

Coeducation seemingly has touched every
aspect of Washington and Lee this year, and no-
where is that effect in greater evidence than in the
athletic department. The department has embark-
ed on a promising women’s program, which in-
cluded three full-fledged teams and a couple of
other athletic outlets for women that promise con-
tinued participation for the future.

While the numbers have been great — nearly 50
percent of the first group of women participated in
W&L athletics in some form — the department’s
greatest victory in its successful development of
women’s sports may have been in a mid-year vic-
tory over a National Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion eligibility requirement.

To receive NCAA certification as a viable Divi-
sion II] program, an institution must field teams
in four women’s sports with one at least one team
coming from each season, according to NCAA
membership coordinator Shirley Whittaker. Whit-
taker said, however, that the four-sport stipulation
was eased when the NCAA granted W&L a waiver
because of an insufficient enrollment.

Whittaker explained that W&L was given a two-
year grace period in which it could field only three
women’s teams and still be certified. The NCAA
would review the W&L situation after two years,
according to Whittaker.

The waiver was a long time coming due to a lack
of understanding, explained Assistant Athletic
Director Cinda L. Rankin.

‘We just couldn’t get it through their heads that

we only had a hundred girls, at first,’ Rankin
said.

The waiver and grace period questions may
become moot by next season, when W&L will field
teams in cross country (fall), swimming. (winter),
tennis (spring) and soccer (spring) in 1986-87. The
women’s soccer team will move to varsity status
next year after being a developmental varsity pro-
gram this year.

Rankin well expressed the enthusiasm held by
the athathletic department: ‘‘We’re really excited
about the program,” she said. “The won-lost
record is not the most critical factor at this point. I
expect better caliber of play next season.”

Indeed, steps have already been taken in an ef-
fort to improve things for next year’s women’s
teams. Rankin pointed specifically to the area of
recruiting activities performed by herself and
Athletic Director William D. McHenry. Based on
these efforts, Rankin confidently asserted, ‘All
{women’s] teams will show improvement within
three years.”

But success has come already in Year 1. Fresh-
man Carolyn Arbogast was a district qualifier in
cross country and classmate Elizabeth Miles was
an honorable mention All-American in two swim-
ming events.

But all the women have been very much behind
the development of the program. Forty-eight per-
cent of all W&L women were involved in sports in
some form (including those managing men’s
teams). Fifty individuals in all participated in
some way in the first year of women’s athletics at
W&L and 10 individuals took part in two or more
sports.

The birth of the women’s soccer team is a
testimony to the growing enthusiasm of the W&L
women for their sports program. Put together
solely by the women who wanted to play, the team
shocked the department with its initiative.

Rankin commented, ‘‘I was pleased and surpris-
ed that it was the students who got behind and
organized the team.”

The girls appear to be satisfied with the way the
program went this year, particularly in relation to
their male counterparts. Freshman tennis player
Benny Savage stated, ‘‘We had a lot of respect for
the guys, and the team realized it would take a
while to reach their level.”’

Savage, an Old Dominion Athletic Conference
consolation finalist, noted that despite its record,
“the [women’s] team played competitively this
year. Next year’s matches should be closer.”’

Savage gave much of the credit to head coach
Bill Washburn and assistant coach Rankin. ‘“‘They
worked us hard and they knew their stuff,
especially Coach Washburn.” Rankin was praised
“for getting us into good shape play.’’ Freshman
Nancy Whalen, a swimmer, said it was difficult at
first trying to work with the men athletes. ‘‘The
guys were probably afraid we’d get too much at-
tention,’ she said. But Whalen dispelled that
thought by saying, ‘‘We were treated the same as
the guys and equally with each other.”

From all accounts, the women’s athletic pro-
gram has started on the right foot. And while
everyone connected with the new teams admits
that it will take time, things appear to be looking
up for the Lady.... er, uh women’s teams.

Wheeler has ‘frustrating’ week at golf nationals

 

 

By MIKE SHADY
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

 

GREG WHEELER

 

When Washington and Lee’s head
golf coach Buck Leslie set priorities
for his charges way back in those
wintry months of January and
February, he said the ‘‘ultimate
goai”’ was to be invited to play in the
NCAA Division III golf champion-
ships. Last week, one W&L golfer
— senior captain Greg Wheeler
— reached that goal by participating
in the national tournament held in
Exeter, Pa.

Although Wheeler carded a four-
day total of 332, some 40 strokes off
the pace, the captain felt that his per-

“It wasn’t a very long golf course and
my game kind of left me,” said
Wheeler, who returned to Lexington
over the weekend. ‘I would have lik-
ed to play better. There were a lot of

The captain and most valuable
golfer award-winner for the past two
years, Wheeler earned his right to
compete at the national champion-
ships with consistent play throughout

“Although I never had any spec-
tacular rounds, I played consistent-
“Tt [being

selected] was definitely in the back
of my mind, but I was still somewhat
surprised.”’

Leslie described Wheeler’s final
round of golf as ‘‘frustrating,’’ but he
said he reminded the senior that
“you don’t always have your best
stuff every day.”’

“Greg was our fifth player [in
W&L history] to be selected,’’ Leslie
said, ‘‘and I told him that it’s an
honor just to get to go in the first
place.”

Wheeler was also honored by being
selected to play in the East-West
match, a preliminary event that not
all the individual competitors were
asked to play in.

“T’m glad I made it,’ Wheeler
said. ‘“‘It was a good experience for
me. The important thing is that my
teammates realize that they too can
make it — that it’s a realistic goal.”

By Mike
Stachura
: There have been some things we

wished we hadn’t seen on our long journey, but we have overcome
them not too much the worse for wear. Like the football team’s in-
auspicious start and its eventual rise to great achievement, more often
than not, the cream rose to the top, and that is much more reason to be
thankful than can be expected, in this day when there are still some
athletes who aren’t sure about verb tense making more money than
the entire Class of 1986 will make its first year out in the real world.

Yes, there have been forgettable moments. Less than honorable
athletes has been a big theme. What does it mean? There are no more
heroes anymore, or is it that there never really were any and we're
just finding that out now. I’d like to think there are heroes and under-
stand and accept the responsibility that goes along with being a cross
between a matinee idol and somebody’s father. Maybe if we started
treating them more like fathers and less like matinee idols they might
turn out better. I know my father never needed cocaine to help him
deal with the pressure of being my hero.

Coaches have been a biggie, too — high school, college and pro. I
wonder if coaches will start getting the benefit of the doubt again
sometime. Does winning have to mean everything? It certainly means
a great deal to colleges and professionals, where W’s mean $$, and $$
means everything.

But, who determined that equation? Does someone coach because
he likes to win? Everybody likes to win and winning is fun (Hell, it’s a
pretty large part of why we’re playing Division III — not so much that
we will win, but that we will have the chance to win), but it isn’t
everything (hokum alert). Is someone all of a sudden a good coach
because his teams win? No, what makes a good coach is the afternoon
chats with a player or the morning visit from a former player who
wants to talk about the old days or the evening phone call to a recruit
who has all the questions but doesn’t get the hard sell.

Those kinds of things don’t get talked about enough anymore. Is it
because they don’t mean much anymore? | hope not. Perhaps, it is
because those things don’t mean much and winning does that our
athletes turn to drugs for support rather than a coach.

I was going to talk about what a successful year W&L has had, what
with the achievements of the women’s sports, of Kevin Weaver and the
football team, of the basketball team, of the wrestlers, of the swim-
mers, of the indoor track team and of the men’s tennis team. But I
realized how hypocritical that sounded. Success is not supposed to be
measured by the number of all-conference performers or All-
Americans you produce. We are proud of W&L athletics most of the
time. (Granted, there are times when we are not so proud of W&L
athletes; there were time this year. To ignore these times would be fol-
ly.) We are proud of W&L athletics because more often than not it br-
ings us people like Andy Haring or Chris Bleggi or Frank Eppes or
Carlton Peebles or Newton Kendrick or Chris John or Jeff Dixon or
Brian Hanson or John DiDuro or Tim Valliere. If you don’t know all of
these people, trust me, they are the kind of people the person who said
“Participation in athletics builds character” had in mind.

In the great scheme of things, then, the record of the Washington
and Lee water polo team in 1985 doesn’t amount to all that much. In-
deed, the record of the Chicago Bears in 1985 won’t amount to all that
much either, except for an occasional outburst in a bar 20 years from
now. But then, that’s what bars and records are for. What is important
is that we take more from the season, more than its numbers, that the
Sunday afternoon Richmond game was a great thing to be a part of,
never mind that we lost. One wonders if the Bears take more than the
record and the dollars from 1985.

If we can learn to look beyond the obvious, to find the things that are
important when you scrape away all those others that everybody else
says are important, then I think we will be content, and we may be
able to make a difference, even if the only person to whom we make a
difference is someone who wants to play catch with us.....

Old textbooks line p

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

If you are like me, the end of the
year is almost always synonymous
with a dwindling bank account. To be
sure, spring term seems to mean
pretty weather, a light workload, and
Saltines and water for supper.

All is not lost, however. since the
end of the year also means it is time
to sell those textbooks. Indeed, what
on earth is one to do with a $28
Calculus book once the year is over?
Fine summer reading, n est-ce pas?

Wallace book buyers. a Lexington,
Ky., firm, has been in the W&L
Bookstore buying used textbooks
since Wednesday afternoon. The
company sends its buyers to univer-
sities and colleges around the coun-
try, buying old textbooks by the
truckload to resell.

Helena ‘“‘Tidge’’ W. Roller.
manager of the University Book-
store, said Wednesday that the com-
pany buys back those books it thinks
will sell later on. The price it sets for
a book is determined by supply and
demand. The buyers speculate what
kind of demand a certain book might
attract and price it accordingly.

The company has a record contain-
ing thousands of titles. each with a
given price. It doesn't buy all books.
of course. Frequently. a book will
have a second edition printed up.
making all first editions obsolete. In
addition, occasionally the company
itself will simply be overstocked on a
certain book.

“We keep what we can.” Roller
said,

She said she talked to as many pro-
fessors as possible to determine
which books could be resold next
year. Then she gave this list to

Wallace's buyers so they could buy
the needed titles

“We use their money, and that is
quite nice. That means we don't have
to go to the University for the money
up front.’ Roller said. ‘Also, we use
their expertise. They know about sec-
ond editions and so forth.”

Norman Lepchitz. a buyer for
Wallace. said that in general the
older the book, the lower the fetching
price. There is more risk of the
book's being updated. which would
result in a warehouse full of obsolete
titles.

Mass market trade paperbacks —
novels and the like — usually resell
for 10 cents on the dollar. Prices for
textbooks vary. depending on the
book's speculated demand.

Roller said she had heard of
student-run co-ops in other univer-
sities in which students themselves
by the used textbooks and resell them
on their own.

“I would be very wary of taking on
an undertaking like that. however.”
she said.

According to Roller, it is important
to know which textbooks will be used
the following year. Also. since it is
improbable that a student-run organ-
ization such as this will be able to
come up with the initial capital need-
ed to buy the books, careful records
must be kept. The seller would have
to be paid the following year when
the book is resold.

Sophomore Elizabeth Smith felt

she should have been paid more
money for her books.

“I paid $42 for a Biology book and
got $10 for it. If you need cash it’s a
good deal, but I expected a whole lot
more money than I got."’ said Smith.

“It could have been better, it could
have been worse,"’ said sophomore
Steve Sears.

Freshman Chris Casey, however,
left the bookstore saying, ‘That was
a quick $38.50!"’

“I didn't pay for the book. It’s just
cash out of the pocket. I know people

who are charging books right now
just to sell them back. It’s quick
cash,”’ Casey said.

“IT would think the honor system
would apply there,’’ said Roller.

War becomes a sport in ‘Rollerball’

“They are dealing in sublimation,
bringing war from a macrocosmic to
a microcosmic scale,’ said Craig
McCaughrin, associate professor of
politics. As organizer of the Politics
FilmFest, he showed the movie last
night and will show it again tonight.

McCaughrin posed questions to the
audience before the movie began
about the ethical nature of a system
that performs under what he called
“scapegoat ethics,’’ placing the
responsibility of the community on
the shoulders of only a few (or a
single person). In the case of ‘‘Roller-
ball,’’ that person, of course, is Caan.

Though Jonathan E is revered the
world over for his skill, he is

somewhat of a threat to the corpora-
tion responsible for rollerball. He is
pressured to retire, but when he
refuses, the corporate executives, led
masterfully by a menacing John
Houseman, decide something must
be done to stop him.

Through it all, Jonathan wants to
find out why he is being pressured out
of the game he loves. At every turn
he is thwarted, for no man can do
solely what he wishes, only what the
corporation allows him to do.

Caan is superb as the introspec-
tive, intense, competitive Jonathan.
He is quick with a put down and slow
to act against his better judgment.
Nowhere is his futility more ap-
parent, however, than when the cor-

poration allows his wife to come visit
him and then she, under orders from
the corporation, asks him to retire. It
is at that point that he realizes any
hope of getting what he really wants
is gone.

Throughout there is a sense of a
foreboding, ominous cloud hanging
over Jonathan’s head. Big Brother
has taken a new dimension in
‘Rollerball,’ giving people what
they think they want to sublimate
their knowing what they really want
and need.

‘Rollerball’ will be shown tonight
at 7 p.m. in Commerce School Room
327. Its strong messages and jolting
action make it well worth a look.

Joe Jackson’s ‘“‘Big World’”’

It has been said (I am not sure by
whom) that music is the best part of
driving. That is probably true. Music
is also the best part of summer (1
said that). And this summer, there is
going to be quite a lot of good music
to listen to. One simply has to know
where to look.

Four new records, in particular,
stand a very good chance of pro-
viding a soundtrack for my own sum-
mer.

First on the agenda-is the new one
from the Mole of Rock and Roll, Joe
Jackson. A three-sided, live 2-track
digital recording, ‘Big World,”
might prove to be Jackson’s most
consistent work since his landmark
“Night and Day’” LP. Using a tradi-
tional three-piece rock and roll outfit,
the new record is not necessarily a
return to Jackson’s rock and roll
past, but it is a successful return to
pop.

Side one is a snappy collection of
pop styles, ranging from the funky
politics of ‘Right and Wrong”’ to the
Eastern-influenced feel of the title
track. Side two contains four slower,
introspective tracks and contains
the albums showstopper, ‘“‘Forty
Years.” Side three comes out rocking
with the most bracing music Jackson
has recorded since his fiery debut,
“Look Sharp!’’ ‘Survival’ is the
highlight.

All in all, the album is a triumph.
Its innovative recording technique
(there is an audience, although the
listener never hears it) gives
Jackson’s hot band enough fire to
push these songs to exciting heights.
In a world of beat boxes and syn-
thesizers, ‘Big World” is probably

 

the most vibrant and human record in
the stores. Buy the compact disc for
maximum results.

The Style Council's new live
release, ‘‘Home and Abroad,” is not
as successful as ‘‘Big World’’ simply
because it takes no chances. None the
less, the album contains fine, polish-
ed performances of Council
favorites, highlighted by a terrific
new track, the Marvin Gaye influenc-
ed ‘(When You) Call Me.” Paul
Weller, of course, is in fine voice
throughout and the band is tight as
all get out. It is a terrific introduction
toa much-underrated band.

The Church, an Australian pop out-
fit, has unfairly been lumped with the
new post-psychedelia movement.
This is unfair as the Church has been
playing lush, atmospheric pop for
years. Their new one, ‘“‘Heyday,”’ is
their best yet and it should go a long
way in setting the Church apart from
the rest of the psychedelic herd.

Beautifully produced by Peter
Walsh, the record’s 10 tunes do not
contain a misplaced note. ‘‘Tantaliz-
ed’’ comes roaring, ‘‘Tristesse”’
soars, and “‘Happy Hunting Ground”
pulsates with understated power.
This record should prove to be one of
the year’s best releases.

And lastly, Husker Du’s new
Warner Bros. debut shows that the
major leagues will not affect this
band’s wonderful fury. The opening
track, ‘‘Crystal,’’ proves this quite
nicely. Bob Mould comes out scream-
ing while the rest of the Huskers play
furiously behind him on perhaps the
most bracing’ three-and-ahalf
minutes Husker Du has yet put on
vinyl.

The record contains some slower,
quieter numbers, but no power is
sacrificed. “‘Too Far Down,”’ for in-
stance, is a powerful acoustic ballad
sung by a man on the edge of suicide.
Other tracks, such as ‘‘Dead Set On
Destruction” and ‘Eiffel Tower
High,”’ feature Husker Du at their
best: loud, fast, and chock full o’
hooks.

This is just the beginning, of
course. This summer promises new
releases from the Smiths, the Meat
Puppets and the Suburbs, Also, check
out the new Let’s Active and Green
on Red releases. In other words, hap-
py listening. It looks like it might be a
good summer.
