Junior Shayam Menon was elected
next year’s student body president on
Monday, defeating two challengers
and avoiding a runoff by a five-vote
margin.

Menon, of Charles Town, W.Va.,
captured 50.4 percent of the 986 votes
cast. He was opposed by first-year
law student and Executive Commit-
tee representative William Thomp-
son of Boca Raton, Fla., who receiv-
ed 25.2 percent of the vote, and by
junior and student body vice presi-
dent Andrew Caruthers of Shreve-
port, La., who garnered 23 percent of
the vote.

Elected vice president was junior
Brandt Surgner of Philadelphia, and
the secretary will be junior Roby
Mize of Atlanta.

Surgner received 62.3 percent of
the vote to top classmate Paul
“Chief’’ Abbott of Richmond, and
Mize scored 53.3 percent to defeat
sophomore Rick Robins of Newport
News.

A little more than 57 percent of the
student body voted in Monday’s “Big
Three” election. Nearly 65 percent of
the Law School turned out, and about
55 percent of undergraduates voted.
The Law School poll drew 231 voters,
while the two polls on the undergrad-
uate campus — at the University
Library and in ‘“‘ODK Circle” be-
tween the Commerce School and the
Colonnade — together attracted 755.

The results took about 212 hours to
tabulate after polls closed at 4 p.m.
on post-Fancy Dress Monday, ac-
cording to Lou Mondello, Voting
Regulations Board co-chairman.

“Tt shouldn’t have been on the day
after Fancy Dress,”’ said Mondello.
“But the Constitution dictates when
we hold the election,’ The Student
Body Constitution says the “Big
Three”’ elections are to be held the
Monday of the 10th week of winter
term.

Menon said Fancy Dress may have
affected voting, but, he said, ‘‘voting

has always been after FD in my two
years here.”’

“Hopefully, this shows the Univer-
sity has confidence in me because
I’m definitely looking forward to the
challenge ahead.”

“Voting Monday after Fancy Dress
is ridiculous,’ said Thompson, the
only Law School candidate on Mon-
day’s ballot. ‘In the past we’ve been
seen as apathetic, [but this time]
over two-thirds of the Law School
turned out. I’m proud of their effort,’
he said.

“I was expecting a run-off between
Shayam and myself ...{but] it’s not
possible to run effectively without
solid undergraduate support,”’
Thompson said.

Although he felt ‘‘disappointment”’
about the results, Thompson believes
his candidacy has “sparked” the

FD ‘86: loose llama, lax liquor checks;

Ale, entertainment
said to be popular

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
and SYDNEY MARTHINSON
Staff Reporters

 

Last weekend’s packed, popular
Fancy Dress Ball was marred only
by a recalcitrant llama and a few
security problems, one of which
resulted in a Student Conduct Com-
mittee investigation.

Junior Rob Tolleson, the Student
Activities Board’s Fancy Dress
chairman, said a number of letters
have been received praising the
bash, which had as its theme ‘‘Car-
naval: A Night in Rio.”

“The entertainment turned out bet-
ter than most people had planned,”’
he said, adding that the Friday night
fireworks were ‘‘a huge hit.”’

Although no attendance figures are
yet available, Tolleson said a great
deal of beer was consumed, “‘par-
ticularly the Killian’s”’ Red ale.

“That went over real well because
there was more alcohol content,’ he
said. “I think it hit everybody at
once.”’

Tolleson said that if any Alcohol
Beverage Control Board agents had
been in Warner Center, ‘‘we would
have gotten slammed — the security
guys were just hanging around.”’

A llama rented from the Natural
Bridge Zoo to grace the ball entrance
escaped because zoo personnel did
not accompany it.

“Its head was facing away and I
guess someone moved it so they
could see its face,” Tolleson said.

During the evening, a fight erupted
between a second-year law student
and his date, a first-year student.
Proctor Charles F. ‘Murph’ Murray
said the student ‘‘slapped her pretty
good.” SCC Chairman Townes
Pressler said the matter is being in-
vestigated.

Weekend weather
heats up overnight

Fancy Dress weekend started with
topcoats and scarves but ended with
shirt sleeves and shorts as tempera-
tures climbed from frigid to balmy.

The warm weather will continue
through tomorrow but might be ac-
companied by showers, according to
the National Weather Service in
Roanoke.

This weekend, both fraternities
and couples took advantage of the
warm weather. For example, Phi
Delta Theta held a champagne
brunch at Zollman’s Pavilion, Sigma
Nu had a cookout and Pi Kappa
Alpha heard Heinsohn and Day at a
member’s house.

Molly Pressler, a junior from the
University of Texas at Austin who
came to Lexington for Fancy Dress,
said she and her date spent much of
the weekend outside driving on the
Blue Ridge Parkway and picnicking.

She said the change in weather ad-
ded to her fun weekend.

“T had a blast,” she said. ‘
really hard to go home.”

Friday and Saturday saw highs of
only 41 degrees but the temperatures
rose to a high of 71 Sunday and 73
Monday. Temperatures dropped
Tuesday and yesterday to the upper
60s.

The warm weather is being caused
by a high-pressure ridge blocking the
movement of cold air from Canada
into this area and allowing the pas-
sage of warmer air from the south-
east, according to National Weather
Service meteorologist Jan Jackson.

Jackson said this type of week-long
warm spell is common in the late
winter and early spring and will pro-
bably be followed by cold weather for
about two weeks

It was

Law School into a new era of student
government participation.

Menon agrees. He wants to
strengthen relations between the
Law School and the undergraduate
schools. Among his suggestions are
redesigning the Calyx to accom-
modate both schools, talking with
law students about their concerns
and clarifying the relationships be-
tween the EC and Law School advo-
cates appearing at honor hearings.

“In the past, there has been an
adversarial role between the EC and
the Law School advocates...We can
avoid this by discussing the rules of
the EC and the role of advocates ear-
ly in the year,’’ Menon said.

The other newly elected officers
echoed similar feelings. Mize spoke
of a “tension” that makes law
students ‘‘feel less a part of the

University. I can see where an under-
graduate might not vote for a candi-
date just because he’s a law stu-
dent.”’

Surgner said, ‘“‘I don’t know that
there’s much the FC can do. I think
people’s attitudes must change
first.”’

Caruthers said he is happy the elec-
tion is over.

“I’m happy Shayam got such a
mandate,” he said. ‘‘Shayam is a sin-
cere, dedicated individual commit-
ted to W&L and all it stands for...I
know the best man won,”

Both Caruthers and Thompson de-
clined to comment on whether they
might seek another office on the EC.

“T will certainly encourage Bill and
Andrew torun,’’ Menon said.

Profiles of the three winners of Mon-
day’s election appear on page 4.

Three people demonstrate the funnelator

Goliathbuster: Slingshot
is now ‘state of the art’

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Executive Editor

 

It dices. It slices. It pulverizes
windows. It lacerates people. All the
kids are doing it!

Yes, it’s the ‘‘Winger,”’ also known
as a “‘funnelator’’ or simply as a
giant slingshot. Get yours now for
$25, slashed from $30. And it comes
with a gross of balloons. What a
bargain!

But don’t even think about getting
caught with one in the dormitories.

‘We've discovered that potentially
they’re very harmful,’’ Dean of
Freshmen H. Robert Huntley said
yesterday.

Hence a new policy: Huntley this
week told Head Dormitory Counselor
Tom Mack to advise his colleagues to
confiscate the funnelators on sight.

The crackdown stems from an inci-
dent early Monday in which fresh-
men Jenny Bray and Kelley Putney
were showered with glass when a
funnelator-flung water balloon wing-
ed through Bray's window on the sec-

The Washington and Lee Stu-
dent Control Committee last week
changed its name to the Student
Conduct Committee

SCC Chairman Townes Pressler
said several members of the
Board of Trustees recently ex-
pressed an interest in making the
name change because it ‘‘sounded

ond floor of Graham-Lees Dormi-
tory.

“It just broke out one pane, but
when it hit, it kind of exploded,” Bray
recalled yesterday. “‘It hit the cur-
tain so hard (You know how curtain
rods come apart?) it...wrenched the
rod apart and threw it across the
room on top of Kelley. The glass hit
me in the back and it was in my hair
and the back of the legs.”’

Assistant Proctor William C.
“Burr” Datz, who inspected the
damage later that morning, said the
balloon had sailed about 150 feet from
the upper floor of a dormitory across
the street and hit with such force that
slivers of glass were embedded in
posters on the opposite side of the
room,

Because Bray had her back to the
window and Putney was lying on the
bed, neither was seriously injured

‘Had I been facing the window, I
would have had a face and eyes full of
glass,’ Bray said. “I didn’t get
shaken up until I realized how lucky

better.’’ The board had been con-
sidering the change for seven
years, Pressler said

The duties of the SCC, investi-
gating and acting upon com-
plaints of alleged student miscon-
duct that are not violations of the

Honor System, will remain the
same, Pressler said

 

 
 

 

OPINION
Challenge

‘‘T havea lot to prove,” president-elect Shayam Menon said
Monday night with a combination of anticipation and trepida-
tion.

He is correct for two reasons: First, the down side of
avoiding a runoff is that exactly half the people who voted
chose someone else; and, second, one of his opponents had
considerably more polish and experience. Neither of those,
though, is a fatal handicap; indeed, Menon already seems to
be using them as incentives to exert extra effort and energy
in pursuit of a successful term. He is a man bent on proving
his doubters wrong; we believe he will.

Menon promises to bring the student body a markedly dif-
ferent style of leadership from the other presidents of his stu-
dent generation. One of the other candidates said that if
elected, he planned to capitalize on the fortes and avoid the
foibles of the trio of presidents he’s worked under. With
enough support and savvy, Menon, too, can in some measure
capture the strengths of the idealistic Bob Jenevein, the af-
fable Cole Dawson and the charismatic John Lewis.

Our president-elect, though, is sufficiently perceptive to
realize he can never precisely duplicate any of his three
predecessors’ characteristics — and he ought not. Already
he’s talked of some innovative ideas for making the Honor
System more alive for students, and for communicating stu-
dent body sentiment to the trustees and faculty. Menon
knows what he has to work on, and some of the creative ap-

= he’s now formulating show he’s on exactly the right
rack.

One aspect of the election troubles us. Consider the matter
of Andrew Caruthers, who put three years of his college life
into serving the student body, only to be thrashed at the polls
when it came time for what should have been his coup de
grace. The student body has shown several times in recent
years that it doesn’t much care for ambitious student
politicos, and even the biggest Caruthers fan has to admit
that most people perceived him that way. It seems curious to
penalize a candidate for experience, but that is the lesson of
Andrew Caruthers, James White and Darby Brower.

A second issue this election raises is whether, as one can-
didate suggested, the freshmen have become the “king-
makers”’ in student body elections. Menon and Lewis both
are dormitory counselors, and having the freshman block
vote surely was a formidable advantage in both cases. We’re
not convinced, though, that being a dorm counselor should be
a prerequisite to being president.

Those two concerns, though, ought not detract from
Menon’s well-deserved victory. We believe he is up to his
task, and look forward to his attacking it with vigor.

If it ain’t broke...

Ah — for the open-minded thought of a law student. Or so I
thought when I read last week’s W&L Law News editorial,
‘‘Making sanctions fit offenses.”’

When I finished reading their argument for an end to the
single-sanction honor system, I began to wonder whether the
modern adage ‘garbage in, garbage out”’ really held true.

The single sanction stands as strong support for the Honor

_ System because it does not allow for degrees of honor. The
criminal system may allow for degrees of severity of a crime
(misdemeanor, felony, etc.), but the Honor System recog-
nizes only one factor in its considerations — guilt or in-
nocence.

_ In that sense, the Honor System is severe and the conse-

. quences of disobeying it are grave. Trust is to be earned and
not to be assumed.

The Honor System is not designed to measure up to any
legal principle that punishment is to fit the crime. The Honor
System has survived the test of time and been followed by
countless students over the years precisely because the
system operates independently of the administration and es-
tablished legal practice outside of the campus.

How law students — and many other outside observers
—fail to understand the single sanction system is obvious. It
is not a mini-legal system, where a lawyer can manipulate
the courtroom to his advantage, where every case depends
upon some maxim written in law books or where the judge
can decide on the admissability of evidence. To the contrary,
the system exists and operates as it does because every case
is decided on its own merits. Every student generation
decides what it considers honorable and dishonorable
behavior, and every student is expected to live up to that
principle for at feast the four years in which they study here.

Every student chooses Washington and Lee cognizant of
the contract into which they are entering. When that contract
is broken or trust is breached, action must be taken. That is
the finality — and the strength — of the single sanction.

Proportionality and compassion have nothing to do with
the W&L Honor System. Neither the idea of established
precedent nor reform has any relevance to the matter.

When is an election not an election?

 

By NELSON PATTERSON
Editorial Page Editor

 

There was something different
about last Monday's “Big Three’’
election. Sure, there was the rare oc-
currence of a candidate receiving a
majority of the votes cast, despite
having two opponents. There were
also the victories in the vice-
president and secretary spots, as
should be the case with only two can-
didates running. After all, we are not
in the Philippines.

But that is not what I am talking
about. I just felt that there was never
really a campaign underway.

Some might say that’s because I
am a senior, and seniors, by defini-
tion, love to wreak havoc on future
generations by voting for the can-
didate with the highest flap factor
(though I don’t think most seniors did
this year) or write-in some odd or
comical name for one of the three of-
fices. Seniors, after all, don’t have to
live under the consequences of their
actions. It’s that same attitude ex-
pressed by a law school graduate in

Toles

WONDER WHAT

the recently arrived Calyx: “I’m not
going to be here next year, so I don’t
much give a damn. They ought to
bomb this place back into the Stone
Age.” Nice attitude.

Maybe it didn’t feel like a real elec-
tion because I only got one campaign
letter in my carrel in the library.
Although that letter contained plenty
of trite campaign promises and cat-
chy sayings (what else is election
advertising about?), it still was not
sufficient to hold my attention for
long or stifle my yawn. Another day,
another night, another election.

Then again, I didn’t help count
ballots as I have in past years, so
maybe that is why I did not feel as
though this was a real election. The
excitement (and the long hours of
work in counting ballots) associated
with the election process really peaks
with the ballot counting. I guess it
has something to do with the “I-
knew-who-won-before-you-did” _at-
titude. This time, I didn’t know very
early at all.

Maybe it was the lack of pretty
bedsheets that mattered. There were
no bedsheets hanging from every
building in the vicinity of a polling

 

 

area. I wasn’t able to admire the can-
didate who misspelled his name or
the office he was seeking. I was not
treated to the latest in psychedelic
paints to catch and hold my atten-
tion. Nor was I able to make some
sort of judgment on the candidate ac-
cording to the type of sneaker or shoe
that dangles from the sheet corners
and occasionally bumps into the
classroom window on a breezy day.
The Voting Regulations Board decid-
ed to contribute to campus beautifi-
cation by banning bedsheets for the
elections this year. The campus can
look sort of ratty with last evening’s
sheet hanging from Newcomb Hall.
Aesthetic appeal, after all, stands on-
ly next to academic rigor.

Maybe it had something to do with
the rapid end to the Big Three elec-
tion with Shayam Menon’s surprising
capture of a majority of the vote for
president on the first ballot. Since
Washington and Lee does not have
the reputation of making quick or
rapid decisions, the majority vote
came asa surprise.

I know, however, that my lack of
enthusiasm did not stem from a lack
of familiarity with the candidates.

~ A LITTLE HOMELAND
OF YOUR OWN, P.W

The Phi’s coverage of last week’s
candidate debate and the profiles of
the various students, coupled with
the fact that I know a few of them,
made them more than “faces in a
crowd.”’

But that alone is not enough to stop
me from wondering what was differ-
ent about the election. I am not sure I
even know what the difference is or if
there even existed one at all. The
sense of urgency in having to vote, of
being the one to know what happen-
ed, of helping in the creation of the
latest in Fieldcrest sheet campaign
“posters,’’ of putting up posters and
telling friends why I am voting as I
am — all of that was absent.

I am led to believe that many other
students felt the same way, accord-
ing to a statement by an EC member
at Monday night’s meeting. Having
80 less sheets hanging around the
campus is sure to make a difference
in how one views an election, but can
it matter that much?

Probably not.

Though I cannot vote in the next
election, I wonder if students will feel
the same way. I hope not.

EEE
Clarification

A quotation by freshman
Valerie Pierson about the In-
dependent Union in The Ring-tum
Phi of Feb. 27 was correct but
lacked context. Her comment that
“they haven’t been able to
4 organize anything in the past’
was meant to refer to a lack of
participation by members, not a
lack of effort by IU officials.

 

 

 

University situation ethics angers alumnus

 

Editors’ Note: The author of this letter forwarded
a copy to The Ring-tum Phi for publication.

Board of Trustees
Washington & Lee University
Lexington, Virginia

Gentlemen:

As an interviewer-alumnus I am under the
onus to emphasize the importance of the Honor
System to prospective students. My son, who has
been virtually brainwashed concerning such
matters of honor, may well apply at W&L. Yet,
both of us are having an ethical problem trying
to reconcile articles appearing in The Ring-tum
Phi relating to students being convicted of petty
larceny and drug offenses still being retained in
the University.

There is such a thing as fraud and breach of
implied warranty involved in this issue as well as
matters of honor.

In law, whenever we wish to discredit the word
of a witness under oath, one method applied is to
ask if the person has ever been convicted of a
crime. Upon an affirmative answer, he is reduc-
ed from an honest citizen to that of a cad whose
word is to be doubted by all citizens,

If Washington and Lee confers a degree upon
the ilk of miscreants who lurk among the ivy

 

 

covered columniation, and that graduate has

been convicted of petty or grand larceny or drug
dealing or possession of the destroyer of civiliza-
tions, i.e., cocaine, the Board of Trustees is im-
pliedly warranting that he is a gentleman, one to
be trusted, an honorable man who does not
cheat, lie, or steal, or who is not a convicted
felon. If one relies upon that implied warranty
and employs that thug-alumnus in a position of
trust, and he continues his lifestyle of stealing,
lying, cheating, and breaking the laws, then the
University has breached that warranty, and I
believe committed a fraud upon the public who
has grown to respect that institution based upon
past reputation and representation.

There is precedent for damages being award-
ed for passing a student through college when in
truth and fact that student did not pass the re-
quired curriculum.

But aside from all that, I still am having trou-
ble reconciling in my ground base of ethics learn-
ed from my professors at W&L the present
stance of the University in not expelling a stu-
dent who has been convicted of a crime involving
moral turpitude, such as stealing, lying, using
someone's credit card to obtain merchandise, or
violating the drug laws of this country. I recall a
student being expelled from the University for
adding sand to our samples to be tested in order
to slow his fellows down in Doctor Gilreath’s
qualitative analysis. Is this crime any different

from the tolerance of a student who obtains food
from the student union cafeteria and failing to
pay for it?

If you allow such thugs to carry the honor of
“Washington & Lee Graduate,” a great disser-
vice is done to the Honor System and the
students who are expected to mold their lives
after it; and a collossal fraud is being
perpetrated upon every prospective employer,
every potential father-in-law or wife, and the
public at large.

It is not the office of the university to
rehabilitate criminals; it is not the office of the
university to classify crimes as academic and
others as social. A man is a thief if he steals
grades just as he is a thief who steals money or
credit cards; a man is a criminal if he hides
library source materials from his fellow students
as is the man who hides cocaine from law en-
forcement officials.

Perhaps I missed something in my ethics class
at W&L; perhaps I need to take a refresher
course in logic. But at this time, I feel you have
adopted situation ethics and should subscribe to
“Playboy” for the library in order to provide
philosophical material of more modern propor-
tions.

Very truly yours,
Lawrence A.G. Johnson

The Ring-tum Phi, March 13, 1986

 

 

 

By JIM STRADER
Editor

A revision in the class finance
system last year has led to problems
in arranging class parties at Wash-
ington and Lee, according to Townes
Pressler, senior class president.

Each academic class used to main-
tain its own bank account — compos-
ed of money from the sale of class
passes — to finance class parties,
Pressler said.

Last year, however, Darby
Brower, president of the Class of
1985, directed that the four accounts
be combined and asked Louis Cella,
then-president of the sophomore
class and treasurer for all four
classes, to administer the fund. The
new system has made it difficult for
each class to know how much money
it has, according to some of the class
officers.

Brower said yesterday from Tam-
pa, Fla., that he thought the money
would earn higher interest if'it were
in a combined fund rather than in
separate accounts.

Pressler remembers Brower’s rea-
soning differently. “I think it was
because he wanted more money for
the senior class party,” he said.

Cella said that to keep track of how
much money each class had, he drew
up a list of the different amounts that
each contributed to the fund, along
with a breakdown of the interest.

“Everything was accounted for,”
Brower confirmed. “There were
separate amounts for each class and

IFC vote set
for Monday

Editor

the interest it would make.’’ He ad-
ded that each class president was
given a limit on how much of the fund
was his to use.

Cella said that when he received
control of the money last year, the
sophomore class had the greatest
sum of the four accounts. Because of
the change in Virginia’s legal drink-
ing age, his class was unable to have
alcohol at class parties and subse-
quently didn’t spend money from its
account.

The junior and senior classes last
year — both with students above the
legal drinking age — had spent most
of their money on parties throughout
the year, Cella said.

This left the greatest amount in the
hands of the class that could not
spend it on alcohol for class parties
—the sophomores.

When the funds were combined,
Cella said, he and then vice president
of the sophomore class Walker
McKay ‘‘were adamant about keep-
ing our share separate.”

Cella said he gave the list detailing
the money each class had in the ac-
count to Brower at the end of last
year so that Brower could forward it
to the next treasurer.

“If Darby or someone lost that
list,’ Cella said, ‘‘no one knows how
much each class has.”

Brower said he gave the list to
Associate Dean of Students Michael
A. Cappeto at the end of the year with
other Student Control Committte
material to pass along to Pressler.

Pressler said he did not receive
any information on the class ac-

counts this fall and consequently has
no record of exactly how much each
class has to spend from the common
fund. The problem this has caused,
he explained, is that all of the classes
want to have parties, but there isn’t
enough money to finance them

Junior class president Mike
McAllister, who took control of the
class money from Cella this year,
said the balance of the fund as of Feb
21 was $3,204

This amount does not take into ac-
count money owed to the Student Ac-
tivities Board for a band party co-
sponsored by the junior class and the
SAB earlier this year. SAB Chairman
Mike Guerriero said the juniors’
share of the cost of putting on the par-
ty, which featured the Spongetones,
was $1,000.

McAllister said he sees little use in
trying to determine how much money
each class has. ‘‘I’ve been to the bank
and sat down with the people there to
try to figure it out.” he said.

The bank had no records of the
separate accounts, McAllister said,
and it would be more trouble than it’s
worth to resolve the matter. He sug-
gested that the sophomore and junior
classes evenly split whatever money
is left in the account at the end of this
year and start again from scratch.

“It’s come to that, I think,” he
said.

McAllister said he couldn’t under-
stand why Brower decided to com-
bine the class funds. ‘‘That was pret-
ty stupid on Darby’s part,’’
McAllister said, ‘‘because the money
would earn the same interest rate in

Mixed fund hinders parties

smaller accounts.”’

“And it was also pretty stupid on
his part because there's no record of
how much money each class has,”’ he
continued

In order to prevent similar pro-
blems, Pressler proposed adding
class dues to the student tax, which is

paid with each year’s tuition. He said
he plans to make this proposal to the
Board of Trustees at its May
meeting

Pressler did away with class dues
last year for several reasons. Among
these was the change in the drinking
age, which made planning parties
difficult because a majority of the
school was underage.

In addition, Pressler said, many
students in recent years have ignored
the dues. which were paid for by buy-
ing a class pass. This lack of support,
combined with other difficulties in
fundraising, also contributed to
Pressler’s decision.

Pressler said a student tax would
be a simpler way to ensure that
classes would be able to have parties,
once their members are of legal age.
He added that it would make more
sense for classes to start their funds
as freshmen and let the money earn
interest until they are of legal age
“so that when they can have a party,
it’s a good one.”

Pressler said the senior class par-
ty, which he is responsible for plan-
ning, will cost approximately $2,000.
Each member of the senior class
paid $10 at the beginning of the year
to finance the party, which will be
held just before graduation.

NEWS BRIEFS

Mollenhoff speaks
on differences in

U.S.-U.K.

By JOHN PENSEC
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

Although much of American tradi-
tion in law, government and jour-
nalism come from Great Britain,
Washington and Lee Journalism Pro-
fessor Clark R. Mollenhoff said Mon-
day evening there are great dif-
ferences in the countries’ systems.

Northen Auditorium was filled to
capacity when Mollenhoff spoke of
his experiences studying the British
media.

For five months last fall, Mollen-
hoff was an exchange Fellow at Uni-
versity College, Oxford. Investigat-
ing the British press system for a
prolonged period gave Mollenhoff a
well-rounded view of that system.

The British press is ‘‘a little more
classy”’ than its American counter-
part, and journalists in England have
a much better understanding of the
law, Mollenhoff said. ‘“!'hey have*
to,” he continued, ‘‘or they’d be
thrown in jail.”’

The British Official Secrets Act
makes it illegal both to release and
receive government information.

The Official Secrets Act was origi-

media

nally enacted to protect national
security, but over the years, Mollen-
hoff said, the governments have
abused the power the act gives them.

Since Great Britain is governed
under a parliamentary system, the
administration of the sitting prime
minister takes part in making laws.
Unlike the U.S. government, there is
no system of checks and balances,
Mollenhoff said.

The separation of powers that ex-
ists in this country limits the abuses
of authority by individuals, although
Mollenhoff said there are exceptions.
U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Wein-
berger and the Defense Department
often act as an independent body he
said. The Department of Defense has
its own auditing agency; all other
government agencies are audited by
the General Accounting Office.

Other differences between the two
systems include the U.S. Freedom of
Information Act, which makes much
information available to the public.
Mollenhoff said he used the act when
investigating whistleblowers in the
Defense Department.

Under the British system, ‘‘I’d be
in jail every three weeks,’ Mollen-
hoff said.

Rutgers Chi Psis lift W&L office equipment during FD

Staff Reports

 

Twenty-two Rutgers University freshmen from the
Chi Psi social fraternity raided Washington and Lee
this weekend, collecting but later returning more than
$1,000 in ‘‘Hill’’ office equipment. W&L’s chapter of Chi
Psi had no connection with the incident.

According to Proctor Charles F. ‘Murph’ Murray,
the students removed a clock, office phone, computer
disks and other software from Newcomb Hall; a projec-
tor and an office phone from the Commerce School; a
television set and two fire extinguishers from Graham-
Lees dormitory; and office telephones from Payne and
Lewis halls.

The students were caught by University security of-
ficials when the visitors tried to lift a television set over
the fence surrounding the W&], Chi Psi “‘lodge’’ on Lee
Avenue.

Associate Dean of Students Dan N. Murphy said he
contacted the dean of fraternities and sororities at
Rutgers, as well as the national chapter of the fraterni-
ty, resulting in the return of the equipment on Tuesday

to Computer Center Director Thomas C. Imeson.

Imeson said the University will take no additional ac-
tion against the students because the goods were
returned.

The Rutgers students come every year, according to
W&L’s Chi Psi president senior Joe Whelan who
described the actions as ‘‘totally out of control.”’

“We're very unhappy with them for dragging our
name into the mud,” he said.

Police list weekend offenses

Freshman Peter Parker, of Lynchburg, was charged
with disorderly conduct March 8 after a March 1 inci-
dent in front of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house.

The police report stated that Officer G.P. Joines was
driving past the fraternity at approximately 3:47 a.m.
when Parker threw an object at Joines’ patrol car and
shouted an obscenity.

After talking to the assistant commonwealth’s at-
torney, the report continued, Joines reduced the charge
from throwing a missile at a moving object — a felony

— to the misdemeanor of disorderly conduct. Parker is
scheduled to appear in Lexington General District
Court on April 22.

eJames C. Kephart, class of 1985, of San Antonio, Tex-
as, was charged with unlawful burning and being drunk
in public early Saturday morning after allegedly setting
a mattress on fire outside a Nelson Street house.

A court date for Kephart has been set for March 25 in
Lexington General District Court.

eA car owned by Thomas E. Meehan, of Houston, was
damaged early Sunday morning while it was parked
outside Baker Dormitory. The police report stated the
roof was collapsed and there was a single footprint on
the roof.

There are no witnesses or suspects in the case.

There was a rash of tire slashings last week in
University parking lots.

Between 4 p.m. and midnight on March 3, the left
tires on a car owned by law student James Cargill were
slashed in the Law School parking lot. Damage was
estimated at $120.

eThat same night, the rear tires on law student
Lawrence Codispoti’s car were also destroyed in the

Law School parking lot. Damage was estimated at $130.

eAll four tires on freshman George Sparacio’s car
were slashed March 3 while it was in the parking lot
next to the lacrosse practice field. Damage was
estimated at $300.

¢On March 5, the left front tire of law student Bryan
Bishop’s car was slashed in the Law School parking lot,
causing $75 worth of damages.

Sophomore Kevin Webb’s left rear tire was slashed
in a parking lot on McDowell Street the same evening.
Damage was estimated at $10v.

eThe third car vandalized that evening belonged to
sophomore David Bekenstein. Both right tires on his
car were destroyed, causing an estimated $200 worth of
damage.

Police Chief L.O. Sutton said he sent evidence to the
state laboratory to see if the tire slashings were all done
by the same person.

Sutton said he is pleased that Fancy Dress weekend
passed uneventfu!ly. This year’s FD was ‘“‘less noisy,
less ... violent’ than the other two he has been in town
for, he said.

Junior Shayam Menon, who on
Monday was elected to one of the
most demanding positions on campus
— student body president — says he’s
‘just a regular guy’’ who’s ready to
take on the job’s responsibility.

Beating two other candidates
without needing a runoff — the first
time that’s happened since 1982
— Menon clearly was the students’
choice, and he says he recognizes a
huge responsiblility in being presi-
dent.

Menon’s activities, besides being
an Executive Committee represen-
tative the past two years, have in-
cluded being a member of the Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee, the
student-alumni. association Kathe-
kon, and Phi Kappa Psi social frater-
nity, following the New York
Yankees, listening to music, and ma-
joring in business administration.

He says he is going to have to give
up some of those activities.

“‘Beforehand, you have to make the
decision that you’re committed and
that [being president] is going to
take up your time,”’ he said.

Which isn’t to say that he’s wary of

we were.”

A poster in Graham-Lees advertis-
ing the slingshot notes that the device
“represents the essence of...safety”’
but that “‘serious injury and property
damage are real possibilities.”’

‘Confused? The flyer, which in-
cludes the name, dorm room and tel-
ephone number of a freshman sales
representative, sports this helpful
postscript: ‘‘Exercise good judgment
when using this product.”

Huntley said the three freshmen
who hurled the balloon turned them-
selves in immediately and did not in-
tend the action at all “intentionally
or maliciously.”

Nevertheless, the Student Conduct
Committee is investigating the mat-
ter, according to Datz.

Datz, a 1975 Washington and Lee
graduate, said that when he was in
school, he and his friends used to con-
struct a similar device out of surgical
tubing and a pail and ‘‘go out in the
moonlight and shoot it at cows.”

He says the ‘Winger’ is just a
“state of the art’’ version of the same
gadget. ‘‘It shows how technological
kids are these days,’’ he said.

taking the job.

“I’m really looking forward to this.
I want to start doing things right
away.”

Responding to an editorial in last
week’s Ring-tum Phi that said he
would be a “caretaker president,’’
Menon said he welcomed the con-
structive criticism.

“‘T haven’t been the most vocal guy
on the committee this year,” he said,
but he knows he is going to have to
develop his public speaking and lead-
ership skills.

He also has new ideas for next
year’s EC, including having the
whole committee design the fresh-
man orientation in the spring and
sending fraternity presidents letters
saying that reports of stolen road
signs would be investigated as honor
violations, although the student gen-
eration would have to decide if each
case is an honor violation.

When asked if he considered him-
self a minority, Menon said no.

“‘T've always felt very strongly that
if you think of yourself as a minority,
you'll be treated as a minority.”’

Menon’s parents are from India,
but he was born in Kettering, Eng-
land, and has lived the last 10 years
in Charles Town, W.Va.

Junior Brandt Surgner, the winner
in Monday’s vice-presidential elec
tion, attributes his victory to his in-
volvement in campus activities and
name recognition among students.

Surgner, an economics major from
Philadelphia, said this week that
after graduation, he plans to go into
some form of banking.

Surgner has been involved in
several campus activities. He is cur-
rently vice president of Kathekon,
the student alumni association, and
is a member of the Cold Check Com-
mittee, the Voting Regulations Board
and the Student Recruitment Com-
mittee. Last year he was on the White
Book Revisions Committee, and he
recently completed a term as presi-
dent of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.

Surgner’s off-campus interests are
squash, hunting and ‘‘a lot of tennis
anda lot of golf.”

Describing the most interesting
moment in his campaign, Surgner
said: ‘‘While I was getting signatures
for my petition, I walked into a room
where a group of girls were and they
started grilling and asking me all

His campaign consisted of putting
posters up around campus, slipping
letters under freshman doors and go-
ing to the Law School to meet law
students.

When asked why he thought he beat
his opponent, Paul ‘‘Chief’’ Abbott,
Surgner said he thought it was
because he participates in more
school activities and his name is bet-
ter known among students.

Surgner had mentioned the tension
between upperclassmen and fresh-
man women as a problem during his
campaign. ‘“‘Next year, a lot of it is
going to be resolved by itself.”

He added that the presence of
freshman and sophomore women will
help the situation. He also urged that
students “be very fair and con-
siderate when people are applying
for committee positions.”

Surgner said he agrees with the EC
decision not to appoint a non-voting

are to get ‘‘more in-depth introduc-

Although the job of Executive Com-
mittee secretary will make further
demands on Roby Mize’s already
crammed schedule, the junior said
this. week that self-discipline and
sacrifice will allow him to make the
necessary commitment to the posi-
tion.

In fact, his schedule almost
prevented him from entering the
race. “It was a last-minute deci-
sion,’’ Mize said. ‘‘I’d had some sec-
ond thoughts about it because it’s a
big decision. I know it’s a large time
commitment, but it isn’t a matter of
not having enough time — it’s a ques-
tion of making a sacrifice.”

Because the decision to run came
so late, Mize said he had little time to
collect signatures for his petition, but
says his campaign was anything but
vigorous.

“I was pretty lazy,’’ he admitted.
His major campaign efforts were to
hang posters around campus and
participate in the EC-sponsored can-
didates’ forum.

The races for secretary and vice

 

president, were between candidates +
with no EC experience. Mize said he,
was surprised EC representatives
did not run for the other ‘‘Big Three’’+
offices.

«

Although he admits experience 4
would be an asset, Mize said it is not ¢ ©

essential for the job. Motivation and ,
common sense are attributes Mize

feels are more important. a

This year’s EC has been “‘fairly ,
diligent” in the performance of its

duties, Mize said. He doesn’t see * —

himself exerting a great influence +
over the character of the committee ,
next year.

“There’s really not too much room *
for change, especially for the secre- ,
tary,”’ Mize said.

In addition to his new responsibili- *
ty on the EC, Mize is a two-year let- -
terman on the tennis team and a ,
member of the Student Recruitment
Committee and Phi Delta Theta fra- *
ternity. He also competes on several ,

‘Lax throttles Tech,

sets school record;

‘Dartmouth is next

| By DAVID EMRICH
Assistant Sports Editor

Here it is, the official short version
the Virginia Tech lacrosse team’s
ig afternoon: W&L 28, Virginia
-ch 1. Kind of self-explanatory.
The Hokies arrived in Lexington on
‘Saturday to oppose the Generals
before the Fancy Dress Weekend
crowd, but the Tech athletes didn’t
manage to provide much opposition,
falling to W&L for the sixth straight
time.

This time W&L set a school record
for the number of goals scored on
its way to the rout of the overmatch-
ed Virginia Tech team. In order to
find a similar offensive showing by
the Generals one would have to
travel back almost 13 years, to the
afternoon of April 18, 1973, when
W&L put 26 goals on the board
against Duke.

“We had hoped for a little more
competitive situation,’”’ said coach
Dennis Daly. ‘‘But we were happy to
get everyone into the game, and were
very pleased by the performances of

the young players. They executed
well, stayed with the game plan, and
did what they had to do,”’ said Daly.

W&L raced to a 7-0 lead by the end
of the first quarter on the strength of
a hat trick by senior attackman G.T.
Corrigan. The lone Hokie goal came
in the second quarter when a loose
ball in front of the W&L goal was bat-
ted into the net.

From there, W&L took control
again, amassing a 14-1 lead at the
half and a 22-1 margin after three
quarters. W&L used three goalies
— starter John Church and sopho-
mores Paul Burke and Rob Buttara-
zi.

The Generals’ offensive production
was up from the Duke loss in more
than one category. W&L took 65 shots
on Saturday, two-and-a-half times as
many as the the shot total against
Duke. The Generals also won 29 of
the game’s 32 faceoffs.

Despite the rout, Daly felt there
was still room for improvement.
“The little time we were on defense,
we weren’t happy with the execu-
tion,’ said Daly. ‘We didn’t feel we

The Ring-tum Phi, March 13, 1986

were keeping them out the way we
should have been.”’

“The game gave us a chance to get
everyone into the game, and it got
our record to .500, and that’s always
good,” continued Daly. ‘‘But we’re
not sure that we’re a better team
execution-wise and tempo-wise.”’

Sunday, W&L will host Dartmouth,
a team which Daly said “plays with
emotion and is very physical.’ He
added, ‘‘Dartmouth is a team we
should be able to compete with.”’

“Of course, a little luck always helps,
too.”’

Leading the Generals into action
this spring will be senior captains
Chris Bleggi, Chris McGowan and
Jim McLaughlin. Bleggi was recent-
ly named ODAC Runner-of-the-Year
on the indoor circuit.

Aside from the captains, Aldridge
cited hurdier Andy White and utility

man John White as major contribu-
tors. Andy holds school records in
both the 110-meter and 400-meter
burdles, while John competes in four
events: the long jump, the triple
jump, sprints and relays.

The distance runners include Rich
Moore, Scott Rippeon, Ash Andrews,
Conrad Boyle, Jamie Urso and J.J.
Boquet. John Burlingame leads the
team in the long jump as does
Townes Pressler in the high jump. In-
door conference champion Tom Mur-
ray will handle the shot-putting
duties and Mike McAlevey will con-

centrate on the javelin. The pole
vaulting will be done by John Carder,
Joe Fisher and Rob Williamson.

Coach Aldridge said he is also hop-
ing that injured Matt Steilberg will
be able to come back and offer help to
the team in the pole vault.

Rounding out the team are sprint-
ers Bill Rhinehart and Kevin
Weaver.

The first home meet will be Tues-
day when the Generals play host to

Bridgewater and Eastern Mennonite
in a tri-meet.

W&L ‘9’ loses, ties in openers

 

By CHARLES T. GAY
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee baseball
team’s season opener was spoiled by
West Virginia Tech, 5-1,
but the Generals managed to salvage
a 5-5 tie in the doubleheader’s second
game.

W&L was stymied in the opener by
Tech hurler Jeff Thompson, who last-
ed all seven innings and allowed only
one run on seven hits in registering
the win.

_ In the meantime, W&L pitcher Bill
Schoettelkotte was touched for five
earned runs in 63 innings.

The Generals’ lone hitting star was
first-baseman Bill Curtiss, who col-
lected three singles in three at-bats.

The doubleheader’s final innings

were a seesaw battle. The Generals
entered the game’s final frame with
a 4-3 lead, but Tech outfielder Tracy
Gilmore put his side ahead with a
two-run double. The Generals knot-
ted the score by scratching for a run
in the bottom of the seventh.

Tennis: Men ‘psyched’ despite losses...

» The Washington and Lee tennis
team is encountering some of the dif-
“ficulties of a young team working to
»put its season in gear the year after a
season of great success.
" Having lost three matches to Divi-
esion I teams and knowing that
, the weekend which could decide
whether they make nationals is only
+a little more than a week away, the
,Generals are taking their young

season in stride.

“Realistically, we didn’t plan on
beating those teams [Penn State,
James Madison and Virginia Tech],”’
senior captain Scott Adams com-
mented. “It would have been nice,
especially being so close against
James Madison [a 5-4 loss], but that
match was a big improvement over
last year.”

‘Friday, the Generals travel to
Christopher Newport, a match that
likely will give the team its first win
of the season and, according to team

members, a satisfying reminder of
the thrill of victory.

Saturday, W&L will
against William and Mary.

Looming in the near future is next
weekend’s trip to Philadelphia where
the Generals will play two of the na-
tion’s best teams, No. 1-ranked Swar-
thmore and No. 6-ranked Claremont.

“7 think we have the right attitude
going into it. We’re real psyched up,”
Adams said. ‘I think everyone feels
that they’re playing well, it’s just a
matter of winning the right match at
the right time.”

‘...Women ‘out-talented’ in early matches

The Washington and Lee women’s

Golf returns starters, expects to benefit

The Washington and Lee men’s
golf team, which was forced to play a
lineup without any returning letter-
men last year, has the luxury of hav-
ing the top four players back this
season.

The season starts this weekend
when the Generals take part in the
James Madison Invitational in Har-
risonburg.

Despite the lack of experience, tne
1985 men’s team finished with a 5-1
_record and a fourth-place in the Old
“Dominion Athletic Conference tour-
nament. The team’s first four posi-
tions were held by All-ODAC Greg
Wheeler, Gary Campbell, Mark
Zavatsky and Chip Gist, all of whom
are back in the Generals’ lineup in
1986.

Overemphasis vs.
proper emphasis

....F rank Deford told a Lee Chapei
audience last Wednesday that ‘‘we
can never de-emphasize sports” but
that we ought not ‘“‘overemphasize”’
sports. Granted, such a_ senti-
ment is an admirable one. We are
thus acknowledging that athletic
competition tends to get us all ex-
cited, but at the same time we need
to keep that excitement in perspec-
tive. As the writer noted, this must especially be the case in the realm
of intercollegiate athletics.

The question we must ask Mr. Deford is: ‘‘Can the intercollegiate
sports world walk the fine line between proper emphasis and improper
emphasis?” The examples where the fine line has been jumped over,
most often on the Division I level, are there for the counting. Now, of
course, it’s not universal overemphasis, but one that comes from a few
coaches and administrators who think that success in athletics
(mistakenly defined solely in terms of wins and losses) is how a col-
lege should define overall success.

But we’re not talking about the corruption-laden programs here.
Their problems are clear. What isn’t clear is what happens when an
athletic program does everything it can simply to do its best? Is that
an oeveremphasis? Such a thought is scary because it can easily hit
home at a mild-mannered Division III institution like Washington and
Lee.

Is there a difference between providing an adequate opportunity for
athletic participation and providing the best opportunity for athletic
participation? And is that difference a bad thing? What I’m getting
at is whether it’s fair that Washington and Lee can provide the
facilities and programs that it does for a sport like football and com-
pete on an even basis with other schools that do not have the resources
that W&L has.

Is it overemphasis to have something like the Barbell Club? Is it
overemphasis to have the tennis team (at its own expense) travel to
Staunton so many times a week to play indoors during the winter mon-
ths? Is it overemphasis to decide to send the baseball and lacrosse
teams (at their own expense) to Florida over Washington Holiday?

What I can reasonably offer is that W&L is providing the best oppor-
tunity for its teams to do their best. And who can find fault with that
philosophy? Well, on its face, no one can. But if sports mean this much
at a small-time college, one has some indication of how they can come
to mean too much at a big-time university.

What I’m lamenting is that somewhere the simple ideal that sports
are nothing more than games and should be played for the fun of it
cannot work anymore. (Deford said that may never have been the
case, anyway.) In essence, it seems that as we organize our games
more and more, they become less and less fun and more and more
work.

The phrase that sticks in my mind is the practice-field charge: ‘It’s
the price you have to pay now that will bring you success in the game.”’
When does that price become too high and how do we make sure that it

lead vocal, however, it seems im
probable that this brooding number
will ever find a place in radio-land.

Or take ‘I Held Her In My Arms”’

a song with “hit single”’ written all
over it. It sounds like some great lost
Phil Spector number or perhaps a
Springsteen tune stolen from the
Boss’ back pocket. The problem
is that it is about an adolescent boy’s
confusion about his sexuality.

That is the way this whole record
is. Calling it ‘The Blind Leading The
Naked” is certainly no accident as
each song seems to be one thing but
turns out to be something else entire-
ly.

“Special” starts out as a happy
rocker about a girl and turns out to be
a terrifying study of obsession and
homicide. The scary ‘‘Candlelight
Song” depicts a deranged/retarded
character who hears morning/of the
deepest kind.” He laments that
his ‘doll is dead’’ while the music
twists in minor chords and dissonant
guitar lines behind him.

So, you figure it out. The music is
odd, rocking, scary, exhilerating and
entertaining. The lyrics are just plain
weird. And if Gordon Gano occasion-
ally copies the Velvet Underground
(“Good Friend,’’ ‘‘Two People’’),
that’s OK by me. This deserves to be
a hit. If it doesn’t make it, you can’t
blame them for not trying.

‘F/X’ and the underdog

 

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

There is something about under-
dogs that appeals to the American
public. So often we root for these
seemingly hapless, hopeless wonders
until something good happens for
them. Villanova gave us the oppor-
tunity to cheer the underdog in sports
recently, and “F/X’’ provides us
with a fast-paced, action film that
gives movie audiences the same op-
portunity.

Australian Bryan Brown (‘‘Break-
er Morant’”) plays Rollie Tyler, a
New York special effects expert who
is hired by the Justice Department to
fake the assassination of a witness in
a mob-related case. After doing his
job, however, attempts are made on
Tyler’s life, one of which kills his
girlfriend, and he realizes that he is
in the unenviable position of being
alone with no authorities to help him.
In fact, it is the authorities who are
out to kill him, and his only recourse
is to try to strike back using his
special effects know-how.

An interesting subplot also de-
velops when a New York police de-
tective gets involved in the investiga-
tion of the death of Tyler’s girlfriend.
Versatile Brian Dennehey

(“Silverado,’’ “Cocoon’’) plays the
wise-eracking, no-nansence Ten Me-
Carthy, who tries to piece together
the connections in the Tyler-related
killings.

As has happened so often recently,
Dennehey turns in a solid character
performance; one just might call
him the Charles Durning of the 1980s.
Brown, meanwhile, handles the star-
ring role with great skill.

The real stars of ‘“F/X’’ though,
are the props and gags Tyler uses
throughout. This man loves playing
with his know-how, and his do-or-die
predicament is the ultimate test of
his skills. The audience remains in
suspense, always suspecting some-
thing is not quite what it seems to be,
yet never knowing just what is

~ wrong. Still, it is ironic to note that in

a movie so laden with effects and ac-
tion, the movie’s own effects are done
sloppily on occasion, but

overall success of the picture.

And that is the point I should pro-
bably stress most: ‘‘F/X”’ is a suc-
cessful picture. It has style, pacing,
suspense and action. Add in the two
likeable and dependable stars, and
you have a movie that should not be
missed.
