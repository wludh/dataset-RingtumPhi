HEADS OR TAILS’ UNMATCHED SUCCESS

Spring Concert Presents

Second Musical By Danzansky
Opens To Sell-Out Audience

By HENRY M. STROUSS

To a healthy supply of his own
original melodies, Steve Danzansky
has added a sprinkling of tunes by
Brahms, W. C. Handy, and Rimsky-
Korsakov, and adapted a plot by
Aristophanes to produce his rollick-
ing new SWMSFC musical “Heads or
Tails,” to be presented at the Troub-
adour Theatre nightly through Sat-
urday.

As the plot revolves around 125,-
000 Athenian women who go on a
love strike to keep their husbands
home from war, there are numerous
occasions throughout the evening
where Danzansky could have ar-
ranged a spectacle of debauchery
to rival any of those in the SWMSFC
minstrel show era. However, Dan-
zansky has used restraint by con-
centrating on the development of
entertaining characters, frequent
choral numbers, and colorful settings
to carry the audience interest. He
has allowed the ancient Greeks to
reveal his philosophy largely
through implication.

The standout performer in “Heads
or Tails” is Andy Leonard. Portray-
ing the Councilor of Athens, Gal-
lupolonius, he carries his role well
in every respect. The patter-like
delivery of his songs is extremely
precise and distinct. His facial ex-
pressions and his gesticulations as
he is defeated by the women’s plot
are superb.

As the cold, beautiful captain of
the women’s plot, Debbie Doherty is
most effective. Her handsome stage
bearing and sincere delivery keep
eyes glued to her every moment she
is on stage. That is, except when her
cousin from Sparta, played by Nancy
Duncan, is present. This “Southern
Belle” according to the plot had
had six husbands all killed off in
war. From the total exuberance of
Miss Duncan’s performance one
might conject that she wouldn’t
need a war to kill her husbands off!
The two best songs in the musical
are in her hands and she delivers
them with ease.

In “Make Hay While the Sun
Shines!” Miss Duncan presents the
play’s basic theme, and in “We’ve
Put a Hex on Sex,” closing with
a rousing chorus of “Zeus Bless our
Happy Home” that is hysterically
corny, she wraps the totally befud-

 

 

dled Gallupolonius around her fing-
ers with comic facility.

Cal deColigny’s rich voice help him
earry the musical’s major romantic
intrest. Tom Andrew is amusing
in his Oedipian affair with Valerie
Elbrick. As the elders on the Athen-
ian council Ned Ames and Wendy
Weed draw chuckles from the au-
dience. Robin Wood as the gallant
Spartan General makes us sorry his
part is so small. And to give the
play an up-to-date touch, there is
the Spartan spy Powerclese, (Fran-
cis G.), acted by Brack Dew.

The music in this year’s produc-
tion is much more effective than
in last year’s “Cannon’s Mouth.” The
effective use of a chorus is noted
particularly in the song that opens
the musical “There Are No Men
Left in Athens,” and “Let’s have an
Organized Orgy.” Also interesting is
the chorus “Things Look So Bad”
sung by the women to the tune of
the Volga Boatman with a descant,
a la Leonard Bernstein, sung by
Anne Houghton, Charlotte Turner
and Chris Christie.

Gene Johnson’s orchestra provides
a solid musical background for the
performance. The use of full orches-
tra on some numbers and the piano
rhythms of Ed Maupin on others
makes for interesting contrast and
allowed soloists to be better heard.

The settings based around a series
of marble columns are flexible and
attractive, as is the lighting by Wink
McKinnon.

This is not to say that the show
is perfect. Neither of the songs that
Debbie Doherty sings is very satis-
fying. This is too bad for she has
a powerful voice and could deliver
songs better suited to her voice with
considerable effect. At times the full
chorus scenes tend to seem clumsy,
but this is understandable consid-
ering that many of the chorus mem-
bers are making their first appear-
ance on the stage, and the large size
of the cast negotiating the tiny Troub
stage. These criticisms are slight,
however, when considered against
the play as a whole.

In fact the SWMSFC has positive
insurance for its musical, for how
could a more appropriate theme be
presented on a dance weekend than
“It’s Spring! So let’s make Hay while
the sun shines!!!”

 

College News Commands Spotlight

Congolese at Davidson?

From the Mary Baldwin
Campus Comments

The Board of Trustees at Davidson
College has decided to admit as
many as three qualified students
form the Congo to the Davidson,
N. C., school next year.

These admissions are to be under
Davidson’s regular program for
foreign students and would raise
the maximum number of foreign
students from 16 to 19.

Two years ago the Board of Trus-
tees presented their racial admissions
policy in one terse sentence: “It is
not in the best interests of David-
son College to admit Negroes at this
time.”

The recent action of the trustees
favoring the admission of Congo-
lese students was taken after an in-
quiry from the Board of World Mis-
sions of the Presbyterian Church
and after the student body asked
admittance of colored students to
their college.

The Congolese students will be
recommended by the World Missions
Board and will be subject to the nor-
mal admissions standards. The trus_
tees did not discuss the issue of
admitting American Negro students.

Wharton Makes Changes

Students at the Wharton School
of Finance and Commerce at the
University of Pennsylvania will be-

 

gin taking a heavier dose of liberal
arts courses next year.
Undergraduate business students
there will take only about one-third
of their courses in business, with
the remainder in physical and social
sciences, English, the languages, and
the humanities. Present students at
the Wharton school split their time
half-and-half between strictly busi-
ness courses and outside courses.

Liberal arts courses under the
new program will be taught with
attention to the special needs of
businessmen.

The revisions are the outgrowth of
a study begun in 1954 and represent
an overall broadening of Wharton’s
concept of business education. “Both
the quantity and quality of all
courses are being changed,” Dean
Willis J. Winn pointed out.

United States business schools
have been criticized by business ex-
ecutives, and in reports by the Ford
Foundation and the Carnegie Corp.,
for overemphasizing business and
vocational courses.

Foreign Students Complain

All foreign students who study
at United States colleges and _ uni-
versities may not be returning home
as good friends of this country. In
fact, our current effort to attract
foreigners to U.S. campuses “may
be causing as many headaches as
it’s curing,” the Wall Street Journal
reports.

A fund of $50,000, provided by an
anonymous donor, has been estab-
lished at Washington and Lee to
give scholarship assistance to stu-
dents preparing for medical careers,
President Fred C. Cole has an-
nounced.

Proceeds from the gift will sup-
port a scholarship fund, to be known
as the “J. W. Warner, M.D., Scholar-
ship Fund,” honoring the late Dr.
John W. Warner of Washington,
D.C., who received his undergrad-
uate degree at Washington and Lee
in 1903.

President Cole said the awards
will be given to upperclassmen maj-
oring in pre-medical studies who
possess “those exceptional qualifica-
tions, academic and_ otherwise,
needed to accept the immense re-
sponsibility and challenge of serv-
ing mankind through medicine.” The
amount of financial assistance will
be in accord with an individual’s
need, he added.

A recipient of Warner scholarship
funds may, at his option, be desig-
nated a “J. W. Warner, M.D., Schol-
ar,” President Cole explained. He
said the university expects to award
the first scholarships at the close
of the current semester.

“The importance of encouraging
promising young men to pursue ca-
reers in medicine cannot be over-
emphasized,” President Cole added.
“Recently, there has been a decline
in the number and quality of ap-
plications for admission to medical
colleges. This is due, in part, to the
extraordinary economic sacrifice re-
quired of men pursuing medical
careers. Many of our best students
and potentially our best doctors are,
for reasons beyond their control,
deterred by this prospect and turn
to other fields. Material encourage-
ment should be given to those young
men who elect to pursue this diffi-
cult road of life.”

“We are grateful to the anony-
mous benefactor who is making pos-
sible this expansion of Washington
and Lee’s scholarship resources in
an area of vital importance and in
honor of one of the university’s

Germaine Bree Analyzes
‘Reorientation’ Malraux
Camus, Sartre Sought

By TOM LYBASS

Andre Malraux, Jean-Paul Sartre,
and Albert Camus created a new
“framework of literary reference”
during the 1930’s and 40’s in order
to answer questions pertaining to
the social function of literature, Dr.
Germaine Bree told a duPont Au-
ditorium audience last night.

Dr. Bree, the internationally ac-
claimed critic of modern French
literature, said that Malroux, Sartre,
and Camus raised the “large ques-
tions” posed by all artists, namely
the writer’s place in society, the
significance of literature, the attri-
butes of a valid work of art, and
the nature of the application of the
artist’s principles.

“Proust was the first writer to
probe the problem of the validity
of art,” Dr. Bree said. This “new
and terrible idea” was considered at
length by Malraux, Sartre, and
Camus, but with differences of em-
phasis.

According to Camus, the artist
“lies, or has no purpose, who does
not take into account the suffering
brought about by history.”

“This new sense of the masses
and their suffering added a new di-
mension to the writer’s role, devel-
oping a historical sense which put
an end to the writing of fantasy,”
Dr. Bree explained.

Aware of the wide gap between
the image of man and the historical
reality, these three writers created a
literature of historical explanation
and solution. Each of them for a
time found inspiration in the Marian
ideology.

Because of the alarming aspects
of the twentieth century with its
globel violence, a double role for
the artist developed from the new
historical sense—the artist as a par-
ticipant in action and the artist as
artist.

New Heroes

“The new hero of the novel show-
ed that ideas were not comments on
events but driving forces pushing
man into action,” Dr. Bree said. In
this new role, the artist acquired
sensitivity for human beings.

“This sensitivity involved not
only new substances, but also new
tools, such as theme, vocabulary,
and form,” she said. “The artist
uses these tools most effectively
by withdrawing into solitude.”

“In reviewing the writings of Mal-
raux, Sartre, and Camus as a whole,”
Dr. Bree said, “this one sentence,
taken from the writings of Saint-
Jean Prese, says what these three
writers have moved toward say-
ing: ‘The hour is great and new, and
now, where we discover ourselves’.”

Jamal

Vann Contracts

Night Club Star

By ROGER PAINE

Ahmad Jamal will play here
Saturday for the Spring Dances
concert at 3 p.m. Jim Vann, Dance
Board president, announced the jazz
musician’s signing after several days
of hectic work to obtain a satisfac-
tory piano for Jamal.

The subtle keyboard skill of
Ahmad Jamal, now famous through-
out the fast-growing world of con-
temporary jazz, was first heard with
George Hudson’s orchestra. Ahmad
broke away from that group a few
years later and formed his own
group, known then as Ahmad
Jamal’s Three Strings, and with
this trio he played throughout the
midwest and in New York.

Not ‘Cocktail Artist’

Music is the primary concern of
Ahmad Jamal, and music is what
his trio produces. Many of his fans,
notably Miles Davis, have objected
to accusations that Jamal is “mainly
a cocktail artist.” The force display-
ed by Jamal wherever he plays has
made his an increasingly popular
performer and has sold millions of
records on the Epic label, and later
on Argo, now on Columbia.

“Listen,” says Miles Davis, “to the
way Jamal makes space. He lets it
go so that you can feel the rhythm
section and the rhythm section can
feel you. It’s not crowded.” For
Jamal has, perhaps more than any
other contempory§ artist, made
expert use of the pause in music.
He plays sparely but with intense
dynamics and an incisive knowledge
of how important a period of musi-
cal silence can be if it is made to
work effectively. Jamal has surely
made it work so much so that he
has won in the space of a few short
years a following of millions all
over the world.

One noteworthy appreciation of
Jamal comes from Julian “Cannon-
ball” Adderley, one of Miles Davis’
former sidemen. In a record com-
mentary which appeared in “The
Jazz Review,” Adderley said: “The
whole thing just flows . . . I don’t
think it’s accurate to call Jamal a
‘cocktail pianist’ because I have
to listen to Ahmad. He commands
attention.”

Never Repeats

One of Jamal’s most unique fea-
tures is that he never plays a tune
the same way twice. He has explain-
ed that he keeps finding it possible
to express himself in new ways,
and even after playing a song a
hundred times he still manages to
put something new and different
into its presentation. “It’s true,” he
added, “that after a while, I usually
work out a particular approach to
each tune, but within that frame-
work, I never play it exactly the
same.”

It has been only in the past two
years that Jamal has found him-
self in hot demand throughout the
country. The initial spark of his
success was at the Embers in New
York, when he was using a guitar
instead of drums with his trio. His
real success began when he made
the change to the drums.

Jamal, above all, does not follow
fashion and trends. He is one of the
most controversial of the modern
jazz artists, but even his critics
have fully acknowledged his unique
flair of genius. Bassist Bill Crow
has said: “...his general concep-
tion has an undeniable charm. It is
that almost ingenuous, airy, relaxed
floating charm that serves to iden-
tify Jamal instantly, and that has
been the major factor in his large-
scale acceptance among the jazz
public.”

Being his own worst critic, Ahmad
Jamal is constantly improving and
changing his technique and style.
Because of this and the undeniable
individuality of his personality, both
in life and on the piano, it is cer-
tain that the concert this spring will
| be one of the most memorable in the
' history of the W&L social scene.

The Silly Season

“Spring makes all things young again save man’’—Rich-
ter’s oft-quoted words have never seemed more true to us than
this year. Maybe it’s a reaction against the weatherman’s singu-
lar unwillingness to let the season begin, but Americans seem
recently to have perfected the art of taking the ridiculous ser-

iously.

Witness the recent Fort Lauderdale debacle. Millions of
parents and a large group of college administrators dreamed
of reprisals to come as they grumbled in front of their television
sets with the wind whistling outside. “It’s disgraceful,” they
said with a suitably righteous look. Meanwhile Judge Raymond
A. Doumar, nourished by the more beneficent Florida climate,
chose to release 84 of the 85 miscreants jailed in Fort Lauder-
dale. His tolerance was not repeated when the offending stu-
dents arrived back to their still-frozen campuses.

Meanwhile, our purposeful leaders at Washington and Lee
managed to get worked into a rare dither. Offended liberals
and moderates called for investigations of the John Birch So-

ciety while Barry Goldwater,

the All-American Boy from

Arizona, rose to defend the erstwhile anti-Communists. An-
other All-American Boy, Attorney-General Robert Kennedy,
perhaps luckier because his father has a place at Palm Beach,
refused to worry about the Birchites, calling them “ridiculous,”

which they certainly are.

However, one Peter Breastrup, an intrepid reporter for the
New York Times, saw a pattern in the news. He wrote an article
for Sunday’s Times which places the Birch Society at the base
of all right-wing sentiment in the United States. They are evi-
dently the driving force behind all conservative sentiment in
the United States, a vast league which includes the American
Nazi Party, the National Association of Manufacturers, the
National Review, Barry Goldwater, the American Legion, Wil-
liam F. Buckley, the White Citizen’s Councils, “newly-rich
Texas oilmen,” and the Chamber of Commerce. These “right-
wing extremists’? are special admirers of General Franco and
Chiang Kai-shek. All this with a straight face!

Frankly we’re overwhelmed by it all. But we’ve been too

busy thinking about the start
races to do much about it.

Guideline To U.S. African Policy
Calls For Striking Tough Balance
Among Many Competing Forces

By GEORGE BIRDSONG

Several weeks ago the forces
which form the complex African
situation were presented in a similar
article. One might now ask what our
foreign policy should be in light of
these forces of nationalism, anti-
colonialism, tribalism, Pan-African-
ism, and the problem of the “power
vacuum” and how it will be filled.

First, we must be specific with re-
spect to the policy of anti-colonial-
ism. In the Portuguese colonies of
Angola and Mozambique the govern-
ment must be pressured to expand
opportunities for Africans and pre-
pare them for self-government. A
step in this direction was taken last
week when the U-S. lined up with
USSR, and three Afro-Asian dela-
gations on a resolution calling for
reforms in Angola.

In the past the U.S. has almost
always voted with its NATO allies
on colonial issues. On this question,
however, the U.S. not only split with
Britain and France, but it sharply
challenged Portugal’s attitude of
non-co-operation with the U.N. on
its African territories. Such a policy
was called for in the last ar-
ticle when it was stated that “we
must line up with aspirations of
the African nations or be shut out of
Africa. Thus we must bridge the gap
between pleasing our European al-
lies who have been the colonial
powers and the African states who
are violently anti-colonial.” A step
in the right direction has thus been
made.

Concerning “French” Algeria,
de Gaulle has already given the
option of total independence.
de Gaulle’s a realist and knows this
must be done. All we can do is help
and encourage him to do what he
knows must be done. Moral pressure
should be sufficient.

In Northern and Southern Rho-
desia Britain is trying to do a good,
honest job, and our policy should
encourage them. The Union of South
Africa is perhaps the worst problem
because there appears to be no
change in sight for Vorwoerd’s
racial apartheid policy. We can only
stand against apartheid strongly in
the U.N. and hope that a change
in this policy will come before an
inevitable civil war of blacks against
whites.

Second, we must relate our
strength to Africa’s weakness. Afri-
can colonialism was thus related, but
often without respect to justice. The
U.S. must relate its strength to
Africa through educational, tech-

 

nological, and economic aid always
mindful not to use such aid there
as a goal for political power in it-
self...a very difficult task.

Africa Remains Undecided

Third we must maintain maximum
access to a maximum number of
African states. Some people might
say it is time to choose sides in
Africa and find out which states
are for us and which are against
us. These people say we should make
the Africans choose now between
socialism and private enterprise,
totalitarianism and democracy, and
either be on the side of USSR or the
U.S. These people must realize that
Africa is neither ready nor willing
to make such a choice. Moreover, we
should not even force them into such
a position, because few if any Afri-
can states could make a clear cut
decision on these issues.

We should put out as many hands
as possible in African and be thank-
ful that we have access to these
African states. Futhermore, these
hands should be not only govern-
mental, but also private and individ-
ual efforts We must realize that many
African states want to be neutral
and receive benefits from both sides
as India is doing. Africa is not on
the periphery of Russia and not
necessary to our defense against
the USSR. African neutralism, there-
fore, should be agreeable for us and
we should not even try to line them
up in political alliance.

Fourth, we must recognize that the
African desires the responsibility to
settle his own disputes. We should
not get involved in them if possible.
But if involvment is unavoidable,
we should work through the United
Nations. Even this policy will have
difficulties as is evident by the recent
actions of Congolese leaders (even
“pro-Western” ones such as Kasavu-
bu) revealing their desire to settle
their own matters without U.N. in-
terference.

Perhaps never before has USS.
foreign policy been more important
than it is today, with the whole
African continent at stake. It’s an
immense challenge.

Steve Danzansky: The Way He Works

By ED WEBSTER

Now that the SWMSFC musical,
“Heads or Tails,” is playing nightly
to large audiences, Steve Danzansky
won't be much in evidence. But for
the last eight weeks of grueling re-
hearsals, he’s been the heart of the
show.

He spent the summer writing the
script and doing the music and lyrics
for the songs. (He wrote 20 songs,
is using 14.) His next step was to
assemble a cast and orchestra—a
group of about 150 people.

Having got his raw material to-
gether, he molded it into shape. He’d
shuffle people around on the stage,
and then run to the back of the
theatre and holler, “All right, now
I'm the audience. Take it from Scene
3; let’s see how I like it.”

Occasionally he'd run back up
on the stage to show someone just
what gestures to use. He’d even
simulate applause and laughter to

DitTO

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi
Washington and Lee University,
Lexington, Virginia

Dear Sir:

Your editorial of March 21 on the
Honor System as practiced at
Washington and Lee University in-
vites a response from one who does
not believe in this system and, be-
cause of his interest in your Univer-
sity, would like to see it abolished
at Washington and Lee.

You write, “He who accepts the
benefit of the Honor System is mor-
ally bound to report any suspected
violation. This can in no way be
construed as spying or tale-bearing.
It is the finest expression of loyalty
to a cherished tradition of honor
among a community of self-govern-
ing students.”

The vulnerable heart of the Honor
System is its rule that a student must
report any student he sees cheating.
I strenuously disagree with your
statement that such reporting can-
not be construed as_tale-bearing.
Telling on another is so contrary to
what a boy is brought up to think
of as fair play that one wonders how
the Honor System has ever worked
or can ever hope to work under such
conflicting circumstances. A tattle-
tale has always been looked down
upon, not only by the boys among
themselves but by the teachers of
boys. It has become through custom
a matter of honor not to tell on
another. Which comes first, loyalty
to a system or loyaltiy to a friend?
A man should never be put in the
position of crucifying his friend. Give
the policeman job to an elder, to a
teacher in the classroom, never to a
classmate and friend.

The procedural aspects of the Hon-
or System remind me of the Spanish
Inquisition. Not only do they sound
like it but, from instances brought to
my attention, they are living repli-
cas of it.

Today brings a great challenge to
Washington and Lee. Many believe

 

the Ivy League’s criteria for admis-.

sion to their group of colleges are
unjust. Washington and Lee bene-
fits by accepting young men with
excellent background who are re-
jected by the Ivy League and has
great opportunity to show what can
be made of this first-rate material.

I am sure that all of the young men
of Washington and Lee are getting
a good education but I am also sure
that their education would be even
better without the Honor System.
Eisenhower, Byrd and Nixon are
passe, so is this archaic institution.
I would like to see Washington and
Lee accelerate its maturity and
stride forward to the New Frontier!

“T want to explain what you're
doing here,” he said to them a few
weeks ago. “In a show of this sort,
you must have fun. This is a farce:
every character is a typed character.
There can’t be any subtlety in a
farce.

“You have to exaggerate. You
have got to talk louder. We've seen
the show; we know it can be good.
Now I want you to make it great.”

Steve lives and breathes his show.
His enthusiasm for it is contagious.
When he demands that a line or a
gesture be executed perfectly, the
cast keeps trying until perfection is
reached.

He began work on “Heads or Tails”
early last summer; the “Lysistrata”
theme resulted from a suggestion by
his father.

It is becoming daily more ap-
propriate to remember that one of
the few major differences between
Nixon and Kennedy was on foreign
policy, with Kennedy seeming to
advocate a milder policy toward
the Soviet. Then, as the Laotian
crisis grew worse, Kennedy startled
(and pleased) the world with a firm

 

Steve did research on Greece, and
read several versions of Aristo-
phane’s play. Meanwhile he was tak-
ing music courses at Catholic U.

“To the Greeks,” he says, “the
humor was that women, who were
inferior, would be able to take over
the government.”

To a modern audience, however,
the humor arises from the men’s
loss of “marital privileges.”

The whole idea of the musical,
says Steve, is anti-rational. He is
sympathic to the women’s scheme;
they succeed in defeating the men
who want “heads” to rule.

He also includes a little satire on
current situations. (Come to think
of it, the whole theme is a satire on
the battle of the sexes, a battle which
has changed little since the days of
Aristophanes.)

statement that we would not tolerate
Communist aggression in Laos, and
explained to Americans the probable
disastrous results of a Communist
victory in Laos.

All this was done in a rhetoric

this country had a firm decisive

Siegfred, the pert and proper pres-
ident of the University’s Social
Functions Board, collapsed on his
cot in the fraternity house and began
to cry.

He cried so long and so loud that
he finally woke up his roomie, Elmo,
who was somewhat disturbed be-
cause he had never seen Siegfred
without a smile on his face.

“Anything wrong,  Siegfred?”
ventured Elmo.
| “Alas, woe is me,” wailed Sieg_
‘fred. “I am a failure.”

“Not so,” responded Elmo. “If you,
Siegfred, were a failure, you would
not be a big man on campus as
you are now. No failure could be
Social Functions President and a
member of the honor court at the
same time. Not to mention the ‘good
guy of the year’ award from the
faculty. Why do you think you are
a failure?”

“Because I have failed in a matter
of great importance to the univer-
sity,” sighed Siegfred, wiping away
a tear. “The annual Spring Frolics
week-end is rapidly approaching.
‘The student body will be ready for
!a gala time. And I have failed them
| miserably.”
| “What do you mean?” asked Elmo,

his curiosity whetted by the very
mention of Spring Frolics, called
| by many sources the “most collegiate
' social event in the world.”
“I mean simply this. Guy Lom-
bardo has broken his promise to
| play at Frolics this year. He will
not leave the Roosevelt under any
| condition, not even for the $25,000 I
' worked so hard to raise in order to
lure him to our fair campus. Alack,
alas, where have I failed?”

Siegfred rolled over on his stom-
ach and began crying louder than
ever.

“But Siegfred ...” began Elmo.

“And after I had personally con-
ducted 27 fund-raising drives to
get the money. I wanted so badly to
make this week-end even better than
the Snow Carnival, when we had
that wonderful Dixieland group
everyone was so crazy about.”

“But Siegfred...”

“How disappointed the students
will be in me. All their dreams for
a glorious college-type weekend
shattered. I shall never show my
face on campus again. How callous
Mr. Lombardo must be to hurt so
many.”

“Will you shut your face?” yelled
Elmo.

“Oops, did I interrupt. So sorry,
old boy,” blushed Siegfred.

“Just answer me one question,
Siegfred, old boy. I am a tweedy
dresser, a fair athlete, a procurer of
fine women, the son of a factory
owner. Am I then, or am I not, a
typical red-blooded American col-
lege male.”

“You are indeed,” answered Sieg-
fred.

“Ah, then, as an average college
male, let me clue you in on some,
thing. Nobody but nobody cares
whether you have Guy Lombardo

or not because they’re not going to
the dance anyway. All we want to do
is have a good time, and Guy Lom-
bardo does not fit into our plans at
all.”

“What are you saying?” asked
Siegfred incredulously.

“Just that you can take Guy Lom-
bardo and everything like him and
stick...”

“No, don’t say it,” screamed Sieg-
fred and buried his head under the
pillow.

“Don’t take it so hard, Siegfred,”
laughed Elmo. “It’s been this way
for a long time, only no one ever told
you about it before. We hate dances.”

“No, no, no!” weeped Siegfred.

“Look at it this way, Siegfred,”
continued Elmo. “You have succeed-
ed in accomplishing something
everyone has wanted since 1950. By
failing to get an orchestra, you’ve
knocked out the dances. Take the
money, return it to the students for
use over the week-end. You will be
acclaimed a campus hero. You will
enjoy even greater prestige on cam-
pus, and you will know in your
heart that you alone have made the
student body happy through your
failure.”

“Do you really think so,” asked
Siegfred, beginning to perk up a
bit.

“T know so. You, Siegfred, will be
the biggest man on campus—a hero
in your own times.”

“Then I’ll do it,” shouted Siegfred.
He assumed his normal smile bound-
ed out of the house, leaped on his
tricycle, and fled away in the di-
rection of the faculty social com-
mittee’s office.

“A good afternoon’s’ work,”
yawned Elmo, and returned to the
pad.

 

Notice

Carter Fox, president of the senior
class, announced today that gradu-
ation invitations will not be in until

 

the week before final examinations.

“Gallup Poll.”

In Act I, Powerclese, a Spartan
farmer accused of spying, is a satire
on Francis G. Powers.

The real value of the show,
Steve feels, comes in seeing 150
people, of all backgrounds and in-
terests, “working toward one goal
with no faculty supervision.”

Steve probably has enough talent
and drive to make a career of the-
atrical work. But, he says, “I’ve seen
how those people live. It’s not for
me.”

Instead, he’ll go to law school, and
then practice law.

Fellow students long ago noticed
that Steve has extraordinary powers
of application. Surely the incredible
hours that he has devoted to the
musical, the months of untiring
creativity, and his magnetic enthus-
iasm, seem to indicate that this
fellow has a mental gift that most of
us can envy.

Weakness;

principles.

What has happened since those
dramatic headlines? In news stories
not nearly so blackly bannered, we
read that the formula for peace in
Laos is to be a coalition government.
Presumably this sort of settlement
will also integrate the Pathet Lao
and Kong Le’s forces into the regu-
lar Laotian army.

The history of coalition govern-
ments which have included Com-
munists is unhappy. Czechoslovakia
should have been the last example
we needed of that. A coalition gov-
ernment would seem to be the surest
way of giving Laos to the commun-
ists. But even if the coalition should
work, as soon as the Communists
are sure they’ll not win that way,
the insurrection will begin again,
only more fiercely, for they will
have been able to infiltrate much
deeper into Laos.

In other words, the proposals of
the Kennedy Administration will
just postpone (and not for long) the
Communist take-over in Laos. At
best they will result in renewed war
at a later date (not much later,
though). The practical application
of policy and the soul-stirring an-
nouncements might have come from
two different people for all the re-
lation that they have.

This seems to be the pattern for
the new president: stirring speech
and contrary action. This I suppose,
is what we deserve when we elect a
president on his skill as a debater.

The difficulty is probably that with
Eisenhower we had fumbling policy
combined with utter inability to use
the English language. When Ken-
nedy demonstrated that he spoke
well and clearly, we expected his
policies to be firm and clear, too.
The sophists are in and Socrates is
right.

Another indication of weakness
in Kennedy foreign policy is the de-
cision not to word the Hungarian
resolution so as to annoy the Soviet
Union. While resolutions in the U.N.
are weak things, they give some sort
of indications on how we stand.
Strongly against Portugal; strongly
against South Africa; weakly against
the Soviet Union. Assuming that all
three have acted wrongly why the
difference? It serves our porposes
best not to annoy the bear. It is
expedient.

If expediency is to be the keystone
of our foreign policy vis-a-vis the
Soviet Union, then we are indeed no
better than they. Khrushchev can
talk just as ringingly about justice,
etc., as Kennedy can. The difference
is that the United States is supposed
to act as it speaks.

Hobbs, Way
Star In 9-6 Win

The Washington and Lee Generals
exploded for five runs in the eishth
inning as they blasted Norfolk Wil-
liam and Mary Monday on Smith
Field.

Down 5-4 when they left the field,
the Generals suddenly came to life
at the plate. Second baseman Park
Gilmore led off with a walk, and
pitcher Penn Way beet out a bunt.
Robin Wood fled out, then third
beseman Chuck “The Panther”
Lene sineled to drive in Gilmore
and send Way, to third. Ned Hobbs
followed with another single to
bring in Way, and Bobby Williams
drove Lene home with the third
straight single for the Generals.

Hobbs scored on a wild pitch, and
Roy Carpenter got the fourth single
in a row to score Williams with the
fifth run.

Way, who relieved started Phil
Sharp efter the fifth, faltered in the |
ninth, but Carpenter moved from
first to the mound to preserve the
win. It was Way’s first victory of
the season; his record now stands
at 1-0.

W&L Trackmen Smash East Carolina, 102-37
In Spite Of Cold And Wind Monday

A bracing north wind and a soggy
track gave no quarter to the Gener-
als’ thin-clads yesterday, but they

managed to ride rough-shod over |}
the squad from East Carolina by the|j

lop-sided score of 102 5/6 to 37 1/6.
Depth and more extensive training

gave the Generals a decided ad-'
vantage over the unprepared and od

unsuspecting Carolina team, which
could only place six men in the
16 events.

Coach Norm Lord’s cindermen
managed, on the other hand to
sweep 5 events, the high hurdles,
the 2 mile run, the shot put, the
discus, and the broad jump.

The strong cold wind and soggy |{'

first, but the Generals came back®
for two on Wood’s single, Hobbs’ |
triple to center and Williams’ single.
The Braves scored two in the sec-
ond, and tallied again in the fourth. |
W&L scored in the fifth to bring the |
score to 4-3, and each team tallied
once in the sixth. Then came the
explosive seventh, in which the Gen-
erals sent 10 men to the plate. Nor-
folk scored in the ninth to bring
the final score to 9-6.

The Generals have now won their
last three in a row, and carry a 3-2
record. The Braves are now 8-3. }

Captain Ned Hobbs led the Gen-
erals’ attack, breaking out of a
slump to garner two hits, including
a triple, in three trips. He also
drew a walk, batted in two runs and
scored three himself. Lane and
Williams also had two RBI's.

In the field, Buck Rose made a
spectacular shoestring catch in right
to choke off a Norfolk rally in the
ninth.

The Generals next game will be
with Bridgewater College this Fri-
dey afte afternoon at Bridgewater.

The main attraction at the show
was Sam Huff, the all-pro line-
backer for the New York Giants,
who during the off-season travels
extensively in making personal ap-
pearances. Appearing with Huff
was a host of other personalities
including Cathy Birch “Miss Vir-
ginia of 1960” and “Mr. Fitness,”
Art Levin who has a television
show on Roanoke station WDBJ-
Tv.

Huff officially opened the show
and presented a trophy to the win-
ning band in the pre-opening parade
through the town of Lexington.

The first night’s fare called for a

,modern dance performance by a
group from Sweet Briar College, a

fashion show, a skit by Miss Birch,
'a fitness demonstration and a gym-

nastics demonstration by Mr. and

members of the VMI squad.

The fieldhouse was filled with
booths exhibiting everything from
sports cars to fishing gear and all
were open for inspection by the
huge crowds which attended the
two-day show. Special exhibits in-
cluded the Blue Field Archery
course and a trout fishing pond.

Saturday’s entertainment  sche-
dule included a fly casting exhibition
by Curtis Weaver, a football demon-
stration featuring a former Wash-
_ington and Lee all-Southern quar-
terback, Gil Bocetti; a fencing dem-
onstration by a VMI group, and a
demonstration of skiing techniques

 

by Sepp Kober of the Homestead
and a former Olympic skier.

Other demonstrations included
those in calesthenics, soccer, judo,
basketball, gymnastics, three boxing
matches including that of Robrecht
which was a decision match.

A summation of the whole show
could be found in Sam Huff's first
reaction, “It’s like a county fair.”

Nicholas Nyardi

Dr. Nicholas Nyardi, a director of
the School of International Studies
at Bradley University, will speak
at Washington and Lee Friday, at
10:15 a.m. in duPont auditorium. His
lecture, “Shall We Survive?” will
be drawn from his experience as a
former Hungarian Minister of Fi-
nance. Dr. Nyardi is being presented
by the Lectures Committee of the
University.

Born and educated in Hungary,
Dr. Nyardi has degrees in Political
Science and Law from the Royal
Hungarian University of Budapest.

During World War II Dr. Nyardi
was active in the underground
movement against the Nazis in Hun-
gary. After the war he spent seven
months in Moscow, negotiating a
Russian reparation claim against
Hungary. It was during these con-
ferences that Dr. Nyardi came to

 

Foreign Exchange Students
(Continued from page 1)

The Journal says that many stu-
dents who come here from abroad
have serious financial troubles, which
are not helped any by the greater
affluence of their American class-
mates. The foreigners find it diffi-
cult to obtain a job in the USS.

African students, _ particularly,
complain of racial discrimination
here. Others report that they are
not accepted in college social ac-
tivities. Some schools note a ten-
dency for foreign students to band
together outside of class.

Many colleges find themselves ad-
mitting students who are unpre-
pared, or who are just out for a
good time, because of outside pres-
sure. Inadequate command of Eng-
lish for American lectures is a real
problem.

There are many fine, new univer-
sities in Africa, and the leaders of
Ghana, for one nation, have de-
plored the large percentage of their
ablest students who seek their high-
er education abroad.

Beta Gamma Sigma Initiates Six

Two honorary members and four
student members were initiated into
Washington and Lee’s chapter of
Beta Gamma Sigma Friday in a
ceremony involving an unusual
father-son honor.

Courtney R. Mauzy, vice president
and trust officer of the Charlotte,
N. C., office of the Wachovia Bank
and Trust Company, and Courtney,
Jr., a senior honor student at Wash-
ington and Lee, were honored sim-
ultaneously by the national society
for students of business administra-
tion.

The Mauzy’s profess to a friendly,
intra-family rivalry which stems
from the fact that the father gradu-
ated from the University of Vir-
ginia, while the son chose Wash-
ington and Lee. The rivalry is likely
to continue, for after graduate school

 

at either the University of Virginia
or Cornell, the younger Mauzy will
join the North Carolina National
Bank, a chief competitor of the
father’s bank.

Others honored at Friday’s ini-
tiation were Earl S. Mattingly, treas-
urer of Washington and Lee, and
three students: Stephen H. Paley,
Washington, D.C., Stephen W. Rut-
ledge, Seattle, Washington; and Har-
ry S. Wilbourn, Little Rock, Ark.

Beta Gamma Sigma which has
chapters only in institutions ac-
credited by the American Associa-
tion of Collegiate Schools of Busi-
ness, admits students with out-
standing academic records in busi-
ness studies. Only the upper ten
per cent of a class is eligible. The
fraternity was founded at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin in 1913,

Born in Boston, Mass., he has
spent much of his life traveling. He
has lived in France, Italy, and Japan,
