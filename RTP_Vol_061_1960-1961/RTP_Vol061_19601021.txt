Senator Smathers Lashes At Nixon;
Says The South Will Vote Democratic

People Hungry for Leadership, Reds 90 Miles Away,
Voting Republican Vogue Out of Style””—Smathers

By GEORGE HONTS
Managing Editor

Speaking before 150 ardent Demo-
crats at a luncheon in the Robert E.
Lee Hotel Thursday, Senator George
Smathers of Florida said that the
“People of the U.S. are hungry for
leadership,” and that they are tired
of the lax leadership of the Republi-
can administration.

Sen. Smathers who has campaign-
ed in 32 states for the Kennedy-
Johnson ticket also told the enthu-
siastic audience that he is confident
of a Democratic victory on Novem-
ber eighth. He based his prediction
of victory on the large crowds which
Kennedy has been drawing across
the country. Everywhere, according
to the Florida senator, Kennedy’s
crowds outnumbered Nixon’s by
5,000 to 7,000. And in Jacksonville,
Fla., a supposedly strong conserva-
tive city, Kennedy drew 28,000 list-
eners in the same day Nixon drew
12,000.

Return of the South

Smothers confidently predicted the
return of the solid South to the
Democratic fold. He said that the
people of the South are realizing
that it is in the Democratic party
that they belong. With 15 of 19 im-
portant Senate committee chairman-
ships being held by Southerners
when the Democrats are in power, it
is illogical to vote for a Republican
executive. Sen. Smathers also said
that the vogue to vote Republican as
“the thing to do” is fading, just like
the vogue that made ulcers “the
thing to have.”

Smathers’ contention that the so-
called “Democrats for Nixon” (also
known as “Hyphenated Hybrids” by
former Virginia governor John Bat-
tle) are returning to the party of
their birth. Smathers credited this
trend to Kennedy’s straight forward-
ness in his speeches and the fact that
the Massachusetts senator included
a Southerner on his ticket over the
protests of other groups.

Lashes Nixon

Smathers then lashed out at Nix-
on’s two-tonguedness. He cited the
fact that Nixon told his audience in
Richmond that there was no place
in the Democratic party for the
South. Then he traveled to New
York and told an audience in the

garment district there that the
South’s viewpoint is over-represent-
ed in the Democratic controlled Con-
gress.

Smathers’ praise for Kennedy
drew an ovation from his Lexington
audience. Smathers called Kennedy
a man who could “walk with kings
and never lose the common touch.”
He called him a man of courage and
great intellectual capacity. Combined
with these traits is Kennedy’s tre-
mendous popularity. “He is some-
thing like a cross between Elvis
Presley and FDR,” was Smathers
comment.

Two, Maybe Three

The Senator admitted that two,
possibly three, states in the South
are shaky at this time. He confident-
ly predicts that Florida will go Dem-
ocratic after the wide acclaim that
Kennedy and Johnson received
there. That state has been considered
undecided. The Senator is also op-
timistic about the Old Dominion. He
cited a poll by the Norfolk Ledger
which gave Kennedy 57 per cent to
Nixon’s 42 per cent in Virginia’s sec-*
ond district which was strongly Re-
publican in 1952 and 1956. He also
said that Virginia’s Hyphenated
Hybrids” are coming back to the
Democratic party in droves.

Smathers indicated that the relig-
ious issue was taking its toll in Ok-
lahoma, but that Texas would defi-
nitely go Democratic.

On Cabinet Posts

In a news conference following the
luncheon, Smathers commented on
Kennedy’s position on cabinet posts,
particularly in regards to appoint-
ing a Negro. Ledze’s statements have
been unwaveringly in favor of ap- |
pointing a Negro to a cabinet post.
Kennedy has stated and stands by
his stxtement that he will not pick a
cabinet unti! he is elected, but then
he will chose men who are qualified
regardless of race or other inhibi-
tions, Smathers said.

He also said that President Eisen-
hower had refused to spend the
money eppropriated for defense, and
consequently the defense of the na-
tion had lagged. The Senator was
confident that the American people
had become aware of this lag, and
also that the communists are only

Staunton Host
To Eisenhower

Dwight David Eisenhower, Presi-
dent of the United States, will visit
Staunton next Thursday, Oct. 27, and
will speak at the annual meeting of
the Woodrow Wilson Birthplace
Foundation at the Wilson home.

The President will also be guest
of honor at a luncheon given by the
city of Staunton, the Birthplace
Foundation and Mary Baldwin Col-
lege in the college’s King auditor-
ium. Seven hundred tickets will be
sold at $10 a piece for the luncheon,
and will be issued on a first-come,
first-serve basis. Orders are being
received by the Staunton Chamber
of Commerce.

President Eisenhower is scheduled
to speak from the porch of Mary
Baldwin College—the same spot that
Wilson delivered his address on
“Service” during his homecoming.

Eisenhower is the second chief ex-
ecutive to visit the Wilson shrine.
President Franklin Delano Roose-
velt dedicated the manse in 1941 as
a national shrine. The President has
expressed a desire to visit the birth-
place of his mother near Staunton
on what is locally known as the “Old
Stover Farm.”

Following his speech, President
Eisenhower will fly back to Wash-
ington for a dinner engagement.

 

Notice

A reception for all non-fraternity
students and their parents is to be
given in the Student Union directly
after the football game. Several
members of the faculty and adminis- |
tration are expected to be present.

 

Undersecretary Abbott
Refutes Religious Issue

The Undersecretary of the Inter-
ior said in Lexington yesterday that
the public will have to judge if the
frequent reference to the religious
issue in the 1960 presidential race
“is a planned campaign of anti-
bigotry bigotry.”

George W. Abbott said at a press
conference here that “I am amazed”
that Democratic spokesmen keep
raising the question.

“It ought to have halted a long
time ago,” he said.

Abbott said that he thinks both
Sen. Kennedy and Vice President
Nixon “sincerely mean it” when they
say religion should not be a factor
in the campaign.

He said that he believes the num-
ber of persons who will vote either
for or against Sen. Kennedy solely
because of the Senator's Roman
Catholic religion “is negligible.”

Abbott drove here from Wash- |
ington, D.C., at the invitation of |

tend one of three programs present-
ed by the faculty of Washington and
Lee. Professor O. W. Riegel, chair-
man of the department of journalism
and communications and Dr. Ollin-
ger Crenshaw, professor of history,
will dicuss “Political Campaigning—
Then and Now.” Donald Rhinesmith
will preside over the discussion
which is to take place in Lee Chapel.

A discussion on “Educational Per-
spectives at Home and Abroad,”
will be held by Dr. E. D. Myers,
chairman of the department of phil-
osophy and Dr. Marshall Fishwick,
professor of American studies. This
discussion will take place in New-
comb 8. James Vann will preside.

The third program offered this
evening will be a lecture-painting

Dr. Moses Hadas
To Be October
Seminar Speaker

By NED BROWNING
Staff Reporter

Dr. Moses Hadas, Jay Professor of
Greek at Columbia University, will
be the next Seminar Speaker on Oc-
tober 31.

Dr. Hadas got his A.B. at Emory
University in 1922. He was a student
at the Jewish Theological Seminary
from 1922-26. In 1925 he received his
M.A. from Columbia, and his Ph.D.
in 1930.

Columbia’s Jay Professor of Greek
is the University’s oldest named
professorship. Created in 1830 to
honor the memory of John Jay, first
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
and 1764 graduate of Columbia Col-
lege, the chair was first held by the
noted 19th century classicist, Charles
Anthon.

Dr. Hadas, who succeeds Professor
Kurt von Fritz to become the sixth
holder of the chair in its 126 year
history, has been on the faculty of
Columbia since 1925, with two peri-
ods of absence. In 1928-30 he left to
teach at the University of Cincinnati.

In 1942, Professor Hadas took a
four year leave of absence to serve
with the Officer of Strategie Services
in North Africa and Greece as liaison
officer to the Greek government
forces. After World War II he was
invited to deliver an address to the
Parnassus Club, the leading intel-
lectual society of Greece. Professor
Hadas delivered the address in
Greek.

He is the author of several books,
among which are: “A History of
Greek Literature,” 1950; “Aristeas to
Philocrates,” 1950; “A History of

Only those law students who had
successfully completed one semes-
ter of work in the law school were
eligible for rush at this time. Conse-
quently, the only men rushed were
those students who entered the law
school at mid-term of last year.

The 45 freshmen who began their
law studies this fall will be eligible
for rush next spring.

Those students pledging PAD le-
gal fraternity were: Jim Howe, Dan-
ville, Ky.; Charles Stowe, Phoenix-
ville, Pa.; Andrew ‘Uncas’ McThen-
ia, Alderson, W. Va.; and John

Brass Choir Makes Debut;
To Appear with Glee Club

The John A. Graham Brass Choir
will make its 1960-61 debut this Sat-
urday night in Doremus Gymnasium.
Appearing with the Brass Choir will
be the Washington and Lee Glee
Club, and both organizations will
present a program for visiting par-
ents.

This year’s brass choir includes
two new trumpet players who are
Eric Wilson, a freshman from Scars-
dale, N. Y., and Kenneth Everett, a
freshman from Bastrop, La. Wilson
played also cornet his senior year
in the Scarsdale High School Band.
Everett played solo cornet his en-
tire 4 years at Bastrop High School.

Numbers that will be featured
this Saturday night include “Can-
zona No. 455” by Gabrieli, “Music for

 

*first year of the fund’s application.

Three Purposes

As established by the Univer-
sity’s Board of Trustees, the Robert
E. Lee Research Fund will serve
three basic purposes, President Cole
said. They include:

1) Promoting faculty research
activities in which promising un-
dergraduates may take part as re-
search assistants or apprentices.

2) Establishing research assist-
antships or apprentices for prom-
ising and interested undergradu-
ates for work during the school
year and during the summer
months.

3) Encouraging faculty and stu-
dent participation in interdisciplin-
ary seminars on research tech-
niques, tools, and methodology.

“It is our belief at Washington
and Lee that we should make every
effort to introduce our students to
the intellectual stimulation of re-
search and investigative study at the
earliest possible time in their aca-
demic careers,” President Cole said.
“We hope such work on the under-
graduate level will result in greater
numbers of our students going on to
graduate schools and advanced de-
grees, and also for those who will
not continue in graduate school we
feel there are basic intrinsic benefits
in such experience.”

All Disciplines

President Cole said all academic
disciplines——including physical and
natural sciences, humanities, and
social sciences,—will share in the re-
search fund’s application.

Under present plans, academic
credit will not be given to students
taking part in the program, but
President Cole said participation
would contribute greatly to a stu-
dent’s general education.

“Through their stipends as re-
search assistants and  appren-
tices, students will have an oppor-
tunity to earn a portion of the costs
of their education in a way that will
be more meaningful to them than the
experiences of the usual part-time
jobs on and off campus,” President
Cole declared.

15 Projects

Some 15 research projects involv-
ing the use of student assistants
have been submitted by Washington
and Lee faculty members for consid-
eration. President Cole said appro-
priate officials will review projects
and recommend approval for neces-
sary funds.

President Cole said he hoped the
Robert E. Lee Research Fund would
help bring about a closer relation-
ship between the university func-
tions of teaching and research.

“Particularly in an institution such
as Washington and Lee, faculty re-
search should bear the closest rela-
tionship possible to the improvement
of teaching and the advancement of
understanding and learning for our
students,” President Cole said.

Marine Visits

Captain Rodgers T. Smith, Marine
Corps Selection Officer, will be on
the Washington and Lee campus for
the first time this first semester, next
Thursday afternoon.

Captain Smith will discuss the
various Marine Corps Officer Train-
ing programs, all of which permit the
individual to graduate from college
and thereafter fulfill his military ob-
ligation as a lieutenant in the Mar-
ine Corps Reserve.

Freshmen and sophomores com-
plete the required twelve weeks’
training during the summer months
through the Platoon Leaders Class.

Qualified seniors may participate
in ten weeks of precomissioning
training following graduation, if ac-
cepted for the Officer Candidate
Course or Aviation Officer Candidate
Course.

Che Ring-tum Phi

Sen. John F. Kennedy For President

The Friday Edition of the
Ring-tum Phi would like to go
on record as supporting the
candidacy of Senator John
Fitzgerald Kennedy for the of-
fice of President of the United
States.

To qualify our endorsement
we choose to comment on the
following issues of the cam-
paign: foreign affairs, domestic
policy, civil rights, and the “‘re-
ligious issue.”

Putting aside the fabricated
issue of experience (for Sen.
Kennedy has served in govern-
ment as long as Nixon but in a
different capacity) although
there are comments to be made
on both sides, both candidates
agree on the goals or ends in foreign affairs—it is just in the
area of means for attaining these goals that they differ.

 

Se
Sen, John F. Kennedy

This can be dramatically pointed out in the approach that
Nixon and Kennedy took on the offshore islands of Quemoy
and Matsu. Senator Kennedy would be the first person to
admit that containing, and, where possible, eliminating, com-
munism is the overall policy of the United States. The essen-
tial difference in the candidates’ approaches is that Nixon in
his affluent (yet folksy) way would commit the United States
on specific matters without considering the other aspects of his
action. As Sen. Kennedy has pointed out, we are treaty-bound
to meet our obligations in Formosa and the Pescadores, but
the off-shore islands are not included in that treaty and be-
cause of this we can meet our commitments without jeopardiz-
ing American lives over a political issue.

He has explained that through these bickerings the United

Well Done, Generals

We are proud of our football team, its coaches and its rec-
ord. For years now editorials and columns of this newspaper
have approached Washington and Lee varsity athletics in
moods reflecting concern, indignation, regret, apathy, and
often, mere toleration.

Although we, as a student body, seemed to meet the non-
subsidization crisis with protest, we eventually surrendered to
an incomplete, unsatisfying system which surpressed the one-
time glamour and predominance of intercollegiate athletics.
While suffering the sting and embarassment of countless de-
feats, we questioned whether such a program would ever achieve
contemporary standards.

Over the past four years, a movement, or “exodus,” from
our supposed plight has been maturing. Through diligence and
acceptance of things as they are, several men are approaching
their goal. They are turning a psychological liability into a
material asset. No longer are athletic teams paid for—they are
made. Our track and swimming teams were undefeated last
season. Our football team is compiling a record of wins, and
according to the information office, “if W&L can pull it off, a
victory Saturday will (1) assure the Generals’ of their first win-
ning season since 1951 when holdovers from the ’Gator Bowl
team posted a 6-4 mark; (2) give McLaughlin his first winning
year asa college coach; and (3) provide the Generals with their
longest winning streak (six, including the 1959 finale) since
1914-15.”

We congratulate all those who have shared the dream that
Washington and Lee can fulfill its athletic goals in a manner
more conducive to academic excellence.

Welcome Parents

We would like to extend a cordial welcome to all of the
parents and relatives visiting Washington and Lee students. We
hope that your stay in Lexington will be rewarding.

We would hope that students will cooperate with univer-

sity officials in making the sixth annual Parents’ Weekend a |
success. Perhaps the student’s most important duty is to en- |

courage his parents to attend the events planned so that they
may gain a better knowledge of W&L.

The university has done its part in planning a weekend
filled with discussions, activities, and social functions. From
participation in these, our parents will leave W&L with a better
concept of student life.

 

No “Sudden Death” Quiz and No Law Suit

I'd met my date before or not. We
had had a rather beery pig party at
the house on the previous Saturday,
but from her first “oink” on, I knew
who she was. I still can’t figure out
how the Abominable Snowman got
out of the Himalayas without being
shot!

Somewhat grudgingly I got into
the back seat of the car and quietly
contemplated suicide. The monotony
of it all was crushed when we stop-
ped at the College Inn to pick up a

who suggested going to Sem on

theaters’ libel suit against me
wasn’t being pressed, and my “pop”

rialize, I twisted my own arm and
talked myself into making the short,
but treacherous road trip to Buena
Vista. (They’ve got a swell police
force in B.V. too.)

Actually, I couldn’t remember if

 

(Continued on page 4)

States has focused attention on an area that should have been
left alone. As Sen. Smathers pointed out yesterday, ‘Dick
Nixon has the same military experience as Sen. Kennedy and
myself. But on a tactical matter such as the off-shore islands
he should have confidence in the military discretion of those
more fully acquainted with the area, specifically the military
command.” Kennedy, however, when the president endorsed
Nixon’s plan, held that since the issue has become the policy
of the present administration, we should uphold it. Before be-
coming policy, this plan was a dangerous instrument. Because
it was political taffy, Vice President Nixon planned to pull with-
out eating. We were not prepared at the time of the original
statement to tactically meet and strategically fortify ‘this am-
biguity in foreign policy. It is of far greater concern for
Americans to recognize the disaster in Cuba, just 90 miles from
Florida, than to risk intervention in an area to which so much
nebulous foreign diplomacy is attached.

Senator Kennedy is a realist in domestic affairs, and not in
an effort to shock, but to arouse, does he cite the characteristics
of a static America. The unrealized steel capacity, the farm
problem, and other such cancers plight our nation. Kennedy
recognizes these problems and advocates a program that will
relieve the present situation. Bound by his loyalties, the vice
president says that America is as good as always, and better than
than ever. These loyalties will not cease to exist after January.
But for Senator Kennedy, America can only achieve inter-
national prestige by becoming sound nationally. Currently, our
image abroad reflects our internal disorder.

Of great concern to the South is the issue on Civil Rights.
This has been an issue before. As reflected by their platforms
both parties agree on the ends; but, as illustrated by their ap-
proaches, they do not, again, agree on means. Votes or not,
Democratic candidates do not believe in, nor would make a simi-
lar statement to that of Republican Henry Cabot Lodge in
Harlem. Nor would a Democratic president have sent troops
into Little Rock. Statistically and traditionally the best interests

of the southern states have been best served by Democratic
administrations, and this policy will continue to flourish if John
Kennedy is elected. Lyndon Johnson represents the fervor of
the southern ideal—Virginia and Florida, as well as other bord-
er states, vigorously supported him at the convention, and will
continue to do so on November 8. The South sees in Johnson
a strong representative of her interests, and in Kennedy a per-
son cognizant of her needs.

There is no religious issue in this campaign. The candidates
do not debate about it, nor do they condone it. John Kennedy
washed his hands of the matter in his acceptance speech, at
San Francisco and has not sought to propagate it—only to dis-
pell it. There only remains the bigotry which seeks to deny the
office of president to a man only because he was christened in
his youth and holds the tenets of a religious faith. The im-
portant thing is that he worships God, and as Sen. Smathers
said, can cherish this ideal to the destruction of its opposite,
communism.

Sen. Kennedy is an advocate of progressive reform. He has
stated on numerous occasions that this reform will not be
realized without sacrifice. We feel that an analogy can be drawn
between the progress that Jack Kennedy knows is vital and nec-
essary and the progress that any university community, such
as Washington and Lee, anticipates. Both are promoted through
sound judgment and an understanding of the needs in those
areas under consideration; both have a goal—be it national
or academic excellence; and both are dedicated to the removal
of derelection of any form. If we are cognizant of both of
these ideals and pay lip service to neither, we are more apt to se-
cure both the blessings of liberty and the fruits of a good edu-
cation. On the other hand, if we become smug and self-satis-
fied with the ever-available status quo, and settle down amid
a guise of conservatism, then we cannot expect our institution
(nation or university) to meet the requirements of survival in
an age which enjoys constant and considerable flux.

It is therefore in good conscience that we endorse Senator

 

Kennedy’s candidacy.

 

 

Nixon Fumbles Issues with Lack of Candor;
Foreign Policy, Topic of Friday Columnist

By ROBERT C. KETCHAM
Friday Columnist

Tonight the moroniscope will car-
ry the last of the great debates in this
campaign. There will presumably be
talk of the off-shore islands, Cuba,
and the problem of American pres-
tige.

The issue of prestige, of our rela-
tive power and influence, is the ov-
erriding and most important issue,
but a difficult one to explain and an
easy matter to obfuscate. The dis-
heartening thing to this writer is the
manner in which it is refuted by
the Republicans. They accuse the
Democratic candidates of gloom and
fear, saying it is wrong to talk of
this country’s faults and deficiencies.

This kind of refutation cuts to the
very nerve of our dilemma, and is
the thinking which conforms to what
I would call the mal due siecle. In
America we are not supposed to be
unhappy or to feel a need for sacri-
fice—this goes against the trend of
our prosperous society. We find se-
curity in believing that the country
is well and that all others alike think
that this is so.

We are, in effect, the victims of our
own doing, of things and circum-

 

stances which we have created.
Americans lose sleep over health,
money and family problems, but
they do not lose sleep about the
problem of society. To think of the
weighty matters of state is for oth-
ers—we cannot see its effects today
they say, so why worry. Mr. Nix-
on and Mr. Lodge can pretend that
there is no problem of American
prestige, they can continue to talk
down to the voter and leave them to
wallow in complacency. But unless
we know the truth of our situation—
where we are—we cannot know
where to go, or how to get there.

From the past we have the slogan,
“politics in America should stop at
the water’s edge.” That policy is not
feasible today with our involvement
and concern as a nation in world af-
fairs; however, ad libbing under the
lights as to future policy in this field
presents much danger. It might make
for a good show to talk of what one
would do with the off-shore islands
if elected President, but it is not
very realistic in the glare of the TV.

Our position as to the off-shore
islands has remained ambiguous un-
der the present administration, and
that, in itself, is good. We do not

want to give Chiang any more of a
blank check by what we say now.
The issue is confused, too, at this
moment; Mr. Kennedy having stat-
ed and restated that he favors the
present position while Mr. Nixon ex-
tended his policy under the “princi-
ple” doctrine, but is now endorsed by
Eisenhower which takes him back to
the similar position of Kennedy.

Technically Mr. Kennedy is cor-
rect. There is no specific commitment
to defend the Quemoys and Matsus;
and a long list of military authori-
ties have said they were not essen-
tial to the defense of Taiwan. How-
ever, the fact remains that the old
way of tedious negotiations, of which
our allies would be a part, will be
the method of changing our com-
mitments and to talk further or push
this argument any more would be
absurd.

Cuba, A Vital Concern

Cuba is a vital matter of concern
today; especially since Latin Ameri-
ca is becoming the greatest battle-
ground of the cold war. Even after
Castro’s revolution, Mr. Nixon was
assuring the American people that
“the Cuban people themselves will

 

not tolerate a Communist govern-

 

ment or a Communist takeover.” Re-
gardless of this assurance, it is so.
Our diplomats hide behind the doc-
trine of non-intervention and have
achieved a spectacular diplomatic
defeat. Nor can we fully realize its
repercussions today. With half the
world struggling for improvement we
cannot maintain such a policy. With
“friendly revolutions” in several
Latin American countries, noticeably
Guatemala, we might wonder
what kind of money and what kind
of brains are behind us.

We cannot afford a fumbling with
the issues, a lack of candor or a
failure of foresight. I do not contend
that our administration is responsi-
ble for all difficulties in the present
world. Nevertheless the administra-
tion is responsible for failing to real-
ize and meet the challenge in tech-
nology and production, it is respon-
sible for having not achieved a for-
eign policy to recognize the new
balance of power, with the neutral
block of nations and the more formi-
dable Communist powers; and for a
foreign policy that is defensive and
lacks initiative. It must answer with
more than “you are downgrading
America.”

 

U, pperclassmen Lack Respect For Dormitory Rules

By MALCOLM BROWNLEE
Friday Columnist

It is midnight in the freshman
dorm. Some of the freshmen are al-
ready in bed and others are quietly
studying. A few bull sessions are
going on behind closed doors. In
room 291 a dorm counselor is getting
ready for bed. He marvels at how
quiet things are, turns off the lights
and lies down for a peaceful night’s
rest.

Suddenly the stillness of the night
is torn apart by a shrill cry from the
hall outside the counselor’s room.
“No, not tonight,” cames the cry;
“please, not tonight, Bill.”

The counselor lies still and hopes
that this unwelcome noise will go
away. But he hopes in vain. He hears
doors opening up and down the hall,
and the clamor of voices is added to

 

the original. Slowly he crawls out
of bed, turns on a light and blinks
a few times adjusting his eyes to the
light. He opens the door and walks
into the hall.

A crowd of freshmen has gath-
ered around the staircase and is
shouting at something that he can-
not see. He pushes his way through
the crowd and tells the freshmen to
return to their rooms. Some do.
Then he sees the cause of the con-
fusion.

Two upperclassmen have hold of
a freshman’s arms and are dragging
him down the stairs. The freshman
is trying to resist but is not very
successful. “Please, Bill,” he whines,
“I don’t want to go, not tonight.”

“Let’s quiet it down, fellows,” says
the counselor. He wishes he could
say more but he does not know ex-

 

actly what to say. He watches the
upperclassmen let go of the fresh-
man and silently and unforcefully
continue down the stairs with him
and out the door.

The above is a type of scene which
occurs far too often. During the first
semester of each year, the freshman
dorm counselor have almost as
much trouble with disturbances from
the upperclassmen as with disturb-
ances caused by freshmen. A stu-
dent who has graduated from the
freshman class seems to think that
he is no longer subject to dormitory
rules.

Sometimes excessive noise arises
when an upperclassman who is
merely talking to a freshman fails
to show courtesy to others in the
dormitory. More often, however, the
noise is created by an upperclass-
man who is trying to take a pledge

 

to his fraternity house.

Fraternity raids on the pledge
classes in the dorm have become a
tradition which in the minds of some
takes precedence over dormitory or-
der. Some upperclassmen seem to
believe that a dorm counselor has
no right to prevent them from do-
ing what they want to their pledges.

This attitude must be changed. All
students should realize that dormi-
tory order depends on all who are
in the dormitory, and this includes
upperclassmen as well as freshmen.

The use of physical force in order
to drag a pledge to his house seems
to me a somewhat primitive as well
as an awkward way to accomplish
this purpose. Social pressures should
be much more effective, and social
pressures cause far less noise.

Raids on the dormitory, however,

Hickey
Set To Go
Saturday

Halfback Jim Hickey, a 9.9 man in
the 100-yard dash who scored 40
points for the Generals in 1959,
should be ready for unlimited duty
tomorrow for the first time this sea-
son.

Hickey, who has been sidelined
with an injured knee, has made only
three appearances in W&L’s first
four games.

Last week against Randolph-
Macon, the speedy halfback dem-
onstrated his 1959 form when he
scored a touchdown on his only
play of the game. Taking a delayed
swing pass from quarterback Steve
Suttle, the speedster raced 39-
yards for the final W&L TD.

Jim’s scoring play against the
Jackets reminded fans of 1959 when
Hickey scored three touchdowns in
the Generals’ 33-33 tie with R-M.

“That play did more to cure Jim’s
knee than all the treatment we could
give him in a year,” Coach Lee Mc-
Laughlin said. “I think he’s ready
to be a big help to us now. He'll give
us that extra burst of speed neces-
sary to turn the corner that we
haven’t displayed so far.”

Last year the 5-9, 160-pound jun-
ior from South Boston, Virginia,
paced the team in yards per carry
with a 4.6 mark. His total rushing
yardage of 208 was third best.

Hickey also was the squad’s lead-
ing pass receiver, snaring 13 passes
good for 256 yards and two touch-
downs.

The return of Hickey to the Gen-
erals’ lineup for the Johns Hopkins
game may give the Generals the ad-
ded punch they need to win their
sixth game in a row.

Underdog Generals’ Bite

Threatens Jay Win String

Underdog. |

Yes, underdog, a word familiar to |
W&L teams of the past six years, |
will make its first appearance on the |
Washington and Lee scene this year
tomorrow at 2 p.m.

Tomorrow the Five-Star Gener- |
als, who are currently riding a
five-game win streak (including
the last game of the 1959 season),
collide with Johns Hopkins’ unde-
feated grid machine at Wilson
Field. |

defense is still the weakest spot in
W&L’s defensive armour.

Johns Hopkins’ double-wing of-
fense is important because the
Generals haven’t faced this type
of offense yet this season.

“We may find it hard to adjust to

1

their double wing,” McLaughlin said.
“They use their fullbacks (Harry
Leet and Phil Sutley) very well
for ground power and their tailbacks
| (Henry Ciccarone and Joe Cioni)
are good passers, as good as any
we've faced.”

On the W&L side of the ledger

 

 

 

   

s

Johns Hopkins has snatched the, = ee

favorite’s role, but the Generals are |
hungry for their sixth win in a row— |
a feat a W&L football team has not
accomplished since 1914-15.

W&L Coach Lee McLaughlin,
kanxious to be cast as the underdog
in tomorrow’s encounter, said, “We’ll
be facing our toughest opponent yet,
and if we win, it'll have to go as an
upset.”

To back up his assertions Mc-
Laughlin cited the Jays’ 7-1 record
last year, their Middle Atlantic and
Mason-Dixon Conference champion-
ships, and their unscarred record this
year.

The Jays have two more advan-
tages on their side: a good passing
attack and their double wing of-
fense,

A good passing attack is advantag-
eous because of W&L’s supposedly
weak pass defense.

The Generals’ pass defense is im-
proving every game (in the past two
games the alert defense has picked

 

off ten opponent passes), but pass

 

Wednesday afternoon proved to be
a black day for the Generals as the
Varsity soccer team was handed its
second straight defeat. The North
Carolina “Tarheels” routed W&L
4-0 in a one-sided scoring tilt.

What was thought to be a toss up
contest before game time proved to
be an almost one-sided affair by the
time the final gun was sounded.

North Carolina scoring attack was
spread over the first three quarters,
and only chance prevented them
from tallying in the final period.

The Tarheels jumped off to a 1-0
lead mid-way in the first period off
a deflected kick which rebounded
off W&L’s left halfback and past
goalie Clark Valentiner.

The second tally came in the sec-
ond period as a result of a well
placed corner kick which was turned
into a point by the U.N.C. forward
line.

 

Co-captain Frank Smith drives past a North Carolina defender in the

 

second period of Wednesday’s contest. Frank later suffered a severe

shoulder separation.

The final scoring took place in the
third period as the Carolina center
forward accounted for two goals, off
well placed shots from close to the
nets.

Although the 4-0 score doesn’t in-
dicate it—the Generals palyed ag-
gressive ball throughout the con-
test. Center forward Dave Knight
deserves credit probably as being the
game’s outstanding player for the
Generals. Dave turned in a fiery per-
formance although bothered severly
by a bad ankle.

there are three factors: depth, re-
venge, and desire.

McLaughlin alternates three
complete units throughout the
game and wild-cards other play-
ers at crucial moments. This three-
team depth has been one of the
main factors in the Generals’ 4-0
record this year.

As for revenge, Johns Hopkins

' tackled W&L in 1957, McLaughlin’s @

first year as head coach here, and

first winning season since 1951;
to give Coach McLaughlin his first
winning year as a college coach;
and to chalk up a six-game victory
string—the first since 1914-15.

Only Common Foe

The only common foe that W&L
and Johns Hopkins have met is
Franklin and Marshall. The Jays
edged F&M, 12-6, the week before
the Generals battered the Pennsyl-
vania crew, 38-8.

“That comparison doesn’t mean a
thing,” McLaughlin quickly pointed
out. “We got the jump on F&M,
that’s all.”

Statistically the Generals go into
tomorrow’s contest with a total of-
fensive average of 377 yards per
game and have allowed their op-
ponents only 170 yards per game.

Pint-sized fullback Doug Martin
heads the W&L rushers with 381
yards in 48 carries—a remarkable 7.9
yards per carry.

Funkhouser with 200 yards is sec- |
ond. Steve Suttle with 142 yards is
third and Tommy Keesee with 106
yards is fourth.

Freshman J. Baker Wins

Fall Tennis Tournament

The 1960 Fall Tennis Tournament’s
new champion is John Baker, an
SAE pledge. Baker defeated Jerry
Wilbourn, a senior, 6-0, 6-2.

The result was a direct reversal
of last year’s tournament final, in
which a senior defeated a freshman.

The match included many long
volleys and was a fitting climax to
a hard fought tournament. The one
sided score was not indicative of the
match. Baker himself remarked that
it might have gone either way.

He received the Thomas, Ltd.,
Trophy, presented annually to the
winner of the tournament. Baker is
the second ranked amateur in the
state and should prove to be a valu-
able addition to W&L’s fine tennis
team.

Sen. Smathers Lashes At Nixon;

(Continued from page 1)
90 miles away, in Cuba. He expressed
confidence that they would elect an
administration with a positive pro-
gram—namely, the Democratic one.

When asked how he knew Cas-
tro was communistic, Smathers re-
plied that he had been running
with the Reds since 1949. In 1954,
the bearded wonder was connected
with the Reds in Guatemala and he
has been associated with various
pink or red groups in university
activities.

On the Cuban question, Smathers
said that the people of his state were
concerned over the situation there.
They, and many other Americans,
fear the possibility of a Soviet mis-
sile base on the island. Also, he said,
many Americans are aware of com-
munist inroads in other Latin
American countries. For these rea-
sons, Smathers said the people of
America are hungry for leadership.

Battle Speaks

William Battle, son of the former
governor, and campaign chief for
Virginia, also addressed the lunch-
eon audience, predicting the large
ground swell for Kennedy in Vir-
ginia would continue to grow until
Virginia returned to the party of
Jefferson and Sen. Harry Byrd.

Last year, Time said: “Dr. Hadas
is a rare phenomenon—the great

former rabbi, German scholar, and
OSS agent, he leads a class with the
mixed sensitivity and audacity of an
impassioned symphony conductor.
His white beard electric with energy,
his slender, tapered fingers clutch-
ing for some bit of wisdom from the

Dorm Rules Disregarded

(Continued from page 2)

have become far more than just a
means of getting pledges to the
house. It is for many a game similar
to the childhood games of Cowboys
and Indians and Cops and Robbers.
The freshman seeks to avoid the ter-
rifying upperclassman and may even
hide out in someone else’s room in
order to do so. The upperclassman
searches diligently in order to find
the freshman which he can bring
to his idea of the straight and
narrow.

Such games can be fine if they
are played quietly or in other places
than the freshman dorm. The dorm
however is no place for excessive
noise or rowdy behavior. Most fra-
ternities have already found better
methods to get their pledges to their
houses. Those who cannot get con-
trol of their pledges without exces-
sive racket or physical force or both
also must find more effective and less
disorderly methods.

Nixon were advanced to the Senate
and Kennedy defeated Henry Cabot
Lodge two years later to join his
compatriots.

From this long association with
Kennedy, Smathers said, he had
come to greatly admire him for his
intellectual capacity and ability in
office.

People everywhere are looking to
Kennedy with hope, the Senator said
in concluding. A poll of people of
other nations, made by the Republi-
cans, show that people everywhere
now consider the Soviet Union to be
the nation with a future. In every
case, Smathers said, American pres-
tige has dropped and we are no long-

Three Evening Programs

Begin Parents’ Weekend

Churches in the Lexington area
invite the parents to attend Sunday
services with their sons. Several
churches have planned programs for
the Weekend to follow the morning
worship service.

Parents’ Weekend is under the
sponsorship of the university and the
Parents’ Advisory Council, a 56
member body whose special interest
in Washington and Lee affords an
effective means of communication
between parents and the university.

The purpose of the weekend is to
provide parents with an opportunity
to visit the campus, meet with mem-
bers of the faculty and hear reports
from university and student body
officials.

James W. Whitehead, assistant to
the president for administration
heads arrangements for the program.
