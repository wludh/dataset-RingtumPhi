Conventional Dress Not Required

Conventional Dress will not be
required for this afternoon concert,
dance officials said today.

The Dance Board informed the

Bermudas and sports shirts will be
considered respectable, a spokesman
said.

There will be no drinking of any

spokesman said, and no cups will
be allowed. Violators of this rule,
he said, will be subject to admin-
istrative action.

Pat Dorn, and his orchestra, a
popular group in the East, will sup-

One of the highlights for Dorn’s
group came from a recent college
tour. At Yale University, he and
his orchestra accompanied singer
Roy Hamilton.

Concert Has Jimmy Reed

Jimmy Reed, a nationally known
rock and roll artist, will headline
the concert tomorrow. Reed ranks
among the all-time recording greats
in folk, rhythm and blues, and jazz.
He is recognized as one of the na-
tion’s top guitarists and singers. He
has consistently hit the “Top Twenty
Nationally” charts with each of his
records. His recent hits include
Found Love, You Got Me Dizzy,
Going to Virginia, and Caress Me.

Commenting on the appearance of
Jimmy Reed, Dance Board Presi-

-|dent Jimmy Vann said, “Contract-

Mr. Ford said the gift would help
preserve one of the South’s most
prized landmarks, and is regarded
by the Fund as a contribution to
the Civil War Centennial observ-
ance now in progress throughout the
United States.

“Our trustees believe it to be most
important to maintain the Lee
Chapel as a priceless spiritual and
historic possession for the South
and for the nation,” he said.

Dr. Fred C. Cole, president of
Washington and Lee University,
said:

“Washington and Lee is indeed
grateful to the Ford Motor Com-
pany Fund for enabling this univer-
sity to continue to fulfill its trust
to preserve and maintain such a
place of historical value and charm.
Because the University’s first com-
mitment is to education, it would be
most difficult in the near future to
provide sufficient funds from the
normal endowment resources for the
restoration of the chapel.

Gift Important

“I know everyone interested in
the heritage of this country is also
grateful that the Ford Motor Com-
pany Fund will support this impor-
tant undertaking in such generous
fashion. This gift will certainly rank
as one of the most important and
timely ever received by Washington
and Lee University.

The $370,000 contribution will be
presented to the University during
commencement exercises at the Lex-
inton campus June 2,

Ford Motor Company Gives $370,000
To Restore W&L's Famed Chapel

Washington and Lee University’s famous Lee Chapel will
be restored with a gift of $370,000 from the Ford Motor Com-
pany Fund, it was announced earlier this week.

Henry Ford, president of the fund, said that the contri-

bution will be made to Washington and Lee for restoration of
Lee Chapel located on the campus.*

 

mediately on plans for the restora-
tion. The actual work of restoring
the building will require about 18
months, he added.

More than 30,000 persons visit the
Lee Chapel annually. Dr. Cole said
the structure will remain open to
the public while restoration work is
under way.

Gen. Robert E. Lee commander-
in-chief of the Confederate Army
during the Civil War built the fa-
mous chapel while serving as presi-
dent of the University from 1865
to 1870.

The Lee Chapel stands today
much as it did in General Lee’s time
except for an extension to the rear
of the building to provide space for
Edward Valentine’s famous Recum-
bent Statute of Lee.

Is Now Museum

It houses a museum of Lee battle-
field and family memorabilia and an
art collection with many valuable
paintings, including original por-
traits of George Washington, James
Madison, General La Fayette and
several of Lee. Adjacent to the mu-
seum is Lee’s office unchanged from
the time of his death in Lexington
on October 12, 1870. The general and
members of his family are buried
in the chapel.

Over the years, the building has
deteriorated. Wooden trusses sup-
porting the slate roof have sagged
and side walls bulge. Utilities need
modernizing and extensive other
work and repairs are needed.

The Ford Motor Company Fund is
a non-profit corporation operated for
scientific, charitable and educational
purposes ,and is financed by contri-
butions from Ford Motor Company.

’38 and is the highest ranking grad-
uate of the W&L ROTC program,
receiving his rank of Colonel in
January of 1958. While at Washing-
ton and Lee he was a member of
Sigma Nu fraternity and Omicron
Delta Kappa.

Assuming the command of the
Ist Battle Group, 13th Infantry, in
January of 1959, at Sandhofen,
Germany, Col. Anderson has led a
varied and diversified career in the
U.S. Army.

During World War II he was with
the 93rd Infantry Division as G-1
and G-3, serving in the Solomon
Islands and New Guniea. He was
later assigned to the G-3 section,

Washington and Lee In Retrospect

Four years, though a relatively small segment of time, af-
fords one a degree of perspective with which to analyze, criticize
and compliment. Goals and gains, progress and potential, as
well as error, neglect and weakness can be better assessed over
such a span. In a real sense, it usually takes a person four years
to approach an understanding of and appreciation for the arti-
ficiality of a university environment and its resulting advantages.

Washington and Lee, as we say so often, has acquired a
new vitality in leadership and the progressive reform resulting
from this so-called ‘‘new era” is a constant source for our praise
and gratitude. But above all the shouts for the future and prog-
ress, I feel the strength of Washington and Lee does not lie in
its promise, but in its past.

Academic excellence has always been a goal of this universi-
ty and as it is presently reflected in a dedicated faculty and an
inquisitive student body such excellence will not be an inno-
vation, but a continuance. This is not to say that new concepts,
methods and ideas do not find fruition at Washington and Lee,
but only that there is and has been existent here a cultivated
tradition into which the new and different are assimilated. With
the promise of curricula re-vitalization and other such means
of improving upon the traditional, our education becomes a
dichotomy in concept—the wisdom of the old blended with
the strength and promise of the new.

Our editorials over the course of this academic year have
been concerned, for the most part, with problems as well as
progress, and I would like to end these efforts with this same
combination. My criticism is informed by a strong sense of de-
votion to the ideals of this university and the principles of a
liberal arts education.

“protest”

Fortunately, or unfortunately, as the case may be, this
student body has fallen subject to a new motivation. Forgetting
for a moment its sources and its methods, such a motivation
is healthy in so far as it brings the student of Washington and
Lee to a better understanding of his status as an individual
and as a scholar. On the other hand, it is indeed unfortunate
that such an innovation had to issue from the rabble-rousing
techniques and propaganda tricks of a self-esteemed pedant and
his small coterie of ne’er-do-wells and angry young men. What
this group has failed to grasp is that wisdom of the past, which
we speak about above, upon which the institutions they wish
to shatter were founded. In a rash outpouring of personal in-
sults the “protest” movement was initiated to shatter the icons
of our complacency. Icons there may have been; but to break
up a way of life—the good and the bad—just for the sake of
breaking violates any rational understanding of purpose. The
movement later gained momentum when personal aggrandize-
ment raised its ugly, obvious head. If the student body of
Washington and Lee ever again leaves itself vulnerable to
gadfles of such questionable motives and character, they are
endangering their own personal values as well as the proven
heritage of this university.

Athletics

In other areas which merit criticism, I would only re-em-
phasize, first, the seemingly nebulous organization and expen-
ditures of the athletic department. Because non-subsidization is
a reality here, we should not maneuver to avoid the restrictions
of such a concept, but try to improve our athletic life within it.
In earlier editorials, I have called the athletic department to
challenge on many cases which are indicative of faulty admin-
istration and an unwillingness to accept the system of non-sub-
sidization. First, the levy of excessive admission charges to
football games which taxed considerably a student’s date and
family was cited. Not only was the gate charge unrealistic, but
it was arrived at arbitrarily without the consent of the Univer-

 

Graduation Day

The following editorial was written in 1947 by Charles
McDowell, then a student at Washington and Lee, and now a
columnist for the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Things are pretty
much the same today.

One bright June morning pretty soon now a crowd will
gather at a little college chapel to see graduation. They will
take seats on the hard, straightbacked seats inside the little
building or on the rows of folding chairs set up in the sun-
shine and maple-shade outside.

Mothers and fathers will meet other mothers and fathers,
and little sisters will be introduced to roommates. A great-
grandfather will tell a girl from Hollins about the time he sat on
the same hard seats waiting for his own diploma.

Four young wives will sit together talking about new ad-
dresses and the old bridge club. An usher who is just a little
hung over will show an elderly lady who hasn’t missed a gradu-
ation in thirty years to her seat.

As people with cameras edge closer to the sidewalk, a bell
will ring. A long line of boys in black robes and tassled hats will
move down the center walk two-by-two and out of step. Some
will smile, some will frown, and some will seem sad.

They will file into the little chapel; there will be coughing
and scraping of feet; and then a man will begin to speak. The
graduating class of 1961 will sit down and listen.

The man will talk about Washington and Lee and a boy in
the third row will look out the windows at the green tree in the
sun and he will think of Washington and Lee. He will remem-

(Continued on page 6)

 

sity Committee on Athletics—a seldom functioning body, in
my opinion, which shares the blame in the majority of these
athletic abuses. Secondly, student funds seem to attach them-
selves to other athletic strings, rather thar’ the ones for which
they were appropriated. Each student has been paying by the
semester for adequate gymnasium facilities and equipment.
Even with this burdensom assessment in the clutches of the
athletic department, the gym remains an antiquated barn, ill-
furnished and needing drastic repair. There is irony in the fact
that the student who is charged such an exorbitant fee ($70)
is not even allowed the use of a towel. Also, every fraternity
man at Washington and Lee pays $3.00 annually to participate
in intramural athletics without any evidence as to where the rev-
enue is going—save for minimal equipment and _ referee
charges. Approximately $3,000.00 is netted yearly in revenue
by this emanation of the athletic department, and the student
becomes the dupe once again. The student body is very proud
of its football team which is yearly soaring to new heights, but
perhaps is unaware of the fact that near-lavish spending on this
team prevents the other inter-collegiate teams from having
adequate uniforms and equipment. The drift to blatant mis-
management in the athletic department must be checked .

Fraternities

Finally, much needs to be done to halt the excess and
unnecessary fraternity spending. Such wasted luxury only
burdens the student whose means are more modest than those
of the simple majority which overrides him. With Washington
and Lee’s expanding scholarship program will come more stu-
dents who will be unable to meet the financial demands of our
socially competing fraternities. This is a change that must come
from within, or face direction from without. It is incumbent
upon fraternity officers and members to give consideration to
this financial irrationality and take steps to curb it.

 

Spirit of Washington and Lee

Aside from lesser shortcomings, Washington and Lee’s
greatest assets cannot be cited enough. One of the strongest
features of our student life is the Honor System. Here is a mas-
sive spirit of honor which permeates our collective existence at
Washington and Lee, but recognizes the honor of an individual.
The one single feature of this university’s life that means the
most to those who have gone before is our Honor System.

Incorporated along with the Honor System in the “‘Spirit
of Washington and Lee” is its glorious heritage, its traditional
desire for academic excellence, its superior instructors and
administrators, and the enviable sense of dedication that is
reflected in the lives of men like Dean Frank J. Gilliam whose
love for this university is complemented by a history of out-
standing service.

If this editorial smacks of nostalgia or sentimentality,
it is only because it marks the culmination of many happy and
satisfying moments with the Ring-tum Phi and four years of
association at this university for which I am most grateful.

Expression, as I have come to realize, is the most powerful
single tool for the planting and harvesting, or the destruction,
of an idea. To appreciate the combined efforts that go into
the publishing of the Ring-tum Phi, an attempt at expression, is
to thank those many students and university personnel whose
contributions have made the success of our newspaper possible.
I would like to pay particular tribute to the columnists and
staff of the Friday Edition, and especially George Honts, for
their many hours of tedious work. To Mr. Harold Lauck, my
sincere thanks for his tolerance and effort on behalf of the
student newspaper, and to his staff, Charles Perfetti, Edward
Walker, Lynwood Pullen and Edward Backus, goes the grati-
tude of all of us.

Webster Abridges The Past And Future

By ED WEBSTER
Tuesday Columnist

It’s pretty frustrating to try to
sum up a lot of private memories
for other people to read. Probably
Charlie McDowell did as good a job
as anyone could ever do; that’s why
we reprint his essay on the editorial
page at the end of every term.

Although we hurry to be rid of
the old scenes and move on to new
experiences, the old scenes look
somewhat more attractive when
the’re seen in retrospect. We love
familiar things because they give
us a sense of security. That’s why
we like to read about green grass,
and autumn hillsides, a memorable
lecture, a bull session, Goshen
2 ae

We seniors will squirrel away our
old yearbooks and drag them out
for our children one day. We will
point out Old George, and the Colon-
nades, and the fraternity house—and
we'll hope that nothing has chaned
too much.

* od a

But change is the great law of
modern life; we will take our places
as lawyers businessmen or teachers
in a world that alters with bewilder-
ing swiftness.

Unfortunately many of us will
refuse to recognize the fact that
the changes—social, political, eco-
nomic, and scientific—will force us
to abandon our comfortable pat-
terns of thinking and living. Such
people, groomed to be leading cit-
izens, will actually play only a
negative role in society: they will
keep other people from moving
ahead too fast.

Unfortunately too, many of us
were defeated in this race before
it even started. Many seniors will
leave here with the same ideas that
they. had as freshmen, except per-
haps that their morals will be a
little looser. For many of us, the
last four years have been nothing
but an extension of prep school—a
wasted period when nothing is ven-
tured and nothing is gained.

Many of us will never again
open a thought-provoking book, or
attend a worthwhile lecture, or ex-
perience a new thought or feel-
ing. Many of us will wrap our-
selves up in our smug little self-
centered worlds, while the real
world passes us by.

In short, many W&L graduates
will be mediocre citizens, just as
they were mediocre students.

The fault lies partly with the in-
dividuals who come here. But some
of the blame must be laid on the
disorganized curriculum that mas-
querades as our program of educa-
tion.

Surely the faculty committee that
is studying revisions in the curricu-
lum could not have failed to notice
the deadening effect that the fresh-

 

man and sophomore years have on*

a student.

Surely the committee cannot
have overlooked abusrdity of or-
ganizing history, literature, and
the social sciences as separate, and
even incompatible, disciplines. Nor
can the committee have failed to
see that the memorization of un-
related facts, which can win an
“A” in most courses, entirely miss-
es the point of education.

Surely the committee is aware of

Jon McLin Reflects On Merits
Of Oxford and American Systems

By JON McLIN

OXFORD, May 8—As this year’s
Ring-tum Phi, and with it the series
of these columns, is drawing to a
close, it is appropriate that this last
piece concern itself with some final
reflections on the relative merits
of the Oxford system, with respect
to American universities.

In doing so, I hope to tread more
gently upon ground which has been
rather abruptly broken by a Har-
vardian at Oxford. Comparing Ox-
ford to his U.S. alma mater in a re-
cent article in one of the University
magazines, he rather tactlessly told
his readers a few truths, and even
more blatant lies, about the super-
iority of Harford to Oxford. The
description of the occurrence in the
New York Times placed the article
in perspective by identifying

nority who held such views.

Ask an English student what he
considers the greatest merit of/|j

American universities and he will
say the oportunity for the breadth
of study, ie., for stuavying many
different subjects before specializing
in one.

This points up the contrast with
Britain, where students begin to
specialize in one course of study
even in their last two years of
secondary school. This is followed
by three years at Oxford or Cam-
bridge where they study only one
subject. The PPE course—philoso-

its | §
author as one of a disgruntled mi-|}

 

phy, politics, economics—is the
broadest one here and so is under-
standably popular with American
students.

Of course the most distinguishing
feature of Oxford’s type of education

 

Rhodes Scholar McLin
Former Editor of R-t P

is the tutorial system. And signifi-
cantly, it is here that both the
greatest strength and the greatest
weakness of the system lie.

The strength is the individual at-
tention which is given to the stu-

 

dent. The attendant advantages of
this is the establishment of standards
of judgment and the setting of a pace
suited to the individual rather than
to the average of a class.

The weakness lies in the fragmen-
tation which results from the one-

| essay-a-week approach to work. One

may get keen insights into eight

™ problems during the eight weeks
4 and eight tutorials of one term, but

he is unlikely to have a very com-

# prehensive view of his subject mat-

ter.
Another weakness is the undue

F reliance it places upon the quality
. of the tutors. While a good tutor
'can make the system an excellent

one, a poor tutor can make it less
than ineffective. And even scupu-
lous college wardens cannot avoid
a few poor tutors.

Similarly, the greatest strength
and greatest weakness of the Ameri-
can system can be seen from out-
side to lie in its most characteristic
feature—the organized series of lec-
ture. The merit, of course, lies in the
opportunity it presents for that inte-
gration and  comprehensiveness
which the British system has been
seen to lack.

But its great weakness—some Bri-
tons would argue that it is one that
is seldom overcome—is that it in-
duces in the student the attitude
that he’s done enough when he has
fulfilled the requirements of his

be, will lead an existence here
which is as boring as tears. In other
words, to say it shortly but sweetly,
some of us will study, and this, as
any fool can tell us, is not the way
to pure happiness. I would like to
hold myself up as an example of
an individual which has _ never
studied but who still gets by.

Before these freshmen enter our
doors of higher learning, flung
open wide for them, next fall, they
will receive so many long and heart-
rending letters that they will need
to put their noses to the grindstone
in order to make heads or tails out
of said letters.

They will have to labor like Tro-
jans in their Heculean efforts to
separate the whys and the where-
fores of said letters. Many lesser
men would sink to the depths of
dispair at the idea of tackling such
a task as that which will soon loom
on the horizon before each and
every one of next year’s freshmen.

I have felt that there is a long-
felt need of presenting clearly and
directly to incoming freshmen a
crystal clear criterion whereby
they may judge between the true
and the false in such letters as
they may receive during the sum-
mer forthwith to come. The acid
test in separating the sheep letters
from the goat letters is this: look
with suspicion on any letter that
tells you that your college days
must be days of study. You can
pass through this university like
an eel through water without
opening a book.

The undercurrent of excitement
which weighs heavily on the stu-
dent matriculating into this univer-
sity is no deep, dark secret. Slowly
but surely each and every student
must find himself and become
abreast of the times. During his first
few weeks here he may figure he
has a tough row to hoe and may
work like a Trojan into the wee
small hours of the morning. He may

Rhodes Scholar Comments
On British And U.S. Education

(Continued from page 3)
lecture courses—that literal adher-
ence to the class assignments that
are made fulfills his obligations as
a student and as a human being.
And, of course, nothing could be a
more improper view of education.

The case of the above Harvardian
is a good example of the tendency
which exists for Americans to feel
that Oxford’s great reputation is un-
justified. And while the reputation
may not be unjustified, it is mislead-
ing.

It is misleading because the stu-
dent who comes to Oxford expecting
an atmosphere of intense intellectual

stimulation, stimulating lectures,
and stimulating subjects will be dis-
appointed.

The atmosphere is almost the an-
tithesis of that. One will find rather
that what Oxford offers, basically, is
merely a wealth of great books, plen-
ty of people with whom to discuss
them and time to read.

This doesn’t sound like much,
perhaps, but its efficacy depends
upon an atmosphere which has
grown up here over the seven cen-
turies of its existence and which
cannot be adequately described to
be one who has not lived in it. A
supreme maxim here might be that
it is better to analyze one problem
lucidly, to answer one question
thoroughly than to do many mere-
ly adequately.

It should also be added, by way
of summary and conclusion, that
the greatest advantage of study in
Europe for an American are not
those derived from formal education

the hypocrisy of forcing a student
to pay $60 for certain “lecture”
courses when better material can be
found in a $6 textbook.

It is hoped that the University will
make some positive changes in the
present curriculum. Perhaps the
University, non incautus futuri, may
even dare to take some untred steps.

footsteps of certain northern schools.

but those which come from exposure
to other attitudes, other people who
possess different assumptions from
the ones he has been accustomed
to, tacitly and often unconsciously.

In general, study abroad—whether
in Britain or Europe—makes a more
objective view of the U.S. possible,
and both its strengths and weakness-
es become more visible, more mean-
ingful, and more important.

It is, in short, an experience of
such educational significance that
no one who has the opportunity
should fail to grasp it.

 

Dr. Marshall W. Fishwick To Lecture In Germany
On Fulbright Fellowship from April to August, ’62

Dr. Marshall W. Fishwick, pro-
fessor of American Studies at Wash-
ington and Lee, has been awarded
a Fulbright fellowship for lecturing
in Germany in 1962, Dean William
W. Pusey, I, has announced.

Dr. Fishwick will help establish
two new seminar courses in Ameri-
can society and thought and Ameri-
ican art and architecture at the
Johann Gutenberg University in
Mainz, Germany. He will be in Ger-
many from April to August, 1962.

Dr. Fishwick will also lecture at
other German universities and will
take part in a summer seminar on
American literature at Nice, France.

 

The Fulbright lectureship, award-
ed through the Department of State,
is the second such grant received
by Dr. Fishwick in three years. In
1958 he took part in a similar pro-
gram in Denmark.

Dr. Fishwick, 37, a prolific author
of books dealing mainly with the
South, joined the Washington and
Lee faculty in 1949. He holds de-
grees from the University of Vir-
ginia, the University of Wisconsin,
and Yale University. He is a native
of Roanoke.

Dr. Fishwick’s latest books are:
Virginia, a New Look at the Old Do-
minion, and Lee’s Photographer.

Agelasto To Head UCA Next Year

Pete Agelatso, a Phi Psi ris-
ing senior has been elected to
succeed Malcolm Brownlee as
president of the University

Christian Association.

Other newly-elected officers are
Mac McKay, a Phi Kap rising junior,
vice-president; Mark Whitehead, a
KA rising senior, secretary; and
Keith Carr, a Beta rising junior,
treasurer.

Ashley Wiltshire, a Delt rising
junior, will head the committee in
charge of the newly-instituted Sem-
inars in Religion next year. The
seminars will include panel discus-
sions on topics of current interest,
such as the popular discussions on
sit-ins held this year.

Community Service by the UCA
will be handled by Phil Farnsworth,
KA rising sophomore, and George
Spaulding, Phi Kap rising sopho-
more. Community service programs
will include assisting in the con-
struction of houses for the poor and
handing out food parcels in needy
areas.

Jay Smith and Walt McManus,
both Phi Psi rising sophomores, will
supervise Boys’ Club work next
year. The UCA has been particularly

 

Danforth Workshop

Four members of the Washington
and Lee faculty will participate
this summer in a three-week Work-
shop at Colorado Springs, Colo.,
sponsored by the Danforth Founda-
tion.

The purpose of the workshop is
“to provide for intensive study of
ways and means of raising the level
of excellence in such aspects of
the campus community as curricu-
lum, administration-faculty-student
relationships, counseling, evaluation,
and religion and values in regard to
educational objectives.”

Washington and Lee participants
will be Dr. Sidney Coulling, assist-
ant professor of English, Dr. E. C.
Griffith, head of the department of
economics, Dr. E. P. Turner, Jr.,
newly apointed head of the depart-
ment of physics, and Dr. W. W.
Pusey, Dean of the College.

Twenty-seven liberal arts colleges
will be represented at the workshop,
including Kenyon, Oberlin, Smith
and Swarthmore Colleges and Emory
and Washington Universities.

active in organizing sports activities
for local boys.

Ken Lane, a Phi Delt rising sopho-
more, will be in charge of UCA-
sponsored worship service next year.
He will organize the Christmas and
Easter services and plans to arrange
regular weekly services with visiting
speakers next year.

Dan Jenifer, a rising sophomore,
will direct the mountain missions
program next year. He will lead
volunteer students who conduct
Sunday School classes in small
churches in the Rockbridge area.

The UCA executive committee met
at Rockbridge Baths last week to
evaluate the progress of their or-
ganization and to redefine its goals.
“It is believed that such a re-
evaluation is necessary,” said Age-
lasto, “in order tht the UCA and
it program may be received on cam-
pus free from the label of over-
pious evangelism.”

“Next year,’ Agelasto added,
“more emphasis will be placed upon
discussion groups concerning issues
of campus importance. There will
also be a new concentration on com-
munity service projects and Boys’
Club work”

Each denomination in town will
have a representative on the UCA
next year: Bill Smith, a rising SAE
junior; Craig Distlehorst, a rising
junior; Dan Balfour, a Sigma Nu
rising junior; Bob Brewer, a Sigma

It goes without saying that quick

tentions. He will trip the light fan-
tastic at Hollins, Sweet Briar, or
Lexington or some other place
nestled in the hills of the beautiful
Shenandoah Valley.

He will explore the briny depths
of Goshen Pass. He will invest his
talents in those courses which will
pay him the best interest for his
efforts so that he can make the
best possible grades with the least
possible work. He will learn that
you can express the fewest things
in the most words if you can use
said words right. In short, each
and every one of his actions will
be clothed in an undiluted ray of
sunshine, and he will be the proud
possessor of a new lease on life.

Last but not least I wish to ex-
press my best wishes to those who
are soon to embark upon the golden
days of their college career. I speak
from the heart in wishing that as
you wind your way through our
ivy-coated halls, the days you spend
here may be the happiest of your life.
May your life be rich as gold; your
actions, smooth as silk; your motives,
pure as pearls; your work fine as
spun glass. In other words, may
there be a silver lining back of
every cloud you see. And when
that inevitable time slowly but
surely arrives when your college
friendships soon must sever, may the
bitter end of your golden days find
you ready and willing to embark on
a bigger and better career in this
modern day and age. And may all
of you remember always that “where
ignorance is, 'tis folly to be wise.”

ber the glare of the sun in his eyes as he lay on a big warm rock
in Goshen Pass listening to tumbling water. He will remember
sitting on the grass in the Spring talking and drinking a Coke.

He will remember a lecture on Milton and a power lawn
mower droning across the wide expanse of green outside. He
will remember a fraternity room late at night filled with cigar-
ette smoke and argument and friendship.

He will remember a hillside red and gold and amber in the
Fall. He will remember a cold winter night in a car rolling
toward Lexington and a wonderful off-key song. And he will
remember running down the hill from the Library at dusk along
the slick cement walks with Spring rain falling in the dark trees.

He will remember . . . Washington and Lee.
