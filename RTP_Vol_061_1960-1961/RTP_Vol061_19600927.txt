400 Old Grads
Will Attend

Homecomings

Some 400 alumni and their wives
are expected to return October 7 and
8 for Washington and Lee’s annual
Homecomings football weekend.
This year W&L’s Generals will meet
the Diplomats from Franklin and
Marshall.

“We have scheduled Homecomings
early this year in order to take ad-
vantage of Lexington’s beautiful fall
weather. We feel that this will make
the weekend more enjoyable for the
returning alumni, and will further
encourage campus decorations,”
stated Mr. William C. Washburn,
Alumni Secretary.

Mr. Washburn urged that fra-
ternities begin plans for Home-
comings early this year, and
warned that the early date might
take many by surprise. As usual,
the fraternities will compete for
the best decorations and for Home-
comings Queen.

Four awards will be made this
year for Homecomings decorations.
The judging will be done by an im-
partial committee picked by the
Alumni Association, and will be
based on originality of design and
of skill of construction. Last year’s
awards included a large silver tray,
an expensive table and chair set,
and $25 worth of records.

The Interfraternity Council again
plans to sponsor selection of the
Homecomings Queen. Details are to
be announced later in the month. The
Homecomings Queen is traditionally
crowned during the halftime cere-
monies. Franklin and Marshall’s
marching band is also scheduled for
halftime entertainment.

Last year, 365 alumni and their
wives attended Homecomings, and
this year there are indications
that the number will increase. The
Alumni Association has again plan-
ned a full round of activities.

Dr. Edgar W. Spencer, head of
Washington and Lee University’s
Department of Geology, has been
elected vice president of the Yellow-
stone-Bighorn Research Association

Student Cooperation
Vital to EC Members

(Editor’s Note: This is the sec-
ond in a series of articles designed
to familiarize the student body
with the mechanics of the honor
system and the Executive Commit-
tee of the student body.)

The Executive Committee is com-
posed of twelve duly elected mem-
bers of the student body. The presi-
dent, vice-president and secretary
of the student body who are elected
in the “Big Seven” elections each
spring, are officers of the committee.

The remaining membership of the
Committee is made up of two com-
mitteemen from the senior academic
class; one from each of the other
academic and law classes, and one
man appointed to represent the Pub-
lications Board.

The primary duty of the Executive

 

Committee is to interpret the honor
system. The Executive Committee
would emphasize that the respon-
sibility for maintaining the integri-
ty of the honor system at Washing-
ton and Lee rests upon the should-
ers of the students. The members
of the Committee are pledged to do
everything within their power to
uphold this integrity. Without one
hundred per cent cooperation from
every member of the Student Body,
the Committee can not do a perfect
job.

It is the duty of every student,
not only to respect the honor code
himself, but also to report any sus-
pected violation on the part of an-
other student to one of the Execu-
tive Committee members.

IFC Meets With

Proctor Murray

The IFC held a short meeting Mon-
day night in the Student Union.
At the first of the meeting Univer-
sity Proctor Bob Murray discussed
the automobile regulations and
warned that many automobiles still
have not been registered under
the new University rules. Offenders,
he said, will lose their driving priv-
ileges if this rule isn’t followed.

It was decided that an extension
to Thursday noon will be allowed
for turning in Homecoming Queen
entrants by the different fraternities.

Last year’s outstanding freshman
will be chosen soon by the IFC. Also
an IFC committee is working on
rules to enforce anti-hazing regula-
tions by fraternities here.

On Sunday, Oct. 2, a reception
will be held in the Evans Dining
Hall for the five new housemothers
now in Lexington. The housemothers
and two members of each fraternity
are invited to attend this reception
at 2:30 p.m.

During the year the three new
exchange students will dine at each
of the fraternity houses.

Next week, Dr. Pusey, Dean of the
College, will address the IFC con-
cerning the new academic regula-
tions of the University.

 

personal relations and greater

*understanding between parents and
the University.

Scheduled activities for the
weekend will begin Friday after-
noon and include campus tours,
visits to the Lee Chapel, parental
attendance in classes, and a Glee
Club concert. Parents will also
have the opportunity to confer with
faculty members during two con-
ference periods.

A meeting of the Parents’ Advis-
ory Council will be held Friday af-
ternoon. Under the guidance of
Chairman L. 'P. Nelson, Jr., of Cul-
peper, Va., the Council will discuss
topics of interest to parents and ways
in which the parents may serve to
better the University. In the past,
the Council has made recommenda-
tions concerning such things as auto-
mobile regulations.

For the first time a home football
game will be held during the Parents’
Weekend. On Saturday the 22, the
Generals will meet Johns Hopkins
on the gridiron.

Other events arranged for the par-
ents include departmental displays;
a “Report on the State of the Uni-
versity” by student leaders, adminis-
trative officers of the school, and
members of the Parents’ Advisory
Council; panel discussions by facul-
ty members; and a buffet luncheon
for parents and their sons in the
Letitia Pate Evans Dining Hall. Last
year the faculty panel discussions,

Enthusiasm Grows

Washington and Lee has in the past been known for it’s out-
standing school spirit. It was this spirit that made the Wash-
ington and Lee Swing so famous throughout our land. It was
this spirit that pushed so many of the school’s subsidized athletic

teams to victory.

With the advent of the school’s program of nonsubsidiza-
tion, this great school spirit seemed to fall with the fortunes of
the athletic teams. Crowds at the games began to wither away.
Interest in all forms of athletics seemed to be lost forever from

the student body.

Participation in athletics and especially in football dwin-
dled to an unprecedented low. It became necessary to call fresh-
man athletes up to play on the varsity level. The general student
attitude discouraged the “gung-ho” freshman from risking life
and limb on the athletic field and encouraged him to give up his
athletic endeavors and the sacrifices that went with them for a
life of social ease and intellectual pursuit (which, by the by,
may not necessarily go hand in hand).

This lack of spirit in the student ranks may have been
understandable. Washington and Lee’s fans were used to seeing
the big teams of Virginia and the South appear on Wilson Field.
They were used to seeing these teams meet on even terms. Un-
der the new program they saw “‘little” teams trounce the flound-
ering Blue Saturday after Saturday. It was difficult to be enthus-
iastic under these circumstances.

These days are gone from Washington and Lee. The old
fans are gone. There is a new fan who has never seen the
University of Virginia play on Wilson Field. (We may see it
sooner than we think if the Wahoos don’t shape up.) He is
interested in Washington and Lee’s football team. He is interest-
ed in seeing his fraternity brothers play. And most of all he is
interested in seeing a winning team. There were three thousand

of the new fans in the Wilson
noon.

Other evidence of increasing school spirit is the growing
number of boys interested in participating in intercollegiate
athletics at Washington and Lee.
are dressing some forty-two boys for their games. The varsity
squad has forty-three members. The soccer and cross-country
teams have grown in the past couple of years. All of this is en-

couraging.

We feel that the change should be accredited to the athletic
department and especially the coaches who have done such an

excellent job of recruiting the

student body not only for offering its support to the teams dur-
ing the games, but also for encouraging the freshman and soph-

omore athletes to participate.

Rockbridge Concert Series Opens
Oct. 17 With Yugoslav Ensemble

A world-famous instrumental en-
semble from Yugoslavia, the Solisti
di Zagreb, will open the 1960-61
Rockbridge Concert Series on Mon-
day, Oct. 17. This group was en-
thusiastically acclaimed by critics
and public alike when they toured
the United States three years ago.
Some Lexington concert-goers heard
the Solisti when they appeared at
Hollins College on that earlier tour
and found them very special instru-
mental music makers.

Conductor of the ensemble is An-
tonio Janigro, an Italian by birth,
who moved to Yugoslavia in 1939 and
became the leading musical person-
ality of that country. He ranks as
one of the world’s principle cellists
and has appeared as guest soloist and
guest conductor with major orches-
tras in Europe and America. He will
play Boccherini’s Concerto in B flat
major for violincello and_ strings
in the group’s Lexington concert.

On December 13, Robert MacDon-
ald, who opened last year’s Wash-
ington and Lee Concert Guild series
with a brilliant piano recital, will
make a return visit to Lexington
for the second event in the Rock-
bridge series. Mr. MacDonald, who

Passing of Co-op Spirit Bemoaned

By BILL ROBERTS

“The Co-op” means many things to
many people. To the newly-arrived
freshmen it is the sum of what they
have heard about it spiced with a
few personal experiences (not unlike
his knowledge of all other facets
of Washington and Lee.)

Joe Freshman can probably mus-
ter a few ideas about the Co-op. He
is used to the preface “so-called”
being affixed to “Co-op” by Profes-
sors trying to see that their stu-
dents get textbooks. He no doubt
has some experience, traumatic or
otherwise, with buying those texts.
He has noted that the counter help
is two-thirds uncooperative and
rude. He has noted that the co-op
resembles any modern drugstore ex-
cept it has no drug department.
And he perhaps has noticed the co-
op has pinball machines which cost
10c, because Washington and Lee
students are affluent enough to pay
10c to play pinball.

We do not choose to write about
the Co-op of today, or of its short-
comings or virtues. We want to talk
about The Spirit of the Co-op which
we believe an integral enough part
of the W&L Spirit to be enshrined
in one of those leaflets that the
Good Dean sends to prospective stu-
dents.

The Spirit of the Co-op is best
studied by observing the conduct of
a Member of the Co-op, an odd
being characterized by faithful at-
tendance at his Co-op Hours (free
periods) and a unique style to his
performance of these duties. I might
add that this species is found only in
the senior or junior classes. It is not
just coincidental that these two
classes are the only ones who are
fortunate enough to have used the
old Co-op.

The only way to study this van-
ishing species is to follow him
through his walk to the Co-op from
the hill, his performance at the Co-
op and his walk back. A chronologi-
cal study of a typical 10:15 team
member will reveal the essential
co-op style and some of its chang-
ing aspects.

The Walk to the Co-op. The true
Co-oper must leave class with every
intention of going to the library to
study during his free period. But as
he leaves the classroom building (not
before) he is permitted to sound out
another habitue thus, “Co-op?”

The initial step taken, a delicate
role-play begins in which the first

 

man to say he has to study must use
every argument at his command to
keep from being dragged down the
hill by the second man. Both roles
are considered desirable and an old
hand can play either to the hilt.
Some slight exaggeration in regard
to hour quizzes and to the quality
of Co-op coffee is permitted by the
Honor System.

The Performance in the Co-op.
Upon entering the Co-op the team
member must not recognize the pres-
ence of other team members who are
ensconced at the tables there, for
to do so and go on to the counter
would imply that he would rather
eat than talk. After buying a drink or
something to eat, (not over 35c worth
—for this too implies eating and
drinking were the primary purposes
of the visit) he joins his usual team.

Teams used to be limited only by
fraternity status and common inter-
ests, but now they are limited to
seven or eight by the size of the
new co-op tables. This size limita-
tion has considerably shrunk the
depth and breadth of Co-op discus-
sion.

The Course of Conversation. The
team member as he joins the group
must hold his peace until he ascer-
tains the topic under consideration.
To break the chain of conversation
by mentioning what Easy Ed or any
other professor did last period is
horribly gauche.

Conversation must proceed by free
association with no leadership or
restraint. A man’s contribution is
limited only by the number of sub-
jects he knows nothing about. A
typical session will begin by some-
one mentioning a coin he received in
his change, proceed to coin-collect-
ing, to counterfeiting, to bank tellers
we knew, to clods in general, and so
on until the team begins to break
up for its next class.

The End of the Period. The strict
protocol for this phase of the team

chaos by the transfer of the Co-op
to its new quarters. Previously a man
once he sat down was honor-bound
to stick with the team to the bitter
end. But differences in walking speed
have become noticeable over the
longer distance up the hill and some
people have to leave for class earlier
than others.

The antiseptic quality of the new
Co-op has given some people an in-
tense desire for fresh air as have the
new picture windows. Thus, some
rather striking concession to individ-
ualism have been made in the matter
of de parture time.

All in all, the new Co-op has
brought an end to the old Co-op and
its style of life. Instead of the old,
poorly lighted and somewhat dingy,
but intensely alive Co-op we have a
new, well-lighted building which
breeds men as sterile as their sur-
roundings. Faculty and students can-
not hide from each other in segre-
gated rooms. Nor can anyone find
enough darkness to hide from SIPA
delegates, pipe salesmen, or other
interlopers.

 

Christian, Gilmore Named

The Executive Committee an-
nounced last night additional ap-
pointments to two of the university
student organizations. Meade Chris-
tian has been named to the Assimi-
lation Committee. Park Gilmore will

the University Committee on Ath-
leties.

Christian, a Phi Gam sophomore
from Richmond, was appointed to fill
the position left vacant by Kemp
Morton.

Singers and Dancers of Scotland will
be presented as the third event in
the local series. Founded and direct-
ed by Andrew Macpherson, Cale-
donia! has had a phenomenal rise to
success and popularity in Scotland.
The company appears regularly on
television in Great Britian and will
bring to American audiences a full
range of song and dance from all the
regions of Scotland.

The National Symphony Orches-
tra, which in the thirteen years it
has been making annual appearances
in Lexington has grown into one of
the great symphonic ensembles of
this country, will close the 1960-61
Series on February 20. With a
greatly expanded schedule of con-
certs in Washington and a tour into
southwestern states, the Orchestra’s
Lexington concerts will be one of
only three or four appearances in
Viriginia during the year. The Rock-
bridge Education Association will
again sponsor a student matinee.

The normal quota of adult mem-
bership was about 70 per cent sold
out in last spring’s pre-season re-
newal campaign. The fall drive is
now underway for enrollment of
adult, college, and public school
members and will continue through
Oct. 10.

Washington and Lee students will
find tickets available from a num-
ber of faculty members at conven-
ient locations throughout the cam-
pus, including Profs. Fishwick and
Stephenson at duPont Hall, Prof.
Coulling in the English Department,
Prof. Watt in Chemistry, Miss Louise
Moore at the Law School, Prof.
Stewart and Mr. Coleman at the Li-
brary, Prof. Wheeler at Newcomb

Latin American Excursion

By HARVEY ALLEN

Dr. Charles W. Turner of Wash-
ington and Lee and Professor Fred
Brunner of Columbia University led
a twelve-student group in a tour of
Latin America this past summer,
sponsored by the National Student
Association.

The group’s aims were to visit
other college groups and to pro-
mote better understanding among
the students of these Latin Amer-
ican countries. In fulfilling these
aims, the group of students was a
sort of traveling seminar, with par-
ticular attention given to the econ-
omy and politics of the countries
visited.

Leaving Miami, Florida, by plane
on June 22 the group covered
some 16,000 miles, visiting Peru,
Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and
Brazil.

Capital cities were the main stop-
ping points in the countries visited,
as in the case of Lima, Peru, the
first stop on the tour, where the
group spent 12 days.

While in Lima, they visited schools
in the capital city, such as San
Marcos, the oldest in America. Be-
sides excursions to cathedrals and
other points of interest, they also
visited nearby Inca ruins, as well as
sugar and paper mills.

Dr. Turner noted that the pro-
fessors at San Marcos were very
interested to know in what way
and how much he and Professor
Brunner were paid, as many of
the professors there had to main-
tain several jobs to enable them
to keep teaching.

From Lima the group flew next to
Santiago, Chile. Here, as in many
other cases, the students lived in
homes in and around the city, pro-
viding unequalled opportunities to
live with the people of the country
that they were visiting and learn
more about them, first hand.

The Catholic University and the
University of Chile were the two
schools visited at Santiago, where
at the Law School of the Univer-
sity of Chile, the students were
holding elections, much like our
recent Mock Convention, but much
more serious. This election they
saw in progress had a national
flavor to it in that the candidates
running for offices, on the state and
local level, were tied in more
closely with the national election.

The group also had an opportunity,
while in Santiago, to visit the sites

 

of work being done in connection

 

Is Aged Faultfinding Valid?
Rush Week, Politics and Pledging

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

For those of us who prefer sta-
bility in the order of things, the
columnists of the two editions of the
Ring-tum Phi must have provided a
great deal of pleasure. All of the
old stand-bys made their appear-
ance: politics, rush week and hell
week. Neither subject matter nor
attitude has changed.

The “majority” party was once
again attacked, and the freshmen
were led to believe that student poli-
tics were under the tyranny of a

| local Tammany Hall. This is pretty

 

far from the truth, since out of the
seven major offices, three were de-
cided by margins of less than twenty-
seven votes and a fourth was won
by the “minority party.” It was
generally conceded that better or-
ganization would have split the ticket
entirely. With elections contested as
closely as they were last year it
seems pretty futile to call for politi-
cal reform. The political system we
have now has served Washington
and Lee well in the past and should
do the same in the future.

Rush Week got its lumps again,
the main complaint being that the
long hectic week doesn’t give fresh-
men or upperclassmen enough time
to properly evaluate each other. This
is an admitted disadvantage, but it
hasn’t hurt in the past, and there are
compensating advantages: with rush
week over when school starts, every-
one is ready to attend to the business
of being educated without the strain
an extended rush week would cer-
tainly bring; there are enough extra-
curricular activities to lure fresh-

men away from their studies without
adding another; additionally, without
social fraternities, there is very lit-
tle social life for the freshman.
Under the present system, he has
some place to which he ean bring
dates, and contacts to get him dates as
soon as school starts. Finally, im-
mediate rush assimilates the fresh-
man into the whole student body,
rather than simply leaving him tied

to the freshman class.

Hell Week, Help Week, Greek
Week or whatever other euphemism
you may use for the week of initia-
tion has been subject to criticism
for so long that it’s hard to find any-
one in favor of it. Sadist frankly
admit that they enjoy giving fresh-
men hell and the super-sensitive find
the whole business “simply brutal.”
However, since physical injury is
strictly forbidden and the freshmen
are guaranteed an adequate amount
of sleep, the real problem of hell
week is sincere enforcement of the
rules. The greatest part of hell week
is aimed at humiliation of fresh-
men, and can anyone deny that to
instill humility in a freshman is to
do a virtuous thing? If anyone thinks
hell week is too tough, let him in-
vestigate the initiation rites of the
Australian Bushmen.

But this column is not intended
to carp at those giving advice to
fresh freshmen. It is laudable so to
do. But it was more fun several years
ago when a Ring-tum Phi columnist,
evidently annoyed by freshmen dur-
ing rush week, offered this advice to
the freshmen: “Go directly to Hell.
Do not pass go, do not collect $200.”

with the Point Four program, such as
slum clearance projects. Dr. Tur-
ner noted that significant progress
was being made, but much more
still needed to be done.

From Santiago, the group flew
across the Andes to Buenos Aires,
capital city of Argentina. One of
the highlights of this stop was a
visit with President Frondizi, whom
they found to be quite willing to
answer their questions and supply
information. He did this to the point
of calling in some of his ministers
to answer detailed questions, par-
ticularly in the fields of economy
and politics.

Besides the usual visits to cathe-
drals, museums, and other points
of similar interest, the group also
paid a visit to a nearby ranch,
and saw the South American
gauchos, similar to our western
cowboys and cattle ranchers.

Montevideo, Uruguay, was the
next stop, where they found con-
siderable evidence of anti-U.S. feel-
ing and communism. Signs were
seen, even on large private homes,
reading, “Hail Castro!” The group
encountered, while shopping the
stores of the city, articles priced
very cheaply and a great deal of
trust on the part of shopkeepers.
Personal checks were accepted there
instead of the usual insistence on
traveler’s checks.

The flying tour winged next to
Sao Paulo, center of a growing in-
dustrial area in Brazil. Here the
group was impressed with the many
buildings of skyscraper proportions,
similar in many ways to Chicago.
They found the people very proud
of their native architecture, pastel
colored buildings and Frank Lloyd
Wright-type houses. The school
visited at this stop was Presbyterian
College Mackenzie, founded many
years ago by Presbyterian mission-
aries.

After a visit to the picturesque
Copacabana Beach, complete with
its bikini-clad bathers, the group
went on to Rio. There they met
Joe Sconce, a Washington and Lee
graduate, connected with the Point
Four program.

The final stop on the tour was
Brasilia, the fabulous new national
capital being constructed through
the combined efforts of some 50,-
000 workers.

After a flight over the Amazon
River and a brief stopover at the
Caracus, Venzuela, airport, the group
returned home, arriving on August 5.

 

Rush Week Changes
W&L Man Into Animal

By HENRY HARRELL

This is not a moralizing column. I
don’t want to write fiery editorials.
The fate of the Western world is
so far out of my hands that it loses
most of its interest for me. And I
don’t even care about the manifes-
tations of social decay detected in
almost all phases of Washington
and Lee life, at least by some former
columnists.

But one tradition at W&L bothers
me, or did until recently when I
went through it for the last time. I
refer, of course, to Rush Week. W&L
is supposed to be a school of gentle-
men. We have all sorts of hallowed
traditions and ideals. How is it that
for six days all restraints are thrown
aside, and we live like animals?
What is it that compells “dirty
rush,” the bitter rivalry between
fraternities, and most revolting of all,
the great scramble to get into the
dormitories?

For two years I have been a
member of IFC committees to
study Rush Week changes. The
first committee didn’t produce
much, but the second came up with
a very reasonable plan. which was
immediately rejected by the fra-
ternities with hardly any deliber-
ation, The proposal was to extend

Gridiron Win

Over Colonels

Washington and Lee’s Generals
opened their 1960 football season
with a 21 to 6 victory over Centre
College. After a sluggish first half
the Generals came back strong in
the third and fourth quarters to
win over Centre for the second
straight year.

W&L’s versatile offense and
player depth proved to be the de-
cisive factor in the Generals’ win.
The offense seemed to open up in
the second half as the Generals
scored in both of the final stanzas.

W&L won the toss of the coin and
elected to receive. On the first plays
from scrimmage, the Generals were
unable to move, forcing Danny Blain
to punt to the Centre 25 yard line.
After taking over on offense, Centre’s
quarterback, Kern Alexander, passed
to halfback Kaelin for 40 yards, but
an offside penalty nullified the play.

The Generals then took over and
began to move offensively, scor-
ing eight minutes after the open-

ing kickoff. After fullback Doug *—

Team, Students Need To Improve

Martin carried for seven yards,
quarterback Steve Suttle got the
first W&L touchdown of the day
on a “quick count” sneak play
which caught the Centre defense
completely off guard. Halfback
Bobby Funkhouser gained most of
the yardage in the scoring drive.

Centre was kept stationary until
the second quarter, but then quarter-
back Alexander and halfbacks Kaelin
and Gene Tassie spearheaded an 87-
yard scoring drive. An _ offsides
penalty against W&L gave Centre
new life during the drive, giving
them an important first down. Kaelin
carried the ball to pay dirt from
4 yards out, and the attempt for
a two-point conversion on a pass
play was broken up. W&L left the
field at halftime with an 8-6 lead.

The third quarter got off to a slow
start, but picked up in the closing
minutes when Skipper Smith took
a Centre punt on the W&L 14. How-
ever, the Generals were moved to
their 7 and a half yard line on a
penalty. Keesee moved the ball out
of the danger zone with a 23-yard
punt to the General’s 30. After two
ground plays and a 15-yard personal
foul penalty against Centre, Quarter-
back Suttle clicked on a 44-yard pass
play to sophomore halfback Charlie
Gummey for the second W&L touch-
down. A running attempt for the two
point conversion failed.

In the final quarter halfback
Richard Mosby intercepted an
Alexander pass and raced 26 yards
to the Centre 46. Doug Martin
burst through the Colonel line
and scooted the remaining 46 yards
for the third General score. Jim
Russ kicked the one point conver-
sion and the Generals led 21-6.

By alternating quarterbacks Sut-
tle, Robin Wood, and Phil Sharp,
the Generals had another drive going
late in the game, but Doug Martin’s
pass from the ten was intercepted in

By STEVE GUILD

Weshineton end Lee’s perform-
ance on the gridiron last Saturday
proves et least two things. One,
we can have a winning team not by
chance but by the skill of the players.
And two, when a team has some
wins to back it up, then the attitude
of the student body improves pro-
portionately. It was these two things
that were noticed most at last week’s
game.

Not until a team gets on the field
in an actual game can anyone really
tell how they will perform despite
all the pres-season guessing. How-
ever, it seems that the guesing was
fairly accurate this year, for the
team was all it was supposed to be
with a few added surprises thrown
in. Suttle and Wood executed some
slick plays, using to advantage Bob
Funkhouser’s speed and _ agility.
Doug Martin and Tommy Keesee ex-
ceeded the evaluations of them in
advance reports, and Terry Fohs held
the line together admirably in his
position. Bob Payne was probably
the biggest surprise and best line-
man of the day.

Although there were a number of
strong men on the team, the Blue
and White as a whole was not as
organized as it should have been.
On the defensive side the Generals
were hard-hitting and fast, but of-
fensively they did not begin to shape
up until the late 3rd and early 4th
quarters when they made two touch-
down passes within five minutes. The
passing game was average as it was

expected to be, being outshone in
this field by the Colonels. Centre’s
short screen passes were quite eTec-
tive in gaining needed first-down
yardage in several tight spots. The
ground game of the Generals which
has been concentrated upon more
than usual this year still needs some
work, especially in the mechanics of

| the plays. However, Coach Mc-
i Laughlin’s “Go-T” formation seemed

to work as well or even better than

, it did last year.

The second point that should be
made is that the attitude of the stu-
dent body toward football at Wash-
ington and Lee has changed consid-
erably in the last two years. Evi-
dence of this was the turnout for
the game Saturday. Granted this was
the first home game, but in the past
the stands have been hardly half
full. With last year’s improved recod
to bank on and the first game of
the season a victory, one can only
hope that the student body will
continue their interest and support
of the team.

Although there is still much work
to be done, Coach Mac and the Gen-
erals should be heartily congratu-
lated for their fine winning showing
last Saturday.

Washington and Lee University’s
soccer team opened its 1960 cam-
paign on a winning note by downing
Pfeiffer College of North Carolina
4 to 0.

The Generals showed yesterday
that they will again be a contender
for top honors in the state this year.
The score of yesterday’s game does
not give full justice to our soccer
team’s play, for most of the game
was played in Pfeiffer’s half of the
field. During the entire game, the
Generals’ goalies—Steve Paley,
Clark Valentiner, and Tom Green—
had to make only eight saves.

As the first quarter progressed,
(Continued on page 4)

The Coaches Corner

Coach Mac

Progress is wonderful. Two years
ago we were delirious when we
wrested a 1 point victory from Ran-
dolph-Macon. Saturday we were all
happy to win, but a mite-miffed not
to score at least one more touch-
down. I hope that we can continue
to expect our Generals to do well.

The win was a squad victory in
that 37 players were used, 33 of
them in the first quarter. All hands
contributed to the win, but the
“Gold” team which was used only
on defense performed particularly
well. My choice for the unsung hero
is Bobby Payne of the “Gold” unit
who made 7 tackles and was a real
hustler .

We are in the dark as to Dickin-
son’s relative strength as they have
not yet played a game. Last year they
beat Haverford 43 to 0 the week after

our game, but the rest of their season |:

was a “near miss” frustration as most
of their games were close, but no

 

 

 

 

 

X-C Wins

The Blue and White of Washington
and Lee defeated the Falcons of
Pfeiffer yesterday in a near shut-out.
The final score of the meet was 14-
48 which was only two points less
of a perfect score of 15-50. This was a
repeat of last year’s defeat over the
North Carolina team.

Six of the W&L harriers finished
before the first of the Pfeiffer men
came in. Taking first place in the
meet was Sophomore Mike Shank
with second place going to Mike
Brumby, one of the more promising
freshmen to come out this season.
Following Shank and Brumby were
third, fourth, and fifth placers Stoney

Frosh Win 20-0

W&L’s Baby Generals opened the
1960 football season by decisively
trouncing the Tigers from Hargrave
Military Academy in a 20-0 victory.
The freshman team, which has been
called W&L’s strongest to date, dis-
played an impressive defensive line
and surprising backfield speed which
the Hargrave eleven never seriously
threatened.

Halfback Henry Sackett led the
freshman offense and _ personally
amassed more than a_ hundred
yards rushing in the first half
alone. Sachett who played his high
school ball at E. C. Glass in Lynch-
burg, revealed promising speed and
a polished change of pace as he
averaged better than eleven yards
per carry.

Fullback Syd Butler and halfback
Steve Yoffe provided added punch
to the W&L backfield. Quarterback

Jack McDaniel seemed to have com-
| plete control of the rather compli-
| cated “Go-T” offense, a system new

   

Coach McLaughlin

 

 

to most of the freshmen players.

The defensive line, led by guard,
Charlie Savage; center, Mike Shef-
fey; and reinforced by linebacker

| Smitzie Kidd, held the hapless Tigers

to minus yardage.

Sackett scored two of the Baby
Generals’ three touchdowns, the first
coming on a 4-yard plunge early in
the first quarter, and the second on

|a similar play in one of the final
| seconds

of the game. The third
quarter tally came with a pass from

| McDaniel to Yoffe.

Also this week the co-captains

© of the freshman team were elected.

They are quarterbacks Henry Sack-
ett and John McDaniels. They will
be leading the team for the rest of

'| the season in their efforts to win.

The frosh will play Woodberry
Forest this Friday on Wilson Field.

the varsity’s play began to pick
up from its slow start. With four
minutes to go in the first quarter,
Jim Starkey scored the first goal
after a wild scramble for the ball
in front of the Pfeiffer goal.

The Generals added two more goals
in the second quarter. With three
minutes just gone in the quarter
Steve Hawkins found himself wide
open for a shot to make the score
2 to 0. Four minutes later co-captain
Dave Knight took a cross pass from
Wick Hollingshead to add another
score. The first half came to an end
with Washington and Lee leading
3 to 0.

There was no scoring in the third
quarter, but Bob Pagano got the
fourth and last goal after five minutes
had passed in the fourth period.
Pagano scored with a sharp boot on
a free kick.

After the game, Coach Joe Lyles
said, “I was very pleased with the
boys, but naturally there is plenty
of room for improvement. That
first of the season is the hardest
one to get, but I feel we are now
on the way to a successful season.
The Pfeiffer team should not be
underestimated, for they are well
coached.” Lyles singled out Dun-

Harrell On Rush Week

(Continued from page 2)

Rush Week until after Thanksgiv-
ing holidays, thus eliminating the
pressure and much of the unpleas-
antness from our six day rushing.

A good many boys are going de-
ferred rush this year, more than
ever before, and to me this is signif-
icant. The Commons is partly re-
sponsible, but from personal impres-
sions I gather that our rushing pro-
cedures are the main reason.

As for the upperclassmen, I talked
with a good many while we were
waiting to push and shove our way
up into the dorms. The invarible
reaction was “This is really lousy,”
or “I'll be glad when rush is over
and we can all go back to being
friends.”

Everyone hates it, no one does any-
thing about it. Perhaps this year
the IFC can make some changes and
get fraternities to consent. At least
something might be done about the
methods of upperclassmen entering
the dorms. But until something is
changed, Rush Week will limp along,
an unfortunately real and unneces-
sarily unpleasant part of W&L.
