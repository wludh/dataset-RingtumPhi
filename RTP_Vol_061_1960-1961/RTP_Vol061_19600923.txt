Four Freshmen To Sing

 

Dr. Jones Names Committee

Troubadours To Have
More Student Control

“The Lady’s Not For Burning” May Be First Play;
Contemporary American Drama To Be Presented

A reception was held Wednesday,
Sept. 21, at 7:30 p.m. in the Trouba-
dour Theatre for all persons inter-
ested in participating in this sea-
son’s productions of the Troubadours,
the student dramatic organization.

Dr. Jones in Charge

Dr. Cecil B. Jones, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Fine Arts at Washington
and Lee, was in charge of the meet-
ing, the purpose of which was to
give the students a general idea of
what working with the Troubadours
would be like and of the type of
plays to be produced this season.

Student Committee

Recognizing a need for a strength-
ening of the organization of the
Troubadours involving more direct
student control, a committee for re-
organization was appointed by Dr.
Jones from the ranks of the more
experienced students. Members of
this committee are Steve Danzansky,
Tim Morton, Bob Allen, Frank
D’Lauro, John Dunnell, and John
Towler.

First Play

If readings are satisfactory, the
first play of the 1960-61 season will
be The Lady’s Not for Burning by
Christopher Fry. The date for the
readings of the first play will be an-
nounced later. Also planned for pre-

 

sentation are a contemporary Ameri-
can play such as Streetcar Named
Desire by Tennessee Williams and a
contrasting play by a European play-
wright which will in some manner be
a departure from the realistic modern
play.

Dr. Jones reported that the sale
of student season tickets has been
very successful.

Succeeds Lanich

Dr. C. B. Jones is succeeding Dr.
Lloyd J. Lanich as director of the
Troubadours.

Dr. Lanich resigned from the fac-
ulty last spring to accept a position as
assistant professor of drama at Po-
mona College in Clairmont, Cal.
There he planned to teach drama and
fine arts and to direct dramas. He
was a 1947 graduate of Washington
and Lee and studied at Yale Uni-
versity.

Dr. Jones has been a fine arts
teacher at Lamar State College in
Beaumont, Tex., for two years. He
received degrees from Vanderbilt
University, Northwestern University,
and the University of Illinois.

Last year’s productions staged by
the Troubs included Taming of the
Shrew and Rashomon, both of which,
along with other Troubadour pro-
ductions, received wide-spread local
acclaim.

 

W&L Honor System Is Explained;
Student Executive Committee
Reviews Evidence In Violation

(Editor’s note: This is the first
article of a series dealing with the
student government to explain the
basic mechanics of the honor sys-
tem.)

The Honor System assumes that
every student is a gentleman and re-
quires that he act as such in every
college activity. Any violation of
this principle—lying, cheating, steal-
ing, or failing to report a violation—
is a breach of the Honor System.

When an alleged violation of the
Honor System is reported by a stu-
dent or a member of the faculty, the
Executive Committee immediately
assembles.

After collecting and reviewing all
of the evidence, the Committee, by a
simple majority vote, may, should it
find sufficient evidence to proceed to
trial, empower the president of the
student body to present to the al-
leged violator the option of vol-
untarily withdrawing from school
before facing trial.

Such a withdrawal relieves a guil-
ty student of any overt “black mark”

 

upon his record; but should direct
inquiry be made by an institution,
the facts of his withdrawal are dis-
closed.

Should the accused be uncertain
as to his guilt or convinced of his
innocence and elect to stand trial,
the Executive Committee again re-
views the evidence and questions the
witness and the accused in a fair
and impartial hearing.

In the event that two-thirds of
the Committee vote that there is
clearly a breach of the Honor Sys-
tem, the student is required to leave
school.

If a convicted student still feels
that he has been judged unfairly,
he may ask for a public trial by a
jury composed of students above
the freshman class. Instances of
such trials are rare, though they
have occurred in the past. This is
the final appeal in the trial for
an alleged violation of the Honor
System.

A student who has accepted the

The Four Freshmen

 

Pictures of candidates for Home-
comings Queen must be turned in to
the IFC by Monday, Sept. 26, it is
announced by IFC president Dave
Lefkowitz. A faculty committee will
pick the Queen and she will reign
over the festivities during Homecom-
ings, Oct. 8.

Also planned for the homecomings
is a pep rally which will be held
under the direction of the Varsity
Club and is tentatively scheduled for
7:30 p.m. October 7 in the gym. The
annual parade for freshmen is also
being taken under consideration.

Washburn Comments

Mr. William Washburn, alumni
secretary, commented on the out-
standing decorations of the past
years and urged the fraternities to
begin their plans immediately in
order to maintain the high standards
of the past.

Last year, Mrs. Geneva Fitzen-
hagen, representing the Beta House,
was chosen Homecomings queen.

Biggs Announces Business
Staff Appointments Today

Huntley Biggs, business manager
of the Ring-tum Phi announced
the following appointments today
to the business staff of the paper:

Jerome Dattle, a ZBT junior from
Ruleville, Miss., has been appointed
to the post of Advertising Manager
of the Tuesday edition; Ed Holmes,
a SAE sophomore from Winona,
Miss., to head the advertising staff
of the Friday edition of the Ring-
tum Phi; and Herb Solomon, a ZBT
Junior will be the Office Manager.

Pete Agelesto, a Phi Psi junior
from London Bridge, Va., is to be
the Circulation Manager for both
papers.

UCA To Meet
Monday Night

The first business meeting of the
University Christian Association is
scheduled for next Monday night,
| Sept. 26, in the basement of the
| Student Union. The meeting is de-
| signed to give freshmen and newly-
interested upperclassmen a_ picture
of the activities of the UCA and
a chance to become incorporated in
these activities.

 

 

Committee chairmen will outline
the work of their committees and
those interested in a specific com-
mittee will be given a chance to
join it. Old UCA members are asked
to be present in order that the com-
mittees may make plans for the
coming year.

Malcolm Brownlee, president of
the Association, says that the UCA
will emphasize discussion groups
more this year. “We feel that dis-
; cussion on religious and _ ethical
questions are among our most im-
portant functions,’ he said. “Our
discussions last year were well re-

Pep Rally, Queen And Fraternity

Decorations Spark Homecomings

 

The Delts won the decoration tro-
phy for the third straight year and
the Phi Gams Captured the spirit
trophy. However, the Generals were
defeated by the Carnegie Tech Tar-
tans, 20-16.

Also during the first IFC meet-
ing of the year, held last Monday,
Dean James D. Farrar spoke on
pledging and distributed a list of
social regulations to the house pres-
idents.

Wood Elected

Robin Wood, SAE junior, was
elected to the position of IFC social
chairman. His duties will include
the scheduling of parties for the in-
dividual houses.

The IFC also expressed its appre-
ciation to Ned Olds, SAE senior,
for his work as chairman of the
Rush Week activities this year.

The IFC committee on “Help
Week,” headed by Dave Leftowitz,
is to meet this week to consider
plans for the help activities this
year.

Regulations Prohibit
Drinking At Games;
EC Asks Cooperation

Washington and Lee’s rule pro-
hibiting drinking on the campus will
be strictly enforced at all home ath-
letic contests, Student Body Presi-
dent Kent Frazier said today.

The regulation will be implement-
ed by the members of the Execu-
tive Committee.

Quoting from the original state-
ment issued by an earlier Committee,
“Attention is called to the fact that
in the spring of 1952 the Executive
Committee of the Student Body as-
sumed from the University admin-
istration the responsibility for the
conduct of students at all home
athletic contests.”

Cooperation Asked

 

“This responsibility was then and |
is currently assumed in the belief
that the Executive Committee could |
better perform this task than the |
University Administration, in the |
interest of both the student body |
and the University.”

The statement goes on to say that |
“as a part of this responsibility the
Executive Committee is charged with
the enforcement of University stand-
ards of gentlemanly conduct at ath-
letic events. One aspect of this policy
is the requirement that:

“There be no public drinking at
any athletic event held on _ the
Washington and Lee campus.

“The underlying wisdom of this |
rule should be apparent to every |
student. At our home games many
friends and sponsors of the Uni-
versity are in attendance as well
as the general public.

“The cooperation of all students
in this matter is sincerely asked by |
the Executive Committee. This rule
will be enforced-—and violators may
be asked to withdraw from the Uni-
versity for a specific period of time.”

 

At Openings

University Dance Board President Jim Vann announced
today that the Four Freshmen, a popular singing group, has
been signed for the Opening Dance Set Concert in October.
Vann’s visit to New York last june resulted in the signing of the
contract with the International Artists Corporation who manage

 

Goodwyn To Be
Administration
Committeeman

Warren Goodwyn, senior law stu-
dent from Montgomery, Ala., has
been appointed to represent the stu-
dent body on the Administrative
Committee of the University. Good-
wyn’s appointment was made by the
Executive Committee of the Student
Body.

As an undergraduate, Goodwyn
was president of the SAE House,
battalion commander in the ROTC,
and a Distinguished Military Stu-
dent. He has served on the Exec-
utive Committee for three years, and
is presently on the law school board
of governors. Last spring he served
on the Steering Committee of the
1960 Mock Democratic Convention.

Succeeds Abeloff

Succeeding Bill Abeloff as the sec-
ond student to hold this position,
Goodwyn will attend all meetings of
the Administrative Committee. This
group is responsible for the hand-
ling of most cases involving stu-
dent discipline and absence viola-
tions.

Although he has no vote, Good-
wyn will have the privilege of the
floor to express himself on all mat-
ters. Through him, the student body
will be able to voice its opinions to
the committee.

The requirements for this posi-
tion include the student’s being well
acquainted with W&L affairs, and
being a recognized school leader.

Danforth Asks

For Seniors’

Applications

The Danforth Foundation, an edu-
cational Foundation located in St.
Louis, Mo., invites applications for
the tenth class (1961) of Danforth
Graduate Fellows from college sen-
ior men and recent graduates who
are preparing themselves for a career
of college teaching, and are planning
to enter graduate school in Septem-
ber, 1961, for their first year of
graduate study. The Foundation
welcomes applicants from the areas
of Natural and Biological Sciences,
Social Sciences, Humanities and all
fields of specialization to be found
in the undergraduate college.

President Fred C. Cole has named
Mr. James D. Farrar as the Liaison
Officer to nominate to the Danforth
Foundation two or not to exceed
three candidates for these 191 fellow-
ships. These appointments are funda-
mentally “a relationship of encour-
agement” throughout the years of

the quartet.

The Four Freshmen will appear
at Washington and Lee on Oct. 29
for the concert Saturday afternoon
of the Dance Set.

Vann says, “The reputation of this
singing group is an adequate testa-
ment to the calibre of their enter-
tainment. It is the sincere wish of
the University Dance Board that the
Washington and Lee Student Body
respond accordingly by doing their
part to make the Dance Set a suc-
cess.”

Some of the popular albums of the
Four Freshmen include “Four Fresh-
men, Five Saxes,” “Voices in Love”
and “Four Freshmen and Five
Trumpets.” They include such hits
as “I’m always Chasing Rainbows,”
“Tll Remember April,” “Warm,”
“This Can’t Be Love,” “Sometimes
I'm Happy,” “In the Still of the
Night,” “Got a Date With an Angel,”
and “Give Me the Simple Life.”

“Voices Are Instruments”

Capitol Records, for whom the
Four Freshmen record, has this to
say of the group.

“Because their voices, individually
and collectively, are so agreeably
listenable, it takes a while to real-
ize that the Freshmen use them as
though they were instruments.

As a happy consequence, they are
able to carry off complicated, un-
orthodox arrangements that are un-
hampered by the threadbare idioms
of commonplace vocalizing. This
unique facility stems from the quar-
tet’s musical grounding, formidable
technique, and boldly imaginative
concepts. One result of their vocal
innovations is a growing list of
highly successful albums.”

An article about the Four Fresh-
men that is on the back of their
album, “Voices In Love,” says this
about the group:

“Whether generating a warm, full-
blooded atmosphere or moving into
the nostaglic groove, the Freshmen
blend perfectly with their back-
ground. And, no matter what the
tune, they display the openhearted-
ness that’s been their musical signa-
ture since the beginning.”

Though they handle their material
with assured suavity, the article
continues, there remains that pat-
ented Freshmen freshness of spirit
and idea. This ingenious craftsman-
ship has kept them leading popu-
larity polls for years. The group has
won the “Best Vocal Group” race
in Metronome and Down Beat polls
four straight years, and has led
the field in Billboard and Playboy
polls.

“Seldom has any vocal group
boasted more plentiful musical tal-
ents. Bob Flanigan handles the upper
vocal registers, plays trombone, and
doubles on bass. Don Barbour, the
second voice, plays guitar; his
brother Ross sings the third part and
plays both trumpet and drums. Ken
Alber rounds out the group, sing-
ing bass and blowing trumpet and
mellophone.

Lest We Forget The Social Fraternity

We herald the “New Era.” We support the new program
of promises. We endorse the trends in academic life at Washing-
ton and Lee.

Yet, we champion the propagation of the social Greek-letter
fraternity—not in an effort to protect it from accusations that
list it as a deterrant to progress—but because we know it to be
a necessary part of an education for which there is no substi-
tute. The accusations, though, are important and need to be
reviewed.

The statistics, as printed in last week’s Ring-tum Phi, illus-
trate its wane by marking a six per cent drop in fraternity
pledging this year as compared with last. Statistics, then, are
the first of the many foes to fraternity life.

Most scholars class fraternity activities as juvenile, and
fraternity pre-eminence as sacrilege to the academic tradition
of diligence, excellence, and advance.

Professors, conditioned to a way of life rooted in dedication,
see fraternity life as a stagnant, damaging complex of mixed
orientation to ruin the potential of a student.

Many parents view fraternity life as that element of evil
which inflicts their son with moral regret. Fraternities are also
cursed because they are responsible for barbaric “hell week”’
ceremonies, corrupt campus politics, academic and athletic
apathy, as well as the unneessary excess expenditures of a col-
lege education. They are accused of promoting atheism, dis-
crimination, and alcoholism.

These are a small proportion of the many accusations made
against fraternities. Many of them are well-founded and rele-
vant, but in fraternity life the examples of such malignancy
are the exception rather than the rule.

The college fraternity is an institution, and like every in-
stitution its idealogy is hampered with misconceptions and im-
perfections. This is true of a university, a church or any other
such ways of life.

The decline of the Greek-letter fraternity is a national
reality. They are being denied their individuality and right of
selection as well as being nearly or completely annihilated on
many of the nation’s campuses. More and more the role they
play in the drama of college life is being eliminated or softened
to the extent that they occupy a portion of a dormitory or a
small house for occasional meetings and gatherings if they
exist at all.

With our eyes on the galaxies we must not limit our educa-
tional system to mere academic stimulus although this is essen-
tial and important. Man, or more specifically, a Washington
and Lee student, regardless of his academic prowess and I.Q,,
is a social being—sensitive to and for the feelings of his fellow
students and associates. The social education of a man should
not be neglected for it is through his relations with his fellows
that his life gains meaning and direction.

Why then are fraternities necessary at Washington and Lee?
We hold that they assume a necessary responsibility for which
there is no feasible substitutes—namely, the development of
social character.

Consider how a freshman arrives at Washington and Lee
a finished product of his home or prep school environment.
While in high school or away at prep school he has been under
the powerful influence of his parents or a regulatory system
which sought to develop his social character—restricting his
rebellious nature and fostering the qualities that are accepted
in society. The important point here is that there is an influence
at work to develop or promote social character.

We speak of social character not as a set of accepted be-
havior norms characterized by such terms as politeness, well-
manneredness, breeding, and the ability to mix well. These, of
course, are part of the spectrum of social character, but the
goal in character development is the ability to share relation-
ships with a fellow student in such a way as to contribute to
the well being of all parties concerned. So in the conjugal family
and even away at school, the potential freshman is, as a rule,
constantly pressured by this outside influence to seek social
development of character.

Now allow is to set up a hypothetical situation in which
Washington and Lee is “‘blessed’’ with the absence of fraternity
life and customs. The freshman would temporarily be sustained
by this Freshman Camp indoctrination, faculty counselors,
etc., into the traditions of Washington and Lee. This we feel
could never break down. Eventually, however, relationships
between freshmen would be, in a measure, shallow because
of the lack of upperclass interest and direction.

This upper class concern is most important in the life of
a freshman, even a sophomore. The trend, no matter the op-
position, is to conformity, and it is the new individual’s wish

undergraduate. So not only is there a force at work pressing
conformity, there is also a genuine desire to belong. This again
offers a means to social relationships and sound development of
these.

The freshman then under a “fraternity conscious” system,
has left behind at home or in school a strong developing force
only to enter another. With the Greek-letter fraternity exerting
both positive and negative pressure (or influence) upon an
individual, the individual is made to choose a course for his
social life and made ever aware of the fallacies and merits of
his choice.

Positive influence is that pressure which is condoned by
moral, ethical and aesthetic values. An example of this is the
brotherhood of men, and more specifically, the brotherhood of
students at W&L. Negative influence, often condemned as
disasterous, would be evidenced in the supposed tendancy for
fraternity brothers to lead an initiate into excessive and damag-
ing use of alcohol. Although we have said there is an element of
conformity in the student’s nature, there is also powerful free
will and individuality. Because of this, when confronted with
such negative pressure, the student may elect to protect himself
from it, and thereby his character is strengthened.

We hold then that the influence, positive or negative, ex-
erted by the fraternity upon a student is far superior than no
influence at all. Because social character is the result of develop-
ment and not accident, the fraternity makes an irreplaceable
contribution to the student and the university.

Washington and Lee needs the beneficial elements of fra-
ternity life to supplement the excellence sought in academics.
Without this moral and social conditioning that a student re-
ceives as a result of fraternity relationships, he would be ill-
prepared to meet post college life.

If re-organization or re-orientation is needed in fraternities
let it come. But we must never allow this institution to fade, for
it was founded and exists for a purpose greater than the per-
sonal whims of the individuals sharing in its way of life.

This purpose is brotherhood. Sir Walter Scott wrote: “The
race of mankind would perish did they cease to aid each other.
We cannot exist without mutual help. All therefore that need
aid have a right to ask it of their fellow-men; and no one

 

to conform to the sober and accepted character of the mature

who has the power of granting can refuse it without guilt.”

|'importance whether you were in

|at all for that matter—but it is of
| pyramount importance whether you
are admitted to the graduate, busi-
ness, or law school of your choice.

It is so very important that every
Washington and Lee student an-
alyze his own thoughts and goals
and be certain that he is oriented
in the proper direction and _ that
he is concentrating on that which
is of real, and not ephemeral value.
Personally, it is hard to conceive
of a more exciting time here at
Washington and Lee than to be be-
ginning an academic career.

Both the new president and the
new dean of the college are anx-
ious to promote and encourage aca-
demic excellence here on the cam-
| pus; and the high standards that

they are apparently setting for the

 

| university seem to have caught on
| throughout the faculty. There is a
new interest and excitement among
many of the faculty that has been
noticed by nearly all the returning
students, and at long last the day of
the ‘gentleman’s C’ has past. It is
no longer fashionable here at W&L
to emphasize the role of the ‘stud
horse’ or the blase southern dilet-
tante at the expense of studies, and
from all indications in the adminis-
tration, it is not only no longer fash-
ionable but also no longer to be
tolerated.

Emphasis has refreshingly shifted
from a cloying romanticism over the
southern past to an active faculty
and an alert student body. It is so
very important that every student
realize this change and shift his
thinking and action accordingly. Un-
derstand that this is not an atempt
to overdramatize the situation and
infer that the school has undergone
a complete revolution and that all
that we have loved and enjoyed here
has departed forever. Such is not
the intent at all. Rather, the purpose

 

Loyalty To Traditions Weakened By Rules

By MALCOLM BROWNLEE
Friday Columnist

The student body at Washington
and Lee is fortunate to have a num-
ber of traditions which are valued
by nearly all its members. But, as
is the case with most things that
are valued, it has been found that
these traditions must be guarded by
means of rules.

Such rules are necessary to pro-

tect the traditions from the few stu-'

dents who do not value them and,
in some cases from the students who
do value them.

That these rules are needed is
unfortunate. Not only do they show
that our traditions are not as strong
as we would like them to be, but
also they weaken the loyalty which
many students have to these tradi-
tions.

A student is less likely to be proud
of a tradition or to see its worth
if there is a rule governing his keep-
ing it. The responsibility of uphold-
ing a tradition is turned into the duty
of obeying a law and avoiding a
penalty.

Possibly this can be best observed

 

in regard to the tradition of attend-
ing classes, a tradition, not of Wash-
ington and Lee alone, but of college
life in general. Most students agree
that attending classes is valuable; yet
the faculty doubts that we value it
highly enough. Therefore, there are
rules governing our attendance.
These rules mean that even the stu-
dent who sees the value of classes
will often look at a class period
as something to endure in order to
avoid an “F” in the course.

Most Cherished

The honor system is probably the
most cherished of our traditions. Yet
even here rules and penalties are
necessary since there are a few stu-
dents who, for one reason or another,
will not adhere to the tradition. But
these rules weaken the honor in the
honor system, making it, in a cer-
tain respect, just another kind of
disciplinary system.

In another respect, however, the
honor system is genuinely based on
honor. Most freshmen soon lose their
initial fear of the system. For the
remainder of their student life if the
thought of cheating even enters their

minds, it is usually quickly dismissed.
In this is the strength of the honor
system.

As for conventional dress most
students consider it a good tradi-
tion though there are some who
question its worth. To make the
questioners conform, penalties are
necessary, especially in the spring.
Yet these penalties weaken the tra-
dition for those who value it high-
ly.

A new tradition seems to be aris-
ing: that is not to wear conventional
dress whenever there are no penal-
ties involved in not wearing it.
Among upperclassmen there were
no coats and ties to be seen during
the time preceding rush week.

Even more pertinent is the prob-
lem of the publicity office each year
during graduation week. If students
are not proud enough of a tradition
to display it when there are num-
erous visitors on campus, one must
raise serious doubts as to how
highly they value the tradition.

Speaking Tradition

The speaking tradition is possibly
the only one at Washington and Lee

 

which would exist without penalties
and which is not weakened by pen-
alties. No one fears being called
before the Assimilation Committee
for not speaking; no one would think
of reporting such a neglect. Yet
friendliness is a _ tradition which
every student practices.

Some freshmen have received the
wrong impression that the Varsity
Club has passed a rule requiring
them to attend this year’s home foot-
ball games. No such rule exists. The
statement made at freshman camp
was simply to the effect that fresh-
men are urged and expected to at-
tend home football games and that
the Varsity Club encourages such
attendance.

Still, there seems to be a _ possi-
bility that the Varsity Club along
with the Assimilation Committee
will try to get a rule passed requir-
ing attendance of freshmen at a
certain number of home games. Such
» rule, in our opinion, is highly un-
desirable. The Varsity Club’s ef-
forts to promote school spirit are
to be highly commended; but if this
rule is passed, the Club will be de-
feating its own purposes.

 

A rule will take away much of a
student’s pride in supporting the
team. All rules tend, in a certain
way, to weaken the tradition to
which they apply. Attendance at
football games has become a tra-
dition followed spiritedly by almost
the whole university. Let us not
weaken it by making it a require-
ment.

* * *

Also pertaining to football attend-
ance, the Dance Board has picked
the worst possible weekend for this
year’s Openings, the weekend when
the Generals meet Hampden-Sydney.
This is the closest of this fall’s away
games and many students would
normally attend it. But the game
will come on the same afternoon as
the concert, making it impossible for
students to attend both the game
and the most popular dance week-
end events. In addition there are the
hazards involved with drivers who
are tired from the night before.

It is probably too late to resche-
dule this fall’s dance, but this is a
request for a little more forethought
in scheduling future dance weekends.

 

 

of these words is to point out that
there has been a decided shift in
emphasis at the university, and the
factor of prime importance now is
not whether you are a fraternity man
or whether you are “ivy-leagued”
and “go down the road,” but whether
you can measure up to and contribute
to a standard of academic superiority
that will continue to grow more and

The handwriting is on the wall for
the “good time charlies,” and the
quicker this fact is perceived the
better off the student will be.

W &L Generals Take Aim At Centre’s Colonels

Booters Meet Pfeiffer
In Opener Here Monday

Coach Mac and
Team—Ready

Two years ago, Washington and
Lee’s Coach Lee McLaughlin looked
at the freshman-dominated varsity
squad and remarked, “There’s no
substitute for experience.”

Result— a 1-7-0 season that in-
cluded interesting football but few
victories.

Last year, McLaughlin looked
over his | sophomore-dominated
squad, and remarked, “There’s no
substitute for experience.”

Result—a 3-4-1 season that saw
even more interesting football, which
could have produced a 6-2-0 year
with the addition of just eight more
points in the right places.

Recently, Coach McLaughlin look-
ed over his junior-dominated foot-
ball team and remarked, this time
with a big smile, “There’s just no
substitute for experience.”

With a nine-game season opening
up tomorrow here  agzinst the
Prayin’ Colonels from Centre Col-
lege in Kentucky, Lee McLaughlin
feels his charges at last have the
experience to produce the winning
season he’s been seeking for four
long years.

“I think we should have a win-
ning year, although I don’t think
there’s a team on our schedule that
can’t take us,’ he declares. “But,
on the other hand, there’s not a
team our boys feel they can’t handle.
It’s a healthy attitude, one we've
had before, but this year we have
some of the people to back it up.”

Some of those people are 27 letter-
men and about a dozen promising
sophomores who will give the Gen-
erals three-deep strength in ability
and two-deep strength in experience
at every position.

No longer are there any freshmen
on W&L’s varsity football squad,
and the 1960 team is populated by
nine seniors and 15 sophomores.

Coach McLaughlin believes in
using lots of man power when it’s
available, so Centre’s prayin’ Colo-
nels can expect to see in the neigh-
borhood of some 40 Generals on the
field tomorrow afternoon, depending
on the W&L injury list.

“Last year I was able able to use
every man on my squad in the last
three ball games, and they were all
three close games,” explains Coach
McLaughlin. “I felt I could send any
boy I had in there and he’d do a good
job for me. I hope to be able to do
the same thing tomorrow.”

McLaughlin’s successful “Go-T”
offense will again be in use this year
as it was last year. Under this sys-
tem the left half operates as a regu-
lar T-formation halfback part of the
time and as a single-wing tailback
on other occasions. This offense al-
lows the use of three different units
interchangeably, which in turn gives
greater depth to the team.

Perhaps the best indication of how
the coaches and the team feel is
this statement by Coach McLaughlin:
“The boys honestly feel there isn’t
a team on the schedule they can’t
beat, and I feel that if we could

But it’s hard to keep a team oper-
ating at peak efficiency, both phys-
ically and psychologically. I will say
one thing—our boys are tired of
losing, they want to win, and I
think they will win some.”
Generals to watch Saturday in-
clude halfback Bobby Funkhouser,
the State’s second-ranked scorer last
year with 64 points; linebacker Ter-
ry Fohs, the Generals’ 145-lb. de-
fensive specialist; and quarterback
Steve Suttle, the team’s top rusher
last year with 263 net yards.
Opening against Centre in 1959,
Washington and Lee surprised them
with a 45-8 rout. Funkhouser scored
three touchdowns, Fohs led individ-
ual defenders with 14 tackles, and
Suttle directed four scoring marches.
Coach McLaughlin is hoping that
his observation on winning football
holds true on Saturday. Like he
says,
“There’s no substitute for exper-
ience.”

Cross-Country
Starts Monday
Against Pfeiffer

By JOHN ALLGOOD

The W&L cross-country team, al-
ready in “remarkable” pre-season
shape, opens its season Monday after-
noon against Pfeiffer College here at
2:45.

Coach Dick Miller, who was all
smiles after watching his harriers
turn in very fast time trials Thurs-
d-y, would not make any predic-
tions about Monday’s meet, but said
that Pfeiffer was weak in cross-
country.

“We beat Pfeiffer pretty badly last
year on a rainy day on a flat course.
Running here will be even toucher
for them because we have one of the
toughest cross-country courses in
the South.”

In 1959, W&L topped Pfeiffer, 19-
39, which was only four points off
a perfect 15-point score.

Heading the team are last year’s
one-two men, sophomores Mike
Shank and Stoney Duffey. Other re-
turning lettermen are Captain Holt
Merchant, the team’s only senior;
junior Allen Curran, and sophomore
Lewis Jones.

Two track lettermen, Craig Distel-
horst and Ed Garretson, who both
ran the two-mile event last season,
join the cross-country ranks this
year.

Coach Miller named Mike Brumby,
Bob Williams, Bruce MacDonald,
and Norm Youngblood as his most
promising freshmen.

The harriers, who chalked up a
5-4 record and finished seventh in
the state meet last year, lost only
one of its top seven men, Captain
Bill Loeffler.

“We have a promise of being
stronger this year, but a lot de-
pends on the freshmen,” Coach Mil-
ler said.

After Pfeiffer, the cross-country
team travels to Randolph-Macon
Oct. 3 and then tackles Hampden-
Sydney here Oct. 8 in what Coach

(Continued on page 4)

 

Washington and Lee University’s
soccer team, second best in the
state last year, opens its 1960 season
here Monday against Pfeiffer Col-
lege of North Carolina.

The ragged, but potentially strong
varsity squad opened its season un-
officially last Wednesday with a
a scrimmage against VMI.

The Generals managed to tally
three times while holding the Key-
dets to one goal. A great deal of
credit must begiven to the VMI
soccer club, however, since soccer is
not an Institute sponsored sport.

The W&L scoring opened on a
cross pass from Jim Starkey to left
wing Wick Hollingshead who tipped
the ball past the goalie. This goal
was scored in the first five minutes
of play.

Later in the contest the varsity
again scored, this time on a pass
from Chuck Beggs to Steve Hawk-
ins. This was a well executed play
on the part of Beggs who set up
Hawkins with a head ball.

Flaws were found in the W&L
team, and VMI scored on a fine
shot from 20 yards out into the up-
per right-hand corner of the net.

The Generals came back in fine
style, recovering admirably, and
found scoring range again when
Steve Hawkins got his second goal
of the afternoon. This was a power-
ful shot for which the VMI goalie
had no chance. This also concluded
the scoring in the match.

The varsity missed many passes
and set-ups which accounts for the
use of the word “ragged” in the
opening paragraph. Still, it was the
team’s first encounter of the season
and there is still time to iron out
the mistakes before meeting Pfeiffer
College on Monday.

As far as apparent strength goes,
Coach Lyles has nine lettermen back
from the 1959 squad which won five,
lost three, and tied one in regular
season play. The Generals also won
three, and lost twice to state cham-
pion Lynchburg College in the first
state intercollegiate tournament.

 

He MG OB. Be Be He He Me ae ate ste sta ate site te she she ae the ste ste

At present, Coach Lyles is work-
ing with a squad of 25 upperclass-
men and a dozen freshmen. Of the
freshmen, the top candidates appear
to be Breck Alexander, Peter Alford
Clem Clarke, Whit Fitzpatrick,
Tom Green, and Tain Tomp-
kins. Coach Lyles indicates that he
will use these six in Monday’s var-
sity action.

Center forward Dave Knight and
halfback Frank Smith, the team
co-captains, heed up the strong
nucleus of veterans. Other letter-
men include Charlie Begg, Dunlop
Ecker, Mike Keating, Bill Outman,
Bob Pagano, Steve Paley, and Jim
Starkey.

Coach Lyles says he thinks he has
two “sleepers” in wing men Steve
Hawkins and Wick Hollingshead,
who won letters in 1957 and 1958,
but who sat out last season.

Coach Lyles was pleased by the
aggressiveness and willingness dis-
played by every member of the
squad. He stated that if the boys con-
tinue to work hard, then formidable
opposition will not seem so formid-
able once the Generals take the field.

Honor System And
Trial Methods Explained

(Continued from page 1)

option of withdrawing from school
before trial or who has been found
guilty in an Executive Committee
trial is accompanied at all times by
two members of the E.C. until de-
parture from Lexington. This prac-
tice is maintained for the benefit
of the accused as well as that of the
entire student body.

The penalty for a violation of the
Honor System is sharp and irre-
pealable dismissal from the univer-
sity. This penalty is administered
by the 12-man Executive Commit-
tee only in those cases in which the
prosecutor, chosen from the E.C.,
has shown (beyond a _ reasonable
doubt) that the evidence supports
a breach of the Honor System.

The Executive Committee asks the
students to realize that the utmost
secrecy must be employed in the
investigation of alleged honor vio- |
lations—secrecy for the benefit of |
the guilty as well as the innocent.
