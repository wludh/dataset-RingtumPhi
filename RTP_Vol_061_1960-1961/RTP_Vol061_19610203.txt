Two Professors Are Named
To Municipal Board Posts

Two professors at Washington and
Lee have been appointed to munici-
pal bodies in the town of Lexington.

the Town School Board, and Henry
L. Ravenhorst, associated professor
of engineering, was appointed to the
town planning commission.

Dr. Griffith has been active in

Next week’s renewal of Interna-!
tional Relations Week at Washington
and Lee will mark the seventh an-
niversary of the event.

The speakers for 1961’s “Week”
will be Norman Thomas, who will
deliver an address entitled “An
American Socialist Views the East-
West Conflict” on Tuesday evening;
Dr. Malcolm Moos, recently speech-
writer to President Eisenhower, who
will speak on “The Presidency and
Foreign Affairs,’ on Wednesday eve-
ning, and Dr. Abraham Kreuzler,
Chairman of the Department of Rus-
sian Studies at Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College, who will conclude
the series with a lecture on “The
True Nature of the Russian Chal-
lenge,” on Thursday.

The inaugural IR Week at W&L,
in 1955, featured the Ambassadors
to the United States of Spain, Fin-
land, and India, and _ Professor
Charles A. Micaud, of the University
of Virginia, a specialist in French
affairs. These speakers emphasized
differed in points of view on issues
then current in international affairs
by discussing the positions of their
respective countries.

Lectures on Wilson

The sophomore year of the pro-
gram coincided with the nation-wide
celebration of the centennial anni-
versary of Woodrow Wilson’s birth.
This celebration set the theme for
International Relations Week in 1956,
as lectures on Wilson’s work were
delivered by Professor D. F. Flem-
ing, of Vanderbilt, a former direct-
or of the Woodrow Wilson Founda-
tion, and Professor Ralph Purcell,
of Sweet Briar. Both these lectures
were later published, and Professor
Fleming’s lecture, delivered in Lex-
ington, was used by the United States
Department of State in Voice of
America broadcasts.

The 1957 edition of IR Week stress-
ed the impact of American policy on
Asian and Iron-Curtain countries.
Speakers in this program were Pro-
fessors Edward Hallett Carr, Robert
Koblitz, and Milan Habala, the lat-
ter of Sweet Briar College. Profes-
sor Carr also gave three lectures on
historical subjects while on the
campus, and the lecture he gave
in the IR Week program was pub-
lished as part of the introductory
material of the fifth volume of his
History of Soviet Russia.

Professor Toynbee’s lecture was

Noted Historian

 

In 1959 Mr. Walter Millis, long-»
time writer for the New York Her-
ald-Tribune and distinguished his-
torian, spoke on “The Irrationality
of War.” His speech was an exposi-
tion of the “minimum deterrence
thesis”—the idea that in the present
power struggle it is not necessary for
either side to have enough strength
to gain victory in war if its purpose
is to prevent war. Rather, it is ar-
gued, a nation can prevent war by
making its potential enemy know that
its certain retaliatory capacity is so
great that the enemy will not dare
undertake war. Philip Jessup, then
Hamilton Fish Professor of Interna-
tional Law at Columbia University
but recently appointed judge of the
International Court of Justice, spoke
on “Current Problems in American
Foreign Policy.” Michael Mora, Gen-
eral Manager of the Norfolk Port
Authority, spoke on the European
Common Market and its probable in-
fluence on foreign trade of the United
States.

Last Year’s Theme

Last year International Relations
Week was developed around the
theme, “the United States and Un-
derdeveloped Countries.” The Hon-
orable Paul Hoffman, Managing Di-
rector of the United Nations Special
Fund and former Chairman of the
Studebaker Corporation, gave an
address entitled “Interdependence:
Fact and Opportunity.” Dr. George
Stolintz, who is Professor of Eco-
nomics at the University of Indiana.
spoke on world population move-
ments and their meaning. And Lt.
Colonel Amos A. Jordan, who is
Professor of Social Sciences at the
United States Military Academy,
lectured on United States Military
Assistance to the Underveloped
Countries.

sponsored by the School of Com-
merce and Administration and the

Pres Rowe To Do 6-Month Tour Of Duty In Army;
Three Students To Work With Information Service

Three students have been named
by the Information Services of Wash-
ington and Lee University to help
with new work for the second se-
mester.

George Honts, John Allgood, and
Bill Young are to assume some of the
activities of assistant director A.
Prescott Rowe, beginning Feb. 23.

They will work under the super-
vision of Frank A. Parsons, director
of Information Services.

Rowe, a 1960 graduate of W&L and
former editor of the Ring-tum Phi,
is taking a leave of absence from his
post to serve a six-month tour of
duty in the U.S. Army.

Rowe is a native of Fredericks-
burg, Va. and had worked with the
Free-Lance Star prior to his coming
here.

George Honts, a Delt junior from
Eagle Rock, Va., has been named
special assistant. His duties will in-
clude most of the regular news work
done by Rowe. Honts is managing
editor of the Friday Ring-tum Phi.
During the past summer he was a
member of the news staff of the Clif-
ton Forge, Va., Daily Review. He was

 

Automatic Suspends 32

The Committee on the Automa-
tic Rule has announced the with-
drawal of 34 students from the uni-
versity because of academic failure.
This total is a sharp contrast to
the multitude of rumors floating
around the campus.

Included in this total were 22
freshmen and 10 upperclassmen.
There were two students who failed
to make a “C” average probation.

The Committee is composed of the
president of the university and the
deans of the arts and sciences school,
the commerce school, and the law

associated with the Information Serv-
ices during the past semester.

John Allgood, a freshman from
Charlotte, N. C., will assume a po-
sition of assistant in the sports de-
partment. He is assistant sports edi-
tor of the Friday Ring-tum Phi and
has been employed by the Charlotte
Observer as a sports writer.

Phillips’ Report
To Be Published

A critique of the Landis Report
by Dr. Charles F. Phillips, Jr., as-
sistant professor of economics at
Washington and Lee University, will
be published in the Feb. 2 issue of
Public Utilities Fortnightly.

The article entitled “The Landis
Report: Boon or Bane?” is being
published at the request of the edi-
tors of the national journal. It is
a summary and evaluation of James
M. Landis’s recent report concern-
ing the United States’ independent
regulatory commissions.

Public Utilities Fortnightly is dis-
tributed to management personnel
and college libraries.

“The Landis Report is a careful
analysis of current regulatory prob-
lems which minimizes certain im-
portant, recent developments in the
competitive relationships of regu-
lated industries and which ignores
an opportunity to make a real con-
tribution in areas where public pol-
icy has lagged for too long,” Dr.
Phillips writes. “Less, not more,
bureaucracy and political interfer-
ence must be the starting point if
regulation in the United States is to
be improved.”

Dr. Flournoy as Shakespeare

Professor Fitzgerald Flournoy;

A Credit To Oxford And W&L,
As Well As Court of St. James

By GEORGE HONTS
Managing Editor

A week ago tonight the old Globe
Theatre came to life again at the
1961 Fancy Dress Ball. The dance
set, led by Don Partington, was a re-
ensctment of the presentation of the
Lord Chamberlain Players to King
James I of England.

Adding a note of authenticity and
color to the pageant was the appear-
ance of Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy in
the role of William Shakespeare.

Perhaps no one but Dr. Flournoy
could have given such a perform-
ance. A Rhodes Scholar, Dr. Flour-
noy is a Shakespeare student and
teaches a year-long course in the
plays of Shakespeare. His deep voice,
with a trace of old English added,
announced the participants in the
set in a matter that attracted the
attention of the audience and that
needed no mechanical aids. It was,
in the estimation of most of those
who witnessed the set, the most im-
impressive presentation in recent
times.

Born in Richmond
Flournoy was born in Rich-
near the turn of the

Dr.
mond, Va.,

century. He received a B.A. degree
from Washington and Lee in 1920
and a M.A. degree in 1921. He con-

ceiving a BA degree with honors
there in 1924. In 1938 he earned a
M.A. degree from Oxford. He com-
pleted his education with a Ph.D.
from Yale University in 1936.

Dr. Flournoy was an instructor at
Stanford University in 1925-26 and
was appointed to the Washington and
Lee faculty in 1926. He was pro-
moted to the position of professor of
English at Washington and Lee in
1937.

His college activities include mem-
bership in Phi Kappa Psi social fra-
ternity, Omicron Delta Kappa, Phi
Beta Kappa and Sigma Rho. Dr.
Flournoy was the editor and the
founder of State Orator’s Medal. He

Dr. Flournoy is the son of the late

International Relations Week

The International Relations

day might prove to be one of the most stimulating and signifi-

cant events of this academic year

for dicussion of vital importance, but the speakers are men
of considerable prominence in their fields.

Foreign diplomacy is perhaps the most crucial theme in
American politics today. It’s only suitable that the 1961 IRC
week be concerned with American diplomacy, and as in the|j
past, present the student body with a provocative and meaning: | |

ful program.

The renowned socialist leader Norman Thomas and noted
republican Malcolm Moos, champions of two contrasting ideal-
ogies, will indeed provide the incentive for a week comparable
to the highly successful IRC program n 1958. That year this

campus highly acclaimed Dr.

Larson, like Moos, an Eisenhower speech writer who was ac-
knowledged as the chief apologist of ‘Modern Republicanism.”

At that time the student body c

in an effort to hear these exponents of varying points of view
and the enthusiasm was difficult to parallel. Again this year,
we anticipate an overwhelming reception for the noted speakers.

Dr. Abraham Kreusler, an

affairs, will treat post-Stalinist developments in Russia compli-
menting the discussions of Thomas and Moos.

We urge all faculty members and students to take part in
the events of next week. Opportunities such as this are rare
and everyone who does not participate in some or all of these
events is denying himself the occasion for exciting and timely
discussions on topics which ultimately affect each of us.

Dr. Gunn and the International Relations Club are to be
commended for making this opportunity possible for us.

Vann Attends Conference;
Impressed With West Point

By JAMES VANN
Friday Columnist
‘feller, Dean Rusk, Gen. Courtland

One of the highlights of my col-
lege experience occurred last De-
cember when, to-
gether with Pierce
Hardwick I rep-
resented Washing-
ton and Lee at
the annual Stu-
dent Conference
on United States
Affairs held at
West Point.

Not only did the
conference provide
intellectual stimu-
lation and _ chal-
lenge, but also it gave us an op-
portunity to meet with and exchange
ideas with students from all the
better colleges in North America.

The conference was set up sev-
eral years ago with the purpose in
mind of enabling students from out-
standing intellectual communities to
meet together with high ranking of-
ficals in the United States Foreign
Office, and thereby gain some ap-
preciation of the magnitude and
complexity of our present interna-
tional situation.

The various delegates were di-
vided into panels, each of which
was headed by some scholar or
soldier who had risen to the na-
tional fore in his field. In these
panels delegates were to study a
particular aspect of United States
policy and come up with recom-
mendations on the feasibility of
these suggestions.

 

My own pannel was on the At-
lantic Community, and was headed
by Dr. Ruth Lawson of Mt. Holyoke,
a recognized expert on European in-
tegration.

Our research and study centered,
for the most part, around the NATO
alliance: and our conclusions were
directed primarily towards the more
rapid realization of a united and
militarily self-sustaining Europe. To-
gether with me on the panel was Col.
Richard Stillwell, a member of the
Draper Commission, and _ students
from Rutgers, Sarah Lawrence,
Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Bryn
Mawr, Amherst, and the University
of Ottawa.

In addition to the work that was
done in the panels, the atmosphere
was further stimulated by conven-
tions that were held each evening at
which the delegates attended en
mass. Among the speakers at these
larger meetings were Nelson Rocke-

 

Schuyler, and J. J. Lindsay of the
Washington Post. These men usual-
ly spoke on controversial aspects
of the foreign policy and in addition
to contradicting each other, their
talks were always followed by live-
ly debates from the floor.

Aside from the obvious advant-
ages that accrue from participat-
ing in a conference such as this,
I was delighted by the opportuni-
ity of seeing at first hand the Mil-
itery Academy. And here I can
offer nothing but praise. The en-
tire week of meetings were under
the supervision of the Military
Cadets, and things ran without a
hitch. Not only was everything co-
ordinated perfectly, but there was
nothing ommitted for the dele-
gate’s comfort and convenience.

Together with their thoroughness
and efficiency, the student body of
West Point also presented itself
as an extremely well-informed and
intellectually acute group of stu-
dents. I sat in on a history class
while I was there and was very
much impressed not only by the
teacher, a Ph.D. from Harvard and
the author of several books, but also
by the interest of the students.

I have previously regarded the
Academy as having little or no in-
tellectual atmosphere with all its
emphasis on the football team and
Peter Dawkins. I have come to have
a sincere respect for the students and
a genuine admiration for what they
stand.

In conclusion I would like to say
that this is, as can be seen from my
own reactions, a fine way to sell your
school and student body to others.

New Rates Offered

The Homestead, in Hot Springs,
Va., announced today that a special

  

 

By VICTOR LASSETER
Friday Columnist

There has always been a strong
tradition of iconoclasm in American
humor, but with
the coming of the
television set and
the long-playing
record you can
now enjoy icono-
clasm in your own
living room.

The growth of
the mass media
has __ fortunately
a : been paralleled by
Lasse a growth in the

sane popularity of the
new iconoclasts: Bob Newhart, Nich-
ols-May, and Mort Sahl.

 

 

Sahl, a young Canadian of Jew-
ish descent, is (among the new
comedians) perhaps the most se-
vere critic of the American scene.
He is more properly described as
an iconoclast or nihilist. He says,
for instance, that he is “not so
much interested in politics as in
overthrowing the government.”

Sahl reached a zenith in popular-
ity this summer when he was the
subject of a cover story in Time
magazine. He is often seen on fami-

 

Every year about this time two!
articles are run in the Ring-tum Phi
which always rate
a groan_‘ifrom
everyone except
the authors. The
first one appeared

last week (the
yearly picture his-
tory of Fancy;

Dress in stunning
black and white),
and the second is
the annual Hell
Week editorial.

To my _ mind
these two articles should be com-
bined and published several times
a year. That way we could have
“The Semi-Annual Picture History
of the Week after Fancy Dress, Com-
plete with Comments, Letters, and
Bloody Pictures.”

Craven

If this plan for consolidating the
articles is carried through, I can
foresee a trend which might revo-
lutionize both time-honored insti-
tutions. Fancy Dress could become
Hell Week!

Consider the history of Fancy
Dress. It was started to relieve the
boredom of mid-winter in Lexing-
ton by the dear old school librarian,
Miss Annie Jo White. Each year
it has grown and grown, until it

But let’s face it, since that peak
Fancy Dress has been on the de-
cline, and we've been forced to
spend more money to entertain less
people. No longer will Life consider
coming to Fancy Dress. On the other
hand, Hell Week was also begun as
a relief from boredom, and it too
has increased until it was investi-
gated (on the west coast) by Look’s
counterpart on those shores, Life
Magazine. There is no information
about possible radio and TV cover-
age of that scandal.

At any rate, both institutions are
the cause of some concern among
faculty and student body. The facul-
ty wants to abolish Hell Week, and
the Dance Board wants to perk up
Fancy Dress. Fancy Dress could real-
ly be a hell of a better week if
the two were joined. Think of the

ly television programs, but here his
sharp tongue is usually stifled by
demands of sponsors and producers.
On the last Steve Allen show, how-
ever, Sahl did make an excellent,
un-censored appearance. He took his
material from the U-2 episode. Pres-
dent Eisenhower, he said, seemed
to be taking a feminine role in the
cold war. After the latest Krushchev
tirade, Eisenhower would rush into
Hagerty’s office and ask: “has he
called yet?”

Sahl is at his best in night-club
performances, many of which have
been recorded on LP’s. Taking a
theme for discussion, “eggheads in
government,” for instance, Sahl be-
gins his staccato-like attacks. His
targets: the DA.R., the Edsel,
coffeehouses, the A.M.A., and poli-
ticians.

The A.M.A. became one of his
favorite targets after a California
doctor once charged him an exorbi-
tant fee for an appendectomy. Sahl
is particularly fond of psychoanal-
ysts. He talks about their willingness
to cooperate with patients, to refer
them to other analysists. “They call
it motivational-rehabilitation-thera-
py. I know... we call it fee-spliting,

songs, freshmen eating eggs, actives

All of this would be the good
college fun that harks back to the
days of Miss White. And all the
time and money that is saved
could go into other worthy chan-
nels for the overall improvement

racks, imported stale liver, things
like that).

satirist. In his “eggheads in gov-
ernment” monologue he discusses
the controversy over sending Nix-
on or Stevenson as a good-will
ambassador around the world.
Nixon, Sahl says, was offered sev-
eral countries of his own, but he
refused because “he’d have to go
on television and explain to the
president.”

Sahl is nominally a Democrat. He
has spoken at several fund-raising
dinners for the Democrats and has
refused to do the same for the Re-
publicans. His satire, however, is
usually directed at the party in pow-
er. As he explained on a recent tel-
evision debate with Steve Allen,
“Kennedy is the President-elect,
Nixon is the President-reject.”

Sahl was concerned about the lack
of a political conscience among his
colleagues in night-clubs and on
television. The nation elected its
youngest president by the closest
vote in years, and no other comedian
objected. As Sahl says, “Kennedy
promised the country everything;
and he gave us his brother.”

Morton Sahl became a comedian
after an abortive attempt at graduate
business school in Los Angeles. He
got his start at the “Hungry I” in

Intellectual Interest Cited:
Sale Of Used Texts Indicative
Of A Student’s Academic Neglect

By MALCOLM BROWNLEE
Friday Columnist

Intellectualism and anti-intellec-
tualism have been subjects much dis-
cussed during the
current school
year. A columnist
in this paper at
the start of last
semester voiced
the opinion that
Dr. Cole has is-
sued in a new era
and that merely
striving for a
s Oe gentleman’s “C” is
Brownlee a thing of the

past. But another
columnist around Thanksgiving said
that Washington and Lee has no
right to call itself a liberal-arts uni-
versity and that a spirit of anti-
intellectualism prevails on our cam-
pus.

Usually I have sided with those
who believe that most students in
the university have genuine intel-
lectual interests. There are very few
students who try to get through
school with a minimum of effort in
the easiest courses and who have no
interest whatever in the knowledge
gained from their courses. A large
number of students take as elec-
tives courses reputed to be hard
but beneficial, although I will grant
that there are also many students
enrolled in courses which have a
reputation of being easy and of lit-
tle intellectual benefit to the stu-
dents taking them.

My faith in the intellect of our
student body is shaken, however, at
the end of each semester when I
see students waiting to sell their
textbooks for a fraction of what they
paid for them. To sell a course

textbook seems to me to be evidence
that neither the course or the text
will have much lasting value for
the student.

Most of the knowledge acquired
during a semester will be forgotten,
and textbooks provide a means of
renewing this knowledge quickly.
They are convenient source material
for future reference. A student who
sells his textbooks admits that he
learned little from the books or that
what he learned does not mean much.

The prices paid at the bookstore
indicate that some students’ evalua-
tion of their texts is very low in-
deed. A book for which the student
paid $7.00 may sell for 90c. A $5.00
book may bring 75c. A student who
considers what the money received
from the books (or the money whose
lack caused him to sell the books)
was spent for will probably ban
something about the position of in-
tellectual interests on his scale of
values.

I would like to say in parentheses
that it is possible that even an in-

dent encounters some courses and
texts which mean little to him. The
services of the book store for such
cases is not adequate. According to
Jim Sumner the present arrange-
ment is the most adequate of those
he has considered, although he him-
self is not satisfied with it. I urge
further investigation of possible im-
provements in this area. The pos-
sibility of the book store itself buy-
ing and selling second-hand books
might be considered though this
would admittedly involve complica-
tions.

But it is inconceivable that stu-

terests will want to sell eight or ten
books as some students are doing
each semseter. The fault lies not in
the book store, which seems to be
searching for ways of improving this
particular service, but in students
courses to give up the price of a
who are not interested enough in
their courses to give up the price of

LP Records & Television Enable
Americans To Enjoy Iconoclasm

| San Francisco. His topic was Mc-
Carthyism, but his monologue was
almost unsuccessful. The manager
of the “Hungry I” hired him on the
basis of his last joke. Sahl was com-
menting on the famous Eisenhower
jacket. “There ought to be a Mc-
Carthy jacket,’ he said, with “a
strap to go over your mouth.”

Today Sahl earns more than
$300,000 a year. His original au-
dience of Southern California col-
lege students now includes Adlai
Stevenson and President Kennedy,
who borrowed some of Sahl’s jokes
during the presidential campaign.

Sahl’s future plans include a net-
work show of his own, where he can
enjoy the same freedom as he has in
night clubs. He intends to get such
a show by building up a large audi-
ence which enjoys his iconoclasm in
its undiluted form. If Sahl gets his
television program, he will have an
audience that a H. L. Mencken or a
Will Rogers could never enjoy.
Sahl’s penetrating wit and perception
would be a welcome antidote to the
television opiate of Dinah Shore and
Perry Como, and to the senseless
ubiquity of Westerns and detective
programs.

R-t-Phi Subscriptions

Many outstanding events will take
place during the Spring term on
the W&L campus. To mention only
a few: International Relations Week,
The Phi Beta Kappa assembly, ODK
selections, the SIPA convention, ten-
nis, lacrosse, baseball, intramural
events, and Spring and Final dances.
These and many other events are
covered by and preserved in the two
weekly editions of the Ring-tum
Phi.

Realizing how hard it is for us,
here at school, to keep those at home
informed, the Ring-tum Phi would
like to offer a special rate of $2.50
for the balance of the semester in
order that parents, friends, alumni
and any incoming freshmen may be
kept in closer contact with the
school.

We would encourage you to send
in your subscription as soon as pos-
sible in order that all the second
semester issues be sent. We will be
glad to include back issues as long
as they hold out. Everyone certainly
should spend 10 cents an issue to
keep his parents and others informed
on the school.

The attached form may be filled
out and mailed to Box 899, Lexing-
ton, Va., or it may be given to either
Huntley Biggs—SAE or Pete Age-
lasto—Phi Kappa Psi. The payment
of $2.50 may be made now or a
bill could be sent to your parents.

The meet will be conducted on an
event basis and no team scores will
be kept.

Captain Jim Hickey, the South
Boston “speedster,” who posted a
0:06.3 in the 60-yard dash last
year, has the best chance of plac-
ing for the Generals. Hickey and
sophomores Tom Edwards and
Dave Munroe are the only return-
ing lettermen on this year’s squad.

Edwards will compete in the broad
jump and Munroe will enter the shot
put competition. Freshman Robin
Kell is W&L’s other entrant in the
field events. He will participate in
the high jump.

In the individual running events,
freshman Fox Urquhart will join
Hickey in the 60-yard dash and
freshman John Pearson will run the
70-yard high hurdles.

W&L will enter two teams in

GENERALS FACE HAMPDEN-SYDNEY SATURDAY

 

Return Of The ‘Killer’ Ups W&L Chances
Of Winning First Away Game In Two Years

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Sports Editor

“Killer” Kowalski returns to action
tomorrow night just in time to give
the Generals an added punch that
might snap their 14-game road losing
streak.

Kowalski, sidelined since Christ-
mas with a bad knee, probably will
not start but will see plenty of ac-
tion against Hampden-Sydney’s fast-
breaking Tigers tomorrow night at
Hampden-Sydney.

The return of the “Killer,” who
has a 10.7 scoring average, should
help take up the scoring slack
created by the loss of 6-7 fresh-
man center John McDowell.

Coach Bob McHenry plans to start
6-4 sophomore Jack Culley at cen-
ter against Hampden-Sydney. But
McHenry also has planned some new
offensive patterns for the Tigers.

“We may use a 3-2 offense part of
the game for a change of pace. I
don’t especially like the 3-2, but it
is good for driving in because it
leaves the middle open. Its drawback
is that it hurts our rebounding
strength,’ McHenry said.

A second new offense that Mc-
Henry is contemplating for use
against smaller teams like H-S and

* Lynchburg is to have W&L come up

the court in a 3-2 and then put
Kowalski in the middle.

“Kowalski is a good man inside,
but we can only use this offense
against small teams because of the
height factor,’ McHenry said.

McHenry scouted Hampden-Syd-
ney Wednesday night as they lost to
Roanoke, 102-90. The W&L coach’s
only comment on the Tigers’ play:

“They can score!”

Score indeed. The Tigers are
averaging 75 points per game so
far. Washington and Lee has passed
the 75-point mark only twice this
year. Once when it beat Hampden-
Sydney, 79-67, at Lexington and the
other time was a 78-56 win over
Sewanee.

Hampden-Sydney put four men in
double figures in its loss to W&L—
Norwood Davis, 15; Bill Hardin, 14;
Butch Cox, 13; and Dave Wilson, 10.
But the Tigers lost Wilson, who

| sparked them to their upset win over
| Randolph-Macon at Ashland, at the
| semester break because of academic
| troubles.

Still the Tigers are like a pack
of racehorses when it comes to scor-
|ing. Their main drawback has been
a so-so defense which has been un-
| able to contain even their weakest
opponents.

| McHenry’s main worry now is
| getting the team into shape for the
'H-S game after a two-week layoff.

13 Despite Snow

Despite any lingering snow or ice Washington and Lee’s
spring football practice will begin February 13.

Lee McLaughlin emphasized that
spring practice was not limited to
varsity and freshmen football play-
ers.

Coach McLaughlin announced

Prospects for next year look
bright. The Generals lose only nine
men of their 1960 squad which
posted an 8-0-1 record and should
get some help from the 1960 fresh-
man team, which was termed one of
the best frosh teams in recent years.

Three players—Dave Grogan, Dick

“Because of the blisters, we haven’t

what kind of shape we’ll be in Sat-

McHenry’s strategy for Hampden-
Sydney’s fast-break is a controlled
offense.

Law Association

To Meet Feb. 25

The Washington and Lee Law
School Association will hold its next
meeting on February 25 in Tucker
Hall. During this meeting a schedule
of future activities will be discussed.
The group is composed of lawyers
who are alumni of either the W&L
undergraduate or Law Schools.

The purpose of the association is
to enlighten and encourage the in-
terest of the alumni in the instruc-
tional programs of the School of
Law of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity.

The association was founded in
1953 with an initial enrollment of
112 members. It has grown steadily
since then to its present member-
ship of 500.

Several of the past projects of the
association include sponsorship of the
Moot Court Competition, additions to
the law library, a law internship
program during the summer, and
the establishment of a “Law Day.”

The annual meeting of the asso-
ciation will be held during the
Tucker Lectures (April 21 and 22).

“| DON'T THINK THERE’S ANY END
TO THE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS BUSINESS"

When Gene Segin got his B.S. in Business Ad-
ministration at the University of Illinois, he was
in touch with 8 prospective employers.

Gene joined Illinois Bell Telephone Company
because: “The people I talked to here made it
very clear that I would not be shuffled into some
narrow specialized job. I thought this job offered
the greatest opportunity for broad experience.”

On his first assignment Gene was sent to Spring-
field where he conducted courses in human rela-
tions for management people.

His next move was to a traffic operations job
in Rock Island. On this assignment he was in
charge of all personnel who are directly responsible
for handling telephone calls in this heavily popu-

lated area. Here

Gene earned a reputation for

sound judgment and skill in working with people.
He was promoted to Traffic Supervisor.

 

 

 

 

Frederick R. Kappel, President

American Telephone & Telegraph Co.

 

 

 

Today, Gene’s chief responsibilities are in man-
agement training and development, and company-
union relations. The latter includes contract bar-
gaining and helping settle labor disputes.

How does Gene feel about his job? “It’s a real
challenge. I’m in some of the most vital and in-
teresting work in the country.” And about the
future—“Well there aren’t any pushover jobs
around here. It’s tough. But if a man has what it
takes, 1 don’t think there’s any end to the oppor-

tunity in this business.”

* *

*

If you're looking for a job with no ceiling on it—a job
where you're limited only by how much responsibility
you can take and how well you can handle it—then
you'll want to visit your Placement Office for literature
and additional information on the Bell Companies.

“Our number one aim is to have in all
management jobs the most vital, intelli-
