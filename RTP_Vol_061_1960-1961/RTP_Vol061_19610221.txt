Competition For Mahan Awards
Opened By English Department

The English department has an-
nounced the 1961 competition for
the Mahan awards in creative writ-
ing. The awards were established
under the will of George A. Mahan,
a Washington and Lee alumnus, who
died in 1936.

There are four prose awards; two
for freshmen and one each for soph-
omores and juniors. There is one
verse award open to members of the
freshman, sophomore, or junior class-
es. The awards offer the recipient $60
in cash or a $100 remission in fees for
the coming year.

The prose entries may be either
literary criticism, plays of one act
or longer, short stories, or informal
essays. Purely factual prose is un-
acceptable. Each prose entry must
consist of at least 1500 words. How-
ever, several short selections total-
ing 1500 words are acceptable.

The verse selection must total at
least 30 lines and may include more
than one piece.

The deadline for entries in the
competition is technically March 25,
the day before spring vacation be-
gins. But Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy,
professor of English, said that entries
would be accepted by any member
of the department of English on the
first day of classes following the
vacation, thus permitting students to
work on entries during that period.

Each entry will be judged by the
entire English department. No stu-
dent may submit more than two prose
entries and one verse entry.

 

Phi Beta Kappa
Plans Initiation

By TOM LYBASS

The Virginia Gamma Chapter of
Phi Beta Kappa celebrates its fif-
tieth anniversary April 12. Dr. How-
ard Lowry, noted scholar and presi-
dent of the College of Wooster in
Wooster, Ohio, will deliver the prin-
cipal address in Lee Chapel in com-
memoration of the founding of the
W&L Phi Beta Kappa Chapter in
1911.

During the exercise, newly elected
members to Phi Beta Kappa also will
be honored. Following Dr. Lowry’s
address, the new members will be
initiated in the Student Union Build-
ing in a private ceremony. A cele-
bration dinner will be held in the
Evans Dining Hall. In addition to
the present members of the Virginia
Gamma Chapter, there will be some
thirty or forty alumni of the chapter
participating in the ceremony.

Dr. Lowry has had a long and
distinguished career as a scholar and
educator. After receiving his Ph.D.
from Yale University in 1931, he
taught English literature at Wooster
and Princeton University until he
became president of Wooster.

As a scholar, Dr. Howard Lowry’s
special interest is Matthew Arnold,

 

Victorian poet and critic of litera~ | i

ture, politics, and religion. In 1932
Lowry’s editing of the letters of |
Arnold and Arthur Hugh Clough, |
another Victorian poet, stimulated a |
revival of interest in the life of
Arnold.

Since that time, Dr. Lowry has
published an edition of Arnold’s|
notebooks, a commentary on Ar-
nold’s poems, and a collection of
poems of Clough. Dr. Sidney Coul-
ling of the W&L English depart-
ment, who teaches a course in Vic-
torian Literature, praised Lowry for
his pioneer work in the study of
Arnold. Dr. Coulling, in evaluating
Dr. Lowry’s achievement, said, “Few
scholars have done so much for Vic-
torian letters.”

Each entrant must choose a pen-
name to identify his entry. All en-
tries must be typewritten and pledg-
ed as usual, Students desiring fur-
ther information on the competition ;
should consult with any member of
the English department.

“This is a fine chance for anyone
with ambition in the field of creative
writing to win a little money, and
get a little fame. And it’s good prac-
tice, of course,” said Dr. Flournoy.

Last year’s winners of the Mahan
awards in prose were sophomore
Steve Henry, juniors Scott Iacone
and Mac McClung, and senior Mal
Brownlee. The poetry award went
to sophomore Chester P. White, Jr.

New Regulations Passed

Summer School Is Discouraged

In an effort to decrease the amount
of summer school work taken at
other institutions to make up aca-
demic deficiencies at Washington and
Lee, the faculty has passed new
regulations which will apply in the
future beginning with the present
freshman class, Dean William W.
Pusey III announced today. The rules
for current sophomores and juniors
remain unchanged, as outlined in
the 1960 Catalogue (pages 57-58, 147).

As in the past, approval will only
be given for summer work done at
an institution of the same general
academic standards as Washington

 

and Lee. A list of institutions ap-
proved for summer school work is
available from department heads,
Dean Pusey, or Dean Adams.

The new regulations are as fol-
lows:

No more than 12 semester hours
of summer school work may be
offered. This total of 12 may be
comprised of any combination of
the following: (a) Free electives,
3-12 hours; (b) Not more than two
required semester courses (for the
first time), which may not be in
the major subject, in the School of

 

Shenandoah To Feature 17 Poets

Works by 17 young American poetsthe poetry of Witter Bynner, one

will be featured in the forthcoming
Winter issue of Shenandoah, Wash-
ington and Lee’s literary review.

Among poets whose works will ap-
pear in the quarterly volume are
John Pym, Joan LaBombard, Tracy
Thompson, Emilie Glen and Charles
E. Eaton.

Critiques by two Washington and |
Lee English instructors will set the |
tone for the predominantly poetic |
volume. Douglas Day will examine |

 

of several young poets who were
contemporaries of D. H. Lawrence,
and James Boatright will review
Donald Allen’s anthology entitled
“New American Poetry: 1945-60.”
Two modern short stories will
round out the volume. “Off Duty”
by a Washington and Jefferson Eng-
lish professor, Edwin Moseley, and
“Has Aanyone Seen This Horseman”
by David Bunch of St. Louis will be

course is repeated in summer
school for the purpose of raising

the old as well as the new grade
will be used in calculating the stu-
dent’s grade-point ratio.

All students must secure approval
of the institution to be attended and
of courses to be taken in person be-
fore leaving the campus. Approval
of the institution is secured from
Dean Pusey or Dean Adams as ap-
propriate. Approval of courses in
Accounting, Commerce, Economics,
and Political Science is secured from
Dean Adams. Approval of other
courses is secured from heads of de-
partments offering the correspond-
ing work at Washington and Lee. It
is the responsibility of the student
to see that the transfer credit is
sent to the Registrar.

 

Exceptions to the regulations can
be made only by the Committee on|
Courses and Degrees. Dean Pusey }
pointed out that these would only:
be made in case of students who}
could demonstrate that they wish to
take additional work in order to ac-
celerate their college studies.

Arizona Conservative Io Discuss

Federal Aid In

Education

By Richard Cruse

Senator Barry M. Goldwater, Republican of Arizona, will
deliver a public address on Wednesday evening March 1 in
Lee Chapel. Scheduled for 7:30 p.m., his speech is expected
to dwell on the question of federal aid to education, touching
on a three point program which he introduced in the Senate

‘Kaleidoscope’ To Alternate
With New Radio Program
Featuring Troub Drama

The Washington and Lee Trouba-
dours will present the first in a new
series of radio dramas on Radio
Washington and Lee on Thursday
evening, March 2. The first play of
the series will be “They Knew What
They Wanted” by Sidney Howard.
The play won a Pulitzer Prize in 1936
and has more recently been adapted
into the musical “Most Happy Fella.”

The program series is titled Retro-
spect and will be presented as a part
of the Kaleidoscope program on a
bi-weekly basis beginning on the
23rd. The first program will be a full
fifty-five minute performance begin-
ning at 8:05 on WREL. Subsequent
programs in the series will be heard
at 8:30, following a shortened Kaleid-
oscope broadcast.

The producer of Kaleidoscope and
Retrospect programs is Bob Holley,
and the first director of the Retro-
spect series will be Mervin Clay.

Future Retrospect broadcast will
present some of the greatest radio
dramas and plays of the past. The
Troubadours will be featured in pro-
duction, direction and acting roles of
the series.

The series of Radio Washington
and Lee programs is presented each
night, Monday through Friday, at
8:05 p.m. on WREL. It presents pro-
grams of classical, popular and jazz
music in addition to the Kaleidoscope
programs on Thursdays. Harvey Al-
len is Executive Director of the
series.

Glee Club Plans
Busy ’61 Season

The Longwood College Choir and
a 19-piece orchestra will perform
with the Washington and Lee Glee

 

: Club on March 19 in a presentation

of Faure’s “Requiem” at the Lex-
ington Presbyterian Church.
Selections from “The Messiah” will
also be done at this special spring
concert. Mr. Robert Stewart will con-
duct the combined groups in “Re-

| quiem” with Dr. John Molnar of

Longwood conducting the selections

Troub Play Is Psychological | from Handel.

Tragedy Of 11th Century |

!

The drama of Luigi Pirandello is
concerned with the separate realities |
of individuals, with the private in-
ner worlds men know as themselves. :
In each of these worlds, one man'
consciously or unconsciously stores’

his hopes and his feelings. The world,

in turn, defines for that man his own |
personality, with its own set of rules. !

Out of this theme Pirandello built |
a dramatic literature persistently
ironic. “Henry IV,” a tragedy, con-
cerns the moment when a man breaks
from his conscious retreat into the |
splendor of eleventh century history |
which has become, over a period of
years, real for him.

The visit to this castle of Henry’s
original love and her lover both of
whom Henry has not seen since his
madness began, provides the dramatic
impetus upon which the play builds
to its frenzied climax. Matilda, once
beguiling, now appears at the court
an elderly woman pursuing in vain
the “fading image of her youth.”
Belcredi, her lover, hides himself
behind a cynical mask, hurting
everyone he fears might touch him
in a vulnerable spot.

Built around the reincarnated
eleventh century, colorful, intriguing,
and of course ironic, “Henry IV” is
a play which discusses a major prob-
lem on the contemporary scene—the
individual’s drive to deal honestly
with himself and retain at the same
time his ability to communicate with
his fellows.

 

W&L’s musical highlight of the
spring season, the annual Spring
Concert, will be given by the Glee
Club with the Westhampton College
Glee Club on April 26, and will fea-
ture Brahms’ “Liebeslider Waltzes.”
Both groups will also present the
outstanding numbers from their own
repertoires.

During three recording sessions
this spring, the Glee Club will cut
a record to be released next fall. It
will feature Handel’s “Hallelujah
Chorus” and selected Christmas car-
ols, plus Randall Thompson’s “Ta-
rantella” and other selections from
the Glee Club’s 1961 repertoire.

Professor E. F. Turner and Mark
Gee are the recording engineers for

| this undertaking. Mr. Stewart said

that he feels this year’s club is the
first one he has directed which has
the balance and quality to make a
recording.

Featured with the Glee Club in its
concerts will be a small, specialized
group, the “Capperales,” who will
sing their own arrangements of sev-
eral well-known popular hits.

On May 2 the entire club will be-
gin a two-day tour to Richmond,
where they will repeat their spring
concert at the University of Rich-
mond plus several other perform-
ances in Richmond schools.

They will then go north for a day
of concerts in Wilmington, Del., cul-
minated by a special informal con- |
cert sponsored by W&L alumni in|}
Wilmington.

yesterday afternoon as a substitute for President Kennedy’s
®education bill.

His appearance on campus is un-
der the sponsorship of the Wash-
ington and Lee chapter of Pi Sigma
Alpha, national honorary political
science fraternity.

One of the most articulate con-
servative spokesman of our time,
Senator Goldwater has read widely
in the field of political theory from
Aristotle and Cicero to Jefferson,
Lincoln, Wilson, and Theodore
Roosevelt. His philosophy of govern-
ment as revealed in his best selling
book, The Conscience of a Conser-
vative, is substantially as that ex-
pressed by President Jefferson in
his first inaugural:

A wise and frugal government,
which shall restrain men from in-
juring one another, shall leave
them otherwise free to regulate
their own pursuits of industry and
improvement, and shall not take
from the mouth of labor the bread
it has earned: this is the sum of
good government, and this is
necessary to close the circle of our
felicities.

Born in Phoenix in 1909, and edu-
cated at Staunton Military Academy
and the University of Arizona, the
Senator began his political career
some forty years later when he was
elected to the first of two terms in
the Phoenix city council on a re-
form ticket. He led his seven-man
slate on balloting each time.

In 1950, he served as campaign
manager for Republican Howard
Pyle’s successful bid for the gover-
norship of Arizona. In 1952, he ran
against and defeated the Democratic
majority leader of the United States
Senate, Ernest McFarland.

Only once previously in its history
had Arizona elected a Republican to
the Senate. In 1958, when the Dem-
ocrats unseated 13 Republican sena-
tors, all defenders of the Eisenhower
administration’s record, Senator
Goldwater attacking major adminis-
tration policies, defeated Arizona’s
most popular Democrat, the then
Governor Ernest McFarland.

In the Senate, Goldwater is a mem-
ber of the following committees:
Public Labor and Welfare, Interior
and Insular Affairs, and the Select
Committee on Improper Activities in
the Labor or Management Field.
From January 1955 until February
1956 he was chairman of the Repub-
lican Senatorial Campaign Commit-
tee. He was re-elected to this post in
1959 and again in 1961.

Senator Goldwater is active in a
variety of activities of non-political
nature. He is a brigadier general in
the U.S. Air Force Reserve, an ex-
pert on Indian matters, an associate
of the Royal Photographic Society of
London, and a devotee of Dixieland
music. He has explored every sec-
tion of the Grand Canyon, once dis-
covering an unknown natural bridge.

 

Fishwick Is Lenten S peaker

Dr. Marshall W. Fishwick, profes-
sor of American studies at Washing-
ton and Lee University, will be the
first to appear in the special Episco-
pal Lenten series of speakers at the

THE RING-TUM PHI

The Other Side

Mr. Morison’s speech to the ODK Assembly Thursday
will stand as one of the most memorable we’ve heard since we’ve
been here. Too many speakers to such a large assembly content
themselves with uttering stale platitudes or clothing their argu-
ment in such an ambiguous vocabulary that one is hard-pressed
to decide just what they were saying, or whether they really be-

live in it.

Mr. Morison is passionately opposed to the conserva-
tive—or “conformist,” as he called it—way in which Virginia
has been governed. We must agree that the doctrinaire conser-
vatism of many of our Southern leaders is inadequate to cope
with problems presented by the fast-changing economic and
social makeup of America in the 20th Century.

It is useful to say generally that conservatives are people who
think that government is inherently bad, or at best neutral in
effect, and should therefore be held to a minimum. By the same
token, liberals are people who think that government can, and

should be, a positive force.

Virginia and some other Southern states are just about the
last stronghold of the people who believe in minimal govern-
ment. They are finding that many powers, in education, par-
ticularly, that are best exercised at the state or local level, are
being taken up by a federal government committed to a positive
role. This is being done against a background of election returns
which leave one in the dark as to what the people of the South

really want.

We will never know what the people of the South want until
a liberal party, in addition to the so-called moderates (who are
apparently just that, neither here nor there), arises to offer
Virginia and the South a choice. It is the fault of the Byrd or-
ganization in part that the liberals cannot be heard in Virginia.
That is Mr. Morison’s “conformity.” But it is also the fault of
the liberals. If there are so many people in Virginia who oppose
the principles of her government, why haven’t they stood up
and sounded off? That was Mr. Morison’s challenge.

We will be forced to oppose these liberals when and if they
stand up if they profess anything like the militant liberalism
prevalent among our more “progressive” northern neighbors.
For we believe their emphasis on economic, and thus politically
attractive, panaceas, is a betrayal of the true principles of Amer-

ican liberalism.

We are, and will remain, strong supporters of the present
political powers in Virginia. We feel that the Byrd organiza-
tion has given the people of Virginia what they have wanted

and what they have expected from their state government.

It is evident that the majority of voters in Virginia have been
satisfied with their government. Even Mr. Morison in his scath-
ing attack on the “Byrd Machine” admitted that the policies of
politics in Virginia for the past few decades have been “‘clean.”

We will always be skeptical of these messiahs who come into
Virginia, tell her people how and why they are being mistreated
at least from a political standpoint, and call upon them to rally
behind a banner of “progress,” “Liberalism,” and now “non-
conformity.” In most cases, these men have little constructive
criticism to offer. They quote lists of statistics which are invar-
iably answered by those in power with equally lengthy and im-

pressive lists.

These critics of conservatism fail to realize that the people of

Virginia have up until the present favored the so-called
“agrarian”’ policy in the state; that they are in favor of low taxes
and a sound fiscal policy; and that they have favored the candi-
dates who have offered them sound conservative government.

Colonel Wise: Last Of The Individualists —

By JOHN PAUL

One of the most lamented phe-
nomena of our society is the value
which we place upon conformity. A
realistic person must be careful
what he chooses to say. If one
chooses to stand other than with
the crowd one should at least take
the precaution to choose a noncon-
troversial subject to take a stand
upon. It was, therefore, a most re-
freshing experience to meet and talk
with one of the few controversial
figures remaining, Col. Jennings C.
Wise.

I approached Col. Wise’s den in the
Dutch Inn with some misgivings. His
appearance is indeed distinctive. His
gray hair and matching goatee are
accentuated by the great flowing
black bow tie he wears about his
neck. He is often seen carrying a
cane and wearing a long black cape.
In his lapel he wears the Distinguish-
ed Service Cross and the badge of
the French Legion of Honor.

My initial misgivings were over-
come, quite shortly however. I found
the Colonel to be courteous, affable,
and despite local legends to the con-
trary, somewhat modest. He struck
me as being the youngest octogenar-
ian I had ever met.

Col. Wise is a graduate of VMI and
the law school of the University of
Virginia. He at one time served as
professor and commandant at VMI.
Col. Wise revised the curriculum at
VMI under the guidance of Prof.
R. T. Ely of Ann Arbor, onetime
dean of American economics, and
Dr. John Latane of Johns Hopkins,
a graduate of W&L.

 

Although military science is not
the most popular course among W&L
students, it might be noted that
Col. Wise was the designer of the
original proponent of the R.O.T.C.
system.

Col. Wise has also made a name
for himself in the fields of law and
politics. He served as Assistant At-
torney General of the United States
during the Hoover administration.
One of his accomplishments at the
time was the correction of parcel
post rates. He reminisced that it re-
quired a legal struggle against the
lobby of the country’s greatest mail
order houses.

“In the end the rates were chang-
ed,” he said, “allowing for an in-
crease in the size of parcels, lower
rates for short hauls, and raised rates
for long hauls which saved the Post
Office Department 50 million dollars.”

We discussed the law generally and
then got on to another of the subjects
which the Colonel is deeply interest-
ed in at the present. The Colonel
shares the view that racial segrega-
tion is proper. He is contemptuous of
the decision requiring desegregation
in education.

“This isn’t the law,” he said refer-
ring to the ruling of the Supreme
Court, “it’s dogma. But when the
Supreme Court keeps repeating dog-
ma, the Congress and the people keep
going along with it until it finally
begins to look like law.”

“As for the Communists, they will
try to break down the existing order
by fanning strife and by infiltration.
Then, when we've sold our souls,”

A Review

 

By ED NORTON

Senator Goldwater has defined the
conservative philosophy as “a body
of ethical and social beliefs which
suggest that we should apply the wis-
dom of the past to the present and
future. Above all else the conser-
vative is dedicated to the preserva-
tion of the dignity of the individual.”

In his best selling book, The Con-
science of a Conservative, he elabo-
rates on this philosophy and applies
it to the major issues facing the
nation today.

“The Constitution,” says Gold-
water, “is a system of restraints
against the natural tendency of gov-
ernment to expand in the direction of
absolutism.” He argues, however, that
the system of restraints has become
ineffectual and that the increasing
power of the federal government is
dangerously threatening America’s
freedom.

In its economic operations, the
scope of its activities, and its in-
creasing interference in the lives

Webster Unabridged

 

By ED WEBSTER

Socially conscious commerce ma-
jors will be interested in the recent
exploits of one Nikolai Ladnov, a
Russian,

Ladnov, known as “the Don Juan
of Moscow,” used an accounting
ledger instead of a little black book.
Written in the ledger were the names,
addresses, and other statistics for
521 (yes, 521) women whom he had
met in one way or another.

Ladnov gave each woman a ser-

of individuals, the federal govern-
ment has become “a vast national
authority out of touch with the
people and out of their control.”

To illustrate what he believes to
be unwarranted interference by the
government in areas not specifically
designated by the Constitution Sen-
ator Goldwater points to several do-
mestic problems of today. He says
of the current controversy over states
rights and racial integration, “I be-
lieve that it is both wise and just
for the Negro children to attend the
same schools as whites, (but) I am
firmly convinced—not only that in-
tegrated schools are not required—
but that the Constitution does not
permit any interference in the field
of education.”

To other major issues such as the
farm problem, taxation, and govern-
ment welfare spending Senator God-
water applies the same reasoning.
The federal government is acting
beyond the power granted to it by

 

the Constitution and is encroaching

ial number. We can imagine him
coming home after a hard day at
the factory and sighing, “Boy, I'm
sure in the mood for A-36592-J
tonight!”

The amorous statistician also had
a file of love poems cross-indexed
with the names of the ledger.

Who said that free enterprise is
dead in Russia?

Speaking of free enterprise, we are

 

reminded of Donald Kamfwa, the

 

 

on the rights of the states, local
government, and individuals.

The solution to this problem of
unlimited power will come, he be-
lieves, only when we entrust the con-
duct of our affairs to men who un-
derstand that their first duty as pub-
lic officials is to divest themselves
of the power they have been given.

Although Senator Goldwater warns
of the danger to American freedom
presented by the power of federal
government, he emphasizes in The
Conscience of a Conservative the
danger of losing freedom by losing
the Cold War with the Soviet Union.
He argues that we have been on the
defensive too long, “that we have
sought settlements while the Com-
munists have sought victories, and
we have sought to pacify the world
while they have sought to win it.”

United States foreign policy, he
believes, should be based on tak-
ing the initiative against Commun-
ism, for before the world can have
peace, conditions must be ready
for it. “A tolerable peace must fol-

Kamfwa, 55, has nine wives and
68 children. He is hoping to top 100

On the local scene, a word of
congratulation is in order to Mr.
Graham Morison for his speech at
the ODK assembly.

The unusual length of the address
caused it to overshadow the tapping
of ODK members—perhaps justi-
fiably.

 

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

It may not be polite to criticize
invited speakers, but on the other
hand it is not polite for invited
speakers to subject captive audiences
to dull, tedious political diatribes.
However, politeness is only a mat-
ter of taste, and people differ on
that.

What was objectionable was hav-
ing to listen for one hour to an ill-
organized, pedestrian speech filled
with what seemed to be deliberately
misleading statistics.

Specifically: Mr. Morison discours-
ed lengthily on statistical compar-
ison of Virginia with the rest of
the United States. To make his point,
he selected only those statistics which
showed Virginia last or near the
bottom with the rest of the culprit
states of the South.

One of the most misleading was the

 

 

statistic which showed that workers

he said stroking his beard furiously,
“they'll have our country.”

One of the Colonel’s projects,
and he seems to have many, is to
encourage the building of a Memorial
Arch in Lexington “to commemorate
the Voluntary and More Perfect
Union of 1789 and the vanishing
rights of the States without which
the Republic cannot endure.”

On politics he further explained
himself saying, “I’m trying to make
both parties stand behind respon-
sible government. It doesn’t matter
what the name is, whether Demo-
erat or Republican.

“Now I’m trying to stop the radi-
cals from looting Virginia. People
damn me and try to cover facts
because they can’t believe that I
put the United States and Virginia
ahead of the name of a party.”

* Aa *

Another facet of Jennings C.
Wise’s career is the number of books
he has published. These include a
recently republished survey of Con-
federate artillery entitled The Long
Arm of Lee; a political study entitled
Woodrow Wilson, Desciple of Revo-
lution; a novel entitled On the Way
to Perignan; and a history of VMI
entitled Sunrise of the Virginia Mil-
itary Institute as a School of Arms:
Spawn of the Cincinnati.

Our library contains his Philosoph-
ic History of Civilization. This work
might be recommended for the his-
tory student who gets bored with
those dull, history texts. I myself
find it quite intriguing:

!in Virginia averaged a paycheck of
only $69.60 a week while their more
fortunate fellows in the rest of the
country did far better (I think the
figure was around $90.00 but am not
sure). The statistic which Mr. Mor-
ison forgot to mention was recently
released by the Gallup people. In
comparing the minimum weekly
amount necessary to support the
median family of four in various
areas around the country, it was
discovered that the figure for the
South was $66.00 while that for the
North was approximately $90.00. In
other words, although the Southerner
may earn less cash, he can buy as
much with the cash he does earn.

Mr. Morison also mentioned the
loss of several thousand farms over
certain periods, leaving his audi-
ence with a sort of subliminal im-
pression that whole parcels of land
were leaving Virginia (and going
North, one presumes).

 

“So vanishes the mystery of the
Cave Men, as also that of the

E-ski-Moo who are merely the
descents of those who continued

to survey the earth as messengers
of God’s House.

“But if in the post-diluvian cycle
of Shem-Ham-Japeth, the Eski-
moo were not the same as they are
today, neither were the so-called
cave men all brutal savages as
modern science depicts. Among
them as there has been in all ages,
were men of inspired enlighten-
ment—the true elders of mankind
corresponding to Japheth ‘the El-
der.’

“What became of the thousands
of caves in which the people of this
age survived in addition to the
crude ones presently known?

“The answer is a simple one. The
cities of the future arose upon
many of the caves which became
cellars and sub-cellars, such as the
catacombs beneath Pa-hi-si, Rome,
W-ar-sa-w and Ya-ru-si-loam.’

(page 169)

In regards to this book I remarked
to Colonel Wise that I found it
slightly confusing.

“Confusing?”, he asked incredul-
lously. “The only reason you find it
confusing is that you have been
taught history by the conventional
modes and texts. I have references
in there that are not found in the
encyclopedias. If you had studied the
texts I refer to in the bibliography
you wouldn’t have been confused.”

He added, “The purpose of the

Morison Knocks Virginia’s Conformity,
Slices Byrd, Laments Fall Of Norfolk

Most misleading but most amus-
ing of all was the tragic story of the
Fall of Norfolk. To hear Mr. Mor-
ison tell it, New York was only a
fishing village in those days, and all
Viriginia had to do was build a rail-
road and they’d have it made. Of
course just what was going to be
shipped in and out of Virginia aside
from tobacco and cotton he didn’t
say and doesn’t know. Unfortunately,
Harry Byrd wasn’t in power then,
so he can’t be blamed for that. I
suppose it was the same element that
caused Buena Vista’s failure to sur-
pass Pittsburgh as a steel producing
city.

In the first part of his speech, Mr.
Morison delivered the Annual ODK
Attack on Conformity. I’m sure his
listeners were prepared to settle back
on that one. But Mr. Morison, in his
subtle way, used conformity as a
springboard for his attack on Sena-
tor Byrd and his friends. Mr. Byrd,
he proclaimed, was a conformist, as
were his friends and supporters. We
have all heard how bad conformists
are, so, so much for the Byrd Ma-
chine.

But what is a conformist? One who
does something simply because near-
ly everyone else is doing it. Senator
Byrd and his friends are certainly
not following the lead of everyone
else but are doing the leading. Mr.
Morison may not like where they are
going (presumably he likes it better
than Tennessee) but he can hardly
call leadership conformity.

If Mr. Morrison does not like con-
servatism, that is his privilege, and
if he wishes to tell us why, that, too,
is his privilege. But that is what
he should be doing instead of badger-
ing us with his tawdry collection of
statistics and his singular under-
standing of history.

 

 

‘Conscience Of A Conservative’

low victory over Communism.”

He leaves two choices to Ameri-
cans. “Either the Communists will
retain the offensive; will invite us
in local crisis after local crisis to
choose between all our war and lim-
ited retreat; and will force us, ulti-
mately, to surrender or accept war
under the most disadvantageous cir-
cumstances. Or we will summon the
will and means for taking the initia-
tive and wage a war of attrition
against them—and hope, thereby, to
bring about the internal disintegra-
tion of the Communist empire. One
course runs the risk of war and
leads in any case, to probable defeat.
The other runs the risk of war and
leads to possible victory.”

Senator Goldwater denies the
liberal accusations that his domestic
policies show no concern for human
welfare, or that his foreign policy
is widely isolated. He maintains that
the Conservative philosophy will
meet with what he considers the
greatest challenge of the day, “to
preserve and extend freedom.”

Notes On Nikolai Ladnov, Don Kamfwa, Morison

What we were hearing, apparently,
was one of the few point-blank ex-
pressions of concern over Virginia
that any prominent Virginian has
dared to express. Mr. Morison also,
we may assume, would like to have
his name remembered in the up-
coming gubernatorial or senatorial
races.

It is not often that W&L gets a
chance to hear a speech of this
calibre. Mr. Morison honored the
school by choosing to present it
here. Unfortunately, the impatience
and indifference of the audience
were all too evident.

Spontaneous applause greeted Mr.
Morison in several places in the lat-
ter part of his speech. His comments
on the Lynchburg mess, however,
were received gingerly. As usual,
W&L allied itself safely on the side
of law and order, and fell into sil-
ence when Mr. Morison condoned
the goals that the six jailed students
had been seeking.

* * *

In general, the student body has
been interested in the tempest in
Lynchburg, but no one has cared to
go out on a limb. A group of student
protesters at a local church got cold
feet at the last minute. A couple of
seniors went down and chatted with
the minister who’s at the core of the
ruckus, and even bought two “white”
tickets so that the two old Negro
women could fox the color line at the
Passion Play. But all this happened
sub rosa.

Although no banner-wavers have
arisen at W&L, there does seem to be,
for once, a healthy interest in an is-
sue of some importance.

W &L Falls To Roanoke, Catholic;
Fauber Holds Usual Top Form

The Washington and Lee Generals,
after their resounding victory over
the University of Virginia, lost to the
Maroons of Roanoke College last
Wednesday night by a score of 77-63.
Although Rodger Fauber was the
high scorer of both teams, the Gen-
erals could not hit from the floor in
competition with the Roanoke school.

The Maroons got off to an early
lead by making a layup shot imme-
diately after the opening buzzer.
Then Roanoke piled up a quick 26-10
margin with 11:31 left in the first
half. By intermission they had in-
creased their lead to 46-33. From
then on throughout the second half,
the coasting was easy.

The W&L scorers were having an
off night. Fauber with his 21 points
was high scorer, with Bill Ide fol-
lowing with 13 points. Brett Thacks-
ton, usually scoring up with Fauber,
sunk only 10 during the night.

At one time it seemed that the
Generals were having a surge of
power to overcome the Maroons.
With 4:45 left in the second half
and the score standing at 71-53, the
Generals made 10 baskets to increase
their score to 77-63. However, time
ran out for the Blue and White and
the final score stood at 77-63.

W&L 68, Catholic, 91;

W&L’s basketball team finished
out the home season on a losing note,
bowing to Catholic University, of
Washington, D.C., last Friday night,
by a 91-68 score. The Generals took
an early lead, but the Cardinals
caught up late in the first half, lead
35-32 at the half, and pulled away
in the second half for the win.

The Generals hit 38 per cent of
their shots from the floor, but
Catholic hit with an amazing 52.6
per cent. Most of the Cardinals’
goals came in the second half.
when they unleashed a devastating
fast break which accounted for
many of their 26 goals. For the
game, they hit 40 of 76 attempts,
while the Generals succeeded on
only 31 of 80. From the foul lines,
The Generals were 7 for 16, while
the Cardinals had 11 in the same
number of attempis.

In individual statistics, Catholic’s
Gene Horan led all scorers with 30
points. W&L’s Rodger Fauber was
second with 19. Brett Thackston and
Bill Ide added 12 and 10 respectively
for the Generals. Besides Horan,
Catholic had three other scorers in
double figures.

In rebounding, the Cardinals
had 55 compared to 44 for W&L.
Jack Spenser and Walt Skinner got
12 for the Generals, Fauber added
ten more to W&L’s total.

The Generals’ record is now 7-10,
equaling last season’s final total. They
close out their season tonight with
a game against Emory & Henry, a
team they beat earlier this season
in Lexington.

Washington and Lee’s wrestling
team was denied its seventh consecu-
tive victory Thursday night by a
27-2 defeat handed to the Generals
by a strong West Virginia squad.
This loss leaves the Generals with
a 6-3 mark with one match remain-
ing on the schedule. The season’s
finale will be next Monday as W&L
takes on the Wahoos of Virginia on
the Generals home mats.

Captain Sandy Mersereau picked

Thinclads Preparing For Spring Season
Robrecht To Fight Thursday Night

VMI Meet Shows Team'
Strength and Weakness

Coach Lord’s track team is busily
getting into shape these days for
the fast approaching outdoor season
which is a scant 6 weeks away. Un-
til clement weather the team will
share the fieldhouse with the Key-
dets, also in training.

Winter sports and spring football
practice, containing several even-
tual members of the thin-clad squads,
can be blamed for the relatively
shorthanded practice at this time.
The harriers taking their daily work-
outs now are primarily concentrating
on conditioning. Indoor meets are
sparse for the W&L squad, but
enough to give some of the neophytes
a taste of college track.

Last Saturday the Generals com-
peted in the Virginia Indoor Track
Championship meet at the VMI field-
house, running against such formi-
dable opponents as VMI, Va. Tech,
Virginia, and William and Mary. The
Generals scored in both the Fresh-
man and Senior Divisions. The two
freshmen scorers were Rob Kell,
clearing 510” in the High Jump,
and John Pearson, snatching a fifth
in the 70 yard Low Hurdles. Ship
Essex, another freshman, placed
fifth in the Senior Division 440
yard dash, turning in a very respect-
able time of :53.7. His trial time was
a better :53.6. Returning letterman
Jim Hickey rounded out the Gen-
eral scoring column with a fourth
in a tightly contested 60 yard dash.

When asked about the team pros-
pects for the coming season Coach
Lord showed his usual optimism,
predicting a good season, barring
injuries, etc. The record book will
support the ability of Mr. Lord’s
prognosticating powers, showing
nearly two years of barely blemished
seasons. The Coach expressed regret
over the loss of some of last year’s

quartermilers Bunkley, and Blakes-
lee, and other regulars lost through
graduation or transfer. But Lord ex-
pects strong replacement support
from Essex in the middle distances,
and from freshmen Jansen, Croft, and
Pearson in the hurdles.

The next opportunity for the thin-
clads to show their strength will be
in a meet with High Point College
run here on March 17.

Ray Robrecht Washington and Lee
University’s individual boxing team,
returns to the ring Thursday night
in Roanoke’s National Guard Armory
at 8:30.

Southpaw Robrecht, who has not
fought since last spring, will meet
Claude Bice of the Quantico Ma-
rines in a middleweight bout. Ro-
brecht will fight as a member of the
Roanoke Police Athletic League
team.

Bice and Robrecht fought on the
same card in Roanoke last spring
when Robrecht decisioned Quantico’s
Allen Hansen and Bice stopped a
Roanoke P.A.L. middleweight.

In his five years as a member of
the Roanoke P.A.L. team, Robrecht,
a native of Plainfield, N. J., has
achieved a 5-0 record. His career
record is 8-0 with three knockouts.

The highlight of Robrecht’s young
career was his winning of the novice
division middleweight title of the Vir-
ginia Golden Gloves in March, 1959.
In the title match Robrecht stopped
ex-Marine Bill Fleishman of Cov-
ington with a second-round TKO.

Robrecht became interested in
boxing only six years ago when he
started working out in the Plainfield
YMCA in order to keep in shape.

“T went to the YMCA just to keep
in shape,” Robrecht said, “but before
I knew it I became seriously inter-
ested in boxing.”

“l’VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU”

I know all of you have important things to do in the morning—
like getting down to breakfast before your roommate eats all
the marmalade—so you really cannot be blamed for not keeping
up with all the news in the morning papers. In today’s column,
therefore, I have prepared a run-up of news highlights from
campuses the country over.

SOUTHERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY

Dr. Willard Hale Sigafoos, head of the department of anthro-
pology at Southern Reserve University, and internationally
known as an authority on primitive peoples, returned yesterday
from a four-year scientific expedition to the headwaters of the
Amazon River. Among the many interesting mementos of his
journey is his own head, shrunk to the size of a kumquat. He
refused to reveal how his head shrinking was accomplished.
“That’s for me to know and you to find out,” he said with a
tiny, but saucy grin.

NORTHERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY

Dr. Mandrill Gibbon, head of the department of zoology at
Northern Reserve University, and known to young and old for
his work on primates, announced yesterday that he had re-
ceived a grant of $80,000,000 for a twelve-year study to deter-
mine precisely how much fun there is in a barrel of monkeys.

Whatever the results of Dr. Gibbon’s researches, this much
is already known: What's more fun than a barrel of monkeys is

  

a pack of Marlboro. There is zest and cheer in every puff,
delight in every draw, content and well-being in every fleecy,
flavorful cloudlet. And what’s more, this merriest of cigarettes
comes to you both in soft pack and flip-top box wherever cig-
arettes are sold at prices that do no violence to the slimmest of
purses. So why don’t you settle back soon and enjoy Marlboro,
the filtered cigarette with the unfiltered taste.

EASTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY
The annual meeting of the American Philological Institute,
held last week at Eastern Reserve University, was enlivened
by the reading of two divergent monographs concerning the
origins of early Gothic “runes,” as letters of primitive alphabets
are called.

Dr. Tristram Lathrop Spleen, famed far and wide as the dis-
coverer of the High German Consonant Shift, read a paper in
which he traced the origins of the Old Wendish rune “pt”
(pronounced “krahtz’’) to the middle Lettie rune “gr” (pro-
nounced “‘albert’’). On the other hand, Dr. Richard Cummer-
bund Twonkey, who, as the whole world knows, translated
“The Pajama Game” into Middle High Bactrian, contended
in his paper that the Old Wendish rune “pt” derives from the
Low Erse rune “mf’’ (pronounced ‘gr’’).

Well, sir the discussion grew so heated that Dr. Twonkey
finally asked Dr. Spleen if he would like to step into the gym-
nasium and put on the gloves. Dr. Spleen accepted the chal-
lenge promptly, but the contest was never held because there
were no gloves in the gymnasium that would fit Dr. Twonkey.

(The reader is doubtless finding this hard to believe as
Eastern Reserve University is celebrated the length and breadth
of the land for the size of its glove collection. However, the
reader is asked to remember that Dr. Twonkey has extraor-
dinarily small hands and arms. In fact, he spent the last
war working in a small-arms plant, where he received two
Navy “E” Awards and was widely hailed as a “manly little
chap.’’) © 1961 Max Shulman

R-t-Phi Subscriptions

Many outstanding events will take
place during the Spring term on
the W&L campus. To mention only
a few: International Relations Week,
The Phi Beta Kappa assembly, ODK
selections, the SIPA convention, ten-
nis, lacrosse, baseball, intramural
events, and Spring and Final dances.
These and many other events are
covered by and preserved in the two
weekly editions of the Ring-tum
Phi.

Realizing how hard it is for us,
here at school, to keep those at home
informed, the Ring-tum Phi would
like to offer a special rate of $2.50
for the balance of the semester in
order that parents, friends, alumni
and any incoming freshmen may be
kept in closer contact with the
school.

We would encourage you to send
in your subscription as soon as pos-
sible in order that all the second
semester issues be sent. We will be
glad to include back issues as long
as they hold out. Everyone certainly
should spend 10 cents an issue to
keep his parents and others informed
on the school.

The attached form may be filled
out and mailed to Box 899, Lexing-
ton, Va., or it may be given to either
Huntley Biggs—SAE or Pete Age-
lasto—Phi Kappa Psi. The payment
of $2.50 may be made now or a
bill could be sent to your parents.

mended that Brown’s fraternity sys-
tem be abandoned.

They accuse fraternities of harbor-
ing an atmosphere inimical to the
true purpose of a university. They
condemn fraternities for fostering
conformity, and call for a removal
of “artificial restrictions” between
individuals.

Their recommendations, although
perhaps a little extreme, are indica-
tive of a widespread trend. The W&L
administration is surely not unaware
of this trend.

“What about the lapel pin you
wear, sir?” I asked. Mr. Wise arose
and walked to the wall. There from
among the assortment of paintings
and prints he took down two frames
and handed them to me. “That’s my
war record,” he said.

I looked at them. In one frame was
a large assortment of medals and rib-
bons. In the other was the Presiden-
tial citation for “extraordinary hero-
ism in battle, retaining command
though wounded.” Col. Wise had
served in France during The First
World War. When I asked him to tell
me how he won the medals which
included the Purple Heart two Dis-
tinguished Services Crosses, and the
French Legion of Honor, he refused
saying, “Any man who holds these
things as personal awards, who
doesn’t give credit to his men and
his subordinates, is just a damn fool.”

But I renewed my request to hear
the stories behind the medals and
he eventually relented. At my insist-

Colonel Wise Expresses Views

That Show Individual Thinking

; ence he went further and told other

adventures which he had experienced
during his long and adventuresome
career. It was fascinating. I was no
longer the cynical student but now
the enthralled youth being told
wonderful adventures by a man who
had lived an amazing life.

One leaves a meeting with Col.
Wise with mixed feelings of anger,
humility, and wonder. Anger because
he adheres to ideas with which one
may disagree. Humility because the
Colonel has led an amazing life and
continues to do so. Wonder, because
in an age when there is such great
pressure to conform to the accepted
ideas of society Col. Wise is an in-
dividual with a singularly indepen-
dent mind.

Wrestling

(Continued from page 3)

In preparing for the match with
UVa., the Generals are counting on
the weakness of the Cavaliers in most
of the weight classes. The Wahoos
lost three of their best men last year,
and probably will be without the
services of Landon Hilliard, ACC
heavyweight champion, who has been
out with a knee injury. The match
starts at 7:30.

A J-V match with the Cavalier
frosh will precede the varsity clash.

 

SIPA Convention in April

The Southern Interscholastic Press
Association’s 32nd annual convention
will be held here on April 28 and
29, according to Prof. O. W. Riegel,
SIPA director and head of the uni-
versity’s department of journalism
and communications.

Brochures announcing the 1961
convention have been mailed to some
1,500 preparatory and high schools
in 13 Southern states and the Dis-
trict of Columbia.

Last year, more than 1,000 student
editors and faculty advisers attend-
ed the weekend event. They took
part in criticism clinics, lectures and
workshop courses aimed at raising
the standards of scholastic journalism
in student newspapers, magazines
and yearbooks.

SIPA trophies are awarded in 17
categories of student publications,
and professional press associations
and newspapers from Virginia ,West
Virginia, North Carolina and South
Carolina make special awards.

The annual convention is spon-
sored by the Lee Memorial Journal-
ism Foundation at Washington and
Lee. Student president for 1961 is
John Anfin of Radford.

Gentlemen preferred by blondes, brunettes, and redheads
prefer ‘Vaseline’ Hair Tonic. That’s because most men use
water with their hair tonic — and ‘Vaseline’ Hair Tonic is
specially made to use with water! The 100% pure grooming
oil in ‘Vaseline’ Hair Tonic replaces the oil that water removes
from your hair. In the bottle and on your hair, the difference
is clearly there! Just a little ‘Vaseline’ Hair Tonic does a lot!
