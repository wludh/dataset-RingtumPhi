Kidnappers Are
Cleared; No

Motive Proven

By HAL McCLANAHAN

James Buchanan and Warren Welsh,
members of the Law School, were ac-
quitted of a kidnapping charge fol-
low the three hour and twenty minute
Mock Trial held last Friday in the
Moot Court of the Law School. A 12-
man jury, composed of undergraduates,
deliberated for ten minutes before
reaching the verdict of “not guilty.”

Buchanan and Welsh had been in-
dicted on a charge of kidnapping Joe
Hess, a law student, after he had been
thrown out of the Paramount Inn on
the night of Oct. 12, 1960. They had
allegedly attempted to force Hess to
drive them to West Virginia, but Hess
had crashed his car into another car
driven by John Petzold in front of
the freshman dormitory in an attempt
to escape.

The attorney for the defense, Bob
McGuire, and his assistants, John Paul
and Dick Barbour, sought to establish
their clients’ innocence by showing
that neither of the defendants had in-
tent to kipnap Hess and that neither
of them had a motive for the crime.

Hugo Hoogenboom, the prosecut-
ing lawyer, and his aides, Tom Feazell
and Leigh Ansell, attempted to prove
that the victim, Hess, did have money
and, produced a ransom note as evi-
dence of the defendants’ motive. They
also attempted to prove that Hess was
forced to drive at gun point before he
intentionally wrecked his car.

During the trial ten witnesses took
the stand, seven for the prosecution
and three for the defense. Three of
the prosecution’s seven witnesses, how-
ever, were impeached by the defense,
thus raising the question as to the
credibility of their testimony.

The Student Bar Association spon-
sors the Mock Trial as a semi-annual
event to give the law students simu-
lated courtroom experience. The law
students, aided by the law faculty in
an advisory capacity, arrange and
present the trial.

Some member of the law faculty, or
some local judge or practitioner acts
as judge. The crime, the circumstances,
the evidence—all phases of the Mock
Trial are coordinated by the Mock
Trial Chairman; this semester’s chair-
man is Richard Parsons.

No admission is charged and any-
one who wishes to see a Mock Trial
may do so. The date for the second
semester’s Mock Trial has not yet been
set.

FD To Regain “Old Spirit”

 

Bond Johnson Appointed Editor

Of Winter Issue

At a recent meeting of the Board
of Publishers of Shenandoah, The
Washington and Lee University Re-
view, Bond Johnson was appointed
editor of the Winter, 1961 issue of
the magazine. Dr. Keith Shillington,
who has previously been published
in Shenandoah, will serve as director
for the issue.

Bond Johnson is a junior at W&L,
having graduated from Ramsay High
School in Birmingham, Ala.

Currently Johnson is a member
of the English Seminar Committee
and the Concert Guild. He took part
in Troubadour productions during
his freshman year. Academically, the
student from Alabama has consist-
ently been listed on the Honor Roll
and the Dean’s List.

When told of his appointment,
Johnson said, “I feel this to be the
greatest honor that has ever befallen
me. Shenandoah should be more of
a student activity; and whatever little
I do for the magazine, I hope, will be
a further step in that direction.”

During the course of the same meet-
ing two new members were appointed

 

NOTICE

There will be a meeting of the
Commerce Fraternity Thursday eve-
ning at 7 o'clock, in Newcomb 36.
All students from the University at
large who are interested in obtain-
ing summer jobs abroad are urgent-
ly requested to attend.

 

Faculty representatives have an-
nounced that 21 Washington and Lee
seniors have filed applications for post-
graduate study abroad through the
Rhodes and Fulbright scholarship pro-
grams. These two plans for student
aid provide over 1,000 scholarships
which will be awarded to outstand-
ing graduates in colleges and univer-
sities throughout the nation.

Dr. Charles Turner, W&L represent-
ative for the Fulbright Scholarships,
has filed a record fifteen applications
by the Oct. 1 deadline. Those apply-
ing for one of the 900 Fulbright grants
for a year of study abroad are: Mal-
colm Brownlee, from Rockbridge
Baths, Va., who plans to study philos-
ophy in England; David Haslett, Lamb-
da Chi from Hickory, N. C., who ap-
plied for a grant to study Philosophy in
Germany; Ed Webster, Lambda Chi
from Norfolk, Va., who lists his course
of study as international relations and
his preferred country as Great Britain.

Victor Lasseter, a Pi Phi from Kis-
simmee, Fla., has applied for a course
of study in European history in Ger-
many. Huntley Biggs, an SAE from
Huntington, W. Va., plans to study
commerce in Columbia. Roy Carpenter,
from Bryan, Texas, has applied to
Germany for a course of study in

 

 

chemistry. Don Partington, a Phi Gam
from Culpeper, Va., has applied for a
grant to study Church history in
France. Jim Vann, a Phi Psi from
Birmingham, Ala., plans to study his-
tory in Austria. Kent Frazier, KA from
Tampa, Florida, has applied to France
as a history student.

Walt Maupin hopes to study Ger-
man literature in Germany. John Paul,
a Pi Phi from New York, has applied to
England for a program of study in
law. Henry Harrell, a Sigma Chi from
Sabot, Va., plans to study English lit-
erature in England.

Drew Danko, a Phi Psi from Bound-
Brook, New Jersey, has applied to
Norway as a student of industrial
psychology. Al Broaddus, a Sigma Nu
from Richmond, Va., hopes to obtain
a scholarship in European economics
in France. Don Rhinesmith, Phi Gam
from Williamsburg, Va., has aplied to
England as a student of English Co-
lonial History.

Dr. Turner mentioned that this
was the largest group of W&L sen-
iors ever to apply for Fulbright
Scholarships. He said, “These stu-
dents have shown a wide variety of
interest in both subject matter and
location of study. The three major

countries offering Fulbright grants
are well represented, with England
having five applicants, France three,
and Germany four. I feel that this
outstanding group of seniors should
present some eligible candidates for
Fulbright Scholarships.”

The Rhodes Scholarships are offered
annually to American college gradu-
ates who wish to study in one of the
26 colleges of Oxford University in
England. Six of this year’s W&L grad-
uates have applied for these coveted
scholarships. The regional applicants
include two from Virginia, two from
Florida, one from Louisiana, and one
from Alabama.

Henry Harrell, Sigma Chi from Sa-
bot, Va., hopes to read law at Oxford
after completing his English major at
W&L. Roy Carpenter, also registered
in Virginia has applied to Oxford as a
student of chemistry with the ultimate
goal of teaching science in prep school.

Kent Frazier, a KA from Tampa,
Fla., hopes to read history at Ox-
ford with a career as history profes-
sor in mind. Nathan Simpson, also a
KA from Tampa, Fla., has applied to
Oxford as a student of either theology
or English. George Pardington, a SPE

W&L Debaters
Cop State Title

An inexperienced Washington and
Lee debate team defeated the top
debating powers in the state last
weekend to capture the Tau Kappa
Alpha State Debating Championship.

Debate team coach William Chaffin
sent three freshmen and a sophomore
to Roanoke to compete in the state-

 

wide debating tournament. None of |

the four had ever competed in a
collegiate debate before.

Representing Washington and Lee
for the affirmative were two Lambda
Chi pledges, Richard McEnally and
Al Eckes. These two freshmen com-
piled a 3-1 record in competition
against 12 teams representing eight
Virginia colleges and universities.

Handling the negative for W&L
were Bill Boardman, a Beta sophomore,
and Jay Clark. In posting a 4-0 rec-
ord, this two-man team defeated both
William and Mary and the University
of Richmond, two schools which have
monopolized the debating scene in
Virginia for years.

This year, William and Mary came
in second, and Richmond finished third.

Mr. Chaffin praised his team’s
showing against their more exper-
ienced opposition, saying that “our
boys did a remarkable job in bring-
ing the state championship to Wash-
ton and Lee.”

He especially cited Jay Clark for
his showing in the meet. Clark, who
has only a few months of debating ex-
perience, pulled down third place in
the entire championship, negative di-
vision.

Mr. Chaffin expressed the hope
that his team would also be entered
in other major debating tournaments
this winter, including the Johns
Hopkins tournament to be held in
Baltimore in late January, and the
Marshall-Wythe tournament, sche-
duled for February in Williamsburg.

“Both Richmond and William and
Mary have been perennial favorites
in Southeastern debates,” he said, “but
our victory in Roanoke has established
W&L as a school to watch this year.”

‘As You Like It’? Theme

Offers Innovations

By STEVEN HENRY

Washington and Lee’s Fancy Dress
Ball will get a needed face-lift this
year, designed to restore to the event
the social prominence it once enjoyed,
Fancy Dress President Don Partington
announced last night.

Fancy Dress—1961—will have as its
theme “As You Like It” or “William
Shakespeare in the Time of James I.”

In 1952, when the same theme was
used Life Magazine thought enough
of the idea to give the dance full
coverage in one issue.

This, however, was in the days when
Fancy Dress was more than “just an-
other weekend.”

But Fancy Dress officials this year
are ready to bring back the event’s
old-time color and pageantry.

They’re starting with the decora-
tions,

There will be more than murals
around the gym this time.

The entire gym will be completely
enclosed, designed after the super-
structure of the famed Globe
Theatre, Shakespeare’s home base in
England.

Featured will be balconies, columns,
a raised stage, and a workable curtain.

There won’t be any false ceiling,
either.

Instead, the flags from various houses
of English nobility will be draped
across the ceiling adding even more
color and realism to the setting.

Added to this, Professor Fitzgerald
Flournoy, quite an authority on
Shakespeare himself, will announce
the Fancy Dress figure.

And the John Graham Brass Choir
will play during the procession.

In a prepared statement for the
Ring-tum Phi, Partington summed it
all up like this:

“In picking this theme, we are
trying to return to the old regality
of Fancy Dress.

“We are trying to get away from
the hodge-podge of costumes which
in the past few years have run the
gamut in time from Knights in
armor to confederate generals.

“We are trying to restore Fancy
Dress to its old splendor by having a
single theme which will lend unity to
the entire dance set.”

 

Professors Attend Meeting

Three members of the faculty of
the School of Commerce and Business
Administration at Washington and Lee
University will attend the annual meet-
ing of the Southern Economics Asso-
ciation this weekend in Atlanta, Ga.

Dr. L. W. Adams, Dean of the
school, Dr. Charles F. Phillips, Jr., and
Dr. Stanley T. Lowry, both assistant
professors of economics, will attend
the sessions which begins Friday.

Dean Adams will attend a deans’
conference of the association Thurs-
\day in Atlanta.

IFC Proposal

The “Help Week” proposals adopted recently by the IFC
are basically sound and certainly deserve student support. The
very fact that the proposal was passed by a vote of fifteen to
one would indicate that at least the fraternity leaders approve of

the plan.

The effectiveness of this proposal depends not only upon

these leaders, but also upon

the whole student body and

more especially upon the work of the ‘‘Positive’’ committee
within the IFC, whose duty it will be to draw up a list of activities
which will be permitted during this “Help Week.”

It is significant to note that this is a “‘positive’’ committee,
and that it will take a positive approach by giving a list of ac-
tivities that will be permitted rather than vaguely prohibiting
the violation “of the principles of good taste” and all activities
that “constitute any physical or emotional hazard to the indi-

vidual.”

To avoid friction and misunderstanding in the enforcement
of the new proposal, the “positive” committee must be specific.
Every precaution must be taken to avoid ambiguity. The list
must be drawn up in such a manner that it would be virtually
impossible for the fraternity authorities to infer from its listed
activities more than was intended either by the “‘positive’”’ com-

mittee or by the IFC as a whole.

The list which is to be drawn up should not be too narrow or
restrictive and should omit only those activities which the com-
mittee believes to be imminently dangerous to the physical or
emotional well-being of the fraternity initiates.

“Help Week” definitely has its place on the Washington
and Lee campus. Since the advent of the Commons, it has be-

come even more important. It

is the only period during the

freshman year that the freshmen spend any appreciable length
of time at their respective fraternity houses. It is usually the
only period other than rush week that all of the active members
of a fraternity come in contact with their freshman class as

a class.

It is one of the few periods during the year that the pledges
have to act together as a class. They develop a sense of unity
among themselves. Strangely enough, they become more at-
tached to the fraternity. In addition, they are drawn closer to
the body of active members through their participation in a

common system of initiation.

The plan which has been passed by the IFC will serve to
protect this necessary institution from abuse from without
by restricting the abuse which has, in the past, been inherent
from within the institution itself.

Ferre Praised; Academic Flops

Solaced; Announcer Scolded

By ED WEBSTER

To many students, the University
Religious Conference is about as wel-
come, and about as necessary, as
light is to a pair of lovers. Tradition-
ally, classes are shortened, assemblies
are held every other hour, and speak-
ers earnestly tell the students, (a)
what we already know, or (b) what
we don’t want to know.

This year’s conference was a notable
improvement over some held in pre-
vios years. For one thing, each of the
speakers held a different point of
view, for one was a rabbi, another
was a priest, and the third was a lib-
eral Protestant theologian.

Dr. Ferre, the theologian, was
warmly personable, and at the same
time outspokenly critical of the er-
rors of modern religion. Out of the
wreckage of the traditional schools
of Christianity, he built a religious
framework that was new, and yet not
really new at all. If we don’t get
busy and formulate a dynamic re-
ligion, he warned, we may be invit-
ing destruction.

Even people who dislike religious

conferences will have to admit that Dr.
Ferre may be right.

which watched the election returns
much as a spectator watches a tennis
match, will be growing up under a
new era. Kennedy, from all appear-
ances, is about the most dynamic and
effective leader in the United States
today.

If it’s any consolation to you,
Kennedy was a flop in college. He
was undoubtedly bright, but his pro-
fessors accused him of lacking pur-
pose. (Probably Harvard didn’t of-
him any New Frontiers.) What's
more, he was a poor speller.

I seem to recall that a lad named
Churchill made a notoriously poor
record in his British prep school. In
fact, many of the great artists, scientists,
and statesmen of Western civilization
have been academic misfits.

I wonder how many future geniuses |

flunk out of W&L each year. Of course,
W&L prides itself on producing gentle-
men, not geniuses.

“Jazz on a Summer’s Day” Rated Excellent

By BILL ROBERTS

“Jazz on a Summer’s Day,” which
has just finished playing at the Lyric,
is one of the best flicks we’ve ever
seen. It certainly does credit to Mr.
Ed Side’s continuing effort to bring
the best motion pictures to Lexington.

It stands to Washington and Lee’s
credit that the local cinemas have
been feeling lately the effects of a
more critical attitude toward movie-
going. There are few courses on the
hill which fail to outdraw, say, “They
Came to Cordura.”

The film is made up of color foot-
age shot at the 1958 Newport Jazz
Festival and the America’s Cup races
late that summer. All these miscel-
laneous scenes have been woven into
a selection of music from the Festival
to form an absorbing and coherent
whole. The finished product once
again shows film-editing can rank
alongside directing, photography, and
acting as an art. Or, in broader
terms, that technology and art are

not incompatible.

The men who produced this motion
picture were faced with a tremen-
dous temptation to lapse into that
cynical depiction of normal human
gracelessness we are so used to.

The merciless photographs of audi-
ence and performer and party-er at
the Festival show a great many people
in less than advantageous poses. The
movie judiciously reveals what people
look like when they don’t know they’re
being watched and affirms that this is
as much us as the public pose.

This type of movie, one with no
narartive and no predetermined se-
quence depends, of course, very much
on the event which it considers. The
Newport Jazz festival is the biggest
and best-known of the growing num-
ber of summer jazz festivals in the
United States. It and the other similar
festivals provide a place for jazz de-
votees to get together and sample
in a few days the varying musical
fare presented them under the gener-

 

ic heading, “jazz.”

Jazz music as represented at the
Festival is a uniquely American art.
Serious jazz musicians and their listen-
ers participate in the semi-spontaneous
experience which typifies the concept
of “empathy” so often discussed in
introductory art classes. The motion
picture makes this point beautifully
and reiterates the classlessness of jazz.

“Jazz on a Summer’s Day” is one

of those few motion pictures which
set one to ruminating on abstract
and supposedly higher themes:
America, art vs. life, the direction
of modern society, etc. And one
leaves with the satisfaction that
something has been said; an attempt
to answer questions about our life
and society.

The most striking note in the pic-
ture is the diversity of music pre-
sented. It is impossible to compare
Chuck Berry and Mahalia Jackson,
and hard to conceive of a program

 

that can include them both, But that
very program presented them, and
Louis Armstrong, and Gerry Mulligan,
and many others. The festival pre-
sented them without comment. It
simply erected a bandstand and pro-
vided for an audience.

The movie does comment. Its
razor-sharp camera work probes the
physiognomy of Thelonious Monk
and juxtapositions those shots with
the announcer’s introduction of the
pianist at the festival, The ever-
grinding cameras record the wide
variety of reactions to each artist.
One comes to know certain individ-
uals in the audience.

All in all, “Jazz on a Summer’s
Day” is a wonderful motion picture,
one worth seeing again and again. The
Lyric had a good print of it this week.
We only wish the sound system were
better there. The music selected for
the film deserves the best reproduc-
tion possible.

 

LETTERS

TO THE

pitok

\3

Gentlemen:
Steps must be taken to correct the

 

unfortunate and shameful situation
now existing in Lee Chapel—not only
in the chapel itself, but more specifi-
cally in the basement museum.

One of the first horrors to greet!

the students, parents, alumni, and tour-
ists is the dreary brown linoleum run-
ner slithering down the aisles of the
chapel. Yet, this is elegent when com-
pared with the deteriorating, tasteless,
orange linoleum which covers the plat-
form. This ugly picture might be
likened to the floor of a bar and grill
rather than to that of a chapel hous-
ing the remains of General Lee and
his family.

The lighting system is also an eye-
sore. At night, those countless rows of
naked, glaring, and offensive light-
bulbs which stretch across the ceiling
presents a bizarre sight indeed.

The greatest disgrace, however,
awaits the visitor in the museum on
the basement floor. The most basic
precautions usually taken to pre-
serve valuable documents, memen-
toes, and other items of historical
interest are either unknown or vir-
tually ignored by those responsible
for their preservation. Rare original
documents, including letters and
diplomas signed by Lee, the map he
used during the war, and other items
too large in number to mention, are
suspended inside their clumsily de-
signed glass cases by thumbtacks and
scotch taps, like so many Playmate
pinups or announcements on the
ODK board.

Flags, clothing, and uniforms per-
taining to Lee and the Confederacy
are fair game to moths and other in-
sects. At least it must be assumed, for
as late as last spring one or two of
the information cards in the cases
(they have since been removed or
replaced) were partially consumed by
destructive insects.

It also appears that the same mind
that would drive a thumbtack through
the Declaration of Independence, if it
had the chance, also conceived (or is
happy to ignore) the chaotic fashion in
which the objects are displayed in the
cases. Documents are piled on docu-
ments, flags on flags, etc. The most im-
portant items seem to be on the bottom
but this is merely speculatory because
a close examination is impossible. Of-
ten the object covers up the sign de-
scribing it, or vica versa! Many signs
are upside down.

It might be argued that the mu-
seum is cramped for space, but
much of the material on display is
not worthy of being in any muesum.
Some of the items are irrelevant,
having no significent bearing on the
University, the Lee family, or the
war.

I strongly urge that action be taken
to correct the situation. Our museum,
at present, is as attractive, coherent,
and meaningful as the back end of a
loaded Salvation Army truck.

Sincerely,
RICHARD W. HOOVER

Saturday’s Game Elating Experience

By GERRY OUELLETTE

Last Saturday’s game elated us as
nothing has so done for quite some
time. From the initial kick-off our
pride increased progressively with
each new quarter. We walked the
footbridge, at the close of the game,
very tall for our size. We can only
pity those who had the occasion to
witness the game and did not do so.

In all honesty, however, we must
admit that our original plan called

 

for a Saturday afternoon spent in the
library; but fate had decided other-
wise. We discovered after trying to
force the front door several times that
our attempts were in vain. After temp-
ering our first reaction with a “Oh,
well, you can’t work all the time,”
we headed for Wilson Field. Needless
to say, research or no research, we
felt after the game that our involun-
tary choice had been worthwhile. We
can assert that having such a thing

 

Dance Board Should Not Stretch
W&L Honor System Too Far
Columnist Hoogenboom Cautions

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

One of the strengths of the honor
system at Washington and Lee is that
it concerns itself only with those mat-
ters which are properly questions of
honor. In the main, efforts to incorpor-
ate petty little rules into the honor
system have failed, because it was
realized that an honor system can, un-
der certain conditions, degenerate in-
to an informer’s system.

For a long while the fantastic of-
fence of hiding library books was put
under the honor system, as neatly
printed cards announced. This was
done away with, to the good of the
system, for nothing creates contempt
and scorn for an honor system more
quickly than efforts to employ it to
enforce basically un-enforceable rules.

In my opinion, we are once again
attempting to enforce a rule which
does not properly come under the
honor system. This is in the matter
of non-transferability of dance plans.
The dance board decided, for per-
fectly valid reasons of their own, to
make dance plans non-transferable.
Then, faced with the extremely dif-
ficult job of enforcing this rules,
presumably asked the executive
committee to make it an honor vio-
lation (this is in no way intended
to reflect on the present dance board,
for this regulation has been in effect
for several years).

Now, borrowing a dance plan is not
inherently dishonorable, or doesn’t
seem so to many people. There is, con-
sequently, a great temptation to use
another’s plan, and the user doesn’t
feel that he’s doing anything which
can be equated to lying, cheating, or
stealing. The psychological effect of a

 

 

successful violation is great: It makes
a subsequent violation, a more serious
one, easier to commit. It breeds con-
tempt for the system as a set of petty
rules. This obviously weakens the
system.

Analogous to the present mis-use
would be a sudden declaration that
drinking in the dormitory was a vio-
lation. No transfer is equally absurd.

It is the perogative of the dance
board to decide that for financial rea-
sons they don’t want dance plans go-
ing from hand to hand. But it is, in
that case, the responsibility of the
board to enforce its own rules. A
simple system would be to announce
that any dance plan transferred to and
used by a non-owner is voided.

If something of this sort were
done, the honor system could be kept
out of the peripheral areas, where
it doesn’t belong, and returned to the
plain areas, where it does. Continued
abuse of the system will cause it to
degenerate to a condition similar to
that in many girls schools, where
even smoking is under the honor

system.
+ * *

Another of our cherished traditions
is also verging on the ridiculous, and
is being weakened by overly rigid ap-
plication. That is, of course, conven-
tional dress. It should be enforced
only within the confines of the campus.
If people won't dress decently because
of social pressure, then the appearance
our student body presents is a sham,
and doesn’t matter anyway. And per-
haps we could be spared this year
the dictates of the arbiter elegantiarum
as to whether bermuda shorts are ac-
ceptable for the concert or not.

 

as a “Football Weekend Schedule” at
the library is justified, as indeed our
experience revealed.

May we suggest that the spirit ex-
hibited by the library be spilled over
into another great source of school
spirit: the sports page of the Ring-
tum Phi. What is by name “the
sports page” often strikes the eye
as more of an advertisement page;
and this is true for both editions.

We don’t claim to be adept in the
business facet of our newspaper, but
we feel that more sports and fewer
ads on page three are in order. What’s
the use of everyone talking about
school spirit, if the school’s newspaper
displays an incapability of promoting
this very thing.

If the problem lies in the lack of
copy, may we suggest that sports
editorials and sports feature stories
are not unborn creations of the jour-
nalistic world.

We went to the flick one evening
last week, and we were rather sur-
prised at the small student attend-
ance. We wonder what new trend
has suddenly overtaken the students
of this University. We don’t see the
students in familiar town places of
entertainment; and others remark that
University sponsored activities attend-
ances are not as they should indeed
be. What has caused this? Where are
the students? Has the early cold snap
in the weather moderated the stu-
dents’ usually energetic urges; or have

| the students suddenly become addict-

ed to a new disease, which for like of
a better word, we could name study-
itis?

Rumor has it that the First Lady-
elect, Jackie Bovier Kennedy, pro-
nounced herself on the question of
American education one day last
week. When asked for her views,
she replied that she thought all
Americans should attend the Sor-
bonne. We cannot help but link this
remark with that of another First
Lady who nonchalantly murmured,
“Let them eat cake!”

Anecdote of the week heard on

— Generals Win Again; This Time It’s Sewanee, 32-8

W&L Nears Undefeated Season
As The Five-Stars Smash Tigers

By BEN CHAPMAN

With their offense and defense tak-
ing equal bows, the undefeated and
once-tied Five-Star Generals took
complete command of Sewanee on
Wilson Field last Saturday and scored
a surprisingly easy 32-8 decision.

W&L piled up 439 yards on the
ground and scored in every quarter in
the almost one-sided contest. Full-
back Doug Martin and _ halfback
Charley Gummey picked up most of
the yardage for the Generals.

W&L took the opening kick-off
and drove to the Sewanee 20 yard
line where a clipping penalty halted
the march. The Sewanee single
wing attack was unable to move and
the Generals took over on the Purple
Tiger 37. This time the Generals
were not to be denied and Jim
Hickey skirted his own right end for
4 yards and the touchdown. Hickey
also added the two extra points and
W&L led 8-0.

M'nutes later Doug Martin set up
the second General score with a 43
yard dash to the Tiger 17. Charley
Gummey drove over from 4 yards out
for the score.

Leading 14-0 with several minutes
left in the half, the Generals had
another opportunity to score when
Dan Blain’s punt rolled dead on
the Sewanee 1. The Tigers punted
on their third down, but W&L’s
third unit took over on the 29. With
10 seconds remaining in the half, |
Joe Hess drove from the 2 to end |
the half, 20-0.

In the third quarter Steve Suttle
returned a Sewanee punt to the Tiger,
19 to set up W&L’s fourth score. Jim |
Russ went around end for the last |
few yards and the touch down. The try
for two points failed and the Generals
led 26-0.

In the fourth quarter Sewance |
turned to the air. Tailback Wallace
Pinkley hit wingback Agnew on the
sidelines for a 45 yard pass and
touchdown. The visitors passed for

 

 

the two extra points after faking
a kick. With five minutes remaining
in the game, the Generals scored
the final touchdown of the day. Doug
Martin scored this one from 18 yards
out to cap a 70 yard drive.

Appearing on Wilson Field for the
last time were Courtney Mauzy, Ter-
ry Fohs, Bill Willes, Mal Brownlee,
Graham Fulton, Tom Budd, Windy
Weed, Joe Hess, Jim Russ, Tiff Tiffany,
and Bob Funkhouser. Russ and Fohs,
while not seniors, are on the 3-2
plan and will move on to Carnegie
Tech next year.

The Generals will close out the
season next week against Washington
University in St. Louis on the 19th.

Coaches Corner

Sewanee G WU

The white jerseys didn’t seem to
hurt us and neither did the purple
ones of the Sewanee Tigers.

It was as much a defensive victory
as it was an offensive one. The de-
fensive play of Tommy Goodwin, Doug
Martin, Bill Willes, Tommy Keesee,
Mickey Walker, and Joe Hess took
away from Sewanee the favorite play
of the single-wing attack, the off-
tackle power play. While the three
unit combination was accomplishing
this feat the rest of the squad managed
to hold the Sewanee ground attack to
a mere 76 yards.

For the first time this season we
failed to intercept an enemy pass.
This is a credit to the fire-bullet
passing of the Tigers.

For an unsung hero I pick Phil
McCaleb who switched from tackle
to end this week to fill a vacancy
created when Ned Hobbs was side-
lined. Phil did yeoman service on
the Gold unit.

HOW TO BEAT THE BEAT GENERATION

My cousin Herkie Nylet is a sturdy lad of nineteen summers
who has, we all believed until recently, a lively intelligence and
an assured future. Herkie’s father, Walter O. Nylet, is as every-
one knows, president of the First National Artificial Cherry
Company, world’s largest maker of artificial cherries for ladies’
hats. Uncle Walter had great plans for Herkie. Last year he
sent Herkie to the Maryland College of Humanities, Sciences,
and Artificial Cherries, and he intended, upon Herkie’s gradu-
ation, to find him a nice fat wife and take him into the firm as
a full partner.

Could a young man have more pleasing prospects? Of course
not. But a couple of months ago, to everyone’s consternation,
Herkie announced that he was not going into the artificial cherry
business. Nor was he going to stay in college. “I am,” said
Herkie, ‘‘a member of the Beat Generation. I am going to San
Francisco and grow a beard.”

Well sir, you can imagine the commotion in the family when
Herkie went traipsing off to San Francisco! Uncle Walter would
have gone after him and dragged him home, but unfortunately
he was right in the middle of the artificial cherry season. Aunt
Thelma couldn’t go either because of her old leg trouble. (One
of her legs is older than the other.)

            

“une Wo aesou P

So I went. I searched San Francisco for weeks before I found
Herkie living under the counter of a Pronto Pup stand. “Herkie,
how are you?” I cried, looking distraughtly upon his tangled
beard, his corduroy jacket, his stricken eyes.

“Beat,” said Herkie.

I offered him a Marlboro and felt instantly better when he
took it because when one smokes Marlboros, one cannot be too
far removed from the world. One still has, so to speak, a hold
on the finer things of life—like good tobacco, like easy-drawing
filtration, like settling back and getting comfortable and enjoy-
ing a full-flavored smoke. One is, despite all appearances, basi-

cally happiness-oriented, fulfillment-directed, pleasure-prone.

“Herkie, what are you doing with yourself?” I asked.

“T am finding myself,” he replied. “I am writing a novel in
the sand with a pointed stick. I am composing a fugue for
clavier and police whistle. I am sculpting in experimental ma-
terials—like English muffins.”

“And what do you do for fun?” I asked.

“Come,” he said and took me to a dank little night club
where men in beards and women in basic burlap sat on orange
crates and drank espresso. On a tiny stage stood a poet reciting
a free-form work of his own composition entitled Excema: The

Story of a Boy while behind him a jazz trio played 200 choruses
of T'in Roof Blues.

‘“Herkie,” said I, “come home with me to the artificial cherries.”
“No,” said Herkie, so sadly I went home to tell Uncle Walter
the bad news. He was less distressed than I had feared. It seems
Uncle Walter has another son, a quiet boy named Edvorts, about
whom he had completely forgotten, and today Edvorts is in

business with Uncle Walter and Herkie is beat in San Francisco,
and everyone is happy.

an unfiltered smoke, with Philip Morris. Try the brand-new

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

A ski and skate show will be held |
in the mezzanine of the Robert E. Lee
Hotel this Saturday from 10 a.m. until
5 p.m., it was announced today by |
Pres Brown, sponsor of the program. |

On hand will be Sepp Kober, well-|
known ski instructor at the Home-
stead, and Betty Shurbin, skating in- |
structor at the same resort.

Seven door prizes, including a trans- |
istor radio, ice skates, a wool ski shirt, |
an imported pullover ski shirt, alum- |
inum ski poles, and a how to ski}
record, will be given away, according |

to Brown.

The senior class placed the largest
number of students on the mid-se-
mester honor roll. Eighteen of the 38
honor roll students were seniors.

In the junior class, nine students
achieved honor roll standing. The
sophomore and freshman classes each
placed three students.

Dean Frank J. Gilliam explained that
seniors earned the higher grades be-
cause they had become adjusted to
feeling their potential. In comment-
ing on the number of freshmen on
the honor roll, he stated, “By past
experience, the number of freshmen
on the honor roll will increase at
the end of the semester.”

Last year only twenty-six students
were on the first mid-semester hon-
or roll. Of that number, only two
were freshmen.

To qualify for honor roll standing,
sudents must earn a 2.5 average, re-
ceive no grade below a “C” and suc-
cessfully meet the requirements of
the Physical Education Department.
This year four students were denied
placement on the honor roll because
of the provision concerning physical
education.

Jerry Dattel, Chairman of the Sen-
ior Ring Committee, announced that
senior rings will go on sale Wednes-
day in the fraternity houses. The rings
will vary in price from $30.50 to $36.95.
The schedule for the ring sales is as
