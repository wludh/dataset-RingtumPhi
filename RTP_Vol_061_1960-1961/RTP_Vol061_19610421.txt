Robrecht, Suttle Tapped By Independents

Questions Fly, Answers Don’t
As Forum Challenges Candidates

Around 30 interested students
heard the five candidates for the
student body offices exchange views
Wednesday evening in the first
forum held to bring issues to light.

The forum was sponsored by the
Friday Ring-tum Phi and was gen-
erally hailed as a move in the right
direction even though many stu-
dents came away from the session
disappointed in the results.

The five candidates, Rosewell Page,
Ray Robrecht and Charles Com-
mander, Steve Suttle and Bill Out-
man, faced a panel composed of
Nathan Simpson, Ed Webster, Grey-
ford Gray, Robert Ketcham, Mal-
colm Brownlee, Bill Roberts and
George Honts. Student Body presi-
dent Kent Frazier acted as modera-
tor. Questions were also entertained
from the floor.

Opening Remarks

In their opening remarks each of
the candidates stated their position.
(Ed. note: the statements of each
candidate is given in the closest
possible words that he used. It was,
however, impossible to obtain exact
quotations).

Page, the sole candidate for presi-
dent, said he felt the situation is
basically good, but that some revi-
sion is needed. The Honor System, to
him, is the main issue at the pres-
ent, and he defended it by saying
it is the best to be obtained. He
expressed the feeling that the gen-
eral EC meetings should be covered
by the paper or open to the general
student body.

Charles Commander, candidate for
vice president, said no _ drastic
changes are needed.

Ray Robrecht, candidate for vice-
president, said it was his feeling that
there is a lack of knowledge in
the student body concerning the
Honor System. He said students must
know what the areas of needed re-
vision are before they can be asked
to support any changes in the sys-
tem.

Bill Outman, candidate for secre-
tary, said no area of needed re-
vision exists.

Steve Suttle, candidate for sec-
retary, commented that a more in-
formed student body is the first
need.

Question from Tony Gray: Have
you spent ten hours studying the
constitution? All five said yes.

Grey: Is the government demo-
cratic? Should it be democratic?

Candidate: How do you mean?

Gray: An Athenian democracy.

Robrecht replied he didn’t think
it would work here since there is not
that great an interest in what goes
on. The EC makes decisions, he
said, and it is subject to review.
“Executive” he continued, means
more than representative.

Commander stated he thought such
a system was too perfect for the
student body. He pointed out that
incompetent members of the com-
mittee can be impeached.

Outman said such a system would
be harmful for the university. In
effect he said the EC is not all in-
clusive and it does not enter every
phase of student life.

Page pointed out that many of
the representative IFC’s attempt to
enact changes are taken back to the
fraternities and hooted down by mi-
norities. He wondered how many
students would participate.

Suttle declared the EC does not
have too much power. The inequality
exists in the party system. He said
the composition of the EC leaves
a large part of the student body
unrepresented.

From the floor: Wouldn’t it be a
good idea to give freshmen points
to remember at the beginning of the
year?

Suttle: Yes, if the questions are
brought up from the students invol-
ved.

From floor: Couldn’t some ques-
tions be anticipated?

Page: No, Only if something is
brought up from the student body,
then it should be ruled on.

Outman: No.

Commander: The field is too broad
to cover.

Robrecht: No, but a definite clari-
fication of certain points si possible.

 

 

Panelist Ketcham asked if any of |

the candidates would desire a change
in the Honor System so that the

EC must be unanimous in declaring
guilt. Five no.’s.

Gray: What will you do to fight] {

apathy?

Robrecht: What kind of apathy?

Gray: Just what will any of you
do if elected. Is there any reason
you should be running except for
the title?

Charles Commander: I have no
proposal. Apathy can’t be changed
by policy. It takes time and more
than one program.

Gray: What would you do for a
start then?

Page: I’ve said it once before to-
night, but one thing is to give more
information to the students. Pub-
lish the minutes of the EC, so the

 

students would know what’s going
on. There is no need for a constitu-

tional revision. I feel the constitu-
tion as it stands is best.

Outman said he would second the
idea.

Robrecht commented that there’s
nothing going on in the EC to be
ashamed of. No one has ever asked
to attend a meeting that he knows
of.

Panelist Ketcham: Do you believe
all punishment under the Honor
System should be the same regard-
less of the nature of the violation?

Commander: Where do you draw
the line? Many cases go deeper
than the rumors of the case show.
I have faith in the judgment of the
EC members.

Robrecht: There are degrees of
honor. But different punishments are
not possible under a workable sys-
tem.

Roberts: How do you tell if it is
a violation?

Page: If doubt exists, the student
should check on it. Ignorance of the
law is no excuse.

Gray: You mean you would con-
demn a man for a fringe violation
in the same degree as an open and
flagrant violation?

Page: You cannot codify the sys-
tem or ever get it down pat.

Suttle: If doubt exists in a case,
ask the professor about it. Again
information is needed; students can
ask EC members for interpretations.

Page: The EC members have to
make value judgments, then decide
the guilt or innocence.

Suttle: There is a way out. Sig-
natures of 50 students can force a
call meeting of the Student Body.
Then it can rescind any action of
the EC.

Ketcham: You do find a difference
in a law court and a Honor System
case?

Page: The manner of procedure
followed is different. The EC is not
a law court; there is no prosecution
or defense. No member of the EC
should drive for a verdict of guilty.
And secrecy protects the innocent.
There are no jury proceedings. The
EC as a whole tries the cases. One
man can’t make the decision.

Craven from floor: I want to know
what you are going to do.

Page: I have no platform. (Craven:
I don’t ask for one). The Honor
System and the Constitution stand
for themselves. I don’t know what
can be done to get more student
participation.

 

Robrecht: You're getting down to|

Broaddus Gets
Fulbright Award

John A. Broaddus, Jr., a Sigma Nu
senior from Richmond, has_ been
awarded a Fulbright Scholarship for
study in France next year, Dr. C.
W. Turner announced today.

Dr. Turner, who is chairman of
the Fulbright Scholarships on the
W&L campus, said that Broaddus
will study at the University of Stras-
bourg. He will specialize in political
and and economic studies while in
France, Dr. Turner added.

Approximately nine hundred
grants for graduate study abroad in
the year 1961-62 are being awarded,
the American history professor said.

The international educational ex-
change program is designed to pro-
mote a better understanding of the
United States in other countries,
and to increase mutual understand-
ing between the people of the U.S.
and other countries, he said.

Broaddus is a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, is
president of this year’s Finals Dance
Set. He served as vice-president of
the junior class last year, and was
historian of his sophomore class.

The only other Washington and
Lee student to have received a Ful-
bright Award this year was James
A. Vann.

| Montgomery, Applebaum, Russ
And Frisbie In Dance Set Race

junior from Kew Garden Hills, N. Y.,
will seek the Fancy Dress presiden-
cy. Rick Frisbie, a Kappa Sigma
junior from Arlington, Va., is the
candidate for Springs Dances. And
Jim Russ, a Phi Psi junior from
Holidaysburg, Pa., will vie for the
Finals Dance Set.

Robrecht, an intermediate law stu-
dent from Plainfield, N. J., has been
tapped for ODK and will represent
Alpha Circle at a National meeting
in the near future. He is head dor-
mitory counselor and past president
of Phi Gamma Delta. Robrecht is
now the Executive Committee rep-
resentative from the intermediate
law class. He is a boxer; and he has
contributed to the Law Review.

Suttle, a junior from Uvalde, Tex.,
is past president of Delta Tau Delta
and secretary of the junior class. A
Dean’s List student, he is co-cap-
tain and star quarterback of the un-
beaten Five-Star Generals’ football
team. The Lexington Junior Cham-
ber of Commerce recently chose him
for their outstanding athlete award.
Suttle also plays varsity lacrosse,
and is a member of the Varsity Club.
He has also represented his house
in the IFC and will be Rush Chair-
man next year.

Montgomery is secretary of the
sophomore class and a Robert E.
Lee Scholar. He was the first In-
dependent Party member to be
chosen for membership on the Stu-
dent War Memorial Scholarship
Fund Committee in recent years.
He is secretary-treasurer of the Stu-
dent Service Society and a fraternity
officer. Montgomery is co-captain of
the wrestling team and a member of
the Cotillion Club. A Dean’s List
student he has contributed to the
Ring-tum Phi and the Calyx.

Applebaum is business manager
of Shenandoah and was vice presi-
dent of the 1961 Fancy Dress Ball.
He is a fraternity officer and active
in the Glee Club. While maintaining
Dean’s List grades, Applebaum has
appeared in several Troubadour pro-
ductions. He has been a member of
the soccer team.

Frisbie is vice president of Kappa
Sigma and has represented his house
on the IFC. He is a member of the
Glee Club, Scabbard and Blade, and
the Cotillion Club. His activities also
include the Gaines Guard.

Russ, a Dean’s List student, is a
fraternity officer and a member of
the Student Service Society. He
played freshman basketball and has
been a starting member of the foot-
ball and baseball teams for three
years. He is a member of the Varsity
Club. Russ is also active on the
Southern Collegian,

The Independent Party, which is
on the short side of a 10-8 split in
the fraternities, claims to be down
125 votes before the balloting begins.
But some Independent Party spokes-
men are optimistic.

One of the party leaders said
“The Party has a good chance to
take four of the big seven positions.”
Last year the Independent Party
captured Fancy Dress and came
within 30 votes of winning three
other top offices.

However, the outcome of this
year’s election can not be safely pre-
dicted. Both parties have intensified
their campaigning and _ tightened
their organization. The candidates
have been “hitting the trail” in the
dorm and visiting fraternity houses.
The unprecedented forum sponsored
Wednesday by the Friday edition
of the Ring-tum Phi gave the top
five candidates a chance to state
their views on vital issues and to
give the students a fresh look at
familiar faces. This, too, may influ-
ence the election.

The imbalance in power came in
1958 when the Sigma Chi house led
a splinter of the then-dominant In-
dependent Party in the now-domi-
nant University Party. With a work-
able majority guaranteed the party
in power, whichever it may be, can
control the political situation to a
great degree. There are, however,

| some signs of the rigid lines of party
| voting being broken. The change in

The Washington and Lee Seminars |

Graham-Lee Society, the Washing- |

voting patterns is caused, some ob-
servers feel, by the weakening of
ties between upperclassmen and
their fraternity freshmen. More in-
dependent voting among upperclass-
men is also in evidence.

Vacillating

Candidates

Merit No Endorsement

The Friday Edition of the Ring-tum Phi does not choose to
endorse a slate of candidates in the forthcoming student body
elections. Our Editorial Staff heartily concurs in this decision
to break with a practice historically followed by this newspaper.

Let us make it clear that we are not evading the issue, nor
are we abrogating such a policy because of considerations other
than those of insuring a vital and improved student govern-
ment. We feel that the only purpose served by the selection of
a slate at this time would be the distortion of facts and issues
that demand an accurate and unbiased appraisal.

We could possibly, with negligible reflection, endorse three
of the five announced candidates for president, vice president,
and secretary on the basis of what we consider to be their po-
tential for meeting the demands of the respective offices—in
other words their ability. But this alone, unfortunately, is not
the only prerequisite for Executive Committee service.

Borne out by Wednesday evening’s forum, we feel that
there is a noticeable lack of purpose, avowed or otherwise, in-
forming the motives of some, if not all, of these candidates.
Their stands on certain campus problems reflect definite diagno-
ses of the situation—for example, each agreed and cited apathy
as a deterrant to effective student government, both legislative
and judicial—but there was little or no prognosis offered. In
other words, the candidates understood our problems, but posed
no possible solutions. When challenged with the reality of this
indictment, each responded with stock platitudes, save one,
who suggested that the minutes of the Executive Committee’s
legislative sessions be made public.

The same candidate that offered this positive proposal,
which is to a degree indicative of his purpose for seeking office,
was the only student, in our opinion, that demonstrated a clear
and acceptable position on the nature of honor. We feel that
Representative Page’s understanding of this abstract quality and
its ramifications in our system were noteworthy. For the benefit
of the other candidates, each of whose answers indicated a re-
luctance or failure to grasp this concept, honor is not manifest
in degrees—it is most absolute. There are no shades of honor—
either an act is honorable or it is dishonorable. As far as peri-
pheral areas are concerned, remoteness exists only in the situa-
ation provoking an honorable or dishonorable response, not in
the concept of honor itself. Because of their obvious failure to
ascertain such basic concepts over and above the practical man-
ifestations of the honor system and the constitution, we feel that
each of the candidates, save Page, should effect a stronger grasp
upon the principles, and their techniques should logically fol-

low.

Unless the candidates lucidate their stands and clear up
their obvious inconsistencies of thought, they are not suitable
to serve in the capacity to which they now seek nomination and
election. We would suggest that rather than taking meals at
fraternity houses and sponsoring kegs, each candidate should
crystallize his proposals and seek every possible opportunity
to present them to the student body. If a candidate feels that
the status quo should be maintained, let him give his reasons
why. If he advocates change, let him state what change and
why. If they are to lead, they might as well begin this evening
and convince this student body of their ability and dedication
to cope with the tender situations that now confront Washing-
ton and Lee’s student government.

We suggest that the candidates take advantage of the nomi-
nating convention—now a mere formali¢y—and either offer
their stands or have them cited by the persons placing their
names in nomination. We would also advocate another forum,
and are willing to sponsor it, prior to election day at which time
the candidates can be prepared to defend their proposals.
Unless such a situation can be realized, and unless these can-
didates can take a positive, definite and dynamic stand on cur-
rent issues as well as convince the student body of their inten-
tions and qualifications, we suggest, in the best interest of
Washington and Lee, that the cliques meet again and find some-

body who can and will.

RES IPSA LOQUITUR

 

Executive Committee Hopefuls
Need Clearly Drawn Proposals

By ROBERT C. KETCHAM
Friday Columnist

The five prospective members of
next year’s EC had their first trial
in the Student
Union Wednesday
night. Trial in the
sense that they
were expected to
give their various
views on the hon-

improve the gov-
erning of the stu-
dent body, and
proposals implicit
in their prospec-
tive positions as

   

Ketcham
campus leaders.

This writer was not impressed by
the general overall tone of the an-
swers relating to these issues. Since
it was the first time that candidates
have been expected to state their
views publically, criticism in gross
quantities is probably uncalled for.
However, the men running for these
positions should be able to express
themselves as to basic concepts of
honor and furthermore, each should
have in his own mind reasons for
effecting or not effecting a change.

The only really constructive pro-
posal that I found to come out of
the session was the idea of publish-
ing the minutes of the Monday meet-
ing of the EC. It might also be
stated that in response to a yes-no
vote Steve Suttle was the only one
to respond in the affirmative.

With the current campus discus-
sion and criticism of the present
EC as to the handling of cases, right

 

i:

of defense counsel, charging the
accused with the specific offense
and even the notion of differing de-
grees of punishment, more should
have been said.

That is to say, there was little or
no mention by the candidates as to
the basis of their beliefs. They did
not couch thier answers in the neces-

or system, ways to; sary foundation, or so it seems to

me, that honor is narrowly defined
to include lying, cheating and steal-
ing. That our system should not be
stretched to correspond to the ac-
cusatory system adopted by the
states because of its uniqueness in
relating to the students of this uni-
versity.

The recent EC case over which so
much controversy has raged was
mentioned by implication in more
than one candidate’s answer. The de-
cision was agreed with. That is all
fine and good, but it was stated
why it was agreed with. The candi-
dates stayed on the fringe, they did
not seem ready to come to grips with
the problem.

I would think, after reading the
facts available, that honor did neces-
sitate the decision reached. What
was needed by the candidates in
their explanation was a statement
which recognizes that our system
gives a black-white definition. That
our system cannot recognize degrees
of honor, a matter is either honor-
able or dishonorable.

Another cloud was born when the
question of student apathy was
raised and led into a burden on the

 

Candidates Are Astute Politicians
Student Forum Is Step Forward

By GEORGE HONTS
Managing Editor

All five of the candidates for the
big three offices showed themselves
to be astute politicans at the Wed-
nesday night forum. When caught in
a sharp volley of questions they
all showed the resistence of five
bowls of jelly. Actually, no one there
would have liked to have attempted
an answer to some of the questions
put to the candidates, but their re-
sponse in some instances was want-
ing.

Nevertheless the forum was more
than worthwhile, it was highly en-
lightening. It is especially significant
that this first attempt to get an in-
sight to the views of the candidates
was made at this time—a time when
century-old traditions are being
challenged by a modern and not so
perfect generation. Certainly sev-
eral “myths” both favorable and
unfavorable, were resolved by the
open and frank discussion.

Before discussing the candidates,

let me make it explicit that I am!

writing as an observer and not as a
member of either political party.
Rosewell Page will be the next
president of the student body. He
would be the obvious choice even
if he were opposed by the best in
either party. He is well qualified.
And in the hour and a half session
Wednesday he showed more maturi-
ty than any of the other candidates.
This is not to say that his perform-
ance was perfect, for it was not. It
was, however, honest. He stated
flatly that he had no platform and
didn’t want one. He confirmed his
faith in the political system and con-
stitution and honor system as being
the best for the University at this
time. He presented few concrete
ideas, however. This will, perhaps,

 

work to his and to the university’s
advantage. Page showed himself to

 

be a conservative and a go-slower,
but he did not leave the impression
of having a closed-mind on any sub-
ject.

The vice-presidential race hangs
in a delicate balance. Ray Robrecht,
with EC and dormitory counselor
experience, might have been ex-
pected to run rough-shod over
Charles Commander in the question
session. He did not. There is no

| doubt Robrecht is the better quali-

fied of the two, but Commander met
him point-on-point. The “Good-
time Charlie” image which has been
built in some minds disappeared be-
hind a serious countenance and log-
ical, if not specific answers, to point-
ed questions. There is ample reason
to, or not to, endorse either can-
didate. Robrecht’s qualifications give
him an edge, but Commander’s per-
formance indicates he would be a
capable officer.

While neither Suttle nor Outman
were over-impressive, Suttle came
out the better for the encoun-
ter. Outman, whose abilities mer-
it consideration, was just too
vague in his answers to specific
questions. Indeed, he was so deliber-
ate that some of the meaning of
his answers was lost. Suttle on
the other hand, did not show the
fight that a candidate facing such
odds would be expected to display.
Interestingly enough, Suttle was the
only one of the five who dissented
on even one question which was
answered by a simple “yes” or “no.”
Whether this was to his advantage
remains to be seen. (The real draw-
back to the whole session was that
one candidate would voice an opin-
ion and the four others would merely
echo the original answer). Outman
certainly must have more ability
than he displayed Wednesday. On
the other hand, Suttle din’t rise much
above par for the group. Being
biased, let’s leave it there.

 

«

candidates to state, individually,
what constructive proposals they
might have to better the campus
situation. The question was admit-
tedly broad and gave each candidate
a great deal of space to state their
proposals.

So what happened? Nothing. Why
were the candidates not able to bring
up on their own accord the weakness
of the IFC for example, a better sys-
tem of honor orientation, or an
analysis of why raincoats and um-
brellas have been disappearing like
whiskey during a prohibition raid?

Doubtless because either they
have not formulated any policies at
the present time, they have none, or
believe in the status quo. This is
only my _ impression but after
listening as closely as possible there
seems to be none other, though I
wish there were.

Admittedly the position of these
men in having to answer questions
before a group put them at a dis-
advantage; nevertheless, they are to
be our leaders and should have
been ready.

I believe that these candidates are
as qualified as a group as any slate
which has been put up since I have
attended W&L. This does not, how-
ever, lessen the impact of the “trial”
Wednesday night because of the
void of ideas for improvement which
was coupled with the inability, as
I saw it, to cope with basic concept
of honor and its applicability here
at Washington and Lee.

 

Forum Indicates
Candidates Are
Lacking Purpose

Offer Only Two Proposals

By MALCOLM BROWNLEE
Friday Columnist

My experience at the forum of
candidates for next year’s Execu-
tive Committee
could be describ-
ed as that of an
idealist becoming
disillusioned.

Before the for-
um started, I hop-
ed and expected
that the candidates
would propose
some concrete
a changes in the

present system.
mnie The naivete of the
idealist can be great indeed.

The candidates constantly begged
the questions put to them. All of
them admitted that some changes
were needed in the University, but
only two changes (making all E.C.
legislative meetings public and mov-
ing dance sets to the Commons)
were proposed. Few professors grad-
ing test papers have ever encountered
greater hemming and hawing than
was displayed by the candidates at
the forum.

All of the candidates have far
greater abilities than they showed
Wednesday night. All of them are in-
telligent; all are leaders. But at the
forum they demonstrated neither
their intelligence nor their ability
to lead. I was particularly disap-
pointed in Robrecht and Suttle
mostly because I expected much
from them. I have been amazed at
times by the leadership abilities of
both of them, but Wednesday night
they failed to live up to my expec-
tations.

Ready-Made Platform Offered To Politicians

By THORNS CRAVEN

Friday Columnist

By now I assume that you all
know that “Heads or Tails” was an
artistic success and a financial flop.
And probably
most of you help-
ed out in this one
way or the other.
At least the Troub
Theatre was filled
every night. I’m
afraid that most
of you missed the
best comedy of the
year, however, if
you passed up the
one night stand in
the Student Union
on Wednesday night. I think that
you will find some reference to this
show elsewhere on this page, but

they needn’t bother you. It must
have been a joke.

What happened was simple enough.
The “Big Five” vying for the “Big
Three” met on neutral ground and
ended up in No Man’s Land. You’ve
all heard the story by now, and I
imagine that you all expected it to
happen sooner or later. It was final-
ly brought to light that nobody really
knows why they’re getting all those
straight party votes. Everybody was
stuck for some suggestions to make
about how to improve on the status
quo. So, once more, in the interest
of better government, bigger busi-
ness, and the high ideals and tradi-
tions of Washington and Lee, I’m
going to present the ready made
platform. This will be good for any
office (void after January 1, 1958),
and can be trotted out at any party
beer party or fraternity speech. It

 

will center around answers to the|

following question, which was posed
and reposed at the Wednesday Night
Fight (under the sanction of James
B. Norris, of course).

The question is: “Mr. Candidate,
what improvements do you propose
to make around the dear old campus
here in tradition bound Lexington?”

The answers are (stage directions
in parentheses):

1. “I’m glad you asked that ques-
tion.” (After saying this, tilt your
head, button your coat, shift your
weight, and take the cotton out of
your ears.)

2. “Of course.”
above.)

3. “Yes, I think so, and I’m pre-
pared to do so, but of course I
will stay within the bounds of the
System as it is set up now, and I
wouldn't want to tamper with a

(Same pose as

 

thing like that.” (There is no proper
stance with this answer, so fake it.)

As you have no doubt noticed,
these answers are rather ridiculous.
Don’t let that steer you away from
using them. On the contrary, they
are very effective for opening re-
marks. But as the questioning pro-
gresses, and as you begin to under-
stand the question (look back at the
question as it is printed above so
you will be completely familiar with
it) you may want to go on into more
complex answers, and perhaps even
some concrete ones. Be careful!

4. “I’ve had an idea for a long
time now about that, and I think
that I will be able to do some-
thing about it if I am elected.” (In
your stance be sure to appear that
you know what “that” is. Ignorance
on this point is fatal.)

5. “Although I stand on my record

 

I realize that steps forward must
be taken. This is why I advocate
fixing all the forward steps on
campus.” (An air of experience
can be used with this answer to
great advantage. Speak softly, and
parry any kick.)

6. “Don’t misunderstand me, I’m
all for getting everything on the
record. As a matter of fact, I’ve got-
ten the glee club to make a little
campaign record and I want you all
to hear it. And by the way, did
you all know that I can sing too?”
(This appeals to minority groups.)

7. “Yes, I do have some changes
that I want made, and if elected I
will do my best to initiate the prop-
er action. Unfortunately I am not at
liberty to discuss these changes at
this time, but I will make a public
statement at the big Party Victory

Vardaman Offers Proposals
To Executive Committee

Editor—Friday Edition
Ring-tum Phi
Lexington, Va.

Dear Sir:

The Honor System at Washington
and Lee has recently been the topic
of much discussion. On the whole
I am in favor of the present Honor
System, but I do belive that there
are two procedural reforms that
would improve it. I hope that this
letter will serve to stimulate student
interest and support of these ideas:

Instead of the present two-thirds
vote of the Executive Committee
to convict a student of an honor
violation, I believe that an unan-
imous decision should be required.
It has been argued that it would
be practically impossible to secure
a conviction if a unanimous de-
cision were required, and _ this
would bring about the downfall of
the Honor System. This makes it
seem necessary to have a few con-
victions every year to make the
Honor System work. Is this true?
There also arises the question of
whether or not a man should be
convicted if four people have a
reasonable doubt to his guilt. Ad-..
mittedly there will be human error
under either system, but would it
not be better to err in letting a
guilty student remain here than in
convicting an inocent student and
placing a permanent blemish on
his life record?

A second proposal would re-
quire the Executive Commitee to
present the suspended student with
an exact statement of charges be--
fore he is required to make his de-
cision concerning his option to
voluntarily withdraw from the
University. I make this proposal
for the simple reason that in all
fairness to the student involved, I
believe he should know the speci-
fic charge or charges against him
before he makes a decision that
will affect his entire life.

I believe that these two proposals
should be considered in order that
students brought before the Execu-
tive Committee will receive justice
in the fullest sense of its meaning.

Prays, Makes Catch;
Miracle? No, Skill

Besides playing West Virginia and
a snow storm at the same time Mon-
day, the W&L baseball team had to
fight a strong wind.

The wind produced the game’s
wierd play in the fifth inning. Jim
Procopio, West Virginia outfielder,
hit what appeared to be a routine
fly ball to center. But the wind
played a prank.

W&L leftfielder Sandy Smith, who
had come in to back up on the catch,
suddenly saw the ball falling right
at him. He said a prayer, dropped
to his knees, and caught the ball.

Hampden-Sydney managed only
two firsts, both by its number one

edged Skip Essex in the fastest 440
that W&L has seen in several years.
Then the 6-0 speedster handed

Caperton had a :50.5 in the 440

W&L’s baseball team split what
appeared at times to be a double-
header snowball fight with West Vir-
ginia University Monday at Morgan-
town.

The Generals lost the first game, |

3-0, but won the second with a four |
run rally in the seventh (and last) |
inning, 4-3.

Brice Gamber, freshman left-
hander, was tagged for the loss in
the first game, although he gave
up only five hits.

A lack of punch at the plate hurt
the Generals, who were blanked by
Mountaineer righthander Tom Shaf-
er, the pitcher whom they beat last
year in Lexington, 1-0, in thirteen
innings.

The Mountaineers scored single
tallies in the second, fourth, and
sixth innings, handing Gamber his
first loss of season against no wins.

Irwin Finishes
Translations

George J. Irwin, associate pro-
fessor of Romance languages at
Washington and Lee University, is
the translator of an English edition
of French sociologist Raymond
Aron’s highly-acclaimed Introduc-
tion to the Philosophy of History,
published this week by the Beacon
Press.

The 349-page volume is the sec-
ond work by Aron translated by
Professor Irwin to be published in
the past year. In August, his rendi-
tion of France: Steadfast and Chang-
ing was published by the Harvard
University Press.

Professor Irwin began
the latest book in 1954,
completed its translation when he
was requested in 1958 to work on
the shorter book on France. Be-
cause of printing delays with the
philosophy study, the later transla-
tion was published first, Professor
Irwin explained.

Aron, professor of sociology at
the Sorbonne in Paris, is the author
of numerous other books and is a
regular contributor to the Paris
newspaper Figaro. The Introduction
to the Philosophy of History has
been accepted by scholars as a
masterwork since its first appearance
in 1938. Professor Irwin’s translation
is the first in English.

A graduate of Washington and
Lee, Professor Irwin has been a
member of the faculty since 1925. In
1921-22 he held a teaching fellow-
ship at Princeton and from 1922 to
1925, he was a Herbert Montgomery
Bergen Fellow at Princeton.

ROTC Has Federal Inspection

Each year about this time all the
various ROTC units across the coun-
try are required to undergo a feder-
ally-sponsored inspection, such as
was conducted here Tuesday and
Wednesday.

As is the case with all the other
federally-inspected schools with
ROTC units, W&L’s inspection was
performed by a team of U.S. Army
officers on ROTC duty. The team
was headed by Colonel Richie, the
Professor of Military Science and
Tactics at Pennsylvania State Uni-
versity.

Rounding out the team of three
inspectors were Major Dahmer of
Bucknell University and Captain
Whaley of the University of Del-
aware.

Tuesday evening at eight marked
the formal beginning of the inspec-
tion, with the team looking over the
general administrative and supply
activities. On Wednesday the team
was briefed by Maj. Roxbury, W&L
PMS&T, at eight in the morning,
followed by visits to the classrooms
and drill field throughout the day.

A conference between Col. Richie,
Maj. Roxbury, and President Cole at
three-thirty formally ended the in-
spection, although Maj. Dahmer
took one more look at the Cadet
Corps at the regular Corps Day
Review at 4:45.

 

Commenting on the rating which

the Corps and ROTC Detachment re-
ceived, Maj. Roxbury stated that the
inspecting team found both to be
satisfactory and were generally very
complimentary.

Colonel Richie, the chief inspect-
ing officer, is the PMS&T for a
cadet corps of some 2600 students,
as compared with W&L’s Cadet
Corps of 300.

Richmond last week with a jump of
41’ 11”. Last week he jumped 41’
10 5/8” to break the old school
record by a foot. Kell also scored
a first in the high jump with a 59”
jump.

Following Sackett and Kell in the
scoring were Jim Hickey with
eight; Jim Parker with eight; and
Ken Kowalski with six points.

Other first place winners for the
Generals included Stoney Duffey,
mile (4:58); Mike Shank, two-mile,
(10:41.4); Ed Jansen, high hurdles,
(:16.3); Ashley Wiltshire, low hur-
dles, (:29.3); and Dave Munroe, shot
put, Gz 2.

Both hurdle races proved inter-
esting. In the high hurdles, W&L
took the first four places with Jan-
sen, Preston Lancaster, Ed Croft, and
John Pearson finishing in that order.
Hampden-Sydney entered two men
in the event, but both men dropped
out when W&L’s four-some breezed
into a quick lead.

In the low hurdles, Ashley Wilt-
shire captured his first win of the
year. For the past two weeks, he
has finished second, but yesterday
he led the pack.

Shank was trying to better his best
performance in the two-mile yester-
day, but the “Iron Horse” fell ten
seconds short in his attempt. He
ran a beautiful race, but he did not
have any competition to push him.

Of course you can work up vari-

can vary in complexity (depending
upon whether or not you are a

to listen then it’s still a lot of fun.
But, I repeat, be careful. Next time
your party might be in the office.

A ROBE BY ANY OTHER NAME

As Commencement Day draws near, the question on everyone’s
lips is: “How did the different disciplines come to be marked by
academic robes with hoods of different colors?” Everybody —
but everybody—is asking it. I mean I haven’t been able to walk
ten feet on any campus in America without somebody grabs my
elbow and says, “How did the different disciplines come to be
marked by academic robes with hoods of different colors, hey?”

This, I must say, is not the usual question asked by collegians
who grab my elbow. Usually they say, ‘Hey, Shorty, got a
Marlboro?” And this is right and proper. After all, are they not
collegians, and, therefore, the nation’s leaders in intelligence
and discernment? And do not intelligence and discernment de-
mand the tastiest in tobacco flavor and smoking pleasure? And
does not Marlboro deliver a flavor that is uniquely mellow, a
selectrate filter that is easy drawing, a pack that is soft, a box

that is hard? You know it!

 

But I digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes.
A doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears
green, a master of arts wears white, a doctor of humanities wears
crimson, a master of library science wears lemon yellow. Why?
Why, for example, should a master of library science wear lemon

yellow?

Well sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to
March 29, 1844. On that date the first public library in the
United States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.
Sigafoos’s neighbors were of course wildly grateful—all, that

is, except Wrex Todhunter.

Mr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both
men had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had
chosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.
Sigafoos knew all the latest steps, like the Missouri Compromise
Mambo, the Shay’s Rebellion Schottische, and the James K.
Polk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all
owing to a wound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans.
(He was struck by a falling praline.)

Consumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos’s
library, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library.
This he did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr.
Sigafoos. ‘What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven’t got?” Mr.
Todhunter kept asking himself, and finally the answer came to

him: books.

So Mr. Todhunter stocked his library with lots of dandy books
and soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.
But Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began
serving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. There-
upon, Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea
with sugar. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with
sugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter began serving
tea with sugar and cream and lemon.

This, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter be-
cause he had the only lemon tree in town—in fact, in the entire
state of North Dakota—and since that day lemon yellow has of
course been the color on the academic robes of library science,

(Incidentally, the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his library
and moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There
were, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but,
alas, there was no cream because the cow was not introduced

to California until 1931 by John Wayne.)

Americans in all fifty states. Welcome aboard!
