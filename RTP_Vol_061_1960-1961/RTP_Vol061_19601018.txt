Ed Croft, John Paul Gain F

Bipartisan Representation Shown
In Results of Monday Elections

Last night, Oct. 17, Ed Croft and John Paul were elected
Executice Committeemen from the freshman academic and
law classes. Croft, the University Party candidate for Freshman
EC, defeated Bill Noell by a plurality of 68 votes. John Paul
defeated Mal Lassman for the EC post from the freshman law

class.

Croft is a KA pledge from Atlanta,*

Georgia, where he attended the
Westminster Schools. At Westmin-
ster, he was the President of his
Junior Class; was outstanding in
football, wrestling, and track; and
was the President of the Westmin-
ster Honor Council in his Senior
year.

Croft has already begun to show
his potential and to prove that he
definitely possesses the qualities
of leadership and competence
which are requisite for the posi-
tion of Executive Committeeman.
He is the President of his KA
Pledge Class and is playing Fresh-
man football.

Ed Croft said that he was honored
by his election to this important po-
sition and that he would strive to
live up to the W&L tradition and
the faith entrusted to him by his
classmates.

An SAE freshman, A. J. Barranco,
nominated Croft at the Assembly last
night. Barry Greene, a ZBT, made
the seconding speech. John Kirkley,
Phi Gam pledge president, nominat-
ed Bill Noell. Bill Cromley seconded
the nomination.

John Paul, the new Executive
Committeeman from the freshman
law class, is a Pi Kappa Phi gradu-
ate of Washington and Lee. He grad-
uated two years ago Magna Cum
Laude with honors as a physics ma-
jor.

During his undergraduate years at
Washington and Lee he was on the
Library Committee and was an of-
ficer in his fraternity. Recently he
has been writing law review com-
ments. He will also serve as the As-
sistant Defense Attorney in the Mock

 

Despite Deemphasis

The Randolph-Macon game Sat-
urday marked the first time in thir-
ty-seven years that a Washington
and Lee football team has won five
straight games. Not since 1923, when
the Generals defeated Western
Maryland, Kentucky, St. Johns,
V.P.L, and Virginia, has a similar
record been compiled

The present streak includes the
last game of the 1959 season.

Glee Club Concert Will Feature Extras

The Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Glee Club will make its first ap-
pearance at 8:30 p.m. Friday night in
Doremus Gymnasium. The occasion
is the annual Parent’s Weekend Con-
cert.

Featured in this year’s perform-
ance will be the John Graham Brass
Choir, under the direction of Mr.
Robert Stewart. The “Cappereles,”
a newly-organized freshman singing
group, will entertain at intermission.

 

Trial. Last year, John was an In-
structor in physics at the University
of Virginia. He is a member of PDP

Other freshman law elections were
held last night. Pete Dauk was chos-
en as President of the class. Alan
Caldwell is the new Vice-President
and Paul Boswell is class secretary.

W. and L. Debaters Attend
Public Affairs Conference

For the first time, Washington and
Lee entered a team in the Virginia
Conference on Public Affairs held at
the University of Virginia on Fri-
day, October 14. Nine members of
the debate team, along with Mr.
Willian Chaffin, Debate Director,
traveled to Charlottesville for this
Conference to discuss the question:
“What should be done to provide
adequate medical care for all Unit-
ed States citizens?”

At the conclusion of the day’s ac-
tivities Washington and Lee’s Rich-
ard McEnally had won one of five
gavels presented to the most effec-

chosen by his discussion group to
present and defend one of the two
resolutions debated on the floor of
the Legislative Assembly, and Peter
Straub had won the admiration of
the entire Conference by his skillful
use of parliamentary procedure on
the floor of the Legislative Assembly.

ing against such debate powers as
North Carolina, Davidson, Univer-
sity of Virginia, University of Rich-
mond, Randolph-Macon, and others.
In all, eleven schools were repre-
sented at Charlottesville.

Bill Buice, Whit Fitzgerald, Lon At-
kins, and George Birdsong also rep-
| resented W&L at the Conference.

 

The Glee Club this year will be
made up of more than sixty Wash-
ington and Lee undergraduates.
Dr. Stewart, Assistant Professor
of Fine Arts, is director. Don Pard-
ington, a Phi Gam senior, is presi-
dent of the club, and Tom Ride-
out and Dave Spencer are librari-
ans.

Guggenheim Loan Popular Exhibit

Paintings from the John Simon
Guggenheim collection are now be-
ing shown in the West Wing of the
Letitia Pate Evans Dining Hall. As
usual, the paintings exhibited in this
wing are of a modern nature. There
are representative works of such
artists as Harry Bertoia, Cesar Dom-
ela, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Leger,
Jean Metzinger, and Laszlo Moholy-
Nagy.

One of the more widely known
masterpieces is Mare Chagall’s
“Village Street.” Chagall was
born in Vitebsk, Russia. His father
was a worker in a fish shop and
Mare was one of ten childen. Af-
ter studying art for two years in
Petrograd, Chagall was sent to
Paris about the time of World War
I. He has also lived in Venice,
where he won an _ International
Prize for Engraving in 1948. His
paintings show the effects of his
early environment on a_ highly
imaginative mind. His works are
characterized by a kind of lyric

poetry in color and usually con-
tain lovers, flowers, barnyard ani-
mals, and a sun or moon.

There are also two works of Vasily
Kandinsky in this collection. Kan-
dinsky’s work has had a profound
effect on contemporary painting. He
is the originator of non-objective
painting.

Paul Klee, a late Swiss painter,
said to be “one of the most original,
inventive, and amusing artists in
modern times,” is also represented.

The “Frightened Rabbit” of Franz
Mare, a Bavarian painter, is exhibit-
ed. Dr. Junkin, the head of the W&L
Art Department, says that Heinrich
Campendonk’s “Animals and Flow-
ers” is one of his favorites in this
collection. Campendonk’s painting is
best described as “lyric cubism.”

These paintings have been loaned
to the University for a six-month
period by Mr. Harry F. Guggenheim,
the President of the Board of Trus-
tees of the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Foundation.

Openings Dance Arrangements

Far Along Road To Completion

“The preparations for the 1960
Openings Dance Set are in full
swing,” President Pearce Hardwick
announced last night. The plans for
the Friday night cocktail party are
completed.

As announced last week, “The
Greatest Show on Earth” is the
theme of this year’s Openings.

The decorations committee, head-
ed by Pete Agelasto and John White,
has announced that the decor of the
gym will be completely different
from that of past sets. The false ceil-
ing is gone. It has been replaced by
a huge red and black crepe paper
circus tent.

The art work is on the road to
completion. On the wall opposite
the bandstand there will be a full-
length mural showing all the col-
orful events seen under a “Big
Top.” The man on the flying tra-
peze, the lion-tamer, the tight-
rope walker, and the beautiful girls
on horses will be depicted.

On either side of the bandstand
there will be murals showing at-
tractions found outside the main
tent; animals, the hilarious clowns,
and all the circus sideshow attrac-
tions. In addition, much material de-
picting other scenes of circus life has
been received from the Ringling
Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Cir-
cus, presently located at Sarasota,
Florida.

Hardwick said that all the com-
mittees were working “toward giv-
ing an accurate picture of the ex-
uberance and color of circus life

evening’s third selection, “As I Ride
By,” by John Kernochan. Wes Os-
tergren will present the famous Por-
gy and Bess ballad, “It Ain’t Nec-
essarily So,” as the fifth selection.
John Baker, a freshman member of
the Glee Club, will be featured in
the final presentation, “Landsight-
ing” by Edvard Grieg.

The Glee Club will open the even-
ing’s entertainment with the Wash-
ington and Lee Alma Mater, “Col-
lege Friendships.” This will be fol-
lowed by a selection from Bach,
“Good Fellows Be Merry.”

Following Channell’s selo, the
group will present “Widerspruch,”
by Shubert. The first half of the
performance will conclude with
“It Ain’t Necessarily So.”

“I Got Plenty O’ Nuttin’,” another
Porgy and Bess tune, will open the
second portion of the program. This
will be followed by an unusual ren-
dition of the beautiful ballad, “Come
To Me, Bend To Me!”

“IT Could Have Danced All Night,”
a popular tune from the musical
comedy My Fair Lady will follow.
The program will close with the
“Washington and Lee Swing.”

The John Graham Brass Choir

while retaining a proper atmos-
phere for the dances.”

At 4 o’clock on Friday afternoon
the Set officially opens. Beta Theta
Pi then gives a cocktail party in hon-
or of Set President Hardwick. This
party is scheduled for the Pine Room
of the Mayflower Hotel. However, if
weather permits, it will take place in
the center of Red Square directly
behind the Beta House.

In either event, TNT Trible, “The
Walking Drummer,” will enter-
tain the guests with his famous
music and earthy humor. Scotch
and Bourbon will be served at the
Beta party.

The dance band of Ray Eberle will
entertain at the evening dance. His
music is closely allied with that of
Glenn Miller’s, a fact due to Eberle’s
association with the great Miller
band of the late Thirties and early
Forties.

At the concert on Saturday after-
noon the Four Freshmen will ap-

Faculty Panels
For Weekend
Are Announced

There will be many discussions
around the campus for the benefit of
the parents who will be visiting this
weekend. Dr. E. B. Hamer is re-
sponsible for most of the arrange-
ments for the Parents’ Weekend. A
record number of more than 900
parents have already made reserva-
tions for the program.

Dr. Marion Junkin, professor of
fine arts, will conduct a program en-
titled “From Realism to Cubism” as
a special addition to the activities
of Parents’ Weekend. Dr. Junkin
will present a demonstration from
the stage of the duPont Auditorium
at 8 p.m. this Friday. He plans to
spend about fifteen minutes painting
a realistic sketch of a live subject,
and then turn to the more modern,
cubist style. As he paints, Dr. Junk-
in will discuss the difference in
technique as shown by his two ex-
amples.

There will be a Chemistry Semin-

Faculty Gets S&U Reports,
Number of U’s Goes Up

S and U reports for this year show |
that 173 members of the Class of 1964
have received a grade of U. The re- |
maining 152 freshmen have received
an § rating. |

By comparison, this year’s fresh- |
man class shows an increase of 33)
students receiving U’s over the 141
members of the Class of 1963, wien |
received the same mark last year. |
The increase in this year’s freshman |
class, however, has been greatly af- |
fected by the new ruling which)
raised the value of the U to corre-|
spond with a grade of D, whereas it |
had only ineluded F’s and F plus’s
heretofore.

A breakdown of the report
shows 81 freshmen receiving one
U, 51 receiving two U’s, 32 re-
ceiving three U’s, eight receiving
four U’s, and one receiving five
U’s. The Class of 1963 compiled the
following statistics: 84 with one
U, 37 with two U’s, 12 with three
U's, and two with five U’s,

The purpose of the S and U reports
is primarily to call a freshman’s at-
tention to a particular subject in
which he is not doing the required
work. The grades are not registered
permanently on a student’s record.

Dean Gilliam has the following to
say concerning the S and U grades:
“The grades, whether satisfactory or
not, should be regarded as definitive
with regard to future work.”

All freshmen must see their fac-
ulty advisors as soon as possible to
receive their individual reports.

Prep and High Schools
Are Visited by Faculty
In Stepped-up Recruiting

Several members of the Washing-
ton and Lee faculty have begun a

| series of visits to preparatory and

high schools in connection with the
university's admissions program.

The program of faculty visits
is Washington and Lee’s attempt
to establish some liaison between
teaching faculty and secondary
school students, according to
Frank J. Gilliam, dean of stu-
dents at the University.

Dean Gilliam also points out that
the new program helps relieve his
office in fulfilling requests for the
various college programs in Virginia
secondary schools.

During October, three members
of the Washington and Lee facul-
ty will visit in Richmond, Charles-
ton, West Virginia and Martins-
ville. One visit has already been
made in Roanoke.

Dr. A. Ross Borden, Jr., professor
of English, will attend the college
program at Thomas Jefferson High
School in Richmond on Oct. 13. This
program will include all Riehmond
high schools.

A second English professor, Dr.
Sidney Coulling, will travel to
Charleston, West Virginia, on Oct.
31. Dr. William Jenks, professor of
history, will speak at the high schools
in Martinsville.

In past years, few Washington and
Lee professors have paid visits to
secondary schools. This year’s pro-

 

eon in his honor at the R. E. Lee
Hotel.

gram marks the first of scheduled
visits to as many schools as possible.

 

from specialists and to promote ac-
curacy, clarity, and interest in writ-
ing and editing of legal topics. The
seminar will not deal with libel and
other laws directly concerning the
press.

Visiting lecturers for the semin-
ar will be James A. Ejichner, a
member of the Department of Law
of the City of Richmond; and An-
thony Lewis, Supreme Court cor-
respondent for the New York
Times.

Five members of Washington and
Lee’s law faculty will round out the
legal discussions.

The seminar is expected to at-
tract journalists from Virginia, West
Virginia, North Carolina and the
District of Columbia. Registration
will close November 15, according to
Professor O. W. Riegel, director of
the Lee Memorial Journalism Foun-
dation.

Three students from the Wash-
ington and Lee department of
journalism and communications
and three from the School of Law
will attend the sessions.

In addition to lectures, the semin-
ar program calls for a tour of the law
library at the University, opportuni-
ties for consultation with lecturers
and a motion picture of a criminal
proceeding accompanied by explana-
tory remarks.

Newsmen participating in the sem-
inar will be sent advanced informa-
tion with suggested reading assign-
ments in preparation for the sessions.

Post-seminar plans feature an
assignment in local legal report-
ing. Each participating journalist
will be given a selected appellate
court decision on which to write
a news story. These stories will in
turn be read and criticized by a
committee from the department of
journalism and communications
and the School of Law. Certificates
will be presented to those partici-
pants who complete all the work,

This is the first such seminar to
held at Washington and Lee. The
University has sponsored previous
seminars on libel and other laws di-
rectly concerning the press.

A five-man advisory committee
has been established for the semin-
ar. Committee members include M.
Carl Andrews, Roanoke, past chair-
men of the National Conference of
Editorial Writers; Chief Justice John

Troubadours Rehearsing
Christopher Fry Play

The Troubadour Theatre of Wash-
ington and Lee University will open
its 1960 season with Christopher
Fry’s verse comedy, The Lady’s Not
For Burning. This fanciful drama
deals with the germination of a
beautiful love between a charming
maiden accused of witchcraft and a
soldier of fortune seeking to end
his life. The play’s 15th Century set-
ting helps make it an excellent ve-
hicle for a cast composed predomin-
ately of favorite Troubadour actors.

The role of the lady who is not
for burning, originally written for
and created on Broadway by Pamela
Brown, is played by Margaret Da-
vis, a resident of Lexington with a
long string of Troubadour credits.
Her leading man, playing an intel-
lectual vagrant, is John Dunnell,
who was featured in all three pro-
ductions here last season.

The supporting cast is also full of
familiar names. Dick Roberts, whose
comic ad libbing in “Taming of the
Shrew“ will long be remembered on
the campus, will present the hard
working clerk, Richard. Bob Allen,
seen in The Devil’s Disciple, chases
witches again as the dogmatic mayor
of Cool Cleary. Undertaking comic
roles for the first time as the foppish
brothers are Ron Alenstein and Firth
Spiegel.

Reform Needed

The seventy-six freshmen who did not pledge a fraternity
during rush week became eligible for deferred rush as of last
Friday. Their reasons for not pledging during rush range from
hesitation to choose between two fraternities to the disappoint-
ment either of receiving no bid at all or of not receiving a bid
from a much admired fraternity.

Many of these boys have expressed a desire to join a social
fraternity. Those who held back because they were not sure
which fraternity to join have, by this time, made up their minds.
Those who were frightened by the rush of their first week at
Washington and Lee have for the most part regained their com-
posure and are ready to face the already hostile ranks of fra-
ternity men who have settled down to the year’s routine and who
now regard all freshmen as “‘pledges.”’

Even after seeing their fellow freshmen return from the
first “‘line-ups’’ and hearing them complain of the many duties
involved in pledging, these boys are anxious to join a fraterni-
ty. Despite the valiant efforts of the Campus Club to provide
entertainment for these boys, several have admitted to us that
they ‘feel left out.” They have realized that to enjoy the social
conveniences which their classmates take for granted, they must

join a fraternity.

We feel that these boys do not get a fair chance to look at
the fraternities under the present rules of deferred rush. Most
of the fraternities are fairly well satisfied with their pledge clas-
ses. Some of them are simply not interested in deferred rushing
under any circumstances. Others look on deferred rushees as
boys whom nobody else wanted. (We know of at least one boy
who received bids from three fraternities but turned them down
in hopes of receiving another more desirable bid during defer-

red rush.)

These boys should be given a better opportunity to see the
fraternities in which they are interested. Under the present sys-
tem, their only method of communication with the fraternities
is through the pledge classes (unless they have the courage to
walk into one of the houses and announce that they are in-
terested). In any case they are required to approach some fra-
ternity man, pledge or active, and ask to be allowed to come to
the house for a meal or some other function.

We suggest that the first Saturday of deferred rush be
set aside as a day of formal rush with certain hours during which
fraternities may make dates with rushees and during which in-
terested freshmen might make dates with the fraternities.

If all fraternities would cooperate, the deferred freshman
would be given a chance to see all the men in the fraternity and
the active members would have an opportunity to meet those
boys in whom their pledges express an interest.

We feel that the present system leaves too much respon-
sibility with the freshmen, both pledges and rushees, and that
some of this responsibility should fall on the shoulders of the

upperclassmen.

Both the deferred freshman and the fraternities would bene-

fit from the new program.

 

Poll Finds Nixon’s Campus Prestige

Due To Parents,

By GERRY OUELLETTE and
WYNN KINTZ

With less than three weeks to
Election Day, the nation’s “sampl-
ing” pollsters still find the presi-
dential candidates running neck-
and-neck. The climate of opinion
within the confines of W&L differs,
however, from the findings of these
pollsters, at least so far as we can
ascertain.

The sentiment shown by the stu-
dents for Vice-President Nixon ap-
pears overwhelming. For example, in
a poll conducted at random last week
in front of Washington Hall, sixteen
out of twenty-five students expres-
sed their preference for Vice-Presi-

dent Nixon over Senator John Ken- |

nedy.

We find this simple result ex-
tremely puzzling. Could it be that
the pollsters’ estimates are in er-
ror? Will Nixon swamp Senator
Kennedy despite the predictions of
a tight race? Of course, this out-
come is always a possibility; past
experience, however, indicates
otherwise.

May we now offer various ex-
planations which may possibly clar-
ify this matter. First, this strong pro-
Nixon sentiment here might rest on
the fact that Republican sentiment
in Lexington may have rubbed off
on the students. (Lexington went for
Ike in ’52 and ’56.) This assumption,
however, seems meaningless. W&L
student contact with Lexingtonians
is, at best, non-political. Moreover,
it is doubtful whether mature col-
lege students would be swayed by
any such pressures.

Second, one might think that the
faculty’s tendencies would influence
student favoritism. This possibili-
ty, we maintain, has merit. The stu-
dent’s mind (definitely the more
open in a toss-up between him and
a professor) looks for cues from his
entourage. The professor remains for

 

Not Professors

him the more infallible of places;
consequently, an influence is born.
However, faculty influence falls
greatly when the count is taken:
professors split on their individual
choices very near the 50-50 mark.

We advance another explana-
tion, and to us, what seems the
most logical reason. Economics
offers us, to a certain degree, the
best answer thus far. It is not un-
known that W&L students are,
on the whole, products of families
of means, and that many students’
fathers head, manage, or control
interests in large industrial con-
cerns. Since, traditionally, the Re-

Allen Exposes
Hollins Gestapo

By HARVEY ALLEN

While dissecting the latest edition
of the Hollins Columns, we came
across a story about a recent meet-
ing of the Student Government As-
sociation. We did a double take when
we read the following paragraph:

Members of house board, who
carried out the room check sug-
gested by the executive council,
reportedly found no girls remain-
ing in their dormitory rooms dur-
ing the compulsory meeting.”
Good grief!

First, it would be well to remem-
ber that Hollins has an honor sys-
tem, much like ours. It covers ap-
proximately the same things ours
does, with obvious modifications for
a young ladies college. Although
their executive council is not exact-
ly like our Executive Committee, it
is similar.

Second, consider that this S.G.A.

Florida Democrats Mend Fences, Regain Strength

By PETER JAMES LEE

Former Editor of the Ring-tum Phi

It is now possible to venture a few
tentative comments on the Florida
political picture. Lyndon Johnson
spoke in Pensacola two days ago,
winding up his two day blitz of Flor-
ida. Before his visit, things were
pretty rough for the Democrats.
Governor Collins is staunchly pro-
Kennedy, but he’s not very strong
any more because of what most Flor-
idans feel is his too liberal position.
The titular head of the party is now
Farris Bryant, the Democrat-nom-
inee for governor and a shoo-in for
the post. While Bryant is a Harvard
law man, an extremely brilliant and
capable legislator, he is also an ex-
treme conservative. Bryant and the

other Democrats running for state |

offices met in Jacksonville several
weeks ago and drafted a set of con-
servative principles as a platform—
a position which explicitly repudi-

ated the national platform. All the!

state-wide candidates said then they
would vote Democratic, but would
not campaign for the national ticket.

Sen. Spessard Holland made a
similar statement. Sen. George
Smathers, Kennedy’s southeastern
campaign manager was, of course
more strongly for the ticket, but
also has attacked the national plat-
form. The few liberal Democrats
in the state haven't had much to
say—if they did say much, they
would do more harm than good.

The regular GOP organization has
been working harder than ever be-
fore. There’s the state-wide “Flori-
dians for Nixon-Lodge” organiza-
tion separate from the regular GOP
which has also organized in just
about every county. Before Johnson
spoke in Florida, the tide was strong
for Nixon.

Although Florida will perhaps be
the major battleground in the South,
I think the picture has changed con-

 

siderably this week. Johnson’s whis-
tle-stop tour was successful in gath-
ering large crowds, but most import-
ant, successful in drawing together
the diverse wings of the party. Now
the conservative elements under
Bryant have come out “enthusiasti-
cally” for Kennedy (in Bryant’s own
words). Sen. Holland, Sen Smathers,
and the entire congressional delega-
tion are now 100 per cent behind the
national ticket, and the talk about
the platform has been pushed aside.
Johnson made a big hit with his
“Y’all are my kind of folks” pitch,
and Lady Bird’s Southern accent was
drooling.

Surprisingly, civil rights doesn’t
seem to be an issue in Florida. The
religious issue and foreign affairs,
in that order, appear to be foremost
in voters’ minds. However, the area
where one would expect the strong-
est anti-Catholic sentiment is in
Baptist, Anglo-Saxon, Old South
Cracker West Florida’s Third Con-
gressional District—from Pensacola
east through Tallahassee—and
fortunately for the Democrats, West
Florida is traditionally the strong-
est loyalist section in the state. There
is little talk of Nixon among the “av-
erage” people of this section. Of
course, the talk at the country clubs,
Episcopal and Presbyterian church-
es, Rotary clubs and cocktail parties
is almost all the way Nixon, but
that’s not surprising. The important
thing is that the Third District, es-
pecially after Johnson’s visit is, I
think, fairly solid in the Democratic
column. The only major threat was
Faubus’ name on the ticket, and the
Arkansas governor officially request-
ed Florida’s secretary of state to take

Recent Argument A gainst Senator
Goldwater Distorts I nformation

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

In last Friday’s Ring-tum Phi a
column appeared which was devoted
to an attack on Senator Barry Gold-
water and his book. The main point
of the attack was that Goldwater
isn’t really a conservative because a
conservative is one who wants to
preserve the present form of gov-
ernment, and Goldwater actually
wants to change it. This makes Gold-
water a radical. Besides indicating
a definite dislike of Goldwater, the
article proved little else but the
danger of becoming tied to words
whose meaning is largely emotional
and changes according to who uses
them.

The “conservatives” of today gen-
erally advocate a minimum of gov-
ernment interference in the affairs of
men. They were formerly called lib-
erals, and were opposed to the con-
servatives of their day who advocat-
ed government control of nearly ev-
erything. Gradually the liberals won,
and when they had, seeked to main-
tain the system they established.
Then, through the mysterious al-
chemy of politics, they become con-
servatives and those who opposed
them liberals. This is an outrageous
over-simplification, but explains
why Goldwater considers himself a
conservative, to the apparent con-
fusion of some.

Other than attacking Gold-
water’s use of the term “conserva-
tive,” the article confined itself to
stating some of his positions and
then stating the writer’s disagree-
ment. While this may be an ad-
mirable statement of a personal
credo, it is hardly a valid criticism
of a book.

One of Goldwater’s positions
which the article held up to scorn
was the one opposed to social secur-
ity. Social security is so generally
accepted that an attack on it is re-
garded as evidence of insanity. The
reaction is: “He’s against social se-
curity. (Isn’t he dumb?)” Nothing
more is said. Social security is one of
this age’s ikons, and nothing more
need be said.

But the reason people are opposed
to social security is that it is compul-
sory, it is governmental interference
in the individual’s right to use his
earnings as he sees fit. A man has
no choice as to whether he will par-
ticipate or not. Mr. Goldwater, a con-
servative (by his definition), one
who is opposed to government inter-
ference into private affairs, is thus
opposed to social security. If you
grant his premise, his logie is sound.
To attack his position, you must at-
tack his premise.

The article ended by agreeing
with the Pravda review which
called the book “dangerous.” This
should mean either that the book
should be burned, or that it is so
forceful as to endanger the cur-

 

rently popular political attitude.
We must presume that an earnest
liberal would be opposed to book-
burning (except in the obvious
case of “Little Black Sambo” and
“Huckleberry Finn”) and accept
the alternative, that the book must
be a good defense of the conserva-
tive position and consequently a
telling attack on that of the lib-
erals.

It is currently fashionable, among
the so-called educated class, to be
liberal. Therein lies the greatest
danger to liberalism: too many of its
new recruits are only capable of
pointing and crying “Troglodyte!
Fascist! McCarthyite!” and seem to
be unable to state a solid intellectual
basis for their position. They might
be compared to the average college
student of thirty years ago who went
about crying “Red!” It is the con-
servatives who are now breaking the
ikons, and you can’t stop them by
crying heresy.

 

Reporter Urges
UN Resolution

By GEORGE BIRDSONG

Along with many other Americans,
I find myself wondering why the
U.S. does not take the offensive in
our struggle with international Com-
munism. Is it that we have been
cleverly convinced by the Russian
propaganda that they are not the
most imperialistic and colonial pow-
er in the world today?

Let’s reveal the facts and then
point a finger at the real villain
USSR. In the UN this year “colon-
ialism” is one of the dirtiest words
used. Everyone repeats that the co-
lonial era is finished, and that all
colonies must be liberated immed-
iately.

No delegates gave more lip ser-
vice to this principle than Khrush-
chevy when he said it is time “to
mount the final offensive against
colonialism.” He then continued by
saying “colonial administration in
all its forms should be abolished
completely.”

Why then has no Western delegate
risen to offer for Assembly vote a
resolution applying these universally
sound principles to the only remain-
ing major colonial administration,
the Soviet Empire? Add Red China,
and you have the two nations that
are continuing to expand at the ex-
pense of other peoples.

Both are Communist countries,
and all told, these two nations now
rule a colonial empire that covers
one fourth of the earth’s surface
and includes 18 major colonies, with
1.4 million square miles of territory
and a colonial population of 139 mil-
lion. This empire has expanded rap-

and Joe Kennedy’s death in a plane
with a Texas Baptist—these are the
things that appeal to the Crackers,
and you can count on West Florida
for the Democrats.

The picture in the rest of the
state is more difficult to assess.
Central Florida—the orange grove
county—is perhaps the area where
the religious issue will be most ef-
ective against Kennedy. Sarasota,
St. Petersburg, and Orlando are
probably safe for Nixon. In Jack-
sonville, it will be close, with Ken-
nedy in the lead, but Barry Gold-
water has been very effective
there, but mostly on the aristoc-
racy. Both Nixon and Kennedy ap-
pear there next week. Tampa and
Miami are anybody’s guess. Again,

We are thoroughly disgusted! In

Dear Editor:

last Friday’s edition of the Ring-tum
Phi there appeared a column en-
titled “Senator Goldwater’s Con-
servatism Refuted,” which gave an
example of an uninformed, biased
person’s attempt to write about poli-
tics. What resulted was an erroneous
misrepresentation of the views of
one of the great political philoso-
phers of this generation, Senator
Barry Goldwater. We shall try only
to answer the allegations made in
the column, rather than to present
and defend Senator Goldwater’s phil-
osophy.

The first two paragraphs of the ar-
ticle brand it as an utterly ridicul-
lous distortion of political realities.
The Democratic Party, dominated
by Jack Kennedy, Hubert Humph-
rey, “Soapy” Williams, Walter Reu-
ther, and Eleanor Roosevelt, is rec-
ognized as the party of the Left, and
any attempt to make it appear mod-
erate is just the wishful thinking of
a group of die-hard Democrats who
do not realize political truths.

Though the Republican Party
certainly has its left-wing, it is
controlled by middle-of-the-road-
ers, such as President Eisenhower,
Richard Nixon, Thruston Morton,
and Walter Judd. How can the
Democratic Party be labeled mod-
erate and the Republican Party
radical?

In a democracy there is a need for
diTerences in political thinking. Only
a government formed through com-
promise can represent the general
public. The Republican Party toler-
ates divergence by seeking the help
and influence of Senator Goldwat-
er’s faction.

In direct contrast, the Democrat-
ic Party has told its conservative-
wing, the Southern Democrats, that
they are not needed for election, and
has insulted them with boos in Los
Angeles.

The columnist attacks Senator
Goldwater on the basis of person-
al appearance. Does he think that
Senator Kennedy has the mature
mien of a President of the United
States? Or doesn’t he look more
like a Harvard playboy?

We wonder whether the columnist
has even read Senator Goldwater’s
book, The Conscience of a Conser-
tive, or whether he has just read a
review of the book by The New Re-
public, one of the most radical pub-
lications in this country. Should peo-
ple avoid reading this book for fear
of being accused of “naivite (sic),
self-righteourness, chauvinism, and
plain ignorance” as purported by the
columnist?

The columnist implies that Vice-
President Nixon is influenced by all
members of his party, including Sen-
ator Goldwater. Isn’t Senator Ken-
nedy influenced by Walter Reuther,
John Galbraith, and the Americans
for Democratic Action?

The columnist suggests that all
conservatives vote Democratic this
year because “the old notion of
creeping socialism in the Demo-
cratic party has been dispelled.”
Has it been dispelled, or has it
been intensified?

A portion of the column was de-
voted to Senator Goldwater’s for-
eign policy. Although we do not
agree with all facets of the Sena-
tor’s foreign policy, we do wonder
why he is attacked for proposing a
tough policy toward international
communism. The Democratic Party
should have been tougher with the
communists during its twenty years
of fiascos in regard to Soviet Rus-
Sla.

We can respect people who dis-
agree with Senator Goldwater’s
philosophy of government; however,
people who ridicule and criticize the
Senator without any factual ref-
erences and bases do not deserve
our sympathy.

GEORGE T. COWARD

both candidates will speak in each
place next week, and that might
be the turning point.

To sum up: three weeks ago, most
people felt Nixon had a good edge
in Florida. Johnson has mended
fences and the Democratic organiza-
tion is now moving, and moving fast.
What happens in the next few weeks,
of course, will be the deciding factor,
but I might venture that the relig-
ious issue will either be forgotten or
the Democrats will play up a “If
you vote for Nixon you're a bigot”
theme. Probably the main issue,
more and more, especially in the key
area of Miami, will be foreign af-
fairs. Castro means a lot down there,
and the party which proves it can
handle him effectively might be the
winner. In the long run—and I’m just
guessing—I think Kennedy will take
Florida.

 

Webster Unabridged
Speaking Rules,
UCA Discussed

Signs of the times: one afternoon
last week, having completed my de-
gree application, I strode out of
Washington Hall into the tradition-
al October sunshine. The atmos-
phere was redolent of ivy, tweed,
,and learning.

My glance wandered over the daz-
zling columns, with their perpetual
Ipana smile; past the tastefully at-
tired trees; across the greensward’s
smoothness.

Down the slope, a beer can’s throw
from Old Cyrus, were thirty little
girl-children, playing dog-and-bone.
The game appeared entirely spon-
taneous and disorganized; the play-
ers were in a ragged circle, and
seemed unable to keep in a fixed
pattern. What’s more, gentlemen,
they were—oh, the monstrousness
of it—actually shrieking with de-
light!

Obviously these girl-children had
not been assimilated into the tra-
ditions of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity. They did not know that we
frown on frivolity.

But, come to think of it, perhaps
they picked an ideal spot to be friv-

olous in.
* * *

We understand that the UCA is
learning about “Campus Gods” again
this year. Also that the Forensic
League is debating the merits of sub-
sidized athletics.

My guess is that, after the foot-
ball team’s eye-opening successes
this fall, there’ll be very little in-
terest in exhuming the subsidiza-
tion controversy. As for campus
gods, we enjoy worshipping them too
much to do anything except point
a self-righteous finger every now
and then.

ae * *

As a few freshmen seem confused
about the speaking tradition, some
elucidation of the rules seems appro-
priate. It is necessary to speak to
someone only when:

1. He looks as if he expects you to
speak.

2. His tie is tightly knotted, and of
the proper design.

3. He passes within three feet of
you, approaching at an angle be-
tween 145 and 180 degrees. (Note:
a convenient custom is for the
freshman to mumble “Hi” just as he
passes abreast of the other person.)

* * ok

Last, and certainly least, a note
of thanks is due to the SWMSFC
(pronounced “Swumps”) for relax-
ing its entrance requirements enough
to admit an Independent Party man.
Truly the mercy of the University
Party surpasseth understanding.

 

NOTICE

There will be a meeting of the For-
ensic Union at 7:15 p.m. Thursday
in the student union. The topic will
be: “Resolved that American col-
leges should be subsidized in ath-
letics.”. Everyone interested is in-
vited to attend.

Generals Victorious Yellow Jackets, 26-3

W&L Capitalizes on Macon’s
Mistakes In Game’s Second Half

The Washington and Lee Gener-
als traveled to Ashland, Virginia,
Saturday, and gained their fourth
victory of the season with a 26-3 tri-
umph over Randolph-Macon. W&L
got off to a slow start but scored
three times in the second half against
the outgunned Yellow Jackets.

Much to the delight of the partisan
Homecoming crowd, Randolph-Ma-
con stopped the powerful W&L run-
ning attack and drew first blood
early in the second quarter on a
thirty yard field goal by Harry Hul-
vey. The Generals took the ensuing
kickoff and drove down to the Jack-
ets’ 10, where the drive stalled.

Two plays later, the alert W&L
defense recovered a fumble on the
19. This time the Blue and White
were not to be stopped and quar-
terback Steve Suttle cracked over
from the 3 for the touchdown. The
half ended with W&L holding a
precarious 6-3 lead.

The Generals’ running attack
finally got rolling in the third quar-
ter. Bob Funkhouser capped a sixty
yard scoring surge with a 2-yard
plunge. Suttle ran over for the two
extra points to give the Generals a
14-3 lead. Suttle scored the touch-
down which was set up by Dan
Blain’s bunt which rolled dead on
the Jackets’ 4.

In the waning minutes of the
game, Suttle tossed a 39-yard scor-
ing pass to halfback Jim Hickey
after a Randolph-Macon fumble.
The try for two points failed and

 

the game ended with the Generals
on top 26-3.

Once again the feared W&L de-
fense proved too much for the oppo-
sition as the Yellow Jackets were
held to a mere 73 yards on the
ground. Bob Funkhouser led the vic-
tors’ ground attack while Terry Fohs
intercepted two passes and recover-
ed a fumble to spearhead the de-
fense.

X-C Team Loses
To Lynchburg

The cross-country team of Wash-
ington and Lee suffered a 49-15 de-
feat from the runners of Lynchburg
College last Friday afternoon on the
Hornets home course.

The first six places in the meet
were taken by Lynchburg men with
Mike Brumby, Mike Shank, and
Stoney Duffey following them.

The meet, which was run dur-
ing the halftime of the soccer game
between American University and
Lynchburg, was the fourth for the
Generals and the first loss of the
season. They had previously de-
feated Prieffer, Randolph-Macon,
and Hampden-Sydney.

The next team the cross-coun-
try men will meet will be Rich-
mond on the 28th of this month.
The W&L team was originally
scheduled to participate in the
State AAU Meet but plans have
been changed. Following the Rich-
mond meet the team will run
against High Point and Catawba
in a dual meet at High Point,
North Carolina, and will close the
season with the State Meet at
Hampden-Sydney.

 

Frosh Defeated

By Staunton
In Close Game

The Freshman football team lost
to the Staunton Military Academy
team, 7-6, last Friday afternoon. The
freshman team, while making the
first score of the game, could not
keep their edge over the Staunton
team.

Throughout the game the Baby
Generals fought their opponents
off the goal line and only allowed
them one touchdown, but the ex-
tra point conversion was the de-
ciding factor.

Coach Hal Bates said the biggest
factor in the loss was the off week
which the team had between the
game with Woodberry Forest and
Staunton. Also a contributing factor
to the loss was the amount of ill-
ness which has hit the team in the
last week or so.

Bates also cited halfback Jay
Norman as being probably the
most outstanding of our team in
the game last Friday. Norman
came out late for practice, and
this was the first game he had real-
ly been able to play in.

Fohs Is Named
R-t Phi Player
Of The Week

One of the reasons for W&L’s
tromping of the Randolph-Macon
Yellow Jackets last week was the
strong line play of the team which
centers around Terry Fohs, center
and tri-captain. His performance in
last Saturday’s game and his con-
sistent defensive game earned him
this week’s player of the week.

In the Randolph-Macon game Ter-
ry, in his line backer position on the
line was one of the main reasons for
keeping the Yellow Jeckets at only
nine first downs and 73 yards rush-
ing compared to W&L’s 12 first
downs and 208 yards rushing.

Fohs, by his performance at Ash-
land, showed again why he was
named “roughest” player of the team
his freshman year and has led the
team in tackles for the last two years.
His talent comes out in the defensive

tackling field and his hard-hitting
enthusiasm on the line provides
| a spur to the rest of the team.

In recognition of his game Sat-
urday, the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch named Terry the Lineman of
the Week, an honor which we heart-
ily concur with.

Bootmen Play UNC;
J.V. Team Loses to U.Va.

The Washington and Lee soccer
team will play its fourth game of
the season this Wednesday on home
ground when it meets the Univer-
sity of North Carolina on the Alum-
ni Field at 3:15.

The bootmen’s record so far
stands at 2-1 with wins over Pfeif-
fer College and Randolph-Macon.
In their encounter last week
with Duke University they lost
3-0.

The Coaches Corner

Coach Reviews
And Previews

What a wonderful thing this mo-
notony is! Let’s hope that it keeps
up.

Again I must report the victory as
squad earned. The “blues” scored
twice, the “reds” once, and the
“golds” once. After a shakey first
half, our boys really went to work
as the fired up Yellow Jackets be-
gan to wilt in the muggy heat.

I was especially proud of the over-
all effect on defense, the work of
the “blue” line on offense, and Dan
Blain’s punting which was a big
factor in the game’s outcome.

For unsung heroes I pick Malcolm
Brownlee and Bill Wheeler. It was
the blocking of these two tackles
that enabled our halfbacks to gain
consistently on our quick opening
plays.

Why didn’t we go for the one point
rather than the two point conver-
sion? We are greedy.

This week we will meet the
strongest opponent we have played
thus far. Johns Hopkins is unde-
feated and this past week they
smothered Haverford 48-0. The Blue
Jays run mostly from a “wing-flank-
er” formation. The attack features
the passing of Henry Ciccarone and
Joe Cioni. Norman Steketee is the
principal runner from the fullback
spot.

With these two points firmly

thing like a “Hollins Gestapo,”
making unannounced or irregular

Lyles, “This will probably be the|
hardest team we will meet this year, |
excluding first-rated Maryland. We}
will have to work hard to win.” In
their lineup the North Carolinians
have an All-American Candidate
and a number of returning letter-
men.

The remaining schedule of the
team includes Lynchburg, North

Virginia, and Maryland, which is
rated the first team in the south.

The Junior Varsity squad of the
soccer team lost its first game of the
season to the University of Virginia
Freshmen, 7-1.

Coach Joe Lyles attributed the
defeat to lack of interest on the part
of the students, especially in coming
out for the sport. The squad consists
of only nine men, while a regulation
squad has eleven. Lyles said that he
was sure that there were boys in
the freshman class who had played
soecer in high school or prep school,
but they had just not come out.

ings of the association,’ the whole
operation seems to have an air of
snooping to us. We have the word of
more than one Hollins girl that these
room checks are not used just at the
beginning of the year, but might oc-
cur any time during the school year.

It is not immediately evident that
to cut such a meeting would be any
more serious than cutting a Univer-
sity Assembly, but the fact remains,
however, that the University does
not question whether or not the
white card with our name and date
on it really was filled out by the per-
son whose name is on it or not. Our
Honor System takes care of the au-
thenticity of attendance cards.

We wonder if attendance cards,
like ours, would be an acceptable
substitute for the “room check”
used by the executive council of

S.G.A. at Hollins. If so, then the |

problem is solved.

Our impression, from the story and
from subsequently talking with Hol-
lins girls about it, is that such cards
wouldn’t be an acceptable substi-
tute at Hollins.

We realize the strength or weak-

ness of the Hollins honor system is |

not an earth shaking problem for
W&L men to lose sleep over. Earth
shaking or not, doesn’t it raise a

| question or two as to the strength

of or validity of the honor system
at Hollins College in your mind? We
at least wonder about it, though not
constantly.

 

NOTICE
There will be a meeting of the Stu-
dent War Memorial Scholarship

Fund Committee tonight at 7 o’clock
in the Student Union. All new mem-
bers are requested to be present.

empires of the western nations have
shrunk. Up to this time not one of
the Communist colonies has been set
free.

It is necessary that we bring this
fact to the immediate attention of
the world’s population, both the
leaders and the masses. What bet-
ter way could we bring this fact to
the attention of the world than by
a dignified presentation of the facts
before the UN.

Why then should not a resolution

cal to believe that many students’
parents sympathize with Republi-

We must assume that students
at W&L merely reflect the views of
their parents. We realize that this
simplified explanation appears to
run away from the main question, or
rather it tends to place us full cir-
cle facing the original problem. The
faults of this explanation we cannot
discount, however, it remains the
best idea with which we were able
to satisfy the query.
