SW MSFC Hiring
Br’'dway Arranger

Steve Danzansky, producer-director of the 1961 SWMSFC

Musical, announced today the employment of Crane Calder

as arranger for the show.

Mr. Calder, a noted Broadway arranger, has worked with
Rogers and Hammerstein on such shows as ‘‘Carousel”’ and the
recent hit, ‘Flower Drum Song.” He was an associate in the

 

Jarrard Given
Research Grant
By Institute

A Washington and Lee University
psychology professor has _ been
awarded a $2,300 research grant from
the National Institutes of Health to
study the effects of irradiation on
behavior.

Dr. Leonard E. Jarrard was given
the grant for a year-long study of
the effects of X-rays on behavior
in white rats, according to an an-
nouncement by Dr. William W.
Pusey, dean of the college. Dr. Jar-
rard is an assistant professor of psy-
chology.

Some of his finding may prove
helpful in understanding how radia-
tion exposure may effect human
beings.

Application for the grant was made
in late August following a prelim-
inary summer study under the aus-
pices of a Washington and Lee grant-
in-aid from the John M. Glenn
Fund for faculty research. Dr. Jar-
rard’s summer work included con-
ferences with Dr. Ernest Furght-
gott, a member of the staff of the
Oak Ridge atomic energy laboratories
and a leader in the study of irradia-
tion effects.

To Purchase Equipment

Plans call for Dr. Jarrard’s re-
search to be conducted in the psy-
chology laboratories at Washington
and Lee. The grant will be used to
purchase additional equipment for
testing behavorial patterns of rats
after exposure to varied amounts
of radiation. He will begin detailed
work immediately.

Dr. Jarrard hopes his research
will establish “a technique that may
prove of value in subsequent radia-
tion research.” Results may also
help find an accurate measure of the
minimum amount of radiation that
will cause changes in behavior. An-
other application would be the test-
ing of various chemical agents for
offsetting harmful effects of radia-
tion.

Undergraduate at Baylor

Dr. Jarrard first became interested
in this problem when he was an
X-ray technician during undergrad-
uate years at Baylor University. He
pursued the problem in study for his
M.A. degree at Carnegie Institute of
Technology.

A member of the Washington and
Lee faculty since 1959, he received
his Ph.D. degree from Carnegie.

Recently retiring from Broadway
as a result of an illness, Mr. Calder
now resides in Lynchburg. Danzan-
sky, who is writing both lyrics and
the music for this year’s show, said
that Calder will arrange his music
for an orchestra.

The rehearsals for the musical will
be held in the old Co-op. Danzan-
sky added that the facilities are be-
ing improved in the building to in-
clude extra lighting and heat.

The musical this year will go on
the road. According to Dave Lefko-
witz, SWMSFC chairman, after the
performance here, the ’61 show will
travel to Roanoke and Lynchburg
to play for the local girls schools,
Hollins, Sweet Briar, and Randolph-
Macon, and an audience sponsered by
the local W&L alumni organizations.

Earlier this week the cast was an-
nounced for the show. Those students
include: Ron Alenstein, Pete Alford,
Bob Allen, Tom Andrew, Philip
Booth, Bart Chamberlain, Dick Cop-
lan, Ed Croft, Brian Dorsk, Cal de
Coligny, Jay Green, Walter Lee, Jay
Legum, and Bill McCollum.

Also selected were: Tim Morton,
Andy Leonard, Phil Leventhal, Wes
Ostergren, Larry Smail, Herb Solo-
mon, Firth Spiegel, Harry Teter,
John Towler, Pete Trager, John
Winegrenner, Bruce Welihan, Rob-
in Wood and Stuart Yoffee.

Danzansky added that Sweet
Briar and Randolph Macon have
been contacted about using their
girls in the show, but the decision
is pending a reading of the script by
the schools.

Last year’s show, “The Cannon’s
Mouth” also directed and produced
by Danzansky, was an outstanding
success.

 

Admissions Up 17 Per Cent

Applications for the class of 1965
are currently arriving at the admis-
sions office at a rate of 17 per cent
ahead of last year, according to Dean
Frank J. Gilliam, director of admis-
sions.

Dean Gilliam explains that the
greater number of applications indi-
cates there will be a continuing rise
in the quality of record required for
the group selected for admissions.

The increase in correspondence
this year has been so great that two
additional, part-time secretarial aides
have had to be added to the admis-
sions staff,

Last year there were 1,261 appli-
cations for the present freshman
class. Out of this total, a_ little
over 500 were accepted to fill a class
of 320.

Dance Plan Rule Changed

In conjunction with a recent Executive Committee
ruling the University Dance Board has removed the trans-
fer of dance plans from the Honor System. The board, in
a meeting Thursday evening, decided to support the
non-transfer clause on the plans, but enforcement will be

Students who appear at a dance set function will be
required to identify themselves, and those possessing an-
other’s dance plan will be turned away from the door and
the plan will be destroyed regardless of its owner.

Even though the transferability of the plans is deemed
a dance board offense, if any student gains entrance to such
a university function by lying or any other dishonest act,
he is subject to an honor system violation.

 

 

 

 

MOOS TO SPEAK HERE

Six-Time Presidential Candidate, Political Writer
To Be At International Relations Week, Feb. 7-9

Norman Thomas and Malcolm
Moos were announced today as the
featured lecturers in Washington and
Lee’s Seventh Annual International
Relations Week, to be held Feb.
7-9. A third speaker will be an-
nounced at a later date.

Norman Thomas, six-time candi-
date of the Socialist Party for the
Presidency of the United States
(1929-1948), is one of the elder
statesmen of liberal thought in the
United States. Many of the issues
for which he was regarded as a
“far-out” liberal in the 1930’s have
become part of the dominant so-
cial and political philosophy of
America—so much so that he has
complained, in jest, that the major
parties have taken large parts of
his platform away from him by en-
acting it into law.

 

Cotillion Spirit Being Revived
At 52nd W&L Fancy Dress Ball

By the Friday Staff
and
W&L Information Service

The cotillion spirit will be revived
for this year’s colorful Fancy Dress
Ball Jan. 27.

Gala costumes, traditional style
dance music, an elaborate figure and
vivid decorations will ad gusto to the
52nd annual student dance, often
hailed as the “South’s outstanding
collegiate social event of the year.”

Starting the three days of festivi-
ties will be the traditional cocktail
party on Friday from 4:30 until 6:30,
at the Mayflower Inn. The party is
being given in honor of the dance set
president, Don Partington, a Phi
Gam senior from Culpeper, Va. The
popular Brothers Four will be in
the performers’ spotlight.

The theme for the 1961 ball is

Miller Wins
Howe Award

Russell B. Miller was one of eight
area college students to receive the
James Lewis Howe award from the
Virginia Blue Ridge Section of the
American Chemical Society, last
Saturday at Hollins College.

The Howe Awards are presented
annually to the most outstanding
upperclass majors in chemistry and
chemical engineering at the colleges
in the Blue Ridge Section of the
society.

The late Dr. Howe, a world
authority on the platinum metals,
was for many years chairman of
the chemistry department of Wash-
ington and Lee University.

Besides Miller, winners in the area
include Elizabeth Ann Dodd of Hol-
lins College; Juliette Boyd O’Neil,
Sweet Briar College; Mary George
Foster Gore, Randolph-Macon Wo-
man’s College; and Larry L. Jackson
of VMI.

Miller, a member of Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity, is a junior from Houston,
Tex.

 

 

... What's this? Things must be looking up. “Shark” Payne lets go with a

James.” The Tommy Dorsey Orches-
tra under the able direction of War-
ren Covington will provide the music
for the dance. And a lavish figure
will be led by president Partington
and his vice presidents.

Between 400 and 500 persons are
expected to appear in costume for
the annual ball.

Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy, in the
costume of Shakespeare, bard of the
court, will present the outstanding
personages of his plays as they appear
before the King and Queen. The in-
cident depicted is the elevation of
Shakespeare and his players to the
position of Knights of the Chamber
Extraordinary, an event that took
place in the Court of St. James in
1603. Dr. Flournoy is a Shakespeare-
an scholar and a W&L professor of
English.

From Six Plays

Figure participants will include
characters from six of Shakespeare’s
plays. The dance set vice presidents
and their dates will depict the lead-
ing men and women in Hamlet, King
Lear, Merchant of Venice, Anthony
and Cleopatra, Henry IV, and Julius
Caesar.

The university’s John Graham
Brass Choir will play during the
presentation of the president and
the vice presidents.

The Vice Presidents

The six vice presidents are Ned
Ames, Delt senior from Accomac,
Va.; Don Rhinesmith, Phi Gam senior
from Williamsburg, Va.; George
Birdsong, SAE senior from Suffolk,
Va.; Steve Danzansky, ZBT senior
from Washington, D.C.; Hayward

Educated at Princeton

Educated at Princeton and at Un-
ionTheological Seminary, Mr. Thomas
is author of many books. Two of
his more recent ones are A Social-
ist’s Faith (1951) and The Test of
Freedom (1954). He holds an honor-
ary doctoral degree from Princeton
University.

Dr. Moos will soon resume his
duties as Professor of Political
Science at Johns Hopkins Universi-
ty, after having been on leave to
serve as Administrative Assistant to
President Eisenhower. In this capac-
ity he has served as the President’s
speech writer.

Professor Moos was educated at
the University of Minnesota and the
University of California. He has
taught in the Universities of Ala-
bama, Wyoming, and Michigan, in
addition to Johns Hopkins, where
he has been a member of the faculty
since 1942. He, too, is the author of
several books, and he is currently
working on the problems of tran-
sition between successive presidents.

Thomas’ Theme

Mr. Thomas will speak on the
subject, “An American Socialist
Views the East-West Conflict.” The
precise topic of Dr. Moos’ address
has not been fixed, but it will be
complementary with foreign policy,
especially as it is involved with the
Free World’s efforts to counter the
Sino-Soviet threat.

Professor John Gunn, Director of
International Relations Week, stated
that he is particularly pleased to
have such effective spokesmen for
two sharply contrasting points of
view. He added that Norman Thomas
has been a creative and constructive
thinker in an American liberal move-
ment that is often more dogmatic
than imaginative, and that Malcolm
Moos can be expected to give a
reasoned statement of the Adminis-
tration’s position.

Both men have spoken previously
at Washington and Lee. Norman
Thomas spoke on the campus in the
1930’s, and Professor Moos five
years ago.

A Crucial Hell Week

It is truly unfortunate that

Help Week proposals drafted

in the IFC failed to gain endorsement by that body. This would
have been an attempt to remedy a condition which we all know
is dangerous, and such positive action on the part of a student
organization would have been a likely deterrent to future inter-
vention by the administration in this area.

As it stands now, “Hell Week” this year is a powder keg. It
will be incumbent upon all fraternity officials to cooperate
with the judiciary committee of the IFC to insure that no
violation of standing regulations occurs. Even more important
than organizing personal police action, however, all fraternity
men should exercise good judgment and discretion in planning

their activities during that week,
of good taste.”

keeping in mind the “‘principles

The “positive program’ advocated, but dismissed by the
IFC should receive consideration by the pledge masters and
other individuals who plan their house’s ‘Hell Week” procedure
The “negative” report of the IFC deserves attention as well.
While brothers idealistically conceive of a unified core of frater-
nity members they should remember: ‘“‘that no pledge can in-
crease his respect for any individual or group of individuals
which forces him to perform deeds that violate his basic sense of

human dignity and decency.”

Of course, all fraternity men are mindful of the conse-
quences that might result from violations of “long-standing”
rules, but possibly we should anticipate other consequences—
unfortunately a university in the west didn’t, and as a result
tragedy ended the week of supposed pledge unification.

Ww
GOOD LUCK

Ww
ON EXAMS!

A group of former students of
Professor Clayton E. Williams found
out it’s easier to please than surprise
the retired dean of Washington and
Lee University’s School of Law.

Some 34 of them planned to do
both, but while Dean Williams was
pleased with the hand-made, auto-
matic, 20-gauge shotgun they pre-
sented him several weeks ago, he
wasn’t quite as surprised over the
gift as his friends had hoped he
would be.

“T wasn’t so sure I was going to get
a gun that I brought along a box of
shells, but I was pretty suspicious
of things,” Dean Williams laughed.

The presentation, made by Gra-
ham Morison of Washington, D.C.,
a member of the law class of 1932,
was planned to mark the end of
Dean Williams’ final year as dean.
His retirement from that office was
effective last September.

“We just didn’t want to see 1960
end without expressing our grati-
tude to Dean Williams for all he
has meant to us,” Morison said.

Because Dean Williams is an ar-
dent, expert sportsman, Morison said
he and Martin P. Burks, III, of
Roanoke, conceived the idea of a
gift for hunting or fishing.

Mrs. Williams was asked for a
suggestion, and she told them Dean
Williams had shown a recent inter-
est in an automatic shotgun. Mori-
'son immediately placed an order
' with the Remington firearms people

for one of the finest weapons they
produce.

But when some of Dean Williams’ |
Rockbridge County hunting buddies!
found out what the gift would be,
they had reservations about it.

“Skinny Williams was brought up
on an old-fashioned, double-barrel

 

shotgun,” said Cap’n Dick Smith,
former Washington and Lee athlet-
ic director. “He wouldn’t anymore

-|own one of those fancy jobs than

fly to the moon!”

Here, says Morison, was some-
thing Dean Williams had dealt with
in 41 years as a law professor—a
conflict of evidence. To resolve the
issue, Smith, D. Allen Penick, Mat-
thew W. Paxton and others or-
ganized a hunt for Dean Williams.

Around the campfire, they drew
him into a discussion on guns, and
sure enough, out of it came the ad-
mission that while he hadn’t held
much for automatic shotguns in the

-|past, Dean Williams thought per-

haps he’d reached the point in his
hunting career where an automatic
might improve his bag.

Because the special Remington
gun demanded exact specifications,
Dean Williams’ friends even finagled

-|the necessary measurements from
_| him. About this time, Dean Williams

began to wonder why all this sud-
den interest in his arm length and
his opinions on automatic shotguns.
It didn’t take his legally-trained
mind long to weigh the evidence and
arrive at a correct verdict, one he
kept to himself, though.

While Dean Williams may not
have been surprised at receiving
a gun, he was appropriately impres-
sed by the magnificence of the wea-
pon. Every part, both metal and
wood, is hand-tooled of the finest
materials. Sunk into the stock is a

silver medallion, inscribed for Dean
Williams.

“The company put one man,
working day and night, on this gun
for us,” Morison said. “He did a
wonderful job.” Morison says the
gun is valued at around $1,300.

The presentation took place in
the faculty lounge of the law school
where 18 of the 34 who gave Dean
Williams the gun were present.

“All of them wanted to be here,
but they’re spread all over the Unit-
ed States,” said Morison. “We could
have gotten hundreds to chip in on
Dean Williams’ gift if there had been
time to get in touch with all of
them.”

“To Clayton E. Williams, Dean,
School of Law, Washington and Lee
University, 1946-1960, Professor of
Law, 1919-, Gentleman and Inspir-
ing Teacher of the Law, Bird Hunt-
er and Fisherman Extraordinary.

“This especially made Remington
automatic shotgun is presented by
the undersigned, who are friends
and grateful former students, to
mark his retirement as Dean and
with the hope that such modern
weaponry will be tolerated as it in-
creases the bag.”

Dean Williams, obviously pleased
with the gesture and the new gun,
had one observation:

“I don’t know what Mrs. Williams
is going to say when she finds out
I've been involved in a_ shotgun
ceremony.”

Ep: toR

The Ring-tum Phi

Dear Sir:

Page two of the Tuesday Edition
of the Ring-tum Phi has a peculiar
consistency about it. It usually stinks!
And this past one was no exception.

 

It is somewhat ironic that two fine|_
columnists as Ed Webster and Harvey | 7
Allen have to share space with such]

trash. The basic problem is, of course,
an excess of acid-forming abuse of

the press, resulting in an upset,| \?"7

odor-producing page. Now abuse of
the press usually stems from two
things: misinterpreting and/or mis-
quoting the facts, or too liberal an
application of petty personal pre-
judice.

We can find examples of both. For
instance, we read that this is “a
time when the South is being scalped
in Congress;” and that “the South
has become the whipping boy of
the...national legislature;” and we
wonder at the naivete of such state-
ments, in view of the committee sys-
tem in Congress, and in view of the
fact that Southern Congressmen
overwhelmingly dominate these com-
mittees by virture of the seniority
system.

But what’s behind this display of
editorial inefficiency? The answer is:
provincialism—pure, unadulterated
pre-historic provincialism. The bas-
is for page two has been out and out
devotion to separateness. In speak-
ing of the Centennial Service,
through which the Tuesday Edition
got to pot-shoot at the rest of Amer-
ica, the Tuesday Editor told us,
“One of the avowed purposes of the
Centennial is to promote unity.”
And unity—that’s bad!

But, picture it: there they are in
Lee Chapel holding a service. So
what? So it gives the UDC something
to do on a Sunday afternoon. So the
school does get to exploit Robert E.
Lee’s name for some press coverage.
So what? What’s so terrible?—but
no, you'd think it was General Sher-
man staining the old Heartland again.

Centennial! Think of it; that means
one-hundred! (100!) Isn’t the war
over yet? What’s the purpose of the
whole Centennial if not to show the
futility of war? And those guys
still want to keep fighting!

And unity—that’s bad. Yes, there’s
the basis of it, a personal perdilection
for separateness. It’s a personal kind
of “prejudice” (they use the word
themselves) which is at the bottom of
it all. But what does it mean for
Washington and Lee? Well, more
than anything else, its a desire for
separateness in the student body. As
if there’s not enough already!

We've got second-class, “sectional,”
“whipping-boys”—and the Yankees

The firing of the cannon against
Fort Sumpter on the 12th of April,
1961, by a group of indomitable

venture in folk-

barring an early
surrender, should
end at Appomatox
on the 9th of
April, 1964.

The purpose of
the Centennial is
a challening one:
to promote unity
and patriotism in the hearts of all
Americans, black and white, yankee
and rebel. This desire to promote
unity is probably a sincere one, but
the Centennial is not without its
critics.

New Proposals Are Advanced
To Bring Civil War To Halt

Friday Columnist

Kennedy, “as umpire of battle re-
creations,” declare that the South
really won the war after all.

South Could Be Swapped

The editor of the Enterprise
pointed out that a secession by the
South might be profitable to both
sides. The U.S. could then swap
the South for Red China in the
U.N., where the chairman of the
House and Rules Committee might
be able to teach the Reds some-
thing about obstructionist techniques.

The new government of the South
would probably be similar to that
of the U.S., but with more emphasis
upon states rights: state control of
tariffs, foreign policy, education, etc.
Some cynics, however, have suggest-
ed that the new government might
take the form of the Senate Finance
Committee.

Who Would Be President?

Who would be the new president,
or chairman of the South (accord-
ing to your viewpoint) is a moot
question at present. Harry Byrd of
Virginia is of course a strong pos-

we enjoy to the fullest the protec-
tions that this membership gives us.
But, in exchange for this protection
and its benefits we incur obliga-
tions. Now the law of the land,

i.e., the Supreme Court, has de-
termined that there will be no
further segregation on the basis of
color, and in this decision the court
is supported by the United States
government. Therefore, let us in
the Southland get busy and try to
perfect a way to implement this
decision that will be easiest for all
concerned.

 

This is the time for us in the
United States—and especially the
young adults—to look to ourselves
and act with dignity and courage;
there should be no place in our
thoughts for those characteristic
statements of “scalped in Congress,”
“rammed down our throats,” “whip-

With all the current furor about
grades, and especially with the Wash-
ington and Lee grading system, and
also with exams
starting Monday,
I've given some

thought to my
own grades, and
consequently to

my own grading
system. I haven’t
worked out all the
details yet, but I
think I have a
more logical plan
than the one now
in existence, and
more beneficial to all concerned than
any plan which has so far been of-
fered.

In divising my scheme I have at-
tempted to discard the disadvantages
now extant and capitalize on the
advantages. First the disadvantages:

The point most often made is that
there are no official pluses and min-
uses (I do not hold this view, for I
think that there are several pluses
and a great many minuses in office).
This is a definite disadvantage, and
out of step with the times.

   

Craven

I have professors who run up to
double pluses and down to triple
minuses, but my parents are yet
to see anything but a naked, un-
embellished “C”. If we students
can receive decorated papers, is
it not the University’s duty to send
out decorated IBM sheets?

The second disadvantage of our
system most commonly complained
of is the wide range of numbers tak-
en in by the grade of C. The com-
plaint lodged is that the 82-C should
not be forced to keep company with
a 70-C, and further that it is unfair.
This seems to me to be unfounded,
and although it may be pointed out
that the 82 man is being discriminat-
ed against, consider the fact that
the 70 man is being discriminated
for! He is being allowed to associate
with those above him, and can as-
sume their same dignity. This is
positivism in action, and I’m for it.

Now the advantage of our sys-

ledge of the alphabet only through
the letter “F”. This is modern sim-
plification. Secondly, it requires no
mathematical knowledge, or ac-

Therefore I propose that a system
be adopted which incorporates the
above advantages and turns the dis-
advantages to its favor. To begin
with we keep the tradition of W&L
by using the traditional alphabet.
We improve upon the simplicity
by eliminating all letters past “C”,
and improve the general level of
learning on campus by requiring
knowledge of mathematical symbols.
(Lynwood, use the symbols for plus
and minus here in order to acquaint
the faculty and student body with

this level of learning). This brings us
to the arbitrary allocation of num-
bers to letters.

Since “A” is on top, and the up-
per-class is shrinking, let it cover
the range from 97 to 100. That
takes care of the possible three per
cent who might be in someone’s
Four Hundred. The numbers from
96 downward to 65 should take
care of the letter “B”, if a dimin-
ishing number of pluses beginning
with 15 is employed for each des-
cending number to 81. 80 shall be

Luthy’s Phone Bill Evicts Him From His Apartment;
Asks Why It’s As Cheap To Call Alaska As Hollins

By TOM LUTHY
Friday Columnist

Whoever it was that said that the
friendly townsfolk bleed the stu-
dents of all their money is crazy.
Why, just the oth-
er day I had a chat
with a representa-
tive of the local
telephone com-
pany who tried to
dispose this popu-
lar misconception
to me.

When I asked
him why the rates
to Hollins and
to Nome, Alaska,
were the same, he
was shocked. Apparently some of his
constituents had failed to report to
him that the Alaskan rates had
reached the Roanoke level. It seems
that they need the added revenue for
training operators in pronounciation
of the names of out-of-state cities
since the girls usually have trouble
with names of more than two sylla-
bles. Another interesting fact which
was brought to my attention was that
the reason why you never get an
operator to answer before twenty-
five rings is that most of these fair
public servants are enrolled in a
night school course at Sem which
deals in elementary numbers, and
they have difficulty in making it
back the board in time for the 7 p.m.
rush.

 

Luthy

I was overjoyed to learn that
the Information operator is also
employed at the Liquid Lunch
since her union contract only al-

 

ery fifteen minutes. Actually she
really needs the money, because
the company only allocates 3 per
cent of revenue for employees’
wages. Another 17 per cent goes
to a perpetual fund for building
the public image through insti-
tutional advertising over WREL
(possibly better known to us as
the “Sonar Sound of the South!).

I couldn’t figure out who got the
other 80 percent of the take, but as
the cheerful young executive drove
me back to my cave in his Contin-
ental—my phone bill last month
made me forfeit my apartment—
something made me realize that he
could have become an “Operator”
without even going to voice school.

BLOCKED!—Bridgewater’s Jim Wilson (31) blocks a shot by W&L

center John McDowell (54). But 6-6

McDOWELL TALLIES 26 POINTS

 

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Sports Editor

“Balance that’s what counts,” said
W&L basketball coach Bob McHenry
after his charges whipped Bridge-
water, 68-63, Wednesday night at
Doremus Gym.

The Generals’ victory, their fourth
against seven losses, is a good exam-
ple of what McHenry calls ‘balance.’

John McDowell, who had not
been much help on offense the past
several games, really found him-
self as he poured in 26 points.
W&L’s two leading scorers, Bip
Fauber and Brett Thackston, ad-
ded 15 and 11 points, respectively.

Fauber and McDowell, who are
one-two in team rebounding totals,
swept the boards with 23 and 18 re-
bounds.

On defense Fauber, Thackston,
Steve Rutledge, Bill Ide, and Dave
Grogan all turned in excellent per-
formances.

Continuing his appraisal of the
game, McHenry said, “Bridgewater
didn’t play nearly so good a game
as they played when they beat us,
3 57-50, at Bridgewater. But we didn’t
play a good game either. When your
opponent plays poorly, you are in-
clined to play poorly. And that’s just
what we did.”

McHenry was very pleased with
several aspects of the Generals’
performance but cautioned that
they still needed work on both of-
fense and defense.

For the first time in four games the
Generals did not commit 20 or more
fouls. Against Bridgewater, W&L
made only 11 fouls including a sea-
son low of three in the second half—

The Generals hit 26 of 70 shots

from the floor for a 37.14 shooting
percentage, their best of the year.

For the second straight game the
Generals completely dominated the
boards, grabbing 63 rebound to
the Eagle’s 35.

Defense was another bright point
for the Generals. Their man-for-
man defense was very effective the
first half, but the zone they ran part
of the second half because Fauber
and Thackston had three fouls each
was rather loose.

“We are winning these games with
our defense,” McHenry said. “We

 

 

 

Smith, Robinson, Mercereau Star As Wrestlers
Smother Gallaudet, 25-5; Tigers Here Tonight

By PETER ALFORD
Sports Writer

The Washington and Lee wrestling |

team upped its season record to 6-2
Monday with a decisive 25-5 victory
over Gallaudet.

Coach Dick Miller’s charges have
beaten New York University and
Pfieffer College while dropping
meets to the University of North
Carolina and Franklin and Marshall.

Their next outing will be against
Hampden-Sydney tonight. A
freshman meet with Fishburne
Military Academy will start off
the evening of wrestling at 7:00.

Captain Sandy Mercereau and
Hoke Robinson led the Generals to
their win over Gallaudet. Mercereau
flattened Bill Zenor at 1:23 of the
second period while Robinson, a
freshman, pinned his man after 1:30
of the second period.

Herb Smith, another freshman,
wrestling in the 167-pound slot, won
by the largest point margin of the
afternoon as he beat Gallaudet’s
John Merlowity, 8-3. Smith has
wrestled in every meet this season
and has an impressive 4-1 record.

Last year’s 123-pound man, Dave
Montgomery, now grappling at 130,
won a decision. Montgomery, a Delt
sophomore, beat Robert Seromth,
3-1, to boost his year’s mark to 4-1.
Jud Babcock, also a sophomore, ad-
ded three points to the W&L tally
by beating Tim Adams, 4-2.

In the unlimited match, W&L’s
Bob Carlson met Al Johnson and
was pinned. Carlson succumbed
to his stronger opponent at 1:33
of the second period.

Hustling Fauber

Sparks Team
On, Off Court

At the opening of the basketball
season Coach Bob McHenry said
that W&L’s chances would depend
largely on the hustle and accurate
shooting of Bip Fauber and Ken
Kowalski.

After 11 games, the Generals own
a 4-7 record and a large chunk of
the credit for those four victories
belongs to Fauber.

Kowalski has not had a_ good
chance to live up to the coach’s pre-
diction because he has missed the
last three games with an ankle in-
jury.

But 6-2 Fauber has been the
General's leader both on and off
the court. His mates showed their
confidence in him by electing him
the permanent captain just before
Christmas.

Last year as a freshman Fauber
mede 48.2 per cent of his shots from
the floor but managed only an eight-
point scoring average.

So far this season the sophomore
hustler is still averaging 43 per
cent of his shots from the floor, and
has boosted his average to 11.5.

McHenry has nothing but praise
for Fauber, “Give me five players
that hustle and try all the time
like Fauber does and I'd be the
happiest coach in the country. Bip
is always hustling, he never quits.”

Although he is averaging 11.5 points
per game, scoring has not been Fau-
ber’s strong point. His main strength
has been rebounding.

Fauber’s season high in rebound-
ing was 24 against Emory and Hen-
ry, which had three men over 6-5
on the court at all times.

Bip, who is a fierce competitor
on the board, collected 23 rebounds
against Bridgewater; 20 against
Sewanee, another tall team; 16
against Hampden-Sydney; 12 against
Chattanooga, the best rebounding
team the Generals have faced; and
12 against Norfolk William and

Brownlee Explains His Position;
Last Column Was Misinterpreted

By MALCOLM BROWNLEE
Friday Columnist

I do not want to drag out dying
issues especially if they have already
been drug about so much that they
are worn out. But
I believe that
some clarification
is needed so that
the students who
read this column
can enter exams
without having on
their minds the
weight of what
they should do
— about the dance-
Brownlee plan issue. My po-

sition in the con-
troversy about the issue has been
misunderstood by some students.

The trouble, at least as it con-
cerns me, all started when I wrote
in this column comparing my honor
to a small rubber band. Many stu-
dents, including a good many in-

semi-formal, that is, suits for men
and appropriate dress for the ladies.

Jimmy Vann, president of the
Dance Board, expressed the hope that
the Fancy Dress weekend will be as
successful as the others of the past
have been.

Vann said, “Let me take this op-
portunity to say that no alcoholic
beverage may be brought to or con-
sumed at any of the dance functions
over the weekend. The Dance Board
hopes that the student body will sup-
port Don Partington in making this
weekend the success it has been in
the past.”

 

Homestead Cuts Rates

The Homestead is announcing
special ski rates for college students
at the Hotel’s ski and ice skating
area in Hot Springs, Va.

Beginning this weekend (Jan. 14-
15), the special rate for college stu-
dents will be $6 per day (Sat. or
Sun.) or $10 if they wish to pur-
chase a two-day weekend ticket.

The person must identify himself,
with his student I.D. card, as a col-
lege student in order to obtain this
special rate.

telligent ones, did not realize that
the column was a satire. They took
me at my word; and the really in-
telligent ones, of course, disagreed
with me.

This makes one believe that my
satire was not a clear one and there-
fore not a good one, although at the
time I wrote it, I was very pleased
with it.

I think the metaphor I used was

a good one, so good that it could
not be made ridiculous. I compared
my honor to a small rubber band
and emphasized the fact that it was
small and could not be stretched
very far. I also said that it was
most comfortable when not
stretched at all, although it was
somewhat flabby and useless then.

The idea that I would admit my
honor was small and flabby seemed
ridiculous to me. But to many stu-
dents the metaphor seemed to de-
scribe accurately the position of stu-
dents who did not want the honor
system stretched. In short, the col-
umn was not ridiculous enough or
pointed enough for good satire.

Also, it should be pointed out that
I was writing about honor, not about
the honor system. I believe that a
student’s honor should be strong
enough to keep him from breaking
an agreement he has signed whether
he is in danger of being penalized
or not. It is possible to stretch the
honor system too far, but only if
our sense of honor is limited. When
the honor system encompasses more
than the student's honor itself, then
the system has been stretched too
far.

I believe, though, that no student
wants to think of his sense of honor
as small and limited. I would like
to see students think more about
whether they are violating their
sense of honor when they break
a signed agreement and less about
whether they are violating a rule
in the honor system.

Wrestlers Meet
Tigers Tonight

ence last year, 2-0. Albert missed
the meet because of an injury but
Coach Miller said that Albert will
be ready to go against Hampden-
Sydney tonight.

Miller feels this year’s squad has
extremely good depth and balance
which will show up as the season
progresses.

“We can switch Ted Hardin,
Chick Owens, and Alex Alexander
at our lower weights and Albert,
Smith, and Sandy (Mercereau)
can wrestle anywhere from 147-
167,” Miller said. “Pagano and
Babcock at 177 gives us latitude
when someone gets hurt or sick.”

Miller thinks his three unlimited
men Sam Block, Carlson, and Gra-
ham Fulton give him more depth in
that position than he has ever had
in his nine years of coaching here.

The coach sees West Virginia as
the toughest meet this season. The
team will travel to Morgantown in
mid-February.

“Right now,” Miller said, “the
team and I are looking only at
Hampden-Sydney tonight.”

has pointeed out the Kowalski will
have to fight to regain his old place
in the lineup.

Bridgewater battled hard before
losing Wednesday, They grabbed the
lead three times and tied the score on
two other occasions.

The Generals jumped into an
early 10-5 lead, but Bridgewater
cut the margin to one point with
ten minutes left in the first half.

McDowell, Ide, and Rutledge then
combined to put the Generals ahead
by seven, 20-13, with three quick
baskets.

But Bridgewater stormed back
again. Hot-shot Jim Reedy tallied
four straight points to put it in
front, 22-21, with six minutes re-
maining.

Rutledge then sank a 20-foot
jump shot from the head of the
circle to send W&L back into the
lead.

With McDowell, who was demon-
strating how a big man should play
in the middle, leading the way, the
Generals built up a 34-28 halftime
lead.

Fauber and McDowell paced a
General rally which opened a low-
point gap early in the second half.

But Bridgewater, sparked by
Reedy and Dick Kinkaid, slowly
whittled the W&L lead until it
sprung ahead, 59-58, with four min-
utes left to play.

Ide sank a layup to put W&L
back ahead.

Then Kinkaid tossed in a basket
from the corner to give the Eagles
their last lead of the night, 61-60.

keeps.

sibility, although a let’s-go-abroad-
and-draft-Goldwater movement is
not an impossibility. The traditional
lunatic fringe in the South, a small
but militant group, would probably
demand that the Southern Nominat-
ing Convention pick an extremist
such as Leroy Collins or Estes Ke-
fauver, but this minority would
probably be met by boos and jeers.

Students of the secessionist theory
point out that Gov. Ernest Vandiver,
if he survives Georgia’s current
school crisis, is a strong choice for
Secretary of the Army or a lesser
choice for Ambassador to Nigeria.
Gov. Faubus will be a shoo-in for
the position of Secretary of Health,
Education, and Welfare.

Upton’s Sinclair’s The Jungle has
been selling well in the South this
year, and public reaction is demand-
ing a new cabinet position, a secre-
tary of Pure Food. Both Herman
Talmadge and Harry Byrd have been
mentioned for this post if the posi-
tion is created.

The secessionist policy of the En-
terprise is only one solution which
has been offered to end the Civil

is usually a truce, but then someone
like Robert Benchley writes, “If
Sandy Pendleton Had Been Drinking
At Appomatox,” and the whole thing
starts all over again.

 

University Obligated

To Decorate IBM Cards
(Continued from page 2)

65 shall be given an increasing
number of minuses up to 15. Any
grade below 65 will be an un-
adorned C, the sterility of the bare
letter symbolizing the lack of in-
tellectual activity on the part of
the recipient, but still keeping
him in good with the industries
that like the simple things in life.

This system, I believe, will succeed
in raising the level of scholarship,
bring increased prestige to our hal-
lowed halls, give the IBM machine
some fresh food for thought, and
provide some great copy for con-
founding freshmen when the new
catalogs are published and Fresh-
man Camp speeches are written.

For these reasons I ask for the
consideration of those in charge and
for the endorsement of the Tuesday
edition.

are plotting to overthrow the E.C.
O yes, “the South is on the defensive
and the agressive forces are in per-
suit.” “Persuit” indeed! Can’t even
spell. Maybe a little “persuit” is
order for the Tuesday edition, spur-
red by the “agressive forces,” (mean-
ing the rest of the world) back to
Journalism 101 for some principles in
newspaper ethics and plain common
sense—and maybe some help in spel-
ling, too.

Editorial In 19th Century
(Continued from page 2)

Although personally I am a be-
liever in integration, it is not the pur-
pose of this article to demand that
all segregation cease immediately
and the federal troops be called out
tomorrow. But, it is my purpose
to urge every student here at Wash-
ington and Lee to clear his mind
of this paralyzing sentimentality and
self-pity and make an honest effort
to face the problem fairly and with-
out personal prejudice.

“IT’S HERE-IF YOU WANT TO WORK FOR IT”

Even before Ron Spetrino received his engi-
neering degree from Case he had good job offers
from six companies.

He joined The Ohio Bell Telephone Company
—his reason: “I was convinced an engineer could
go further here—if he was willing to work for it.”

As soon as Ron got his feet on the ground
in telephone engineering, he was tapped for a

tough assignment.

The job—to engineer switch-

ing equipment modifications needed to prepare
Cleveland for nationwide customer dialing of long

distance calls.

Ron wrapped it up in five months, and found
he had earned a shot at another tough assignment.
In this job Ron helped engineer a completely new
long distance switching center for Cleveland. This
switching center connected Cleveland with the

nationwide customer dialing network.

It was

about a year later that Ron put the finishing

 

gent, positive and imaginative men we
can possibly find.”

FREDERICK R. KAPPEL, President

American Telephone & Telegraph Co,

touches on the specs for this $1,600,000 project.
Today, as a Supervising Engineer, Ron heads

a staff of five engineers and

is responsible for

telephone switching in much of the greater

Cleveland area.

He supervises the design and purchase of $3
million worth of equipment a year. And even
more important, he is charged with developing
the technical and managerial skills of his staff.

Ron knows what he’s talking about when he
says, “In this business you have to do more than
a good job. We expect a man to be a self-developer.
We expect him to take responsibility from his
first day on the job and think for himself. You
don’t get ahead around here by just doing time.”

If you want a job in which
chance to prove yourself, and

you're given every
real responsibility

right from the start—you’ll want to see your Place-
ment Office for further information.

management jobs the most vital, intelli-
