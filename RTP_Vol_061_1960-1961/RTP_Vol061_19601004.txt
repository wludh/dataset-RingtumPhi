Classicist Dr. Hadas
To Conduct Seminar

The first program in the 1960-61 series of literary seminars
will feature Dr. Moses Hadas, Jay Professor of Greek at Co-
lumbia University. Dr. Hadas plans to present his lecture on
Monday, Oct. 31, at 8:15 in duPont Auditorium.

Dr. Ross Borden, head of the W&L English department,

which sponsors these annual visits*

from outstanding men and women in
the field of English, has released the
topic of Dr. Hadas’ message as, “Hu-
manism, the Ancient Ideal and Its
Survival.” Dr, Borden added that the
appearance of Dr. Hadas on the
W&L campus marked the 35th sem-
inar sponsored by the English de-
partment. He urged all interested
persons to come by the English of-
fices in Payne Hall and obtain their
free tickets as soon as possible. The
small seating capacity of duPont
auditorium leaves only a_ limited
number of tickets available.

Dr. Hadas is known in educa-
tional circles as one of America’s
foremost professors of Greek. He
received his A.B. degree from
Emory University in 1922, his M.A.
from Columbia in 1925, his Ph.D.,
and D. Litt. from Emory Univer-
sity in 1956, and only two years
ago earned his L.H.D. from Den-
yon College.

He has served successively as in-
structor, assistant professor, associate
professor, professor, and Jay Profes-
sor of Greek at the University of
Cincinnati. Dr. Hadas is a member
of the American Philological Associa-
tion and of Phi Beta Kappa.

The latest of Dr. Hadas’ publica-
tions include Three Greek Romances,
The Homeric Gods, Basic Words of
Cicero, and The Greek Poets. His
latest translations of Greek manu-
scripts have been published as Cons-
tatine the Great and Goethe the
Poet. His most popular historical
writings are A History of Greek Lit-
erature, A History of Latin Litera-
ture, and Aristeas to Philocrates.

Dr. Borden announced that Dr.
Hadas is currently touring the coun-
try through the national program
of visiting scholars. He added that
the English department has planned
three more interesting and informa-
tive seminars this year featuring top
scholars and lecturers.

Young Republicans Meet
For Second Time Tonight

The second organizational meeting
of the “Youths for Nixon and Lodge”
will be held tonight at 7:00 in the
Student Union Building. All stu-
dents are invited to attend.

This last Saturday, the club par-
ticipated in the College State Con-
vention of the Virginia Federation
ef Young Republicans Clubs at
the University of Virginia. Hard
work by the delegation, aided by
the prestige W&L still retained
from its power in the organization
several years ago, W&L made an
impressive showing. Brent Wells,
Beta sophomore, was elected sec-
retary for 1960-61. Craig Distel-
horst was on the committee which
nominated Brent; and Dave Cook,
president of the W&L club, and a
Roanoke College delegate made
the seconding speeches.

The other officers were elected
from the schools of Roanoke College,
William and Mary and the Univer-
sity of Virginia. There are twenty-
three clubs in the Young Repub-
licans organization in Virginia.

All students of Washington and
Lee University are strongly urged
to register for the Nov. 8 election
in their respective states. The regis-
tration for absentee balloting has
already closed in some states and
the registration rolls in the other
states will be closing very soon.

 

E. C. Elections

Elections for the executive com-
mitteemen of the freshman aca-
demic and law classes will be held
Monday, Oct. 10, at 7 p.m. The
freshman academic election will
be held in Lee Chapel. The law
election will be in Tucker Hall.

Perkins To Talk
On Our Idea
Of War, Peace

By BOB BRIDEWELL

Dr. Dexter Perkins, known in edu-
cational circles as the “Dean of
American diplomatic historians,” will
speak in duPont auditorium on Tues-
day, Oct. 11, at 8 p.m. The text of
his message will deal with “Ameri-
can Attitudes Toward Peace and
War.”

Dr. Perkins comes to the Wash-
ington and Lee campus billed as
the outstanding living authority on
the Monroe Doctrine, in addition
to numerous works on American
foreign policy and on the state
of America during and after the
world wars. His latest publications
include The American Way and
The History of the Monroe Dic-
trine.

Before becoming Professor of
American Civilization at Cornell in
1954, Dr. Perkins had taught at Har-
vard, Cambridge, and the Univer-
sity of Rochester. He was Prof. of
American History and Institutions at
Cambridge from 1945-1946, Prof. and
Chairman of the Department of His-
tory at the University of Rochester
from 19251-54, and Chairman of the
Harvard Foundation for Advanced
Study and Research from 1951-1956.

Dr. Perkins holds degrees from
Harvard, Cambridge and Union
College. He was President of the
Salzburg Seminar in American
Studies until 1954, and President of
the American Historical Society
until 1956.

After serving in the infantry as a
Captain, Dr. Perkins worked on the
Peace Conference ending World War
I.

W&L History professor, Dr. Oliver
Crenshaw mentioned that the history
department was very proud to have

Dr. Perkins as a guest lecturer. “We.

want to cordially invite all history
students as well as other students,
faculty members, and townsfolk to
hear this remarkable diplomatic his-
torian.”

 

NOTICE

Tommy Edwards, sophomore
class president, has announced that
there will be a class party at the
Robert E. Lee Hotel after the
Homecomings game Saturday.

All sophomores and their dates

UCA Begins Year’s Work

The University Christian Associa-
tion met recently to welcome pros-
pective members and to organize
for the new academic year.

President Maleolm Brownlee call-
ed the meeting to order and gave
the opening prayer. He made re-
marks about the purpose of the or-
ganization: “To realize a full and
creative life” through the work of
the U.C.A.

Following Brownlee’s talk, the
chairmen of the working commit-
tees were introduced, and each gave
a brief talk on the nature of his
committee: Boys’ Club Committee
Chairman, Jerry Gray; Religious
Emphasis Week Committee Chair-
man, Bill Mosely who spoke for the
absent George Birdsong; Worship
Committee Chairman, Mac McKay;
Community Service Committee
Chairman, Pete Agelasto; and sub-
committee Mountain Missions Chair-
man, Clinton Anderson. The yet un-
official Fresiman Work Committee
was represented by Malcolm Brown-
lee and Ashley Wiltshire.

Following the meeting the commit-
tees met separately with interested
students.

 

Ray Eberle

 

Concert Guild

To Open Season

With Symphony

The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra,
Henry Sopkin, Conductor will play
here Nov. 19 at 8:15 p.m. in Doremus
Gym under the auspices of the
Washington and Lee Concert Guild.

An unusual and varied program
has been selected for the concert.
The selections to be played by the
orchestra include: Brahms—Sym-
phony No. 2; Ravel—Mother Goose
Suite; Bach—Brandenburg Concer-
to No. 3.

Also included on the program
is an original composition by Rob-
ert Stewart, Associate Professor
of Music and Fine Arts at W&L,
entitled Prelude for Strings.

The Atlanta Symphony is only
fifteen years old, having been found-
ed in 1945 as the Atlanta Youth
Symphony. Its first conductor was
Henry Sopkin, who has remained
since that time to guide the phenom-
enal growth of the orchestra. Prior to
coming to Atlanta Sopkin was wide-
ly known for his work with student
orchestras and by the many musical
works he has edited and arranged.
He still pursues these activities, but
the inereasing demands of his own
Atlanta Symphony have greatly
limited his participation in the na-
tional orchestral clinics and compe-
' titions. Nevertheless, he attends sev-
eral festivals each year during the
winter season, and spends his sum-
mers teaching orchestral methods at
orchestral methods at Northwestern
; University in Evanston, Ill.
| Those people who did not pur-
chase season tickets for the Concert
Guild series will be able to obtain
them at the door.

 

Ray Eberle To Perform for
Openings Dance Weekend

By GEORGE PREGGIN

Ray Eberle, who for six years was
the featured vocalist with the Glenn
Miller organization, will make his sec-
ond appearance at Washington and Lee
when he plays for the opening night
of Openings Dance Set, on Friday,
October 28.

Eberle also will be featured for the
dance on Saturday night. He played
here last Openings and was so popu-

* Jar with the dance goers that Dance

Board President, Jimmy Vann, has
signed him for a second appearance.

Eberle, who was with Glenn Miller
during the late ’30’s and early °40’s
will bring to W&L a band which em-
bodies basically the Miller style of
music.

Last year he featured such Glenn
Miller standards as “Elmers Tune,”
“One O’Clock Jump,” “My Reverie,”

“Chattanooga Choo Choo,” “Stairway
to the Stars,” and “My Blue Heaven.”

His most successful personal ef-
fort came in the early ’40’s when he
teamed with Helen O’Connell for a
best-selling version of “Green Eyes.”

Among his movie appearances have
been “Sun Valley Serenade,” and “Or-
chestra Wives,” both 20th Century
Fox films featuring the Glenn Miller
band.

The many showcases where Eber-
le’s name and fame spread were:
Paramount Theatre, New York; Pal-
ladium in Hollywood; Oriental and
Chicago Theatres; Slater Hotel in
New York and many other top loca-
tions where famous band players
appear.

A revival of the Glenn Miller en-
semble was made featuring other
Miller singers, Marian Hutton, Tex

 

University
Receives Gift
For 4th Year

A gift of $1,000 to Washington and
Lee University from the Equitable
Life Assurance Society of the United
States has been announced by uni-
sity President Fred C. Cole.

Equitable’s president James F
Oates, Jr., informed President Cole
that Washington and Lee is one of
125 privately-supported colleges and
universities sharing in $125,000 in
unrestricted grants for 1960.

The gift marks the fourth consecu-
tive year Washington and Lee has
been selected by the New York firm’s
Board of Directors as a participant
in its “Plan for the Support of High-
Education.”

“Washington and Lee is grateful
indeed for this support,” said Presi-
dent Cole. “Assistance such as this
is a source of constant inspiration
and encouragement to private col-
leges and universities. Mr. Oates
called attention in his letter to the
significant fact that business has
been generally becoming increasing-
ly dependent upon institutions of
higher learning for the training and
development of future managers and
executives.”

Washington and Lee continues to
| receive increasing financial support
from business and industry.

 

 

Features Science

By JOHN KIRKLEY

There is now showing a two part
poster exhibit in the display room of
duPont Hall. The first and smaller
of the two sections contains six pos-
ters presenting different aspects of
geophysical research. The other sec-
tion is composed of propaganda pos-
ters of various countries and times.

The series of propaganda posters
comes from the private collection of
Mr. Riegel, the head of the Journal-
ism Department. The posters in this
collection have been used to direct
or influence public opinion. There
are representative posters from
World War I, the rise of Hitler and
the National Socialists, the Spanish
Civil War, World War II, post-war
Hungary, and several pro and anti
Communist posters.

One large poster in fire engine red
is entitled “Deutschland erwacht!”
or “Germany awake!” This particu-
lar poster was put up all over
Berlin before the second World War.
It was drawn by the German propa-
ganda master Mjolnir.

There is a poster on “The Advant-
ages of the Smutty Story.” There is
another American poster in which a
German hand is seen stabbing a
Bible with a dagger; the caption is
“This is the enemy.” A poster by
Ellsworth Young illustrates the so-
called “rape of Belgium.” Another
shows an angry Liberty demanding
that the public buy liberty bonds.

Two posters by Thomas Benton,
“Again” and “The Sowers,” illustrate
the appeal to emotion and the instant
impact intrinsic in most good propa-

ganda. On the lighter side, there is
a poster by Howard Chandler Christi
depicting a sweet and rather attrac-
tive young lady smirking, “Gee!! I
wish I were a MAN. Id join the
NAVY.”

Mr. Riegel has been collecting
these posters since his high school
days; however, he began hunting
for posters intensively in the 1930's
and has accumulated more on each
successive trip abroad. He now has
several hundred of these posters,
which he uses in his course on
Psychological Warfare and Propa-
ganda.

The six science posters are illus-
trative material for a small pam-
phlet—“Planet Earth’—put out by
the National Academy of Sciences.
The series is designed primarily as
a high school exhibit to convey an
impresison of the type of scientific
research done in several fields of
science today. Another purpose is
to dramatize certain scientific ad-
vances to the lay observer. Since
this, in the words of Dr. Spencer, is
“an area in which the country needs
qualified scientists to do pure he-
search,” perhaps the exhibit will
have the effect of encouraging sev-
eral students to enter this field.

These large and very colorful
pesters are on the following six
topics: Earth, Oceans, Sun, and
Earth, Poles, Weather and Climate,
and Space. Each includes a quota-
tion from one of the poets of the
Bible. The exhibit should hang for
one or two weeks.

 

 

Faculty Approves Six
For Rhodes Application

The faculty has approved the nom-
ination of six men for 1960-61 Rhodes
Scholarships. The action was taken
after the committee on Graduate
Fellowships submitted the names to
the faculty.

The six men, chosen on _ the
basis of academic, as well as extra-
curricular activity included Hen-
ry Harrell, Roy Carpenter, George
Palmer Pardington, James Vann,
Kent Frazier, and Nathan Simp-
son. Their names will now be sub-
mitted to the Rhodes Scholarship
committees in their home states or
in the states to which they are ap-
plying.

Henry Harrell is a Sigma Chi from
Sabot, Va. His major is in the Eng-
lish department, and he desires to
read law at Oxford University in
England. Harrell is vice-president of
the Student Body, a member of ODK,
Phi Eta Sigma, and is on the Honor
Roll and the Dean’s List. In addi-
tion, he is a member of SWMSFC
and the Executive Committee.

Roy Carpenter is a senior from
Bryan, Texas. Carpenter is on the
Honor Roll, Dean’s List, and is a
member of Phi Eta Sigma. He was
vice-president of his sophomore
class, a member of the Dance Board,
a dormitory counselor, and a member
of the varsity baseball team. Carpen-

Pep Rally, Frosh Parade

Open Homecomings Fri.

The pep rally approved by the
IFC last week was given added im-
petus last night by a pep talk to that
body by the head cheerleader, Steve
Danzansky. Danzansky cited the im-
portance of cooperation among up-
per-classmen and fraternities in
order to make the rally a success.
“Remember how disappointed we
were as freshmen,” Danzansky said,
“when we discovered how low the
morale was among the upper-class-
men. Well, we have no excuse for
apathy now. We've got a winning
team and a freshman class that’s
anxious to support their Alma Mater.
Let’s not let them down.” Danzan-
sky called upon the whole school
to lend support Friday night and
Saturday.

The pep rally will precede the
usual freshman torch-light parade.
All fraternities were asked to hold
off their combos Friday night un-
til the completion of the rally and
parade. At the rally Coach Mac,
the team, and the candidates for
Homecoming Queen will be introd-
duced. Dr. Cole, the Alumni, and
various members of the faculty
and administration will be present.
The rally will touch off the parade
which will be organized along new
lines this year. Two automobiles
per fraternity will be allowed in
the parade and part of the judg-
ing for the annual Spirit Award
will be based on the decoration of
these automobiles.

Monday night four faculty mem-
bers, Dr. Shillington, Dr. Welch, Dr.
Borden, and Dr. Hamer, all bach-
elors, selected the girl who will be
our homecoming Queen. She will be
crowned during half-time ceremon-
ies on Saturday.

Three bands will be featured dur-
ing the game, the Halifax and the

Franklin and Marshall marching
bands and the W&L Pep Band.
W&L’'s Pep Band will also play

for the pep rally and parade.

We Need Room

NO MORE THAN THREE (3) MEMBERS OF THE
RING-TUM PHI STAFF ARE ALLOWED IN THE
PRINT SHOP AT ONE TIME.

The above ultimatum has been hanging over the work desk
of the print shop for these many years. The editors of the paper
have done their best to comply with this most necessary rule.
They have tried to keep down the crowd in the shop. Because
of circumstances beyond their control, they are not always able
to reduce their print shop staffs to three men.

Most of the work that is done on the paper has to be done
in the 24 hours before the paper goes to press. There are stories
to be written and rewritten. There are articles to be proofed.
There is “copy” to be proofed.
ten. There are jobs too numerous to mention that must be done

in the print shop.

There are times when some of these mechanics of putting
out a good newspaper must be neglected because of a shortage
of personnel and space in the already cluttered print shop. The
only answer to the problem as it stands now is to bring in more
men. These extra staff members are constantly in the hair of the
regular print shop workers who, by the way, have been quite
tolerant of the student help in the past. These men can stand
only so much. They have numerous other school publications to
put out, and there are times when the steady flow of students
in and out of the shop is almost too much of a strain for them.

The Editorial Staff of the Ring-tum Phi is in desperate need
of a room located somewhere in the vicinity of the print shop
where it would be able to carry on much of the necessary work
involved in publishing a school newspaper.

The extra room would be used for the necessary organi-
zational meetings of reporters and staff. It could serve as a
record room for past issues of the school paper and as a much
needed “‘cut library” which the publications board has been
threatening to form for the past few years. The room would
allow typists and reporters to work in relative comfort. The size
and efficiency of the various staffs would be increased. The
quality of the paper would be increased.

We need room to work. The men in the print shop need
room to work. The only answer is to find a room somewhere
on campus and to procure the permission of the University to

use it!

There are “heads” to be writ-

 

Dating, Drinking, and Dances
Recollected From W&L Twenties

By HARVEY ALLEN

Remembering some of the things we
all hear from time to time about “the
good old days,” we talked with sev-
eral persons, seeking to uncover what
was different, better, or worse about
how it used to be at W&L.

We found that the students of the
twenties were generally under less
pressure than now, particularly since
they had no threat of war hanging over
their heads. “Blue Skies” was one of
the popular tunes of the day, as played
by Jan Garber, and well described the
way the students of W&L felt about
their world then.

The mid-thirties brought changes.
Students lived “in the shadow of Hit-
ler,” as Dr. Jenks described it. The
W&L man knew that one day soon he
would have to fight, but just how soon,
nobody knew.

Contrast this with the feeling that
Dr. Crenshaw speaks of. In the late
twenties the First World War had
been over for some time and no one
thought there would ever be another
war.

Depression and hard times brought
the most direct changes to students
on the hill. They became generally
more serious and “conscious of pen-
nies,” as Dr. Moger put it, not just dol-
lars.

More emphasis was placed on dress-
ing, “looking sharp,” as we’d say, dur-
ing the late twenties. The Thomas Ltd.
of that day was Graham & Father,
located then on Main Street.

Social life we found to be much dif-
ferent. This was especially true of the
late twenties and early thirties, when
to suggest a combo at the same time
a University dance was going on was
unheard of. Students just didn’t think
about doing it.

University dance sets were attended
in great numbers, not only by Minks,
but also by VMI Keydets. Dr. Jenks
told us one reason why a W&L
man looked forward to becoming a
senior was that it meant that he could
attend the evening dances at VMI.

Afternoon dances and activities were
open to all Minks and Keydets, wheth-
er freshmen or upper classmen, but
the nightly mixing was reserved for
seniors only.

You'll probably be surprised, as we
were, to hear that any girl who found
that she had spent the entire time at
a dance dancing with only her date
was considered a wallflower!

“Cutting-in” and “tagging” were
very much the thing to do. Everyone
got around and danced with as many
different people as they could, and by

 

no means danced with their date all
night.

Not until the mid-twenties was the
road between Lexington and Hollins
paved, which made "Macon by far
the more accessible. When girls came
over for weekends, it was most usual-
ly by train.

The thirties changed this, with im-
provements in roads. The usual ar-
rangement was for girls from one
school to hire large taxies and come
that way, much in the same way that
VMI keydets get themselves to South-
ern Sem today.

Few people on campus had cars in
the twenties, mainly because the roads
were not good enough to make having
a car really worthwhile.

House parties differed in that the
usual rule for entertainment was rec-
ords, not a combo. When a combo did
play, it was made up of W&L stu-
dents, not a colored combo; an ac-
cepted thing in our time.

On the drinking angle, “a girl never
took a drink,” Dr. Jenks noted. Or-
dinarily, the only girls you would
likely see partaking would be those
from eastern schools, like Finch in
New York City.

It appears that pledging and fra-
ternity things, in general, were more
serious. Hell Week was “pretty rough”
then, even to the point that the ad-
ministration stepped in, with the re-
sult that initiations and pledge training
were milder, for a time. After World
War II, though, it got rough again.

Freshmen were more compelled by
necessity to join a fraternity. The only
place to eat, other than around town,
was the Beanery, which was located,
for a time, on the site of and in the
same building as what is now called
the “old Co-op.”

Students could sign up for meals,
on a monthly basis. The wrestling
coach ran the Beanery, and the stu-
dents on athletic scholarships served
as waiters, as part of their scholar-
ships.

That’s what the “good old days” on
the Hill were like.

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

Raven Rants

Man on the W. and L. Campus Discovers
What Should “Naturally Be Done in Fall”

By GERRY OUELLETTE
and WYNN KINTZ

We wish to consider October, for
us the best and worst of months,
and the changes which follow in its
wake.

Officially, the Germans bring in
the new season (or are they putting
out the old one) with the renowned
October Fest. That is not to say
that Washington and Lee necessarily
takes a back seat to festivities. The
first week-end in the month normal-
ly sets the pace for the rest of the
long, cold season ahead. We are
pleased to report that this year’s
first October week-end did not dis-
appoint us.

Then there is the change in the
clothing the W&L students exhibit
at this time of year. Off with the
white bucks, ye freshmen, ’tis the
season for olive drabs and shades of
charcoal. Upon investigation, we
found that the local shops (two)
have a satisfactory line of “what the
W&L gentleman should wear this
year.”

We also find that October rushes in
what we shall call, for want of a
better expression, the testing period.
Officially, mid-semester follows very
closely to the month “under re-
view,” and consequently, the profes-
sors will soon be trying their wits,
correcting student papers. Hour
quizzes, we know, are necessary evils
quite similar to the student having
to buy new books every year. The
necessity of the quizzes does not
preclude, however, the general ner-
vous feeling all students have for
them. At times, one feels that ex-
aminations are more a test of the
student’s health, mainly his nerves,
rather than a proof of his mental
materials.

The campus itself is not exempt

 

from October rejuvenation. Soo, we
shall all witness the harvest again.
Every year this seems to us one
of the most fascinating aspects of
our early morning jaunt “up the
hill.” It is more than exhuberating
to see the maintenance crew hard
at work gathering the falling leaves.
The fact which never ceases to amaze
us, not to mention the challenge
which it inevitably invites, is that
anyone could feel so energetic at
that early hour of the morning.

Generally, the attendance at the

Democrats Push

Panic Button

As GOP Threatens Solid South

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

This year’s presidential election is
unusual in many respects: the rela-
tive youth of both candidates, the
television debates, and the rise of the
Republican Party in the South. It
is this last which is most interest-
ing. It should not have been totally
unexpected; Virginia, North Carolina
and Texas have all sent Republican
representatives to congress, and the
border states of Kentucky and Mary-
land have elected Republicans to
state offices and sent them to the
Senate. Many southern states went
for Eisenhower. But this year, in
the solidest states of the Solid South,
we find Republican parties organiz-
ed on the local level, with respect-
able men doing the organizing.
(Formerly, in South Carolina, for
instance, most members of the Re-
publican Party were simply patron-
age seekers.)

In other words, this year a Re-
publican party is being organized
which will remain in existence af-
ter the presidential election is over.
This may explain the vigorous
support southern state democratic
leaders are giving the Kennedy-
Johnson ticket. A strong, grass-
roots Republican Party would put
the Democratic office-holding in-
dustry of the South in serious
jeopardy, and it seems that most
southern politicians are more con-
cerned with their staying in of-
fice without being endangered by
an upstart two-party system than
with any principles which might
influence their support.

Very little besides political self-
interest could tie a man like Ken-
nedy with men like Almond, Faubus,
Hollings, ete. (it might be said, how-
ever, that political opportunism is
the main characteristic of all these
men.) On top of all this comes the
curious campaign which is being
waged in the South for Kennedy. It
is broadly hinted that Kennedy has
made a deal with the South to go
easy on integration, perhaps to ap-
point a Southerner as attorney- gen-
eral. Governor Hollings of South
Carolina, in an important early
speech, said that the democratic plat-
form (to which the South so violent-

ly objected) was forced on Kennedy,

 

 

 

and that Jack didn’t really like it.
The fact is that the platform was
written by Chester Bowles, an ar-
dent Kennedy man, and Kennedy has
since endorsed the platform over and
over again, mentioning specifically
those sections on integration. Now,
obviously there is something wrong.
Someone is being misled. Were it
not for the fact that the South is a
relatively unimportant battlefield,
these contradictions would be forced
into the open and a choice made.

The publicists who are forever
denouncing the religious bigotry of
some of Nixon’s supporters (if
Kennedy wins, they’re going to
build a tunnel from the White
House to the Vatican) never say
anything about the racial bigotry
of the Kennedy supporters (Nix-
on is a card-carrying member of
the N.A.A.C.P.).

But these nasty little political
tricks show that the Democrats are
worried, which should encourage
the newly filedged southern Republi-
cans. Perhaps the South can now
have a real two-party system, which
it needs (it’s a gain in Louisiana
when Davis wins the primary in-
stead of Long) even if it means that
John Fitzgerald Kennedy must lose.
It’s not too great a price to pay.

TheReformation
Of ‘Bud Swizzle’

A strange sight caught my eye in
the Paramount the other night. It
was Bud Swizzle drinking a Coke.

Unable to restrain my curiosity, I
sat down at his table. Bud greeted
me jovially. “How are you, you old
..-’ he began, then checked him-
self,

“Old what?” I asked.

“Oh, I don’t know,..
maybe...”

Getting the drift of the wind, I
pursued: “Say Bud, you got a weed?”

“Well, I've only got five left, and
I was sort of saving those.”

“Why would anyone be saving
cigarettes?”

“T’ve got a plan,” he disclosed. “I
smoke two more today, two tomor-
row, one the next day—and then I’m
through with cigarettes.”

“And through with brew?” I asked,
nodding toward his nearly full glass
of Coke.

“Almost. I’m not drinking any-
time except between noon and mid-
night Saturdays.”

I asked Bud if someone had been
pressuring him.

“Helck, no,” he exclaimed.

“Helck?” I repeated.

“Oh, I forgot,” he mumbled, “I’m
allowed to say ‘hell’.”

“Who allows you?”

“Me. I allow myself. I’m nineteen
years old, and there’s no god...
there’s no goldarned reason why I
shouldn’t be able to determine how
the helck I live my own life!”

Seeing that Bud was in a defensive
mood now, I _ prodded further.
“Didn’t you give up smoking last
spring?”

“Well, yeah, but I was younger
then. Besides, I have a plan now.
I’ve got it all reasoned out.”

“Bud,” I said, “I really believe
you mean it. You must have a lot of
will power to throw off those old
habits. Yessir, Bud, you’re a man of
steel.”

“Yeah,” he said with satisfaction,
and gazed at the stuffed eagle on
the wall. Then he chugalugged his
Coke.

“Hey Larry,” he yelled to someone
at the bar. “Did you hear what I’ve
| done? I’ve mastered my vices!

Mr. Shaw’s words creep into many
a student’s mind, as he prepares tc
write a critical analysis of some as-
signed work. Only the version may
run somewhat more like this: “You

say about a work when I don’t know

Patriots, Reds
Join Forces In
Japanese Riots

By GEORGE BIRDSONG

The recent actions by Japanese stu-
dents have been of much concern to
students all over the world. Ameri-
can students find them especially note-
worthy since we feel the pressure of
their results. Evidently these students
played an important role in the cancel-
lation of President Eisenhower’s tour
of Japan, and in the difficulties in-
volved in ratifying the Security Treaty.

I have recently had contact with
some Americans in Japan who were
trying to find the causes behind the
actions of Japanese students. As a
result, after closer examination of
the situation, I feel that it deserves
reappraisal. A large number of the
students were neither communist nor
anti-American. They were merely
students who were doing what they
thought best.

Comprehension of the actions of
these students can be increased by
looking at the conditions under which
the Japanese students have had to live
during the past, and how these con-
ditions are presently affecting them.

Patriotism Blamed

The students are intensely patriotic.
They expressed themselves with vigor
in opposing the Japanese Security
Treaty and the man who was respon-
sible for its passage, Premier Kishi.
There actions seem to have resulted
from several influences. Contemporary
Japanese youth has been convinced,
particularly by the Communists, that
war between Russia-China and the
U.S.A. is inevitable, and that Japan
must remain neutral and not become
the battleground. The Japanese have
never seen Communism in action, nor
have their newspapers told them of the
horrors of Communist control in Eu-
rope and Asia. But they have seen and
experienced war and bombing. They
are, therefore, far more afraid of the
return of Militarism to Japan than of
the advent of Communism, which, with
its propoganda, has promised such
a rosy future.

In this light, we can see how well-
meaning students can be led into
participating in activities such as
those which took place in Japan
only a few months ago. So let us not
conclude that all these students were
Communist or anti-American, al-
though many of them obviously
were, The great majority were simp-
ly Japanese patriots acting in what
they considered to be the best inter-
est of their country.

This is not to say that we should dis-
miss as insignificant any concern over
these recent events. On the contrary,
it is indeed discouraging that these
students have been convinced that vio-
lent demonstrations were the means
by which they must make themselves
heard. It is our duty to help the Jap-
anese student become more familiar
with Communist tactics and overall
strategy. Perhaps many of _ these
events should be blamed on our own
inability to present convincingly our
point of view.

Generals Win Another

Red Devils Lose
In Second Game

The Washington and Lee Blue and
White increased their season’s winning
streak Saturday to 2-0 with their vic-
tory over the Red Devils of Dickin-
son. Two of the three Generals’ touch-
downs were made on pass plays with
the balance of the 23-6 score made up
of two runs and one conversion.

The first score of the game was
made by the Dickinson squad lead
by Walt Buckley, quarterback. The
45-yard scoring surge was begun
late in the first period and complet-
ed with a ten-yard pass to Roger
Smith who carried the ball to pay
dirt. The Red Devils failed to make
their extra point.

The Generals’ first score was made

in the second period when Steve Sut-

tle threw a ten-yard pass to end Dan ©
Blain and brought the score to a 6-6 |

tie. However, Jim Russ’s placement put
the Generals out front 7-6.

The Blue and White scored two

more TD’s in the second half due tog

Dickinson fumbles, an intercepted pass,
and a bad pass from center.

Suttle threw to end Ned Hobbs
for 36 yards and a third period score
after Bob Funkhouser had the only
pass interception of the game. Funk-
houser took a Walt Buckley pass on
his own 49 and carried it to the

Freshmen Triumph Over Woodberry Forest Team, 13-0

The Brigadier Generals, W&L’s
freshman football team, won their
second game last Friday with a
13-0 score against Woodberry For-
est. The team, sparked by quarter-
back John McDaniel, dominated the

the third quarter when the team
really began to break loose. The first
of the pair was carried by Mc Dan-
iel from the 1-yard line after a drive
downfield. Stuart Yoffe hit pay dirt

Steve Suttle Is
This Week’s Star

(Ed. note. The Washington and
Lee player of the week will be se-
lected on the basis of his perform-
ance in the previous Saturday’s
game by the sports staff of the Tues-
day Edition of the Ring-tum Phi.)

Last Saturday’s victory can be at-
tributed to many things, but the one
factor which seems to stand out above
all is the excellent performance of
quarterback Steve Suttle. Suttle, a 185-
pound junior from Uvale, Texas, illus-
trated in the Dickinson game that he
is not only an asset in the ground
game but also in passing, which was
predicted to be weak this year. In the
game against the Red Devils he com-
pleted six passes out of nine for a
total of 105 yards. Two of these passes
were good for touchdowns and in ad-
dition he ran two of the extra points.

Suttle’s showing, however, is a re-
‘sult not only of his skill as a passer
!and runner but also because of his
| leadership ability on the playing field.
'Coach Lee McLaughlin, commenting
on this aspect of Suttle’s performance,
said: “Suttle takes over the responsi-
bility of quarterback quite well, and
this is one of the reasons for our suc-
cess so far.”

Last season Steve won the team’s
award for the “toughest” player be-

THE NEW

The Coaches Corner

F&M Judged

It was a nice ride home from Car-

ten, and there was a general feeling
of well being.

We came from behind to win the
game. Dickinson slowed us up on the
ground but our passing game provided
our scoring punch.

Captain Courtney Mauzy is my
choice for an unsung star. His blocking
was again excellent and his centering
was perfect. He was also the first man
down field on punts.

The Coaches and players feel that
we have a greater potential than we
have shown thus far. Our tackling and
blocking must improve this weekend.

Franklin and Marshall, our next op-
ponent, stopped us last year after we
had won our first two games. We are
determined to play a better game this
year.

The “Diplomats” lost last week to a
fine Johns Hopkins team on the last
play of the game. Our scouts rate them
as a better team than the one which
beat us 28 to 14 last year. They have
a swift attack which features the run-
ning of John Tomasco.

It should be a very fine game....

Oddly tried again. “You’re fat and dumb and disagreeable,”
he said, ‘‘and you’ll be bald before you're thirty.”

“Hmm,” said Virginia thoughtfully and lit a cigarette. ‘This
sounds like an anxiety neurosis with totemism, anagogic trauma,
and a belt in the back.”

“Thate you,” said Oddly. “I hate your looks and your clothes
and your toenails and your relatives and the cigarettes you
smoke.”

her color mounting, her nostrils aflame. “Just keep a civil
tongue in your stupid head when you talk about Marlboro!

box while there’s breath in my body! It’s a full-flavored smoke,
it’s a doozy, it’s a dilly, it’s a gas—and anybody who says a
word against it gets this.”’

By “this” Virginia meant a series of combinations to the
head and liver, which she now delivered to Oddly and turned
on her heel and stormed away.

Oddly brought her down with a flying tackle. “I love you
with all my heart,” he said.

“And Marlboro?” said she.

“And Marlboro even more,” said he.

And they kissed and plaited love knots in one another’s hair

and were married at Whitsuntide and smoked happily ever after.

Sports Editorial

By STEVE GUILD

Last Saturday’s game against Dick-
inson has disproved another popular
belief that has afflicted the Generals’
football team for the past few seasons.
This belief was simply that we could
not win an away game. True, we did
win the Washington U. game last year
and missed the Sewanee game by only
a point but that was only “luck.”

However, a victory for the Blue and
White in their first away game of the
season proves that either our “luck”
has improved or that the team lost
their jinx and has more confidence. It
would seem that the latter is more
convincing.

The showing of the team, while not
spectacular and perhaps not as good as
was hoped, was a much different one
than the previous week. There was
noticed a greater concentration on the
passing game in opposition to the
ground game which had been predicted
to be the point of emphasis of this
year’s squad. Two of the three touch-
downs which our team scored were on
pass plays and figures show that we
completely routed the Red Devils in
passing yardage.

We are lucky that this week’s game
is another home game because the
Diplomats are sure to be the toughest
team we have met to date.

place finish took seven out the first
ten places.

Upon returning to Lexington,
Coach Dick Miller said, “Our boys
did very well considering the course
they ran. I think our showing Mon-
day well exemplifies our team bal-
ance. This is the one thing which
we have missed in the past years.”

This Saturday the cross-country
team meets Hampden-Sydney on our
home course. The meet will begin
at half-time of Washington and Lee’s
Homecoming game against Franklin
and Marshall.

Washington and Lee’s soccer team
rolled to its second straight win by
downing Randolph-Macon College
by a 3-0 count. All of the Generals’
goals were scored in the first quar-
ter.

Jim Starkey, playing the right in-
side position accounted for two of
the goals. Wick Hollingshead, right
wing, also scored for the five-star
Generals. Fine performances were
also turned in by linesmen Dick
Housley and Starkey. Frank Smith
performed exceptionally well at the
midfield position.

from the 3-yard line.

In assessing the team so far, Coach
Hal Bates had this to say: “This
year’s team has been coming along
very fine, perhaps even better than
last year’s. But we still need a lot
of work.” The coach also said he
thought the team did a fine job
Friday and that in the second half
we could have made as many touch
downs as there was time to make.

The frosh’s next game will be a
week from this Friday, October 14,
at Staunton Military Academy. This
is predicted to be one of the team’s
hardest games of the season.

game was a 3.0.
