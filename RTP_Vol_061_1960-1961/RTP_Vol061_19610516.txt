Students ‘Let Off Steam’
In Sunday Demonstration

Assistant Managing Editor

Every year about this time the men of many large
institutions such as Wisconsin, Clemson, Georgia Tech
and Texas A&M let off steam by staging “panty” raids.

There are no girls’ schools near

for a “panty” raid therefore, W&L’s men had to look
for another form of recreation in which they could let

off steam.

Sunday night an opportunity presented itself.

Then came the battle royal. The firemen, unable to
get close enough to the fire, turned the hoses on

SCHOOL’S POSITION ON DEMONSTRATION

The disturbance Sunday night calls for some comment. It is recog-
nized that such an outburst on a college campus at this time of the
year is certainly no new development. It is further noteworthy that
to the credit of Washington and Lee students, general reports indi-
cated no malicious misconduct, no damage to person or property and
no premeditated, planned misbehavior.

Two factors, however, clearly present such an episode as unde-
sirable. Regardless of Washington and Lee’s excellent reputation in
the eyes of the outside public, the news of such an outburst—fre-
quently exaggerated—is the poorest kind of public relations for the
students who are Washington and Lee.

An even more undesirable factor is that involving town relation-
ships, particularly with the Lexington Fire Department. This group
is one of ancient and honorable history, It is made up of men who
unhesitatingly give their time and service, at any hour of the day
or night, without any compensation other than the realization of valu-
able contribution rendered to their community. Many persons con-
nected with Washington and Lee recall instances where property of
the University and of a number of fraternities has been saved by the
group and at least one Washington and Lee student of recent years
owes his life to the members of this department. In the carrying
out of their duties they are deserving of the full support and co-
operation of every member of the Student Body and the whole

community of Lexington.

Concert To Be
At Wilson Field

By ANDY NEA
Managing Editor

Jimmy Reed, nationally
known rock ‘n’ roll recording

_ star, has been signed to play
at the Finals Dance Concert.

Reed’s appearance will mark
the first time that a rock ‘n’

roll singer has appeared at a
university concert. The con-

cert, scheduled for 3-5 p.m.
on Wednesday, May 31, will
be held on the grass at Wil-

- son Field.

Jimmy Reed ranks among all-time
recording greats in folk, rhythm and
blues, and jazz field. He is recog-
nized as one of the nation’s top
guitarists and singers. Reed has
consistently hit the “Top Twenty
Nationally” charts with each of his
recordings. Today he known as “the
man with the golden touch” by his

*¥ fellow artists.

He began his career in 1960 with
Vee Jay records and has been
producing hits for them ever since.
During his career, he has appeared
throughout the country at such
places as the Apollo Theatre in
New York, 502 Ballroom in Los
Angeles, and the Howard Theatre
in Washington. He has just com-
pleted a tour of the U.S. and Cana-
da with Lavern Baker, Clyde Mc-
Phatter and Lloyd Price.

The uninhibited, swinging rhythm
of Jimmy Reed has produced such
hits as Found Love, You Got Me
Dizzy, Going to Virginia, and Ca-
ress Me.

Commenting on the appearance
of Jimmy Reed, Dance Board Pres-
ident Jimmy Vann said, “Contract-
ing a Rock ’n’ Roll singer is an at-
tempt to bring the concerts more in
line with what many students seem
to desire. This type of entertain-
ment represents a definite change in
Dance Board policy. As is always
the case when changes are made,
it is necessary to proceed with max-
imum caution and good behavior.
The informality of the concert
coupled with the informality of the
entertainment could very easily
lend itself to misbehavior and dis-
order.”

Conventional dress will not be
required at this afternoon concert.
The Dance Board has stated that
it will not admit any couple not
dressed in a respectable manner.
Conventional bermudas and sport
shirts will be considered proper
attire.

There will be no drinking of any
kind at the open-air concert, and
no cups will be allowed. Violators
of this rule will be subject to ad-
ministrative action.

Finals Concert

Is The Factor

In Seeing If W&L Accepts Change

The appearance of today’s issue of the Ring-tum Phi brings
another year of our regular publishing to a close. The only
other issue of this paper to appear this year will be published
on May 30. That newspaper will be the Finals Edition.

Included in its pages will be photographs and comments
from this past school term. Each picture and comment will rep-
resent one of the many phases of W&L this year.

What kind of year has this been for Washington and Lee?

Physically, the University saw some changes take place with
work beginning on a number of long awaited projects.

In other areas the 1960-61 term also saw a great deal of
change. Student interest in such organizations as the Dance
Board and the Executive Committee soared to new heights,
and a greater interest was displayed in campus politics. Cam-
paign promises were made and platforms were aired with great
articulation and comment from all sources.

All these changes bring to mind one central question—
can W&L accept these changes?

A test of this student body’s ability to accept or reject
change will come in a few weeks when Finals Dances open.

The concert for this dance set will be held outside—an
event which hasn’t happened here in a number of years. The
administration has given the Dance Board permission to hold

the concert on Wilson Field.

With the green light given to the Dance Board to hold the
concert outside, the Administration has placed this stipulation:
“There will be no drinking of any kind at the open-air concert,
and no cups will be allowed. Violators of this rule will be sub-

ject to administrative action.”

This concert represents a ‘“‘test case’ fo rour student body
as far as any dance revision is concerned. If this concert is a
success and if no student is asked to appear before the Admin-
istration for violating this rule, we will then know that W&L

can accept change.

All future plans to strengthen and to improve the dance
program, therefore, hinge on this concert. If students obey
the rules during this event, then progress will be in order for
future dance revision. If the student body proves to the Admin-
istration that we, as students, are able to accept responsibility,
then we can expect to get a better dance program.

Perhaps, with a little luck, dances might be moved to the
Commons, and possibly drinking might be allowed in the near
future at dances. If, however, any of these possibilities are
ever to become realities, we must first prove that we can accept
the responsibilities of a better dance program.

The Dance Board has worked long and hard on better
dances for the student body. The next step now lies in the
student body’s conduct at the Finals concert.. Any possible
revision now depends on each and every student who attends

that concert.

PRESTON HOUSE

 

In Fifty Years House
Has Had Many Uses

By TOM LYBASS
Associate Editor

The long and variable existence of
Preston House came to an end last
week when its last remaining foun-
dation stones were removed by W.
W. Coffey and Son Construction
Company of Lexington, Virginia.

Used for many purposes, Preston
House had many different inhabi-
tants. At first, it was the residence
of Dr. and Mrs. F. Cleveland Davis,
who built it in 1910 when Washing-
ton Street was only a dirt road. Re-
maining at Preston House only a
few years, Dr. and Mrs. Davis later
moved to another part of the town.
Last week, Mrs. Davis, the last
living original owner of Preston
House, died in Jackson Memorial
Hospital.

After Dr. Davis moved, the
house was occupied by Dr.
Benjamin Easter, head of the W&L
French Department. During his
stay in the house, Dr. Easter con-
tinued the practice started by Dr.
Davis of renting attic rooms to
W&L students.

The house next changed hands
in the 1930’s when Dr. Easter sold
Preston House to Alpha Chi Rho
Fraternity, which in turn sold it to
W&L after several years of use.

For twenty years, Washington and
Lee University found a variety of
uses for Preston House. In the days
of subsidized football it was used
to house athletes. Afterwards, the
first floor of the house was con-
verted into the university medical
office and the second floor into an
apartment for people connected with
the university.

Master Sergeant Ralph Duffie,
an ROTC instructor, was the last

 

person to occupy the apartment-
ment before it was converted for
use into a temporary dormitory
for freshmen in 1959.

Few alterations were needed to
change Preston House into a dor-

mitory. Only several petitions and| ’

two showers were added. While its
familiar gray exterior remained the
same during the period of occu-
pancy by freshman, Preston House
underwent numerous changes in-
side. Most of these alterations were
made by its student occupants.

“In the last two years Preston
House has received more damage
than any other building owned by
the university,” reported Superin-
tendent of Grounds and Buildings,
Douglas Brady. Broken windows and
torn partitions were most often in
need of repair.

An inspection of Preston House
after evacuation in February
showed that in comparison with
another house owned by the uni-
versity as a freshman dormitory
a few years earlier and torn down
to make room for Davis Dormi-
tory, Preston House had sustained
little damage.

“The former temporary freshman
dormitory, also known as Preston
House, literally was taken apart
by its inhabitants during Finals
Weekend when it was announced
that the house was to be destroyed.
The students at the last Preston
House did very little damage,”
Brady said.

A much discussed question about!
Preston House was the origin of its
name. Actually, the name, Preston
House, was a misnomer. Originally,

‘End Party Politics In IFC, Let Group Do
Hang Itself’ --Honts

Something

By GEORGE HONTS
Tuesday Columnist

Monday, May 8—Tonight I wit-
nessed one of the most pathetic spec-
tacles on campus
—the IFC elec-
tions. The voting
went, as might be
* expected, right
2 down party lines.
It’s not that
Bob Doenges, Cy
Painter and the
other men elected
aren't qualified or
capable. They are,
and they could do
a good job if the
IFC had something to do. It’s not
the men elected which is disturbing,
but the method of election.

The IFC has been called the in-
ert-fraternity council. No wonder.
How can men who represent only
55 per cent of that body expect
to get 100 per cent co-operation
from it? It’s not fair to the of-
ficers, much less to the IFC as a
whole. But you 55 per cent who
hold the reins need not feel alone
in any criticism. If the Indepen-
dents were in the saddle the sit-
uation would be the same. That
wouldn’t help things a bit.

   

Honts

Maybe we ought to have two IFC’s.
One for the University Party and
one for the Independent Party.
Something might be accomplished

Useful Or

What’s the solution to the IFC
problem? A little unselfishness on
both sides and a fulfillment of cer-
tain needs. First, demand of and get
from Doegnes aggressive IFC lead-
ership. Second, keep the party poli-
tics out of the IFC. One step in
that direction would be an amend-
ment of the IFC constitution which
would make election of IFC officers
subject to a two-thirds vote. Third,
distribute IFC responsibility equally
among the houses according to their
capabilities and interest.. Fourth,
give the IFC enough rope to do
something or hang itself. As things
are now, the IFC is the black sheep
of the fraternity system. Fifth, if
Uncas McThenia is willing, let the

 

IFC be used as a partial base on
which to build the expected broad-
ened activity in student governmen-
tal affairs.

An unused limb will wither and
die. We'd better start giving the IFC
some exercise.

Craven Plans To Start Supporter Fund Drive
For Davidson College’s Poor David N. Dakin

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

Some of the closer reading readers among you
might possibly have noticed a little plea from David-

in our HONOR SYSTEM.

At Davidson I think you might have found what
we are looking for. You see, one of the main points
has been that honor cannot be codified, for the letter
killeth the spirit (or something like that that some-

 

then—if the parties could stick to-|

Roy Goodwin gave the nominating |

speech for the president. It was!
second in persuasiveness only to his
“Boll Weevil” speech of a year ago;
but it was a wasted effort, except for
one phase. He spoke at length of
the general decline of the Greek-
letter fraternities in America and
on the W&L campus. He said
Doenges was the type of individual
who could revive the fraternity
spirit. Well, Doenges might be, but
what chance will he have? A house
divided will fall: the IFC is split ten
to eight. If the Greeks can’t stand
together for themselves, no one will
do it for them.

What the IFC needs—perhaps the
whole campus needs—is a little less
party unity and a little more student
unity.

son tucked into a corner of the
sports page of the Friday edition.
I have spent a devoted year on the
Friday paper, and have always
considered this estimable journal
to be far-sighted and quick to pick
up the advantage when the oppor-
tunity arises. Now as a former
Friday columnist writing on Tues-
days, however, I think it only
fair to comment on Friday’s hand-
ling of the Davidson strap situation.
By commenting I feel I will be do-
ing two things—biting the hand

one said once, and I even think it was written down
somewhere). But the David N. Nakin case shows
that with proper handling the letter can just strap up
the spirit a little, and not kill it at all. Hence, I can-
not be indignent. I can only be proud that a school
like Davidson can see through the superficialities of
student life and can find out the rights and wrongs
existing on the campus. And then, after finding out
where some crime has been committed against the
honor of the college, an EC can act swiftly to mete
out punishment which is commensurate with the
foul deed.

Coming from North Carolina myself I can

that fed me while doing my little bit for the poor
guy who is still locked in his room at Davidson with
nothing but a box of soda crackers and about thir-

teen thousand used straps.

When the Ring-tum Phi received the press re-
lease from Davidson concerning the above-mentioned
convict, there was a note attached for me, from a
friend of mine at Davidson. He said, very succinctly,
“This crass injustice perhaps deserves some comment
(preferably indignent) in your column.” So the re-
mainder of this column will be in the form of an
open letter to my friend, and to Davidson.

Dear B. (that’s my friend’s name, and no-
body knows what it stands for).

In response to your note of last week I certainly
agree with you that the David N.
situation which needs comment more than just per-
haps. And so I am going to feel free to comment at
length, but unfortunately I am limited. So perhaps
the last three or four pages of this letter will have to
come to you under separate cover. At any rate,

here are my comments:

In your note you said that you would prefer indig-
nent comments. While I sympathize with your po-
sition, I feel that it is impossible for me to be indig-
nent. If you have read the Ring-tum Phi over the

only feel proud that honor is so revived in my
home state that a common thief, a man who will
be a blemish on the good name of Davidson, is

confined to the environs of your lovely town,

and not allowed to roam about society, per-
petrating more foul deeds.

I am also proud that your athletic department is
so conscientious that it keeps up with equipment so
well. I almost regret not going to Davidson instead
of W&lL. What a fine atmosphere must exist in a
place where the gym and the EC work hand-in-hand
to rid the college of any evil influences.

I’m afraid, B.,

that my feelings have run away with

me, and that I have almost abstracted the whole

case too much.

Dakin case is a

course of the past several months, you might have
noticed a vocal minority pushing for some changes

But I will not forget the concretes

of the situation. Conscious of the fact that your
exams must be starting soon, I realize what a sense
of urgency must be felt at Davidson when the short-
age of straps was discovered. I can’t imagine how
horrible it must be.

So, in response to your request, I’m trying to get
up a fund to help send all you needy students sev-
eral extra straps per man. For the more affluent
among you, I will try to send madras ones. I hope
we can help before it’s to late, and David N. Dakin
is released to begin his rampage once more.

Students’ Revolt For Reform In Recent Campus Elections
Inherited From Founders Of Country

Shows Action

By DAVE KNIGHT
Tuesday Columnist

As the school year draws to a
close, it is only natural that a cer-
tain amount of
reminiscing will
occur concerning
the successes or
failures of the
present student
body. Seniors, in
particular, must
either consciously
or subconsciously
ask themselves
whether or not
the University has
benefited from
their presence. There are those who
have contributed through direct
participation in student affairs and,
therefore, know the answer. The
rest, on the other hand, may review
their activities on campus with a
sense of regret in relation to ac-
complishment for themselves and
Washington and Lee.

But there has been one event for
which every member of the student
body can take credit in terms of con-
tributing sufficiently to the heritage
for us by our renowned founders of
both the American Revolution and
the Civil War era. The event was
the campus elections.

 

Knight

The contribution was the mature
attitude adopted by the students
when faced with a possible cha-
otic situation. This siutation was
the result of a plea for radical
changes in basic structures of our
student government.

The term “radical” is not to be
interpreted as having a detrimental
connotation for a great deal of credit
must go to those who stirred the
winds of liberalism in advocating the

 

afore-mentioned changes. But, at the
same time, thanks must be extended
to those students who, through their
role as campus leaders, managed to
apply or mold this liberalism into a

constructive force.

One only has to survey the world
scene to find numerous examples of
reform through revolt. A better il-

Letter to the Editor

Lab Does Not

‘Torture’ Mice

Editor Tuesday Edition
Dear Sir:

The students and members of the
faculty in the Department of Psy-
chology appreciate the interest and
the fine coverage given the activities
of the department by the Ring-tum
Phi during the current school year.
However, since a portion of the cap-
tion on page 4 of the May 12, 1961
issue may be misunderstood by some,
we would suggest that the word
“torture” is hardly the correct word
to describe the experience resulting
from the occasional, necessary use in
experimental work of stimuli which
are annoying but not painful. Be
assured no subject, whether animal
or human will ever be “tortured”
in our laboratory.

WILLIAM H. HINTON
Head—Psychology
Department

 

new policies is the street barrier, fire
hose type riot generally associated
with the Ivy League. In using a
more familiar analogy an atmos-
phere or attitude responsive to riots
might have turned the assembly in
which candidates for campus offices
were allowed to express their views
into something resembling the Mock
Convention of last year.

Instead of this, however, the move-
ment towards reform had a sober-
ing effect on the students who re-
sponded in a manner characteristic
of our heritage. Therefore, I extend
my congratulations to those who ad-
vocated changes, those who were in
power to enact these changes, and
the student body for their contribu-
tions towards a job well done.

Carpenter Mows Down Tigers As Baseball Team Wins Last One

Roy Carpenter closed out his col-
lege pitching career by leading the
Generals to a 4-2 victory over
the Hampden-Sydney Tigers.

Carpenter, who pitched four hit
ball Saturday, finished the season
with a 5-2 record, as the Generals
went unbeaten on their home dia-
mond.

The W&L team took an early lead
when in the first inning Buck Rose
got on first base by swinging at a
two-strike pitch that sailed a foot

 

over the catcher’s head. Chuck Lane
put down a bunt that Tiger pitcher
Milliron threw into center field in an
attempt to get Rose. Ned Hobbs
struck out but Bobby Williams lash-
ed a double to right to score Rose
and Lane.

Chuck Lane Scores

W&L picked up another run in
the third when Lane reached first
on a throwing error by the pitcher,
and continued to second when the

 

ball rolled under the stands. Hobbs’
sacrifice moved him to third, and
Williams batted in his third run of
the game by sacrificing Lane home.

The last W&L run came in the
sixth when Robin Wood led off with
a single, was sacrificed to second
by Gilmore, took third on Martin’s
infield out, and scored on a wild
pitch.

the eighth of the year, and brought

and Lee’s lacrosse; two defensemen, Bart Mitchell and

Bill Wheeler, were chosen co-cap-
tains for next year.

Coach Bob McHenry said that he
was very pleased with the Generals’
effort against such strong opposition,
and that he thought this was one of
the two best games that the stick-
men played this year. “It was,” he
said, “our best combined effort of
the year.” He went on to add that
he thought the return of Ray Gor-
don to the lineup after a month’s
absence due to injury helped the
W&L cause, and that Tracht and
Powers both played their best games
of the season. McHenry also cited
Charlie Gummey’s play at midfield.

McHenry To Coach South
In All-Star Lacrosse Game

Robert McHenry, head lacrosse coach at W&L, was named
today as head coach of the South team for this year’s North-

South game.

He will oppose his brother Bill,*

who is head mentor at Williams.

The game, to be played on Sat-
urday, June 10, at the Naval Aca-
demy in Annapolis, Md., annually
pits 25 players from Northern col-
leges against 21 of the South’s best
lacrosse players.

W&L this year will be represent-
ed by John Dinkel, senior defense-
man and co-captain.

McHenry, speaking of the fact that
his brother will oppose him as head
coach of the North squad, said, “I’d
like to beat him. He’s the one that
ate all the vitamin pills.” Bill Mc-
Henry captained the last subsidized
football team at W&L, and was
All-Southern Conference and Hon-
orable Mention All-American at
center for the Generals.

Coach McHenry will be able to

pick players from five of the
top eight lacrosse teams in the

nation. He has already sent out
invitations to the players, but
hasn’t received any replies yet.

“If there’s any weakness in our
team,” he said, “it will be at mid-
field. I think we'll make it a real
good game.”

As for the North squad, McHenry
said, “My brother’s crying. No mat-
ter what he has, he’s always crying.
But he’ll come up with a good club.”

McHenry’s list of possible players
for the dream game includes four
second-team All-Americans from
last year, two defensemen, one mid-
fielder, and an attackman.
