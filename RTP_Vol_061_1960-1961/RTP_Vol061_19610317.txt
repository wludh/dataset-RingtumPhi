Chemistry Professor’s Home
By Fire Thursday

Leveled

     
   

ew

A Washington and Lee chemistry
professor and his wife were forced
to jump to safety from the porch
roof as a fire leveled their home
early Thursday morning.

A young, unidentified boy who
was passing the house alerted the
R.D. Whitakers of the fire—possi-
bly saving their lives—and called
the Buena Vista fire department
about 6:40 a.m. Thursday.

The Whitakers lost everything
in the house.

According to Buena Vista fire
chief Ralph Flint the house was
almost totally destroyed when his
crew arrived. F. J. Dunn, Lexing-
ton fire chief, said one of the local
trucks was dispatched to the
scene in response to a call about
9 a.m.

The house was totally destroyed
by that time, he said, but there
was danger of brush fire spreading

‘Shangri-La’ Is Central Theme
Of Spring Dances Says Outman

Bill Outman, PiKA junior and
president of Spring Dances, an-
nounced today that the theme of this
year’s dance set will be “Shangri-
La.”

Outman is working with Elliott
Maynard, a PiKA junior who is
in charge of decorations for next
month’s dance set.

Outman said today that the dance
set vice-presidents are “combining
in an all-out effort to make this
year’s decorations as striking and as
authentic as possible.”

The traditional dance-concert will
be staged this Spring in surround-
ings adapted from the work, Lost
Horizon, by James Hilton.

In keeping with the oriential motif
suggested by Hilton in his search for
life’s ideal, Doremus Gymnasium
will be gayly pictured as “Shangri-
La.”

 

Outman said that he plans to have
murals placed around the walls of
the dance floor, and he added that
plans call for the construction of a
Chinese Pagoda as the center of all
the murals.

A small pond with accompanying
waterfall will complete the major
decorations for the dance floor itself,

‘he said.

Outman added that the vice-presi-
dents, who were named last week,
will meet Tuesday night.

Spring Dances will be held on
April 14 and 15.

Last year the Spring Dances theme
was “Paris and the Moulin Rouge.”

President of that dance set was
Phi Delt Bill McWilliams. High-
lighting last year’s dances were the
appearances of Claude Thornhill and
Joni James.

(Editor’s note: The following ar-
ticle was received by the Ring-tum
Phi a few days ago. It is an ex-
planation of what the Peace Corps
actually is, and what the program
hopes to accomplish. It is reprinted
here for the benefit of persons who
might be interested in the Peace
Corps. It is continued on page 2.)

PEACE CORPS
Washington 25, D.C.

In response to the numerous
requests for information about the
Peace Corps which have been re-
ceived by this office, we are trans-
mitting a copy of the memoran-
dum prepared by Mr. Sargent
Shriver and submitted to Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy prior to the
President’s issuance of an Execu-
tive Order establishing the Peace
Corps.

We believe that this document
will answer any of the questions
that have been asked about the
purpose and programs of the
Peace Corps. An information fold-
er which answers some of the
more detailed queries about speci-
fic operational policies will be
ready for distribution at a later
date.

Sincerely,

Edwin R. Bayley
Public Information

* *

1. What do we mean by a Peace

Corps?

The essential idea is the placement
of Americans in actual operational
work in newly developing areas of
the world. Unlike most ICA tech-
nical assistance advisors, who go as
members of an official U.S. mission to
demonstrate or advise, Peace Corps
volunteers will go to teach, or to
build, or to work in the communi-
ties to which they are sent. They
will serve local institutions, living
with the people they are helping.
Most Peace Corps volunteers will
probably be young college graduates,
but there should be no rigid age

Government’s P

limit. Younger or older workers with
skills needed abroad but without
college degrees will carry out some
important projects. The length of
service should normally be from two
to three years.

2. Is there a need for it?

The need of most newly develop-
ing nations for skilled manpower in
many critical positions is manifest.
The Colorado State University team
reports that the need for trained
Peace Corps volunteers is felt in
every country in Latin America,
Africa, and Asia visited. If the short-
ages of able personnel are not made
up from outside some development
programs will grind to a halt—or
fail to progress fast enough to satis-
fy the newly aroused and volatile
expectations of the people of these
lands. The Peace Corps can make
a significant contribution to this
problem.

While Dr. Maurice Albertson of
Colorado State University and his
colleagues report a great variety of
needs in the countries visited, the
major programs in which Peace
Corps volunteers are wanted are
these:

a. Teaching. Literacy and higher
levels of knowledge and skills are a
prerequisite to successful national
development. In most newly de-
veloping nations the shortage of
teachers is a major bottleneck. In
Nigeria an official commission has
just documented how dangerous this
bottleneck is—and how badly out-
side teachers are needed. Since in
many African and some Asian coun-
tries teaching is conducted in Eng-
lish, U.S. college graduates could
play a vital role teaching in pri-
mary or secondary schools and in
trade schools. In many other de-
veloping nations the teaching of
English is wanted. And in Latin
America the teaching of literacy in
Spanish is required—a useful field
for Spanish-speaking U.S. graduates.

b. Fighting Malaria and Working
in other Health Projects. The world-

 

another important contribution to
economic development. The UN-
sponsored campaign to eradicate ma-
laria needs a large number of work-
ers, many of whom would not need
to be college graduates.

c. Working in Agricultural Pro-
jects and Rural Development Pro-
grams. In addition to top-level tech-
nical advisors already being pro-
vided by ICA and other agencies,
skilled agricultural workers are
needed to assure the effectiveness
of demonstration programs for ani-
mal husbandry, new farm tech-
niques, improvement of seed, and ir-
rigation. Peace Corps volunteers are
needed to work alongside host coun-
try citizens in community develop-
ment programs.

d. Working on Large-Scale Con-
struction and Industrial Projects.
On most of the large dams, valley
developments, construction of new
cities, or establishment of modern
factories, the employment of skilled
operating personnel from outside has
been necessary to do a great range
of skilled and semi-skilled jobs. If
proper terms of service can be ar-
ranged, Peace Corps volunteers from
trade unions or U.S. business can
provide some of the needed help,
including on-the-job training to
local personnel.

e. Working in Government Ad-
mininistration. Many Peace Corps
volunteers will be needed in a pub-
lic administration on all levels,
including urban development.

These are some of the clear and
present needs. It will be important
for the Peace Corps to establish pro-
cedures with the host countries for
the appraisal of each project in terms
of the particular country’s priorities
of development needs. When there is
no pressing need or desire—where
local persons are trained and ready—
no Peace Corps volunteers should
be sent.

3. How would it operate?

 

wide Malaria Eradication program is

 

The Peace Corps staff must have} ularly

great flexibility to experiment with
different methods of operation. Its
role, as we see it, will be to rein-
force existing private and _ public
programs of assistance and develop-
ment by filling some of the man-
power gaps which obstruct these
programs requiring Peace Corps
volunteers. The Peace Corps will be
closely related to other programs
of assistance, and its potentialities
will of course depend in part upon
what is done through other parts of
our foreign aid effort. The Peace
Corps should take its place as a
basic component of our whole over-
seas program.

a. Through grants to Peace Corps-
type programs carried out by pri-
vate agencies. This would result in
the expansion of the existing volun-
tary agency activities using dedi-
cated Americans overseas, and in the
encouragement of other private or-
ganizations to undertake such pro-
jects. Trade Unions would be urged
to participate in this program. It
is important that the Peace Corps
supplement and extend the early
pioneer efforts of the private agen-
cies rather than by-pass them or
swallow them up in a Federal pro-
gram. Under this program private
agencies would submit proposed
Peace Corps-type projects to the
Peace Corps staff. These projects
would be reviewed in the light of
Peace Corps standards and funds
would be allocated according to the
priorities determined and the total
budget available.

b. Through arrangement with col-
leges, universities, or other educa-
tional institutions. Already some 57
universities are working under con-
tract with ICA in 37 countries on
development or educational projects.
While few, if any, of these contracts
presently meet the criteria of the
Peace Corps, they demonstrate the
possibilities. Universities are capable
of carrying the responsibility of
many Peace Corps projects, partic-
in the field of education.

 

Teachers College at Columbia Uni-
versity has just recently agreed to
recruit and administer a program
of supplying some 150 English
teachers for East Africa. Larger
teaching projects might be carried
out by a group of colleges and uni-
versities in a state or area, or by
a group of schools emphasizing the
same language or area study.

Universities offer several advant-
ages; they are able to recruit on
the spot, from among their own stu-
dents, using their own knowledge of
the student as a basis for selection.
They are able to provide the train-
ing either over a four-year period
or in special training sessions after
graduation. They can provide facul-
ty as supervisors overseas. They can
develop area studies and research
programs which assist their Peace
Corps volunteers and which also
benefit from what the returning vol-
unteers have learned .

And the Peace Corps can help the
Universities by giving new purpose

| to the student during his years of

study. One University official already
reports that students are studying
Spanish more seriously in view of
the prospect of a University Peace
Corps project in Latin America.

The Peace Corps staff will need
in many cases to seek out a uni-
versity or group of universities to
undertake particular projects sug-
gested by the particular developing
nation or nations. In most cases the
Peace Corps staff will be needed in
the initial negotiations with foreign
governments.

Although there is no reason to be-
lieve that the costs of carrying out
Peace Corps projects through uni-
versity contracts will be low, the
advantages of this approach should
weigh heavily against any ineffi-
ciency in such _ decentralization.
Wherever feasible it is recommended
that Peace Corps projects be con-
ducted in this way.

c. Through programs of other U.S.
Government agencies. There is a
need for “Technical Helpers” to sup-

 

plement many existing technical and
economic assistance projects being
carried.out by existing U.S. Govern-
ment agencies. Top-level advisors
working for I.C.A., or for the U.S.
Information Service, or for other
Government agencies all generally
report the need for operational as-
sistance—for personnel at the work-
ing level who can help translate
high-level advice into action on the
line. Through a national recruit-
ment, training and placement serv-
ice the Peace Corps can supply such
Technician Helpers.

d. Through programs of the UN
and other international agencies. UN
and other international technical as-
sistance and development programs
also suffer the same gap between
the advice and its implementation.

e. Through directly administered
Peace Corps programs with host
countries. There will be some pro-
jects of a size or complexity or
novelty or urgency which cannot
be carried out, or carried out well,
through any of the above channels.
If such projects are proposed by host
countries and fit the development
needs of those countries and the
overall foreign aid purposes of the
United States, they can be under-
taken through Peace Corps recruit-
ment, training, and direct adminis-
tration.

4. How would the Peace Corps vol-
unteers be selected?

For projects administered directly
by the Peace Corps there will have
to be a general nation-wide re-
cruitment program. Although pri-
vate agencies and universities will
be able to recruit directly and sep-
arately for their respective pro-
jects, they, too, may often wish to
utilize the central recruitment serv-
ice. And the central service, in turn,
will probably want to have in its
files the results of the separate re-
cruitment by private agencies and
universities.

Therefore, one important function

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

She Ring-tum Phi
Next Steps In Development Urged

Two of the most obvious problems that
presently confront the Washington and Lee
community are probably (1) the need of an
adequate auditorium in which to hold assem-
blies as well as dramatic productions, and (2)
the need of additional parking facilities.

We are all well aware that the Adminis-
tration has a number of pressing issues which
must be dealt with, new buildings for science
and journalism, for instance. We are certainly
the first to understand that issues must be
dealt with in order of their priority. To re-
iterate a stand which has been our general
policy throughout the year, we hail the “New
Era,” and we appreciate the progress which
has been realized by the Administration over
the last few years.

In an editorial written a few weeks ago,
the Administration was praised for its an-
nouncement that work was soon to begin
on three overdue facilities—a new science
building, a remodelled Reid Hall, and a new
dormitory for freshmen.

We feel, however, that we are obligated
to make the following suggestions concern-
ing the “next steps” that will be taken in
the realization of W&L’s Development pro-
gram.

Not only is Lee Chapel far too small to
serve as a place in which to hold university
assemblies, but the matter of the “physical
soundness” of the building is also in question.
This last statement was made apparent dur-
ing this year’s International Relations Week,
when Norman Thomas spoke to an overflow
crowd in the chapel. We feel that the ex-
cellent speech was marred, however, by the
assembly chairman’s having to request stu-
dents not to sit near the front of the
balcony, for fear that the structure in ques-
tion might tumble at a moment’s notice.

Not only is an auditorium greatly needed
for University assemblies, but the present fa-
cilities available for dramatic productions cer-
tainly leave much to be desired.

The Troub Theatre, although it has re-
cently been renovated is still in need of many
additions which would bring the physical char-
acter of the building up to a level with the
excellent productions being presented by the
various student dramatic organizations.

The present Doremus Gymnasium, which
has the rather dubious distinction of serving as

 

a part-time gym-auditorium should also be
considered. The gymnastic facilities offered
are indeed lacking and as far as its use as an
auditorium is concerned, the present structure
lacks both good appearance and acoustics.

We therefore suggest that the next build-
ing to go up on the W&L campus be an audi-
torium—one which could be used for assem-
blies, concerts, speeches, and for dramatic
productions.

NEW PARKING FACILITIES URGED

Another area that we see as being “‘lack-
ing” at the present time is in the parking fa-
cilities available for both student and facul-
ty use.

The number of student owned automobiles,
from all indications, seems to be increasing
every year, but the amount of parking space
available seems to be, if anything, on the gen-
eral decline.

In 1957, former Washington and Lee
President Francis P. Gaines announced in his
Ten Year University Development Program
that expanded parking areas were eventually
to be constructed.

As was pointed out in the Nov. 22, 1957
issue of the Ring-tum Phi, this plan called for
added parking space providing for 1,430
cars.

The areas for expanded parking which were
suggested were (1) the upper athletic field
near Liberty Hall (2) the area behind the
gym (3) the corner of Washington and Jef-
ferson Streets (the area across from the Uni-
versity Cleaners’ building). and (4) the area
behind the science building where the present
Biology Annex is located.

If the present Administration does not
feel that the above named areas would be
suited for use for additional parking, we would
further suggest that perhaps the enclosed
green in front of the Doremus Gymnasium
could be removed. This spot, to our thinking,
serves no specific purpose, and the area gained
would perhaps give a sizeable increase to the
space now alloted for parking.

Both these facilities, if built, would cer-
tainly give the student body a further reassur-
ing note that the “New Era’s” ideals are here
to stay.

Letters To The Editor

Readers’ Opinions Vary On Goldwater

Editor, Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sirs:

I was impressed by Mr. Ketcham’s
article of March 3 (Many of Gold-
water’s Ideas Need Revision). He
has, however, in the student’s pas-
sionate search for Truth, left un-
listed some points that might be of
interest to his faithful readers.

1). Sufficient money for compe-
tent schools can and is being raised
by individual states, not only by
property, but by sales taxes. (Fi-
nancing the Public Schools, by
Roger Freeman, Institute for Social
Science Research, Washington, D.C.).

2). The U.S. Office of Education, a
source of Mr. Ketcham’s figures, is
not exactly dispassionate on the
subject of Federal Aid to Education.
Its leaders are recognized Dewey-
ites (and I don’t mean Thomas) who
are admittedly working toward a
centralized system of formal edu-
cation which would eventually re-
place such mind builders as Latin,
Greek and Math with “Personality
Adjustment,” “Society and Marri-
age,” etc. Naturally, the question of
control has been left unmentioned in
the Kennedy Plan.

3). Only 237 of 40,000 plus school
districts have demonstrated a need
for help in school construction, no
small sacrifice for the destruction of
the Constitutional system of divi-
sion of powers.

4), States can hardly be expected
to accelerate school construction and
raise teachers’ salaries when Big
Brother in Washington is tempting
them with a seemingly painless pan-
acea.

5).Sen. Goldwater is correct when
he says “there is no demonstrable
need” for social security financed
medical care. Those over 65 who are
“starving” have been provided for
under the Kerr-Mills bill passed last
fall.

6). If we we to follow Sen. Gold-
water and not recognize Russia,
what would most likely follow would
be respect from neutral nations. (But
then where would the Government

 

find jobs for all those people cur-
rently trying to find out which na-
tions “like” us and which don’t).

Finally, in reference to your con-
cluding paragraph, what would in-
finitely be sadder and more appal-
ling would be college students look-
ing toward the Government for sup-
port and guidance throughout their
entire lives in return for continued
sustenance.

That my friend, not Russia or Red
China, is where the basic danger
lies.

Sincerely,

The Eastern Underwriter
New York 30, New York

Dear Sirs:

I wish to take exception to a
statement appearing in your edi-
torial, dated March 3, 1961, entitled
“In the ‘Liberal Spirit’...Senator
Barry Goldwater.” The statement is
... “there is no precedent in the
past for the United States to take
the offensive and provoke warfare,
yet this is what the senator pro-
poses to do.”

I suggest that the writer look
up a little book entitled “The War
Myth in United States History” by
C. H. Hamlin of Atlantic Christian
College, published by the Vanguard
Press of New York (1927). I could
quote many passages from this book
to substantiate the fact that the
United States did take the offensive
and provoke warfare. I have the
definite impression he would not
make the above statement if he had
sufficient facts.

Sincerely,
Edward Palmer, M.D.
Berwyn, Iil.

March 2, 1961

Dear Mr. Simpson:

Sitting here in The Flat Hat of-
fice at William and Mary I came
across the Ring-tum Phi for Feb-
ruary 24, and read with a good deal

 

of interest your editorial entitled
“Conscience Of A Liberal”—an at-
tempt, I suppose, to answer Mr.
Goldwater and his “Conscience of
A Conservative.” I think, however,
that to some extent you have missed
most of the point.

The spirit of liberalism is liberty,
I agree, but this holds true only
in its classical sense, the sense in
which Locke believed it and Jeffer-
son wrote it. What is called “liberal-
ism” today is really just another
manifestation of statism, something
we have seen many times in the
history of the world. It is not “liber-
al” to say, as our “liberals” say so
often, that it is the function of the
government to do what must be
done. This, if we were to really try
to find its base, is European conser-
vatism—reverence for authority—
going back to feudalism. Conserva-
tism today in 20th century America
is trying to conserve the liberal
values which came out of our revo-
lution. There can be, therefore, noth-
ing very static about a conservatism
whose base is revolutionary—the
American Revolution.

What you are really talking about,
I think, is a conservative vs. liberal
spirit in individuals, and here I
agree that innovation and whole-
some change is good. But we don’t
want to change the basic values we
have learned from history, what-
ever we must do is reapply them to
modern situations, and here is the
difference between a _ conservative
and a reactionary.

Conformity and complacency ex-
ist more in our “liberals” who are
trying to face 1961 with a depression
psychology than with conservatives.
And when you say that conservatives
are making Goldwater a prophet and
hero I think you are wrong, except
of course in many individual cases.
Conservatism is based on a respect
for rule by law and not men, and
such a philosophy is not very adapt-
able to hero worship. This is for the
“liberals”—note FDR and the cur-
rent job being done on Kennedy.

(Continued from page 1)

of the Peace Corps staff will be to
set up and maintain a general re-
cruitment and_ selection process,
which can build up a pool of ap-
plicants and serve as a central place-
ment center for volunteers for world
development.

As a practical matter the Peace
Corps will need a large pool of ap-
plicants, if the best available talent
is to be found. Widespread compe-
tition for Peace Corps positions with
very careful screening is essential if
people with the best chance of suc-
cess are to be sent abroad.

5. How would the volunteers be
trained?

Once the Peace Corps is a going
concern, training for it should be
integrated so far as possible within
four year college curriculum of stu-
dents interested in going overseas
after graduation. The Peace Corps
should set standards such as inten-
sive language study and completion
of courses on the history, econom-
ies, politics, and culture of the area
to which the student would like
to be sent—as well as sufficient
study of American history and so-
ciety to make him a well-informed
representative of this country
abroad.

The Peace Corps must organize
such training programs, using col-
lege university facilities wherever
feasible. The length of the programs
would vary from six weeks to per-
haps even six months. There will be
great emphasis on language instruc-
tion and preparation for the particu-
lar work to be assigned such as
teaching. There will also be briefing
on practical problems of health and
living in the country assigned.

Whenever possible foreign students
and teachers in this country will be
involved in the training program.

6. What would be the terms of serv-
ice?

The usual length of service should
probably be two years, with perhaps
three year terms in some cases.
Great flexibility must be permitted
to accommodate projects with dif-
fering difficulties and needs.

From the training period through-
out his term of service, the Peace
Corps volunteer would be subject
to immediate separation from the
service and return home.

While there should be no general
age limit or restriction to one sex,
there will be particular projects
requiring special maturity and some
open only to men or to women. The
Peace Corps should not pay the
expenses of a wife or family unless,
the wife is also accepted for full-
time Peace Corps work.

Peace Corps volunteers obviously
should not be paid what they might
earn in comparable activities in the
United States. Nor would it be pos-
sible in many cases for them to live
in health or any effectiveness on
what their counterparts abroad are
paid. The guiding principle indeed
should not be anything like com-
pensation for individual services.

Rather the principle should be
akin to that of the allowance. Peace
Corps volunteers should be given
just enough to provide a minimum
decent standard of living. Wherever
possible they should live with their
host country counterparts. It prob-
ably will be necessary for the Corps
to have authority to pay medical ex-

 

penses of volunteers.

For readjustment to the U.S., vol-
unteers should be given some sepa-
ration allowance at the end of their
overseas service, based on the length
of time served.

7. In what part of the government
should the Peace Corps be estab-
lished?

The idea of a Peace Corps has
captured the imagination of a great
many people. The Peace Corps,
therefore, offers an opportunity to
add a new dimension to our ap-
proach to the world—an opportunity
for the American people to think
anew and start afresh in their par-
ticipation in world development.

Pending the reorganizaztion of our
foreign aid structure and program,
the Peace Corps should be estab-
lished as an agency in the Depart-
ment of State. Meanwhile, the Peace
Corps could be physically located
in the ICA’s facilities and depend on
the State Department and ICA for
administrative support and, when
needed, program assistance.

8. How and when should the Peace
Corps be launched?

The Peace Corps can either begin
in very low gear, with only prepara-
tory work undertaken between now
and when Congress finally appropri-
ates special funds for it—or it can
be launched now and in earnest by
executive action, with sufficient
funds and made available from ex-
isting Mutual Security appropria-
tions to permit a number of sub-
stantial projects to start this sum-
mer.

The Peace Corps should be
launched soon so that the opportuni-
ty to recruit the most qualified peo-
ple from this year’s graduating
classes will not be lost.

If launched in a careful but de-
termined way within the next few
weeks, the Peace Corps could have
several hundred persons in train-
ing this summer for placement next
Fall.

9. What would the first projects be?

In the first year there should
probably be considerable emphasis
on teaching projects. The need here
is most clearly felt and our capacity
to recruit and train qualified vol-
unteers in a short period of time
is greatest.

There would, however, be a varie-
ty of other skills—medical, agricul-
tural, engineering—which would be
called for in the first year through
private agency programs.

The first year’s projects should
also be spread through several
countries in Latin America, Africa
and Asia.

10 How will the Peace Corps be
received abroad?

Although the need for outside
trained manpower exists in every
newly developing nation, the readi-
ness to receive such manpower, or
to receive it from the United States,
will vary from country to country.
A certain skepticism about the com-
ing of Americans is to be expected
in many quarters. Unfriendly politi-
cal groups will no doubt do every-
thing in their power to promote ac-
tive hostility. But there are indica-
tions that many developing nations
will welcome Peace Corps volun-
teers.

It is important, however, that the
Peace Corps be advanced not as an

 

 

arm of the Cold War but as a con-
tribution to the world community.
In presenting it to other govern-
ments and to the United Nations,
we could propose that every na-
tion consider the formation of its
own peace corps and that the Unit-
ed Nations sponsor the idea and
form an international coordinating
committee. We should hope that
peace corps projects will be truly
international and that our citizens
will find themselves working along-
side citizens of the host country and
also volunteers from other lands.

The Peace Corps is not a diplo-
matic or propaganda venture but
genuine experiment in international
partnership. Our aim must be to
learn as much as we teach. The
Peace Corps offers an opportunity
to bring home to the United States
the problems of the world as well
as an opportunity to meet urgent
host country needs for trained man-
power.

11. How will it be financed?

The already appropriated funds
within the discretion of the Presi-
dent and Secretary of State under
the Mutual Security Act are the only
immediately available source of fi-
nancing this summer’s pilot pro-
grams of the Peace Corps. If it
is decided to make a small shift
which may be required from military
aid or special assistance funds, in
order to carry out the purposes of
the Mutual Security Act through
this new peaceful program, this will
be a hopeful sign to the world. Con-
gress should then be asked to give
the Peace Corps a firm legislative
foundation for the next fiscal year.

Specifically, Congress should con-
sider authorizing the Peace Corps
to receive contributions from Amer-
ican businesses, unions, civic organ-
izations and the public at large.

The extent to which participating
bodies such as U.S. voluntary agen-
cies, universities, international or-
ganizations, and the host country or
institutions in the host country can
and should share the costs of the
Peace Corps program must be fully
explored.

12. Is it worth the cost and the
risks?

No matter how well conceived
and efficiently run, there probably
will be failures. These could be
costly and have a serious effect
both at home and abroad.

But as the popular response sug-
gests, the potentiality of the Peace
Corps is very great. It can contribute
to the development of critical coun-
tries and regions. It can also con-
tribute to more intelligent American
participation in the world.

With the colleges and universities
carrying a large part of the program,
and with students looking toward
Peace Corps Service, there will be
an impact on educational curricu-
lum and student seriousness. This is
meeting the world’s need since what
the world most needs from this
country is a better understanding of
the world.

The Peace Corps thus can add
a new dimension to America’s world
policy—one for which people here
and abroad have long been waiting.
As you said in your State of the
Union message, “The problems...
are towering and unprecedented—
and the response must be towering
and unprecedented as well.”

‘Protest’ Protester Is Protested
From Footsteps To Material

By THORNS CRAVEN

Friday Columnist

Since the Tuesday Edition of this
admirable bi-weekly journal saw
fit last Tuesday to
devote almost
one-fourth of the
issue to various
comments on
Grayfred Gray,
ranging from the
statement that
he supported
Woodrow Wilson
in 1912 (or was it
19167), to shifting
his colorful name
from drab Gray to
a more neutral Brown, it seems only
right that I should keep a good thing
going. But a problem arises when I
try to decide which means to use
to discuss this campus phenomenon,
and the phenomena which have been
produced as by-products. I’ve had
to rule out fables and fairy tales;
the interview has been done; and

Craven

 

reiteration of the good points and
the bad would just be repetition
(or reiteration, take your choice).
So I’ve decided that the best way
to treat PROTEST and its author-
publisher-printer-financer-distribu-
tor-paper boy, is to PROTEST.

Before I get started with that
though, let me make it clear that
I'm not PROTESTING PROTEST.
Nor am I PROTESTING because
PROTEST is being PROTESTED.
Now that that’s clear I’ll go on and
PROTEST.

First of all I want to lash out
at Gray the man. This will be per-
sonal, so all readers not named
Grayfred Gray may skip to the
next paragraph. However, you may
read it if you want to, unless Gray-
fred Gray PROTESTS. Grayfred,
for you: I PROTEST your continual
walking around your apartment
which is situated strategically above
the Lyric theatre. I have noticed
from time to time that you persist
in doing exercises during the two

 

o'clock flick. This is a violation of
man’s inalienable right—freedom
from fear that the roof might fall
in—and as such I PROTEST. This
might also be an honor violation,
so you'd better watch out. I admit
this is stretching my PROTEST a bit,
but it is conceivable that this could
be interpreted as the “best opinion”
of the student body, as Ed Webster
calls it. And remember that this
“best opinion” comes from men
named to the E.C. because “they
are men of above-average intelli-
gence and understanding,” dutifully
chosen by their clique, and elected
by the straight party ticket. That’s
my personal PROTEST, Gray, from

me to you. Please stay still from two
to four.

Now for you conscientious readers
who skipped the last paragraph for
fear that you might have been
cheating or something, here’s a gen-
eral PROTEST that everyone might
be interested in. I PROTEST the sor-

HICKEY, SHANK, KELL TAKE TWO FIRSTS

 

W&L Trackmen Blast High Point, 104-36

Washington and Lee’s track team
roared off to a rocket start in its
opening track meet Thursday as it
blasted High Point College, 104-36.

The win was the ninth straight
dual meet victory for the Generals

over a two-year span. Last year they
compiled an 8-0 record.

The meet, which had been fig-
ured to go down to the wire,
wasn’t close after the sixth event
as W&L established a 36-18 lead.

 

Last year the Generals edged High
Point, 74-62, with a first in the
last event—the mile relay.

Captain Jim Hickey, Mike Shank,
and freshman Robin Kell paced the
Generals’ win with two firsts each.
Hickey came home first in the 100
and 220-yard dashes. His 100 time
of 0:9.8 tied the school record, but
it will not go into the book because
of a strong wind behind him. In the

| 220 Hickey turned in a good 0:23.0.

Shank, W&L’s top distance runner,
sped to wins in the mile and two
mile. In the mile he turned in a
4:49.5 performance, which was only
six seconds off his best time of last
year. The speedy sophomore led a
W&L sweep in the two-mile with a
10:48.2 time.

Kell, a freshman, tied for first
in the high jump with a leap of
5’ 8” and captured first in the hop,
step, and jump with a 40’ 9 1/2”
effort.

Washington and Lee swept three
events—the pole vault, the shot
put, and the two-mile run. Jack
Kowalski paced the shot sweep with

™ a toss of 40’ 9”. He was followed

by John Lee and George Cruger.
The day’s best effort was by Dave
Munroe, an unofficial entry, who
put the shot 42’ 3 1/2”.

Ed Myers, Jim Parker, and Spence
McEvoy finished one, two, three
in the pole vault. Meyers cleared

10’ 6” while Parker and McEvoy | a first in the 440 with a 0:53.4. Essex,

each cleared 10’.

Scoring behind Shank in the
two-mile were Stoney Duffey and
Ed Garretson, two cross-country
men.

Skip Essex, one of the team’s
most promising freshmen, lunged to

remembering a very close defeat at
VMI in winter track, pulled the
same trick on High Point’s Jack
Benge. Benge held the lead in the
race until Essex and he neared the
tape. With a last burst of speed
Essex lunged for the tape and edged
the High Point runner by an inch.

Other first place winners for W&L
were Ken Kowalski in the javelin
(166’ 1”), Preston Lancaster in the
120-yard high hurdles (0:17.0); John
Pearson in the 220-yard low hurdles
(0:27.7); Tom Edwards in the broad
jump (20’ 8”), and Hickey, Essex,
Fox Urquhart and Norm Young-
blood in the mile relay (3:52.9).

Dear Sir:

Regarding Mr. Frank Parson’s letter in
the Tuesday edition of the Ring-tum Phi,
the PiKA’s would be happy to meet the facul-
ty in a post-season handball game, and
would like to take this opportunity to polite-
ly invite the Faculty to play the PiKA’s in
football. We feel that the complaint of intra-
mural discrimination against the Faculty is
just. It certainly isn’t fair to ban a team from
competition simply because it can beat you.
We therefore hope that in the future the
Faculty will be permitted to participate in all

intramural sports. Futhermore, there are un-
doubtedly many great athletes on the Hill,
and it would benefit the students to be able
to see them in action.

The PiKA’s are aware of the invincibility
of the challengers’ handball team, and were
awed by the statistics quoted by Mr. Parsons.
However, we are willing to sacrifice ourselves
for the sake of the principle involved.

In football we may fare a little better
although the Faculty is certain to field a
fierce team. We hope that Mr. Parsons him-
self will be able to play, preferably at tackle.

Modestly yours,

OPEN WITH MARYLAND THURSDAY

 

The first English lacrosse team
ever to play in America meets
Washington and Lee University’s
stickmen here March 24, in the open-
ing contest of a seven-game schedule
for the touring British.

The English team, composed of
players from Oxford and Cambridge
Universities, will meet other top
American collegiate teams including
Virginia, Johns Hopkins, Army,
Holy Cross, Harvard, and Yale.

Washington and Lee was a logi-
cal choice for the opening game,
said General Coach Bob McHenry,
since the Lexington school’s stick-
men, along with the Virginia Ca-
valiers, have established interna-
tional reputations.

After two weeks of practice, the®
squad is beginning to round into
shape. Coach Bill Washburn so
far has been impressed with PiKA
senior Jerry Wilborn, freshman John
Baker, and several of the players
from last year’s freshman team.

The tennis team plays a tough
schedule against such big teams as
Colgate, Duke, and Virginia, but
Coach Washburn thinks that the
team can improve on its 1960 rec-
ord of 9-3.

Returning to the number one and
two net positions are Captain Bill
McWilliams and Clark Valentiner,
respectively.

Wilborn, playing with what Coach
Washburn terms “mid-season form”
in early practices, should secure
a place in the starting six.

Several players from last year’s
freshman team are trying to move
into varsity berths this year. Of
these John Mills, Andy Adelson,
Hugh Trout, Bill Smith, and Dick
Albert have shown the most prom-
ise so far.

In addition to Baker, freshmen
Jim Mell and Jud Reis have been
working with the varsity and will be
looking for positions when challenge
matches start next week.

The squad will be cut to twelve
players before spring vacation. Ten
men will travel for the six away
games. There will not be a fresh-
man team this year.

Freshmen May Give Baseball Good Bench;
‘Pretzel-Bender’ Gamber Bolsters Mound Staff

Freshmen are expected to pro-
vide much of the bench strength for
this year’s varsity baseball squad, ac-
cording to head coach Joe Lyles.
One freshman, Howard Martin, is
expected to start at first base this
year.

Other freshmen of whom the coach
thinks highly are catcher-third base-
man Ed Burdell, shortstop Barry
Greene, centerfielder Pete Candler,
utility infielder Lou Flanagan, and
catcher Stan Leydig. Flanagan and
Martin, the coach says, seem right
now to be the best hitters of the
group.

Freshmen will make up the ma-
jority of the pitching staff. Left-
hander Brice Gamber is expected
to be in the starting rotation with
upperclassmen Roy Carpenter and
Phil Sharp.

Southpaws Ed Norton and Bill
Marion, the coach says, “need help
on their balance when they throw,
and need work on the mechanics.
They'll get plenty.”

Righthander Penn Way has a

The coach feels that control is the
main thing these boys need work on.
“With games so close together,” he
says, “these boys will of necessity
see a good deal of action. I'll need

don’t have it when they pitch these

Army Announces Selections

For Graduating ROTC Men

Within the past few days the
W&L ROTC Department has re-
ceived the complete list of assign-
ments for seniors enrolled in the
Advance Course. Formerly only the
branch assignments for those peo-
ple either requesting or receiving
two year tours of active duty or
requesting delays had been officially
reported.

Captain Andreas J. Moller, the
senior ROTC instructor, reported
that 75.5 per cent of the cadets re-
ceived their first choice of branch
assignments, and 93.8 per cent re-
ceived the tour of duty length which
they preferred. Overall, 71.4 per cent
of the ROTC seniors received both
their first choice of branch and the
desired length of service.

Comparing the classes of ’60 and
61, this year’s class did much better.
Last year only 588 per cent of the

with 85.6 per cent this year. For
the two year men, of the ones which
asked for two years, 92.8 per cent
received their preference last year,
while all of this year’s seniors who
requested two years got that tour
of duty.

Seventeen members of this year’s
class requested and received delays
for further education in graduate
school or law school, a perfect 100
per cent.

Of the seven Distinguished Mili-
tary Science Students, who are elig-
ible for application for Regular
Army Commissions, only one has
applied. He is Walter Shugart, who
is temporarily assigned to two year’s
active duty in his first choice branch,
Armor.

In Lacrosse Meet Here
(Continued from page 3)

Seven lettermen returned from
last year’s squad, which posted
a 2-6-1 record, and only two
freshmen with previous lacrosse
experience reported for practice
this year.

Heading the returning lettermen
are defenseman John Dinkle, mid-
fielder Hunter Tracht, and attacker
Roy Gordon. Also back are mid-
fielder Terry Fohs, a football Little
All-American; and defensemen Bill
Wheeler, Danny Reed, and Bart
Mitchell.

Others who should see much ac-
tion include attackers Roy Miller,
Les Peard, and Jim Powers and mid-
fielders Randy Wootton, Charley
Gummey, Steve Suttle, and Bill
Spencer-Strong.

There are only 24 players on the
roster this year, but McHenry thinks
the Generals can improve their rec-
ord.

“A small squad is always a draw-
back, but it’s all right when you
have the right type of boys. And I
think we do,” McHenry said.
McHenry is also looking forward
to winning his first home lacrosse
game in his three-year span as
W&L’s coach. He thinks his best
chance will come against either
Loyola or Colgate.

The Generals, who are considered
among the nation’s top 20 lacrosse
teams, play perennial powerhouses
Maryland, Virginia, Johns Hopkins,
and Baltimore University this year.

ry print job that PROTEST gets
every week. This must result from
the typist having to copy the various
caliph’s handwriting, so I suppose
it is a minor point. Nevertheless, no
point is too minor if there is room
for PROTEST.

And now, speaking for the Amer-
ican public as well as for myself,
I want to PROTEST the fact that
there are no advertisements in PRO-
TEST. This is obviously an attempt
to undermine the nation’s economy,
and with this PROTEST I want to
call on the good old House UN-
American Activities Committee to
come down and put on one of their
TV spectaculars for us. That would
be a PROTEST with results. I think
that everyone would agree that a
few ads from McCrum’s and The
College Town Shop would liven

One final PROTEST concerning
PROTEST and I'll be through. Gray,
your paper needs one of two things
to be a complete PROTEST, and I
offer this advice as a SUGGEST:
either run a comic strip with blank
panels, or a cross-word puzzle with
all black squares. A little subtlety
like that would help out now and
then.

For example, it would be a very easy thing to teach poetry
and music right along with physics. Students, instead of merely
being called upon to recite in physics class, would instead be
required to rhyme their answers and set them to familiar tunes
—like, for instance, The Colonel Bogey March. Thus recitations
would not only be chock-full of important facts but would, at
the same time, expose the student to the aesthetic delights of
great music. Here, try it yourself. You all know The Colonel
Bogey March. Come, sing along with me:

Loves of Dobie Gillis < etc.)

 

I WAS A TEEN-AGE SLIDE RULE
In a recent learned journal (Mad) the distinguished board

Sigafoos) of one of our most

important American corporations (the Arf Mechanical Dog Co.)
wrote a trenchant article in which he pinpointed our gravest
national problem: the lack of culture among science graduates.

Mr. Sigafoos’s article, it must be emphasized, was in no sense
derogatory. He stated quite clearly that the science student,
what with his gruelling curriculum in physics, math, and chem-
istry, can hardly be expected to find time to study the arts
too. What Mr. Sigafoos deplores—indeed, what we all deplore
—is the lopsided result of today’s science courses: graduates
who can build a bridge but can’t compose a concerto, who know
Planck’s Constant but not Botticelli’s Venus, who are familiar
with Fraunhofer’s lines but not with Schiller’s.

Mr. Sigafoos can find no solution to this hideous imbalance.
I, however, believe there is one—and a very simple one. It is
this: if students of science don’t have time to come to the arts,

to students of science.

Said energy is mass.

And Pascal’s a rascal. So’s Boyle.
Do you see how much more broadening, how much more
uplifting to learn physics this way? Of course you do. What?

all means:

Leyden
He made the Leyden jar.
Trolley
He made the Trolley car.

Rode in a surrey,
And Diesel’s a weasel. So’s Boyle.

Once the student has mastered The Colonel Bogey March, he
can go on to more complicated melodies like Death and Trans-
figuration, the Eroica, and Love Me Tender.

And when the student, loaded with science and culture,
leaves the classroom and lights his Marlboro, how much more
he will enjoy that filter, that flavor, that pack or box! Because
there will no longer be an unease gnawing at his soul, no longer
a little voice within him repeating that he is culturally a colt.
He will know—know joyously—that he is a fulfilled man, 1
whole man, and he will bask and revel in the pleasure of his
Marlboro as a colt rolls in new grass—content, complete, truly
educated—a credit to his college, to himself, and to his tobac-

And while he is rolling, colt-wise, in the new grass, perhaps
he would stop long enough to try a new cigarette from the
makers of Marlboro—unfiltered, king-size Philip Mc:ris
