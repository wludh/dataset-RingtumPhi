Civil War Cc

Dr. Gaines
To Speak

By TOM RAINS
Associate Editor

A ceremony marking the opening
here in Lexington of the National
Civil War Centennial Commemora-
tion will be he'd Sunday, Jan. 8, at 2
p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Speaking on this occasion will be
former president of Washington and
Lee, Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines,
who is now chancellor of the Univer-
sity.

This ceremony is one of several
held around the country which will
mark the opening of this centennial
commemoration. Taking place at the
tomb of General Robert E. Lee, its
primary theme will be Lee’s role in
the reconciliation of the divided
country following the Civil War and
how his work here at Washington
College was a vital element in the
unity of the North and South. It is
upon this subject that Dr. Gaines
will speak.

A similar program is being held in
New York at the tomb of General
Ulysses S. Grant, in which a bat-
talion from the United States Mili-
tery Academy will participate. A
speaker will also be present there.

Dr. William G. Bean of the Wash-
ington and Lee Department of His-
tory is in charge of the ceremonial
activities; and he announced that
the entire student body is invited to
attend.

Being a member of the Civil War
Centennial Commission for Rock-
bridge County and for the state of
Virginia, Dr. Bean was appointed
to the task by Dr. George W. Deihl,
chairman of the commission and a
member of the Rockbridge Chamber
of Commerce.

Dr. Bean has announced that rep-
resentatives from the National Cen-
tennial Commission at Washington,
D.C. will be present along with ob-
servers from the Texas centennial
commission.

Also present at the ceremony will
be Mrs. Robert Bachman of Washing-
ton who is President General of the
United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy. In addition former governor of
Virginia, William Tuck will attend.

Mr. Tuck is presently a United States
Representative in Congress from
Virginia, is Vice-Chairman of the
National Civil War Centennial Com-
mission, and is an alumnus of Wash-
ington and Lee. Mr. Tuck will pay
tribute to General Grant during the
ceremony, while at the same time a
speaker at the New York ceremony
will pay similar tribute to General
Lee.

An honor guard from the Wash-
ington and Lee Corps of Cadets will
stand at the ceremony.

Dr. Bean said that he had been
advised by the headquarters of the
National Commission that the pro-
gram will be filmed by a company
from Roanoke and will be televised
at a later date. Also WREL of Lex-
ington will broadcast the ceremonial
commemoration live from Lee
Chapel, and WLVA of Lynchburg
will tape the program.

Washington and Lee Receives Texaco Scholarships
For Fifth Straight Year; Unrestricted $1,500 Given

For the fifth consecutive year,
Washington and Lee University has
been designated as a participant in
the Texaco, Inc., aid-to-education
program’s support of privately- en-
dowed colleges and universities.

President Fred C. Cole announced
the receipt of a check of $1,500 from
Texaco for unrestricted use by the
university. He said Washington and
Lee will apply the money to its
faculty salary improvement program,
as was done with other gifts from
Texaco,

“We are grateful to Texaco for
its continuing interest in Washing-
ton and Lee,” President Cole said.
“We are pleased when the work
we do merits the support of a pro-

 

gram such as that conducted by Tex-
aco, Inc., in behalf of higher edu-
cation. The company’s recognition
of the importance of privately-sup-
ported colleges and universities is
commendable and its concern for
their well-being is encouraging.
Washington and Lee will use the
grant in its program to give appro-
priate compensation to the faculty.”

The oil company’s aid-to-educa-
tion program for 1960-61 is providing
approximately $700,000 for higher
education purposes. Part represents

40-Piece Daura Art Show
On Display In duPont Hall

Paintings by Spanish-born artist
Pierre Daura were placed on ex-
hibition Thursday in Washington
and Lee University’s duPont Art
Gallery.

The one-man show marks Daura’s
first exhibition at the university.
The artist currently lives at Rock-
bridge Baths near Lexington.

Daura is the holder of the St.
Cecilia landscape prize which he
won in 1931 at Montserrat, France.

The exhibition is retrospective in
nature including Daura’s paintings,
drawings and sculpture done be-
tween 1928 and 1959. Some 40 works
are displayed. The show is under the
sponsorship of the Washington and
Lee department of fine arts.

A reception for the artist and his
wife was held in the gallery from 4
to 6 p.m. Thursday prior to the open-
ing of the exhibition.

Daura was formerly head of the
fine arts faculty at Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College for seven years un-
til his retirement in 1953.

“Pierre Daura’s work shows great

Marian Junkin, chairman of the
university’s fine arts department.

Costume Sales
Soar; Last Days
Are Jan. 10-11

The Fancy Dress costume sale has
been very successful thus far, with
about 300 costumes already ordered.

Next Tuesday and Wednesday,
Jan, 19 and 11—from 9 to 5 in the
Student Union—the Shakespeare-
an-theme costumes will again be on
sale.

Steve Galef of the sales committee
reminds those who have ordered
costumes and have not sent in the
required measurements to do so as
soon as possible. The company is
holding the shipment because of
alterations and will send the best
costumes to those first sending in
the measurements. It is to the
benefit of the purchaser to send these
statistics in now.

Today is the last day for cancel-
lations. Anyone ordering a cos-
tume and failing to cancel it and
does not pick it up will be charged
six dollars.

The costumes may be picked up
and paid for on the afternoons of
January 26 and 27 at which time
extra alterations can be made. The
costumes and receipt stubs are to
be returned on the following Mon-
day.

Mrs. Arlene Stover of Oak Hill,
Roanoke, costumers for this ball,
states that this initial costume sale
has been the best yet and indicates a
successful Fancy Dress.

States Court of Appeals of the Dis-
trict of Columbia will be the key
speaker for the 13th annual Tucker
Law Lectures at Washington and
Lee University.

Judge E. Barrett Prettyman will
speak at the university April 21 and
22, according to an announcement
made by Charles P. Light, dean of
the Washington and Lee School of
Law. He will give a series of three
lectures on the general topic of
“Some Modern Problems in Crim-
inal Law.”

Judge Prettyman, chief judge of
the Washington federal court since
1945, is a graduate of Randolph-
Macon College and the Georgetown
University Law School. He holds
B.A., LL.B., and LL.D. degrees.

The Tucker Lectures were esta-
lished at Washington and Lee in
1949 in honor of John Randolph
Tucker, the first dean of the School
of Law here and president of the
American Bar Association in 1892.
The initial lectures were delivered
by the late John W. Davis, a member
of the law class of 1895.

 

and allied subjects will be eligible
for the new scholarships if they an-
ticipate communications careers.
Grants will be limited to juniors and
seniors who meet the requirements
of the foundation. Washington and
Lee officials will nominate candidates
for the awards.

The foundation expresses a spe-
cial interest in students studying for
careers in public service writing,
editing or programming, educational
broadcasting and technical fields of
transmission and reception, accord-
ing to Kenneth E. Haefele, founda-
tion secretary.

The stipends of the scholarships
will vary according to the needs of
each successful applicant, Dr. Cole
said.

“We are pleased with this action of
the Alfred I. duPont Awards Foun-
dation in the field of radio-television
and allied sciences,” Professor O. W.
Riegel, chairman of the university's
department of journalism and com-
munications, said. “The needs were

never greater for encouragement of | the

 

 

in following a communications vo-
cation.”

“T hope all the communications
industry will call to the attention of
qualified young men the establish-
ment of these substantial scholar-
ships,” Professor Riegel added.

The duPont Foundation was es-
tablished in 1942 by Mrs. Jesse Ball
duPont in memory of her late hus-
band.

Calyx Beauty
Contest Opens

Ned Ames, editor of the 1961
Calyx, announced the opening of the
Calyx Beauty Queen Contest today.

Students are asked to give pictures
of their girls or other beauties to
Ned Ames or Ken Beall at the Delta
Tau Delta House, before Feb. 1.

The Queen will reign with a court
of four girls in the beauty section
of the 1961 yearbook.

A free case of premium beer will
be awarded to the student who sub-
mits the winning photograph. Ames
said the award is being offered as
an incentive to get more students
to participate in the contest.

The pictures must be 5 by 7 inch
glossy prints. The information
that must be included is the girl's
name, her school and hometown.

=

The Queen and her court will be
selected from the entries by a well-
known celebrity. Famous stars who
have been judges in the past few
years include Burt Lancaster, Steve |
Allen and Jack Paar.

In the long distance call to Vann,
Covington had this to say, “It de-
pends upon what the dancers
want ... we start off our first set to
feel our audience out as to what type
of music they want to hear and
dance to. Then, we adapt ourselves to
meet this style.”

Variety of Appearances

To prove his point, Covington told
Vann that in the past few months
the orchestra played debutante balls
and other society affairs, high school
and college dances, a month-long
engagement at New York’s Hotel
Roosevelt Grille ‘and other engage-
ments throughout the country.

Covington added, “We feel, when
we play an engagement, that we have
an obligation to make the evening as
pleasant and entertaining as possible
for our guests. And the only way
we can do this is by giving our
guests the music they want to dance
io

Other Entertainment

Other entertainment is also sched-
uled for the gala weekend. Friday
afternoon The Brothers Four will
entertain at a cocktail party given
by the Phi Gamma Deltas in honor
of set president Don Partington.

The Saturday afternoon concert
for 1961 Fancy Dress will feature the
popular Dukes of Dixieland, who ap-
peared here at Springs two years
ago.

Fifty-Second Ball

This will be the 52nd Fancy Dress
Ball for W&L. The Dorsey Brothers;
Buddy Morrow, Louis Armstrong
and many other top entertainers
have participated in the Weekend in
recent years. The 1960 dance set
featured Lester Lanin and Lionel
Hampton.

Lanin played for the Ball, which
had as its theme “The Evolution of

 

Warren Covington

Man.” Lionel Hampton entertained
with a Saturday concert and at the
Saturday night dance.

This year the theme for the Ball
is “Shakespeare in the Court of St.

James” and promises to be a revival
of the old spirit of Fancy Dress
Balls.

Besides their dance engagements,
Warren Covington and the Tommy
Dorsey Orchestra have made several
long playing albums for Decca Rec-
ords. Numbered among the releases
are “The Fabulous Arrangements of
Tommy Dorsey In Hi-Fi,” “Tea for
Two Cha-Cha” (the single sold over
one million copies) “Dance and Ro-
mance,” “The Swinging Era,” and
“More Tea for Two Cha-Chas.”

‘PROGRESS’ IS AN EVASIVE

Che KRing-tum Phi
WORD

 

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

New Year’ s Resolutions Are Proposed
The Idea Of This University

We have readily endorsed “academic excellence,” as we
have coined it, on the Washington and Lee campus, and have
praised the seemingly new horizons in education to which we
appear to be striving. These endorsements and praises are shal-
low, however, and even more important, our understanding of
the phrases to which they apply is lacking. We pay lip service
to such high sounding concepts, often for the sake of rhetoric,
with the purpose of assuring ourselves that the blend of edu-
cation we are receiving is sufficient.

For the moment, forgetting dance plans and jazz weekends,
campus politics and the occasional trivia that often occupies
our attention, we propose a sincere appraisal of the educational
merit offered by the curriculum of this liberal arts college.

Insofar as the graduate of most modern universities, such
as ours, has collected an appreciable number of facts and de-
veloped and somewhat polished his ability to understand, eval-
uate and act, he is considered educated by the current stand-
ards. A liberal arts institution, however, should not altogether
be concerned with this wholesale distribution of facts.

Although it is indeed important that a student know the
content of the so-called fundamentals of his courses (history,
English literature, political science and all the rest), this should
be just the beginning. The importance is in the derivation of
these facts and ideas and what influences, mental or physical,
led to their inception. It is through an examination and study
of these evolving influences that we can trace the dominant |
motifs of human thought in general as they change through
the years, or their culmination perhaps in our own thinking.
A knowledge of this transition of thought, but more important,
a consideration of its origins, will lead us to a better understand-
ing of our culture, for every important institution in our so-
ciety originated through a similiar progression of thought.

Consider the following example: it may be argued that
there are several contemporary beliefs pertaining to civil rights.
We can trace much current thought back to institutions or
ideals such as the Bill of Rights and the Emancipation Procla-

 

their dates, etc., but we hold that Lincoln, as well as those ap-
praising such issues, were influenced by preconceived notions
of justice. Such notions are a part of the very core of our
thinking process, as they were in the nineteenth century, or
before, with those whose ideals forged the institutions of our
society.

We might discover that these notions were a result of many
influences upon the minds of past generations of Americans.
Perhaps a developing Judaic-Christian tradition of justice and
love, political expediences resulting from prior situations,
and influences with economic or social implications were these
preconceived credos or influences that tend to form the sub-
stance of the important events of that time.

These common beliefs can be abstracted even more to
include patterns of thought containing absolute requirements
for behavior—an example of this would possibly be man’s
basic association with a supreme being and the ramifications
of this relationship. The carry over of these notions into our
thought today will assure that any resolve that is reached,
whether it be gradual or immediate, as regards a controversy
like civil rights, will be a result of our own patterned way of
thinking.

A study, or rather, a search for these preconceived and de-
veloping patterns of thought will better enable us to appraise our
way of life, and if we find the notions archaic, disregard and
replace them, if lacking or vague, reconstruct them, or if sound,
adopt them as a foundation for action.

It is not important, therefore, that we attempt to re-apply
former concepts or decisions, but that we understand the under-
tones that confront us with a prior knowledge of these uni-
versally held and accepted notions. A survey course, which is
the blight of American education, unfortunately does not af-
ford a student the opportunity for the search that we propose.
Unless we attempt to fortify the institutions in our society, such
as free enterprise or our individual liberties, the church or
the university, by wholly understanding them, it is possible that
they will become impotent. Away with surface-scratching let’s

 

 

mation. Anyone can memorize the content of these treatises,

penetrate!

We are not altogether condemning Washington and Lee’s
method of teaching. A great part of an education is the indi-
vidual’s responsibility—private research and outside reading
for example. But a deficiency still is present in the educational
complex here that should be relieved. Unconsciously, or often
purposely, professors explore these areas of thought to which
we refer, yet this is not the rule. Rather than the mere doling
out of facts and principles, our curriculum should be vitalized
to include the exploration for the connections of thought, the
permanent ideals, the preconceived notions that lie behind the
inception of a principle or fact. This university is not alone in
its tendency to leave this area unexplored, however, for many
institutions are guilty of the neglect.

We recommend the following proposals for consideration
by the administration and the faculty:

1) The establishment of a committee composed of depart-
ment heads and representatives of the administration
which will evaluate the content of the courses offered in
undergraduate liberal arts and vitalize them to include a

goal of deeper penetration in the system of instruction.

The establishment of a new course of study similar to the
Special Programs Study at Princeton whose purpose is
“to introduce the student to the civilization of his own
day through a many-sided understanding of the major
movements of Western culture which have formed it, and
to train him to judge ideas, relating his own thinking to
an understanding of the historical background of our
civilization.”” This Great Ideas or Ideals course should
be limited to men of junior standing or above, and it should
be a required course of every major in liberal arts.

2)

Of our tradition we should be justly proud, but at the same
time we should check any drift in our academic standards to
traditionism. Educational requirements are not static. They
must evolve in the changing atmosphere of our time. It would
be difficult for a graduate with a Victorian background to
treat with wisdom the problems of this age.

A Revised Grading System Urged

A student recently defined Washington and Lee Univer-
sity as a fine school using 20th century ideas of education, but
as a school using a 19th century grading system.

We are the first to hail the ‘new era.” We feel that Wash-
ington and Lee has long awaited a new era, as this publication
has termed the forward and progressive attitude adopted here
during the last few years, and we are overjoyed to see W&L
climb in the ranks of the leading colleges across the country.

Simply because a situation exists does not make it correct.
For this reason we of this paper support, and will continue to
support, a change in the archaic and what we feel is an unfair
grading system that this university employs.

No less than three editorials and columns have appeared
on this page of the Ring-tum Phi within the last two years, all
calling for a change in the system of grading.

Perhaps those in authority have read, and have considered
change, but they have not, to our way of thinking, properly
appraised this situation, nor have they taken any definite stand
publicily other than avoiding the issue entirely.

As has been pointed out in the preceding pleas, the present
system is unfair. It is unfair because it cuts the student’s incen-
tive down to an almost negligible position. It is unfair because
a student under the present system can have an average of
70, and, on the other hand, a student having an 82 average,
will both, more than likely, receive the grade of “‘C” in the
course. From observation of the 12 point span between 70 and
82, one can easily that see the present system is out of date, and
that it is not in keeping with 20th century education.

The grade of “C plus,” we therefore assert, should be in- |

Ocassionally there is a slant of light
in the muck of unconcern for free-
doms and rights, an example being

universities across the nation reveals that Wé&L is in a definite
minority because it does not utilize the “plus” system of grad-
ing. (See box scores in center column.)

In this age of specialization, the increasing tendency being
adopted by employers is simply to place a tremendous empha-
sis on the graduate’s grades that he has accumulated during
his college years. For this reason, we emphasize a revision in
the grading system, a revision that would fairly and accurately
represent the student’s work.

When commencement is over and Washington and Lee
graduates start looking for jobs, here is where the grade re-
ceived in college means the most. For this reason, we believe that
the man with the 82 “C” is getting the small end of the deal,
and for this reason, we term the present system unfair.

Those who would maintain that the grade isn’t essentially
important are only avoiding the issue and are not considering
the problem objectively. Our aim in once again presenting the
issue is in hopes that the faculty and the administration will
take an objective stand, and that they will publicly announce
that stand.

We feel that if W&L is to have top-notch men represented
in all fields in the future—medicine, the arts, law, journalism, en-
gineering, and in all the liberal arts fields—then the grading
system must be changed to keep pace with the new era.

Calling for revision and for suggestions in a revamping of
the present grading system is the purpose of this editorial. It
is our sincere hope that this plea will not, as has been the fate of
the other requests for change, go unnoticed and unheeded.

deadly Moccasins.

The 8 p.m. contest is the first of
three straight home games for the

night they play host to Bridgewater,
which downed the Generals, 57-50, in
their season’s opener.

Tomorrow’s opponent, Chatta-
nooga, is “big and subsidized,”
according to W&L Coach Bob Mc-
Henry.

“They have the same team back
this year that beat us by 11 points

 

John Kirk
... Starts Scoring Play

 

last year,’ McHenry said. “Satur-
day’s game will be a tough battle.”
Although Chattanooga is a small
school, it plays some big-time op-
ponents. In the Moccasins most re-
cent clash with a large school, they
lost to Vanderbilt, a Southeastern
Conference powerhouse, by 14 points.

Thackston Leads Scoring

The Generals go into tomorrow’s
game with two men scoring in
double figures. Guard Brett Thacks-
ton and forward Ken Kowalski boast
14.5 and 10.7 averages respectively.

Bip Fauber sports a 9.4 mark
while center John McDowell has a
6.2 average.

Thackston has scored the most
field goals with 48, 11 more than
second-place Kowalski, and has
made the most free throws with
20 out of 26—a 76.9 percentage.

Fauber has hit 19 of 26 charity
tosses for a 73.1 percentage while
the remainder of the squad is aver-
aging around 50 per cent from the
free throw line.

In the rebounding department,
Fauber has a commanding lead with
a 16.5 average. McDowell is second
with a 10.1 mark.

In team statistics, Washington
and Lee is averaging 54.9 points
per game while its opponents are
getting 63.7 points. The difference

 

has been at the free throw line,
Washington and Lee’s early season
bugaboo.

W&L has made 73 of 130 free
throws—a 56.1 percentage; but the
Generals’ opponents have connected

on 120 of 188 free throws for a 65.1
percentage.

Despite their lack of height, the
Generals hold a slight lead over
their opponents in the rebounding
department. For eight games the

 

THREE-HAND TOUCH—McDowell, Rutledge fight for rebound.

First Meet

In 2 Years

As West Virginia Captures 56-39 Win

Well, it took the General tankmen
almost two years to meet defeat,
but Coach Eastman and his boys
now know of Lexington’s most com-
mon feeling during the winter sea-
son. Subsidization and a powerful
band of Mountaineers from West

only three first places. Co-captain
Jim Parker placed first in the

F&M Nips Generals, 60-56

Free throws deprived the Gener-
als of a victory for the third time
this season when Franklin and Mar-
shall tripped them, 60-56, December
16.

Washington and Lee grabbed a
32-22 lead at halftime, but saw the
victory slowly swish away as Frank-
lin and Marshall sank 18 of 20 free
throws in the second half while
W&L made only two of four.

Thackston, Kowalski, John Kirk,
and Fauber combined to give the
Generals their halftime lead, but
only Thackston continued to find
the range from the floor in the
second half. The 5-9 guard ended
up with 21 points, which equalled
the best scoring performance by
Washington and Lee player this
season, |

In the first game the Generals’ |
two-game, pre-Christmas northern |

Again the Generals had a good

vicious invasions of academic free-
dom which has aroused the students.

Has Made Film

The Committee, whose actions are
oftentimes dubious enough, has put
together a film called Operation Ab-
olition which may be obtained from
a commercial film company for $100
and has been shown to some Federal
Agencies and colleges. The film de-
velops the theme that the students
were naughty and non-thinking and
are now disheartened and ashamed
after the episode which was the
demonstration in San Francisco. As
if this were not enough, they also
state that the demonstration was
Communist instigated, and the FBI
concurs in this opinion!

These are serious charges. Is
this the price for a political com-
ing-of-age? Many persons have
come out against the Committee
and against this film for the fright-
ening ability to defame by mass
communications the right to be
concerned and to raise questions,

The sit-in demonstrations are an-
other area where student involv-
ment is on the increase. Many stu-
dents have proved their willingness
to stand up and act for what they
regard as important. Nor does the
opposition always come from those
with opposite views, racists if you
will. People with “good judgment,”
those with a social conscience who
profess to believe in the equalities
spelled out by the 14th amendment
have been equally to blame.

 

40 Piece Daura Art Show
On Display in duPont Hall

(Continued from page 1)

Sixty-four-year-old Daura was
born in Barcelona, Spain, where he
studied at the Fine Arts School. In
1913, he went to Paris and continued
his studies under Emile Bernard.
In 1928, he married the former
Louise Blair of Richmond, Va. They
moved to Saint Cirq-laPopie, Lot,
France, where the artist still main-
tains a summer home.

During 1936 and 1937, Daura fought
for the Loyalist Army in the Spanish
Civil War. A year later he moved
his family to Rockbridge Baths. He
conducted art classes in Lexington
from 1943 to 1945 when he moved
to Lynchburg.

Naturalized in 1943, Daura has par-
ticipated in group shows in Belgium,
Holland, Spain and the United
States. He has held one-man shows
in France, Australia and Argentina.

His work has been shown at the
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Yale
University, Hollins College, Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman’s College and
the Lynchburg and Roanoke Fine
Arts Centers.

Serve as Example

The previously mentioned female
students serve as a concrete ex-
ample. These girls acted on their
own initiative and because of per-
sonal beliefs in the necessity for
action and encouragement of inte-
gration. They did not go up to the
lunch counter without knowledge
of the possible consequences. They
doubtless knew of the local law
which has been passed to deal with
this sort of thing by accusing those
sit-in demonstrators of trespassing.

In October of 1960 a Sophie New-
comb sophomore on a full scholar-
ship was taken to police headquart-
ers for questioning after she had
participated in a sit-in in her own
town of New Orleans. The police
asked her why she wanted to do
such a thing, she, a southern girl.
The college, “while disapproving of
(her) actions, has supported her
right to express personal beliefs.”

The girls at the neighboring in-
stitution have not been so fortu-
nate. The President of the school.
has criticized their action in a
school assembly and they are on
some sort of probation which is
similar to our conduct probation,
if I am not mistaken. The school
paper has written a blistering edi-
torial pointing out that they broke
a law to show their “disapproval of
existing laws,” and in Motherly
fashion chided them for being so
rash.

The fact remains that the local
law has not been tested. By getting
that law into the courts action may
be started to either overrule or up-
hold this narrow, fear-based local
law. Until the law is contested it
shall stand. Some might not feel
that the time was propitious to

With Krupa

After the war, Covington joined
Les Brown’s Band and then played
gor Gene Krupa’s band. Wanting to
settle down in the city, Covington
joined the Columbia Broadcasting
System’s musical staff. From 1946
until 1956 he played such popular
shows as Arthur Godfrey’s, Perry
Como’s, Ed Sullivan’s, and Robert Q.
Lewis.

In 1956 Covington left CBS to ac-
cept the leadership of Decca Rec-
ords young band, The Commanders.
From here, after Tommy Dorsey
passed away, Covington took over the
Tommy Dorsey Orchestra.

raise the issue but they should un-
derstand the basic rights for indi-
vidual concern which are involved.

The heartening aspect in the afore-
mentioned events is that students
are becoming concerned. They are
developing a political consciousness
contra opinions of middle aged sages
who have attempted to psychoanalyze
a whole generation. When people
can think outside themselves and
seek to strengthen the freedoms of
equality, press, assembly and speech
it is a wonderful thing. Winston
Churchill has said of democracy that
“it is the worst form of government
save for all the others.” Such stu-
dent concern for our democracy
and its betterment is to be admired
and furthered.

folding chairs in Doremus Gymna-
sium? This was a moment which
was destined to be recalled in the
hearts of W&L men long after
undergraduate days have been for-
gotten. What can match the emo-
tional impact of seeing those chairs,
each one poetically inscribed with
W&L, gleaming on a newly polish-
ed floor, as that scratchy beat-up,
79 rpm antique pealed out the
lovely notes of Pomp and Circum-
stance while the faculty cha-cha-
ed to their seats?

And what about the new side-
walks? They are truly lovely, and as
the rain calmly gurgles down them
at night, filling your shoes and
making your stroll excitingly danger-
ous, who can deny that progress is
not truly wonderful?

Then there is the motorized vacu-
um cleaner, which first made its ap-

1960. The year was definitely more
beneficial to all concerned because
of its presence.

The sight of one of those bags
of leaves falling off, spilling its
contents all over the campus, to
be captured again by the rakers on
foot, was a thrilling experience.
Can we dare to hope for its recur-
rence next fall?

Craven Reviews Year’s Events

That Were Outstanding For W&L

But the most inspiring change
brought to Washington and Lee
during 1960 rightfully occurred with-
in the hallowed walls of McCormick
Library. I’m speaking of the new
lights which joyfully drone and hiss
about progress in academia, and
which have brought sleep to count-
less insomniacs among the student
body. I’m at a loss for words when
I try to recall the first time I peace-
fully dozed in the drowsing room,
lulled to sleep by the lights which
drown out all conversation.

I’m so choked up by the changes
that have occurred in 1960 that I
can only thank the University for
seeing fit to make this progress, and
for making 1960 a better year in
which to live.

1961: YEAR OF DECISION

Well sir, here we are in 1961, which shows every sign of being
quite a distinguished year. First off, it is the only year since
1951 which begins and ends with the Figure 1. Of course, when
it comes to Figure 1’s, 1961, though distinguished, can hardly
compare with 1911, which, most people agree, had not just two,
but three Figure 1’s! This, I’ll wager, is a record that will stand
for at least two hundred years!

1911 was, incidentally, notable for many other things. It
was, for example, the year in which the New York Giants played
the Philadelphia Athletics in the World Series. As we all know,
the New York Giants have since moved to San Francisco and
the Philadelphia Athletics to Kansas City. There isa movement
afoot at present to move Chicago to Phoenix—the city, not the
baseball team. Phoenix, in turn, would of course move to
Chicago. It is felt that the change would be broadening for
residents of both cities. Many Chicago folks, for example, have
never seen an iguana. Many Phoenix folks, on the other hand,
have never seen a frostbite.

There are, of course, certain difficulties attending a municipal
shift of this size. For instance, to move Chicago you also have
to move Lake Michigan. This, in itself, presents no great prob-
lem, what with modern scientific advances like electronics and
the French cuff. But if you will look at your map, you will find
that Lake Michigan is connected to all the other Great Lakes,
which in turn are connected to the St. Lawrence Seaway, which

      

\

Mer Westley Qua?
ead

in turn is connected to the Atlantic Ocean. You start dragging
Lake Michigan to Phoenix and, willy-nilly, you’ll be dragging
all that other stuff too. This would make our British allies
terribly cross, and I can’t say as I blame them. I mean, put
yourself in their place. What if, for example, you were a British
workingman who had been saving and scrimping all year for a
summer holiday at Brighton Beach, and then when you got to
Brighton Beach there wasn’t any ocean? There you'd be with your
tnner tube and snorkel and nothing to do all day but dance the
Lambeth Walk. This, you may be sure, would not make you
NATO-minded!

I appeal most earnestly to the residents of Chicago and
Phoenix to reconsider. I know it’s no bowl of cherries going
through life without ever seeing an iguana or a frostbite, but I
ask you—Chicagoans, Phoenicians—is it too big a price to pay
for preserving the unity of the free world? I am sure that if
you search your hearts you will make the right decision, for
all of us— whether we live in frostbitten Chicago, iguana-ridden
Phoenix, or narrow-lapelled New Haven—are first and foremost
Americans!

But I digress. We were speaking of 1961, our new year. And
new it is! There is, for one thing, new pleasure in Marlboro
Cigarettes. How can there be new pleasure in Marlboros when
that fine, flavorful blend, that clean easy draw filter, have not
been altered? The answer is simple: each time you light a
Marlboro, it is like the first time. The flavor is such that age
cannot wither nor custom stale. Marlboro never palls, never
jades, never dwindles into dull routine. Each pack, each
cigarette, each puff, makes you glad all over again that you are
a Marlboro smoker!

“a7

So, Marlboros in hand, let us march confidently into 1961.
May good fortune attend our ventures! May happiness reign!
May Chicago and Phoenix soon recover from their disappoint-

ment and join our bright cavalcade into a brave tomorrow!
