Dr. William A. Jenks
Recipient of Fellowship

Research Study Grant

The Social Science Research Coun-
cil has given a Washington and Lee
University professor a $6,000 grant
for a year’s study in Austria.

Dr. William A. Jenks was named
by the New York Organization as
the recipient of its maximum grant
under the group’s research fellow-
ship program. Dr. Jenks will do
the major portion of his research in
Vienna.

The Washington and Lee Board of
Trustees in a recent meeting ap-
proved the 43-year-old professor’s
leave of absence from the faculty
beginning in September. He will re-
turn to teaching here in September,
1962.

The grant was awarded to Dr.
Jenks for his proposal to initiate an
independent study of the operation
of parliamentary democracy in Aus-
tria from 1907 to 1914. Most of his
work in Vienna for the coming year
will be concerned with a detailed
appraisal of the effects of the elec-
torial reform of 1905-1907 upon the
last years of the Austrian half of
the Habsburg Monarchy. This ma-
terial will serve as a basis for the
long-range parliamentary study.

Dr. Jenks is the author of two
books on Austrian government en-
titled The Austrian Electorial Re-
form of 1907 (published in 1950) and
Vienna and the Young Hitler (pub-
lished in 1960).

The Social Science Research
Council is a national organization
composed of seven learned societies.

A member of the Washington and
Lee faculty since 1946, Dr. Jenks re-
ceived his B.A. degree from the uni-
versity in 1939. He obtained his M.A.
and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia
University in 1940 and 1949 respec-
tively. A native of Jacksonville,
Fla., he is a member of P.B.K.

From 1942 to 1945, Dr. Jenks served
in the Army-Air Force and the Of-
fice of Strategic Services. In 1954-55,
he studied in Austria under the aus-
pices of the Fund for the Advance-
ment of Education and the Fulbright
program.

Wife Of Artist Will
Discuss Medieval Art
Here On Wednesday

The wife of an artist who is cur-
rently exhibiting his work in the
duPont Art Gallery on the Washing-
ton and Lee University campus will
lecture at the university Wednes-
day on medieval art.

Mrs. Louise Blair Daura, wife of
Spanish-born artist Pierre Daura
of nearby Rockbridge Baths, will
center her 8 p.m. talk around the
theme, “A Medieval Pilgrimage.”
She will appear in duPont Auditor-
ium under the auspices of the uni-
versity’s department of fine arts.

A native of Richmond, Mrs. Daura
plans to discuss what the pilgrim
of medieval days—who made the
great pilgrimages to Rome and Jeru-
salem—would have seen had he
journeyed to Santiago de Com-
postella in her husband’s native
Spain. Her lecture will include ex-
amples of the interchange of influ-
ence of French and Spanish trends
in art and architecture.

Mrs. Daura’s lecture comes in the
fourth week of her husband’s exhi-
bition of painting and sculpture he
has done since 1928.

The artist’s wife is a graduate of
Bryn Mawr College and she has
studied at the University of Vienna
and Aillience Francaise in Paris.

“My friends at Hollins College and
other places have told me of Mrs.
Daura’s lectures and how fascinating
they are,” Dr. Marion Junkin, chair-
man of Washington and Lee’s depart-
ment of fine arts said. “Anyone in-
terested in Medieval art should be
sure to hear her.”

Pierre Daura’s exhibition, his first
at the university, opened January
5. More than 1,200 persons have
visited the gallery to see the 75
works on display. The exhibition is
scheduled to be taken down Feb-
ruary 11, after being held over one
week by popular request.

“The Daura show has been the most
popular and the most sucecssful ex-
hibition—from the standpoint of at-
tendance and sales—in the history of
' duPont Gallery,” Dr. Junkin said.

 

 

The Dukes of Dixieland will play at the Saturday afternoon concert from 3-5 p.m.

Welcome To

The Friday Staff of the Ring-tum Phi wishes to extend to
all of you a sincere welcome to the 52nd annual Fancy Dress
Ball. We are glad you were able to come to Washington and
Lee for this occasion and we hope you find it to be a pleasant

weekend.

We are especially proud of Fancy Dress. It has done much

to put W&L on the collegiate

half-century long history of the Fancy Dress Ball at least two
magazines and two radio networks have given the Ball coverage.
And the New York Times once labeled Fancy Dress as “The

South’s outstanding collegiate social event.”

Fancy Dress weekend is a

alumni of the University. From the crowds that gather at the
dances the number of strangers that “‘pad-out”’ in the fraternity
houses, we are inclined to say FD is as big attraction as Home-
comings or a Mock Convention.

So we welcome you to the Ball. To the girls from all over
the country who have traveled to Lexington to relieve the bore-
dom of mid-winter and the depression that invariably follows
exams we say welcome. To the students from Harvard, UNC,
neighboring VMI and the University of Florida we say wel-
come. And especially to our friends from that school across the
mountain we say welcome; just remember we will see you at
Mid-Winters in a couple of weeks.

Rules Laid For F-D Gurls:
Smoke, Drink, And Cuss

By THORNS CRAVEN
Friday Columnist

Now that the appetizer has been
disposed of, most of us are by this
time half way through the main
course. Credit
should be given to
the University for
scheduling exams
just before Fancy
Dress the way
they do. It sure
gives us a chance
to keep things in
their proper per-
spective, and not
go overboard buy-
ing booze for two
weeks before
things get started.

And since this issue of the paper
is coming out at a pretty inoppor-
tune time, I’m going to switch my
message to another audience. Since
few students will be able to read
this, and the few able won't any-
way, I’m going to address my remarks
this week to the people who will
read them—the first-time-at-W&L-
and/or-Fancy Dress-Girl.

   

Craven

Well, girls, you’ve survived the
cocktail party, and that means that
you're off to a good start. But don’t
think that you’re a success yet.
You’ve got two days to go, and
for the uninitiated that could mean
two days filled with faux pas after
faux pas. For your help, then, I’ve
compiled a little list of Fancy Dress
Ground Rules. Heed them closely
and you'll be invited back again
and again. Disregard them and you'll
talk to the house mother for hours
on end.

I. Drink and smoke at all times.
This must be done with skill, how-
ever, for nothing is worse than a
sloppy drinking smoker, unless it’s
a sloppy smoking drinker. To do
both skillfully requires that you
hold drink and pipe in one hand,
leaving the other free for another
drink and a cigar or something
cute.

2. Use an occasional profane word.
This again must be done skillfully,
with a logical succession of words.
For example, never say “Go to damn
hell,” say “Damn, go to hell.”

3. Don’t play “do-you-know” with
your date’s fraternity brothers.
Naturally they know, and they as-
sume that you know they know.
Hence you should assume that they
know and you know they know.
Therefore, you know, they know,
ergo, play not.

4. Be bored with crowds. Above
all, don’t get excited unless he does.
Let him think that these sort of
things go on all the time at Miss
Pinkingham’s Jr. College for Finish-
ing Girls, and that you thought W&L
would be different.

5. At the concert remember that
the Dukes of Dixieland are pleasant,
but not authentic. Smile, but don’t
pat your feet. And don’t sing the
words to “When the Saints Go
Marchin’ In.”

6. As you go from house to house,
carry your date’s drink. He will
get in trouble if caught, and all
you'll get is a smile.

 

7. Avoid walking on campus side-
walks unless you can ski. Campus
tradition dictates that snow should
be packed firmly instead of being
removed, then covered with water
in order to make a good slick sur-
face for sliding to class and injur-
ing tourists.

8. Don’t laugh at jokes in the
Southern Collegian. Comment on
how inane, passe, and ridiculous the
cartoons are. Besides that they all
come from back issues. This is im-
portant. Make some clever disparag-
ing remarks and you're sure to|
score. |

9. Comment on what asses the boys
from other schools are whenever you
have the chance. Use concrete ex-
amples by pointing to fights, passed-
out drunks, ete. This will rate you
highly.

10. Finally, keep quiet on Sunday.
It isn’t that your conversation isn’t |
wanted, it just isn’t appreciated.
Keep still, drink your tomato juice,
eat your scrambled eggs, and read
the funnies to yourself.

| Times labeled the Ball the “South’s

 

That should do it. The above are
really helpful hints, and if you abide

by them you should be a success. |

Unless you’re a flop to begin with.

Then even the rules can’t help.
But I trust there aren’t any flops |
who made it past the cocktail party,| ing for the banning of this movie

so have a good time girls. The
W&L gentleman will prevail.

W&L’s Fancy Dress 52 Years Old;
School Librarian Was Its Founder

By GEORGE HONTS

Managing Editor
Once a year this quiet little town
known as Lexington comes alive
with activity as students from all
over the country converge on it for
the “outstanding social event of the
year in the South’—the Washington

and Lee Fancy Dress Ball.

This year’s trip to the Court of
St. James marks the 52nd occurance
of the Fancy Dress Ball.

Our files tell us that the Fancy
Dress Ball was born in boredom
back in 1907. The school librarian
then, Miss Annie Jo White, decided |
to give a costume party to relieve
the boredom of Lexington winters.
She should see this one.

Miss White gave the original call |
that has been echoed every year;
since then, except one, when she.
was “disappointed by the lack of|
student response.”

By 1909 a weaker character would
have given in and stopped trying to
present a Ball, which, from the ac-
counts we gather, wasn’t really much
of a ball at all. But she stuck with
it.

 

In 1916 the Ball was moved from |
the old skating rink to that great}
edifice known as Doremus Gymna-
sium and the Ball took on more
character. It improved in popularity
too.

Our heroine, to whom we are
grateful for this occasion, turned over
the management of the Fancy Dress
Ball to the students in 1920. Miss
White said the affair was getting too
big for her to handle.

The Roarin’ Twenties was a great
decade for W&L. In 1924 John Davis
ran, and lost to Coolidge, for the
presidency. That was the year the
Mock Convention took on real
status, too, because it took a long
shot and nominated Davis.

But the crowning achievement,
social-wise anyway, of the decade
was the 1928 Fancy Dress Ball. One
thousand persons squeezed on to
the dance floor to do the Charles-
ton and four hundred more (prob-
ably wall-flowers) watched from
the sidelines.

It was in 1928 that the New York

 

most outstanding collegiate social
event.”

From then on the Ball rose in fame,
following the great American tradi-
tion of getting bigger and bigger,
better and better, and offering more
and more.

Back in 1932 “A Garden Fete at
Mount Vernon” was offered as a
celebration of the 200th anniversary
of George Washington’s birth. Mrs.
L. J. Desha, wife of W&L’s chemis-
try professor emeritus, presented the
honors that year and declared that
only the Mardi Gras (of New Orleans)
was a greater spectacle than the
Fancy Dress Ball.

The great bands of the day swung
out in the ’30’s. Eddie Duchin, Jan

 

Garber, Bernie Cummings were

duct the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra at tonight’s gala event.

among the favorites that played here.

The swingingest Ball of the mod-
ern era was in 1958. Look Magazine
reporters and photographers cov-
ered the dance while NBC’s Mon-
itor tuned in on a nationwide hook-
up. Buddy Morrow and the Am-
bassador of Good Will, Louis
‘Sachmo’ Armstrong made _ the
weekend complete.

1938—Miss Annie White, who had
not missed a Ball in the 31 years
since she created it, was chosen
Queen of Fancy Dress. And Life
Magazine did a three-page cover on
the dance.

In 1940, as the nation hung on the
edge of tragedy, Fancy Dress grew '

 

to maturity. CBS carried the festivi-'

 

ties coast to coast as the students
danced to the theme of the original
running of the Kentucky Derby.
Much to the delight of several visit-
ing Derby dignitaries, Kay Keyser
belted out “My old Kentucky Home.”

In the twenty years since then the
Fancy Dress Ball has not lost one
iota of popularity. Top name bands
still are attracted to the affiar, and
one of the school’s most cherished
honors is to be president of Fancy
Dress.

So Fancy Dress Ball progresses into
its second half-century of existence.
It’s hard to predict that the social
life of colleges in 2007 will be like.
But we'll bet that, if dances still
exist, the ‘07 FD Ball will be one
Miss Annie White could be proud of.

 

Film, The Wild One, Banned In England: To Be Here Shortly;
Ketcham Looks At Problem Of Censorship In Motion Pictures

By ROBERT C. KETCHAM
Friday Columnist

It is interesting to note that Eng-
land has a National Board which
is set up to review films before they
are shown. However, there is only one
instance of a film being refused per-
mission. That film, interestingly
enough, will be in Lexington within
the week. The Wild One with Mar-

was thet it could stimulate the
Teddy Boys and other delinquents

 

to carry out a similar feat. The Eng-
lish have a definite problem with
this sort of thing and I believe their
reasoning was valid.

Our founding fathers were deter-
mined that expression should be
unfettered by any official regula-
tion. It is significant that that free-
dom was established as a fundamen-
tal law in the First Amendment to
the Constitution. If they did not mean
expression to be absolutely free
they at least meant to give it the
largest freedom that could reason-

 

ably be achieved.

If it was to be punishable it was
by a due process trial as set out
in the Near decision, “It is no long-
er open to doubt that the liberty
of the press, and of speech, is with-
in the liberty safeguarded by the
due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment from invasion by state
action.”

In the early history of the film
as a media the Supreme Court dif-
ferentiated it from other forms of
communication. When any fledgling

 

Jon McLin Travels To Spain On Vacation;
Considers Points Of Interest And Politics

By JON McLIN
In Oxford

“The only way to cure a wanderlust
is to wander.” Carroll Cloar

The arrival of Christmas vacation
at Oxford—which began on Decem-
ber 3—found many students with a
wanderlust, and almost as many
trying the above cure for it. Foreign
students—and we Americans es-
pecially—take advantage of the prox-
imity of the Continent during the
long British vacations, which last
six weeks each Christmas and Easter
and 3% months in the summer.

For most British students vaca-
tions are not so welcome, because
for them it is a time to return to
homes where they enjoy less freedom
than at Oxford and to do—perhaps
for the first time—some serious
work, academic and/or commercial.

The range of vacation travels of
American Oxonians is almost un-
limited. As one of them said, “The
best thing about Oxford is those trips
to the continent.” During the “short”
vacations few get further afield than
Germany or northern Italy; never-
theless, some sun-chasers venture as
far as Rome, Greece, or Spanish
Morocco.

During the longer summer vaca-
tion, wider vistas open. More and
more visits have been made to Rus-
sia recently—Peter Dawkins, for in-
stance, made the trip last summer—
and trips to Africa are being talked

 

about more and more. The latter

are in keeping with what has been
called “African Year” at Oxford by
one of the student pundits, as a re-
sult of the tremendous interest shown
in Africa in a hundred or more ways.
A smaller number of students are
beginning now the attempts to get
| the necessary visas from the coun-
tries of Eastern Europe in order to
travel there during the summer.
Additional possibilities are made
aveilable through the equivalents of
the National Union of Students in

 

|
; student hostels, where room and
board are quite cheap, organized
tours, study courses, and reduced
travel rates to students of any coun-
try who produce the necessary NUS
card. Examples of the services pro-
vided are language courses in Stras-
bourg and Munich where room,
board, and tuition in French and/or
German is provided for 10 weeks
for about $200.

Among the most popular vacation
spots this Christmas were ski resorts
in Switzerland and Austria, where
ski enthusiasts enjoyed the rare
combination of good weather, good
skiing conditions, lively night life,
and low prices. Among the various
ski parties from Oxford were several
which provided transportation, room
and board and tuition for two weeks
for about $100.

Many others, including me, ven-
tured to Spain in search of the warm
sun, which will be conspicuously ab-

sent from Oxford this winter. The
consensus is that we were well re-
warded for the distance we had to
travel.

First stop on my Spanish itinerary,
after brief stays in London and Paris
en route, was Barcelona, the largest
city in Spain and the largest on the
Mediterranean. It was a happy choice,
as it turned out, because the western,
not-thoroughly-Spanish atmosphere
of Barcelona provided an easy tran-
sition to the more different customs
of the real Spain.

Barcelona was made memorable

by the acquaintance of a young stu-
dent of flamenco dancing, who took
us to see an outstanding perform-
ance of that art as well as to one
of his own lessons. It was also
through his guidance that we were
able to see some of the less con-
spicuous, but more typical, parts of
old Barcelona.
It was here also that we first dis-
covered the low prices which we
were to enjoy everywhere in Spain.
We found accommodations in a pen-
sion in the center of the city where
for room, continental breakfast, 4-
course lunch, and 5-course dinner
we each paid about $1.50 a day.
Other examples of these prices are
30c for a delicious meal in a very
good restaurant, and 10c for a liter of
| table wine.

A 12-hour wait between trains in
| Madrid allowed time for little more
than a whirlwind tour of the Prado

 

 

Museum—which houses the great
collections of El Greco, Velasquez and
Goya—and of downtown Madrid, in-
cluding the Royal Palace. The latter,
whose gardens are still beautifully
kept, is strangely quiet and aban-
doned, as it awaits the return to
monarchy which it is understood
Franco will effect at his death.

Another overnight train ride
through the Sierra Nevada and past
Toledo and Granada and we were in
Malaga in the colorful and thourgh-
ly Spanish province of Andalusia.
It was near Malaga, in a village that
is a winter haven of vacationing
Spanish, Swedes, English, and Amer-
icans that we settled for three weeks
of work(?). Among the notable parts
of our stay there was a celebration
of Christmas in the Spanish fashion,
ie. with bullfights on the first and
last days of Christmas and gift-
giving on Epiphany.

Apart from the beautiful country
and the generally low prices, the
most salient characteristics of the
country were the extreme friendli-
ness and helpfulness of its people
and the rather astonishing extent
to which police practices were in ef-
fect. Members of the militia, or “civil
guard,” were to be seen everywhere,
and Spanish citizens’ passes were
checked on every train trip, even
internally.

For a long time, our efforts to
find a Spaniard willing to discuss

form of expression has long since
grown up it deserves to be treated
as any other media. Nevertheless,
Justice Clark said in the Times case
that the movies are not necessarily
subject to the same rules that govern
other means of communication.

Should Be Special

With this I cannot agree. As was
pointed out by the dissent, the de-
cision “presents a real danger of
eventual censorship for every form
of communication be it newspapers,
journals, books, magazines, televi-
sion, radio or public speeches.”

The Supreme Court decision
handed down last Monday places
censorship in a high position hereto-
fore deemed unlikely. The case in
issue is the Times Film Corp case
involving a film known as Don Juan
which was not allowed to be shown
in Chicago.

This decision gives approval to
forms of prior restraint such as
that practiced in Chicago. There a
film can be exhibited to the pub-
lic only if the Police Commission-
er or some person designated by
him gives approval. This scheme, in
effect, is to give licence to a method
of prior restraint which by logical
inference could be carried over to
books, news media and even
speeches.

A Supreme Court opinion handed
down in 1931 was thought to remove

IT’S TIME FOR 14-GAME ROAD LOSING STRING TO END

 

Cagers King At Home, But On Road--It’s Another Tale

It’s been 14 long games _ since
Washington and Lee’s basketball

But coach Bob McHenry isn’t es-

that year.

almost all doubts as to the court’s
feeling on prior restraint. In the
1931 case of Near v. Minnesota a
newspaper editor was required to
get the newspaper approved before
he distributed it. The court said that
this was the worst form of freedom
of the press coming down from the
First Amendment under denial of
the freedom of speech.

Justice Hughes Said

In writing that opinion Chief Jus-
tice Hughes said, “that liberty of
the press, historically considered and
taken up by the Federal Constitution, |
has meant, principally although not
exclusively, immunity from previous
restraints or censorship.” The Times

the same general heading, freedom of
expression.

Today there are only four states
and 15 cities which have movie cen-

sorship boards. Since the decision |
in 1931 it has been thought that |

they would be found unconstitution-
al, so that even those censorship
boards still in existence have not ex-
ercised much of their inherant power.

The dissent in this case recalls the |

evils and assininities which are evi-
denced by censorship in the part.
The four justices strongly discuss our
heritage of freedom which comes
down from the First Amendment.
“Whether—as here—city officials or—
as in Russia—a political party lays
claim to the power of governmental
censorship, whether the pressures are
for a conformist moral code or for
a conformist political ideology, no
such regime is permitted by the First
Amendment.”

Merely because the case at hand
involves censorship of movies should
not exempt it from the general rule.
By deciding that the Chicago board
may practice prior restraint on the
showing of films the court had im-
pliedly authorized the sterile moral-
ism of the censor in any media. The
court has at least reminded us of
our freedoms and the constant need
for their reassertion. It is difficult
to forsee all the consequences of this
revival of censorship; we can only
hope that it will be confined or
subsequently overruled.

McLin Considers Spanish Interests, Politics

(Continued from page 2)
politics were all in vain. Even the
professors from whom we were tak-
ing Spanish lessons admonished us
that “this is only for purposes of
the lesson, and afterwards I forget
anything that I have said.” And even
after that warning, he was not out-
spoken.

team accounted for the final record
of the afternoon as they combined
to travel the course in 3:42.2.

Coach Norris Eastman commented
in an interview after the meet that
“it was good for the boys; they like
to feel what it’s like going up against
good competition; however, it always
hurts to lose.”

At this point in the season, the
Generals have a 3-2 record, and the
top scorers to date are Jim Parker
with 43 points, Elliott Maynard with
38 points, and Herb Jahncke with 28
points.

The tankmen face American Uni-
versity of Washington, D.C., in their
next meet Feb. 6. The following day
they meet Georgetown University,
also in Washington.

We were elated to meet, near the
end of our stay, a professor of Eng-
lish from the University of Madrid
who was somewhat more outspoken
on the subject. Having fought for
the Nationalists in the Civil War—
fighting in which he lost a leg—he
was freer than most to discuss poli-
tics.

It was his belief that Franco is
governing just as much through the
opinion-making offices of the Roman
Catholic Church as through the small
number of syndicalists and large
landowners who comprise the Pha-
lange party. And, far from denying
the use of force in Spain, he main-
tained that force was necessary to
the government of any Latin people,
who are naturally anarchistic. Our
discussion with him was an interest-
ing seminar in Hobbs political theory.

The French government is not very
popular, nor totally unpopular.

American aid to France and the
current campaign of the Spanish
government to encourage American
tourism in Spain make unsurprising
the statement of one Spaniard that
it is the minority of the people who
support Franco who also are pro-
American.

Loren Gergens briefs two of his salesmen on new telephone services for business customers.

“| DIDN’T WANT TO BE STOCKPILED”

When Loren

Gergens was working for his

B.S. degree in Business Administration at the
University of Denver, he had definite ideas about
the kind of job he wanted to land. He was de-
termined to profit from the experience of several
of his friends who had accepted promising jobs
only to find themselves in “manpower pools” —
waiting to be pulled into a responsible position.
“I didn’t want to be stockpiled,” Loren says.
“That’s no way to start.”

As a senior, Loren talked to twelve companies
and joined The Mountain States Telephone &
Telegraph Company, an associated company of
the Bell Telephone System.

From his first day challenges were thrown at
him thick and fast. First, he supervised a group
of service representatives who handle the com-
munications needs of telephone customers. Then

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“Our number one aim is to have in all
management jobs the most vital, intelli-
gent, positive and imaginative men we
can possibly find.”

FREDERICK R, KAPPEL, President

American Telephone & Telegraph Co.

he served as manager of several telephone busi-
ness offices. In these jobs Loren had to prove
himself on the firing line, make right decisions
and carry them through. He knew his next jump
depended on only one man—Loren Gergens.

In July, 1960, he was made Sales Manager

in Boulder, Colorado.

“T’m on the ground floor of a newly created
telephone marketing organization. And I can tell
you things are going to move fast!’’ Loren says.
“It’s rough at times, but hard work is fun when
you know you're going somewhere—in a busi-
ness where there’s somewhere to go.”

If you're interested in a job in which you can
be your own prime mover—a job in which you’re
given a chance to show what you can do, right from
the start—you’ll want to visit your Placement Office
for literature and additional information.
