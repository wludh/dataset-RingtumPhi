Tucker Series
Will Emphasize

Criminal Law

The Honorable E. Barrett Pretty-
man, Chief Judge of the United States
Court of Appeals at Washington, D. C.,
will be the featured speaker at the
Tucker Law Lectures, April 21 and 22.
He will give a series of three lectures
on the general topic, “Some Modern
Problems in the Criminal Law.”

Prettyman was born on August 23,
1891, here in Lexington. He attended
Randoph-Macon College and George-
town University where he received his
LL.B. and L.L.D.

Judge Prettyman has been very ac-
tive in governmental affairs. He served
as Special Attorney to the Bureau of
Internal Revenue from 1919 to 1920.
In 1933 he was appointed General
Counsel to the Bureau. In 1945 he was
appointed to the Court of Civil Appeals
where he now presides. Judge Pretty-
man also has been a professor of tax-
ation at the Georgetown University
Law School, as well as trustee of
Randolph-Macon College. He is a
member of Phi Beta Kappa, Kappa
Sigma, Omicron Delta Kappa, and
Sigma Upsilon.

Judge Prettyman is the author of
many articles on taxation and admin-
istrative practices of law. He now re-
sides in Chevy Chase, Md.

The Board of Trustees established
the Tucker Law Lectures, during the
Bicentennial of the University in 1949,
in memory of John Randolph Tucker,
the first dean of the law school. Since
that time, the lectures have brought
many distinguished speakers to the
W&L campus.

The initial series of lectures was de-
livered by the Honorable John W.
Davis. He has been followed by a
series of outstanding lecturers, includ-
ing the Honorable Arthur Vanderbilt,
chief justice of the Supreme Court
of New Jersey, and John J. McCloy,
chairman of the Board of the Chase-
Manhattan Bank.

 

Skiing Season
Begins Dec. 18

The Homestead’s winter recreational
area will be open for business when
Washington and Lee students return
from the Christmas holidays. The Hot
Springs, Virginia resort has set the
week of December 18-24 for the tent-
ative opening of their skiing and ice-
skating facilities.

Washington and Lee students flock-
ed to the Homestead last year to en-
joy the first large scale ski resort and
winter sports development in the state
of Virginia. Sepp Kober, noted Aus-
trian ski expert, heads the Homestead
ski school, which offers instruction
for the beginner, intermediate, and ex-
pert. Ice-skating lessons are also avail-
able for those who prefer the ice rink
to the ski slopes.

Kober was recently in Lexington at
the Robert E. Lee Hotel to promote
winter sports in this area. His lectures,
accompanied by films and a showing
of ski fashions, were attended by over
three hundred winter sports fans.

Pres Brown, sponsor of Kober’s
visit, has a full line of ski equipment
for sale and rental use, including over
sixty pairs of skis and boots. The
rental fee for a twenty-four hour
period is five dollars for skis, boots, and
poles.

Saturday and Sunday are considered
as one rental day, with Friday, Satur-
day, and Sunday grouped for two days
rental charge. For prospective buyers
of ski equipment, Pres Brown’s Sport
Shop plans to allow any two rental
fees to be used toward the purchase of
any of the rental items.

The College Town Shop has also
entered the skiing market with the
addition of ski clothing and acces-
sories for sale. On display are ski
pants, sweaters, gloves, and other
items designed to completely out-
fit the ski enthusiast.

With Lexington ready to outfit the
W&L skier, the Homestead is ready
to provide him with snow. The Hot
Springs resort operated successfully
last winter by laying an artificial snow
base on a slope that is over three
thousand feet long and over three
hundred feet wide. This season they
plan to add a trail for the more ad-
vanced skiers. Servicing both runs is
an enclosed car lift which safely trans-
ports skiers to the top of the slopes.

The Homestead has agreed to pro-
vide a special weekly rate for W&L
students. Through the skiing season
the regular $5 rate for use of the
skiing and ice -skating area will be
reduced to a student rate of $3.

SWMSFC Tryouts
To Be December 7-9

The 1961 SWMSFC Musical will hold
tryouts for twenty-five male singing
and acting parts this week. The audi-
tions are set for Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday, Dec. 7-9, from 7 until
10 p.m., at the Troubadour Theater.

Steve Danzansky, producer and di-
rector of the annual Spring Musical,
announced that all male singing and
acting parts are available and that
all Washington and Lee students are
eligible. He expressed the desire that
any interested student be present for
the auditions regardless of previous
acting or singing experience. Danzan-
sky added, “Those trying out for sing-
ing parts may sing any selections that
they wish, and may have the use of our
piano player for accompanyment. All
students trying out for acting roles
will be supplied with dialogue in the
show from which to read.”

This year’s SWMSFC Musical will
involve well over 100 students, mak-
ing the production the largest extra-
curricular activity on the W&L cam-
pus. Last year’s show, “The Cannon’s
Mouth,” played to a capacity crowd
of over 1,000 during its four-day run
last spring. “The Cannon’s Mouth”
was also written, produced, and di-

 

UCA Sponsors
Boys’ Cave Trip

The winners of the Thanksgiving
football game sponsored by the UCA
Boys’ Club received their promised
reward last Friday afternoon. Al-
though the trip into Cave Spring had
been postponed several days because
of a plague of hour quizzes among
the W&L Spelunkers, the youngsters
were finally rewarded.

Only about half of the eleven mem-
bers of the winning team were able
to make the trip because of pressing
business matters. Friday afternoon,
when the trip was taken, coincides
with the delivery time for the Rock-
bridge County News, and several of the
boys were thus engaged. However, Roy
Carpenter, head of the Boys’ Club,
felt that more time was valuably spent
within the cave as a result of the}
smallness of the group.

Cave Spring is well known to all!
freshmen geology students, past and |
present. It is located about a mile}
west of Lexington just off route 60.

Under the guidance of Spelunker
Greg Allen, the boys, dressed in old
clothes and equipped with flashlights,
entered the cave. Greg led them
through several portions of the rocky
labyrinth, explaining that the cave had
been formed by the action of water on
limestone and pointing out the stalag-
mites and stalagtites which have grown
there. The exploration continued for
about an hour (3:30-4:30 p.m.).

Roy Carpenter, who also accom-
panied the boys, said, “In spite of the
muddiness and darkness, the boys all |
seemed to enjoy the trip, probably be-
cause it was something they would be
unable to do without proper supervi-
sion. Personally, I had as much fun|
as they did. I had never been in the |
cave before.”

Many W&L men have helped this
fall to make the UCA football teams
a success. Among these are Meade
Christian, Dick Roberts, Bob Ketch-
am, Ted Freed, Jack Cover, and Nick
Phillips. These boys are now super-
vising the Boys’ Club winter program
of basketball. Passing, dribbling, and
shooting are being stressed.

As a_ supplementary program,
“Puncher” Robrecht has agreed to in-
struct the boys in the fundamentals
of boxing.

 

 

Dr. Hughes Named New

Vann, Hardwick Attend
Foreign Affairs Meetin g

The 11th Annual Student Conference
on Foreign Affairs offered “tremen-
dous insights into the United States’s
foreign policy,” according to Jim Vann,
one of two Washington and Lee dele-
gates to the conference held last week
at West Point.

Vann and Pearce Hardwick repre-
sented W&L at the conference, spon-
sored each year “to foster the growth
and mutual understanding among po-
tential military and civilian leaders of
coming generations, thus making a sig-
nificant contribution toward the future
security of the United States.”

Over 80 colleges and universities
were represented.

“All the prestige schools were
there,” said Hardwick. “It was good
company for W&L to move in.”

Vann, who served as a member of
a panel on the Atlantic Community
explained that the purpose of the con-
ference was to draw up a series of
recommendations for presentation to
the State Department.

Hardwick met with a group discuss-
ing international law.

“We didn’t really come to any
great conclusions,” said Hardwick.
“But we did come to appreciate the
problems of those who have to make
the big decisions for America.”

 

Christmas Seal Drive |
To Begin This Week |

This week marks the opening of the |
annual fund raising drive held by the |
Rockbridge-Buena Vista Tuberculosis
Association. The W&L student body |
will be a part of this drive. All stu-

| dents will be sent one sheet of Christ- |

mas Seals and an envelope addressed |
to the T.B. Association. If a student de- |
sires to help the fund raising drive|
he should put a donation in the en- |
velope and drop it in the nearest mail- |
box. |
The money received will be used |
for patient services, rehabilitation, |
health education, and X-ray and clin- |
ical services. The expected goal for the |
Rockbridge-Buena Vista area
$7,000.

The executive director of the asso-
cation, Mrs. R. M. Cummings, said,
“In the past, Washington and Lee stu-
dents have not only given generously,
but also they have participated in
volunteer work. This year, for example,
one of the school newspaper editors is
a member of the Publicity Committee
of the Rockbridge-Buena Vista Tuber-
culosis Association.”

Debaters Win
In Philadelphia

The surprising Washington and Lee
debate team defeated some of the top
schools in the East during a one-day
tournament held last Saturday in
Philadelphia, Pa.

Bill Buice, SAE, and Dick Kelly,
Pi Phi, debated the affirmative side
of the question, “Resolved: The U.S.
Should Have Socialized Medicine,” and
went undefeated for the tournament.
Buice and Kelly compiled a 4-0 record
by defeating highly regarded Cornell,
Notre Dame, La Salle, and Penn State.

The negative team, composed of Bill
Boardman, Beta and George Birdsong,
SAE, finished with a 2-2 record. Their
only losses came from undefeated
Army, who had just won the Brown
University Debate Tournament, and
from St. Joseph’s, one of the power-
houses of the East. Boardman and
Birdsong won their debates against
Boston College and Catholic Univer-
sity.

Mr. William W. Chaffin, coach and
advisor to the W&L debaters, sent an
inexperienced quartet to Philadelphia.
Three of the four participants had
never had any tournament experience,
and one man, Dick Kelly, knew noth-
ing about debating until last Tuesday.
Teams from 61 schools went to the
Philadelphia tournament, making it
one of the largest on the East Coast.

Mr. Chaffin said he was pleased with
the showing the team has been making,
“but it must not be forgotten that de-
bating is primarily an educational ex-
perience and that compiling a winning
record is of secondary importance,
consequently when we travel to
Bridgewater on Thursday, those de-
baters who have made no trips will be

| given the first opportunity to go.”

 

NOTICE

The Troubadour meeting tonight
will be held in the theatre at 7:00
rather than 7:30.

Danzansky is currently putting the
finishing touches on the 1961 Musical,
an adaptation of an old Greek comedy
by Aristophanes. He said, “With these
tryouts the Musical swings into its
second important stage. We want all
talented students to be present for the
auditions, for if the show hits the road
we need the best possible cast to rep-
resent W&L. We have the ability and
the resources on this campus to put on
a top-notch musical, as was shown
in last year’s show, “The Cannon’s
Mouth.” This year will require, how-
ever, twice as many people, making
it requisite for every qualified person
to volunteer his services to SWMFSC
and to the school.”

SWM Group
Expands Show

The Student War Memorial Schol-
arship Fund Committee has announced
plans to expand their yearly musical,
in hopes that enough funds can be
raised to provide for a second func-
tioning scholarship by the fall of 1961.
A prominent arranger has been hired
to assist in the production, and this
will cause an increase in the general
expenses.

These additional expenses will be
met by taking the show on the road to
increase the gross receipts. The com-
mittee has scheduled performances in
Lynchburg, Roanoke, and Richmond,
relying heavily on the support of the
alumni in these areas. Included in the
proposed plans are agreements with
alumni groups in the three cities to
underwrite parts of the show by as-
suring their attendance. The expand-
ed program will call for a gross of
$3,500 as compared to $1,000 last year.

Sets Easily Transported

A spokesman for SWMSFC stated:
“We are going to make sets that can
be easily transported to the cities on
the proposed road trip. Those reading
the first act and hearing the songs feel
that this year’s musical will have ap-
peal to alumni, as well as to the W&L
students.”

SWMSFC was set up in the years
following World War II to establish
a scholarship in memory of the Wash-
ington and Lee men who gave their
lives in the war. The principal ($10,000)
earned from past musicals and activities
has been invested with the University
and the scholarship winner receives
the interest on the original invest-
ment. The scholarship is awarded an-
nually by a faculty committee on the
basis of need, high school record and
ability. The committee is planning to
establish a second scholarship of equal
value.

Costume Sales
End Thursday

Mrs. Arlene Stover from Oak Hall
costume distributors in Roanoke is
visiting the Washington and Lee cam-
pus this week to take orders for Fancy
Dress costumes.

Mrs, Stover will be here Wednesday

 

 

 

and Thursday to complete the initial
ordering of costumes. She will also be
back in January to complete orders
and measurements for the Shakespear-
ean costumes.

Measurements Not Necessary

Mrs, Stover remarked that it was
not necessary for students to have their
dates measurements to order a cos-
sume. Students may have themselves
measured now, and then send in their
dates’ measurements when they have
them.

Students must be measured for the
following specifications: chest, waist,
height, weight, outseam, and hat size.
In addition, they must provide the fol-
lowing measurements for their dates:
Bust, waist, hips, height, weight, dress
size and length of skirt, from waist to
ankle.

The theme is Shakespearean, and
students may pick costumes from any
of the Shakespearean plays. As a re-
sult there are costumes from the
Egyptian and Roman periods, the medi-
eval period, the Italian and French
Renaissance ages as well as from the
Elizabethan era.

The costumes cost $16 for those stu-
dents who have Dance Plans. Those
students who do not have the plans
must pay $18 for the set.

The costumes are being sold from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the Student Union.

Overload?

The honor system at Washington and Lee is our most
precious tradition. We must guard it zealously. Everyone is
agreed on these points. We question the manner in which it
must be guarded.

 

Again we come to the question of overload. Certainly the
system should not be overloaded. But we would admonish those
who are making the decisions of whether this or that field of
student activity should or should not come under the system
to proceed with caution; to be careful lest they exclude too much
and thereby weaken our system.

It is true that our student body constitution states that the
honor system shall be interpreted in accordance with the mores
and ideas of the contemporary student generation. The provi-

sion of the constitution is for obvious reasons a wise one. It en-
ables us to prevent our system from becoming overloaded.

We feel, however, that a slight overload would be more
desirable than a system which had been weakened through the
withdrawal of honor system support from the various fields of

student activity.

Would it not be more sensible to wait and consider each
case as it arises rather than to declare whole areas of University
life to be beyond honor system control? Each year, the new
Executive Committee of the Student Body has the right to re-
interpret the system, and to state which of these various areas
it considers to be outside of the system.

Under this plan, changes are made from year to year con-
cerning various infringements of the honor code. A good deal
of confusion results which could easily lead to embarrassing
situations for members of the Student Body and the Executive
Committee. Could this confusion not be avoided by dealing
with each case separately? After all the EC does have the right
to decide whether or not the circumstances surrounding a case
warrant taking the case to trial.

Christmas Seal Campaign

Sometime between now and Christmas, the Lexington
Christmas Seal Campaign will be brought into the fraternity
houses of Washington and Lee. This year’s campaign leaders
have decided to appear before the respective houses in person,
in hopes of making the drive more successful this year than it
has been in the past.

With the aid of house officers an the cooperation of the
IFC, these dedicated folk hope to appear before every house on
campus during one of their fraternity meetings. At that time
they plan to distribute the usual quota of seals and to solicit
what ever aid might be forthcoming from the Student Body.

Dr. Spencer Spent Last Summer
At World Geologic Congress;
Visiting European Universities

By HARVEY ALLEN
While most of us either went home,

tied in with his current work in Mon-
tana.

to summer school, or to ROTC camp,
Dr. Edgar W. Spencer and his wife
were in Europe.

The primary purpose of the trip was
to enable Dr. Spencer, of the W&L
geology department, to attend the
eighty-third meeting of the Interna-
tional Geologic Congress. The Con-
gress meets once every four years, and
met this year in Copenhagen, Denmark.
The meetings lasted from August 15
to 25, during which members were
divided among several sections, each
dealing with various aspects of geology.

Separate symposiums were held on
particular problems in the world of
geology, such as the one Dr. Spencer
attended, having to do with the geology
of the Pre-Cambrian times and de-
formation of the earth’s crust. For those
unschooled in geology, the pre-Cam-
brian age lasted until about 550,000,000
years ago.

The symposiums in which Dr.
Spencer took part tied in with his
continuing research in the Yellow-
stone-Big Horn area in Montana. He
is studying in a predominantly pre-
Cambrian area, with particular inter-
est in structures and formations.

Before and after the actual meetings
of the International Geologic Confer-
ence, delegates took the opportunity to
go on field trips in various parts of
Europe. As an example, Dr. Spencer
traveled in the Scandinavian Shield
area, resembling the Canadian Shield
here in North America, once again

 

Following the formal conferences
and meetings in Copenhagen, Dr. and
Mrs. Spencer toured the Alps region,
criss-crossing the area and visiting
several colleges and universities.

Dr. Spencer observed that the
European Universities’ geology de-
partments were largely understaff-
ed, resulting in a very undesirable
student-professor ratio. He quickly
added that this did not mean Euro-
pean universities were by any means
behind us in knowledge or research,
but only suffered from a lack of po-
sitions available to qualified men in
the field of geology.

Keeping in mind that most people
are very interested in just what the
Russians are doing and how advanced
they are, we asked Dr. Spencer about
Russian advancement in geology. He
said that there is no evidence that the
Russians are lacking in knowledge and
are certainly not far behind the west-
ern schools.

Dr. Spencer’s trip was sponsored
by the National Science Foundation,
and the Glenn Grants here at Wash-
ington and Lee. The Spencers left
Lexington on the third of June and
returned September 6.

Dr. Spencer is presently the vice-
president of Yellowstone-Big Horn
Research Association, and is serving on
the committee recently set up by Gov-

ernor Almond to advise in the field of |

geology.

“Age Of New Frontiers,” Like Eve,
Fears Boredom, Demands Diversion

By GERRY OUELLETTE

Several weeks ago a classmate of
ours remarked that we were a genera-
tion doomed to utter intellectual dis-
interestedness. He assumed that the
great events of which we are all the
by products had somehow usurped our
vitality, the means of rendering our
human condition interesting. Thus he
saw no possibility of anyone becoming
attached, rooted in any manner which
makes for great emotional exhuberance
in things other than very personal.

Last week a colleague branded our
generation in the Friday edition with
the label “silent generation.” This re-
curring theme, making us appear as a
group of uncommitted, unaffected, de-
tached individuals, is one which seems
to us more cruel, more inhuman than
bohemianism or beatism.

Once in a garden, a girl by the
name of Eve, sitting by her mate,
stood and observed, “Golly, there

must be something to do in this in-
fernal place other than sleep and
lounge around to pass the time of
day.” So she took a walk around the
place for the sake of diversion. Along
the way she met a talking serpent.
“Well,” she thought, “how interest-
ing.” And so it began.

Much later, man, having survived
all sorts of ingenious means of natural
and self-made destruction, found him-
self sleeping and lounging around in
a society that gave him more leisure
time than any other the world had
witnessed. Man rose, looked around,
and said, “Boy, how disinteresting all
this is. It really isn’t even worth talk-
ing about, so I guess I’l just be silent.”
In the meantime, man walked over
to his twenty-one inch television set,
sat in front of it for several hours, got
up and went to a movie.

We must admit that the conten-

 

tions made by both of our classmates

because we worry that these far re-
moved activities will bore us or will
prevent us from providing for our
entertainment.

This silent generation is constantly
called upon to act, to move in paths
of self entertainment. This genera-
tion demands to be entertained. We
are a generation of spectators, of
onlookers witnessing the great spec-
tacle of life. We are caught in an
infinite regression: we watch others
who watch others et cetera ad infini-
tum.

have enough truth in them to make
them impressive. We of the third de-
cade of the twentieth century are
disinterested, we are silent. (It’s so
much easier.) We settle back in the
comfortable spare time which our
fathers won for us through toil and
sweat, and we turn on the television
set they invented.

Nevertheless, our behavior, reflecting
our disinterestedness and silence, ap-
pears more a symptom than as the
disease itself. Yes indeed, we of the
“Age of New Frontiers” are diseased

with fear. We have a fear more deadly,! We do what we do, or we avoid do-

more corruptible than the fear of fear
itself.

We are all good sons of our parents;
we are intellectually disinterested and
actually silent because we are afraid
to death of being bored. We fear
boredom as hell itself; we consequent-
ly take no interest in things not im-

ing what we would rather omit, be-
cause we are fighting. We are strug-
gling with a new ingenious means of
destruction: the fear of becoming bored
in a world equipped to provide the
time and other necessities with which
to become detached, unaffected, un-
committed, and utterly boring our-

 

mediately and purposely affecting us,! selves.

LETTERS

TO THE Q

Christmas is still a month away, but

Dear Editor:

the town merchants have the decor-
ations in the windows, the Christmas
lights are in the streets and the
Christmas parade including Santa and
all his trappings have passed through
the streets of Lexington.

The merchants have no choice. They
must remind the folk of our fair city
that Christmas is just a month away
and that there are only a few pre-
cious shopping days left until $mas.
The town lights were already weeks
behind those of the neighboring large
cities.

St. Nick, in our wonderful commer-
c'al Christmas tradition, had begun to
make his appearance weeks before
Thanksgiving. His legions will con-
tinue to grow until the 25th of this
month by which time there will be a
red suit and a white beard on every
street and corner and cross roads in
the U.S. Of late, he’s even begun to
travel in rocket ships.

We can attribute all of this to the
“American Way” and the scandalous
commercialization of our Christmas.
It must be accepted, and maybe it isn’t
too terrible after all.

What we can’t shrug off is the fact
that even the private homes of this

Thinking” Assignment Finished
In Spite Of Pastoral Distractions

By ED WEBSTER

The assignment was a little bit un-
usual. “This week,” said the professor,
“TI want each of you to spend an hour
just thinking.”

That was that. He didn’t specify what
to think about, or where to think.

Saturday afternoon, when the sun
had just warmed the edge off the frosty
air, seemed a good time to complete
the assignment. Putting binoculars
around my neck and a pipe in my
pocket, I headed for the large area
of woods and fields lying between the
campus and the river.

I made my way down a vine-tangled
slope, to enter what I hoped was a
world of stillness and harmony.

While hiking along a dry creek
bed near the railroad cut, I received
my first disillusionment. At a flat
place on the bank, their red labels
clashing with the underbrush, were
several dozen empty Sterno cans.

Apparently I had stumbled onto the

scene of some hobo bacchanalia.

HOW COME THE
SCHOOLS DON'T
CLOSE ON
BEETHOVEN'S
BIRTH

?

 

Being unprepared for this little taste
of sordidness, I tramped across the
field toward a more idyllic locale.
Through an open grove of cedar trees,
I could see the river in the distance,
with the late afternoon sun slanting
across the hills.

It was then that the sound of gun-
fire assailed me. Not sporadic gunfire,
but a constant banging, intensified by
many echoes. It was like someone
walloping a drum during a pastoral
symphony.

On the ground beneath me, how-
ever, the frost on the leaves was un-
disturbed. These bits of dead vegata-
tion, always in the shade, had accumu-
lated thick white clusters of geometri-
cal whatnots—a microcosmic snowfall.

I came out of the grove and started
down to the river. A few indignant
sparrows, disturbed from their re-
treats in a patch of weeds, sped furtive-
| ly into a clump of honeysuckle.

 

Up the river, a cry rang out,

Generals Handed Third Straight Defeat

W&L Five Lose To Norfolk
And Richmond By 67-45, 80-51

Although good hustle by the Gen-
erals kept them in the Norfolk game
in the first half, they wilted under
the shooting and rebounding of Little
All-American Leo Anthony in the sec-
ond half. Anthony paced the Braves’
game with 27 points while Ken Ko-
walski led the Generals with 14 points.

WA&L got off to a good start in the
game and was able to keep the Wil-
liam and Mary team contained in
the first half through the efforts of
Brett Thackston, John McDowell and
Kowalski. The play making of
Thackston, rebounding of McDowell,
and shooting of Kowalski however,
kept the hopes of the Doremus Gym
audience alive.

Anthony dominated the first half
play with his fancy shots and tallied
up a total of 11 points. The Braves
were able to drop in a few last minute
baskets to lead at the half time by
31-24.

The W&L five chalked up two
quick tallies at the start of the sec-
ond half to cut Norfolk William and
Mary’s lead to 31-28 but the re-
bounding and shooting accuracy of
the Braves soon showed through.
During the second half the Generals
were suddenly unable to hit from the
floor, and Norfolk was able to build
up a sizeable lead. The W&L attack
was further hurt when John Mc-
Dowell was forced to sit out most of
the half with an ankle injury.

From there on out the Braves con-
trolled the ball most of the time with
the Generals scoring only 8 baskets.

 

The game ended with a 67-45 victory
for the Braves of Norfolk.

The Generals’ third defeat came last
night with their game with the Uni-
versity of Richmond. The Spiders
used the fast break to their advant-
age and routed the Blue and White,
80-51.

Washington and Lee got off to a
fast start, hitting five of its first seven
shots to take a 10-4 lead over the
Spiders. But then the Generals be-
gan to cool which gave the Richmond
team an opportunity to make some
baskets of their own. In the next
eleven attempts, the Generals hit
only one basket, and Richmond, get-
ting some expert firing from Tom
Brooker, went to a 15-12 edge over
the Generals after ten minutes.

A few minutes later Richmond scor-
ed 12 consecutive points, mostly on
layups, to move into the leading po-
sition 33-16. At the halftime the score
stood 43-21.

In the second half the story was
about the same with the Spiders con-
trolling the ball the greater part of
the time. The Generals came no
closer than 17 points in the second
half and the final score was 80-51.

The next two games that the Blues
will play are with Randolph-Macon
on Thursday night at Ashland and
then return home to Doremus Gymna-
sium to a game with Sewanee.

 

The VMI Athletic Department has
announced a 75c ticket for home
basketball games will be available to
all W&L students and faculty.

‘Grapplers Lose
To UNC—16-15

The Generals’ wrestling team was
defeated last Friday night in a close
match with the University of North
Carolina by a 16-15 score. There were
three pins in the match, two of them
taken by W&lL, and the remaining
events were decisions, with one draw.

The Blue and White won the 123,
147, 167, and 177 pound classes while
the Tarheels scored in the remaining
divisions. In the 123 lb. class, Dave
Montgomery won over his opponent
by a decision; in the 130 Ib. class
Alex Alexander was defeated by a
decision; in the 137 Ib. class Ted
Hardin was defeated also by a de-
cision; in the 147 Ib. class Sandy
Mersereau pinned his opponent,
Jones, in 6:55; in the 157 Ib. class
Albert was defeated by a decision;
in the 167 Ib. class, Herb Smith pin-
ned his opponent, Wyke, in 7:30; in
the 177 lb. class Jud Babcock and
Galser of UNC had a draw match,
2-2; and in the heavyweight class
Sam Block was pinned by Kortner
in 4:05.

Coach Dick Miller pointed out that
the weak spots of the team this year
lay in the lower weight classes es-
pecially the 130 and 137 slots. The
heavier weights such as 167, 177, and
heavyweights “are the best boys that
I have seen and this should be our
strength this year,” Coach Miller said.
He was especially pleased with the
performance of freshman Herb Smith,
who occupies the 167 lb. slot, and
p.nned his man in his first match.

 

Varsity & Frosh
Meet Virginia

The varsity and freshman swimming
teams will meet the University of
Virginia in Doremus Gymnasium to-
night. The senior squad will be looking
for its second win in as many starts,

while this is the initial test for the
freshmen.

Coach Norris Eastman feels that, “a
team effort, with improvement from
every swimmer” will be necessary to
sink the Cavaliers. Last year’s meet
with Virginia started off as a tight
contest, but turned into a 56-39 rout
for Washington and Lee.

The tankmen face Catholic Univer-
sity here Saturday, and then meet a
tough West Virginia team at Morgan-
town, Dec. 12.

The Baby Generals have meets with
Staunton, Massanutten, and Lynchburg
before the Christmas holidays. The
Staunton meet is away, while the
other two are slated for the Doremus
pool.

 

Freshman Basketball Team
Defeats Fork Union, 73-42

scoring.

The freshman basketball team de-
feated Fork Union Military Academy
in Doremus Gymnasium on Saturday
afternoon by a 73-42 score. A runaway
from the start, guard Fred Ridolphi
sparked the game with his constant

Upholding the momentum of their
first game victory over the Bridge-
water freshmen, the starting lineup
of forwards Dave Britt and Steve
Walsh, guards Gordon Taylor and
Ridolphi, and center Howard Mar-
tin handled the Fork Union team
with relative ease. With a sizeable
lead, Coach Joe Lyles was able to
use the whole squad during the
final quarter of the game.

Ridolphi, high scorer in the Bridge-
water game with 18 points, was again
top man in this game with 16, but was
joined in his position by sub Fred
Shaeffer, who also scored 16 points.
The next high man was center Martin

with 14 points.

 

All-State Choices

7 W&L Players
Honored By AP;
3 On Ist Team

Six members of the Washington and
Lee football team were named to the
Associated Press Virginia All-State
small college football team.

Little All-American Terry Fohs re-
ceived the center position on the first
team. In addition, Steve Suttle and
Doug Martin were included among
the backs o nthe first team.

Ned Hobbs, an end, was given an
honorable mention berth, as were Bill
Wheeler, a tackle, Charlie Gummey
the backs on the first team.

These awards are especially signifi-
cant since this is the first time since
1954 that a Washington and Lee
player has been named to the first
team.

All of these players are juniors, and
with the exception of Fohs, all will
be returning to varsity positions next
year.

Ned Hobbs was elected by the team
as one of next year’s tri-captains.

sounding somewhere between a moan
and a shriek. It was followed by an-
other.

Focusing my binoculars on the river
bank, I saw a small group of students,
wearing nothing but bermuda shorts.
They were, so help me, taking dips
in the river. Considering that ice lined
the Maury in several places, these
fellows had good reason to shriek.

Giving moral support to these stoics
were a handful of girls. They were
probably very impressed. What an idea
for a Saturday afternoon date: go down
to the river and watch somebody
catch pneumonia.

% * Se

For my part, I was content to ob-
serve the river from a weathered gray
rock. Below me, in a quiet pool, the
leaves of summer had matted into a
sombre patchwork quilt, undisturbed
by the rushing current. On the far
bank, twilight was creeping upward in
the branches of three sun-gilded syca-
mores.

With pipe smoke curling about me,
and the rumble of rapids drowning out
the growl of traffic, I was finally able
to do some thinking. It’s a little easier
to see things in perspective, when
you're alone in the out-of-doors.
(Question: Why do we refer to nature
as “the out-of-doors,” as though it
were something outside the normal
scope of human experience? )

When the sun got pretty far down,
I became colder than contempla-
tive. After warming myself in front of
a fire, I wandered slowly back to the
campus.

Each year, Washington and Lee has |
one of the most beautiful Christmas |
services that we have ever had the!
privilege to attend in the Robert E. |
Lee Memorial Church. For 3 years now, |
this event, which is held during the |
last week preceding the Christmas |
vacation, has first stirred in us the!
spirit of the Christmas season. And
it was not until after this service that
the lights, the tree and the rest have

come to mean anything to us.

The thing that hurts us most about
the local scene is the fact that one of
our campus trees has already been
decorated. A decorated Christmas tree
before the middle of December is al-
most as out of place as an Easter Bun-
ny in a snow storm. As we pass this
particular tree, we are amazed, and
then we realize that Christmas is after
all only a month away.
