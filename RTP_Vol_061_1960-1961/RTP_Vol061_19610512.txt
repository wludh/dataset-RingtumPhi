Seven Students
Present Papers

At VMI Meet

Eight Washington and Lee
professors and seven students
are taking part in the program

of the 39th annual meeting of
the Virginia Academy of Science at
VMI, May 10-13.

Dr. William M. Hinton, head of
the W&L psychology department is
the immediate past president of the
Academy. An ex-officio member of
the Council of the Academy, Dr.
Hinton is working with the judging
and host committees of the confer-
ence. He has arranged for a dinner
at the Mayflower Hotel for the
Virginia Psychological Association,
which is meeting concurrently with
the Academy.

Dr. Hinton says that “Academy
members and visitors will be wel-
come” at Washington and Lee’s new
psychology department.

Dr. Edgar W. Spencer and Dr.
Kenneth F. Bick of Washington and
Lee’s geology department will con-
duct a geological field trip tomor-
row, while other university partici-
pants will present research papers
before the various sectional meetings.

Dr. Leonard E. Jarrard, assistant
professor of psychology, will pre-
sent a paper on “The effects of Sug-
gestion and of Benzadrine and Me-
probamate on Motor Performance.”
Dr. Jarrard’s paper is the cumulative
report of previous psychology class-
es here on the effects of stimulants
and tranquilizers.

Also, presenting papers in the
psychology section of the Academy
will be students Clarence M. White-
head, Richard S. Schulist, and Drew
P. Danko. Whitehead’s paper is
concerned with “The Counterbalanc-
ing Effects of Two Antagonistic
Drugs as Determined by Bar Press-
ing and Activity in the Rat,” and
Schulist’s report is entitled “The
Effects of the Color of Numbers and
Backgrounds on the Perception of
Tachistoscopically Presented Num-
bers.”

Danko’s presentation will be based
on the research for his honors thesis,
“The Effects of High and Low Dives
on Negative Transfer in a Maze
Learning Situation.”

In the chemistry division Dr.
John H. Wise, associate professor of
chemistry, and student Edward B.
Eadie will submit a paper on “Atom-
ic and Molecular Models.” In the
same division, Dr. James K. Shil-
lington, assistant professor of Chem-
istry, and students Rardon D. Bevill
and Henry C. Hawthorne will pre-
sent a research paper on “The Syn-
thesis of Hydrazidomalonic Acid and
Its Use as a Carbonyl Reagent.”

Geology instructor C. C. Roberts
will submit to the section of geology
his report on “A Preliminary study
of the concretions in the Romney
Shale, Highland County, Virginia.”

Reflecting on his secondary school
experiences, Meade Christian will
present his paper on “The Reactions
of the Student to Advanced Place-
ment Courses” to the science teach-
ers section of the Academy.

Dr. Edward F. Turner, Dr. John
H. Wise, and Dr. William H. Hinton
will judge exhibits of the Junior
Academy of Science in the physics,
chemistry, and miscellaneous sec-
tions, respectively.

 

Ed Holmes To Head R-t P
Circulation Department

Ed Holmes, rising SAE junior from
Winona, Miss., will head the circula-
tion staff of next year’s Ring-tum Phi,
Peter Agelasto, business manager-
elect, announced today.

Other members serving on next
year’s business staff include Wes Pipes,
rising Delt sophomore from Mobile,
Ala. Tuesday circulation; and Bill
Wilkinson, rising Beta sophomore
from Dallas, Texas, Friday circula-
tion.

Walt McManus, rising Phi Psi soph-
omore from Baltimore, will serve as
Tuesday advertising manager and Don
McFall, a rising SAE sophomore from
Charleston, W. Va., will head the Fri-
day advertising.

Office managers will be Joel Goozh,
rising ZBT junior from Washington,
D.C., and Dan Reed, Phi Psi rising
junior from Baltimore.

Next year the emphasis will be on
more informative ads and a greater
number of subscriptions.

A new position this year to handle
subscriptions will be headed by Skip
Jones, SAE, and Randy Wooten, Phi
Delt, who are both rising sophomores.

Lee Research Grants

 

Students And Professors Conduct
Studies In Experimental Fields

By JOHN KIRKLEY
Friday Associate Editor

The Robert E. Lee Research
Fund has enabled some 25

Washington and Lee students:

to undertake faculty-directed
research projects this year, Dr.

William W. Pusey, dean of the

College, has announced.

Chemistry students have been
studying the ecentricities of a var-
iety of unprounceable compounds.
The Lexington market for white
rats has increased several times as
a result of vastly increased research
in the psychology department.

Budding historians and geologists
have been hard at work, as well as
students of American culture.

The Research Fund was set up
by a donation from Dr. Gustavus
Benz Capito, 99. The income from
the fund “is available to encourage
undergraduate student research
through faculty-student research
seminars and faculty-directed stu-
dent research projects,” according
to Dr. Pusey.

Dr. E. S. Gilreath, head of the

chemistry department, is conduct-
ing a long series of experiments to
determine the behavior of certain
inorganic substances in nonaqueous
media. Surprisingly enough, this is
a wide-open field, particularly the
study of solubilities in organic me-
dia.
Size of Particles Affects Stability
At the present time, Dr. Gilreath
is using methanol as the solvent
and has discovered some interesting
trends. For instance, he has found
that the relative size of the par-
ticles being put into solution af-
fects the solubility. The smaller
the cation of a substance, the greater
its solubility. On the other hand a
compound with a large anion, such
as Nal, is far more soluble than
one with a smaller anion, such as
NaCl.

Assisting Dr. Gilreath is Russell
E. Harner, a senior pre-med major.
They expect to continue the pro-
ject for several years, and are quite
pleased with results to date. So far,
the solubilities of fifty to seventy
salts in methanol have been de-
termined; for future work, other al-
cohols and also several ketones and
aldehydes will be used as solvents.

Changes In Freshman Chemistry

Three separate projects are being
carried out under the supervision
of Dr. Wise of the chemistry de-
partment. John Roper and Hugh
Trout are conducting an evaluation
of freshman experiments and lab
technique in preparation for sig-
nificant changes in the chemistry
program for freshman next year. As
usual there will be two lectures
but the two labs will be condensed
into one. The free period which this
year’s freshman have in their sche-
dule because of their having only
two lectures per week will become
a period for weekly testing and
problem solving. The time usually
devoted to problems at the begin-
ning of each laboratory period will
then be spent in the lab itself. Dr.
Wise feels that this program will
streamline the freshman chemistry
schedule considerably.

Atomic and molecular models are} is

being constructed by Ed Eadie to

 

be used as valuable teaching aids
in freshman and organic chemistry.
Ed will present a paper on his pro-
ject at the meeting of the Virginia
Academy of Science, today on the
VMI campus.

Bryan Miller is continuing a study
of the chemistry of nitrylchloride.
He is attempting to isolate this
chemical in a very pure form.

Study Mountains in Montana

Allan Curran assisted Dr. Spencer
during the past summer. For the past
eight years, Dr. Spencer has been con-
ducting an intensive study of a moun-
tain range in Montana to determine
1) the way in which the mauntains
were forded and 2) the early physical
history of this particular range.

In pre-Cambrian times, this area
of North America was covered by
seas the floors of which were form-
ed of sedimentary rock. About 2.7
billion years ago, a severe deforma-
tion of the crust of the earth oc-
curred. This upheaval created a
mountain range and turned the
sedimentary rocks into metamor-
phic rocks. A second deformation
occurred a billon years later and a
second range was formed. Finally,
only 70 million years ago, a third
orogeny produced the Rockies, which
now contain traces of the earlier
mountain ranges and the oldest rocks
in North America. These old rocks
are found in the core of the new
mountain belt and usually at high
altitudes.

This summer, Dr. Spencer is re-
turning to Montana with Phi Gams
Rick Belser and Richenbough Mc-
Williams to conclude his studies.
He will publish his final treatise
on hi sfinding in 1964.

Isolating OL-3-Methylcycyo??!

Hank Hawthorne, a Phi Delt and
of the W&L Law Review; Bob Shep-
present time on the synthesis and
isolation of selected carbynyl de-
rivatives of hydrazidomalonic acid.
The major purpose of the experiment
is to prepare a reagent for the reso-
lution of recemic carbonyls. He is
testing the reactivity of certain re-
agents and has prepared a few de-
rivatives. Under the tutelage of Dr.
Shillington, Hank will resolve one
particular chemical this summer.
Dr. Shilling assured the Ring-tum
Phi that he would present Dr. Cole
with a significant amount of DL-3-
methyleyclohexaliden - ehydrazoma-
lonate earl next fall.

Teaching Machines

A very interesting series of ex-
periments is being carried on un-
der Dr. Jarrard of the psychology
department. Milford Schwartz, a
senior pre-med, is studying vebral
learning. His work concerns the
programming of materials for use
in the new teaching machines. The
specific problem he is workin on
now is possible responses to the
the machine. Should a student be
compelled to answer a question
about which he knows (or has learn-
ed) very little? Or would such ran-
dom guessing forge deleterious pat-
terns in the students mind?

Drew Danko, a senior Phi Psi who
intends to continue his study of
psychology in graduate school, is
studying the learning process using
white rats as subjects. His research
based on a modern theory of

DuBose Chosen President
Of Commerce Fraternity

Thirteen men were elected to mem-
bership in the Commerce Fraternity,
an honorary society for those major-
ing in commerce and economics at a
meeting Wednesday afternoon. Quali-
fication for membership requires that
those initiated have at least a 1.5 av-
erage in their commerce subjects.

New members from the rising senior
class include Bob Lewis, Warren Mills,
Dave Benn, Louis Westfield, Peter
Agelasto, Carl Connell, and Rick Kurz.

From the rising junior class, Bill
Young, George Missbach, Bill Board-
man, Jud Babcock, Fred Baker, and
Howard Bing were selected for mem-
bership.

Also at the Wednesday meeting, Bo
DuBose, a PiKA rising senior from
Atlanta, Georgia, was elected as pres-
ident of the fraternity. He succeeds
Billy McWilliams.

Other officers elected for next year

Popular Eastern Group Noted

For Versatile Arrangements

Pat Dorn and his Orchestra, a popular group in the East,
but little-known on Southern campuses, has been signed to
play for Finals Dances. Dorn will perform at the formal dance
in Doremus Gym on Tuesday, May 31, from 9-1.

“Dorn and his group have made a sensational impact on

the college and society scene,” said Dance Board Vice-president
*Bob Bridewell.

The main reason for the Dorn
success lies in the balance and
smooth arrangements in the band,
according to Bridewell. It is not
unusual for the Dorn Orchestra to
be performing for a big debutant
party where the accent is on the
“two beat tempos or show tunes”
and then the next night play for a
college group favoring popular swing
or ballads, he said.

Observers say that Dorn has used
his many years in the music field to
effectively combine a big band sound
with a delicate balance for sweet,
soft listening and romantic dancing.
He has a solid brass section to en-
liven a dance with show tune fav-
orties. to insure possession of the
“sound” he wants by personal super-
vision of his music arrangements and
the maintenance of a large staff of
musicians. Dorn’s arrangers have
written into his performances the
styles and sounds of the “great
bands” so that on a Dorn engage-
ment the audience hears all their
favorites played by one band.

Washington and Lee is not new
to Dorn. During World War II he
attended the University’s special
service chool. In his class were such
famous entertainers as Mickey
Rooney and Joe E. Brown, son of
the comedian Joe E. Brown. After
his training on the Washington and
Lee campus, Dorn began producing
shows and dances and later traveled
to the Pacific to perform for United
States troops there.

At the close of 1945, Dorn decided
to accept a position in Japan rather
than return home on rotation. In
Toyko, Yokahama, and the moun-
regions of Japan he toured with a
band in a Japanese show.

Since his return to the United
States, Dorn has steadily built up a
large following. One of the highlights
of his recent college tour was a
performance at Yale, where he and
his orchestra accompanied singer
Roy Hamilton.

 

Wheeler Granted Leave
To Plan Encyclopedia

Dr. John Harvey Wheeler, profes-
sor of political science at Washington
and Lee, has been granted a two-
year leave of absence to take part
in formulation of a “master plan”
for future editions of the Encyclo-
pedia Britannica.

Dr. Wheeler will work at the Cen-
ter for the Study of Democratic
Institutions in Santa Barbara, Calif.,
a research center supported by the
Fund for the Republic, Inc.

Dr. Wheeler says the Encyclo-
pedia Britannica has contracted with
the center to provide a plan for
overall revision of future editions of
the world-famous reference work.

Dr. Wheeler described the project
as formulation of a “master plan,”
not just an editing or rewriting as-
signment. The first edition of the
encyclopedia embodying the new
concept which Dr. Wheeler and
others will devise is expected in 1969.

While in Santa Barbara, Dr.
Wheeler will continue to do research
and writing in political theory with
support from the Center for the
Study of Democratic Institutions.
The center has supported his work
in this area for several years.

Dr. Wheeler joined the Washington
and Lee faculty in 1954 as an asso-
ciate professor. He was promoted to
full professor in 1957.

Dr. Wheeler received his Ph.D.
degree from Harvard, where he was
an instructor in political science in
1949-50. From 1950-54 he served as
asistant professor of political science
at Johns Hopkins University.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

Talk’s Cheap, But...

A temporary truce has been declared in
the noisy war between the “torpid,’ or “‘con-
tented,” University Party and the Indepen-
dent Party. No issue of Protest has appeared
in over a week. Is our experiment in democ-
racy at an end?

We think not. There will always be a need
for more participation by students in their
own campus affairs. The past month’s enter-
taining spurt of polemics and demagoguery
kept us entertained with a sizeable amount of
hard work being left undone.

Now we are confronted with the disagree-
able tasks of forming the Assimilation Com-
mittee, the Cold Check Committee, and the

Student Library Committee. Somebody has
to be chairman of those erstwhile groups.

Whether the Ring-tum Phi is free, or not,
someone has to go out and get the news which
fills our columns.

Now they are talking about forming a
Dance Board advisory committee.

We wonder if there will be anyone left
for the Legislative Assembly. One thing is
certain—if more men cannot be found who
care enough about student government to
plunge in and work at the little jobs that have
to be done, then many of our politicians will
look very silly indeed.

A Great Stimulus

In its first year of operation, the Lee Re-
search Grant program has been very success-
ful. Seven Washington and Lee students will
join professors in presenting papers to the
Virginia Academy of Science meeting at VMI
this weekend.

Bill Buice and Bill Boardman, who were
outstanding competitors on the Eastern de-
bate circuit this year, were aided by Lee
Grants.

The program subsidized many other less
spectacular, but equally worthwhile, scholarly
efforts by students here. Associate editor John
Kirkley’s article today shows in detail just how
popular the program has been with both stu-
dents and faculty.

We feel sure that Dr. Capito’s generous
endowment has begun what will prove to be a
great stimulus to serious scholarship at Wash-
ington and Lee.

They May Have A Point

Jon McLin’s letter from Oxford points
out that the British have realized for some time
that we can’t try to “beat”? communism. We
are living in a revolutionary world and so far
it appears that we are on the losing end of it.

What American observers are finally be-
ginning to believe is that we must sell our own
revolution to the uncommitted peoples. The
United States, sooner or later, must take a
stand for individual freedom. However we
choose to define freedom, all of us must agree
that the government in Washington has sup-
ported a great many enemies of freedom in
our vain attempts to hold the line against

communism.

Freedom is still revolutionary. We must
be willing to demand it from the Francos, and
Salazars, and Chiang Kai-Sheks, if we do not
want more Cubas on our hands. We betray
our own concept of democracy every day.

The editorial Jon sent us from the Lon-
don Observer which is printed below describes
all too well our present state of mind. We will
be on the defensive around the world until we
change this attitude, and offer to the world our
own alternative to communism. It will be a bit-
ter business, but we stand to gain more friends
in the long run than we will lose.

London Observer Says U. S. Is Colonialistic

London Observer editorial for Sunday,
April 30, 1961:

It would be comforting to believe that the
Cuban adventure was an isolated blunder,
partly inherited from the previous Admin-
istration. But all President Kennedy’s speeches
and actions since then, and the reactions of the
American Press, suggest that this was not so.
The Cuban intervention sprang from a par-
ticular view of the world which the President
fully shares, which most Americans approve,
and which at present sharply divides the
United States from most of her allies and
from all the neutral nations.

To a far greater extent than they would
like to admit, our American friends are the
prisoners of an ideology almost as narrow as
that of the Communists and just as fervently
believed. His Communist ideology makes Mr.

Khrushchev believe that the Government of
the United States is run by Mr. Rockefeller
and that capitalists Powers will, ultimately,
always use force to protect their investments.
The American ideology equates capitalism
not only with freedom but very nearly with
virtue. The nationaliztion of an American
company by a small nation seems to most
Americans—though not, it is fair to add, to
the President—proof of political sin so ob-
vious as to require no further discussion.

To nearly all Americans, Communism is
an evil as absolute as Nazism or as murder,
and anyone who questions this dogma must
already be infected by the contagion. They
decline to notice any difference between Khru-
shchev’s Russia and Stalin’s Russia. They ig-
nore the case of Yugoslavia, where Commun-

Is Race War Beginning Now?

By VICTOR LASSETER

On a book rack in the local book
shop there is a volume entitled
Goddamn White Man unobtrusively
placed between The Conscience of a
Conservative and The Liberal Hour.
Because of its violent denunciation
of white man’s racial policy in colon-
ial Africa this book would not have
gone unnoticed ten years ago. Today,
after the national uprisings in
Africa, Goddamn White Man is only
another indication of a growing
world-wide conflict between blacks
and white. The book does not seem
ultra-radical or scandalous to us;
it is rather another sound of the
tocsin such as Alan Paton’s Cry, The
Beloved Country, written in 1948
as an indictment of South Africa’s
apartheid policy.

These social manifestoes, how-
ever, are rather tepid in contrast
to the boiling intensity reached by
some contemporary negro move-
ments. Here in America, for ins-
tance, we have the already notor-
ious Black Muslims, whose avow-
ed aim is to reverse, by any pos-
sible methods, the present racial
standards of the world. The Black
Muslims do not want racial equali-
ty; they want to dominate the whites

 

socially, politically, and economical-
ly, just as they feel the whites have
dominated them.

Some observers have pointed out
that the fanatical Muslims have
little chance of capturing support
of the moderate Negro majority in
America. Nonetheless, the violent op-
position of this group to all aspects
of white culture must be considered
as the direct result of the white
man’s policy of repression, discrimi-
nation, and segregation.

Even if we could achieve complete
racial equality within the next few
years the Muslims would not turn
to a policy of moderation; they do
not want to live under our system
they want to destroy it.

Other Negro groups in America
are willing to wait for progress:
the NAACP, the Atlanta student
groups, and certain groups in Phila-
delphia, and they are enjoying im-
mense success. The state of Georgia
is already having to face the distinct
possibility of integrated schools, and
Virginia’s private school plan seems
to be faced with extinction by the
federal courts.

In Philadelphia Negro ministers
have organized a large majority of
that city’s 750,000 Negroes in whole-

 

sale economic boycotts of firms
which refuse to hire Negroes in
white-collar positions. The effect of
their boycotts, or of their antici-
pated boycotts, has led such power-
ful companies as Coca-Cola, Esso,
and Atlantic Oil to hire Negroes as
clerks, truck drivers, and junior ex-
ecutives.

In one sense, the Negro is still
the “white man’s burden,” but not
in the sense of Kipling’s pious pater-
nalism. The rise of the African Negro
states is now a prime factor in world
freedom and world ideology. We
have created the racial problera by
our colonialism and by our domestic
discrimination; the Negro is the
white man’s burden in order to in-
sure, perhaps, our very survival.

British Newspapers Slam Kennedy Foreign Policy,
U. S. Ideology Over Fiasco In Cuban Intervention

By JON McLIN

Oxford, May 3—President Ken-
nedy’s honeymoon with the British
press ended abruptly as a result of
his actions in the recent Cuban re-
bellion.

The change is significant in view
of the warmth with which reporters,
editorialists and columnists have
regarded him since the fall elec-
tion campaign. During that time, and
indeed, in the first months of his
government, the British press re-
garded him so sympathetically that
even an American reader could not
complain about its lack of objectiv-
ity.

But the last two weeks British
papers have not hesitated to criti-
cize roundly his words and actions
with reference to Cuba. And this
attack has not been limited to the
Manchester Guardian, whose editor-
ials have been widely publicized in
the Washington Post and elsewhere
in the U.S.

In the London Observer, for ex-
ample, appeared last Sunday an edi-
torial entitled “Blinkers,” which
said: “The Cuban intervention
sprang from a particular view of
the world which the President fully
shares, which most Americans ap-
prove, and which at present sharply
divides the United States from most
of her allies and from all the neutral
nations.

“To a far greater extent than they
would like to admit, our American
friends are the prisoners of an ideol-
ogy almost as narrow as that of the
Communist and just as fevently be-
lieved.... This view of the world is
a dangerously over-simplified one.
... It would be a grotesque and dis-
abling consequence of an emotional
anti-Communism if the West, which

 

ought to be the pioneer of tolerance,
came to appear almost as intolerant
and blinkered as those it opposes.”

This editorial, which is printed in
full on these pages, is a trenchant
summary of the British view of the
way America conducts her foreign
affairs. Without commenting on this
over-all view—which contains an
uncomfortably large element of
truth—a few points may be made
about Cuba.

First, let it be said that criticism
of the U.S. has not been limited
to those who also condemned
Britian’s intervention in Suez. It
is true that the Guardian and the
Observer have been the most out-
spoken, and they were consistent
in opposing their own govern-
ment’s intervention in Suez.

But just as frequent are those
who criticize the action not on
moral grounds—for the British
have disengaged foreign affairs
from morality to a degree which it
would behoove us to emulate—
but on the grounds that it failed.

According to these realists, one
either commits an act of overt ag-
gression, with all the hostile opinion
which it engenders, and accomplish-
es his mission; or he refrains from
taking any action at all. But to make
a half-hearted attempt which will
not remove the “Castro threat” but
which nevertheless leads to great
public hostility and loss of face is
utterly fatuous.

Most people here cannot under-
stand the failure of Americans to
grasp two features of the leftward-
leaning governments such as Cas-
tro’s. First, the people of the coun-
try involved may genuinely support
the government, whether it be Cas-

tro, Lumumba, or the Pathet Lao.
(This lesson seems to have been
learned the hard way in Cuba when
the invasion failed to produce mass
defections to the rebels’ side.)

Secondly, though such leftward-
leaning Governments may not be
Communist, the Communists are glad
when the President and the State
Department brand them as _ such.
And so to identify them is often to
force them to take a stand and to
embrace more closely a Communism
which they deplore. This point was
made by Mr. Khrushchev to Walter
Lippman, on the latter’s recent visit
to Moscow. In words to this effect he
said “There will be uprisings in
other countries, and you will call
them Communist-inspired. And we
will be glad to have it appear that
the side of freedom and progress is
always the side of the Communists.”

No doubt there is great regret in
Latin America that what was to have
been a new and different policy of
the U.S. towards their needs has
turned out to be but a new form of
the old paternalism. The progress
which might have been made in
Latin American relations—the area
which President Kennedy called
“second in importance only to na-
tional defense’”—has been lost.

The sad capstone to the whole af-
fair, as viewed from Britain, is
President Kennedy’s request for a
self-imposed censorship by the press
of criticism of the government’s ac-
tions. To have made such a request
of a press which, in Europe as well
as the U\S., is already lacking in
objectivity toward his Administra-
tion seems a bit too much. National
unity is a grand thing, but to unify
in support of a mistaken policy can
be national folly.

 

Grad Grimley Still Going Great;
Dislikes Ivies! Still Loves W&L

By STEVE HENRY

Roy J. Grimley, class of 1921,
came back to Washington and Lee
last week for the reunion, You may
have seen him around campus, sport-
ing a ten gallon hat and new
Cadillac.

You were looking at the man who
is probably the most gung-ho alum-
nus ever to pick up a sheepskin at
this institution.

Mr. Grimley lives, breathes, and
dreams Washington and Lee.

We talked to him for three hours
in his room at the Mayflower—a
room brimming over with material
dealing with the university and its
founders.

He has Robert E. Lee lithographs,
Robert E. Lee letters, Robert E. Lee
etchings.

He has a woodcut of the university
made in 1845. Under a magnifying
glass, he showed us a flaw in the
cut, namely that the statue of old
George was off center.

He has a king-size copy of the
Washington and Lee stamp issued
in 1949.

In case you didn’t know it, and
we didn’t, Washington and Lee does
have a stamp all its own, a blue
and white job showing the colon-
nade and George Washington and
Robert E. Lee, all in one dose.

Mr. Grimley was personally re-
sponsible for the stamp.

Appointed a committee of one by
former W&L President Francis P.
Gaines, Mr. Grimley carried the
fight for the stamp all the way to
the hallowed floors of Congress.

After months of negotiations and
lobbying by Mr. Grimley, the stamp
appeared on April 12, 1949, the date
of the W&L bi-centennial celebra-
tion.

Mr. Grimley got ODK for that
little trick.

Dear reader, we hope that you are
beginning to see the light: Roy J.
Grimley is not APATHETIC.

“There are just two schools in the
country so far as I’m concerned,”
said he. “One of them is Washington
and Lee and the other isn’t.”

Mr. Grimley came to W&L back
in the good old days, say around
1917.

A self-styled “barefoot boy” from
Ridgewood, New Jersey, he backed
into Lexington on the B&O and
settled down for a college career.

Why did he come to Lexington in
the first place?

“Never had heard of any other
school except Washington and Lee.”

What did a W&L man do for kicks
in those days?

“Climbed House Mountain or
hiked to Staunton.”

Mr. Grimley told us of a trip he
and three classmates made to Wash-
ington to see a football game be-
tween W&L and Georgetown. After
a short hike from Fairfield to Staun-
ton Mr. Grimley and friends hopped
a train and made it to D.C. just in

 

time to watch the Generals pull a
major upset over nationally ranked
Georgetown. They made it back to
class on Monday “a little tired but
richer.” The odds were 20-1 against
W&L.

Oddly enough, Mr. Grimley be-
lieves that the present athletic pro-
gram is “for the better” even though
football “did W&L a lot of good.”

“Scholarships educated a lot of
boys who couldn’t have made it here
otherwise.”

“The scandals were a catastrophe,
but some people made a mountain
out of a mole hill. Everyone was
to blame that the thing happened in

  

Mr. Grimley and Gen. Lee

the first place, and not just the boys
involved.”

We skipped the subject before it
got too deep.

Asked about the social life in the
old days, Mr. Grimley recalled the
dance weekends.

“The girls would come in from all
over the country, dragging their
colored mammy’s and chaperones
with them. All the girls brought
trunks with them because they
needed a different outfit for every
occasion.”

How were the dances then?

“They were the big thing. We had
a stag line and people cut in when-
ever they felt like it. It wasn’t like
today when you shove one girl
around the floor all night until you
get sick and tired of her.”

Mr. Grimley especially remembers
one date he had with a chaperone

of two young things from Richmond. | ?

Her name was Wallace Warfield
then. You might have heard of her
as Wallace Simpson, who was
enough woman to make a man give
up a throne.

That was the party life in the
early 1920's.

We could hardly help mentioning
to Mr. Grimley the current wave
of call for change around the cam-
pus.

Excavation Could Be
Answer To Maypoles
Says Pacifist Craven

By THORNS CRAVEN
Former Friday Columnist

It seems that in all the changes
that have been taking place in the
print shop, swapping KA’s for SAE’s
and vice versa, I sort of fell in the
hole next door, and consequently
I didn’t make the Tuesday edition
this week with the rest of
the gang. Hence, I can’t say any-
thing too caustic about anything that
appeared this Tuesday, my name
being on the masthead.

But the Friday edition, while real-
izing that I am a bit of renegade
this week decided that it would be
unfair to deprive you of whatever
would have been in Tuesday’s paper
if I had known that I was supposed

_|to write. So the shortened title of

this is: “Words of Wisdom Written
on Thursday for Publication on the
Previous Tuesday, Going into Print
on Friday, Perhaps, or at least next
Tuesday.”

I think with a title like that there’s
hardly any need for the rest of the
column. And after reading a title
like that probably no one will read
anymore. I would apologize for this,
but the weather isn’t quite right for
apologies yet, and neither is the
hole in the ground behind the Law
School.

Just like Daylight Savings Time,

"| the hole presents a goud idea for a
_'|column. Unfortunately everyone in
| this school is a frustrated columnist,

and so all the wisecracks about the
hole have already been thrown in.
That’s what everyone is using their
extra hour doing this week, com-
menting on the whole thing. So far
no one has said that it represents
W&L’s answer to the maypoles at all
the girls’ schools, but we’re probably
better off that no one has.

Speaking of girls’ schools, or rid-
ing academies as Harvey Allen likes
to call them, there is something to
be said for them. So after refraining
all year, I'll say it: Hollins. That ful-
fills an obligation of mine, and also

W&L Still Getting Grid Talent,
‘61 Frosh Prospects Look Bright

By BOB BROWNE

Washington and Lee’s football
Generals, with experience and man-
power to spare, should remain on
the good side of the won-lost col-
umn in 1961,

After next year, what? There is a
solid nucleus of talent moving up
from this year’s freshman squad
which will complement a squad of
veterans including Tommy Keesee,

Tough Work—W&L Player Tries To Control Face-Off

 

Lacrosse Team Ends Season

At Charlottesville Tomorrow
By BARRY GREENE

Coach Bob McHenry’s varsity lacrosse squad travels to
Charlottesville Saturday hoping to spring an upset on the
heavily favored Virginia Cavaliers. The game will wrap up the

season for the Generals, whose
and eight losses.

record now stands at three wins

McHenry, who scouted UVa. in its 8-1 win over Wash-

ington University, called the Wahoos*

“one of the best teams in the coun-
try.”

“Virginia has lost to some of the
best teams, and has given every one
of the top-ranked teams a good
game. Right now I’d rank them sixth
in the States behind Navy, Hopkins,
Maryland, Baltimore and Army.”

Wahoo standouts include Henry
(Punch) Peterson, a possible All-
American, who ranks as UVa.’s best
attack man.

The Generals’ John Dinkel will
cover Peterson.

Virginia also has two top-rated
midfielders, Hi Levasseur and John
Stokerson. W&L’s John McDaniel
will defend against Levasseur and
Charlie Gummey or Steve Suttle
will try to hold down Storkeson.

The Wahoo’s best defenseman is
Goalie Booty Nice.

Both Storkeson and Nice traveled
to Australia with the combined
UVa.-W&L team in 1959. Three
other members of the UVa. squad
also made the trip, including Mid-
fielder Jay Taylor, Ken Sappington
and Don Spillman.

Long Year

This has ben a long year for the
Generals in lacrosse.

McHenry, apologizing for making
excuses, said that injuries hurt the
team more than anything else.

“We didn’t have the depth because
of injuries. You’ve got to have at
least one full field scrimmage a
week to get anything shaped up.
We haven’t had the men available to
hold these scrimmages. Last game
we only had 17 men suit up for the
game.”

The picture against UVa. is bleak.

In a pre-season scrimmage, the

 

 

Wahoos blasted the Generals 17-3.
Also, UVa. has performed much
better against the teams which both
they and the Generals have met. Ex-
ample: Washington University,

Mighty Davidson College needs
help.

The Davidson student body is ap-
pealing to outstanding Southern
Colleges and such top non-Southern
| institutions as the Colorado School
| of Mines for help.

The problem: The Davidson Col-
lege Executive Committee has
found it necessary to restrict Mr.
David N. Dakin, a talented young
soccer player, to this campus for
a two-week period for his ir-
responsible failure last Novem-
ber to return an athletic supporter
belonging to the College.

 

The delay in the Committee’s ac-
tion in sentencing this poor athlete
has been attributed to the lengthy
deliberation required for so serious
and costly a matter.

But is Washington and Lee
bringing in new talent with next
year’s freshman class?

“Yes, indeed,” smiled Coach Mac
this week, as he told a Ring-tum
Phi reporter about some of the hot-
test prospects moving into the W&L
camp next year.

From Frankfort, Ky., comes Hal
“Skipper” Chase. Chase, a six-footer,
who plays both end and left half-
back, was selected the Most Valuable
Player in the All Central Kentucky
Conference.

Martinsville High will send the
Generals a fullback and lineback-
er named Dan Mason, Mason, a
three-year letterman, weights 184
and stands 5’ 10”. During his three
prep years, Martinsville racked up
a 22-8-0 record.

 

Sports Barbecue
Monday At 4:30

The Washington and Lee Annual
Sports Barbecue will be held on
Monday, May 15, at 6:30 p.m. at
Captain Dick Smith’s farm, it was
announced this week by Athletic
Director Cy Twombly.

Varsity monograms and _fresh-
man numerals will be presented in
addition to various athletic awards
presented to outstanding perform-
ers in W&L sports.

Last year’s winners included
Karl E. Rohnke (most valuable
athlete); Phil Sharp (baseball);
Mal Lassman (basketball); Bill
Loeffler (cross-country); Bart
Dick (football); Terry Fohs (foot-
ball).

Also Jack Vardaman, Jr. (golf);
Jay Stull (lacrosse); John Morton
and James Head (rifle team); Frank
Smith (soccer); Elliott Maynard
(swimming).

Also Billy McWilliams (tennis);
Sandy Mersereau and Graham Ful-
ton (wrestling); Tab Bunkley
(track); Charlie Gummey (best
freshman athlete), Michael Apple-
field (lacrosse).

Rohnke won two other awards in
addition to his most valuable ath-
lete title. He was named winner
of the Winks Glasgow Award and
the Forest Fletcher Track Trophy.

The Class of ’62 has taken im-
mediate action and has set up the
“David Dakin Jockey Fund.” The
purpose of this fund is to defray
the losses sustained by the College
at the end of each soccer season
when players fail to return their
supporters.

Davidson is currently conduct-
ing its first annual Spring Fund-
Raising Drive. It needs your help
or its whole athletic program might
fail.

It seems that the weatherman is
the only person that can beat W&L’s
baseball team.

The Generals, who sport a 7-4
record, were prepared for a three-

the weatherman rudely knocked out
two of those games.

A Monday encounter with Ran-

loss to a win.

Perhaps the finest all-around per-
formance made by the golfers this
year came in the State Intercollegiate
Tournament at Hot Springs where
the Generals placed fourth in a field
of 12 schools.

The Generals, with Captain
Vardaman leading the way, shot
an aggregate team score of 632,
an average of less than 80 per 18

more difficult than usual by rain.

The Generals got outstanding in-

year from Vardaman, Couch, and

Lee, a first year letterman, had an
8-1 individual record in match play.
He also placed in the top 10 in the

learning and his primary purpose
is to support this theory by experi-
mental data. His rats are trained to
avoid being shocked by a diabolical
little machine. If the rats press a
bar at the right moment, they de-
lay the shock for ten seconds and
occasionally receive a food pellet.
Drew is trying to find out if hungry
rats learn how to get their food
faster than well-fed, contented rats.

“Hot” White Rats

Ken Kowalski, a PiKA sophomore,
is studying the effects of radiation
on white mice in connection with
Dr. Jarrard’s studies in the same
area. Dr. Jarrard has received a
grant from the National Institute of
Health to conduct this research. The
rats are first trained to escape
shock and obtain food. After their
performance becomes fairly stand-
ard over a period of time, they are
subjected to varying degrees of
radiation and their behavior is again
tested for change. These experiments
are very significant, especially in the
light of recent Russian discoveries
in the same field.

The Russians claim that marked
changes in behavior are produced
by very slight, often undetectable,
changes in radioactivity and that
functional changes come about in
body cells before the tissue itself
is affected by the radiation. The
present work in the upper regions
of duPont Hall is preliminary to a
later testing of possible drugs to
counteract the pernicious effects of
radiation.

Electromotive force measurements
and phase studies of a molten salt
system of KNO3, AgNO3, and
K2CrO4 fused in varying propor-
tions are being conducted by Dr.
W. J. Watt. The activity of the
Ag is studied in a solution of the
molten salts at different tempera-
tures and concentrations. The effects
of divalent CRO4 on the monovalent
Ag are to be correlated for applica-
tion to other similar reactions. Later
the solvent will be changed to
NaNO3. Dr. Watt has already done
work on such a system at Oak Ridge.
He is assisted by Jim Cone, a senior
pre-med.

exempts me from the draft.

Speaking of girls in general, I
want to make public one more little
fact about our dear old campus be-
fore I close my career as a Friday
columnist. As you have probably
noticed, the good old McCormick
Library has been the brunt of several
good jokes this year. But a little
known function of the worthy staff
of that edifice has escaped my notice
until now.

Did you know that they have an

McHenry Lauds Lacrosse
Team’s Performance; Sees

Hopes For Brighter Future

beat the Generals 14-3.

But McHenry, whose teams have
been known to upset Virginia be-
fore, is pulling for an upset.

“Virginia plays Army next week.
We hope that they’re looking ahead
and not thinking too much about us.”

McHenry praised the work of his
two captains, Hunter Tracht and
John Dinkel,
college lacrosse careers against Vir-
ginia.

“They've been fine captains. John’s
been terriffic on defense, and Hunt-
er’s given everything in the field.”

“No coach is happy when his team
| loses three times as many games as
it wins,’ McHenry said. “But in-
| juries hurt us a lot. We’ve got some
good men coming back next year.
Things look a lot better.”

 

 

Grimley Deplores Proposal

Ending Conventional Dress
(Continued from page 2)

The best response came when we
asked him his opinion on the aboli-
tion of conventional dress.

“They'll do it over my dead body.”

Why so?

“Because this is a school of gentle-
men. Gentlemen wear their jackets
and ties. It’s worth the discomfiture

We mentioned that there are many
fine schools where students do not
wear coats and ties.

“T've seen them all” said Mr.
Grimley. “I’ve seen Princeton, Har-
vard, Yale, all the rest, and I say
NUTS to them all.”

“I sent my daughter to Smith, and
when I went down there to see
her, all I saw was a bunch of dirty
girls. There wasn’t a pretty one
in the bunch. I'll tell you, this
sloppy dressing reflects a person’s
background.”

“Maybe you should have sent her
to Randolph-Macon,” we said.

“That would have been better.”

Had we not been burdened with a
quiz next day,

stories about the university and we
had time to catch only a handful.

U. S. Accused Of Colonialism

(Continued from page 2)
ists have created a society that is independent
of Russia and which appears to less impas-
sioned democrats morally no worse than the
capitalist societies of Franco’s Spain, Salazar’s
Portugal or Verwoerd’s South Africa. Few
Americans can conceive that a Laotian peasant
might genuinely prefer the Pathet Lao to
Prince Boun Oum, or that there is anything
except misery in the Soviet Union.

To this anti-Communist blindness which
seems to be almost universal in the United
States, the Democrats add a particular view
of foreign policy based on their own exper-
ience. It fell to a Democratic Administration
to lead the country against Hitler and to
suffer grievous disillusions in its dealings with
Stalin. The Democrats are still convinced that
they face (in Mr. Kennedy’s words) “‘a relent-
less struggle in every corner of the globe
that goes far beyond the clash of armies or
even nuclear armaments.”

Total war is ruled out by both sides, so that
“subversion, infiltration and a host of other
tactics steadily advance, picking off vulner-
able areas one by one in situations which do
not permit our own armed intervention.”
President Kennedy sometimes seems to believe
that destiny has chosen him to lead the forces
of freedom in a desperate attempt to stop
the rot by using the same methods, and that
anyone who will not back him is either “soft”
or an appeaser.

This view of the world is a dangerously
over-simplified one. Mr. Khrushchev makes no
secret of his conviction that Communism will
ultimately prevail and that he will always do
his best to help it. No one would deny that
Communist techniques are dangerous and
hard to counter. But Mr. Khrushchev also
knows that technique is not enough; that out-
side the areas where the Russian and Chinese

 

armies are dominant, Communism can succeed
only where the conditions favor it. The chief
of these conditions are well known to be pov-
erty, backwardness, feudalism and oppression;
but there are also external factors of great im-
portance.

In Eastern Europe, for instance, Com-
munism’s greatest ally is fear of Germany.
In the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin
America, it is anti-colonialism. By direct in-
tervention in would-be neutral parts of the
world, the West presses a still painful wound.
Admittedly, it takes strong nerves not to in-
tervene when a country is threatened by Com-
munist subversion, but it may be the right
course. If Britain had intervened in Iraq after
General Kassem’s revolution, Iraq would now
be Communist.

Until all colonialism has been ended and
forgotten, the Communists will have an unfair
advantage. In some of his speeches, President
Kennedy has revealed an understanding of
this and of the need to welcome and support
nationalist movements that wish to be neutral-
ist. One hopes that this is still the basis of his
policy. But it is impossible to reconcile this
with intervention in every little country that
seems to be flirting with Communism or with
his massive restatement of the Monroe Doc-
trine in Latin America.

It is only when the neutral nations are
convinced that the West is prepared to respect
their independence and leave them alone that
they will see the much greater faults of the So-
viet Union, which is bound by its own ideology
to deny freedom of choice to its own people
as well as to others. It would be a grotesque
and disabling consequence of an emotional
anti-Communism if the West, which ought to
be the pioneer of tolerance, came to appear
almost as intolerant and blinkered as those it
opposes.

You're needed... just as your father and grand-
father were. It’s an obligation that a lot of qualified
college men have to meet...that of serving your coun-
try, when and where you are needed.

And the Air Force needs college-trained men as
officers. This is caused by the rapidly expanding tech-
nology that goes with hypersonic air and space flight.
Your four years of college have equipped you to han-
dle complex jobs. You have the potential to profit
from advanced training...then put it to work.
There are several ways to become an officer.

First there is Air Force ROTC. Another program,
relatively new, is Officer Training School. Here the
Air Force commissions certain college graduates, both
men and women, after three months’ training, The
navigator training program enables you to win a
flying rating and a commission. And, of course, there’s
the Air Force Academy.

An Air Force officer’s starting salary averages out
to about what you could expect as a civilian. First
there’s your base pay. Then add on such things as
tax-free rations and quarters allowances, free medical
and dental care, retirement provision, perhaps flight
pay, and 30 days’ vacation per year. It comes to an
attractive figure. One thing more. As an officer, you
will become eligible for the Air Force Institute of
Technology. While on active duty many officers will
win graduate degrees at Air Force expense.

Why not contact your local Air Force Recruiter.
Or write to Officer Career Information, Dept.
SC15, Box 7608, Washington 4, D.C., if you
want further information about the navigator
training or Officer Training School programs.
