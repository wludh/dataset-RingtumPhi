McThenia Opposes Page
In Presidential Campaign

|

Uncas McThenia
Candidate for President

Qualifications

Andrew McThenia, a freshman law
student from Alderson, W. Va., grad-
uated magna cum laude from W&L
in 1958. He earned an M.A. in geolo-
gy from Columbia University be-
fore returning here to law school.

He is a member of Phi Beta Kap-
pa and the holder of a Menkemeller
scholarship in Law.

His student government experi-
ence here consists of service as vice
president of his senior class and of
Delta Tau Delta social fraternity.
He was a dormitory counselor.

He is a football letterman and a
member of Sigma.

‘| idency.

4 cus had decided not to put up
_|a candidate for president, McThenia

 

Late Friday it still appeared that
Rosie Page would be unopposed for
president of the student body this
year. Yet by Saturday afternoon
Uncas McThena, a 1958 graduate of
Washington and Lee who has re-
turned to the law school here, had
garnered the Independent Party
nomination and emerged as a strong
contender for the student body pres-

After the Independent Party cau-

decided that no candidate at W&L
should go unopposed. He talked to
some of his friends in the law school
and decided he would run against
Page.

Bob Ketcham told Bill Johnston,
the Independent Party chairman that
McThenia was going to run for
president and would like to have
the backing of the party. McThenia
was in the “Little Clique” as a mem-
ber of Delta Tau Delta here in his
undergraduate days.

Johnston called a meeting of the
Independent Party Saturday after-
noon at 1:30 to consider McThenia’s
candidacy and that of any other
candidates who wanted to run
against Page for president.

McThenia came out of the meeting
with the Independents’ nomination
for president of the student body.

Meanwhile, Grayford Gray, the
publisher of Protest, had come into
contact with McThenia.

Thus McThenia brought Gray and
his non-fraternity followers into the
Independent Party fold and picked
up the whole-hearted support of
Protest in the current campaign.

Gray, as of today, had not en-
dorsed any Independent Party can-
didates other than McThenia. How-
ever, he did throw a heavy majority
of the non-fraternity votes in last
night’s nominating convention to
Ketcham, the Independents’ choice
for chairman of the convention.

 

Psychology Department Opens
Modernized Laboratory Facilities
For Student And Researcher Use

By JIM HALEY

The new psychology laboratory
was officially opened last week by
Dr. William M. Hinton, head of the
department. Located on the third
floor of duPont Hall, the new lab
had a unique origin. This upper
floor of duPont had been left un-
finished when it was built, and was
planned for use only in the case of
overflow lectures and group meet-
ings. However, early this February
work began on the new psychology
lab. The main room, now measuring
50 feet by 30 feet, was finished, and
four individual research booths con-
structed.

Seeking more space, Dr. Jarrard
of the psychology department, came
up with a useful idea. He suggested
that the walls of the main room be
opened and auxiliary rooms added
under the eves of the building it-
self. These new rooms, although
each has a slanting ceiling, are spa-
cious and were constructed at below
average costs.

Also built were an operant room,
control room, and an animal room.
These last three rooms are the
scene of an important new phase of
research at Washington and Lee.

Early this year the Russians an-
nounced that they had discovered
that dogs, when exposed to slight
radiation, were changed with respect
to their nervous systems. This infor-
mation was completely contrary to
all previous research in the field of
radiation effects by American scient-
ists. Consequently, the National In-
stitute of Health awarded a grant to
Washington and Lee for research in
this field.

 

Glee Club Will Sing Wed.

Washington and Lee’s annual
Spring Music Concert will be given
tomorrow night by the Westhamp-
ton College Choir and the W&L
Glee Club. Both groups will present
their own repertoires for the spring
season.

The Glee Club will sing several
new numbers, including an arrange-
ment called “Tarantella,” which has
a Spanish rhythm. John Baker will
be featured in one of his solos from
the Faure “Requiem” as well as in
“Landsighting.”

\ : :
Thus, the mice can never receive

 

In the animal room, bathed in
blue-green light, are over 100 white
mice, who are used as subjects of the
research. Four of these animals are
placed each day in sound-proof
boxes in the operant room. Within
each of these boxes is a metal bar.
If one of the mice wishes to receive
a food pellet, he must push the
bar.

Two other sound-proof cages are
wired so that the. mouse must push
the bar in order not to receive an
“obnoxious shock.” In these second
cages the mouse will automatically
receive a shock if he does not push
the bar over a ten second interval.

the shock if they can realize that
they must push the bar every nine or
ten seconds.

The results of each mouse’s turn,
in the cages are recorded on a
machine, valued at over $2500. The
figures of shocks received, food pel-
lets given, and pushes of the bar
are recorded and studied.

This Saturday, the mice will be
exposed to radiation. The tests in
the cages will continue over a length
of time and the results will again be
studied. In this way, Dr. Hinton
and Dr. Jarrard will be able to meas-
ure the effects of the radiation upon
the nervous systems of mice.

This is one example of the numer-
ous and extremely important experi-
ments which can be carried on in
the new _ psychology laboratory,
which is now doubled in size as a
a result of Dr. Jarrard’s idea. Fur-
thermore, there is still room for
significant expansion, according to
Dr. Hinton.

The new lab offers Washington and
Lee students an excellent chance for
individual experimentation and re-
search, Dr. Hinton says. Many
schools in the South have equal or
better equipment available for grad-
uate students, but none for under-
graduates.

This opportunity will act as a
stimulant for work in the field of
psychology, Dr. Hinton hopes.

“This project represents a cul-
mination of a dream in that we have
quarters for better instruction in
psychology and can give our stu-

 

dents an opportunity for indepen-
dent research,” he said.

 

The schedule will be:

body offices.

 

Political Assembly

A special assembly will be held Thursday from 9:55
to 10:40 a.m. to allow members of the student body to
hear speeches from the candidates for president, vice presi-
dent, and secretary of the student body.

The special assembly was set up by the Executive
Committee of the faculty at the request of the student
body Executive Committee. The assembly, which is volun-
tary, was made possible by shortening classes Thursday.

Thursday, April 27

D— 9:10— 9:55 a.m.

Assembly— 9:55—10:40 a.m.
F—10:40—11:25 a.m.
H—11:25—12:10 p.m.

J—12:10— 1:00 p.m.

Kent Frazier, president of the student body, noted
that this assembly breaks precedent and that he is sure
that all Washington and Lee students will take advantage
of the opportunity to hear the candidates for student

The polls will open for voting immediately after the
assembly and remain open until 6 p.m. Thursday.

 

 

 

Party Platforms

This platform represents an aggre-
gate of the opinions of the Inde-
pendent candidates. There are minor
differences as to the degrees and me-
chanics of the following considera-
tions, however, this is the common
position upon which the Independent
campaign will be conducted. Each
candidate welcomes the opportunity
to discuss his personal views on these
considerations in more detail.

HONOR SYSTEM—The Indepen-
dent Party feels that any attempt
to codify the Honor System would
be to destroy its essence, reducing
it to a set of ineffective disciplinary
rules. However, some changes are in
order concerning the trial procedure
in Honor System cases: the student
presented with the option to with-
draw from school should be pre-
sented with the facts of his case
before he exercises his option; the
accused should be convicted by a
three-fourths majority rather than
the present two-thirds; and most im-
portant, the student body should be
constantly informed and exposed to
the Honor System, its procedure,
and its ramifications.

CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION—
The Independent Party also favors
an organized program for the re-
vision and reform of the Student
Body Constitution. It is anachron-
istic in many of its sections, its last
and very minor revision being made
in 1958. Under such a program a
concentrated and representative ef-
fort could be made, the results of
which would be presented to the stu-
dent body, perhaps in the form of a
Constitutional Convention.

POLITICAL REFORM—The Inde-
pendent Party firmly opposes any
forced realignment of the party
system. This would be the same car
under a different coat of paint.
However, it is this party’s feeling
that more than simply two names
be submitted for each position on
the campus election ballot. This
would allow a qualified candidate
(perhaps from a dissatisfied house)
to run without the present neces-
sary backing of the majority of the
houses in his party. It would give
the “little man” a chance and per-
haps show the power of the “po-
litically primed” candidate in his
real light. This is not designed to
destroy the political party system
but rather to revitalize it by sub-
jecting it to healthy competition.

ASSIMILATION COMMITTEE—
The Independent Party is in favor
of restricting the Assimilation Com-
mittee and conventional dress tra-
dition to the campus of W&L per se.
This is merely recognizing the exist-
ing fact that the rules are “over-
looked” on weekends, and that the
Assimilation Committee is over-
burdened in trying to enforce the
rules in all parts of Lexington in-
cluded in the city limits.

STUDENT CONDUCT—The Inde-
pendent Party also favors the con-
sideration of a responsible student
group to handle cases of social mis-
conduct. Such cases are now being
taken care of by a faculty group
in which there is but one student.
Such a group would be in close con-

The University Party Candidates
for the “Big Three” Student Body
offices (Rosewell Page, President;
Charlie Commander, Vice-president;
Bill Outman, Secretary) do herein
present their views on certain of
the basic questions which face the
present student generation.

HONOR SYSTEM

First of all, we believe that the
Honor System as it stands now is
basically sound. We feel that strict
codification would be harmful to
the system.

If elected, we intend to see that
every defendant be informed as to
the specific nature of the evidence
and charges against him; and that he
be adequately informed of his rights,
especially with regard to the option
and to public trial procedure.

In addition we feel that the meth-
od used to indoctrinate freshmen
into the system should be changed
so as to initiate in them a positive
spirit of honor rather than a nega-
tive fear of the system.

It might also be emphasized that
the Washington and Lee Honor Sys-
tem provides for a public trial in
which the accepted legal procedure
for a trial is followed. In the pro-
cedure for public trial provisions
are made for a prosecutor, counsel
for the defense, and a jury.

CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM

With regard to constitutional re-
form and amendment, we propose
that a committee of seven men, made
up of three Executive Committee
members and other student leaders
of all parties, to be appointed by
the Executive Committee to examine
the Constitution and to propose
those changes when they deem ad-
visable. This committee should hold
public hearings at which time mem-
bers of the Student Body at large
might make proposals for further
amendments. The findings of this
committee should then be presented
to the Executive Committee for dis-
cussion, and then to the Student
Body in the form of a referendum.

The present Constitution provides
that those sections of the committee
report which are ratified by the
Executive Committee would need
only a majority Student Body vote
for passage. The remainder of the
proposals would require a two-thirds
majority for passage.

In order to create greater partici-
pation, and therefore greater inter-
est in student government, we pro-
pose that there be formed a legis-
lative “Student Council” of approxi-
mately 50 members to be elected
from the Student Body in a manner
to be decided upon by the above
mentioned committee on Constitu-
tional amendment and legislative re-
form. Since the present Class officers
have no active function, the number
of class officers should form the basic
core of membership. The establish-
ment of such a council would en-
able approximately 50 more stu-

dents to participate actively in stu-|
dent government. This council would |

have the power to initiate legisla-
tion at monthly meetings. Two-
thirds of the Executive Committee
would be sufficient to veto resolu-
tions of this council.

Unique Nominating Convention
Sets Pace For Election Week

Last night’s nominating conven-
tion for the “Big Seven” offices con-
firmed the Independent Party-Non-
Fraternity Union alliance which has
taken shape in the last few days,
thus assuring the University Party of
a tight race in this year’s elections.

For the first time since the present
party lines were set in 1958, the In-
dependent Party was able to elect
the convention chairman. Bob Ket-
cham, a Lambda Chi, was elected
chairman of the convention, 72-71,
over University Party chairman
John Farmer. Voting for chairman
followed strict party lines and Ket-
cham won by virtue of a 19-2 split
in his favor among Non-Fraternity
Union delegates.

‘Treks To Give
Shaw & Chekhov

Presentations

By TOM LYBASS

George Bernard Shaw skilfully
dispelled the romantic aura sur-
rounding Napoleon in his first and
longest one-act play, “The Man of
Destiny.”

The Troubadours, continuing a
tradition of presenting only the most
challenging dramas, will perform
“The Man of Destiny” along with
another one-act play, “The Marriage
Proposal,” by Anton Chekhov May
7-12. Performances begin at 7:30
p.m. at the Troubadour Theater.

“The Man of Destiny” was writ-
ten for two reasons, the most im-
portant of which was to display
Shaw’s ideas on the “glorious” na-
ture of war. Another equally im-
portant motivation behind its crea-
tion, Shaw stated himself, “This play
is hardly more than bravura piece
to display the virtuosity of the two
principal characters.”

Only four characters appear in
the play. Dominating the stage as
he dominated the world is Napoleon
Bonaparte, portrayed by Tim Mor-
ton. Matching wits with his is the
other _ principal character, the
Strange Lady, performed by Jose-
phine Unger. John Dunnell and
Andy Adelson fill the supporting
roles which were designed by Shaw to
contrast with the character of Napol-
eon.

Playing an unheroic Napoleon,
Morton is cast in a role built for
an actor. In a sense, Tim is an actor
cast in the role of a man who is
an actor himself. Aware of the
subtlety of the character he plays,
Tim is working conscientiously to
portray the man whose success Shaw
believed was the result of faith in
the “efficacy of firing cannons at
people.”

The other principal character for
whom Shaw created his play is the
Strange Lady. The Strange Lady is
extraordinarily graceful and very
feminine. A possessor of a delicately
intelligent face, she is “all keen,
refined, and original.” Because she
had these qualities, Miss Josephine
Unger was selected for this role.

Miss Unger, who is an art teacher
at Southern Seminary, finds the role
challenging because of its diversity.

 

 

Uncas McThenia had emerged
Sunday as a belated Independent
Party nominee for president of the
student body, opposing Rosie Page.
The Independent Party had declin-
ed last week to nominate a candidate
for president, saying that “We de-
cided against nominating a student
for this position in light of the quali-
fications of the University Party’s
candidate. We know of no student
who would run against Rosewell
Page.”

McThenia nominated himself last
night in a brief speech in which he
threw jibes at the University Party’s
platform for being “three days late.”
He implied that the University Party
platform was drawn at least par-
tially from his ideas. “I want to do
something,” said McThenia, “like
perking up Springs weekend, may-
be a two-day jazz weekend, with
two modern and _ two. traditional
bands, or something like that.”

Ned Olds, nominating Rosie Page
for president, outlined the Univer-
sity Party platform: a committee to
look into constitutional reform and
the possible formation of a student
legislative assembly larger than the
Executive Committee, an affirmation
of the basic soundness of the honor
system, provision for better publicity
for the activities of the EC, and
sharp revisions in the policies of the
Assimilation Committee and _ the
Dance Board.

No other candidates were brought
before the nominating convention
than those of the two major parties:

Charlie Commander opposes Ray
Robrecht for vice president of the
student body.

Bill Outman opposes Steve Suttle
for secretary o fthe student body.
Jim Applebaum and Bill Ide op-
pose each other for president of
the Fancy Dress Ball.

Jim Russ and Jack Vardaman
oppose each other for president of
Final Dances.

Rick Frisbie opposes Charlie Mc-
Cord for president of Spring Dances.

And Danny Markstein opposes
Dave Montgomery for president of
Opening Dances.

The nominating convention was
generally solemn, with only touches
of wit coming out in the nominating
speeches for president of Opening
Dances.

Roger Paine, nominating Dave
Montgomery, noted that one of his
qualifications was membership in
the “Grand Order of Bacchanal,”
a mysterious organization all of
whose records were lost in the
“Great Buffalo Fire” at Forks of
Buffalo, Va. Paine called Mont-
gomery, who resembles a cherub
at times, “our back-to-the-womb
candidate.”

Carter Fox, poked fun at the ex-
haustive lists of organizations in
which some candidates were in-
included by their nominators when
he pointed out that Danny Mark-
stein, “although he is very religious,
is not a member of the University
Christian Association.”

Don Partington, nominating Jim
Applebaum for president of Fancy
Dress, drew some chuckles when
he described Shenandoah, of which
Applebaum is office manager, as
“the campus humor magazine.”

The Real Problem Is
RESPONSE—
Several Kinds Of It

Everyone—candidates and critics alike—seems to have
missed the point in the current furor. The problem is that the
student government at Washington and Lee is out of touch
with the needs and desires of a fast-changing student body.
Blame it on “apathy,” blame it on the system, throw the blame
anywhere you want—but remember that the fault falls nearly
equally on every member of the student body.

The present Executive Committee, the Dance Board, the
Interfraternity Council, the Assimilation Committee, and all
other holders of student body offices are at fault because they
have not had the courage, and the time, to face squarely and
bring to a decision the pressing questions they have been pre-

sented with.

Every student in the University is at fault because he has
not taken enough interest in these important questions to con-
sider what he wants and then demand a decision.

The Ring-tum Phi has not given thorough coverage to the
meetings which have discussed important questions. Our
columnists and editorials have aired many of them rather well,
but nowhere has either edition made it clear how something

can be done about them.

This lack of communication between W&L students and
their leaders was never more apparent than at last Wednesday’s
ill-fated Forum. To this observer it seemed that the nebulous
and inarticulate answers of the candidates were a direct result
of the nebulous and inarticulate questions posed them by the
panel. Yet the Friday edition was amazingly articulate in its
condemnation of the whole group.

Gentlemen, let’s not expect too much of our student lead-
ers. If we can’t decide what we want, we can’t expect our leaders

to decide for us.

We firmly believe that the only modifications necessary in
the student body constitution are ones which will provide for
regular presentation of all important issues to a larger segment
of the student body for review and guidance. At present those

means do not exist.

Thus

the issue which should dominate this election is

Responsiveness. At present we have a severe breakdown
in communications between the student government and the
student body as a whole. Responsiveness entails a responsibility
on the part of the student government to formulate plans for
the future AND a responsibility on the part of every student
to inform his leaders of what he wants done.

The ONLY revision of the student body constitution
which are in order at this time are one designed to remedy this
general lack of communication between student officers and
the student body as a whole. Any attempt to deal with more
specific problems will merely confuse the issue further.

Next. week, after the dust has settled from the “Big Seven”
elections, and everyone has partially regained their senses, the
Ring-tum Phi will present a summary of the most pressing issues
with which the new officers will have to deal.

Paul’s Proposals For Possible E

By JOHN PAUL

The novel feature of the student
body elections this year is the pres-
ence of real issues and the demand
on the part of many that the can-
didates reveal their stands upon
these issues. Yet, at the same time,
the student body, though no longer
indifferent, is not adequately aware
of the present situation to evaluate
the new proposals. There is a de-
sire for change and improvement.
Despite this ferment there have been
discouragingly few concrete, specific,
well-thought-out formulations of-
fered.

I should hope that no student
would desire to strike at the heart
of the honor system. That the
system is imperfect and vulner-
able can not be denied but the
spirit behind the system must en-
dure. It is the spirit of honor which
is distinctive to our campus and
it must be reverently maintained.

At the same time we must be

The Parable
Of The
Indian Agent

By STEVE HENRY

In case you haven't noticed, the
Washington and Lee Un-Apathetic
Activities Committee is up in arms
again, this time against the Big
Three candidates of both parties
for not presenting, of all things,
adequate platforms.

For some reason, this upheaval
among a minority of the student
body brought to our minds a few
memories of years-past high school
days when every election was either
won or lost on platforms—platforms
which undoubtedly would bring a
gleam to the eyes of all the angry
young men around here who are
currently pacing the campus walks
mumbling apathy, lack of initiative,
and, well, you know the rest.

We remember one _ particularly
exciting campaign for student body
president during which we heard
perhaps the greatest political speech
ever made.

It happened like this:

There were four students in the
race, at least three of whom were
anxious to add yet another honor
to their brimful high school records.
On the day before the election,
each candidate was required to state
his platform before an assembly of
the student body and faculty, this
obviously being the high point of the
entire campaign.

Came the day, and in filed the stu-
dent body to listen to its leaders
bid for each and every vote. After a
quick pledge of allegiance to the
flag, the time was nigh for politi-
cal history to be made.

Candidate one mounted the speak-
er’s stand and promised the follow-
ing: new water fountains, longer
lunch hours and more assemblies.
Thunderous applause greeted his
speech!

Candidate two promised not only
the promises of candidate one; he
added better meals, more study halls,
and an easier grading system. Even
greater applause!

Candidate three promised all that
the first two men had called for.
In addition, he swore that he would
provide new uniforms for all ath-
letic teams, abolition of final exams,
and authorized drinking at football
games. The auditorium shook with
applause. Surely this was the world’s
greatest platform—a sure-fire de-
terrent to student body apathy.

After the applause had died to a
ripple, the fourth candidate took the
stand, and here it was that we were
privileged to hear an address second
only to the one made at Gettysburg.

Here is the text of the address,
given to the best of our ability with
full realization that we can never
do justice to the words of the origi-
nal speaker.

“Mr. Principal, honored faculty,
and fellow students. My opponents
remind me of a story I once heard
about an Indian agent.

“This particular Indian agent used
to go out to the reservation and
call an assembly of the entire tribe.
Then he would begin making prom-
ises. Oh, he promised the Indians
everything—better treaties, more
land, more food, everything.

“All during his speech, the In-
dians would stand up and yell
‘Oompah’ at the top of their voices.
Every time the agent would make
a promise, the tribe would shout,
‘Oompah, Oompah.’ This made the
agent feel very good because he
was sure he had impressed the In-
dians with his talk.

“That afternoon, the agent was in-
specting the tribe’s buffalo herd
with an Indian guide. The two men
were walking along through the

be published. The freshmen should
be made well aware of the honor
system, the procedure, and the role
of honor in the Washington and Lee
community.

One final word as to the honor
system. Granted that honor is a
vague term, we must not succumb
to the temptation to try to formu-
late what falls within its scope
other than in general terms. The
honor system must not be codified
for if it is, it will lose much of its
value. Furthermore, honor must not
be overextended to cover activities
which in themselves are beyond the
proper range of honor.

Dance Set Problems

The EC of the coming year should
also make an effort to solve the
problem of school dances. These
dances should be designed to give
the student something in return for
his investment in his dance plan.
It would seem that students no
longer appreciate the formal dance

 

 

IP ‘Big Three’ Shows Bid For Law School

By HUGO HUGENBOOM

“We decided against nominating
a student for this position (presi-
dent) in light of qualifications of
the University Party’s candidate.”

Following this statement, the Inde-
pendent Party announced, through
Protest, the candidacy of a law stu-
dent for the office of president of
the student body. This results in
two of the top three nominations
in the Independent Party slate going
to law students. Although this is
extremely flattering to the law
school, and the men nominated are
fine men, there are some small
doubts. How was it that the Inde-
pendent Party could only find one
man qualified for the big three in
the undergraduate school and had to
go to the law school for the other
two?

There is a strong liklihood that
some may think that the
law students were nominated
in the hope of gaining one hun-
dred “sure” votes, and suspect
the Independent party of acting
from a purely power-grabbing
motive. In order to prevent this,
some sort of clarifying statements

 

ought to be made.

The wisdom of overloading a slate
with law students is also open to
question, since the law school com-
prises only one-tenth of the stu-
dent body in number and far less
than that in actual campus-wide ac-
tivity (which is as it should be).
Since the Executive Committee is
concerned with more than just hon-
or system offenses (and there are
three law school E.C. representatives
in any case), as for instance, legisla-
tion, fund allotment, etc., etc., law
school representation in the top
three offices of the University
should not be overwhelming.

Were the situation desperate, of
course, this preponderance of law-
yers would be justified. However,
the qualifications of the University
Party candidate for president are
too great to merit any “emergen-
cy” action.

Student Apathy Crushed

By ED WEBSTER

W&L students have gradually
lulled themselves into believing they
are apathetic.

Apathy as we know it, however,
is often nothing but an advanced
case of laziness. We just don’t care
to bother with time-consuming
things like thinking and acting.

Apathy is reinforced by a belief
that we can’t do anything anymore.
We fear that people won’t listen to
us, and that we will only make fools
of ourselves by presenting our ideas
to them.

This year, for the first time in
many years, apathy in campus
elections is being replaced by at-
tention to platforms and issues.
But the candidates might never
have taken a stand if a few
aroused students — probably less
than 25— had not refused to let
them ignore the numerous issues
of student government.

Futhermore, the university as-
sembly this week, at which the
six major candidates will present
their platforms, is largely the result
of a few seniors’ conviction that an
election without issues is a mockery.

The person responsible for much
of this new spirit, Grayfred Gray, is
still little known and largely mis-
understood by most of the campus.
However, many of the changes in
the honor system and the constitu-
tion, which are bound to come either
this year or next, will be due largely
to his prodding.

Many people are receiving a
startling revelation: they can con-
quer apathy merely by refusing
to believe in it. They must believe,
instead, in a cause, and must de-
vote themselves to that cause
through action.

For instance, when the SWMSFC
musical showed a deficit, most people
just shook their heads sadly. Gray,
however, sat at a desk on the colon-
nade for two mornings, collecting
money for War Memorial Scholar-
ships in a big jar. He got $54.36,
which is $54.36 more than anyone
else had thought possible.

The potentialities of students de-
voted to action, rather than to
apathy, were demonstrated by David
Riesman in the April Atlantic.
Changes in student government, in
cut system, or in the curriculum
could be urged, and probably achiev-

with the large band. The number
of these dances should be reduced
and jazz concerts, which the student
does enjoy, should be increased pro-
portionately.

Dances should be held in the
dining hall in order to afford a
more pleasant atmosphere. Finally,
of course, students should be al-
lowed to drink at dances. The re-
striction upon drinking at dances
has the implication that a W&L
student cannot drink moderately
and behave properly in public. I
feel that student responsibility and
maturity are great enough to
maintain gentlemanly conduct at
such an affair.

Further, I feel that the assimilation
committee powers and jurisdiction
should be revised. Conventional
dress should be required of stu-
dents, other than freshmen, only on
the campus. Freshmen should be re-
quired to wear conventional dress

 

 

ed, by a few students who are dis-
satisfied with the old methods. Ries-
man’s methods are extreme, but his
basic idea is worth listening to.

Campus conservatives shudder
when they hear words like “revi-
sion,” “change,” and “do something.”
They distrust people who are unwill-
ing to “go through channels.” Not
long ago, however, they were able to
hear Barry Goldwater speak here
largely because a few students and
professors were dedicated to the
idea that Goldwater should speak
here.

(Speaking of conservatives, why
are they so silent now at W&L?
We thought they always preached
things like “decentralized govern-
ment” and “individual rights.”
Are not these central issues in the
present controversy over student
government? Can campus conser-
vatives defend the student Execu-
tive Committee on the same
grounds that they condemn the
Supreme Court, the ICC, and the
FTC?)

This campus is far from perfect.
It will be made better only if peo-
ple think about the issues, formu-
late their beliefs, and act in ac-
cordance with these beliefs.

Such an approach does not require
mass support; it can be achieved by
a handful of dedicated individuals.
One person, in fact, might change
the whole nature of the campus.

 

idle analogies of organisms and
student body constitutions was
within the purview of the Execu-
tive Committee at all, that is the
one suggesting that more than two
candidates be permitted to run for
any single office. And that proposal
didn’t go into the full ramifications
of the matter: run-off elections,
“gag” candidates and other prob-
lems which would accompany this
“reform.”

The proposal that would establish
a student committee to deal with
student offenders is entirely under
faculty control and could only be
approved by them (and in light of
their recent actions has the appear-
ance of pie in the sky.) The other
ideas, formation of political societies,
have merit but do not add to a
solid political platform. They sound
good but like mother and apple pie;
everyone’s for them, but let’s get
on to other things.

No one can or should quarrel with
Uneas’ decision to run. We can only
wish that the whole matter had
been judiciously considered and ex-
plained, rather than having been
thrust upon us in what appears to
be the guise of a naked political
maneuver.

Debaters Attend
New York Meet

W&L sent four debate teams to
compete with nine other colleges
and universities at the Randolph-
Macon Novice Tournament held at
Ashland, Va., on Saturday. Bill Noell
and Fred Cooper upholding the Neg-
ative of the question: Resolved That
the U.S. Should Adopt a Program of
Compulsory Health for All Its Citi-
zens, was the only Negative team to
go undefeated, winning all four of
its debates. Noell further finished in
a tie for third place out of a field of
44 debaters. For Cooper this was his
first college debate. Others debating
for W&L were Bob Doenges, Dick
Kelley, Hunter Manson, Bill Tedards,
Tom Lybass, and Mike Levin. Senior
debaters Otis Hess and Pete Straub
went along to serve as judges.

This weekend W&L will send its
first string to New York City to
compete with Middle Atlantic and
Ivy League schools at N.Y.U. Bill
Buice and Bill Boardman will de-
bate the affirmative of the above
question, while Al Eckes will join
with Noell on the negative. The fol-
lowing weekend the season will end
at Columbia, S. C., at the Atlantic
Coast Conference Championship
Tournament. W&L’s affirmative team
will reman the same, but Jay Clark
and Richard McEnally will debate
the Negative. Buice, Board, Eckes,
Noell, Clark, and McEnally have all
received awards of excellence at var-
ious tournaments this year.

Academic Interest Needed

Finally, the student government
should take a more active interest
in promoting the academic status
of the University. Again perhaps the
EC should appoint a committee to
investigate the possibilities in this
field. Or perhaps the committee
should be a joint faculty and stu-
dent undertaking. The University
should do away with forced atten-
dance at all but University assem-
blies. The present practice of some
professors padding the turn out for
speakers sponsored by their depart-
ment wilts the intellectual interest of
the coerced student and is in itself
an insult to the speaker. Further,
steps should be taken to do away
with the use of cold quizzes by some
of more sluggish professors. The cold
quiz is harmful to all students in
that it destroys a zeal for true

 

 

 

 

lection Platform

learning. It is especially harmful
to the non-fraternity man to whom
the cold quiz files are not available.

Ultimately, the student body
should take concrete steps in do-
ing away with the archaic cut
system. To do away with the sys-
tem would improve the academic
community in that professors
would be forced to improve upon
their lectures to insure attendance
and the interested and industrious
scholar would be rewarded where-
as the dullards would soon be
culled out by their own non-par-
ticipation.

Taken collectively these sugges-
tions may seem rash; taken individ-
ually I feel they are not. It is my
belief that these proposals, if acted
upon, will benefit the school. We
must elect leaders with intelligence,
energy, dedication, and vision to
to see these proposals given ade-
quate treatment.

‘Carolina Tour’ Scoreboard
WE&L 9, 3; NC 2; Duke 6

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
team returned home from. their
“Carolina tour” Sunday. The Gen-
erals had registered a 9-2 victory
over the University of North Caro-
lina on Friday, while bowing to
Duke’s Blue Devils by a 6-3 score
on Saturday. Coach Bob McHenry
spoke with mixed emotions about
his team’s play this past weekend.
He seemed delighted with the fine
showing some _ individuals have
made, but for the most part was
critical of the lack of team hustle
and _ spirit.

The Generals did extremely well
in the game with the Tar Heels,
scoring four goals in the first half
to one for the opposition, and adding
five more in the second portion of
the game. Coach McHenry was
pleased with the performance of
most of the ballplayers in this game,
especially since the team was only
carrying eighteen men. Jimmy Pow-
ers was the big man for the Gen-
erals in this contest, scoring four
goals. John McDaniel and Hunter
Tracht each scored two, and Bill
Spencer-Strong added one more.
Herb Tinley, starting goalie for
Washington and Lee, had only five
saves, although he only played in
the first half. Noonan had no saves
and “Red” Rankin had five in
the second half. Last year the Gen-
erals battered North Carolina by a

 

11-5 score, and Friday’s game was
certainly a credit to the team.

McHenry was much less satisfied
with the Saturday performance
against Duke. Against a team con-
sisting of relatively the same calibre
boys the Generals beat last year
13-3, McHenry was obviously dis-
appointed with the loss. The Gen-
erals were able to muster only three
goals in the entire game. The Blue
Devils led 2-1 at halftime. Hunter
Tracht, Jimmy Powers, and Charles
Gummey each scored one _ goal.
However, the entire offense took
only 13 shots in the first half and
a total of thirty for the game. Coach
McHenry felt that the loss could
be attributed for the most part to
poor ball control, poor clearing, poor
offense, and poor riding.

On the agenda for this coming
weekend will be Johns Hopkins in
a game which will start here at 2:30
p.m. Saturday. Hopkins is current-
ly the nation’s number one team,
and is expected to wrap-up the na-
tional title in the next few weeks.
Hopkins will play Loyola tomorrow,
a team which lost to W&L by a
14-6 score. Few definite plans have
been made for the Generals’ strategy
in the contest. Coach Bob hopes to
gain more ball control in order to
cut the Hopkins’ scoring punch.

Frosh Take 6th At ‘Pilot’ Relays

Due to a cancellation in last Fri-
day’s freshman meet, track activity
was held to a minimum for the
Generals last week. The only varsity
activity was the victory over the
neighboring Hampden-Sydney team,
and the only Brigadier action was at
the annual Freshman Relay in Nor-
folk sponsored by the Norfolk Vir-
ginian Pilot newspaper. Washington
and Lee only had one team entered
in this relay carnival, and it came
home with a disappointing 6th place.
W&L was nosed out by the VMI con-
tingent by a stride. The four fresh-

men that ran were Ed Croft, John |

Pearson, Fox Urquhart, and Skip Es-
sex. Essex had an outstanding time of

 

50.9 sec. for his leg of the race. The
team’s time was 3:34.

In addition to today’s meet with
Lynchburg, the Generals will travel
to Philadelphia Friday for Satur-
day’s annual Penn Relays. Instead
of W&L competing against some of
the big time track schools, the teams
will be grouped according to their
ability and accomplishments thus
far this season. With such an ar-
rangement, the Generals can expect
to have a real chance to come home
with some prizes.

On Friday afternoon at 3:45, the
freshmen team will meet with the
Greenbrier Military squad on Wilson
Field.

Baseball Team Improves
Last Year’s Poor Showing

By HARRY MEEM

The W&L baseball team seems to
have taken on new life this year,
rebounding off last year’s 3-16 rec-
ord. Part of the credit must go to
the hitters who are providing more
punch at the plate, but a good deal
must also go to the pitchers.

Carpenter’s Record

Senior Roy Carpenter leads the
mound staff with a record of two
wins against two losses. In five ap-
pearances, Carpenter has pitched
twenty-three innings, both in start-
ing roles and in relief. He’s given up
nineteen hits, including two doubles,
one triple, and two homers. He’s |
walked seven, struck out nineteen,
and carries an earned-run average
of 3.91. His longest stint to date was
eight innings pitched in relief against
William and Mary, a game which he

inning.

Junior Phil Sharp is the other
mainstay of the staff. Sharp, who
beat Harvard and lost to Bridge-
water, carries an ERA of 1.78, off
five earned runs given up in twenty-
six and a third innings pitched.
In the four games he’s appeared in, |
Sharp has given up twenty-six hits,
walked nine, and struck out twenty-
one.

The mound corps has received an
added boost from freshman right-

 

hander Penn Way, who looked good
in relief of Sharp in the Generals’
contest with Norfolk William and
Mary. Way pitched three and a
third innings in this one, and, though
he needed help from Carpenter in
the ninth, got credit for the win. He
also looked good against Bridge-
water, once again in relief of Sharp.

Frosh Gamber

The other loss chalked up against
the Generals was hung on fresh-
man southpaw Brice Gamber by the
Mountaineers of West Virginia. In
this contest, a seven inning affair,
Gamber gave up three runs while

' walking four and striking out four.

He looked good in defeat, and should

| give the staff an added boost as

the season goes on.

Washington and Lee’s tennis team
came off the weekend road trip with
a 1-1 record. On Friday, Randolph-
Macon slipped by the netmen 5-4,
and Saturday saw the Generals
bounce back to a 7-2 victory at
Richmond.

The absence of third man Clark
Valentiner from the Generals’ line-
up hurt their cause considerably
and may well have cost them their
loss. After splitting the singles 3-3
the Generals forged ahead with
Captain McWilliams and John Bak-
er turning in their best performance
of the year. They were matched
against one of the top doubles teams
in Virginia in Cotton Cobb and
Warren Denby.

Split sets came up again in the
number 2 and 3 doubles and en-
thusiasm was dampened and temp-
ers shortened by a rain storm that
all but flooded the courts. Ran-
dolph-Macon swam to victory in
the last sets of both doubles
matches.

Mell, Mills, Smith and Wilbourne
combined their efforts to lose 6-4
and 12-10.

John Baker played his best singles

core 1-1 In Weekend Trip

match of the year defeating Cotton
| Cobb, an old high school rival. The
| Macon stalwart was trounced 6-2,
6-3.

McWilliams turned in an outstand-
ing performance despite a bruised
cartilage.

The Generals showed their true
form on Saturday when they
slaughtered the University of
Richmond, 7-2. McWilliams set
an example for his cohorts by win-
ning despite his injury. Mell and
Baker also glided to easy victories.

This afternoon the Generals take
the court against William and Mary
which was expected to be the tough-
est match this year. Next Friday
W&L meets a real “watch-out” team.
Roanoke, though considered one of
the easier teams on the schedule in
the past, has gained some top play-
ers and could easily upset the top-
seeded Generals.

There will be an intrasquad soc-

A ROBE BY ANY OTHER NAME

As Commencement Day draws near, the question on everyone’s
lips is: “How did the different disciplines come to be marked by
academic robes with hoods of different colors?” Everybody —
but everybody—is asking it. I mean I haven’t been able to walk
ten feet on any campus in America without somebody grabs my
elbow and says, “How did the different disciplines come to be
marked by academic robes with hoods of different colors, hey?”

This, I must say, is not the usual question asked by collegians
who grab my elbow. Usually they say, “Hey, Shorty, got a
Marlboro?” And this is right and proper. After all, are they not
collegians, and, therefore, the nation’s leaders in intelligence
and discernment? And do not intelligence and discernment de-
mand the tastiest in tobacco flavor and smoking pleasure? And
does not Marlboro deliver a flavor that is uniquely mellow, a
selectrate filter that is easy drawing, a pack that is soft, a box
that is hard? You know it!

  

Usados Gate! terval Ge?”

But I digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes.
A doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears
green, a master of arts wears white, a doctor of humanities wears
crimson, a master of library science wears lemon yellow. Why?
Why, for example, should a master of library science wear lemon
yellow?

Well sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to
March 29, 1844. On that date the first public library in the
United States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.
Sigafoos’s neighbors were of course wildly grateful—all, that
is, except Wrex Todhunter.

Mr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both
men had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had
chosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.
Sigafoos knew all the latest steps, like the Missouri Compromise
Mambo, the Shay’s Rebellion Schottische, and the James K.
Polk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all
owing to a wound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans,
(He was struck by a falling praline.)

Consumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos’s
library, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library.
This he did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr.
Sigafoos. “What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven’t got?” Mr.
Todhunter kept asking himself, and finally the answer came to
him: books.

So Mr. Todhunter stocked his library with lots of dandy books
and soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.
But Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began
serving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. There-
upon, Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea
with sugar. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with
sugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter began serving
tea with sugar and cream and lemon.

This, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter be-
cause he had the only lemon tree in town—in fact, in the entire
state of North Dakota—and since that day lemon yellow has of
course been the color on the academic robes of library science,

(Incidentally, the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his library
and moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There
were, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but,
alas, there was no cream because the cow was not introduced
to California until 1931 by John Wayne.) © 1961 Max Shulman

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Candidates’ Letters

Editor Tuesday Edition
Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

I would like to state my reasons for
running for President of the Student
Body and call the attention of your
readers to the platform offered by the
Independent Party, wherein are con-
tained the major issues upon which I
stand. I welcome the opportunity to
expound on these proposals through-
out the week.

I have become an active candidate
for the Presidency for the reason that
I believe I have a tangible and worth-
while program to present to this Uni-
versity. At the risk of seeming boast-
ful, I would like to state that I believe
my qualifications are indicative of my
ability to assume the position and to
fulfill its duties in a competent man-
ner. I do not run in answer to any
overwhelming call from the people,
nor do I run as a sacrificial lamb. I
run to win and with the hope of serv-
ing this school to the utmost of my
capability if chosen by my fellow stu-
dents.

It is my feeling that there is room
for a great deal of change in our com-
munity. The changes I would pro-
pose are not revolutionary but they
are, I believe, desirable.

There are certain areas in which
I perhaps differ from my running
mates. I would propose that the Uni-
versity reexamine its policy concern-
ing absense regulations and the policy
of requiring captive audiences at as-
semblies. It is believed that these prac-
tices as they now exist tend to stifle
true intellectual curiosity. There are
other areas in which my campaign will
be perhaps more personal than the
general party platform.

I wish to express my appreciation
to the Independent Party for endors-
ing my candidacy. I am indeed proud
to run on the same slate with the oth-
er Independent Party men.

Sincerely,
ANDREW W. McTHENIA, Jr.
+ * +

To the Student Body:

I offer myself as a candidate for
the presidency of the Student Body,
because I believe that the proposals
contained in the platform of the Uni-
versity Party are in the best interests
of the student body and the student
government of Washington and Lee
and because I believe that I am both
qualified and capable to see that these
proposals are carried out.

I intend to discuss my stand on the
various issues of this campaign before
the voluntary assembly to be held
in Doremus Gymnasium on Thurs-
day and in the various dormitories and
fraternity houses between now and
that time.

I solicit the vote of the entire stu-
dent body regardless of political af-
filiation. I ask only that the voters
consider carefully the issues at stake.
I feel that the planks of our platform
speak for themselves.

To the Student Body:

In this newspaper you find the plat-
form of the two opposing parties. They
are quite similar. There are definite
proposals, ideas and suggestions which
both parties agree on. This is largely
due to the fact that there was no talk
of platforms, etc., as such until about
a week ago. There has not been time
for lengthy and deep consideration of
all possible issues or proposals. The
proposals made by both parties are a
good step in the right direction. How-

ture, there can be no real distinction
between candidates based on party
platforms. Thus, you the student body,
are faced with the task of selecting
the most qualified men to carry out
these proposals as well as to sit on
cases involving the Honor System.

I am running for vice-president of
the student body because I feel I am
qualified to sit on the E.C. and that
I could capably fulfill the duties of
the president in his absence. I have
served as president of my fraternity,
head dorm counselor for two years,
and am currently on the E.C. I feel
that all three of these positions indi-
cate my willingness and ability to as-
sume positions of responsibility. Thus
I feel that I am more qualified than
my opponent. I subscribe to the basic
ideas laid down in the Independent
Party platform and will elaborate on
several of these ideas at the assembly
on Thursday. I hope all of you will be
there.

Sincerely,

RAY ROBRECHT

* * *

To the Student Body:

As a candidate for the office of
vice-president of the W&L student
body, I have entered this race to
win so that the attitudes of the entire
student body will be known and ad-
hered to by the E.C. In conjunction
with my University Party running
mates for the offices of the student
body, I have attempted to include
my views in the platform printed in
this paper. This platform is by no
means perfect or complete. There are
many other valid proposals and
changes to come. I feel that this is
a substantial start, but I also encour-
age suggestions which any person
might make.

It is my feeling that our attitude to
lead the student body in reorgani-
zation and revision of the student goal
is very sincere. We feel capable of
performing this leadership, and we
hope that we will have that oppor-
tunity.

CHARLIE COMMANDER

* * *

To the Student Body:

The current interest which has de-
veloped concerning the coming Stu-
dent Body elections represents what
I believe to be one of the healthiest
attitudes that we have been subject
to as members of W&L.

In support of this current interest,
I feel that the proposals that we as
University Party candidates have sub-
mitted in today’s edition of the Ring-
tum Phi offer for the Student Body
the soundness in planning and the
firmness of decision that will per-
petuate this interest in the coming
year.

It is my feeling that the current
student generation desires to be rep-
resented by candidates who have
more to offer than the interest which
all the candidates naturally possess.
Experience has better enabled
the University Party candidates to
meet next year’s problms; to initiate
change in those specific areas need-
ing immediate attention, and _ to
strengthen those principles which the
Student Body feels to be essential to
Washington and Lee.

Dear Sir:
In response to the comments and re-

ever, since they are so similar in na-

forum held last Wednesday evening,
I should like to present some specific
points and thoughts pertaining to the
major issues at the meeting. In doing
so, I shall be side-stepping some of
the important and very real matters
which, I am sure, are uppermost in
the minds of the student body at
W&L and which are most relevant to
the functioning of the executive com-
mittee i.e, the integration of W&L
and the instatement of an ideal Athen-
ian democracy on campus.

I am concerned, however, as to the

extent with which the average W&L
student is acquainted with his gov-
ernment and its institutions. To cate-
gorize briefly, my major support and
dissent fall within sections of the
Honor System and the executive com-
mittee.
I support the Honor System per se
as it now stands, for as I shall ex-
plain in a moment, any action may be
appealed or rescinded without much
effort by a small minority. However,
my specific grievance lies in one phase
of the trial procedure. I feel that it
is only fair that the accused should
be presented with the charges against
him before the trial. I do not favor
the idea that the accused should be
convicted by a unanimous vote of the
Executive Committee. Perhaps a
change from a two-thirds to a three-
fourth majority for conviction would
be wise. This would provide for two
arguments: first, the question of the
guilt of the accused would be negli-
ble—much more so than in the U.S.
Supreme Court which requires a sim-
ple majority for its decisions— and
second, it would provide for those
E.C. members who dissent merely be-
cause they have in their personalities
the hesitation to enforce such a pen-
alty in the light of the effect that it
would have on the accused and on his
life afterward. The latter may not feel
that the dishonorable action merits the
consequences. There are, in my opin-
ion, no degrees of honor in our sys-
tem. To admit such would invite cha-
os. Where would one draw the line
as to the degree of honor which was
abused? Again, as I said in the forum,
I feel that many anticipated honor vio-
lations can be dispensed with before
they arise simply by asking a professor
or an E.C. member. A step forward
in this direction was taken by the
E.C. when it published its views on
the mail-order encyclopedia question
recently.

The cry that the executive commit-
tee is invested with an excess of pow-
er has rung out and will undoubtedly
be heard again before the week is
done. Here I fail to take the dis-
senters’ stand because the students of
W&L are the holders of one of the
most powerful and most representative
vetoes in existence. This veto can be
brought about by fifty signatures from
the student body. Such a petition can
result in the rescinding of ANY ac-
tion taken by the E.C. Again, here
is the need for an informed student
body. If the executive committee
would take the initiative to provide a
fuller understanding of the student
government at W&L, many problems
would disappear in the light of this
knowledge of affairs and administra-
tion. Apathy would yield to action.

These are a few of the major prob-
lems as I see them and some proposed
solutions. There will be many more in
the coming year. The men elected
must not only be capable, but must
be willing to give their effort and ini-
tiative to such matters. These men will
be the representatives of the student
body— elected not to assert the power
placed in their trust, but to serve with
it to the best of their ability.

Hence, the Executive Committee
would maintain its position at the
head of the Student Government
with the power to interpret the
Constitution and the Honor System.

ASSIMILATION

We propose that the punitive pow-
ers of the Assimilation Committee
be increased, and that Conventional
Dress not be required off the cam-
pus proper after 6 p.m. on weekdays
and from 1 p.m. Saturday, through
Sunday night.

In conclusion, we propose to in-
from the Student Body of the week-
ly business of the Executive Com-
mittee, so that the students being
aware of the problems before the
Committee may express their opin-
ions on pertinate issues. We feel
that this might best be accomplish-
ed through the varied student news
media of the University.

“John Hopkins has two of the best
coaches in the country, says Mc-
Henry, “and should be really
tough.”

After the Hopkins game, Saturday,
only two more games will remain.
Both are away contests, one at
Washington College in Chestertown
on May 6, and the final game at
U.Va. on May 13. The Generals lost
to both of these teams last year by
substantial scores.

The starting lineup for Saturday
will be: Goalie—Herb Tinley; De-
fense—John Dinkel, Bill Wheeler,
and Bart Mitchell; Milfielders—Steve
Suttle, Terry Fohs, and John Mc-
Daniel; Attack—Charles Gummey,
Jimmy Powers, and Hunter Tracht.

And that was the end of the
speech, and the end of candidate
number four as a political aspirant
at our school.

(A word of caution for the wise:
do not spend over 10 seconds look-
ing for a moral or political analogy
in this column, because you may
be sorely disappointed. Of course,
anything you want to read in is okay
with us.
