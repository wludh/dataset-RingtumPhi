Blood Drive Has
125-Pint Quota

(Ed. note—the editorial staff of
the Ring-tum Phi joins in the plea
for student participation in the
Blood drive program. It doesn’t
hurt a bit, and—trite though it
may sound—a pint of blood could
save your life.)

A quota of 125 pints has been set for
the Spring blood drive which is
scheduled for Wednesday, March 8,
in the Student Union, John Mullin,
the campus drive director announced
today.

And R. J. Carlson, director of the
drive for Lexington, says the school
should produce 200 pints—to make up
for past deficiencies. The highest
ever collected here in any recent
drive is 80 pints.

The blood drive, Carlson says, is
a community project and makes
possible free blood transfusions for
all residents of the Roanoke Blood
Bank area, including non-per-
manent residents such as W&L
students.

The drives at VMI had been hav-

Sit-In Student
On UCA Panel

The University Christian Association
has announced that Miss Rebecca
Owen will be a member of the panel
which will discuss the sit-in issue in
the Student Union Tuesday at 7 p.m.

Miss Owen, a student at Randolph-
Macon Women’s College was a par-
ticipant in the six-member sit-in at
the Patterson Drug Store in Lynch-
burg, in early February.

As a result of her participation she
served an eleven-day jail term.
She is an honor student majoring in
religion.

Other members of the panel to dis-
cuss the sit-ins will be Dr. Louis
Hodges, of the W&L Department of
Religion, and law students John Paul
and Hugo Hoogenboom. Hodges will
speak on the historical aspect of the
movement while Paul and Hoogen-
boom will discuss the legal technical-
ities.

Moleolm Brownlee, UCA president,
emphasized that the discussion will
be an examination of sit-ins rather
than a promotion or a debunking of
them. He said, “The UCA as a body
has not reached agreement on this
subject, but we believe an examination
of it is necessary. There will be ad-
vocates of the conservative point of
view on the panel, as well as advo-
cates of the liberal point of view.”

3 English Seminar Speakers
Include Poet, Critic, Director

By ED BOKEE
Staff Reporter

The names of the 36th, 37th and 38th
Seminars in Literature speakers were
announced today by Dr. Ross Borden,
head of the English Department.

They are author-critic John W.
Aldridge, play director Norris Hough-
ton and American poet Frank O’Hara.

John W. Aldridge will speak on
Thursday, Mar. 16 at 8:15 p.m. in the
duPont Auditorium. His topic will be
“The European Education of Ernest
Hemingway.” On Tuesday, April 25,
Norris Houghton will speak on
“Trends in Contemporary American
Theater” in the duPont Auditorium
at 8:15 p.m.

Frank O’Hara, a young American
poet, will be the third speaker, read-
ing from his own poetry. The date of
his address will be announced later.

Challenging Critic

Aldridge has been described as a
young American critic who has dedi-
cated himself to what he calls “the
ideal of creative independence and
free critical dissent which has come
down to us in the central tradition of
American thought and letters.” He is
a critic of the academic critics and of
the influential literary quarterlies, and
he has challenged many of the stereo-
types of literary and social thought.

He has become alarmed at what
he calls an increasing domination
by the universities over the younger
creative writers, and he especially
deplores the smothering pressures of
the age of conformity. “It is the risk
we are forever running as mass men
in a mass culture; it is the risk we
can afford to run as human beings.”

Born in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1922,
Aldridge won a scholarship to the
University of Chattanooga in 1940. He
spent the summer of 1942 at the Mid-
dlebury College’s School of English at
Bread Loaf in Vermont, and then was
called into the Army. In 1946 he en-
tered the University of California at
Berkeley and became editor of the
magazine Occident. In November of
1947 his essay, “The New Generation
of Writers,” appeared in Harpers Mag-
azine. After receiving his B.A. degree
from the University of California in
1947, he accepted a teaching posi-
tion with the University of Vermont.
Between 1948 and 1955 he was assist-
ant director of the School of Modern
Critical Studies at Vermont.

The Lost Generation

His first book, The Lost Generation,
appeared in 1951. This book is a study
of “the writers of two wars,” and is
considered to be the first serious crit-
ical treatment of a number of the new
writers who emerged in the late 1940’s
such as Mailer, Capote, and Vidot. In |
1952 he compiled an anthology, Cri- '
tiques and Essays on Modern Fiction |
1920-1951, and he co-founded the lit- '

 

erary periodical, Discovery Magazine.
Another book, In Search of Heresy:
American Literature in the Age of
Conformity, is considered to be an
important work because it brings to
the attention of the general public
normally isolated literary controver-
sies. For several years he was book
critic of The Nation.

Currently, Aldridge is working on
a Modern Library edition of the Jeeves
stories of P: G. Wodehouse, on an
essay on Charlotte Bronte, and on a
book on American fiction. He is pres-
ently teaching at Hollins College.

Norris Houghton

Norris Houghton is an author, teach-
er, and play director. Houghton was
born in 1909, and received his A.B.
degree from Princeton in 1931. Be-
tween 1933 and 1939 he was the stage
designer of such Broadway produc-
tions as Good Hunting, Whiteoaks,
The Sleeping Prince and others. In
1951 and 1952 he was a production di-
rector of CBS television, and for 1959
and 1960 he was professor of Drama
and Guest Director of the Experiment-
al Theater at Vassar. He is a 1960-61
Guggenheim Fellow. Mr. Houghton
has been director of the American Na-
tional Theater and Academy, associate
editor of Theater Arts Magazine, and
the editor of Great Russian Short
Stories, published in 1958.

By GEORGE HONTS
Managing Editor

An audience of 1,300 cheered as
Sen. Barry Goldwater quipped the
“New Frontiers” to temporary ob-
livion and then went on to call for
less federal government Wednesday
evening in Doremus Gymnasium.

In a speech that ranks among the
best received addresses in recent
years here, the Arizona Republican
said there was no need for federal
aid to education and that the state
and local government units could
handle the building of needed class-
rooms. He placed the number of
needed school rooms at a level which
the states are building per year now.

The Senator warned of the dan-
ger of placing too much power in
the hands of the central govern-

Philosopher-Historian Toynbee |
To Present Lecture Here March 10 |

The white-haired, bushy-browed |
man who was such a familiar figure
about the Washington and Lee Univer-
sity campus three years ago returns
this week for a visit with an old
friend and a public lecture in Dore- |
mus Gymnasium.

Professor Arnold J. Toynbee, the
noted British philosopher-historian,
will pose the question, “Does History
Make Sense?” in his 8 p.m. address on |
Friday.

Toynbee, whose monumental A |
Study of History devotes eleven vol-
umes to civilizations of the past, was
a visiting scholar in residence at
Wahington and Lee during the spring
semester of 1958. He delivered a series
of 15 lectures on “A changing World |
in the Light of History” during his
first prolonged visit to an American
university campus.

During his Lexington sojourn, Pro-
fessor Toynbee worked on revisions
of A Study of History, resulting in a
12th volume entitled “Reconsidera-
tions” which will be published in
April.

While at Washington and Lee this
visit, Professor Toynbee will be the
guest of his long-time friend, Dr. Ed-
ward D. Myers, profesor of philoso-

phy at the university. Dr. Myers was |
a collaborator with Toynbee on the.
eleventh volume of A Study of His- |
tory, a gazateer companion volume to |
the first ten books.

On Friday and Saturday mornings, |

| the British scholar will meet with ad-

vanced Washington and Lee students
in philosophy and history. When he
was at the university in 1958, a class
of 15 students received academic cred-
it for work completed in connection |
with Toynbee’s lecture series. |

Toynbee, at 71, has become a}
“Twentieth Century immortal.” Many
of his opinions are challenged by oth-
er scholars. Some of his beliefs and |
public statements spark controversy.

In early February he was accused |
of being anti-semitic and challenged |
to public debate by the Israeli Am- |

| bassador to Canada, Jacob Herzog. |

Toynbee had said the Israeli treatment |
of Arabs in 1948 was morally com-|
parable to the Nazi persecution of
Jews during World War II. |

At Montreal’s McGill University,
Toynbee answered Ambassador Her- |
zogs protests by saying, “It is im- |

 

ment, saying it was against such a
concentration that the drafters of
the Constitution sought protection.

Sen. Goldwater was appearing for
the annual initiation ceremony of the
Beta Omega Chapter of Pi Sigma Al-
pha, the national political science fra-
ternity. Foul weather, which he
termed “California weather,” delayed
the Serator’s departure from Wash-
ington and he was too late in ar-
riving to take part in the initiation
ceremony or banquet. He did accept
honorary membership in Pi Sigma
Alpha, however.

New Members

Fifteen new members were taken in
the fraternity. Heading the list were
Dr. Leon F. Sensabaugh, professor of
history and Dr. Charles F. Phillips,
assistant professor of Economics.
Others who were initiated Wednes-
day night include; intermediate law
student John Petzold of Greenwich,
Conn.; Harold Fischel, PEP senior
from Washington, N.Y.; Albert Flo-
cher, PiKA senior from Baltimore,
Md.; Arnold Masinter, PEP junior
from Baltimore, Md.; Robert Osborne,
junior from Peekskill, N. Y.; George
Honts, Delt junior from Eagle Rock,
Va.; Robert Holley, DU senior from
Moorestown, N. J.; William Willes,
Sigma Nu Senior from Ft. Pierce,
Fla.; James Hitch, intermediate law
student from Ft. Worth, Tex; Carl
Connell, Sigma Nu junior from Beth-
el Park, Pa.; Stanley Cook, Lambda
Chi senior from Wheat Ridge, Colo.;
Robert O’Brien, senior from Newport
News, Va. and Clinton Anderson,
SPE senior from Lexington, Va.

Would Remain in Senate

At a news conference preceding
his talk in the gymnasium, the Sen-
ator declared he was not planning
on running for the presidency in
1964, but, he continued, that it is a long
way off and no one can be certain
of the future. He stated he would
rather remain in the Senate than
run for the presidency. His Senate
term expires in 1964.

When asked at the conference and
at the assembly if he would support
New York’s Gov. Nelson Rockfeller,
were he nominated in 1964, the Con-
servative replied “We'd have to have
some heart-to-heart talks.” The chief
area of difference between the Ari-
zona Conservative and the New York
Liberal lies, the former said, in their
ideas on the “welfare state.”

Concerned About 1962

As chairman of the Senate Repub-
lican campaign committee, Goldwater
said he was more concerned about
winning more seats in the House and
Senate in 1962 than in thinking about
the 1964 elections.

At the news conference, the Sen-
ator volunteered the comment that
he felt Nixon had made a mistake
last fall in gambling New York
state against the South. He indi-
cated he felt Nixon would have

 

been better off to not express an
opinion on civil rights in the hope
of winning the Empire State while
risking and losing his chance to
carry the South.

Big Gains in South

The Senator went on to say Re-
publicans have made their biggest
gains in the past 15 years in the
South, and the time would come
when the party could challenge the
entrenched Democrats there. He also
declared the Republicans should not
try to replace “Good Conservative
Democrats” like Senator Byrd and
Robertson of Virginia with Liberal
Republicans.

When asked about GOP strength
in the large cities, Goldwater replied
the party lacks the machinery pos-
sessed by the Democrats in most, if
not all, metropolitan areas. He esti-
mated the Democrats were ahead
150,000 in every large city, due to
patronage, before the elections begin.

A man with some unusual views on
foreign affairs, including withdraw-
ing recognition of Soviet Russia, he
said we could have peace easily by
bowing to Krushchev’s wishes. But
we must demand victory in the cold
war if we are to survive as the ma-
jor power. The Senator said if we
were to demand victory and strength-
en the “national backbone” we could
win many of the neutralist countries
who are wondering who is going to
win the East-West struggle to our
side.

On the last item covered in the
news conference, Goldwater said the
administration’s relief program will
not pull us out a recession—if we
are in a recession.

Proposals on Labor

As chairman of the Senate com-
mittee on Labor, Sen. Goldwater
presented several ideas on lessening
the “labor monopoly.” Among the
points in his program, which he
has introduced in six bills, were
measures to equalize the power of
labor and management. Among these
proposals were: 1) do away with ma-
jority representation in choosing a
local union; 2) make quicker court
action—via injunctions—in strikes
possible; 3) take unions out of poli-
tics in the manner business has been
restrained and 4) end compulsory
unionism.

His speech and his answers drew
three standing ovations and many
outbursts of applause from the crowd
of students, visiting dignitaries and
out-of-town guests in the gym.

The Senator flew to Charlottesville
from Washington. He was met by I.
Lee Potter, a prominent Virginia Re-
publican, and W&L senior Stan
Cook. Cook introduced Sen. Gold-
water.

On hand at the press conference
were the two Roanoke television sta-
tion units, reporters from most of
the area newspapers and the student
news reporters.

Senator Barry Goldwater

Senator Barry Goldwater treated Lexington to an unpre-
tentious and unprecedented expounding of political philosophy
Wednesday evening. His manner was impressive, and the re-
ception afforded him was indicative of the respect he enjoys in
this community.

The hackneyed term, “Conservatism,” however, does not,
in our opinion, do justice to Goldwater’s philosophy. Rather
than preserving what is established, the senator is advocating a
thorough renovation of the American system of government.
Also, there is no precedent in the past for the United States
to take the offensive and provoke warfare, yet this is what the
senator proposes we do. He holds that the only way to achieve
the necessary victory over communism is to aggress or take the
initiative against the communist world. Such credos cannot be
confined in a “Conservative” definition.

Because we agree with the greatest conservative, Edmund
Burke, that conservatism is the wholesome acceptance of mod-
erate change in so far as historical and social conventions and
convictions allow, we would term Sen. Goldwater as anything
but a conservative—he is very much a radical and construction-
alist. Also, for the sake of definition, the absence of govern-
mental control is not conservatism, but laissez faire.

If we had to pigeon-hole this divergent philosophy of the
Senator’s into a pat definiton, we would propose that it is pri-
marily Constitutionalistic. The Constitution, for Goldwater, is
an instrument for limiting the functions of government—"“a sys-
tem of restraints against the natural tendency of government to
expand in the direction of absolutism.” An obvious and neces-
sary deduction from his remarks here is that Federal control
must be curtailed and weakened.

His belief that Federal intervention in education is un-
constitutional is based upon the Tenth Amendment of the
Constitution which reads: “The powers not delegated to the
United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the

 

states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.”

Moreover, because Federal aid to the states does not go
without stipulations this Federal control is preeminent, Gold-
water argued. He cited the National Defense Education Act as
an example of this doorway to encroachment in which “Federal
aid under the act is conditioned upon compliance by the states
and local educational institutions with various standards and
specifications laid down by the department of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare.”

In an effort to expell Federal Control in those areas not
delegated by the Constitution, such as agriculture and education,
Goldwater proposes that the state and local governments should
take upon themselves this responsibility and effect change when
and if they desire. Such a premise, for Goldwater, leads to lower
Federal taxation and more individual representation.

As he stressed, ‘‘We the people . . .”, is the summation of
the Constitution, and it was in this phrase that the American
system of government had its origin.

However, we propose that the senator neglected certain
portions of the Constitution which might better elucidate his
proposals. First, not only does the preamble begin ‘We the peo-
ple...” but it also continues: ‘in order to form a more perfect
union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for
the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity . . .”

The implications of ‘‘to form a more perfect union” are ob-
vious. A Federal system was established vesting sovereignty, not
in the state, nor in the individual, but in a national government
which was and is “to promote the general welfare.”’

Secondly, the Second Amendment to the Constitution
reads as follows: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to
the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and
bear arms shall not be infringed.” Therefore, we may assume

If we accept Senator Goldwater’s premise that the power of the
Federal government must be limited to assure sovereignty to the
state and the individual, then we might justly hold the establish-
ment of military forces by each state contingent upon their will
and allocated taxation in lieu of a Federal oriented armed forces.

We would further assume that these militias, perhaps even
another Army of Northern Virginia, would wage a successful
war of aggression and attrition on the totalitarian communist
world. To quote the Senator: ‘Do it yourself, and keep the
Federal Government out of it.”” Hence, not only would domestic
spending by the Federal government be reduced in areas of
education, medical care and agriculture, but also national de-
fense spending, by far the greatest draw on the tax dollar, will
be reduced.

Need we refer to the ridiculous ‘‘buckboard” approach of
the Senator? Would that we could provide for ourselves and
ward off Indian arrows. The truth is, however, that exploding
population, unemployment, recession in business, and the threat
of nuclear destruction—the old platitudes—make the responsi-
bility too mammoth for a state or local organization.

Even if American mothers “stopped taking coffee breaks”’
and ‘‘taught the social graces to their children,” we fear that the
problem of educational need—more classrooms, greater teach-
er’s salaries, etc., would still not be solved.

We would, on the other hand, compliment the Senator for
proposing change—for this is the liberal spirit of which we
spoke last week. Even without his philosophy being girded down
in the Republican Party token, ‘Conservatism,’ he would be
just as much a confirmed reformer as the so-called liberals of our
day. Without such vitality in government our system would be-
come fatally stagnant.

In his book, Conscience of a Conservative, the labor union

 

problem is admirably assessed, and Sen. Goldwater’s solution

that every state has the constitutional right to maintain an army. | deserves recognition and possibly adoption.

 

 

By ROBERT C. KETCHAM

Friday Columnist

Wednesday evening an enthusias-
tie crowd congregated to hear busi-
nessman-politician Goldwater pre-
sent his own viewpoint. The Sena-
tor presented a simplified view of
his conservative position in an easy
to follow and relatively short talk.

Doubtless a good conservative
could read into the speech what he
wished and cite it as reflecting his
beliefs. With Goldwater’s emphasis on
the buckboard one could visualize
himself on the seat (if there were
room), just as the educational prob-
lem hit home when he stated that
“money is involved.” Nevertheless,
the Senator disregarded some contra
beliefs in his proposal for education
and his international solution which
should be presented.

The only facts Goldwater utilized
in regards to the Educational difficul-
ties were those on the number of
classrooms, 68,000, which he said the
government says we need. His figures
do not correspond with either the
Committee for economic Develop-
ment or the U.S. Office of Educa-
tion. The Office of Education reports
that last fall public schools were
short 142,160 classrooms. It further
states that 1,868,000 of the 37.6 mil-

lion pupils in public elementary
and secondary schools are in “ex-'
cess of normal capacity” and 685,000 |
are on half-day shifts. The Senator
only scoffed at the need for class-
rooms, saying that local authorities
are building at a greater rate than
needed.

Goldwater did advocate better
education but laid full burden on
the local level with state help to |
provide “a better equipped student.”
The remedy he mentioned was that
money should be spent “at the level
where it exists.”

Here then is the crux of the prob-
lem. Where does it exist?

The hard fact is that the number

 

resources which would supplement! in our educational system. The Land

the local taxes. The rural dominated
legislatures will not support raising
taxes and in addition there is the fear
of scaring away industry if taxes are
increased.

Education begins at home or as
Goldwater put it, “we parents are so
doggone busy we have neglected our
children.” But where does it end?
Beardsley Rum insists that it is un-
realistic to expect to achieve a ma-
jor breakthrough by operating one
at a time upon the forty-five thou-
sand school districts or even upon
the fifty legislatures.

Ruml’s analysis is a realization of
hard fiscal fact that the states and

Ordinance Act of 1785 did not tamp-
er with that principle and it is not

advocated in the proposed education |

bill. The Kennedy program is careful
to reserve to the states the right to
control education.

The Kennedy program leaves the
state the option to use the money
for building construction, teacher’s
salaries or for both. It is realistic
in reserving to the states the control
of education. The program is also
valid when it impliedly asserts that
America is not too poor to educate
its children but that the present re-
liance on fifty state legislatures and
local districts is not enough.

the opinion that Americans tend to be
seriously underexercised—an opin-

nedy’s recent reference to statistics
of Yale’s admissions office which
show declining degrees of physical
fitness in its freshman classes.
Certainly, if the two countries’

be judged by proportional numbers
of participants, the above opinion
seems to be justified. For if Amer-
icans have dedicated themselves to
mass education, the British have con-
sistently pursued the idea of sports
for the masses.

It is this idea that sports are for
those of all levels of competence,
not merely for the select few, that
is the distinguishing characteristic
of the British system, From it the
non-professional nature of the
sports—all of which are coached
and administered by students—
logically follows.

A great number and diversity of
sports are actively pursued at Ox-
ford. For the part-timers, there are

the Crown to Parliament, and the
rules of cricket.)

The thing that surprises an Amer-
ican about all these sports is the
total lack of supervision by non-
student personnel. For each sport,

 

there are usually one or two teams'|

each of these teams has a student |
captain who is responsible for re-
cruitment, schedueling, coaching,
managing and—if he has time left—
playing himself.

More amazing still is the nochalant
attitude with which the captains
approach this responsibility, and the
aplomb with which they plan such
ventures as trips through the coun-
tries of Europe or to matches in other
parts of Britain.

The only purpose for which full-
time help is usually employed is
that of maintenance of facilities.
And this is minimized by the fact
that facilities are generally poorer
and less extensive than in the U.S.
It is the modesty of these requests

I-M Basketball Finals Tonight

PikKA Wins Intramural Handball
Championship; SAE Is Second

The Intramural handball championship has finally been de-
cided after the final rounds of elimination were forced into a

second elimination.

This year’s handball champions are the PiKA’s, who man-
aged to edge out the SAE’s, Phi Psis, and the Sigma Nus for

the honor.

In the first round of the finals held®

last week, the Sigma Nus were elim-
inated while the remaining teams all
held 2-1 records. In this initial round,
the Phi Psis defeated the PiKA’s
3-2; the SAE’s in turn were victor-
ious over the Phi Phis 3-2; and in
the supposed “final” match of the
playoffs, the PiKa’s defeated the

SAE’s, thus causing a three way tie |

for first place.

In the opening round of the sec-
ond “finals,” the SAE’s again de-
feated the Phi Psis by a 3-2 mar-
gin. Bill Smith, Worth Brown, and
the doubles team of Brent Arthur
and Ned Olds accounted for the
SAE’s points, while Clark Valen-
tiner and Ace Hubbard were vic-
torious for the Phi Psis.

In the second and final round of
the championship playoff, the PiKA’s
defeated the SAE’s once again, and
took possession of the coveted crown,
which has been held for the past
few years by the Phi Phis.

Quick victories by Cy and Al
Painter put the PiKA’s ahead 2-0
early in the match. Their triumphs
came over Huntley Biggs and Brent
Arthur, respectively.

The SAE’s countered with victories
in the first and third matches as
Bill Smith defeated Nick Smith,
while Courtney Mauzy defeated

 

Mike Keating.

The doubles victory for the
PiKA’s broke the 2-2 deadlock, as
Tim Ireland and Bill Outman de-
feated the SAE’s Worth Brown and
Ned Olds.

Thus far in the Intramural season,
seven contests have been decided,
while the eighth contest, basketball,
is up for grabs this evening as the
Betas and Sigma Nus battle it out for
the crown.

Both of these teams tied with iden-
tical 2-1 records during the first
round of the finals held last week.
In their previous encounter, the
Betas pulled out a close victory
over their opponents for this eve-
ning.

The SAEs and Phi Delts will
meet in a consolation round to de-
cide the third and fourth place
victors. Both teams have 1-2 rec-
ords in final competition.

Wrestling Team Finishes Season
With ‘Very Successful’ 7-3 Record

By PETER ALFORD
Sports Writer

A 28-0 victory over hapless
U. Va. capped what Coach Dick Mil-
ler termed “a very sucecssful sea-
on with great promise for next year.”
This win over Virginia was our first
shutout over the Wahoos and gives
W&L an 18-6 series edge.

Posting a season’s slate of 7-3, the
Generals made the over-all record of
wrestling at Washington and Lee 179
wins, 91 losses, and 6 ties since 1931,
when the sport first appeared.

With all of this year’s squad
returning, newly elected co-cap-
tains Sandy Mersereau and Dave

 

Montgomery along with Coach
Miller anticipate another strong
team next season.

The grapplers’ three losses came

at the hands of West Virginia, Frank- |

lin and Marshall, and North Caro-
lina, two of which are subsidized.
Schedule changes for next year will
see New York University dropped
from the varsity slate, and North
Carolina State, Duke, Virginia and
North Carolina matches added for
the Freshman team.

The best performers on this year’s
team were Dave Montgomery with
an eight and two record, Herb Smith
with a seven and one record, and

Hoke Robinson, at 123 pounds,

Jud Babcock. Freshman Ed Jansen
lost only one out of five bouts, and
Bob Pagano won all three of his
Varsity encounters.

Outpointing their opponents 198

the 147 to 157 and 167-pound class-
es. Sandy Mersereau, Herb Smith.,
Dick Albert, and Ed Jansen compiled
a twenty-three, six, and one record
for the three weight divisions.

Lack of experience if not lack of
numbers was felt in the heavy-
weight division. Out of the five
heavyweights, only Bob Pagano
was able to win during the seasons.

The 137 pound class was disputed
over by three freshman and a senior.
Ted Hardin, Alex Alexander, Chick
Owens, and latecomer Ken Greer
shared the grappling duties compil-
ing an overall five, four, and one
slate.

With all of these wrestlers plus
junior varsity hopefuls Mike Brum-

season’s wrestlers, with only one
senior and the remainder juniors
and sophomores, should be ready to

honors this week.

|

Fauber, a 6-2 sophomore, was named to the second team |
while Thackston received an honorable mention. The team was |
selected by the Associated Pre'ss.

 

Thackston edged Fauber
W&L’s scoring honors by one point,
257 to 256. Thackston had an aver-
age of 14.26 points per game against
Fauber’s 14.22 points per game.

But Fauber received his second
team berth over Thackston because

18.8 rebounding average. In 18 games
the “Bipper” pulled down 302 re-
bounds in spite of his height handi-
cup. Playing against boys 6-5 to 6-8
didn’t bother Fauber. In fact, he had
his best nights against the taller
clubs.

Fauber went over the 20-mark in
rebounding four times. He collected
24 against Virginia, 24 against Emory
and Henry, 23 against Bridgewater,
and 20 against Sewanee.

Five times Fauber passed the
20-mark in scoring. He had 20-
point plus performances against
Virginia (26), Randolph-Macon
(23), Chattanooga (22), Roanoke
(21), and Sewanee (21). Thackston
turned in three 20-point games—
Virginia (27), Franklin and Mar-
shall (21), and Sewanee (20).

Virginia basketball history. Anthony |

scored 2,181 points in his four-year |
collge career.

Dom Flora, W&L’s All-American,
set the state scoring record with
2,310 points. Virginia’s Buzzy Wil-

On Campus 1:

(Author of “I Was a Teen-age Dwarf”, “The Many
Loves of Dobie Gillis’’, ete.)

WORDS: THEIR CAUSE AND CURE

Today let us take up the subject of etymology (or entomology,
as it is sometimes called) which is the study of word origins
(or insects, as they are sometimes called).

Where are word origins (insects) to be found? Well sir, some-
times words are proper names that have passed into the language.
Take, for instance, the words used in electricity: ampere was
named after its discoverer, the Frenchman Andre Marie Ampere
(1775-1836); similarly ohm was named after the German G. 8.
Ohm (1781-1854), watt after the Scot James Watt (1736-1819),
and bulb after the American Fred C. Bulb (1843-1912).

There is, incidentally, quite a poignant little story about Mr.
Bulb. Until Bulb’s invention, all illumination was provided by
gas, which was named after its inventor Milton T. Gas who,
strange to tell, had been Bulb’s roommate at Cal Tech! In fact,
strange to tell, the third man sharing the room with Bulb and
Gas was also one whose name burns bright in the annals of
illumination— Walter Candle!

The three roommates were inseparable companions in col-
lege. After graduation all three did research in the problem of
artificial light, which at this time did not exist. All America
used to go to bed with the chickens. In fact, many Americans
were chickens.

Well sir, the three comrades—Bulb, Gas, and Candle—
promised to be friends forever when they left school, but success,
alas, spoiled all that. First Candle invented the candle, got
rich, and forgot his old friends. Then Gas invented gas, got rich,
bankrupted Candle, and forgot his old friends. Then Bulb in-
vented the bulb, got rich, bankrupted Gas, and forgot his
old friends.

    

 

rcs,

ca =

<n ee
‘They hechne fs ,

Crass ower Mie

Candle and Gas, bitter and impoverished at the age respec-
tively of 75 and 71, went to sea as respectively the world’s
oldest and second oldest cabin boy. Bulb, rich and grand, also
went to sea, but he went in style—as a first-class passenger on
luxury liners.

Well sir, strange to tell, all three were aboard the ill-fated
Lusitania when she was sunk in the North Atlantic. And,
strange to tell, when they were swimming for their lives after the
shipwreck, all three clambered aboard the same dinghy!

Well sir, chastened and made wiser by their brush with death,
they fell into each other’s arms and wept and exchanged for-
giveness and became fast friends all over again.

For three years they drifted in the dinghy, shaking hands and
singing the Cal Tech rouser all the while. Then, at long last,
they spied a passing liner and were taken aboard.

They remained fast friends for the rest of their days, which,
T regret to report, were not many, because the liner which picked
them up was the Titanic.

What a pity that Marlboros were not invented during the
lifetimes of Bulb, Gas, and Candle! Had there been Marlboros,
these three friends never would have grown apart because they

would have known how much, despite their differences, they still
had in common. I mean to say that Marlboros ean be lit by
candle, by gas, or by electricity, and no matter how you light
them, you always get a full-flavored smoke, a filter cigarette
with an unfiltered taste that makes anyone—including Bulb,
Gas, and Candle—settle back and forget anger and strife and
smile the sweet smile of friendship on all who pass!

Another peaceful smoke from the makers of Marlboro is the

Another campaign — generating
much enthusiasm among both old
and current Oxford men has been
that for the Chair of Poetry. Four
candidates—Robert Graves, F. R.
Leavis, Enid Starkie, Helen Gard-
ner—had been nominated to suc-
ceed H. H. Auden in the coveted
post, which the occupant holds for
five years.

Graves received half of the 658
votes cast, out of a list of 30,000
M.A.’s eligible to vote. Headline in
the tabloids the next day shouted:
“Oxford Digs Graves.” Many were
amused by the following placard
displayed in support of Graves:
“AUDENtem superare nequit mulier-
cula matem, Nec LEVIS iste modes
aequiperare GRAVES.”...

demonstration by Bertrand Rus-

against the establishment of Po-
laris bases in Holy Loch, Scotland.

armarment, or OND, which calls
for unilateral renunciation of nu-
clear weapons and of NATO by
Britain, is increasingly vocal in
Oxford debates and discussions. ...

 

Craven Views Goldwater

front of a thousand people it seemed
that the questions were very good
reflections of the level on which
the crowd listened to the Senator. I
was especially impressed with the
question, “Senator, what are your
views on federal aid to the aged
for medical purposes?” Since I don’t
follow politics too closely I was eager
to hear Goldwater’s answer to this,
and you could tell that he was anx-
ious for someone to ask him the
question. And I thought that it was
remarkable the way his answer fit in
with his views on federal aid to edu-
cation.

Now I seem to be back discussing
politics again, and I’m quite lost. I
suppose that I could comment on
Goldwater’s jokes, but no doubt they
will be dealt with elsewhere on this
page. So I will stop and refer you to
my colleagues. Be a liberal and read
them well, they will further your
understanding of the issues at stake
in these trying times.

Another great controversy was
created when a student magazine re-
cently began reviewing lectures by
University Professors. The quality
of lectures is notoriously low by
American standards, but this is
because they are not such a vital
part of the Oxford system of teach-
ing.

The Proctor (yes, here too!) re-
acted by banning any further re-
views, and there resulted a great
clamor of protests from dons and
undergraduates alike. One of the
professors whose lectures got un-
favorable reviews circulated a let-
ter, which was signed by about 100
dons, protesting against the Proctor’s
action. As of now, however, the
order has not been rescinded....
Meanwhile, American influence
continues to creep in. A motion by
an American at Wadham to have the
student body of the college formu-
late a written constitution has been
tabled in the same good spirit in
which it was proposed.

At the same time, the latest ugly
American  incident—at least as
viewed by most Americans here—
was an article in a student magazine
by a Harvard graduate pointing out
the faults of Oxford, the merits of
Harvard, and how Oxford could be-
come like Harvard—as it unques-
tionably should!—by following his
suggestions. Long live the Ivy
League!

 

Ideas Need Revision
(Continued from page 2)

quipped in backing up his proposal,
but it would “show the wobbly na-
tions we are the ones they better
ride with.”

It was at least interesting to see
the man pass over the neutral na-
tions, the subsequent value of the
U.N. and the relations with our al-
lies if such a move were taken as
to Russia.

The Senator dealt with medical
care in the same manner. He dis-
missed the question by stating that
there is “no demonstrable need”; a
reemphasis of the old hat that starv-
ing is a local problem.

There is no doubt that Goldwater
is a pleasant well dressed man with
an easy manner of speaking. It was
sad and rather appalling, however,
to think that because this man pro-
fesses a belief in property rights and
individualism the listeners should

fically the movements are opposed
to the recent amendment to the law.
This amendment, passed to prevent
lunch counter integration, has hiked
penalties for trespassing to a max-
imum of a $1,000 fine and one year
in jail.

The methods used by sit-ins in
opposing this law can be divided into
categories. First, there are those
movements which seek to get the law
declared unconstitutional by appeal-
ing court decision to higher courts.
This method is both slower and more
legal than the more frequently used
second method.

The latter method seeks to
change, not the law itself, but the
attitude of the community about
the law. Groups using this meth-
od may be separated into two di-
visions, those who are unwilling to
accept responsibility for their ac-
tions and those who are willing to
do so. The first group does little
good. They break the law and are
arrested, but they avoid punish-
ment by pressuring to prevent
themselves from being tried, by
asking the court for mercy, or by
having the NAACP pay their fines.

Of far greater importance are those
who are willing to go to jail in pro-
test against the law. By suffering for
what they feel is right these partici-
pants hope to bring about a catharsis

 

Arnold Toynbee Returns
To Deliver Address

kill more thon one man to be a mur-
derer.”

During his previous visit to Lex-
ington, Professor Toynbee viewed the
race into space as “a form of escap-
ism.” “It seems premature to think
of outer space before we’ve learned
to keep the peace with each other on
this planet,” he explained.

A dominent theme of his lecture
series in Lee Chapel was the resurg-
ence to power in the world of what
Toynbee called “the ordinary people”
of the under-developed global areas.

 

He viewed Western pre-eminence in
world affairs as a temporary and rap-
idly changing situation.

Brownlee Tackles Problem Of Sit-In Demonstrations;
Confusion Results From Failure To Realize Goals, Aims

in the hearts of those around them
and to get other people active in op-
posing the law. This type of move-..
ment employs non-violence at its
ideal level. This is the type used in
both of the recent trials in Lynch-
burg.

So far I have tried to analyze the
sit-in movement much as a partici-
pant in the movement would analyze
it. There are, however, many ques-
tions which the participant should
ask himself. These include the fol-
lowing: Will not everyone’s follow-
ing his personal beliefs instead of
the law lead to anarchy? By not
waiting for the law to be properly
appealed, does not the second type
of movement oppose not only an un-
just state law but also a just federal-
law system? Do not the sit-ins have
more bad effects than good effects on
the minds of those unsure about in-
tegration? Are not economic boycotts
of other departments of stores with
segregated lunch counters a more ef-
fective and more legal way of ob-
taining the desired results?

Most sit-in participants have asked
themselves these questions, but many

have not. Wrestling with them should |

be a prerequisite for those who do
particiapte in the movements just as
an undertaking of the goals and
methods of the movements should be
a prerequisite for those who criticize
them.

Blood Drive Quota Set

(Continued from page 1)

ing difficulty until recently when the
Keydets donated 185 pints in an
excellent turn-out unsurpassed here.
Drive officials hope for a similar
showing from Washington and Lee.

Carlson said the Stonewall Jack-
son Hospital is given a 600 pint quota
for use. This amount is divided be-
tween W&L-Lexington and Buena
Vista. All other blood produced could
well go to make up for the blood
debt the Roanoke Bank has com-
piled from lack of adequate response
in this area.

The director commented that many
W&L students feel that they are
imposed upon—but he was impressed
with the contributions to the Charity
Chest and he again said W&L stu-
dents who need blood get it free
from the Bank. He scored one of the
weaknesses of the program as being
the rule requiring students under
21 to obtain parental permission to
donate. This rule, he says, delays
participation and stifles student in-
terest in the program.

Blood donating, Carlson continued,
is an unending task since the need
for blood never ends.
