SWMSEC Try-Outs End
Tonight; Need 20 Actors

The much talked about 1961 Student
War Memorial Scholarship Fund Com-
mittee Musical ended its second out
of three nights of try-outs last night
with a fine showing of talent. Over
twenty-five boys have been down to
the Troubadour Theatre from 7-10
p.m. for try-outs and about the same
number are expected tonight, the final
night. From here, the show will prob-
ably go to one of the girl’s schools to
cast the twenty odd female parts which
the show will require.

Steve Danzansky, author and the
director, had this to say about the
try-outs: “We are all very pleased
at the response shown by the student
body in the last two nights. It is in-
deed gratifying to see boys who want
to be in something, rather than hav-
ing to be pushed into it. I can’t stress
enough, however, the importance of
having everyone who has any talent
at all, try-out. We are doing a larger
show this year and thus have about
twice as many parts to be filled. So far,
we don’t have enough talented men to
fill them.”

Danzansky, who wrote and directed
last year’s show “the Cannon’s Mouth,”

Iwo Jima Phot

By R. ROY GOODWIN
Asst. Managing Editor

The long-standing controversy con-
cerning the authenticity of the United
States Marine Corps’ famous “Flag
Raising on Iwo Jima” picture, and of
the statute of the same scene now in
Washington, was brought up again last
night by Merle Miller, a noted author
and television writer.

Speaking to a capacity crowd in
duPont Auditorium last night, Mil-
ler, who was the third speaker of
the Washington and Lee Glasgow
Lecturers, said that the picture and
the statute are both “phonies.”

Miller became involved in the con-
troversy, he said, when he began to
work on a television play called “The
American” for Playhouse 90 some two
years ago.

The play was concerned with the life
of an American Indian Ira Hayes, who
was shown in the group supposed to
have taken part in the original flag
raising.

Not the Raising

Hayes, Miller said, was not in the
actual flag raising but instead was
standing near the spot when public
relations men from the Armed Forces
asked him to step forward with five
other Marines and pose for the picture.

Nearly 100 pictures were taken, The

last was taken by an Associated Press |

photographer named Joe Rosenthal.
This picture was the one that has now
become so famous for being the “au-
thentic” picture of the Iwo Jima flag
raising.

 

 

seemed pleased at the number of men
in that show who auditioned for a
second try this year: “I can’t help but
feel that the boys liked what we did
last year, and are willing to offer their
services again in 1961. Our thanks to

Joel E. Kocen To Succeed
White As Review Editor

Joel E. Kocen, Washington and Lee
University senior law student from
Richmond, today was named editor-
in-chief of the Washington and Lee
Law Review for the second semester
of the 1960-61 school year.

He succeeds Hugh V. White, Jr.,
Holland, Va., law senior, in the top
position. Kocen will direct a staff of
top Washington and Lee law students
in the preparation of volume 18 of the
Law Review, scheduled for publica-
tion next fall. Professor Ritz announc-

Alumnus Of Washington and Lee Has Distinguished
Himself In Government Posts; Tap Day In February

The Hon. H. Graham Morison, for-
mer Assistant Attorney-General of
the United States will be the principal
speaker on Omicron Delta Kappa tap
day scheduled for February.

Mr. Morrison is a 1930 graduate of
Washington and Lee, and was gradu-
ated from the W&L Law School in ’32.

A native of Johnson City, Tenn.,
Morison was associated with Wendell
Wilkie’s New York Law firm during
the late 1930’s. He went to Washington
in 1942 with the War Production
Board. Morison joined the Justice De-
partment as a special assistant to the
attorney-general for wartime contract
negotiations. Later as head of the
claims division of the department, he
successfully prosecuted the contempt
cases against John L. Lewis and
the United Mine Workers.

Morison also defended the govern-
ment in numerous loyalty review trials,
and in the multi-million dollar claims
arising from the Texan City, Tex.
waterfront disaster of 1947. He served
as counsel for the economic stabiliza-
tion agency before going into the anti-
trust division as assistant attorney-
general.

Morison is now residing in Washing-
ton, D.C., and is a partner with the
firm of Morison, Murphy, Clapp and
Abrams.

Morison is an officer in the Marine

the USMC and saw action in the Pa-

A devoted alumnus of Washington
and Lee, Morrison has served as trus-
tee of the alumni fund of the uni-
versity. While at W&L he was
a member of Phi Gamma Delta, ODK,
Phi Delta Phi, and Phi Beta Kappa.
Morison, a close friend of President
Harry Truman, was instrumental in
drawing the former president to
Washington and Lee last year to key-
note the mock convention.

The announcement of Morison’s visit
was made by Warren Goodwin, presi-
dent of Alpha Circle, Omicron Delta
Kappa. Other officers in the organi-
zation are: Henry Harrell, secretary-
treasurer, and Prof. Rupert N. Latture,
faculty advisor and charter member.

Change Made
In 2nd Semester
Registration

A modified procedure for second
semester registration was announced
today by Dr. William W. Pusey, III,
Dean of the College.

A list of courses for which he is
registered for the second semester
will be provided each student (except
in the School of Law). These lists must
be picked up by students at the Regis-
trar’s Office next week between Mon-
day, Dec. 12 and Friday, Dec. 16.

Students will then have the oppor-
tunity to consider their second se-
mester schedules carefully over the
Christmas holidays. All changes for
the second semester will have to be
made on Thursday and Friday, Jan.
5 and 6, in consultation with the stu-
dent’s adviser or major professor; in-
formation on how changes can be
made will be attached to each student’s
course list. It is emphasized that no
changes (except those directly result-
ing from first semester failure in-
curred after this time) can be made
on the opening day of the second
semester, as in the past.

Dr. Pusey stressed that those of-
ficials dealing with registration felt
that the course lists would be of great
assistance to students in verifying be-
fore the semester begins their second
semester programs and detecting er-
rors and modification that seemed
necessary. Advisers and major pro-
fessors will be available as in the past
on the stated days in January to assist
students in making desirable changes.

Fancy Dress Costume Sales
Exceed Those Of Last Year

Initial figures on the 1961 Fancy
Dress costume sales indicate that sales
were considerably higher than last
year. Three hundred seventy-four
were sold during the first period of
costume sales, which compares with the
308 that were sold during the same
time last year.

Mrs. Arlene Stover from Oak Hall
in Roanoke said that students seemed
to show much greater enthusiasm for
the dance than they have in the past
few years. Mrs. Stover will return to
W&L on January 10 and 11 to com-
plete the ordering and measuring for
costumes.

Mrs. Stover emphasized the fact that
the members of the figure must send
her the measurements for their dates
by Dec. 14. She must have the meas-
urements for bust, waist, hips, dress
size, weight, height, hat and length
from waist to ankle by this date.

She also remarked that other stu-
dents who have not sent in measure-
ments should do so as soon as possible.
Those students who sent the measure-
ments in earliest will receive the best
costumes. They should send them to:
Arlene Stover, Oak Hall, in Roanoke.

Those students who have ordered
their costumes and decide to cancel

of war bonds to war-weary Ameri-
cans.

When Hayes got to Washington he
was sent on a War Bond tour, when
he wasn’t even in the original picture!

Ira Hayes died a drunken death
five years later, Miller said. “So I
wrote a TV play about him.”

Raise Question

Miller’s point in raising the question
about the validity of both the statue
and the famous picture was to em-
phasize the interference that a writer
for mass media encounters when he
presents a play on television.

When plans for the play were form-
alized, he said, protests began pour-
ing in from many sources.

“Even the United States Bureau of
Indian Affairs protested,” he said,
“for there are no drunken Indians.”

In a satirical tone, Miller said that
the AP threatened to sue the Nation-
al Broadcasting Company (NBC) for
six million dollars if the play were
shown.

What could one do? he asked.

“In the final telecasting,” he said,
“we said that ‘maybe the picture was
a phony’.”

For Money

Why did I make that concession?
“For money.”

Miller then leveled criticism at the
American public for its tastes in tele-
vision that are reflected in the poor
quality of the network shows.

“When something good is put on
TV, nobody looks at it,” he added.

He cited several recent programs
including “The U-2 Incident” and

 

 

their orders may do so without charge
until January 6. This may be done by
notifying Steve Galef at Box 497,
Lexington, before the Jan. 6. cut-off
date. There will be a charge of $7.00
for all cancellations after this date.
The theme For the Fancy Dress Ball
is Shakespearean, and the costumes are
taken from the periods of six different
Shakespearean plays. The main se-
lection of costumes is from a group

Singing Groups Participate
In Inter-Frat Song Contest

Singing groups from each of Wash-
ington and Lee University’s 18 social
fraternities will compete in an Inter-
fraternity Song Festival tonight.

The competition is scheduled for

Prizes will be awarded for the first
and second places in the student con-
test.

Volunteer groups from each of the
fraternities will participate in the festi-
val, which is sponsored by the Wash-

cil. The competition is an annual event
on the campus.

: Real or Phony? Asks Miller

“Harvest of Shame” as examples of
excellent television programs that re-
ceived very low ratings in audience
viewing polls. “Where were the peo-
ple?” he asked.

Miller, in a reference to the Amer-
ican motion picture industry said that
U.S. movies have depicted the Nazi
of World War II as members of the
“misguided race.” We, as a race of
democratic people, have tended to “go
soft” on the Nazis as a result of the
movies, he added.

The reason for this, he pointed out,
is because the Germans pour more
money into American made films than
any other foreign country.

Again emphasizing the importance
of money, Miller said, “The one word
of the century—money.”

Miller was the last of the three
Glasgow lecturers apeparing at W&L
this year. Poet John Ciardi and Novel-
est William Humphrey were the other
two lecturers. Humphrey wrote the
popular novel Home From the Hill.

Dr. A. R. Borden, chairman of the
Glasgow Endowment Committee, in-
troduced Miller last night.

Wednesday night Miller spoke on
“Bach on a Musical Saw” in which
he dealt with the motion picture in-
dustry. He also criticized almost all
of the mass media in his lecture.

NOTICE
The Forensic Union will meet Mon-
day at 7:15 p.m. in the Student Union
to debate the question: “Resolved that
the Electoral College should be abol-

Che Ring-tum Phi
Our Honor System

There has been much said and written of
late concerning the current status of the Wash-
ington and Lee honor system. We hold it a
healthy sign that the ramifications of this sys-
tem are being examined and questioned by
the student body at large and the campus me-
dia. Contrary to the belief of a few, this honor
system belongs to the student body—and not
to the Executive Committee alone, or to the
administration, or to the centuries of precious
heritage. The students of Washington and Lee
instituted it, and they renew its vitality from
year to year. Only through the support of
succeeding generations of students can this
honor system be sustained.

If, however, student support of the honor
system or dedication to its purposes diminishes,
then the true and underlying strength of the
system itself is jeopardized. This is a far greater
cause for alarm than over or under loading.
It becomes incumbent upon the Executive
Committee in session to concern itself with
the sentiment of the 1200 men who comprise
the bulk of this academic community. Ob-
viously, this sentiment takes various forms.
The Executive Committee must discern the
majority will from the arguments and com-
ments heard.

The Student Body Handbook affords the
responsibility of interpretation and mainten-
ance of the honor system to “the public opin-
ion of the student generation involved.” If this
system was not flexible to the demands of an
evolving academic life, by virtue of its own
decadence it would be lost—amid contempor-
ary values, it would seem archaic, and would in-
duce lip service and utter disregard rather than
dedication.

We all know General Lee’s definition of
honor: ‘We have but one rule, our students
are gentlemen.” Even this short, concrete
statement implies that the rule is ours—his
“we” has no other connotation. Washington
and Lee’s honor system is its student body. It
is not an obscure, idealistically conceived char-
ter fled away to be used as a symbol of authori-
ty by an oligarchical Executive Committee;
nor is it an abstract quality to which we pay
homage; nor again, is it a set of legislated rules
defining those areas of student life which fall
subject to requirements of honor. It is rather
manifest in the opinions, the ideals, and the

logic of those students presently attending this
university.

The Executive Committee, therefore, is
only representative of this contemporary at-
titude. It is not, as a few might hold, composed
of qualified interpreters of honor, who con-
demn and condone for the betterment of the
less qualified student majority.

If it is ever the opinion of the student
generation attending this university, acting
in good faith, that the honor system itself is
not worthy of student support, then we respect
their right to abolish the code, although we
may, at present, differ with their appraisal.

We conclude, therefore, that the student
body has the inalienable right to question, to
dispute or to champion revision of any appli-
cation of our honor system. Furthermore,
this voice must be heard. In the event that a
situation such as that provoked by the trans-
ference of dance plans arises, although the
opposing stands may have individual merit,
we must adopt the view shared by the student
majority. When the decision is made, either
by a poll of the Executive Committee or refer-
endum (the latter, we contend, should be used
more often), it should reflect the will of the stu-
dent body. Such an endorsement would neces-
sarily guarantee support.

One of the virtues, then, of our honor
system is that it is flexible. Because of this
flexibility, the honor system should always exist
at the pleasure of the student body in attend-
ance. The honor system does not “support
various fields of student activity” (as the
Tuesday Edition suggests), nor does it, like
a crutch, support a student body with an ideal
of honor in the midst of dishonorable tenden-
cies. Rather, honor-conscious individuals of
this university support the honor system and
all of its manifestations. Theirs is the right,
nay the duty to establish a sound basis for
their devotion. To those who would legislate
honor for posterity and declare their inter-
pretation inspired and permanent, we reply
with the following remark from Colton:

“Honor is unstable, and seldom the same,
for she feeds upon opinion, and is as fickle
as her food. She builds a lofty structure on
the sandy foundation of the esteem of those
who are of all beings the most subject to

change.”
The Late Dr.

Editor’s Note: The following article

 

 

As the weeks go on and I continue
to write this column, I find myself
wondering what there will be to write
about next week. It
is a problem, but so
far some solution
has presented itself.
All I really have to
do is walk around
the campus for an
afternoon and I
pass column after
column. And walk-
ing toward the
dandy gym last
week I ran into a
few columns on the
inside of this maninificent structure.

I was going to the gym to get in
shape for my key job of refereeing in-
tramural basketball games (this jour-
nalism activity pays next to nothing),
but all the punching bags were check-
ed out, so I shot some basketball by my-
self, After about ten minutes of gruel-
ling exercise I decided that I was in
good shape, so I decended into the
bowels of the building for a shower.

I checked out a towel, took my
shower, got dressed and then was
confronted with an almost insurmount-
able problem—I tried to check my
towel back in.

A little golden haired man smoking
a corn cob asked me what I wanted,
and tried to give me a new clean, dry
towel.

“TI don’t want one,” I said politely,
“I want to check one in.”

“You can’t check towels out,” he
said with a scowl.

“I don’t want to check one out; I’m
through with this one.” I showed him
my wet limp, formless towell that was
beautifully embroidered with “Steves-
ville.”

This seemed too much for him, and
his corn-cob began to pop. Again, he
sputtered, “You can’t check towels
out.”

“But, sir, I want to check one in,”
I pleaded.

“What did you check it out for?”

Well, it’s a custom in my family, go-
ing back several generations, to dry

off after showers. That way you don’t
get as cold, and your clothes stay
drier. I had a hard time explaining
this, but finally got through. He took
my towel, and asked me what I'd
checked it out with.

“A check-out slip sir.”

So I explained what they were, got
mine back, promised to be a good boy,
to do my daily dozen (or is it DAILY
DOZEN?), and swore that I'd never
check out another towel. And now that
I’ve written this I’m haunted with fears
that I may be sentenced to P.E. 12 for
two years, or have my cuts cancelled,
or even worse that I'll be denied a
diploma if the authorities find out

PDP Elects New Officers

Phi Delta Phi Legal Fraternity has

elected officers for the spring semester. |

This is one of the three honorary fra-
ternities in the law school here. The
officers selected at the meeting held
Thursday at the Robert E. Hotel were
Michale Masinter, president; Macon
Putney, clerk; Dick Lang, treasurer;
and Leigh Ansell, historian.

The outgoing officers were: Robert
Gilliam, president; Bob Frank, clerk;
Bill Moore, treasurer; and Paul Bolt,
historian.

Navy, stated that it was given “for
Mr. Foster’s outstanding contributions
| to the Department of the Navy in the
fields of flight safety and aviation
training. Through his unfailing under-
standing of the problems ever present
in military flying, Mr. Foster consist-
ently provided timely and pointed-
ly humorous texts, bringing to the
readers most easily understood and re-
tained.”

After describing the great contri-
| bution Mr, Foster had made to Naval
Aviation, Admiral Pirie pinned the

Confusion Reigns In West Berlin
Over U.S. Monitary Problems

A friend who is studying in Ger-
many wrote recently about Secretary
Anderson’s visit to Bonn: “it is a

. very consistent pol-
' icy which says, on
the one hand, that
we will defend
Berlin to the last
man, and on the
other says that if,
the dollar is threat- |
ened, we will move
troops out of Ger-
many.” While usu- :
ally uninvolved in|
affairs of state, I!
can imagine my!
friend’s concern with this diplomatic
blunder as he attempts an explanation
to his colleagues.

There is a certain mystery in why
this balance of payments problem was
so long ignored and suddenly, even
hysterically come to grips with. There
must have been considerable conserva-
tive frustration to even propel forces
ready to face the problem.

Hero-Father Alarmed

The prudent hero-father who has
steadied us through eight years and
three recessions was alarmed. The
dollar was at stake and he, who
has been taught all his life to react,
came through with a diplomatic spasm.

We, the American people, have been
carried to the heights of personal di-
plomacy with pictures of handshakes,
statistics of mileage covered, headlines
of Camp David, or visits to Kishi. As
if this were not enough we are now
confronted with a Bursur who also
feels his administration-given right to
sweep aside diplomatic protocol.

This diplomatic unpreparedness
found the Chancellor, Finance Minis-
ter Erhard and their colleagues any-
thing but rehearsed for the Treasurer’s
obsession with support cost for the
army and his determination to discuss
nothing else.

Not Surprised

Mr. Erhard and the Chancellor were
not surprised to be asked to help the
U.S. government with its balance of
payments problem. The _ speculator’s
attack on the dollar and the gold price
is at the same time an attack to sterl-
ing, the French franc, and indirectly
to the mark. Erhard did offer pre-
payment of the 650 million dollar
German debt for American aid, which
is not due to be paid off for another
20 years or so; and other measures
which he estimated would improve the
balance of payments by another 500

George H, Foster Given
Navy’s Distinguished Service Award

Naval Aviation since World War IL.
Mr. Foster served the Navy in the Re-
serve in WW II during which he ad-
vanced to the rank of lieutenant com-
mander. In the early part of the war,
he served as an air combat intelli-
gence officer with a patrol squadron.
Later in 1944, he came to DCNO (Air)
and was a Sense Pamphlet writer from
then on.

Mr. Foster, at the time of his death
on 26 November 1959, was a profes-
sor at Washington and Lee University,
Lexington, Va., where he had been a
faculty member since WW II. He
earned his doctorate degree at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina.

In 1954, Naval Aviation News re- |
ported: “He has the proud record of
having produced more Sense Pam-
phlets than any other writer con-
nected with Training Lit.” And this
number was greatly augmented in the
years since that statement was made.

Mr. Foster’s work was marked by
brilliancy, wit, and thoroughness.
Though not a Naval Aviator, Mr.
Foster handled each subject so ac-
curately that no pilot found his work
anything but authentic. Many of the!
Sense Pamphlets at the end of WW II,
and all of the Aviation Training Sense
Pamphlets since 1946, as well as all
those revised and brought up to date,
were written or edited by Mr. Foster.

In a steady succession of Sense
Pamphlets, Mr. Foster revealed an in- |
creasing facility to deal with difficult
concepts in such a way that pilots
would get the word, heed the warning
and escape the fate of witless Dilberts. |

million. These were also ignored.

The Anderson proposal that the Ger-
mans immediately assume the $600
million support costs of the U.S. troops
in Germany was a ridiculous and radi-
cal gesture. Such proposals which go
to the very heart of the Western al-
liance can hardly build the Allied
confidence in which the U.S. adminis-
tration takes such pride.

Doubtless the prospering countries
do need to discuss and shoulder com-
mon NATO burdens but such a block-
buster is not called for. Furthermore,
the impression might be that our
contributions to NATO are nothing
more than a gift to Europe instead of
a concrete investment in our country’s
defense.

Something Is Wrong

The recent gold speculation on the
London market as well as the $10
billion lost in reserves in the past
three years raises a presumption that
something is wrong. The Economist
states that “America’s present pay-

ments deficit is so much the result| .

of special non-commercial payments
that its future course could not be
predicted by any economist, however
far sighted.”

One thing we do know, there is
no free market for our gold. The pres-
ent situation is quite artificial. The
Federal Reserve sells gold to central
banks and monetary authorities “for
legitimate monetary purposes” at $35
an ounce. In its simplest terms, dollars
are Officially convertible into gold
by one group, central banks and
monetary authorities, and not by any-
one else wishing to pay the pegged
price or more. However, there is no
possibility for American authorities
to prevent those two groups from
trading with each other.

The central banks do not sell or
speculate to any extent on the free
market in London; in fact these banks
abandoned the London gold market
during the recent rise and it was left
to speculators. It seems to me that
a necessary forward step would be
to actively encourage those central
banks to sell to anyone who wishes
to pay more than $35 an ounce rather
than leave the matter to the specu-
lators.

A more obvious discrepency involves
the private investment capital which
goes abroad. This money is placed on
the liability side of the balance of
payments, in layman terms, and makes
it seems as if we are losing when
money flows abroad.

Slater Brings
Oriental Touch
To South-W&L

By MALCOLM BROWNLEE
Friday Columnist

“Oh boy, liver and onions,” said the
boy as he sat down at one of the
front tables in the
Washington and

Lee dining hall.
“Well, I'll be a
son of a gun if it
isn’t,” his friend
said. “Best thing in

ae first. “I was just
Brownlee telling Joe a few

minutes ago that I
sure hoped we’d have liver and onions
tonight.”

“Sure folks like steak and all that
fancy stuff, but as for me, just give
me liver and onions any day.”

“You've said it.”

“You can get tired of steak after
a while, but I can’t imagine ever get-
ting tired of liver and onions.”

“Say you guys,” said the first to
the rest of the table, “does anybody
not want their liver and onions?”

No one at the table answered.
“Would you like for me to get you
some more?” asked the waiter. “Hey,
men, who wants more meat?”

It was a silly question, for, of course,
everybody wanted more liver and
onions. The waiter departed in quest
of the desired meat. “Say, guys,” said
the first boy, “we sure do have wonder-
ful waiters, don’t we?”

“The best in the world, and there’s
no doubt about it,” said the second.
“I just wish I was rich enough to tip
them.”

“Me, too; they sure deserve it. Would
you pass the potatoes?”

The second boy handed him a steam-
ing dish of mashed potatoes. “They’re
powdered,” he said.

“Great,” said the first; don’t you
think they’re much better powdered?”

“Not a hair’s doubt about it. Just

“Gee, this whole deal is a wonderful
set up, isn’t it?”

“Yeah. I wonder how in the world
Mr. Slater does it. Can you imagine
anybody else serving a meal like this
for this low price?”

“Yes, as far as good appetizing food
goes, it just can’t be beaten.”

“It seems almost as impossible as a
ship in a whiskey bottle, doesn’t it?”

“No,” said the first, “that’s a little
too strong. This is the type place you
find all over America. America, the
land in which the meaning of impos-
sible is not known,”

“America, the land of good food
and inexpensive restaurants.”

“This is the type of thing which
could happen only in America,” said
the first.

“It’s the type of thing which could
happen only in the South,” said the
second,

The two boys finished their meal
and left. They spoke with no trace of
a foreign accent. Only by looking at
them could you tell they were Chinese.

managed to better teammate Robin
Dunlap and two hapless Wahoos as
he grabbed first with a winning time
of 2:26.4.

The Generals captured the four
remaining events, and thus knocked
off Virginia for the second straight

year.

Coach Norris Eastman seems real
pleased with his team thus far, but
in his rather modest manner, all that
he will admit is:

“Sure we’ve won these first two
meets, but what I’m looking for are
those victories over West Virginia and
East Carolina, to say nothing of Mary-
land.”

Although these meets are some time
in the distant future, a more immedi-
ate consideration hinges around a meet
that the Generals have this Saturday
with Catholic University of Wash-
ington, D.C.

While nothing is known of their
relative strength, the Generals are
hoping to make this win number
three. The meet will begin at 3:15.

in right behind him in this event,
by midway in the meet, W&L com-
manded a 31-21 lead.

The Wahoos managed to pick up
the remainder of their points in the
200-yd. butterfly and the 400-yd. free-
style, but this was only a ripple com-
pared to the force that W&L sent
against them.

captured the two first places in this
event. This put W&L out in front,
and the Wahoos never came closer
than ten points the rest of the meet.

Coach Norris Eastman and his var-
sity swimming team added to the woes
of our neighbors to the North last
Tuesday, as they scored a decisive
victory over the University of Vir-
ginia, 59-36.

“| ENGINEERED MICROWAVE TOWER LOCATIONS

When Bill Pigott knocked on the door of
Pacific Telephone, he had two big assets. One
was an electrical engineering degree from Seattle
University. The other was a craving to jump
right into vital engineering problems.

It was not long before Bill was exploring
Washington’s rugged Cascade Range in a heli-
copter to find sites for microwave relay towers

struction job. Today, it’s considerable satisfac-
tion to him to see these towers spanning the
mountains, knowing that his planning helped
put them there.

This airplane is actually a flying
classroom. The course taught in it
is Air Navigation, under real con-
ditions. The students are young
men who have been selected as pos-
sible future leaders of the Aero-
space Team. Graduation after 32
weeks of training will win each of
the students the honored silver
wings of an Air Force Navigator
and an Officer’s Commission.

For certain young men, this
training can open the way to a
bright career of executive poten-
tial. Right now the Air Force is
scoring impressive technological
advances in the fields of naviga-
tion, guidance and tracking, elec-
tronics and radar. And here is
where its highly trained and expe-
rienced Navigators will be expected
to take over command positions of
increasing responsibility.

To qualify for Navigator train-
ing as an Aviation Cadet, you must
be between 19 and 26%—single,
healthy and intelligent. And you
must want to build an exciting,
interesting career in the Aerospace
Age. If you think you measure up,

est Air Force Recruiting Office.

HAVE ALWAYS HAD an
ony hatred for the bottom crust
of rye bread. There is no particular
reason for making this point, except
that whenever I think of Fort
Lauderdale, I think of rye bread.
There is no particular reason for that
either, but I have been thinking of
Fort Lauderdale. Fort Lauderdale is
“where the boys are.’ Right now,
that is. Most of the time, serenity
reigns in Fort Lauderdale. (The
Chamber of Commerce will hate me;
they say it never rains in Fort
Lauderdale.) But, for two weeks,
twenty thousand collegians descend
on this peaceful community and take
it apart, peace by peace. They call
it Spring Vacation, but it’s more like
amateur night at Cape Canaveral.
They capture Florida and throw the
Keys away. But I shouldn’t joke—
not while people are holding mass
prayer meetings for an early hurri-
cane season.

This is “where the boys a...’ And
girls, too. Such girls, it makes you
dizzy to look at them. If you look long
enough, you reach an advanced
stage of dizziness called aphro-
dizzier. It’s like being in love. That’s
what happened to me, and it will
happen to you, too. Everywhere you
turn — beaches full of them, motels
and hotels full of them, cars full of
them, pools full of them, bathing
suits full of them. Ah, bathing suits

. when the man said, “It’s the
little things in life that count,” he
must have been thinking of bathing
suits, But mostly, it’s the girls.

Girls in love, girls in trouble, bright
girls with a future, not-so-bright
girls with a past, rich girls in the lap
of luxury, poor girls in any lap
that’ll have them, girls of every size
and discretion. It isn’t any wonder
that this is “where the boys are.”
And the things that happen are
wacky and wild and wicked and
warmly wonderful “where the boys
are.” Someone should make a movie
about it. Hey, someone did! M-G-M
calls it ‘“‘Where The Boys Are,”
starring Dolores Hart, George Hamil-
ton, Yvette Mimieux, Jim Hutton,
Barbara Nichols, Paula Prentiss, with
Frank Gorshin and introducing popu-
lar recording star Connie Francis
in her first screen role. You'll

want to see all the things
that happen ‘‘Where The
Boys Are.”

sider buying his way into Great
Britain’s auto industry because to do
so would adversely affect our balance
of payments seems rather ill advised.
Mr. Ford, being a businessman, is
certainly not throwing away all those
dollars just to make our balance of
payments look bad.

I would imagine he expects to real-
ize a fair return from that money for
himself and his American stockholders.
Any temporary harm that comes from
looking at the balance sheet should
bear in mind the greater return.

The new “Gold Dollar Widow
Order” for dependents of American
troops, “our soldiers are used to hard-
ships, they won’t mind,” or the of-
fensive “Buy America” acts rely on
the same type of budget-infested
thinking that hunts for narrow ra-
tionale and simple solutions.
