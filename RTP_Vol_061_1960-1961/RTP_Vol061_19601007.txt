It seems appropriate at this time to call to the at-
tention of all social groups on the campus the following
statement issued by the Administrative Committee of
the Faculty in October, 1959:

1. It is specifically understood that the prohibition
by the Board of Trustees of physical punishment in con-
nection with fraternity initiations applies specifically to
all student groups on the campus.

2. It is further understood that no demonstration of
conduct discreditable to the institution will be permitted
on the part of any social fraternities or clubs.

3. It is understood that any violations of either of the
two above stated conditions would merit immediate abol-
ishing of the offending organization.

FRANK J. GILLIAM, Chairman

Administrative Committee

It is not the purpose of an editorial to harass or browbeat—
we are perhaps more aware of this than our readers are. Rather,
we feel an editorial should serve worthwhile intentions and strive
for gains otherwise publicly unheralded.

With this in mind, consider the spirit in which the following

This university is one of adequate capacity whose goal
is never static. Its serious minded students are joining with dedi-
cated administrators and faculty to meet the demands of a good
education—this we all know and will continue to praise. Our
progress has recently become an accelerating phenomenon
which we witness with zeal and pride.

For anything worthwhile to exist on the campus of Wash-
ington and Lee, it must cherish a definite purpose—one which
has the welfare and education of a mature individual in mind.
This is the incentive for our progress. It is presently complicated
by the presence of customs, groups and institutions which are
undesirable and fail to approach the high standards of this
university, although they have enjoyed a period of considerable
longevity.

The various and vigorous adminstrative branches of this
university, be they student or faculty, have undertaken to re-
move such undesirable facets of Washington and Lee life.

Each year academic and social idealism is shattered with
the appearance of the “honorary societies” and their rites upon
this campus. Members of the sophomore class have been sub-
jected to brutal paddling, the selected junior initiates undergo
somewhat the same physical abuse, and “mature” seniors along

There can be no obvious justification for such practices. The
college at large suffers from these “recognition” or “puberty”
ceremonies long after the voluntary initiates’ bruises and
wounds are healed.

We would like to cite several points from the notice that ap-
peared on the ODK board which we have printed above. The
ruling of the Administrative Committee of the Faculty in con-
junction with that of the Board of Trustees specifically states
its jurisdiction over violations in connection with initiations of
all student groups on campus and not just those organizations
which openly flaunted their membership.

Secondly, the declaration forbids any demonstration of con-
duct discreditable to the institution. The fame that these or-
ganizations bring to Washington and Lee should be avoided at
any cost. They are definitely liabilities to an adult environ-
ment—especially to a university in which academic assets are
paramount such as ours.

If these organizations, PAN, White Friars, the ‘‘13’’ Club,
and Sigma, (along with those organizations that have no
known name) can show logical justification for their permance
here then let it be recorded. Otherwise let us as a Twentieth

 

with flattered juniors are branded with a hot iron.

 

Century University discard this Medieval dross.

Pigskin, Rally, Girls
Spark Homecomings

A Pep Rally, which has been three
weeks in the planning, will officially
open Homecomings activities to-
night at 7:30.

The rally which has been planned
by the Varsity Club in conjunction
with the IFC will begin with the
introduction of the candidates for
Homecoming Queen. Following sev-
eral cheers, led by the cheerleaders,
Coach McLaughlin will make some
comments.

comings displays will be judged.
This judging will be done by an im-
partial committee whose member-
ship is not disclosed at this time.
The first display judging will be at
8:30 Friday evening, and another
will follow on Saturday morning.
The winners will be announced at
half-time of the game Saturday and
will be presented with prizes from
the Washington and Lee Alumni As-
sociation. These prizes, which are on
display at the College Town Shop,
are: first prize, a silver tray; second
prize, W&L chair; third prize, gift
certificate for records from White’s
Music Shop; fourth prize, a large
wooden salad bowl.

Delta Tau Delta has captured first
prize for Homecomings displays for
the past three years.

All fraternities are required to
have their candidates for Queen at
the gym by 7:15 tonight and at
Wilson Field Saturday at 1:30.

Torchlight Parade

Following the Rally, the freshman
torchlight parade through town will
begin. The parade is to go east on
Washington street, turn south on Lee
avenue, east on Nelson street, north
at Main street, and then left at
Henry street which will take it
through Red Square.

Each fraternity may have two
decorated cars in the parade. One of
these cars is to carry the Home-
comings Queen candidate. Officials
request that the cars be in line by
7:15.

Judging for the Spirit Trophy, won
last year by the Phi Gams, will be-
gin at the parade. Judging for the
trophy will be based on the par-
ticipation of the entire fraternity, not
just the pledge class, officials say.

“Quite Pleased”

Head cheerleader, Steve Danzan-
sky, had this to say in reference to
the Pep Rally: “We are quite pleased
with the general enthusiasm which
has been shown for the Pep Rally
thus far this week. We hope to be-
gin a resurgance of spirit at W&L
with this rally, but it can only be
accomplished with the support of the
entire student body.”

Also on Friday night, the Home-

Saturday Events
Saturday activities begin with an
Alumni coffee in the morning. The
Alumni Fund Council will also meet
| Saturday morning to discuss the an-
nual solicitation for the alumni fund.
The Alumni Association will be
host to the alumni at a noon lunch-
eon in Evans Dining Hall. Three
hundred and fifty to 400 persons,
including Alumni Association presi-
dent Mr. Paul Shuford, are expect-

ed to attend the luncheon.

Kick-off at Two

Kick-off time for the football game

German Works
In Shenandoah

The Fall issue of Shenandoah,
Washington and Lee University’s lit-
erary magazine, will be centered
around an examination of contem-
porary German literary creativity.

Under the editorship of Dr. Wil-
liam W. Pusey, Dean of the College
and chairman of Washington and
Lee’s department of German the
volume will feature a collection of
previously unpublished translations
of contemporary German literary
achievements.

In cooperation with the Inter
Nationes in Bonn, Germany, Dr.
Pusey has assembled six short stories,
one written by Heinrich Boll, the
author of three novels which are
currently available on American
newsstands in translation.

Three poems with original Ger-
man texts will be found in the Fall
Shenandoah, which is scheduled for
publication sometime during the first
week of November.

Three essays will fill out the rest
of this volume, one of four issues of
Shenandoah at Washington and Lee.
The essays will deal with the topics
of “Modern German Literature,”
“The German University,” and “Ger-
man Music.”

The Washington and Lee litar-
ary magazine has featured in the
past such writers as William Faulk-
ner, Katherine Anne Porter, Arnold
Toynbee and others.

Sprunt Named Member
Of State Religious Group

Dr. David W. Sprunt, associate
dean of students and chairman of
the department of religion at Wash-

Alumni Fund
To Be Discussed

The Alumni Fund Council of
Washington and Lee University’s
Alumni Association will meet dur-
ing homecoming activities Saturday
to consider a re-emphasis of fund
raising for the association.

The seven-man council will meet
at 9:30 am. Saturday to discuss
new fund-raising methods for the
alumni fund, which has been inac-
tive during Washington and Lee’s
nearly-completed capital funds cam-
paign.

The council meeting will follow
the 9 a.m. registration of the more
than 400 alumni and guests expected
for Washington and Lee’s annual
homecoming weekend.

Highlight of the homecoming
weekend will be the football game
between Washington and Lee and
Franklin and Marshall College
scheduled for 2 p.m. on the univer-
sity’s Wilson Field. For the first
time in several years two marching
bands will be present for a Wash-
ington and Lee game. The Frank-
lin and Marshall band will be on
hand along with the Halifax High
School marching band. The W&L

 

Pep Band will assist.

The game will be preceded by an}
alumni luncheon at noon in the
Evans Dining Hall.

* extravaganza has hit the scene. That

show that has for ages touched the
hearts of old and young alike will
make another of its thrilling and
chilling exhibitions here on the
campus.

Pearce Hardwick, President of the
Dance Set, announced this afternoon
that the never-dying circus show will
illuminate the walls of the Dore-
mus Gymnasium on the evening of
October 28 for the Formal Dance of
the weekend. He mentioned that the
theme is an old one to those who
will attend but it will be new here
at Washington and Lee.

Reworking Gym

There has been a complete re-
working of the decor of the gym
in that the age-old false ceiling
which has been used in the past has
been replaced by an attractive tent
top arrangement which will add im-
mensely to the atmosphere.

Another change is that the idea
of centering the affair around one
object has been abandoned. Every
aspect of the occasion of Oct. 28
will be worked in so that there is an
equal distribution of entertainment
throughout the dance hall. However,
Hardwick emphasized that the at-
mosphere will not be in the tradi-
tional gaudy colors of the circus but
will be of a somewhat subdued na-
ture.

A continuous mural will decorate
one wall of the gymnasium, empha-
sizing the three rings in which the

Homecomings 1960

Tonight the extravaganza that we anticipate to be Home-
comings begins. A result of much planning, the well organized
and sponsored Pep Rally and Parade will initiate what we hope
will be a weekend of currently unequaled spirit.

 

The series of events leading up to Saturday’s game have
one primary purpose. This is not the entertainment of old
graduates although such a function is a necessary part of
Homecomings. The purpose of Homecomings 1960 is to pro-
vide another link in the chain of progress which seeks to im-
prove the direction of a student at Washington and Lee. By
attempting to unite the exuberance of a student body and there-
by dispell its apathy, Homecomings will record its contribution.

The university has a football team of which it can be justly
proud, but the pride and spirit generated this weekend should
not and will not culminate with, and then disintegrate after,
the game tomorrow.

At long last there are those at this university who are con-
verting idealism into practice. The ramifications of this conver-
sion are becoming evident daily. Athletics is just one of the
many areas which are approaching desired fulfillment.

We urge the student body at large to join with those indi-
viduals who are promoting this university as well as its teams
and make “our” Homecomings an outstanding success.

Progress And Problems

We would like to commend our president, Dr. Fred C.
Cole, for the long awaited reformation in McCormick Library
which he has instituted.

Cognizant of student needs, Dr. Cole first eliminated the
inadaquate lighting in the library, replacing the archaic globes
with an abundance of excellent modern fixtures.

Secondly, the extension of library hours in the evenings
from 10:30 to 12:00 especially accommodates the academic
needs of students. This extra hour and a half will prove itself
an exceptional asset to our community.

Last year, the Ring-tum Phi suggested the renovation of
the second floor room known as the “Gallery,” a step which
we heartily endorse at this time.

There remains, however, a library problem not resolved.
Regardless of the excellent reforms, there is a dramatic need
for space—both for studying and research work.

This room affords a floor space similar in measurement to
the two reading rooms down stairs and would support ample
table and shelf room.

Presently, the room serves no concrete purpose. Its one-
time function of exhibiting painting was eliminated with the
construction of the duPont Hall Gallery.

We feel that the administration recognizes this need for
additional space in the library, and we hope that the problem
will be approached with the characteristic vigor and awareness
that met the other deficiencies in the library.

A Gentleman

We are morally obligated to the Washington and Lee tra-
ditions. This obligation came to us at the same time our ac-
ceptance into this institution did. Most of us make an honest
effort to meet our obligation; the few of us who do not are
reminded to do so by the Assimilation Committee.

One freshman recently carried the fulfillment of his ob-
ligation to perfection. Through his one act the entire freshman
class expressed its assimilation into the student body. The fresh-
man assimilated himself for not wearing a tie to class. Needless
to say, the Assimilation Committee was more than duly im-
pressed.

This freshman, in an act which some would call naive or
even “stupid,”’ turned his name in because he felt a moral ob-
ligation to the tradition. He said so. And he was not being naive
or stupid, he was being a better W&L Gentleman than the rest
of us can ever hope to be. If the remainder of the student body
had his attitude, there would be no need for an assimilation
committee, cold check committee, or a judicial meeting of the
Executive Committee.

It is true, too, that the freshmen have better assimilated
themselves into the student body. Only 18 cases of failure to
wear the beanie have come before the committee this year.
We understand that the average number of cases per week last
year exceeded 18.

Such facts show the freshmen are adapting themselves well.
Indeed, they seem to be more respectful of traditions than the
upperclassmen. Will it be necessary that we of the upperclasses
learn respect for our traditions from those who follow us?

—G. E. H.

We Agree

In conjunction with the editorial written in the Tuesday
edition of the Ring-tum Phi, we would like to vigorously en-
dorse Mr. Page’s suggestion that the staffs of the Ring-tum Phi
be provided with the necessary quarters in which to prepare
the newspaper.

Both the Tuesday and Friday staffs are handicapped due
to the present situation and a certain amount of inefficiency re-
sults,

To expedite the publishing of the Ring-tum Phi and to elim-
inate definite and recurring print shop headaches, we join in
Tuesday’s plea for an adequate office.

THE RING-TUM PHI

By ROY GOODWIN
Assistant Managing Editor

As the old saying goes, “Movies
Are Better than Ever.” This saying,
however, doesn’t seem to have much
effect on the Washington and Lee
Student body.

Both of Lexington’s motion pic-
ture theatres are apparently doing
little or next to no business at all
with the W&L student body, Lex-
ington’s two theatre managers said
today.

No Freshman Support
What are the reasons for the empty
theatres?
Ed Side, owner and manager of
the Lyric Theatre, answered the
question by saying, “We don’t see
the freshmen around any more.”
“They've apparently been indoc-
trinated by the school,” Side said
“but not by the movies.”

Ralph I. Daves, manager of Stan-
ley Warner’s State Theatre, agreed
with Side in saying that his business
had been hurt by an apparent lack |
of freshman support.

Commons Is Problem

As for the cause of the downfall
of the formerly large “flick teams,”
both managers agreed that the Com-
mons and the strengthening of Wash-
ington and Lee academically have
had a great deal to do with it.
“Since freshmen are now eating
in the Commons,” Side said, “and
are no longer eating in the fraterni-
ties, the upperclassmen are not
‘chaperoning’ the freshman when
they go to the movies.”

As State Theatre’s Daves said,
“The freshmen are, it seems to me,
not out in town for their meals,
and are isolated on the hill.”

More Studying Now
The Lyric’s manager, Side, said
that he thought that the freshmen
are no longer heading for the movies:

 

Commons and Books En

 

because they are “heading for the
books!”

Daves said that he thought that
two things were causing the slowup
at the movies. There are, he said,
more for the students to do now with

, competition from television, sports,

and more general activities.
The second reason, he said was
the books.

Old Flick Teams Fail

When asked if they were still see-
ing the formerly large “flick teams,”
both managers agreed that the teams
have now dwindled to almost noth-
ing.

“We never see the great masses
we used to see,” Side added.

Flick Teams

maybe the flick teams haven't elected
captains yet. There was a note of
optimism in his voice.

Quality the Same

As for quality of the pictures that
the houses are now playing, both
managers agreed that the quality
of the pictures that they are getting
is just as good, if not better, than
formerly.

Side said that he thought that
the quality of the movies had little
or nothing to do with this case.
“We're getting the same quality of
movies,” he said, “that we’ve always
gotten.”

Daves said that his theatre was

“We have to play a movie,” he
said, “for a length of time because
the purchase of the right to show a
movie calls for it. This, he added, is
the reason for the long-run movies
in Lexington.”

Both Side and Daves have a
number of top movies that are com-
ing to Lexington in the near fu-
ture. They both expressed their
hopes that students attendance will
improve.

According to Daves “Ben Hur”
will be at the State probably around
the first of January.

 

 

By ROBERT C. KETCHAM
and VICTOR K. LASSITER

In this campaign so pregnant with
issues which remain to plague the
student the most frequent accusa-
tions being slung about campus are
the slogans, Socialist and Welfare
State. This effort to find labels which
destroy the particulars in a debate
is prevelant on one side of this
campaign and typical of the negative
thinking in evidence.

The conservative, negative ap-
proach is to oppose all progressive
and needed legislation such as aid
to education, public housing, high-
way building and development of
natural resources because only by
resisting any and all legislation do
they think that they can keep from
becoming engulfed. Not that Re-
publicans are not for this or that
measure per se, but they are afraid
of the forwardness of the movement
and resort to sticking names on the
total concept of progress. This at-
tempt has been used before: Re-
publicans have flayed these tired
slogans for such progressive pub-
lic programs as the Federal Re-
serve System, the Federal Land
Bank System, an eight-hour day on
railroads, child labor legislation, soil
conservation, social security and
TVA. Such labelogy might conform
to the Zeitgeist, but it is poor think-
ing and evades the issue.

Prime Example

Richard Nixon gives a prime ex-
ample with his search for identity:
while trying to give himself a lib-
eral gloss by aligning himself with
Rockefeller he seeks to identify the
policies of the Eisenhower admin-
istration with his own image; an
obvious fallacy. John Kennedy’s
energy, fresh approach and _ intel-
lectual breadth is a more realistic
approach to the difficulties that are
facing us. He does not avert an
issue when he says, “the harsh facts
of the matter are that we as a na-
tion face a hard, tough course ahead.”

In the field of foreign affairs there
is more evidence of the difference
between the Democratic and the Re-
publican parties and the relative po-
sition and concept of each party.
Nixon has come out with a catchy
phrase in regards to our nation’s
present dilemma: “A record is not

 

something to stand on, it is some-

Constructive and Dynamic
Kennedy Is For America

thing to build on.” The sad fact of

the matter is that we have been,

merely standing, not building, dur-
ing the last seven and a half years,
and we have been standing on a
rather shaky fence at that.

Maintain Status Quo

The Republican party and the
Eisenhower Administration have
tried to maintain the status quo in-
stead of building up US. prestige
and strength of the free world. The
U.S. has manifested absolutely no
positive program of foreign policy;
for example, Eisenhower’s blunder
in walking into the Japanese riots,
the uncoordinated lies over the U-2
incident, and the administration’s
failure to comprehend the left-wing
situation in Cuba during the latter
years of the Batista regime.

On the other hand, Senator Ken-
nedy has constantly manifested a
position of constructive thinking and
positive action in the field of for-
eign relations. Senator Kennedy is
chairman of the Senate foreign re-
lations subcommittee on Africa, and
is an authority on foreign affairs in
general.

Kennedy's Works

Senator Kennedy has written Why
England Slept, The Strategy of
Peace, and a booklet entitled A
Nation of Immigrants in addition to
three articles: “A Democrat Looks at
Foreign Policy,” Foreign Affairs; “If
India Falls,” The Reporter; and
“Foreign Policy is the People’s Busi-
ness,” N.Y. Times Magazine. Mr.
Nixon has also published some work
in this field: The Challenge We Face
(a collection of speeches), and an
article published in the Reader’s Di-
gest, “Legacy of John Foster Dulles.”

Forecful Leadership

A dynamic, forceful leadership in
this country will require sacrifice on
the part of the people, despite Mr.
Nixon’s implications to the con-
trary. To regain our prestige in the
world and our economic strength at
home we need leadership rooted in
character and responsibility. In this
national election we would like to
believe that the persons who feel the
need for national strength, prestige
and development would not be con-
fused by the labels used by a party

 

in their fight for complacency.

 

Vann Praises Library Reforms;

Doesn’t Like Locked Shelves

By JAMES VANN
Friday Columnist

This year has seen a number of
much needed and well deserved re-
forms in the Mc-
Cormick Library.
This is only one
indication of the
new era that is
coming to the
University and the
student body has
reason to expect
that these imp-
provements’ will
only be the begin-
ning of many long
awaited changes.
Not only have new lights been in-
stalled in the library reading rooms,
but the stacks and the reading rooms
are now to remain open until mid-
night.

Needed Improvements

As has been said earlier these are
certainly much needed improve-
ments and they should help each
student in his studies. Yet more im-
portant ,these reforms show that the
university is willing to do its part
in providing opportunities for the
student body. But, the question now
remains up for debate as to whether
the students will do their part to
fulfill their part of the contract.
Unfortunately it looks as though
there are still some benighted people
who don’t realize the nature of their
contract—particularly as far as the
Library is concerned.

be even more flagrant and yet it is
here that the THEFTS have even
more lethal results. For example, in
an advanced German class, the pro-
fessor told his students that due to
the difficulty and antiquity of much
of the German they would be trans-
lating, the students might find it
necessary throughout the year to
consult profesisonal translations. He
mentioned that there were several
of these translations available in
the library but there were two of
especial importance and value which
he had placed on reserve. Well, the
words were hardly out of the man’s
mouth before the books were taken—
stolen if you please—from the re-
serve shelf. What’s now to become
of the other students who will need
to consult the books! Its just their
tough luck and one student now
has it always at his convenience.

Locked Shelves

Because of incidents just like this
the faculty and Mr. Coleman have
had to resort to something that no
school which makes such a to-do
about being gentlemen should have
and that’s a locked reserve shelf. The
books that several students need now
have to be placed under lock and
key so the gentlemen won’t make off
with them and one of the library
staff must now spend half his time
locking and unlocking books. This to
me is something that should hardly
be necessary if one is dealing wih
gentlemen, for sneak thievery is
hardly compatible with anyone’s
definition of gentlemanly conduct.

“Only Borrowing”

Many seem to look on the library
rules—rules that are necessary to
enable the library to run with an
efliciency—as cumbersome obstacles
in the way of their own success. It
seems absurd to some that the mag-
azines or Encyclopedias aren’t al-
lowed out of the building and so they
have no hesitation at all about
simply taking them back to their| {amber 2, 146 at the Post Ofice, Lex:

at their leisure—to hell with the
others who need them. If one were
to accost these violators with the
accusation of stealing, they would
swell with righteous indignation—af-
ter all, they were only “borrowing.”

Generals Face F&M In Homecoming Tomorrow

Stingy Defense Will Be Deciding Factor In W&L’s Bid For 3rd Sidi Win

Washington and Lee’s stubborn defense will step out of
the shadows into the spotlight tomorrow when the Generals
tackle Franklin and Marshall’s Diplomats in W&L’s home-
coming here at 2 p.m.

The Generals’ defense, headed by guards Tommy Good-
win and Bill Willes, linebacker Terry Fohs, end Windy Weed,
and tackle Bill Wheeler, completely stalled the Dickinson
ground attack last week.

But this stonewall defense, which has given up 171
yards in two games, has drawn the unenviable task of
trying to derail F&M’s ground express, 165-pound scat-
back John Tomasko.

After watching Tomasko gallop 82 yards from scrimmage
for a touchdown against Johns Hopkins last Saturday, W&L
assistant coach Boyd Williams said:

““He’s the kind of runner who’s likely to put six points on
the scoreboard any time he carries. He’s one of the best small
college runners I’ve ever seen.”

But Tomasko’s touchdown sprint didn’t help the Diplomats
get on the win trail as Johns Hopkins eked out a 12-6 victory
on the game’s last play. The Diplomats lost their opening game
to Denison, 34-14.

Tomasko is the main cog in the Diplomat’ s revamp-
ed backfield, which is p!auged by the a‘sence of an ex-
perienced quarterback.

But the same hefty line that held the Generals in check as
F&M chalked up a 28-14 victory last year is back this year
and will give the game a definite defensive flavor.

In fact, the experts have forecast that one touchdown will
win the game.

In sizing up Franklin and Marshall, W&L Head
Coach Lee McLaughlin said, “Thank goodness (John)

Betrone is gone.”

 

The Generals ready for tomorrow’s game

 

Delts Capture I-M Track

The Delts, Phi Delts, and KA’s captured the first three
places in the intramural track finals Wednesday.

Following them were SAE’s, fourth; DU, fifth; Phi Kappa
g ere
Sigma, sixth; ZBT’s seventh; Sigma*
Nu, eighth; Phi Gams, ninth; and| ppj Gam, in the 440; Nick Everhardt,
SPE’s, tenth. DU, in the 880, and the Betas in
: : : he mile relay.

Dave Britt, Phi Kappa Psi, raced | * y
to a first in both the 100 and 220- | Henry Sackett, SAE, leaped 20-0
yard dashes and took the high to capture first in the broad jump,
jump with a 5-6 leap. Ed Jansen Hobson Morrison, KA, grabbed first
Delt, and John Bloch, KA, captured in the pole vault, and Denins McKay,
pis first each, Jansen took the high Delta Tau Delta, won the javelin.

 

Betrone was the Generals’ undoing in their two previous
meetings with the Diplomats. In 1958 Betrone set up a
touchdown and a 14-13 win with a long punt return in the
game’s closing minutes. Last year the speedy halfback ignited
the Diplomats offensive fireworks when he returned a punt for
a touchdown in the first quarter.

Turning to his own attack, McLaughlin, who is somewhat
dissatisfied with his team’s showing so far, said:

“I feel we still have yet to play a good football game in
terms of our potential. We won our first two games because we
had greater depth, but just once I’d like for us to get a jump
on a team in the first half.”

The Generals, riding a two-game win streak, are
shooting for an unprecedented third straight win in one
season since W&L started its non-subsidized athletic pro-
gram in 1954,

 

 

W&L’s main attraction so far has been its powerful of-
fense which has gained 452 yards on the ground (an aver-
age of 4.7 per carry) in rolling over Centre, 21-6, and Dick-
inson, 23-6. Add to this 172 yards gained on a supposedly
weak passing attack, and the Generals have gained an average
of 315 yards per game.

McLaughlin was highly pleased with the effectiveness of
the Generals’ passing attack against Dickinson. Starting
quarterback Steve Suttle led the way with five completions in
seven attempts for 99 yards.

We’re not going to throw as often as we did last year
with Jack Groner, but I think we’re still going to be a
threat in the air,”” McLaughlin said.

Pacing the W&L running attack are halfback Bob Funk-
| houser and fullbacks Doug Martin and —_- Keesee.

Undefeated, Unscored Upon Bootmen
Tackle Duke Tuesday At Durham

The Washington and Lee Univer-
sity soccer team travels next week
to Durham, N.C., for a mid-South
clash wth the Blue Devils of Duke
University.

The Generals will take the road
with en undefeated and unscored
uoon record next Monday night, and
if pregame predictions hold true
will return with an unmarred 3-0
season.

However, there is but one ob-
stecle in the way of the Blue and
White Booters—and that is subsidiza-
tion. The Blue Devils have been
known to field nothing but impres-
sive looking teams, and Tuesday’s
contest will be no different from
any previous encourter as far as
Coach Joe Lyles or his team can
predict.

Two years ago, in Durham, W&L
bottled to a 3-3 tie during the regu-
lation game period with the Duke
beoters, and in a_ special “fifth
quarter” again matched Duke goal
for goal. ‘lhe outcome was a 4-4
deadlock, although the Generals
should have won had not an intra-
mural whistle confused them.

Last year, in Lexington, Duke was

Dr. Leyburn Speaks On ‘Idols’

By ROBERT SUPER |
Staff Reporter

Dr. James Leyburn spoke to the
UCA held Wednesday in the fresh-
man dorm. His topic was the “Idols!
of the Campus”: conservatism, popu- |
larity, conformity, apathy, and self-
centeredness. He warned freshmen
that “If you aren't aware of them
[the idols] yet, you soon will be.”

Dr. Leyburn stressed the import-
ance of individuality and self-assess- |
ment, especially in the freshman |
year. He noted that a certain amount |
of conformity is required by W&L|
traditions, but that conformity of |
thought stamps out individualism, |
and that conservatism means “not |
to have the mind stretched by sub-|
jects never taken before.”

“Grade-chasing”

Dr. Leyburn expressed his view
that the rather limited choice of |
courses available to freshmen, many |
of which aren’t so very different |
from high school subjects, can help!
lead to conformity by precluding
much “stretching” of the mind by
new ideas. Also pointed out was the
danger of “grade-chasing,” or learn-

The Mongolian Minks are expected

Assimilation Committee that they
may remove their beanies—if the
news is to come. Partington and the
committee have remained silent on
the beanies, and some have expressed
doubt that the event will come.

After the game, there will be an
alumni reception on the mezzanine
of the Robert E. Lee Hotel.

Several fraternities have also plan-
ned a cocktail party for their alumni
later in the day.

Also scheduled for Saturday after-

Dr. Leyburn emphasized  self-

centeredness as the most dangerous |

idol of all. He predicts that many
freshmen will soon be confronted
with a number of problems, many of
them new to his experience; prob-
lems and worries concerning his fra-
ternity, his parents, his girl, and
his work. It is all too easy to spend
a great deal of time thinking of
one’s self, and to consider one’s
own problems of tremendous im-
portance. This, he warned can easily
lead to self-centeredness.

Wes Roberts can tell you:

“THERE’S NO CEILING FOR A SELF-STARTER
IN THE TELEPHONE BUSINESS”

When Wes Roberts was nearing the end of
his senior year at San Jose State College, he was
looking for a job with a wide open future. He
found it when he joined Pacific Telephone in

Here’s how Wes tells it: ‘I remember one of
my first jobs. The boss said, ‘Wes, I want you
to work out a plan showing where we'll need
new field operating centers to keep up with
Northern California’s growth over the next 10
years.’ I didn’t know whether I was more happy

Wes didn’t tell us (but his boss did) that he
handled the report like a pro. And today, as a

FREDERICK R. KAPPEL, President

American Telephone & Telegraph Co,

 

division supervisor, he’s holding down a key

telephone job.

Wes Roberts’ story is not unique in the Bell
Telephone Companies. The telephone business
is growing fast—and men are needed who can

grow just as fast.

Wes can tell you: “We get

good training.

But no one nurses you along. We hire managers
—not errand boys. So far as I can see, there’s no
ceiling for a self-starter in this business.”

If you're a guy like Wes Roberts—if you like
to bite off more than you can chew and then chew
it— you'll want to visit your Placement Office for
literature and additional information.

“Our number one aim is to have in all
management jobs the most vital, intelli-
gent, positive and imaginative men we
can possibly find.”
