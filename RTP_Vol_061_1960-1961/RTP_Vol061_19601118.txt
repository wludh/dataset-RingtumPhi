Thirty - Three
On Honor Roll
At Mid-Semester

Midsemester reports show that 33
students have made the Honor Roll.
These 33 students represent an in-
crease of seven over those students
making last year’s midsemester Honor
Roll.

Of these 33 students. 30 of them are
upperclassmen, while three are fresh-
men. Twenty-four upperclassmen and
two freshmen made the midsemester
Honor Roll last year, while 22 upper-
classmen and two freshmen posted the
necessary 2.5 average or better in the
fall of 1959.

The seniors led the school with
the largest number of honor students,
17, and the juniors were next with
13. The freshmen and sophomores
tied for third place with three honor
students apiece.

The following seniors made the Hon-
or Roll: C. L. Anderson, J. W. Atwell,
J. A. Broaddus, D. P. Danko, S. I.
Danzansky, H. H. Harrell, S. Haw-
kins, T. C. Imeson, C. R. Mauzy, G.
P. Pardington, B. E. Pierce, J. G. Pow-
ell, M. F. Schwartz (all A’s), N. P. B.
Simpson, J. A. Vann, B. H. Vitsky,
and E. G. Webster.

Juniors making the Honor Roll are
S. R. Chernay, J. L. Goldstein (all A’s),
J. W. McClung, W. M. McKim, G. R.
McNab, S. M. Painter, J. C. Parker,
S. W. Rutledge, H. L. Slater, and

Two Professors

Are Speaking

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw, professor of
history at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, will attend a Civil War Round
Table conference this weekend at
Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, Pa.

He will be one of eight college pro-
fessors who will speak at the confer-

Fines Upped To $30
By Library Committee

Due to recurrent violations of li-
brary policy, the Executive Commit-
tee has granted the Student Library
Committee increased fining powers.

The maximum fine for violation
of rules of the library committee has
been increased to $30.00. Formerly,
the maximum fine for an offense was

$5.00.

Brian Vitsky, chairman of the Stu-
dent Library Committee, stated that
this increased fine was necessary be-
cause of the continuing disregard of
the rule of the library committee in-
volving unauthorized removal. He also
stated: “Concern has been expressed
by Mr. Coleman and by the Faculty
Library Committee, as well as by many
professors with reserve shelves in the
library, that this rule is constantly
broken by students.”

According to Vitsky, books and per-
iodicals have been removed without
being properly checked out. The li-
brary committee stressed the fact that
the purpose of this rule is to keep
books available to all students who!

 

have need for them.

The previous $5.00 fine seemed to
be a small threat to many students
so the EC found its recent step neces-
sary. Vitsky emphasized that al-
though the $30 is a maximum fine,
the committee will not be lenient
with deliberate violators. He added
that if the unauthorized removal
constitutes deliberate stealing, it be-
comes an honor offense to be delt
with by the Executive Committee.

In addition to unauthorized removal,
there are three other violations of
committee rules: hiding; mutilation
and destruction; and excessive noise.
Other members of the Student Library
Committee are: Joe Goldstein, Pete
Agelasto, Craig Distellhorst, Dick
Hoover, Herb Salomon, Milford
Schwartz, and Jim Stott.

Vitsky urges all students to help
enforce the library rules. The viola-
tions boxes are located in McCormick
Library and in the chemistry library.
The rules of the committee apply in
all of the university libraries.

 

Col. McLaughlin Emphasizes Sino-Soviet Threat
In Lecture On Army Tuesday Evening In Lee Chapel

Col. Charles V. McLaughlin spoke
before a large crowd of ROTC Cadet
Corps and other interested people last
Tuesday night in Lee Chapel.

In discussing the Army’s role in
planning for modern warfare, he placed
special emphasis on the Sino-Soviet
threat, and called for a flexible mili-
tary response which would provide for
the application of measured force ade-
quate to respond to all aspects of the
threat.

He emphasized the obligation of the
U.S. military forces to prevent Com-
munist inroads anywhere in the world,
and, in doing so, deter all forms of
military conflict. If the deterence part
of planning should fail, the forces of
the United States must be able to
win any type of war, whether of con-
ventional or nuclear nature.

As the two basie principles of high
level planning responsibilities he men-
tioned continual study and vigilance.

 

Fiiis Win Blood-Drive Keg
For Fourth Straight Time |

A Red Cross Blood Drive was spon-
sored at the University this past
Wednesday. John Mullin, a KA soph-
omore from Atlanta, Ga., represented
the IFC and the local Red Cross
worker, Mrs. Adhouser, in seeing that
things went according to schedule.

Mullin reported that the quota of
one hundred and twenty-five pints was
almost reached during the course of
the afternoon’s blood letting.

Of the eighteen fraternities, the
Fijis and the Delts proved to be the
most generous. The former gave thirty-
five pints and the latter eighteen, Thus
for the fourth year in a row, Phi

He reminded the audience that this
high level planning is a very com-
plex and responsible process. The se-
curity policy worked out in this
planning was intended to preserve the
people of the nation, their fundamen-
tal values, institutions, and culture.

As for the Army, specifically, the
program’s purpose is to insure that it
is prepared to conduct prompt and
sustained operations on land, the tra-
ditional role of the United States Army,
as the ground-gaining arm of our de-
fenses.

 

Hollins Cotillion

Opens Tonight
With Morrow

By JOHN KIRKLEY
Assistant News Editor

The Hollins Cotillion, an annual
fling for the young ladies, will be
held tonight and tomorrow. The big
weekend will include two dances at
the Hotel Roanoke, a Saturday after-
noon concert, a Sunday brunch, and,
delight of delights, Open House in
the Hollins dorms on Saturday after-
noon,

Buddy Morrow and his band will
perform at the formal dance which
will be held Friday evening from 10
until 2 in the ballroom of the Hotel
Roanoke,

Morrow’s band has produced such
famous songs as “Night Train,” “One
Mint Julep,” and “I Don’t Know.” In
addition to the regular music, there
will be the outstanding musical vir-
tuosity of Buddy Morrow on the
trombone. His skill is evident in such
famous pieces as “Tara’s Theme” from
Gone With the Wind.

Morrow’s musical repertoire includes
the whole spectrum of popular music
from early dixieland, rhythm and
blues, and intricate ballads to full pro-
gressive jazz interpretations.

The Four Freshmen, a popular group
here at W&L, will entertain the ladies
and their escorts at the concert, which
is to be given Saturday afternoon.

Saturday evening the McCoy Broth-
ers, a group new to the entertainment
field, will play for the informal dance.
Again the dance will be in the Hotel
Roanoke ballroom; this time however,
it will last from 8 until midnight.

Usually, there is at least one fatal |
accident during this time. Charles F.
Murray, the university proctor, urges
all W&L students to observe safe driv-
ing over the weekend. Students, he
said, should be extra careful if the
roads are foggy or wet.

 

Glasgow Lecturers ‘Here
Between Nov. 28--Dec. 9

Three professional writers will visit
the Washington and Lee campus be-
tween Nov. 28 and Dec. 9 under the
auspices of the Glasgow Endowment
Fund.

Noted poet John Ciardi, novelist |

William Humphrey, and _television-
screen writer Merle Miller come to

W&L for a series of public addresses |
and classroom discussion, says Dr. Ross |
Borden, chairman of the Glasgow com- |

mittee. Each of the writers will de-
velop themes centered around their
particular fields. The whole series will
deal with the “problem of the arts and
the public.”

The appearance of these writers
on campus will mark the second ap-
plication of the “Arthur and Margaret
Glasgow Endowment,” a fund estab-
lished at Washington and Lee in 1957
“to promote the art of expression by
pen and tongue” at the university.

 

Ciardi, currently professor of Eng-
lish at Rutgers University,

 

will be'

here Nov. 28-30 as the first of the
Glasgow-sponsored visitors. Hum-
phrey will be here Nov. 30-Dec. 2 and
Miller will speak Dec. 7-9.

Cairdi was born in Boston and is
a fellow in the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences and the National
Institute of Arts and Letters.

Novelist Humphrey is the author
of Home From the Hill, published in
1957. He had a volume of short stories
published two years before his novel.

Miller is the author of four novels
and a non-fiction work. He has had
television credits with Playhouse 90
and an NBC special production on the
life of Ira Hays. He wrote the screen
adaptations for “Rains of Ranchipur”

| F. Phillips,

 

and “Kings Go Forth.”

Funds unexpended in the actual ad- |
ministration of the Glasgow program |
accumulate as a Glasgow Publications |
Fund. It will be used for publishing |
of the persons under the endowment
and students in the program.

W&L Seniors
Visit Exchange

Twenty-four Washington and Lee
University seniors enrolled in ad-
vanced economics courses will tour
the New York Stock Exchange Tues-
day and Wednesday in a specially ar-
ranged visit.

The students—all enrolled in invest-
ment and business cycles courses in
the university School of Commerce and
Business Administration—will also visit
two stock brokerage firms and other
New York financial companies.

The trip, the ninth such for busi-
ness and commerce seniors, will in-
clude an unprecedented visit of the
floor of the Stock Exchange, according
to Dr. L. W. Adams, dean of the School
of Commerce and Business Adminis-
tration.

 

 

 

Public Utilities Fortnightly
Carries Dr. Phillips’ Article

A discussion of “Regulation in a
Competitive Economy” by Dr. Charles
Jr., assistant professor
of economics at Washington and Lee
University, will appear in the Nov.
24 issue of Public Utilities Fortnightly.

The article is a revision of a paper
Dr. Phillips presented in September
at an economics symposium at Har-
per’s Ferry, W. Va. The symposium
was sponsored by The Chesapeake
and Potomac Telephone Companies.

Dr. Phillips argues in his article that
“the regulation of public utilities must
be more efficient and flexible if pub-
lic utilities are to survive.”

Public Utilities Fortnightly is dis-
tributed nationally to management
personnel and college libraries.

Dr. Phillips, a member of the Wash-
ington and Lee faculty since 1959,
is the author of eight articles for other
economic journals. His current field
of research is government regulation
of business.

He received his A.B. degree in 1956

from the University of New Hampshire. |

He earned his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
from Harvard University.

Carter Fox Gives Seminar

Carter Fox, a KA senior from Aylett,
Va., spoke to a Chemistry Seminar to-
day at 5 p.m. His subject was “Pre-
stressed Concrete.”

A tea was served at 4:30, followed
by Fox’s talk.

In his talk, he pointed out the
qualities of pre-stressed concrete and
its use as a building material.

* Concerto No. 3 in G. Major, Symphony

No. 2 in D Major by Johannes Brahms.
Prelude for Strings, a composition
by W&L’s own Prof. Robert Stewart
will be played also.

Prof. Stewart’s Prelude was written
for the 1959 Southeastern Conference
and was first performed at the sym-
posium by the University of Alabama
Symphony Orchestra conducted by
Mr. Sopkin. The Prelude is being in-
cluded in all the tour programs of
the Atlanta Symphony this season.

Mother Goose Suite Featured

Following the performance of the
Prelude, the Orchestra will play
Mother Goose Suite (Ma Mere L’Oye),
a piece written for the ballet in 1912 by
Maurice Ravel.

The concluding selection will be
“The Pageant of P.T. Barnum Suite for
Orchestra,” composed in 1924 by Doug-
las Moore. Mr. Moore received the
Pulitizer Prize for music in 1951 and
is considered one of America’s lead-
ing composers. The movements in the
“Pageant of P. T. Barnum” include
Boyhood at Bethel, General and Mrs.
Tom Thumb, Jenny Lind, and Circus
Parade.

Atlanta Group Founded in 1945

The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra is
in its fifteenth year, having been
founded in 1945 as the Atlanta Youth
Symphony. Its first conductor was the
talented Mr. Henry Sopkin. Prior to
joining the Atlanta Symphony Orches-
tra, Mr. Sopkin gained wide recog-
nition for his work with student or-
chestras and by many musical works
he has edited and arranged.

In Top 25 Orchestras

In the span of fifteen years the At-
lanta Symphony has grown to a mem-
bership of 80, and is ranked among
the 25 major orchestras of America.
The orchestra extends its activities to
the concert centers of seven South-
eastern states.

Admission to the concert is by sea-
son ticket, or by paying $1.25 for a
ticket.

The next program presented by the
Concert Guild will be on Dec. 6, when
Michael Block, pianist, plays in Lee
Chapel.

Glee Club Sings

The Washington and Lee Glee Club
will sing Handel’s Messiah along with
other choral groups and The Roanoke
Symphony Orchestra Sunday, Dec.
4, at 4:00. The concert will be at the
American Theatre in Roanoke.

This concert is an annual one, and
it is a great honor for the glee club to
be asked to participate. Washington
and Lee’s will be the only college
singing group; the others will be local
choirs and choral groups for the most
part.

The Roanoke Symphony Orchestra,
conducted by Gibson Morrissey, is
well-known throughout the state and
considered by many to be the finest
orchestra in Virginia.

Friday Edition

 

Retrograde

Withdrawing from our usual sallies of “gadfly’’ intent, of
crying for reform and lauding progress, we question the moti-
vations under which this University is moving toward excel-
lence.

Although old areas of nebulous interpretation are being re-
defined, which appears a necessary contribution to progress,
more and more there is denial of student integrity in situations
of University life.

We would cite three “progressive” movements which, in an
effort to better provide for the student body as a whole, are, in
essence, denying the individual necessary consideration.

Those students and faculty which comprise the Student
Library Committee visualize a goal of dramatic reduction in
“unauthorized removal” and other violations. Consequently,
they have raised the maximum fine, tightened the restrictions
and increased their threat.

The Dance Board wishes to provide the University with
adequate dance sets, but recognizes that financial prerequisites
must be met. Their effort, consequently, is severe and de-
manding. There can be no transfer of dance plans at the risk
of jeopardizing the necessary financial status. To assure this,
once again restrictions are tightened, and the Honor System,
unjustly, serves as the deterrant looming over the student’s
head.

Another illustration of this tendency can be found in the
athletic department. Formerly, a student who participated in
Intramural athletics had to meet medical requirements by
signing a pledge guaranteeing the specific amount of practices.
Once again, failure to properly follow policy equals punish-
ment. The motivation, however, is deeper than the threat, and
more than likely, a new policy to guarantee compliance will be
formulated by the athletic department and the intramural
board policy which will be worded under the concept of “do
this or else...”

And again, the main problems confronting the IFC in
their “Hell Week dilemma” are those of enforcement and
punishment with regards to the restrictions they levy. Paradox-
ically, they are seeking to strengthen the position of the indi-
vidual.

The Honor System has a purpose, and it does not deny
an individual integrity. It maintains standards of honor, but an
individual is not forced to be honorable at Washington and Lee.
That is probably one of the reasons the system has endured
here for a century. The Honor System, as well as the other
traditions, do not, as many think, pose a threat, they foster an
ideal. This ideal reinforces an individual’s integrity.

We call for a re-examination in those progressive areas
whose means are thwarted with this “force” concept. If this is
not successful, we would sanction student protest on the grounds
as we have stated them.

If we can achieve our goals by srengthing the integrity of
our members, rather than sacrificing it, Washington and Lee
will truly be doing its part as a liberal arts institution.

Slow Down And Live

The Friday Staff of the Ring-tum Phi asks all students who
are going to the Hollins Cotillion tonight and tomorrow night
to slow down—and live.

As the university proctor pointed out today, at least two or
three accidents occur between W&L and Hollins during this
weekend every year.

We realize that it is a temptation to travel a little faster
than the speed limit, but we urge all students traveling the roads
to observe safe driving habits, especially during this weekend.

We would ask that all students remember this: “Slow

   

 

down—the life you save, may be your own.”

Characters In Troubadour Play
Are All Given Excellent Rating

By BOND JOHNSON
Friday Reviewer

Pride, you know, is one of the seven
deadly sins. Or so we were told last
night at the production of Christo-
pher Fry’s “The Lady’s not for Burn-
ing.” Let’s hope it’s not too deadly,
because the Troubs are going to have
a hard time avoiding it after tossing
about Fry’s sensibly nonsensical lines
so delightfully last night.

Peopled by such characters as a
mother who tells us she is sure the
end of the world will come in the fall
instead of in April because God would
never disappoint the bulbs, and a drunk
who in his thanatopsis tells us how
tiring this everlasting life is, the play
clips along at a healthy pace.

Setting in 15th Century

In a setting that is “more or less
exactly” fifteenth century, the mori-
bund, the nonchalant, and the male-
volent have a lot to say that juxtaposes
quite fittingly into our own topsy-
turvy century. The cast says it all,
very skillfully.

Andy Leonard as the chaplain gave
a poignantly hilarious portrait that was
in ways the triumph of the evening.
Passionately in love with his mis-
treated violin, always appealingly lost,
he was the only character who in-
spired spontaneous applause on his
exit.

Performance By Allen Is Funny

Bob Allen, once he warmed up to
the audience’s laughs, gave a perform-
ance that was equally, if in a more
sophisticated way, funny. Never once
losing the character of the mayor, he
delivered some of the best lines in the
play devastatingly. Mervyn Clay as
the judge formed an effective foil to
the mayor. His performance was ex-
cellently sustained.

Yvonne Dickens, practical and solid
as the mother, Ron Alenstein and
Firth Spiegel, moon-eyed and virile

 

as her sons, were all attractive in their

roles. Liza Tracy and Dick Roberts
were the beguilingly simple-minded
young love birds.

Dunnell Portrays Mendip

John Dunnell brought to the role
of Thomas Mendip the same resound-
ing voice and calculated grace that
made him such a success in “Taming
of the Shrew.” Margaret Davis, as the
lady not for burning, was charming.
Her voice her movements, her insight
into the role are those of a profes-
sional.

Tim Morton, as the ruddy-nosed and
omni-beneficient drunk who appeared
near the end, was good enough to

 

The Leaf-raker’s Concert

Snubbed By Students

By THORNS CRAVEN
Friday Columnist

Last Friday I made my initial appear-
ance on this page, and since you've
all laughed loud and long I’m going

to do it again.
Since I’ve already
been here once
there’s no need to
re-introduce my-
self, and I can
launch immediately
into my humorous
bit.

From the head-
line you’ve probab-
ably surmised
(since you're so
smart) that this is
a critical review (in the Jimmy Vann,
or James Vann vein) of the annual
Leaf-Raker’s Concert. I’m sorry that
it’s a week late, but since the Friday
Edition is only published on Friday
(except leap years when it comes out
on Friday), this tardiness must, in all
fairness to me, be overlooked.

And since you're overlooking me,
I'll overlook Mr. Vann as is the cam-
pus custom. But I will not overlook
him until I have criticized his lack
of depth reporting in his column of

he

Craven

 

last week. While his words were well-

chosen concerning the Sullins-W&L
concert he completely omitted any
mention of the concert presented on
the preceding evening by the Amal-
gamated Leaf-rakers and Campus
Cleaners Union, Local No. 709 1/4,
Branch 47-J of the International
Teamsters Union, under the leader-
ship and paternal protection of our
father and protector, Jimmy Hoffa;
James C. Petrillo conducting.

If Mr. Vann is going to chastise the
student body and faculty for missing
Te Deum then he should at least men-
tion the inspiring, if off-key, rendition
of “Autumn Leaves” offered by the
Leaf-raker A Cappela choir. Naturally
this was the high spot of the evening,
since it is the group’s theme song,
naturally.

The rest of the program consisted
of raking over the coals of other old
standards. Things like “September
Song,” “Gone With the Wind,” and a
reworking of the old favorite “I'll Be
With You in Leaf-Raking Time,” done
to the tune of the Star Spangled Ban-
ner.

Needless to say, those of you who
missed the program (held at Liberty

U.S. Hopes For Sign Of

In Results Of Japanese

By ROBERT C. KETCHAM
Friday Columnist

With the campaign over several
esoteric comments can be made on
another election to
be held this month,
Japan’s general
election on Nov.
20. The Liberal-
Democratic Prime
Minister Hayeto
Ikeda is expected
to win this elec-
tion running on
what was original-
ly billed as the
“Security treaty”
platform.

This election seems to be turning
more on economic policy than on de-
fense policy; therefore, a victory of
Ikeda’s party does not necessarily mean
that Japan’s votes unqualifiedly support
the treaty. There are 467 seats in the
Diet; the Liberal-Democrats are put-
ting up 396 candidates, while the So-
cialists are running 186. The Socialists,

   

Ketcham

 

who prefer neutralism, cannot hope
to win a majority, but they can claim
a moral victory if their vote increases
by about 30 per cent.

The United States emphasis on de-
fense is largely traceable to the Ko-
rean War. That conflict encouraged
us to build up our policy of con-
tainment by a chain of interlocking
global bases, military alliances and
regional military forces. Japan, Oki-
nawa and the Philippines were utilized
as forward bases from which to plan
defense. It is demonstrable that this
policy has deterred Communism.
However, our defensive policy has also
bred fears and phobias which reduce
the certainty of its future value.

People Think of Security

Most peoples are prone to think in
terms of their own security. When a
local base is looked upon by the popu-
lation as capable of drawing unde-
sirable elements and also appears in-
defensible, it is no longer wanted. The
United States must recognize that its
base must be capable of doing more

 

than protecting our own security. Our
own vested interests extend into the
concepts of friendships and allegiance
of that country in which the base is lo-
cated.

There have been several unfortunate
incidents which have lowered our
respect and appreciation in Japan: the
U-2 incident and its profitable propa-
ganda exploitation, Kishi’s unpopu-
larity with his people, some base in-
cidents which involved citizenry and
the Okinawa American administra-
tion which, many Japanese feel, vio-
lates “residual sovereignty.”

Friction Somewhat Abated

On the other hand, the friction has
been abated somewhat with the dis-
appearance of most of American
ground forces in Japan. The afore-
mentioned incidents are unlikely to
reoccur, but they have seeded doubts
not easily overcome.

Economically Japan is much improv-
ed, largely because of the close eco-
nomic ties with the U.S. Last year
the Japanese rate of growth was an;

 

Victory
Election

unbelievable 16 per cent. The Japanese
people associate this record with the
Liberal-Democrats, and by implica-
tion with the U.S.

If we can maintain our reciprocal
trade, giving them a market for their
products, we can do much to prevent
Peking’s successful wooing of Japan.

Relations Would Be Natural

Establishment of the trade relations
between Japan and Peking would be
a natural, were one party not Com-
munist, because of the Sino-Japanese
similarities of culture and thought,
not to mention geographical proximity.
Even with the Communist threat
many Japanese industrialists wish to
resume trade with this block and,
at the same time be impliedly com-
mitted to staying in our shadow. To
minimize this trade possibility we must
maintain a positive presentation of
capitalism wth freedom, plus the op-
portunities for trade.

With Japan coming of age to think
for herself it is almost too much to

Direction and Costumes Good

The vaulted sets were better than
the sets for Fry’s translation of
Girandoux’s “Duel of Angles” pro-
duced in Washington. The direction
was gracefully effortless and yet care-
fully controlled. The costumes were,
as the sets, very nicely done.

Unfortunately, due to the poor fa-
cilities of the Troub Theatre, there
was some trouble with sound effects.
Once, before a cock’s crow, there was
a noise that sounded suspiciously like
surface static on our record player.

Need New Curtain Apparatus

Oh yes, one last thing. It seems that
the Troubadours with their splendid
sets and performances, have shown
themselves worthy to be given a new
curtain pulling apparatus. This one
behaved embarrassingly during the
last two acts and the curtain call.

Honor System

Should Not Be
Over-Extended

By MALCOLM BROWNLEE
Friday Columnist

My honor is like a small rubber band.
It can be stretched, s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d,
s-t-r-e-t—ched! Whoops! Too far.
Can you not see it is only a small rub-
ber band? You must consider its limi-
tations.

Within its limits my honor is very
strong, very strong indeed for its size.
Gentlemen always
have strong hon-
or—for them, it is
a cardinal virtue—
and I, of course,
am a_ gentleman.
But everything has
its limits, and my
honor is no excep-
tion.

It is strongest, in
i s fact, when it is not

stretched at all,
_— somewhat flabby
then perhaps but in its most comort-
able state. How I wish it could always
be in that comfortable state; but it
cannot be, for people do not recog-
nize my honor’s limitations.

   

Recognize It’s Limitations

Why can they not recognize its limi-
tations? Why must they stretch the
rubber band until it breaks? Can
they not see that an unstretched, un-
broken band is better than a band
that is stretched and broken? They
are trying to destroy my honor. They
are trying to snap it in pieces.

These Dance Board people, for in-
stance, what right have they to stretch
my honor? What is there dishonor-
able about telling a white lie about
my name? Is there dishonor in avoid-
ing a few dollars’ fee? One would
think I was a kid sneaking into a
circus. My honor cannot be concerned
with such petty things.

Generals Launch Final 1960 Campaign Saturday,
Seek 8th Win, First Undefeated Season Since 1914

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Sports Editor
One more game.
One more win.

An undefeated season!

With a win over Washington Univer-
sity of St. Louis tomorrow, Coach Lee
McLaughlin and his Five-Star Gen-
erals will step into the Washington
and Lee football hall of fame.

With a win, the Generals will post

the second undefeated season in the
school’s history.

Already McLaughlin and his Gen-
erals have crushed enemy after enemy
in piling up the best football record
since 1915.

Already McLaughlin and his Gen-
erals have proved that a non-subsi-
dized football team can win just
as often as the subsidized teams.

Generals have been so successful this
season.

The depth helped in the early games,
but it really began to pay off when a
wave of injuries struck the team about
mid-October. As General after Gen-
eral was injured, there was always
another General waiting to take his
place.

W&L Booters Plan Surprise, 4-3-3 Attack,
For Lynchburg In Virginia Tournament Today

This afternoon marked the opening
of the second annual Virginia State
Soccer Tournament which is being
held this year at Lynchburg.

The opening round began earlier
this afternoon as the University of
Virginia met VPI in a contest at 1:00.

The afternoon’s second match at
3:00 featured the W&L Generals
against the Hornets of Lynchburg
College.

The tournament finale will take place
tomorrow night at Lynchburg’s base-
ball stadium with the two losers of
today’s games playing at 6:30. To-
day’s winners will play the champion-
ship playoff at 8:30.

In last year’s tourney held at W&L,
the Generals placed second to Lynch-
burg in a contest that saw the Blue
and White play three games in the
last day, only to drop the nightcap,
4-3.

This year Coach Joe Lyles hopes
to pull the upset of the year, and

at the same time avenge a rather
long standing grudge that exists
between W&L and the Hornets.

It is a sad, but sorry fact, that a
W&L soccer team has never managed
to win a single contest from Lynch-
burg in the five years that Lynch-
burg has played soccer.

Although Lynchburg trampled the
Generals earlier this season, 7-1, Lyles
figures that his new offensive attack
pattern may prove to be the margin
of victory against the rather com-
placent Hornets.

This attack involves an entirely new
offensive line that forms in a 4-3-3 pat-
tern rather than the accustomed 5-3-2.
While this may not impress too many

Skipper Smith, then the bug hit ends
Ned Hobbs and Landon Butler.

Now fullback Doug Martin and half-
back Charlie Gummey, the two race
horses who galloped for 246 yards
against Sewanee last week, are on
the injured list. Both are doubtful
starters for tomorrow’s game.

But as usual McLaughlin has sev-
eral seasoned football players stand-
ing in line to take over Martin’s and
Gummey’s positions.

Ready to go at fullback are sopho-
more Tommy Keesee and senior Joe
Hess.

McLaughlin has no worries about
Keesee—he’s the boy who chugged
64 yards in the mud to give the
Generals a 6-0 win over Carnegie
Tech.

Ready at Gummey’s left half slot are
juniors Jim Hickey, who has been
showing flashes of greatness after an
early season injury, and Dave Tharp.

The Bears of Washington U. have
only a 2-6 record to place against
W&L’s 7-0-1 mark, but they play
a tougher schedule, according to Mc-
Laughlin.

“We know from experience that
Washington will be a cut above the
level of opposition we usually en-
counter on Saturday,” McLaughlin
said. “They play very strong teams
and they have looked well on oc-
casion despite their six losses.”

The Bears seemed to have had
trouble putting two good halves to-
gether since they beat Missouri
Mines, 34-12, and Wabash, 10-8,
early in the season.

Scout Buck Leslie reported that last
week the Bears had little trouble mov-
ing the ball against Butler in the first
half, but bogged down in the second
half.

Washington utilizes straight power
and effective trap plays off their wing-
T formation. Halfbacks Al Huenfeld
and Terry MacKey supply the Bears’
running power.

Last year the Generals staged a come-
from-behind 35-26 victory over the
Bears to climax a 3-4-1 season.

Fighting to keep the team from
taking a complacent attitude, Mc-
Laughlin said, “I'm hoping that the
boys will recall how the Bears push-
ed us around for better than three
quarters last year before making
mistakes that cost them the game.”

(Continued on page 4)

 

“With one freshman, nine sopho-
mores, three juniors, and a_ senior,
this year’s squad certainly will be
young,” basketball coach Bob Mc-
Henry said.

“This team will make mistakes, but
with an emphasis on defense and team
effort, it will give its opponents real
trouble.”

After several weeks of practice the
starting five consists of John Kirk
and Bret Thackston, guards; Dave
Grogen and Roger Fauber, forwards;
and John McDowell, center.

McDowell is a 6-5 freshman whom
McHenry considers to be a prime
basketball prospect.

Pushing hard for a starting berth is
returning letterman, Ken Kowalski, a
clever playmaker.

The W&L basketball team will
start its 18-game schedule at Bridge-

Last year’s cage squad compiled a
7-10 record. It lost twice to Bridge-

play Norfolk Division of William and

McHenry tested his squad against

pleased with its showing.

Varsity Billiard Academy Caters
To Students, But Faces Problems

By TOM JORDAN
Copy Editor

“Rack, Teddy!”

A dark-haired, young man jumps
up from the stool he is sitting on,
puts down his Police Gazette, and hur-
ries to rack the billiard balls for some
impatient pool players.

This is a familiar scene at the Var-
sity Billiard pool room. Ted Macheras,
the friendly proprietor, runs the pool
room exclusively for W&L and VMI
students. He bought it in January of
1960 and, unfortunately, thinks that he
will have to sell it before June.

“Business is good for seven months
of the year, when the students are
here, but for five months there’s no
business,” says Teddy. “I'll either
sell the pool room or open up another
business here.”

Students Will Miss Pool Room

Several students will miss the pool
room if Ted should sell. VMI cadets
would miss it too, for they usually
take over when they are let out. There
are, percentage wise, very few W&L
students who play pool, but the ones
who play do so frequently, and, in
general, make up for the deficiency in
number.

“Exam time is the most active,” Ted
says, “because many students like to
play for a break in studying.” Of
course, party weekends are usually
slow for Ted.

Teddy has been in business in Lex-
ington for almost 20 years, most of
the time in the beer business. The
pool hall was a new venture for him
when he bought it from Pete at the
College Inn.

Pool Room Is Clean

The most impressive feature of the
pool room is its clean appearance.
Pool rooms are usually thought of
as dark, dirty joints where hoods
hang out all the time. It is just the
opposite here. Ted’s pool room is clean
and well-lighted, and one is always in
the company of students. Music is
usually heard over the radio, and the

two pin-ball machines in the rear are
generally in use, and the four pool
tables are clean and in good condi-
tion. To be sure one occasionally has
trouble breathing when the air be-
comes saturated with smoke, but the
large fan suspended from the ceiling
usually relieves the situation. The
room has a semi-modern appearance
with large windows, a few comfortable
chairs, and fluorescent lighting. A
magazine stand with such literature as
Post, Look, Life and, Teddy’s fav-
orite, Police Gazette provide enter-
tainment if one is waiting for some-
one else to play a game with.

Caters to Students

Teddy caters to students by giving
them a clean, attractive place to spend
those extra hours. His prices are
reasonable and he occasionally is host
to a bottle of coke.

It is surprising that more students
don’t play pool. “About 90 per cent
of those who play never touched a
cue before coming here,” according to
Ted. Pool, although it may have a bad
connotation as far as some people are
concerned, is a difficult game to play
and requires a great deal of skill, after
one gets out of the eight-ball rotation
stage. There’s a lot more to the game
than hitting a billiard ball into a
pocket, as a few have found out.

If Teddy should close the Varsity
Billiard, several students will miss
him, and, I’m sure, hope that Teddy
doesn’t sell.
