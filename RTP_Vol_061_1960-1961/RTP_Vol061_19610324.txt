In VMI Fieldhouse

 

Miss Virginia, Huff
At Spring Sport Show

The Lexington-Rockbridge Junior
Chamber of Commerce will sponsor
its first annual Valley Youth Fit-
ness and Sports Show at the VMI
fieldhouse on April 7-8. At a busi-
ness meeting Wednesday night, Mr.
Hugh Slusser, President of the Jay-
cees, stated that this would be “the
biggest show of its type ever to
take place in the Shenandoah Val-
ley, possibly in the state.”

The purpose of the show is to
promote athletic interest and physi-
cal fitness in people of all ages. The
grand scale on which this spectacu-
lar was originally planned is being
realized becaused of the concentrated
efforts of the Jaycees. The program
of events is long and varied; it
contains “something for everyone”
and includes many topics of direct
interest to Washington and Lee stu-
dents.

Ray Robrecht, intermediate law
student and 1959 Golden Gloves
Champion, will box Saturday night.
At the present, Ray has a 9-0 rec-
ord is is trying for his tenth win
tonight.

“Twenty girls in leotards,” to use
Jaycee Don Huffman’s phrase, will
perform a modern dance and ballet.
The dance group is from Sweet
Briar. There will be a fashion show
featuring sports and casual wear,

 

 

Miss Virginia, 1961

which will be modeled by local
beauties and members of the Vogue
Club from neighboring Southern
Seminary.

Assisting in the fashion show will
be Miss Virginia of 1961, Miss Cathy
Birch of Staunton, Va. She will
also give a twenty minute skit on
some item of sports interest. It has
been said that she will appear in
a baseball uniform.

W&L men will be featured in
other events. Hunter Tracht, a Beta,
and Spence McEvoy, a Phi Delt,
will give exhibitions on the trampo-
line. Two members of the Washing-
ton and Lee wrestling team will
demonstrate various wrestling holds.

Sam Huff, rugged all-American

 

and all all-Pro lineman of the New
York Giants will also appear at |

the Jaycee spectacular. He will be| |

present on both days to sign auto-
graphs and to assist in the drawings |
for the many door prizes which are |
to be given away. |

Further highlights of this many-
faceted show will include the ap-
pearance of Roger Webb and his
gymnastic team from U.Va.; an ex-
hibition by Curtis Weaver, expert
fly caster; a demonstration on the
fundamentals of skiing by Sepp
Kober; and discussions and demon-

Agelasto To Head UCA

By C. C. FLIPPEN
Staff Reporter

The University Christian Associa-
tion officers for the coming year were
elected in a regular meeting of the
UCA last night.

A Phi Psi junior from London
Bridge, Va., was elected to head
the UCA. He is Peter Agelasto who
held the office of chairman of com-
munity service in the UCA. Agelasto
replaces Malcolm Brownlee, a sen-
ior from Rockbridge Baths, Va.

Chosen to serve with the new
president were Arnold B. McKay,
a Phi Kap sophomore from Sand-
ston, Va. vice-president; and C.
Mark Whitehead, KA junior from
LaGrange, Ga., secretary. Keith A.
Carr, Beta sophomore from Chevy
Chase, Md., was re-elected treasur-
er of the group. McKay had pre-
viously served as chairman of wor-
ship. Ashley Wiltshire, a Delt soph-
omore from Richmond, Va., is the
outgoing secretary.

The newly elected officers will
serve throughout the entire 1961-62
session.

 

and Lee April 6 on “Geology and
World Affairs.”

The talk is scheduled for 8:15 p.m.
in duPont Auditorium. The pub-
lic is invited.

Dr. Patton will visit the campus
April 5-7 under the auspices of the
1961 Visiting Geological Scientists
Program of the American Geological
Institute. The program is being
sponsored “to improve the under-
standing of the geological sciences
on the campus and in the commun-
ity of the host institution.” The visit
chairman at Washington and Lee
is Dr. Edgar W. Spencer, head of
the department of geology.

Dr. Patton holds A.B., M.A., and
Ph.D. degrees from Indiana Univer-
sity. He is a member of the Associa-
tion of American State Geologists
and the Geological Society of Amer-
ica.

Two outstanding geologists have
appeared here in recent years under
similar programs. Dr. T. S. Lovering,
of the U.S. Geological Survey and
Mr. Raymond Moore of the Uni-
versity of Kansas both have visited
the campus.

“The American Geological Insti-
tute is a federation of scientific and
technical societies operating under
the National Academy of Sciences
to advance the science of geology
and to serve the needs of geological
scientists,” AGI officials say.

SW MSFC Sells
Nearly All Seats
For April Show

Seventy-five per cent of the tickets
for Heads or Tails, the 1961
SWMSFC musical production, have
been sold, SWMSFC officials said
today.

The weekend of April 14-15 is
completely sold out, and the sales
of tickets for week-night per-
formances have hit 60 per cent.

The musical’s writer-director,
Steve Danzansky, says he believes
the show will show a profit, especial-
ly since the show is being presented
at Hollins and possibly at Randolph-
Macon. The profits from the show
will go to the Student War Memor-
ial Scholarship Fund.

After Spring vacation the price
of tickets will be raised to $2.50.

Enlightened Version

Heads or Tails is Danzansky’s en-
lightened version of Anstophanes
original play Lysistrata which was
written about 400 B.C. The revised
version, though retaining the same
theme as the original, that of the
women of Athens and Sparta going
on a chastity strike to prevent war
between the men of their two city-
states, is longer and more involved.
From the original half-hour play
Danzansky has created a lively two-
hour musical. Besides spooking sex,
the Danzansky show also brings to
mind, via the use of clever dialogue,
the ever-present North-South con-
flict—this one of course between
Athens and Sparta.

Good Rehearsals

Rehearsals are going well, the
director says, and the cast is very
enthusiastic about the show.

When asked his opinion of the
audience’s reaction to the numerous
cave scenes, a serious male member
of the cast replied, “Might as well
hit ’em where it hits home.”

Journalism School Begins
Series of Educational Films

“The Informer” a film directed by
John Ford, will be screened in the
Washington and Lee University
journalism lecture room at 7:30 p.m.
Monday, April 4.

The film is one of a series of
movies for students in the journal-
ism communications department’s
course on the motion picture med-
ium. The screening is open to the
public.

Other films to be offered during
the semester include “Window on
Canada” and “Filming of On the
Beach.” All films are instructional,
on the nature of the medium itself,

N TO PLAY AT SPRINGS

‘King of Swing’ Will Perform
For Formal Dance Friday Night

The signing of Benny Goodman
to play at the Spring Dance Set
on Friday night is now dependent
only on a phone call. It was stated
by his New York agents that there
was no reason why confirmation
should not come through late today,
according to Dance Board president
Jim Vann.

The concerts given by Benny
Goodman and his all-star Trio,
Quartet and Orchestra in Carnegie
Hall are renowned the world over.
It was Goodman who helped make
“swing” a household word in the
thirties.

Benny Goodman is one musician
who refuses to grow old. He has not
become a collector’s item, but has re-
mained as the greatest clarinetist in
the entertainment field. Because he
is the center of whatever band he
plays with, he demands and gets
technical perfection, and marks each
performance with the stamp of
“Goodman.”

Goodman’s great achievement was
that he freed jazz from the limita-
tions of a small, cliquish audience
and awakened an interest in this
very basic American art in a wide
public which had never been reached
by it before. This was proved by
the many spontaneous demonstra-
tions which followed his perform-

—sances in the thirties.

Dr. Allen Ragan

In Council Race

Dr. Allen E. Ragan, a W&L po-
litical science professor, has enter-
ed the race for election to the Lex-
ington Town Council.

Dr. Ragan, who teaches municipal
government among his courses, has
filed his entry for the elections which
will be held this June.

Six Seats Open

Dr. Ragan’s entry into the race
brings to five the number of men
who have filed their candidacy for
the six council seats. Of the  in-
cumbent councilmen, one has stated
he will not run in June, two have
said that they will run but have not
filed their candidacy, and two are
still uncommitted at this point.

A senior member of the Washing-
ton and Lee faculty, he has been
at W&L for 15 years.

A native of Kentucky, Dr. Ragan
came to Lexington from a teaching
position at Tuscalum College in
Greenville, Tenn.

Interested in Good Government

Dr. Ragan told the Ring-tum Phi
today that he wanted to enter the
race because “I’m interested in the
welfare and the good government
of Lexington.”

He said he had never been a mem-
ber of such a group, and that his
entry for the coming elections was
his first attempt at Lexington poli-
ties.

Dr. Ragan said that he filed his
application for election last Monday
with Harry Wright, the clerk of
Rockbridge County’s Circuit Court.

 

Four Juniors, Three Sophs
Invited To Join Fraternity
For Journalistic Excellence

Bob Diehl, president of the Wash-
ington and Lee Chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi announced today that nine
students have been asked to join
the nationcl-professional journalism
society.

Diehl, a SPE from Manheim, Pa.,
said that two seniors, four juniors,
and three sophomores have been
asked to join the fraternity.

He said that the following were
named to join: R. J. O’Brien from
Newport News and Robert Holley,
Jr., from Moorestown, N. J., both
seniors.

Juniors asked to join are Roy
Goodwin, a KA from Augusta, Ga.;
Michael P. Keating a PiKA from
Centreville, Md., Richard L. Kelley,
a Pi Phi from Towson, Md., and
Charles Via, a Kappa Sig from
Martinsville, Va.

The three sophomores are Bill
Bowen, a SAE from Brooklyn, N.

 

Y.; Clarence Renshaw, from Mt. Leb-

or illustrate notable periods and| anon, Pa., and Bob Holland, a

styles of films.

Lambda Chi from Richmond.

 

The now-famous Goodman ar-
rangements of popular tunes were
contrived with the aid of some of
the finest creative jazz talents avail-
able. The Goodman arrangements
of “Riding High,” “Always,” “St.
Louis Blues,” “Stompin’ at the Sa-
voy,” “Moonglow,” “One O’Clock

 

Jump,” and many others have estab-
lished for him an international fol-
lowing that has given the name of
Benny Goodman a unique place in
the world of jazz.

The Trio and Quartet which sky-
rocketed jazz to immortality—Harry
James, Lionel Hampton, Gene Kru-
pa, Teddy Wilson, Ziggy Elman, Jess
Stacy, Chris Griffin—has now divid-
ed into many segments. But the
stablizing influence which bound
these men all together—Benny
Goodman—has retained that same
greatness while adapting it to the
present decade’s tastes.

The appearance of Goodman at
the Friday night dance, which
has a “Shangri—La” theme, will
mark one of the most outstanding
highlights in the history of Wash-
ington and Lee social life. Bill
Outman, president of the Dance
Set, is centering the theme of the
dance around James Hilton’s famous
novel, Lost Horizon. The oriental
motif combined with the Goodman
jazz and idiom will set the 1961
Spring Dance apart as one of the
most unique ever held.

This year the schedule of the
Spring Dance Set has been changed
in an effort by Jim Vann to gain
more student interest in the dance
and concert. Last year Claude
Thornhill played for a Friday night
formal dance and Joni James gave
a concert on Saturday night sup-
ported by Thornhill’s band. The plan
this year is for a Saturday after-
noon concert given by an as yet un-
announced jazz group and Benny
Goodman’s performance Friday
night.

 

Unique Seminar Set

Dr. William R. Mueller, chairman
of the Department of English at
Goucher College, will be the speak-
er in Washington and Lee’s first
seminar in religion. The Seminar
which will be held on Tuesday and
Wednesday, April 4 and 5 will be
jointly sponsored by the English
and Religion Departments.

The theme of Dr. Mueller’s lec-
tures will be “Religion in Contem-
porary Literature.” During his visit
at Washington and Lee, he will de-

 

McPherson Will Lecture

Dr. Harry McPherson, General
Counsel for the Democratic Platform
Committee, will speak on “Regional-
ism and National Interest” Friday,
April 7 at 8:15 in duPont Auditor-
ium.

The announcement of Dr. Mc-
Pherson’s visit to the campus came
today from Dr. Marshall Fishwick,
professor of sociology at the uni-
versity.

On the Floor

The current activities of Dr. Mc-
Pherson keep him continuously on
the floor of the United States Senate,
and in frequent conferences with
Vice-President Lyndon Johnson and
the Democratic Majority Leader,

(Continued on page 4)

 

 

liver two evening addresses in du-
Pont auditorium. The topics for the
addresses will be “Literature of
Biblical Commitment” and Litera-
ture of Ultimate Concern.” Also Dr.
Mueller will meet several religion
classes and hold a special seminar
for English majors.

Dr. Mueller is currently Chairman
of the Department of English at
Goucher College, Baltimore, Md. In
the field of English Literature he
holds the A.B. degree from Prince-
ton and the M.A. and Ph.D. from
Harvard. He holds the M.A. in the
field of Religion from Union Theo-
logical Seminary, N.Y. Before taking
his present post at Goucher, Profes-
sor Mueller taught at Williams
College and the Women’s College of
the University of North Carolina.

He is the author of two books,
The Anatomy of Robert Burton’s
England, and The Prophetic Voice in
Modern Fiction, and the editor of a
third, That Soueraine Light: Essays
in Honor of Edmund Spenser, 1552-
1952.

Professor Mueller’s special in-
terest in the religious insights in
modern “secular” literature is based
upon his conviction that “much of
our ostensibly religious writing is
hardly worth the time of a person
seeking religious insights or aesthetic

» Satisfaction.”

Seg

 

Dr. William R. Mueller of Goucher College will deliver a series of seminar
lectures on “Religion in Contemporary Literature” April 3 and 4, The
lectures will be sponsored by the English and Religion Departments.

Don’t Become A Statistic

The National Safety Council usually predicts the number
of persons that will lose their lives on our nation’s highways
during a given holiday period. Each Spring Vacation, they
estimate that between 300 and 350 people will lose their lives.

Publicized statistics and repeated appeals from the National

Safety Council have failed to

influence American motorists

to any great extent. The record of the fatalities and permanent-
ly maimed continue to soar out of proportion to the population
but quite in proportion to the almost suicidal “horsepower
race” that exists in the American automobile industry.

We only wish to bring into effect some serious thought
concerning the obligation that each of you holds in your hands
as you grip the wheel of a car while driving the big “20-hour
push, non-stop” to home, to the girl, or to the favorite vacation

spot.

Your judgment and discretion or the lack of same will have
far-reaching consequences of either uninterrupted happiness or
the setting for a grief-stricken tragedy. In either case, the net
result will affect you and your immediate family and also the
lives of many whom you have never considered.

Let’s hope no Washington and Lee student will be among
the toll figures for Spring 1961. Maybe Washington and Lee
will be lucky enough to have all of its students returning from

a happy holiday.

Incidentally, the idea that high speed will cut down on
travel time is pretty foolish. The only thing high speed will cut
down on is drivers and passengers.

The Friday Edition wishes each student a happy holiday,
and we hope that you will make it back safely to Lexington and
not to a hospital bed or funeral parlor.

The Executive Committee
Should Have Most Prestige

By MALCOLM BROWNLEE

Friday Columnist

I suppose it is impossible to hope
that the main weaknesses of our
student body elec-
tions will be cor-
rected anytime
soon. These cor-
rections would
mean the scrap-
ping of our pres-
ent political sys-
tem, which, of
course, no one
wants to scrap de-
spite its absurd-
ness.

But there is one
Change which I hope we can make.
This change would correct a con-
spicuous flaw in our voting system
and at the same time would let us
keep the party factions which are
so dear to us.

I refer to the fact that our dance-
set presidents are elected before our
class representatives to the Execu-
tive Committee. Thus some of those
who would serve most ably in our
student government are relegated to
positions of inferior importance.

It is true, of course, that the
dance-set presidents do a great deal

   

Brownlee

 

of work. But it is a type of work
that any good organization man can
do. It does not affect our campus

for more than one weekend, and] |

even then it does not greatly affect
it. Our dance sets are becoming less
and less popular, but our dance-set
presidents still hold four of the top
seven prestige positions on our cam-
pus.

Couple this with the obvious fact
that not all of the Executive Com-
mittee decisions are concerned with
cases that are either black or white.
The Honor System cannot be re-
duced to a set of rules which covers
every incident which might be in-
terpreted as a breach of honor. For
this reason the Executive Commit-
tee should be filled with men who
are capable of mature judgment.

I do not claim that the best of
such men are always chosen as
dance-set presidents, but often they
are. Our student governing body
should be considered the position of
most importance and of highest pres-
tige on our campus. That it is not is
an obvious weakness in our voting
system.

 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

March 17th
To the Editor:

It’s almost exciting to at last read
conservative views in a_ college
newspaper! Very infrequently I run
across a letter to the editor, or—
even more infrequently —a feature
article that voices any degree of con-
servative libertarian ideas. But these
few voices—which are usually quite
articulate, too—are worth the wait-
ing.

To be specific, I enjoyed immense-
ly reading the Ring-tum Phi’s edi-
torial, coverage, and features on
Senator Barry Goldwater's visit to
your campus a few weeks ago. And
although there were several qualifi-
cations and reservations in that cov-
erage concerning Goldwater and his
(and my) brand of conservatism, I
can’t tell you what a pleasure it was
to see them stated rationally, intel-
ligently, and constructively.

If it’s one thing I’m sick of, it’s
this typical-typical holier-than-thou
self-righteousness which stereotypes
the majority of college editors. Their

 

protests and their agreements con-
form—to the letter—to the moth-
eaten mold from which they are
pressed. These young men and wo-
men inherit, and thus fail to create,
most of their ideas, patterns of
thought, and phraseology.

To understand what I’m talking
about, pick up any college news-
paper and glance over the editorial
page. The same hackneyed phrases
and ideas are dragged out concern-
ing the standard political scapegoats:
HUAC, Peace Corps, sit-ins, etc.,
etc. Are there no other areas of po-
litical, social, and economic concern
here and abroad? Or are there even
any new ideas or even protests con-
cerning these raging issues?

Politics should be of interest
and concern to all students; so
concern to all students; so shouldn’t
this mean we form a philosophy that
is individual to us, and that incorpor-
ates many questions and often con-
flicting solutions? I just wish I
could discover an original editorial

THE RING-TUM PHI

RES IPSA LOQUITUR

 

By THORNS CRAVEN

Friday Columnist

Tomorrow is tomorrow is tomo-
rrow, and after that we'll leap in
our pretty pace from day to day.
This column writ-
ten for those of
us who are still
here on Friday,
but are just be-
ginning to attack
the pre-vacation
kegs in a rush of
anticipation. And
with the dawn
we'll all flee,
handovers includ-
ed, to the tropi-
eal clime of sun-
ny Florida—the ZBT’s answer to
Calfornia.

I had originally intended to make
this column a little guide book con-
cerning what-to-do while vacation-
ing in the sun. The thought got so
developed that I was even think-
ing of putting out a government
pamphlet entitled “1001 Ways To

   

Craven

Act As The

 

 

Have Fun in the Sun, and Looking
Cool All the While.” That would
sell, of course, for a quarter a copy;
obtainable from the Department of
the Intéffér, Washington 25,D.C. But
I got hung up at about number eight
hundred and forty-seven, or there-
abouts, and gave it up. And since
Warner Brothers has already shown
the way, and I’ve never been fur-
ther south than Jessup, Ga., I guess
it would have been neither original
nor authoritative. And, also, I’m go-
ing to New York, and my hand-
book wouldn’t have proved func-
tional there at all. So I guess every-
one will just have to have original
fun in the sun, and read the Col-
lege Town Shop ads on how to look
cool all the while.

But forsaking my project leaves
me without a column, and far be it
for me to let anyone go South for
ten days without carrying a few
laughs with them. Especially since
almost everyone is on a_ limited

 

budget.

So here are suggestions for get-
ting laughs before going to Florida,
and possibly for taking them all the
way.

First of all, leave right now. Call
up Dean Gilliam, tell him you can’t
wait a minute longer, and that the
whole university can go to ????. Re-
instatement only cost a couple of
dollars plus final absence probation,
and a good laugh is easily worth
that.

Now that you’ve servered your
connections with the university, and
have come back to pick up some
traveling tips, here they are: Since
you've probably already stocked
your car bar, and do doubt you’ve
learned how to operate a church
key (beer opener), I won’t go into
all that. I'll discuss, instead, sports
and games. Cow poker is good, but
like games of similar nature, is
limited. You have to know what a
cow is. Another good one is count-

 

pring Vacation Advice Given:
Ivy-Leaguers Would

ing up state license plates until
you’ve seen one from every state.
Close your eyes on the way out of
town so you won’t get too far ahead
too quickly on this one.

The best games, though, have two
purposes, these being a test of skill
and a useful function. A good be-
ginners game in this category is
throwing beer cans at signs. This
gets rid of trash while improving
marksmanship. A more advanced
version (for people with more skill
and more expensive trash) is throw-
ing whiskey bottles at pedestrians.
Devise your own scoring system.

Of course the best games come
when you hit Florida, as you all
have seen in the flicks. So as a
parting word I advise you all to say
that you’re an Ivy Leaguer, rape
some girl, and she be run down by
a capitalist as she wanders about
on the Florida Freeway in complete
disillusion after finding out you’re
really from W&L. Have fun gang.

Operation Abolition, a 45-minute
movie sponsored by the House Un-
American Activities Committee, has
now been seen by
approximately 10
million people ac-
cording to com-
mittee chairman
Francis Walter.

This film is an
edited short sold
by Washington
Viedo Produc-
tions, Ine. for $100
a print. The film
was. taken off
the demonstra-
tions and hearing while the commit-
tee met in the historic session of
May 12-14, 1960, in San Francisco.
The HUAC subpoenaed all the films
from two TV studios ostensibly for
its own files. However, the film was
delivered to the above mentioned
commercial studio for what the film
company has termed a “speculative
venture.”

Lewis Narrates

A young man with a familiar
name, Fulton Lewis, III, did the
narration of the film and travels
with it to college campuses where it
is to be shown. The sound track
makes the dispassionate observer a
participant as emotional words are
tossed to the viewers: “revolution,”

Two From W&L
Attend Session

Dean of the College William W.
Pusey, III, and American History
Professor A. W. Moger will attend
a nationwide “Conference on Out-
standing Students in Liberal Arts
Colleges.” The Conference will be
held at Buck Hill Falls, Pa., March
26-29.

The purpose of the conference is
to discuss ways and means of pro-
viding the best possible education for
college students who have outstand-
ing intellectual abilities. The confer-
ence is designed for independent
colleges with enrollments under
2,000. Fifty institutions have been
invited to attend.

The attempt to provide improved
facilities for able students in the in-
dependent-arts colleges is an out-
growth of a similar study and pro-
gram carried on in the universities.

 

The attendance of the Dean and
Mr. Moger at the conference is
considered a step in line with the
“New Era” at Washington and Lee.

 

ik

“hostilities,” “dupes,
“battleground,” “mob.”

Says the committee of the film:
(it) “exposes communism’s avowed
objective of destroying the Com-
mittee on Un-American Activities
and our Nation’s entire security pro-
gram.” Also strong in their endorse-
ment have been the FBI’s J. Edgar
Hoover, the National Review and
several conservative Baptist groups.

Many Doubts

Many queries and doubts as to
the truthfulness and thoroughness of
the film have been raised notwith-
standing. After making its own study
of events, the National Council of
Churches issued this statement to
its ministers: “not to exhibit the film
unless a full and fair presentation”
is made of all the facts.

The San Francisco police who
also endorse the film have none-
theless conceded that it occasionally
scrambles sequences and errs in one
or two places. Another endorser,
William Wheeler, the committee’s
own investigator, admitted of some
error in a taped television debate in
Los Angeles:

Student

Student: “I am basing my discus-
sion on the fact that the film does
have inaccuracies, does have distor-
tions.”

Wheeler: “All right, we have ad-
mitted that. Let’s get on to another
subject.”

Student: “You have admitted that,
Mr. Wheeler?”

Wheeler: “Certainly.”

In admitting of some factual er-
ror the committee chairman Walter
insisted that “it’s unfortunate, but
honest and decidedly minor.”

Set up in 1947, the HUAC came
into its own during the McCarthy
era. It has attempted to keep its
power and influence as great as it
was in that period. The committee
has apparently been successful, this
year’s vote to keep the committee
was 412-6 and the group got the
money requested with no strings
attached.

Speculative Venture

Operation Abolition has been
highly successful as a “speculative
venture.” Nor has it been less re-
warding for the Committee in that
prints of the film are booked months
in advance by Army camps, Ameri-
can Legion posts, political meetings.

When a corporation buys this film
it is guilty of nothing worse than
taking the stockholders money and
using time which could be more
profitably utilized in a coffee break.

When a print is purchased by a
Federal Agency it is wasting tax-
payers’ money for the improper pur-
pose of becoming an advertising
agency for the HUAC.

 

‘Operation Abolition’ Is A Film
Which Should Be Shown Here

1

Present at W&L

It would be worthwhile to have
this film shown on campus, however,
and I would like to propose that it
be done. The School of Journalism
which gives courses in both films
and propaganda should welcome the
opportunity to bring this officially
endorsed indictment to Lexington.

The menace of Communism as es-
poused by present day Marxists is
a national threat. But to give a com-
mittee the power and prestige which
it is enjoying at the present is equal-
ly dangerous. Dangerous because
the committee furthers its own ends
by blunt accusations and distortions
of the very thing this nation’s peo-
ple do fear.

Propaganda Stunt

To bring the film to campus would
give students a chance to evaluate
the film for what it is, a propaganda
stunt promoted by an agency of our
government. There is much more to
the film than is on its face; but to
be fairly judged the film and the
facts must be presented.

 

Examination Schedule
May 20, 1961 through May 30, 1961

It is the responsibility of each student to know the time and place of
meeting of each of his examinations. The hours for examinations are 9:00-
12:00 and 2:00-5:00. Any student more than five minutes late must present
a satisfactory reason for his lateness to be allowed to take the examination.

The ommission by a student of any regular examination causes him to for-
feit his place in the class and to receive grade F for the semester, unless he is
excused for reasons deemed sufficient by the Dean and the instructor concerned.

Maryland Rips
Generals, 22-4
In Lacrosse

Maryland’s Terrapins toyed with W&L’s lacrosse team
for fifteen minutes Thursday before lowering the boom and

racing to a 22-4 victory.

The Terps, one of the country’s*

top ten lacrosse teams, scored three
goals in the game’s first six min-
utes. Each score came with W&L
one man short. Then they let the
Generals nearly catch up.

Led by Ray Gordon and Ray
Miller, the Generals bounced back
to close the Maryland gap to 3-2
with 0:55 left in the first period.

Gordon tallied the first General
goal as he weaved around the right
side of the Maryland goal and fired
a low shot into the nets.

Miller followed Gordon’s goal two
minutes later with a 10-yard shot
from the left side.

Until two minutes before Gordon
scored his goal, Washington and
Lee had not had the ball in its
own territory. Maryland had com-
pletely controlled the play and had
muffed several scoring chances.

In the second period, the Ter-
rapins caught fire as they pounded
the Generals’ nets for six tallies.
Buddy Breadmore collected two
of those six after scoring two of
the Terp’s first period goals.
Breadmore added his final tally in
the third period.

Three times during the game,
Maryland caught the W&L defense
napping as they scored two goals
within ten seconds of each other.

Breadmore was in on the quick
goal scoring sprees twice. He teamed
with Fritz Waider to score goals
within a six second lapse in the
second period and paired up with
Jack Sadler in the third period for
two goals within eight seconds.

In the final period, John Kent
and Jim Herrill fired goals within
a ten second period.

Following Breadmore in the Mary-
land scoring were Waidner and Ray
Altman with three goals each; Walt

 

 

Durigg, Herril and Paul Johnson
with two goals each.
Gordon and Miller teamed up
again to score W&L’s third and

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team leaves early tomorrow morn-
ing on its annual spring training
tour. This year’s trip has the Gen-
erals playing six games in eight

and one of the best service teams in
the country, the Fort Gordon (Ga.)
Signalaires.

The Generals open the tour to-
morrow at Elon (N. C.) College. Last
year they lost to Elon 4-3 in ten
innings. Leading 2-1 in the home

Gonsoulin, a senior, was a dist-
ant second in the 400-yard free-
style. He swam a 4:47 while the
winner Dick Herr of William and
Mary turned in a 4:33. In the 200-
yard freestyle, Petersburg Y’s Stu
Bocynski edged Gonsoulin for
third, 2:13.5 to 2:21.4.

Coach Norris Eastman was very
pleased with Johnson and Gonsou-
lin’s showings.

“Next year I plan to take up a few
more boys and try to win the meet,”
Eastman said.

Coach Eastman has not received
the official team scores, but he said
that Washington and Lee did well
although it entered only two men.

This was the first year that Vir-
ginia has held an AAU swimming
meet. Eastman said this year’s meet
was very successful and that the
meet has potential of growing into a
top notch annual affair.

when a routine ground ball hit a
stone and bounded over the head of
second baseman Park Gilmore, en-
abling Elon to tie the score and
then go ahead 3-2. Although the
Generals tied the game in the ninth,
back to back triples in the tenth
gave Elon the win, and handed Roy
Carpenter the first of four one-run
defeats.

Phil Sharp was scheduled to
start Friday against Dartmouth,
so Carpenter can pitch Saturday’s
game, due both to his experience
and to a desire to avenge last
year’s setback.

 

After three games at Fort Gordon,
the Generals travel to Greenville,
N. C. to take on the Pirates of East
Carolina, a team coach Joe Lyles
considers to be one of the better
hitting ball clubs in the South. Last
year the Generals, with Carpenter
again on the mound, were shut out
7-0 by the Pirates despite some
stellar defensive play by centerfield-
er Robin Wood.

The Generals finish up the spring
trip this year against North Caro-
lina State, co-holder of last year’s
ACC title.

The trip is expected to provide

 

Golfers In Tournament

A pril 1-2 At Greenbrier

Washington and Lee University’s
golf team, headed by defending

‘medalist Jack Vardaman, will play
| host April 1-2 in the annual Green-

brier Collegiate Tournament at
White Sulphur Springs, W. Va.
Vardaman, a junior from Anniston,
Ala., finished two strokes ahead of
the field with a 149 in last year’s
tournament. He is also the defending
Virginia collegiate champion.

The two-day tournament on the
world-known Greenbrier fairways
is the early-season highlight of a
nine-match W&L schedule.

The Generals meet Massachusetts

Institute of Technology here April
5 in their opening dual match.

Other teams participating in the
Greenbrier Tournament are Colgate,
Virginia, Davidson, George Washing-
ton, West Virginia, Dennison, and
Ohio University. Ohio has won the
tournament for the past two years.

Washington and Lee will have
an inexperienced team this year
with only two lettermen, Varda-
man and Grantham Couch, return-

ing from last year’s club.

Joining Vardaman and Couch on
the W&L squad are sophomores

Last year the Generals had a
4-2-2 record and finished second in
the state tournament. But Coach
E. P. “Cy” Twombly thinks this
year’s team should better that mark
“because of better depth and bal-
ance.”

With a more experienced squad

Trackmen Seek Second Scalp
Against Wake Forest Today

After Washington and Lee

blasted High Point (N. C.)

College, 104-36, Coach Norm Lord did a strange thing.

 

He went into the dressing room®
and hung a piece of tape on the
blackboad. Over the tape he wrote—
“Scalp number one.”

Turning around Lord - said,
“That’s scalp number one. There’s
only seven more to go.” Last year
W&L had a 7-0 season. This year
could be undefeated season num-
ber two.

The Generals go after that prized
scalp number two today when they
tackle the Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence’s Wake Forest Deacons at
Winston-Salem.

The meet marks the first meeting
between Wake Forest, perennially
the worst track team in the Atlantic
Coast Conference, and Washington
and Lee.

Dr. McPherson Speaking
April 7 On ‘Regionalism’
(Continued from page 1)

Sen. Mike Mansfield of Montana.
Prior to becoming the Democratic
Counsel, Dr. McPherson was a pro-
fessor at the University of Texas.

He assumed his present duties
while Lyndon Johnson was a Sen-
ator from Texas and the majority
leader in the upper house. He was
active throughout the 1960 presiden-
tial campaign.

Interest in Regionalism

One of Dr. McPherson’s special
interests is regionalism, along with
the political scene. He has publish-
ed numerous articles and made many
speeches on the theme of regional-
ism. He has studied Southern rheto-
ric and is currently doing a history
of Southern oratory in the 19th and
20th Centuries.

While in Lexington, Dr. McPher-
son will appear in several classes
along with giving his public lecture
on Friday evening. The visit is being
sponsored by the American Studies
department.

the W&L campus. To mention only
a few: International Relations Week,
The Phi Beta Kappa assembly, ODK
selections, the SIPA convention, ten-
nis, lacrosse, baseball, intramural
events, and Spring and Final dances.
These and many other events are
covered by and preserved in the two

Realizing how hard it is for us,
here at school, to keep those at home

order that parents, friends, alumni
and any incoming freshmen may be
kept in closer contact with the
school.

We would encourage you to send
in your subscription as soon as pos-
sible in order that all the second
semester issues be sent. We will be
glad to include back issues as long
as they hold out. Everyone certainly
should spend 10 cents an issue to
keep his parents and others informed
on the school.

The attached form may be filled
out and mailed to Box 899, Lexing-

Light Play Next for Troubs

The Troubadour Theatre will con-
clude its season of modern European
plays with a comedy to be selected
from the works of Anton Chekov
or Bernard Shaw.

The works under consideration are
Chekov’s farce “The Marriage Pro-
posal” and Shaw’s series of comic
one-act plays based on Napoleon’s
life entitled “The Man of Destiny.”

These plays were chosen to rep-
resent the lighter side of European
drama, and to contrast with the
“heavy” Pirandello work, “Henry
IV,” which recently concluded a
highly successful run. ‘The Spring
production will be presented during
the first week in May. .

Troubadour director Dr. Cecil D.
Jones announced today that tryouts
for the spring play will be held in
duPont Hall on Tuesday, April 4,
from 7 to 10 p.m.,

AREYTON RING

Here’s one filter cigarette that’s really different!

The difference is this: Tareyton’s Dual Filter gives you a
unique inner filter of ACTIVATED CHARCOAL, definitely proved to
make the taste of a cigarette mild and smooth. It works together with
a pure white outer filter—to balance the flavor elements in the smoke.

Tareyton delivers—and you enjoy—the best taste of the best tobaccos.
