WAL Has First Vasstoatee Season In 46 Years

 

Coaches Corner

 

Coach Mac Praises Effort; | ¢
Thanks Everyone Involved

We were happy and we didn’t care
who knew it. As players, coaches and

well-wishers, we were all a bunch of
kids.

After each game this year as win
followed win, there was cause for jubi-
lation. However, there was always the
sobering thought that next week our
opponent was plotting to break our
string. Now we had 8 wins, no losses,
one tie and an undefeated season. No
one could take it away from us. Like
I said... We were happy.

The victory over Washington
University was not easy. Their line
was big and strong. The Bears had
a strong ground game and _ they
moved the ball nearly every time
they gained possession.

Our “blue” team found the going
very heavy and was not able to score
all afternoon. However, they contained
the Bears and helped set up the “red”
team’s scores. The “red” unit was very
sharp. Robin Wood moved his team
well, scoring one touchdown himself
and passing to Wallace Tiffany for an-
other. It was Joe Hess who got the
“first olive out of the bottle” on his

59 yard run. Joe also played a fine
defensive game. It was his spectacular
“clothesline” tackle that shook the ball
loose from the Washington quarter-
back and led to our final touchdown.

The Washington players and coaches
were high in their praise of “that 55.”
“We have not seen a better linebacker,”
was one comment.

While individuals must be men-
toned, touchdowns and victories be-
long to the team and the glory should
be shared by all members of the
squad.

It has been such a pleasure to coach |
th. s wonder ful crowd of boys this year

that I want to take this means a)
thanking you, the players. Your hard
work during the off season as well as
during the fall has pleased me tre-
mendously. The devotion of the squad
members for one another is no little
factor in your success. When our
admissions office selected you to be
; admitted to Washington and Lee, we
were insured of having intelligent
boys who could understand and carry
out our offense and defense. Use that
intelligence to keep your academic
: work up to the level you have main-
| tained during football season.

| In any success of the nature of our
football program here at Washington
and Lee, one attempts to supply a sim-
ple cause. To do this is a mistake.
There have been many factors contrib-
uting to the rise of football here. I
have only mentioned a few.

 

The general enthusiasm and co-
operation of the faculty, the admin-
istration, the student body, the stu-
dent press, and the alumni have been
wonderful and heartwarming.

One other factor that I want to
mention is the astuteness, faith, and
hard work of my assistants, Boyd Wil-
liams, Buck Leslie and also Charlie
Harrington who could not be around
to enjoy the fruits of his labors.

To all of you I want to say...

Thank You and God Bless You.

Plane Trouble

 

 

‘Slows Generals

Over half of W&L’s football squad
| took the field against Washington U.
Saturday afternoon, completely worn-
, out after a long delay caused when

» | the cabin door of a chartered Piedmont
> | airliner literally fell off.

It happened like this.
En route to St. Louis for the game,
both chartered DC-3’s pulled in at

| Evansville, Indiana for a refueling

job.

Minutes before take-off, the door
on one of the planes lost it’s thick
cast-iron hinges, causing the door
to dangle outside the plane.

After an hour’s delay, mechanics
at the airfield declared the DC-3 un-
safe for flight, and grounded it, along
with nearly half of the Washington
and Lee team.

There was nothing to do except
‘radio the pilot of the lead plane and
, have him return to Evansville—a flight
‘of an hour and 15 minutes—after he
| had taken the other half of the squad
| into St. Louis.
| In all, the incident caused a delay
of over three hours.

Hobbs, Suttle, Dick, Elected
To Captain 1961 Football Squad
In Post-Game Locker Room Vote

Steve Suttle, Ned Hobs, and Barton
Dick, have been elected tri-captains
for W&L’s 1961 football squad. They
were elected to their new posts by
their teammates immediately after
W&L’s 28-0 victory over Washington
University last Saturday in St. Louis,
Missouri.

Head football coach Lee McLaugh-
lin made the following comment on
the annual locker-room election’s re-
sults: “I am very pleased with the:
team’s choice for next year’s captains,
and I feel certain that they have made
a wise decision. I am sure that these
three boys will furnish the excellent
leadership that is necessary to lead
W&L to another undefeated season.”
Coach McLaughlin also mentioned the
fact that the three boys represent the
different sections of the team, Suttle
with the backs, Hobbs with the ends,
and Dick with the interior linemen.
According to the coach, all three boys
are equally good on both offense and
defense, and all three will probably
be on next year’s Blue team.

Steve Suttle

Steve Suttle, a junior from Uvalde,
Texas, led the team at the quarter-
back slot this year. In his three years
at W&L, he has been very active in
athletics, lettering in football for two
years, as well as in freshman track
and JV lacrosse his sophomore year.
Last year Steve won the “Roughest
Player Award” of the W&L football
team. Suttle is also a member of the
Varsity Club. Steve takes an active
interest in the academic side of W&L

 

also. since he has posted a 2.25 overall
average for four and a half semesters.
In addition to this, Steve is the Sec-
retary of the Junior Class, is president
of Delta Tau Delta, and a member of
the Student Vestry of the R. E. Lee
Memorial Episcopal church.

Ned Hobbs

Ned Hobbs, a junior from New
Canaan, Con., bolstered the W&L line-
up this year at right end. Besides let-
tering in football for two years, Ned
has lettered in baseball for W&L for
two years, is the captain of the 1961
squad, and is also a member of the
Varsity Club. Hobbs made the Dean’s|
List his sophomore year and is a
member of the Assimilation Commit-
tee. He was president of his Delt
pledge class in 1958 and is a member
of the Student Vestry of the R. E. Lee
Memorial Episcopal Church.

Barton Dick

Barton Dick, a junior from Morris-
town, Tenn., helped the team on of-
fense and defense from his left guard
position. In his sophomore year Dick
received the Moomaw Blocking Award
for his hard, consistent blocking. He
is a pre-medical student and is a mem-
ber of Alpha Epsilon Delta, the pre-
medical honor fraternity. He made the
Dean’s List his freshman year and is
Assistant Treasurer of the Delts.

These three, Steve Suttle, Ned
Hobbs, and Barton Dick will succeed
this year’s tri-captains, who led the
Generals to an undefeated season:
Courtney Mauzy, SAE; Terry Fohs,
Delt; and Bob Funkhouser, KA.

 

Williams, Leslie Instrumental In Wins

 

Coaches Williams and Leslie take in practice knocks.

Editor’s note: We hear a lot about |
unsung heroes these days. Our |
choice goes to Coaches Boyd Wil-
liams and Buck Leslie who are in
no small part responsible for Wash-
ington and Lee’s football success this
year.

This season was the seventh for |
Boyd H. Williams at Washington and |
Lee. In 1954 he coached the jayvee |
team which played a four-game sche-
dule after the varsity team had been
disbanded because of a player short- |
age. He came to W&L when football
fortunes were at a low ebb and has
been an integral part of the now suc- |
cessful non-subsidized progrram. Al- ;
though Williams devotes much time |
and thought to football, coaching is!
only a part-time interest. He main-
tains a prosperous insurance business
in Lexington,

Williams is 38 and comes from
Spangler, Pennsylvania where he
played his high school football. He
played center for four years at
Syracuse. After graduation in °43
he entered the Air Force as a physi-
cal training instructor. In 1946 he

Washington Of St. Louis
Falls To Generals, 28-0

Washington and Lee’s Generals closed out their first un-
beaten season in 46 years with a resounding 28-0 trouncing of
Washington University in St. Louis, Saturday.

Led by Terry Fohs, who made 26 tackles for the tough
W&L defense, and an array of offensive stars, the Generals
capitalized on six fumbles by the Bears to score twice in each

Union from 9 am. to 5 p.m.

This year’s costumes will represent
various Shakespearean characters.
The members of the figure will depict
characters from six Shakespearean
plays, and the rest of the costumes will
follow suit.

The costumes are coming from the
Hooker Howe Company in Haver-
hill, Massachusetts, through Oak
Hall distributors in Roanoke. This
will be the first time that W&L has
used this company, which normally
outfits professional productions.

There will be 50 new costumes made
for the members of the figure. In addi-
tion to this, there will be almost 200
outfits made especially for this ball.
The costumes will cost the normal
$18 per set for those people who
do not have Dance Plans. However,
those people with Dance Plans receive
the costumes for $16.

Students must be measured for
the following specifications: chest,
waist, height, weight, hat size and
length of outseam. In addition they
must provide the following measure-
ments of their dates: bust, waist,
hips, height, weight, hat size, dress
size, and length of skirt from waist
to ankle. It is important that these
measurements be correct in order
to ensure proper fitting.

The six plays that will be repre-
sented are: Julius Caesar, depicting
the Roman period; Anthony and Cleo-
patra—the Egyptian period; Merchant
of Venice—the Italian renaissance;
Henry IV—the French renaissance;
King Lear—the medieval period; and,
Hamlet—to bring in the Scandinavian
theme.

The first day for costume sales will
be be Monday, Dec. 5.

Ciardi To Open
Lecture Series

Poet-critic John Ciardi will begin
a series of Glasgow-sponsored lectures
on Monday, Nov. 28, at 8:15 p.m. in
duPont Auditorium.

Ciardi,
Rutgers University and a frequent
contributor to the Saturday Review
of Literature, will speak on “The
Last Time I Saw Wordsworth.”

On Tuesday, he’ll return to duPont
at the same hour, this time to lecture
“The Next Time I see Confusion.”
On Wednesday, Ciardi will leave, but

place him.

Humphrey, author of Home from
the Hill, will make two appearances in
duPont Auditorium, each at 8:15 p.m.
His Thursday night lecture will be
entitled, “Figures in a Landscape.” On
Friday his theme will be “Operatic.”

Five days later, on Wednesday,
Dee. 7, television-screen writer Merle
M'ller will arrive in Lexington. Miller,
who adapted The Rains of Ranchipur,
and Kings Go Forth, for the screen, is
scheduled for two appearances.

Wednesday night, he will be in
duPont Auditorium for a lecture on
“The Night Nobody Looked.” The
following evening, he'll be back in
duPont, speaking on “Bach on the
Musical Saw.”

Glasgow Committee Chairman A.
Ross Borden said yesterday that admis-
sion to duPont Auditorium appear-
ances during the series will be by ticket

59-yard run by Joe Hess, a 29-yard
run by Charlie Gummey, a 13-yard
keeper run by quarterback Robin
Wood, and a 38-yard pass from Wood
to halfback Wallace Tiffany.

W&L’s offense, which compiled 286
yards on the ground, was led by
the running of Hess, Gummey and
Tommy Keesee. Hess led with a total
of 93 yards. Gummey added 58 and
Keesee compiled 48.

Fohs and company gave up only
107 rushing yards, mostly in the mid-
dle of the field. The Bear’s Terry Mac-
key, a workhorse all day, got most of
it, a total of 87 yards.

W&L scored its first touchdown with
41/2 minutes left in the first quarter on
Hess’s fine 59-yard run. The senior
fullback from Deerfield, Ill., cut off
right tackle to the sidelines and had
almost a clear field to the goal.

Washington’s Jay Hopkins caught
him from behind on the five, but
Hess fell across the goal for the
score. Wood tried right end for the
¢4wo points, but was thrown back
for a three yard loss. It was 6-0
with 4:36 left in the first quarter.

But W&L couldn’t score again until
there were only 58 seconds remaining
in the first half.

Gummey carried on four of the five
plays it took to score after W&L re-
covered a Bear fumble. His run around
left end carried the last 29 yards for
the score. Gummey also ran the extra-
points, this time around right end, and
W&L took a 14-0 lead at halftime.

The Generals played “cough up the
ball” in the third quarter as the
Bears threatened twice. The Gen-
eral defense, led by the ever-present
Fohs, stopped WU once on _ the
Generals’ 23, and another lost Bear
bobble stopped the second drive
on the W&L 36.

After recovering a third fumble, the
Generals quickly gave the ball back
via a fumble of their own on the
Bear’s 47. Then Hess made an out-
standing defensive play, followed it up
with a fine offensive play, and the
Generals got their third score.

Hess broke through to hit Bear
passer Don McGuire from the blind
side. He almost took McGuires head
off and caused him to lose the ball with
Dan Blain recovering on the WU 31.

Hess then side-stepped his way for
18 yards and Wood ran it over on
the next play. Jim Hickey ran the
extra points to make the score 22-0
with 4:43 left in the game.

Then W&L’s depth definitely began
to pay off as the tough General line
broke through to make the Bear’s of-
fense run backwards and give up the
ball on the WU 42.

One play later, Wood flipped a per-
fect 38-yard pass to Tiffany for the
Generals’ fourth score. His pass to
Windy Weed for extra points was no
good and it was 28-0 with 2:21 remain-
ing.

Coach Lee McLaughlin then ran in
the seniors to finish out the game.

Undefeated Season Gives Pride

We would like to add our word of praise and congratulations
to the Washington and Lee coaching staff and football team
for giving the school its first undefeated season in almost half
a century. They have given something of which Washington
and Lee and all those who are in any way connected may be
exceedingly proud.

 

For several years now we have had to hang our heads and
shuffle our feet uneasily whenever the record of the Washington
and Lee football team has been mentioned. We have suffered
abuse at the hands of many of our friends who attend the neigh-
boring small colleges and even the State University across the
hill. It gave us a feeling of great satisfaction to swagger across
the grounds of these neighboring schools on last Saturday
night, and gloat, along with the rest of our W&L compatriots,
over the second undefeated season in Washington and Lee’s
history.

The boys and the coaches of our 1960 football team have
already become an integral part of Washington and Lee’s tradi-
tions. It has been proposed that maybe the name of the school
should be expanded to read ‘“‘Washington and Lee McLaughlin
University.”” Like the rest of our traditions, our football team
made us proud of our institution.

The boys, as well as the coaches on this year’s team, came to
Washington and Lee when the fortunes of the new “‘amateur”’
program were at their lowest ebb. The University was the laugh-
ing stock of the region. Now after three or four years of patient
watching, working, praying, and waiting, as well as a little suf-
fering on the part of the coaches, the players, and a few diehard
supporters (parents and coaches wives for the most part) , some
of those who came to scoff have returned to praise.

The boys who wear the Blue and White have begun to make
a name for themselves. There has been more than one mention
of the “big, quiet man” that has done so much for Washington
and Lee. There has been less mention of, but no less admiration
for, another big and maybe not so quiet man who has ridden
out the storm and done so much for Washington and Lee’s foot-
ball team at the position of end coach. Nothing more can or
need be said of Coach Charlie Harrington than that he, more
than anybody else, embodied the spirit of amateur football at
Washington and Lee. To the new member of our coaching staff,
we say thanks. We don’t see how they could have done it with-
out you.

These undefeated seasons are the kind of things that most
folks dream about at the end of the season when they begin
to think about next year. It hasn’t been many years since the
folks around here were worrying about snapping their latest
losing streak. Now the shoe is on the other foot, and the worry
about next year is a little more pleasant, but nevertheless it’s
still a worry.

It’s been said that success breeds success, and if that is the
case we have every reason to be optimistic. Just look at next
year’s tri-captains. The team couldn’t have made a better choice.
Check out a few of the freshman prospects; things look pretty
bright there too.

Unfortunately, there is one sour strain in our song of hap-
piness. Washington and Lee is losing some good football players
to graduation and to its three-year cooperative engineering plan.

Things still look pretty good though. Just the other day,
somebody asked when W&L had started giving football scholar-
ships again. That must be some sort of compliment. It shows
that people are thinking about us.

Congratulations again.

Congratulations To The Coach

Our thanks and congratulations to Coach Lee McLaughlin
for bringing us out of the woods. If all the credit had to go to
one man we feel that he would have to take the bows. Encore!

Come Back!

We hate to belabor the point, but its holiday time again
and the police and the drunks are back on the road. If you
don’t worry about your life, think of your pocket book. Speed-
ing can be expensive. Besides, we would like to see everybody
back for the post-Thanksgiving, pre-Christmas round of quizzes.

By HARVEY ALLEN

If the people going to New York
from this area and the various celeb-
rities now in the nation’s largest city
have anything to say about it, this
year’s Thanksgiving vacation should
turn out to be the usual four day
bash.

Of primary interest to all are the
supper clubs and the places where one
can catch some good sounds. Touch-
ing on some of the more familiar
names and locations we find Jonah
Jones holding forth, as usual, at the
Embers. If this year’s anything like
the past few, better check reservations
here.

Birdland, though prone to higher-
than-minimums, presents a good line-
up, maybe even good enough to war-
rant fighting the large crowds and
high prices. Buddy Rich and his group
will move in there from the Metropole
shortly before we arrive and be joined
by Maynard Ferguson, formerly with
Stan Kenton, as arranger and general
trumpet player.

Some time during the four days
you'll want to go by Eddie Condon’s,
an old standby sort of place, currently
featuring one of its alums, Peanuts
Hucko. It’s not dazzling but serves as
a good filler at reasonable prices for
all.

Buddy Rich’s departure from the
Metropole brings in new names and
continues the choice offering there.

 

Sol Yaged and Lionel Hampton will

carry the cause at the location, alter-
nating days and shows.

Sonny Stitt and Miles Davis offer
more of the far out sounds at the
Village Vanguard, while Marian Mc-
Partland will keep things quietly mov-
ing at the Hickory House.

If you’re making the more expensive
spots like Sardi’s and 21, check by
the Copa on comedian Joey Bishop and
the Four Lads. While we’re on singers,
it'll bear mentioning that Johnny Ray
will be appearing at Basin Street East,
along with Quincy Jones, who is some-
what less well known.

In midtown Manhattan there’s a
place that’s just been open a little
over a year, called The Roundtable.
The first W&L crowd went there last
Thanksgiving and they all gave the
place rave notices. Tyree Glenn can
generally be counted on to be around
and it’s not unusual to see Steve Allen
drop by and sit in for a few choruses.
Glenn will be around with added at-
traction Adam Wade and the man with
the exotic sounds from “the islands,”
Martin Denny.

A frequently overlooked or unknown
spot to people around here is Upstairs
at the Downstairs, which has featured
the reviews of Julius Monk for some
time now. His latest is “a formal
affair dedicated to rattling the skele-

| The latter may be difficult to get to

 

tons in the closets of Park Avenue,
Broadway, Washington, and Fort |
Lauderdale.”

Finally, on the music and supper |

club scene there’s the Jazz Gallery,
currently hosting Thelonius Monk.
Here again is one for the more devoted
of the strictly jazz group.

Along the lines of general comments
and long-established spots, dancable
sounds will pervade the Roosevelt Grill
to the tune of Warren Covington and
his Tommy Dorsey Orchestra.

The Hotel Lexington will doubtless
continue its general polynesian theme
in its Hawaiian Room, if the prices at
the Roundtable are too much or you
want more of the Martin Denny-type
thing.

Carnegie Hall will feature two
evenings of entertainment of more than
passing interest. Iconoclast Mort Sahl
appears Friday night, following the
Kingston Trio’s Wednesday night spot.

or impossible, depending on your ar-
rival time plans for said day.

For a good view, good drinks, and
good quiet music, you'll need to visit
the Rainbow Room in the RCA build-
ing, if you haven't already. It’s sort
of a cinerama-globeramic-sized cock-
tail lounge, large enough to float
multi cocktail olives, simultaneously. A
trio is usually the musical fare here.

As for Broadway shows, most of the
familiar long runs are still on. Things
like “Take Me Along,” “Bye Bye
Birdie,” “Fiorello!” “Gypsy,” “The

Music Man,” and “The Sound of Mu- |

sic.”

The Big City Highlights Good Shows

For Coming Weekend Entertainment

for these you might as well forget
about them. Unless of course you don’t
care how much you pay for the tickets,
over and above the list price. The best
chances would probably be “The Mu-
sic Man” and “Gypsy,” since they have
both long since lost their original lead-
ing stars.

In the realm of dramas and plays,
there are several that look good and
have gotten good reviews, including
Tennessee Williams’ new one, “Period
of Adjustment.”

Other good shows include “The Mir-
acle Worker,” the life of Helen Keller,
“The Tenth Man,” “A Therber Carni-
val,” which stars Therber himself,
“Becket,” with Anthony Quinn and
Sir Laurence Oliver. Jack Lemmon’s
in a new one called “Face of a Hero,”
while the well publicized play by
Gore Vidol, “The Best Man,” stars
Melvin Douglas and Frank Lovejoy,
and enjoys good house nightly.

For a final touch, with football fans
primarily in mind, there’s action on
Thanksgiving Day at the Polo Grounds.
The Dallas Texans meet the New York
Titans there at 11 in the morning.

Generally, that’s about the best of
the New York scene, exclusive of
special exhibitions, art galleries, and
main points of tourist interest.

For details of these and other pos-
sible activities, check the current issue
of the New Yorker, to which we are
indebted for most of our information.

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

With Autumn past the half-way
mark and gridiron schedules nearly
completed, its particularly fitting to
look back on some of the grander mo-
ments the game afforded us this season.
Big and little college ball have re-
ceived their share of publicity, as
have high school (and, in the Roanoke
papers, sand lot) and junior high
school ball. Various coaches, players
and teams will be selected to this or
that all-something or named to this
or that particular honor, and the pig-
skin season will become just another
memory to be mulled over in front of a
pleasant winter fireplace.

And yet true connoisseurs of the art
of carrying leather up and down the
greensward will know that something
is lacking, that credit was not given
where credit was due. That is to the
roughest fastest, trickiest band of
football in this part of the Common-
wealth, the football played in the
little dell across the street from the
University Cleaners. The boys who do
or die down there don’t do it for
money or for glory, but for the love
of the game, as any of the fans who
watch can testify. For those of you who
haven’t seen this Lexington version of
classic Americana, permit me to de-
scribe a typical afternoon’s game.

The casual passerby on his way
to the Paramount will probably
notice, just after three o’clock, a few
clean-limbed young lads about the
dell throwing the football and other-
wise working off their youthful ex-
ubance after a confining day at
school. Gradually, almost impercept-
ibly, the number of boys frolicking
like young goats increases, and soon,
in the irrepressible competitive spirit
of untrammelled youth, sides are
chosen and a game begins.

At the same time, and as imprecept-
ibly, a crowd begins to gather around
the hedge. At its peak it will consist
of a few dyspeptic students, a couple
of idle cab drivers, and some young
ladies up to the age of fourteen, but
looking considerably more nubile.

In common with true sportsmen
everywhere, the crowd is basically
uninterested in the score. “It’s not
whether you win or lose, but how
you played the game.” And they sure

able crowd to its feet. A bone-jarring

placed elbow... these are what count.
And if the girls, in their excitement, oc-
casionally let fly an expeletive not
usually considered lady-like, why, who
can help but forgive them their mo-
mentary indiscretion. Evil to him who
evil thinks, I always say.

After a while, players of a duskier
hue show up, and begin “having a
catch” on the periphery of the regu-
lar game. This (although it is a regu-
lar occurrence) causes the other
players to huddle and discuss the
new situation. When enough players
of the other shade appear, the gaunt-
let, as it were, is cast down, and an
interracial game begins. Both sides
play determinedly, for honor is at
stake. And the spectators are witness

 

to a world struggle in microcosm.

Recently, however, these struggles

Mudlot Football Is Clash For Honor

have changed in character, for the
teams are mixed. Sociologists would
make much of that although it’s only
a game, if it wern’t for the fact that
they much preferred to travel about in
the South Seas, Pago-Pago and so
forth,

But as they say, it’s not who won,
but how the game was played, and
if you don’t play well enough to win,
we sportswriters just haven’t much
time for you.

Singing Group Goes North;
Sazeracs To Entertain
At Massachusetts Cotillion

The Washington and Lee Sazeracs
travel to Worcester, Mass., this week-
end to sing at the Worcester Cotillion
and a dinner party to precede it. The
Cotillion is one of the outstanding
debutante events in the area.

This is the first time the Sazeracs
have accepted an engagement over
the Thanksgiving Holidays. In the past,
the group has always confined its va-
cation activities to their trip to Florida
in the Spring. For the past four seasons,
the Sazeracs have spent the Spring
Holiday at the Colonnades Hotel in
Palm Beach Shores. They have been
invited to return again this year.

Founded in 1955 and named after
the famous bar and patented drink
in the Hotel Roosevelt in New Or-
leans, the Sazeracs have charmed
audiences of all ages since then.

The 1960-61 Sazeracs are: Huntley
Biggs, President and Director, Billy
Martin, Business Manager and Treas-
urer, Dave Knight, Bill Heald, Dave
Peters, Henry Harrell, Wally Cox,
Hardie Karrh, Bob Van Rennsalaer,
and freshmen Eric Wilson and Jo
Tartt.

_ Adding New Songs

The Sazeracs are currently adding
many new songs to their repetoire
and abandoning some of the ones that
they feel have been with the group too
long. President Huntley Biggs says
that the group feels that the only way
they can give consistently fresh per-
formances is to regularly add fresh
material.

To Cut Record
Further plans for this year include
the cutting of a 12” record in February
and the possible use of guitars, bongo
drums and other instruments in some
number in the repetoire.

Plans To Remodel Lee Chapel

While all this is going on, I hope that
the University might find some more
appropriate place to hang those mis-
cellaneous portraits. The front wall
should be devoted entirely to Lee and
Washington.

Progress, being leisurely around
here, is doubly welcome when it ar-
rives. The last major renovation of the
chapel was done in 1883, when the
back portion was extended and the
recumbent statue of Lee was placed.

Around 1925, the museum area was
remodeled.

Once, creeping through the organ
loft, I came across various notes on
the wall that had been written by
a before the turn of the cen-
ury.

No one discussed it much, but the
balconies were condemned last spring
as unsafe for use,

We hope the remodeling plans will
come to fruition. It is only fitting that
this chapel, the resting-place of a
great family and the meeting-place for
a potentially great University, should
be a permanent and attractive adjunct
to our campus.

A Backward Look At A P

By AL CURRAN

For the first time in forty-six sea-
sons Washington and Lee’s fighting
Five-Star Generals have gone through
their football schedule undefeated. In
four short years the W&L squad has
come from the depths of football medi-
ocrity into the select ranks of the un-
beaten.

The 1960 team has shown all of the
talents which makes a football team
great, a fine offense, a stubborn de-
fense, fine coaching and most of all,
the will to work and win. Rolling up
a total of 196 points in nine games,
the Generals showed wide versatility
in the scoring department. Bob Funk-
houser and Charlie Gummey shared
team scoring honors with 28 points
apiece. Both Funkhouser and Gum-
mey played out of the left halfback
position with Gummey moving up to
the “blue”
Funkhouser was sidelined after the
Hopkins game with a kidney ailment.
Doug Martin, Jim Hickey, Steve Sut-
tle and Ned Hobbs were all close to
the leaders, each scoring 18 points or
better. Fullback Martin led the team
in total rushing with a net season’s
gain of 619 yards.

Fine quarterbacking by juniors
Steve Suttle and Robin Wood kept
the General offense clicking through-
out the season. Suttle, always an
extremely dangerous runner, de-
veloped into an effective and reliable
passer to fill the gap left by Jack
Groner, W&L’s passing ace of 1959
and all-time General great. Wood
as signal-caller of the “red” unit
sparked his team on numerous
touchdown drives. Although lighter
than Suttle, he has demonstrated
good running ability, and as a left
handed passer he has shown great
potential.

The key to the Generals’ offensive
power centered around the strong line
headed by senior tri-captain Court-
ney Mauzy at center. Guards Tommy
Goodwin, George Cruger, Barton
Dick and Bill Willes provided the
interior blocking which enabled the
General ground game to function so
effectively through the middle. It was
Goodwin who landed the key block
that broke Tommy Keesee loose for

power to spring the fast General :

outstanding performance in every |

 

game of the season. Opposing teams |‘

averaged a scant 5.1 points per
game against the Generals. No team
scored more than once against W&L
while Carnegie Tech and Washing- |
ton were held scoreless, |

 

Undisputed leader of the defensive |
unit throughout his three seasons on
the team has been W&L’s Little All- |
American candidate, Terry Fohs.|

collegiate football first. Described by
opponents as “too small to block; too
fast to fall on; impossible to hurt and
a ferocious ankle-high tackler,” Fohs
has been outstanding in every game.
In Saturday’s game against Washing-
ton, Fohs was credited with 26 tackles,
a season’s record. In the Hopkins game
Fohs made 23 tackles and led the
Generals defense in stopping repeated
Hopkins scoring threats. It was the
spirited defense which saved the day
for the Generals and allowed the team
to salvage an 8-8 tie with the power-
ful Blue Jays, who were also unde-
feated at that time. Aside from his

 

great tackling ability, Fohs also led | practice, and many of those that did

the team in pass interceptions with
four. Fohs timely pass interceptions in
the waning moments of the Hampden-
Sydney game snuffed out the last |
Tiger hopes for an upset.

However, Fohs has not been the only
General defensive star. Linemen Bar-
ton Dick, Tommy Goodwin, Tom
Budd, Bill Wheeler and Ned Hobbs
have been particularly hard on the op-
position. Backs Joe Hess, Wayne
Bradshaw and Richard Mosby have |
been stalwarts in the defensive sec- |
ondary. Hess has turned in many fine
performances throughout the season
and was especially effective in last
Saturday’s victory.

Certainly no one would question
the fact that team depth has been
one of the main assets of the 1960
team. In 1957, when Coach Lee Mc-
Laughlin took over as head coach, he
had 19 men turn out for fall football

 

come out had little or no varsity ex-
perience. The 1957 season turned out
to be the most dismal year in W&L
football history because the Generals

| lost eight games without a win. A

measure of the great progress Coach
McLaughlin has made was evidenced
at the start of the 1960 season when
28 lettermen, a handful of players
with limited varsity experience and
about 15 promising sophomores were
our for the team.

Throughout the season McLaughlin
used his depth resource skillfully and
with good results. The Generals were
able to wear down the opposition by
frequent substituting of playing units.
The substituting also developed many
of the less experienced men and
kept enthusiasm up among all players.
The great advantage of depth was felt
when injuries began to pile up. When

No review could be complete with-
out some words of praise for Coach
Lee McLaughlin, assistant coaches
Boyd Williams and Buck Leslie and

|| trainer Norris Eastman. Operating un-

der the unsubsidized program which
he inherited upon his arrival at W&L
in 1957, Coach McLaughlin with the
aid of his assistants developed an un-

} defeated football team in four seasons.

A decade ago W&L had its most
celebrated subsidized team which, led

and Walt

and brought the Southern Conference
championship to W&L. The team lost

: only to national champion Tennessee,

27-21, and to Virginia, 26-21. The
1959 team played in the Gator Bowl
and was defeated by the University of
Wyoming, 21-7. After 1950 the team de-
teriorated rapidly. The University
was forced to cancel the 1954 schedule
because of a lack of players. It was

“| also in 1954 that the W&L policy of

non-subsidization was adopted. The
poor records of the teams of the fifties
tipped W&L’s all-time won-lost rec-
ord to the “loss” column for the first
time in W&L history. Although the
record now stands at 229 wins, 243
losses, 3) ties (since 1890), it now ap-
pears that it won’t be too long before
the Generals show a victory “profit” on
the ledger.

Footballers Already Look Forward To Next Season

By BILL ROBERTS

Washington and Lee finished its first
undefeated football season Saturday.
For eight months, the players and
coaches will be released from the
constant tension which prevails
through a season when you have to
win every game.

But the odds are heavy that most of
them are already thinking about next
season. And they will have to in
order to produce another record like
this year’s.

If there is one thing about the
schedule W&L plays that is certain, it
is that you can’t let up. Any team on
our schedule could have beaten us
this year. Next year’s team will run
up against even tougher opposition
with the addition of Davidson and
Emory and Henry on the slate. Each
one is tougher than anyone we played
this year.

Serious recruiting efforts began
last night when Coach McLaughlin
and a few of his prize backs at-
tended the E. C. Glass High School
football banquet in Lynchburg.
Coach McLaughlin will spend a lot
of time on the road this winter, try-
ing to round up the horses to keep

what we hope will become a winning
tradition.

The players are enjoying their re-
lease from training rules and exper-
iencing the pleasant difficulty of de-
ciding what to do with their after-
noons right now.
Injuries Mended

By the end of a nine-game schedule
there are a substantial number of
players out with injuries and an
even larger number limping from one
thing or another. Now is the time for
those strained muscles and banged-
up knees to mend. But they will have
to do more than mend—before we are
back long from Thanksgiving vacation
Trainer Norris Eastman will have all
the “cripples” working just as hard
as they did during the season trying
to strengthen their weak limbs and
joints.

Freshman and sophomore football
players have usually been placed in a
special afternoon P.E. class for the
rest of the second semester. Most
of the juniors or seniors on the team
attend these sessions to stay in shape
and just have a good time playing
basketball, or handball, or water polo.
