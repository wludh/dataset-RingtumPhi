Debate Team Defeated:
Buice Gains Final Round In
Extemporaneous Speaking

Despite the cruelest storm of New
England’s bitterest winter in more
than forty years—including temper-
atures reading ten below zero and
a blizzard that dropped fourteen
inches of snow in les than twenty-
four hours—the debate team still
made a credible showing in the
Eighth Annual Harvard University
Forensic Tournament held at Cam-
bridge Feb. 2, 3, and 4.

Bill Buice taking part in the Ex-
temporaneous Speaking Contest sur-
vived the preliminary round, ad-
vanced to the finals and was judged
one of the top six speakers from a
list of at least seventy-five students
representing some fifty schools. Bill
Boardman, Pete Struab, and John
Court also were entered in this
contest.

In debating, Buice and Boardman
debated both sides of the question—
Resolved: That the United States
should adopt a program of compul-
sory health insurance for all citizens.
Washington and Lee drew in two
rounds back-to-back Holy Cross,
the strongest Eastern team at the
tournament, and then Northwestern’s
National championship team 1958-
1960. These were the only two teams
from a field of seventy-five schools
including Harvard and Dartmouth.

 

IRW Opens In Chapel Tonight
With Speech By Eminent Socialist

By TOM LYBASS

Norman Thomas, eminent Ameri-
can exponent of socialism, opens
Washington and Lee’s Seventh An-
nual International Relations Week
tonight at 7:15 p.m. at Lee Chapel
with an address entitled “An Ameri-
can Socialist Views the East-West
Conflict.”

Tomorrow night Dr. Malcolm
Moos, former aide to President
Eisenhower, speaks on “The Presi-
dency and Foreign Affairs.” The
time for the lecture has been
changed from the previously an-
nounced 8 to 7:30 p.m.

The third speaker in the series,
Dr. Abraham Kreusler, chairman of
the Department of Russian Studies
at Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege,
lations Week with a lecture on “The
True Nature of the Russian Chal-
lenge” on Thursday night.

The speakers differ in points of
view. Effective spokesman for their
positions, Thomas, Moos, and Kreus-
ler will state their views on foreign
policy, especially as it is involved
with the Free World’s efforts to
counter the Sino-Soviet threat.

Mr. Thomas, described by one ob-
server as a “well-educated, articu-
late Princetonian,” will be the
spokesman for liberal thought.
Drawing from at least forty years
in public affairs, Thomas is expected
to display the powers which have

concludes International Re--

made him a creative and construc-
tive thinker in the American liberal
movement.

Dr. Moos, who soon will resume his
duties as Professor of Political Sci-
ence at Johns Hopkins University,
after having served as President
Eisenhower’s speech writer, is ex-
pected to give a reasoned statement
of the Administration’s position.

Dr. Kreusler, holding a doctorate
from the University of Cracow (Po-
land), came to the United States
from the Western Ukraine in 1947.
His lecture Thursday night concerns
post-Stelinist developments in Rus-
sia and their implications for the
West. It is his contention that the
Russian government is under great
pressure internally to make peaceful
approsches toward the West and
that this pressure presents the West
with a great opportunity for nego-
tiation.

Complimenting Washington and
Lee’s IRC Week will be a similar
program at VMI next week. The
theme will be “The United Nations
and the World-Power Conflict.”

Dr. Joseph Johnson, President of
the Carnegie Endowment for Inter-
national Peace, will be the featured
speaker. He is scheduled to lecture
in Jackson Hall on Thursday, Feb.
16. The public is invited.

Dr. Johnson was born at Longdale
Furnace, Virginia, just outside Rock-

 

bridge County, near Clifton Forge.

 

To Be Shown

By RICHARD CRUSE

A photography exhibit from the
Metropolitan Museum of Fine Arts
in New York City will be shown
here Feb. 13-27 in duPont Hall. The
program is being sponsored by Dr.
Marion Junkin, professor of art at
Washington and Lee. Dr. Junkin
said that this collection is reputed
to be one of the finest exhibits of
photography ever shown.

The display consists of eighty-five
pictures, fifty-five in black and white
and thirty in color. The photographs
were chosen by a board of experts
who reviewed thousands of pictures
from many sources including popu-
lar and specialized magazines, in-
dustrial libraries, advertising agen-
cies, the Pulitzer Prize Committee’s
resources at Columbia University, art
schools, agents, art directors, and
other authorities in the field of pho-
tography. Many of the pictures se-
lected were by such distinguished
photographers as Phillip Harrington,
Leo Lionni, John Vachon, Bob

Eisenstadt.
Ivan Dimitri, a member of the
council of photography in the Fine

view that “Each of the photographs
had evoked or communicated an idea,
a mood or an emotion; each had been
created with artistic integrity and an
aesthetic appeal.” He goes on to say
that “These are not the greatest
photographs of this or any time.
These are some of the fine photo-
graphs that are, however, represen-

 

photographers. ...there is no precise

tographs, or doodles. This exhibit |
is no more than it purports to be.”

1961, Dean William W. Pusey, III,
announced today.

The awards, ranging from $200 to
$900 in individual stipends, are part
of a Washington and Lee program
which promotes continuing scholar-
ship among faculty members and in-
creasing teaching effectiveness in
classrooms and laboratories.

Now in its eighth year, the pro-
gram, is supported by the John M.

Mr. Huntley

Will Study And Teach At Harvard University Next Fall

Robert E. R. Huntley, associate
professor of law at Washington and
Lee University, has been granted
a $6,750 Fellowship in Law Teach-
ing for a year’s study at Harvard
University.

He will begin his studies in Sep-
tember and resume his teaching
duties at Washington and Lee in
September, 1962, according to Law
School Dean Charles P. Light, Jr.

The special grant comes from funds
at Harvard.

Huntley, who received his A.B.
degree from Washington and Lee in
1950 and his LL.B. (summa cum
laude) here in 1957, has been a mem-
ber of the university’s faculty since
1958. He was associated with the
Alexandria law firm of Boothe,
Dudley, Koontz & Boothe for a year
after his graduation. He is 31.

A member of Phi Beta Kappa and
Order of the Coif, Huntley served

Bob Allen has been selected by
Troubadour director Cecil D. Jones
to act the title role in the forth-
coming Troub production of Pir-
andello’s “Henry IV.” Bob has ap-
peared frequently on the Henry
Street stage, his last appearance
being in this season’s opening pro-
duction, “The Lady’s not for Burn-
ing.”

There are two women’s roles in the
play, which deals with the actions
of a wealthy Italian aristocrat who
imagines himself to be the German
emperor Henry IV. Susan Howard,

 

a Lexington High School senior, a

 

not been set as yet.

veteran Troubadour, plays an at-
tractive niece of Henry IV. Mrs. Bet-
ty Saunders, a Lexington housewife,
will be performing in Lexington for
the first time as his sister.

Three freshmen are making their
Troubadour debuts in this produc-
tion. They are Bob Aylin, playing
one of Henry’s courtiers, Bill Gotten,
as a servant and Bob Fussell as a
member of the Italian nobility. Andy
Adelson, appearing as a member of
the royal retenue, is making his first
appearance also.

The Troub business manager
Frank D’Lauro who has served the

 

Troubs Select Cast For “Henry IV’

theatre in backstage capacities for
three years has for the first time ac-
cepted an acting role. He, along
with Troub favorites John Dunnell
and Mervyn Clay, makes up the rest
of Henry IV’s court.

Three popular Troubadours are
presenting character roles in Henry
IV. Tim Morton, who stopped the
show in “The Lady’s not for Burn-
ing,” is playing the Baron Tito
Belcredi. Jim Applebaum, making his
return to the Troub stage after a
season’s absence, portrays a psy-

chologist, and Scott Iacone is appear-
ing as Henry’s faithful servant.

Hell Week Again

Last week we suggested two alternatives to the hell and help
week controversy. 1) That the students take it upon themselves
to do away with the most barbarous practices connected with
the old help week and attempt to turn the week into a help
week emphasizing constructive work within the various houses
and around the community. 2) That the administration take
some action on the matter which would put an end to any week
of strenuous activity prior to initiation into the fraternity.

We feel that such a week is necessary. We trust that the ad-
ministration will take no immediate action. In the event that no
adminstrative action is taken, we hope that the students will

take it upon themselves to work

out through the various organs

of student government some sort of plan to turn hell week into

the much discussed help week.

The Interfraternity Council is the obvious place to initiate
action. This body can do nothing without student support, which
it has every right to expect, despite the failure of the plan for
a help week that was turned down in a final vote Monday

before exams began.

In past years, Washington and Lee has been unique in the
amount of free student government that has been maintained,
especially with regard to matters concerning the fraternity sys-
tem and other social activities. Of late, the trend has been to-
ward more administrative restriction in fields formally left to
the student government. (EC, IFC, Dance Board, etc.)

We hope that in the future this trend will reverse itself, and
that the reins of student government will tend to fall back into
the hands of the students. This goal can be attained only if
the students are willing to make changes which are in keeping
with the general trend of events on our campus.

If the individual students will empower their IFC repre-

sentatives

to agree to some plan similar to the “positive-

negative” plan worked out and presented to the students during
the first semester, the necessity for administrative action con-
cerning the hell week problem will be eliminated.

Concerning Mr. Thomas...

Norman Thomas, who speaks tonight in Lee Chapel, has
earned a reputation as a far-sighted political observer. On num-
erous occasons he has predicted future problems and their
sources far before other observers. The article on this page
tells of his stands in the past which, while strongly opposed,
have been proven wise and eminently practical by time.

Mr. Thomas has long been respected by both his supporters
and his political opponents as a man who combines the highest
idealism with a sure grasp of political and economic realities.
And history has shown him less a visionary than an eminently
practical and worthwhile contributor to our contemporary
theory of government. It will be interesting to hear what he

has to say tonight.

Case Of The Missing Reserve Book
Or, Major Foxes The Old Man

(Today’s column is written by
avant-garde novelist PAUL T.
WILLIS.)

“Gentlemen,” the professor said,
“I've found a book which comes
closer than any other on this
subject. It’s called An Englishman
Looks at Ultimate Truth, by Plautus
McTotter. I want you all to read it
and write a short report for future
reference. It will be on the reserve
shelf.”

It was Thursday, and we had a
big quiz scheduled for the coming
Tuesday. If past performances could
be any clue, the basis for the quiz
would be found right in that reserve

| book. I looked at Igor and he at me;

we knew what must be done.
After class he followed me down-
stairs as I pretended to buy a Coke.

“What about this quiz?” he said.
“Looks pretty tough,” I said.

Well, you know what to do. Ill
meet you in the stacks at quarter
past four.”

as * *

When I got to the library a little
after four, I could tell it wasn’t go-
ing to be easy. The Old Man was on
the desk. I stood for a minute pre-
tending to look over the new books,

 

then walked quickly to the card ecata-
logue, pulling out “A-Ambivalent.”

U. S. Threatened With Commune Spirit

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

Recent press reports indicate that
the Communist Chinese are giving
up some of the more stringent re-
quirements of their communes, ad-
mitting that communal incentive is
not providing the “Great Leap For-
ward” with the necessary thrust. In
the United States we all cluck our
tongues and point with horror at the
excesses of the Chinese communes,
thinking smugly we would never be
so ignorant.

We too, however, are victims of
the communal trend, even if not to
so great an extent. Right here at
Washington and Lee we have the
Commons, the avowed purpose of
which is to create a more communal
feeling (it may be differently ex-

 

pressed) among the freshmen. Lead-
ing voices on campus, both faculty
and student, denounce the fraternity
system as a divisive influence (thus:
non-communal).

On a larger scale, we have group-
therapy, group dynamics, the nation-
al government has task force, teams,
and even a committee on National
Purpose.

The small groups, like fraternities,
Commons, etc., are harmless because
they contain too few individuals.
Nations, however, are in danger be-
cause their very size renders con-
trol of the group by its individual
members impossible, and a nation
has life of its own, separate from the
citizenry.

So long as the nation exists pri-

 

marily to provide an orderly society
for its individual citizens, there is
little danger. When, however, it also
takes on functions properly belong-
ing to individuals or smaller groups
within the nation, it becomes a state,
a living thing. When these functions
come under national control, the
power of the individual to change
policy is greatly diluted, and the
power of the national bureaucrats
or managers is correspondingly
strengthened. A bureaucrat tends to
regard the function which he serves
as an end in itself, and will strive
to keep it in existence even if its
purpose has ended. Enough of these
functions and bureaucrats will give
a state the most important character-

The Old Man was grinning faintly
as he made up his fatal third notices.
Time was passing, but there was no
chance to slip by the desk while
The Old Man was glancing about,
letting nothing escape him.

My break came with something I
hadn’t dared hope for. A freshman
approached the desk and tried to
talk The Old Man out of the key
to the locked stacks. He’d heard
about the erotica collected at some
of the northern schools, and had high
hopes.

The excoriation which ensued so
completely occupied The Old Man
that I was able to slip unnoticed into
the stacks. I made out a shadowy
figure behind the back issues of
The Yale Review.

“Did you get it?” I asked.

“Look here,” said Igor, and
pulled the McTotter book from be-
tween the leaves of the Times Lit-
erary Supplement. “They’ll never
miss that.”

I nodded at him as he folded the
paper carefully and shoved it under
the shelf. We went to the small glass
porthole in the door and could see
another man from the class trying to
find the book in the reserve stacks.
He looked a little sad as he searched
in vain; but he was a Commerce man
who'd strayed into this course by
some accident. Besides, he was pretty
smart and could possibly beat us

Thomas Talks
Here Tonight

Norman Thomas’s long career in
American politics has been charac-
terized by an articulate and out-
spoken analysis of issues over 40
years. In his seven campaigns as
Socialist party candidate for presi-
dent of the United States he has
often squarely opposed the Demo-
cratic and Republican party stands
on current issues.

During the 1930’s, Mr. Thomas set
the keynote for his campaign when
he said that American voters in vot-
ing for either the Republican or
Democratic parties were only choos-
ing the lesser of two evils. He said
that the two major parties were “as
alike as Tweedledum and Tweedle-
dee” and that they were “like iden-
tical glass bottles with different
labels and both empty.”

He took the same stand on the
Kennedy-Nixon campaign this fall.

Mr. Thomas's high point as a pres-
idential candidate and the high point
of the Socialist party was reached in
the depression election of 1932, when
he polled 884,781 votes. Many of the
programs Mr. Thomas proposed to
relieve unemployment—such as pub-
lic works, unemployment insurance
as a part of a broad social security
scheme, and shortening of the work
week—were adopted as part of the
Roosevelt administration New Deal.

In 1944, Mr. Thomas acknowledged
that the Socialist party no longer
existed as an electoral force, but he
has always held that the influence
of the party was great enough to
justify its active participation in
presidential campaigns.

Mr. Thomas has been a prolific
writer of books and magazine arti-
cles. In the past five years he has
been particularly outspoken on for-
eign affairs, including articles in the
New York Times magazine, the Sat-
urday Review, and the Reporter. His
interest in foreign affairs have been
broad, ranging from studies of area
problems like those of the Middle
East to wider topics like disarma-
ment and conflict of “isms.”

Mr. Thomas distinguished him-
self throughout the late 1930’s and
the Second World War by his per-
sistent warning of the potential
danger of Russian communism un-
der Stalin.

As head of the Socialist party,
Mr. Thomas always insisted that so-
cial change should not be brought
about by force. He was never a
Marxist himself and his leadership
drove the communists out of the
Socialist party.

In 1934, Mr. Thomas created a
split among his followers on the
problem of “collective security.” He
thought that the United States should
join the World Court and the League
of Nations and should take the lead
in disarmament. But he cautioned
against getting into any wars “to
enforce peace” or supporting other
nations in military or economic war
against “agressor nations.”

During World War II, Mr. Thomas
attacked the Roosevelt administra-
tion as a virtual dictatorship and
claimed there had been a marked de-
cline in civil liberties. He condemned
allied demands for an unconditional
surrender and charged that the U.S.
was fighting to sustain the Russian
and British empires.

The 1944 Socialist party platform

Moos Wrote
For ‘Ike’

For the past two years Malcolm
C. Moos (pronounced Moose) served
as administrative assistant to the
President in charge of speech writ-
ing. In this capacity he was always
responsible for Eisenhower’s major
speeches, but he should have credit
for many of Eisenhower’s remarks.

Dr. Moos is a long time student
of politics, serving as a professor of
political science at Johns Hopkins
University. He was originally sum-
moned to the White House in 1957
to assist Dr. Arthur K. Larson in
the preparation of the President’s
speeches. Shortly after Larson’s res-
ignation Moos was appointed to take
over his place. He was not a new man
on the Eisenhower team, having
joined the Eisenhower bandwagon in
December 1951.

In order to be chosen as a speech
writer for the President, a man must
think and write in a manner that
resembles that of the President.
Moos was no exception to this rule.
He has often been classified as a
Modern Republican or Eisenhower
Republican. Earlier he was grouped
with the Willkie Republicans, and
then later with the Dewey Repub-
licans. These are pretty much the
same schools that have now been
succeeded by Eisenhower, Nixon, and
Lodge.

For the most part this group ad-
vocates an internationalism in world
politics. Willkie’s platform in 1940
stood for aid to peoples resisting
aggression; aid to allies of the United
States; the bolstering of national de-
fenses; and, a firm attempt at keep-
ing the nation out of war. After his
defeat Willkie worked at maintain-
ing a bipartisan foreign policy.

Four years later when Dewey ran
for President, he also upheld a
foreign policy based on large-scale
international cooperation. After
World War II the Republicans de-
veloped differences that slowly split
the party into two separate groups.
One group headed by the late Sen-
ator Taft of Ohio adopted a policy
that could generally be labled iso-
lationist. The other, behind Dewey,
was more often considered interna-
tionalist, and this is the group that
we know today as Modern Republi-
cans.

In 1952 when Eisenhower first ran
for President, he too found his home
among this group of internationalists.
Early in his campaign he was men-
tioning policies of “liberation, not
containment,” and “seizing the Cold
War offensive. This did, however,
develop into a program of contain-
ment and dollar diplomacy. In 1954
Eisenhower, a moderate, was faced
with the problem of appeasing right-
wing Republicans. After the death
of Senator Taft he found himself
confronted with a strong movement
on the part of rear guard Republi-
cans to limit his treaty making
power, by requiring Congressional
or Senatorial approval of Executive
agreements. This plan, commonly
known as the Bricker Amendment,
was sponsored by Senator Bricker
from Ohio. Eishenhower and the
more liberal Republicans voiced
strong disapproval for the measure
which was eventually defeated. Dur-
ing the 1958 Congressional elections
many of these right-wingers retired
or were defeated and Eisenhower

The Pros And

By JOHN PAUL

President Kennedy has appointed
Glenn T. Seaborg, 48, to be the new
chairman of the Atomic Energy Com-
mission. The new appointee has sev-
eral characteristics which distinguish
him markedly from his predecessors:
he is himself a physicist, a member
of the faculty of the University of
California at Berkeley, and a recipi-
ent of the Nobel Prize. Seaborg won
the Nobel Prize in 1951 with Edwin
MeMilan for his contribution to the
discovery of Plutonium.

Seaborg is assuming important new
duties at a highly critical time. For
two years the United States has been
suspending nuclear weapons tests.
This moratorium on tests has been
a subject of much dispute and the
issue today awaits President Ken-
nedy’s resolution. What action the
President takes either in affirming
our present ban or in changing
policy will, to a great extent, de-
pend upon the recommendations of
the Atomic Energy Commission.

In the month of December the is-
sue and its perplexities were brought

 

forth eloquently by two separate ad-
dresses. These two addresses sum-
marized the conflict in viewpoint
very well. A brief summary of the
ideas of these two speeches expressed
is given below. Read them, if you
will, with an eye towards ascertaining
which of these two dramatically op-
posing points of view is the most
valid.

In a speech at Yale University on
December 5, Hon. Thomas E. Murray,
a former member of the AEC, pre-
sented “The Case for Resuming Nu-
clear Tests.” On December 27, Sir
Charles Percy Snow presented an
opposing view in an address to the
American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science meeting in New
York City. Sir Charles is a remark-
able British scientist who has served
with distinction for fifteen years in
his country’s civil service and who is
also the author of a series of novels
which have dealt mostly with a pres-
entation of the scientist and the
scientific life.

Sir Charles’ address stressed the
dangers of nuclear weapons and ap-
pealed to the scientist to accept the

 

ons Of

humanitarian aspects of science. He
pictured today’s physicist as a sol-
dier without a uniform unable to es-
eape from the moral escalator on
which he is riding. He admitted that
the initial step was proper in order
to avert the catastrophe of a Nazi
victory, but that subsequently scient-
ists have lost their moral respon-
sibility. “A soldier has to obey,” said
Snow, “for that is the foundation of
his morality. It is not the foundation
of the scientific morality. Scientists
have to question and if necessary to
rebel.”

Snow then proceeded to outline
with brutal certainty the ever in-
creasing dangers of nuclear annihi-
lation. Today four powers have
nuclear capabilities. “Within, at the
most six years, China and several
other states will have a stock of nu-
clear bombs. Within, at the most, ten
years, some of these bombs are going
3 Through accident, or folly,
or madness—but the motives don’t
matter...”

Thus the scientist, Sir Charles
maintained, has the duty to make
these facts clear to the world at large.

 

The A-

Today’s scientist must not succumb
to blind obedience to an overpower-
ing organization. He must face his
moral responsibility.

Mr. Murray’s address contered on
the practical importance of maintain-
ing at least nuclear parity with the
U.S.S.R., if not a distinct advantage.
He called for a lifting of the ban on
nuclear tests conducted either under-
ground or in outer space “not merely
to enlarge our scientific knowledge
of seismic or outerspace phenomena
but also and explicitly to develop
technology of nuclear weapons.” He
pointed out that our policy has not
achieved any of its objectives in that
it has failed to convince the Russians
that we are not implacable warmon-
gers and that we are willing to end
the arms race; it has not placated
world opinion and persuaded people
of our peaceful intentions; it has not
moderated neutralist sentiment; it
has not furthered the Geneva dis-
armament talks appreciably; and it
has not diminished the fear of war.

From the political standpoint the
weapons testing ban has been a
failure. From the military standpoint

 

est Controversy

the policy has been crippling. We
have lost ground to the Russians in
that they have no doubt continued
their nuclear advance stealthily.

Murray pointed out that the field
of nuclear technology is in its in-
fancy, that the H-Bomb is by no
means the ultimate weapon. In hint-
ing that new goodies are in the offing,
Murray spoke of “a third-genera-
tion” weapon, much more advanced
upon the present nuclear bombs.
“The new weapon will not be a large
and more efficient H-bomb, not a
smaller and more efficient A-bomb.
It will be a weapon of a different
category. All that may be said of it
here is that it is primarily anti-
personnel in destination and effect.”

Murray called for a resumption of
tests in order that we may maintain
parity with the Russians until a suc-
cessful disarmament has been
achieved. He has even suggested
steps which he feels will lead to dis-
armament without damage to na-
tional security. He concludes, “I
know my position has not been a
popular one, Somehow or other the

 

public is obessed by the much too
simple idea that a stoppage of all
tests will put an end to war....I
think this notion is profoundly
false.... My advocacy of resuming
tests is quite reasonable and it looks
both to the national interest and to
the cause of peace.”

Thus the two viewpoints are in
dramatie conflict. We can not ques-
tion the speaker’s honesty, sincerity,
nor the rationality of their approach-
es to the problem. It is in their ap-
parent reasonableness that the
strength of the two arguments is
found. Mr. Murray is reasonable in
presuming that one cannot trust
the Russians and in proceeding from
there to the conclusion that for the
free world’s safety we must maintain
nuclear superiority. Sir Charles’
reasonableness lies in a recognition
of the cold hard fact of the increas-
ing danger of nuclear devastation
and the urgent need to safeguard
humanity from annihilation. You
pays your money and you takes your
choice. What is your choice? What
will be the choice of the new admin-
istration?

Cagers Bow To H-S; Runners 7th; Grapplers Win

Generals Defeat Duke, 24-6

Poor Defense Hurts Generals

By HARRY MEEM

The combination of poor defense
and an off night from the floor cost
the W&L cagers their 15th consecu-
tive loss on the road Saturday, when
they bowed to Hampden-Sydney
72-61 on the Tigers’ boards. The
Generals, who beat the Tigers 79-67
in Doremus Gym earlier this season,
permitted them to hit on 50 per cent
of their shots from the floor, while
cutting the cords at rate of only
30 per cent.

Although the Generals opened
up an early lead, Hampden-Syd-
ney came back to lead 37-32 at the
half and at one time in the sec-
ond half by 19 points before the
Generals cut the final margin to
11 points.

Rodger Fauber and Dave Beale
tied for high scoring honors for the
Generals, with 11 points apiece.

 

Fauber also pulled down 18 rebounds.
Brett Thackston was the only other
General to hit in double figures,
with 10 points. Four Hampden-
Sydney players reach double figures,
topped by Davis’ 25 points.

The Generals sank 23 of 27 free
throws, showing steady improve-
ment on their early season per-
formances. Although pleased with
this Coach Bob McHenry said:

“We pride ourselves on our defense,
but when they hit 50 per cent of
their shots from the floor, it shows
we're missing something. We'll
have to work more on defense to
be ready for Randolph-Macon
here Wednesday night.”

The Yellow Jackets, who defeated
the Generals in Ashland earlier this
season, bring. with them a 12-3
overall record, making them the
leading team in the Little Eight.

 

VMI Relays Are First Test

By HARRY MEEM

Washington and Lee’s_ winter
track team, after a poor showing
in the VMI relays held last Saturday
night, will redouble its efforts in the
next few weeks in an attempt to
improve its record during the balance
of the season.

The Generals were able to mus-
ter only two fourth place finishes
in a meet which was dominated by
VMI and Furman, but Coach Norm
Lord feels that the team has a
good chance to improve.

The W&L entry in the 880 yd. relay
finished fourth, behind VMI, The
Citadel, and Duke. VMI’s winning
time was 1:35.8, while the Generals,
composed of Fox Urquhart, John
Pearson, Skip Essex, and captain Jim
Hickey ran the course in 1:41.5, beat-
ing Wake Forest and Richmond. The
other fourth place was in the high

The freshman basketball team, af-
ter a rather stagnant layoff during
“help” week, trampled Augusta Mil-
itary Academy here, Monday by a
score of 65 to 48.

But all was not well for the Baby
Generals who were noticeably off in
their shooting, ball-handling, and
general overall play. AMA was paced
by Wayne Blaylock and Paul Causby
who combined to pour in 31 of the
losers’ total. Blaylock was high scor-
er for the day with 16. Fred Ridolphi
led the Generals’ scoring with 14
points, with Howard Martin and Stu
Yoffe scoring 10 and 9 respectively.
Going into Monday’s game, Martin
had held an average of almost 21
points per game, while Ridolphi was
averaging a little over 13.

Defensively, the Generals employ-
ed a man-to-man setup, stopping up

jump by freshman Robin Kell, who
cleared the bar at 5’ 6”.

Hickey and Urquhart turned in
times of :6.7 and :6.8 respectively
in the dash trials. John Pearson
had the bad luck to be placed in
the fastest heat of the 70 yard high
hurdles. His time in running third
in this heat would have been good
enough to win the other two heats,
both of which were considerably
slower. Dave Monroe cleared 44
feet in the shot put, which was
won by Duke’s Gesswein with a
throw of slightly over 52 feet.

The Washington and Lee Wrestling
team, riding the crest of a five match
winning streak, entertains the North
Carolina State Wolfpack this Satur-
day at 7:30 p.m. in Doremus Gymna-
sium. Last night, the General grap-
plers battered the Duke Blue Devils,
24-6, before a partisan home crowd.

W&L got off to a quick ten-point
lead by taking pins in the first two
weight classes. Hoke Robinson pin-
ned his opponent in 5:17, while
Dave Montgomery achieved a fall
in 3:23. Ken Greer, Ed Jansen, and
Sandy Mercereau all gained deci-

 

sions to boost the General lead
to 19-0, and freshman Herb Smith
pinned his man in 2:59 to end the
W&L scoring at 24 points.

The Blue Devils averted a shut out
by capturing decisions in the 177
and heavy weight classes. In one of
the most exciting matches of the
evening, Mark Leggett, of ACC foot-
ball fame, edged Jud Babcock 5-3 in
the 177 weight division.

Coach Dick Miller was very pleased
with the team’s overall perform-
ance and felt that “West Virginia
is the only really tough match left
for us.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Moos Friendly With Nixon
(Continued from page 2)

was able to move forward in pur-
suit of a policy of internationalism.

Moos, who will speak here tomor-
row night, can be expected to de-
fend these liberal or Modern Re-
publican views. The general concern
of his discussion will be the Presi-
dency and foreign policy, as this is
related to the present East-West
conflict. He has always been a sup-
porter of the type of legislation in
reciprocal trade as first exempli-
fied by Cordell Hull in 1934. Moos
feels that this type of legislation
will lead to strong international co-
operation.

Moos was a close friend of former
vice-president Richard M. Nixon
and some feel that if Nixon had
been elected President, Moos would
have been maintained in his posi-
tion and possibly would have had a
great deal of influence on Nixon.

Moos’ major interest in political
science has been with the power of
the President and with the shifting
tides of political sentiment. He has
written and collaborated in many
books that are concerned with these
problems. In 1952 he wrote Politics,
Presidents, and Coattails in which he
tried to show that the President was
not as important a force in helping
to bring other candidates from his
party into office during a Presiden-
tial election year as once popularly
believed. His most recent book,
Hats in the Ring, written with Steph-
en Hess, attempts to reveal the in-
tricacies of Presidential politics.

Presently he is working on the
problem of the loss of power on the
part of the President that occurs
between Election Day and Inaugura-
tion Day when a new President is
elected.

 

Thomas’ Views Vindicated
(Continued from page 2)

denounced the imperialist tendencies
of the “Big Three” alliance. The So-
cialists called for a new world order
based on a more equitable distribu-
tion of wealth and said no peace
would be lasting which did not recog-
nize this principle. The Socialist stand
is being vindicated today as experts
on the political problems of under-
developed nations emphasize that
the real battle in the world is not
between democracy and communism,
but between the “have” and the
“have-nots,”

The abbreviated relays, which saw
representatives of nine schools par-
ticipating, acted as good training for
the Generals for the coming State
Meet, to be held on February 18th
at VMI. Unofficially, the Generals
finished seventh in team score.

After the meet, Coach Lord had
this to say: “We were very satis-
fied with the results of our 800 realy
team, and the boys seem to be very
enthusiastic with their performances
at this early stage of the season.”

He went on to add that he would
like to see more members of the
spring track team come out now in
order to begin getting in shape for
the coming season.

istic of a living thing: the will to
live. From this will follow the in-
stinct to reproduce (one agency
spawns another) and to eat (the hap-
less citizenry are the necessary food).

When a state begins to take on
these characteristics, you have, for all
practical purposes, a commune.

So when the President of the
United States calls on the citizenry
to make sacrifices, to support his
plans for increased bureaucracy, to
put more power into his hands be-
cause he is glad to accept it, people
will do well to consider carefully
whither this is leading. The greater
sacrifice would be to refuse to place
those onerous responsibilities in
President Kennedy’s hands and take
them ourselves.

To put your trust in the State is
to surrender to it, to subordinate
yourself to it. Many nations have
tried: Germany, Italy and Russia to
name a few. To be sure, the trains
ran on time; so did the people.

**A GUIDE FOR THE DATELESS’’

With the cost of dating rising higher and higher it is no wonder
that so many of us men are turning to discus throwing. Natur-
ally, we would prefer nuzzling warm coeds to flinging cold
disci, but who’s got that kind of money? Prices being what they
are, the average man today has a simple choice: dating or eating.

Unless the average man happens to be Finster Sigafoos.

Finster came to college with the normal ambition of any
average man: he wanted to find the prettiest coed on campus
and make her his. He looked long and carefully, and at last he
found her—a tall job named Kretchma Inskip, with hair like
beaten gold.

He asked her for a date. She accepted. He appeared at her
sorority house that night, smiling, eager, and carrying a bouquet
of modestly priced flowers.

“Now then,” said Kretchma, tossing the sleazy flora to a
pledge, “where are we going tonight?”

Finster was a man short on cash, but long on ideas. He had
prepared an attractive plan for this evening. ‘How would you
like to go out to the Ag campus and see the milking machine?”
he asked.

“Tek,” she replied.

“Well, what would you like to do?” he asked.

“Come,” said she, “to a funny little place I know just outside
of town.”

And away they went.

The place was Millionaires Roost, a simple country inn made
of solid ivory. It was filled with beautiful ladies in backless
gowns, handsome men in dickeys. Original Rembrandts adorned
the walls. Marlboro trays adorned the cigarette girls. Chained
to each table was a gypsy violinist.

Finster and Kretchma were seated. “I,” said Kretchma to
the waiter, ‘will start with shrimps remoulade. Then I will have
lobster and capon in maderia sauce with asparagus spears. For
dessert I will have melon stuffed with money.”

“And you, Sir?” said the waiter to Finster.

“Just bring me a pack of Marlboros,” replied Finster, “for
if ever a man needed to settle back and enjoy the mild benefi-
cence of choice tobacco and easy-drawing filtration, it is the
shattered hulk you see before you now.”

So, smoking the best of all possible cigarettes, l'inster watched
Kretchma ingest her meal and calculated that every time her
fetching young Adam’s apple rose and fell, he was out another
97¢. Then he took her home.

It was while saying goodnight that Finster got his brilliant
idea. “Listen!” he cried excitedly. “I just had a wonderful
notion. Next time we go out, let’s go Dutch treat!’’

By way of reply, Kretchma slashed him across the face with
her housemother and stormed into the house.

“Well, the heck with her,” said Finster to himself. “She is
just a gold digger and I am well rid of her. I am sure there are
many girls just as beautiful as Kretchma who will understand
the justice of my position. For after all, girls get as much
money from home as men, so what could be more fair than
sharing expenses on a date?”

With good heart and high hopes, Finster began a search for
a girl who would appreciate the equity of Dutch treat, and you
will be pleased to hear that he soon found one—Mary Alice
Hematoma, a lovely three-legged girl with sideburns.

We’re no experts on Dutch treat, but here’s an American treat
we recommend with enthusiasm—Marlboro’s popular new
partner for non-filter smokers—the Philip Morris Commander.
