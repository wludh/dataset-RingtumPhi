$100 Cash Awards Offered

By Journalism Department

The eighth annual competition for
the James Street Awards, for crea-
tive accomplishment in the audio-
visual media, was announced today
by the Department of Journalism
and Communications at Washington
and Lee University.

Awards are given for original
work in radio, motion picture, and
television, and may consist of tapes
of broadcast programs, completed
films, or scripts for any of the me-
dia. Judging is based upon original-
ity, importance of content, under-
standing of the medium, and effec-
tiveness.

Cash awards are given, with a
maximum value of $100. Eligible
are students who have completed
original work as a collateral assign-
ment in one of the media courses
offered by the department, or who
are regularly engaged in extra-
curricular projects of the Communi-
cations Laboratory.

The awards were established by
the late James Street, of Chapel
Hill, N.C., in 1954, to encourage ser-
ious creative work in the audio-
visual media. Awards in the past
have been given to a wide variety
of work, including documentaries,
original dramas and dramatic adap-
tations, experiments with sound, and
narrative and experimental films.

The deadline for the 1961 awards
is May 10.

named by Phi Beta Kappa as the
outstanding member of the sopho-
more class. This award is given an-
nually to the sophomore with the
highest grade average. Vitsky was
initiated into Phi Beta Kappa last
year.

Last semester Vitsky served as
vice president of his fraternity, Zeta
Beta Tau. He was also the managing
editor of the 1960 Calyx.

Vitsky plans to enter Johns Hop-
kins Medical School after gradu-
ation.

The Valedictorian is picked each
year by the faculty. He must be
graduating with a Bachelor of Arts
or a Bachelor of Science degree. The
valedictorian has the responsibility
of giving the major address to the
graduating class at commencement.
Last year’s Valedictorian was Tom
Wieting.

Vann, Hughes, Zinn, Gray
Receive Woodrow Wilson
Grants For Study In 1962

By JULIAN MARKHAM

Washington and Lee’s four re-
cipients of the coveted Woodrow

Wilson Fellowships were announced

today by Dean of the College, Wil-
liam W. Pusey, II.

Receiving the highly competitive
awards are James A. Vann, James
L. Hughes, Lynwood D. Zinn, and
Grayfred B. Gray.

Screened from over 10,000 nomi-
nees in the United States and Cana-
da, these four are among 1,333
Woodrow Wilson Fellows selected
by the Woodrow Wilson National
Foundation. By covering a recipi-
ent’s expenses at the graduate school
of his choice, the Woodrow Wilson
Fellowships aim at
“highly qualified and highly moti-
vated” undergraduates to pursue col-
lege teaching as a career.

James Vann, a Phi Psi senior from
Birmingham, Ala., was president of
his junior class, and is currently
president of the Dance Board, an
Executive Committeeman, and pres-
ident of the Concert Guild, and a
member of ODK. Vann, a Phi Beta
Kappa, expects to continue his study
of history under the fellowship.

Editor of the Shenandoah, David
Zinn will concentrate his study in
anthropology. Zinn is a philosophy
major from Clarksburg, W. Va.

James Hughes, a math major from
Richmond, Va., is a member of Phi
Eta Sigma and Phi Beta Kappa.
In graduate school Hughes will con-
tinue his study of mathematics.

Publisher of “Protest,” Grayfred
Gray is a member of the debate
team, the Troubadours, and a con-
tributor to the Southern Collegian.
Gray, also a member of Phi Eta Sig-
ma and Phi Beta Kappa, expects to
continue his study of philosophy in
graduate school.

The Woodrow Wilson National
Fellowship Foundation was estab-
lished in 1946. In its current budget,
a total of $3,000,000 will be spent
for the 1961-62 fellowships alone.
Noting a 21 percent increase in ap-
plications over the previous year,
the foundation’s national director,
Dr. Hans Rosenhaupt, believes that
a larger number of students are con-
sidering teaching as a “prestige”
eareer despite opportunities to earn
more in other fields.

Faure ‘Requiem’ Featured Sunday

In Joint Concert

By ROGER PAINE

The Longwood College Choir and
the Washington and Lee Glee Club
will open the spring musical season
this Sunday, March 19, with a joint
concert at the Lexington Presby-
terian Church. The two choral
groups will sing Faure’s “Requiem”
beginning at 4:30 Sunday afternoon.

Accompanying the two clubs will
be a 19-piece chamber orchestra
with brass, strings and woodwinds.
Mr. Robert Stewart of W&L will
conduct the “Requiem,” and Dr.
John Molnar of Longwood will con-
duct the two clubs in three selec-
tions from Handel’s “Messiah.” They
will do the “Hallelujah Chorus,”
“Worthy Is the Lamb,” and the final

“Amen.”

“Requiem” will be fully as much
a landmark in the annals of the
W&L Glee Club was Haydn’s
“The Seasons,” which was done
last year with the Hollins College
Choir. “Requiem” combines
smoothly flowing passages with
alternate brisk movements to pro-
duce one of the most famous musi-
cal compositions ever written.

Tomorrow afternoon the Glee
Club will leave the campus shortly
after lunch for a rehearsal at Long-
wood. After the concert is given
here in Lexington this Sunday, it
will be repeated for the benefit of

Mankind Seen As Self-Centered

By TOM LYBASS

Man’s “collective self-centered-
ness” may lead the human race to
commit mass suicide unless its search
for spiritual truth brings order out
of the chaos in world history. Only
when higher religions solve this

 

problem, “will we know whether
history makes sense.”

So Dr. Arnold Toynbee answered
the question, “Does History Make
Sense?” in a speech delivered to
an audience of 1,000 packed in Dore-
mus Gymnasium last Friday night.

Dr. Arnold Toynbee speaks before an estimated crowd of 1,000 students,
faculty members and visiting guests at his Friday night lecture at Doremus

 

Gymnasium,

—Photo by Young

Toynbee traced the three “strands”
of historical development—political,
technolgical, and spiritual. His con-
clusions were that “political history
makes no sense,” technological his-
tory has revealed “man’s most brill-
liant success” and spiritual history
shows “an increase in spiritual grace
that offers a possible solution to
the present position of man.”

“Technology and politics cannot be
separated,” the noted British phil-
osopher said. “The interplay has
culminated in the most senseless
episode to date.”

Deploring the use of the new found
powers of the atom for warfare, Dr.
Toynbee warned, “Mass suicide will
be within our power day after to-
morrow, if not now!” Man’s pri-
mary objective today is survival, but
“it is a negative objective.”

Toynbee called self-centeredness
and the worship of man’s “collective
power” the chief evils of the pres-
ent world. “Man’s conquest of na-
ture has led to worship of man’s
collective power, instead of a spirit-
ual power formerly thought to have
been manifested in nature.”

“In modern times this self-worship
has led to communism, fascism, and
totalitarianism,” he said. “This type
of self-worship is the religion of
fully 90 per cent of mankind.”

Toynbee also criticized Christiani-
ty for manifesting this same self-
centeredness. By claiming “that one
of the higher religions has a com-
plete claim to truth,” Christianity
has committed the arch-sin of self-
centeredness which is the chief
fault of today’s religion, he said.

“Of all higher religions,” the 71-
year-old scholar added, “only Hin-
duism has acknowledged that it is
not the only embodiment of spiritual
reality.”

“Throughout human history, man
has believed that there is something
that transcends our human na-
ture....man’s interpretation of this
reality has differed widely, and
through these conceptions have
seemed different to us, they may be
only different aspects of some ulti-
mate reality.”

 

 

—®has been academically prominent on

the campus for several years. Begin-
ning with his election to Phi Eta
Sigma in his freshman year, con-
tinuing with Dean’s List and Honor
Roll grades, and climaxing in his
recent election to Phi Beta Kappa
as the only junior this year who re-
ceived that distinction, he has dem-
onstrated his ability to do a superior
job. He served last year as a man-
aging editor of the Calyx to add to
his practical experience. In addi-
tion to these activities, Goldstein
is a member of Alpha Epsilon Del-
ta, honorary pre-med fraternity, and
has served as secretary of both the
Library Committee and Zeta Beta
Tau.

Robin Wood, an SAE junior from
Lynchburg, Va., has also been active
in Washington and Lee affairs.
While playing varsity football and
baseball, he has been able to main-
tain Dean’s List standing and now
has an overall 1.8 grade-point-ra-
tio. He is an IFC representative, and
is presently that organization’s so-
cial chairman. Like Goldstein, he has
participated in his fraternity’s af-
fairs by serving as its secretary.
Further, he is active in the Trouba-
dours and the SWMSFC musical.

Goldstein has announced the fol-
lowing tentative appointments for
members of his staff: assistant edi-
tor, Steve Galef; managing editors,
Bob Payne and Herb Salomon; ad-
ministration editor, John Poyner;
classes editor, Cotton Rawls; organ-
ization editors, Randy Cole and Buck
Ogilvie; feature editor, Pete Agelas-
to; fraternities editor, John Madison;
sports editors, Phil Sharp, Syd But-
ler, and Barry Greene.

At the same time, Wood announc-
ed that Danny Markstein would as-
sist him in handling the in-town
advertising and that Bill Broadman
would handle the out-of-town ad-
vertising.

Both Goldstein and Wood an-
nounced enthusiastically that they
were very pleased to have received
their positions and that they hope to
give the university a representative
yearbook.

Important Letter

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

Two weeks ago Ed Webster wrote
a column which soundly criticized
the Southern Collegian. Some of
what he said is, unfortunately, the
truth. But I believe he has mis-
construed the purpose of The Col-
legian and has accused it of some-
thing which is hardly limited to the
Collegian alone.

Webster claimed that The Col-
legian has degenerated from its past
years. This is, in some ways, a just
criticism, but The Collegian’s purpose
as a college humor magazine is still
being carried out quite adequately,
although the staff is reduced from
what it was five years ago.

The student apathy which has af-
fected The Collegian is something
which goes far deeper than simply
lack of good satirists at W&L. Yes-
terday when the Publications Board
held interviews for the positions of
Editor and Business Manager of the
Calyx, there were only two ap-
plicants—those two were elect-
ed to the positions. Both editions of
the Ring-tum Phi had carried an-
nouncements about the dates of the
interviews for the three weeks pre-
vious to the interview date.

But whether Webster was using
The Collegian as his whipping boy
or not is really not important. The
real question lies not with what is
right or wrong with The Southern

‘Heads Or Tails’

The Student War Memorial Scholarship Fund Committee
will sponsor the annual spring musical show with the hope of
raising a substantial sum of money for the purpose of grant-
ing additional scholarship aid to needy applicants to Wash-
ington and Lee. This year’s show promises to be the best
that has been produced on our campus.

The show, which is entitled Heads or Tails, is directed by
Steve Danzansky, the director of last year’s musical, The Can-
non’s Mouth which was outstanding enough to merit favorable
remarks from Richard Coe of the Washington Post. Danzansky
has done an excellent job in writing both the script and the mu-
sic. The theme of the show is taken from Aristophanes’ Lysis
trata.

The Committee has engaged a professional arranger, Crane
Calder, who has worked on Broadway with Rodgers and Ham-
merstein, to arrange Danzansky’s melody for voice, orchestra
and piano. The addition of this professional touch should in-
crease the quality of the production.

This year’s female cast is made up of some fifteen girls
from Sweet Briar College. These girls are transported to the
WeL campus four times weekly for rehearsals in the old
Co-op. Members of the Committee take four turns each in
the car pool. In all, there will be some 125 people involved
in the production of the show.

Tickets for the show, which runs from Monday, April 10
through Saturday, April 15 (the week before and including
Spring Dances) have been on sale for one week. They have
been sold by members of the Committee in the lobby of Wash-
ington Hall, in the freshman dormitory, and in the fraternity
houses. At present, they are on sale in the Co-op. Attempts
will be made to sell tickets to the faculty and the townspeople.

Until spring vacation, the tickets will be sold for $2.00
per seat. Beginning April 3, the price will be increased by fifty
cents. The house managers have agreed to allow the students
to charge the tickets on their house bills. The above provisions
were made to increase the early sale of tickets.

We understand that the Committee has high hopes of
putting the show on the road the week after its stand in Lex-
ington. As far as we can gather, nothing final has been done
along these lines, and any decision depends upon the arrange-
ments that can be made in the Lynchburg-Roanoke-Richmond
area for theater space, ticket sales, etc. The profits from such
a trip would certainly warrant the extra work and inconvience
to both the cast and the Committee. Both groups have agreed
to make the necessary sacrifices.

The administration at Sweet Briar has been most coopera-
tive in allowing their girls to participate in the show, and Dan-
zansky has been able to select an experienced and talented cast
for his production. The girls leave the Date House at Sweet
Briar at 6:00 each evening and return at midnight. It is evi-
dent that participation in the show requires no small sacrifice
on their part.

The amount of time and effort which goes into a show of
this sort is immeasurable. The expenses are unusually large es-
pecially when the size of the theater and the available audience
is considered. The quality of the cast is excellent. The prepara-
tion has been adequate. The success depends largely upon the
support the show receives from the student body.

Of the 125 persons involved in the production, over one
hundred are directly connected with the W&L community.
The orchestra, headed by Gene Johnson and made up of stu-
dents from W&L and Sweet Briar, is experienced and well
directed. The participation in the nightly rehearsals by the
wives of students and law students, who in some cases are forced
to hire babysitters during rehearsal hours, would indicate that
the show is drawing talent from all segments of the student
body.

The SWMSFC is an organization made up of students
who have expressed a desire to aid other less fortunate students
to attend our university. These boys, under the capable leader-
ship of President David Lefkowitz, have done all that is in their
power to make this year’s show a financial success.

The total number of seats in the Troubadour Theat-
er for all performances is considerably less than the total
number of students attending Washington and Lee. In
view of this fact, we feel that the Committee should
have no trouble filling the theater for the seven perfor-
ances. The director, the cast, and the Committee deserve
the support of every member of the college community.
They will offer the type of show that will warrant this

support.

A Fable:
The Evolution
Of GRIPE

By STEVE HENRY

Once upon a time there was a
little boy named Brownfred Brown
who grew up and went to a liberal
arts college where he lived in a
Bohemian apartment over a run-
down movie theatre.

Brownfred, you see, was a very
arty type.

He did not like to shave. He did
not particulary like clean clothes.
He did not like people.

“Most people stink,” growled
Brownfred one afternoon in his pad
while a campus reporter cringed in
the corner.

In short, Brownfred did not like
much at all.

Except, that is, he liked to gripe.
He griped about everything. He
griped about institutions, people,
teachers, names, systems. You name
it, Brownfred griped about it.

The only trouble was that people
got tired of hearing Brownfred’s
head rattle. Whenever he began talk-
ing, his audience would somehow
find an excuse to leave.

“Take a dive, Brownfred,” they
would say.

Now all this would have discour-
aged an ordinary man, but Brown-
fred was far from normal.

“They are all wrong and I am
right,” he growled, and left school.
He stayed away for maybe a year,
developing a literary style. Then he
returned.

“Now my pen will talk for me,”
said Brown. “I’ve seen a lot of life
and need to talk about what I don’t
like.”

The first issue of GRIPE, a week-
ly dump-sheet, appeared shortly af-
terward.

“I am devoted to causes,” penned
Brown, but failed to mention any of
them specifically. “I am opposed to
conformity. I hate apathy. I despise
oppressors. I love freedom.”

“I am going to shock this student
body into action.”

For 14 weeks, he religiously turned
out an issue of GRIPE. He attacked
everything—people, customs, organi-
zations. He proposed changes. He
was radical, liberal, the symbol of
freedom.

Then he sat back and waited for
any sign or movement among the
student body which might indicate
what he called a “healthy trend.”

“Take a dive, Brownfred,” laughed
the student body, all except a few
who thought maybe Brown had some
points to make but wasn’t exactly
sure what the points were.

The trouble was that no one could
decide whether Brownfred had any-
thing to say or whether he was just
griping as usual.

Besides, by the time the reader
waded through Brown’s endless pla-
titudes directed against the univer-
sity, he was too worn out and dis-
gusted to worry about who was right
or wrong.

To make a long story short, there
was no rebellion, no change, no
nothing. The school, and it was a
very good one to start with, scorned
Brownfred just as he had tried to
scorn it.

Which disturbed Brownfred great-
ly, because he was a very sensitive
boy and after all did believe in what
he was doing.

He lapsed into a state of melan-
choly, and for long periods would
not come out of his room except at
night when he would walk up and
down the streets of town reciting
“The World Is Too Much With Us.”

Brownfred, for all practical pur-
poses, was a broken spirit.

And then it happened. Brownfred
fell in love, fell in love with a very
proper girl from Upper Montclair,
New Jersey, whose father dabbled
in the stock market and did not care
for changes at all.

So Brownfred cleaned up _ his
apartment and shaved and took a
bath and courted the girl, and final-
ly they were married.

Now Brownfred is very happy in-
deed. He has a good job with his
father-in-law’s firm, and will prob-
ably be a junior partner by June.
He and his wife and in-laws are get-
ting along well.

One day Brownfred dug up some
old copies of GRIPE, which he had
locked away after he had met his
wife.

“What tripe!” laughed Brownfred.
“How could I have ever written
this? How could I have believed that
I could change the world?” And he
and his wife had a good laugh be-
fore dinner.

Secretly though, Brownfred would
still like to swim the Hellespont.

Honor System Depends On Self-Control,
Student Body Meetings Are Unnecessary

By BILL ROBERTS

The editor(s) of “Protest” have
pointed out quite a few things wrong
with Washington and Lee, despite
their disgustingly self-conscious and
defensive manner.

They believe firmly that answers
can be found to problems and that
answers are worth looking for. They
are unwilling to accept our predom-
inate theme—“what is is right.”

We disagree with Mr. Gray’s pro-
gram to make the honor system spe-
cific but we are impressed with his
efforts to make the Code a meaning-
ful part of Washington and Lee life.
There is a great deal of uncertainty
among the student body about what
is honorable and what is not. The

 

Executive Committee has a positive
responsibility to help the student
body formulate its own concept of
honor.

We think that the flexibility of the
honor system created by leaving its
interpretation to each student gen-
eration is one of the greatest bene-
fits of the system at Washington and
Lee. But the Executive Committee
confines its role a great deal when
it will only interpret the system as
a judicial body, passing on some-
one’s privilege to be a Washington
and Lee man.

There are great many practices,
not at all uncommon, which one is
likely to question as wholly “honor-
able.” We cannot lie (except to the

 

A Salute To Unsung Heroes

Of Halls, Lawns

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

In the course of our busy activity
on campus, drinking deep at the
fountain of knowledge, we sometimes
tend to forget (or even ignore) those
humble souls who make our cere-
bral life possible by performing those
menial tasks necessary to keep even
such a spiritual institution as ours
running. These men might well be
termed “the unsung heroes of Wash-
ington and Lee.”

For example, there is our splendid
janitorial staff. Toiling faithfully,
without regard to time or personal
gain, they exemplify a spirit of sac-
rifice well in tune with the ideals of
this university. This they do so that
we scholars may carry on our quest
for learning unfettered by mundane
concerns. Who, having once seen
these gallant men going about their
daily tasks can fail to be stirred by
this devotion to duty?

But the mere quantity of work
these men do is not what merits
this praise—any drudge can work
hard—it is the meticulous care and
attention to the least detail that
merits it. Of these few souls it may
be truly said that they understood
the meaning of the saying “If it’s
worth doing, it’s worth doing well.”

 

And Counters

Our janitors are not the only un-
recognized toilers in this academic
vineyard. There is also that brave
little band in charge of the grounds
of the university. One has only to
gaze on the lush greensward (which
would excite envy in the ancient
English earl) to appreciate the ir-
replaceable service the ground crew
renders us.

In the fall they can be seen en-
gaged in the never-ending task of
raking and collecting leaves. Whole
platoons of them, cheerfully clean-
ing up Nature’s rubbish. Few people
realize that if these leaves were al-
lowed to accumulate in great drifts
about the campus, careless scholars,
immersed in higher thought, might
stumble and suffocate in these piles
of leaves, never to be seen again
until the Spring Thaw.

While it is true that these men
disappear during the winter, it is not
because they are faithless; it is simp-
ly because of the toll that their hard
physical labor in the fall has taken
on them. But rest assured that
wherever they go, they think only of
us and their return in the spring.

And in the spring they do return,
to spread hay on the grass, punch

‘Protest’ Convention Is Plausible,

But Is Majority Worthy Of Trust?

By ED WEBSTER

For the next month, the honor
system will probably become a topic
of intense—and, I hope, construc-
tive—debate.

Debate is not new to the honor
system, for the Executive Committee
itself has already considered—in
private — several proposals for
changing it. However, not even the
EC has been able to reach agreement
on some aspects of the system.

Last Friday, Grayfred Gray, the
editor of “Protest,” climaxed four
weeks of indictments of the present
system with a detailed program for
revising it. He plans to start bring-
ing his proposals to a vote after
April 10. In order to do this, he’ll
probably have to present a petition
bearing 50 signatures.

Judging from some student reac-
tion which I have observed, 50 op-
ponents of the present system won’t
be hard to find. But whichever side
wins, let it win by a vigorous and
open defense of its principles, well
documented by factual evidence.

Gray charges that the main
faults of the present system are its
uncertainties; students cannot al-

 

Paine’s Pearls

By ROGER PAINE

If the character of the cast mem-
bers for Steve Danzansky’s new mu-
sical is any indication, the show
should be worthwhile. Rumor has it
that Debra Doherty, a Sweet Briar
girl who plays the rather masculine
female lead as Lysistrata has re-
ceived a special request from the
Department of the Navy to become
a Drill Instructor for the Women’s
Marine Corps.

punishment. Gray’s proposals con-
tain no guarantee that they would
be mitigated.

Quadrennial student conventions
for the purpose of updating the list
of dishonorable offenses, as Gary
proposes, seem plausible at first
glance. The determining factor in
such conventions would presumably
be a veto of the majority. But is the
majority always reliable in matters
of honor? Might the majority pos-
sibly be more inclined to vote in
favor of convenience?

Perhaps a better way of defining
the “public opinion of the student
generation involved” would be to in-
terpret this as meaning the best
opinion—for instance, the E.C.. It is
because they are men of above-aver-
erage intelligence and understanding
that the members of the E.C. have
been elected by their fellow students.

The students thus have given the
E.C. the right to judge each case
on its merits. Let us not shackle
this body with detailed rules which
might lead to unjust convictions or
undeserved acquittals. The only
necessary rule is a familiar one:
no W&L man, while engaged in
any college activity, shall lie, cheat
or steal.

Some further points may be briefly
treated:

1. Gray suggests that the accused
should be informed of the specific
charges against him. This is only
fair. I would also suggest that the
charge be made in writing, and that
the prosecution be confined to the
proof of this charge.

2. Gray suggests that the defen-
dant be given enough time to pre-
pare his case. (Even at VMI the
defendant is given 24 hours.) Per-
haps this pre-trial work could be
done through a defense counsel,
chosen from the E.C. by the accused.

3. The present rules provide that a
two-thirds vote of the E.C. shall be
sufficient to convict. Disagreement
by the other one-third of the E.C.,
however, implies that the guilt has
not been established beyond a
reasonable doubt. A unanimous vote
should be required.

 

ABC Store salesmen). We are strict-
ly honest in all our business dealings
(except those having to do with
telephones). We do not steal (ex-
cept liquor, raincoats, and “trophies”
from U.Va., Sweet Briar, the state
highway department, etc.) We do not
cheat (except that we are allowed to
skip an occasional footnote).

There are many men here who
would like to see these practices
stop. But it would be ridiculous to
turn another man in for any of them.
He would in all probability be asked
to leave school for an offense which
was condoned by most of his fellow
students, judging by their reluctance
to turn in the numerous others who
were equally guilty.

The Role of the EC

Is this because the Executive Com-
mittee’s honor is higher than that of
the student body at large? In all
probability it is. But more important,
the Executive Committee must ad-
minister the honor system—they are
constantly aware of the stern de-
mands honor makes on a man. Thus
they judge an action on the basis of
the high standards of honor laid
down and exemplified by General
Lee as president of this university.
The rest of the student body is more
lax—if they were not lax in their de-
votion to honor they would not have
allowed the situation Mr. Gray is
worried about to arise .

But the situation exists and some-
thing must be done about it. Nothing
will be accomplished by setting up
a convention to draft a set of rules
for honorable behavior. Honor is
based in the heart of the individual.
It ceases to be honor when it be-
comes common law.

Solution Is Personal

The answer seems to be rather
simple. Many of us have come from
schools and societies in which there
is little or no respect for a concept
of honor. We have continued to
hold and practice the values of those
groups at Washington and Lee as far
as seemed possible. We accept and
approve the current opinion when
we came here that the more flagrant
examples of lying, cheating, and
stealing were dishonorable. But we
never stopped to re-evaluate the
small matters of honor. We prob-
ably did not commit a breach of
honor of any kind ourselves but we
were inclined to laugh off the fra-
ternity brother who stole smudge
pots from the big hole in the road to
Buena Vista, or the one who passed
a bad check deliberately. That was
his business, not ours.

The crime is not that we didn’t
turn him in to the EC, but that we
didn’t stop and ask him immediately,
“Do you think this action becomes
a Washington and Lee man and a
gentleman?” The odds are 1000-1 he
wouldn’t think so.

Honor System at Stake

But these little things have been
going on for some time now. A
concerned and vocal interest in the
Honor System by the student body
is desperately needed to save it from
the indifference which has killed it
at schools like William and Mary.
All we have to do is ask ourselves
the simple question “Is this honor-
able?” before we do something which
might include lying, cheating, or
stealing. If anyone stops asking this
question, he is no credit to Wash-
ington and Lee. If more than a very
few of us stop asking the question,
the Honor System is dead. In such a
case it would be wise to do Generals
Lee and Washington the credit of
renaming this university and replace
them with a chosen unscrupulous
businessman and some outstanding
political charlatan.

Track Season Starts Thurs.

With the first track meet coming
up tomorrow, Coach Lord is keep-
ing his fingers crossed. Although the
squad had an excellent season last
year, there has been a sparse turn-
out this spring and many of the
places will have to be filled by
freshmen. Fortunately there seem to
be quite a few talented freshmen,
among them Skip Essex, Robin Kell,
Spence McEvoy, Henry Sackett,
Dave and Norm Youngblood.

Mike Shank, a veteran, will con-
tinue to hold down the number one
spot in both the one and two mile
runs. Shank will be doing his best
to break 4:40 in the mile. Jim Hick-
ey, this year’s captain, ran the 100

 

in 9.9 last year and hopes to do
even better this year. Joining Hick-
ey in the dashes will be Sackett and
Britt. Ken Kowalski and Mickey
Walker are expected to hold their
own in the javelin while Tom Ed-
wards is again looking well in the
broad jump.

The hurdles are somewhat of a
question mark with Ed Croft and
Ashley Wiltshire likely prospects.
Skip Essex, who did well during
the indoor season will probably hold
down the 440, but he may have
stiff competition from Norm Young-
blood in the 880. Robin Kell will
likely do well in the broad jump
while Cruger and Dave Monroe will

be out to break 45 feet in the shot
put.

Maynard Wins Honors At Princeton Meet

Elliott Maynard, Washington and
Lee’s ace swimmer, returned from
the East Coast Intercollegiate meet
held last weekend with second and
sixth places in the 100 yard and
200 yard breast stroke, respectively.

The meet which is held every year
was at Princeton this year and over
40 schools participated in the event.
All of the schools were from the
East coast including the Ivy League
schools.

Maynard had a 2:24 in the quali-
fying round for the 200 yard and a
1:046 in the 100 yard qualifying
round.

Lacrosse Team Prepares
For Md., English Teams

By BARRY GREENE

“The English will be tough, and
Maryland will be tougher,” were
the words of lacrosse coach Mc-
Henry as he expressed his views on
the opening lacrosse games. A strong
Maryland squad will play here on
March 22, and the English All-Stars
invade Lexington on the 23rd.

Coach McHenry feels that the
Maryland team is a smart, tough
club with a lot of experience. Most
of this experience can be attributed
to the fact that Maryland gets a lot
of Baltimore boys, and the Balti-
more boys seem to be the ones with
the most previous experience. How-
ever, in the words of McHenry, “we
like Baltimore boys, but we like
athletes more.” McHenry feels that
we have a hustling, spirited ball club
and that we’ve not only got some
experience, but the team also pos-
sesses many prize football players
such as Steve Suttle, Terry Fohs,
and Charlie Gummey who are real
assets because of their love for con-
tact.

On March 23 the Oxford-Cam-
bridge University lacrosse team
will open an _ eleven-game_ tour
against United States Intercollegiate
Lacrosse Association Teams, when
they take the field against the Gen-
erals. The visitors will play under
United States Collegiate lacrosse
rules instead of English rules. To
this coach McHenry added, “the
English will be a little handicapped
by the change of rules, but we'll
be handicapped by playing Maryland
the day before. It should be interest-
ing to watch.

This will be the first visit of an
Oxford-Cambridge squad to the
United States in thirty years. How-
ever, Rensselaer Polytechnic Insti-
tute, the University of Virginia,
Washington and Lee, and Johns
Hopkins have made trips to England
in the past twelve years.

Last week the Generals were beat-
en by the University of Virginia

lacrosse team in a scrimmage by
the score of 14 to 3. The coach is
not discouraged though. He feels
that the game was a big help, and
that we learned a lot. McHenry
added, “They have a lot of Balti-
more boys, therefore, they have twice
as much experience. However, from
now until the end of the season
Virginia will improve a little, and
we will improve a lot.”

So far the players who have
played the most have been attack-
men Les Peard, Ray Miller, Ray
Gordon, and Jimmy Powers; de-
fensemen Barton Mitchell, co-cap-
tain John Dinkel, and Danny Reed;
and two units of mid-fielders,
Charlie Gummey, co-captain Hunt-
er Tracht, and Terry Fohs in one un-
it; Randy Wooton, Steve Stull, Steve
Suttle, and Billy Spenser-Strong
on the other unit. The goalies have
been Pete Noonan and Herb Tinley.
Upcoming freshmen include Pete
Noonan, Jim Powers, John Mc-
Daniel, and Ed Jansen.

As for the out look, Coach Mc-
Henry says, “Injury-wise we’ve been
real lucky; with the exception of
Jerry Hyatt’s knee injury and a few
bumps and bruises, the team is in
good shape. Maryland and the Eng-
lish will be really tough; but we’ve
been lucky with the weather. Last
year at this time we had only been
outside once; so far we’ve been out
twelve times. The boys are improv-
ing, and we'll give them a good
fight.”

There will be a Student War Me-
morial Scholarship Fund Committee
meeting tonight at 7 in the Student

Letter Suggests
Faculty’s Team
Challenge PiKA

Editor
The Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

This is a sort of “set the record
straight” letter regarding intramural
handball. A recent R-t P account
mentioned how the Phi Psi’s had
won the title “the past few years.”
Indeed, the Phi Psi’s did win last
year, but the year before a faculty
team swept aside all opposition,
7-0 in team matches and 34-1 in
individual matches, and copped the
trophy. Of course, everyone recalls
that the student Intramural leaders
then said, in effect, “Well, if you’re
going to win when you compete, then
you just can’t compete!” So, the
faculty was ruled ineligible, just
when we’d managed to recruit a
promising newcomer by the name
of Cole. Anyhow, I’m told that the
IM authorities relented, made us
eligible again this year, but then
neglected to inform our leader when
the competition would start. Thus,
we missed out again, although that
is neither here nor there as far as
our individual players are concerned.
We found year before last that there
really isn’t much sport in games that
are won by 21 service aces.

The difficulty in deciding the
championship this year can mean
one of two things: 1) the competi-
tion is getting better and more
evenly balanced among the students,
or 2) the Phi Psi’s have slipped ter-
ribly and nobody, but nobody, is
any good among the students’ team-
wise, that is.

It is recalled that lasts year in a
fit of everconfidence, the champion

Letters To The Editor

(Continued from page 3)

Phi Psi’s challenged the faculty
team to a sort of “bowl” match, if
you will. Actually, only three match-
es were played—two singles and the
doubles—with the score 3-0 for the
faculty, the other two singles match-
es were never scheduled.

I don’t suppose the champion PiKA
team would be interested in any
post-season competition. Should
their recent triumphs carry them to
the same dizzy heights of vainglory,
perhaps a match could be arranged.
However, as a safeguard against
wasting valuable faculty time, it
might be prudent to suggest a match
between the PiKA No. 1 man and
the faculty’s No. 6 man. In the un-
likely event of a PiKA win here,
then perhaps a team face-off
wouldn’t prove too much of a mis-
match. Or better still, perhaps an
intramural all-star squad might en-
gage the faculty team. Of course,
all of this is entirely up to the
students. It certainly isn’t the faculty
team’s wish to tarnish in any way
the glitter of a student team’s claim
to being “school champs.”

Modestly yours,

F. Arthur Parsons
Faculty Team Manager

Collegian, but what has happened to
the enthusiasm that certainly should
be inherent in a student body such
as the one at Washington and Lee.
This apathy seems to pervade the
entire student body.

I would suggest, however, that to
condemn The Collegian would be a
big mistake. It remains just as es-
sential a publication as either the
Ring-tum Phi or the Calyx. A well-
written satire in The Collegian can
be ten times more effective than a
hundred editorials in the Ring-tum
Phi on the same subject.

The Collegian should be a twen-
tieth century parellel to Addison
and Steele’s Spectator, and with
eareful thought and consideration,
its articles could be most effective
in pointing out some of the things
about Washington and Lee that,
from the students’ point of view,
might be improved. The Spectator
became so respected that it could
call all men fools and have them
agree. The Collegian certainly has
a few beams to remove before it
starts picking out the motes around
W&L, but this is no reason to con-
demn it. I would suggest that Webs-
ter began throwing stones without
sufficient forethought.

Apathy on campus is easy to talk
about; replacing it with enthusiasm
will require perservance and dedi-
cation. But it can be done, and shall
be done. The complexion of The
Collegian is already changing, just
as surely as is the complexion of the
entire University. We have the po-
tential—what we do not need is the
seeming overabundance of self-
styled prophets of doom.

Sincerely yours,

Roger Paine

This Sunday’s concert marks only
the beginning of what will be the
most active spring season in the
Glee Club’s history. After the Long-
wood concerts, the club will sing
a full program with the Westhamp-
ton College Choir later on in the
spring. This program will be pre-
sented both at W&L in the Dore-
mus Gymnasium and at Richmond.

A spring tour which will cul-
minate with an informal concert
for Washington and Lee alumni in
and around Wilmington, Del., to be
given on May 3, will complete the
Glee Club’s schedule. The alumni
in Wilmington have been planning
this concert for over a year, and
have prepared a cocktail party for
the club after the concert.

In addition to numerous live con-
certs, the Glee Club is now record-
ing a 12-inch long playing album
featuring Christmas carols. Includ-
ed with these carols will be some
of the most outstanding numbers
from the club’s all new 1961 reper-
toire, which will be presented to the
school at the spring concert with

Of Paine’s Pearls

As the year progressed, there have
been a surprisingly large number of
gimps on this campus (not the least
of which was the venerable editor of
this edition and it is this author’s
contention that they are worthless,

passing out accolades, forget those
in the co-op, whose motto and stand-
ard is “service with a smile,” and
whose courtesy is matched only by
their promptitude and cheerfulness.
In their efforts to ease the students’
path to learning, they eagerly re-
lieve him of all mundane concerns
such as time and money.

When faced with this sterling de-
votion to duty, words nearly fail us,
and we can only say, with a suspi-
cious hint of moistness in our eyes
and a catch in our throat, “Well
done, thou good and faithful ser-
vant.”
