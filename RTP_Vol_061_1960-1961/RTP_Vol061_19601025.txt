Luncheon, Lectures, Football
Make Weekend ‘Great Success’

By JOHN KIRKLEY

The sixth ennual Washington and
Lee Parents’ Weekend was held on
Oct. 21-23. A total of 931 parents
representing 29 stetes and the District
of Columbia made this Parents’
Weekend the largest in the history of
the school. Dr. E. B. Hamer, chair-
man of the Parents’ Weekend Com-
mittee, termed the weekend “a great
success.”

Parents and guests began to arrive
Thursday evening, just as the beau-
tiful Virginia Indian Summer was
being seasoned with a few wintry
blasts. Registration began early Fri-
day morning in Washington Hall.

Registration continued Friday
afternoon, while those parents who
had already registered had ap-
pointments with various members
of the faculty and administration.
The Parents’ Advisory Council also
met Friday afternoon in the Con-
ference Room of the Letitia Pate
Evans Dining Hall. The Council,
presided over by Chairman L. P.
Nelson, Jr., of Culpeper, Va., was
addressed by the President of the
University.

Dr. Cole reported on various de-
velopments which have occurred
during the past year. He discussed
the financial aid program, the recent-
ly established research fund for un-
dergraduates and faculty, and the
new science facilities which are to
be completed before the fall of 1962.
He also mentioned the high calibre
of the student body, and explained
the innovations in the campus motor
vehicle regulations, largely a pro-
duct of this same Council.

Following Dr. Cole’s talk were a
discussion period and the election
of next year’s officers. Mr. Richard
T. Edwards (class of ’35) of Roa-
noke, Va., is the chairman for 1960-
61.

The

Council is an organization

designed to promote understanding |

between the parents and the Univer-
sity and to serve the University in
an advisory capacity.

 

Openings Collegian Ready;
Sweet Briar Featured

The Openings issue of the South-
ern Collegian will be available for
the student body on Oct. 28.

As in the past, the Southern Col-
legian, which is published four times
a year, will reflect the humorous
side of Washington and Lee’s cam-
pus activity through the use of
satire, caricatures and other forms
of high humor.

Additional features of the cur-
rent Collegian will include a guide
to the Virginia girl’s schools, an
article on the Commons, and the
beauty section, which will feature
Sweet Briar.

The staff of this year’s Collegian
is headed by Hugo Hoogenboom,
editor; Ken Beale, managing edi-
tor; Bill MeCardell, business man-
ager; and Bill Young, photography
editor.

Hoogenboom stated that positions
are still open on the staff for any-
one interested in working for the
Collegian.

 

Formerly, membership has been
limited to a representative number
of parents with boys in each class
and from a variety of geographical
hackgrounds. This year, however,
three students also attended the
meetings: Dave Lefkowitz, Don
Partington, and Louis Nelson.

Fridsy evening there were two
discussions and a lecture which the
parents could attend. Mr. Reigel and
Mr. Crenshaw spoke on “Political
Campaigning—Then and Now.” This
group met in Lee Chapel under the
direction of Don Rhinesmith. Jim
Vann presided over a discussion of
“Educational Perspectives at Home
and Abroad”; Dr. Fishwick and Dr.
Myers were the speakers. Dr. Jun-
kin conducted a lecture and paint-
ing demonstration in the auditorium
of duPont Hall on the topic “Realism
vs. Cubism.” He was assisted by Don
Thalacker and Norbert Irvine.

The scheduled events for Friday
concluded with a coffee given for
parents and their sons at the resi-
dence of Dr. and Mrs. Cole.

Saturday morning, parents had
further appointments with faculty
members and other school of-
ficals. Donald H. Partington, the
President of the Student Service
Society, and other members of the
SSS conducted campus tours for
the parents.

At 11:00 am. there was an assem-
bly of parents in the Doremus Gym-
nasium. This “Report to Parents”
included short talks by Warren

Hayner Talks
Tonight at 7:00

Dr. Paul Hayner, Associate Pro-
fessor of Philosophy, will conduct
a discussion on Existentialism tonight
at seven o’clock in the Student Union.
This discussion is a preliminary to
the lecture on that subject to be de-
livered by Dr. Nels Ferre on Nov.
10 during Religious Emphasis Week.

A student of men prominent in the
field, such as Dr. Paul Tillich of Har-
vard, Dr. Hayner has an extensive
background in Existentialist philos-
ophy. After attending Union College
in Schenectady, N. Y., he received
his Bachelor of Divinity at Union
Theological Seminary in New York
City and his Ph.D. at Columbia Uni-
versity.

 

Dr. Hayner plans to present in
outline the main teaching of
the Existentialist movement as a
whole, discussing the bearing of
the philosophy on both the Chris-
tian and non-Christian points of
view. Some of the issues that Ex-
istentialism has raised will be
brought up for discussion and
criticism,

Dealing with a subject that has
confused so many students, Dr.
Hayner says he will have a method
of presentation which will bring the
philosophy into a sharp focus. He
adds, however, that the purpose of
the discussion is merely to show that
Existentialism is not just a name,
but a way of thinking which has
come alive.

 

Rabbi Wice Well-Known Leader

Rabbi David H. Wice of Congrega-
tion Rodeph Shalom in Philadelphia
will be a supporting speaker for
the Religious Emphasis Week, Nov.
9-11. Dr. Wice will speak Wednesday
evening, November 9, on “Religion,
Sex, and Marriage” and Thursday
evening, Nov. 10, on “Science and
Religion.”

W&L Graduate

Dr. Wice graduated from Washing-
ton and Lee, with the degrees of
Bachelor and Master of Arts. While
a student here he was elected to
Phi Beta Kappa, Kappa Phi Kappa,
and other honorary groups. He was
recipient of the Howard Houston
teaching fellowship, “The highest
academic award given by the Univer-
sity.” In 1948, he was awarded the

honorary Doctor of Divinity degree.

After five years of rabbinic
training at the Hebrew Union Col-
lege in Cincinnati he was ordained
a Rabbi in 1933. In 1954, he received
the Honorary degree of Doctor of
Hebrew Letters. Having served as
Rabbi of Temple Israel in Omaha,
Neb., and of Temple B’nai Jesh-
urun in Newark, N. J., Dr. Wice
now has a life tenure with his
Philadelphia congregation at Ro-
deph Shalom.

In each of these cities, Dr. Wice
has been an active worker in the
community. His work has dealt
mainly with social service, especial-
ly in the field of family life. He
has lectured at many universities
throughout the country, and has

served on the Executive Committee
of the Central Conference of Amer-
ican Rabbis, and on the Board of
Governors of the Hebrew Union
College—Jewish Institute of Religion.
In 1954 he was elected president of
the Philadelphia Board of Rabbis,
and in addition to this position, he
serves on numerous other Philadel-
phia boards in such fields as mar-
riage, family, and education.

Dr. Wice has traveled in many
countries of the world and has been
made chairman of the “World Com-
mittee for Liberal Judaism in Is-
rael.” He was formerly American
Director for the World Union for
Progressive Judaism.

George Birdsong, UCA publicity
director, says that Dr. Wice should

 

 

 

add variation to the program.

Study By Phillips Published
In Economists’ Journal

Dr. Charles F. Phillips, Jr., assist-
ant professor of economics at Wash-
ington and Lee University, is the
author of an article in the forth-
coming November issue of Land Ec-
onomics, a quarterly journal distrib-
uted to major American colleges and
universities.

The article—entitled “The Com-
petitive Potential of Synthetic Rub-

ber”—is a revised chapter from Dr.

Phillips’ thesis for his Ph.D. from
Harvard University. The paper deals
with the question of whether syn-
thetic rubber can or cannot com-
pete with natural rubber.

tional college distribution by the
University of Wisconsin.

Syme To Speak
On Duke Plan

Mr. Sam Syme of Duke Univer-
sity, a Washington and Lee alumnus,
will be on the campus on Thursday,
Oct. 27, to discuss the Duke Master
of Arts in Teaching Program with
interested students. Appointments
may be made with Dr. W. M. Hin-
ton in duPont 204.

The Cooperative Program in
Teacher Education at Duke has re-
cently been expanded under a grant
from the Ford Foundation. Approx-
imately 40 students will be accepted
into the fifteen month program for
1961-62. Upon completion, the stu-
dents will have received a full year’s
salary and experience as a teacher,
tuition scholarship, a master’s de-
gree and certification for public
school teaching.

 

Two summers of academic work
are taken on the Duke campus
and in the intervening year, the
intern teaches in one of eight co-
operating public school systems in
North Carolina and Virginia.

Washington and Lee is one of 23
colleges formally allied with the Co-
operative Program from a five state
area. Dr. William Hinton, the official
W&L representative, said, “the Pro-
gram in Teacher Education at Duke
is considered to be an all univer-
sity responsibility. As a result, it
operates under an advisory commit-
tee consisting of the Dean of the
Graduate School of Arts and Sci-
ences, the Chairman of the Depart-
ment of Education, and professors
from the humanities, the natural sci-

 

ences, and the social sciences.”

Oder, Chairman

Of Local GOP,

Challenges Democrats To Debate

Henry Oder, Jr., a young Lexing-

 

ton attorney, has issued the follow-
ing challenge: “I will debate anyone
favoring the Democratic ticket on
any phase of the 1960 Presidential
campaign.” Oder informed the Tues-
day Ring-tum Phi that if any person
answering this challenge would con-
tact either Chris Harrell or Bob
Chipley at the Paramount, he would
gladly answer the challenge.

 

Student Bar To Hear Talk
On Law’s Practical Aspect

The Student Bar Association will
present Mr. Arnold Schlossberg at
7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 27, in
the Moot Court room on the third
floor of Tucker Hall.

The subject of Mr. Schlossberg’s
talk will be Legal Economics—a
Law Student’s Viewpoint. He will
deal with the practical aspects of
a law practice. All members of the
Student Body and especially the
pre-law students are invited to at-
tend. A reception will follow the
lecture in the student lounge of
the Law School.

 

Seminar Members Chosen
Dr. Borden Announces

Yesterday, Dr. Ross Borden, head
of the English Department, an-
nounced that the English Seminar
Committee had elected seven new
members. “Two of the appointments,”
he said, “were given to members of
the faculty. The five remaining
members were selected from the stu-
dent body.”

Dr. Cecil Eby and Dr. Francis
Drake are the new faculty mem-
bers of the Seminar Committee.
The new student members are as
follows: James McClung, Bob Al-
len, Ray Robrecht, Ken Kleeman,
and Meade Christian.

The English Seminar Committee,
which is a self-perpetuating body,
selected the new members on the
basis of their interest in Seminar
Committee work. In the future, they
will help decide which speakers will
be invited, help in arrangement, and

 

actively participate in seminar pro-
grams.

 

 

Oder added two stipulations to
the debate. First, that there be a
completely non-partisan moderator,
and then that his opponent from the
Democratic camp inform him as to
the general items in the campaign
that he wished to challenge.

Oder said, “I am ready and will-
ing to argue any point in the cur-
rent campaign, be it foreign affairs,
domestic affairs or other issues. All
I ask is that the subject matter
under debate be agreed upon by
both sides. I hope that some inter-
ested Democrats answer my chal-
lenge, as I feel that such a debate
might serve to point out some im-
portant differences in the Democratic
and Republican platforms.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Che Ring-tum Phi

Nixon-Lodge Ticket Best For The U.S.

The Tuesday Edition of the Ring-tum Phi endorses the
Nixon-Lodge ticket in the 1960 presidential campaign. We
feel that the Republican ticket offers the candidates who are
most qualified to deal with both the domestic and international
problems which face the United States today. We also feel
that the Republican platform comes closer to espousing con-
servative principles of government which the Democratic Party
in the “Solid South” has stood for in the past and is fighting
for in the present.

The Republican candidates are most qualified to govern.
Vice-President Nixon has served in the lower house of our
national government. He has been Vice-President of the United
states for eight years. He has experience which his opponent
unquestionably lacks. We feel that his years as vice-president
have been a good conditioner for the struggle that lies ahead of
the next President of the United States.

Henry Cabot Lodge has been our representative to the
United Nations, where he led the fight of the free world against
Communist domination. By virtue of his position in the UN,
Lodge is probably the best informed man in the nation in the
field of international politics. He will be a more able adviser
to the President during this age of intenational strain than will
the Democratic vice-presidential candidate.

The “religious issue” is very real in this campaign. It is
so real that leaders of the Democratic Party have seen fit to
ally themselves with some of our outstanding religious leaders
in anti-bigotry societies, and even to hint that those who vote
the Republican ticket are religious bigots. The Democratic
candidate’s religion has become a political football which the
party’s leaders are determined to carry to pay dirt.

We turn now to the Democratic platform. That platform
which guarantees freedom of speech, press, assembly, etc., but
which denys the people of the states to the right to enact “right
to work laws.”

The platform which was adopted in Los Angeles and
which both of the Democratic candidates have unqualifiedly
endorsed rejects the principle that “the right to join a union”
presupposes “the right not to join a union,” in order to get
a job. That principle which seems to us to be one of the bases
of individual liberty in our country has been officially rejected
by the national Democratic Party and apparently by its candi-
dates and most of its informed supporters.

Mr. Nixon and his running mate as well as the Republican
platform have made it clear that they will do everything in their
power to protect the rights of the individual citizen and to as-
sure the people of this country of a government under which
private enterprise and initiative will not be swallowed up by
the federal leviathan.

Concerning the labor issue, the Democratic candidate has
said, “The American labor movement wants for America what
I want for America. .. The American labor movement op-
poses what I oppose. Their goals are the goals of all America,
and their enemies are the enemies of all progress.”

He has stated further that the interstate nature of com-
merce and industry makes “uniformity” advisable in laws per-

eral instead of state regulation of “right to work laws,” schools, |
etc.

Uniformity, especially compulsory uniformity, is a liberal
word. Liberals don’t want diffusion of power as a curb against
absolutism. It cramps their style. They want a government in
Washington that will implement the Reuther-Schlesinger ideol-
ogy to regulate the social, educational, and economic life of the
nation.

Mr. Nixon said in his Capitol speech, “if you believe in that,
don’t vote for us.”

The Democratic stand on the Quemoy-Matsu issue has
been modified somewhat in the past week. We still believe that
the stand that they (the Democratic candidates) have taken
is weak. We believe that these islands should be defended, and
that preparation should be made for their defense before they
are attacked.

We do not understand this talk of defending only those
countries that we are committed to defend against Communism.
We believe that, as long as any country in the free world is
willing to accept or to solicit our aid in fighting the creeping
spread of Communism, we should do all that is within our
power to support them. It is more than a matter of principle.
It is a matter of life or death; the life or death of the free world
and the democratic principle.

Hitler fed on Europe in small bites. It is the avowed pur-
pose of International Communism to dominate the free world
by whatever means possible. Every inch of free land and every
free man that falls within the iron or bamboo curtains is another
inch or another man toward the fulfillment of that purpose.
Peace at any time is not worth Communist domination of the
countries of the world. The US should draw the line and be
ready to defend any inch of free territory that wishes to re-
main free.

It should also be remembered that Quemoy and Matsu
are excellent observation posts from which activity on the
Chinese mainland can be watched. The Quemoy group domi-
nates the approach to the important Communist port of Amory,
while the Matsu group can partly obstruct the sea approaches

or at least neutralized before a successful Communist attack
could be made on Nationalist-held Taiwan.

Mr. Nixon has maintained throughout the campaign that
he would defend these islands from Communist aggression.
We believe he is absolutely right.

We are strongly convinced that Mr. Nixon and his run-
ning mate are the best men to lead America for the next four
years because of their abilities, their experience in high office
and in international affairs, and because of the stands that they
have taken and the opinions that they have expressed through-
out the campaign.

We trust that the American voter will not be overwhelmed
by the popular appeal of the Democratic candidate. He has
been described in a campaign speech by a Democratic senator of
some renown as a cross between Elvis Presley and FDR. From
anything resembling Elvis in the White House, Good Lord

to the port of Foochow. Both groups would have to be captured :

Each issue in the 1960 Presidential campaign must be put

in its place as a token of the larger issues dividing the nation
and the world. Most voters will find that the campaign will not
entail any immediate gain or loss for them. They will, therefore,
base their vote on their conscious or unconscious attitude to-
ward these larger issues.
We are looking for two things as we follow this campaign:
each candidate’s attitude toward the the relationship between
government and the individual; and each candidate’s attitude
toward the relationship between the United States and the rest
of the world.

Senator John Kennedy and the liberal wing of the Demo-
cratic party, beginning with the degrading spectacle of the Dem-
ocratic convention at Los Angeles, have shown every willingness
to steamroller their ideas, right or wrong, through whatever
obstacles encountered. The Democrats are avowedly more
ready to have the federal government step in where they con-
sider the work of private interests or state and local govern-
ments inadequate.

We fear and decry this trend toward big government. Per-
haps free enterprise and capitalism do not produce the rate of
growth the Russians claim, perhaps every single man, woman
and child is not assured of material comfort, perhaps we have
lost prestige in the world. But we are free and we are capital-
istic.

We would rather see the United States remain a bastion of
freedom and of capitalism.

Yet every additional tax, every power taken by the fed-
eral government from the states and localities, every new beau-
rocrat ensconced behind a desk in Washington, every new con-
cession to the power of organized labor pounds one more nail
into the coffin of individualism and capitalism.

Freedom and capitalsm are not unmitigated gifts. They
presuppose a certain courage and force of character. They de-
mand the individual choose his own way and choose to discipline
himself to follow that way. The frontiersman has long been
an American symbol of these qualities. Is this self-sufficient and
proud character to be driven from our heritage by the doctri-
naire “‘New Frontiersman,” out of the Ivy League? Mr. Nixon
knows what it is to succeed by dint of one’s own talent and ini-
tiative and he knows how to keep this ideal alive.

Mr. Kennedy tells us that United States prestige has de-
clined. But let us remember that prestige is relative. We could
not help but lose some prestige as other nations began to
rival our wealth. But let us consider what type of prestige we
would have.

WE HAVE LOST THE COLD WAR IF WE RESORT
TO INCREASING CENTRALIZATION OF GOVERN.
MENT TO “BEAT” THE RUSSIANS. The American peo-
ple must somehow find the strength within themselves as indi-
viduals to make the sacrifices necessary to assure the survival of
democracy. Now is the time for the generation of men now in
college to commit themselves to lead the United States toward
the finest achievement in government, economic life, science,
literature, art—in every facet of life. Let us prove these are
goals worth achieving as free individuals, in the service of de-

 

 

taining to labor relations management. Uniformity means fed-

The $300,000 Robert E. Lee Re-
search Fund, announced Friday by
President Cole, appears to be a
milestone in the academic history of
W&L. In addition to being the uni-
versity’s first large research allot-

ment of a general nature, it carries |

with it some interesting concepts of
educational philosophy.

Beginning this year, students and
professors will be able to apply for
funds for research projects, experi-

 
 

——

 

 

 

 

 

 

ments, and seminars. The students—
from freshmen on up—will probably
undertake their projects with a
specific professor, but in some cases
may work independently.

Ultimately, every student at W&L
may feel a direct or indirect effect
from the fund.

The projects will be of three
kinds: those conducted by faculty
members with student assistance;
those conducted primarily by stu-
dents; and interdepartmental pro-

 

 

 

 

 

 

grams. A faculty committee will
administer the fund.

As a starting point, 15 faculty pro-
jects are already under considera-
tion. If, for instance, a history pro-
fessor wants to explore a certain bat-
tle, he might ask competent students
to help him glean pertinents facts
from the mountainous piles of avail-
able material. Or a science profes-
sor, wishing to use a new experi-
mental device in his lab, might ask
a student to help him construct it.
These student assistants, besides get-
ting a first-hand look at research,
would be paid out of the fund.

In allowing some projects to be
originated by the students them-
selves, the fund aims to give them
a taste of intensive research while
they are still undergraduates.
As long as a project is useful to
the student himself—and this is an

government control of the economic

ably we have a great deal of control
now, and the quarrel is whether we
should extend it still still further.
Senator Kennedy feels we must in

superiority vis-a-vis the Soviet

competition with the Russians we
must not make the mistake of be-
coming like them. What good can
it be to best them and end up with
a society which cannot be distin-
guished from theirs.

And like theirs in every respect,
for it is the contention of the con-
servatives that freedom is indivisible,
that political freedom cannot be sep-
arated from economic freedom. This
was true in the days when the big
corporations held sway and _ the
workingman was pretty much polit-
ically impotent. He who controls
our bread controls our lives, and it
would be stupid to entrust a party of
a government with this power just
because we think they would not
abuse the trust. In the history of
governments, it has always come
about that power, once granted or
seized has eventually been used to

 

In essence, Senator Kennedy is

states to entrust their lives to him,
in return for which he will keep
them fed, housed and amused to
the extent which he and his ad-
visers think is good. The remainder

Generals Tie Johns Hopkins; Frosh Win

Generals Find Blue Jays Tough

As An Offensive

By JACK COVER

The Five-Star Generals remained
unbeaten Saturday as they battled
the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays to an
8-8 tie, before a large Parents’
Day crowd. The tie assured Wash-
ington and Lee of its best season since
1951, when the Generals’ subsidized
team compiled a 6-4 record. Wash-
ington and Lee’s string stands at
six, and Johns Hopkins’ streak is
now eight, with both teams keeping
their undefeated records intact.

The Generals were hardpressed
in gaining the tie as the Blue
Jays completely dominated the
play in the second half. Their
drives led by Henry Ciccarone,
were stopped many times by pen-
alties, fumbles, and bad breaks.

The game opened with Washing-
ton and Lee’s Jim Russ taking the)
kickoff for twenty-five yards to the!
forty. The Generals were unable to
move the ball and had to kick on
fourth down. The Blue Jays then be-
gan to march with Ciccarone doing |
most of the running from his tail-|
back position. Bob Funkhouser |
stalled the drive with an intercep- |
tion on the Generals’ 12.

 

Early in the second quarter, the |
Generals began to move towards |
their only score. The crucial play
of this drive was a screen pass
from Suttle to Charlie Gummey
for eight yards and a first down.
Hickey, who was playing his first
complete game of the season, took
the ball around end for 26 yards
to the 2. Hickey ran it over for
the score with ten minutes left
to play in the quarter. Keesee add- |
ed the two points on a slice off left |
tackle. |

The Blue Jays took the kick-off |
and started their scoring march from |
their 30-yard line. Led by Ciccarone |
and Harry Leet, Johns Hopkins drove |
to the two, where Ciccarone scored
on a run around left end. On the
same type of play, Ciccarone added
the two extra points. The Generals |
then moved down to the 30-yard
line, before John Doud intercepted
a pass and brought it back to the
W&L 48-yard line. The half ended)
after the next play with the score |
tied 8-8.

The second half saw Washington
and Lee on the defensive. The Blue
Jays took the kick and marched

to the Generals’ 42, where they
were forced to punt. Johns Hop- °
kins recovered the ball a few plays
later—on our 25 when Suttle’s lat-
eral was deflected. A clipping pen-
alty against the Blue Jays halted
this drive and their punt went out
of bounds on the Generals’ 2-yard
line. On second down, Doug Mar-
tin quick kicked from the 4 out to
the Blue Jays’ 49-yard line.

The Blue Jays then put together
a sustained effort and drove down
to the Generals’ one. Again it was
Ciccarone’s running and passing to
Derwin Kim that spearheaded the
drive. With the ball inches away
from the goal and second down, Leet
fumbled and Suttle recovered on
Washington and Lee’s four. Martin
brought the ball out to the 15, and
then Dan Blain got away a 40-yard
punt.

The Blue Jays made their final
drive to the Generals’ 18. Cic-
carone found Kim in the open and
threw a touchdown pass, but the
play was called back because of °

Golf Team Berths
Are Announced

In tryouts held last week for the
| golf team, the field was narrowed
| down to the top nine men in a qual-
|ifying round of thirty-six holes.
| Those who qualified were Jack Var-
daman, captain; Tom Couch; Ronald
Stewart; Charles Vance; Ned Olds;
Ronald Lee; Bob Bridewell; Warren
Hughes; and Steve Henry.

Coach Twombly stated that hav-
ing the tryouts in the fall would
enable the team to have more prac-
tices under favorable weather con-
ditions, and he could be sure of |
the top six men for the team by
opening of the season in March,

The team is expected to compile
an even better record than last year’s
team which had a 4-2-2 record.

Tom Goodwin Is Named Ring-tum Phi Player-of-Week

Johns Hopkins, in last Saturday’s
game provided the Five-Star Gener-
als with what will probably be the
best test of their defense all season.
The fact that the Blue Jays were
held to a tying score can be atttribut- |
ed party to W&L’s line play and)
especially to the performance of;
Tom Goodwin, who earns this week’s |
title as player of the week.

Tom, a 195-pound guard from Roa-
noke, has seen action on the Gener-
als’ team ever since his freshman
year and has been a_ hard-hitting

 

| member of the line every year. This
year he is a member of what has
been termed the “Big Four” guards
which have proved to be an effective

AMA Defeated

The freshman football team trav-
eled to Fort Defiance, Virginia, last
Friday and captured their third vic-
tory in four starts from Augusta
Military Academy, 23-13.

A.M.A. jolted the Baby Gener-
als as they struck for a touch-
down on the second play of the
game. The score came on a fifty-
three yard pass play from quarter-
back Trott to end Blaylock. The
Washington and Lee offense sput-
tered during the first half, but a
hard charging defensive line led
by center Charlie Savage kept the
pressure on Augusta. Bruce Law-
ton from his right tackle slot
crashed into the A.M.A. backfield
and blocked an Allison punt out
of the end zone for a two-point
safety. Augusta tallied again with
a pass from Trott this time to
Gevreign to give the home team
a 13-2 halftime edge.

In the second half the determined
Baby Generals took the kickoff and
marched eighty yards to pay dirt.

The Coaches Corner
Coach Views
Hopkins, H-S

A tie is not as good as a win but
it is certainly a great deal better than
a loss. There were times during the
fourth quarter when we would have
been glad to settle for a tie but then
a few minutes later it looked as
though we might pull off a last min-
ute win. Except for a missed tackle
here and a missed block there we
might have done just that. How-
ever, the Johns Hopkins people have
quite a few “if” and “mights” to play
around with too.

We were very impressed with the
clean hard play of the Blue Jays.
This kind of play is a credit to the
players and coaches of the Hopkins
team. We think they can say the
same thing of our boys.

Terry Fohs was in on 23 tackles
and along with Jim Hickey and
Steve Suttle shone for our Gener-
als.

It is Tommy Goodwin who is my
unsung star for the game. Tommy
hobbled through practice last week
but mended well enough to get a

A FRAT TO REMEMBER

Every year, as we all know, the Benevolent and Protective
Order of Collegiate Fraternities awards a highly coveted prize
to the fraternity house which, in its judgment, has done the
most to promote and enhance the fraternity way of life. The
prize this year—eight hundred pounds of white putty—goes to
the Signa Phi Nothing chapter of the South Dakota College
of Dentistry and Renaissance Art.

The award this year is exceptionally richly deserved, for the
Signa Phi Nothing house is the very model of all a fraternity
should be. It is, first of all, a most attractive house physically.
The outside walls are tastefully covered with sequins. Running
along the upper story is a widow’s walk, with a widow stationed
every three feet. Moored to the chimney pot is the Graf Zeppelin.

Indoors, the house gives an impression of simple, casual charm.
The chapter room is furnished in homey maple and chintz,
with a dash of verve provided by a carp pool three hundred feet
in diameter. A waterspout rises from the center of the pool with
the housemother bouncing on the top.

Members’ rooms are gracious and airy and are provided with
beds which disappear into the wall—permanently. Each room
also has a desk, a comfortable chair, a good reading lamp, and
a catapult for skeetshooting. Kidney-shaped desks are avail-
able for kidney-shaped members.

Perhaps the most fetching feature of the house are the packs
of Marlboros stacked in heaps wherever one goes. If one wishes
to settle back and enjoy a full-flavored smoke, one needs only
to reach out one’s hand in any direction and pick a pack of
Marlboros—soft pack or flip-top box—and make one’s self com-
fortable with a filtered cigarette with an unfiltered taste—that
triumph of the tobacconist’s art, that paragon of smokes, that
acme of cigarettes, that employer of mine— Marlboro!

 

The decor, the grace, the Marlboros, all combine to make
Signa Phi Nothing a real gas of a fraternity. But a fraternity
is more than things; it is also people. And it is in the people
department that Signa Phi Nothing really shines.

Signa Phi Nothing has among its members the biggest
BMOCs on the entire campus of the South Dakota College of
Dentistry and Renaissance Art. There is, for instance, William
Makepeace Sigafoos, charcoal and bun chairman of the annual
Stamp Club outing. Then there is Dun Rovin, winner of last
year’s All-South Dakota State Monopoly Championship, 136
Pound Class. Then there is Rock Schwartz, who can sleep stand-
ing up. Then there is Tremblant Placebo, who can crack pecans
in his armpits. Then there is Ralph Tungsten, who went bald
at eight.

But why go on? You can see what a splendid bunch of chaps
there is in Signa Phi Nothing, and when one sees them at the
house in the cool of the evening, all busy with their tasks—
some picking locks, some playing Jacks-or-Better, some clipping
Playboy—one’s heart fills up and one’s eyes grow misty, and
one cannot but give three cheers and a tiger for Signa Phi
Nothing, fraternity of the year!

color to the weekend and also ex-

first time in years, the officials had
to delay a W&L game because the
fans were making too much noise.

again found Kim open, but this
time Kim caught the ball outside
the end zone. After an incomplete
pass, the Generals took over.

Suttle was in complete charge as he
took a fourth down gamble and
gained six yards from a punt forma-
tion for a first down on the 48. After
another first down, Suttle picked up
eleven yards around left end to the
19. On the final play Suttle, finding
no receiver in the open, tried to run
but was thrown for a loss as the
game ended with the score 8-8.
