As Reported by Harvey Allen,
“Official War Correspondent”

FROM THE FIELD, NORTHWEST
OF LIBERTY HALL RUINS—At
precisely 1400 (2:00) yesterday af-
ternoon the W&L ROTC Battle
Group, under the command of Cadet
Col. Nathan P. B. Simpson, moved
out from the area in front of Dore-
mus Gymnasium and headed for a
then undisclosed rendevous with
four H-21 helicopters (Flying Ba-
nanas), from Fort Bragg, N. C.

Dubbed “Operation Whirly Bird”
by this correspondent, the tactical
problem was to move the entire Bat-
tle Group force in column forma-
tion from the gym area to a point
north-west of the school, load mem-
bers of the raid forces in turn aboard
the helicopters, and airlift to the
Lexington Airport.

Upon landing at the airport the
raid forces disembarked, pulling dar-
ing daylight raids on the surprised
airport personnel. Within minutes,
each succeeding force reboarded the
helicopters and returned to the ron-
where a new raid

 

Fishwick Publishes Book

In American South Series

“Sleeping Beauty and Her Suitors:
The South in the Sixties,” by Mar-
shall Fishwick, was published by
Wesleyan College this week as the
initial volume in a new paperback
series dealing with the American
South.

Dr. Fishwick, Professor of Ameri-
can studies at Washington and Lee,
presented the material in shorter
form as the 1960 Lamar Memorial
Lectures in Georgia. He parallels
Southern history since the Civil War
with the legend of Sleeping Beauty.
The “five suitors” who have courted
her favor, he says, are Old South,
New South, Traditional South,
Changing South, and World South.
Only the last one can bring the
Princess to life in 1961, he concludes.

The lecture series and publica-
tion program were made possible
by an alumnae of Wesleyan College,
Eugenia Dorthy Blount Lamar,
whose aim was “the permanent pres-
ervation of the values of Southern
culture, history, and

force loaded aboad and went though
the same operation.

Going in order of companies, the
force was composed of “Day’s Dar-
lings” (Co. A), “Bryan’s Bushwack-
ers” (Co. B), “Street’s Raiders”
(Co. C.), “Shugart’s Marauders” (Co.
D), “Bowie’s Sharpshooters” (Co.
E), and “Pardington’s Panthers”
(Band Company).

Each individual raid force was
composed of twenty men, ten in
each helicopter, which completed its
mission within the span of about
twenty minutes, from airlift to re-
turning time.

Loading and unloading in true
combat spirit, the entire operation
sonsumed less than two hours, point-
ing up the tactical advantages of hel-
icopters as to speed and surprise
in such an operation. Mainly, how-
ever, the exercise was generally to
familiarize each cadet with heli-
copters.

U.S. SENDS CDR. SHEPARD
ALOFT FOR 15 MINUTES

Astronaut Reports To Ground,
Operates Rockets During Shot

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
Shepard has completed America’s first manned space flight. A
Redstone Rocket lifted the space capsule from its launching
pad at Cape Canaveral. About 25 minutes later, recovery heli-
copters lifted Shepard to the deck of an aircraft carrier about

(AP)—Astronaut Alan

The rocket and capsule were launched at 10:34 a.m.
=

(EDT). The Redstone roared away
as thousands watched from nearby
beaches while untold numbers of
Americans watched on television.
After the launching two jet fighter
planes sped over the Cape to ob-
serve the flight and recovery.

During the short flight, Shephard
switched to manual controls and
reported that the view was beautiful.
Then he fired the reverse Rockets.
All the while, he reported that
everything was going smoothly. Then
the first, and later, the main para-
chute opened. After that, the cap-
sule began floating to the water.
The capsule hit the water with
three helicopters hovering over it.

The pickup from the Atlantic oc-
curred at 10:53, just 19 minutes after
the blastoff. His flight reached an
altitude of about 115 miles and lasted
15 minutes. He emerged from the
capsule when he hit the water, and
climbed into one of the helicopters
which converged on the recovery
area .

Shepard was transferred to the
aircraft carrier “Lake Champlain,”
where crewmen were under orders
not to speak to him. Doctors and
psychologists wanted him to tell
his story without having it colored
by ideas conveyed to him on his
return.

The purpose of today’s flight was
to determine if man can perform
useful chores in space. Shephard
proved conclusively that it could be
done. His flight also puts the U.S.
back into the space race with Russia.

Reported Facts and Figures

During Shephard’s flight, the
Space Agency said he reported facts
and figures just as any test pilot
would. The Space Agency has just
issued this announcement:

“Test number 108 is terminated.
This was the Pioneer U.S. Man in
Space Flight. The Mercury Space-
craft is on the deck of the aircraft
carrier “Lake Champlain” and the
helicopter is about to land. Shepard
is about to come out of the heli-
copter.”

For Shepard, the day began
shortly after 2 am. EDT when he
was awadened at Cape Canaveral.
First, he shaved and showered, ate
breakfast and then went through the
involved process of getting dressed.
Shortly before 5 a.m. EDT he board-
ed a van which took him to the
launching pad 3 and one-half miles
away. At the pad, he peered up at
the Redstone Rocket, then took an
elevator to the capsule atop the
rocket. The capsule was sealed at
7:10 am. EDT.

But then trouble set in, causing
a holdup in the countdown. First, the
skies clouded over. And a defect ap-
perently developed in an inverter
which converts the launching sys-
tem’s power from AC to DC current.
Shepard, meantime, remained in
the capsule for nearly 4 hours. Fin-
ally, the skies cleared and the defect
was corrected and the rocket and
capsule were sent skyward.

About 290 miles down the Atlantic
range from Cape Canaveral the car-
rier and a string of destroyers
waited for the capsule to parachute
into the sea, There was a moment of
anxiety last night when a fire broke
out below decks on the carrier. But
the blaze was quickly put out. The
plan is for the recovery ship to take
Shepard to a medical station at
Grand Bahama Island after the his-
toric flight. If all goes well, Shep-
hard will go to Washington in about
2: days.

The successful space shot brought
a rally in space stocks on the New
York Stock Exchange. other issues
were mixed.

Platforms

The platforms of both parties in last week’s Big Seven
elections appeared hastily-assembled and, in some of their pro-
posals, poorly considered. Yet there was no doubt that most
of the student body feels there is a need for change in the
student government. The Independent Party, which had been
most strident in its cries for “Change!”’, swept the top three
student body offices by convincing majorities.

Six class Executive Committee representatives will be elect-
ed Monday. They, together with the Publications Board rep-
resentative and the freshman academic and law school repre-
sentatives, will have a lot of work to do next year.

It will be easy for the newly-elected executive committee
to sit back and say “Well, you know, many of those campaign
issues were blown up oversize. People don’t really care about
them that much.” Perhaps there will be fewer revolutionaries
to cry out for change at any cost, just to hear the sound of their

own long-neglected voice.

And Issues...

But the real issues will remain. Something has to be done
to bring University Dance Sets more in line with the present
social habits of the student body. Something has to be done
to keep the fraternity system alive (perhaps the biggest prob-
lem of all, and not one candidate has mentioned it) .

The Honor System is not in nearly so bad a shape as certain

parties would have it.

The University Party proposal to form a student legislative
assembly has real merit. But first, the student body leaders must
find out just how much broadening of the base of student
government the average student is willing to undertake.

And Name Calling

There has been some bitterness during this year’s elections.
Cries of “wild man,” “status quo-ers,” ““demagogue,” “machine

politician,” and “‘reactionary”

have echoed back and forth

across the campus. The name-calling has obscured issues more
than it has helped work them out.

William Jennings Bryan once likened liberals and conser-
vatives to a horse and plow. ‘“‘The liberals are the strong horses
pulling constantly ahead, straining at their traces,” he said, “the
conservatives are the plow, biting deep, making sure the ground
gets turned up. You need both horse and plow to open up a
field and you need both liberals and conservatives to run a

country.”

We need both liberals and conservatives to run Washing-

ton and Lee.

Welcome Alumni

This weekend will witness the reunion of representatives
from several former classes at Washington and Lee. For the
class of 1911, this occasion will mark the 50th anniversary of
their graduation. Other classes to be visiting the university this
Saturday are those of 1921, 1936 and 1957.

We would like to extend to those alumni returning to Wash-
ington and Lee a cordial welcome. We hope that you find on
the campus not only the marks of progress since your gradu-
ation, but also the same atmosphere charged with the vitality of
tradition that has always been W&L.

We would expect the student body to extend all courtesies
to the returning class representatives in an effort to make their

stay a rewarding one.

In Viewing The Past Campaign
Torpenscence Replaces Apathy
As New Campus Cliche

By ROBERT C. KETCHAM
Friday Columnist

I would like to submit a noun to
replace the familiar word splashed
about in newspapers, circulated
sheets and dining halls; apathy. A
lubberly like search evidenced the
fitting word to replace this worn
wonder of six letters.

With humble solicitude for the
reader I spell out the long needed
replacement: torpor, n., or further,
torpescence, n. The industrious may
flip pages to seek its true meaning
but the classic will understand when
it is mentioned that the perfect word
merely means to lie in the lap of
Morpheus.

Whitman once wrote, “I loaf and
invite my soul” yet this man believed
in a moving, restless America, On
this campus, small America that it
is, there has been more debate over
issues in the past year than this
writer has ever witnessed. Ir-
regardless of the concern over stu-
dent torpor of which much has
been written in the past there has
been a perceptable change.

In the early 1950’s much was writ-
ten about the campus life with its

 

disinterested, dilatory students. To-
day the contrary is true with News-
week’s reporting the receptions of
Goldwater and the popular soci-
oligist, Reisman, writing on rising
student concerns and involvement.

Post mortems are usually as dead
as a cadaver, whose only justifica-
tion is in the hands of a medical
student. Just as satire should be left
to the J. Swifts, so analysis to the
experts.

It is too easy for the mind to shine
up rememberances (our elders cel-
ebrating the civil war) rather than
coping with the present day reali-
ties. The immediate example at this
point is the honor system; the aver-
age student has accepted the system
as he inherited it, however, when
it was brought to the attention of
the student body there was enough
momentum to actually amend it.

No one needs to be reminded of
the banter and talk of the recent
pre-election period. The follow-up is
the most important phase. Many per-
sons ask, what will it all mean, or
state more cynically that torpor
will return, that it was all a hoax.

  

RES IPSA LOQUITUR

 

Now that it has again become safe
to walk around outside without
being hit by a
platform, I’ve be-
gun to walk
around outside.
And one of the
best places that I
know to walk
around in is the
Lyric. This is not
because the walk
is enjoyable, but
because it is im-
possible to really
sit down. But I
don’t want to say anything against
Mr. Side’s theatre, because I’m all
for the theatre. As a matter of fact,
I'm writing this column especially
for Mr. Side and his theatre. And
as soon as everyone is finished din-
ner after reading this little bit, I
think it would be nice for us all
to go outside and raise a big cheer
for Mr. Side and his theatre. And if
anybody really feels like it, Mr.
Daves wouldn’t mind a big cheer
either.

I hadn’t originally planned to put
on a big campaign for the flicks in

this column, for I was going to give
the true story about why the bells
don’t ring anymore on Sundays
like they used to.

I've been doing some research on
that, and it was pretty interesting
and I thought you all should know.
As the legend goes, they were given
(the bells, that is) to the school
by the WCTU under the condition
that they be rung every fifteen
minutes every Sunday of every
year. And they were rung with
some regularity, too, from Prohibi-
tion on. Except that they’ve stopped
this year, or it could have been last
year.

Nobody seems to know exactly
when they stopped ringing, because
nobody gave a damn anyway, and
now that they’re gone nobody still
gives a damn. As a matter of fact,
in an informal pool I took on the
colonnade last Sunday morning
about eleven o'clock, the only pollee,
a freshman, said, “what bells? I
don’t hear any bells. You’d better
go back to bed, buddy.” So I went
back to bed, but I got up in time to
go to Sunday afternoon flick, which
is what this column is about.

Astually this column is really not
about the Sunday afternoon flick, but
it is about the flicks, and especially
Mr. Side and his theatre. The legend

Craven Dodges Party Platforms
Then Suggests “Shout For Side”

of his theatre is something much
akin to the legend of the bells. It’s
sort of a remote kinship with the
WCTU, which was opposed as a
body to the Sunday afternoon flicks
because the students couldn’t hear
the bells if they were in the flicks,
and therefore their hung-over heads
wouldn’t hurt, and they wouldn’t
think about giving up drinking.

Although it is not generally con-
ceded, the WCTU is a super-subtle
group, and they oppose issues on
an almost sub-conscious level. Of
course they weren’t officially against
Mr. Side and his Sunday afternoon
flicks, but they were privately op-
posed. And that is one of the rea-
sons that the bells were installed.
They were intended to give the
sober students pleasure, and the
unsober students agony all through
the day.

But again I’ve digressed. What I
have wanted to do is to start another
campaign for “Ed Side for an Oscar”
on the basis of the fact that the
Lyric is the only theatre in the
world that can show Brother Rat
when the regular flick doesn’t show
up. Let’s hear it tonight for Mr.
Side and his theatre. And maybe
even a little cry should go up for
the WCTU and their finally silent

 

 

Carnival Is Motley

belles.
Crowd

Of Girls, Apes And People

By STEVE HENRY

Do you know what a carnival is?

It is bright lights and fat-faced
barkers and dirty hill people and
college students all mixed into one
somehow compatible whole.

That is the way it was at Lynch-
burg.

We, like everyone else, went over
the hill to see the girls.

They perform in dimly lighted
truck-tent combinations, which smell
of sawdust and tobacco juice.

For the first time that we remem-
ber, we nearly got sick, right on the
spot. No one would have noticed
if we had.

The girls are the poorest slobs of
all the slobs in the world. After the
show, we asked one of them how
she ever got in the trade.

She grunted a stream of profanity
which more or less blew the theory
that she was essentially a good girl
gone bad.

And that was that.

Later, we made it to one sideshow
that was worth the time and money.
It cost just fifty cents to see the
greatest comedy routine ever de-
vised.

The sign said “See Man Fight
Savage Gorrilla.” We decided that
the fix was on. Who would possibly
be stupid enough to get in a fight
ring with a gorilla. Then we re-
membered where we were.

The monk entered the ring first
wearing a muzzle and boxing gloves.
His pre-fight calisthenics were worth
the fare.

He jumped, he kicked, he made
jungle noises.

The crowd went wild, all 500 of
them.

There was a little old lady not
over four feet tall standing in front
of us. She could not possibly have
seen anything that was going on.
Yet she was laughing gleefully and
screaming at the top of her lungs.

The crowd wanted blood, either
man’s or ape’s, and it was soon to
get its wish.

Enter the ring one gigantic Slob-
bus Americanus, six feet and 250
pounds if he weighed an inch. He
had on boxing gloves and a foot-
ball helmet, and looked like a pro

linebacker out to make a few extra
bills.

The monk, however, was not too
pleased. He sulked in his corner for
a few seconds, while his opponent
circled cautiously. Then he attacked.

The ape grabbed his antagonist’s
feet, threw him to the mat, yanked
off the football helmet, and pro-
ceeded to clobber the guy.

Then the monk retreated to a
neutral corner.

The challenger, blood streaming
from his nose, took the offensive
and charged his opponent, which
could have been fatal.

The ape merely repeated the same
process, only this time he tore off
| the guy’s shirt and opened an even
bigger cut over one of the man’s
eyes.

The crowd was in ecstacy. We ex-
pected the thumbs down notice
anytime.

We heard one particularly loud
comment from somewhere in the
rear:

“Shucks, I wouldn’t get in thar
for a bottle of good liquor,” which
is probably the greatest testimonial
as to the prowess of the monk.

Finally the challenger threw in
the towel. He collected his five dol-
lars (he made one bill for every
minute in the ring) and fled away.

We were swept out on to the
midway by the crowd, where we
began reflecting on the entire pro-
duction.

Far be it from us to call the car-
nival “good, clean, American fun.”
Rather we would somewhat hypoc-
critically call it the most degrading,
degenerate spectacle available in this
fair state.

We say “hypocritically” because
we went to the thing in the first
place, and would probably do so
again if the opportunity were pre-
sented.

Still, we cannot help pondering
how and why the state of Virginia,
which sees ever so much wrong with
selling a mixed drink over a bar,
can allow and apparently condone a
carnival such as the one at Lynch-
burg last week to be presented.

Two state troopers, who watched
the girlie show in uniform, had no
comment on the situation.

Nor do we.

To the Editor:

I wonder if a now prominent
gentleman of our campus, Mr. Gray-
fred B. Gray, has begun to lose that
sense of proportion which a friend
of his mentions in a recent article
appearing in the Ring-tum Phi. Cer-
tainly Mr. Gray has staunchly de-
fended his convictions; this is ad-
mirable, and I am sure some of us
are even a bit jealous of Mr. Gray’s
accomplishments in the light of his
initial opposition. Out of a vague
and nebulous beginning has come
constructive criticism.

But now I ask you Mr. Gray,
aren’t you playing, as a boy, with
your intellectual integrity in order
to whet a newly acquired appetite,
passion if you will, for attention,
for the public spotlight? Haven’t
you lost your ability to perceive
yourself in proportion with the re-
mainder of the W&L World? Can
you honestly maintain that your re-
cent criticisms and charges directed
to the Executive Committee were not
in the least bit pretentious? Why
don’t you now call the Executive
Committee a toy? You might as well
for I doubt that your attacking them
as you recently did will lead you to
higher endeavours on this campus.
Stop for a moment, Mr. Gray. Con-
sider. Think. Hasn’t your judgment
become clouded?

To the Student Body:

As candidates for the Executive
Committee class positions, we em-
phatically and sincerely reaffirm the
Independent Party Platform. These
are, essentially, the proposals which
the student body endorsed in last
week’s general elections. They are
the proposals which the newly-elect-
ed leaders of next year’s Executive
Committee supported, and which
they now reindorse.

This platform calls for:

1) A Convention of the student
body in the Fall of 1961 to consider
any constitutional revision which is
proposed.

2) A fact-finding group composed
of members designated by the EC
to act as a steering committee in
advance of this Convention.

3) More than two names to be
submitted for each position on the
campus election ballot, if more than
two men are so nominated at the
Nominating Convention.

4) Restricting the Assimilation
Committee’s enforcement of conven-
tional dress to the campus, alone.

5) Establishment of a_ respon-
sible student committee to act as an
advisory group in cases of social mis-
conduct.

6) Non-judicial meetings of the
Executive Committee open to the
student body, and publication of the
minutes of these meetings.

7) A change in the procedure of
Honor System trials; so that a stu-
dent is presented with the facts of
his case, before he exercises the
option of withdrawing from the Uni-
versity; and so that conviction of a
student would be decided by 9
votes, or a 3/4ths rather than a
2/3s majorty of the EC.

8) A more responsible effort on
the part of the EC to promote great-
er awareness and understanding of
the Honor System.

This last proposal is a good illus-
tration of the fact that the Indepen-
dent party platform is not revolu-
tionary or unrealistic. It is not un-
realistic to be prepared to accom-
plish in practical fashion whatever
change is called for. And it is not
unrealistic to be prepared to active-
ly uphold traditions that should be
upheld.

In short, we propose to maintain
what is worthwhile in student gov-
ernment—but to do this too in an
active manner. It is the “gravy-
train” which contributes the real
basis for the first part of the claims
about “experience and ability.” And
we hope to provide the opportunity
of proving our ability, and our sin-

Unbeaten W&L To Battle
For Top Rung In Va. Meet

Two months ago after W&L’s track
team whalloped High Point, 104-
36, in its opening meet, Coach Norm
Lord said, “That’s scalp number one,
only seven more to go.”

The track season is over except
for the state meet tomorrow at
Lynchburg, and the Generals have
“scalped” eight opponents.

Over a two-year period the
W&L track team can boast of a
15-0 record in dual meets.

This year’s team faced only one
serious challegener—Wake Forest—
on its way to an undefeated season.
The Generals topped Wake, 78-53,
but they slaughtered the rest of their
opponents.

The scores were W&L 103, East
Carolina, 37; W&L 94 1/3, Richmond
45 2/3; W&L 94 1/3, Elon 45 2/3;
W&L i111 1/3, Hampden-Sydney
28 2/3; W&L 80, Lynchburg 42; and
W&L 87 1/3, Randolph-Macon
34 2/3.

At first glance the schedule
seems to have been packed with

 

Gamber’s Triple In Tenth Puts
W&L By Hampden-Sydney, 6-5

By HARRY MEEM

Brice Gamber’s triple in the tenth
inning led the Generals’ baseball
team to its fourth straight win, a
6-5 decision over Hampden-Sydney.

W&L won this one the hard way.
They led the Tigers 5-1 through the
top of the eighth, then H-S jumped
starter Roy Carpenter for four runs
on two singles, a sacrifice, another
single, a walk, and a double.

Neither team scored in the ninth,
then Gamber tripled with two out
in the tenth, and scored on a wild

Colonials Edge
Golfers 5-3

The Washington and Lee golf
team, experiencing a let-down after
a fine state tournament perform-
ance, dropped a 5 1/2-3 1/2 decision
to George Washington University
yesterday.

Jack Vardaman and Grantham
Couch led the Generals to a 2 1/2-
1/2 lead in the first foursome play,
but W&L could get no more than
one point from the last two four-
somes.

In the second foursome, GW’s
Marvin Singman dropped Ronnie
Stewart 7-6, and Art Rosen defeated
Will Lee, one up. Stewart and Lee
also lost the best ball, giving GW
a clean sweep of all three points.

The story was about the same in
the third foursome, where the Gen-
erals could claim only one point on
a victory by sixth man Warren
Hughes.

Hughes defeated Howie Goldblatt,
5 and 4, but GW’s Steve Ruben
dropped W&L’s Steve Henry, three
and two. The Colonials also won
the best ball, four and two.

Vardaman, with a two over par
74, tied with GW’s Singman for
medalist honors.

The loss gives the Generals a six
and two season record. W&L winds
up its season against Randoph-
Macon next Tuesday.

pitch. Gamber needed help from
Phil Sharp in Hampden-Sydney’s
tenth, but got the win.

The Generals started early, as
usual. Buck Rose led off the first in-
ning with a walk, moved up when
Lane got on on an error, advanced
on Hobbs’ sacrifice, and scored on
Williams’ single.

They scored three runs in the
fourth. Park Gilmore took first on
a fielder’s choice, and Howard Mar-

 

tin singled. Buck Rose singled Gil-
more home. Chuck Lane walked,
and then Hobbs singled to bring
in two more runs.

Lane’s solo home run, his first
of the year, led off the sixth.

The win for the Generals brings
their season’s record to 7-4. Gamber
evened his record at 1-1.

The Generals next play Lynch-
burg College, Saturday at 23:0 on
Smith Field.

 

Gamber Hits

In Clutch,

Captures Farst Victory

Two of Washington and Lee’s pitchers have an unusual
distinction: they hit in the clutch.

Rookie lefthander Brice Gamber*

joined old hand Roy Carpenter as
a clutch-hitting pitcher Wednesday.

The tall freshman “Pretzel-Ben-
der” banged a long triple in the
tenth to give the Generals a 6-5 win
over Hampden-Sydney.

Gamber’s hit not only gave the
the Generals their seventh win of
the season against four losses but
handed him his first win on the
mound,

Carpenter gained his cultch-hitting
tag when he doubled in two runs in
the 13th to give the Generals a
6-4 win over William and Mary
early in the season,

Gamber, who had early season
problems on the mound, seems to
have found his pitching form as well
as his batting eye.

He pitched a three-hitter two
weeks ago at West Virginia but lost,
3-0. Wednesday he put down a
Hampden-Sydney rally in the eighth.

The Tigers collected four quick
runs off starter Carpenter in the
eighth to tie the score, 5-5. Gamber
came in with two out in the eighth

and promptly proceeded to put out
the fire. In his two-inning relief
chore, Gamber struck out two and
allowed only one hit. The win made
his record 1-1.

It is not surprising that Gamber
stroked the game-winning hit Wed-
nesday. In high school he sported a
good batting average in addition to
a top pitching record.

Last year at Baltimore Poly High
School, Gamber hit 340 and com-
piled a 10-1 pitching record. In his
junior year he hit. 300 and posted a
5-0 mound mark.

Now that Coach Lyles has cor-
rected Gamber’s overstride in his
delivery, it looks like Gamber will
give the Generals a steady left-
handed pitcher.

easy opponents. This is true in the
case of High Point, Elon, and East
Carolina. Whereas’ Richmond,
Lynchburg, Hampden-Sydney, and
Randolph-Macon just had lean
years in track.

The true test of the Generals’
strength comes tomorrow in the
state meet against such track power-
houses as Virginia, VMI, VPI, Wil-
liam and Mary, Norfolk William and

 

Mary, and Roanoke.

In sizing up the state meet, the
Lynchburg News predicted that VMI
would again win the state title. But
it also forecast that W&L, W&M and
Virginia would fight for second third,
and fourth. This could very well
happen.

The Generals were not too im-
pressive in their 87 1/3-34 2/3 win
over Randolph-Macon Wednesday.

 

JV Lacrosse Team Tops AMA,
Loses 7-0 To Virginia Frosh

The W&L JV lacrosse team had a busy week this week
as they rapped Augusta Military Academy, 6-1, and bowed to

the Virginia freshmen, 7-0.

Coach Charlie Stow’s crew, led by
Buck Ogilvie, Hal McClanahan, and
Ed Horton, make short work of
Augusta Wednesday as they jumped
off to a 4-1 halftime lead.

Louis Mongeau opened the Gen-
eral scoring with 4:47 elasped in
the first period.

McClanahan, Horton, and Ogilvie
combined to push the Generals into
their 4-1 halftime lead with a goal
each in the second period.

John Uhlig tallied the Generals’
only goal in the third period and
Chick Owen scored the final W&L
tally early in the fourth period.

The most excitement of the game
was a fourth-period brawl between
W&L’s Bob Payne and AMA’s Bill
Gray. Before the fight was over
both benches had emptied and
everyone was involved in the fray.
After the fight was broken up, both
Payne and Gray were ejected from
the game.

Wednesday the Generals were
the victims of a lacrosse rarity—a
shutout. Virginia’s frosh inflicted
the defeat, 7-0.

W&L goalie Pete Noonan played
a top notch game in the nets, turn-
ing back 16 Virginia shots.

The Virginia goalie did not have
much to worry about, making only
four saves during the game. Virginia
controlled the play, and when the
Generals did manage to get a shot,
it went wild.

John Beers and Stan Huff paced
the Virginia scoring with two goals
(Continued on page 4)

The main reason was the bad con-
dition of R-M’s square track.

“Jungle” Jim Hickey, Mike
Shank, and Ed Croft were the only
double winners. Hickey won the
100 in 10.4 and the 220 in 24.0.
Croft took the high hurdles in 16.9
and the low hurdles in 26.5. Shank
won the mile and 2-mile.

Henry Sackett was the day’s top
performer. Sackett captured the
broad jump with the longest jump
of his career—21-8 1/4. Sackett
jumped 21 feet for the first time
in college against Greenbrier mil-
itary Academy Monday. Wednes-
day he made 21 feet on every jump.

Lacrosse Team
Plays Tomorrow

At Washington

The varsity lacrosse team travels
to Chestertown, Md., tomorrow, for
a game with Washington College.
Washington has beaten two teams
this year who have defeated the
Generals, Colgate and Hofstra.

The Washington game is the last
of the season before the Generals
finish up with the University of
Virginia here next Saturday. Coach
Bob McHenry plans to play all his
freshmen and sophomores tomorrow
to give them some game experience
for next year.

s * s

The tennis team goes for its sev-
enth victory of the year tomorrow
against Hampden-Sydney at Death
Valley. The netmen will face a
tough battle. Captain Billy Mc-
Williams is a doubtful starter at
the No. 1 singles position. If Mc-
Williams cannot play, Coach Wash-
burn will start freshman John Bak-
er in the No. 1 spot.

Coach Washburn says he will start
two other freshmen tomorrow—Jim
Mell in the singles and Bud Holl-
man on one of the doubles teams.

The Generals take on arch-rival
Virginia here on Monday. The Cava-
liers are very strong this year,
sporting an 8-2 record so far. Their
No. 1 man, Dave Dickenson, is un-
defeated in 10 matches.

The first period was a 0-0 battle,
but Virginia broke the ice in the
second quarter and built up a 3-0
halftime lead. It added one goal
in the third period, and ended with
a three-goal onslaught in the final
period.

The Generals have one game re-

Dr. Robert D. Whitaker, assistant
professor of chemistry at Washing-
ton and Lee, has been named assist-
ant director of admissions, President
Fred C. Cole announced Wednesday.

 

Whirly Birds
(Continued from page 1)

After all of the raid parties had
completed their missions and re-
turned, the Battle Group Staff, ac-
companied by Captain Hugh J. Hall,
went up for a general look at the
area, sweeping over Lexington and
the problem area twice.

Primary responsibility and plan-
ning for the operation was handled
at the problem level by Capt. Hall
for the Cadre and Cadet Major Jim
Vann for the Battle Group Staff.

The entire operation, “Operation
Whirley Bird,” was completed by
shortly after 4 p.m. yesterday after-
noon, and was hailed as being high-
ly successful and interesting for all
involved, from Battle Group Com-
mander to each individual squad
member. The “good guys” won
again.

 

Dr. Whitaker, 28, a Phi Beta Kap-
pa graduate of Washington and Lee
in 1955, will assist Director of Ad-
missions Frank J. Gilliam in office
interviews, school visitations, and in
selecting the entering classes for the
university.

Dr. Whitaker will continue to de-
vote approximately half of his time
to teaching, President Cole said.

“I think it will be extremely help-
ful to have a person of Dr. Whita-
ker’s scientific background working
with us in admissions,” President
Cole said. “With his help we hope
to interest more and better students
with special talents in science in
coming to Washington and Lee.”

Dr. Whitaker received his Ph.D.
in inorganic-physical chemistry at
the University of Florida in 1959 and
joined the Washington and Lee
faculty the same year. Earlier, he
had attended graduate school at
Yale University, where he was a
graduate assistant.

While at the University of Florida,
Dr. Whitaker served as a graduate
assistant, a teaching assistant, and a
duPont Teaching Fellow. He is a
native of Tampa, Fla.

Loves of Dobie Cilk

OLD GRADS NEVER DIE

In just a matter of weeks many of you will be graduating—

especially seniors.

You are of course eager to go out in the great world where
opportunities are limitless and deans nonexistent. At the same
time your hearts are heavy at the thought of losing touch with
so many classmates you have come to know and love.

It is my pleasant task today to assure you that graduation
need not mean losing touch with classmates; all you have to do
is jon the Alumni Association and every year you will receive
a bright, newsy, chatty bulletin, chock full of information about
all your old buddies.

—

‘Tras Seosed tour Md

Oh, what a red-letter day it is at my house, the day the
Alumni Bulletin arrives! I cancel all my engagements, take the
phone off the hook, dismiss my chiropractor, put the ocelot
outside, and settle down for an evening of pure pleasure with
the Bulletin and (need I add?) a good supply of Marlboro
Cigarettes.

Whenever I am having fun, a Marlboro makes the fun even
more fun. That filter, that flavor, that pack or box never fails
to heighten my pleasure whether I am watching the television
or playing buck euchre or knitting an afghan or reading Mad
or enjoying any other fun-filled pursuit you might name—ex-
cept, of course, spearfishing. But then, how much spearfishing
does one do in Clovis, New Mexico, where I live?

But’ I digress. Let us return to my Alumni Bulletin and let
me quote for you the interesting tidings about all my old friends
and classmates:

Well, fellow alums, it certainly has been a wing-dinger of a
year for all us old grads! Remember Mildred Cheddar and
Harry Camembert, those crazy kids who always held hands in
Econ II? Well, they’re married now and living in Clovis, New
Mexico, where Harry rents spearfishing equipment and Mildred
has just given birth to a lovely 28-pound daughter, her second
in four months. Nice going, Mildred and Harry!

Remember Jethro Brie, the man we voted most likely to suc-
ceed? Well, old Jethro is still gathering laurels! Last week he
was voted “Motorman of the Year” by his fellow workers in
the Duluth streetcar system. “I owe it all to my brakeman,”
said Jethro in a characteristically modest acceptance speech.
Same old Jethro!

Probably the most glamorous time of all us alums was had by
Francis Macomber last year. He went on a big game hunting
safari all the way to Africa! We received many interesting post
cards from Francis until he was, alas, accidently shot and killed
by his. wife and white hunter. Tough luck, Francis!

Wilma ‘‘Deadeye’’ Macomber, widow of the late beloved
Francis Macomber, was married yesterday to Fred ‘“Sureshot”
Quimby, white hunter, in a simple double-ring ceremony in
Nairobi. Good luck, Wilma and Fred!

Well, alums, that just about wraps it up for this year. Keep
‘em flying!
