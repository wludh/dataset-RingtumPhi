Dr. Ferre Holds “Extreme Middle”
As Religious Conference Closes

By P. H. ALFORD

The religious conference, sponsor-
ed by Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, and arranged under the super-
vision of the University Christian As-
sociation, past into its closing phases
today.

With the general theme, “The Bibli-
cal Faith and Modern Thought,” Re-
ligious Emphasis Week started Wed-
nesday with morning lectures.

Dr. Ferre

The main speaker, who lectured
at three morning assemblies, was Dr.
Nels F. S. Ferre, nationally known
theologian, author and lecturer.

Father Francis W. McCarthy, pastor
of St. Patrick’s Catholic Church in
Lexington, and Dr. David H. Wice,
Rabbi of Congregation Rodeth Salom
in Philadelphia were available to stu-
dents throughout the Conference for
consultation and informal discussion
groups as part of the program.

 

University Assembly

Religious Emphasis Week got under
way Wednesday morning with the
University Assembly in Doremus
Gymnasium. After the invocation by
the University Chaplain, Dr. David
Sprunt, George Birdsong, the confer-
ence director, discussed the import-
ance and opportunities offered every-
one by Religious Emphasis Week and
the conferences.

Birdsong, an SAE senior from Suf-
folk, Va., then introduced Dr. Ferre.
A native of Sweden, Dr. Ferre now
holds the chair of Abbott Professor of
Christian Theology at Andover New-
ton Theological School in Massachus-
etts, Dr. Ferre holds A.B., B.D., M.A.,
Ph.D., and D.D. degrees.

Four Positions
Dr. Ferre discussed the four posi-
tions of religion in regard to the
“castle of Christian faith.” To the right,
he defined the fundamentalist and the

, neo-othodox positions. To the left he
talked of the liberals and the ex-
treme left, the existentialist positions.
By doing so, he set the tone for the re-
ligious week.

Over the three-day convocation, Dr.
Ferre discussed the general topic of
the theology of social fulfillment.

Thursday, in Lee Chapel, Dr. Ferre
continued this major topic with a talk
specifically dealing with Existentialism.
He defined the Existentialist position
in the world today and labeled it “a
freedom without faith” with “no doc-
trine.”

The Extreme Middile

Finding no sufficient answer to a
theology of social fulfillment, in any

with all interested persons for in-
formal discussions in the Student Un-
ion. Also in the Student Union, Wed-
nesday and Thursday evening, Father
McCarthy and Dr. Wice led discus-
sion groups.

“Religion and the East-West Con-
flict” and “Religion, Sex and Mar-
riage” were topics for the first eve-
ning, while “Religion and Racial Ex-
clusiveness” and “Science and Re-
ligion” were topics for Thursday’s
meetings.

Informal gathering with Dr. Wice
and Father McCarthy in the Reading
Room of the Freshman Dormitory each
night from 10:30 ’til 11:00 were also in-
cluded in the program.

 

of these religious interpretations, Dr.
Ferre, pleading “the extreme middle,” |
‘talked on “World Religions” in his,
_ last university address today.

| From 2:30 to 3:30 each afternoon
| during the conference, Dr. Ferre met!

 

The three speakers and Lexington
churches’ chaplains ate lunch and din-
ner in the various fraternity houses
during the conference to give stu-
dents another opportunity to partici-
pate in Religious Emphasis Week.

IFC Needs Student Backing

Needless to say we were elated to read that the IFC is
proposing a stand on “Hell Week” abuses. The proposal has
merit, and the potential course of action indicated by the IFC
and its representatives is indeed long-awaited.

Although the mechanics of this system to abolish violations
of the “basic sense of human dignity and decency”’ will be
forthcoming, we feel that the only way the success of this pro-
ject can be guaranteed is by a consolidation of student support
behind it. Only if the individuals in a fraternity recognize the
need for imposing these regulations and are firm in a conviction
to uphold standards of membership which exclude all such
“cancers of immaturity” as have blighted our past, will this
movement of the IFC be truly effective.

We urge the student body

to rally behind their IFC and

insure the success of this proposal.

 

Glee Club Has Problems;
Student Attendance Lags

By JAMES VANN

Friday Columnist
What happened at the Glee Club
concert last Monday night? How many
students even real-
ized that a concert
was being held?
And for that mat-
ter, how many fac-
ulty men? Well, if
the crowd _ that
turned out for the
event is any indi-

cation, then there
weren’t too many.
At best, _—ithere

might have been
five faculty men
and thirty students, the remaining
twenty in the audience were loyal
townspeople. Surely the reason for
no attendance wasn’t lack of knowl-
edge. The performance was well ad-
vertised.

I am only glad that I was not in
the position of Professor Stewart who
had to explain to the Sullins Glee Club,
a group that had given up two days
of school to make the trip up here,
why the gymnasium, with chairs set
up for two or three hundred people,
contained only fifty or sixty people.

Of course, I am aware of the fact
that a performance has to be good in
its own merit to attract a crowd and
you can’t expect people to give up
their time to support something that
is essentially unworthy of their sup-
port. To be sure, the Glee Club might
not measure up to the standard that
many set for good entertainment, but
when they never have anyone but the
same faithful few who attend each
concert there is little incentive to try
and do well.

For this last performance with Sul-
lins, the Club sung Bruckner’s Te
Deum, a work that if performed well,
can provide pleasure to the most dis-
criminating ear. In the past there has
been quite a cry for the Club to move
away from its stock repertoire of
Gershwin and Thompson and _ try
some really difficult music. The group,
for the most part, did this and got
together ‘with another group—at
great sacrifice of time on both parts—
and did the Te Deum very well, fifty
people bothered to come....

In my opinion it was a tragic mis-
take for the Glee Club to try and
schedule this performance so close
to the one on Parents’ Weekend. This
prevented their polishing their old
songs and learning such a difficult piece
well; but, the fact remains, even if
the performance had gone well, which
it unfortunately did not, there was
really no one to hear it!

In conclusion, every one here at
Washington and Lee, both faculty and
students, has a great many demands on
a limited and precious amount of
time. But there are certain worth-
while groups that ought to be en-

couraged and supported in any Liberal
Arts school that is worthy of the name.
One of these activities is a musical
program. Perhaps this program here
at Washington and Lee doesn’t meas-
ure up to your standards of worth,
but there is only one way for it to
get better; and that is for you to
support the concerts with your pres-
ence and let the members in the
club know that you are interested and
eager for the group to excell.

The Glee Club is on perilous ground
right now and is facing quite a num-
ber of problems. And, if there is no
more encouragement shown them in
the future than is being shown right
now, then I wouldn’t blame them a
bit for giving up the idea of ever
giving concerts here and sing simply
for their own enjoyment.

Tutorial Plan New To Americans;
Oxford Requires No Exams, Tests

By JON B. McLIN
Friday Columnist

Wadham College, Oxford, Nov. 6—
After having devoted the first two of
these columns to college life and to
the maze of student organizations in
the University, I would like this week
to discuss the academic life in the
colleges, i.e, the tutorial system, and
to make some random observations of
daily Oxford life.

Perhaps the most difficult adjust-
ment which the American undergrad-
uate at Oxford has to make relates to
the tutorial system.

It is often said that the student
here can do pretty much what he
wants, academically, and the saying
generally is true. There is no compul-
sory schedule of lectures, no weekly
quizzes or semester exams, no term
papers or pledged reading.

The core of the academic life rather
consists of a weekly meeting with
one’s tutor, a meeting which generally
lasts an hour. At such tutorials, the
student reads the essay which he has
been assigned for the week, hears
criticisms of it from his tutor, and
proceeds to discuss other points re-
lated to the subject of discussion for
that week.

As preparation for such tutorials,
students are generally given a list of
four to six recommended books on
the subject. The extent to which this
reading list is used, however, is left
entirely up to the individual student.

In addition to these tutorials,
there is a rather wide range of topics
in each field which are treated in
lecture series, some of which may be
recommended to the student. Again,
the number of lectures a student at-
tends is left up to him, and most
students attend rarely or, at best, in-
frequently.

Students are, in addition, expected
to do some work during the year’s 28
weeks of vacation (the school year
consists of three terms of eight weeks
each). Again, however, an individual
may do none or a great deal of work
depending on his temperament and
goals.

Certain modifications of this program
are made for students in the sciences
and for students reading for advanced
degrees. Scientists are generally as-

Have Typewriter, Will Write

‘Mirror, Mirror, On The Wall;
Who’s The Funniest Of Them All’

By THORNS CRAVEN
Friday Columnist

After looking at my by-line above
I guess you have said by now one
of two things. Either “Who in hell
is he?” or “Why in hell is he writ-
ing a column?” I can answer these
two questions easily enough: Thorns
Craven and because.

As you've no doubt guessed this
is to be a humorous column. And as
I’ve no doubt guessed you’ve prob-
ably said by now: “I bet he’s no
funnier than the rest.” This is a
brilliant criticism of my column,
but read on, I might drop in some
four-letter words for everyone to
chuckle at.

Now that I’ve been uproariously
funny for two paragraphs, and now
that all of you are satisfied that
I’m no funnier than the rest, I’m
supposed to launch into a biting,
ripping, slashing, cutting, brilliant,
thinly-veiled satire on some well-
known Lexington and/or W&L tra-
dition and/or institution. I actually
like most of these things, but I’ve
go obligations to you, the reader,
who is never wrong, to amuse you.
And since I’m told that the Lex-
ington Telephone Company is an
object of much derision, I'll start
with it.

Dial 113... and Wait

I did a little bit of primary re-
search work to build the groundwork
for this little essay, and it turns out
that the research work becomes the
essay. I began by dialing 113. This
was just after lunch. Pledges worked
shifts all afternoon waiting for an
answer, and around 8:30, when I
checked by the booth to see if any-
thing was happening, I heard a se-
ductive voice whisper in my ear:

“Just a minute, please.”

So I sent a pledge out for beer
and sat down to wait. Around ten
I was snapped out of a nap by a
little voice coming in remotely with:

“I’m sorry we've kept you wait-
ing, sir, but we just had to finish
that last rubber of bridge.”

So I said politely:

Phat's all...”

And at that point I was hit in the
ear with a:

“Awright,

whaddaya want, for

 

chrissake!”

So I said, “Information.”

The answer I got to this meek lit-
tle request sounded like the giant
in Jack and the Beanstalk with
laryngitis, shouting through a
wind-tunnel, and saying: “Well why
in the hell did you call me, I’m only
the Information operator,” and she
hung up with a blinding flash, the
thunder of hoofbeats, and a hearty
Hi-yo Silver.

Call Cost $39.85

So I called Long Distance, was put
off, got a busy signal, then gave
up and decided to write about the
shortage of good sex magazines at
McCrum’s. But before I could get
out of the booth the phone rang,
and the original soft, sexy, seductive
voice said softly, sexily, and seduc-
tively: “That will be an additional
thirty-nine dollars and eighty-five
cents, please.” So I’m sitting here in
the booth, typing a column, dropping
in nickels, and reading the phone
book. Did you know that there are
fifty-two white pages, four blue ones,
and fifty-two yellow ones? And on
blue page four it says that “fertile
limestone soils make excellent pas-
tures.”

And like you said, I’m no funnier
than the rest.

 

Notices

A meeting for the election of of-
ficers of the Forensic Union will be
held Monday, Nov., 14, at 7:15 p.m.
in the Student Union. All members
are urged to be present for this im-
portant meeting.

The Assimilation Committee will
meet Tuesday.

 

signed, rather than a weekly essay, a
series of problems to work out theo-
retically and/or experimentally in the
laboratory. They also are more closely
supervised, generally, than arts stu-
dents; nevertheless, they are still
much more at liberty than their Amer-
ican counterparts.

Students reading for advanced de-
grees have widely differing study pro-
grams, but are all marked by a notor-
ious lack of supervision. A student
reading for a Ph.D., for example, may
not see his supervisor more than once
a month, if that often.

It is perhaps a sad commentary on
the trend of English education that the
student-tutor relationship is so much
more a formal one today than it was
in earlier days of the University. At
that time, tutors were counselors of a
personal nature, not merely instruc-
tors. Moreover, each student then was
assigned, in addition to his academic
tutor, a “moral” tutor, who super-
vised his extracurricular development,
kept check of his expenditures, etc.

If this description conveys the idea
of a leisurely approach to education,
it is perhaps because it fails to note
the proper place of formal University
training in British education.

British students at Oxford—and
at Cambridge—come up from sec-
ondary schools where they have al-
ready—during their last two years—
begun to specialize in only one or
two subjects. Once here, they pursue
courses of study at Oxford which are
specialized to the point that they
may, to some Americans, seem il-
liberal. For example, a student read-
ing English studies nothing but Eng-
lish for three years; a student read-
ing physics studies nothing but phys-
ics, along with co-requisite math,
for three years, etc.

The aim, then, of the formal Univer-
sity training is the acquisition of depth
in a given field, not breadth. And in
this, they are largely successful, ow-
ing to the system of early specializa-
tion.

But what, it will be argued, about
the idea of a liberal education? Do the
British not believe in it? The answer is
that indeed they do and indeed the
Oxford student is expected to be “lib-
eralized” while he is here, but this

 

doesn’t happen by taking University
courses in the widely varying fields
with which a liberally educated per-
son is expected to be familiar. Rather,
one is expected to learn these things in
an extracurricular way; and, indeed,
in the intellectually stimulating at-
mosphere of Oxford, if one doesn’t
learn more informally—even if by the
process of osmosis—than he does for-
mally, it can only be because his eyes
and ears are closed.

On Friday, Nov. 4, Oxford was
decked in the royal purple for a visit
by H. M. the Queen and H. R. H.
the Duke of Edinburg. It was a day of
ritual, as they appeared in the Town
Hall and at Christ Church—the ritziest
of the colleges—before participating
in two ceremonies for the University.

The first was an official convocation,
conducted, for the most part, in Latin,
and presided over by the University
Chancellor, who only happens to be
the Prime Minister as well, Harold
Macmillan.

Later in the day, the Queen laid
the cornerstone for the new building
being begun for one of the colleges,
St. Catherine’s Society.

The latter ceremony ended in trag-
edy, as three students with little
regard for royal prestige returned to
the college site the following night
and absconded with the corner-
stone. But alas, they were found out
the next day and received for their
efforts a temporary expulsion from
the University!

In acting as they did the students
were probably getting an early start
for Guy Fawkes Day which on Nov.
5 is the British version of Halloween.
Mischievous crowds and sparkling fire-
works—even if not trick-or-treaters—
roam the streets in annual commem-
oration of the abortive attempt of Guy
Fawkes to dynamite Parliament, years
ago. Police were put on extra duty and
college gates locked early in efforts
to curb vandalism this year. Never-
theless, large—if innocuous—crowds
roamed the streets..

Trifling Tidbits...
An enlightening commentary on the

British Welfare State appeared in the
London Observer recently in the form

 

of a news story. The story deals with
a man, 34 and father of seven, who
has not worked at his trade for three
and a half years because his unemploy-
ment payment leaves him more money
than would wages in his job, after
the deduction of taxes and national
health service fees.

He says: “We can manage quite
well. The national assistance board
keeps badgering me to get a job, but
why should I when it means my fam-
ily will suffer?” A more sobering
thought still: for every such case that
is reported, how many go unnot-
iced? ...

A Wadham scout (janitor-manserv-
ant) of some 30 years’ service was
asked what was the main difference
between undergraduates then and now.
His reply: “Back then the gentlemen
would change their shirts every day
and bathe once a week; nowadays
they bathe every day and change their
shirts once a week.”... Recent results
of the debates at the Oxford Union
Society are interesting for showing
trends of student thought. Samples:
A resolution that “This House Has No
Confidence in Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment” was soundly defeated; one that
“British Trade Unions Are Living in
the Past” was carried; and one that
“Capital Punishment Must Be Abolish-
ed Immediately” was carried over-
whelmingly.

The last debate followed closely after
a controversial murder trial here in
which two of the three murderers were
sentenced to hang while the third,
who was under 18, was put in reform
school.... Another controversial trial,
in which Lady Chatterley’s Lover was
acquitted of charges of obscenity, paves
the way for the novel to be serialized
in the press and conspicuously dis-
played in every book shop....The
250-odd American students at Ox-
ford are not letting a 5-hour time lag
prevent them from hearing presiden-
tial election returns as they come in.

We're gathering for an_ all-night
party at Rhodes House to hear the re-
sults piped in over short wave. British
television technicians, who are con-
siderately providing the short wave
equipment, will also have cameras to
catch students reactions to the re-

sults.

W&L Lacks Funds and Prestige
To Compete With “Ivy” League

By VICTOR LASSETER
Friday Columnist

Although Washington and Lee has
always enjoyed a reputation as one
of the better liberal arts colleges in
the South, our reputation is diminished
when compared with some of the
large Eastern schools. Washington and
Lee lacks the prestige, endowment
funds, and physical facilities to com-
pete with Harvard, Yale, or Colum-
bia. Yet in terms of absolutes, leav-
ing aside comparisons, it can be said
that Washington and Lee lacks the
necessary emphasis upon the humani-
ties to be called a true liberal arts
institution.

Our school of commerce, for instance,
has been established since the turn of
the century, but our fine arts depart-
ment was not established until some
fifteen or twenty years ago. We gradu-
ate a large number of executives, law-
yers, and journalists, but very few
historians, novelists, or critics.

If these executives, lawyers, and
journalists were the product of a lib-
eral education then Washington and
Lee would have accomplished her as-
piration: “to put major emphasis upon
broad cultural or general training.”
Fortunately, there is little emphasis
upon technical courses at Washington
and Lee, but there is not a correspond-
ing emphasis upon broad cultural
training. Our humanities courses too
often produce dilettantism. Among the
student body existentialism, Cezanne,
and Faulkner are spoken of quite free-
ly, but not taken seriously.

Courses in modern art and contem-
porary literature are nonetheless popu-
lar here, with humanities majors and
commerce students alike. The product
of such training, of course, is the well-
rounded man. What is this well-

 

rounded man? He is, according to the
artist Ben Shahn (from his 1957 lec-
tures at Harvard), “likely to be most
strikingly wanting in accomplishment
of perceptivity, in the noncurricular
attributes of sensitiveness and of con-
sideration toward all those finer arts
which are generally conceded to have
played a great part in the humanizing
of man.”

In spite of our claim to be a liberal
arts institution we are often embar-
rassed or outraged in the presence of
art, and we are often guilty of anti-
intellectualism. The outrage or em-

 

barrassment can be seen almost every
day in the duPont Hall art gallery;
the anti-intellectualism in our concept
of the gentleman’s “C” average.

There are at least three reasons for
this lack of emphasis upon the human-
ities and the ensuing dilettantism. We
are not endowed with the advantages
of a large-city cultural atmosphere
such as Columbia enjoys in New York
City. The sociological make-up of
our student body is such that many
students have decided to go into busi-
ness even before they come to Wash-

Washington and Lee Students Behind Team;
A Victory For Non-Subsidized Athletics

By MALCOLM BROWNLEE
Friday Columnist

Support of Washington and Lee’s
athletic policy reached a new peak
two weeks ago when an unexpectedly
large number of students made the
trip south to view the game with
Hampden-Sydney. The number of
Generals’ supporters at the game was
especially remarkable in light of the
fact that a dance weekend was in
process at the same time. There had
been many predictions that only a
small handful of students would be
present, but the number there ex-
ceeded the most optimistic expecta-
tions.

Most of the students who attended
the game undoubtedly had purchased
dance plans and thus were able to see
the Four Freshmen for no extra
charge. That they made the two-hour

| trip to the game instead shows a high-

ly commendable amount of school
spirit and loyalty.

 

The team can be more proud of this
type of support than any other, in-
cluding national publicity. One pur-
pose of intercollegiate athletics is to
promote school spirit. Much of the
criticism of non-subsidized athletics
has rested on the premise that such
a policy would produce an apathetic
student body and alumni with no
school loyalty. The attendance and
spirit at this year’s games seem to
destroy the foundations for this ar-
gument.

Thus the team member in viewing
this year’s attendance can feel a sense
of accomplishment. The team appre-
ciates school support more than the
average fan realizes. Much of football
is psychological, and student enthus-
iasm can, in some cases, provide an
impetus which means the difference
between victory and defeat. The sup-
port of the faculty and student body
puts a game on a higher level. It
makes it not only an individual and
team effort, but also school effort.

Watch Out, Sewanee! |Generals Draw Up Battle Plans
© ® For Seventh Victim -- Sewanee

 

Washington and Lee’s Jim Hickey is on the move

Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow can
keep Coach Lee McLaughlin’s Five-
Star Generals from their destiny—an
unbeaten season.

Playing in a steady rain last Sat-
urday, the Generals sloshed to a
6-0 win over Carnegie Tech.

Tomorrow the Generals meet Se-
wanee, the last team that was able to
defeat them, in W&L’s final home
contest at 2 p.m. on Wilson Field.

The Generals have rolled to seven
victories and one tie since they lost
to Sewanee, 15-14, last November in
the rare air atop Sewanee Mountain.

And it was the weatherman who
dealt the Generals a losing hand at
Sewanee.

Rain came down in avalanches,
a biting wind howled out of the
north, the temperature hovered just
above freezing, and a fog, so dense
that neither the fans nor the teams’
benches could see the play most of
the time, covered the field.

Even though the weather was un-
friendly, the Generals were their own
worst enemies. W&L mistakes gave
the Tigers both of their touchdowns.
The first Tiger score came on an
intercepted screen pass and their win-
ning touchdown followed a W&L
fumble in its own end zone.

“The conditions here Saturday could
not possibly be worse than last year’s

: weather at Sewanee,” McLaughlin said.

After bridging a gap at left half-
back caused by a wave of injuries,
McLaughlin has a new trouble spot—
end.

 

Steve Hawkins Leads Generals Over Virginia

In 4-0 Tilt; Soccermen Prepare For ‘Tourney

Washington and Lee’s highly erratic
varsity soccer team bounced back
from last Saturday’s pathetic loss to
Roanoke College, and trampled the
Wahoos from Charlottesville, 4-0, in
a contest here Wednesday.

Once again the Generals came to
life behind their forward scoring wall,
and once again it was center forward
Steve Hawkins who led his team to
victory—this time by scoring three
goals.

It may be remembered that in the
North Carolina State game a week
ago, it was Hawkins who pounded
the nets with four tallies that after-
noon.

In Wednesday’s contest Hawkins
put the Blue and White ahead early
in the first period as he sent the ball
past U.Va. goalie Duke Felt with barely
three minutes gone in the game.

Late in the second quarter, the
Generals put on a scoring splurge
as Hawkins picked up his second
goal. Moment later, right inside Jim
Starkey placed the ball out of reach
and into the nets as the scoring end-
ed for the half.

With a 3-0 halftime lead, W&L put
the finishing touches to their perfect
day as Hawkins powered his way
through the Cavalier defense and
added his third score of the afternoon
and the Generals’ final tally.

One sour note was sounded in the
contest, however, as a second period
pileup resulted in the injury of
General fullback Dunlop Ecker.
Ecker received a severe ankle in-
jury, and was lost to the team for
the remainder of the game.

With a 4-4 season thus far, the
Generals now prepare for the State

The only obstacle to this second an-

College itself, which may accept a
NCAA bid to the Regional soccer
finals. In this event the State Chap-
ion will still be decided, yet there
will be a different location for the
contest.

Last year in the tournament held
here in Lexington, W&L placed second
in the State behind Lynchburg’s pow-
erful eleven. Earlier this season Lynch-
burg defeated the Generals 7-1 on

Both first unit end Ned Hobbs
and second unit end Landon Butler
were injured in the Carnegie Tech
game. Hobbs was sidelined with a back
injury on the third play of the game.
Later in the first quarter, Butler re-
ceived a severe cleat wound on his
ankle. He is lost for the season.

Also out of action for the Sewanee
contest are quarterback Phil Sharpe
and tackle Tom Budd.

The Tigers will bring a single-

Saturday. McLaughlin hopes the
Generals will have better success
against Sewanee’s single-wing than
against Johns Hopkins’ double-

8-8.

Centre, 21-6.

“Sewanee has been an opportunist
again this year,’ McLaughlin said.
“Hampden-Sydney made _ mistakes
against Sewanee and lost, if we make
mistakes, we’ll suffer, too.”

The Tigers’ offense is centered
largely around sophomores and-
freshmen. The main cogs are tailback
Wallace Pinkley, a 150-pound soph-
omore, and freshman fullback Pete
Woods, a 185-pound speedster.

A sharp passing attack may be a
secret weapon the Tigers plan to spring
on the unsuspecting Generals.

“We've seen Sewanee twice on wet
days when they couldn’t throw too
much, so we don’t really have a fair

appraisal of their passing game,” Mc-
Laughlin said.

The Generals, unbeaten, and once
tied in seven games, are seeking their
first undefeated season since 1914. They
hope to make Sewanee their seventh
victim.

In 1958, Sewanee crushed W&L, 12-
0, on their way to an unbeaten season.
Oddly enough, the Generals were
the Tigers’ seventh victim that year.

A MODEST PROPOSAL

A movement is afoot—a shocking, startling movement—to
solve the problem of overcrowded colleges by the simple expe-
dient of refusing admission to women at coeducational schools!

It is argued by proponents of this plan that in today’s world
a college education is absolutely essential for a man, while for
a woman it is merely a pleasant interlude between adolescence
and housewifery. There is simply not room enough for both men
and women in our overburdened colleges; therefore, in all fair-
ness, women who have far less need of a degree than men, mist °
yield their places.

Well sir, when I heard this drastic proposal, I was so shocked
that I sat right down and lit a Marlboro. I always sit right down
and light a Marlboro when I am shocked. I also always sit right
down and light a Marlboro when I am not shocked. There is
no time, no condition, no mood, no estate when it isn’t a source
of soul-deep gratification to settle back and have a full-flavored
smoke— Marlboro, the filtered cigarette with the unfiltered taste
—Marlboro, the jewel of cigarettes— Mariboro, the pinnacle of
the tobacconist’s art— Marlboro, my comfort, haven, and eng
harbor.

Well sir, I sat smoking my Marlboro and thinking over the
shocking proposal to keep women out of coed schools, and hoping
fervently that another solution can be found. If the calamitous
day ever comes when women are banned from coed colleges, I
will gnash my teeth and rend my garments and take to my bed
without supper. Like any other Marlboro man, I love women.
I love the sight and sound of them, the cut of their jibs, their
beauty and grace, their cunning little spitcurls, their sleek
dimples, their middy blouses, their aura and effluvium. More-
over, I freely admit that when it comes to brainpower, they can
give the average man cards and spades and big casino too. It
would be a shame, a disgrace and a catastrophe to keep these
beautiful, intelligent creatures out of college.

However, it is always wise in time of fair weather to prepare
for foul. What if the advocates of keeping women out of college
begin to gather strength? We who abhor this fiendish plan must
be ready with a substitute... and it just so happens I have
one—and a mighty ingenious little plan it is, if I say so myself.

Granted that classroom seats are in short supply, and granted
that men need degrees more than women, it is still not necessary
to bar women from college. Let them go to college but—here is
the beauty part of my plan—don’t let them go to class!

 

tle tl siti 00 Saad of Hore.

This solution, it seems to me, answers every requirement. It
releases hundreds of thousands of classroom seats to needy males.
At the same time, it does not deprive women of the rich and

varied benefits of campus life. They can join sororities, shoot pool
at the Union, build bonfires for Homecoming games, pour at the

Dean’s tea, plait daisies in their hair, organize drag races, sculpt
in ice, hook rugs, walk their cheetahs, play Monopoly, find love
—in short, they can do anything except go to class.

Tell the truth, girls: Is that bad?

Dunnell Views Leading Role
In ‘The Lady’s Not for Burning’

According to Harold Clarman, drama
writer for the New Republic, there are
three basic ways of facing life: the
creative way, love and struggle with
it; the destructive way, loath and curse
it; the civilized way, suffer and accom-
modate oneself to it. The first of these
is rapidly becoming rare, the second
is a distorted form of pessimistic hero-
ism, and the third is the prevalent pat-
tern of modern intellectuals. I face life
in the third way, and sometimes even
slip back into the second. My name is
Thomas Mendip, a character in Chris-
topher Fry’s “The Lady’s Not for

since this play does not have charac-
ters, it has metaphors for men. “What
a wonderful thing is a metaphor,” I
remark at one point; and how true it
is. In fact after seeing the play the
first reaction might well be that the
whole thing was a metaphor with
meaning seeping out all around the
edges.

“The Lady’s Not for Burning” deals!
with a man, a “splendid, gentlemanly, |

dilettants, for they seek the image of
the well-rounded man, not the attri-

ity.

Our new research fund, increased
student interest in extra-curricular
seminars, and an increasing cosmopol-
itanism in incoming freshmen classes
are highly encouraging signs point-

Lovely heads are always attracted to male heads that use
‘Vaseline’ Hair Tonic — made specially for men who use water
with their hair tonic. ‘Vaseline’ Hair Tonic’s 100% pure groom-
ing oil replaces oil that water removes. In the bottle and on
your hair the difference is clearly there! Just a little does a lot!
