31 Newsmen
Are Expected
For Seminar

By PETER ALFORD
Staff Reporter

Thirty-one newsmen are expected
to attend the Law Seminar for Jour- |

nalists, sponsored by the Lee Memor-

ial Journalism Foundation in cooper- ||

ation with the Washington and Lee
University School of Law. The Seminar
will be held Saturday.

A spokesman for the Planning Com-
mittee said, “the seminar will pre-
sumably be of benefit to newspapers,
the courts, legal profession, the cause
of continuing education, and the gen-
eral public as ultimate beneficiary.”
The committee is composed of Mr.
James A. Eichner, of the City of Rich-
mond law department; Dean Charles
P. Light and Prof. O. W. Riegel of
the W&L Law and Journalism schools
respectively.

In a memorandum to the speakers
and members of the instructional staff
of the seminar, the objectives of the
convocation are set forth as “to pro-
vide editors and writers with back-
ground on doctrines, organization, vo-
cabulary and procedures of the law
and to provide guidance in legal re-
porting for the purpose of promoting
the accuracy, clarity, and interest of
writing and editing on legal topics.”

All morning sessions meet in the
Journalism Lecture Room in Payne
Hall. All afternoon session meet in
the East Lecture Room of Tucker
Hall.

The Schedule is as follows:
..2:15—Law of Evidence: Prof. C. V.
Laughlin.
3:00—Conflict of Law: Mr. Ritz.
3:20—Coffee Break.

3:30—Relations between courts and
legislatures: Dean Light and Mr.
Eichner.

4:15—The records of a case and
legal sources: Mr. Eichner.

After an informal discussion with
Seminar instructors and dinner in the
Evans Dining Hall, a film on criminal
proceedings will be shown at 7:30 in
the Journalism Lecture Room. A re-
ception for the members and instruc-
tional staff at 9 p.m. will end the sem-
inar.

 

U.S. Affairs Conference

Two Washington and Lee Univer-
sity students are representing the
school at the Twelfth Annual Confer-
ence on United States Affairs being
held today and tomorrow at West
Point.

The students are James Vann, a
Phi Psi senior from Birmingham, Ala.,
and Pierce Hardwick, a Beta junior
from Akron, Ohio. Both Vann and
Hardwick are attending the conven-
tion under the auspices of the joint
sponsorship of the W&L political sci-
ence department and the W&L Re-
serve Officers Training Corps (ROTC).

Major E. J. Roxbury, professor of
military science and tactics of the
W&L unit, said today that headlining
the convention will be the keynote
address given by Governor Nelson

Rockefeller.

Hard-Hitting Linebacker Honored

Terry Fohs Is Elected 3rd Center
On ’60 Little All- America Squad

Terry Fohs, five-foot seven-inch
linebacker for the unbeaten Generals,
was named to the center position on
the Little-American third team Thurs-
day.

Fohs, a junior majoring in engineer-
ing, won wide renown during the
season for his hard-hitting tackles.
After the Randolph-Macon game, the
Richmond Times-Dispatch passed over
the Big Five stars and named Fohs
Player of the Week. His picture and
stories about him have been run in
major papers throughout the country.
Weighing in at a slight 145 pounds,
his toughness in the linebacker spot
is unusual for so small a man.

The pride of Coach Mac’s defensive
unit, Fohs was in on 154 tackles this
season. His best days were against
Johns Hopkins University, 23 tackles;
Hampden-Sydney, 20 tackles; and
Washington University, 26 tackles.

Terry commented that he is proud
of the honor, but said, “As much
credit goes to Frank Parsons as to me.”
The W&lL information service pre-
pared a special 12-page booklet on
Fohs which was distributed to news-
papers, radio and TV units.

_Fohs says that he still plans to

W&L student body treasurer Sam Rayder

 

 

transfer to Carnegie Tech next year,
but he is not sure whether he will
play football for them. Many peo-
ple would like to see Fohs play a
fourth year of football for the re-
vived Generals.

Coach McLaughlin said, “It is quite
an honor for Terry. He is certainly
an inspiration to anybody who wants
to play football, and especially for the
guy who lacks size. I’m very pleased
that he made it.”

Coach McLaughlin also pointed out
that far more colleges play small foot-
ball than do large. He also noted that

the Little All-America first team cen-| (
ter from Ohio University was drafted |:

by the pros. O. U. also has an enroll-
ment of 8,000 students.

Fohs is a graduate of Baltimore

Polytechnic Institute where he was a
star halfback and linebacker. Be-
cause of his size, no school would
consider him for an athletic scholar-
ship.

Coach Donald Seibert of Dickin-
son College made this comment on
Fohs: “Fohs has demonstrated his
ability, especially as a defensive line-
backer, the last two seasons against

\Presents Fourth
Glasgow Lecture

The fourth in the series of lectures
on “The American Writer and His

| Public” will be presented tonight by
_%| contemporary novelist
* | Humphrey.

William A.

Mr. Humphrey who last evening
defended description (see story page
2) tonight will defend plot in novels
in a talk called “Operatic.”

The first of the three professional
writers appearing under the auspices
of Glasgow Endowment Fund, John
Ciardi, spoke Monday and Tuesday
evening of this week.

Miller Here Next

The concluding lecturer in the ser-
ies, TV-film screen writer Merle Mil-
ler will speak Thursday and Friday,
Dec. 8 and 9. His topic will be “The
Night Nobody Looked” and “Bach
on the Musical Saw.”

The lecturers are being held in
the Fine Arts auditorium of duPont
Hall and all students are urged to
attend. Dr. Ross Borden, chairman
of the committee responsible for
bringing these talented men to the
campus said Thursday that “The
attendance of students has been
very good.”

The Glasgow Endowment Fund was

| established by the late Arthur Graham

Glasgow, a distinguished engineer, who
bequeathed a generous sum to the

.| university to promote “the art of ex-

pression by pen and tongue.” The pro-
gram was inaugurated in the 1958-59
school year.

Members of the Glasgow Endowment
Committee are Dr. Borden, Prof. J. P.
Davis of the journalism school, Dr.
Marshall W. Fishwick professor of
ww. MW.

Dean of the College.

National Prominence

All three of the writers have attained
national prominence. Mr. Ciardi is
author of “39 Poems” and the trans-
lator of Dante’s Inferno. Mr. Hum-
phrey is author of Home From the

‘ Hill, a number of short stories and

essays and is currently writing another
novel. Mr. Miller wrote the scripts of
“The Rains of Ranchipur” and “Kings
Go Forth” and is the author of That
Winter among other works.

 

*of the Calyx and editor of the Fresh-
man Hanbdook. He is a member of the
Student Service Society, “13” Club,
and the Assimilation Committee. He
has participated in cross-country,
track, and rifle. He is also a fraterni-
ty officer and has been a member of
the Ring-tum Phi Staff.

Don Rhinesmith, a Phi Gam senior
from Williamsburg, Va., is a Dean’s
List student, member of the Student
Service Society and a Dorm Coun-
ciler.

George Birdsong, from Suffolk, Va.,
is an SAE senior. He is on the Dean’s
List, a member of the Assimilation
Committee, Glee Club, and Interna-
tional Relations Club.

Steve Danzansky, a ZBT senior from
Washington, D.C., is SWMSFC direc-
tor, on the Dean’s List, Fraternity Of-
ficer, and Cheerleader.

Chip Day, a Phi Gam junior from
North Plainsfield, N. J., is a member
of the football, track and swimming
teams.

Jim Applebaum, a PEP junior from
Flushing, N. Y., is the business man-
ager of Shenandoah and Glee Club
promotion director.

This year’s Fancy Dress figure will
deal with’ -a event in the Court of
King James. Shortly after his ascension
to the throne in 1603, the playwrights
and players were returned to Royal
favor. King James had Shakespeare
and his players appear before him
and elevated them to the positions of
Knights of the Chamber Extraordinary.
It is around this incident that the
figure is based.

The gym will be decorated like the
famed Globe Theatre in England. In-
cluded in the decorations will be a
Royal Box for the king. Also featured
will be balconies, columns, a_ raised
stage, and a workable curtain. The
false ceiling will be absent. Instead,
the flags of the various houses of
English nobility will be draped over
the ceiling, adding more color and ef-
fect.

Dr. Flournoy

The figure will be part of the de-
piction of the actual Court with Dr.
Fitzgerald Flournoy announcing. The
John Graham Brass Choir will play
during the procession.

The participants in the figure will

represent characters from six of
Shakespeare’s famous plays: “Hamlet,”
“King Lear,” “Romeo and Juilet,”

“Anthony and Cleopatra,” “Henry IV,”
and “Julius Caesar.” The vice-presi-
dents and their dates will represent
the main characters from these plays.
The other participants in the figure
will follow each vice-president.

These plays were chosen because of

 

Lexington’s cigar-smoking Sam W.
Rayder has spent more time in ex-
tra-curricular activities than any
Washington and Lee University stu-

| dent—but he’s been at it for 30 years.

The 57-year-old vice president and
trust officer of the Rockbridge Na-
tional Bank here puts in his time in
the all-important post of Washington
nd Lee student body treasurer. In
this capacity he direcily supervises the
expenditure of all student funds at
the university.

Rayder, known as “Sam” by his fel-
low townspeople and “Mr. Rayder”
by Washington and Lee students, con-
stantly consults with student body of-
ficers and the student editors of cam-
pus publications about financial mat-

 

| ters. His modernly-designed office on

the first floor of the Rockbridge Bank

| Building on Lex:ngton’s Main Street
i ‘s seldom without a student visitor.

Unpaid and often not thanked for

i his efforts, Rayder started on his fi-
| nane'al whirl with Washington and Lee
| wh'le he was a student here. He was
| the first and only student to serve as
| student body treasurer.
| post his senior year in 1930-31, and

He held this

he’s served ever since.
For 25 years, Rayder carried the dual

 

 

responsibility of the administration of
student body funds and the keeping
of books for the then 14 social frater-
nities on campus. He retired as the
fraternities’ financial adviser in 1955
when he was named to his present
position at the bank. He still serves as
an advisor for his own Sigma Chi,
however.

The most time-consuming portion
of the student body treasurer’s job is
the supervision of funds for campus
publications. Rayder handles the bud-
gets for the Washington and Lee
yearbook, the quarterly student humor
magazine and the bi-weekly Ring-tum
Phi, student newspaper.

Born in the little Arkansas town of
Watson, Rayder came to Lexington in
1924 as a freshman at Washington
and Lee. That same year he took a job
at the small Rockbridge Bank. He
obtained his law degree from the uni-
versity in 1930.

The banker’s work with the student
body funds literally has caused him
to have his fingers in every pie. He
was on committees that furnished the
12-room Student Union on campus,
bought shells for crew, and selected
seats of the present Troubadour
Theater among other things.

Rayder Has Long History At W&L

Along with the routine bookkeeping
of such a post, Rader has added the
job of broker. He invests student
funds whenever possible but always
being careful to avoid stock market
ventures.

Besides being an active layman in
Lexington’s First Presbyterian Church,
Rayder has found time during the
past 30 years to collect antique autos.
At one point he had amassed a total
of six old cars. Commercially, his in-
terest in cars led him to the presi-
dency of the Rockbridge Motor Com-
pany, a local dealership.

Son at W&L

Some of his active interest in Wash-
ington and Lee student affairs has
rubbed off on his family—at least Sam
W. Rayder, Jr. His 18-year-old son
is a freshman this year at his father’s
alma mater. Rayder also has two
daughters.

Conversation is an avocation of this
jovial banker. He is a frequent visitor
to the lunch counter of one of Lex-
ington’s most centrally-located drug
stores. He'll talk banking, cars, poli-
tics, sports or what have you, but he
| seldom fails to mention Washington

‘and Lee.

 

the wide variety of costumes afforded
by the historical periods represented.

Costumes for the 1961 Fancy
Dress Ball will be on sale Dec. 5, 6,
7, and 8. They will be sold in the
Student Union from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The costumes are coming from the
Hooker Howe Company in Haverhill,
Mass., through Oak Hall distributors
in Roanoke. This is the first time that
W&L has used this company which
usually outfits professional produc-
tions.

The costumes will cost the nor-
mal $18 per set for those couples
who do not have Dance Plans.
However, people with Dance Plans
receive the costumes for $16.

Students must be measured for the
following specifications: chest, waist,
height, hat size, and length of out-
seam. In addition they must provide
the following measurements for their
dates: bust, waist, hips, height, weight,
hat size, dress size and length of
skirt from waist to ankle. It is im-
portant that these measurements be
correct to ensure | proper fitting.

Notice

There will be a meeting of the
Troubadours Tuesday night at 7:30
in the Troub Theater. Anyone who
is interested in the Troubadours is
invited to attend.

Fohs Is Credit To W&L

Look Magazine recently rated this university as a “good”
school. Many factors are involved in making a “good” school,
and not least among them is the ability of the university to draw
to it men of the caliber of the latest Five-Starred General, Little
All-American linebacker Terry Fohs.

Fohs is a credit to Washington and Lee and to the Univer-
sity’s non-subsidized football policy. No “big” school would
consider him for a football scholarship because of his size. They
overlooked the important factor. It is to Terry’s credit that he
would come here where he gets no reimbursement (other than
the dorm counselorship which he won on individual merit)
and the cost of education is high.

A man of quiet energy, Terry is as much a gentleman off
the playing field as he is a tiger on it. He is so quiet, in fact,
that he probably wouldn’t be noticed if he were not seen knock-
ing the ball from the hands of some 200-pound halfback. Not
that he is inactive. Fohs was a tri-captain of the unbeaten Gen-
erals, a dorm counselor and maintains a B- average in the tough
pre-engineering course. His great success stems from his sin-
cerity and modesty. But when he yells “Meet you on the bot-
tom” in a game, he means just that and it happened about 150
times during the 1960 season.

Since he is on a three-two engineering plan, Terry won’t be
playing with the Generals next season. Needless to say, his
leadership and talent will be greatly missed. G. B. Hi.

New ‘Silent Generation’
Replacin g M odern Beatniks

By VICTOR LASSETER

 

 

of life to worry over the beatnik’s

Friday Columnist

Since the turn of this century each
new generation of American youth
has been placed into socio-intellectual
catalogue by the American public. This
tendency has per-
sisted, and is indic-
ative of the need to
identify with a
group, the need to
characterize the
thought of each
new generation, and
of the American
tradition of glam-
orizing its youth.

Thus the gener-
ation who grew up
on Henry James,
with their Victorian belief in progress
and their high collars and low skirts,
could be called the genteel generation.
Thrown into the First World War this
generation emerged as the disillusion-
ed, cynical, lost generation. With the
Peace of Paris and the new League of
Nations America returned to nor-
maley and prosperity. The emigres
returned from Paris and were in turn
replaced by the jazz generation of the
roaring twenties. If this generation
worried about war, depression, and
the break down of international order,
it tempered its worry with bathtub
gin and the Charleston.

W. W. Il Shattered Jazz Generation

The rise of militant nationalism
and the outbreak of World War I
shattered the dream-land of the jazz
generation and produced the begin-
nings of a generation of protest, non-
conformity, and frustration. The beat
generation emerged under the lead-
ership of Jack Kerouac, led anti-
nuclear test demonstrations, read
avante-garde poetry, and issued taunt
after taunt to the the outside world of
middle-class America.

extreme non-conformity and protest
soon captured the imagination of those
very elements of society which the
movement itself attacked. Look and
McCall’s ran feature articles on this
new phenomenon. Mothers of college
students became worried, and the col-
leges held seminars: “Should your
child become a beatnik?” Teenagers,
satisfying themselves with the hood-
lum aspect of the beat generation,
added the words “cool,” “hip,” and
“pad” to their vocabularies. Soon every
literate American became familiar with
the paraphernalia of the generation.
The beard became the symbol of the
rebel, and even the Scheweppes man
and the Mennonite farmer joined the
ranks of protest.

Never Got Off Ground

Despite the efforts of Kerouac, Corso,
and Ginsberg, the beat generation
never got off the ground. Ginsberg
and Corso failed to produce a near
Whitmanesque poetry; Kerouac ended
his period of rebellion by writing for
Escapade. Although Americans were
fascinated by the beat generation as
a cultural phenomenon they feared it
as a radical threat to normalcy, and
the police closed up the coffee houses.
The beat generation won the adher-
ence of numerous unknown artists
and writers, but the college students,
usually a dependable source of radi-
calism and protest, were too deeply
entrenched in their own normal way

challenge: “Do you let Time magazine
run your emotional life?”

The beat generation was too diverse
a movement to last. Comprised of
hoodlums, poets, artists, socialists,
dope-addicts, and teenagers, the new
movement accomplished only two
things: it enriched the American vo-
cabulary and provided a new symbol-
ism for Bohemia. The voice of this
generation was one of violent, exter-
nal protest. But a century of this
same type of protest had not prevent-
ed a depression, two major wars, ram-
pant nationalsim, bourgeois decadence,
or the acceptance of nuclear warfare.

Ciardi Sees Coufusion In Poetry;

Novelist Defends Land

By GEORGE HONTS
Managing Editor
Contemporary novelist William A.
Humphrey said Thursday that des-
cription in novels was too often just

“purple passages of landscape.”

In a special interview for the Ring-
tum Phi, Mr. Humphrey labeled des-
cription and plot as the two most de-
spised or unpopular elements in a
novel, for both the serious writer
and the serious reader. He went on
to say, however, that he would de-
fend both of these elements, and his
defense of description composed a large
part of his lecture last evening. Tonight
he will defend plot.

Mr. Humphrey, author of Home
From the Hill, declared that descrip-
tion did have a place in the novel,
but, he admitted, that one must be
careful in dealing with the subject
in writing. “Novels,” he said, “are
about people and not shrubbery. Peo-
ple want to read a story, not a place.”

|

Three Defenses

Landscape, and thus description,
can be justified when it ceases to be
ground, he continued. There are three
defenses that Mr. Humphrey takes.
First, landscape is useful when it helps
make the character more real. Second,
it is desirable when it helps create
emotions or states of being, and, third,
landscape itself can often become a
character as it did, Mr. Humphrey says,
in Thomas Hardy’s Return to the
Native.

 

Mr. Humphrey described himself as
a “rolling stone.” He indicated that he |
and Mrs. Humphrey, who is along on |
his visit to Washington and Lee, may |
go to Italy for a year or so to live)
very soon. Mr. Humphrey attended |
S.M.LU. and the University of Texas. |
From 1949 until 1958 he taught at!
Bard College in New York. The fol- |
lowing 15 months were spent in Eu- |
rope, but he and his wife returned to
be with their daughter who was then |
in her senior year in high school. She |
is now a student at Bard College.

When asked if he felt the “confusion” |
that Ciardi says the poets are now
experiencing is prevelant in novel- |
writing, Mr. Humphrey commented |
that “all arts are in some state of|
flux.” Apparently they have always

 

| been thus. The 1920’s, he said, was a; dowment Fund lecturers, poet, editor

more ferment in the prose writings.

The group of serious readers has
grown over the past few years, he
feels, due primarily to the introduc-
tion of serious reading matter in
paperback editions. Serious readers,
however, are still few and Mr. Hum-
phrey seems to dismiss the non-serious

tions. Witty and intelligent, he then
discussed “jaunts off into meaningless-
ness” such as the Beats, and said
they would disappear.

Complacency Gone

Also commenting on Hemingway, he
declared that most of the GI’s in

hopes dulled by the prospect of one! produced some great novels. It is al-
last war, turned away from external | ways difficult, he added, for artists to
protest and emerged as the silent gen- | find meaning in contemporary life. The

of World War II were not shocked by
the horrors of wars as their pre-
decessors in World War I had been.
Why? Mr. Ciardi explained that the
Victorian complacency of the 19th
Century began to break down at the
close of the century. World War I
gave this complacency another hard
knock, indeed, it seems to have killed
it,

reader readily.

Young Talent

Mr. Humphrey stated that there is an
abundance of young, talented writers
in America today. One reason for the
lack of ferment is that there is no one
subject matter which a writer can
seize and appeal to the mass of readers
in a manner such as Hemmingway did
with Farewell To Arms. A great many
people experienced war as Heming-
way wrote about it, but the subject of
World War II has been fairly thorough-| The 20th Century poet is still search-

Search for Replacement

 

 

 

But Auden writes in the 20th Cen-
tury, “Poetry makes nothing happen.”

Among other things, the poet has
turned to the impact of the unpredict-
able as an important theme in writing.
To this many readers have developed
a mental block. The devil today, Mr.
Ciardi assured his audience, is dressed
in a Brooks Brothers suit, speaks Ivy
League slang and has a Public Rlea-
tions contract in his pocket.

The poet must now face these
pleasant evils. And if there is any-
thing a poet can’t stand, Mr. Ciardi
said, it is a hypocrite, especially a
smooth hypocrite. So the contemporary
poet is angry, and in his anger he
often wants to insult the world.

Whether the poets aim is to insult
the world or to give it some truth
at last, he has changed his tactics.
Gone are “tacked-on morals” and
meaning in poetry. Instead of mean-
ing, the poet now presents an ex-
perience, and meanings are only hinted
at in the poem. Also, the experiences
have taken on a moral significance.
Mr. Ciardi concluded by stating that
it is not necessary to worry about
finding a meaning in a poem, for after
all, “A man is what he does with his
intentions.”

 

 

Downtown Oxford Has Activity
That Equals Any American City

By JON McLIN
Friday Columnist

Wadham College, Oxford, Nov. 20—
“Oxford—mighty fine place, well
seated, and cheap entertainment.”
This comment, made by Pepys in
his diary in 1668, is apropriate enough
even today.

The city of Oxford is something
deserving consideration apart from
the University, despite the fact that
the two are so closely related. This
is readily suggested by the fact that
10,000 or so students here comprise

| only about one-sixth of the city’s
What had begun as a movement of |

population.

The visitor to Oxford who comes
expecting to find the quiet, slow-
moving pace of life suggested by the
term “the ivory tower” will be quick-
ly disillusioned. Downtown Oxford
has a hustle and bustle hardly sec-
ond to any American city and great-
ly aggravated by the inadequacy of
the centuries-old streets to the prob-
lems of modern traffic. Much of the
traffic burden results from indus-
trial Oxford’s activities in the print-
ing and—alas!—automobile industries.

Proponents of the construction of
a relief road to solve Oxford’s traf-
fic problems have pursued their
goal fervently for the last few years;
to date, however, their efforts have
been foiled by the poetic souls who
are unwilling to despoil the beauty
of Christ Church meadow by build-
ing a road across it.

Culturally, the presence of the
University affords advantages which
are perhaps not equalled in any other
city of equal size. The city’s two
theatres provide continuous fare of
good entertainment at cheap prices:
the best seats in the house usually
sell for about $1.35.

As an example of the kind of en-
tertainment that is offered, dur-
ing the coming week Giraudoux’s
“The Madwoman of Chaillet” is
being produced by a_ university
group, while the other theatre is
presenting the famous old Vic

 

Company of London in “Macbeth,”
Shaw’s “Saint Joan,” and Wild’s
“The Importance of Being Earnest.”
In past weeks, highlights includ-
ed The Royal Ballet for two weeks
and the pre-London production of
“Toys in the Attic.”

Music and art lovers enjoy similar
extensive opportunities; and, in ad-
dition, the proximity of London—
only an hour’s train ride away—
opens a world of new cultural op-
portunities.

Relations between students and
residents of the city of Oxford are
nowad*ys quite good, suggesting
none of the animosities of the “Town
vs. Gown” riots of medieval times.
Lest the difference between students
and “townies” be completely oblit-
erated, however, the disparity be-
tween Oxford English and the Cock-
ney-like Oxford city accent exists as

a reminder.
*

No account of the city of Oxford
could fail to mention some of the
characteristics of the individual col-
leges which help to comprise the
downtown part of the city, as well
as the University itself.

Tradition demands that the first
mention in such _ considerations
should be given to Christ Church
(the word college is not part of its
name), known to its members as
“The House”’(Aedes Christi). It is

however, has fallen to a place near
the bottom of the list of Oxford
colleges.

There was a time when Christ
Church had only 101 students, and
Great Tom, its huge bell, can still
be heard tolling 101 strokes at five
minutes past nine each evening to
summon them home. Its chapel,
proudly designated “Cathedral,” is
among the most beautiful sights in
Oxford.

The distinction of being the old-
est college is claimed by three of
them—Merton, University College
and Balliol. Each is somewhat
justified, as University was the first
to be endowed, Balliol had the
first fixed locality (1260), and Mer-
ton the earliest statutes (1264).

my upper ear, obviously mistaking it

But I did get around, and had the
recurring experience of being asked
the embarrassing question: “What's
happened to W&L football?” This
query was particularly embarrassing
for me after bragging long and loud
for two years that we have the worse
team of anybody. And being asked
this question so many times has
raised some questions about the sub-

We've become professional amateurs.
All the football players were actually

THE RING-TUM PHI

Page 3

 

The youthful Washington and Lee
basketball squad will open its home
schedule tomorrow night against Nor-
folk Division of William and Mary
at 8 at Doremus Gym.

Thursday night in their opening
game, the Generals bowed to Bridge-
water, 57-50, despite a strong come-
back late in the game.

The Generals, who are short on ex-
perience, had a case of opening game
jitters as Bridgewater jumped to a
32-17 halftime lead.

Bridgewater pushed its lead to
55-33, late in the second half, but

then the Generals settled down and
began a concentrated scoring effort.

Using a full court press to full
advantage, W&L poured in 17 points
while Bridgewater managed only two
in the game’s final minutes.

The Generals’ late surge was a com-
bined team effort as forwards Rodger
Fauber, Ken Kowalski, center John
McDowell, and guard Brett Thackston
all contributed key field goals.

Fauber topped the Generals’ scor-
ing with 14 points. Thackston had 11,
Kowalski, ten.

McDowell, 6-6 freshman center,

pulled down 14 rebounds to lead the
Generals in that department.

The Generals actually outshot
Bridgewater from the floor, 22-20; but
Bridgewater connected on 15 of 17
free throws to win.

In the first half the Generals made
only one of ten free throws, but hit
five of seven the second half for a
game percentage of 35.3.

Both W&L and Bridgewater excelled
on defense.

Bridgewater double-teamed Mc-

entertain the University of the South
here.

Before the season began the Gen-
erals had three problems—lack of ex-
perience, lack of height, and lack of
a definite scoring punch. The Generals
now have one game under their belts
but all three problems still are prob-
lems.

McDowell may be the solution to the
height problem.

The 6-6 center from Birmingham,
New York, looked well in his first

college start.

Coach Bob McHenry pushed Mc-
Dowell, the first skyscraper that he
has had in his three years at W&L,
into a starting berth by virtue of his
height.

This move seems to have paid off.
Although McDowell scored _ only
seven points against Bridgewater, he
moved well, sparkled on defense, and
controlled the boards.

Reserves that should see plenty of

action are 6-3 Steve Rutledge, 6-4
John Culley, 6-2 Bill Ide, and 6-1
Dave Grogan.

Rutledge may take over a start-
ing forward spot early. He has been
hampered by a dislocated finger in
pre-season practice, but he is a good
rebounder and has an excellent jump
shot.

Culley was the regular center of
the 1959-60 freshman team and Gro-
gan was the leading freshman scorer.

 

Dowell a good deal and forced the*
Generals to shoot mostly from the|
outside.

Kowalski and Fauber, the Generals’ |
main gunners, sank 15-30-foot jump |
shots while Thackston and McDowell |

scored from closer in.

The General defense shined in
hclding Bridgewater’s Jim Reedy,
L'ttle All-American candidate, to |
22 po nts, eight of which came from
the free throw line.

 

Coach Joe Lyles’ freshmen started
off cn the right foot as they slapped

the Bridgewater freshmen, 67-60, in)

a preliminary.

Gordon Taylor with 14 points and
Fred Ridolphi with 12 points paced the
Baby Generals’ attack.

Tomorrow’s game with Norfolk Di-
vision of William and Mary will be
the Generals’ first meeting with the
team that is slated to replace Bridge-
water as the Little Eight champions.

The Braves are led by Leo An-
thony, one of the state’s top basket-
ball scorers for the past three years.
If Anthony is his usual self tomor-
morrow, the Doremus Gym record of
40 points, which was set by Virginia’s
Buzzy Wilkinson in 1955, may fall.

But with the excellent job the
W&L defense did on Bridgewater’s
Reedy, Anthony will have a hard time
setting a new record.

The Braves are favored in tomor-
row’s clash because of Anthony and
greater experience, but the W&L home
court factor may prove too much.
The Generals won seven of their eight
home games—their only wins of the
season—last year.

The Generals have three games next
week.

Monday they meet traditional rival,
the University of Richmond at
Petersburg; Thursday they travel to
Randolph-Macon; and Saturday they

 

Swimmers Top Roanoke, 57-38, In Opening Meet;
Parker, Maynard, Jahncke Capture Two Firsts

Washington and Lee’s swimming
team continued last year’s practice of
winning meets as they defeated Roa-
noke College yesterday at Roanoke,
57-38.

It marked the opening of the sea-
son both for the Generals, and for
their coach, Norris Eastman, who took
over the squad this year from Athletic
Director Cy Twombly.

Eastman used all nineteen mem-
bers of his squad in the triumph in
Roanoke’s odd-sized 20-yard pool.

Co-captain Jim Parker captured
two first places by turning in win-
ning times in the 60-yd. and 100-yd.
freestyle events. His time in the first
was 31.2 seconds, while in the 100-yd.
event he turned in a time of 58 sec-
onds.

The General’s outstanding swimmer
for the past two seasons, Elliot May-
nard, had a succesful afternoon as he
won the 200-yd. butterfly and the

200-yd. breaststroke.

In the breaststroke, Maynard set a
new pool record at Roanoke, trimming
the old time a full eight seconds, His
winning time was 2:31.5.

The Generals’ third big gun of
the afternoon was sophomore Herb
Jahncke who won the 440-yd. free-
style and the 160-yd. individual
medley. His winning times were
5:34.5 and 2:00.6, respectively.

Robin Dunlap picked up the Gen-
erals’ other first place by winning
the 200-yd. backstroke in 2:36.8, while
teammate Mike Harris placed second.

PiKAs Take Intramural Football Championship,
Place Seven On All-Offensive, Defensive Teams

Although the 5-Star General am
sity football team rated all the praise

| th's fall for a fine season’s perform- |

ance, the intramural football contest
st.ll remained one of the highlights of
the inter-fraternity competitive pro-
gram.

This year’s championship went to
the PiKa’s, who managed to go un-
defeated in seven games.

In accomplishing th’s task the
PiKAs rolled up 138 points while
only allowing their opposition a mere
18. Quite a feat for even Coach Lee
McLaughlin and his boys!

Led by All-Intramural quarterback
Jack Atwell, the PiKAs made _ the
final playoffs by defeating the Phi
Gams 13-6, the Phi Psis 7-0, the KAs
21-0, and the SAEs 39-0.

(Author of “I Was a Teen-age Dwarf” “The Many
Loves of Dobie Gillis’, etc.)

“THE INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT OF
NED FUTTY”

Chloe McFeeters was a beautiful coed who majored in psychol-
ogy and worked in the I.Q. testing department of the University.
She worked there because she loved and admired intelligence
above all things. “I love and admire intelligence above all things”
is the way she put it.

Ned Futty, on the other hand, was a man who could take
intelligence or leave it alone. What he loved and admired above
all things was girls. “What I love and admire above all things
is girls’ is the way he put it.

One day Ned saw Chloe on campus and was instantly smitten.
“Excuse me, miss,” he said, tugging at his forelock. ‘Will you
marry me?”

She looked at his duck-tail haircut, his black-rimmed glasses,
his two-day beard, his grimy T-shirt, his tattered jeans, his de-
composing tennis shoes. ‘You are not unattractive,” she ad-
mitted, “but for me beauty is not enough. Intelligence is what
I’m looking for. Come to the I.Q. testing department with me.”

 

' ‘Vil sou Meaerv ye 7°"

“Of course, my tiger,” cried Ned and giggled and smote his
thigh and bit Chloe’s nape and scampered goatlike after her
to the 1.Q. testing department.

“First, I will test your vocabulary,” said Chloe,

“Be my guest,” laughed Ned and licked her palm,

“What does juxtaposition mean?”

“Beats me,” he confessed cheerfully and nibbled her knuckles,

“How about ineffable?”’

“Never heard of it,” guffawed Ned, plunging his face into
her clavicle.

“Furtive?”’

“With fur on?” said Ned doubtfully.

“Oh, Ned Futty,” said Chloe, ‘you are dumb. Consequently
I cannot be your girl because I love and admire intelligence
above all things.”

He flung himself on the floor and clasped her ankles. “But I
love you,” he cried in anguish. “Do not send me from you or
you will make the world a sunless place, full of dim and
fearful shapes.”

“Go,” she said coldly.

Lorn and mute, he made his painful way to the door. There
he stopped and lit a cigarette. Then he opened the door and
started away to his gray and grisly future.

“Stay!” called Chloe.

He turned.

“Was that,’ she asked, ‘“‘a Marlboro you just lit?”

“Yes,” he said.

“Then come to me and be my love,” eried Chloe joyously.

“You are not dumb, You are smart! Anybody is smart to smoke
Marlboro, the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste which
comes to you in soft pack or flip-top box at prices all can afford
at tobacco counters, drugstores, groceries, restaurants and
trampoline courts all over America. Ned, lover, give me a

’

Marlboro and marry me.’
And they smoked happily ever after.

And if your taste runs to unfiltered cigarettes, you’re smart
to try Philip Morris—from the makers of Marlboro. We
especially recommend Philip Morris’s new king-size Com-
mander—long, mild, and leisurely. Have a Commander—
welcome aboard!

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

New ‘Silent Generation’ Replaces

Dying Bohemian Beatnik Group

(Continued from page 2)

Civil War, party all night at Jay Gats-
by’s, or protest against nuclear-testing
in Washington Square. Henry James,
Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Kerouac
were found to be inadequate. The new
generation of inwardness turned in-
stead to the whimsical irony of J. D.
Salinger.

Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye be-
came the guide-book of the silent
generation. As expressed by Salinger’s
Holden Caulfield, the new heroism
consists of a withdrawal, emotional in-
tegrity, compassion, and rejection of
committment. Holden Caulfield is non-
political, cares little about Washing-
ton or Moscow. Instead of external re-
volt, Holden turns to emotional in-
tegrity, waging war upon phonies,
phonies at his prep school, phonies
in New York, and phonies in Holly-
wood. He hates to “give them a phony
smile...It makes me so depressed
I go crazy.” Or the piano player at
Ernie’s in New York, who was “putting
all these dumb, show-offy ripples in
the high notes, and a lot of other very
tricky stuff that gives me a pain....”
And the newsreels: “Christ almighty.
There’s always a dumb horse-race,
and some chimpanzee riding a bicycle
with pants on.”

Rest Are Real People

The rest of Salinger’s world is com-
posed of real people. Holden Caulfield
has an infinite amount of compassion
for small children uncorrupted by
the adult world, and especially for
“good old Phoebe,” his little sister, and
for some nuns he meets in a bus sta-
tion. The Catcher in the Rye is a
whimsical young adult standing in a
field of rye watching some children
playing some game. “And I’m standing
on the edge of some crazy cliff. What
I have to do, I have to catch everybody
if they start to go over the cliff...
That’s all I'd do all day. I'd just be
the catcher in the rye and all. I

 

know its crazy, but that’s the only
thing I’d really like to be.”

There are no wild trips to the bull-
fights in Spain here, nor bathtub gin
parties or coffeehouses, only the new
heroism of moral acuteness and sensi-
tivity. To skeptics and elders this may
seem a stirle conformity, but if they
will read Salinger they will find it is
anything but that.

 

Craven Travels Home;

Asked About Football

(Continued from page 2)

Where is all that good old col-
lege humor now that we’re winning?
All those remarks on Saturday af-
ternoon turned into school spirit.
Instead of kicking the team while it
was down we actually came close to
carrying it around on our shoulders
like a group of KA pledges. Next
year, if this trend continues, we'll
probably start attacking the goal
posts and going to out-of-town
games.

I realize that this commentary might
be out of season but I’ve written it
anyway in hopes that the same illness
won’t strike us in the event of a win-
ning basketball team. And one symp-
tom has already appeared in the form
of that 6-6 player. The faculty com-
mittee, in the interest of the student
body, should bar that boy from com-
petition, and while on the subject
should limit all teams to no more than
five victories.

Let’s nip this thing in the bud and
get back to Bud.

 

There will be a general business
meeting of the U.C.A. at 7 p.m. Tuesday
night in the Student Union. Constitu-
tional changes will be voted upon and
decisions made about next year’s Uni-

ing members are urged to attend.

IFC Songfest to Be Dec. 9

The annual IFC Song Fest will be
held in Lee Chapel on Friday, Dec.
9, at 8 p.m.

First prize, a handsome silver cup,
was taken by Sigma Nu in last year’s
competition. This year in addition to
that first prize, a fine second prize
will be awarded to the runner-up.

Don Partington will act as master
of ceremonies at the Fest, and the en-
trants will be judged by Dr. Borden,
Dr. Stephenson and Mr. Stewart.

Thus far, the response to the Fest has
been very good as there are now ten
entrants. Each vocal group will sing
two numbers, one of which may be a
fraternity song.

All are urged to attend the Song
Fest, and a most enjoyable evening is
assured to all comers.

 

Notices

There will be a discussion on “Dra-
ma and Its Place in Worship” Sunday
Dec. 4, at 2:30 p.m. in the Episcopal
Church. The discussion will be led by
members of the drama team of Union
Theological Seminary, Richmond. This
will be sponsored by the U.C.A.

Dr. T. P. Hughes, associate profes-
sor of history, will speak Sunday eve-
ning, 6:30 p.m., at the Wesley Foun-
dation. His topic will be “God’s Reve-
lation in Recent History.”

One of the most interesting stories
of Magdalen is that of Dr. Ellerton
who discovered that one of the gar-
| goyles of the main quad was the

|i image of himself, the sculptor hav-

ing been bribed by an undergraduate

to fashion the resemblance. Ellerton
at once ordered the gargoyle to be
defaced and scarified. Years later, in
venerable old age, he was horrified
to find that he had grown again to
resemble the statute.
