IFC Approves Plan For Hell

 

Tulane Professor Tells Audience

Philosophy Pervades 20th Cent.

By STEVE HENRY

Professor James K. Feibleman of
Tulane University, speaking here
under the sponsorship of the Glas-
gow Endowment Fund, told a duPont
Auditorium audience last night that
philosophy is the dominant force
acting on modern society.

The human mind, said Feibleman,
has four great routes of inquiry—
religion, art, science, and philoso-
phy—and of these philosophy plays
the most important single role.

“Without philosophy, we have
no institutions of any kind—gov-
ernments, no educational systems,
no nothing. There has got to be an
accepted philosophy behind every-
thing we believe.”

“Communism for example, is just
another philosophy, but it is a phil-
osophy made efficient by force in
both Russia and China. And this is
only one example of the power of
philosophy in today’s society.”

“It prevails in every institution,
and is just plain unavoidable for
any of us.”

Fiebleman was lecturing on the
“Importance of Philosophy,” a
subject too broad for the short time
he was allowed. But he held his
audience with a series of philo-
sophic anecdotes and a generous
helping of 20th century “sick hu-
mor.”

“The fundamental question is
how and why we came about,” said
Fiebleman. “Now I don’t think any-
one can really hope to answer that,
and especially not me. Once, some-
one asked Buddha six great philo-
sophical questions about the why and
how of mankind, and he said in so

 

many words, ‘How in Hell should I
know?”

“I guess if I were going to be
anything, Fiebleman said, “I'd have
to be a Buddhist.”

“Once upon a time,” Feibleman
said, “I saw a man die—the first
dead man I had ever seen, I asked
my mother if that was going to
happen to me some day, and when
she said it was, I decided I wanted
to go back where I had come from
in the first place.”

“But mother said, ‘That’s impos-
sible! Run along and play.’ and that’s
worried me ever since.”

He then defined existentialism,
saying that a true follower of this
philosophy is not aware of his own
reality until he “is nauseated and in
a state of profound doubt.”

“One existentialist wrote a book
named Nausea. I read it, but I found
the philosophy more appealing than
the title.”

Then he apologized for his jibes.
“T hope there aren’t any existen-«

tialists out there tonight,” he said.
“Also, I hope there are no tomatoes
or eggs.”

Prof. Feibleman got his points
across in a funny manner.

“We've go to quit making philoso-
phy an out for failure. ‘Taking some-
thing philosophically’ is a ridiculous
expression, especially when applied
to failure.”

“Philosophy only wants to refine
the problems of life, and not answer
all the unsolvables men can dream
up.”

“If philosophy can get complacent
men to quit taking too much for
granted, then half the battle is won.”

 

Home Edition To Handle Returns
In WREL Broadcasts Tonight

Home Edition, Washington and Lee
University’s nightly news show, will
handle all election news for the lo-
cal radio station, WREL tonight.

A 17-man staff will begin broad-
casting at 7:30 tonight from the Uni-
versity’s studios located in Payne
Hall. The staff has been divided into
two teams—one for the national
election and another for Virginia
and local election news.

David Goller, senior PEP, Home
Fdition News Director, said an
election scoreboard will be kept
by the staff in the journalism room
of Payne Hall (Payne 6) for stu-
dents who wish to watch the elec-
tion returns come in.

In addition to receiving election
returns from the Journalism depart-
ment’s Associated Press wire serv-
ice, students will also collect and
compile local election returns. Roy
Goodwin, KA junior, will be in

 

charge of collecting the local re-
turns.

Arrangements have also been
made for Virginia Senator A. Willis
Robertson, of Lexington, to par-
ticipate in the broadcast. Senator
Robertson is up for re-election this
year and has no major opposition.

Goller said that in addition to
giving election returns various mem-
bers of the staff will interpret the
returns from various parts of the
country in order to give listeners a
complete picture of the election.

Members of the Home Edition staff
participating in the special election
night show include: David Goller,
Roy Goodwin, Harvey Allen, Bruce
Whethan, Paul Gilbert, Howard
Schram, Steve Parel, Jerry Verlin,
Spud Slater, Jon C. Peterson, Clar-
ence Renshaw, Jay Ganong, Gene
Hulber, Bob Sykes, Peter Blakeslee,
Dick Kelly, Howard Hammersley,
and Bob Diehl.

Guild Presents Symphony, Pianist
Stewart’s Arrangement Included

By RICHARD CRUSE

The Washington and Lee Concert
Guild will present two concerts be-
fore the Christmas holidays.

On Saturday, Nov. 19, in Doremus
Gymnasium the Concert Guild will
present the Atlanta Symphony Or-
chestra, Henry Sopkin—conductor.
The Atlanta Orchestra’s program will
include “Prelude for Strings” by
W&L Fine Arts Professor Robert
Stewart.

The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra,
is ranked among the twenty-five
major orchestras of America,
Under the dynamic leadership of
Henry Sopkin, the Atlanta Sym-
phony Orchestra extends is varied
activities far beyond its home city
to the concert centers of the seven
Southeastern states.

Henry Sopkin falls into a some-
what elite group of American-born
musicians who are conductors of
major symphonies. Only nine of the
30 major orchestras in the United
States employ Americans on the po-
dium.

Mr. Sopkin has been in Atlanta for
the past 15 years and he is credited
with having built the orchestra he
conducts up to its present high sta-
tus. He has served for several years
on the faculty of the Georgia State
College in Atlanta. For several sea-
sons he was on the faculty of Po-
mona College, Claremont, Califor-
nia.

Sopkin has more than 200 works
for orchestra published in his name
and has done work from time to
time for most of the major publish-
ing houses. He is a member of the

National Honorary Music Fraternity,
ASCAP, and a National Patron of

On Dec. 6 Michel Block will give
a piano recital in Lee Chapel. He
will play Partita IV in D Major by
Bach, Sonata in B Minor by Liszt,
Kinderscenen-Op. 15 by Schu-
mann, Trois Movements de Pe-
trouchka by Stravinsky.

Michael Block was born in 1937
in Antwerp, Belgium, of French par-
ents. He now lives in Mexico City
where he made his debut with the
Mexican National Symphony Orches-
tra at the age of 16, playing three
concerts in one evening.

Sullins—W &L Glee Clubs

The Washington and Lee and Sul-
lins College Glee Clubs performed
the first of two joint concerts at
Doremus Gymnasium here last night.

The concert featured perform-
ance by the two clubs of Bruck-
ner’s Te Deum. The nineteenth
century liturgical composition is
considered one of the finest ec-
clesiastical works ever produced.
Ranging from the sweetly flowing
“Salvum Fac Populum” to the fiery
“Te Deum” chorus, it provides a
supreme test for the diversified
voices and moods of a large chorus.
The concert also featured arrange-
ments by the Sullins group of both
spirited and nostalgic tunes. Wash-
ington and Lee’s sixty male voices,
led by Professor Robert Stewart,
sang a mixed program featuring most
of the same pieces they sang here in
the Parents’ weekend concert.

Troub’s Comedy
A Popular One

By ANDY LEONARD

The Troubadours believe their
fellow students are in for a special
treat when they see Christopher
Fry’s “The Lady’s Not for Burning,”
to be presented Nov. 16-18. Dr.
Cecil D. Jones, the new Troub di-
rector, has selected it as the sea-
son’s first show, convinced that it is
the responsibility of the Troubs to
perform for the students plays of
the highest quality, both classical
and modern. He will not select plays
merely for their popularity.

“The Lady’s Not for Burning” is
not an old play as many seem to
think. In fact, its New York opening
took place exactly ten years ago
last night, with the original London
cast headed by John Gielgud, Pamela
Brown, and Richard Burton. It is a
comedy in verse about a witch hunt
in fifteenth century England. The
frightened and superstitious Mayor
of the town, Hebble Tyson, is de-
termined to burn the _ supposed
witich, Jennet Jourdemayne, whether
guilty or not. The complication comes
when Thomas Mendip, an ex-soldier,
arrives and demands to be hanged in
order to divert attention from Jen-
net.

The play is technically excellent.
Fry’s lines are beautiful, meaning-
ful, and very funny. He manages to
compare things that have never been
compared before and he gives his
characters, particularly Thomas,
some hilarious off-the-cuff remarks
to make.

But “The Lady’s Not for Burning”
is more than just a comedy. It has
deeper meaning. For instance, Fry
protests strongly in the character of
Thomas against the provincial ignor-
ance of men like the Mayor, the
justice Tappercoom, and the simple
Chaplain. Jennet and Thomas come
to value life as they never had be-
fore.

Here is a tip: go to the theatre
next week to have fun, but also
listen closely. Critics disagree about
the meaning of “The Lady’s Not for
Burning.” What do you think Fry
is saying?

There will be a meeting of the

The IFC adopted the first draft of a new proposal providing
for a Help Week at Washington and Lee this year. At a meet-
ing last night the group accepted the proposal offered by the
subcommittee by a vote of 15 to 1.

The committee, designed to devise a plan to cut out Hell
Week abuses and work out the mechanics for enforcing their

K proposal, will now attempt to form
a more specific group of proposals
to be presented to the IFC. The
IFC intends to put the plans into
effect during the second semester
of this year.

IFC President Dave Lefkowitz
reminded the group that they de-
cided last spring to take this ac-
tion. After discussion in the var-
ious houses, they also decided to
take a firm and encompassing
stand as soon as possible. He said
that the committee had worked
long and hard in organizing this
proposal,

The committee includes Clinton
Anderson, SPE; Ralph Elias, PEP;
Carter Fox, KA; Ned Olds, SAE;
Stephen Paley, ZBT; and Ed Webs-
ter, Lambda Chi. They are working
in coordination with the Positive
Committee that intends to draw up
a list of specific activities that will
be allowed during the Help Week.

Lefkowitz expressed hope that the
Student Body would provide the nec-
essary support to carry the eventual
plan out successfully.

The first draft, as accepted last
night, is as follows:

Under the present fraternity sys-
tem at Washington and Lee, the
fraternities each year plan a con-
centrated program of activities for
their pledges during the first week
of the second semester. It is our be-
lief that such a week of activities
should continue to exist.

During this week, several valu-
able ends are served. First, pledges,
being engaged in a common field of
strenuous activity, develop a sense
of unity among themselves. Second,
they develop a stronger attachment
to the fraternity in laboring for it.
Third, by obeying orders from upper-
classmen, they are reminded of their
junior position in the fraternity, and
develop respect for the authority of
the fraternity as a whole.

We maintain, however, that no
pledge can increase in his respect
of any individual or group of in-
dividuals which forces him to per-
form deeds that violate his basic
sense of human dignity and de-
cency.

Moreover, we believe that no good
ends are served by submitting the
pledge to physical pain or prolonged
discomfort. By the same _ token,
schemes to cause mental or emo-
tional anguish are also undesirable.

Instead, we hold that the highest
purpose of this Help Week can be
fulfilled by occupying the pledges
with constructive projects and ac-

 

present.

W&L Traditions

There has been much talk of late concerning the “tradi-
tions” of Washington and Lee. There are those who argue that
they should be abolished except for the honor system. There are
those who reply that they must be enforced.

Traditions are not concrete things that may be abolished or
enforced. It is true that they may be encouraged or discouraged,
but tradition based on custom cannot be maintained or abol-

ished by decree.

The Southern tradition like the Southern prejudice lives on

despite adverse influence in the

and politics. These traditions have altered somewhat with the
pressures of time and law. Undoubtedly the pressures of time
and changing circumstances will alter them further.

If some school authority were to announce that the con-
ventional dress and the speaking traditions were no longer in
effect, we do not believe that the students of this institution
would stop speaking to each other or even wearing their coats
and ties. There would be that minority which is found in every
body of men that would appear on campus dressed in a sloppy
fashion. We see them now. It is because of them that we have

our Assimilation Committee.

Last week when one of our columnists suggested the aboli-
tion of these two traditions, a storm of indignation swept
through a small portion of the student body, the faculty, and
evidently the Assimilation Committee. At least one professor
was indignant enough to bring the matter up before his classes.
One senior to whom the traditions of our school are especially
dear commented on the column as a nice piece of satire. He
felt that the attack on the traditions would make students more

aware of their existence.

We ask those who would have our traditions abolished to
travel to one of our neighboring state universities and observe
the mode of dress. We feel that they will agree that our time
honored traditions are worth encouraging. We agree with them
that these traditions need encouragement. We do not think that
they have yet reached the mythical stage.

The fact that the proposal of abolition did not draw more
response is alarming. It might be attributed to the fact that no
one took the proposal seriously.

Columnist Sees Khruschev As Key
To Tensions On The World Level

By LANDON BUTLER

Premier Khruschev and his Com-
munist gang have been home for
two weeks and newspaper headlines
have returned to normal. But the
Free World is still guessing at the
motives behind the Russian leader’s
spectacular and disgraceful perfor-
mance in the General Assembly.

Khruschev has worked many years
to build up before the world an
agreeable image of himself. Why
should he suddenly have changed
his tack and resorted to the crude
behavior which he displayed in the
U.N.?

The answer seems to lie in the
fact that the Russian Premier is
walking a political tightrope at
home. In the Communist bloc of
nations, there is currently an
idealogical struggle over the “in-
evitability” of war. Khruschev
maintains that war is not inevit-
able, but that the Communist sys-
tem can win the world struggle by
its economic might.

Opposing Khruschev are the lead-
ers of the Chinese Communist gov-
ernment. They maintain, as did
Lenin, that war is inevitable as long
as capitalism and imperialism exist.

This question is not merely an
academic discussion of Communist
doctrine. Obviously, if war is in-
evitable, then war should be pre-
pared for. And if starting a war will
make it easier to win, then war
should be started.

The question then is whether
Khruschev or the Chinese shall
lead the Communist nations. The
outcome of the stuggle will have
an obvious effect on the Free
World.

Khruschev was in undisputed con-
trol until the U-2 incident. He could
boast to the folks back home of his
“friendship” with Eisenhower, and
was hopeful of a favorable settle-
ment of the Berlin question. To the
Communists, there was every indi-
cation that Khruschev was right,
that war was not inevitable.

The U-2 incident, and stiffened
U.S. policy on the question of Ber-
lin, ruined all this. To the people at
home, Krhuschev was made to look
foolish, and his only hope was to
torpedo the summit conference,

fields of economics, industry,

We hope that this is the case.

thereby saving face. But despite his
antics, the Russian premier remain-
ed weakened.

The General Assembly meeting
in New York provided the perfect
opportunity for Khruschev to re-
gain his lost strength, since the
Chinese Communists would not be
represented. Khruschev alone
would be on the stage for all the
Communist world to see.

Khruschev’s problem then was
how best to please the party mem-
bers at home. He reacted in typical
Bolshevik fashion, and attemped to
cause as much disturbance as pos-
sible.

He used the General Assembly
meeting as a show-case for his own

Rel. Week

By GERRY OUELLETTE

Tomorrow the faculty, the student
body and other interested persons
will assemble in Doremus Gymnas-
ium to initiate this year’s Religious
Emphasis Week. Following the open-
ing session, private and public con-
ferences will take place, the theme
of which will be, generally, “Reli-
gions: How and Why.”

We claim that these conferences
are beneficial. We don’t assert, how-
ever, that the intent of Religious
Emphasis Week is to “convert” any-
one. Certainly a program that fea-
tures theologians of the Jewish, Prot-
estent, and Catholic persuasions,
simultaneously, cannot be based on
conversion.

 

It has been our experience to
attend religious conferences here
and elsewhere. It has also been our
past experience to approach re-
ligious conferences with a melee
of attitudes.

Our first and most avid feeling for
religious conferences remains skept-
icism. We cannot help but suspect
that this is also the case for other
students. We don’t particularly
cherish skepticism in the partakers of
religious conferences, but we can
appreciate the part that skepticism
naturally plays when one listens to
a lecture on religion given by a man
of a different religious persuasion.
We bemoan this situation, but we
cannot say sincerely that the feeling
is ill placed.

There is another attitude which
we can assert to be very much in
bad taste during lectures on religion.
This green monster is one very much
in fashion in our beloved surround-
ings: closed-minded prejudice.

We think that the most perfect

Requires Open Mind

attend the lectures with an open-
mind in search of knowledge. We
would recommend that all stu-
dents attend the lectures with the
same attitudes that they main-
tain during any other lecture—
let the scope range from Economics
to Philosophy.

We can do nothing but praise the
members of the University Christian
Association for their work in the past
and for their efforts this year, culmi-
nating in the exciting panel which
they have arranged.

We also feel that each student
should do his part to make the
“Week” a success. The success will
be measured not by the amount of
inspiration the conference has com-
municated—this is utter foolish-
ness—but by the measure of per-
sonal knowledge the individual stu-
dent, faculty member, or other in-
terested person has added to his
store of learning.

We personally believe that this
is the intent of the University
Christian Association, presenting
this program each year, and the
University itself in endorsing the
function. Is not knowledge the sole
purpose of University and student?

May we further suggest that a
gentleman’s code be adopted for the
ensuing conference. If the student
keeps in his mind that he is after
knowledge and nothing else, we be-
lieve that this can be made practical.
The code is simply this: let the stu-
dent question the speaker on any
point that he finds questionable or
ambiguous ON THE FLOOR OF
THE CONFERENCE ROOM. This we
believe to be a more gentlemanly
procedure than the usual amateurish
rehash of the lecture (and the verbal

 

attitude with which to participate
in Religious Emphasis Week is to

“cutting of the speaker) following
the assembly.

By GEORGE BIRDSONG

World War III, a cold war between

 

propaganda, much as the Bolsheviks

hed done with the Duma in the years |

following the revolution of 1905. The
Russians would probably like very
much to destroy the United Nations,
but as the Communist bloc is not

powerful enough to make a boy-'|

cott successful, they must resort to
internal corruption. This explains
the attempt to replace the Secretary-
General with a committee. And the
premier’s behavior seems to be an-
other attempt to undermine the U.N.
from within. Khruschev, like any
good politician, was trying to please
the folks back home.

From Other
Campi

From The Sophian, Smith College,
Northampton, Mass.

 

Raymond Joel Dorius, associate
professor of English, and Edward
W. Spofford, instructor in classics,
were each given a one year sus-
pended sentence and a five hun-
dred dollar fine in Superior Court
on October 18.

The two professors were con-
victed last week on a charge of
possession of obscene pictures “for
the purpose of exhibition, loan, or
circulation.”

The two men are expected to
appeal the findings.

—Always heard Smith was a stim-

 

ulating school.

Communism and the free world, has
begun. Communism is succeeding in
many parts of the world today be-
| cause peovle like you and I don’t
try to understand Communist fronts.
Therefore, we should consider the
Communist meaning of peaceful co-
existence as it pertains to summit
conferences.

When Premier Khruschev speaks
of co-existence, what he really means
is that what he has is his, and what
we have is his to get. Peace offen-
sives are, of course, the basis of this
co-existence front, and the most ob-
vious of the Communist peaceful
overtures has probably been the
summit conference.

|

What is the Communist policy
toward summit meetings? Four
experts on Communism testified
before the Un-American Activities
Committee in 1958 that “the Krem-
lin looks upon a summit confer-
ence as another weapon in its pro-
gram of global conquest.” Mr. Mc-
Namara declared at this same time
that “in seeking an international
conference, the purpose of the
Soviet Union is not to negotiate
peace but to disarm the West in-
tellectually and psychologically.”

Perhaps we should now look for
more concrete evidence to support
these claims. An American Bar As-
sociation Committee report revealed
that during the last 25 years, the U.S.
' has had over 3400 meetings with the
Communists. These led to 52 major

 

Peace Offensive By Communists
Controls Soviet Policy On Summit

agreements, and Soviet Russia has
broken 50 of them. This is the most
deplorable record in all history for
the violation of solemn traties.

Still, if we do not feel well in-
formed on the official Communist
policy toward summit meetings, we
need only quote Nikita Khruschev
himself. He told the Communists at
the Leipzig Fair in 1959 that “you
should not take too seriously the
treaties made with the imperialists.”
This statement alone sustains the
comment Dr. Dexter Perkins made
recently in duPont Auditorium. He
maintained that Khruschev had
never gone to a summit conference
with pure _ intentions... including
the Paris Fiasco last spring.

So we see that even on an import-
ant issue like the summit confer-
ence, the Communists are insincere.
Furthermore, in 1956, Khruschev
made a statement in Warsaw which
openly reveals a disbelief in the co-
existence policy he advocates in the
U.N. “We must realize,” he told
the assembly, “that we cannot co-
exist eternally. One of us must go
to his grave....So what must be
done? We must push them.” Per-
haps more aptly stated this meant,
“we must bury them.”

I am not inferring we should never
attend another summit conference
with Khruschev, but I am suggest-
ing we must not be so naive as to
believe every agreeable statement
Khruschev makes to be a new and
sincere Communist effort to build
a fertile summit conference, or to

ington for his reply to our “tirade.”

Mr. John T. Jones President

The Houston Chronicle Publishing
Company

512 Travis Street

Houston 2, Texas

Dear John:

I am enclosing an editorial from
the student newspaper at Washing-
ton & Lee University, Lexington,
Virginia, which I consider so good
that I felt it should be brought to
your attention. If you agree with me
as to its quality and to its signifi-
cance because of its source, you
might feel that it merits reproduc-
tion.

I consider this one of the most ef-
fective and penetrating editorials for
the Nixon-Lodge ticket that I have
read but, to me it is not only the
excellent espousal of the ticket that
makes it important; equally, if not
more important, is the fact, there
evidenced, that youngsters in college
can write with such lucidity and
force and exhibit such a grasp of, and
interest in, the issues in the cam-
paign which are of lasting signifi-
cance.

As an aside, I think it will be of
interest to you to know that this
student paper is edited by one group
for its Friday Edition and an entirely
different group for its Tuesday Edi-
tion. The Friday edition favors Ken-
nedy and the Tuesday Edition fav-
ors Nixon and Lodge, so they are
having a Kennedy-Nixon debate of
their own. Probably very few votes
will be affected by these boys’ efforts,
but, certainly, this competition will
make better citizens of them and
of the student body represented. A
copy of the Friday Edition’s editorial
stand for Kennedy is also enclosed.

I would like to have these papers
back when you are through with

them. Sincerely,

Webster Unabridged

W&L Parking

Mr. Alphonse Whizz
Whizz Bicycle Co.
Peoria, Illinois

Dear Sir:

A small school in the Valley of
Virginia, with a rather affluent stu-
dent body, has a situation which
might be profitable for both of us.
Washington and Lee University
has parking spaces for 350 automo-
biles on or near campus. According,
however, to the University proctor,
there are more than 485 student-
owned cars in town, and another
100 cars registered to the faculty

‘| and administrative personnel.

As anyone who drives on cam-
pus around 10:15 can attest, the
place tends to fill up in a short
while.

Because of the peculiar topog-
raphy of this campus, there seems
to be no further room for expanding
parking areas. When construction of
the new science building begins next
spring, some existing parking spaces
will even be taken out of use.

Therefore, why not begin an in-
tensive sales drive here on behalf of
Whizz Bicycles, emphasizing the
miseries of owning a car? Your slogan
could be something like: “Why tear
your hair or rant and rave? Buy a
Whizz and save, Save, SAVE!”

You might point out that a bi-
cycle never needs gas, oil, or anti-
freeze; that a fraternity brother
will never ask to borrow it for a
trip to Lynchburg; and that a bi-
cycle is safer and considerably
faster than a car in Lexington traf-
fic.

The outstanding difference, of
course, is that a bicyclist doesn’t
have to waste 10 minutes looking for
a parking space. He can drive almost
to the door of his classroom.

Although bicycling also provides
good exercise, I wouldn’t play up this
angle, as physical fitness is a rather
sore point among P. E. students. Be-
sides, most Minks pride themselves
on the horrible shape that they’re
in.

For those students demanding
sports models, you might provide
dual chains and spinners on the
wheels. Foreign license plates would
also be desirable.

This campus would, I think, be
an excellent place for you to link
bicycling with intellectualism. (A
future ad campaign might play up
up “Whizz, the Thinking Man’s
Bicycle.”)

For this great potential market, I
would be happy to act as your agent,
with a 10 per cent commission on
each sale. I hope you will consider
this offer promptly, as I am about
to make a similar proposal to Liber-
ty Hall Stables.

Profitably yours,

Edward Webster, Jr.

W&L Shuts Out Carnegie

Keesee Stars In

Muddy Battle

Against Hard-Hitting Tartans

A 64-yard touchdown run by Tom-
my Keesee in the third quarter gave
the undefeated but once tied Wash-
ington and Lee football team a 6-0
victory over Carnegie Tech Saturday.

Keesee cut across left guard, broke
into the open, and outraced Tech’s

secondary for the TD. Joe Hess’ run!

for extra points fell short of the
gorl, but the touchdown was all
the Generals needed for their sixth
victory.

There were seven fumbles in the
geme which was played in a steady
rain, Washington and Lee fumbled
three times and lost the ball each
time. Tech recovered only one of
its four fumbles.

Lost fumbles stopped Tech drives
in Washington and Lee territory on
three occasions—on the 8, 34, and 13-
yard lines. Terry Fohs of Washing-
ton and Lee cut short another Tech
drive with an interception on the
21.

The victory marked the first time
the Generals had shut out an op-
ponent since 1953 when the Generals
wholloped Shephard 47-0. The loss
left Tech with a 3-4 mark with only
one game remaining.

The Generals’ touchdown drive
began when Keesee fell on a Tech
fumble on his own 23 yard line
early in the third quarter. Keesee

 

carried the ball two times for a

first down on the 36. Jim Russ
failed to pick up any yardage on
a run,

Then Keesee broke through left
guard and was off on his touchdown
sprint.

Tech’s best chances for a touch-
down c2me early in the first period
when Court Burrell returned a punt
60 yards to the Washington and Lee
16. Quarterback Pete Bouxsein slip-
ped through the Generals line to
the 8 on a keeper. But fullback Dale
Stewart fumbled on the next play
and Fohs fell on the ball in the
end zone for a touchback.

There were several injuries in-
flicted on the Blue and White by
the hard play of the game. Ned
Hobbs suffered a back injury and
will not be able to play in Satur-
day’s game. Lanny Butler is out
for the year with a foot injury, and
Bob Funkhouser who has had had
a kidney ailment, will not be in
the starting lineup for the rest of
the year.

Next Saturday will be the last
home game for the Generals. In ad-
dition the game against Sewanee will
be the last time eleven seniors will
play on Wilson Field. These include
Courtney Mauzy, Terry Fohs, Bill
Willes, Mal Brownlee, Graham Ful-
ton, Tom Budd, Windy Weed, Joe
Hess, Jim Russ, Tiff Tiffany, and
Bob Funkhouser.

 

Swimming Practices

The Washington and Lee swim-
ming team will meet its first oppon-
ent, Roanoke College, on Dec. 3.
Coach Norris Eastman expects to
have another winning season after
seeing the results of the time trials
held last week. The team held its
first pool workout on Nov. 1, after
having concentrated on exercises
since the middle of September.

Only three men were lost from
last year’s team which posted an
undefeated season. Nearly every
member of the current team saw
action last year and in addition
there are ten returning lettermen.

The captains of the tankmen this

year are Maury Purnell, Jim Parker,

XC Team Falls To Catawba

On last Friday afternoon the Wash-
ington and Lee cross-country team
was defeated 15-42 by Catawba Col-
lege at Salisbury, N. C.

The first five places went to the
powerful Catawba team, with Cataw-
ba runner deVictor taking the indi-
vidual first place on the flat, 4.2
mile course.

The Generals took the last five
scoring places with Shank, Williams,
Youngblood, Reynolds, and Garret-
son coming in in that order.

Bootmen Lose To Roanoke

The Washington and Lee soccer
team suffered its fourth loss of the
season by a score of 3-0 to Roanoke
College in Roanoke. Rain, a partisan
crowd and the rough play of Roanoke
upset the Generals’ attack. It is a
disappointing loss for the W&L squad
after rolling over North Carolina
State the week before.

Cloy led the Roanoke attack with
two goals and played an outstanding
game. The third Roanoke goal was

Teamwork In Tech Shutout

If we had not seen Pittsburgh
from the air we might have thought
it a small hospitable town. As it was
we knew it to be a big hospitable city.
We were treated well by all except
the weatherman and the Carnegie
football players. The former gave
us a cold, rainy day and the latter
a hard-charging, fighting football foe.

It was only a six point margin of
victory, but the big zero for our
opponent was very gratifying. We
have waited so long to see it on a
scoreboard. It took some good de-
fensive plays and a little luck to
bring of the whitewash. We inter-
cepted three Tech passes and re-

The Washington and Lee Baby
Generals finished out their 1960 grid
schedule with a 14-12 loss to Mas-

Coached by Hal Bates and Bill King
the freshmen football team posted a
respectable 3-3 for the season.

In the game Saturday, played at

yards out.

covered three Tech fumbles. The
defensive effort was led by our in-
domitable Terry Fohs, who recovered
one fumble and intercepted a pass
to shut off two of the Tartans’
thrusts. Other individuals who stood
out in the defensive effort were
Wayne Bradshaw, Doug Martin,
Dave Monroe, Steve Suttle, Tom
Budd, and on and on.

Tommy Keesee, Jim Russ, and
Charlie Gummey provided the of-
fensive striking power. It was a
beautifully executed trap play that
sent Keesee oT on his 65 yard touch-
down run. Tommy Goodwin trapped
the Tech right tackle for the key
block. And as others carried out
assignments, Keesee broke into
the clear, gaining the half-step he
needed to outrun his pursuers.

This week we play our last home
game of the season. It will be the
last appearance on Wilson Field for
eleven of our squad. Sewanee has a
very fine team, and it should be an
excellent game. See you there!

yours?

These are the silver wings of a
U. S. Air Force Navigator. As a
flying officer on the Aerospace
team, he has chosen a career of
leadership, a career that has
meaning, rewards and executive
opportunity.

The Aviation Cadet Program
is the gateway to this career. To
qualify for this rigorous and pro-
fessional training, a high school
diploma is required ; however, two
or more years of college are highly
desirable. Upon completion of the
program the Air Force encourages
the new officer to earn his degree
so he can better handle the respon-
sibilities of his position. This in-
cludes full pay and allowances
while taking off-duty courses un-
der the Bootstrap education pro-
gram. The Air Force will pay a
substantial part of all tuition costs.
After having attained enough
credits so that he can complete
course work and residence require-
ments for a college degree in 6
months or less, he is eligible to
apply for temporary duty at the
school of his choice,

If you think you have what it
takes to earn the silver wings of
an Air Force Navigator, see your
local Air Force Recruiter. Ask
him about Aviation Cadet Navi-
gator training and the benefits
which are available to a flying
officer in the Air Force. Or fill in

tivities that will test their capacity
for resourcefulness and teamwork,
without debasing them by the
practices listed previously.

Although not all of the so-called
“hazing” practices of the old Hell
Week were harmful per se, many of
them were decidedly antithetical to
the spirit of the Interfraternity Coun-
cil’s regulations. In order to pre-
vent the undesirable practices, it
may be necessary to restrict a few
non-harmful ones. Here is how we
propose that “Help Week” should
be regulated:

Regulations:
According to the present rules:

“A. No fraternity shall violate
the principles of good taste;”

“B. No initiation or pledge train-
ing activity shall constitute any
physical or emotional hazard to the
individual.”

These two rules should be inter-
preted in the light of the foregoing
Statement of Purpose, with the ad-
ditional understanding that a “haz-
ard” is clearly defined as any clear
and present danger of harm to the
physical or emotional processes.

Enforcement:

The whole Interfraternity Council
shall be ultimately responsible for
the enforcement of these rules and
the arbitration of disputes. A com-
mittee composed of the IFC member
from each fraternity shall hear and
immediately investigate all charges
of pledge training practices that vio-

foster co-existence.

Futhermore, by understanding the
summit conference as a front, a
well informed person might logically
conclude that the facts reveal, and
that the statements of Communist
prove, that although peaceful co-
existence is the cry, World War III
is the reality.

late the above rules. The committee
shall have full powers to investi-
gate, and recommend action on, vio-
lations of IFC rules alleged by any
upperclassman or any two fresh-
men. It shall hold the entire fra-
ternity chapter responsible for the
action of any of its upperclassmen.

During Help Week two represen-
tatives, not from the same frater-
nity, shall visit each fraternity house
on one of the five nights of Help
Week and then two more for the next
night and so on.

If the representative notices or
hears of any probable violation of
the above rules by a fraternity he
shall immediately notify the chair-
man of the committee and an officer
of the fraternity, and submit a writ-
ten report. This report will go to
the judicial committee of the IFC
to decide what fine will be imposed
upon the guilty fraternity, if it is
decided as such.

Tommy Keesee Is Named
Player of the Week

This week’s selection for player-
of-the-week is Tommy Keesee.
Tommy, a sophomore from Mem-
phis, Tenn., made the only touch-
down of last Saturday’s shutout
against Carnegie Tech and was

Richmond Times Dispatch.

Tommy has played a consistent
game throughout the season this
year, having the fourth highest net
rushing yardage and third highest
rushing average. The speedy full-
back has run a total of 210 yards
for an average of 4.9. In the passing
department, Keesee has received four
passes for a total of 56 yards gained.

ing his average for the day to 9.8.
In addition his touchdown play
which saved the game from a 0-0
score was a 64-yard run from scrim-
mage.

Coach McLaughlin, commenting
upon Keesee, said, “Tommy is one of
| the most promising sophomores that
| we have on the team this year. He
has played an excellent game all
season and we have great hopes for
him next year.”

In the second quarter the deter-

with a touchdown by fullback Syd
Butler after a sustained drive from
our thirty-five. Later in the same
period Massanutten roared back with
a long, forty yard pass to the W&L
one-yard line. The stubborn Baby
Generals’ defensive unit held for
two plays, but the opposing full-
back finally plunged over for the
score to give Massanutten a 14-6
halftime edge.

The third quarter saw the Wash-

in their own territory. Wet, rainy
conditions prevented quarterback

In the final quarter McDaniel took
to the air and with three minutes
remaining in the contest hit right

end zone. A pass for two extra points
and a tie failed but the Baby Gener-
als weren’t through. Mike Jenkins,
who has been carrying out the kick-
