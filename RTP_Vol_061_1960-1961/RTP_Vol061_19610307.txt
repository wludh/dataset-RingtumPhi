Troubadours’ “Henry IV”
Praised; “A Milestone”

(Editor’s Note: This is a review
of last night’s dress rehearsal of
the Troubadours’ production of
Luigi Pirandello’s “Henry IV.”
Performances begin tonight and
and continue through Friday night,
all at 8:30 p.m. at the Troub
Theatre. Tickets may be reserved
by calling HO 3-2814.

By TOM LYBASS
Tuesday Reviewer

The Troubadour’s performance of
Pirandello’s “Henry IV” is a mile-
stone in the history of W&L theatre.
Facing a play with a challenging
theme, the Troubadours have come
through with an unusually fine per-
performance.

The problem presented by Pi-
randello is a conflict between il-
lusion and reality. An_ Italian
nobleman, finding an opportunity
to escape from an unhappy life
with his treacherous brother, Titi
Belcredi, and unfaithful sweet-
heart, Marchioness Malthilda Spi-
no, at a masquerade party, pre-
tends that he is the medieval Ger-
man ruler Henry IV. For 28 years
he carried on this pretense. Fin-
ally, he is forced to unmask when
his old enemies, Tito and the Mar-
chioness Malthilda, intent upon ex-
posing him reappear at his cha-
teau with a psychiatrist. However,
in the act of unmasking himself,
Henry IV also forces the other
characters to remove their false
fronts.

What is truth? Where is it?
These questions Henry ponders.
Henry never learns the truth about
his antagonists, but he does learn
that truth is not absolute. His con-
clusion is “Truth is what you think
it is.’ Society wears a mask; indi-
viduals wear a mask. It is impossible
to be certain of anything in the
twentieth century, Henry concludes.
For this reason he imagines himself
Henry IV, living in a time about
which everything is certain and all
truth is known.

The play is alive with the action of
ideas in conflict. John Dunnell,
Frank D’Lauro and Bob Aylin,
playing Henry’s councilors, provide
the opening scene with some boister-
ous and spirited word play with
Henry’s unwilling valet, Mervin
Clay.

This first scene and the second
act allow this quartet to display

 

their talents for larking at the ex-
pense of their master. Henry is
disturbed because they have never
given serious thought to ther own
existence.

Following these comics, Tito Bel-
credi, Machioness Malthilda, and the
psychiatrist appear on stage, casting
a shadow on the peacefulness of
Henry’s home. Tito Belcredi is the
chief antagonist. Actually the cause
of Henry’s feigned madness, Tito
appears to be amused by the whole
situation. A proud, conceited man,
full of self-confidence, he sees the
whole thing as a joke. Using this
as his mask he seeks to expose
Henry. Tim Morton showed rare un-
derstanding of this part. Betty Saun-
ders, playing the Marchioness, a little
stiffly perhaps, showed, neverthe-
less, the emotion required of her
part. Jim Applebaum gave an au-
thentic characterization of the psy-
chiatrist. His guesters and actions
were typical of those students of
the human psyche.

Bob Fussell as Henry IV’s nephew
and Susan Howard as the Marchion-
ness’ daughter acted as well as
they could in rather limited roles.
Scott Iacone was on stage very lit-
tle, but still represented well Hen-
ry’s faithful servant.

Bob Allen rose to the challenge
presented in the difficult role of
Henry IV. His feigning of the mad-
ness of the real Henry IV was a
reminder of this play’s affinity to
“King Lear.” Upon Bob fell the
burden of creating an enigmatic
person, whose sanity the audience
must judge for themselves. All of
his speeches were delivered in
such a fashion as to leave no doubt
about the results of his quest for
the truth. Gestures well used and
diction clear, Allen was King
Henry IV not only in name but
also in spirit.

The stage design was most elabor-
ate. The atmosphere lent by this set
was indispensible to the general ef-
fect of the play. The lights and
curtains were for a change well
timed. Dick Roberts and Wink Mc-
Kinnon are to be commended for
their skill in executing these often
overlooked facets of stage work.
This is just one result of Trouba-
dour Director Dr. Cecil L. Jones’
drive for perfection by attention to
detail.

Sophomore Edwin L. Kerr
Awarded Physics Prize

The physics department has
awarded a copy of Dr. George Ga-
mow’s most recent book, “Matter,
Earth, and Sky,” to Edwin L. Kerr,
a sophomore, for submitting the best
explanation of the operation of a
relaxation oscillator.

During the past examination per-
iod, the oscillator was on display in
the library exhibit. Freshman and
sophomore students were invited to
submit a paper explaining the oper-
ation of the “Whatzit” as it was call-
ed. In announcing the award, Dr. E.
F. Turner of the physics department
said:

“Mr. Kerr’s paper contained a
thorough and detailed analysis of the
device. Honorable mention should al-
so be made to Mr. R. L. Cafferata,
a freshman whose paper also showed
an excellent understanding of the
oscillator.”

Kthe son of Professor Charles R. Mc-
Dowell of the law faculty. He is a
humor columnist and political re-
porter for the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch. After receiving a B.A. degree
in English here, he received an
M.S. degree from the Graduate
School of Journalism at Columbia
University.

Last year McDowell received the
National Headliners Club award for
his consistently humorous, enter-
taining, and informative columns. In
1960 he published some of the best
of his columns in the book, One
Thing After Another.

McDowell has been with the
Times-Dispatch since 1949 and has
been writing a daily humor column
for four years. He is the Virginia
political correspondent for News-
week magazine.

Dr. Myers has collaborated wth
Dr. Arnold Toynbee on one volume
of Dr. Toynbee’s A Study of History
and himself published last year Edu-
cation in the Perspective of History.
Dr. Myers’ book is a comparative
study of various civilizations’ meth-
ods of handing down the accumulat-
ed experience, knowledge and wis-
dom of humanity from generation to
generation. He employs Toynbee’s
historical framework of civilization
analysis to see how 19 societies over
the past 5,000 years have transmitted
their cultural heritages.

Dr. Myers graduated from Roa-
noke College and holds M.A. and
Ph.D. degrees from Princeton Uni-
versity. He joined the Washington

Norbert Irvine Exhibit In du Pont

By ED WEBSTER |

The current exhibition of 30 works |
of painting, collage, and sculpture by |
Norbert Irvine in the duPont gal-|
lery represents a great amount of |
versatility and talent. It certainly |
merits the distinction of being the}
first one-man show that Dr. Junkin |
has ever allowed a W&L student.

Irvine’s achievement is even more
noteworthy in view of the short time |
that he has been a practicing artist.
Three years ago he was a business
administration major. He took one
of

Dr. Junkin’s studio courses, |
changed his major to fine arts,
and began to prepare for a career
as an art teacher.

In order to fulfill the require-
ments of his new major, Irvine

stayed at W&L an extra year. He'll
graduate this June. In the mean-
time, he serves as Dr. Junkin’s as-
sistant, teaches two classes for pub-

lie school students, and continues
to experiment in artistic techniques

His current project is a large
bronze bowl, cast by the lost-wax
method. He is also engaged in cre-
ating two paintings by the process

 

of underpainting and glazing.

“T try to explore as many media
as possible,” says Irvine. “Right now
I’m trying to find a style for my-
self.”

Among the most eye-catching
features of his exhibition are sev-
en pices of welded sculpture, in
which irregular pieces of sheet
iron are brought together into
pleasing designs. For the most
part, Irvine doesn’t cut the iron
himself; he accumulates a large
pile of remnants from nearby forg-
es and blacksmiths, and sorts out
those pieces that will go well with
each other.

 

Perhaps his most successful sculp-
tures in the show, in this observer's |
|

opinion, are “Concert,” a rhythmic
series of slender crescents; and
“World’s Fair,” in which a slender |
pylon is set off by circular spaces.
In some of his painting, Irvine;
uses a process of scraping and re-

painting to achieve a_stucco-like
surface. Using only a few pigments,
he mixes and contrasts them to

achieve a surface that is very much
alive.

One of Irvine’s greatest assets,

in fact, is a fine sense of color.
His method of using small spots of
pigment to achieve a vibrant ef-
fect was partly inspired by the
French Impressionists — Monet,
Pissarro, and Bonnard, for ex-
ample—of whom Irvine is a great
admirer.

“Upstream,” a gray, green, and
blue exercise in fish-shapes, and
“Shower,” a refined but lively or-
ganization of geometrical patterns,
are two paintings especially worthy
of notice.

Usually Irvine paints from nature,
with the subject well in mind. For

instance, “Progress” and “Re-
mains”—which at first glance are
merely collection s of abstract
shapes—were actually painted al-

most unaltered from the remains of

| a demolished factory in Buena Vista.

Other works, however—such as
“Sunset” and “Sea-Forest”—started
as exercises in form and color, and
gradually grew to suggest natural
objects. “I put on a lot of titles just
to satisfy the public,” Irvine says.

Irvine, a native Lexingtonian, lives
in Hillside Terrace with his wife-
who also serves as his critic,

The Grading System

In order to encourage Washington and Lee students to
achieve one of the basic goals of education, that of individual
fulfillment, we ask for an immediate change in the present

grading system.

The change we desire is as follows: the addition of B-plus
and C-plus grades to be recorded on the student’s official trans-
cript. At the same time, we do not necessarily desire that numer-
ical credit for these grades be accounted for in the student’s

grade-point ratio.

A major reason for having a grading system of any type
is to provide some indication of a student’s achievement in
his college work. Grades are necessary so that a graduate school
admissions officer or future employer can have some aid in
measuring a student’s achievement in the past, and then relate
them to his possible potential in the future.

Under the present system, a student’s record shows little
more than a general level of achievement in a particular course.
Many situations occur where the student is discouraged from
working when he finds that there is little chance for him to re-
ceive a grade at the next higher level. Since there is such a
large difference in the amount of work necessary to achieve a
high average within a certain grade level, and since the student
knows that he will receive little more than personal satisfaction
for doing so, he becomes apathetic, and settles for a low average,
still within that same grade category. This situation is unwar-

ranted.

The student must be given incentive to work harder, and
a reward for doing so. If he knows that a plus will be affixed to
his grade if he deserves it, he will work for this. If he knows that
his chance for admission to graduate school or for employment
will be improved if he receives credit for a plus, he will feel

justly rewarded.

We realize that there are many objections to making any
major change in our present marking system and therefore offer
this simple yet basic solution. Such a change would not require
any adjustment of the number of hours required in certain four
and five hour courses. Since there would be no numerical credit
given for a plus grade, a student would be no more penalized
for taking additional hours than he presently is.

It has been argued that any additions to the grading sys-
tem would make it cumbersome, or too limiting for professors
to give true assessment of a student’s accomplishment. Many
professors, however, now give students plus grades at the
end of the semester, although the only place they appear is
outside the professor’s office, and not on the transcript where

they count.

We are also aware that some want to make a more com-
plete change than this system would allow. Nevertheless, we
must face the present situation realistically. The grade-point
ratio, is primarily an internal system used by the school to
regulate academic standards. A change in this might penalize
the student as much as it would help him, leaving him no better
off than where he started. There are certain advantages under
our present marking system, and with the proposed change,
these advantages would be maintained. In addition, our IBM
equipment can handle this revision.

Therefore, we urge that a reappraisal of the present sys-
tem, in the light of this proposal, be made. Now is the time to
promote academic excellence. Now is the time to help each
student achieve his intellectual potential, and, at the same time,

give him his due reward.

A Serious Dissertation Wherein
An Urgent Problem Is Alleviated

By STEVE HENRY

It is with deep moral and theo-
logical concern that we view a
problem currently arising in one
of the outstanding news and enter-
tainment media of our great and
sacred South.

The field to which we refer, of
course, is television. And the prob-
lem is the ever-increasing number
of non-Caucasians appearing each
day and night on the tube.

Because the average Southerner
spends a goodly portion of his wak-
ing hours sprawled in front of his
beaming picture tube, it is easy to
see that such a preponderance of
Negro entertainers and athletes is
certain to create by a process of
osmosis some highly unfavorable
sociological development on_ the
minds of the avid television fans.

Rare is the hour spent in front of
the tube during which our young
and easily twisted minds are not
exposed to such subversive, obvious-
ly Communistic propaganda as Wil-
lie Mays catching a fly ball, Oscar
Robertson shooting a jump shot,
Harry Belafonte singing a Russian
folk song, or Dr. Ralph Bunche
speaking at the United Nations.

The effect of this propaganda on
the alert, eager-to-learn young
minds of the South can be seen by
any discerning, thinking man: IT
WOULD LEAD TO INEVITABLE
INTER-MARRIAGE AND THE END
OF THE WHITE RACE AS WE
KNOW IT.

Obviously, something must be

 

tum Phi

done to halt this monster which
seeks to devour us and all that we
stand for. Responsible citizens must
take action against this unnatural
and curious phenomemon being
pushed down our throats by North-
ern politicians.

To stymie this movement, we can
no longer resort to such time-hon-
ored organizations as did our illus-
trious forefathers. The Klu-Klux
is dead; the Citizens Council is
breathing its last breath.

However, it is our belief that
something can be done, and surpris-
ingly enough can be accomplished
through use of tactics employed
until this time only by our oppon-
ents. We propose a nonviolent, dem-
onstration-type rebellion against the
tryants of television.

Non-violence has been used
against us with remarkable success.
Bitter examples are Richmond and
Lynchburg, Virginia, where we suf-
fered untimely defeats. Therefore,
for us to use the same tactics for

The Late Unpleasantness In Lynchburg

 

By JOHN PAUL

The recent sit-ins have given rise
to confusion as to the state of the
law. As an illustration of this con-
fusion consider the contrast in the
opinions of two persons of some
esteem in the Democratic party.
Eleanor Roosevelt approves of the
sit-ins, calling them “simply wond-
erful.” However, former President
Harry S. Truman has stated that,
“If anyone came to my store and
sat down, I’d throw him out... Pri-
vate business has its own rights and
can do what it wants.”

This article is intended to clarify
to some extent the legal aspects of
the sit-in movement. There will be
no attempt to deal with problems
other than those raised in a situa-
tion similar to that of the sit-in in
a Lynchburg drug store. Thus, fed-
eral jurisdiction over interstate com-
merce is not brought in and the legal
questions are somewhat restricted.

A sit-in is defined for our purpose
as a quiet, orderly refusal to leave
the premises of a restaurant or
lunch counter by persons who have
been refused service by the pro-
prietor and whom the proprietor has
asked to leave.

The Virginia criminal trespass
statute (Va. Code Section 18.1-173)
has been on the books for years. In
1960 the legislature (in anticipation
of sit-ins?) raised the maximum
fine and jail sentence to one thou-
sand dollars and twelve months re-
spectively. The gist of the statute is
that if a person purposefully enters

Dr. Fred C. Cole, President
Washington and Lee University
Lexington, Virginia

Dear Dr. Cole:

Yesterday’s Washington Post car-
ried a summary of a speech made
by Graham Morison at the recent
ODK Assembly. The Post’s story in-
dicated that Mr. Morison was high-
ly critical of the conservative ele-
ments in Virginia politics and ex-
tolled “liberal” views of government.

As an alumnus of the University
who emphatically disagrees with Mr.
Morison’s reported remarks, may I
express the hope that an opportuni-
ty will be found for an advocate
of conservative principles of govern-
ment to address the Student Body?

If you have no objection, I would
appreciate your delivering this letter
to The Ring-tum Phi for possible
publication. I would like the Student
Body to know that there are alum-
ni, and I would guess that they are
in the great majority, who feel that
the trend toward the welfare state
in disregard of constitutional princi-
ples threatens the basic rights and
liberties of all Americans.

With warmest personal regards, I

such a person is guilty of a mis-
demeanor and punishable by fine or
imprisonment.

There are also two recently en-
acted statutes providing that it is a
misdemeanor either to instigate a
erson to commit an unlawful tres-
pass or to conspire to do so.

It should be emphasized that these
statutes embody the present exist-
ing law on the question in the State
of Virginia. The constitutionality
of such laws has never been denied
by a court of justice sitting any-
where in the United States. Those
who indulge in sit-ins are simply
violating the law as it exists at
present.

However, those who do violate
this trespass statute in sit-ins con-
tend, perhaps justifiably, that the
law, though constitutional on its
face, is unconstitutional in applica-
tion when it lends itself to the en-
forcement of racial discrimination.

Legal Contentions Raised

The participants in a sit-in may
raise in their favor the following
arguments:

(1) At common law an inn-keeper
had a duty to take in all who could
pay and were not drunk or dis-
orderly if he had space. This con-
tention fails in the situation under
discussion because a restaurant or
lunch counter, without facilities for
lodging, is not an inn.

(2) The sit-in participants also

 

have raised the proposition that the

Senator Goldwater is a unique and
colorful man. He is unique because
he is a statesman among politicians.
He is colorful because his life, both
past and present, has been exciting.
He has the distinction of being the
only member of Congress with a
command pilot’s rating as a Briga-
dier General in the United States
Air Force Reserve. He has called
Walter Reuther, President of the
United Auto Workers and Gold-
water’s deadly enemy, the “most
dangerous man in America today.”
He helped build the first radio sta-
tion in Phoenix, he has navigated
700 miles along the Colorado River
in a wooden boat, has flown Army
fighters across the Atlantic, and has
written a best selling book, The
Conscience of a Conservative.

Goldwater’s politics have been
consistently conservative. He be-
lieves that there exists a bascially
conservative feeling within all
Americans.

Goldwater feels that the country
has long been ready to support a
conservative candidate willing to
take a stand on these issues:

farm price support, and the labor
monopoly.

2. To champion the state rights
cause in the field of education.

By GERRY OUELLETTE

Once before, in the form of a
rebuttal, we took a public stand on
what we thought was the function
of the Troubadour Theatre at W&L.
With the first presentation tonight of
Pirandello’s Henry IV, it would be
appropriate to reiterate this position.

In the past the Troubadours have
brought to this campus a variety of
productions, some of which appar-
ently disappointed a few students
(and professors). These few com-
plained that the play they had wit-

the benefit of us all. However, we

owner of a private business having
once invited the general public into
his place of business may not dis-
criminate against persons on the ba-
sis of race. This argument is built
on the words of Justice Black in
the case of Marsh v. Alabama (1946):

“Ownership does not always mean
absolute dominion. The more an
owner, for his advantage, opens up
his property for use by the public
in general, the more do his rights
become circumscribed by the statu-
tory and constitutional rights of
those who use it.”

However, this line of reasoning
has not been enlarged to include
restaurants within the scope of the
public facilities cited by Mr. Justice
Black.

(3) The most forceful argument
that the sit-in participants may em-
ploy has yet to be ruled upon by
the Supreme Court. This is the argu-
ment that the use of law and law
enforcement procedures to prosecute
for criminal trespassing persons ar-
rested for sitting-in constitutes ac-
tion on the part of the state which
is unconstitutional as a violation of
the equal protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.

This contention, based on the
reasoning used by the Supreme
Court in deciding the case of Shelley
v. Kraemer (1948), would seem to
be that a restaurant owner may re-
fuse to serve Negroes but that when
he utilizes the police power of the
state to eject or prosecute them the

 

Fourteenth Amendment comes in to

proposals? Obviously, there exists
no positive policies towards them.
Yet Goldwater feels that Kennedy is
“now showing signs of carrying out
what he told Southern voters, name-
ly, that he would accept the Demo-
cratic platform in order to get nom-
inated, but that he would not carry
out its provisions.”

However, no conservative opposi-
tion to Kennedy’s subdued radical-
ism has yet arisen. Goldwater be-
lieves strong opposition will arise,
and adds that “conservatives must
formulate positive programs and
proposals for action.” Verbal criti-
cism of radicalism has been all that
conservatives have thus far offered.

Wherein does sufficient national
power lie to promote action? This is
the question which faces the op-
ponents of extreme liberalism, “the
spirit of which is liberty” as one col-
lege newspaper termed it.

At present, there are two great
conservative bodies now existing
in the United States. These are the
conservative Republicans and the
Southern Democrats. A coalition be-
tween these powers could be the
force needed to launch a nation-
wide campaign for a conservative,
or at least moderate, government.
Each of these forces must be willing
to make concessions if any real
movement on a national basis is to
begin.

Barry Goldwater stated in the
National Review that “the best hope
of winning is to continue to get

 

young leaders in the South who are

should not forget, particularly when
the matter relates to a possible art
medium, who we are and for what
purpose we are here.

The theatre can be a means of
entertainment; but it can also be so
much more. Obviously the people
who run the State and Lyric are
better disposed and equipped to
entertain us, if this is our aim. How-
ever, if our theatre is made to be-
come solely and primarily a means
of entertainment, it is, in our esti-
mation, being prostituted.

As we see it. the Troubadour
Theatre should be a further ele-
ment in our education.

There should be no question in
~w minds whether we should or

Legal Contentions Arise From Sit-Ins

force as a bar to such “state action.”
It has been contended that the
licensing of resturants by the states
also constitutes “state action.”

Thus far these contentions have
not met with much success. The
leading case at the moment is one
determined by the Supreme Court
of North Carolina and which was
not appealed further. It was argued
by the Negro defendants that “state
action” existed in the enforcement
by the North Carolina courts and
police officials of a criminal tres-
pass statute through which private
discrimination was effected. Reject-
ing this contention, the court held
no “state action” was discernible in
the enforcement of such a statute.
Private conduct alone constituted the
discrimination and the Fourteenth
Amendment does not restrict merely

rivate conduct.

The problem here is at what point
apparently private acts become
“state action” through court enforce-
ment. This question will ultimately
be presented to the Supreme Court.
On the basis of precedent there is
enough latitude for the Supreme
Court to decide either way. Another
factor which may have some bearing
upon determination of the Court is
that if state action is found in the
enforcement of the trespass law,
restaurant owners may be forced to
enforce their discrimination by “self-
help” which is certainly not con-
ducive to an orderly and peaceful
society.

Senator Goldwater Looks To The South |
For Leaders In New Conservative Effort

dedicated and who will work as they
have been working. Conservaties
should work within the framework
of the Republican Party to the end
that delegates, precinct committee-
men, and so on, are of the conserva-
tive mind.”

This is a small concession for
Southerners to make. The South
should forget that Daddy and
Grandaddy voted against the Repub-
licans because they were all carpet-
baggers and scalawags. The South,
with its “young leaders,” should
forget ancient political animosities.

The conservative Republicans, who
hold great power outside of the
South and particularly in the West,
must be willing to ally themselves
with the Southern Democrats. These
men perhaps believe that southern
conservatism is based upon big-
otry and prejudice. This, however,
is not now the case, and conserva-
tives of the North and West must
realize it. Only when these two great
forces are firmly allied can real
progress to conservatism be made.

But what of a leader for this
now hypothetical force? Washing-
ton and Lee men saw the potential
leader of this force last Wednes-
day night. Barry Goldwater has the
integrity, the personality, the in-
tellect, and the judgment to lead
a consolidation of conservative
power on a national basis.

All conservatives should place
their political standards in one camp.
They have their leader and should

 

rally to him.

Troubadour Theatre Seen As Avant-Garde Group

should be a matter of personal ob-
ligation.

We should as students want to at-
tempt to discern behind the produc-
tion the element of creative genius.
A respect for the tradition of art in
the theatre is not an empty formal-
ity. “It is the recognition on the part
of the audience that imagination,
content, and form are necessary in
any work of art, and that it is not
granted to everyone to possess these
qualities,” so says Professor Oreste
F. Pucciani.

The Troubadour Theater offers us
a chance to momentarily place aside
all the incidentals of a dollar and
cents environment. “All values, even
human values, are subordinated to
the central task of creation: an at-
titude that can exist only in a society
in which art itself constitutes a
positive value,” Pucciani adds in his
description of the French Theatre.
And this, we believe, can be true of
the Troubadour in our W&L society,
if only those individuals in the so-
ciety will realize the importance of
such sentiments.

We would like to visualize our
university theatre as an American
avant-garde theatre. In such a
theatre the production lies most im-

 

portant, and this is certainly con-

Oxford & Cambridge L-X Teams To Play Here

Ist Visit In U.S.
For English

By RANDY COLE

The Washington and Lee lacrosse
team will play host to the com-
bined Cambridge and Oxford team
as the British students begin their
tour of America on March 24. The
Generals are the first team on a
schedule which includes such pow-
ers as Army, the University of Vir-
ginia, and Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity. This will be the first time a
foreign country has sent a team to
America for competition in lacrosse

Actually this is not the first time
that an exchange has taken place
between an American and a foreign
team. In 1956 the Generals went to
England and played a similar com-
bined team of Cambridge and Ox-
ford beating them by a 14-3 score. In
1958 Johns Hopkins traveled to Eng-
land and played this same team
winning by a large margin. Plans are
being formulated for an Australian
team to compete in America next
year, but as of yet, nothing is defi-
nite. A combined W&L-UVa. la-
crosse team toured Australia in the®
summer of 1959.

This combined team will repre-
sent about the best brand of col-
lege lacrosse in England and will
vie against most most of the tap}
teams in the U.S. Washington and’
Lee is considered to be within the
top twenty ranked teams in this
country.

The English team will arrive in the
States on March 21 in New York
City and will then travel to Annapo-
lis to practice. It will arrive in Lex-
ington on March 23 in time to watch
the Generals open their season
against Maryland. The following day
they will play the Generals here.

There are differences between the
British rules for lacrosse and those
under which Americans usually
compete. In England a team plays
twelve men and there are no sub-
stitutions during the game. They
have little equipment and lack such
essentials as helmets and knee pads.
In America a team fields eleven men
and substitutions are permitted up to
a specified number. When American
teams travel to England we play
under their rules, and thus they
will follow ours during their tour.

Concerning the Generals’ chances !
in this contest, Coach Bob McHenry |
feels that “we were a much better ;

Swimmers Finish Successful Season

By BRIAN DORSK

{ sWashington and Lee’s swimming
team closed out its first season under
Coach Norris Eastman with a re-
sounding 54-32 win over Norfolk
Division of William and Mary. The
meet took place in the Doremus
Gym pool on Monday, Feb 27. After
being pitched into the pool by the
jubilant swimmers, Coach Eastman
emerged pleased with the times
turned in by his swimmers and the
final team record of six wins and
four losses.

The victories were won over
Roanoke College, UVa., Catholic
U., Georgetown U., Wake Forest,
and Norfolk Division of W&M.
The losses were to West Va. U.,
Maryland, American U., and East
Carolina College. The Generals
scored a total of 509 points on the
season compared to 431 for their
opponents,

The Generals swimmers were un-
defeated in the 50 yard freestyle.
Co-captain Jim Parker won the
event in all ten meets. In the 200
breaststroke the Generals were also
the masters as Elliott Maynard won
ten straight. These two events were

Once again this year, the Gener-

ames. They pley such schools as

the hands of the Marines and Cor-| and George Washington from the

nell due to lack of practice on rou-
tine plays that could have been|
worked on outdoors, and especially |
due to a lack of batting practice. |
This curse lasted through the re-|
mainder o fthe season. The team as|
a unit was just beginning to jell,
when the season closed with a 13)
inning, 1-0 victory over West Vir-|
gbinia. The season’s record for the
Generals was 3-16.

This year’s team promises to im-
prove upon that record. The Gener-
als suffered no losses due to gradu-
ation, and the only regulars who
won't be back are Mike Monier, first
base, who’s nursing a broken ankle,
and right fielder Dennis McKay, who
transferred at the end of last semes-
ter.

Returning lettermen include
catcher Jim Russ, pitcher Roy Car-
penter and Phil Sharp (who won
all of last year’s victories), second
baseman Park Gilmore, team captain
Ned Hobbs at shortstop, Chuck Lane
at third base, and outfielders Bobby
Williams and Robin Wood. Other re-
turning veterans of last year’s cam-
paign are catcher Keith Carr, sec-
ond baseman Buck Rose, and out-

team they lost to 4-3 in 10 innings
last year, due to a bad-hop ground
ball), East Carolina College, and a

replaces the Parris Island Marines,
who dropped all sports.

This year’s freshman class sup-

four pitchers, with third baseman
Chuck Lane occasionally doing late
inning relief duty. This year there
are six freshmen working out on

handers, a non-existent commodity
on last year’s team. Southpaws Brice
Gamber, Bill Marmion, and Ed Nor-
ton are all trying for positions on
the squad, along with several right-
handers.

There are also freshmen and up-
perclassmen out for the first time
trying for every other position on the
field, so Coach Lyles should have
a deep bench to work with this year.

“Tell me,” he cried, “are you a girl of expensive tastes?”

“No, hey,” she cried, “I am a girl of simple tastes.”

“Good,” he cried, “for my cruel father sends me an allowance
barely large enough to support life.”

“Money does not matter to me,” she cried. “My tastes are
simple, my wants are few. Just take me riding in a long, new,
yellow convertible and I am content.”

“Goodbye,” he cried, and ran away as fast as his chubby little
legs could carry him, for he had no convertible, nor the money to
buy one, nor the means to get the money, short of picking up his
stingy father by the ankles and shaking him till his wallet
fell out.

He knew he must forget this girl but, lying on his pallet at the
dormitory, whimpering and moaning, he knew he could not.

At last an idea came to him: though he did not have the money
to buy a convertible, perhaps he had enough to rent one!

Hope reborn, he rushed at once to an automobile rental
company and rented a yellow convertible for $10 down plus 10¢
a mile, and with many a laugh and cheer drove away to pick
up the girl.

“Oh, goody,” she said when she saw the car. “This suits my
simple tastes to a ‘T’. Come, let us speed over rolling highways
and through bosky dells.”’

And away they drove. All that day and night they drove and
finally, tired but happy, they parked high on a windswept hill.

“Marlboro?” he said.

“Yum yum,” she said.

They lit up. They puffed with deep contentment. “You
know,” he said, “you are like a Marlboro—mild and fresh
and relaxing.”

“But there is a big difference between Marlboro and me,” she
said, ‘because I do not have a Selectrate filter nor do I come
in soft pack or flip-top box.”

They laughed. They kissed. He screamed.

“What is it, my dear,” she cried, alarmed.

“Look at the speedometer,” he said. ““‘We have driven 200
miles and this car costs 10¢ a mile and I have only $20 left.”

“But that’s exactly enough,” she said.

“Yes,” he said, “but we still have to drive home.”

They fell into a profound gloom. He started the motor and
backed out of the parking place.

“Hey, look!” she said. ‘“The speedometer doesn’t move when
youre backing up.”

He looked. It was true. “Eureka!” he cried. “That solves my
problem. I will drive home in reverse. Then no more miles will
register on the speedometer and I will have enough money
to pay!”

“T think that’s a marvelous idea,” she said, and she was right.
Because today our hero is in the county jail where food, clothes
and lodging are provided free of charge and his allowance is
piling up so fast that he will have enough money to take his girl
riding again as soon as he is released.

Solution For Urgent Problem

our own purpose, is to create a
stroke of pure genius, to beat the
enemy at its own game, so to speak.

For a beginning, we suggest that
interested citizens begin immediate
negotiations with their local tele-
vision station owners. The request
should be simple and straightfor-
ward, namely that local stations
carry no more network programs
which feature any non-Caucasian
entertainment.

If this fair and well-meant plea
were not accepted, then we must
resort to the inevitable sit-in. With
the aid of local ministers, public
officials, and co-eds from the various
state universities, the South could
begin its return to normalcy. It is
our purpose here to outline a few

ceivable in our case. Further, artis-
tic and intellectual values should
balance questions of entertainment;
the avant-garde is the opportunity
to experiment in the real of the
theatre as an art form. Through such
a theatre, dramatic techniques evolve
and change, and dramatic art pro-
gresses.

Because a medium of art such as
the avant-garde theatre is can only
persist through the total devotion of
the artists to the cause of pure art,
an unrealistic view in the work-a-
day world in which we will live
after graduation, our American so-
ciety offers little chance for its suc-
cess. In our case, however, the art
theatre can do very well, for in a
sense it lies beyond the trials and
tribulations of the professional.
We can have our art and prosper in
it too.

of the actions which could be taken
on the local level to correct the
present abominable situation.

1. A boycott of all network tele-
vision programs. This could be ac-
complished very simply; no one
would turn on his television set. At
one master stroke, therefore, we
could eliminate the direct source of
the unfavorable propaganda.

2. A boycott of all firms, both lo-
cal and national, which advertises on
the local station. Of course, this
might result in certain inconven-
iences for the average person, but
the individual must be considered
expendable in such an_ earth-
shaking movement.

3. And most important. A sit-in
must be staged at the local televi-
sion station. Members of the most
prominent families must take part in
these demonstrations for any degree
of success to be achieved. Once
these prominent agitators are thrown
in jail for trespassing, indignation
will be so wide-spread among the
town’s citizenry that the original
boycott will be totally successful.
Judging from the results acquired
by the opposition using these same
tactics, our mission would soon be
accomplished. The local station
would have to provide its viewing
audience with programs suitable for
public consumption.

The medium, void of sports, music,
and all except the most trivial local
news, will be vastly improved. The
Negro will be banned (except of
course, in re-showing of Gone with
the Wind) and our heritages and
traditions will once again have been
upheld against overpowering odds.

pect everybody to improve. Ned
Hobbs, who’s a real fine ballplayer,
should improve both in the field and
at bat. Robin Wood in center is one
of the best defensive players I
know, and I look for him to improve
at bat. We have a good double play
combination in Hobbs and Gilmore,
but the lack of experience at first
base will hurt. Right now Bob Funk-
houser seems to have the inside
track there due to his hustle.”

QUICK SERVICE

States have teams, and the game is
beginning to catch on in other coun-
tries.

The British team has to pay for
its own expenses to come to and play
in America and as a result Wash-
ington and Lee has guaranted them
a nominal fee. The ticket price will
be only $1 per person and Coach
McHenry hopes that most of the stu-
dents will turn out for the game to
“support the team and watch a real
fine ball game.”

THE SATISFIER

‘This king wrote the book on flavor. Every satisfying
puff is A/r-Softened to enrich the flavor and

make it mild. Special porous paper lets you draw
fresh air into the full king length of top-tobacco,
straight Grade-A all the way.
