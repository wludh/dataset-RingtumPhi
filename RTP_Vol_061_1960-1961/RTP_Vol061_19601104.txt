mance languages at Washington and
Lee University, has been named a
professor emeritus by the univer-
sity’s Board of Trustees.

Sazeracs Select
Tartt, Wilson

The Sazeracs, Washington and
Lee’s informal student singing
group, have selected freshman Jo
Tartt, SAE, and Eric Wilson, Delt,
as new members.

Huntley Biggs, president of the
group, stated that more than 20
boys tried out for the two openings.
He said that there will be another
audition in the spring to fill the
spaces that will be vacated by the
graduation of five seniors.

Last year, the 13-man group went
to Florida where they were the
guests of the Colonnade Hotel. Dur-
ing their stay, they presented con-
certs at the hotel and the near by
Tequesta Country Club. Last year
was the third consecutive year that
the Sazeracs were guests of the
Colonnade Hotel.

This year they have similar plans
along with other formal and infor-
mal profesisonal engagements. There
will also be a few volunteer ap-
pearances by the group.

Included in the Sazeracs are Hen-
ry Harrell, Billy Martin and Hardie
Karr, Sigma Chi’s; Bud Lee, Sigma
Nu; Cal deColigny, Beta; Huntley

Dunnell Has Lead Role

In Troub’s Opening Play*,

By ANDY LEONARD
Troub Publicity Agent

Male actors will dominate the stage
of the Troub Theatre in Christopher
Fry’s “The Lady’s Not for Burning.”
Eight of the eleven players in the
cast are W&L students, and they are
now hard at work rehearsing for
opening night, Nov. 16.

The play is a comedy in verse
set in the fifteenth century which
demands the services of a domin-
ant protagonist to carry the action.
Dr. Cecil D. Jones, Troubadour fac-
ulty director, has found him in
John Dunnell. Dunnell has shown
the ability to handle the difficult
characterization of Thomas Mendip,
a moody, cynical ex-soldier. He is
quickley mastering Christopher Fry’s
poetry and is expected to excite his
audiences.

Different Character

Two very different characters
share the spotlight with John. Dick
Roberts will handle the part of
Richard, a lowly orphaned clerk ele-
vated by the throes of first love,
while his master, the Mayor Tyson,

 

will be portrayed by the talented
Bob Allen. His controlled comical
voice and his perfect timing are
guaranteed to delight onlookers as
they have in the past.

To play the Devise brothers, Nich-
olas and Humphrey, Dr. Jones has
selected two distinctive, Ron Alen-
stein and Firth Spiegel. Tall and
dark, Firth, as Humphrey, directs
a slow, deep voice of disdain at his
brother, Nicholas. The shorter, light-
haired Ron replies with a sharp,
sarcastic voice just to irritate and
ridicule Humphrey. It is easy to
understand why they almost come
to blows.

Three character parts round out
the male roles in “The Lady’s Not
for Burning.” Merv Clay portrays
the portly justice, Tappercoom, en-
grossed in legalities and pomposity.
Andy Leonard plays the simple-
minded Chaplin, an unfavorable
symbol of the clergy. The small
role of the drunk, Skipps, will be
taken by Tim Morton. However,
Morton’s contribution to the show
is twofold. As Stage Manager he is
Dr. Jones chief production assistant.

the respondence side of the case:
National Labor Relations Board v.
Blackheart Insurance Company.

Alternates to the team are Ray-
mond Robrecht, senior law student
from Plainfield, N. Y.; William
Moore, intermediate law student
from Norfolk, Va.; and Joseph
Spivey, III, intermediate law sut-
dent from Raleigh, N. C.

The team will face the moot court
team from the University of Virginia
which will take the petition side of
the case and argue against the
Minks.

Other law schools which are
members of this region include the
University of North Carolina, Uni-
versity of Richmond, William and
Mary College, Duke University, Uni-
versity of South Carolina, University
of West Virginia, North Carolina
State College and the host school,
Wake Forest College.

Editor’s Note: Statistics released
by the secretary of the Assimilation
Committee indicate that the com-
mittee has been active in maintain-
ing the traditions on the campus and
in town.

The figures also show that the
committee has not been overbearing
in distributing fines to those who
appear before it. In all, 90 persons
have been assimilated. Fifty-nine
of these received fines and thirty-
one were released with warnings.
A majority of those assimilated and
those released have been freshmen
and sophomores. Fifty-one under-
classmen have appeared before the
committee and nearly one-half of
these have not been fined.

The following is a letter to the
Friday edition of the Ring-tum Phi
from a student who is vitally inter-
ested in maintaining the traditions
of W&L. Don Partington, chairman
of the Assimilation Committee writes:
Gentlemen:

In the Tuesday edition of the

Assimilation Committee Chairman

presented his views on our Wash-

I am writing a reply to Mr. Ouel-
lette, not in the capacity of chairman
of the Assimilation Committee, but
as a senior and member of the stu-
dent body who is personally offended
by such tirades against this uni-
versity.

I would not disagree with Mr.
Ouellette’s statement of the obvious
fact that the University has made
changes. Nor would I disagree with
his statement that idealism elevates
man. However, Mr. Ouellette seems
to be operating under one basic fal-
lacy. He has reduced his attacks to
broad generalizations which are not
entirely substantial. I would not dis-
agree that there are some students
because of a sophomoric attitude to-
wards university life in all of its
phases are the only students who
wish to abolish our speaking tradi-
tion and conventional dress. How-
ever, this same student, who refuses
to buy a dance plan, snubs his nose

Number 15

Gen. Hamlett To Speak November 15
On ‘Army Role In Modern

Warfare’

W&L ROTC
Sponsors Talk

Major General Barksdale Ham-
lett will speak in Lee Chapel on
Tuesday night, Nov. 15, at 8 p.m.,,
on the subject of “Planning for the
Army’s Role in Modern Warfare.”
The talk is being sponsored by the
Military Science Department of
Washington and Lee.

Since his graduation from the
United States Military Academy in
1930 and commissioning in the Field
Artillery, General Hamlett has serv-
ed with distinction in both World
War II and the Korean War.

General Hamlett’s education has
continued throughout his military
career and has included the com-
pletion of courses at the Field Army
Regular School in 1935, the Ecole
Superieure de Guerre in 1946, and
the National War College in 1949.

His pre-war duty included assign-
ments at Fort Sam Houston, Texas,
Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and Fort
Sill, Oklahoma.

During World War II he served in
the United Kingdom, North Africa,

x and Central Europe. In October 1946

he was appointed gunnery instruc-
tor at the Artillery School at Fort
Sill, and later became the director
of the Department of Gunnery in
July 1947.

He went to Korea in December of
1951 for duty as artillery command-
er of the 24th Infantry Division. It
was during this tour of duty that
he achieved the rank of Brigadier
General.

General Hamlett returned to Eu-
rope in 1957 where he was appointed
United States Commander, Berlin
(USCOB) and Deputy Chief of the
United States Mission, Berlin. This
assignment continued until Dec. 3,
1959.

Upon returning to the United
States, General Hamlett was ap-
pointed to his present position as
Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for
Military Operations, Department of
the Army.

General Hamlett’s citations and
awards include the Silver Star; Le-
gion of Merit with Two Oak Leaf
Clusters; the Bronze Star; Army
Commendation Ribbon; Czech War
Cross; and the United Nations Serv-
ice Medal. :

General Hamlett is married to the
former Frances Underwood of Bowl-
ing Green, Ky. The Hamlett’s have
one daughter, Otila, who is married
to First Lieutenant Robert F. Stan-
ley, of the West Point class of 1955.

 

W&L Religious Emphasis Week

Interest Is Aroused By Lectures

By JACK EURE
Staff Reporter

Dr. David W. Sprunt, Chaplain
of Washington and Lee University,

 

spoke Tuesday night in the Student
Union Building on the attitudes of

 

Dr. Cecil Jones.

John Dunnell talks over his part in the forthcoming Troub play with

 

—Phote by Renshaw

 

Christians toward non-Christian re-
ligions.

The talk was one of a series de-
signed to stimulate students to
think about religion in preparation
for the lectures which Dr. Nels F. S.
Ferre will deliver during the Reli-
gious Conference.

The annual event will get under-
way Wednesday with a talk by Dr.
Ferre, a member of the Andover
Newton Theological Seminary.

Dr. Ferre will speak to the en-
tire student body at 12 noon in
the university’s Doremus Gymnas-
ium. He will talk on “Biblical
Faith and Modern Thought.”

Other visiting theologians for the
three-day conference will be Dr.
David Wice, rabbi of Congregational
Rodeth Shalom in Philadelphia, and
the Rev. Francis R. McCarthy, pastor
of St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic
Church in Lexington.

Dr. Wice and the Rev. Mr. Mc-
Carthy will deliver talks during
night sessions of the conference.

Each speaker will conduct class-
room discussions and informal pri-
vate talks with students. George
Birdsong, a junior from Suffolk, is
chairman of the event.

Sprunt Said
“Christians,” said Dr. Sprunt,
“have three different prospectices
concerning non-Christian religions.”
They are namely, the “traditional

orthodox,” the “liberal,” and the
“mediating” attitudes.

The “traditional orthodox” attitude
assumes an exclusionist’s view, for it
sets up Christianity as the only true
religion, the only road to salvation;
thus it requires a complete break
from all other religions.

Must Find God

Those who have a “liberal” atti-
tude, on the other hand, violently
oppose the exclusionist’s point of
view and contend that every person
must find God for himself in his own
way. Other religions, believes the
“liberal,” are striving for the same
goals and achieving the same re-
sults as are Christians; only they
are going about the work in differ-
ent ways. The Hindu saying, “Truth
is one; men call it variously,” well
sums up the “liberal” attitude to-
ward other religions.

As may be suspected, the “me-
dian” viewpoint is more or less a
combination of the first two: for this
attitude is neither one of total ac-
ceptance nor one of total rejection.
Although the “median” concept of
non-Christian religions contends
that the highest truths are found
in Christianity, this attitude does
not deny the virtues of other be-
liefs. Emphasis is placed on person-
al understanding of the religions
of fellow men. A Christian of the

 

“median” attitude is willing to put

“All America speaks on November 8th, and we speak to all |
the world—to freedom fighters in a Polish attic; to Africans |
building a jungle school; to Latin Americans fearing the advent |
of other Fidel Castros; to Japanese mothers still binding up |
the wounds of Hiroshima; to students in Bombay; to editors |
in Beirut; to all who wonder which way lies the future—with | nationally. Once we are cognizant of our present position we
freedom or with slavery. America will speak to all of them on)

November 8th—and to Mr. Khruschev, too.”—Senator John |
F, Kennedy.

Washington and Lee, it appears, spoke on October 3 1st— |
or was it a voice at all? The blatent, satirical observations of |
a Tuesday columnist reflect the sentiment of many here. Unfor-
tunately the above mentioned columnist not only imputes
motives to the individual candidates, but no doubt would also
boast of his experience and knowledge of foreign policy as

superior to that of one of the aspirants. The campus survey |

would lead us to believe that the 47 per cent of the student body

who spoke here Monday were heralds of world opinion. |

However, we feel that this like most polls will prove inaccurate,
and the Tuesday column, like most columns, tasted of a destruc-
tive, negative element—that motivation which continually de-
sires the abolition of traditions, societies and the like. This
bias criticism rather than constructive, logical and dedicated |
reason is a cancer of journalism.

This ‘journalistic negation” is not the common voice of an
idealistic America, nor for that matter, Washington and Lee.
Our thoughts are positive, although we are ever mindful of
negative threats; our goals are idealistic, although we are
checked by conservative satisfaction; and our intentions are
good though often branded by ignorance and error.

Next Tuesday America’s voice will be heard. Voting trends
will reflect particular sentiments—often regional. Not every
American will vote with the same conviction. A president will
be elected, however, and it will be the duty of every loyal citizen
to rally behind him—not necessarily cherishing his means, for
they will be challenged, but sharing with him a goal for the
future of America.

This goal is crucial, and the means, as the campaign issues
suggest, are also important. Sen. John F. Kennedy is an idealist,
but his idealism is not a reservoir of lip service. He recognizes
the critical fact that America must move toward her goal as
a nation, acknowledging her present situation as potentially
dangerous, and realizing the hope for the nation as it must
be. So far, time has tolerated our static trend, but if history
repeats itself, our clocks had best be rewound.

Senator Kennedy recognizes the domestic crisis as well as
international peril. As has been suggested by a political analyst,
his opponent, Vice-President Nixon also harbors an awareness
and cherishes goals, but Nixon has been telling the voters:

“Elect me and Lodge, and we will arrange it for you.” Mr.

views to a cause whose shadow looms over Eastern Europe

Che Bing-tum| [Phi

Kennedy’s constant appeal to America has been: “Wake up,
go to work, realize the deadly seriousness of the contest, and
persevere.”

Kennedy is no soothsayer, he is only calling for a realistic
appraisal of this nation’s status, both domestically and inter-

should be better able to work for the realization of our ideals.
| These ideals must be realized, or we ultimately will fall subser-

and now ninety miles from our southern coast. The com-
| munist threat advocates a firm policy, it definitely has an ideal
|to which their whole system is oriented and the realization of
this ideal will remove our country from the face of the earth.

If our domestic posture continues in stagnation, we can
hope for nothing short of malignancy, both in its governmental
and social, as well as economical ramifications.

The following observation was made recently by a noted
commentator in The Washington Post:

“It has been said that the hard doctrine which Kennedy
preaches downgrades America. Quite the contrary. The preach-
ers of the hard doctrine, which calls for effort and sacrifice, '

 

 

| placency, who shock the people with the bitter truth, are the
ones who believe in their people, who believe in them enough |

gence, do not downgrade the nation. They force it to look at its

have usually been, like Winston Churchill in the days of Stanley
Baldwin, the greatest patriots and the truest servants of the
| people.

“Those who arouse the people from torpor and com-

to summon them to greatness. The Churchills who cry out when
the people are lazy, selfish, and sluggish with private indul-

best possibilities, and in doing that they revivify, they rejuven-
ate, they renew the spirit of the people, and invest them with
pride that goes with the full exercise of human powers.”

We have stated previously the analogy that can be drawn
between the progressive reform advocated by Senator Kennedy
and the progress anticipated by a university community such
as Washington and Lee. Both are promoted through sound
judgment and an understanding of the needs in those areas un-
der consideration; both have a goal—be it national or academic
excellence; both are dedicated to the removal of derelection of
any form. If we are cognizant of both these ideals and pay lip
service to neither, we are more apt to secure both the blessings
of liberty and the fruits of a good education. On the other hand,
if we become smug and self-satisfied with the ever-available
status quo, and settle down amid a guise of conservatism, then
we cannot expect our institution (nation or university) to
meet the requirements of survival in an age which enjoys con-
stant and considerable flux.

Now is the time for greatness! Rather we should tighten
our belts than chains. Sacrifice on the part of a nation or an
individual is not a glamorous vote appeal—it is stimulated by

 

the sharp sting of reality. This sting can be temporarily soothed
by the tranquilizers of illogical boasting and political chest

 

 

pounding, but the poison is under the skin and only through
its removal will the wound heal and vitality be restored.

Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy is a man who can lead
this country with purpose and courage so that it may coalesce
in strength and move toward a realization of its potential as a
nation. His victory will not be an easy one Tuesday, nor will
our victory be an easy one from now on. A man seldom finds
spiritual meaning by assuming or affecting a false air of piety.
It is usually secured by an honest self-appraisal and dedication
and by getting down upon one’s knees. So shall this nation
realize its future, and of such shall we speak.

 

Kennedy: A Positive Program

Students Shouldn’t Be Required
To Attend ‘Emphasis Week’ Meets

By JIM VANN as it is fine for the English Commit-

For Leadership

By Robert Ketcham
Friday Political Writer

This campaign has now progressed
to the point of differentiating the
two candidates and committing most
of the voters. It has not been like
an action of law where the moot
question is inadmissible, but an
open field of activity with never
ending crescendo. Mr. Kennedy has
directed his thoughts to a more vig-
orous country, while Mr. Nixon has
constantly maintained that we are
in excellent health, but could im-
prove a bit.

There is a deep-seated difference
in the candidates which becomes in-
creasingly clear. Mr. Kennedy is
liberal by conviction and campaigns
in the same spirit, “It is reasonable
to say we've got to do something
about low-income housing, we’ve got
to do something about minimum
wages, we've got to do something
about our schools. Reason tells me
we've got to do these things.”

Nixon Wants Image

Mr. Nixon is liberal by political
pragmatism, there is no philosophic
base to his thinking. He is what he
thinks the people want him to be;
he looks for his image in their eyes.
He is willing to use Madison Avenue
tactics and talk down to those who
treat him as just another product.
Perhaps this approach will get him
votes, but it is not the kind of ex-
perience that will count when is-
sues of leadership arise after inaugu-
ration.

Admittedly, it is hard to identify
oneself with the type of administra-
tion now in power, and at the same

 

time criticize its weakness. However,
Mr. Nixon had the opportunity to
campaign in a Rockfeller-like man-
ner with an assessment of the na-
tional situation and an appeal for the
vice-president to lead it forward. He
did not do this; in extemporizing
the soft doctrines and searching for
issues he has lost much ground and
has now reverted to the President’s
coattails.

In the field of foreign affairs there
is one similarity: neither candidate
has taken an admirable stand on
Cuba. Mr. Kennedy’s advocating
U.S. aid for anti-Castro rebels is
sad because his campaign has been
relatively rational. Nor is he to be
excused because his opponent Mr.
Nixon, in a masquerade of horror,
followed in similar manner by stating
that we repeat in Cuba “what we
did with Guatemala” (which was a
U.S.-financed uprising.)

Foreign Policy Issue

Foreign policy was the big issue
in the 1956 campaign. It still is. Mr.
Nixon’s bold assertion that “at the
present time American prestige is at
an all time high” is a bland assur-
ance which even Administration re-
ports do not back up. The Ameri-
can Image, in adman’s language,
is an important quotation on the
international market. Mr.

chosen to say that it is downgrad-|
ing America to talk of declining pres- |

tige, and this long after the con-
cealed report had been made to the

National Security Council of which |

is admittedly pro-Kennedy) consid-
ers the ignoring of the report a mor-
al question, in that Mr. Nixon is

consciously deceiving the nation. To
this writer it is merely pathetic; it
is the saddest kind of spectacle to
see an intelligent man like Mr. Nixon
so caught up with his own campaign
web that he must go this far to at-
tempt escape.

Set Moral Tone

The President of this country needs
to be of strong character, granted
he must also be a politican or hero,
but he needs a fiber of courage to
lead and set the moral tone for
America. Several instances give con-
cern to this writer as to Mr. Nixon’s
capabilities: if he is elected, I hope
I am wrong as to capabilities, but at
least they should be stated. Mr. Nix-
on attacked Truman’s firing of Mac-
| Arthur and introduced a resolution
demanding the General be restored
to his post. However, when he ran
for Vice-President he made much
of Eisenhower’s pledge to seek an
armistice in Korea. MacArthur was
fired for advocating a “hot pursuit”
which would have pushed the war
into China, while the
wished to fight a limited war of
containment.

Mr. Nixon voted to kill the Trade
Agreements Act in 1949, although he
| has generally taken a liberal trade
| position. He was one of the original
sponsors of the Bricker Amend-
| ment in 1952, an issue not entirely
dead even today, but has associated
'himself with the President’s oppo-
| sition to the amendment. When Mr.
Stevenson proposed unilateral sus-
pension of nuclear tests, Nixon de-
| nounced it, saying, “Mr. Stevenson’s
| brand of peace seems to amount to
| achieving peace through weakness.”

 

 

| agencies;

President |

 

He has defended Mr. Eisenhower’s
unilateral suspension of tests, never-
theless, as a proposal of strong ini-
tiative. Mr. Nixon endorsed the
repeal of the Connally Amendment,
along with the American Bar Asso-
ciation and others. Three weeks ago
he reversed and is now committed
to support the amendment. When Mr.
Eisenhower calls for a “man who
will think first and then act wisely”
he forgets, as do others who talk of
opening mouths too quickly, of Nix-
on’s public advocacy of intervention
in Indochina by American ground
forces in 1954, and these afore-
mentioned reversals.

Another major difference is the
candidates’ philosophy of govern-
ment; and it is this area that W&L
men seem to be the most concerned.
On the one hand government is con-
sidered inherently dangerous and |
undesirable, there being a pronounc- |
ed preference for non-governmental

 

 

on the other it is wel-
comed, it is deemed the appropriate |
instrumentality for promoting the |

Three Recessions, 7 Years |

Neither Mr. Eisenhower nor Mr.
Nixon mentions economic growth as
a method of paying for further pro- |
grams. It is because the administra- |
tion has no way of combatting infla-
tion except for an almost chronic de- |
pression. Nixon says the nation is
producing a great deal of wealth, |
so it is. However, it is relatively less |
than most all our industrial competi- |
tors. Mr. Kennedy would raise so- |
cial security taxes to finance medi- |
cal care, reform the tax structure to |
take in more revenue by closing well |

Friday Columnist

As I have so often remarked, this
has certainly been an eventful and
progressive year
here at Washing-
ton and Lee. Not
only have there
been physical
changes, but there
have also been
many worthwhile
changes in the cat-
alog. But there is
still one area of
the University
policy that I feel
is ready for some
very definite modification and
change. This is the conduct of the
University Religious Emphasis
Week—an event that is all too soon
to be upon us. It is certainly not
my purpose to belittle the intent
and, I’m quite sincere, the sincerity
that is behind this week; but I do feel
that it is a very grave imposition
upon the student body-at-large to
force them to attend assembly and
shorten the classes for several days.

Vann

To a great many people, myself
included, religion is a very personal
matter and there is, to these people,
something very unappealing about
“Emphasis Weeks.”

This is not to say that I am ques-

that the one gets the benefit of
shortened classes and a command

Council’s choice of speakers, but
these other groups have probably
much more eminent men— eminent
in the sense that their national pres-

given all these fringe benefits.

The point then is simply that I
do not feel that it is fair for one
group here on the campus, especial-
ly a group that is concerned with
very private and personal matters,
to be given a position of enforced
prominence. If the calibre of the

student body choose to attend, all
well and good.

Four key injuries may prevent Washington and Lee’s fresh-

the start of the non-subsidized athletic program. The Brigadiers
face Massanutten Military Academy tomorrow at Weedstock,
Va., in their season final.

Statistically Martin has gained

passes for 29 yards and a touchdown.

The Generals should remember

PiKA Captures Intramural Tennis Championship;
Delts Take Unofficial Lead In I-M Standings

Thus far Washington and Lee’s
Intramural program has seen the
completion of only three of the fall
sports—track, swimming, and recent-
ly tennis.

In a close fought match for the
tennis championship, the PiKA’s de-
feated the Betas, the Law School,
and the Phi Kaps for the tennis
crown. Although this championship
has been decided, the points for all
house has not been determined, and
therefore cannot be included in the
tabulation below.

ing 50 points in both participa-

followed by the Phi Delts, KAs,
and SAEs.

In the only other I-M sport to

 

 

 

reach completion, the Phi Psis cap-
tured the swimming championship
with the SAEs, Phi Phis, and Delts
rounding out the top contenders.

At present, there are still two
contests in contention before the fall
season will officially draw to a close.
The league playoffs are still in pro-
gress for the golf crown, while the
touch football program has just be-

In this year’s football contest

Halfback Stuart Yoffe, who scor-
ed all 18 of the Brigadiers’ points
in a 20-18 loss to Ferrum Junior
College last week, is a doubtful
starter because of a sprained ankle.

Yoffe injured his ankle midway
through the Ferrum game, but the
injury did not seem to slow him
down. In the fourth quarter, he out

yards with a kickoff for the final
W&L touchdown.

The second unit, sparked by

In collecting their 3-2 record, the
Brigadiers whipped Hargrave, 20-0;
Woodberry Forest, 13-0; Augusta,

The team has played exceptionally
well despite several minor injuries
and despite their great handicap of

at anyone with an an academic mind
and persists in calling anyone who
does not come up to his standards
of social recognition a fish.

Mr. Ouellette, any student will de-
rive from Washington and Lee as
much as he gives to this university.
Granted this is a truism, but you
seem not to be aware of it. You can-
not deny that the friendly greeting
of another Washington and Lee
student is uplifting. You cannot deny
that the wearing of coats and ties is
distinctive. If you are interested in a
university which has no distinctive
qualities, no traits which sets it
apart from other institutions of
learning, you should not be at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Before a boy comes to Washington
and Lee, before he arrives on the
campus, he is aware that this is a
school of fine traditions. Any boy

known loopholes, and give tax in-

cessions in seven and one-half years.

This country has solved the prob-
lems of producing goods, but the
problems of private indulgence and
full exercise of our society’s power is
still with us. A President who can
mobilize public opinion to make
recognizable the urgent needs of
military, economic, scientific, and
cultural power would be one who
has a firm belief that our people can
be summoned. Merely to point out
that this country is great because
it is rude to Khruschev, has kept
China out of the UN, and has a high

who feels he is above traditions has
no place at Washington and Lee.
And I would question the possibility
of abolishing the speaking tradition.
Do we simply announce that tomor-
row nobody will greet another per-
son? Is this what we do? Do we
just throw away intangible qualities?
I question your belief that we must
get rid of a tradition because it does
not reach the ideal state. If you
really believe that we should get rid
of these traditions, perhaps we should
get rid of the fraternity system. Does
100 per cent brotherhood exist in
every house on campus? You also
seem to forget that the changes made
on this campus have been for the
best. I doubt if you believe the abo-
lition of the speaking tradition or
conventional dress would be better
for this campus.

You also misunderstand the pur-
pose of the Assimilation Committee
(a committee which ideally should
not exist). This committee has never
served as a gestapoeing force. If we
have, so has the Executive Commit-
tee.

You should also read the history
of your university. General Lee did
not say a gentleman was only a
man who did not lie, cheat or steal.
Conventional dress and the speaking
tradition are also qualities of a
gentleman. I maintain that the boys
who flaunt our traditions and have
no regard for them, have no place
in this university. You do not advo-
cate a change for the better. You
advocate the abolition of our herit-
age.

IFC Blood Drive Is Set
Nov. 18; Thefts Discussed

At a recent meeting of the Inter-
fraternity Council, IFC President
Dave Lefkowitz said the two major
topics discussed were first, the Blood
Drive and, second, the matter of
stealing during party weekends.

As usual, the IFC is sponsoring
a Blood Drive this year in conjunc-
tion with the American National
Red Cross. John Mullin, a KA soph-
more, is chairman of the Blood
Drive Committee. He says that the
drive will take place on Nov. 16
between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4
p.m. A keg of beer will be awarded
the house donating the most pints
of blood and another will go to
the house which has the highest per-
centage of its members contributing.
There are usually two Blood Drives
each year.

On Stealing

Dean Farrar spoke to the IFC
concerning stealing during party
weekends. To avoid theft of dates’
purses it is recommended that each
house provide space for the girls’
belongings. The housemother’s room
was suggested as a place. It is also
recommended that either Proctor
Murray or the police be contacted if
anyone is caught stealing during a
weekend. This policy would tend to
keep town campus friction to a min-
imum, he said.

Students nominated for Wood-
row Wilson National Fellowships
are urged to take the Miller An-
alogies Test Nov. 2 at 3 p.m.

Physically, the Generals go into
the Tech game in as good shape as
they went into the Hampden-Syd-
ney contest. Halfbacks Bob Funk-
houser and Skipper Smith are out
for the year, but McLaughlin has
three healthy replacements for
them.

Sophomore Charlie Gummey, who
was quickly switched from right to
left half last week and who shared
the spotlight with Martin, gained
62 yards in 14 carries and scoring
eight points, is again ready for left
halfback duty along with Jim Hick-
ey and Dave Tharp.

Again McLaughlin figures that
W&L’s three-man depth at each po-
sition will play an important role
in the Tech game. The Tartans are
strong but lack depth.

STU’S EXPLAINING HOW MACHINES WILL
SOME DAY “OUTTALK” PEOPLE

“Stu” Smith graduated from Southern Cal

Los Angeles area. As a pioneer in this new data
transmission field Stu predicts data processing
machines will some day do more Long Distance

“talking” than people.

Stu contacted 12 other companies before join-
ing Pacific Telephone. “I don’t think there’s any
limit to where a man can go in the telephone
business today. Of course, this isn’t the place for
a guy looking for a soft touch. A man gets all the
opportunity he can handle right from the start.
He’s limited only by how well and how fast he

can cut it.”
