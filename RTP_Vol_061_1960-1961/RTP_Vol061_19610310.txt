Business School

Courses Change
For Next Year

Two revised courses, Economics | ®

206 and 261, and one new course,

Economics 202, will be offered to

commerce students next year.
Economics 206 will change

now there are two separate courses
in transportation and public utilities.
These two industries have such sim-

ilar problems and methods of regu- |}
lations that a condensation of the

two subjects has been approved by
the Commerce School.

Economics 261 will emphasize a
study of concentrations in American
Economy instead of the present
course in public utilities. It will be
an experimental, reading seminar
class dealing with the effects on the
total economy of concentration or
“bigness” of labor, business, and
government. (Dr. Phillips will or-
ganize the two courses this summer.)

Economics 202 will be the new ad-
vanced course in Quantitative Meth-
ods. It will offer an up-to-date study
of the understanding of the highly
technical and advanced Electronic
Data Processor. Dean Adams of the
Commerce School states that this
new course will be the needed and
important follow-up to the elemen-
tary statistics course, 201.

This change in curriculum is de-
signed to add a more streamlined
program to the Commerce School.
By combining several of the courses,
it was felt that a more unified pro-
gram may be presented. Also, other
revisions will bring other courses
more up-to-date.

Dr. Arnold Toynbee Speaks
At 8 O'clock In Gymnasium

Eminent British Historian Dr.
Arnold J. Toynbee will talk tonight

W&L Concert Guild Presenting
Pianist George Feyer On Monday

Monday night in Lee Chapel, the
W&L Concert Guild brings George
Feyer to the Washington and Lee
campus. Feyer is probably already
well known among the student body.

Since November 11, 1955, when
Cafe Carlyle was opened to the
public, George Feyer has played the
piano and entertained the guests that
return time and again to hear him.

At the piano Mr. Feyer has the
rare capacity to project a very in-
dividual musical personality without
seeming to project at all. He has the
air of a man whom nothing—and no
one—can ever quite surprise.

Feyer’s appeal is to both the young
and their elders. This appeal to
nearly all tastes is based on the fact
that he is both uncomplicated and
absorbing.

Although trained as a classical
pianist at the Conservatory in Buda-
pest, he gradually shifted to play-
ing popular music. “I liked popular
music very much,” he explains, “and
I especially enjoyed getting into di-

 

rect contact with people. I want to
feel that contact right here and now
rather than sit on a concert stage
and read the reviews in the morn-
ing.”

Feyer moved to Paris, and for sev-
eral years played in the best night
clubs in that city as well as in
Belgium, Holland, Spain and other
European countries. He came to
America in 1951.

Since he has been in America he
has produced many albums; those
best known are his highly successful
“Echoes” series which consist of
Echoes of Vienna, Echoes of Italy,
Echoes of Broadway, Echoes of Hol-
lywood, Echoes of Latin America,
More Echoes of Paris, Echoes of
Spain, Echoes of Childhood, Echoes
of Christmas. His latest recording
features such songs as Gigi, Sep-
tember Song, Third Man Theme, and
Theme from “The Apartment.”

The program begins at eight
o’clock—everyone is urged to be
on time.

sity officials said.

Dr. Toynbee arrived this morning
in Buena Vista and is a guest of
Dr. and Mrs. E. D. Myers of 301
Jackson Ave. Dr. Myers is a personal
friend of the British Historian and
has collaborated with him on several
occasions.

Dr. Toynbee’s appearance is being
sponsored by the University Com-
mittee on Lectures, headed by Dr.
A. W. Moger professor of Ameri-
can History.

At 5:30 this afternoon, Don Mur-
ray of W.D.B.J.-TV in Roanoke will
interview Dr. Toynbee in the Dining
Hall. Dr. Toynbee will be on cam-
pus tomorrow.

Phi Gams, ZBT
And KA’s Elect
New Officers

Three fraternities have announced
the election of new officers for the
coming year. The Phi Gams and
ZBT’s have selected new governing
bodies at recent fraternity meetings.

Steve Rutledge, a junior from
Seattle, Washington, was selected as
the new president of Phi Gamma
Delta. Rick Kurz, a junior from
Philadelphia, Pa., was chosen treas-
urer. Corresponding secretary will be
Dennis Brack, a junior from Dallas,
Texas.

Two sophomores, Meade Christian

 

and Hunter Manson, complete the |
list of new Phi Gam officers. Chris- |

tian was elected recording secretary
and Manson was chosen as Historian.

Sam Helliman, a junior from
Chandler, Oklahoma., was selected
as the new president of Zeta Beta
Tau for the coming year. Steve
Galef, a junior from White Plains,
N.Y., will serve as the new vice-
president. Sophomores Randy Cole
ond Tony Schlessinger will serve as
the secretary and treasurer respec-
tively. Howie Bing, a junior from
Scarsdale, N. Y., was chosen pledge
trainer.

Three new officers have been
selected by the Kappa Alpha frater-
nity.

Roy Goodwin, a junior from Au-
gusta, Ga., who was elected presi-
dent last week, succeeds Nathan
Simpson. Elected as vice-president
and rush chairman was John P.
White, a junior from Scranton, Pa.

Robin Norfleet, a junior from Or-
ange, Va., was elected secretary.
The fraternity will elect officers
again in March 1962.

tory. While here in 1958 he worked
on revisions, and a 12th volume en-
titled “Reconsiderations” will appear
this April.

This morning and Saturday morn-
ing Dr. Toynbee will meet informal-
ly with advanced students in philos-
ophy and history.

Toynbee Defends Position

Some of Dr. Toynbee’s ideas have
sparked controversy and stimulated
thinking. He has been accused of
being anti-semitic for comparing the
Israeli treatment of Arabs in 1948
to the Nazi persecutions of World
War II. Dr. Toynbee answered the
criticism by saying, “It is impossible
to be wicked more than 100 per cent.
For example, I don’t have to kill
more than one man to be a murder
er.”

The space race, he says is a form
of “escapism.” He contends it is
“premature to think of outer space
before we’ve learned to keep the
peace with each other on this
planet.”

Professor at London

Prior to his retirement in 1955 Dr.
Toynbee was research professor of
international studies at the Univer-
sity of London. His long career in-
cluded service with Wellington
House during the First World War
and professorships of history and
language at the University of Lon-
don.

Spring Rites
Held At VMI
Monday Night

By ANDY NEA
News Editor

Last Monday evening, the quiet of
Lexington was briefly disturbed by
a minor insurrection at VMI. Ac-
cording to several Keydets that were
interviewed, the causes for the up-
rising were numerous. However,
they may all be generally attributed
to the ‘get’ tough’ policy instituted
this year by the new commandant.

Such new innovations as cutting
down on the number of weekends
in the outside world and a revision
in the ranking system have resulted
in dissension in the Corps. However,
the final blow came when the com-
mandant cut the Keydet’s Spring
liberty by nine hours. The Keydets
were ordered to be in their barracks
on Sunday at 9 p.m. instead of the
scheduled return of Monday at 7
a.m.

Around 7 p.m. Monday, things
started to happen when the dis-
gruntled Keydets began to commit
such unauthorized acts as slammin
doors and throwing paper into th
courtyard of the barracks.

The commandant, who had been
attending a cocktail party, was im-
mediately summoned to quell the
disturbance. The entire corps was
ordered to report to the parade
ground in fatigues. As a punishment,
they were double-timed around the
area twice and returned to their bar-
racks.

At 9 p.m. someone turned in a
false alarm that brought the faith-
ful Lexington Fire Department and
W&L students running. In an hour
everything had been returned to
normal. However, ten Keydets were
arrested on various charges that
stemmed from the disorder.

Damage was restricted to numer-~
erous broken windows and light-

The Speaking Tradition

A student recently referred to the “old standbys” of edi-
torial treatment as being campus politics, hell week, and the
speaking tradition. Initially, may we state that if there is any
seemingly undue preponderance in editorial comment in these
areas, it is only proportional to the also obvious abuses con-

nected with them.

We understand the student body’s hesitancy to choke up
in nostalgia at the mentioning of Lee’s name, but we do not
condone the widespread flaunting of traditions with which that
name is associated and upon which the prestige of this univer-

sity is so much dependent.

Seldom before in the history of Washington and Lee
has the speaking tradition reached the low ebb that it presently
enjoys among this student body. Such a year as this can also
be the death knell for this tradition if its revival is not forth-
coming. The failure to assimilate one class into the traditions of
Washington and Lee, or the wholesale neglect of one or other
conventions by the student body in session necessarily saps the
vitality of these traditions and eventually destroys them. This
creeping stagnation of the speaking tradition poses an inevit-
able threat to all of the other traditions here—including the

honor system.

It is incumbent upon all of the students and members of
the faculty and administration to preserve this invaluable herit-
age of Washington and Lee. A greeting is not a difficult thing
to render. The energy expended is negligible, and the response
received might momentarily pull one out of the vat of self-
concern. If a student considers himself above such a bourgeois
practice as casual speaking, then he is perhaps above Washing-
ton and Lee and should find some other place to dictate taste.

 

Sen. Goldwater Says Conservatists’
Job In Congress Is Obstructionist;
Race Solution Called ‘Inadequate’

By VICTOR LASSETER
Friday Columnist

Shortly after he spoke at Wash-
ington and Lee on March 1, Sen.
Barry Goldwater
was given an ex-
uberant welcome
by the Young
Americans for
Freedom, a group
of young conser-
vatives meeting in
New York City.
At this time Sen.
Goldwater pointed
out that the job
of the conserva-
tive in Congress
was “not to be just obstructionist,”
but to match each liberal program
with a detailed conservative altern-
ative.

This is a noble aspiration, and if
Sen. Goldwater can counter liberal
Democratic programs with studied
alternatives of his own he will be
doing a service to the development
of political theory in this country.
Some of Goldwater’s own plans were
revealed at his speech here at Wash-
ington and Lee. Goldwater present-
ed for example his own unique al-
ternatives to Democratic plans for
the solution of such problems as
federal-aid-to-education, segrega-
tion, and Communism. Some of
Goldwater’s counter-proposals, how-
ever, appeal more to emotion than to
reason.

Goldwater’s solution for the race
problem in America is woefully in-
adequate; in fact, it is not a solution
but a postponement of a solution.
In his speech here Goldwater implied
that federal power should be used
to end discrimination against Negro
voters, but he would not use federal
power to end racial segregation in
public schools. He doesn’t believe
in segregation, but neither will he
do anything to end it, a palatable
enough doctrine for Southern voters.

The solution offered by Goldwater
for the racial problem is his old
adage, Leave it to the Local Authori-
ties. The local authorities, in this
case, are unfortunately not the most
enlightened men in America: Ross
Barnett, Orval Faubus, and the hill-
billy singer from Mississippi, men
who have seldom shown neither the
willingness or the capability to work
out a solution to end racial discrimi-
nation.

 

Lasseter

Goldwater’s alternative to the
almost irrevocable committment of

 

w *

liberal Republicans and Democrats
to the U.N., NATO, and to search-
ing diplomatic negotiation is to
break off all relations with Soviet
Russia. This, Goldwater assures
us, would make all the neutralist
nations fall in line with the U.S.
And if Red China were admitted
to the U.N. Goldwater believes that
the U.S. Senate would take the |
U.S. out the back door as the
Reds walked in the front.

The neutralist nations, however,
would hardly fall in behind the U.S.
if we broke off relations with Rus-
sia. As many observers see it, a fun-
damental tenent of modern neutral-
ism is a definite lack of desire to
commit one’s country to either side
in the cold war, and to encourage |
peaceful negotiations between the,
two major powers. Perhaps this is|
the first time in history when we)
know who our enemy is, but hiding
behind an isolationist curtain isn’t
going to solve the problem.

 

 

Letter To The Editor

The Editor

The Ring-tum Phi
Friday Edition
Lexington, Virginia
Dear Sir:

I read with dismay last Friday
that the Assimilation Committee may
find it necessary to impose some sort
of punishment on those who fail to
comply with the “tradition” of!
speaking on campus. First there was
all that rubbish about the Dance
Plans; now we have to walk around
the campus looking out for some
hapless soul to grunt at.

What sort of a tradition is it that
must be imposed by force or threats
upon those who supposedly believe
in it? Traditions grow out of the mu-
tual ideals and needs of people, and
any attempt to superimpose such
feelings results in outward accept-
ance at the most, an attitude which
does not seem to indicate a healthy
regard for the basic principle of
tradition.

Further, if this “tradition” is so
sacred to the University, why should
it be discarded when one reaches
the boundary line? Can we pass by
our friends glassy-eyed four feet the
other side of McCrum’s or must we
hold out until we reach the Lyric?

Friday Reviewer

Pirandello handles reality among
his characters almost as a magician
who hides a coin under one of
several cups and then moves them
around. The coin is practically never
under the cup you would guess, and
like as not it will vanish altogether
during the show. In “Henry IV,” at
first it seems positive that the man
masquerading as Emperor is insane.
His world appears a world of un-
reality in which he knows nothing
of our twentieth century. It seems
equally positive that the people from
his former and sane existence are
from a real world. But as Henry IV
proves to have his wits about him
and to have chosen to continue liv-
ing the history he once lived in mad-
ness, his world seems a world of
concrete reality.

Allen Creates a Masterful Henry IV

The cast of “Henry IV” carries off
Pirandello’s magic with a swiftness
and a sleight of hand that hardly
leaves you time to think. Bob Allen,
the center of this confounding group
of players, creates a Henry IV who
is at one moment the essence of con-
trolled majesty, and at the next
dominated by a fury approaching in-
sanity.

In the first act, his Henry IV is an
actor, superbly artful, playing the
role of a madman to the courtiers
and the visitors. In the second act,
he gives a Henry IV who is vacil-
lating between acting the madman
and revealing himself as sane to
the men who play his courtiers. And
in the third, he plays a Henry IV
who emerges as a tragic hero, Gre-
cian in stature. His enigmatic crea-
ation of the character is subtle,
beautifully detailed, a consummate
piece of work.

major characters. Betty Saunders as
the Marchioness Matilda whom Hen-
ry had loved in his former existence,
and Tim Morton as Baron Belcredi,
her present companion, both pro-
vide excellent material for Bob Al-
len to work with. One of the most
amazing things about the perform-
ance of both is the Italian quality
they suggest so well in their person-
alities.

Betty Saunders makes a lovely
nothern Italian Marchioness. Her
Matilda has the inevitable appeal of
a woman who, though weak, can de-
stroy. Her coquetry is well done.

whole decadent richness of her mein
by the way she uses a cigarette
holder in the second act.

Tim Morton, again a very Italian
character, emerges as a supremely
obnoxious fop. With a self sureness,
with a posed quality, with graceful
but calculated use of his arms and
hands, he develops an arrogant and
hateful Belcredi. One of the best as-
pects of his portrayal is the crass-
ness with which he constantly goads
Henry IV. By the time he has been
stabbed, you feel that he should have
been run through some while ago.

.| moments in the play is the stabbing

of Belcredi. The tenseness of the re-
actions between Belcredi and Henry
IV during the third act are culmi-
nated in a moment of wild action.
Henry IV grabs the sword and, as
everyone moves in, lunges it into
Belcredi. The blocking is excellent
as through the rapidly moving bodies
the writhing body of Belcredi comes
into sight. One of the courtiers, Bob
Aylin, whose reactions throughout
are well sustained, expresses splend-
idly the horror and surprise and
realization that this act has sus-
pended Henry IV and his retinue
forever in their acting of history.

Applebaum as Psychiatrist

Jim Applebaum gives a devastat-
ing portrait of the psychiatrist. Ter-
ribly rational and superior, he none
the less asks before he meets Henry
IV, “I suppose he’s not armed, is
he?” Mervyn Clay handles with his
usual comic skill the role of the new
courtier, Berthold, who has studied
the history of Henry IV of France
rather than that of Henry IV of
Germany. And, while I am on the

_| subject, another bit of comic relief

was the whimsical bat who appeared
from the loft on opening night as
twilight came to the castle of Goslar.

Bob Fussell and Susan Howard as
the young couple were attractive.
The courtiers were effective and well
directed. The sets, which include two
huge tapestries and two full length
portraits by Dr. Junkin, are mag-
nificent. However, the color scheme
is better in the second and third acts
than in the first.

The costumes, save a rather ratty
cape that Matilda wears, are all very
grand. The direction is firm and
lucid, except for an impossible scene
to play in which the doctor is sud-
denly called away from Matilda and
Belcredi by the Marquis and Frida,
and immediately engages in a secret
conversation with them.

 

RES IPSA LOQUITUR

 

Even Noise Has Invaded The Library,
Will DAR Install McCormick’s Reaper?

By THORNS CRAVEN

Friday Columnist

In times like these everyone is
quick to agree that
there are few sac-
red places left on
earth, and fewer
than that on this
campus. But since
last Monday night
there is even one
one less than usu-
al on our hallowed
grounds. Now I
realize that most
of the news that
takes place on this
campus is quickly and accurately re-
ported, but I fear that in the case
of events which occurred on Monday
and subsequent nights nothing will
be said. Thus it is up to me to bring
a grave problem to light.

Craven

The more enlightened of my read-
ers have already guessed the situa-
tion that I am referring to. If you
are not among this circle of campus
elite, then I suggest you ask the man
on your right to give his version so
you can judge for yourself my treat-
ment of an issue which concerns us
all.

If, heaven forbid, you’re reading
alone, then forget this and go out
and make a friend. Maybe he can
tell you, and even if he can’t you'll
be able to sing the alma mater
without getting a lump in your
throat. But enough digression; it
is imperative that I begin my
shocking report.

On that fateful night of March 6
(Monday last to those of you who
don’t have a calendar handy), I en-
tered the hallowed halls of McCor-
mick Library to see what new mag-
azines had come in. Settling down
with The Scientific Journal I was
almost immediately awakened by
screams from the old co-op.

Now I’m all for SWMSFC, and for
SWMSFC musicals, and all that, but
some people actually study in the

 

library, and the old co-op is just too
close to have girls running around
in. But after a while, when more
people came in, the noise inside
cancelled out the noise outside and
everything was okay. So I picked
up The Film Quarterly and went
back to sleep. Then came the riot.
That was too much. Sirens, fire
engines, cadets screaming, girls
screaming, everybody running
around tables, uproarious laughter
coming out of the stacks. There’s
just so much a student can take.
And all the while not one Friend
of the Library went to his battle
station. The general disorder that
was prevalent was enough to make
me start studying for my quiz on
Tuesday. And no sooner had I start-
ed that than everything quieted
down. Such fickleness in the moods
of the students who use the library
should not be allowed.

So I humbly submit a few pro-
posals to keep this sort of thing from
recurring. Number one is the setting
up of a committee, and since we
already have the Friends of the Li-
brary and SWMSFC, I suggest that
the new committee be a marriage of
the two, and be called SWMFSCC
(Singer Will Move Singing From
Co-Op Committee.

Naturally they will move into
the lobby of the library. That way
the students won’t have to com-
pete with outside noise, and for
study breaks you can go out and
join the chorus. Just so the F and
L won't feel slighted about not-
having their initials in the com-
mittee name we can have the
SWMSFSCC-FOTLSC (the last six
letters naturally meaning Fire En-
gines Off The Lawn Sub-Commit-
tee). This sub-committee will na-
turally solve the problem of where
to put the fire engines. I can only
suggest that they consider that
glass enclosed bulletin board.

Now this committee solves only a
seasonal problem, and I think we
should think in terms of long-range

planning. Since the musical will soon
be performed and over, it will be
necessary to provide some form of
noise to make up for the loss we
will suffer when live music leaves
us. To the friends of the library

George A. Lear
Is The Oldest
W2&L Student

People who handle student records
at Washington and Lee often do a
double take when they run across
the registration card of George An-
drew Lear.

It says, among other things, “Birth-
date... 1912.”

Lear, who is sometimes mistaken
for a professor by his fellow stu-
dents, is enrolled as a special stu-
dent in Washington and Lee’s School
of Commerce and Administration,
where he is learning why he be-
came the successful businessman he
did.

“I’ve been in business constantly
since 1935,” he explains, “but I’ve
never had any formal economic
training. I feel I know the workings
but not the phrases.”

Learning the “phrases” is just one
reason Lear has returned to college
at the age of 49, 26 years after he
received his B.A. degree in political
science from Brown University.
Actually, he is brushing up his study
habits in preparation for enrollment
in Washington and Lee’s law school
next year.

“When I was in college,” he ex-
plained, “I wanted to be a lawyer,
but it just didn’t work out.” Follow-
ing graduation from Brown, Lear
settled down to raising a family and
a business career. Both enterprises
turned out well, indeed.

Mrs. Lear was the former Helen
A. Dewey of Lexington. There are
three children: George Jr., who is
now at the Sage School of Philoso-
phy at Cornell University; Suzanne,
who is studying at the Tyler School
of Fine Arts in Philadelphia; and
Richard, a sophomore at Lexington

Mr. Nathan Simpson, Editor
The Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University
Lexington, Virginia

 

Dear Sir,

In the past two weeks, it has come
to my attention that one of your
students has been affected in quite a
detrimental manner by the loss of a
day of study. This day, February 22,
I have been informed, is declared a
holiday in the region of Virginia.
Jack C. Martin, native son of the
glorious Commonwealth of Ken-
tucky, having majored in Kentucky
History in his prep school days, still
holds to the idea as do most Ken-
tuckians, that the region of Virginia,
having seceded from the United
States of America in the year 1861,
was fortunately accepted by the be-
nevolent people of Kentucky, as the
one hundred and twenty-first coun-
ty in the Commonwealth. Although
this arrangement has been quite a
strain on the economy of the Com-
monwealth, the people have shown
the foresight to support that high-
est institute of learning in the Com-
monwealth, Davis & Lee University.

Having left the region of Kentucky
proper in the fall of 1960 to enroll
in Davis & Lee University, Mr. Mar-
tin was so shocked to find that the
name of that greatest Kentuckian
had been deleted by the people of
Virginia County from the title of
the heretofore great university, and
replaced by an obscure Virginian,
g. w. washington, that he fell into
a melancholy that caused his grades
to fall far below the heights expect-
ed of him. When I first analyzed him
shortly after February 22, I found
him in the depths of an anti-wash-
ington complex. Please do everything
in your power to relieve this condi-
tion of his.

Yours sincerely,

Robert M. Polsgrove, M.D.

Delts Second; PiKA Moves Into Third

Phi Delts Retain Slim I-M Lead
After Latest Contest Tabulations

The Intramural season at Wash-
ington and Lee has now seen the
completion of eight of the competi-
tive events, and at the end of the
tabulation made just yesterday, the
Phi Delts continue their domin-
ance over the first place birth.

In close contention, a mere seven
points behind, are the Delts who
have maintained their standing
among the first division since the
last count was run.

The most notable change in the
comparative standings has result-
ed in the jump made by the
PiKA’s. At last count, they were
ninth, and a good fifty points be-
hind the first division leader, while
in the latest figurings they stand

 

only a scant twenty points from
the top-ranked entry.

In general, the race this year is
not much different from any of past
seasons. It is shaping up in the usual
tight-knight manner as a mere 30
points separate the top six frater-
nities in competition.

Among the PiKA’s, Phi Psis, and
SAE’s, there is but a six point spread,
which means that any slack on the
part of one will boost the others
farther into the lead.

In retrospect, it is quite interest-
ing to observe the rise and fall
of team performances as the houses
have entered into the different sea-
sons.

In the most recent contest, the

 

Robrecht Meets Sgt. Travis Tiller
In Return PAL Middleweight Bout
Tuesday At Quantico Marine Base

Ray Robrecht, Phi Gam Intermediate Law Student and the
General’s one-man boxing team, will be looking for his tenth
consecutive victory when he fights at the Marine Base at Quan-
tico, Va., next Tuesday, March 14.

Boxing for the Roanoke Police Athletic League team, which
has been undefeated in twenty-four matches during the last

——————

 

RAY ROBRECHT
Trains For Return Bout

 

five years, Robrecht will be seeking
his seventh victory in league com-
petition.

This bout will be a return en-
gagement in the 165-lb. weight-
class division against Travis Tiller
over whom he scored a unanimous
decision in their first encounter
last February 23 at the Roanoke
National Guard Armory.

After next Tuesday’s scrap, Ro-
brecht’s next fight will be early in
April when he and the Roanoke
P.A.L. compete at Norfolk in the
Virginia State Boxing Tournament.

This final bout in April will be
Ray’s last fistic outing of the year.
As for his future in boxing, he
is “undecided” at this point.

His tentative plans, however, do
call for continued training and box-
ing during the summer, as he has
done during past vacations, in his
hometown of Plainfield, N. J.

His diligent training schedule
for this coming bout has included
close to three miles of road work
each morning in addition to two
hours of workout in the gymna-
sium each afternoon. Dick Rose
and Bart Chamberlain continue to
serve as his sparring partners.

Looking at his last fight with Til-
ler, Robrecht commented, “I hope to
move more this time. In the last
bout, I waited for him, and was a
little wary of his longer reach and
good right hand, but this time I
plan to lead and jab more.”

 

Betas pulled off a stunning victory
over the Sigma Nus for the I-M
basketball crown. This victory rep-
resented the first championship for
the Betas this year, and they cur-
rently stand ninth among the fra-
ternities with 551 points.

Although the Delts started off the
season by capturing two trophies
in the fall competition series, they
have failed to add another to their
fold since last their freshmen ran
away with the annual Turkey Trot.

Their initial victory came in the
I-M track championship as_ they
edged out the Phi Psis and the KA’s
for the title.

For the third-ranked PiKA’s, the
fall season proved to be of great
benefit, as they picked up the tennis
and football crowns back-to-back.

The tennis championsip came to
be theirs as they squeaked past the
Betas 3-2 in the finals, while in foot-
ball, it was clearly a run-away
affair as they remained undefeated
by rolling up 138 points while allow-
ing their opposition a mere 18.

The Phi Phis, with their heavily
dominated freshman team raced to
victory in the I-M swimming cham-
pionships held in Doremus Gym.
Victories by several of their fresh-
men, who had not yet been enlisted
by Coach Eastman, proved to be
the margin of victory.

The top-ranked Phi Delts picked
up their only championship of the
season thus far, when they defeat-
ed the Phi Gams and Kappa Sigs
for the golf championship.

While this has been the only title
they have won so far, their com-
bined total is still a very respectful
first among the twenty teams in
competition for the Grand Intra-
mural Championship which will be
decided in the latter part of April
or early May.

The eighth and final sport which
has seen completion thus far in
the season was recently won by the
PiKA’s. The game was _ handball,
and the victory was narrowly pulled
away from the SAE’s and Phi Psis
in a double elimination playoff. The
initial round proved to be a stale-
mate, yet in the second go-round,
the title went to third-ranked PiKA.

With all of this just so much histo-
ry the intramural season is getting
into somewhat of a flurry, and the
month of March will see the near
completion of all athletic activity.

At the moment, the volleyball and
bowling crowns are up for grabs,
while next week the wrestling tour-
nament will get into full swing at the
gymnasium.

As of last night, the league win-
ners had all been decided in the
race for the volleyball crown. The
four successful houses in their
respective leagues include the Phi
Gams, Betas, Phi Psis, and the Pi
Phis. The league elimination tour-
