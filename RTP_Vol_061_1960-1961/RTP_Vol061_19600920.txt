Dean Pusey

Announces
Wilson Gifts

Attention was called today by
Dr. W. W. Pusey, Dean of the Col-
lege, to the Woodrow Wilson Na-
tional Fellowships for 1961-62,
for which academically outstanding
Washington and Lee seniors can be
nominated this fall.

As an encouragement to promising
young men and women to consider
careers in college teaching, the Foun-
dation each year fully supports a
thousand carefully selected fellows
in their first year of graduate work.

The Foundation primarily se-
lects candidates in the humanities
and social sciences, but in excep-
tional cases, when a clear prefer-
ence for a teaching career is dem-
onstrated, candidates for the na-
tural sciences are also considered.
The fellow receives fifteen hun-
dred dollars for the year’s study,
plus dependency allowances, while
the Foundation also pays tuition
and fees.

All seniors who are interested in
considering a career in college teach-
ing are urged to discuss the fellow-
ships at their earliest convenience
with their major professors and with
Dean Pusey, the Campus Represen-
tative for the Woodrow Wilson Fel-
lowships. Dr. Pusey stated that
13 Washington and Lee men have
received Wilson Fellowships in past
years, including four seniors last
June. Dr. Pusey stressed not only
the generous financial support which
the fellowships afford but also their
great prestige value. Besides the
recipients of the awards, he added,
many candidates receive honorable
mentions, which frequently lead to
financial aid from other sources.

Dr. Roger P. McCutcheon, South-
ern National Representative of the
Foundation will be visiting President
Cole on Tuesday and Wednesday
of this week and will discuss the
fellowships with members of the
Washington and Lee Committee on
Graduate Fellowships.

Rhodes Scholars
To Be Selected

Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy announc-
ed today that all Rhodes Scholar-
ship applicants must see him not
later than Saturday, Sept. 24. This
is necessary, according to Dr. Flour-
noy, so that all applicants may be
interviewed by the committee by the
end of the month, since the com-
mittee has to report to the faculty at
its meeting on the third of October.

 

To be eligible, a candidate must
be male and unmarried, a citizen
of the United States and have
been in residence for at least five
years. All applicants must be be-
tween the ages of 18 and 24. Schol-
ars who are elected in December
of 1969, will enter Oxford in Oc-
tober of 1961. A candidate is not
required to be a senior at the col-
lege or university that he is at-
tending, but Dr. Flournoy com-
mented that this grade-level edu-
cation would give him a much
better opportunity to win a schol-
arship.

The Committees of Selection for
Rhodes Scholarships will give great
regard to the qualifications set down
by Cecil Rhodes in the section of
the will in which he defined the
type of Scholar that he desired:

“(a) Literary and scholastic abil-
ity and attainments.

“(b) Qualities of manhood, truth-
fulness, courage, devotion to duty,
sympathy for and protection of the
weak, kindliness, unselfishness, and
fellowship.

“(e) Exhibition of moral force of
character and of instincts to lead and
to take an interest in his fellows.

“(d) Physical vigor, as shown by
fondness for and success in sports.”

The most important single quality
is the special distinction, whether
in intellect or in character, that sets
the Rhodes Scholar apart from his
fellows. He need not be a onesided
man, thus definite distinction of in-
tellect should be founded on sound
character, and definite distinction of
character should be based on sound
intellect.

To make application, students must
first be judged candidates by the
Washington and Lee Faculty Com-
mittee.

Dr. E. D. Myets
Returns to W&L

Dr. E. D. Myers, head of the
Philosophy department at Wash-
ington and Lee, has returned here
after serving two years as cultural
attache to the American Embassy
at Bonn, Germany. During his two
years in Germany, Dr. Myers gave
about 75 lectures to universities and
educational groups. He also worked
very hard to encourage the estab-
lishment of chairs in American liter-
ature at German colleges and uni-

 

Dr. Myers says that his work
with the United States Informa-
tion Agency in Germany has made
him very much aware of the im-
portance of this government ag-
ency and of the number of people
who fail to realize how vital the
USIA is to our foreign policy.
According to Dr. Myers a recent
survey in Germany has shown that
the greater understanding an in-
dividual has of American litera-
ture and history, the stronger his
approval will be of American for-
eign policy.

Before leaving for Germany, Dr.
Myers finished his book, Education
in the Perspective of History, which
was featured in the Sept. 17 issue
of the “Saturday Review.” The pur-
pose of the book is, in Dr. Myers
words, “to consider education in a
broad perspective (so) that many |
problems may more clearly be an-|
alyzed and solutions thereto more |
easily found...” The book contains
a summary chapter by Arnold Toyn- |
bee on the world-wide impact of
education. Dr. Myers and Mr. Toyn- |
bee worked together on Vol. XI of |
Toynbee’s Study of History.

Class Of 1964
Sets New Mark

This year’s freshman class at
Washington and Lee enrolls with
the distinction of having the highest
college board average of any class
yet to enter. The average student in
this class enters with a verbal score
of 548, and with a mathematical score
of 577. In 1959, the average scores
were 532 for the verbal test, and
563 on the math test. The increase
in verbal aptitude this year repre-
sents the greatest increase yet shown.
These scores are regarded as a great
standard of a student’s ability to
measure up to the college academic
work. Dean Gilliam places as im-
portant a stress on these as on the
past record of the students.

This year, 55 per cent of the
students matriculating come from
public high schools; this being a
reversal of last year’s trend, when
the same percentage came from
private schools. Seven freshmen
are contributed by each of three
private schools; Darlington School
and Westminister School, both in
Georgia; and St. Christopher’s in
Richmond. The public school send-
ing the greatest number of students
was the Lexington High School,
with six entrants.

Of significance to those persons in-
terested in how Washington and Lee)

compares with the eastern schools
is the survey that Time magazine
published in the May issue of their
magazine. Here, the so-called “Ivy
League” schools were listed as hav-
ing accepted a total of 13,640 fresh-
men, they had 8,545 confirmations, a
figure of 63 per cent. This year,
Washington and Lee had 1,264 appli-
cations, and accepted 44 per cent or
656 students. Of this number, there
were 325 entrants, 58 per cent.

Goodwyn Elected

‘President of ODK

Washington and Lee Will Be Host To 1964

| National Convention of Leadership Fraternity
reer =

| By BOB BRIDEWELL

| Warren Goodwyn, senior law stu-
|dent from Montgomery, Ala., has
been named President of the Alpha
| Chapter of Omicron Delta Kappa,
|a national honorary leadership fra-
ternity. Also chosen as officers for
the 1960-61 session were Billy Mc
| Williams, Vice-President, and Henry
| Harrell, Secretary.

| As an undergraduate, Goodwyn
| was President of the SAE House, a
| battalion commander in the ROTC,
and a Distinguished Military Stu-
dent. He has served on the Execu-
tive Committee for three years, and
is presently on the law school board
of governors. Last year he served
on the Steering Committee of the
1960 Mock Democratic Convention.

Billy McWilliams, the new ODK
Vice-President, is a Phi Delta
Theta senior from Selma, Ala. He
has served for two years on the}
Executive Committee, and is cur-
rently secretary of the student body.
McWilliams was President of the
1960 Spring Dance Set, and co-presi-
dent of the Cotllion Club. He is a
varsity letterman on the tennis team.

The secretarial duties of ODK have
been given to Henry Harrell, Sigma
Chi senior from Sabot, Va. Harrell
is the Vice-President of the Stu-
dent Body, and an EC committee-
man. He is a member of the W&L
Dance Board, SWMSFC, and a co-
president of the Cotillion Club. Har-
rell was President of 1959 Openings
Dances. The new ODK secretary is
an Honor Roll and Dean’s List stu-
dent and was chosen by the IFC as
the Outstanding Freshman in 1958.

These three officers assume the
leadership of the nation’s first circle
of Omicron Delta Kappa, for it was
on the W&L compus in December,
1914 that the ODK was founded.

bers of the Alpha Chapter is Rupert |

 

 

Bill Roberts

 

Roberts Is Head’
Of Tuesday Staff

Bill Roberts, a junior SAE from |
| Williamsburg, Va., has been appoint-
ed managing editor of the Tuesday
edition of the Ring-tum Phi. Rob- |
erts has been a reporter for the |
paper for the past two years. In|
addition to his work on the paper,
Roberts has maintained a 2.5 grade
point ratio; he has lettered for two|
years as an end on the varsity foot- |
ball team, and has done some work
on the Shenandoah. He is a member

|
of the Phi Eta Sigma Freshman |
Honorary Society.
Steve Galef, ZBT junior, from |

White Plains, N. Y., is the assistant
managing editor of the Tuesday
paper. Steve has maintained a quite
creditable record here at Washing-
ton and Lee. Last year, he w:
lected as vice-president of the dance

s se
iS se-

board and did excellent work for
the school paper.
Other members of the staff are

Bob Bridewell, SAE sophomore as

 

news editor; Harvey Allen, Kappa

Sig senior, as feature editor: Steve
Guild, Kappa Sig sophomore, as

| sports editor; Bill Smith, Lanny
Butler and Ronnie King as associate

| editors; Roger Paine and Hunter

| Manson, Phi Gam sophomores, as|

| copy editors and Bill Young, a D.U | pha,
sophomore, as photography editor

Nelson Latture, who is at present a
member of the W&L faculty.

Since its inception in 1914, ODK
has grown until it now includes
members from ninety colleges and
universities. The W&L chapter alone
has initiated over 820 men into the
Alpha Circle in its forty-five years
of activity.

The founders of ODK formed the
fraternity “to recognize men who
have attained a high standard of
efficiency in collegiate activities and
to inspire others to strive for con-
spicuous attainments.”

The five main qualifications for
membership are exemplary char-
acter, responsible leadership and dis-
criminatory service in campus life,
superior scholarship, genuine fel-
lowship and consecration to demo-
cratic ideals. ODK membership rec-
ognizes achievements in scholarship,
athletics, student government, so-
cial and religious affairs, publica-
tions, and the fine arts.

The current Alpha Circle of ODK
consists of Goodwyn, McWilliams,
Harrel, Kent Frazier and Tim Ire-
land as students in addition to num-
erous faculty and alumni members.
Dean Farrar is the faculty advisor
to ODK and Mr. Latture holds the
office of faculty secretary.

Mr. Latture commented that the
original founders of ODK on this
campus have been astonished at the
reception the organization had re-
ceived and the number of colleges
and universities that have petitioned
for chapters.

Fulbright Offers
900 Scholarships

Dr. Charles Turner, Washington
and Lee representative of the Ful-
bright Foundation, has announced
the availability of nine-hundred
scholarships to graduating seniors
of American colleges and universi-
ties for study abroad.

 

These grants enable qualified
students to continue their educa-
tion while living in a foreign land.
More than 31 countries are partici-
pating in the 1960-1961 Fulbright
program, with Germany, England
and France offering the greatest
number of scholarships. All of the
nine-hundred grants include a
nine month term of study at a
foreign university in the student’s
chosen field.

In order to be eligible for con-
sideration as a Fulbright Scholar,
the graduating senior must have a
cumulative grade average of B or
better. He must also have a general
knowledge of a foreign language. A
good statement of purpose and a
definite project while studying
abroad are both required of the
applicant. Letters of recommendation
should be submitted to the com-
mittee.

Dr.

seniors

Turner urged all qualified
to see him in his office
duPont 1, as soon as possible, as the
deadline for applications is Octo-
ber 31.

“Tam very anxious to see Wash-
ington and Lee continue its fine
record of Fulbright scholars. Last
year we had two W&L winners,
and in past years we have had as
many as six,”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Harken

The Freshman is a strange animal. He appears at Wash-
ington and Lee full of hopes, fears, enthusiasms and doubts
which may or may not be well grounded. The freshman at
W&L is confronted first by orientation exercises of Freshman
Camp, then by the hectic pace of Rush Week, during which
he not only determines his position in many of his classes
through his performance on a number of placement tests, but
also makes one of the most important decisions of his college life
when he chooses those boys with whom he will be living, social-
izing and studying for the next four years.

During the rush of this two-week period, the freshman is
introduced to and indoctrinated with the traditions of the
school. With the advent of the new administration, the new
freshman commons, and “‘the challenge of the sixties,” the
curriculum, the fraternity system and even the daily routine of
the university have undergone various changes. We only hope
that the traditional spirit and the reputation of Washington and
Lee as a school for gentlemen will remain unchanged.

The duty of upholding the reputation and tradition of
the school falls upon the faculty, the student body, the admin-
istration, and more especially upon the Class of 1964. To the
frustrated and seemingly hard pressed freshman, the details
of W&L tradition may seem trivial. The wearing of the beanies
and conventional dress, the speaking tradition and the tradi-
tion which prohibits freshmen from walking on the grass are
all a part of Washington and Lee. They are part of our heritage.

Unfortunately for the school, these traditions have to be
enforced as rules. One member of the freshman class has al-
ready gone on record as one of the few who feel that the school
traditions are “mickey mouse.’ We feel that such a man has
no place in this institution. We trust that he is the exception to
the rule. We are sure that his opinions will change through his
association with his classmates and the rest of the student body.
We plead with the class of 1964 to respect the heritage of its
university and make the very unpleasant job of the Assimilation
Committee more pleasant. We are proud of the traditions of our
school. We expect the class of 1964 to uphold them and to
carry them on.

 

Injustice to Athletes?

In the past there have been many criticisms of the Physical
Education Department here at Washington and Lee. We feel
that most of these have been unfair. They have been made by
students who have had some personal grudge against some
member of the PE staff. We realize that these men have certain
duties and obligations which their jobs require them to fulfill,
and feel that the students should do as much as possible to co-
operate with them.

We also feel that the policy of the PE department and the
University concerning freshman and sophomore athletes who
are injured while representing the school on freshman or var-
sity teams is unfair. Suppose, for example, that a sophomore
athlete contracted a serious knee injury during a mid-season
baseball game. In this case, we will assume that the injury is
serious enough to prevent the boy from further participation
in the sport or any physical education class. The boy would
then be given a grade of I for the semester and required to take
the PE course over again his junior year.

We realize that the boy is getting “a break” in that he is not
given an F for the semester and that his cuts are not taken away
for the next semester. We understand too that the coaches and
members of the PE staff are required by rule of the university
to give the boy the grade of I. We do not question the men who
give the grade. We question the rule which requires the grade.

Why should a student who has had the initiative to par-
ticipate in a sport under our system of nonsubsidization be in
effect penalized for an injury which he would not have received
had he remained with his less ambitious and spirited brethren
within the relatively safe and snug confines of Doremus Gym?

Lexington Is Praised

By GERRY OULLETTE
and WYNN KINTZ

Our first column of the year is |
dedicated to the newcomers in the)
Lexington area. From our past ex-
perience, both fortunate and unfor-
tunate, we shall strive to outline
some of the attractions found in
the “Shrine of the South.”

First things first. Permit us to
point out an outstanding feature of
Lexington: its geographical location.
The site of the town is within one
hour’s drive from three fine young
ladies’ schools. This feature, along
with the great number of student
cars on campus, makes a weekend
extremely bearable after the grind
of six school days. An added incen-
tive derives also from the geograph-
ical situation. The three girls’ schools
are mutually non-fraternizing, con-
sequently the W&L student with wit
and charm can easily be the wielder
of three interesting strings simul-
taneously.

We return to our muttons. Lex-
ington boasts several distinguish-
ed landmarks: Lee Chapel, Stone-
wall Jackson’s Home, the Univer-
sity, and the Institute for the
militarily minded. In addition there
are churches of practically every
major denomination (and others)
found here, and Main Street is
dotted with filling stations and
banks. Let us not omit a relatively
new landmark, the Slater System.

 

All academically minded benefit!
from the excellent atmosphere of this |
town. There lies at the heart of Lex-|
ington a love for trees, grass, flowers,
and silence. Occasionally, however,
some clean-cut American college |
fun is permitted, and early Sunday
morning is spent by many Lexing-
ton residents cleaning the debris.

Let us mention Lexington’s pets.
Here the dogs are taught to under-
stand and respect the students’ cur-
ricula and study habits. Indeed,
Lexingtonians can well be proud of
their educated pets. May we sug-
gest that more publicity be given

| “light”

 

this point of interest.

ties. Both theatre houses strive to

accommodate the students with the|

latest from Hollywood. Drug stores
and others carry a complete line of
reading material, catering
to the fancy of all. There are several
grills which amiably serve their cus-
tomers without making much-to-do
about identification. And if one is
not yet content, there is always that
place across from the State Theatre;
but a word of warning: the gentle-
man in the little green coat prompt-
ly locks the doors at 6 p.m.

Lexington has still one attrac-
tion that we find most pleasant:
its delightful climate. Of course,
there are winters when it snows,
and it can rain for a week without
stopping, but who among us will
feel bitter remembering the fine
weather during the other seven
months?

Now that we have given you some
insight into future expectations, we
welcome you to the Lexington met-
ropolitan area, and wish you a happy
stay.

The final whistle has once again
sounded, and the excitment and con-
fusion of another Rush Week has
ended. Fortunate indeed are those
men chosen by a fraternal order to
become one of the “brothers.” Mem-
bership in a fraternity has always
been a part of campus life, and par-
ticularly here at Washington and
Lee. We congratulate the newly

pledged members and wish them|

continued success.

To those men not making a fra-
ternity may we address the following
remarks. True you were not selected
this Rush Week to become a fra-
ternity member, but what really have
you lost? Is there any reason to
feel strange or left out? Absolutely
not...In missing a fraternity bid,
you have gained the right to form
your own opinions, without internal
pressures, also you have gained the
opportunity to extend your acquain-
tances beyond a confined group, and,
if tradition holds true, you are one
step ahead towards becoming a more

Winning Teams Make Demands
That Carry Beyond Wilson Field

By BILL ROBERTS

Washington and Lee football has
changed quite a bit in three years.
There are the obvious changes—we
are winning more games, we have
more men on the squad, more people
attending games, more prestige for
football players, the whole list of
changes which attest that our non-
subsidized program does_ indeed
“work.” Another change has taken
place, one not mentioned in the
newspaper writeups and one only
hinted at in the published remarks of
coaches and administration. The
Washington and Lee program is fin-
ally demanding the quality which
makes a winning football team—
a near-total commitment to football
from the team members.

By a near-total commitment to
football, I of course don’t mean
that the W&L football team is a
group of animals whose sole aim
and desire in life is to play foot-
ball. But I do mean that if it
comes to a point where football's
interest will be seriously pre-
judiced by studies, by the fra-
ternity, by dating, or by any of
the other multitude of facets of
Washington and Lee life, that foot-
ball will always win out.

This change is a subtle but not
imperceptible one. It may have be-
come more obvious this week when
football players left fraternity ball
sessions earlier, when they showed
generally less zeal than their broth-
ers in preparing for what was for
many houses a crucial rush week.
And the brothers of the ball players

This column, the first in a rather
unpromising series, is written as a
welcome—or perhaps a warning—to
the current crop of beanie-wearers.

Since the freshmen won't want to
miss a single event of the action-
packed year ahead, we decided to
point out in advance a few of the
things that will happen. The diligent
freshmen should endeavor to mem-
orize these events now, as there will
be very little mention of them when
they occur.

According to a reputable source
(a wrinkled gypsy woman who in-
terprets flights of starlings around
Old George), we may look for
such things as these:

First, a set of rules will be brought
before the Interfraternity Council
to alleviate some of the time-honored
practices of Hell Week. The mere
fact that these rules are necessary
is a sorry reflection on our maturity.

Since the fraternity representa-
tives last spring specified that these

 

passed with little modification. The
greater difficulty will come in per-
suading individual fraternities, and
their individual members, to abide by
these rules four months from now.

When IFC president Dave Lef-
kowitz told the freshmen, “Hell
Week is a thing of the past,” he
was reflecting several months of
determined work by some concern-
ed fraternity men, His statement
suggests that, this year, the IFC

(Continued on page 4)

showed more willingness to make this
concession in the hopes of a strong
General showing on the gridiron.

munity as a whole has made this!

senior about the change in student

 

 

 

 

cule and private sympathy. Now
students care whether we win or
lose. Some teachers are reputed to
favor football players, just as others
are reported to favor Southerners,
or Dekes, or what have you. Week-
before-last when the freshmen were
eating one of the first meals in the
commons, the varsity team, still tak-
ing preseason training meals there,
stepped to the front of a line of
several hundred freshmen to eat.
Neither the varsity team nor the
freshmen questioned this order of
precedence.

I believe this change in attitude
is what produces the football
which led the Richmond Times-
Dispatch to call W&L the state's
top small college eleven. But Ran-
dolph-Macon and Hampden-Syd-
ney are willing and able to dis-
pute that distinction. And it is a
rather dubious distinction at that.
How many people at W&L are sat-
isfied to have the best small-
college team in Virginia?

To rise to greater heights we need
quite a few things. We need more and
better football players. We'll demand
more of those more and better play-

ers. They must accept a_ bigger
challenge than the 1960 Generals
accept.

And what is the challenge for a
boy with size and speed and ability?
The challenge lies in a commitment
one step further than the one we
make now. There will only be a few
more hours per week on the prac-
tice field, a few more hours before
a movie screen, a few more hours
of meetings, a few more hours of
sleep a little more attention to ones
diet and activities, a few more times

When Radio Washington and Lee)
takes the air waves a week from to-
morrow night, it will be setting out
on its first full academic year of
broadeasting.

The idea for such a series of
programs is not new. People con-
nected with the radio and televi-
sion part of the journalism depart-
ment have been talking in general
terms of something like what we
have now for years.

It is the outgrowth of one pro-
gram, “Kaleidoscope,” which was be-
gun in 1959, and has been heard
every Thursday night since then.
From this program, Bill Ashworth, a
June graduate, formed Radio Wash-
ington and Lee last spring. It drew
personnel from Home Edition, “Ka-
leidoscope,” and also included a large
number of people never before con-
nected with radio at W&L.

From the beginning, Radio Wash-
ington and Lee has covered almost
every aspect of a listener’s tastes.

Monday night’s “Pro Musica” of-
fers the listener the best in strictly
classical music. Tuesday night falls
away a little from the most serious

 

type music with the program
“Concert,” by playing music gen-

Allen To Head Radio W&L’S
Broadcast To Varied Tastes

Wednesday night’s “Patterns” of-
fers a combination of popular music,
in the traditional styles, not rock
and roll, blended with the more pop-
ular type jazz.

Thursday nights, Radio W&L pre-
sents two half hour programs, dif-
fering from the hour-long offerings
the other four nights.

“Point-Center” is based on lo-
cal people, places, things, and
happenings in and around Lexing-
ton. The other half hour is held by
“Kaleidoscope,” the program on
which, in a sense, you might hear
anything. Last year’s “Kaleido-
scope” ranged from the takeoff on
“Monitor” called “Monster,” to a
documentary type production
covering the Civil War in words
and music.

Friday night offers “Jazz Echoes,”
a program devoted to all kinds of
jazz, progressive, modern, and Dixie-
land.

This year, Radio Washington and
Lee offers the same lineup of shows,
from the first words of “Pro Musica”
on Monday night to the last words
and notes of “Jazz Echoes” on Fri-
day night. As far as is known at this

| time, the programs will keep the
erally referred to as semi-classical. |

Washington and Lee has always
prided itself on treating its students
like adults. In the catalogue we
write proudly of our system of stu-
dent self-government, the honor sys-
tem and other examples of maturity
of our student body. However, on
the ODK bulletin board an incon-
spicuous notice has been posted
which is contrary to the impression
we are trying to make. It simply an-
nounces that anyone who takes two
over-cuts in a course will get an
automatic “F” in that course.

This form of compulsion, even
more drastic than the old “Final
Absence Probation” system, is more
suited to a prep school or military
academy than to a free university.

One of the minor consequences
of this sort of system is the petty
;malingering that goes on at the in-
| firmary. A major consequence is
' thet we fail to give students a taste
of the responsibility they eventually
must take when they leave. This is
so because the absence rule is arbi-
trary, bearing only an indirect rela-
tion with the ultimate purpose of
the University, which is to teach.

sors. The automatic “F” is an aca-
demic rubber truncheon used by the
administrative police.

Another eTect of the present sys-
tem is to place too much emphasis
on dull-witted attendance, so much
so that to many, college is a place
where you have to attend classes,
rather than a place in which you
learn.

Many systems have been proposed
to replace the one now in use, but I
would like to offer just one more
out of my experionce as a class-
cutter and attender:

Everyone, no matter what their
average, class standing, or proba-
tionary status, should have one week
of cuts. Those with a “C” average
or better should be permitted a
minimum of two weeks of cuts with
no penalty, and as many more as
each individual professor may be
willing to permit. A man who is cut-
ting classes beyond reason can be
called in and warned, with various
penalties attending his failure to
heed the warning. A system like this
will remove the arbitrariness from
the absence regulations,

Along with this change, infirmary-
excused cuts could be eliminated,
and cuts resulting from sickness
could be treated just as any other

| cut. Cuts aren’t a vacation, nor a

privilege, but something to use in
emergencies. Those reforms would
end the stretching to which the hon-
or system is presently subjected.

W&L Faces Centre Saturday in Opening Game

Generals Are Ready To Cure
Some Of Last Season’s IIls

As the 1960 football season nears
the beginning for the Washington
and Lee Generals, the prospects for
a sexson to surpass or to at least
equal last year’s record seem very
good.

With 28 lettermen plus several
more boys with limited varsity ex-
perience and fifteen promising soph-
emores on the roster, there will be
no leck of depth as has been the
problem in former years. Every po-
sition is three deep with highly
qualified boys with some even four
and five deep.

Depth being no problem, the
chief concern of the team this year
will be that the teams which beat
W&L last year will probably be
even stronger, and those which
the Generals defeated will cer-
tainly be stronger than the off-
form status in which the team
caught them last year. In addition
Johns Hopkins, which had a 7-1
record last season, has been added
to this year’s schedule to toughen
things up a bit.

The one asset which the Generals
lost last year, and the effects of
which will be noticed greatly this
year is Jack Groner’s passing. Gron-
er was not only a superb passer but
was also a great pyschological spur
to the team. However, as he was an
asset, he was also a crutch upon
which the other boys on the team
depended perhaps too much. Coach
Lee McLaughlin hopes that this year
the Blue and White will develop a
more balanced offense increasing the
reliability of the ground game.

Frosh Football
Squad Looking
Good This Year

Even though it is really too early
to make any definite assumptions,
the prospects for the freshman foot-
ball team this year having a suc-
cessful season are even better than
lost year’s. Under the direction of
Coaches Hal Bates and Bill King,
the 37 boys have been working hard
to surpass last year’s record.

The six-game schedule which in-
cludes three home and three away
games will have a new replacement
on it this year with the addition of
Hargrave Military Academy, which
takes the place of Fishburn. The
team’s first encounter will be with
Hargrave on Wilson Field Friday.

In several positions there are boys
who seem to have much potential,
and especially at the halfback slot
with Henry Sackett, a 175 pound
Lynchburg, Va. boy. On the line the
coaches have placed a mighty 285
pounder, Doug Powers, at guard.
Others who have stood out so far
are Charles Savage, an all-stater
from Alabama, Sidney Butler, and
Ed Croft.

Varsity coach McLaughlin and his
staff have been working hard to re-
cruit these boys, and they seem to
have done an excellent job. Of course
any freshman team has to remain a
question mark until after the first
few encounters, but indications so
far seem to point to a winning sea-
son.

Another ill which this year’s team
hopes to remedy is the Generals’
road jinx which was finally broken
-vith the Washington U. game in St.
Louis, which W&L won by a score of
35-26. This year the team will have
five away games as opposed to last
year’s four.

Heading the Generals this year
in the backfield will be Steve Sut-
tle, a Texas junior who was the
first unit quarterback last year.
Suttle has good defense playing
ability and can pass canably. Rob-
in Wood who lacks the size that
Suttle has also plays good defense
and is the top strategist on the
field. Others who will probably see
action in the quarterback slot are
Chuck Lane, who is out with an
injury now, and Phil Sharp.

At the halfback position Bob
Funkhouser, one of the tri-captains,
will be playing at left half for most
of the games, while at right half will
be Jim Russ, who carries the ball

little, but had a 4.2 average on 23*
tries last year. Jim Hickey, who is
second string halfback, is another
player out with an injury, and it
is doubtful that he will see action
this week. Based on spring practice
showings, Joe Hess will be filling the
fullback position this year. Jack Ko-
walski is another second stringer
who is injured and he will probably
be out for the year. Tommy Keesee,
who was the freshman team’s best
back last year, is a sophomore hope-
ful in the fullback slot.

On the line spectators will be see-
ing much of Courtney Mauzy and
Terry Fohs, the other two tri-cap-
tains at center. At guard there are
more than enough to fill the berth,
but the four that stand out are Bill
Willes, Barton Dick, Tommy Good-
win and George Cruger, Graham
Fulton, a letterman who missed last
season, Bob Lewis, Malcolm Brown-
lee, and Bill Wheeler will all play
the tackle slot with help from soph-
omore Dave Munroe. The end posi-
tions will be rounded out with Ned
Hobbs, Rosie Page, and Bill Roberts.

Soccer Team To

By BOB HART

The W&L soccer team kicks off
its 1960 schedule with a home game
Sept. 26 against Pfeiffer College. Ac-
cording to Coach Joe Lyles the
team will be playing one of the
toughest schedules in the country,
facing such competition as Duke,
North Carolina, and Lynchburg.

The team counts nine lettermen
returning, with co-captains Dave
Knight and Frank Smith heading the
list. A goalie, two fullbacks, one
wing, and a halfback will not be
returning this year from last year’s
starting team. To fill these spots
Lyles will be depending on last year’s
returning lettermen along with a few
of this year’s promising freshmen.

Steve Hawkins is returning to
the squad after a year’s layoff and
is expected to strengthen the team
at the wing position. Freshman
Breck Alexander, an all New
England fullback in prep school last
year, is expected to see some ac-
tion on the varsity squad. Other

Begin Schedule

freshmen are Andy Hyde, Tain
Tompkins, Tom Green, and An-
thony Antoniades from Greece.

Although he cannot give a defi-
nite prediction as to how the team
will do this year, Coach Lyle says
that he has been particularly pleased
with the hustle that the team has
shown thus far. The team has not
yet scrimmaged, but hopes to do so
in the early part of the week.

The probable starting line-up for
the 1960 team will be goalie, Steve
Paley or Andy Hyde; fullbacks,
Dunlop Ecker, Harvey Preston or
Breck Alexander; halfbacks, Frank
Smith, Bob Pagano and Bill Out-
man; Center Forward, Dave Knight;
Inside, Jim Starkey, Charlie Begg;
Wings, Steve Hawkins or Mike Keat-
ing, Dick Herman or George Arcer.

 

The Fall Tennis Tournament ap-
plications are now being received by
Coach Washburn. Deadline for en-

 

tries is Wednesday, Sept. 21. Appli-

ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH, DEAR
FRIENDS

Today, if I am a little misty, who can blame me? For today I
begin my seventh year of writing columns for the makers of
Marlboro Cigarettes.

Seven years! Can it be possible? It seems only yesterday I
walked into the Marlboro offices, my knickers freshly pressed,
my cowlick wetted down, my oilcloth pencil box clutched in
my tiny hand. “Sirs,” I said to the makers of Marlboro—as
handsome an aggregation of men as you will find in a month
of Sundays, as agreeable as the cigarettes they make—mild yet
hearty, robust yet gentle, flip-top yet soft pack—‘Sirs,” I
said to this assemblage of honest tobacconists, “I have come to
write a column for Marlboro Cigarettes in college newspapers
across the length and breadth of this great free land of America.”

We shook hands then—silently, not trusting ourselves to
speak—and one of the makers whipped out a harmonica and we
sang sea chanties and bobbed for apples and played “Run,
Sheep, Run,” and smoked good Marlboro Cigarettes until the
campfire had turned to embers.

“What will you write about in your column?” asked one of
the makers whose name is Trueblood Strongheart.

  

LV emp

= Ahold d is eck i i} ii faba”? ie

“About the burning issues that occupy the lively minds of
college America,” I replied. “About such vital questions as:
Should the Student Council have the power to levy taxes?
Should proetors be armed? Should coeds go out for football?”

“And will you say a kind word from time to time about
Marlboro Cigarettes,” asked one of the makers whose name is
Honor Bright.

“Why, bless you, sirs,” I replied, chuckling silverly, “there
is no other kind of word except a kind word to say about
Marlboro Cigarettes—the filter cigarette with the unfiltered
taste—that happy combination of delicious tobacco and ex-
clusive selectrate filter—that loyal companion in fair weather or
foul—that joy of the purest ray serene.”

There was another round of handshakes then and the makers
squeezed my shoulders and I squeezed theirs and then we each
squeezed our own. And then I hied me to my typewriter and
began the first of seven years of columning for the makers of
Marlboro Cigarettes.

 

And today as I find myself once more at my typewriter, once
more ready to begin a new series of columns, perhaps it would
be well to explain my writing methods. I use the term “writing
methods” advisedly because I am, above all things a methodical
writer. I do not wait for the muse; I work every single day of

the year, Sundays and holidays included. I set myself a daily
quota and I don’t let anything prevent me from achieving it.
My quota, to be sure, is not terribly difficult to attain (it is,
in fact, one word per day) but the important thing is that I do
it every single day. This may seem to you a grueling schedule
but you must remember that some days are relatively easy—

for example, the days on which I write “the” or “a’’, On these
days I can usually finish my work by noon and can devote the
rest of the day to happy pursuits like bird-walking, monopoly,
and smoking Marlboro Cigarettes.

The makers of Marlboro are happy to bring you another
year of Max Shulman’s free-wheeling, uncensored column
—and are also happy to bring Marlboro Cigarettes, and for
non-filter smokers—mild, flavorful Philip Morris.

Medical Cuts Questioned

(Continued from page 2)

The initial change-over, were this
system or one like it, to be adopted,
might result in a mild spree of cut-
ting, but this is to be expected
any time you remove restraint. Other
schools managed very well with lib-
eral cut systems, and it certainly
does not speak well for our student
body that we are afraid Washington
and Lee can’t.

Were Washington and Lee to
change the absence regulations, it
could then more easily accomplish
its proper business, which is to teach,
not to hand out arbitrary failures.

a reasonable fast backfield which
will concentrate not so much on an
aerial game and do more ground
work this season. The team’s depth
should provide it with three com-

petent squads that will pose a
threat to any of the schools on

How these and other changes will

Many of the persons associated
with Radio Washington and Lee
graduated last June. In doing so
they left many positions open on
the staff of Radio W&L for inter-

Another W&L phenomenon need-

political system. It is fast becoming
traditional.

almost committed themselves last

the minority party at one point was
ready to campaign on a platform of
reform.

It is possible that, if the majority
party feels unshakably secure this
year, some concessions may be made
through the Executive Committee.
It is also possible that the minority
party, tired of mere complaints, will
enter the arena with a vengence, and
win some elections by hard, honest
politicking.

A third area of mild controversy
may arise if the IFC reopens de-
bate on an extended Rush Week.

to be a strong sentiment—rapidly

other reason than that it represents
the status quo.
