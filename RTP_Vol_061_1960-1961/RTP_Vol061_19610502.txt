| Debators Split 2-2

 

(In Northern Meet
,

Facing the strongest debate teams
in the East and Mid-West, Bill
Buice and Bill Boardman of the
W&L Debate Team came out with

a respectable 2-2 record. At a

N.Y.U. Invitational Debate Tourna-

 

 

} Buice, Boardman Excell

ment in New York City over the |

past weekend, Holy Cross won top
honors as the tournament champion.
Holy Cross which defeated national
champions Harvard, and Kenyon
College, a strong debate school
from the corn belt, beat Buice and
Boardman.

Rutgers and Iona, the teams to
beat Holy Cross, were both beaten
by Buice and Boardman.

In persuasive speaking, W&L’s
only entries—Bill Noell and Al
Eckes—came in eighth and _ thir-
teenth respectively out of a field of
53.
Thirty-six schools from the East,
Mid-West and the South took part
in the two-day affair at Washington
Square.

This weekend the spring debate
season will end for Washington and
Lee at Columbia, South Carolina, in
the tournament for the championship
of the Atlantic Coast Conference.
Washington and Lee is one of the
few non-conference schools to be
extended a bid to participate. In
this competition such old rivals as
Virginia, Duke and Clemson will
probably meet.

May 8-22 Busy Week For Troubs;

Will Present ‘Man Of Destiny’
Plus ‘A Marriage Proposal’

By TOM LYBASS

A selection from two of the most
prominent authors of modern come-
dy will be offered by the Trouba-
dours in their next productions of
Shaw’s “The Man of Destiny” and
Chekhov’s “A Marriage Proposal.”
Both of these one-act plays will
be presented at 8:30 p.m. on May
8-12 at the Troubadour Theater.

The first play on the Troubadour
bill is “A Marriage Proposal.” Called
“a joke in one act,” the play differs
from “The Man of Destiny” in being
more farcical. Unlike Shaw’s play,
it lacks a sustained plot, subtle sit-
uation, the actors speak and move
only to incite laughter.

For the three rather spirited roles,
Dr. Keith Shillington, Miss Julia
Coates, and Mac McClung have
been selected. Dr. Shillington appears
as the elderly, pompous but affable
landowner with the improbable name
of Stephen Stepanovitch Chubukov.
His unmarried daughter, Natalia,
acted by Miss Coates, is sought in
marriage by Ivan Vasselevitch Lo-
mov, who is portrayed by Mac Mc-
Clung.

Slater And Couch Elected
To Lead Political Parties

Political campaigning for class of-
fices opens this week under new
party chairmen. Spud Slater was
elected chairman of the Indepen-
dent Party at a meeting Thursday
night.

At a University Party Caucus last
night, the Big Clique elected Gran-
tham Couch chairman for the com-
ing year.

“The student mandate in last
week’s election,” stated Slater, “was
a clear decision in favor of certain
basic issues. The Independent Party
intends to pursue these issues by pro-
viding nominees for class offices who
will best serve the student body
and sincerely devote themselves to
putting these platform proposals into
effect.”

SENIORS

 

 

Caps and gowns will go on sale
Wednesday -Monday from 9:30-1:00
in the Co-op.

SWMSFC members will contact
seniors in their fraternity houses.

“Twelfth Night” and Gremio in “The
Taming of the Shrew,” Dr. Shilling-
ton is not inexperienced in theatri-
eal work. Explaining why he is
starring in “A Marriage Proposal,”
he said, “I like to play buffoons
and jackasses. Also, I always have
my coming out in the spring.”

A singer in the choir of the R. E.
Lee Episcopal Church, Miss Julia
Coates finds the major difficulty of
her role in voice control, being re-
quired several times to scream hys-
terically. Miss Coates, a graduate
of Mary Washington College, teach-
es eighth grade English at Lexing-
ton High School.

“The Man of Destiny” fills out the
rest of the evening of fine drama
the Troubadours will present. In-
tended to satirize the heroic figure
of Napoleon, “The Man of Destiny”
offers an excellent opportunity for
experienced actors to display their
roles. The two supporting roles,
held by John Dunnell and Andy
Adelson, are important because of
the contrast they offer to the main
characters, Napoleon and the Strange
Lady.

To John Dunnell falls the
of the impetuous lieutenant,
personifies the revolutionary zeal
of Napoleon’s time. A person who
speaks before he acts, the lieutenant
is eminently qualified to rush in
where angels fear to tread. The lieu-
tenant is the eleventh character John
Dunnell has played since his acting
career began five years ago. Recall-
ing his first role, as the eleventh
juror in “The Twelve Angry men,”
John commented, “Before that play,
I was afraid to get up and talk to
anyone.”- Most of the characters he
has played have been romantic he-
roes or dashing courtiers. About this
John could only say, “Somehow I
always end up with tights on.”

Giusseppe, the obsequious Italian
inn keeper with the “soul of a
servant” is acted by Andy Adelson.
Andy’s memorable appearance in the
last Troubadour production, “Henry
IV,” as the valet who asks for
a cigarette, was his first production.
An English major with a special
interest in Shaw, Andy is delighted
with his role.

All of the roles in “The Man of
Destiny” demand not only brilliance
of characterization and polish of
manner but also vitality of speech.
The major problem facing the cast
is control of the. Shavian rhythms,
especially with regard to delivering

part
who

 

long and subtly articulated phrases
without breaking them up.

 

As set by tradition, it will be the
last parade of the year and, as usual,
has been designated President’s Day
Parade. It will be the second such
parade that Dr. Cole has participated
in since becoming President of
Washington and Lee.

Among the several awards being
given is the Department of the
Army Superior Cadet Ribbon,
awarded to one member of each of
the four classes for “outstanding
leadership, scholastic achievement,
and proficiency in military training.
This year’s medal will go to senior

Commander; junior Charles E. Dow-
man, Company “B”; sophomore John
C. Thurmond, Co. D.; and freshman
William B. Ogilvie, Jr., of Co. “E.”

Glee Ciub Gives
Spring Concerts

By RICK BELSER
Friday Reporter

The Washington and Lee Glee
Club presented its Spring Concert
Wednesday night in Lee Chapel. The
program, which showed sparse stu-
dent attendance, was composed of
songs from the fall concert and sev-
eral new additions. Under the di-
rection of Professor Robert Stewart,
the Glee Club opened with the Alma
Mater, “College Friendships.” The
second and third selections, “Good
Fellows Be Merry” by Bach and
“Widerspruch,” were much improved
from the fall Parents’ Weekend
concert. In “Libera Me,” from the
“Requiem” by Faure, and “Land-
sighting” by Grieg, freshman soloist
John Baker gave an outstanding
performance.

The second part of the program
was presented by the Westhampton
College Choir, under the direction
of James Erb. The Westhampton girls
opened with the lilting “Sound the
Trumpet” by Purcell and followed
with the “Messe Basse” by Faure.
To round out the first half of the
evening’s concert, the John A.
Graham Brass Choir, directed by
Professor Stewart, offered “Sonata
No. 2” by Pezel and “Prelude and
Fugue” by King.

The W&L Glee Club began the
second half of the concert with “As
I Ride By,” an amusing ballad writ-
ten by Kernochan and sung by so-
loist Sam Channell. The two final
numbers were “Come to Me, Bend
to Me,” from “Brigadoon” and I
Could Have Danced All Night” from
“My Fair Lady.” W&L’s freshman
pianist, Warren Hopkins, gave his
usual fine performance.

To close out the evening, the
Westhamption Choir did “Slumber
Sound” by Rossi and two trios from
“The Magic Flute” by Mozart. How-
ever, Director Erb had saved the
best for last. The girls rendition of
a suite from “La Vie Parisienne” by
Offenbach kept the audience laugh-
ing from beginning to end. This final
number alone would have made the
concert worth while for many people
who did not attend. Both directors
and both groups were disappointed
at the poor attendance.

Following the concert, a reception
was held in duPont Hall for the
Westhampton girls and the W&L
Glee Club. Everyone seemed pleased
by the performance.

The Glee Club left today
tis annual Spring Tour. It
return on Thursday, May 4. In all,
four concerts are planned, includ-
ing a return engagement at West-
hampton College in Richmond.

Five Entries Merit
1961 Mahan Awards

The English department announced
today that five students have been
chosen for Mahan Awards in crea-
tive writing.

Paul Van Avery, Ronald Alenstein,
and Bond Johnson won prose awards.
William Chaplin and Chester White,
Jr., were the recipients of verse
awards.

Van Avery received the freshman
prose award for his story, “The
Bridge.”

Two junior prose awards were
made to Johnson for his short
story, “Garlands of Wisteria,” and
to Alenstein for his short story,
“Half-Sick of Shadows.” No soph-
omore prose award was made this
year.

Chaplain received his verse award
for two short lyrics and a dramatic
monologue he submitted in the
competition.

White’s verse award, his second,
went for a collection of seven
lyrics which the judges said “showed
unusual facility in exact images.”

This year’s competition for Ma-
han awards drew 12 prose entries
and 11 verse entries. The judges
said they were particularly pleased
at the number of students now
writing serious verse.

“Both in numbers and quality,
this year’s was better work than
we've had before,” said Dr. A. Ross
Borden, acting head of the English
department.

The Mahan Awards were estab-
lished under the will of the late
George A. Mahan, of Hannibal, Mo.
Recipients may take a $100 remis-
sion in fees from the University, or
$60 in cash.

There are generally two freshman
prose awards, and one prose award
each in the sophomore and junior
classes, with one verse award open
to any sophomore, or junior. But the
committee may choose not to make
an award in any of the divisions,
or shift the awards from one di-
vision to another, where the quality

 

of the entries demands it.

Pressure On Party System
Released

The results of the past election have shown that there is
nothing inherently wrong with the party system as it exists at
Washington and Lee. Officially, the University Party still main-
tains a sizeable advantage as far as the number of party mem-
bers is concerned. At present the UP has 471 members, and a
majority of some hundred votes over the Independent group.

The events of the past week have shown that this obstacle is
not insurmountable. If the minority party is willing to offer
the most capable and the most qualified candidates at their
disposal, and to organize its members into a super political
organization, it can win any election. As we see it, the pressure
has been taken off of the party system and placed upon the

parties and their candidates.

In addition, the past election has brought home the fact
that any party that expects to have any of its candidates elected
must cater to the various student interest groups on campus
(the Law School, the non-fraternity group, etc.). We believe
that in the future both parties will have to include in their
slates candidates from these various groups in both the big
seven and the class elections. It is our prediction that if both
parties do not heed this warning, they will find themselves look-

ing in from the outside.

The election campaigns, at least in the near future, will be
lively. They will deal with issues which are of paramount inter-
est to the students of this school. It will be interesting to see
what extent the issues in the past big seven elections will affect

the up-coming class elections.

With regard to “APATHY” it is interesting to note that
the Ring-tum Phis of a decade ago were filled with columns,
editorials and articles bemoaning the lack of student “‘interest”’
and calling for major changes within our system. Most of the
proposals died on the vine. A conservative reaction set in.
There is the old axiom about history repeating itself. Will
it hold true in the present case? We hope not!

Prior to election week the main issue of contention seems
to have been our honor system. Neither campaign platform
contained any proposal for major revision in this area. We
sincerely hope that no major change will be made. We have
the utmost faith in our system as it now exists.

All big three candidates seemed to agree that the trouble
lay not within the system, but rather in the lack of information
concerning the system. The obvious answer, then, is more and
better indoctrination of students into the system. We are con-
fident that this will be taken care of by the newly elected officers.

 

Gray Charges
EC Members

Dear Editor:

I believe that in view of the
questions which I am raising in this
statement there should be an in-
vestigation into the activities of the
individuals responsible for the situ-
ations dealt with. I believe that the
Student Body Constitution has been
violated too extensively both in
fact and in spirit to ignore what has
happened.

1, Unlawful change of the Consti-
tution: In Article V, Paragraph A,
number 5 the word prosecutor as it
appears in the Handbook of Student
Government has been changed in the
recent printing of the Constitution to
investigator. The Student Body has
not been informed of this change
or asked for its approval. The per-
son or persons responsible has vio-
lated his oath of office and is sub-
ject to a request for his resignation
and, it seems to me, trial for vio-
lation of the Honor System for lying.

2. The EC has failed to give prop-
er publicity to its stated belief that
it has the power to change the
Handbook statement of the Honor
System and Procedure. It has de-
liberately mislead the Student Body
in publicizing its proposed insertion
regarding legal counsel at Public
Trial as an amendment up for stu-
dent vote. It had already been in fact
passed by your own interpretation.

3. The EC has failed to give prop-
er publicity to its change in the
statement of paragraph 3 on page
19 of the Handbook.

4. The EC has failed to give proper
publicity as required in the Consti-
tution to the proposed amendment
to the Constitution which would
have changed the amendment pro-
cedure.

5. The EC failed to make proper
provision for the representation of
the Law School at the nominating
convention, though it is clear that as
a part of the Student Body it was
entitled to such under the Constitu-
tion.

6. A statement has been made by
a member of the Student Body that
EC members at last year’s ROTC
Summer Camp declared that the
Honor System did not cover Summer

EC Replies
To Charges

On Monday, May 1, 1961, Grayfred
Gray appeared before the Executive
Committee and submitted the letter
appearing on this page. The Execu-
tive Committee would like to make
the following response to each point
of Mr. Gray’s letter.

1. It is the opinion of the Com-
mittee that the change of the word
“prosecutor” to “investigator” rep-
resented a procedural rather than a
substantive change. For some years
the functions of this individual dur-
ing honor trials have been those of
an investigator rather than a pros-
ecutor. The Executive Committee
has the prerogative to change the
procedure for honor trials by a 2/3
vote of the standing committee. The
Executive Committe has therefore
acted to replace the word with one
more in keeping with the establish-
ed procedure.

2. We feel that Mr. Gray is im-
puting motives to the Committee that
it did not possess. The change is
purely tentative subject to the ap-
proval of the student body. This
change was approved at the referen-
dum by a vote of more than two-
thirds of the student body.

3. Since the change made in the
explanation of the honor system by
the Executive Committee was of a
clarifying nature the Committee did
not feel it necessary to advise the
student body formally of such action.
Here is the above-mentioned change:

“If a student leaves the Univer-
sity to avoid facing the Honor
Trial, jurisdiction is retained by
the Student Body to investigate
the case...”

The correction is “If a student
leaves the University prior to ex-
ercising an option to avoid facing
the Honor Trial, jurisdiction is re-
tained by the Executive Commit-
tee...”

4. In failing to follow to the letter
the procedure for publication of
proposed amendments by not pub-
lishing the amendment on the Stu-
dent Union bulletin board, the
Executive Committee was technically
at fault. However, the Committee did
publish the proposed amendment
upon the Payne Hall bulletin board,

A Dog’s Life
At Wooffle U.

By ED WEBSTER

This is a story about a beagle
named Thurber, who lived in Up-
per Muttclair, N. J. He was just a
young fellow, but his father had
already taught him most of the es-
sentials of life: sipping Scotch, flirt-
ing with the ladies, talking politics,
and playing golf.

In order to become a successful
dog, Thurber went south to Wooffle
University, where he soon became
assimilated into his new surround-
ings. He was especially relieved to
hear the dean say: “We have just
one rule: All our dogs are gentle-
men.”

“Every Wooffle dog is a gentleman.
That means me!” Thurber mused
happily, admiring his new tweed
sport coat in the mirror. Thurber
came of a good family, all of whom
were gentlemen. Especially his fath-
er, who was richer than all the
rest of them put together.

One Saturday night, a cute little
poodle from Hollins told Thurber
that she didn’t think he was much
of a gentleman. Thurber hurried to
the library the next afternoon, hop-
ing to find something that would an-
swer her criticism.

All he could find was a dusty
treatise written several centuries
ago by an obscure English terrier.
It went like this:

“The gentleman is as far above
the ordinary man, as the man is
above the boy. The boy delights in
playing with toys; the man delights
in toying with his fellow beings;
but the true gentleman, being ob-
livious to external diversions, takes
his delight in harnessing his intel-
lect and letting it lead him to high-
er endeavours.

“The gentleman is not swayed
by his companions, nor does he
depend upon them for amusement
or flattery. He chooses his friends
discreetly, yet he is able to com-
port himself with ease and grace
in the company of all manners of
people. Dignified without being
tedious, reserved without being
cold, the gentleman naturally
adopts a manner and an appear-
ance befitting his situation.

“The strength of the gentleman
lies in the integrity of his own
mind, Although he is humble and
tolerant and unpretentious, he is
never afraid to defend the truth of
his convictions.

“The worth of the gentleman lies
in his ability to perceive himself in
proportion to the rest of the world.
To the infant, the world is a soft
presence which devotes itself to his
comforts; to the boy, the world is
a great playing-field where he
may seek amusement. Many are
the adults who have never put
away these childish ideas; but the
hallmark of manhood must be a
sense of obligation to one’s fel-
low men. When the man has bal-
anced his concern for society with
his duties to his own intellectual
integrity, he becomes a gentleman.

“The gentleman is versatile in
his talents, and temperate in his
habits. He is sincere, and honour-
able, and just, and considerate.
Whatever befalls him, whether tri-
umph or disaster, he maintains his
equanimity and does not allow
these fortunes to cloud his vision.
From this idea of proportion, he
derives a sense of humor which
often leads him to laugh at his
own follies. ...”

Thurber closed the book sadly.
Somehow these words seemed very
distant to him—not what he was
looking for at all. “Times have
changed,” he thought. “It would

a lot of satisfaction in seeing Terry
and Steve in the same part of the
world, since they are both the off-
spring of Milton Caniff. Perhaps
they’ll get together out there to talk
about Dad.

Cuba seems to be relatively un-
popular these days although Smilin’
Jack has been tangled up with com-
munist types in an_ unspecified
Central American area.

The comic strips have no-one in
the other major trouble _ spot,
Africa, except for their permanent
delegate, The Phantom, who lives in
the deep wood with the dreaded
pigmy poison people, a horse, a dog,
and, occasionally, some nut of a girl
who seems to arrive for the big
weekends. The Phantom’s Africa
is clearly nowhere near the Congo,
and the Phantom does not seem to
have heard of Major Generals Vic-
tor Lundula and Joseph Mobutu.
When the pigmy poison people rise
and slay the “Ghosts who walks,”
then we will assurdedly know that
Africa has sunk into barbarism.

On the other hand, we have char-
acters notorious for their inability
to face up to the exigencies of mod-
ern life. Chief among them is Phil-
lip Finn for whom times seems to
have stopped in the early nineteen-
twenties. Others live in our modern
world of status seeking and preco-
cious young female novelists. Orphan
Annie and her friends seem to have
single-handedly licked a gang of
commie spies, American traitors and
teamster goons, so I have a sugges-

 

tion to offer. Why not send the whole

gang of them to Africa?

Finn would discover for the first
time that there was something be-
yond his lace curtain world, and
Mary Worth could really get her
teeth into a contemporary prob-
lem (colonialism with overtones of
prejudice, etc.), and Little Orphan
Annie would finally see a lizard leap.
But the most important advantage
would be that we would let the
emerging African nations know that
they are as important in our most
widely popular art form an any
Chinese or Cuban.

Of course, if we're to have a
wholesale incursion of the comic
strips into foreign parts, we’d have
to revise some policies: George
Wunder (Terry and the Pirates)
would have to learn to draw real
Chinese characters, for instance; but
most important, the big syndicates
could assign a political columnist to
each major strip. Then we'd have
such things as Steve Canyon, by
Milt Caniff and Joseph Alsop; Wal-
ter Lipman could be assigned to
Mary Worth and Marquise Childs to
Donald Duck.

But to effectively co-ordinate the
whole venture some government as-
sistance would be necessary. Since
Edward Murrow has his hands full
with the comical efforts of the US.
Information Agency, and since for-
eign policy decisions would have to
be made, the job would best be done
by the State Department. Perhaps an
under-Secretary for Funny Papers
could be appointed, and I have a
candidate: G. Mennen Williams.

 

Each year they come, turning the
rolling green lawn into a madhouse
of crinoline, perfume, glaring bright
dresses and wide blinking eyes.

They are the SIPA girls.

They talk about fraternity houses,
and drunks and parties and “all that
stuff, you know.” And once in a
while they go to seminars on how
to make advertising dollars count
and take yearbook pictures.

Washington and Lee sophomores
chase them, and talk to them about
drinking beer and going into base-
ments, and making out when the
lights go out in the second floor
apartment.

And the dogs that usually sleep in
front of Newcomb Hall stay away
for the weekend.

“We're here to have a party,”
chimed Ruth Clark, Melinda Cole-
man and Esther Johnson from little
ole Junis H. Rose High School in
Greenville, Nawth Calina.

“I’ve heard Washington and Lee
has 500 boys,” said pretty little Me-
linda, whose intent obviously doesn’t
center around yearbook makeup
lore.

And what does pretty, blue-eyed
Maria Deviney of East Mecklenburg
High School down around Char-
lotte, N. C., think about the frater-
nity party facet of SIPA?

“Shot... charge!” That’s all?

“T’ve heard some of the boys get
kind of high,” said pert Sandy Bill-
ups from Manchester High School in
Richmond.

But Maria Deviney doesn’t mind
“as long as they aren’t vulgar.”

And if she’s invited to a fraternity
house—“Oh, gosh, I won't go in
alone.”

Then into this world of parties and
wild “college boys” looms the Ad-
viser like a slamming door. It can
be a shattering experience for the
SIPA girls.

Mary Taylor from E. C. Glass
High School in Lynchburg was be-
moaning her dilemma. It seems that
her adviser was going to drive the
girls home after the last “academic”

SIPA Girls Discover W&L
Is A “Blast-Shot-Charge’ ’

session Friday and the girls would
miss the dance Friday night.

“Why don’t you tell your adviser
it’s dangerous to drive at night.
You know something like—the life
you save may be your own,” advised
a W&L onlooker.

“That’s why our adviser told us
we couldn’t stay here at night.”

“All my adviser said was to stay
out of fraternities,’ sighed Sally
Hamner from Culpeper High School
up the Valley a bit. Does Sally’s ad-
viser know about apartments?

And the girls from George Wash-
ington High School in Danville—
Mary Oakley, Robin Link, Kitty
Evans and Ellen Temple—described
their adviser as “half and _ half.”
All right, so what else is new.

And one adviser volunteered some
information of her own about her
girls. “This is the cream of the crop.
I wouldn’t bring any other kind.”
This led an onlooker to make a fun-
ny remark about harvests.

And amidst all the wide-eyed en-
thusiasm for the unknown the SIPA
girls have their own little problems.

Sally Hamer left her true rock ’n’
roll love back home in Culpeper.

“Sally told David she came up here
strictly for journalistic reasons, but
David knows Sally,” warned her
fellow SIPA girlmate. But then,
“Sally’s only been going with David
since September.”

And _ cute-as-she-can-be Sandy
Billups came up with a lad by the
name of Gary, who is spending his
weekend bagging groceries in the
A&P in Richmond while his sweet-
heart romps about Lexington. But
the prom is next weekend, noted
Sandy. So Gary can make up for
his lost time.

Some of the random comments of
this sea of young womanhood makes
about as much sense as the SIPA
Handbook’s seminar on “The Selec-
tion and Implementation of the
Theme.” But then does SIPA really
make any sense to the SIPA girls?

Allen Sees
Girls’ Schools
As Good Source

By HARVEY ALLEN

One great change I’ve notice
around the Hill with respect to
so-called Ring-tum Phi columnists
is that they seemingly are completely
avoiding the wealth of material with
which to fill their weekly columns...
namely the neighboring riding aca-
demies. I fail to see why, although
I'd be the last not to acknowledge
the necessity of poking fun at some
strictly W&L antics.

Speaking of neighboring riding
academies, we had the fortune one
day just before the first semester
exams to visit the two located in
the Greater Lynchburg-Amherst
area. Rather than a social routine,
we were in the midst of a quest for
knowledge, seeing as how a term
paper was due the next day. We'd
already trouped the stacks at Hol-
lins and were moving to new pas-
tures.

For some reason still unknown
to me, we found that the stacks at
*Macon’s library are not open to
“outsiders.” The large matronly-
type woman which greeted us with
a scowl pointed out that the facili-
ties other than the reading rooms
were only for the riding academy’s
students. Why, we wondered? Was
there some sordid incident involving
a male member of a nearby institu-
tion for higher learning? Could it
be that somebody at ’Macon once
saw Blackboard Jungle and figured
what happened in a lab classroom
could happen in the stacks?

Meanwhile, at Sweet Briar, we
noticed only one semi-earthshaking
change. A certain telephone pole had
been relocated, into which we had
come in direct contact on a
rainy afternoon back in September
1957.

We found the telephone pole had
been moved behind a tree. The orig-
inal, I might add had been com-
pletely sheared off that September
afternoon. Possibly this was to make
future action between the car and
the telephone pole more difficult or
maybe even to prevent members of
the Chesapeake and Potomac Tele-
phone Co. from milling around the
campus with any frequency. But
then smashing into telephone poles
hasn’t been an “in” game around
here since my freshman year.

Our last bit comes from the last
of the “Big Four,” riding academy-
wise, Baldwin. We were advised no
less than last Sunday night that
now, at last, the aforementioned
academy is well-known at such di-
verse places as Williams, Harvard,
and Princeton... W&L of the North-
land. As we are told, this new
awareness on the part of our broth-
ers to the north came about mainly
through the efforts of six "Baldwin
young ladies.

As a result we were further ad-
vised that the six, plus others, are
now planning overnights for next
year so as to take advantage of
the numerous invitations they ex-
pect from that area.

Baseball Team Downs George Washington 5-4

W&L Now 4-1
In SC Action

By HARRY MEEM

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team got four runs in the first in-
ning Saturday and then hung on to
win their third contest in a row, to
beat George Washington 5-4.

Senior righthander Roy Carpenter
won his fourth straight game.
W&L started fast, after holding

GW scoreless in their half of the
first. Buck Rose walked, Chuck
Lane laid down a perfect bunt and
beat it out for a single, Ned Hobbs
walked to fill the sacks, and Bobby
Williams singled to right to drive in
Rose and Lane. Hobbs moved to
third and Williams to second on the
throw from right field.

Carpenter then hit a sacrifice fly
to left, scoring Hobbs. Jim Russ
drew a walk, Robin Wood drew
another, and Park Gilmore hit a
sacrifice to center to score Williams
with the fourth run of the inning.
Howard Martin, the ninth batter
for the Generals in the inning lined
out.

W&L’s fifth run was scored in *

the third inning, when, with one
out, Carpenter walked, Russ
singled, Wood singled to drive
Carpenter home.

GW came back to score in the
sixth on three singles put back-to-
back with two out, and then scored
three in the seventh. The leadoff
man walked. Carpenter got the next
two batters out, but a walk and a
single scored the first run of the
inning. Then Robin Wood dropped
a fly ball to permit another run to
score, and a single accounted for
the last of GW’s runs.

The Generals, in avenging last
year’s 19-5 defeat, ran their sea-
son’s record to 6-4. This was the
third straight win for them, and
gives them a record of four wins
against no defeats on Smith field
this year.

The win for Carpenter gives him
four in a row, against two losses on
the Generals’ spring trip. Since his
loss to North Carolina State on April

Golfers Play
In Va. Tourney

The Washington and Lee golf
team left early Monday morning for
the annual Virginia State Intercol-
legiate Golf tournament at the Cas-
cades Course in Hot Springs, Vir-
ginia. The tournament boasts of en-
tries from twelve Virginia colleges.
The schools represented are Norfolk
William and Mary, Richmond, RPI,
Virginia, Hampden-Sydney, Rand-
dolph-Macon, VPI, Bridgewater and
Lynchburg. The tournament is a
medal affair with 6 men playing.
The best 4 scores are taken for ag-
gregate medal—36_ holes.

The tournament, which started in
1950, has seen Washington and Lee
bring home honors in 5 of its 11
years. In 1950 and 1951 W&L took
both team and individual awards.

Generals Win
5-4 In Tennis

The Washington and Lee tennis
team won over the opposing Roa-
noke College team this past week-
end in what seemed to be a very
close match for the Generals. Al-
though Roanoke College was a little
stronger than expected, Washington
and Lee won the match by the
score of 5-4, consisting of four singles
and one doubles. Washington and
Lee dropped the number one singles
match as John Baker was defeated
by Al Jacobs, an excellent player
from Philadelphia. They also lost
the number five position as John
Mills was defeated by his opponent,
Howell.

Excellent ability was shown in
the number three doubles match as
John Mills and Bud Hollman, a
freshman, also won his singles match
in the number six position and
seems to show great promise for the
Washington and Lee team.

A powerful Johns Hopkins squad
scored practically at will as it rolled
over the W&L lacrosse team for its
seventh win in as many collegiate
starts. The final score was 17-2.

The Blue Jays poured in four
goals in the first period and six
in the second to run up a 10-1
halftime lead. They added two
goals in the third period and five
in the fourth to close out the day.

Roy Mayne, Jerry Schmidt, Henry
Ciccarone, Pat Mahoney, and Dick
Webster were the big guns for the
Blue Jays, while Hunter Tracht and
Charlie Gummey were the standouts
for Washington and Lee.

Mayne scored five goals and had

goals and had one assist, and Webs-
ter contributed ten assists. Hunter
Tracht and Charlie Gummey were
the only scorers for the Generals.
Tracht scored W&L’s first goal after
Johns Hopkins had scored six times.
Gummey got the Generals’ other
goal at the end of the third period.
making the score 12-2.

Jerry Schmidt made the out-
standing play of the day when he
intercepted a Washington and Lee
pass on the W&L side of midfield
and went all the way, scoring
against Herb Tinley on a one-on-
one situation.

Johns Hopkins was penalized 15
yards to six for Washington and Lee.
In the goal tending department
Greenwood had 11 and Buchner had
two for Johns Hopkins, while Tin-

Eichmann Trial Has Not Been
Expected Propaganda Exhibit

By ED NORTON

The trial of Adolph Eichmann in
Jerusalem moves into its third week
today. Few trials in the history of
law have aroused so many issues—
both legal and moral—as the trial of
this man accused of murdering six
million Jews. During the proceed-
ings of the past two weeks, however,
several of these questions seem to
have moved from the realm of doubt
and can now be evaluated more
clearly.

One of the first issues raised was
that of the legality of the trial—
whether or not Israel has the right
to try Eichmann. This was the first
question raised by Eichmann’s at-
torney, Robert Servetius. The wealth
of evidence, the citing of numerous
legal precedents (i.e., the United
States Supreme Court ruling that} Many broader issues are underly-
war criminals may be punished by! ing the Eichmann case. What the

tion or the state of Israel with at-
tempting to stage a drama for prop-
aganda purposes. The undeniable but
ugly truth of the story Hausner
told simply destroys this accusation.

The purpose of the Eichmann trial
as far as the state of Israel is con-
cerned now becomes more clear. It
is not for propaganda purposes that
Eichmann is standing trial; neither
is it an attempt to reopen old
wounds. Prime Minister David Benn
Gurion stated very precisely Israel’s
position. “It is not out of revenge
that the Israel government placed
Eichmann on trial before a Jewish
court in the state of Israel. We, the
sovereign Jewish people in Israel,
are seeking atonement for the blood
of six million Jews who were killed
because they were Jews.”

Propaganda Show?

A second questionable aspect of
the Eichmann trial was whether or
not the proceeding would become
merely a propaganda or show trial.
Last week, Hausner read a minutely
detailed document outlining what
the Jews call “the Nazi Holocaust.”
It required the better part of two
days to deliver and even then was
incomplete. The atmosphere in the
court room during these two days
could hardly have been undramatic
and uncharged with emotion. But
one hardly can accuse the prosecu-

the Generals did all right against a
team as powerful and as versatile
as Hopkins. The Generals took
twenty-one shots, and were con-
sistently hitting most of them
right in the goal-scoring area.

Johns Hopkins has two more
games left, while the Generals have
two also. The Blue Jays will play
Navy, last year’s national cham-
pions, on May 13 and will vie against
Maryland a week later. The Generals
will complete the season on May 6

we'll go.”

On drunks: “You’re gonna find
them everywhere (with a resigning
sigh)... Let them stay away from
me (apparently determined).”

On where they’re staying: “Robert
E. Lee... Mayflower...Green Val-
ley...”And a puzzled “at some old
lady’s house.”

On why they came: “What???...
for a little of both—parties and
learning something... to support Mo
Shumate, our candidate for presi-
dent” (obviously a lucky lad). A
shameless, “Seariously? Or for fun?
Which would you all perefer?” And
a final truism, “I came to get new
ideas.” Yea, on yearbooks.

6. If the statement was made, it
was the individuals concerned who
were voicing their personal opinions
without the sanction of the Commit-
tee. To make such a statement would
be direct codification of the Honor
System—a policy from which the
Committee has refrained in the past.

Camp, though work done at Summer
Camp clearly affects one’s status as a
student at W&L. On what authority
was this done, with what reasons,

and why was it not publicized?

I think it is clear that the Con-
stitution has been violated by cer-
tain members of the EC. Those mem-
bers should be held to account for
their actions.
