UCA Coaches Local Boys
In Football, Other Sports

Many W&L students who are mem-
bers of the UCA Boys Clubs have
helped this fall in bringing football
on a competitive basis to the boys in
Lexington’s elementary schools.

About a month ago, the boys, all
fourth, fifth, and sixth graders, were
divided up into eight-man teams which
practiced one afternoon a week, and
played on Saturdays. Equipment was
supplied from a $100 budget of the
UCA which was supplemented by Dick
Miller and the W&L Athletic Depart-
ment.

The highlight of the season was a
Thanksgiving Bowl Game held on the
Friday before vacation. The winners
of the day are to be rewarded with
a trip into Cave Spring under the
direction of Nick Denton, head of
the W&L Spelunkers. Directly after
the game a pair of shoulder pads were
awarded to the most improved player
as determined by the UCA men who
had coached.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, NOVEMBER 29, 1960

By STEVE HENRY

The 20th century literary man is
set apart from the writers of other
ages because he lives in a constantly
changing world where nothing can be
presupposed, John Ciardi told a
duPont Auditorium audience last night.

Ciardi, poet and professor at Rut-
gers University, opened an extended
Glasgow-sponsored literary sympos-
ium, speaking on “The Last Time I
Saw Wordsworth.”

Mr. Ciardi will speak again tonight
in duPont Auditorium at 8:15 p.m.
The title of his talk is “The Next
Time I See Confusion.” The talk to-
night will continue the goal he set
in last night’s talk, pointing out some
of the preconceptions of nineteenth
century poetry and showing how they
are not applicable to the confusion of
20th century life.

Every day we meet confusions
which never once occurred to
Wordsworth,” said Ciardi. “Words-
worth never worried about Freud,
about Darwin, and now such prob-
lems of life are sure to arise.”

 

“Wordsworth didn’t have to ask the
number of questions which any serious
writer asks today,” said Ciardi. “He
didn’t have to contend with Freud,
Darwin or any of the others.”

“No one today is going to write
like Wordsworth. There is nothing
predetermined, and the poet must
choose his own forms to settle a gen-
eral dislocation which grips the artist.”

Ciardi said that the poet must
deal with two major audiences, the
vertical audience and the horizon-
tal audience.

“Everyone alive is part of the hori-
zontal audience,” said Ciardi, “but the
vertical audience is neither all alive
nor all dead.”

“The masses make up the horizontal
audience; they have no reason to be-
long to the vertical audience. Their
role is to give the best-sellers a short,
happy life.”

“The vertical audience, however,
is in touch with the art of all times.
It sees the continuity of all things,
and, assuming the art is good, the

| doesn’t make sense, are you going to

 

estimation of the vertical audience |

Commerce Fraternity To Initiate New
Foreign Student Exchange Program

The Commerce Fraternity is spon-
soring the International Association of
Students in Economics and Commer-
cial Sciences program at Washington
and Lee. The program is now under
consideration by a steering committee
under the direction of Billy McWil-
liams and Andy McThenia.

The members of the committee in-
clude Huntley Biggs, Carter Fox, Mike
Masinter, Bill Moore and Fred Walk-
er. The faculty advisors are Dr. John
Gunn and Dr. Leland McCloud. At
present this committee is working on
locating jobs in the United States for
foreign students. The number of jobs
that the committee finds will determ-
ine the number of Washington and
Lee students that will be able to enter
the plan.

The final decisions concerning
students entering the plan will be

made on the local level by a com-
mittee of faculty and students. The
most qualified will be chosen ac-
cording to their past record in all
phases of campus activity. While a
firm knowledge of the language of
the country one wishes to attend is
stressed, it is not a requirement.

The students accepted into the pro-
gram can work from six weeks to three
months in the European programs. In
general, their salaries will allow them
to break even during the period they
are employed. They will be required to
pay for their transportation, however
this will be at reduced rates since
AIESEC is chartering a plane to Paris.

The Commerce Fraternity commit-
tee will begin to offer and process ap-
plations in January. It will then sub-
mit it’s decisions to the international

 

convention, and receive word con-

 

cerning those students chosen by
March.

Andy McThenia, a co-chairman of
the committee participated in this
program last summer. He worked in
Germany on a plan that closely re-
sembled a junior executive training
program.

In addition, the steering commit-
tee also asks any students who may
have knowledge of possible jobs for
foreign exchange students to please
get in touch with one of its mem-
bers.

In recognition of the growing in-
terest in international business oper-
tions various universities in the
United States have been supporting
a new type of foreign exchange train-
ing program. This program called

By ROY GOODWIN

Friday Assistant Managing Editor

Joseph L. Arnold, a 1937 graduate
of Washington and Lee, has_ been
nominated by W&L for the 1960
Sports Illustrated Silver Anniversary
All-American Team, it was announced
today.

An attorney, real estate developer,
and sportsman of both Lexington and
Versailles, Ky., Arnold received his
LL.B. degree from W&L in 1987.
While a student he was one of W&L’s
finest halfbacks, and in 1935 led the
W&L team to the Southern Confer-
ence Championship.

 

Moot Court Team Loses
In Wake Forest Tourney

On Saturday, Nov. 19, the Moot
Court Team of Washington and Lee’s
Law School narrowly missed a chance
to go to New York to participate in
the national finals. The team lost out
in the second round of the Moot Court
regional debates at Wake Forest Col-
lege in Winston-Salem, N. C.

The W&L team got off to a good start
by defeating the team from the Uni-
evrsity of Virginia in the first round.
In the second round, however, the
team was edged out by South Caro-
lina. As two teams go to the nationals,
this win for South Carolina, in addi-
tion to a bye that they drew in the
third round assured their going to
the nationals.

The team from W&L that went to
Wake Forest consisted of seven
members of the Law School: John
Morrison, Bob Gilliam, Tom Bryant,
Bob Shepherd, Gerald Smallwood,
and two alternates; Joe Spivey and
Ray Robrecht.

The case this year involved a vio-
lation of the National Labor Relations
Act. The National Labor Relations
Board alleged an unfair labor prac-
tice against an insurance company in
that they refused to bargain in good
faith with the union certified to rep-
resent their employees as required by
the Labor Relations Act. The W&L
team had prepared their brief to rep-
resent the insurance company.

Up For SI Silver All-Stars

A release from Sports Ilustrated
says that nomineees’ names with the
citations by the various universities,
have been submitted to the board of
judges which will pick 25 finalists
for the award in December.

The Silver Anniversary All-Ameri-

can awards are based on distinguished
living during the twenty-five years

intervening since college football, the
release said.

“The essential idea of the awards,
that athletics and education are joined
in ‘the pursuit of rounded human

Deferred Rush Takes Twenty-Six
PiKA, Sigma Chi Pledge Majority

By HAL McCLANAHAN

According to the latest IFC rec-
ords, 27 of those 76 freshmen who did
not pledge a fraternity during rush
week have accepted bids from nine of
W&L’s 18 fraternities.

This year’s deferred pledge repre-
sents a 5 per cent increase in com-
parison to the freshmen who pledged
during deferred rush last year. Last
year 19 of 59 non-fraternity fresh-
men, 32 per cent, pledged after the
formal rush while 27 of this year’s 76
non-fraternity men, or 37 per cent,
have pledged. In comparison to the
number of boys pledging during de-
ferred rush over the past years, the
number of deferred pledges this year
is a little high, since roughly a third
of the boys who did not pledge dur-
ing rush week have been taken by
fraternities heretofore.

IFC President Dave Lefkowitz
had the following to say in regard
to this year’s deferred rush pledg-
ing: “I am quite pleased with re-
sults of this year’s deferred rush.
I am glad that the fraternities have
been so successful with their defer-
red rush pledging.”

At the present moment Sigma Chi
leads the other eight fraternities, who
who have taken new members in de-
ferred rush, with a total of eight
freshmen. The PiKA house is second
with five. These additional pledges
bolster the houses’ pledge classes to
16 and 12 respectively. DU has taken
three freshmen in deferred rush. The
following houses have each added two

freshmen to their pledge classes: Beta,
SPE, Phi Kap, Kappa Alpha, and
Kappa Sigma. Pi Phi and Lambda
Chi have each pledged one new mem-
ber.

Listed below are the names of the
houses and their new pledges: Beta
Theta Pi, Steve Parl and Steve Daven-
port; Delta Upsilon, John Wiggs, Ed
Bundell, and Bill Van Dyke; Kappa
Alpha, Andy Hyde and Bruce Lawton;
Kappa Sigma, Jim Sylvester and Bob
Brewer; Lambda Chi Alpha, Mel
Mitchell; Phi Kappa Sigma, George
Spalding and Chuck Shumate; Pi
Kappa Alpha, Ken Kowalski, Charles
Urquhart, Jim Turner, Dick Lesly,
and Dick Goode; Pi Kappa Phi, Jim
Horton; Sigma Chi, Dick Holiday,
Sandy Ross, Bob Moye, Jim Hardin,
Mark Gee, Jim French, Pete Stelling,
and Craig Blackstock; and Sigma Phi
Epsilon, Steve Colvin and Dick Sager.

| Since rush week seven fraternities
| have depledged 12 of their pledges.
|The following is a list of the seven
houses and the freshmen they have
depledged: Lambda Chi Alpha, Dennis
Morgan; Sigma Nu, Buddy Kroger,

Bill Van Dyke and Noel Bright; Sig-
ma Chi, Jim Dunlap and Sam Rayder
| and Phi Kappa Sigma, Austin Bray.
Bruce Lawton, Bob Brewer, Jim Syl-
vester, and Bill Van Dyke have since
pledged other houses.

 

 

| There are presently 57 non-fraternity
members of the freshman class,

 

deavor in which they have excelled.”
Sixty-seven colleges and universi-
ties across the country have studied
their senior football players of the
year 1935, and entered their choices
in the roster for the award. The men
selected for the award will have ex-
celled in sports, public service, and
business, according to the release.

Arnold entered W&L in 1932 and
was the first football player ever to
wear the “00” number which Wash-
ington and Lee traditionally re-
served for players of exceptional
promise and ability.

Over a three-year career, the re-
lease added, Arnold distinguished him-
self as one of the finest halfbacks in
W&L football history. He received
All-State, All-Conference, and honor-
able mention All-American honors
while a student.

Following his graduation, he joined
Allen, Botts, & Duncan, a Lexington
law firm. In two years, Arnold be-
came a member of the firm.

In World War II, he served with
the US Government as a member of
the counter-intelligence corps, and
served in Okinawa and in Korea.

Since 1946, he has entered the
construction business, the coal busi-
ness, and the real estate business.

The president of Fayette Enterprises,
Ine., which is developing a subdivision
in Lexington, he is also president of
the Lexington Aircraft Sales, Inc., a
corporation designed to sell airplanes
and render charter services.

Arnold achieved national notice on
the country’s sports pages as the pres-
ident of Turfland Corporation, a firm
which buys, sells, and breeds thorough-
bred horses. The first horse acquired
by Turfland was Bally Ache, pur-
chased for the price of $1,259,000.

Arnold was the only nominee from
Kentucky in the race for the award.

tained in the Registrar’s Office after

will prove more valid every time
than the estimation of the horizon-
tal audience.”

The poet must make his works ver-
tical, according to Ciardi.

“He must find the human position
in relation to the position of the world
around him and create. The hori-
zontal audience may not want reality,
but the vertical audience does. The
poet isn’t concerned with the pretty,
but instead with the real.”

Ciardi called poetry the “continu-
ing experience of the race, and not
a mere advertisement.”

“People who ask why poetry doesn’t
make sense ruin all decent conver-
sation about the subject,” he com-
mented.

Ciardi asked members of the au-
dience to recall the last vivid dream
each had experienced.

“Just because that dream probably

say that it took a Communist homo-
sexual writing on the left bank of the
Seine to devise the plot?”

“The rhythm of our age is com-

plex,” Ciardi said. “It is the ryhthm
of the Jazz musician, of the mechan-
ic, of static; and our lives are the
same way.”

“There is no way to set anything as
a standard today. The setting up of a
tradition only leads to the breaking
of that tradition.” a

Life, according to Ciardi, is a series
of patterns familiar to the mind, and
stagnant patterns lead to what the
sociologist call a “cultural lag.”

“The poet sees the new, the anti-
established which breaks away from
the patterns, and he must find new
forms to settle his own needs, even if
it means abandoning some of his own
audience.”

The Glasgow Endowment Com-
mittee-sponsored literary sympos-
ium, entitled “The American Writer
and His Public,” will continue
through Dec. 9.

Danzansky Spends Holidays
On 1961 SWMSFC Musical;
New Production Taking Shape

By BOB BRIDEWELL

The 1961 SWMSFC Musical is
rapidly progressing from an idea to
a reality. The first act of the play,
based on an old Greek comedy by
Aristophanes, was completed during
the Thanksgiving holidays, and casting
for the 47 available parts in the pro-
duction has been scheduled for the
week before the Christmas vacation.

Steve Danzansky, producer and di-
rector of the musical, which is still
unnamed as of this date, was pleased
at the progress made in “integrating
the many parts of this production to
create a finished work.” He said, “For
months we peck out ideas and pro-
gress slowly, if at all, but as time
goes on the musical seems to pick up
speed as we weave the script, score,
and other details together. New ideas
come quickly, and the finished pro-
duct gradually takes shape.”

Danzansky has been working with
Dr. Ross Borden on the script of
the spring musical.

Last year’s SWMSFC Musical, “The
Cannon’s Mouth,” also produced and
directed by Danzansky, played for
five performances to a capacity crowd
of over one thousand. Over one
hundred people were involved in the
production of “The Cannon’s Mouth,”
making it the largest extra-curricular
activity on the Washington and Lee
campus. This year’s production prom-
ises to involve even more personnel,
as Danzansky has increased the cast
alone from last year’s 35 to an esti-
mated 47 parts for the 1961 Musical.

The casting will be open to the en-
tire student body, with 25 male roles
to be filled. Girls from Sweet Briar
will compete for the 22 female parts
written into the musical. Danzansky
added, “I plan to hold tryouts in
about two weeks so that voice ranges
of the members of our cast will be
known to the arrangers. Professor
Stewart, who did the arranging last
year, is unable to do so this year, so
we've turned to professional sources.
Under consideration at the present
time are several prominent arrangers
in Washington, D.C. We have also
contacted a man who arranged for
Rodgers and Hammerstein on Broad-
way and is now retired.”

Most of the members of the orches-
tra for the Musical have been selected.
Danzansky has tried to produce a
smooth sound by using more strings
and less brass in this year’s group. He
also mentioned the possibility of using
Sweet Briar girls in the orchestra.

Many of the people who worked on
last year’s executive staff are returning
this year. Some positions are still
open, however, and these will be posted

 

 

 

 

 

NOTICE

There will be a Commerce Fra-
ternity beer party at 8 p.m. on
Thursday, Dec. 1, at the Zeta Beta
Tau House. All members and pro-
fessors from the commerce, eco-
nomics and political science depart-
ments are cordially invited to at-
tend.

There will be a meeting of the
Forensic Union at 7:15 in the For-
ensic Union room of the Student
Union tonight,

 

on the ODK board in the next few
days. Danzansky expressed an opti-
mistic outlook concerning student en-
thusiasm in the musical. He added,
“Much of the legwork this year will
be handled by two assistant directors,
Tim Morton and Ronnie Alenstein,
both of whom worked in last year’s
musical. A year’s experience has done
wonders for us all. As this year’s
production evolves, I find myself dis-
satisfied with things that I accepted
last year. I am quite pleased with
what we have done so far, and I feel
that this show will be quite an im-
provement over “The Cannon’s
Mouth.”

Editorially Speaking

Overload?

There is no doubt that an honor system may be overloaded
by too many written rules and regulations which deal with the
more trivial aspects of school life. It might be argued that honor
is a relative term and that whether a certain action is, or is not, a
breach of the honor code could be decided by the contemporary
student generation. Our Student Body Handbook states that
such is the case.

If we accept this idea of an honor system that changes with
the generations, as we suppose we must, the next question that
comes to mind is, “what would happen if the present student
generation were to decide that it was no longer a breach of the
honor code to fail to report a suspected honor violation?” The
obvious answer would be that the failure to report a violation
makes up, along with lying, cheating and stealing, the four
cardinal sins against the honor system and that the above viola-
tions are more specific and relatively less troublesome to pin
down.

There has been an alarming tendency among the student of
late to talk of individual honor as a thing that can be pressed
only so far and which, when stretched, or imposed upon, ceases
to be bound by principles of honor and good conduct. There
have been many complaints that the honor system here is be-
coming overloaded, and that certain organizations within the
University Community have misused the honor system in that
they have, through the Executive Committee of the Student
Body, had certain actions declared to be honor violations in
order to cut down on the number of personnel required to
protect their profits. They forget that one of the beauties of
having an honor system is that we do not need a gestapo force
to watch over our every move.

The Dance Board has been the target of much criticism.
There seem to be many students who feel that dance plans
should be transferable. They have, therefore, attacked both
the Dance Board and the EC for declaring that the transfer of
a dance plan is a breach of the honor code.

We ask those who believe that the action of the EC has over-
loaded the honor system to consider these two points:

1) All those who buy a dance plan place their signature be-
low the following statement: “I understand that admission to all
the dance sets is personal and non-transferable.”

2) To transfer a dance plan is to cheat the Dance Board out
of the price of a door admission, which is much more than the
purchaser of the plan has to pay per dance set.

 

It seems to us that any person who had signed the above
statement and then deliberately gave his plan to another stu-
dent would be guilty of an honor violation whether or not the
EC made any previous ruling on the matter. The University and
all the organizations and persons within it should be able to trust
the members of its community to uphold any contract or pledge
which they have signed.

It must also be remembered that the Dance Board has to
work on a projected budget. Door sales make up approximately
one tenth of this budget. Without the money gained from
these sales, The Board would not be able to contract the type
of entertainment to which the W&L dance goers have become
accustomed.

Therefore, when a student transfers his dance plan, he, in
effect, cheats the Dance Board out of a sale and the money from
that sale. It might be argued that one dance plan was bought
and that only one was being used; hence no one lost money.
This argument is seen to be faulty when we recall that admission
at the door is much more expensive per dance set than the price
per set that is paid by the holder of a dance plan.

We maintain, therefore, that the transfer of a dance plan
is and should be considered a breach of the honor system, and
that those who feel that it should not be so considered ought
either to ask that the Dance Board withdraw the statement con-
cerning the non-transferability of the plan from the front of
the plan, or in the event this request is denied, (as we feel that
it should be) cease to purchase the plans and pay the door
prices which are by no means unreasonable.

Send Us A Letter

The Tuesday Edition of the Ring-tum Phi would like to
encourage the students and faculty of Washington and Lee to
write letters to the editor. The letters should be brief and to
the point. We reserve the right to edit these letters as circum-
stances may require.

There are many controversies which arise throughout the
year that affect both the students and faculty. If you have an
opinion, why not make it public? Your ideas may well influence
the decisions that are made by the various representative bodies
around the school.

 

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

During this time in our lives we
make decisions which will effect our
entire future. The most important one
of all concerns our future profession.
With so many prospective doctors,
lawyers, salesmen and so forth around,
some perfectly fascinating careers are
completely ignored by young college
men. Of the many splendid opportuni-
ties open to young collge men, one
of the most splendid is police work.
Perhaps some of you .are unfamiliar
with the intimate details of this pro-
fession, or are only cognizant of such
aspects as are revealed (albeit in a
warped manner) in the various televi-
sion programs which function as elec-
tronic romans policiers. For you un-
fortunates I can happily recommend
a study of an ordinary American Police
Force, our own Lexington Constabu-
lary.

These clear-eyed, alert, smartly
uniformed officers will serve more
than adequately as examples for my
subject: Police Work as a Life-Time

 

Career. Whether clad in mufti or
in their crisp brown uniforms, Lex-
ington’s police seem to have a per-
manent air of dependability and
forcefulness about them. Even when
performing the onerous task of writ-
ing out a summons (they prefer,
usually, just to give warning, since
they feel that the proper function
of the law is prevention, not pun-
ishment), they do so with a snap and
decision that would do credit to an
Army general. And they do their
writing with an ease which one
would not expect from those who
have not had the advantages of a
grade school education.

But enough about their salutory ef-
fect on the law-abiding citizen. What
is the reaction of the would-be law-
breaker who may inadvertently stray
into the confines of our fair city? Let
the facts speak for themselves. What
would your reaction be if you came
skulking into town to case the Rock-
bridge National with an eye to heist-
ing the priceless photomural of Natur-

 

al Bridge and you came upon, as you
would say in your thieves’ cant, the
local fuzz? There he would stand on
main street, cigar in mouth and hands
in pockets, authority practically drip-
ping out of every pore. Or perhaps you
would come upon him as he was
handing out parking tickets in the
lot behind the movie, or perhaps you
would see him as he was beating up
some student for resisting arrest. You
would come to respect that gleam of
intelligence in his eye and slink off
to tell your accomplices that Lexington
looked too tough.

The casual visitor to Lexington
does not, however, see the police
force doing the painstaking, back-
breaking, detailed work which rarely
pays off but which is so necessary.
A perfect example of this dedicated
sort of work is found in last year’s
license changeover day. Promptly
after midnight of the last day, the
police descended on all parked cars
bearing the wrong license plate
and gave them tickets. There are

This year we have had much cause
to take a long look at the Universi-
ty’s academic regulations. With an in-
creasing emphasis on academic ex-
cellence, it is only natural that we
view the controls and methods for
achieving that excellence in closer
perspective.

One area with which we are par-
ticularly concerned is that of the
grade-point ratio. While our parents
may still be quite baffled about its
internal workings, most of us have
managed to figure it out, and accept
it. However, it is within this marking
system that there is great room for
change, in order to make it conform
with other University policies.

As all of us have happily or un-
happily noticed, there is no pro-
vision within the marking system
that will register a student’s exact
level of achievement. We now ac-
cept the fact that, in general, a B
grade is given for work between
the 83-92 level; an A is given in
the 93-100 area, and so on. The par-
ticular ranges vary with different
professors, but in each case, it is

Bleary and bushed we returned to
classes yesterday morning following
the four-day Thanksgiving holiday.
Our condition was not due to any long-
distance traveling, for we spent the
vacation in the Lexington area. The
situation arose more from how we
spent the time rather than where we
spent it.

First, we stocked up on the essentials
which provide for a good date week-
end: food and liquor. We could not
decide which offended us most, fight-
ing the Lexington ladies in the local
markets, or trying to get to the counter
of the liquor store on Wednesday after-
noon. Nevertheless, we accomplished
both tasks, being of a stubborn nature,
and we dare say that the results were
much worth the efforts.

Secondly, we drove out to one of
the nearby “Riding Academies,”
and we appropriated one of the
rider. We must comment at this
point that we enjoyed the hours pro-
vided for by these institutions dur-
ing such times as Thanksgiving hol-
idays. There were none.

Following the return trip to Lex-
ington, we commenced our vacation
properly speaking, that is, the relax-
ation which is (or should be) under-
stood by the term “holiday.”

We were pleasantly surprised to
see that many other students had
chosen a plan similar to ours. We kept
running into other couples, the one
individual a W&L student, and the
other a lady rider from one of the
academies, In fact, we could venture to
say that this Thanksgiving holiday

 

saw more students in the Lexington
area than in years of the near past.

 

 

quite obvious that there is a large
range from one grade level to the
next,

As a result, very often a student
will become lazy when he feels fairly
certain he has little or no chance of
achieving a grade in the next higher
range. While one can never question
the value of personal satisfaction, there
seems to be little more that this in-
volved when one receives an 81-C,
or a 92-B. This type of grade does
very little for incentive, and often
goes a long way towards destroying
it.

We cannot question the University’s
reason for maintaining this present
policy, but we can find methods that
might improve upon this policy. We
feel that it is most important to of-
fer incentive to those students who
desire it, and, at the same time, to
give them recognition for it.

Possibly one method to change
the present system would be to put
the marking system on a five point
schedule. Under this system, a stu-
dent would receive a five for a
grade of A. This grade would still

cover the same grade average as

Vacation In Lexington Described
As Enjoyable And Not Lonely

All this goes to show that Lexing-
ton has the potential to enjoyment
even in long periods of academic un-
activity. Perhaps a cabin in the coun-
try, an attractive date, a good supply
of food and liquor, and the pleasant
weather aid in the make-up of a fine
holiday, but nevertheless we must in-
sist that anyone can enjoy himself
even in Lexington, and even during
a Thanksgiving vacation.

We must note, however, that we
were displeased to find the Student
Union and other university buildings,
excepting the Library, tightly secured
for the duration, We thought this an
unnecessary measure of security. One
could have found himself quite em-
barrassed had one invited people over
for a visit, and had he only been able
to point to the exterior of his uni-
versity, providing approximately the
same treatment any tourist with no
affiliations here whatsoever finds.

When we returned to classes on
Monday morning, in the condition we
mentioned earlier, we discovered that
the faculty had been dreaming up
all sorts of projects for the next three
weeks prior to the long break at
Christmas. Such as a concentration of
quizzes and term papers so soon after
a vacation, during which we found
so much delight, can only lead us
to believe one of two alternatives.
Either professors despise vacation
periods, or they find themselves eating
too much during the holidays and
vent their digestive derangements on
the students.

Be it as it may, there are three
short weeks to Christmas vacation;
we beg the help of God to reach
the date and extend a hearty “good
luck” to the rest of the student body.

Grade System Revision Urged

the present three point credit.

Added to this would be a four
point credit for a grade of B-plus.
This particular grade could be given
to those students whose average falls
into the upper third of the B grade
range. At the same time, a three point
credit would be given to those stu-
dents whose average lies within the
rest of the B range.

The same type of policy could be
applied to the C range of grades. At
this level, a C-plus average could
be given a two point credit, and a
C average, the normal one point credit.
The grades below this would then
be given the usual zero and minus
one credits, for D’s and E’s and F’s
respectively.

Graduate Work
Could Be Asked

In News Career

By ED WEBSTER

Years ago, a man clenching a high
school diploma could go into an of-
fice and come out with a_ respect-
able job. He had all the education
he needed. Today, for almost any
white-collar, air-conditioned, swivel-
chair job, a bachelor’s degree is con-
sidered essential.

The coming trend, now that col-
leges are giving out bachelor’s degrees
by the thousands, is for young pro-
fessional men to have masters degrees.

And, if we may project this trend
into the future, a Ph.D., may some-
day become a prerequisite for these
same positions.

This demand for educated men (or
rather, for degree-bearing people) is
especially noticeable in the newspaper
profession. Metropolitan newspapers
now expect their reporters to be able
to interpret the news—to be able to
record today’s news as it will appear in
history books a decade hence.

While this trend is admirable, it will
have interesting side-effects. Consider,
for instance, the following scene in
a newsroom, about 1975:

The city editor, Josiah Keats,
Ph.D., L.L.D., L.HLD., LittD., is
receiving a phone call. He scribbles
something on a legal pad, then stands
and addresses the news room:

 

“There’s been a double murder and
suicide on East Murphy Street. Who
in here has a sociology degree?”

A slight, pallid girl raises her hand.
“I did my thesis in criminology,” she
volunteers.

“Excellent. Take the photographer,
Dr. Snelch, with you. Try to find out
the murderer’s motivations. Check
his life history. See if he had any
complexes. Get pictures of the en-
vironment — neighborhood, peer
group, et cetera.”

The girl and the photographer walk
leisurely out, pausing now and then to
glance at titles on the floor-to-floor

ceiling bookcases that surround the .

newsroom.

A copy boy enters, bearing a sack
of mail, “You know, sir,” he says to
the city editor, “people are still send-
ing us mail addressed to the Morning
Globe.”

“Idiots!” snorts Dr. Keats. “It was
two years ago that we changed our
name to The Politico-Sociological Re-
view.

“Human beings can be rather try-
ing at times,” says the boy.

 

Hoogenboom Praises Local Police;
Suggests Lawman Career Possibilities

other examples, too numerous to
mention, which describe the Lexing-
ton Policeman’s single-minded de-
votion to his duty.

But mere words cannot do justice,
cannot adequately praise, cannot ex-
press enough gratitude to the Men in
Brown. I can only recommend that
the student some day take time off to
witness this splendid scene: The jack-
booted officer, with a bold careless
grin pokes a cigar in his mouth, ad-
justs his vizor, leaps onto his growl-
ing motor scooter and roars off into the
night on his never-ceasing round of
law-enforcement. No more fitting
words could be used to praise them
than the Jukes family motto: “They
saw their duty and they done it.”

For Holidays

Scene 1. (A_ typical American,
upper-middle-class family is gathered
around the table for what appears to
be a rather special dinner. The father
of the family is carving on a large
turkey and the mother is gingerly
serving a red material We can
hear her saying, “I just can’t under-
stand why my cranberry sauce didn’t
jell ...”)

Enter son and heir, betweeded and
apparently hungover.

FATHER: Well, hello. How was
the party last night? You and Sandra
have a good time?

SON: Not quite. I got shot down by
her for some turkey. (Father, puzzled,
looks at bird in front of him.) I
couldn’t believe it. If it hadn’t been
for a batch of new sounds that Al
had over there, it would have been a
loser.

LITTLE SISTER: (who has a crush
on Al): Who'd Al have a date with?

SON (annoyed): Nobody, he crash-
ed and burned in the afternoon.

LITTLE SISTER (obviously dis-
tressed): Golly, that’s terrible. I hope
he didn’t hurt his new Impala too
much.

SON (coolly): Naw, just a little dent
in his fender skirts. Unfortunately, his
mud flaps were ruined.

MOTHER (still looking sadly at
the cranberry sauce): I didn’t think it
was fashionable to have mud flaps on
your car these days.

SON: Well, Al doesn’t think so any
longer.

FATHER (changing the subject):
Tell us how things are going at school?

SON (glowing with pride): Much
better. I got rid of that dog and don’t
think I’m flagging the Silver Fox any
longer.

FATHER (impressed): And are you
pulling those grades up now?

SON: Yes, sir. No more D’s and F’s.

(Mother leaves table to bring in
the tipsy cake, her prize dish.)

MOTHER (ladling on brandy sauce):
Ummm.

SON( clutching his abdomen): Will
you all excuse me a minute, please?
(He rushes to the bathroom.)

MOTHER: Certainly, Son.

FATHER (chugging leftover sauce):
I don’t think we need to wait on
him. END SCENE 1.

SCENE 2. (The next night at dinner.
The family eats in silence. It is ob-
vious there has been some bitterness
between brother and sister earlier in
the day. Brother smiles cruelly as
sister rushes out to answer phone.)

SCENE 3. (Two nights later at din-
ner. The family eats in silence. It is
obvious there has been some bitter-
ness between mother and son earlier
in the day.)

SCENE 4. (The meal begins in sil-
ence. It is obvious there has been
some bitterness between father and
son earlier in the day.)

SON (tenderly): Golly, I can hardly
believe the vacation’s over. But I’ve
got to get on back to school.

MOTHER: Yes, it’s a shame. But
we're glad to have gotten to see you.

Fauber, Kowalski To Lead Cagers Against Bridgewater College

Sophomores Give Best Support

On Young, Inexperienced Team

Washington and Lee’s youthful basketball squad opens its
1960-61 season Dec. 1 at Bridgewater College, and if things
turn out as indicated, W&L fans will be talking about the foot-
ball team’s success until early March.

The Generals, playing their third year under Coach Bob
McHenry, face an 18-game schedule with little experience,
even less height, and a questionable scoring punch.

Only two lettermen return from last season’s squad
which won 7 and lost 10, and which lost its first four
scorers via graduation. Unless McHenry discovers a
new sharpshooter, he’ll depend largely on his veterans,
6-2 Rodger Fauber and 6-0 Ken Kowalski, to assume the
point making burden.

Both boys are sophomores and both work most effectively
as corner men, although Kowalski can shift to the backcourt
with ease. Fauber played regularly last year until sidelined by
an illness, and he averaged 8.8 points and 9.1 rebounds a
game. Kowalski was a top reserve until Fauber’s loss, when
he became a regular and wound up with a scoring mark of 5.8
per game.

McHenry hopes each boy will score more by shooting more.
Fauber displayed 48.2 accuracy from the floor last year,
Kowalski hit on 42.1 per cent of his field goal attempts.

 

while Coach Bob McHenry discusses an important play with the top five o
Fauber, Bill Ide, Ken Kowalski, and Brett Thackston.

The Coaches Corner

McHenry Counts
On ‘Go Attack’

Here it is the end of November and
another basketball season is upon us.
The football team and coaches made
all of us proud to be associated with
Washington and Lee. We hope that we,
too, can continue in their footsteps. It
certainly will be no easy task.

What is in store for the 1960-61
Generals’ opponents? We have a young
team that will make up in hustle what
it lacks in experience. The squad will
consist of one senior, three juniors,
nine sophomores, and a_ freshman.
These boys have been going at it for
six long weeks and are anxiously
awaiting their first opponent, the Lit-
tle Eight Champion of last year,
Bridgewater. The Eagles have three
of last year’s starters back from the
team that beat us twice, including
Jim Reedy, a 27 point per game scorer,
who is being pushed for Little All-
American.

After we play Bridgewater on
Thursday, we come home to cozy
Doremus to host Norfolk William and
Mary on Saturday. They too have

(Continued on page 4)

 

 

There is another letterman available in guard John
Kirk, a regular on McHenry’s first 1-15 team in 1958-
59, but scoring isn’t Kirk’s strong suit. He averaged only
2.4 a game as a starter. Even so, McHenry will look to
the 6-1 senior to provide some measure of maturity to
the starting five.

The Generals’ other starters are likely to be 5-9 sophomore
Brett Thackston in the backcourt and 6-6 freshman John Mc-
Dowell at center. Thackston saw some action with the varsity
last year, but he hardly rates as an experienced hand. He’ll be
the playmaker. McDowell is 6-6, the first of such size McHenry
has had as a college coach, and that’s enough to spell
S-T-A-R-T-E-R all across his practice jersey.

Top reserves are 6-3 Steve Rutledge, 6-4 John Culley,
6-1 Dave Grogan, and 6-0 Dave Beale.

Rutledge may move into a starting forward role early in
the season. A dislocated finger has handicapped him in pre-
season practice, but he rebounds well and has a deft jump
shot. Culley was the regular pivot man on the 1959-60 frosh
team, and Grogan was top freshman scorer. Beale uses his
pivot foot better than any player Coach McHenry has ever
seen.

McHenry says he expects to run when he can, but
he’ll rely primarily on patterns off a single pivot. “We'll
work for the percentage shots on offense and hustle like
mad on defense,” he summed up.

 

The Generals play nine games at home, and if they can

Matmen Tackle North Carolina In Friday Opener

By STEVE GUILD

The Washington and Lee wrestling |

team will meet its first opponent, the
University of North Carolina, this
Friday at Chapel Hill, N. C.

The team, while it has good depth
this year and could easily fill any
place left vacant by injuries, is com-
posed mostly of juniors and sopho-
mores, and the team’s weakness will
probably lie in this. Both star wrest-
lers Danny Dyer and Drew Danko left
last year. Dyer was the team’s
strength in the 137 lb. class, while
Danko was the team utility man, serv-
ing in practically any position he was
needed. Coach Dick Miller commented
that “with these two men on the
team last year, we could be assured
of two pins right off and that goes
a long way in winning a match.”

Even though the team is younger
this year, Miller feels no uneasiness
in placing what he calls the “two

best freshman prospects I have this

with the expectation that they will
fill any of the vacant spots that
might appear. Ed Jensen from Bal-
timore, Md., and Herb Smith, a
Newport News boy, will probably
see action in the 137-157 classes,
although their definite positions
have not been decided yet. Dick
Albert, a sophomore from Tulsa,
Okla., seems to the Coach to be “the
upcoming utility man of the team.”

In the heavyweight position on this
year’s squad are Graham Fulton who
is the starter, backed up by Sam

Bloch, another sophomore, Miller
feels that this is probably the strong-
est position on the team right now and
hopes that they can make up for any
defecencies in some of the other slots.
At the other end of the roster is
Dave Montgomery in the 123 Ib. po- |
sition who equaled the team’s record
last year with a 7-2 tally.

Three sophomores who will not
start or be on the team the first few
weeks but are counted on to bolster
the squad in the coming season are
Bob Pagano, Tom Clements, and Jud
Babcock, who all have been out for
fall sports and have not had any spe-

 

cific wrestling practice yet.

Captain and senior Sandy Mer-
sereau is expected to bring pins
again this year as he did last sea-
son in the 147 Ib. class. Kent Frazier,
who will not be in the first several
meeis because of his upcoming
Rhodes Scholarship tests, should be
in line sometime before Christmas
in one of the heavier weight classes.

The schedule for the matmen this
year is about the same as last year’s
except for a few changes. The Gener-

Galef Criticizes Grading System |

(Continued from page 2)

The University’s academic require-
ments could then be scaled accord-
cording to this particular system.
This system might tend to raise the
overall average of the University,
since there is no provision for credits
that would result in the B and C
minus levels. However, since the
University at present does not pen-
alize a student for having an aver-
age that might be lower than his
report card grade might appear,
there is little need to do it in the
future.

In any case, the purpose of this
particular change is to provide in-
centive for work accomplished, and
not to offer further discouragement.
This should certainly be the purpose
of an institution devoted to both ex-
cellence and individual attention.

Perhaps this system would not be
the most feasible one for the Univer-
sity to follow. However, there might
be a method that would come closer
to equating a student’s record of
achievement with his report card
average. Some schools accomplish
this by using the method outlined
above. Others keep a factual record
of a student’s numerical average at

points a game last year. Included in
their starting five are Bill McCraw,
who stands 6’ 7” and Bob Newton at
6’ 6”. Norfolk W&M is predicted to
replace Bridgewater as the top Little
Eight team in Virginia.

Our work is cut out for us in our
first week of competition, but we
think we are ready. I hope that many
of you will come out and root for

In any case, these plans accom-

Good Depth

(Continued from page 3)

 

Dec. 16, in a home meet, and North|
Carolina State has been added in
place of Wake Forest, who dropped
their wrestling program entirely last |
year.

Coach Miller thinks that the team’s
two hardest matches will be with
Franklin and Marshall, which they
take on in an away meet on Dec. 10,
and West Virginia University, another
away meet for the Generals on Feb.
16, 1961. These two schools have al-
ways caused considerable trouble for
the Blue and White, and this year
should be no exception, especially since
both are not home matches. The one
bright spot in the Franklin and Mar-
shall picture, however, is that the Dip-
lomats lost four of their best starters
from last year, and this should give
the W&L men an advantage.

As far as the rest of the schedule
is concerned, Miller isn’t making any
predictions. He learned last year that
this isn’t always the best thing to
do. He thought, as the rest of the
team did, that New York University
would be one of the tough ones on
the schedule. As it turned out the
Generals beat them by a sizeable
year.

Dad, I’m sorry about your car. But
I get mine out of the shop Monday,
and I can send Mom’s back next
Sunday with Sandra. She can drive
now that they’ve found someone that
will insure her.

DAD: That’s wonderful. Well, bye.

(All embrace. Exit son. Little sister
begins turning the charm on father.
bitterness fades.)

CURTAIN.

of operations in this country with the
outlook for expansion to the Washing-
