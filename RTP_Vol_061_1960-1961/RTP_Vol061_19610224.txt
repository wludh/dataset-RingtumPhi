Former Visiting Professor, ae
Toynbee, Speaks March 10 |

By GEORGE HONTS
Managing Editor
Famed British historian Dr. Arnold
Toynbee will speak on “Does History
Make Sense?” in Doremus Gymna-
sium at 8 p.m. Friday, March 10.

Dr. Toynbee will be the guest
of a personal friend and collabora-
tor, Dr. E. D. Myers. His lecture
is sponsored by the University Com-
mittee on Lectures headed by Amer-
ican History professor Dr. Allen
Moger.

Students and townspeople are in-
vited to hear Dr. Toynbee’s address.

Here in 1958

The university and Dr. Toynbee
should run into fewer difficulties
than in 1958 when Dr. Toynbee was
a ‘visiting scholar in residence’ for
the spring semester.

In a series of 15 lectures at that
time, Dr. Toynbee lectured on “A
Changing World in the Light of
History.” He concentrated on World
trouble spots, especially in Asia, and
concluded the series by saying the
world’s sole hope for salvation lies
in higher religion, and not in na-
tionalistic idealogies.

All 15 of the 1958 lectures were
filmed by Encyclopedia Britiannica
Films. The lectures were held in
Lee Chapel, which was too small
to seat the crowds which usually
numbered at least 800 and was un-
suitable for filming. After covering
over holes which might cause echoes
on the sound track, the producer
found Dr. Toynbee couldn’t see the
stop and go lights on the cameras.
The producer was able to solve that
problem by waving a Confederate
flag from the rear of the Chapel
balcony whenever he wanted Dr.
Toynbee to start or stop.

Closed-Circuit TV

The overflow crowds wanted to
squeeze into 550-capacity Lee Chap-
el. But the overflow was finally tak-
en care of by rigging a closed-cir-
cuit TV to a vacant room in McCor-
mick Library where ticket-holders
could watch Dr. Toynbee speak.

At the beginning of the lecture
series, the university conferred a
doctor of humane letters degree on
Dr. Toynbee. The degree was pre-
sented by Dr. Francis P. Gaines.

A native of London, Dr. Toynbee
is 71 years old. In 1955 he retired
as director of studies at the Royal
Institute of International Affairs, and
as research professor of internation-

 

Spring iusloal
Program Set

This Spring, several groups of mu-
sicians will present programs on and
around the W&L campus.

On Sunday morning, March 5th,
the John A. Graham Brass Choir
will present a short liturgical concert
in the Lexington Presbyterian
Church. The choir’s first selection
will be the “Sonata for Brass” by
Pezel. The other work in the pro-
gram will be a “Canzona for Organ
and Brass Choir” by Gabrieli.

On March 19th the W&L Glee
Club will combine with the Long-
wood College Choir and a nineteen
piece orchestra to present portions
of Handel’s “The Messiah” and
Faure’s “Requiem.” This concert
will be held at 4:30 p.m. in the Lex-
ington Presbyterian Church.

The glee Club’s annual Spring
concert will be held on April 26 at
8 p.m. in Lee Chapel. The West-
hampton College Glee Club will be
the featured guests on the program.
Each group will present the out-
standing songs from its repertoire.

On March 13th the W&L Concert
Guild will present pianist George
Feyer. Though Mr. Feyer has been
brought up in the classical tradition,
he now plays in the caberet style.
Feyer’s presentation of popular mel-
odies in an unaffectedly simple, yet
refined manner has won him acclaim
on the continent in Paris, Monte-
Carlo and St. Moritz. His concert
will add something new to the con-
cert series.

On May Ist at 8 p.m., the Concert
Guild will present the Lywen String
Trio which is composed of the fore-
most string players in the National
Symphony orchestra of Washington,
D.C. The concert will be in duPont
Auditorium. Included in the pro-
gram are works by Beethoven and
Mozart and by Fine Arts Professor,

 

Robert Stewart. The concert will be
the premiere of Dr. Stewarts’ “Try-!
pitch.”

The Washington and Lee faculty
has recently approved a change in
curriculum for all freshman and
sophomore military science students,
which will become effective next
September.

The move was made in response
to a new educational policy adopted
by the U.S. Army last December
which now allows individual col-
leges and universities to be more
flexible than formerly in adopting
military science courses to meet the
individual needs of each institution.

Specifically, this change will re-

Degrees Given Gov. Darden,
Dr. Cole By Union College

This morning at Union College in
Schenectady, N. Y., Dr. Fred C. Cole
President of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity and former Virginia Governor

and former president of U.Va. Colgate '

W. Darden, Jr., were recipients of
honorary Doctor of Law and Doctor
of Humane Letters degrees, respec-
tively.

Speaking on “The Future of the
South,” Governor Darden was one of
the principal recipients in a ceremony
marking the 166th anniversary of the
founding of the old Upstate New York
liberal arts and engineering college.
Dr. Cole spoke on the life of Robert

A. Toombs of the Class of 1828 at |

Union, who was the first secretary of
State of the Confederacy.

Dr. Cole Honored

The exercises at which the honor-
ary degrees were presented charac-
terized our president in the following
statement:

“Fred Carrington Cole, you are a
Southerner born and bred, since you
were born in Texas, received your
higher education at Louisiana State
and Tulane Universities before you
were called last year to the Presi-
dency of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity in Virginia. You are also a his-
torical scholar, having been a History
Professor, an editor of the Southern
Biography Series and of the Missis-
sippi Valley Historical Review, and
an authority on the history of the
American South. Union College, proud
of its long tradition of educating lead-
ers of both the ante-bellum and the
post-bellum South, is happy to wel-
come you to the fraternity of College
Presidents and to the society of our
honorary alumni by conferring upon
you the degree of Doctor of Laws.”

Gov. Darden’s Remarks

The year 1619, when the first Ne-
groes were introduced into the Eng-
lish North American colonies, marked

ton Hall 25.

 

“...the start of an unstable and un-
healthy regionalism which many years
later was to explode in the dreadful
and costly conflict of 1861,” former
Gov. Darden told the Founders Day
audience.

Pointing out that the early Negro
arrivals were not slaves but inden-
tured servants, Governor Darden said,
“The decision to substitute life servi-
tude for the contractual arrangement
whereby workers might enter the col-
onies as indentured servants and by
their industry and application earn a
place for themselves as freemen...
was costly beyond calculation both
morally and economically.”

“The most telling and probably the |
most far-reaching consequence of
forced labor was the creation of a
complete gulf between the agricultur-
al laborer and the landowner...
Slavery not only deprived the black
man of his freedom but it also de-
prived the enterprising self-reliant free
man and indentured worker of op-
portunities for employment and ad-
vancement. It generally closed the

 

door to the free labor force... which
is so necessary for the development

of any area and which would have
been of inestimable value to the South.
In the enlargment of forced labor we
find the germs of regionalism that was
impoverishing and divisive.”

1865 Marked End of Era

Also singled out for discussion by
Governor Darden was the year 1865,
which, he said, “...marked the end
of an era for the South. It was during
that year that the nation had its only
chance to avoid the fearful agony of
reconstruction...As it was, after a
start that seemed to promise much,
there was one difficulty after another
until the complete estrangement be-
tween President Johnson and his party
came about. The result of this was
military reconstruction for the South-
ern states and a long period of strife
and anguish which almost completely
paralyzed recovery.”

Cites Unifying Influences,
Current Progress

“Service together in World War I,”
Governor Darden said, “was the first
very great event tending to re-en-
gagement and understanding. But

Army Announces Selections

For Graduating ROTC Men

The Department of the Army has
released the branch assignments,
term of duty requirements and call
dates for a great portion of Washing-
ton and Lee seniors in the ROTC
program here.

Major Edward J. Roxbury, profes-
sor of Military Science and Tactics at
W&L, expressed his pleasure at the
number of assignments that corres-
pond to the __ students’ original
requests. Everyone who asked for
a delay in order to go to graduate
school received the delay of active
duty. Out of those cadets who asked
for a six month term of active duty,
77.2 per cent will receive this status.
Those cadets who requested a 2 year
term of service were granted that
form of enlistment.

Also, a number of students were
granted their original choice in a

nine tenths per cent of the students
who have received their assignments
were granted their first choice, while
18.8 per cent received their second
choice. Each cadet submitted three
branches in his order of preference
to the Department of the Army and
for the most part where possible,
these requests were honored.

It is interesting to note that per-
centage wise those students who re-
quested a 2 year term of active duty
received a greater number of their
first choices, whereas, those men who
requested a delay received a lesser
amount of their original requests.

ly taught in the freshman year to
the sophomore year and one now
taught in the sophomore year to the
freshman year. Most significant is
the fact that an entirely new course
will be added to the freshman year.

Beginning in September 1961, the
American Military History course
now taught freshmen will be part of
the sophomore year of study, and the
National Security course now taught
in the sophomore year will be part
of the freshman curriculum.

General Military History

The new course for next year’s
freshmen will be called “Great Cap-
tains in Western Military History,”
and will deal with general military
history of Europe, from the time
of Alexander the Great to Napoleon.

In addition, freshmen will be re-
quired to buy a regular commercial
textbook for the course, whereas
normally ROTC students have their
textbooks furnished them in the form
of ROTC manuals on specific sub-
jects and sub-courses. This is so
because this course will be unique
at W&L.

The text for the new military his-
tory course will be Decisive Battles
in World History, by J. F. C. Fuller.

 

Applications from students interest-
ed in filling the vacancy on the As-
similation Committee are being re-
ceived by the secretary of the Stu-
dent Body, Billy McWilliams, at the
Phi Delta Theta House until Feb. 27.

Don Partington, chairman of the
committee, also announced today that

the Commons is being moved to the

Plans are also being made to relo-
cate the assimilation box in duPont
Hall, he said.

The chairman and other members
of the committee have expressed con-
cern with the failure of the student
body to uphold the speaking tradi-
tion. Although the committee has not
fined in cases of violation of the
speaking tradition, Partington says the
committee must take action if the tra-
dition is not upheld.

Students are reminded that tennis
shoes are not considered conventional
dress, and Partington urges students
to adhere to the conventional dress re-
quirement more closely.

The Assimilation Committee will
hold its fourth meeting of the semes-
ter Tuesday evening at 7 in the Stu-
dent Union. All members are urged to
attend.

1. Coats and ties must be worn at
all times.

2. Freshmen going to and from the
gym are not required to wear conven-
tional dress.

3. Freshmen going to the Co-Op
are not required to wear conventional
dress after 9:00 p.m.

4. Students riding in cars are not
required to be in conventional dress.

5. Socks are considered as part of
conventional dress and tennis shoes
and Blue Jeans are not.

6. Freshmen are required to use the
walks on the campus and may not
walk on the grass.

7. Students should adhere to the
tradition to speaking on campus.

 

Dr. Louis Hodges To Lead

Religious Discussions

Beginning this week studies on
Christian ethics for college life will
be held weekly under the leadership
of Dr. Louis W. Hodges, Assistant
Professor of Religion, The discussions
are divided among two groups, with
the Freshmen meeting on Wednesday
nights at 10 o’clock in the Freshman
Reading Room and the upperclass-
men on Thursday nights at 7 o’clock
in the Student Union.

The text book for the discussions
will be Conscience on Campus by
Waldo Beach, one of the country’s
most popular campus speakers. Con-
cerning the book, Dr. Hodges stated
that it is “the best book I know of
on the subject of Christian ethics in
college.”

Senator To Discuss Education Bill

Pi Sigma Alpha
To Initiate
New Members

By EDWARD S. CROFT, II

Pi Sigma Alpha, the national hon-
orary political science fraternity, will
hold its initiation of new members
at 5:45 p.m. on Wednesday.

Following the initiation will be a
banquet for all members of the Beta
Omega chapter.

At 7:30 the fraternity will spon-
sor an address by Sen. Barry Gold-
water, Republican conservative
from Arizona.

Fourteen new members, whose
names have not yet been disclosed,
are to be admitted into the fraternity
next Wednesday. The chapter has
undergraduate juniors and seniors,
law students, and faculty members.
Warren Welch, Law School senior,
is president of the chapter and Dr.
A. E. Ragan is the faculty adviser.

Pi Sigma Alpha chooses its mem-
bers on scholastic achievement only,
and exists for the purpose of stimu-
lating interest in political science.
The members meet every other week
to discuss public affairs and politics,
and sponsor a speech at least once
a year by leading political figures.

Discuss Education

Sen. Goldwater will discuss the
elements of his new bill on educa-
tion which was submitted Monday
as a substitute for the Kennedy Ad-
ministration program.

The leader of the conservative
element in the Republican Party is
the author of a best seller, The Con-
science of a Conservative. He was
one of the outstanding figures at the
GOP National Convention this sum-
mer.

Tentative arrangements have the
senator scheduled to speak in Lee
Chapel. He is expected to arrive at
a near-by airport on Wednesday af-
ternoon .The public is invited.

One of the most articulate conser-
ative spokesmen of our time, Sena-
tor Goldwater has read widely in
the field of political theory from
Aristotle and Cicero to Jefferson,
Lincoln, Wilson, and Theodore
Roosevelt. His philosophy of govern-
ment as revealed in his best selling
book, The Conscience of a Conserva-
tive, is substantially as that expres-..
sed by President Jefferson in his
first inaugural address:

A wise and frugal government,
which shall restrain men from injur-
ing one another, shall leave them
otherwise free to regulate their own
pursuits of industry and improve-
ment, and shall not take from the
mouth of labor the bread it has earn-
ed: this is the sum of good govern-
ment and this is necessary to close
the circle of our felicities.

Native of Arizona

Born in Phoenix in 1909, and edu-
cated at Staunton Military Academy
and the University of Arizona, the
senator began his political career
some forty years later when he
was elected to the first two terms in
the Phoenix city council on a re-
form ticket. He led his seven-man
slate on balloting each time.

In 1950, he served as campaign
manager for Republican Howard
Pyle’s successful bid for the gover-
norship of Arizona. In 1952, he ran
against and defeated the Democratic
majority leader of the United States
Senate, Ernest McFarland.

Senatorial Duties

In the Senate, Goldwater is a mem-
ber of the following committees:
Public Labor and Welfare, Interior
and Insular Affairs, and the select
committee on Improper Activities in
Labor or Management Field. From
January 1955 until February 1956 he
was chairman of the Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee. He
was re-elected to this post in 1959
and again in 1961.

Senator Goldwater is active in a
variety of activities of a non-political
nature. He is a brigadier general in
the U.S. Air Force Reserve, an ex-
pert on Indian Matters, an associate
of the Royal Photographie Society of
London, and a devotee of Dixieland
music. He has explored every section
of the Grand Canyon, once discover-

 

ing an unknown natural bridge.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Conscience Of A Liberal

Melting snow, intermittent rains and “conservative” apol-
ogies have transformed this campus into a physical and intellec-
tual quagmire. Peaks were reached both on the barometer and
in the campus media on Tuesday of this week. Unfortunately,
we cannot, at the present, control such extremes in the weather,
but we hope to check this intellectual drift.

Norman Thomas and Graham Morison may have been too
much for our apologists to digest in one sitting, but the
cliches these indignants offer in rebuttal smack of prejudice, pro-
vincialism and political confusion. They shroud the doctrine
they have fabricated with the blanket-term, conservatism, and
settle down again, blissfully and contented, amid the once-
rippled mud that is Virginia.

In a breath , they warn against liberal “‘messiahs”’ filtering
through the state, at the same time assuming affinity with the
self-appointed conservative prophet, Barry Goldwater.

Our concern is not with the many and varying practical
ramifications of conservative and liberal “isms,” but with the
spirit behind which each is fostered. The oligarchic, Tory con-
trol of the notorious Byrd machine is a far cry from the creed
advanced by Goldwater which denies centralized political en-
roachment on the rights of the individual. Our apologists fail
to recognize this dichotomy of conservative terminology— or
any of the many other conflicts—however, as they combine the
traditional and the existant with complacency, conformity and
satisfaction and term it “conservatism.” The spirit which
Thomas Jefferson (whom these apologists claim by virtue of his
opposition to federal dominance was an arch-conservative) fost-
ered his political credos was a liberal spirit. We need only to
cite the following in support of this tenet: “We hold these
truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal. And
that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable
rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness.”

The spirit of liberalism is liberty. It is the mood which ac-
cepts new innovations and welcomes wholesome change. It
is not chained to the dogma of the past, but is at liberty to im-
prove upon the present. Its considerations are far-reaching and
often are, from a practical standpoint, impossible, but its al-
legiance to the progress of man is more than emotional in im-
pact—as is evident in the 200 year history of the United States.
We are living in an unfamiliar and changing world, but we shall
never emerge from it safely if we cling cravenly to old formulas
or attempt to hide behind medieval prejudices.

This is the spirit our generation must cherish. If the past
was the only answer, we would all be pilgrims. The cancers of
conformity and complacency lurk in the potholes of our society,
and must be exposed to assure the continuity of this freedom-
loving spirit of liberalism.

New Buildings—A Definite Asset

Although one of the primary functions of any newspaper
is to level criticism where criticism is due, it must be remembered
that it is also a vital function of any publication to render praise
where praise is due.

The two announcements that were made during the past
few weeks concerning the construction of two new buildings on
the Washington and Lee campus both, we feel, warrant a great
deal of praise. We are, of course, referring to the statements
that work is to begin in the very near future on the construction
of an addition to Howe Hall, a new science building, and on a
new dormitory that will be used to house freshmen.

It has been our general policy to praise the “New Era” for
its far-reaching decisions. These decisions, we feel, have been
characteristic of this University over the last few years. For
this reason, we once again praise the administration for its an-
nouncements that work is about to start on these long-awaited
and over-due facilities.

It has been a known fact that for a long period of time

the present science facilities have been inadequate, as have

RES IPSA LOQUITUR

 

By THORNS CRAVEN
Friday Columnist

Going over some of the past issues
of the Ring-tum Phi it is hard not
to notice the
trend toward first
person interviews
of individualists.
Each _ columnist
seems to think
that he has found
the last one of an
almost extinct
race, and hastens
to put his impres-
sions of the repre-
sentative of that
rare species into
good New Yorker Profile form.
Rising to the challenge I have joined
the hunt, and I too have found one
of the last of the individualists.
Hereafter I will be referred to as
we, and the he referred to will be
half of we. The other half will be
I, except when more than two people
are involved, and in that case you
will have to do the math for your-
self.

Donning our (that’s my to you)
safari hats (actually there was only
one) the other day (actually last
week) we (me) went in search of
an individualist. But before em-
barking we decided to stop at one
of the local taverns for some sup-
plies for the trip, and much to our

 

Craven

 

surprise the hunt ended right there.

What do you think we ran into
before we could finish even half of
our large draft beer served in
small glasses (you realize of
course, that when I am we I have
to have two glasses of beer, one
for each of us)?

You could never imagine our sur-
prise when we bumped into an in-
dividual sitting at our very booth.
To use John Paul’s phrase, I did
(oops, we did) indeed have some
initial misgivings when we first
noticed the individual characteristics
of the individualist sitting across
from us, but they were quickly dis-
pelled as soon as he bought us a
beer.

Before proceeding further we
suppose that it might be a good idea
to identify, and give a little bio-
graphical information about our in-
terview. He is probably the most
authentic of the last of the indi-
vidualists because he is probably
the last individual you would think
of. Nonetheless, we can vouch for
the fact tht he is an individual. His
name is not Jose Jiminez, but Fred-
dy Walker, which rhymes with Jose
Jiminez (if Jose Jiminez is pro-
nounced incorrectly).

Naturally our conversation with

Freddy got around to his running
for Democratic Presidential nomi-

 

Judging from general student re-
action, last week’s ODK_ speaker

_-.. committed two
' sins, one mortal,
one venial. He

made what was
generally regarded
as a poor speech,
ie., either badger-
ing, boring’ or
bombastic then he
broke tradition
and challenged the
validity of Vir-
ginia’s conserva-
tism which he
closely identified with conformity.

Ironically, the speaker’s second
sin was generally regarded as the
more serious one. Mr. Morison gave
what was probably one of the most
blistering attacks upon Southern
conservatism which this school has
ever or will ever hear. This type of
speech could be expected to bring
some adverse reaction from an au-
dience predominantly conservative.
In fact, one or two students did walk
out on this affront to their idealogy.
But the rest remained, squirmed
and applauded cynically evidently
more sensitive about lunch and their
stomachs than about their political
beliefs.

As the Tuesday Edition has al-
ready pointed out, Mr. Morison’s
speech contained some exaggera-
tions, but it also contained some
pertinent wisdom. Mr. Morison
pointed out for example, that the
government of Virginia is essentially
a government by oligarchy. You may
call Mr. Byrd’s political machine
leadership or you may call it con-
formity, but the fact remains, as

Mr. Morison showed, that relatively
few Virginians participate in either

state or local elections, that state
elections seldom produce discussion
of deep issues, and that Virginia still
has a one-party press.

John Kenneth Galbraith has de-
fined those accepted ideas which
have great stability and are highly
predictable, and which are held to
long after they have lost their reason
for existence as the “conventional
wisdom.” In one sense Virginia may
be a victim of her conventional |
wisdom. If her leaders demand a
balanced budget in our complex na-
tional economy when a_ balanced
budget is often impossible and often
undesirable, if her leaders demand
less government activity in business
when the electrical trust case reit-
erates the necessity of government
supervision, then her leaders are
living in the past.

If, on the other hand, Virginia
leaders are able to follow their oe |
servative beliefs in running Vir-
ginia’s state government, that is
something else. It may very well be
that Virginia’s economy is still a
predominantely agrarian one. If so
then low taxes, minimal government
and frugality are possible and desir-
able. As Virginia moves into a more
industrialized economy, however,
these beliefs may have to be dis-
carded or at least modified.

The conduct of a majority of the
student body at the ODK assembly
revealed a certain lack of good taste,
manners and tolerance. In any case,
Mr. Morison did point out some sali-
ent objections to the conventional

nation in 1960, and to his triumphal
entrance into the city of Lexing-
ton in a covered wagon. We were
asking Freddy of his associations
with former political greats, es-
pecially with Harry Truman, and
the question arose, “Freddy, did
you see Mr. Truman when he was
here?” With modesty which is so
characteristic of him Freddy re-
plied with a blush, “Ha, did Harry
Truman see me?” We agreed that
he probably did.

Since Freddy is a frequent spec-
tator at Washington and Lee athlet-
ic contests the conversation left the
realm of profound political theory,
and we began talking about sports.
With one of the epigrams for which
he is so famous Freddy said “It’s the
best in the west.” Later on he elabo-
rated on that statement by saying
that as far as geography was con-
cerned “It’s the least in the east.”

Taking a cue from other first per-
son interviews that should have
been in third person we started
talking to Freddy about books. Most
interesting were some of the com-
ments on books he hasn’t read. He
said that he really hasn’t decided
which book that he hasn’t read is his
favorite, but that he favors The
Metaphysical Foundations of Mod-
ern Physical Science by E. A. Burtt
over Col. Wise’s Philosophic History
of Civilization. This prejudice, he
admits, is based on the weight of the
respective volumes, and not the color
of their bindings.

After a few hours of talking to
Freddy we gave up taking notes, and
after several beers we gave up re-
ferring to ourselves as we. Unfortun-
ately this was not due to a lapse of
memory concerning editorial plural-
ity, but to a weak foundation in
grammar. We continually referred
to ourselves as us instead of we.
But the mistake has been corrected,
and we’re back on the side of right
thinking.

This digression seems to elim-
inate any more of the enlighten-
ing conservation that we had with
Mr .Walker, but that is because

Visit By Queen
Shows Regard

For Colonies

(Editor’s Note: This week’s art-
icle is a continuation from last
issue’s column.)

By JON B. McLIN
Friday Columnist

The current visit of the Queen to
Pakistan and India is typical of the
continuing vigilance which is main-
tained for Far Eastern affairs by
Great Britain.

At the same time, her visit serves
to exemplify the nature of the
British influence over its former col-
onies. This influence, in a day when
it is no longer of a military kind and
decreasingly of an economic nature,
is ideological. It is the ideals of de-
mocracy and social welfare common
to Britain and her former colonies
that their interests are united.

The success of this influence may
be judged from the fact that all
former British colonies except
Pakistan are now operating un-
der democratic constitutions, not
to mention the strong economic
and diplomatic ties which unite the
Commonwealth countries.

It is only by understanding the
ideological nature of this influence
that it can also be understood why
Britain enjoys advantages over the
U.S. in dealing with these areas
and, indeed, why she can exert an
influence that is forbidden to the
U.S. This is true because the U.S.
confronts three ideological problems
in these areas which bother Britain
to a smaller, if not negligible, de-
gree.

These three problems are the
prejudices against non-white races,
against socialism, and against neu-
tralism. Racial prejudice, while it
hasn’t completely been abolished
here, is certainly minimized, at least
if Oxford may suffice as an example.
This eliminates the problem in deal-
ing with African and Asian colonists
that the U.S. encounters because of
discrimination in the South and else-
where.

It is similar with socialism and
neutralism. Having committed itself
to a Welfare State, achieved without
loss of democracy, Britain is in a
position to advise newly indepen-
dent states which aspire to the same
ends. And, as for neutralism, while
Britain is definitely committed to
the Western alliance, she is not
hampered by memories of Dullesian
condemnation of neutralism.

It is because Britain has been
dealing with these problems for
some time with a high degree of suc-
cess, that the U.S. is often view-
ed from here as being naive in these
matters. Many Britons feel that this
is to be expected, as the U.S. has
only recently emerged from its for-
mer commitment to _ isolationism.
They nevertheless feel, not com-
pletely without justification, that the
U.S. should more frequently avail
itself of the advice of its more ex-
perienced ally.

The view that is held here of Pres-
ident Kennedy is an extremely en-
thusiastic one, largely because it
is felt that he brings to the Presi-
dency a more realistic view of co-
lonial questions. But this enthusiasm
is tempered with a note of caution
among the more sober souls. As the
Manchester Guardian recently edi-
torialized: “But if Mr. Kennedy has
not also learnt the lesson that even
a virtuous, democratic America can
no longer expect to impose its views
on other countries regardless of the
wishes of the local inhabitants or the

By JOHN CRITTENDEN

True or false? All good football players come to col-
lege to escape a life of poverty and coal-digging. They
arrive wearing dirty fingernails and a layer of anthra-
cite dust.

True, of course. Everyone knows that sound athletes,
even the shrewd quarterback types, come from humble
beginnings. Of poor but honest parents, as the political
biographies say. Those who do not live in coal-mining
towns are recruited from the Ozarks, and check in
wearing bib overalls with patched knees.

T’ain’t so, says Lee McLaughlin, football coach
at Washington and Lee, who gracefully accepted
a trophy as the state coach of the year from the
Portsmouth Sports Club Saturday evening.

McLaughlin will match his players against any in
the country, pound for pound—or dollar for dollar. Last
year’s undefeated team ranked just as high with Dun
and Bradstreet as it did with the football writers.

* * *

The players on this team registered at Lexington
wearing three-button tweed coats, ties with regiment-
al stripes and tab collars. They limp a bit, to the right,
after long years of carrying extra weight on the right,
or pocketbook, side.

before coming to W&L—schools like Kent, Hill,
Andover and Lawrenceville. The latter carries
an annual fee of $3,100. The others are priced
in the same neighborhood. To stretch a cliche, this
is a pretty expensive neighborhood.

These boys feel most at home in tuxedos. They own
their own cars. They talk about girls, fraternities and
other creature comforts, but they are conversant also
in the stock market and real estate values.

But the Generals bleed red blod, not blue.

You can’t tell them from coal miners whey they
put on football uniforms. They rip and snort and knock
people down.

Washington and Lee does not sanction football
scholarships. Only one starter gets help from the
school—he’s on an academic grant. “But just be-
cause these kids don’t need financial assistance,
don’t get the idea they don’t like it rough.”
says McLaughlin.

% * ca

The coach backs this up with a word about a Wash-
ington and Lee football tradition.

The school awards a blanket—with insignia proper-
ly inscribed—to the roughest player on the squad. “The
kids would rather win that blanket than be named the
most valuable player,” says McLaughlin. “It’s the most
sought-after award we have.”

McLaughlin is the quiet, easy sort, short on hair

 

ily himself. His father was a Presbyterian minister.
There were nine little McLaughlins and somehow all

nine went to college. Lee went on an athletic scholar-
ship.

Since football is a demanding business and
rough-and-tumble, even when the players are
not paid, McLaughlin must offer a criticism now
and then.

This would make the average coach a bit gun-shy.

After all, an irritated player might really get mad.
“Get off my ear,” the kid might say, “or my pater will
buy this college and get a new football coach. One who
isn’t quite so loud.”

The boys have plenty of pocket change.
One starting halfback is the son of a leading DuPont

chemist. “Mister DuPont” they call him around the
practice field.

The parents of another starter always take a
couple of days off to see their son play each week-
end. They commute from three states away.

* He a

The captain of the 1960 team arrived at the beginning
of the school year in a limousine complete with uni-
formed chauffer.

Recently there was a picture of a handsome Phila-
delphia home in National Geographic Magazine which
caused a small stir in the W&L locker room. Just a
small stir. Not much. Seems the place was owned by

be specific.
McLaughlin sees so much of this sort of thing that
he makes a mistaken assumption once in a while.

He thought Steve Suttle, a quarterback and a
Texan, was of wealthy parentage.

Suttle denied it. “Coach, my parents had to
make quite a sacrifice to send me,” Steve said.

“Shucks,” said McLaughlin, “I thought all Texans
were rich.”

It is a Washington and Lee standard that all stu-
dents wear coats and ties. Conventional dress, it is
called. Naturally, this applies when the Generals go
on the road. It causes trouble sometimes.

Washington and Lee was in Pittsburgh to play
Carnegie Tech last season. They happened to hit the
school dining hall when a group of art students, in-
cluding some genuine beatniks, were eating.

ae * *

One of the bearded types came by the Wash-
ington and Lee table carrying a tray, stopped
suddenly and mumbled “Hey, lookit. Who are all
these creeps in coats and ties?”

“Come on, creeps,” said McLaughlin, “Let's go.”

This is an injustice. Not even beatniks have a right
to be critical of these boys just because they weren’t
born in log cabins. Poverty is not a prerequisite to
accomplishment any more. Didn’t a member of the not-
so-idle rich, and a part-time touch football player at
that, just make it as president?

INTRASQUAD GAME TOMORROW

 

McLaughlin Finally Gets Team
With Experience; Outlook Good

“Experience is our ace in the hole.”

That was Coach Lee McLaughlin’s
confident remark as he watched his
Washington and Lee football squad
approach the end of two week’s
spring practice.

Until last year, the always smil-
ing McLaughlin had little to smile
about really, and after each of his
first three seasons at W&L his
perennial comment was:

“We need more experience.”

Last year Washington and Lee
rolled to its first undefeated season
in 46 years, posting an 8-0-1 record.

Now with 39 members members
of that crack squad returning, Mc-
Laughlin can sit back and smile
confidently when someone asks him
about his team’s experience.

Included in the 39 returnees are
eight starters and ten players off
W&L’s first alternate unit.

Spring practice ends tomorrow
with the annual intrasquad game at
3 p.m. on Wilson Field. Coach Mc-
Laughlin plans to make the oppos-
ing teams as equal as possible and
expects a good football battle.

McLaughlin’s potentially big prob-
lem—finding a replacement for Little
All-American center Terry Fohs—
may not materialize. At the end of

 

the 1960 season Fohs, a junior, said
that he would transfer to another
school in order to complete an en-
gineering degree. But now the 145-
pound center’s plans are indefinite.

Fohs has been working hard in
spring practice and is “looking bet-

ON THE BACKFIELD—“We'll have the same backs who started
in the last haif of the season—Steve Suttle, Doug Martin, Charlie
Gummey, and Jim Russ—again this fall. Freshmen McDaniel, Yoffe,

and Sackett should help us.”

ON EXPERIENCE—“Experience will be our ace in the hole.”

‘ANYWAY, WE BEAT THOSE ‘DAMN’ WAHOOS’

 

Cagers Drop Final 3, End With 7-11 Mark;
Streak In February Is Season’s Highlight

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Sports Editor

Last December when basketball
began it was said that come March
the students would still be talking
about the football team.

Well, March is almost here and the
football team is not the topic of con-
versation.

All the sports conversation is
about how a bunch of determined
W&L basketball players put out as
hard as they could and socked
our Big Brother to the North—
the University of Virginia—78-68.

Although the Generals lost their
last three games of the season, Coach
Bob McHenry still said happily:

“Anyway, we beat those ‘damn’
Wahoos.”

After a dismal start which saw
Generals capture only two wins in
their eight games before Christmas,
it certainly looked like the basket-
ball team was on a downward swing.

But after a heartbreaking 70-69
loss to the University of Chatta-
nooga in the first game after

 

Christmas, the Generals found
themselves and raced to five vic-
tories in their next six games.

Included in this span were upset
wins over Randolph-Macon (73-69)
and Virginia (78-68) and a 68-65
win over Lynchburg which ended
the Generals’ 15-game losing streak
on the road.

Those three big wins came within
a period of five days. In those games,
the Generals played basketball like
W&L basketball teams of old.

Against Randolph-Macon Bip
Fauber, Steve Rutledge, and Brett
Thackston paced a first half General
onslaught that produced a 43-28
cushion at intermission.

The Generals were determined
to win that one as they sank 17
of 34 shots from the floor the first
half—a cool 50.0 per cent.

In the second half, the Generals’
accuracy from the floor dropped to
24.1, but deadly foul shooting in-
sured the win.

Against Lynchburg, W&L trailed
the first half, but midway through

EGH Rips Generals, 68-59,
With Accurate Foul Shots

Washington and Lee’s basketball road jinx is still in full

affect!

The Generals ended their season Tuesday night at Emory
as they let an eight-point halftime lead vanish into a 68-59

Emory and Henry victory.

The loss was the Generals 17th
in 18 road games in the last two
years. Only a shaky 68-65 win over
Lynchburg two weeks ago kept the
two-record from being 0-18.

Led by Dave Grogan who hit five
of seven shots from the floor and
Bip Fauber, the Generals overcame
an early E&H lead and established
an eight-point halftime cushion.

Fauber tied the score at 2-2, 14-14,
and 16-16 with long jump shots from
the key before Steve Rutledge put
the Generals in front, 18-16, with a
driving layup with 10:20 left in the
first half

The Generals fought off the de-
termined Wasps until only 4:16 re-
mained in the game

At that point Tom Davidson sank
two free throws which made the
score, 57-57. Thirty seconds later
Larry Nave put E&H ahead to stay,
59-57, with two more free throws

On the ensuing play, the Wasps
stole the ball and went into a freeze

Responding just like the Wasps
planned for them to, the Generals
started fouling in an effort to get
the basketball.

E&H calmly sank eight more free
throws to put the game out of
reach.

Fauber paced the W&L scoring
with 16 points. Grogan and Brett
Thackston had 12 points each and
Bill Ide collected ten.

Fauber and Rutledge were one-
two in rebounding with 18 and 17,
respectively as W&L outrebound-
ed the Wasps, 62-53.

The Generals outshot Emory and
Henry from the floor as they hit

Thackston Leaves Puzzled ’Jacket To Rutledge

Thackston Rivals The Best Of Them On Court;
‘Brett’s Smart, Quick, And Alert-—McHenry

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Sports Editor
A month ago guard Brett Thacks-
ton made Washington and Lee coach
Bob McHenry a promise.
In W&L’s six games since then
Thackston has certainly lived up to
that promise.

The promise? It was short and
simple: “Coach, Tll never miss
another free throw in a crucial
spot.”

Thackston made this promise after

he missed a free throw that enabled |

the University of Chattanooga to
post a 70-69 victory over W&L
Jan, 7.

How has he lived up to his prom-
ise? The 5-9 playmaker has carried
Washington and Lee to key vic-
tories over Virginia, Randolph-
Macon, and Lynchburg with 80.9
per cent accuracy at the foul line.

Thackston, who leaves his nerves
on the bench when he enters a
game, sank 11 of 12 free throws in
W&L’s 78-68 upset of Virginia. His
two free throws with 6:20 left in
the game put W&L ahead to stay,

52-51. But the little guard wasn’t|

through. In the game’s last three
minutes he added eight more foul
shots to cement W&L’s win.

“Brett has been our quarterback.
I have not taken him out much
because the team doesn’t play well
when he’s on the bench,” McHenry
said.

Deadly accuracy at the free
throw line and a good jump shot
have made Thackston Washing-
ton and Lee’s leading scorer. In
fifteen games he has scored 223
points—a 14.46 average.

In the Randolph-Macon game,
the Yellow Jackets cut W&L’s
lead to one point with 4:03 left,
but Thackston stepped up to the
foul line, sank two free throws,
and kept the Generals on the
road to a 73-69 win.

At Lynchburg Thackston steadied
a shaky one-point W&L lead with
two free throws in the game’s last
fifteen seconds. W&L won, 68-65,
and broke a 15-game losing streak
on the road.

Thackston, a sophomore from
Bristol, Va., is W&L’s most im-
proved player. Last year he saw
only limited action, but this year
he has played more than anyone
on the team.

He turned in his best performance
against Virginia. The fiery playmak-

to show the Generals how to play
basketball.

Instead the Generals taught the
Wahoos a few lessons.

Led by Thackston and Fauber,
who collected 27 and 26 points,
respectively, their season highs,
the Generals slowly pushed their
lead upward.

The Generals did not falter under
pressure; they did not make mis-
takes; they went onto the court to
win. And win they did!

McHenry called the Generals’ per-
formance, “The greatest effort by any
team in any sport that I have ever
seen. They were simply great.”

The Generals’ final record (7-11)
is not too impressive, but with every-
one returning next year, the basket-
ball team should join the football
team in the halls of success.

And as McHenry said:

“Anyway, we beat those ‘damn’

Distinctive academic work by a
Washington and Lee University alum-
nus at Rensselaer Polytechnic Insti-
tute has resulted in a gift of $1,000 in
unrestricted funds to Washington and
Lee from the International Nickel
Company of New York, President
Fred C. Cole has announced.

President F. E. Allen of Internation-
al Nickel informed President Cole that
Edward A. Corcoran of South Rich-
mond Hill, N. Y., a 1960 graduate, has

In his televised report, Dr. Albert-
son will discuss selection of workers,
what skills and abilities will be sought,
salaries to be paid, and what pre-
training will be required of those
chosen. He will also point out the in-
ternational reaction to the U.S. plan.

UCA Plans Discussions

on campuses throughout the country.
In 1959, he was the speaker for the
W&L Religious Emphasis Week.
Having been a student under him for
six years while working on a Ph.D.,,
Dr. Hodges regards Dr. Beach as one
of the most qualified authorities in
the interpretation of Christian eth-
ics and theology.

Dr. Hodges has initiated these dis-
cussions in an effort for several
of the more serious-minded students
to get together informally to examine
how Christianity applies to college
life. Dr. Hodges has emphasized
that he will serve only to officiate
and that the bulk of the discussion will
come from the students themselves.
The studies are to be carried on for
the first half of the semester.

Ashley Wiltshire, DTD sophomore
and Secretary of the UCA, has been
elected chairman of the new seminar.

probably we owe even more to the
development of the gas engine and its
use in the automobile than we do to
World War I. For the automobile and
the hard surface roads which it forced
us to build have been very powerful
forces indeed in binding us together.
The roads probing into the most re-

Students Pass Bar Exams

Dean Light of the Law School has
announced that three students and
two graduates of Washington and
Lee’s Law School have passed the
Virginia State Bar examination. The
three students are Paul X Bolt, John
Page Garrett and Kenneth O. Hunt-
ingdon. George Fralin, LL.B., and
William E. McLaughlin, LL.B., also

Commenting upon the rapid indus-
trial and economic growth now tak-
ing place in the South, Governor Dar-
den pointed out that the area still
trails in actual income. Needed most,
he said, “...is steady improvement in
our system of education. The skills re-
quired by a modern industrial state
cannot take root and flourish in a
population plagued with illiteracy.
Great strides are being made to ov-
ercome this handicap...and another
handicap which is much more insid-
ious and damaging—the education of
a population below its capacity ...We
need a first rate school system...
primarily because it makes for compe-
tency and for a richer and fuller life
for each individual.”
