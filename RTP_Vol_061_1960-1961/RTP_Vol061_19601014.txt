Bill Noell

Freshmen To Elect
EC Member Monday

By DAN BELL
Staff Reporter

Two weeks of campaigning will
be climaxed by the election of the
freshman Executive Committeeman
which will be held Monday at 7
p.m., in Lee Chapel. The floor will
be opened for nominations other
than the two already announced, and
this will be followed by a nominating
speech and a seconding speech for
each candidate.

Each of the two parties, the Uni-
versity and the Independent, have
nominated a candidate.

The University Party’s candidate
is Ed Croft, a KA pledge. He is
from Atlanta, Georgia, where he
graduated from Westminster School.

While a student of Westminster, he
was president of the Honor Council,
a member of the Student Council,
Key Club, and president of his
Junior Class.

Active in Athletics

Croft was active in athletics, serv-
ing as co-captain of the football
and track teams, winning seven let-

ters and four “most valuable player”
awards.

A member of the freshman football
team he is on the Ring-tum Phi
staff, and president of the KA Pledge
Class.

Bill Noell is the Independent Par-
ty’s choice for freshman Executive
Committeeman. Bill graduated from
Bluefield High School in Bluefield,
W. Va. Noell did not pledge a frater-
nity, but expects to go through de-
ferred rush.

President of Student Body

Noell was president of the student
body and salutatorian of his class,
International Vice-President of Key
Club, an Honor Society Member,
and president of both the National
Forensic and the National Thespians.

He plans to participate in spring
sports and join the debate team at
W&L.

The winner of this election will
fill the 12th seat on the EC, the
organization which controls student
body activities and is the judicial
court for honor violations.

 

Student Forum

May Be Held
With Smathers

Washington and Lee students may

- get the chance to hold a student
-|forum with Senator George Smath-

ers of Florida when he comes to
Lexington on Oct. 20.

Charles H. Davidson, a local at-
torney and chairman of the Rock-
bridge County Democratic Commit-
tee, said Wednesday that if there
were “sufficient student interest, then
the possibility of holding a student
forum with the senator following the
regular luncheon meeting might be
worked out.”

Davidson said that he had received
word from Richmond Wednesday
that the Senator would be in Lex-
ington long enough to hold such
a forum for students if they were
interested.

Jerry Hyatt, a Delt junior who
is chairman of W&L’s Students For
Kennedy and Johnson Club, said
today that all students who would
like to attend such a forum should
contact him at HO3-5626 in the
Freshman Dormitory by sometime
tonight, or early Saturday.

“Students must let me or some
member of the Students for Kennedy
Committee know by tomorrow,”
Hyatt said, “because we have to let
the Senator and Mr. Davidson know
if he is to hold such a discussion or
not.”

Davidson said that the forum will
possibly be held on the mezzanine
of the Robert E. Lee Hotel, depend-
ing on the number of students who
plan to attend.

The forum will probably be held
from 3-5 p.m. on Oct. 20, Davidson
added.

Senator Smathers will be in Lex-
ington to address a luncheon at the
Robert E. Lee Hotel at 12:30 on that
day.

At its meeting Tuesday night, the
Young Democrat Club was urged
to support a series of rallies for
the Kennedy-Johnson ticket. These
rallies are to be held up and down
the Shenandoah Valley from Lex-
ington to Winchester. Bill Ford, a
senior law student, is in charge of
obtaining student support for the
rallies.

 

 

Troubs Formally

The Troubadour Theatre of Wash-
ington and Lee University was
adopted as the official name of the
school dramatics organization at a
meeting held last Tuesday evening,

The Troubadour’s new director Dr.
Cecil D. Jones and a committee of
students who had served in official
capacities with the group in the past
presented the meeting with a Con-
stitution and By-laws which were

Organized With New Constitution

unanimously approved. This was the
first time that the campus theatre
has ever considered organizing
around a formal document. In the
past officers and policies had been
determined by choice of the faculty
director alone. Dr. Jones emphasized
that the new Constitution would
give the organization a_ student
governing body with a more direct
| voice in its administration.

Karl Schrag Paintings In duPont;
Two One-Man Shows Slated Next

By JOHN KIRKLEY
Staff Reporter

A collection of paintings by Karl
Schrag is now being exhibited in
duPont Hall. The paintings are from
the Whitney Museum of American
Art and will hang for another two
weeks.

This exhibit is very interesting,
because, through it, one can see the
gradual development and maturation
of an outstanding artist. His early
paintings show his technical pro-
ficiency. In particular, two early self-
portraits give one a distinct impres-
sion of a thoughtful, sincere, and
quite sensitive young man. In an
oil self-portrait dated two decades
later, one can see the artist has de-
veloped and aged mentally as well

as physically. The somber hues of |

the early oil are in direct contrast
to the brighter colors of the later
portrait.

Karl Schrag was born in Kalsruhe,
Germany. His father was German;
his mother was from New York. Karl
was a frail child. When his family
moved to Zurich in 1931, he missed
his frequent excursions into the
Black Forest near his home town.
His passionate interest in nature
dates from this time.

After studying in Geneva, Paris,
and Brussels, he came to New York
with his brother in 1938. Here he
came under the influence of Stanley
Williams Hayter, who has had a

marked and lasting effect on the
life of Schrag.
Schrag’s “Evening Sky” (1954)

exemplifies his growing interest in

color and in the combining of var-
ious media, and shows his develop-
ing passion with the line as a form
of expression. Other painting of this
stage, particularly the beautiful
“Rainstorm,” give evidence of his
early interest in nature, particularly
in the sky, trees, and the ocean.

Pictures of the late forties and
early fifties show a new and im-
portant development in the artistic
life of Schrag. Here he begins to
express such abstract concepts as
heat, fragrance, the sense impres-
sions at certain times of day. We
have titles like “Falling Night,”
“Evening Radiance,” and “Heat
Wave.”

There are lyric and poetic qualities
to his works; there is a deep, almost
innate, and rather mystical feeling
for nature; and there is also a slight
; Oriental flavor in his art. His “Dark
| Trees and “Sunny Meadows,” “Last
Glow in the Woods,” and “Stillness
and Reflection” are good illustra-
tions of these qualities.

 

Finally we come to his master-
pieces of the late fifties. Schrag’s
journey to Spain left a deep impres-
sion on him and on his work. We
see the dry heat of Spain in his
“Oropesa” and in the burning hot
“Red Quarry” of 1958. “The Island,”
one of his masterpieces, dates from
this period.

“Seeing, feeling and thinking are
all combined in my work as they
are in myself.” This quotation and
his sense of the continuity of nature
are seen in “The Sound of the Sea,”

| The Constitution stated three pur-
poses that the Troubadour Theatre
is to strive toward. The Theatre is
to provide an organization to bring
together students interested in the
theatrical arts. It is to provide an op-
portunity for students to gain ex-
perience in mounting theatrical pro-
ductions. Its final purpose will be
to encourage a greater understand-
ing of the theatre as an art among
the students of the University.

The major changes in the Trouba-
dour organization introduced in the
By-laws were the creation of two
new executive positions. There are
now five officers of the Theatre in-
cluding the President, the Seasonal
Stage Manager, the Publicity Direc-
tor, the Personnel Director, and the
Business Manager. This group to-
gether with two members-at-large
will form the Troubadour’s execu-
tive committee.

Also included in the By-laws was
a detailed point system to be used
for determination of members quali-
fication for the group’s two types of
membership and for the various
official duties.

The two types of membership are
Apprentice memberships and Voting
memberships. The Apprentice mem-
berships are open to all newcomers
to the Troubadour’s. This would in-
clude all freshmen interested in
working with the Troubs. Voting
members are those members who
have earned a specified number of
points through service to the Theatre.

The Troubadour Theatre will hold
monthly meetings this year as speci-
fied in its constitution. These meet-
ings will be devoted to programs on
the theatre arts and perhaps include
a series of motion pictures. These
meetings will provide the members
with a background of theatrical his-
tory and lore in addition to practical
production experience.

The Troubadour Theatre will hold
its next meeting on Tuesday evening
at 7 p.m. at the Theatre building.
This meeting will be for the election
of officers for the 1960-61 season.
Freshmen interested in working with
the Troubadours in either acting or
technical capacities are urged to at-
tend this meeting.

 

Six newly selected SWMSFC members.

 

 

Washington and Lee University
will play host Oct. 21-23 to some
800 mothers, fathers, and guardians
of students for the sixth annual
Parents’ Weekend here.

Advaned reservations for hous-
ing and tickets to the parent’s lunch-
eon show that attendance for the
weekend will probably be the largest |
since the program was initiated in
1955.

Purpose of the weekend program
is to provide students’ parents an
opportunity to visit the Washington
and Lee campus, hold individual |
conferences with members of the
faculty and hear reports from uni-
versity and student body officials.

Parents’ Weekend is under the
sponsorship of the university and
the Parents’ Advisory Council, a'|
56-member body whose special in-
terest in Washington and Lee af-
fords an effective communications
channel between the universitiy and
the students’ parents.

James W. Whitehead, assistant to
the president for administration and
director of university relations, heads
up the arrangements for the pro-
gram.

Registration for parents and other
guests will open at 10 am. Friday
and will continue until 9 p.m. Par-
ents requesting conferences will be
able to meet with faculty members
that afternoon.

The Parents’ Advisory Council
will meet at 2:30 p.m. in the confer-
ence room of the year-old Evans
Dining Hall. L. P. Nelson, Jr., of
Culpeper is the 1960 chairman of
the council. His successor will be
named at this session.

Five Washington and Lee facul-
ty members will participate in Fri-
day night’s program at 8. Professor
O. W. Riegel, chairman of the de-
partment of journalism and com-
munications, and Dr. Ollinger Cren-
shaw, professor of history, will de-
bate “Political Campaigning—Then
and Now.” Dr. E. D. Myers, chair-
man of the department of philoso-
phy; and Dr. Marshall W. Fishwick,
professor of American studies, will
discuss “Educational Perspectives at
Home and Abroad.” Both Doctor
Myers and Fishwick have been in
Europe within the last two years.

Dr. Marion Junkin, chairman of
the department of fine arts, will be

Billy Martin Represents
Philip Morris On Campus

Billy Martin, a Sigma Chi senior
from Englewood, N. J., has been
selected by Philip Morris, Inc. as

its Washington and Lee student rep-
resentative for this year.

Martin says that the campus-wide
contests will be larger than ever this
year. Individuals and organizations |
will compete for the prizes on an|
equal basis.

The first contest will begin later
this month, and the rules and prizes |
will be announced at a later date.

 

 

W&L Host To Parents
With Weekend Program

the fifth faculty member of the
evening’s program.

Many parents have scheduled ap-
pointments with their sons’ profes-
sors Saturday morning. The oppor-
tunity to meet face to face with
faculty members has been one of the
most popular features of former
parents’ weekend programs. Some
parents will attend classes with their
sons.

The Student Service Society will
conduct guided tours around the

|campus throughout the morning.

The highlight of Saturday’s sche-
dule will be the annual “Report to
Parents” by university and student
body officials. The 11 a.m. program
will open with a talk by student

| body president R. Kent Frazier of

Tampa, Fla. His talk will be followed
by reports from Dr. William W.
Pusey, Dean of the College; Dr.
Lewis W. Adams, Dean of the School
of Commerce and Business Adminis-
tration; Professor Charles P. Light,
Dean of the School of Law; and
Frank J. Gilliam, Dean of Students
and Director of Admissions.

President Fred C. Cole will close
the program in Doremus Gymnasium
with a report on his work.

A buffet luncheon for parents,
students and faculty will be held
from 12:15 to 1:45 p.m. in the dining
hall.

Parents and guests are then sche-
duled to atend the football game at
Wilson Field between Washington
and Lee and Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity. A Glee Club Concert is set
for 8:30 p.m. in the gymnasium.

The parents are invited to attend
the churches in Lexington Sunday
morning.

Mock Trial Set
For Kidnappers

By C. C. FLIPPEN
Staff Reporter

Students in the Freshman Dorm
were more than mildly shaken from
their studies Wednesday night by
screams of “Kidnappers, you tried
to kidnap me.”

Pouring out of the Dorm, they
were able to witness the opening
act of the Student Bar Association’s
bi-annual Mock Trial.

 

John Hess hes accused Warren
Welsch and Jack Buchanan of kid-
napping him. Hess said the two

students asked him to go for a ride
after he had left the Paramount
Inn. When he got in the car they
drew a gun on him and forced him
to drive. In an effort to escape Hess
said he drove the car into an on-
coming vehicle. In the wreck Welsh
was thrown from the car and re-

| ceived minor injuries. The other car

was driven by John Petzold.
It was later learned from Richard

SW MSFC Selects Members;
W&L Political Lines Broken

Montgomery
Representing
Independents

By ROY GOODWIN
Assistant Managing Editor

Five members of the Student War
Memorial Scholarship Fund Com-
mittee were selected at a meeting
of the organization held last Tuesday
night at the Student Union.

New Members are Dave Montgom-
ery, John Mullin, John Refo, Danny
Markstein, and Lanny Butler.

The election of Montgomery into
the organization, marks the splitting
of the formerly University Party
dominated group. Montgomery is a
Delt sophomore, and is consequently
a member of the Independent Party.

Last Independent in 1955

The last member of the Indepen-
dent Party to become a member of
SWMFC came in 1955 when John
Grobey, also a Delt, was elected to
the group.

Tuesday’s election doesn’t mark

» the first time that Montgomery has
caused political ties to be broken,
as he was elected to Sophomore Class
Secretary in last Spring’s elections.

Montgomery is a member of the
Student Service Society, a former
member of the Ring-tum Phi staff, a
Dean’s List student, and was a mem-
ber of the varsity wrestling team
last year.

From Richmond, Montgomery had
an overall grade-point ratio of 2.4
for last year.

John Mullin is a KA sophomore
from Atlanta. He is an LF.C. repre-
sentative, a former member of the
Ring-tum Phi staff, a member of
the Mongolian Minks, and is a fra-
ternity officer.

John Refo, a Sigma Chi Sopho-
more, is a member of the Assimila-
tion Committee, a member of the
Graham-Lee Society, and is on the
Honor Roll. He is from Norfolk,
and had a 2.66 average last year.

A Birmingham, Ala. sophomore,
Danny Markstein, is the new mem-
ber from ZBT. He is vice president

Alumni Association
Is Re-Activating
Funds Campaign

The Alumni Fund Council of
Washington and Lee University’s
Alumni Association has granted per-
mission for initial planning of the
re-activation of the association’s
drive for funds.

Meeting during the university’s
annual homecoming weekend, the
eight-man council voted to begin im-
mediate organization of the drive.
Actual solicitation from some 7,000
of Washington and Lee’s 10,000
alumni will not begin until after
January 1, 1961.

The re-activated campaign will be
conducted among those alumni who
are not still obligated to Washington
and Lee’s nearly completed capital
funds drive. The campaign will be
handled through class agents and
agents for certain regions throughout
the country.

The Alumni Association’s annual
fund drive has been merged with
Washington and Lee’s two-million
capital funds campaign for the past
two years. The money from the uni-
versity’s drive will be used for new
facilities in science and journalism.

Approximately $113,681 was col-
lected by the Alumni Association in
1958-58—the last year of a full-scale
alumni drive.

Last year, alumni officials received
$21,562 aside from the capital funds
campaign, according to William C.
Washburn, Alumni secretary.

In other activities during the
homecoming weekend, the Alumni
Board of Trustees, the governing
body of the organization named Dr.
Fitzgerald Flournoy, professor of
English at Washington and Lee, as
faculty representative in the edi-
torial board of the quarterly Alumni
Magazine. Rodney Cook of Atlanta,
Ga., will represent the alumni trus-
tees on the magazine’s board.

More than 350 alumni and guests
turned out for the week-end’s ac-
| tivities which were marred by rain
' Saturday.

Let’s Be

Specific

“The difference between coarse and refined abuse
is the difference between being bruised by a club and
wounded by a poison arrow. ”

—Dr. Samuel Johnson

Physical abuse is not justifiable at Washington and Lee,
secretly or otherwise. If the abuse is “refined”? in honorary
induction rites it is still violating university regulations as es-
tablished by the Board of Trustees and radified by the Admin-
istrative Committee of the Faculty.

In a special session of the Executive Committee last year

the following was adopted:

“The Executive Committee of the Student Body requests |

that the Administrative Committee of the Faculty and the uni-
versity re-afirm and re-interpret the abolition of physical haz-
ing in the fraternities to cover all campus organizations.”
Perhaps it is wrong to assume that an organization must jus-
tify its existence, but justify its abusive practices—it cannot.
For this reason the societies or fraternities fall subject to
university restriction and should be dealt with accordingly.

 

Secret Societies, Vann’s Topic;
Is Justification Necessary?

By JIM VANN
Friday Columnist

With the fall initiations into the
various “secret societies” there has
arisen here on the
campus, editorially
speaking at any
rate, quite a flurry
in regard to the
status of these
clubs. In one ar-
ticle the societies
were strongly re-
buked for viola-
tions of the Uni-
versity regulations
and asked to either
justify their exist-
ence or leave the campus. As far as
the first of these objections goes, I
feel that it is hardly necessary for
me to state my opinion. Washington
and Lee has the perfect right to de-
mand of her students anything that
she chooses as long as she makes
these demands clear to the student
body before they enter the Universi-
ty. Any group that runs afoul of the
University regulations is certainly
liable, as far, as I am concerned, to
discipline from the University.

 

But it is the second part of the
argument that I would take issue
with—the demand to the groups to
either justify their existence or leave
the campus. Why should a group of
friends have to justify its association
to anyone? Has it gotten to the
point in America where a group has
to submit a body of altruistic prin-
ciples to the public at large before
its existence is to be permitted? It
really seems nowadays that any
slight deviation from the norms of
mediocrity that society sets for it-
self immediately results in pressure
from the group to conform, ie., put
forth a body of principles that has
our approval, or get out.

Where Is Spirit of Freedom?

Where is the American spirit of
vigorous freedom? What’s all this

 

business of conformity! If men want
to get together and form a social
club of their friends as long as the
club is willing to operate within the
bounds of propriety, where does
the other element even have the right
to criticize? What is the basis upon
which they even stand in making
their complaint? This is just like the
policy that other schools have taken
in regard to making their fraternities
operate on the 100 per cent basis.
When the groups become dictated to
by outside organizations and their
membership becomes predetermined,
then the word fraternity becomes a
contradiction in terms.

Not Democracy

This is not what is meant by de-
mocracy! Entirely too many people
today have come to believe that de-
mocracy means that no one has the
right to have anything that anyone
else doesn’t have. This couldn’t be
further from the truth. A democracy
entitles each person to earn what he
can. All men are equal in that they
have equal chances but they certain-
ly are not all equal in ability and
personality. And if a group of like-
minded people want to get together
in an_ association, then there
should be no one to deny them that
right .

Sigma Is Example

Take for example the Sigma club.
Perhaps I am sticking my neck out
in using this group as an example
since I am not a member and, there-
fore, know nothing about it. But it
is a secret society and one that
seems to be surrounded with a great
deal of prestige and mystery. Why
should a group such as this of com-
patible friends be denied the right
of association or made to put forth
a bunch of principles for the world to
inspect? What’s wrong with them
simply saying that they are a sec-
ret group and being as selective and
exclusive as they choose. And if they

McLin Gives American’s View Of Oxford

 

By JON B. McLIN
Friday Columnist

(Editor’s Note: This is the first
of a series of articles to be written
by Washington and Lee graduate
McLin, Class of 1960, who is pres-
ently a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford
University in England. McLin, a
former Editor-in-Chief of the
Ring-tum Phi, plans to write a
column to be published every other
week in the Friday Edition.)

Wadham College, Oxford, Oct. 9—
The first thing to confront a fresh-
man who “comes up” to Oxford for

Brownlee Writes

 

the first time is college life. This is
a way of organizing one’s living
which is peculiar to Oxford and
Cambridge among the universities of
the world.

It is often surprising to those who
hold the University of Oxford in
great awe that the only functions
of the University here are to ar-
range lecture programs, give ex-
aminations, and bestow degrees.
Virtually everything else—and that
is quite a lot—falls within the domain
of Oxford’s 31 colleges.

Oxonian colleges are complexes of
life which really have no counter-
parts in the States. Each college is
a compact unit consisting of its own
rooms for commoners, scholars, and
fellows (or dons); its own dining
hall, or simply “hall,” as it is called
here; its own library; its own chapel;
often its own gardens; more fre-
quently its own bar; and always its
own clubroom, called the Junior
Common Room, where meetings and
discussions are held and current
magazines and newspapers of several
countries may be read.

All of these several parts are
under one roof, usually. Moreover,
the schematic arrangement of them is
very similar for all colleges, with the
buildings forming around one or
more quadrangles. Any sides which
are not enclosed by buildings are
blocked by high stone walls; some of
these have myriads of fragments of
broken glass imbedded in the tops
to prevent mischievous students’
climbing over the top.

About Rules;

Gives Other Side Of Argument

By MALCOLM BROWNLEE
Friday Columnist

Two weeks ago this column showed
how rules weaken traditions at
Washington and Lee. It argued
against placing new requirements on
students. Obviously there are many
arguments for additional rules on
campus; so this week I will try to
present the other side of the story.
This argument has the advantage of
having been begun in rhymed lines
and the disadvantage of having been
finished that way.

There’ve been many _ complaints
about our debauching and drink-
ing,

About vulgar misconduct and stu-
dent’s not thinking.

joying

For this, fellow students, we should
never feel shame,

For we are not the ones who're
subject to blame.

We are babes in this land of free
living and thought.

Who can expect us to act as we
ought?

and what’s right.

Senator Goldwater’s Conservatism Refuted

By VIC LASSETER
Friday Columnist

In the 1960 Presidential campaign
John F. Kennedy is the candidate
of the moderate Democratic party.
Richard M. Nixon, however, is the
candidate of the radical Republican
party. No longer can Nixon charge
that the Democratic party is too “ex-
treme,” as he did on his first tele-
vision debate, or that the Demo-
cratic party is the party of “treason,”
as he did in 1952 and 1956.

Ironically enough, the party of
Nixon is the center of radical in-
fluence; the century-old Republican
charge of “socialists” will no longer
be used to label the Democratic
party; obvious hyprocisy cannot
fool the American television audi-
ences all of the time.

The center of Republican radi-
calism is Senator Barry Goldwater
from Arizona, who looks more like a
middle-class department store owner

 

than a senator. Goldwater’s party,
however, is more radical than any
Democratic New Deal legislation,
which was only progressive at best.

In a recent editorial (“Who’s A
Conservative,” October 10, 1960) The
New Republic pointed out very suc-
cintly that Barry Goldwater is not a
conservative (generally defined as
“one who favors the conservation
of existing institutions and forms of
government”), but rather a radical
(generally defined as “one who ad-
vocates sweeping changes in laws and
methods of government”).

A good look at Goldwater’s best-
seller, Conscience of a Conservative,
will show the validity of the New
Republic’s pertinent observations.
Domestically, Goldwater advocates
sweeping changes which will take
the U.S. back to its pre-Teddy
Roosevelt days; Goldwater will strip
the Federal government of all func-

 

tions not expressly given to it by

the Constitution; Goldwater will
abolish Social Security, which he
describes as a harsh restriction upon
individual enterprise, and even more
radical, Goldwater will abolish pro-
gressive taxation.

Goldwater’s justification for the
abolition of progressive taxation is
an example of the naivite, self-
righteousness, chauvinism, and plain
ignorance which have helped make
Goldwater’s book a best-seller. Since
the average American, reasons
Goldwater, pays 32 per cent of his
income in taxes to the federal gov-
ernment, one-third of this man’s
income is confiscated, this man is
spending one-third of his time work-
ing for the federal government, and,
alas, the nation is already one-third
socialized. No true conservative
could believe this nonsense, for
author Goldwater omits the fact that
most of this tax money is indirectly

 

returned to the taxpayer through

indirect government services, such
as through our court system, for
example.

Senator Goldwater, moreover, pur-
posefully omits the fact that over
one-half of this tax goes for de-
fense spending, and if there is one
form of federal spending pleasing
to Goldwater, it is defense spending.
Goldwater, moreover, would increase
federal spending and taxation to
provide for an American offensive
against the Communist bloc of na-
tions.

Goldwater’s foreign policy is no
less radical than his domestic policy;
Goldwater would refuse to recog-
nize Communist governments; he
would break off all negotiations with
them (for the present) and, in direct
contradiction to international law
and common morality, would en-
courage internal revolt in Commun-
ist nations. The United Nations,

The reason that such practices are
necessary is that all colleges lock
their gates at midnight, and—theoret-
ically—students cannot get in after
this hour without paying a fine.
In practice, each college has one
or more well-known places where
entry can be gained at any hour.

It is an interesting commentary
on college discipline that when one
of these “escape hatches” was acci-
dentally blocked recently by a
grounds-keeper who was unfamiliar
wih the traditions of Oxford, the
Dean of the college immediately
ordered the hole re-opened. He did
not, however, let it be known that
this had been called to his attention.

Such rules, even though they are
largely ignored, are inconsistent with
the general tenor of student free-
dom, which is considerable. Colleges
frequently have their own bars, and
college butteries frequently sell to
the students the liquor which they
may, if they wish, use in their rooms.

Even more liberal, by W&L stand-
ards, is the permission to admit
women guests to rooms in college,
provided they are out by 10 p.m.

If the American who comes to Ox-
ford is pleased by the leniency of
the rules, he will not be happy about
the material comforts and conven-
iences which are available. Bath-
rooms are frequently outdoors, and
even when indoors they are often
unheated. Where hot water is far
away, the Oxonian receives, on
awakening, one bowl of water in

 

which he is to wash, shave, and
brush his teeth.

Much can be done, however to-
wards overcoming material “hard-
ships” if one has a sympathetic un-
derstanding, and knowing scout. The
scout, or manservant, is assigned to
4-6 students and for them renders
the following services (if he is com-
petent): awakes you for breakfast;
washes the dishes, cleans the room
and makes the bed; procures for
you such items as bicycles and
gowns, which can be bought eco-
nomically second-hand; offers help-
ful advice to those unfamiliar with
English ways.

The importance of such advice is
well-illustrated by a custom called
the “sconce,” which is practiced in
most college dining halls. According
to this tradition, if a student comes
to dinner without a tie, mentions
religion or a girl’s name during he
course of the meal, smokes after din-
ner, or commits any breach of social
etiquette or gentlemanly conduct he
may be challenged to drink in three
minutes a large quantity of ale (the
quantity varies, but averages around
2 1/2 pints). If he succeeds he chal-
lenges his challenger; this continues
until one of the two loses, and the
loser pays for the ale. In case of
dispute, appeal may be made to the
High Table, but such appeal must
be made in grammatical Greek,
Latin, or Hebrew. This often proves
embarrassing to appellant and High
Table alike.

Dr. Moger, History Prof,
Discusses En glish Systems

By ALLEN W. MOGER
Professor of History

My six weeks spent last summer observing the teaching and
methods of instruction at the University of London was a
stimulating and enlightening experience. I also visited the
great universities at Oxford and Cambridge where methods

are similar to those in London.

To me, observing and participating
in the work of a tutorial group was
the most valuable. This group is di-
rected and led by a faculty member
who is a specialist in his field, and
it is in this group that the individ-
ual student’s work is pretty thor-
oughly supervised by the tutor in
charge. Each group is small. Stu-
dents present papers and participate
in the discussion of each paper pre-
sented. Also private conferences
with the tutor provide direction and
supervision of the work of each stu-
dent as he “reads” in his major sub-
ject for a degree.

A much smaller proportion of the
population goes to college in Eng-
land than in the United States, and
the students are better prepared,
more mature and self-reliant when
they start. This selection of the best
prospects seems almost demanded
by the methods and requirements
which the students must meet.

A student at Eton told me, “I
doubt if I can get into a college in
England. I think I shall go to college
in the States like my brother did.”
However, college students are now
selected on a much more democratic
basis than they used to be.

Social position and wealth count
for less, and many able students
without much economic means now
get into the great universities of Eng-
land. However, the fact remains that
only between ninety and a hundred
thousand out of a population of about
52,000,000 attend college in England.

In America we have 4,000,000 col-
lege students from a population of
175,000,000. Perhaps too few go to
college in England and too many in
America, but if I had to choose be-
tween the two in the modern world
I would choose the American policy
of greater opportunity. England’s
college attendance has greatly in-
creased since the war.

While a student in an English uni-
versity has much freedom in theory,
there are restrictions. He must be
in his quarters before twelve. At
Cambridge he must wear his aca-
demic robe when he goes down town

*

 

in the evening or when he calls on
his tutor or professor for a con-
ference. Requirements of this kind
vary, but in general a student must
conduct himself honorably and by
his work and habits make himself a
credit to the school. Failure to meas-
ure up may cause him to be asked
to make way for someone more
worthy.

A summer spent in the great city
of London provides many fabulous
opportunities for an American. As a
teacher of British history I visited
dozens of places and_ institutions
which I had read and talked about
for years. Cathedrals, castles, mu-
seums, eighteenth century country
estates, the homes of Dr. Johnson,
Keats, and many other prominent
figures are there.

Many enjoyable trips to famous
places were arranged and conducted
as a part of the summer course at
the University of London. Trips to
some places such as Oxford, Cam-
bridge, Windsor Castle, and Hamp-
ton Court were made more mean-
ingful and enjoyable by a lecture
the night before on the history and
architecture of the place to be visited.
And guides arranged for by the
University were better informed than
the usual tourist guide.

Independently, one can see many
excellent plays on the London stage
at prices much below those in New
York. Also among my very en-
joyable experiences were trips to
Canterbury, to the English Lake
Country made famous by Words-
worth, to Edinburgh and its “Royal
Mile” extending from Edinburgh
Castle to Holy Rood Palace, to other
parts of Scotland, and to Chester
and York.

Such a summer in England is
available to students who have fin-
ished at least two years of college
work in America,

I spend ten delightful days in
Paris and vicinity with Professor
Francis Drake, and three days in
Rome before flying to London. I
recommend such a summer to any
interested and inquiring student.

Bootmen Fall To Duke, 3-0,
Meet Carolina Wednesday

A complacent Washington and Lee
varsity squad, resting on the laurels
of its first two wins of the 1960
season, succumbed to an aggressive

Duke team at Durham, N. C., last
Tuesday.
The W&L booters lacked the

drive which had been character-
istic of their previous matches.
The play for the Generals was
sluggish both offensively and de-
fensively. The offensive could never
sustain an attack on the Blue Devil’s
goal and the defense could never
get off their heels to clear the ball
to the forward line. Misjudged kicks
and poorly executed pass patterns
typified the style of soccer played
by the W&L club.

Duke opened the scoring on a
penalty kick with nine minutes
gone in the first period. Washing-
ton and Lee threatened to tie the
game but failed to take full ad-
vantage of the opposing team’s mis-
takes. The half ended with the score
still one to nothing. Early in the
third period, a failure in teamwork
on the part of W&L accounted for
another Blue Devil tally. A pressured

attack on the Duke goal by the
Blue and White ended abruptly
when the Generals’ center-forward
missed a beautiful scoring opportuni-
ty on an indirect kick. The Duke
eleven scored again in the fourth
period to make the final score, 3-0.
The only bright light on this rath-
er dismal day was the exceptionally
fine play of Clark Valentiner who, as
W&L’s goalie, made twenty-five
saves. Also, with this defeat, comes

 

the guarantee form Coach Lyles and
the varsity soccer team that the
rest of opposition this fall will not
find the goin so easy.

The Generals get a chance to re-
deem themselves when they meet
North Carolina next Wednesday in
a home contest. The Tarheels have
always proved to be a formidable
opponent, but this year it will take
more than just a “big-name uni-
versity to defeat our eleven angry

&L Aim Saturday:

By JOHN ALLGOOD

After Washington and Lee rallied
to tie Randolph-Macon, 33-33, in a
wild mele last year, the Yellow
Jackets promised their fans a sure
victory over W&L this year.

But Coach Lee McLaughlin and his
Five-Star Generals have different
ideas.

The Generals go into tomorrow’s
clash with R-M at Ashland with a
three-game win streak and have
no intentions of letting the Jackets
snap that victory string.

After three games W&L has only
one trouble spot—pass defense. Two
of the three touchdowns against the
Generals have come on passes and
the other TD was set up by a pass.

* The Generals have actually given

up less yardage (241-249) in the air
than on the ground. But the passing
gains have come on the crucial plays
and have given the Generals some
anxious moments.

Probably the main reason that the
Generals’ loose pass defense hasn’t
hurt them to a large extent is that
none of their first three opponents—
Centre, Dickinson, and F&M—had
a top notch passer.

But Randolph-Macon does not
fall into the lack-of-a-good-passer
category.

The Yellow Jackets have a very
capable passer, Jim Gravett, and
two fine receivers, ends LeRoy
Davenport and Walt Pendley, who
will give the Generals’ pass defense
its toughest challenge of the young
season.

R-M threw only two passes (both
were intercepted) in their 14-6 loss
to Western Maryland last week. But
Coach McLaughlin is quick to point
out that the Yellow Jackets are a
passing team.

“We're not letting Randolph-Ma-
con’s two passes against Western
Maryland lull us into thinking we
won't be seeing any passes,” Mc-
Laughlin said.

McLaughlin said that Randolph-
Macon will be “the toughest op-
ponent we’ve met so far” and has
greater depth than any team W&L
has faced this season.

 

4th Straight Victory

Last Saturday Coach McLaughlin
unleashed the full fury of W&L’s
Go-T and Spread offensives against
helpless Franklin and Marshall.

The Generals ground out 430 yards
on the ground and added another 100
yards in the air as they crushed
the Diplomats, 38-8.

Despite the aweing running and
kicking show put on by Doug Mar-
tin, the Five-Star Generals’ 159-
pound junior fullback, McLaughlin
called the W&L success a “real
team victory.” “But didn’t Doug
have a good day!” he added quickly.

Martin had a good day indeed.
He had his biggest day in his W&L
career.

The pint-sized fullback, who gives
the Generals breakaway potential
as a position where they’ve never
had it before, picked up 176 yards

*“HOME SWEET HOMECOMING”

A great number of people have been asking me lately, “What
is Homecoming?” but I have been so busy trying to find out
why my new sports car leaks that I haven’t had time to answer.
I am now pleased to report that I finally discovered why my
sports car leaks—I have been driving it upside down—and so
I am ready today to turn my attention to Homecoming.
Let’s begin with definitions. Homecoming is a weekend when
old grads return to their alma maters to watch a football game,
visit old classrooms and dormitories and inspect each other’s

bald spots.

The weekend is marked by the singing of old songs, the slap-
ping of old backs and the frequent exchange of such greetings
as “Harry, you old polecat!” or “Harry, you old porcupine!”

or “Harry, you old rooster!” or

“Harry, you old wombat!”

As you can see, all old grads are named Harry.

It is not just old grads who behave with such liveliness during
Homecoming; the faculty also comports itself with unaccus-
tomed animation. Teachers laugh and smile and pound backs
and keep shouting “Harry, you old Airedale!” This unscholarly
behavior is carried on in the hope that old grads, in a transport
of bonhomie will endow a new geology building.

The old grads, however, are seldom seduced. By game time
on Saturday their backs are so sore, their eyeballs so eroded,
their extremities so frayed, that it is impossible to get a kind
word out of them, much less a new geology building.

\ lawy ye al Mindi t

   

Even the football game does not improve their tempers.
“Hmmph!” they snort as the home team completes a 101-yard
march to a touchdown. “Do you eall that football? Why, back
in my day, they’d have been over on the first down! By
George, football was football in those days—not this namby-
pamby girls’ game that passes for football today! Take a look
at that bench—50 substitutes sitting there. Why, in my day,
there were 11 men on a team and that was it. When you broke
a leg, they slapped a piece of tape on it and you went right back

in. Why, I remember the big game against State.

Harry Siga-

foos, our star quarterback, was killed in the third quarter. I

mean, he was pronounced dead.

But did that stop old Harry?

Not on your tintype! Back in he went and kicked the winning
drop kick in the last four seconds of play, dead as he was. Back
in my day, they played football, by George!”

Everything, say the old grads, was better back in their day —

everything except one.

Even the most unreconstructed of the

old grads has to admit that back in his day they never had a
smoke like Marlboro—never a cigarette with such a lot to like
—never a filter so easy drawing, a flavor so mild yet hearty, so
abundant, so bountiful—never a choice of flip-top box or soft

pack.

So old grads, young grads, and undergrads, why don’t you

settle back and have a full-flavored smoke?
filtered cigarette with the unfiltered taste,

Try Marlboro, the
and Homecoming

will be a happy occasion and the sun will shine and the air will
be filled with the murmur of wings and no man’s hand will be

raised against you.

tered companion cigarette—mild, flavorful Philip Morris...

moreover, would be used only as

In short, Mr. Goldwater, who calls
himself a “conservative,” would de-
stroy all of the machinery for world-
peace which has been constructed
since Wilson’s abortive League of
Nations.

The logical consequences of such
a foreign policy are disgusting, un-
American, and frightening. Gold-
water makes few attempts to cover
up his bellicosity, chauvinistic at-
titude; he claims that America must
not compete with the Communists,
America must defeat the Commun-
ists, by war if necessary. Goldwater

policy “runs the risk of war and
holds forth the promise of victory.”

in 13 carries—an average of 12.9
yards a carry. He scored two of
the Generals five touchdowns on
runs of 26 and 85 yards and added
quick kicks of 61 and 54 yards for
extra flavor.

Another standout was junior end
Ned Hobbs. Hobbs blocked Terry
Gebhard’s punt on the Diplomat
20, picked up the loose football on
the two, and stepped into the end-
zone for the Generals’ fourth touch-
down.

Although the offense led by Mar-
tin, Bob Funkhouser, Tommy Keesee,
and Steve Suttle, received most of
the praise, the iron defense, anchored
by Barton Dick, Terry Fohs, and
Tommy Goodwin, completely con-
tained F&M’s highly-rated ground
express, John Tomasko.

The Diplomats managed to
punch out only 78 yards on the
ground against W&L’s stonewall
defense, and Tomasko accounted
for more than half of that 78-yard
total with a 46-yard run just be-
fore the half.

Only after the Diplomats took to
the air, did they manage to score or
gain any appreciable amount of
yardage.

water admirably enough, isn’t afraid
of a few little old H-Bombs.

Thus, the policies of Barry Gold-
water, as seen in The Conscience of a
Conservative, are indications of the
radicalism in the extreme right-
wing of the Republican party. Sen-
ator Goldwater, of course, controls

and therefore exerts a considerable
influence upon Richard M. Nixon

Southern conseravtive Democrats

“More rules?” Yes, more rules.

Prolific, specific, significant rules;

Refined and declined, magnificent
rules;

Rules of right conduct and
of right thought

So that everyone here will act and
think as he ought,

Rules that will outline each thing
we should do,

And cover each detail of life through
and through.

Vann On Secret Societies
(Continued from page 2)

want to make branding as a criterion
for membership, then why shouldn’t
they be permitted to do so? No one
has forced anybody to join the group
and so the group, it would seem to
me, has the perfect right to set any
criteria it chooses for membership.

Everyone May Decline

Every person invited certainly has
the right to decline. This group has
never made any attempt to clothe
itself in any false principles—indeed,
I never even knew it existed until
I noticed several of my friends wear-
ing rings with the letter on them.
The point is simply that they have
never violated any democratic prin-
ciples; and I don’t think that it’s
right to deny groups of people the
right to get together and form clubs.

There is too much of a tendency
in America, and especially here at
W&L to try to weld all people onto
one common level. People are not all
alike and as long as they are all
given the right to better themselves
to the limit of their ability then the
fundamental rights of democracy are
being maintained.
