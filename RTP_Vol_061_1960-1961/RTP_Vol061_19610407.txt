Woody Herman and his nation-
ally known band will play at the
Friday night dance of Springs it
was announced today by Dance
Board President, Jimmy Vann.

Benny Goodman, who was ex-
pected to play for the dance Fri-
day night, will not be able to per-
form here due to a last-minute,
unexpected change of events. The
trumpet section of his band has
been signed to play on the Dinah
Shore show Sunday.

Nationally Ranked

Last year, Herman was the fourth
ranked clarinet player in the nation
by the Playboy All-Star Jazz pole.
He was born in Milwaukee in 1913
and sang and danced in_ local
theatres from early childhood. In
1936, he formed his own band after
performing with numerous other
groups. He quickly gained a reputa-
tion as the “Band that Plays the
Blues.” His greatest fame was at-
tained in the 40’s, when he got Dave
Matthews, an arranger and saxo-
phonest to work with him. The work
of Matthews and Herman produced
a unique sound while strongly bear-
ing the “Ellington touch.”

Through the years such famous
musicians in the Jazz world as Joey

Harry Sisnock and Gus Arnheim

Herman is well known for his ar-
rangements from “Perfido,” with its |
gently swinging pace to “I Ain’t Got
Nothin’ but the Blues.” The trumpet
effects attained are noted throughout
the Jazz world.

The cocktail party given Friday -

afternoon will be in honor of Bill
Outman, Dance Set President. The

party will be held in Red Square ,°
from 4-6 (weather permitting). The =

Five Royals, working out of New
York, will provide the entertain-
ment.

night dance will highlight

president, Bill Outman, is centering

The oriental motif combined with %
the Herman jazz idiom will set the =

1961 Spring Dance apart as one of
the most unique ever held.

This year, the schedule of the
Spring Dance Set has been changed
in an effort by Jimmy Vann to gain
more student interest in the dance
and concert. Last year Claude
Thornhill played for a Friday night
formal dance and Joni James gave
a concert on Saturday night sup-
ported by Thornhill’s band. The plan
for this year is for a Saturday af-
ternoon concert by an as yet un-
announced jazz artist and Woody
Herman’s performance Friday night.

 

Dr. Germaine Bree Talks
On Modern French Writers

Dr. Germaine Bree, a permanent! U.S. in 1936 and was naturalized in

member of the Institute for Research
in the Humanities at the University
of Wisconsin, will address a Wash-
ington and Lee audience Monday,
April 10, at 8 p.m. in duPont Audi-
torium. The public is invited.

Dr. Bree, a noted authority on
French Literature and the late
French author Albert Camus, will
speak on “The Writer and Our
Time: Malreaux, Satre, Camus.”
Also, an article on Camus by Dr.
Bree will appear in the forthcom-
ing issue of Shenandoah magazine.

Her lecture is being sponsored by
the Department of Romance Lan-
guages in cooperation with the Uni-
versity Center in Virginia.

Dr. Bree was licensed from the
University of Paris in 1930 and did
graduate work at Bryn Mawr Col-
lege in 1931-32. She came to the

ing the last three days of rehearsals.
Cast and orchestra are putting the
final touches on Steve Danzansky’s

1952.

Her activities have included teach-
ing in Algeria 1932-36 and the
chairmanship of the French Depart-
ment of New York University. She
also rose from instructor to profes-
sor at Bryn Mawr. In the period
1950-53, she was a member of the
selection committee of student Ful-
bright awards and served a term as
chairman of the committee. She was

 

farsical adaptation of Aristophanes’|

“The Lysistrata.”

Commenting on this year’s pro-
duction, writer-director Danzansky
says, “I am very pleased with the
progress of the whole show. The
people in the cast and orchestra
and behind the stage have worked
herd and have exceeded the limit
of expectation.”

Demanding Schedule
The rehearsal schedule this week-

 

 

end will be a demanding one with)

two run-throughs planned for Sat-
urday and another two set for Sun-
day.

It is interesting to note that a
musical adaptation of “the Lysis-
trata” opened last week in New York
to generally poor reviews. Dan-
zansky, on the Broadway perform-
ance, says, “the very fact of the
mediocrity of the New York musical
was attributed to a lack of spark
on the part of the cast and the
script itself. We feel that our script
and cast maintain a high level of
comedy and perform with great
gusto and esprit de corps. With the
great amount of spirit shown by the
people working in the show I don’t
see how we can possibly fail.”

Tickets are sold out for the week-
end performances, but seats can still
be obtained for the week-day shows.
Dave Montgomery, a Delt sopho-
more, is in charge of sales and

tickets will be sold during the week-| ment in future antitrust enforce-

Dr. Phillips in Law Review

An article on “The Consent Decree
in Antitrust Enforcement” by Dr.
Charles F. Phillips, Jr., assistant
professor of economics at Washing-
ton and Lee University, appears in
the Spring issue of the university’s
Law Review.

The article deals with the develop-
ment and use of the consent decree
as a major instrument in the Anti-
trust Division’s program to enforce
antitrust laws. The use of consent
decrees has resulted in substantial
controversy, Dr. Phillips points out.

The article discusses the nature,
legal basis, and the use of the con-
sent decree as well as its results.
Suggestions are also made as to
how the consent decree could be
made an even more effective instru-

Dr. William Mueller Addresses

English-Religion

Dr. William Mueller, chairman of
the department of English at Gouch-
er College, held a series of lectures
and discussions this past week under
the joint sponsorship of the Semi-
nars in Literature and Seminars in
Religion programs. This was the
first of the Religion seminars—a
program which has been jointly
organized by the UCA and the de-
partment of Religion.

Professor Mueller’s special inter-
est in the religious insights in mod-
ern “secular” literature is based
upon his conviction that much of our
ostensibly religious writing is hard-
ly worth the time of a person seek-
ing religious insights or aesthetic
satisfaction.”

Tuesday evening, April 4th, Dr.

-| Mueller concerned himself with the
‘| broad topic of Religion and Con-
-| temporary Literature in opening the

series in duPont auditorium. Cit-
ing the English literature of the
seventeenth-century as exemplary
of literature of “Biblical Commit-

-| ment,” he proposed that John Donne,

George Herbert, and John Milton
brought this genre to a peak of
fulfillment.

That evening he continued to de-
velop this thesis in contemporary

i literature using the plays of T. S.
‘Eliot as
| modern ettempts to represent this
‘biblical motif in expression.

In Wednesday’s talk, Dr. Mueller
proposed a second area of study
which tended to enforce his thesis
of Religion and Contemporary Lit-
erature and he called this the lit-
erature of “Ultimate Concern.” Af-

Fulbright Grant

James A. Vann, III, Phi Psi senior
from Birmingham, Ala., is a Ful-
bright Scholar. The International
Exchange Service announced in a
release yesterday that Vann had
received a grant to study Modern
History at the University of Vienna.

In becoming the first W&L student
to receive the coveted award for
1961-62, Vann joins 900 other college
students who will study abroad next
year, courtesy of the U.S. State De-
partment.

For Better Understanding

The funds used to finance these
exchanges are part of the foreign
currencies or credits owed to or
owed by the Treasury of the United
Stetes. Under executive agreements
with foreign governments, arrange-
ments have been made for foreign
study by US. college students. The

Mueller settled on the late Albert

Dr. Mueller spent a great portion

Counselors
For 1961-62
To Be Chosen

Applications are invited for the
position of Freshman Dormitory
Counselor for the session of 1961-62,
Frank J. Gilliam Dean of Students
announces. Applicants must be at
least current sophomores and appli-
cations should furnish information
as to any routine commitments after
8 p.m. that would normally take a
Counselor from the dormitory for
any appreciable time.

While counselorships are not
awarded on an academic basis, a
student who has failed to maintain
a C average would probably not be
selected. The selection of Counselors
is made on the personal qualifica-
tions of the applicant, apart from
financial need.

Should Take Dinner

It is desired to have as many
Freshman Dormitory Counselors as
possible to take dinner (the seated
evening meal) with the freshmen.
Applicants for dormitory counselor
positions should state in their ap-
plication whether they do or do not
wish to take dinner in the dining
hall. Those applicants who elect to
take dinner in the dining hall and
who are selected as Counselors will
not be charged for the meal. The
small cash compensation to Fresh-
man Dormitory Counselors will be
continued next session for those
Counselors who do not take dinner
in the dining hall, but not for those
signing up for dinner in the dining
hall. The main financial compensa-
tion for all Counselors will continue
to be a room.

Applications should be filed in the
Office of the Dean of Students by
Saturday, 15 April.

 

Placement

The managing editor of the
Charleston (CW. Va.) Daily Mail
will be on the Washington and
Lee campus Wednesday, April 12,
to interview students interested in
a career in the field of journalism.
Arrangements for an _ interview
appointment may be made with

A Dance Proposal

The lack of student support for the university dance set
has grown to be a major problem for both the student body
and the faculty sponsors. Some action must be taken to cor-
rect the flaws in the system and to bring back student interest
in the dances. We are are not alone in this view. Steve Galef,
incoming president of the Dance Board, has presented several
proposals to the IFC for action at a future meeting.

We would like to make some recommendations that, if initi-
ated, might improve student attendance at the dances. Some
of our ideas coincide with changes which the Dance Board will
make next year—in these cases we wish to offer support for

We would not in any way attempt to distract from the credit |
due the present Dance Board in its effort to present dance sets
which would attract crowds. But in the hope of offering a con-
structive and successful program, we would like to suggest
the following alterations.

Beginning with Opening Dances, we support the Dance
Board plan for next year to combine Homecomings and Open-
ings into one big weekend. This consolidation, which we feel
is overdue, guarantees three improvements. First, it eliminates
any conflicts which have stemmed in the past from trying to
schedule Parents’ Weekend and two social events in a four or
five week period. Secondly, the combined weekend gives as-
surance that the student body will not be distracted from the
dance by an away football game at a nearby school as has
hapened in recent years. Thirdly, the Dance Board will gain
some additional income from alumni attending the Saturday
night dance, thus making possible a more attractive selection of
bands,

For Opening Dances, we would also suggest a moratorium
on or a voluntary waiving of Saturday night combo rights by
the fraternities. Not only would the elimination of Saturday
night combos cut the expense of the weekend for the student,
it would also remove a major barrier to attendance at the dance.
In case that combo rights were waived by the fraternities, we
suggest the IFC permit the fraternities to have one more party
weekend during the first semester. If such a plan were adopted,
there would be fewer parties and students could enjoy both
the combo and the dance band, something which is virtually
impossible under the present system.

While Fancy Dress is now the biggest dance weekend of the
year, we would like to see it made even more spectacular. To
provide the funds necessary for extra decorations and the
very best.bands, we would cut expenses on Finals Dance, a set
which few students attend anyway.

_ The Spring Dance weekend, we believe, should become a
traditional jazz weekend. The presentation of jazz bands then
would relieve the monotony of the regular bands and combos
and would allow the Dance Board to attract some of the better
known names in entertainment. The idea of holding an out-of-
doors concert. at Springs—weather permitting—strikes us as
an excellent idea.

We would also suggest moving the dance sets from the
rather drab gymnasium to Evans Dining Hall. The setting
would certainly be more attractive. And the facilities for offer-
ing refreshments and sitting room are far more adequate.
While holding dances in the Hall might be inconvenient for
the Slater people, there are only four dance sets—and most of
the necessary changes could be made by students.

All in all, we feel the dance sets are very worthwhile, and
we do not wish to see them curtailed or eliminated. Changes
are needed in the program, that is true. But with a Dance Board
sensitive to the students’ demands there is no reason why the
Dance Sets cannot again become the central attraction on
our important weekends. —G. E. H.

Called ‘The

By VICTOR LASSETER

Friday Columnist

America has always had a goodly
number of self-righteous patriotic
societies, but not
even the American
Legion can com-
pare to the con-
troversial John
Birch Society, an
anti - communist
group which has
been making
headlines during
the last few
weeks.

It all started
when parts of The
Politician, a book written by the
Society’s founder, former business-
man Robert Welch, leaked out to the
press. The Politican was privately
published and circulated among the
elite of the party, and necessarily
so, for Welch’s book contains some
remarks which are widely regarded
as seditious libel. For instance,
Welch’s book makes the unqualified
statement that “Milton Eisenhower
is actually Dwight Eisenhower's
superior and boss within the Com-
munist Party.” The late John Foster
Dulles, of course, “was a communist
agent.”

Strongly Defended in Press

In spite of these charges, which
have no slight resemblance to Hit-
ler’s “big lie,” the John Birch So-
ciety has been strongly defended
in the press and in the senate, and
even includes several congressmen
in its organization, which is struct-
urally similar to the communist cell
organization.

Several congressmen, however,
have demanded that the Society be
investigated by the House Un-
American Activities Committee, on
the grounds that sedition, whether
from the left or from the right, is
sedition. Welch’s reaction to this
criticism has been a cool one; he
actually invited the Committee to
investigate his organization. He has
denied calling Eisenhower a Com-
munist, but as yet has not explained
away The Politician.

Doesn’t Want Investigation
At least one official in the So-

Lasseter

tion. His reply to charges that the
Birch Society was un-American it-
self is highly significant. The move-
ment to investigate the society, the
official said, “is a Communist-led
movement.”

That there is a strong Communist
organization in the U.S. is rather
certain. But the belief that some
25,000 registered communists, by
using the philosophy of the elite
corps, can multiply this small nu-
merical strength in a Leviathan is
rather improbable. Communism often
appeals to the intellectual and mal-
content, but the spread of commun-
ism also depends on poverty, not

Law Student
Takes Alaskan

 

By PAUL PLAWIN
Friday Staff Writer

As most Washington and Lee Uni-
versity students mapped plans for
the annual collegiate pilgrimage to

out for the Yukon.

school freshman from Norfolk, left
Lexington two weeks ago bound for
Alaska.

Lewis and his 19-year-old broth-
er Steve, a sophomore at Franklin
and Marshall College, pulled away
from Beker Dormitory at W&L be-
fore spring vacation in a foreign
compact car loaded down with fried
chickens, spare tires, snow shovels
and a pair of water wings.

“North to Alaska or Bust” read the
large white letters emblazoned
across the side of the car. “10,000
Miles, 10 Days, No Money!” read an-
other emblem.

They were to stay at the Univer-

expleined, “but if we find something
interesting up there we may stay
longer.” Neither of the brothers
has been to the 49th state before.

They hoped to average 1,000 miles
per day on their trek, making the
roundtrip in about 10 days.

“We plan to travel at a minimum
of expense,” Lewis said before leav-
ing, “a Goodrich dealer in Farmville
gave us a set of tires and the mer-
chants of Lexington and Lancaster,
Pa., have helped us out. The rest
is up to fate.”

The elder Lewis, who sports a
wild black beard that has earned
him the nickname “The Schweppes
Man” among his fellow students,
said he started planning the trip
about Thanksgiving time—when he
started the beard. His brother de-
cided to join him only a few weeks
ago.

As the two brothers prepared to
shove off on their cross-country
spring excursion, someone in a crowd
of well-wishers and hecklers yelled
out, “Are you going to get blind
dates up there?”

And the northbound collegians rolled
down the street with an arrow on
the roof of the car pointing north.

A ‘Do-It-Yourself’ Column For Our Readers;
Author Offers Subjects---You Do The Rest

By THORNS CRAVEN

Friday Columnist

Since we've all returned from
our glorious vacations, and all the
tales have been
told about them
by now, I’ve de-
cided to forego
any mention of
the week past, in
this week’s col-
umn. And I have
decided not to
make any mention
of my trip to New
York since my
parents are faith-
ful subseribers to
(It does make a good

 

this paper.
story though, and I’m having pri-

vate readings of my experiences
every Monday, Wednesday, and Fri-
day at five-thirty—this time is
chosen out of respect for the old
Lone Ranger radio program—so
come if you can, and if you can’t
then that’s your problem.)

And since neither my vacation,

 

nor yours, seems destined, or doom-
ed as the case may be, to make this
issue of our illustrious paper, there’s
not much left to say. The Tuesday
Edition was discourteous enough not
to be published this week, and
therefore I am left without subject
matter, and you are left without
anything to joke about. It almost
makes you sad that the Southern
Collegian doesn’t come out during
vacation.

But all this rambling gets us no-
where, and so what I propose to
do is go through the list of sub-
jects that I had thought of for this
week, put down the titles, and
then let all of you sit around and
write your own stories. Do so in 25
words or less, make up a nom-de-
plume, and you can win the Mahan
Award (first prize is two weeks
tuition or a glimpse at all the
lecture notes in the English depart-
ment, keeping all the Confederate
money you find). And so, fellow

 

1

creative writers, here are the sub-
jects:

This first one will naturally be
the most intriguing, and possibly
the least rewarding, so watch your
step.

In less than 651 names, write a
damning social treatise on some top-
ic, using the following title: “Dick
Litkenhaus Goes to College, or, He
Was Neither Here Nor There.”
Make sure that each word is care-
fully footnoted, giving Webster’s
International (or some other refer-
ence work with as good a name)
full credit for your vocabulary.

The pledge of the month is “On
my honor I have neither given nor
received aid on this paper, and al-
though I charged it at the Book
Shop I will pay the bill within three
months.”

 

2. This subject is also sticky:
“What I Did on My Vacation.” If |

you have a leaning toward humor |
then you might use John F. Ken-'

ib

nedy as your pseudonymn. If your
talent is on the serious side, then
you might look up the name of
the Ft. Lauderdale Chief of Police.

You could apply the prize money
to your bail. And if you’re not in
jail, but back on campus, you could

Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for the spring ,

An alumnus of Washington and
Lee has presented the University
with a completely documented and
authenticated 161-year-old antique.

Duncan G. Groner, a member of
a stock broking firm, has given the
University a clock made at the turn
of the nineteenth century in Han-
over, Mass.

The history of the clock can be
traced back to its creation in 1799 or
early 1800 by John Bailey, Jr. a
clock maker and noted inventor.

Bailey is also credited with the |
| invention of a steam-driven roasting
jack and the development of a
spinning jenny which was used by
many New England textile mills.

Has Various Dials

The clock, an eight-day weight
driven instrument, is complete with
a day-of-the-month and a moon
phase indicator. It is cased in the
Sheraton style. Notable variants,
however, are twist carved columns
on the hood and quarter columns
between the chest and hood. Brass
finals and eagle and ball decora-
tions are original.

On the dial is painted the legend
“warranted by J. Bailey for Joseph
G. Rea.” And a recent cleaning,

back of the dial—“John W. Bailey,
Hanover, Mass.”

The clock was made for Joseph
Rea of Boston. About 1802 he moved
to North Carolina and took the clock
with him. Since then, it has been in
the Rea family until it came to
Groner through his grandmother.

Placed in Washington Hall

The clock is now located in the
Deans’ Offices on the second floor of
Washington Hall.

Groner attended the university
from 1931 until 1935. In expressing
his thanks for the gift, Dean Frank
J. Gilliam said, “Mr. Groner has
been a loyal and interested alum-
nus.”

GENERALS WIN SECOND IN ROW

 

Roy Carpenter Massacres Indians With Arm, Bat, 6-4

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Sports Editor

Roy Carpenter used a strong arm
and a heavy bat to decision William
and Mary for the first time in five
tries Thursday at Williamsburg.

The smart righthander not only
held the Indians to four hits in an
eight-inning relief chore but also
slapped a two-run double in the
top of the 13th to give the Gen-
erals a 6-4 win.

Chuck Lane opened the fateful

 

13th with a single to right center.
Ned Hobbs walked then Carpenter,
who carried an .000 batting aver-
age into the game, lashed a double
to center to drive in Lane and
Hobbs.

William and Mary jumped on
starter Brice Gamber for a quick
3-0 lead.

But the Generals, led by the time-
ly hitting of third baseman Lane,
rallied to tie the score in the
seventh and go ahead, 4-3 in the

 

eighth.

Lane’s sharp single to left plated
Buck Rose, who had walked, with
the go-ahead run.

Rose and Bob Williams helped
insure the Generals win with out-
standing defensive plays. Rose ex-
ecuted a double play in the third
when he snared Bob Stoy’s drive
to right and nipped Dick Coyce,
who was trying to advance to third.

Williams made another of his
pateneted one-hand catches to rob

Wednesday Blues Hit WGL; Tennis,
Lacrosse Teams Fall To Red Raiders}

Wednesday was a blue day for Washington and Lee athletics as
Colgate University’s Red Raiders pounded the Generals’ lacrosse and

tennis teems

The Red Raider lacrosse team thumped Coach Bob McHenry’s
stickmen, 12-3, while at the same time the Colgate netters were

battering the W&L tennis team, 9-

0.

Colgate, on its annual spring tour to the South, opened a
quick 1-0 lead in the lacrosse game; but the Generals’ Ray
Miller tied the score with a 10-yard shot at 5:38 of the first
period. After that the Generals faded quickly

Rushing through the W&L defense like water through a sieve,
Colgate built up a 7-1 halftime lead. But the Generals still had a

chance.

That chance lasted exactly three minutes as the Red Raiders
filled the nets with four goals within 1:32 early in the third period.

John Paul opened the Colgate burst with a short center

 

Jay Wickel of a hit in the twelfth.
Williams nipped a Harvard threat
Monday with a one-handed catch.

The Indians tied the score with
two out in the ninth when Bob Irby Phil “Flip” Sharp did not have a

“Thank goodness we won't have*

other than Carpenter went to the
mound against them in the sixth
inning. Washington and Lee grab-
bed a 4-3 lead and held it until
the bottom of the ninth when Bob
Irby blasted a two-out homer to
tie the game.

William and Mary put runners on
base in the 10th, 11th, and 12th,
but Carpenter bore down each time

the W&L baseball team to a 6-0
victory over Harvard in the week’s
first top mound performance.

Sharp stopped Harvard on four
hits, struck out eight, and walked
only one. His only trouble spot was
the first when Harvard picked up
two of its four hits.

The Generals managed only four
hits off a pair of Harvard pitchers,
but used skillful base running, the
sacrifice, and four Harvard errors
to cement their first win in three
games.

Bob Williams got the Generals off
to a fast start in the second when
he stole home on the front of a
delayed double steal.

Ned Hobbs duplicated Williams’

At that moment Carpenter began
to wonder if the Indians still had

HAPPINESS CAN’T BUY MONEY

With tuition costs spiralling ever upward, more and more under-
graduates are investigating the student loan plan. If you are
one who is considering the “Learn Now, Pay Later’ system, you
would do well first to study the case of Leonid Sigafoos.
Leonid, the son of an upholsterer in Straitened Circum-
stances, Idaho, had his heart set on going to college, but his
father, alas, could not afiord to send him. Leonid applied for

a Regents Scholarship, but his reading speed, alas, was not
very rapid —two words an hour—and before he could finish the
first page of his test the Regents had closed their brief cases
crossly and gone home. Leonid then applied for an athletic
scholarship, but he had, alas, only a single athletic skill—
balancing a stick on his chin—and this, alas, aroused only
passing enthusiasm among the coaches.

 

 

And then, huzzah, Leonid learned of the student loan plan:
he could borrow money for his tuition and repay it in easy
monthly installments after he left school!

Happily Leonid enrolled in the Southeastern Idaho College
of Woodpulp and Restoration Drama and happily began a
college career that grew more happy year by year. Indeed, it
became altogether ecstatic in his senior year because Leonid met
a coed named Salina T. Nem with hair like beaten gold and
eyes like two squirts of Lake Louise. Love gripped them in its
big moist palm and they were betrothed on the Eve of St. Agnes.

Happily they made plans to be married the day after com-

mencement—plans, alas, that never were to come to fruition
because Leonid, alas, learned that Salina, like himself, was in
college on a stude nt loan, which meant that he had not only
to repay his own loan when he left school but also Salina’s, and
the job, alas, that was waiting for Leonid after graduation at

the Boise Raccoon Works simply did not pay enough, alas, to
cover both their loans, plus rent and food and clothing.

Sick at heart, Leonid and Salina sat down and lit Marlboro
Cigarettes and tried to find an answer to their problem—and,
sure enough, they did! I do not know whether or not Marlboro
Cigarettes helped them find an answer; all I know is that
Marlboros taste good and look good, and when things close in
and a feller needs afriend and the world is black as the pit from
pole to pole, it is a heap of comfort and satisfaction to be sure
that Marlboros will always provide the same unflagging pleas-
ure, the same unstinting quality, in all times and climes and
conditions. That's all I know.

Leonid and Salina, I say, did find an answer—a very simple
one. If their student loans did not come due until they left
school, why, then they just wouldn’t leave school! So after

receiving their bachelor degrees, they re-enrolled and took
masters degrees. After that they took doctors degrees, loads and
loads of them, until today Leonid and Salina, both aged 78, both

still in school, hold doctorates in Philosophy, Humane Letters

Jurisprudence, Veterinary Medicine, Civil Engineering, Op-
tometry, and Dewey Decimals. Their student loans, as of last
January 1, amounted to a combined total of eighteen million
dollars, a sum which they probably would have found great

difficulty in repaying had not the Department of the Interior
recently declared them a National Park.

© 1961 Max Shulman
* * *

You don’t need a student loan—just a little loose change—
to grab yourself a new kind of smoking pleasure from the
makers of Marlboro—the unfiltered king-size Philip Morris
Commander. Welcome aboard!

order in the bottom of the 13th to

For the first time in his college
career, Carpenter had beaten Wil-

Roy was glad, but what about

audience participation I thought it
best to start the new half-semester

McPherson Will Lecture
In duPont Hall Tonight

The General Counsel for the Dem-
ocratic Platform Committee will
speak tonight on “Regionalism and
National Interest.” The talk is
scheduled for 8:15 in duPont Audi-
torium.

Dr. Harry McPherson’s activities
for the Democratic Party keep him
busy with conferences with Vice
President Lyndon Johnson and con-
stantly on the floor of the Senate
with Sen. Mike Mansfield, the ma-

jority leader. He was also active
throughout the 1960 presidential
campaign.

Prior to assuming his duties as
counsel, Dr. McPherson was asso-
ciated with the University of Texas
law school. One of his_ special
interests has been regionalism,
along with the political scene.

While in Lexington, Dr. McPher-
son will appear in several classes and
will be a guest of Dr. Marshall Fish-
wick, professor of American Studies.

home as Roy Carpenter dashed to-
ward second.

In the third, singles by Chuck
Lane and Williams, a walk, and a
throwing error plated two runs for
the Generals.

W&L rounded out its scoring in
the sixth when Robin Wood scored
on Lane’s sacrifice and Lane, who
was safe on an error, tallied on
Hobbs’ deep fly to left.

Williams turned in the day’s best
defensive play when he _ robbed
Harvard’s Mike Drummey of an
extra-base hit in the seventh. Wil-

the hard-hit ball in the webbing of
his glove in deep left center.
