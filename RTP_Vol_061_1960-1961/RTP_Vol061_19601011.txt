University Party Names Ed Croft For Frosh EC

Ww

Danzansky Again To Direct S

KA Pledge To

Election To Be Held October 17

Ed Croft, a KA pledge from Atlanta, Ga., was nomi-
nated last night by the University Party for the post of Execu-
tive Committeeman representative from the freshman class.

The University Party candidate was named by freshman
political representatives from the ten member houses of the

“big clique” at a meeting held at the*
Phi Delt house.

Eight men were submitted for
nomination, but Croft’s candidacy
was endorsed by the two repre-
sentative of the party houses at
the meeting conducted by the
elected freshman chairman, Buck
Ogilvie.

A graduate of Westminster School
in Atlanta, Ed served as president
of the Honor Council there. Dur-
ing his junior year, he served as
vice-president of his class.

In athletics, Ed poses an out-
standing record, having earned sev-
en letters. He served as co-captain
of the football and track teams. For
his sports activities, he received
four “most valuable player” awards
and state championship honors.

Some of his other activities, in-
clude participation in the Spanish
Club, the Key Club, and the Stu-
dent Council.

At W&L Croft has begun by serv-
ing as a member of the Ring-tum
Phi staff, president of his KA pledge
class and a member of the freshman
football team.

Croft's opponent is Bill Noell,
standard-bearer for the Indepen-
dent Party. Both Croft and Noell
will be formally nominated next
Monday night, Oct. 17, in Lee Chapel.
After the nomination, freshmen will
choose their representative by sec-
ret ballot.

University Party chairman, John
Farmer, said that the freshmen
showed excellent and mature judg-
ment in their choice of Croft. He
stated further that he believed that
Croft was the best man for the job
and that he hoped that the fresh-
men would weigh the qualifications
of the two candidates very careful-
ly.

Croft said that he was highly hon-
ored to have been chosen to repre-
sent the University Party and that
if he is elected, he will do all that
is within his power to uphold the
integrity of the honor system and
the Executive Committee of Wash-
ington and Lee.

 

Biggs, Fischel
At Trade Meet

Harold Fischel, PEP, and Huntley
Biggs, SAE, have been presented an
expense-paid trip to the 12th An-
nual Virginia World Trade Con-
ference. The two-day meeting will
be held in Roanoke this Thursday
and Friday, Oct. 13 and 14. Fischel
and Biggs, who were chosen as rep-
resentatives of W&L’s international
economics class, will be accompan-
ied by John McKenzie Gunn, Jr.,
assistant professor of economics and
political science.

The conference, sponsored by the
Virginia State Chamber of Com-
merce, annually invites two W&L
students and a professor to partici-
pate in the activities. A part of the
conference will be a student forum
on Friday afternoon at which rep-
resentatives from most Virginia
colleges and a few selected ones
from surrounding states will ask
questions of a panel of experts.

Guest speakers for the World Trade
Conference include Arthur H. Mot-
ley, President of the U. S. Chamber of
Commerce; C. S. Waugh, President
of the Export-Import Bank of Wash-
ington; and B. K. Nehru, Ambassador
from India.

Also on the program is a W&L
alumnus Verbon E. Kemp, presently
the Executive Secretary of the Vir-
ginia State Chamber of Commerce;

Alumnus Levy

Asks Questons —
On TV Debate

In the second debate between the

 

two presidential candidates, on last |
Friday evening, one of the four
newsmen putting questions to the |
candidates was a former editor of
the Ring-tum Phi, Harold R. “Bud” |
Levy, who graduated from Wash-|
ington and Lee in 1942. |

Mr. Levy, now associated with |
the Long Island newspaper, News-
day, represented the press in a pan-
el of four questioners, two of whom
were from radio networks and two
from newspapers.

Mr. Levy attended Washington
and Lee from 1938 to 1942. He
graduated with a Bachelor of Arts
degree and a major in History.
While at W&L, in addition to serv-
ing as editor of the Ring-tum Phi,
Mr. Levy was president of his
social fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi,
president of the student publica-
tions board, a member of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, was on _ the
assimilation committee, a member
of Sigma Delta Chi, and of the
Cotillion Club, and is listed in
“Who’s Who in American Col-
leges and Universities.” He was
also on the Dean’s List.

After graduation in 1942, Mr. Levy
enlisted in the Infantry as a pri-
vate. He went to Officers School at
Ft. Benning and served for three
years in North Africa and Italy. He
was discharged in 1946 with the
rank of captain.

Mr. Levy, a native from New Jer-
sey, moved to North Carolina and
served on the staff of the Winston-
Salem Journal and Sentinel, first in
the position of telegraph editor and
later as Sunday Feature editor.

In 1953 Mr. Levy moved to Long
Island where he became Sunday
feature editor of Newsday. In 1955,
he became, in his present capacity,
head of Newsday’s Washington Bu-
reau, at the National Press Build-
ing.

 

A Tuesday staff meeting will be
held in the Student Union on Fri-
day, at 2 p.m.

Miss Moore Is Weekend Queen;
Rain Hurts Alumni Attendance

Miss Betsy Moore, representing
Kappa Sig, was crowned Homecom-
ing Queen in the climax of home-
coming festivities. Miss Moore, a
junior at Hollins, is five feet five
inches tall, has light blond hair and
blue eyes. She is a music major at
Hollins and a resident of Wilming-
ton, Del. Her escort was Skip Ruhle,
president of Kappa Sig.

Homecoming weekend began with
a pep rally Friday night in Doremus
Gym. Steve Danzansky, cheerleader
captain, introduced the homecoming
queen candidates and the new cheer-
leaders to an appreciative audience
of upperclassmen and pajama-clad
freshmen.

Coach Mac gave a short speech
which was warmly received by the
students. Courtney Mauzy introduced
the 1960 varsity football team. The
pep rally was followed by the tra-
ditional parade through the streets
of Lexington.

Phi Gam won first place in the
homecoming decorations contest
with their “Laundromat the Dip-
lopmat” display. It consisted of a
W&L General running a Diplomat
through the ringers of a giant
washing machine. Second place
went to SPE who centered their
display around Poor Richard's
Almanac. Delt, first place winners

Phi Gam also won the spirit trophy
for the second year in a row. The

Halftime entertainment was pro-
vided by the Franklin and Marshall
and the Halifax County High School
marching bands.

Three hundred and fifty grad-
uates from as far away as Cleve-
land, St. Louis, and New Orleans
signed the Alumni register. Satur-
day morning’s heavy downpour, it
is believed, kept away many alumni
from near-by areas.

Before the game, a luncheon was
held in the Evans Dining Hall for
all alumni and their wives. The
luncheon was preceded by a coffee
held in the foyer of the dining hall.
| The highlight of the day, of course,
was the smashing 38-8 victory over
Franklin and Marshall College. Af-
ter the game, an alumni reception
was held on the mezzanine of the

Congregationalist Dr. Nels F. S. Ferre

Dr. Nels F. S. Ferre of Andover
Newton Theological School will be
the main speaker for this years’
Religious Emphasis Week, Nov. 9-11.

Dr. Ferre, a Congergationalist,
will speak on the theme “Biblical
Faith and Modern Thought.” His
supporting speakers in the conference
will be Dr. David Wice, rabbi of
Congregational Rodeth Shalom in
Philadelphia, and Father Francis R.
McCarthy, pastor of St. Patrick’s
Catholic Church here in Lexington.

George Birdsong, chairman of
the University Religious Confer-
ence, says that the conference |
should create more interest and
participation than ever before, be- |
cause of three important reasons. |

The first of these changes is that
the speakers represent the Roman |
Catholic and Jewish faiths as well
as the Protestant, offering students
a new variety in points of view.

Also for the first time, informal
discussions with main speakers will |
be fitted into the week’s schedule. |
Dr. Ferre will deliver his lectures |

 

sions of them in afternoon sessions,
where students will have the chance
to ask him questions.

In addition, a series of prepara-
tory discussions will be given on
the three
nights before the conference be-
gins. These discussions are design-
ed to familiarize students with the
subject matter of the conference
and help them have a more alert
attitude toward the lectures.

The first of these discussions, deal-

| ing with Dr. Ferre’s first scheduled |

| lecture, “Contemporary Theology,” |
| will be held on Oct. 18, in the Stu-|
dent Union. The Rev. John

Memorial Episcopal Church, will! Dy, Wice will speak that night on |

Dr. Ferre will open the confer-
ence Wednesday morning, Nov, 9,
at 12:05, with his lecture on “Con-
temporary Theology.” The lecture
will be given in the Doremus Me-

Sophs To Apply
For SW MSFC

The Student War Memorial Schol-
arship Fund Committee will hold
interviews for perspective members
at 7 p.m. in the Student Union. Dave
Lefkowitz, chairman of the com-
mittee, has urged that sophomores,
regardless of fraternal or political
affiliation, should apply. Six new
members will be chosen.

The SWMSFC is an organized
committee which directs its efforts
towards raising funds for scholar-
ships for the sons of World War II
and the Korean War veterans. The
committee has raised funds to
provide a scholarship for at least
one boy. In the future it hopes
to provide many more scholar-
ships.

In the past the committee has
handled the senior ring sale, spring
musical, and the rental of caps and
gowns for graduation. It has also
been responsible for bringing the
Corn Bowl to W&L sports fans.

This years’ committee is now
seeking additional means to raise
money. The sophomore applicants
will be judged on their past records
and the impressions they leave with
the committee.

* Danzansky, a ZBT senior, is W&L’s
head cheerleader, a member of the
Concert Guild Board, and a Dean’s
List student. He has been active in
the Troubadour Theater and in Radio
Washington and Lee, in addition to
his services as a Ring-tum Phi
| columnist. His experience in dra-
matics includes work in summer
stock theaters and in many student
| productions, highlighted by “The
; Cannon’s Mouth” in 1960.
| Last summer Danzansky attended
Catholic University in Washington,
| where he took music composition
end theory courses in preparation
for writing the score of this year’s
show. The result of his summer’s
study is fifteen songs written ex-
pressly for the 1961 production. Com-
menting on the score of this year’s
musical, Danzansky said, “While ‘The
Cannon’s Mouth’ had only six or
seven melodies that could really be
called melodies, the 1961 show will
have fourteen or fifteen, about the
number in most Broadway musicals.”
Although the title of the musical
has not been released, Danzansky did
reveal the general nature and the
theme of the show. The plot will
be based on an old Greek comedy
by Aristophenes. Danzansky men-
tioned, “I’ve tried to adapt the old
Greek style of comedy to the modern
concept of humor without losing
too much of the play’s original flav-
or.” He added that the date for se-
lecting the cast and production crew
will be announced in the near fu-
ture.

Last year’s production of “The
Cannon’s Mouth” involved over 100
people in the cast, crew, and pro-
duction staff, making it the larg-
est single activity on the W&L
campus. An audience of over 1,000
contributed to SWMSFC by at-
tending the three-day run of the
show. A $200 donation was re-
ceived from an anonymous sup-
porter after seeing “The Cannon’s
Mouth.”

Danzansky gained national recog-
nition when Richard Coe, columnist
for the Washington Post, mentioned
his work in writing and directing
the musical.

Danzansky hopes to be able to use
girls again from the surrounding
women’s colleges in the cast of the
musical. A faculty member from
Sweet Briar mentioned that the
school was very pleased with the
production.

 

IFC Names Tom Edwards
Outstanding Freshman

Last night Dave Lefkowitz, pres-
ident of the IFC, announced that
Tommy Edwards of Phi Kappa Sig-
ma had been elected the “Outstand-
ing Freshman of the year 1959-1960.”

This honor was conferred upon
Edwards by a vote of the IFC com-
mittee because of his superior ac-
complishments in the previous year.

He became a member of Phi Eta
Sigma as a result of his 2.64 grade
ratio. He also played freshman foot-
ball and lettered in varsity track.

In the field of social activities, he
is a member of both the Glee Club
and the Dence Board. Last year he
was also a representative to the IFC,
and he is now president of the
Sophomore Class.

The runner-up in the IFC voting
was Meade Christian of Phi Gamma
Delta. This voting was extremely
close. Both Christian and Edwards
were outstanding in their achieve-
ments of scholastic and social nature.

Dave Lefkowitz said, “the com-
mittee had a hard choice to make.
However, Tommy was the most out-
standing freshman picked by the
IFC committee during the last sev-
eral years.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

Purpose?

In last Friday’s Ring-tum Phi there appeared an editorial en-
titled, “Is There Justification for ‘Honorary’ Abuse?” The log-
ical answer to this question is emphatically no! There is never
justification for misuse, mistreatment or abuse.

We frankly miss the point of the editorial. If it was to
inform the University community that “secret and nameless”
societies are or have been engaged in activities which violate
certain university ordinances, we feel that the charges might
have been a bit more specific. After all, if a society is secret
and/or nameless, it would seem that one would have to be a
member of that society to be completely familiar with its poli-

cies and its purposes.

This idea of purpose was also mentioned in the article in
question. We have never heard of, or seen, (nor are we able
to draw from the standing members) a statement of purpose
for the “nameless” and secret societies on campus.

We feel that the most important and most justifiable pur-

pose of all of these societies is
members. Their methods may
the same.

to furnish recreation for their
be different. Their purpose is

In saying this, we do not mean to condone any action that
violates a rule or policy of the University. We hope that those
“nameless” and secret societies who are engaged in such illicit
practices will use better judgment in the future. We feel that
most of the physical abuse has disappeared. (Where are the
PAN and White Friar paddles this year?)

We simply wish to defend the rights of these honorary so-
cieties to exist with no more definite purpose than to furnish

recreation for their members.

If this is not a valid purpose, we fear that our fraternities
would soon become eating clubs and the University would have
the problem of providing forms of social recreation for its stu-
dent body. We do not feel that the “academic and social ideal-
ism” of our university has been shattered by the appearance of

these societies.

With the exception of a few white hats and arm bands,
there has been little evidence of these societies on campus. The
academic pursuits of the members of these societies have cer-

tainly not been disrupted any more than those of the freshmen

fraternity pledges. We fail to see the social ideals that have been

shattered.

Congratulations!

Steve Danzansky and his staff of cheerleaders are to be con-
gratulated for their excellent show of effort and enthusiasm
during last week’s homecoming festivities. The cheer rally was
a success. There could and should have been more participation
on the part of the upper classes. We feel that Danzansky did
a wonderful job in getting the crowd out and in publicizing the

rally.

The cheerleaders did their best at the game. However, if it
had not been for the Fiji freshmen and a few old grads the
Washington and Lee contingent in the stands would have been
drowned out by the valiant little group in the F&M seats. Let’s
help the team and the cheerleaders out; let’s learn the cheers
and scream a little. It should not be below the dignity of even
a W&L gentleman to cheer for a winning team.

Do you suppose there would be any support for pep rallys
before all of our home games? We have heard a number of
the players say that it really “fired them up” to know that
so many people were interested.

We don’t pay them, but let’s support them!

 

This Is The Time For Greatness!
Congo Result Of Mismanagement

By HENRY HARRELL

Out of the depths of the Belgian
Congo, a noise, a stirring. Through
the shadows, dark figures glide sil-
ently with an occasion flash of metal
or gleam of pigment to reveal that
these are men and not animals. Sud-
denly two of these chocolate phan-
toms meet, stop, and recoil from
one another: “Are you a Lumumba
man?”

The brutal chatter of machine
gun fire shocks the jungle into
silence. One man falls dead—the
Mobutu man walks around him,
nervously glancing at the silent
jungle walls.

Meanwhile, back at the city—Pat-
rice Lumumba hysterically orders
immediate execution of all Mobutu
men, half of Kasavubu’s forces, and
total extermination in Katanga pro-
vince. The guards picking their teeth
at the doors look at him and laugh.
He rolls on the floor, kicking and
screaming, while the picture of
Khrushchev on the wall stares at
him accusingly.

In the stronghold on the hill,
President Kasavubu jumps and
turns as pale as he can when the
door behind him opens. But before
he squeals out anything in his
terror, he recognizes one of his
own men, In impeccable French,
his underling says:

“They want to know what you are

going to do about this mess, I mean.”
“Tell them I'll issue a statement

 

tomorrow or sometime. Tell them
anything.”

Young, bespeckled  strong-man
Mobutu relaxes at his ease in his
flat, only blocks from Lumumba’s
stronghold. He looks calm and in
control, and when a stone smashes
through his window, striking one of
his children (the child is not in-
jured, as it was hit on the head),
he barks out commands to the uni-
formed men surrounding him. They
run out to get the offender, but
soon come back empty-handed.

“He went past the end of the
block. Yessir, he did, and you told
us we don’t control past the end of
the block.”

Mobutu, a calmer man than Lu-
mumba, contents himself with chew-
ing up his cigar and eating it in im-
potent rage.

This is the Congo’s “time for
greatness,” a time for all her men
to aid their country. The Belgian
Congo wanted freedom, and fast.
They got it. And now the great
and glorious young messiahs of the
Congo, Kasavubu, Lumumba, and
Mobutu, must decide the destiny of
this new addition to the proud na-
tions of the world.

The Congo has presumably taken
her rightful place. Perhaps she will
come up with a plan for world dis-
armament—Kwame Nkrumah has
one. If we are really fortunate, one
day this new and sovereign nation,

Lyric to Continue Line of Good Shows

By GERRY OUELLETTE

We believe that contrast best serv-
es the cause of impartiality. There
has been, much without surprise to
us, a great deal of foul publicity for
the town of Lexington in the pages
of our newspaper. We must insist
that all facets be viewed before we
pronounce final judgment.

With the idea of equal praise for
bitter criticism, we have invited a
fellow student, Bond Johnson, to
evaluate the cinema situation in
Lexington. Mr. Johnson’s remarks,
we feel, bring out the best of what
has been shown and that which will
be shown at our very own Lyric
Theater.

a * *

No one can leave the Lyric
theater without noticing Mr. Side
standing by the door or at the pop-
corn counter talking with the stu-
dents. If the crowd is small, you
won't leave without being asked
by him what you thought of the
movie. Perhaps if you have talked
to Mr. Side before, he will ask
your advice on which films he
should bring. If you suggest one of
your old favorites to him and
enough people seem interested in
it, the chances are he will play it
before the end of the year.

As a result of his selection of
films, Mr. Side has given Lexington
a better art theater than most larger
cities have. The short runs he is
able to arrange allow a variety that
a bigger city may not have.

Last year he gave us “Wild Straw-
berries,” “The Seventh Seal,” and
“The Magician” within a period of
time that one Bergman film would
play in a large city.

Mr. Side’s program last year would
have been a credit to any art theat-
er. We saw four Bergman films, the

 

three above and “Smiles of a Sum-
mer Night.” In the way of old clas-
sics we had “The Private Life of
Henry VIII” and “Grand Illusion;”
not to mention Eisenstein’s monu-
mental “Potemkin,” perhaps the
most outstanding landmark in the
history of filming technique.

From England Mr. Side brought
“Room at the Top,” “Sapphire,” and
“Richard III.” From the old Holly-
wood repertory he got “Casablanca,”
“Gilda,” “Arsenic and Old Lace,” and
the Garland triumph, “A Star Is
Born.”

In the near future Mr. Side
will bring “Pather Panchali” and
“The Crucible.” “Pather Panchali”
is the first film in the new Indian
trilogy, “Aparagito.”

“Aparagito,” as a whole, has been
well received in New York, and the
first film, “Pather Panchali,” has
been the most highly praised of the
three. “The Crucible” portrays Jean
Paul Sartre’s French adaptation of
Arthur Miller’s play concerning
witchcraft in the Salem of 1692. Si-
mone Signoret of “Room at the Top”
plays opposite her husband, Yves
Montand.

Another certain engagement is
“Jazz on a Summer Day,” a study
in sounds and photography revolv-
ing around the 1959 Newport Jazz
Festival.

The Lyric’s list of tentative
bookings include some of the most
successful films in New York, as
well as some of the older Holly-
wood classics. From the former
we find “The 400 Blows,” a French
film that reveals the short career
of a twelve-year-old boy consid-
ered a delinquent who was looking
for nothing more than affection.

“Hiroshima, Mon Amour,” is an-
other French release of great in-
tegrity that explores the love of a
Frenchwoman for a Japanese. In-
herent in the theme of the doomed
affair is a poignant apology for
peace.

Having given us previously “The
Mouse That Roared” and “The Bat-
tle of the Sexes,” Mr. Side plans to
bring another of the Peter Seller’s
movies, “I’m All Right Jack.” This
time, Mr. Sellers depicts a shop
steward in an English plant where
nearly all the workers are lunatics.

“Sunset Boulevard,” a rerelease Mr.
Side is trying to get from Paramount
Pictures, is an early Billy Wilder
film with Gloria Swanson and Wil-
liam Holden. Gloria Swanson plays
a faded star of the pre-talkies who
sits in splendid decadence in her
palace on Sunset Boulevard. Wil-
liam Holden is the young writer
whom she traps to plan her come-
back.

William Holden is eventually de-
stroyed. She loses whatever contact
with reality she may have had as
she wonders, posing as if it were her
comeback among reporters who come
to her home as a result of Holden’s
death.

A Charlie Chaplin classic, “Mod-
ern Times,” may also be coming to
the Lyric screen. The last great sil-
ent film to be made, this 1936 sa-
tire comments on over mechan-
ization in the best Chaplin man-
ner.

“On the Waterfront,” the early
Brando film, is also on the list of
possibilities.

Lawrence Oliver’s “Henry V,” the
favorite of the English faculty, will
return this year. It is one of Oliver’s
most brilliant Shakespeare produc-
tion, and can never be seen enough.

 

Byrd Demo Reluctant To Join
With W&L Young Republicans

BY BILL ROBERTS

We struck a blow against apathy
last Tuesday and attended the
Young Republicans meeting up at
the Student Union. For someone
whose political views undergo fre-
quent sharp revisions, it was a big
move. and we did it with the under-
standing that we would remain Vir-
ginia Democrats for Nixon.

We are glad the meeting was at
night so we could slip in under cov-
er of darkness. When you have
wavering political ideas there’s no
point in alienating the other side.
You might be with them next month.
We were determined to be discreet.

So we walked timidly into
the Student Union, not to sure
what to expect. We found a table
covered with Nixon-Lodge liter-
ature and surrounded by a little
circle of beaming Nixon-Lodge
backers. We also found a beaming
faculty Republican who joined the
Young Republicans in welcoming
us to the fold.

We put on a little red, white and
blue badge proclaiming our prefer-
ence and began to feel a little more
at ease. Perhaps choosing sides
wasn’t too bad an idea after all.

The meeting began with a few
words by Dave Cook, the president,
on what they, oops, I mean we, are
up to. The Young Republicans plan
to work hard to get as many Wash-
ington and Lee students who are old
enough to vote for Nixon-Lodge
and to assist the Rockbridge County
Republicans in as many ways as pos-
sible.

Then a fellow we didn’t know told
about the meeting of all the Young
Republicans held in Charlottesville
the previous week. The Young Re-
publicans from the other schools
were glad to see W&L represented
at the meeting because W&L once
was a real force in Virginia Young
Republicans. W&L’s four represen-
tatives were able to outmaneuver
some larger delegations and were
quite a force at this meeting, we
were told.

The fellow we didn’t know went
on to say that Horace “Hunkie”
Henderson had made a very im-
pressive speech to the Young Re-
publicans at Charlottesville. Mr.
Henderson ran on the Republican
ticket for Congress and for Lieu-
tenant Governor in Virginia. He
put up a good although losing fight
and was rewarded with a job in
Washington.

Mr. Henderson had given pause to
our delegate by revealing that Vir-
ginia has one of the strongest po-
litical machines in the country. We
leaned back our chair, quite proud
of Mr. Byrd and his machine. But
the fellow we didn’t know was hor-
rified and implied that it was our
bounden duty to do _ everything

symbol of nationalism and equality| within our power to hasten the

(Continued on page 4)

breakup of the Byrd machine.

 

We didn’t take too kindly to that
part of our duty but reasoned ma-
turely that remarks of this sort were
a necessary consequence of choosing
sides.

The head of the local Republi-
cans, who was going to brief us on
what we could do in the County
campaign, didn’t show.

The meeting closed with a series
of short pep talks by some of the
leading Young Republicans. We got
pretty fired up.

We went out all aglow and jeered
at the Young Democrats, who were
rallying for a meeting. We were sad
to see, however, that there were five
or six more Young Democrats gath-
ered there than Young Republicans.

The next morning Dr. Jenks asked
if anyone in 9:20 French Revolution
had been to the Young Republican
meeting. We tentatively affirmed we
had. Did we have any Nixon-Lodge
bumper stickers? We did indeed.
“Well,” said Dr. Jenks, “someone
put one on my car last night and
my wife’s working on it with a razor
blade now.” We promise you we
didn’t do it, Dr. Jenks—the pep
talks weren’t that good. It was prob-
ably an anarchist.

 

Deferred Rush To Begin;
IFC President Recalls Rules

By HAL McCLANAHAN

Friday, Oct. 14 is the official date
for the beginning of deferred rush.
Those 76 freshmen who did not
pledge a fraternity during the formal
rush in September may now do so.

By not pledging a fraternity in the
regular rush period, the 76 members
of the Class of 1964 halted a grow-
ing four-year trend in increasing
fraternity enrollment. According to
Dean Frank J. Gilliam, about 15 of
those 57 boys in deferred rush last
year pledged fraternities after the
four-week interm between Septem-
ber rush and deferred rush.

The term “deferred rush,” simp-
ly means that starting this com-
ing Friday and running until the
end of their senior year, those
freshmen who did not pledge a
fraternity during the formal rush
may do so if they wish.

There are two main rules govern-
ing deferred rush. First a freshman
is free to go to the various frater-
nities he wishes to see; and the fra-
ternities, in turn, may invite the
freshman over to see them. A fresh-
man may have dinner with the fra-
ternity, or he may attend the various
social functions. The second rule
concerning deferred rush is the
pledging. The fraternity may extend
a bid to the freshman at its dis-
cretion, The freshman may either
accept the bid then or give the fra-
ternity his answer at another time.

Impressions Of
Weekend Blast

By ED WEBSTER

Random impressions of Home-
coming weekend:

... The unflagging labor Thursday
and Friday to construct the dis-
plays. Books were forgotten for the
sake of these monsters, who were
conceived through a blend of elbow
grease and midnight oil, and who
grew to maturity by devouring box-
es of Kleenex...

... Delight at Friday’s blue skies,
turning to dismay at Saturday’s gray-
ness. But the gods, not unmindful
of the Minks, did turn off the rain
long enough to give the home folks
an enjoyable Saturday afternoon...

...My sense of futility as the
Wilson Field ticket-taker demand-
ed two handsome dollar bills so
my date could watch the game.
Maybe the University is trying to
push big-time box office, even
though big-time football is ex-
tinet....

... The red-vested idiot two rows
behind us who snarled, “Sit down,
it’s only a touchdown.” May his tribe
vanish from our fair campus....

...Our delight at some sterling
plays, done perfectly depite the mud.
The first quick kick, for instance, or
that blocked punt-touchdown com-
bination. ....

...-The quadrupling of the
Homecoming atmospere by our
cheerleaders and the three
bands....

... The premature (and unmourn-
ed) death of the Mongolian Minks’
and Thirteen Club’s annual halftime
fiasco....

... Sitting in the Lobby at Sem
for an hour Sunday afternoon,
soaking up the Victorian grotes-
ness of the place. Also noticing all
the warden-ladies’ efforts to keep
the girls from doing anything un-
seemly, I still fear that the girls

One of our English professors has
seen “Henry V” more times than
we are years old.

The schedule may include two
Bergman movies. The earlier Berg-
man films have enjoyed quite a
vogue with the New Yorkers.
One of the spiciest, “Lesson in
Love,” which deals with the pri-
vate affairs of a doctor centers on
a bet of love. We hope for this
one.

“Rosemary,” another hopeful, in-
volves a bunch of Nazi nouveaux-
riches who have a common interest
in a common but clever young trol-
lop. Nadja Tiller, as the inspiring
tart, eventually winds up dead.

The engagements of many of these
programs are still tentative. With
the vital place that films occupy
in the art world, they should find no
lack of support around a college
town. Mr. Side’s decision on many
of these films will depend to a large
degree on student affirmation and
support. With such an exciting pro-
gram, this should be no problem.

Columnist Asks
Aid To Alumni

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

After Homecomings and the num-
ber of alumni who did come home,
the university or the Alumni Asso-
ciation should start to think about
building or buying an Alumni Hall
or some similar sort of place to
which returning alumni could go.
As it is now, alumni usually gravi-
tate to their respective fraternity
houses, and then, when things get
too bad, back to the hotel room.
This means that any homecomings
or other alumni gathering is a frac-
tional thing, and classmates only
meet haphazardly, which mars the
effect of a Homecomings.

 

The alumni, especially those who
are past the point of having friends
in school, need a place at which they
can meet, a focal point, as it were.
This would result in attracting more
alumni back, not only for Home-
comings, but other important week-
ends. That in turn would increase
interest in the school and make
alumni fund raising much easier. The
plain fact of the matter is, though,
that they should have some other
place besides the well-worn mezza-
nine of the Robert E. Lee in which

to meet.
* * *

Recent commentaries on the “hon-
orary organizations” have been ex-
tremely interesting, indicative of
what might be termed in this aca-
demic world “The new Functional-
ism.” “If it serves no useful purpose,
throw it out.” This is all very well,
but who is to apply the test of use-
fulness? What will the standards be?

PAN, White Friars, Sigma, “13”
(to none of which your correspon-
dent belongs) are all essentially
harmless and all emphatically vol-
untary. They may neither sow nor
reap, but that shouldn’t concern any-
one so long as they don’t disgrace
the university. You may talk of
twentieth century colleges, but the
twentieth century isn’t so damned
distinguished that it can’t tolerate
a few harmless organizations. The
crux of the issue lies in the fact
that these societies serve no purpose
discernible to the critics. These crit-
ie probably want to see the student
body organized and aimed at pur-
poses of their choosing. It is their
answer to the “National Purpose”
articles which ran recently in a
popular magazine of immense circu-
lation. Why must everything serve
a purpose?

Using the same reasoning, a vigor-
ous attack could be made on the
whole system of conventional dress.
Men are forced to wear coat and tie
to no real purpose when khakis and
sweaters would answer as well to
hide their nakedness and_ protect
them from the cold. For another ex-
ample, beanies are a real hang-over
from the nineteenth century, design-
ed expressly to make the wearer
look foolish. If freshmen have to be
identified, surely there is some more
civilized way of doing it. The very
word beanie brings to mind those
horrible juvenile capers and shouts
of “Hey, frosh!” in Hollywood’s col-
lege movies. These things are indeed
purposeless and involuntary.

Let things be.

A word about Steve Allen. Allen,
a singer of a recent advertisement
for the Committee for a Sane Nuclear
Policy and a member of that commit-
tee, demonstrated this weekend his
moral and artistic integrity in a
movie called “College Confidential.”
Hollywood demonstrated, for those
of us who had forgotten, its ability to
out-do television without really even
trying.

W&L Downs Diplomats, 38-8

5-Star Generals Defeat F&M
Before Big Homecoming Crowd

By JOHN DEAN

Washington and Lee’s Generals
played nearly perfect football on
in
routing Franklin and Marshall, 38-

Wilson Field here Saturday

8.

The unbeaten Generals came up
to their potential for the first time
this season in spite of a wet field.
Fortunately a steady morning drizzle
quit just before the kickoff be-

fore 3,500 homecoming fans.

Coach Lee McLaughlin’s charges
rolled up 496 yards total offense
while piling up 24 first downs.
Meanwhile, the General defense
confined F&M to only 173 total
yards and 9 first downs.

The Generals’ first score was made
with seven and a half minutes re-
maining in the first period. W&L took
the opening kick-off and marched
79 yards with Bob Funkhouser
slipping over for the goal for a 6-0

lead.

W&L’s second score came in the
second quarter after a clipping
penalty had nullified a touchdown
by Steve Suttle. With the ball on
the F&M 26, Doug Martin rushed
off tackle and went all the way
for the score. Suttle then ran for

2 points making the score 14-0.

The Generals made it 22-0 about
five minutes later after driving 77
yards. A 15 yard run by Funkhouser
and a 32 yard pass from Suttle to
Hobbs put the ball on the Diplomats
26. Martin picked up a first down on
the three. Funkhouser scored and

Martin ran for the two points.

The Diplomats’ initial first down
came late in the second period
when John Tomasko returned a
50 yard quick kick by Martin to
the W&L 48. This drive was stalled
as the quarter ended.

W&L increased its lead to 30-0
early in the third quarter when Ned
Hobbs blocked an F&M punt, picked
up the loose ball on the two and

ran
(Continued on page 4)

 

it over for the touchdown.

And Assesses

The performance of our Generals |
was gratifying. There were heroes |
aplenty, but again it was a squad vic- |
tory with each player contributing
his part to win.

Doug Martin and Bobby Funk-
houser will be the first to tell you
that running through a line can be
very difficult unless there is block-
ing. The boys up front deserve a
great deal of credit for the win.

Barton Dick is my choice for the
unsung hero of the game. Barton,
who played mostly on defense, had |
the assignment of containing Frank-
lin and Marshall’s fine running back
John Tomasko. John only made one
long run, and this was while Barton
was on the sidelines. John caught a
touchdown pass but this was not in
Barton’s department.

You may not believe this but
Coach Williams saw Randolph-
Macon lose on the last play of
their game with Western Maryland.
It was just a week earlier that
he had seen Franklin and Marshall
lose to Johns Hopkins on the last
play of the game.

Martin Is Selected
Player of the Week

A great deal of credit for our
victory over the Diplomats of Frank-
lin and Marshall last Saturday can
be attributed to Doug Martin, the
159-pound fullback. His top-notch
running and kicking in the Home-
comings game has earned him the
title of this week’s player-of-the
week.

Doug, a junior from Ft. Thomas,
Ky., reeled off 172 yards rushing
on 13 carries, including his two
touchdown rushes of 26 and 58
yards. This is compared to his
record last year for 27 runs for a
total of 104 yards rushing.

In Saturday’s game Doug scored
two of the Blue and White’s five
touchdowns and two extra points.
In addition to his ground game, there
is his kicking record for the after-

Town police have arrested a

pocketbooks and money from sev-

night.

According to Police Chief A. E.
Rhodenizer, the boy was appre-
hended about 1:30 a.m. Sunday.
In his possession were three pock-
etbooks and $44 in cash.

Rhodenizer said the boy also
showed the police where he had
thrown other pocketbooks into
hedges.

The boy admitted visiting the
Phi Kap, KA, Delt and Phi Gam
houses, the chief said.

“We believe there were three
or four other boys involved,”
Rhodenizer added.

He urged students to inquire at
the police station if their dates lost
pocketbooks over the weekend.

He also warned fraternity men
to be wary of non-students visit-
ing their houses on weekends.

F&M’s Gebbard punted out of
bounds on the W&L 15. On the first
play, Martin broke through tackle

touchdown. Quarterback Chuck
Lane ran the extra points to make

noon. Both of his quick kicks for
61 and 58 yards caught the Diplo-
mats by surprise and helped to keep
the Franklin and Marshall crew on
the defensive.

Coach McLaughlin feels that
Martin’s performance was excel-
lent and that he will continue to
be a valuable member of the team.

It should be noted that Doug was
particularly “up” for this game be-
cause last year at Lancaster when
the Generals played the Diplomats,
he was injured on the second play
of the game. This year he was seek-
ing his revenge and from the final
score it seems that he was success-
ful.
