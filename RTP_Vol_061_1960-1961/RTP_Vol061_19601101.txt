Vice President Nixon Sweeps Campus Election

Both Faculty And Student Votes;

Favor Republican Party Nominees

By BOB BRIDEWELL

The Washington and Lee student
body, faculty, and administration
joined hands yesterday in endors-
ing the Republican ticket for 1960.
Sixty-three per cent of the total
votes cast were for Richard Nixon
and Henry Cabot Lodge, 36 per cent
cast their lot with the Kennedy-
Johnson team, and one per cent
chose to write in their choice for
chief executive.

The students, as was expected, led
the Republican bandwagon, voting
75 per cent for the Nixon-Lodge
combination, but the real surprise
to most came from the faculty and

administration. While most observers
had predicted a Kennedy victory
from these groups, the voters them-
selves proved them wrong, as the

 

final faculty and administration count
showed 46 votes for Nixon compared
to 44 for Kennedy.

Dave Goller, Director of Home
Edition, the co-sponsor of the
Presidential Election along with
Sigma Delta Chi, stated that the
total student turnout comprised
only 47.92 per cent of the eligible
voters, a number well below the
national average. The freshman
class showed the lowest percentage
turnout, with only 40 per cent vot-
ing, while the senior class led all
students with a 57 per cent turn-
out. Sixty-eight and 92 hundredths
per cent of the faculty and admin-
istration cast their ballots in the
election.

Goller said, “I believe that the ad-
ministrative personnel probably car-
ried the faculty and administration
for Nixon, plus the fact that sev-
veral avowed Kennedy supporters
failed to vote. Even if the admin-

istration had not carried the vote|

for Nixon, it would have been
close, which is surprising to me in
view of the strong Kennedy voices
heard recently in the faculty.”

The Mock election gained the in-
terest of newspapers throughout the
state, with news services in Roa-
noke, Lynchburg, and Richmond re-
questing information. Both the AP
and UPI wires transmitted the re-
sults of the poll throughout the area.

Princeton recently held a similar
mock election, with the following
results: Students—8 to 1 for Nixon;
Faculty “overwhelmingly” for
for Kennedy.

Of the five write-in ballots, one
was for Byrd, one for Talmadge, one
for Goldwater, one for Homer A.
Tomlinson, and one for T. Coleman
Andrews.

 

Freshmen, Eberle Draw Crowds
Despite House Competition

The Four Freshmen were the hit
of Openings Weekend. This can best
be shown by the large crowd pres-
ent at the Saturday night dance to
hear them repeat their musical suc-
cesses of the afternoon concert. The
Saturday night affair has drawn only
sparse crowds at best in the recent
dance sets, but this occasion found
the gym floor packed despite the
“No Smoking, No Drinking” rule and
the competition of fraternity house
combos. Jimmy Vann, president of
the University Dance Board, was all
smiles when he said, “This is as
good a crowd as I ever hope to see
at a Dance Set.” Ray Eberle pro-
vided some very danceable sounds,
but the Four Freshmen’s renditions
of such tunes as “Day by Day” and
“In the Still of the Night” made the
evening musically memorable.

 

While the Four Freshmen and Ray
Eberle were holding forth in the
center ring, combos were performing
on either side. There were a few
side shows, but the majority of the
house parties provided good enter-
tainment. Friday afternoon found
TNT Tribble playing to an enthusias-
tic crowd at the cocktail party given
by the Betas for Dance Set President
Pearce Hardwick. Another popular
group new to the W&L campus was
the Delicados. Such old favorites as
The Little Boys, Piano Red, and the
Jivers could also be heard sound-
ing forth at all hours of the day
and night during the weekend’s fes-
tivities. Friday night’s dance was also
well attended,

Credit for the excellent dance set
goes to Pearce Hardwick and St.
James of the House of Vann.

Hadas On Classics And Moderns:

‘Greeks Were Great, So Are We’

By STEVE HENRY

Dr. Moses Hadas, Jay Professor
of Greek at Columbia University,
opened the 35th Washington and Lee
Seminar in Literature before a
packed house in duPont Auditorium
here last ngiht, praising a 20th cen-
tury generation for producing a so-
ciety equally as brilliant as that
of the Greeks.

“Our generation’s got nothing to
be ashamed of,” said Dr. Hadas.
“Why should we run ourselves down
in useless comparisons with the
Greeks?”

He cited the 20th century as an
extraordinary example of man’s
ability to gain control over the
physical universe and his own
environment.

“T owe a lot to the Greeks,” he
said. “I’ve gotten my bread and but-
ter from them for a long time. But
our generation has produced an age
just as great.”

“Centuries from now, we will be
looked on as a remarkable civiliza-
tion,” he commented.

“There is no denying our debt to
the Greeks, but we are still of our
own making.”

These were unexpected words
from a man introduced as “the dean
of classical study in America.”

The audience seemed ready to
listen to a dyed-in-the-wool classic-
ist deride our own civilization and
offer up highest praise for the Greek
way of life.

But Dr. Hadas said at the outset

 

that he was no self-styled “evangel-
ist of the Olympians.”

His hour-long lecture, entitled
“Humanism, the Ancient Ideal and
Its Survival,” touched on a wide
range of subjects.

Dr. Hadas never put either classi-
cism or humanism on a _ pedestal,
however.

He gave no specific definition of
Humanism, saying that it was too
closely associated with everything—
politics, religion, ete—to be de-
fined.

“Anyone speaking on the sub-
ject of Humanism should be sus-
pected at once,” he said. “The
term can denote almost anything.
For the Greeks, the measure of
Humanism was the man, the indi-
vidual.”

“Man was preoccupied with his
own importance, but importance to
the Greek meant that the individual
should excell, both for himself and
also for the state.”

“The big thing for a Greek was to
have his name remembered as hav-
ing done something to further the
cause of his people or his country.
Achilles is a perfect example.”

And Dr. Hadas went on to ex-
plain the Greek conception of a
hero, using characters from classic
tragedy and epic literature.

“We have to take Greek heroes
at face value. These men accom-
plished what they did as a result

Local Women Lead In Troub Play

By HENRY M. STROUSS
Troub Publicity Director

The Troubadour Theatre of Wash-
ington and Lee University has been
fortunate to secure the services of
three talented and experienced act-
resses to fill the female roles in their
production of Fry’s “The Lady’s
Not for Burning,” to be presented
in November.

Playing the title role will be Miss
Margaret Davis. Miss Davis began
her acting career acting in numerous
productions at King’s Hall, Compton,
Quebec. Continuing her education in
England, she had the opportunity to
frequently attended performances of
the London stage.

A distinct accent marks Miss
Davis’ Canadian and British back-
ground. This pleasant quality
makes her voice especially well-
suited for the poetic passages she
must negotiate in “The Lady’s Not
for Burning.”

The major development of Miss
Davis’ acting talent has taken place
in Lexington in her work for the
Troubadour Theatre. Under the skill-
ful guidance of former Troub di-
rector Lloyd Jackson Lanich, she
performed roles in “Witness for the

 

Prosecution,” “Twelfth Night,” and
numerous other productions. She
has won acclaim and admiration from
Lexington audiences for her artistic
distinction.

The feaured actresses in “The
Lady’s Not for Burning” are Yvonne
Dickins and Lisa Tracy.

Mrs. Dickins, wife of Dr. David
Dickins of the Washington and Lee
German Department, is appearing
in the cast of this season’s first play.
She is currently teaching English
and French at Lexington High
School and is the director of the
Teenactors organization there.

 

The family of Col. M. W. Tracy has |

been active in the Troubadour|
Theatre for many years. Originally |
Mrs. Tracy assisted the group, then |
her daughter Jeanne, now studying |
the drama in Germany on a Ful-|

bright Scholarship, participated. Now | ®

Col. Tracy’s youngest daughter steps
into the spotlight.

In last season’s “The Skin of Our |
Teeth,” Lisa held a small role, but

she is undertaking the secondary
romantic lead. In addition to her

pated in productions by the Lexing-| Lisa Tracy (left), Yvonne Dickins and Margaret Davis rehearse for “The

Toynbee To Talk Here March 10:

‘Does History Make Sense?’

By TOM LYBASS

Dr. Arnold Toynbee, the most dis-
tinguished historian of modern times,
will discuss the question: “Does
history make sense?” in a lecture
that will be presented on Friday,
March 10, at 8:00 p.m. in Doremus
Gymnasium.

The entire student body is invited

to attend the lecture which is spon- ©

  

sored by the University Lecture

Committee of which Dr. Allen Moger
is Chairman.

Dr. Toynbee, who was a visiting
professor at W&L four years ago, is
well known to Lexingtonians, many
of whom are his personal friends.
During his three day stay in Lex-
ington, he will be the guest of Dr.
and Mrs. Edward D. Myers.

Arnold Toynbee is the author of
300 books and articles in English,
the chief and most famous of which
is the monumental Study of History.
The eleventh and final volume of

The Study was written in collabor-*

ation with Dr. Edward D. Myers,
well-known member of the W&L

faculty.
Now in his seventy-second year,
Toynbee served as Director of

Studies at the Royal Institute of
International Affairs. While acting
in this position, he also served as
editor of “The Annual Survey of
International Affairs.”

After retiring four years ago, the
noted historian began an 18-month
trip around the world. Four of those
months were spent in India, Parkis-
tan, and Afghanistan. Last spring,
Dr. Toynbee gave a series of lectures
in Germany and at Rome and Bolog-
na in Italy, after which he and Dr.
Myers made a study tour of the
island of Sicily. During the coming
second semester, Toynbee will lecture
at the University of Pennsylvania.

His lecture at W&L is expected to
attract many people from surround-
ing areas.

 

Father McCarthey Speaks
Religious Emphasis Week

Father Francis R. McCarthy, pas-
tor of St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic
Church here in Lexington, will be
a supporting speaker for Religious
Emphasis Week, Nov. 9-11. He will
conduct an open discussion on “Re-
ligion and the East-West Conflict” on
Wednesday evening, Nov. 9, and a
discussion on “Religion and Racial
Exclusiveness” Thursday evening,
Nov. 10.

Father McCarthy has been in his
present position at St. Patrick’s since
last June, coming from Dayton,
Ohio where he had done some par-
ish work. A native of Hartford, Conn.,
he graduated from St. Joseph’s Col-
lege in Renssalaer, Indiana, in 1936.
After receiving his A.B. degree there,
he went to the University of Indiana
and earned a Master’s degree in Eng-
lish there. He was ordained at St.
Charles Seminary in Ohio in 1942,
and then went back to St. Joseph’s
to teach for several years.

Local Grotto
Spelunkers Host
Regional Society

The Lexington Grotto will play
host this weekend to the Virginia
Regional Meeting of the National
Speleological Society. The conven-
tion plans to attract the top “cave-
hounds” in the state as well as those
groups active in the Washington,
D.C. area. At least five prominent
cavers have promised to present
lectures on their specialized work in
fields ranging from rapelling to geo-
logical formations.

Three-day Convention

The three-day convention will
consist mainly of films, slides, lec-
tures, and demonstrations, although
the Lexington Grotto has planned
a series of field trips to some of the
more than one-hundred caves in
the Rockbridge area. The Washing-
ton and Lee cavers have also estab-
lished a camping area for those visit-
ing spelunkers who wish to take ad-
vantage of it. Recently the group
constructed a window display of
Spelunking equipment at Adair-
Hutton which will remain on dis-
play throughout the convention, and
bulletin boards outside the auditor-
ium will be used for a photo salon.

The formal meeting will begin at
1:00 p.m. on Saturday in duPont
Auditorium. The opening address
will be given on behalf of the host
grotto by Nick Denton, Phi Psi
sophomore. Some features are still
to be added to the actual program
but as of now the following are
definitely scheduled:

Dr. Francis Bick of the W&L Ge-
ology Department will talk on the
local geology of the area. John R.
Holsinger plans to deliver an ad-
dress entitled “Steam Tracing by
the Fluorescin Method.” William J.
Stephenson will discuss “An Experi-
ment to Determine the Age of Tol-
ley Cave,” this cave being located
near Lexington. Burton S. Faust will
review his paper on cave mining
which will be part of the Virginia
Cave Survey book.

One of the first projects of the
newly formed Lexington Grotto was
the exploration and subsequent map-
ing of Cave Springs, a cave familiar
to all Washington and Lee geology
students. The group spent over 140
hours last year in chartering the
almost three miles of passageways in
this cave. The resulting map which
was submitted to H. H. Douglas,
Chairman of the Washington, D.C.
Grotto and Director of the Virginia
Cave Survey, will be included in
his recently completed book on Vir-
ginia caves. Mr. Douglas, noted as
one of the area’s foremost spelunkers,
will feature this book in his lecture
to be given in conjunction with the
weekend's activities.

Another highlight of the meet-
ing will be a special exhibition in
rapelling from the face of Natural
Bridge. “This manuver,” said
Denton, “is planned for Sunday.
It involves the descent of the
bridge by using only ropes, and
should provide an exciting climax
to the convention.”

Help For Campus Club

Harry Meem and his Campus Club boys are doing a good
job. They put on a rush this year. They spoke at freshman
camp. They have provided for the freshmen who did not join
a fraternity a means of transportation to the various “mixers”’

at the neighboring girls schools.

They also held a reception for the parents of the Campus
Club boys after the parents’ weekend football game. This re-
ception was well patronized including among its attendents Dr.
Cole, Dean Farrar, and various other University dignitaries.

The club has obviously been more active this year than it
has been in the past. It needs and deserves encouragement. We

hear from its officers that this

year’s beginning has been en-

couraging. We would like to offer our encouragement and serv-

ices if they are needed.

We once heard one of the University’s recruiters tell a
parent that if a boy wasn’t in a fraternity at Washington and
Lee, he had a hard row to hoe. While we know there have been,
and still are, boys who have had quite successful and satisfying
careers at W&L without joining a fraternity, we have found
that most students, fraternity and non-fraternity, agree with

the above statement.

We have also heard that there is a plan afoot that would
put all students who wanted to join a fraternity in one of the

Greek letter clubs on campus.

We haven’t heard the details

of the plan and we presume that any such move would have
to be approved by the IFC or some other student committee
before it could become official. However, there has been some
serious consideration of such a plan.

We feel that if the Campus Club were to become even
more active and that if it had facilities with which to entertain
its members, it could take up the slack and provide those boys
who do not join a fraternity with much needed and varying

forms of recreation.

We realize that any plan for expanding and improving the
Campus club would require close cooperation and better or-
ganization among its members. We feel that these boys are
ready to cooperate and organize.

With a little aid from the University, a little work, and a

little effort on the part of the

club boys to cooperate a little

more, the Campus Club could become a more effective threat
to the Greek boys during rush week and a better organization
to provide social recreation for those boys who do not choose to

join a fraternity.

 

Kennedy Shoots

First, Asks

Foreign Policy Questions Later

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

Foreign policy is one of the areas
in which the candidates have their
greatest disagreement, and yet each
seems to take inconsistent positions.
Nixon favors toughness in the For-
mosa area, yet accuses Kennedy of
irresponsibility when he called for
U.S. intervention in Cuba. Thus it
seems that Nixon is more concerned
over events 8,000 miles away than he
is over those 90 miles of the Florida
coast.

There is no real inconsistency in
Nixon’s position, however. Nixon
wants us to defend those parts of the
world which are free, and to let the
Soviet Union and China know we are
willing to defend them, so that there
will be no necessity for another Ko-
rean “police action.’ Quemoy and
Matsu have the strategic importance
of blocking the two most likely ports
from which an invasion of Formosa
can be launched, and they are held
by an ally, the soverign state of the
Republic of China.

Cuba, on the other hand, is an
independent state in an extremely
volatile area. Direct, open Ameri-
ean intervention would only stiffen
the opposition of the Cuban people,
who seem to be behind their leader,
and alienate other Latin American
peoples. A quarantined Cuba can
be of real harm to no one but
herself, and will eventually be ripe
for the kind of subtle, indirect in-
terference which was used so ef-
fectively against Guatemala.

Latin American distrust of Yankee
interference is growing greater, and
Mr. Nixon is correct in not trying
to increase it. Thus, Nixon’s stand
on these two foreign policy problems
is not only a solution for these prob-
lems, it is indicative of his attitude
towards handling all foreign policy:
problems must be approached calmly,
rationally, with the future in mind,
so that the policy is an ordered
structure, not a make-shift hodge-
podge of patches and jury-rigging.

There is logic in Senator Kennedy’s
position, too. At the time that the
question was posed, someone had
decided to run a series of clips of
Kennedy talking to some old Ken-
tucky women who had lost sons in
one of the recent wars. Here, it must
have seemed, was a perfect chance to
get in another “no American boy will
fight on a foreign battlefield” speech.
So Kennedy said he thought we
should abandon the off-shore islands.

This, I’m sure, was hastily said
without any real comprehension of
the results of such a policy, which
would be a clear invitation to the
Chinese Communists to attack. Some
time later Kennedy retreated a little
from his original position, presum-
ably after he’d thought about it a
little. Perhaps he remembered the
disastrous results of a similar state-
ment by Mr. Dean Acheson con-
cerning Korea.

Then came Cuba. Possibly the
Democrats felt that Kennedy’s im-
age was not strong enough where
Communism was concerned, so
Kennedy said we should intervene
in Cuba. Once again we must con-
fess that we believe Senator Ken-
nedy to be an honorable and
thoughtful man. The pressure of
the campaign probably didn’t per-
mit Kennedy to think the matter
ever carefully enough. He has now
“explained” his original remarks
and now they sound a good deal
less wild than at first.

Twice, in the space of two months,
Kennedy has said things which, had
he been president when he said
them, would have led to serious
crises. He said them because he
was under pressure, not because he
didn’t understand the problems. He
just didn’t have time to understand
them.

In 1957 he made a speech about
Algeria which infuriated the French

Members and

Spelunkers Prepare Cave Assault

By HAL McCLANAHAN

The Lexington Grotto held their
first meeting for the forthcoming year
Friday, Oct. 14, in the Student Union
Building. The Grotto, which is one
of the many chapters of the National
Speleological Society (NSS), is com-
posed of W&L students and VMI
cadets.

The exploration of caves combines
the worlds of the sportsman and the
scientist. Spelunking is a year-round
sport, which challenges one’s imagi-
nation and physical prowess. It is
a very demanding sport, as the
Grotto usually takes six hours to
explore a cave.

Speleology is a relatively new
science. Of all the caves in the
world, only ten per cent of them
have been properly inspected, and
new caves are being discovered
sonstantly. The opportunities for
original research in _pratically
every natural science is limitless.
Nick Denton, a Phi Psi and chair-
man of the Lexington Grotto, says
“spelunking is like climbing a
warm Mount Everset at night.”

The program in the Grotto’s ini-
tial meeting was designed to acquaint
the potential members with the pur-
poses and activities of the NSS.
Slides were shown by Dr. Edgar W.
Spencer, Head of the Geology De-
partment and faculty adviser to the
club, and a discussion was held on
some of the techniques of spelunking.

The National Speleological So-
ciety was founded in 1939 by a
group of men and women in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, who were inter-
ested in the exploration and study
of caves. Affiliated with the Amer-
ican Association for the Advance-
ment of Science as well as foreign
speleogical organizations, the So-

 

 

initiates of the reorganized Lexington Grotto of the National Spelunking Association talk over

future plans.

ciety is the coordinating agency for
any information relating to spele-
ology. Its primary purpose is to pro-
mote the discovery and recording of
new caves and to protect caves and
their contents from vandalism.

In 1946 W&L had the largest
Grotto in the world with over 200
members. However, the club be-
came lax in the observance of vital
safety rules and the Grotto had to
be disbanded.

In September of 1959 a group of
students at W&L and VMI interested
in spelunking, banded together to
meet the NSS’s Grotto requirements
and were later granted a charter.
As members of a recognized Grotto,
spelunkers have access to many of
the NSS’s libraries, slides and pho-
tographs as well as unpublished rec-
ords, files, and maps of the Society.
A member may also buy his equip-
ment through the Grotto at reduced

rates. A recognized Grotto and its,

members may also explore any com-
mercial caves. It should be pointed
out that spelunkers who have ob-
served the NSS’s safety rules have
had not fatalities... yet.

The present Lexington Grotto
conducts most of its field trips and
cave explorations on Sunday after-
noons. A minimum of three persons
must be present for a “cave climb.”

Since the Shenandoah Valley is
considered on the five best caving
areas in the world, the Grotto is not
limited in its activities to one or
two locations. In fact, there are over
1200 recorded caves in the state of
Virginia alone. Rockbridge County,
itself, contains at least 100 known
caves of all kinds and sizes.

Besides exploring caves, the Lex-
ington Grotto works with the Lex-

 

ington and Buena Vista Rescue
Squads. Their main job is to locate
victims lost in caves and prepare
them for evacuation. The members
of the club also assist in W&L’s
geological field trips.

As a project last year, the Lexing-
ton Grotto mapped Cave Springs
Cave; the first time this had ever
been done completely. This project,
which took roughly 140 hours, re-
vealed almost three miles of under-
ground passagesways, which des-
cended through six levels and enter-
ed at various places into an under-
ground river. The maps from the
Lexington Grotto’s project will be
used in the forthcoming scientific
book, Virginia Cave Survey. As of
yet no projects have been set for
this year.

In order to become a member of
the Lexington Grotto, a person must
first, of course, have an interest in
spelunking. He will be given a
working knowledge of cave climb-
ing and cave safety by the Grotto’s
members before going on an organ-
ized climb. This precaution is taken
because every spelunker’s safety
underground depends on each of the
other members of the party.

On being accepted, a member must
also provide himself with the club
helmet as well as a secondary light
source.

To date, the following boys have
applied for membership: Bill Robin-
son, Bob Powell, Charles Kimbell,
Lynn Hammond, Fred Hulett,
Charles Urquhart, Jay Clark, Rick
Belser, Fred Bartlett, Charles Head,
Dick Heard, Jack Guthrie, Les Foote,
Herb Smith, and Spence McEvoy.

The next meeting of the Lexington
Grotto will be announced at a later
date. Anyone interested in joining
the club should call Nick Denton at
HO 3-5213.

School Traditions Questioned

By GERRY OUELLETTE

The University, it appears to us,
is undergoing a great period of
transition. Physical changes have
been effected: a new president, a
reestablishment of the administration
under three separate heads; a reju-
venation of the library schedule; the
installation of IBM and News Re-
lease units.

Material changes have not escaped
the trend. We now have adequate
lighting facilities in the library. The
Dean’s Offices, now centralized in
Washington Hall, certainly can be
counted as a major beneficial im-
provement.

We here list the changes, that
we have become acquainted with,
for the simple reason that we an-
ticipate (and urge) reformation of
other aspects. We refer to what
could be called the spirit of Wash-
ington and Lee.

Basically our spirit is part of the
Tradition. The Tradition, we feel, in
itself represents a good thing. Ideal-
ism elevates man. A challenge is the
stuff which creates good athletes
and saints; and the Tradition is a
challenge. We conclude that Tradi-
tion is worthwhile—fine.

Opposes Paraphernalia

What we oppose consists in the
paraphernalia with which the Tra-
dition is saturated. The parapher-
nalia of spirit never ceases to amaze
us. We wonder at what the spirit
allows under the label of “tradition-
ally W&L.” All we are left with af-
ter such a defense is a weak, “Oh?”,
and we swallow with difficulty.

There are many things—-some
intangible, some unmentionable—
which compose what is known as
Tradition. We are forced to re-
duce (perhaps conveniently) its
entity to three major traits: the
speaking tradition, conventional
dress, and the honor system.

 

These three form the bulwark of
the Tradition. It is our conten-
tion that this mighty triumvrate
consists in two parts fallacy.

The first, the speaking tradition,
means something to some freshmen;
but even then, very little time is
required before even this class of
undergrads realizes how mythologi-
cal this phase of University life real-
ly is. By the time the freshman be-
comes a sophomore, he has passed
the need to speak. However, he re-
members that last year he spoke,
and this year the sophomore con-
tents himself with a grunt or a groan,
as he passes another student.

The junior reduces the speaking
tradition further to a nod of the head,
sometimes accompanied by a slight
squint of the eyes and a quivering
of the lips. The senior avoids the
tradition altogether by looking the
other way.

The second great fallacy of the
Tradition, we name the old cus-
tom of conventional dress. This
ideal obviously is held by and for
the administration, the faculty, and
some of the students, some of the
time. It would prove interesting
to have the Assimilation Commit-
tee actively gestapoeing, say, Fri-
day and Saturday of Openings
week-end.

The third facet, the honor system,
is, to us, The Tradition. This ele-
ment of the Tradition stands alone as
a brightly burning torch, represent-
ing something very real. The Honor
System (the core of which states that
there are no dishonest students at
W&L) works; and we maintain that
anyone who tampers with the func-
tioning of the Honor System does not
remain among us long.

The purpose of this harangue is
to point to one heart felt desire
of ours, that could be achieved
during this period of transition
which we mentioned earlier.

 

We feel that any renovation of
the Tradition or spirit of W&L will
have to be a subtle move, which we
can only see as originating from
above. Evidently the student body is
ready for a modification of the defi-
nition usually given the Tradition of
Washington and Lee.

May we suggest to those in power
to arrive at definite results that the
Tradition be made equivalent with
the Honor System; that the para-
phenalia (the speaking tradition, the
conventional dress, and the meaning-
less publicity which is real only in
the minds of a few) be put to death.

Diary Recalls
Student’s Day
Of Class, Study

By ED WEBSTER

Having heard several complaints
that the average college student
doesn’t know the value of time, we
set out on some research. First we
asked a group of sophomoes to
choose one of their number as “Mr.
Average Student”; then we requested
this chap to keep a diary of his ac-
tivities.

Although he protested he didn’t
have the time to bother with an ex-
tended diary, Mr. A. S. was kind
enough to submit a few personal no-
tations on his activities for a single
day. It was a day like all days;
only, we were there.

As anyone can see, he was doing
something almost every minute;
therefore any charges of idleness
would seem to be unfounded:

7:45 am. Arose, breakfasted on
coffee and toast, read comics.

8:33. Arrived at class. Since prof.
had started lecturing, took no notes.
(Note: remember to copy notes be-
fore next quiz.)

9:20. Free period. Cup of coffee and
discussion of sex in Co-op.

10:15. English class. Report on
imagery in Paradise Lost is due next
week. (Note: must get plot outline
from Charley.)

11:10. Met Bob in library. Discus-
sion of sex.

12:05. French class. Professor dis-
cussed sex.

1:15 p.m. Being hungry, ate large
lunch. Became drowzy, decided that
movie would wake me up.

2-4:15. Flick team, Bad movie, but
many opportunities for ad-libs from
audience.

4:30. Popcorn had made me thirsty;
got beer at Paramount. Larry re-
minded me of history parallel as-
signment tomorrow. (Note: call
someone tonight and see if Larry was
telling the truth.)

5:15-6. Took well-earned nap.

6:15-6:30. Supper. Spaghetti again.

6:30-8:15. Played bridge, lost again.
Obviously my partner hadn’t been
keeping in practice.

8:30-9:45. Watched fraternity
brothers in scrimmage basketball
game. Pretty disheartening.

10-11. Two fairly good Westerns
on TV. Very relaxing after a hard
day.

11:05. Remembered history parallel
assignment; too late to call anyone.
Probably Larry was kidding any-
way.

11:06 Read July issue of Nugget.
Joe and I discussed the nude in art.
(Note: he prefers Escapade.)

11:18. Read Joe’s copy of Escapade
for purposes of comparison. (Note:
all women are basically the same.)

11:30. Looked over tomorrow’s
psychology lesson. What a bunch of
nonsense.

11:37. Got hamburger at White Top.
(Note: what ever happened to that
cute waitress?)

12:10 a.m. Looked over last week’s
economics assignments. Must re-
member to read them more thor-
oughly before quiz.

12:30 . Roommate and I argued
whether his chemistry professor is
harder than my economics prof.
(Note: we decided a language major
is easiest. Maybe I'll give Spanish a
try.)

12:57. And so to bed.

Generals Trounce Tigers,

H-S Dominates First Half Play; |

W&L Shines In Closing Quarters

Washington and Lee’s Five-Star
Generals assured themselves of their
first winning season since 1951 with
a come-from-behind 14-7 victory
over the fighting Tigers of Hampden-
Sydney. The victory stretched the
Generals’ undefeated streak to seven
games and left them 5-0-1 for the
season.

Play in the first half was domi-
nated by Hampden-Sydney, as the
Generals were slow getting started.
W&L’s only drive of the half was
stalled on the Tigers’ six, minutes
before the intermission. Twice in
the early part of the game the
Tigers, led by the passing of Stew-
art Shelton to end Bob Saylor,
threatened to score. Both times
they were stopped: once by a
fumble on the 21-yard line and
the second time by a pass inter-
ception on the 30.

The beginning of the second quart-
er saw the Tigers take over on
downs at Washington and Lee’s 44.
Lewis Everett, on the second play,
broke away and carried the ball
down to the 15. After a loss of four
yards, Shelton completed a 16-yard
pass to Tony Rucker for a first down
on the three. Two plays later, Shel-
ton scored on a quarterback sneak.
Fred Mitchell converted the point
after touchdown to put the Tigers
out in front 7-0 with thirteen min-
utes left till the half.

The Generals, moving 84 yards,
scored the first time they got the
ball in the third quarter. Steve
Suttle ignited the drive with a
22-yard pass to Doug Martin.
Charlie Gummey picked up twenty
more yards on two carries to move
the ball down to the Tigers’ 12. Two
plays later, Gummey went around
right and for 10 yards and paydirt.

 

Gummey Is Star Of Week

This week’s selection for the out-
standing player in the game with
Hampden-Sydney last week is
Charlie Gummey, a sophomore from
Wilmington, Del. Gummey was
moved to a starting role at halfback
to replace the ailing Bob Funkhouser
this week, and once there he per-
formed like a veteran. In leading the
Generals to victory Gummey carried
the ball 14 times for a total of 62
yards, an average of 4.4 pards per

The try for the extra point failed, |
and Hampden-Sydney led 7-6.

Midway in the fourth quarter, the
Generals struck for 80 yards and
the decisive touchdown. Again, it
was a Martin-Suttle pass, this time
good for 26 yards, that got Washing- |
ton and Lee moving. With the ball |
on the Tigers’ 43, Martin burst
through the middle for 13 yards. |
After a one yard gain, the Generals
scored on a 29-yard pass from Mar-
tin, who faked a sweep around left
end, to Ned Hobbs, who was stand-
ing alone in the end zone. Gummey
bulled his way over for tH® two
extra points and put the Generals
ahead for the first time 14-7.

Washington and Lee made an-
other bid for a score in the wan-
ing minutes of the game when Ter-
ry Fohs intercepted a pass and re-
turned it 43 yards to Hampden-
Sydney’s six. Four plays later, the
Tigers took over on downs on their
own six-inch line.

Charlie Gummey was the leading
ground gainer with 65 yards on 15
carries. For the day, the Generals
picked up 304 yards to the Tigers’
196 yards.

 

Ferrum Beats Freshmen
In Close Game Friday

Friday, Oct. 27, Ferrum Junior
College handed the Washington and
Lee Freshman football team its sec-
ond loss of the season, 20-18. The
game featured several long runs
and passes including a 97 yard kick-
off return. The Generals’ offense
moved well against the Panthers,
but the W&L defense could not con-
tain the big, hard driving Ferrum
backs.

Ferrum took the opening kickoff

Bootmen Win

Third Game

The Washington and Lee soccer
team evened their season’s record at
3 wins and 3 losses with a decisive
6-2 victory over North Carolina
State on Smith Field yesterday.

Led by Steve Hawkins with 4
goals and Jim Starkey and co-captain
Dave Knight with one goal apiece,
the Generals scored in every period
including three tallies in the final
frame to win their first game in the
last four starts.

Halfback Bob Pagano, fullbacks
Dunlop Ecker and Harry Preston,
along with goalie Clark Valentiner,
who had 25 saves, played good ball
containing the powerful Wolfpack
offense to two scores.

North Carolina State, fielding a
team made up predominately of
foreigners, played short passing, con-
trolled soccer at a much slower pace
than the Generals were used to. The
first period was marked by sloppy,
indecisive play from both teams, and

| W&L failed to turn two penalty

kick opportunities into goals.

North Carolina State struck first
in the scoring department as right-
wing Del Carmen got behind the

It was a satisfying win in “Death
Valley.”

Hampden-Sydney played inspired
football in the first half in an ef-
fort to win for their homecoming
crowd. However, our Generals came
out for the second half determined
to win and quickly took the initiative
away from the fighting Tigers. The
second half was all ours.

Terry Fohs had another fine day.
He took part in 20 tackles and in-
tercepted a pass to snuff out Hmp-
den-Sydney’s last bid for an ef-
fective drive. He ran the ball back
some 40 yards to the eight-yard
line and just missed going all the
way.

Tommy Goodwin and Courtney
Mauzey played well. Joe Hess is se-
lected as the unsung star for his work
on the defensive. He thwarted the
Tigers’ attempts to round his end,
and he was the prime rusher who
caused many of their passes to go
astray.

Wish us luck in Pittsburgh this
Saturday.

THE PARTY WEEKEND: ITS CAUSE
AND CURE

With the season of party weekends almost upon us, my mail of
late has been flooded with queries from young inmates of women’s
colleges wishing to know how one conducts one’s self when one
has invited a young gentleman for a weekend, so let us today
take up this burning issue.

Well, my dear girls, the first thing to remember is that your
young gentleman is far from home and frightened. Put him at
his ease. You might, for instance, surprise him by having his
mother sitting in a rocker on the station platform when he gets
off the train.

Next, what kind of corsage should you send your young gentle-
man? Well, my beloved maidens, orchids are always acceptable.
So, indeed, are phlox and delphinium. In fact, most any flora
will serve. Do try, however, to avoid carnivorous plants.

If you find, my esteemed fillies, that your local florist has run
out of stock, do not be dismayed. Make a corsage out of paper.
But pick good, stiff, durable paper—twenty dollar bills, for
example.

Remember at all times, my fond wenches, to show your young
gentleman courtesy and consideration. Open doors for him,
walk on the traffic side of the path, assist him to the punch bowl,
zip his parka, light his Marlboros. (What, you ask, if he doesn’t
smoke Marlboros? Ridiculous, my precious nymphs! Of course,
he smokes Marlboros! Don’t you? Don’t I? Doesn’t everybody
who knows a hawk from a handsaw? What other cigarette
gives you such a lot to like? Such easy-drawing filtration? Such
unfiltered taste? Such soft pack or flip-top box? No other, my
sweet minxes, no other. Marlboro stands alone, and any man
worthy of you, my estimable damsels, is bound to be a Marlboro
man.)

If you will follow the simple instructions stated above, my
good lasses, you will find that you have turned your young
gentleman into a fast and fervent admirer. There is nothing
quite like a party weekend to promote romance. I am in mind
of a party weekend some years ago at Miss Pomfritt’s Seminary
for well-born females in West Linotype, Ohio. Serafina Sigafoos,

a sophomore at this institution, majoring in napkin folding, sent
an invitation to a young man named Fafnir Valve, a junior at

the Joyce Kilmer School of Forestry, majoring in sap and boles.
Serafina had been ape for Fafnir since high school, but Fafnir
preferred a girl named Gelia Fleshwound, the high school drum
majorette who once threw a baton so high she impaled a south-

bound mallard.
Anyhow, Serafina sent an invitation to Fafnir, and he came,
and she showered him with kindness and cuff links, and then

he went away, and Serafina sat anxiously by the mailbox,
wondering whether she would ever hear from him again. Sure
enough, two weeks later she got a letter: ‘‘Dear Serafina, Can
you let me have fifty bucks? Yours, Fafnir.”’

Whimpering with ecstasy, she ran to the bank and withdrew
the money and mailed it to him. From then on, she got the
same request every week, and as a result, she became very well
acquainted with Ralph T. Involute, teller of the West Linotype
Bank and Trust Co., and their friendship ripened into love, and
today they are happily married and live in Stamen, Oregon,
where Ralph is in the extruded molasses game and Serafina

is a hydrant.

and drove all the way to score. The
visitors also added the two extra
points, the only successful conver-
version of the afternoon. W&L struck
back near the end of the first quarter
and scored on a 16 yard pass from
John McDaniel to Stu Yoffe. Fer-
rum scored again in the second quart-
er after recovering a bad pitch-out
on the W&L 23. The half ended with
the Generals trailing 14-6.

The Panthers had another scor-
ing opportunity in the third quart-
er when a pass interference penal-
ty gave them the ball on the W&L
25. This time the General defense
tightened and held Ferrum for the
4 downs. W&L scored for the sec-
ond time when Mike Sheffey inter-
cepted a pass on the Ferrum 27 and
McDaniel again hit Yoffe on a pass
play for the score.

In the final minutes of the game
Ferrum took the ensuing kickoff
and went 54 yards in two plays to
boost their advantage 20-12. Yoffe
took the kickoff on the W&L three
yard line and scampered 97 yards
behind fine blocking to score. Henry
Sackett was stopped short on the try
for two extra points. W&L got the
ball again with a minute left, but
time ran out with the Generals on
the Ferrum 40 yard line.

of a great driving force of self-
interest, and there are both good
and bad qualities in all of them.”

“The Romans let self-interest fade,
however,” said Dr. Hadas, “and Hu-
manism as a force faded until the
Renaissance.”

Then, he pointed out, this obsession
for self-interest arises again in the
individualistic, yet imitative, styles
of the Renaissance men.

“People began looking for some-
thing worthwhile, and happened to
find it in classicism. But the bond
was not some intangible ethical doc-
trine of Humanism, but instead a
bond of scholarship, and individual
scholarship at that.”

Washington and Lee evened the score
up before the end of the first period

a pass from Steve Hawkins and out
manuvered State’s goalie Brough-
ton.

After four minutes of the sec-
ond period Hawkins, from his new-
ly acquired center forward spot
topped off a W&L offensive drive
with a goal that put the home team
ahead to stay.

Play went back and forth during
most of the third period. The off-
side penalties against North Carolina
State and alert play on the defense
helped the Generals’ cause. Later in
the period, taking an out of bounds
kick from Wick Hollingshead, Knight
headed the ball into the nets mak-
ing the score 3-1 for the Blue and
