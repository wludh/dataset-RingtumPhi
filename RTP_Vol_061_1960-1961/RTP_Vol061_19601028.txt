Welcome To

The Four Freshmen, Ray Eberle,
And TNT Tribble In Center Ring

By PETER ALFORD
Staff Reporter

Ray Eberle, The Four Freshmen,
T.N.T. Tribble and “The Greatest
Show on Earth” all are combining
to make 1960 Openings most success-
ful in the series of dance sets. A
cocktail party, the formal dance,
Saturday afternoon’s concert and an
informal dance that evening will
highlight the weekend.

Openings starts this afternoon with
the cocktail party given by the Betas
in honor of Pearce Hardwick, pres-
ident of the dance set. The party is
being held in the Pine Room of the
Mayflower Inn beginning at 4:30.
The feature entertainment is T.N.T.
Tribble, accurately billed as “the
walking drummer.”

Eberle Plays

At the Openings Dance tonight,
Ray Eberle, who was so successful
at last year’s Openings, will play
again. Vice-Presidents in charge of
art decorations and _ construction,
John White, Pete Agelasto, and Bud-

 

dy Jones, have transformed somber
Doremus Gymnasium into a colorful
circus atmosphere. “The Greatest
Show on Earth” theme is furthered
by appropriate murals on two walls,
circus rings and animal cages.

A new feature this year, which
does away with the false ceiling used
in past dances, is the crepe paper
tent which adds to the carnival ef-
fect.

The figure will be directed by
vice-president Grantham Couch
and announced by Roy Goodwin. It
is composed of president Hardwick,
vice-presidents Charles Commander,
David Beale, Agelasto, White, Jones
and Couch. The Cotillion Club and
their dates will be presented at 10
p.m.

Four Freshmen Sing

The traditional Saturday afternoon
concert, from 4-5:30, will will be
presented by the nationally famous
quartet, The Four Freshmen. This
group, known for “In the Still of the
Night,” “Got a Date With an Angel,”

Troub Publicity Director
John Cotten Towler, a Delt senior
from Halifax, Virginia, was elected
president of the Troubadour Theatre
of Washington and Lee University
for its 1960-61 season at a recently
held meeting.

Towler has appeared in several
Troub productions in the past few
years. His most well-received char-
acterizations were the young student
in “Visit to a Small Planet” (1958),
and his performance as the Samur-
ai warrior in last season’s produc-
tion of “Rashomon.”

Other Activities

Towler has also been active in
other phases of school life. He has
been secretary of his fraternity, news
editor of the Ring-tum Phi, and a
member of the student library com-
mittee. He is currently serving the
W&L ROTC corps as Deputy Battle
Group Commander, a student ves-
teryman at Lee Memorial Episcopal
Church, and is for the second year,
announcer at the home football
games.

Towler’s principal duty as presi-
dent of the Troubs will be to serve
as liaison officer between the stu-
dent and faculty-administration of
the theatre group.

Other Officers

In the same election, Luke Kauf-
man, of Staten Island, N. Y., was
elected business manager. As such
he will handle the Troub financial
affairs as well as the front of the
house arrangements. Tim Morton, of
Roanoke, Va., was selected as sea-
sonal stage manager. He will super-
vise all physical aspects of the pro-

 

ductions and will assist the director
at rehearsals.

John Dunnell of Brooklyn, N. Y.,
will serve as Troub Personnel Di-
rector. His work will include acting
as secretary for the organization as

Sullins Group
Sings Te Deum
With Glee Club

By TOM EDWARDS
Glee Club Publicity Agent

The combined singing groups of
Sullins College, in Bristol, Va., and
Washington and Lee will sing Mon-
day, Nov. 7, in Doremus gymnasium.

Before the intermission, both
groups will sing a number of their
selections. Following the intermis-
sion, the groups will join to sing
Te Deum by Anton Bruckner. This
number was written from 1881 to
1885 and was first heard with full
orchestra on January 10, 1886.

Newbin Says

Famed critic Dika Newbin says of
Bruckner: “His religion was the
foundation of everything he said and
did.”

Thus in Te Deum we become
aware of the spiritual quality which
permeates the life of its composer.
Te Deum, in fact, was dedicated to
God and His glorification.

Columbia Records has this to say
of Bruckner: Te Deum in its record-
ing of his work:

James Vann, president of the
Washington and Lee Dance Board,
said last night that several cases of
failure to meet the obligation of pay-
ing for dance plans had not been met.

Due Oct. 15

The money for the plans was due
Oct. 15, and those who have still not
paid are advised to do so immedi-
ately by the Dance Board.

Vann also re-emphasized the fact
that the dance plans are not trans-
ferable, and any attempt to trans-
fer them would be considered a vio-
lation of the W&L honor code.

Formal Dance

The first dance tonight is from
nine to one. The dress is formal,
and no one will be admitted to the
dance floor unless they are in for-
mal attire.

At the Saturday afternoon con-
cert and the Saturday night dance,
from eight to 12, the dress is to be
conventional.

It is re-emphasized by the student
executive Committee that there is to

function.

Smoking on the dance floor has
also been banned this year due to
the hazard of fire.

All other rules of the university
are in effect this weekend, also, and

Students are reminded that there
is to be no public drinking.

Caution is also urged for those
who are driving this weekend. The
staff of the Ring-tum Phi wishes to
join in the plea for caution. The
university has had only one serious
accident thus far this year, and it is
the hope of all that accidents be con-
fined to that one.

Recently galavanting around the
grounds of Washington and Lee
campus has been a_ gargantuan
whilopo-whalopus, sucking up
leaves, stirring dust into whirlwinds,
and generally causing the greatest
amount of curiosity that has ever
stretched the imaginations of cam-
pus observers. The mysterious ma-
chine just seems to appear out of
nowhere, romp around yards creat-
ing its disturbance, and then it is
gone. It will again seem to appear
arbitrarily on the scene for a re-
peat performance only to arouse the
wonderment of onlookers. It just
seems to come and go and nobody
knows what it is.

Finally, yesterday, one staunch
soul sought bravely to find the origin
of such a roustabout; and success
of his efforts was found in the of-
fice of the Superintendent of Build-
ings and Grounds, Mr. Pat Brady.
Mr. Brady’s explanation of the
curiosity-producer follows and
should appease the troubled souls
who have allowed themselves to
become upset by this newfangled
thing.

Cost About $300

The technical name of the machine
is a Utility Harvester, and its orig-
inal purpose was to cut and harvest
green alfalfa and various other types
of hay. It is believed that the ma-
chine is an outdated model. It be-
longs to Baker Brothers, Inc., who
are dealers of farm equipment here
in the town of Lexington. Washing-
ton and Lee has not yet bought the
machine, but it probably will within
the next week. Mr. Brady estimated
the cost of the thing at about $300.

The primary purpose of the harv-
ester during the Fall months is to
pick up the leaves. And plans are
being made to use it for cutting
grass in the rough areas during the
summer months. These plans of
course will call for adaptation of the
machine for such purposes. The har-
vester was originally designed sole-
ly for the purpose which the name
implies. However, it is so built that
many purposes can be derived from
the original.

Many questions have arisen about
the machine in general, one of which
deals with the source of the bags
which flap in the breeze as the ma-
chine romps. They are “wool sacks”
originally used for shipping wool.
They hold approximately one bale
of leaves, and they are rented from
a local feed store. The means by
which the bags are attached to the
chute is a homemade affair along
with several other minor improve-
ments.

Another question is “What hap-
pened to the old process of leaf gath-
ering and what happened to all of
the men who had that wonderful

 

Washington and Lee’s very own Gargantuan Whilopo-Whalopus shown here
“raking” leaves in front of the Library.

job?” In the past the leaves have
been raked and baled up and carted
away. Several extra men were hired
during the season for the jceb; and
a hay-baler was borrowed from
a local farmer along with the farmer
himself and the was was thus done.
What happened to the leaves? Well,
many times the farmer took them for
his own use, but sometimes they were
dumped down the hill behind the
Chemistry annex and left to rot.
However, the problem arose that
W&L was running out of the com-
post which these rotten leaves pro-
duced and decided to replenish the
supply. Utilizing the idea of keeping
the leaves for producing compost,
some one in the Building and
Grounds Department hit upon the
idea of harvesting the leaves; and
now we have a leaf harvester.

Instead of having someone else
gathering up the leaves, Washing-
ton and Lee now does all the work.
They pile up the leaves to produce
compost, most of which already has
been used around the shrubbery at
the Commons.

As for what happened to the men
who used to have the great job of
raking, they are now employed in
other services in the same Depart-
ment of Building and Grounds.

Mr. Brady seemed to be rather
pleased with the machine as he has
great aspirations for it. As for a
comment on the questions which
had been asked about the eo:
he merely said, “It’s a big, ugly, noisy
machine.”

English ‘Rush Week’ Offers
Over One Hundred Choices

By JON B. McLIN
Friday Columnist

“Whenever two Englishmen meet,
a new club is born.” A more apt
quotation could not be cited to ex-
plain the maze of clubs and socie-
ties which, to most incoming fresh-
men, is at once the most awesome
and the most promising aspect of
Oxford life.

Most of the freshman’s first two
weeks at Oxford is occupied with the
local brand of rush week, during
which colleges representatives of all
the University clubs and societies
make ardent efforts to get his two and
sixpence (35c) and his name on the
rolls of their respective groups.

The total number of these groups
is probably 100, although the exact
number is truly incalculable, as
clubs are coming into and going out
of existence constantly. In addition,
the thirty-odd colleges have many
such organizations among themselves.

Every conceivable interest is rep-
resented by one or more of these
groups. Politics, religion, the arts,
individual faculties (language, his-
tory, sociology, etc.), national groups,

 

|

affairs each week, and the speakers
who come for them are generally
quite distinguished. Members of
Parliament, Ministers, and Civil
Service officials are frequent visi-
tors. In addition foreign dignitaries—
both in and out of the academic
world—are regularly featured.

Other activities of the groups in-
clude the pursuit of the special pur-
poses for which they were formed:
for dramatic groups, the production
of plays; for political groups, the
conduct of propaganda campaigns,
etc. There are also occasional social
functions with members of one or
more of the five women’s colleges.
In addition, some groups have facili-
ties—such as meeting rooms, librar-
ies, and bars—which may be used by
their members.

Many Display Enthusiasm

The range of zeal with which these
activities are pursued is consider-
able. Many groups display great en-
thusiasm and dedication. A notable
example of this are the liberal po-
litical groups and, in particular, the
Combined Universities Campaign for

sports, and special interests are all} Nuclear Disarmament, which sup-

represented by many different
groups.

Among the most slothful, unen-
thusiastic solicitations which many
freshmen received was that of the
Apathy Club, one of the more re-
cently formed groups. Asked about
its nature, a spokes replied: “We
have no meetings, no members, no
interests.”

Lists of Speakers

Standard operating procedure for
these clubs is to provide the new
members with a card listing the
speakers which that club will sponsor
during term. Each group averages
about one of these seminar-type

 

ported the unilateralist position re-
cently adopted by the Labor Party
Conference at Scarborough.

At the other extreme is a Wad-
ham College group called the Birk-
enhead Society. At a recent meeting
of the student government of the
college the President of the Society,
when asked to report on its opera-
tions, responded with a motion to do
away with it. Although he was Pres-
ident, he said, he had never attend-
ed a meeting of the group nor did
he know what its function was.
Characteristically, his motion was
defeated and he was re-elected in
reward for a job well done!

One organization which stands out
among these many and variegated
groups is the Oxford Union Society,
the University debating club. The
Union, as it is generally known,
sponsors weekly debates during term
in which undergraduate members of
the University participate jointly
with well-known public figures. Such
is the reputation of the Oxford de-
bates that few men who are out-
standing in British public life have
not appeared at some time in one
of them.

In addition to its role as a debating
hall the Union provides club facili-
ties—consisting of a 50,000 volume
lending library, dining room, bar,
billards and television rooms, and a
dance hall—to the University mem-
bers, most of whom belong to the
Union. Elaborate though it is, U.Va.’s
“ping pong palace” cannot hold a
candle in comparison!

Trifling Tidbits

Humiliating to all Oxford men
was the academic ranking of the
various colleges, based on last term’s
results and just recently released:
the five women’s colleges were all in
the top six places. Tops for the men
was Magdalen, followed by Wad-
ham...Americans are finding it
difficult to assess c impaign news
from the States, as English news-
papers all show a heavy pro-Ken-
nedy bias, even in the news stories.
Reaction: an ed in the London
Times classified section enlisting
support of those desirous of a fair
press treatment for Nixon...Ox-
onians have a unique term for the
British counterparts of the Ameri-
can “square,” “out,” or “conform-
ist.” Here they are called “grey men,”
and greyness is a thing to be de-
plored by those with verve.
; Cheerio!

 

Non-Partisan Leadership Issue
Neglected In Current Campaign

By VIC LASSETER
Friday Columnist

One of the issues which has been
neglected in the current political
campaign is the question of which
presidential candidate can provide
the necessary non-partisan leader-
ship during the next four years. Some
reasons for this neglect are (1)
neither candidate can tell the Ameri-
can people that he and only he has
the imagination, leadership, and
sense of equity to serve as a non-
partisan president and then escape
the charge of immodest boasting and
(2) this issue is essentially intan-
gible and cannot be reduced to for-
mulae; it must be treated some-
what speculatively.

Nonetheless, this is an issue worth
discussion because of the importance
of non-partisan leadership in the
crises which will invariably face the
next president. These crises will oc-
cur in such areas as US. prestige
abroad, for the Communists will be
doing everything possible to dis-
credit U.S. leadership in the world;
and in space and defense programs,
for we will be faced with (1) increas-
ing Russian competition and with
(2) the possibility of a growth in
the possession of nuclear weapons to
minor powers. To meet these chal-
lenges the next president will have
to rise above his party affilation and
lead the nation as a whole.

Leadership Needed

To meet these challenges, and we
are deceiving ourselves if we deny
their existence, the next president
must exert a vigorous executive lead-
ershop. Vigorous executive leader-
ship does not necessarily mean more
government control; it means that the
president must be a leader who is
in command of every situation and
who can gain the confidence of the
people. It means that the president
is a symbol of the aspirations of the
people, and these people stand be-
hind him with affirmative popular
support.

The requisites for non-partisan
leadership are therefore the ability to
capture the trust, confidence, and
imagination of all the people, and
also command of a strong party or-
ganization which can serve as a uni-

 

fied foundation of the president’s be-
liefs.

In general, neither Mr. Nixon nor
Mr. Kennedy has the complete con-
trol of their respective political par-
ties. Mr. Kennedy, however, has
only one faction, the Southern con-
servative block, with which to con-
tend; Mr. Nixon must deal with the
liberal wing of his party, led by Gov.
Rockefeller, and the ultra-conserva-
tive wing, led by Sen. Goldwater.
Mr. Kennedy, however, will have
the services of Lyndon Johnson in
dealing with the Southern faction
and Mr. Johnson is no mean master
of party politics. What is more, the
Southern conservatives are in a
minority and are not intent upon
capturing the leadership of their
party.

Sen. Goldwater, however, has
promised to lead the ultra-conserva-
tives back to power in the Republi-
can party, and this threat might ser-
iously challenge Mr. Nixon’s lead-
ership of his party. The closer
the views of all factions of a political
party to the views of its leader, the
firmer foundation upon which that
leader can lead the nation.

Liberals for Kennedy

Another requisite for non-partisan
leadership is the affirmative support
of the national electorate. Negative-
voting is no strange phenomenon to
American politics, but it is present in
this campaign to a frightening degree.
Mr. Kennedy has the unqualified
support of the liberals of the nation;
these liberals will not be voting
against Mr. Nixon, they will be vot-
ing for Mr. Kennedy.

Mr. Nixon, however, lacks the af-
firmative support of the nation’s
conservatives. Conservatives, as ex-
pressed by many Washington and
Lee students will vote for Mr. Nix-

on because he is “the lesser of two

evils,” not because they believe in
him as a great leader. For the same
reason, Mr. Nixon will receive the
votes of some Protestants who would
be delivered from the Catholic men-
ace.

Why does Mr. Nixon lack this en-

thusiastic, affirmative popular sup- |

port? Mr. Nixon is not clearly a
liberal, not clearly a conservative, not

clearly a middle-of-the roader; the
thus is unable to obtain the whole-
hearted committment of any of these
groups. Mr. Kennedy, however, is
by his own definition a liberal, he has
this group firmly on his side.

Nixon Lacks Warmth

Secondly, Mr. Nixon lacks that
communicative warmth which char-
acterized such great leaders as Lin-
coln, Wilson, and FDR each of
whom was able to lead the people
through crises because the people be-
lieved in Lincoln, Wilson, and FDR.

Perhaps Mr. Nixon can improve
himself in this respect, but his re-
cent campaign speeches make this
seem rather improbable. Instead of
aiming at the higher faculties of the
voting public, Mr. Nixon aims at
the lower faculties. Such statements
as “Look behind the label...See if
its the kind of goods you want to
buy,” “Jack’s jack can’t solve our
problems” can hardly capture the
imagination and affirmative sup-
port of the intelligent voter.

Kennedy Not ‘Elvis or FDR’

Mr. Kennedy does have this ar-
ticulateness necessary for leader-
ship. His popularity is based on his
warmth, not his subliminal adver-
tising. Mr. Kennedy is not, as claim-
ed in a recent editorial in the Tues-
day Ring-tum Phi, a cross between
Elvis Presley and FDR. Sen. Ken-
nedy’s popularity was described by
Sen. Smathers as a cross between the
popularity of FDR and Elvis Pres-
ley in an aside aimed at the ironic
sensibilities of a college-town audi-
ence, most of whom would be ex-
| pected to interpret the statement in
j its context.
| Our next president should be
| elected on the basis of his position
!towards the great issues. Nonethe-
less, these intangibles which make
a great leader remain the best lead-
| er is the leader who has the positive
; support of the people, and I feel
| that Sen. Kennedy has this support.

Goldwater and others do have cer-
tain valid objections to Social Se-
curity, I tried to point out that
Sen. Goldwater’s objections seemed
a little ridiculous in view of the
fact that he wishes to abolish not
only Social Security, but also pro-
gressive taxation and all govern-
mental activity not expressly given
to the federal government by the
Constitution. Furthermore, I pointed
out the illogical premise of Sen.
Goldwater’s attack upon progressive
taxation. His premises for oppos-
ing Social Security are, I feel, equally
illogical, and if I was not specific
enough in my article I would like
to take this opportunity to clarify
my views.

If, as the Tuesday columnist says,
the basis for conservative opposi-
tion to Social Security is the belief
of conservatives that such legisla-
tion deprives the individual of eco-
nomic freedom, then I feel that this
premise shows a lack of common-
sense. Social Security is an involun-
tary tax as are, of course, all other
forms of taxation. Taxation does not
deprive the individual of economic
freedom or of the right to control the
means of production. Just as a paci-
fist pays approximately three-fourths
of his tax dollar for defense which
is necessary to national military sur-
vival, so must an advocate of eco-
nomic laissez-faire pay Social Se-
curity taxes to help preserve our
economic survival.

Social Security helps preserve our
economic survival because (1) it
acts as a stimulant in depressionary
periods, and (2) it eliminates some
of the inherent weaknesses of the
capitalistic system. Our economy is
not, as economic conservatives like
to believe, an automatic process.
Businessmen alone cannot prevent
periods of economic disaster, but the
government can to a certain extent.
Furthermore, our state of advanced
technology almost automatically de-
prives the worker of employment
after he has reached the age of 65.
It is therefore not inconsistent with
capitalism to alleviate this inherent
injustice. Social Security, therefore,
helps control the business cycle of
the free enterprise system and ac-
tually strengthens this system by
eliminating some of the weakness of
capitalism upon which Communism
thrives.

When apostles of the doctrine of
economic laissez-faire realize that
our economy cannot function in
times of depression without some
government activity in economic ac-
tivity perhaps they will give up
their notion of an automatic econ-
omy. In the meantime, however, I
feel that their objections to Social
Security are based not on their de-
sire to preserve our system of free
enterprise, a desire shared by eco-
nomic liberals, but on their pocket-
books. If we are one of the most
prosperous nations in the world
we at home often seem to be the
most parsimonious.

To the Editor
The Ring-tum Phi:

Are you an “intellest” or an “in-
tellect” (what is it?), and or both?

This is the case which generally
exists at Lexington, Virginia, home
of the pride of our Valley. Wash-
ington and Lee University, I think,
contains a fine example of the Lazy
American, not the Ugly one.

“Somebody tells me that the Vic-
torians, not just Englishmen, had
“hideous taste” (and therefore shock-
ing) in (1) architecture; (2) music
(?); and (3) literature (!?). I dis-
agree with everything here, but the
contention about architecture, of
which the Lee Chapel is an example.
The point, if there is one, is that we
are far worse off than the Victorians
now, and in larger, glaring aspects
of our society,—“Red” or “Blue”
Square, Lexington, Virginia.

The frat system is not sick. We
love all our brothers; our big broth-
er says to! And the Weavers are
wonderful when they sing “On Top
of Old Smoky.” What we are doing,
in our swinging, minkish way is to
convince ourselves that we are sick
in America, at W&L. We are not sick,
and we should stop thinking so. We
are trying to be indifferent, blase.

Bob Funkhouser Is Out For H-S Contest; Hickey,
Gummey Will Share Left Halfback Duties On Sat.

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Sports Editor

Washington and Lee’s Generals,
who lost a major part of the “Go”
in their “Go-T” offense last week,
descend tomorrow into Hampden-
Sydney’s Death Valley.

W&L faces the Tigers, who have
crushed the Generals the last five
years in a row, minus the services
of its first three men at left half-
back—the position Coach Lee Mc-

Laughlin describes as “the most
important” in W&L’s “Go-T” of-
fense.

Sidelined are Bob Funkhouser,
Dave Tharpe, and Skipper Smith.
Funkhouser, the team’s leading
scorer and second leading rusher,
is out with a kidney ailment;
Tharp, the number two man, has |
the flu; and Smith, the third unit |
operative, is lost for the season
with a head injury.

 

But big, smiling McLaughlin isn’t |
particularly disturbed. He figures,
the Generals’ main asset—depth— |
will carry them through the —_
spots. At least he hopes so.

Stepping into the number one left |
half spot is junior Jim Hickey, who |
returned to full action against Johns |
Hopkins after missing the Generals’ |
first four games with a leg injury. |

|
|

Against Hopkins, Hickey spear-
headed the Generals’ only touch-
down drive with a 26-yard burst
around left end, which gave W&L
a first down on the Hopkins’ two.
Two plays later the 165-pound

speedster plunged over from the
one for the score.

Should Hickey re-injure his leg,
McLaughlin will send in sophomore
Charlie Gummey, whom the coach
has switched from right halfback

to the troubled left half slot. This
may be a key transfer.

“Charlie was our regular left half
on the freshman squad last year,”

McLaughlin said, “and he should fit

in well without too much difficulty.

 

He would have been there on the
varsity if we hadn’t had such ex-
perienced men in front of him. Now
he'll get a real chance.”

Although Gummey has carried
only ten times as a second unit
right halfback, he has averaged a
neat 5.9 yards per carry. In addi-
tion he is the Generals’ leading
pass receiver with six receptions,
84 yards, and one touchdown.

At 191 pounds, Gummey has both
speed and power and will beef up
the W&L offense.

In putting the first mar of the
year on the Generals’ record, Johns
Hopkins became the first team that

was able to both run at will on
W&L’s defense and hold W&L’s
powerful offense.

But McLaughlin was pleased
with the Generals’ performance,
especially the hard play of Little
All-American candidate Terry
Fohs and guard Tommy Goodwin.
Fohs accounted for an almost in-
credible 23 tackles and Goodwin’s
tough play forced Hopkins to run
to the opposite side while he
was in the game.

“Our boys had their backs to
the goal the entire second half,” Mc-
Laughlin said. “They could have
cracked any one of a half dozen

 

 

times, but they kept digging in when
it counted. Sure, we had a few
breaks on defense, but it took a lot
of heart to play as they did.”

The Generals will have their hands
full as usual against Hampden-
Sydney tomorrow McLaughlin said.

“We'll see the best backfield we'll
face all year. We know what Charlie
Sears can do to us, and we've got
all the respect in the world for Lew
Everett and the other Tiger backs.”

The Tigers splashed through the
mud at Petersburg last year to top
the Generals, 12-0. Everett set up
the first H-S score and Sears broke
away for the second Tiger tally.

Coach Mac Solves Defensive Problems
With Algebraic Equation: ‘Men, X-O’

Coach Lee McLaughlin doesn’t
profess to be a math teacher, but
some simple algebra-like drills in
defense have equalled success for
Washington and Lee’s football team
so far this season.

As in algebra, the problem is
“X”, and if the Generals solve
Coach McLaughlin’s equations cor-
rectly, then “X” always equals zero

or minus yardage.
But for the Generals, finding out

| FOOTBALL AND ALGEBRA—Coach Lee McLaughlin “(left) eile what “X” equals is not as important

W&L’s new “X” defense to Ned Hobbs, Tommy Goodwin, and Chip Day. as getting to where “X” is.

 

Werner, Kavor Lead Lynchburg Scoring As Booters
Fall 7-1; Generals Ready For Wolfpack On Monday

An injury-ridden Washington and
Lee varsity soccer squad registered
its third defeat this past week against
our neighbors from Lynchburg Col-
lege. Hampered by the loss of Co-
captains Dave Knight and Frank
Smith who were injured in the
hard-fought contest against the
North Carolina Tarheels the week
before, the Generals were unable to
contain the impressive scoring com-
bination of Lynchburg’s Werner and
Kavor, and came out on the short

 

Dave Knight in action.

 

end of a 7-1 score.

The Generals became aware of this
powerful one-two punch early in the
first period when tiny Kavor lam-
basted the nets for the game’s initial
tally. This score came minutes after
Werner had powered a drive past the
W&L secondary only to have the
kick miss the crossbar by inches.

This first period proved to be a
scoring one for the Generals also as
the Blue and White forward wall
drove deep into Hornet territory. On
one of these drive plays right wing

» | Charlie Begg set up teammate Steve

Hawkins, and the alert center for-

» | ward headed the ball past the Hor-
#|net goalie for W&L’s first and only
: | tally.

Lynchburg came back moments

| later, and high scoring Helmut “The

Cannon“ Werner registered his first

of two goals for the afternoon. The,

drive somehow had the effect of
deflating the Generals’ aggresive-
ness as the Blue and White bogged
down on several other occasions
during the course of the afternoon.
Lynchburg, however, capitalized on
several scoring opportunities which
were afforded them during the re-

mainder of the contest, and Werner
and Kavor each added one more to
their credit while teammates Rothgot,
Crawford, and Cheeves each found
the range for one goal.

The Generals now sport a 2-3
record for the season. There is a

very good chance, however, that they | @

will get the chance to even this up,
for on Monday Oct. 31, W&L plays
host to the Wolfpack from North
Carolina State.

This game is also being played at
Washington and Lee, and it is the
profund hope of this writer that
some students take enough interest
in the game to make it up to Smith
Field for the contest. It was most
disheartening for our Generals dur-
ing the Lynchburg game to play
before a crowd of a little over 100

Using the familiar slogan of “X
marks the spot” for inspiration, Mc-
Laughlin has worked out his line-
men’s defensive assignments in terms
of getting to pre-determined loca-
tions in the opposition’s backfield be-
fore the play develops. The theory is
that if guard Tommy Goodwin, end
Ned Hobbs, or any other W&L line-
man “gets to X” when the ball is
snapped, then the opponents will get
nowhere on that play.

“Getting to X” has become the
catch-phrase of the W&L defense.
Every lineman has his “X” assign-
ment in every W&L defense, with
with execution varying from play
to play, depending on how the
opposition lines up offensively, Mc-
Laughlin explains.

Assistant Coach Boyd Williams
has adapted an old adage to suit
the “X” defenses. Says he, “He who
hesitates will not get to X.”

McLaughlin emphasizes that “get-

 

ting to X” is the lineman’s first job,
making the tackle is secondary.

“If everybody up front gets to X

first, then linebacker Terry Fohs
will get a clear shot at his ‘X’,” says
McLaughlin.

And where is the Little All-
American candidate’s “X” assign-
ment?

“Oh,” says McLaughlin, “some-

where between the ball carrier’s
knees and his ankles. Or putting it
algebraically,” adds the Generals’
coach, “6X-+-No. 550.”

Students Urged To Vote

Nixon Predicted

Over Kennedy In Mock Ballot

Vice-President Richard M. Nixon
will take a 50 per cent win from
Senator John Kennedy in a mock
election to be held here Monday, a
study made by W&L’s Dr. L. W.
McCloud and his Statistics class re-
vealed today.

A random group of sixty students
was selected by the the school’s
new International Business Machine
(1.B.M.) equipment, and the group
was polled as to their presidential
choice by the Statistics class.

From this data, it was found that
80 per cent plan to vote for Nixon
in the mock election, while only 20
per cent intend to vote for Kennedy.

The majority of the students
polled, Dr. McCloud said, were of
the Episcopal and the Presbyterian
faiths, and their parents were found
to be almost entirely in the upper
income bracket.

Nixon supporters, the survey re-
vealed, were comprised of 55 per cent
from the North and 45 per cent from
the South, while Kennedy’s sup-
porters were 34 per cent from the
North and 66 per cent from the
South.

The accuracy of this prediction that
Nixon will win by this margin is de-
pendent on the fact that all the

Prospects for a good weekend are
high. Vann added to his comments,
saying that Pearce Hardwick and the
vice-presidents of the dance set have
worked hard to make it a most suc-
cessful set and he urged all students
to participate in the university func-
tions and to enjoy the weekend.

The staff of the Ring-tum Phi joins
to wish you a happy, safe, sane and
enjoyable weekend.

Glee Club Sings

(Continued from page 1)

“The opening Te Deum Laudamus
speaks immediately of the vigorous,
triumphant spirit that characterizes
the work, the first theme standing
forward in boldly outlined tonality.

“The Te Ergo section opens with
a soprano solo of striking expres-
siveness.

“The final section...opens with a
statement by the four vocal solo-
ist...then the text is treated again
in a great fugue until the final huge
sonorities of the last pages cap this
estatic expression of one of the
great masters of coral music.”

Last year, the Glee Club sang
The Seasons with the Hollins Col-
lege group. The combined perfor-
mance with the Sullins club con-
tinues this series of performances
with neighboring colleges which has
been spread over the past few years.

In the spring, the W&L Glee Club
is planning to present the Four Way
Requiem with the Longwood Col-
lege Glee Club.

students polled will vote in Mon-

David Goller, news director of
Home Edition, urged students to be
sure to vote. He said that only if a
large percentage of the student body
participated, would the election be a
true reflection of the student opin-
ion.

“Many students are always criticiz-
ing the nation for having only 60
per cent turnout in an election; now
is the time for the students to see
if they can do better.” Goller said.

The polls will open at 8:25 am.

I think), is a compelling race, as well
as a search. A race must be run
rightly, but we are not even run-

We drink, we go to class, we pick
on the House Mother because of

really want to vote to change? Do
we go out to try to change the

W&L when we play Sewanee? (I
do not, for one.) But my brother
cheers for his Sewanee squad.

Everything depends on the circum-
