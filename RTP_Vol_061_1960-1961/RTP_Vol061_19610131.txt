Russian Prof.

IRW Speaker

Dr. Abraham Kreusler, chairman |
of the Department of Russian Studies ,
at Randolph-Macon Women’s Col-'
lege, will be the third speaker in’
Washington and Lee’s seventh annual |
International Relations Week, be-'
ginning one week from today. Pro-|

Dr. Kreusler,
|

fessor Kreusler joins the Honorable’

Norman Thomas, distinguished so-
cialist leader, and Professor Malcolm
Moos of Johns Hopkins University,
recently speech writer to President
Eisenhower, who have been an-
nounced previously as featured lec-
turers in this program.

Professor Kreusler is a native of
the Western Ukraine and holds a
doctorial degree from the University
of Cracow (Poland). He came to the
United States in 1947 and joined the
faculty at Randolph-Macon in 1948,
after a year’s post-doctoral study at
!Columbia University. He gained his
American citizenship in 1954. At
Randolph-Macon he teaches courses
in Russian history, Russian literature,
and the Russian language. Resemb-
ling Premier Krushchev somewhat in
appearance, he has been described
by a colleague as “cherubic in per-
sonality but intellectually tough.”

He will lecture in Lee Chapel on
the evening of Thursday, Feb. 9, on
Some Post-Stalinist Developments
in Russia and Their Implications for
the West. It is his thesis that the
Russian government is under great
pressure internally to make peace-
ful approaches toward the West and
that this pressure presents the West
with great opportunity for nego-
tiation, directions of which he will
explore in his lecture.

Summer Camp Changed;
ROTC Moves To Ft. Bragg |

General Military Science College |
ROTC units located in Ohio and Vir- |
ginia will exchange training sites for |
their 1961 summer camp training, it
was announced this week at Second
United States Army Headquarters at
Fort George G. Meade, Md.

The ten Ohio colleges and univer-
sities which have been sending their
advanced students to Fort Bragg,
N. C., for the required six weeks!
summer training, will be sent to Fort
Fort Knox, Ky., instead, while the
eight Virginia schools which have
been utilizing Fort Knox for sum-
mer training will be sent to Fort
Bragg.

The change was made to permit
ROTC students to train nearer their
home communities and thus achieve
considerable savings to the Army
in transportation costs. Army ROTC
summer camp training for 1961 will
be conducted during the period of
June 17 to July 28.

The eight Virginia schools that will
train at Fort Bragg this year are:
Virginia Military Institute (Infantry
only) at Lexington, Virginia Poly-
technic Institute at Blacksburg,
Hampton Institute at Hampton, Uni- |
versity of Richmond, Virginia State |
College at Petersburg, University of |
Virginia at Charlottesville, Washing- |
| ton and Lee University at Lexington,

Phillips Publishes Article |
Discussing Landis Report |

The Januery issue of Office Execu- |
tive, a monthly magazine published
by the International Office Manage-

ait een ment Association, contains an article | nar for Students to be held in New

on collective bargaining as excerpted |
from a speech made by Dr. Charles |
F. Phillips, Jr., assistant professor of |
economics at Washington and Lee}
University.

The speech was delivered last year |
to the association’s Roanoke chapter. ,

Dr. Phillips argues in his speech
that for more than half a century
public policy in the United States
has been concerned with equalizing
the power mobilized on opposite sides
of the labor-management bargain-
ing table. Such power is detrimen-
tal to the functioning of a competitive
economy, he points out.

As a solution, Dr. Phillips notes
that public policy must seek to
place restrictions on the size and
power of bargaining units. The meth-
od advocated is to declare industry-
wide collective bargaining as illegal
restraint of trade under our anti-
trust laws.

A member of the Washington and
Lee faculty since 1959, Dr. Phillips
has written articles for five different
economic journals on subjects such
as the synthetic rubber industry,
regulation in a competitive economy,
and fair trade. He received his A.B.
degree from the University of New
Hampshire and his M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees from Harvard University. He
is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.

 

Notices

 

Class rings will go on sale to-
morrow, Wednesday, Feb. 1, in the
Co-op. Sales will run through Sat-
urday, and will run only during
the morning and evening hours.

Quincy Adams Debate Trophy will
be Bill Boardman and Bill Buice.
Boardman, a Beta sophomore, is
currently undefeated in Virginia in-
tercollegiate debating. Buice, an SAE
senior, recently added to his unde-
feated season with a convincing vic-
tory in the Philadelphia meet. This
promising two-man team will de-
bate the resolution: “That the United
| States shall adopt a program of
compulsory health insurance for all
citizens.” During the three days of
matches Buice and Boardman will
face eight opponents in preliminary
rounds. Their performance in these
qualifying debates will determine |
their placement in the four-round,
finals.

Completing the Washington and
Lee entry will be Pete Straub, Sig-
ma Nu senior, and George Birdsong,
SAE senior. Birdsong, who has com-
piled an impressive record in de-
bates this year, will join with Straub,
the veteran of the W&L squad, in
an attempt to bring home the Ed-
ward Everett Oratory Trophy.

Birdsong Picked
As Va. Delegate

George Birdsong, an SAE senior
from Suffolk, Va., has been selected
as Virginia’s delegate to the twelfth
annual Christian Citizenship Semi-

 

 

York and Washington on Feb. 5-11.
Each state will send one delegate.
Birdsong was selected by the Vir-
ginia Methodist student movement
to represent his state.

He has come in contact with this
organization through his work with
the Wesley Foundation and the Uni-
versity Christian Association.

The seminar will meet for four
days in New York where it will
study the United Nation’s work con-
cerning the current African prob-
lem. The group will then travel to the |
Capital to study the U.S. foreign!
policy towards the newly formed
African nations.

Birdsong said that he would have
to do a good deal of outside read-
ing to prepare for the conference.
He added, “I’m looking forward to
ettending the conference very much
since the material covered concerns
an area of major interest to me—
that of international relations.

The convention will open on Sat-
urday, February 5, with an address
from seminar coordinator, Dr. Robert

Sweet Briar Girls
In Musical Cast

For the second consecutive year,
Sweet Briar girls will participate
in the SWMSFC musical. Dave Lef-
kowitz announced today that Sweet
Briar authorities will permit the
girls to audition “subject to minor
revisions in the script.”

Auditions for the female roles will
be held on the Sweet Briar campus
Wednesday, Feb. 8. Chris Christian, a
member of last year’s cast, will
handle the arrangements at Sweet
Briar.

Several rehearsals will be held at
Sweet Briar, as well as at the Troub-
adour Theater. Crane Calder, a well-
known arranger who has worked
with Rogers and Hammerstein in
such Broadway shows as “Flower
Drum Song” and “Carousel,” has of-
fered to help with the Sweet Briar
rehearsals.

Beauty Contest
Open Till Feb. 5

The editor-in-chief of the 1961
Calyx, Ned Ames, announced today
that the deadline for entries in the
Calyx beauty contest has been ex-
tended until Sunday, February 5.

Ames said the extension was made,
from the Feb. 1 deadline, in order
to give more students a chance to
enter pictures.

 

 

To be eligible, a girl must be of
college age. Glossy print pictures,
5x7 inches, may be submitted to
Ned Ames or Ken Beall at the
Delta Tau Delta house on or be-
fore Feb. 5. Included data must
contain the girl’s name, her school,
her age, and her home town.

The student submitting the win-
ning picture will be awarded a free
case of beer.

The Calyx contest is an annual
event, and the reigning beauty is
chosen by a prominent figure. The
Queen and her court are presented
in the beauty section of the Calyx.
In past years, Jack Parr, Steve Al-
len and many other outstanding
personalities have judged the entries.
This year’s judge has been selected
and is one of Hollywoods’ leading
personalities,

Ames told the Ring-tum Phi,
“Progress on the Calyx has been very
good. We hope to have one of the

 

best yearbooks in recent time. And
a wide field from which to chose
the Queen will certainly enhance the |
chance of this being a top-notch

book.”

*with the usual Religious Conference

indirectly means doing away with
the compulsory assembly which had
become traditional.

The seminars will be held in co-
operation with different academic
departments in the university. Future
seminars may deal with the relation
of religion to history, science, sociol-
ogy, psychology, and economics al-
though definite plans for seminars
next year have not been made yet.

The first seminar will be held this
spring on April 5 and 6. The seminar,
entitled “Religion in Contemporary
Literature” will be led by Dr. Wil-
liam R. Mueller, chairman of the
Department of English, Goucher Col-
lege, Baltimore, Md. It will be sup-
ported jointly by the Seminars-on-
Literature Program, the University
Christian Association, and the De-
partment of Religion.

Professor Mueller, a native of Bal-
timore, obtained his A.B. from Prince-
ton in 1939, his M.A. in English from
Harvard in 1941, his Ph.D. in English
from Harvard in 1946, and his M.A.
in religion from Union Theological
Seminary in 1954. He held a Ford
Faculty Fellowship in 1953-54 and
visiting fellowship at Yale during
the same years.

He was an instructor in English
at Williams College from 1946-48,
and an assistant professor at Cali-
fornia in Santa Barbara from 1948-
51. In 1951 he went to the Women’s
College of the University of North
Carolina at Greensboro and served
there as associate professor until
he went to Goucher.

He is considered an authority on
English Renaissance literature, on
the history of Christian Doctrine, and
on the relation of religion to modern
literature. His books include The
Anatomy of Robert Burton’s Eng-
land, That Sovereign Light: Essays
in Honor of Edmund Spenser, Spen-
ser’s Critics, and The Phophetic Voice
in Modern Fiction. The last book is
one in which he shows the applica-
tion of Biblical themes such as suf-
fering, sin, and judgment in the
works of such writers as Faulkner,
Joyce, and Kafka.

Malcolm Brownlee, president of
the University Christian Association
says he is pleased Dr. Mueller can
be here. “He was our first choice
for leader of the seminar, and we
are privileged to get him.” Brownlee
also said that “he not only is one of
the four or five leading authorities
on religion in modern literature but
also is a teacher who knows how to
talk with college students about
topics which are interesting to them.”

Brownlee says that the UCA is
enthusiastic about the new seminar
program. “We felt the old Religious
Emphasis Week left much to be de-
sired. We hope that the seminars
will interest a larger number of
students than the Religious Empha-
sis Week since they will be related
to the different university depart-
ments. Also they will be spread out
over the year, giving a continuing
opportunity for religious discussion
of a variety of topics.”

Professor Mueller will give two
lectures in duPont Hall, will meet
with several classes, and will con-
duct one afternoon seminar. Tickets
for the lectures will be available
from the Department of English and
the Department of Religion.

 

Student Movie Showing

Original documentary and experi-
mental movies produced by Wash-
ington and Lee University students
will be featured at the University
Feb. 6 in the second annual Lexing-
ton Film Review.

The special showing will be held
at 7:30 p.m. in the lecture room of
the Washington and Lee department
of journalism and communications.

Most of the films were produced
last spring by students taking the
second semester journalism course
in the motion picture. Students wrote
their own scripts, photographed and
edited the films and made their own
sound tracks.

The longest film in the review will
be a documentary on the life and

cause a man cannot buy more than

used to symbolize the barter, and a
man gets as much money as he has
produced money’s worth (less capital
investment, etc.) A man’s income,
then, is limited by what he can pro-
duce, and while monetary policies
may temporarily aid or hinder him,
his capacity is what ultimately con-
trolls his income.

is objectionable to the senses.

The efforts of the Interfraternity Council to ‘clean up” have |
failed. The same vague unenforcible rules exist. The same |
pleas for human rights and human dignity have been offered |
with the same results. |

 

The fault lies not with the IFC, but with the individual fra- | .

ternities. No matter how many rules and regulations are passed |
or rejected by the IFC, the fraternities will continue to operate |
on much the same basis. There are always means of avoiding ;
“the rules.” |

The ‘‘clean up” must come from within. Each house must
be willing to give up a few of the most barbarous practices
each year and replace them with constructive activity either in|
the fraternity house or around the community.

The trend in the past years has been toward improvement. |
As each class catches less and less of the traditional “‘hell,’ they |
will, in turn, tend to be more lenient and the whole “hell week”’
tradition will die.

The only other solution to the problem as we see it would |
involve some sort of faculty or administrative action on the |
matter. We hope that such action will not be taken. We trus*

|
|
that it will not be necessary for the administration to take such |

action. We do feel that an administrative ruling on the matter is
inevitable, unless the individual fraternities are willing to take
action or at least empower the IFC to control or restrict the
amount and nature of abuse to which the freshmen may be
subjected.

We do not intend to suggest here that the freshmen be,
allowed to forego a week of strenuous activity prior to initiation |
into the fraternity. We feel that such a week is beneficial in that
it further integrates the freshman into the routine and ritual of
the individual house. A “help” week is more necessary than |
ever as a means of drawing the freshmen and the fraternity

closer together.

Hoogenboom Reflects On Economics;
Production, Not Money, Aids Growth

The thing that is needed to make
the economy grow is more produc-
tive capacity: that is, that each man
can produce more goods with a day’s
work. Then, through his wages, he
can exchange his work for more
goods. This is the only growth that
is possible in an economy. The two
tremendous spurts of growth which
have occurred were the result of
the invention of the machine, with
proper power sources, and the de-
velopment of assembly-line meth-
ods of production. Proper policies
aided in the realization of the pos-
sibilities of these two things, but
when they had been exploited and
refined a new method of increasing
a man’s productive capacity had to
be found, and when found, used.

Automation seems to be the next
step. Greater energy sources are
available, or are imminently avail-
able (i.e., Project Sherwood, con-
trolled nuclear fusion). All that re-

 

mains is to use them. But at every
step of the way powerful forces fight
these advances. Labor unions will
not countenance automation unless
as many men are employed with it

’ | as were without it. The crafts unions

will not permit the use of prefabri-
cated house units. Miners resist in-
troduction of more efficient mechani-
cal devices. It is in this way that our
economy is being stifled, and not
by the Federal Reserve Board.

Here is the “new frontier” largely
| unmentioned in the inaugural hoop-
| la. This is how you make an economy
| grow. This is what the Federal Gov-
| ernment should concern itself with:
| a method by which a gradual transi-
| tion to automation could be made
| without causing the horrible disloca-
| tion which attended the industrial
| revolution.

This is the way to make the econo-
| my grow: stop thinking there’s some-
thing magic about money and start
- producing.

‘Inert Fraternity Council’ Votes Down

Acclaim Hel! Week Proposal Without Good Reason

Let’s not do anything just yet.

abuses that the pledges must under-
go.

By Tom Lybass

Charles McDowell, Jr., a former
columnist and editor of the Ring-
tum Phi, recently had published a
collection of his columns from the
Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch.
The publication of One Thing After
Another, thirteen years after Mc-
Dowell’s graduation from W&L, is
one of the most recent distinctions he
has achieved.

Last year McDowell was named
winner of a Headliner Award “for
outstanding journalism achievement,”
one of 24 such awards made by the
National Headliner Club at the club’s
annual luncheon in Atlantic City,
New Jersey.

In the spring of 1959, McDowell
received the Distinguished Service
Award at the Southern Interscholas-
tic Press Association’s 13th conven-
tion at W&L. The citation commend-
ed his work at SIPA meetings and
his willingness to assist young peo-

ple.
McDowell, whose association with
newspapers began at W&lL, has

worked for the Richmond Times-
Dispatch since 1949. During that
time, he covered such outstanding
news events as the national political
conventions of 1952, 1956, and 1960,
the Senate fillibuster of March, 1960,
and Krushchev’s tour of America.
Newsman McDowell broke the
most revealing story of 1952 at the
GOP National Nominating Conven-
tion. At a Chicago hotel where the
Eisenhower and Taft factions were
arguing over the contested state del-
egations, McDowell, prowling back-

a change is going to be voted down.

The cheirman of the IFC has tra-
ditionally supported various progres-
sive measures. In influencing the
IFC to vote for these measures,
however, his hands have been tied.

Face the Facts

Let’s face it: the average student
gets a hell of a kick out of watch-
ing a freshman squirm. The fresh-
man is helpless; if he wants to be
initiated, he’s got to endure all
sorts of indignities. He’s got to
wallow in hog intestines, or drink
detergent, or have eggs dropped
down his throat. He’s got to wear
week-old liver next to his body,
or swallow an oyster on a string.

And while the freshman is being
put through his paces like a witless
cur, he’s vowing that he’ll really
make it rough on the pledges next
year.

“This is the way the Marines make
men,” we’re told; and “this is noth-
ing compared to the Hell Week of
former years.” I would suggest that
W&L is supposed to be turning out
gentlemen, not leathernecks. And as
for the good old days, well—this
school has advanced a long way since
then.

Right To Complain

If any freshmen feel that they are
being forced to undergo a physical
or emotional hazard, they have a
legitimate right to complain. The
cowards are those who keep silent.

This year the chairman of the IFC
will be paying special attention to
the hazing practices that occur. On
specific cases of abuse, he will prob-
ably have the support of the IFC’s
Judicial Committee, which is com-
posed of house presidents.

The Solution

The solution will not be found in
a rash of accusations and penalties,
however. The solution will be for a
few fraternity officers to decide to
offer the pledges, their brothers-to-
be, something more substantial than
eggs and tabasco. Something, per-
haps, like sandpaper and paint—ap-
plied manually rather than orally,

Cagers Lose McDowell

Team’s Strength
Affected By Loss

Good and bad news were combined
with the usual second semester en-
thusiasm as Coach Bob McHenry and
the basketball team began prepara- bs
tions yesterday for the coming slate r
of games.

Briefly the bad news is that John
McDowell, freshman and starting
center for the quintet has been
dropped from school through fail-
ure to meet academic require-
ments. On the brighter side there
are a few things to look forward
to. Brett Thackston, feared lost
from the team because of grades,
is eligible to continue playing and
will play in the remaining games.
In addition, Ken Kowalski, who
has had a severe knee injury in the
last few weeks will see more ac-
tion and should be ready for the
first game this coming Saturday.

McDowell’s loss will be very| %
great to the team which has counted | —
on his rebounding strength all sea-|
son, and his 8.6 scoring average has| .~
been a big help on the scoreboard.
Although he was only a freshman,

certainly been a tremendous help
to the Generals and even more im-
portant then that he had been count-
ed on for the next three years.

His loss will certainly put even
more pressure on the Generals who
were just getting up some steam as
exams were beginning. Coach Mc-
Henry has no plans to make any
great changes at present and has
stated that he will definitely not
bring up any of the boys from the
freshman team.

One minor change will be a new
offense which will be inserted to be
used at various times during a game.
It is a 3-2 offense with three men

is that Washington and Lee’s main
weakness is its lack of rebounding

enable his players to drive more for
the basket.

The agenda for the next few
weeks slates Washington and Lee
against three tough opponents. This
Saturday, the Generals will meet
Hampden-Sydney at the Tigers’
home court. Although we were vic-
torious in the last encounter with
this team by a comfortable margin,
the Tigers have since then beaten
Randolph-Macon on their home
court. Then, next Tuesday the Gen-
erals will face Randolph-Macon
here. Randolph-Macon is in Coach
McHenry’s estimation, “the best
team in the state of Virginia.” The

We of the Tuesday Edition would like to echo the Friday

Edition’s praise of Coach Lee McLaughlin for the honor ac-
corded him as Virginia Coach of the Year. In the four years
that Coach Mac has been here, he has not only produced a
winning team out of the depths of mediocrity but has won the
admiration and esteem of the faculty and student body. We
feel that as a coach and a man, Coach Lee McLaughlin justly

deserves the honor of Coach of

Rifle Team Lacks Polish;
Instructor Seeks Range

The W&L rifle team has a
match scheduled for next Monday |
against Wake Forest, on the VMI
range. So far, in defeating William |
& Mary and losing to Richmond, the |
team has averaged 1370 points out!
of a possible 1500. This may seem |
good until one considers that Fish-
burne Military School shot a 1406
total in defeating the W&L freshman
team. What’s wrong? Sergeant John
Matthews, team coach, attributes a
lot of this to lack of practice. At
present, the team uses the VMI
range about two hours every day,
and two nights a week, but our
neighbors down the street have
their own commitments, so it’s not
always possible for the team mem-
bers to get enough practice. The
sergeant has five good shooters, and
ten more capable of being equally as
good, with practice, but there’s no
place for them to work.

Loves of Dobie Gillis’, etc.)

HOW SMALL CAN YOU GET?

Today let us address ourselves to a question that has long rocked
and roiled the academic world: Is a student better off at a
small college than at a large college?

To answer this question it is necessary first to define terms.
What, exactly, do we mean by a small college? Well sir, some say
that in order to be called truly small, a college should have an
enrollment of not more than four students.

I certainly have no quarrel with this statement; a four-
student college must unquestionably be called small. Indeed,
one could even call it intime if one knew what intime meant.
But I submit there is such a thing as being too small. Take, for
instance, a recent unfortunate occurrence at Crimscott Aand M.

Crimscott A and M, situated in a pleasant valley nestled
between Denver and Baltimore, was founded by A. and M.
Crimscott, two brothers who left Ireland in 1706 to escape the
potato famine of 1841. As a result of their foresight, the Crim-
scott brothers never went without potatoes for one single day of
their lives—and mighty grateful they were! One night, full of
gratitude after a hearty meal of French fries, cottage fries, hash
browns, and au gratin, they decided to show their appreciation
to this bountiful land of potatoes by endowing a college. They
stipulated that enrollment should never exceed four students
because they felt that only by keeping the college this small

 

WS do

could each student be assured of the personalized attention, the
camaraderie, the feeling of belonging, that is all too often lacking
in higher education.

Well sir, things went along swimmingly until one Saturday a
few years ago. On this day Crimscott had a football game
scheduled against Minnesota, its traditional rival. Football was,
of course, something of a problem at Crimscott, what with only
four students enrolled in the entire college. It was easy enough
to muster a backfield, but finding a good line—or even a bad
line—baffled the most resourceful coaching minds in the country.

Well sir, on the morning of the big game against Minnesota,
its traditional rival, a capricious destiny dealt Crimscott a cruel
blow—in fact, four cruel blows. Sigafoos, the quarterback,
woke up that morning with the breakbone fever. Wrichards, the
slotback, was unable to start his motorcycle. Beerbohm-Tree,
the wingback-tailback, got his necktie caught in his espresso
machine. Langerhans, the fullback, was stolen by gypsies.

Consequently, alas, none of the Crimscott team showed up at
the game, and Minnesota, its traditional rival, was able to score
almost at will. Crimscott was so out of sorts that they immedi-
ately broke off football relations with Minnesota, its traditional
rival. This later became known as the Dred Scott Decision.

So you can see how only four students might be too small an

enrollment. The number I personally favor is twenty. How
come? Because when you have twenty students and one of
them opens a pack of Marlboro Cigarettes, there are enough to
go around for everybody, and no one has to be deprived of
Marlboro’s fine, mild flavor, of Marlboro’s easy-drawing filter,

of Marlboro’s joy and zest and steadfast companionship, and

as a result you have a student body that is filled with sweet

content and amity and harmony and concord and togetherness

ind soft pack and flip-top box.
That’s how come.

University Receives $1,500
In Shell Company Grant

The Shell Oil Company has select-
ed Washington and Lee University
to share in its program of “Shell
Assists” to higher education for the
second consecutive year.

President Fred C. Cole announced
receipt of the Shell gift of $1,500,
which includes $500 of unrestricted
funds, $500 for general faculty de-
velopment and $500 for professional
development of individual faculty
members in engineering, mathematics
and the physical sciences.
Washington and Lee is one of
nearly 100 private colleges and uni-
versities sharing $150,000 in Shell
Assists for 1961.

“The cummulative effect of the
Shell Assists program is of great
significance to private higher edu-
cation,” President Cole said. “Wash-
ington and Lee is most grateful for
this additional support from one of
our leading corporations.”

Many outstanding events will take
place during the Spring term on
the W&L campus. To mention only
a few: International Relations Week,
The Phi Beta Kappa assembly, ODK
selections, the SIPA convention, ten-
nis, lacrosse, baseball, intramural
events, and Spring and Final dances.
These and many other events are
covered by and preserved in the two
weekly editions of the Ring-tum
Phi.

Realizing how hard it is for us,
here at school, to keep those at home
informed, the Ring-tum Phi would
like to offer a special rate of $2.50
for the balance of the semester in
order that parents friends, alumni,
and any incoming freshmen may be
kept in closer contact with the
school.

We would encourage you to send
in your subscription as soon as pos-
sible in order that all the second
semester issues be sent. We will be
glad to include back issues as long
as they hold out. Everyone certainly
should spend 10 cents an issue to
keep his parents and others informed
on the school.

The attached form may be filled
out and mailed to Box 899, Lexing-
ton, Va., or it may be given to either
Huntly Biggs—SAE or Peter Age-
lasto—Phi Kappa Psi. The payment
of $2.50 may be made now or a
