IFC Turns Down New Help Week Plan

 

Dr. Gaines Praises Gen. Lee’s

Work To Reunify United States

By STEVE HENRY

Washington and Lee University Chancellor Francis P.
Gaines opened the National Civil War Centennial Commem-
oration in Lee Chapel Sunday, saying that Robert E. Lee of-
fered the South a new version of hope during a period when the
by-word in the naton was “‘chaotic confusion.”

Dr. Gaines, introduced by Virginia Congressman William

 

*
M. Tuck as a “man who represents”

to the highest degree the principles
of Lee,” said that the Confederate
commander’s part in the re-uniting
of the country “cannot be estimated.”

“With complete charity and pa-
tience, Lee healed his _ people’s
wounds,” said Gaines.

“Even though he lost everything,
there were no ‘might have beens’ of-
fered, no bitterness, no resentment.

“Lee personally opened the doors
of tomorrow to the gifted and united
youth of the South.”

Gaines’ speech, which received
wide-spread radio and_ television
coverage, coincided with a similar
ceremony held in New York at the
tomb of Ulysses S. Grant.

The program here at Washington
and Lee was arranged largely
through the efforts of Dr. William
Bean, head of the History Depart-
ment. Included in the ceremony were
The Rt. Rev. Lloyd Craighill, re-
tired Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese
of Anking, China, Virgil Carrington
Jones, presiding member of the
National Civil War Centennial Com-
mission, Congressman William M.
Tuck of Virginia, who is vice chair-
man of the National Commission,
and Mrs. Robert Bacham, president-
general of the UDC.

The following is the complete
text of Dr. Gaines Speech.

The little town of Lexington, in
which these exercises are held, has
been called “The Shrine of the
South.” Here General Jackson lived
and here he is buried. Here Commo-
dore Maury lived and died. Here
General Pendleton, Chief of Artil-
lery for the Army of Northern Vir-
ginia, came, to take off the uniform of
war and put on the uniform of God
while he served as rector of our
Episcopal church. There is much af-
fection and there is some accuracy
in the term, “Shrine of the South.”

Yet when we think of General Lee,
who gave the five post-war years of
his life to a college located in this
community, we realize that our town
might justly be known as “The
Shrine of a Reunited Country.” The
role that Lee played in the drama of
reunion cannot be over-estimated.
He, perhaps more than any other
person, could have kept open the
wounds of war. Instead, with com-
plete charity and patience, he sought
to heal.

In some essential ways, he had lost
more than any other person. He lost,
of course, his property, his position,

his income, his profession. He sur-|

rendered an army in the open field,
and thus lost a war; there was no
hope of any kind after Lee had quit.
He even lost citizenship and was to
die simply a paroled prisoner of war.

But he closed resolutely every door
of yesterday. He offered no apology
and attempted no explanation. He
proposed no hypothesis of what
might have been. His devoutly
Christian soul rejected all bitterness
and harbored no resentment. He
busied himself about opening the
doors of tomorrow and for a reunit-
ed country. If he had a slogan, it was
a simple but an eloquent one: “We
are all Americans now.” The beauti-
ful dream of reconciliation flowered
first in the capacious soul of Robert
E. Lee. And here on this campus the
first fair fruits were seen.

After all, I venture to emphasize
the part General Lee played in re-
union not so much for what he did,
important as that chronicle may be,
but for the power of his example. It
was more difficult for the South to
enter into the spirit of accepance
and renewal. It lost the struggle. Its
economy was devastated. Since most
of the war was fought on Southern
soil, the destruction of war wrote
in hideous terms the loss of South-
ern property. And in gentle truth it
may be added that while the pall of
tragedy lay heavily on both sections,
it was perhaps darker in the South
with the sad awareness that the all

Troubs To Give
Pirandello Play

In Spring Series *

Auditions for the forthcoming |
Troubadour productions are to be|
held at the theater tonight, 7:30-9:30. |
The play is Luigi Pirandello’s Henry |
IV, with the cast consisting of elev- |
en male and two female parts.

A three-act serious drama, Henry
IV has its setting in contemporary
Italy. The title role is portrayed as an
eccentric, who has developed the il-
lusion that he is Henry IV, an elev-
enth century emperor of Germany.

Charles di Nolli, the nephew of
“Henry IV,” takes charge of the
household and humors his uncle by
permitting a royal court to be set up.
To complete the setting, he hires a
crew of four to act as the “private
counsellors of the emperor.”

Also appearing on the scene are
Baron Tito Belcredi, a cynic and
lover of Henry’s ex-sweetheart, and
Dr. Genoni, a psychiatrist employed
to investigate Henry’s case history.
The two female characters are the
Marchioness, the middle-aged ex-
sweetheart of Henry, and her young
daughter Frieda.

Pirandello, one of today’s most
prominent Italian playwrights, has
written the play as somewhat of a
tragedy, evoking some _ interesting
ideas about the closeness of reality
and illusion. “It shows how every
one must harbor some degree of il-
lusion just to keep his sanity,” com-
ments Dr. Cecil Jones, who will di-
rect the play.

Rehearsals will begin at the start
of the second semester and the pro-
duction is planned for the evenings
of March 8, 9, and 10.

Costume Sales
Hit 400 Mark

Tomorrow will be the last day for
the sale of Fancy Dress costumes.
Mrs. Arlene Stover reports that more
than 400 costumes have already been
sold. |

All students who have not yet
sent in their date’s measurements
are urged to bring them to Mrs.
Stover tomorrow in the Student
Union. Those students who order
costumes but do not pick them
up will be charged six dollars.

 

 

The costumes will be delivered |
to school by Friday, January 28, |
when students will be able to pick|
them up in the Student Union. Stu- |
dents pay for the costumes when
they pick them up.

Mrs. Stover says that the costume |
company in Massachusetts, with)
which we are dealing, told her that
the costumes for the figure were |
among the most magnificent that |
they had ever seen. She also said |
that she expected the other costumes
to be far better than in recent years.

 

Frank Hoss To Head PAD;
Lemmon Is Vice- Justice

Frank A. Hoss, law senior from
Manassas, Virginia, was eiected on
Friday to the office of Justice of the
Phi Alpha Delta law fraternity. Hoss
is a graduate of Washington and Lee
University, where he was active in
sports during his four years as an
undergraduate. He has been active in
all phases of law school activities,
including the Law Review, Moot
Court competition, and fraternity
functions.

Other officers elected at Friday’s
meeting were Junius (Phyz) Lem-
mon, Vice-Justice; Jim Howe, sec-
retary; Joe Spivey, treasurer; and
Andrew McThenia, Marshal.

Rhodes Aid

W&L Representative Fares Well
In ’61 Rhodes Grant Competition

By HAL McCLANAHAN

“To me, W&L was extremely well-
represented in the Rhodes Scholar-
ship competition this year.” These
are the words used by Dr. Fitzgerald
Flournoy, Chairman of the Rhodes
Scholarship Committee of W&L, to
describe the five students from W&L
entering the Scholarship contest this
year.

Nathan Simpson was one of the
two students chosen to represent
Florida in the District Three finals
in Atlanta, Georgia, as well as the
only one of W&L’s five students to
make the district finals in the Rhodes
Scholarship competition.

The other students from W&L
that entered the Rhodes competi-
tion this year are Palmer Pard-
ington, Roy Carpenter, Henry Har-

rell, and Kent Frazier. The above |

mentioned students competed in
Louisiana, Virginia, and Florida
respectively.

Thirty - two Scholarships are
awarded annually in the eight dis-
tricts of six or seven states of the
U.S.A. Each district has a Commit-
tee of Selection, which chooses two
students from the state’s applicants
to go before the District Committee,

| which will award Scholarships to

four of the 12 or 14 boys in the dis-
trict race.

Dr. Flournoy, a Rhodes scholar
himself, mentioned the fact that the
committees, which are composed of
four Rhodes scholars and another
prominent man, consider a student’s
academic record, his capacity for
leadership or service, his participa-
tion in outdoor sports, not necessar-
ily intercollegiate athletics, and
above all, the student’s character.
Also mentioned was the fact that
financial need was not a special claim
for a scholarship.

Each applicant is reviewed by
the respective committees in oral
interviews in which the student is
quizzed with questions ranging
from his personal views on poli-
tics, foreign affairs and religion on
down to his academic life, all of
which are designed to give the
committee an insight into the stu-
dent’s character and his knowledge
of what his major will be.

 

Simpson, a senior and Cadet Col-
onel of the W&L ROTC Battle,
Group, said that the state interview |
in Tampa, Florida, lasted for about |
thirty minutes and that the district |
competition consisted of two inter-
views, an informal after-dinner con-
versation in the Capital City Club!
in Atlanta and another 45 minute |
question-and-answer period at Em-
ory Univ. He had the following to
say about the entire contest: “Need-
less to say, competition in the dis-
trict was much greater than in =
state. I also felt that the boys in the
district competition were more ma-
ture than those on the state level,
ranging from the well-rounded in-|
dividual to the highly intellectual
person.” Simpson also mentioned |
that such schools as _ Davidson,
Sewanee, Princeton, VMI, and West

 

 

 

Point were represented.

The Rhodes Scholarships, which
carry an annual stipend of $2100,
enable a student to take a degree in
two years with the possible grant
of a third year of study. To be eli-
gible for the Scholarships, a per-
son must be a male citizen of the
United States with five years’ resi-
dence and unmarried, between the
ages of 18 and 24 before October Ist
in the year he applies, and have a
Junior standing in some recognized,
degree-granting college or Univer-
sity in the United States. A Rhode
scholar may read for a B.A. degree
in subjects ranging from empirical
sciences to humanities to languages.
If he is qualified, the student may
read for an Advanced Degree such
as the B.Phil., B.Sc., B.Litt. B.C.L.,
or D.Phil.

 

At Historical Society Convention

By BILL SMITH, JR. |

New York’s Statler Hilton Hotel |
was the site of the annual meeting |
of the American Historical Associa- |
tion last month as some of the coun-
try’s foremost historians convened |
for a three day session, on the twen- |
ty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirti-
eth of December. This is an associa-
tion recognized as containing the
outstanding men in their field, in
the United States.

Attending on behalf of Washington |
and Lee were several professors!
from the History Department: Dr.
William A. Jenks, Dr. Ollinger Cren- |
shaw, Dr. Thomas P. Hughes, Dr. |
Charles W. Turner, and Dr. Leon F. |
Sensabaugh.

Among the prominent men there, |
in addition to the Washington and
Lee men, were Mrs. Francis Perkins,
former Secretary of Labor under |
Roosevelt's administration; Mc- |
George Bundy, present Dean of |
Harvard, and newly appointed to
Mr. Kennedy’s administration; |
Jaques Barzun, Dean of the gradu-
ate school at Columbia; and Lewis
Mumford, an internationally known
author, architect, and sociologist.

At the same hotel, and in con-|

junction with each other were other
historical society meetings, among
them the Agricultural Historical So-
ciety, the Railroad Historical Society,
and the Catholic Historical Society.

Members of the association broke
up into their respective fields and
heard papers and discussions given

| purposed to bring up to date the
| thought in that particular field. The

society members were privileged to/
, hear
| and Dr. Hughes.

papers from both Dr. Jenks

Dr, Jenks paper was entitled “The
Impact of Pan-Germanism on Cen-
tral Europe.” The thesis of his ideas
was that Pan-Germanism was weak
in Austria in 1914, and that most of
the German-Austrians favored the

| Hapsburg monarchy rather than a

union of the Germanies.

“Early Years of Electrical Indus-
try: A Study of the Interelation of
Politics and Economics” was the top-
ic of Dr. Hughes’ paper. He brought

forth the thought that in the 1880’s |

Great Britain was the leading indus-
trial nation of the world, but shortly
after this time, she fell behind the
United States in this important sect-
or of the economy. It appears that
this decline stemmed not so much

Inspection Proposal Fails
To Pass Fraternities

By RICHARD CRUSE

The LF.C. positive and negative
proposals regarding stricter regula-
tions during Hell Week were crushed
last night at the LF.C. meeting in the
Student Union. These proposals that
would have substituted Help for Hell
in Hell Week were defeated by a vote
of eight to six.

At the beginning of this year, two
ILF.C. committees were set up to
study problems related to Hell Week.
One of these committees was to
study the negative aspect of Hell
Week and the other was to offer sug-
gestions as to positive ways that
fraternity pledges could occupy
themselves during Hell Week.

After the reports were presented at
last night’s meeting, the motion was
made and seconded that the reports
be accepted by the ILF.C.; further,
that they be mimeographed and cop-
ies distributed to fraternities and
other interested parties; and finally
that a committee of the LF.C. be set
up to assure that the suggestions of
these committees be enforced. The
apparent reason for the failure of the
proposals to pass was the inclusion
of the regulatory committee with the
knowledge that this committee would
function during Hell Week.

Dave Lefkowitz, President of the
LF.C., said, “I hope that fraternities
realize that according to present and
long standing regulations certain
pledging activities are strictly for-
bidden during Hell Week.

According to present rules:

A. No fraternities should vio-
late the principles of good

taste.

B. No initiation or pledge
training should constitute
any physical or emotional
hazard to the individual
pledge.

The judiciary committee will deal
severely with any houses that break
these rules during the February Hell
Week. This committee wishes it
made known that the failure of the
above motion will necessitate a
strengthening of its power. It will
be ready to deal with any infraction
of the standing rules during Hell
Week.

The text of the two rejected re-
ports appears below.

Negative Committee Report

Under the present fraternity sys-
tem at Washington and Lee, the fra-
ternities each year plan a concentrat-
ed program of activities for their
pledges during the first week of the
second semester. It is our belief that
such a week of activities should con-
tinue to exist.

During this week, several valuable
ends are served. First, pledges, be-
ing engaged in a common field of
strenuous activity, develop a sense of
unity among themselves. Second,
they develop a stronger attachment
to the fraternity in laboring for it.

| Third, by obeying orders from up-

Facuity M embers Deliver Papers

perclassmen, they are reminded of
their junior position in the fraternity,
and develop respect for the author-
ity of the fraternity as a whole.

We maintain, however, that no
pledge can increase in his respect of
any individual or group of individ-
uals which forces him to perform
deeds that violate his basic sense of
human dignity and decency.

Moreover, we believe that no good
ends are served by submitting the
pledge to physical pain or prolonged
discomfort. By the same _ token,
schemes to cause mental or emotion-
al anguish are also undesirable.

Instead, we hold that the highest
purpose of this Help Week can be
fulfilled by occupying the pledges

| with constructive projects and ac-
| tivities that will test their capacity

for resourcefulness and teamwork,
without debasing them by the prac-
tices listed previously.

Included in this Negative Commit-
tee report was the plan for an LF.C.
regulatory committee which was to
go from house to house to inspect
prevailing conditions. This was the
part of the proposal which Lefkowitz
feels was most important in the mea-
sure’s defeat.

Report of Positive Committee
Program:

I. The Committee would advocate
such practices as calisthenics, inter-
pledge class athletic competition, re-

| lay races, scavenger hunts, and good,

Centennial Purpose

The Civil War service held in Lee Chapel Sunday to
kickoff the Civil War Centennial at Washington and Lee was
quite impressive. Dr. Bean had evidently done an excellent
job of planning for a program which included The Rt. Rev.
Lloyd R. Craighill, retired bishop of the Episcopal Diocces of
Anking, China, Virgil Carrington Jones, the presiding member
of the National Civil War Centennial Commission, present
congressman and past governor of Virginia William M. Tuck,
who is vice chairman of the same commission, Dr. Francis P.
Gaines, our own chancellor and Mrs. Robert Bacham, president-

general of the UDC.

The audience included a number of UDC representatives
from around the Richmond-Lynchburg-Roanoke axis, a quite
impressive group of bewhiskered men clad in “The Grey” along
with a number of interested onlookers from the campus and
the town. It was unfortunate that more of the faculty and the
student body were unable to be present at the ceremony which
honored one of our greatest and most esteemed presidents.

A note at the bottom of the program stated; ‘‘A similar
program is scheduled for 2:00 p.m. today at the tomb of Gen-
eral Ulysses S. Grant in New York City. These simultaneous
ceremonies mark the official opening of the five-year Civil War
Centennial as declared earlier today in a proclamation by Presi-
dent Dwight D. Eisenhower.”’ So we see that the Centennial
Celebration is a national affair and has certainly received na-
tional recognition.

The centennial fever is running high throughout the
country; so high in fact, that this sentence found its way into
an announcement in Manteo, North Carolina. The announce-
ment comes from Outer Banks. The statement reads as follows:
“The Battle of Roanoke Island was the major victory for
the Union forces during the Civil War.” Read ye tourists and

weep,
*

One of the avowed purposes of the Centennial is to pro-
mote unity. It is rather ironic that its opening day should come
during a time when the South is being scalped in Congress
and is torn and seathing internally due to the segregation con-
flict which is being rammed down her throat by organizations
which were organized and which, until now, have seen fit to
operate in the northern sections of our country.

The rest of the nation is shaking the finger of admonition
at a section which is all but forgotten on the national political
level save for her stubborn resistance to the civil rights legisla-
tion which both of the major political parties seem determined
to force upon her. The South has become the whipping boy of
the national courts, the national legislature and national pub-
lic opinion because of the “‘example which she offers to the rest
of the free world and the undeveloped countries for whose sup-
port the U.S. is waging the cold war.”

At present, sectional feeling in the South and especially in
the Lower South is growing. The South is on the defensive, and
the agressive forces are in persuit. Soon, she will have nowhere
else to go. She feels that she must stand, and yet knows that she
cannot.

Whether or not this great centennial celebration will be
able to promote unity under these circumstances is a moot ques-
tion. It does not seem likely that the commemoration of an
unsuccessful war which was fought over some of the same
questions which plague the internal unity of the nation today
will do a great deal to smooth over the wounds inflicted upon
the pride and prejudice of the South since 1954.

Revision Needed

We would like to join with the Friday Edition in their
plea for a revised grading system. The present system simply
does not give an accurate indication of student effort and
achievement, and while grades are not paramount, they cer-
tainly have a great deal to do with the future scholastic fortunes
of the student as far as applications for graduate school are con-
cerned,

A revised system similar to that which was outlined by Mr.
Goodwin in Friday’s paper would surely be a marked improve-
ment.

YOP Seminar
Finds Freud In
Mother Goose

By ED WEBSTER

“Needless to say,” Geoffrey was
saying, “Little Jack Horner is the
classic example of human vanity
and complacency.”

“On the contrary,” Cyril replied,
dissolving a candy cigarette between
his molars, “the poem has deeper
implications. Quite Freudian, almost.
The act of puncturing the pie-crust,
for example...”

“Now really, gentlemen,” inter-
jected Cassandra, “don’t you see that
this poem is merely a subtle protest
against the irresponsibility of the
aristocracy? Horner represents a
landed lord, whose vision is narrowed
because he is in a corner, and whose
insatiable appetite is fed by the fruits
of other men’s labors.”

 

This was the weekly seminar
of the YOP (Young Offspring of
Professors), held in the back room
of High’s Ice Cream Store. Geoffrey
sent out for another double vanilla
cone, and resumed his argument.

smugness are seen in many other

Co-ed Aspects Of Hollins-W &L,
Local Date Problems Discussed

By HARVEY ALLEN

Since we got such overwhelming
reaction to our earlier efforts to ex-
pose the Hollins Gestapo, perhaps
the time is ripe once again to cast
another casual glance in the direction
of the Star City, formerly named
Big Lick, Virginia.

We might mention in passing that
our story on the gestapo at Hollins
received such notice that it was re-
printed in complete form in a follow-
ing edition of the Hollins Columns.
The enterprising editor of said jour-
nal even took the opportunity ot
comment editorially on the bit, but
generally missed the point of the
column.

Her main comment worthy of
note around her was something
about people in glass houses not
throwing stones. Can it be that she
suspects that we have some aspect
of our Honor System that needs

revision or review? Goodness.

Checking over a recent issue of
the Hollins Columns we noticed a
story written from an interview with
one of the chief leaf-rakers at
aforementioned riding academy for
young ladies.

The headline mentioned that the
man remembered when Hollins was
co-ed. That’s fine. The only problem
that followed was that the only thing
that touched on the headline was the
comment, “He even remembered
when Hollins was coeducational.”

My reason for bringing this
whole thing up is that at some time
in. our past, we came within one
vote on the Board of Trustees of
becoming co-ed ourselves.

Maybe the S.LP.A. meetings that
year were sufficiently outstanding to
encourage the students here to ad-
vocate a continuation of female

 

faces and figures on the hill. Maybe

Exams, Conversation, Art Show
Cause Post-Holiday Excitement

Turkey stuffings, Christmas gifts,
and general holiday cheer appear to
have injected a new lease on W&L
student life. Whatever the stimu-
lant might have consisted of, the
injection given was widespread
enough that we feel it permeating
the campus.

We feared, upon leaving the school
in December, that we would return
only to encounter the same worn
topics of discussion emitting from the
same sad, apathetic souls. Much to
our surprise a new vitalism, an op-
eration consisting mainly in getting
off one’s bottom, has made an en-
trance. Several pressing subjects
were found here to feed this newly
born disposition.

First, there are the impeding
finals. Finals mean many things to
different people—the range usual-
ly running from “A” students to
“D” students. However, notwith-
standing the grade point ratio
everyone concerned finds himself
confronted with a challenge: finals
can mean keeping that “A,” or
final can mean getting out of the
“D”rut; and in both cases finals
present an anticipated reward, a
sense of accomplishment, if one
succeeds,

In connection with this topic of
term grades, we salute the renewed
proposal to revise the grading sys-
tem at W&L. Any change in this
quarter, we feel, would (from pure
incompleteness of the present sys-
tem) necessarily make the system
more meaningful; and if the instiga-
tion of a new system benefits only
a few, we maintain that the advant-
ages received will be well used in

competing with other educational
institutions after the student has
graduated. This alone is reason
enough for revision.

Secondly, the art show currently
displayed in duPont gallery is worth
a measure of excitement. We judge
this showing the finest we have wit-
nessed at W&L. Anyone not having
seen the forty piece show presented
by one man, Pierre Daura, is recom-
mended to do so for a gratifying
experience. The Fine Arts depart-
ment has well earned an expression
of our gratitude for bringing this
stimulating representative’s works
to our campus.

Finally, as we predicted earlier
this semester, the local movie
houses greeted our return to Lex-
ington with more than average
films. Peter Seller’s “I’m All Right
Jack” is definitely humor at col-
lege level. The State’s presentation
of the film version of the histori-
cal Broadway play, “Sunrise at
Campabello,” has received nothing
but praise from those students who
have seen it.

All in all, the excitement generated
in our surroundings since our re-
turn a week ago gives proof that
the traditional concept of student
life being enticing, inspiring, and
moving has not been lost at Wash-
ington and Lee. During the weeks
immediately preceding the Christmas
holiday we held our doubts. All
doubts dispelled. Our reservation,
however, we must keep: the students
must not allow a redrift into the
paths easily coasted upon with in-
difference and a spirit of anti-
intellectualism.

they just wanted to see some more
skirts, for a change.

If what they say about actions of a
former Board of Trustees is true, we
wonder what happened and who cast
the deciding vote, against more skirts
on campus.

By the way, for the information
lof all those members of this stu-
dent body that have noticed the
large round stones scattered around
the Hollins quad and wondered
why they were there, we can now
announce that the mystery shroud-
ing their origin has at last been
solved.

Seems that they are remenants of
a nearby grist mill. That simple state-
ment shot down all our theories that
they were either specially hewn
stones transported at great expense
to arouse interest and curiosity or
were there serving as weights to
hold the grass, leaves and earth in
place.

Meanwhile, from another neigh-
boring riding academy comes the tip
to those dating there that the word
is to date dorm presidents. Why?
Because it has been observed by
impartial Minks that anyone coming
in late from a date must turn them-
selves in...that is everyone but
dorm presidents. When one W&L
gentleman asked his date about be-

Saturday Evening Post
Calls Cheating a Game
For Faculty and Pupils

By STEVE GALEF

“American Disgrace:
CHEATING”

This is the title of an article in
the recent issue of the Saturday
Evening Post. The author, Jerome
Ellison, tells how cheating has be-
come a game for both students and
faculty members alike.

Reading the article, one can learn
a lot about the ‘game.’ In one ex-
ample Ellison tells about an experi-
ment a teacher set up in a Midwest-
ern university in order to determine
the extent of cheating in his classes.
He gave the class an assignment and
told them there would be a test on
it during the next class period.
When the period came, he gave out
the test, casually announcing that
the answers were on his desk. Dur-
ing the period he was called from
the room.

COLLEGE

In a move that the students
would have considered ‘not play-
ing according to the rules,’ he
had enrolled two graduate students
in the class to report what hap-
pened after he left the room. As the
article reports, the findings ex-
ceeded his original expectations.
As soon as he left the room there
was a mad stampede for the desk.
All but two of the most brilliant
students copied the answers and
later handed them in as their own
effort. There was, no doubt, great
effort involved in getting the an-
swers copied and getting back to
their seats before the professor
came back to the room.

The professor informs us that
Midwestern institutions are not the
only ones where cheating takes place.

 

Yet another interesting example}

War Centennial
Has New Look

Friday Edition, Ring-tum Phi
Washington and Lee University
Lexington, Va.

Dear Bob,

I don’t know if you attended the
Civil War Centennial Ceremonies
today in Lee Chapel, but they would
have made you proud of Washington
and Lee. A courageous group of
W&L men proved that everyone in
this university is not in the nefarious
grip of student apathy and uninvolv-
edness.

We walked down to Lee Chapel
expecting to hear a moderate and in-
spiring speech from Dr. Gaines. We
must admit also we were expecting
to hear a few politicians cast straws
into the wind, trying to judge how
the public wants their oratory this
year. We expected to be joined by a
few other students in more or less
passive participation in this opening
event of the Centennial.

Much to our surprise we espied
a picket line outside the chapel
as we came up the hill from the
parking lot. They were carrying
signs proclaiming things like “No
intersectional warmongering,” or
“Now is the time for pacifism,” or
“The South must join the United
States.” We had no idea what most
of the signs meant but when we
asked a couple of picketers who
they were we found they attended
a number of different schools, all
with a considerably more illus-
trious reputation than W&L.

Further enquery revealed that the
gentlemen and ladies (some from
Randolph-Macon Woman's College)
were members of the National Stu-
dent Association, an enlightened
group which is apparently devoted
to this sort of thing. They have chap-
ters at lots of Eastern and Midwest-
ern colleges, have all sorts of meet-
ings and conferences, and pass lots of
resolutions. For exercise they join
picket lines and sit-ins. I must admit
that I was a little disappointed that
there were no W&L men in the line.
I notice a couple of the more mili-
tant girls were there from Smith.

We swallowed our pride and
walked into the Chapel to hear the
speeches. Much to our surprise,
the air inside was more like Mock
Convention than the solemn and
serious event it was advertised to
be. We began to get uneasy and
thought about retreating. We turn-
ed to go back out of the chapel
when we suddenly found ourselves
under attack from the rear by the
very picketers we had passed out-
side. We were ambushed.

As our eyes began to adjust to the
scene of confusion in the dimly-lit
chapel we saw that another group
had Dr. Gaines and Rep. Tuck cap-
tive and were forcing them to wear
an NSA membership badge and give
the pledge of allegiance of the
NSA. Lest you make a mistake, the
NSA pledge of allegience is not
like the one we all learned in grade
school and that they still say
every Tuesday at Rotary. In fact, the
pledge doesn’t even mention the
United States except a vague ack-
nowledgment of the old U.S. of A.
as our primary place of residence.
It says a great deal about mankind
and rights and implies that anyone
believing all that is more or less
committed to go out and save the
world.

A bunch of the rioters jumped us
and made us say the oath. We did so
without hesitating as several of the
larger rioters were threatening to
throw us into the same fire in which
they were burning effigies of Harry
Byrd and Barry Goldwater. One of
the northerners wanted to burn an
effigy of William F. Buckley, Jr., but
he didn’t get much response from
the W&L men, most of whom were
mumbling, “Who's he?”

Several of the group’s leaders
added comments to the few re-
marks Dr. Gaines had been allowed
to make. Needless to say, his re-
marks were conciliatory in tone
and implied that he thought the
South should join the United
States. He was loudly cheered.
Rep. Tuck had introduced Dr.
Gaines and read an entirely too
statesmanlike telegram sent by his
commission to a descendent of the
notorious U. S. Grant.

Then one of the agents provaca-
teurs shouted, “Don’t just stand
there, let’s go do something about
all this!” And the whole crowd
marched out to the tune of “The
Bittle Hymn of the Republic” to start
a sit-in at the College Inn. They
were carrying Rep. Tuck and Dr.
Gaines on their shoulders last time
we saw them.

We were practically the only people
left in the chapel when the lady who
is president of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy reverently placed
a wreath at the recumbent statue of
General Lee.

Best Always,
BILL ROBERTS

W&L Cagers Defeat Tigers; Lose To Chattanooga

Fauber Stars
For Generals

The highly rated Moccasins of
Chattanooga University were out-
played by the Washington and Lee

Generals, until in the closing seconds #™am

a long jump shot gave them a 70-69
victory.

Although lacking the services of
two first stringers, John Kirk and
Ken Kowalski, the Generals treated
the partisan Doremus Gym audience
to the most thrilling contest of the
year. Brett Thackston played an out-
standing game for the W&L five
especially in the closing minutes
when he stole the ball twice in suc-
cession and contributed several key
baskets.

Washington and Lee jumped to
an early lead and led throughout
the first half. Roger Fauber and
John McDowell were the offensive
standouts for the Generals while
Thackston did a fine job on de-
fense. With the home five on top at
the half it seemed as if the deadly
Moccasins had been overrated.

Unfortunately for the Generals,
Chattanooga was a different ball
club in the second half. The visitors
erased the W&L lead about midway
through the half and from then on,
the Generals had all they could do
to hang on.

Although the victory was not de-

cided until the last five seconds, *
the Generals really lost the game
at the foul line. The Moccasins
who have an exceptionally high
four shot percentage this year
scored almost half of their points

from the charity line.

The Washington and Lee Generals
returned to winning ways Monday
night in Doremus Gym with a 79-67
victory over the Hampden-Sydney
Tigers. Although the Generals made
a poorer showing than Saturday
night against Chattanooga, the Tig-
ers did not present the same calibre
of opposition posed by the Mocca-
sins.

The visitors suffered their tenth
loss of the campaign as against two
wins while W&L boosted its rec-
ord to 3-7. Roger Fauber was high
man for the Generals with 15
points while Hampden-Sydney’s
Hardin was high man for the night
with 16.

The home five got off to a bad start
and it seemed that the absence of
Kirk and Kowalski had left the team
without a great deal of punch. To
the five minute mark, the Generals
had succeeded in scoring only one
basket, but Coach McHenry was able |
to put some life in his players after
a brief time out.

The efforts of Steve Rutledge,
Brett Thackston and Dave Grogan
pushed the Generals out in front
22-16 with nine minutes left in
the first half. Rutledge, who chalk-
ed up 8 points in the first half,
along with center John McDowell
controlled the board for W&L.

 

Baby Generals Beat Massanutten, 88-56

On Saturday, Jan. 7, the freshman
basketball team scored an impressive
88-56 victory over Massanutten Mil-
itary Academy at Massanutten.

With the sharp shooting of stand-
outs Fred Ridolphi and Howard
Martin with 25 and 20 points re-
spectively, the Baby Generals’ fourth
victory was never in doubt as Coach
Joe Lyles was able to empty his
bench.

Going along with the scoring
punch was an excellent floor game
played by Stuart Yoffe and Charlie

 

In the closing minutes of the half,
the Tigers fell behind by eleven
points. Leading 40-29 at the inter-
mission, the Generals seemed to
be in complete control.

Fearing a repeat of Saturday’s sec-
ond half collapse, the home five op-
ened up a 19 point lead before the
midway point in the second half.
Paced by the sharp-shooting of
Fauber and Bill Ide the Generals
built up an almost insurmountable
lead. Coach McHenry substituted

| freely to give some of his reserves

experience while Hampden-Sydney
speeded up the pace in a vain at-
tempt to overtake the Generals. Af-
ter the ten minute mark of the sec-
ond half, rough play and overthrown
passes marred the play of both teams,
but W&L held on to win comfortably
79-67."

court.

Having won four of its seven
games, the team is continuing to
show its potential. The starting five,
consisting of center Howard Martin,
forwards Dave Britt and Yoffe, and
guards Gordon Taylor and Ridolphi,
is being hard pressed by a strong
bench, particularily forwards Steve
Wash and Fred Shaeffer and guard
Charlie Savage.

Coach Lyles remarking on Satur-
day’s victory said: “I was very
pleased at the boys for coming back
so fast after Christmas vacation,
particularly since they had only one
hour practice a day.”

The next game on the schedule
for the frosh is against Bridgewater,

Sports Editorial

NCAA Questioned

For the second straight year, the University of North Caro-
lina has been called up before the Council of the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association to answer the charges leveled at it
by the Council. If the NCAA is not effective in this area of
work, it certainly is persistent.

In carrying out its mission of keeping college athletics scrub-
bed clean, the Council stalks its quarry with a singlessness of
purpose that would be a delight to any Internal Revenue agent.

It makes no distinction between the big and the small and
their related offenses, nor between the winners and the losers.
The same year that the NCAA put Oklahoma on probation for
their violation of recruiting codes, it also put Montana State in
the same position. It is doubtful whether Montana State ever
considered itself in the same class as the Sooners as far as
bowl and post season NCAA tournament and meet appearances
are concerned, but apparently the NCAA did.

The Council will not take no for an answer and a school
which has been hauled before it many times is still in danger
of its censorship until the very last report of hanky-panky has
been investigated. Unlike the Internal Revenue Service, how-
ever, the Council does not recognize a statute of limitations.

Carolina has felt the heavy arm of the association three
times and the Council officials has heard officials, athletic and
academic. But there has never been enough evidence to con-
vict. Yet exoneration does not come lightly. The NCAA has
as its motto, “If at first you don’t succeed .. .’

All this seems to say that while many times the NCAA
does investigate and discover cases of mis-use of recruiting tech-
niques, there are also many times when it conducts an investiga-
tion only for the sake of publicity. This should not be the pur-
pose of an association such as the NCAA, whose principal pur-
pose is to foster the growth of collegiate athletics and to pro-
vide a place to which colleges engaged in athletics can look for
help, instead of censorship. The Association merely defeats its
purpose if it becomes a watchdog.

While it is an acknowledged fact that the abuses in re-
cruiting athletes and keeping an athletic program alive in uni-
versities are great, it should be recognized, too, that under the
present system of subsidized athletics, abuse will be present no
matter how much bush-beating the Assocation does. It is
practically impossible in present day collegiate athletics to have
a winning team, a strong team, and not be guilty of some in-
fraction of the rules which the NCAA has set down.

If a realistic attitude such as this were adopted by the
NCAA, then they would be able to attend to all fields of col:

legate athletics and not be turned into a watchdog organization.

Coach Assesses
Team Progress

We won last night—and it sure
beats losing—on our best offensive
performance of the year. Hampden-
Sydney, like us, is a very young
team. They are also the smallest
team we have faced this year. In
spite of this they have been averag-
ing around 80 points a game with
their run and shoot fast-break of-
fense. We were pleased to beat
them by the 79-67 score.

The boys feel that defense can win
us a lot of games—if we can cut
down on a lot of unnecessary fouls
and continue our aggressive forcing
defense, we can surprise quite a few
of our coming opponents.

In our last two losses to Frank-
lin and Marshall and Chattanooga,
we scored more field goals than they,
but F&M outscored us on the foul
line 22-4, and Chatanooga beat us
there 34-19. In spite of our one point
loss to Chattanooga, I thought it was
our best team effort of the season.

Brett Thackston has _ continued
his fine scoring and Bip Fauber’s
enthusiasm is a spur to the rest of
the team. However, the most im-
proved player in recent games has
been junior Steve Rutledge. His re-
bounding and scoring have both in-
creased, and I feel confident he will
continue to get better with each
game.

 

Tomorrow we face the Bridgewat-
er team that beat us in our opener,
57-50. Again Jim Reedy, who is
averaging 27 points a game, will
be the man to stop. They continue to
use a 2-2-1 zone press and then back
into a 1-3-1 zone.

constructive, physical labor such as
in community projects or house im-
provements. While the above activi-
ties suggest only a few of the possi-
ble undertakings, they tend to il-
lustrate the type of proceedings after
which it is hoped fraternities will
pattern their Help Week activities
acting with discretion between the
boundaries established by the nega-
tive committee and those of good
taste such as are not physically or
mentally harmful or degrading to
one’s personal dignity.

II. Realizing the impossibility of
covering the latitude of desirable
undertakings, the committee would
advocate utilization of pledge class
energies and resources to better
serve the community, university, or
fraternity. It endorses the use of
pledge classes in traditional collec-
tions of charity contributions and
various other drives and urges their
use to serve the community through
any necessary social service work
that need be accomplished upon
community request.

III. In this respect, the committee
proposes that the IFC sponsor a re-
volving trophy to act as a spur to-
ward constructive uses of Help
Week. This trophy, based on service
to the community, university, or fra-
ternity, would be awarded by an
impartial IFC committee to that
pledge class adjudged to have gained
the highest degree of success in its
undertaking. Dean Farrar would act

and the community on one hand and
the fraternities on the other.
Through him would be made known
those worthwhile activities which
fraternities could undertake in pur-
suit of the trophy.

IV. The committee reaffirms the
policies of the negative committee,
endorses the establishment of an
IFC regulatory body to minimize in-
fractions of Help Week regulations
(if such a body were deemed neces-
sary), and urges that fraternities di-
rect their pledge classes to construc-
tive and beneficial ends during Help
Week.

too costly sacrifice had been in vain.

It must be remembered that the
mood of true Southern leadership
was one of chaotic frustration. The
impossible had happened and at best
there was confused bewilderment.
Many of these leaders planned to
flee the country, going they knew not
where.

The dignity of General Lee, his
tireless energy in behalf of tomor-
row, and his faith in the future of
this reunited country, were the
greatest stabilizing elements in that
pathetic little chapter. His influence
was great when he led the armies of
the Confederacy, but his influence
was greater when he led the people
of the Confederacy into a new ver-
sion of hope. And his faith was not
misplaced. We soon were a reunited
country.

Just forty-eight years after that
war closed, Chief Justice Edward
D. White, himself a former Confed-
erate soldier, inaugurated as presi-
dent Woodrow Wilson, a son of a
Confederate soldier. The reunion had
become complete—and perhaps there
is no parallel in the human story.

It is a pleasant act of historical
justical to give praise for reciprocat-
ing acts of generosity on the part of
the North. With pride we remember
General Grant’s magnanimity at the
time of the surrender and we ap-
plaud Mr. Lincoln’s tolerace of de-
clared policy—unfortunately not ef-
fective for some time.

On this campus we record the
helpfulness of those who but recently
were enemies. The first man to come
to General Lee’s aid, as he tried to
rebuild education in the South, was
Cyrus McCormick of Chicago, Vir-
ginia born inventor who sympathized
with the North but responded to

General Lee. Perhaps the most spec-
tacular story of hands across the
border is that of Thomas A. Scott,
then president of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, but formerly assistant sec-
retary of war in Mr. Lincoln’s cabin-
et; he gove $70,000 to this college just
because it was General Lee’s College.
Even Dr. Henry Ward Beacher, the
abolitionist minister of Plymouth
church in Brooklyn, sent General
Lee $1000 as help for his college.

In this centennial year, nobody
wants to open up again the divisive
issues. In the calming perspective of
long time, one fact seems to emerge,
atsonishing if not paradoxical. Both
sides were fighting for what they be-
lieved was freedom. The concept
differed widely but the sincerity of
conviction was one and the same. A
hundred years later, a light shines
upon our own path. Even a bitter
war sustained and enforced the
American tradition of freedom. It is
our heritage; in the purposes of God
may it be our destiny. Along with
other people we shall try to make
freedom triumph over tyranny. In
deep devotion to this cause of free-
dom we shall find our final and com-
plete joy of unity.

same article. The professor informed
the student that he had discovered
the plagiarism and that he was fail-
ing him in the course. This, however,
is not the end of the story.

The student had a strong desire to
graduate and this one failure was
enough to keep him from doing so.
He decided that he would appeal the
failure to a faculty committee. When
his hearing took place, he arrived
with all sorts of character references.
He didn’t deny that he had cheated,
but he did ask that he be let off
since the failure in the course would
keep him from graduating. The fac-
ulty committee ruled in his favor.

The article describes many other
methods of cheating. One of the
most intricate and elaborate took
place at a school where the pro-
fessors wrote the questions on the
board to prevent leaks. One sys-
tem is described where a boy out-
side reads from the board with
the aid of field glasses and then
sends the answers to those in the
classroom by means of hand sig-
nals. The article mentions that
there “must, of course, be a feli-
citous arrangement of buildings
and classrooms to succeed.” May-
be architects should take this into
consideration when they are plan-
ning new buildings.

The article states that the blame
for this cheating lies on both the
students and the faculty. In fact, in
most cases it would have the blame
split equally among the two. It con-
cludes that the best way to prevent
these episodes is for the schools to,
provide some sort of inspired goal |
or lofty set of ideals for the students |
and faculty to defend.

In the midst of all our arguments
about the honor system, let us be
glad that we have one to argue
about.

types are found very clearly in ‘Lit-

authorities say it is an even better
psychological study than ‘The Three
Bears.’”

“Oh, but how can you tolerate
such sordidness?” cried Geoffrey.

“Sordidness indeed!” snorted Cas-
sandra. “You aristocrats make me
ill.”

“Now really, there’s no sense in
confusing these side-issues with the
central biological facts,” Cyril purred,
taking another candy cigarette from
his crumpled pack.

“But don’t you see that the grand
purpose of literature is to present
great truths in noble language?”
protested Geoffrey.

“Let us define our terms,” sug-
gested Cassandra.

“All right,” countered Geoffrey,
“take Jack and Jill, who show the
enduring quality of loyalty despite
adversity, and who...” Geoffrey
stopped, realizing that his example
was about to backfire.

It was too late. Cyril quickly ex-
claimed: “Aha! Voila! And just what
do you think they were doing on top
of that hill? Admiring the daisies?”

“And the mighty shall come tumb-
ling from the heights above,” mur-
mured Cassandra, trying to make the
phrase sound like a quotation.

 

Geoffrey was silent. He nervously
rubbed the table-top, while vanilla
ice cream trickled onto his tremb-
ling hand.

“Well,” said Cyril abruptly. “This
has indeed been a most enlightening
discussion. Especially, I hope, for
Geoffrey. I indeed hope we shall
meet again shortly.”

“Indeed,” said Geoffrey shortly.

THE ENGINEERS HAVE HAIRY EARS

Today in this age of technology when engineering graduates
are wooed and courted by all of America’s great industries, how
do you account for the fact that Rimbaud Sigafoos, who fin-
ished at the very top of his class at M.I.T., turned down hun-
dreds of attractive job offers to accept employment as a machin-
ery wiper at the Acme Ice Company at a salary of $20 a week
with a twelve-hour day, a seven-day week, and only fifteen

minutes for lunch?

I know what you are thinking: “Cherchez la femme!” You are
thinking that Mr. Acme, head of the Acme Ice Company, has
a beautiful daughter with whom Rimbaud is madly in love and
he took the job only to be near her.

Friends, you are wrong. It is true that Mr. Aeme does have
a daughter, a large, torpid lass named Clavdia who spends all
her waking hours scooping marzipan out of a bucket and staring
at a television set which has not worked in some years. Rimbaud
has not the slightest interest in Clavdia; nor, indeed, does any
other man, excepting possibly John Ringling North.

So how come Rimbaud keeps working for the Acme Ice
Company? Can it be that they provide him with free Marlboro
Cigarettes, and all day long he is able to settle back, make
himself comfortable and enjoy the filter cigarette with the un-

filtered taste?

No, friends, no. Rimbaud is not allowed to smoke on the job
and when he finishes his long, miserable day he has to buy his
own Marlboros, even as you and J, in order to settle back and
enjoy that choice tobacco, that smooth, mellow flavor, that in-
comparable filter, that pack or box.

Well, friends, you might as well give up because you’ll never
in a million years guess why Rimbaud works for the Aeme Ice
Company. The reason is simply this: Rimbaud is a seal!

He started as a performing seal in vaudeville. One night on
the way to the Ed Sullivan show, he took the wrong subway.
All night the poor mammal rode the B.M.T., seeking a helping
hand. Finally a kindly brakeman named Ernest Thompson
Sigafoos rescued the hapless Rimbaud.

He took Rimbaud home and raised him as his own, and
Rimbaud, to show his appreciation, studied hard and got ex-
cellent marks and finished a distinguished academic career as

valedictorian of M.L.T.

Rimbaud never complained to his kindly foster father, but
through all those years of grammar school and high school and
college, he darn near died of the heat! A seal, you must re-
member, is by nature a denizen of the Arctic, so you ean im-
agine how poor Rimbaud must have suffered in subtropical
New York and Boston, especially in those tight Ivy League

suits.

But today at the Acme Ice Company, Rimbaud has finally
found a temperature to his liking. He is very happy and sends

greetings to his many friends,
