__— TAPPED FOR Pl BETA KAPPA

 

Doctor Junkin
Paints Tapestry
For Troub Phy |

By HENRY M. STROUSS

The splendor of a medieval court has
been recreated by Dr. Marion Junkin
for the Troubadour production of
Pirandello’s “Henry IV.” The play
which involves a contemporary Italian
nobleman who believes himself to be
the 11th century German Emperor
Henry IV will be presented next
Tuesday through Friday evenings
(March 7-10) at 8:30.

The psychological realism necessary
for an effective rendering of “Hen-
ry IV” has resulted in one of the most
elaborate stage settings ever used in a
Troubadour production. The settings
are designed around reproductions of
famous llth century tapestries that
have been adapted from the originals
by Dr. Junkin, head of the W&L Fine
Arts Department, and painted by Ted
Oldham and Frank D’Lauro using a
special painting technique on burlap.

 

A tapestry from the well known Reproducing 11th Century tapestries for the upcoming Sveiesiens play “Henry IV” are art directors Ted Old-

“Unicorn” group, on display at the
Cloisters in New York City, depicting*

ham and Frank D’Lauro.

 

peasent huntsmen with their dogs,
setting out in pursuit of the unicorn
serves as the backdrop for the entire
scene, The center of action is the im-
perial throne covered by a baldachin
of imported gold and white brocade.
The throne is flanked by two life-size
portraits painted by Dr. Junkin of
Robert Allen, playing the title role,
and Susan Howard, portraying his
fiancee. These portraits contrast with
the tapestries as they are done in con-
temporary style, in keeping with a
development in the play’s plot.

The setting is complimented by bat-
tleflags of German city-states cut and
sewn from brightly colored fabrics.

A second tapestry is used for the
scene changes in the play. It repre-
sents a medieval court scene with the
lords and ladies gathered around a
fountain indulging in a musical after-
noon.

Seats for the production of “Henry
IV” may be reserved by calling the
Troubadour box office (HO 3-2814)
between 2-6 p.m. or 7-8 p.m. Tickets
will also be sold at the door.

 

‘Sit-Ins’ Discussion Set

By UCA For Coming Week

The University Christian Associa-
tion is sponsoring a panel discussion
on the “sit-in” problem next Tues-
day night, March 7. The program is
planned for 7 p.m. at the Student
Union.

Dr. Hodges, faculty advisor for
the UCA seminar series, said, “The
sit-in question is a matter which
we need to face, it seems to me,
no matter what our position on the
matter may be.”

Hodges mentioned that the UCA
plans to present all sides of the ques-
tion through a four or five man panel.
There will be a representative of
the legal, segregationist, and inte-
grationist point of view. The pros-
pective members of the panel have
been contracted, and the completed
list will be released later this week.

Dr. Hodges added that all W&L
students and faculty are invited.

Debate Team
Wins 3 Awards

A Washington and Lee University
debate team composed solely of
freshmen won three of 12 individual
speaking awards given at the Mt.
Mercy Varsity Invitational Debate
Tournament in Pittsburgh Saturday.

Thirteen colleges took part in the
tourney. Only Duquesne University,
with all four of its undefeated
trophy-winning team receiving rec-
ognition, gained more individual
honors than Washington and Lee.

Washington and Lee’s team, the
only all-freshman entry, was com-
posed of William A. Noell, Jr., Blue-
field, W. Va.; Alfred E. Eckes, Jr.,
Bradford, Pa. John W. Clark, Jr.,
Birmingham, Ala; and John H.
Kirkley, Atlanta, Ga.

Coach of the Washington and Lee
debaters is William W. Chaffin, in-
structor in English, under whose di-
rection debating has experienced a
resurgence of interest on the Lex-
ington campus.

 

 

SWMSFC

Rehearsals For ‘Heads or Tails’
Begun By Final Cast Members

By RICHARD CRUSE

The cast for the 1961 SWMSFC
Musical is finally set according to
Steve Danzansky, director. The cast
took two weeks to settle because of
some students’ inability to keep up
with rehearsal schedules.

Danzansky said that this year’s
cast is one of the best he has ever
worked with. Cal de Coligny is
playing the lead role of Marcus, the
play’s hero. In the female lead is
Debra Doherty, a sophomore at
Sweet Briar, playing Lysistrata.

Andy Leonard, Lambda Chi soph-
omore, has the comedy lead of
Gallupolonus. Opposite Leonard will
be Nancy Duncan, a junior at Sweet

Briar, playing a Spartan girl.

The second leads are John Towler
as Tiresias, Chris Christy playing
Myrrhine, and Firth Speigel as Ci-
nesias. Other second leads are Anne
Houghton as Chloe, Tommy Andrews
as Creon, and Valeria Elbrick play-
ing Electra. Phil Booth plays Crito,
an Athenian general.

The members of the Council are
Ned Ames, Windy Weed and Brack
Dew. Two more attendants upon
Callupolonus are Delphius and Phi-
dippides played respectively by Pete
Traeger and Pete Alford.

Other members of the cast include
Ron Alenstein (Nepsus), Bart

 

Chamberlain (Philo), and Dave Mun-

 

LL ee

Carmichael’s Dancing School

Closes To ‘Drunk Last Night’

The name “Ring-tum Phi” sounds
more like a yell than the name of
a college paper. It should. It was.

Back in 1897, one of the Generals’
yells went like this:

Ring-tum Phi
Stickeri-bum
We're hot stuff
From Lexington.
Rah! Rah! Rah!
White and Blue
Whoopla, whoolpa!
W. L.
Not only was that a college yell

back in 1897, but it was the only one
Washington and Lee had.

So, naturally or not, when J. Sam
Slicer and Gordon R. Houston
founded the paper in that year they
chose the name Ring-tum Phi. It was
also picked to signify the “Voice of
the Student Body.”

The two Ring-tum Phi founders |

had little financial troubles in that
day and time. Advertisements were
plentiful. Local merchants found
their ads well-read because the
editors often slipped in such fact
gems as this one:

“Found—in front of Dr. Howe's,
shoe, number 3 1/2. Having a long
tongue it is supposed to be of
feminine gender.—R. E. L.

The “Ring-tum Phi” yell was dis-
earded in 1900 but the paper has
continued under that name to today.

The fourteenth issue of the Ring-

tum Phi was published on Saturday,
Jan. 15, 1898. This was after The
Southern Collegian had been estab-
lished, for the lead article in that edi-
tion described what articles would
appear in the forthcoming Collegian.

A news story on the third page
of this edition is headlined “Miss
Carmichael’s Dancing Class Closes

with a Flourish.” The article goes
on to say:

“Saturday evening, Dec. 11, the
most brilliant event of the season
took place when Miss Carmichael
| Bave her last lesson in the dancing
| hall on Randolph Street. The rooms
were tastefully decorated with cut
| flowers and growing plants. At 8
o'clock Miss Anderson took her
place at the piano, and to the in-
spring strains of ‘Drunk Last
Night,’ the class entered the room
led by Miss Laura Tucker. The young
lides were in fancy dress, repre-
senting flowers.”

Another story—this one buried
on the fourth page with all the
ads—told of a New Year’s party.
“The New Year’s German given by
the Cotillion Club on Friday was
one of the most delightful we have
ever held. The dancing was so in-
spiring that even after the second
“Home Sweet Home,” one person
was so full of irrepressible spirits
as to make a hundred yards dash
across the campus to the delight
of all beholders.”

Such was life at Washington and
Lee just before the turn the cen-
tury, as reported by Edition Number
14 of the Ring-tum Phi.

The Ring-tum Phi today has a
circulation of nearly 1500. It’s sub-
scribers include students, faculty,
alumni, parents of students and
friends of the university.

The newspaper is published semi-
weekly, on Tuesday and Friday.
Each staff is headed by a different
editor.

One business staff serves both edi-
tions. Ads are solicited from Lex-
ington merchants and national com-
panies. Over the years the Ring-tum
Phi has built up a faithful clientele

roe (Antilles). The Spartan general
will be played by Robin Wood, the
Spartan herald by Ed Croft, and
the Athenian herald by Stuart Yoffe.

The Men’s Chorus consists of Bill
Fidler, Bart Chamberlain, John
Winebrenner, Dave Streetman, Herb
Solomon, Bruce Whelihan, Dave
Peters, Phil Booth, Windy Weed,
John Tyler, Ron Alenstein, Dave
Munroe, and Ned Ames.

Women’s Chorus

The Women’s Chorus is composed
of Chris Christy, Ann Houghton,
Valerie Elbrick, Chris Devol, Char-
lotte Turner, Angie Castella, Emily
Maxwell, Cheri Fitzgerald, Windy
Wilkins, and Peggy Johnson.

Commenting on the cast, Dan-
zansky said, “I am very proud and
excited about this year’s cast, even
more so than last year at this time.
We are working with a larger num-
ber of people, but everyone is work-
ing so hard and carrying out his
part, no matter how small, in such a
professional manner that the time ap-
pears to fly by and the rehearsals
are carried out smoothly. Two ex-
amples of dedication afforded the
show this year are that no one has
missed a rehearsal and everyone is
working outside on their parts.”

Danzansky Experienced

Danzansky also cited Andy Leon-
ard who had his appendix removed
a week ago Monday yet showed up
for rehearsal that Friday against the
advice of his doctor, but as Danzan-
sky puts it, “on the advice of his
own dedication and feeling for the
show.”

Danzansky has had plenty of ex-
pierence running a musical. Last
years SWMSFC Musical, “The Can-
non’s Mouth,” was directed by Dan-
zansky. Last summer he attended
Catholic University in Washington,
where he took music composition
and theory courses in preparation
for writing this year’s show. He has
also been active in the Troubadour
Theatre and Radio Washington and
Lee.

His experience in dramatics in-
cludes work in summer stock thea-
ters, and many other student pro-
ductions. He is also Washington and
Lee’s head cheerleader ,a member of
the Concert Guild Board, and a
Dean’s List student.

Danzansky gained national recog-
nition when Richard Coe, columnist
for the Washington Post, mentioned
his work in writing and directing
“The Cannon’s Mouth.”

Proceeds of the show go to the
Student War Memorial Scholarship
Fund. Last year over 1,000 people
attended the three-day run of “The
Cannon’s Mouth.” A $200 donation
was received from an anonymous
supporter after seeing the show.

Saturday Review Article

| By Fishwick Praises Lee

But Knocks Today’s South

An article by Dr. Marshall Fishwick,
professor of American studies at
Washington and Lee, on “Robert E.
Lee: The Guardian Angel Myth,” ap-
pears in the March 4 issue of the Sat-
urday Review.

Dr. Fishwick describes the reverence
in which General Lee’s name has been
held in the South since the War Be-
tween the States. Says Dr. Fishwick,
“Robert E. Lee was the most remark-
able man the American South has pro-
duced. Others were more versatile, in-
telligent, learned, and articulate, but
Lee has been the most influential. Un-
successful as a soldier he was turned
into a saint. Now even those whose
Union he almost detroyed reverence
him. The man who could not save the
Confederacy as a general now hovers
over it like a guardian angel.”

Dr. Fishwick argues that the South
has been guilty of myopia. He finds the
South’s refusal to cope with her own
particular problems contrary to the
spirit General Lee manifested as presi-
dent of Washington College. “Rather
than re-enacting Confederate battles,
the South should enact laws that
would stop patential battles from tak-
ing place in our own time... General
Lee would have seen the need for a
new strategy instantly; guardian angel
Lee never will.”

Dr. Fishwick surveys the rapidly
changing condition in international
affairs and contemporary scholarship
and concludes “I prefer to think that
in our day, as in his, he would think
not in terms of defense but offense. If
our South be as bold as his was and
as willing to risk everything for de-
cent and honorable principles, she
might become a challenge rather than
an enigma to the free world.”

Calyx Elections

Phi Beta Kappa, the oldest Greek-
letter fraternity in the United States,
was founded at William and Mary in
1786. Secrecy was abandoned years
ago, and since 1846 the society has
been strictly an honorary scholastic
fraternity. Membership in Phi Beta
Kappa has long been one of the high-
est academic distinctions.

The purpose of the organization is to
recognize and encourage scholarship
and cultural interests. Qualifications
for membership are high scholarship,
liberal culture, and good character.

 

The Phi Beta Kappa Calyx pic-
ture will be taken Friday, March 3,
at 1 o’clock, in front of Washington
College.

 

Since its founding fifty years ago,
Gamma of Virginia has conferred
membership on students with out-
standing academic records. Originat-
ing with ten people, one of whom was
Dr. Robert W. Dickey, now W&L pro-
fessor of physics, the W&L Phi Beta
Kappa chapter has over 600 living
members. In recent years, juniors who
have exceptionally distinguished rec-
ords, not below the requirement for
summa cum laude (2.75), have been
selected for membership.

Election of academic seniors is based
upon seven semesters of work, includ-
ing the freshman year. “Election of
LL.B. candidates is based primarily
upon law grades but previous academ-
ic records are now considered,” Dr.
Desha said.

It is understood that Gamma of Vir-
ginia considers each graduating class
by itself and each individual elected.
Election is not based on any fixed per-
centage of the class and there is no
strict numerical requirement for mem-
bership.

At last night’s meeting of the Gam-
ma Chapter, besides making the selec-
tion of new members, the chapter re-
elected Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy presi-
dent of the local chapter and Dr.
James G. Leyburn vice-president. Dr.
L. J. Desha also was re-elected to his
post of secretary-treasurer. Present
student members of Phi Beta Kappa
include J. E. Kocen, A. W. McThenia,
Jr., Charles W. Miller, W. W. Moore,
G. P. Pardington, and B. H. Vitsky.
Thirty-four members of the faculty
are members of Phi Beta Kappa.

U.S.-Soviet Relations

 

Must We Cite Similarities?

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

President Kennedy said, in his
inaugural address, that we and the
leaders of the Soviet Union should
concentrate not on those things
which separate us but on _ those
things which bind us (or words to
that effect).

Fatuous remarks such as_ that
should be challenged. A good deal
of emphasis should be placed on
those things which separate the
Soviet Union from the United States.

First is Lubianka Prison. This is
where thousands have been tortured

Second is the concentration camps

which political prisoners are sent
to work under conditions more
ghastly than those in an any Georgia

direction of the central government

purpose of stifling opposition to the

Third is the suppression of Dr.

National, Tribal Interests Conflict
In Touchy African Power Vacuum

By GEORGE BIRDSONG

(Editor’s note: the following ar-
ticle is the result of a week’s con-
certed study of the African situa-
tion. This study was held for four
days in New York and three days
in Washington and was centered
around the theme of “The Emerg-
ing African Nations and Their ef-
effect on the United Nations and
U.S. Foreign Policy.”)

The African continent is a vast
land mass which only a few years
ago was considered of little or no
immediate importance. Today that
same African continent is a critical
area. Secretary General Hammar-
skjold has referred to Africa as
a possible powder keg for the cold
war if the conditions in the Congo
continue to deteriorate.

Realizing that Africa is of major
importance one might seek to under-
stand the forces which are inter-
woven to form the complex African
situation. The basic issues are na-
tionalism, anti-colonialism, tribal-
ism, Pan-Africanism, and the prob-
lem of the “power vacuum” and
how will it be filled.

Anti-Colonialism

The issues of nationalism and anti-
colonialism are very closely related,
as the former is to a great extent
an expression of the anti-colonial
feeling. To the educated African
nationalism, independence, and self-
determination are a natural result
of a human being’s desire for self-

 

respect, dignity and equality. For
this reason Africans are willing to
die for their national integrity.

Futhermore, they do not want
someone else tell them when they
are ready for independence. “Who
are you to tell me when I am ready
for independence,” is a typical Af-
rican reaction. It may be that Bel-
gium paid too much attention to
similar statements and granted the
Congo independence too quickly.

A few years ago only Egypt, Li-
beria, and Ethopia were independent.
The independent Union of South
Africa which is virtually a white
dictatorship with the apartheid
racial discrimination policy. The rest
of Africa was under the direction of
the metropole countries... Britain,
France, Portugal, Belgium.

After the 1960 “African indepen-
dence year,” however, there were
twenty-seven independent _ states,
and the total may extend over fifty
before the drive for independence
is completed.

To the African, anti-colonialism
means the end of colonial rule in
Africa. The face of the colonial
powers has been Western, and the
remaining colonial powers in the
African’s mind are still Western, as
for example France in Algeria,
Britain in North and South Rho-
desia, and Portugal in Mozambique
and Angola. The Union of South
Afriea is also considered a colonial
power by some Africans.

troops to burn and kill the only
men in the West who would fight for
their freedom.

These are the things which sepa-
rate the Soviet Union and the
United States. They are also for-
gotten.

Surely there is evil in agonized
deaths of the maimed men in the
cellars of Lubianka Prison, in the
crushing of mind and body in the
slave camps of Siberia, in the stifling
of the spirit of Pasternak, in the
murder of Hungary. For if there is
no evil here, there is no evil.

This evil separates us, for they
use men like animals, to be worked
and slaughtered as circumstances
order, and we try to let men remain
men. How can we ignore these
things?

And if we have fallen so that we
can ignore evil, how can we ignore
the threat to ourselves from a na-
tion whose every effort since it’s
beginning has been, without excep-
tion, directed at our destruction,
whose latest excrescence of evil was
threatened to to bury us and all we
hold to be good and just?

If we have fallen so that the
threat of death is enough to make
us surrender, then to what puropse
did the Spartans stand at Thermop-
olae, the French at Poitiers and the
Poles at the gates of Vienna.

The Soviet Union is evil, immoral
and wrong. There can be no greater
difference than that. This must be

a Ring-tum Phi dated January 15,
1898, serve to point up the great
amount of tradition and continuity
that are found in W&L’s present
institutions. A closer reading of this
old paper shows that many of these
institutions, despite their use of the
same names, have changed radically
over the passing decades.

Take the Southern Collegian, for
example. In 1898, the newly reno-
vated Collegian was primarily a
means of student literary expres-
sion,

According to the R-t P’s review,
the featured article of that Novem-
ber’s Collegian was the text of an
address given by one Mr. Bullitt on
“The New Woman.”

Mr. Bullitt, says the review, pro-
phesied “that ‘The New Woman’ will
pass from the arena ‘unwept, un-
honored, and unsung’ and that her
place ‘will be filled by the more
feminine sisters, who will move on-
ward and upward until they shall
have reached that pinnacle of per-
fection thus far attained by none
save by the fairest of the daughters
of the South.”

History wasted no time in prov-
ing Mr. Bullitt a rather poor prog-
nosticator. A more accurate predic-
tion was given by the author of
a poem called “The Twentieth Cen-
tury Girl,” who concluded that this
new creature would never, never
change

Also in this issue of the Col-
legian were a sketch of life in the
nearby hills (which would probably
hold true even today), and two boy-
meets-girl stories. A science fiction
story was followed by a poem on
the beauties of Lexington.

Concluding the magazine were a
biography of one of the alumni and
two book reviews.

* oo *

The content of the 1897 Colle-
gian—with the possible exception
of the studies of feminine foibles—
would probably draw little reader-
ship today. Yet these young auth-
ors were writing in the idiom of
their times, about topics of cur-
rent interest.

More important, the old Collegian
was giving outlet to the talents and
interests of at least nine students
who felt that they had something to
say.

We cannot help contrasting the
Collegian as it once was, with the
Collegian as it has become.

For the past several years, the
school’s only student magazine—our
only outlet for fiction, poetry, and
lengthy articles—has served as a
loose compendium of questionable
humor. It has become something that
is scanned erratically on dance week-
ends, and eventually winds up being
smuggled around the dormitories of
neighboring girls’ schools.

The Collegian has, admittedly, had
its good moments in recent years.
Occasionally the cartoons and photo-
graphs have been original and well-
executed. Occasionally there have
been jokes, of not too ancient vint-
age, which have actually contained
some humor.

In the way of real creative writ-
ing, however, there have been very
few worthwhile efforts.

One cause of this failing may be
that the really conscientious writers
do not care to publish in this maga-
zine. For one thing, their articles
are often butchered into unintel-

 

emphasized.

By BILL ROBERTS

Gil Bocetti, who was a great
quarterback here and led the 1950
Washington and Lee football team
to the Gator Bowl, was the principal
speaker at the annual banquet at
the end of spring football practice.
Bocetti said he was in favor of
our present de-subsidized football
program. He noted that many alum-
ni were becoming more interested
in the team since we have risen
from the depths of the 1956-58 sea-
sons. But he chose to discuss the
fact that we still do not have very
great support among our alumni
and to suggest some reasons why
crowds have not approached the
size of those seen at Wilson Field
when he was playing.

Bocetti pointed out that much of
the interest evidenced by alumni in
their football team is engendered

Chieftain Vs.
The Sociologists

By PAUL T. WILLIS

The council hall could hardly con-
tain the crowd that morning as the
chief motioned for silence and start-
ed to speak: “As you may be
aware,” he said, “the next few weeks
may be the most important in the
history of our tribe. Several days
from now we shall be visited for the
first time by a group of American
sociologists.”

He paused to let the full import
of this sink in, and to allow the
whispering to die down. After a
moment, the chief continued. “In the
past, perhaps due to some failure of
communications, our tribe has been
sadly neglected. The reason for this
is difficult to understand in the light
of all the doctoral theses being writ-
ten these days. I’ve often looked
with envy, and perhaps a little bit-
terness, on the notoriety given our
neighbors, the Mundagumors and the
Arapesh. Some of you have come to
me and asked ‘what do they have
that we don’t?’, Well my answer to
this is ‘nothing!’ And that, as I see it,
is the whole difficulty.”

There was a quiet, expectant stir in
the room as this sank in. “These so-
ciologists,” he went on, “are more
demanding than in the past. At one
time they could merely describe the
sex customs and the religion, put a
nude woman on the cover, make up
some suggestive title, and the book
would sell.

 

“But not anymore. The college
students are getting more sophis-
ticated these days. In order to
make the sociology books now,
you’ve got to come up with some-
thing diffrent. The same old leg-
ends and rituals just don’t sell any-
more.

“This visit, for which we have
worked so hard, for which we have
spent almost a year’s preparation
in spreading tantalizing rumors, pre-
sents us quite a challenge. Will our
response be adequate?

“We stand, you might say, on the
brink of fame. During the next few
crucial weeks, it will be decided
whether this tribe, dear to our hearts,
shall rise to its rightful place in the
world or once again sink into ob-
livion,

“Later on this evening, I shall ap~
point the final committees. Natural-
ly, we must cover the standard
things, but we must approach them
in a dynamic way. It may be a strain
and an embarrassment to us, but I
feel assured we can endure it for a
while, anyway. Many of us will have
to assume new roles; just remember
that any change in status is not per-
manent, but merely for the duration.

“Starting this evening, I don’t
want to see any of you wearing
those American clothes, and es-
pecially shoes. Walking barefoot
is inconvient, I know, but it is
expected. You’re going to have to
hide the clothes and _ especially
those transistor radios. I’ve arrang-
to mark off an area which we'll
call taboo, where we'll keep every -
thing until the visit is over.

“Another thing, polygamy may
seem an unfair burden for some of
us older men, but it is a sacrifice
we must make for the good of the
tribe.

“Perhaps our most severe test will
come in the field of religion. I don’t
want to see those Bibles lying around.
A special committee has been work-
ing for some time on legends, and
I’m glad to say that we’ve come up
with some good stuff. Those idols
we have out back have been design-
ed to correspond almost exactly with
those found on Easter Island. Natur-
ally, we won't allow them to be in-
spected closely enough to see the
plaster, because they are sacred. If
you get into a really tough spot,

 

 

 

 

 

 

Old Grads Must Face Facts:
Rivalries Of Old Impossible

by the rivalry they have with alumni
of other colleges with whom they
work or associate socially. Wash-
ington and Lee alumni are more
likely to come into contact with
alumni of the University of Virginia,
Virginia Military Institute, and other
Southern Conference and Atlantic
Coast Conference schools than with
alumni of schools on our present
schedule. One major reason is that
the other schools have more alumni,
particularly in Virginia, than Frank-
lin and Marshall, or Sewanee, or
Hampden-Sydney.

Forment New Rivalries

One of the main things to be done
to revive alumni interest in football
at Washington and Lee, according to
Bocetti, is to try to foment these
alumni rivalries with the schools
whom we can meet on the football
field. Bocetti said that he is trying
to do that now and that as the men
in the school now become alumni
that they should try to cultivate
these friendly rivalries.

Bocetti’s fevor on this point is
questionable. He did not seem sure
at all that we would ever win back
the old alumni on this basis. Our
best hope for the future must ap-
parently lie with the men now in
school. They must be the ones to
come back to the school and cheer
on future General teams.

The talk brought to our mind
rather forcefully the fact that Wash-
ington and Lee athletics are still
in a rather sad state. Our unde-
feated football team and the basket-
ball team’s deserving victory over
the Wahoos have been bright spots
this year.

Alumni Appeal

College athletics in America seem
to be committed to a program which
demands that athletic rivalries be
with schools whose alumni will
cherish the competition. These riv-
alries range over more fields than
athletics. Alumni are proud of their
alma mater in many ways—for its
success in intercollegiate athletics,
for its academic standards, and,
although it’s not considered demo-
cratic to say so, for its social stand-
ing.

The Washington and Lee policy
has been, in the words of athletic
director Cy Twombly, “to schedule
the best schools with whom we can
compete.” This is all any student or
alumnus can ask. But we are hand-
icapped in that there are few echools
with our “prestige” in our geogra-
phical area who play on the same
level we do. Washington and Lee
cannot play its classic “Big Six”
schedule in Virginia. Nor can it
schedule out-of-state teams that will
please everyone.

Washington and Lee students and
alumni must live with the fact that
our schedules are never likely to
have the extra-athletic interest that
they had before. It is silly to ex-
pect Washington and Lee men to
foment rivalries with Emory and
Henry men, or Randolph-Macon
men. Many students will feel very
strongly about games with schools
from their home states, as Virgin-
ians do about the Hampden-Sydney
game, or Kentuckians about the
Centre game.

Scheduling Difficult

Mr. Twombly has tried valiantly to
get games with schools like Amherst,
Williams, or Swarthmore. We were
to have had a game with Davidson
this coming football season, on Nov.
18. The game was approved by the
athletic committee here, and the
contract was signed and sent to
Davidson. But at the last minute
Davidson decided to call off the
game.

So we have had difficulty in
scheduling some of the schools
which are often mentioned as part
of a dream conference, of small,
Southern colleges. Sewanee, Centre,
Johns Hopkins (whom we also have
trouble scheduling), Southwestern
in Memphis, and Hampden-Sydney
are among the other schools men-
tioned. We maintain a healthy riv-

To Terminate Season

By DAVE MONTGOMERY

Washington and Lee’s matmen
brought an end to a highly success-
ful season here last night by shut-
ting out the University of Virginia
28-0 and consequently pushing their
overall record to 7-3. It was a dif-
ferent story, however, in the JV
prelim as the Baby Generals col-
lected their only points on a forfeit
in the heavyweight class and bowed
to the Cavaliers, 27-5.

After picking up an easy five
points on a forfeit in the 123 Ib.
class, the Generals went on to
whitewash the Wahoos via decis-
ions by Dave Montgomery (9-2),
Ken Greer (9-3), Sandy Mersereau
(7-4), Dick Albert (5-2), Jud
Babcock (3-1), and Bob Pagano

(9-1) and a pin in 4.40 by freshman
Ed Jansen.

Coach Miller felt that “the boys
really showed their potential last
night,” and believed “that if the team
returns intact next season we should
have an even better record than
a 7-3 mark.”

Captain Sandy Mersereau fa-
cetiously remarked after the
match: “Next year they should be
better. This year, well, good luck
at Hollins or ’Macon.”

As far as the NCAA wrestling tour-
nament in March is concerned, Miller
doesn’t plan to send any entrants
since, “there is really no hope of
holding our own against such teams
as Lehigh, Pitt, Oklahoma, or Mich-

 

igan State.”

 

Swimmers Top Norfolk W&M

Washington and Lee’s swimming
team yesterday closed out its sea-
son with a 54-32 win over the
Norfolk Division of the College of
William and Mary, in the Doremus
Gym pool. The Generals broke
three records in the process, and lost
a fourth on a disqualification.

Elliott Maynard set a new W&L
record in the 200-yard butterfly,
turning in a time of 2:18.5, break-
ing his own record of 1959, 2:21.5.
Co-captain Jim Parker set a pool
record for the 50-yard freestyle,
winning in 49.2 seconds. The old
record, 53 seconds, was set in 1959.
Parker finished the season undefeat-
ed in the 50-yard race. Herb Jahn-
cke set a new W&L record in the
440 freestyle, turning in a time of
5 minutes 18 seconds. The old record,
5:20.4, was also set in ’59.

Norfolk won only two events, the
200-yard individual medley and the

place in the medley relay and the
400-yard freestyle relay when the
W&L teams in those events were
disqualified.

After drying off from a forced
dip in the pool administered by his
happy fish, Coach Norris Eastman
said that he was pleased with the
times his boys turned in, and that
they were close to what he expected.
In his first year as head coach,
Eastman coached the team to a 6-4
record, which included victories over
Roanoke, UVa., Catholic, George-
town, Wake Forest, and Norfolk.

Blue-White Teams Tie, 8-8
In Muddy Battle Saturday

The annual intersquad contest
which ended Spring football prac-
tice was held last Saturday amid
rain, sunshine, and snow. The final
outcome of the game between the
Blues and the Whites was an 8-8 tie.

The first score in the game came
on a 60-yard run of the White’s
fullback Tommy Keessee in the 3rd
quarter. However, the Blues followed
quickly in the 4th quarter with a
keeper play by quarterback Steve
Suttle, which tied the score for the
rest of the game.

The only serious injury of the
game came when Terry Fohs, Lit-
tle All-American center, tackled
Keesee on one of his runs. Terry,
who is known for his hard-hitting
knocked himself out on the tackle
and as a result was out for the
rest of the game.

While the elements made it prac-
tically impossible to play any sort
of decent football, the game still
showed where the team stands as of
now. Coach McLaughlin, in discuss-

generally optimistic. In general, last

 

year’s strength, which was princi-
pally the team’s depth, will still hold.
Coach Mac said that “as of right
right now we could fill up the first
two teams with men who have had
varsity experience. This year’s
freshmen show a lot of promise and
we expect to use them a lot next
year.”

Coach McLaughlin said that the
boys they expected to show up well
during Spring practice did not dis-
appoint him, and there were some
unexpected performances. Singled
out among these was the ground
yardage which Ashley, Wiltshire
gathered for the White’s.

As far as the outlook for next
fall, McLaughlin was cautious in
his optimism. He said that “of
course it is hard to top an unde-
feated season, but remember one
of those was a tie and in three of
them we came from behind. All we
can do is wait for next fall.”

Spring practice formally came to
an end with the annual banquet held
in the Commons. Presented at this
banquet were two awards for the
most improved player of the season
and for the most outstanding player
during Homecoming’s game. Chosen
as the most improved player and
presented with the award given by
the Slater System was Chip Day.
Doug Martin received the Ty Rober
award for the most outstanding
player in the Homecoming’s game.

McHenry Reviews Season With Mixed Emotions

The season is over and the “fight-
ing Generals” have posted a 7-11
record—not exceptional by any
means, yet better than most people
expected. It was also the year we
beat the Wahoos!

In my mind, we definitely were
the “fighting Generals,” for more
than once the ball bounced the other
way; instead of letting up the boys
banded together and worked harder.

With only three lettermen re-
turning the outlook was bleak—then
Mike Monier was unable to play
because of a broken leg, Ken Ko-
walski was never at top form be-
cause of various and sundry in-
juries and missed a few games. John

Our best games, in retrospect,
were the Sewanee, Chattanooga, and
Randolph-Macon games. Our finest
hour in many a season was the

triumph over Virginia—in that game,
everything we did was right. It cer-
tainly was a great triumph by a
great bunch of boys. The crowd, too,

Birdsong Views African Problem

(Continued from page 2)

In many cases the Africans also
mean to end the predominant role
of the expatriate power in their
trade, finance, civil service, military,
and educational institutions.

Anti-colonialism furthermore has
a psychological role. Many Africans
feel they must be “against” some-
thing as one of the requirements for
building unity within the new na-

ligibility. Moreover, they may fear
that their prize creations will be
degraded by association with liter-
ature that is juvenile or crass.

This dearth of good writing is also
caused by a lack of encouragement
toward promising writers. Apparent-
ly there has been little effort to re-
cruit students who really know how
to write, and who have something to
write about.

The absence of a suitable medium
of expression caused a few students,
led by Grayfred Gray, to organize
their own publication. They hope
to climax their efforts with a literary
magazine this spring.

Such private attempts at expres-
sion should be encouraged, and I
wish them all success. Ideally, how-
ever, students would be able to use
an established and widely circulated
magazine — namely, the Southern
Collegian—for their serious attempts
at poetry, fiction, and humor.

tional state. This feeling may very
likely increase in the future as the
African politicans feel they need
to be “against” something in order
to unite the country.

Tribal Problems

Tribalism enters into the picture
at this point because it is a chal-
lenge to national unity. There are
about 800 tribes throughout Africa
and the African tends to remain
loyal to his tribe and to his tribal
chief rather than give his allegiance
to a new, often incomprehensible
idea of a national state. To further
complicate matters may tribes ex-
tend over national boundaries.

Tribalism is challenged by the
call for unity of Pan-Africanism.
This is a movement to unify Africa
which the Pan-African leaders con-
tend has been “Balkanized” by the
colonial powers, especially on the
East Coast. Africa is probably stuck
for awhile with its present national
setup, but the uniting of territories
is bound to come.

Unity both within the national)
state and of territorial states is made
difficult by the power vacuum pres-
ent in most of Africa. There is a
strong tendency for any leader who
achieves some position of power to
either ban or limit the power of his
opposition.

Futhermore, the rights of citizens
are usually not held above the de-
sire for power and hence there is
little accountability of the govern-
ment to the people. This power
vacuum will be filled by African
actors in the future and the U.S. and
past colonial powers must accept
this fact.

The U. S. Dilemma

The U.S. finds itself in a very
difficult position because the face
of Africa’s enemy (colonialsim) is
Western. All of these colonial pow-
ers are American allies and in fact
are important in the structure of
NATO, our basic defense system.
Hence we must support our Euro-
pean allies.

At the same time, however, we
are trying to exert an influence in
Africa, but the Africans tell us we
must choose to support colonial or
anti-colonial policies. Wanting to
please both Europe and Africa, we
are caught in the middle. This is
the essence of our problem.

We must line up with the as-
pirations of the African nations
or either be shut out of Africa.
Thus we must bridge the gap be-
tween pleasing our European allies
who have been the colonial pow-
ers and the African states who are
violently anti-colonial,

It is encouraging to note that Pres-
ident Kennedy and Secretary of
State Rusk consider this change
urgently necessary. For they are
convinced that in the global strug-
gle with communism the “new
frontiers” of conflict will be in Af-
rica, Asia, and Latin America. They
are trying to line up the U.S. with
the revolutionary tide sweeping
these countries, but they are finding
it to be a difficult and dangerous
task.

 

Good Sports Schedule Difficult

alry with Franklin and Marshall.
Carnegie Tech will not play us in
football any longer, evidently be-
cause of insulting behavior toward
a paper-mache Scottie dog of theirs
at the game here in 1959. These
defections from our football sched-
ule may be taken up in 1963 and
1964 by Oberlin and Susquehanna.
We have added Emory and Henry
to the 1961 football schedule.

The problem is simply that Wash-
ington and Lee has had the courage
to stick to their amateur guns while
retaining enough pride to want to
win against the best. Last year in
football we showed what can be
expected from a proud and deter-

Our basketball team showed the
University of Virginia how deter-
mined we are. Now that we are no
longer pushovers it may be even
harder to schedule the opponents
everyone has been crying for.

Perhaps the generation of W&L
men in school now will go out into
the world with a pride in W&L ath-
letics for their intrinsic worth. We
cannot base our pride in our uni-
versity on the sports-page accom-
plishments of paid gladiators. We do
not have to match exploits with
George Washington or Virginia Tech
alumni. Nor should we try.

 

Coming of the Sociologist

something is taboo, but that is a last
resort. The best advice I can give
is to say as little as possible and
act mysterious. Do what your lead-
ers tell you. We have one great ad-
vantage in that a sociologist will be-
lieve anything which works nicely
into a theory, so be consistent.

“In closing, I’d like to emphasize
this crucial time to us all. We can
achieve our deserved place in his-
tory if we are firm in our purpose.
It is entirely in our hands. I would
say to you finally, do not ask what
the tribe can do for you, but what
you can do for the tribe.”

effort by these boys and additional '

Tareyton delivers the flavor...

    
   
   

Here’s one filter cigarette that’s really different!

The difference is this: Tareyton’s Dual Filter gives you a
unique inner filter of ACTIVATED CHARCOAL, definitely proved to
make the taste of a cigarette mild and smooth. It works together with

a pure white outer filter—to balance the flavor elements in the smoke.
Tareyton delivers—and you enjoy—the best taste of the best tobaccos.
