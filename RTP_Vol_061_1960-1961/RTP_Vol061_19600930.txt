Lexington Police Ordered
To Cover W&L Games

The Attorney General of Virginia,
A. S. Harrison, Jr., held Thursday
that the Town of Lexington must be
responsible for the maintenance of
order at W&L athletic events unless
the school gets the Circuit Court to
appoint a special police.

Harrison made the decision in re-
ply to the question of C. S. Glasgow,
Lexington town attorney.

Under Virginia law, Harrison said,
town police have the duty of pre-
serving good law and order within
the city limits.

ndependents To Back
Frosh EC

Bill Noell, from Bluefield, W. Va.,

- was named by the Independent Party
_ Thursday night to carry its stand-

ard in the upcoming election for
freshman Executive Committeeman.

The election has been tentatively
set for Oct. 17. It will fill the 12th
seat on the EC, the body which acts
as a general overseer of student
activities, and also as a judicial body
for honor violations. The other 11
members were elected in the spring.

Noell, who did not pledge a fra-
ternity during regular rush week,
expects to go through deferred rush.

Party chairman Bill Johnston
noted, “Bill was given strong sup-
port in last Wednesday’s meeting of
freshmen not in fraternities.”

Noell’s nomination came Thursday
night after a caucus of the eight In-
dependent houses, together with non-
fraternity representatives, at the
Kappa Sig house. Originally there
were eight candidates for the nom-

* ination.

Noell was one of the two interna-
tional vice presidents of Key Club
International during his senior year
at Bluefield High School. He also
gave the keynote address at this sum-
mer’s international convention.

He was president of the student
body and valedictorian of his class.

Besides being president of the
junior class, he headed the local
chapters of the National Thespians
and the National Forensic Society.
He was a member of the National
Honor Society.

Noell won first place in the state
Voice of Democracy speaking com-
petition, and also gave the keynote
address at Boys State.

He was president of the youth
group in Bluestone Presbytery.

He also played golf and tennis
while in high school. At W&L he
plans to go out for the debate team
and spring sports.

The Independent Party is com-
posed of the following houses: Delt,
Kappa Sig, Lambda Chi, PEP, Phi
Gam, Phi Psi, Pi Kap, and Sig Ep.

The freshman class representative
to the student Executive Commit-
tee will be elected Monday, Oct. 17,
in Lee Chapel.

Two candidates, one from the Uni-
versity Party and one from the In-
dependent Party will be formally
nominated during the first portion
of the Oct. 17 meeting. After the
nomination, freshmen will choose
their representative by secret ballot.

The floor will be open for nomi-
nations other than the candidates
who will be advanced by the two
student parties, but the contest will
lie between the two men with formal
backing, officials say.

The two parties are expected to
reveal the names of their proposed
candidates early in October, perhaps
next week, so that the campaigning
may begin.

In last year’s contest, Tom Rains,
a KA from Atlanta, Ga., was elected
to the freshman post in a run-off
election with Meade Christian, a
Phi Gam from Richmond, Va.

Smathers Comin

 

Steve Danzansky, head cheerlead-
er, announces that numerous changes
have been made in the W&L cheer-
leaders and Pep Band this year.

Danzansky, a ZBT senior from
Washington, D.C. will join with eight
other students to undertake the
cheerleading responsibilities. Juniors
Jay Green and Dick Starmn, Sopho-
more Randy Cole, and Freshmen
Barry Green, Dave Harrison, Jack
Mitchell, Mal Freeman, and Scot
Peace will complete the squad.

This fall, the cheerleaders are
planning to circulate among the
students mimeographed sheets with
all of the football cheers. This should
help the freshmen as well as the
upperclassmen to become better ac-
quainted with the cheers. Danzan-
sky feels that this should promote
more spirit at the games.

Mike Herndon, a Pi Phi, has been
named by Danzansky as the new
student leader of the Pep Band.
Herndon estimates that there will be
as many as twenty-five instruments
in the Pep Band this year.

In summing up his aspirations for
the coming year, Danzansky said,
“the enthusiasm shown by the stu-
dents at last year’s Mock Conven-

The Young Republicans Club of
Washington and Lee held its first
meeting Wednesday evening in the
student union. The keynote speaker
for the evening was John Dalton,
son of Federal District Court Judge
Ted Dalton, and a prominent Radford
lawyer himself.

ing was John Downey, state vice

me.

Senator George A. Smathers of
Florida, one of the most outstanding
legislators in Congress, will be in
Lexington on Thursday, Oct. 20 to
promote the candidacy of Sen. John
IF. Kennedy for the presidency.

Smathers heads up the campaign
in the South for the Massachusetts
senator and his running mate, Lyn-
don B. Johnson. Smathers plans to
address Lexington Democrats and
Kennedy supporters at a luncheon
here.

“If there is considerable student
support and potential attendance,”
according to Mr. C. H. Davidson,
local attorney and Democratic chair-
man for this area, “We would like
to have the luncheon in Evans
Dining Hall (the Commons). This
will, however, depend upon the stu-
dent Democratic organization in the
university.”

Smathers will arrive in Lexington
after an address at Charlottesville
and will journey to Roanoke after his
appearance here.

The Washington and Lee Univer-
sity branch of the “Students for
Kennedy and Johnson” club will hold
its organizational rally on Tuesday,
October 4, at 7:30 p.m. in the Stu-
dent Union Building.

George A. Smathers, United States
Senator from Florida

The student coordinator for the
group, Jerry Hyatt, a Delt junior,
says that the primary purpose of
the group will be to promote the
candidacy of Senator John F. Ken-
nedy for President of the United
States. The organization also hopes to
provide an outlet for the expression
of student political beliefs and en-
courage student interest and partici-
pation in national affairs on a non-
partisan basis.

All students are cordially invited
to attend this organizational rally.

 

With the first few notes of the
“Patterns” theme song, last Wednes-
day night at 8:05, Radio Washington
and Lee began its first full academic
year of broadcasting.

Beginning with Monday night’s
“Pro Musica,” Radio W&L will be
heard every Monday through Thurs-
day night, from 8:05 until 9:00 p.m.,
over radio station WREL.

“Pro Musica,” featuring classical
music, is produced by Pete Lynn, Pi
Kappa Phi junior from Lynchburg,
Va. Dick Kelley is his assistant pro-
ducer, with the balance of the staff
made up of Bruce Chosney and Pete
Blakeslee.

Tuesday night’s show is “Concert,”
which plays music of a semi-classical
variety, and is produced by Steve
Guild, Kappa Sigma junior from
Oaklahoma City, Okla. Robert Mott-
ley is the assistant producer, aided
by staff members Jim Whelihan,

vote for Nixon.

The group will also cooperate with
the Lexington Republican organiza-
tion headed by Hank Oder, a local
lawyer and unsucessful candidate for
the congressional seat from this dis-
trict in 1958. The work with the
town group will consist of canvass-
ing the town to get people out to
the polls.

Dalton, in his speech, mentioned
that W&L students have long been
ranking figures in the Young Repub-
licen organization. A student here
held the position of vice chairman-

Homecomings

Plans Are Set

The annual Washington and Lee
Homecoming Weekend will begin
this year with a meeting of the
alumni board of trustees on Friday,
Oct. 7 at 2 p.m. Friday evening,
a student pep rally held under the
auspices of the Varsity Club will be
held in Doremus Gymnasium. The
annual freshman parade will begin in
the gym and will continue through
the streets of the town. Homecoming
Queen candidates from the frater-
nities will lead the parade.

The fraternity decoration contest
will again be held with viewing of
the displays by the judges on Fri-
day night and again on Saturday.

A Question

Although we are resolved that the Washington and Lee

“Fighting Five Star Generals”

can only meet unprecidented

success, we feel somewhat dismayed about an unreasonable
demand made upon the dates, acquaintances and family of
members of the student body by the athletic complex.

Granting that inflation is here to stay, we of Washington
and Lee—pillar of un-subsidized athletics—still condemn the
$2.00 admission price to our football games. This is a 100
per cent increase over the last two years.

Our form of athletics has drawn much criticism, yet it has
stood fast, a bulwark of that mode of competition which best
meets the requirements of an academic community. It appears,
however, that this status quo is equally unbearable. Once again
our eyes are on the bowls, rather than Wilson Field, and “big
business” and its emanations are creeping onto the gridiron
amid the almost forgotten—now reappearing shouts of a

pleased crowd.

Is this to be the price of a successful football season at
W&L? If so, shell out ‘‘minks’’ and be content! The team will
appear in new uniforms; the traveling accommodations will be
much more suitable; and once again will be paying “‘contem-
porary” fees to see “contemporary” football. Yet, let us not
forget those who will walk away dismayed or indigent from
the three grey ticket offices back up the foot bridge leaving

behind our colossus.

 

A Reminder

Perhaps it is worth remembering that The Administration
Committee of the Faculty in conjunction with the Board of
Trustees has declared alien to university relations any societies,
clubs or fraternities which engage in the practice of physical or

mental abuse.

In the immediate past this enforcement has been rigid.
We propose that in the immediate future any breach of this
regulation will be met with severe action.

 

 

Bushwacking With Luthy

No Football Game, And Combo
Are Saturday Night Problems

By TOM LUTHY

With the football team on the road |

and Big Joe Hatchett’s Bad Axe
combo playing at the Hungry Hill

dares to bring a date into our thriv-
ing metropolis will probably find
himself at a momentary loss for
ideas as to good, clean fun on a
Saturday night.

Then comes the startling revela-
tion—why not take in a Hollywood
thriller. The friendly townsfolk will
inevitably get your money anyway,
so it’s up the street or around the
corner to the flick.

No need to consult last week’s
copy of The Rockbridge County
News for the listings. A two minute
walk through town will disclose the
present headliners. Since the abund-
ance of theaters in Lexington offers
a wide range of choice, I heartily
recommend either the State (Stanley
Warner’s attempt to monopolize Lex-
ington) or the Lyric (more com-
monly known to all as the arm
pit).

Prices are still comparatively
low. Apparently the Virginia legis-
lature forgot to pass a tax for
movies this summer.

 

Hollywood producers have been
claiming that their new lines of pic-
tures will provide a higher degree
of adult entertainment, that is, if the

mixer this weekend, anyone who! State board of censors hasn’t pre-

viously cut out some of the more
interesting sequences.

The facts should be clear, however.
With such fine films as Murder, Inc.,
All the Fine Young Cannibals, and
Breakout being featured, how can
one resist? In my madness I would
also suggest that you attend a mati-
nee so that while in the lobby “get-
ting a treat,” the exit stands readily
accessible, if you are not 99 and
44/100 per cent satisfied. With a
burst of that seven-minute mile
speed, you can still make it to the
ABC store before it closes.

Following another monetary out-
lay, you'll probably find a crimson
traffic summons on your car, now
so vividly marked for the town
constables by those little blue tags.

Your day is then complete, having
been buffeted on all sides from vary-
ing factors of our snug little village,

As you travel in the car, you be-
gin to wonder if your brainstorm
about going to the movies was so
good after all!

 

Students Seem To Distrust
W&L’s Disciplinary Groups

By JIM VANN
Friday Columnist

From listening to much of the
talk that flows around the student
. body, one can
hardly help sens-
ing that the ma-
jority of the
Washington and
Lee students,
-_ whether’ through
ignorance or mis-
information, re-
gard the various
) disciplinary com-
- mittees here as
* little more than

arbitrary gestapo-

Vann
es. The average attitude toward the
various committees—from the Exec-
utive Committee on down—would
seem to be one of fear and, indeed
distrust.

Recently, it has been my exper-
ience to talk with several groups
among the Freshman class in an at-
tempt to illucidate the various as-
pects of the Honor System and ex-
plain the functions of the E.C. Al-
most without fail, the questions that
were asked me were of such a na-
ture as to indicate that the person
asking regarded the E.C. as an all-
knowing, all-reaching goon squad
that was out to badger and bully the
Student Body into submission. Un-
fortunately, this attitude isn’t con-
fined only to the freshmen, and all-
to-many upperclassmen tend to re-
gard these committees, especially

 

Fulbright Exchange Students
Hold Varied Opinions on W&L

By W&L News Service

Washington and Lee University’s
three foreign exchange students
agree on three major points, but
they view nearly everything else
about their new lives quite different-
ly.

They agree that the United States
is like descriptions in books they
have read, that faculty-student re-
lations at Washington and Lee are
better than in their native countries
and that students should not be

forced to attend classes.

The three students, Anthony An-
toniades of Thessalonika, Greece;
Peter Turk of Bad Godesberg, Ger-
many; and Rienhard Hroch of Salz-
burg, Austria, are studying at Wash-
ington and Lee this year under the
auspices of the Fulbright Commis-
sion.

Their friendly disagreement over
so many of their new experiences
seems to stem from differences in
their educations and customs and
traditions in their home countries.

Traveled 15,000 Miles
The three students traveled a
combined total of more than 15,000
miles for their year’s study at Wash-
ington and Lee. Each of them came
by ship and docked in New York
City nearly a month ago.

Turk, 23, learned to speak Eng-
lish four years ago and is fluent in
three other languages. Antoniades,
20, gained his speaking and writing
knowledge of English some seven
years ago. Hroch has known our
language for five years. He is also

 

able to converse or write in French,

Dislike Absences Limit

All three of the Fulbright win-
ners made particular reference to
Washington and Lee’s system of
limited absences. Each of them felt
that forced study tended to make the
student resent classroom activity.
They noted that they are used to
unlimited absences from their lec-
ture sessions which often include as
many as 500 students for one lec-
ture. They felt that the European
system allows for more individual
intellectual achievement than does
the system used by many American
colleges and universities.

The size of the classes in Greece,
Germany and Austria caused the
foreign exchange students to com-
ment on faculty-student relations
here.

Antoniades

Anthony Antoniades, who prefers
to be called “Tony,” is the only one
of the three who will remain in the
United States for a complete col-
lege education. He is enrolled in
Washington and Lee’s sophomore

 

class. He expects to stay here for
at least one more year after this
one before transferring to a school
of engineering for completion of his
work in mechanical engineering.
This year, Antoniades is taking
courses in mathematics, engineering,
physics, economics and English.

Turk

Turk is taking a year’s leave of
absence from his medical studies in
Germany. His year at Washington
and Lee is being devoted to “an
education that will give me a more
general knowledge outside of the
field of medicine.” He is taking
courses in English literature, philoso-
phy, history and sociology.

When he returns to Germany he
will have two more years of medical
study.

Hroch

Hroch, who is interested in the
study of law, has the same idea
as Turk for his stay at Washington
and Lee. He will resume his law
studies upon his return to Salzburg.

 

the E.C., with this quizzical suspi-
cion. Questions such as, “How can
you expect me to report my best
friend for a violation” are heard
much too often.

The fundamental trouble here is
that too many persons have failed
to approach the question in its true
light and are concerned with a prob-
lem that really needn’t be a prob-
lem at all. When we enter Wash-
ington and Lee and take for our-
selves the prestige that is associated
with her name and enjoy the bene-
fits that she has to offer, then we
also incur obligations and the great-
est obligation is that we will do our
part in upholding what Washington
and Lee stands for—or in other
words, we will support her tradi-
tions. And what finer tradition could
there possibly be than that of honor!
So, it is not merely a question of

McDowell Asks
Why Isn’t W&L
Now U.Va.?

(Editor’s note: The following let-
ter appeared in a recent issue of
the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Mr.
McDowell, a graduate of Washing-
ton and Lee, is a regular column-
ist for that publication.)

Mr. W. C. Washburn,

Alumni Secretary

Washington and Lee University
Lexington, Va.

Dear Bill,

You and I are well aware, of
course, of our Alma Mater’s long
and wholesome rivalry with the
University of Virginia, that state in-
stitution across the mountain from
Lexington. I am not talking about
the football rivalry because that has
lapsed and the subject is too pain-
ful to go into here, although it is
hard to forget what fun it was to
razz the Wahoos’ superior manner
and to shout “Beat State!” at them.

Anyhow, what I am talking about
is the rivalry of tradition and pride.
Ours is a considerably older college
than the Wahoo institution, and was
going strong with George Washing-
ton’s endorsement years before
Thomas Jefferson ever thought up
the University of Virginia.

That brings me to the point of this
letter. I have been reading the bound
copies of an old magazine called
Niles’ Register published in 1819.
The magazine contains what pur-
ports to be a transcription of Thomas
Jefferson’s report to the General
Assembly in which he made detailed
recommendations for the establish-
ment of the University of Virginia.
It is a disillusioning thing.

Jefferson was chairman of a board

 

charged with locating the university,

By GEORGE HONTS

They say that everyone has prob-
lems. But Carl Collett, better
known as Doc, has a very special
one.

He has had built, under the Cor-
ner Grill (corner Nelson St. and
and Lee Ave.), a beer garden large
enough to accommodate 60 to 80
customers. But when he applied for
a beer license for it recently, the
Alcohol Beverage Control Board of
Virginia denied him a license. This
week a hearing was held in the Rock-
bridge County Courthouse, the re-
sults of which he and Mrs. Doe, as
his wife is known to W&L students,
are anxiously awaiting.

Doc is sure he has hit upon just
the thing that Washington and Lee
end VMI students need...A good
place to take a date on a week-end
where they can be sure of decent
treatment and good service. This
seems to be his prime motive for
building the addition to the Corner
Grill.

Three Years in Making

Doc says he had had the idea for
for the beer garden in his mind for
at least three years. He looked at
the basement of the Trade Winds
Club in Roanoke, the ‘snack bar’ in
Hotel Roanoke and the Raven Room
in Howard Johnson’s restaurant in
Charlottesville. All three of these
places, including the one in Wahoo
land, are underground and have
only two windows, or none at all
like Doc’s.

Problems Delay ABC

Apparently the ventilation prob-
lem plus the fact that the room ecan-
not be seen from the street is hold-
ing the ABC Board back. But Doc
has installed an exhaust fan in the
front end of the room which is com-
pletely capable of removing all “bad
air” from the room. Even if it didn’t,
where would the “atmosphere”
come from? And there are large win-
dows in the room in the rear of the
basement.

Getting back to atmosphere, Doc’s
will be abounding with it. The walls
are made of Williamsburg brick
which are hand-made and at least
one hundred years old.

The bricks came from Staunton.
This summer, Charles W. Barger &
Son, a Lexington contracting firm,
purchased an old residence on the
grounds of the insane asylum in
Staunton. Barger tore the building
down and used the bricks in the
walls of the beer garden. Real at-
mosphere.

This is to be, Doc says (and he
sounds like he really means _ it)
strictly for the students of Lexing-
ton’s two industries, W&L and VMI.
He plans to hire, as he puts it, a
strong boy and a waitress to work
the beer garden, if it is to become
one.

Room for Professors

tion made so the professors could
enjoy a degree of privacy when they
do come down from the hill. Larger
parties of students use it on the
weekends when they want to eat
together.

The sailfish which is hanging on
the rear wall of this room has been
a source of “jokes.” Students have
said that it was caught in the Maury
during the summer. Not only is this
unlikely, it is untrue. Captain Dick
Smith, a former W&L director of
athletics who is well-known among
students and owner of the Corner
Grill building, caught it in Ft. Laud-
erdale, Fla., while fishing with a
former W&L baseball ace there.

Came 15 Years Ago

Doc came to the Corner in an
unusual way 15 years ago. His
nephew was a student here before
the war, World War II, but he drop-
ped out to serve in the Army Air
Force. When the war ended, the
nephew came back to W&L and
found the Corner Grill vacant. Doc
was living in Akron, Ohio, and
wasn’t interested in returning to
the drug business. The nephew call-
ed him, he came down during Christ-
mas and signed the contract. He
moved here in March, 1945. As Doc
put it, “I didn’t expect to be here
this long, didn’t think I could put up
with Virginians for 15 years.” But
he has, and seems to be happy with
the Virginians, except for the beer
license bit.

Registered Pharmacist

Doe is a registered pharmacist in
Ohio, He graduated from the Uni-
versity of Cincinnati just a few
years after it was formed. His son
is a Kentucky Colonel, and Doc
proudly displays a key to a Ken-
tucky city which he obtained through
his son who was then a field sec-
retary for Sigma Chi.

That in brief is the story of The
Corner Grill. The only question
that bothers the writer is this: What
will WXL and VMI, and indeed, the
city of Lexington, do with another
pool hall if Doc’s downstairs beer
license doesn’t come through?

 

Notice

Mr. D. E. Brady, Jr., Superinten-
dent of Buildings and Grounds,
announced that all students who
have failed to register their automo-
biles by October 1, 1960 will be sub-
ject to a loss of driving privileges
for a minimum of six months.

In order for a student to register
his automobile, he must have a val-
id operator’s permit from his home
state. The W&L tags may be ob-
tained at the office of the school
proctor, Bob Murray, at no charge
to the student.

To date, there are 431 cars regis-
tered with approximately 100 not
registered.

5-Star Generals Face Dickinson Saturday

Coach To Hurl

Ground Game

At Red Devils’ 200-Pound Line

It’s been two yeers now since a
Rebel team from Washington and
Lee hes been to Carlisle, Pennsyl- |
vania—and Our Generals feel that
it’s hithtime that our Northern ad-
vers?ries received a good taste of
Southern Hospitality. Unfortunately, |
however, the last time that we ven-|
tured up the Shenandoah Valley |
and reeched that fair city, things |
didn’t turn out so well.

However, after last year—and a |
42-12 victory—the Red Devils have
a new-found respect for Coach |
Lee McLaughlin and the General
Go-T offense.

Washington and Lee’s forces will
be seeking their second win of the
1960 campaign, while Dickinson’s
Red Devils will be making their de- |
but. There is certain doubt as to!
whether or not there is a mutual
advantage to this situation.

As McLaughlin points out, “We
hope we will have corrected some
of those traditional first game mis-
takes, but then again, Dickinson had
a chance to see us last Saturday,
and at least they'll know what to
expect.

We might pause briefly here, and
ask ourselves exactly what did their
scouts witness, after having traveled
all the way to scenic Lexington for
this first game. Well, it is quite
probable that they reported back
on a W&L offense that struck twice
for 47-yard touchdowns in our 21-6
win over Centre, and generally gave
the impression of break-away poten-
tial.

They also observed a shaky pass
defense, a failure to gain on im-
portant short-yardage plays, and a
failure to exploit fully Centre’s de-
fensive set-ups. These flaws, how-
ever, could be construed as “tra-
ditional first game mistakes,” and
those which have been improved
upon with a week’s practice.

McLaughlin is cautious about the
Red Devils when he recalls that
passing played such an important
role in the Generals’ win last year.

“We felt that quarterback Jack
Groner was the big difference in
that game, and of course, Jack is
gone,” says the W&L coach.

Helping to take up the passing
slack this season will be quarter-
backs Steve Suttle and Phil Sharp.
Suttle completed only one of three
against Centre, but it was a 47-
yard scoring toss. Sharp threw only
once and it was a 20-yard comple-
tion.

Dickinson has 18 lettermen back
from last year’s team which won one,
lost seven. Among the better backs
returning are sophomore quarter-
backs Don Brominski and Reno Di-
Oro, both competent passers. Top
runners promise to be seniors Jan
Skladany and Ken Campbell, and
sophomore Louis Verdelli.

Heavy Line
On the forward wall, the Red
Devils have an experienced line
centered around a pair of giant
tackles; a 210 pound center who is
also a candidate for all-state honors;
and a pair of seasoned guards. There

 

are elso four lettermen returning |
et the end slot this year, and some ©

of us m>y remember one of these—

Roger Smith who moved his 210
pounds on an 87-yard touchdown
run after an interception in last year’s
contest.

All of this points to a rather solid
well over which Steve Suttle, Bob
Funkhouser, Jim Russ, and Doug
Martin will have to go if they plen
to rezoch pay dirt on the ground.

McLaughlin says he will continue
to use three alternating units on
otense and defense. His “blue” or
first unit backfield will include
qu?rterback Steve Suttle, halfbacks
Bob Funkhouser and Jim Russ, and
pony-size fullback Doug Martin,
the big ground-gainer against Centre
with 118 yards and 12 carries. All
were starters in 1959.

Anchor man for the W&L defense,
which limited Centre to 2.6 yards a
carry, will be junior linebacker
Terry Fohs, a 145-pound mighty
mite who contributed 19 stops against
Centre.

All in all, our Generals will be
up against a rather tough squad,
and determination should prove to
be the margin of victory. We have
one factor in our favor, however, and
that is that Dickinson fears our
depth and experience. As _ their
Coach told his boys, “In Washington
and Lee, we face one of the toughest
foes on our schedule.”

Seven freshmen and seven upper-
classmen advanced to the second
round of W&L’s annual fall tennis
tournament this week.

Tennis coach Bill Washburn, who
eagerly watched several of the tour-
ney’s matches, was highly pleased
with the entrants’ play.

He said the enthusiasm and caliber
of play displayed by the entrants
pointed toward a strengthening of
W&L’s tennis team.

Freshmen Steve Parel and Jud
Reis were the only two players
forced to go three sets for a win.

Both lost their first set and had
to fight gruelling, uphill battles.
Parel rocked Pete McMurtrie, 5-7,
8-6, 6-4; and Reis outlasted George
Paul, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.

Soccer Team Meets Randolph-Macon
Monday, Seeks Second Win of Season

The Washington and Lee Soccer
Generals travel Monday to Ashland,
Va., for their second contest of the
season. Randolph-Macon, a perenial
and dangerous opponent, will play
host to W&L as our booters seek
their second win in as many starts.
Last Monday, the Blue and White

a stunning 4-0 victory.

lost several outstanding players
through graduation, and injuries are
slowly taking their toll this season.

One particularly sour note has
been sounded as Coach Joe Lyles
learned that his starting right wing-
man Steve Hawkins, who scored two
of the four goals in Monday’s game,
will probably be unable to do battle
with Randolph-Macon.

Also on the disabled list, but ex-
pected to play on Monday is Co-
captain Frank Smith. “The Horse”
has been hampered all week with a
bad leg injury, but Coach Lyles feels
that Frank will be ready on Monday.

Coach Joe Lyles has been stress-
ing the importance of fundamentals
this past week in an attempt to cor-
rect any of those “traditional first
game mistakes” that were evident in
last Monday’s contest, for as he
pointed out, “We'll beat a team every

Woodberry is also 1-0 for the year,
and W&L’s promising youngsters are
looking for a strong test by the
prennial prep school power.

Freshman coach Hal Bates, a for-
mer William and Mary end, is hop-
ing for more offensive fireworks
from halfback Henry Sackett. The
former E. C. Glass football star gave
the Brigadiers 14 points toward their
20-0 win over Hargrave Military

Bates had additional praise for half-
back Stuart Yoffe and quarterback
John McDaniel. They teamed up in

Student Service Society Elects
Nine Members For Coming Year

The Student Service Society se-
lected nine men for membership at
its meeting last Tuesday night in
the Student Union. They were chosen
from among the 45 people who were
interviewed.

Five of the men picked were
juniors and four were sophomores.
The juniors include Peter Agelasto,
Phi Psi; Jerome Dattel, ZBT; David
Knight, Phi Delt; Kenneth Jones,
Beta; and Stephen Rutledge, Phi
Gam. The sophomores were Charles
Hart, Phi Psi; Daniel Markstein,
ZBT; David Montgomery, Delt; and
Robert Young, Phi Delt.

The new members will assist the
Student Service Society in its usual

functions. SSS takes prospective
freshmen and their parents on a
tour of the W&L campus. They also |
assist the University during Parents’ |
Weekend, Alumni reunions, SIPA |
conventions and _ interviews for
Robert E. Lee scholarship prospects.
Already members of the SSS are
Don Partington, president; Don
Rhinesmith, vice-president; and
Steve Galef, secretary. Other mem-
bers are Ned Ames, Dick Kuerstein-
er, Dave Lefkowitz, Dich Sharlin
and Jim Vann. Also members are
Pearce Hardwick, Jim Russ, Phil
Sharp, and George Van Sciver.
Partington announced that the SSS
will hold a meeting on Wed., Oct. 5.

laying it out, prescribing its curricu-
lum and generally getting the pro-
ject started. There were some good
people on the board—James Madison,
Spencer Roane, James Breckenridge
and men like that. The board met in
August of 1818 at a tavern in Rock-
fish Gap and quickly agreed that its
first job was to decide where to lo-
cate the University of Virginia.

The localities bidding for the new
university were Charlottesville,
Staunton and, of all places, Lexing-
ton, which was already the site of
Washington College.

Jefferson described for the Gen-
eral Aessembly the almost frantic
(and I would say most unbecoming)
efforts of the people of Lexington
and Rockbridge county to get the
new university located in their town.

He reported that John Robinson of
Rockbridge county offered to will
to the state more than 3,000 acres
of land as a site for the university.

And this is Jefferson’s account of
the abject proposal of Washington
College and the people of the com-
munity: “The board of trustees of
Washington College have also pro-
posed to transfer the whole of their
funds, viz. 100 shares in the funds
of the James River company, 31
acres of land on which all the build-
ings stand, their philosophical ap-
paratus, their expected interest in the
funds of the Cincinnati society; the
libraries of the Graham and Wash-
ington societies; and $3,000 in cash,
on condition that a reasonable pro-
vision be made for the present pro-
fessors. A subscription had also been
offered by the people of Lexington
and its vicinity, amounting to
17 876. ...

In other words, Bill, they were
trying to sell us out, bag, baggage
and philosophical apparatus, to the
Wahoos.

Actually it was worse than that.
They were trying to give our Alma
Mater away, and they were willing
to pay the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia to take it off their hands. (It is
even more crushing to realize that
Jefferson and his board declined
the offer.)

This episode in history was never
mentioned to me in all the time I
lived and went to college in Lex-
ington. Why were we not taught
about it in history class? Why were
our professors not willing to level
with us and tell us the worst?

It is difficult to realize even as I

good people of Lexington were try-
ing to junk Washington College even
before General Lee arrived, not to
mention you and me and countless
innocent alumni.

I am only grasping at straws, but
is it possible that this account in
Niles’ Register is a fraud? Could it
be only a joke that Jefferson was
playing on us—a frivolous lampoon
that he shipped off to the magazine?
(He was the original Wahoo, you
know.)

Can you possibly reassure the
alumni in this matter? Say it ain’t
so, Bill.

Sincerely,
CHARLEY McDOWELIL

Dr. Pusey Speaks To Frosh;
Encourages Participation

Last Tuesday evening Dean W. W.
Pusey stated to the Freshmen in a
speech entitled “The Next Four
Years,” that the prime purpose of
a college education should be the
Maximum development of the stu-
dent’s intellectual abilities. In view
of the past record of the class, he
urged them all to live up to their
potentiality in their performance.

Dean Pusey spoke of unlimited
challenge offered by our libraries,
class rooms, and laboratories, and
enumerated the fields of study avail-
able at Washington and Lee.

He called attention to certain by-
products which, in his opinion are
among the marks of an educated
man. Among these are a rational ap-
proach to problems; intellectual hu-
mility, distrust of total answers,
independence of judgment, humor
to temper, seriousness of purpose,
and time for quiet contemplation.

In conclusion he stated that a
college, and in particular Washington
and Lee, offers its students the op-
portunity and the guidance so that
they can learn to live as educated,
well-informed, imaginative citizens
and individuals. This opportunity
will not come again for the fresh-
men, he added and it is up to them to
grasp the opportunity and exploit
it to its fullest.

 

New Members Picked
By Mongolian Minks

The Mongolian Minks, an honor-
ary Washington and Lee social fra-
ternity, has recently elected twenty-
four members for the year 1960-61.
At a meeting held last Tuesday
night, the new members were de-
cided upon, and four members from
each of six fraternities on campus
were elected.

Newly elected are Phi Delts Park
Gilmore, Billy Cobbs, John Gulick,
and Chuck Vance. From the KA
house are John Mullin, John Cheath-
am, Tom Rankin, and Roy Good-
win. SAE new members are John
Amos, Wat Johnston, Dave Caruth-
ers, and Bill Bowen. From Sigma
Nu house are John Harcourt, Henry
Knight, Glen Fidler, and Ron
Scharnberg. New Betas are Cal de
Coligny, Peter Barber.

New from the ZBT house are Joel
Goozh, Mike Sussman, Art Portnoy,
and Firth Spiegel.

Formal initiation for the new
members will be held in the near
future.

ball game was not as good as it could
have been, it was still an improve-

since the Washington and Lee stu-
dents now have something to cheer
for in the way of a football team,
perhaps the cherleaders will have
someone to lead.

Fulbrights Speak

(Continued from page 2)

Being the youngest of the three,
Hroch will have several more years
of study in Vienna or Salzburg be-
fore he can practice law. His father
is a physician in his native town.

All three students were struck by
the size of Lexington and the large
number of stores here as compared
to their homes.

On edueational matters, both Turk
and Hroch were “amazed at the
amount of planning Americans do
for their educations in a college.”

Ole Southern Drawl

Antoniades had an_ interesting
comment on the understanding of
spoken English: “The only trouble I
have in understanding Americans
is when I am talking to people who
have what you call a Southern
drawl,” he said.

All three of the exchange students
feel that they should take a second
look at American college fraternities.
The German and the Austrian are
used to fraternities, but they voiced
the opinion that “American fraterni-
ties interfere too much with a stu-
dent’s private affairs.”

Seem Foolish

Antoniades says fraternities, as he
has seen them and heard and read
about them seems “foolish.”

“It’s like paying to get in a certain
group,” he said.

None of the three students chose
Washington and Lee as the American
college they wanted to attend. Under
Fulbright Commission regulations
they had only the right to name a
region of the country they should
like. They were in turn assigned
here.

 

Homecoming Nears
(Continued from page 1)

The highlight of the game will be
the crowning of the Washington
and Lee Homecoming Queen for 1960.
The queen is chosen by faculty mem-
bers from entries submitted by the
fraternities.

A crowd exceeding 350 alumni and
guests is expected to be on hand
when the Generals meet the Diplo-
mats of Franklin and Marshall Col-
lege.

Disciplinary Groups Distrusted

(Continued from page 2)
whether one could turn his room-
mate in or not, but it is whether you
are doing your part to fulfill the con-
tract that you made with W&L.

The University has the right to
demand that a person fulfill his part
of this contract, and the purpose
of these committees is to insure that
the university’s interests are pro-
tected. These traditions are plainly
stated in the catalogue and, con-
sequently no student need ever come
to Washington and Lee not willing
to support them. She tells you what
she has to offer you in the way of
courses and excellent professors,
but she also tells you what she ex-
pects; and the fact of your presence
here testifies that you are prepared
to do your utmost to meet these ex-
pectations.

Understand, the various commit-
tees are not made up simply to har-
rass the student body and support
a structure of burdensome restric-
trictions. Rather, these committees
stand ready to protect those ideas
that the University cherishes and to
punish those who are living here
under the false idea that all they
are required to do is take with no
reciprocating obligation. The pres-
ence of these committees does not
indicate that the system has fallen
down or that time has marched on,

rendering the basic concepts of this
college passe.

They do not exist to maintain
a structure that has long-since lost
its vitality. The purpose of their ex-
istenee is to insure that the majority
of the students, who entered W&L
under certain basic assumptions and
who have loved the University be-
eause she has held these assump-
tions inviolatible, will not be frus-
trated by the few ‘bad apples’ that
are unwilling or unable to measure
up to their obligations.

The committees, then, should be
loked on as the guardians of all that
we hold sacred and should be aided
and supported by every student in
the University.

THE PLEDGE YOU SAVE
MAY BE YOUR OWN

Today’s column is directed at those young female under-
graduates who have recently pledged sororities and are wor-
ried, poor lambs, that they won’t make good. Following is a
list of simple instructions which, if faithfully observed, will
positively guarantee that you will be a mad success as a

sorority girl.

First, let us take up the matter of housemothers. The
housemother is your friend, your guide, your mentor. You
must treat her with respect. When you wish to speak to her,
address her as “‘Mother Sigafoos” or ‘‘Ma’am.” In no circum-
stances must you say, ‘‘Hey, fat lady.”

Second, let us discuss laundry. Never hang your wash on
the front porch of the sorority house. This is unsightly and
shows a want of breeding. Use the Chapter Room.

Third, meals. Always remember that planning and preparing
meals for a houseful of healthy girls is no simple task. Your
cook goes to a great deal of trouble to make your menu varied
and nourishing. The least you can do is show your apprecia-
tion. Don’t just devour your food; praise it. Exclaim with
delight, ‘‘What delicious pork jowls!” or “What a yummy soup
bone!” or “What scrumptious fish heads!’ or “What clear

water!”

Fourth, clothing. Never forget that your appearance re-
flects not just on yourself but on the whole house. It was
well enough before you joined a sorority to lounge around
campus in your old middy blouse and gym bloomers, but now
you must take great pains to dress in a manner which excites
admiring comments from all who observe you. A few years ago,
for example, there was a Chi Omega named Camille Ataturk
at the University of Iowa who brought gobs of glory to all her
sorors. Camille hit on the ingenious notion of suiting her garb
to the class she was attending. For instance, to English Lit she
wore a buskin and jerkin. To German she wore lederhosen and
carried a stein of pilsener. To Econ she wore 120 yards of
ticker tape. Her shiningest hour came one day when she
dressed as a white mouse for Psych Lab. Not only her Chi
Omega sisters, but the entire student body went into deep
mourning when she was killed by the janitor’s cat.

Finally, let us take up the most important topic of all. I

refer, of course, to dating.

As we have seen, the way you dress reflects on your sorority
but the men you date reflect even more. Be absolutely certain
that your date is an acceptable fellow. Don’t beat about the
bush ; ask him point-blank, “Are you an acceptable fellow?”
Unless he replies, “Yeah, hey,” send him packing,

But don’t just take his word that he is acceptable. Inspect
him closely. Are his fingernails clean? Is his black leather
jacket freshly oiled? Is his ukelele in tune? Does he carry

publie liability insurance? And,

he smoke Marlboros?

most significant of all, does

If he’s a Marlboro man, you know he has taste and discern-
ment, wit and wisdom, character and sapience, decency and
warmth, presence and poise, talent and grit, filter and flavor
soft pack and flip-top box. You will be proud of him your
sorority will be proud of him, the makers of Marlboro will be
proud of him, and I will be paid for this column,

The makers of Marlboro, having paid for this column, would
like to mention another of their fine cigarettes—mild, un-
filtered Philip Morris—available in regular size or the sensa-
tional new king-size Commander. Have a Commander—

welcome aboard.
