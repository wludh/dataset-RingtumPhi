Shumate Elected President At SIPA Convention

By ROY GOODWIN
Editor

William Louis (Mo) Shu-
mate, of Orange County High
School in Orange, Va., was
elected president at the 32nd

annual SIPA Convention this
afternoon.

Shumate will serve as SIPA pres-
ident until the next time the Con-
vention meets, in 1962.

Returns from the polls, which
closed at noon, indicated early this
morning that Shumate was the ob-
vious winner.

Running second to Shumate in the
balloting was Harry Nurkin, of Dur-
ham High School, Durham, N. C.

Shumate, a senior at Orange High,
will attend Woodberry Forest School
in Orange on a full scholarship dur-
ing the 1961-62 term. He plans to
attend Hampden-Sydney College.

As editor of Hoofprints this year,
Shumate was president of the Math
Club, a member of the National
Honor Society, and a member of the
varsity baseball, basketball, and foot-
ball teams. He was co-captain of
the varsity basketball team this year.

During his sophomore year at
Orange High, he was elected presi-
dent of his class.

Nurkin, a 17-year-old student at
Durham High School, will be editor
of Hi-Rocket next year.

A member of Quill and Scroll, he
will be a member of the student
council next year. He is an honor
roll student.

Finishing third in the balloting
was John Hoover, of Elkview High
School, Elkview, W. Va. He was
trailed by Edward Lee Lucas, of
duPont High School, Louisville, Ky.

Finishing fifth was Johnny David-
son of Bristol, Va. Fig Newton re-
ceived six votes in the balloting.

‘Home Edition’ Serves Both School And Community) ,

March 1 this year marked the
anniversary of the first full year of
broadcasting by the latest addition
to W&L’s radio and television ac-
tivities, Radio Washington and Lee.

Broadcasting every Monday
through Friday night from the Jour-
nalism Department studios from 8:05
to 9:00, it is the final result of
thinking among both students and
faculty members for some time that
radio activities on campus should be
expanded in this general direction.

Radio Washington and Lee can
trace its origin back to a program
called “Kaleidoscope,” still heard as
part of the Radio W&L lineup,
which was begun back in 1956 by a
man who was then a Washington and
Lee student and now a professor in
the Journalism Department, Mr.
John K. Jennings.

From its formal beginnings, just
over a year ago, Radio Washington
and Lee has offered a variety of
musical and other types of en-
tertainment to cover almost every
aspect of the listener’s taste.

Monday’s program, “Pro Musica,”
offers the best in classical music, and

and local news, and is the last news |
program of the evening carried by
WREL.

Local news is covered by mem-
bers of Washington and Lee’s Jour-
nalism Department with each stu-
dent covering a “beat” for two se-| |
mesters while attending the Univer-
sity. Other stories arrive by As-
sociated Press teletype.

All stories for the show are re-
written by members of each of the |
five nightly staffs in order to pro-|/|
duce a program of sound format | #*
and consistent style. The more than |
twenty members of the Home Edi-
tion staff often find themselves cov- |
ering a late breaking story, tape re-| |
cording Radio Moscow for “the other
side of the story,” or accompanying |
a student on “beats” in order to get |

‘Radio W&L’ Celebrates Successful Y ear;
Top-N otch Programs Get Much Response

“Concert” follows on Tuesday
nights with music of a somewhat less
serious nature in providing the type
sounds usually classified as semi-
classical. “Concert’s” producer is
Steve Guild, a sophomore from
Oklahoma City, Okla.

Moving more toward the theme of
informality, Wednesday night’s “Pat-
terns” offers a combination of popu-
lar music, in the traditional, blend-
ed with the more popular type jazz,
with a touch of contemporary fun-
ny men like Bob Newhart, Jonathan
Winters, and others. A senior from
Fort Worth, Tex., Harvey Allen is
the show’s producer.

Radio W&L’s old timer, “Kaleido-
scope,” comes to life every Thurs-
day night, presenting everything
from a strictly documentary type
program to radio plays or comic
take-offs on such network programs
as “Monitor.” Senior Bob Holley of
Moorestown, New Jersey, is the
producer.

Getting back to the strictly musi-
cal side, the week of programs is

Girl With Curly Hair
Baffles SIPA Delegates
In Current Events Quiz

Frieda, the girl with naturally
curly hair and Charles Halleck came
in for some amusing word play on
the SIPA current events quiz this
year.

Only two of the SIPA students
correctly identified Frieda, but those
who attempted answers and failed
came up with some naturally con-
cieved witicisms.

Hugh Moore, of McCallie High
School, Chattanooga, Tenn., cap-
tured top honors in the quiz yes-
terday. He won with a score of
90—the highest ever recorded.

The little girl of the comic page
was variously described as an ani-
mal given to Caroline Kennedy, a
horse, a Russian dog orbited around
the world, the name of the year’s
best play and Kennedy’s physician.

And Dirksen and Halleck, who
have acquired the team name of
Ev and Charlie as a result of a
recent series of TV interviews, turn-
ed up as comic strip characters, TV
stars and a radio program. But the
strangest description of the two Con-
gressmen was an elaborate answer
that placed the two as the creators
and performers in the “Fibber Mc-
Gee and Molly Show” on old-time
radio. Ev, the answer noted, played
the part of Molly, and died recently.

P. Mitchell turned up as the movie

On Friday afternoon, the delegates
were treated to an exhibition of an
artist’s skill by Jack Mendelsohn,
syndicated cartoonist of Jacky’s
Diary.

A professional cartoonist since he
was sixteen, Mendelsohn has tried
to capture in this his latest creation
the child’s eye view of the world. He
feels that with this format he can
treat “things that are as a general
rule taboo in a newspaper.”

His object, he says, is not to
sneak in by the back door, but
rather to poke innocent fun at
some of the things of the world that
are strange and deserve a_ spoof.

$250,000 To Go For J- -School Renovation

Reid Hall To

The end is in sight for the major
problem that has been facing the
Washington and Lee University De-
partment of Journalism and Com-
munications since it was founded
here by Robert E. Lee a little less
than 100 years ago.

One of the relatively few depart-
ments of its type to be fully ac-
credited by the American Council
of Education for Journalism, W&L
is rated in competition with the best
and largest schools of Journalism
throughout the country, but suffers
considerably from lack of space, es-
pecially for many “laboratory”
needs.

The University, however, is cur-
rently holding a $2,000,000 fund rais-
ing campaign to improve present fa-
cilities and for the construction
of new buildings. Approximately
$250,000 of the money to be raised in
this year-long campaign will be used
for the improvement of the journal-
ism facilities.

Many of the 20 journalism courses
offered here have “laboratory”
needs: professional city and wire
rooms; a better radio broadcasting
studio (and eventually television);
photographic darkrooms for class
use; as well as the usual classrooms,
faculty offices, library and adminis-
trative space.

The department of journalism here
was the first college-level instruc-

 

Be Remodeled

tion of its type offered anywhere in
the world. In addition to its regular
curriculum the department also con-
ducts certain major external enter-
prises and services to the news-
paper and broadcasting professions.

The Southern Interscholastic Press
Association was founded here in
1925 and an SIPA Convention is held
annually on the W&L campus. The
department has also been charged
by the Alfred duPont Awards Foun-
dation with supervision in the tele-
communications field.

For the many-faceted program, the

faculty in journalism does the best} |

it can with improvised quarters
scattered among three buildings. The
department has a “makeshift” city

room, no audio-visual room for the| }

course which make large use of films
and slides, only partial broadcast-
ing facilities, not enough offices for
the faculty, and a lack of storage
space.

The journalism side of the ex-
pansion plans calls for a remodeling
of the present Reid Hall for both
journalism and _pre-engineering.
This is to be a complete rebuilding
of the interior for the sake of more
flexible arrangement of rooms and
elimination of the present wasted
space in the middle of the building.
The ground floor will be devoted
largely to the Journalism Laboratory
Press, while the upper floors will

contain a regular newspaper city
room and wire room, broadeasting
room, photographic darkrooms, as
well as conventional classrooms and
offices.

O. W. Riegel, head of the depart-
ment since 1930, envisions the pro-

 

ject as a “communications arts”
building bringing under one roof the
following activities and facilities:

1) Classrooms and offices for basic
instruction and research programs
related to the mass media, public
opinion and advertising.

 

2) Auxiliary professional facili-
ties, including news, printing, adver-
tising and film laboratories, wire
room, radio and television studios
and photographic darkrooms.

3) Accommodations for profes-
sional seminars.

4) Offices for external service fun-

tions such as administration of the]:

duPont radio-television awards and
the SIPA.

5) Specialized library and reading

6) Offices for student publications,
such as the Southern Collegian, The

Plans for the improvement cam-
paign call for construction to get
underway upon the completion of
new dormitory and science facilities
which are scheduled to be open the
beginning of the 1962-63 school year.

Five professional journalists visited
the campus this year, interviewing
junior and senior journalism majors
for possible positions during the
summer and upon graduation. They
included W. F. Clingman, Jr., per-
sonnel director of the Piedmont
Publishing Co., Winston-Salem, N.
C., Vint Jennings, managing editor
of the Charleston (W. Va.) Daily
Mail, William G. Leverty, assistant
managing editor of the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, and R. K. T. “Kit”
Larson and Cameron Gregory, rep-

O.W. Riegel, Head Of Journalism Department, Is Propaganda Expert

A familiar sight at SIPA con-
ventions since 1931 is Prof. O. W.
Riegel, Director of the Lee Me-
morial Journalism Foundation and
professor of journalism at W&L.

An authority on psychological
warfare and propaganda, Mr. Riegel
is working on a research project
which he began in Europe three
years ago. Working under the Ful-
bright student and scholar exchange
program’s research grant, he was
studying certain aspects of interna-
tional communications.

 

With his wife and four children,
Mr. Riegel traveled to Paris and
other European capitals to get ma-
terial for his study.

Mr. Riegel has an _ impressive
background of both governmental
and academic experience. Currently,
he is a member of the Executive
Bureau of the International Asso-
ciation for Communications Re-
search, which has its headquarters
in Paris.

SIPA—1961

For 32 years, high school journalists have convened at
Washington and Lee University for the annual meeting of the
Southern Interscholastic Press Association. During the two
days the delegates attend lectures, panel discussions, class ses-
sions and short courses, clinics and informal get-togethers to
learn a little more about their hoped-for vocation (or already

elected avocation) , journalism.

The SIPA Convention has contributed much to newspaper,
yearbook and magazine standards in secondary schools through-
out the South. Each year the size of the convention has grown
and in a like manner, the improvements in high school journal-
ism in the South have increased.

Two of the primary reasons for having this convention are
these: (1) to provide a meeting place for high school journal-
ists where they can discuss their problems and ideas as well
as get first hand information from distinguished lecturers; (2)
to create through the presentation of annual awards to the top
publications a competition and thus a continual effort to im-

prove publications.

If General Robert E. Lee were alive today, he would be
quite proud of the advances made in college-level journalism
instruction. His “dream” of 1869 was laughed at, but if he

could see the activities of the SIPA, he would definitely be the ||

one to have the last laugh.

Many persons’ efforts have gone into the preparation,
planning, and operation of this year’s convention. The mem-
bers of the Washington and Lee University Department of
Communications, the W&L Chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, na-
tional journalistic society, the members of the W&L Labora-
tory Press, and the Administration of Washington and Lee
University have all had their share in this year’s SIPA Conven-

tion.

The Ring-tum Phi hopes that these efforts have not fallen
on deaf ears, and that the delegates to the 32nd SIPA Conven-
tion have gained much experience and knowledge from this

meeting.

As the delegates to this convention return to their respec-
tive homes and schools, we would like to remind them that
many persons have become inspired to go on into journalism
from conventions such as this one. We hope that many of you
will become inspired to continue your efforts in journalism,
and that some of you will even become professional journalists.

Much of the success of this convention lies in the attitude
of the many people who have had a part in its operation. We
welcome you to SIPA, and hope that you have gained from
it. This is our hope—and our plea.

psychological warfare and propa-
ganda. He has also written The Story
of the NWR Propaganda, Crown of
Glory, and The Life of James J.

and many articles for periodicals.

Mr. Riegel came to W&L in 1930,
and became director of the Lee Me-
morial Journalism Foundation in
1934. Before coming to W&L, he had
been an English instructor at Dart-
mouth. He holds degrees from Wis-
consin and Columbia.

During World War II, Mr. Riegel

three months in West Germany for
the State Department, making a
special study of public opinion re-
search and training.

 

In 1951 he worked in Europe un-

JOHN K. JENNINGS

Mr. John K. Jennings, an instruc-
tor in journalism at W&L, has the
busy job of Executive Director of
SIPA. This position is a year-round
operation since the planning for an
SIPA convention must start as soon
as the previous year’s activity is
finished.

The first contacts with this year’s
delegates got underway last No-
vember when 2,500 postcards were
mailed to interested people. The big
mailing came in January, when reg-
istration forms, bulletins, and an-

*|nouncements for the State Scholas-
: tic Press Association Awards were

Meanwhile, the Advisory Com-

The special SIPA edition of the
Ring-tum Phi and the official ac-

were both printed in a small shop
on the Washington and Lee campus
under the direction of C. Harold
Lauck, “America’s Baskerville Print-
er.”

Mr. Lauck received the title
“America’s Baskerville Printer,” sev-
eral years ago as a result of national
recognition for his skillful use of
Baskerville type.

Since his middle teens, he has
been connected with the printing
business, and next year he will be-

Assisting Mr. Lauck are Lynwood
Pullen, Edward Backus, Edwin Wal-
ker and Charles Perfetti. This five-
man printing team is responsible
not only for the printing of the
Ring-tum Phi but most of W&L’s
campus publications, posters and

 

pamphlets.

W&L Journalism Lab Press
Headed By C. Harold Lauck

 

Following an issue of the W&L

newspaper through the print shop,
the first person concerned with the
copy is the Lynotype operator, Lyn-
wood Pullen. Often Mr. Pullen must
double in his duties and act as proof
reader and copy editor.

Next, the type goes to Edward
Backus, the print shop’s chief com-
positor. Mr. Backus formerly ran
his own print shop in Buena Vista
and annually teaches a newspaper
short course to SIPA delegates.

Edwin Walker is probably the most
versatile man in the shop. In addi-
tion to assisting Mr. Backus, he
operates the shop’s two smaller
presses, cast plates for pictures and
newspaper advertisements, and oper-
ates the machine which folds news-
papers after they come off the press.

The completed forms, ready for
printing, go to pressman Charlie
Perfetti, a graduate of Rochester
Institute of Technology School of
Printing.

Mr. Lauck’s work is not confined
only to the shop. He conducts classes
for the journalism foundation, teach-
ing journalism students the rudi-
ments of type-setting and printing,
and explaning the various machines
used in production of printed mater-
ials.

The list of awards won by Mr.|;

Lauck’s typography efforts is an im-
pressive one. In the Inland Printer,
the printing industry’s leading trade
journal, Mr. Lauck has been fea-
tured as one of the nation’s top-flight
craftsmen.

He is a past president of the In- ‘

ternational Graphic Arts Education
Association and several years ago
was awarded a Distinguished Serv-
ice Citation at the annual SIPA
awards banquet “in recognition of
outstanding accomplishments in the
field of scholastic publishing and in
acknowledgement of devotion and
effective service to journalism, to
education, and to youth.”

Only last year Mr. Lauck received
the honor of being elected a fellow
of the Royal Society of Arts and

 

Crafts in London.

Paxton Davis Is 1961
Short Courses Director;
Joined Faculty in 1953

Paxton Davis, associate professor
of journalism at W&L, is serving
as director of SIPA’s short courses
again this year.

A member of the journalism facul-
ty since 1953, Davis is the author of
the novel Two Soldiers, and has also
published several short stores and
novel exceprts.

In 1956 Davis was a Fellow in
Fiction of the Bread Loaf Writers
Conference, a literary organization
in Vermont which stimulates the
exchange of ideas between novelists
and prospective writers.

Mr. Davis had four years of news-
paper experience on the Winston-
Salem Journal and Sentinel, and the

flowed into the Journalism Depart-
ment.
When the entry forms and publica-

_| tions arrived, they were classified
-|and judged, and certificates were

made for the winners.

This is the second year Jennings
has served as the Executive Direc-
tor of SIPA. He also helped with
convention when he was a student
at W&L.

“The delegates can profit the most
from a free exchange of advise
among themselves,” he stated. “This
convention is a good place to work
out problems, because most prob-
lems that arise in school publica-
tions aren’t unique to any one
school.”

To prospective journalists, he
warns: “Too many people in high
school who want to be journalists
think only of writing. They have to
read—read everything they can get
their hands on.” From reading, he
added, comes the store of background
knowledge which is vital to good re-
porting.

“Journalists have to be interested
in people,” he continued, “the peo-
ple they are reaching as well as
the people who are their sources.

“They must know how, and be
willing, to communicate to these
people, not just set before them a
series of facts.”

1956 Graduate of W&L

Jennings, a 1956 journalism grad-
uate of W&L, has worked with
WDBJ-TV in Roanoke, and the
Armed Forces radio while he was in
the Army. Among his Armed Forces
radio assignments were the Geneva
nuclear talks, the Brussels World
Fair, an interview with Mikoyan,
and the Council of Europe meeting.

He was a senior editor of Home
Edition and executive producer of
Kaleidoscope while a _ student at
W&L. He became an instructor and
director of the Communications Lab-
atory, Lee Journalism Foundation, in
1959,

Mr. Jennings is a native of
Fayetteville, Tennessee. His hobbies
are Little Theatre work and pho-
tography.

SIPA Founded In 1925;
First Meet Held in 1926

One of the most interesting stories
concerning the Southern Interscho-
lastic Press Association is its history.
Founded in 1925, SIPA is sponsored
by the Lee Memorial Journalism
Foundation to extend to high schools
and preparatory schools of the South
the high idealism for Southern
journalism which moved Robert E.
Lee, when he was president of
Washington College (now Washing-
ton and Lee University).

The first convention of SIPA was
held on April 5 and 6, 1926,

SIPA Girls’ Opinions Differ On W&L Life

By COUNTRY WILLIE MARTIN
and PLAUSIBLE PAUL PLAWIN

Each year they come, turning the
rolling green lawns into a madhouse
of crinoline, perfume, glaring bright
dresses and wide blinking eyes.

They are the SIPA girls.

They talk about “all the boys” and
fraternity houses and parties and
“all that stuff, you know.” And in
between all this they go to seminars
on how to make advertising dollars
count and how to take yearbook
pictures.

According to the SIPA Handbook
they’re here to learn how to make
next year’s school paper and year-
book more popular with their read-
ers.

Most come here to work,
there are some exceptions.

“We're here to have a party,”
chimed Ruth Clark, Melinda Cole-
man and Esther Johnson from little
ole Junis H. Rose High School in
Greenville, Nawth Calina.

“T’ye heard Washington and Lee
has 500 boys,” said pretty little Me-
linda, whose intent in that remark
wasn’t centered around yearbook
makeup lore. But none of the under-
class girls back at Junius H. Rose
wanted to come, the girls explained,
so they came again as seniors.

And what does pretty, blue-eyed

but

 

Maria Deveiney of East Mecklen-
burg High School down around
Charlotte, N. C., think about the fra-
ternity party aspect of the SIPA
weekend?

“Shot ... charge!”

And if she’s invited to a fraternity
house—“Oh, gosh, I won’t go in
alone.”

But lest this sound like the SIPA
girls roam the Washington and Lee
campus in unbridled search for the
unknown world of fraternity house
basements and college sophomores,
a word is due about advisers.

These rugged teachers who shep-
herd their flocks of students away
from their school’s classrooms
for the weekend deserve at least a
round of applause. They must quick-
ly survey the town of Lexington and
the W&L campus and_ establish
strong boundaries beyond which
their charges must not go. And many
of them have been through the
ordeal more than once before.

One adviser confided that she had
a special reason for not allowing

her girls to enter into the world of|
fraternity house basements: It seems

she had been to SIPA as a student
before and lived safely through the
weekend under the fraternity ban.
Thus she knows very well the logic
of the rule.

  

Another adviser backed the fra-
ternity ban, but added a bit of re-
assurance about her girls. “They are

from Orange County High School
just up the Valley returned for a
second go as SIPA girls. And they
allowed as how they had to come
back to help their candidate for
president, Mo Shumate.

Of W&L men, Boots exclaimed:
“I think you can spot a W&L stu-
dent a mile away.”

Sighed Pat of the W&L scene:
“It’s kind of hard to express.”

The girls from George Washington
High School in Danville—Mary
Oakley, Robin Link, Kitty Evans
and Ellen Temple—said they were
here for a “little of both—parties
and work.”

Some of the random comments
of this sea of young ladies don’t
quite sound like the comments about
SIPA handbook’s seminar on “The
Selection and Implementation of the
Theme.” But then it’s spring.

On fraternities—“Boys .. . losts of
boys I'm not afraid to go
in...a blast... sorority girls like
them.” And a determined, “If we’re
asked, we'll go.”

On where they’re staying— Robert
E. Lee ... Mayflower .. . Green
Valley.” and a puzzled, “At some old
lady’s house.”

On why they came—‘“Seriously?
or for fun? Which would
prefer?”

constitution, recently ratified and
giving the District of Columbia a
presidential vote, this delegate noted
that it was “the amendment of the
Constitution after the 22nd.”

Of new U.S. ambassador to India
John Kenenth Galbraith, the same
student wrote—“son of Mr. and Mrs.
Galbraith.” But which Galbraiths?

Overall direction and coordination
of the Radio W&L staff is under
the executive directorship of Harvey
Allen. He is assisted by Nick Den-

Davis Heads Short Courses

(Continued from page 2)

He graduated from Johns Hopkins
in 1949, and worked with the Journal
until 1951, when he became a re-
porter for the Times-Dispatch. In
1952, he returned to Winston-Salem
to work for the Sentinal. Mr. Davis
has also been a book columnist for
the Roanoke Times.

A native of Winston-Salem, Davis
attended VMI before entering the
Army in World War II. He received
an A.B. in English from Johns
