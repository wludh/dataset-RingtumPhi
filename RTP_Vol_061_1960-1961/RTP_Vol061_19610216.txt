17 Students Tapped In Noon ODK Ceremony

The outstanding campus leaders of
W&L were honored today with an
ODK tap, the “greatest honor that
can come to you in this phase of
your life,” as H. Graham Morison
warned the student body against the
the threat of orthodoxy and con-
formity in life.

Mr. Morison, who attended Wash-
ington and Lee, both as an under-
graduate and as a student of law,
graduated with an LL.B. in 1932. He
was an outstanding student body
leader while at the University. Mr.
Morison was Assistant Attorney
General of the United States under
President Truman, where he receiv-
ed fame as the prosecutor in the
union coal strikes of 1948-1949.

The 1961 tap marks the 46th con-
vocation of the Washington and Lee
student body for the ODK cere-
monies. Omicron Delta Kappa, with
chapters at most of the leading col-
leges and universities of the nation,
was founded at Washington and Lee
in 1914 as an honorary leadership
fraternity.

Distinguished alumni Charles
Luther Claunch and Dr. George
Barksdale Craddock were also tapped
today. Mr. Claunch, a resident of
Chattanooga, Tenn., and a member
of the Class of ’27, is a lawyer in the
firm of Swafford and Claunch since
1945. He was born Feb. 7, 1906, and
was at W&L from 1923 to 1929, re-

 

ceiving the LL.B. degree in the lat-
ter year.

Dr. Craddock is a Captain in the
Army Medical Corps, and was a
member of the Class of ’30. He is a
member of SAE and presently resides
in Lynchburg, Va., as a physician.

Mr. Morison was also tapped dur-
ing the ceremony.

Plans For New Dorm Announced;

Should Be Ready

Washington and Lee University
announced today that it will build
a new, four-story dormitory, primar-
ily for freshmen, but with some ac-
commodations for upperclassmen.

President Fred C. Cole said the
new unit will house 91 students, and
is planned for occupancy in Sept.,
1962.

Plans for the building will be sub-
mitted to contractors for bids this
month, along with plans for a pre-
viously announced new science
building and new wing and remodel-
ing of the present science building.
Contractors will be invited to bid on
the projects separately or jointly,
President Cole said.

The new dormitory will complete
a three-unit student housing center.
Two other facilities, Newton D.
Baker Dormitory for upperclassmen
and John W. Davis Dormitory for
law students, were completed in 1959, |
along with the Letitia Pate Evans)
Dining Hall. The new dormitory will |

 

By Fall Of 1962

connect with Davis Hall, forming an
inverted U-shaped arrangement with
the other units.

Use of the new dormitory will en-
able Washington and Lee to elimi-
nate housing some freshmen in small,
auxiliary dormitories. Of the uni-
versity’s normal class of 320 fresh-
men, only 277 can be accommodated
in the regular freshman dormitory.
Others are housed in two university-
owned. residences, one of which will
be removed to make room for the
new, modern building.

The new. addition will also permit
greater flexibility in upperclass hous-
ing arrangements, President Cole
said,

Student: accommodations in the
new structure will include 39 single
rooms,.23 double rooms, and six
single rooms for student counselors.
The building actually will be divided
into two units, separated by a solid
firewall, with no direct passage be-
tween the two units.

Steve Danzansky, director of the
1961 SWMSFC Musical, announced
the cast for the coming production
last Sunday night at the play’s first
reading. In releasing the cast Dan-
zansky gave only the names of those
who had received parts, not the char-
acter they will portray.

Cal deColigny, Beta, and Andy
Leonard, Lambda Chi, received the
male leads. Deborah Doherty and
Nancy Duncan, both of Sweet Briar,
will portray the major female roles.

Both deColigny and Leonard have
had previous acting experience.
deColigny has appeared in the fol-
lowing Troubadour productions:
“Witness for the Prosecution” and
“Measure for Measure.” He has also
acted professionally in “The Com-

mon Glory” and “The Founders,”
outdoor plays given in Williamsburg,
Va. Leonard, also a Troubador, has
appeared in “The Lady’s Not for
Burning.” Nancy and Deborah have
also had previous acting experience.

Playing the supporting male leads
are Tom Andrew, John Towler, and
Firth Spiegel.

In all, a cast of 23 boys and 15
girls was named. Those boys getting
parts were Pete Alford, Pete Trager,
Arthur Portnoy, Stewart Yoffe, Ed
Croft, Richard Coplan, Brian Dorsk,
Harry Teter, Ronald Alenstein, Phil-
lip Booth, Herbert Salomon, John
Winebrenner, Bruce Whelihan, Wes

lain. Except for those girls playing
the female leads, names of support-
in actresses from Sweet Briar were

Danzansky went on to point out
that the number of actors and char-
acters will fluctuate from drop-outs
and recharacterizations for about the
first two weeks of rehearsal before
the cast is stabilized.

Including actors, approximately
125 people will be involved in the
play’s production. Helping Steve will
be assistant director, Ronald Alen-
stein; art director, Nancy Smail;
property director, Ed Ladd; female
and male vocal directors, Chris

musical’s fifteen piece orchestra.

Calm And Collected Generals Trounce

The Washington and Lee basketball
team upset the University of Virginia
Cavaliers by a score of 78-68 Mon-
day night in Doremus Gymnasium.
The Generals played their best game
of the season to pull off, in McHenry’s
words, “the greatest win here in a
long, long time.”

The Generals started fast, with Bip
Fauber scoring seven of their first
eight points. They took a 34-31 lead
into the locker rom at the half, and |
went ahead permanently 52-51 on |
Brett Thackston’s two free throws

UVa. Et Cetera

We beat “State”! The Cavaliers have fallen. To the ‘‘auto-

matic” and injury ridden Generals of the court we say thanks

and congratulations.

The Generals were an inspired team last Monday night.
They played without the services of two of the early season
starters. Ken Kowalski is out with a leg injury and Big John
McDowell fell under the automatic after the first semester.

How could those same Generals who have dropped a de-
cision to Hampden-Sydney since the semester break, knock off
the Cavaliers who, earlier in the season ran one of the leading
teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference into an overtime?
Guts and determination were the deciding factors. The Gen-

erals never let up. They never “

clutched.”

When the teams left the court at half time, W&L held
a three point advantage. Everybody knew it couldn’t last.
The Cavaliers seemed especially sure that the roof would cave
in after intermission. W&L men were offering “Virginia and

fifteen.” There were no takers.

After the half the Generals seemed cooler than ever. When
they fell behind by one point early in the second period, the
home crowd, at least where we were seated, seemed to feel that
“it was all over” and some of the group began to sigh over the

virtue of the “moral victory.”

But the expected break never

came. The score was tied and then the Generals pulled ahead for

good.

The moral to our story: you can’t corner the market on guts.

You can buy the talent and the

big names, but don’t count out

the boys who play for fun. There is not a scholarship man on
that basketball team. One of the injured players has been on
scholastic scholarship. The stipend was withdrawn when he
failed to make the required grade.

“The W&L System” will work.

Grayfred Gray, ‘Protest’ Author,
Wants ‘Violent Negative Reaction’

By ED WEBSTER

Grayfred Gray, the progenitor of
“Protest,” has seen a good bit of
life. He doesn’t like it.

For him, the basis of a good life,
and the heart of society, is the self-
fulfillment of the individual. Per-
sonal integrity, and a healthy ability
to cope with life, are the mainstays
of his code.

Protest, he feels, is an essential
way of action against the imperfec-
tions of modern American middle-
class emptiness.

Gray lives above the Lyric Theater
in a simple apartment, decorated
only with some painting by young
Richmond artists. With a wavy
shock of brown hair combed back,
and the promise of a beard sprouting
from his face, he confronts you with
frank gray eyes.

“Ym not a humanitarian,” he
says, “because most men stink.”
The trouble with man, Gray be-
lieves, is not that he is an ignoble
creature, but that he is failing to
realize his essential nobility.

Gray’s philosophy, although cen-
tered around protest, also has a
positive ethic. “I like to think of my-
self as an old-line American,” he
says. “You might call me an Ameri-
can Romantic.”

Because America is founded on
personal integrity and individuality,
Gray feels that this country can still
produce the kind of society that he
wants. “But self-fulfillment doesn’t
necessarily require democracy,” he
warns.

Among the men of history, Gray
most admires Jesus, “because he
lived by what he thought was right,”
and Nietzsche, because of his concep-
tion of the power of the individual.

In religion, Gray may be classed
as a skeptical Unitarian.

He’s not what we usually call a
beat. He has found that the exist-

 

ence is too empty for him.

Gray came to W&L in 1956, after
graduating from high school “just so
I could spite my old man.” His first
two years were taken in “trying des-
perately” to defend his Christian
ethic.

At the end of his sophomore year,
having learned of the San Francisco
renaissance from a Phi Beta Kappa
speaker, he headed West. There, he
hoped, he would be able to fulfill
his ambition to write. But three
weeks in Frisco taught him that the
city’s intellectual activity, if any, was
hidden beneath a carefree surface.

For the last month of that sum-
mer he rented a cabin at Goshen,
and wrote and thought until school
started.

After a junior year in which “facts
were piled on facts” with little real
knowledge being produced, Gray
drifted around the East for a while.
He settled in an apartment near
Richmond Professional Institute,
where art students and Virginia bo-
hemians congregate.

There he got a job as a clerk (“it
convinced me that I don’t want to
work again if I can avoid it”), saw
a psychiatrist, and published the first
three issues of “Protest.”

In March, 1960, having had
enough of Richmond, Gray con-
tracted a sudden marriage (since
broken up), and headed for Cal-
ifornia. He found himself working
again—but only because he needed
the money to return to W&L in
September.

Gray, now 22 years old and inde-
pendent, is a philosophy major with
honor-roll grades.

The purpose of his one-page mime-
ographed “Protest,” he says, is “to
shock people into awareness.” In his
first two issues, he attacked aspects
of contemporary concern that are
usually left alone by student pub-
lications. His sallies were vehement

O DK Day

 

The annual ODK tapping cere-
mony is Washington and Lee’s big-
gest surprise party.

Not one of the men tapped for
ODK membership in Doremus Gym-
nasium this morning knew before-
hand that he was going to receive
what is perhaps the highest honor
W&L can offer to a member of its
student body.

Selection of ODK members is a
long and involved process, designed
not only to enable faculty and stu-

dent committees to choose the best
men for the honor, but also to keep
those men finally chosen from finding
out before the actual ceremonies, ac-
cording to Professor R. N. Latture,
one of the original founders of ODK.

He said that several meetings
were held during the school year
for discussion of potential ODK
members.

Committees from the junior and
senior classes, the law school faculty
and the academic school faculty take

 

part in the discussions, during which
the merits of the individuals up for
membership are considered.

Membership is based on partici-
pation and leadership in five areas
of student life: student government;
publications; athletics; social and re-
ligious affairs; and speech, drama
and other arts.

Superior scholarship and character
are also necessary for membership
consideration.

 

 

Hoogenboom Solves The Parking Problem;

Hell Week Animostties Also Eliminated

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

Disregarding hell week for a mo-
ment, our most urgent problem at
Washington and Lee is_ parking.
There are too many cars, and other
than trying to fill that bottomless
pit behind the library, no one seems
to be doing anything about it. Prob-
ably because the ones who can do
something all have reserved parking
places and are therefore compla-
cent.

The people who have reserved
parking places are: eminent members
of the administration, faculty mem-
bers (anonymously), and employees
of the Slater gang. If you think
these are strange bedfollows, you
are damn right.

While things may look grim for
the present, the University is not
without foresight. Included in the
Ten Year Plan is a spacious parking
lot just on the other side of the
intra-mural field. However, until
the happy day when those plans are
realized, we must make do as well
as we can with temporary measures.

One simple way out would be to
eliminate student cars entirely. Then
the faculty and other dignitaries
(janitors, members of the Slater
gang) would have ample room to

| park and could have go-cart races
in the space left over. Those students
who defied the rules would have to
park their cars in the Mayflower
garage, like cadets, and then the
Mayflower would become all garage,
from top to bottom.

Another solution would be to sell
parking stickers for say 50 dollars
yearly. In this way, faculty mem-
bers would walk to school (exercise
is good for older folks, anyway), and
the resulting space would relieve the
parking problem. With the added rev-
enue that would be realized the
school could put Washington and
Lee seals like the one on the commons
on all the buildings on campus. Per-
haps they would even have enough
left over to put a neon cross on Lee
Chapel.

Unfortunately, each of these plans,
while undeniably attractive, has its
drawbacks. The chief drawback is
common to both: the failure to get
at the root of the problem, which is
student cars and their relationship
to grades and the University as a
whole. If all student cars were abol-
ished, most students would have no
way to come to school in the fall,
and the consequent diminution of

 

revenue would probably force the

closing of the school and its even-
tual sale to Southern Seminary.

On the other hand, there is no
doubt that cars affect grades, and
that students with difficult courses
should be forbidden to possess cars.
It is when we realize this that the
solution to all our problems be-
comes suddenly evident. A great
majority of the student body will
agree that freshman courses are the
easiest, and the upper-class courses
are hard. Therefore, only freshman
should be permitted to have cars.
Upper-classmen can get rides from
freshmen to and from school at vaca-
tion-time, to go to Hollins, ete., and
yet won’t have the actual tempta-
tion of possessing a car.

And incidentally, this plan would
go a long way toward alleviating the
problem we disregarded initially:
hell week. With the upper-classmen
dependent on the freshmen for rides,
they could not afford to be too harsh
or cruel.

Thus, in one simple proposal, we
haxe wrapped up four of the most
pressing problems facing this Univer-
sity in the next decade: hell week,
grades, cars and parking. This pro-
posal should be adopted without de-
lay.

 

 

Raven Rants

 

By G, L, OUELLETTE

A week ago the International Re-
lations Club played host to a rather
controversial figure. Norman Thomas
received an unreserved acclaim from
his audience. At first the reception
struck us as particularly strange, if
one recalls how this University has its
roots sunk in certain traditions.

Our first reaction was to shout
a loud “Hoorah.” Finally, we thought,
the true spirit of liberal enquiry, the
cold analysis of facts and situations,
has arrived.

The initial response the audience
gave Thomas suddenly came to dis-
turb this writer. For the next few
days after the lecture by the Ameri-
can socialist, we repeatedly heard
how “wonderful” the speech was,
how “exciting” a character .Mr
Thomas seemed to be. Wasn‘t it
“amazing” for someone in his mid-
seventies to speak with such adroit-
ness, for one to be such a “clear
thinker.” We cannot but feel that the

Norman Thomas the man, than of
Norman Thomas the socialistic think-
er.
Why the devil had so many gone
to Lee Chapel on such a stormy night:
to see a 76-year-old man, who, much
to his credit, poses exceedingly well;
or to hear an explication of the so-
cialistic approach to the East-West
conflict?

Whatever the answer, the fact that
we had to search far and wide among
the people who attended for any-
one to give us a pro or con on the
content of the lecture dismays us.
When we asked, we were given short
resumes of the theatrics which Mr.
Thomas exhibited, and we received
very little opinion concerning what
he had said.

* * *

We find the socialistic approach to
the East-West conflict alarming in one
respect at least. (We too were
charmed by the presence of the great
man, but we did give the address
enough attention to become provoked
on one of the basic points presented
by Norman Thomas.)

Thomas’ general outline for a new
set of principles, a new religion to
replace that of the worn and de-
ficient nationalism which the coun-
tries of the world have bowed to for
more than a century, brings out four
directions towards which the powers

 

involved must subdue their respec-
tive diplomacies.

audience became more aware of |

These four paths lead to disarm-
ament, arms control, international
military disentanglements with a
strengthened U.N., and last but not
least, the dedication of more sincere
efforts towards the reduction of the
poverty existing in the under-de-
veloped parts of the world. These
four ideals were very effectively de-
scribed as compatible with democra-
cy in the better sense of the word.
For this undigested statement,
Thomas was called by a local paper
of more than minor interest, “An
American of the best Tradition.”

International military disentangle-
ments and a renewed attack on pov-
erty appeal to us, and have always
been part of our ideology, regard-
less of what Thomas had to say about
them on Tuesday night. Disarmament
and arms control are quite another
thing. It seems that again an intel-
lectual turned prophet wishes to de-
stroy one of the basic nursery rimes
of this century: “Praise the Lord,
and Pass the Ammunition.”

This is no light matter. The knowl-
edge and science learned during the
course of the Two Great Lessons are
made to appear vulgar and inhuman.
The essence of knowledge is never
evil. The use of genius through hu-
man practice may not prove satis-
factory; however, for one to use the
clarion call in order to place any
knowledge aside for reasons of its
obvious potency certainly cannot rest
well with intellectuals. This is not the
stuff of which true religion consists.

We despise wars, as much, if pos-
sible, as Mr. Thomas himself does.
We cannot, however, see that world
conflicts will be avoided through the
negative ideology of mutual disarm-
ament. The forbidden fruit of truth
and knowledge has been partaken.
The effects have been felt twice dur-
ing the same century. How can we
possibly ask that we suddenly re-
linquish the power—even if today it
is lacking for the purpose of self-
preservation—that power which
twice re-established some sort of
world order in the pattern which we
saw as best?

Wars are not necessities, even if
history, page after page, emphasizes
their reoccurrence. Indeed we agree
that the religion of Nationalism has
been proven deficient; but surely it
would be naive to suppose that the
spirit which nationalsim embodies
can be replaced by policies of disarm-
ament and arms control alone. Poli-

 

Thomas Won Personal Victory,
But Were His Proposals Valid?

cies are poor substitutes for any-
thing as strong as religion.

We don’t pretend to know how
to solve the dilemma. We do, how-
ever, believe that the socialistic
emphasis is completely in error.
Ironically, the appeal which many
have seen as humanitarian, the call
for mutual disarmament and arms
control, has resulted in an acceler-
ated arms accumulation program.
Need we mention the East-West
missile race?

As we see the situation, we can
only suggest a new and untried order
of things. Presupposing that both the
East and West present themselves at
conferences, discussions, and meet-
ings on the identical platforms of
of nationalism, and all that it implies,
it would seem intelligent and advan-
tageous for the West to seek out new
tools of argument other than disarm-
ament and arms control, tools or ar-
guments that could bring possible

 

i agreement between East and West
| thus lessening the emotional import-
‘ance of nationalism. Then and only
then could disagreement not be in-
evitable.

Tap Ritual Noted For Suspense

To rate committee discussion a stu-
dent must have a grade-point ratio
appreciably higher than the aver-
age of his own graduating class.

“Each person brought up for con-
sideration is discussed several times
during the year,” said Dr. Latture.

“The final decision is never made
until the day before tapping takes
place,” he explained.

This, of course, means that it is
virtually impossible for a student to
find out if he has or has not been
chosen for ODK until the actual
tapping takes place.

* * *

Professor Latture told a Ring-tum
Phi reporter a story which should be
of interest to all members of the
student body, and especially interest-
ing to the freshman class.

According to Latture, one of the
first constructive accomplishments of
ODK after its founding 47 years ago
was the abolition of freshman haz-
ing in the university.

“Upperclassmen used to be able to
take freshmen out at any time and
beat fire out of them,” said Prof.
Latture.

He also said that one example of
the hazing which he remembers con-
cerns a group of freshmen who were
forced by paddle-wielding upper-
classmen to run down the streets
shouting, “I’m a fresh, fresh fresh-
man.”

However, after one particularly
serious injury was inflicted on a
member of the freshman class, Dr.
Henry Louis Smith, President of the
University, asked ODK to study the
situation and submit proposals for
dealing with the matter.

ODK asked for an assimilation
committee which would be respon-
sible for assimilating freshmen into
the traditions of the campus without
the “help” of other upper-classmen.

Today, 47 years later, the assimila-
tion committee is still basically the
same and has basically the same pur-
pose, It stands as an example of the
good which a conscientious organiza-
tion can do for a school.

Cagers Finally

Win On Road;
Beat Lynchburg

W&L cagers snapped their losing
streak on the road at 15, beating
Lynchburg College’s Hornets 68-65
Saturday night in Lynchburg. The
Generals, down 34-33 at the half,
stormed back after the intermission
to finally take the lead and hold
off repeated Lynchburg assaults.

Rodger Fauber, Brett Thackston,
and Steve Rutledge led the Gen-
erals in ending the losing streak.
Fauber and Thackston had 13
points apiece, while Rutledge add-
ed 12. In addition Fauber had 15
rebounds and Rutledge, for the
second game in a row, pulled down
12, both players consistently out-
jumping Lynchburg’s two big men
to clear the boards. Overall, the
Generals pulled down 53 rebounds
to Lynchburg’s 44.

Although the Hornets had four
men score in double figures, led by
Jeff Aultice with 17 points, their re-
maining two scorers had a total of
eight points between them. The Gen-
erals had a total of eight men in
the scoring column, none of whom
had less than four points. This
better-rounded attack helped the
Generals, who shot 35.7 per cent
from the floor, and added 18 points
in 26 attempts at the free throw line.

The Generals played the second
half without the services of start-
ing guard Ken “Killer” Kowalski,
who was put out of action midway
in the first period with an injury.

In a preliminary contest, the W&L
freshman team defeated the Lynch-
burg junior varsity 84-57, to bring
their season’s record to 9-3. Howard
Martin and Fred Ridolphi paced the
Brigadier attack with 21 and 19 points
respectively.

Capt. Sandy Mersereau grapples with opponent during Saturday’s N. C.

State meet.

WEL Grapplers
Take On W.Va.

The Washington and Lee matmen,
boasting a 7-1 record by virtue of
their 28-7 victory over North Caro-
lina State last Saturday, will meet
a subsidized West Virginia team
away tonight in what should prove to
be their toughest match of the season.
The Generals, however, will be with-
out the services of Herb Smith, the
165 lb. freshman, who broke his leg
in a skiing accident last weekend.

The Generals virtually annihi-
lated N. C. State via three pins, two
decisions, a draw, and a forfeit.
Hoke Robinson picked up five easy
points in the 123 lb. class as the
North Carolina team failed to pro-
vide him with an opponent. Dave
Montgomery then followed with a
pin, and Ken Greer fought Bill St.
Clair to a 1-1 draw.

Decisions by Ed Jenson and Herb
Smith and pins by Capt. Sandy Mer-
seraeu and Jud Babcock completed

W&L’s scoring at 28 points, the sec-
ond highest total of the year.

The West Virginia team, runner-
up to Virginia Tech in the Southern
Conference last year, has shown
considerable strength in the lower
weight and heavywegiht division
thus far this season. However, Coach
Miller feels that the Generals have
an outside chance of winning if they
can hold their own in the lower
weights and can pick up a couple of
pins in the middle weight classes.
Last year the Mountaineers stomped
W&L 27-3, with Mersereau scoring
the only General win.

McHenry Says

Team ‘Great’

I had the greatest shower of my
life on Monday night—fully clothed
and escorted by the great Little Gen-
erals after they had upset those
“Damn” Wahoos, 78-68. It looked
like the old saying that “a team that
won't be beat, can’t be beat” surely
came true. I have never seen a bunch
of boys put forth a greater team ef-

 

fort in my life. It was quite a vic-

tory.
Saturday we broke our 15-game
losing streak on the road with a not-

'| so-impressive 68-65 win. Few of the

faithful who followed us over figured

_| we could hold a candle to the Wa-!
_, hoos who have been playing the ACC
'| powerhouses. However, the boys be-

lieved in themselves and in our new
defense that we devised against the
larger and stronger team.

It was by far our greatest effort
of the season, and there were many
keys to the final outcome. Brett
Thackston, our tremendous ball
handler, high scorer, and quarter-
back, played his best game of the
year and got us 27 points. Bip Fau-
ber, our inspirational captain, and
Bill Ide, our most improved player,
both played their best games. All of
the boys played as if their lives de-
pended on the outcome.

See you at Catholic University
game on Friday. It is our last home
game this year.

W&L Sinks Georgetown;
Loses To AU; Record 4-3

By ED DICKSON

The Washington and Lee tank-
men returned from their Washington,
D.C. road trip this week with a
1-1 record to show for their endea-
vor. Their win came against George-
town University on Monday, while
the loss resulted from an encounter
with American University.

The Georgetown meet proved to
be fairly much of a run-away affair
as Coach Eastman and his team
coasted to a 64-31 victory. In Tues-
day’s meet with the Eagles from
American, the situation was slightly
different, and the Blue and White
suffered a 50-54 defeat.

In the Georgetown meet, Charlie
Stevenson started the Generals
off on the right track as he turned
in a winning time of 2:30.1 for the
220-yd. freestyle event.

The Generals captured a total of
five more first places in this meet,
with Jim Parker, Charlie Gummey,
Mike Harris, Elliott Maynard, ,and
Henry Gonsoulin receiving the cred-
its.

Sophomore Mike Harris was prais-
ed by Coach Eastman for his fine
performance as he placed first in

 

the 200-yd. backstroke with a win-
ning time of 2:40.7, while praise was
also in order for Parker’s first in the
50-yd. event and Gummey’s blue
ribbon points in the 100-yd. free-
style event.

In Tuesday’s encounter, an out-
standing performance by Elliott
Maynard marked the Generals’ in-
dividual display. He swam the win-
ning heat for the 440-yd. medley
relay team, placed first in the 200-yd.
butterfly event with a time of 2:37.7,
and finished off the afternoon by de-
feating the Eagle’s Bill Compton in
the 200-yd. breast stroke with a
winning time of 2:30.5.

Co-Captain Jim Parker captured
the only other first for the Generals
in this meet as he edeged out a
victory in the 50-yd. freestyle event
with a time of 24.2 seconds. Maury
Purnell placed third in this event.

At this point in the season, the
Generals now have a 4-3 record
with three meets remaining on their
schedule. Their next encounter is
with Wake Forest in Winston-Salem,
North Carolina on Friday, February
17, followed by a meet with East
Carolina College in Greenville, N. C.,
on Saturday.

“THE SLOW RUSH”

we think you'll think we deliver it
from our new unfiltered king-size Ph ilip Morris Commander,

 

Illustrated below is the membership pin of a brand-new national
fraternity called Signa Phi Nothing. To join Signa Phi Nothing
and get this hideous membership pin absolutely free, simply
take a pair of scissors and cut out the illustration and paste it
to your dickey
Let me hasten to state that I do not recommend your joining
Signa Phi Nothing. The only thing I recommend in this column
is Marlboro cigarettes, as any honest man would who likes a
filtered cigarette with an unfiltered taste, who yearns to settle
back and enjoy a full-flavored smoke, whose heart is quickened
by a choice of soft pack or flip-top box and who gets paid every
week for writing this column.
_It is difficult to think of any reason why you should join
Signa Phi Nothing. Some people, of course, are joiners by
nature; if you are one such I must tell you there are any number

of better organizations than Signa Phi Nothing for you to join—
the Mafia, for example.

But if you should join Signa Phi Nothing, let me give you
several warnings. First off, it is the only fraternity that admits
girls. Second, there is no pledge period; each new member im-
mediately goes active. Perhaps “inactive” is a more accurate
term; there are no meetings, no drives, no campaigns, no sports,
no games, no dues, no grip, and no house.

The only thing Signa Phi Nothing has that other fraternities
have is a fraternity hymn. In fact, two hymns were submitted

 

to a recent meeting of the national board of directors (none of
whom attended). The first hymn goes:

Hotcha, boop-boop-a-doop,
Mother’s making blubber seup.

The second hymn is considerably longer:
A Guernsey's a cow,
A road is a lane,
When you're eating chow,
Remember the mein!

— , ;

Pending the next meeting of the national board of directors,
which will never be held, members are authorized to sing either
hymn. Or, for that matter, Stardust.

Perhaps you are asking why there should be such a fraternity
as Signa Phi Nothing. I will give you an answer—an answer
with which you cannot possibly disagree: Signa Phi Nothing
Jills a well-needed gap.

Are you suffering from mental health? Is logie distorting
your thinking? Is ambition encroaching on your native sloth?

Are your long-cherished misapprehensions retreating before a

sea of facts? In short, has edueation caught up with you?

If so, congratulations. But tell the truth wouldn’t you like
to make an oceasional visit back to the good old days when vou
Were not so wise and composed and industrious—when you
were, In fact, nuttier than a fruiteake?

If you pine for those old familiar miasms, those dear, dead
vapors, Join Signa Phi Nothing and renew, for a fleeting
moment, your acquaintance with futility. We promise nothing,
and, by George, we deliver it! © 1961 Max SI

and highly subjective. Student re-
actions have been varied.

“I had sort of hoped for a nega-
tive reaction of a violent nature,”
commented Gray.

This spring, Gray and his few
associates hope to bring out a literary
magazine for student essays, poetry,
and fiction.

Gray is essentially a practical per-
son. When he needs money to re-
turn to school, he works, although he
dislikes work. When he needs high
grades to go to graduate school, he
studies the right books and gives
the right answers on quizzes, al-
though he may be chafing at his con-
finement. When he wants to stir up a
complacent student body, he delib-
erately attempts to insult the sen-
sibilities of the students.

After he finishes his schooling, he
hopes to be either a writer or a
teacher. “Those are about the only
two jobs where you can really keep
your freedom.”
