Re PRESET

The Brothers Four, all Phi Gams, will play for the Fancy Dress cocktail party given in honor of the dance president,

 

Don Partington, also a Phi Gam.

By ANDY NEA
News Editor

Don Partington, President of the
1961 Fancy Dress Ball, announced to-
day that the Brothers Four have been
signed to play at the Friday after-
noon cocktail party. Partington met
with the group during the past sum-
mer and began to negotiate for a
contract. Since that time, Don Rhine-
smith has completed the arrange-
ments necessary to bring them to
the Washington and Lee Campus.

The Cocktail party will be held

- on Friday afternoon from 3:30 until

6:30 at the Mayflower hotel. Arrange-
ments have been made so that the
quartet may be more easily heard
through the use of additional loud
speakers. However, it is requested
that people be as quiet jas possible
during the time that they are sing-
ing so that everyone may enjoy them.

Just a little over a year ago, Dick
Foley, Mike Kirkland, John Paine,
and Bob Flick, brothers in Phi
Gamma Delta, started singing to-
gether just for fun at the Univer-
sity of Washington in Seattle. Then
they began to sing in public. The
response to their refreshing, relaxed,
yet enthusiastic style was over-
whelming.

They hit the big time with their
first professional job at the “hungry
i” in San Francisco, where they
were spotted and signed by Mort
Lewis, manager of Dave Brubeck.
Within six months they had a Co-
lumbia contract and one of the big
record hits in the country—Green-
fields.

TV Debut

One month after they arrived in
New York they made their network
television debut on the Jimmy Rodg-
ers Show, and have since appeared
on the Ed Sullivan Show, the Kate
Smith Show, Mitch Miller’s Ford
Startime Spectacular, the Dick Clark
Show, “Be Our Guest,” and Cana-
da’s award-winning Music ’60 Show.
They have appeared at many col-
leges from coast to coast and re-
cently completed an engagement with
Johnny Mathis at the Carter Barron
Theater in Washington, D.C. They
have also won popular and critical
acclaim at the Newport Folk Festival.

Also signed to play during the
Dance Set are the Dukes of Dixie-
land. They will appear on Saturday,
Jan. 28, giving a concert that after-
noon.

The Dukes of Dixieland are one

 

of the top night club acts in the

Brothers Four To Appear At FD Cocktail Party

country. They have played repeat
performances at such places as the
Royal Nevada, The Thunderbird, and
the Dunes in Las Vegas and the
Famous Door in New Orleans.

The Dukes of Dixieland have re-
corded many albums of their dixie-
land jazz. Included in the albums
are such songs as Dixie South Ram-
part Street, and the Washington and
Lee Swing.

Dance Theme

The theme of this year’s Fancy
Dress Ball will be the Court of
King James. The gym will be dec-
orated like the famed Globe Theatre
in England. Dr. Fitzgerald Flour-
noy will announce the figure which
will be a procession of characters
from several of Shakespeare’s most
famous plays.

Costumes for the 1961 Fancy Dress
Ball will be on sale again after the
Christmas vacation. The costumes
are coming from the Hooker Howe
Company in Haverhill, Mass.,
the Oak Hall distributors in Roa-
noke.

The costumes will cost the normal
$18 per set for those couples who
do not have Dance Plans. However,
people with Dance Plans receive the
costumes for $16.

Gives Afternoon Talk

Dr. Mays Gives Meditation
In UCA Candlelight Service| |

By PETER ALFORD
Staff Reporter

The annual University Christmas
Candlelight Service was held Wed-
nesday evening at 10 p.m. in the
Robert E. Lee Episcopal Church.
Under the auspices of the Univer-
sity Christian Association the serv-
ice at the church included the Wash-
ington and Lee Glee Club and the
John Graham Brass Choir.

Dr. James Luther Mays, professor
of Biblical studies at Union Theolog-
ical Seminary in Richmond, was the
guest preacher who offered a Christ-
mas meditation.

Dr. David Sprunt, associate dean of
students and University Chaplain
gave the invocation and the bene-
diction at the service. A full congre-
gation heard the service.

Ashley Wiltshire, Arnold McKay,
and Phil McCaleb, all W&L sopho-
mores, read the appropriate pas-
sages of Scripture which were sup-
plemented by hymns sung by the
Glee Club and the Brass Choir.

The Glee Club, under the able di-
rection of Mr. Robert Stewart pre-
sented “Lo, A Rose Ere Blooming”
and “Silent Night.” The congrega-
tion joined in the singing of other
traditional hymns.

Contest Offers
Business School

Scholarships

“Initial response to our first annual
House of Edgeworth Scholarship Con-
test has shown how eager and ingen-
ious students are in applying their col-
lege training to the solution of prac-
tical business problems” reports J.
Carroll Taylor, vice-president of Larus
& Brother Company, Inc., sponsors
of the contest.

Campus publicity for the Scholar-
ship Awards already has encouraged
student response from many of the
nation’s colleges and universities, he
said.

Open to graduate and undergraduate
students of business, economics, ad-
vertising, marketing and commerce,
the contest offers two $500 cash award

 

scholarships. The first will go to the| -

undergraduate student submitting the
best advertising slogan with support-
ing brief for House of Edgeworth
smoking tobaccos. Winner of the sec-
ond award will be the graduate student
who writes the best marketing plan
to sell tobaccos to the college market.
Entries, to be postmarked no later than
midnight, March 15, 1961, will be
judged on the basis of originality, ex-
pression, and practical merchandising
value.

The annual contest is aimed at en-
couraging students in advertising
studies, while also offering an oppor-
tunity to apply classroom studies to
practical business problem,

 

The Glee Club joined the Brass
Choir for the final hymn, Kessler’s
“Alleluia.” The Brass Choir also
played the prelude and the postlude
for the service.

On Wednesday afternoon, Dr.
James Luther Mays conducted a
University Christian Association
sponsored discussion group in the
Student Union. At the beginning of
the conference, Dr. Mays gave an
informal talk on God’s relationship
to history, in which he stressed that
God acts in history and that God
reveals himself through historical
action. After his speech, Dr. Mays
led a discussion session with the stu-
dents.

Dr. Mays received his B.A. degree
from Erskine College in South Car-
olina, and his Ph.D. degree at the
University of Manchester in Eng-
land. Presently, Dr. Mays is Profes-
sor of Biblical Studies at the Union
Theological Seminary in Richmond,
Va., where he received his Bachelor
of Divinity degree.

Debate Team

In Tournament

Using different combinations for
the third time this fall, the debate
team traveled to Bridgewater last
week to take part in the Bridgewater
Invitational Tournament.

Washington and Lee used five
different teams in debating Bridge-
water and Randolph-Macon in three
rounds of action.

At the request of the host school,
no winners were declared.

The debated question was: “Re-
solved that the U.S. should enact a
program of compulsory health for
all its citizens.”

Debating the affirmative were Jim
Haley, Bob Cafferata, Charles C.
Flippen, and John Lackey. The neg-
ative teams were composed of Dick
McEnally, Dick Hoover, Lon Atkins
and Bob Street.

Co-Captains Otis Hess and Jay
Clark debated both sides of the
question, switching back and forth in
alternate rounds. Pete Straub, W&L’s
expert senior debater served as
judge.

Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

A Look At The Dance Program

There is much that is said, with which we can and do agree,

in the Tuesday edition headlined “Is Jazz Weekend Possible?”

Our present dance program seems archaic; the formal dance
is losing, if it hasn’t already lost, its appeal; from the policy of
the Dance Board it would appear that plan sales have dropped;
a change does seem in order.

We would personally welcome a jazz weekend in the spring.
This is not to say that the present program should be com-
pletely scrapped. We cannot visualize Dave Brubeck or Miles
Davis playing for a Fancy Dress ball. Lionel Hampton, who
has been here for two consecutive years with his band, has de-
veloped quite a following on campus. Nevertheless, the students
who have expressed an opinion in our presence have all agreed
that they are tired of the same bands every year. Everyone of
them has also said he would like to have a jazz weekend.

As for the combos in the fraternities being scheduled for
hours that do not conflict with the Saturday night dances, few
if any fraternity social chairmen will voluntarily agree to such
a move until something more in step with the times is offered in
the gymnasium.

The college student of today simply perfers to hear the
blues, the jazz (of sorts), and the noise of the combo rather
than the smooth sounds of the big bands. Along these lines, we
would welcome the appearance of such performers as Ray
Charles and his band, a group that seems to hit a happy medium
between Hampton and the Saturday night combo.

We do not necessarily defend the students’ taste for combos
but it is just that these are their tastes. And, after all, they are the
people who buy dance plans and support the dance board pro-
gram. It is time that the program be brought up to date.

We do not offer these objections as criticism of the present
dance board. It is manned by very capable people who are do-
ing what they feel is right. However, the fact that these people
are so very capable makes possible these suggestion in the hope
that they will re-examine their program to see if it is in or out of
step with the desires of the student body

—G. E. H. and R. R. G.

 

 

Less Criticism, More Support

We are happy to see that the basketball team came out on
the winning end of the game with Emory and Henry earlier
this week. We, however, have not been so pleased with the
criticism of the team for not winning more often.

Several factors must be considered. First, it is easy to criticize
anyone or anything that is down and out. This is especially true
in the world of sports. The Washington and Lee football team
certainly had their share of the knocks for five long years.

When the team began winning, indeed, went undefeated,
most of the critics lapsed into a sullen silence; few had anything
good to say for the team. The same will be true of the basketball
team. The days of the Floras, the Marshalls, and the Hoss’s in
basketball are gone from this school. These days should be
remembered with nostalgia, but they are not something with
which the present basketball team should be compared.

Secondly, the basketball team that Coach Bob McHenry
has floored is a young and inexperienced team. The starting
line-up is composed of a freshman, a junior, and three sopho-
mores. In college basketball these men are inexperienced and
should be recognized as such. That is not to say that they are
not trying. They are a scrappy team and a team that is capable
of playing an excellent game within their class.

This latter fact is the third one we must consider. This
University has taken a policy toward athletics that is honorable
and defendable. It is a course that has taken us from the high
ranks of college competition in athletic events and placed us on
a lower level. But just because we do not meet the greats of the
nation any longer is no reason to say that we can not offer excit-
ing, competitive games to the spectators. It is, after all, the com-
petition that makes the game, and we should realize that just
because we don’t win all the games doesn’t mean that the games
are not hotly contested.

Give your athletic teams your support and a chance—that

is all they ask.
—G. E. H.

 

Season’s Greetings

The entire staff of the Ring-tum Phi would like to take this
opportunity to wish the members of the faculty, the student
body and all our readers a very merry Christmas and a prosper-
ous New Year.

Since nearly all of us will be traveling to and from home
over the holiday, we would like to remind everyone of the haz-
ards of travel in the adverse weather conditions which we are
now experiencing. We hope no one’s vacation will be marred
by accident.

Last year during the Christmas holidays, a member of the
student body was killed in an automobile accident. It is our sin-
cere hope that Washington and Lee will not lose any of this
year’s student body during this vacation period. We would ask
that you remember this—Merry Christmas, Happy New Year,

and BE CAREFUL.
—R. R. G. and G. E. H.

 

 

 

Kennedy Names Excellent Men
To Head New State Department

Early this week President-elect
Kennedy announced the appointment
of his top-ranking State Depart-
ment officials. These appointments

.. were to have been
announced earlier
in November, but
Kennedy has tak-
en extra time to
make these im-
portant decisions.
The delay was
quite worthwhile.

The _ appoint-
ment of Dean
Rusk, Rockefeller
Foundation presi-
dent, as Secretary
of State; Rep. Chester Bowles of
Connecticut as Under-Secretary of
State; and of Adlai Stevenson as
Ambassador to the United Nations
should inject a new vigor, large in-
tellectual capacities and a_back-
ground of broad experience into U.S.

foreign policy under the new Ken-
nedy administration.

A native of Georgia, Dean Rusk
was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford and
later an instructor at Mills College.
Rusk was then on hand for World
War II as an Army deputy chief in
the Far East and as an official in the
War Department in Washington. Per-
haps less well known to the public
than his two new colleagues, Rusk
was evidently chosen for Secretary of
State because of his wide diplomatic
experience and his knowledge of
Far Eastern affairs.

First To Back Kennedy

Rep. Chester Bowles was one of
the first Democrats to back Presi-
dent-elect Kennedy for the Demo-
cratic presidential nomination this
summer and received national atten-
tion for his authorship and presen-
tation of the Democratic Platform in
Los Angeles. Rep. Bowles has served

 

Columnist Should Investigate,
Choose Subject, Then Write

By JAMES VANN
Friday Columnist

Any man who has made a regular
commitment to the Ring-tum Phi
to write a weekly
column is_ faced
with several prob-
lems—not the least
of which is sub-
ject matter. It is
my purpose in this
article to urge
these men to chose
very carefully
their subjects and
then do some pre-
liminary investi-
gation — both to
check the validity of their own par-
ticular points and even more import-
ant to analyse the implications that
their stand on the matters will have.

Haven’t Reached Success

No one here at Washington and
Lee, either in the faculty or student
governing positions, will maintain
that we have reached an optimum of
success in the University. But every-
one of these people is doing his very
best to see that we move there as
quickly as possible. It is necessary
for the student body to realize that
we all seek and each group is mov-
ing along the path that it feels of-
fers the most opportunity for the
moment.

Vann

In this choice of roads, to con-
tinue the analogy, there is certain-
ly question for debate in many in-
instances and sometimes the decis-
sions made can be totally in error.
But I would ask that the men who
want to criticize these various poli-
cies would do a little more than
sit down indignantly and write
about what is wrong in them.

For example, there has been a wave
of protests from some of the colmn-
ists lately about the policy of the
Executive Committee in placing the
transfer of the Dance tickets under
the honor system, and one columnist
was even graphic enough to begin
his article with this eye-catcher,
S-T-R-E-T-C-H. Now its certainly
not my purpose to drag up this issue
that has been beaten ad anuseam by
each paper for the past month; but
it can be used as an example.

It seems to me that the matter
has more implications than wheth-
er a man can transfer his plan, in
flagrant violation of the stipulation
made by the dance board that they
are non-transferable. It is hardly a
device used to aid the board in its
sales because the board can simply
have men stationed at the doors
to check cards and forbid the en-
try of anyone on another’s plan.
No. The whole issue of honor is at
stake. Is honor relative? Can it be
stretched?

Finally, there is another kind of
column that is even more dangerous
because it is more widely read and
that is the humorist column. All the
men who write these columns have
definite ideas on school policy and
as such are free to print them as
often as their editors permit. But
to these men I would only ask, sat-

 

  

irize when there is genuinely some-
thing wrong but don’t mock simply
because the subject lends itself to
wit and you can be amusing. For,
each of these columns is read and
acted on as much as it seems feas-
able by the people in authority. No
one of these people wants to force
policies that are unwanted by the
students. Therefore, columnists,
when you write and make points of
criticism, be sure that you have an-
alyzed the situation as thoroughly
as possible and then have come up
with an alternative that can be used
in place of the situation you are
criticizing.

as U.S. Ambassador to India and is
one of the most popular U‘S. officials
to work with the Indian government
and public. Like Dean Rusk, Rep.
Bowles is an authority on Far East-
ern affairs. Unlike Rusk, Bowles ad-
vocates a “two China” policy for
securing the representation of Red
China at the U.N.

More so than Rusk and Bowles,
Adlai Stevenson has been in the
public eye for many years, chiefly
as the articulate spokesman for the
liberal-wing of the Democratic party.
Stevenson is said to work well with
Rusk; both men have worked to-
gether in the U.N. and on the for-
mulation of a revised U.S—NATO
policy during the Truman adminis-
tration,

New Realism Indicated

In his formal acceptance of Presi-
dent-elect Kennedy’s appointment
this week Stevenson indicated a
trend towards a new realism in U.S.
foreign policy. With the admission
of many new nations to the U.N.
the United States can no longer hope
to control this body. “Our biggest
problem,” said Stevenson is to “iden-
tify ourselves with the emerging na-
tions.”

No longer shall we be content to
allow the new nations, especially the
African nations, to automatically
espouse the Soviet brand of Marx-
ism as a means to political and eco-
nomic independence without giving
these nations ample opportunity to
identify themselves with Western de-
mocracy.

A similar statement by Dean Rusk
points at a more vigorous leadership
on the part of the United States in
shaping world opinion. According to
Rusk, the U.S. has a “responsibility
to make history, and to take a large
part in shaping of events.” President-
elect Kennedy himself has already

What To Tell Friends?
“Dukes” Offer Subject

By THORNS CRAVEN
Friday Columnist

Since we’re all going home tomor-
row, and the hard-working among
us left yesterday, I spent most of last
week worrying
about what to
brag about during
vacation. The foot-
ball team ruined
Thanksgiving, and
the basketball
has already brok-
en the ice, and it
looked like I might
be humiliated
again. Then the
Tuesday Edition
came out, and I
was delivered from the clutches of
embarrassment. We’re having a real
live jazz weekend, with the real live
Dukes of Dixieland—and even be-
fore Springs.

Now being at this school for three
years I’ve learned quite a bit about
jazz, and I also know about all the
real live jazz spots from reading
the New Yorker. And I’m sure that
there are not any places in the world
more renowned for good jazz than
those that the real live Dukes of
Dixieland have just played in—The
Royal Nevada, The Thunderbird (as
you all know, the bird part is taken
from Charlie Parker’s nickname),
and The Dunes. Why everyone knows
that jazz was born in Las Vegas
(or was it the Ed Sullivan Show?)

 

Craven

Anyway, we can really brag
about how W&L is really big-
time with the real live Dukes of
Dixieland. And what makes it more
exciting is that they play OUR
OWN Washington and Lee Swing
(Lynwood [the Linotype operator]
put that in dark print like it was
in the Tuesday Edition, and maybe
our “own” should be captalized,
italicized, and underlined). And
for Freshmen who have never seen
a real live Fancy Dress (but who
I know have seen the real live
Dukes), here’s what it will be:

You'll get your too big pants and
your too little shirt for your genuine

made-in-Japan-by-real-live-coolies-
who-eat-costume, and take your
draped date to the ball. There you
will mingle with dozens (at least two
or three) of other couples who look
like they have the other half of your
regalia. You'll see a figure of amaz-
ing geometric precision, worked out
by the debutante daughters of the
math professors, and you'll swing and
sway with Sammy Dixieland. That
was a slip, this year it will be the real
live Dukes of Dixieland who are
from southern Italy, and good friends
with other great New Orleans musi-
cians like Count Basie (from Red
Bank, N. J.), and Billy Taylor
(Chicago), and Sidney Bichet (Paris,
France), and all those old time
goodies.

The rest of the Sem girls, along

Luthy Pays Visit
To Baldwin;
Has ‘Fun’ Date

By TOM LUTHY
Friday Columnist

After having seven previous col-
umns in this tabloid, I think that I’ve
finally hit upon a
subject which no
one really cares
about; the scenic
institution of bet-
ter women, Mary
Baldwin.

In my travels to
our numerous

neighboring girls’
, schools, I had un-
til last weekend,
by a_ stroke of
luck, passed over
Baldwin. For some strange reason,
(I guess it was that in the Commerce
School you’re only allowed two dates
a semester), I decided to make the
northern trip despite pleas from
more knowledgable souls than I. My
roommate would have gone too, but
it seems that he was a victim of a
rather idiotic local ordinance con-
cerning the throwing of snowballs,
and consequently was a little short
on cash.

Well, anyway, we made it to Staun-
ton about an hour late which is al-
ways good for building friendly re-
lationships with dates you’ve never
seen before.

My lodge brothers tried to sucker
me into asking for my date at the
State Institution for the Mentally
Unbalanced, but some nice lady
named Cleopatra said I was in the
wrong neighborhood.

Then I got my first glimpse of
Mary Baldwin, hanging on a hill
overlooking the town. It had “TILT”
written all over it.

This was just the beginning, for one
look at my date made me wish I was
back at Doc’s playing the pinball
machine.

It was at this precise moment that
I learned we were to attend a Christ-
mas dance in a near-by hotel. I
figured that if alcoholic beverages
were being served at the dance, my
date might become progressively
lovelier, but I took along a cool six
pack just to be safe. Now I know
why people who have never fought
a round in the ring become punch
drunk. That’s all that the eye could
see in the ballroom on each and every
refreshment table—PUNCH.

I still have the impression that the
chaperones and my date were slight-
ly honked off at me that evening.
Apparently it had never occurred to
them that anyone would deplete
the punch supply by drinking thirty-
four glasses of the stuff and then
throw the orange peels on the dance
floor!

Between punches I usually re-
treated to the men’s room to gulp
down a brew and to make sure that
the S.M.A. cadets, who were sneak-
ing drags on cigarettes in there,
hadn’t pilfered any of it.

My main problem was how to take
my date for the next four hours with-
out going completely berserk. After
fighting the Civil War several times,
deciding that it might snow soon, and
discussing the supply and demand
conditions of the soy bean industry,
I somehow survived until the mid-
night curfew rolled around.

I was thankful that the return trip
was a short one, although I slept
most of the way back and tried
to forget it. All I could say when
we reached my apartment was,
“Thanks a lot, ‘Mole,’ for taking me
with you. Remind me to ask that
honey down for next year’s Senior
Prom.”

Martin Scores 34 Points As Freshmen Slaughter _
Fishburne, 82-49; Staunton Tops Brigadiers, 67-39 |

Howard Martin came within six
points of the Doremus Gym scoring
record Tuesday as he poured in 34
points in leading the freshman
basketball team to a 82-49 victory
over Fishburne Military Academy.

The Gym record of 40 points was
set by Virginia’s Buzzy Wilkinson.

Martin, a 6-4, 195 pounder, com-
pletely dominated the first half as
he collected 24 points, including a
perfect eight for eight from the
free throw line, and pulled down
15 rebounds, 13 of which were of
the offensive variety.

For the first six minutes, the Brig-
adiers and Fishburne battled tooth

 

Generals Rap Emory & Henry, 62-50,
In Basketball (Or Football?) Contest

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Sports Editor
Fumbles, flying tackles, and body
blocks in December. Crazy? No. Just
basketball.
That is a description of W&L’s 62-
50 victory over Emory and Henry
Tuesday night at Doremus Gym.

 

Catholic Tops W@L, 65-48

Catholic University stopped a
second half W&L rally Thursday
night and captured a 65-48 basket-
ball win over the Generals at
Washington.

The Generals cut the Catholic
lead to 48-46 with five minutes left
in the game, but Catholic then
pulled away. Brett Thackston top-
ped the W&L scoring with 15
points.

 

The win, W&L’s second straight,
also was the Generals’ second
straight indoor football contest.

It seems that the General cagers
in addition to studying Bob Mc-
Henry’s basketball patterns have

and nail. Then Martin sank two
straight jump shots to put the Briga-
diers ahead, 14-9.

Martin and guard Stu Yoffe then
collaborated just before intermission
to widen the W&L lead to 47-27.

The Brigadiers coasted in the
second half with Martin, Yoffe, and

General Swimmers Still Winning, But Twombly
Has Relinquished Coaching Reins To Eastman

The change in command went al-
most unnoticed at Washington and Lee,
but for the first time in 29 years,
“Cy” Twombly isn’t coaching the
Generals’ swimming team.

The W&L swimmers, who since 1921
made Twombly the most successful of
all Generals coaches, are going right
on winning and just about everyone
assumed that Cy was still in charge.

His successor is Norris Eastman,
Twombly’s assistant for the past two
years, and like Twombly, a Massa-
chusetts native who came South from
Springfield College with a solid back-
ground in athletics in general and
swimming in particular.

Under Eastman’s hand, the Generals
have splashed to easy victories over
Roanoke College and the University of
Virginia so far this season but a beefed-
up schedule including meets with
Maryland and East Carolina, may make
duplication of last year’s unbeaten,
8-0, record difficult.

As for Twombly, no coach ever turn-

 

ed over his team to a successor with
greater confidence. “This young fellow
is interested in doing a good job and
he has a top-notch background,” says
Twombly of Eastman. “He was a big
help the past two years, the boys like
him, and if he stays around as long
as I have, he'll probably have a better
record.”

Twombly’s record is 150 wins against
50 losses. His swimmers won eight state
titles, four Southern Conference crowns
in a row from 1935 to 1938, and in
the mid-30’s, the Generals went five
years without losing a dual meet.
Twombly also had a 6-0 year in 1948-
49.

There’s a touch of irony in Twom-
bly’s retirement from swimming. “Even
when I had those teams back in the
30’s, I never had a good breast stroker.
Now all of a sudden I’ve had nothing
but good ones for six years and I’m
leaving Norris the best I’ve ever had.”

The Generals’ standout performer is
Elliott Maynard, a 22-year-old junior
from Portland, Me., who has broken

every W&L record for the breast-
stroke events and stands a good chance
of winning national honors this year
and next. He finished high in the
Eastern Intercollegiate meet last year
as a sophomore, and both Twombly
and Eastman agree he has not yet
reached his full potential.

The rest of the Generals are good,
solid performers, but none approach
Maynard’s level of performance.

“That’s been my secret recently, good
depth that has come from hard work
on the part of my boys,” says Twom-
bly. “My recent teams have had far
better balance than any of the good
ones back in 1930 when I depended on
a handful of real hotshots to win for

begun concentrating on Lee Mc-
Laughlin’s football formations.

But the Generals have not learned
their football lessons nearly so well
as their last two opponents, Sewanee
and Emory and Henry.

Emory and Henry not only had
a bag of football plays but also the
football players to execute them.
Six of their 11 players fell into the
6-4, 210-pound plus category.

Midway through the second half,
the roughness reached a peak when
an E&H player made a flying tackle
on W&L’s Bip Fauber. Even the ref-
eree got into the act at this point,
making a diving tackle of the E&H
player.

The Generals jumped off to a quick
3-0 lead, but Emory and Henry
charged back and grabbed its only
lead of the night.

The Wasps held their lead for
six minutes, then freshman center
John McDowell sank four points
to put the Generals ahead for
keeps.

Those four points were the only
points McDowell got all night, but

 

Fred Ridolphi handling the bulk of

the scoring.

Coach Joe Lyles cleared his bench
with six minutes left in the game,
but Fishburne managed to whittle
only five points off the W&L margin.

Martin added seven rebounds in
the second half to give him a total
of 22 for the game. The Brigadiers
outrebounded Fishburne, 58-25.

Yoffe and Ridolphi were the only
other W&L players in double figures.
Yoffe had 12 points and Ridolphi, 11. |

The Brigadiers’ record slipped to
2-3 Thursday when they bowed
to staunton Military Academy, 67-
39, at Staunton.

W&L grabbed an early 6-0 lead,
but Staunton stormed back and went
ahead, 19-8, at the end of the first
quarter. W&L never threatened af-
ter that.

Gordon Taylor paced the W&L
scoring with ten points.

With 12:00 left in the first half,

Malcolm Brownlee Offers Poem
On The Reality Of Christmas

By MALCOLM BROWNLEE

With all its candy, toys, and cheer.

The old, familiar carols play—
They’re old by that time anyway.

For Christmas was only a month

For spreading joy and happiness.

Clerks in shops are not themselves;

They now have change to Santa’s

With wondrous vision their watch
they keep.

To make goodwill and profits leap.

The nation pauses on its knees
To decorate short, plastic trees.
And while our noble friends are

Registration
Is Jan. 5, 6

Students are reminded of the
change in procedure of altering
courses for the second semester of
this school year.

All students should have obtained
their IBM sheets from the Registrar’s
office by today. The students are
urged to talk over the students’
changes with their parents over the
holidays. On January 5 and 6, in
conference with the faculty advisors
or major professors, the changes in
courses will be made. No changes,
except for failures will be made af-
ter the second semester begins.

This change was made by the ad-

To cover a spot where the paint is

There are some (they’re not few)
who critically say,

That the true meaning of Christmas
reigns for only one day,

Then with trimmings and wrappings

That the carols we’ve heard for a
full month before

Are silenced, and we hear them no
more.

But be patient, my friends, and do
not despair,

For things are right now in a state

As Santa departs in his deerpowered

The Original Drifters will perform
at a party to be given by five Wash-
ington and Lee fraternities the Sat-
urday night of Fancy Dress week-
end, it was announced today.

Roy Goodwin, social chairman of
the KA House, said that the KA,
SAE, Phi Delt, Beta and Sigma Chi
houses will combine for a party to
be held January 28 from 9 p.m. until
1 a.m. at the Mayflower.

Accompanying the Drifters, he
said, will be the Louis Candy Or-
chestra, from New York City.

Goodwin, who is handling the ar-
rangements for the party, said that
the Drifters and the Louis Candy
Orchestra were both booked from
New York through the Universal
Artists Corporation.

The party will be open to only
the members of those houses.

Tickets have been printed to dis-
tribute to members of the houses,
and will be given out in the near
future by each houses’ social chair-
man.

John Lee, Phi Delt social chair-
man, was in charge of getting the

To Sponsor Boys Cub

The University Christian Associa-
tion will sponsor the Boys’ Club
again this year as one of its six
activities.

The Boys’ Club provides after
school recreation for both white
and colored boys of grammar school
age. The boys are taught the fun-
damentals of major sports in addi-
tion to gaining experience from
group activities.

Malcolm Brownlee, President of
U.C.A., stated that supervised re-
creation is held on Monday and
Wednesday afternoons at the colored
school and on Tuesday and Thurs-
day afternoons at the white school
by the U.C.A. According to Brown-
lee, the boys will be divided into
teams for tournaments in the various
sports.

Later this year the Boy’s Club
will begin swimming classes at the
University pool on Tuesday nights
and plans are being made for sev-
eral hikes near Lexington.

me.”

Among those who are continuing
to give Eastman depth and experience
are freestylers Charlie Hart and
Charlie Gummey in the dashes, and
Herb Jahncke, a distance freestyler
whose father once swam for Twombly.
All are sophomores who won their let-
ters last season as freshmen. Co-Cap-
tains Jim Parker and Maury Purnell
are senior veterans.

Eastman, a 27-year-old native of
New Bedford, Mass., is optimistic about
swimming’s future at W&L. As good
as Twombly’s record is, Eastman
thinks he can do better, and that’s
the kind of attitude which convinced
Twombly that Eastman was the right
man to become the third man ever to
coach the sport at W&L.

Kennedy Has
Excellent Staff

(Continued from page 2)

demanded a foreign policy of leader-
ship, not reaction, in his hope that
“the foreign policy of the United
States will be identified in the minds
of the peoples of the world as a
policy that is not merely anti-Com-
munist, but is for freedom...”

Degree of Control Unknown

At present, the degree to which
Kennedy himself will control the
State Department is not known. It
is known, however, that President-
elect Kennedy is an advocate of vig-
orous executive action, and the fact
that a major criterion in his selection
of foreign policy makers has been
personal compatibility with the new
President makes it rather certain that
Kennedy himself will play a rather
important role in actual foreign-
policy formulation.

All indications are that the pres-
ence of Dean Rusk, Adlai Stevenson,
and Chester Bowles in top State De-
partment positions will result in a
new era of United States diplomacy.

These men will not lack an oppor-
tunity to prove themselves; the Sov-
iet Union’s tested formula of vig-
orous, opportunistic foreign policy
should provide this new State De-
partment with the opportunity to
respond successfully to not a few
Soviet challenges.
