Application Rate|

Seen Increasing

The steady climb in applications for
admission to Washington and Lee’s
Freshman class is increasing again
this year, Dean F. G. Gilliam said to-
day.

As of December 1, the rate of in-
crease in the number of applications
was 27 per cent higher than 1959, and
59 per cent higher than 1958.

“This year’s increase is smaller than
the increase between 1958 and 1959,”
Dean Gilliam said, “but we expect the
difference in rates of increase to change
before the close of the first term.”

The continued rise in applications
for admission and the limited Fresh-
man housing facilities has caused
Washington and Lee to become more
and more selective each year.

Dean Gilliam pointed out that the
rise in academic standard of the stu-
dents accepted by the University is
seen through the average College Board
scores of the class of 1964, which were
the highest scores of any class in the
history of the University.

Even though the Univerity has al-
ready received many applications, lit-
tle action will be taken before the end
of the first term, he added.

The great majority of decisions are
made by March 1. At that time, those
candidates are informed whose cre-
dentials clearly entitle them to ac-
ceptance. Likewise, candidates whose
credentials show no reasonable pos-
sibility of acceptance also are in-
formed.

All candidates will definitely be in-
formed not later than April 15, he said.

Phi Kaps Win
IFC Song fest

Phi Kappa Sigma won the annual
IFC Songfest and the rotating plaque,
edging out three other fraternity
groups.

The winning entry won the title
with its rendition of “Ride the Chariot”
and “My Lord, What a Morning.” The
Sigma Chi songsters, in second place,
sang “Angelico” and “Away RiRo.”
The group representing Sigma Nu
sang “Angry” and “Slide Trombone,”
and the Sigma Phi Epsilon entry sang
a medley of Christmas carols and
the spiritual, “It’s Me O’ Lord.”

The members of the winning Phi
Kappa Sigma Group are George
Chapman, Jim Mell, Chris Larson, Sam
Channel, Tom Edwards, Chuck Shu-

 

mate, Mac McKay, Dave Spencer,
Ralph Weizandt, Jim Surface, and
Bill Tedards.

The songfest, held in Lee Chapel,
attracted over 150 people. Dr. Borden,
Mr. Stephenson, and Mr. Stewart
served as the judges for the event.

The Sigma Chi group consisted of
Bob Aylin, Robin Dawson, Mark Gee,
Henry Harrell, Billy Martin, Hardie
Karrh, Al Hay, John Refo, John Mon-
tague, and Pete Stelling.

The Sigma Nu Singers were Bud
Lee, Glenn Fidler, Dave Peters, Dick
Reed, Frank D’Lauro, John Dunnell,
John Harcourt, Fred Nelson, “Top”
Logan, and Dave Streetman.

In the SPE group were Woody
Wise, John Tipton, George Peters,
Steve Colvin, Jere Cravens, Bob Grif-
fin, Dick Eaeger, and Palmer Parding-
ton.

 

Language Song Fest Held
The 13th annual Foreign Language

Christmas Songfest was held this af- |

ternoon in duPont Auditorium. The
sing this year included only the French
and German departments. The Spanish
and Russian students did not partici-
pate.

Dr. W. W. Pusey, who has been
master of ceremonies in the past, was
not able to serve this year and was
succeeded by Dr. G. F. Drake.

The program included a mixture of
French and German carols and folk
songs.

William B. Lowry read the Christ-
mas Story in German and John Baker
sang a solo, the German Christmas
carol, “Alle Jahre wieder.”

The participants were treated to a
Coke during a short intermission.

VMI Professor Speaks On Nineteenth
Century Military Security In The U.S.

Major Tyson Wilson, a professor of
history at VMI and a Lt. Col. in the
Marine Corps Reserve, delivered a
lecture on “Challenges to the National
Security Establishment in the Nine-
teenth Century” to the freshmen mem-
bers of the W&L ROTC Department in
Lee Chapel last night.

Using “to provide for the nation-
al security” as an opening thought,
Major Wilson stressed the analysis
of the national security setup by civil
leaders, principally John C. Calhoun,
from 1803 to 1853. He discussed Cal-

 

houn’s “expandable army;” consist-
ing mainly of officers, and how that
concept agreed with the prevailing
civilian attitude of “no large stand-
ing army in peace time.” He also
pointed out the cooperation be-
tween the army and navy in this
period, and how they helped
strengthen each other.

A close relationship between the state
and federal governments was shown
to exist through the constant use of
state militia with the regular troops
in securing the western frontier in the

 

‘Classrooms Abroad’ To Provide
Summer Study Plan For Students

Eight groups, each containing 20 to
30 American college students, will pay
a seven-week visit to a European city
next summer to study the language,
culture, and civilization of one country
during their stay. Designed for serious
students who do not plan to see all of
Europe in a short summer, Classrooms
Abroad tries to teach a seminar in
area studies through a summer of ac-
tual living in one of the following
cities: Berlin or Tubingen in Germany,
Vienna in Austria, Bensancon, Gren-
oble or Pau in France, Madrid or
Santander in Spain.

Graded classes in small sections of
six to ten students each under the
supervision of American and native
professors will deal with the reading of
classical and modern texts, the daily
press, contemporary problems, con-
versation, pronunciation and grammar.
Students will also hear lectures on his-
tory and literature and meet with
outstanding personalities. They will

you don’t know a word of German,
French or Spanish to learn more than
a year’s worth of college German
French or Spanish in the course of a
summer,” says Dr. Hirschback, di-
rector of Classrooms Abroad, “provid-
ed that we get serious and mature
students who are willing to mix busi-
ness with pleasure.” Dr. Hirschbach
who will lead one of the German-
language groups, is an assistant pro-
fessor at the University of Minnesota.
Other group directors include profes-
sors from Yale, Denison University,
Haverford College, Queens College,
the University of Georgia, Cornell,
and the University of Massachusetts.
Classrooms Abroad has grown from
eleven students in 1956 to an expected
two hundred participants in 1961.

various Indian wars and the Mexican
War. The cooperation between the
military and civilian industries, chiefly
in the fields of communication and
transportation, was also pointed out.

The use of the military for diplo-
matic purposes was discussed. The
prime example of the military’s diplo-
matic use was the unauthorized in-
vasion of Florida by Andrew Jackson
in 1817. Although Jackson’s actions in
Florida brought diplomatic protests
from abroad, the end result was the
cession of Florida by Spain to the
United States. The Monroe Doctrine
was cited by Major Wilson as the
diplomatic cornerstone for defense of
the Western Hemisphere from foreign
aggression.

In addition to the previously men-
tioned main points Major Wilson
talked for a short while about the
Mexican War. The Major did not
discuss the actual war, but rather
the preliminary moves of the army in
California and on the Mexxican
border to get into position to attack
when the war broke out.

With reference to the growth of
military schools, Major Wilson made
the following statement: “The various
military schools, principally West
Point, Norwich, and VMI, were de-
veloped to train career officers for
the army.” Major Wilson went on to
say that engineering constituted most
of a cadet’s curriculum in those days.

Also, the foreign influence on Amer-
ican military life in the nineteenth
century was discussed. It was shown
that the French methods of using
artillery and infantry and the French
construction of coastal defenses was
the main outside influence.

Present Concert

During Second Day Of Dance Set

By Richard Cruse
Jimmy Vann, President of the Dance Board announced that
the Dukes of Dixieland will appear here Fancy Dress weekend
on Saturday, Jan. 28, giving a concert that afternoon. The
Dukes are world famous for their modern interpretation of clas-
sic dixieland music. Vann stated that, ‘The Dance Board has

Student Films

To Be Presented
Second Semester

Original documentary and experi-
mental motion pictures produced at
Washington and Lee will be shown
February 6 in the second annual Lex-
ington Film Review. The films will be
shown at 7:30 p.m. in Payne Hall 6,
the journalism lecture room.

Most of the films to be shown were
produced last spring by students in
the second semester course in the mo-
tion picture medium offered by the
University’s Department of Journal-
ism and Communications. Students
wrote their own scripts, photographed
the films with the department’s equip-
ment, and made their own sound
tracks.

The longest film is a documentary
on the life work of Marion Junkin,
professor of art at Washington and
Lee. Photographed by E. H. Ould,
Jr., 60, and O. W. Riegel, instructor
in the course, the film includes an
explanation of true fresco paintings.

Also to be shown are “The Inaugu-
ration of President Fred C. Cole,” a
documentary record film by Robin
Frames, ’60, and “Recollections on a
Bicycle,” an associational experiment
by Fred H. Belden, Jr., a member of
last year’s class who is now a student
of architecture at Columbia Univer-
sity.

By request, an experimental film
produced the year before will be
screened again. This is “Gray Rain,” a
subjective film with a Lexington set-
ting produced by Barton de Palma, of
the class of 1960.

As a collateral assignment in the
course, students are given the option
of writing either an original research
paper on some historical, aesthetic,
economic, or social aspect of the mo-
tion picture medium, or producing
a documentary or experimental film.

Students last year produced, in addi-
tion to the films mentioned, documen-
taries on motion picture production,
rug making, and the biography of a
news story, a narrative film on crime
and police methods.

 

Light, Fishwick, Ragan
Selected As Vestrymen
For R. E. Lee Church

The Robert E. Lee Episcopal Church
has announced the selection of three
new vestrymen from the Washington
and Lee faculty and administration.
The new vestrymen are: Dean Charles

i | Light, Dr. Marshall Fishwick, and Dr.

Allan Ragan.

Dean Charles Light, dean of the
School of Law, joined the Washington
and Lee faculty in 1926. Dean Light
was a colonel in the Judge Advocate
General Corps of the United States
Army. He is presently a member of
the District of Columbia Bar Associa-
tion, and Omicron Delta Kappa.

Dr. Marshall Fishwick, a professor
of American studies, came to Wash-
ington and Lee in 1949. Dr. Fishwick
has studied in Europe on a Fulbright
grant. Dr. Fishwick was a_ visiting
professor in Denmark last year. He
has written eight books, and is a
member of Omicron Delta Kappa
and Phi Beta Kappa.

Dr. Allen Ragan, associate profes-
sor of political science, joined the
Washington and Lee faculty in 1946.

'| He is a member of the American Po-

litical Science Association and the au-

| thor of several books.

As vestrymen, Dean Light, Dr. Fish-
wick, and Dr. Ragan will help promote
the total church program in the dio-
cese, and administer the affairs of the
local parish.

 

*®weekend an all around success. It has

been a great pleasure for us to work
with such a conscientious president as
Don Pardington, and it is our hope that
the student body will give the weekend
the support and enthusiasm it de-
serves.”

The Dukes are actually a family af-
fair. Brothers Frank and Freddie As-
sunto founded the group ten years
ago in New Orleans, They were later
joined by their father, Jack Assunto,
and Betty Owens who is Mrs. Fred
Assunto in private life.

The Dukes of Dixieland are one
of the top night club acts in the
country. They have played repeat
performances at such places as the
Royal Nevada, The Thunderbird, and
The Dunes in Las Vegas and the
Famous Door in New Orleans.

The Dukes got their big start after
taking top honors on a Horace Heidt
Amateur Show in New Orleans. After
two weeks of touring with the Heidt
band they returned to New Orleans
and went professional. They played a
record forty-five weeks at The Fa-
mous Door, gaining national recogni-
tion which led to engagements
throughout the country.

The Dukes of Dixieland have a style
stemming basically from that of the
Original Dixieland Band, which enjoy-
ed it peak popularity during the early
part of this century.

Actually the Dukes are a perfect il-
lustration of a kind of feed-back in
jazz whereby contemporary musicians
perform in the humble traditions of
Negro song and dance bands on the
street corners years ago. But where
other jazz combos attempt to sound
like these song and dance bands of
yesteryear—slow, easy-going, the
Dukes have a more virile style that
imparts considerably more character
to whatever they play. Their interpre-
tations of songs going back as far as
the gay nineties has a kind of modern
dynamic quality which places them
apart from any other contemporary
combo.

Using special arrangements that
are planned in detail before a single
note is played, the Dukes achieve
overall maximum freedom of design.
At the same time, instrumental ideas
and harmonies are worked out with
a view towards getting a closely-knit
texture.

The Dukes learned much of their
style by absorbing what they could
from many of the musical “greats”
who played in New Orleans; Louis
Armstrong, Count Basie, Sidney
Bechet, Dave Brubeck, Bunk Johnson,
Billy Taylor, and Jelly Roll Morton
are included in this list.

From the very beginning the Dukes
have been meticulous, even arbitrary,
about technical and stylistic perfection.
By combining musicianship and versa-
tility, they manage to achieve first class
virtuosity, while giving the impression
that their playing has the casualness of
a free-for-all or jam session.

The Dukes of Dixieland have re-
corded many albums of their dixieland
jazz. Included in the albums are such
songs as Dixie, South Rampart Street
Parade, and our own Washington and
Lee Swing.

 

Annual Candlelight Service

Dr. James L. Mays, associate pro-
fessor of Biblical studies at Union
Theological Seminary in Richmond,
will speak here tomorrow night at
10 o'clock at the University Candle-
light Service, at the R. E. Lee Mem-
orial Episcopal Church.

Dr. Mays was born in Louisville,

Is Jazz Weekend Possible?

The lagging sale of dance plans has caused some concern
to a number of organizations on campus. At present, the Dance
Board seems to be the most perturbed of these groups. The
question of how to promote the sale of the plans has arisen. Let

us offer our suggestions.

The obvious solution to the problem is to make the dance
sets more appealing to the student body and to eliminate the
competition of fraternity combos during dance hours. Cooper-
ation would be required to achieve both these goals. First, the
dance board would have to offer more attractive entertainment

to the student body.

Our present dance set program is archaic. As much as we
hate to admit it, the formal dance is losing its appeal. This fact
must be accepted. We must admit that this is the age of jazz
and “rhythm and blues.”’ This is the age of the concert and
the combo. The formal dance band is on the way down.

We do not advocate the abolition of the formal dance sets.
What we do advocate is that the informal dance which is usually
held on the Saturday night of the present dance set schedule
be done away with and that a concert be substituted in its place. |

We also: would like to suggest that the spring dance set be | F

converted into a jazz weekend.

-We realize that any such change would involve complica- |
tions. The plan would have to be accepted by the Dance Board,
the student body, and, last but not least, the administration.

If the fraternities would agree to hold off on their combos
until after the concert on Saturday night, the attendance
problem would be nonexistent.
and able to offer the right kind of entertainment this phase of
the proposed plan might be worked.out through the IFC. We
see no reason why the fraternities should object.

Whether or not the student body would prefer the jazz
weekend to the old form of spring dances is a matter of opinion.
We believe that the proposal would be accepted with enthusi-
asm, and that such a change would stimulate interest in the
entire dance program at Washington and Lee.

Such a change would certainly increase the sale of the
dance plans and might even aid in solving the problem which
has arisen over the transfer of these plans. If more people buy
the plans, there will be less reason for transfer.

If the Dance Board is willing

Webster Discusses Dance Plans;
No-Transfer Statement Is Only
Technical Gimmick To Up Sales

By ED WEBSTER

The campus is busily engaged in
finding the answer to a question which
is basically meaningless: Whether you
are being dishonorable when you lend
another person your dance plan.

This question is unanswerable be-
cause it weighs relative ‘action in terms
of an absolute standard.

‘The Honor System, in its true and
traditional form, applies only to ac-
tions which our society regards as ab-
solutely wrong. There is no half-way
point between cheating and non-
cheating, lying and telling the truth,
or stealing and non-stealing.

On the other hand, according to
an accepted custom in ‘our country,
season tickets to concérts and sports
events are transferable. If the best
social conventions say that the trans-
fer of a ticket is far from dishonor-
able, why should it be a violation of
the W&L Honor System? If I can,
in good conscience, lend someone
my season ticket to the W&L Con-
cert Series or the Troubadours, why
can’t I also lend him my dance plan?

Thus the transfer of a dance plan
involves neither lying, nor cheating,
nor stealing. No lie is told, for no
statement is made. No one is cheated
and nothing is stolen, because the
Dance Board (the only party with
anything worth taking) has the same
amount of money as before.

The Dance Board acts as a broker,

 

collecting money from the students and
spending virtually all of it on the danc-
es. If the transfers cause door receipts
to lag, the Dance Board won’t lose any-
thing; it will merely have to cut its
budget on the ‘next dance.

It is clear, however, that the trans-
fer of dance plans puts more than
800 students at a disadvantage. These
are the owners of dance plans, who
expect top-flight entertainment.

A considerable part of the Dance
Board budget—the part that lets us
hear Louis Armstrong instead of Lefty
Flatnote—comes from door receipts.
If the dance plans can be transferred
easily, and door receipts fall, the cal-
ibre of entertainment at future dance
sets will be lower.

That, in a nutshell, is the only basic
reason for not transferring dance plans.

* + *

Lest I be accused of being amoral, let
me emphasize that I believe firmly in
the spirit as well as the letter of the
Honor System. What I object to is the
use of a technical gimmick to bring
dance plans under the system.

Here’s the gimmick. On each dance
plan the Dance Board has printed
a statement, which the purchaser is
supposed to sign. It reads like this:

“T understand that admission to all
the dance sets is personal and non-
transferable.”

I_HAD NO IDEA
THAT PUNTING COULD BE
SO SOUL-SATISFYING!

    
 

By HUGO HOOGENBOOM

Now that winter’s here and snow
covers the ground there will be no}
place for exhuberant young college lads
to work off their excess spirits. With
the prospect of seeing a whole campus
full of pasty-faced indoor lounge liz-
ards before me, I think it timely to
offer a few suggestions in the way of
healthy indoor activities calculated to
maintain that rosy bloom and trim off
those excess pounds. And this does
not-mean drinking until the capillaries
tin the face are permanently dilated.

No, the crying need is for some
athletic diversion which doesn’t re-
quire the elaborate preparation of
swimming, squash or basketball.
Something, that is to say, that can be
done in the home. The answer is
hallball. All that this grand game
requires is a few sturdy youths, a
football and a hall, preferably long

 

and narrow, like those on the upper
floors of fraternity houses. The rules
are essentially those of football, ex-
cept that the size of the hall deter-
mines the number of players.

After the kick-off, which is carried
out in the same manner as in foot-
ball, the ball is put into play where
it was returned and that side has
four downs to score. Punting is ac-
complished by the pass, since the low
ceilings of the average fraternity hall-
way would hinder a really good, high
spiralling punt. One of the chief varia-
tions from the ordinary game is that
the play ends when the runner is
completely down on the ground.
Things like forward progress and such
have no place in the game. As a matter
of fact, it is considered a great de-
fensive achievement to carry the run-
ner all the way back to the end of the
hall for a touchback while he struggles

 

to throw himself on the ground. Need-
less to say, the game is a little rough,
and it’s always wise to take a few
drinks of some commercially available
stimulant, to numb the pain.

A variation of hallball has been
suggested, although not actually test-
played. For those of you who are pre-
pared to do a little experimenting, here
is a rough idea of the game of stair-
ball.

This game can be played in any
three-story house, or any two-story
house with a basement. It’s elements
are essentially those of hallball, ex-
cept that the upper and lower stories
are the goals. Each landing is a first
down, and the offensive team must
always run uphill. If a team should
give up the ball on downs, it will
have to be treated as the change of
sides after the quarter. As I said,
this game has not been tried out in

the field, but we would appreciate
reports from any who have tried it.

For those who like a sport with the
zest of danger and the excitement of
crowds of spectators, there is aways
bull fighting with a lawn mower in
the basement.

These games should be enough to
carry you through the winter. They
should be more than enough to carry
the Lexington hospital through the
winter and a good part of the spring,
too. A committee on indoor sports has
been formed and may be contacted in
care of this paper should any difficul-
ties about rules come up.

NOTE: This newspaper hereby ex-
pressly disavows itself of any responsi-
bility for any injuries that may result
from anyone’s attempting to play any
game described above, and warns that
anyone foolhardy enough to play them
does so at his (or her) own risk.

As we arose Sunday morning and
saw the falling snow we attempted to
turn our thoughts toward new things.
For years snow has held this effect
on us: the desire to enter into un-
explored spheres of thought. The sight
of the first snow has, in the past,
transported our mind onto new heights
and called us to survey new realms.

This extraordinary spirit was un-
doubtedly provoked by the covering,
fresh, clean, and white, that the weary
autumn nature dons. Nature appears

to bury its old self, and in the process
it beckons to the yet unborn to mater-
ialize. Because, we suppose, we con-
sider ourself part of nature, we have
felt the urge, the necessity, to shake off
old anchors, to close the unfinished
book, to enter into fields unmarred and
uninitiated.

This year the feeling became rather
difficult to achieve. Perhaps we had
not prepared our mind sufficiently for
the task: perhaps we were in a some-
what heavier state of apathy than we
usually find ourself at this time of

 

Opportunity For

By GEORGE BIRDSONG

One of the most interesting ideas
President elect Kennedy has mentioned
is that of creating a “Youth Corps”
composed of all interested and quali-
fied American students. Kennedy plans
to push this idea in Congress next
year. The plan is to sign up thousands
of young men for 3 years, and to
send them abroad to underdeveloped
nations as teachers, technicians, farm
experts, engineers, and in any other
capacity necessary. This program will
provide a real challenge for those stu-
dents who would prefer to perform
their duty to the country in a creative
service rather than in military service.
This program will not, however, be a
haven for draft dodgers. Pay will be
about the same as the military, living
conditions probably below military
standards, and time longer than some
branches of the military service re-
quire.

“The Youth Corps,” if passed by
Congress, will probably not get roll-
ing until late in 1961. However, there
are still many opportunities at the
present time for students who would
like to participate in a foreign ex-
change program. There are numer-
ous programs run by church and

group now has some form of foreign
exchange program each summer. In-
formation concerning these “work
projects” can be obtained from
almost any church pastor or minis-
ter to students. With most of these
programs come financial assistance
to the student.

Information about school sponsored
programs can be obtained from many
foreign language professors. In addi-
tion, the W&I. Commerce Fraternity
is sponsoring a program through the
International Association of Students
in Economics and Commercial Sci-
ences. The faculty advisers for this
group are Dr. John Gunn and Dr. Le-
land McCloud. The purpose of
AIESEC is to further international
understanding and education — es-
pecially among future leaders of the
world and business community. Un-
der this program a student will work
from six weeks to three months in a
European business. In general, the
salaries will allow students to break
even during the period they are em-
ployed, and transportation will be
provided at reduced rates.

It should not be necessary to list the
numerous opportunities available for
American students. The point that must

the school year. Or maybe the snow
had come earlier than usual.

Nevertheless, the first snow came
quite appropriately at a time when
new views would coincide with the
season, and as we see it, when new
ideas would be much desired, con-
sidering the somewhat overwrought
state of affairs.

With this feeling for new things,
we then would like to bury the dead
in this, our last column for this year.
This attempt will permit, subsequently,
the awakening of still dormant views;
and whatever they may be, they will
be welcome.

The very worthy topics of the
honor system and the tradition at
W&L have been worked over con-
siderably since the beginning of the
year. It seems to us that the neces-
sary seeds have been excellently
planted; and at this stage we contend
that more fruit will develop if quiet
germination is permitted in the usual
undisturbed process. Moreover, we

Interesting Data
On Amherst Life
Shown In Study

By STEVE GALEF

Amherst College, in Massachusetts,
is considered by many to be one of
the best, if not the best, men’s liberal
arts college in the United States.

During the past few years Amherst
has constantly raised its admission and
academic standards to a level once
considered unreasonable by many edu-
cators. The average College Board
scores of its incoming freshmen are
well into the 600’s, and, in addition to
having many extracurricular activities
as prerequisites, most of the students
ranked among the top two or three
in academic standards of their prepar-
atory schools.

The situation has not always been
the same at Amherst. While it was
always one of the country’s top
colleges, its standards for admissions
were not always quite so high. In
fact, in 1956 its admission standards
closely resembled those of Washing-
ton and Lee’s Class of 1964 as far
as College Board score averages are
concerned.

Amherst has just released a “pre-
liminary report” on its Class of 1959
which might prove interesting to us
due to the resemblance between the
two classes. The information was com-
piled in an 89 page report that covered
almost every range of college life. The
authors of the report, members of the
Amherst faculty, attempted to analyze
their findings and present a complete
picture of the members of the Amherst
Class of 1959,

In general, the data is concerned with
general observations. They reveal that
in the area of academic work, the work
week averaged about 60 hours.
Twenty of these hours were spent in
class, and 40 of them involved study.
The time required for freshman study
ranged anywhere from 20 to 70 hours
a week.

The amount of time devoted to
study came to its lowest point dur-
ing the sophomore year. During the
junior and senior years the study
time gradually increased, with the
time spent during the senior year
ranging on the borders of “the fan-
tastic, with some students reporting,
four hours a week and others claim-
ing 60 or more.” The average amount
of time spent in study during the
senior year was around 30 hours,

In the realm of social activity, the
Class of 1959 was found devoting the
largest amount of time to social life
in the sophomore year. By the time
the senior year came, more of the class
was spending time on matters of per-
sonal or solitary interest. While they
all had impressive records of activities
in secondary school, the information
reported in college revealed that over
a third were spending no time in
campus activity during the middle two
years. This percentage increased to
one-half during the senior year.

When determining the amount of
satisfaction received in college, it was
discovered that for the most part, the
amount of satisfaction or dissatisfac-
tion was closely related with the ease
of attainment of goals. Most of this
feeling resulted from the grades re-
ceived in college and adjusting to the
fact that these grades were not as high
as the ones they received in high
school, “By senior year there is evi-
dence of lowering of the level of as-
piration to conform move closely to
actual productivity,”

Connected with this question of
satisfaction, the statistics showed that
the number of students who consid-
ered leaving Amherst “reached a
peak in the sophomore year when 14
per cent...seriously considered
leaving.” Also, in the senior year

Cagers Score First Win

Thackston, Kowalski Star
In Win Over Sewanee

The Washington and Lee Generals
jumped to a quick lead and were never
seriously challenged as they swept to a
78-56 victory over Sewanee in Dore-
mus Gymnasium last Saturday night.

Led by three players in the double
figures and a 53-36 edge on the
boards, Coach McHenry’s quintet
posted its first win in five starts.
Roger Fauber, sophomore from near-
by Lynchburg, threw in six field
goals, went 9 for 11 at the foul lines,
and pulled down 20 rebounds to pace
the Generals attack.

Brett Thackston and Ken Ko-
walski sank 20 and 17 points respec-
tively to aid the Washington and
Lee cause. Freshman center John Mc-
Dowell played a good defensive game
while adding six markers.

Poogie Tomlin with 16, Harry Var-
nell with 11, and Sparky Edgin with
10 points led the Sewanee scoring.

Hitting 30 of 82 field goals the Gen-
erals had a 36.6 shooting percentage
while the University of the South
dumped in 16 of 45 attempts for a
35.5 percent.

The visitors shot better from the
free throw line, making 24 of 30
tries. The Generals only sank 18 of
27 tosses.

After spotting Sewanee an_ initial
basket the Generals took the lead
and never relinquished it to the scrap-
py Sewanee five. By intermission W&L
had run up an eighteen point bulge
and were leading 42-28.

Washington and Lee maintained
its lead in the second half and at
one time had a 25 point spread due
to Kowalski’s four straight set shots.

McHenry substituted freely for the
rest of the contest as the Generals

coasted to a 78-56 triumph. ‘i

 

Swimmers Sink Catholic U.

The Washington and Lee tankmen
kept their winning streak going last
Saturday as they routed Catholic Uni-
versity of Washington, D.C., 65-29, in
the Doremus pool.

Opening up the meet with a victory
in the 400 yd. medley relay, the Gen-
erals were never threatened as they
kept building up their lead.

The showing of the basketball team

'|so far this winter seems to indicate
#| that something is wrong.

“Why can’s they win as the football

‘| team?” “Why is the team made up
‘| primarily of sophomores and juniors?”

“Why can’t we beat teams like Ran-

| dolph-Macon?” These are all questions
| one will hear leveled at the basketball
_| team as a whole and the coach in par-

ticular. While we feel that all this
criticism is fair and valid, we also
believe that the trouble with the
basketball team, and for that matter
with those athletic activities which
are termed “lesser sports,” is not with
the team, coaches, or athletic policy in
particular but with the duties that are
required of the coaches of basketball,
soccer, lacrosse, and baseball.

A Question

The question we would like to ask
is “Why is one coach required to take
care of three sports plus physical edu-
cation classes, another required to
coach two sports plus classes, while
others have only one sport and no
classes.”

This, then, leads us to the basic
problem of the whole athletic pro-
gram( excepting football, as of this
year), and that is the problem of re-
cruiting. One of the related func-
tions of any athletic coach besides that
of coaching his team is that of re-
cruiting. This is especially important
under W&L’s non-subsidized pro-
gram. Here it is particularily import-
ant to encourage the best talent avail-
able to apply for admittance. Recruit-
ing itself is a full time job. It is
through the successful operation of

this recruiting that the football staff
and especially Lee McLaughlin has
been able to get as good a gridiron
team as he has. The job is time con-
suming and occupies the entire foot-
ball Coach’s winter.

Does it not seem reasonable then
that basketball, which according to
attendance records and the place it
holds in athletics, would be just as
time consuming in its related activi-
ties? Apparently, the athletic depart-
ment does not think so. The results
of this line of thought have shown
up so far this winter.

Lighter Load

Our plea is for a lighter load on
these coaches who have under their
direction several important sports, one
following the other, and who as a re-
sult have little time to get out and
pull in some of the better players that
we lose to surrounding schools. As a
result of this we believe that we would
be able not only to have a successful
basketball team, or a successful soccer
team, or a successful baseball team,
but also a successful athletic program
in general.

McHenry Cites
Balanced Attack

Just two short weeks ago we were
about to start the 1960-1961 basketball
season with high hopes, a young
team and no losses. Today we still
have high hopes, a young team, but
four losses. As of last Friday, I
am sure that some of our co-called
pallbearers had already dug an early
grave for the Generals. However, the
boys knew that we had not played well
in the early games. They also knew
we were a much better team than we
had shown.

Last Saturday we played an im-
proved game against Sewanee and
won. We cut down our mistakes, re-
bounded better, and started to shoot
with more confidence. Defensively,
we were more aggressive, which al-
ways helps. Balance is the answer to
our team. We don’t expect to get one
big scorer in every game, but do
want several boys in the 14-20 point
range. If we can get this, any one
player can have an “off-night” and
the others will take up the slack
with no noticeable deficiencies in
our attack.

DECK THE HALLS

The time has come to make out our Christmas shopping lists,
for Christmas will be upon us quicker than you can say Jack
Robinson. (Have you ever wondered, incidentally, about the
origin of this interesting phrase “Quicker than you can say
Jack Robinson’? Well sir, the original phrase was French—
“Plus vite que de dire Jacques Robespierre.’” Jack Robinson is, |
as everyone knows, an anglicization of Jacques Robespierré who */
was, as everyone knows, the famous figure from the French
Revolution who, as everyone knows, got murdered in his bath
by Danton, Murat, Caligula, and Aaron Burr.

(The reason people started saying “Quicker than you can say
Jacques Robespierre (or Jack Robinson as he is called in English-
speaking countries)” is quite an interesting little story. It seems
that Robespierre’s wife, Georges Sand, got word of the plot to
murder her husband in his bath. All she had to do to save his
life was call his name and warn him. But, alas, quicker than
she could say Jacques Robespierre, she received a telegram from
her old friend Frederic Chopin who was down in Majorca setting
lyrics to his immortal “Warsaw Concerto.” Chopin said he
needed Georges Sand’s help desperately because he could not
find a rhyme for “Warsaw.” Naturally, Georges Sand could not
refuse such an urgent request.

(Well sir, Georges Sand went traipsing off to Majorca, but
before she left she told her little daughter Walter that some bad
men were coming to murder daddy in his bath, and she in-
structed Walter to shout Robespierre’s name when the bad men
arrived. But Walter, alas, had been sea-bathing that morning
on the Riviera, and she had come home loaded with sea shells
and salt water taffy, and when the bad men came to murder
Robespierre, Walter, alas, was chewing a big wad of salt water
taffy and could not get her mouth open in time to shout a
warning. Robespierre, alas, was murdered quicker than you
could shout Jacques Robespierre (or Jack Robinson as he is
called in the English-speaking countries).

(There is, I am pleased to report, one small note of cheer in
this grisly tale. When Georges Sand got to Majorca where
Chopin was setting lyrics to his immortal “Warsaw Concerto,”
she was happily able to help him find a rhyme for ‘‘Warsaw,”
as everyone knows who has heard those haunting lyrics:

In the fair town of Warsaw,

Which Napoleon’s horse saw,

Singing cockles and mussels, alive alive o!)

 

But I digress.

We were speaking of Christmas gifts. What we all strive to do
at Christmas is, of course, to find unusual, offbeat, different
gifts for our friends. May I suggest then a carton of Marlboro
Cigarettes?

What? You are astonished? You had not thought of Marlboros
as unusual, offbeat, different? You had regarded them as familiar,
reliable smokes whose excellence varied not one jot or tittle
from year to year?

True. All true. But at the same time, Marlboros are unusual,
offbeat, different, because every time you try one, it’s like the
first time. The flavor never palls, never gets hackneyed. Each
Marlboro is a fresh delight, a pristine pleasure, and if you want
all your friends to clap their hands and exclaim, ‘Yes, Virginia,
there is a Santa Claus!” you will put them at the very top of
your Christmas list.

And for further Yuletide joy, give Marlboro’s nonfiltered
companion cigarette, mild, flavorful Philip Morris—in regu-
lar size or the sensational new king-size Commander. You'll
be welcome aboard!

Amherst Study

(Continued from page 2)

“more than a quarter of the class re-
ported their belief that they would
have enjoyed their senior year in
a coeducational college.”

When investigating the smoking and
drinking habits of the Class of 1959, the
authors found that “while there is
little change in smoking habits, these
having been more firmly established
prior to college, there is a systematic
increase in the number who drink.”
By the senior year about three-fourths

 

to lend someone your dance plan, but
because it is dishonorable to break
your word,

 

said they drank some form of alco-
holic beverage, and 56 per cent smoked.
Then too, “while 42 men reported hav-
ing passed out during the freshman
year, only 14 seniors reported having
done so.”

The purpose of presenting some of
the findings of this report is not par-
ticularly for a comparison. While it is
very hard not to do this, we must real-
ize that in spite of all of the similarities,
there are many differences between
our Class of 1964 and their Class of
1959.

Aware of the trend that has come
to Amherst since the time covered
by this report, we wonder what a
statistical analysis of the Amherst
Class of 1964 would reveal? We
are curious...

 

Raven Rants On
(Continued from page 2)

The old issues—political, social, and
economic—must continue to be de-
bated. Nevertheless, this does not pre-
clude the possibility of the debaters
to seek out new and fresh views which,
in the long run, will perhaps benefit
the cause more than the usual proce-
dure of harping on the old ones.

For instance, politically speaking,
Kennedy is in. The situation, the new
Democratic administration, must be ac-
cepted. For the sake of added effi-
ciency and desired change, we recom-
mend that the old criticisms—particu-
larly the ones used in the campaign—
be put aside. As criticisms are a ben-

 

eficial aspect of the democratic way,
may we suggest that these necessary
items be rejuvenated, at least sprinkled
with freshness.

A rejuvenation in our way of life as
students, it seems, would be beneficial.
Indeed the apathetic, lethargic, and
complacent student on the W&L com-
pus is not in the minority. To spark
ourselves with new interests, to activ-
ate untried views, and ideas, to aban-
don our customary vegetative exis-
ence, and to resume our position as
“nature’s most highly endowed crea-
ture’—let these be our aspirations for
the new year. Let us propose to en-
liven surroundings that have become
intellectually drowsy for lack of sin-
cere efforts on the part of everyone of
us.

When Jim Boardman took his B.S. in Elec-
trical Engineering at Colorado State, there was
one idea uppermost in his mind. He wanted a
job in which he could work his way into man-
agement via the engineering route. As he puts
it, “I didn’t want to stick with straight engi-
neering all my life.”

After talking to eight other organizations

Mountain States Telephone &

Telegraph Company. He soon got the kind of
action he was looking for.

His first assignment: How best to improve
widely scattered rural telephone service all over
Colorado—a sticky engineering challenge. He
was given a free hand to work out his own pro-
cedures. His boss simply said, ‘Find the answer,
Jim—and bring it back.”

“Our number one aim is to have in all
management jobs the most vital, intelli-
gent, positive and imaginative men we
can possibly find.”
FREDERICK R. KApPPEL, President
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.

“FIND THE ANSWER, JIM—AND BRING IT BACK’

Six months later, Jim turned in his recom-
mendations. His plan was accepted.

Next stop: Colorado Springs. Here Jim
worked out a plan to expand telephone facilities
for this burgeoning community. This plan, too,

is now in operation.

Today, at 24, Jim has an important role in
planning where, how much, and what kind of
telephone service is needed in the Denver area.

Here’s how Jim puts it: “We get tough assign-
ments— but we also have the freedom to take hold
and doa job. I think the future here is unlimited.
If a man wants to do it—it’s there to be done.”

If you're a guy who can “Find the answer—
and bring it back” —you’ll want to get with a com-
pany where you have the chance. Visit your Place-
ment Office for literature and additional information.
