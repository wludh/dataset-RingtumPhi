Dance Set Has Oriental Flavor;

 

Formal Dance Tonight Opens Springs

Waterfall Highlights Decor

By R. ROY GOODWIN
Assistant Managing Editor
A number of top-flight entertain-
ers will spotlight this year’s Spring
Dances Weekend, which officially
opened at 4 p.m. today with a cock-
tail party given for the dance set
president, Bill Outman, a PiKA
junior from Bethesda, Md.

Headlining the party given for
Outman were performances by such
groups as the Five Royals and
the Royal Rockers, groups that
both hail from New York.

Perhaps the most awaited event
of the weekend, however, won't
take place until tonight at 9 p.m.
when the formal dance to be held
in Doremus Gymnasium begins.
Featured at tonight’s dance will be
the appearance of Woody Herman
and his orchestra.

Doremus Gymnasium, the site for
both tonight’s affair and tomorrow’s
concert which will feature jazz-
pianist Ahmad Jamal, is decorated
as “Shangri-La,” a theme taken from
James Hilton’s book, The Lost Hori-
zon.

Concert Saturday From 3-5

Jamal will appear from 3-5 p.m.
Saturday and will be accompanied
by his group known as the “Ahmad
Jamal Trio.”

Dance officials reminded students
today that conventional dress will
be required at the concert Saturday,
and that formal dress is required for
entrance to the dance tonight.

Ray Robrecht To Represent W&L
At National ODK Assemblage

Ray Robrecht, Intermediate Law
student from Plainfield, N. J., will
represent the Washington and Lee
Chapter of Omicron Delta Kappa at
its National Convention. The Con-
vention will be held in Stillwater
Okla., on April 28.

Meet in Tulsa

As a delegate representing the
Alpha Circle, Robrecht will meet
with delegates from colleges and
universities throughout the nation
to discuss problems in American
institutions of higher learning. Also
to be exchanged are views and ideas

LCDR Littlejohn To Speak
On Naval Reserve Program

LCDR E. C. Littlejohn, United
States Naval Reserve, will be avail-
able in Washington Hall April 20
to answer any questions on the
Reserved Officer Candidate Program
(ROC).

He will be on campus from 1
p.m. until 3 p.m. and will return
during the same hours on May 11
so that students may give serious
thought and make advance plan-
ning for next year’s school session.

Commander Littlejohn said the
ROC program is designed for those
students who wish Naval officer
training during college. It is not
available to seniors. Upon gradua-~-
uation, Reserve Officer Candidates
are commissioned Reserve Officers
and serve three years with the ac-
tive fleet forces.

 

 

A figure will be held at 10:15 to-
night and will be highlighted by
the appearance of the dance-set
president accompanied with his date,
along with the six vice-presidents
and their dates.

Members of the Figure

Set president, Bill Outman, will
escort an American University stu-
dent in the figure. She is Miss Sally
Rockwell.

Following the appearance of the
president of the dance will be the
entrance of the six vice-presidents
and their dates.

Vice-president in charge of the
figure, Grantham Couch, Beta junior
from Shreveport, La., will escort
Miss Betty McCorskey, a student at
Randolph Macon Women’s College.

Elliott Maynard, a PiKA junior
from Portland, Me., vice-president
in charge of decorations will escort
Miss Nancy Maynard, a student at
Mary Washington.

Vice-president in charge of pub-
licity, Roy Goodwin, a KA junior
from Augusta, Ga., will escort Miss
Kittie Graham from Augusta. She
attended the University of Georgia.

George Van Sciver, in charge of
invitations, will escort Miss Barbara
Ann Mason from Bethlehem, Pa.
Van Sciver is a Phi Psi junior from
Bethlehem.

Vice-president in charge of the
production staff, Jerome Dattel, is a
ZBT from Ruleville, Miss. He will
escort Miss Kathleen Day, a student

on the remedy of existing campus
problems.
New Circle

Another important issue to be
brought before the body will be
the admission of the University of
Tulsa as new Circle. Also, prepara-
tions will begin for the 50th An-
niversary of Omicron Delta Kappa
in 1664.

Leadership Group

Omicron Delta Kappa, with circles
at most leading colleges and uni-;
versities of the nation, was founded
at Washington and Lee in 1914 as
an honorary leadership fraternity.

Qualifications

Membership is based on participa-
tion and leadership in five areas of
student life: student government,
publications, athletics, social and
religious affairs, and speech, drama,
and other arts.

Superior scholarship and character
are also necessary for member-
ship consideration.

Notices

There will be a meeting of Pi
Sigma Alpha on Tuesday, April 18,
at 7:30 p.m. in Newcomb 8.

at Hollins College.

In charge of the cocktail given
for Outman is Beverly DuBose, a
PiKA junior from Atlanta, Ga. He
will escort Miss Kathy Allen, a
student at Hollins College.

Several members from the Cotil-
lion Club will also take part in the
figure.

Doremus Gymnasium, which is
decorated as “Shangri-La” for the
dance, will take on an oriental flav-
or at tonight’s dance. Highlighting

 

this set’s decorations will be murals
placed around the walls of the dance
floor, and the construction of a
Chinese pagoda.

A small pond with accompanying
waterfall will complete the major
decorations for the dance floor it-
self, Outman said in an earlier edi-
tion of the Ring-tum Phi.

The entertainment for this year’s
Spring Dances represents a mile-
stone in the history of the set,
Outman said today.

Five Royals Start Weekend

Beginning the weekend with an
unexpected bang was today’s ap-
pearance of the “fabulous” Five
Royals and the Royal Rockers Or-
chestra.

Recording for King Records and
on Old Town label, the Five Royals
have become nationally known for
their renditions of such songs as
“Think” and “Please, Please, Please.”
The group is under contract from
Universal Attractions of New York
City.

Appearing at tonight’s dance from
9-1 a.m. is Woody Herman and his
orchestra. Last year, Herman was
the fourth ranked clarinet player in
the nation by the Playboy All-Star
Jazz poll.

Herman is well-known for his ar-
rangements of “Perfido” and “I Ain’t
Got Nothin’ but the Blues.”

Benny Goodman, who was ex-
pected to play for the dance will not
appear because a section of his
band had been signed earlier to play
on a national television show.

Jamal To Play Saturday
In the spotlight Saturday from
3-5 p.m. will be Ahmad Jamal,
a well-known jazz pianist.
Recording on Epic label, and later

 

on Argo, and now on Columbia,
Jamal has reached the peak of suc-
cess with jazz fans.

One of Jamal’s most unique fea-
tures is that he never plays a tune
the same way twice. He has ex-
plained that he keeps finding it
possible to express himself in new
ways, and even after playing a song
a hundred times he still manages
to put something new and different
into its presentation.

Being his own worst critic, Ahmad
Jamal is constantly improving and
changing his technique and style.
Because of this and the undeniable
individuality of his personality, it
is certain that the concert this
Spring will be one of the most
memorable in the history of the
W&L social scene.

Outman announced today that a
number of persons were assisting
with the decorating of Doremus
Gymnasium.

Working on the pagoda were
Barry Grove, John Graham, Ken
Kowalski and Steve Cook.

Aiding with art work were Tom
Dols, Ed Dickson, John White,
Bruce Houghton, Conway Shield,
George Sisler, Charles Stevenson,
Chet White, and Tony Burget.

 

SIPA Convention To Hear
Historian Dowdy April 28

More than 1,000 high school jour-
nalists and faculty advisors will reg-
ister at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity Thursday, April 27, for the
32nd Annual Convention of the
Southern Interscholastic Press Asso-
ciation, April 28-29,

They will represent some 175
prepratory and high schools from
nine Southern states and the Dis-
trict of Columbia. Participating
schools have entered over 300 pub-
lications in annual competition for
awards and recognition, and the
highlight of the two-day conven-
tion will be the awarding of tro-
phies to first-place winners at the
concluding awards luncheon Satur-
day.

Convention activities get under-
way Friday morning with a full
program of critiques, workshops,
short courses, roundtables and lec-
tures scheduled, all aimed at im-

 

proving excellence in scholastic pub-
lishing.

Several general sessions will give
delegates opportunities to hear ad-
dresses by James P. Warburg, noted
economist and author; Clifford
Dowdy, Civil War historian; and
Jack Mendelsohn, King Features
Syndicated creator of the comic
strip “Jacky’s Diary.”

At the awards luncheon, 17 SIPA
trophies will go to top entries in
newspaper, yearbook, magazine, and
radio competition. Four special
awards will honor the outstanding
student newspapers of Virginia,
North Carolina, West Virginia, and
South Carolina.

The convention is sponsored by
the Lee Memorial Journalism Foun-
dation, under the direction of Prof.
O. W. Riegel, head of Washington
and Lee’s Department of Journalism
and Communications.

 

ROTC Has Field Problem
Under ‘Battle Conditions’

From time to time during the
past week people on the Hill and
around town have been hearing
the sounds of simulated war, rang-
ing from blank rounds being fired
from M-1 rifles to green and white
flares exploding in the vicinity of
the Liberty Hall ruins.

All the action and noise is part
of a training exercise currently be-
ing conducted on Tuesday and
Thursday afternoons by the W&L
ROTC Department. The general pur-
pose is to give the cadets actual
field practice in maneuvers of the
platoon attack variety.

The general plan of the problem
is for the company going through
the problem to move to an assembly
area where the problem becomes one

 

of platoons attacking an objective
in the vicinity of the Liberty Hall
ruins.

Each platoon goes through the
problem individually with empha-
sis on the platoon leaders coordinat-
ing their attack plan with those of
the squad leaders to seize and hold
an objective, subject to a counter
attack staged by an aggressor force.

Supervision of the problem from
the cadre officer standpoint is being
handled by Capts. Hall and Miller.
The main emphasis, however, is on
the Cadet Corps running the prob-
lems itself and handling the criti-
ques after the problem has been
completed by each platoon.

THE RING

Unnecessary Neglect

We are aware of the fact that eventually Washington and
Lee will be granted new athletic facilities. We are also cognizant
of the fact that such improvement cannot be forthcoming in
the very near future because of the lists of priority and the
limits of physical possibility. For this reason, we question now
how the athletic department plans to operate until the needed
construction becomes a reality.

Unfortunately, when the Ring-tum Phi inquired recently
into a situation of serious concern to many students—namely,
the condition of the exercise, or weight room, we were received
with dubious cordiality, to say the very least, by a member of
the department. This coach, who is responsible for the equip-
ment and physical facilities of the gym, resented any reference
to the deplorable condition of some of that building’s resources
and question our right of inquiry. We were criticized severely
for “daring” to explore into the department’s operation in
cited areas. He complained, furthermore, that student neglect
in caring for equipment was the determining factor in the
refusal by the department to concern itself with repair and
replacement.

We would like to point out to the athletic department that
included in the University Fee of $70.00, which every student
pays with each semester’s tuition, is a provision for recreational

 

facilities and equipment along with other lesser costs of ad-.

ministration (services of the university physician and nurse, use
of library, and religious work.) Along with this allocation, each
student is required to submit, via his fraternity, an intramural
fee of $3.00 per man to cover the expenditures of that pro-
gram. (We are not including normal physical education fees
in our costing for these. are laboratory fees for recognized
classes.)

Because of this distribution to the athletic department of
compulsory student funds, we feel that there is gross derelic-
tion on the part of the department in assuring adaquate facili-
ties and equipment. Whether or not the weight room was the
victim of student neglect, or just fair wear and tear, is not the
point at issue. We feel that the students of this university are
paying for the use of well-equipped and adequate facilities,
and it is incumbent upon the athletic department to provide
them, either by repair or replacement of equipment in those
areas under question. Two excellent projects at hand could be
the weight room, as intimated, and the handball courts, where
faulty electric lights have greatly handicapped their use.

It’s Spring?

It’s Spring. Everyone agrees but the weatherman. We
understand he is among those who are holding out for Day-
light Savings Time so we can be an hour earlier getting to
Hollins or wherever, so, maybe he is on our side after all.

We can tell it’s Spring more readily by listening to the
laughter from the Troubadour Theater or watching the crowds
at the VMI Fieldhouse than by heeding the weatherman. The
annual Spring Musical presented by the SWMSFC is certainly
one of the best bits of art we have seen—locally anyway. Frank-
ly we are envious of Steve Danzansky’s nimble mind and talent
for turning a subtle phrase, not to mention his musical abilities.
We were in the first night audience which traditionally is slightly
less skeptical than second night audiences. But every effort
by Danzansky and the actors was met by a resounding round
of applause. It was delightful. A special pat on the back is
deserved by Gene Johnson and the orchestra for some fine
musical presentations. We hope you are to be among the sell-
out crowds this weekend.

The Valley Sports Show last weekend was a success, too,
thanks no little bit to the demonstrations and exhibitions by
VMI, W&L, Sweet Briar and UVa. students. We enjoyed
watching Ray Robrecht win his eleventh amateur bout almost
as much as hearing “Let’s Have an Organized Orgy.”

The purpose of this writing, however, is to welcome every-
one to Spring Dances. Actually you should know we are glad
to have you here and thus need no special welcome. We do
caution you to drive carefully this weekend and not get your
fuel supplies mixed—seriously.

After much frustration to the Dance Board and the Spring
Dance President, Woody Herman and Ahmad Jamal have
been contracted to play. If the preliminaries of obtaining them
are any indication, they should present an outstanding per-
formance. So, from the Ring-tum Phi staff, we wish you a

An “Estimate Of The Situation”

Is Necessary |

By ROBERT C. KETCHAM

Friday Columnist

Every country’s foreign policy
necessarily addresses itself to the
external situa-
tions that chal-
lenge it. However,
in light of the fact |
that these exter- |
nal situations are |
largely unknown, |
those making and!
evaluating the
the policy must!
resort to some “es- |
timate of the sit-|
uation.”

This country’s
citizens realize the fact, I think, that
we are in effect at war with the
Soviet Union. What is disturbing to |
this writer is the method of analysis
demonstrated by debates inside the
government and by the public as
to the nature of that challenge as
individuals make their “estimate.”

Most of us were brought up be-
lieving that there are two kinds of
people in the world, the good and)
the wicked. Even the Second World!
War was conducted on the theory
that the world was essentially divid-

 

ib

The duality which this view rep-
resents is immensely helpful in
making and evaluating foreign
policy in that it realizes the con-
tradictions within which the hu-
man must work, and thus allows
a better grasp of the broad essen-
tials.

What then is this dualism? First
of all there is the original objective
of the Soviet Union to accomplish
a world revolution. Under the defi-
nition as originally conceived noth-
-ing but conflict with the non-Com-
munist world could be conducted.
It did not permit deceptions of ex-
pedienecy such as political warfare
or mutual obligations such as were
encompassed by the UN charter,
but total conflict.

The blunt question of survival
which has been raised by the rapid
growth of technology now serves
to contradict the previous total con-
flict notion. The Soviet Union has

|much more to lose today by war

than at the time its idealogy was
formulated and effected by the rev-
olution. Therefore, an avoidance of

 

ed between the “peace loving” and |
the “aggressor” forces. This assump- |
tion represented a philosophy which |
was to explain both history and hu-
man behavior. |

The simplicity of an either-or
approach is no more adequate to
explain the nature of the Soviet
challenge than it was to simplify
the conduct of our peoples to-
toward the enemy in the war and
the nations left by the peace.

Today the attempt to abstract
events in simple terms finds argu-
ment by one group that the Soviets
are single-mindedly pursuing the
objective of world revolution, and
by the other that they are genu-
inely trying to relax tension by
limiting their arms and avoiding
war.

Most thoughtful persons would
find a definite lack in this simplicity
of evaluation, that there is some-
thing inherantly wrong with such
an approach.

The first flag of warning is the!

knowledge that the world remains
essentially ambiguous, that it is
not a clearly defined and ordered

abode because of various conflicting |

notions. Hegelian dialectic has had
a great influence on the way men
think today, as Germaine Bree
pointed out last Monday evening.

The process of thesis, antithesis and |

synthesis aids in defining and un-
derstanding the contradictory.

total war evolves as a more com-
plete objective of the Soviet policy.
Nor can we in our own country

| hope to find an either-or approach

to meet this dualistic challenge. In
this dangerous era when the con-
tradictions of policy must evolve into
a whole it is as necessary that we
too understand.

We must strengthen our common
| unity in NATO, for example, and
| at the same time aid the underde-
veloped countries struggling for
' betterment. Taking the Soviet chal-
| lenge as an example of the dualist’s
| approach in estimating the situation
we must put forth our own positivis-
tic policy.

As Louis Halle, a professor at
The Institute of International
Studies, Geneva, says, the policy
must be like a_ gentle knight,
strong and determined to hold his
own while at the same time con-
cilitory so as to manifest every
intention to reduce the danger of
| war.

Such a system of analysis defies

in terms of black and white. Such
a condition can be illustrated by
the U.S.’s former position as re-
gards neutralist nations.

 

| Under the U.S.’s general assent |

‘to the Geneva Agreement of 1954
| we were desirous of respecting the
“sovereignty, the independence, the
unity and the territorial integrity”
of Laos, At that time “unity” could

Questionnaire From The Library
Leaves Room For Other Reasons

Friday Columnist

As you all know, this column is,
pre-recorded and served up to you a|

never have the)

when its __iast

So I try to stay
ahead and write
this thing on Wed-
nesday. And this, as I write, is an
average day.

I was made aware of the fact that |
this is an average day by a big}
sign at the library, which said, for |
those of you who subscribe to your
own magazine and don’t go to the
library, TAKE ONE. For a minute I
thought that they (the little pieces
of paper under the sign) were Peace
Corps applications or something, so
I started around the display without-
out taking one. I couldn’t get away
so easily. Mr. Coleman jumped from
his hiding place in the phone booth,
and looking over his glasses that are
specially made to be looked over,
he said:

“Oh, no you don’t Craven, take

one.

Since it was relatively early in
the morning, I took one. And what
was it, but a questionnaire asking
me what I’m doing in the library,
listing a lot of reasons for coming
to the place, and saying “Check
only those applicable.” So I started
to check, but there wasn’t a blank
for what I had come for. As a
matter of fact, I have never gone

sheet, and I don’t know of anyone}

who has. So instead of all the rea-

sons like “To do assigned reading,”
and “To Study” here are a few put
down in the “Other Reasons (speci-
fy)” blank.

1. It was raining, and I was caught
without my raincoat.

2. I was thirsty and this is the
nearest water fountain.

3. I wanted to see if the new Na-

| 4. I wanted to check on the new
cartoon book in the browsing room.
5. I’m a Friend of the Library and
I drop in once a day for chats.

There is another section of the
quiz, and it has to do with listing
materials used on your visit. There

part, so you'll have to put down

only have been achieved with the
consent of the Communist-led Pathet
Lao who were already established
in the country.

The US., far from being commit-
ted to a _neutralist government,
which was representative of the
countryside chose to support a mi-
nority and poured in $300 million
in military aid. By not choosing to
risk endorsing the neutralist regime
and by this very act allowing count-
ervailing forces to offset the influ-
ence of the Pathet Lao the Com-
munists were unengaged politically
and left free to fight.

The example used is oversimpli-
fied but no more so than was the
reasoning which rejected the neu-
tralist party in power because they
were not the “good” guys like the
anti-Communists.

It is equally as narrow to say
that we must maintain a militant
foreign policy, or conversely, that
no money should be spent for de-
fense because it would really be
better to help those poor deserv-
ing countries with rising expec-
tations.

The dualistic approach advocated
is certainly not all that is needed,
but at least it does away with the
absurdities proposed by black-
whites, the absolutists.

 

LETTERS

TO THE

pitoR

This letter is written because I
take exception to what was said in
the letter from “A Southerner”
which appeared in the Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi.

The Honor System is not an “ar-
chaic institution” which is passe.
Honor is an ideal which is cherished
not only by gentlemen but by men
everywhere. If men of integrity and
sensitivity have anything to do with
it, Honor will continue to be an ideal.

Man has a divided loyalty. It is
not simply a matter of loyalty to
a friend as opposed to loyalty to a
system. To call the practical side
of loyalty to an ideal “tale-bearing”
is to refuse to look at the issue in
an adult framework. “When I was
a child, I spoke like a child, I thought
like a child, I reasoned like a child;
when I became a man, I gave up
childish ways.” As_ one’s. world
broadens from childhood to adult-
hood, the area of his loyalties must
grow, and he must see things in
different perspectives. We do not
need to be exhorted to return to the
ways of little children—we are still
struggling to leave them behind.

Part of the purpose of the Hon-
or System is to teach us to live re-
sponsibly with our neighbors. We
can learn this lesson best if the
responsibility for the success of our
society rests squarely on our own
shoulders.

This political situation is nothing
short of undemocratic. It means that
most of the occupants of our student
body positions are chosen by a clique
of leaders in one party rather than
by the student body as a whole.

The difference in size between
the two parties is made a greater
evil by the fact that neither party
advocates any policy or anything.
Campaigns for office are made up
of superficial rallies and hand-
shaking. This gives the student
body a chance to see whether the
candidates are good guys—which,
of course, all of them are—but lit-
tle else is accomplished. Candi-
dates never propose any import-

to carry out if elected, and
they never feel it is necessary to
defend the status quo.

like to know what next year’s stu-

proposals before I vote for these
leaders. To make such a discussion
a pert of a candidste’s campaign
seems to me one of the best ways
to educate the student body about
how the Honor System works.

Second, I hope that this year’s
candidates will be able to present
concrete proposals on how our elec-
tion system can be improved. I have
no such proposals other than those
presented in this column and in my
column for March 24. But I will
pledge my vote, with hopes that it
cen mean something, to the candi-
date who presents proposals which
I think are workable.

Sororitys’ Abolition

By HARVEY ALLEN

Apparently time is running out
for sororities and fraternities at an
increasing number of colleges and
univeristies across the country. Just
last spring the last of the neighboring
girls’ schools to have _ sororities,
Randolph-Macon, lost them as the
result of action proposed by the
school’s administration and approved
by the Board of Trustees.

At the time the action was pro-
posed, we are told that there was
very strong feeling both “for” and
“against” keeping the sororities. An
official poll of the student body,
reprinted in the Sun Dial, the school
paper, showed that a clear majority
of the students favored keeping the
sororities.

All of that is history now. In an

 

‘Bill Bowen | effort to find out what changes had

occurred since last year and to
see what were the immediate effects

 

Creates Many Woes

of the abolition of sororities, we
talked with some of the ‘Macon
girls, mostly sophomores. We picked
sophomores primarily because they
are the only girls who have been
around for almost an equal amount
of time both with and without so-
rorities.

It came as no surprise that for-
mer members of sororities may no
longer meet as a group.

The houses on sorority row which
were once alive with parties dur-
ing Rush Week each September and
which hosted various parties during
the school year are now silent by
comparison. The houses are used
now, but not nearly so much as
before. Some of the girls still gather
there, but not as they had done last
year and before.

It was announced last year that
new clubs would appear this year

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Kell Breaks Hop, Step, Jump Mark

 

Trackmen Keep Rolling, Smash
Downtrodden UR, 941-3---45 2-3

W&L’s track steamroller contin-
ued to flatten its oppenents Thurs-
day as Coach Norm Lord’s crew
smashed the University of Rich-
mond, 94 1/3-45 2/3.

Led by Jim Hickey’s and Robin
Kell’s ten-point performances, the
General thinclads steamed to their
llth straight dual meet win. They
are 4-0 so far this year.

Coming within six points of go-
ing over the century mark for the
third time this year, the track-
men grabbed all three places in
the broad jump, pole vault, and
two-mile. In all they racked up 11
firsts, ten seconds, and 11 thirds.

Kell, a 6-2 freshman jumper, bet-
tered the school record in the hop,
step, and jump with a leap of 41’
10 5/8”. The old mark was 40’ 11”,
set last year by Ed Corcorran.

It was only by stroke of fate that
Kell broke the record. After three
jumps he had decided to quit. But
after a few moments rest, he came
back and broke the record on two
successive jumps. His first record-
breaking jump was 41’ 5”. Kell also
took first place in the high jump
with a jump of 57”.

Hickey, “the South Boston
speedster,” was slowed down by
a muddy track, but still won the
100 and 220. He ran a 0:10.4 in the
100 and a :23.4 in the 220.

Other standout stars against the
Spiders were Ken Kowalski, Ed
Meyers, and George Cruger.

Kowalski threw the javelin the
fartherest of his college career—
172’ 8 1/2”. He nosed out Richmond’s
ace javelin thrower, Bill Venture, for
first.

Jokingly after the meet, some-
one told Kowalski, “See what
practice does.” Ken, better known
as “the Killer,” quickly agreed,
“The time I spent practicing my
steps this week certainly helped.”

Meyers became the seventh track-; and Dave Callaway clear 11’.

man to go on Coach Lord’s steak
list when he vaulted 12’. Coach Lord
gives a steak to any trackman who
betters the 1960 time or distance in
his event. Last year’s top mark in
the pole vault was 11’ 6”.

Meyers paced the pole vault sweep
which saw Jim Parker vault 11’ 6”

In the broad jump sweep Henry
Sackett leaped 20’ 1 3/4”, Tom
Edwards jumped 20’ 1/2”, and
Bobby Brewer made 19’ 8”.

Distance strong man Mike Shank
led the W&L one-two-three punch
in the two-mile. Stoney Duffey fin-

ished second and Ed Garretson, third.

Other winners for the Generals in-
cluded Mack Brownlee, mile, 4:49.8;
Skip Essex, 880, 2:06.8; and Cruger,
discus, 121’ 10”.

The Generals’ next meet is Thurs -
day, April 20 against Hampden-
Sydney at Wilson Field.

 

After last year’s final baseball
game, a 1-0 victory over West Vir-
ginia in thirteen innings, Coach
Joe Lyles was heard to remark
that for the first time that season,
the team looked like a coherent
unit.

Apparently the layoff between
seasons hasn’t hurt this feeling of

 

 

‘|one triple among their 33 hits.

unity. The Generals have turned
in a heads-up, team effort in the field
so far this season, and have already
equalled their win total for last year.
They’re now 3-2 against college
competition, and haven’t even play-
ed Lynchburg and West Virginia, the
teams they beat last year.

So far the diamondmen have
topped Harvard, William and
Mary, and Norfolk William and
Mary, all by two runs or more.
Their losses came at the hands of
Elon and North Carolina State.

Phil Sharp pitched the Generals
to a 6-0 win over Harvard, blank-

 

ing the Maroons on four hits. Roy |
“the Panther” Carpenter won at.
William and Mary by pitching eight
innings. Freshman righthander Penn |
Way won in relief against Norfolk |

Golfers Win Third In Row, Topple
Lynchburg, 6-3, Vardaman Shoots 73

Moving from snow-covered
course to a aan’ course, the W&L
golf team still continued its win-
ning streak, as it rapped Lynchburg,
6-3, Thursday at the Lexington Golf
Course.

Captain Jack Vardaman was the
medalist with a 73 on the par-71
Lexington course. Grantham Couch
had a 75.

The win was the third straight
against no losses for the golfers.
Monday they toppled West Vir-
ginia, 6 1/2-2 1/2, on the snow-
covered Homestead course.

In the Lynchburg match, Varda-
man defeated Litz Beavars, 5-4,

and Couch topped George Johnson, '

5-4, in the first flight. Washington
and Lee won the best ball, 6-5.

In the second flight Willie Lee
edged John Cardwell, 3-2, and

Lynchburg’s Jim Alexander beat,
Ronnie Stewart,
captured the best ball, 2-1.

Steve Henry defeated Bill John-
son, 3-2, and Lynchburg’s Dan
Martin edged Jack Neal, 1-up, in
the final flight. Washington and
Lee won the best ball, 4-3.

Coach E. P. Twombly said, “All
the boys have played pretty well so

far. But we really haven’t had a
decent day weatherwise. We've
played in snow, wind, rain, and

mud.”

Fauber Grabs 31st In NCAA College Rebound Totals,
First W@L Player In National Figures Since Flora

NOT SINCE Dom Flora, W&L’s ‘Mr. Basketball,” have
the Generals placed anybody in the nation’s basketball leaders.
Not until this year at least.

In recently released NCAA College Division final basket-
ball statistics, Rodger “‘Bip’’ Fauber, a 6-2 hustler, placed 31st
in the top 50 rebounders.

Fauber pulled down 302 rebounds in 18 games for

a 16.8 average per game. Leading the college division

was Virginia Union’s Bill Jackson with a 24.7 mark.

Had it not been for several off games early in the season,
Fauber would have made the top 20. As it was his average was
only 1.1 off the 20th spot.

Fauber’s best performance came in W&L’s 78-68 upset of
downtrodden Virginia. Bip grabbed 24 rebounds and scored
26 points. *

Mud Hampers Catchers: One Slides, One Bogs Down

BUNTS HAVE BEEN an unusual center of amusement at
Washington and Lee’s baseball games this year.

General pitcher Penn Way put down a perfect sacrifice
bunt against Norfolk William and Mary Monday. The bunt
|was so perfect that the W&M catcher couldn’t get the ball
‘out of the mud in front of home plate.

Jim Russ, W&L catcher, needs a lesson in fielding bunts
on a muddy field. In the second inning against Norfolk, Russ
dashed after a bunt and wound up practicing his sliding.

 

Hickey Breaks 220 Record With Father Watching
DR. JAMES HICKEY, who attends nearly all of W&L’s

track meets and football games, was happier than usual March

Dr. Hickey had reason to be happy—his son Jim, a star
trackman and football player at W&L, picked up his third
and fourth first places of the track season.

to take the place of the sororities,
in order to continue the communi-
cation between the members of the
four classes at "Macon. This has not
happened.

Today the "Macon girl finds a
lack of contact with large num-
bers of her fellow students. This
was not evident last year due to
weekly contacts formed by the com-
mon interests and experiences found
in sororities.

Everyone on this campus knows
what roles our fraternities play in
encouraging and interesting fresh-
men and sophomores to enter into
school activities and to take interest
in the general activities of the Uni-
versity. Sororities at "Macon did the
same. Without sororities, the incen-
tive to participate in extra-curricu-
lar activities just doesn’t exist any-
more.

Counting all of the offices and
duties within the sororities them-
selves, there were about ninety po-
sitions of leadership and respon-
sibility. With these positions now
gone, the potential of inany students
now goes untapped.

But then people say that these
girls should be able to have the
same goals as before, and that they
could support other activities. Real-
ly? Take for example the recent
blood drive at "Macon. Previously
it was quite successful and enjoyed
a good turnout each year, but not so

this year.

With reference to our fraternity
system here, we all know of the
emphasis that is placed on academic
achievement within our houses, par-
ticularly for the freshmen. The in-
terest which sororities formerly had
in encouraging freshmen at "Macon
is now absent. The same goes for
upperclassmen, we are told.

On the social side of life, the up-
perclassmen say that they are not
able to become as well acquainted
with the freshmen as before. The op-
portunities are just not there, ex-
cept for the “mixers” and such at
the beginning of the year. It has
come to the point that now most
freshmen and many sophomores
know only a few girls outside of
their hall and dorm.

Along with this restricted com-
munication between a large number
of girls comes the problem of getting
dates each weekend. If you've tried
getting more than a couple of “blind”

for fruitful debate. Proposals on
such items as dance-set improve-

planks in a candidate’s or party’s
platform.

The enthusiastic candidate should
find many more ways to express his
policies. Speeches at rallies and
newspaper columns could both be
utilized. A debate between the lead-
ing candidates will be possible if
there is any disagreement between
them, and I hope there will be.

The advantages of this type of
campaigning are many. It would en-
able students to get a clearer view
of candidates and their positions in
regard to campus matters. It would
force candidates to think through
their policies before they are elect-
ed. It would educate the student
body on issues discussed. And it
might lead to some _ significant
changes.

Loves of Dobie Gillis” , etc.)

THE DEAN YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN

Now in the waning days of the school year when the hardest
heart grows mellow and the very air is charged with memories,
let us pause for a moment and pay tribute to that overworked
and underappreciated campus figure, your friend and mine, the
dean of students.

Policeman and confessor, shepherd and seer, warden and
oracle, proconsul and pal, the dean of students is by far the
most enigmatic of all academicians. How can we understand
him? Well sir, perhaps the best way is to take an average day
in the life of an average dean. Here, for example, is what hap-
pened last Thursday to Dean Killjoy N. Damper of Duluth
A and M.

At 6 a.m. he woke, dressed, lit a Marlboro, and went up on
the roof of his house to remove the statue of the Founder which
had been placed there during the night by high-spirited under-
graduates.

At 7 a.m. he lit a Marlboro and walked briskly to the campus.
(The Dean had not been driving his car since it had been placed
on the roof of the girls dormitory by high-spirited under-
graduates.)

  
 

 
 
 
  

oe ws eed then

At 7:45 a.m. he arrived on campus, lit a Marlboro, and
climbed the bell tower to remove his secretary who had been
placed there during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.

At 8 a.m. he reached his office, lit a Marlboro, and met with
Derther Sigafoos, editor of the student newspaper. Young
Sigafoos had been writing a series of editorials urging the
United States to annex Canada. When his editorials had evoked
no response, he had taken matters into his own hands. Accom-
panied by his sports editor and two copy readers, he had gone
over the border and conquered Manitoba. With great patience
and several excellent Marlboro Cigarettes, the Dean persuaded
young Sigafoos to give Manitoba back. Young Sigafoos, how-
ever, insisted on keeping Winnipeg.

At 9 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with Erwin J.
Bender, president of the local Sigma Chi chapter, who came to
report that the Deke house had been put on top of the Sigma
Chi house during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.

At 10 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and went to umpire an
intramural softball game on the roof of the law school where the
campus baseball diamond had been placed during the night by
high-spirited undergraduates.

At 12 noon the Dean had a luncheon meeting with the presi-
dent of the university, the bursar, the registrar, and the chair-
man of the English department at the bottom of the campus
swimming pool where the faculty dining room had been placed
during the night by high-spirited undergraduates. Marlboros
were passed after lunch, but not lit owing to the dampness.

At 2 p.m., back in his office, the Dean lit a Marlboro and
received the Canadian minister of war who said that unless

young Sigafoos gave back Winnipeg, Canada would march.
Young Sigafoos was summoned and agreed to give back Winni-
peg if he could have Saskatoon. The Canadian minister of war
at first refused, but finally agreed after young Sigafoos placed
him on the roof of the mining and metallurgy building.

At 3 p.m, the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with a delegation
from the student council who came to present him with a set
of matched luggage in honor of his fifty years’ service as dean
of students. The Dean promptly packed the luggage with his
clothing and Marlboros and fled to Utica, New York, where he

is now in the aluminum siding game. © 1061 Max Shulman

To the dean of students and all you other hard-working
academic types, here’s the new word in smoking pleasure
from the makers of Marlboro—king-size unfiltered Philip
Morris Commander. Welcome aboard!
