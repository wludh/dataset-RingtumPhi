Bridewell Is
Dance Board
Executive

By PHIL FARNSWORTH
Associate Editor

Bob Bridewell, a rising jun-

ior from Tyler, Texas, was

elected Friday as vice-president

of Washington and Lee’s

Dance Board for 1961-1962.

Bridewell, an SAE, is news editor
of the Friday edition of the Ring-
tum Phi for next year. He was news
editor of the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
this year.

As new vice-president, Bridewell
will serve as assistant business man-
ager under Dance Board President
Steve Galef, a ZBT rising senior from
White Plains, N. Y., and in 1962-1963
Bridewell will automatically become
president.

In commenting on next year’s
Dance Board, Steve Galef said: “I
am very happy with the Dance
Board’s selection of Bob Bridewell,
and I am sure we will work well
together.

“I am planning changes to improve
the Dance Sets for next year, and the
Dance Board will release some of
these changes in the immediate fu-
ture. One of the changes will be the
elimination of the second dance at
Openings, which will leave only
Fancy Dress with two dances. Also
I intend to place more emphasis

BOB BRIDEWELL
Dance Board Vice-President

on the concerts in the coming year’s
Dance Sets.”

The Dance Board plans to have
a 1961-1962 budget of $20,000. The
Dance Board is made up of the class
presidents, the dance set presidents,
and the president and vice-president
of the student body.

Bridewell was selected from six
applicants by an interviewing com-
mittee consisting of Uncas McThenia,
Jimmy Vann, Steve Galef, Warren
Goodwyn, Dr. Cook, and Dr. Phillips.

Bob Doenges, a Sigma Chi junior,
was elected president of the Inter-
fraternity Council for the coming
year, at an IFC meeting last night.
Si Painter, a PiKA junior, was elect-
ed vice-president; Bil Young, a DU
junior, secretary; and Tony Schle-
singer, a ZBT sophomore, treasurer.

Painter will be IFC rush chairman
next year and Dave Swann, a Phi
Delt sophomore, will edit the rush
booklet.

Doenges has been a representative
to the council for three years. He
is a member of SWMSFC, and has
been a house officer. He has been on
the basketball and tennis teams.

Doenges has called for an assess-
ment of the present Help Week sit-
uation and wants to take some defi-
nite action on new proposals in that
area, it was pointed out in a nom-
inating speech. He has also pro-
posed to use studies of fraternity
organizations at other schools in
selecting improvements in the status
and role of fraternities at Washing-
ton and Lee.

He said that he was highly honored
to be elected president of the coun-
cil and that he would do every thing
in his power to make the IFC a

 

strong and effective body in student
affairs.

In addition to these programs he
feels that it would be a definite
aid to the fraternities if there were
outside speakers brought to the cam-
pus and the houses to speak on
different aspects of the fraternity
system as a whole.

Other business which was discuss-
ed in last night’s meeting was the
choosing of an outstanding rising
senior for the IFC Senior scholar-
ship and the selection of a fresh-
man for the IFC Outstanding Fresh-

Bob Doenges Elected 1961-62 IFC President;

man Award. The announcements will
be made next Tuesday.

Doenges is from Bartelsville, Okla.,
and Painter is from Staunton, Va.
The new secretary comes from Leb-
anon, N. J., while Scheslinger is
from Dallas, Texas. Swann, the edi-
tor of the rush booklet, is from Ashe-
Ville, N. C.

The new president, after being
elected, expressed the IFC’s appre-
ciation to outgoing president Dave
Lefkowitz for the “fine job he has
done this year, and I only hope I
can fill his shoes.”

ROTC Officers

 

Using three of four debaters that
won the state championship in No-
vember of last year, W&L’s debate

| team had its best tournament of the
‘school year over the weekend at
the

Atlantic Coast Conference

 

Inspect VMI

Members of the W&L ROTC Cadet
Corps and Maj. E. J. Roxbury, Jr.,
W&L PMS, were guests of First
Captain Lee Padgett and Lt. Col.
Smith, Commandant, at VMI last
Friday afternoon, for what was orig-
inally planned as a parade review
of the Corps but turned out to be
an in-barracks inspection.

Making the trip with Maj. Rox-
bury were Cadet Col. Nathan P. B.
Simpson, Cadet Lt. Cols. Pete Straub
and John Towler, along with six
company commanders, Cadet Cap-
tains Charlie Day, Clayton Bryan,
Bob Street, Walter Shugart, Charles
Bowie, and Don Pardington.

The trip was in the way of a re-
turn courtesy in that Colonel Smith
and First Captain Padgett were in-
vited to W&L earlier in the year, at
which time only Col. Smith was
able to make the trip to W&L.

Law Frat Elects Officers

Burks Senate of the Delta Theta
Phi Legal Fraternity met last week
and selected their officers for the
1961-62 school year.

Thomas L. Feazell, senior law stu-
dent from Mt. Hope, West Virginia,
was elected president of the organi-
zation and also appointed as the
group’s representative to the Law
School Board of Governors. Robert
B. Armstrong, senior law student
from Valley Stream, N. Y., was
awarded the group’s second highest
office by his selection as Tribune.

Other officers were: Allan Getson,
senior law student from Philadelphia,
Penn., as vice-president, Andrew J.
Russell, intermediate law student
from Louisville, Ky., as secretary,
and Jay F. Wilks, intermediate law
student from Norfolk, Va., as treas-

 

 

urer.

Debate Team ‘Teen 3rd Place
In Atlantic Coast Championship

 

 

Championship at Columbia, South
Carolina. |

Bill Buice and Al Eckes debating
affirmatively captured second place
with a 4-1 record, while Richard
McEnally and Jay Clark on the neg-
ative side did the same with a 3-2
record.

W&L defeated both Virginia and
Duke teams and split with South
Carolina and Wake Forest. The lat-
ter two were the only schools to
finish ahead of W&L in the tourna-
ment. The Conference unanimously
invited W&L to again attend the
tournament to be held at Duke
during the 1961-62 school year.
Never are more than one or two
teams invited to this round-robin
competition.

The South Carolina trip closed the
season for the debate team—a season
in which W&L won the state cham-
pionship, won seven _ individual
awards, won two team awards, and
had three undefeated teams.

In all, the University took part
in eight debate tournaments, one dis-
cussion conference and three prac-
tice debates with other schools.

Thirty-one Washington and Lee
men took part in these activities.

 

Post Office On DST;
No Hunting for Addressees

The Lexington post office will
keep its same hours under Daylight
Saving Time. All pick-ups and de-
liveries of mail, however, will be an
hour later than the usual time.

The morning mail will not be
ready until 9:30 a.m. DST, instead
of the usual 8:30.

Postmaster R. M. Cummings has
notified townspeople and_ students
that the post office staff cannot con-
tinue to deliver improperly addressed
mail. Obsolete addresses, and ad-
resses which do not specify a place
delivery, will be returned to the
sender.

Mr. Cummings explained _ that,
although the local staff has been
lenient in the past, a new govern-
mental policy, will prohibit the
“chasing-down” of addressees. He

   

 

asked people to notify their corres-
pondents of their correct addresses.

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi—
A Non-Biased Newspaper

Although one of the main functions of any newspaper is
to present an editorial opinion, it should be remembered that
it is also one of the purposes of any publication to carefully
weigh and analyze all the facets of an issue before stating the
opinion.

We, of the staff of the Tuesday Edition of the Ring-tum
Phi, wish to express that we will do this, and that our opinions
will not be based on political bias or personal bias.

 

We pledge to you, our readers, that every issue that comes
before the Tuesday Edition’s Editorial Board will (1) be
carefully considered from all points of view and that (2) our
opinions will be expressed in our editorials only and not in the
columns of news found throughout the newspaper.

We, the editors-elect of the Ring-tum Phi, have been
charged that we are heads of newspapers that have been used
for political purposes, and that the Ring-tum Phi will continue
to be used for political purposes. We have been charged with
the above accusation before either of us has published his first
edition.

CHARGES LABELED “HOT AIR”

Speaking for the Tuesday Edition, we conclude that this
charge is not justified and is so much “hot air.”

We further pledge that our opinions will be justly formu-
lated and that we will express our own opinion—whether it be
to the favor of the University Party or to the favor of the Inde-
pendent Party. This is our inherent right and our obligation.

The charges that the Publications Board has been playing
politics for many years and that the Board played politics again
this year, in our opinion, are entirely unjustified and are un-
founded.

We say this because three of the four Independents who
appeared for positions before the Board were appointed to
offices, and because two members of the Washington and Lee
University faculty sit on the Publications Board, each with a
vote. We sincerely think that it is a blow to this University to
charge its faculty, since they are represented on the Board, with
“playing politics.”

Elsewhere on this page their appears a letter from George
Honts, managing editor of this year’s Friday Ring-tum Phi.
He was one of the candidates for editorships of the newspaper.
In his letter Honts says:

“Although admittedly disappointed at not winning
an editorship I do not feel party politics was the decid-
ing factor in the election.”

“There were six candidates interviewed—two were
there for experience and three of us were about equally
qualified—had someone other than two of the three
qualified candidates been chosen there would have been
room for criticism.”

“I offer three facts to support my argument that the
elections were not politically rigged. (1)of four Inde-
pendent Party members interviewed, three were chosen
because of their qualifications; (2) certain members of
the University Party on the Board supported Indepen-
dent candidates they had political reasons to oppose;
(3) the faculty members of the Board, who are not
prejudiced, said, I am told, that it was a non-biased and
fair election.”

Speaking for the new staff of the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi,
I, as editor-elect, wish to urge all persons, regardless of party,
to write letters to the editor expressing your opinions. If you,
as our readers, feel we are wrong concerning an issue, then tell
us, and please don’t hesitate to be frank. We are in this busi-
ness to give the news first, and second to present opinions that
we feel are justified and well founded. You, our readers, should
express your opinions also. Our very foundation of the free-
dom of the press concept hinges on this phrase—the free ex-
change of ideas.

SHOULD PARTIES FORM POLITICAL PAPERS?

The solution proposed by our criticizers is that the In-
dependent Party form a political paper of its own. The Inde-
pendent Party, as well as the University Party, has every right
to form their own publication, and we would respect any such
publication at its face value, regardless of what political flag it
happened to be waving.

If the leaders and members of the Independent Party feel
it is necessary to form a paper to oppose the so-called “Uni-
versity Party-controlled Ring-tum Phi,” then let them meet
and so decide. It is our opinion that the majority of the party
will not be in favor of such a move.

We do not feel that it will be necessary to form such a
paper, in view of our pledges to our readers, and we do not feel
that such a paper will serve any concrete or constructive pur-
pose. We do emphasize, however, that if the leaders and mem-
bers of the Independent Party feel it necessary to make this
move, they have every right to do so, and the Tuesday Staff
will not stand in its way.

If each of you will do this—express your opinions and be

 

Work Begins On Science Building

By STEVE GUILD

For the next year and a half the
students at Washington and Lee will
hear bulldozers roaring, hammers
banging, and riveting of steel—part
of the projects started last week,
the new science buildings and the
new freshman dormitory.

Scheduled for completion in the
fall of 1962, the science buildings
will house enlarged facilities for
physics, chemistry, biology and geol-
ogy departments and the new dorm
will take care of freshman over-
flow which has spread to Preston
House and private homes in the past
few years.

The first stage of both buildings,
the excavation of the building site,
is ahead of schedule and should be
completed by the time school is
over. All that really remains to be
done in this phase is the drilling out
of bedrock. This should come around
examination time (much to the dis-
tress of the law students) but pro-
visions have been made for moving
the exams to different locations if
the noise should become unbearable.

Related to the building program
and a certainty to come is the high
fence which has been constructed
in the past few days. While it may

 

seem that a lower fence would serve
the safety purpose just as well, the
contractors promise that the tradi-
tional peep holes for the sidewalk
superintendents will be drilled in
the wall.

A fairly obvious problem which
has resulted from the new con-
struction is the student and faculty
parking.

The through roads which were
formerly in service have been block-
ed off and after the science buildings
have been completed sidewalks will
be laid in the area. As a result there
will be no more through traffic.
There will be, however, an increase
in the number of parking spaces
available to the students and facul-
ty, for work has started on a park-
ing area in back of Doremus Gym
which will hold an additional 95
cars when it is finished, and have
exits on Washington Street.

The new dormitory which will
connect with Baker Dormitory will
be entirely for the freshmen and
will alleviate the crowded conditions
wheih now exist in the present
Freshman Dormitory. It is also hoped
that the medical facilities and space
can be improved with the new dorm.

Besides the obvious improvements

 

which will come with the new
science buildings, there will also be
the opportunity to offer a number
of new courses because of improved
facilities, new equipment and rooms.
One of the courses in the chemistry
department will be instrumental
analysis, which will be used in con-
nection with the quantitative analy-
sis course.

The biology department hopes to
offer histology (the study of the
tissues of the body), ecology, and
certain work in radioactive biological
studies. There will also be facilities
for individual student research work.

All of this will be the final result
of the long years of planning re-
quired before the “big hole back
of Tucker” could start to be dug.

Fence Hampers Freedom
Of Watchin g Construction

By DAVE KNIGHT
Tuesday Columnist

Here at W&L, as evidenced by
the recent elections, we are all in-
terested in change
and reform. At the
same time, we are
interested in see-
ing how __ this
. change and reform
is being carried
- out. However, one
item seems. to
have slipped the
minds of both po-
litical parties, as
well as the admin-
istration. This is
the fact that a fence of secrecy, both
material and mental, is going up
around the new science building be-
ing built on the campus.

The fence I refer to is the one
which prevents sidewalk superin-
tendents from engaging in one of
America’s favorite pastimes—the
right to offer professional advice
concerning the construction of a
building while still maintaining
amateur standing.

Lost is the feeling of satisfaction
that one derives from knowing that
without this help this new building
could not have been completed. In-
stead, when our new science build-
ing is open to inspection the student
is going to view it with the
suspicion that it is another wicked
device of the feculty to enlarge the
educational facilities of the univer-
sity.

At this opening, the Administra-
tion will be faced with a barrage of
embarrassing questions concerning
student suggestions for (1) a large
recreational area (i.., room for
slot machines, roulette wheels and
other harmless means of entertain-
ment) and (2) the need for mixed-
drink machines.

The reason for all this future
embarrassment and discontent? A
subpugation of our rights as inves-
tors to watch the growth of our in-
vestment. Not only has the Adminis-

Letter to the Editor

Publications
Elections Were
Fair—Honts

Roy Goodwin, editor-elect
Ring-tum Phi
Dear Roy:

While Tony Gray’s Protest article
on the recent Publications Board
election was well intended, I feel
I must take it to task. Although ad-
mittedly disappointed at not winning
an editorship, I do not feel party
politics was the deciding factor in
the election.

There were six candidates inter-
viewed—two were there for exper-

 

ience and three of us were about |
equally qualified—had some other | ~

than two of the three qualified can-
didates been chosen there would
have been room for criticism.

I offer three facts to support my
argument that the elections were
not politically rigged. 1) of four In-
dependent Party members _inter-
viewed, three were chosen because
of their qualifications; 2) certain
members of the University Party
on the Board supported Independent
candidates they had political reasons
to oppose; 3)the faculty members of
the Board, who are not prejudiced,
said, I am told, that it was a non-
biased and fair election.

Being editor of any reliable news-
paper is no bed of roses you will
find, and it is not fair to you to be
under fire before you have had a
chance to prove yourselves. There is
no reason why the student body
should not have confidence in you
and Bill Roberts—if you do not live
up to your responsibility as a jour-
nalist, then we should criticize you.
There is no reason why the student
body should not support your efforts.

Best of luck,
GEORGE HONTS
Managing Editor

Man of Destiny” sixty-five years ago,
is noted as the creator of people who
snap out their words rapidly.

Actually, Shaw’s characters are
only puppets to voice his ideas.
Using “myself” as the measure of
his plays Shaw drew topsy-turvy
pictures of historic characters. Shaw,
said, “I have no clue to any per-
sonage save that part of him which
is myself. I respect historical char-
acters as saying the things they
would have said if they had known
what they were doing.”

The “myself” in Shaw’s characters
makes the acting of any G. B. S. role
difficult. Explaining often in great
detail the characters and ideas of his
plays, he leaves the actor little
room for individual interpretation.
Either the actor plays the part
Shaw’s way or he dosen’t.

Most of the time the Troubadours
are acting “The Man of Destiny”
Shaw’s way. The light quality of
Shavian wit is lacking only once
in one of the two dialogue sequences.
Here the three supposedly quick
witted characters hesitate and strive
too hard for humor. On the whole,
however, control of the Shavian
rythmn is good. Yet timing and pace
could be faster.

All of the characterizations are
brilliant. Tim Morton is an attrac-
tive and very believable Napoleon.
His masterful use of grunts and long
strides properly express the feelings
of a pettish vain little man with the
temper of a young child.

Miss Josephine Unger is a mys-
terious and charming Strange Lady.
Her sparkling eyes and soft voice

 

leave the audience no doubt that
she has bewitched Napoleon and the
Lieutenant.

John Dunnell’s proud peacocking
and twitching of mustache provides
the right comic effect. As the fat
solid Italian inkeeper, Andy Adelson
acts well. Andy always maintains
the required attitude of respectful
reverence in Napoleon’s presence.

“A Marriage Proposal” is the les-
ser work of a great mind. In the
Troubadour production, this ex-
tremely silly farce prepares the way
for the more important Shaw play.
Throughout the short length of the
play a fair amount of spirit and life
exists.

The pleasure Dr. Keith Shilling-
ton takes in portraying buffons is
evident in his performance of the
elderly, pompous Stephan Stepano-
vitch Chubukov. His well timed
movements and pleasantly modu-
lated voice make it hard to be-
lieve that he is not an actor with
professional training.

The marriage seeking daughter is
quite effectively portrayed by Miss
Julia Coates. Controlling her hys-
terics so that they do not become
unpleasant screams, Miss Coates
shows understanding of the prin-
ciple of not overacting. Her suitor,
Mac McClung, appears a never-
ous hypochondriac. His  gyra-
tions adequately give the impression
of a distraught person.

Campus Is Not Apathetic,
It’s Just Contented With Ways

By GEORGE HONTS

For weeks now we have been
fighting Apathy. It became such a
. realistic foe I
' almost visualize
its human charac-
teristics. Indeed,
“@ Apathy came to
have a few friends
on this campus as
did Adolph Eich-
man in other
quarters. And
now, since we
have defeated Ap-
athy, or at least
beaten it into the
ground, I thought it would be well
for us to know what we have been
battling.

The only available source is itself
apathetic—Webster’s dictionary. If
defines apathy as: 1) Want of feel-
ing; lack of passion, emotion, or ex-
citement, and 2) Indifference to what
appeals to feelings or interest. May-
be this campus has been apathetic,
but this is not exactly the definition
I expected. I looked for something
like “contentment” to be used in de-
fining the word.

Certainly I think contentment is a
better word. For years now the
dominant party on campus has been
content to win and the minority
party to lose. There hasn’t been a
lack of emotion over the situation;
both sides cursed their fate and
went about their business. Only two
losers that I know of thought of
switching sides—and that’s content-
ment, not apathy.

And if apathy means lack of po-
litical emotion, then to fight it on
the local campus is to swat files
while rattlesnakes coil. Pity poor
Gov. Barron of West Virginia who

 

Honts

 

blew his top when the crowd which
gathered to hear him was disrespect-
ful to the flag during the Pledge of
Allegence. If we are apathetic we
earned the right to be so by copying
our parents. If we are to change our
ways and become whatever the op-
posite of apathetic is, I say we are
too late. What is it the Jesuits said—
Give me the child and I will make
the man.
* ca *

If you want to emit a few apa-
thetic laughs take the evening off
and double flick. There are two
well-done satires showing at Lexing-
ton’s two palaces of amusement,
Walt Disney outdid himself with
“101 Dalamations” and the “Carry-
on Nurse” people get in some good
digs at society in “Please Turn-
Over.” Sunday I even saw Side and
Daves exchanging tickets.

* * *

I understand the Troub players
are working on a pair of comedies
to round out their very successful
season. It is a shame they don’t
have a decent place in which to do
their work, I am sure many fellow
students agree that the new science
building is long overdue, and a new
auditorium should be next on the
agenda. As a matter of fact, we need
an auditorium more than we need
a new dormitory. Not only are the
Troubs hampered, it is embarrassing
to bring Harry Truman, Barry Gold-
water and Ahmad Jamal down here
and put them in the gym.

* * *

There’s one good thing about the
construction though. A friend of
mine says he doesn’t have any
trouble staying awake in his classes
now.

VMI FIRST, W&L PLACES SIXTH IN STATE

 

Hickey Wins 100; Essex, Meyers Take Seconds

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Managing Editor

Jim Hickey proved for once and
for all that he is the king of Vir-
ginia dashmen Saturday as he cap-
tured the 100-yard dash in the state
track meet at Lynchburg.

There was never any doubt over
the outcome of the race as the
“South Boston speedster” grabbed
the lead as soon as the talented
field left the blocks.

 

Finishing behind Hickey were
W&M’s Dale Bickart, Lynchburg’s
Bob Hopkins, VPI’s Bill Hardwick,
and Randolph-Macon’s Al Kritzer.

Hickey’s first, Skip Essex’s sec-
ond in the 880, and Ed Meyers’ tie
for second in the pole vault placed
the Generals in six place in the
second annual meet. W&L had
15 1/4 points,

VMI finished first with 56 points
followed by Virginia 42 1/2; Wil-

 

liam and Mary 42; VPI 38; Norfolk
William and Mary 28 3/4; W&L
15 1/4; Richmond 7; Lynchburg 6;
Randolph-Macon 4 3/4; Hampden-
Sydney; Roanoke; and Bridgewater.

The Generals looked well indeed
as they doubled their 1960 point out-
put in the state meet. In all the
Generals beat one Big Five school—
Richmond—and seven of the Little
Eight schools.

Freshman Essex was the surprise

 

Varsity Tennis Team Splits;
Beat H-S, Lose To UVa., 9-0

The W&L tennis team split their
last two matches, beating Hampden-
Sydney 6-3 Saturday and losing
to UVa. 9-0 yesterday.

 

John Baker returns ball in
Hampden-Sydney match.

The Wahoos overwhelmed the
hapless Generals in both singles and
doubles on the Washington and Lee

 

 

courts Monday. Jerry Wilbourn, at
No. 5 singles, was the only W&L
player able to take a set from our
powerful neighbors to the north.

Captain Billy McWilliams, veteran
No. 1 single player, started well but
dropped a 7-5, 6-0 decision to Dave
Dickinson.

John Baker, playing No. 2, bowed
to Bruce Farrell of Virginia, 6-1, 6-0.
Clark Valentiner was also downed in
straight sets, 6-2, 6-4.

UVa. clinched the match by win-
ning the No. 4 and No. 6 singles
matches, as Jim Mell and John Mills
bowed to their opponents.

Jerry Wilbourn, in the longest
match of the day, lost his first set
to Ronald Young 6-4, came back to
win the second, 7-5, but dropped the
deciding set 6-2.

Dickinson and Farrell teamed up
to win the first doubles match, beat-
ing McWilliams and Baker 6-2, 6-3.

‘|The Wahoos continued their string

as Young and Killebrow dumped
Valentiner and Mell 6-4, 6-4. Vir-
ginia completed the sweep as Scol-
nic and Klavanas whipped Dick Al-
bert and freshman Bud Hollman
6-2, 7-5. in No. 3 doubles play.

The Generals won their sixth
match of the season last Saturday,
beating the Hampden-Sydney Tigers

 

JV Lacrosse Finishes Season
With 5-4 Win Over Augusta

W&L’s JV lacrosse team closed out
its season yesterday with a 5-4 win
over Augusta Military Academy. Dan
Flournoy won it for the Brigadiers
with a last-minute score.

on defense. W&L goalie Glenn
Thornhill had nine saves for the
contest.

The JV’s thus closed out their

 

6-3 on the W&L courts.

Billy McWilliams, playing his best
match of the season, trimmed
Hampden-Sydney’s Hatcher, 6-2, 6-2
on the slow, rainsoaked courts.

John Baker extended his Hamp-
den-Sydney opponent to three sets,
but lost the match 6-1, 3-6, 6-0.

Clark Valentiner added another
singles victory with a 6-1, 6-2 win
over his H-S opponent, Bud Saun-
ders.

Jim Mell

Jim Mell, at No. 4, had trouble in
the second set, but pulled it out to
win, 6-1, 8-6, over Jim Patton of
H-S.. Jerry Wilbourn also ran into
difficulties in the second set, but
hung on to win, 6-4, 10-8.

Freshman Bud Hollman ,a new-
comer to the top six, won a con-
vineing 6-1, 6-3 victory over the
Tiger’s No. 6 man, Byers.

The five single victories put the
match on ice for the Generals, who
made this their sixth win of the sea-
son.

Hatcher and Kellmeyer

The Tiger twosome of Hatcher and
Kellmeyer proved too strong for
McWilliams and Baker, decision-
ing them 8-6, 6-1. Clark Valentiner
and Jim Mell provided some ex-
citement and good tennis as they
won a hard-fought battle against
Patton and Saunders, 9-7, 4-6, 6-4.
W&L defaulted the last doubles
match.

Going into their final game against
Randolph-Macon today, the Gen-
erals were six and five on the season.

of the meet. The speedster from | misses for the Generals. Eight times

Columbus, Ohio, grabbed a second
in the 880 behind state champ Lar-
ry Williams of VMI.

In finishing second, Essex broke
the two-minute barrier with a
1:59.4. Williams’ winning time was
1:56.6.

Meyers and Jim Parker, W&L’s
one-two punch in the pole vault,
both grabbed medals. Myers ended in
a three-way tie for second with 12-0,
and Parker finished in four-way
tie for fifth with 11-6. Virginia’s
Martin took first with 12-6.

Ed Croft displayed top form in the
low hurdles as he brought home a
fourth place with a 0:26.4. Norfolk’s
Bill James won the event in 0:25.0.

Jumper Robin Kell brought
home the Generals’ final point with
a fifth in the hop-step-jump. Kell
jumped 40-6 1/2 in the trials, but
hurt his ankle and was not able to
reach his usual 42-foot mark.

The meet was a story of near

 

the Generals nearly placed, but each
time they did not quite make it.

Henry Sackett was sixth in the
hop-step-jump by four inches. Kell
was sixth in the high jump by an
inch and sixth in the broad jump
by three-quarters of an inch. Dave
Munroe finished sixth in the shot
put by six inches. Ken Kowalski
placed seventh in the javelin by
three inches.

Coach Norm Lord was very
pleased with the team’s showing in
the state meet.

“This is one of our best showings
against this kind of opposition,” he
said, “and I think we will continue
to improve each year.”

Coach Lord is currently trying to
“beef-up” the Generals’ schedule.
Changes might include a triangular
meet with two North State Confer-
ence teams (probably Elon and East
Carolina) and dual meets with Wil-
liam and Mary and Norfolk William
and Mary.

to Washington College of Chester- | that Washington, which plays at

town, Md., by a 14-3 score.
The Generals’ stickmen now have
a 3-7 record.

General midfielder Charlie Gum-
mey scored the first goal of the
game with 28 seconds gone in the
opening period. He ducked his de-
fenseman on a fast break and fired
a long shot past the Washington
goalie.

The Generals weren’t in the game
after the first quarter. They man-
aged to score again in the first, and
once in the second, but the Sho-men
poured in nine goals in the first
half, and added five more in the
second half, holding the Generals
scoreless.

Attackman Skip Rudolph led the
WC scorers with 3 goals, while
Gummey had two for the Generals.

Herb Tinley, W&L goalie, had 17
saves for the contest.

Washington College brought its
season’s record to 6-1. Their one
defeat came at the hands of Navy,
the defending national champions.

Here’s one filter cigarette that’s really different!

The difference is this: Tareyton’s Dual Filter gives you a
unique inner filter of ACTIVATED CHARCOAL, definitely proved to
make the taste of a cigarette mild and smooth. It works together with
a pure white outer filter—to balance the flavor elements in the smoke.

Tareyton delivers—and you enjoy—the best taste of the best tobaccos,
