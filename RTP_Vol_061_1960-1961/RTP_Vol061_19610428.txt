INDEPENDENTS SWEEP 4 BIG-7 POSTS

For Secretary

By GEORGE HONTS
Managing Editor

Andrew “Uncas” McThenia, Ray
Robrecht and Steve Suttle, all In-
dependent Party candidates, swept
into the Student Body offices in
yesterday’s election in the biggest
upset the “Big Clique” has suffered
since it came to power.

In the Dance Set elections, Inde-
pendent’s Dave Montgomery won
Openings while the University Party
captured Fancy Dress, Springs, and
Finals with Bill Ide, Charles McCord
and Jack Vardaman.

In an election which was expected
to be a photo-finish in several races,
the Independent Party—down 125
votes—marshalled 100 per cent of
their voting capacity along with sup-
port from the Law School and the

 

non-fraternity members to unseat
the University Party candidates.

A harried EC began counting bal-
lots in mid-afternoon but did not
finish the tabulation until 9:45 last
night. Four solemn officials stood on
the steps of the Student Union and
announced the results to a cheering
group of Independent Party mem-
bers while disheartened University
Party supporters displayed their dis-
may in various ways. For the first
time in at least three years the
Student Union was packed with
students anxious to hear the results.

McThenia was the first member of
the Independent Party to be elected
student body president since a fellow
Delt and classmate, Arnold Groobey
won in 1957. Since that time only
two members of the Independent
Party have held a Big Seven office.
Corky Briscoe served a term as sec-
retary and Don Partington was elect-

 

ed president of Fancy Dress.

In the hotly contested election, a
record number of student voters
came to the polls. Every Indepen-
dent Party member voted; only four
University Party members did not
vote. And almost 100 per cent of
the Law school and the non-frater-
nity voted.

The results of the election caught
even the Independent Party by sur-
prise. Why? Was it the stimulation
created by the sincere devotion to
ideals by Grayfred Gray and Pro-
test who helped McThenia get the
support of the Independent Party
only last Saturday? Was it last
week’s Ring-tum Phi forum? Was it
the “gravy train” speeches in Thurs-
day’s assembly? Was it a reaction
to the flippant wordage of “Gro-
tesque”? Or was it the attempt of
six candidates to meet the challenge
of an awakening student body? We

 

do not pretend to know.

The proposed constitutional
amendment from the student body
which would permit the amend-
ment of the constitution by a simple
majority of students voting failed
to gather the necessary two-thirds
vote. The EC proposal which would
allow a student on public trial for
an honor system violation to have
professional counsel passed with 819
approval.

Reactions ran strong to the elec-
tion outcome. However, a soon-to-
be-jubliant Bill Johnston, Indepen-
dent Party chairman, commented
before the results were announced,
“the Independent Party has no
gripes. We presented well-qualified
men who deserve to run and to win.”

To the Student Body:

I want to thank you for your sup-
port in yesterday’s election. This

 

past week has been the most excit-
ing one of my life. However, I real-
ize that the excitement will soon be
over, and that the laurels of elec-
tion day soon wither.

My fellow officers and I hope to
establish the groundwork for our
program of the coming year within
the next few weeks. We hope to
call on you for your aid and sug-
gestions.

It is with the highest esteem that
I regard Rosewell Page’s judgment
and ability. I hope and trust that I
may call for his assistance both in
the interim period’ and -the ensuing
year,

As I stated numerous times dur-
ing the campaign I want both to lead
and serve this student body.

Thank you.

Uncas McThenia
President-Elect

 

Building Contracts

Contracts have been awarded to
three Virginia firms for construction
of new science and dormitory fa-
cilities and modifications of the heat-
ing plant at Washington and Lee
University, President Fred C. Cole
said today.

The largest contract was awarded
to John P. Pettyjohn and Co. of
Lynchburg, which will build a new,
four-story building for the depart-
ments of physics and biology and
make modifications and additions to
existing science building for the
departments of chemistry and geolo-
gy. Contract price for the project
is $1,359,836.

W. W. Coffey and Son of Lex-
ington will build a four-story dor-
mitory for 91 students, most of them
freshmen, at a cost of $326,545.

Law School Names Men
To New Moot Court Team

By PETE ALFORD

The 1961 Moot Court Team mem-
bers were announced today by
Joseph M. Spivey, team chairman.

Spivey, a VMI graduate in the
class of 1957, is joined by three other
law students for next fall’s com-
petition. William H. Clark, Jr., a
freshman law student from Rich-
mond, also qualified for the team.

A Cornell graduate in ’59, Richard
L. Rose from Allenhurst, N. J., will
also represent Washington and Lee’s
Law School. The final Moot Court
team position goes to James T. Tate,
a VMI Graduate of 1959.

The four men were chosen by the
results of the Burke Competition.
This is administered each Spring by
the Law School and with these
best performances become members
of the Moot Court Team.

The 1960 brief was labor law, but
the subject and site for next fall’s
competition will not be known until
this summer.

If W&L’s team places first or sec-

ond in the regional, they will go)

 

Company of Richmond will receive
$49,949.72 for installing a new steam
boiler and making other improve-
ments to the University’s existing
heating plant.

All three firms were low bidders
on the respective projects, President
Cole said. Including equipment,
furnishings, and fees, the three pro-
jects will involve an expenditure of
nearly $2,000,000 for the universi-
ty, he added.

Target date for completion of all
construction is August 1, 1962, Presi-
dent Cole said.

The science facilities are a direct
result of a two-year university de-
velopment program which sought
funds from among Washington and
Lee alumni, parents, and other
friends. The new building will re-
lieve generally crowded conditions
in the existing Howe Hall, now hous-
ing chemistry, geology, and biology,
and will provide a new location for
the Department of Physics, now sit-
uated in Reid Hall, a building sche-
duled for rennovation in the future
to accommodate other academic de-
partments, primarily Journalism and
Communications.

The new dormitory will be a self-
liquidating investment, and will
serve the primary purpose of elimi-

iliary dormitories for freshmen,
President Cole said.

Additions to the heating plant will
accommodate the new science build-
ing and also will provide adequate
reserve capability for improvement
of the existing general heating sys-
tem.

 

Sazeracs Select Members

Dave Peters and Dave Knight
have been elected to lead the Sac-
eracs next year. Peters, a Sigma Nu
from Hagerstown, Md., will be pres-
ident and director of the group.
Knight, a Phi Delt from Worcester,
Mass., is the new business manager
and treasurer.

Five new men were invited to join
the Sazeracs following the group’s
recent try-outs. They are: King Mill-
ing, John Winebrenner, John Baker,
Mark Gee, and Dave Streetman.

The Sazeracs will lose five men
at graduation this year: Huntley
Biggs, outgoing president, Billy Mar-
tin, outgoing manager, Hardie Karrh,
Henry Harrell, and Billy Heald. The
other members of the group besides
Knight and Peters are: Jo Tartt,
Eric Wilson, and Bob VanRensselaer.

 

Dr. Robert Dickey To Retire
After 50 Years Teaching Career

A college teaching career that has
spanned a half century will end in
June when Dr. Robert W. Dickey
retires as head of Washington and
Lee University’s Department of
Physics.

Dr. Dickey, who first faced a class
of undergraduates as an assistant
in physics at Washington and Lee
in 1910, will be succeeded as de-
partment head by Dr. Edward F.
Turner, Jr., 41, a former honor stu-
dent of Dr. Dickey’s and a 1950
graduate of the university.

says he is looking forward to a re-

 

tirement of “scientific loafing.” By
that, he says he means pursuing
scientific interests at a lesiurely
pace.

Dr. Dickey’s first degree at Wash-
ington and Lee in 1910 was a BS.
in civil engineering, and although he
went on to a master’s and doctor’s
degrees in physics at Johns Hop-
kins, he admits that he has remained
an engineer at heart.

Dr. Turner is especially enthusias-
tic about accommodations planned
for student research projects under
Washington and Lee’s new Robert

$50,000 Scholarship
Grant Made By Grahams

A bequest of $50,000 has been
received by Washington and Lee
University from the estate of the
late Mrs. Samuel Jordan Graham
of Washington, D.C., President Fred
C. Cole announced today.

Income from the bequest will es-
tablish Judge and Mrs. Samuel Jor-
dan Graham Scholarships for upper-
classmen with outstanding records
in political science, pre-medicine,
and law, President Cole said.

An additional sum of $3,500 was
bequeathed to the university by
Mrs. Graham to provide perpetual
maintenance of the grave of William

Graham on the Washington and Lee}

campus. William Graham, first man
to hold the title of the president
of the institution, was an ancestor
of the late Judge Graham.

Mrs. Graham died December 5,
1959, and is buried in Jackson Me-

 

morial Cemetery in Lexington at the |

Graham family plot. Judge Graham
was a member of the Class of 1876
at Washington and Lee.

700 Students Witness

Candidates

An hour before the polls opened
yesterday morning 700 students
gathered in Doremus Gymnasium
to have one last look at the six
candidates for the Student Body
offices.

Six somewhat tired and haggard
looking candidates spoke for five
minutes each, offering a fresh
view of what they had _ been
expounding for a week and ex-
plaining once again why they were
the best qualified for the of-
fice they sought. The audience,
forewarned by president Frazier to
be orderly, listened intently to each
of the six and registered their re-
spect and/or support with a solemn
round of applause. All the candi-
dates showed signs of the tension
from the hardest fought campaign for
offices in recent years; everyone
agreed, regardless of the outcome,
the race was well run.

Andrew “Uncas” McThenia was
the first candidate to the podium.
Unlike his Monday night speech,
this one was reserved and given in
a manner which betrayed the fact
he had lost his voice twice in the
campaign. McThenia spoke of mixed
emotions—a desire to win and a
desire to serve. He said there were
no instant cures for the problems of
this student generation, and the re-
forms he advocated were goals on
which students should set their
eyes. He again went over the pro-

| posals which brought him to the

attention of the Independent Party
and the student body.

Rosewell Page took a swipe at Mc-
Thenia, saying the University Party
platform was sound and practical
and that their reforms could be
carried through by the student body
without the necessity of getting
faculty and Trustee approval. He

proposed a legislative council which |

would be representative of all the
student body—law students,
parties and the non-fraternity men.
The EC would retain veto power.

both |

 

’ Final Plea

He admitted that the political set-
up bars some students from an ac-
tive role in the government but
such would not be the case with
the legislative council.

Charles Commander echoed the
University Party platform and stated
he believed himself in more touch
with the student body than his op-
ponent. He too said the University
Party’s platform was more rational
than the Independent Party’s. In
referring to the Independent’s pro
posals Commander said the party
was unrealistic, idealistic or had
underestimated the intelligence of
the student body.

Ray Robrecht admitted neither
party had had time to study all
the needed changes, but his EC
experience gave him an advantage
in seeking out new areas of reform.
He pointed to his record to show
he is not out of touch with the stu-
dent temperament, and he reassert-
ed his beliefs.

Steve Suttle quietly reminded his
audience that the platforms and
qualifications were fully _ stated.
Only the voting remained to be done.
He lashed out, in a logical manner,
at the inequality of representation
in the student government. He asked
that the inequality be reduced. He
estimated one-half of the student
body by virtue of their fraternity
affiliation or lack of affiliation was
unrepresented. He pointed out the
fact that the Independent Party
men had earned their right to run
for office. “None of us,” he said,
“were put on the gravy train in
our freshman year.”

Bill Outman, UP candidate for
secretary, said he was well-qualified
to hold the position of “honor and
leadership” which he sought. He
ealled for more communications be-
tween the student body and the
Executive Committee. He said he is
experienced and able to give this
liaison.

Reflections

We wish the victors well. Their mandate is clear and un-
precedented. We hope that their task of service to this uni-
versity will be informed by a sense of dedication to its ideals and
loyalty to its heritage, as well as the currently popular desire to

speed its progress.

These past few days have been charged with a vitality in
student affairs that seems altogether new to Washington and
Lee. Such vitality is manifest in the overwhelming concern of
this student body for its self-government.

It is not, as some might construe, responsible to the rabble-
rousing techniques of one individual. To say that this campus
is so unsophisticated that is could lend itself to bohemian per-
suasion is a gross misstatement. Such influence as Protest—the
organ of the “angry young men’’—may have wielded in yes-
terday’s election or before was negligible as is reflected in the
overwhelming defeat of the amendment it sponsored.

This newspaper has stood with liberal and constructive re-
form, but we do not believe in reform for its own sake, or
for the personal aggrandizement of the reformer—yet such
motives guide the pens of Protest.

The strife, however, is over, and we join in calling for a
unified student sentiment behind our new campus officers.

Letter to the Editor

 

Student Assails Campus Attitude

To the Student Body:

I have been silent long enough! I
must speak. I hope you bask in
glory—hyopcritical fools! A terrible
injustice has been done. You have al-
lowed the intoxicating opiate of re-
form to go directly to your heads
and as a result, democracy has been
served no better than it has in past
years. In half-ignorance, you have
followed the dictates of a few re-
formers, rather than the dictates of
your hearts and so so-called minds.
I am ashamed of Washington and
Lee. Wake up! Rub the dreams our
of your eyes and look what you have
done .

You cried for democracy, for equal
representation—you have given the
big three offices to one party, you
have given three out of seven offices
to one fraternity—this is representa-
tion?

You ask for more student partici-
pation in government—with the elec-
tion of a president and vice-presi-
dent from the law school, you have
elected for yourselves, gentlemen,
five law students (out of twelve EC
positions) to serve on your Execu-
tive Committee, when the law school
makes up one tenth of the student
body—this is more participation in
government?

You cry for better candidates and
here you have committed the most
heinous crime of all. You allowed
yourselves to be talked into elect-
ing a president who has served for
three days rather than three years.
You were mesmerized into ignoring
the importance of experience and
qualification in voting for the office
of President of the student body.

What will the reformers talk you
into next? Shall we abolish the
assimilation committee’s powers off
campus? Shall we abolish the speak-
ing tradition? Then why not take
the next step—the honor system—
let’s destroy that too. In fact, let’s
destroy everything that Washing-
ton and Lee has stood for in the
past because it’s old, it’s not mod-
ern, it promotes apathy.

Ah apathy, what a lovely word
to banter about. What a convenient,
tempting key it has been, opening
wide the barred doors of tradition
and institution. Well, maybe there’s
a reason for apathy, Mr. Gray. May-
be what you call apathy, a more
perceptice observer would call con-
tentment, solidity and pride. Pride
in a system and university which is
built on the foundations of honor,
good taste and reason.

I cannot say that I am proud of
what Washington and Lee did last
night. I feel a deep sense of shame
and pity at her level of intelligence
and common sense. Sour grapes? No,
just rotten ones.

Ireland Is Head Counselor;
Ketcham, Sharp Assistants;
Three Return For 2nd Year

Tim Ireland, a rising intermediate
law student, has been named head
dormitory counselor for 1961-62.
Serving with him will Robert Ket-
cham, Pi Phi law student, and
Phil Sharp, an SAE rising senior,
as assistant head counselors.

The other dormitory counselors
for 1961-62 have also been an-
nounced. Returning counselors from
this year are Rosie Page, SAE ris-
ing senior, and Jerry Hyatt and
Terry Fohs, both rising Delt seniors.
The new counselors are Dan Balfour,
SPE rising junior; Dave Bevans,
rising PiKA junior; Lanny Butler,
rising SAE junior; Meade Christian,
rising Phi Gam junior; Richard
Edwards, rising Phi Kap junior;
Gerald Kestern, a first year law stu-
dent; Dave Montgomery, rising Delt
junior; John Paul, rising Pi Phi in-
termediate law student; Bob Payne,
rising Delt junior; Jim Russ, rising
Phi Psi senior and Ashley Wiltshire,
rising Delt junior.

James Hitch and Gerald Oullette
will be in charge of Baker Dorm
for next year.

Howard Slater, Charles McCord,
Steve Stull and Pete Agelesto have
been named alternate counselors.

In announcing th list of counselors,
Dean Gilliam commented: “The com-
mittee regretted that the limited
number of places prevented the ap-
pointment of a great many competent
candidates. It is the committee’s
hope that a number of such men,
particularly those who will be
juniors next year will apply next
year.”

The end is in sight for the major
problem that has been facing the
Washington and Lee University De-
partment of Journalism and Com-
munications since it was founded
here by Robert E. Lee a little less
than 100 years ago.

One of the relatively few depart-
ments of its type to be fully ac-
credited by the American Council
of Education for Journalism, W&L
is rated in competition with the best
and largest schools of Journalism
throughout the country, but suffers
considerably from lack of space, es-
pecially for many “laboratory”
needs.

The University, however, is cur-
rently holding a $2,000,000 fund rais-
ing campaign to improve present fa-
cilities and for the construction
of new buildings. Approximately
$250,000 of the money to be raised in
this year-long campaign will be used
for the improvement of the journal-
ism facilities.

Many of the 20 journalism courses
offered here have “laboratory”
needs: professional city and wire
rooms; a better radio broadcasting
studio (and eventually television);
photographic darkrooms for class
use; as well as the usual classrooms,
faculty offices, library and adminis-
trative space.

The department of journalism here
was the first college-level instruc-
tion of its type offered anywhere in
the world. In addition to its regular
curriculum the department also con-
ducts certain major external enter-
prises and services to the news-
paper and broadcasting professions.
The Southern Interscholastic Press
Association was founded here in
1925 and an SIPA Convention is held
annually on the W&L campus. The

 

department has also been charged

by the Alfred duPont Awards Foun-
dation with supervision in the tele-
communications field.

For the many-faceted program, the
faculty in journalism does the best
it can with improvised quarters
scattered among three buildings. The
department has a “makeshift” city
room, no audio-visual room for the
course which make large use of films
and slides, only partial broadcast-
ing facilities, not enough offices for
the faculty, and a lack of storage
space.

The journalism side of the ex-
pansion plans calls for a remodeling
of the present Reid Hall for both
journalism and _ pre-engineering.
This is to be a complete rebuilding
of the interior for the sake of more
flexible arrangement of rooms and

elimination of the present wasted | |

space in the middle of the building.
The ground floor will be devoted
largely to the Journalism Laboratory
Press, while the upper floors will
contain a regular newspaper city
room and wire room, broadcasting
room, photographic darkrooms, as
well as conventional classrooms and
offices.

O. W. Riegel, head of the depart-
ment since 1930, envisions the pro-
ject as a “communications arts”
building bringing under one roof the
following activities and facilities:

1) Classrooms and offices for basic
instruction and research programs
related to the mass media, public
opinion and advertising.

2) Auxiliary professional facili-
ties, including news, printing, adver-
tising and film laboratories, wire
room, radio and television studios
and photographic darkrooms.

3) Accommodations for profes-
sional seminars.

6) Offices for student publications,
such as the Southern Collegian, The

Plans for the improvement cam-
paign call for construction to get
underway upon the completion of
new dormitory and science facilities
which are scheduled to be open the
beginning of the 1962-63 school year.

By VICTOR LASSETER
Friday Columnist

This week’s student-body election
without a doubt constitutes a verit-
able revolution in
our campus politi-
cal system. This
column is written
before the results
of the elections are
known, but that
is not important.
The important
thing is that, for
the first time in
years (perhaps for
the first time in
the history of the
school) candidates ran on meaning-
ful platforms rather than merely on
a long list of extra-curricular ac-
tivities.

It should be pointed out that the
credit for this change does not go
to the so-called student leaders. The
fact that we have had an election
based upon significant issues is due
more to the efforts of Grayfred Gray
and his Protest than to the soul-
searching efforts of the party in
power to improve the Washington
and Lee student government. It was
Gray who began questioning the
present mechanics of the honor sys-
tem, and it was largely through
Gray’s persistent questioning that
we had any issues at all in this
campaign. Proof? At the forum
sponsored last week by the Ring-
tum Phi most of the candidates
turned away in horror when a stu-
dent asked “What will you do to
make Washington and Lee a better
university?”

Despite the fact that platforms
were almost forced upon the can-
didates and had to be hastily
drawn up, the fact remains that
both parties offered some solutions
to problems which had never be-
fore been faced by our “leaders.”

We have been plagued by an hon-
or system whose workings seemed
at times to be as mysterious as those
of the NKVD, with a tradition of
conventional dress which was neither
enforced nor rejected, and with a
system of government often com-
pletely out of touch with the needs
of the student body. The adoption | 399
of party platforms indicates a radi-
cal change in our conception of
leadership. Student body leaders are
no longer expected to follow (as
some candidates suggested), but to
take the initiative in pointing out
faults in our present system of
government and to offer solid pro-
posals to amend these faults.

These elections have been a
valuable, albeit a sudden lesson
for the future. Above all, they
have shown that a majority of stu-
dents are no longer content with
leaders who would fail to take a

dents are invited to participate.

stand on significant issues when

 

the solution of these issues is of
the greatest importance to the
welfare of the entire university.

With this, the elections have
shown that we want leaders, not
figure-heads, and that election to an
office is not to be regarded as an
inherent right of the spoils system
but as an award for capability and
intellectual insight.

This is too valuable a lesson to

 

Platforms Are Now Election Criteria;

Credit Should Ge To Grayfred Gray

be forgotten. If, for example, we
should succeed in placing the honor
system upon a surer foundation,
there is no reason to abandon our
new conception of significant politi-
cal competition and to revert to the
old oligarchic spoils system. Even if
Washington and Lee were a Utopia
among universities we would still
need active student government, for
where there is inactivity there is
stagnation and, again, oligarchy.

 

RES IPSA LOQUITUR

 

By THORNS CRAVEN
Friday Columnist

This week has really put a
columnist in a very precarious po-
sition. All the
shouting is over
on Thursday, I
have to write be-
fore Thursday is
half over, and you
don’t get to read
a word until Fri-
day is almost gone.
Since DST doesn’t
come swinging in

until the SIPA
girls go home, no-
esata body stands to

win and/or lose until next week.

This, however, doesn’t mean that
there won’t be some winners and
some losers running around before
the week is over. To the contrary,
for if the wheels of justice are set
in motion with the expediency that
has been promised, we can expect
three notices of optional departure
by the time the clock speeds up.

forms which have been flying about
for the past week. If any of these
charges had weight of evidence be-
hind them then I expect that by
now the party in power is meeting
to see what to do with the parties
not in power. If all this stealing
really went on then surely some-
one must have seen some of this
political dirtywork going on.

The trial could go something like
this:

“Mr. Losing-candidate, you are
accused of a breach of the honor
system involving stealing.”

(Accused blushes, asks for elab-
oration.)

“We'll hint around for a while,
Mr. Accused, but just as a matter
of policy we can’t reveal the charge
until you ask for a trial. We can’t
just throw our advantage out the
window like that, old man. You
should know that by now. If we
told you what you did then you
might get away without a mark
on your record. By the way, would
you sign this receipt for your per-
sonal belongings.”

(Accused says defiantly: “O.K.”)

Some time passes, as accused sits
in cell with all his old campaign
posters to remind him of his past
glory. A slick psychological man-
uever. Then, in his sweeping robes
and flowing wig, out comes the
chief justice, who says softly:

“Sorry, old man, 2 to 1 in there.
You'll have to check out. Unless,
heh-heh, you want a scandal and all
that. Then you can go to trial. You
realize, of course, that if you do
take the trial the student body will
be offended if you don’t turn over
the gate receipts to SWMSFC.”

(Accused, mumbling, says, “Well,
now that it’s over, since I don’t
want to put you guys to the trouble
of a public trial, what did I do?

Editor,
Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:
Upon receiving my copy of the
recent campus publication (now de-
funct, as it really had only one

 

purpose in mind) entitled “Gro-
tesque,” and after reading it care-
fully, I demised that the author
seemed to have an axe to grind;
and he was grinding it on the grind-
stone while it was still buried in
McPhlerb’s head.

I know the author and have known
him for some time. I realize that
he and other of his friends have
been quite upset at the political re-
sults that have come out of our cam-
pus system with regard to elections
in the past, such as Ralph Evan’s
loss a few years ago. He must re-
member that this was in no way a
breakdown of the corrupt political
system, but a breakthrough of the
democratic process that had been
hidden for so many years. This boy,
seeing another possible defeat with
regard to the election of a few days
ago, panicked and decided to use
his poor humor to the furthering of
the University party and the bolster-
ing of his own ego.

Washington and Lee is supposed to
teach a person honesty and integ-
rity, but above all else respect for
his fellow man. After three and one
half years, I would have at least
expected that this boy could draw
a line between what is low and un-
derhanded and what is above board
when it comes to humor. He has
shown himself to be an excellent
comedian. Yet, this was not enough
glory and he, not content with past
well deserved honors, decided to try
his hand at stabbing people in the
back. Perhaps, as Leopold and Loeb,
he was only interested in the kicks.
On the other hand, he could very
well have been worried that the
party system which has stood for
so many years was again on the
verge of giving way to democracy.

I question not the reasons or po-
litical motives for this slurring farce,
rather I question the reason for
“Grotesque,” and why this boy low-
ered himself to even put together
such a piece of trash. This brief re-
gression back to juvenile expres-
sions makes me wonder if he fully
realized exactly what he was doing.
The only answer to this can be
found in flipping a coin; and whether
it comes up heads or tails, the boy
will still not be able to answer it.

Carpenter Stops W&M, 5-1;
Here Tomorrow

Colonials

Roy Carpenter stopped William
and Mary, his old nemesis for the
second time Tuesday, 5-1, on a
neat four-hitter.

Carpenter, who’s pitched in every
game that the Generals have played
against the Indians during his four
years here, chalked up his third
straight win. He struck out nine.

The Generals mustered only four
hits off W&M southpaw Bruce

 

Trackmen
Down Elon,
Lynchburg

Despite the usual cold, rainy
weather, W&L’s trackmen rocked |
around the track Thursday as they |
smashed Elon College, 94 1/3-45 2/3.

The win was the Generals’ second |
of the week, seventh of the season,

 

O'Hara, but they put three of
them together to produce a four
run third inning.

With one out in the Generals’

Uyenoyama,
doubled Martin home. Ned Hobbs

The Braves got their only run in

, the fourth, when third baseman Bob
| Irby hit a solo home run to center
| field. It was Irby who sent the sea-

son’s first contest between the clubs
into extra innings when he homered
off Carpenter in the ninth at Wil-
liamsburg.

| The Generals scored their fifth
run in the bottom of the six. Car-
| penter reached first on a fielder’s
| choice, moved to second on a walk,
|

 

and scored on an error.
Carpenter, who leads the Generals’

=“ mound staff in games won, pushed

and 14th dual meet victory in a row.| Hm

Tuesday they topped Lynchburg

College, 80-42. |

Coach Norm Lord juggled his |
distance men_ switching Mike |
Shank to the 880, Skip Essex to |

the mile, and Mack Brownlee to | §

the 2-mile. Still each came in with |
a first.

Brownlee turned in the day’s best
performance as he beat last year’s
2-mile time by nine seconds with a
10:28.6. This was the first time
Brownlee has run the 2-mile this
year. Essex was first in the mile
with 4:51 and Shank took the 880
with 2:07.5.

Jumper Robin Kell was high scor-
er with eight points. He _ took
first in the high jump at 5-8 and
second in the hop-step-jump at 39-2.

Kell nearly had two firsts, but
Elon’s George Wooten, who had
never done the hop-step-jump
before, passed Kell on his last
jump with 39-7.

W&L swept only one event
Thursday—the pole vault. Jim Park-
er took first at 11-6.

Preston Lancaster ran his fastest
high hurdle race of the season as
he edged Elon’s Ed Burke and
W&L’s Ed Jansen for first. His time
was 0:16.0.

Other winners—Dave Munroe, shot
put, 43-7; Chip Day, discus, 121-3;

Tommy Edwards, broad jump, 20-0; | -

Jim Hickey, 100, 10.1; Dave Britt,
220, 23.6; and Chuck Begg, javelin,
160-8 1/2.

ey

The Generals had their best meet
of the season Tuesday as they whip-
ped Lynchburg College, 80-42, at
Lynchburg.

Last year’s best times and dist-
ances took a beating as 16 marks
were bettered.

Jungle Jim Hickey led the way
as he sped to a new W&L record
in the 100-yard dash with a 0:09.75.
The old record was 0:09.8, set in
1915, and equalled by Hickey twice
this year.

Hickey had a 0:21.3, which tied his
record, in the 220-yard dash, but
placed second to Lynchburg’s Bill
Hopkins.

Freshman Skip Essex came within

his total to 32 innings pitched in six
games. In that span, he’s given up
| 23 hits, including two doubles, a
' triple, and two home runs (both
iby Irby). He has an earned run
| average of 3.09. He’s walked nine,
|an average of one every four in-
| nings, and now leads the staff in
strikeouts with 28.

The Generals next take on George
Washington U., which comes in for
a 2:30 game on Smith Field to-
morrow. Carpenter is expected to
start again for the Generals, who
now have a record of 5-4.

Hickey, Hopkins Duel To Draw

The track duel between W&L’s
Jim Hickey and Lynchburg’s Bill
Hopkins was a draw.

But both runners came out of the
meet with new records.

Hickey sped to a new record in
the 100-yard dash with a 0:09.75.
This bettered the old W&L mark
of 0:09.8, which was set in 1915.

Not to be outdone, Hopkins put
everything he had into the 220. He
edged Hickey by a stride and broke
the Lynchburg record with a 0:21.2
time. Hickey tied the W&L 220
mark, which he set at Wake Forest
in March, with a 0:21.3.

Roberts Is W&L’s First 14-Foot Pole Vaulter;
But He Cannot Compete, He’s A Geology Teacher

It’s been seven years since Wash-
ington and Lee has had a 13-foot
pole vaulter. Now it has one but he
cannot compete in meets.

W&L’s new vaulter is Clarence
Roberts, instructor in the geology
department.

Roberts, from Newport News, at-
tended Newport News High where
he set the state high school record
of 12-10 1/2 in his senior year. His
record was bettered last year by
John McCormick, another Newport
News High vaulter. McCormick has
cleared 13-7 in high school compe-
tition.

Roberts, who is 5-9, 150 pounds,
is one of the country’s top vaulters.
He graduated from the University
of Virginia in 1958. His highest
vault during his four years as a
letterman for Virginia was 13-3.

Roberts vaults regularly in AAU
competition for the Baltimore Olym-
pic Club. Last week he cleared 14-
feet for the first time in a dual meet
with the Quantico Marines.

At W&L, Roberts helps the Gen-
erals’ vaulters. But the practice
seems to have helped Roberts more.

 

“In the last two months I’ve im-
proved more than in the last two
years,” Roberts said.

Vaulting isn’t work to Roberts, it’s
fun. “I can’t consider vaulting work
because I really enjoy it. It’s like a
hobby,” he said.

At 5-9, Roberts is a little short for
for a vaulter, but that doesn’t bother
him.

“There are few small vaulters
around,” he said. “Vaulting is just
what you do with what you have.”

This year Roberts won the South
Atlantic Championship with a 13-6
vault, took first in a dual meet with
Quantico with a 14-0 vault, and tied
for fifth in the Quantico Relays with
a 13-6.

Roberts actually cleared 14-feet
for the first time in a meet in the
Quantico Relays. But after he
cleared the bar, his pole fell into
the pit, making the vault no good.
He cleared 14-feet indoors this win-
ter in practice.

three-tenths of a second of break-
ing two minutes in the 880. His
2:00.3 run bettered last year’s top
mark by three seconds.

In racking up its sixth win of the
year and 13th in a row, W&L
swept four events: the shot put,
discus, high jump, and high hur-
dles.

Robin Kell paced the sweep of
the high jump which saw two W&L
men—Dave Britt and Phil McCaleb—
turn in their highest jumps of the
season. Kell jumped 5-11; Britt,
5-8; and McCaleb, 5-6

Dave Munroe grabbed first in
the shot with a toss of 44-8 3/4 and
third in the discus with 107-4.
George Cruger took second in the
shot with 41-0 and second in the
discus with 119-2.

Chip Day was first in the discus
with a heave of 127-3. Jim Parker
captured first in the pole vault with
12-0. Tommy Edwards jumped 21-7
to take first in the broad jump.

Ed Croft paced the high hurdle
sweep with a 0:15.8. Ed Jansen had
0.16.0 and John Pearson turned in
0:16.4,

“Tron Horse” Mike Shank ran his
best mile and 2-mile times in two
years, but finished second to Lynch-
burg’s Bill Hooper in both races.
Shank had a 4:43.3 in the mile and
10:34.1 in the 2-mile.

John Pearson won the low hurdles
with a 0;25.2. Fox Urquhart placed
second in the 440 with a 0:53.1,

Dr. Robert Dickey To Retire

(Continued from page 1)

search opportunities will make a
great difference in the way in which
the department will be operated in
the future,” Dr. Turner predicts.

In many ways, Dr. Dickey and
Dr. Turner reflect the advance and
expansion of physics as a science
and academic discipline over the
past 50 years. Both men have solid
foundations in general physics, but
Dr. Dickey admits that over the
years his concern has been primarily
in teaching “classical” physics. Dr.
Turner, who came to Washington
and Lee originally to study journal-
ism, is a product of the post-World
War II nuclear age, with graduate
work in nuclear physics and an am-
bition to introduce more in this
area of study at Washington and
Lee. The new building has provisions
for a nuclear laboratory.

Dr. Dickey’s affiliation with Wash-
ington and Lee began in 1906 when
he enrolled as a freshman. A charter
member of the institution’s Phi Beta
Kappa chapter, he served as a stu-
dent instructor while earning BS.,
B.A., and M.A. degrees, and upon
completion of graduate school in
1916, he joined the faculty as an
associate professor.

He helped organize the department
of electrical engineering, and served
as a professor of physics and elec-
trical engineering between 1928 and
1934. When Washington and Lee
abandoned its engineering curricu-
lum, Dr. Dickey became Cyrus Mc-

 

Cormick Professor of Physics, and
in 1947 he became a professor on
the Thomas Ball Foundation.

Looking back, he singles out two
aspects of life at Washington and
Lee that have meant most to him.
“I think I appreciate the student
Honor System more than anything
about Washington and Lee,” he says.
“And the intellectual freedom that
has existed here is another striking
point for which I am grateful.”

He and Mrs. Dickey will retire
from their campus home to a story
and a half Cape Cod-style home that
is in its final stages of construction
here.

“Well, old man, remember that
active, non-apathetic, super-charged
political campaign we had last week.
Lots of fun, by the way, and you
ran a good race. But, back to brass
tacks, as they say: You—to get
down to particulars—implied that I
stole a platform plank. As you knew
of this violation, but didn’t report
it, you’re guilty. Of course, if we
wanted to, we could get you for
stealing a little yourself, but there is
no sense in making this thing em-
barrassing for either of us. So long,
old man, good luck somewhere else.”

(Accused, blushing, exits toward
an apathetic campus somewhere in
the mid-west, saying, “What a Sys-
tem.”)

tucky Foreign Language Conference
in Lexington, Ky., on April 28-29.

Dr. Barritt, a scholar of linguistic
science, will present a paper en-
titled “The Writing of Allophones”
to the linguistic section of the con-
ference.

On May 4-5, Dr. Barritt will at-
tend a conference of linguists in
Washington, D.C., sponsored by the

 

Foreign Service Institute.

  
  
 
  

iMyers To Go To London

Dr. Edward D. Myers will resign
his position as professor and head
of the Department of Philosophy at
Washington and Lee to become cul-
tural attache at the American Em-

| bassy in London, President Fred C.

Cole announced today.

Dr. Myers, 53, will assume his du-
ties in London on July 7. He took
the foreign service officer’s oath in
Washington on April 17.

The new post is the second such
assignment Dr. Myers has held since
1958, when he was granted two
years leave of absence from Wash-
ington and Lee to serve as cultural
attache at the American Embassy
in Bonn, West Germany.

Dr. Myers is a native of Martins-

| ville, and served as dean and pro-

fessor of humanities at Roanoke
College from 1945 to 1949, before
joining the Washington and Lee
faculty. He is a graduate of Roa-
noke College and received his ad-
vanced degrees at Princeton.

An energetic scholar, Dr. Myers
is author of Education in the Per-
spective of History. He also collabo-
rated with noted British historian
Arnold J. Toynbee in the prepara-
tion of a gazetteer volume for use
with Toynbee’s ten-volume master-
work, A Study of History.

Phillips Articles Published

Two digests of articles written by
Dr. Charles F. Phillips, Jr., assist-
ant professor of economics at Wash-
ington and Lee University, have

been published recently, one of
them in Europe.
An article entitled “Collective

Bargaining,” which appeared in the
January, 1961, Issue of Office Execu-
tive, a monthly publication of the
National Office Management Asso-
ciation, was published in The Execu-
tive, a monthly publication of the
Harvard University Graduate School
of Business Administration contain-
ing abstracts of current literature of
