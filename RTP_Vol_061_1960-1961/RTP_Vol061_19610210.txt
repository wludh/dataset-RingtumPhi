. BOARD APPROVES NEW BUILDING PLAN

African Positions
Offered To Seniors

The Teachers College of Columbia
University, in response to a recom-
mendation by the African Liaison
Committee of the American Council
on Education, is now screening pros-
pective 1961 graduates who would be
interested in teaching in East Africa
secondary schools.

A conference was held at Prince-
ton to consider the educational prob-
lems of East Africa-Kenya, Tang-
anyika, Uganda, and Zanzibar. The
conference was sponsored by the
African Liaison Committee of the
American Council of Education. The
participants included representatives
of the governments, education and
voluntary bodies of the territories
concerned, the United Kingdom and
the United States.

In co-operation with Great Britain,
the U.S. is sending 150 young Ameri-
cans to East Africa this year to ease
a drastic shortage in the new na-
tions.

Prospective graduates of Wash-

English Grant
Offered Students

A $750 scholarship for study in
England or Scotland during the sum-
mer of 1961 has been announced by
the Virginia Branch of the English-
Speaking-Union.

James D. Farrar, assistant dean of
students, said today that the schol-
arship will provide an opportunity
for a Virginia college student to take
course in an English or Scottish Uni-
versity and also to travel in Great
Britain in order that they may gain
a better understanding of the Eng-
lish people.

Qualifications for the scholarship
are as follows: a resident of Virginia
in the current sophomore or junior
class of a Virginia college or univer-
sity who has not heretofore visited
the United Kingdom. Applicants must
be between 18 and 22 years old and
must be recommended by his college
or university.

Students interested in applying
for the English-Speaking-Union
award should see Dean Farrar in
Washington Hall 25.

 

 

Plecement Interviews
Announcd By Farrar

Mr. James D. Farrar, placement
director, announced today that the
following interviews had been ar-
ranged for the dates listed:

Monday, Feb. 13

Mr. D. A. Mershon of the Lehigh
Portland Cement Company of Allen-
town, Pa., will visit the campus to
interview seniors interested in op-
portunities for a Sales and Sales
Administrative career with his
company. Men will be accepted
for the training program regardless
of their military status.

Tuesday, Feb. 14

Mr. H. H. Harrison of The State-
Planters Bank of Richmond, Va., will
interview seniors interested in a
career in banking. He will discuss the
numerous opportunities in invest-
ments, branch banking, trusts, opera-
tions, credit, correspondent bank
work, etc.

Thursday, Feb. 16

Mr. R. F. Dolan of the Metropoli-
tan Life Insurance Company will
visit the campus to talk with seniors
interested in his company along the
lines of Home Office administration,
Actuarial ,and Sales positions.

Friday, Feb. 17

A representative of Aetna Casualty
and Surety Company will be on cam-
pus to interview seniors interested
in the opportunities of employment
with his company—along the lines
of salaried Field Representative po-
sitions which lead to positions at
the Sales Management level.

Seniors interested in the above
should make appointments to meet
representatives of these firms at the
Placement Office, 25 Washington Hall.

 

ington and Lee will qualify for
participation as Group B members:
about 50 liberal arts graduates of
the class of ’61 who have a bach-
elor’s degree but no professional
preparation for teaching will re-
ceive a full academic year—nine
months—of orientation training and
teaching practice at Makerere Col-
lege, Uganda, beginning in early
July 1961. Their course will lead
to a diploma in education.

These graduates would then go
into English speaking schools in East
Africa for a period of teaching, with
expenses and a salary of $2,800 or
$3,000 a year.

Director of International Studies at
Columbia has asked for immediate
recommendations. One or two stu-
dents from W&L may be selected.
Any student interested in the pro-
gram or further information should
contact Assistant Dean James Farrar
in Washington Hall 25 immediately.

Dr. Fishwick
Publishes Article
For Journal

The first in a series of articles on
Denmark by Dr. Marshall W. Fish-
wick, professor of American studies
at Washington and Lee University,
has been published in the Fall issue
of the Texas Quarterly of the Uni-
versity of Texas.

The article, entitled “Denmark’s
Double Image,” is the result of Dr.
Fishwick’s Fulbright lectureship in
Denmark during the 1958-59 aca-
demic year.

The other two articles in the series
will be on Soren Kierkegaard and
Hans Christian Andersen. They are
scheduled for publication this spring.

Dr. Fishwick writes in his current
article: “Underneath the surface
gaity is a monumental boredom
which has helped give the Danes one
of the highest suicide rates in the
world. Underneath the lighthearted
manner is one of the shrewdest and
most calculated economies in the
world. What one feels when one
comes to have friends in a Danish
town is not noisy abandon but quiet
desperation. Their culture is ground
in realism, not fantasy.”

The author of several books and
numerous articles for national liter-
ary publications, Dr. Fishwick has
been a member of the Washington
and Lee faculty since 1949. He re-
ceived his A.B. at the University of
Virginia, his M.A. at the University
of Wisconsin and his Ph.D. from
Yale University.

In 1953 and 1955 he went to Eu-
rope as program director for the
Council on Student Travel. As the
result of a lecture series given at
Oxford University, he was made a
member of the British American
Studies Association in 1959.

 

Brockman Receives Grant
For Graduate Research

An instructor in romance languages
at Washington and Lee University is
one of 65 college professors in the
nation granted a Danforth Teacher
Study Grant for the 1961-62 academ-
ic year.

Charles B. Brockmann, 37, has re-
ceived the grant for additional
graduate study at the University of
California in Berkley, according to
an announcement by Dean of the
College William W. Pusey III. He
will study two semesters and two
summers beginning in June.

His current field of research is the
work of the late Albert Camus, a
contemporary French writer.

A member of the Washington and
Lee faculty since 1959, Brockmann
received his A.B. and M.A. degrees
from the University of North Car-
olina in 1949 and 1955 respectively.
Before coming to Washington and
Lee, he was on the faculties of King
College and Lincoln Memorial Uni-
versity.

 

 

Norman Thomas, First of the speakers of International International Re-

lations Week spoke to a capacity crowd in Lee Chapel.

Moos Unable To Appear

‘Russia Wants Peace’
Says Last IRC Speaker

Dr Abraham Kreusler, chairman of
the department of Russian students
at R-MWC, told a W&L audience in
Lee Chapel last night that the East-
West conflict is not an idealogical
one.

Dr. Kreusler said communism
meant nothing to the average Rus-
sian, but the people were beginning
to take pride in their country’s ac-
complishments. Their desire is to
surpass America in military power,
agricultural production, and eco-
nomic strength.

Not War, but Peace

The native of Russia also told the
audience that Russia does not want
war, but peace. Peace is essential, he
said, for Russia to divert more of
her resources to consumer goods—
and there is growing pressure on the
government for these goods.

Dr. Kreusler was the final speak-
er in the three-day International Re-
lations Week that was marred by the
heavy snow fall. Mr. Malcolm Moos
was unable to come to Lexington
for a scheduled speech Wednesday,
but IRC officials said he would ap-
pear at a later date.

America’s leading socialist, Nor-
man Thomas, opened the week Tues-
day evening in Lee Chapel with a
four-point proposal for U.S. foreign
policy.

“A foreign policy,” he said, “that
would make sense must begin by
accepting the fact that war is really
unthinkable and therefore that we
have to find alternatives.”

 

Dr. Whitaker Given Funds

To Continue Research

Dr. Robert D. Whitaker, assistant
professor of chemistry at Washing-
ington and Lee University, has re-
ceived a $4,518 grant from the Re-
search Corporation of New York for
a two-month summer research pro-
ject, Dean William W. Pusey, III,
announced today.

Dr. Whitaker will continue a study
of compounds between iodine-chlor-
ides and amines that was begun last
year under the auspices of Wash-
ington and Lee’s own John M. Glenn
Fund for faculty research.

The Research Corporation said its
award is a “contribution to the aca-
demic and scientific program” at
Washington and Lee.

Assisting Dr. Whitaker will be
John R. Ambrose, of Roselle Park,
N. J., currently a senior chemistry
major at the university.

Approximately half of the stipend
will be used to purchase equipment
necessary for the study, Dr. Whitaker
said. Work on the project will be-
gin July 1.

Dr. Whitaker is a 1954 honor grad-
uate of Washington and Lee, and re-
ceived his graduate degrees at the
University of Florida. He joined the
Washington and Lee faculty in 1959.

 

Mr. Thomas proposed that 1) uni-
versal disarmament, 2) a strengthen-
ed United Nations, 3) a progressive
disengagement from military com-
mitments and 4) a deeper commit-
ment to the struggle against poverty
would set the world on the road to
peace.

The theme of the conference was
“Some Aspects of the East-West con-
flict.” The sessions are designed to
draw attention to the problems of
international relations.

Dr. Kreusler closed his speech,
and the conference, on an optimistic
note. He urged the students in the
audience to rally to the challenge
which Russia has offered, and he
reminded the audience that “this is
a wonderful world.”

 

Constuction To Begin Soon;

Present Facilities To Be Altered

Washington and Lee University’s
Board of Trustees has authorized
the university to proceed with plans
to construct a new science building
intended for use in September, 1962.

The new structure will house the
departments of physics and biology,

British Brigadier Stephen Longrigg
To Speak In duPont Hall Monday

A veteran of 40 years experience
in Near East affairs will speak here
Monday on “Colonialism—Facts and
Fancies.”

Brigadier Stephen Longrigg, who
has been a British army officer, civil
administrator and petroleum com-
pany official, will speak in duPont
Hall at 10:15 a.m. under the auspices
of the Lexington Branch of the
English Speaking Union.

Frances L. McPheeters, speaking
for the English Speaking Union said,
“Brigadier Longrigg is well known
to American audiences as being a
brilliant and articulate speaker. He
knows the situation in the Middle
East from first-hand experience....
He has the facility of making the
complex situation in the Middle East
and Africa understandable and fas-
cinating.”

Veteran of World Wars I and II

A veteran of World Wars I and II,
Brigadier Longrigg began his career
in the Near East as an infantry of-
ficer in Mesopotamia. Later he was
a civil administrator in Iraq. In the
late 1920’s he published his first his-

 

torical work “Four Centuries of
Modern Iraq.”

In 1931, he joined the Iraq Petro-
leum Company and served with
them until 1951, except for the period
of the second World War. During
the early '40’s, Brigadier Longrigg
was governor of various Italian col-
onies in Africa.

Following his retirement, Brigadier
Longrigg has spent much of his time
writing and lecturing. In 1955 Oxford
University conferred a D. Litt. degree
on him. He speaks Arabic, Turkish,
French and Italian.

In U.S. for Third Time

A well-known and popular lectur-
er, Dr. Longrigg has toured the
United States and Canada twice be-
fore under the auspices of British
Information Services. His present
tour, under sponsorship of the Eng-
lish Speaking Union, will take him
to the Southern parts of the United
States.

Monday night, Brigadier Longrigg
will speak at VMI on “Islam and Oil:
Political and Economic Factors in
Today’s World.”

 

W&L Grants 21 Degrees

Washington and Lee University
has granted degrees to 21 men who
fulfilled requirements at the end of
the first semester.

Four bachelor of arts, four bachelor
of science in commerce and 13 bach-
elor of law degrees were awarded
following approval of the candidates’
records by the faculty and the uni-
versity’s board of trustees.

Bachelor of arts degrees were
awarded to T. H. Alexander, New
York City; L. D. Chapman, Pelham,
N. Y.; C. B. Davis, Hampton; and
R. G. Rappel, Worchester, Mass.

Wickliffe Hollingshead, Riverton,
N. J.; W. L. Snowdon, Jr., Wilming-

 

ton, Del.; R. J. Walters, Jr., Mill-
burn, N. J.; and H. W. Zimmerman,
Cincinnati, Ohio; received bachelor
of science degrees in commerce.

LL.B. degrees went to H. C. An-
derson, Lebanon, N. J., H. M. Bates,
Wise; R. J. Berghel, Omaha, Neb.;
T. B. Bryant, III, Orangeburg, S. C.;
W. F. Ford, Toronto, Ontario, Cana-
da; W. C. Foulke, Jr., Yardley, Pa.;
R. L. Gilliam, III, Union City, Tenn.;
and N. A. Lapsley, Lexington.

Also, R. H. Parsons, Pekin, II;
N. H. Rodriguiz, Magnola, Del.;
G. E. Smallwood, Lexington; B. M.
Storick, Brooklyn, N. Y.; and H. V.
White, Jr., Holland, Va.

 

and will relieve generally crowded
conditions in Howe Hall, the present
science building accommodating
chemistry, geology and biology de-
partments .

Howe Hall will undergo remodel-
ing and will receive a new wing of
classrooms, laboratories and an ob-
servatory as a part of the current
building project.

President Fred C. Cole said the
university architects will submit
plans to contractors for bids later
this month, and work is expected
to get underway in early spring.

Culmination of Program

The project marks the culmination
of a two-year University Develop-
ment Program which began in Jan-
uary, 1959, to raise $2,000,00 for im-
proving Washington and Lee’s facil-
ities for science, journalism and pre-
engineering.

A total of 4,038 donors have sub-
scribed more than $2,000,000 orig-
inally sought, President Cole said,
but he added that the fund campaign
is continuing. Approximately $500,-
000 realized through the campaign’s
efforts was designated by donors for
scholarships, faculty salaries and
general endowment, he explained.

Although additional funds are still
needed to equip the new facilities,
President Cole said sufficient funds
are “on hand or in sight” to begin
work.

“The urgency of the need for im-
proved science accommodations has
caused the Trustees to decide to pro-
ceed,” President Cole said. “We are
confident the additional funds will
be available when they are required.”

Growing Interest in Science

President Cole cited a growing
interest and competency on the part
of W&L Students in _ science
and technology. He said Wash-
ington and Lee’s new plans will help
give proper emphasis to scientific
instruction in the university’s lib-
eral arts program and enhance its
program in pre-medical work and
pre-engineering studies.

The university plans to provide
all four scientific departments with
modern instructional laboratories and
classrooms, library and display fa-
cilities, and special facilities, in-
cluding an observatory for physics,
a vivarium and greenhouse for biol-
ogy, a seismology room for geology
and an instrumental analysis lab-
oratory for chemistry.

A special feature in all depart-
ments, President Cole pointed out,
will be separate research labora-
tory accommodations for faculty and
student projects. The Robert E. Lee
Research Fund was established re-
cently at Washington and Lee to
promote faculty-student projects in
all academic departments, includ-
ing the sciences.

Reid Hall To Be Remodeled

When the physics department and
pre-engineering studies vacate the
present Reid Hall, that building will
be available for remodeling and use
for other purposes, principally those
of the Department of Journalism and
Communications, President Cole said.
Reid Hall, built in 1904, is the only
academic building at Washington
and Lee which has not been modern-
ized.

Architects for the new project are
Clark, Nexen, and Owen of Lynch-
burg. They were assisted by repre-
sentatives of the science depart-
ments, chiefily the department heads:
Dr. Robert E. Dickey, physics; Dr.
Kenneth Stevens, biology; Dr. Es-
march S, Gilreath, chemistry; and Dr.
Edward W. Spencer, geology.

 

Notices

Pi Sigma Alpha will meet Tues-
day at 7:30 p.m. on the 3rd floor
of Newcomb Hall. All members are
urged to attend.

The UCA invites students to
meet with them at 10 p.m. on Tues-
days in the Student Union.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
A Modest Proposal (?)

Though we consider the stands that this edition has taken
as predominately liberal in principle, it has not been our mission
to consistently advocate reform, often extreme, for the sole
purpose of agitation or mere sensationalism. We hold our
task more sacred, and we will not cheapen it with “sounding
brass.” We will join, as in the past, in heralding the ‘New
Era,” but because our true allegiance is to this great university
and not to one or several of its complexes—be they administra-
tive or student—our praise will often be checked by caution,
question and possibly negation. In this task, however, we hope
to be a gadfly rather than a mouthpiece, and in our purpose, we
desire to aid in the chartering of a progressive Washington and
Lee.

We recognize the present trend in many areas of university
life to be one characterized by tighter administrative control.
The sound academic policy that such reform is fostering is
indeed more desirable than that of the past. However, along
with the more noticeable effects of this trend, we also recognize
the increasing threat of administrative intervention in those
areas formerly controlled by student will.

This threat is prevalent in the current IFC crisis. We admit
that any such intervention has complete justification either be-
cause of student neglect or abuse of privilege and responsi-
bility, but as a solution it is undesirable. If the administration
intervenes and removes all forms of student representation in
a particular area formerly under their control, then we believe
one of the great strengths of Washington and Lee—that trust
which is placed in the integrity of its student body—will be
undermined.

Rather than mutual exclusion, we recommend greater admin-
istrative and student correlation in those areas which presently
are obstacles to the ultimate progress. By working together,
mindful of one another’s interests, the two elements will achieve
more representative, and thereby, satisfying resolutions.

An organ used effectively by former President Gaines was
a Student Advisory Council which both made recommendations
and considered then current issues with the administration.
Such an advisory board, meeting frequently, could keep abreast
of the contemporary situation, and not only would the student
interest be represented in developments, but also the adminis-
tration would benefit through this healthy interchange of sug-
gestion and criticism.

The students of this university are anticipating change
and are grateful for it, but it is our opinion that they desire to
be a part of that element promoting change—both in allegiance
and in active participation.

We recognize that there are areas, such as in the IFC, in
which the student body has failed to take the necessary initiative
for progress mainly because of the satisfaction with the status
quo. But we propose that the only solution for removing any
deficiency or deterrent to the progress in those areas lies not in
the complete removal of student authority, but in the incorpora-
tion of this authority with a similar faculty-administered influ-
ence which would exert a necessary pressure upon the student
element.

The area, as we have suggested, which gives us current
concern, not only because in it the threat of intervention looms
high, but also because we recognize its failure to impose the
needed control upon the fraternities, is the IFC. The privilege
of this body to exercise such power (granted several years ago)
was not an easy victory for the student body, but such a privi-
lege can be denied with little administrative effort.

If this body can reverse its present trend of indifference and
dismissal, a solution such as we propose will not be necessary.
Its present plight is not responsible to its officers and those
members who have sought conscientiously to effect meaningful
and progressive legislation, but to the fraternities comprising
its membership which cannot bend with progress. But, if the
answer is not with the IFC, then we propose a solution arrived at
by both student and faculty-administrative representation.

The only alternative to a joint decision is direct intervention.
In 1958, a special committee of the administration, established
on a temporary basis, gained prominence by adopting the pres-
ent system of rules regarding combo and house party limitations.
This act flaunted the authority of the IFC, and the student
body accepted such intervention with a shrug of its apathetic
shoulders.

If the efforts of the IFC continue to end in failure, we
recommend that the faculty committee on fraternities, which is
composed of representatives of the administration and the
faculty, be reenforced with adequate student representation
and be re-named the University Committee on Fraternities. We
would further recommend that this committee be empowered
to act in those areas which the IFC cannot. This committee
would not deny the existence of the IFC, but it would merely en-
act legislation which the latter is incapable of passing, and pre-
vent the unilateral adoption of rules by administrative decree.

With the inception of this University Committee on Fra-
ternities a more judicious appraisal of our fraternity system
would be assured. Such areas as hell week abuses, parties and
combos which exceed the boundaries will be well on their way
to abolition, rather than stagnation in the drone IFC.

Our plea, in good faith, is for more student representation
in the determining of university policy. The act two years ago to
add a student representative to the powerful Administrative
Committee was a step in this direction. We would challenge the
student body, in particular the IFC, to meet its responsibility.
Where this is impossible, however, we would emphasize the
necessary advantages of joint participation in lieu of interven-
tion.

 

Prof. Latture Among ODK Founders;
Thursday Marks His 46th Ceremony

A soft-spoken Washington and Lee
political science professor will wear
a proud smile Thursday at the
annual Omicron Delta Kappa tap day
ceremony.

His smile, however, will have a
slightly different meaning than those
of his colleagues or some of the stu-
dents. The difference for Prof. Rupert
N. Latture is that this will be the
46th Washington and Lee tapping
for the national honorary fraternity
which he helped found.

A former student of Prof. Latture
will deliver the tap day address at
noon in Doremus Gymnasium before
an assembly of faculty and students.
H. Graham Morison, a Washington
lawyer and former assistant attor-
ney general of the U.S., will speak
at the traditional tapping ceremony
which recognizes citizenship and
leadership displayed by outstanding
undergraduate and law seniors.

Omicron Delta Kappa—founded to
bring together campus leaders in a
more relaxed atmosphere—has grown
to national stature since its inception
on December 3, 1914, at Washington
and Lee. ODK alumni have even
come to outnumber the alumni of
the 212-year-old mother institution.

The 68-year-old chairman of the
university’s political science depart-

 

ment is one of eight of the 15 origi-
nal founders of ODK still living.

The national group was not born
in a professor’s committee meeting or
in a fraternity house basement. The
idea came about in a conversation in
1914 between Prof. Latture and his
college roommate, the late James C.
Fisher.

“We simply talked about having an
informal meeting of some of the stu-
dent instructors like ourselves,” Prof.
Latture recalls. “We talked all Spring
semester, but the idea was dormant
over the summer vacation.”

In the fall the rommates chatted
with William M. Brown, a student
instructor in German, and he became
the third member of the founding
triumvirate. The plans were present-
ed to some of their favorite Wash-
ington and Lee professors and with
the support of Dr. Henry Louis
Smith, the university’s president, a
small group was formed “to bridge
the gap between faculty and stu-
dents and help make clear the aspi-
rations of each.”

Thus, on December 3, the Alpha
Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa was
born. The designation circle rather
than chapter was decided upon be-

 

 

 

cause group plans had grown to in- PROF. R. N. LATTURE, one of ODK’s i5 founders, jim

Government In The Economy: A Problem

Ry ROBERT C. KETCHAM

Friday Columnist

The prominent socialist visiting
our campus this week has brought
to mind an under-
lying issue which
was greatly dis-
cussed during the
last presidential
campaign; that of
the role of gov-
ernment in our
economy.

The speech by
Mr. Thomas was
received by the
students with en-
comium. By con-
fining his talk primarily to the East-
West conflict and the four main areas
where progress must be forthcoming
he did not raise much point of eco-
nomic conflict.

Mr. Thomas was squarely con-
fronted only one time with the eco-
nomic issue of socialism when a
student asked the “whys” of social-
ized medicine. Perhaps socialism and
Mr. Thomas are not considered as
dangerous as they once were; or
on the other hand the present day
scholar would rather profess a great-
er tolerance for conflicting ideologies.

The clash between the two labels,
liberal and conservative, was re-
cently in a quasi-contest involving
the house rules committee change.
Even some of those on campus who

 

Ketcham

 

felt that the power of the commit-
tee was too strong and inconsistent
with true democratic process backed
the conservative forces because of
fear for the President’s proposed
legislation.

This example only points out the
concern for conservatism which,
on occasion, resorts to faulty logic
to carry the day just as FDR at-
temped on the other side with his
famous court packing plan.

Students on college campuses
throughout the country are said to
be moving to the right of center in
increasing numbers. Actually I
would cite the increasing ism of
involvement rather than the real
rise of conservatism for this phenom-
ena. The sit-ins, the “march on Wash-
ington,” even denouncement of com-
pulsory R.O.T.C. are all manifesta-
tions of this new ism.

These conservative voices are cur-
rently looking to Barry Goldwater
and William Buckley, Jr., for their
leadership. Goldwater’s The Con-
science of a Conservative is reported
to be selling best at 200 collegetown
bookstores across the land. The
Arizona senator has long been con-
vinced that the American people of
conservative bent have simply had
no one to vote for. Today he seems
at least to have given the conserva-

 

G. B. Is Not A Second Rate Power;
Must Be Included In World Affairs

By JON B. McLIN
Friday Columnist

(Editor’s note: The following
article submitted by our Oxford
correspondent is in two parts. Next
week we will carry the second
part.)

Oxford, Feb. 3—Every American
who goes abroad must at some time
be amazed at the number and extent
of misconceptions which he had, prior
to leaving the States, about conditions
elsewhere in the world, and I am
no exception. Today I would like
to write about one such misconcep-
tion, the prevalence of which in the
USS. is only exceeded, I think, by its
great seriousness. This is the com-

The student at Oxford—where stu-
dents from India, Pakistan, Austral-
ia, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana are
to be found by the score—can hard-
ly avoid the conclusion that the
British Commonwealth of Nations
is a virile, meaningful association
fraught with the importance of the
international scene of 1961.

And, if anything, these students
from the “colonies” exert an influ-
ence here far out of proportion to
their number. This can be seen from
a partial list of the Oxford societies
concerned with these countries: the
Africa Society, United Nations Asso-
ciation, East Africa Society, Friends’
(of Asians and Africans) Society,
Islamic Union, Oxford Majlis (for the
promotion of better understanding
of the peoples of Asia and Africa),
the Schweitzer Society, the South
African Association, the Far Eastern
Society, the Indian Society, the
Strasbourgh Club (concerned with
the political integration of Europe),
and JACARI—Joint Action Commit-
tee Against Racial Intolerance—
which is concerned primarily with
better understanding of Africa.

In addition to the programs of
speakers, etc., which these societies
all present, they produce an aware-
ness throughout the University which
is reflected in such programs as
War on Want, a food program for
the Congo, and a boycott against
South African goods in _ protest
against the policy of apartheid.

This international awareness is
is accentuated by the fact that the
British Foreign Service derives vir-
tually all of its officers from the
student bodies of Oxford and Cam-
bridge, and frequently their student

tive collegian someone to shout (or
flaunt) about.

The two points of view are in con-
flict directly when it comes to the
value of government. The liberal
of today views government as an
inherent good while the conserva-
tive finds government necessary but
nevertheless an inherent evil. To at-
tempt further to button down the
collegiate view; conservatives follow
Lockian and Jeffersonian ideals while
as Max Lerner said, liberalism of
the future must be concerned not
so much with freedom from as with
freedom for.

Today no word such as social-
ism, capitalism or Communism rep-
resents the airtight compartment
that it once did. Each system has
shopped about for methods in the
other which it can use. It is a

 

dangerous mistake to view any of
these systems as either all white
or all black.

American industrialists, and I
might add, their sons, are much
more fearful of economic admixtures
than are their European counter-
parts. Some executives of important
industries in Europe find no fault
with the government ownership of
Renault for example. The enter-
prise is self-sustaining and based
on its profits they point out. Further-
more the privately owned Deux
Chevaux, made by Citroen, outsells
the competing Renault.

Any definition of these two con-
flicting viewpoints, liberalism and
conservatism, would necessarily
presupposed some bias or overgener-
alization. In America it is really the

Students Unite! Destroy The Iconoclasts’ Image!

Take Iconoclasm Out Of The American Living Room!

By THORNS CRAVEN
Friday Columnist

Since all the fog seems to have
settled in the form of snow there’s
not too much
around town to do.
It’s too cold to
throw snowballs at
old ladies, and the
Executive Com-
mittee frowns on
stealing sleds from
little kids, so
what’s left?

For myself I’ve
decided to en-
joy  iconoclasm
Looking at last
Friday’s paper gave me the idea, and
immediately I learned that this pleas-
ure involves listening to LP’s and
watching TV. While Victor Lasseter
outlined for us in a sketchy way
how to enjoy iconoclasm, what he
mostly did was to tell some of Mort
Sahl’s worst jokes. I decided that
there must be a better way.

In the true W&L tradition I de-
cided that the first step was to de-
fine terms. Lasseter stated that “there
has always been a strong tradition
of iconoclasm in American humor,
but with the coming of the television

set and the long-playing record you
can now enjoy iconoclasm in your
own living room.” Obviously the
most important word in this sentence
is “iconoclasm,” so I looked it up.
What a disturbing effect the defini-
tion had. Iconoclasm is image break-
ing!

Now in the dark days of American
humor—pre TV-LP—I can see how
this might have been fun. Everybody
would get together and break images.
But today I’m against it. Imagine a
pile of broken images on the living
room floor every night. And I have
enough trouble with dust to know
that I don’t want my diamond needle
to take on any images.

Needless to say after my prelimi-
nary investigation of iconoclasm as
Mr. Lasseter stated it (with clarifi-
cation by Webster) I’m against it.
But since I’m still interested in hu-
mor I suppose I'll have to find some
acceptable alternative form (since
this is in the true W&L tradition).
Actually it seems that any form of
humor that contains not a trace of
iconoclasm would be acceptable to
rational people. A further look at the

Generals’ Team Effort Upsets R-M, 73-69;
inia Here Monday Night

Hapless Virg

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Sports Editor

Washington and Lee’s Generals
brought back memories of Southern
Conference basketball Thursday
night as they slapped Randolph-
Macon’s towering Little Eight power-
house, 73-69, at Doremus gym.

With 12:35 left in the first half,
the Generals started to click as they
overcame a three-point Randolph-
Macon advantage, and hustled to a
41-28 halftime lead.

It was truly a combined team
effort that boosted the Generals
into their commanding halftime
lead and the eventual victory.

In the first half the Generals hit
nearly everything they threw from
the floor ranging from 20-30 foot

 

33 Out For Baseball
More Players Sought

Coach Joe Lyles announced to-
day that the initial meeting of the
varsity baseball squad for the ’61
season was held last night at 7:30
p.m. All told, 33 players reported
in, yet attention is called to the
fact that any student desiring to
play this spring may still contact
Coach Lyles. The opening game is
with Dartmouth.

 

jump shots by Brett Thackston and
Bill Ide to driving layups by Bip
Fauber to a beautiful tap-in by Steve
Rutledge to an an amazing back-
handed tap-in by “Killer” Kowalski.

Kowalski’s unbelievable back-
handed tap gave Coach Bob Mc-
Henry confidence.

“The one time I thought we were
meant to win was when Kowalski
was sandwiched between two 6-5
players, and the ball went into the
basket,” McHenry said.

For the last 13 minutes of the
first half, W&L hit a phenomenal
17 of 25 shots from the floor—a
68.0 percentage.

Randolph-Macon started the sec-
ond half looking for blood, but the
Generals managed to hang on to
the victory.

With 5:00 left in the game, R-M’s
Buddy Allen tied the score, 56-56,
with two free throws.

But little Brett Thackston, who
was the Generals’ second highest
scorer for the game, sank a long
jump shot to put the Generals ahead
for keeps.

Thackston then widened the
W&L margin to five points with
another 30-foot jump shot and two
free throws.

Thackston’s two free throws with
4:45 left in the game started a string

Ray Robrecht

Returns To Ring Feb. 23
For Roanoke P.A.L. Bout

Washington and Lee’s one-man team returns to action on

 

of 13 straight W&L charity tosses
that clinched the game.

In the game’s final three minutes,
fiery playmaker Thackston, who was
10 for 10 from the foul line, added
four more free throws. Fauber con-
tributed five straight charity tosses
and Rutledge, two.

“The key to our second half
was foul shooting. We made our
last 13 points on free throws and
they missed several in the game’s
final minute,’ McHenry said.

“We just hung on like a machine
in the second half. We didn’t move
well, we didn’t shoot well, we just
hung on.”

 

But the first half was a different
story. The Generals did nearly every-
thing McHenry asked them to do
well.

The Generals hustled on defense,
holding Randolph-Macon to just
six field goals and a shooting per-
centage of 15.6.

The Generals boxed in the much
taller Yellow Jackets on the boards.
R-M got only five offensive rebounds
the first half, while W&L got seven
offensive rebounds.

McHenry credits the Generals’
blazing first half to many things:

“We moved well on offense. We
tried to keep the pressure on them

by hustling, hustling, and hustling.
We really hustled on defense. We
really scrapped on the boards. The
boys were dead set on winning.
Their play was all heart.”

Those are some of the contribut-
ing factors that make a top flight
basketball club and the Generals
displayed them last night.

McHenry was very pleased over
the Generals’ ability to do anything
he asked them to do.

“They did almost everything I
could ever ask them to do in a game.
They switched defensive assignments.
They changed offensive positions.
They used two different offenses.

And they played a good game.”

Fauber paced the W&L scor-
ing with 23 points, his best effort
of the year. The 6-2 forward made
eight of 13 shots from the floor—
a 61.7 percentage—and seven of
nine free throws—a 77.7 percent-
age. Fauber, who didn’t let up at
anytime during the game, grabbed
17 rebounds and slowed down
Frank Kamiski, R-M’s big gun,
late in the second half when Mc-
Henry assigned Kamiski to him.

Joining Fauber in the scoring pa-
rade were Thackston with 18 points;
Rutledge, who played his best game
of the season, with 11 points; and
Ide and Kowalski, who both played
good games, with seven points each.

The Generals, who spotted Ran-
dolph-Macon two inches per man,
outrebounded the Yellow Jackets,
59-56. Rutledge trailed Fauber in
the W&L rebounding department
with 12, his season high.

Kamiski topped both the Ran-
dolph-Macon scoring and rebound-
ing with 27 points and 18 rebounds.

Washington and Lee hit 24 of 63
shots from the floor for a 39.7 per-
centage, its best of the season and
sank 25 of 31 free throws for a
phenomenal 80.7 percentage.

Prof. Latture Marks Anniversary
As One Of ODK Founders

clude a variety of student activities.

The purpose of the new group—
a purpose that has remained un-
changed in 46 years—was threefold:
to recognize men who have attain-
ed a high standard of efficiency in
collegiate activities, to bring to-
gether the most representative men
in all phases of college life and to
collect members of the faculty and
student body of an institution on the
bases of mutual interests and under-
standing.

“The objectives we set in 1914 and
early 1915 have not changed one
iota,” Prof, Latture notes proudly.
“I’m constantly impressed with the
sincerity with which the boys on
this campus and others work in their
selections of new members, and I
ought to know since I’ve only missed
four meetings of the Alpha Circle in
some 40 years and sat in a lot of
meetings at other colleges.”

ODK was not destined to remain
a local group for long, however.
Within a year, Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity established a circle largely
through the efforts of Dr. Robert
Dickey, a graduate student there in
those days and now head of Wash-
ington and Lee’s physics depart-
ment.

The University of Pittsburgh set
up the third circle after Prof. Lat-
ture, then a graduate student at
Washington and Lee, appeared in a
debating tournament there sporting
a strange looking key. The specially-
designed key piqued their interest
and they began asking questions
about ODK and its purpose. (The
key was designed by Prof. Latture
and embraces the Greek letters Omi-
cron Delta Kappa and a star for
each of the 15 founders.)

Since 1917 some 90 ODK circles
have been formed at colleges and
universities throughout the country.

Such men as Presidents Herbert
Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt,
General of the Army George C. Mar-
shall, Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
Secretary of the Army Elvis J. Starr,
former American Bar Association
president Ross Malone and the new
president of the American council
on education, Dr. Logan Wilson, have
worn the ODK key.

“I am still everwhelmed when I
think of the expansion of our group
and it is most gratifying to see that

ODK maintains a steady level of
prestige at most colleges,” Prof. Lat-
ture said.

An example of its popularity and
rank at many colleges is exempli-
fied by the consistent John Hopkins
students’ claim that ODK is the
“highest honor on campus.”

Two years ago, Washington and
Lee students in cooperation with
the national office of ODK presented
Prof. Latture, a member of the uni-
versity’s faculty since 1920, with
a certificate citing his steadfast con-
tributions to the progress of the na-
tional group.

Prof. Latture is a native of Bristol,
Tenn., and served with the French
Army in 1917 and 1918 receiving the
coveted Croix de Guerre. He was
valedictorian of his graduating class
in 1915 and is a member of Phi Beta

Kappa.

definition bears this out.

The practitioner of iconoclasm is
called an iconoclast. Here’s what
Webster says about that vile crea-
ture: “A breaker of icons, or images;
an opponent of religious use of im-
ages. One who attacks cherished
beliefs as shams.” (The adj. is icono-
clastic). Need I say more? Imagine
America’s youth being poisoned by
icon breakers. The zip guns of the
country will be turned on the stained
glass windows. The father and moth-
er images will be smashed (and with
that the Greek classics will suffer.
Who will remember Oedipus and
Electra?) The list lengthens and I’m
apalled.

Let’s band together and get this
iconoclasm out of American living
rooms. We can get the Chamber of
Commerce to make it: “Clean-up.
Paint-up, Fix-up, Deiconoclize-up
Week.” There’s so much work to be
done. The first step is to break all
Mort Sahl records. Destroy the image
of the iconoclasts. Students of Amer-
ica, unite!

careers augur the kind of profes-
sional future they will have.

Is this importance ascribed to the
colonies on Oxford only apparent or
is it real? And, if real, is there a
reason for it which often goes un-
noticed? I would claim that it is real
and that there is an important reason
for it. Britain recognizes the import-
ance of her Commonwealth ties, and
by maintaining them in good faith
she is doing no less than holding
Africa and Asia for the West.

This is a sweeping statement and
should not be accepted without an
examination of what is involved. Its
justification lies, I think, in the fact
that British Colonial policies in this
century have been extraordinarily
wise, realistic, and foresighted. This
is true both for basic policies and
the manner in which these policies
have been executed.

There are at least two significant
aspects of basic policy which show
this political wisdom. First is the
underlying British assumption that
they were going to the colonies as
temporary administrators, not—as
with the French colonizers—as per-
manent settlers. Second is the point
that the British—in sharp contrast
to the Belgians in the Congo— have
in most cases taken great pains to
train native administrators for the
day when they would take over their
own country.

The latter principle was of great
importance to the successful con-
summation of the colonial relation-
ship when the British made such
courageous and wise decisions as
those to pull out of India in 1947 or
out of Ghana in 1951 or to allow the

G.B. Is Not A Second Rate Power

Union of South Africa in 1903. Other
wise acts of colonial administration
may be seen in the quick and effec-
tive way in which the Mau Mau re-
bellion in Kenya was squelched; in
the smooth transition to indepen-
dence made in Nigeria last fall; in
the way in which British citizens
were protected in the Congo last
summer; and in the current policy
of restraining independence for
Tanganyika—in cooperation with
the statesmanlike efforts of Nyer-
ere—until Kenya is also ready, and
their joint independence can be
consummated in an East African fed-
eration.

It is my contention that the threat
of increased Communist influence in
Asia and Africa has been greatly
mitigated by these wise policies of
colonial administration which have
allowed the newly independent na-
tions to retain, with dignity, close
ties to Britain and hence to the
West. This is especially significant
when it is remembered that the
hopes of the West in these two great
continents rest largely on the
strength of three countries, all for-
mer British colonies; India, Ghana,
and Nigeria.

battle of The New Republic and The
Progressive versus The National Re-
view. As Justice Holmes once said,
“No generalization is entirely true,
including this one” and we must go
on.

Where then have we come to?
What similarities are there? The first
example is that concept of the profit
motive which Americans believe in.
American industrialists usually
equate profits with our system of
free enterprise. Mr. Peter F. Drucker
in his book Concept of the Corpora-
tion says that a society which accepts
economic advancement as socially
desirable will find the profit motive
the most efficient device for achiev-
ing it.

But does Russia have something
that can also be called profit? I
think it does. It has it in the sense
that Russia has been consuming
less than it produces. The surplus
or profit is for the whole of the
Russian economy.

I have already mentioned John
Locke. At one time the liberal view
was founded on the shoals of “rug-
ged individualism.” According to
Locke, the government exists for
the purpose of protecting individual
rights. Jeremy Bentham has rendered
obsolete the natural rights concept as
