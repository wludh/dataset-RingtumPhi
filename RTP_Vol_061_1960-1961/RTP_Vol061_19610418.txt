Spring Concert
Set For April 26
In Lee Chapel

By ROGER PAINE

In its busiest spring season in his-
tory, the Washington and Lee Glee
Club will present six major con-
certs in the course of the next three
weeks. Of major importance to W&Li
will be the annual Spring Concert,
which will be given in Lee Chapel
on April 26 with the Westhampton
College Choir.

The Glee Club will present an all
new repertoire for 1961 at the Spring
Concert, and the Westhampton Choir
will sing the most outstanding num-
bers from its latest selection of tunes.

This Thursday, April 20, the Glee
Club will make a road trip to Long-
wood College to repeat the per-
formance of the Faure “Requiem”
which was given here at the Lex-
ington Presbyterian Church before
spring vacation. Then in the first
week of May, the Club will go to
Richmond to repeat the spring con-
cert that will be given here for the
University of Richmond.

Staying overnight in Richmond,
the Club then plans a trip to Wil-
mington, Del., where alumni have
organized a singing engagement and
a party for the entire group. Andy
Leonard will accompany the Club
to sing a few of the numbers from
Steve Danzansky’s spring musical.
He will be assisted by Phil Booth
and Dave Munroe, both regular
members of the Glee Club, in “I
Make a Study,” “Stay Away from
the Opposite Sex,” and “All of a
Sudden,” from the show.

The Brass Choir, which has been
rehearsing steadily all year long,
also will accompany the Glee Club
on its tour, as will the Capparales,
a singing group in the Glee Club
which specializes in their own ar-
rangements of past popular hits.

While in Wilmington the Glee
Club will also sing at the Tower
Hill High School, and plans to re-
turn late on Thursday, May 4.
This will conclude the 1960-61 sea-
son for the Glee Club with a grand
total of eleven concerts.

Mr. Robert Stewart, director of
the Glee Club, and Don Partington,
this year’s president, are both large-
ly responsible for the success of
the club this year. In comparing the
club as it is now with what it was
when Mr. Stewart began directing
it, it is easy to see how much work,
time and patience has gone into its
molding and perfecting.

The first year the Glee Club was
formed, it gave three concerts in-
stead of the eleven given this year,
none of which were done with mixed
choral groups, and one of which was
merely the traditional Christmas
candlelight service.

 

ROSIE PAGE
Running for president

Rosie Page’s varied leadership on
campus was recognized this year
when he was one of two juniors
elected to ODK. The SAE rising
senior, from Beaver Dam, Va., is
EC representative this year and was
president of his sophomore class.
He is editor of the Tuesday edition
of the Ring-tum Phi.

Page is a member of SWMSFC and
the Dance Board. He was named
IFC outstanding freshman in 1958-59.
He has been on the varsity foot-
ball, baseball, and wrestling teams.
A dormitory counselor this year,
Page is an honor roll student and
a member of Phi Eta Sigma.

 

Mock Trial Is Tomorrow,
Case Involves Accident

The Law School will hold its
Spring mock trial tomorrow in the
Moot Court Room. The case is a
suit arising out of an automobile
fatality in which the brother-in-law
of the deceased, who asserts he is
unable to support himself and re-
ceived his only support from the de-
ceased, is seeking to recover damages
for loss of support.

Counsel for the plaintiff is Bill
King, intermediate law student. The
defendants, Frank Hoss and Ken
Huntingdon, will be defended by
senior law students Dick Lary and
Tom Kroetz.

The first session of the trial will
be held tomorrow from 3 to 5:30
p.m. and a second session from 7:30
p.m. until the trial is concluded.
The Mock Trial Committee invites
interested students and _ faculty
members to attend. The Law wives
will serve refreshments in the law
student lounge after the trial.

Professor Robert E. R. Huntley of
the Law School will preside.

Registration will continue to-
morrow and Thursday.

Speaker For Tucker Lectures
Is Prettyman, Lexington Native

The Hon. E. Barrett Prettyman,
circuit judge of the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit and a native of
Lexington, will deliver the 13th
John Randolph Tucker Lectures in
Law at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity on April 21-22.

Judge Prettyman will speak
twice Friday and once Saturday in
Lee Chapel on the general topic of
“Some Modern Problems in Crimi-
nal Law.” Lectures at noon and 8
p.m. Friday will deal with “The
Problem of the Indigent” and “The
Problem of the Incompetent.” Satur-
day at noon, Judge Prettyman will
conclude with a discussion of “The
Problem of the Juvenile.”

A large number of Washington
and Lee Law School alumni are ex-
pected to return for the lectures and
the annual meeting of the Law
School Association. The Tucker Lec-
tures also are attended by non-
alumni attorneys and law students
from other institutions. They also
are open to the general public.

The Tucker Lectures were estab-
lished in 1949 as a part of Wash-
ington and Lee’s bicentennial cele-
bration. They honor the memory of
John Randolph Tucker’s service to
the University as dean of the Law
School.

 

The late John W. Davis, a Wash-
ington and Lee alumnus, nationally
famous attorney and the 1924 Dem-
ocratic presidential candidate, de-
livered the first Tucker Lectures.
Other distinguished judges, attor-
neys, and educators who have par-
ticipated in the series are Judge
Arthur T. Vanderbilt, Judge John J.
Parker, John Lord O’Brian, Judge
Joseph C. Hutcheson, Jr., Judge
Harold R. Medina, Dean Robert G.
Storey, William T. Gossett, Dean
Frederick Deane Goodwin Ribble,
John J. McCloy, Whitney North
Seymour, and Ross L. Malone.

Judge Prettyman, who assumed
his present position of chief judge
in 1958, is the son of a Lexington
Methodist minister. He received his
A.B. and M.A. degrees at Randolph-
Macon college and earned his LL.B.
degree at Georgetown University by
attending night classes while teach-
ing public school at Kensington, Md.,
and Alexandria.

He was admitted to the Virginia
Bar in 1915 and established practice
in Hopewell. Following service in
World War I as an infantry officer,
he served briefly as counsel to the
Internal Revenue Service’s New
York Bureau, and then joined the

 

| four parts.

** Peace Corpsmen

May Be Given Draft

Exemptions”’-H ershey

Peace Corps volunteers can be
deferred from military service un-
der the present Universal Military
Training and Service Act, says Lt.
Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, director
of Selective Service. His views were
outlined in an editorial in the April
issue of Selective Service Bulletin.

“The relationship of the Selective
Service System with registrants who
become members of the Peace Corps
can be handled administratively,”
Hershey wrote.

He said that the classification of
registrants in the Peace Corps “can
be handled as any other registrant
engaged in activities in the national
health, safety, or interest.”

When they return home, volun-
teers could qualify for further de-
ferment.

Important factors listed by Her-
shey for consideration when the
volunteer returns home include his
age, his physical condition, his mari-
tal status, the regulations which ap-
ply when he is released “and wheth-
er or not the registrant on his re-
turn from service with the Peace
Corps engages in an activity which
permits him to be deferred in the
national health, safety, or interest.”

Hershey concluded: “The fact that
the registrant has been a member of
the Peace Corps will not prevent
him from qualifying for further de-
ferment, the same as any other reg-
istrant who is engaged in activities
vital to the national health, safety,
or interest.

of this student body. The candidates
for these offices will also be given
the opportunity to present any poli-
cies or platforms if they so desire.

*Vardaman for president of Finals

‘dance set. Both are seniors.

Charlie McCord and Danny Mark-
stein, rising juniors, will run for
the presidencies of Spring and
Opening dances, respectively.

The rival Independent Party has
not yet announced its slate of can-
didates for the “Big Seven” offices.
Sources in the Independent Party
say that the strongest contenders
for their top nominations are Ray
Robrecht, Steve Suttle, Steve Rut-
ledge, and Dave Montgomery.

No “Dealing”

The University Party, according to
party chairman John Farmer, de-
parted considerably from its prac-
tice in the past of making advance
commitments among fraternities to
support each other’s candidates.
This “dealing” had brought some
criticism.

“There were no advance commit-
ments between fraternities concern-
ing the nomination of their candi-
dates,” said Farmer. “We feel this
reflects a marked desire to prove
we want to serve the student body.”

“I think that by bringing our
candidates out early the University
will become more familiar with her
potential student leaders. The Uni-
versity Party feels that we have
endorsed the best possible men to
serve Washington and Lee,” Farmer
added.

“Our nominess can stand a search-
ing examination by the student
body,” he said.

Independent Party chairman Bill
Johnston is expected to announce
his party’s slate of “Big Seven” can-
didates later this week.

Student body elections for the
three EC officers and the dance set
presidents will be held April 27.

Nominations will be officially sub-
mitted at a student assembly in
Lee Chapel Monday night at 7:30.

_| The nominating speeches are tradi-

tionally the only real campaign ora-
tory heard on campus. Members
of the two opposing parties will

| whoop it up for their candidates.

Questions Yet To Be Answered

While waiting for the Indepen-
dent Party to present its candidates
campus political observers are ask-
ing some other questions:

This year there have been a
number of suggestions for changes
in the procedure and duties of the
EC with respect to the Honor Sys-
tem. Will any of the candidates
propose a “reform” program?

Many observers have noted that
the Independent Party seems to
have met the problem that they are
in the minority by running those
they feel are their strongest candi-
dates against those they feel are
the weakest on the University Party
slate. Will they feel themselves
strong enough to mount a frontal
attack on the “Big Clique” this
year?

Class elections come up shortly
after the “Big Seven” elections. Are
any major candidates holding back,
waiting instead to try for a class
presidency or EC post?

Will a third or fourth party ap-
pear? Will such a move be serious?

Party lines appear solid. The last
switch occurred when the Sigma
Chis left the Independent Party to
join the University Party in 1958.

There are ten houses in the Uni-
versity Party: Phi Kap, DU, Sigma
Chi, Sigma Nu, ZBT, Beta, KA,
PiKA, Phi Delt, and SAE.

The Independent Party numbers
eight houses: Delt, Phi Gam, Phi
Psi, Lambda Chi, SPE, Kappa Sig,
Pi Kap, and PEP.

Non-fraternity men, for lack of or-
ganization, have seldom been repre-
sented in either party. But the In-
dependent Party seemed to be cast-
ing eyes on their votes, which out-
numbered any four houses, when
they nominated Bill Noell, who had
not pledged a fraternity, for fresh-
| man EC representative this fall.

The Ring-tum Phi

Tuesday Edition

Good Show, No Dough

Steve Danzansky and Dave Lefkowitz are to be com-
mended for their production of the SWMSFC musical. The
show was of professional calibre, and we have heard nothing
but praise from those who saw it.

The show was an immense project. Danzansky began early
last summer on the script and songs, and the entire cast prac-
ticed for ten weeks prior to opening night. Those directly con-
cerned with the production numbered well over a hundred,
making the show the largest extra-curricular activity on campus.

And herein lies our criticism. ‘Heads or Tails” became a
goal in itself. Lost in all the excitement was the fact that the
purpose of the show was to provide funds for scholarships.
The show was backed, and paid for, by the Student War
Memorial Scholarship Fund Committee, whose only purpose
is implicit in its name.

It appears, however, that there will be no profit from the
week-long run of “Heads or Tails.” At best, the show will break
even. The costs encountered by Danzansky and his cast were
much greater than those anticipated by Lefkowitz and the com-
mittee.

It is possible that the slow will go on the road, perhaps to
Hollins and Randolph-Macon. Yet, again, the expense might
very well exceed the income. And it is difficult to ask the cast
and committee to make still more sacrifices.

Hindsight is certainly a great deal less difficult than fore-
sight. This year’s show was an unqualified success, yet we feel
that in the future the production should be kept more in line
with the purpose. Washington and Lee is very proud and happy
with her musical, yet it seems a shame that everyone’s hard work
on the show could not have increased the funds available for

War Memorial Scholarships.

Hollins
Criticizes
Honor System

From The Sophian, Smith Col-
lege:

According to results of a question-
neire distributed recently by Honor
Court, Hollins College students dis-
satisfied with the present Honor
System are in a majority. The fol-
lowing results were compiled:

That the honor system lacks the
greatest possible support of students
wes the feeling of 231 students, 50
being freshmen. Weaknesses were
divided into two main categories: 1)
leck of support which is due to lack
of honor, interest and co-operation
among students; 2) that the system
is spread too thin and includes too
meny minute offenses.

Other weaknesses listed by stu-
dents were: interpretation of the
system is too vague; the school’s in-
terpretation of honor is obscure;
upperclassmen fail to set a respect-
able example for freshmen; support
of the system becomes progressively
weaker with each class, moving from
freshmen to seniors.

A close tally was noticed on the
question of whether the system
should include all phases of college
life: 197 said no, 128 said yes. Of
the negative answers 178 felt only
lying, stealing, and cheating should
be honor violations while 131 stu-
dents stated that serious social vio-
lations should be included; 12 were
in favor of the point system and 82
wished to include failure to report
one’s self.

The final question—if some or all
social rules were not under the
honor system, do you think they

' delicate touch of a professional bil-

By STEVE HENRY

Ahmad Jamal is a slender, wispish
man who shakes hands with the

liards player.

After the concert Saturday, he
came out of his dressing room wear-
ing a continental suit and a fur
(probably mink) skull cap, which
may or may not be continental. We
did not know.

What we did know was that we
hod just seen and heard a jazzman
extraordinary, one of the fading
group of individual artists whose
on-stage presence generates some-
thing akin to an electrical charge
between performer and audience.

Jamal’s piano drowned out the
miscellaneous noise left behind by
the big bands of past dance sets,
and in doing so perhaps ushered in
a most agreeable trend, namely the
appearance in Doremus Gym of more
young, brilliant entertainers rather
than stereotyped big band perform-
ers.

We thought it appropriate to begin
an interview with Jamal by asking
something about music, so we started
off by asking him about Ornette
Coleman, whose name is currently
“in” with 1961 jazz buffs.

“He’s_ interesting,” said Jamal.
“lve been too busy to study Cole-
man thoroughly.” Which more or
less closed the matter.

What about Ray Charles?

“He makes a lot of money—he’s
popular.”

But is he a real musician?

“He makes money.”

Obviously Jamal wasn’t in the
mood for discussing fellow musi-
cians.

But he was pointedly interested
in talking about a non-musical ven-
ture in which he is currently invol-
ved—the opening of an international
restaurant in Chicago.

 

The new restaurant, the Cour de
Leon, will be designed as an exact
replica of the international eating
place of the same name in Spain.

“The Cour de Leon will be totally
non-alcoholic,” said Jamal.

Why so?

“Because serving liquor to our
clientele reduces the standard of
the cuisine which we will serve. We
will offer the best talent and food
in the world, but no liquor.”

Your connection with the restau-
rant?

“President of the corporation,” he
smiled.

Matter closed. Too much com-
mercialism.

What takes you from plush night
club engagements and brings you to
this and other campuses?

“I came here as a favor,” said
Jemal. “A friend of mine backed out
on you, so I came. Somebody had
to play. Besides, I'd rather play
colleges than night clubs. The au-
diences are more appreciative.”

At this point we almost choked.
Surely Jamal, the sensitive, creative
artist, had wanted to slam his Stein-
way shut and stalk off stage during
the concert he had just finished.
People were constantly moving
eround in the audience, making a
cacaphony of mumbo-jumbo noises,
end we had always thought such
disturbance led high-strung per-
formers to tear out their hair.

Was this audience okay today?

“Yes, they were fine—very well-
mannered. I enjoyed playing here
very much.”

And the accommodations?

“Fine, just fine.”

That was the last question we
were able to ask. Jamal, pressed for
time from the outset (he had often
waved off applause so he could fin-
ish the concert quicker), took a po-

 

lite but final leave.

And then we were off to Red
Square to hear some horses of a
different color, or should we say a
different orientation musically.

The Five Royales, a combo of
questionable moral standards, per-
formed, but not too long.

The high point of the afternoon,
music-wise, came when a_ well-
known rock-and-roll star, namely
Walt Selman, took over at the elec-
tric guitar for a guest shot.

Selman, accompanied by a fra-
ternity brother, brought down the
house, and raised the standards of
the Royales, who really were prob-
ly more worried about the income
tax man than they were about per-
forming.

Night-time brought the combo
parties. And it also brought the
great influx of transitory, college-
type drinking bums from other uni-
versities.

This is a constant source of
amazement for us. There were more
strange faces around campus last
week-end than at Fancy Dress,
which means that there were about
two visitors for every student here.

Why anyone would want to leave
his own fair campus and exodus to
ours just to throw a drunk is be-
yond our comprehension.

Anyway, we saw all kinds—the
loud Wahoos, the quiet Wahoos, the
guys from Duke, North Carolina,
etc. There were even a few Ivies
around.

The Ivies are the easiest to rec-
ognize. One guy from Princeton,
whom we know to be the epitome of
what every Ivy leaguer wants to
be, was the picture of refinement
and composure during the week-
end.

Until, that is, he took his third
drink, and then he was singing
with the combo and throwing one
heck of a horror show.

A man-on-the-colonnade poll,

taken by this reporter on Friday,

Saturday, and Monday, indicates that

there’s a good deal of sentiment for
changing the honor system.

The question asked was: “Do
you faver changing any aspect of
the honor system as it is defined in
the Constitution?”

Out of 145 respondents, 56 an-
swered “yes,” 48 answered “no,” and
41 were unable to answer either way.
Significantly, many respondents fell
into this third category because they
did not know how the system is
defined in the Constitution.

The “yes” answers amount to 38.6

 

| per cent of the total.

Projected
onto a student body of 1,072, this
percentage suggests that as many as
414 students favor some change.

When such a significant number
of students favor changing the Con-
stitution, it would seem only fair
that they have recourse to the
amendment process. The large num-
ber of undecided voters, as evidenced
by the poll, might yield a few hun-
dred more votes for the amendment.

Under the present Constitution,
any amendment that is approved by
the Executive Committee can be
ratified by a simple majority of
the whole student body.

But when the EC doesn’t approve
an amendment, it must get a two-

 

The Academy Awards have come
up again, and Elizabeth Taylor was
predicted to win on the basis of
her London performance. Just as the
motion picture people look back on
their year to mete out rewards for
outstanding work, so must we at
Washington and Lee. Hence, and
forthwith, this year’s awards.

Rose’s Lime Juice (in coordination
with The New Yorker): for perform-
ing the nearly impossible by con-
vincing the common american fool
that bottled lime juice (which the
English use because fresh limes are
unavailable to them) is better in a
drink than fresh lime juice.

Dukes of Dixieland: for demon-
strating why dixieland jazz has no
more musical vitality but is popular
because it is loud and predictable.

Playboy Magazine: for all but
eliminating the word “sophisticate”
from the conversation of literate
people by their incessant, intermin-
able, imbecilic use of it. Additionally,
for pretending to purvey culture but
really pandering to adolescent onan-
ism.

Board of Supervisors, Rockbridge
County: for deciding not to have
daylight saving time, despite Lex-
ington’s adoption of it, because if
they did “little children would have
to get up for school at 5:45 a.m.”

The Maury River: for not freez-
ing over, in spite of the lousy weath-
er.

The Person Who Put the Seal on
the Dining Hall: for obvious and oft-
stated reasons.

Protest: for printing the worst
prose available, and capping that
with the most puerile poetry imag-
inable.

The Virginia State Legislature: for
increasing the tax on whiskey, beer,
and cigarettes, thus demonstrating
that the law of diminishing returns
still operates, and subtly outwitting
the Federal Government by increas-
ing the bootleggers’ business at the
expense of the revenue agents.

 

ROTC conducts its retreat ceremony,
that they have outgrown § such
bourgeois habits as respect for the
traditions, symbols and ceremonies
of their country.

To the Administration: for recog-
nizing the gravity of the parking
problem by proceeding with plans
which have eliminated approximate-
ly forty parking places.

The Washington Post: for recog-
nizing the failure of its frontal at-
tack and attempting a flanking
movement through the purchase of
Newsweek.

American Congressmen (both par-
ties): for, having been warned sev-
eral years in advance that the Soviet
Union would put a man in orbit first,
staying calm and refusing to make
hysterical statements for publication
when it did.

Various song birds and other
feathered friends: for bringing joy
and melody into my otherwise cheer-
less life, particularly at five in the
morning when I am trying to pretend
that I haven’t got a headache.

The elections for editors and busi-

could be handled as or more effec-

swered negatively by 94 students, 57
of them freshmen. They felt that a
police system, which would obvious-
ly be the remedy, would permit the
attitude that students could break
rules as long as they coul escape
unnoticed. This situation would cre-
ate a lack of responsibility toward
the system.

There were 140 affirmative an-
swers. Two categories of these were
students in favor of having no social
rules under the system, and those
who specified that serious social
regulations should be under the
system, excluding minor rules.

Controversy often arises over the

W&L Constitution Assumes EC To Be Superior,
Provides For Oligarchical Student Government

thirds vote of the student body—
as many as 715 votes. Practically
speaking, this is impossible.

In last year’s Big Seven election,
when party pressures and personal
feelings brought an unusually large
turnout to the polls, 922 students
voted.

In an amendment referendum,
there would probably not be more
than 800 voters even if excitement
were at fever pitch. Thus less than
100 voters could defeat it.

Moreover, it is probable that, in
many referendums, less than two-
thirds of the students would even
vote. Thus the amendment would be
automatically defeated.

Having read the Constitution
rather carefully, I am convinced
that it was intended to create an
oligarchical form of government.
That is, student affairs are to be
handled by a powerful elite group,
superior in all respects to other
students.

Most of us, however, profess to
believe in a democratic form of gov-
ernment. We (theoretically) believe
that every man should have a voice
in deciding how he is governed, that
he should have free access to in-
formation about the conduct of his
government, and that he should have
the power to initiate changes when
his government dissatisfies him.

According to our Constitution,
however, all judicial, legislative, and
executive powers are vested in the
EC. There is no system of checks
and balances, and very little sepa-
ration of powers.

The Constitution assumes that
the EC will be a superior group.
A large part of its superiority,
however, comes from the fact that
it knows more secrets than any-
one else. It guards this superiority
by always working in secret.

Yet our Constitution also implies
that the students, rather than the EC
are the real source of power. The
EC is merely an instrument of the
voters; it should not be allowed to
take any significant legislative ac-
tion without first consulting the
voters.

If a large number of Constitutions
could be distributed before April
27 (when Grayfred Gray’s amend-
ment will be voted on), more stu-
dents might be able to vote intel-
ligently.

If fraternity members will ask
pointed questions to the Executive
Committee when they visit the
houses in the next few days, they
might gain valuable information.

And if students demand that their
clique-picked Big Seven candidates
also face up to the questions about
the honor system and the Constitu-
tion, we will have a better idea of
who is best suited to serve us in the
EC next year.

LX Team Defeats Loyola
But Loses To Baltimore

By RANDY COLE

The Generals’ stickmen on Satur-
day April 8 put down the Loyola
College team by a score of 13-6 in
a contest which was held on Wilson
Field. However, this weekend the
Generals met with less success.

Saturday, Washington and Lee’s
lacrosse team turned in a creditable
performance as the Generals lost
to the University of Baltimore by
a score of 14-5.

The game was much better play-
ed than the score would seem to
indicate. Charlie Gummey, Rondy
Wooten, Jim Powers, and Herb
Tinley all turned in fine perform-
ances in a contest which saw the
Generals exhibit one of their fin-
est efforts of the year. This was
accomplished despite the absences
of Ray Gordon, ace attack star,
and Ray Miller, also on the first
team.

Gordon will be out for the season
due to an injury to his right hand,
but Miller is expected to recover
from a rib injury in time to play
a few more games this season.

The Baltimore Bees are loaded
with a host of big-name college
stars. Randy Walker was named
All-American second team last
year and Stuart Harrison was se-
lected to the third team in 1960.
Junior Kelz and Bobby Adair
both had previously played with
the Mount Washington Club of
Maryland for a few years. Mount
Washington is considered the best
team in the nation. Dryson Erhardt
was chosen to the All-American
first team two years ago as goalie.

Generals Take Lead

At the outset of the game the Gen-
erals were able to quickly score two
goals, jumping off to a 2-0 lead. Af-
ter the Bees tied the score at 2-2,
the Generals jumped ahead with a
third goal made by Charlie Gummey.
However, once the Bees tied the
score at 3-all, they were never
surpassed. At half time the score
was 8-3 and in the latter part of
the game the Bees upped their mar-
gin to 14 as the Generals added only
two more goals.

Despite the loss the Generals
played well. Their defense was con-
siderably improved over the previous

Phi Psi Still Holds 1st Place

Phi Kappa Psi still holds its first
place position in the intramurals
standing according to the latest fig-
ures released by the director of in-
tramural activities.

These figures include those for
the recent volleyball competition
in which Phi Gamma Delta cap-
tured first place with 100 points,
Phi Kappa Psi came in second
with 95 points and Beta Theta Pi
was third with 90 points.

The last intramural activities of
the year are softball which ends the
20th; table tennis, running from
April 24 to May 10, and Sigma Delta

games and they were able to pick
up ground balls much better. A
slight change in the defensive for-
mation helped things a little. The
Generals dropped one midfielder
back deeper into the defensive area.

Washington and Lee was handi-
capped also by the lack of substi-
tutes, as only 18 men dressed for
the game. As a result there was
a constant shifting of positions
throughout the contest.

Baltimore lost only two games
last year, to Army and Navy, the
nation’s number one and two teams
respectively. They are as yet unde-
feated in season play for 1961.

 

One sad note of the game was
Randy Wooten’s injury which ne-

cessitated his leaving the game be-
fore the first half. Wooten has
undergone an operation at Johns
Hopkins and will be out of ac-
tion for the remainder of the sea-
son.

Especially encouraging was the
fabulous play of Charlie Gummey
who scored 3 goals, and Jim Powers
and Wooten who each scored 1 goal.
Herb Tinley turned a fine perform-
ance at goalie with many saves.

Washington and Lee’s Generals
will travel to Chapel Hill this Friday
to play the University of North Car-
olina Tar Heels, and will play Duke
on Saturday at Durham. Last year
the Generals beat UNC by a 11-5
score and topped the Blue Devils
by a 13-3 count.

JC’s Honor Three W&L Athletes

In connection with the Valley
Fitness and Sports show held at VMI
weekend before last, the Lexington
Junior Chamber of Commerce pre-
sented six awards to athletes from
Washington and Lee and VMI. Two
of the awards for each school were
presented to the best athletes in the
school and the other award was
for the “unsung hero” in the school.

Those awarded these honors for
Washington and Lee were Steve
Suttle, for his fine performance as
W&L’'s star quarterback, and El-
liott Maynard, for the excellent
showing he made through the sea-
son and for his performance at the
Eastern NCAA meet.

Cited as the “unsung hero” of
the Generals was Roy Carpenter,
head of the Blue and White’s
pitching staff. Similar awards were
presented to VMI athletes.

Sam Huff, professional football star
and main attraction of the two day
show, presented the awards to Sut-
tle, Maynard and Carpenter in a

brief coremony before the opening

Responsible for selecting the re-

Trackmen Meet
Hornets After
Quantico Relays

By CLARENCE RENSHAW

Coach Norm Lord’s trackmen go
after their 12th straight victory over
a two-year span when they take
on the Lynchburg College squad
here Thursday at 3:45 p.m. at Wilson
Field.

The Generals will seek to ex-
tend their 1961 dual meet record
to 5-0 at the expense of Lynch-
burg after turning in commend-
able performances, but not placing
any men, in Friday’s and Saturday’s
Quantico Relays at Quantico, Va.

Quantico Relays

Sprinter Jim Hickey came closest
to making the finals of any event
when he was barely nosed out for
a qualifying position in the 100 yd.
dash.

In other events, the mile relay team

turned in a 3:32.0, their best time |i

of the year, but failed to place. Mike
Shank stuck it out in the 10,000
meter run for two complete miles,
doing it in his best time so far this

 

year.

Geology instructor Clarence Rob-
erts, former U.Va. pole vaulter who
is assisting Coach Lord in his
specialty, cleared the bar at a very
respectable 14’.

Frosh Top EHS

Mernwhile the Freshmen were
grinding out a 74 1/2 to 56 1/2 vic-
tory over Episcopal High School
here Friday in their first dual meet
of the season. Robin Kell, Skip Es-
sex, and Ed Croft did most of the
scoring for W&L and divided all of
the Brigadiers’ eight first places
among themselves.

Kell tripled in the hop-step-jump
(41’), the high jump (5’ 10”), and
the broad jump (20’). Essex won the
mile (4:58.0) and half-mile (2:06.8).
Croft took the honors in both hur-
dles events, the 120 yd. highs in
15.8 sec. and the 180 yd. lows in
21.4 sec.

The same three teamed with John
Pearson to win the mile relay.

It was only the third track loss
for EHS in the past two years.

The other W&L scorers were Dave
Britt, Ed Jansen, Rick Erickson,
and Henry Sackett.

The freshmen will try to make it
two in a row against Augusta Mili-
tary Academy here Friday at 3:45
p.m. on Wilson Field.

Track Coach Lord says W&L will
be represented also in the Virginia-
Pilot relays at Norfolk Saturday.

The Washington and Lee tennis!
team, a little shaky after the Spring
weekend, was defeated by Duke
University yesterday at Durham,
North Carolina by a score of 9 to 0.

The Generals, who now sport
a 3-2 record, were just not up to
their usual game as the Blue
Devils, who are now 6 and 5,
downed them on an extremely
windy day.

The best showing of the day for
the Generals came in the doubles

game, although he was not in usual

therefore, Duke was use to playing
a faster game. On the Generals’
courts it is difficult to serve and
rush the net because a player is
two steps slower on them than on
a harder surfaced court. For this
reason, the Blue Devils played a
diferent type game than that which
the Blue and White was used to.

Another handicap to the Gen-
erals was that it was only the
fifth match of the season compared
with the eleventh for the Duke
team. Duke has already played
half of its schedule which in-
cluded some of the most powerful
teams in the country. Three of the

N yaradi Calls
U.S. ‘Doomed’

By JACK ATWELL

“Gentlemen, your country and
your way of life are doomed.” These
words were among the first spoken
by Dr. Nicholas Nyaradi, a former
Hungarian Finance Minister, in an
address to a group of students and
professors in duPont Hall on Friday.

Dr. Nyaradi expressed the belief
that the Soviet Union will eventually
destroy the United States unless the
American people begin to recognize
the true nature of the Soviet threat
and understand the goals and tactics
of the Soviet leaders.

At present the director of the
School of International Studies at
Bradley University, Dr. Nyaradi
narrowly escaped from his native
country shortly before the 1947 Rus-
sian takeover in Hungary. During
World War II he fought in the un-
derground against the Nazis, and
after the war he went to Moscow to
negotiate for his government against
Soviet reparations claims. At this
time he came in close contact with
important Communists and was able
to form first-hand opinions of the
extent of the Soviet danger to the
West.

Dr. Nyaradi stressed the attitude
of relentless purpose which he ob-
served in the Kremlin. He warned
against the tendency of mistaking
Nikita Khrushchev for a “roly-poly
Ukrainian peasant” and against mis-
interpreting his ultimate goal which
is the destruction of the United
States and the victory of the uni-
versal Soviet state.

Dr. Nyaradi told his small audi-
ence that the idea of peaceful co-
existence and the catchword “Marx-
ism” are only Communists tools to
be used to confuse free men and to
veil the true Soviet aims.

That we need not perish and that
we can survive were Dr. Nyaradi’s
final points. He spoke optimistically
of the great moral potential of this
country and of the ability of the
United States to outdistance the
Soviet Union by a concentrated in-
dustrial effort.

However, he criticized the atti-

Notice

On Thursday evening, April 20,
the Radio Washington and Lee
program “Kaleidoscope” will pre-
sent a discussion of the student
referendum on the honor system
and student body constitution.
Present for the discussion will be
Kent Frazier, president of the stu-
dent body, and Greyfred Grey,
editor of the publication Protest
and one of the sponsors of the pro-
posed reform.

 

tudes of certain American corpora-
tions and unions and expressed pes-
simism about the indifference of
many American citizens and their|
unwillingness to face realistically the |
danger in which they live. Dr.
Nyaradi compared the courageous
character of a 15-year-old Hungar-
ian girl who used herself as a living
torch to blow up a Soviet tank dur-
ing the 1956 revolt to that of a young,
American “Elvis” fan.

Dr. Nyaradi’s message was sober-
ing and clear; in order to meet the
Communist threat every free man
must begin to think and act—now.

Frosh To Take Calculus

Washington and Lee’s math pro-
gram will be changed next year,
bringing the curriculum “more in
line with those of northeastern uni-
versities.”

Professor Felix P. Welsh, head of
the math department, has announced
that the freshman courses will em-
phasize calculus, rather than alge-
bra and trigonometry.

“We feel that calculus is much
more useful in applied science than
higher trigonometry and _ algebra.
Mathematics must be taught for its
usefulness, not as an end in itself.”

“There are almost as many theo-
ries on how math should be taught
as there are math teachers. This
curriculum, however, is more in line
with those of our northeastern com-
petitors.”

According to the new catalogue,
Mathematics 1-2 will consist of the
old mathematics 151 (calculus).

 

Tennis Team Plays Friday

five games that Duke have lost

cludes a big schedule as they travel
to Randolph-Macon on Friday, play
Virginia on Saturday, and complete
the weekend against a strong Coun-

mond on Sunday.

Baseball Team Loses
To Bridgewater Nine

Washington
team lost their third game of the
season last Friday when they fum-
bled away a 7-1 contest at Bridge-
water.

Bridgewater’s Eagles scored their
runs in bunches. They got two in
the first, one in the second, one in
the fifth, and three in the eighth.

The Generals’ lone run came in
the seventh, when Jim Russ walked,
was moved up to third, and came
home on the front end of a double
steal.

All told, the Generals could get’

only five hits off Eagle righthander
Tom Kincaid, who struck out 12
in posting his third straight victory.

Only three of the Eagle’s runs
were earned as the Generals com-
mitted five errors.

 

Offer Campaign Changes

(Continued from page 2)

overwhelming majority require can-
didates and parties to state their
stands in a formal announcement.

Party platforms are usually drawn
up and then individual candidates
from the party append their stand
on party issues. With our party
system’s organization, the adoption
of a platform might easily prove
difficult. The statement of belief
by individual candidates is now pos-
sible, however, and should be used
on this campus.

It seems almost futile to point out
that we do have a strong individual
responsibility in the government
policies here at W&L, but at the
same time it seems almost certain
that the freshmen that enter this
University feel this calling and want
to do something about it. Sooner or
later, depending on how well they
have been “assimilated,” they give
up these Platonic notions and crawl
back into their corner of the dorm.

Now is the time to reconsider this
situation. The people that are being
nominated for positions on the Exe-
cutive Committee are more than
qualified to speak effectively for
their point of view.

until 1933.

Following a short time as general
counsel for Internal Revenue Service
and corporation counsel for the Dis-
trict of Columbia, Judge Prettyman
helped establish the Washington law
firm of Hewes, Prettyman and Awalt,
conducting a general practice but
devoting special attention to admin-
istrative law. In 1945, President
Truman nominated him for District
of Columbia Circuit’s United States
Court of Appeals.

Judge Prettyman was chairman of
the President’s Conference on Ad-
ministrative Procedure, and he has
lectured often in this field. His
Dougherty lectures at the Univer-
sity of Virginia have been publish-
ed in book form under the title
Trial by Agency.

Judge Prettyman has been active
in community affairs, serving as
president of the Washington Board of
Trade and president of the Civitan
Club. For 15 years he lectured at
Georgetown University on tax law,
and in 1946 he received an honorary
degree from the institution. He is a
member of the American Bar Asso-
ciation and a former president of the
District of Columbia Bar Associa-
tion.
