he performs. Margo McClinton, who helped

the General Activities Board plan
the concert, said the incident was
not signiﬁcant enough to prevent
Rhymes’s performance Wednes-
day night.

“Even if you look at the case,
its not that big a deal,” she said.
“He”s coming, and it’s going to be
a great time.”

Rhymes, whose real name is
Trevor Smith, turned himself in
to the Manhattan police on Jan.
4. He was arrested and charged
with misdemeanor assault and
possession of knives and other
weapons.

A former bodyguard has ﬁled a

police report that claims Rhymes
hit him in the face when he came
to collect some money he was
owed.

Rhymes was released on $3 500
bail, but his lawyer told MTV.
com that the arrest was “payback”
for Rhymes ’s refusal to cooperate
with police in an assault case last
August.

In that incident, police accused
Rhymes of kicking a man in the
head for spitting on his car. Police
later found a machete in the back-
seat of Rhymes’s car, but, accord-
ing to Rhymes’s lawyer, it was a
fake machete used in the rapper’s
show.

Rhymes is the one of the big-
gest acts brought in by GAB. Mc-
Clinton said that the group was
“kind of shocked” when they
found out they had booked him.

She said the group felt as
though they were in “a little over
our heads,” but she credits the

students involved with stepping
up to prepare for the big perfor-
mance.

John Allgood, who has led the
operation to book Rhymes, said
that everyone in the committee
has a job to do to pull everything
together.

“There are about a hundred
different things that have to be
done,” he said. “It’s a group ef-
fort.”

The show, which is expected
to sell out Wednesday, has already
received a big response from the
community.

A facebook ﬂyer has helped
get the word out. McClinton said
she has even heard from local
high school students who want to
attend.

McClinton said that the genre
change may be the major attrac-
tion for most students, who, she

oet speaks on King

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

A daylong celebration of Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. ‘s life concludes
tonight with a speech in Lee Cha-
pel by poet Sonia Sanchez.

Sanchez, who has written
more than a dozen books of poet-
ry, will speak at 7:30 p.m. There
will be a candlelight march from
Lee Chapel to Evans Hall after
her speech.

Onyx Vice President Yvonne
Coker said the Martin Luther
King Day planning committee
was impressed with Sanchez‘s ac-
complishments.

“We chose her because of her
reputation within the Civil Rights
Movement,” Coker said, “and her
association with the black arts
movement.”

Other members of the selec-
tion committee included Onyx
President Cherrelle Moser, Qui-
ana McKenzie of the Multicul-
tural Student Association, E”Lon

Cohen of the Joyful Noise gospel
choir, Associate Dean of Students
Tamara Futrell, and English pro-
fessor Laura Brodie.

Sanchez, a native of Birming-

_ ham, Alabama, was born Wilsonia

Benita Driver. She spent nearly
30 years in Harlem before mov-
ing to Philadelphia and teaching
at Temple University from 1976-
1999. She earned the 1985 Amer-
ican Book Award for her book
“homegirls & handgrenades.”

Sanchez has written about sex-
ism, child abuse, and class con-
flicts. She often abandons formal
English and writes in American
black speech patterns.

Coker said Onyx and the MSA
were trying to organize a commu-
nity-oriented event for people of
all ages.

“We want to bring the W&L,
VMI, Lexington and even Rock-
bridge County communities to-
gether,” Coker said.

To further involve the local
community, Brodie worked with

Futrell to organize a birthday
party for Dr. King. The party
was held this aﬁemoon in the
Commons. Brodie advertised the
event in local elementary and pre-
schools.

“The idea for an event came
about from a group of community
members, not just W&L folks,”
Brodie said. “Mostly it was par-
ents wondering what to do with

our kids on this day.”
Though Brodie originally
planned to host a small party, the

event was switched to the Com-
mons at the invitation of Futrell,
who said W&L had both the re-
sources and the space.

“We want young children to
be introduced to Dr. King and the
Civil Rights movement,” Brodie
said.

The party featured games and
face painting organized by W&L
students. It also, of course, had
cake and ice cream.

Cyndi Atkins organized a po-
etry writing contest for middle

Speech by Sonia Sanchez caps a day of celebration and reflection

school students. Atkins is a mem-
ber of the English Department at
Roanoke College and serves as the
artistic director of the local Writ-
ers at Jordan House program.

Brodie said the contest was
aimed at middle school students
because Atkins thought most pro-
grams were focused on elemen-
tary or high school students.

95 area middle school students
entered the contest, and three stu-
dents were selected to read their
poems before Sanchez ’s speech.
Brodie said some local teachers
made the contest part of a class-
room assignment.

This evening’s program will
involve more than just Sanchez ’s
speech and the poetry reading. A
concert by Joyful Noise and Afri-
can drumming are also planned.

Coker said she hopes Sanchez
will share her memories of King.

“We’re interested in hearing
her perspective of the Civil Rights
movements and [how it relates] to
Dr. King’s legacy.”

Saddam Hussein:
dangerous dead

Saddam is trial, execution screw-ups increase instability

By cody Beauchamp
C 0 L U M N l S T

I have a disturbing feeling
that Saddam Hussein had the last
laugh.

Sure, he’s dead, executed by
his enemies for the crime of mass
murder. But in his trial and now
execution, he may have gotten the
death he wanted.

First, there was the travesty of
his trial. To put it bluntly, the new
Iraqi government dropped the ball
lobbed to it by America.

In December 2003, the Pro-
vincial Authority made a poor
decision when they decided to let
the Iraqis try Hussein.

Certainly the people of Iraq de-
served to see the man be brought
to justice. They also deserved to
take part in that justice.

But the judiciary set up by the
new Iraqi government is untested
at best and a downright mess at
worst.

Throughout the trial, legal
scholars and experts worldwide
couldn’t help but agree with
Hussein’s claims that his trial was
fundamentally unjust.

Multiple lawyers were killed
by insurgents attempting to dis-
rupt the trial.

The ﬁrst chief judge, Rizgar

interference.

More lawyers were killed.

It was the kind of shabby af-
fair that would be declared a mis-
trial and retried had it occurred
in aUnited States court and had
it occurred to anyone not named
Saddam Hussein.

The problem with all of this
isn’t that Hussein never had a
chance of escaping conviction.

The more the execution looked like
a lynching, the more ammunition is
given to the myth of Saddam.

He was a dead man from the
moment the U.S. declared war on
him.

Had he somehow been acquit-
ted of the charges of his “Dujail
Trial,” he would have most assur-
edly been convicted in his “Anfal
Trial.”

If not with that trial, then any
of the numerous other trials that
could have been brought against
him for torturing and killing his
own people for decades.

The problem is, the fact that
the trial wasn’t done on the up-
and-up undermines the Iraqi gov-
emment’s legitimacy.

To many Sunnis, it made the
Shiite-controlled government
look incapable of being just.

This is the kind of sentiment
that will only feed the sectarian
violence that is keeping Iraq from
stability.

The Shiite and Kurd-ﬁlled
Iraqi court system should have
called the trial for what it was—a
farce—and retried Hussein.

They should haveshown the;

world that they weren’t out for re-
venge for the decades of mistreat-
ment under Hussein by taking
their time and doing it right.

But they didn’t.

The execution
botched.

If you have the stomach, check
out the videos of Hussein’s hang-
ing.

And with the exception of one
outburst (in which he cursed the
“Persians,” his Iranian enemies
from the Iraqflran War), Hussein,
to his credit, looked digniﬁed and
calm.

The aura he maintained
throughout the affair actually—
somewhat disturbingly—evokes
sympathy.

If you could somehow Photo-
shop the face of a black man onto
Hussein’s, you would think the
video was of a K lynching.

For shame.

The more the execution looked
like a lynching, the more ammu-
nition is given to the myth of Sad-
dam Hussein.

There is a dangerous amount
of room to view him as a martyr,
something that is dangerous for
Iraq’s stability.

Surmi extremists can now
ﬁght on in the insurgency, sadly,
with even more tenacity, believ-

Shiite government is incapable of
actually dispensing fair justice.
Hussein most likely believed
until his last moment alive that he
was still the true leader of Iraq. He
would have loved nothing more
than to see the new Iraqi govern-
ment’s legitimacy questioned.
Thanks to the botched job, the
lynching-esque air of his execu-
tion, Saddam got that last laugh.

Rush: Thank goodness it’s
over.

Everyone hates it, and now
we can all get back to our
lives.

In the past week, people
have pushed themselves to
the limit both physically and
emotionally, just to make this
momentous Greek event go
off without a hitch—which,
by the way, it never does-
and for what?

Some people risked it all,
really putting themselves out
there, just to be rejected. Oth-
ers put in investment-banking
hours to help decorate, orga-
nize and plan each night.

Sure, rush can be very ex-
citing, particularly because
for many, it decides which let-
ters you will wear for the rest
of your college career (if not
your life).

Last week, friendships
were both forged and de-
stroyed, all because of these
long-running traditions that
so determine our way of un-

ffeditorial

The week from
hell is finished

With bids and balls, our identities are forged

derstanding the social envi-
ronment at this university.

People turned their backs
on their actual friends in order
to better afﬁliate themselves
with Greek ones. People
took it personally when their
friends didn’t choose their
Greek organizations.

The organizations are
meant to build bonds. But
oﬁen they destroy more than
they build.

And to what does all of this
stress, all of this lost sleep and
all of this pain amount?

A social structure that ex-
cludes more than it includes,
divides more than it unites
and, in general, perpetuates
stereotypes so much that the
casual use of them is accept-
able, if not expected, in every-
day conversation.

It has become so imprinted
firm-t.1_1_.<=.,.,.i.<l,<:i1,t,i_ty.,9t”. the,,school
and its students that its de-
struction is unthinkable—we
can’t live without it. We for-
get, when we arrive on cam-
pus, everything we’ve ever
learned about accepting and

appreciating our differences.

We put up boundaries
that determine where we will
eat lunch, throw parties, and
sleep.

We decide, in the ﬁrst year
of college, with whom we will
be friends for the rest of our
college careers. This doesn’t
mean that we don’t associ-
ate with people outside of
our Greek organizations, or
that we wouldn’t have been
friends with our pledge class-
es anyway. It just means that
we have resigned ourselves to
a group, an identity, to which
we will be tied for four years
or more.

In our search for self, we
become so desperate to ﬁnd
a categorical identity that we
assign ourselves to a group,
regardless of its reputation.
And in one tumultuous week,
we sift through ideas about
who we think we are and how
we want to be identiﬁed and
then make a decision.

We are deﬁned, in many
ways, by this one week. Thank
goodness it’s over.

have three distinct choices,

and I’m not. talking about
what I eat. I’m talking about
who I eat with. Why?

I could eat at what my friend
calls the “black community
table.” I could eat with my “in-
ternational friends,” usually in
the back table on the stage. I
could eat with one of the many
predominately or entirely white
cliques that I happen to be
friends with.

Of course this is not always
the case. Some people in these
groups I just mentioned regular-
ly eat with people from the other
groups, but that’s an exception,
not the rule. Why?

Does this seem ﬁne to every-
one else? It doesn’t to me. I was
just able to divide the dinning
hall by race.

That’s what they called seg-
regation.

name of King came around,
dining halls like ours were seg-
regated, and it was condoned by
the government. Now we have
what I call “chosen segrega-
tion.”

Now it’s us, the people, who
choose to segregate ourselves.
I’m not blaming the white stu-
dents. I’m not blaming the black
students. I just want to know
why.

Why is it that I have to
choose?

They have told me it’s like
this everywhere. My college
friends say their high schools
were “diverse” but students
tended to keep to “their own
kind.” It’s not like this every-

 

where though. That wasn’t the
case where I’m from.

Back home, my choice of
who I ate with had nothing to
do with what someone looked
like or where they were from.
My lunch table back then had
people with every skin pigment
known to man.

I’m not going to pretend we
were colorblind. There were
race jokes, but we were com-
fortable enough to have them
without getting offended.

We proved we weren’t racist
by embracing our differences
and still not letting them divide
us. We were all proud of who
we were and sure enough of
ourselves to not need to be sur-
round by people who were just
like us.

That’s not the case here, and
I don’t get why. Why do I see
plenty of tables of just guys and
plenty of just girls, as if we were
in kindergarten and we thought
the other sex had cooties?

Why do I rarely see people
of different Greek organizations
sit together? Why is that I could
say there is such thing as a black
table and a white table?

I don’t have answers, just
questions. I expect we all need
to come up with the answers.

‘Seriously, what was the point
of the civil rights movement?
What’s the point in W&L be-
coming co—ed if we still treat
the other sex completely differ-
ently? What’s the point in W&L
recruiting minority students if
they’re going to be segregated,
or segregate themselves?

Why do we bother? Does it
just look nice to say we have
women, we have minorities,
we have international students,
even if everyone just “sticks to
their own kind?”

There is a reason why W&L
wants to be diverse. Being ex-
posed to diversity makes us
more culturally aware, more
well-rounded, and, yes, more
intelligent.

It not only gives us a sense of
what’s around us but of who we
truly are.

Boundaries like segregation
don’t keep other people out.
They fence you in. Do we really
want to be fenced?

I hear my class is doing a bet-
ter job of desegregating. From
what I’ve seen, freshman tables
aren’t as monochromatic as the
rest. So we have hope.

So I want everyone who
reads this, everyone who has the
same problem I do with chosen
segregation, to sit at a table you
wouldn’t normally sit at next
time you got to d-hall. Why
not?

Leaders serve nation

Bonner students pledge to complete 900 hours of community service for partial tuition scholarship

By Jessica Shaw
ARTS 3. LIFE EDITOR

A number of Washington and
Lee students actively participate
each semester in service efforts
to better the surrounding commu-
nity. Even the most ambitious stu-
dent, however, struggles balanc-
ing studies, social life, athletics,
work and community service.

A Bonner Leader program has
been implemented on campus to
aid those ambitious students who
have a passion for bettering the
world.

Currently, there are 22 W&L
Bonner Leaders on this campus
who have committed themselves
to two full years of service. These
students underwent a rigorous
application process and have
pledged to complete 900 hours of
volunteer work in these two years.
On December, 13 new Bonner
Leaders were appointed.

“I am very busy, but I was very
attracted to the aspect and the idea
that Bonner Leaders were about
individuals who wanted to take
the time out of their schedules to
better themselves through serving
others,” sophomore Grace An-
drews said.

Because of the time com-
mitment, a scholarship has been
awarded to these individuals to
replace time that may have been
dedicated to a part-t‘i_1_jr.'pi_e: job.;A1c‘-

‘cording to Bonner Leader Pro-

gram Director Dr. Sandra Hays-
lette, W&L provides $2000, and
AmeriCorps, the non-proﬁt or-
ganization that helps fund tuition
scholarships, gives each student
$2300 after the completion of the
900 hours.

“It’s often hard for students
who have a lot of other obliga-
tions in their schedule to ﬁnd time
for service, especially if they are
involved in work study,” Hays-
lette said.

“A strong, steady commit to
service where you’re at the same
agency for a long haul is so trans-
formative.”

Bonner Leaders have a lot of
freedom in choosing the type of
organization they want to volun-
teer with. Andrews said she wants
to take advantage of her foreign
language skills when she is doing
service.

“I want to work somewhere

where I could utilize my Span-
ish,” she said. “I really want to
work with immigrants and refu-
gees. That’s a way to have a glob-
al focus but work domestically. I
want to specialize in the women
and children as well, because
those are the immigrants who
usually come.”

Sophomore Aisha Davis said
she would also like to assist wom-
en and children.

“I would like to help women
and children because as a whole,
they seem to have the least amount
of assistance,” Davis said. “I feel
like women and children have a
harder time with securing a stable
1ife.”

Davis also said she had an in-
terest in working with the elderly.

“I think that as a society,
Americans mistreat their elderly,”
she said. “If we can’t organize
ourselves together to help out
people who have put their lives
into this country, I don’t really
see too bright of a future for our
country.” '

According to Hayslette, even
though the interview process is
quite strenuous, the variety of tal-
ents and personalities that a Bon-
ner Leader displays are diverse.

“I think we are looking for
people who seem ready for chal-
lenge, who seem ready to take on
that project of ﬁnding a way to
make ‘a lasting diﬂ'erenc’e,j’ Hay-“
s1é‘tté'sai'd‘."  ' ' "

“They already caught the bug.
They already know that doing
community service is transforma-
tive for themselves, and it’s ad-
dictive.”

Hayslette emphasized the
diﬁerence between temporary
volunteer work and the Bonner
Leader program. She said that
these students are learning about
themselves and how they can be
forces for permanent change in
society.

“You do help other people,”
Andrews said. “That is the goal,
but I think it’s also about the ex-
periences and what you can leam
from them. I think that a lot of
times, people approach volunteer
work and service in the manner
that they are going to help them,
as if these people need you. But I
think what Bonner is trying to do
is to create a relationship where
both parties need each other.”

This tournament was a great

Washington and Jefferson had
defeated the Generals last week,
so this tournament was proved to
be sweet revenge for the Gener-

while the Generals ﬁnished third.

Boniello said that one of the
Generals great strengths was their
experience.

“The past two years we were
considered a very young team.
We mainly had the current junior
year class. Now we have a full
line up of freshmen and sopho-

experience is one of our greatest
strengths.”

Men take HolidayTitle

While most Washington &
Lee students spent their holiday
breaks far from campus, the Gen-
erals men’s basketball team wel-
comed three teams to the Warner
Center for the W&L Tournament.
Since winning that event deci-
sively with victories over King’s
Point and Emory, the Generals
have continued their up-and-
down season. They now stand at
7-4, having lost at Roanoke 68-64
on the 6“‘ of January and defeated
Bridgewater 81-74 on the road
one week later.

The team’s recent success has
been lead by junior forward Greg
Bienemann, who has notched
at least 13 points in every game
this year and has lead the team in
scoring and rebounding in their
last ﬁve games. Bienemann was
named Most Valuable Player of

®ToYoTA I moving forward > ® 

the W&L Tournament for his im-
pressive displays against King’s
Point (14 points, 6 rebounds) and
Emory (28 points, 11-of-14 from
the ﬂoor).

Though Bienemann’s per-
formances have stood out, the
team’s play as a whole has risen
since losing to Virginia Wesleyan
on the 3"" of December. Since
then, the Generals are 4-1, with
the game at Roanoke their only
loss. That contest was a back-
and-forth affair, featuring poor
shooting from both teams. Roa-
noke was paced by Curtis Peery,
whose double-double (18 points,
12 rebounds) helped the Maroons
make up a 10-point deﬁcit in the
last four minutes of the ﬁrst half.
The lead continued to change
hands in the second half, until
Roanoke pulled ahead 60-56 with
ninety seconds left. From then,
the Generals were forced to foul
to stop the clock, and Roanoke’s

     

success at the charity stripe (26 of
39) proved decisive.

Against Bridgewater it was the
Generals whose shooting proved
superior. They hit 27 of 41 shots
from the ﬁeld. Again led by Bi-
enemann (26 points, six rebounds)
and fellow junior forward Femi
Kusimo (21 points, a career high),
the Generals never trailed in the
game. The Eagles did make it
close in the fourth quarter but the
Generals, like Roanoke a week
before, were deadly from the foul

line in the clutch, making 9 of 12
in the ﬁnal 1:51 of play to seal the
victory. The win over the Eagles
snapped a 21-game losing streak
in ODAC road games, a string of
losses dating back to February of
2004.

This week the Generals will
try to continue their recent suc-
cess against ODAC opposi-
tion, hosting Emory & Henry on
Wednesday before traveling to the
second-ranked Hampden-Sydney
Tigers at the week’s end.

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team placed third out of
eight teams at the W&L Tourna-
ment held on Saturday at the War-
ner Center.

Muhlenberg won the team title
with 86 points, followed by Johns
Hopkins with 77.5 points, and
W&L with 75.5 points.

The Generals were very
pleased with their performance.
Junior wrestler Anthony Boni-
ello said,“As a team we wrestled
very well. We were only a couple
points behind ﬁrst place. The
competition has deﬁnitely gone
up since last year.”

Three Generals won their
weight classes, while two lost in
the championship match of their

weight classes.

Junior Adam Hockensmith
was very pleased with the team’s
performance at the tournament.
He said, “l thought we wrestled
well. We could have wrestled bet-
ter. Sam Brusca really stepped up.
He was down in his match, and he
came back with a really good chin
whip and pinned his guy.”

Freshman Sam Brusca was
undefeated going 2-0 overall
to win the championship in the
125-pound weight class. Brusca
pinned Muhlenberg’s Mike Te-
nenhaus in the championship
match, 4:28 into the match.

Hockensmith added, “[Brus-
ca’s victory’] was a big win for
the team.”

Junior 165-pounder Anthony
Boniello also went 2-0 overall
to capture the title in his weight

class. Boniello downed Scran-
ton’s Steve Tatum in the ﬁnals of
the 165-pound weight class by a
score of 3-1.

Junior Jesse Sataloff claimed
the championship of the 174-

The Washington and Lee
women’s basketball team won
two ODAC contests over the
weekend, besting Lynchburg Col-
lege on Friday evening and Ran-
dolph-Macon Women’s College
on Saturday afternoon.

On Friday, the Generals ended
a six-game losing streak with
a 76-68 overtime victory over
Lynchburg College.

Lynchburg had a two point ad-
vantage at halftime, and then held
a 40-32 lead with less then 14

minutes remaining in regulation.
However, the Generals countered
with an 18-2 run over the next
ﬁve minutes to take a 50-42 lead
with a little over nine minutes re-
maining.

W&L held the lead for nearly
the remainder of regulation time,
until Lynchburg nailed a three-
pointer with 10 seconds left to
tie the game at 62-62. The extra
session belonged to the Generals
from the start as senior forward
Jessica Hunsinger gave W&L the
lead on a lay-up just 35 seconds
into overtime. The Generals never

trailed again.

The Generals were paced by

junior forward Kristen Krouchick,
who notched a season-high 20
points and grabbed a career-high
13 rebounds. Sophomore guard
Bethany Ridenhour posted a
career-high 20 points and four
assists, and junior guard Em-
ily Wolff contributed 13 points.
Hunsinger added 10 points, seven
rebounds, four blocks and three
steals.

The Generals then set a school
record when they grabbed 75 re-
bounds, including 41 offensive
boards, in defeating Randolph-
Macon Women’s College 73-49
on Saturday afternoon.

The Generals broke the game
open with a 16-6 run midway
through the ﬁrst quarter which
helped them to take a 10-point
lead into the break. The lead re-
mained at 10 points with a little
over 12 minutes left in the game,
but another W&L run, this time a
21-4 spurt over 10 minutes gave
the Generals a commanding 27-

point lead with two minutes left
in the game.

W&L had a 75-21 overall ad-
vantage in rebounds and had three Q
players record a double-double in
points and rebounds. Freshman
center Kaitlyn Kamp led the way
with career-highs in both points
and rebounds. Kamp notched 15
points and added 13 rebounds.
Krouchick tallied 14 points and
10 boards, while Hunsinger
had 10 points and 13 rebounds.
Ridenhour was a ’fourth Gener-
als to score double ﬁgures as she
accounted for 10 points and six
rebounds.

The Generals have had a great
start to their season, behind the .
strong play of Krouchick and
Hunsinger. They have also had
great contributions from Riden-
hour and Wolff.

Washington and Lee improved
their record to 5-7 overall. Wash-
ington and Lee returns to action
on Tuesday as it hosts Randolph-
Macon for a 7:00 pm contest at
the Warner Center.
