Kitchen kicks

Volunteers provide comfort to
Rockbridge s underprivileged

By Dane Davis
STAFF WRITER

ith a goal of serv-
ing 200 meals a
week to local resi-

dents, the Campus Kitchen
project got underway last
Thursday.

The kickoff event, held in
Evans Hall, featured a variety of
speakers and guests who came to
celebrate the opening of the new
chapter.

Dr. Harlan Beckley, director of
the Washington and Lee’s Shep-
herd Poverty Program, began
the event by explaining W&L’s
groundbreaking role in service
and poverty education.

The program then shifted to
theorigins of Campus Kitchen
at W&L. Senior Maggie Puryear
explained how Ingrid Easton,
a member of the class of 2005,
was moved by the poverty she
witnessed through the Shepherd
Poverty Program. After an intem—
ship at the D.C. Central Kitchen,
Easton was compelled to do
something here at W&L. She met
with various officials and was
given permission to start a Cam-
pus Kitchen chapter on campus.

Following Easton’s story,
University President Ken Ruscio
spoke on the importance of Cam-
pus Kitchen as a student governed
and supported organization.

Tom Petty, a 1983 W&L Law
School graduate and chairman
of D.C. Central Kitchen, and
Abby Flottemesch, Development
& Communications Manager
for Campus Kitchen, spoke af-
ter President Ruscio and offered
their comments on poverty and
the Campus Kitchen program.

The event concluded with an
Iron Chef-style cook off involv-
ing students and faculty. Dishes
included balsamic green bean
salad, summer chicken salad and
graham cracker pudding pie.

Campus Kitchen traces its
roots back to the non-proﬁt D.C.
Central Kitchen. Founded by
Robert Egger, the D.C. Central
Kitchen recycled the food sur-
pluses of the Washington, D.C.
area by collecting and serving the
unused food.

The success of D.C. Central
Kitchen’s efforts led two students
from Wake Forest University to
pilot a similar program.

Eventually the two methods
collided to form a student run or-
ganization emulating the model of

the
D.C.
Cen-
tral
Kitch-
en. The
new pro-

gram, named Cam- pus
Kitchen, has quickly expanded to
incorporate ten universities and
one high school. Campus Kitchen
has provided more than 360,000
meals since its inception in 2001.

Campus Kitchen goes beyond
simply distributing meals. The
organization’s motto “Teach.
Reach. Feed. Lead.” exempliﬁes
the different approach Campus
Kitchen takes.

Campus Kitchen focuses on
the individual and his or her need
for love, affection and friendship.
Volunteers who deliver the food
spend time talking with those
who receive the meals.

This challenges students’ per-
ceptions of poverty and encour-
ages them to see the poor as in-

dividuals not so different from
themselves. Participants cite this
personalized attention to the poor
as a main reason for joining.

Alice Shih, an intern at Cam-
pus Kitchen, said, “Working in the
Shepherd Poverty concentration,
I have always been very inter-
ested in integrating what I learned
with volunteering operations. In
addition, Campus Kitchen has a
holistic approach to eliminating
hunger and poverty in our com-
munity. I am very excited to work
with the entire community, not
just Washington and Lee.”

One key feature to the Campus
Kitchen outlook is the idea that
the one of the causes of poverty--a
lack of j ob skills--must be rectiﬁed
for poverty to come to an end. Ac-

Bookstore battles costs

As the cost of textbooks spirals higher and

higher with each passing year, University

Bookstore managers Bill and Maureen Becker

work to help students watch the bottom line

By Kate Shellnutt
STAFF WRITER

The university bookstore ex-
panded its return policy this year,
requiring students to provide doc-
umentation of schedule changes
when exchanging books.

The policy changes came
about aﬁer the store’s c0-direc-
tors, Bill and Maureen Becker,
noticed some students ordered
their textbooks online, purchased
the same ones books at the book-
store and then returned them once
the books they ordered arrived.

“That’s taking a book away
from someone else,” said Mau-
reen Becker, “so it messes with
our numbers.”

The new policy went into ef-
fect this summer and regulated
returns through September 13, the
last day to return textbooks.

The Beckers do not see online
book-buying as a threat. It has
not yet had noticeable effects on
the store’s business, as the Uni-
versity Bookstore continues to
sell over 20,000 textbooks each

term. While they encourage stu-
dents to support the school’s store,
they understand the incentives for
comparison-shopping online.

“I’ve bought books on Ama-
zon myself,” said Maureen.
“Sometimes you can get a good
deal. But you have to make sure
the book is the right one and in
the right condition, and that it
will arrive in time. Most students
would rather not go through that
hassle.”

For those that would, she says
the bookstore employees are will-
ing to help students ﬁnd lntema-
tional Standard Book Numbers,
or ISBNs, so they may be ordered
online. Bookstore policy does not
prohibit students from recording
these numbers.

_ The Beckers, like hundreds
of others running campus book-
stores, have noticed the skyrock-
eting textbook prices over the
last ten years. As the parents
of a W&L alumnus, the couple
also had to pay the pricey bill for
books at one time, too.

W&L is not subject to Virginia

laws that aim to control the cost
of textbooks.

Since the Beckers took over
bookstore management two years
ago, they have acted to combat
publishers’ rising prices, from
working within the store and with
faculty.

What the bookstore can do
to limit costs:

Sell used books. Used books
cost 25 percent less than new
ones. In the past two years, the
number of used books sold in the
W&L bookstore has grown by 50
percent.

Talk to deans and faculty. By
encouraging faculty to submit
book lists early, the bookstore’s
textbook manager, Brenda Reese,
can find the materials on the lists
for cheaper prices.

What professors can do to
limit costs:

Use the “old” edition. Publish-
ers often market a book’s latest
edition, even if changes to it are
minimal. If these changes are not
necessary and a professor can use
an old edition two years in a row,
the bookstore can guarantee more
used copies and cheaper prices.
Such was the case with Econ 101
books this fall.

Check for hidden extras. On-
line materials, CD-ROMS, or
workbooks may not be used in the
class, so professors can choose a
more basic “bundle.”

Add up the costs. Sometimes,
professors do not look at the total

  Amazon forces new bookstore return policy, but not much else

costs of their course materials.
With coursepacks and a stack of
textbooks, the price may grow to
be unreasonable.

What students can to do
limit costs:

Give feedback. If you were
required to buy materials that
were not used enough, or worse,
were not used at all, let your pro-
fessor know how you feel. He or
she may reconsider whether or
not to require it the next term.

Sell books back. By selling
your books back at the end of
the term, you are putting more
used books on the shelves for
the following term.

Even if the book you sold
back ends up in Wisconsin, the
total number of books bought
back helps the store earn more
used ones.

Double check prices and
shop around. Inadvertent over-
charges had Professor Suzanne
Keen’s English 355 class paying
a total of$12.50 more for four of
its paperback novels. The book-
store is refunding the difference
between the cover price and the
overcharges.

Keen tries to keep in mind
the ﬁnancial burden of the texts
she assigns--up to 12 each se-
mester--because of her academic
discipline.

She, like other professors,
posts booklists online so stu-
dents can buy them before they
reach campus.

cordingly,
Campus
Kitchen has
a job-training
program that
teaches the re-
cipients of its aid
how to become
trained chefs. Cam-
pus Kitchen works
with the newly trained
chefs to secure them em-
ployment. Since the program’s
founding, 67 people have been
given the skills necessary to enter
the work environment. Campus
Kitchen also works with local
mothers to educate them in nutri-
tional skills.

Despite being relatively new,
W&L’s chapter is already busy
reaching out to the community
and collecting food. W&L’s Cam-
pus Kitchen is targeting local or-
ganizations such as Habitat for
Humanity to be recipients for the
food.

A campus-wide food drive
has gathered over 1,100 pounds

of food goods and is still receiv- _

ing donations. The organization
looks to serve 200 to 250 meals
per week with and expected ex-

pansion to 400 meals per week.
Campus Kitchen’s partnership
with the Elrod Commons Mar-
ketplace allows the program to
collect excess food not eaten by
W&L students. Campus Kitchen
continues to be student-run, but it
is dependent on the entire W&L
body for continued success.

Everyone, even those not en-
rolled with the Shepherd Poverty
Program, can be involved. Posi-
tions include two hour cooking
shifts three days a week, two hour
delivery shifts three days a week
and every day twenty minute food
pickups.

Busy schedule? Not a prob-
lem.

Caitlin Schopp, Campus
Kitchen Coordinator for W&L,
says that students can come in at
any time, as long as they send an
e-mail or phone call beforehand.
Campus Kitchen is not an obliga-
tion for students who want to get
involved, but rather an opportu-
nity.

Located in the Beta House,
Campus Kitchen’s doors are al-
ways open to anyone willing to
lend an extra hand.

Raiding the
EC’s wallet

Clubs hope to strike it rich during
the annual handout of E C funds

By Sacha Raab
snxrr warren

Nearly every student on Wash-
ington and Lee’s campus is a
member of at least one club or
organization.

Without sufficient funding
from the Executive Committee,
however, these groups would not
be able to exist.

In order to receive funding
from the committee, each group
needs to be officially recognized
as a club.

To receive this designation,
the group ﬁlls out a form explain-
ing its philosophy and why it is a
beneﬁcial addition to campus or-
ganizations.

The forms are then returned to
the EC. Once official, the group
applies to receive money from the
committee.

The president and vice-presi-
dent of the committee then review
the list of groups and estimate
how much ﬁnancing each group
needs.

They take into consideration
how much money was spent by
each club in past years and each
club’s success.

The president and vice presi-
dent then deliver their estimates
to the EC, which then discusses

each proposal and decides on an
appropriate distribution of funds.

The responsibility of an orga-
nization is a major factor in de-
termining how much money that
organization will receive.

Considering that the EC is us-
ing parents’ money to fund these
various clubs, it is important to
know exactly how the money is
used.

When a group approaches the
committee, it must already have
a solid idea of how much money
they need and have speciﬁc ac-
tivities either in mind or already
planned.

The organization must be le-
gitimate, with a decent amount of
interest and goals.

Tye Haeberle, EC vice presi-
dent, said, “The higher the stakes,
the more legitimate they [the
clubs] have to be.”

When considering whether to
accept a new club or how much
to fund an existing club, the com-
mittee focuses on underclassmen
interest. This way, they can ensure
that the club will remain existent,
and hopefully popular.

Haeberle also said that each
organization is responsible for
itself. “The EC can’t babysit the

  W&L goes nuclear

Professor Frank Settle examines the future of nuclear energy

Washington and Lee and the Council on For-

eign Relations team up to study the future of

nuclear energy, addressing issues of climate

change, energy security, terrorism, nuclear

proliferation and radioactive waste disposal

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

The prestigious Council on
Foreign Relations will join Wash-
ington and Lee this year to discuss
the future of nuclear energy.

W&L Professor Frank Settle
will represent the University in
collaboration with Dr. Charles
Ferguson of the Washington-
based Council in producing a spe-
cial report to Congress slated to
be published in January of 2007.

Settle said that he hopes the
project--entitled “The Nuclear
Energy Project”--will “provide
information and opinions that will
stimulate discussion on the future
of nuclear power.”

He said that not many Ameri-
cans, even members of Congress,
are very well-educated
nuclear issues. He has high hopes
that the report will “get the atten-
tion of the higher education com-
munity” especially.

When discussing what speciﬁc
areas the project hopes to address,
Dr. Ferguson said, “the project
should examine what contribu-
tion nuclear energy can make to
alleviating climate change...and

about _

contributing to energy security...”

He also listed nuclear prolif-
eration, terrorism, reactor safety
and radioactive waste disposoal
as areas he would like to see ex-
amined.

Ferguson explained that the
report’s release date was selected
speciﬁcally to coincide with the
start of the 2007 Congressional
session.

Said Ferguson, “I would hope
that the report will educate Con-
gress about the importance of
controlling global warming and
the role that nuclear energy could
have in contributing to solving
that challenge...Congress will
have to think carefully about the
long term implications of favor-
ing one source [of energy] over
another.”

Settle said that discussing the
long-term use of nuclear energy
sources is especially important
now because “Right now about
20 percent of our national energy

pressing questions of economic
feasibility and safety currently
surrounding nuclear power.

“The big issues are economic,
such as ‘are people really going
to invest in this?’... [And] safe-
ty. One bad accident at a nuclear
power plant anywhere in the
world will kill nuclear power,”
said Settle.

Additionally, Settle noted that
the report will spend some time
addressing nuclear energy as a
threat, because “anytime you have
a nuclear power plant, you have
the potential to produce weapons-
grade material.”

In conjunction with the report
to Congress, the project will also
host seminars and round tables on
nuclear issues, two of which will
be held in Lexington.

Ferguson also plans on writ-
ing a book examining the use of
nuclear energy in the U.S. and
abroad, while Settle will be teach-
ing a course that “will address the
role of nuclear energy in provid-
ing power for our future power

needs,” for the Spring 2007 term.

Settle and the Council on For-
eign Relations are recieving fund-
ing from The H.F. Gerry Lenfest
Foundation as well as the Cam-
egie Corporation, the Lounsberry
Foundation and the MacArthur
Foundation.

Lenfest is the W&L alumnus
who also donated $3 million to-
wards the construction of the
Lenfest Center for the Arts.

Settle and Ferguson share high
hopes that the Project will be
successful in provoking thought
about the future of nuclear en-
ergy, especially, Ferguson said,
because both organizations “bring
strong credentials to the project.”

“I believe this project will
stand out,” said Ferguson. “The
Council has a reputation as a truly
nonpartisan think tank. Washing-
ton and Lee has a reputation as
one of the leading institutions of
higher learning.”

He believes both groups will
beneﬁt as they examine nuclear
energy and its future.

Haeberle said the
groups should be respon-
sible about having backup
money sources so as not
to completely rely on the
Committee’s funding.

The Office of Student
Activities, run by James
Dick, will begin to help
ﬁnance club sports, so that
the groups have an addi-
tional source of income and
do not have to rely on the
EC for all of their funding.

Certain groups have re-
ceived more money some
years than they have in oth-
ers.

Some clubs receive
more money with their pro-
posals because they need
it, and others because they
earn it.

Often, a group can get
more ﬁmding by demon-
strating its importance to
the community.

Groups demonstrate
their role in the community
through service and student
involvement.

Why must W&L is so—called ladies and gentlemen become clﬁerent people after the sun goes down?

By Cody Beauchamp

COLUMNIST

“Hooking up.”

After drinking and Vineyard
Vines, it’s the Washington and
Lee vice of choice. I regularly
hear the boasts of some guy in-

tent on “scoring” (or some other,

far more unprintable term) with
“babe X.”

Men rib each other about the
“fly honeys” they admire. It is
such a part of the atmosphere here

that it rivals the speaking tradition

and an appreciation for Traveller
as part of our communal charac-

ter.

And it’s wrong in almost every
way.

Don’t misunderstand me--the
sexual revolution has come (no
pun intended). If you want to
“rock the Casbah,” you can, fre-
quently so, and with virtually no
social criticism to boot.

lt’s not the idea of hooking up
at W&L that is troublesome--it’s’

the execution.

Men are looking at sex all the
wrong way. Worse yet, women
are allowing them. Sex for the av-
erage man more resembles foot-

ball than feelings—-hooking up is

all about putting up big numbers.
And that is precisely the prob-
lem.

Sex is (cliche as it sounds) a

very emotional experience. Even
when the hook-up is late night
and courtesy of Messers. Natty
and Jack, there is still emotion
invested. The investment may be
one-sided or slight, but pretend-
ing it is not present is naive.

Yet the attitude allowed to pre-
vail is that sex is so commonplace

that it barely registers outside

of locker room-esque bravado.
Sex means nothing, or at least it
should mean nothing. It is easy. It
is cheap.

And that perception is wrong.

To the dismay of this writer,
men bear most of the blame. When
a man stops seeing a hook-up as a
pleasant surprise and starts seeing
it as an entitlement, he robs the
woman of her dignity.

Even though social pressures
dictate that women here should
want to have sex, what they do
with their bodies (and whom they
allow to do those things) is still a
very personal and important deci-
sion. But this is not the message
many men send women night in/
night out.

Men have quit caring about
personality, about whether his
partner is fun or exciting. We see
hooking up as something that is
out of her control.

It’s not a mutual choice. It’s a
game of coercion.

For the boorish man simply

Men are looking at sex all the wrong way. 

Sex for the average man more resembles foot-

ball than feelings — hooking up is all about put-

ting up big numbers.

looking to score, this is a spectac-
ular arrangement. But it smacks
of just that--boorishness. It does
not reflect well on our fratemi-
ties, our school, or our gender en
masse.

Again, do not misunderstand
me--if a cavalier lifestyle with
multiple partners is your desire,
there is arguably nothing wrong
with that. ' _

But when this lifestyle is cou-
pled with a predatory mindset,
you quit being a gentleman and
start being a reason to hate sex.
Men who hook up with no regard
for what the woman takes from it
are making hook-ups look bad.
This is how feelings get hurt and
reputations get ruined.

In the most extreme cases, this
is how rape is born. This attitude
robs sex of its fun and tums it into
something regrettable. The sexu-
ally active students of this school
should hold themselves to higher

standards.

Gentlemen, we must quit
looking at women as objects. It’s
degrading and chauvinistic. It re-
ﬂects poorly upon each one of us
and is wholly unattractive.

If you have an eye for a certain
girl, ﬁne. But respect her enough
to at least talk to her before the
Beirut table runs dry and Travel-
ler is making its last run. Get to
know her. (You may end up lik-
ing her for more than just looks.
Gasp!)

The bottom line--make it a
choice for her. Because it is her
choice, never yours.

Ladies--ﬁnd the gentlemen.

You’ll know them, they’re the
ones that can make you laugh be-
fore you’ve lost some ﬂip-cup.

They hold the door and still
talk to you the morning aﬁer (ide-
ally the moming before).

They will be discreet and make
sure you take something good

away from the experience.

They will opt not to have sex
when it’s clear you have had too
much and‘ can’t really decide
wisely. They will respect your
boundaries and take “no” to mean
no.

Don’t want to go all the way?
They will accept that. They make
it about you as well as themselves.
They make it fun, not regrettable.

’ By the way, ladies, here’s a lit-
tle trick to see just how interested
he really is: “Here’s my number.
Call me tomorrow.” Wait until
you can actually make a good de-
cision. It could save you a world
of awkward regrets.

Besides, it takes courage to hit
on a girl when she has all her nor-
mal inhibitions--trust me. What
woman wants a coward?

Now I’m sure that by now in
the school year many of us are

uncomfortably straddling the
line between gentlemen and cad,
lady and loose woman. Many of
us have already made some deci-
sions we regret. But this should
not keep us from resolving to
change. No matter how uncom-
fortable it may be to take stock of
your actions, the need is pressing-
—especially for gentlemen. What’s
done is done, and for what it’s
worth we can all say it together:
mea culpa. We still need to turn
our thoughts towards the future.

We hold ourselves to high
standards here at W&L. We self-
police ourselves so that none are
allowed to break our communal
trust. And yet we don’t seem to
hold ourselves to any standards of
civility at night.

Why not? Why is the “sketchy
hook-up” still an acceptable part
of W&L’s social life?

Wall Won’t WOI'k

Minutemen want to stop them, but they ’re already here

By Abel S. Delgado
co LUM msr

Here’s to the Minutemen.
Yours is truly a dying breed. You
represent all that America once
was and is now slowly but surely
refusing to be. The racism, the
nativism, the ignorance: it’s all
yours and one day it will all be
gone.

You patrol the borders to keep
“illegals” out. Never mind that
probably less than a century ago,
it was your ancestors who came
here illegally.

You talk of laws to stop im-
migration. Never mind that it was
your ancestors who either bene-
ﬁted from the ﬂoodgate immigra-
tion of Europeans into our great
country or were devastated when
those ﬂoodgates were closed.

You look at our border with
Mexico with disgust. Never mind
that you look at Ellis Island with
admiration. You talk of America
as the “Land of the Free.” Never
mind that you want to deny others
that freedom.

Now, you want a wall. Never
mind history. If you read the Bi-
ble, you would know that since
the time of Jericho, walls haven’t
worked.

Did the Great Wall of China
stop the Mongol invasion?

And what about the Berlin
Wall? Didn’t everyone’s favor-
ite conservative president, Ron-
ald’ Reagan, demand it be taken
down?

Wasn’t the Berlin Wall similar
in ﬁmction to a wall on our bor-
der, keeping those in a less suc-
cessful country out of a prosper-

ous one? Isn’t it a political tool
that separates families?

What do you think Reagan, if
he were alive, would say about
your wall? Do you think he would
join you with your riﬂes “patrol-
ling the border?”

The real reason you patrol
those borders is out of fear. No,
not of terrorists. You would be
patrolling the Canadian border,
where the Sept. 11 hijackers en-
tered the country, if terrorism was
your real worry.

Not of drugs either. If that
were the case then you wouldn’t
consume so many drugs.

And you don’t fear most of the
people crossing it to cam a decent
wage either. You don’t fear the
one who mows your lawn, the
one who valets your car, or the
one who cashiers at the fast food
restaurant you frequently visit.
You don’t fear all those unskilled
low-wage earning workers who
help keep prices down and social
security aﬂoat.

The truth is you fear me, the
ﬁrst generation American. You
fear that I am alongside your son
at a competitive college, not be-
cause of afﬂrmative action, but
because my grades were the same,
and we get along great.

You fear that I will one day
work alongside your daughter at
a successful job, and it will help
me that I am bilingual. You fear
that one day I will take my place
in your government.

You fear our generation.
You fear our buying power, our
changes to pop-culture, our “his-
panization of American culture.”
You fear the Shakira poster on
your son’s wall and the Enrique
Iglesias lyrics coming from your
daughter’s lips in a language you
refuse to understand. You fear
turning on the television and see-
ing more than one channel with
that language. You fear showing
up to the polls one day and having
to vote for someone whose name
you can’t even pronounce.

So you patrol the borders,
you lobby for stricter laws, and
you may even build a wall. But
it’s too late. I’m in here already.
We’re in here already. This is my
country as much as it is yours. I
am as a big a patriot as you are,
if not more, because I will never
take my freedom for granted. This
is our country, the land of the free,
land that is open, land of all.

Long live the Minutemen, as a
testament to what America once
was and never again will be.

Stop whining
about drinking

If students want change, they should make it

We’ve heard a lot of whin-
ing in the past two weeks.

Campus-wide, students are
complaining about the state’s
new hard line on underage
drinking -- and Lexington’s
tough enforcement of the new
policies.

The Pole Houses were
rocked by the Rockbridge
County sheriffs last weekend
when they came into a party
to check identiﬁcation.

Students have been picked
up walking away from par-
ties, buying food at Stop-In
and waiting for rides.

Law enforcement officials
are sending the message:
don’t drink underage.

This puts quite a cramp in
the side of our traditional uni-
versity social life.

Instead of drowning our
sorrows in a case of cheap
beer, why not actually do
something?

The students that go to
this school seem to be at least
relatively bright people.

We get good grades
while we’re here. We have a
widely respected school of

commerce, economics and
politics. We have a powerful
graduate law program.

On an even more basic
level, we know people. Our
parents and alumni are mov-
ers and shakers.

And yet we’d rather go on
letting this happen.

Complaining about get-
ting in trouble for drinking
underage -- an illegal activity
-- is ridiculous.

It’s a waste of time.

Usually you can get away
with it.

But when you get caught,
it’s hard to call yourself a
victim.

There was a time when
students cared enough about
the way they were treated by
the outside world.

Students in Germany
started a revolution that
eventually changed the lan-
guage itself.

Here in the United States,
students worked together to
get the voting age lowered
to 18.

You’re competent enough
to decide on the leader of the

free world, but not enough to
have a glass of wine at din-
ner?

Only South Korea, Japan
and Iceland have drinking
ages over 18.

Only the United States
has one over 21.

We know the facts. We’ve
had the arguments.

We even have the resourc-
es.

With all of this on our
side, what keeps the student
body generally apathetic to
something so inﬂuential to
our lifestyles?

What is particularly dis-
turbing is how personal this
argument could get.

Legislators get tougher
each year.

Police get more aggres-
sive in their enforcement
tactics.

But we can’t blame the
police. They’re just enforc-
ing the laws.

We have the intelligence.
We have political clout.

Don’t sit back and whine
about how it’s so unfair.

Make something happen.

Contentious
play not porn

Tits & Blood a metaphor for powerful women

By Sarah Kientz
STAFF WRITER

A million and a half tickets
sold. There were 28,014 different
performances of 1,864 plays in
261 theaters in 22 days. Welcome
to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe,
where Washington and Lee stu-
dents performed Neil LaBute’s
“Tits & Blood.”

Over the summer, theater stu-
dents traveled to Scotland to per-
form before hundreds of people
at the largest arts festival in the
world.

Theater director Tom Ander-
son said the performance was
well-received in Edinburgh.

“It was really successful on
an artistic and creative level be-
cause the company did such great
work,” Anderson said.

Junior Libby Moore, a mem-
ber of the theater company, said
audiences in Edinburgh either
loved or hated the play.

“We’d much rather have peo-
ple be passionate about it no mat-
ter what,” Moore said. “No one «
leaves the theater indiﬂ°erent, and
as long as no one thinks it’s just
ok, then l’ll be happy.”

Moore said one of the hardest
parts of the experience was re-
ceiving bad reviews from critics.

“It was really taxing having
to deal with reviewers who hated

the show and said that we’ll end

up working in the porn industry,”
Moore said.

Only one of the negative re-
views attacked the actors, Ander-
son said. He dismissed the review,
saying it was written by “one of
those guys who would have at-
tacked God.”

As in the W&L community,
Moore said the name of the play
caused a stir overseas.

“There was many an audience
member in Edinburgh who was
disappointed that this is not a strip
show,” Moore said. “There’s no
actual tits and blood in the show,
which is very disappointing.”

Anderson said the play’s de-
ceiving title was originally a joke.
Neil LaBute, professional play-
wright and friend of Anderson,
wrote the play with the original
title “The Dyad: Two Scenes of
Contention,” but added jokingly
that they could work together to
come up with something catchier,
like “Tits & Blood.” As time went
by, LaBute became more serious
about the title, and asked for it to
be changed, Anderson said.

“At this point we’d already sent
copies of the script to the festival,
and had to call to ask if we could
change the title,” Anderson said.
“The festival was excited about it
because it would be more conten-
tious and sell more tickets.”

The new title worked won-
ders, as “Tits & Blood” became

the most recognized name in Ed-
inburgh, Anderson said.

“We had the most successful
ad campaign at the festival,” An-
derson said.

However, the title was not ar-
bitrary, Anderson said.

“The play’s about dark
thoughts, violence and powerful
women who seek revenge and
sexual potency,” Anderson said.
“There’s a metaphor here about
control and women in possession
of their own lives.”

Because of the controversial
content, the company worried
about how the play would be re-
ceived at home, junior Lauren
Sapikowski said.

“We’re used to performing it
for actors and directors and the
theater community,” Sapikowski
said, “so I’m worried about how
the W&L community will react
to it.”

“I like that the audience was
involved,” sophomore Kate Corr
said. “It was unique.”

Sophomore Kiki Moreo said
she continued to think about the
play even after she left the the-
ater.

“I liked the play. It was really
different from my expectations,”
Moreo said. “The point was to
think about it aﬁerward and I deﬁ-
nitely did,” she said.

“I thought about it for the rest
of the day.”

Peace cranes for 9/ :11.

W&L remembered the five year anniversary of the terrorist attacks with several
events, including an origami table sponsored by PAACE. The group taught other
students how to make cranes, a symbol of world peace. Prayers, discussions
and film showings were all part of the campus tribute to those who died.

 

Wilson Hall tuned to students’ need

Long due ﬁne arts building shows oﬁ’ new technology

By Abri Nelson
STAFF WRITER

Wilson Hall blends into the
Lenfest Center so well that it is
diﬂicult from the outside to dis-
cern how different the two build-
ings look from the inside.

But as soon as students step
through the connecting doorways,
they can see the difference.

“People’s jaws are dropping
when they come into this space.
It’s so big!” said music professor
Tim Gaylard.

Now that the theater, art, mu-
sic and dance departments are all
in the same building, it is much
easier for them to collaborate on
such projects as the annual spring
term musical, which started last
year.

“I love Wilson Hall,” said
junior Lauren Sapikowski. “It
is so beautiful, it feels open and
free! Now I feel like I’m going
into a studio as opposed to walk-
ing into a cave to go to all my art
classes.”

Wilson Hall boasts seemingly
endless improvements, including

a performance hall speciﬁcally
tuned for musical performance,
practice rooms that dampen out-
side sound, a photography studio,
a design computer lab, a print-
making studio and ‘-‘smart class-
rooms” with special technology
for studying music and art.

Senior Sam Wilmoth said, “It
is hard for me to express how ex-
cited I am that the university has
made such a wonderful invest-
ment...My only regret is that I
only get to spend one year using
Wilson Hall.”

While some of the more ad-

vanced studios are closed to stu-
dents not enrolled in arts classes
because of the expensive equip-
ment they contain, the majority of
Wilson Hall is open to the entire
student body with the hopes of
making the building a place where
students can study and relax, like
the Elrod Commons.

Students like Sapikowski also
feel safer in Wilson Hall because
a university card is required for
access to the building at night.

This makes it easier for all stu-
dents to study and practice after
hours.

Both Sapikowski and Wilmoth
expressed hope that the student
body, especially those not cur-

rently involved in the arts, would
take advantage of the new build-
ing, whether by coming to enjoy
the varied types of perfonnances
or by enrolling in classes.

“I know so many people who
have graduated without setting a
foot in Lenfest,” said Sapikowski.
“Students should try to branch
out. I hope to see more students
coming to a variety of produc-
tions.”

For Spice, the best part of the
new building was the ﬁrst day of
classes.

“It came alive and you could
hear students’ voices,” he said. “I
thought, this is what the building
is all about.”

Soccer meets goal

Men destroy all lcompetition, look to improve preseason third place ranking

By Mike Huntress
STAFF WRITER

After an impressive 5-1 with
against Marymount Saturday
evening, Washington and Lee’s
men’s soccer team moved to 4-0,
the ﬁrst time since 2000 they have
been able to boast such a record.

That was also the last year they
won the ODAC conference tour-
nament, after ﬁnishing with an
18-1 record (8-1 in conference).

While it’s too early to start
projecting whether or not they can
repeat that feat, the Generals have
looked strong so far, outscoring
opponents 19-2, the fewest goals
yielded by any team in the ‘ODAC
this season.

While they have yet to play
a conference game, their season
opening win against Southern Vir-
ginia University is noteworthy.

After losing to the Knights last
year, the Generals “had a point
to prove,” according to assistant
coach Michael Piranian.

They did just that in the ﬁfty-
fourth minute when junior mid-
ﬁelder Josh Dodds scored the
lone goal of the contest.

The only other close game of
the year was a 2-1 win over Cath-

olic University, in which goals

were scored by seniors Kyle Gar--

cia and Rhett McCraw.

That’s going to be a trend with
the Generals this year: reliance on
senior experience. W&L’s six se-
niors make up the core of what is
a mature, veteran team.

“It’s their leadership and ex-
perience that will bring everyone
together. They’re the gel that will

‘make ‘us successful,” said Pira-

nian.

Every starter is a returner from
last year’s team, which is why
Piranian’s comment, “We hope to
exceed last year’s record (of 9-6-
2),” is a bit of an understatement.

The Generals’ strength is in
its defense, where the entire back
line possesses captain status. (Not
that the offense lacks punch.)
Blueﬁeld can attest to that after
an 11-0 drubbing at Watt Field on
Thursday.

Notables up front include Gar--
cia and junior Jack Palmer. Garcia

has made three shots on goal and_

has contributed three assists.
Palmer boasts seven shots on
goal and ﬁve points for the Gen-
erals. ,

had to score, players gave much
of the credit to opportunities pre-

For most of the game, Martin was
covered by Sewanee comerbacks
AJ Johnson and Fred Rhodes,
both of whom are 6 feet tall.
Martin’s lone touchdown re-
ception of the game was a ball
thrown high by Dawkins, relying
on Martin’s height and athletic
ability to out-jump the comer-
back covering him, which he ef-

fectively did. _ I

The game was also the univer-
sity’s annual Hall of Fame induc-
tion ceremony. At halftime, four
W&L athletes were honored for
their athletic achievements, in-
cluding star tennis player Marilyn
Baker ’95, the only woman in his-
tory to win three ODAC Player of
the Year awards in tennis.

record to 2-1.

 

have high expectations for him...
Kyle Garcia is a senior who’s a
leader on and off the ﬁeld,” Pira-
nian said. .

The Generals also get contri-
butions from its youngest mem-
bers, with Piranian saying, “some
freshman might crack the lineup,”
before the season’s end.

In particular, freshman Drew
Crowley has contributed one point
and one assist for the Generals in
the game against Blueﬁeld last
Thursday.

But the focus is clearly on the
here and now. The Generals gear
up for the start of conference play
on Tuesday when they take on
Bridgewater.

The Eagles were picked to ﬁn-
ish ﬁﬁh in the ODAC preseason

poll (W&L was picked third be-
hind only Virginia Wesleyan and
Roanoke) and have compiled a 2-
2 record so far this season.

“ODAC is a very competitive
schedule for us, every game is
tough,” Piranian said.

_ The Generals’ acid test will
occur on Oct. 14 when Virginia
Wesleyan, currently 6-1, rolls
into Watt Field, two weeks before
the start of the conference touma-
ment.

With expected solid play up to
that point and a win on Oct. 14, it
then may be time to start drawing
comparisons to that 2000 champi-y
onship team.

After facing the Eagles at home
on Tuesday, the Generals travel to
Hampden-Sydney on Saturday.

Freshman voices
football frustration

Huntress disappointed at lack of spirit
and attendance at ﬁrst home game

By Mike Huntress
STAFF WRITER

I have attended sporting events
shirtless, with blue paint slowly
cracking as it dries on my chest,
shorts stained with beer from the
drunken slob next to me, drib-
bling blue sweat from every pore
from ﬁghting through the throng
of people. I
have peed on
the side of a
parking ga-
rage because
the line for
the bathroom
was too long,
and seen peo-
ple emerge
bloodied
from the
rush to get to
the parking
garage and “beat the traffic” (this
last one may be a slight exag-
geration, but in New York, it’s not
much of one). This is my.image of
watching football, where the fans
are to be commended as warriors
of equal merit as the players on
the ﬁeld.

So imagine my cultural ad-
justment when I stared into the
stands this Saturday and saw a
wall of seersucker, pastels, and
Sunday dresses. I had been brac-
ing myself for it for a few days
now, told by everyone that this
is the way it would be, but still
I was shocked to be staring at
something that looked like a liv-
ing Georges Seurat painting with
way too much pink in it. Not that
I wasn’t prepared. I myself was
wearing a pink button down shirt,
khakis, and a pink tie. Not being
able to tie a tie, it’s the same one
I’ve worn to every formal func-
tion since I came to school with
it pre-tied, although I am yet yo
digest the idea of football as a
“fo_rrnal function.”

I also realize that the football
game itself was a mere footnote
to most people. For students it
was an excuse to starting drink-
ing at 11 o’clock (maybe the only
way watching the game would be
tolerable for them.) For the many

alumni I saw strolling around the
campus, it was a day to drag their
family around and talk about the
good old days while their children
feign interest. In those respects,
the day was a raging success.

I admittedly came to the game‘
late, missing the entire ﬁrst quar-
ter and most of the second. There
are about seven minutes left be-
fore halftime. I take my place in
the collage of color on the rust-
colored benches which reek of
neglect (odd, because everything
else here is so immaculate--they
obviously don’t plan on having
people spend a lot of time there)

‘and watch as Sewanee quarter-

back throws an interception. I
have seen plays like this elsewhere
excite fans to such a frenzy that
you question their mentally sta-
bility. Here, among the sea of pas-
tels, is a smattering of applause,
some cheers, and what I call the
golf clap (when one hand rests
motionless and the other gingerly
taps the ﬁrst with just the ﬁnger-
tips, which I guess is a showing of
high cultured restraint).

As halftime rolls around, the
pastels drain from the stands in a
mass exodus, which is the norm
at sporting events--just not at
halftime. I join the river of color
that’s ﬁling out down the bridge,
but not before looking back and
wondering how I feel about vio-
lating the savage principals of
sports fanship I had lived by in
my previous life. The only people
left it seems are adults, probably
many alumni, who stare placidly
at the ﬁeld, as the cheerleaders try
in vain to stir up excitement.

Notice I haven’t yet mentioned
the score, or even that the Gener-
als won. I honestly didn’t know
the result until that evening when
I looked it up online. No one even
mentioned it in passing, which
seems to be ﬁne with just about
everyone here. What’s important
is the, sum of the rituals that makes
the event part of a culture. What’s
important is every one is nicely
dressed and that everyone enjoys
tailgating and the post-game par-
ties. And in those respects, the
day was a raging success.

Another may be the impres-

Rubenstein, who replaced four-
year starter Courtney Harrison.
The team also boasts an impres-
sive group of underclassmen

Garson. Garson was awarded the
2005 ODAC Rookie of the Year
(the ﬁrst to be so named in W&L
history).

With all this impressive array
of talent, the most important com-
ponent of the continued success
may be head coach Wendy Orri-
son. Orrison was named Coach of
the Year last year.

gets excited about practices and
playing for her.”

Practices began the week be-
fore freshman orientation and in-
cluded a week of two-a-days be-
fore going to the regular two-hour
practices of the season. Practice is
held either on the W&L turf ﬁeld
or one of the grass ﬁelds.

“We have lots of random wann-
ups and team bonding exercises,”
Rubenstein said. The purpose of
these is to to enhance team uni-
ty and add an element of fun to
practice. Keeping a positive at-
titude seems to be a hallmark of
Coach Orrison’s program.

Men ﬁnish third, women secure ﬁfth at Saturday is N Y U Invitational

A nine-hour bus ride began
the weekend for the men’s and
women’s cross-country teams as
they traveled to New York City to
compete in the New York Univer-
sity Invitational.

The Generals made a strong
statement as the men plowed for-
ward to a third place ﬁnish, and

the women secured

( w 5 For the third
of 28 consecutive year,

the men’s team has
placed in the top three at this in-
vitational.

Men competed against 34
schools including ODAC oppo-
nents Lynchburg College and Vir-
ginia Wesleyan College.

Amassing 193 points, the men
ﬁnished behind Johns Hopkins
University with 88 points and
NYU with 33. Battling for third,
the Generals edged out competi-
tion from Rowan University (195
points) and Adelphi University
(201 points). Lynchburg posted a
sixth place ﬁnish.

The men were led by top ﬁn-
isher, sophomore Michael Welsh,

teams. We won last year, so we
know what it feels like to win and
the upperclassmen try to keep that
tradition going,” Rubenstein said.

Another tradition involved
in the spirit of team is the short
game. Rather than giving the ball
to the best player and letting that
player carry the team, the offense
utilizes a short game with lots
of passes and communication to
set up the shots. This strategy is
helped by good recruitment that
allows the team to ﬁeld a deep
bench.

“I think the biggest strength of
the team right now is the depth of
our bench,” junior Kendall Korte
said. “We have a really great team
dynamic.”

Over the weekend, the team

“This was my ﬁrst meet in
season,” Welsh said. “It’s a good
opening performance. I didn’t feel
my best, but I still ran well.”

Welsh was trailed by sopho-
more Vance Berry, who came
thirty-second, recording a time
of 28239. Junior Andrew Friski
placed forty-second (28:57) fol-
lowed closely by junior cap-
tain Tom Brower in forty-ﬁﬁh
(29:02). Freshmen Ben Stutts and
Elliot O’Brien battled for posi-
tion ﬁnishing one second apart
at ﬁfty-sixth and ﬁfty-seventh re-
spectively.

The women were powered by
sophomore ODAC Rookie and
Runner of the Year (2005) Jackie
Burns, who surged to a third place
ﬁnish in a pool of 262 athletes.
Burns posted a time of 19:33, just
six seconds behind the second
place runner from the University
of Findlay.

“It was exciting,” Burns said.
“You never know how it’s going
to work out. You never know if
people have gone out too fast or if
they can hold the pace. We were
switching places back and forth.
There was a pack of us. When we

Macon.. The Generals prevailed
over Randolph-Macon 6-2, but
fell in the second game to Mc-
Daniel 0-1. Hampering the team’s
efforts this weekend were a hand
injury that forced Hatchett to sit,
and a hostile surface: grass.

Field hockey accentuates the
differences between surfaces more
than other sports since the ball is
rolled along the ground. Most
of the away games are played
on grass, while home games are
played on turf.

“Turf is faster and more pre-
dictable, and it can take a lot to
adjust to grass,” said Rubenstein.

were close to both Catholic Uni-
versity (176 points) and Adelphi
(169 points). Findlay ﬁnished ﬁrst
with 40 points followed by Johns
Hopkins with 78.

Of the top seven ﬁnishers for
the women, ﬁve were freshmen.
Dorothy Todd placed twenty-third
in 21 :01 followed by Mary Fran-
ces Weatherly who ﬁnished thir-
ty-ninth in 21:26. Annie Kasper
secured ﬁﬁieth place with a time
of 21 :40, and Elizabeth Krausnick
ﬁnished sixty-third in 22:14.

According to Brower, this
course requires a good deal of
strategy in order to perform well.

“I ran it three times in high
school for Regionals, and this is
my second time running the 8k
course, so I’ve got a lot of ex-
perience,” he said. “I think it’s
a very challenging course. It re-
wards people who arepatient and
who know how to approach the
course.”

According to head coach John
Tucker, Washington and Lee
boasts one of the most rigorous
cross-country courses in Virginia.

“It is an advantage for us to
train and race on it,” he said.
“When we get used to running on
ours, everything else is a little bit
easier for us.”

Tucker also said the team per-

formed well, especially after the
heavy training last week.

“We’re training hard these
weeks, and we’re not giving them
a lot of rest,” he said. “We have to
progress through the season, and
the end of the season is when we
are going to back off. We’re train-
ing through meets.”

O’Brien, who has completed
three marathons post-high school,
said the training has been success-
ful for numerous reasons.

“I [deﬁnitely think] the train-
ing we have been doing lately
has been building as much men-
tal touglmess as it has physical,”
O’Brien said.

In the past year, the men have
lost stars Nathan Johnson (’O5)
and Alex Mahoney (’08). Ac-
cording to Tucker, the team has
adjusted well.

“Not having Alex and Nathan
means we’ve got to step up some-
where,” he said. “The people who
have stepped into those roles have
been freshmen. While we may not
have low numbers at this point at
least so far, what we do have, is a
tighter pack. That’s how you win
races--is to have a pack.”

The men and women look to
continue their success this Satur-
day in the Roanoke Invitational.

Volleyball

After its ﬁrst loss to Chris-
topher Newport on Friday
(3-1), the Generals’ volley-
ball team retaliated with full
force to defeat Virginia Wes-
leyan on Saturday morning
3-1. On Friday, the Captains
posted scores of 30-17, 28-
30, 30-26, 30-25 to defeat
the Generals. On Saturday,
the Generals outplayed the
Marlins 30-21, 22-30, 30-28,
30-25. The Generals have
posted a ﬂawless ODAC
record thus far and look to
continue that streak as they
face Guilford College on the
road Wednesday at 7 p.m.

Field Hockey

After a stellar start to its
season, the ﬁeld hockey
team fell to McDaniel Col-
lege yesterday 1-0. Junior
goal keeper Tara Ruben-
stein posted three saves. So
far, the team has defeated
Rhodes College (2-1), Cen-
tre College (1-0) and ODAC
competition Randolph-Ma-
con College (6-2). The team
looks to getter its record as
it hosts its first game this
Friday against Catholic Uni-
versity at 6 p.m.

Men’s Soccer

The men remain undefeated
this season after winning
their ﬁrst four games. Most
recently, they ﬁnished in a
deﬁnitive win over Mary-
mount (5-1) last Saturday.
The team has also defeated
Southern Virginia University
(1-0), Catholic University
(2-1) and Blueﬁeld College
(11-0). Junior J ack Palmer
has scored ﬁve of the Gen-
erals’ 19 goals including a
hat trick in the game against
Blueﬁeld last Thursday.

Women's Soccer

The women’s team shares
the incredible success of the
men’s team recently defeat-
ing ODAC competition Ran-
dolph-Macon College 7-0 on
Saturday. Junior Shana Olt-
mans and sophomore Anne
Van Devender contributed
two goals a piece. Overall,
the women have posted a
season record of 4-0. The
women have defeated teams
from Kenyon College (2-0),
Southwestern University (4-
0) and ODAC competition
Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College (11-0). Notable
players have been goal keep-
er Kiki Moreo with seven to-
tal saves and Van Devender
with seven points.

Football

The football team achieved
its ﬁrst win this season at the
ﬁrst home game last Satur-
day against Sewanee. Senior
quarterback Hunter Dawkins
threw 15 for 19 and 159
yards, and sophomore run-
ningback Stuart Sitterson ‘
rushed for 73 yards and one
touch down. The Generals’
defense, led by junior line-
backer Ryan MacPhee, only
allowed one Tiger touch-
down.

Football makes
comeback after
ﬁrst game defeat

One week after a disappoint-
ing loss to Franklin and Marshall
in its season opener, the Washing-
ton and Lee football team won
its ﬁrst home game 21-7 over the
Sewanee Tigers in front of a vocal
crowd of 1,725.

The Generals’ defense held the
Tigers to a mere 216 yards of total
offense and forced four turnovers.
The result was especially impor-
tant because of last week’s difﬁ-
cult loss to F&M in

the start of the year, behind only
Bridgewater College, currently
ranked tenth in the nation, most
observers expected the Generals
to win through their early games
until their encounter with the
Eagles in Bridgewater on October
28.

While both of their games thus
far were non-conference, and thus
do not affect the ODAC champi-
onship race, players said the loss
was tough all the same, and that it
was important to get a victory in
front of the home fans.

Offensive lineman Charlie
Craigle said that the team didn’t
know exactly what to expect from
F &M, but that afterwards the
Generals thought they could have
pulled out a win.

The Generals’ performance
was less than spectacular against
F&M, and players were looking
for a change in the team’s attitude
before coming back to Lexington
to open their ﬁrst home game.
Against F &M, the team managed
only 128 yards of offense and 11
ﬁrst downs, an overall lackluster
showing from a team coming off
its best season in twenty years.

Women is soccer team shuts out every contender posting ﬂawless record of 4-0

The Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team has gotten
off to an outstanding start to this
2006 campaign, starting off with
a 4-0 record, while outscoring op-
ponents 24-0.

With victories over two ODAC
conference opponents, the Gener-
als sit poised to make another run
at the ODAC championship. Al-
though the season is only just be-
ginning, W&L slammed ODAC
opponents Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College and Randolph-
Macon by scores of 11-0 and 7-0
respectively.

The Generals have been led
by sophomore forward Anne Van
Devender. Van Devender has
been a force to be reckoned with
on the offensive side of the ﬁeld,
leading the team in scoring with
seven goals and three assists. Van
Devender was also named MVP
of the recent W&L Invitation
tournament held at the start of
September.

“I think we are off to a great
start,” Van Devender said. “We
are starting games stronger and
scoring early goals.”

portive home crowd, the Gener-
als captured the win they thought
they should have had at F&M.
W&L’s offense rarely mis-
ﬁred, and the defense was solid
against a Sewanee offense loaded
with dangerous playmakers like
tailback Blake Mears, named
Southern Collegiate Athletic
Conference Player of the Week
two weeks ago in Sewanee’s 42-
35 win over Hampden-Sydney. In
that game, Mears had 149 yards
rushing. Against the Generals, he
was held to just 49. The offense’s
performance was also markedly

In this past weekend’s con-
test against Randolph-Macon,
the Generals dominated. W&L
was led by junior forward Shana
Oltman’s and Van Devender, who
both tallied a pair of goals.

Junior forward Martha
Caulkins started the Generals’
offensive with her fourth goal of
the season. Senior forward Anne
Wiltshire also tallied a goal and
two assists in the contest.

Caulkins has been stellar for
the Generals, also notching a hat
trick with an assist in the Generals
11-0 victory over Randolph-Ma-
con’s Woman’s College. Caulkins
is the second lead scorer for the
Generals this season with four
goals and an assist on the season
for far.

better, totaling 251 total yards as
opposed to the 128 against F&M.

Key to the Generals’ improve-
ment was the play and leader-
ship of senior quarterback Hunter
Dawkins.

“After the F&M loss, Dawkins
realized he needed to be more of
a leader,” said freshman Malcolm
Hines. “He stepped up and we got
the win”.

In addition to Dawkins’ per-
formance, the Generals’ offense
was paced by impressive play by
senior wide receiver Colton Ward
(5 receptions, 76 yards, I touch-

forward Cara Burton have also
been big factors in the Gener-
als offense. Wiltshire has scored
a goal and notched three assists.
Wiltshire ranks second all-time at
W&L in goals scored (43), third
all-time in career points (104) and
ﬁfth all-time with 18 career as-
sists. Burton has scored a pair of
goals on the season so far.

The Generals are a young
team, only having graduated
three seniors in the off-season.
Some freshmen are already mak-
ing a strong impact. Roz Klann
and Maggie Sutherland have both
seen lots of playing time, and
both have scored their ﬁrst colle-
giate goals.

While the Sewanee offense
was able to gain yardage on the
Generals’ defense, they were un-

one senior last year, this year’s
defense is unstoppable. For the
start of the season, the Gener-
als have been perfect, posting
four consecutive shutouts.

Senior midﬁelder Maggie
Megear and junior defender
Haley Bunting have led the
defense for the Generals. Both
were all-ODAC selections last
season.

Goalkeeping duties have
been split by two returning
stars, senior veteran Em-
ily Binns and sophomore Kiki
Moreo. Moreo has seen more
playing time, but both athletes
have done outstanding in goal,
not allowing a single goal.

Just four games into the
season, the Generals seem pre-
pared to take on any opponent.

The ladies are off to a great
start and are prepared to take
on conference rivals in pursuit
of an ODAC championship.
The team last won the champi-
onship in 2003.

I think we will continue to
have success,” Van Devender
said. “Virginia Wesleyan this
Saturday will be a real test.”
