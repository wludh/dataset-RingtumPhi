Virginia Sen ate passes bill
to ban smoking in public
buildings, but decision

will rest with the House

 

smoking ban

By Wes O’Dell
STAFF WRITER

Wafﬂe House may soon lose
one of its deﬁning characteristics:
the smoke. As will the Palms,
Malones and virtually every other
“enclosed space frequented by the
public” if a bill making its way
through the Virginia General As-
sembly musters the votes it needs
to become law.

On Feb. 5, the Virginia State
Senate approved SB l16l—The
Smoke Free Air Act. Sponsored
by J. Brandon Bell 11 (R), the act
aims to forbid smoking in any
building used by the public.

According to the General
Assembly's Legislative Infor-
mation System, the bill would
exempt privately owned homes,
residences and automobiles as
well as certain hotel rooms and
tobacco-related business. The bill
will now go to the House for con-
sideration.

Sen. Bell represents the 22nd
Senate District, which is south of
Lexington and includes all of B0-
tetourt County, all of the Cities of
Radford and Salem and parts of
Montgomery and Roanoke Coun-
ties.

According to his website, the
senator believes “all workers
have the right to breathe clean
air. Secondhand smoke is not just
an annoyance. It is dangerous...
While I respect the right of pri-

vate business to make their own
choices, the public health con-
cerns are substantial and must be
addressed.” _

Bell is no stranger to public
health issues; according to vapap.
org, a website tracking money in
Virginia politics, the healthcare
industry has contributed more
money than any other industry to
the “Bell for Senate” campaign in
the current cycle.

If passed, this bill could have a
signiﬁcant effect on commerce at
the local level, as it would effec-
tively outlaw smoking sections in
restaurants and bars.

Cindy Campbell, President
and General Manager of The
Palms restaurant, would actually
welcome the change. “I’d love for
it to pass,” she said.

She pointed out that the major-
ity of The Palms is non-smoking
already (70 percent non-smok-
ing), and that the restaurant often
has a full non-smoking section
and an empty smoking section.

Campbell attributes this in
large part to a decrease in the
number of students that smoke,
particularly law students.

She also believes the bills
passage would allow her to en-
sure a healthy atmosphere for her
staff, customers and herself while
providing a “level playing ﬁeld”
so The Palms would not be at a
competitive disadvantage by go-
ing smoke-free.

Virginia considers joining other states with smoking bans :

smoking laws across the nation:

smoking

Statelaws banning

_ Loca|_|aws banning

r, .

The ban would likely change
little at W&L; university tobacco
policies already forbid smoking
indoors.  for fraternity houses,
University General Counsel Le-
anne Shank indicated the “private
residences" exemption seems to
exclude them.

Of course, the bill must still
overcome a long history of oppo-

sition in the House from commer-
cial interests such as the Virginia
Hospitality and Travel Associa-
tion and the Virginia tobacco in-
ClllSl1'_V. A similar bill in the pre-
vious session died in a House
subconnnittee after achieving
Senate approval. The bill received
two additional votes this year.
The Lexington-Rockbridge

Chamber of Connnerce declined
to take a position on the issue and
indicated that the State Chamber
has not taken a stance either.

Virginia Governor Timothy
Kaine (D) has expressed opposi-
tion to the bill, citing its provi-
sions as overly broad.

He instead supports a narrow-
er ban for restaurants and other

offenses.

proposed smoking ban:

- Would forbid smoking in buildings or
enclosed areas used by the public.

- Exceptions would be made for private
homes. residences. automobiles and .
home—based businesses.

- Specialty tobacco stores and tobacco
manufacturers would also be exempt.

- Smoking in a prohibited area is
punishable by a $100 fine for a first

offense and a $250 fine for subsequent

public facilities. Kaine himself
recently signed an order prohibit-
ing smoking in all state govem-
ment offices, common areas and
vehicles occupied by the execu-
tive branch.

The bill is currently awaiting
hearings in a House subcommit-
tee dealing with alcohol and gain-
bling.

Mock Trial preps for nationals

Two squadsﬁrom W&L is three—year—old team will compete in March at nationals in Minneapolis

By Sacha Raab
STAFF WRITER

hile most of the Wash-
ington and Lee com-
munity is preparing

for midtenns and trying to make
it through the long and dreary
winter term, the Mock Trial team
is intensifying its practices in
preparation for Nationals, its larg-
est competition thus far.

The weekend of March 17,
while fraternities and sororities
are organizing St. Patrick’s Day
parties, two of W&L’s Mock Trial
teams will be heading to Minne-
apolis, Minn. to compete against
some of the best teams in the na-
tion. Team A, captained by David
Mitchell, is comprised of Eugina
Huang, Thadeous Larkin, Pearse
Davidson, Sarah Atkinson, Erin

Coltrera and Bill Larson.

Walker Humphrey is captain
of Team B, which includes Chris-
tine Giordano, Emily Lurie, Andy
Budzinski, Dane Davis, Emily
DeVoe, Alex Caritis and Kelly
Bundy.

At the start of fall term, the
teams laid the groundwork for
the case of the year and practiced
about two times per week. Each
practice lasts approximately two
hours and takes place at the Law
School.

Aﬁer going over the case, theo-
ries and themes, the team decided
on witnesses and began practic-
ing cross-examinations and direct
questioning. Finally, the teams
rehearsed the actual case.

The teams now focus on one
or two aspects of the trial, choos-
ing from openings, closings, di-

“7 he greatest diﬂerence between National and

Regional competition is that there are no bad

teams there. The deadwood s been cutaway. ”

DAVID GREENE, Mock Trial Assistant Coach

rect questioning or cross-exami-
nations. By this point in the year,
they are primarily ﬁne-tuningtheir
work and increasing the depth of
their cross-examinations.

With Nationals looming
ahead, their practices are becom-
ing more intense and focused.

‘The coach and assistant coaches

work with the team on improving
their adaptability to a more so-
phisticated case, which they will
likely see during the competition

in Minneapolis.

David Greene, an assistant
coach who graduated from the
University of Tennessee and is
in his third year at the W&L law
school, said, “The greatest differ-
ence between National and Re-
gional competition is that there
are no bad teams there. The dead-
wood’s been cutaway.”

Sophomore Allie Zeger, who
attended Nationals last year, talk-
ed about competing.

“My favorite part of competi-
tion is seeing how well the team
works together,” Zeger said.
“Everybody is very excited and
works very hard. People really
step up their performances and
come through for the team.”

The greatest challenge the
teams will face at Nationals con-
cerns case changes. One or two
witnesses will be added to the
case, which will result in more
facts. These could either slightly
or greatly affect the case.

There are two levels within
Nationals. The top two or three
teams in regional competition go
straight to Gold Nationals, which
takes place in St. Petersburg,
Florida in early April.

The top six or so teams go to
Silver Nationals. Silver Nation-

als takes placein Minneapolis

and in Chicago in March. The
highest placing teams in Silver
Nationals will then go on to Gold
Nationals.

Mitchell and Greene discussed
their goals for the competition
in Minneapolis. They plan on
attempting to qualify for Gold
Nationals. While qualifying for
Silver Nationals is impressive,
making it to St. Peteisburg would
greatly raise the team ’s stature.

Greene said about the teams:
“I’m pretty proud of them. I’m
optimistic for the upcoming com-
petition, because we have a lot
of people on the teams who have
been doing this for the past three
years. I’m even more optimistic
for the future, because the team
is heavily populated by freshmen
and sophomores, and we have
some very bright people.”

China .

Washington Post reporter John Pomfret will discuss China and his time there as a reporter

By Dane Davls
STAFF WRITER

he Washington and Lee
I community will host dis-
tinguished author and
Washington Post reporter John
Pomfret on Feb. 27. His sched-
uled talk is titled “Chinese Les-
sons” and will detail his seven
years as a reporter working in
China.

Pomfret will explore and dis-
cuss themes presented in his re-
cently published book “Chinese
Lessons: An American, Five
Classmates and the Story of the
New China.”

The book is an account of his
lengthy stay in China and the inti-
mate relationships he formed with
individuals from almost every
section of Chinese society.

“Chinese Lessons” has earned
widespread acclaim from the Wall
Street Journal, New York Times
and other major reviewers.

Pomfret has long-standing ex-
perience with journalism and Chi-

 ‘:7-~

 

‘‘[Modern China] is all money orientea’.

People can get houses; they can virtually

1

get anything here. ’

HONGCHU FU, Associate Professor of East Asian Languages and

Literature

na. Aside from being Los Angeles
Bureau Chief for The Washington
Post, Pomfret has over ﬁfteen
years of journalistic experience.
He has covered the 1989 Tianan-
men Square protests and conﬂicts
in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Congo,
Sri Lanka, Iraq, southwestern
Turkey and northeastern Iran.

The talk will relate his expe-
riences in China to the country’s
changing role in the world of eco-
nomics and politics.

Hongchu Fu, Associate Pro-
fessor of East Asian Languages
and Literature, said that China
today has overwhelmingly em-
braced capitalism and Western
culture.

Fu goes said that modern Chi-
na “is all money oriented. People
can get houses; they can virtually
get anything here.”

This is a radical change from
the widespread poverty that en-
trenched China for most of the
twentieth century. During the
1900s China fought a long and
bloody war with Japan before and
during World War II.

The country then fought a civ-
il war that led to the communist
takeover in 1949.

The government has allowed 0

more freedom in recent years, but
the press is still tightly regulated.

Fu said, “Everywhere you go,
you can see traditional Chinese

architecture being replaced by
Western buildings.”

This radical transformation of
China from a developing country
to an emerging world power has
created conﬂicts between Chinese

culture and Western culture. Fu'

cites the example of the Forbid-
den City, preserved and oﬁ‘-limits
to the general public for hundreds
of years. Now the palace complex
is open to tourists and is the home
of a Starbucks.

It is within this context Pomfret
wrote “Chinese Lessons.” The
story begins with his years as a

student at Nanjing University in ‘

the early 1980s. While at Nanjing
University, he met and befriend-

ed people that later became Red

Guards, villagers, businessmen,
and dissidents.

Characters in Pomfret’s book
include “Idiot Zhou, the widow
Little Guan, the sad sack Old Wu,
the feckless dissident Daybreak
Song, and Party apparatchik Big
Bluffer Ye.”

Mr. Pomfret will also visit
classes during his stay.

, Looking for a new view

A local resident encourages the university to restore downtown Lexington is view of the Colonnade

@

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

s Washington and Lee
prepares its new Master
Plan, at least one local

resident wants the plan to improve
views of the historic Colonnade.

William de Laat moved to
Lexington six months ago after
he retired from a job at the Ca-
nadian Embassy in Washington,
D.C. He ﬁrst learned about the
master plan during a presentation
by Joe Grasso, W&L’s Vice Presi-
dent for Administration and one
of the principal designers of the
proposed plans.

“As an outsider I probably
see things differently than some-
one who has lived here for a long
time,” de Laat said.

Some people feel the

wall is a nice border

to the campus; other

people think it means
‘keep out. ”

JOE GRASSO, Vlce-President
of Administration
 

De Laat’s main concern with
the plan was an initial proposal
to build new buildings at the cor-
ner of Washington and Jefferson
streets.

Grasso said W&L has backed
away from any plan to build on
that comer, but de Laat still hopes
the university will ﬁnd a way to
partially clear the views from that
comer and make the Colonnade
visible from downtown Lexing-
ton. '

Grasso said the current ver-
sion of the master plan calls for
the corral parking lot to remain in
place.

“As a newcomer — a prospec-
tive student, parents or tourists
— you come into town and there

is really no formal entrance to the
campus,” de Laat said.

“While the Lee Chapel Me-
morial entrance is attractive, it
doesn’t draw one’s eyes to the
Colonnade and great lawn,” de
Laat said in an open letter to Gras-
so and President Ken Ruscio.

In his letter, de Laat outlined
several several other suggestions
that he said would make the cam-
pus more accessible to visitors as
well as create a dramatic view of
the Colonnade. His ﬁrst proposal
is to remove the red brick wall
currently running along Jefferson
and Washington streets.

De Laat also suggested that
the school remove the Red House,
which currently houses most of
the East Asian Studies depart-
ment, as well as some of the trees
and parking lots around the cor-
ner in question.

He suggested replacing the
lost parking with an underground
garage at the comer of Washing-
ton and Jefferson.

That garage, he said in his let-
ter, could then have an open park
or plaza built on top that would
help create a sweeping view of
the Colonnade from downtown
Lexington.

“The general idea is that this
be open and accessible to the city
instead of walled off, because it
is walled off now,” de Laat said.
“To preserve not just those build-

-ings but the view of them would

be great.”

Grasso said the Board of Trust-
ees just approved the proposed lo-
cation for a new Center for Jewish
Life. That building will be built
on Washington Street right next
to R.E. Lee Episcopal Church.
Fundraising will begin soon for
that project.

While Grasso said the board
has approved some parts of the
plan, the entire proposal will not
be approved until the May board
meeting. He did say that the
school was continuing to study
proposals along Jefferson Street
and for the corner in question.

“We don’t know what we
should do with the [brick] wall,”

 

JACOB GEIGER / Manging Editor

Though downtown Lexington used to have a’ sweeping vlew of the Colonnade, that vlew Is now largely blocked by
trees In the corral parking lot. The brlck wall at the corner of Washington and Jefferson was bullt In the 19905.

Grasso said. “Some people feel
the wall is a nice border to the
campus; other people think it
means ‘keep out.”’

Grasso said he believes the
brick wall was built during the
early 1990s, when John Wilson
was president of W&L.

In a letter that will run in
the Rockbridge Weekly, Grasso
agreed with de Laat’s suggestion
that the school work with Lexing-
ton to improve the views along
Jefferson Street. Grasso’s letter
said that placing utilities under-
ground and improving surround-
ing sidewalks would “be long

term investments in the attractive-
ness of downtown Lexington.”

De Laat said that while much
of the master plan is still under
consideration, he wanted the
school to at least consider the
concept of a formal entrance to
the school.

“People, when they think about
the school’s mission, rightly thing
of the academic requirements
of the university,” de Laat said.
“But when you’re in a small city
and custodians of a National His-
toric Site, it’s incumbent on you
to consider other factors » and I
know that the school does.”

Venezuela article
lacks some context

Arguments against Venezuela is leader poor: unbalanced ,

comments and concerns
about Abel Delgado’s article
“The Demise of Democracy.”
First let me begin by saying
that, in general, I felt that the
article was in some ways vague,
at one point unfair/incorrect and
overall tended to misrepresent
and misunderstand a large portion
of many of Venezuela’s issues.
A few points:

I just thought I’d offer a few

1. In reference to the line,
“giving the dictator, I mean presi-
dent”, Chavez is the democrati-
cally elected leader of his coun-
try.

He was elected in what were
deemed to be fair elections, which
represented the majority will of
the people.

Yes, his actions have made the
form of government more author-
itarian, but he is not a dictator.

2. The classiﬁcation of Ven-
ezuela as “the birthplace of the
new and improved militant left”
is incorrect, mostly because
Chavez’s government is not a
military regime.

The military does have a role
in carrying out social programs
but the government itself is inde-
pendent of the military and in no
way involves itself in governmen-
tal or political affairs.

2.5 A few small points on the
paragraph about nationalizing the
entire energy sector.

How does this paragraph at all
present evidence that the policy it-
self is not meant to help the poor.

Bringing industries under state

control is usually done as some
part of a larger redistribution of
wealth across the country, largely
intended to help the poor.

Despite this point, yes,
Chavez’s policies have done little
to help the poor, but the overall
argument made as to why is poor.

3. With respect to the follow-
ing; “He has continually meddled
in other Latin American elec-
tions.”

This is referring to exactly
what election, when, where?

Is it referring to Chavez been
a vocal supporting of other leﬁist
leaders or candidates in the re-
gion, much the same way a Presi-
dent here might throw his weight
behind his preferred candidate?

Or is it possible referring to
the Nicaraguan election where
former leftist Sandinista leader
Daniel Ortega was fairly and
freely elected by the‘ people of his
country, and whom Chavez con-
gratulated on the victory.

4. I would like to see where
the author got his information on
Chavez calling for “a uniﬁed Lat-
in American military similar to
NATO, only under his control.”

What I do know is that [the fol-
lowing is taken from the website
www.cfr.org/publication/11285/
hugo_chavezs_world_tour.htrnl]
Chavez has called for the spread
of what he calls a “Bolivarian
Revolution.”

This would be the uniting of
Latin America under a uniﬁed
system similar to that of the Eu-
ropean Union.

That union however, is found-

ed more so on the basic of eco-
nomic power and not on military
alliances or groups.

In order to conclude I would
like to add another point or two.

The proportion to which the
Venezuelan “threat” is expounded
and presented in this article is
ﬂawed and unbalanced.

And ﬁnally, if you are going to
examine Chavez’s inﬂuence in or
threat to region, you have to look
at his actions and policies within a
broader Latin American context.

The leftist movements are split
into two.

To quote Jorge G. Castaneda
“One is modern, open-minded, re-
formist, and intemationalist, and
it springs, paradoxically, from the
hard-core left of the past.

The other, born of the great
tradition of Latin American popu-
lism, is nationalist, strident, and
close-minded.”

(www.foreignaffairs.org/
2006050lfaessay85302/jorge-g-
castaneda/latin-america-s—leﬁ-«
tum.htrnl).

It is to this second group that
Chavez belongs, but understand-
ing the affects inside and outside
of Venezuela would be hard with-
out a deeper understanding of
the roots of his and other leftist
movements in Latin America.

I appreciate you listening to
my comments and concerns and
please feel free to contact me if
you wish.

It has been another busy
week for the W&L rumor
mill.

As the Inter-Fratemity

' Council launches another in-
vestigation of pledgeship — or
New Member Education, as
the school would like it to be
called — rumors are ﬂying.

In the span of one or two
hours, fratemities have been
convicted then exonerated,
kicked off campus and then
rehabilitated.

The IFC and school ad-
ministration probably can’t
work that fast, but the rumor
mill can. Which fraternities
were under investigation?
All of them? Just a few? .

The rumor mill keeps try-
ing to answer these questions,
but a different answer comes
around every hour.

Everyone claims to have

heard — directly from a reli-
able friend on the IFC, of
course — exactly who will be
punished and who is in the
clear.

Butinstead of keeping stu-
dents informed of the devel-
oping events, the IF C sent out
yet another broadcast e-mail
that essentially says nothing
other than “everyone be good

and behave yourselves.”

feditorial

IFC must silence
rumors with facts

Public disclosure can put a stop to wild rumors

W&L’s hazing policies
seem relatively straightfor-
ward, but their enforcement
is anything but clear. Who
does handle enforcement and
disciplinary issues? The IFC
or the Student Affairs Com-
mittee?

During our last issue we
used this same space to dis-
cuss how the school could
build and maintain strong
relationships with the student
media. We said that the ad-
ministration usually does a
good job of maintaining open
lines of communication.

And while what we said is
still true, it is disappointing
that the school has not chosen
to be more open about the on-
going investigations.

The recent IFC investiga-
tions are far more important
that school-press relations.
These recent meetings could
decide the fate of entire fra-
ternities and the people — both
brothers and pledges — who
belong to them.

They could decide if
sophomores will stay in their
houses or be forced to move
out. They will determine
if freshmen have been go-
ing through a legitimate new
member education or inap-

propriate hazing.

When the stakes are this
high, should the rumor mill
be allowed to rule?

The IFC is wielding con-
siderable power right now,
and with that power comes a
responsibility to provide in-
formation about the ongoing
cases. The council does not
need to release its preliminary
investigations, but it should
move quickly to release its
ultimate ﬁndings.

In a perfect world the IFC
would have more time to con-
duct its investigations before
taking action, but W&L is not
always a perfect world. Since
rumors are going to keep
swirling, the IFC must pro-
vide some facts to the entire
community.

If sanctions are going to
be handed out, they should
be publicly announced, not
simply delivered to the presi-
dent of a house. If a house is
investigated and found inno-

vaccine pushessex

Texas governor has mandated the HPVvaccine for female sixth—graders

By Cody Beauchamp
coLu M NIST

On Feb. 3, Texas Governor
Rick Perry issued an executive or-
der that will require Texas school-
girls to get vaccinated against the
human papillomavirus (HPV), a
sexually-transmitted virus that
has been shown to cause cervical
cancer.

Perry, Bush’s hand-picked suc-
cessor as governor of Texas—and
one of the staunchest of conser-
vatives—sidestepped the Repub-
lican-controlled legislature with
the use of the executive order.

In doing so, he sidestepped
conservative religious and par-
enting groups that would have
certainly protested had the issue
been given a chance to be debated
on the ﬂoor of the statehouse.

In other words, Perry decided
to ignore powerful religious con-
servatives and implement a law
that will greatly reduce a deadly
STI’s prevalence in the second
most populated state in America.

Attaboy, Rick!

Let me say this—-norrnally I’m
not much of a Perry fan. As much
as I abhor the man as president,
I’ll admit that Perry’s predecessor
(a little-known “decider” named
George Bush) really was a good
governor. No, really.

Perry, on the other hand, is an-
other story.

On his watch, multiple special
sessions of the Texas legislature
have failed to reach any good
solution to a critically important
school ﬁnance debate (namely,
for all you non-Texans, “how the

According to critics, immunizing
Texas girls against ST Is will some-
how increase promiscuity.

heck are we going to pay for our
schools?”).

He has used his veto power a
record number of times for a Texas
governor. He has been criticized
nonstop in the state for being very
partisan. He is not, normally, the
kind of guy who disagrees with
Texas’ (many, many, many) reli-
gious conservatives.

Yet, in a bold move, Perry or-
dered the HPV vaccinations.

What’s bold is he did it by
way of executive order, meaning
that the powerful religious con-
servative groups that would have
torpedoed any bill mandating
vaccinations had it gone through
the legislature had no say in the
process.

Thanks, Rick.

The arguments of the religious
conservatives against the vac-
cinations are pretty lackluster to
begin with. Supposedly, accord-
ing to critics, immunizing Texas
girls against STIs will somehow
increase promiscuity and the like-

lihood they will have sex.

However, the vaccinations as
Perry ordered them will be given
predominantly to ll- and 12-year-
old girls. I highly doubt that most
11- or 12-year old girls are think-
ing seriously about sex.

0

If they are (I can’t really as-
certain that information without
asking some Christopher Walken-
level creepy questions), I can
promise you very, very, few boys
their age are. So, while the vac-
cines may put the thought into
their heads, most won’t be able
act on it until another few years,
by which time sex is on the mind
anyway.

Another argument critics of
the HPV vaccination have is that
ordering the vaccine eliminates
parents from the picture, takes
away a choice they have in how
to raise their children.

Fine, I’ll concede that manda-
tory vaccination does that. But,
why then is no one crying foul
over mandatory polio shots? How
about whooping cough vaccines?
Measles? Mumps?

There’s a battery of vaccina-
tions that most parents are willing
to allow their children to receive
because they know that getting
the vaccinations will protect their
children against horrible diseas-
es.

When they were mandated, the
vaccines fought what were very
real threats to public health, and
the vaccination campaigns have
put real dents in the prevalence of

all the illnesses.

Why, then, are we so scared
to ﬁght an STI in the same way
we’ve fought any of the above
diseases?

The answer can be broken
down into three letters — “s,” “e,”
and “x.” Texas religious conser-
vatives don’t like talking openly
about sex.

They don’t want their children
to know anything about it, other
than that it’s one of the most hor-
rible decisions you can make, un-

less you’re making it with a ring ’

on your ﬁnger and to the love oi
your life.

As a Methodist by birth, a
Baptist by faith, and the native 01
a pretty zealously religious town,
I understand that argument.

I don’t entirely agree, but 1 un-
derstand.

But for the good of society,
I’m glad that Perry-—another re-
ligiously-raised, small—town Tex-
an—decided to grow up and face
the music.

Much to the dismay of faith-
ful Christians, people have sex
out of wedlock; girls having sex
can contract a life-threatening vi-
rus; there is a vaccine available
that could prevent almost all girls
from contracting HPV.

Perry, as governor of Texas,
went against his staunchest politi-
cal supporters and even his own
extremely conservative personal
faith.

He did the practical and prag-
matic thing, and likely will save
many Texas girls from HPV.

Maybe he’s not so bad after ‘

all.

“Oscar and Felix” presented a
delightful version ofNeil Simon’s
“The Odd Couple” last weekend
in the Lenfest Center. The play
successfully captured the hilarity
of two opposites forced to live
under the same roof, keeping the
audience laughing until the last
applause.

The cast portrayed the time-
less characters of Simon’s comic
genius well. Noticeable among
the performances was senior
Lauren Kampf’s Ynez, the Sexy
Spaniard who ﬂirts with Oscar
and Felix. Everything in Kampf’s
delivery was top notch, from her
Spanish accent to her over-the-

top boisterous behavior.

The highlight of the evening
undoubtedly was junior Wil-
liam Holliday’s portrayal of neat
freak Felix Unger set against ju-
nior Charles Barbour’s depiction
of slob Oscar Madison.

Holliday superbly embodied
the prim and prissy Felix, never
breaking form and delivering his
lines with a humor and believ-
ability that would have done Si-
mon proud. Barbour played the
gruff, good-for-nothing Oscar
with a charisma and comedy that
really made his character come
to life.

According to Barbour, the
best thing about being part of a
cast of such timeless characters
is Neil Simon’s hilarity.The
play also excelled in highlight-
ing the subtle themes of Simon’s

  

THE RING-TUM PHI '

  Performers dazzle audiences
in Lenfest Center with comical
presentation of Simon classic

work. The “new look” at the Odd
Couple drew attention to issues
of sexuality and society’s no-
tions about them. This added to
the comedy while also question-
ing the themes of Simon’s play.

The actors did a good job of
layering their roles, adding a
meaningﬁil tone to the humor of
Oscar and Felix’s dysfunctional
relationship. Attention to these
details of the comedy made the
show truly satisfying.

Such a fantastic production
of a classic speaks to the quality
of Washington and Lee’s theater
program, a program which often
gets overlooked in the myriad
of other disciplines offered at
W&L.

“The W&L theater department
has grown tremendously. More
and more people are getting in-
volved, and the faculty treats you
like family,” Barbour said.

“It’s an unusual experience
because the department sees
every side of you - not just the
good tidy student go-to-class
smile and drink coffee side - but
also the messed up hair, pissed
off and I’m about to go mental
side. But they still put up with

you. It’s a beautiful thing,” Bar-
bour continued

The beauty of the students’
commitment to theater and their
talents was indeed evidenced
in their outstanding production
of the play. Overall, the show
was received well by the crowd
and was a pleasure to watch the
whole way through. What a way
to spend a Friday evening.

  Clubs venture nationwide

Several students will spend Feb. break serving impoverished or exploring exotic wildlife

By Queenie Wong
STAFF WRITER

For one week, members of
the Nabors Service League, Bon-
ner Leaders Program and Outing
Club will venture into different
worlds. Away from the familiar
Lacoste polo shirts and blue blaz-
ers of this campus, each club will
kick off its Washington Break
by tackling issues ranging from
homelessness to surviving in the
Wilderness. The NSL will travel
to Houston, Texas; the Bonner
Leaders Program to Immokalee,
Florida; and the Outing Club to
Everglades, Florida.

The NSL started organizing its
trip alter a Washington and Lee
alumnus working for Teach for
America in New Orleans moved
to Houston, said Micaela Coffey,
NSL’s Alternative Breaks Chair.
Following ‘Hurricane Katrina,
the alum asked for help on the
Knowledge is Power Program
(KIPP) school that was granted
an emergency charter after the
hurricane.

NSL, which is sending 15 stu-
dents on the trip, will work with
SEARCH, a nonproﬁt organiza-
tion helping 14,000 of Houston’s
homeless, Coffey said. The Hous-
ton Alumni Association is spon-
soring the trip.

“It’s so comforting, as a stu-
dent, to see how generous the
W&L alums are,” Colfey said.
“That they care so much about
current students means a lot to me
and is yet another reason that I’m
proud to be a W&L student.”

NSL is holding a fundraiser
this Thursday at Frank’s from 5-
10 p.m. 20 percent of the restau-
rant’s proﬁts will go towards the
$100 fee for the Houston trip, said
Sonia Siu, NSL’s General Chair.

While the NSL helps the home-
less, 11 ﬁrst-year Bonner leaders
will be tackling a different issue:
rural poverty. Immokalee, Florida
is an agricultural district which
functions as a hub for low wage
workers, said Bonner Leader Pro-
gram Director Sandra Hayslette.-

“This trip humanizes the is-
sue of poverty and low wages by
coming face to face with these
problems,” she said.

According to Hayslette, the
trip contains both a community
service and educational aspect.
The leaders will perform services
ranging from helping Harvest for
Humanity create affordable hous-
ing to talking to the Rural Legal
Service and the Coalition of Im-
mokalee Workers. Hayslette es-
timates that Bonner leaders will
accomplish at least eight hours of
community service each day. She

also hopes, following the trip, that
leaders will be able to analyze and
compare their lives to the lives of
Immokalee residents.

“I think one thing students will
get from this trip is a lot of food
for thought—no pun intended,”
she said.

Because the trip is fully spon-
sored by the Bonner Foundation,
participants will be staying at the
Immokalee Friendship House, a
homeless shelter, where they will
share meals and converse with
residents.

This is the ﬁrst time the Bon-
ner Leaders Program created a
trip for ﬁrst-year members.

In another part of Florida, the
Everglades, 13 Outing Club mem-
bers will ﬁnd themselves kayak-
ing through mangrove islands and
camping on beaches, Outing Club
Director James Dick said. This is
the 13th year the Outing Club has
participated in this trip.

“I ﬁgured it’s a chance to learn
something new and get away from
all the cliche trips and vacations,”
said sophomore Allison Gionta,
who is attending the trip.

According to Dick, the partici-
pants will cook their own meals
and carry their own kayak gear.
They will also have a former park
ranger and a commercial ﬁsher-
man guiding them throughout the

aginas are for lovers. Or

so the t-shirts say. The

Vagina Monologues
are back. This is the third per-
formance of the monologues at
Washington and Lee, sponsored
by the Women’s Law Students
Organization.

Previously, the organization
sponsored the show every other
year, but the leadership decided
to try an annual performance af-
ter the success of the last year’s
show.

The Vagina Monologues are
performed on college campuses
every year around Valentine’s
Day to raise awareness about
women’s issues, from sexual
misconduct and violence against
women worldwide, to everyday
things like going to the gynecolo-
gist.

“It’s a really good way to get
things on the table,” said Crystal
Teed, a ﬁrst-year law student and ;
one of over twenty women from
the law school, undergraduate

“T he heart of the production is real wom-

en Ls voices being heard I get to bring out

the superstar in me. It is for any woman who

has ever felt uncomfortable. ’

YVONNE COKER, Junlor partlclpant
 

school, and the faculty at W&L

performing this year. “It breaks

down barriers in a really con-
structive way.”

Teed did not know much about
the monologues before she saw
an advertisement for auditions
in the law school. Coming from

y a performing arts family, she

wanted a creative outlet to offset
her schoolwork. After the ﬁrst
read through of the script with the
other actors, she was hooked.
“It’s a very introspective pro-
cess,” she said. “The play really
tries to tap into every woman.”
Each monologue focuses on a
dilferent aspect of being a wom-

an, often exploring transitive pe-
riods in life and sensitive aspects
of relationships.

The value of the monologues
also creates the controversy sur-
rounding them, because they are
written in a way that is very up
front and edgy.

E’Lon Cohen, an undergradu-
ate senior, knew exactly what she
was getting into.

She has seen the monologues

on stage twice and decided to au- .

dition thﬁ year after she was con-
vinced to by a friend.
“It gives me a way to show
me,” she said about her piece.
She said that women tend to

freeze up when asked about con-
troversial issues, and this was a
chance for her to step out of her
comfort zone and be able to show
an aspect of herself that most peo-
ple might not see.

Yvonne Coker, an undergradu-
ate junior, also decided to audition
after seeing the show last year.

She was attracted by the idea
that the actresses did not need to
have prior experience i11 order to
get involved.

“The heart of the production
is real women’s voices being
heard,” she said.

“I get to bring out the superstar
in me. It’s for any woman who
has ever felt uncomfortable.”

Each year a new monologue is
written to spotlight a different is-
sue around the world.

Last year, the monologue was
about the plight of the Vietnam-
ese “comfort women” exploited
as prostitutes by the Japanese
military during World War II.

This year, due to the increase
in violence against women and
girls that occurs in time of war,
the spotlight issue is women in

conﬂict zones.

The campaign is motivated by
recent conﬂicts in Sudan, Congo,
and Iraq. It is aimed at making
sure the issue of sexual violence
remains in the media even though
the conﬂicts at hand might seem
commonplace because of their

‘ frequency.

For the women involved in the
production at W&L, it is about
carrying that message but also
about raising awareness here.

“Lexington is a small town,”
Teed said.

“We don’t always talk about
certain things. Hopefully, this
will give people an opportunity
to feel connected and everyone
will come away with something
different."

“It‘s fun and difficult,” said
Coker about her acting experience
so far. “But the fact that I want to
be excellent motivates me.”

The Vagina Monologues will
be performed this Thursday and
Friday in the Troubadour The-
ater.

Tickets will be available in ad-
vance or at the door.

Wrestling

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team has been unstoppable in re-
cent weeks, posting a 3-0 record
and defeating the top two teams
in the Centennial Conference.
Saturday morning, the Generals
defeated Newport News Ap-
prentice School, 21-15. With the
victory, the Generals improve to
8-3, which is the most wins that the
team has posted in a season since
the 1986-1987 campaign, when it
went 9-5. Juniors David Shubick
and Jesse Sataloff and freshman
Sammy Brusca all registered wins
in the meet. Two weekends ago,
W&L posted a pair of huge up-
sets over the top two teams in the
Centennial Conference. The Gen-
erals captured a 21-17 decision
over previously-undefeated 30th
ranked Ursinus and then claimed
a 18-16 triumph over Muhlen-
berg. With the win, the Generals
also snapped Ursinus’ 27-match
unbeaten streak in conference
action. Both of the victories were
not decided until the heavyweight
bout. Against Muhlenberg, the
Generals were trailing by a point
when sophomore John Christopher
defeated his opponent 3-2 to clinch
the victory for the Generals. In the
Ursinus match, the teams were
tied going into the ﬁnal match, but
Christopher defeated his opponent

l“"m‘:"",6’-_5 to give W&L a victory. Peter
 Iéawrerice, Sataloﬂ‘ and Anthony

Boniello were also undefeated on
the day. The Generals return to

ence Championships hosted by
Gettysburg College at 11 a.m.

The Washington and Lee men’s
and women’s indoor track and
ﬁeld teams had eight ﬁrst—place
finishes, set six school records
and had two athletes qualify for
nationals against Division I,II and
III opponents this past weekend
at the Bucknell Winter Classic.
The W&L women broke a school
record three times over in the same
event when sophomore Jackie
Burns ﬁnished third overall and
ﬁrst among D-III runners in the
mile. Burns shaved over seven
seconds off the previous school
record. In that same race, sopho-
mores Becca Taylor and Elizabeth
Webb also broke the same school
record, ﬁnishing fourth and ﬁfth
overall, respectively. Webb also
crossed the ﬁnish line ﬁrst overall
in the 800—meters. Freshman Mag-
gie Sutherland broke two school
records single-handedly and ﬁn-
ished ﬁrst overall in the high jump.
She broke her own school record
with a leap of 5’5.0.” Sutherland’s
height was also an NCAA Provi-
sional Qualifying Standard. She
also broke her own school record
in the 55-meter hurdles and ﬁn-
ished third among D—III runners.
Sophomore Stacy Doombos ﬁn-
ished ﬁrst overall in the long jump,
also breaking her own school
record. With a jump of l7’9.75”,
Doombos’ performance was‘ also
an NCAA Provisional Qualifying
Standard. Additionally, Doombos
set a new school record in the
200-meters, ﬁnishing ﬁrst among
D-III athletes. The Generals return
to action on Saturday when they
participate in the Virginia Tech

Hunsinger sets record

Jessica Hunsinger sets a school
record for rebounds, but record
winning streak ends for Generals

By Madeline Gent
STAFF WRITER

On Tuesday, Feb. 6, Washing-
ton and Lee women’s basketball
achieved a feat it has never before
reached.

In the Warner Center, senior
Jessica Hunsinger became the
ﬁrst ever General to have pulled
down a thousand rebounds. Even
though the team lost to visiting
Guilford in a 72-66 overtime
decision, Hunsinger, the team’s
captain, had good reason to be
proud of her athletic performance
at W&L.

In fact, all of W&L has good
reason to be proud of Hunsinger,
as well as the entire women’s
team.

With a recent school-record
winning streak, or seven games
and an overall 12-10 record (8-
9 in ODAC play), this season
has proved to be one of the most
promising in recent memory for
the blue and white.

“The record is a nice thing to
brag about in front of the men’s
team,” said Hunsinger, “but I am
more excited about how well we
have been playing.”

Team effort aside, Hunsinger
has made herself a force to be
dealt with on the basketball court.
The three year letter-winner start-
ed oﬁ‘ her season ranked second
in school history with 168 career
blocks, third all-time with 779 re-
bounds and sixth in scoring with
1,118 points.

In the past 22 games, all of
which Hunsinger has started, she
has scored 276 points, making her
second in scoring to fellow team-
mate junior Kristen Krouchick,
leads the team in rebounding with
229 boards and has 76 blocks un-
der her belt — breaking her own
school record of 74.

Going into Tuesday night’s
game, Hunsinger said, “I wasn’t
anxious about [the thousand re-
bounds] mostly because people
told me I could do it. I don’t

really keep track of how many
rebounds I had or have. I didn’t
realize until I actually had it, but I
felt conﬁdent that this would hap-
pen eventually.”

The ofﬁcials stopped the clock
when Hunsinger hit her mark for
a brief moment of celebration.

“I was aware that Jess was
getting pretty close to the record,
although when they announced it
during the game, it was somewhat
of a surprise,” said junior team-
mate Emily Wolff.

“During the game, when she
pulled the thousandth rebound,
we stopped playing, and it was
announced that she had broken
the record. We all gave her hugs
and congratulations, but then con-
tinued playing.”

Hunsinger added, “They were
all very excited for me and they’ve
all been there all along the way
— four years of rebounding...so
much of it depends on what my
teammates were doing — whether
or not they were boxing out. It
was deﬁnitely a team effort.”

As for the celebration, she said
“it would have been better if we
won.”

With the season coming to an
end, Hunsinger’s achievement
proves the women still have some
ﬁght left to take to the ODAC
tournament.

“Not only is Jessica breaking
records, but the team is as well...
the record for most consecutive
wins,” said Wolﬁi

“It just shows that this year we
are determined to take it to the
next level and not settle for me-
diocrity.” -

On Tuesday, the women will
head to Hollins. Even with one
feat down, Hunsinger is just 14
rebounds away from another one
— the ODAC record for most re-
bounds in a career.

Whether you’re just going to
see history happen or just to cheer
on the women, the next few games
for W&L’s women’s basketball
team will be exciting to follow.

Pros look intolerant again

Some NBA stars look boorish and backwards as they criticize openly gay player

ByAdam Lewis
COLUMNISI

Alright, it’s time to tackle this
issue once and for all. Former
NBA center Joe Amaechi an-
nounced this week that he is gay,
surprising teammates, coaches
and fans, all of whom had little if
any suspicion regarding his sex-
ual orientation.
Following his

“coming out,”
players and
coaches from
around the
league began
making com-

 

ments, ranging
from the re-
spectful understanding of Amae-
chi’s position to the resentment
of his “secret,” which he had kept
quiet throughout his career. My
question is: Why the hell does it
matter?

1. Just because he happens
to be attracted to the male gen-
der does not mean that he is
suddenly going to hit on every

man he sees.

For some reason, this is a com-
mon occurrence in our society,
and is especially prevalent in all-
male organizations, such as the
army and the NBA. Regarding
this issue, NBA player Shavlik
Randolph (who, by the way, was
Duke—educated), made his view-
point clear: “As long as you don’t
bring your gayness on me I’m
ﬁne....I’m sure I could play with
him. But I think it would create a
little awkwardness in the locker
room.” Now tell me something,
Mr. Randolph. Do you have such
a high opinion of yourself that you
think anyone who likes men will
have the uncontrollable urge to
approach you in the locker room
with the intentions of asking you
on a date or touching you? Don’t
ﬂatter yourself; you don’t even
start on one of the worst teams
in the NBA. People need to un-
derstand that being gay does not
entail the inappropriate attraction
to all men. It’s that simple.

2. Statistics show that ho-
mosexuality (estimated to be

NBA commissioner David Stern said it best:

“We have a very diverse league. The question

at the NBA is always: ‘Have you got game? 

around 10 percent of the adult
population) is about as common
as being left-handed (estimated
to be around 8-15 percent of the
adult population).

Why then does society require
homosexuals to reveal this per-
sonal attribute to everyone, and
then shun them for having kept
it a secret? You don’t see lefties
going around declaring that they
write with their left hand, nor do
you see people gossiping about
the “lefty that came out of the
closet.” To me, this is just mind-
boggling. And I would like to
use a comment from the face of
the NBA, Lebron James, to fur-
ther my point: “With teammates
you have to be trustworthy, and if
you’re gay and you’re not admit-

ting that you are, then you are not
trustworthy.” I’m sorry, Lebron.
Did Joe Amaechi offend you by
not letting you in on his personal
life‘? Wow, I can’t imagine what
it would be like if one of your
teammates tells you he is a lefty.
Wouldn’t want to be that guy-he
would be so untrustworthy.

3. Being gay may imply many
things, but athletic ability is not
one of them.

As shown by Martina Navra-
tilova and Sheryl Swoopes, both
of whom are regarded as some of
the best players in their respective
sports, homosexuality does not
inhibit one’s athletic performance.
What really matters? As far as I
know, sports are about competi-
tion, entertainment and nowa-

days, money. If an athlete is able
to compete, entertain and make
money, why is sexual preference

even an issue? If he scores on '

the court, why does it matter who
he scores with after the game? It
doesn’t. NBA commissioner Da-
vid Stern said it best: “We have a
very diverse league. The question
at the NBA is always: ‘Have you
got game?”

As great as American sports
are, this is deﬁnitely something
that has got to change. There
have been only a handful oi
professional athletes to publicly
come out, and with the struggle
they have had to deal with, who
can blame those who haven’t? I
commend Joe Amaechi for tak-
ing the step that he did, and I can
only hope that in years to come.
the world of sports changes and
learns to acknowledge an ath-
lete’s performance, not his ori-
entation. To use the words of the
great Jerry Seinfeld: Joe Amaechi
is gay, “Not that there’s anything
wrong with that”—because there
most deﬁnitely isn’t.

THE RING-TUM PHI ° 9

Wrestling:

 Blue and White

slam opponents

Contlnued from page 12

The winning streak was not to
survive to 28 as the Generals, be-
hind the strength of sophomore
heavyweight John Christopher.

Christopher’s bouts were the
deciding factor in both match-
es. The Blue and White trailed
Muhlenberg 15-16 before the
Fort Lauderdale man took the mat
and topped the Mules.’ Joe Tartar;
likewise, W&L was tied with na-
tionally-ranked Ursinus before
Christopher’s win over Matt Wil-
liams. .

Both victories were by a single
point, and both handed the win to
the home side.

Generals wrestlers Peter Law-
rence and Anthony Boniello also
deserve a heavy dose of credit for
pins in the Ursinus match.

Lawrence, at 157 pounds, took
only two minutes and 13 seconds
to pin his opponent.

He, Boniello and Sataloﬁ were
undefeated on the day, losing nei-
ther against the Mules nor the
Bears.

_ The Generals’ threqwins bring

“their record to eightiwins and

three losses (5-2 in Centennial
Conference play).

This is W&L’s best record
since they posted nine wins and
ﬁve losses in the 1986-1987 sea-
son.

The team will try to continue
its wave of recent success at the
Centennial Conference champi-

onships next Saturday at Gettys-

Despite their loss, Ursinus is
considered the favorite to add a
ﬁﬁh consecutive title to their im-
pressive trophy case.

But also, the Generals cannot
be counted out. After their two
big wins over Ursinus and Mul-
henberg, they have momentum in
their favor as they enter into the
Centennial Conference champi-
onships.

Boniello said, “Everyone is

is looking at us wondering what
we can do. We have a lot of con-

fidence. It just feels great beating
the topitwo dogs.”

As for the team as a whole,
there are very high expectations
for everyone.

Boniello said, “Across the
board we have a lot of kids who
can perform very well. We’re
hoping for at least four kids to get

intensity and their experience.

Boniello said, “The intensity

Generals win 8 events, sets 3 school records
and have 2 qualify for NCAA championships

By Mlke Huntress
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s indoor
track team returned from the
Bucknell Winter Classic this Sat-
urday with a host of accolades.

Against competition from all
levels, W&L’s Division III team
managed to claim two national
qualiﬁers, set six school records,
and ﬁelded eight winners between
the men’s and women’s teams.

It’s an impressive feat for a
program draws from a student
body which is a fraction of some
of the programs W&L competed
against Saturday.

The event which typiﬁed
W&L’s success was the women’s
mile. In that one event, the former
school record of 5:26.23 was bro-
ken by three different women.

Elizabeth Webb would have
had the new mark at 5:25.71
(she ﬁnished eighth overall in the
event) had she not been eclipsed
by two team mates.

Sophomore Becca Taylor ﬁn-
ished fourth overall (third among
Div III athletes) with a time of
5:19.52 and sophomore Jackie
Bums ﬁnished third overall (ﬁrst
among Div. III athletes) with a
time that now stands as W&L’s
benchmark mile time at 5:18.97.

Sophomore Stacy Doombos
took home two school records
herself on Saturday. The ﬁrst was
in the 200-meter dash with a time
of 26.88 seconds, which put her
ﬁrst among D-III athletes.

She later outdid her own
school record in the long jump
with a leap of l7’9.75”, which
stands as an NCAA Provisional
Qualifying Standard.

Freshman Maggie Sutherland
was W&L’s other signiﬁcant fe-
male jumper on Saturday, ﬁnish-
ing ﬁrst overall in the high jump,

“It was a group effort. There were so many

people in our heat that we wanted to stick to-

gether as much as possible. ”

JACKIE BURNS. sophomore distance runner

with ajump of5’5.0”.

It beat what was previously
her own school record, and also
was an NCAA Provisional Quali-
fying Standard.

Sutherland also broke her own
school record in the 55-meter
hurdles with a time of 8.95 sec-
onds, good for third among D—III
runners.

The W&L men’s performance
was highlighted by the efforts of
sophomores Drew Martin and
Michael Welsh.

Martin’s pole vault of 13’9.25”
placed him ﬁrst among D—III ath-
letes and Welsh’s time of 9:04.32
in the 3000-meters also put him at
the top of the D-III time sheet.

Other W&L runners did well
on Saturday. Sophomore Alan
Jackson was second among D-
III runners in the 5,000-meters,
junior Steve Rivoir placed third
among D—III runners with a mile
time of 4:34.84.

The 4x400-meter relay team
ﬁnished second among D—III
teams. Sophomore Chip McCoy,
junior Matt Harrison, freshman
Rob Saliers, and junior Marshall
French crossed the ﬁnish time in
a time of3:34.l6.

Throwers Billy Billington and
Ben Wilson also had solid perfor-
mances.

Billington, a freshman, put
up a weight throw distance of
4l’4.25” (good for third among
Div III throwers).

Sophomore Ben Wilson put up

a distance of 4l’4.25”, good for
second among D—III shot putters.

W&L’s men and women track
teams proved their mettle at Buck-
nell against stiff competition, per-
forming admirably.

Burns, who was competing in
her face race of the season, was
modest about setting her school
record: “I’m a little out of prac-
tice so I had to get used to it pretty
fast. It was a group effort. There
were so many people in our heat
that we wanted to stick together
as much as possible.”

Burns said that herself, Telf-
eyan, Taylor and Webb all took
turns leading the pack of W&L
women.

In the end, Burns led the way
to the ﬁnish with two of her team-

mates crossing the line immedi- V

ately after her.

Burns said she felt great aﬁer
taking a break from competition:
“I needed to take a mental break
from the cross country team, and
I wanted time to build up a big
mileage base. It was a mental and
a physical break.” .

It has been a very strong in-
door season for the Generals,
and the team has a great deal of
momentum going into the ODAC
championships.

“We’re a stronger team then
we were last year,” Burns said.

The Generals are back in ac-
tion this coming Saturday when
they take to the track at the Vir-
ginia Tech Challenge.

Sophomore Jackle Burns takes the lead ahead of sophomore Becca Taylor and Eliza-
beth Webb. All three runners bested the previous school record in the one-mile, but
Burns finished in a time of 5:18.97. The former record was 5:26.23.

Swimmers prep for ODACs'

Women is swim team looks to carry on thirteen-year winning streak heading into the ODAC championships

By Mlchael Keenan"
STA FF w n are a

On Feb. 3 the women’s swim
team concluded its regular season
with ODAC victories over Hollins
and Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College to improve their over-
all record to 7-9 and 5-1 against
ODAC opponents.

The women defeated Hollins
180-61 and Randolph-Macon
Woman’s 154-86.

They have now won three of
their last four meets, with the only
loss coming to tenth ranked Johns
Hopkins.

The Generals were led by
sophomore Susan Mahoney, who
registered wins in the 200 back-
stroke and 1000 freestyle.

Junior Allison Rogers and se-
nior Abbie Sauter also contribut-
ed ﬁrst place ﬁnishes. Rogers won
the 50 free and Sauter touched
ﬁrst in the 100 free.

This season has been different
for the women, because for the
ﬁrst time in ﬁfteen years, a new
coach took over the program.

Over the summer, Kiki Ja-
cobs ended her ﬁfteen-year run
as Women’s Head Swim Coach

“Our record this year does not show how much

Joel has done for this team, but he has been

7

tremendous. ’

ABBIE SAUTER. senlor captaln

at Washington and Lee when she
accepted the Associate Athletic
Director position at Oberlin Col-
lege.

During her tenure the team
compiled a 121-79 record and has
a current streak of thirteen con-
secutive ODAC Championships.
Jacobs was named ODAC/Atlan-
tic States Coach of the Year ten
times.

Men’s Head Coach Joel Shi-
noﬁeld was named interim head
coach while a search began for a
new women’s coach.

The women’s team has re-
sponded extremely well to the
coaching change. Susan Mahoney
called Shinoﬁeld “one of the best
coaches” she’s ever had.

“We handled the coaching
change this year very well. Since
Joel was the coach for the boys’

team last year, we had some idea
of how practices would be run and
the work that would be performed
outside of the pool,” sophomore-
Julianne Miata said.

“Although Kiki was amazing
and we were sad to see her go,
Joel has really given us some-
thing to be excited for.”

“Our record this year does not
show how much Joel has done
for this team, but he has been tre-
mendous,” said Sauter. “Not only
is everyone on the team ﬁnally
swimming to their potential, but
Joel gives every one of his swim-
mers the conﬁdence to dive in and
leave everything we have in the
pool with every single race.”

Shinoﬁeld has brought new di-
mensions to the women’s training
program, including dry land train-
ing, lifting and running.

“Joel has brought a more in-
tense training program to the
team,” Miata said. “Not only do
we have more pool time, but we
do dry land two times a week all
together as a team, and then we
have running or weightlifting two
times a week that we do in our
spare time.”

Shinoﬁeld’s impact has ex-
tended beyond swimming tech-
nique and training regiments.

“To me, the ideal coach is
someone who knows his swim-
mers on a personal level and can
tell what each and every one of
his swimmers needs, and Joel
does an excellent job of that,”
said Sauter.

New Assistant Coach Kelli
Austin, a recent W&L graduate,
has also helped the women im-
prove this season.

“Our assistant Kelli is great
too, because she graduated only a
short time ago, so she knows ex-
actly what we’re going through,
even academically,” said Miata.

The women return to action
this Friday as they attempt to
win their fourteenth consecutive
ODAC Championship at Radford
College.

THE RING-TUM PHI ° 11

By Russ Weems
STAFF WRITER

A tough slide continued for the
men’s basketball team last week
as their losing streak stretched to
six games.

But the Generals ﬁnally got

; back into the win column last
4 night with an important win over
_Lynchburg.

The win moved W&L’s record
back to 11-11. The team has not
won that many games since the
1990-1991 squad went 12-14.

Senior captain Chris Halkitis

_ led W&L Sunday with 17 points
i on 5-for-8 shooting. Halkitis led
I the team in scoring his freshman

year but this year has spent less
time shooting and more time feed-
ing the ball to W&L’s talented big
men, juniors Greg Bienemann
and Femi Kusimo.

Though Bienemann struggled
during the losing streak" against
frequent double teams, he man-
aged to notch twelve points dur-
ing Sunday night’s win. Kusimo

chipped in nine.

Sophomore forward Kirk
Jones grabbed nine rebounds and
helped the Generals dominate the
glass by a 39-28 margin.

Earlier in the week W&L
played Virginia Wesleyan, Emory

. and Henry, and Hampden-Sydney,
all teams with winning records

and high standings in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.
W&L lost three close games to

Greg Bienemann, Junior

12 points and and 5 rebounds.

18 points and 12 rebounds

some of the most talented teams
in the conference.

W&L went up against their
best opponent to date, the Virgin-
ia Wesleyan Marlins, last Sunday.
The reigning NCAA Division III
national champions have a 19-3
overall record with only one loss
in the ODAC. Midway through
the ﬁrst half, Virginia Wesleyan
only led by one point as the Gen-
erals proved they could play with
one of the premier teams in the
country.

The Marlins went on a run to
claim an 11 point lead, but the de-
termined Generals regrouped and
cut the lead to ﬁve points. W&L
closed the half down ten and
could not get closer than nine in
the second half. Brandon Adair,
the Marlin’s star player, proved to
be a tough task for the Generals as
he scored 29 points.

W&L was led by freshman
Zac White, who scored a career-
high 17 points on 6 for 9 shoot-
ing. The Generals kept ﬁghting,
and the game remained close, but
Wesleyan ended up with a 61-49
victory.

The Generals faced the Emory
and Henry Wasps Wednesday,
losing another‘ close one 100-95.
W&L shot a school-record 73%
from the ﬂoor but committed 29
costly turnovers. The Wasps also
stung the Generals at the line, go-
ing 26-36 from the stripe.

The game was relatively even
until 6:31 in the ﬁrst half, when

   
  
  

  
   

Emory and Henry went on an 18-
5 run to close the half. The Wasps
stretched theirlead to 20 in the
second half.

W&L mounted a gutsy come-
back, closing the gap to as close
as two, but Emory and Henry hit
some crucial free-throws down
the stretch to seal the game. Six
Generals scored in double ﬁgures
for the ﬁrst time in a decade, led
by Bienemann’s 18 point perfor-
mance.

Saturday W&L took on the Ti-
gers of Hampden Sydney. Kusi-
mo and Bienemann combined for
30 points in the General’s 71-60
defeat. W&L had a 5 point lead
near the end of the half, but an-
other late ﬁrst half run hurt the
Generals.

Hampden-Sydney scored 15
of the last 16 points in the half to
take a nine point advantage to the
locker room. The Generals got as
close as seven in the second half,
but when the ﬁnal whistle sound-
ed the Tigers had a victory by 11.

W&L’s offense was work-
ing smoothly early in the game,
but midway through the ﬁrst half
coach Bubba Smith of H-SC had
his team switch to a stiﬂing 2-
3 zone. The zone was effective

when the teams met in Farrnville H

earlier this season, and once again

the Generals struggled to break .1

through.

With W&L’s guards unable to
ﬁnd the big men down in the post,
the team was forced to rain three
pointers over the zone. Unfortu-
nately, W&L shot only 24 percent
from behind the arc.

Though the Generals have been
struggling down the stretch, they
still have a chance to make some
noise in the ODAC tournament.
The team will travel to Guilford

on Wednesday before concluding .

the regular season with a home
game against Bridgewater next
Saturday.

The ODAC tournament begins
on Thursday, Feb. 22 and ends the
following Sunday.

Lovejoy said, ‘The seniors

selves to motivate the team to

a team we haven’t beaten while
I’ve been at W&L.”

Baseball

he Generals, who had an
I 18-15-1 overall record
last season, return with
a strong lineup including junior
outﬁelder James Madden, who
hit .435 with a team-best seven
homeruns in his ﬁrst season as
a starter. Madden has been side-
lined with a wrist injury but will
be expected to make a big contri-
bution when he is able to return
to action.

In the ODAC preseason poll,
the Generals were ranked third
out of 10 teams.

Junior Tim Livingston said,
“We deserve to have high expec-

tations, and we’re eager to fulﬁll
those expectations.”

Seniors Richard Garland, Jor-
dan Wesley, Clayton Edwards,
and Dave Miller along with soph-
omores Terrence McKelvey and
Andrew Henderson are also ex-
pected to be big contributors for
the Generals this season.

Livingston added, “The most
exciting aspect of this season is
that almost everyone will have a
chance to contribute. We’re re-
turning our entire pitching staff,
and we have a lot to prove after a
mediocre 2006.”

The Generals will open their
2007 campaign with a trip to
Pheonix, Ariz. to compete in the
Desert Classic on February 22-
24.

NCAA D-III singles champion
Emily Applegate is expected to

and freshmen Katie Bouret and
Lauren Caire are expected to ﬁght
for the top singles positions.

The team has started indoor

practices and challenge matches
at the Duchossois Tennis Center.
Applegate said, “At this point, we
are just really trying to be focused
and work hard in practice. I think
when matches start we need to
just take it one match at a time
and not look ahead too much.”

Head coach Cinda Rankin has
a simple goal for the Generals in
the 2007 season, “To be the best
team we can be.

The Generals open their season
at home on February 28 against
Hollins. Another squad will be
on the road that day to take on
Lynchburg.

The season will give the Gen-
erals a chance to compete against
nationally ranked opponents,
included long-time rival Emory

University. Emory was the team
that ﬁnally defeated W&L during
the ﬁnals of the D-III chamption-
ship.

As the season begins, the
Generals will be seeking another
chance at the NCAA D-III title.

“We are always right up there

have as good a chance as ever to

said.

College at the Duchossois Tennis
Center. The Generals are a young
team with only one returning se-
nior. The big story for the Gener-
als is junior Tim Ross, who spent
his summer working out and play-
ing lots of tennis and now ﬁnds
himself in the number one singles
spot for the Generals.

Head coach David Detwiler
said, “The pre-season buzz is that
we are a young team with one se-
nior, Jon Malooly, in the top six of

Women’s tennis hopes to Win it all

the singles line-up.”

The Generals played in several
tournaments this fall as well.

A scoring change in NCAA
rules will also change the Gener-
als game plan for the season, as
doubles matches how each count
for one point a piece, as opposed
to the old system where winning
2 of 3 matches resulted in one
point overall.

“Doubles becomes very im-
portant this year and so we need
to improve our doubles skills
in order to insure victory,” said
Bunn.

One of the keys to success for
the Generals this year will be to
keep maintain a healthy, injury-
free team.

Detwiler said, “We already
have had some injuries that are
holding some top players back.
This is making it tough to estab-
lish a true line-up both in singles
and doubles.” .

And as the season begins, De-
twiler is optimistic about the pos-
sibilities.

“We are excited about defend-
ing our ODAC Championship
and returning to the NCAA tour-
nament.”

Leaders of the pack ,

Wrestlers snap Ursinus ’28-game Centennial Conference winning streak.

Before this weekend, Wash-
ington and Lee wrestling was in
the middle of a successful sea-
son, having defeated Ursinus and
Muhlenberg on Feb. 3.

Those teams were considered

the top two in the
W&L 21 Centennial Confer-
NNAS 15 ence, but both fell to
the Generals.

Knowing they couldn’t top the
satisfaction of those two victories
was no impediment to their effort
this weekend, however, as the
Generals continued their winning
ways by defeating Newport News
Apprentice School 21-15.

Saturday moming’s home

match featured ﬁve victories for
the hosts out of ten matches, two
of them by forfeit.

Freshman sensation Sammy
Brusca led the way in the 125-
pound weight class with a 8-6
victory over Kevin Hill.

The win gave Brusca a 14-8
overall record, third-best on his
team.

The Generals also received
wins from David Shubick and
Jesse Sataloff on Saturday.

The team’s strong showing
Saturday was unsurprising, as the
Generals have been improving all
winter long towards this point.

The team had stumbled early
in the season but has lost only
once since January 20”‘, and that
was a one-point decision to Johns

“Across the board we have a lot of kids who

can perform very well. We ’re hoping for at

least four kids to get in the ﬁnals. ”

Hopkins decided only in the ﬁnal
bout of the match.

The team’s growing perfor-
mance was capped in the W&L
Quad meet February 3", where
the Warner Center played host
to the Generals, the'Mules of
Muhlenberg College, located in
Allentown, PA, and the Ursinus
College Bears from Collegeville,

PA.

It was widely expected that
the Bears would have the advan-
tage at the meet, having won the
past four Centennial Conference
championships and having won
27 straight matches entering the
month.

Spring sports preview

Spring sports season promises to thrill W&L sports fans

February break will mark the start of the spring

sports season. Going into the season, both lacrosse

teams are nationally ranked, and both tennis teams

are poised to make a run at an NCAA championship.

Men's Lacrosse

etuming its entire starting
Rdefense and an offense that

will feature two preseason
All-Americans, the Washing-
ton and Lee men’s lacrosse team
looks have a strong 2007 cam-
paign. Sophomores Tim Skeen
and Harry St. John were named as
preseason All-Americans and are
expected to play a large role for
the Generals’ offense.

After graduating two seniors
and one starter from last year,
the Generals have a great deal of
experience going into the season.
Ranked fourth in the ODAC pre-
season poll, the Generals have big
goals to surpass preseason expec-
tations.

Senior captain Chris Lalli said,
“Our goals this year are to win the
ODAC and make it to the nation-
al tournament, with the goal of a
National Championship always
being a motivator.”

On the sidelines, head coach
Gene McCabe will be in his ﬁrst
seasonfor the Generals.

Lalli said, “The addition of
Coach McCabe to our team this
year has all of us excited to be
back out on the field.”

The off-season was a beneﬁ-
cial period for the Generals.

McCabe said, “Our guys
understand the importance of
staying healthy and developing
skills, strength and conditioning
throughout the year. They did a
great job as a unit taking owner-
ship and working hard in the off
season.”

As the season begins, the Gen-

erals willihave high expectations
for themselves, as they strive to
return to the NCAA tournament.

McCabe added, “Our expecta-
tions on a daily basis focus on our-
selves. We work hard to improve
and play to the best of our ability
each day. Success will come to
us if we do that and support each
other throughout the process.”

McCabe is quite familiar with
W&L athletics, having served as
an assistant lacrosse and foot-
ball coach for the Generals from
1998-2001.

McCabe said, “W&L is a spe-
cial place. The people, the tradi-
tions, and the history make it spe-
cial. I do not think there is a better
place in the country to coach la-
crosse.”

Women's Lacrosse

aving been selected to
win a fourth-straight
ODAC championship in

a preseason poll and ranked elev-
enth nationally, the Washington
and Lee women’s lacrosse team
begins their 2007 campaign over
February Break with a trip to Dal-
las, Tx. to take on the University
of Texas.

Senior captain Avery Lovejoy
said, “Starting a new season is al-
ways a lot of fun and a challenge.
We have to work with one another
and learn the strengths and weak-
nesses of the new and old play-
ers.”

Opening the season on the road
will be a chance for the Generals
to come together as a team while
playing a new opponent.

Lovejoy added, “Chemistry
is always a huge part of our team
and we are all very excited for our
trip to Dallas and the time we’ll
be spending together.”

Head coach Jan Hathom said,
‘‘It will be exciting to begin play-
ing games and it is my hope thab
we will play hard and play togeth-
er to accomplish all the goals and
expectations we have set before
us.”

The Generals will be facing
some opponents from Maine as
they take on Colby and Bates. The
Colby game will feature an inter-
esting opponent for Lovejoy, who
will face her younger sister on the
ﬁeld. Bates’ lacrosse coach, Brett
Allen, was also an assistant coach
for the Generals in their 2005 sea-
