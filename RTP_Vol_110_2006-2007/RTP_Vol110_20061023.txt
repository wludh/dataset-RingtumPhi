STUDENTS AND

FOR THE ST

UDENTS SINCE 1897

Alumnus and
former professor
is sworn in as
26th president

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

Under Saturday’s cloudless
blue sky with a cool breeze blow-
ing, Ken Ruscio took Washington
and Lee’s presidential oath of of-
ﬁce.

The inaugural ceremony in-
cluded remarks from many mem-
bers of the W&L community
along with friends and colleagues
of Ruscio.

Ruscio concluded the cere-
mony by addressing the students,
alumni, faculty, friends and fam-
ily on the front lawn of Lee Cha-
pel.

The ceremony, which began at
10:30 a.m., was presided over by
Philip W. Norwood, the Rector of
the Board of Trustees for W&L,
from the class of 1969.

Speaking to the assembled
crowd, Ruscio shared some of his
W&L memories.

He spoke of his ﬁrst visit to
W&L with his father. a college
“he knew almost nothing about”
at the time.

“This particular , moment
would have been far from my
imagination then,” Ruscio joked
about assuming the presidency.

He also talked about being
happy to be back to Lexington,
having left it and W&L in 2002_
to assume the position of Dean
of the Jepson School of Leader-
ship Studies at the University of
Richmond.

“This is home,” he said, and
also said he was “proud to be
back.”

The majority of his speech
recalled some of the history of
W&L and focused on the values
of the liberal arts educational ap-
proach.

“It is humbling to consider the
legacies of past presidents and
consider how I should proceed
from there,” Ruscio said.

He was accompanied on the
speaking platform by ﬁve former
W&L presidents.

These men included Robert
Huntley, who graduated W&L
in 1950, W&L law in 1957, and
served as president from 1968-
1983; John Wilson, who served
from 1983-1995; H. Laurent
Boetsch Jr. from the class of
1969, who served as acting Presi-
dent from 2001-2002; and Tom
Burish, who served from 2002-
2005.

Harlan Beckley, who served as
acting president from 2005-2006,
was also present at the ceremony,

electing to join his colleagues in
the faculty.

Ruscio spent some time focus-
ing on the way the professional
education programs such as busi-
ness, law and journalism are in-
tegrated with the liberal arts ap-
proach to education at W&L.

He said they “come together in
the best way possible.”

Ruscio went on to say he hopes
that the university could leverage
this quality to become even more
of a leader among liberal arts in-
stitutions.

The president also addressed
the future of W&L, speciﬁcally
noting upcoming projects to re-
store the Colonnade, other build-
ing projects, and the continued
strengthening of the school’s
curriculum as goals he is looking
forward to overseeing during the
beginning of his term.

He also spoke of challenges
facing Washington & Lee.

Panel sets the theme of Ruscio is inaugural weekend

educators and alumni kicked off

. homecoming weekend on Friday

with a lively and often humorous
discussion of liberal arts in the
21*‘ century. '

Roger Mudd, a well-known
journalist and member of Wash-
ington and Lee’s class of 1950,
led a question-and-answer session
with Richard H. Ekman, Elizabeth
Kiss, and Pauline Yu.

Yu is president of the Ameri-
can Council of Learned Societ-
ies. Ekman leads The Council of
Independent Colleges, and Kiss
is the president of Agnes Scott
College.

New W&L President Ken
Ruscio introduced the panelists
and said he thought the panel
would shape discussion on the
W&L campus, not just during the
homecoming weekend, but for
years to come.

The panel discussed three top-

cussed the role of faculty~scholar-
ship in a student-centered liberal
arts university, and Ekman talked
about the relationship between
professional education and liberal
arts.

Kiss concluded the prepared
statements by considering how
a liberal arts education imparts
values and promotes the develop-
ments of human intellect.

During the discussion on val-
ues, Kiss said that both she and
Ruscio often get calls from alum-
ni who want their schools to keep
tighter reign on their students’
moral behavior. Kiss said one
alumnus called W&L asking Rus-
cio to stop students from having
sex before marriage.

The panel agreed that no col-
lege or university should exercise
that type of control over their stu-
dents.

Kiss, however, argued that a
college could teach and model the
values inherent in the education
system.

“Ethical inquiry is at the heart
of liberal arts learning,” Kiss said.
“It is inescapable across the dis-
ciplines.”

She said liberal arts education
considers Socrates’ famous ques-
tion of “How ought we to live?”
Kiss followed up Socrates’ ques-
tion with one of her own.

“Do we need to have conver-
sations with students about how
they live their lives?”

ROGER MUDD, Class of 1950

ﬁrst considered the teacher-schol-
ar model at liberal arts schools.
Yu said that the teacher-scholar
model—where faculty members
do both instead of just one or the
other—is worth preserving.

After Mudd asked if one person

could be both a good teacher and
a good scholar, Yu argued that the
best faculty excelled at both. She
taught at several colleges, includ-
ing UCLA, Columbia University,
and the University of Minnesota
before taking her current job. Yu
argued that a true teacher-scholar
had broad intellectual horizons
and knew the past, present, and
future of their professions.
7 ]“You learn best from someone
who is, still leamingf; she said. ,.
Wlliletcher Lowe, who graduated
from W & L in 1954, said that he
remembers best the faculty who
combined the roles of teacher,
scholar, and moral character. His
remarks led several alumni to add
their agreement to that goal.

Ekman said liberal arts schools
beneﬁt from having faculty mem-
bers who are involved in their
students’ lives outside the class-
room.

Before opening the discussion
to questions, the panel considered
how the liberal arts ﬁt together
with professional education. As
the undergraduate journalism
school and the Williams School
of Commerce, Politics, and Eco-
nomics continue to grow at W&L,
the topic grows increasingly im-
portant.

Ekman said it was too easy-
but also incorrect—to assume that
there is an inevitable conﬂict be-
tween liberal arts and professional
education.

“The subjects we teach as lib-
eral arts change over time,” Ek-
man told the other panelists.

Yu said W&L and similar in-
stitutions need to see professional
and liberal arts as complementary,
not conﬂicting, ideas.

The ﬁnal question from the
audience set the tone for the pan-
el’s conclusion. Several people

wanted to know how they could
best explain the value of a liberal
arts education to people in the real
world.

One should keep graduating

the students one has been gradu-
ating and send them out as testi-
monies to this model of educa-
tion, Yu said.

Kiss said many large univer-
sities are now mimicking liberal
arts schools by creating smaller
colleges inside the larger univer-
sity. Ekman took some time dur-
ing the post-panel reception to
discuss another problem for lib-
eral arts schools: high costs.

“College is expensive,” Ek-
man said, “but most schools work
to control costs wherever they
can, and schools like W&L raise a
ton of money for scholarships.”

Ekman said American students

graduate with an average debt of ’

 J. .. .a-.....r... ..

“ls that an unreasonable ex-
pense?” asked Ekman. “I would
argue not.”

After the panel had ended,
Mudd discussed the values he
took from W&L into his profes-
sion.

‘ He served as the congressional
and national affairs correspondent
and weekend anchor for CBS’s
“Evening News” before working
as co-anchor of NBC’s “Nightly
News” and “Meet the Press.”

Mudd said W&L’s honor sys-
tem was the most valuable thing
he took away from his education.

“This honor system had a his-
tory to it that had lasted and got-
ten stronger through generations,”
Mudd said. “A man’s word was
his bond, and by God I wasn’t go-
ing to be the one to let [the sys-
tem] languish.”

Mudd said the values he took
from the honor system helped
him immensely when he went
into journalism.

He said he hopes the values that
he and his classmates cherished in
1950 are still important to today’s
students. While he said American
society and culture have changed,
he said W&L’s honor system re-
mains relevant.

“The values that W&L be-
lieved in then and now have not
changed,” Mudd said. “What the
honor system did then and now
is clear away the underbrush in
your relationships with people 
it makes everything cleaner and
clearer.”

Commons promotes artist .

Ron Herd, a Memphis artist, visited campus last Wednesday as a part of the “Common
Grounds’ series, which turns the Commons into a coffeehouse for a few hours.

While Tom Goss played the guitar, Herd greeted students and explained his theories on art. ‘‘I
use my art in particular to break down all types of walls and barriers that people put up,” he said in a

commons press release.

He also talked with different passersby about casual topics, like the upcoming NBA season
and college sports. His art, which he says is influenced by everyone from Vincent Van Gogh to Tupac,

“If we look beyond the bor-
ders of our ivory towers...the
picture [facing our students] is
daunting,” said Ruscio.

“Our obligation is to model a
democratic culture of civility and
trust for them.”

“We should never underesti-
mate the challenge” of educating
both the mind and the character
of our students, warned Ruscio.

. Reactions to the president’s
address were overwhelmingly
positive, with alumni, faculty
and students alike calling it “out-
standing,” “inspiring” and “ex-
cellent.”

For example, alunmus James
Parsons from the class of 1948
said, “It was an‘excellent speech
towards the greatness of W&L
and its future.”

Harold Howe, who graduated
with Ruscio, said he was amazed
at the thought of one of his class-
mates becoming president of the

. university and is looking forward
to Ruscio’s term.

Lettingthe democrats have it_

Losing in November means Republicans have a chance at the White House when the election really matters

By Cody Beauchamp
c o LU M N I sr

t ﬁrst glance, things are
going horribly for the
Republicans.

Iraq is a complete ca-
tastrophe. Afghanistan is slipping
back into a state of instability
and violence. Congress is being
rocked by ethics scandals courte-
sy of Jack Abramoff’s illegal lob-
bying. The Bush administration
just took yet another broadside
from Bob Woodward’s new book
“State of Denial.”

To really take the cake, one
of their own, former Congress-
man Mark Foley, has completely
alienated the evangelical Chris-
tian faction of their base by pull-
ing a Michael Jackson on teen-
aged congressional pages.

And yet the Republicans
couldn’t be in a better position.

I know it sound nuts, but hear
me out. The Republicans are
golden... in 2008.

It’s an all but sure thing that
the GOP will lose their majority
in either the House or the Senate,
or both.

But this is precisely where

I... aura-« .._

the light at the end of the tun-
nel comes for the Republicans.
They’re going to get a break from
being in charge.

They need it.

Whenever things go wrong in
politics, it’s always the party in
charge that catches the heat.

Look at what happened in
1932. Furious at President Hoover
and the Republicans’ inability to
end the Depression, voters _swept
FDR and Democratic majorities
in both Houses into power.

In 1980, with gas prices soar-
ing and the Iranian Hostage Cri-
sis unresolved after nearly a year,
Ronald Reagan soundly beat J im-
my Carter, bringing a Republican
Senate Majority with him.

In 1994, Newt Gingrich’s
“Contract with America” capital-
ized on long-running Democratic
slips and scandals, mobilized vot-
ers, and gave the Republicans
control of both Houses of Con-
gress.

And so on.

The bottom line is that if things
aren’t going well, the heads in
charge tend to roll.

This is certainly the case this
election.

 

 

TRAD

LIF

T he diﬂerence is, it ’ll be 2008
and the White House will be up
for grabs along with Congress.

There are multiple Senate rac-
es where the incumbent Republi-
cans are expected to lose: Jim Tal-
ent in Missouri; Conrad Burns in
Montana; Mike DeWine in Ohio;
Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania;
Lincoln Chafee in Rhode Island.

The House is much the same
story. An Oct. 2 CNN/ORC poll
shows Democrats leading the
Republicans by an average of 11
points nationwide.

Slate’s Election Scorecard
(as of last Friday) is predicting
Democrats will unseat Republi-
can incumbents in the 8th district
in Arizona, the 7th in Colorado,
2nd, 8th and 9th in Indiana, 11th
in North Carolina, 1st in New
Mexico, 26th in New York and
10th in Pennsylvania while win-
ning open races in the 16th dis-

trict in Florida, 24th in New York,
and 15th in Ohio.

. So why is this impending wave
of losses such a good thing for the
Republicans?

Because it sets them up per-
fectly to win the White House
again in 2008.

Right now the Democrats
aren’t really running as Demo-
crats. They’re running as anti-
Republicans. This is ﬁne for now.
It will most likely capitalize on
voter frustration and swing con-
trol of Congress back to the left
of the aisle.

But what then? With no real
solutions of their own to any of
the major issues, the Democrats
will ﬁnd themselves facing the
same criticisms the Republicans
currently are facing.

The difference is, it’ll be 2008
and the White House will be up
for grabs along with Congress.

The war in Iraq will still be
going horribly. Oil shortage prob-
lems still won’t have been solved.
Iran will likely have nuclear
weapons by then (North Korea
apparently already does). We’ll
still be seeing threats from terror
cells worldwide. Et cetera.

So in two years we’ll be seeing
the same things happening—an—
gry at the lack of leadership from
the party in control, we’ll play
another round of “vote the bums
out.”

Only this time, it’ll be the
Democrats getting the boot.

The problem for the Democrats
will be when they get the boot—a
presidential election year.

Anyone doubt that Bush would
be unseated if he were running
NOW? Didn’t think so.

Anyone think that voters frus-
trated with a lack of progress
from the Democrats in Congress
will still be willing to vote blue in
when it comes to the next presi-
dent? Exactly.

It’s a lot like chess: lose a

the next one. Whether or not they
want it, the Republicans are about
to let the Democrats try their hand
at leading Congress.

And the Democrats are going
to self-destruct.

The GOP has platforms and
ideas that they want to see hap-
pen. The Democrats only have
one idea: gripe about the GOP’s
leadership.

Name the potential Republi-
can candidates for president: John
McCain, Rudy Giuliani, Bill Frist,
Mitt Romney, Condi Rice-—the
list goes on.

Now try naming Democrats
with a shot. Mark Warner? Not
anymore. John Edwards? Maybe.
Nancy Pelosi? Harry Reid? John
Kerry? Hillary? I scoff.

The bottom line is that one
of two things has to happen for
Democrats to win in 2008.

It won’t be enough to be the .

anti-Republicans in 2008, espe-
cially not if they get two years in
charge.

Either they have to miracu-
lously snatch defeat from the jaws
of victory in 2006 or they have to
actually start having some ideas
for how they want to govern.

  Politic ally

Baker commission on Iraq delays results after election

By Dylan Merrlll
c o L u M N I s r

Clearly, victory in Iraq is im-
possible.

Many Democratic members
of Congress have held this view
since the beginning of the insur-
gency, and their patriotism has
consequently been under ques-
tion.

Their detractors have unfairly
accused Democrats of aiding ter-
rorists and impeding the spread of
democracy. Contrary to conserva-
tive notions, though, Democrats
have not been having sleepovers
with Osama bin Laden, and they
probably haven’t pledged their al-
legiance to the Dark Lord.

Grandpa Cheney and Uncle
Bush have repeatedly alluded
(sometimes not so subtly) that the
Democrats want to gain a major-
ity in Congress this November so
that they can misguide America
even further.

In reality, however, many
Americans want a change in
Iraq foreign policy, and they are
no longer willing to “stay the
course.” In addition to Demo-
crats, many politicos, even some
of Bush’s conﬁdants, from both
sides want a change in Iraq for-
eign policy.

The Iraq Study Group, whose
10 members are headed by the
ﬁrst Bush’s Secretary of State
James Baker, is developing a
report on what is the most effec-
tive course of action in Iraq. The
commission, which was initiated
by congressional Republicans and
sanctioned by the White House,
will most assuredly advocate a

Contrary to conservative notions,
Democrats have not been having
sleepovers with Osama Bin Laden.

change in direction.

Their two main options will
shift focus on either stabilizing
Iraq or withdrawing troops in
multiple phases. Both alternatives
of the supposedly bi-partisan
commission reject the notion that
our efforts can cultivate democ-
racy in Iraq.

Luckily for Republican sup-
porters of “staying the course,”
the ﬁndings of the Iraq Study
Group will not be released until
after the election. The excuse
for this clever cover-up is that the
conclusion of the group’s research
is too “politically explosive” to
release before Nov. 7. If only the
Bush administration was as adept
at preventing explosions in Iraq.

After all, the war is the most
important issue in the upcoming
midterm elections. If the com-
mission’s ofﬁcial ﬁndings pub-
licly rebuked the current policy
before the elections, congressio-
nal Republicans would have no
chance to save face.

Their well-funded campaigns
would go under like a storm-rav-
aged luxury yacht succumbing to
the deep blue sea. And the results
would be fatal, because Mark
Foley stole the life rafts a couple
of weeks ago, and Democrats will

I scapegoating Baker,

conveniently forget how to swim.

Fortunately for right-wingers,
their president has delayed their
demise until after Nov. 7.

The results of the commission
will be released after the elec-
tions, but this still does not lessen
the negative impact the ﬁndings
will have on Republicans. Those
conservatives that avoid the com-
mission’s political gunﬁre this
election will still have to bite the
bullet in 2008 and face their con-
stituents.

This is not even the extent of
the GOP’s worries. The Iraq war
will continue to be the deﬁning
issue during the next presidential
election.

If George Bush does not re-
linquish his ideological dogma-
tism and adopt the ﬁndings of the
Baker commission, voters will
look at the quagmire in Iraq and
ensure that his replacement is a
Democrat.

Will the president stoop to
a family
friend, or will he adopt the ﬁnd-
ings of the commission and ﬁnal-
ly alter the course in Iraq? The
Republican party’s power is con-
tingent on his actions.

So is the vitality of the Ameri-
can people.

Football needs
student support

Ten reasons why you should go to the big game

The Generals play Bridge-
water on Saturday at 1 pm.
Here’s why fans should at-
tend:

It has been eons
since we won an
ODAC title

In fact, the last time we
won a title outright, none of
the players were even born (it
happened in 1981).

It’s only an hour
away

It’s simple: Drive up 81,
take exit 240, and follow state
Route 257 until you hit cam-
pus. Now you have no excus-
es about getting lost.

We're in college.
It’s what you're

supposed to do

You watch ESPN’s “Col-
lege GameDay” on Saturday
mornings. Don’t you want to
taste a little piece of normal
(read: D-1) college life? Paint
your face, drink some beer (if
you’re over 21) and get out

there.

They come here

Is anyone else just a little
embarrassed that other teams
manage to garner some seri-
ous supporters at our home
games? Go defend your turf!

Little Vamer is still fresh
out of Alabama high school
football, and he doesn’t have
the experience yet. Let’s go

And quite a few Wash-
ington and Lee teams have
made it there in recent years.

do the math.

Colton for Heisman

The kid can do it all: he
runs, he catches, he returns
kicks. When the team needs a

number one on the team in

our hearts. And number one

We think not.

playoff games

If we win one of the next
two games, we’re in. Watch-

The crowd is a
deciding factor In

any game 

Think about the golden
days of Green Bay football,
when they were virtually
unbeatable at home, partly
because of the intimidating
crowd noise. It feels so much

Mass murder in Darfur

A look into whether we should interfere with a repeat of the Holocaust

Darfur has been embroiled
in a deadly conﬂict for over
three years.

At least 400,000 people have
been killed,‘ more than 2 million
innocent civilians have been
forced to ﬂee their homes and
now live in displaced-persons
camps in Sudan or in refugee
camps in neighboring Chad

More than 3.5 million men,
women, and children are com-
pletely reliant on international
aid for survival.

Not since the Rwandan geno-
cide of1994 has the world seen
such a calculated campaign of
displacement, starvation, rape,
and mass slaughter

Since early 2003, Sudanese
armed forces and Sudanese gov-
ernment-backed militia known
as “Janjaweed” have been ﬁght-
ing two rebel groups in Darfur:
the Sudanese Liberation Army/
Movement (SLA/SLM) and the
Justice and Equality Movement
(JEM).

The stated political aim, of
the rebels has been to compel
the government of Sudan to ad-
dress underdevelopment and the
political marginalization of the
region.

In response, the Sudanese
governments regular armed
forces and the Janjaweed
— largely composed of ﬁghters
of Arab nomadic background
~ have targeted civilian popu-
lations and ethnic group from
which the rebels primarily draw
their support — the Fur, Masalit
and Zaghawa.

We read about the horrors of
the Holocaust and wonder how
it could ever happen.

We read the story of what
happened to Elie Wiesel and
are ﬁlled with utter disgust and
dismay. The senseless, ruthless,
and diabolical extermination of
innocent men, women, and chil-
dren is something we say we
cannot accept.

And yet, we allow the Su-
danese to create over 2 million
more Elie Wiesels and worse,
400,000 victims who could nev-
er tell their story.

People are dying in Darfur,
and we do nothing.

We study the other genocides
that occurred during the 20“‘
century.

We study how the Turks
nearly wiped out all Armenians
and now the world is left with
little Armenian culture.We blast
the world community for not
doing enough to stop the geno-
cide of Rwanda in the ‘90s. And
yet, our generation, like every
other generation, seems doomed
to repeat history.

People are dying in Darfur,
and we do nothing.

We promote an organization
said to guarantee world peace
and stability. The UN stops
countries from going to war
with each other, but not from
going to war with themselves.

We deplore war. We think
being peaceful with every-
one would create a peaceful
world. We forget that appease-
ment with brutal men has never

worked. We say we want peace,
but we can’t come to terms with
the paradox of ﬁghting for it.

Nazi Hunter Simon Wiesen—
thal once said, “It’s a terrible
tragedy when a good man does
nothing.” The terrible part of
the tragedy called Darfur is not
what is happening, but what we
good men are not doing about it.
People are dying in Darfur, and
we do nothing.

The UN has peacekeeping
missions around the world.

And yet there is still no sig-
niﬁcant mission to speak of in
Darfur. Why?

Because the Sudanese gov-
ernment, the very same gov-
ernment that is carrying out the
genocide, can legally block a
peacekeeping mission aimed at
stopping genocide.

People are dying in Darfur,
and we do nothing.

We elect our leaders to be
the leaders of the free world. In
the past few years Congress has
taken an aggressive stance on
the right to speak nonsense in
order for a bill not to pass — ﬁli-
buster - when 15,000 Darfurians
are silenced each month.

They have fought to the bit-
ter end for one woman’s right to
live on life support when there
are hundreds of thousands of

Darfurians who have no real life
to support.

The Bush Doctrine wel-
comes democracy in the trou-
bled areas of the world and this
is wonderful. But isn’t a more
immediate matter the protection
of life itself?

People are dying in Darfur,
and we do nothing.

So we fast, we raise money,
we listen to rich celebrities and
we “contribute to the cause.”

All this is well and good, but
are we really doing something?
They’re still dying in Darfur and
as long as the inhumane beasts,
for lack of a crueler word, are in
power, people will die.

We are the strongest nation
this world has ever seen.

With one swift attack we’ve
taken down entire armies. With
a few words of encouragement
and some aid, we have helped
millions of people obtain free-
doms once thought impossible.

We can and have a responsi-
bility to stop genocide, to eradi-
cate those who eradicate.

Do we not have the power,
the right, and the obligation to
stop this?

Or is that we just don’t have
the will?

People are dying in Darfur.
Let’s do something.

Staff writer Julie Von Stem-
berg interviews various alumni
about their experiences back
on campus. Some offer nos-
talgic emotions while others
speak of how the college tradi-
tions have changed since their

years at the university.

Homecoming Football Game

On Saturday afternoon, alumni cheered
on another General’s victory. The Washing-
ton and Lee Generals crushed the Gilford
Quakers 34-12, making them six and one for
the season. During halftime, Kathekon mem-
bers Jordan Wesley and Palmer Dobbs con-
ducted the traditional homecoming presenta-
tion. Before announcing homecoming queen,
W&L’s oldest alums, including 89-year-old
Charles Luther Guthrie Jr., were honored
by fans. Guthrie presented the homecoming
envelope that revealed Shari Boyce as third
runner up, Camille Allen as second runner
up, Katy Kingsbury as ﬁrst runner up and
Meghan Joss as queen. Jim Ferrnald, of the

class of 1973, named several things that have changed about the game since
he was a student. “First of all, everyone didn’t leave during halftime. That is
quite different. Also, the presentation has changed. When I was here, chemistry
professor Shilington always presented the homecoming queen envelope. His
eccentric personality made him perfect for the job,” says Fermald.

 

Seeing Old Friends

For most alumni,
being reunited with old
classmates is the best
part about coming back
to Washington and Lee.
A variety of activities
such as the Inaugural
Lunch and the Five Star
General Reception gave
alumni the opportunity
to come together in cel- .
ebration of their time
here. During these gath-
erin_gs, classmates were
able to reﬂect on old times as well as learn about each
other’s lives after graduation. Mark Grobmyer, who
graduated last year, appreciates the chance to see his
old classmates. “The best thing about being back is the
atmosphere,” said Grobmyer. “It’s great to be in a care-
free environment and with 50 of your best friends. That
doesn’t happen very much now that we’ve graduated.”

Up ‘til Dawn funds research

Students write letters, organize fundraisers to earn money to support children is cancer research at St. Jude Hospital

By Queenle Wong
surr wrmsn

Every year, the campus orga-
nization Up ‘til Dawn conducts a
series of fundraisers to encourage
cancer research at St. Jude Hospi-
tal in Memphis, Tenn.

The organization, currently
headed by Executive Director Erin
Vaughn, plans to raise $35,000 by
the end of this year.

Up ‘til Dawn, according to
stjude.org, is a student-led ﬁind-
raiser hosted by over 150 colleges
and universities nationwide. Since
its creation in 1998, the program
has generated close to $3 million.

Amanda Eysert, a Washington
and Lee graduate, established the
campus chapter last year. Despite
its late start, the organization suc-
cessfully raised $20,170, said
Vaughn.

The funds were donated to the
American Lebanese Syrian As-
sociated Charities (ALSAC), the
primary fundraising group for St.
Jude.

The organization is comprised
of 10 or 11 executive board mem-
bers, who recruit volunteers from

W&L’s Greek community. The
volunteers are then organized into
different ﬁindraising teams. These
teams are given the opportunity to
conduct their own activities.

Sophomore and former team
leader Rosemary Boyle helped
raise approximately $1,000 last
year by selling rafﬂe tickets. With
the help of 25 W&L students, par-
ticipants in the fundraisers won
dates, said Boyle.

Although a similar fundraiser
has yet to be scheduled, Boyle
said that it will probably occur
sometime after Thanksgiving
break.

Another one of Up ‘til Dawn’s
major ﬁandraisers is a letter-writ-
ing night. During the event, stu-
dents write letters to their friends
and relatives, encouraging them
to make a donation to ALSAC.

Sophomore Jennifer Lysenko,
who spoke about her cousin’s
battle with cancer last year, was
pleased with the huge number of
participants that attended.

The event will be held this
Tuesday, Oct. 24 at 7 p.m. in
Evans Dining Hall. All students
are welcome to participate, said
Vaughn.

Nonetheless, in order to en-
sure attendance, students are
also asked to register prior to the
scheduled date. Students may
register by e-mailing Vaughn or
simply showing up on Tuesday.

According to Assistant Direc-
tor Kelly Harvey, Up ‘til Dawn is
expecting approximately 100 stu-
dents to attend this function.

The organization is thinking of
instituting a second letter-writing
event in January.

With funding from the Execu-
tive Committee, the organization
is able to conduct other fundrais-
ers as well, said Harvey. These
include selling baked goods and
$15 on campus. All proceeds go
directly to ALSAC, she said.

During spring term, Up ‘til
Dawn ends their fundraising year
by literally staying up until dawn,
said Boyle. '

Last year, the event, -which
celebrates the organization’s

achievements, was held at the
school gym and included a band
among other activities. This tradi-
tion is celebrated nationwide and
is where the organization’s name
arose from, states the website.

In addition to its fundraising
aspects, the organization strives
to promote cancer awareness
throughout campus.

“lt’s about bringing the W&L
community together and letting
[the students] know that there
are bigger problems out there,”
Vaughn said.

Harvey stressed the leader-
ship aspect of the organization in
her interview, stating that Up ‘til
Dawn “allows students to take on
small leadership roles.”

St. Jude, according to its web-
site, is unlike any other hospital
because it treats admitted patients
regardless of their ability to pay.
This makes St. Jude the third
largest health care charity in the

United States.

“During the past ﬁve years,
83.7 percent of every dollar re-
ceived by ALSAC/St. Jude has
gone to the current or future needs
of St. Jude,” states the site.

According to Vaughn, the
campus chapter of Up ‘til Dawn
is continuing to grow.

This year, the organization,
which consists of 20 fundraising
teams, plans to host a total of ﬁve
fundraisers, she said.

Said Harvey, “We know
that the money is going to good
hands.”

Senior exhibits rare talent

Abbie Jackson spends summer months researching university archaeology, revamping previous exhibition

By Jessica Shaw
ARTS AND LIFE EDITOR _5

Over the summer, some stu-
dents embarked on various intern-
ships, and others held down nu-
merous jobs. Some worked with
children at summer camps, while
still others studied abroad.

For senior Abbie Jackson, last
summer was not spent at a typi-
cal summer job or a doctor’s of-
ﬁce. For two months, Jackson
remained on campus to conduct
archaeological research involving
the history and development of
Washington and Lee.

“Coming to college, I wanted
to work in a museum, so this was
the perfect combination of inter-
ests,” Jackson said.

Under the guidance and super-
vision of Archaeology professor
Laura Galke, Jackson completely
revamped the previous archaeol-
ogy exhibit located in the Anthro-
pology Lab by the Liberty Ruins.
Jackson’s exhibit opened to the
public last Friday.

“It’s deﬁnitely a great oppor-
tunity that everyone should look
into,” Jackson said.

“The goal was to have it de-
signed so that in the future it
could be implemented by a pro-
fessional, but the fact that it’s in
is kind of surprising. It was nice
to see my work complete—to see

the panels life-size.”

According to Jackson, the mis-
sion of the project was to refurbish
the old research and artifact lay-
out as well as complement it with
subsequent research and ﬁndings
from the spring Archaeology Dig
she participated in in 2005.

, “We were redoing the exhibit
which focused on the Liberty Hall
excavations of the 1970s,” she
said. “The goal was to incorpo-
rate the Newcomb excavations of
2005 to show that campus archae-
ology is not dead.”

Jackson began her work in late
June and ﬁnished in mid-August.
She said there was no strict out-
line for her project.

“We had a general plan for the
summer, and I just went at it," she
said. “I did historical research on
the college using the Board of
Trustees records, the Lexington
Gazette [and] the old Phi article.

“Then, I moved onto my inter-
site analysis, which was between
the Ruins and the Newcomb ex-
cavations, because both buildings
had similar uses.”

Galke, who is in her fourth
year at W&L, said that after the
Dig, she knew Jackson would be
a great student for such a project.

“During the Dig, I had iden-
tiﬁed her as a student I wanted
to work with,”’ Galke said. “She
was a hard worker. She was intel-

ligent. She had the right attitude.
She’s critical and skeptical, [and]
she doesn’t accept things at face
value.”

The Robert E. Lee grant that
funded Jackson for her research
and efforts this summer was sup-
plemented by the generous assis-
tance of Leybum funds.

“A lot of people helped us,”
Galke said. “We could not have
done it alone.”

Galke also said that the com-
mitment of Anthropology profes-
sor Dr. Bernard Means was criti-
cal to get the exhibit renovations
underway.

“He helped supervise the dig
beside Newcomb in 2005,” she
said. “He already was familiar
with the collection, and he was
familiar with my work. His dedi-
cation [was crucial in] translating
Abbie’s ﬁles into a format that
they could be manufactured.”

Jackson said another goal of
this project is illustrating how the
archaeological evidence collected
affects the validity of historical
documents. She is also eager for
others to get a true understanding
for the campus and its history.

Galke said she hopes that “vis-
itors that come here take away an
appreciation for how important
the university’s history is and
how much the university cares
about preserving it.”

Every morning, John rises ear-
ly to board a bus from D.C. for an
hour and a half to his job at Bob

starched, collared shirt and neatly
combed hair, John waits tables
and cleans dishes all day. Aﬁer
work, he returns to his home on

he collects the blankets he keeps
hidden in the bushes in the me-

fort to stiﬂe the wind and freezing

poverty where the basic needs of
shelter and food are a day-to-day
concern.”

Sophomore Michaela Coffey
was in charge of this opportunity
and split the team up into pairs for
their stay in D.C. These students
left campus the Thursday of read-
ing days at 8:30 a.m. with nothing
but a set of ragged clothes.

Sophomore participant David

Vaught said that he and his part-
ner, sophomore Alden Wicker,
found some piles of ashes around
the Georgetown campus and used
them to rub over their faces and
skin and improve the credibility
of their outﬁt.

“Alden and I spent a good bit
of time the ﬁrst afternoon going
‘we’re still not dirty enough yet,”’
Vaught said. “We kept improving
our costume. There was one point
where we pulled out a knife, and I
cut some holes in the ankles of my
pants to make them look older.”

During the day, the pairs stood
on corners in D.C. with cardboard
signs, panhandling for money.
Some groups also sold the home-
less magazine, Street Sense, to
passersby.

“Being homeless is almost like
a full time job,” junior participant
Woodrow Friend said. “I didn’t
really expect that. Panhandling
all day long was not anything that
was easy. A lot of people give you
nasty looks or stare. One person
said something like, ‘I don’t give
money to street trash.’”

Vaught said the only time he
almost broke character was in re-
sponse to some boys while pan-
handling.

“I saw these two guys that
didn’t look much older than me,”
he said. “I just got mad by the way
they ignored me. They would look
at me and see no obligation to do
something. For some reason, that
really bothered me.”

Later in the afternoon, Boyle
and her partner, Friend, gathered
on a street corner with a small
crowd to wait for McKenna’s
Wagon, which serves dinner to
the homeless.

Boyle noted the parting re-

marks from the delivery man that '

seemed to accentuate the cycle of
poverty.

“When he was packing up to
leave, he said, ‘see you all tomor-
row.’ He knows that everybody is
going to be back,” she said.

When asked about their own
situations, each pair had to invent
some sort of response.

“I basically tried to avoid the
question,” Friend said. “I usually

did that by asking another ques-
tion. I kind of thought the sim-
plest thing I could think of was
best. I thought being more distant
about your situation being home-
less was more in character.”

After dinner, the group of
nine divided into two groups for
the evening. One group spent
the night with a homeless couple
in the woods on the outskirts of
town while the other convened
with John to sleep on the street.
The two groups rotated for the
second night.

Vaught’s group spent the night
with John the ﬁrst night.

“He looked really clean for
a homeless man,” Vaught said.
“The way he was dressed and
the way he was clean, he could
have passed for a lower—middle
class citizen-someone who had
been wearing the same clothes
for a day or two and a little dirty.
You didn’t look at him and think
‘homeless’ for sure.”

Both nights, the temperatures
dropped to levels that bordered on
freezing. Vaught said he slept the
ﬁrst night with an oversized piece
of cardboard positioned over him
to block the wind.

“I put newspaper in my shoes,
and I put my feet in a trash bag
I had been carrying around all
day,” he said.

Sophomore participant Kasey
Bolles said John’s situation had
arisen from excessive misfortune.

“He used to live in North or
South Carolina, and one night his
house burned down to the ground,
and he lost everything,” she said.
“He can’t afford the cost of living
where he is, but he can’t afford
to go anywhere else, so he’s just
stuck.”

Boyle said that she noticed
John had a strong desire to rise
out of poverty.

“He was having a tough
week,” she said. “To hold down
a job, he is facing a huge amount
of obstacles daily. He hopes soon
that he will be able to get some-
where to live.”

The other location, out of
town, had to be reached via the
Metro. The homeless couple that

the groups stayed with, Michelle
and Zoe, slept in tents in a wood-
ed area.

Vaught described the arrange-
ment saying, “they had palates on
the ground to put tents on and had
a campﬁre and a few egg crates
with a board across it to sit on.”

Vaught said the couple had
bought some marijuana and al-
cohol that day, and Zoe had alco-
holic tendencies.

“He slept until ll o’clock the
next day and got up and went to
the liquor store to get something,”
Vaught said.

Referring to homeless people,
Vaught said, “They do have a
life to live with struggles to go
through, and while some deﬁnite-
ly do drugs, I came away thinking
I don’t want to judge that in the
ﬁrst place.”

Vaught said he believed the
plight of the homeless was much
deeper than an addiction.

“I didn’t feel like drugs was
the root of the issue—maybe part
of it,” he said. “It’s not that people
who don’t do drugs are better at
getting out of homelessness; it’s
the people who want to get out
of homelessness ' that don’t do
drugs.”

According to Boyle, D.C. has
a lot of organizations that help ﬁx
the symptoms of homelessness
but few that actually work to cure
it permanently.

“There are plenty of organiza-
tions that provide food, but as far
as equipping the person with the
ability to escape homelessness, I
didn’t encounter any,” she said.

Vaught said that this trip has
changed his view of poverty.

.C. to be immersed in homelessness, try to gain fresh perspective on poverty

“I don’t ever want to overlook
a homeless person sitting there
panhandling,” he said. “These
people are poor and needy. It’s
a chance to notice somebod --
they get overlooked their whole
lives.”

Bolles agreed that she learned
a lot from her experience but ac-
knowledged that 48 hours was not
enough time to establish complete
empathy for the homeless.

Said Bolles: “You don’t real-
ize how vulnerable you are until
you are out there,” she said. “It
was enough to take the blinders
off, but it was not enough to get
[an] understanding [of what it is
like] to live that way indeﬁnitely.
I can’t even imagine that being
your way of life—-with no indica-
tion of if ‘or when you will ever
get out of it.”

Volleyball 1

The Washington and Lee
women’s volleyball team
clinched their ninth-straight
20-win season, improved
their record to 21-6 overall
and kept their perfect 9-0 re-
cord in ODAC competition.
This weekend the Generals
defeated Bridgewater College
30-26, 19-30, 30-25, 31-29,
and Eastern Mennonite 30-20,
30-17, 30-24. In their victory
over Bridgewater, the Gener-
als were led by senior libero
Lauren Edmonson, who tied
her own school record with
33 digs.

Fleld Hockey

The Washington and Lee ﬁeld
hockey team scored another
big conference victory this
weekend, before having their
seven game winning steak
snapped by sixteenth-ranked
Christopher Newport. The
Generals defeated ODAC
powerhouse Virginia Wesley-
an 2-1 on Saturday, with Liz
Garson and Kay Dyt scoring
goals. The Generals will take
their undefeated ODAC re-
cord upon against rival Lynch-
burg College on Tuesday,
where the conference regular
season championship will be
on the line.

Men's Soccer

The Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team relied on
a second half barrage of four
goals, to shut out Randolph-
Macon 4-O, improving their
record to 11-1-2 and 6-1-1 in
ODAC play. The Generals
were led by goals from Jack
Palmer, Alex Phillips, Whitt
Larkin, and Travis Short. The
Generals will close out their
regular season on Wednesday
when they take on Lynchburg
College.

Women’s Soccer

The Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team contin-
ued their l6-game undefeated
streak, knocking off Roanoke
College 2-1. It was only the
ﬁrst goal that the Generals had
allowed for the entire season.
With the score tied 1-1 senior

. Sarah Helms scored the game

winning goal in the 76th min-
ute. The Generals will close
out their regular season with a
chance to capture the ODAC
regular season crown on Tues-
day against Eastern Menno-
nite at 4 p.m. on Watt Field.

Golf

The Washington and Lee

golf team ﬁnished third of p
11 teams at the Transylvania
Invitational, held over reading
days in Lexington, Kentucky.
The Generals were led by
junior Nathaniel James, who
shot a 150 to ﬁnish in ﬁrst
place as the overall medalist.
The Generals were also led by
Joe Gibson and Anthony Zap-
pin, who shot a 161 and 162
respectively over the two day

tournament.

as EMU is ranked ﬁfth overall
in the Adidas/NSCAA coaches
poll,;the Generals are l7“‘) to ac-
complish the impressive feat of
not allowing a single goal in the
entire regular season.

The streak is impressive in
itself, but it doesn’t overshadow
the overall spectacular season
the Generals have enjoyed. The
streak just adds greater distinction
for a team that has yet to lose, and

on Tuesday faces its biggest game
of the season, home at Watt Field
at 4 p.m.

The ODAC has come down to a
triangular race between Guilford,
ECU and W&L, with W&L sitting
in third with 28 conference points
through ten ODAC games. ECU
is second with 27 points through
10 games, and Guilford sits atop
the conference with 28 points,
although their regular season is
over and their destiny is now out
of their hands. Everything hinges

on the game on Tuesday.

With a win, W&L wins the
division outright with 29 points
(three points are awarded for a
win and one for a tie).

With a tie, W&L will ﬁnish
third, and the division will be
sorted out through a tie breaker
between the other two. If past
performances are an indication
of how Tuesday will turn out,
the Generals tied Guilford 0-0 on
Oct. 4‘, and Guilford lost to EMU
3-2 on Sept.20. EMU will not be

intimidated by the Generals’ for-
midable defense.

W&L will rely on the same
cast it has relied on all season.

Forming the backbone of the
team are their eight seniors: Em-
ily Binns, Cara Burton, Jamie
Dorsey, Maggie Megear, Huntley
Rodes, Blair Haws, Sarah Helms,
and captain Anne Wiltshire.

That group hopes to return to
the ODAC championship, a place
they haven’t been since their ca-
reers at W & L began as fresh-

man.

A return to prominence means
stout defensive play, as has been
the norm all season.

Anchoring the back is sopho-
more goalkeeper Kiki Moreo,
who last year minded the net dur-
ing the then W&L record-setting
12-shutout season.

While on Saturday the team
proved it could win without blan-
keting their opponents, a 16th win
would suit the Generals’ fans just
ﬁne on Tuesday.

A close look at the Fall Classic

Andy, Neil discuss America is pasttime and make predictions about the World Series

Andy: Hi, hello, and welcome to
this week’s OutLoud. The world
of sports offers many possible
topics to talk about.

Unfortunately, many of the re-
cent events that would be worth
writing about are about lower-
ing our standards, lowering it to
the lowest common denominator,
rather then holding ourselves to
higher expectations.

Incidents such as the Miami
and Florida International ﬁght
two weekends ago are inexcus-
able and unacceptable, and that’s
all I am going to say about that.

The best spectacle in profes-
sional sports just got underway on
Saturday night: the World Series.

Baseball is described as Amer-
ica’s pastime, and rightfully so.

The World Series has been
held every year, with two excep-
tions (1904, 1994) since 1903.

Originally, it placed the team.

with the best record in the Ameri-
can League against the team with
the best record in the National
League.

In 1969, this changed with the
institution of the league cham-
pionship series, and once again

changed in 1995 with the institu-
tion of the wild card and the divi-
sional series.

Enough talk of the history for
now.

Some individuals believe that
the baseball season is too long
and too boring, which detracts
from the World Series.

I say that is absolutely ridicu-
lous.

Baseball and the World Series
are sports at its purest. A seven-
game series removes the potential
for a ﬂuke victory, as in the NCAA
College Basketball Tournament,
and does not hype one game at
a neutral site to decide the whole
outcome as in the Super Bowl.

Each game is equally as im-
portant, with both teams having
to play in hostile environments in
order to secure the crown.

What makes the World Series
even more interesting is the sto-
ries of how the teams got there.
The Tigers’ return to greatness
and the Cardinals’ second trip in
three years are just a few of the
stories lines that might be heard.

The St. Louis Cardinals make
their 17”‘ appearance in a World

Series while the Tigers make their
l0“‘.

I want to challenge all sports
fans to tune in and watch it. It
should be a great series, one of
the better ones in recent years.

In addition, this series features
two historic managers, an MVP
candidate, and a team that has
gone from worst to ﬁrst in a mat-
ter of a few years.

What to Watch this Week:

0 Generals Football at Bridgewa-
ter on Saturday at 1pm.

(Make the trip or listen on 91 .5FM
WLUR.)

0 The World Series on FOX

Neil: A Cardinals-Tigers World
Series is just what the doctor or-
dered for baseball.

It gives people a chance to re-
member a time in baseball when
stars shone just a bit brighter and
all was just a bit better.

The Cardinals and Tigers met
in the 1968 Fall Classic and,
just like this year’s World Series
is bound to be, it was an instant

classic.

The Cardinals went into the se-
ries as the defending champions.
Game one pitted Bob Gibson, one
of the greatest pitchers of all time,
against Denny McLain, who won
31 games in 1968.

The spotlight would be stolen
from McLain. He beat Bob Gib-
son in the deciding game seven
and ended up with three com-
plete game victories and the MVP
award. His outstanding perfor-
mance in game seven brought
the Tigers back from a 3-1 series
deﬁcit and handed them their ﬁrst
title since 1945. '

Detroit next won in 1984 as
Allen Trammel led the Tigers to
an easy ﬁve-game win over San
Diego. Can the Tigers win in
2006?

All signs point to a Tigers vic-
tory, just three years after they
lost 119 games.

They are led by young, ener-
getic players. They can hit, they
can ﬁeld and, most importantly,
they can pitch.

Led by the Gambler, Kenny
Rogers, and Justin Verlander, the
Tigers’ pitching staff is the key to

the Tigers’ success.

Just as in 1968, no city de-
serves a World Series victory
more than Detroit. In 1967, De-
troit suffered through massive
riots that were only surpassed by
the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
The city was torn apart, but the
Tigers rallied the city and healed
a lot of wounds.

Detroit is faced with other
problems now. -

The American auto industry is ’

ﬂoundering and they are run by a
mayor, who is probably corrupt
and apparently throws some of
the best parties in the country.

All Detroit has going for it
these days is its sports. The Wol-
verines (University of Michigan)
lead the way, the Pistons are great,
the Red Wings are the reason De-
troit is called Hockey Town.

Even the WNBA’s Detroit
Shock is one of the best around.

Now, the Tigers are hopefully
going to rise back on top, which
is a spot they deserve to be.

Their Prediction:

THE RING-TUM PHI - 11

  Taking Frisbee

' to the next leve

Two Dead Guys going strong as they enter ﬁfth year

 

 

By catherlne Carlock
srArr wmrrn

The offense scores in the end
zone and receives points, and the
two competing teams peel off to
their respective ends of the ﬁeld.

Think you know what’s com-
ing next? A kickoff, right?

How about a throw-oﬂ‘?

That’s right, a throw-off.

To many, Frisbee is a recre-
ational sport that can be played in
the BDG quad or on the Colon-
nade. However, to a certain group
of students here on campus, Fris-
bee is more than just a leisure ac-
tivity used to pass the time.

Welcome to Two Dead Guys
(named after, ironically, Wash-
ington and Lee), one of the most
established club sports at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Ultimate is “a mix between
soccer and football,” said junior
President Adam Hoehn.

The premise is simple—get
the Frisbee into your team’s end
zone.

Players accomplish this by

passing the discs down the ﬁeld,

but there’s a catch: Once the play-
ers catch the Frisbee, they aren’t
allowed to move.

Ultimate is a club sport, which
leads to a “pretty positive atmo-
sphere,” said junior Annie Vlieg-
enthart.

“You get the opportunity to
play a pretty serious sport, but if
you don’t have time to come, they
don’t get mad,” Vliegenthart con-
tinued.

\

“The guys are really great. T hey just want

people to come and play with them. ”

AMY KARWAN, Two Dead Guys

Besides the “great team inter-
action,” according to Vliegent-
hart, Ultimate offers the opportu-
nity to make lasting friendships.

“My best friends are the peo-
ple on the team,” said alum Matt
Kianski, who helped found Two
Dead Guys with fellow alum Tim
Smith in 2002.

Kianski graduated last spring
and was in town for homecoming
weekend.

2006 marks Two Dead Guys’
ﬁfth anniversary, and Kianski
thinks “it’s impressive the team
has survived.”

Kianski and fellow alum Tim
Smith legitimized Ultimate as a
club sport in 2002.

Before that, they played pick-

.up with friends. In November
2002,.W&L hosted a.4-team tour;,..'

nament, with local teams JMU,
Radford, and Liberty.

Two months later, W&L at-
tended their “ﬁrst real tourna-
ment,” with around 16 teams, ac-
cording to Kianski.

W&L usually sends around 15
people to each tournament.

“Generally smaller col-
leges will play each other,” said
Hoehn.

Minks ﬁght
until the end

Rugby team hangs tough with
Division 1 opponents

By Joel Poelhuls
STA FF W RITE R

The Washington & Lee
Screaming Minks have made a
habit of playing teams that over-
match them in division, experi-
ence, and program size. From
teams in Argentina last spring to
the traditional Lee-Jackson game
against Division I VMI, the team
seems to be a glutton for punish-
ment as far as their competition
goes.

This tough schedule, however,
has enabled them to go undefeat-
ed in the conference and earn a
berth in the Ed Lee Invitational.
It should be no surprise, then, that
the Minks played up to the level
of visiting Divison I opponent
Virginia Tech on Saturday after-
noon.

The Minks scored ﬁrst, but
then Virginia Tech scored three
times in a row—twice in the ﬁrst
half and once in the second.

The Minks battled back from
the deﬁcit and scored within the
eight minute mark, but were un-
able to pull out the victory, losing
by three.

“It was a game we prob-
ably should have won,” freshman
Christian Remmel said. “We had
a three week layover from the last
game, including reading days and
midterms, and the intensity wasn’t
quite what it could have been the

whole game.”

The team is now back prac-
ticing hard for their last regu-
lar season game (away versus
Longwood on Oct. 28) before the
Ed Lee Invitational tournament
brings a close to the fall season.
Longwood is also undefeated in
the conference.

Captain Tino Tovo said the
team will stick to its game plan in
the post-season.

“We want to keep things sim-
ple and focus on the basics,” he
said.

With most of the season in
hindsight, Tovo was able to reﬂect
on the improvements the team has
made.

“Overall, not just this season
but the last three years we have
had a lot more consistency: 23
to 25 players who show up and
come to practice on a regilar ba-
sis,” Tovo said.

“We don’t have people who
don’t come to practice much and
then show up at games,” Tovo ex-
plained. “That makes a big dif-
ference.”

After the fall season draws to a
close, the Minks will take a break
until practices for the spring start
in February.

The spring season will begin
in March, and at its conclusion,
the team has tentative plans for
a rugby tour in Europe similar to
last year’s trip to Argentina.

Whoever wants to come is
welcome, and Two Dead Guys
are always looking for new mem-
bers.

Ultimate is a coed club sport,
Amy Karwan knows what it’s like
to be “the girl” on the team, even
though Ultimate is a coed sport.
She’s “played two tournaments as
the only girl.”

“The guys are really great,”
said Karwan. “They just want
people to come and play with
them.”

Two Dead Guys has already
played at a tournament in Gettys-
burg, Pennsylvania, and they will
head to a tournament in Guilford
later on in the year.

The team practices every

Tuesday and.Thursday on..the.law-. ~
school ﬁeldiand every Sunday in“;

the open area next to the soccer
ﬁeld.

Each’ practice generally lasts
an hour and a half and is evenly
divided between drills and scrim-
mages.

“Frisbee is the greatest sport in
the world,” said Kianski. Those
on the Two Dead Guys Ultimate
team tend to agree.

The stories you didn’t see

Lewis remembers athletes whose deaths didn ’t make headlines

ByAdam Lewls
COLUMNIST

Just last week, tragedy struck

in Manhattan as New York Yan- ,

kees pitcher Cory Lidle and
his ﬂight instructor crashed a
small plane into a New York
City building, leaving both men
dead.

As I
am sure
you all
have
heard or
read, Li-
dle was
known
for being
a great
man,
both in baseball and in his small
California community, and hear-
ing of his death brings sorrow to
the ears of every American.

However, not to take any-
thing away from this terrible
loss, I would, at this time, like to
take the opportunity to acknowl-
edge and honor the deaths of
several athletes.

These are athletes whom
you may not have heard of, who
passed away last week, and who
were as much a part of their
small communities as Lidle was.
However, they did not capture
headlines or cover stories on
newspapers.

Travis Davis. Travis was an
honor student, All-State wrestler,
and a football player at Harding
High School in North Carolina,
and was looking forward to at-
tending college in the fall.

 

Family and friends describe
Travis as a great kid with a re-
markable smile, one that will
never escape the minds of those
who knew him.

Tragically, on his way home
from a visit with his girlfriend,
Travis was shot and killed, for no
reason apparent to authorities.

Haris Charalambous. Haris
was a University of Toledo bas-
ketball player who was known
more as a person than an athlete.

Friends remember his unique
friendliness and personality, as
he seemed to always be in a good
mood.

Nonetheless, he died this past
week of a heart condition while
practicing with his team.

About 750 people attended his
memorial service, all of whom
regarded the service as a celebra-
tion of the life of this remarkable
student-athlete.

F errnin Vialpando. As a high
school football player in Colorado
Springs, Colo., Ferrnin was rec-
ognized as a well-liked kid, who
was extremely easy to talk to.

His family recalls his high
aspirations that extended beyond
the football ﬁeld.

Friends remark that Ferrnin
had an unmatchable attitude on
and off the ﬁeld, and coaches
wished they could have had an
entire team of people like him.

Yet, due to an unidentiﬁed
heart condition, Ferrnin collapsed
on the football ﬁeld and eventual-
ly passed away last week, deeply
affecting the lives of those who
knew him.

Jamie Bliss. A junior at

I would, at this time, like to take the opportu-
nity to acknowledge and honor the deaths of

several athletes whom you may not have heard

of yet who passed away last week.
 

Caldwell High School in New
Jersey, Jamie, like the previ-
ously-mentioned students, was
the type of kid parents, coaches,
and friends felt privileged to have
known.

Jamie was a football player,
and had just recently been award-
ed the “Hustler of the Week” for
being the hardest worker during
practice, something that was very
special to him.

However, to the devastation of
his community, Jamie randomly
collapsed on the ﬁeld last week,
and having showed no past signs
of heart problems, suffered car-
diac arrest.

Each of these student—athletes
was tragically taken from the
world this past week, and I hereby
dedicate this article to them, their
families, and their communities.

Each is a hero in his own way.
Corey Lidle was to the baseball
community, these young men
were for their respective schools
and towns. They will all be
missed.

And while I do apologize for
the sorrowful sentiment of this
article, I would just like to take
a moment now to reﬂect on a
personal hero of mine, who was

a student-athlete just like these
great young men, and whose death
brought grief to my community
nearly eleven months ago.

David Gibson. When you
think of someone with a personal-
ity, multiply that by about ten and
you will get David.

In about every memory I have
of him, there is a smile on his
face, and an amazing smile at
that, either from a joke he made,
from a humorous incident that
just occurred, or just simply just
because.

David was a tremendous
swimmer, and he planned to con-
tinue swimming in college.

However, because I never
swam, my memories of David
are on the soccer ﬁeld, where he
proudly boasted an extreme lack
of skill, but enjoyed it just the
same.

On Nov. 28 of last year, David
was killed in a car accident, just
seconds from his house, where
the next day his mother received
his acceptance letter to Albright
College, his number one choice.

On that day, my town of
Montville, N.J. lost a truly joyful
person, and he will be eternally
missed.

Homecoming heroes

Football team continues six—game winning streak by crushing Guilford ,,

By Brian Devine
STAFF warren

Coming into Saturday’s game
against Guilford, Washington and
Lee football players thought they
had a pretty important incentive

to win. It was, af-

SD ter all, the annual
W &L 34 homecoming game,

complete with the
Guilford 12

largest crowd of the
season, a host of
alumni returning to Wilson Field,
and the eyes of the university
upon them.

That was all before the Bridge-
water Eagles lost to Emory and
Henry, a result that was broadcast
over the stadium’s Public Address
system at halftime, with the Gen-
erals leading the Quakers 10-3.

After that, the necessity to win
on homecoming took a back seat
to the opportunity to get a leg
up on their primary competition
for the ODAC championship.
Bridgewater, the pre-season fa-
vorite to win the conference and

a team ranked 11”‘ in the nation at
one point, had now lost two con-
secutive conference games.

W&L, picked by most to be
the second-place team in the con-
ference, would have zero confer-
ence losses with only two ODAC
contests left in the season if they
could ﬁnish off the Quakers.

The Generals led with a de-
fense that pressured Guilford
quarterback Josh Vogelbach into
throwing three interceptions and
dozens of forced errant passes, as
well as sacking him three times;
Vogelbach threw for only 218
yards, his lowest total of the sea-
son, and he completed only 25 of
56 passes. Guilford’s offense had
more turnovers (three) than scores
(two). The secondary of Kyle
Luby, Jimmy Gift, Mark Snoddy
and Chris Prugar shut down the
Quakers’ receivers with an equal
blend of knockdowns and crush-
ing hits that caused receivers to
drop easily caught passes. Nearly
every pass play in the second half,
Vogelbach would set up to throw,

see all of his receivers covered
downﬁeld, be pressured out of the
pocket by a consistent pass rush
and force a throw into a covered
receiver to be knocked down. All
in all, it was a solid defensive ef-
fort.

While the Generals’ defense
was its usual menacing self, the
offense might have worried some
before’ the game. Running back
Stuart Sitterson, the workhorse of
the team’s rushing game, would
be limited to four carries by an
ankle injury. Instead, the work-
load fell to dependable fullback
Ty Parrino and do-everything se-
nior Colton Ward, who inspired
chants of “Colton for Heisman”
after a 79-yard touchdown recep-
tion in the fourth quarter.

Ward, officially listed as a
V-back in the Generals’ media

guide, was effective as a runner '

(28 yards), receiver (145 yards)
and return man (116 yards).
While Ward’s contribution was
invaluable, the fans will certainly

remember best a trick play run by,

Driven to succeed

Team stillperfeet in ODAC with win against Va. Wes

By Joel Poelhuis
smrr WRITER

Field hockey fell 3-0 to the vis-
iting Christopher Newport Cap-
tains Sunday, ending their seven —
game winning streak. Though the
team fell to 13-4 overall, they still
possess an undefeated 7-0 record
in the ODAC with the tournament
approaching.

Head Coach

Sn Wendy Orrison
W &L 0 said, “I thought we
showed some posi-

CNU 2 tive things [in re-
gard to the postsea-

son]. They were really fast

and they used it to capitalize off
some errors in our backﬁeld. . .It’s
nice to have a hard game like this
right at the end of the season to
prepare you for the tournament.”
CNU entered the game 9-3
and in need of a win for their own
tournament bid. The Captains are
ranked third in the region by the
NCAA, and are 16th in the nation
according to the coaches’ poll.
The Generals had also just
come off a comeback win against

Virginia Wesleyan on Saturday.
Down 1-0 with under three min-
utes to play, the Generals scored
two goals, ﬁrst from sophomore
Liz Garson and then from ju-
nior Kay Dyt to pull ahead and
save their undefeated status in

' the conference. Va. Wes. was the

only team last year to prevent the
Generals from going undefeated
in the conference. Last time the
Generals defeated Va. Wes, it was
2002.

Sunday’s game against CNU
was scheduled to be the last of the
regular season for the Generals,
but the game against Lynchburg
was delayed, setting up an inter-
esting scenario.

Lynchburg is the other team
in the ODAC with an undefeated
record. On Tuesday, the Generals
will travel to Lynchburg to play
for the top seed in the upcom-
ing ODAC tournament. Which-
ever team wins the top seed will
have home-ﬁeld advantage in the
semiﬁnals. This is critical since
Lynchburg plays on a grass ﬁeld
while the Generals play on turf.
The difference between these two

surfaces will play an appreciable
role for teams in the tournament.
The tournament begins Sat. Oct.
28.

In preparation for the tourna-
ment, Orrison says things have
been “business as usual.” Tra-
ditional end-of-season practices
including more playing time for
underclassmen or more condi-
tioning training are not out of the
ordinary.

“We’ve been in the top four

for the last four years,” Orrison _

explained. “The team expects to
be where we are and expects to
win. 1 think it’s a good thing to
get used to; it helps give everyone
conﬁdence.”

Playing the bench is one of
Orrison’s ways both of respond-
ing to the fast paced nature of the
game on turf, and of developing
younger players’ skills and conﬁ-
dence.

Throughout the regular season,
the Generals have managed to
post some impressive statistics.

They hope to convey this, suc-
cess in the post-season this up-
coming Saturday.

the Generals with 1:15 left in the
ﬁrst quarter. Three different play-
ers touched the ball in the back-
ﬁeld before freshman quarterback
R.J. Vamer threw a 29-yard pass
to Jack Martin to take the lead.
Vamer had another solid outing
(11 of 16 passing, 3 TD) after
taking over from regular starter
Hunter Dawkins (out for the sea-
son with a broken collarbone)
three weeks ago.

Martin was doub1e—covered
through most of the game but still
managed 71 yards receiving and
two touchdowns.

With the Generals ﬁring on all
cylinders, it is within their grasp
to win the conference. While
most in the stands did not realize
it, if the Generals beat Emory and
Henry on Parents’ Weekend, they
will clinch the ODAC title and a
berth in the Division III post-sea-
son.

Next week, the Generals will
play pre-season favorites Bridge-
water, who now need a small mir-
acle to win the conference.

Any fan of Washington and
Lee women’s soccer must regard
the teams 2-1 win over Roanoke
on Friday as bittersweet. There
seems little to complain about
beating a team that entered the
contest with a 10-4-1 record, ex-
cept that the bar set by W&L’s
defense in its ﬁrst 16 games was
more than just high, it was perfec-
tion.

Had the Generals not yielded
a goal to Roanoke’s freshman
forward Margaret Houston in the
33” minute, they would have only
had to shut out Eastern Memo-
nite Tuesday (albeit no small task
