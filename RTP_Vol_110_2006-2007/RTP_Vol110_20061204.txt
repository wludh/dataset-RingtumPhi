Fire damages students ‘country house,
but none of the occupants are injured

By Alden Wlcker
STAFF WRITER

Junior Phi Psi and swimmer
Alex Sweet lost all ofhis belong-
ings when his off-campus house
caught ﬁre last Wednesday.

“Basically, my room was sub-
merged in flames,” Sweet said.

Sweet and his two housemates,
Bret Cogan and Chris Pow, have
also been forced to move out of
their house at Beans River Bot-
tom. The house is now unin-
habitable after the ﬁre gutted a
downstairs bathroom and Sweet‘s
bedroom.

The ﬁre started in the bath-
room when Pow's towel got stuck
in the small electrical heater--
which Pow had left turned on--
below the towel rack and caught
ﬁre. Within 15 minutes, the ﬁre
moved through the drywood walls
and up into Sweet’s closet above
the bathroom.

Cogan was in his second sto-
ry bedroom checking his email
around 8 am. when he smelled
smoke.

“I opened my door and it was
white with smoke. You could not
breathe or see,” he said.

He ran out to the balcony and
called 911. Then he jumped off.
He went back inside and tried to
put out the ﬁre with a ﬁre extin-
guisher, but he realized that most
of it was inside the walls.

Meanwhile, Sweet was just
getting out of class and got the
message from Cogan saying the
house was on ﬁre. He rushed
home.

“On the way I heard all these
sirens, and I was like ‘Dammit,"”

Country needs to quiet down

Sweet said. “I knew those were
for my house.”

When he got there, there were
ﬁve engines from three different
stations attending to the ﬁre.

The ﬁre engulfed Sweets bed-
room. It moved from the closet to
his bed, blew out the windows.
and burned his other closet. It
climbed the wall and bumed
through the roof.

Now the room is a charred
black hole.

“My TV got melted in half."
Sweet said. “I lost every article of
clothing I have."

His ﬁsh were also burnt alive
invtheir ﬁsh tank.

“They died a pretty terrible
death,” he said. “I feel really bad
about that.”

Although he was lucky enough
to have his computer and books
with him, Sweet thinks his grades
will probably suffer, especially
since he lost thousands of note
cards he had made up for his bio-
chemistry class.

There was also “tremendous
water damage” to the whole
house. The ﬁre department cl1ain-
sawed a hole in Sweet‘s roof and
put hoses in to put out the ﬂames.
The downstairs was damaged by
smoke, with holes smashed in the
walls where the ﬁre department
checked for ﬂames. Plaster, dry-
wall, and mud covered the floor
where the ﬁreﬁghters trooped
through.

“It is completely unlivable."
Sweet said.

The house’s exterior looks nor-
mal, except for a boarded up win-
dow upstairs and an inconspicu-
ous tarp stretched over the hole in

the roof. According to the ﬁre de-
partment, there is about $50,000
worth of damage to the house. It
won‘t be renovated and ready to
live in again until next year.
Sweet and Cogan have moved
into a suite in Gaines Hall for the
remainder of the year. Pow moved
into 21 KA house at Beans Bottom
with his fraternity brothers.
Although Pow was the one who

leﬁ the heater on, his housemates
don’t blame the ﬁre on him.

“None of us are mad at Chris,”
Sweet said. “We don’t blame him;
it was a mistake anyone could
have made.”

Pow would not comment.

Sweet thinks the blame rests
with the poor upkeep of the
house.

“My house was a matchstick

waiting to erupt,” he said. “I re-
alize now it was really stupid to
live there.”

He hopes this will serve as
a wake-up call to students who
move into run-down housing.

“I will be more diligent to
check that kind of thing,” Sweet
said.

But Cogan, who did not lose
anything in the ﬁre, is just happy

the landlords are not angry at
them.

“They have also been really
easy to work with,” he said.

When Sweet’s mother helped
the boys move their stuff into the
house, she tried to tell the boys
the house was a ﬁre hazard.

“My mom told us ‘This place
is going to burn down,’” Sweet
says. “Sure enough, it did.”

Supervisors say noisy students must continue working to find common ground with their neighbors

By Jacob Geiger
N EWS EDITOR

Julia Garrett is one of the
neighbors bothered by the student
parties on Windfall. She lives
across from Winding Way Road
— the driveway that goes to the

_ Windfall Hill houses.

“The music gets tumed down,
but the [Traveller] buses keep
running until 2 am. and there is
a roar of voices,” Garrett said.
“This goes on Wednesday through
Saturday. What I want to empha-
size is that when the music stops,
the party is not over.”

Country parties are safe again
alter the Rockbridge County
Board of Supervisors decided last
Monday not to pass a tougher,
more restrictive noise ordinance.

Instead, the board will let
students and their neighbors try
to work out a solution that satis-
ﬁes all groups. But the supervi-

-sors warned that students living

on Windfall Hill and at the Pole
Houses must keep working with
their neighbors if the current
peace is going to hold.

“If the students behave and the
neighbors are satisﬁed, we will
leave things alone," said Harvey
Hotinger, the supervisor who rep-
resents the area around Windfall
Hill and the Pole Houses. “We
are just trying to make the neigh-
bors happy.”

Garrett said that she would be
happy if the compromise between
students and neighbors works, but
she said some serious problems
need to be addressed.

Repeated complaints by neigh-
bors who live near the student
party areas prompted the board
to consider a much stricter plan.
The proposed ordinance would
have required a permit for parties
with loud music or more than 30
people.

“lfthe students behave and the neighbors are

.s'ati.sﬁed, we will leave things alone. We are just

trying to make the neighbors happy. ”

HARVEY HOTINGER, Rockbrldge County Board of Supervisors

The ordinance also would
have harmed music and other loud
noises after 10 p.m. on weeknights
and after midnight on weekends.

Students and administrators
from Washington and Lee turned
out Monday night to argue that a
new noise ordinance was unnec-
essary Most of the people from
W&L have been serving on the
Community Campus Coalition, a
group Director of Student Health
Jane Horton started last fall with
Dean of Students Dawn Watkins.

Executive Committee Presi-

dent Rob Rain told the board
he was concerned that a stricter
ordinance might drive a wedge
between students and the com-
munity.

“Since the student body be-
came fully aware of the serious-
ness of this issue, many steps have
been taken to resolve this issue in
a civil manner,” Raid said during
his speech to the board.

Garrett Clark, a sophomore
who will be living on Windfall
Hill next year, is a member of the
coalition. He asked the board to

postpone action on the ordinance.

Clark also said he thought
the proposed ordinance was far
too broad. He said the ordinance
could have unintended conse-
quences that would harm other
residents of the county.

Clark said that if county resi-
dents want to have a weekday
party, under the proposed ordi-
nance they would have to register
the party and then send everyone
home at 10 p.m.

Residents who live near the
student houses said the coalition
had been working hard to ﬁnd
common ground. The coalition
held a meet-and-greet earlier this
month for at the Pole Houses for
students and neighbors. Another
dinner is planned for Wednesday
night on Windfall Hill.

David Dugan said he went to
the ﬁrst meet-and-greet dinner
and was pleased with the results.
“Allow us and the students to con-

tinue to work together,” he said.

Don Ford, who lives near
Windfall Hill on Woodridge Lane,
said he had seen a difference in
student behavior this year.

“I hope things continue to

improve,” he said. “I would not
mind giving the students more
time if they continue being seri-
ous.”
Neighbor Ed Bauer told the
board to enforce the ordinance it
has now. “Bring [the proposed
ordinance] back up if problems
continue,” he said.

The coalition has also invited
landlords and law enforcement
ofﬁcials to share their input.

Joe Shaner, the landlord for
Windfall Hill, told the board that
he has enjoyed good relationships
with his student tenants.

“We are now renting to the
second generation in some cases,”

Stopping sexual assault I

Summit gathers student leaders from 15 schools to discuss ways to reduce campus assaults

the numbers
behind sexual
assault at W&L:

 

college-age women will
suffer rape or attempted
rape from the time of their
14th birthday.

In the past year,

 

of female W&L students
reported sexual touching
against their will. This is

 

the national average.

In a recent survey of
the student body asking
students to classify various
scenarios as “rape” or “not
rape," women and men
differed significantly

  %

of the time.

Relations Committee

enior Matthew Loar is a
busy guy.

After all, combating
 sexual assault takes time
and heart.

Loar, Chairman of the Gender
Relations Committee, Co-Chair
of 1 in 4, and a volunteer at the
Project Horizon women’s crisis
center, gets his motivation from
an experience close to home. A
female friend of his was raped
while in high school but didn’t
tell anyone about it until college.

“Her situation really struck a
chord with me, and it made me
realize that since I had the power
to make some change, I needed
to,” Loar said.

Part of his work is running
the GRC. Its programs like Date
Night and Candycane grams are
designed to promote healthy gen-
der interaction. Loar’s latest proj-
ect was a GRC—sponsored summit
at W&L designed to “bring stu-
dents and administrators together
from other universities to collab-
orate on efforts to prevent sexual
assault.”

He characterizes the summit as
a big success. “We brought more
than 50 people together from 15
different schools. We spent the
weekend discussing programs,
successes, obstacles to success,
and a myriad of other topics re-
lated to sexual assault.”

    

He especially enjoyed the all-
student discussion group. “It was
refreshing for me to see so many
other students who cared about
this issue. Everybody was very
enthusiastic about taking back
new ideas to their campuses.”

The event’s. keynote speaker
was the national founder of 1 in 4,
a men’s group that educates men
about sexual assault and how to
help survivors. It takes its name
from the statistic that one in four
college-age women will suffer
rape or attempted rape from the
time of their 14th birthday.

Chapter Co-Chair Bill Larson
believes l in 4’s presentations
and sponsorships are paying off.

“The number of sexual as-
saults at W&L seems to have
lessened slightly and awareness
has improved. . .but there is still a
lot to be done.”

Larson believes sexual assault
is offensive to the “honor and ci-
vility inherent in the W&L com-
munity. All members of the com-
munity should work to end sexual
assault on our campus.”

Junior Paten Hughes, the pres-
ident of Knowledge Empowering
Women Leaders (KEWL), says
getting people involved is an im-
portant part of the solution. “We
have to ﬁnd a way to penetrate
the culture, to work within it.”

KEWL sponsors monthly dis-
cussion forums--including one
on sexual assault--and is selling
T-shirts in the commons atrium

“Every group at this university has the power

to  alter the kind of environment that fosters

the behavior that leads to sexual assault. ”

Matthew Loar, chairman of the Gender Relations Committee

 

for charity. KEWL’s mission is
“to form a community of great
women who are leaders, who are
smart, who have things to say.”

Getting women to speak out is
also the goal of SPEAK, a wom-
en’s organization educating wom-
en about sexual assault. SPEAK’s
membership has tripled since its
first meeting, and it produced a
video and program to present to
all freshmen women in the fall.

SPEAK President Catie Ful-
ton said, “We want women on this
campus to be aware of the vari-
ous resources available to them
if they or a friend have been as-
saulted. Talking about sexual as-
sault. . .is one of the ﬁrst steps, in
my opinion, towards eliminating
the problem.”

In addition to presentations to
freshmen, SPEAK sponsors pro-
grams like Take Back the Night, a
vigil against sexual assault featur-
ing survivors.

University Counselor Jenni-
fer Sayre points to W&L’s high
sexual assault rate as evidence of
a problem.

Theta Pi wants to

re-colonize on campus

Members of the last pledge class say they felt betrayed by Beta nationals

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF wmrrn

They’re bringing Beta back.

Yep.

The Beta Theta Pi fraternity
hopes to re-colonize a chapter at
Washington and Lee University,
conﬁrmed J.B. Scherpelz, the
organization’s Director of Expan-
sion and Recruitment.

Scherpelz (representing the
fraternity) and Jason Rodocker
(representing the University as
Director of Student Activities and
Greek Life) both conﬁrmed that
preliminary discussions were al-
ready underway about the possi-
bility of Beta re-colonizing.

The chapter was suspended
from campus in 2004 for hazing
incidents.

University Director of Re-
ligious Life William C. “Burr”
Datz, who was involved with in-
vestigating the hazing allegations,
declined to comment on what
speciﬁc hazing acts of which Beta
was accused.

According to both Datz and
Rodocker, the fraternity was
found to be in clear violation of
University anti-hazing policy and
was accordingly suspended for a
period of one year.

Rodocker said that the fra-
temity’s national ofﬁce handed
down a longer suspension to the
chapter, refusing to allow any
sanctioned activity until all of the
members of Beta at the time—in-
cluding the pledge class who had
been hazed—had graduated the
university.

Barring an unexpected compli-
cation, this would mean the sus-
pension would be lifted sometime
next year--by which time all pre-
vious Beta members are expected
to have graduated.

Rodocker said that the repre-
sentatives from the national of-
ﬁce said re-colonization could
happen shortly after. However, he
also said the national organization
wants to see what they consider
to be a strong alumni base that
would support the new chapter.

Rodocker also said the na-
tional ofﬁce has several concerns
that will need to be adressed. The
national executives are interested
to see if the chapter can sustain it-
self without reverting back to its
previous behavior.

Scherpelz said that Beta’s na-
tional organization also hoped to
see greater involvement by the re-
colonized chapter in regional and
national leadership seminars.

The fraternity’s website de-
scribes their “Men of Principle”
initiative as one that hopes to give
“a new voice to the enduring val-
ues of our Fraternity. . .calling on
men to become leaders and giv-
ing them the tools they need to do
so.”

Scherpelz said that the nation-
al organization will also stipulate
that the chapter house property be
completely dry, although he said
that this would not necessarily
mean the fraternity ‘chapter itself
would have to be dry.

Scherpelz said the ban would
only forbid alcohol on the physi-
cal grounds and property of the

“T he chapter that was suspended is not what a

Beta chapter, in the eyes of our national orga-

J

nization, should be. ’

J.B. Scherpelz, BOI1 Director of Expansion and Recruitment

 

chapter house, with possible ex-
ceptions for certain social func-
tions.

Scherpelz also added that po-
tential new members would have
to maintain a grade point average
higher than the W&L all men’s
average to receive a bid and go
through new member education.
The average male GPA at W&L
is a 3.159.

“We are anxious to return, but

if we do, we want to return as an ‘

organization that contributes and
is a valuable part of a community,
not a chapter that behaves like
the one that was suspended did,”
Sherpelz said.

“We are anxious to meet with
the university’s Inter-Frater-
nity Council and Student Affairs
Council in the spring to see how
we can go about doing that.”

To Ted Clark and Matt Leis-
man—both of whom were mem-
bers of the last Beta pledge class
before the fraternity was suspend-
ed——the stipulations are likely
going to make re-establishing the
chapter more difficult.

“If it’s going to come back
with those rules, they’re going to
have a hard time rushing people,”

said Clark.

Leisman believes any new
chapter would not see much in-
volvement from any pre-suspen-
sion brothers.

“I think all of us felt betrayed
by nationals,” said Leisman.
“None of us really want to help
them out much.”

“It’s sort of an issue too of
them not wanting to be involved
with us than us wanting to be in-
volved with them,” said Clark.

Scherpelz conﬁrmed that was
the national fratemity’s position,
saying that while he feels that
what happened to Clark’s and
Leisman’s pledge class was “un-
fortunate and deﬁnitely unfair,”
the fraternity’s national board had
already decided at the time of the
suspension that the class would
not be welcome in any future re-
colonization efforts.

“The chapter that was suspend-
ed is not what a Beta chapter, in
the eyes of our national organiza-
tion, should be,” said Scherpelz.

“When the chapter closed, it
was for very good reasons,” said
Scherpelz. “It is deﬁnitely regret-
table, but no one involved with
that is really welcome back.”

“Our numbers are higher than
national averages, which is why
we’ve been working to develop
educational programs that will
resonate with our students,” she
said.

Sayre points to the “hook-up
culture” as a major cause of the
miscommunication which can
lead to sexual assault.

If you are sexually assaulted,
Sayre encourages you to go to the
Health Center. “There is always a
physician and counselor on call.
We can explain all of a student’s
options, attend to medical needs,
and establish a support structure
to start the process of recovery.”
A university counselor will even
stay with the student if he or she
decides to go to the hospital.

For sexual assault survivors
seeking justice or mediation
through the university, there are
several options.

“A formal report can be sub-
mitted through me, a CAIR (Con-
ﬁdential and Impartial Resolution
resource),” said Dr. Sayre, “or
directly to a Designated Ofﬁcer,

such as a dean. CAIRS are won-
derful resources and can advise a
student about a range of options
from a formal report to less for-
mal resolutions.”

CAIRs are faculty and staff
members trained to assist students
with problems involving sexual
misconduct. Survivors may also
go to the Student-Faculty Hearing
Board to seek justice. It is a con-
ﬁdential body that may impose a
variety of sanctions. It does not,
however, enforce Virginia law.

Sayre explained that “to be-
gin the process of ﬁling criminal
charges, the police must be con-
tacted. If a student is making a
criminal report immediately fol-
lowing an incident, it would be
best to go to the Health Center so
that a counselor can accompany
the student... for formal evidence
collection.”

As for the future, Sayre would
like to see “our entire community
come together to end sexual vio-
lence on our campus.”

Loar agreed. “Every group
at this university has the power
to. . .alter the kind of environment
that fosters the behavior that leads
to sexual assault.”

He considers Greek participa-
tion vital, “particularly the men,
because they really wield the
greatest inﬂuence on campus, and
thus, they have the greatest power
to effect positive change if they
choose to do so. It’s up to all of us
to do our part.”

Shaner said. “The music
and noise get over empha-
sized. Give the students
some more time to work
things out.”

Shaneralso said that he
has changed next year’s
leases in an effort to control
noise and trash from par-
ties.

Watkins said the coali-
tion was started to encour-
age and support student
self-governance. Supervi-
sor Carroll Cornstock said
Watkins was doing a good
job, but that real change
would only occur if students
stepped up and took action."

Watkins said she agreed
with Comstock, and that’s
why she has been working
to involve students in the
coalition.

“We went to the Student
Affairs Committee ﬁrst:
the Executive Commit-
tee President, the Chair of
Traveller, the Head Dorm
Counselor, the Chair of
the Student Judicial Coun-
cil, and the Presidents of
the IFC and Panhellenic,”
Watkins said. “We invited
each of those student lead-
ers to participate or send a
designative representative
in their place.”

Other students, Watkins
said, were either recruited
by the student leaders or
volunteered.

The dangers of Black Friday

Injuries, thefts, general chaos on this busy shopping day are the opposite of the Christmas spirit

By Grace Andrews
C 0 L U M N I S T

oday’s topic is Black
Friday.
For those readers
who are not familiar
with Black Friday, let me ex-
plain.

Black Friday is the day after
Thanksgiving, that Friday when
stores have their huge Christ-
mas sales.

It’s the busiest shopping day
of the year by the number of
people out there.

I usually refuse to shop on
Black Friday out of concern for

- my personal well-being.

I am a bit on the shorter side,
and attempting to outrun the
stampedes with the small ap-
pendages that I call legs could
be disastrous. A

However, this year I ended
up shopping on Nov. 24: Black
Friday.

I was just picking up a few
snacks for my road trip back to
school and not participating in
any sort of Christmas shopping.

While ﬁnishing my shopping

list, I saw a friend of mine with
a cart full of items.

She had a DVD player, a lap-
top, a printer/telephone/fax ma-
chine and a digital camera.

All that she was missing was
a life—size robot that could do
housework for her.

The only problem with her
shopping was that it was around
1:30 a.m.

Wal—Mart’s sale did not start
until 5 a.m., but my friend want-
ed to get there early to beat the
mad dash that would happen at
4:58 a.m. when the sales ofﬁ-
cially begun.

The problem with her being
so prompt was that she had to
wait from 1:30 a.m. until 5 a.m.,
when the Black Friday deals
would begin.

I am not going to lie, the
deals were fabulous, but I do
not know if I would have been
willing to wait that long to get
them.

For a second, I considered
getting a few items and wait-
ing around until ﬁve to get the
deals.

Then I realized that I was

wearing ﬂip-ﬂops instead of
sneakers, thus eliminating my

ability to win a footrace to any

of my favorite items.

Also, I had not done Tae—
Bo in months and would not
be able to defend myself from
anyone who wanted to abduct
my items.

When I asked my friend why
she was there four hours early
to buy her items, she informed
me that Wal-Mart had a limited
number of some of the items.
For example there were only
19 laptops on sale, so if she did
not go early, she would not get
any of the items that she had

County residents
should just deal

College students everywhere throw loud parties. So
why are Rockbridge residents surprised we do, too?

By Cralg Malkmes
COLU M NIST

Rockbridge County is really
getting on my nerves.

Not only have I recently re-
ceived a higher punishment for
a speeding ticket on my way out
to the Mill than my roommate re-
ceived when he got a DUI in St.
Louis, but the whole noise ordi-
nance issue is far beyond absurd.

Granted, it didn’t pass on
Monday, but it’s still up in the air.
Things could still change if we, as
students, don’t show any effort to
decrease the noise.

Many neighbors around the
Pole Houses are furious and can’t
believe that the decision has been
simply put off.

They want to push for a new
noise ordinance so strict that, on
Wednesday nights, parties would
have to be shut down before
many students even go out. That’s
ridiculous.

Some neighbors claim that it
is impossible to sleep and that the
bass from our speakers'is unbear-
ably loud long past midnight.

I know for a fact that the music
is turned off at Pole Three when
it’s supposed to be, so that seems
like a pretty unwarranted com-
plaint to me.

Moreover, the neighbors have
the audacity to label students as a
bunch of rich kids whose parents
will pay for any ﬁnes received for
noise violations.

They further complain that
they have to wake up at 7 a.m. or
8a.m. for work, whereas students
can supposedly sleep for the rest
of the day.

Many students who attend
here do come from wealthy back-
grounds.

However, it is obvious that

Technically, we were here ﬁrst,
so in all actuality, the neighbors
shouldn’t be making demands.

their entire lives. In qualifying
for enrollment to this school, one
must surely have a great deal of
responsibility.

Even the existence of an honor
system shows that students un-
derstand and are willing to face
consequences for irresponsible
behavior.

They don’t neglect to observe
the repercussions of misdemean-
ors simply because they assume
that their parents will pay the ﬁne.
They also must attend classes
that can possibly begin at 8 a.m.,
which many times inﬂuences their
decision to drink the night before.

What the neighbors must real-
ize is simply that this is college,
and these things are going to hap-
pen no matter what school you
live near.

Moving into a college town
means constant interaction with
students. Therefore, the lifestyles
of those students are going to have
a big effect on residential areas.

Citizens moving into Lex-
ington should have already con-
sidered this before purchasing a
home near students. If they have
not, Rockbridge County must
have some pretty devious real es-
tate agents.

College students are going to
drink underage. They are going
to throw obnoxious parties. They
are going to do insane things, like
throw kegs on cars, trip into riv-
ers, fall into ﬁres, or even make
visits to Stonewall Jackson.

Deal with it.

Also, how can neighbors com-
plain about ‘noisy Traveller bus-
es’ keeping them up at night?

Without that system, there
would be much more trafﬁc and
parking issues, as well as the dan-
ger of a huge amount of drunk
driving.

Lexington has grown up
around the school, not the other
way around. Without Washington
& Lee, Lexington would not exist
as a town. The ‘Ruins’ we know
of today include a three-story
building that was built in 1793,
which was recognized as the larg-
est building in the entire county at
the time.

Obviously, the business from
students and faculty at the school
gave merchants and craftsmen a
reason to settle nearby and even-
tually form a town.

Technically, we were here
ﬁrst, so in all actuality, the neigh-
bors shouldn’t be coming into this
town and making demands.

Everyone remembers what it
was like to be a college student
— to drink ﬁve nights a week and
stay up until four in the morning
playing beer pong.

I personally only have two and
a half more years.

The seniors this year just ex-
perienced what will prove to be
their last Christmas Weekend.

So just let the students do their
thing, please.

wanted.

She then told me a story of an
incident that occurred last year.

Apparently, her mother had
gone to Wal-Mart at 5 a.m. and
was almost assaulted by a teen-
ager who wanted an electronic
item that was already gone from
the store’s shelves.

The teen even attempted to
reach into my friend’s mother’s
cart and take the item.

After this, my friend and her
mother wisely decided that they
would just go to the stores of-
fensively early and wait until
the sale hours began.

It is because of problems like

this that Wal-Mart had three
on-duty police ofﬁcers that day
to monitor the doors and walk
around the store.

The saddest part about my
shopping trip to Wal-Mart was
that there were other individuals
who had began shopping early
as well.

They all seemed to be wan-
dering aimlessly in the aisles,
trying to squander four hours.

They looked extremely bored
and restless.

What a shame!

It made me sad to see them
spending their day after Thanks-
giving shopping relentlessly,
especially since I was headed
home to eat more Thanksgiv-
ing food, watch football high-
lights with my brother and go
to sleep.

Later that day, when I arose
from my food-induced coma,
I decided to take a look at the
news and see what Black Friday
chaos had ensued.

As usual, there were stories
of people being trampled, toys
being snatched from the unsus-
pecting hands of parents and

people being robbed outside of
department stores and shopping
centers.

Now if that isn’t the Christ-
mas spirit, I don’t know what is!
(Sarcasm intended.)

Seeing those stories put a
damper on my spirit.

Christmas is not about re-
ceiving gifts or accumulating
every item you want.

It is about giving to others
unselﬁshly and brightening up
someone’s day.

As the world around us be-
comes more chaotic with ﬁnals,
last minute shopping and Christ-
mas list writing, I would like
for you to remember that there
is more to life than getting that
great deal on that new high tech
gadget that you want or buying
those stylish new shoes.

It is about spreading joy.

So whether you do that by
donating some items to the
Union Mission, giving to the
Salvation Army or sponsoring
a child in the area through Na-
bors, remember that there are
countless ways to give this sea-
son and throughout the year.

The Democrats’
Worst nightmare

McCain-Giuliani for president in 2008 now very likely

By Abel Delgado
c o LU M NIST

Just a few days after Election
Day 2006, forward-thinking Re-
publicans were celebrating every-
where.

Tliat’s right, after getting a
good old—fashioned whipping,
Republicans were rejoicing.

Why? Because McCain-Giu-
liani is not only the Democrats’
worst nightmare, the pair is now
looking more likely than ever.

Nov, 8 was a deﬁnite wake-up
call for the Grand Old Party.

The Democrats did not really
win this election, but the Republi-
cans most deﬁnitely lost.

The Republicans did not just
lose, they were completely and
utterly dismembered by the vot-
ing public.

Incumbent Republicans
whose names were linked to the
Jack Abramoﬂ‘ scandal probably
would have lost to the likes of
Walter Mondale.

The Democrats did not take
any chances. They had learned
their lesson and realized that ac-
tual Democrats were not going to
win any elections.

So they nominated people like
Jim Webb, a former Republican
whose only claim to donkey alle-
giance is the fact that he opposed
the Iraq war and that there hap-
pened to be a (D) following his
name on the ballot.

There were a lot of moderate
candidates for the Democrats this
time, and the strategy paid off.
Voters got to vote for Republican-
minded candidates without vot-
ing for the disgraced Republican
Party.

In a way, the Democrats were

The Democrats have a whole two
years to remind the American public
why they kept losing elections.

better at being Republicans this
election than the Republicans
were.

So what’s there to be happy
about if you’re an elephant?

Well, just a few days after the
excommunication of the Repub-
lican majority in Congress, two
extremely prominent, respected,
and moderate Republicans ﬁnally
made their 2008 plans official.

Rudolph Giuliani, America’s
mayor, and John McCain, every-
one’s favorite maverick senator,
both have started what we call
presidential exploratory commit-
tees.

They may not be every con-
servative’s favorite duo, but they
are every Republican’s last hope.
We, and I say we both as a moder-
ate Republican and an American,
need McCain and Giuliani.

We need people who do not
decide their stands on issues
based on party affiliation, but on
personal conscience and public
sentiment.

Both these men represent all
that is great with this country, and
the Democrats know this.

Every poll of expected 2008
presidential candidates shows
that there’s really no way either
of them would be defeated by any
Democratic candidate, especially
Hillary “I should be in jail right
now for Whitewater but my hub-

bie was president so now I’m a
senator” Clinton. Yes, her middle
name is much too long for her to
have a chance.

And who else has a shot for
the Democrats? John Edwards
and Wesley Clark could not even
beat John Kerry. That says some-
thing about their chances in a gen-
eral election. And does the aver-
age voter even know what Evan
Bayh, Bill Richardson, or Tom
Vilsack looks like?

What the Democrats also knew
is that before Nov. 8, the chances
of either McCain or Giuliani win-
ning the Republican nomination
were not too great.

There was far too much dis-
tance between them and the base.
But now the base has no choice.

The Republicans are desperate
enough to pick whoever has the
best chance of beating the Demo-
crats, and the Democrats have a
whole two years to remind the
American public why they kept
losing elections before.

If losing in 2006 means Dem-
ocrats show Americans they’re
a bunch of grade-A do-nothings
and McCain or Giuliani gets the
nomination, then maybe Republi-
cans did not really lose.

Maybe this was the best thing
that could have possibly hap-
pened to the party of Lincoln and
Teddy.

Editor makes
a final request

Outgoing editor asks all students to open up

It’s hard to believe, but it
has been a year since I took
over this 110-year-old publi-
cation that “nobody rea .”

In that time, the newsroom
started working the way a real
newsroom does, on new soft-
ware, on new computers.

But the one thing we still
can’t win is you.

I’ve found that it doesn’t
matter what sits between our
pages. Each week, there are

articles covering students
helping charities and perform-
ing on stage.

We raise issues that affect
student life-——like how the
community feels about you,
or how the laws effect your
nightly activities.

And yet we’re still unpopu-
lar. No one wants to be caught
dead reading the Phi in the
Commons.

That is, except the 500-plus
people who tear the issues off
the stands on Monday nights.

Funny, but despite the
claims otherwise, the news-
paper has been around so long
for a reason.

It’s true that the Phi doesn’t

have a perfect track record for
great journalism; for example,
they used to love to reprint an
incoherent article from the
1960’s explaining how the
Phi got its weird name.

(By the way, “Ring-tum
Phi” used to be a phrase in
some tongue-in—cheek foot-
ball cheer dwnk fans used to
yell out back in 1897.)

It’s also true that the Phi
has done some pretty ground-
breaking work to tie the com-
munity together over the
years.

I’ve always been an ideal-
ist, and it shows in the staff
editorials each week. I would
love to think that in a perfect
world, we could set out to
write stories that you all care
about. I’d love to give you
exactly everything you want
and need.

But I’ve found that the
world is, shockingly, not per-
fect.

For starters, you don’t talk
to us.

On the most important sto-
ries, the ones that scream to
be talked about, you all say

IQ/U“/\

Kat Greene, Editor—in-Chief

“no comment.”

In doing this, you are
handing yourself over to the
rumor mill, where, trust me,
you’ll be butchered for it.

I know why you do it: At
least, if it’s just a rumor, no
one could ever know if it’s '
really true.

But if you want us to reach
you, you have to let us in.

I started my tenure as
editor here with a proposal. I
asked you to stick with me,
believe in me, and the news-
paper, and to wait and see
what we could do.

As I end my time here, I
want to ask another favor:
Open up to us. Realize that
we’re not here to hurt you;
we are you.

But we can’t tell the truth
unless you give us your side.
We can’t reach you unless
you reach out, too.

When I came on as editor,
I told you we would try to
make sure good journalism
started coming out of this
publication.

As I leave, I’d like to ask
you to do your part.

Pope’s fightingwords

Benedict is anti-Islamic quote demands action against suicide bombers

By Cody Beauchamp
C 0 LU M N I ST

The most iconic Christian alive
is telling Islam to put its money
where its mouth is.

Thank God/Allah.

First, before I write another
word, let me roll out the disclaim-
er — this article is not an attack on
the religion of Islam. I understand
and acknowledge that, for the
millions who count themselves
as Muslims, Islam is a legitimate
and very real faith. I know that it
at its core is not violent. Do not
take me to be a blatant racist or
soon-to-be crusading evangelical.

That being said:

On Sept. 12 (note the date,
only one day after the 5th an-
niversaiy of the 9/ ll terrorism
attacks), the leader of the Catho-
lic Church, Pope Benedict XVI,
made a comment during a speech
at the University of Regensburg
in Germany that—to put it deli-
cately—did not go over well with
many Muslims.

In his lecture, Benedict quoted
a passage written by Byzantine
Emperor Manuel II Paleologus,
in which Manuel said, “Show me
just what Muhammad brought
that was new and there you will
ﬁnd things only evil and inhuman,
such as his command to spread by
the sword the faith he preached.”

Ouch.

It is obvious that Muslims
would have reason to be insulted
by anyone who read this state-
ment or made this assertion.

The problem is these terrorists don ’t
understand they are not acting in ac-
cordance with their faith.

This brings up an interesting
question—this statement was
used in a lecture by the man most
representative of all Christians in
the world: the Pope.

Why?

Believe me——it is not that the
pontiff did not know what he was
doing. Joseph Ratzinger (as Bene-
dict was known before adopt-
ing his papal name) is one of the
greatest theological heavyweights
alive today and has been for liter-
ally decades.

He served for years in impor-
tant Church policy-setting bodies,
not the least of which was his stint
under John Paul II as Prefect of
the Congregation for the Doctrine
of the Faith. He was one of John
Paul’s most trusted advisors. He
knows his Muslim/Christian poli-
tics well.

Given that, you will be hard-
pressed to convince me he chose
to use that particular passage be-
cause he either could not ﬁnd a
better one or did not realize that
it basically called Islam an evil,
militant religion.

Why then?

Why would the leader of the

largest Christian body all of a
sudden call Islam a violent faith?

Because Benedict is telling the
faithﬁal Muslims and their leaders
to put their money where their
mouth is and prove that their faith
is not anchored in violence.

Think about it—name the one
unifying thread that runs between
the suicide bombers in Pales-
tine, Iraq, Afghanistan, between
the race riots Europe (especially
France) faced last year and be-
tween the terrorists who killed
innocent people in New York,
Washington D.C., Madrid and
London.

You guessed it—they all claim
to have been acting out of reli-
gious fervor and faithﬁilness.
Faithfulness to Islam.

Now, I understand that these
men (and sometimes women) do
not accurately represent the Is-
lamic faith. I understand they are
extremists. So does Benedict. So
do a large majority of Muslims.

The problem is these terrorists
do not understand they are not
acting in accordance with their
faith.

Benedict called out the ele-

phant in the room when he used a
quote that said Islam is by nature
violent. He expected outraged Is-
lamic leaders to rail against the
idea, to claim that Islam is not
violent.

And now that they have, Bene-
dict gets to ask them to prove it.

It is a masterstroke: as the most
visible Christian leader, Benedict
gets to show the Islamic world
how the Catholic Church has con-
demned past violence by Chris-
tians (the Crusades, anyone?) and
declared itself to be a peace-seek-
ing religion.

That is the church’s modus
operandi for the spread and pro-
tection of itself as a religion.

He gets to say that Christians
are using faith to expand, not for
ﬁghting.

At that point, the outraged
imams and clerics will have to
respond. How can they make the
same claim Benedict can without
decrying the acts of the terrorists
and drawing clear separation be-
tween Islam and the terrorists?

They cannot.

John Paul II helped bring
down communism by supporting
the Polish Solidarity movement,
when Poles rejected communism
as a system that failed them.

Benedict XVI could help
bring down terrorism by forcing
Muslims to reject terrorists as not
acting in accordance with true Is-
lamic faith.

Praise Allah. Thank God. You
choose.

Rules in place regulating
the sorority recruitment process
(rush) at Washington and Lee are
designed to protect the women
thinking about joining sororities,
said Panhellenic Recruitment
Chair Kathryn Heaberg.

Heaberg understands that the
list of rules can oﬂen seem con-
fusing, but said these rules serve
the purpose of protecting both the
sororities and the potential new
sisters.

“There are a lot of pressures
that come with adjusting to col-
lege life,” Heaberg said.

“[Panhellenic] understands
that, and we don’t want to add
to those pressures with sorority
rush.”

Heaberg said the sorority re-
cruitment rules put into place by
Panhellenic also seek to promote
better relations between the ﬁve
sororities at W&L.

As an example of how the
rules seek to take the pressure out
of the rush experience for poten-
tial members, Heaberg pointed
towards rules against involving
men in the recruitment process
and consuming alcohol in the
presence of potential members.

There are also rules requiring
that rush dates must be composed
of certain ratios of sisters to po-
tential members.

Heaberg said that rush dates
where potential members are
outnumbered by sisters would be
understandably intimidating ex-
periences for the potential mem-
bers, so Panhellenic has rules that
ensure the dates never have more
sisters than potential recruits.

Heaberg said she believes that
if alcohol were shared by sorority
sisters and potential members, it
would make the potential mem-
bers feel strongly pressured to
drink.

“When you’re looking at one
house, and there are sisters from
that house encouraging you to
drink with them, you would feel
a greater pressure to drink, even
if you didn’t really want to,” Hea-
berg said.

Heaberg also said Panhellenic
has rules during formal recruit-
ment that prevent both potential
members and sisters from drink-
ing. She said the rules are simi-
lar to the requirements that are
in place during the informal rush
events of Fall term.

“Plus,” Heaberg said, “Alco-
hol and drinking shouldn’t really
be the focus of that week,”

When asked why potential
members were forbidden from
being in any of the sorority hous-
es except during special events,
Heaberg pointed to the privileges
that come from being in a soror-
ity.

“It’s deﬁnitely different from

Happy Holidays

 The Best Newspaper that Comes Out on Monday

the fratemities,” Heaberg said
about having closed houses.

“But that’s a privilege that
comes with members to the soror-
ity—getting to go in the house.”

Heaberg said that potential
members are barred from Greek
fratemity-sorority mixers because
membership in a house should
carry some perks and privileges.

“You want to have something
to look forward to,” Heaberg
said.

Heaberg also said that mix-
ers inherently have an element
of men--the fraternity members-
-promoting a sorority above the
others by association.

“We deﬁnitely seek to have a
level playing ﬁeld with all the so-
rorities,” Heaberg said.

She also said it is this desire
to foster and maintain good in-
ter-house relations that also is the
reason behind rules against “dirty
rush” and buying items for poten-
tial members.

“The recruitment process has
the potential to really create bad
feelings between the sororities,”
Heaberg said.

“We want to have rules that
make sure the process creates as
little tension between the sorori-
ties as possible.”

Heaberg reinforced the fact
that once Fall term ends, the for-
mal rush process begins for po-
tential members.

Among the things potential

Rules for formal recruitment week

- potential members are not allowed in the sorority
house with the exception of Greek events and rush

week

- no contact is permitted between active and
potential members during Winter break and rush

week

- drinking is discouraged for potential members

during formal rush week

members can expect to see are
the implementation of no-contact
rules between sisters and potential
members and formal rush week
invitations to come spend time
around sisters in their respective
houses.

“The no contact is there to
take away some of the pressures
surrounding the decision-making
that potential members have to
do,” Heaberg said.

“Sororities will get their allot-
ted time with the evening meet-
ings, but after that it’s a time for
the potential members to work on
their decisions without pressure.”

Heaberg said that potential
members can expect to receive
invitations from all the sorority
houses, after which the potential
members and the sororities both
list their preferences for member-

ship.

After that, a weeklong elimi-
nation process starts for both the
potential members and the sorori-
ties, leading up to the extension
of bids to potential members on
the Friday of formal rush week
around 5 p.m.

After formal bids are distrib-
uted, both the sororities and fra-
ternities welcome their new mem-
bers with tear night celebrations.

Heaberg encourages potential
members with any questions to
talk to their Rho Gammas, who
are sisters who volunteered to
“de-aﬁiliate” from their sorority
for the term in order to provide
impartial advice and guidance to
potential members.

Heaberg said: “Ultimately, we
want to make this entire process
as enjoyable as possible.”

Ballers fall to foes

Generals drop two close decisiqns over the weekend

By Mlke Fahey
sPoRTs EDITOR

After setting a school record
for most points scored in a single
game, the Washington and Lee
women’s basketball team lost two
close games this past weekend
against ODAC opponents.

The Generals got off to a great
start on their season, capturing the
Swarthmore Tip-Off Classic and
an incredible win over Hollins.
Unfortunately, the Generals fell
at the hands of Randolph-Macon
and Virginia Wesleyan.

Sophomore Kara Nadeau said,
“I was really proud of us for win-
ning the tip-off tournament, and
even though our last two games
were losses, 1 think we are gain-
ing good experience for later on
in the season.”

Virginia Wesleyan defeated
the Generals 66-54 in ODAC ac-
tion on Saturday afternoon. The
Generals jumped out to an 11-1
lead just 3:29 into the game, but
the Marlins came right back with
a 10-0 run to even the game at
11-11 with 13:37 left in the ﬁrst
half. The game was a back-and-
forth contest for several minutes
before Virginia Wesleyan closed
the ﬁrst half with an 11-3 run for
a 33-25 lead at the break. W&L
battled back in the second half to
tie the game at 46-46 on a three-
point play by sophomore forward
Kara Nadeau with 8:22 left in the
game. However, after the Marlins
posted an 8-0 run over the next
2:02 the Generals had no answer.

The Generals were led by se-
nior center Jessica Hunsinger,
who notched 16 points and pulled
in eight rebounds. Nadeau added
13 points and seven boards.

into conference play is the best
since the 2002-2003 season, when
the Generals started off 3-1, only
to drop 14 of their next 16 games
en route to an 8-17 season.

Fourth-year Head Coach
Adam Hutchinson notes that the
initial successes are due in part
to the teams base of juniors and
seniors.

“I think a lot of it can be at-
tributed to carry over,” Hutchin-
son said.

On Friday evening, the Gen-
erals recovered from an 11-point
halftime deﬁcit to pull within one
point in the ﬁnal minutes of the
game. They could not pull off a
road win, however, losing 66-64
to Randolph-Macon in an ODAC
battle.

W&L was led by sopho-
more guard Bethany Ridenhour,
who tied a career-high with 16
points and added six assists,
four rebounds and three steals.
Krouchick notched 14 points and
eight boards, and Hunsinger tal-
lied seven points, a game-high 11
rebounds and ﬁve blocks.

Earlier in the week, the Gener-
als set a school record for points
scored and largest margin of vic-
tory with a 90-26 win over Hol-
lins on their home court.

The Generals held Hollins
scoreless for the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes
of play and had a 49-12 lead at the
break. The 64-point victory sur-
passed the forrner record of 55 set
against Mary Baldwin in 1998,
while the 90 points eclipsed the
89 points scored against Emory &
Henry last season.

Ridenhour had 16 points,
while ﬁve Generals were in dou-
ble ﬁgures. Krouchick notched 15
points, while junior guard Wolff
added a career-high 14 markers.
Junior forward Amanda Kane
scored 12 points and Hunsinger
chipped in 11 points, while pull-
ing down eight rebounds. Senior
guard Sarah Otey contributed a
career-high 10 assists.

The W&L women’s basketball
team ‘ ‘claimed-its ‘ﬁrst’ in-sea'son
tournament title since the 1997-
98 season with a 52-45 win over
Swarthmore in the championship
game of the Swarthmore Tip-Off

Tournament. -

Krouchick scored 18 points
in the championship game and
notched six rebounds en route to
being named tournament MVP.
She was joined on the all-touma-
ment team by Ridenhour.

The Generals had opened their
2006-07 campaign with a 62-24
victory over the City College of
New York.

Despite the recent losses, the
team is rebounding well. As soph-
omore Bethany Ridenhour said,
“We are learning quickly and re-
alizing that we can be a dominant
team in the ODACs this year and
perhaps even win the league. “

The Generals have put in long

hours on the court in the pre- ‘

season, preparing for a run at the
ODAC championship. It is this
drive and determination that have
contributed to the team’s great
start.

Nadeau said, “I think we all
worked really hard in the off-sea-
son and have been practicing hard
every practice.”

Backed by a strong group of
returning stars, the Generals al-
ready have a proven court chem-
istry that will be very beneﬁcial to
them as the season draws on.

“We are probably the hardest
working team in the conference
and we are looking to prove it,”
Ridenhour said. “Everyone on
the team has improved their game
and stepped it up so that our team
is as deep as can be.”

As the team continue its quest
for an ODAC title, Nadeau would
like to see the student body come
out and support the team. “I am
expecting all of my friends to
come to the games and cheer and
hold up signs,” she said.

drops the ball

“In the past, we had to rely a
lot on freshmen for a good num-
ber of minutes, and that’s not the
case this year.”

On Saturday the men faced off
with Randolph-Macon, a team the
Generals have not beaten since
1977. Though Bienemann, with
some help from F emi Kusimo
kept the Generals close, Ran-
dolph-Macon pulled away in the
ﬁnal minutes for a 63-58 victory.

Virginia Wesleyan trounced

the Generals 74-50, outrebound-
ing W&L by a 43-17 margin.

“We know we can play with
these teams,” said Hutchinson,
citing close losses last year to
Randolph-Macon and other top
conference foes.

Added freshman forward John
Twomey, “The next three games
(against Randolph-Macon, Va.
Wesleyan, and Eastern Menno-
nite) will really show us how far
we’ve come as a team.”

 Generals fall to Wilkes

W&L suffers tough 42-0 loss in
ﬁrst round of the NCAA tourney

By Brlan Devlne
smrr warren

Washington and Lee Generals
football had its best season in 25
years this fall, winning the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
outright and reaching the post-
season for the first time since
1951.

Their success in the regular
season did not carry over to the
playoffs, however, as the Gener-
als fell by a score of 42-0 to the
Wilkes University Colonels in
Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

The Colonels held every ad-
vantage on paper coming into the
game and they proved themselves
worthy of their top seed in the
East Region.

Led by a swarming defense
that forced three W&L turnovers,
the Colonels jumped to a 21-point
ﬁrst quarter lead and never looked
back. Four of Wilkes’ ﬁrst ﬁve
drives ended in touchdowns.

The Generals were hurt by the
early turnovers.

On the game’s third play,
W&L freshman quarterback R.J.
Vamer was intercepted by Bryan

. throw f<_>r..a. tczuchdoy/.n,..v. ... ». .r

The Generals’ second drive
faired no better, as sophomore
tailback Stuart Sitterson fumbled
a pass reception on his own 30-
yard line that was recovered by

the Colonels’ John Darrah, giv-
ing the home side excellent ﬁeld
position.

Capitalizing on the Gener-
als’ second mistake of the quar-
ter, Wilkes tailback Jason Nabba
scored to make it 14-0 with only
ﬁve minutes gone off the clock.

Even without the visitors’ mis-
takes, the undefeated Wilkes of-
fense easily outgunned its W&L
counterpart.

Led by quarterback Al Karaffa
and tailback Tom Andreopolous,
the Colonels amassed 387 yards
to the Generals’ 141.

The Generals frequently failed
to convert on third down. Doug
Sweeney punted eight times and
Ben Long missed two ﬁeld goals.

The Generals’ defense, so ef-
fective against regular season
ODAC competition, could not
contain Andreopolous and the
Wilkes offense.

Rotating three running backs
throughout the game, Wilkes
wore down the W&L defense.

Andreopolous, the team’s
usual starter, had 169 yards on 15
carries. Freshman fullback Drew
Letcavage added 55 yards on 16
canies, and short-yardage _ spe-
cialist_l}Iabha..chalked.up ;40 yards
and two touchdowns.

The mistake-ﬁlled game was
a disappointing end to the best
football season in W&L’s recent
history.

Patiently waiting
for the big honors

Jeter and Manning continue to seek important hardware
despite receiving recognition in other ways for their careers

By Adam Lewls
COLUMNIST

Dan Marino, Karl Malone,‘

Tony Gwynn.

Hearing these three names
mentioned in the same sentence
can imply only one thing: great
players who retired without win-
ning a champi-
onship.

These ath-
lete's compiled
some of the
best statisti-
cal careers in
recent history.
Yet when sports
fans and ana-
lysts discuss the greatest players
of all time in football, basketball,
and baseball, they oﬁen leave
these names out for the sole rea-
son that their hands lack jewelry.

Having held the same discus-
sion on numerous occasions, I
understand the logic. At the end
of the day (or season for that mat-
ter), only one thing matters--the

 

championship, not the regular

season stats. . .

But let me reverse that argu-
ment, coming to the defense of
players like Peyton Manning and
Alex Rodriguez, who could very
well join the likes of the previ-
ously mentioned athletes.

This past week, the Minne-
sota Twins’ Justin Momeau was

awarded American League’s

M.V.P., to the dismay of Derek

Jeter, who was a close second.
Over the past decade, Jeter has

- been regarded as one of the most

elite athletes in the four major
sports, and undoubtedly one of
the best postseason players in his-
tory, (in baseball terms, he is of-

ten thought of as “clutch”).

As a ﬁfth year player in 2000,
he already boasted four rings, ty-
ing him with the great Lisa Marie
Presley.

But equally as notable is the

[fact that he still remains lacking

an M.V.P. award, and that is the
foundation of my argument.

I am in no way downplaying

his tremendous postseason hero-
ics and statistics. But to me, it is
only fair to attribute the champi-
onships he won to the rest of his
team as well, which goes without
saying, as they are indeed the
Yankees.
’ ‘ The same goes for players like
Tom Brady. He may have won
three Super Bowls, but his stats
are far inferior to Peyton Man-
ning. Until Manning gets his ring,
Brady will be regarded by most as
a better quarterback.

If you look at the teams of
Jeter and Brady, certain things be-
come clear.

Jeter’s Yankees, under the
ownership of George Stein-
brenner, spent by far the most

money in baseball since the be-
ginning of their dynasty in 1996,
so obviously Jeter had plenty of
help.

In contrast, someone like Alex
Rodriguez has won two M.V.P.
awards, yet will continued to be
criticized until hevwins a champi-
onship. ,

Not to undermine the postsea-
son performances of Tom Brady,
but in each of his three Super
Bowl seasons, he was equipped
with one of the league’s best de-
fenses. The defensive unit played
more than a little role in the Patri-
ots’ dominance.

Manning, on the other hand,
simply put up record-setting num-
bers during the regular season;
however, he was not fortunate
enough to have such a powerful
defense.

But my object is not to defend
Manning, nor is it to downplay
J eter and Brady.

Rather, I want to point out that
championships in no way deﬁne a
player’s ability, and furthermore,
they carry way too much weight
in the argument of the “bests” in
the various sports.

Just because a player is not sur-
rounded by championship,-worthy
talent should not immediately re-
move him from the argument,
and in my mind, as well as that of
“Borat,” his career should still be
considered a “great success!”

Junior comerback Mark Snod-
dy, who set a new school record
with 17 career interceptions in
only three years, was named one
of two ﬁnalists for the small-col-
lege Dudley Award, given to the
outstanding Division II or III
football player in Virginia.

Vamer was named ODAC
rookie of the year and ﬁnished the

season with over 1000 yards pass-
ing, despite only playing eight
games.

The Touchdown Club of Rich-
mond named Bryant Fulk its Vir-
ginia Division II-III defensive
lineman of the year.

Last in this impressive spree
of accomplishments, do-every-
thing senior Colton Ward ends his

career as the University’s all-time
leader in pass receptions with 161,
as well as second in kickoff return
yards with 1586 and tird all-time
in all-purpose yards with 3740.

‘Next season, the”Genera1s will
return Vamer and Sitterson as the
core of their offense and should
be expected to ﬁnish at least sec-
ond in the conference.

Generals lose in Elite 8 after knocking oﬂ top seed

By Mike Huntress
STAFF warren

Washington and Lee’s wom-
en’s soccer team got knocked
out of the NCAA Division III
quarterﬁnals Nov. 19 in a fash-
ion emblematic of how they’ve
played all season.

They recorded a shutout.

It took penalty kicks to de-
cide a winner, with both teams
playing stalwart defense.

Ranked 24th nationally, the
Generals loss came at the hands
of 19th ranked Virginia Wes-
leyan.

Goalkeeper Kiki Moreo was
solid as usual, turning back
several scoring opportunities
in a game where it was clear a
single goal would be the decid-
ing factor.

Sophomore forward Anne
Van Devender nearly put one
away for the Generals on a one
time shot from ten yards out,
but her attempt sailed harm-
lessly over the bar. Penalties
went 4-3, Virginia Wesleyan’s
way to send the Generals’ home
packing.

The Generals troubles with
Virginia Wesleyan were well-
documented this season, as the
two teams had gone up against
one another twice already.

Back on Sept. 23, Wesleyan
snapped the Generals ﬁve-game
winning streak to start the sea-
son. That game ended in a 0-0
draw after two overtimes.

On Nov. 1 the Generals

yielded their second goal of the
season to Wesleyan and lost 1-0,
knocking them out of the ODAC
tournament.

Wesleyan dominated early,
and after their goal the two team’s
settled into a virtual stalemate.

It seemed ﬁtting, although
frustrating, that the only team
who had previously been able to
beat the Generals should reappear
in the NCAA tournament to send
them home packing.

The penalty-kick ending
capped off what was a remarkable
season for the Generals. Includ-
ing their NCAA performance,
they were 19-1-3, setting a school
record for victories and setting a
new program record for allowing
only three goals the entire season,
after starting the season with ﬁf-
teen straight shutouts.

The Generals, despite losing
in the ODAC tournament, had the
best regular season record and en-
tered that ODAC tournament with
the top seed.

The Generals had an amaz-
ing run in the NCAA tournament,
knocking off top-seed Washing-
ton University in St. Louis in the
Sweet 16 of the tournament, 2-1.
The Generals were led by goals
from junior Martha Caulkins
and sophomore Erica Giordano.
Caulkins was a force for the Gen-
erals offense, and Moreo contin-
ued her stellar season in goal for
W&L.

On an individual level it was
also a special season. Head Coach
Neil Cunningham was named

ODAC Coach of the Year, and the
Generals had nine players recog-
nized by on the All-ODAC team.

Sophomore sensation Van De-
vender, senior captain Maggie
Megear, and junior captain Haley
Bunting were named as ﬁrst-team
All-ODAC players.

Freshman Maggie Sutherland,
seniors Anne Wiltshire and Jamie
Dorsey, and sophomores Marisa
Van Brunt and Moreo received
All-ODAC Second Team honors.
Freshman Roz Klann received an
Honorable Mention.

Four players were also recog-
nized by the All-South Region
team. Van Devender was named
to the First Team, while Wilshire,
Megear, and Moreo were all
named to the second team. Three
Generals were recognized by the
Academic All-District team. Ju-
nior Martha Caulkins was given
First Team accolades, while soph-
omore Kate Corr and Van Dev-
ender were selected to be on the
Second Team.

Of the nine players recognized
by the All-ODAC team, six of
them return for what should be a
very formidable team next year.

With eight total seniors leav-
ing after this year, there will be
gaps to ﬁll, but much of that will
be made up by the increased ma-
turity of this years’ strong sopho-
more and freshman classes.

The Generals ended the season
ranked tenth overall in a national
poll, and set a school record for
the best showing by the team in
the NCAA tournament.

Just four games into the season,
the Washington and Lee men’s

Off to their fastest start since
2002, the Generals had taken ad-
vantage of a veteran roster and
have won three out of their ﬁrst
four non-conference games, in-
cluding a run to the ﬁnal round of
the W&L Men’s Basketball Tip-
off Tournament here in Lexing-
ton. It remains to be seen if the
momentum of the early season
can carry over into conference
play.

After falling to Division I VMI
in an exhibition opener, W&L
hosted three other schools in the
W&L Men’s Basketball Tip-off,
Tournament. The Generals drew
Denison in the ﬁrst round, and,
aided by a 21-5 run in the second
half, dispatched the Big Red by a
score of 82-71.

Senior guard Chris Halkitis
led W&L with 15 points, in a

game where 10 different Generals '

scored.

W&L then moved onto the
ﬁnals to face Averett College.
Averett relied on near-perfect
shooting and led by 23-point at
halftime.

The Cougars went 15-17 from
inside the three-point arc in the
ﬁrst half and didn’t miss a shot
from inside the arc until one min-
ute before halftime.

Despite 16 points from sopho- .

more guard Isaiah Goodman, the
Generals could not close this half-
time deﬁcit, and took their ﬁrst
loss of the season by a score of 79-
56. Goodman and junior forward
Greg Bienemann were named to
the all-toumament team.

After the disappointing ﬁnish
to their home tournament, W&L
looked to rebound on the road
against Dickinson College. Tak-

Sweet sets two school records and qualiﬁes for NCAA championships

The men’s and women’s swim-
ming teams continue the season
with strong ﬁnishes, school re-
cords and individual cuts to qual-
ify for the NCAA meet.

The women’s swimming team
ﬁnished fourth out of 11 teams at
the Franklin & Marshall Invita-
tional on Sunday Dec. 3.

One technique that the team
has used to achieve a strong re-
cord is specialized practices.

“We have training speciﬁcally
with what you compete in,” said
freshman Jenna Worsham. “For
example, I swim IM, so practices
are designed speciﬁcally for that
race, targeting what you need.”

Also, the team has been very
focused on nutrition this year.

“Our coach handed out pam-
phlets on nutrition,” said fresh-
man Annaria Nardone.

“We have to learn how to keep
hydrated, eat a lot of protein, and
when to eat throughout the day,”

she said.

The teams will also be going
on a training trip to Florida after
Christmas, where they will be
coached by Olympic swimmers
and have meets twice a day.

“For the training trip, we have
a few Olympians come coach us
and help us with our technique,”
said Worsham. “We come back
in really good shape with a lot of
momentum to send us through the
rest of the season.”

The Washington and Lee men’s
swimming team ﬁnished fourth at
the NIKE Open, hosted by Ken-
yon College on Dec. 2. The men
broke three school records and
made ﬁve NCAA cuts.

One reason for the men’s
strong ﬁnishes is improvement
with their breaststroke and butter-
ﬂy swimmers.

“We are zoned in on every
race and really getting some good
experience early in the season,”
said Alex Sweet, who set a new
school record in the 100 freestyle.
“Additionally, our breaststrokers

and ﬂyers are really stepping up
this year, and it looks as if we are
going to have a great year in that
department.”

Sweet was the feel-good story
of the weekend. Aﬁer his house
burned down on Wednesday
monring, Sweet rose to the occa-
sion and qualiﬁed for the NCAA
national championships.

With 10 freshmen, the seniors
have made an effort to take new
members under their wing and
to take full advantage of a large
team.

“We have a huge freshmen

 cut)

class, but also have a much big-
ger senior class than last year,”
said Sweet. “We have the expe-
rienced swimmers who can help
the freshmen make the necessary
adjustments. This will become in-
creasingly more important as con-
ference and nationals approach.”

The goal of the women’s team
is to win ODACS.

“We are hoping for another win
at the ODACS,” said Worsham.
“And we want to beat our biggest
rival--Randolph Macon Woman’s
College. We can deﬁnitely do it,
but it’s going to take a lot of train-
ing and competitiveness.”
