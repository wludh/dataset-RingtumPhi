EDlTOR—|N-CHIEF

The Rockbridge County Board of
Supervisors have put off voting on a

’ proposed noise ordinance—for now.

The proposal, which includes pro-
visions for a permitting system and
litter pickup, was set aside at the su-
pervisor’s meeting Monday, Sept. 25.

The debate over the ordinance
stems from a dispute between the
students living in the Pole Houses
on Furrs Mill Road and Windfall on
Greenhouse Road.

Several neighbors at the meeting
complained openly about the noise
from student parties, saying that it has
disrupted their lives.

“It’s not that big a deal~until you
have to live with it,” said Cindy Wise-
man, a Hunter Hill resident.

She said that students yelling, loud
music, and even the noise from the
Traveller buses all make her nights
miserable.

Wiseman said that neighbors have
to deal with noise from student parties
late into the night, which is especially
hard because she has to wake up early

for work. .

Some have even resorted to taking
out hotel rooms for the night to hide
from the noise, Wiseman said.

The neighbors say they want the

ordinance to help protect them from"

the students’ partying.

“If we have the ordinance in place,
at least we would have something we
could work with and use," Wiseman
said.

Sheritf Bob Day, who spoke at the
meeting, said he wanted the board to
hold off on their vote until the three
county noise ordinance charges for the
month of September went to court.

All three charges were against
Washington and Lee students. Two of
them, John Parker and Matthew Leis-
man, pleaded guilty to the charges on
Wednesday, Sept. 27. 1

Both men were ticketed at the
same house, but on different consecu-
tive nights.

Sgt. Hugh Ferguson said both men
were polite and understanding about
the situation.

They will each have to pay court
costs and were ﬁned $50.

But both men now have misde-

meanor chznges on their records. . .

Senior David Olchowski was also
charged with violating the noise ordi-
nance earlier this month.

He pleaded no contest, he said,
because he had tried to stop the party
when the ofﬁcer warned him.

If his house has no more problems
until Dec. 19. the violation will be
dropped from his record.

Neighbors say that isn’t enough.

“That’s all the judge is going to
dofslap them on the hand," Wise-
man said.

The university has made some
strides to try and close the gap between
the students and the community.

Dawn Watkins, dean of students,
and Jane Horton, director of student
health, launched the Campus-Com-
munity Coalition last year.

The coalition was started to help
students and their neighbors come to
understand each other, said Watkins.

“The problem was that no one was
talking to each other,” she said.

Watkins and Horton recruited
neighbors with ﬂyers, and the coali-

Freshmen get a bit
gooﬁz to win votes

By Wesley 0’DeIl
STAFF WRITER

ashington and Lee’s
campus has been a bit
more colorful despite

the construction work for the past
few weeks, as signs bearing slo-
gans like “Pick Corn” and “James
Dick: He’s got BIG plans” have
appeared on pretty much any sur-
face to which tape will adhere.

The ground itself has even be-
come an advertising medium for a
certain “Kiwi.”

Freshman elections never fail
to entertain.

The class of 2010 voted last
week to select their class presi-
dent and their representatives to
the EC‘and SJC. Elections held
Monday pitted no fewer than 25
candidates against each other in
elections for three diﬂerent posts.
The large number of candidates
forced two runoff elections which
were held on Wednesday and Fri-
day. Voting Regulations Board
Co-Chair Kathleen Morphis said
the ﬁerce competition and high
voter tumout — in the 70%-range
— “indicates the eagerness of [the
class of 20 10] to become an active
part of the W&L community.”

The ﬁnal tally of the votes was
not available as of press time.

While the run-offs may be
typical of freshmen elections,
this year’s contest was atypical
in the campaigning methods the
candidates employed. In addition
to the customary posters and not-
so-customary chalk, several EC
candidates participated in a forum
with their potential constituents
in the BDG quad on the Saturday
before the elections.

For over an hour, candidates
Abel Delgado, Daniel Haycraﬁ,
Elizabeth Micci, Elliot O’Brien,
and James Dick gave prepared
opening and closing remarks and
also took questions from an audi-
ence numbering over 30 students.

  Schools prepare for comingflu

Health experts and administrators at W&L and VMI are preparing for a possible bird ﬂu pandemic

 

By Dane Davls
STAFF WRITER

As health officials and com-
munity leaders around the country
prepare for a possible pandemic
ﬂu outbreak, Washington and Lee
is getting ready, too.

W&L’s Ofﬁce of the Provost
and the Deans Academic Speak-
ers Program at the Virginia Mili-
tary Institute are hosting an open
discussion on ramiﬁcations of an
inﬂuenza pandemic.

Pandemic ﬂu can be devastat-
ing. The last great pandemic, the
Spanish Flu outbreak of 1918,
lasted for only 18 months but
caused the deaths of at least 50
million people. The inﬂuenza pan-
demics of 1957 and 1968 killed
2.7 million people. The worry of
a ﬂu pandemic is so great that the
U.S. Congress has appropriated
2.3 billion dollars for pandemic

readiness.

The attention now being paid
to the possibility of ﬂu pandem-
ic is largely due to the rise of
the inﬂuenza virus H5N1, more
commonly known as “bird ﬂu.”
The H5N1 strain is a new inﬂu-
enza subtype, ﬁrst causing human
deaths in Hong Kong, China in
1997.

This new strain has caused
over 200 human deaths. Current-
ly, it can only be contracted if a
person closely handles a bird car-
rying the virus.

The greatest concern is that
the virus may mutate into a high-
ly transmissible human form, in-
stigating another inﬂuenza pan-
demic. Estimates from the United
Nations place possible death tolls
for a H5N1 outbreak between 5
and 150 million people.

All of the information concern-
ing an inﬂuenza pandemic begs

the question ~ is W&L ready?
Jane Horton, director of the Stu-
dent Health Center. says the uni-
versity is not fully prepared. She
also said schools and institutions
around the country are also still in
the planning stages

Since pandemic ﬂu only re-
cently became a pressing issue,
authorities made few major prep-
arations. The possibility of an
outbreak has prompted authori-
ties to begin preparations for an
outbreak.

In conjunction with VMI and
local health authorities, W&L has
begun to develop a plan of prepa-
ration and action to deal with an
inﬂuenza pandemic.

The plan, still in draft form,
takes a multi-level approach to
dealing with an outbreak. Differ-
ent degrees of pandemic severity
would yield different responses
from the university. For example,

if the pandemic strain were dis-
covered in the region, the univer-
sity would begin stockpiling food,
supplies, and vaccinations.

Details concerning how much
should be stockpiled and when
to act have yet to be answered.
Decisions on stockpiling are
expensive, considering the im-
mense cost of vaccinations and
other goods. Dr. David Copeland,
VMI’s physician, states: “We of-
fer ﬂu shot every year and that
costs about $10 per shot. Prepar-
ing for a devastating pandemic ﬂu
is another matter. If we follow
all the federal guidelines, it could
cost tens of thousands of dollars
to prepare for it.”

The open forum is titled “Pan-
demic Inﬂuenza: Ethics, Law,
and the Public’s Health” Guest
speaker Lawrence 0. Gostin, JD,
LLD will discusses how to make
difﬁcult ethical choices when

posed with the scenario of a ﬂu
pandemic. Questions concerning
who receives vaccinations, how
quarantine should be handled,
how much aid can be expected
from state and federal govem-
ment, and l1ow to avoid facility
overload.

Ultimately inﬂuenza pandemic
preparation is an individual effort.
Dr. Horton stresses the need for
awareness, communication, and
education. Basic practices, such
as washing one’s hands, can go a
long way to stopping the spread
of the virus. If a pandemic does
occur, following guidelines and
cooperating with medical authori-
ties will improve the situation for
everyone.

A ﬂu pandemic in the next
generation is considered almost
inevitable. Dr. Horton and Dr. Co-
peland are vigorously preparing
their schools for that eventuality.

arly decision stays for now

Harvard is dropping its early admissions program, but W&L and schools may not follow their lead

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

Harvard University is hop-
ing to see early admissions pro-
grams disappear from the world
of college admissions.

In a bold move that grabbed
the attention of institutions na-
tionwide, the Ivy-league icon
announced Sept. 12 that it would
be doing away with its own Ear-
ly Action program starting for
applicants to the class of 2012.

“The college admissions pro-
cess has become too pressured,
too complex, and too vulnerable
to public cynicism,” said Har-
vard’s interim President Derek
Bok in a statement released on
Harvard’s website.

Bok cited speciﬁc concerns
that programs such as Early
Action (“EA”) and the binding
Early Decision (“ED”) tend to
“advantage the advantaged,”
a reference to one of the most
common criticisms of EA / ED
programs.

The “advantages the advan-
taged” concept argues that EA
and ED programs put students
from poor and rural back-
grounds at a disadvantage when
compared against typically
wealthier students attending re-
source and counseling—rich elite
high schools.

The crux of the argument is
that these “disadvantaged” stu-
dents do not have the necessary
coaching to get in to colleges
during the EA / ED acceptance
cycles, when many colleges
will ﬁll a large portion the slots
available in their incoming
class. More privileged students
often have better access to sup-
port and coaching.

Bok also pointed out that
binding ED programs eliminate
the ability for poorer students to
compare ﬁnancial aid packages
between various institutions,
which potentially forces com-
mitted students to go with less
aid.

Harvard’s decision launched
a wave of debate on the nature
of admissions practices for top
colleges.

The debate only intensiﬁed
following Princeton University
and the University of Virginia’s
recent decisions to follow Har-
vard’s lead and do away with
their programs last Monday.

However, many College Ad-
missions Directors are urging
caution.

Vanderbilt Dean of Admis-
sions Dr. Douglas L. Christian-
sen said, “If Harvard, Princeton
and UVA can switch, I applaud
them for that.”

But, said Christiansen, “what

There are, needless to say, a lot of traditions

here that we hold very dear, and its very nice

to have nucleus of students in every class who

understand and cherish those traditions.
JACOB SPENCER, W&L admlsslons counselor

 

we’re all trying to look at is how
do we ensure that all students
have accessibility to the most
competitive institutions in the
US?

“We need to ensure that
people from high schools where
college counseling isn’t strong
don’t get hurt in the process of
applying because of early ad-
missions programs.”

Washington and Lee Admis-
sions Counselor ‘Jacob Spen-
cer said he thinks “that other
schools are going to have to take
a look at their Early Admissions
programs and see if they work
in their particular situations.

“I don’t think other schools
are simply going to look at Har-
vard and hop on some band-
wagon.”

Spencer said that he didn’t
believe early admissions pro-
grams were likely to be dropped

oise ordinance
changes tabled

The proposed
noise ordinance:

- bans noise disturbances
between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.
Sunday through Thursday and
between 12 a.m. and 7 a.m.
on Friday and Saturday.

- requires a $10 permit,
which lists the location, time,
number of guests, parking,
and the person responsible.

- includes a provision
requiring litter be picked up
by 9 a.m. the following day.

- deﬁnes a gathering of 30
or more people not entirely
enclosed indoors a “large
party public nuisance." It
used to be 15 people, but
the rule was changed so that
some county family functions
would be excluded.

- denies a permit to any
location that has violated the
noise ordinance more than
three times.

- sets the punishment for

a ﬁrst offense as a Class 3
Misdemeanor. The second
offense is a Class 2, and

the third is a Class 1—which
could lead to up to a year in V
jail.

tion eventually included
membership from sheriff’s
deputies and student leaders.

Watkins said students living
in problem areas were disinter-
ested in the project, but several
students on Windfall Hill said
they had never heard of it.

Watkins said that the uni-
versity started the project in
response to pressure from the
community, but that the school
could not control off-campus
life.

“We’re not saying, ‘Don’t
have a party,’” she said. “We
just want to have them put
some guidelines in place.”

Watkins and Horton wrote a
letter to the supervisors in June
suggesting several changes to
the current noise ordinance—
many of which were included
in Monday’s proposal.

In their letter, they said,
“Complaints by private citizens
that do not result in formal cita-
tions are nearly impossible for
the university to handle effec-
tively.”

They pointed out that a per-
mit system would allow the
university to handle the com-
plaints through the Student Ju-
dicial Board.

“This has been an incred-
ible lesson in local gov-
ernment,” Watkins said.
But, she said the university is
trying not to get involved.

“There’s this perception
that the university is cracking
down,” she said. “We’re just
trying to mediate.”

The coalition has not yet
met this, year, because partici-
 and

At the meeting Monday,
Harvey Hotinger said that the
work the university was do-

ing “didn’t amount to a hill of
beans.” ‘

Hotinger is the representa-
tive from Kerr’s Creek, the dis-
trict where both the Pole Houses
and Windfall Hill are located.

Sheriff Day said that if the
ordinance passes, his office is
going to be tougher on student
parties.

“We’re going to be doing a
lot more enforcing,” he said.

He said that he and his depu-
ties are responding to the grow-
ing pressure from the commu-
nity.

His ofﬁce has seen a lot
more complaints from citizens,
he said.

Day said that the decision on
the noise ordinance is up to the
students.

If students would be good
neighbors and obey the law, the
problems would go away, he
said.

Olchowski, who lives on
Windfall Hill, said he wants his
neighbors to approach him be-
fore calling the sheriff to com-
plain.

“We’re doing everything
we can to keep the parties low-
key,” he said.

Some neighbors said that
they feel the students can work
the problems out themselves.

Glenn Sager and Ed Bauer,
who both live in houses near
Windfall, said they did not want
to see laws passed exclusively
against students.

“The last thing we want is
more laws,” Bauer said.

Sager said that if the stu-
dents got together and tried to
understand their neighbors, the
tension between the community
and the students would lessen.

“I think there are enough
sensitive young people out
there,” he said.

“I have faith in them.”

at W&L anytime soon.

W&L has the binding Early
Decision program only.

“There are, needless to say,
a lot of traditions here that we
hold very dear, and it’s very nice
to have nucleus of students in
every class who understand and
cherish those traditions,” said
Spencer. “Early decision gives
us that core because it shows
us the students who genuinely
want to be here and want to be a
part of keeping those traditions
alive.”

W&L is not alone in this

regard; interviews with admis-.

sions offers from schools na-

tionwide all reﬂected a common

attitude of “wait and see.”
Some institutions are uncom-

‘ fortable with the philosophy of

Harvard’s decision.
Dave Wottle, Dean of Ad-
missions at Rhodes College,

said “Every school has the right
to make a statement by their
actions  to say, through their
actions, that they have philo-
sophical problems with early
programs because they place
some applicants at a disadvan-
tage in the admission process.”

But, continued Wottle, “that
doesn’t mean that all other
schools share that same belief
and that they must, or should, or
will follow suit.”

Wottle also had difﬁculty
understanding one rationale be-
hind Harvard’s decision.

“I would question whether a
school with an acceptance rate
of only about 10% can signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the stress associ-
ated with the selection process
by simply eliminating its early
admissions program,” said Wot-
tle.

Still, Harvard’s actions — and
Princeton and UVA’s response
— have set admissions ofﬁces
across the nation to work on
evaluating their early admis-
sions programs, W&L included.

“I know that Dean Hartog,
Provost Williams and Presi-
dent Ruscio will be meeting
in the coming year to consider
the state of Early Decision at
W&L,” said Spencer.

“I’m sure they will consider
input from the Board of Trust-

ees and others.”

Still, many admissions offi-
cers doubt that, despite the fresh
scrutiny, early admissions pro-
grams will suddenly be elimi-
nated.

Said Spencer, “Harvard is in
a very different position from
other schools in the country in
regard to admissions.”

“What’s right for Harvard
may not be right for everyone
else,” said Wottle.

“The popular press has a
tendency to ﬁxate on the hand-
ful of ‘Ivy League’ schools and
think that what they do can or
should be transposed onto the
Vast majority of other selective
institutions, and that’s just not
the case. [But] what works for
the Harvards and the Princetons
and the UVAs may not be what
is best for every institution, or
for their students.”

“Can there be abuses?”
Vanderbilt’s Dean Christiansen
said.

“Of course. But what’s im-
portant is that each institution
look at the programs they have
in place and ask themselves
what can be done to ensure that
any student who is qualiﬁed,
who does want the education
the institution provides, gets it
regardless of background.”

Candy for Votes
at election time

continued from page 1
Freshman Zaq Lawal
moderated.

Candidates discussed a
wide variety of topics, from
codiﬁcation of Honor Viola-
tions to complaints about EC
secrecy. The candidates advo-
cated for some serious depar-
tures from standard practice,
including candidate Elliot
“Kiwi” O’Brien’s call for a
transparent budget process
in the distribution of ﬁmds to
student organizations. All the
candidates agreed that forms
of sexual assault should be
considered an honor viola-
tion.

Upperclassmen present
were impressed with the de-
bate for this often issueless
race, which was organized
and sponsored by the can-
didates themselves through
campus notices and Facebook
messages.

“I have not seen anything
like this before. [This is] the
most dialogue [in a student
election] in four years,” said
Head Dorm Counselor Sam
Wilmoth, who commended
the candidates “for being can-
didates instead of just making
posters.”

The forum highlighted an
unusual facet of student elec-
tions: issues. Said “Kiwi”
O’Brien of the audience at
the forum, “their questions
were insightful and really
challenged the candidates
to explain their positions 
at the beginning of the elec-

Its hard to claim, ‘I am going to do this or
that if elected, ’ because almost everything

tion process I think there was a
feeling that there weren’t any
issues. Now I’m impressed by
the number of freshman talking
about them.”

O’Brien’s calls for change
in the EC budget process and
in how the University handles
sexual assault have sparked
controversy.

Said O’Brien’s opponent in
Friday’s runoff, John Twomey,
“the uniqueness of the Execu-
tive Committee position hin-
ders what would commonly be
referred to as a platform...it’s
hard to claim, ‘I am going to do
this or that if elected,’ because
almost everything is reviewed
on a case—by-case basis.”

Of course, debates aren’t the
only way of winning votes; SJC
candidate James Wolff was spot-
ted making his rounds around
the freshmen dorms Thursday
night handing out handshakes in
addition to candy from a large
bucket.

For many freshmen, the
game is still all about name
recognition. Freshman Kelsey
Walsh, who attended the Satur-
day forum, said people for the
most part still “vote for who
they know.”

Twomey is betting his
campaign on just that.
“Talking to people at the
d-hall, in—between class, or
just walking around cam-
pus makes it possible for
me to actually convince
people I am the right can-
didate,” he said.

Regardless of which
strategy brings victory, the
candidates have been uni-
form in their praise of their
supporters and the class as
a whole.

Said O’Brien, “[those
who have] discussed ideas
and issues with me, worn
my shirts, taken up chalk
and attended debates and
speeches are the ones who
have made this election
process so productive and
fun.”

The Voting Regulation
Board’s Morphis concurs,
saying “the candidates
have deﬁnitely worked
hard to get their names
out there, and I think it has
been a good experience for
the class to come together
and think about what they
would like to see happen
for the year.”

Hating Hugo

Tired of listening to Hugo Chavez? Use less 01'].

By Dylan Merrlll
co LUM msr

For the past couple of weeks,
the national media has been ra-
bidly reporting on the vituperative
remarks that Hugo Chavez deliv-
ered to the U.N. General Assem-
bly on Sept. 20. The Venezuelan
president fervently waved a Noam
Chomsky book as he commented
on President Bush’s recent pres-
ence at the same rostrum.

“Yesterday, the devil came
here,” noted the avid critic of the
Bush administration, adding that
the podium “smells of sulfur.”
Chavez then made the sign of the
cross and prayed silently to him-
self, making sure that all of the at-
tendees were aware of his piety. I
guess the two presidents do have
some things in common...

Needless to say, media up-
roar ensued. Many journalists
pounced at the prospect of report-
ing on the hostile language di-
rected toward President Bush, es-
pecially because the criticism was
so overblown and scandalous.
Obviously, Chavez was guilty of
ﬁrst-degree exaggerated rhetoric.
Even bleeding-heart liberals like
me don ’t think George Bush came
from Hell. Maybe Purgatory, but
deﬁnitely not Hell.

President Bush himself has
been known to use extreme rheto-
ric to label his enemies. Both
parties have unabashedly used
ﬁre and brimstone politics to their
advantage.

Unsurprisingly, some ra-
bid Bush supporters have been
foaming at the mouth at the op-

portunity to chastise Venezuelan
president for his remarks. His
comments were blatantly disgust-
ing. How could someone come to
our country and say whatever he
wishes? Can’t we do something
about this?

Bush advocates can eas-
ily discard Chavez’s exagger-
ated remarks by arrogantly noting
George W’s lack of Satan-afﬁli-
ated anatomical parts. Where are
those spiky devil horns, they may
ask? Wouldn’t we see his forked
tongue hanging out as he struggles
to answer a tough question?

Quite obviously, the podium’s
sulfuric smell must have come
from something other than Presi-
dent Bush. It was probably that
Noam Chomsky book that the
Venezuelan president was waving
so furiously. Or maybe Chavez
had egg salad for lunch.

In all seriousness, though, if
Chavez’s comments seemed a lit-
tle too close to home, they were.
New York is a much closer venue
for criticism than the oil ﬁelds
of Venezuela or the caves of Af-
ghanistan. Perhaps the United
States is still not accustomed to
such a local threat, even after the
attacks of 9/ l 1.

This close proximity, coupled
with the exalted position of the
United Nations stage, has induced
quite a bit of trepidation for many
Americans that worry about the
security of the country’s foreign
policy.

Frankly, I’m very frightened
by the hostility that America’s
business partner has brought
to our nation. Venezuela is the
fourth largest producer of foreign

oil in the world; unfortunately,
our country absolutely must have
Chavez’s cooperation. This gives
him theability to hold American
foreign policy hostage and to con-
form the United States’ energy
status to his wishes.

Regrettably, our nation has
been held captive too long by
countries that are only our allies
because their oil supply is so vast.
If North Korea struck it big and
suddenly had a huge supply of
Texas tea, do you think we would
continue to criticize their nuclear
proliferation so aggressively?

We haven’t converted to an
alternative energy source because
we ﬁnd it “too hard” to make the
transition. As Americans, it is
both unpatriotic and irresponsible
to compromise our values for the
sake of maintaining the status
quo.

Members of Congress from
both sides of the aisle have start-
ed to realize the extent to which
America’s energy security is en-
dangered. Senator Richard Lugar
(R-Ind.) has repeatedly comment-
ed on the energy problem and
how it has become the “albatross
of U.S. national security.”

We cannot claim independence
from the inﬂuence of rogue coun-
tries until our country’s livelihood
is no longer contingent upon their
cooperation.

Alternative energy sources
have been researched exhaustive-
Iy, and their potential is promis-
ing. It is up to the American peo-
ple to support the government and
push for a better country, a nation
that is secure and independent of
the inﬂuence of our enemies.

Noise distortion

Community and students need to work this out

Last Monday, members of
the community gathered in
public and tore Washington and
Lee students to bits.

They talked about how we
are inconsiderate neighbors and
how we are slowly mining their
property values and their lives.

They trashed us.

What doesn’t make sense is
that we are supposed to be ex-
emplary citizens. We are great
athletes and compassionate vol-
unteers. We are supposed to be
ladies and gentlemen.

But at the Board of Supervi-
sors meeting, we were a bunch
of drunks looking for ways to
cheat the law.

We were spoiled rich kids
hiding behind our parents’ coat-
tails and their wallets.

We were awful.

The Board of Supervisors is
looking at some proposed revi-
sions to the county noise ordi-
nance, and students don’t even
know it’s happening.

The ordinance will end
weekday parties in the country,
and it would eventually phase
out all parties at the standard
places——the Pole Houses and
Windfall Hill.

It would require a permit
system that would allow the
university to take formal action
against individual students for
throwing parties that get out of
control. _

The community is all for it.

And one could easily un-

Iraq: not another Nam

Whatever your stance is on Iraq, stop calling it the next Vietnam

By Abel S. Delgado
CO LUM NIST

In just the ﬁrst year of major
battles, American forces suffered
5,800 casualties. The war seemed
to have no clear direction or pur-
pose. Our men were dying to prop
up a corrupt government that had
nothingyto do with what we call
democracy. No, I’m ‘ not talk-
ing about Iraq. I’m talking about
Vietnam, and those who think the
two wars mirror each other need
to pick up a better history book.

Some opponents of the second
Gulf War have long relied on the
Vietnam War as a crutch to con-
vince others we’re wrong about
Iraq. But whether you agree with
the current war or not, you should
be able to set them apart.

Just look at the numbers. It
took three years for us to even
suﬁ°er half of the casualties in
Iraq that we suffered in Vietnam
in 1966. No reasonable person
thinks 58,000 Americans—the
number who died in Vietnam—
will lose their lives in the current
conﬂict.

Look at the reasons we went
to war in both places. Say what
you want about the missing
WMDs, but the mission is called

Operation Iraqi Freedom. Last
I checked, there is no longer a
homicidal dictator who hires rap-
ists to torture the young daughters
of political prisoners.

Last time I checked, the Iraqis
are voting in one election after an-

I other. Unlike our elections, where

people face no threat of dying
at the polls and still don’t vote,
people are voting in Iraq, lots of
people, and they’re not going to
let some car bomb stop them from
dyeing their ﬁngers purple.

In Vietnam, we went in to
contain communism, not spread
democracy. We had no intention
of liberating the Vietnamese. If
we did we would have fought
both the communist north and the
comipt south. We assumed that
the enemy of our enemy was our
ﬁiends and soon ended up with-
out any friends.

Look at the progress we’ve
made in Iraq compared to our
country. In less than three and
half years they have had open
elections and have written a con-
stitution. It took us ﬁve years to
have any form of government
between the states (which failed)
after we declared independence in
1776, and our constitution didn’t
come until 11 years after that fate-

ful day in July. And yet we say
there is no progress in Iraq.

Did you know there are cur-
rently more women with seats in
the Iraqi Parliament than there
are in our Congress? And we say
they don’t value women’s rights.
You’d be hard-pressed to ﬁnd any
“success stories” like these from
the Vietnam War.

And yet we continue. We keep
on making false comparisons be-
tween a war fought with meaning
and a war that never had a good
meaning. We ignore the prog-
ress and pay attention to the car
bombs. Why? Because it’s easy.
It’s easy to throw in the Vietnam
card, call it a quagmire, and give
up once things get rough.

Thomas Paine once wrote
about “sunshine patriots” who

supported independence just as
long as they didn’t have to suf-
fer for it. And if the argument is
that we shouldn’t make sacriﬁces
for other people’s freedom, then
the French and Spanish shouldn’t
have helped us during the Revo-
lution and we shouldn’t have
liberated Europe from the Nazis,
right?

In no way am I saying the ca-
sualties suffered in Iraq are okay.
One dead is one too many. But if
the opponents of the war really
cared about the soldiers like they
claim to, they would give their
lives, and their mission, its due
signiﬁcance.

In many cases,'the soldiers in
Vietnam had their lives shattered.
In many cases, the soldiers in Iraq
are saving shattered lives.

neighbors talked about how they
couldn’t sleep at night. They
talked about their small children.
They talked about the trash that
ends up in their yards.

The university supports it, too.
They need formal complaints in
order to punish students for off-
campus parties.

It’s just another way they can
control student life.

This noise ordinance guaran-
tees more complaints and stricter
punishments.

The only person who stood up
for the students was the sheriff.

He asked the board to wait
before passing the changes to the
ordinance. He said he thinks the
students can make a difference
without changing the law.

The sheriff is willing to give
us a chance——so why aren’t the
residents?

Because relationships with the
community have gotten that bad.

Or is it because the sheriff
doesn’t live next ‘to Windfall
Hill? ‘

Students did not show up to
argue for themselves. Half the
students we talked to didn’t even
know about it.

In the meantime, the board is
slowly honing a law which will
exclusively attack student party-
ing oﬁ“-campus.

And no one is doing anything
about it.

What is important here is to
make sure that everyone’s rights
are protected——on both sides.

Those neighbors have been

here a long time, too. They pay
high taxes to live in those homes,
which they bought for the peace
of the surrounding mountains.

They are senior citizens and
families with small children and
people who have to wake up early
for a hard day at work.

At the same time, it’s ridicu-
lous to call the sheriﬂ°’s office at
11:30 on a Saturday night.

They have better things to
worry about, like meth labs and
drunk drivers.

College students have a right
to recreation just like everyone
else. When you’re 21 in a town
with no clubs and only one bar,
what exactly are your options?

That doesn’t mean we’re tell-
ing the student body to stop be-
ing neighborly and party like it’s
1999.

We’re just saying that we all
need to work at this together.

How many W&L students
living off-campus actually know
who their neighbors are? Would
you recognize them at Wal—Mart?
Do you know where they work or
who their kids are?

Maybe if we would reach out
to the neighbors, they would be
more understanding of us.

Maybe they wouldn’t mind so
much that we’re students having
a party on a weekend, and maybe
we would have more compassion
for a pregnant woman trying to
get some rest. "

If both groups can understand
each other, then we won’t need
such draconian laws.

Fraternities turn focus away from beer and onto community service

Philanthropy Chairs for the various fraterni-

ties work to involve the men in events that give

back to the community. Without participation

requirements, some frats solve the problem

with yearly events like Derby Days.

By Sarah Klentz
smrr wrmsn

When Washington & Lee stu-
dents think of fraternities, most
think of boys using their creative
genius to generate the best party,
the preppiest outﬁt, and the most
imaginative way to get drunk. Yet
in most of our fraternities’ mis-
sion statements, the words “com-
munity service” are prominent.

Senior Tye Haeberle was the
Campus Outreach Chair for the
Nabors Service League during his
sophomore year.

He said his job was to get the
fraternities more involved and
encourage them to do fraternity-
wide service events.

“We had the hardest time get-
ting frats out to do stuff,” Hae-
berle said. “We would try to get
people to do things, and it was
like pulling teeth.”

Some fraternities do incorpo-

“.?e2s:11s; {.“h:t°istiat'E1e:< same §ﬁ:;':':?’{:.$‘

rate service into their agendas. Ju-
nior Robert Walker, Philanthropy
Chair for Lambda Chi Alpha, said
his fratemity has several orga-
nized events they participate in
throughout the year.

These include volunteering
at a haunted house in October, a
food drive around Thanksgiving,
and sponsoring gifts for a Head
Start class during Christmas.

In addition to other assorted
projects throughout the year, a
few of Lambda’s members adopt-
ed a youth football team that they
are currently coaching.

Walker said that although
Lambda sponsors these events,
they. do not set a requirement as
far as the number of events their
members attend.

“The fraternity doesn’t require
anything, but I personally encour-
age as many people to come as
they can,” Walker said.

He added that most members

attend at least one or two events
each year.

Walker said most fraternities
have “signature events” to either
raise money or give back to the
community, whether it is some-
thing more social like Sigma Chi’s
Derby Days or a blood drive.

Sophomore Jack Fisher, Chi
Psi Philanthropy Chair, said that
Chi Psi’s most popular service
event is the blood drive which
they put on twice a year.

“You’re not just giving money
for some obscure thing,” Fisher
said. “You’re giving literally part
of yourself, your blood, to help
somebody. It’s a pretty important
thing.”

Haeberle said that FIJI en-
courages members to participate
in service, but the fraternity does
not have any set events

“And I hate to say that,” Hae-
berle said.

One of the largest problems in
trying to get fraternity boys in-
volved, Haeberle said, is that very
few people associate the fratemi-
ties with service.

“How many guys decide
where to [rush] based on how
many hours they’ve put in?” Hae-
berle said. “Guys don’t join frats
for the service thing.”

Haeberle added that it does
not mean that fraternity members
have no desire, but that “there’s a

big divide between social events
and service events.”

Fisher said he hopes more
fraternity members will become
more involved so they can change
the image that the fraternities cur-
rently hold.

“Aubrey [Shinoﬁeld, faculty
adviser for Nabors] and [Jason]
Rodocker [director of Campus
Activities and Greek Life] are get-
ting together and trying to make it
easier for fraternity members to
get involved so the image of frats
is less parties and beer cans and

more getting involved in the com- _

munity,” Fisher said.

Walker agreed that the frater-
nities can work together to change
their image.

“Since there are so many of
us here, there’s a large opportu-
nity for us all to get involved,”
Walker said. “The frat system
has a stereotype we can work to
eliminate.”

Senior McNeel Keenan,
a current Campus Outreach
Chair, said that Nabors is trying
to set up projects for groups in
order to encourage fraternities
to get involved together. I

“What we’re trying to do is
set up projects that are orient-
ed to groups so that they can
sponsor something or work on
something together,” Keenan
said. “It’s good because we
can help the fraternity out by
bringing them together while
helping out the community.”

Keenan added that a lot of
fraternity brothers do commu-
nity service on their own.

Nabors is trying to make it
easier for groups to come out
together by coming up with
group projects so that all fra-
ternities have to do is contact
Nabors instead of having to
come up with service activities
on their own, Keenan said.

“Since there are so many of us here, there is

a large opportunity for us all to get involved.

T he frat system has a stereotype we can work

W&L celebrates
Hispanic Heritage
Month

By Whltney Burns
s TA rr w RITE n

Aside from the ever—present
tacos in the Marketplace and gen-
eral education Spanish classes,
many of Washington and Lee’s
students are not exposed to a
culture that differs from their all-
American values.

Within the next month, how-
ever, the opportunity for such ex-
posure will present itself.

The Multicultural Student As-
sociation, with three co-sponsors,
including the Elrod Commons,
are honoring Hispanic Heritage
Month.

This celebration of Hispanic’

and Latino culture kicked off on
September 15, and the festivities
have been occuring ever since.

One of the ﬁrst activities was
a showing of “The Lost City”, a
ﬁlm documenting the Cuban rev-
olution in which power transfered
from Batista to Castro.

There was also a potluck din-
ner at the International House.
This dinner was an opportunity
for members of MSA and Stu-
dent Association for International
Learning (SAIL) to prepare and
share different Hispanic dishes
with one another.

These activities, however, are
not limited to MSA and SAIL
members.

All members of the commu-
nity, including residents of Rock-
bridge County, are invited and
encouraged to participate.

MSA President Quiana McK-
enzie elaborated, saying, “While
[the celebrations] are largely for
the W&L community, we really
want to open it up to everyone,”
she said.

“We understand that the Lex-
ington and Rockbridge areas
could beneﬁt from it as well.”

In the coming weeks, the His-
panic American Youth of Day-
tona, ‘Florida will be performing
traditional and contemporary cul-
tural dances in Lenfest.

W&L students will also be
given the opportunity to show off
their own dancing talent, or lack
thereof, when salsa dancers show
up to give lessons in the Market-
place on October 6.

“They will be playing for four
hours, so you can come in and
dance your heart out,” said McK-
enzie

Aﬂer the break for reading
days, there will be several more
weeks of activities, including a
showing of the Oscar-winning
movie “Frida”, the artist and
wife of Diego Rivera. The 2002
movie is known for its star Salma
Hayek.

Zenaida Mendez also is giving
a lecture, sponsored by KEWL,
at the end of October. Mendez in
the founder of the National Do-
minican Women’s Caucus and is
expected to speak on femicide in
Latin America.

“This is a topic that many peo-
ple don’t talk about,” said McK-
enzie. “She will show a ﬁlm and

then give a very powerful lecture.
It should be exciting.”
More information on the

events of Hispanic Heritage
month can be found online on the
Calendar of Events [httpz//events.
wlu.edu].

There are also reminders for
upcoming events in campus no-
tices.

So now that the door to a more
culturally exposed life has been
opened, what will you do?

McKenzie recommends,
“Bridge the gap between academ-
ics and true cultural experience.”

Cup are the premier intema-
tional competitions for men’s and
women’s professional tennis, re-
spectively.

Well, just to throw stats out at
you, the U.S. has only reached the
ﬁnals in the Davis Cup once since
1997, and has only reached the
ﬁnals of the Fed Cup once since
2000.

Keeping this in mind, it strikes
me as being quite odd that the top
two career money leaders for men
in this sport are American (also
four of the top ten), and two of
the top three women are Ameri-
can (also ﬁve of the top eight).

Moving on. This year was the
ﬁrst year of the World Baseball
Classic. And if you happened to
miss it, you can probably put two
and two together and ﬁgure out
where I’m going by mentioning
it. The U.S., who claims baseball
to be the “American Pastime,”
barely made it out of its ﬁrst
round pool, and went on to lose to
Mexico in the next round. Mex-
ico? Quick, name three Mexican
players. That’s what I thought.
My personal opinion: Get a new
pastime, America.

I could continue, describing
how if it weren’t for a certain mir-
acle and a few sporadic solid ﬁn-
ishes at the Olympics, hockey is
not something Americans should
brag about. Or I could say that
since the existence of the World
Cup, the U.S. Men’s soccer team
has only ﬁnished in the top four

once, (in 1930). Or I could say
that the U.S. has lost three straight
Weber Cups to the Europeans (the
Weber Cup is like the Ryder Cup
of bowling). But I think those
three sports speak for themselves
(although women’s soccer is still
a top program, so props to them).
Anyway, what can we make of
this?

Hmm. To me, (and of course
I am no expert), it seems that
Americans have a tendency to
underachieve in international
competitions. However, we do
quite well elsewhere, where there
may be a good deal more money
involved.

Now it would be an extremely
bold statement if I were to accuse
Americans of caring more about
personal fame and fortune and
less about pride for their country,
which is why I will just imply it.
It just seems that the higher con-
tracts get in American sports, the
worse we do against other coun-
tries. But again, I am no expert.

So to all of you millionaire
American professional athletes
out there who happen to stop by
Washington and Lee speciﬁcally
to read a sports column in The
Ring-tum Phi by a freshman writ-
er, I want you to know that the
secret is out. (We know you care
more about pocketing your $10
million for shooting a basketball
and an ad campaign then you do
about our country’s athletic status
on the world stage). There you
go. I may have whispered it, but
I said it.

Monday Night Sports Beat co-hosts express dismay surrounding sore lack of
attendance at W&L sporting events, ignorance of legends that deﬁned sports

Andy (a.k.a. the Blue Hen):
Hi, Hello and welcome to the
newest segment included in the

' Ring-tum Phi’s sport section,

entitled “Outloud.” If you like
what we have to say, or really
don’t care for it, all I can say is
thank you for taking the time to
read this. And if you want more
of this kind of stuff, listen in to
the Monday Night Sports Beat on
91.5 FM or http://wlur.wlu.edu
on Mondays from 7 — 9p.m.

Neil (a.k.a
the Wolver-
ine): Andy,
this isn’t
radio. You
don’t have to
say Hi, hello

 

and welcome.

The Blue Hen: Oh, ok. Well,
this section of the paper is go-
ing to examine broad themes in
sports and our opinions of these
topics. So to get this kicked oﬂ‘,
I think the biggest positive aspect
in sports is that it can unite people
everywhere. Whether it’s attend-
ing a Washington and Lee football
game or ral-
lying around
a local team
in a difﬁcult
time, sports
is a uniter,
not a divider.
We witnessed
this after 9/ 11 in New York, with
the New York Yankees and a
country, and once again last Mon-
day Night when the city of New
Orleans rallied around the Saints
and inspired them to a 23-3 vic-
tory over the Atlanta Falcons. A

 

lot of articles have outlined the
recent divide between students
and faculty. However, I believe
this can be avoided through the
world of athletics. Here at Wash-
ington and Lee, we have begun
to witness a transformation in
how our fans bring our commu-
nity together. This week, we saw
a packed Warner Center help the
W&L volleyball team achieve a
5 game victory over ODAC rival
Randolph Macon. We also wit-
nessed numerous fans stay to the
very end as Washington and Lee
picked up their ﬁrst ODAC win of
the season over Randolph-Macon,
with freshmen Quarterback R.J.
Vamer leading the way in the sec-
ond half. (On a side note, our best
wishes go out to Hunter Dawkins
for a speedy recovery after break-
ing his collarbone on Saturday.)
However, it is my opinion that
our community, and by commu-
nity I mean our entire community,
is not entirely united. Saturday
at Wilson Field, I watched fewer
students attend the game then I
had witnessed the entire season.
Of those that did attend, many of
them leﬁ at halftime. In addition,
I only saw a handful of profes-
sors and staff in attendance. I ap-
plaud those students and faculty
members for attending sporting
events but want to challenge ev-
eryone to take a more active role
in all aspects of the university.
Washington and Lee is not a ﬁve
day-a- week experience or job.
In fact, it’s a seven day-a-week
experience, with students work-
ing academically, athletically, so-
cially and in clubs or committees
every minute of every day. I’d
like to challenge the student body

and the faculty to take an active
role in uniting this community
through greater involvement in
each other’s lives both in and out
of the classroom. And I person-
ally believe the ﬁrst step in this is
supporting Washington and Lee’s
outstanding athletic teams.

The Wolverine: It’s obvious
that I’ve lowered my standards
since you now ﬁnd me in the Phi,
but I’ll try and make the best of
this situation.

While I am in no way an old
sports fan, I sometimes feel like
it. I know the history of the ma-
jor sports. I know about and rec-
ognize the contributions of men
and women such as Billie Jean
King, Jim Thorpe, Satchal Paige
and Harry Vardon. It saddens
me when sports fans these days
don’t know about these people
or understand their contributions
to their respective sports. I call
on everyone reading this (all 17
of you) to take the time every so
often to learn about the history
of your favorite sport or team.
Learn stories, legends and lore.
Not only does it make you a better
fan, but it also helps these great
people and teams live on for fu-
ture generations.

One great man that is often
overlooked in conversations about
all time sports greats passed away
recently. Byron Nelson, known to
many as Lord Byron for his gen-
tlemanly demeanor and spirit, was
recognized by many as having
one of the most graceful swings
ever, but is probably best known
for having what many consider
the greatest season in golﬁng
history. In 1945, Nelson won 18

tournaments, including an incred-
ible 11 in a row. Many, including
the great Tiger Woods, say that
Nelson’s record is safe forever
(though Tiger’s win streak will
continue after he ﬁnishes tomor-
row’s round). Nelson retired from
golf in 1946, at the age of 34, to
become a rancher. With no mil-
lion dollar paychecks or mega-en-
dorsement deals, Nelson said that
he used to look at each paycheck
as a way to buy some more cattle
or farm equipment. Nelson’s 113
straight cuts in his career are sec-
ond only to Tiger Woods’ 146, but
each those 113 cuts represents a
top-20 ﬁnish, something that is
unparalleled. Woods has only
managed 2] straight top-20 ﬁn-
ishes during his years on tour. In
1968, the PGA Tour renamed the
Dallas Open in his honor. He was
the only golfer to have a tourna-
ment named after them until Ar-
nold Palmer recently had a tour-
nament named after him. Nelson
is one of the greatest golfers ever
and was the last of a generation.

Sports fans out there, take
time to honor the great ones.
Read books like “Paper Lion,” by
George Plimpton, or “Ball Four,”
by former major leaguer Jim
Bouton. Sports now are not as
they once were. In today’s wired
world high school athletes can
suddenly become worldwide ce-
lebrities, while men like Francis
Ouimet have been forgotten long
ago. With Byron Nelson having
recently passed away, and Buck
O’Neill in failing health, sports
fans are losing opportunities to
learn about some of the greatest
athletes ever. Without the past,
there is no future.

THE RING-TUM PHI

1

  Stifled rivalry

Two remotely different cultures that border each
other release tension, agression through athletics

By Mike Huntress
COLUMNIST

Washington and Lee and Vir-
ginia Military Institute coexist
on what are normally perfectly
civil terms. Until Saturday, my
experience with them consisted
solely of them jogging by as I
walk the campus, and my giv-
ing them an uneasy head nod of
acknowledgement, and receiving
an equally uneasy head nod of ac-
knowledgement in return.

Sports bring out that rivalry in
all its intensity, and everyone at
the rugby game on Saturday was
witness to it.

“They think we’re all riﬂe-tot-
ing morons,” VMI rugby player
Garreth Chuna said. “We think
they’re all pink shirt-wearing,
collar-popping queers.”

Rugby is a spectacle in the
same vain as a demolition derby.
In the same way the demoli-
tion derby takes the best parts
of NASCAR (which all but the
sport’s purest fans will admit is
the crashes) and excludes the
monotonous, circular racing part
of it, rugby takes the best parts
of football (the bone crunching
hits) and strings them all together
in one free-ﬂowing outburst of
violence without the whistles and
pauses that characterize football.

Both sides of the ﬁeld --there
is a distinct VMI side and a dis-
tinct W&L side-- can stake claim
to a minimal amount of rugby
knowledge, but the VMI side can
at least claim to be involved in the
game. The quality of the sports
spectatorship on both sides seems
to appropriately ﬁt each school’s
stereotype.

A handful of VMI fans literal-
ly sprinted from end to end along
with the team’s bench as the play
moves on the ﬁeld, wrapped up
in a rugby fervor that stems not
from being tied up with the intri-
cacies of the game, but rather the
palpable feeling of brutality and
sheer aggression that the players
exude. Meanwhile, the W&L side
of the ﬁeld looked like a subdued
frat party, with small social circles
forming around the keg, discuss-
ing things far removed from the

ggneggoing on behind them.

And yeisjthere were indeed a
lot of pink shirts and a handﬁil of
popped collars.

The VMI—W&L annual rugby
game is typically one-sided, and
indeed this year was predicted to
be a decisive victory for the Key-
dets.

Midway through the second
half, with the score at 15-5, fresh-
man player Zachary Bohm de-
scribed the game’s predictions to
me as such: If the game was be-
ing bet on in Las Vegas and you
took W&L, you probably won
some money. We’d have covered
the spread.

In other words, W&L was ex-
pected to lose big.

It’s not hard to fathom why
the game has so much more im-
portance for VMI. Losing to a
group of what I’m sure most ca-
dets would characterize as “pretty
boys” would seem to depreciate a
lot of what they work for.

Just by standing near the VMI
sideline and covertly listening
in on what was being shouted
amongst themselves, it was clear
toughness and intensity are high-
ly regarded virtues.

Standing near the W&L side-
line, a story is told in epic fashion
about an exhausted W&L rugby
player who in the middle of the
game ran over to the sideline,
chugged a beer, and ran back on
the ﬁeld.

Calling the rivalry solely
based on geographical proximity
wouldn’t really do it justice.

The chasm between mutual
understanding is underscored
every time I hear a W&L student

e..-

“In much the same way you cringe when you

witness a car accident, I cringed when I wit-

nessed men doing all they could to tear each

other apart limb by limb. ”

MIKE HUNTRESS columnist

 

say as they pass VMI’s campus,
“I don’t understand why anyone
would want to go there. That
place looks like a prison.”

Staring from sideline to side-
line reveals another differing sen-
sibility. Off on the W&L sideline
are (already well documented
and previously alluded to) pastel
button downs and Ralph Lauren
polos, pink ties and dress shoes,
sundresses and pearl necklaces,
and all other things preppy.

The VMI fans are dressed in
a comfortable, yet common way:
jeans and a sweatshirt with their
school’s name displayed promi-
nently in front--none of the splash
and pizzazz of the W&L sideline.

For all the talk about the way
the two campuses ﬂow seamless-
ly into one another, it’s more like
mixing water and grease. They
mingle, but in a way that only
seems to accentuate the rift that
exists.

A true rugby expert could
more adequately tell you how this
manifested itself on the ﬁeld Sat-
urday, but to an untrained eye like
myself I can only report that the
game wasn’t lacking in intensity.

In much the same way you
cringe when you witness a car ac-
cident, I cringed when I witnessed
men doing all they could to tear
each other apart limb by limb.

The tension was at its apex
when one of the sides took excep-
tion to a particularly hard hit by
the other side. The result was a
pushing and shoving match, full
of male posturing and those stares
that are supposed to assert alpha
status. Any further excitement
was allayedby a VMI cadet who
authoritatively told all the cadets
to calm down and move away
from the W&L players in a man-
ner beﬁtting of a future military
leader.

“Not every guy has a rivalry
with W&L. The guy standing

next to me says he has a rivalry
with you guys, but personally, I
enjoy your guy’s company,” ﬁrst-
classman Chris Guy said.

There was one moment at Sat-
urday’s game that would melt the
heart of even the most hardened
of fans: Rob Rain, one of W&L’s
more prominent students and
rugby players, walks off the ﬁeld
hand pressed tight up against the
side of his head, trying to stop the
trickle of blood.

He looks like a war movie
hero, strolling away from the
ﬁeld of battle, with dirt and mud
mixing with the blood to create a
wound every rugby player could
be proud of. He walks over to the
VMI sideline to ask if they have
bandages, and in an act of high
symbolism, three or four cadets
gather around him and wrap his
head in gauze. While this is going
on only feet from the game behind
them, they talk easily, almost like
war buddies.

After being wrapped, Rain
walked back to his side of the
ﬁeld, and instantly the cadets
became engrossed in the action
again, screaming: “Take him
down!” and “Give him a head
butt!” along with the other unut-
terable profanities bombarding
the ﬁeld from both sidelines. Yet
that one moment of shining civil-
ity, although ﬂeeting, seemed to
rise above all the others as the one
that deﬁnes the rivalry. The game
ended with a VMI win and there
were no overzealous celebration
by the victors and no visible ag-
ony in the losers.

They both got what they came
for. VMI is content to go home
with a win, having showed su-
perior toughness and physical
prowess, and W&L seem seems
equally content to go home hav-
ing proved their own toughness
and worth in the eyes of their
cross town rivals.

Rugby confronts VMI

Writer investigates rules of play, rigorous training schedule of Screaming Minks

By Joel Poelhuls
STA F F W RITE R

Rugby: the fast-paced pass-
ing, unfamiliar terms, and con-
stant movement of the game were
enough to bafﬁe and confuse me
on my ﬁrst and only day of prac-
tice. '

Hailing from Southern In-
diana, the only way I had even
heard of rugby was from certain
students’ Abercrombie shirts and
vague allusions in British-themed
material.

Still, the sport famed for its
tough physical play intrigued me,
and I decided to venture to a prac-
tice here at Washington and Lee.

Only then did it become clear
to me just how little I knew about
a sport with considerable com-
plexities. Rugby is a sport unlike
any other.

The W&L rugby team, the
Screaming Minks, plays by rugby
union rules. This means that each
team has 15 players on the ﬁeld at

a time-—seven backs

Score (the smaller, faster
W&L 10 players) and eight

bers of the pack
VMI 22 mm

(the larger players
who scrum). The
same players stay on the ﬁeld for
both offense and defense.

Players advance the ball by
running forward and throwing
backwards or laterally to other
teammates.

Offensive progress is stopped
by tackling, at which point either
a ruck or maul forms, depending
on whether or not the ball-carrier
has gone to the ground or not.

A player can also advance the
ball by kicking it forward, but the
player who catches it must be be-
hind the kicker when the ball is
kicked.

Scoring is not unlike Ameri-
can football. A team receives ﬁve
points for downing the ball in the
opposing end zone and two points
for kicking through the goal posts
afterwards. Three points through
the goalposts can be scored either
as a penalty kick or by drop-kick-
ing during play.

Sophomore treasurer Sean
McKinley described the game

Sophomore Josh Prell escapes a tackle from a Virgi

as “a combination between foot-
ball and soccer,” because there is
physical tackling, but gameplay
does not stop.

_ McKinley played football in
high school and added that the
lack of equipment is hard to get
used to when tackling.

Gameplay aside, one of the
more unique things about rugby
is the sportsmanship and more
laid-back atmosphere. There is
usually a keg at the Minks’ home
ﬁeld, Highland Belle, during half-
time.

“It’s a tradition that one team
will always invite the other to
their after-party,” McKinley said.
“Sportsmanship is very important
on and off the ﬁeld ”

Practice, however, is all busi-

ness. Most practices consist of
about 15 minutes of sprint exer-
cises, 45 minutcs of work split up
into the backs and the pack, and
one hour of full-on scrimmaging.

Every two weeks or so, the
team ﬁnds a more unique method
of conditioning. A keg is placed at
an off-campus house and the team
assembles and runs a roundabout
way, usually at least two miles, to
the keg.

Leading the Minks are coach
Tom Lovell, team captains Rob
Wilson and Dan Ward, and club
president Roberto “Tino” Tovo.

Since rugby is a club, rather
than varsity sport, Tovo is respon-
sible for administration, travel,
and organizing matches as well as
on-the-ﬁeld duties.

XC sees success

Men, women set ambitious goals for end of season

By Lara Jordan
STAFF warren

The goal of both the women’s
and men’s cross country team this
year is to win the ODAC Cham-
pionship, making it three in a row
for the women and two in a row
for the men.

“Winning three years in a row
for both teams from a school has
never happened in the history of
the ODAC, but then either did
two in a row,” said women’s
coach Kris Hoey.

The women’s team has ﬁn-
ished seventh out of 27 teams at
the Paul Short Invitational, ﬁrst
out of 10 teams at the Washington
and Lee invitational, ﬁfth out of
28 squads at the NYU Invitational
and sixth out of nine teams at the
Maroon Invitational, hosted by
Roanoke College.

The men’s team has placed
10th out of 26 at the Paul Short
Invitational, ﬁrst out of seven
teams at the W&L Invitational
and third out of 35 teams at the
NYU Invitational.

The women contribute their
successes to a strong team dy-
namic.

“Everyone is truly out for the
team and not for themselves,”
said Hoey.

“They know if they improve
they will in turn help others im-

prove too. Everyone on the team
wants to succeed.”

The men see their advantage as
that of the practice environment.

“The environment for training
in Lexington is very beneﬁcial
to us,” said junior Tom Brower.
“Our course is currently the high-
est rated course in terms of tough-
ness in the state of Virginia.”

Despite a large number of un-
derclassman, Hoey looks forward
to a strong season.

“Some other teams may look
at our roster and see quite a few
freshmen and take that as a dis-
advantage for us, but really all
of our freshmen are very mature
runners who come from strong
backgrounds,” said Hoey.

Health has been a disadvantage
to the men’s team this season.

“The team’s biggest issue right
now is staying healthy,” said ju-
nior Steve Rivoir. “We are a little

thinner than years past and cannot
afford to have any injuries to our
top runners.”

The men’s team has been
working hard to train new mem-
bers.

“Freshmen are expected to
play a signiﬁcant role on the team
here,” said Brower.

“We want them to learn how
to race an 8K and understand how
Coach Tucker’s training program
works from a physiological per-
spective.”

The teams’ are optimistic
about ﬁnishing the season.

“Our team has fresh new out-
look on what Cross Country at
Washington and Lee can be and is
becoming,” said Hoey.

Both teams return will com-
pete at the Virginia State Division
I1-III Meet at Peak View Farms
in Harrisonburg, Va on Saturday,
Oct. 7.

Tovo attributes much of the
team’s dominance this year to
their activities last spring.

“We went to Argentina last
spring break, and we played
against really tough teams. Argen-
tine teams are some of the better
ones in football. We even had a
coach from the Argentina national
team train us,” Tovo said.

Pushing the envelope against
tough teams has enabled the
Minks to post an unbeaten 3-0
record in the conference. Their
overall record is 3-2 after a hard
fought 22-10 loss to Division I
VMI on Saturday.

tencacity of the Minks’ defense.

Traditionally. VMI defeats
W&L by a much larger margin.

“It was amazing. They are
much bigger and stronger, and we
were tackling them like it didn’t
matter,” said Tovo.

The team aspires to win the
Ed Lee Invitational this year, hav-
ing already been invited due to
their record.

If the Minks prevail in the In-
vitational, they will move up to
Division II competition.

With all the ﬁne points and
rules, rugby, like any other sport,
comes down to conditioning,
toughness, and teamwork.

Said McKinley: “I still don’t
know all the rules.”

America falls short
in realm of sports

Freshman claims  athletes
are under-achieving globally

ball talent in the world, both the
men’s and women’s U.S. teams
received third place.

Additionally, in the 2004
Olympics, our supposed “Dream
Team” ﬁnished third as well,
which sounds like more of a
nightmare to me. Since when are
we the third best in anything, es-
pecially basketball?

How is it that ﬁfteen of the top
sixteen scorers in the NBA are
American, yet we lose to teams
like Argentina?

This year at the Ryder Cup, the
Europeans defeated the United
States 18 ‘/2 to 9 ‘/2. And no, in
this case it is not good to have the
lower score.

A similar score has resulted
from the past three Ryder Cups
(six years), and from the looks
of things, it doesn’t appear that
Tiger, Phil, and the rest of the
American crew are looking to
change their status.

How is it that seven of the
top ten career money leaders are
American, (all of whom have par-
ticipated in the past three Cups),
and yet we fail to challenge the
inferior Europeans?

Cup are the premier international
