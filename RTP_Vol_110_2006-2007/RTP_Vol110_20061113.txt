Playoff time for football

Despite Saturday ’s loss to Case Western Reserve, football
will face undefeated Wilkes University in the D-Illplayojfs

By Brlan Devlne
STAFF WRITER

In the best Washington & Lee
football season since 1981, the
boys in blue have won a confer-
ence title.

The Generals football team
capitalized on their chance to win
the ODAC, beating Emory and
Henry 24-6 in front of a stand-
ing-room only Parents’ Weekend
crowd of 6275 at Wilson Field.

The championship carries with
it an automatic berth in the Divi-

sion III postseason, the Generals‘-
ﬁrst appearance since 1951. The
blue-and-white are the number
eight seed in the East region and
will travel to Wilkes University
in Wilkes—Barre, Pennsylvania on
Nov. 18. Their opponent posted a

10-0 record in the regular season,

winning the Middle Atlantic Con-
ference championship.

Traveller overwhelmed by riders

Students say they are frustrated by long lines for Traveller Express system and are turning insteaa’ to the dispatch drivers

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

Those involved in running
Traveller, Washington and Lee
University’s safe ride program,
are looking for answers to in-
creasing demand being put on the
program by students.

Increased ridership has left
Traveller Express, the shuttle bus
service that runs Wednesday, Fri-
day and Saturday nights, facing
long lines of students for which
they do not have room. Travel-
ler Dispatch, the student-run ear
and van service, has been under
increasing pressure to help carry
the rides the Express service can’t
handle.

“The Traveller committee is
aware of the frustration students

have,” said Kaylee Hartung. stu-
dent chair for Traveller. Hartung
said that the programs resources
are already being “pushed to the
limit” in an effort to accommodate
as many students as possible.

Still, students are ﬁnding it
difﬁcult to cope.

Overcrowding on the Traveller
Express system is ‘causing many
students to resort to either call-
ing Traveller Dispatch system or
walking even when drunk rather
than try to get on the buses on
busy party nights.

As one sophomore student,
who wished to remain anony-
mous so as not to be implicated
in underage drinking said. "'It’s
ridiculous how long you have to
wait sometimes."

Frustrations came to a head

“But just because most of us are drunk at the

time doesn ’t mean we ’re stupid. We knowfull

buses mean you won ’t be getting on for a while. 

ANONYMOUS STUDENT, Class of.2009
 

during Homecoming weekend
_when angry and drunk alumni at-
tacked several Express drivers.
Mila Sugovic, a dispatcher for
the Traveller Dispatch, said that a
good deal of calls from students
asking for a ride come as a re-
sult of the students thinking they

would not be able to be served by‘

the Express buses.
Sugovic said most students
who call do so either when a bus

that is full passes by or when they
notice a large crowd at the Ex-
press stops and don’t believe they
will be able to get on the next few
buses.

“We know that the drivers
really enforce the bus capacity
rules,” said the sophomore.

“But just because most of us
are drunk at the time doesn't mean
were stupid. We know full buses
mean you won’t be getting on for

a while,” said the sophomore.

She said her solution is usu-
ally to call Traveller Dispatch and
hope they can handle her.

Relying on the Dispatch when
Express buses are f11ll puts a strain
on the system.

During the month of October
alone, Dispatch reported trans-
porting l,454‘students.

Hartung said the Traveller
committee is aware that the ser-
vice is under pressure.

She said the program wants to
expand capacity by adding a third
car -- along with the accompany-
ing driver and gas money.

“I think it would be possible
for that to happen by next year,”
Hartung said.

She said that expanding Trav-
eller”s services “is a matter of dol-

lars."

“Right now we are doing ev-
erything in our power to save up
the funds to make that happen,”
said Ilartung.

Hartung also said that Travel-
ler coordinators and Goff Trans-
portation, the company chartered
to run the Express buses, are talk-
ing about the challenges currently
facing the sober ride system, es-
pecially the large buses.

Hartung said that ways to im-
prove service for the schools 300
law students is also a priority.

Traveller also wants to cut
wait times for the Express and
Dispatch sections of the organiza-
tion.

Hundreds of Jim Webb and George Allen signs line the sidewalk in front of Lexington’s only voting place. Webb defeated the incumbent Allen by about 9000 votes statewide.

Locals Vote in

large numbers

Residents in Lexington help Webb win a tight election, but
citizens in the county turn out to vote for Sen. George Allen

By Jacob Geiger and Dane
Davls
NEWS EDITOR AND STAFF WRITER

Voters turned out in large num-
bers Tuesday across Rockbridge
County, easily trouncing turnout
numbers from previous mid-terrn
elections.

A highly contested senatorial
election and a controversial mar-
riage amendment to the state con-
stitution drew the most interest.

“I am more interested this
year,” Lexington resident Nellie
Reynolds said. “It is much more
crowded. Last year I was just in
and out.”

Mary Tabbut also said the poll-
ing station was unusually busy.

“I always vote,” she said. “I
started with Roosevelt in the
1940s when I was living in Mas-
sachusetts.”

The amendment to deﬁne mar-
riage as a union between a man
and a woman passed easily. The
Senate race, however, was far
more competitive.

Incumbent George Allen ﬁnal-
ly conceded the race on Thursday
to challenger Jim Webb, a former
secretary of the Navy. Since he
was only trailing by 9128 votes
out of more than 2.3 million cast,
Allen could have demanded a
state-wide recount.

Voters in Lexington braved the
rain and long lines at the city’s
rescue squad building. Nearly 55
percent of the city’s registered
voters came to the polls. Two
in three of the voters supported
Webb and voted against the pro-
posed marriage amendment.

Voters in the county and Bue-
na Vista strongly supported Allen
and voted for the amendment.

At the Lexington polling sta-
tion, there was a steady stream of
voters throughout the day. Though
lines occasionally stretched out of
the room and into the hallway,
voting was moving smoothly and

quickly.

“I have been working about 15
years,” poll worker Pree Ray said,
“and this is by far the busiest [I
have seen]. It is bigger even than
2004.”

The 2004 presidential elec-
tion had a national voter turnout
of about 55 percent. In Lexington
and Rockbridge County, however,
nearly seven in ten voters went to
the polls.

Ray and fellow worker Lynda
Gordon said crowds have also
increased since the city switched
from two polling places down to
just one. The city’s current poll-
ing station has ﬁve electronic vot-
ing machines on hand.

During last fall’s govemor’s
election, slightly more than half
of the voters in Lexington and
Rockbridge County came to the
polls.

During that election, the city
voted heavily for Democrat Tim
Kaine, while the county narrow-
ly supported Republican Jerry
Kilgore.

Kaine defeated Kilgore by
more than 100,000 votes state-
wide. »

D.J. Nick, an election page,
said he and other seniors at Rock-
bridge County High School were
helping voters understand the ma-
chines, which were ﬁrst used in
the 2005 gubernatorial election.
Nick and the other election pages
are A.P. Government students at
Rockbridge County high school.

“We explain how to work the
ballots,” Nick said. “We have to
be pretty non-partisan. We can-
not explain the amendments — we
just hand out the pamphlet that
explains them.”

Poll worker Lenwood H.
Johnson said voting ran smoothly
throughout the day.

“We have been very busy, with
a good turnout today. It seems
similar to 2004. First thing this
morning was busy, but it has been

steady all day.”

This year’s turnout easily
eclipsed turnout from the 2002
elections, when Sen. John War-
ner was handily re—elected. That
year about 1.5 million voters ~
or 40 percent of those registered
— came to the polls.

The only recent elections to
beat this year were 2000 and
2004, both presidential elec-
tions. Voter turnout is tradition-
ally far stronger during those
years.

Webb’s victory marked a
stunning turnaround in a cam-
paign that three months ago
seemed to be ﬁnished.

Then on Aug. 11, 2006, Al-
len called one of Webb’s cam-
paign workers a “macaca.” In
some parts of Africa, the word is
a racial slur that means monkey.
Allen said he simply made the
word up and did not intend to
insult Webb’s staffer.

S.R. Sidarth, the man to
whom Allen was referring, is a
American citizen of Indian an-
cestry.

From that point forward, the
Allen campaign lost its momen-
tum and gradually sunk lower in
the polls. During the ﬁnal weeks
of the campaign, most polls said
the candidates were at a dead
heat.

When the national press was
not busy rehashing Allen’s com-
ments, it focused on each man’s
footwear.

Allen has long been known
for wearing cowboy boots.
Webb countered by wearing the
combat boots his son--a Marine-
-wore before going to Iraq.

Webb’s victory cemented
Democratic control of the Sen-
ate by a 51-49 margin. The up-
coming session will be the ﬁrst
time 1994 that Democrats have
controlled both chambers of
Congress.

NPR ethics man kicks off forum

Department of journalism brings in Jeﬂrey Dvorkin to kick oﬂ school is 42nd Institute of Ethics in

By Jacob Geiger
N EWS EDITOR

Former National Public Radio
ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin told
an audience of journalists on Fri-
day that their profession has work
to do if it wants to regain the trust
of Americans.

“Only by" being completely
honest with our audience will we
regain their trust,” Dvorkin said.

During his time as NPR’s om-
budsman, Dvorkin was respon-
sible for monitoring things like
accuracy and fairness in the com-
pany’s broadcasts. He had previ-
ously served as vice president of
NPR’s news division.

Dvorkin left NPR in June to
take a position as the executive
director for the Committee of
Concerned Journalists. In his ﬁ-
nal post as ombudsman, Dvorkin
said his job was to “mediate be-
tween listeners and journalists in
the interests of good journalism.”

When Dvorkin accepted NPR

President Kevin Klose’s offer to
become the organization’s ﬁrst
ombudsman, NPR became the
ﬁrst major broadcast news orga-
nization to hire someone in that
role. Many major newspapers
also employ ombudsmen.

When he created the ombuds-
man post in 2000, Klose — a for-
mer writer and editor at The Wash-
ington Post - said he had liked the
idea of an ombudsman when he
was working for the Post.

As ombudsman, Dvorkin re-
ceived calls, letters, and e-mails
from thousands of listeners each
week. He estimated on Friday
that during his six year term he
heard from more than 750,000
listeners.

Dvorkin, who was born in
Calgary, worked for the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation before
moving over to NPR.

Dvorkin discussed how jour-
nalism has changed during the
last century and how journalists
can cope with those changes.

We have at our disposal a vast array of facts...

but fewer journalists working in the newsrooms

to make sense of those facts.

JEFFERY DVORKIN, Former NPR Ombudsman

“When my grandfather was
living in Vienna between World
War I and World War II, he read
12 newspapers a clay,” Dvorkin
said. “In a city of about 3 mil-
lion people, there were 26 news-
papers.”

He also discussed the changing
trends in reporting. Whereas CBS
had 38 foreign correspondents in
the late l980s, Dvorkin said, to-
day they have only ﬁve. He wor-
ried that the repeated downsiz-
ing of most news organizations
makes it harder for journalists to
do thorough reporting.

“We have at our disposal a vast

the Express service has in-
creased its capacity by up-
grading from four buses that
carry 10-12 passengers to 3
buses that carry 10-12 and a
fourth that can carry 24-25
people.

Hartung hoped to have
two 24-25 passenger busses
by next year.

Sugovic had another idea,
saying that it would be nice
for the Dispatch service if
they could contact Express
drivers.

“Sometimes we don’t
know what’s going on,” said
Sugovic.

Another suggestion made
by both students and driv-
ers to address overcrowding
problems would be a change
in the way the Express buses
run.

Many students complain

Sober rides tough to ﬁnd

"All I want to do is go from the Pole
Houses to Windfall, but the bus would go
the entire route back through town. ”

ANONYMOUS FRESHAMN, Class of 2010

that on a night when parties
are only being held in one or
two areas, the buses still run
through their full circuit.
“All I want to do is go from
the Pole Houses to Windfall,
but the bus would go the en-
tire route back through town,”
said one freshman girl, who
declined to be named. She
did not want to publicly crit-
cize a program she otherwise
“loved and appreciated.”
Sugovic had a similar line
of thought, saying she be-

,.‘

lieved it would be more ef-
ﬁcient for Golf to take into
consideration where the big
parties are on a given night.

Sugovic said that way
crowds of students looking
to go to similar destinations
would not have to wait as
long.

Hartung said a variety of
changes are deﬁnitely being
considered.

Said Hartung, “the bottom
line is we want to get every-
one home.”

array of facts. . .but fewer journal-
ists working in the newsrooms to
make sense of those facts.”

He said journalists face sever-
al issues as they continue to move
forward. Some of those issues
focus on the reporting side of the
business, like determining how
reliable sources are and separat-
ing rumor from fact.

Dvorkin also said journalists
must decide how to handle allega-
tions from the public about bias.

He asked if journalists owed
allegiance to the public or to the
parent organizations that hire and
pay the reporters.

The former ombudsman also
spent some time discussing the
media’s coverage of terrorism and
the war in Iraq. He said that he
worries journalists will be labeled
unpatriotic when they choose to
air disturbing or graphic footage
from the war-zone.

As an example, he mentioned
footage of Iraqi insurgents that
CNN had obtained. The footage
shows insurgents sitting in a car,
waiting to shoot American sol-
diers. The video fades to black
when the insurgents open ﬁre, but
over the audio feed the men can
be heard praising Allah.

When CNN ran that footage,
Congressman Duncan Hunter, the
outgoing Chairman of the House

. Armed Services Committee, ac-

cused the network as serving as a
“publicist for the insurgents.”
Dvorkin said he thinks the
network was just showing Ameri-
cans the unvamished truth about
the war.
“Americans have a right to

know what the troops are endur-
ing in Iraq,” Dvorkin said. My
fear is that in the event of another
terrorist attack, the opinions of
[Hunter] would become [more
prominent].”

He said that journalists, like
most Americans, were shocked
by the events of Sept. I 1 and have
struggled since then to ﬁgure out
how they should cover the ongo-
ing wars.

“Frequently journalists were
asked by other journalists if they
were Americans ﬁrst or joumal-
ists ﬁrst,” Dvorkin said.

Dvorkin said journalists need-
ed to remember two important
things as their profession contin-
ued to move forward.

“We need to remind ourselves
and our audience that journal-
ism is not stenography, [and] we
need to tell our audiences how we
know what we know.”

the team from the quarter-
back position before a sickening
tackle against Randolph-Macon
on Sept. 30 left him with a broken
collarbone and a senior season cut
short.

With Dawkins graduating, the
reins of the program are squarely
in the hands of the freshman from
Birmingham.

Vamer will have the continued
help of Stuart Sitterson, a sopho-
more who returned from injury
against‘ Emory and Henry to run
for 98 yards and gain 44 yards on
returns after missing all of the
previous game against Bridgewa-
ter.

That game, where the Generals
also missed do-everything senior
Colton Ward, was the team’s only
conference loss. Ward and Sit-
terson have been essential to the
team’s success, not only against
Emory and Henry, but all season
long.

Vamer said the two are “not
also

only great players but 
great leaders.”

Sitterson’s statistics have been
indicative of his team’s achieve-

ments. In the Generals’ three
losses this season, Sitterson has
gained an average of 13 yards per
game. In their seven victories, he
rushed for 53 yards per game.

W&L’s game plan depends
on solid running from Sitterson
and Ward to set up receiver Jack
Martin, who has over 500 yards
receiving on the season, including
59 yards in the title-clinching vic-
tory over Emory and Henry.

Often lost in the shuﬁie among
such offensive talents as Martin
and Ward is the Generals’ stellar
defense, 20"‘ in the nation in points
allowed and the conference’s best
in turnover margin.

Generals comerback Mark
Snoddy has nine interceptions
on the season, one away from the
school record. The Generals were
the only ODAC team to shut down
Guilford’s top-ranked passing of-
fense and played well in the loss
to Case Western Reserve, where
17 of the Spartans’ 29 points were
scored directly off turnovers.

The Generals’ loss on Satur-
day, in a non-conference game
with no bearing on the postsea-
son, was due mainly to the play of
Case Western senior Brian Calde-

rone. He returned a fumble for a
touchdown, sacked ,Varner four
times, and converted two ﬁeld
goals.

Despite the loss to Case West-
ern, which players described as
“sloppy” and “miserable,” the
Generals are in the postseason for
the ﬁrst time since New Year’s
Day 1951, where W&L lost to
Wyoming in the Gator Bowl.
Conference championships did
not always carry an automatic
berth in the postseason. This sea-
son’s squad, a talented bunch but
a far cry from the legendary I950
outﬁt, learned their fate on Sun-
day afternoon, when the NCAA
revealed the Division III playoff
bracket.

Wilkes ﬁnished the season
seventh in the country, and quar-
terback Al Karaffa will represent
the Generals’ most formidable op-
ponent this season. W&L faces a
serious uphill battle as Sitterson is
listed as questionable for the game
after re-injuring the right ankle
that caused him to miss the loss at
Bridgewater. Without him, a sea-
son for the ages may end on the
banks of the Susquehanna River
on Nov. 18 at Ralston Field.

e thankful for
your dining staff  

Picking up after students not responsibility of employees

By Grace Andrews
C 0 L U M N I ST

Today’s topic is one that is
near and dear to my heart: giving
thanks!

As we all prepare ourselves to
have a week of vacation in which
we do nothing but eat, I think we
should not forget what the holi-
day is about.

No, it’s not just about Granny’s
homemade dressing and gravy, or
rnom’s old family recipe for sweet
potato pie, and it’s not even about
that scrumptious (ﬁll in the blank)
turkey, ham, or random fowl that
you will have the pleasure of eat-
ing.

It’s about being thankful for
the small things in life that are
sometimes taken for granted.

In my opinion, lthink that the
security, maintenance and dining
services are some of the things we
never stop to be thankful for.

These wonderful people work
hard to make sure that the Com-
mons is safe, clean, and full of
food.

Now, I have always stated
that anyone who feeds me is my
friend and that goes for the staff
in D-hall and Cafe ’77.

I do not get to eat in D-hall
as often as would like, but I had
the rare pleasure of eating there
four or ﬁve times in the past two
weeks.

Each time I ate there, I was
disgusted.

No, it was not the food. It was
the people, or more importantly
what the people did after eating

Win not exactly success

Allen is moral inadequacy led to his fall, and Webb Should never forget it

By Dylan Merrlll
c o LU M N I sr

Virginia is proof that democ-
racy still exists in America.

Here’s why:

Most of us paid attention to the
U.S. Senate race between incum-
bent Republican George Allen
and his “capital-D” Democratic
challenger Jim Webb, or at least
know of its existence.

These guys have been the sub-
ject of a media blitz, in which ev-
ery aspect of their campaigns has
been inspected and probed.

If you’ve watched CNN in the
past weeks, you couldn’t have
missed Allen’s faded glory pig-

' skin passes and the ubiquitous

“I’m Jim Webb, and I wear army
boots” segment.

A few months ago, most Belt-
way pundits had chalked up Sen.
Allen as the winner, giving Jim
Webb only a nominal chance for
the upset.

Allen’s famous football coach
dad and native son persona have
helped him ﬁnd notoriety and
popularity within Virginia poli-
tics.

In fact, many Democrats ex-
pressed disapproval when Senator
Chuck Schumer (D—NY) of New
York authorized party assistance
for Webb’s campaign against the
popular congressman and ex-gov-
emor.

Some racially question-
able comments made by Allen,
though, proved to be the end of

To my horror, people left their

. I was shocked and repulsed to
see that it was not just one person
at a table committing this D-hall
offense. There were many plates
at multiple tables.

Now, why in grilled burgers
and turkey wraps would someone
leave their trash for someone else
to clean up?

The men and women who
work in D-hall are not paid to put

Frankly, it ’s not in their job de-

When is the last time that you

of college students?

No, seriously, put yourself in
the well-pressed blue shirts of
dining service and imagine how it
would feel if every day you had
the pleasure of putting away nap-

kins and dishes and then wiping

down the tables.

I mean, who does not love ex-
tra work that is entirely unneces-
sary?

I know I do! (sarcasm intend-
ed)

Nevertheless, for a campus
that prides ourselves on respect,

integrity, and all those other great
attributes that build a strong char-
acter, we are not practicing what
we preach.

I was not supposed to write an

' article this week, but in the spirit

of giving thanks, I wanted to
thank some people on campus.

As I stated before, the dining
and cleaning services staff are my
friends.

I am ﬁercely loyal to those
who I give such a title, enough so
that I must speak out against such
atrocious displays of good man-
ners.

As Thanksgiving approaches,
I implore you to be thankful for
the people who work so hard for
us with little recognition and ap-
preciation.

Let us do this by cleaning up
after ourselves and making their
jobs a little easier.

The moral of the story is: clean
up after yourself, do not leave
your mess for others, and do not
let me catch you doing so.

I would hate to write another
article and have to name a few
perpetrators of crimes against
cleanliness, e-mail addresses in-
cluded!

Have a great break, and bon
appetit!

Some say that their vote doesnt

his campaign. Apparently, he was
unaware that calling a young man
of Indian descent “Macaca” was
an insult.

The ever-attentive media
caught Allen’s mistake and turned
into a full-scale scandal. I wonder
if Sen. Allen’s father was watch-
ing as his son’s fumble cost his
party the game.

The expressions on the Repub-

licans’ faces were grim as they

lowered their Gatorade cooler and
walked away from the sideline.

But then again, the fact that
Macaca-gate occurred in the ﬁrst
place is not that surprising.

Washington insiders are no-
toriously bad at grasping simple
moral values (see Mark Foley’s
naptime niceness and William
.Iefferson’s frozen assets).

I’m not insinuating that
George Allen is a pedophile or a
crook, only that it is appropriate
that a notoriously narrow-minded
congressman was ousted because
of his poorly veiled bigotry.

Some might say that the close-
ness of the Virginia Senate race
shows the unfairness of our elec-
toral process.

How is it reasonable to be-
lieve that the smear tactics of an
overblown political scandal justly
determines the outcome of an im-
portant election?

That’s a fair point, but you
must still understand that the
loss was ultimately instigated by
George Allen’s mistakes.

If more people thought that
Allen was still the best candidate,
then he obviously would have
won. Many people had strong
convictions and were concerned
with the issues at stake, but they
still did not vote.

Some say that their vote
doesn’t matter; what’s one per-
son’s vote amongst many?

The journalist Hunter S.
Thompson struggled to deal
with this feeling of voter apathy.
Thompson, however, realized the
danger of such disillusionment.
“No one is stealing our free-
doms,” he noted, “we’re dealing
them away.”

Still, to some, the threat of los-
ing liberty is less pressing than
their lack of motivation. The
uselessness of adding one vote to
millions others, to them is an ex-

 

editorial

  Elect me baby,

one more time

The never-ending election cycle has got to stop

Election day is almost
here, again.

Six days after wrapping
up another nasty year of po-
litical mudslinging, everyone
in Washington D.C. is talking
about elections again.

This time, the subject is
2008. Even though that elec-
tion is one year and 51 weeks
away, Wisconsin Sen. Russ
Feingold announced yester-
day that he would not seek
the Democratic presidential
nomination.

Hmm. Let’s take a count.
Two years from now, who
will care who said they might
run?

This week, both politicians
and pundits are taking stock
of the new Democratic major-
ity in both chambers of Con-
gress. Why bother? All 435
representatives and 33 sena-
tors are getting ready for the
2008 elections.

Democrats liked to com-
plain that the old Republican
controlled Congress was a
“do-nothing Congress.” But
we would be shocked if the
new party in power suddenly
becomes a beacon of effi-
ciency.

Let’s face it. When Con-
gress opens its 110*” Session

in January, it will be business
as usual.

Politicians from both par-
ties will get up and make
pompous, posturing speeches
that rip into their opponents.
Then those supposed oppo-
nents will turn around and
help each other secure ear-
marks for their home states
and districts.

Even when the two parties
cannot ﬁnd a consensus on is-
sues like Iraq, immigration, or
the Patriot Act, they all man-
age to agree on the spending
bills. Pork barrel projects, it
seems, are the last bastion of
bipaitisanship.

And even when the Sen-
ate can tear its attention away
from sending record windfalls
back to their home states, they
will have plenty of campaign-
ing to worry about.

The following Senators
have either already announced
they will run for President in
2008 or are thinking about
running: John McCain, John
Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Barack
Obama, Evan Bayh, Chris-
topher Dodd, Joe Biden, and
Sam Brownback.

That means eight Sena-
tors are going to be focusing
on the Presidency instead of

listening to their constituents.
Those Senators come from
both parties, so both Repub-
licans and Democrats are put-
ting their own interests ahead
of the people they were elect-
ed to serve.

Several governors and a
few representatives may also
jump into the campaign. You
can bet on each of them ignor-
ing their constituents to focus
on campaigning.

Heck, some of those peo-
ple have been thinking about
the Presidential election since
the ﬁnal tallies from the 2004
race were announced.

Since political analysts are
estimating that serious candi-
dates will need an initial bank
account of $60 million to
mount a serious primary cam-
paign, most of these potential
candidates have already be-
gun raising money.

And since you cannot raise
$60 million overnight, those
candidates will be focusing
on fundraising instead of leg-
islating.

Maybe the new Congress
will surprise us. Maybe some-
thing will actually get done
during the next two years.

We’ll believe it, when we
see it.

ercise in futility.

But that’s the exhilarating

thing about voting. My vote was
one of more than 2 million, but
Jim Webb’s margin of victory was
about 7,000 votes, roughly equiv-
alent to the number of people at a
poorly attended rodeo.

Not only did my vote con-
tribute to the narrow success of
Virginia’s next senator, but it
also tipped the scales of majority
power in the Senate towards the
Democrats.

With a 15-minute trip to the
voting center on a rainy Tuesday,
I and millions of others earned the
right to criticize our government
and fulﬁlled our duty to partici-
pate in the operation of our gov-
emment.

The people of Virginia decided
that George Allen no longer rep-
resents their interests.

In an election whose outcome
could hardly be closer, Jim Webb
can’t assume that he has won a
treasure chest of political capital.

Politicians tend to translate
victory at the polls into a certiﬁ-
cate of divine right.

However, electoral success is
not a permission slip that allows
congressmen to graﬂiti the halls
of Congress.

Politicians should always con-
sider themselves the lesser of two
evils.

If they can’t, they will even-
tually become the greater of two
evils, and they will be voted out.

That’s democracy.

Opportunities overseas

International education drawing large crowds-, oﬂering numerous expeditions abroad during six-week Spring term

By Sarah Klentz
STAFF WRITER

Spring term is often coveted
by Washington and Lee students
as a time to relax outside, enjoy
warm Lexington weather and
ﬂoat down the Maury River while
still taking classes.

However, many students are
taking advantage of W&L’s wide
range of Spring term abroad op-
portunities.

This spring, students will
travel to a wide variety of loca-

tions, including Italy, China, New
Zealand, India and Brazil. In ad-
dition, a range of departments are
giving students the opportimity to
study a range of subjects such as
art, language, politics, business
and science overseas.

English professor Marc Con-
ner is leading a trip to Ireland for
the fourth time this spring.

He said one concern that stu-
dents have with traveling during
Spring term is that six weeks is
not be enough time to fully im-
merse oneself in the culture.

“[The program] is so intensive;
students will be in the ﬁeld 50-60
hours a week,” Conner said.

“It really is an immersion into
the culture. Spending more time
doesn’t always mean having a
better experience.”

Conner said another advantage
of going abroad during Spring
term is the ability to use the W&L
professors’ knowledge to the full-
est.

“For six weeks students are
traveling with an absolute expert
in the ﬁeld,” Conner said.

“They’re not in a tour group
setting. They’re with an academic
guide who knows the students and
the university. Other programs
can’t match that.”

Sophomore Galina Yudovich
will be traveling with Conner and
19 other students to Ireland this
spring. She said the program will
give her a new prospective on lit-
erature.

“It’s a way for students to study
literature where it was originally
written,” Yudovich said.

“We can understand the physi-
cal and cultural surroundings the
author saw and experienced.”

Yudovich said it is especially
important for W&L students to
experience the world beyond
Lexington.

“A lot of students here are from
an environment a lot like W&L,
and a lot are going into business
or economics,” Yudovich said.

“Going abroad and seeing how

 
 

other people live culturally and
economically will broaden their
understanding of the concepts
they’re learning here.”

Journalism professor Pam Lu-
ecke is leading students to China
with business professor Kip
Pirkle.

Luecke spoke of the impor-
tance of taking journalism and
business students to China. '

“We’re convinced that Chi-
na will be such a force in these
students’ lives and careers that
they’ll need to see it ﬁrst hand,”
Luecke said.

“It seemed like a logical de-
cision to show students China’s
business and economic growth
and how the news media is cover-
ing it.”

Luecke said an experience
in China will broaden students’
views of international relations.

“Students will be working
and living in a truly international
community,” Luecke said.

“Until you look outside our
country, you can’t understand
how we’re viewed by the rest
of the world. This trip could be
life-changing and open their eyes
to careers in other parts of the
world.”

Sophomore Emily Deddens
will be traveling to Italy with the
art department.

She said she is excited about
traveling with other students.

“I’d been to Italy before with
my family, and I loved the art-

work,” Deddens said.

“I wanted the experience of
traveling throughout the country
with my peers.”

Deddens said W&L should
take advantage of abroad pro-
grams in order to “experience
something outside of our campus
bubble.”

“We’re not in an urban area, so
we don’t get to experience a lot
outside our campus community,”
Deddens said.

Another new trip this spring is
to the American West to study the
Lakota Sioux American Indian
tribe.

The trip will be led by religion
professor Harvey Markowitz,
who said the trip will be a unique
opportunity to study the religion,
culture and history of these Na-
tive Americans.

“Indians are so far back in the
consciousness "of Americans,”
Markowitz said.

“The U.S. government has de-
ﬁned them as domestic dependent
sovereigns in this Indian commu-
nity, so it’s like visiting a different
country. You don’t ﬁnd that with
any other ethnic group.”

Markowitz said experiencing
other cultures is essential not only
to students but to all Americans.

“It’s fundamental in terms of
testing and questioning assump-
tions we take for granted,” Mar-
kowitz said. ’

“There’s a lot of fruit to be
gathered by seeing the world.”

Service programs teach students about poverty, inspire young minds to change economic state of nation

By Catherine Carlock
C 0 PY E D ITO R

Red bricks, white columns and
an overwhelming mob of pink po-
los: Welcome to Washington and
Lee University.

With tuition and fees above
$40,000 and a per student endow-
ment of over $200,000, W&L
doesn’t seem like it would be the
venue to study poverty.

Enter Harlan Beckley, former
acting President of W&L. A for-
mer Religion professor with a
doctorate in Christian Theologi-
cal Ethics, Beckley’s main focus
these days is the Shepherd Pov-
erty Program.

It was with Beckley’s insis-
tence and the support of Nancy
and Tom Shepherd that the Pov-
erty Program was founded at
W&L.

The Shepherd Program has
been nationally recognized as one
of the most groundbreaking un-
dergraduate college programs in
the United States. ‘

The Shepherd Program also
works in conjunction with the Na-
bors Service League, which spon-
sors the Nabors Service Day and
numerous other projects.

The popularity of Nabors Ser-
vice Day, the Shepherd Program,
and other service programs like
the Campus Kitchen Project show
that W&L students are ready and
willing to give back to the com-
munity.

Nabors’ next event is Hunger
and Homelessness Awareness
Week.

It is nationally co-sponsored
by the National Coalition for the
Homeless (NCH) and the National
Student Campaign Against Hun-
ger & Homelessness (NSCAHH).

NCH, a not-for-profit program,
sponsors numerous other events
each year.

NSCAHH is another not—for-
proﬁt organization whose goal
is to educate and train students
about hunger and homelessness
in America.

The campaign is also focusing
on a grassroots-level movement
to help put an end to poverty and
hunger.

“We really want to make [the]
Washington and Lee students and
community more aware of the is-
sues that surround them, and this
week in particular about hunger
and homelessness,” NSL general
chair Sonia Siu said.

  

 

“We really want to make [the] Washington and

Lee students and community more aware of the

issues that surround them. ’

Sonia Siu, Nabors Service League General Chair
 

“Nabors Service League is
also seen as a tool through which
Washington and Lee students can
ﬁnd volunteer opportunities,” she
said.

W&L is privileged enough to
have a program on campus that
educates students about the dan-
gerous problems of poverty in the
United States.

This upcoming week, students

I will have the opportunity to be in-

volved with not only Nabors Ser-
vice League, but NCH as well.

The National Hunger and
Homelessness Awareness Week
starts Nov. 13 and will last
through Nov. 17.

NCH co-sponsors the event
exactly one week before Thanks-
giving each year.

The week is dependent on
school and community involve-

ment.

There are no set events or pro-
grams; each separate community
is responsible for coordinating the
event. _

Nabors has several events
throughout the week that will
hopefully raise awareness con-
cerning poverty and hunger.

The ﬁrst of these events is the
Oxfam Hunger Banquet, held
Tuesday, Nov. 14 from 6-8 p.m.
in Evans Dining Hall.

Tickets are $5 and may be
swiped home or purchased at the
door

The Hunger Banquet is a na-
tionally sponsored event that of-
fers an interesting perspective on
hunger throughout the world.

Each person attending the ban-
quet is randomly assigned a role
in a high-income group, a middle-

income group, or a low—income
group.

The high-income group sits
at a table and eats a three-course
meal. The middle-income group
consumes rice and beans while
sitting in chairs. The group rep-
resenting low incomes sits on the
ﬂoor and receives rice and water.

The keynote speaker at this
year’s Oxfam Hunger Banquet
will be Beckley.

On Nov. 16, Nabors will host
an Art Show with a reception and
a Homeless Panel. The panel will
be comprised of two people who
have experienced homelessness
and one staffer on the NCH.

“By going to these events, [ev-
ery person is] going to learn about
ways they can take individual
steps to help some of the people
that are suffering through some of
these issues,” Siu said.

Also this week, the Campus
Kitchen Project is sponsoring a
“5 for 5” event, where W&L stu-
dents can donate to the Project.

For every dollar donated, CKP
will be matched $5. W&L stu-
dents will also receive ﬁve cook-
ies per dollar contributed.

NCH or the NSL do not spon-
sor the event, but it is another op-
portunity to help out CKP.

Men's Cross Country

The Washington and Lee men’s
cross country team ﬁnished
seventh overall at the NCAA
regional championships on
Saturday afternoon at Emory
University. W&L was led by
sophomore Vance Berry, who
ﬁnished 18th overall in a time
of 26: 1 5.3. Sophomore Michael
Welsh and junior Tom Brower
also paced the Generals, ﬁn-
ishing 21st and 33rd overall,
respectively. Berry, Welsh,
and Brower all received all-
regional accolades. Former
W&L star Alex Mahoney, who
transferred to “Rhodes College
this season, won the race in
a time of 25:41.6. Mahoney,
who ran side-by-side with his
former teammates, will next
compete at the NCAA national
championships. The regional
championships was the Gen-
erals’ last race of the season,
ending a very successful 2006
campaign.

Men's Swimming

The Washington and Lee men’s
swimming team continued
its winning ways on Sunday
afternoon when they downed
Gettysburg College by a score
of 153-49. Seniors Kevin Hayes
and Mike Ginder each won a
pair of individual events and
swam on the winning 400 med-
ley relay team. Hayes won the
200 IM and won the 200 breast-
stroke, while Ginder won the
200 free and the 200 back. The
two were joined on the victori-
ous 400 medley relay team by
junior Alex Sweet and freshman
Winston Stagg. The men return
to action on Saturday when they
travel to Franklin & Marshall
for a tri-meet against the host
and Carnegie Mellon. The meet
is set to begin at l p.m.

Women's Swimming

The Washington and Lee wom-
en’s swimming team had one
win and two losses this past
weekend. In ODAC competi-
tion, the Generals defeated
Guilford College 224-32 but
lost to Randolph-Macon 135-
126. On Sunday, the Generals
lost to Gettysburg 134-71. In
the Gettysburg meet, W&L
women had a pair of indi-
vidual winners as sophomore
Lindsey Strachan won the
200 backstroke and freshman
Jenna Worsham won the 200
IM. In the ODAC tri-meet, the
Generals were paced by strong
performances from Worsham,
who captured the 200 free and
the 200 breast, and also was
a member of the winning 200
free relay. Strachan won the
200 back and captured second
in the 500 free, while Susan
Mahoney touched the wall ﬁrst
in the 200 IM and second in the
100 free. The women return to
action on Saturday when they
travel to Franklin & Marshall
for a tri-meet against the host

and Carnegie Mellon.

Men swim to a victory over Gettysburg, while women come up short on Sunday

By Lara Jordan.
STAFF WRITER

The men’s and women’s swim
teams begin their seasons with
a positive outlook, as well as a
strong record, having some of the
fastest individual and relay times
in the nation.

“Individually, Tim McGlaston
has the best 50 free time in the
country, Mike Ginder has the
fastest 200 freestyle time in the
nation, and Paul Crook has been
ranked top ten in the 500 free-
style,” saidsenior Kevin Hayes.

Hayes also said W&L’s team
is swimming signiﬁcantly faster
and is comparable to other “high—
ly regarded teams.”

With these successes, the team
has high expectations for the rest
ofthe season.

“We have set the bar very high
for ourselves this season,” said
senior Mike Ginder. “This year

lV[er1’s soccer loses to Lynchburg

we want to really make a name for
ourselves on the national level.”

In order to accomplish this
goal, Ginder says the team needs
to accomplish two things: have
an undefeated dual meet record
(which means beating Johns Hop-
kins) and ﬁnish in the top-ﬁve at
the NCAA Division III Champi-
onships. ,

The women have similar
goals.

“Our goal as a team is to be
undefeated against the ODAC
teams,” said senior captain Ab-
bie Sauter. “We also want to win
ODACs for the 14th straight year.
Another goal is to break every
single relay record.”

Part of the reason for the teams’
achievements is their workouts.

“This year’s training regimen
has been signiﬁcantly more diffi-
cult than last year, but everyone
has been able to meet the chal-
lenge,” said Hayes. ‘‘It has been

showing with our times.”

One new difference in the
teams’ workouts is the addition of
dryland practices.

According to freshman Jona-
than Giesen, they include more
technical aspects, including lift-
ing.
“We have more intense work-
outs all week long and we are
also doing dryland workouts three
days a week that will help us in
the pool,” said Giesen.

These intensiﬁed practices
make up for their disadvantage of
having only one practice a day.

“We are one of the few teams
in the country that practices only
once a day,” said senior Dave
Croushore. “This all means that
we have to work harder and smart-
er than other teams to achieve the
same results.”

Also, the incoming freshmen
have contributed to the team’s
overall triumph.

“The incoming freshmen have
been an asset to the team from the
outset.” said Hayes. “We have
some very impressive swimmers
strengthening some weak spots
from last year or adding depth to
the lineup. The incoming fresh-
men are keeping the sophomores
and upperclassmen working hard
to keep their positions in the line-
up, which only makes us better
collectively.”

However, the seniors continue
to be the heart of the team.

“The seniors are the lead-
ership core of this team,” said
Croushore. “Not only are three of
the ﬁve seniors strong candidates
for All-America honors, the ﬁve
of us have been with the team
as long as Joel [Shinoﬁeld, head
coach]. We have been through
three years and seen this team
through many different times.
We want to leave this program on
top.”

For the women, the team has
to overcome the disadvantage
of losing 11 members from last

year’s team.

“I’d say maybe the fact that we
are a young team could be viewed

[as a disadvantage],” said Sauter.
“However, we have all grown tre-

mendously this season already,
and I think the fact that the team is
so young and already so good is a
great thing, because next year the
team will still be just as strong, if

not stronger.”

The team also attributes their

success to their coach Shinoﬁeld.

“He knows exactly what it

takes to accomplish our goals

for the end of the season,” said

Ginder. “He spends the time and
effort necessary to make this pro-
gram a success.”

The team competes against

Franklin & Marshall this Satur-
day, Nov. 18, and Sunday, Nov.

Generals ’seas0n comes to an end after a tough I -0 defeat in ODAC semiﬁnals

By Kevin Trempe
STAFF WRITER

For the second time in three
games, the Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team fell victim to a

disappointing defeat at the hands

of a familiar foe.

With a 1-0 loss to Lynchburg
College in the semiﬁnals of the
ODAC Championship, the Gener-
als ﬁnished the season 12-3-2 and
saw their chances at an NCAA
tournament bid disappear.

The defeat came on the heels
of a 2-0 loss to Lynchburg in the
season ﬁnale two weeks ago.

The semiﬁnal game, played at
Roanoke College’s Elizabethtown
Campus, was a defensive struggle
for the ﬁrst 45 minute period, see-
ing no goals from either side.

However, in the 65th minute
of regulation, Lynchburg senior
midﬁelder Casey Zambor broke
through the W&L defensive front
and notched what would become
the game-winning goal.

Thanks in part to two saves
by Lynchburg goalkeeper Marcus
Jordan, the Generals were unable
to respond.

Lynchburg would go on to de-
feat Virginia Wesleyan College in
the ODAC championship game,
eventually falling to North Caro-
lina Wesleyan in the ﬁrst round of
the NCAA Division III Touma-
ment.

W & L learned on last Sunday
that they would not receive an
at-large bid to the NCAA tourna-
ment.

Despite the disappointing ﬁn-

ish, the season was widely viewed
as a success.

The 12-3-2 ﬁnish marked the
Generals’ best record since 2000.
The team began the season unde-
feated for their ﬁrst ten games,
and outscored their opponents 42-
9 for the season.

The 2006 campaign also saw
the 250th win for Head Coach
Rolf Piranian, who garnered much
success in his 315‘ season at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Another mark of success were
the individual accolades acquired
by players.

Two Generals were recently
named to the CoSIDA/ESPN
the Magazine College Division
III Academic All-District Team.
The award, presented to seniors
Scot Pittman and Rhett McCraw,

honors starting athletes who earn
a 3.2 or higher GPA and contrib-
ute signiﬁcantly to their team’s
success. For many, though, the
season meant more than awards,
milestones, and victories.

The successes of this year built
a foundation for teams to come.
Freshman midﬁelder Drew Crow-
ley said that the season “was a
great experience,” and that “a lot
of it should be owed to the leader-
ship on the team.”

“I am extremely excited for
next season and hope to continue
the legacy left behind by the se-
niors of this year’s team. They
will deﬁnitely be missed, and we
will need to ﬁll their shoes next
year.” ‘

The Generals will lose six se-
niors next season, including cap-

tains and leading defensemen J .D.
McDermott, Alex Phillips, and
Scot Pittman.

However, returning players
will include leading goal scorers
Jack Palmer and Josh Dodds, both
expected to make signiﬁcant con-
tributions to the team’s success as
seniors. Also returning will be
starting goalkeeper Ted Sheedy,
who picked up eight shutouts this
season, allowing a total of seven
goals in 15 games.

W & L will advance into the
2007 season with each of their top
ﬁve scorers from this year.

Despite losing starters from
the defense that played a large
role in this season’s victories, all
indications point to continued
success and heightened expecta-
tions for next fall.

Record season led
by senior captains

By Mlke Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

 

After a record run in the
NCAA championships, the
Washington and Lee volleyball
team fell to Stevens Institute of
Techology on Saturday evening
in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA
tournament.

The Generals also beat out
top-seeded NYU in a surprising
upset.

Making it to the Sweet 16
was the best result in the pro-
gram’s history.

Senior captain Ashley Hurt
said, “It was thrilling to make it
to the Sweet 16 for the ﬁrst time
ever, and I am so proud to be a
part of this team. Unfortunate-
ly, the crowd was tough, which
worked for the other team and
against us.”

The crowd was very tough
as the Generals played Stevens
Institute on their home court, as
the men’s soccer team had just
won the regional champion-
ship.

Hurt said, “Everyone was
rowdy. It will be interesting to
see how their team does with-
out their fans.”

The ﬁfth—seed in their sec-
tion of the tournament, the
Generals lost to second-seeded
Stevens Tech 26-30, 38-40, 30-
22, 22-30. , -v - _

In the game, the Generals
were led by junior right side
Jess Hudock’s 13 kills and three
service aces, while sophomore
outside hitter Laura Maurer
made 11 kills. Freshman setter
Kristi Stevens tallied 22 as-
sists, and senior libero Lauren
Edmonson added 16 digs and
three service aces.

The Generals’ biggest victo-
ry of the season came on Friday,
when they defeated top-seeded
and l6th-ranked NYU in a ﬁve-
game battle, 25-30, 30-28, 30-
19, 29-31,15-13.

In the game, Edmonson led
the Generals with a school-
record 11 service aces and a
team-high 25 digs.

Sophomore middle blocker
Kassie Bagley tallied 12 kills
and eight blocks, while Maurer
added ll kills and 16 digs. Hu-
dock racked up nine kills and
18 digs and junior setter Lauren

D
Senior captain Ashley Hurt helped bring together a young team in the Sweet 16

 Bittersweet 16 ends

tournament in Hoboken, NJ. on Saturday. The record season ended against SIT.

Rudolph totaled 29 assists.

Rudolph said, “Beating
_NYU was the biggest accom-
plishment for the W&L volley-
ball program.

“It was an amazing feeling,
coming out and beating the
number one seed in the region
when no one expects you to
win.”

On the season as a whole,
the Generals were aided by
their strong leadership, behind
captains Hurt and Edmonson.

Rudolph praised Hurt, say-
ing, “[She] was amazing this
year, and was often underrated
and her talents weren't ac-
knowledged nearly enough.

“She was out for practically

the whole season last year and
came back to be a huge part of
our tournament run.”

Hurt led the team in kills
against Vassar and blocked sol-
idly against NYU, which played
a huge factor in their victory.

Hurt played through a lot of
pain this year, and yet still came
through to make 227 kills.

The leadership of the Gener-
als played a large role in their
success this season.

Senior libero Lauren Ed-
monson set a school record for
most digs in a season, breaking
her own record.

Hudock added, “With such a
young team it can be hard to set
the right example, but [Edmon-

son and Hurt] really gave us a
great model for playing with
consistency, a positive attitude,
and a lot of heart.”

As Rudolph put it, “These
two ladies were wonderful cap-
tains, fantastic teammates, and
reliable players this_entire sea-
son.”

With their 2006 season over,
the Generals exceeded all ex-
pectations that had been set for
them.

Hudock said, “It was very
surreal to be playing in the
Sweet l6--the concept of it was
really hard to grasp, but it felt
like a huge validation of all the
hard work our team has accom-
plished this season.”

Wrestling
with hunger

Team works to make weight as they
prepare for season with young players

By Joel Poelhuls
8 TA FF W R I TE R

In wrestling, the hunger for
victory must overcome the hun-
ger for food.

Long runs and skipped meals
are necessities for those trying
to make weight requirements,
and an integral part of the sport
is maintaining the body to exact
speciﬁcations of weight and body
fat index.

“Nobody enjoys losing
weight, it’s just something you
have to do,” said freshman Jamie
Goodin.

“Cutting weight is deﬁnitely
the part that makes wrestling dif-
ferent from other sports,” senior
captain Max Courtney said. “It
really teaches you self-disci-
pline.”

The Generals are coming off
their first meet of the season last
week at the Southern Virginia

“We ’re shooting for a

top—four team ﬁnish at

)

conference. ’

MAX COURTNEY, captaln
 

University Knight Open. Court-
ney, juniors Kirk Adamson, An-
thony Boniello, David Shubick,
Erick Gagne and sophomore Rob
Terrin all won in their weight
classes. The team returns nine
starters from last year and has sol-
id players spread throughout the
weight classes rather than one or
two stars. Having depth especial-
ly helps the team in dual meets,
where every point counts.

The Generals are led by Head
Coach Gary Franke, Assistant
Coach Rolf Piranian, and team
captains Courtney and junior Jes-
se Sataloff. Sataloff is currently
recovering from a shoulder inju-
ry, and freshman Zak Colangelo
is prepared to take over the 174-
pound slot until his return.

“Your teammates are really
important, not just for putting up
points for the team, but for push-
ing each other to succeed in the
practice room,” Courtney said.

Last season the team posted a
5-5 record (3-4 in the conference)

and was ranked 13”‘ in the Nation-
al Coaches Wrestling Association
Division III Scholar All-Ameri-
can Team poll.

“Coach Franke deﬁnitely puts
a lot of emphasis on balance be-
tween the mat and the classroom,”
Courtney said.

Franke has coached the wres-
tling team for 34 years, and boasts
three conference titles.

“He’s really mellow and
knowledgeable, which makes it
really easy to learn new things in
practice,” Goodin explained.

Courtney, the lone senior on
the team, described the program’s
development. He said, “When I
was a freshman, we only had four
active guys on the roster. Coach
F ranke went out and recruited and
brought in three solid classes be-
hind us. We’ve gone from being
the -laughingstock of the confer-
ence to being able to ﬁeld a full
team and be competitive. Our
program has come a long way,”
Courtney said.

In wrestling, Washington and
Lee is now a member of the Cen-
tennial Conference rather than the
Old Dominion, because no other
Old Dominion schools have wres-
tling programs.

Most of them dropped wres-
tling as a sport after the Title IX
amendment to the Civil Rights
Act. Title IX, which regulatesthe
equality of men’s and woméri’s
sports, has hit wrestling especial-
ly hard because it is an all-male
sport that does not produce a lot
of revenue.

W & L is the only D-III school
in Virginia to maintain a wres-
tling program. The top competi-
tion in the Centennial Conference
is Ursinus and McDaniel, both of
which were nationally ranked last
year.

“We’re shooting for a top four
team ﬁnish at conference,” Court-
ney said. This would involve four
individuals placing in the touma-
ment. "

The Generals’ next meet will
be away at Ursinus on Saturday,
Nov. 18.

Courtney said despite the hun-
ger and pain, the level of com-
petition makes it all worthwhile.
“There’s no better feeling in the
world than getting your hand
raised after a match, knowing that
you beat that guy.”

Athletes who play nice play Well

Well-mannered athletes show that showboating jerks don ’t have the stats to support their wicked ways

ByAdam Lewls
COLUMNIST

If you have seen any episode
of Sportscenter in the past few
months, then you probably have
noticed that players like Terrell
Owens and Chad Johnson can’t
go a day without an outlandish
comment or a
controversial
act.

And when
the terribly un-
fortunate event
occurs that they
do not make
headlines, they
make sure to
redeem themselves in the eyes of
America by providing our coun-
try with its favorite form of ab-
surd entertainment.

But while T.O. and Ocho Cin-
co are making fools of themselves
and helping their team go .500,

 

Sure, Peyton Manning had a ton to do with

those stats, but guess what? Peyton Manning

is a class act, too...

 

players like Marvin Harrison and
Tiki Barber are not only quietly
compiling league-leading sta-
tistics, but they are leading their
respective teams to division leads
and possibly the Super Bowl.

I don’t know about you, but
I prefer good football over good
smack talk and celebrations.
Now, I’m not denying that the
antics of players like Owens and
Johnson make the game entertain-
ing, but when it comes down to it,
you could have the dance moves
of Emmitt Smith on “Dancing
with the Stars” and still miss the
playoffs.

So essentially it’s up to you.
Do you prefer Chad’s guarantees
for touchdowns and victory or
Marvin’s actual touchdowns and
actual victories? Terrell’s team-
bashing or Tiki’s linebacker-
smashing? Here’s what I think:

Over the past ﬁve seasons, no
one has caught more touchdowns
than Marvin Harrison.

And sure, Peyton Manning
had a ton to do with those stats,
but guess what? Peyton Manning
is a class act, too. If you watch
any Indianapolis Colts game, you
will see touchdowns being scored
at will, and what happens after

Peyton and Marvin dominate de-
fenses?

They pump their ﬁsts, hand
the ball to the ref, give some high
ﬁves, and walk off the ﬁeld to
prepare for their next offensive
lesson. ,

Also, over the last ﬁve seasons,
Tiki Barber leads all players in to-
tal yards from scrimmage. He is
accompanied by Peyton ’s brother,
Eli, who is also very classy. Few
players have had more hype and
media coverage than Eli in the last
couple of years, yet you don’t see
Eli saying: “You can’t stop #10.
No one can stop Uno Cero!”

Instead, he and Tiki simply an-
swer questions as they are asked,
score touchdowns, and write
children’s books (well, that’s just
Tiki). I

And now, let me take this a
ste further, because I know that
someone wants to comment on
the Colts’ and Giants’ inability

to win championships recently.
Let’s look at teams who have won
Super Bowls.

The Pittsburgh Steelers. Hines
Ward and Troy Polamalu, two of
their star players, don’t shine by
wearing Lance Armstrong jerseys
on the training bike because they
hurt their hamstring.

Instead, they play their hearts
out on each down. After either
one of them makes a big play,
they celebrate by making another
play of similar magnitude.

And how about the Patri-
ots? Tom Brady is one of the
most tasteful players in the NFL,
and I’m not just referring to his
looks.

He has an astonishingly suc-
cessful record in the playoffs,
among the sport’s best, but he
doesn’t have to make a chart
of the comerbacks who he has
thrown touchdown passes over.

Rather, he respectably talks to

the media, impressively leads his I

team to victory after victory, and
needless to say, he enviably dated
Tara Reid.

Who are you dating, Chad
Johnson?

In summation, the message is
clear: Chad, you don’t need to
propose marriage to cheerlead-
ers to win. Nor do you have to
translate your jersey number into
Spanish. Terrell, you don’t need
to pop dozens of pills to make it
on TV. But yes, in order to win,
you should stay awake during
team meetings. .

So guys, in January when you
are diligently designing touch-
down celebrations and meticu-
lously constructing methods of
making headlines, use your Santa
Monica/UT Chattanooga educa-
tions to read the headlines that re-
ally matter.

And then, Chad, go do some-
thing about the Mohawk.

The Washington and Lee women’s cross country team start their race at the NCAA regional championships.

Next stop, nationals

Burns and Telfeyan named all—regi0nal and qualzﬁz for NCAA national championship

By Mike Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

11.11.06. That one date has
had an incredible amount of sig-
niﬁcance for the women’s cross
country team for the past three
months.

Nov. 6, 2006 was the date of
the NCAA Regional champion-
ships, held at Emory University
in Atlanta. After an ODAC cham-
pionship, the Washington and Lee
women’s cross country team was
focused on their goal of a strong
performance at regionals.

Sophomore Jackie Burns said,
“We’ve been wearing match-
ing bracelets all season with the
11.11.06 etched in them to keep
us focused on regionals.”

The top seven runners for
the Generals competed this past
weekend, with Burns ﬁnishing
the race ﬁfth overall in a time of
23:13.0. Freshman Kat Telfeyan
ﬁnished ninth overall with a time
of 23:40.7.

With their performances, both
Bums and Telfeyan received
all-region accolades and auto-
matically qualiﬁed to race at the
NCAA Championships.

The Generals were also led by
sophomore Becca Taylor, who ﬁn-
ished 22nd overall, and freshman

Elizabeth Krausnick, who crossed
the ﬁnish line 34th overall. Both
Taylor and Krausnick were also
named to the all-region team for
their performances.

in the team competition, the
Generals ﬁnished in a tie for third
with Mary Washington. After cal-
culations and a tie-breaker, W&L
was victorious over Mary Wash-
ington and was awarded with
third place honors.

Regionals have been the
team’s main focus since the ﬁrst
day of the preseason. The team
hoped to perform better than they
had last season, when the Gener-
als had ﬁnished fourth overall.

Senior captain Jenny Ratzel
said, “We came into the season
focusing on regionals from day
one. We held ourselves to higher
expectations this year. After we
won ODACS the past two years
we thought we were ready to step
it up a level, so we set our eyes on
qualifying for nationals.”

However, the warm Geor-
gia weather proved to be in the
Generals’ favor, as cloudy, warm
conditions were excellent for run-
ning.

“The course was nice and
the weather in Atlanta was a lot
warmer than here, so it was a nice
break,” Telfeyan said.

The Generals have had great
support coming from all direc-
tions this season. “From cookies
to cheering us on at out-of-town
meets, our friends and alums have
committed a lot of time to sup-
porting us,” Ratzel said.

Burns added, “We even had
a surprise visit from our captain
Lindsay Erickson and track coach
Nate Hoey. It’s always comfort-
ing to ﬁnd a familiar face in the
chaos of colors and ponytails.”

The team also had a close bond
to each other, as Coach Kris Hoey
planned many team activities to
promote enthusiasm throughout
the season.

“I think that our team is very
close and it helped that we did
a lot of things together,” Kraus-
nick said, “We had secret buddies
and we went to many team din-
ners which made us have a strong
bond.”

For a season that featured an
ODAC championship as well as a
third place ﬁnish at regionals, the
Generals have a lot to be proud
of.

“We had two people instantly
qualify for nationals, which is a
huge deal. Everyone was really
pumped about the race and tried
their hardest,” freshman Mary
Frances Weatherly said.

Most importantly, the team
placed third overall, which goes
to show its depth and strength,
from the ﬁrst person to cross the
ﬁnish line to the last.

“The girls really put them-
selves on the line for this race.”
Burns said, “You could deﬁnitely
see it in their ﬁnishes.”

While this race was the last
meet of the season for many of
the girls, other will carry on to na-
tionals and many will compete in
indoor or outdoor track.

“We’re the bomb-dot-com and
it’s been a great senior season,”
Ratzel said. “The entire team put
so much time, sweat and heart
into this season. We wouldn’t
have been nearly as successful if
we didn’t have every single per-
son on this team. We’re not only
teammates but we’re friends and
after spending so much time to-
gether.”

Burns and Telfeyan will next
compete at the NCAA national
championships, which will be
held on Saturday, November 17 at
12:00 pm at the Voice of America
Park in West Chester, Ohio.

Burns said, “We’re both very
excited for nationals, but not quite
sure what to expect--only that it
will be a very talented and hum-
bling ﬁeld.”

Soccer scores to Sweet 16

The Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team advanced
to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA
tournament with a thrilling 1-0
win over Maryville College on
Sunday night.

The 24th-ranked

Score Generals set a pro-
W &L 1 gram. record for

, wins in a season, as
MarYV1”e 0 their victory over

Maryville was their
18th of the season. This will also
be only the second time in pro-
gram history that the Generals
have advanced to the Sweet 16.

The ﬁrst half of the Maryville
game was a score battle, but just
45 seconds into the second half,
junior forward Martha Caulkins
found the back of the net off an
assist from senior captain Anne
Wiltshire. It was Caulkins’ tenth
goal of the season and Wiltshire’s

sixth assist.

The goal would be all that the
Generals needed to secure the vic-
tory, as sophomore Kiki Moreo
posted the Generals 19th shut-out
of the season.

Caulkins said, “We tried to use
the same strategy that we used in
the past. We came out hard from
the very beginning.”

The Generals dominated play,
only allowing one shot on goal.
While their offense made the dif-
ference in the score, their defense
was also stellar, as W&L out-shot
their opponents 20-1.

While the Generals played in
Maryville, Tenn. for the weekend,
their fans did not forget about
them. Many parents attended the
game to show their support for
the team, and there was even fac-
ulty support as Professor Kenneth
Lambert and Associate Professor
Dick Grefe made the trip to Ten-
nessee.

After a week of hard practices

and even a 6:30 a.m. practice on
Friday before making their trip to
Tennessee, the Generals worked
hard for their victories this past
weekend.

In their ﬁrst round game, the
Generals crushed Meredith Col-
lege in dominant fashion, 6-0.

The Generals were led by
sophomore forward Anne Van
Devender, who notched a hat
trick. In doing so, Van Devender
broke the W&L single season
record for points scored, as the
goals brought her season total to
57. She also tied a school record
with 23 goals on the season.

Also scoring for the Gener-
als was forward Wiltshire, who
scored off an assist from senior
forward Sarah Helms. Shana 01t-
mans scored the ﬁfth goal of the
game for the Generals off an as-
sist from midﬁelder Kate Corr.
Sophomore defender Marissa
Van Brunt also ‘added a goal for
the Generals off a free kick from

nearly 30 yards out with minutes
left in the game.

Moreo and senior goalkeeper
Emily Binns both played in goal
for the Generals.

The Generals relied on their
strong defense and dominant
offense, since it carried them
through their season. .

Caulkins described, “Our
backs are awesome. Our defense
shut them down.”

The Generals will next take
on Washington University in St.
Louis. The location of the game
is still to be determined. Wash U
is the top seeded team in the Gen-
erals’ section of the draw, but the
Generals are going to be up to the
task.

Caulkins said, “We’ll all be
nervous. Everyone is so ﬁred up.
We’re so excited that we feel like
we can take on anybody if we
work hard enough. We’re playing
really well, and hopefully we can
keep that up.”
