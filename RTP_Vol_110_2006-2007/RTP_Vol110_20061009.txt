Inaugural activities centerpiece of homecoming weekend

By Sacha Raab
STAFF WRITER

omecoming

weekend is two

weeks away, and

already the stu-
dents, University Security,
and inhabitants of Lexington
are beginning to feel the ex-
citement and tension of this
major event.

This year the weekend is
even more important, as it is
combined with President Ken-
neth Ruscio’s inauguration.

Lexington is expecting
3.000 to 4,000 out-of-town
gJests.and 150 VIP guests,
including many representa-
tives from other colleges and

universities.

This inﬂux of visitors is
causing concerns for the Uni-
versity Security, who will be
employing all of their staff on
that Saturday.

The University already
struggles with parking ar-
rangements, and the popular-
ity of the weekend will surely
cause complications.

University Security is
planning on using the parking
areas that are typically used
for major events; however,
they will most likelynot be
sufficient.

Students typically seem to
be excited mostly for Home-
coming parties and events.
According to sophomore Kel-

si Robinson, it is the ﬁrst big
date weekend at Washington
and Lee, though it really only
involves a few cocktail par-
ties and maybe a date.

“It always, causes some
nerves, especially among the
girls who have no control
over the situation, consider-
ing the frats are the ones with
all of the events and parties,”
Robinson said.

Junior Kelly Will agrees
that the students are generally
looking forward to the parties
and all of the visitors coming
into Lexington from out of
town, especially alumni who
have recently graduated.

“I don’t really know what
kind of stir the President’s

Inauguration is making, but
people seem to like Ruscio a
lot, so I’m sure people are in-
terested to see the beginning
of his era,” Will said.
According to Will, Home-
coming is an important week-
end for the school because of
all the returning alumni and
fraternity rush events.

Homecoming weekend
should be a great success this
year.

Combined with Ruscio’s
inauguration, the city of Lex-
ington and the University will
beneﬁt from its weekend in
the spotlight with alumni, col-
legiate representatives, and
plenty of other supporters of
the school.

Ring-Tum Phi: What has been
your favorite part of the ﬁrst
few months on the job, espe-

cially the month since school
started?

Ruscio: I think talking with stu-
dents and talking with alumni.
Just hearing once again all the

stories about Washington and
Lee — what they value about
W&L. The characteristics
that are meaningful to them.
Also seeing the diversity of
experiences they convey.

Phi: What surprised you
about the new job?

Ruscio: Nothing really. There
was no particular issue or
problem that surprised me. I
think every college president
is surprised by the volume
and range of issues you have
to deal with.

Workers lay down
sod and sidewalks
during construction

By Dane Davis
STAFF WRITER

In a temporary yet expensive
project, thousands of dollars in
grass outside the Elrod Com-
mons has been torn up and re-
placed with sod.

It may surprise some, but
this isn’t the first time the uni-
versity has landscaped the Elrod
Commons’ courtyard. Randolph
Hare, Project Manager of the
construction and landscaping
around Elrod Commons, said,
“The area between the Co—op
and Commons was reseeded
after utility connections for the
Co—op were completed.”

Then why is money being
spent to re-sod the area?

Hare said, “The results were
less than satisfactory in part be-
cause of the poor quality of the
soil. In fact, the area from Reid
Hall to Graham-Lees Dorm
was in need of improvement.
The corners of the green spac-
es were wom from pedestrian
trafﬁc, there were drainage and
landscaping issues dating back
to the construction of Commons
that needed to be addressed."

Hare said the university
consulted with a landscaping
ﬁrm before deciding to re-sod
the entire area to make asthetic
improvements. He said the re-
sodding is an interim step in a
comprehensive _ improvement
of the area from Reid Hall to
Washington Street. Hare said
the project’s biggest changes
will happen during the summer
of 2007.

That means all work hap-
pening in the Elrod Commons’

Phi: What are you looking for-
ward to about the inauguration?

Ruscio: It’s going to be a celebra-
tion of W&L. It’s not about me.
It’s about where we are and where
we’re headed.

It’s exciting to me that all differ-
ent members of the community
are involved.

It’s a chance to think hard about
W&L.

Phi: Can we have a preview of
your speech?

Ruscio: The general theme is that
it’ll be about not just liberal arts
education, but a Washington and
Lee liberal arts education. I’ll
talk about some of the disctinc-
tive qualities of W&L that make
us W&L.

New sod, fresh bricks, and temporary sidewalks are changing the view in front of Graham-Lees. The project will be finished in August 2007.

square is provisional until 2007.
According to Facilities Man-
agement, the “ﬁnal courtyard
project will not begin until after
graduation, June 2007 and will
be completed by August 2007.”
This means that the sod and
concrete sidewalks will eventu-
ally be replaced.

Phi: Do you think students will
be interested and present at the
speech?

Ruscio: What I’ve told many stu-
dents is just come and have fun.
Come casually, sit on the lawn,
and watch what goes on. We
want it to not be a serious, overly
formal event, and of course there
will be lunch on the lawn after-
ward. We hope students will par-
ticipate.

Phi: If you could change one thing
right away, what would it be?

Ruscio: One thing I consider es-
pecially important, this year is to
consider the teacher—scholar mod-
el. This is more intangible than
some of the other goals.

I want to engage faculty in a dis-
cussion about what it is to be on

When asked, Hare wouldn’t
say how much the construction
costs.

Students may have wel-
comed the improvements more
if they weren’t temporary ﬁxes.
The fact that all of this money
is being spent on sidewalks and
grass that will eventually be torn

faculty at a student-centered lib-
eral arts college. That will lay
groundwork for some other things
we consider.

Phi: What are your goals for the
rest of the year?

Ruscio: A variety of things. We
have to be very determined to de-
velop ﬁnancial aid resources for
students. To continue to attract
the best and brightest students,
we must make sure cost isn’t a
deterrent.

We also have to recruit and main-
tain the best faculty and staff.
There are also important physical
projects, starting with the Colon-
nande. We’ll be making decisions
about speciﬁcs and design.
Students and faculty should look
back 80 years from now and thank
us for making wise decisions to
preserve the Colonnade.

“As long as they make the side-

Homeless for a weekend

Nine students will .%‘])eI7(.f par’! of reading days living among the homeless on the streets of Washington, D. C.

By Sarah Kientz
STAFF WRITER

Most Washington and Lee
students look forward to reading
days as a break from what can be
a long and stressful start of the
school year. Many go home; oth-
ers relax and catch up on lronie
work and sleep. Most. l]O\VC\.'tIl.
do not spend their time living in
poverty.

According to sophomore Mi»
caela Coffey, nine W&L students
plan on taking the Urban Plunge,
a program through the National
Coalition for the Homeless. Vol-
unteers spend 48 hours living like
the homeless on the streets of
large cities. W&L students will be
taking the Plunge in Washington.
D.C., over the long weekend.

“You’re living on the streets in
D.C. as a homeless person with-
out the conveniences that we en-
joy here,” Coffey said. “No cell
phone, no credit card. no money
at all.”

Coffey, the Alternative Breaks
chair for Nabors Service League,
said that W&L students will be
split into three groups. During the
day, the groups will be on their
own and experience what it is like
to be homeless.

“They encourage you to pan-
handle for a couple of hours."
Coffey said. “Well, you have to.
or else you’re not going to lrzive
anything to eat.”

Soplioinore /\lden Wicker,
who will be participating in the
Plunge. said that although it might
be eiiibarrassing. she"'s looking
for'\vard to learning front experi-
ences like panhandling.

“*1 know it will be the most
huniiliirting thing I will have ever
clone to actually beg for money,“
Wicl<ci' .‘~'1.lltl. “lloprsfully being
hungry and seeing how people
who are like myself treat me
i‘«,'liL‘,ll l look ratty will teach me
something about myself.”

liiiiior Woodrow Friend is also
participating in the Urban Plunge.
Friend said the manual that the
National (‘oalitiori for the Home-
less gives to participants encour-
ages them to face the hardships
of looking for a job without the
conveniences of a car or a phone
niuriber.

“When reading the Urban
Plunge handbook. l found a note
encouraging others to apply for
fast food jobs. Mention that you
don‘t have a home or a phone
number but that you are willing to
check back every day. Those lines
caught my attention." Friend said.
“I am looking forward to trying to
find ajob as a plunger.”

The National Coalition for the
Homeless also encourages partici-
pants to “eiigagc with other home-
less people“ by playing cards or

just talking so that students can

"try to delve in as deep as [they]
can iiitr.‘ that whole world." Cof-

fey said.

“We’ll be able to experience
what it’s really like to not have
anything to do," Coffey said.
“Like the homeless. wc‘ll be
walking all day and not ending up
anywhere."

Senior Chris Tittle. iiivolvcd
in the Shepherd Poverty Program.
said he is looking forwarrl to r;oll--
necting with the people he meets
on the streets.

“I am much more excited than
scared about this because l have
worked with homeless people in
D.C., and for the most part. they
are normal people facing a variety
of adverse circumstances.” Tittle
said. “There certainly is an ele-
ment of danger and risk involved.
but that is what makes this sncli a
real experience.”

ln the evenings. the students
will spend the nights as a group
of nine with a guide. The group’s
guide will be John llarrison. a
homeless man who has been
working with the National Coali-
tion for the Homeless for several
years leading groups on the Ur-
ban Plunge. The group will either
sleep on the street or in a shelter.
Coffey said.

“The National (‘oalition
doesn’t really want college stu-
dents to take up beds in shelters.
but the group and the guide will
make the decision together de-
pending on the eirciimstariecs."
Coffey said.

Coffey added that the National
Coalition for the Homeless “al-
most requires peoplc to take shifts
so someone is awake at all times"
ifthe group sleeps on the street.

Although the experience seems
like it might be dangerous, Coffey
said the National Coalition for the
Homeless has been running the
program for over 20 years and
have never had any participant be
in danger.

Aubrey Shinofield. W&L”s
Service Learning Coordinator,
said she is conﬁdent in the group’s
safety during their Urban Plunge.

"I The National Coalition has]
done this program for such a long
time. and groups come back on
an annual basis.” Shinofreld said.
“I feel comfortable working with
them and they’ve assured a safe
CXp€l‘lt‘.ltCC for our students."

Sliinofield said that the number
of students who signed up for the
Urban Plunge exceeded her ex-
pectations. but she is excited for
them to step out of their molds.

“lt’s obviously going to be a
very intense experience.” Shine-
ﬁclcl said. “This isn”t going to be
a break at all—— it may not even
be fun. They’rc going to experi-
ence things that are going to make
them think. they’re not going to
get a lot ofsleep. but I’m proud of
the people that are going. Tlieyie
choosing to experience some-
thing they could never learn in the
clas.<ii.ioiri bttt that is absolutely

taking the plunge:

Students will:

- spend 48 hours living on the streets of D.C.
- sleep on the streets Oi‘ in a homeless shelter.

- panhandle and apply for jobs.

- be led by a homeless guide.

part of our education."

Coffey said she’s looking for-
ward to the experience. and that
she thinks the other eight students
will take a lot away from it.

“Its meant to be an emotional
challenge,” Coffey said. "but l
hope we gain a better understand-
ing of this issue that’s a big prob-
lem in our nation. especially our
nations capital. which is so close
to us."

Friend also said he thinks it is
important for W&L students to
learn how the less fortunate live.

“I believe that experiences like
these are very important for W&L
students.” Friend said. “For many
students. including myself. we
have been fortunate. being born
into wealthy and loving families.
Many others have not been so for-
tunate. lt will be a good experi-
ence to get out of my element and
interact with those people."

Although Wicker said that
“some people think [sires] crazy“
for going on the Urban Plunge.
she’s looking forward to finding
out l]0\\' litiiiielcss people live.

\

“I don‘t think it’s important for
everyone [to experience the Ur-
ban Plunge]. but it would help for
students who have never experi-
enced want and will be launched
directly into a afﬂuent life to live
on the other side of the tracks for
a bit." Wicker said. “I’m already
learning things. I always assumed
that homeless people were addict-
ed to drugs, or mentally retarded
or something. but I’m finding out
that isn’t always true. Hopefully
l‘ll come back with some valu-
able knowledge.”

In addition to realizing the
hardships of others, Tittle said he
feels he‘ll be able to gain personal
growth through the experience.

‘"1 think it is essential for per-
sonal growth to put yourself in
foreign and often uncomfortable
situations to find out who you re-
ally are and what you are capable
of." Tittle said. “It will hopefully
give me some insight not only
into the plight of the homeless,
but also into my own perspective
on life and what I want to accom-
plish.“

Lexington Police Chief Steve
Crowder says student parties are
staying quiet this fall.

Crowder’s department lras
only received a few noise t,Z0lll--

He said the department is-
sued only 11 court summons last
year for noise complaints but said
some of those may not have been
student parties.

During the first month of
school Lexington police otl'ieer:~;
issued a few written warnings but
did not write tickets for any stu-
dents.

Residents of Rockbridge
Country have been lobbying the
county Board of Supervisors to
crack down on large parties held
outside of city limits. County
residents have been especially
upset with the raucous parties
held at Windfall Hill and the Pole
Houses.

Crowder said. “In a perfect world

Crowder said his department
worked to find a happy medium
between the students’ parties and
what their neighbors are willin,i_.2

Mike Young. Director of(‘am-

avoided some of the couritr'y‘.«:
problems by building a good sys
tent for noise issues.

“Part of the r,lifl'c~i'er1«.‘r: is that

the city has set up a lot more struc-

Young said the current city
ordinance has been in place for
nearly 20 years. allowing students
to familiari7.e themselves with the
city‘s standards and regulations.

Because student houses inside
city limits are usually modest res-
idences with small yards. it is rare
for city parties to draw the large
crowds that flock to Windfall Hill
or the Pole Houses.

Mimi Elrod, the Director of
W&L’s Summer Scholars pro-
gram and a member ofthc Lex ing-
ton City (founcil. says she never
hears from angry neighbors.

“I think people who move in
close to the university anticipate
some noise," lilrod said.

ljlrod said the Housing Direc-
tors of most fraternities make air
effort to get to know their neigh-
bors and solve concerns without
involving the police. the also

“Problems don’t go on and on
because the police are out and
about,” lilrod said. “Its not that
the police don‘t have anything
better to do. but it just doesn’t
take long to get places in town.”

While residents in the county
continue to battle with W&L stu-
dents over large parties, relation-
ships between students and their
neighbors remain placid inside
city limits.

l€lrod thinks that students who
live in town do a better job of get-
ring to know their neighbors.

“You‘re more patient when
you know people.” Elrod said.

The steady pressure to party

Believe it or not, you can have a fun and exciting night life without getting roaring drunk every single night

By Grace Andrews
c o L u M N I sr

Today’s topic is the party scene
at Washington and Lee, or at least
the pressure to party. Once again,
I must place a disclaimer here: If
any of what I say describes and/or

» offends you,
that isn’t my
goal. My
goal is sim-
ply to share
a few of my
opinions.

The oth-
er day, I was
talking to a
friend who
doesn’t go
out much.

The ﬁrst time she attended
a W&L party, she saw people
she knew hanging upside down,
drinking from garbage cans and
getting wasted.

These students were people
that she had thought were “mod-
erate drinkers,” or something of
the sort.

My friend, who shall remain
nameless, remembers random
people chanting her name and try-
ing to get her to take shots.

She was smart, strong, and

[insert adjective here] enough
to walk away, but some of her
friends were not.

They drank because they
wanted to be cool. After witness-
ing these “activities,” my friend
rarely goes out. Her story inspired
me to write this article. I thought
to myself, “how many people
here have been changed because
of the socialpressures to party
and to drink?”

Let’s start with a few of my
own personal stories. A few weeks
ago, I went to a party and saw
some friends who were “drunk.”
I use that term loosely because
one of them was pretending to be
drunk so that his friends wouldn’t
give him a hard time about not
drinking.

I had another friend tell me
recently that while at a party, one
of her drunken friends tried to co-
erce them repeatedly and almost
belligerently into drinking.

They even went so far as to use
the “good friend” excuse. I know
you’ve heard it before, because it
starts with, “You would if
you were a ‘good friend.”’

Now, what is the common
thread in these stories? Ding, ding,
ding, that’s right, all these people
were asked to drink. If you really

Last time I checked, a good time didn’t involve

a visit to the health center; making out with a

total stranger and then not recognizing them

the next day on the Colonnade, or losing every-

thing valuable at a Pole House.

need the non-drinkers to drink,
have water as a beverage option
for beer pong, or take alcohol free
Kool-Aid shots. However, if this
were to happen, the cases of H20
poisoning or sugar shock would
skyrocket.

Let me give a few stats to sup-
port my thoughts. In September
alone, there were 30 alcohol ar-
rests in Lexington.

This was only through Sept.
20; this was seven more than the
23 average of all alcohol related
arrest per month for the past four
years (‘O2-‘06).

When all the drinking inci-
dents were averaged out from
since 2002, we surpassed the me-
dian score repeatedly. Granted,
these averages aren’t just us, but
all of Lexington.

Although I wonder exactly
how much partying the retired
population of LexVegas is partici-
pating in.

I’m not going to lie; I some-
times don’t go out because I just
don’t want to deal with offensive-
ly drunk students.

I have no desire to carry a
babbling conversation or pretend
to listen to a drunken account of
some “hilarious” event that is not
funny because my BAC is lower
than 0.1.

I’m even guilty of going to a
party in my study clothes (I like to
call it my “hobo chic”) staying for
ten minutes and leaving. '

The only reason I do this is
because some of my friends will
laugh at me and even worry be-
cause they don’t think I’m going

out enough.

It’s not that I don’t want to
have fun, but since I don’t drink,
there seems to be nothing for me
to do at a party.

Now, I would go if great mu-
sic and even better dancing was
guaranteed, but since I ﬁnd some
of the music hard to dance to and
refuse to watch or accept drunken
teetering and tottering as dancing,
I just don’t go. I know that I’m not
the only one who feels this way.

Sometimes the party scene
here thoroughly confuses and
scares me. I have a hard time un-
derstanding why people get so
drunk that they can’t remember
anything they did the night be-
fore, or even their names.

Last time I checked, a good
time didn’t involve a visit to the
health center, losing everything
valuable at a Pole House, making
out with a total stranger and then
not recognizing them the next day
on the Colonnade.

It seems like to me that if peo-
ple drink for a “buzz,” or to feel
“loose,” a moderate amount of
alcohol could do the job.

The problem is when people
drink their own body weight in
ﬂuid ounces.

When I see people doing this,
I just have an urge in my heart to

give them watered-down apple
juice. '

Honestly, they are so drunk
they wouldn’t know or taste the
difference.

Iknow that right about now,
some people are reading and roll-
ing their eyes all around their head
at what I have to say and have no
intention of ever reading what I
write again (don’t worry, the co-
medic articles will be retuming
after reading days!).

Once again my goal isn’t to of-
fend anyone.

If you actively drink and even
get totally wasted, that’s your
business, but please be a “good
friend” and respect the choice that
others have made.

I’m not judging you, and I per-
sonally don’t care if you drink.

Seriously, who cares if you
destroy brain cells, do things
you will regret, or even kill your
liver?

I just don’t want to be at a party
and repeatedly badgered to drink
or to hear that my friends are, or
that some students aren’t going
out because they don’t want to be
forced to drink by those that they
care about, aka friends.

«Remember that friends don’t
ask other friends to drink when
they don’t want to.

Looking to lose
on election day

In this anti-incumbent election, neither party wants to win

By Abel S. Delgado
COLUM mm

The closer we get to Election
Day 2006, the more apparent it
becomes that both parties are
determined to lose.

As ridiculous as this sounds,
all signs point to a Democratic
party too afraid to take power
and a Republican party that
doesn’t want it anymore.

Let’s start with the Demo-
crats. In 2004 they could have
chosen John Edwards to run for
president.

Edwards was young, charis-
matic, relatively inexperienced
(meaning not a Washington
bureaucrat), relatively moder-
ate and able to cross party lines,
and, most importantly, south-
ern.

Basically, he ﬁt the same
mold that Bill Clinton did in
1992 and George W. Bush did in
2000, a formula proven to win
time and again.

Instead the Democrats chose
John Kerry, an old school “intel—
lectual liberal” from the North-
east. Name the last Northeastern
“intellectual liberal” president.
It might take you a while to go
that far back.

The Democrats had other
choices. If they wanted to beat
Bush at his own game, they
could have chosen Joe Lieber-
man, who is more Republican
than Bush and more pro—Bush
than many Republicans are.

.He would have gotten votes
from Republicans and from
people who refuse to vote Re-

publican, the two biggest voting
groups in the country.

If they actually wanted to
stand for something, they could
have chosen Howard Dean and
gone screaming into battle.

I’m not saying this would
have meant victory, but at least
it would have made things more
interesting.

Why would the Democrats
want to lose? Apparently they
had a crystal ball.

Just look at all that’s hap-
pened since November 2004:
Iraq has gotten worse, Afghani-
stan has taken a few steps back,
gas prices are so high people are
actually walking a few blocks to
get places, the world is worried
that birds are going to sneeze on
us and kill us off and the larg-
est natural disaster in American
history happened.

Of course, this is the presi-
dent’s fault entirely. It always
15.

So the crystal ball told the
Democrats to lose in 2004 to
receive no blame for things no
one is able to control anyway.
I ﬁgure the Democrats had the
same crystal ball right before
the Great Depression.

Now it seems the Republi-
cans have found their own crys-
tal ball. Things are probably go-
ing to get a lot worse. Why else
would the Republicans start a
huge ﬁght with each other based
on something decided in Gene-
va a long time ago?

Why else would they hide a
suspected pedophile Congress-
man until right before the elec-
tions?

Why else would they
choose Katherine Harris to
run for Senate in Florida?
Does anyone like Katherine
Harris? Does Katherine Har-
ris even like Katherine Har-
ris?-

The Republicans look
well on their way to losing
these mid—term elections.
They might just want to keep
traditions alive.

Second terms for presi-
dents are not supposed to go
badly; they’re supposed to go
horribly (i.e. Watergate, Iran-
Contra, Monica Lewinsky).

And the ruling party is not
supposed to win mid-term
elections, because people get
bored of seeing the same let-
ter behind everyone’s name.

So maybe the Repub-
licans want to lose just to
keep political history easy
enough for our textbooks to
simplify.

If the Republicans don’t
manage to lose this election,
it proves two things.

First, people will stub-
bornly vote for their party
regardless of what their party
does or doesn’t do.

Second, there are way too
many people like Katherine
Harris in the Democratic
Party}  ‘ ' ' """ 

Still don’t believe the
parties want to lose? Just
remember, whoever loses
in 2006 can just criticize
the winners in 2008 and not
actually stand for anything.
Isn’t that what party politics
is all about?

Press priorities
miss the mark

Election coverage focused on the wrong issues

Cowboy boots versus com-
bat boots.

Is that really the most im-

tics today?

After reading local and na-
tional coverage of the Senate
race between George Allen
and Jim Webb, that’s certainly
how it seems.

We could care less about
the shoe choices of Allen and

The uninspired press corps

than consider his plans for

Even Tim Russert, the
moderator of NBC’s “Meet
the Press,” couldn’t steer a
September debate on his show
away from character issues.

Russert asked the candi-
dates about Iraq and terrorism

And politicians wonder
why young voters don’t go to
the polls.

Why did the press focus on
Kerry’s swift-boat service and
Bush’s time in the National
Guard?

Because it was an easy
story guaranteed to sell news-
papers or attract television
viewers.

Because it was juicy and
full of gossip.

CBS News, in its rush to
scoop the competition, relied
on forged documents to ques-
tion Bush’s guard service.

Not only was the story ir-
relevant, it was inaccurate.

Enough overkill on juicy
political scandals. It doesn’t
matter if your business de-
partment thinks that scandal
sells well.

Journalists should serve
their audiences, not the al-
mighty dollar.

Abandon petty scandals
and focus on real issues.

Thank God for the ACLU

The ACLU says it speaks for the people, but does it really do what it says?

By Chris Tutor
COLUMNIST

Thank God for the American
Civil Liberties Union. Seriously,
America needs the ACLU. The
United States Constitution needs
the ACLU.

Without fail, the ACLU de-
fends the freedom of speech.
Without fail, it ﬁghts violations of
the Fourth Amendment. Without
fail, it protects the rights of the
accused. The list continues.

However, there is a problem.
Despite its many admirable ac-
tions, the ACLU often distorts the
Constitution and disregards the
intentions of the Framers.

Although the ACLU’s mission
is to “preserve...First Amend-
ment rights...the right to equal
protection...the right to due pro-
cess...and the right to privacy,”
it constantly contradicts itself re-
garding the constitutional role of
the government and often exalts
the judiciary over the electorate.

The ACLU seems to suffer
from a crisis of identity concem-
ing what the government can and
cannot do, particularly at the fed-
eral and state level.

Whatever your opinion on
each of these issues, the ACLU
displays a frustrating and alarm-
ing lack of consistency and rea-
son.

The ACLU maintains that the
government cannot criminalize
the sale of child pornography
(see the 1982 Supreme Court case
New York vs. Ferber).

According to the ACLU, the
government cannot criminalize
drugs. The government cannot

ban partial-birth abortion. Also,
the government cannot allow
a moment of silence in public
schools (Wallace vs. Jaﬁ°ree).

Simultaneously, the govem-
ment can force doctors, health
workers, hospitals and insurance
companies to perform or subsi-
dize abortions.

According to the ACLU’s
website, the government should
also order private employers and
schools to set “goals and timeta-
bles” for the hiring of under-rep-
resented groups.

Also, the government can
force private employers to cover
contraceptives and birth control
in health insurance programs.

Absurdly, the government can
also demand that the Boy Scouts
allow homosexuals to serve as
scout leaders.

The ACLU’s support for the
legal concept of corporate per-
sonhood further complicates its
contradictory position. Corporate
leaders maintain that corporations
possess many of the same consti-
tutional rights guaranteed to U.S.
citizens.

Therefore, the ACLU cannot
simultaneously justify an individ-
ual right to privacy and exempt a
corporate one.

To be consistent, the ACLU
cannot just pick and choose.

Where does the ACLU draw
the line regarding the proper in-
terference of the government?
How far does the right to privacy
extend? The ACLU does not pro-
vide a credible answer, only a
contradiction.

Obviously, there is only one
common factor behind the AC-

T he ACLU implements that agenda by consis-

tently undermining the voters. In effect, it uses

the judiciary as an alternate legislator Does it

take its issues to the ballot or the legislature?

LU’s contradictory positions on
the role of the government in
these matters: The ACLU uses
that role only when it promotes
its liberal agenda.

There is no constitutional stan-
dard. There is no logic. There is
only an agenda.

The ACLU implements that
agenda by consistently undermin-
ing the voters. In effect, it uses the
judiciary as an alternate legislator.
Does it take its issues to the ballot
or the legislature?

Rarely, because it would most
likely lose. Instead, the ACLU
ﬁles countless lawsuits to utilize
the courts to impose its ideology
on the electorate.

Would the Founding Fathers of
the United States agree with this
method? For the ACLU, it is ob-
viously a practical one, but does it
follow the spirit of the Constitu-
tion and our Republic?

On October 15, 1788, James
Madison, the principal architect
of the Constitution, wrote “as the
courts are generally the last in
making the decisions [on laws],
it results to them, by refusing or
not refusing to execute a law, to
stamp it with its ﬁnal character.
This makes the Judiciary depar-

ment paramount in fact to the Leg-
islature, which was never intended,
and can never be proper.”

According to Madison, judicial
usurpation is not the way our Re-
public was meant to operate.

The power of the people invest-
ed in their representative assem-
blies was intended to be greater
than that of unelected officials
serving as judges.

As I wrote at the beginning of
this article, the ACLU is good for
America.

Courageously and consistently,
it defends the constitutional rights
of such groups as the North Ameri-
can Man/Boy Love Association,
neo-Nazis and even the Ku Klux
Klan.

America needs the ACLU.
However, it is not fulﬁlling its mis-
sion.

It does not maintain a ratio-
nal, constitutional position on the
role of the government. It uses the
courts to implement its agenda, not
the people.

James Madison would not be
a card-carrying member of the
ACLU.

Neither would Jefferson. Nei-
ther would Hamilton. Neither am
I.

  Dragging out tolerance

2" he campus celebrates National Coming Out Week with mixed opinions

By Queenie Wong
STAFF wrmra

The most widely attended
event of National Coming Out
Week (NCOW), the drag show,
was cancelled Friday due to rainy
weather.

“The rain site wasn’t ideal and
we would have to cancel certain
services that we had planned for
so we just decided to cancel the
entire event,” said Gay-Straight
Alliance president Stephanie
Wiechmann.

Both the GSA and its law
school counterpart, OUTLaw,
sponsored the Third Annual Drag
Show.

The show, originally sched-
uled on the law school patio,
would have been moved to class-
room B, a more enclosed environ-
ment that lacked a stage. Based
on the ﬁgures last year, said
Wiechmann, the GSA and OUT-
Law were expecting a fairly large
audience that wouldn’t have ﬁt.

In the past, the drag show has
been held in the Moot Courtroom,
but because of renovations, it was
not available this year.

In addition, the serving of al-
cohol posed a problem. Accord-
ing to Wiechmann, the majority
of law school parties involve al-
cohol because the students are of
legal drinking age. The beer gar-
den that could have been outside
could not be set up inside a class-
room due to security problems.

Although no deﬁnite date has“

been announced, Wiechmann
said that the drag show will occur
sometime this year as a singular
event.

“The goal is to support those
who make a decision to come
out... and to let [Washington and
Lee] students know that there
are gay, lesbian, bisexual and
transgender students here,” said
Wiechmann. “Washington and

Lee is not immune to the outside
world and different alternative
lifestyles.”

Prior to the drag show, the
GSA and OUTLaw held other
events throughout the week to
promote coming out.

These events included pass-
ing out Skittles, hanging National
Coming Out Week posters, show-
ing the movie “Latter Days,”
urging students to vote, inviting
author Christian de la Huerta to
speak about his experiences in the
religious community, and holding
an ice cream social.

Reactions to NCOW have
been positive, for the most part,
Wiechmann said, praising the in-
volvement of the freshmen class.
“We’ve had a lot more freshmen
than usual at these events.”

However, not all students had
the same reaction. Arturo Roa, a
conservative Catholic and a fresh-
man at W&L, said, “The whole
concept of National Coming Out
Week revolves around the idea
that the homosexual lifestyle is
not a choice.

“It’s genetically predetermined
and it is irrevocable. I believe this
position is fallacious.

“To say homosexuality is ge-
netically determined is to say that
other positions such as alcohol-
ism are predetermined,” he said.
“If that were the case why not
have a National Alcoholic Com-
ing Out Week?”

The nature of celebrating gay
pride has also posed "questions
about its effectiveness in promot-
ing tolerance.

De la Huerta, author of the
critically acclaimed book “Com-
ing Out Spiritually,” agreed that a
drag show may have negative and
positive effects.

“Not only does it perpetuate
stereotypes, but it also puts wom-
en down,” said de la Huerta, who
graduated from Tulane University

Why should gay, lesbian, bi[sexual] and trans-

gender people mimic heterosexuals? After all,

they are notheterosexuals.

TED DELANEY, history professor

with a degree in psychology.

De la Huerta referred to Cali-
fornia governor Arnold Schwar-
zenegger’s comment about “girly
men” in the 2004 election as a
prime example.

“The reality is that the major-
ity of gay and lesbian Americans
don’t dress or look like that,” he
said I

Nevertheless, by pushing the
boundaries, organizations such as
the GSA are forcing others to deal
with these sensitive issues. Ac-
cording to de la Huerta, getting
the community to more readily
accept gays and lesbians requires
a multi-pronged approach.

The most effective method is
for gays and lesbians to come out
and reclaim their moral standing,
he said.

As for promoting tolerance
on the campus, de la Huerta had
three words to say: “Support the
GSA.”

Dr. Kirk Luder of University
Counseling also said he acknowl-
edged the possibility of a drag
show perpetuating gay and les-
bian stereotypes. ' i

M“ on‘ the ‘other 'lia'i1‘d, because it '

is a “deﬁant rejection of the so-
cial norm,” Luder said that this
extremity could be useful to the
gay and lesbian community, espe-
cially in a predominately conser-
vative campus like W&L.

Luder also cited conformity
and conventional thinking as ma-
jor problems facing the student
body.

Education is crucial in promot-

ing tolerance, Luder said.

Last spring term, W&L of-
fered History 353: Gay and Les-
bian Life in the 20th Century-
United States. History professor
Ted Delaney will teach the course
for a second time this spring.

“The course is important as a
means of breaking down stereo-
types and teaching the political
and social history of queer people
in 20th century United States,”
he said. “I hope the students
come away from the course with
the understanding that no stereo-
types apply. Gay men can either
be very masculine or very effem-
inate or variations of both.”

In regard to more extreme
forms of expression such as drag
shows and the Gay Pride Pa-
rade, Delaney emphasized the
thought-provoking questions
they bring up. A

“[It] challenges those of us to
look on and ask: Why does this
offend me? Why should gay, les-
bian, bi[sexual] and transgender
people mimic heterosexuals? Af-

ter all, they are not heterosexu-

als.”

Wiechmann agreed. ‘‘[The
drag show] is a way to step out-
side yourself for a night,” she
said, “to dress as the other gender
and to have fun in a safe environ-
ment without any inhibition.”

“I don’t think it perpetuates
the stereotype because the drag
culture is a part of the GLBT
[gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans-
gender] lifestyle that W&L stu-

dents never get to see,” she said.

Captured in
the limelight

NPR, History Channel call professors

By Julie Von Sternberg
STAFF wnman

National Public Radio and
the History Channel recently
invited two Washington and Lee
professors as guest speakers on
their broadcasts.

Classics professor Dr. Miri-
am Carlisle and Law professor,
Mark Drumbl were recognized
by the stations for their expertise
and intellectual energy.

As a classics professor, Carl-
isle has extensive knowledge of
Latin, Latin Literature and Ro-
man history, or what she likes to
call “ancient stutf.” She did not
gain this wisdom solely from the
classroom but also from person-
al experience.

“Her extensive background,
not only in her studies, but in her
travels and the people she’s met
really comes out in her teach-

. ing,” said senior Matt Krieg.

On campus, Carlisle is known
for having a laid-back attitude
and a genuine interest in her stu-
dents. Senior Matt Miller is one
of many students who appreci-
ate Carlisle’s personable teach-
ing style.

“She’s always willing to talk
to students about topics rang-
ing from translation problems to
questions of their future or life in
general,” said Miller.

In the summer of 2005, Car-
lisle exhibited the same enthusi-
asm when she agreed to appear
on the History Channel docu-
mentary “Sahara.” The show
provided an in-depth picture of
the development of the desert,
beginning during prehistoric
times.

During a three hour inter-
view, Carlisle provided detailed
descriptions of the wars fought
between Rome and Carthage,
the life of Roman soldiers and
the persecution of Christians.

“It was fun... surprisingly
fun,” recalls Carlisle.

Students who missed the doc-
umentary last year were excited
to hear of its re-showing. “I will
deﬁnitely be watching it on the
16th in hopes of gleaning some
more nuggets of wisdom from
Professor Carlisle,” said Clas-
sics major Matthew Loar.

Like Carlisle, professor Drum-
bl is well known on the W&L
campus for his enthusiasm and
teaching skills.

“With his passion, he brings
to W&L a contagious interest in
international affairs, wonderful
expertise and teaching ability, and
top notch specialists in the ﬁeld,”
says law student Nick Devereux.

In the classroom, Drumbl
uses the Socratic method to cre-
ate engaging discussions. “When
the class is tired and not partici-
pating, he gets visibly upset. He
starts yelling, ‘Come on people,
you have to have an opinion!’”
said Devereux.

In his book “Atrocity, Pun-
ishment, and International Law,”
Drumbl focuses on the connec-
tion between crimes against hu-
manity and the implementation of
international legal orders. In addi-
tion to international criminal law,
Drumbl’s teachings and research
include global environmental
governance, transitional justice,
contracts and comparative law.

Drumbl recently had the op-
portunity to share his opinions
on'an interesting issue of intema-
tional law. On Sept. 28, Drumbl
was invited to speak on National
Public Radio’s show “All Things
Considered,” where he ‘analyzed
the Nuremburg war crime trials

when military tribunals sentenced "

political, military and economi-
cal leaders of Nazi Germany. The
trials concluded 40 years earlier
from the date of his broadcast,

In his address, Drumbl criti-
cized the rulings at Nuremburg.
“Certainly there is much to cel-
ebrate in the Nuremburg judg-
ment,” he said. “However, tri-
als alone will not reconstruct a
shattered society. Trials will not
thwart the hatreds that give rise to
Sectarianism. Trials do not create
socioeconomic stability.”

These words provide just a hint
of the passion and excitement that
Drumbl exudes in the class room.

Both Drumbl and Carlisle
have had positive inﬂuences on
their students. Their discussions
on NPR provided the listening
public a rare opportunity to also
experience the educators’ knowl-
edge in and enthusiasm for their
respective subjects.

THE RING-TUM PHI - 9

SI10l'lS

 

 

Women's Cross-
Country

The women dominated the
Virginia State Division II-III
Meet on Saturday, placing
ﬁrst out of 11 teams. Wash-
ington and Lee was led by
sophomore Jackie Burns,
freshman Katherine Telfeyan
and sophomore Becca Taylor,
who earned fourth, ﬁfth and
sixth places respectively. Also
in the top ten were freshmen
Dorothy Todd and Mary Fran-
cis Weatherly. The women
face Gettysburg college on the
road next Saturday.

Football

The Generals shut out Catho-
lic this weekend 28-0. Junior
Mark Snoddy caught two
interceptions, helping to keep
the Cardinals from advanc-
ing more than 100 yards

the whole game. Freshman
quarterback RJ Vamer com-
pleted 17 of 28 passes, and
Stuart Sitterson and Colton
Ward contributed 316 yards
combined. The team hosts
Hampden-Sydney on Saturday
at l p.m.

Men’s Soccer

After tying Virginia Military
Institute on Wednesday, the
Generals put another one
away on Saturday versus
Guilford College, winning
2-0. The men’s record now
sits at 10-0 for the ﬁrst time
in W&L history. Scoring for
the Generals were junior mid-
ﬁelder Josh Dodds and junior
forward Jack Palmer. The men
look to continue this streak
when they face Eastern Men-
nonite University on Wednes-

V day on the road.

Volleyball ,
The volleyball team did not
drop a game this week. Early
in the week, the Generals
defeated Lynchburg College
and Ferrum College 3-0, 3-0.
This weekend, they traveled to
Danville, Va. and beat all four
teams. The only tight match
was against Averett on Friday.
The Generals face Sweetbriar

there,” junior Natalie Day said.
“A lot of the upperclassmen were
really nervous, but I think she
appreciates that the value to the
team is more than just the play-
ing ability. There are a lot of team
leaders in the junior and senior
classes.”

After tryouts, Rankin decid-
ed to keep 20 on the roster. The
team also picked up new assistant
coach Eric Ishida. According to
Tabb, he has been a crucial asset
to the team.

“Our new assistant coach is
fabulous,” she said. “He’s done
a really good job at preparing us
for this weekend. He’s done a lot
to restructure our doubles, which
is good, because it is our weak
area.”

Tabb also said the team dy-
namic is forming extremely well.

“Everyone’s really positive
and motivating,” she said. “They
all really want to be out there.
That’s the big difference between
D-III and D-I—it’s not you’re job~
you want to be out there.”

For the ﬁrst time, the Generals
competed against Division I op-
ponents last weekend at the Vir-
ginia Tech Invitational.

“I think it’ll give us a good
chance to test ourselves in situ-
ations where we will be play-
ing better players,” junior Leah
Weston said.

“It’s a good opportunity to pre-
pare us for the Spring-to get us in
the mentality for harder matches
that are going to make us compete
our best and really have the will
to stay out there.”

if the team had a good enough
chance that season.

Despite the vested-interest ap-
proach that coaches are encour-
aged to take with their athletes,
O’Connell did note there is Uni-
versity policing about drinking
within athletics.

Said O’Connell, “We do have
a three-strike policy for our teams
that mirrors the University’s
three-strike policy for the frater-
nities and other organizations.”

On the ﬁrst strike that is as-
sessed against any given athletic
team, the players involved are
suspended.

This weekend in doubles play,
freshman Lauren Caire and Tabb
won the ‘B’ doubles ﬁnal when
they were pitted against team-
mates Weston and junior Ginny
Wortham in the ﬁnal round. Caire
and Tabb defeated the pair 8-6.

“We deﬁnitely try to take it
seriously, but we were both try-
ing to win the ﬂight of doubles,”
Wortham said.

Wortham also noted that the
match was more laid back and
that all four had fun.

Junior Rebecca Timmis and
partner, freshman Katie Bouret
were defeated in the ﬁrst round
by a team from the University of
Mary Washington 8-1.

The pair of sophomore Tori
Christmas and junior Kelly Will
met Caire and Tabb in the semi-
ﬁnal round and fell 8-0.

In singles competition, Timmis
won the D ﬂight 6-2, 6-4 against
teammate Weston. Wortham and
Will advanced to the semi-ﬁnals
in the C ﬂight but were both de-
feated by VT opponents.

Caire was eliminated by VT’s
Bethan James in the quarterﬁnals
of the C ﬂight, and Tabb was de-
feated in the ﬁrst round of the B

ﬂight by VT’s Natalie Kretzer.
Bouret and Christmas were both
eliminated by Mary Washington
competitors in the quarterﬁnals of
the D ﬂight.

“I think we were deﬁnitely
prepared,” Wortham said. “I think
we went in there with the mindset
that we had nothing to lose and
everything to prove.”

This tournament marks the end
of the fall season for women’s
tennis. They will return again in
the Spring with renewed energy.

Last Spring, the team beat Em-
ory 6-3 in the regular season.

“Last year, I liked playing
them duringthe season, because
our win against them gave us a lot
of conﬁdence going into Nation-
als,” Weston said.

“At the same time, it’s nice to
wait to play them, because that
way going into it, we won’t know
what to expect.”

Tabb said she looks forward to

the potential challenge.

“It’s always a nice indicator
of where we are in the season.
It won’t happen for a long time,
so we’ll have a chance to prac-
tice and improve before we get
there.”

establish rules

When a second strike is given,
the team will lose its off-season
practices.

So, for example, if the football
team was assessed two strikes, it
would not be allowed to practice
in the spring.

On the third strike, the team
forfeits their next season.

“Also,” said O’Connell, “one
important thing to remember
about this three-strike policy is
that it isn’t just effective over the
academic year, but for a 365-day
period, so it’s a little bit more se-
rious to get any strikes.”

Overall, however, there is an
over-arching consensus that alco-

Sports Beat team analyzes the effects of bad athletes

Andy: Hi, hello and welcome
to OutLoud, your weekly sound
off on the World of Sports, from
the Monday Night Sports Beat
team.

Just last week another report
surfaced that linked several more
baseball players to using perfor-
mance-enhancing drugs. And
still none of the major sports
have implemented strict enough
drug testing standards to crack
down on players that try to cheat
their way to success.

Is it the pressure of winning
and making millions of dollars
that drive athletes to try to ﬁnd
the shortcut and the easy way to
win? When did athletics become
all about winning? Sports serve
as a venue in which individuals
can learn life lessons.

Sports can teach a wide range
of lessons that can apply directly
to everyday life.

When athletes try to cheat their
way to success, they set up role-
model situation where children
believe that it is OK to bend or
break the rules.

When kids take shortcuts they
miss valuable lessons such as
learning how to work with others,
playing by the rules, and playing
the game the right way. These lost,
valuable lessons will haunt our so-
ciety by creating a world in which
it is OK to take the easy way out,
break the rules and along the way
avoid serious punishment.

Professional leagues and ath-
letes need to realize their role in
society and eliminate activities
that can set a negative example

for young athletes everywhere.
The leagues must severely crack
down on athletes that break rules,
making sure that the costs of us-
ing perforrnance-enhancing drugs
are so high that athletes will not
even consider using any banned
substances.

Athletes need to get back to
promoting work ethic and that
through work ethic anything can
be achieved. All is not lost. With
a few minor reforms both by the
leagues and the athletes, they can
regain the majesty that has domi-
nated American culture for the
past 100 years.

Neil: Steroids huh? Let the
rant begin. Well, the story with
steroids is this.... steroids exist,
they suck, they have no place in
sports, or in life really. That’s a

speciﬁcally isn’t——as O’Connell
put it~“enough of a problem to
be an issue.”

Said O’Connell, “My experi-
ence from talking to coaches and
administrators from other colleges
is that W&L is really no different
in terms of alcohol consumption
from other schools, we’ve just
been pegged with the reputation
as a party school.”

“Now, for us to think that
there’s any team that is in no way
involved in the consumption of
alcohol would be naive, but we’re
really no different from other
schools and other colleges across
the nation in terms of alcohol
consumption by athletes.”

This past week, Tennes-
see Titans’ defensive tackle
. Albert Haynesworth was
suspended ﬁve games by
the NFL alter he stomped
on the face of Dallas Cow-
boys’ center Andre Gurode.
It looked as if Haynesworth
‘was practicing the Polo ritual
of replacing the divots on the
field, except that the divot
was Gurode’s bare (non-hel-
meted) face. Gurode needed
 stitches to replaces his
own facial divot, and is cur-
rently deciding whether or
not to press charges.

Actions like this have
been taking place more and
more in sports over the last
few years. It was only a few
months ago that France’s
Zinedine Zidane seemed to
confuse Ita1y’s Marco Ma-
terazzi’s chest for the ball as
he headed him to the ground.
And it was only a few years
ago that Ron Artest, Jermaine
O’Neal and other Pacerplay-
ers brought “Celebrity Death
Match” to the Palace at Au-
burn Hills in Detroit. More-
over, you may remember just
two months after the Pacers-
Pistons brawl, the Canucks’
Todd Bertuzzi punched the
Avalanche’s Steve Moore
in the face before smashing
his head into the ice, causing
spinal fractures, 21 concus-
sion and other injuries.

These acts, all of which
occurred during the game,

fact. And I think that’s about all
that needs to be discussed about
steroids. Why must we keep talk-
ing about steroids, but do nothing
about it? Ban people who test
positive and that’s that.

I thinkwe need to start focusing
on bigger problems, like sports-
manship. Albert Haynesworth
can stomp on a guy’s bare face
and only get suspended 5 games?
How about Marcus Vick?

Or how about the Ohio State
player this year who intention-
ally twisted Michigan receiver
Steve Breaston’s leg at the end of
a play?

While some of these players
were punished for what they did,
others were not. This trend of vi-
olence is a much bigger problem
in sports than steroids is.

Or at least I think everyone
in the media, and the world, has
beaten the steroids story to death.

Let’s try and clean up our
sports on all levels. We can’t fo-
cus only on steroids, as we have
done so far. Haynesworth should
have been kicked out for the year.
Case closed.

I shouldn’t even mention ste-
roids, or poor sportsmanship,
when I can write about good
sportsmanship.

Baseball lost one of its ambas-
sadors when Buck O’Neil passed
away. A Negro Leagues legend,
as a player and coach, O’Neil in-
explicably fell short of making the
Baseball Hall of Fame. Unfortu-
nately O’Neil never got a chance
to play in the major leagues, but
did make his mark as a coach and
scout, discovering players such as
Lou Brock and Ernie Banks.

Steroids (and problems in gen-
eral) get the big coverage, and
maybe deservedly so (but not this
much).

The good people and good sto-
ries often get brushed aside. At
the end of the day, sports meant
to be for fun. As Andy wrote last
week, sports can be such a uniting
force.

With sports having so much
positive potential, why has it
turned into such a dividing and
negative force? I’m not com-
pletely sure‘ how things can be
ﬁxed  I wish I knew. What I
do know is that everyone is re-
sponsible. Players, fans, coaches,
everybody.

We cannot just sit back and ac-
cept rampant steroid use. We can-
not sit back and accept such ugly
breaches of sportsmanship.

These are the issues in sports
these days,and professional ath-
letes who are some of the most
visible people out there. Do your
part and help bring back sports to
the purists. Please.

Women record eleventh straight
shutout versus Catholic Saturday

By Lara Jordan
STAFF wmnzn

The women’s soccer team saw
huge success both offensively and
defensively in its shutout over
Catholic University on Sunday,
3-0.

With three goals in the ﬁrst
half from freshman midﬁelder
Roz Klann, junior forward Mar-
tha Caulkins and senior forward
Anne Wiltshire, the second half
saw little action.

The Generals
5¢0|'9 had 16 shots to
W &L 3 Catholic’s four.

Sophomore
Catholico goalkeeper Kiki

Moreo was heavily
protected by Washington and Lee
defense, only needing to making
one save.

“The defense played really
well against Catholic today,”
sophomore defender Sara Foster
Reeves said.

“We were challenged at the
back. They were a strong team.
We were deﬁnitely up to the chal-
lenge.”

Last Wednesday, the Generals
tied ODAC competition Guilford
College in double overtime.

W&L clearly dominated the
ﬁeld outshooting Guilford 30-5.

Guilford’s goalkeeper, Veroni-
ca Zych, recorded 16 saves, while
Moreo posted three.

Moreo attributes the team’s
successes to its chemistry, dedi-
cation and depth.

“Our team gets along really
well,” said Moreo. “We are all
friends, and we all joke around

constantly.”

“However, at the end of the
day, we are all willing to ﬁght for
each other to get a good result.”

The team is currently ranked
eighteenth in the nation with a
9-0-2 record after its victory over
Catholic on Saturday.

The Catholic game marked the
team’s eleventh straight shutout.

The defense has been a critical
part of the team’s success.

“I feel like we have a really
strong defense this year, and we
have come together really well at
the back,” Reeves said.

“We have a fairly young de-
fense. We’ve played really well
together so far.”

The team has several goals
this season, including winning in
ODAC competition.

“I think if the team continues
playing as well as we have been
playing, we have a great shot at
going to the NCAA’s [this year],”
Reeves said.

The team is hoping to accom-
plish this goal and is having a
strong start to the season.

“Since the seniors have been
freshmen, we haven’t won the
ODAC, so winning the ODAC is
a big and immediate goal,” said
junior Martha Caulkins.

“We have set ourselves up in
a good position winning opening
weekend, and we haven’t let any
goals in yet.”

The dedication of each team
member also contributes to the
strong record.

Alcohol in sports

Athletic director: coach claim consumption not pressing issue

By Cody Beauchamp
8 TA FF W R I TE R

The general consensus among
many athletes, coaches and ad-
ministrators is that drinking
among student athletes at Wash-
ington and Lee is no more of a
problem than alcohol consump-
tion for non-athletic students is.

One athlete, who requested
anonymity due to the sensitive
nature of the issue, said, “Yeah,
most athletes here drink—who
doesn’t? I think it’s a little mis-
leading to separate athletes from
the rest of the student body and
say ‘they drink a lot,’ because
there are plenty of non-athletes
who drink too.”

Echoing the sentiments of the
student, Interim Athletic Director
Chuck O’Connell said, “I don’t
think [drinking is] any more of an
issue for the athletic teams than it
is for the rest of the college.”

“Of course it goes on. For me
to sit here and say that none of
our athletes drink would be na-
'1've,” said O’Connell. But he said
he had a hard time thinking of any
incident where athletes showed up

to practice or a competition under
the inﬂuence of alcohol.

However, “athletes showing
up to practice while being affect-
ed by hangovers has occurred.”

Overall, O’Connell doesn’t
believe that alcohol has had a
detrimental effect on the competi-
tiveness of W&L’s athletic teams.

“Our coaches attempt to work
with our teams to address the way
that the athlete’s decisions off the
ﬁeld affect their performance on
the ﬁeld,” O’Connell said.

He explained that each in-
dividual team has rules about
alcohol consumption set by the
coach of that team and his or her
athletes.

“It’s really up to the individual
coaches to work with their ath-
letes to set the rules for the team,
and that’s where we’ll see rules
like the 48-hour abstention rule
that some teams will set for them-
selves,” he said. “Any violations
of those team rules are addressed
by the coaches. It’s really up to
them as to how they respond to
the violations.”

O’Connell said that allow-
ing the students to work with the

also had the effect of letting the
students “buy into” the rules.

One coach, who wished to re-
main anonymous so as to not im-
plicate his team’s members in any
illicit activity, said that the ap-
proach to setting the rules works
well in a way that allows the team
to be responsible in the way they
drink.

“We could sit here as coaches
and set hard-and-fast abstention
rules,” said the coach, “but this
way works out a whole lot better.
The way we do it now, the stu-
dents get to work with us to set
their own rules about when they
and their teammates can drink. It

rules they agreed upon.”

It also allowed the students to
determine how serious they want-
ed to take their sport, the coach
noted.

“It does vary from sport to
sport and from season to season,”
said O’Connell. “If your season is
going really well, you may want
to abstain and place winning and
having a good season over going
out to the parties.”

them for so long.

At this moment, however, the
team is putting Nationals out of
its mind. exploring its strategy
and its dynamic, and taking each
match as it comes.

“We’1'e deﬁnitely focusing on
our own games and ourselves,"
sophomore Katie Tabb said.

“We want to peak at the right
time. We deﬁnitely aren’t looking

According to teammates, try-
