The tragic shootings at Virginia
Tech over Washington and Lee’s spring
break produced shock and horror
throughout the Lexington community.

Amidst the confusion of the trage-
dy’s aftermath, faculty, students, and
staff were left to deal with their grief
and wonder if such an event could hap-
pen here.

With most students off campus,
the administration nonetheless acted
quickly in response to the news. Imme-
diately following the shootings, Presi-
dent Ruscio contacted Tech ofﬁcials to
offer condolences and whatever sup-
port W&L could provide.

Law students organized a vigil that
same day outside Lee Chapel, and
members of the University commu-
nity awoke the next morning to ﬁnd
an e-mail from Ruscio announcing a
campus-wide moment of silence com-
memorating the victims.

University ofﬁcials expressed
“shock” at the brutality displayed so
close to home. Said William C. “Burr”
Datz, Coordinator of Religious Life, “it
was hard to believe that this was taking
place in a place where I had walked.”

Datz immediately began prepara-‘
tions for a vigil the following week that
would allow undergraduate students to
“grieve and support one another” as
well as to express solidarity with the

For Dean of Students Dawn Wat-
kins, an alumna of Virginia Tech’s
undergraduate and Masters programs,
the tragedy had a distinctly personal
dimension. In Italy when the story
broke, she struggled to get the latest
news coming out of Blacksburg. Upon
returning home, she found a Red Cross
emergency response center set up in
the Roanoke airport. The airport was
decorated in Tech’s colors.

“It was at that point that I realized it
was considered a national tragedy. . . it’s
comforting to know how much people
care, and it also makes the pain much
more real,” she said. “I’m still trying to
get my mind around it.”

The tragedy has sparked renewed
examination of current campus securi-
ty plans. The administration maintains
a Campus Crisis Management Plan
(CCMP), which Dean Watkins says is
always being revisited.

“It’s a living document,” she said.

There are subsections of the plan
dealing with speciﬁc subject areas,
such as student affairs. Portions of

the plan are reﬂected in other univer-

sity programs such as Dorm Counselor
training.

According to a statement issued by
Ruscio, the CCMP was recently revised
and updated with a speciﬁc section
dealing with “Violent Persons on Cam-

people safe, it takes the community. Never think you ’re

bothering the police by reporting suspicious behavior ”

Steve crowder
Lexlngton Chlef of Pollce

pus.” It stresses communication as key
during any crisis. There are plans to
install a siren system that would project
a lockdown alert throughout campus.

In a lockdown, Director of Public
Safety Mike Young advises all students,
faculty, and staff to “remain where they
are...until ordered to move by public
safety personnel. We are developing a
warning plan for all community mem-
bers that will provide guidance on what
to do in these cases.” Discussions about
a possible text-messaging system that
would alert students to a crisis are also
ongoing.

All parties agree that crisis response
cannot be the whole of the community’s
efforts. Police Chief Steve Crowder
stated that there is “absolutely nothing”
the police can do to prevent a shooter
from inﬂicting harm on the campus.
Burr Datz concurred, saying that “it
could happen anywhere; if somebody
methodically wants to inﬂict damage,
and they’re that sick, ill, diseased~

- ment.

they’re going to do it.”

Chief Crowder instead called for
vigilance, communication, and cooper-
ation among the members of the com-
munity—including students, campus
security, VMI, townspeople, and the
Lexington policehto identify trouble-
some signs early. “It takes more than
the police department to keep people
safe,” he said. “It takes the community.
Never think you’re bothering the police
by reporting suspicious behavior.”

Campus security maintains a close
relationship with the police depart-
W&L’s Public Safety Depart-
ment is automatically notiﬁed about all
911 calls from the campus. They police
and public safety departments also
have a shared radio frequency.

Administrators praise W&L’s com-
munity as exactly the kind of safety net
needed to protect the campus. “I doubt
[something like Virginia Tech] would
happen here. . .we’ve got this culture of
care, we’re small enough, we appear to

nity...where we watch out for one an-
other. Whether it’s Peer Counselors or
Dorm Counselors or faculty or house
directors or chapter presidents or cam-
pus ministry, those are all areas we all
stay tapped into to try to understand if
someone needs help.” ‘ _

“It’s important for us all to remem-
ber that we are a community that needs
to look out for one another, that we
need to support one another, and if we
think a friend—or even not a friend—is
in trouble, then we all need to be doing
something about it,” she added.

Watkins also ensures the commu-
nity that the university has the tools
necessary to deal with students that are
a potential threat to self or others. Un-
der current educational privacy laws,
administrators are allowed to involve
parents in cases dealing with such anti-
social behavior. “We do so and contin-
ue to do so,” she remarked, in the “rare
instances” it is necessary.

The trials of the past week had little
effect on this year ’s Accepted Students’
Day; record-breaking crowds expressed
conﬁdence in the W&L community
to provide a safe environment for the
Class of 2011.

Dean Watkins received just a single
question all day long regarding W&L’s
security preparations in the wake of the
tragedy.

~ Vigil honors victims of Tech tragedy

W&L community pauses to reﬂect on the lives lost in shootings at Virginia Tech

By Grace Wang
‘} STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee students, faculty,
. and administration gathered last Monday
ii to remember the victims of the shooting
i at Virginia Tech
As attendants ﬁled in, sporting Vir-
. ginia Tech gear and orange and maroon
ribbons, Burr Datz and Logan Gibson
played soothing, moumful music.

Dean Watkins, an alumna of Tech,
started the evening with a recount of
where she was when she ﬁrst heard the
tragic news, a story that left her in tears.

“W As the vigil progressed, this emotional
intensity ampliﬁed as President Ruscio, a
VMI cadet, local religious leaders, and
others, shared their reactions from the
tragedy.

Several of the speakers led prayers
with the group and honored the deceased

 

by name.

Gradually, the Cohen Amphitheater
was illuminated by hundreds of candles,
each blowing in the wind and held in

. W&L’s support for Tech.

Student at the candlelight vigil came
for varying reasons. Many have friends
or high school classmates who now go to
school at Virginia Tech.

Stephanie Marks, a freshman from
Frederick, Md., was not personally af-
fected by the shooting but had friends
at Tech whose friends were injured or
killed.

She felt compelled to attend the vigil,
explaining that it was “a day of support.”

“It’s absolutely shocking to think that
this would occur on a college campus. ,”
said Marks. “For a college student, it re-
ally hits close to home.”

Annie Blakey, a freshman from Nor-
folk, Va., has a best friend from high

school currently at Tech.

She recalls watching the news at home
during spring break.

Blakey said, “I have a lot of friends at
Tech, and I felt helpless at home because
I couldn’t do anything to help them.”

Blakey also added that attending the

W&L vigil helped her come to terms with
the shooting and gave her a sense of clo-
sure. .
She said, “Going to the vigil helped
me to face it on my own and not from
the perspective of being concerned about
friends.”

Casidhe Horan, a sophomore from
Richmond, Va., has attended everything
from elementary, middle, and high school
to basketball games to Girl Scouts with
one of her best friends, Allison Cook.

A Tech sophomore, Cook suffered
three gunshot wounds the day of the
shooting.

When the shootings began, Cook was
in French class in Norris Hall, the aca-
demic building that suffered the greatest
number of casualties.

The students’ attempt to blockade the
door failed as the gunman pushed his
way into the classroom and began ﬁring
at the ﬁrst row.

Amazingly, with three bullets lodged
into her right side, Allison was only one
of three or four individuals to walk out of
the class of 22.

Horan said, ‘‘I truly believe it was
nothing short of .a miracle in the midst of
evil that she survived.”

Horan attended a vigil in Richmond
during spring break, but she admits that
she needed W&L’s candlelight vigil.

She said, “I needed to hug all of my
friends here because I found out ﬁrst-
hand that day that only a few millimeters
can be the difference between life and

death. I found out how easy it can be to
lose someone you love forever. . .I needed
to talk about it in Lexington. I needed to
grieve at my university.”

Unfortunately, Rosemary Kelley, a
freshman from West Springﬁeld, Va., was
a high school classmate, teammate, and
close friend of one of the victims, Leslie
Sherman.

Kelley and Sherman ran cross-coun-
try and track for three years together and
were both members of the French Club,
History Honor Society, and National
Honor Society.

In attending the vigil, Kelley wanted
to remember her good friend Leslie.

She said, “Leslie has had a tremendous
impact on my life. . .she was charismatic,
smiling, ﬁmny, respectful, intelligent,
and genuine. The loss of such a beautiful
and valued life is difficult, and by going
to the vigil, I wanted to remember her.”

Community heals wounds

The sense of togetherness can help prevent another tragedy

By Abel Delgado
C 0 L U M N I ST

An old, ignorant man makes a ra-
cially insensitive comment. A has-
been pop star exits rehab with a new
wig. The paternity test for the child
of a deceased drug addict is released
in the Bahamas. This is what we call
news.

Then, a deranged 23-year-old Eng-
lish major spills the blood of 33, in-
cluding his own, on the Virginia Tech
campus. This is what we call tragedy.

Suddenly, we put everything in
perspective. Suddenly, we once again
realize how fragile life is. Suddenly,
we’re horriﬁed, angry, and asking
questions.

The events on the morning of April

Games extend beyond

Work hard, play hard ethic involves t

By Danlel Mesonero Kromand
COLU M msr

In my search for an ever-larger
group of victims of my rambling ego, I
have decided to use this excellent plat-
form to write about various theorists.
This week’s topic is the work of Roger
Caillois: Man, Play and Games.

In the book, Caillois analyzes the
four basic elements of play and how
the games are inﬂuenced by the sur-
rounding society. The four basic types
are competition (agon), chance (alea),
simulation (mimicry), and vertigo
(ilinx). ,,__ ._ ..

Most g_a,1,;.;;,s_; include several of
these four. I In football, for example,
the teams are subject to rules that en-
sure fair competition (same amount of
players on the ﬁeld), but at the same
time, luck plays a role (the way the
ball bounces).

Other games involve simulation,
such as playing doctor, where there is
no way to win (although this particular
one does have a desirable outcome. . .).
The ﬁnal type of play is vertigo,

tions than answers. Everything from
the violence in our movies, to our gun
laws, to our policy on foreign nationals
in American universities, will be ques-
tioned, re-examined, and criticized.

Fingers will be pointed at officials
from Virginia Tech for not advising
students or ‘asking police for help im-
mediately after the dorm attack. The
counselors and professors who no-
ticed Cho Seung-Hui’s violent writ-
ing will also take some unnecessary
blame. The students who saw him as a
loner will wonder why they didn’t do
enough.

None of this will help.

None of this will bring back the 32
innocent victims. No media coverage
in the world will stop this from hap-
pening again.

That’s the truly frightening part.

where the participants momentarily
lose bodily control and feel a thrill of
helplessness, as experienced on roller
coasters.

Caillois examines how most mod-
em societies mainly focus on games
of chance and competition, and only
rarely allow the two other forms.

Primitive societies, on the other
hand, use games of simulation and
vertigo in order to connect with the
gods and to retell myths and legends.

Caillois tracks the chance in games
to Athens in ancient Greece, where the
rationalistic democracy could not al-
low its citizens to indulge in the fren-
zied festivals of the Dionysus cult.

So instead, games that promoted
the individual body and mind were
preferred and included in the

No matter what we do, nothing will
make a repeat of that horriﬁc morning
an impossibility.

We can and should restrict access
to guns for those who pose a threat to
others, but the disgustingly determined
individuals like this one will still ﬁnd
a way.

We cannot put airport-like security
in every dorm building, classroom,
and library in the United States. For
that matter, we can’t put it in every
movie theater and park either.

We cannot constantly watch over
everyone who is on anti-depressants,
considered to have “stalker” tenden-
cies, or writes violent plays. All the
dots connect when it’s too late and
that’s part of the problem.

So what can we do?

What type of society do we live in

In the entire Western world, sports
are all individualized, even team
sports.

You are never a better player than
the abilities your body have and the
strategies that your mind can come up
with.

For the professional player, society
treats him as an individual, but what
about the fans?

They all trade in a part of their per-
sonality by putting on the team colors,
and thereby gain a share in the com-
munal identity and whole.

For a brief moment the audience
is ﬁlled with a feeling of connectivity
and belonging, so even though they
are watching a game, they themselves
participate in a game of simulation.

e power

when something like this is apparently
inevitable? What on earth can we pos-
sibly do about the Cho Seung-Huis
of the world? All we can do is come
together, mourn, grieve, and hopefully
unite in a community, in a society,
where tragedies like this just do not
happen.

We should have every conversation
about the aspects of our society that
we need to change, the aspects that
this terror has brought to light.

But if there is one thing we cannot
afford to lose after this tragedy, it is
the feeling of community we always
have after something like this hap-
pens. Unfortunately, that feeling is the
ﬁrst thing we lose after a while.

That community may be the one

thing that can save us from it happen-

ing again.

field

of simulation

Even at W&L, we all participate in
games all the time, aside from the ob-
vious sport events.

Mixers and Halloween provide the
participants an opportunity to assume
different roles and positions, and alco-
hol and drugs provide the feeling of
vertigo (even though Caillois calls the
use of drugs for false vertigo, it stills
knocks people off their feet every
weekend).

Personally, my saddest experience
was at the Fancy Dress Ball, where the
masks could have been the tools for
an enormous game of simulation, but
instead, people quickly lost interest
and deﬂated the event of any power it
could have had.

So think about it.

Olympic games.

This, of course, all seems
very long-winded and useless,
but by broadening the deﬁni-
tion of a game to various non-
productive pastime events,
Caillois opens a discussion of
what attributes are perceived
as admirable.

VT needs

While national press
dramatizes tragedy,
the Hokies try to heal

hen tragedy struck Virginia

Tech earlier this month,

one news organization led .
the way with its coverage.

It wasn’t CNN, NBC, or the Washington
Post who provided the best coverage.

Brian Williams, Anderson Cooper, and
Nancy Grace weren’t the people who got
the story right.

The best coverage came from the Colle-
giate Times, Tech’s student-run newspaper.
The Times, working with a staff of about 35
people, turned out an amazing succession
of newspapers in the days after the shoot-
ing.

Their work is proof that the best press
coverage is sometimes the least sensation- .
al. While the national press was competing
for big headlines and dramatic footage, the
journalists at Virginia Tech were just qui-
etly doing their job.

The-paper’s website got so many hits
that they had to move over to a bigger serv-
er. Using the web, the Times was reporting
on the story by 9:45 a.m., just two hours
after the initial shooting.

Throughout the past two weeks, the stu-
dent journalists at Virginia Tech have been
consistently scooping news organizations
with multi-million dollar budgets. Their
coverage has been poignant, but the paper
has also not shied away from serious inves-
tigative reporting.

One day aﬂer the shooting, the paper ran
a story that said the school had been slow ‘
to order a lockdown of West Ambler-John-
son Hall, where gunman Cho Seung-Hui
killed two students nearly two hours before
he shot and killed 30 more people in Nor- C
ris Hall.

Along the way, the paper has managed to
provide comprehensive coverage while still
respecting the privacy of 33 families who
are grieving from this tragedy. The paper’s
photographers and reporters have provided
coverage that students have embraced.

Students at Tech were frustrated-—and at
times furious—with how the national me-
dia covered the events of Monday, April 16.
But while they tried to keep national report-
ers out, students turned around and were
willing to speak with their fellow students.

There’s no great secret to why Tech .
students would speak with the Collegiate

' Times but wanted to shut out the national
press. While the national press was sen-
sationalizing the tragedy and blanketing
Blacksburg with cameras, the Times was
providing coverage that mattered.

One minute, these Tech students were
shoving past TV cameras so they could
make it to class. The next minute they were
giving the Times interviews describing
what they went through on April 16.

The staffers at the Collegiate Times
weren’t worried about television ratings or
newspaper sales. Instead of trying to draw 
the most readers or make the biggest splash,
these students covered the story thoroughly,
accurately, and respectﬁilly. .

Their work was a spectacular success. ;

Media sensationalism is nothing new. '
It’s been going on in American journalism
since the 1800s. But the Collegiate Times
has showed us this month that the best re-
porting is sometimes the quietest.

The coverage even has some journalists
saying that the paper deserves a Pulitzer
Prize, joumalism’s highest honor.

The Pulitzer judges could not recall
a student organization ever winning that .
award. That should change next spring ’
when the Pulitzer awards for 2007 are an-
nounced.

, The Washington Post might win Pulit-
zers for its coverage of the Army’s Walter
Reed Medical Center. Perhaps the New
York Times will win awards. But both of
those organizations are run by profession-
als, not students. '

Whether or not the Collegiate Times
wins that award, during the last two weeks
that small collegiate paper has shown jour-
nalism at its finest.

Tech fair promotes
hidden resources

Experts Show 0]?‘ new technology

By Emlly Peck
surr WRITER

Technology experts gathered
Friday to show off the latest tools
available to students and faculty
at Washington and Lee.

The event featured poster ses-
sions and presentations on tech-
nology tools available to students
and faculty.

Leybum Library and Univer-
sity Computing staff members
discussed topics covering every-
thing from simple web skills (for
technologically challenged indi-
viduals) to slightly more compli-
cated software like Refworks, a
program designed to automati-
cally produce a bibliography.

Students and faculty who
stopped by the fair were even
eligible for prizes, including an
80GB video Ipod and an Epson
laser printer. Turnout was low,
however, despite the giveaways.

The prizes were purchased
with funds from University
Computing and Leybum Library
in the hope that students would
be encouraged to attend, said
John White, one of the organiz-
ers of the fair and head of the
University Help Desk. “The fair
was designed to generate interest
in technologies,” said White.

The small number of students
who wandered in and out of the
fair throughout the day would
seem to indicate that interest
in technology is far from high
among students.

Fellow organizer and Refer-
ence Librarian John Tombarge,
said that the event wasn’t just in-
tended for students but for mem-
bers of the faculty as well.

W&L spends a good deal |

of money each year on giving
students and professors access
to technologies and online da-
tabases like J-STOR. J—STOR
contains millions of articles from

scholarly journals. These jour-
nals are also printed, but the on-
line database give students and
faculty access to all of the articles
in one convenient location.

Despite the availability of
these tools, “people don’t make
as much use out of them as they
might,” said Tombarge.

While the librarians were
helping explain research tech-
nology, students who work at the
help desk had a poster session
discussing the perils of social
software. With the explosion
of sites like MySpace and Face-
book and the extensive use of
programs like instant messenger,

students are not always careful
about what sort of information
they are showing the world.

The fair’s purpose was to
inform the W&L community of

just how many resources are at '

their disposal and to provide in-
struction on how to access these
tools.

The technology may not be
glamorous, but it can come in
handy the next time a profes-
sor assigns a 30—page term pa-
per. Further questions about the
goods on display can be referred
to Tombarge at Leybum Library
or to White at the computing
help desk.

ranked Carnegie Mellon 6-3. The
Generals are currently 20-2 and
ranked 17th nationally.

6-3). After a tough ﬁrst set, junior
Nelson Bunn ﬁnished the match
strongly, beating Jordan Koslosky
3-6, 6-0, 6-0. W&L was too good
for CMU in the doubles, win-
ning all three matches. Tim Ross
and Stuart Sanford defeated Ravi
Raghavan and Jordan Koslosky
8-2. Generals Jamie McCardell
and Jon Malooly came out victo-
rious over James Muliawan and
Jon Spero 9-8. Seth Feibelman
and Alex Brooke then ﬁnished off
Andrew Clearﬁeld and Yiran Liu
8-6. These doubles matches were
the difference as the Generals up-
set the Tartans. This win tied a
school record for wins set over 30
years ago.

Hampden-Sydney Tigers in the
semiﬁnals of the ODAC tourna-
ment. W&L‘ proved to be the far

ning all three matches handily.
W&L moved to 19-2 and earned a
trip to the ODAC championship.

team in the ODAC.

THE RING-TUM PHI ° 5

Men’s Golf
Drives for

Nationals

Places second

at OD/1 Cs ‘

Hornets
in victory

The Washington and Lee
men’s golf team completed its
regular season this past weekend
by placing second at the ODAC
Championship held at Poplar
Grove Golf Course in Amherst,
Va. The only team to card a lower
score than the Generals was Guil-
ford, who is ranked second in the
country.

The Generals were led by ju-
nior Nathaniel James who tied for
third overall, carding an evenﬂpar
216.

After round one, the Generals
were in third place with a team
score of 297, 14 shots behind
leader Guilford and just four shots
behind second place Bridgewater.
On day two, the Generals came
out ﬁring, shooting a 287 as a
team and cutting Guilford’s lead
in half to just seven strokes.

“Our second day 287 was
also really gratifying because
we proved we can keep up with
anyone and that we are a team to
fear,” said senior Matthew Leis-
man.

However, day three slowed the
momentum as diﬁicult playing
conditions precluded the Gener-
als making a ﬁnal push towards

winning the .tournament_.

“The? pins weren’t necessarily
harder, but as we approached the
back nine the wind picked up a lot
andthe greens became extremely
hard to the point where holding
the greens with the wind was
nearly impossible,” said Leisman.
“The scores reﬂected the harder
conditions.”

Still, as a team the Generals
posted a 306, the third-lowest
score of any team that round, and
James managed an even-par 72.

Despite placing second to a
highly ranked team, some golfers
were not satisﬁed with their ﬁn-
ish.

“I think as a team we were a
little disappointed with our ﬁnish.
Despite the fact that Guilford is
ranked number two in the coun-
try, we really felt that we had a
chance to play well and beat them
as we never really played to our
potential earlier in the season,”
said Leisman. “However, we were
heat by a very good team so we
are not totally disappointed. My
teammates and I approach every
tournament with the intent to win,
especially with a guy like Nathan-
iel [James] on our team.”

In addition to recording the
best score for the Generals, James
took home the Scholar-Athlete of
the Year Award, was named to the
all-toumament team and First All-
ODAC Team. Teammate Leisman
made Second Team All-ODAC
and Anthony Zappin was dubbed
Honorable Mention All-ODAC.

The team also enjoyed their
time together off the ﬁeld.

“I think we really just enjoy
each others company and have
grown very close as a group so
every minute is a treat,” said Leis-
man. “We like messing around
in the hotel by playing hall mini
golf, and sometimes we’re lucky
enough to get our parents to take
us out for free food at nice restau-
rants.”

Though the team did not re-
ceive the ODAC’s automatic bid
to the national tournament, the
team was optimistic about their
chances at an at large bid. In the
case the team does not receive a
bid, James is likely to be invited
to compete as an individual.

“[James] is one of, if not the,
top player in the nation,” said
Leisman. As for the team, Leis-
man said, “We do however feel
justiﬁed in getting a bid, and we
would certainly compete.”

If selected, the Generals would
compete on May 15-18 in Mt.
Carmel, Indiana.

Clayton Edwards struck out

In the second round, the Gen-
erals drew the Randolph-Macon
Yellow Jackets, a team they had
faced twice in the regular season
in a split doubleheader. The squad
answered the call that day, defeat-
ing the Jackets 12-5 behind the

5 on the day with 4 RBI.

their opening at-bat, but shortly
thereafter RMC took the lead
with a ﬁve-run third. The Gener-
als scored eight unanswered runs,
beginning with six in the bot-
tom of the fourth, to win the day.
W&L’s Brendan Clark pitched
only 3.1 innings but allowed no
earned runs and was credited with
the win. The game was closed out
by junior Jeff Pharis and fresh-
man Jim Plantholt.

Having escaped the Yellow
Jackets, the Generals faced a more
formidable opponent with the
same do-or-die situation. On Sat-
urday the squad faced third -seed-

ed Lynchburg. The Generals had
beaten the Hornets in both games
of their doubleheader in March.
Those games were in Lexington,
however, and the proximity of the
tournament’s supposedly neutral
venue to the Lynchburg campus
played a role in Lynchburg’s 14-2
win, which knocked the Generals
out of the tournament.

The Generals never really
stood a chance as LC jumped to
a ﬁve-run lead in the ﬁrst inning
against W&L freshman Chuck
Davidson, who lasted only 0.2 in-
nings before surrendering to the
bullpen.

The tournament left the squad
with an 18-14 overall record,
including pre-season and post-
season matches. In a year many
regarded as a time to rebuild
following the graduation of two
of W&L’s all time best — Taylor
McConnell and Peter Dean. Last
year, the first since their gradu-
ation, the squad was 18-15-1.
This year’s strong freshman class
could be the next golden genera-
tion for the illustrious program
and for manager Stickley, three-
time ODAC coach of the year and
the winningest baseball skipper in
school history.

Season ends for baseball

Team beats Randolph-Macon but falls to Lynchburg in a 14-2 defeat

By Brian Devine
STAFF WRITER

When a team enters a six-
team tournament as the number
ﬁve seed, most outside observ-
ers would expect it to go out
early, defeated quietly in the early
rounds. For the Washington and
Lee baseball team, simply reach-

ing the end-of-season conference
tournament, held April 26-29 in
Lynchburg, was an accomplish-
ment.

Before the season, manager
Jeff Stickley stated that “our ex-
pectation is always to make the
ODAC Tournament ﬁeld.” De-
spite reaching Stickley’s basic
goal with a record of I8-l4, the

team won only against sixth-seed-
ed Randolph-Macon and lost two
games to exit the tournament on
Saturday.

On Thursday, the squad
opened with a 7-3 loss to see-
ond-seeded Hampden—Sydney.
A three-run third inning and a
three-run fourth gave the Tigers a
7-2 lead, and their pitching staff

never let the Generals back in.
In the tournament ﬁrst round on
April 26"‘, HSC’s Larry Greene
allowed seven hits in seven in-
nings, getting his ﬁfth win of the
season. John Hobart and Bryan
Breedlove ﬁnished the ﬁnal two
innings, allowing only two more -

Women sweep ODAC tennis

F ourth-ranked team and 2006 runner—up prepares for a run at NCAA title

By Kevin Corn
smrr warm:

The women’s tennis team was
very busy over spring break with
matches against rivals Emory

University and Se-

s°°'°s wanee.
w&L 9 Later, the wom-
en were back in
ODAC 0 Lexington for the
ODAC Champion-
ships.

Considering Washington and
Lee ﬁnished second to Emory at
NCAAs last year, this was an ex-

, citing match with quite a bit on

the line.

The Generals traveled to At-
lanta with conﬁdence. This con-
ﬁdence showed as number I and
2 doubles teams consisting of
Emily Applegate and Kristen Mc-
Clung, and Katie Tabb and Ginny
Wortham won their games 8-4
and 8-1 respectively.

Emory was able to defeat
freshmen Katie Bouret and Lau-
ren Caire 8-3. ‘

In the singles games, the Gen-
erals took four of the six games.

These were won by Applegate,
Wortham, McClung, and Caire.
As a result, the women wo11 over-
all 6-3.

Senior Wortham commented.
“It is always great to beat Emory,
especially on their courts. They
are always a good team and we
have to come out ready to play. I
think everyone really focused on
their respective matches in dou-
bles and singles and we were able
to walk away with a great win.”

The Generals also played
against Sewanee over the break,
taking an extremely important
win over the Tigers.

In doubles, Applegate and Mc-
Clung, and Tabb and Wortham
won 8-1. The number 3 doubles
consisting of Bouret and Leah
Weston fell short to the Tigers.

In singles matches, the Gener-
als won four of the six contests.
Applegate, Wortham, Kelly Will,
and Caire all won in two sets. Mc-
Clung barely lost in a tie-breaker
during her singles match.

The following weekend, the
Generals were back at home for

the ODAC Championships. Dur-
ing the tournament, the women
did not lose one match.

First to fall to the Generals was
Sweet Briar College. Every dou-
bles game ended in a score of ei-
ther 8-0 or 8-1. The singles games
were all won in two straight sets
— most 6-0, 6-0.

The next day, the Generals

. took on Hollins and again notched

a 9-0 win.

Applegate and McClung won
their doubles match with a score
of 8-2. The other two doubles
teams of Tabb and Wortham, and
Weston and Will defeated their
opponents by a score of 8-0.

In the singles matches, the
women again won almost every
game to end the day with a 9-0

victory.

The last day of the tourna-
ment, the women played against
Virginia Wesleyan.

All three doubles teams won in
convincing fashion.

In singles, Virginia Wesleyan
was also swept with victories from
Applegate (6-0, 6-0), Wortham
(6-0, 6-0), Tabb (6-2, 6-0), Mc-
Clung (6-0, 6-0), Will (6-0, 6-1),
and Caire (6-0, 6-0).

As a result, the Generals won
ODACs and automatically re-
ceived a bid to the D-III NCAA
Tournament.

After this win, Wortham re-
ﬂected, “I think our goals for
ODACS is to win at every posi-
tion, and we made sure that we
accomplished this goal. Winning

ODACs was a good end to our
spring break and a good way to
kick off our post-season.”

As the Generals look ahead
to NCAAs, they continue to dili-
gently practice in hopes of win-
ning the national title this May.

“I think we all know what we
need to do in order to be success-
ful” said Wortham.

“Since tennis is a team sport
that focuses on the results of in-
dividuals, we are all working on
various aspects of our singles and
doubles games so that we can start
off strong at regionals,” Wortham
said. “I think we’re trying to just
take it a match at a time and try-
ing to make sure that we come out
playing our very best tennis and
peak at the appropriate time.”
