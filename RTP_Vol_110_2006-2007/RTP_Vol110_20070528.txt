Mock Con speaker and 2004 candidate says he may run again for White House

By Wesley 0’Dell
surr wmmz

Students gathered in front of
Lee Chapel on Friday to hear
a one-time—and perhaps fu-
ture——candidate for the Demo-
cratic presidential nomination.
Retired four-star General Wesley
Clark spoke to a large crowd on
the sun-baked front lawn about
politics, the rigors of being a
presidential candidate, and the
current group of Democratic
contenders.

Though Clark steadfastly re-
fuses to commit himself either to
run or not to run in 2008, his sup-
porters apparently failed to get
that memo; they roamed among
the pre—speech crowd distribut-
ing business cards advertising
the General’s fundraising organi-
zation and, innocuously enough,
handing out chocolate “Clark
Bars.”

It had the feel of a political
rally about it—appropriately so
for the 100'“ anniversary of the
most accurate and acclaimed
nominating convention simula-
tion.

Mock Con General Chairman
Richard Friedman and President
Kenneth Ruscio gave brief in-
troductory remarks before Clark
took the podium; Ruscio, a for-
mer Mock Con Co-Chair him-
self, quipped that the ’08 Mock

Con “will force students to be-
come Democrats, a role that——
for some of them at least——will
be a challenge.”

Clark began his speech by
noting his ﬁrst visit to campus
with his son many years ear-
lier; his son, also named Wesley,
spent the night in a frat house—
an experience he enjoyed great-
ly. The General thought it was
“one of the great mistakes of [my
son’s] young life’’ not to come
to W&L, whose namesakes he
said “epitomized the quality of
leadership—leadership in war,
leadership in peace, leadership
of vision and compassion.”

2004 revisited

Clark’s remarks touched on
his own experiences as a presi-
dential candidate, a process he
described as “grueling” and
“demeaning.” He lamented the
effectiveness of negative at-
tack ads, and expressed concern
about excessive partisanship in
the process: “Don’t condemn
disagreement,” he said, “there is
a duty to be a responsible oppo-
sition.”

He mentioned a particular
piece of advice given to him by
former Virginia Governor Mark
Warner: “in politics, what you
can lose is everything. . .so if you
can live without it, don’t do it.”

In both his prepared remarks
and a press conference held af-
terward, Clark named his deci-
sion to skip the Iowa Caucuses
as fatal to his campaign: “It was
a‘ strategy developed to combat
Howard Dean...it didn’t work
for one reason: Howard Dean
didn’t win Iowa.”

He advised Mock Con par-
ticipants to examine the Demo-
cratic ﬁeld for what he called the
key to victory in any campaign:
a combination of name recogni-
tion, brand image, and money.

“I think every day

about running. ”

WESLEY CLARK, klckoff
speaker

During the ‘press conference,
Clark elaborated on the impor-
tance of brand image. Two days
before the Iowa caucuses, a re-
porter asked a telling question:
“John Kerry was a war hero--he
won a silver star and a purple
heart in Vietnam—You were
in the military, weren’t you in
Vietnam, too? How does your
military record compare to John
Kerry’s?”

Said General Clark, himself
a decorated combat veteran of
Vietnam but also a four-star

general, “if you have to explain
that three days before the vote in
Iowa, then you know you didn’t
build the brand image to deﬁne
yourself.”

Politics new and old

Clark also took the audience
on a brief tour of the current po-
litical climate and how it came
about. He praised international
efforts during the Cold War to
deter Soviet aggression and as-
serted that American victory
validated a foreign policy based
on human rights and the consent
of the governed. He particularly
emphasized what he called a
“national strategy” during that
period which directed everything
from nuclear missiles to Olym-
pic teams in an all-encompassing
effort to confront the Soviets.

“However, after the Cold
War,” he said, “we lost our ad-
versary and we lost our. strat-
egy.”

It was this loss of national fo-
cus, he claimed, that left the U.S.
open to turmoil in foreign policy
and ultimately led to missteps in
the years following 9/11.

He talked up his own cre-
dentials on national planning,
recounting his attempt while a
top general to gather support
for what he called a “strategy of
engagement and enlargement”

designed to counter rogue states,
nuclear proliferation, narco-tcr-
rorism, and the possibility of a
resurgent Russia. His plan was
never carried out, however, and

‘he even quipped that “today, a

‘strategy of engagement and en-
largement’ would sound like a
spam message for a men’s phar-
maceutical product.”

He minced no words when it
came to Iraq, which he called the
“overriding issue” of the current
political scene and “the presi-
dent’s war.”

“His plan, his war,” said
Clark, adding that there is “no
end in sight.” An avowed inter-
nationalist who has called for
America to join the International
Criminal Court, Clark particular-
ly criticized what he called “the
devastating impact on the legiti-
macy of U.S. aims and methods
in the world.”

He maintained that the war the
U.S. must ﬁght is one of hearts
and minds, saying that “we can’t
succeed by killing people.”

He also mentioned other
challenges facing the nation, in-
cluding the emergence of China
as an economic power “with the
potential for causing us to ques-
tion who we are as a nation” and
issues “too big for one nation to
solve” such as disease, climate
change, and human rights.

Campaign ‘08

Clark also favored the audi-
ence with a few comments on
the current candidates for the
White House, who he said were
now “competing for money and
endorsements.” He described
Ohio representative Dennis Ku-
cinich as “a legitimate candi-
date,” called Joe Biden “a very
credible analyst,” and remarked
that John Edwards “wants to be
president” and has “independent
means—no normal job.”

He called Barrack Obama a
“phenomenon” and praised Hill-
ary Clinton for having “seen it
all.”

Clark also conceded that the
candidate who claims the Demo-
cratic nomination may not yet
be in the race. “I haven’t said
I’m not running,” he said in re-
sponse to a question about who
he would endorse. When the Phi
pointed out his popularity on the
speaking circuit during the ’O6
midterrns, suggesting it was a
strong incentive for him to run,
Clark mischievously responded
“I’ve thought about it.”

“We’re not gonna get you
to budge, are we?” said the re-
porter.

Clark responded with a laugh,
“I think every day about run-
ning.”

Members of the Young Democrats and College Republicans consider a question during Wednesday night's debate (above). The donkeys chose to wear more casual attire,
while the elephants stuck to more conservative dress. The two sides clashed on whether the United States needed a timetable for withdrawing from Iraq but found common
ground on issues such as immigration and global warming. (Below) Senior David Kronenfeld answers a question for the College Republicans during the debate.

Student debate and political panel discuss 200819 issues

By Dane Davis and
Grace Wang
STAFF wamaas

Four distinguished leaders from the
world of politics addressed the Wash-
ington and Lee community on May 24
as part of the Spring Kickoff of the 2008
Democratic Mock Convention.

Hosted by Wesley Little, a junior
Economics major, Washington and Lee
welcomed Mike Allen, Steve Jarding,
Dr. Larry Sabato, and Chuck Todd to a
Presidential Issues panel discussion held
in Lee Chapel.

The panelists were excited and hon-
ored to contribute to what is considered
one of W&L’s ﬁnest traditions.

Sabato said, “I wish every college in
the nation could have a Moc Convention
like yours. You instill civic virtues in a
new generation of young people.”

Entertaining questions from profes-
sors and students, the four panelists en-
gaged in lively discussion about key is-

T sues concerning our democratic system,

such as the 2008 presidential campaign,
the electoral system, and Virginia’s fu-
ture role in politics.

Mike Allen, a Washington and Lee
‘86 alumnus and chief political corre-
spondent for Politico, a 2008 campaign

' news website, assessed the campaigns of

Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack
Obama, and Republican Fred Thomp-
son.

Allen said the Obama campaign is
high-energy but lacks the organization
and experience of the Hilary Clinton
campaign.

On Republican Fred Thompson’s
possible run for the presidency, Allen

‘believes that Mr. Thompson will indeed

run and is pursuing a smart strategy by
waiting for political exhaustion to affect

’ the other candidates’ campaigns.

Steve Jarding, a campaign manager,
has had a long-standing history organiz-
ing and winning numerous political cam-
paigns.

In 2001, Jarding propelled Mark War-
ner into the gubernatorial seat of Vir-
ginia. Recently, Jarding ran the seem-
ingly hopeless yet ultimately successful
campaign of current Virginia Senator Jim
Webb.

In addition, Jarding examined mon-

‘ey’s‘ overwhelming inﬂuence on the

current political system and the rise of
citizen democracy through the intemet.
He discussed how S.R. Sidarth, a young
Indian-American student, was able to dra-
matically alter American politics through
his use of Youtube. By capturing Repub-
lican George Allen’s use of the term ‘ma-
caca,’ an offensive term for dark-skinned
people used by French colonists in North
Africa, on camcorder and later posting
this clip on Youtube, Sidarth essentially
ruined the Allen campaign.

Another of the panelists, Dr. Larry Sa-
bato, the Robert Kent Gooch Professor of
Politics at the University of Virginia, has
been called the most quoted college pro-
fessor in the country by the Wall Street
Journal.

Sabato spoke about what he believes
to be the “absolutely insane, abrupt, and
stupid” schedule of the primary system.

When asked about second-tier candi-
dates and their odds in primaries, Sabato
said, “Mike Huckabee lost 110 pounds,
but Jared [from Subway] lost more. Why
shouldn’t Jared be President?”

Sabato also spoke about Virginia’s
changing political climate and empha-
sized how it is moving away from being
an overwhelmingly red state into “one
purplish with a reddish tint.”

When questioned about the impor-
tance of Iowa, Sabato expressed his con-
ﬁdence in the Iowans to pick a principled
and skilled presidential candidate. He
also explained Iowa’s hesitation in elect-
ing another Clinton. If Hilary won the
presidency, two American families would
have held the White House for 25 years.

Sabato said, “Iowans will consider
‘Are we the American republic or are we
a Banana Republic?”

Chuck Todd, NBC News’ political di-
rector and a distant relative of Robert E.
Lee, spoke about Al Gore’s chances for
entering the presidential race.

Todd believes it is unlikely Gore will
enter the race. He explained that Gore
has already supported Obama as acandi-
date and added jokingly that if Gore were
to run, his waist size would go down.

The College Republicans and the
Young Democrats engaged in lively po-
litical discussion of their own, holding
a debate on May 23 in the Stackhouse
Theater.

Representing the College Republicans
were seniors David Kronenfeld and Hank

Gates and sophomore Jack Stanton. The
Young Democrats were led by sopho-
mores Jack Fisher and Oliver Krischik
and freshman Matt May.

Led by Little, the debaters addressed
key hot-button issues such as illegal im-
migration, the wisdom of enforcing a
timetable for exiting Iraq, feasible alter-
native fuel sources, and the beneﬁts of
adopting a universal health care system.

The Young Republicans took a strong
stance against illegal immigration.

Gates, a Politics and History major,
stated that illegal immigration is a bur-
den on the ﬁscal system and a threat to
national security.

He added, “A nation without borders
is not a nation.”

Fisher, a Politics major, agreed with
Gates for the most part.

Regarding the war in Iraq, the Young
Democrats believed that a timetable for
exiting the country is feasible and for
the best interests of the American public.
May stated that the government should
inform the American people what they
hope to accomplish and must do so with-
in an allotted time frame.

The College Republicans disagreed,
saying that setting a timetable is unnec-
essary.

Both sides agreed that the nation must
work diligently to ﬁnd alternative fuel
sources.

Kronenfeld listed several possibilities
for alternative fuel, such as hydrogen, air,
solar power, wind, and biodiesel and ex-
plained the pros and cons of each.

May said improving the environment
should be a collaborative effort between
world nations and that a global initiative
to stop global warming is feasible. He
also added that everyone should go out
and plant a tree to improve the quality of
the environment, a statement that caused
the entire audience to erupt in laughter.

The greatest disagreement of the de-
bate came during discussion about a uni-
versal health care system.

Krischik, a Politics and Psychology
double major, believes that every human
being deserves the right to health care.
He also added that it would be economi-
cally beneﬁcial to employ one large and
overarching health care system.

Gates disagreed, saying that adopting
a universal health care system would be
a ﬁnancial burden. He also questioned

who would beneﬁt from this change be-
sides the individuals receiving health care
who would not have previously.

Sarah Keckler, a freshman from Gard-
ners, Penn., does not think that a polar-
ized debate would have been necessarily
better. She noticed that several of the
questions asked, such as whether to pur-
sue alternative fuel sources, were not set
up for intensive disagreement.

“I don’t think there is anyone out
there—Republican or Democrat—who
would argue that we should not search
out alternative sources.”

However, Keckler was disappointed
by the lack of preparation by the Young
Democrats.

She said, “It was obvious the Republi-
cans were better prepared. Their answers

all contained statistics backing up their
claims while the Democrats were not as
ready.”

Keckler also noted that there was a
clear differentiation between the two
groups in terms of physical appearance.

She said, “The College Republican
representatives were in suits and ties and
had a more professional aura. On the op-
posite side of the coin, the Young Demo-
crat representatives were dressed down.”

Still, Keckler enjoyed the student de-
bate immensely.

She said, “[The debate] inspired me
to start reading more about today’s issues
and learning my own personal viewpoints
on them. It kind of erased that jaded feel-
ing towards politics that has been preva-
lent in our community.”

Ruscio reﬂects on his first year

W&L president sits down to discuss accomplishments and upcoming projects

By Jacob Gelger
MANAGING EDITOR

As Ken Ruscio’s ﬁrst year
as president draws to a close,
Managing Editor Jacob Geiger
sat down with the Class of 1976
alumnus to discuss the key events
of the past year. Though his term
is only nine months old, the new
president has already helped ﬁ-
nalize the new strategic plan and
prepare for future changes.

Ruscio discussed some of the
university’s accomplishments be-
fore going on to detail the goals

this year, whether it’s something
you completed, a project that is
just getting started or a change
you instituted?

Ruscio: I think this was a year
of setting the table for future proj-
ects. Probably the biggest thing
was bringing the Strategic Plan
to conclusion; it was approved
by the Board of Trustees at their
meeting a few weeks ago.

What that does is provide a
clear goal and vision for where
the university wants to be.  It’s
a very ambitious but achievable
plan.

“On the physical plant side we are going to
renovate the Colonnade, replace DuPont Hall,
build a new stadium and rehabilitate the resi-
dential life area.  The stadium will be coming

sooner rather than later ”

KEN RUSCIO, W&L President

 

he and the school will pursue
both next year and further down
the road.

He also discussed what chal-
lenges Washington and Lee will
face in the coming years.

Phi: What’s your most vivid or
exciting memory from the year?

Ruscio: I suppose in a lot of
ways inauguration will stand out
in so many ways, none of them
because of me. It was so pow-
erful for the community  stu-
dents, alumni, faculty and staff to
come together.

Phi: What is the most impor-
tant thing you have accomplished

Phi: What is the biggest proj-
ect for next year?

Ruscio: There are really four
parts to the strategic plan, though
some parts really want come into
effect until years eight, nine or
ten.

The ﬁrst part focuses on stu-
dents, especially making sure we
have the resources to continue to
attract the type of students that we
have historically gotten.

The second part involves fac-
ulty and staff, speciﬁcally being
able to recruit and retain the top
people in each ﬁeld. The third
proposal has to do with academic

initiatives in the law and under-
graduate areas of the school.

Finally, the fourth part is pre-
paring a campus for the 215‘ cen-
tury, with a theme of how do we
educate our future leaders for a
215‘ century world.

There are several projects
coming. The ﬁrst is to shore up
the endowment for ﬁnancial aid,
so that very talented students are
not deterred form attending W&L
because of cost.

The second area is in part
addressed by that generous gift
[from Gerry Lenfest] for faculty
endowment. You know, we didn’t
realize this right away, but in the
last few weeks we have found out
that this is the sixth largest gift
ever given to a national liberal
arts college.

On the physical plant side we
are going to renovate the Colon-
nade, replace DuPont Hall, build
a new stadium and rehabilitate the
residential life area.

Now obviously not all of this
will happen right away, but the
stadium will be coming sooner
rather than later. We’ve also
drawn plans up for renovating
Newcomb Hall. That might start
a year from now if our fundrais-
ing goes well.

Phi: What will be the impact
of the Lenfest donation?

Ruscio: Here’s the way that
will work: Our goal is to be at
the mean of compensation for our
peers, so we’re looking at the top
25 liberal arts institutions. We’re
a little bit below that right now. ...
What you’ll see is not so much a

huge, dramatic, overnight differ-
ence, but 10, 20 or 30 years from
now. Gradually over the next
three to ﬁve years salaries will
move up.

Phi: The Virginia Tech shoot-
ings have dominated the news
and education world this spring.
When will the campus’s security
upgrade be ready?

Rusico: By early fall, if not the
very beginning of the fall semes-
ter. We’re pretty much there right
now.  I think our size certainly
works in our favor in heading off
a crisis and also in responding to
any sort of crisis.

Phi: How good is tolerance
— whether regarding race, gender
or anything else — at W&L?

Ruscio: I think one of the at-
tributes of W&L is we have very
high standards in that area. We
ought to be the kind of university
others look to in regards to show-
ing respect for others.

This is really in regards to our
values as an institution. In the
next week or two I’ll send out an
e-mail reminding people of the
high standards we have in that
area.

Phi: Is W&L involved with
the plans to bring the Museum of
the Confederacy to Lexington?
Does the university have an offi-
cial position?

Ruscio: I and the university
have not been contacted in any
formal way by a representative
from the museum. What I’ve said
to anyone who has asked is that
I cannot imagine any formal re-
lationship between the university

and the museum.

Our missions are very differ-
ent. The museum is in Richmond
right now next to two universities
in Virginia Commonwealth and
the University of Richmond, and
I don’t think there is a close rela-
tionship with either school.

We are not included in the pro-
posal to the museum [that Lex-
ington submitted]. I did ask the
city and tourism board that we not
be included in the proposal.

to make the ﬁnances work.

Phi: What is W&L’s biggest
challenge for the future?

Ruscio: I think our core
strength is in our people — faculty,
staff and students. We are in an
increasingly competitive environ-
ment for those people. We are in
good shape now  we operate
from a position of great strength,
I think, but I want to make sure
we maintain that strength. ... that
is the challenge.

Republicans race to rule

The top 12 Republican candidatesfor the presidency

By Wes Little
COLUMNIST

The past two months have
been busy ones in the race for the
Republican Presidential Nomina-
tion.

In April, the results of the ﬁrst
quarter of campaign fundrais-
ing results were reported, an an-
nouncement that gave renewed
strength to Mitt Romney and
Rudy Guliani while harming the
McCain campaign.

Also shaking up this race
signiﬁcantly is the indication
that conservative favorites Fred
Thompson and Newt Gingrich
will enter the race. The probable
inclusion of these two candidates
adds extra competition for the
supporters, endorsements and
campaign cash needed to win the
nomination.

In this segment The Campaign
Candor, I will give you an idea of
the current status and standings of
the Republican Presidential race.

1. Mayor Rudy Giuliani
“America’s Mayor” has tight-
ened his grip on the leadership of
this race with high national poll
numbers around 27 percent, a suc-
cessful $15 million fundraising
haul and two successful debates.
He must keep the Republican
electorate’s focus on his national
security gravitas and away from
his unpopular views on social is-

C 0 L U M N I S T

Apparently, it turned out that I
indeed had one more edition of the

considered alternate theorists to
write about in my last article, I
have chosen a dark horse: Niklas
Luhmann.

sues in order to continue his mo-
mentum.

2. Sen. Fred Thompson

Without even announcing that
he will run for president, this for-
mer Tennessee senator and current
Law & Order actor has enthralled
the conservative base of the party
and given them the hope of hav-
ing a viable social conservative in
the race. Look for Thompson to
start quietly locking up important
supporters and staff and make an
announcement in the ﬁrst part of
June.

3. Sen. John McCain

Once the race’s clear leader,
Senator McCain’s campaign suf-
fered in April following his disap-
pointing fundraising results of $ 1 2
million and falling polling num-
bers. However, McCain’s strong
debate presence, experienced
campaign team and strength in
states like Iowa and New Hamp-
shire make him impossible to
count out in this race.

4. Gov. Mitt Romney

This former governor of Mas-
sachusetts used his strong network
of supporters to raise $22 million
in the ﬁrst quarter of this year,
more than any of his competitors.
Nonetheless, he will have to deal
with questions about his Mormon-
ism and ideological ﬂip-ﬂopping
in order to raise his poll numbers

Luhmann works out of a radi-
cal school of system theory, and
his main focus is the improbabil-

above his current position in the
10 percent range.

5. Gov. Mike Huckabee

This fonner Arkansas gover-
nor has performed very well in
the debates but still has miniscule
polling numbers and little money
from fundraising with which to
raise them.

6. Rep. Newt Gingrich

No one excites the Conserva-
tive base like this former House
Speaker, but it is unclear if Gin-
grich’s plan to enter the race near
September could garner enough

. support to convince Republican

voters to nominate one of the most
divisive politicians around. His
strategy may also be hampered
the entrance of fellow conserva-
tive favorite Fred Thompson.

7, Rep. Tom Tancredo

This Colorado congressman’s
campaign could rise with the
prominence of his signature is-
sue, immigration, in the minds of
Republican voters. His $1 million
ﬁrst quarter fundraising was sur-
prisingly strong but his poll num-
bers are still hovering not far from
zero percent.

8. Sam Brownback

He led the “second tier” in
fundraising with $1.25 million,
but his sub-par performance in
the debates and tiny polling re-

zations divide the world in a bi-
nary code: The organization itself
and the surroundings.

The organization itself is de-
scribed as a ‘black box,’ as one
will never be able to grasp the
entirety of its ideology. Pushing
this further, Luhmann also claims
that humans too are ‘black boxes’
whose internal motivations don’t
mean anything.

Realizing that organizations
are based on communication,
Luhmann breaks up the act of
communicating into three parts:
information, discourse and con-
nection. Infonnation represents
the facts that are presented, dis-
course is the way it is communi-
cated and connection is how fur-
ther communication reacts to the
message.

The latter part is crucial to un-
derstanding Luhmann, as a mes-
sage isn’t communication ‘until
further messages are based on it.

sults raise serious doubts about
his potential of breaking into the
group of top candidates.

9. Rep. Duncan Hunter

A San Diego congressman
with experience and expertise in
military matters, Hunter lacks
signiﬁcant campaign cash and
has yet to ﬁnd a constituency in
this crowded and likewise accom-
plished ﬁeld.

10. Gov. Tommy Thompson

The former Governor of Wis-
consin and_the leader of his state’s
acclaimed reform of welfare,
Thompson has one of the best
governing records in the race but
seemed genuinely lost in the past
two debates.

11. Rep. Ron Paul

This former Libertarian can-
didate for president and current
Texas congressman has an en-
ergetic group of supporters, but
they will probably not be enough
to garner this eccentric candidate
enough support to be a serious
force in this race. A current mo-
tion to limit the size of the debates
would likely end Paul’s chances.

12. Gov. Jim Gilmore

No one is quite sure why this
former Governor of Virginia is
running for president, as evi-
denced by his paltry $175,000
ﬁrst quarter fundraising.

The communication within the
organization is therefore the self-
referential and reproducing force
that provides the organization its
internal logic and understanding.
No decision or articulated aim is
truly tangible until further com-
munication validates it as being
so.

For example WWII isn’t nec-
essarily more important than me
buying a piece of gum, but the ac-
ademic (and loose) organization
of historians continuously per-
petuate the signiﬁcance of WWII
by relating to previous notions of
its importance.

So how does an organization
make decisions? Each decision
made requires a choice between
alternatives, or else it wouldn’t
be a choice. Since one alterna-
tive isn’t essentially better than
the other, one would suspect or-
ganizations to be paralyzed when
faced with this paradox of unity

People ask all the time if we compete against the Trident.
There’s a perception on campus that the two staffs are always
trying to get the better of each other, always trying to out do

To some extent, that might be true. The Phi’s writers and
editors always want to beat the Trident to a scoop, and we

But beyond that, both papers have the same mission and the
same goals: we want to serve the community, report the news
and provide forums for community discussion.

We have different styles, different layouts and different
staffs. We focus our energy on different issues.

But it’s all the same mission.

That’s why the two papers joined together in April to pro-
duce a pair of special editions that covered the campus’s ﬁrst
Open Hearing in more than a decade.

At the risk of sounding arrogant or self-congratulatory, we
think W&L’s student press is in better shape these days than it

Both student newspapers have made some great strides this
year, and we’ve also been fortunate enough to see a student-
run news show come to campus as well.

There’s no denying that the last three years have been tu-
multuous ones for the Phi. The paper has been completely re-
designed, gone through a huge amount of staff turnover, and
weathered its share of controversy.

Whether it was Behind Bars, heated debates on the edito-
rial pages about admissions standards or controversy between
students and angry neighbors, the Phi has tried to keep up with

In the coming year there will certainly be more important
issues to discuss, whether it’s the Museum of the Confedera-

dedicated to keeping you informed.

in difference.

The solution, Luhmann ar-
gues, is that organizations never
make that realization and instead
communication just arbitrarily
chooses one option as its infor-
mation. Depending on whether or
not this communication is accept-
ed or challenged by future com-
munication, this may evolve into
a decision or be forgotten. As a
result, organizations only operate
on the level of ﬁrst order observa-
tion, where the alternatives aren’t
presented in the communication.

Differentiating between rel-
evant and irrelevant communica-
tion is done through a binary cod-
ing, determining whether or not
the communication involves the
organization.

as one big system, one will see
that it never deals with the healthy

be ‘outside’ the system.

 self-referential mode as communication within an organziation provide ‘iinternailogic; understanding ‘I’

Practically, Luhmann’s theory
provides the tools for observing
behavior within groups.

For example the statement
“Let’s have a party tonight” isn’t
relevant until further communica-
tion validates it as a decision. And
likewise saying “I’d like a burger
right now” in class is considered
outside the system of academic
learning, whereas it might be in-
cluded in the system of friendship
to which you are saying it.

The most criticized part of
Luhmann’s system theory is his
complete disdain for human mo-
tivation and emotion. We are per-
ceived as mere cogs in a greater
system, albeit being able to par-
ticipate in several systems.

But this radicalism is essential
for Luhmann in order to move
beyond a system theory that deals
with ideology and instead deals
with the direct constitution of the
system.

Surviving Karnataka

Spring Term in India a crazy but charming experience

By Jess Steinmetz
COLU M N I sr

While most W&L students are
currently in the midst of a tradi-
tional Spring Term of studying
and partying in Lexington, I along
with 23 of my peers am in a world
so very different than the one we
are familiar with.

Along with three professors,
we are braving the streets of My-
sore, a city located in Kamataka,
India.

As a group, W&L students re-
ally stand out in Mysore. Most of
us are taller than the average In-
dian, dress in western clothes, do
not speak Hindi, have American
accents and many members of the
group are very pale and/or blond.

All this makes us prime targets
for attention, especially by ven-
dors.

Shopping in India is complete-
ly different than any type of shop-
ping back home. Prices are never
set, even when signs claim other-
wise. Some stores even go really
far out and hang signs in broken

English such as, “Customer is
King. King never Bargain.”

While salespeople in America
are often quite persistent, I have
never been followed around town
by one. In India, this happens
almost every single time we go
out.

Since we are “tourists,” we
are of course targeted by vendors.
They always follow my friends
and I to try to sell us something
that we genuinely have no need
for, would never dream of buy-
ing, did not even look at in the
ﬁrst place or is often just plain
confusing.

Why would I buy Q-tips, for
example, at the Palace of My-
sore?

We get around town in rig-
shaws, which is a phenomenon
that truly must be experienced
ﬁrsthand. But since most of you
will probably never set a foot in
India, I will do my best to ex-
plain.

A rigshaw is a mix between a
motorized car and a bike. They
have no doors and seatbelts and

under law can only hold up to
three passengers. We, however,
have had as many as seven of us
in one.

In India, or at least in Kama-
taka, there are yellow lines down
the middle similar to the ones we
have in the States. Back home,
drivers often break the holy yel-
low line to pass a slow car.

Crazy drivers, like my grand-
pa (who felt that these lines are
merely suggestions and drove on
the middle or even the wrong side
of the road), do exist. Nearly ev-
ery driver in Kamataka, however,
must truly believe that these lines
are suggestions. _

I am still not even sure why
they have these lines. All of the
rigshaws I have driven in are just
as much on the wrong side of the
road as on the right one.

Surprisingly, I have not seen a
single accident. This is probably
due to the fact that the average
rigshaw driver uses his horn ap-
proximately every ﬁve seconds.

While this of course gets quite
old on a 10 minute drive into

the city, it just adds to the crazy
charm of India.

Prices are extremely reason-
able in India, even for a broke
college student like me. I love go-
ing out to eat at a hotel and hav-
ing it cost less than three dollars.
Living in an environment where
40 rupees equals one American
dollar skews traditional concepts
of bargaining.

This is where the rigshaw and
shopping experiences meet its
most ridiculous point: bargaining
for a rigshaw. Although rigshaws
have meters, both the passengers
and the driver often try to avoid
them, hoping to beneﬁt through
bargaining.

Whenever we go out in
groups, one person always ends
up bargaining with the driver
down to the last rupee. Last night
for example, my friend bargained
for ﬁve minutes over ﬁve rupees,
which is the equivalent of 12
cents.

And that is when you just have
to laugh and love the craziness of
India.

Cast ofKiss—ll4e,r~KaIe.~ 

keeps audience laughing

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

Anyone who’s watched shows at
W&L over the last few years should no
longer be surprised when Lauren Kampf
steals the show.

But this weekend in the Lenfest Cen-
ter, Kampf did just that, wowing audi-
ences with biting, bitter and sarcastic
rendition of Lilli Vanessi and Kate in
“Kiss Me, Kate.”

Her standout performance capped a
busy and successful career on the W&L
stages.

“It’s deﬁnitely bittersweet,” Kampf
said after opening night. “This cast is
awesome and so much fun to work with,
but it’s bittersweet since this is my last
show.”

“Kiss Me, Kate” gives the audience
a backstage look at a dysfunctional the-
ater company trying to perform Shake-
speare’s “Taming of the Shrew” on a hot
summer night in Baltimore.

“Working with [Lauren]
is a dream. She takes

direction really well
and brings so much to a

character ’

ROB MISH, director
 

Lilli Vanessi is the company’s female
star, a temperamental woman who also
happens to be divorced from Fred Gra-
ham, the show’s director, writer, chore-
ographer and male star. They appear to
have made their peace, but then Vanessi
gets the ﬂowers and note that Graham
had meant to send to another actress.
The result is less than cheery.

Kampf and Matt Amling, the sopho-
more who played Graham, hold a snarl-
ing and nasty ﬁght that rages both on
stage and off. Kate’s solo mid-way
through Act One really says it all: “I
Hate Men.”

Amling played Graham as the straight
man, letting Kampf provide most of the
comedy at his expense. On the musical
numbers, however, he took a backseat
to nobody and his powerful, impressive
voice ﬁlled the packed theater.

And to make sure things didn’t get
too slow, a pair of gangsters were hang-
ing around throughout the show, trying

to collect $10,000 from Graham. Real-
izing that the gangsters might give him
some leverage, Graham tells them that
he won’t have their money unless the
show is a success.

When Vanessi won’t return to the
stage because Graham had given her
a severe on-stage spanking, the gang-
sters switch their double-breasted suits
out for Shakespearean tights. They do,
however, bring their pistols along.

As the play rolled along, Cody Beau-
champ and Frank Lee III—whether wear-
ing their suits or the tights—always had
the audience laughing. Their perfor-
mance really peaked, however, with the
show-stopping number, “Brush up Your
Shakespeare.” The audience could not
get enough of the singing and dancing
gangsters as they traded their pistols out
for hats and canes.

“For the ﬁrst few weeks a lot of what
we were doing was working with the
[dance choreographer],” Beauchamp
said. “Halfway through we started
working with the cast  it was sort of
a mirror to the show, where these two
guys just show up out of nowhere.”

Director Rob Mish said the challenge
for him was always trying to look at the
big picture.

“Not only do you have cast, crew,
music, design and lighting,” Mish said,
but “the director has to have the whole
picture and imagine what he wants on
stage and then explain it to the group.”

Mish appeared alongside Kampf last
year in the “Pirates of Penzance,” but
this was his ﬁrst time directing her.

“Working with [Lauren] is a dream,”
he said. “She takes direction really well
and brings so much to a character.”

Kampf hopes to pursue an acting
career after graduation. She said her
favorite role was Ruth in “Pirates,” but
she also would like to play Maureen
from “Rent” or any of the characters in
“Les Miserables.”

Beauchamp said his ﬁrst time on the
W&L stage made him feel like he was
joining a theater family. He said veter-
ans like Kampf and Michael Wagoner,
a senior who played the role of General
Harrison Howell, were very welcoming
to the new actors.

‘‘It is really fun,” Beauchamp said,
“to work with people who are about as
professional as you can get without get-
ting a paycheck.”

Women’s tennis wins NCAA team title

Senior Emily Applegate places second in individual singles tournament

By Mlchael Keenan
sPoRrs EDITOR

The past three years the Wash-
ington and Lee women’s tennis
team has seen incredible sea-
sons come to an end just short of
bringing home a national cham-
pionship. This year, they would
not be denied. With a 5-2 victory
over Amherst College, the team
claimed the ﬁrst women’s nation-
al championship in school history
and just the second overall.

On Tuesday, May 15th, the
Generals played their quarterﬁ-
nal match against the Panthers of
Middlebury College.

“Everyone knew what a battle
it was going to be after doubles,
and Middlebury fought hard,”
said junior Kelly Will.

“That ﬁrst match against
Middlebury was extremely tight.
Watching the match at 3-3, I
knew that we needed two more
courts to win,” said senior Ginny
Wortham.

“Off the court watching the
team was deﬁnitely nervous that
it could be our last match of the
season, but on the court I think
the last three players were very
conﬁdent and knew they were go-
ing to stay out there until we got
the last two points,” said junior
Leah Weston.

Tabb’s victory in No. 3 singles
over Emery, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, pro-
vided the point and the Generals
were through to the semiﬁnals.

“I think that match was the
toughest of the tournament. The
close victory over Middlebury
deﬁnitely motivated us for the next
two matches,” said Wortham.

The team made a point of en-
joying the experience and staying
relaxed as well.

“We would drive up to the
courts with our music blasting
and we’d be singing along and
dancing in the van,” said Will.
“We were about to play an incred-
ibly important match and here we
are being silly to ‘Glamorous’ or
‘Give It To Me.”’

In the semiﬁnals the next day,
the Generals faced the Ephs of
Williams, who had handed the
Generals their only loss of the
season.

“Losing to Williams in the
regular season was probably one
of best things that could have mo-
tivated us for that match,” said
Wortham. “When we played Wil-
liams during the regular season, I
think we came out a little ﬁat in
the doubles and never regained
our momentum into singles,” said
Wortham. “Not Wednesday.”

After sweeping the doubles
matches, sophomore Katie Tabb
and Will earned victories to end
the match, 5-0, meaning W&L
would be in the ﬁnals for the third
year in a row. This year the Gen-
erals would meet Amherst, who
defeated Sewanee 5-0 to secure

their berth in the ﬁnals.
“The atmosphere at Mary
Washington surrounding the

match was unbelievable,” said
Wortham. “There were so many
people - family and friends -
watching and cheering.”

“The team tried to look at the
championship match as just being
another match in order for us to
stay relaxed,” said Weston. “Re-
gardless, there is no denying that
playing in the ﬁnals of nationals
caused a thrilling atmosphere 0
anxiety and excitement.” «

The Generals scored the ﬁrst
point of the match when Weston
and freshman Lauren Caire de-

feated Arnherst’s duo of Jennifer
Murphy and Laura Stein at No.
3 doubles. Amherst evened the
score when Alicia Menezes and
Brittany Berckes beat Emily Ap-
plegate and Kristen McClung at
No. 1 doubles, 8-3. The Generals
took the ﬁnal point of the doubles
portion when Tabb and Wortham
defeated Katie Hudson and Jill
Wexler at no. 2 doubles, -8-5.

In singles, Will quickly de-
feated Murphy 6-0, 6-2, to give
the Generals a 3-1 lead. Soon
after, senior Emily Applegate de-
feated Menezes 6-2, 6-1, to bring
the Generals within one match of
winning the title. Though Berckes
defeated Wortham to cut the Gen-
erals lead to 4-2, soon Tabb had
match point in her No. 3 singles
match against Monica Snyder.

“I just remember realizing
that Katie Tabb had match point,
watching her win the point, and
then running on to her court,”
said Wortham. “I was in shock. I
couldn’t believe that we had won.
The victory was even more spe-
cial because we were able to share
it with our entire team, friends,
and especially our family mem-
bers who have been supporting us
since we were junior players.”

“The moment we won the
national championship was ob-
viously the best moment of that
week, and being with the team
the rest of the day and celebrat-
ing together was the best memory
of the week, and one of the best
moments of my entire life,” said
Weston.

“While I would have loved to
win the last two ﬁnals I played,
winning this year was so much
more special,” said Wortham.
“Winning a national champion-

ship has been my goal since I
started playing on the women’s
tennis team my freshman year.
Not only was it the perfect ending
to my college career, I am so glad
I could share this victory with this
special group of people. “

Applegate, Wortham, and
Tabb were chosen to play in the
individual singles tournament and
the duo of Applegate and Mc-
Clung were chosen to play in the
doubles tournament.

“The individual part of the
tournament is like a completely
new tournament,” said Wortham.

Only Applegate survived the
ﬁrst round. Tabb was defeated by
Pomona-Pitzer’s Siobhan Fini-
cane 6-2, 0-6, 1-6, Wortham fell
to Middlebury’s Amy Roche, 6-4,
3-6, 2-6, and Applegate and Mc-
Clung lost to Jordan Hook and
Karly Olson of Wheaton College
7-5, 3-6, 3-6.

ApplegatedefeatedWellesley’s
Jenna Mezin in the ﬁrst round and
rallied against The College of
New Jersey’s Jackie Shtemberg
to win 4-6,16-4, 6-4, in the second
round. The next day, Applegate
defeated Megan Tiegs of St. Bene-
dict and Wheaton’s Jordan Hook
in straight sets to advance to the
ﬁnals for the second straight year
to face top-seeded Liz Bondi of
DePauw. After losing the ﬁrst set
6-2, Applegate came back to take
tie the match with a 6-4 victory in
the second set. However, Bondi
won the third set in a tie break to
win the individual title. This was
just the sixth loss in Applegate’s
career. At W&L, Applegate won
65 matches.

The Generals will return four
of the players who competed at
nationals next year as they look to
defend their title.

Doombos shines in hep at NCAAS

Sophomore Stacy Doombos

spent last Thursday and Friday
busy in Oshkosh, Wisc., at the
2007 Track and Field Division III
NCAA Championships, compet-
ing in the Women’s Heptathlon.
Doombos ﬁnished 14"‘ in her ﬁrst
trip to Nationals.

“It was an awesome opportuni-
ty to compete here at the NCAAS
this year. I had a lot of fun. It was
more competitive obviously than
the hep[tathlon]s that I have been
competing in throughout this
year,” said Doombos alter the
meet. “Also, one main difference
was that I was not use to compet-
ing with that many competitors.
There were 18 girls competing
this year and the most I have ever

done a hep with is 8.”

Doombos competed well after
battling severe weather condi-
tions on Day 1, including wind
gusts of up to 51 miles an hour.
Doombos ran her 100m hurdles
with a 29 mile per hour wind at
her back. This helped her to run a
career best time of 15.77 seconds,
good for 743 points.

“What is really good about
this meet is that they can turn
the events around so that the ath-
letes are running with the wind to
help them,” Doombos said of her
hurdle race. “With the 100 meter
hurdles I think it really helped all
the athletes who competed to run
their best times this season.”

After the hurdles, Doombos
cleared 5’ 0.25” in the high jump,
earning her another 655 points.
Then, in the shot put, Doombos

threw just under thirty feet to earn
471 points.

The ﬁnal event on Thursday
was the 200m dash.

“The winds had actually
slowed because it started to rain
really hard,” said Doombos. i“It
would have been nice to have had
a tail wind for the 200.”

Doombos still ﬁnished strong
with a time of 25.61, good for
ﬁﬂth place, 832 points, and reset-
ting her own school record in the
event.

Friday’s ﬁrst event was the
long jump, where Doombos
placed ﬁlth by jumping 16’ 9.25”,
earning another 589 points. Next,
Doombos threw the javelin a dis-
tance of 59’ 6.25”, adding an ad-
ditional 254 points to her total.

Finally, Doombos prepared
for her 800m run, the last event in

Most college golfers would
be satisﬁed with simply making
an appearance at the four-day
National Championships at the
end of a season. Only 120 golfers
were invited to take part in the Di-

vision III event, hosted by Ander-
son University from May 15-18.
Junior Nathaniel James was the
only one from Washington and
Lee. But that honor, enough for
most golfers, didn’t satisfy James.
Despite his eventual ﬁnish, tied
for 19th, he expressed unhappi-
ness with his performance.

“I was out of sync pretty much
the whole time and was not able
to ﬁnish well on the last day,” he
said. With a top ten ﬁnish in sight,
James shot a 7-over 79 on Friday’s
fourth round and ﬁnished with a
307 for the four-day tournament,
19 strokes over par and only four
strokes out of tenth position.

Much of James’ performance
can be explained by the conditions
he faced at The Hawthoms Coun-
try Club in Fisher, Indiana. The
ﬁeld struggled with the course,
suﬁering what James called “three
days of diﬂicult conditions.” Only
champion Clinton Dammann was
under par for the tournament. '

A St. John’s won the team title,
shooting 300-300-301-303 to ﬁn-
ish at +52. Each team that won its
conference took ﬁve golfers to the
event. W&L failed to qualify as a
team because they ﬁnished second
in the ODAC tournament from
April 21st to 23rd. The victors of
that tournament, Guilford College,
ﬁnished seventh at the national
tournament. That left James as the
sole W&L golfer in the ﬁeld, which
he called “the greatest disappoint-
ment of the year... [The team was]
so close to going this year that it
was really tough to get over.” The
promising Generals squad ﬁnished
17 strokes behind Guilford in that

the heptathlon.

“I really look forward to all the
events in the hep so I just went
into [the 800] the same way I do
in all my events, I do the best I
can and try to focus on just one
event at a time,” said Doombos.

Doombos went on in the 800
to ﬁnish fourth in the event with
a time of 2:22.89, earning 785
points, bringing her ﬁnal total to
4329 points. With this total, Door-
nbos captured 14"‘ in the Nation.

“Overall the meet went well,”
said Doombos. “I had a lot of fun
and learned a lot about competing
in the hep. I am already looking
forward to next year and hope-
fully next year I will be up on the
podium. Since I was one of the
youngest girls there for the hep, I
think it just takes time to learn all
those events.”

nationals

event, though many, including
James, thought they had the talent
to win and continue on to Nation-
als.

While admittedly downtrod-
den about this May’s results,
James is already looking forward
to next season, where he hopes
to ﬁnish in the top ﬁve golfers
nationally. That would require
an improvement greater than the
one made by James over the last
twelve months. In his sophomore
year, James ﬁnished at 24-over
at the National Championships.
Placing among Division III’s most
elite is an ambitious goal simply
by virtue of the players retum-
ing for next season. Dammann is
a junior, and 12 of the 18 golfers
who ﬁnished ahead of James will
compete next year.

However, James said he is fo-
cusing on the team’s expectations
for the year ahead. “This team is
deﬁnitely one that can win [the
conference] next season. I will
be extremely disappointed if we
don’t. We have a lot of great play-
ers on our team that have been
steadily improving and maturing
over the last couple of years. I
anticipate having an extremely
competitive team next year ca-
pable of excelling at all levels of
competition.”
