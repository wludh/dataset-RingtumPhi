Police say crime rates are dropping but
warn students to keep taking precautions

By Katherine Greene
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

t was a dark, still night, so still that the absence

of sound left a vacuum the wind kept trying to

ﬁll. The woman walking down the street didn’t
notice, and she shattered the silence with her too-thin,
too-high heels, clattering over the cobblestones in a
pattern of chaotic stumbling. She didn’t notice the
three men following her. In her drunken determination
to make it home, she didn’t notice much of anything.
The men moved quickly, slinking through the shad-
ows in a quiet conspiracy, coming closer to their prey

with each stealthy stride.

The woman did not make it
home that night. She spent it in
jail.

A similar situation happened
in October--and it has the Lex-
ington Police Department wor-
ried that students are making
themselves too vulnerable to
criminals around town.

Ofﬁcer Ron Condry, who
came across the scene as it
played out one Saturday night,
arrested the woman and charged
her with underage possession
of alcohol and being drunk in
public.

She wished to remain anony-
mous until her case is heard in
court on Nov. 14.

Though the charges are seri-
ous and could result in the loss
of her license, they may have
saved her life.

The men following her, ac-
cording to police, were “just
local troublemakers, up to no
good.”

But Chief Steve Crowder
warned the members of Wash-
ington & Lee’s Inter-Fraterntiy
Council that unless students
avoid dangerous situations,
something awful is bound to
happen.

“You guys have got to be
careful,” Crowder said to the
men. v

He said that the women at
W&L are particularly vulnerable
because they feel safe enough to
walk home at night. even when
they are drunk.

“You’ve got to look out for
the girls,” Crowder said. “That’s
the way my momma raised
me.”

The woman’s arrest earlier
this month is not the only case
that has authorities on edge.

Michael Young, director

of public safety at W&L. said
that several women have been
“grabbed on the street,” but that
the incidents were never report-
ed.

Young sent out an e—mail to
W&L students on Oct. 27 wam-
ing them of “an increased pres-
ence of suspicious persons lurk-
ing on the streets.”

Since school began, a few lo-
cal residents have been arrested
and charged in incidents relat-
ing to W&L students.

One 25-year-old Lexington
man was arrested and charged
with peeping into the Massie
Street home of a student on
September 20. It was his third
offense, according to police.

One of the men following
the woman arrested by Condry
was later found by police offi-
cers. They picked him up a few
hours after the incident with the
student and arrested him. He
was charged with being drunk
in public.

But police say that students
are not always the victims.

Two men ran from the police
in two separate incidents during
Homecoming weekend. One is
a student at W&L, but the other
was an alumnus. According to
the police reports, both men
were intoxicated when they ran.

On Halloween, a man threat-
ened a police olﬁcer with a
meat cleaver in the kitchen at
the Palms.

Despite these incidents, the
crime rate in Lexington has
dropped over recent years. In
2005, the city only reported-219
crimes to the FBI, compared to
2004's 308 crimes.

Drivers for Traveller, Wash-
ington and Lee’s safe ride system,
reported multiple incidents of
abusive, inappropriate and vio-
lent behavior among students and
alumni over homecoming week-
end.

The incidents involved a
range of problems involving mul-
tiple drivers at different locations
on the Traveller circuit.

One Traveller Express driver
quit following Saturday night.
According to an e-mail sent from
Traveller advisor Ed Bulger to
Director of Public Safety Mike
Young, the driver seemed like she
“had just about had it.”

One incident Saturday night
involved a number of alumni who
refused to get off an overloaded
bus. ’

After the driver requested that
they leave, the alumni “got in her
face,” according to the incident
report.

The report said “they refused
to give their names,” and yelled
obscenities at the driver.

The driver turned off the en-
gine and exited the bus, at which
point “the alumni followed her

 

out of the bus as she walked
around it” and continued using
obscenities.

The alumni eventually got on
another bus that arrived at the
scene, leaving--according to re-
ports—the driver crying on the
sidewalk. The report noted that
“the undergrad students on the
bus apologized to [the driver] for
the behavior of the alumni.”

“It’s a sad day when under-
graduates have to apologize for
the behavior of alumni,” Bulger
said. ’ ‘

Another incident Saturday
night involved students at the
Davidson Park stop who “beat on
the side of the bus” and “threw
beer cans on the roof,” accord-
ing to the incident report. The
cans “rolled down over the wind-
shield,” forcing the driver to “tum
on the windshield wipers to clear
the windshield.”

In a separate incident from
Saturday night, a different driver
in the Red Square area had a beer
bottle “thrown at the bus she was
driving.”

The window was “fortunate-
ly. .. not open far enough” for the
bottle to hit her, although beer did
spill on the driver’s face, forcing
the bus to a brief halt.

In yet another incident Satur-
day, a driver was forced to request
security assistance after two stu-
dents got into an altercation on
the bus.

Before security arrived at the
bus, both of the students exited
the ‘vehicle. According to the in-
cident report, the students were
slapping each other.

These events prompted a
broadcast e-mail from Traveller
Chair Kaylee Hartung, co-signed
by Executive Committee Chair
Rob Rain and Student Judicial
Council Chair Matt Krieg, in
which Hartung labeled the behav-
ior “unacceptable.”

“If this kind of behavior con-
tinues, we risk losing our contract
with our carrier and the program
could be terminated,” Hartung
wrote.

In an interview, Hartung said
she was overwhelmed when she
received the incident reports.

“Traveller is not an entitle-
ment,” she said.

“There comes a point when al-
cohol is not an excuse. There is
no excuse for behavior like that.”

Hartung said that while she
understood the frustrations in-
volved in getting rides when the
buses are ﬁlled to capacity,

 takes a hit

Frat takes strike instead of turning in brothers

By Alden Wicker
STAFF WRITER

The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fra-
ternity showed where its loyal-
ties lie when it took a house-wide
strike instead of turning in several
brothers for marijuana use in the
beginning of October.

Just before 6 pm. on Sept. 27,
security ofﬁcer Daniel Rexrode
was doing his usual rounds be-
tween fraternity houses, according
to his report. As he walked toward
SAE, he noticed some brothers on
the third ﬂoor porch, if -

“Hey, guys, ‘security is com-
ing,” Rexrode heard someone
say. Interest piqued, he entered
the house and started walking

upstairs to the third ﬂoor. At that "

point, he reported that 15 to 20

people came “running”_down the .

stairs. That’s when Rexrode be-'
came suspicious.

Rexrode decided to investigate
further when he smelled what he
suspected was marijuana. He
talked to SAE President Jordan
Wesley but was unable to get a
satisfactory answer.

Wesley says that at that point,
Rexrode “put on his glasses and
looked around the computer
room.”

The security guard’s suspi-
cions (were conﬁrmed when he
saw a”few ﬂakes of marijuana on
the counter.

That was enough. Rexrode
wrote up a report charging SAE
with possession and use of mari-
juana, an offense punishable by
a strike from the Inter-Fratemity
Council.

Wesley talked to Campus
Security Director Mike Young,
IFC Senior Justice David Mitch-
ell, and Student Judicial Council
Chair Matt Krieg. “Everyone told
me that it wasn’t gonna be a prob-
lem,” Wesley said.

Wesley said he understood that
he would be allowed to handle the
matter internally.

“Part of the deal I struck was
that I would do an internal inves-
tigation,” said Wesley. “I asked
people involved to come forward.
I told them I wouldn’t release

their names.”

Several people came forward
to Wesley, expecting to receive a
punishment from just the frater-
nity.

“Then the IFC took charge,”
Wesley said.

The issue went to the IFC,
which gave the house a strike,
despite Wesley’s ﬁght to keep the
matter internal.

“I don’t [think it’s fair]” he
said. “I understand that they have
to follow policy, but the way that
it was handled, the information I
understood was that it wasn’t go-
ing to be a problem.”

What doesn’t bother Wesley is
the fact that the whole fraternity
had to take the fall for a few in-
dividuals.

“People did come forward
under the impression that their
names would be kept conﬁden-
tial.” Wesley said. “I gave them
my word. I decided that it was the
best thing to do. They trusted me
so I kept it secret.”

“The brothers look to me to
stick up for them,” he said.

SAE sophomore Reiss Eagan
echoed that opinion.

“I think the frat did the right
thing in stepping up,” Eagan said,
“because multiple people might
have been involved.”

As a result, SAE had two
weeks of social probation, lasting
from Oct. 3 to Oct. 20. They had
to postpone their annual toga par-
ty, along with other events, such
Thursday nights at Hooterville.

The house also had to pay a
$500 ﬁne and will have a strike
for a calendar year. Letters will
also be sent to the national head-
quarters and to their parents.

Now the SAE’s just seem ea-
ger to put the repercussions be-
hind them, and look forward to
the weeks ahead when they will
be able to party again.

“I’m glad it is ﬁnally over and
we can move on,” said Wesley.

It is not the punishment im-
posed by the IFC that really wor-
ries members, though.

It is their image they are con-
cerned with.

“It’s not good for our reputa-

as

tion, said Eagan. “It looks ir-
responsible. People might look
down on us.”

“It’s kind of embarrassing for
me,” Wesley said. “You’re doing
a good job, the fraternity is run-
ning smoothly and all the sudden
something like that happens and it
stains your reputation.”

Director of Student Activities
and Greek Life Jason Rodocker
said Wesley did a good job han-
dling the situation. Rodocker said
he was impressed with how Wes-
ley behaved.

“I think that Jordan Wesley

“The information I
understood was that

it wasn ’t going to be a

5

problem. ’

JORDAN WESLEY, SAE
Presldent _
 
and all the members of SAE did
a great job of meeting to discuss
the issue, of taking the issue se-
riously, accepting the decision of
the IFC and moving forward,” he
said. “They were very coopera-
tive.”

Rodocker points out that all
those steps are important in mak-
ing the process run smoothly.

Eagan was also happy with the
way his fraternity president acted
on the issue.

“He was very controlled about
the whole situation. He handled it
very well.”

One of the biggest issues for
SAE will be how the incident af-
fects fall rush.

“I think it has hurt rush,” Ea-
gan said, “because people might
look at us differently, with the
fact that we have a strike. Hope-
fully it will pan out.”

However, Wesley is more op-
timistic. “If anything, it’s helped
us, because we saved money. We
have some exciting weeks com-
ing up, with all the parties we will
be having.”

Traveller is still bound by
Virginia laws that prohibit over-
crowding.

“If it were up to me, I’d pack
them in there,” said Hartung.

In separate interviews, both
Hartung and Bulger raised the
possibility that Traveller might be

shut down if incidents like those]

on Homecoming weekend con-
tinue. _

“This program is at the mercy
of the students,” said Hartung.

She believes it would become
probable that the company who
runs the buses, A Goff Limos,
might not continue their char-
ter with Traveller if the situation
continues.

Bulger placed the responsi-
bility for change squarely on the
students.

“There are a few in the W&L
community who are ruining it for
everyone,” he said.

“[The problem] can only be
solved through peer pressure...
when students decided they want
this program and will stick up for
it and defend it,” Bulger said.

Otherwise, said Bulger, W&L’s
students could lose Traveller.

“That would be such a sad
day,” says Hartung. “I shudder to
think about it.”

Number of students recorded as
transported by Traveller:

The Traveller sober ride system has been under increasing
strain as demand for rides increased this year. Dispatch
runs every night. The buses run three times a week.

Campaigns call
for student help

While YD runs voter registration drives, other
students get ready for 2008 Mock Convention

Bywes O’Dell
STAFF WRITER

For some students, the
approaching November elec-
tions represent more than an
abstract political contest. For
those who donate their time
and talents toward their pre-
ferred candidate’s campaign,
it’s a labor of love.

For Senior David Mitchell,
“labor” is the operative word;
he spent the summer in a paid
position with the campaign of
Mike Beebe (D), Arkansas’s
current Attorney General and,
according to Mitchell, its next
governor. He has a knack for
picking winners: he previous-
ly worked on the campaigns
of victorious Sen. Mary Pryor
(D-AR) and Rep. Vic Snyder
(D-AR).

On the Beebe campaign
this summer, Mitchell’s re-
sponsibilities included orga-
nizing and recruiting volun-
teers to operate phone banks,
canvassing, and attending
campaign events. He also co-
ordinated the statewide yard
sign distribution plan.

“I knew that I wanted to be
involved in any capacity pos-
sible,” said Mitchell, an active
member and former president
of the Young Democrats.

The opportunity to get in-
volved attracts many students
to the College Republicans
and the Young Democrats;
both organizations campaign
actively throughout the year.
Current YD president Adam
Hockensmith points to voter
registration drives his group
has conducted this year with
Delta Sigma Theta, Alpha Phi

“YD has promoted phoning for Jim Webb
and has helped organize  a fundraiser for‘
Webb in late September ”

ADAM HOCKENSMITH, Presldent of Young Democrats

State Chairs are responsible
for a plethora of activities, in-
cluding fundraising and man-
aging research teams. They
will all “be very involved in
the politics of ’08,” said Lit-
tle.

Despite widespread inter-
est in Mock Con, veteran cam-
paigner Mitchell agrees that
many students miss out on the
regular political process

“So much is demanded of
W&L students both academi-
cally and socially,” he said. “I
would guess that [many stu-
dents] simply don’t feel like
they have enough time.”

But all the student politi-
cal organizations—College
Republicans, Young Demo-
crats, and Mock Con—have
big plans in the works to in-
crease participation. YD and
CR are planning for a debate
during the Mock Con Kickoﬂ‘
festivities, while Little and his
associates are working hard to
deliver another successful, ac-
curate, and memorable Mock
Con.

With elections looming
large in the minds of a few,
these student organizations
continue to work to expand
participation—and to ensure
the victory of the candidate of
their choice.

Alpha, and the Gay-Straight Al-
liance as particularly valuable
contributions to the campus.

Hockensmith says his orga-
nization has put a great deal of
effort into the Virginia senate
seat race.

“YD has promoted phoning
for Jim Webb and has helped
organize both a fundraiser for
Webb in late September and a
Students for Webb branch,” he
said.

Despite such efforts, Hock-
ensmith laments the lack of par-
ticipation in the process by the
majority of students.

“I would say that the students
here are very knowledgeable
about politics  Ijust wish that
this knowledge translated into
action more often,” he said. “I
believe that our campus could
be more politically involved, es-
pecially during election years--
and not just by participating in
Mock Convention.”

Mock Con remains the big-
gest political event on campus,
overshadowing even real-life
midterm elections of national
importance. The preparations
for the 2008 convention are al-
ready in full swing; Mock Con
Tri-Chair Wesley Little reports
that over 150 people attended
an information session for po-
tential State Chairs last week.

THE RING-VIII PM

Doctor calls for action

W&L health center and local doctor worry about possible ﬂu pandemic

By Nlcole Mooradlan
surr WRITER

Local authorities have begun
talking about a new threat: pan-
demic ﬂu. Not a “regrlar” ﬂu
virus, experts say the pandemic
virus will form when a human
inﬂuenza virus combines with an
avian inﬂuenza virus.

In addition to their usual ﬂu
advice, some doctors are recom-
mending that, in case of a pan-
demic, everyone stock up on N95
standard surgical masks. These
masks can keep viral particles

.from entering someone’s mouth

or nose.

Dr. Fred F evrier is one of those
doctors.

He recently presented his pan-
demic ﬂu recommendations at
the Rockbridge County Library
as well as a Rockbridge County

i Board of Supervisors meeting.

“You ought to buy some N95
masks,” he told the Rockbridge
County Supervisors. “I recom-
mend it strongly.”

N95 masks are designed to
prevent viral particles from enter-
'ng a person’s respiratory system.
Since the size of the initial dose
of the virus 'deterrnines how sick
someone will get, Fevrier be-
lieves that wearing a mask will
lessen the severity of or prevent

    

I

      

     
   
  

   

the ﬂu.

“It’s the single most and only
technological advantage that we
have [to produce] some degree of
protection over what the people
in 1918 had,” he said, referring to
the 1918 inﬂuenza pandemic.

Still, the Center for Disease
Prevention and Control (CDC)
only recommends masks for those
who work in health-care settings.
F evrier disagrees.

“It is ill-advised of the CDC to
not have recommended the use of
the mask to the public,” he said.
“I would personally opt to wear a
mask.”

The Student Health Center
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has begun to stock the masks.
According to Dr. Jane Horton,
health center employees have just
completed “ﬁt testing” for N95
masks.

Fit testing involves pumping a

foul tasting and smelling gas into
a hood the tester is wearing. First,
the person wears the hood with-
out the mask, before wearing the
hood with the mask. If the person
can smell or taste the gas while
wearing the mask, the mask does
not ﬁt.

“An N95 mask that doesn’t fit
is no more effective than a surgi-
cal mask,” Horton said.

She also does not see the need
for students to go out and buy
N95 masks. If absolutely neces-
sary, a regular surgical mask will
work.

“I don’t see [stockpiling N95
masks] as an effective use of re-
sources,” she said.

Fitting the entire campus with
N95 or surgical masks is not high
on the campus agenda. Instead of
worrying about a possible pan-
demic ﬂu, Horton thinks students
should focus on avoiding the sea-

how to protect yourself:
-Avoid close contact with people who are infected

- Get adequate rest
- Eat a healthy diet

-Always wash your hands

sonal flu.

“I would strongly encourage
anyone to get a ﬂu shot,” she said,
noting that ﬂu vaccinations have
already been proven to be effec-
tive. “Seasonal ﬂu will happen
this year, here.”

To prevent the seasonal ﬂu,
Horton encourages ill students to
practice “respiratory etiquette”
— covering a cough, staying more
than three feet away from other
people, and washing hands fre-
quently.

“If you could do only one
thing, hand hygiene would be the
most important,” she said.

Horton emphasized that stu-
dents should also take care of
their bodies by getting adequate
rest, eating a healthy diet, not
overdoing alcohol, and taking
multivitamins.

She also appeared to under-
stand the stress students are un-
der, and encouraged them to stay
healthy because “losing a week of
school can be deadly.”

The health center will receive
its next ﬂu shot shipment in the
middle of November, and notices
will be sent to the student body.

If students do not want to wait
until the health center vaccines
come in, Stonewall Jackson Hos-
pital will hold a drive-through ﬂu
clinic on Nov. 11.

Police gall for
more vigilance

crimes reported were
violent.

Still, police want citi-
zens to be aware.

Oﬂicer Nathan Kes-
terson said that the city
is lucky to have avoided
any major crimes in recent
years.

“It’s a double-edged
sword,” he said of the
numbers. “There are a lot
of things that happen that
aren’t reported,” he said.

Kesterson also said that
the low numbers might
lead to unsafe behaviors.

“People get a sense of
comfort,” he said.

Miller said that students
were not doing enough to
protect themselves.

“As vigilant as I’d
like to say you are, you
aren’t,” Miller said of the
students.

Miller said that the
students’ behavior would
eventually lead to disaster.
He said that students have

a “mentality that’s not go-
ing to change until some-
thing really bad happens.”

Young said that the hon-
or system keeps the crime
rate low, at least on cam-
pus.

He also said the close
environment of campus
should help promote safety,
but that it doesn’t always
work that way.

“We pretend to have a
family atmosphere here,”
he said, “but we need to
generally care more about
each other——it’s our jo .”

The small atmosphere
may give students a false
sense of safety.

Crowder said that de-
spite the lower crime rates,
citizens still need to be on
the lookout for danger.

“We can’t leave people
with the though that they
don’t have to still be cau-
tious,” Crowder said.

“Even though itfs a safe
community, we still have to

keep our guard up.”

Laundry code violations  

Basic laundry room rules: borrow detergent infrequently, try not to snzﬁ‘ everyone is rain-fresh dryer sheets

By Grace Andrews

c 0 L U M N I ST
oday’s topic is one of my
favorites: laundry room
etiquette.

Once again, I must place a
disclaimer here. What I am about

‘ to say may apply to you, but that

is not to offend anyone, solely to

3‘ enlighten.

Around two weeks ago, I was
in the laundry room located in
Gilliam when I was not only a
victim, but also a witness to bad

. laundry room etiquette.

To begin, my roommate and I

,' had loaded our laundry in an al-

most vacant laundry room. There
were a handful of open washing
machines, and since it was almost

I ll p.m., we weren’t too worried
about having any laundering
' problems. Boy, were we wrong!

After getting too involved in
an episode of “Veronica Mars,”

I my roomie and I returned to the

laundry room about twenty min-
utes after our clothes had ﬁnished

. washing. On our way there, we

both laughed at how funny it

it would be if someone had removed

our clothes to use our washers.
When we entered the laun-

' dry room, we were shocked (by

shocked, I mean a little upset in
our spirits) to ﬁnd that our clothes
were located outside of the safety
and warmth of a Washington and

the one next to it. Not only were
the clothes located on top of the
machine, but the machine was be-
ing used by someone else.

I couldn’t help but laugh dur-
ing that moment. I could not be-
lieve it. There, on top of the coun-
ter were my brightly polka-dotted
undergarments for all the world
to see.

No, seriously, my undergar-
ments were on top of my pile of
clothes.

To make matters worse, there
were two young men in there who
had the pleasure of watching me
try to conceal my intimates. To
make matters worse, the young
man who had hijacked our wash-
ers suddenly walked into the
laundry room.

I could not believe my eyes.
The washer-watcher walked in
whistling and shufﬂing his little
machine-stealing feet while I
gave him my ﬁre-starting glare
(which he did not notice).

The thought of this total
stranger taking my unmention-
ables out of the washer made me a
little uncomfortable. What he did
next truly disturbed me.

The dryer door-opener pro-
ceeded to open dryers that were
currently in use, for what reasons
I ’m not sure of, and close the doors
without restarting them. Then, he
removed clothes from a recently

ﬁnished dryer to use. When I say. .

This Bounce snzﬂer smelled the
sheets so hard, I thought they
might lose their freshness.

 

various dryer sheet brands sniff-
ing and “borrowing” sheets.

When I say sniﬁing, I mean
snifﬁng. This Bounce sniffer
smelled the sheets so hard; I
thought they might lose their
freshness.

Now, I’m not sure if this laun-
dry room renegade ever returned
any of these sheets or not, but I
thought it was a bit bold to be so
picky. I think the saying goes,
“beggars can’t be choosers.”

After undetectably observing
this clear and disturbing viola-
tion of laundry room etiquette, I
quickly set my cell phone alarm
for approximately one hour. I was
stricken with a fear of coming in
and ﬁnding my clothes placed
upon some unclean surface.

As I walked home, I wondered
if ‘ole Sir Snifﬁs-a-lot had “bor-
rowed” some detergent too, and
how picky he had been. You see.
common sense would tell you
that if you do decide to “borrow”

detergent from someone. you

too. It is one that I was a Victim
of so many times last year that I
went through a bottle of detergent
and Shout per month, even though
I only did about ﬁve loads in that
time period.

I quickly got hip to the jive
(yes, I just used that line, and no.
you’re not seeing things) and took
my washing aides to my room.

The irony of the situation was
that on my way home, I acciden-
tally took an unnamed bottle of
Shout that I thought was mine.
However, when I realized it
wasn’t mine, I screamed loudly (I
thought I had committed an acci-
dental honor code violation) and
ran back to the laundry room to
return it.

As much as I wanted to judge
the washer-watching Bounce
sniffer, I realized that I was just
as guilty as him of violating good
laundry room etiquette.

Last year, my roommate and
I “accidentally" took so many
socks that we could have socked

when I asked my roommate to
get my things out of the dryer for
me. She returned with about three
new t-shirts and some more socks
(surprise. surprise).

The problem in that situation
was that I didn’t fold my clothes
for several days, and it was right
before a break. Thus, when I no-
ticed strange un-Grace like items

‘in my basket, it was already too

late.

Even though I took the stuff
back. folded and fresh, and placed
them on a clean surface, no one
ever retrieved the items, and they
became property of the laundry
room.

I think that is why there are so
many clothing items on the ﬂoor
- people don’t know what’s theirs
and what is not. Out of fear of
committing an honor code viola-
tion. they just leave the stuff on
the ground or counter and walk
away.

Iloncstly though, who’s going
to pick up their underpants off of
:1 Iinty ground after several days?
TIiat‘s right, not me. Short of
the monifying idea of having to
do that in front of people I don’t
know. I bet the clothes aren’t as
clean anymore.

I‘m not saying that people
shouldn‘t take a washer or dryer
that they need or “borrow” deter-
gent and dryer sheets when they
an: running low. but there should

In my public laundering opin-
ion, I think that you should give
everyone thirty-minutes to come
and get their stuff. You never
know if the owner of the items
you want to remove is doing
something important, such as a
take home test or watching “Ve-
ronica Mars 

Nonetheless, I must say that I
hate when people just leave their
clothes in washers or dryers for
hours and never pick them up.
I know that I personally have
friends who will put their stuﬁ in
the dryer at some god-forsaken
hour (during the night that is) and
return the next day to pick them
up.
I don’t advise doing that, espe-
cially since if this method is ap-
plied to the washer, you may have
some strange bacterial culture
growing on your favorite t-shirt
and trying to befriend the lint on
your towel.

However, if you are in a hurry
and cannot wait, please be kind
enough to place the clothes on
a clean surface and conceal any
items that may be deemed em-
barrassing for others to see. Also,
don’t go around taking only the
rain-shower fresh dryer sheets
and leaving the tropical-mist ones
in the discarded scents pile. The
tropical-mist sheets have feelings
too.

Student apathy
on election day

Why college kids will stay home from the polls

America goes to the polls
Tuesday.

Students at Washington
and Lee will be doing lots of
things that day: sleeping off
hangovers, catching up on
homework, and spending time
with friends in the Co-op.

Most of them will not be
voting. And the vast major-
ity of other college students
around the county will do the
same thing.

This fact may disappoint
parents and the politics de-
partment.

But really, why should
Virginia college students care
about what Senate candidate
Jim Webb wrote 25 years
ago?

So he put some sex into his
novels. Sexually explicit pas-
sages in a novel probably are
not going to bother your typi-
cal W&L student. Sorry, we
just do not shock as easily as
the average 50-year-old voter
does.

Even if college students
cared about the issues, a vi-
cious year of mud-slinging in
-almost every close race has
completely obscured the true
nature of each candidate.

Few Virginia residents
know how the senate candi-

dates feel about expanding
I-81.

But almost everyone
knows by now that George
Allen called one of Webb's
staffers a “macaca.” Nearly
all the voters know that Webb
once argued that women
should not be allowed into the
Naval Academy.

These incidents — whether
recent or decades-old — might
tell voters something about the
character of each man. But do
they offer a compelling reason
for a Virginia college student
to head for the polls?

That does not mean there
are no issues of interest to
students. But since students
rarely vote, candidates see no
point in talking about these is-
sues.

Consider the rising cost of
college education. W&L stu-
dents may not have to worry
about this themselves, but
many of their parents certain-
ly do.

The federal government
provides Pell Grants to help
low-income students attend
colleges. In recent years
the government has chosen
to give _more grants but less
money per grant.

When is the last time Allen

and Webb — or any national
candidates for that matter
— took up the issue? Finan-
cial aid is something many
students and their parents care
about. But candidates from
both parties would rather
squabble over “values” issues
like abortion and gay mar-
riage.

Too bad a college educa-
tion is not considered valu-
able enough to talk about.

If students are not worried
about college prices, perhaps
the war in Iraq might concern
them.

Regardless of personal
opinions, every student should
realize that the new Congress
will shape America’s policy
on Iraq.

This is the last chance vot-
ers will have before 2008 to
decide how the United States
will light this war.

Want the United States to
keep troops in Iraq indeﬁnite-
ly? Or do you want American
troops to leave Iraq in the next
year? The new Congress will
be deciding that.

America goes to the polls
Tuesday. Even if we do not
go, perhaps we should know
what the voters are deciding
without us.

Traveller driver
abuse intolerable

Homecoming weekend harassment an isolated incident

By Abel S. Delgado
c o L u M N IST

Last Wednesday, I was the
quintessential Washington and
Lee student. I woke up early to
study. I went to class, read, read,
and read some more. After dinner
I went to a club meeting where
religion, philosophy, and social
life were openly and respectﬁxlly
discussed. I

Then I got on a bus ﬁlled with
fully inebriated people and partied
until it was no longer Wednesday.

They call it Traveller, and as
we might be reminded of soon,
it is a privilege, not a right. As
nearly everyone I know would ar-
gue, Traveller is an integral part
of campus life.

I’ll admit, being a student that
openly abstains from getting in-
toxicated and likes his parties
close to the dorm, I don’t use
Traveller much. But after hear-
ing what happened homecoming
weekend, my curiosity got the
best of me.

For those of you who haven’t
heard, during homecoming week-
end, numerous students and alurn—
ni harassed, verbally abused, and
even assaulted Traveller drivers
with beer cans. One driver quit
following an incident.

Frankly, this came to me as lit-
tle surprise. It’s always bothered
me that a community that can be
so gentlemanly and ladylike by
day could ﬂip the switch and by
night forget how to act with the
help of a few drinks, from a trash
can of course.

It’s something about this cam-

Those who act like jerks, whether
drunk or sober, should get the mes-
sage: we don ’t want you.

pus that everyone knows but no
one likes to talk about, or at least
not with authority ﬁgures. Stu-
dents get drunk on a regular basis
and many aren’t 21. No Alco-
ho1Edu or subsequent programs
have or will stop this.

But as I was reminded Wednes-
day night, homecoming was not
a case of students being drunk.
This was a case of students being
jerks.

“Even if I were plastered, like
I am right now,” one student said
on a bus ride, “I wouldn’t do that
s-. Whoever did that was an a- be-
fore he got drunk.”

On that bus ride I heard vari-
ous students talk about why R.L.
Stine was a better author than C.S.
Lewis, why raising cheetahs after
retirement would be fun, and why
the word hypothesis is so difficult
to pronounce.

On a second ride, my friend,
who was in a state our genera-
tion would call “tipsy,” and I dis-
cussed health care, education, and
the need for Traveller on every
campus.

On both these rides, every
single person getting off the bus
would ﬁrst say thank you to the
driver, whether they were drunk
or sober. Many others would make
conversations with the driver, and

still others would apologize for
the actions that were commit-
ted on homecoming weekend by
other students. Although I hadn’t
seen them drink, most of these
people seemed to be drunk. None
of them were jerks.

Traveller has become such an
important part of campus life that
we couldn’t stop talking about
what happened homecoming
weekend. People were upset and
with good reason.

And worse yet, they were wor-
ried what would happen if there
were no longer a Traveller bus
system. Campus life as we know
it would have to’ be changed dra-
matically. The party habits many
of us have would not be sustain-
able. I’m not even going to talk
about how many lives would be
put in dangerous situations on a
regular basis without Traveller.

I’m not going to condone or
condemn those who drink more
than they should. That’s their call,
and as long as they don’t hurt
anyone in the process, then I’ll
live and let live.

But those who act like jerks,
whether verbally or physically,
whether drunk or sober, should
get the message: we don’t want
you on our campus.

We want Traveller.

No excuse for Limbaugh

Medicated Fox not playing up Parkinson is shakes for stem cell research

By Cody Beauchamp
c o LU M N I sr

Rush ‘Limbaugh just might
be the most callous idiot alive. I
don’t care how conservative you
are. There’s absolutely no excuse
for his recent attacks on Michael
J. Fox.

In case you hadn’t heard, a
brief introduction:

Fox, who has had Parkinson’s
disease for 15 years now, recently
ﬁlmed a series of television ads
encouraging people to vote for
Clair McCaskill and Ben Cardin,
Democrats running for the Senate
in toss-up races in Missouri and
Maryland, respectively.

McCaskill and Cardin both
support stem cell research, while
their opponents, Jim Talent and
Michael Steele, don’t.

In the ads,‘Fox, shaking and
clearly having trouble control-
ling his movements, pleads that
people vote for McCaskill and
Cardin in the hopes that they
would use their offices to support
the research, which Fox said “of—
fers hope to millions of Ameri-
cans with diseases like diabetes,
Alzheimer ’s and Parkinson’s.”

Enter Rush Limbaugh, stage
(extreme political) right.

On the Oct. 23 broadcast of
his conservative radio talk show,
Limbaugh charged that Fox was
acting during the television spots.

“In this commercial, he is
exaggerating the effects of the
disease,” said Limbaugh. “He is
moving all around and shaking.
And it’s purely an act.... Either he
didn’t take his medication or he’s

As dying men and women, Parkin-
son ’s sufferers absolutely deserve to
hope and work for a cure.

 

acting, one of the two.”

Limbaugh even had the brass
ones to call Fox “shameless” for
doing the spots.

Limbaugh based a large part
of his charge that Fox purposely
wasn’t taking his medications on
what Fox actually did while tes-
tifying before a Senate subcom-
mittee examining Parkinson’s’
effects in 1998.

In his autobiography, Fox ex-
plained that the reason he chose
to testify without medication was
because “it seemed to me that this
occasion demanded that my testi-
mony about the effects of the dis-
ease... be seen as well as hear .”

Let’s get one thing straight-—
Michael J. Fox IS an actor. And
he has done some ﬁne acting be-
cause of his Parkinson’s.

But the acting I’m talking
about is the acting he did for years
to hide his disease, not to exag-
gerate it.

Anyone familiar with Fox’s
personal story knows that for
years he did everything in his
power to hide his disease from
the public.

From 1991 to 1998, Fox was
very much in the public eye
thanks to the success of his sit-
com “Spin City.”

. He gave what may be the
performance of a lifetime-—he
hid from the world that he has a
disease with symptoms that are
almost impossible to hide.

To Fox, the person he was in
public, the man who did not have
an incurable disease, was the act.

The man who could barely
control his movements, who
shook and bounced all over, was
the real person.

When Limbaugh attacked Fox
for “exaggerating the effects” of
Parkinson’s, he was confusing
something. Fox. wasn’t being an
actor.

He was being himself.

People afflicted with Parkin-
son’s really do behave like that,
even medicated.

I should know—for the last
5 years of his life, I watched my
grandfather die of Parkinson’s.

I watched him shake uncon-
trollably even with medication. I
watched him become bed-stricken
because of loss of muscle control.
I watched my mother tear up when
her father couldn’t even recognize
her because of the memory loss
that afflicts Parkinson’s sufferers
in the last stages of the disease. I
watched my grandmother cry at
his funeral.

As dying men and women,
Parkinson’s sufferers absolutely
deserve to hope and work for a
cure. '

That’s what Fox is doing by
promoting stem cell research and
those elected oﬂicials who also
support it.

Stem cell research is a contro-
versial issue for very good rea-
sons.

People have the right to decide
where they stand on the issue. But
before they decide to oppose it
on account of their morals, they
had damn well better look into
the eyes of someone dying from a
disease it can potentially cure.

If you can do that and still be
against stem cell research, ﬁne.

Even after watching my grand-

father die, I don’t support it. And ’

that’s a perfectly justiﬁable deci-
sion.

But to do what Limbaugh did
and accuse these dying people of
“acting” and playing up the real
effects of their diseases is not jus-
tiﬁable.

Even if they do go without
medication to show the full ef-
fects of their aﬂlictions (which
Fox says he didn’t do for the
political spots), they are still not
acting.

Even if you don’t agree with
them, people like Fox still de-
serve to be treated honestly. They
still deserve respect should they
decide to let the realities of their
diseases be seen.

Otherwise, you are being as ig-
norant and callous as Limbaugh.

And that's what’s really
shameless.

In return, all the proceeds of
the carnival went to the Rock-
bridge Young Life ministry.

I Travis and Dargahi said they I

were pleased by the event’s
turnout. -

1 “I think everything went very
well,” they said. I am excited to
see that so many Greek organi-
zations showed up. I’d say that’s
success in itself.”

Each sorority and fraternity

was assigned a certain booth,
which they set up and managed
during the day. I

A variety of different games
and activities were provided
such as musical chairs, face
painting, putt-putt and pumpkin
painting.

Kappa Kappa Gamma Phi,-
lanthropy Chair Brooke Segod-
nia was in charge of the treasure
chest booth, which was a popu-
lar activity among the younger
children.

Segodnia spoke positive yv
. about the event.

“It was nice for once to fo-
cus on something besides scho
work and W&L social events. ’
she said. “I enjoyed doing sonic-
thing good for the community.”

W&L students were not thk
only ones enjoying themselves.
Eight-year—old Brianna Sears
was very enthusiastic about the
carnival.

“This year is deﬁnitely better
than last year,” Sears said. “My
favorite is the dunking booth. I
hit the mark three times because
I’m a girl, and girls rule.”

Last Saturday’s carnival was
followed by another on Monday
night at the Natural Bridge Ju-

venile Correction Center.

NBJCC is a more relaxed
prison for juveniles who have
proved themselves responsiblr
at other facilities. .

It has no walls and provid
education and discipline lessor
for its inmates.

V At the carnival, cadets were"

able to relax and enjoy the holi-
day by participating in activities

that are not usually allowed.

“It’s kind of like a reward for
good behavior,” said sophomore
Kelly Bundy.

“The guys work hard in their
classes and on jobs they are as-
signed, and this gives them a
chance to kind of unwind.”

Bundy thought the cadets
responded well to Volunteer of-
forts.

“It was awesome” said Bun-
dy. “All the cadets loved it.
They had a great time, and they
were very appreciative.” A

This event has inspired many
students to further their connec-
tion with NBJCC.

Students can volunteer dur-
ing the day at this facility as tu-
tors for the GED test.

“A lot of the volunteers want
to start tutoring there now be-
cause the carnival made them
realize what a great place it is,”
said Bundy.

The activities continued with
student participation at a Hal-
loween festival at Efﬁnger El-
ementary School.

Also-, students interacted
with young children in costume
as they trick-or-treated in Bak-
er—Davis-Gilliam Quad.

Volunteers also dedicated
their time at a Haunted House at
Rockbridge County library.

Boss said these activities
helped broaden her perspective
and reach out to community
members.

Boss said: “It’s nice to get
out of the W&L bubble and see
what else is happening in Lex-
ington.”

Arts expand to new hall

University dedicates Wilson Hall to former president, celebrates ﬁne arts education, excellence

By Dane Davls
surr WRITER

The brand new Wilson Hall
was oﬁicially dedicated to John
and Anne Wilson this Saturday.
The dedication ceremony cel-
ebrated the rich and long tradition
of musical excellence at Wash-
ington and Lee University. ‘

The night began with Philip
Norwood, Rector of the Board of
Trustees, welcoming the guests
and detailed all of the work, sup-
port, and time that went into the
construction of Wilson Hall.

Rector Norwood then pre-
sented President Ruscio with the
“key” to Wilson Hall, which was
an oversized swipe card.

After receiving the key to Wil-
son Hall, President Ruscio spoke
on the importance of music and
art to a liberal arts education. He
emphasized that despite W&L’s
small size, it has accomplished
great achievements in the ﬁeld of
music.

President Ruscio then intro-
duced John Wilson, the honoree
of the night. Mr. Wilson rhetori-
cally asked the audience: “What
is it, as alumni, that draws us back
to this place?”

Although regretting that there
were not one thousand vocalists
to sing Mahler’s eighth sympho-

any, Mr. Wilson was nevertheless
;impressed at the quality and skill
iof the University’s musical edu-

cation.

After a short introduction by
Professor Timothy Gaylord, the
night’s spectacular musical per-
formance began.

In addition to a piece writ-
ten by Professor Terry Vosbein
entitled “Music’s Empire,” two
other. musical selections were
performed as a tribute to Wilson’s
appreciation of Irish culture and
Gustav Mahler.

The University Chorus and
Chamber Singers sang the excit-
ing and vibrant “Music ’s Empire”
with music by Terry Vosbein and
text by Andrew Marvell.

The traditional Irish anthem,
“Danny Boy,” was conducted by
Gordon Spice and sung by The
University Chamber Singers. The
night concluded with the Finale
from Gustav Mahler’s “Sympho-
ny No. 2.”

It was a night of celebration,
because not only does Washing-
ton and Lee have a new hall, it
also has the talent to ﬁll the cor-
ridors of the hall with vibrance
and beauty.

A piano instrument major of
Washington and Lee’s music
program, Shu Gao, summarized
the excellence of the Fine Arts
department when she said, “I am
a music major because it is en-
joyable and fun. Plus, the music
major department is very small,
so [you] get personal attention
which is necessary to excel as a

musician.”

The idea for a new building
for the ﬁne arts department arose
shortly after the construction of
Lenfest Center. Dupont Hall, built
in 1953, could no longer ﬁll the
needs of the University’s growing
ﬁne arts department.

W&L reached out to its alumni
base for the development of a new
building, which together with
Lenfest would, house all of the
W&L’s ﬁne arts. The architecture
ﬁrm,’Zimmer, Gunsul, and Fras-
ca, and the construction company,
Brice Building Company of Bir-
mingham, both had alumni ties to
W&L.

As the building began to take
shape, unexpected budget costs
forced W&L to again turn to its
alumni base. The alumni, includ-
ing the Lenfest family, were more
than happy to give, under one
condition: the hall be named after
one of W&L’s most distinguished

presidents, John D. Wilson.

Wilson, who served as W&L’s
president from 1983 to 1995,
and his wife Anne Wilson, both
showed a love for music that con-
tinues to shape the University.

The completed hall now has
a state of the an auditorium with
excellent acoustics, studios and
classrooms. The roomy 65,000
square-foot building will give
current and future W&L students
the space they need to achieve
their artistic potential.

SA|Lfundraises
for Sudan crisis

Karaoke, talent Show fund relief eﬂorts for refugees

By Jessica Shaw
ARTS AND LIFE canon

Villages are bombed. Civil-
ians are killed. Women are raped.
Children are maimed.

These atrocious acts are oc-
curring daily in the Aﬁican nation
of Sudan. Hundreds of thousands
of Sudanese civilians have been
killed by an Arab militia in a com-
plex ethnic and religious power
struggle.

While the United Nations re-
fuses to deﬁne this as genocide,
the conﬂict persists. Several
Washington & Lee students have
made it their mission to make a
difference in this crisis.

The Student Association for
lntemational Learning (SAIL)
strives to introduce the student
body to cultural issues outside of
its boundaries. It also seeks to aid
others in times of natural disaster
or national turmoil, according to
lntemational Development and
Relief Group co-Chair sopho-
more Liza Njuguna.

Sophomores Grace Andrews
and Njuguna represent SAIL at
W&L. They have organized sev-
eral fundraisers to both contribute
funds to Sudan relief as well as
promote awareness of this crisis
around campus.

Money gained from these
fundraisers will be donated to
the CARE foundation, whichis
working out of Chad, a country
that borders Sudan.

Millions of refugees escaping
the genocide in Sudan have ﬂed
inside the Chadian borders and
are in dire need of aid. According
to Njuguna, CARE is trying to

promote sanitation, provide food,
and aid the refugees and citizens
of Sudan in any way it can. It has
been met with resistance from the
Sudanese government.

According to Andrews, Sudan
has become the main effort of
SAIL this year.

“I think Sudan is deﬁnitely go-
ing to become the focus of this
year because of the exposure it’s
getting at the moment and the rate
at which the conﬂict is intensify-
ing,” Andrews said.

Njuguna said that Sudan is im-
portant also because of the igno-
rance that surrounds it.

“I think we decided to focus
on Sudan because we are from
Africa and we think that it’s re-
ally sad that nobody really knows
what’s going on there,” she said.

This week in the Commons,
they have set up ﬁve jars with
professors’ names on them.

Students must place money in
the jar of the professor they would
like to see perform karaoke during
halﬂime of the Parent’s Weekend
football game.

By Friday, the faculty member
with the most money will sing on
Saturday. Andrews and Njuguna
are also accepting donations at
the football game.

Saturday Nov. 11, SAIL is
hosting a talent show at 8 p.m. in
the Marketplace from which pro-
ceeds are donated to Sudan relief.
The organization will be requir-
ing a three-dollar entry fee.

The show is currently com-
prised of 16-l8 acts of dancing,
singing, and other unique talents
performed by students and faculty
members. Andrews will be comi-

cally hosting the show.

Because this is its ﬁrst year,
Njuguna said that much of it is
an experiment. The organization
hopes to raise between 1,000 and
2,500 dollars.

Andrews said that either before
or immediately following the per-
formances, she is going to give a
brief presentation and summary of
the crisis occurring in Sudan, and
more speciﬁcally, Darfur.

She and Njuguna both said that
one of the goals of SAIL is to pro-
mote campusgawareness.

“We would like to decorate the
marketplace with pictures from
the conﬂict,” Andrews said.

“As the judges are tallying the
score, I will be giving some facts
and a brief background of what’s
going on in Sudan. ,

Everyone who attends the tal-
ent show will know why we care
so much and how they’re helping.
This way, we can make a differ-
ence and have fun at the same
time.”

Both students stressed that
the goal almost as important as
fundraising is increasing aware-
ness in the W&L community and
beyond.

Njuguna said: “If nothing else,
I hope people are aware of the situ-
ation, of what is going on and real-
ize that the majority of the people
who are affected by the situation
didn’t ask for this, don’t want this
and really feel completely power-
less over the situation.

We’re in a position where even
though we can’t physically help
the situation, we are able to sup-
port those persons or organiza-
tions that are there.”

4 Sophomores Julie Peterson and Matt Amling perform at the Student Showcase on Saturday at the Keller Theater.

Actors display talent

Students illustrate stage abilities in showcase via song, dance, drama

By Queenie Wong
smrr WRITER

The lights dimmed in the
Keller Theater Saturday night,
illuminating the talent of ﬁfteen
well-rehearsed acts of singing,
dancing and acting.

A wooden bench was centered
on the stage, as Master of Cer-
emonies Mark Heavens Tshuma
emerged from the darkness, puff-
ing smoke from his cigarette.
Tshuma calmly began his mono-
logue from Death of a Salesman
and was followed by ﬂashes of
red, black and neon lights. Danc-
ers emerged act by act, as the
third annual Student Showcase
progressed.

Audience members summed
up the showcase in one word:
“amazing.”

Senior Eka Akpakip, who at-
tended the showcase last year,
said that the “diversity and over-
all quality of the acts were better
[this year].” '

The showcase, which offered
free admission, attracted an au-
dience of all different ages. Fred
Massey, a local Lexington resi-
dent, said that he was very im-

pressed with the energy and talent
of the students.

“[The community] would like
to see a little more advanced no-
tice in The News-Gazette though,”
said Massey.

The showcase may have begun
with Tshuma’s monologue, but it
certainly wasn’t the last time the
audience would see this one man
showcased. Tshuma randomly
emerged time and time again in
various dance numbers, even per-
forming to his own version of bal-
let and belting Kelly Clarkson’s
“Since You’ve Been Gone.”

Tshuma’s comedy was well re-
ceived by the audience. .

The showcase displayed ev-
erything from Broadway musi-
cals and opera, to tap dancing.
Christine Lee’s tap dancing group
mesmerized the audience by us-
ing glow sticks to enhance their
performance. All the performers
were properly dressed in attire to
match their routine as the show
alternated between dancing, act-
ing and singing.

Every audience member
seemed to have their favorite act.
Junior Theresa Dougherty praised
Lauren Kampf, the co-director

of the event, who sang “The Life
of the Party” near the end of the
show, as her “personal hero.”

“Lauren deﬁnitely has a future
career in theatre,” she said.

In addition, Dougherty en-
joyed the break dancing routine,
preformed by freshman Rasaq
Lawal.

Akpakip called freshman So-
phie Xiong’s contemporary dance
routine to Panic at the Disco‘s
“Build God Then We’ll Talk” the
most original act of the show but
couldn’t pinpoint a favorite.

According to the Chairman of
the Theater Department Joseph
Martinez, the showcase was orig-
inally started by Technical Direc-
tor Tom Anderson, who wanted
to give students, especially fresh-
men, the opportunity to show the
directors and the student body
what they could do. A

Because the Lenfest Center,
usually showcases dancing, sing-
ing and acting separately, the
event, according to Martinez, was
a good way to combine all these
acts together. In its first year, said
Kampf, the event only showcased
talent by freshmen and sopho-
mores. The event later expanded

to all classes.

Performers were asked to au-
dition, said Co-Director Jenefer
Davies.

The auditions, however, were
inclusive, meaning that most
of the acts made it into the ac-
tual showcase. She said this year
their goal was to have an even
number of dancing, singing and
acting pieces.  f"  ‘_’

The performers, who usually
have prior experience in theater
or dance, went through two
weeks of rehearsal, Kampf said.
The ﬁrst week, they met with
their directors. The second week,
the performers worked on tech-
nical aspects of their routines.

Lenfest Center Director Rob
Mish also called the showcase
a great opportunity for students,
who don’t have time to partici-
pate in an actual play or dance
performance, to demonstrate
their talent. According to Mish,
the event, which attracted ap-
proximately 350 audience mem-
bers, had a better turnout than
previous years.

“This year it was clearly stu-
dents coming to see students,”
said Mish.

Annual acoustic extravaganza
helps support service opportunities

By Joel Poelhuls
STA FF w R I TE R

usical talent was
abundant at One
Acoustic Extrava-

ganza Sunday night, though
audience members were
somewhat scarce. The empty
seats in the Lenfest Center
didn’t seem to put a damper
on the performers or the re-

_sponsiveness of the crowd,

which applauded generously
and consistently.

Proceeds from the show
went to the Catholic Campus
Ministry for sponsoring stu-
dents on spring break service
projects and building a school
in Haiti.

There was a sense of ama-
teurism pervading much of
the show, which contributed
to rather than detracted from
its enjoyment. Organizers at-
tiibuted this to an emphasis
on more artists and an attempt
to tap local talent.

“We’re trying to get back
to the roots of the event being
acoustic... not having instru-
ments that need to be plugged
in,” commented CCM Trea-
surer Matt Harrison.

Harrison also explained
that while in the past, the
program has been called One
Acoustic Evening, it was
changed to ‘Extravaganza’
this year to reﬂect the greater
number of musicians and
styles involved.

“We tried to incorporate
as many people as possible,”
he said. “With more variety,
everyone can ﬁnd at least one
act that they really enjoyed.”

Stylistically, the show was
amazingly diverse, featur-
ing traditional acoustic gui-
tar acts, pianists, A Capella
groups and bluegrass bands.

The show could be divid-
ed into roughly three parts.
First were three solo acts,
opening with Ben Goldsmith,
followed by Bill McCorkle,
and then CJ Boyd.

Next came the A Capella
groups and bands. General
Admission started off the set
with a stunning rendition of
“Africa.”

Frank Lee III thenplayed
an original piano piece en-
titled “You Make Me Smile”
before going on to conduct
Joyful Noise in three A Ca-
pella numbers.

During “He Loves Me,”
members of the crowd (in-
cluding myself) clapped
along with the singers.

Jude 24 closed out the seg-
ment with their piano-backed
Christian rock.

After this, the tone shiﬁed
radically. There was a short

break as the drums and other
equipment used by previous
bands was cleared from the
stage to make room for Poi-
son Bottom Boys and Mon-
rovia, who wrapped up the
night.

These last two groups
displayed an amazing array
of string instruments, includ-
ing a mountain dulcimer (a
four stringed instrument laid
across the lap), a mandolin
and a dobro (which looks
like a guitar with a metal
dish in it and is played hori-
zontally).

The Poison Bottom Boys
introduced to the crowd the
bluegrass style, which Mon-
rovia continued in full swing.
Monrovia provided a great
ending to the night, closing
with “Wagon Wheel,”—led by
Burr Datz.

The evening was orga-
nized by Harrison, Mad-

eleine Gent and Josh Harvey
of the CCM.
Harrison covered the ‘

 for the show, Gent .

worked on promoting it and
Harvey (who also played
piano during Joyful Noise’s
segment) was in charge of
the musical logistics.

- The CCM is a national or-
ganization, but this section’s
advisor as well as much of
its funding come from St.
Patrick’s Catholic Church.

One Acoustic Extrava-
ganza is an annual event the
ministry holds to raise mon-
ey for service programs on
spring breaks and to build a
school in Haiti.

In the past two years,
students from Washington
& Lee and VMI have volun-
teered in West Virginia and
the Gulf Coast after Humi-
cane Katrina.

“We work in tandem
with...anyone who wants to
go for a great cause and give
up their breaks,” Harrison
said.

“With hands on activities
[such as constructing hous-
ing], you can see you made
a tangible difference in peo-
ple’s lives.”

Tickets for the event were
$10. Musicians registered
with the event for free, but
had to perform at a talent

tryout to ensure a standard of
quality.
“Initially I was ap-

proached by Matt Harrison
about doing a set. When I
heard Burr Datz and Josh
Harvey were involved, I was
like ‘this is going to be wick-
ed,”’ Boyd said. “I love to
perform. It’s what I do. And
it was for good cause, which
counts for something.”

Men's Swimming

The Washington and Lee men’s
swimming team opened its
season with two big wins over
Transylvania and Centre this
past weekend. Led by senior
Mike Ginder, who was named
Division III swimmer of the
week after setting four pool re-
cords and winning four events,
the Generals won by a decisive
margin in both contests. In the
Centre match, the men set pool
records in ﬁve events. Senior
Kevin Hayes set a pool—record
in the 200 IM, and junior Tim
McGlaston took ﬁrst in both
the 50 free, which he set a pool
record in, and the 100 free.
Sophomore Chris Diebold took
ﬁrst in the 500 free, and fresh-
man Dan Austin won the 1000
free in the Centre meet. In the
Transylvania meet, the W&L
men were paced by freshmen
Jonathan Giesen and Winston
Stagg, who won two events
each. Giesen took the 1000 free
and the 100 ﬂy. Stagg ﬁnished
ﬁrst in the 200 ﬂy and the 200
IM.

Women's Swimming
The Washington and Lee wom-
en’s swimming team split deci-
sions with Centre and Transyl-
vania. The Generals opened
their weekend with a win over
Transylvania. Against Tran-
sylvania, sophomore Lindsey
Strachan won a pair of events
and swam on two winning
relay teams. She ﬁnished ﬁrst
in the 100 back and 200 back
and swam a leg on the win-
ning 200 medley and 200 free
relay teams. Freshman Sarah
Simpson also won two events
and anchored the 200 free relay
squad. Junior Amy Roberson
won the 100 ﬂy and also swam
on both winning relay squads.
In the Centre match, Strachan
won the 100 back and ﬁnished
second in the 200 free. Simpson
won the 1000 free and placed
second in the 500 free.

Field Hockey

The Washington and Lee ﬁeld
hockey team will be making
its bid for a second consecu-
tive ODAC championship this
coming weekend when they
takes to the ﬁeld on Saturday
against Eastern Mennonite in
the semifinals of the ODAC
tournament. The game will be
played on Lynchburg College’s
new turf ﬁeld. This past week-
end, the Generals were victori-
ous in their quarterﬁnal game
against Roanoke College. The
Generals were in ﬁne form,
defeating Roanoke by a score
of 6-0. The Generals were led
by junior midﬁelder Kay Dyt,
who notched a pair of goals,
and freshman forward Sallie
Armstrong, who added one goal
and two assists. Armstrong has
led the Generals in scoring with
seven goals and 11 assists for 25
points, and Christina Merchant
has been second on the team in
scoring with nine goals and six

assists for 24 points.

Soccer team drops I -0 decision to Virginia Wesleyan, ODAC bid still possible

By Mike Huntress
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee wom-
en’s soccer team had its 18-game
unbeaten streak snapped yester-
day afternoon, losing a tough 1-0
battle against Virginia Wesleyan.

Their previous

s°°"° game this season
W&L 0 on Sept. 3 was one

of the two blemish-
Va- Wes' 2 es on the General’s

otherwise ﬂawless
regular season record.

Virginia Wesleyan scored on a
goal early in the ﬁrst half, which
proved to be the difference in this
battle of strong defenses.

In goal for the Generals, Kiki
Moreo made one save in the
game. W&L was held scoreless

on 10 shots on goal.

It was only the second goal
that the Generals had surrendered
all season long.

However, with their strong
record and national ranking, the
Generals still have a great shot
at securing an NCAA tournament
bid.

They are awaiting the an-
nouncement of the at-large bids
on Sunday afternoon, when they
will ﬁnd out if their season will
continue.

In the quarterﬁnals of the
ODAC championships, W&L
won 2-0 against Emory & Hemy,
which came as no surprise to any-
one who has been tracking their
progress, as win is pretty much all
they’ve done this season.

Through 18 games this season

the Generals remain undefeated
and still have only yielded one
goal

The two goals were scored by
sophomore Anne Van Devender,
whose second goal in the 56”‘
minute (she wasted no time with
the ﬁrst, scoring only ﬁve minutes
into the game) represented a mile-
stone.

It gave her 51 points on the
season (20 goals, 11 assists),
which ties the W&L single-sea-
son record for points, formerly
held exclusively by Karin Treese,
who pulled off the feat in 1997.

Van Devender’s accomplish-
ment just adds to the long list of
gaudy stats that the Generals have
posted this season.

The second goal spelled the
end for Emory and Henry, who

was unable to mount an attack all
game, recording exactly zero shots
at’W&L keeper, Kiki Moreo.

Her seventeenth clean sheet
of the season extended her own
W&L single-season record. The
stats jump out at any sports fan,
but watching the Generals play
on Saturday, it was obvious they
were in a different class than their
opponents.

There was visible frustration
on the face of E&H’s second half
keeper, Megan Smith, as the ball
was constantly on the E&H side
of the ﬁeld.

W&L’s formidable defense re-
peatedly beat back any offensive
attempts by the Wasp’s strikers.
W&L’s goalie, Moreo, seemed
almost bored at times.

This was one of the most re-

vealing examples of W&L’s pure
domination: the clear contrast be-
tween the cool and calm nature
of Moreo and the frazzled look
that characterized E&H’s goalies
(they pulled the starter after the
ﬁrst half), the second of which
seemed like she spent half her
time on the ground, diving after
W&L’s many shot attempts.

What was really remarkable
was that the score was as close as
it was.

The only previous meeting be-
tween the two teams resulted in a
7-0 win for W&L. The game on
Saturday could easily have had a
similar result.

All the Generals can do now
is wait until Sunday to ﬁnd out if
their season will continue on to
the NCAA tournament.

Six game Win streak snapped

Generals suffer tough lose to Bridgewater amid poor conditions and injuries

By Brian Devine
STAFF WRITER

Before Saturday’s game
against Bridgewater College,
the Washington and Lee football
team knew that a victory was not
essential to their goal of winning
the 2006 Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championship.

That fact did not lessen the
blow when the Generals fell 27-8
in Bridgewater, Virginia.

Handicapped by injuries and
weather, the Blue and White faced
an uphill battle against the ﬁve-
time reigning ODAC champions.

Jopson Field on the Bridgewa-
ter campus was muddy enough to
turn the Generals’ white road uni-
forms brown, and winds over the
stadium reached forty m.p.h.

The Generals’ running game
never materialized, as tailback
Jordan Campbell (10 net yards)
and wingback Colton Ward (20

yards rushing) struggled to gain
solid footing and ﬁnd open run-
ning lanes against a swarming
Eagles defense.

Already missing usual starter
Stuart Sitterson, the Generals
suffered another backﬁeld blow
when Ward left the game in the
third quarter due to a mild’concus-
sion. Both Sitterson and Ward are
questionable for next Saturday’s
game against Emory and Henry.

The Eagles, however, had no
such problems on the ground.
The hosts split rushing duties be-
tween 210-pound tailback Win-
ston Young (26 carries, 94 yards,
one touchdown) and his team-
mate Philip Carter (14 carries, 79
yards, one touchdown).

Coming into the game, Young
and Carter were ranked ﬁrst and
second in the conference in rush-
ing yards.

The Generals’ usually stingy
defense allowed 367 total yards

and were led by safety Kyle Luby,
credited with 16 total tackles,
though only seven of those were
solo.

It was an oft-repeated event on
Saturday to see Young or Carter
drive into a pile of linemen from
both teams, break several tackles
and rumble forward until three
or four W&L players could bring
him down.

While Carter and Young made
primarily downhill runs, running
parallel to the sideline, Ward and
Campbell’s runs were often de-
pendent on cutting from one side-
line to the other, a game plan that
was particularly ineffective under
such miserable conditions.

Freshman quarterback R.J.
Vamer emphasized the Eagles’
ﬁeld position when describing the
disparity in offensive statistics
between W&L (11 total rushing
yards) and Bridgewater (266).

“In the ﬁrst quarter,” said Var-

ner, “we had a couple of three-
and-outs, then we had the wind in
our faces when we punted away.”

Bridgewater’s average start in
the ﬁrst quarter was at the W&L
47-yard line. All three of the Ea-
gles’ offensive touchdowns came
before halﬂime, and all three
scoring drives came oﬁ” of W&L
punts into the strong gusts from
the west.

The Generals’ passing attack
fared only slightly better than
their ground game, achieving 137
yards. W&L’s usual game plan is
to run the ball in order to set up
the passing game.

Missing Sitterson and later
Ward, the visitors were unable
to do so, enabling the Eagles to
keep two defenders on wideout
Jack Martin nearly all game. De-
spite that, Martin excelled when
he was thrown to, catching three
passes for 85 yards and the Gen-
erals’ lone touchdown.

Martin’s 63-yard reception to
set up the touchdown electriﬁed
the dozens of brave souls who
traveled to Bridgewater to see the
game.

The W&L contingent, al-
though smaller than the home
crowd, was consistently more
vocal. W&L students are rarely
dedicated enough to attend road
games, and several players com-
mented on the loud support from
the visiting stands.

Though disappointed with
the loss, the traveling supporters
were able to walk away knowing

I that the W&L cross-country team

had won both men’s and women’s
ODAC titles- results that were an-
nounced over the Public Address
system at halftime.

The Generals need only beat
Emory and Henry at home on
Parents’ Weekend to win their
ﬁrst outright conference title
since 1981.

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 11

Breaking down
‘ the AP rankings

Lewis launches “Adam is Poll ” for college football

ByAdam Lewls
COLUMNIST

I hate to break it to all you Big
East fans, but the Big East sucks.
Well, to put it less bluntly, it is
overrated.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad
news, but your undefeated teams
of West Vir-
ginia, Louis-
ville, and Rut-
gers have been

playing high
school teams
that disguise

themselves as
Syracuse, Con-
necticut, Pitts-
burgh, and so on, and it would
simply be unfair to compare them
to schools in the SEC or Big Ten.
Again, I am so sorry.

Following the loss of South-
ern California to Oregon State,
West Virginia moved up to the #3
ranked team, Louisville to #5, and
Rutgers to #12.

With this said, there is a chance
that the winner of this week’s
West Virginia v. Louisville game
could potentially go on to the
National Championship (pend-
ing the ﬁnishes of Michigan and
Ohio State). Yes, it iss true. The
national championship!

Is thatiiilotiitypically reserved
for the two best teams in the
country? I thought so too.

I mean, just looking at sched-
ules, one can see that neither of
these possible national champi-
onship contenders (WVU or UL)
has played a ranked team yet, save
for Louisville’s match-up against
Miami.

Now don’t get me wrong, they
are still great teams, and there’s
no reason why they shouldn’t be
in the top ten, but when you com-
pare their competition with that of
every single SEC team, it almost
seems like a crime.

Let’s take LSU for example,

I would however; like to propose ‘Adam is Poll ’of

thetop 15 teams (the new AP), which barring any
diﬁiculties should be in effect nationally by 2007.

which is ranked #17, ﬁve behind
Rutgers.

Sure they may have two loss-
es, but at the time of each of these
losses, they played the #2 team in
the country, Auburn and Florida
respectively.

And while they were holding
Auburn to a single touchdown for
a hard-fought loss on the road,
Rutgers was allowing the same
amount to Ohio for an easy vic-
tory at home, (and just to clear
up any confusion, Ohio does not
have the word “State” following
it).

Furthermore, LSU still must
ﬁnish out its season with teams
like #8 Tennessee, #12 Arkan-
sas, and Alabama. Two of those
games take place on the road in
some of the toughest places to
play in the country. Rutgers, on
the other hand, does face West
Virginia and Louisville, but fortu-
nately enough, gets bye weeks in
between when they play Cincin-
nati and Syracuse. 2 

Now when I mention ‘LSU,
I’m not using them because they
are the only example of a team in
the SEC with a tough schedule.

In fact, if you look every other
team in that conference, you will
see that week in and week out,
they must go up against defenses
known for being extremely tough
and relentless. ‘

And in most cases, these
games occur within a week or two
of each other, leaving every team
worn out.

In addition, the Big Ten boasts
some of the country’s best offens-
es, including the #l and #2 teams,
Ohio State and Michigan. Teams

in the Big Ten can never afford to
take a week off, knowing that at
any given time, their conference
opponents, which include teams‘
like Penn State, Wisconsin, and
Iowa, can put up huge numbers.

I could go on forever, taking
every team in the SEC and Big
Ten and comparing their sched-
ules with those of the Big East.

And maybe it would be best
for the BCS if I did, because I
don’t know if they get it just yet.
But, seeing that I have probably
already angered more than a few
fans, I’ll save myself future as-
saults.

I would however, like to pro-
pose “Adam’s Poll” of the top 15
teams (the new AP), which, bar-
ring any diﬁiculties, should be in
effect nationally by 2007:

1. Ohio State

2. Michigan

3. Texas

4. Florida

5. Auburn

6. West Virginia
 Tennessee

8_. Southern California

9. Louisville

10. Notre Dame

1 l . Arkansas

12. California

13. Louisiana State

14. Oklahoma

15. Clemson

If you notice, Rutgers is no-
where to be found on this list, and
a lot more would have to happen
for West Virginia or Louisville
to reach the National Champion-
ship. But hey, I guess that’s never
out of the question when you play
teams who Washington and Lee
would beat!

Volleyball wins
63rd straight.
ODAC contest

By Lara Jordan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and
Lee volleyball team won
their ﬁrst round match of
the ODAC championship
in convincing fashion over
8"‘-seeded Randolph-Macon
Women’s College 30-25, 30-
17, 30-15.

The team improved their
overall record to 25-7. The
win was the Generals’ 63“
consecutive conference vic-
tory, and as the toumament’s
number one seed, W&L is
in the driver’s seat as they
move into the conference
semiﬁnals.

The team has differ-
ent motives for the wanting
to win the championship.
Freshman Jess Bunnell sees
the win as a gift to the gradu-
ating seniors.

“Volleyball has been such
a strong program here for the
last few years, and I want to
keep that winning tradition
alive,” said Bunnell. “A team
should always been improv-
ing, and for the senior’s sake,
I would love to make it far-
ther I would love for us to
make it farther into NCAAS
than last year’s team.”

In the R-MWC game, the
Generals were led by sopho-
more outside hitter Laura
Maurer, who recorded 10
kills, 10 digs and three ser-
vice aces.

Freshman setter Kristi
Stevens racked up a team-
high 28 assists, while senior
libero Lauren Edmonson
added 20 digs.

Sophomore right side
Jessica Ulrich added an ad-

Utter domination

ditional nine kills, nine digs, four
service aces and two blocks.

Part of the reason for the girl’s
success is the uniﬁcation of the
team.

“We set a lot of goals at the be-
ginning of the season and keeping
our focus on the same goals uni-
ﬁes us,” said Megan Steinhardt.
“We know we can always count
on one another to help each other
out.”

With the win, the Generals are
in position for another ODAC
championship and bid to the
NCAA tournament.

Senior captain Ashley Hurt
added, “The win for the Gener-

Randolph Macon Women’s

Hockey blanks Roanoke

Field hockey team advances to ODAC semiﬁnals with 6-0 win

By Mlke Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee ﬁeld
hockey team cruised to a 6-0 vic-
tory over Roanoke in their quar-
terﬁnal ODAC game.

The Generals were led by
junior midﬁelder Kay Dyt who
notched a pair of goals, and fresh-
man forward Sallie Armstrong,
who added one goal and two as-
sists.

The Generals opened strong
when Armstrong scored the ﬁrst
goal of the game two minutes into
the ﬁrst half, off an assist from
junior midﬁelder Kendall Korte.
Dyt then scored her ﬁrst goal less

than four minutes later.

Sophomore forward Melissa
Dolan added the Generals third
goal of the game in the 28th min-
ute off of a pass from sophomore
forward Christina Merchant, to
take a dominating 3-0 lead into
the half.

Dyt added some insurance
shortly into the second half, when
she scored her second goal of the
game off of an assist from Ann-
strong. The Generals continued
their domination as freshman
midﬁelder Alex Caritis and senior
defender Kim Babbitt added goals
later in the second half.

Junior Tara Rubenstein and
freshman Caroline Habliston

shared the goal keeping duties for
W&L, combining to make four
saves.

Following the victory, Dolan
said, “Our victory against Roa-
noke was great since during the
regular season they took us to
overtime at their home ﬁeld. I
think we have come together as a
team since that game, and we are
deﬁnitely on right now.”

The Generals will face Eastern
Mennonite in the semiﬁnals of
the ODAC Tournament on Friday

in Lynchburg, Va. The Lynch- 1

burg home ﬁeld is new grass tuft,
which could pose a test to the
Generals.

Merchant added, “We will be

playing on Lynchburg’s new
grass turf, which could be a
challenge, since we have yet to
play on grass turf this season.”

However, as the Generals
ﬁnish out to ODAC champi-
onship they are posed to chal-
lenge any team that stands up
to them.

Dolan added, “The game
against EMU on Friday will be
tough; the last time we played
them we won because we were
so focused and psyched up. If
we win the ODAC, we have
a good chance of hosting the
ﬁrst round of NCAA’s, which
would give our seniors one last
game on our home turf.”

are crucial to race planning
and execution.“

Friski added, “We log hun-
dreds of miles to achieve the nec-
essary ﬁtness to bring back the
ODAC title to Washington and
Lee. Pure and simple, we run to
get fast. After the gun goes off, it
is you against every other runner.
The fastest person wins and the
best team of the day walks home
with the hardware.”

One of the keys to the Gener-
als success can be seen in their
coach, John Tucker. Tucker, a
W&L alum in his 18th year as
head coach, captured his sixth
career ODAC championshﬁp with
the Generals’ victory in Harrison-
burg.

“Coach Tucker is a remarkable
coach. He takes what we give him
in the form of summer training
and gets us to the place we need
to be at the end of the season. His
coaching is easily the key ingredi-

ent to our success,” Friski said.

Berry explained, “At the be-
ginning of the season, our head
coach, John Tucker, gave us some
very simple goals. As he put it,
‘Get in the best shape you can,
stay healthy, and run up to your
potential.’ Looking back on what
has been and continues to be a
very successful season, we have
accomplished each one of the
three goals coach set out for us
months ago.”

The Generals next return to

action on November 11, when
they travel to Atlanta, Ga., to
participate in the NCAA South/
Southeast Regional at Emory
University.

Brower concluded, “The sea-
son isn’t over yet. Our top 7 will
be racing at the NCAA South/
Southeast Regional Champion-
ship. We won’t be contending
for a team berth at Nationals this
year, but placing in the top 4 or
top 5 would be a great note on
which to end the season.”

time of 26:05.12 for the race,
the Generals’ average time was
better than any other team’s by
almost a minute. _

Sophomore Jackie Burns led
the way for the Generals, winning
the race in a time of 24:36.60.
Burns was named ODAC Runner
of the Year for the second straight
season. Freshman Kat Telfeyan
ﬁnished second overall with a
time of 25:17.20. Telfeyan was
awarded First Team All-ODAC
honors and was named the ODAC
Rookie of the Year.

Sophomore Becca Taylor
placed eighth overall with a time
of 26:38.70. Freshman Dorothy
Todd ﬁnished 10th other in a time
of 26:55.20, while senior captain
Jenny Ratzel crossed the ﬁnish
line in llth place with a time
of 26:57.90. The Generals also
had a strong showing from their
freshmen as Mary France Weath-
erly placed 13th in 27:07.10 and
Elizabeth Krausnick placed 14th
recording a time of 27:17.80.

When asked about the team’s
success throughout the course of
the season, captain Ratzel said,
“It was important that we re-
mained focused on our goal and
that we didn’t take for granted the
fact that we’d won the past two
years. The team has been really
disciplined this year.”

Taylor, Todd, Ratzel, Weath-

erly, and Krausnick all received
Second Team All-ODAC honors
following their ﬁnishes. Taylor
was also named as the ODAC
Women’s Cross Country Scholar-
Athlete of the Year.

With another excellent show-
ing at the ODAC championships,
the team showed their utter domi-
nation of the conference. How-
ever, it’s important to note that
while the Generals did have the
fastest runner to cross the ﬁn-
ish line, their championship was
team wide. They relied on a great
deal of depth and strength from
all of their runners in order to win
the championship.

Ratzel added, “I’m really
proud of the girls, everyone ran
really well. And it doesn’t matter
whether they were number one
or number 16, everyone has been
working since June to earn this.”

Fourth-year Head Coach Kris
Hoey was named the ODAC
Women’s Cross Country Coach
of the Year.

Ratzel points to the leadership
of Hoey as a key to the Generals’
success, adding, “She’s deﬁnitely
our number one fan and and a
great friend.”

The Generals next return to
action on November 11, when
they travel to Atlanta, Ga., to
participate in the NCAA South/
Southeast Regional at Emory
University.

Coach Rolf Piranian gets 25 0th victory as team captures 2-Oﬁrst round win

By Brian Devlne
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team moved into
the second round of the Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference tour-
nament Saturday, notching a 2-0
win against Eastern Mennonite
University and picking up the

250‘*‘ career win for

of a disappoint-
ing home loss against Lynchburg
earlier in the week. The Gener-
als came into the game ranked
22”“ in the nation, and the 2-0 loss
dropped theminto the third seed
for the ODAC tournament, behind
Lynchburg and Roanoke College.
W&L ﬁnished the regular season

with a record of 11-2-2, going 6-
2-1 in conference play.

Against the sixth-seeded Roy-
als of Eastern Mennonite, W&L
came out ﬁring early, picking
up both of their goals in the ﬁrst
half.

In the 21“ minute of regula-
tion, junior midﬁelder Josh Dodds
scored the opening goal of of a
rebound, and just 16 minutes later,

Drew Crowley was credited with
the assist on the second goal.

Credit for the victory must
also be given to the Generals’
defense, who allowed eight shots
and only one shot on goal, which
was easily turned away by junior
goalkeeper Ted Sheedy.

W&L had a total of 36 shots

and 13 shots on goal.

The shutout was Sheedy’s
eighth of the season, and low-
ered his goals against average to
0.45 on the year. W&L has only
allowed eight goals this season,
while scoring a total of 42.

Coming into the game, the
Generals were set on avenging
their loss earlier in the week,
looking toward the playoffs as a

as a ‘second season,”’ said fresh-
man midﬁelder Strock Moore.

“We believe that we’re a good
team that has the potential to do
well in the postseason.”

Besides providing a chance to
bounce back from a difﬁcult loss,
the win also marked a personal
milestone for head coach Rolf Pi-

ranian. The veteran coach gained
his 250“‘ career win on Saturday,
bringing his overall record with
W&L to 250-206-33 over a span
of 31 years.
