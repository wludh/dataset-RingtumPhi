   Computing Search under dispute 

 

Search begins without faculty from computer science department

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS EDITOR

As Provost Tom Williams

‘ ~ leads the search for a new direc-

tor of University Computing, the
Department of Computer Science

, wants to have its say.

The nine person search com-
mittee, chaired by Williams, does
not include any faculty from the
computer science department.
The only undergraduate faculty
member on the committee is Bob
Ballenger, Associate Professor
for Information Systems in the
Williams School.

Ballenger’s background and
published works make him quali-
ﬁed to serve on the committee,
but Ken Lambert, head of the
computer science department,
noted the lack of faculty from the

college.

When asked if his department
was involved in the search, Lam-
bert said, “No, we’re not.  Not
only are they no computer science
faculty, but there are no faculty
from the College at all.”

Aside from Williams and Bal-
lenger, the following people are
on the search committee: John
Watkins and Dean Tallman from
University Computing, Associ-
ate Dean of the College Elizabeth
Knapp, Associate Registrar Bar-
bara Rowe, Associate Law Dean
John Keyser and University Li-
brarian Merrily Taylor.

Williams said he had consid-
ered adding a member of the com-
puter science department.

“A fully representative c_om—
mittee would be of a size that
would make it difﬁcult to func-

tion,” he said. “When we get a
short list of . candidates ﬁnalized
they will meet with a bigger
group on campus, including stu-
dents and faculty.”

Lambert’s department has four
full-time faculty members and av-
erages between ﬁve and 20 senior
major candidates each year. He
said the department has a national
reputation.

“Our curriculum is second to
none. In the past we’ve been a
member of the Liberal Arts Com-
puting Consortium along with
schools like William and Mary,
Grinnell, Swarthmore, Williams,
and Dartmouth. We have a staff
that publishes in major journals
and we have a National Science
Foundation grant that’s given us a
million dollars in funding.”

Lambert also has published

18 textbooks on introductory
programming for the college and
high school levels.

Though his department is not
represented on the search com-
mittee, Lambert says they have a
strong relationship with Univer-
sity Computing.

“We have a half-time tech sup-
port person that we share with
University Computing’s Instruc-
tional Technology Group. He’s
our liaison to University Comput-
ing, so if we need any further sup-
port he works to obtain that.”

Lambert said University Com-
puting has several outstanding
staff members who have worked
well his department over the
years, but he said his department
“has seen the need to have [their]
own tech support.”

Williams echoed Lambert’s

comments and said he is currently
working on solutions.

“Computer Science needs
dedicated support like Chemistry,
Biology, Geology and Engineer-
ing have.

“Right now they have half-
time so it’s not really Univer-
sity Computing supporting them.
Dean Dobin, Ken Lambert and
I are working to ﬁnd a solution
that’ll support their unique needs
— they’re not dependant on Uni-
versity Computing.

“They have a sub-network
needs dedicated support to serve
their needs.”

Williams said the new direc-
tor will need to understand the
unique perspectives of the law
school, library, Williams School
and computer science department.
The new director will lead a staff
of 31 full-time and four part-time
employees.

“In the last decade the Williams

School has grown in its need for
tech support,” Williams said.

Ruth Floyd, the Acting Direc-
tor of University Computing, said
her department works to keep up
with changes in the industry.

“We look at what’s in use na-
tionwide in higher education and
business — the Williams School
especially is interested in that.”

When Floyd joined the staff
in 1981, the department had four
employees. She now supervises
31 full-time and 4 part-time staff.

Lambert and the computer sci-
ence department will wait to who
the search committee selects.

Though he says the department
has knowledge to contribute for
improvements on the academic
side, the professors have not been
consulted.

“We just feel we’ve got some
expertise that we can contribute
to a search for a new director,”
Lambert said.

The Pope needs
  to try some tact

As others talk, 

Why Benedict XVI and his critics should calm down

By Craig Malkmes
C0 LU M NIST

In light of the worldwide reli-
gious tension of not only the past
several years but indeed the past
millennium, the comments issued
by the Pope in his recent speech
at the University of Regensburg
in Germany encompass a mistake
that is wholly inexcusable and, as
many Muslims would agree, ex-
tremely difﬁcult to forgive.

The Pope quoted a 14th-cen-
tury Byzantine emperor who de-
nounced Mohammad’s teachings
and ultimately the teachings of
the Islamic faith. The emperor ac-
cused Mohammed of maintaining
“evil" and “inhumane” principles
and that he commanded followers
of Islam to “spread by the sword
the faith he preached.”

I’ll say up front that I in no
way associate myself with the Is-
lamic faith, and that I am a Chris-
tian. However, studying religions
during college has given me a
certain respect for other faiths
throughout the world, whether
still widely practiced or not. Un-
fortunately, it remains a certain
respect that is, for the most part,
unaccepted by a large majority of
various cultures.

Indeed, it is never acceptable
for one to disrespect a certain re-
ligion and essentially attack its
followers, whether with verbal
deﬁlement or physical violence.

The Pope has since issued a
statement in which he claims that
the words of this Byzantine em-
peror do not reﬂect the actual sen-
timents of the Papacy.

Indeed, it is never acceptable for one to disre-

spect a certain religion and essentially attack

its followers, whether with verbal deﬁlement or

physical violence.

However, the fact remains that
the Pope chose not only to include
the brief quotation in his speech,
but also neglected to question and
ultimately disprove it. To quote
one of my pledge brothers, “. . .
dude, that’s just something you
don’t do.” It is completely inex-
cusable to make such a public
comment as that, whether he em-
braces it or denounces it.

The Pope is certainly not the
only one at fault in this situation;
the reactions of some Muslims
to Benedict’s words are equally
disrespectful and audacious. The
supreme leader of Iran issued a
response to the Pope’s speech in
Germany in which he accuses
the pontiff of planning to launch
a new crusade against Islam, and
says the Pope has been attempting
to incite intense religious fervor.
Many Muslims in Turkey main-
tain that he essentially aims to
revive the crusader spirit within
Christians that was so prevalent
during the medieval ages. Some
Muslims have even attacked sev-
eral churches in retaliation.

Don’t be ridiculous. The Pope
is scheduled to visit Turkey soon,
where he will be surrounded by

Muslims. Surely it was planned
as an extension of peaceful sen-
timent, as the Pope would not be
visiting if he was unwilling to
understand the differing beliefs
as well as the unfamiliar culture
around him.

It is incredibly ignorant for
Americans to hold a feeling of
hatred toward all Muslims as a
result of the heinous acts that
only a miniscule percent of the
Islamic faith commit. It is equally
as ignorant for Muslims to com-
mit these atrocities in the name
of a God who would not condone
them, against people who have
not wronged them.

Remarks that have such po-
tential to incite more religious
tension should remain unvoiced.
Instead, one should respect the
faiths of others, for it is nobody’s
place to comment on what they
misconstrue as ﬂaws in some-
thing they don’t believe in or even
wholly understand. The Native
Americans accepted the fact that
other cultures will have different
religions, and they expected it. I
ﬁnd nothing wrong with this men-
tality.

Where is the respect? 

At a school where admin-
istrators love giving lofty
speeches about student re-
sponsibility, Jason Rodocker
quietly takes action.

After years of confusing
rules and uneven enforce-
ment from the Inter-frater-
nity Council, Rodocker is
working with the IFC to
make sure Greek men across
campus know what is ex-
pected of them.

“I didn’t know the rules”
will not longer be an accept-
able excuse when fraternities
or individuals get themselves
into trouble, and that’s a
change for the better.

In past years, only a hand-
ful of chapter ofﬁcers knew
the rules and expectations of
the IFC, and even those se-
lect few seemed a bit shaky
on the details.

Oﬁicers would some-
times have to check the IFC
Constitution, housing cor-
poration guidelines, lease
agreements, and university
policies to decide how a giv-
en rule worked.

Now everything is being
consolidated into compre-
hensive yet concise guide-

lines.

Rodocker and the IFC
want everyone to be account-
able for the actions of their
houses.

Chapter presidents and
IF C members will no longer
be the only people who un-
derstand the rules.

Instead of simply let-
ting chapter presidents de-
liver messages, Rodocker
has started visiting different
fraternities to explain the
changes.

The IFC wisely met with
sophomore men who are liv-
ing in Greek housing this
year.

At the meeting Rodocker,
IFC President Drew Fla-
nigan and Senior Justice
David Mitchell explained
the expectations and require-
ments of living in fraternity
houses.

Rodocker shiﬁed the bur-
den of responsibility onto all
Greek men, not just a select
few.

These actions don’t mean
everything in the Greek sys-
tem is perfect .

Far from it.

Fraternities

are strug-

Rodocker acts

Staﬂer pours time, energy into thankless job

gling to adjust to Virginia’s
harsh new minor-in-posses-
sion laws and the suddenly
aggressive actions of the
Lexington Police and the
Rockbridge County Sheriff
Departments.

Still, Rodocker, who ar-
rived on campus a year ago,
has wasted little time trying
to improve the W&L frater-
nity system.

The IFC will need to
help fraternities protect their
members as well as freshmen
from arrest.

The new get-tough atti-
tude won’t stop parties, but it
may change how they work.

Each year will bring new
challenges to W&L’s unique
fraternity system, and each
challenge will require cre-
ative solutions.

We can’t vouch for
Rodocker’s creativity, but
we can speak to his commit-
ment.

The lights in his office go
dark at eight p.m. far more
often than they do at ﬁve.

Rodocker is straightening
things out. We like that.

Frankly, we’ll skip the
speeches and take action.

Beer Spillers and Toe Killers need to shape up and watch their step

By Grace Andrews
00 LU M NIST

Today’s topic is respect, or the
lack of it here at Washington and
Lee. Let ’s start with some person-
al stories. Just the other day my
suitemate and I were waiting in
line at the Co-Op when suddenly
a stampede of people came in.
They all somehow didn’t see us
and broke in line. Now, I do know
that I am only 5’3 and a l—lbs.
(my weight is only for God, my
doctor, and myself to know), but
how did they miss me? Last time
I checked, a line usually goes in
one direction and the end is be-
hind the person who was standing
there when you walked in.

Granted, these people could
have been suffering from tempo-
rary blindness, but what are the
chances of all of them going blind
in the same moment and miss-
ing me in my bright Skittle Blue
shirt? That’s right--slim to none!

But my_ problem with the ob-
vious breaking in line was that
none of them apologized or even
looked back to see the angry little
person (me) giving them dirty
glances. They didn’t even care.

It may sound very third-grad-
ish, but I think that breaking in
line is wrong. I try my hardest not
to participate in this sort of devi-
ant behavior. I respect lines and I
know that if someone has had to
wait they deserve to be ahead of
me.

My next complaint is how
some people treat the D-Hall and
Co-Op workers. I can’t even re-
member the number of times that
people have asked a worker in the
D-hall where something was and
used what I call an unacceptable
tone. An unacceptable tone would
sound like the same tone you

would use to talk to a younger
sibling who was caught snooping
in your room. The workers here
are not your personal servants,
and treating them so is wrong.

The most common form of
disrespect I see in these areas are
when people leave trays, cups,
silverware, and even food on the
tables. Now, why in the world
would someone just leave a tray
on the table, or better yet leave so
much trash on the table it looks
like maybe the table was their
tray?

Last year, when I ate in D-
Hall, I would always ﬁnd myself
picking up dirty cups and silver-
ware for other people. The prob-
lem with this is that my name is
not Alfred, and it’s not my job
to clean up for them. If you are
old enough to walk and talk, you
are old enough to clean your own
mess. Last time I checked, no one
here was wearing Pampers or in
need of a bottle.

The other place , that people
leave these sort of messes are in
the dorms. Just the other day my
friends and I saw orange rinds on
the top of the steps right outside of
Gaines. Now, I may be mistaken,
but I don’t think a staircase can be
considered a trash can. Oh yeah,
and that goes for hallways too.

Now, another place that I see
disrespect is on Traveller and at
parties. One of my Taveller mem-
ories involves me at a party being
pushed out of the way by a Small
Person Pusher who was clearly
about 62 or taller. This Pusher
was so eager to get on Traveller
that he had no problem pushing
little 01’ me out of the way to se-
cure his own seat.

Honestly, it was like a scene
from “Godzilla.” Here’s this big
creature picking up something a

million times smaller than him,:
me. The only difference is he
wasn’t that big and I didn’t see
him tossing any cars, picking up
people, or climbing any buildings;
apart from these small differ-
ences, it was just like the movie.
The Pusher can also be seen push-
ing people out of the way at par-
ties. Their ability to walk through
crowds is like Moses’ ability to
part water.

Also at these parties, I have
been attacked by the Beer Spiller
and Toe Killer. The Beer Spiller
is usually a little tipsy and wob-
bles around at parties accidentally
spilling alcohol on the ﬂoor and
whomever is out of their blurred
line of vision. This is usually
me since everyone at this school
seems to be part human, part Jolly
Green Giant.

Next is the Toe Killer. This
is usually the young lady in too-
expensive stilettos who steps
on anything and everything that
moves and almost always seems
to step on your big toe, usually
four or ﬁve times. Sometimes, the
Beer Spiller and Toe Killer are
one and the same. V

The Beer Spiller is a bit like
the Small Person Pusher and Toe
Killer since apologizing isn’t in
their nature. Who cares if you are
tipsy. You should still have the
decency to say “sorry,” or “ex-
cuse me.”

Once again, I must place a dis-
claimer here: If any of what I said
describes and/or offends you, that
is not my goal. BUT if you are of-
fended, I suggest you think about
why.

THE RING-TUM PHI ° 3

. arts&Iile

 

By Julie von Sternberg
STAFF WRITER

If you are looking for inspira-
tion, be at Lee Chapel on Tuesday
to hear U.S. Gymnastic Hall of
F amer Dominique Dawes.

If it’s entertainment you seek,
a stand-up comedy performance
by comedian Tim Young is only a
few days away.

Dawes was invited by the Con-
tact Committee to give a speech
entitled “Success is a Journey,
Not a Description.” The com-
mittee said that Dawes’ words of
wisdom will leave students both
uplifted and motivated.

Young was chosen by the
General Activities Board solely to
bring laughter and entertainment
to Washington and Lee.

Dawes, called “Awesome
Dawesome” by fans, was a mem-
ber Of the U.S. Olympic Gym-
nastics team known as the “Mag-
niﬁcent Seven,” which won Team
Gold in Atlanta in 1996. She also
became the first African American
to win an individual event medal
with her bronze on the ﬂoor ex-
ercise.

This is the first time that Con-
tact has brought an athlete to
speak about his or her career.

In the past, the Committee
has invited political activists like
Ralph Nader, whose discussion
of debatable topics was both ridi-
culed and praised.

“That’s all part of providing
the campus with entertaining, en-
gaging, and relevant speakers,”
said Contact Committee Member
David Kronenfeld.

However, to start the year off
right, the Committee opted for a
speaker that is less controversial.

“We wanted someone who
people from both sides of the
aisle and across a spectrum of ide-
ologies could come together and
enjoy,” said Kronenfeld.

As the current President of the
Women’s Sports Foundation and a
retired Broadway actress, Dawes
is a role model for all young
women. Because of high name
recognition, members of Contact
are expecting a larger than normal
crowd than previous years.

Junior Jenny Sproul teaches
gymnastics in downtown Lexing-
ton and is one of many students
excited about Dawes’ visit.

“I deﬁnitely followed The
Magniﬁcent Seven,” said Sproul.
“I read books about them after the
fact because I was so excited
they’d won the Olympics. I deﬁ-
nitely wanted to be one of them!”

The GAB has the same high
expectations for comedian Tim

Young.

111 the past the GAB has pre-
sented comedy shows such as
“Second City,” which consists of
short “Saturday Night Live” type
skits. This year, the committee
wanted to ﬁnd a fresh and unique
perfonner who would attract a
larger audience.

Young was ﬁrst seen by stu-
dents Katie Cannody, Morgan
Harris, Dominique Lamb, and
Rohan Poojara at the National
Association of Campus Activities
national conference in Boston last
February.

At the NACA conference,
students enjoyed performances
by dozens of musicians, speak-
ers, and comedians including
Josh Blue, the winner, and Ty
Barnett, the 2nd place winner of
“Last Comic Standing.”

After all the performances,
the students unanimously chose
Young.

“He was chosen because he
seemed to have intellectual humor
that the W&L students that saw
him believed would be appreciat-
ed and enjoyed on campus,” said
Jason Rodocker, Director of Stu-
dent Activities & Greek Life.

This week's events:

- Domlnlque Dawes, Sept. 26 at 7:30 p.m. in Lee Chapel (by

Contact)

- Tlm Young, Sept. 28 at 8 p.m. in Keller Theater (by GAB)

 Golden opportunity

Gymnast Dominique Dawes, comedian Tim Young to entertain W&L

In addition, Young charges
a third of the price for a normal
performer, which enables the
GAB to bring two more come-
dians to W&L before the end of
the year.

It is unknown what type of
material Young will present but
the committe is not worried.

“He has a style that could be
enjoyed by anybody - not of-
fensive or obnoxious, just solid
humor,” said Rodocker

Young has gained experience
performing in front of a variety
of audiences, colleges and clubs
all over the United States. He
has even appeared on television
as a performer on Comedy Cen-
tral’s “Premium Blend,” a com-
mentator on El television’s “50
Most Outrageous Moments,”
and a guest star on the cartoon
show “Daria”.

Sophomore. Morgan Harris,
also a stand-up comedian, looks
forward to seeing Young per-
form again. He describes Young
as “an observational comedian
like Jerry Seinfeld, but with a
faster and more crowd-interac-
tive delivery.”

As part of the comedy club,
Harris has performed at two
W&L comedy shows in the
Commons. At this year’s stu-
dent’s activity fair, Harris hap-
pily watched as 100 students
who share his interest for com-
edy signed up for the club.

Frats struggle to
obey IFC orders

and sorority standards, we
will look to ﬁnd ways to make
the system more effective and
more consistent. The system is
good at face value, but we can-
not begin nor do we want to cod-
ify expectations and guidelines
for all situations.”

Rodocker says the strike
system has led to “tangible, no-
ticeable improvements” but cau-
tions against being “complacent
because we’re better.”

He echoes Flanigan’s com-
mitment to consistency by mak-
ing it a goal this year for the IFC
to “get better at explaining the
logic” behind its actions.

For all parties involved, edu-
cation is paramount. Rodocker
said “educating the chapter
members about policy” is the
most important pillar of the
IFC.

Flanigan’s hope for this year
is “to continually facilitate a bet-
ter understanding of University
policies with a hope that we can
make Greek events safer.”

situation and social probation,”
Rothey said.

He points to years of unwrit-
ten and often unenforced rules as
a major stumbling block to educa-

IFC for having taken “large steps
to clear up misunderstandings,
such as clarifying the IFC Consti-
tution and Grand Chapter Meet-
ings to start every semester.”

For Rodocker, it’s all part of
the job. Education is important,
he maintains, because the Greek
system is important.

“The University has student
issues with potential Greek solu-
tions,” he says. “Greek organiza-
tions are based on good values
and concepts and if members un-
derstand those values, it will help
lessen student issues.”

THE RING-TUM PHI - 5

By Joel Poelhuls
su r r w RITE R

If football were a business, the
lineman would be the blue collar
workers. Though they do the dirty
jobs, heavy lifting and form the
core of any team, you are unlikely
to hear their names called in the
stadium nor mentioned in the
Monday paper. Of course, any-

one associated with

9°°|'° the game knows the
W&L 21 importance of this
Sewanee 7 group-

Thus, a season
as successful as the
Generals’ last (the winningest in
20 years) is largely attributable
to the strength of their line. This
year’s team returns ﬁve play-
ers with signiﬁcant experience
from last year: Left tackle Bob
Hetherington (Jr.), left guard Dan
Felezzola (Jr.), right tackle Alex
Skotnicki (Jr.), center Chas Col-
lins (Sr.), and right guard Hunter
Whitﬁeld (Sr.), a team captain
who earned ﬁrst team all-confer-
ence honors.

Subs are kept to a minimum so
the ﬁve get used to each others’
presence on the ﬁeld.

“It’s good to know what ev-
erybody’s going to do before the
play,” Felezzola said.

The line is also close oﬂ" the
ﬁeld, going out to eat together ev-
ery Wednesday night.

With expectations high, prepa-
ration must correspond. The team
holds winter workouts and spring
practice before giving the individ-

ual players workout assignments '

for the summer.
Football is time consuming,
and Division III schools do not

provide athletic scholarships.
What then is the motivation for
playing?

“The love of the game,” Whit-
ﬁeld said, “And of course for all
the ladies.”

“Pretty much the credit goes to
our coach, Gavin Colliton,” Col-
lins said. “He’s made us the men
we are.”

So far the hard work has been
paying off as the team is off to a
2-1 start, defeating Centre 24-15
on Saturday.

“It’s nice to be able to play
when you’re ahead like that,”
Felazzola said.

The Generals led for most of
the game, which included a fourth
quarter deluge that left the ﬁeld
and players muddy. The rain was
so thick it was difﬁcult to see.

Offensive linemen have very
few personal statistics; the team’s
perfonnance is the reﬂection of
their performance as a unit. One
particular number the group keeps
their eyes on is the sack total.

“We didn’t allow many sacks
last year, and that’s something
we’d like to continue,” Felezzola
said.

Contrary to the popular im-
age of the “dumb jock,” offen-
sive linemen have some of the
most mentally challenging re-
sponsibilities of the game. They
must memorize diverse blocking
schemes and apply them in short
order to an ever-shifting defense.

The Generals have a fairly small
offensive line, with no player ap-
proaching the 300 pound mark,
meaning they are oﬁen outsized
by their opponents.

But as Felezzola explains,
there are more important charac-
teristic than size.

“Coach Colliton works with us
a lot on technique so we always
know what to do. We’re also pret-
ty fast.”

This speed and discipline al-
lows the Generals to execute
plays from the shotgun without a
huddle, keeping the defense on its
heels and giving the smaller of-
fensive line the edge.

“We like to run the inside/out-
side zone if we really need a ﬁrst
down,” Felezzola said.

Collins explained the concept.
“In zone blocking everyone is as-
signed to a gap rather than a man,
so we know our steps before the
snap.” For a running back with
good vision, this scheme can open
up multiple lanes for cutbacks.
The team also runs an array of
options, screens, and draws.

There is still a lot of season left

Line unappreciated

Offensive core largely contributes to Generals ’

wild success

and both the line and the team
in general will have plenty of
time to work on their goals.

Some of these, according to
F elezzola, are keeping sacks
low, focusing on every game
one at a time, and not thinking
too far ahead. However he does
concede that the conference
match up with Bridgewater
will be especially signiﬁcant.

It has been said that football
can be reduced to two basic
parts: blocking and tackling.
The difference between the two
on any given play is fought in
the trenches.

This is the aspect of football
that makes it different from any
other sport: players physically
clearing the way for their team-
mates’ success.

So next time you I attend
a football game, gasp at the
amazing catches, the precision
passes, and the spectacular in-
terceptions, but also remember
to take note of the subtleties of
the line. Your football experi-
ence will be all the better for
it.

Soccer wipes out opponents

Men continue undefeated quest, shut out Bridgewater Hampden-Sydney

By Mlke Fahey
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team continued its
dominance over every team it en-
countered, adding two wins this
week to take their record to 6-0.

This is the best start that the
team has had since 2000. The
Generals captured their ﬁﬂh win
over Bridgewater College, 2-0.
W&L had not defeated Bridge-
water since 2001. The Generals
scored their six win of the season
with a 4-0 victory over Hampden-
Sydney.

On Saturday morning, the
Generals got off to a strong start
when junior forward and lead-
ing scorer Jack Palmer scored
off an assist from senior forward
Kyle Garcia. The Generals then
notched three goals in the second
half to put away the Tigers.

Sophomore midﬁelder Tommy
Pignatelli and sophomore mid-
ﬁelder John Lindsay both found

the back of the net for the Gen-
erals, and freshman midﬁelder
Drew Crowley scored his third
goal of the season off a pass from
senior midﬁelder Shep Russell.

Junior goaltender Ted Sheddy
notched his third shutout of the
season tallying ﬁve saves. Sheddy
is a veteran goalie for the Gener-
als, having recorded a record of
7-4-2 and posting a GAA of just
0.93 with a .780 save percentage
last season. This season, Sheddy
has been a force to be reckoned
with a GAA of 0.20 and a .938
save percentage. Sheddy has also
recorded 15 saves so far.

The Generals contest against
Bridgewater game started 05 as
a defensive battle, until the 39th
minute when Crowley scored his
second collegiate goal off a pass
from senior defender Scott Pitt-
man.

The Generals carried their mo-
menmm into the half, with a 1-0
lead. Garcia notched the Gener-
als’ second goal of the game off

an assist from junior midﬁelder
Josh Dodds. Garcia’s goal served
as insurance for the rest of the
game, and the Generals never let
Bridgewater get into the contest.

The Generals have gotten off
to their great start behind leading
scorer Palmer. Palmer has scored
six goals so far this season, while
Crowley and sophomore mid-
ﬁelder Whitt Larkin have been the
Generals second leading scorers
so far recording three goals and
an assist. Palmer led the team in
scoring last season with 11 goals
and 2 assists. He was also named
as a First Team All-ODAC selec-
tion.

Another strong force for
the Generals has been their
defense. All three of the senior
captains are defenders, indicat-
ing the Generals’ backﬁeld is
ﬁlled with skilled veterans. Se-
nior captains JD. McDermott,
Alex Phillips and Scot Pitt-
man have all had a great start
to their season, as the Generals
have only allowed an astonish-
ing two goals as a team.

The Generals will take the
ﬁeld to continue their quest for
an undefeated season on Tues-
day, when the take on non-con-
ference opponent Mary Wash-
ington at 4 p.m. on Watt Field.

Howard avoids juicy temptations

By Adam Lewls
STAFF WRITER

New Home Run Champ?

Okay, so it’s mid-September,
and if you’re not engrossed in the
thrill of preseason hockey, you
are most likely focused on foot-

ball, both
NCAA and
NFL. And
while both

sports are off
to exciting
starts, one
can’t help
but notice
that baseball
is still in full
force, and amidst an intense NL
Wild Card race, one Ryan How-
ard is emerging as an MVP candi-
date, with 57 home runs through
149 games.

“So what?” you may say.
“Fiﬁy-seven home runs with two
weeks leﬁ? Big deal. Didn’t
Bany, Mark, and Sammy have,
like, 65 by now?” And yes, that
would be correct. But before you
go back to watching the Canucks
battle the Flames, let’s take a bet-
ter look at this.

Let us begin with Barry Bonds.
If you have kept up with news and
evidence surrounding Bonds, you
will know that he shares the same
slogan as Juicy Juicem (“100%
Juice”). Okay, maybe that was
speculation, as it has not been
“proven” that he knowingly took
steroids (other than “The Cream”
and “The Clear” of course). Then
let me say, using political correct-
ness, that there has been much
controversy surrounding Bonds
involving his alleged use of per-
formance enhancing drugs. Blah
blah blah. No matter which way
you look at it, somehow at age
37, Bonds’ head randomly grew
one full size and his body made
the Hulk’s look average. So, for
arg1ment’s sake, I am assuming
he did a little more than alter his
diet and work out routine, and
thus temporarily erasing his 73
home run season from the record
books.

Next, we have Mark McGwire.
His case is simple. In 1998, when
he broke Maris’ record of 61 home
runs (for the ﬁrst time), he admit-

 

ted to using Androstenedione,
which is a dietary drug that had
been banned by the NFL already,
despite not yet being prohibited
by the MLB. With that said, it is
now clear that whether the drug
was illegal or not at that time, it
signiﬁcantly enhanced one’s per-
formance, thus, I will again tem-
porarily remove his marks of 70
home runs in 1998, and 65 home
runs in 1999.

Lastly, we have “Slammin’”
Sammy Sosa, who broke Maris’
record three times. When the
steroid scandals began to leak
out, his name was one of the ﬁrst
to be circulated, along with the
other afore-mentioned sluggers.
Though we cannot be sure wheth-
er he used performance enhancers,
a dramatic decline in his power
totals following the scandals may
indicate that he did. Additionally,
he was involved in the infamous

.“corked bat incident,” which says

enough on his potential to cheat,
and as a result, let’s say good—bye
to the 66, 64, 63 home runs sea-
sons he put up.

So what does this leave us
with? Well, besides the fact that
we have three players whose bi-
ceps have their own zip codes,
we also are left with a Mr. Ryan
Howard and his 57 home runs.
Granted, he still must hit four
more to tie Maris, but for the sake
of arguing, let’s assume he reach-
es and surpasses that point.

In the minds of most baseball
fans, a deﬁnite certainty is needed
for them to discount statistics,
especially those of the game’s
greatest sluggers. And that in it-
self makes it very difficult to sud-
denly erase records, or even place
an asterisk next to them. So with
that in mind, I am not asking you
to pretend that Bonds, McGwire,
and Sosa didn’t squash Maris’
record (with their juiced up bot-
toms), but rather I am asking you
to merely consider the evidential
support, and then see the new re-
sult.

Ladies and gentlemen, I am
proud to announce to you the (po-
tential) new single season home
run champ: Ryan Howard.

(Well, at least until they start
testing for human growth hor-
mones).

Volleyball struggles at Emory

Women defeat one of four at invitational in Atlanta, fall to ﬁrst ODAC opponent

The Generals ended their play
at the Emory Invitational last
weekend in Atlanta, Ga. 1-3.

Alter early success on Friday
against Rockford College 3-0

op“; (30-22, 30-24, 30-
reeom 23), the Generals fell
3_1 to opponents from

Emory University on
Friday and Carthage
College and Randolph—Macon
College on Saturday.

Against all three contenders,
the Generals did not secure a sin-
gle match.

The closest game came on
Saturday aftemoon against Ran-
doph-Macon with scores of 25-
30, 25-30 and 27-30. This was
the ﬁrst ODAC loss this season
that adjusted their ODAC record
to 3-1.

With only two seniors and two
juniors, the young volleyball team
has overcome a disadvantage in
experience, already winning eight
of its 12 games.

“There are quite a few new
people ﬁlling starting positions,”
senior captain Ashley Hurt said.
“Our play has improved since we
ﬁrst started, but there are still a lot
of things we have to work on.”

One reason for their strong
record is the enthusiasm and sup-
port of the senior captains.

“The senior captains encour-
age and push every player to be
the best they can be,” freshman
Rachael Phillips said. “Even if we
made a mistake, they cheer us on
and give us conﬁdence.”

According to Phillips, the
freshmen bring new possibilities
and ideas to the team.

“The freshmen have really
