wo of Wasliington and I_cc's
fraternities have been placed
on critical probation following
hazing incidents.

George llunter. president of Kappa
Sigma, conﬁrmed that his organization
was placed on critical probation following
a meeting of the Student Affairs Commit-
tee (SAC) on Tuesday March 13.

Phi Gamma Delta president Andrew
Rothey conﬁrmed that i‘I.ll has received
twelve months probation as well.

Both cases were ﬁrst heard by the Inter-
fraternity Council. According to the Win-
ter edition of “W&L Greek Life News."
the IFC determined that Kappa Sigma had
“asked their new members to stand outside
in cold weather for approximately an hour
on two occasions" and that FIJI had asked
“new members to consume a concoction
of condiments.” As a result of these inci-
dents, the IFC suspended both chapters:
new member education.

The IFC thcnjtrdged the violations seri-
ous enough to warrant referring the case to
SAC, as the Student Handbook mandates.

SAC is an organization of students and
faculty chaired by Dawn Watkins, Dean of

Students. It primarily serves as a forum for
campus leaders to discuss and debate is-

,sues relating to student life, but it also has

an atljudieatirc role.

According to the Student Handbook.
SAC has oversight over student judicial
proceedings that would involve “the pos-
sible suspension or dismissal of a frater-
nity or sorority, or placing a fraternity or
sorority on critical probation."

The IFC recommended both fraterni-
ties be placed on critical orobation for one
year; critical probation carries no speciﬁc
penalty, and is instead customized to the
specific situation.

“You’re trying to tailor [the critical
probation to] whatever the concern is to
make the organization the best it can be,”
said Dean Watkins.

“Critical probation presents a myriad of
other complications that regular probation
doesn’t entail. In a hazing incident in par-
ticular, nationals are usually involved at
a high level,” said IFC President Andrew
Flannigan, a member of the SAC. “While
[the IFC] takes hazing seriously, [the na-
tionals] take it even more seriously.”

In this case, the IFC recommended the
critical probation mandate a shortened pe-
riod ofpledgeship for both fraternities next

year. According to the “W&L Greek Life

News,” the IFC wanted initiation to take
place in both fraternities before Washing-
ton Break and to be supervised by their na-
tiorrals. ."‘.\l‘.iitl~‘.‘llLlll>, their nationals would
be asked to hold mandatory meetings with
the membership this year to discuss new
member education and membership devel-
opment.

Kappa Sigma‘s Hunter confirmed that
next years pledgcship has been shortened,
but said its actual length has yet to be de-
cided.

Complicating matters is the strict con-
ﬁdentiality surrounding the particulars of
the case; all parties involved. including
witnesses. are informed that any breach of
conﬁdentiality is “a violation of both fed-
eral law and standards of the Washington
and Lee University community.”

This has been frustrating for some.
Commentators in the student media have
criticized the accuracy of recent hazing
reports, and the participation of faculty
through organizations like SAC has led
some to question the extent that student
self—governance is a reality at W&L.

“The decision ofhow to adjudicate fra-
temity matters should rest solely with the
student body,“ said Max Courtney, FIJl’s

how the process works:

- Information about a hazing violation reaches
Jason Rodocker, Director of Student Activities and
Greek Life, or the lnterfraternity Council (IFC).

- At the request of Rodocker or the IFC, Director
of Public Safety Mike Young conducts an
investigation of the allegations. Young typically
interviews pledges and pledge trainers.

- Once Young has completed his investigation, he
presents his finding at a meeting of the IFC.

-After hearing evidence from Young and the
fraternity, the IFC Judicial Board decides if the

fraternity is guilty.

- If the fraternity is found guilty, the IFC imposes
a punishment that can range from a warning to

dismissal of a fraternity.

- If the lFC’s suggested punishment would put the
fraternity on critical probation, then the case must
be heard by the Student Affairs Committee (SAC).

- The SAC meets with members of the fraternity
then ratifies or modifies the lFC’s suggested

punishment.

Senator John Warner Speaks Friday night about public service and the Shepherd Poverty Program

By Jacob Geiger

Warner’s help.

MANAGING EDITOR

Senator John Wamer’s visit to
campus on Friday is more than
just a homecoming for the Class
of 1949 alumnus. The visit also
marks another important mile-

. stone for Washington and Lee's

Shepherd Poverty Program.

Warner e Virginia’s senior
senator — has been working with
W&L professor Harlan Beckley
to seek federal funding that will
help the program expand to other
schools.‘

Since Beckley founded the
Shepherd Program at W&L. hun-
dreds of students have taken his
Poverty 101 class and more than

200 students have participated in,

eight-week summer internships.

Beckley wants to do more. The
Shepherd Program at W&L has
proposed a ﬁve year project to
establish similar programs at ten
other schools. -

The new program would com-
bine classroom work with the
summer internships pioneered
by W&L’s Shepherd students.
Currently, students from Berea
College, Morehouse College and
Spelman College are part of the
Shepherd Alliance participate in
the summer internships. but the
colleges have not yet been able
to add an academic component in
poverty.

“The alliance has existed since
the inception of the program. but
those schools don’t have an aca-
demic program that complements

“You cannot pass legislation without key Sen-

ate and House members, and [Warner] is cer-

tainly one of those people. ”

HARLAN BECKLEY, Director of the Shepherd Poverty Program

it” Beckley said. “The consortium
schools L1i‘c' hopefully going to be
adding the academic program and
service side at the same time."
Some members of the pro-
posed consortium include Van-
derbilt. Georgetown. Middlebury.
the University ofRichmond, Mor-
gan State University and the Uni-
versity of Arkansas—Little Rock.
Morgan State and UA—Little Rock
are public universities, while the

other schools are private institu-
tions.

Beckley said the program
could not expand without help
from Warner and the federal
govermnent, There is currently
a proposal before both houses of
Congress that would authorize
the consortium to receive fed-
eral funding. Once that approval
passes, the consortium will ap-
proach the House and Senate Ap-

' propriations Committees to ask

for funding.

“[Wamer]’s provided indis-
pensable help,” Beckley said.
“You cannot pass legislation
without‘ key Senate and House
members, and he’s certainly one
ofthose people.”

On Friday Warner will speak
at a 4:00 pm. forum in the Com-
mons’ Stackhouse Theater before
delivering an address at 6:30 p.m.
in Lee Chapel.

The afternoon forum will also
feature remarks from Tom Shep-
herd — a founding contributor of
the program ~ and from several
students active in the program.

Senior Sam Wilmoth said he
is both excited and nervous about
speaking after Warner.

“There are the people who

persuade for a living,” Wilmoth
said. “lt’s both exciting and in-
timidating.”

Wilmoth did his Shepherd cap-
stone project on access to higher
education. Since he completed
the project while Beckley was
serving as W&L’s acting presi-
dent, Wilmoth worked with eco-
nomics professor Art Goldsmith.

Wilmoth also completed a
summer internship with the Wash-
ington, D.C. public defender’s of-
ﬁee.

“I was an investigative intern,
so I spent my time ﬁnding wit-
nesses, serving subpoenas, tak-
ing statements and photographing
crime scenes,” he said. “I loved
it.”

Kickoff dates set

Mock Con kickoﬁ’ will include concert by Gov ’t Mule

Bysacha Raab
STAFF WRITER

Fancy Dress isn’t the only im-
portant l00‘“ anniversary celebra-
tion this year. Washington and
Lee’s Mock Convention, which
happens to be the most accurate
mock convention in the country,
is planning its Spring Kickoff to
the 2008 Convention as a week-
end-long festival from May 25 to
26.

The Convention, entirely stu-
dent-run, began in 1908 when
William Jennings Bryan came
to visit Lexington. The students
held a realist convention for the
Democratic Party in his honor.

The 1908 convention correctly
predicted that Bryan would win
the Democratic nomination, but
the convention was also marred
by ﬁghts in the aisles.

Subsequent conventions have
been friendlier affairs.

The group holds a convention
each election year for the party
out of power, which this year is
the Democrats. The regional and
state chairs conduct a research
into the primary candidates to
determine which candidate each
state will support.

Washington and Lee’s Mock

“Since 2008 will be our 1 00 year anniversary, -

we want to set the tone for Spring Kickoff to

make it bigger and better ’

}

RICHARD FRIEDMAN, Mock Convention General Chair
 

Convention has a long history of
success, as it has only guessed
wrong once since I948. Wes Lit-
tle, the Political Chairman, claims
that “by next January, over 90%
of the W&L student body will be
involved with Mock Convention
and we will be the largest student
organization on campus.”

Including the steering and
executive committees, about 90
people are already working on
the convention. When the state
and regional chairs are added to
the mix, close to 200 people have
gotten involved.

The Spring Kickoff, which
takes place the spring before the
actual Convention, has typically
consisted of a day of prominent
speakers followed by a band’s
performance. This year, however,
will be different. Mock Conven-
tion General Chairman Richard
Friedman, said, “Since 2008 will

be our 100 year anniversary, we
want to set the tone for Spring
Kickoff to make it bigger and bet-
ter.”

Social Chair Jackie Neilson
said, “This year, we really want
to go above and beyond to cre-
ate a weekend—long event that
the campus will respond to and
want to attend. Spring Kickoff in
general is a big kick start to the
Mock Convention, so the events
themselves are designed to get
the student body excited about the
convention and, for me, the social
events that come along with it
over the next year.”

The Wednesday before the
major speakers are presented,
the College Republicans and the
Young Democrats hold a debate
concerning the issues in the pri-
mary and general elections.

Over the weekend there will
also be a Presidential Issues panel

Wilmoth eventually hopes to
study law, and he said the Shep-
herd program has changed the
way he’ll approach his future ca-
reer

“It’s altered the way I view a
job as meaningful,” he said. “I
couldn’t go work at a big ﬁrm and
make lots of money if I didn’t feel
like I was helping people.”

Wilmoth said he did not know
if he would go into public de-
fense.

“It is something I’ve consid-
ered,” he said. “We all have dif-
ferent gifts to give, and the key is
ﬁguring out how we can make a
contribution.”

Warner spokesman John Ul-
lyot said Warner has been work-
ing with the Shepherd program
since its early years.

3 He said Wamer’s time at W&L
helped shape his political actions
as well as his support for the
Shepherd Program.

“Senator Warner has always
supported the principle of giv-
ing back to the community and
the less fortunate,” Ullyot said.
“When he was a lawyer at Hogan
and Hartson they had a strong
pro-bono program that the Sena-
tor participated in.”

Warner ’s speech in Lee Chapel
will address how honor and civili-
ty play ﬁt with public service. Ul-
lyot said Warner saw strong honor

“The strong background of
honor and propriety that was
formed at W&L has served [War-
ner] well in the Senate,” Ullyot
said.

“Senator Warner has said that
W&L and the honor system are a
bedrock in his background.”

Though the Shepherd Con-
sortium is still waiting for fund-
ing from the federal government,
Beckley said the program keeps
expanding.

“We’ve already grown,” Beck-
ley said. “Programs are begin-
ning at John Carroll University in
Cleveland and at Rice University.
Barylor and Furrnan are also con-
sidering programs similar to the
consortium, but that depends on
the level of funding they have
available.” '

Wilmoth said he wants to see
the program keep expanding.

love to see spread across the
country,” he said. “We need to
solve the problems of poverty
and move it to the forefront of
national discussion.”

Jarding, Ike Allen, and Larry
Sabato.

Sabato, a UVa politics pro-
fessor, is well known for his
extremely accurate election pre-
dictions. He often appears on
the major cable networks to of-
fer election analysis.

The weekend has more than
just policical discussions. Will
Owens, the event’s second social
chair, says, “We are excited to
announce that Gov’t Mule will
help kick off the Mock Conven-
tion this spring term. Given their
ﬁtting name and musical creden-
tials, I don’t think we could have
asked for a better way to start the
Mock Convention.”

Gov’t Mule member Warren
Haynes is best known from the
Allman Brothers Band. With
the help of GAB, this Grammy
nominated band will play out-
doors on Cannan Green Satur-
day, May 26.

Though the actual Conven-
tion is still 10 months away, the
political staff is maintaining a
blog that is updated about 2-3

times per day to keep the stu-«

dent body posted on both Spring
Kickoff plans and important po-
litical news.

senior pledge trainer. He called
for a Blue Book review commit-
tee made up of students to revise
current judicial policy.

“SAC ’s involvement. . .
[suppresses] the voice of the stu-
dent body,” he said.

The IF C ’s Flannigan, however,
said established procedure must
be followed. “You can’t commit
the wrong and then change the
rules. The rules of the game are
established at the onset of new
member education, he said.”

“Everybody knows them,”
Dean Watkins added. “Hazing
is inconsistent with the values
of theuniversity and the values
espoused by every fraternity at
W&L.”

Director of Student Activities
and Greek Life Jason Rodocker
said, “The student body needs to
address the attitude that ‘we will
do bad things to new members be-
cause it was done to us when we
were new members,”’ he said.

Nevertheless, Rodocker ex-
pressed conﬁdence in the Greek
system’s ability to move forward
from these hazing investigations
and severe sanctions in a con-
structive and eductational man-
ner: “College is an educational
process and it is expected that
students will make mistakes...

admit [them], accept the con-'

sequences, and change your be-
havior accordingly.  The ulti-
mate goal is to move the campus
community and its individuals
in the right direction.”

“The IFC’s handling of the
investigations during new mem-
ber education is a great example
of student‘ governance,” he add-
ed.

Dean Watkins concurs. “I
think the Greek system’s in re-
ally good shape... I’m seeing
an IFC that’s doing its job and
fraternities that are responding
well to working with the IF C...
that ’s a Greek system that is ever
mindful of how to address con-
cerns and build on strengths.”

Hunter, the Kappa Sigma
president, said he thought the
judicial system worked in a fair
and efficient manner.

“The disciplinary process
within the university is delib-
erate and efﬁcient, and works
as it is intended. We had great
experiences dealing with Jason
Rodocker, Dean Watkins, Dean
Dotson, and the SAC... Really,
we’re just excited to have the
situation behind us, and to move
forward.”

That’s certainly a sentiment
Watkins shares. “I want to see
a healthy Greek system and
healthy students,” she said.

THE RING-TUM PHI ° 3

 

’->7

With Senator John Warner
coming to campus this week-
end to speak about public ser-
vice and the Shepherd Pov-
erty Program, this seems like
a good time to let the campus
in on a little secret.

While the rest of us have
been busy worrying about
Fancy Dress and Mock Con-
vention, Professor Harlan
Beckley has quietly been
changing the poverty program
from a small department into
a national project.

Beckley started the Shep-
herd program in 1997. A de-
cade later, he has the program
poised to expand to at least
ten schools. If Warner is able
to obtain the federal funding
that he’s working to garner,
the consortium could be up
and running within just a few
years. If the first ﬁve years of

"the project go well, the pro-
gram has the deﬁnite potential
to keep expanding.

There is little doubt that
Beckley’s work has solidiﬁed
his reputation as one of the
school’s most respected pro-
fessors, and it’s not surprising

that Beckley was selected to
serve as W&L’s acting-presi-
dent last year when Tom Bur-
ish left for Notre Dame.

W&L’s social scene might
be famous across the South,
but the Shepherd program
may soon make the school
famous nationwide, and for
far more important and mean-
ingful reasons. The Shepherd
interns who serve in the D.C.
Public Defender’s ofﬁce or
the D.C. Central Kitchen are
exposing thousands of Ameri-
cans — from people in abject
poverty to U.S. Senators ~ to
our school.

The Shepherd program is
doing more than just helping
people far from Lexington.
Though the Campus Kitch-
ens Project operates inde-
pendently of Beckley and the
Shepherd alliance, it is show-
ing Rockbridge County that
our school has more to it than
noisy country parties.

Beckley knows that not all
students in his Poverty 101
class or evenin the Shepherd
program will devote their ca-
reers to eradicating poverty.

He’s ﬁne with that.

What Beckley really wants
to do is make W&L students
aware that poverty exists as
a serious — if sometimes hid-
den — issue in American soci-
ety. He’s succeeding with this
goal, and people beyond the
walls of this campus are start-
ing to notice.

People in the business
world know about the high
quality graduates the Wil-
liams School produces each
year. Medical schools admit
W&L students at levels far
exceeding the national aver-
age. The journalism depart-
ment has a two-time Pulitzer
Prize winner and another pro-
fessor who is regularly quoted
by the New York Times on
ethics issues.

These departments have
long enjoyed a strong reputa-
tion in their respective ﬁelds.
Now Beckley and the Shep-
herd program are joining them
in national circles.

As this groundbreaking
program expands, W&L stu-
dents need to stop and thank
its founder.

Celebrating the
unsung generals

March 21 gala recognizes behind-the-scenes students

By Grace Andrews
0 0 L U M N IST

As many Washington and Lee
University students are aware, we
are volunteer-a-holics.

Everyone has a friend who
volunteers at Waddell, tutors at
the high school or and even reads
to little ones at the library. It al-
most seems as if service is a built
in requirement to graduate here.

However, some of us also
know those individuals who only
volunteer to make themselves
look better and build up their re-
sumes.

You have probably seen him
or her half-heartedly doing volun-
teer work when they think no one
is watching, but as soon as you
add an audience, they are super
volunteer.

Let me present an example.
So, there’s an old lady cross-
ing the street. She is so old that
it looks like she may have went
to grade school with Plato. She is
walking a little slow and her little
old lady arms are weighed down
with large grocery sacks.

The “I only volunteer to build
my resume” looks around and if
no one is there, the phony helper
will walk right past the grandma
and proceed across the street.

However, the “I volunteer and
help out because I care” will stop
whatever they are doing to grab
granny’s bags and hold her hand
as they cross the street together.

Do you see the difference be-
tween these two people?

DING DING DING, one is

One is a truly selfless person while
the other may deserve to get hit with
a I 0-speed mountain bike.

truly a selﬂess person while the
other may deserve to get hit with
a 10-speed mountain bike.

For those of you who do vol-
unteer and/or provide a service
to others, I want to thank you.
Helping is deﬁnitely one of the
best things that you can do and
the feeling that it gives you is in-
valuable.

For those of you who do not
volunteer or do volunteer sans
pep in your step, I recommend
that you step it up. As cliché as
it is, by helping others you help
yourself and that is what life is all
about.

So many organizations and
clubs on campus do worthwhile
activities and raise awareness
on various issues. Being a part
of these organizations is another
way to provide a service for our
campus. Who knows, you may
discover the hidden leader within
yourself.

One day when you are old and
decrepit, don’t you want to look
back on your youth with pride?
How can you do that if all you did
was party and fall asleep in class?
There are endless possibilities for
helping around our campus, so
there is no excuse not to.

Thankfully our campus has

more of those selﬂess types than
anything else. I would like to in-
vite everyone reading this article
to attend the Celebrating Student
Success Gala on March 21 at
6:30p.m. in Lee Chapel.

W&L strives to be an active
and vibrant community. Our stu-
dent leaders are often at the core
of this excitement.

The Celebrating Student Suc-
cess Initiative recognizes those
students who contribute to uni-
versity life in ways often not seen
to the average on-looker. A joint
student-staff committie sought
the “un-sung heroes” who work
hard behind the scenes to make
W&L all that it is.

We celebrate all of their
achievements by presenting the
“John W. Elrod Unsung General
of the Year Award”, and have
planned a campus wide awards
ceremony in Lee Chapel.

This unique initiative provides
a means of celebrating the accom-
plishments of a diverse group of
students in a campus assembly,
providing a spotlight on the good
things our students provide both
to the campus and the wider Lex-
ington community.

No phony helper types will be
celebrated, only the real deals.

Lee on the IFC, hazing

Fraternities should decide what deﬁnes hazing in a Greek honor system

By Cody Beauchamp

The IFC has come under criti-
cism lately for the way it attempt-
ed to handle and discourage haz-
ing during Washington and Lee’s
latest “New Member Education”
period (i.e.: “pledgeship”).

Joining in as targets of criti-
cism were the fraternities, pledg-
es, administrators, and, well, just
about everybody else

It seems that no one is very
satisﬁed by the way hazing was
prevented during pledgeship. No
one seemed very happy with the
transparency—more appropri-
ately the lack thereof—that the
IFC and co. showed this year in
investigating and punishing haz-
ing violations.

During the last eight weeks
rumors ﬂew everywhere; on any
given day, it seemed any given
fraternity was being investigated.

The IFC took a lot of heat for
not being forthcoming in how
they were handling various ac-
cusations of hazing. When they
did come forward, they were met
with criticism. They worked hard,
did their best, and still seemed to
please no one. (I didn’t know the
IF C was a pledge.)

Next year they should save
themselves all this trouble by tak-
ing a very R.E. Lee approach to
hazing—no tolerance for infrac-
tions, whatsoever.

If a fraternity is found to have
hazed their pledges, they should
be immediately dismissed from
the school, for a period of at least
four years. President Lee would
probably say indeﬁnitely, but that
would never ﬂy with the IF C.

The IFC, for its part, should
not codify what is or is not haz-
ing. Like the EC, it should rather

The IF C should rather seek to rule
based on what is believes the current
generation would deﬁne as hazing.

seek to rule based on what it be-
lieves the current generation of
Greeks would deﬁne hazing to be.
It would be a Greek honor “sys-
tem,” not “code.”

Like the Honor System, the fra-
ternities should be able to appeal
to the wider population that the
IFC represents. Not to the SAC;
it’s my opinion that they, frankly,
should be no more involved in my
fratemity’s internal business than
MSA, the Club Ultimate Frisbee
Team or any other non-Greek or-
ganization for that matter.

If the IF C rules a fraternity
guilty, the organization should be
able to appeal the decision in a
hearing open to all Greeks.

Again, independents, by their
own election to stay independent,
have absolutely no right to be in-
volved in Greek business. Sorry,
indies, if that’s harsh. A panel of
randomly selected fellow Greeks
should be able to review the IFC’s
decision following the hearing.

Like in the regular honor sys-
tem, the fraternity should have to
make a sacriﬁce for its appeal——
the fraternity loses its right to pri-
vacy concerning its actions.

If the fraternity believes its
super-secret version of a line-up
isn’t hazing, it shouldn’t be dis-
missed without the chance to ap-
peal—but it doesn’t get to keep it
a secret.

It’s a rough deal, but then
again, the pledges involved could

probably tell you about rough
deals. Get over it.

The beneﬁts of this approach
would solve almost all of the cur-
rent system’s problems.

To begin with, the fratemities
would be on their best behavior.
There would be no toeing-the-
line because A) the fraternities
wouldn’t know exactly where the
line is, and B) they would be ter-
riﬁed of crossing it. .

Alternatively, much like the
honor system for students, the
fraternities would be given com-
plete discretion over their actions
as long as the trust invested in the
fraternity isn’t violated.

If this generation’s fratemi-
ties don’t see branding the lyrics
to “Sweet Caroline” on the fore-
heads of their members as hazing,
it wouldn’t be considered such
and the frats would be allowed
to do what they have no problem
with.

On the other side of the spec-
trum, if this generation of Greeks
decides that making pledges know
the full name of their own frater-
nity offends their general senti-
ments too much, they would de-
ﬁne that as hazing and it wouldn’t
be allowed.

This works for all involved-
the Greek community gets to col-
lectively decide what it deems
acceptable. The fraternity gets to
appeal. The IFC as meddlcr or
protector (depending on whether

or .not your fraternity is under
accusation) must justify its deci-
sions to the population it serves.

Outside of Greek life, students
of W&L have all agreed to live by
a system of honor. It’s a delicate
and potentially-harsh system, but
we elect to live by it because it
works.

It’s not the easiest thing to do,
but we all do it because in agree-
ing to hold ourselves to the highest
standards, we also get the greatest
amounts of trust and discretion
from everyone else pledged to
that system.

Why not adopt General Lee’s
approach to life to the Greek
system? If the Greeks all are the
upstanding organizations they
profess to be, why should we not
hold them accountable by a simi-
lar set of standards to the one we
as individuals live by?

Hazing would be eradicated
by the specter of a penalty analo-
gous to the penalties that eradi-
cate cheating and stealing. At the
same time, the fraternities would
be given the discretion they de-
sire.

The IFC and administration
also beneﬁts from having a far
more concretely-deﬁned role.
Even pledges beneﬁt from the
system because it would ensure
that their future brothers treat
them with the respect brothers
should show one another.

When it comes to living hon-
orably, we don’t place individuals
on super-extra-serious-we-really-
REALLY-mean-it-this-time pro-
bation.

If they violate our communal
trust, we expel them from our
community. Should the collec-
tions of these individuals called
“fratemities” or “sororities” be
any different?

Tragic romance arrived from Russia

Last week, the Len-
fest Series featured
professional balleri-
nas from Moscow in
two performances in
the Keller Theater.
This event was made
possible largely by a
generous donation
from the class of
1964. Tuesday night,
the group performed
Don Quixote, a
romantic and adven-
turous performance
of Cervantes’ literary
work. On Wednes-
day, the group
performed Giselle
(all photos taken

at the Wednesday
night performance
of Giselle). Dancers
stunned spectators
as they acted out the
sad story of Giselle,
a peasant woman
who is in love with a
nobleman in dis-
guise, Loys. Though r
Giselle believes him
to be a peasant, the
man's true name

is Albrecht, and

he is engaged to a
woman of his own
class. When Giselle
discovers this truth,
she dies of a broken

heart. Giselle is able

to return temporar-
ily to save Albrecht
from the evils of
Wilis, who appears
to make him suffer.
She spares him and
offers her forgive-
ness for his decep-
tion. They declare
their love for one
another, but Giselle
must return to her
grave. Their love is
established, but the
tragedy remains that
they will be physi-
cally apart. The Mos-
cow Festival Ballet
company was formed
in 1989 by Sergei
Radchenko and is
comprised of talent-
ed Russian dancers.
It has completed two
tours of Europe in
the last two decades.
The company began
extensively touring
in the United States
in 1997. Along with
Giselle and Don Quix-
ote, the company
performs ballets

like Cinderella and
Romeo and Juliet.

Spoken word calls for action

Actors emphasize signiﬁcance of individual contributions by Americans in Darfur crisis

By Jess Ramos
STAFF WRITER

Poetry, rap and drama are the
new methods to promote action
and awareness towards the crisis
in Darfur.

Last Tuesday, Chapmyn Spo-
ken Word presented “The Road to
Darfur,” a choreopoem by James
H. Chapmyn. Chapmyn Spoken
Word, headed by James H. Chap-
myn, is a three-man acting troupe

“Each of us is re-
sponsible for do-
ing what we can to
change thelworld. ”

CHAPMYN SPOKEN WORD,
actors raisng awareness

that uses different performance
styles and multimedia to convey
important messages and issues.

The Student Association for
International Learning (SAIL)
and Amnesty International spon-
sored Chapmyn Spoken Word’s
appearance at Washington and
Lee. However, this is not the ﬁrst
time events raising awareness for
Darfur have surfaced on campus.

This past November, Wash-
ington and Lee’s Amnesty Inter-
national chapter raised awareness
about Darfur, selling t-shirts say-
ing “Save Darfur.” Some Am-
nesty members also fasted for 24
hours.

Around the same time, SAIL
put together “Showcase for Su-

Panelists promote female leaders

dan,” a talent show. In addition
to raising awareness about Dar-
fur, “Showcase for Sudan” raised
about $1,000 for the victims in
Darfur.

Chapmyn’s choreopoem, “The
Road to Darfur,” focused on the
present-day genocide in western
Sudan’s Darfur region. Accord-
ing to a United Nations report,
two million Darfurians have been
displaced and over 400,000 have
been killed.

While most people are familiar
with statistics, Chapmyn Spoken
Word presented the information
in a new way. Images of Darfur’s
human suffering combined with
singing, poetry and drama provid-
ed another approach to empower,
engage, encourage and entertain.
Through their unique presenta-
tion, Chapmyn Spoken Word en-
couraged audience members to be
aware and to act.

To Chapmyn Spoken Word,
awareness meant grappling with
the hypocrisy in silence. “People
are dying because people don’t
care,” said Chapmyn. Chapmyn
Spoken Word highlighted the hy-
pocrisy that exists everywhere.
The Sudanese government denies
the genocide, leading to suspicions
that the government is behind the
militia groups responsible.

The United States deplores the
genocide, yet the lust .fox;..money
and power impede it from stop-
ping the genocide, said Chapmyn
Spoken Word. Dependence on
Sudanese oil furthers greed and
ﬁnances genocide. Yet, as part of
the global community, everyone
is connected and equally respon-
sible for ending this crisis. Since
the time of King, Gandhi and So-
journer Truth, Chapmyn Spoken

MICHAEL KEENAN / Staff Photographer

Chapmyn Spoken Word performers engage viewers last Tuesday to encourage individual action in Darfur crlsls.

Word said today’s technology has
made it possible to act against this
genocide.

Though “the road to Darfur
is paved with silence,” one can
overcome hypocrisy through ac-
tions, said Chapmyn Spoken
Word. By not buying Sudanese
oil, the world has stopped ﬁnanc-
ing genocide. For individual ac-
tion, Chapmyn Spoken Word of-

fered two ways to help.

First, one must hold the sell-
ers and manufacturers account-
able, challenging them to make
their products better. An example
Chapmyn Spoken Word used was
the numerous little tags in cloth-
ing, when only one tag is needed.
Creating better products more ef-
ﬁciently diminishes dependence
on Sudanese oil. One must also

make people around them aware
by talking about this issue and
holding each other accountable.
Though deceptively insigniﬁ-
cant, the individual ideas and ac-
tions inﬂuence groups, which in
turn inﬂuence larger institutions
to act. A recent CNN.com story
posted on March 14, 2007 stated
that the U.S. government is now
preparing to impose new eco-

nomic sanctions upon Sudanese
companies.

Although individual action is
on a small scale, all little actions
combined can change the world.
By listening to the “inner voice,”
one can do miracles. Every indi-
vidual has a purpose, said Chap-
myn Spoken Word. “Each of us
is responsible for doing what we
can to change the world.”

KEWL hosted a panel last Thursday to showcase accomplishments and obstacles facing women leaders on this campus

By Jessica Shaw
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

Professor Pam Simpson
equated her early years to a
trial.

In I973, she entered a sea of
testosterone as the ﬁrst female
professor at Washington and
Lee. At times struggling to meet
her rent, Simpson experienced
rejection from local banks that
refused to loan money to wom-
en because of their supposed in-
ability to be trusted in the work-
force. At work, Simpson was
overwhelmed with frustration
that her opinion was drowned
out by male voices around her.

“That’s kind of the dark days
of discrimination,” she said.
“Anytime I said something,
nobody listened. Then the law
dean would repeat what I said,
and then they’d hear it.”

Though the road was rocky,
Simpson said the path to gender
equality in this community has
been overwhelmingly positive.
She was able to relate her strug-
gles and accomplishments to a
small audience in the Commons
Theater last Thursday night.

Joining Simpson on the panel
hosted by Knowledge Empow-
ering Women Leaders (KEW),
were deans Dawn Watkins and
Elizabeth Knapp, romance lan-
guages professor Domnica Rad-
ulescu and students Justine Dar-
gahi and Margaret Elkins.

All six panelists expressed _

to their audience that women
have made leaps and bounds in

“If women students are not seeing women in

leadership roles, that sends such a message.

That sends a message that that :9 not what wom-

en are doing, and that’s not the right message.

DAWN WATKINS, dean of student affairs
 

the direction of equality, but that
there is still much to be desired.

A big push by KEWL in the
past year has been to gain more
female representation in the ad-
ministration.

Watkins agreed with this idea,
saying, “If women students are
not seeing women in leadership
roles, that sends such a message.
That sends a message that that’s
not what women are doing, and
that’s not the right message.”

Knapp, a graduate of the
second co-ed class at W&L,
said she beneﬁted tremendously
from having female role models
and mentors.

“I had never really worked
with or been educated by a
woman with family,” she said.
“I remember being terriﬁed
watching this woman who did
an amazing job in every area of
her life and see that all of these
things are attainable. It really
changed my belief in myself
and what I could do.”

Watkins said that it is cru-
cial to represent a diversity of
perspectives in administrative
roles. ‘

“I think it’s across the board

that there are different perspec-
tives that need to be represent-
ed, because things just getileft
out of the equation,” she said.
“There are things that will just
get missed.”

Elkins, who recently ran for
president of the Executive Com-
mittee, said it was difﬁcult for
her to compete with her male
counterparts.

“It was really difﬁcult to be
assertive and feel like I was
taken seriously, even if I was,”
she said. “I think especially on
this campus for some reason,
especially running against these
other great male leaders, it’s re-

ally hard.”

Watkins commended Elkins
for entering the election.

“The fact that Margaret ran
sends a signal that it’s okay that
women are running,” she said.
“We’ve got to encourage other
women to run again and again
and again. And women will sue-
ceed; they have in the past, and
they will in the future.”

Radelescu, the co-founder of
the Women’s Studies Program
at W&L, said she wants to see
this discipline grow.

“I would like to bring the
Women’s Studies Program in
sync with other women’s stud-
ies programs at competitive in-
stitutions,” she said.

“I would like to see the pro-
gram become a major-—right
now it’s a concentration. I would
like to help it push into that next
level.”

Responding to a question

about advice to give females on I

campus, Radelescue said it is
important to be the best at what-
ever one pursues. She explained

that this makes discrimination
a fun challenge, because one is
equipped to dispel it.

“Don’t let society and the
world tell you that you can’t be
what you are,” she said, “And
that you can’t have family and
a career, because look at us; we
have all of that.”

Regina Mills, the vice presi-
dent of KEWL, acknowledges
the signiﬁcance of the message
of female leaders for both men
and women at W&L.

“I think one, it’s important to
get it to men--to have them rec-
ognize that women leadership is
a priority and a necessity,” Mills
said. “And for women, it’s to
see these role models of these
women who are in power and to
take their example and empower
themselves and to say, ‘hey, this
is right, I think I should ﬁght for

this.’”

All of the panelists expressed
excitement about the appoint-
ment of new provost, June
Aprille. Paten Hughes, Presi-
dent of KEWL and panel facili-
tator, said it is important to rec-
ognize the reasons Aprille was
chosen to become W&L’s head
academic ofﬁcer.

“I think it’s important to
have women leaders and also
to know that she wouldn’t have
been chosen if she wasn’t the
best candidate out of the pool of
women and men,” Hughes said.

Dargahi explained why she
felt women on campus should
be celebrated.

“It’s always hardest to be
that ﬁrst person, to take that
ﬁrst step, to get through that
ﬁrst door,” Dargahi said. “By
acknowledging that, it makes it
easier for the second.”

Men's Swimming

The Generals ﬁnished in
eighth place this weekend at
the D-Ill NCAA champion-
ships. That mark ties the
1989 squad for the best ﬁnish
in program history. Senior
Mike Ginder and Junior Alex
Sweet both won First Team
All—America honors for their
performances. Ginder ﬁn-
ished fourth in the 200m free,
while Sweet ﬁnished sixth in
the 100m free. Sweet’s time
of 45.24 broke his own school
record. Ginder and Sweet
joined Tim McGlaston and
Dave Croushore in the 400m
free relay, ﬁnishing sixth with
a time of 3:03.80, also a new

 

school record. Croushore and
McGlaston were also named
First Team All-Americans.
The same four swimmers

also competed in the 200m
free relay, ﬁnishing second
with a time just one-tenth of
a second behind the winning
team from Kenyon. Kenyon
went on to win the team title
as well. Sweet and Ginder
also joined Paul Crook and
Brett Tatman to grab a third
place ﬁnish in the 800m free
relay. That ﬁnish also won
the four swimmers First Team
All-American status. Ginder
was also named an Honorable
Mention All-American for

his ninth place ﬁnish in the
200m backstroke, while Sweet
was honorable mention in the
200m free.

Men's Lacrosse

The men’s lacrosse team
bounced back from a rough
start to its season and notched
two decisive non-conference
victories last week. The team
broke its losing streak on
Monday by thumping Hood
College 24-1. 16 Generals
found the back of the net as
the team raced out to a 12-0
halftime lead and kept up the
pressure until the ﬁnal horn.
On Saturday the men picked
up a big road win, knocking
off Franklin and Marshall
College by a score of 10-3.
The game was played at St.
Paul’s School in Brookland-
ville, Md. Just like they had
against Hood, the men jumped
out to a quick lead, scoring
the ﬁrst six goals and taking
a 7-1 halftime lead. Junior
attacker Ned Rider led the
charge against Hood, scoring
three goals and adding an as-
sist during the ﬁst half. Senior
Grant Martin and freshman
Max Mancuso also added four
points, as six Generals scored

. two goals each. W&L domi-

nated every facet of the game,
taking 80 shots to Hood’s 16.
Goalies Alex Heaton and Matt
Mason for W&L were forced
to make just three saves, while
Hood junior Sam Hoﬁnann
stopped 22 saves during his
60 minutes in the net. Senior
Jim Ryan was the star against
F&M, burying three goals.
Will Englehart and Harry

St. John also added a pair of
goals.

STAFF WRITER

Generals outdoor track and
ﬁeld opened their season strongly
at the Washington and Lee Invi-
tational Saturday. W&L won the
meet with 208 points. The wom-
en took second place with 128
points behind Mary Washington,
who put up 136. The men ﬁn-
ished third behind West Chester
and Westmont.

Overall, the Generals have a
positive outlook for the rest of the
season. “We are a young team
with a lot of freshman and sopho-
mores; we are going to continue
to improve over the course of the
year and for the next couple of
years,” said freshman Billy Bil-
lington.

Individually, both teams had
some strong performers. The
men were led by big performanc-
es from underclassmen. Fresh-
man Joseph Roane ﬁnished ﬁrst
in the triple jump with a 12.06m
performance, while Joel Poelhuis
won the pole vault by clearing ten
and a,half feet. Billington placed
second in the discus with a throw
of 38.53m, and sophomore Brad
Bender took second in the long
jump with a 5.72m leap.

The upperclassmen were not
absent, though. Junior Michael
Keenan placed second in the pole
vault, clearing nine feet and nine
inches. He also ﬁnished third in
the 110 meter hurdles with a time
of 20.82.

Sophomore Ben Wilson placed
third in the shot put with a 12.47m
effort, another strong throwing ef-
fort for the Generals, and senior
Andrew Fischer took third in the
javelin with a 46.03m toss.

The men struggled in the
sprints, grabbing nothing better
than Chip McCoy’s ﬁfth place
ﬁnish in the 400m dash. Marshall
French ﬁnished sixth in the 200m

Men and women combine to

and 400m, while Sean Hurdiss
took sixth in the 100m.

Robbie Varipapa, however,
helped pick things up in the mid-
dle distances with his fourth place
ﬁnish in the l500m.

In the women’s meet, the Gen-
erals put up four ﬁrst place per-
formances. Sophomore Elizabeth
Webb won the 5000 meters for the
Generals in a time of 18:32.21,
while sophomore Becca Taylor
recorded an impressive ﬁrst-place
ﬁnish in the 800 meters with a
time of 2:26.59.

Taylor was followed by team-
mate Dorothy Todd, whose time
of 2:31.76 was good for second
place and gave the Generals a 1-2
ﬁnish.

The 4x100 relay team of fresh-
man Sallie Armstrong, fresh-
man Dalena Moser, sophomore
Stephanie Stelter, and senior Sara
Behmerwohld also won, record-
ing in a time of 54.70.

Sophomore Tara Hildenbrand
and Moser also got on the board
in the 100m dash, ﬁnishing third
and fourth, respectively. '

Alysen Kuck continued the
Generals’ strong showing in jav-
elin, as she won the women’s
competition with a distance of
29.72m.

Additionally, other strong
performances were put in by the
women’s team. Armstrong, one of
the members of the 4x100 relay
team, also took second in the 400
meter hurdles in a time of 70.39.

Freshman Maggie Sutherland
took second place in the 1 10 meter
hurdles in 16.01 and the high jump
with a ﬁve foot effort. Kuck, Ali-
sha Laventure and Jamila Seaton
ﬁnished third through ﬁfth behind
Sutherland, giving the Generals
20 out of a possible 30 points in
the high jump.

The Generals will continue
their season on Friday, March 23
at the Richmond Invitational.

have an effect on them.”

In the doubles competition,
Mary Washington’s team of
Stephanie Kurti and Rebecca
Morse-Karzen won the No. 1
doubles match against Lauren
Caire and Katie Tabb 8-4, but
the Generals took the No. 2 and
No. 3 doubles matches to take a
2-1 lead going into the singles
competition.

W&L’s Emily Applegate:and
Kristen McClung defeated Kate
Miglin and Natalia Fugate 8-
2 in No. 2 doubles, and Ginny
Worthham and Leah Weston de-
feated Mary Washington’s Amy
Sheetz and Priscilla Jamison 8-
2.

In the singles competition the
Generals took ﬁve of six match-
es to secure a 7-2 victory. Tabb,
Wortham, Applegate, Will and
McClung all recorded victories
for the Generals.

The Generals have steam-
rolled their opponents in the
ODAC this season and have yet
to drop a single set in confer-
ence play. The team is looking
to claim its seventeenth ODAC
title. In their two ODAC match-
es this week, the Generals lost
a measly 17 games during 18
matches.

The team will make up Sun-
day’s rained out match at Ran-
dolph-Macon Women’s College
this Thursday before travelling
to Virginia Wesleyan Saturday.

In order to maintain fo-
cus during these matches, the
women ﬁnd speciﬁc goals like
working on new shots or always
winning service games to keep
their focus.

“Our team is extremely deep
and everyone contributes to our
success in ODAC matches,”
said Wortham.

The team is so deep, in fact,
that the Generals played both
Bridgewater and Roanoke on
Tuesday, sending half the team
to Bridgewater while the other
half stayed in Lexington.

This Wednesday the G,ener- ,

als take on Division I opponent
James Madison University.

The Dukes have started the
season 3-3. They lost to Rich-
mond University by a 6-1 score
on Wednesday.

Senior Lauren Graham has
led JMU this spring with a 4-
1 singles record. Graham and
freshman Kelly Maxwell have a
4-3 doubles record.

“JMU will be a great test for
us,” said Wortham. “A few of
us had the opportunity to play
them at Virginia Tech’s Invita-
tional this fall and I think it will
deﬁnitely help us prepare for the
caliber of teams we are going to
face in Texas at Fab Five.”

“JMU will deﬁnitely be a
challenge, but should hopefully
also be a match where we play
loose because there isn’t any-
thing to lose,” said Will. “Beat-
ing them would be great and I
think we can do it.”

The Marlins plated their ﬁrst
run in the third inning by string-
ing together two singles after
Parker hit Hudgins with a pitch.
The Marlins got a second run in
the fourth after Ozz Dhramapi-
taks drove home Brandon Ha-
thaway on a sacriﬁce ﬂy. Ha-
thaway also reached base after
being hit by a pitch.

W&L answered that run in
the bottom of the inning when
Henderson singled home Gar-
land.

The real damage, however,
came in the top of the ﬁfth. The
Marlins strung together four
hits and a walk against Parker
and reliever Chuck Davidson,
eventually pushing three run-
ners across the plate.

Then W&L mounted its last
ditch ninth inning rally.

Davidson went two and two-
third innings, giving up ﬁve hits
and allowing just one run. Ju-
nior Jeff Pharis threw the ﬁnal
two innings.

To stay atop the ODAC
standings the Generals must
rebound quickly. They play at
Bridgewater on Wednesday.

Va-Wes 66 Tie arlins won

the ﬁrst game 6-2
before taking the
second contest 6-5.

The Marlins got to W&L
ace Clayton Edwards in the
ﬁrst game, notching all six runs
in the early going. Edwards

struggled at times in the cold
and blustery conditions, giving
up a two—run home run to Ricky
Allred in the ﬁrst inning before
allowing four runs across the
plate in the third frame. During
that inning Edwards hit.a batter
and then threw a wild pitch that
allowed a runner to score

Matt Hudgins, who leads
the Marlins in average, RBIs
and home runs, went 3-3 with a
home run in the third inning and
a pair of RBIs.

After the tough third inning,
Edwards settled into a groove
for the next three innings, but
his teammates were unable to
mount a comeback.

The Generals got single runs

the ninth with a double to left
and then took third when Ed-

undefeated '

Women beat pair of ODA C foes
and defeat Mary Washington 7-2

By Michael Keenan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team recorded
another undefeated week, tally-
ing two victories against ODAC
opponents Roanoke and Bridge-
water as well as a third vic-
tory against llth-ranked Mary
Washington. Mary Washington

is the second na-

s°°"° tionally ranked
W&L 7 team the Generals

have beaten this
MWU 2

season and the
ﬁrst they’Ve beat-
en away from home.

On Saturday, the women
traveled to F redericksburg, VA,
to take on No. 11 Mary Wash-
ington. The Eagles had just
returned from a very success-
ful 3-0 road trip to California
where they defeated Occidental
9-0, No. 10 Pomona Pitzer 5-4,
and No. 12 Redlands 6-3. The
trip helped boost Mary Wash-
ington’s national ranking from
No. 17 to No. ll and meant they
would be full of conﬁdence for
their home match up against the
No. 3 Generals.

“Mary Washington always
comes out gunning for us and

Saturday was no exception,”
said senior Ginny Wortham.
“They just came off of a very
successful trip to California and
so our win today was really im-

portant for ranking reasons ancﬂ

because it is nice to play well
against a conﬁdent team.”

The match was played inside
Mary Washington’s University
Tennis Center where loud fans
had gathered to support the Ea-
gles.

“We played indoors and
the Mary Washington players
and fans really got behind and
cheered loudly for their team,
said Wortham. “I think its re-
ally'hard but important to try to
block out the environment and
just focus on your court.”

The mental toughness of the
Generals was put to the test,
but the women rose to the chal-
lenge.

“The crowd at Mary Wash
is always loud and constantly
cheering so the element of focus
is really important,” said junior
Kelly Will. “However, many of
us have dealt with it before so it
doesn’t have as strong of an ef-
fect as it could and the freshmen
