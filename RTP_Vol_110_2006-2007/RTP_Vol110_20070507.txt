It has been over a year since 16-year-old Lexington resident Charles Volpe drowned underneath the darn at Jordan’s Point after heing swept over the edge by a strong cur-
rent. Now Dylan Fitzgerald, one of Volpe’s friends, is planning a permanent memorial to honor Volpe and other peple who have drowned at Jordan’s Point over the years.

Local teen plans memorial for friend

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

A year after local teenager Charles
Volpe drowned at the Jordan’s Point dam,
one of his friends is planning a permanent
memorial.

“I was good friends with Charles.
 I’d see him at the skate park” Dylan
Fitzgerald said. “After Charles died, Mr.
Volpe said he didn’t want him to be for-
gotten.”

Fitzgerald and Volpe became friends
because their mothers were friends.

As a memorial to Volpe, Fitzgerald
wants to plant several river trees and two
large beds of wildﬂowers. He also wants
to move a park bench honoring Volpe up
to the overlook of the darn that the city is
ﬁnishing up.

Volpe was 16 years old when he went
swimming in the Maury River on the af-
temoon of Sunday, April 23, 2006. Volpe
and his friend Bryc Talley were both swept
over the dam. Talley was able to escape
the undercurrent, but Volpe could not.

Rain storms earlier that week made the
normally placid current swift and deep.
Volpe drowned within an hour of the riv-
er’s peak discharge that day.

Volpe was the fourth person since 2003
to drown in the Maury River near the park
at Jordan’s Point.

A member of Lexington’s Boy Scout
Troop 5, Fitzgerald is also using the proj-
ect to fulﬁll one of the ﬁnal requirements
for Eagle Scout, the highest rank attain-
able in Scouting.

Fitzgerald has been working closely
on the memorial plans with Charles Vol-
pe, Sr. and Bill Blatter, the Lexington City
Planner. Blatter has been incorporating

those plans into an ongoing renovation of
the Jordan’s Point Park. If the overhaul
is completed as planned, the park will
get permanent restrooms, an informa-
tion kiosk and new paving for the park-
ing lot. The city also hopes to reconnect
the Woods Creek Trail with the Chessie
Trail.

“If we were done with everything in
two years, I’d feel great,” Blatter said.
“We’ll see if we have enough money to
get everything done.”

Blatter said that most of the construc-
tion is being completed with grant mon-

‘G
about people being on the darn.”

In years past, people would jump off
the darn into the water below, often diving
or trying to do ﬂips off the dam. The dam
is owned by the city, and city law prohib-
its anyone from being on the dam. Any-
one seen on the dam would be charged
with trespassing and ﬁned.

Crowder said his officers drive through
the park regularly, both to check on swim-
mers and to watch for underage drinking
in the park. When Volpe drowned last
year, Crowder was in charge of coordinat-
ing the emergency response effort. It took

“I was good friends with Charles... I ’a’ see him at
the skate park. After Charles died, Mr Volpe said he

didn ’t want him to be forgotten. ’

ey the city has received. Upkeep of the
park and Fitzgerald’s proposed memorial
would be handled by the city.

Lexington Police Chief Steve Crowder
said Blatter has worked hard to serve as a
liaison between city and Volpe’s family.

Fitzgerald said local teens still swim at
Jordan’s Point, but he said they are more
careful in the water.

“People are more aware of [the dan-
ger],” he said.

Crowder said his department has no-
ticed safer behavior down at J ordan’s
Point.

“To my knowledge, since this hap-
pened we have not had any complaints

a team of divers and search dogs nearly 24
hours to recover Volpe’s body.

While Fitzgerald plans his permanent
memorial, the city is left to ponder the
dam’s long term future. Both Fitzgerald
and Volpe Sr. told a city council meeting
last June that they thought the dam should
be destroyed. ‘

Volpe did not return several calls to his
office.

Blatter said the city will continue to
consider the dam’s future during the next
year.

planner said. “We acknowledge the need
to be careful down there.”

Blatter said the city would need to
consider the impact, difficulty and cost
of any proposals to dismantle the dam.
He also said the city would encourage a
“community dialogue” before taking any
action.

In an interview last year, City Man-
ager Jon Ellestad said the dam no longer
serves any purpose. He said that dams
like the one at Jordan’s Point were put in
the river to help barges travel upstream.

There are hundreds of low head dams
across the country, and many of them no
longer serve any purpose. Though the
small dams do not look dangerous, their
design can create a deadly undertow that
can trap a person under the dam.

After Volpe’s deathb the city installed
a series of buoys above the dam. The
buoys were attached to shore by a cable
that was designed to separate if the wa-
ter level rose too high after a heavy rain-
storm upstream.

But during a recent ﬂood, the cable
failed to work as designed, and the city

had to remove the wrecked buoys. Blat-
ter said the city is trying to ﬁnd other
ways to reinstall the warning system.

There are also several signs warning
people to use caution when swimming
near the dam. Many swimmers now go
into the river further upstream from the
dam instead of right above it.

Crowder said he hopes people have
learned from the tragedy.

“It’s a shame bad things have to hap-
pen before things like this are recog-
nized,” he said. “Even though it’s a trag-
edy, we have to learn from it.”

Faculty reevaluate W&L’s core

Incoming Class of 201 1 must satisfy new FDR requirements

By Grace Wang
STAFF WRITER

The 2007-2008 academic year will
mark Washington and Lee’s introduction
to the new Foundation and Distribution
Requirements (FDRs). Applicable only
to the Undergraduate Class of 2011 and
beyond, the FDRs will replace the Gener-
al Education Requirements, which were
established in 1984.

Scott Dittman, the University Regis-
trar, said the change from GEs to FDRs
resulted from a need to review and revisit
the common, thought-provoking experi-
ence shared by all W&L students. The
primary goals were to reduce the overall
proportion of core requirements to total
number of credits needed to graduate as
well as encourage student exploration.

Dittman stated that this change was
not imposed by the administration, but
rather led by the faculty.

He explained that the faculty deliber-
ated over the changes through a number
of different committees, including a GE
Review Steering Committee, co-chaired
by Michael Evans and Robert Strong,
two faculty members, and a GE Commit-
tee, headed by Provost H. Thomas Wil-
liams. The proposed changes were then
voted on by the entire faculty, with a ma-
jority of 51% in favor needed.

In addition, these faculty committees
discussed ideas for new developments
in the curriculum, including freshman
seminars and the Spring Option. Both of
these developments are currently being
exercised.

The idea for freshman seminars came
through Dean Hank Dobin. As Associ-
ate Dean at Princeton University, Dean
Dobin led the freshman seminar pro-

gram.

The Spring Option recognizes that
W&L students of all undergraduate years
may want to start their summers early to
volunteer, work, study for major exami-
nations, or travel. Should students opt
for the Spring Option, they will not have
to enroll in spring term classes and are
still considered full-time students.

In addition, the Spring Option beneﬁts
faculty members by decreasing teaching
load during the academic year through
the reduction of students studying on
campus during the Spring Term.

Other ideas raised during the faculty
committee meetings, such as the “I” (In-
terdisciplinary, Internships, Interactive)
and Cultural attendance requirements,
were supported by some of the faculty,
discussed extensively, but not included in
the ﬁnal proposal.

The “I” requirement would have re-
quired students to take one or several
classes in the interdisciplinary studies,
such as Women’s Studies, African Amer-
ican Studies, or the Poverty and Human
Capability Studies as well as engage in
internships.

The Cultural Requirement aimed to
increase W&L students’ cultural aware-
ness and would have required students
to attend a number of concerts, lectures,
and other similar events throughout the
academic year.

Domnica Radulescu, Professor of
Romance Languages, was a particularly
strong proponent of the “I” requirement.

The new FDRs are comprised of both
Foundation requirements, measured by
proﬁciency in writing, foreign language,
mathematics or computer science, and
physical education, and Distribution re-
quirements, which explore more deeply

various academic disciplines.

The requirements for the writing,
foreign language, and mathematics and
computer science sections have stayed
the same while the number of required
Physical Education skills courses has
dropped from ﬁve to four. Swimming
proﬁciency is still required.

The Distribution Requirements con-
sist of those in arts and humanities and
those in sciences and social sciences.

and Religion, and other similar courses.
Now, only three credits (one class) from
among history, philosophy, religion, and
a couple other class options from other
departments are required.

Dr. Richard Bidlack of the History
Department does not believe this de-
crease in required humanities credits
will be beneﬁcial to students. He said,
“To better understand the origins of the
most vexing and explosive problems in

“In the new curriculum, the total number of cred-

its needed to graduate will decrease by six 0’rom
121 to 115); however: the number of credits in
FDRS (formerly, general education requirements),
which account for fewer than half of the total

credits, drops by twelve. ”

RICHARD BIDLACK, Associate Professor of History

Literature has now been categorized
as a section of the arts and humanities
Distribution Requirement, and only one
such course is required, instead of the
two required under the former Genera-
tion Education Requirements.

In addition, all incoming freshmen are
now required to take at least one class in
the ﬁne arts and can choose from clas-
sics, art, theater, and music.

In addition, under the GE system, stu-
dents were required to take twelve cred-
its from Fine Arts, History, Philosophy,

our world, I feel that our students should
be encouraged to devote more time, not
less, to the study of history, philosophy,
and religion, especially of those people
whom we poorly understand.”

The requirements for science and
mathematics have not changed. Math-
ematics/computer science proﬁciency, a
four-credit laboratory science, and an ad-
ditional mathematics and science course
chosen from select biology, chemistry,
computer science, engineering, geology,
mathematics, and physics classes are still

required.

Conversely, the requirement for social
sciences has dropped from nine credits,
or three courses, to two courses. Incom-
ing freshmen now pick two classes from
a selection of ﬁve areas including eco-
nomics, politics, psychology, anthropol-
ogy, and environmental science/joumal-
ism to satisfy this requirement.

Bidlack believes that the decrease in
F DRs from GEs is disproportionately
large to the decrease in total credits re-
quired to graduate. He said, “In the new
curriculum, the total number of credits
needed to graduate will decrease by six
(from 121 to 115); however, the number
of credits in F DRs (formerly, general ed-
ucation requirements), which account for
fewer than half of the total credits, drops
by twelve.

“As I understand it, FDRs were re-
duced by a disproportionately large num-
ber, in part because that is what our peer
institutions are doing. Also, the faculty
seemed to want to give students more
choice in selecting the subjects they
study,” he said.

Dalena Moser, a freshman from
Rochester, MN, believes the new FDR
requirements are a positive improvement
to the curriculum.

She said, “Now, most of our freshman
and sophomore years are spent trying to
ﬁll GEs and then junior and senior years
are spent working on our major. It is hard
to ﬁnd time to take classes that you are
interested in if they don’t ﬁt into one of
those categories.”

She added, “I know the beneﬁts of
a liberal arts college are experiencing
many different academic areas, but I feel
that the FDRs still require enough variety
without being overbearing.”

Lexingtorfs dam problem

lt’s business as usual these days on
the Maury River.

One year after we reported on the
death of local teenager Charles Volpe,
the city has still not done enough to
improve safety at the Jordan’s Point
dam. .

The Lexington Police Department
patrols down there more often these
days, but those officers can’t provide
constant surveillance. The city set up
a line of red buoys above the darn, but
they washed away after a heavy rain-
storm.

So the only real safety measures
in place are some new warning signs
and one ﬂoating buoy right above the

dam.

That’s not enough.

Of course, people who swim and
canoe at .Iordan’s Point need to take
some responsibility for their own safe-
ty. And it looks like people—for the
most part—Aarc doing that. Swimmers
are staying away from the dam and
swimming further upstream.

On a normal day, the likelihood
of someone being accidentally swept
over the dam is low. But as long as the
dam remains in place, there’s another
accident waiting to happen.

Charles Volpe was an expert swim-
mer and certiﬁed scuba diver, but that
was not able to save him when he went

over the dam last April.

City Planner Bill Blatter said the
city will soon begin considering the
dams long—term future. That discus-
sion needs to begin now.

While the city scrambles around,
trying to lure in the Museum of the
Confederacy, the dam sits at .lordan’s
Point, just as dangerous as it was last
spring.

The discussion on the dam’s future
really began last June, when Volpe’s
father delivered an impassioned plea
to the City Council, begging them to
remove the dam.

City Manager Jon Ellestad admit-
ted last year that the darn has no real

purpose.
Removing the dam would be ex-

pensive and difficult, but the city needs
to move ahead and take action.

The dangers of low head dams are
well-documented nationally. They’re
known as drowning machines.

It would be foolish to consider Vol-
pe’s death an unfortunate but isolated
incident. Less than two months after
Volpe drowned, a‘ canoe ,was swept
over the dam. Thankfully, nobody
was injured.

It’s time for the city to get seri-
ous about dealing with the dam. The
dam’s future must be decided before
another tragedy occurs.

Philly teachers berate, bore children

Alternative Spring Break at successful urban schools shockingly disappoints

By Jess Steinmetz
c 0 L U M N IS T

I gi‘c':. up in a small town of 400
people in Northern California where
we have a bar, two fire stations and a
post ofﬁv.‘c. Since there are essentially
riojcb,  the area, the majority ofthe
residents are retired.

The only hope of having kids my
age in the neighborhood was if they
were visiting their grandparents for
the weekend. My town, for obvious
reasons, did not have its own school so
I was districted to attend the schools in
our neighboring town.

These schools feature an almost
sure chance of getting lice year after
year‘ and taking overcrowded classes
in the cafeteria.

My parents were not exactly pleased
with the less than stellar‘ record these
schools offered in terms of future high
school graduation and college gradu-
ation rates. They thus decided to send
me to private school.

My Catholic school was the bane
of my existence from kindergarten
through eighth grade. I quickly grew
sick of the uniforms, half a dozen
prayers throughout the day, mean
teachers, stuck-up students, and reli-
gion classes every day. I never could
quite understand why my second grade

teacher focused more on religion than
Englislr, history and nrath combined.

Despite my hatred of my school,
I always knew I had it much better
off than the public school nearest my
house.

My recent trip to"Philadelphia cori-
ﬁrrned how lucky I was to attend a
school where nearly all students would
graduate high school and many would
go to college.

I went on the Alternative Spring
Break trip to Philadelphia with 13
other Washington‘and Lee students.
Our focus was urban education, and
we went to three different schools over
the week.

We were told that the first school
we were to visit was very successful
and I had high expectations of what
this school was like for students. In-
stead, I was sorely disappointed, par-
ticularly in ternrs of the curriculum
and teachers.

on guns and gangs. I personally had a
hard time blaming them for not paying
attention, considering her lesson plans
were so boring I could have easily
fallen asleep.

llow can one expect students to be
engaged in their classes when their
teachers do not seem remotely inter-
ested in teaching their students?

The second grade teacher spent 75
percent of the day yelling and insult-
ing her students. She told me in the
front of the class that many of them
did not deserve to learn and should not
be helped.

What made the situation even
worse was that her students were not
'eing unruly. They were just being
typical second graders who began to
ﬁdget after being in the same seat for
hours on end.

Quality teachers are essential to
receiving an excellent education. In
my opinion, the teachers I observed

did not motivate their students or help
them excel in the classroom. Unfortu-
nately, this school failed to show me
that it is doing what is truly best for
its students.

L If this is what a “good” school in
Philadelphia looks like, what do the
“bad” schools look like?

While the people who went on the
trip with me were amazing and great to
hang out with, I cannot help but think
these were not the people who would
most beneﬁt from the trip. I feel it is
fair to say that we all agreed that the
education system in Philadelphia and
numerous other cities across America
desperately needs to improve.

At W&L, many people have been
fortunate enough to come from excel-
lent schools. Even though we are sur-
rounded by students who have come
from such schools, it’ is important to
take a step back and realize that this is
not the reality for others.

I sat in on the classrooms
of four different teachers
at this one school, none of
whom even slightly im-
pressed me.

The science teacher, for ’
instance, did not even try
to focus ‘the attention of her
students and just ignored
their constant discussions

Unspeakable

joy of death
and dying

Including why we stop to

look at accidents, futile
attempts to be God, and
the erotic joy of taboos

By Daniel Mesonero Kromand
c o I. u M N l s T

*Disclaimer: The viewpoints in
this article are only those of the

author and the rest of Europe*

Last week I tried to add to the irony by
naming the article “you’re so prententious,”
but for journalistic reasons ‘my editors
changed it. This suits me ﬁne, as it means
I can focus on my rants and they’ll take
care of making it make sense. Well, back to
some serious critical theory.

Have you ever stopped to look at a par-
ticularly bloody accident and then won-
dered how come you are so sick? I don’t
have the answer to that, but luckily Georges
Bataille does.

First, though, we need to take a step
back. The premises for human existence are
that we come from continuous void (before
birth), live our lives as discontinuous be-
ings, and then return to the continuous void
(whether you call this heaven or not is, for
our existence, irrelevant).

When applying the term discontinuous
being, Bataille stresses the fact that no mat-
ter how much we reproduce, we—the be-
ing—will at some point cease to exist.

This rather unsettling thought causes”

Man to attempt a climb to the top of the
hierarchy, the top of the pyramid, which is
held by God (or whatever arbitrary word is
tied to his name).

Soon after, though, Man realizes that this
is a futile climb. So instead of attempting to
become continuous beings, we choose to
catch tiny glimpses of that inﬁnite.

These ﬂashes come in different pack-
ages according to the culture to which the
individual belongs. ~

Religious people seek in it in devotion,
inspirations, and divine ecstasies, the A2-
tecs sought it in human sacriﬁce, and most
modern people seek it in eroticism and oc-
casional drug use.

Bataille doesn’t equal all of these ecsta-
sies and actually claims that religious in-
spiration is more powerful and meaningful.
Yet they all are the result of the same search
of a glimpse of the inﬁnite, which is beyond
us in everyday life.

So to return to the situation where you
stop to observe the horror of an accident,
this is a situation with a high resemblance
to the sacriﬁces of the Aztecs.

Without bringing your own being in

danger of death, you are able to see another
individual who might be experiencing it and
thereby convey some information about the
inﬁnite. » '
Bataille also closely examines the ta-
boo, more speciﬁcally the joys we get from
transgressing taboos. Especially in eroti-
cism this plays an enormous role.

By transgression he means the voluntary
venture into forbidden territory but even
when the rules are broken they still stand,
for the participants are aware of the breach
and will soon return to the accepted behav-
ior while keeping the joy secret.

This fact may explain why we feel so
bad about enjoying other people’s misfor-
tune.

During the observance of the accident
everybody is captivated by the thrill of
death, but immediately afterwards we all
join in to lament the loss and thereby once
again reinforce the rules of acceptable con-
duct. The shame comes from the transgres-
sion of a taboo.

In today’s world where we’re all rela-
tively safe (except the unfortunate few who
die in trafﬁc or become victims of some
crime), we still feel as though doom is just
about to descend on us. Whether it’s in the
form of bird ﬂu, Ebola, SARS, terrorism,
or tsunamis, the world always seem to be
teetering on the edge of the abyss.

I subscribe this to a hidden desire, not to
actually see it happen, but rather to imagine
it happen. In our safety, which is unprec-
edented in the history of Man, we still have
the need for the occasional glimpse into the
continuum. Think about it.

Remembering the terrible tragedy

Survivor urges campus to prevent new Holocausts from occuring

By Jess Ramos

Many people constantly forget things
in the Elrod Commons, like backpacks,
wallets, or books. However, the Com-
mons became a place last week to re—
member the Holocaust through many
forms, from ﬁlms to a survivor’s story.

Last week, Washington and Lee’s
Hillel chapter hosted the third annual
Holocaust Remembrance Week. Hillel
is a global organization that opportuni-
ties for Jewish students to celebrate and
preserve their Jewish identity.

On campus, Hillel has coordinated
other events, such as a Seder to cel-
ebrate Passover and monthly Shabbat
services. ,

As Hillel’s membership grows on
campus, the university has been work-
ing on plans to construct a Hillel House,
possibly near the comer of Washington
and Jelferson. '

According to freshman Stephanie
Dultz, Secretary of Hillel, the Holo-

Alums take Lex, W&L by storm

caust Remembrance Week was an event
to “reaffirm this horrible event. . .[and]

Among the highlights of this year’s
Holocaust Remembrance Week were
screenings of two acclaimed ﬁlms, “The
Last Days” and “The Pianist.” Shown
in the Commons Theater throughout
the week, these two ﬁlms represented
the Holocaust in memory.

On Wednesday, members of the
Washington and Lee community signed
a memorial scroll in the Commons for
Holocaust victims. In addition, par-
ticipants received a photograph of their
person and a memorial paper clip.

Dultz said the idea for paper clips
came from a documentary about a mid-
dle school class that conceptualized 6
million by collecting 6 million paper
clips.

An estimated six million Jews were
killed by the Nazis during the Holo-
caust.

Instead of only keeping paper to-
gether, the paper clips united the par-

“Hitler set me up for hope I should never have.  Goa’

sparea’ me so I can share my painful past. ”

IRENE ZISBLATT, Holocaust survivor

ticipants in solidarity this week.

Irene Zisblatt, a Holocaust survi-
vor, told on Thursday night “a story
we didn’t plan on telling.” Her coura-
geous story of survival is also featured
in one of the screened ﬁlms, “The Last
Days.”

In the concentration camps, Zisb-
latt saved her mother’s diamonds by
eating and retrieving them in her own
excretion. Despite the death and hate-
surrounding her, Zisblatt remained op-
timistic. “Hitler set me up for hope I
should never have,” said Zisblatt.

Eventually, American soldiers res-
cued Zisblatt and she soon moved to
America. Fifty years later, Zisblatt
shared her story and returned to the
camps on a divine mandate. “God

spared me so I can share my painful
past,” she said.

Zisblatt emphasized remembering
and learning from the Holocaust. “I
will not be silent or refuse to forget the
victims,” she said.

Because the current generation will
be the last to know Holocaust survivors
ﬁrsthand, Zisblatt implored the audi-
ence to remember the Holocaust. In
doing so, Zisblatt said, “you will not let
it happen again.”

Hillel collaborated with Washing-
ton and Lee’s Multifaith Council to
organize a Vigil against Oppression on
Tuesday. Led by the Director of Reli-
gious Life, Burr Datz, the vigil featured
poetry, readings, music, and moments
of silence.

The vigil was an opportunity to take
stand for “all those oppressed—all the
genocides in the world,” said Dultz.
“[There is a] holocaust still going on.”

Holocaust Remembrance Week
wrapped up with a Yom Ha Shoah ser-
vice led by Rabbi Treseder of Lynch-
burg.

Overall, Holocaust Remembrance
Week was successful. Though she
would have liked more attendance at
events, “we’ve made progress, deﬁ-
nitely,” said Dultz.

Dultz echoed Zisblatt’s emphasis on
remembering the Holocaust to prevent
a similar event from ever happening
again.

Like Zisblatt, Dultz emphasized
the current generation’s critical posi-
tion in remembering the Holocaust.
“Holocaust survivors are not going to
be around for much longer...its time
for the new generation to learn all we
can about it...[to] teach future genera-
tions.”

Graduates from 11 different classes braved
chancy weather to meet up with old friends
and be honored at Wahsington and Lee’s an-
nual alumni weekend.

Cars ﬂooded the streets of Lexington as
alums poured onto campus during the rain on
Friday. The somewhat dismal weather didn’t
stop visitors and students from donning sun-
dresses and plaid shorts, however, both on the
hill and at various Greek events.

Cars were packed into downtown, at times
turning Washington Street and the surrounding
blocks into a virtual parking lot.

Chief Steve Crowder of the Lexington Po-
lice Department said the biggest challenge his
officers had to deal with was the parking short-
age.

The university went all out for the occasion,
planning numerous receptions and parties.
Douglas W. Bostick, author of Memorializing
Robert E. Lee: The Story of Lee Chapel, gave
the keynote address at the Opening Assembly

and also signed books at the University Store
after his speech.

Recreational activities from golf to clay
shooting competitions were provided for alums
who wished to participate. Most academic de-
partments also offered open house sessions,
and the Language Department even sponsored
20-minute language classes.

Alums at the journalism open house seemed
as excited to see Melissa Cox, the department
secretary, as they were to see each other.

A barbecue bash was held at Zollman’s
Pavillion on Friday. Following the cookout,
transportation from campus was provided to
Zollman’s for Alumni Late Night, an event
that lasted until 1 am. On Saturday, the W&L
a capella groups General Admission, Jubilee
and Southern Comfort also held a showcase.
The weekend was capped off with the Harlem
Renaissance Ball at the Sheridan Livery on
Saturday evening.

Of course, the affects of alumni weekend
are felt most by W&L students in the realm
of Greek Life. Sororities held receptions for
alumni during the day on Saturday. Fraternities

across campus celebrated with cocktail parties,
barbecues, and bands such as Snackbar Jones.

Alumni turnout at the events varied, but
most alumni seemed energetic and happy
to be mixing with students. Visitor numbers
dwindled as the night wore on, but a few token
stragglers partied well into the night, even hit-
ting up events like Chi Psi’s Late Night.

‘ Student reactions to alumni weekend dif-
fered as well. “It’s one of the better weekends
we have during spring term,” says sophomore
David Stancyk.

Most undergrads attending parties on Fri-
day and Saturday night seemed to agree that
alumni weekend was fun although perhaps one
of the stranger weekends at W&L.

Not everyone was as enthusiastic, how-
ever. Undergrad junior Robert Walker said the
weekend would be more fun without the pres-
ence of alums.

Despite the few dissenters, both visitors and
students seemed to enjoy themselves through-
out the weekend. If nothing else, the event
gives frats yet another excuse to start partying
early during spring term.

Jan Hathorn gives the women’s lacrosse team helpful advice during halftime of
the ODAC Championship game against Roanoke (right). Hathorn and the Generals
celebrate their fifth consecutive ODAC Championship and the recognition of five
teammates as members of the All-ODAC Tournament team (above).

By Mike Huntress
STAFF WRITER

In Spring 1986, one-fourth
of the roughly 100 women who
constituted Washington and Lee’s
ﬁrst coeducational class would
gather and participate in women ’s
club soccer.

With 25 women gathering to
escape W&L’s overwhelmingly
male student body that hadn’t
lived side by side with women for
more than 200 years, the roots of
one of W& L’s ﬁrst women’s ath-
letic programs were laid. It was
far removed from the atmosphere
of competition and excellence
that now envelops W&L’s wom-
en’s athletics.

Jan Hathom would eventually
take that soccer program and also
the women’s lacrosse to such an
elevated position. In recognition
of not only her personal but also
all women’s success in athletics
since coeducation, W&L named
Hathom the university’s seventh
athletic director on April 24”‘.

Last week Hathom’s lacrosse
team beat Roanoke to capture a
ﬁlth straight ODAC conference ti-
tle as it ﬁnished the season ranked
20th in all ofDivision III. Success
on that level has become the norm
for Hathom’s program, which she
has been coaching since its incep-
tion in 1989.

That Hathom and her teams
would succeed and contribute to
the university as they have seems
natural to us now, but coeducation
occurred in the face of staunch
opposition.

Jonathan Westervelt Warner
(for whom the athletic center is
named) stepped down from his
position on the board of trustees
in 1984 as a result of his opposi-
tion to the decision to fully inte-
grate women into the undergradu-
ate program.

“I knew the process would
take time and there would be a
level of patience required,” said
Hathom about forging a women’s

. athletic program despite some

disapproval, “although I never
felt we didn’t get the recognition
we deserved.”

Hathom’s announcement as
athletic director isn’t the result’
of a new recognition of women’s
importance at W&L, but it is
symbolic of it. At a school where
almost every plaque or monument
of past glory is devoid’ of any
feminine inﬂuence, for the head
of the athletic department to be a
woman is a signiﬁcant event.

“I think it is symbolic of
[women’s importance in athlet-
ics],” said Hathom. “Now people
pay attention to every step of the
way. Whether it’s good or bad
we’re just like the men.”.

Hathom’s successes are nu-
merous and extensive. Follow-
ing her graduation from the State
University of New York at Cort-
land in 1982 where she played
lacrosse and basketball, she spent
ﬁve years at Denison University,
winning a conference title each
year.

Hathom was named the North
Coast Athletic Conference Wom-
en’s Lacrosse Coach of the Year
in 1987. She then came to W&L,
where she began coaching wom-
en’s soccer in 1987 and lacrosse
in I989. With the soccer team
she posted two ODAC champi-
onships and was twice named
the ODAC’s Coach of the Year
before stepping down in 2000 to
focus on lacrosse.

Her lacrosse teams have won
nine ODAC championships,
made eight NCAA appearances,
accumulated 274 victories—ﬁfth
highest all time for women’s la-
crosse coaches~—and Hathom has
won eight ODAC Coach of the
Year awards at the helm of the la-
crosse team.

With so many athletic deco-
rations it’s easy to see why Ha-
thom was considered among the
90 candidates who were applied
for the Athletic Director position;
however, those accolades don’t
quantify her most admirable attri-
bute as seen by her peers.

W&L’s men’s soccer coach
Rolf Piranian has the unique per-
spective of being a member of the
faculty both before and after co-
education. He coached the wom-
en’s club soccer team in 1985
and 1986 before Hathom turned
it into a varsity sport. In addi-'
tion, he graduated from W&L in
1974. Piranian thinks highly of
Hathom.

“She’s got a great sense of
Division III sports” he said. “It’s
not an end all; it’s a chance to
challenge kids. It’s not an end in
itself.”

Alongside coaches such as
Cinda Rankin, who similarly
developed W&L’s ﬁrst varsity
women’s tennis team, Hathom is
part of the vanguard of women
who helped change the culture of
women’s athletics at W&L.

“Twenty-ﬁve years ago wom-
en and their place in athletics was
relatively small in number and
not particularly celebrated,” said
Hathom. “Some of it was an eq-
uity issue and some is a cultural
acceptance level. Now it is cele-
brated to be an athlete and a good
athlete.”

The prevailing sense seems
to be that originally women were
just allowed to come and be part
W&L’s androcentric history. Now
they are regarded as the school’s
other vital half.

Piranian summed this up when
he said of women’s athletics over
the years, “Now it’s a different
mindset. Now it is win the ODAC
and go to nationals. Then it was
just giving them something to do.
It was about participation.”

In 2002 Warner donated $1
million in what was a very ex-
pensive acknowledgement of a
mistake. That donation is allotted
to go largely to women’s scholar-
ships as a result of his recognition
of how women strengthened the
university instead of weakening
it.

Credit women like Hathom,
the new athletic director, for mak-
ing that mistake abundantly clear.

Concluding
a career of
excellence

Jan Hathorn is the only coach that W&L is women is
lacrosse team has ever known, but this weeks NCAA
tournament will mark her ﬁnal games on the sideline as she

leaves the coaching realm and prepares to become the new

Team ﬁghts hard but
comes up short in ODAC
tournament vs. Roanoke

By Brian Devlne
smrr wnmzn

The Old Dominion Athletic
Conference is traditionally a
stable of national contenders in
men’s lacrosse. The conference
tournament this week featured
four nationally ranked teams,
so it is no shame that the men
from Washington and Lee fell
by one goal in the semiﬁnals to
Roanoke College.

Entering the tournament
ranked No. 18 nationally, a spot
that might have given the Gen-
erals a top seed if they played in
a dozen other conferences, they
were handed the number four
seed and a Wednesday evening
contest against the Roanoke
Maroons, top-seeded and ranked
No. 11 in the country.

The game at RC’s Alumni
Field was a back-and-forth af-
fair, and no team led by more
than three goals from beginning
to end. Roanoke went up 3-1
early, but W&L rallied to level
at 4-4 midway through the sec-
ond period.

Three minutes later, the home
side was again up by three. This
pattern continued throughout
the contest as neither squad was
able to gain a decisive advan-
tage. The visiting Generals went
up 12-9 in the fourth quarter. the
ﬁrst time all evening that W&L
had led by more than one.

..play, however, the Maroons

showed that they deserved their
12-4 season record. Three unan-
swered goals in two minutes tied
the score at 12, where it would
remain into the dying moments.

Just as overtime seemed as-
sured, the Maro_ons went up a
man on a W&L penalty. Roa-
noke had been up a man four
times previously in the game
but had been denied goals each
time by goalkeeper Chris Lalli,
who recorded 10 saves. With
only 25 seconds remaining, RC
broke their luckless streak as

 

 

midﬁelder Chaz Carlson fed his
teammate Steve Furdock, who
beat Lalli for the winner.

Despite falling 13-12, the
Generals acquitted themselves
well in front of the Roanoke
fans. The Maroon, rightfully
considered the best team in
the ODAC, went on to win
Sunday’s championship game
against third-seeded and nation-
ally-ranked Lynchburg College.
Roanoke will represent the con-
ference in the NCAA touma-
merit.

The one goal difference
proved that W&L had the skill
to play with the conferences
top teams. Some doubted the
side’s ability to compete with
the likes of Roanoke, Lynchburg
and Hampden—Sydney after the
Generals lost 12-3 to Lynchburg
on Saturday April 28.

Lalli and his teammates
wanted to prove that that re-
sult was an aberration, not the
standard of play for the. team.
Leading the way for W&L was
sophomore midﬁelder Harry St.
John, who scored ﬁve goals on

of which were part of the Gen-
erals’ four-goal run in the fourth
quarter to go ahead 12-“).

enough to counter Roanoke‘s
triple-edged sword of Carlson,
Zach Thomas and Jon Mason,
who have combined for 123
goals and 86 assists this season
as of the ODAC championship
game.

The Generals’ defense held
Thomas and Mason to three

. goals each, but it was Carlson’s

game-winning assist with 25
seconds left that undid all of
the Generals’ solid, competitive

play.

Men is team

Second round

By Michael Keenan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
men’s tennis team came up short
in its bid to advance to the third
round of the NCAA team cham-
pionships on Saturday against
Johns Hopkins University. Com-
ing off their impressive victory in

the ODAC tournament, the men’s_

tennis team boasted a 20-2 record,
was ranked No. 20 nationally and
looked to advance deep into the
national tournament after receiv-
ing a ﬁrst-round bye.

Johns Hopkins, despite be-
ing ranked No. 13 in the country
and boasting a 17-2 record, was
forced to play a first round match
against 15-2 Messiah College.
Messiah proved to be no match
for the Blue Jays, and Hopkins
won easily, 5-0, and advanced to
the second round to play W&L.

The Blue Jays jumped out to
strong start by taking all three
doubles matches. Hopkin’s num-
ber one doubles team of Hillen
Smith, Jr. and Joe Vasoontara de-
feated W&L’s duo of juniors Tim
Ross and Stuart Sanford 8-3.

Senior Jon Malooly and soph-
omore Jamie McCardell fell to
Hopkins’ David Maldow and Dan
Myers by the same score in num-
ber two doubles. Freshmen Alex
Brooke and junior Seth Feibel-
man made a closer match, but ul-
timately fell to Matt Naftilan and
Rafael Roberti, 8-6, in number
three doubles.

In singles, Sanford recorded
the Generals’ lone victory by de-
feating Myers 6-0, 6-4, in number
four singles. However, in number
two singles Malooly lost to Va-
soontara 6-4, 6-2, and in num-
ber ﬁve singles McCardell lost
to Roberti 6-3, 6-4, to end the
match.

When the match ended, Fie-
belman had won the first set and
led 5-1 in the second over JHU’s
Larry Wei in number three sin-
gles.

Junior Nelson Bunn was up
a set on JHU’s Peter Vale but
trailed 5-6 in the second set in
number six singles. After losing
a close ﬁrst set 7-5, junior Tim
Ross trailed 5-0 in the second set
to JHU’s David Maldow in num-
ber one doubles.

Even though the season came
to an unhappy end, the Generals
have much to build on for next
season. Looking ahead, the only
senior competing for the Generals
in the national tournament was Jon
Malooly. In addition to winning
the ODAC tournament, W&L had
six individuals and one doubles
team honored as ﬁrst-team all-
ODAC as well as ODAC Coach
of the Year David Detwiler.

The Generals’ twenty wins this
season was the highest win total
ever, besting the previous record
set by the 1975 team which went
18-6.

plechase on Thursday in a time of 12:02.92,
which is a record for W&L. '

“Winning felt great, but what I am es-
pecially proud of is being the ﬁrst female
athlete at W&L to compete in the steeple-
chase,” Taylor said.

She also said, “the steeple is a really
tough race, both physically and mentally.
If you don’t keep steady concentration and
attack each barrier, you could end up with
your face planted into the track. But at the
same time it is an extremely exciting and
ﬁin race. I feel a great sense of accomplish-
ment when I ﬁnish, knowing that I just ran
3000 meters and over 35 barriers.”

Taylor says she owes her success to her
coaches Kris and Nate Hoey. Hoey actually
ran this event in the Olympic time trials,

Con’i w iii for the full report.

and though she could not be there, was on
the phone with Nate Hoey to hear the play-
by-play.

“Yesterday was my last track meet for
the season, but I am hoping to come back
next year even stronger,” Taylor said.
“There is even talk of making the steeple
an ODAC event. And I am crossing my ﬁn-
gers that when our new stadium is built, it
includes steeple barriers and a water jump
pit.”

Webb was back in action after her record
breaking last weekend at ODACs. She ran
the 1500 meter race in a time of 4:46.80,
making her the ﬁrst D-III competitor in the
event to cross the ﬁnish line (she was 7th
place overall).

“The 1500 went pretty well. I dropped

about 3 seconds from my best 1500 time
this season (from 4:49 to 4:46), so I’m
pleased,” she said.

Webb said the competition was tough.
“The race went out really fast. I tried to stay
up with a group of Va Tech girls, but I just
couldn’t hold the pace.”

The winning time came in at 4:28.

Now, as Webb looks towards the end
of the season, she is hoping to drop more
time in order to qualify for nationals. How-
ever, Webb remains optimistic that if she
does not make nationals this year, she has
“two more years of solid training to try to
get there.”

The Generals have a week off before the
Lynchburg Last Chance Meet on Friday,
May 18.

The Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team advanced
to the quarterﬁ-

scores rials of the NCAA
W&L 5 team tournament
UMW 0 with two 5-0 vic-

tories over No. 15

Swarthmore and
No. 10 Mary Washington. W&L
was selected as a host for ﬁrst
three rounds of the national play-
offs and received a ﬁrst-round
bye based on their No. 3 ranking
they compiled during the regular
season. ‘

In the ﬁrst round, Swarthmore
cruised past Cabrini College 5-0
to advance and face the Generals,
However, their ride through the
tournament came to a screeching
halt when they faced off against
the Generals.

The Generals got off to a
strong start by sweeping the dou-
bles competition. In ﬁrst doubles,
senior Emily Applegate teamed
with senior Kristen McClung to
defeated Swarthmore’s number
one duo of Sonya Reynolds and
Sara Sargent 8-3. Swarthmore’s
number two team of Marissa Mat-

thews and Erica Lukoski were
no match for W&L’s sophomore
Katie Tabb and senior‘ Ginny
Wortham, falling 8-2. In third
doubles, W&L’s pair of freshmen
Lauren Caire and junior Leah
Weston defeated Waverly Lutz
and Rachel Wallwork 8-4 to com-
plete the sweep.

In singles, the Generals
only needed to win twolof the
six matches to move on. After
Wortham defeated Reynolds 6-0,
6-0 and McClung beat Sargent
6-2, 6-1, the match was ended
because the Generals had already
locked up the victory. '

In the other four matches,
Tabb, junior Kelly Will, Weston,
and Caire had all won the ﬁrst set
and were leading or tied in the
second. With the victory, the Gen-
erals moved on to play the win-
ner of Johns Hopkins and Mary
Washington.

In the other second round
match on Saturday, Johns Hop-
kins came out strong against Mary
Washington by sweeping the dou-
bles matches by scores of 9-8, 8-
6, and 8-6, to take a 3-0 lead.

However, Mary Washington
stormed back, dropping only one
of six singles matches to steal a 5-

4 victory and advance to the third
round against W&L.

The Generals started strong in
the doubles matches again, with
the team of Applegate and Mc-
Clung defeating Mary Washing-
ton’s Stephanie Kurti and Becky
Morse—Karzen 8-3 in number
one doubles. Tabb and Wortham
teamed up to defeat Natalia Fu-
gate and Katie Miglin 8-1.

W&L looked like they would
sweep the doubles matches as
Caire and Weston jumped out to a
7-1 lead in number three doubles.
However, Mary Washington’s

Kate Malpeli and Stacey Rickard ‘

came alive and evened the match
at 7-7.

In the next game with Caire
serving, Caire and Weston held
off four break points before tak-
ing the game to go up 8-7.

After Mary Washington held
serve, the match went to a cru-
cial seven point tiebreak. The
momentum of the match hinged
on the outcome of the game. If
the Generals could hold on after
giving up their lead and sweep
the doubles matches, they would
need just two singles wins to ad-
vance to the quarterﬁnals but if
Mary Washington could pull off a

“The meet went really well and
was a lot of fun. I was really ex-

was only my second time doing a
Heptathlon. I was able to improve
on a few of my events and am
looking forward to competing in
another Heptathlon because there

stunning come-from-behind win,
they would have the momentum
to pull off another surprising
comeback in the singles.

Caire and.Weston got off to a
quick start, with Weston tallying
an ace and two winners before the
pair watched Mary Washington
double fault, giving the Generals
a 4-0 lead. Mary Washington won
three of the next ﬁve to bring the
