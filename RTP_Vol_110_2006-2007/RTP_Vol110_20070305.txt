On Friday, March 2. 2007.
W&L held its second Science.
Society, and the Arts Confer-
ence. Students from both the
undergraduate and law schools
along with members of the
faculty participated in book
discussions. presented paper

began about ﬁve years ago. says
professor and chair of the con-
ference, Robin LeBlanc. Dr.
LcBlanc said she was trying to
think of ways to build bridges
between Williams School stu-
dents and other W&L students
when the idea for a research
conference occurred to her.

Her proposal was accepted
by faculty members on a Wil-
liams school retreat. and soon
after a committee of faculty.
students, and volunteers was
formed to plan the event. The
ﬁrst SSA Conference was held
in November 2004.

This year the conference
was again run by a committee.
and over 200 students and fac-
ulty members participated.

“The W&L community has
responded with tremendous
enthusiasm," says Dr. LeBlanc.
“I am amazed by the kinds of
works students have proposed
to present.”

The material presented dur-
ing the day was indeed diverse.
covering everything from real-
ity television to nuclear weap-
ons policy. Students shared
work from study abroad expe-

riences, senior theses and inde-
pendent study projects.

Groups of students and
professors gathered to discuss
reading on topics such as gen-
der. se.\'uality, and religion.
The Art Showing provided an
e.\'hibition of paintings and art-
work.

Scientiﬁc research was pre-
sented on topics from student
alcohol use to “The Kinetics of
the llydrolysis of Bisacodyl.”
Students also presented origi-
nal creative work including
ﬁlm and play readings.

In the evening a dance re-
cital was held in Keller The-

°Schoo| explains hazing hotline

Anonymous website has been used this year, but administration still uses other resources

By Hllary Craig
STAFF WRITER

During the dreary months of
January through March, fatigued
freshmen males at Washington
and Lee University are seen fall-
ing asleep in class, wearing coat
and ties daily, and making peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches on
an ironing board in front of Ley-
burn.

Welcome to pledgeship.

During the eight weeks of
“new member education.” begin-
ning with tear night and culminat-
ing with the alleged “hell week“,
freshmen males are supposed to
be learning about brotherhood.
albeit through largely secret and
controversial methods (i.e. haz-

.I

ing). Hazing is deﬁned as a ha-
rassing. excessive task associated
with initiation or membership in
an organization. It involves mis-
treatment of prospective mem-
bers by those who exercise con-
trol over them.

Both students and administra-
tion are attempting to make Greek
life at W&l., a more positive expe-
rience. primarily by putting a stop
to hazing.

“This is an honorable place,
people are supposed to exhibit
honorable behavior." said Direc-
tor of Public Safety Mike Young.
“Hazing is not honorable and it‘s
dangerous."

Nearly four years ago, after a
series of hazing incidents, a corn-
mittee eonvened to determine

“This is an honorable place, people are sup-

posed to exhibit honorable behavior Hazing is

not honorable and its dangerous. ”

MIKE YOUNG, Director of Public Safety
 

what should be done to stop haz-
ing. The committee recommend-
ed having a W&L hazing hotline
as an opportunity for sources to
report hazing incidents while re-
maining completely anonymous.
Studcnts can access the hazing
website at http://hazing.wlu.edu
and send any concerns directly
to Dawn Watkins. Dean of Stu-
dents.

According to Greek Life Di-
rector Jason Rodocker, the admin-
istration has no way of ﬁnding out
who sent the email.

“The university does not do
anything to violate the anonymity
of the email,” said Rodocker.

While all emails are taken se-
riously, it is often hard or even
impossible to follow up on vague
emails. Both Rodocker and Young

adamantly encouraged speciﬁc
information and as much identi-
ﬁcation as a person is willing to
offer.

“Clearly, a message with detail
and someone to follow up with al-
lows us to be much more effec-
tive,” said Rodocker.

While the hotline is “a le-
gitimate opportunity to report
things,” said Young, it is just
one way that the administration
receives reports of hazing. The
administrators receive informa-
tion from a wide range of sources,
including people who work with
W&L, parents, active fraternity
and sorority members, new mem-
bers, RAs and DCs, peer counsel-
ors, and independent students.

While some are concerned

that the majority of tips the hot-
line receives are unfounded, the
administration is conscious of the
possibility that the anonymous
emails are either not accurate or
exaggerated. A single anonymous
email does not warrant a full in-
vestigation.

“Any house that was investi-
gated this year, we received mul-
tiple reports from multiple sourc-
es on multiple occasions, which
when cross-referenced revealed
information to warrant an inves-
tigation,” said Rodocker. “There
are deﬁnitely no witch-hunts go-
ing on.”

reports about the behavior of a

Chi Omega is chili cook-oﬂon C
Saturday raised money for the
Make a Wish Foundation.

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

fter 20 hours of cooking,

the Chemistry Depart-

ment’s “Hazmat Chili”
was bound to taste good. Profes-
sors Steven Desjardins, Marcia
France and Fred LaRiviere stood
behind signs urging everyone to
try out Chilium, the newly dis-
covered element 138.

These professors took ﬁrst
place and joined 16 other teams on
Saturday at Chi Omega’s Make a
Wish chili cook-off. Teams came
from academic departments, fra-
ternities and other campus orga-
nizations. Each group paid a $75
entry fee to compete.

Chi O juniors Mallory Frewer
and Briana‘ Gregory have been
planning the event since last Oc-
tober. Frewer said she came up
with the idea to help her house
meet its goal of fulﬁlling one
wish each year through the Make
a Wish Foundation.

:‘,;We  to recruit teams
thiggtigh iinyitations» to fratemities,
aca'Hemic"“'dep‘artrr‘rents and all of
the campus organizations,” Frew-
er said. “We’re trying to start a
tradition of doing a wish each
year, and those usually take about
$5,000-$7,000.”

The organizers also sent out
invitations and entry forms to lo-
cal schools, churches, businesses
and community service groups.
Frewer said the invitations ex-
plained the event and why Chi
O was organizing it, but no local
groups decided to get involved
and enter the contest.

Frewer said she is still adding
up ﬁnal totals but thinks the event
raised about $3,500. Money was
raised through the entry fees, at
ﬁve dollar fee to sample and vote
on the chili and a raffle of items
donated by local businesses.

Each team worked to bring its
distinctive style to the table. Chi
O’s Red Hot team battled with
Sigma Nu’s squad to see who had
the spiciest dish.

Bill Larson, a Sigma Nu se-
nior, said his fraternity brothers
used his family recipe.

“We found out about the event

from some of the Chi 0 sisters,”
Larson said, “so a bunch of us got
together and cooked this up yes-
terday afternoon.”

Kelly Hemminger, the Biology
Department’s molecular techni-
cian, said her team -- which won
second place -- was calling itself
the Capsaicin Crew. Capsaicin is
a molecule in peppers that can im-

prove your health.
“We’re promoting the health
_beneﬁts,” Hemminger said.’

“Capsaicin can lower bad choles-
terol, raise your endorphins and
up your metabolism.”

To make sure nobody forgot
about the molecule’s health ben-
eﬁts, Hemminger and her team
put up a poster and a model of the
molecule. She said, however, that
her team decided not to add too
many spicy peppers.

“We decided to focus on taste
over health,” she said.

Her team succeeded on the
taste front, ﬁxing up a nice dish
made with chicken and chorizo
sausage.

Desjardins said the chemis-

try team made its recipe with six ’

pounds of ground chuck roast.
After cutting it up, they stuck it in
a crock pot and let it simmer for
20 hours. To make sure everyone
could ﬁnd their station, the chem-
ists put up an enormous trident
brand on the table.

While the chemistry professors
stuck with lab coats and goggles,
Greatful Chili broke out tie-dye
t-shirts for the event and the jour-
nalism department wore hats that
print setters at the Roanoke Times
used to wear. Department chair
Brian Richardson and department
secretary Melissa Cox called their
entree “Joumalist’s chili — What
a crock.” Their recipe worked in
unusual ingredients like choco-
late, pecans and beer, giving it a
unique ﬂavor.

Frewer said the sorority will
receive information about pos-
sible wish candidates once the
event’s total revenues are added
up.

“We’re hoping we can pair
with someone nearby so we can
stay involved with that person and
help with their wish,” she said.

chapter, the Inter-fraternity
Council (IFC) or Rodocker con-
ducts a “preliminary inquiry,” the
ﬁrst step toward an investigation.
During the inquiry the IF C ques-
tions the chapter, or the chapter
meets with Rodocker.

“The results could be that
things get cleared up, or that
they do not get cleared up,” said
Rodocker.

If the IFC and administration
still have concerns, Young con-
ducts a formal investigation and
issues a report to the IFC. It is the
lFC’s job to have a hearing and
consider the report and any other
information it has from talking
to chapter members and officers.
The members look at the totality

of circumstances and make a de-
cision based on what they think is
best for the Greek system and the
chapter. Rodocker applauded the
IFC’s attempt to improve Greek
life without losing traditions that
are worth keeping.

“The IF C ofﬁcers give an
enormous amount of time to a
volunteer position in an effort to
do what is best for the Greek sys-
tem by preserving and improving
it,” he said.

However, with respect to haz-
ing issues, the IFC’s decision is
not the ﬁnal outcome. It is simply
a recommendation that goes to
the Student Affairs Committee,
which consists of half faculty and
half students and is chaired by
Dean Watkins. This committee’s
decision is the ﬁnal outcome.

Currently, both the Phi Gam-
ma Delta (FIJI) and Kappa Sig-
ma chapters at W&L are being
investigated for “behavior they
shouldn’t have exhibited and
wasn’t part of their new member
education,” said Young.

FIJI’s President Andrew
Rothey and Kappa Sigma’s in-
coming President George Hunter
will not comment until the ﬁnal
adjudication by the Student Af-
fairs Committee, which is expect-
ed to come within the next three
weeks.

“The conﬁdentiality of it is in-
tended to protect the chapter be-
fore the full facts are determined
and before any decision is made,”
said Rodocker. “We don’t want to
encourage the rumor mill or taint
the process.”

According to Young, the haz-
ing hotline has been a complete
success.

“Before we had this, we didn’t
have the opportunity for students
to give us this information,” said
Young. “It allows an area for
people to report sensitive infor-
mation, but it’s a shame that you
have to be anonymous to report
things.”

Rodocker agreed that the hot-
line has had a positive effect on
the Greek system, but empha-
sized that it is only a small part of
the investigation process.

“Focusing on the hotline
would not be an accurate assess-
ment by itself,” said Rodocker.
“The majority of anything that’s
come out this year has not come
directly from the hotline.”

 Hazing inquiries continue

While big improvements have
been made to the Greek system
over the past few years, the ad-
ministration still hopes for more
changes.

“I would love to see chapters
have conversations about ways
to build brotherhood that would
be transparent,” said Rodocker.
“You could do worthwhile activi-
ties on Canaan Green and not be
embarrassed.”

Young agrees that pledgeship
should be focused on building
healthy relationships, which does
not include causing harm to fel-
low “brothers.”

“I wish our students were
more humane and caring about
their fellow students and would
not allow themselves to do harm-
ful things to others,” he said.

let, Jazz, Tap, Hip Hop, and Con-
.temporary Modern Dance perfor-
mances.

The day culminated in a lun-
cheon and address by keynote
speaker Mario Livio. Dr. Livio
is a Senior Astrophysicist at the
Hubble Space Telescope Science
Institute.

He gave an engaging talk
titled: “Symmetry: From Human
Perception and Mate Selection to
the Laws of Nature.” Dr. Livio’s

.address covered key concepts
from his new book, “The Equa-
tion That C.ouldn’t Be Solved:
How Mathematical Genius Dis-
covered the Language of Sym-
metry.” Following his talk, Dr.
Livio held a book signing in the
Elrod Commons.

The diversity of talent and
research exhibited by partici-
pants during the conference is a
testament to the vivacity of in-
tellectual life at W&L, says Dr.
LeBlanc, a life that too often gets
overlooked by students in wake

of the school’s thriving social at-
mosphere.

That’s really the point of SSA,
continues Dr. LeBlanc, “to remind
ourselves that it’s really cool to be
a learner and a teacher and to be
involved in college life.”

Dr. LeBlanc says the most
satisfying part of the day are the
huge smiles on students’ faces as
they celebrate “The Life of The
Mind.”

These smiles were indeed
evident throughout the day as
students, faculty members, and
members of the community com-
memorated intellectual achieve-
ment.

At the luncheon Dr. LeBlanc
also announced exciting news:
the conference has just received
$50,000, enough money to secure
at least two more SSA events in
future years.

The applause and overwhelm-
ing support exhibited by the W&L
community at the news suggest
that the day will indeed become a
traditioneone that will continue
to acknowledge W&L’s intellec-
tual life well into the future.

Pause your iPod and try something new. Learn musical
trivia and expose yourself to a few unheard of artists

By Dylan Merrill
COLUMNIST

First of all, I’d like to say that
this article is a gift to you, noble
reader.

Let me explain with a few
pieces of rock and roll trivia:

° Stevie Wonder’s real name is
Steveland Hardaway Judkins

0 When Elvis Presley was draft-
ed into the Army in 1958, his
monthly salary dropped ﬁom
$100,000 to $78.

0 Although the root of the maga-
zine Rolling Stone's name is
widely debated, many have cit-
ed the songs of blues musician
Howlin' Wolf and folk god Bob
Dylan as the original source of
the magazine’s moniker.

- Having previously sent a few
demo records in search of a
contract, the Beatles received a
dismissing letter from the Decca
‘Recording Company that said,
"We don't like their sound and
guitar music is on the way out."

~ Folk singer Paul Simon got
the title of his song "Mother and
Child Reunion" from the name

of a chicken-and-egg dish at a
Chinese restaurant.

- The rights to the South Caro-
lina state anthem are owned by
Michael Jackson.

- When Prince decided to be-
come a Jehovah's Witness in
2001, at least 50 songs were too
explicit to be performed.

- The most valuable guitar in the
world “Blackie,” is a Fender
Stratocaster once owned by Eric
Clapton and it is worth almost a
million dollars

- Jimmy Page, founding mem- '

ber of Led Zeppelin, played as
a session guitarist on the Tom
Jones hit, "It’s Not Unusual."

- According to guitarist Robbie
Robertson, Bob Dylan's back-
ing band vowed to resist con-
formity, which included giving
their band a name. Their record
company later pressured them
into naming themselves, but the

See? Music is interesting.

The new reality t.v. series
"I'm from Rolling Stone" has
recently brought criticism to the
program's featured magazine,
which is known for its roasting
of generic and ridiculous reality
shows.

Regardless of its criticism,
Rolling Stone’s reality show is
laudable, because it shows that
they are both observers and par-
ticipants in popular culture.

Why don’t we try this? I
mean why can’t we just stop
Facebooking and listen to some
music or read a book? There’s a
lot of culture out there...

So do me a favor: pause your

Hazing hotline is a good resource, but school
should not expect a totally public pledgeship

Campus has been buzzing
this winter with news — or ru-
mors — about the anonymous
hazing hotline.

Everyone has a new story
about which fraternity has
just been turned in, who’s
under investigation or who’s
back in the clear. Nobody can
agree on how exactly the hot-
line works.

The on-line hazing hot-
line is undoubtedly a good
resource for freshmen as they
go through pledgeship, and
it’s reassuring to see that the
administration — in theory
— is relying on more than just
anonymous tips when it in-
vestigates the activities being
held by different fraternities.

The IFC has established
a solid track record of rec-
ognizing what should and
should not be permitted dur-
ing pledgeship. Though they
oﬁen rely on Mike Young
and the Public Safety Depart-
ment for assistance with their
investigations, the decisions
about punishments should
stay inside the IFC.

If W&L trusts students to
govern and administer the
Honor System, that same trust

should be extended to the fra-
ternity system. Is the Student
Affairs Committee — a group
comprised of administrators,
faculty and student leaders
— really more qualiﬁed than
the IFC to judge fraternities?

But the administration
must keep working hard to
avoid basing investigations
off of hearsay and rumor.
DCs, parents and indepen-
dents can all provide valuable
tips about hazing, but none
of those groups are actually
present when hazing occurs.
Anyone who spends more
than 48 hours on this campus
knows how stories mutate and
grow “almost instantaneously.
The only 100 percent reliable
sources are the pledges and
upperclassmen present when
pledgeship activities occur.

Aﬁer hazing problems
both at W&L and nationwide,
a focus on stopping hazing is
appropriate. Nobody in the
student body or administra-
tion wants to see another frat
house leﬁ empty after a haz-
ing scandal. Between Beta
and Sig Ep, W&L has seen
enough frats thrown out dur-
ing the last four years.

While the focus on haz-
ing is relevant and appropri-
ate, the administration has
unreasonable expectations
for its fraternities. Yes, as
Jason Rodocker suggested,
perhaps more pledgeship ac-
tivities could be held in pub-
lic (Phi Psi already does this,
but maybe that’s not what he
meant).

But fraternities should
not be required — or even
expected — to conduct all of
their business in the public
eye. There’s a reason each
house keeps the chapter room
locked.

There is a middle ground
here. Fraternities should be
able to shape their pledge
classes without falling back
on pointless physical punish-
ments and without the admin-
istration peering over their
shoulder.

There’s an issue of trust at
stake here. The fraternities
need to believe that the ad-
ministration is not out to get
each house in trouble. At the
same time, the administra-
tion must give the fraternities
some leeway and privacy to
conduct pledgeship.

Working with a Houston charity turned nameless faces into real people

ine. That’s the average
age of a homeless person
in Houston, Texas.

If all the men, women, and
children people who are homeless
in Houston decided to sleep in the
beds provided by the numerous
shelters, thousands would have to
spend the night in the cold.

Half of the homeless popula-
tion deals with either a mental or
physical disability.

Not all homeless people are
drug addicts or uneducated, con-
trary to stereotypes.

Fiﬁeen students, myself in-
cluded, leamed all the above
while volunteering at a day shel-
ter in Houston for a week.

As part of the Nabors-spon-
sored alternative break, we
worked with SEARCH. The
Houston alumni chose SEARCH
for us to work with because it fo-
cuses on helping homeless people
reach self-sufficiency.

SEARCH has a job training
center that includes GED classes,
healthcare, a day care for home-
less children whose parents are
usually attending classes or work-
ing, a van for giving out food and
offering services, and a cater-
ing company where the culinary
graduates can work.

Each one of us said the week
was eye-opening.

We worked with all the pro-
grams, but the most memorable
was the Mobile Outreach, where
we actually handed out sandwich-
es and talked to the people who

were homeless.

I admit that before this trip, I
would always avert my eyes when
I saw a homeless person outside
stores or by the freeway. I didn’t
want to see them and I deﬁnitely
didn’t want to help them.

I thought that they didn’t de-
serve my pity or my money and
if I did give money, I assumed.it
would promptly be spent on alco-
hol or drugs instead of on food or
clothing.

I even justiﬁed my behavior by
saying that no one wants pity and
that money would only continue
a vicious cycle, so I was saving
them a lot of trouble.

Excuses.

Yes, some of the people I met
had been addicted to drugs. Yes, I
saw people with disabilities. And
yes, no one I met wanted or need-
ed my pity.

In Houston, I met a man in his
ﬁfties who had a business degree
and ran his own restaurant before
he lost both of his legs in a hor-
rendous accident.

Suddenly unable to walk, he
lost his business, his family, and
his home.

He turned to drugs. He lived
under an interstate overpass. He
knew the people from SEARCH

for more than year before he
was ready to leave the streets.
SEARCH helped him enroll in a
detox program. ’‘

He works for SEARCH’s ca-
tering service and speaks to others
about his time when he was home-
less. He now also walks with the
help of artiﬁcial legs bought with
contributions from the program’s
donors.

While giving out sandwiches,
we met people who were on the
streets for different reasons.

People who knew what
SEARCH does would run down
the van signaling us to stop.

We also met people who
waved us on. That was a surprise
because I thought that everyone
would be happy and grateful for
the van’s services.

Our team leader, Don, who
himself used to be homeless, told
us that people may have enough
food already or would not want to
be bothered.

I was also impressed that
SEARCH did not push people to
come to the building for help. A
person has to be ready to come off
the streets.

For people who are ready,
SEARCH employees are al-
ways available. Our team leaders

knew the people by name that we
stopped for and would hand out
their card with cell phone num-
bers on it.

Everything revolved around
the client.

I had never thought about how
hard it would be to get a job when
you’re homeless.

The Urban Plunge gave W&L
students the actual experience oi
being homeless, and SEARCH
is the next logical step. They of-
fer food, laundry, showers, com-
puters, voicemail service, and so
much more.

The people we met were
homeless because of job losses,
mistakes, and other unexpected
and uncontrollable reasons.

These people were smart, had
the skills for a job and made an
effort. None of them had planned
on becoming homeless. They
didn’t deserve what had happened
to them, but they were working
past that.

I guess before the trip I had
never really thought of the home-
less people I saw on the streets as
really people. In my mind, they
lost their identity. But the people
we met surprised us all. They had
lives, families and degrees.

I still won’t give money to the
people I see in front of stores or
by the freeway but for different
reasons. Don told us that money
would not make a positive dif-
ference but helping out at a local
shelter would be a better choice.

As one of the other people on
the trip said, I may never go home
again. I just want to volunteer on
trips for the rest of my time here.

I.

Many Washington and Lee
students have never heard of
I11 Noise, the band that won the
$1,000 first prize at last Friday’s
Battle of the Bands, and for good
reason. Until two weeks ago the
band never existed, said band
member Derin Harrison.

Ill Noise, whose name came
from the word Illinois, was origi-
nally started by seniors Frank Lee,-
Sam Wilmoth and Harrison. Lee,
a native of Chicago, is credited
with coming up with the band’s
name despite the fact, he claimed,
that some members didn’t like it.
As friends they always thought
about forming a band, he said.

The band ended up with a total
of six members. Others include
students DeVarion Jarelle “DJ”
Carter, Jameson Graber and Chris
Rucker. ‘

Before their performance,
the band practiced for about 20
hours, experimenting with differ-
ent songs and sounds.

“It was just a bunch of us hav-
ing fun,” said Harrison. “Our big-
gest problem was focus.”

Yet the members were surpris-
ingly modest about their award,
saying that they never expected to
win. Rucker seemed overwhelmed
with enthusiasm, comparing the
night to the Grammys.

The event, organized by the
General Activities Board and Stu-
dent Activities, included a total of
eight bands, each of which per-
formed at the Doremus Gym.

111 Noise’s biggest challeng-
ers were Velva Bar Lights who
placed second, winning $500, and
Dr. Kenneth and the Googleplex,
who ﬁnished third, winning a
$250 prize.

Although many bands came
out with clean, precise music,
Harrison and Lee summed up their
strength in one word: energy.

“We moved the crowd more

“It was just a bunch of us having fun. Our big-

gest problem was focus. ’

J

DERIN HARRISON, class of 2007
 

than the other bands,” said Har-
rison.

Combining hip-hop and R&B
with the sounds of jazz and rock,
the band achieved a unique sound
that seemed to get the crowd
dancing and waving to the beat.
Rucker began the performance
by rapping to Jay-Z’s “Show Me
What You Got.”

Lee later wowed the audience
with his freestyling, and Harrison
stood out by jamming with his
saxophone, giving the songs a
different vibe. DJ Carter pounded
the drums, Graber played the gui-
tar and Wilmoth played the bass.
The band took audience participa-
tion one step further when Rucker
jumped off stage, handing plastic
red roses to cheering audience
members.

“I really wanted a rose so I
could feel special! So I reached
for one when he started handing
them out, so yeah I was pretty
much ecstatic to get one,” said
freshman Kim Holland.

According to the contest rules,
bands were judged on four criteria:
musicianship, originality,’ stage
presence and overall impressions.
The judges’ votes were worth 75
percent while the crowd’s reac-
tion was worth 25 percent.

Yet the night was off to a rough
start with the ﬂrst band Sheep
Herders. Despite its unusual
name and equally unusual sound,
the band didn’t seem to “herd” the
enthusiasm of many of the audi-
ence members. The instruments
drowned out the singers’ voices,
and this reporter could not hear
the lyrics clearly.

Agent Flynn, led by singer CJ
Boyd, got the event started with

their raw rock and roll vibe. The
band sang cover songs by The
Clash and The Rolling Stones. At
one point, electric guitarist Joel
Poelhuis revved up the crowd by

jumping from the stage and jam-

ming to the music.

Second place Velva Bar
Lights provided a strong con-
trast to Agent Flyrm’s rock and
roll sound, including songs such
as Bob Dylan’s “All Along the
Watchtower.”

Students close to the stage
momentarily waved their lighters
and cell phones to the pop music
of band Jon Bovi. However, lead
singer of the band Matt Amling
couldn’t hide his lack of memo-
rization from the audience or the
judges as he constantly looked
down at the lyrics placed on the
music stand in front of him.

Third place winner Dr. Ken-
neth and the Googleplex sang
Stevie Wonder’s “Superstition”
and Marvin Gaye’s “Sexual Heal-
ing,” creating a Motown feel to
the band.

Their performance included
beatboxing by lead singer Mal-
colm Hines and a drum solo by
Spencer McElroy. Other bands
included Conviction, who sang

their original song “Immortal

Man” and Bluegrass band Rikki
Tikki Tavi’s performance came
complete with a banjo and a har-
monica. ‘

Freshman Rasaq Lawal, who
commented on how loud the
music was, was seen wearing
“fashionable” orange earplugs
throughout the concert to soﬁen
the volume.

“[The music] was beating
against my chest,” he said.

atop the rankings and is fol-
lowed by Guilford, Hunting-
don, Whitworth, Transylvania,
Oglethorpe, Rhodes, W&L,
Wisconsin-Eau Claire and St.
John’s (Minn.). The Generals

The W&L Riding Team has had
great results so far in their winter
and spring seasons. Starting their
winter campaign with a strong
ﬁfth-place ﬁnish at Sweet Briar
College, the Generals went on
to claim the Reserve Title at
the Bridgewater College IHSA
show. The Generals defeated
perennial powerhouses UVA
and Hollins at the Bridgewater
show. Part of their success can be
contributed to their year-round
training, which has clearly made
a diﬁerence for the Generals. At
the Bridgewater College IHSA,
co-captains Kiltie Tompkins and
Lilly Haywood captured ﬁrst
place ribbons, while Alice Shih
and Brooks Vardell captured
second place in their respective
events for the Generals. Four
additional riders qualified to
ride at the IHSA Regionals held
last weekend at UVA. Brynne
Archer had already qualified
earlier in the season, and she was
joined by Sarah Bujtas, Kathryn
George, and co-captains Brittany
Bansak and Lilly Haywood.
Ashley Billman ﬁnished third in
Open Over Fences, at Bridgewa-
ter’s meet while Vardell ﬁnished
ﬁﬁh. In the Intermediate Fences,
Kiltie Tompkins ﬁnished in ﬁﬂh
place. Brittany Bansak ﬁnished
ﬁfth in the Novice Fences, while
Brynne Archer ﬁnished sixth. In
the Open Flat, Vardell captured
second place for the Generals,
while Billman ﬁnished in ﬁlth.
In Intermediate Flats, Kiltie
Tompkins and Lilly Haywood
tied for ﬁrst place, while Cath-
erine Hook took fourth place in
Novice Flat. Alice Shih ﬁnished
second in Walk-Trot-Canter,
while Hila Yashar ﬁnished fourth
in Walk-Trot. At Sweet Briar
College, Billman ﬁnished sec-
ond in the Open Flat. Bansak
ﬁnished third in the Novice Flat
while George ﬁnished fourth in

Track sets records

Teams break seven records as women ﬁnish second and men ﬁfth at ODAC meets

By Michael Fahey
sponrs canon

he Washington and Lee

I men’s and women’s track

teams ﬁnished their indoor

campaigns with impressive show-

ings at the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Championships.

The women ﬁnished second
out of ﬁve times, while the men
placed four out of six teams.

The W&L women set a new
school record for the most points
recorded in ODAC champion-
ships with 161 points, and they
lost to champion Roanoke Col-
lege by a mere 13 points.

The Generals had ﬁve confer-
ence champions, 13 all-confer-
ence citations, set two confer-
ence championship records and,
most impressively, toppled seven
school records throughout the
course of the meets.

The W&L women accumulat-
ed 161 points, three more points
than the highest-ever winning to-
tal in ODAC Championship his-
tory but 13 points fewer than the
total scored by Roanoke College.
The men tallied 42 points.

Leading the way for the wom-
en was sophomore Stacy Doom-
bos, who competed in an incredi-
ble seven events for the Generals.
The star was the champion in the
triple jump and ﬁnished second in
the long jump and the high jump.
Doombos also crossed the line
fourth in the 400 meters and sixth
in the 200 meters.

Freshman Maggie Sutherland
also was a key contributor for
the Generals, competing in ﬁve
events, capturing ﬁrst in the high
jump and third in the triple jump.
Sutherland set a new record in the
55 meter hurdles, besting her own
time from an earlier meet.

Junior Elizabeth Brandler
ﬁnished second in the pole vault
and ﬁfth in the triple jump (9.86
In), and sophomore Jackie Burns
placed second in the 5,000 me-
ters with a school-record time
and ﬁnished third in the mile. The
Distance Medley Relay squad
crossed the ﬁnish line ﬁrst, setting
a meet record.

Sophomore Becca Taylor won

the mile with a school-record and-

meet-record time of 5:17.42 and
also placed sixth in the 800 me-
ters and fourth in the 5,000 me-
ters. Freshman Elizabeth Kraus-
nick won the 800 meters with a

®ToYoTA I moving forward > ® 

meet-record and school-record

time of 2:23.88, while sophomore
Elizabeth Webb placed second in
the 800 meters, also setting a new
school record.

Going into the spring outdoor
season, the Generals have a lot to
look forward to and a great deal
to be proud of. “Everyone seemed
to put their heart into the meet be-
cause we knew we not only had a
chance at coming home with ﬁrst
place, but we were prepared to do
it,” Brandler said.

Doombos said that the wom-
en’s season was a great success.
“Overall the season was great. It
was a lot of fun having so many
new freshmen on the team that
really stepped up and had a great
indoor season,” she said.

Taylor said the support of her
teammates was crucial.

“It’s amazing how well this
team works together and supports
each other. For instance, one of
my events last weekend was the
5000 meters. And even though
this is usually a very long, dull
25 lap race, the whole team lined
the track cheering and yelling for
us.  I know it was the support of
the team that made all the differ-
ence,” she said.

On the men’s side, the Gener-
als were once again led by fresh-
man Billy Billington, who ﬁnished
second in the shot put and ﬁfth in

the weight’ throw. *1=’re'shman Ben '

Goetsch, who joined the indoor
track team at the conclusion of the
men’s basketball season, placed
second in the high jump, and
sophomore Drew Martin ﬁnished
third in the pole vault

The Generals 4x400 meter
relay team of Chip McCoy, Mar-
shall French, Brian Bondurant
and Matt Harrison placed third
overall, while the Distance Med-
ley Relay squad of Alex Jackson,
Harrison, Rob Saliers and Welsh
placed fourth.

Billington said the indoor sea-
son was a success, but he expects
better results as the team shifts to
outdoor competition.

“The indoor season went well
and most everyone improved
throughout the season. The team
is almost all freshmen and sopho-
mores, so we expect to improve
as we become more experienced.
 I expect our practice to pay off
as we enter the outdoor season
and hopefully we can improve,”
he said.

against Hollins. Tabb won 6-1, 6-0 at first singles, and
teamed with freshman Lauren Calre to win first doubles.

her opponent 6-1, 6-1.

Juniors Lauren Cook and Ka-
tie Duncan were victorious at ﬁfth
and sixth singles. Cook won 6-1,
6-0, while Duncan didn’t surren-
der a single game winning 6-0,
6-0.

In doubles, Will paired with
Christmas for an 8-1 victory at
ﬁrst doubles, while Haines and
Proctor paired together for a 8-2
victory at second doubles.

Cook_and Duncan were victo-
rious as third doubles by a score
of 8-1. The team is extremely
deep, returning all of last year’s
starters.

Christmas said, “We deﬁnitely
have depth. [Head Coach] Cinda
[Rankin] schedules us two match-
es in the same day and can send
half the team to the away match
and keep half the team to play at
home.”

Not only does the team have
great depth, but it also features
girls that are capable of playing
anywhere in the lineup, depend-
ing on the opponent.

Weston added, “We are fortu-
nate to have a team with depth.
Regardless of what position
someone plays they still are able

minds, but we have to focus on one match at a

time, because if you don ’t teams will surprise you

to compete strongly at their posi-
tion or at a higher position against
various teams.”

Aside from their demeanor
on the courts and the perennial
dynasty that the Generals have
established, the team is close off
the court too.

Weston said, “We have a team
with great chemistry, which has
deﬁnitely impacted how well we
have done in previous years. Not
only are we teammates but we
are very good friends. Being so
close to everyone on the team is
probably the greatest strength we
have besides having talented ten-
nis players,” she said.

Intercollegiate experience is
not the only place where the Gen-
erals have expertise.

Woitham said‘, “I think one of
the greatest aspects of our team
is that everyone is a great tennis

player and comes in with a solid

junior career behind her. We,
therefore, we have so much depth
on our team that we constantly
push our teammates to be better.”

The Generals are a highly
talented team, with players that
come in with an extensive back-
ground in the sport. The players
also have different styles of play,
which is a major strength.

Bouret said, “Our team is ﬁlled
with so many players of different
playing styles, which makes us a
very tough team to play against.”

With three seniors in the top
six for the Generals, there is a
great deal of leadership on the
team, which is excellent for the
younger players on the team.

— Bouret said, “Our seniors have
been so supportive and serve as
great role models for the rest of
the team. I’m very happy to be
a freshman on such a talented
team; it deﬁnitely keeps me on

my toes.”

The Generals also have a new
assistant coach who has been
helping the team out in various
different ways.

Christmas said, “Doubles hurt
us last season, so our new assis-
tant coach Eric is really helping
us work on that. I think he’s doing
a really good job of keeping us all
focused. Nationals is deﬁnitely in
the back of everyone’s minds, but
we have to focus on one match at
a time, because if you don’t teams
will surprise you.”

As the team continues with
their campaign, they have main
different goals in mind.

Tabb said, “Obviously we’re
competing against the best of the
best -- especially when we have
to play each other at individuals,
but I’d like to keep a strong re-
cord this year. And unfortunately,
the individual event takes place
right after the team event [at the
NCAA Tournament], so there’s
always the chance that you play
at the team event and have to
turn around and play a teammate,
which is a necessary evil in any
individual sport.”

W&L, currently ranked third
nationally, next returns to action

on Tuesday at Randolpph,-,Mpg)n.

I Wrestlers wrap up strong season

Young but experienced teamﬁnishes the Generals ’best conference tournament result in several years

By Mike Fahey
spams zmroa

With eight wins and the best
ﬁnish that the team has seen in
almost a decade, the Washington
and Lee wrestling team can only
take positives away from their
2006-2007 campaign.

It was a season full of accom-
plishments. With their ﬁfth place
ﬁnish out of eight teams, it was
the ﬁrst time that the Generals
had ﬁnished out oflast place since
the 1999-2000 season, and it was
W&L best result since ﬁnishing
ﬁfth at the Centennial Conference
championships during their 1998-
1998 campaign.

Also, the Generals had the
most meet victories since the
1985-1986 season, and knocked

off the top two teams in the Cen-
tennial Conference. Ursinus, one
of the teams that W&L upset,
had been undefeated in 27 con-
secutive conference matches. The
Blue and White handed Ursinus
their ﬁrst defeat of the season as
well. i

In the Centennial Conference
Championships, Ursinus, who
W&L defeated, took home team
title with 85.5 points and was fol-
lowed by Muhlenberg, another
team the Generals defeated, Johns
Hopkins, and McDaniel, yet an-
other team defeated by the Blue
and White. The Generals ﬁnished
ﬁfth with 48.0 points.

At the conference champion-
ships, the Generals had one run-
ner-up ﬁnish, three third-place
ﬁnishes and one fourth-place ﬁn-

Junior Anthony Boniello ﬁn-
ished as the runner-up in the 165
pound weight class. Boniello
posted a technical fall over Kings
Point’s Trevor Muhler in the ﬁrst
round and prevailed in an 8-3
triumph over Mike Schwager of
Ursinus.

Boniello was then pinned by
Stevens Tech’s Brandon Mac-
Whinnie in the championship
bout. MacWhinnie would go on
to be named Centennial Confer-
ence Wrestler of the Year.

Juniors Jesse Sataloff and Kirk
Adamson and sophomore John

Christopher- (Fort Lauderdale,
Fla./Cardinal Gibbons) all placed
third, while junior David Shubick
took fourth place.

Sataloff, who wrestles in the
174 pound weight class, pinned
Aaron Balk of Gettysburg in the
ﬁrst round, but was pinned by
McDaniel’s Drew Winﬁeld in the
semiﬁnals. Sataloff went on to
capture the their place crown by
defeating Troy McGuinness of
Kings Point, 3-2.

Adamson, who wrestles in the
197 pound weight class, had a
major decision over Ferris Bond
of McDaniel in the ﬁrst round,

but was defeated by Muhlen-
burg’s Matt Loesch in the semiﬁ-
nals. Adamson then proceeded to
thrash Stevens Tech’s James Ro-
aity, 11-4, to ﬁnish third for the
Blue and White.

In the heavyweight divison,
Christopher downed McDaniel’s
Ryan Deiter, 5-2, in the ﬁrst
round, but was then defeated by
Joe Tartar of Muhlenberg. Chris-
topher followed that up with a 4-1
win of Jonathon Freeman of Johns
Hopkins to take the bronze.

Shubick, competing in the 133
pound weight class, was victori-
ous in his ﬁrst round match-up,

pinning Michael Sunmer of Johns
Hopkins in 4:50, but Shubick
went on to be pinned by Ursinus’
Trevor Beard in the semiﬁnal. He
then fell to McDaniel’s Steven
Colasuonno in the third-place
bout.

A young team, the Generals
will only graduate one senior,
making their prospects for next
season great. .

Adamson said, “By having
only one senior on the team, we
are in a great position for next
year. I know everyone wants to
win the conference and won’t be
satisﬁed with anything less.”

Men lose to Va.
Wes. in tourney

Up—and—down season ends for the men when they lose to

By Brlan Devlne
smrr wrmrn

Though this was one of the
best seasons in recent memory,
the Washington and Lee men’s
basketball team has seen rough
times of late.

After a promising start, in-
cluding winning the W&L Invi-
tational in December and a string
of victories against conference
opposition, the team faltered after
losing three straight conference
games by a total of eight points.
These demoralizing defeats at the
end of January and the beginning
of February were but the start of
a nine-game stretch that included
eight conference losses. These
performances dropped the Gen-
erals to 11 wins, 13 losses (6-12
in conference) and placed them
in an unenviable position for the
March ODAC postseason tourna-
ment.

In the tournament, which de-
cides the conference’s automatic
entrant to the NCAA Division
III championships, the Generals
were paired in the quarterﬁnals
with top-seeded Virginia Wesley-
an, the 2006 National Champi-
ons. The Generals had lost to the
Marlins twice during the season,
by 24 points in December and
I2'in February. This time was
no different, as VWC advanced
82-48 on the strength of a 25-4
run in the second half that wid-
ened a gap that was as narrow as
seven points before the halfway

mark. The Marlins forced the
Generals out of their comfortable
half—court oﬁ°ense with a high-
pressure defense. The early lead
and the fast pace set by Wesleyan
made the Generals play catch-up,
a situation that was nigh impos-
sible given the Marlins’ stingy
defense. In the end W&L was
simply outclassed by their oppo-
nents.

The Generals were once again
led by the steady play of junior
forward Greg Bienemann of Cha-
tham, NJ, who ﬁnished the Wes-
leyan game with 1,014 points in
his career. He is the ﬁrst W&L
player to record a four digit ca-
reer total since 1996, and Biene-
mann has another year to add to
his number.

Though Bienemann’s totals
are remarkable, it is unlikely that

he will enter the W&L record V

books for career points as he
would need an additional thou-
sand points to approach the all-
time school record.

Bienemann’s performance
against the Marlins in the quarter-
ﬁnal, held at the Salem Civic Cen-
ter west of Roanoke, was slightly
below his average, a modest 16
points and 13 rebounds, both of
which were highs for the team.
No other player for the Gener-
als reached double ﬁgures in any
category, as Wesleyan showed
why they were ranked second in
the country in Division III and
were the top seed in the confer-
ence tournament. The Marlins

the defending national champions in the ODAC touranment

had four players in double ﬁgures
and held the Generals to their
second-lowest point total of the
season. Wesleyan senior center
Brandon Adair, the ODAC Player
of the Year as a junior, registered
ﬁfteen points and seven rebounds,
while his teammate Ton Ton Ba-
lenga added ﬁfteen and six to his
account.

Adair had totaled 44 points
against the Generals in their pre-
vious two meetings. Wesleyan
would go on to lose the con-
ference semiﬁnal against ﬁfth-
seeded Hampden—Sydney, . the
eventual tournament champions,
but they received an at-large bid
to the NCAA tournament based
on their 23-4 overall record and
should remain highly ranked na-
tionally.

Though the loss is disappoint-
ing for the Generals, even reach-
ing the ODAC tournament was
an improvement on last year. The
11-14 record set by the team this
year is W&L’s best in sixteen
years. Bienemann added to his list
of accomplishments last week, as
well, when he was named to the
all-ODAC ﬁrst team along with
Adair.

Bienemann is the only Gen-
erals player honored by the con-
ference this year. He ﬁnishes the
season with 445 points, an aver-
age of 17.8 points per game, and
leads the team for the season in
points, rebounds, minutes played,
ﬁeld goals, free throws and per-
sonal fouls.

Gir1’s lax already
off to a quick start

After a training trip to Dallas, the women defeated No. 13
St. Mary 3 and then beat Roanoke and Randolph-Macon

By Russweems
STAFF WRITER

The women’s lacrosse team
had a big week, defeating their
ﬁrst two conference opponents.
The Generals look to be one of
the best in the ODAC again. They
won the conference last year and
are working to accomplish that
goal again.

Sophomore Kelsi Robinson
said of the team, “We are so ex-
cited for the season and would

_love to win the ODAC again, but,

as always, we take it one game at
a time and try not to get ahead of
ourselves.”

W&L ﬁelds another strong
team this year with some key up-
perclassmen leaders and some
impressive young talent.

Wednesday the Generals faced
the Roanoke Maroons in their ﬁrst
ODAC game. With three starters
sick, the Generals knew they had
to step it up.

After Roanoke scored the ﬁrst
goal, W&L rolled off ﬁve straight
goals and took a 5-2 lead at half
time. ‘

The second half started slow
as the Maroons cut the lead to 6-
4. The Generals then ratcheted up
the pace to a level the Maroons
could not handle. W&L went on
their second ﬁve goal run of the
game, tallying the ﬁnal ﬁve goals
of the game to secure an 11-4 vic-
tory.

Throughout the contest, the
Generals played solid defense and
connected well in the midﬁeld.
The attackers also had a good

showing. Key individual contri-
butions were made by sophomore
attacker Kelsi Robinson with
two goals and two assists, fresh-
man attacker Britten Matthews
with three goals and sophomore
attacker Katie Flippen with ‘two
scores. Senior midﬁelder Kelly
Evans tallied a goal and an assist
and senior attacker Avery Love-
joy had two assists.

Between the pipes, junior Sar-
ah Tilbor accumulated ﬁve saves,
and sophomore Ali Hillyard also
had a stop. The Generals were
happy to start out their season on
a positive note and look forward
to a strong showing in the ODAC
again this year.

Saturday, fresh off their ﬁrst
conference win, the Generals
went up against ODAC rival,
Randolph-Macon. This is always
a tough, intense game, and W&L
was ready for the challenge.

The Generals started the ﬁrst
half hot, taking a 7-2 advantage at
the break, lead by three of Kelly
Evan ’s game-high four goals. The
team’s strong defense and potent

offense kept the Yellow Jackets
off balance throughout the half.

After the break, the lead got as
low as three goals at 9-6 due to
some “sloppy play,” as one player
put it.

However, the Generals refo-
cused and closed the game strong
to leave with a 13-7 win. Aside
from Evan’s big performance,
Kelsi Robinson also added four
points with three goals and an as-
sist.

Sophomore Colleen Evans

also had a solid showing with.

three points (two goals and an as-
sist). Sarah‘Tilbor and Ali Hilyard
again shared the time in goal with
Tilbor recording four saves, and
Hilyard stopping two.

Next week, the Generals take
on their toughest competition yet
when seventh.-ranked Franklin
and Marshall comes to Lexing-
ton for a non-conference matchup
of two annual powerhouses. The
eleventh ranked Generals are
looking forward to a solid perfor-

mance to prove they deserve to be

a top ten team.

place ﬁnish, to the Gen-
eral’s lone scoring swim-
mer, junior Evan Fitzgerald,
who ﬁnished eighth. Wingate
shocked the Generals in the
800 Free Relay, out-touching
the team of Brett Tatman, Alex
Sweet, Brandon Bamds and
Paul Crook by nine-tenths of a
second to give Wingate a six
point advantage going into the
ﬁnal day of competition.

“We were a little shocked
to be losing,” said Paul Crook.
“Wingatebrought in an incred-
ibly strong freshmen class,
which made the meet much
closer this year.”

The ﬁnal day’s ﬁrst event
was the 1650 Free. Even
though Wingate’s Matthew
Dugan won the event, Fresh-
men Jonathan Giesen and Dan
Austin had excellent swims,
taking second and fourth for
W&L. Mike Ginder captured
the 100 backstroke title in
the next event, out-touching
Wingate’s Brian Parks by six
tenths of a second to ﬁnish in
1:49.94.

“Mental toughness was the
key to success on the ﬁnal day.
We didn’t let the fact that we
were losing get to us. Instead,
we used it as motivation to
swim even faster,” said Paul
Crook. “Plus, when you have
20 of your teammates going
and cheering hard for every
race on the pool deck, it’s hard

Men's Swimming:

not to go fast.”

The Championship Heat of
the 100 Free was one of the
most important swims of the
meet.

“The 100 free was an
intense race,” said David
Croushore. “Before the race
in the ready room, not a word
was spoken, as four Generals,
three Wingate Bulldogs, and
one third party understood the
signiﬁcance of that race.”

Even though Sweet broke
the school record and quali-
ﬁed for nationals, ﬁnishing in
45.40, he came up short of the
title as Wingate’s Gus Chagas
won the race. However, the
Generals took fourth, ﬁfth, and
sixth, giving them the higher
point total for the event.

“The key races were any
race where we went up against
a Wingate guy,” Sweet said.
“We always had to make sure
that we beat them out in the
morning to get into ﬁnals and
then swim well at night to beat
them again.”

Wingate wasn’t ﬁnished
yet. In the 200 Breaststroke,
Sergey Vlashchenko and Kyle
Corcoran ﬁnish ﬁrst and sec-
ond to keep them in the meet.

In the 200 Fly, the fresh-
man duo of Winston Stagg and
Josh Gonzalez ﬁnished third
and fourth. Evan Fitzgerald,
having already swam the 200
Backstroke earlier in the eve-
ning, out-touched Wingate’s
Carlos Jones for 13”‘ place.

Team is looking forward
to rematch with Hopkins

One of the differences in
the meet was “having Evan
swimming up in the 200 back
and 200 ﬂy on the same day,”
said Tim McGlaston.

“Winston Stagg and Josh
Gonzalez’s swims at the end
of the last day was vital,” said
Alex Sweet. “They both beat
two Wingate swimmers
which secured us a victory in
the meet.”

In the competition’s ﬁ-
nal event, the 400 Freestyle
Relay, W&L’s foursome of
Sweet, Tim McGlaston, David
Croushore, and Mike Ginder
sealed the team victory by
winning in a provisional cut
time of 3:04.49, good enough
for a school and meet record.
The win gave the Generals a
total of 755 points to Wing-
ate’s 733.

At the conclusion of the
meet, seven Generals had
qualiﬁed for nationals, giving
them a chance at the school’s
ﬁrst top-ﬁve ﬁnish.

Nationals will be
March 15-17 in Houston.

“Our goal for nationals is
to swim fast, bottom line. Last
year we were just happy to go,
this year we have determina-
tion to become a dominant

held

- swimming threat year in and

year out at nationals,” said
Alex Sweet. “Every race is
key, and if we can bring back
one or more relay or individ-
ual national championships,
that would be great too.”

THE RING-TUM PHI ' 9

Baseball kicks off season in winning fashion

The men’s baseball team has been off to a great start in their 2007 campaign. Senior Clayton Edwards
pitched a complete-game shutout and went 3-for-5 with two RBls as the Generals swept a doubleheader
rom Emory & Henry. The Generals took the first game, 6-0 and then won the second contest 16-14. In the
ﬂrst game, W&L was led by junior James Madden, who went 1-for-4 with two RBI and the homerun, and
junior Tlm Llvlngston, who hit 2-for-3 with one RBI. Edwards hurled all seven Innings in the first game of
the doubleheader, racking up 11 strikeouts and only four hits and three walks.

Laxers off to slow start

Men come up short against second ranked Gettysburg on Saturday

By Madeline Gent
surr wnmzn

Eugene McCabe’s ﬂrst win
as head coach of the Washington
and Lee men’s lacrosse team was
bittersweet, as it was sandwiched
between two rough losses for the
Generals.

Washington and Lee opened
its season ranked sixteen in the
preseason polls but fell out of the
top twenty alter suffering a 6-5
defeat at the hands of Cabrini.

The Generals entered halftime

with a lead but were held score— _

less in the second half. A strong
defense was not enough to stop
the 20"‘ ranked Cavaliers, who
scored two goals in the third and

\ fourth quarters.

“We were upset about the way
we played because we couldn’t
do anything offensively, which
was tough,” said junior attacker
Ned Rider.

McCabe recorded his ﬂrst win
as a head coach of the Generals
with a 9-3 victory over visiting
York College this past Wednes-
day.

The Generals dominated the
ﬁrst half, holding York to only
one goal while scoring eight of
their own. The second half saw
the Generals battling.

“They played a zone 85 per-
cent of the game. We struggled to
get into rhythm,” noted McCabe.

The Generals are still look to
bring their offense up to a more
consistent level after they only
managed two goals in the second
half against York.

With a young offense ﬁghting
to put an entire game together, a
positive light shone in the form
of junior long—stick defenseman
Spotty Robins.

Fellow teammate Rider said,
“Spotty is playing really well.
He is really consistent more than
anyone on the team... He’s been
playing awesome and I would

say he is the best long pole in the
league.”

Robins notched his ﬁrst goal
of the season against Cabrini.
“Spotty played a great defense,
scored a goal, and overall really
stepped up his game,” said Me-
Cabe.

Also on defense, senior goalie
Chris Lalli recorded 14 saves
against the York offense. “We
came out on a Wednesday and
played hard... We were up 8-1
at halftime, and it was tough for
them to come back from a deﬁcit
when Lalli is playing so well,”
noted senior defenseman and cap-
tain Peter Goodwin. “It was good
to get coach his ﬁrst win.”

On Saturday, W&L hosted
number two ranked Gettysburg.
Again struggling to put a full
game together, the Generals lost
sight of a victory in the ﬂrst half
and went into halftime with an
eight goal deﬁcit. “Offensively
we need to mature and grow a
little,” said McCabe. “It was an
average performance.”

The Generals’ average perfor-
mance was no match for the ﬁrst
half speed of the Bullets. Taking
the opportunities when available,
Gettysburg converted numerous
strong defensive plays into offen-
sive hustle.

“We let them get goals early
and we couldn’t really recover,”
noted Goodwin. “We had a good
game plan which we executed in
the second half. We let them get
some transition goals in the ﬂrst
half which was something we
wanted to stop. It’s tough to go
into halftime at 9-1.”

The Generals did not score un-
til the Bullets gained a 5-0 lead.
Sophomore attacker Harry St.
John had the ﬁrst goal with 7:54
left to play in the first half of the
game. “The bulk of our leader-
ship is on defense,” said McCabe,
referring to his thirteen returning
seniors, “We have strong recruit-

We came out on a Wednesday and played

hard... We were up 8-1 at halftime, and it was

tough for them to come back from a deﬁcit

when Lalli is playing so well.

PETER GOODWIN, senlor captaln
 

ing classes and these young gmys
just need to step it up.”

The second half saw a drastic
change in the play of the Gener-
als. They kept up with their op-
ponents, picking up their game
both offensively and defensively.
Only outscored by one goal in
the second period, the Generals’
younger offense showed great
potential. “We played a lot bet-
ter in the second half. We moved
the ball better, we picked it up and
the ball feeding improved,” said
Rider. “We realized we could play
with them the second half, but it
was too late.”

“We have a lot of young guys
so we just need to learn from it.
We got better yesterday, and we
have a good opportunity to go
forward this coming weekend
against Washington College,”
said Goodwin.

When asked what was next for
the blue and white, McCabe was
on the same page as his captain.
“We are going to prepare for next
week and get better for Washing-
ton College.” The Generals look
to improve their record and get
another win for the new coach this
Saturday, March 10 in a 7:00 p.m.
game at Washington College.

The reason
why people

are SO

much

taller today

The actual reason for increase in average
height in America can be blamed on ballers

By Adam Lewis and Russ
Weems
snrr wnnrns

Since 1960, the average height
of a United States citizen between
the ages of 20 and 74 has risen
over an inch to approximately
69.4 inches, according to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human
Services.

And the increase in the heights
of children is even more signiﬁ-
cant. Now, it may seem like this
change is due to improvements
in diets, technology, lifestyles,
medicine, etc.

But what if we were to tell
you that I knew the exact cause of
this, and ﬁirther, that diets, life-
styles, and medicine are merely
cover-ups for the real scapegoat:
the NBA?

Founded in 1946, the National
Basketball Association has boast-
ed the world’s most talented, rich-
est, and yes, tallest athletes ever.

But what sometimes gets swept
under the rug is that these athletes
are also some of the planet’s most
sexually active human beings.

Combine that with the fact that
they are extremely tall, and there
is my reasoning why the change
in human height is due strictly to
the NBA.

Having said this, let’s take
some actual statistics into ac-
count.

In his autobiography, Wilt
Chamberlin claimed to have slept
with 20,000 women, and we will
assume that he abided by the
Washington and Lee Honor Sys-
tem when he stated this.

Clearly, because “Wilt the
Stilt” is regarded as one of the
best players of all-time, he prob-
ably did better with the ladies
than the majority of other athletes
in his sport.

I mean, let’s face it, the nick-
name “Wilt the Stilt” could only
mean one thing.

Given this, let’s assume that
other NBA players only sleep
with an average of 5,000 women,
a generously low estimate con-
sidering it is merely a quarter of
Chamberlin’s count.

While he was indeed superior
to almost all athletes in the league,
it is obvious that with new training
and technology, modem-day pro-
fessional basketball players have
greater than 25% of Chamberlin’s
athletic ability.

And moreover, with all the
new pick—up lines, online servic-
es, and brands of alcohol, these
players are probably not much
worse in the seduction realm than
Wilt was.

However in spite of this, we
will keep this minute number of
5,000, giving “the Stilt” some
well-eamed respect.

As of 2001, 51 out of every
1,000 women experienced an
unintended pregnancy according
to “Perspectives on Sexual and
Reproductive Health.” That is
an unplanned pregnancy rate of
roughly 5%. » ~

A Now, if we stick with the esti-
mated number of women that the
average NBA athlete fomicates
with, it would hold that there are
approximately 250 children cre-
ated per NBA player.

And this is assuming that none
of these players throw a “pimp
game” that is at all comparable to
that of “Wilt the Stilt.”

Moving on, there are 450 pro-
fessional basketball players cur-
rently in the NBA.

With the mean rate of procre-
ation amongst these athletes of
250 children per, the total number
of olfspring produced by current
NBA-ers would be 112,500.

Yes, that is quite a number,
but it is clearly based on factual
proof so there should be no dis-
crepancy.

In conclusion, I think I have
made it pretty evident that chang-
es in food, lifestyle, and medicine
have little if any impact on the
overall increase in height.

It is obvious that the mem-
bers of the NBA are responsible,
whose abhorrently pimpish life-
styles have accounted for over
100,000 children, all of whom are
(and will be) signiﬁcantly taller.

Wait a second. Oh my God. I
am 6’2”. Does that mean my dad
is Shawn Bradley?

Men take down rival

Men is tennis opens spring season with victories over three ODA C squads and rival, Sewanee

ByMlke Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

Aﬁer a road trip around the
southeastern part of America
that resulted in utter domina-

» tion over an ODAC opponent, a

close contest with a Division I
foe,and a solid win against a pc-
rennial rival, the Washington and
Lee men’s tennis team is off to a
great start to its 2007 campaign.

This past week, the Generals
took on ODAC opponent Lynch-
burg College and local opponent
Ferrum College, a team that the
Generals had never played.

W&L dominated both con-
tests, failing to lose a single match
against either opponent.

Against Lynchburg, junior
Seth Feibelman was victorious
at ﬁrst singles, while junior Nat
Estes won at second singles. Both
Feibelman and Estes won 6-1, 6-
O.

Sophomore Jamie McCardell
was victorious at third singles,
and senior Andrew Ellison won
fourth singles.

Freshmen Cliff Gaddy and
Parker Swenson saw action for the
Generals at ﬁﬁh and sixth singles
respectively for the Generals.

Both won in straight sets. The
Generals also swept doubles ac-
tion as F eibelrnan paired with Es-
tes for an 8-1 .victory, while Mc-
Cardell paired with senior captain
Jon Malooly for an 8-2 victory at
second doubles.

Freshman Alex Brooke paired
with Ellison for an 8-2 victory at
third doubles for the Generals.

The match against Ferrum saw
junior Tim Ross win at ﬁrst sin-
gles for the Generals, 6-0, 6-4.

Feibelman and Estes won at
second and third singles for the
Generals, dominating their op-
ponents.

Malooly and McCardell were
victorious at fourth and ﬁﬁh sin-
gles respectively. Malooly did not
lose a single game.

Junior Stuart Sanford was
victorious at sixth singles for the
Generals posting a 6-0, 6-0 vic-
tory.

The Generals’ biggest victory
of the season came over Feb Break
when the team traveled to Tennes-
see to take on Sewanee, winning
by the close score of 6-3.

Ross had to play three sets in
order to defeat Charlie Boyd in
ﬁrst singles, 5-7, 6-0, 6-4.

Feibelman and Estes captured
second and third singles in straight
sets. Malooly was also victorious
at fourth singles for the Generals
winning 6-2, 6-3.

In doubles action, Ross and
Estes paired up to win ﬁrst dou-
bles 8-4, while Malooly and Mc-
Cardell teamed up to win second
doubles 8-2.

It has been a very strong start
to the season for the Generals.

Malooly said, “The team has
improved dramatically since we
started practicing a few weeks
ago, and it showed in our con-
vincing win over Sewanee.”'

For a team to be successful on
the courts, it takes many different
elements. First the team must have
a certain degree of chemistry.

Malooly said, “I think there
is good team chemistry this year,
which has made our team stron-
ger. The whole team is moti-
vated to practice hard and try to
improve. Good communication

I think there is good team chemistry this

year, which has made our team stronger.

The whole team is motivated to practice

hard and try to improve.

JON MALOOLY. senlor captaln

between the players and coach
Detwiler have allowed for quality
practices where everyone can get
better.”

Experience is another element
important for success. The Gener-
al-s are a very young team, but at
the same time, each of their top
players had a tremendous amount
of match experience.

Estes said, “Our strengths
deﬁnitely include our experience,
since many of the players have
match experience, including ﬁve
or so juniors and a senior recover-
ing from surgery.”

A ﬁnal strength for the Gener-
als comes in the form of depth.
Having a talented squad allows
for a multitude of different play-
ers to be able to compete on any
given day.

Junior Nelson Bunn said, “We
have solid guys all the way down
the lineup. I feel that any of us
could challenge one another on
the court at any given time. An-
other strength this year is team
bonding. The February Break trip
[across the southeast] united us as
a team.”

This season has brought a few
changes to the Generals.

Fundamentally, scoring will
not be conducted differently, with

doubles matches now counting
for three points total, rather than
only one point being contended in
the doubles matches.

Malooly said, “The ultimate
goal is to improve our games and
advance past the second round
of the NCAA tournament, where
we have lost for the past several
years.”

A ﬁnal change that the team
has witnessed is an additional
strength within the region as evi-
denced through the fall season.

Estes said, “I would say that
the impression that we got from
our fall season was that the oth-
er teams in our region got much
stronger this year, and that we
should have plenty of tough
matches this year.”

However, given the success
of the season so far this year, the
Generals‘ will be up-to the task
against any opponent.

Malooly said, “The team
played very well in [their match-
es] and was ready to compete. Ev-
eryone was very focused on their
matches and we were able to pull
out a victory.”

The Generals will return to ac-
tion on Tuesday when they travel
to Randolph-Macon to face their
ODAC foe.

Streak snapped by Macon

Women ’s swimming sees thirteen-year winning streak snapped by six points at the hands of Randolph-Macon

By Michael Keenan
su rr wn lTE a

Washington and Lee’s wom-
en’s swim team’s quest to win a
fourteenth straight ODAC cham-
pionship came up just six points
short as Randolph-Macon Col-
lege won their ﬁrst ODAC title
since ﬁrst ﬁelding a team in the
1999-2000 season.

The Generals knew they would
have a stiff challenge in their title
defense from the start.

Earlier in the season, the Gen-
erals had lost a dual meet at home
to Randolph-Macon, 135-126,
making for a charged atmosphere
at Radford.

“The atmosphere at the meet
was incredible, especially at ﬁ-
nals. In every heat, there were
Randolph-Macon swimmers and
Washington and Lee swimmers,
and you knew just how badly
each team wanted their teammate
to get their hand on the wall ﬁrst,”
said Miata.

“Cheering and celebrating
came from both teams, including
the coaches, swimmers and even
the parents. Everyone was really
into it,” Miata continued.

The Generals got off to a strong
start on Friday evening as the 200
free relay team of freshman Jenna
Worsham, junior Amy Rober-
son, sophomore Julia Miata, and
freshman Sarah Simpson ﬁnished
ﬁrst.- Sophomores Jessica Shaw
and Lindsey Strachan followed

up with fourth and ﬁfth place ﬁn-
ishes in the 500 freestyle.

“Key races were at the begin-
ning of the meet,” said Miata.
“Swimming well in the beginning
was important, because it showed
us that all the training and taper-
ing had more than prepared us to
swim well for the entire week-
end.”

In the 200 individual med-
ley, Sophomore Susan Mahoney,
Worsham, Miata, and Senior cap-
tain Abbie Sauter ﬁnished in the
top six.

Though day one ended on a
disappointing note as the Yellow
Jackets won the 400 Medley Re-
lay, the Generals still held a 188-
147 advantage. It was clear this
would be a two team meet as the
other four teams combined had
amassed only 192 total points.

“It was always between us and

. Randolph-Macon for ﬁrst place,

so the energy on deck was unbe-
lievable,” said Miata.

The Generals started out day
two equally strong. The foursome
of Strachan, Mahoney, Amy Rob-
erson, and Worsham out-touched
Randolph-Macon in the 200 Med-
ley Relay by less than six tenths

“The 200 medley was really
a blast going into the ﬁnals: we

pected to stay in that position,”
said Worsham.

how tough we really are. It caught
them off-guard and was an excit-
ing race up to the very last sec-
ond” Worsham contined.

In the next event, the 400 Indi-
vidual Medley, Shaw, Mahoney,
and Miata took ﬁrst, second, and
third. Shaw’s time of 4:43.78 just
missed setting a school record.

However, Randolph-Macon
kept it close by ﬁnished fourth,
ﬁfth, and sixth, and put six in the
top ten, including Shafer Busch’s
victory, in the next event the 100
ﬂy.

In the ﬁnal event of day two,
the 800 free relay, the Yellow
Jackets bested the Generals relay
of Worsham, Strachan, Mahoney,
and Simpson by just over three
seconds, cutting the General’s
lead to ten heading into the ﬁnal
day of competition.

Though Strachan won the 200
backstroke to start the ﬁnal day,
Randolph-Macon took second,
third, fourth, seventh and eighth.

In the 100 free, the Generals
were led by Jenna Worsham’s
55.94 and took third through

sixth places. Shaw placed second
and Sauter, in her ﬁnal collegiate
event, took third for the Generals
in the 200 breaststroke.

Though Miata won the 100
Fly in a time of2: 17.30, with only
one event remaining the General
were too far behind to stage a last-
event comeback.

“The 400 freestyle relay was
memorable,” said Worsham. “Go-
ing into it, some of us knew we
had already lost even if we did
win the relay and this is when it
began to sit in with me that the
streak was over. But we weren’t
thinking about that.”

Worsham continued, “It was
just another race for us, so we
gave it everything we had left,
which turned out to be a lot more
than they had left.

“We had been yelling our guts
out all weekend cheering, and
I’ve never‘heard the team yell
that loud before” Worsham con-
tinued.

The yelling worked as the
foursome of Worsham, Mahoney,
Simpson and Strachan took

ﬁrst place, ﬁnishing in a time of
3:44.20.

“I think that this victory made
the following 20 minutes of ac-
cepting defeat more bearable for
us all,” said Worsham.

“We won the event for the ﬁ-
nal relay and ﬁnal event of the
meet, the 400 free relay. But even
after the Randolph-Macon team
touched the wall, that side of the
pool began cheering. Right then,
I knew who had truly won the
meet,” said Miata. “Losing by
six points is nothing at a swim
meet; it’s the difference between
a swimmer moving up two places,
or a relay moving up one place.
It was so hard to accept that the
winning streak had ended. It just
didn’t seem real at ﬁrst.”

At the end of the meet, Ran-
dolph-Macon had amassed 609
points to the General’s 603.

“I think the team is satisﬁed
with their performance. A lot of
people seem to focus on the fact
that we broke a 13-year win-
ning streak, but that does not do
justice to every girl’s individual
performances. So many people
had life time bests, moved up in
place during ﬁnals or just had
unbelievably strong and impres-
sive races,” said Miata. “So indi-
vidually, we did some incredible
things, and as a team, we realize
that having four less people to
score points automatically puts
us at a disadvantage. We fought
hard, and although we didn’t walk

away with the gold, we swam the
best we could.”

“We are content with our own
performance as a team. I mean,
we out-swam Randolph Macon,
out-fought them, and out-cheered
them. In every way a team can
be better-we were the best.” said
Worsham. “And that’s what mat-
ters when you get to the core of it.
But in the end, it was a game of
numbers, and they had the upper-
hand in that case.”

The Generals are only losing
one senior to graduation and are
looking to start a new streak next
year

“We are more than prepared
to start a new winning streak next
year. Not only has this meet made
us realize that someone is always
going to come after us, but it also
made us angry, said Miata. “The
tension between the rivalry has
escalated so much within the past
year, and we want Randolph-Ma-
con to know that we are not go-
ing to go down without a ﬁght.
Reclaiming the ODAC title will
probably be the most important
goal for us as a team next year,
and there’s no doubt in my mind
that we will put Randy-Mac back
in their place.

Miata continued, “It’s good
that they have a brief feeling of
victory, and I hope they remember
it for a long time, because they’re
not going to get it back again for a
while. We’ll be ready to dominate
next year.”

THE RING-TUM PHI ' 11

  Va. Wes. finishes
   women’s season

Team ﬁnishes with 1 6-1] record while senior
Jessica Hunsinger sets ODAC rebound record

By Kevin Trempe
STAFF WRITER

Taking advantage of veteran
leadership and dominating front
court play, the Washington and
Lee women’s basketball team
capped off a record-breaking sea-
son last week.

Although the 2006-07 cam-
paign ended with a disappointing
loss to Virginia Wesleyan in the
second round of the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference Champi-
onship, no one will argue that the
season was one of the best in the
program’s short history. '

Coming into the season, few
outside the W&L locker room ex-
pected the program to enjoy the
success it did. The team lost three
seniors from a 2005-06 squad that
went 11-15, and W&L had not
won an ODAC tournament game
since 1999.

However, the Generals were
able to return some key players,
namely senior center Jessica Hun-
singer and junior guard Kristen
Krouchick.

Through their contributions
and the addition of a strong fresh-
man class, the Generals began the
season well, winning the Swarth-
more Tip-oﬂ‘ tournament on the
way to a 3-1 record out of the
gate. Although a six-game los-

ing streak during conference play
put the Generals’ hopes of reach-
ing the conference tournament in
jeopardy, the team responded by
winning 12 out of their ﬁnal 15
regular season games.

That streak included an histor-
ic ﬁrst for W&L, as they knocked

off 24th-ranked Bridgewater’

on Jan. 20, the ﬁrst win over a
ranked opponent in the program’s
history. In the ﬁrst round of the
ODAC Tournament, the Generals
drew Eastern Mennonite Univer-
sity, a team that had dealt W&L
two losses earlier in the season.

Behind 16 points and a sea-
son—high 12 rebounds by junior
forward Haley James, the Gener-
als ﬁnally bested EMU when it
mattered the most, taking a 53-
43 victory over the third-seeded
Royals.

The thrill of the victory was
short-lived, however, as W&L
lost in the second round to Virgin-
ia Wesleyan by a score of 73-62.

Hunsinger scored 12 points

and grabbed nine rebounds in

what would be her ﬁnal game,

and Krouchick red the Gene'ra‘ls.«-T

with 14 points.

Despite the disappointing ﬁn-
ish, one cannot overlook the re-
cord-setting season that preceded
it. W&L ﬁnished at 16-11, the
best record in program history.

Other records broken include
most points in a game (with a
90-26 victory over Hollins) and
longest winning streak (seven
games).

Krouchick led the team in
scoring with 13.2 points per game
and added 6.8 boards a game.

With 99 blocked shots this
season, Jessica Hunsinger shat-
tered W&L season and career re-
cords for blocks, and ﬁnished the
season as the ﬁfth most proliﬁc
shot-blocker in Division III. She
averaged 3.7 blocks per game.

Hunsinger ﬁnished just shy of
averaging a double-double as she
scored 12.5 points per game and
hauled in an average of 9.9 re-
bounds each contest.

Hunsinger also became the
ﬁrst General to reach 1,000 career
rebounds, and her 1,046 career
boards set an Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference record. For their
efforts, Krouchick and Hunsinger
were named to the All-ODAC
Second Team.

singer’s presence on the post.

Rowing team is back on the Water

After a 54 year layoff junior Parker Sheppard is working to restart the school is oldest club sport

By Mike Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

ashington and Lee’s
oldest club sport has
found new life on cam-

pus, as the W&L Rowing Club is
beginning practices for the ﬁrst
time in over half a century.

Junior Parker Sheppard started
his quest to reinstate the club dur-
ing his freshman year.

“The club really got off the
ground last year when we got
money from the EC, which we
used to purchase a four-man shell,
four oars, and a combination
truck/trailer to carry the shells.”

Unfortunately, the equipment
didn’t come together in time to
start practicing and competing
last year, but this year, the team
has begun practicing.

After two practices in the fall,
the team has already has been
regularly practicing so far this

spring. The team will do its on
the water training at Lake Mer-
riweather, which is located near
Goshen. The lake is owned by
a local Boy Scout camp, but the
team has secured permission to
use their on site lake.

The ﬁrst rowing club founded
on campus was the ‘Albert Sid-
ney Rowing Club, named for the
Civil War General Albert Sidney
Johnston. The Harry Lee Row-
ing Club, named for “Light Horse
Harry” Lee, a Revolutionary War
general who was also Robert E.
Lee’s father, was another club
founded shortly thereafter. The
ﬁrst race between the two clubs
was in 1874.

The annual race held the week
before ﬁnals was one of the big-
gest events of the year. On the day
of the race, houses in Lexington
would display blue and red ﬂags,
the colors of the respective clubs,
and the spectators would drink

“I ’m really happy with getting people on the wa-

ter and getting people experience. I want to let

them see what its like to be in a competition. ’

PARKER SHEPPARD, Rowing Club president
 

blue and red lemonade at the race.
Members of the clubs would com-
pete to paint the statue of George
Washington atop of Washington
Hall either blue or red. I
The last race between the
two clubs was in 1953. Some-
time thereaﬁer, an irate ﬁsherman
broke into the boathouse and de-
stroyed the teams’ shells with a
shotgun. A few students tried to
revive the Rowing Club in 1988,
but it never got off the ground.
The team is made up'of 20
students, both men and women
alike. Though the team only had
two practices together in the fall,

Sheppard competed in the Novice
Men’s Single Scull at the Head of
the Potomac, placing second and
won the same event at the Chatta-
nooga Head Race, defeating oars-
men from Tulane and Georgia
Tech.

Sheppard started sculling
— rowing with two oars, one in
each hand — this summer while in
Lexington. The club competes in
sweep boats, in which each rower
has only one oar.

As practices continue, the
team plans to go to the Occoquan
Sprints in Lorton, Va. on April 1.

Sheppard has many goals as

the season continues. “This year
I’m really happy with- getting
people on the water and getting
people experience. I want to let
them see what it’s like to be in a
competition.”

Sheppard’s largest goal is to
bring back the Albert Sidney-Har-
ry Lee race, which has historical
signiﬁcance on campus. “When I
came as a freshman, I visited the
summer before freshmen year to
look for possible rowing places.
I did research on the past teams
and found out about the Albert
Sidney-Harry Lee race, and it’s
something that I’ve wanted to get
started ever since then.”

Rowing Club Vice President
Julie Mancini has always been an
oarswoman.

“l was on crew in high school,
and I love the sport. Not being
‘able to row on an already estab-
lished teams was one of the sac-
riﬁces I made in coming to W&L,

but I think it’s going to be just as

rewarding in helping bring back

crew here,” she said.

Sheppard is also in contact "

with Stewart Bracken ’54, an

alumnus who’s trying to garner .

support from oarsmen that com-
peted in the Generals last season
in 1953. Roger Mudd ’50 and
Robert Huntley ‘50, former Presi-
dent of W&L and namesake of
the Commerce School, competed
for the Generals in the 1950s.
Mancini also has her own set
of goals for the Generals: “This
season, we just want to make sure
that everyone gets a taste of what
crew is all about, which isn’t just
an erg machine facing a wall in
the gym. Everyone should get
a chance to get out on the water
within the coming weeks, and
we’ll get some practices in. We’d
like to get everyone comfortable
enough on the water to actually
go to a regatta later this spring.”

Washington and Lee’s men’s
swim team overcame a ﬁve point
deﬁcit to Wingate University
on the ﬁnal day of the three day
competition to claim the Blue-
grass Mountain Conference title.
The meet was not expected to be
this competitive, especially with
Wingate since Wingate’s men’s
team is only a year old.

“We knew that Wingate would
offer some good competition and
we were conﬁdent that we had
what it took to win, but we did not
expect to trail after day two,” said
Senior David Croushore.

“We thought it would be
competitive, but Wingate really
stepped up and swam very well,”
said Junior Alex Sweet. “They
had a couple foreign guys who
they gave scholarships to and had
just become eligible, so we didn’t
know what to expect from them.”

The Generals got off to a
strong start on the ﬁrst day of
competition. In the ﬁrst event of
Thursday evening, the foursome

his school record-setting prelim

Women start strong

Women is tennis team opens with two big victories over ODAC foes

By Mike Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

To play two tennis matches
in the same day for any intercol-
legiate team is ,a staggering chal-
lenge. Even more so, to play two
tennis matches at the same time
in different locations would seem
to be impossible. However, the
Washington and Lee women’s
tennis team is clearly an excep-
tion to this rule due to their ex-
treme depth and uncanny ability.

The Generals opened their
season this past Wednesday fac-
ing conference foes Hollins and
Lynchburg. The Generals took on
Hollins at home on their indoor
courts at the Duchusois Tennis
Center, while the other half of
the team traveled to Lynchburg to
take on their ODAC opponent.

The most staggering statistic
is that over the course of the 18
matches played on Wednesday,
the Generals only lost 17 games.

The Generals, who made it all

the way to the NCAA Division III
team championship game, before
falling to archrival Emory, clearly
have revenge on their mind as
their season begins.

Sophomore Tori Christmas
said, “We really really want na-
tionals bad. We pretty much have
the same team as last year, with a
few strong additions like Lauren
Caire and Katie Bouret, and with
many seniors in the starting line
up, this is the year to do it. It was
hard beating Emory in the regu-
lar season on Easter last year and
then losing to them in the ﬁnals
of nationals. We are deﬁnitely out
for revenge.”

In the match against, Hollins,
the Generals dominated, losing
only two games in singles com-
petition, and surrendering only
four games in doubles action.
The Generals were led by sopho-
more Katie Tabb, who played ﬁrst
singles and was victorious 6-1,
6-0. Senior Ginny Wortham was
dominant at second singles for the

Juniors Leah Weston and Re-

fashion. Weston dropped only
one game in the second set, while
Timmis blanked her opponent 6-

Two freshmen got their ﬁrst

out the singles line up for the

rious at ﬁrst singles 6-1, 6-1, and

torious as third and fourth singles
