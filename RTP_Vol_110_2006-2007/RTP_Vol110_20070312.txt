Students and alums crowded
onto the Cadaver Bridge at 10:30
p.m. in elegant ball gowns and
colorful masks. A few minutes
later, the crowd enjoyed an ex-
citing ﬁreworks display as bright
reds arrd greens lit up the sky.

After the show, couples trailed
back inside under black canopies
to enjoy live music from the Pat
Patrick Band and snazzy jams
from I)J Dwayne.

“We wanted the party to re-
semble Fancy Dress balls of the
past, but we also wanted to incor-
porate some ‘surprises’ that will
make this FD truly ‘The Party of
the Century, ’” decoration co-chair
Sarah Helms said.

"We are very proud ol‘the dec-
orations for this year.“ senior co-
chair Niki Tsiknakis said. "They
are impressi\'e. while staying
minimal and avoiding the tacky
look that dominated l’ancy Dress
in years,past."'

This l00"‘ anni\'ersary of Fan-
cy Dress at Waslrirrgtorr and Lee
University catered to every gener-
ation and style. This year's theme
was a black and wlrite masquer-
ade ball. The theme was decided
by the l’anc_v I)ress committee in
the fall.

“We wanted the 100"‘ anrriver-
sary of Fancy Dress to take cen-

a

ter stage, not the theme choice,’
Tsiknakjs said. “Black and white
balls are extremely classic events,
and we were inspired speciﬁcally
by Truman Capote’s black and
white masquerade ball held in
1963 at the Plaza Hotel.”

Tsiknakis also said the mas-
querade theme was chosen to
honor the very first Fancy Dress
in 1907, which was a masquerade
ball.

This year, according to senior
co-chair Lily De Grazia, the Fan-

lcy Dress Committee was given

a budget of $90,000. She said
$4,000 came from the Execu-
tive Committee, and the rest was
earned from ticket sales.

Sticking to the theme of

. EC may soon hold assault hearings

President-elect Josh Payne says EC will issue statement explaining new policies

By Wes 0’Dell
STAFF WRITER

“First and foremost, I’m a
W&L student," says the new
Presiderrt-Elect of the Execu-
tive Committee, Joshua Payne.
“Someone who considers W&L a
second alma mater and someone
who believes strongly enough in
the ideals ofthis place to serve on
the EC for two years."

But ask most students, and
you ﬁnd they recognize Payne — a
second year law student — mostly
ﬁ‘om his campaign posters that
have appeared around campus
over the last few days. And that’s
one of several things he aims to
change.

Both he and fellow law stu-
dent Jane I/edlie, the newly-elect-
ed EC secretary, ran on platforms
of increased conrmunication with
the student body and proactive
EC action to identify and address
student concerns.

Ledlie said. “It always feels
like student leaders are every-
where during election time,
so why not do the sa.rne thing
throughout the year? I want the
student body to really know the
EC members, and I want us to re-
ally know them."

Payne’s solution lies largely in
his proposed Presidents Council
of Student Leaders. an advisory
body that would regularly meet
with the EC to advise it on “what
students care about" so that the
EC can better serve as an “elfee-
tive advocate for students."

According to Payne. the PCSL

will help the EC “do its job as the
student government. . .doir1g more
than just funding orgarrizatiorrs--~
helping support them throughout
the year as well.”

Another major issue this year
was what role the EC should play
in cases of sexual assault.

Junior Representative Marga-
ret Elkjns ﬁrst raised the issue in
her campaign: “It most deﬁnitely
is a breach of the community‘s
trust,” she said. “We can‘t codify
the honor system, but ifsorneone
wanted to bring it before us. . .I‘d
be more than happy to hear that."

“When I talked about it the
feedback I received was very pos-
itive,” she said. However. she did
not make it the central issue ofher
campaign.

Payne also campaigned on the

issue prior to Wednesday's rurroll‘

elections. In an interview with the
Phi, he announced publicly for
the ﬁrst time that he had drafted a

‘‘[Sexual assault] most definitely is a breach of

the community is trust... if someone wanted to

bring it before us... I ’d be more than happy to

hear that. ”

Margaret Elkins, EC Secretary

 

statcrnent for the EC condemning
sexual assaultsas “discordant with
the principles of honor at W&L.”

'lhe statement would explicitly
state for the ﬁrst time the right of
victims ofsexual assault to allege
an honor violation in front of the
EC: "the victim is free, as anyone
is...to come to us and allege an
honor violaiiorrf’ he said.

He is quick to note, though,
that “the EC is incapable of com-
ing forward and saying that some-
thing is an honor violation before
a hearing.“’ as the EC must con-
sider each individual case in light
of what the “current generation”
considers an HV.

"However. we go on to note
that the SFHB isa specially-cre-
ated forurir for sexual assault...
issues and that the victim may

feel more comfortable going to
the SFHB,” Payne said.

The SFHB (Student-Faculty
Hearing Board) was created in
the early 1990s to handle sexual
assault and discrimination cases.

“That statement will be com-
ing out in a few weeks,” Payne
said.

In other EC news, Jordan
Campbell was elected EC Vice-
President without any opposi-
tion. He declined to comment to
the Phi. Additionally, the students
approved an amendment to the
Student Body Constitution that
would move the budget alloca-
tion process from September to
the spring.

Students also elected a new
Student Judicial Council Presi-
dent, Junior Shane Wilson. Wil-

son plans to “work with other
campus leaders to promote stu-
dent self-govemance, raise the
credibility of the SJC among all
community members, and proac-
tively seek to reduce the number
of students who face disciplinary
action at W&L.”

He stated that his efforts to
improve transparency and corri-
munication will include increased
training for SJC members. greater
outreach to the Lexington city
government and public infomra-
tion campaigns to educate stu-
dents.

Sophomore Riley Barnes, the
newly-elected SJC Secretary, said
that improving communication is
vital: “There was a lot of miscom-
munication between the students
and the SJC this last year, espe-
cially with regard to Dean Dot-
son.”

Associate Dean of Students
Brandon Dotson was recently
appointed SJC advisor, spark-
ing controversy in some quarters
about the state of student self-
government.

Wilson said he believes “the
proper role of any SJC advisor
is to provide support outside the
hearing room...I have concerns
about the administration taking

on functions formerly reserved
for students, but enjoy work-
ing with Dean Dotson. He holds
many valid suggestions for ways
to improve both the SJC and stu-
dent self-governance.”

“I see Dean Dotson as a strong
ally in communicating the SJC’s
ability to function independently
and j udiciously," he said.

Another source of contention
on the SJC has been this year’s
policy change that removed the
right to appeal ﬁrst strikes as-
signed by administrators to the
SJC.

“The inability for the SJC to
hear ﬁrst strikes presents a prob-
lem of legitimacy in the eyes of
studer1ts...Before this year, stu-
dents had the option to either sign
off on a ﬁrst strike through an ad-
ministrator or come to the SJC,”
Wilson said.

“I recognize the administrative
strike as a useful way to handle
clear-cut violations,” he allowed,
but went on to say that he will
“strive to reinstate a student’s
ability to present a case before a
body of elected peers.”

With the officers now in place,
elections for EC Representatives
and SJC Justices will be held
Monday, March 19.

IFC looking at SAE

pledge ship activities

Director of Public Safety Mike Young says the allegations facing SAE are
similar in seriousness to the charges currently facing FIJI and Kappa Sig

By Jacob Geiger
MANAG|NG EDITOR

An investigation into the
pledgeship activities of Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon has forced the frater-
nity to suspend pledgeship.

Director of Greek Life Jason
Rodocker said he received infor-
mation about pledgeship activities
“multiple times and from multiple
sources.” Last week he asked Di-
rector of Public Safety Michael
Young to begin an investigation
into SAE’s pledgeship. Young
completed that investigation on
Thursday afternoon and sent his
ﬁndings to Rodocker.

SAE is the ﬁfth fraternity to
be investigated this winter. Phi
Gamma Delta and Kappa Sigma
have both suspend their pledge-
ship activities as a result of these
investigations.

Rodocker said that the Inter-
fraternity Council would hear the
results of Young’s investigations
and consider SAE’s case tonight
during its regularly scheduled
meeting.

“SAE was extremely coop-
erative and very forthcoming,”

~'R'odocker said. ' “They were hon-

, .~,.

“SAE was extremely cooperative and very

making it an easier process. ’

forthcoming. They were honest and that is

est and that is making it an easier
process.”

Young said that he spoke with
several SAE pledges as well as
one of the fratemity’s pledge
trainers. He said he also reviewed
information that had been given
to Rodocker.

SAE president Jordan Wesley
declined to comment because the
case had not yet been heard by
the IFC. He said he hoped to be
able to speak more frankly once
the investigation and case were
complete.

Sophomore member Beau Al-
len -said the chapter did not really
know what would happen and
said the fraternity was trying to
just carry on with its business.

While Young said he could not
detail the allegations against SAE,
he did say they were “similar in
seriousness” to the allegations

brought against FIJI and Kappa
Sigma. FIJI is currently waiting
to appear before the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

SAE, like FIJI, has been in
trouble recently with the IFC.
SAE received a strike from the
IFC in October for having mari-
juana in the fraternity house.
FIJI saw one strike expire in No-
vember but has another strike on
its record until May.

Rodocker said ‘SAE nationals
had not been informed of the in-
vestigation and said they would
not be contacted until after the
IFC has heard the case.

“Nationals are typically not
contacted by me until the truth is
resolved, but that can vary,” he
said.

Though Rodocker and the IFC
have been kept busy with several
serious investigations this winter,

he said none of the situations are
as bad as the allegations that Beta
Theta Pi faced when it was dis-
missed from campus during the
2003-2004 school year.

“The investigations this year
are not anything like what hap-
pened three to four years ago,”
Rodocker said. “They’re not as
bad as they were then, but these
actions are still inappropriate and
unnecessary.”

The IFC, Rodocker said, is
working to reveal as much in-
formation as it can. He said the
Greek governing body wants to
help other chapters understand
what types of behavior are not
acceptable while still trying to
maintain some sort of privacy for
each chapter.

Rodocker and Young both ac-
knowledged that fraternity haz-
ing at other universities is often
more serious than the problems
at W&L, but both pointed think
W&L should continue holding it-
self to a higher standard.

“It is the norm that these things
happen here, and that needs to
change,” Rodocker said. “Many
freshman have told me they think
that sort of thing is OK, and it’s
not.”

W&L touts
new hires

New law dean will leave Richmond
University to take the reigns at W&L

By Dane Davis
sr/arr wamaa

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has announced the hiring of
Rodney A. Smolla and Richard
A. Peterson to Dean of the Law
School and Chief Technology
Ofﬁcer, respectively.

Smolla, currently the Dean
of the University of Richmond’s
T.C. Williams School of Law,
has been hired after an exten-
sive search beginning late in the
summer of 2006. The search
began after the departure of pre-
vious dean David Partlett, who
left to become dean of the law
school at Emory University.

From Partlett’s departure
last summer until February, the
university conducted a search
for an individual possessing the

“[Smolla] is one of

the country ’s fore-

most scholars of the
First Amendment
and a truly outstand-

~ ing teacher ”

BRIAN MURCHINSON,
Acting-«Dean of the
law school

talent and dedication to lead the
W&L’s esteemed law school.
Chaired by President Rus-
cio, a twelve person committee
was formed to review all of the
applicants for the position.
Smolla will take over from
acting-dean Brian Murchison,
who also served last year as
chairman of the school’s presi-
dential search committee.
Professor Murchison is “very
excited about the appointment
of Smolla and what it means for
the future of the law school. He
is one of the country’s foremost
scholars of the First Amend-
ment and a truly outstanding
teacher. He will reinforce the
traditions of excellence at the

Law School and provide dy-
namic leadership for our strate-
gic plan and other ventures.”
Smolla comes with a his-
tory of legal achievement and
is highly respected by his peers.
He displays a strong knowledge
of the legal system, particularly
concerning the First Amend-
ment. In addition to writing nu-
merous legal treatises, Smolla

‘won critical acclaim for his

works such as “Free Speech in
an Open Society” and “Suing
the Press: Libel, the Media, and
Power.”

A.E. Dick Howard, White
Burkett Miller Professor of Law
and Public Affairs at the Univer-
sity of Virginia, said, “Rod has
a national reputation as scholar,
teacher, advocate, and civic and
professional leader. I can think
of no one in the American acad-
emy who has made a greater
imprint on our understanding of
the First Amendment.”

Smolla is not the only addi-
tion to the university as it heads
towards the 2007 school year.

Richard A. Peterson served
as Director of Academic and
Research Computing for Rice

.University before being chosen
‘ by Washington and Lee to serve

as the school’s Chief Technol-
ogy Officer. Peterson will be
the ﬁrst person to hold that po-
sition.

Prior to his tenure at Rice
University, Peterson was the
Director of Information Tech-
nology for the College of Arts
and Sciences at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
from 1999-2005.

As Chief Technology Oﬁ‘1-
cer, Peterson will be responsible
for leadership, planning, and ef-
fective delivery of computing
services throughout campus, for
advancing the W&L’s mission
through the use of technology
and for coordination with cer-
tain academic departments.

Peterson and his staff of 35
will immediately have their
hands full as they convert
W&L’s computers to the new
Windows Vista software.

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 3

Bysacha Raab
STAFF WRITER

At a school as challenging as
Washington and Lee, students of-
ten hear that everyone is a leader.

However, despite constant re-
minders of this fact, how many
students actually take advantage
of the opportunities provided
them to develop their leadership
skills? There is little doubt that
everyone at W&L knows William
“Burr” Datz, the director of lead-
ership development.

He has dedicated the past six
years to the growing leadership
program at W & L. He conducts
leadership seminars with speciﬁc
groups, such as dorm counselors,
fraternities, sororities and sports
teams. Additionally, he leads
weekly leadership seminars open
to anyone who is interested in dis-
covering and building their lead-
ership potential.

Datz strongly advocates
hands-on, experiential learning.
He describes, “If I lecture a group
on leadership, the students will
obtain about 10-20 percent of
the information I give them. If I
demonstrate skills to the members
of a group, they will come away
with about 40-50 percent of what
I show. However, if the group
experiences the leadership exer-
cises, it will retain 75-80 percent
of the information.”

His weekly seminars typically
begin with the group considering
a reﬂective question and talking
about various answers. Datz then
provides a reality check, which
either conﬁrms or corrects the
group’s ideas. He usually spends
the ﬁrst semester of the school
year developing “tangible” bases
of leadership, referring to the con-
crete physical and mental aspects
of leadership. During the second
half of the year, Datz focuses
on the “intangible” elements of

Looking for leadership

Leadership guru Burr Datz keeps exploring new
ways to study leadership and teach W&L students

“If you can tell a story, whether it’s true or not,

and get people to believe it and invest them-

selves in it, then you can build trust. ”

BURR DA12, Director of Leadership Development
 

students how to be leaders while
they observe. Then, he will al-
low the students to take part in
the activities while he continues
to demonstrate them. Eventu-
ally, the students will be perform-
ing the majority of the leadership
activities while Datz continues to

provide some help. The students I

are eventually able to utilize their
leadership skills without any as-
sistance.

~ Datz believes, “If you can tell
a story, whether it’s true or not,
and get people to believe it and
invest themselves in it, then you
can build trust.”

Therinain steps of leadership,
according to Datz, are to assess
the situation, make a plan, make
the ﬁnal preparations for the plan,
lead the plan, and ﬁnally evaluate
it. Datz describes life as a dance
floor and everyone is dancing. In
the ﬁnal step of evaluating the
plan, his goal is to “pull students,

as leaders, to the balcony to ob-
serve these dance systems.”

The greatest beneﬁt to students
of these leadership seminars is the
ability to get to know oneself and
one’s strengths and weaknesses.
Seminars with groups such as
Greek chapters or sports teams
provide the best kind of peer pres-
sure. Students are able to develop
their faith and trust in each other.
Datz explains the primary steps
of leadership and group work as
knowing “Where we are going,
what we are doing, how we know
when we get there, and how we
will do this together.”

While the weekly seminars
are not usually packed full of stu-
dents, Datz’s work with groups
on campus has been widely ap-
preciated and the feedback very
positive.

At a school full of leaders,
Datz keeps working to show stu-
dents the way.

Protecting
counselors

I heard from one of the peer
counselors today that Mike

‘ Young was quoted as saying that

the Peer Counseling program was
one source of information he used
to get information about fraternity
hazing. This is incorrect inforrna—
ition, as peer counselors take a
pledge of conﬁdentiality and are
;not allowed to disclose any in—
formation reported to them about
‘fraternity hazing. Student trust in
conﬁdentiality of peer counseling
contacts is very important to the
program.

‘ Just to clarify, the peer coun-
;selors do not report any infor-
mation presented to them about
hazing. They may discuss with
‘pledges the options available to
them, including the conﬁdential
-hazing line, but they do not make

any report. In addition, they do

not report any rule violations, in-

cluding honor violations. They
do not report any substance use.
They do not report any crimes
reported to them. The only cir-
cumstances where they might
break conﬁdentiality is if a stu-
dent coming to them presents a
real possibility of harm to self or
others, as in suicidal or homicidal
ideas. In that case, the PC would
consult with the University Coun-
selor on call, and the University
Counselor would make a clinical
decision about what action was
needed to protect the student or
others from harm.

Thank you very much for your
help,

Kirk Luder

The EC is decision to hear cases involving sexual assault raises some
serious questions about the group is ability to deal with these trials

The SFHB may issue punish-
ments in these cases that range
from counseling to dismissal
from W&L.

The EC may mean well
with this new proposal, but al-
lowing students to take sexual
assault cases before the EC and
SFHB is both redundant and
unnecessary.

The SFHB was organized
and trained to investigate and
vote on sexual assault cases.

Do members of the EC
have the training and resources

to run a thorough and fair in-
vestigation into sexual assault
cases?

Investigations of sexual as-
sault allegations are far more
complicated and delicate than
an investigation into cheating.
Do students on the EC have
the training to interview a rape
victim?

Since the SFHB currently
relies on the Director of Public

The beastly side of beauty and power

-Nationals for Delta Zeta swoop in and force out even the president in an eﬂort to increase recruitment at DePauw

§By Grace Andrews
COLUMNIST

Today’s topic is one of my fa-
vorites: beauty.

The Delta Zetas of DePauw
have learned a lesson about
‘beauty that many wish were not
-true. DePauw’s chapter recently
became victim to what they claim
is image discrimination.

The national chapter of Delta
:Zeta, in an attempt to improve
“commitment to recruit for the
chapter,” decided to revamp the
chapter at DePauw and increase

recruitment.

On DePauw’s campus, the la-
dies of Delta Zeta were known
more for being scholarly than
sexy. Their chapter consisted of
women from diverse backgrounds
and appearances. In fact, Delta
Zeta chapters all across the coun-
try are known for being extremely
diverse and open.

However, when the national
chapter arrived at DePauw’s cam-
pus, they proceeded to ask 23 of
the 35 members, who were black,
Asian, overweight, or “unattract-
ive,” to leave the organization.

According to ABC News, “the
sorority kept sisters who were
popular with fraternities.”

ABC News also said the na-
tional chapter cited “a steady de-
cline in membership in the Delta
Chapter over several years” and
said “the viability of the chapter
was in question.”

Those were the reasons they
gave for asking the 23 women
to leave. The national chapter
claims that appearance had noth-
ing to do with it.

Since the reasons why those
23 were asked to leave was never

speciﬁed, their assumptions have
yet to be proveri incorrect;

The situation at DePauw raises
questions that have long plagued
the sorority scene. Although so-
rorities are based upon sisterhood,
character, and service, physical
attributes could inﬂuence some
sororities during their selection
process.

As progressive as we would
like to think we are, it would be
ridiculous to say that our society
does not value looks.

If you look in magazines and
movies, the push to be thin and

attractive is everywhere. It is be-

"cause of the importance placed

on physical beauty that a national
Greek letter organization would
even consider thinking that “at-
tractive” members could attract
more women to the chapter. How-
ever, I am not making excuses for
the Delta Zeta national chapter.

They had no right whatsoever
to evict any of the Delta Zeta
women at DePauw without legiti-
mate reasons.

I think that this situation has
opened up dialogue concem—
ing shallowness within not only

college practices, but society as .

a whole. Frankly, I believe it is
about time.

So what if the ladies who were
in Delta Zeta were not America’s
Next Top Model or had the hottest
bodies? How many people even
truly look like that?

Perfection should never be our
aim or even promoted.

The outrage that has ensued
over the DePauw controversy
makes me hopeful for the future.
It shows that our country is mak-
ing leaps and bounds into the right
direction.

Britney’s big breakdown

Could somebody please remind us why America should care about Britney?

By Cody Beauchamp
c 0 L U M N I s T
An Open Letter to Britney
Spears:
Hey Brit!

We just wanted to let you know
that even though everyone in the
world is giving you a hard time,
we as a society are here for you.
We’re not really sure why we still
care about your antics, but let’s
face it -- we’re a slave for you.

Wow. So, where to start? First
off, we love the new ‘do. It’s very
Sinead O’Conner. Way to get
your career back on track ~ re-
shaping your image so that it re-
minds us of that so-so singer who
went batty on SNL and tore up a
picture of the Pope. Hey, maybe
you should do that? Given how
our ﬁrst memory of you was the
slutty Catholic schoolgirl thing,
it’d be like you came full circle.
(Besides, this Pope isn’t as cuddly
as the last one, so you might get
cut a little more slack.)

We’ll go talk to Lorne Mi-
chaels about letting you guest
host. Wait! How do you feel
about Madonna as musical guest?
Get back to us on that.

Of course, it’d also be pretty
awesome if we could get Justin.
You two used to be such a cute
couple. And now that you’ve got
the same hair-style, a mash-up of
“Toxic” and “My Love” would
only be that much better! Could

It ’d be pretty awesome if we could get Justin...

And now that you ’ve got the same hair-style, a

mash-up of “Toxic ” and “My Love ” would only

be that much better!

someone call Timbaland?

Speaking of music, can we
expect anything out of you soon?
We know that it must be hard to
ﬁnd the time to write music, what
with the family you’ve got now.
All that money that you’re spend-
ing on professional nannies has to
come from somewhere though!

And now that you don’t have
K-Fed’s rap career to keep the Red
Bull on the table, you really are in
a ﬁx, huh? Maybe you should see
if Paris can spot you some?

Although, if you wanted, I bet
that some of the frats have mixers
coming up that you could play.
Used to be Cool? Rock Stars and
Rehabbers? The Letter D (in your
case “disaster”)?

Of course, that’s assuming that
we still have frats in a few days.
Someone in the administration
might overhear “that was a rock-
ing party” and misinterpret it to
mean pledges are getting stoned
Biblical style. There’s also the
strong possibility that F IJI’s
super-extra-serious-we-really-
mean-it-this—time probation will
be violated and the administration

will just decide to do away com-
pletely with one of W&L’s most
distinguishing characteristics—a
strong Greek community.

Not that we actually believe
the administration to be like that,
it’s just that we have no way of
knowing, since the IFC and the
SAC (when and how did they get
involved anyway?) don’t feel the
need to be transparent or open
about their actions.

But, don’t worry Brit. Even
if we don’t have frats we’ll still
have Fancy Dress.‘ It really is
mind-boggling.

Anyway, the point is we want
to see you make a comeback.
You’ve had a rough time, you
know? It’s not like you were in-
credibly lucky and were given a
golden pass to fame by some very
savvy pop producer. It’s not like
you’ve completely blown oppor-
tunities millions of aspiring artists
would have killed to have had to be
a millionaire entertainer. You’ve
had to “work” hard. You’ve had
to, like, sing for hours, and only
for a few million. You’ve had the
paparazzi hound you when you’re

making an idiot of yourself with
Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan
at some club. You’re just not that
innocent.

Don’t worry about losing our
attention though. See, we as a
culture love to shower seemingly
pointless media attention on peo-
ple who make no measurable con-
tributions to culture, society, even
pop culture. I mean, never mind
that there are hundreds of better
entertainers out there, you went
nuts and got a new tattoo—let’s
cover that!

Never mind that there are so
many truly talented new bands,
musicians, actors, writers and
singers being discovered every
day—you were seen lip—locking
with some C-list actor outside the
auditions for VH1 ’s “The Surreal
Life 39.” Stop the presses!

So keep your chin up Brit-
ney! You’ll get out of rehab in a
few weeks, and then you can get
back to that whole making music
thing that made you rich in the
ﬁrst place. We’ll patiently wait
for you, but we’re going to point-
lessly shower Nicole Richie with
attention until you get back, al-
right? Cool.

PS — If you really wanted to
grab national attention, you could
overdose a la Anna Nicole. On
second though, don’t do that—the
media coverage would probably
just get swallowed up by word
that Ashley Olsen is-ohm-
ygawd!—not eating.

Faculty Alums
reflect on PD

experiences

By Sarah Kientz
STAFF WRITER

As this year marked the 100"‘
anniversary of Fancy Dress, some
of our faculty alumni commented
on their own Fancy Dress expe-
riences and how the dance has
changed through the years.

History professor Holt Mer-
chant. class of 1961, said Fancy
Dress was much ditlierent when
he was a student at W&L.

Merchant said there were four
major dances throughout the year,
and what set Fancy Dress apart
was that students wore costumes
corresponding with the theme.

“There was a committee that
ran each [dance] and there was a
prestige to belonging to the com-
mittee, so it was always run by
the Phi Dells and SAF.s.”° Mer-
chant said.

The theme of each dance al-
ways included a character or au-
thority ﬁgure, Merchant said, and
boys who headed the corrrmittee
were “always the ones who did it,
so they had the best costumes.”

Merchant said the ba.rrds that
played at Fancy Dress when he
was a student played “real music,
not what passes through music
now.” l\lerchant said bands like
The Temptations, The Four—Tops
and Duke Ellington have all
played at Fancy Dress. Now, Mer-
chant said, the bands featured at
FD are one reason he has stopped
attending the event.

“The last Fancy Dress I went
to was a heayy metal singer who
wore nothing but a diaper and
I said. Never again!" Merchant
said.

Merchant also added that he
stopped attending Fancy Dress
because of the behavior of stu-
dents. They may be dressed for-
mally. he said. but they do not
exhibit “fomral behavior."

“One thing that stopped me
from going was my drunken stu-
dents telling me what they really
thought of me when I didn’t really
want to know,” Merchant said.

Though Merchant said his
days of attending Fancy Dress are
over. there was also a time when
many students did not attend the
event either.

“In the 70s [the popularity of
Fancy Dress] died out for a while.
Students were rebelling against
almost everything the school had
done before —~ the dress code. the
honor system,” Merchant said.
“Anything that looked that formal
students wouldnt have anything
to do witlr."

Jim Farrar. assistant to presi-
dent Ruscio, graduated from
W&I. in 1974. Farrar said Fancy
Dress did not really exist for a few
years in the 70s. Instead, there
were a few years where students
attended concerts.

“That was right in the middle
of student unrest days. It was a
period of pushing the envelope
and testing tradition," Farrar said.
“People were less inclined to wear

_ costumes and formal attire than

to do their own thing. They were
good concerts, and it was a lot of
fun, but it was just different.”

Farrar said that Fancy Dress
reverted to its original format his
senior year.

“In retrospect it was nice to
have a break and come back to
it,” Farrar said. “It’s always good
to experiment, and that’s what the
70s were all about. It was appro-
priate for the times.”

Now, Farrar believes FD is
one of W&L’s “better institutional
traditions.”

“It’s fun, and it allows students
to exercise creativity, but it comes
with the expectation that fun is
conducted in an appropriate man-
ner,” Farrar said. “It’s important
this year to pause and observe
the tradition that will continue in
a positive manner for a long time
to come.”

Journalism professor Brian
Richardson also attended Fancy
Dress before graduating in 1973.
The controversy at Kent State oc-
curred the spring of his freshman
year, and consequently “campus-
es were in upheaval all over the
country, including this one.”

“Fraternity membership was
on the decline, and there was a
counterculture atmosphere by a
signiﬁcant number of people,”
Richardson said. “There just was
not enough interest in a Fancy
Dress.”

Though there was no formal
event, Richardson said the con-
certs were still “wildly popular.”
In 1972, the 1950s revival group
Sha-na-na came to W&L. Rich-
ardson said that everyone dressed
like 1950s greasers for the con-
cert, which was known that year
as “Greasy Dress.”

“Everybody went and had
a great time," Richardson said.
“People didn’t spend weeks he-
forehand getting a date and plan-
ning a big dinner. It was not near-
ly as big ofa deal as FD is now, it
was more like a big concert.”

Richardson attributes the pop-
ularity of Fancy Dress to its tim-
ing at the end of winter.

“It’s almost the end of winter,
we've survived February. spring
is in the air and the end of win-
ter term is in sight, everyone just

wants to kick up their heels a lit- ,

tle bit,” Richardson said. “I don't
think it would have continued as
robustly as it has if it wasn’t to
celebrate the end of winter. Plus
this is a place that just breathes
tradition.”

President Ken Ruscio also
spoke of the presence of tradition
at Fancy Dress.

Though he admits the event
has changed, “what has not
changed is the spirit, a time for
friendship, and a time for the
community-—faculty, staff, stu-
dents, and alunmi—to come to-
gether as one,” Ruscio said. “It
creates memories that live well
past graduation and remains one
of those distinctive features of the
University that link our past with
the present and the future."

A century
of tradition

Continued from cover

of a quarter million budget. she
said. “Originally. we thought
maybe we would have a larger
budget. ()ur budget is larger than
rrorrrral year. but it is nothing close
to that."

De Grazia also said that the ma-
jority of the budget went towards
entertainment. The Pat Patrick
Band is originally from Nashville,
Tenn, and has played at numer-
ous venues including the White
House. The band played music of
all genres. including pop, soul and
rock and roll.

“Since we expect[ed] more
alunrni this year, we really wanted
to appeal to all age groups," De
Grazia said.

The comnrittee, according to
Tsiknakis, has been meeting all
year. In the fall. students can ﬁll
out applications to be a part of a
sub-corrrnrittee. If they are cho-

sen, they are required to dedicate
30 hours of their time to their du-
ties.

“The biggest challenge was
at the very beginning of our
process when we were select-
ing the eommittee members,"
Tsiknakis said. “We received
over 100 applications this year,
and we generally take less than
50 members. We would like to
take everyone, but that obviously
can’t happen.”

De Grazia said she was ex-
tremely proud of the eﬂ“orts of
every committee member.

At the end of the night, guests
exited, exhausted from two-step-
ping to tunes like ‘Sweet Home
Alabama.’

Couples then enjoyed a free
breakfast of eggs and watﬂes in
Evans Dining Hall alter a night
they will not forget.

Try a combo.

Some did it right, but some did
it way wrong. There were some
dresses with a lovely balance of
the two extreme colors, using
them to complement each other.
Then, there were those that

had the effect of a heinous tutu
from second—grade ballet recital.
Balance is everything with black
and white (but that doesn’t mean
equal use ofthe two, like in this
gingham tablecloth dress).

Kat Greene keeps her eye out for the biggest trends at the ball.

In short order.

Some like it hot. but “black and white
ball" doesn't imply dressing like you
were about to attend a football game.
The completely inappropriate sundress
and flip—flop outfit isjust lazy. But others
pulled off the short look with a sleek.
chic cut and sky-high heels.

When in Rome...

The Roman goddess dress was a
lovely way to embrace the black and
white theme. The lightweight material
was veryflattering, which is why it
was such a popular choice. One dress
had a particularly nice deep neckline,
which accents anyone's ﬁgure well.

Prints and
princesses.

Prints are always hit—or-miss.
Since black and white ﬂorals
are showing this spring, it was
an easy choice for some. Not to
rule out animal prints, either.
Ordinarily, they would be a
mistake, but several dresses
pulled it off with class.

  

School uniform.

The W&Ltie and cumberbund combo was
so outrageous it was almost cute. We get
it—-it's a black and white ball at W&L...so
you're wearing black and white and W&L.
Adorable. At least you didn't wear alight
blue shirt with a white collar and a dark blue
Vineyard Vines patterned tie. That means
you, Johnson Brownlow.

Women’s Lacrosse

The Washington and Lee wom-
en’s lacrosse team fell to eighth-
ranked Franklin and Marshall
11-9 on Saturday afternoon.
Franklin & Marshall jumped
out to an early 2-0 lead, but the
Generals responded with ﬁve

 

unanswered goals to build a 5-2
lead with 10:34 to play in the
ﬁrst half. Going into the half,
the Generals were up 6-5. As the
second half opened, senior mid-
ﬁelder Mallory Lobisser found
the back of the net to give the
Generals a two-goal lead. How-
ever, F&M scored four-straight
goals to assume a 9-7 lead. A
score by sophomore midﬁelder
Colleen Evans closed F&M’s
edge to one goal, but F&M put
the game away with two goals
late in the half. The Generals
were led by Evans, who scored
three goals, and sophomore
attacker Kelsi Robinson’s one
goal and two assists. Evans is
leading the Generals in goals so
far this season, while Robinson
is the team’s leading scorer. Se-
nior midﬁelder Kelly Evans and
junior midﬁelder Megan Slosson
each added one goal and one as-
sist. Junior Sarah Tilbor guarded
the net for the entire game for the
Generals, registering a season-
high 13 saves. The Generals im-
proved their record on the season
to 4-1. The Generals return to the
ﬁeld on Wednesday when they
host ODAC-foe Bridgewater at
4:00 p.m.

Baseball ,

The Washington and Lee base-

ball team extended its winning

streak to nine straight games

with a 6-3 road victory over

Mary Washington on Sunday

afternoon. The Generals im-

proved their record to 11-3 on

the season. In the Mary Wash-

ington game, the Generals took

a 2-0 lead into the top of the ﬁfth

inning, but Mary Washington

tacked on two runs to tie the

game going into the sixth inning.

The Generals scored a pair of
runs in the top of the eighth in-

ning to take a 4-2 lead and held
on to the lead despite another
Mary Washington score in the

bottom of the eighth inning. The

Generals added two more runs

in the top of the ninth inning to

end the game with a 6-3 victory.

The Generals were paced by
senior designated hitter Richard
Garland, who went 2-for-3 and
senior shortstop Ray Sweeney’s
2-for-4 performance. Senior Jor-
dan Wesley was 1-for-1 with two
RBI, while junior leftﬁelder Tim
Livingston went 2-for-4 with
an RBI and freshman catcher
Will Lewis when 1-for-3 with
an RBI. Freshman right-hander
Chuck Davidson tossed the ﬁrst
ﬁve innings of play, allowing
just three hits and two unearned
runs. Junior lefthander Jeff
Pharis relieved him for two and
two-thirds innings and picked
up his ﬁrst win of the season.

Freshman Jim Plantholt pitched
the ﬁnal one and a third innings
to notch his fourth save of the
year.The Generals return to the
ﬁeld on Friday when they host
Villa Julie, and they will also
host Virginia Wesleyan in a
doubleheader on Saturday.

against Washington Col-
lege in the last half of the
third quarter when they al-
lowed three goals in five
minutes.

The Generals rallied,
scoring once more in the
third and twice in the
fourth, but it was too little,
too late. Ryan, who sniped
the final goal in that game,
said the loss isn’t reflective

of the team’s abilities.

He said that the players
have improved drastically
under the guidance of their
coach, Gene McCabe.

This is the team’s first
season under McCabe, but
Ryan said that he expects
the team to do very well
when ODAC play starts.

to each year.

Still, the team has some
work to do if it wants to
improve in the conference.
Although Ryan says the
team is a “force to be reck-
oned with" in the ODAC, it
was ranked a measly fourth
in the seven-team confer-
ence.

“The conference games
are the main thing that
matters,” Ryan said, “but
we keep getting better each
day.”

The Washington and Lee
men’s tennis team completed a
perfect week with their defeat of
Washington College Sunday af-
temoon.

The men, who were picked
to ﬁnish ﬁrst in the ODAC this
season, defeated conference op-
ponents Randolph-Macon and
Hampden-Sydney as well as non-
conference opponents Denison
University and Washington Col-
lege.

The week was highlighted by
a 5-4 victory over 17"‘-ranked
Denison University on Saturday.

The Generals got off to a
strong start with the ﬁrst doubles
team of juniors Tim-Ross and Nat
Estes defeating Denison’s Kevin
Newman and Randy Lofgren 8-2
to give W&L the first point of the
match.

However, Denison claimed the
remaining two doubles matches
to take a 2-1 lead going into the
singles matches. Denison’s James
Davis and Jordan Buehler defeat-
ed Jon Malooly and Jamie McCa-
rdell by a score of 8-3.

Stuart Sanford and Andrew,E,._l-
lison fell to Denison’s duo of
Hodgkiss-Lilly and Charlie Poe,‘
also by a score of 8-3.

The Generals won three of the
ﬁrst four singles matches to gain a
one point advantage in the match.

‘Estes defeated Jordan Buehler 6-

4, 6-4, in second singles, Malooly
defeated James Davis 7-5, 6-1, in
third singles, Stuart Sanford best-
ed Poe 6-3, 6-3 in sixth singles
and Nelson Bunn fell to Kevin
Newman 7-6, 6-3.

With the Generals leading 4-3,
Ross sealed the win for the Gener-
als when he defeated Randy Lof-
gren 6-4, 7-5 in the ﬁrst singles
match. Denison’s Tom Hodgkiss-
Lilly would win the ﬁnal match
over McCardell, 2-6, 7-5, 7-5, but
the Generals won the match 5-4.

On Tuesday the Generals trav-
eled to Randolph-Macon and
defeated the Yellow Jackets 9-0.

erals only dropped three games.

On Wednesday the Gener-
als hosted Hampden-Sydney and
bested the Tigers 8-1. Playing No.
2 singles, Nat Estes dropped only
one game en route to his victories
over Chris Picarde of Randolph-
Macon and Richie Holzaphel of
Hampden-Sydney.

On Sunday, the Generals best-
ed Washington College, who was
ranked 10“‘ in the region, 7-2. Ja-
mie McCardell and Malooly de-
feated Washington College’s duo
of Todd Green and Brian Danver

‘8-3 in No. 2 doubles while Bunn

and Alex Brook defeated Midial
Sentala and Derek Wise 8-1 in

No. 3 doubles to give the Gener-
als a 2-1 advantage heading into
the singles competition.

The Generals took ﬁve of the
six singles matches to seal the
team victory.

Halfway through the ﬁrst set in
the No. 2 singles match between
W&L’s Estes and Washington
College’s Rafael Roldan, Roldan
questionably called Estes’ serve
out. Estes protested vehemently
but Roldan refused to change his
mind. After a brief standoff, play
resumed and Estes won the ﬁrst
set 6-3 and proceeded to sweep
the second set 6-0.

Other victorious Generals in-

cluded Malooly, who defeated
Brian Danver 6-0, 6-1, McCa-
rdell, who bested Todd Green 7-
5, 6-2, Bunn, who beat Timothy
Parks 6-1, 6-1, and Sanford, who
swept Midial Santala 6-0, 6-0.

Washington College was led
by Arturo Solis who defeated
Ross 6-4, 6-2, in No. 1 singles and
paired with Roldan to defeat Ross
and Estes 8-4 in No. 1 doubles.

The Generals return to com-
petition this Tuesday as they
travel to Virginia Wesleyan Col-
lege to take on the Marlins, who
were picked to ﬁnish third in the
ODAC preseason poll.

It was business as usual
for the Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team as they
took on two opponents Sat-
urday afternoon. ‘

A true testament to the
team’s incredible depth, the
Generals were able to take
on two non-conference op-
ponents, using two different
lineups. The Generals started
the day with a commanding
8-1 victory over Washing-
ton College. Later in the af-
ternoon, the team defeated
Denison College, a team that
has given W&L problems in
the past, in ﬁne form, 8-1.

Against Denison, who is
ranked 16th in the nation,
sophomore Katie Tabb was
victorious at ﬁrst singles, 6-
4, 6-3, while junior Ginny
Woitham was pushed to a
tie-breaker in order to win
at second singles, 5-7, 7-6

It’s been a sister act for
the Washington and Lee
women’s lacrosse team this
season.

Senior captain Kelly Ev-
ans has been joined on the
ﬁeld by her younger sister,
sophomore Colleen, who
transferred to W&L from
Bucknell University.

Originally from Lexing-
ton, the sisters have com-
bined for 18 goals and 11 as-
sists in the team’s ﬁve games.
Colleen is second in the team
in scoring, and Kelly is third.
Colleen is leading the team

in goals scored, while Kelly _

is leading the team in shot
percentage.

The two bring a new dy-
namic to the team, since they
have grown up playing to-

gether.

Colleen said, “Playing
with the sis has been great.
It’s deﬁnitely a throwback to
high school. .

“But both Kelly and I
have developed and changed
as players a lot since high
school - so its fun to see what
we are working with now and
if we can still connect the
way we did four years ago.”

Colleen, who got a taste
of Division I lacrosse at
Bucknell last year, is happy
to be back playing in her
hometown:

“Once I got [to Bucknell]
I realized that I liked [it],
but didn’t love it. Playing
lacrosse year round was a
commitment I didn’t want to
make. I think I was compar-
ing everything there to W&L,
and realized that W&L is
unique.

“Colleen Evans has been a tremendous

addition to the team. She can play the

wholeﬁel . ”

KELSI ROBINSON, sophomore attacker
 

“Nowhere else is like it.
Then I knew that this was
actually where I wanted to
be, it just took me leaving to
realize it.”

In Saturday’s 11-9 loss to
eighth-ranked Franklin and
Marshall, Colleen led the
Generals with three goals,
while Kelly chipped in one
goal and two assists.

The sisters have been
a force for the Generals
throughout the entire season.

The Generals have got-
ten off to a great 4-1 start,
including a victory over 13th

ranked St. Mary ’s for the ﬁrst
time in program history.

Also making big contri-
butions for the Generals has
been sophomore Kelsi Rob-
inson, who is leading the
Generals in scoring with 10
goals and 6 assists.

Sophomore Ali Hillyard
and junior Sarah Tilbor have
been splitting time in goal,
only allowing 32 goals over
5 games.

While the Evans sisters
may be tearing up the ﬁeld,
they also are having a lot of
fun playing together.

Colleen said, “Being on a

team with her again has been
the usual mayhem it always
was. She gives me a hard
time, and she has gotten the
whole team to call me Bean,
her dreadful nickname for
me.”
Colleen is not the only
one happy to be playing for
the Generals this season, as
her teammates have really
appreciated her additions to
the team.

Sophomore Kelsi Robin-
son said, “Colleen Evans has
been a tremendous addition
to the team.

“She can play the whole
ﬁeld--scoring, assisting, and
very strong on defense as
well”

The Generals return to
action on Wednesday when
they host ODAC-foe Bridge-
water College at 4 p.m.

W&L baseball team 0/7 to a strong start and a nine—game win
streak which has catapulted them into ﬁrst place in the ODAC

By Russ Weems
STAFF WRITER

Generals baseball extended
its winning streak to nine games
with six wins this week. Washing-
ton and Lee played Mount Aloy-
sius twice, Guilford once and
Eastern Mennonite twice. But the
weekend was capped off when
the team beat Mary Washington
in Fredericksburg Sunday.

“So far we’ve been play-
ing good baseball, and we’ve
been swinging the bats well. We
are making the most of the rou-
tine plays, and we’ve had strong
pitching,” said freshman Charles
Davidson.

The Generals opened the week
with a sweep of Mount Aloysius.
In the ﬁrst game, the Mounties
jumped out to a 5-0 lead. W&L
was losing 6-3 going into the
ﬁfth when they scored an impres-
sive eleven runs. The inning was
capped off by a three-run shot by
senior Ray Sweeney. The Gener-
als added two more scores leaving

the ﬁnal 15-7. Leading the bats for
the Generals was sophomore Ter-
rence McKelvey, who went two
for three with a double, W&L also
dominated the second game against
the Mounties, giving the Generals

two for three again with a double
and two RBI. Senior DH Richard
Garland went three for three, and
Sweeney went two for four. Right
hander Davidson got his ﬁrst ca-
reer win in a six inning shutout ef-
fort allowing only two hits.

The winning streak extended
to six with a 4-1 over Guilford.
The game opened up quickly for

the Generals with two solos shots
from McKelvey and David Mill-
er.

In the fourth, W&L added their

‘ﬁnal two runs aided by a triple by

Sweeney. The Quakers scored a
run in the eighth, but it was too
little too late. The Generals came
out on top, 4-1. Marcott recorded
another win with six innings of
scoreless baseball. Garland went
three for four, and Sweeney went
two for three. Overall, the Gen-
erals had a good showing with
strong pitching and active bats.
In their ﬁnal games of the
week, W&L swept Eastern Men-
nonite to push the streak to eight
games. The Generals dominated,
winning one by eight and one
by nine. In the ﬁrst game, W&L
scored nine runs in the ﬁrst three
innings and never looked back.

Pittman honored

All-American soccer player one of 5 8 fall athletes awarded NCAA

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING canon

After receiving plenty of rec-
ognition last fall for his perfor-
mance on the soccer ﬁeld during
the past four years, senior de-
fender Scot Pittman is now being
honored for his work on and off
the ﬁeld.

Pittman was one of 58 NCAA
fall athletes honored with a
post-graduate scholarship worth
$7,500 for part-time or full-time
graduate work.

The NCAA honors a different
set of athletes each season.

Pittman is the seventh Wash-
ington and Lee athlete in ﬁve
years to be honored.

Pittman said his coach, Rolf
Piranian, told him about the
scholarship.

Pittman had to submit recom-
mendations from his coach and a
teacher, forms explaining his vol-
unteer work and campus leader-
ship roles and a short essay about
his post-graduation plans.

As a student, Pittman has been
on the honor roll three times and
the Dean’s List four times.

He is a member of Omicron

Delta Kappa, and he is a peer
counselor. ’

Pittman will graduate from
W&L with a degree in biology,
but he hopes to eventually attend
law school.

The two subjects may seem
unrelated, but Pittman says there
is a connection.

“I was really interested in biol-
ogy coming out of high school,”
he said. “I want to continue the
biology background in law as a
patent lawyer for a pharmaceuti-
cal or genetics company.”

Because the soccer season
kept Pittman from preparing for
the LSAT tests last fall, Pittman
is taking a year off to study for
the tests and then apply to law
schools. During this fall, he
hopes to work as the assistant
soccer coach for his high school.

“There are LSAT prep classes
in Charlotte, where I’m from,”
Pittman said, “so I’ll study and
take the classes at night and then
coach during the day.”

Once the soccer season ends
and his law school applications
are submitted, Pittman said he is
not sure what he’ll do.

He does hope to travel abroad

, Postgraduate Scholarship for academic and athletic excellence

either this summer or next.

On the ﬁeld this fall, Pittman
became the ﬁfth Generals’ soc-
cer player to earn All-American
honors when he was named to
the third team. He was also a ﬁrst
team all-ODAC selection.

With Pittman leading the de-
fense from his central defender
spot, this year’s team started 8-0.

That eight game winning
streak was the program’s best
start in history, and the team
ended up ﬁnishing 12-3-2 with a
6-2-1 record in conference play.
The defense notched 10 shutouts
and allowed only nine goals in 17
games.

Pittman started every game
this year. During his career, he
appeared in 64 games, starting 55
of them. ,

He said this year’s 8-0 start and
the team’s trip to the ODAC ﬁnals
when he was a freshman stand out
as memorable moments.

“Freshman year at the ODAC
ﬁnals in Virginia Wesleyan was
great because nobody expected us
to get that far,” Pittman said.

“And it was a lot of fun this
year when we set the record this
year for best start.”

on his way to a W.

The second game was much of
the same. The Generals scored 14
runs in the ﬁrst four innings. This
deﬁcit was too large for EMU to
overcome, and the ﬁnal score was
17-4. Second baseman Miller had
a big performance; he went four
for seven with two doubles and
four RBI. Junior James Mad-
den also had a multi-hit day with
a double and two RBI‘s.
John Parker pitched nearly seven
innings and recorded six strike-
outs in his win.

Garland and Sweeney con-
tinuted their successes Sunday
against Mary Washington, each
getting two hits. Davidson did
well in his ﬁrst start, but fresh-
man righthander Jim Plantholt
walked away with the save, the
fourth of his college career.

The Generals’ next three
games are at home this weekend,
including a double-header against
defending ODAC champs Virgin-
ia Wesleyan.
