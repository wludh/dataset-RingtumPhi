Author urges graduates
to aid the weak and poor

STAFF WRITER

Bestselling author John
Grisham reminded graduating
law students of the social and
moral duties the legal profes-
sion entails at their commence-
ment Saturday morning.

“Legal aid is the last line
of defense for poor people and
those who are weak,” Grisham
said. “When that last line of
defense is breached we are all
diminished.”

The graduates entered the
ceremony to the strains of bag-
pipes as friends and relatives
scrambled to take pictures.

The air was heavy with
humidity from the previous
night’s storm, and attendees
fanned themselves with the
programs left on the seats.

Law dean Brian Murchi-
son introduced Grisham, who
practiced law in a small Mis-
sissippi town before writing
best-selling legal thrillers
such as The Pelican Brief, The
Firm, and The Brethren.

Rather than drawing on ma-
terial from his books, Grisham
emphasized the real-life prob-

gas after commencement,
said Grisham spoke about real
problems.

“What I liked best was how
he didn’t just say to be a good
person,” said Castleman. “He
gave examples of things to
do.”

Adam Hull, President of
the Student Bar Association,
described the speech as a kind
of “call to arms” for those pur-
suing the legal profession.

Hull said that Class of 2007
President Allison Langston
and Vice President Becca Staf-
ford started working early to
get a good speaker this year.

Langston said the process
began with an email sent out
to the student body asking for
suggestions about the speak-
er. Grisham’s name just kept
coming up.

“He was deﬁnitely our
number one choice,” Langston

. said.

- A group consisting of
Langston, Stafford, Murchi-
son, and Dean Sidney Evans
wrote a letter asking Grisham
to speak at commencement.

“Legal aid is the last line of defense for
poor people and those who are weak, ”
Grisham said. “When that last line of de-

fense is breached we are all diminished ”

JOHN GRISHAM, bestselling author
 

C lems facing many in the legal

system today.

He spoke of the poor, the
homeless, and the wrongfully
convicted. He spoke of public
service legal projects that are
“underfunded, understaffed,
and incredibly in need of
young people to volunteer.”

To illustrate his point,
Grisham told the story of a
homeless man named Cleve-
land who was stuck in a kind
of legal limbo. His lawyer,
who took his case pro bono,
tried to wade through the bu-
reaucracy to settle Cleveland’s
claim. The advocate requested
some documents and was get-
ting nowhere withthe claim
until he mentioned that he was
a lawyer. Suddenly, the bu-
reaucracy ﬁmctioned without
problem.

“When used properly, your
license to practice law is a
powerful tool,” Grisham said.

Grisham went on to speak
about his own pro bono work.
He recalled that many of it
wasn’t intended as community
service at ﬁrst, but impover-
ished clients could not pay.

“Looking back, those
are the cases I remember,”
Grisham claimed. “Those are
the moments in my career that
I truly felt needed.”

Charles Castleman, who
plans to practice in Las Ve-

Langston emphasized the
role the deans and Stafford
played in helping with the pro-
cess.

Grisham almost wasn’t the
commencement speaker, ac-
cording to Langston. After a
long period with no response,

, they were about to move on

to the second choice speaker
when they received a letter
from Grisham. Langston was
overjoyed.

“The threads of integ-
rity and justice [in Grisham’s
work] match'up with what
Washington and Lee is all
about,” Langston said.

She also saw common
themes between Grisham’s
commencement speech and
recent projects at the law
school.

The law school recently
started doing _casework for
the Innocence Project, which
Grisham mentioned several
times in his speech. The In-
nocence Project is a non-profit
organization devoted to free-
ing the wrongfully convicted.

Langston says her own ex-
periences and Grisham’s nov-
els have helped her realize the
power and responsibility that
can be a part of the legal pro-
fession. ,

“You can turn it around
for someone who otherwise
wouldn’t get help.”

spring dig loo

By Dane Davls and Grace Wang
STAFF WRITERS

Relics of Washington and Lee’s
long-standing history are currently
being unearthed by students of An-
thropology 377, Field Techniques in
Archaeology, right outside of New-
comb Hall. Led by Professors Ber-
nard Means and Laura Galke, students
have discovered exciting artifacts that
illuminate early W&L’s students’ day-
to-day lives.

“Our ﬁrst and primary objective of
the dig is to teach students the entire
process of archaeological excavation,
from working in the ﬁeld, through
processing of artifacts, to producing
a report on their wor ,” said Means,
a Visiting Assistant Professor of An-
thropology.

The class is investigating one of
the ﬁrst structures built on the Hill af-
ter Liberty Hall Academy, a precursor
of W&L located near the current soc-
cer ﬁelds, burned in 1803.

Two academic buildings, Graham
and Union Halls, were built on either
side of what is now Robinson and
Payne Halls on the Colonnade, and
were eventually replaced by two brick
dormitories. Today, Tucker and New-
comb Halls stand in these locations.

In excavating this site outside of
Newcomb Hall, both faculty and stu-
dents hope to shed light on past stu-
dent life. 4

“As part of our research, we are
trying to locate exactly where Union
Hall was and we are looking espe-
cially for artifacts associated with
student life -- since student life is not
mentioned in detail in official campus
records,” explained Means.

The anthropology class has been
digging Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays during spring term, and has
just ﬁnished its third week.

Artifacts found during the week
are processed on Thursdays and Fri-
days in the Anthropology Laboratory,
which is located on the back campus.

In addition, the class has engaged
in lectures led by experts in the ﬁeld,

such as Eliot Balazs, a general con-
struction contractor, Lisa Young, a
specialist in archaeological conser-
vation, and Dr. Michael Gregory, a
W&L alumnus.

This collaborative effort between
faculty and students began in 2005
and has continued this year.

Means said, “We ﬁrst dug here
in 2005 and returned in 2007, since
much of the area was actually un-
touched, even though our dig has a
big footprint!”

Students play a major role in the
excavation, incorporating both in-
formation they have learned in their
classroom lectures and hands-on ex-
perience.

Students were surprised to dis-
cover animal bones, ceramic rem-
nants, glass, as well as an abundance
of bricks.

The animal bones and ceramics
were particularly interesting to the
students because it was thought that
cooking within student dorms was
prohibited.

Galke, W&L’s Staff Archaeologist
and co-instructor of the class, said,
“This was a little unexpected, since
Lexington had dining establislnnents
and the college provided a ‘Steward’s
House’ or dining hall.”

Also fascinating to the researchers
was the presence of a pile of bricks
arranged in a diagonal line. This ar-
rangement of bricks challenged pre-
vious thought about the location of
Union Hall.

Means believes this was the most
challenging aspect of the excavation
thus far. .

He said, “The foundations we are
looking for are not quite where we
expected them based on historical re-
cords, but we do seem to be ﬁnding
them now. We also may have found
the base of a chimney used to heat the
dormitory.”

Galke also believes the diversity
of majors and undergraduate levels in
the class has been a challenge, but she
that she has learned to streamline how

she teaches archaeology to students.

Despite this, Means and Galke
have immensely enjoyed the opportu-
nity to work with their students.

Means said, “Student response has
been great. I think at least one more
student has decided to declare an An-
thropology/Archaeology degree than
we started with, and several want to
take more Anthropology classes in the
future.”

In addition, one of the dig students,
Elisa Turner, has obtained a Robert E.
Lee Grant with the help of Means, en-
abling her to build a website based on
this year’s spring dig.

Galke said, “I most enjoy the pro-
cess of discovering new aspects of
the University’s history alongside the
students. Together, we are excavating
an actual archaeological site that has
proven to contain information about
the daily lives of the students who
went here during the 1800s that was
previously unknown. None of us re-
ally know what the next bucket full of
soil will reveal.” '

Excited by the prospect of unearth-
ing the lives of W&L students from
another era, current students have ex-
hibited similar enthusiasm.

Edward Rider, a junior, said, “I
took the class because I heard great
things about it. Plus, it’s outside!”

When asked about what she will
take home from this class, both Brea
Phillips and Turner, Archaeology/An-
thropology majors, believe this class
holds practical applications for their
future careers.

Phillips said, “I’ve learned how to
excavate and work in labs, which will
be helpful after school.”

Turner believes the ﬁeld work has
been a good reality check. She said,
“I am pretty sure I want to practice ar-
chaeology in some capacity in my fu-
ture career, so it’s very interesting to
be excavating for the ﬁrst time. There
is a lot more technical work involved
than I think most people realize goes
into it. . .it’s also a very fun spring
term class.”

Students in Anthropology 377 uncover artifacts that may illuminate the
past lives of W&L students. The dig is taking place next to Newcomb Hall,
which now stands on the slte of Union Hall and an old student dormitory
that was torn down to make way for the current building. The dig'has un-
covered ceramlcs, glass, bricks and even animal bones.

Reevaluate political labels

Even pro—life makes no sense. No sane person is against life.

By Abel Delgado
COLU M N I ST

Nicolas Sarkozy won the French

- election by promising sweeping, al-

most radical changes to the French
economy and way of life. They call
him a “conservative.” What exactly is
he trying to conserve?

Political labels “liberal” and “con-
servative" are far from useful in the
new world of politics and downright
misleading. We use them because
they’re easy. Labels portray certain im-
ages, and we seem not to care whether
or not those images are wrong.

When the term liberal ﬁrst arose, it
was used to describe people who want-
ed more freedom and for government
to have as little power as possible. But
now that sounds like what a traditional
conservative would want.

What those on the “right” would

label a “tax-and-spend liberal” is actu-
ally closer to a socialist than an actual
“liberal.” Europe actually has us beat
on this; socialists there aren’t afraid to
describe themselves as such instead of
using vague terms like “the left” or in-
accurate ones like “liberal.”

Another word for what we’d call
a “liberal” today is what should be
called a “progressive,” which would
be the opposite of a “conservative,”
who would want things to stay as they
are. But “progressive” is rarely used
because you can ﬁnd many people in
both major political parties who would
fall under that label, so it gets too com-
plicated for pundits to understand and
explain.

Going back to “the right” and label-
ing, why are those who favor outlaw-
ing abortion automatically put into the
category of “the right?” The left-right
spectrum of labeling is supposed to
be based on economic principals, not

when you think life ends and begin.
Religious beliefs should have little ef-
fect on economic ones. If people are
religious wouldn’t you expect them to
favor economic programs that help the
poor? Not in this country.

If there are any labels we need to
retire, they are the “pro-life“ and “pro-
choiee” labels. No sane person is actu-
ally against life, they just have a dif-
ferent idea of what life means. Nor is
any reasonable person against women
“choosing"; they just don‘t think that
certain things are up to choice. Using
either of these labels to describe your-
selfirnplies that those who believe dif-
ferently than you are against what you
are “pro.” That. as has been proven
time again, leads to absolutely no pos-
sible resolution.

The “neo-con” is my favorite mis-
nomer. l have no idea how radically
new thinking individuals can be con-
sidered “conservative" just because

their economic views are almost to
the right of Adam Smith. These people
want to completely change the world,
for better or worse, and yet they’re
“conservative.” This would only make
sense to the pundits who get paid to
talk about politics on TV and radio.

Mislabeling is an international
trend apparently. People call the Ven-
ezuelan government “populist” while
it’s pushing the countriy’s workers and
students to spend an hour a day study-
ing Trotsky. President Chavez for his
part calls his socialist ideas a “Bolivar-
ian Revolution,” naming it after a rich
noble who had nothing to do with so-
cialism or the lower class. How about
we call a spade a spade and a commu-
nist a communist?

Politicians should start labeling
themselves correctly and demanding
they be labeled more accurately. Who
knows, maybe that way we could actu-
ally know who we are voting for.

still disproportionate

I wish to commend staff writer Grace
Wang for her comprehensive and bal-
anced article on FDR requirements in
the revised curriculum, which was pub-

I need, however, to correct informa-
tion that I furnished to Ms. Wang for the

article.

In backing up the assertion that the
reduction in the number of credits in
FDRs was disproportionately large, I
stated erroneously that they were to be
cut by twelve from the current general-
education requirements. The correct
number is nine. Required credits in the
combined areas of literature, ﬁne arts,
history, philosophy, and religion (plus a
few courses from other disciplines) will
be reduced by six; required credits in

When you have two articles left in
your illustrious career as a spring term
Phi writer, you are faced with a choice:
what theorist is suitable to deliver the
ﬁnal bang, and - far worse — which
ones do you cut out.

Should you describe your ﬁrst love
affair with radical theory and German
anarchism in the form of Max Stimer,
or perhaps choose the power-couple of
Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe,
whose main work is titled something

as un-American as Hegemony and So-

cialist Strategy?

lnstead I have chosen something
that has a slight chance of resonating
with you, my dear reader: the recently
deceased Jean Baudrillard.

Coming out of the tradition of Emile
Durkheim and Georges Bataille, Bau-
drillard has written a number of books
on the subject of mass communication

Majority, and The Gulf War didn't take
place.

According to Baudrillard the mod-
ern society has lost the reciprocal
human relation, mainly through the
spread of mass communication.

Where humans used to relate phys-
ically to all aspects of their lives, we
have now become individualized and
detached.

We receive our news completely
alone.

The mundane world has complete-
ly conquered the spectacle and the “sa-
cred” and instead replaced them with
the non-event.

The “sacred” is the events where
a group of humans transcend the pro-
fane world and perform a ritual, as in
religious gatherings.

According to Baudrillard these
don’t exist anymore as everything

SUBSCRIPTION

We don’t truly know if anything
is really happening, but are left to the
non-events of the news.

Baudrillard calls it “the explosion
of information, and the implosion of
knowledge” because everyday we are
bombarded with developing stories on
CNN that are empty of meaning.

The world becomes hyper-real in
the sense that we can see and experi-
ence things that are impossible and is
described as “obsccne".

Everything becomes pornography
as we get close-ups and resolutions
that are beyond reality. We are per-
mitted into societies and situations in
which we have nothing invested.

I, for example, have experienced
a hundred divorces already through
movies and all of us first lost our vir-
ginity on the screen.

Technological fascination keeps

Baudrillard got especially in the
spot light when he claimed the 9/ 11
attacks were the return of the event,
of the “sacred”. This was a singular-
ity that suddenly meant something and
a complete reversal of the Western
Power.

Needless to say, Baudrillard wasn’t
the most popular man around, for a va-
riety of reasons:

First of all, his style is excessive
and poetic, which doesn’t ﬁt in well
with the academics. Second, all of his
statement are unbacked and exagger-
ated, a strategy on his part.

Baudrillard believed that theory
is meant to challenge reality, not de-
scribe it, for once a theory is generally
accepted is disappears and is now a
part of contemporary society.

Pushing reality to the extreme is
the job of the theorist.

the social sciences lowered by three.

This mistake on my part does not al-
ter the fact that the cuts were dispropor-
tionate (especially in the humanities) be-
cause the total number of credits needed
to graduate was cut by only six, and
FDR credits account for less than half
of the total. In light of the fact that the
required “core curriculum” will shrink
for members of the incoming class of
2011, I do hope that they and those who
follow them will use their electives to
broaden their horizons and acquire a di-

verse, well rounded education.

Sorting out the Democratic candidates

The Democratic Presidential race heats up with eight candidates in the ring,
but the big three is popularity is apparent in polls and fundraising contributions

ByWes Llttle
COLUMNIST

*Editor’s note.‘ Wes Little is
the political chairman for the
2008 Mock Convention. *

With Spring Kickoff coming
soon, I would like to give you a
clearer picture of what is happen-
ing in the Democratic Presidential
race our Convention will focus on
correctly forecasting.

I will be back soon with an
analysis of the Republican race,
and I appreciate any questions/
comments you might have on my
views.

These past few weeks have
been busy ones in the race for
the 2008 Democratic presidential
nomination.

The diverse group of seven
Democratic contenders has been
traveling across the nation to raise
funds and build support for their
candidacies.

These efforts are being reﬂect-
ed by the many changes we have
seen in each candidates stand-
ings in the polls and the amount
of money they were able to raise
in the ﬁrst quarter of this year.

These two pieces of informa-
tion have given us new insight
into the current status of the Dem-
ocratic race.

Using these statistics and gaug-
ing each candidate's independent
momentum in the important states
of Iowa, New Hampshire, South
Carolina and Nevada, the “stand-
ings” of the Democratic race be-
come clearer.

l. Sen. Hillary Clinton
The former First Lady and cur-
rent senator from New York pos-

Senators Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama,
and John Edwards lead in the big three
while others try to thrust themselves into

the Democratic presidential spotlight.
 

sesses several huge advantages in
this race: an experienced team of
loyal advisors, a huge and dedi-
cated fund-raising base, and the
support of one of the most popu-
lar Democrats alive, her husband.

Clinton is currently leading
most national polls with about 34
percent and led all Democratic
candidates by raising $26 million
in the ﬁrst quarter of this year.

2. Sen. Barack Obama

What this young Illinois sena-
tor lacks in experience and cam-
paign infrastructure is far exceed-
ed by his phenomenal speaking
gifts, personal dynamism and
ability to connect with voters
across the political and economic
spectrum.

He proved his draw from di-
verse people with his surprisingly
large $25 million fund-raising
haul in the ﬁrst quarter of this
year from an incredible 83,000
contributors.

Obama is presently polling
slightly behind Clinton nation-
ally, with about a 28 percent share
of the Democratic electorate.

3. Sen. John Edwards

Rounding out the “big three”
candidates, Edwards has succeed-
ed in gaining the support of many
Democrats through his populist

message, which will likely play
well in Iowa, a state where many
polls ﬁnd him ahead of the com-
petition.

Edwards’ popularity is evi-
denced by his healthy poll num-
bers in the low teens and his
successful efforts in raising $14
million this quarter.

4. Gov. Bill Richardson

The former ambassador to
the UN. and current governor of
New Mexico has the best resume
in the race and needs to perform
well in the upcoming debates in
order to move into the “ﬁrst tier”
and increase his chances of be-
coming the nation’s ﬁrst Hispanic
president.

Despite Gov. Richardson’s
struggles to ﬁnd any traction in
national polls (usually receiving
only 2-4 percent), he led the “sec-
ond tier” in fund-raising with $6
million and is seen as the stron-
gest challenger to Clinton, Obama
and Edwards.

5. Sen. Joe Biden

If this veteran senator from
Delaware can avoid his seem-
ingly constant gaffes and political
missteps, his extensive national
security credentials might gain
him attention in this race.

However, Biden raised a rath-

er unimpressive $3 million and
usually manages only 1 percent
in polls.

6. Sen. Chris Dodd

This Connecticut senator des-
perately needs a string of good
press or strong fund-raising to
keep his campaign from becom-
ing irrelevant.

While Dodd raised a respect-
able $4 million, he is virtually
unknown to the American people
and will most likely stay that
way.

7 & 8. Rep. Dennis Kucinich and
Sen. Mike Grave

Both this liberal Ohio repre-
sentative and former Alaska sena-
tor have already become irrel-
evant and both failed to raise any
signiﬁcant amount of campaign
cash.

Student volunteers excite the
montessori school children
with afternoon puppet festival

By Jess Ramos
STAFF WRITER

Colorful puppets and chil-
dren’s smiles shone bright at the
Children’s Puppet Festival held at
Washington and Lee University
last Saturday.

Woods Creek Montessori
sponsored the puppet festival as a
fundraiser and part of its ongoing
15“‘ anniversary celebration.

Following Dr. Maria Montes-
sori’s philosophy, Woods Creek
Montessori seeks to recognize
and respect the human personal-
ity in each child.

Since 1992, the Montessori
school has provided an alterna-
tive source of early education for
Rockbridge-area children.

The festival featured a range
of activities for children between
the ages of two and eight, from
making their own puppets to face
painting.

Brightly colored tents and bal-
loons amidst ch.i1dren’s laughter
on Cannan Green created a fun
and whimsical atmosphere for the
participants.

Stackhouse Theater became an
African jungle for the aﬂemoon
when Barefoot Puppets, a Rich-
mond-based puppet company,
performed adaptations of West-
African folktales.

Children and parents enjoyed
puppet performances of two

Ashanti folktales, “Tug-of-War”
and “A Story, A Story.” Using
humorous puns and rod puppets,
Barefoot Puppets entertained the
audience members.

The ﬁrst performance, “Tug-
of-War,” is about a hippopota-
mus and an elephant engaged in a
battle of wits. “A Story, A Story”
follows the spider Anansi as he
obtained a box of stories from the
Sky-God.

“It’s a good connection too——a lot
of the students do work with us,”
said Sullivan.

Recently, on Nabors’ Spring
Service Day, members of the Na-
bors Service League made pup-
pets that were used in the festi-
val.

In addition to hosting the festi-
val, W&L students helped coordi-

  
  
  
   
   
   
    

“Its been exciting. All the kids have been
interesting.  Its for a good cause. ”

Though the festival was origi-
nally for young children, plenty
of W&L students who are young
at heart came out as well.

Jessica Sullivan, Woods Creek
Montessori Administrative Assis-

tant, was greatful for W&L’s in—.

volvement in the Children’s Pup-
pet Festival. “It’s so great to have
[W&L] students helping out.”

Sullivan highlighted W&L’s

Woods Creek Montessori. Ac-
cording to Sullivan, many W&L
faculty enroll their young chil-
dren at the school.

Also, W&L journalism stu-
dents previously created a pro-

nate outdoor craft and facepaint-
ing stations and then helped clean
up afterwards.

Freshman Gozi Egbuonu oper-
ated the face painting station. “lt’s
been exciting,” she said. “All the
kids have been interesting.”

Woods Creek Montessori con-
tacted her sorority, Pi Beta Phi,
about volunteering, and Egbuonu
decided to volunteer. “It’s for a
good cause,” she said.

The Children’s Puppet Fes-
tival was a success, according
to Sullivan and Egbuonu. “lt’s a
good way to raise money—it lets
the kids have fun while helping
the school,” said Egbuonu.

Women’s Tennis three wins from title

Continued from page 6

If the Generals defeat Middlebury on Tuesday, they will take on
the winner of the Pomona-Pitzer/Williams quarterﬁnal. W&L faced
both schools at the Fab Five Tournament in San Antonio earlier in the
season, but with drastically different results. After defeating Pomona-
Pitzer 8-0 on the ﬁrst day of the tournament, the Generals suffered their
only defeat of the season to the Ephs of Williams, 5-4. Last season,
the Generals defeated Williams 5-0 in the quarterﬁnals of the NCAA
tournament.

Of the teams on the other side of the bracket that the Generals could
face in the ﬁnals, W&L has played half. The Generals defeated Denison
8-1 at home early in the season and won on the road against Sewanee
6-3 in the middle of April. The Generals did not play Amherst or Gus-
tavus Adolphus this season. Perennial rival, Emory University, lost in
the third round to Sewanee, and No. l DePauw lost to Denison, also in
the third round.

If the Generals are able to win three more matches, they would join
the 1988 men’s tennis team as just the second W&L team to bring home
a national title.

Sophomore Stacy Doombos
won the May Day Multi Hep-
tathlon held at VMI and im-
proved her national qualifying
score this weekend.

In just her third heptathlon
ever, Doombos scored 4448
points, which, pending other re-
sults from the weekend, would
be the eighth-highest Division
,III score this year;

“Coach Hoey and I talked
about me doing the Hep[tathlon]
last year, but since there were a
lot of events I had to learn, we
just didn’t really have time‘ to
practice all of them,” Doombos

sPoRTs EDITOR

After just missing winning
the ODAC Championship, the
men’s golf team still held out
hope that they would receive
an at-large bid to the national
tournament. When the selec-
tions were released on May 7,
the team was left on the outside
looking in. However, junior Na-
thaniel James was one of ﬁve
players selected as an individual
to compete at the tournament.

In order to determine the
ﬁeld, the selection committee
ﬁrst determines which teams
will compete. Twenty-four
teams of the 35 team ﬁeld are
automatically chosen based on
winning a conference champi-
onship. The next eight spots are

_ reserved for teams that are either

true independents or playing in a

said.

“This year we started earlier
with new events like the 100 hur-
dles, javelin, and the shot. Since
I have always done so many dif-
ferent events, I always thought it
would be fun to try.”

In addition to improving in
every event from her decathlon
at Liberty, Doornbos set heptath-
lon personal records in all four
of the ﬁrst day events.

She ran the 100m hurdles in
16.24 seconds, cleared 5’1” in
the high jump, threw the shot put
just over 31 feet, and ﬁnished the
200m dash in 26.17 seconds.

On day two, Doombos long
jumped over 17 feet and threw
the javelin over 84 feet, which

conference that does not receive
automatic bid. That leaves only
three spots for teams who did not
win their conference title. This
year those spots were taken by
Oglethorpe, McMurray, and Il-
linois Wesleyan.

Only after completing the
selection of the teams does the
committee look at individual
players.

“The selection process for
Nationals is pretty complicated
as far as I can tell,” said James.

“They chose the best ﬁve in-
dividuals whose teams had not
been chosen. I think they look
primarily at scoring average and
head to head records against oth-
er players.”

Joining James as an indi-
vidual will be ODAC rival Bob
Boykin of Hampden-Sydney.

' The national tournament
is different because there is a

gave her a chance to jump up
the national performance list if
she could run a fast 800. Several
teammates came out to cheer
her on as she ran the 800m in
2:22.22.

“I really am enjoying all of
the events and don’t really have
a least favorite,” said Doombos.
“I am really enjoying the 800,
100 hurdles, shot put, and jave-
lin, since they are all new events
for me, so each time I am getting
more experienced and better at
them. Then the long jump, high
jump, and 200 are events I have
always done, so I really enjoy
those as well.”

Though the oﬂicial selections
will not be announced until Sun-

much larger ﬁeld than any of the
regular season events. With 180
players, the event is about twice
the size of the average regular
season tournament. Even though
the tournament is similar in for-
mat to the regular season because
it uses four rounds of stroke play,
there is a out after round two
which reduces the ﬁeld to the top
17 teams and ﬁve individuals.

“There is a little more pres-
sure associated with a touma-
ment of this size,” said James.
“However, for me anyway, most
of the pressure comes during the
regular season as we are trying
to make it to the NCAAS. Now
that I’m in, I am freed up to just
go play.”

James also made the national
tournament as an individual last
season where he was +24 over
the four rounds, good enough for
34th.

Athletes prepare for trips to NCAA nationals

Despite heptathalon inexperience, Doornbos is leaving her mark

day, May 20, at 1 p.m, Doom-
bos’ score all but guarantees her
a spot in the heptathlon ﬁeld at
the National Championships.

“My goal at the national meet
is to do the best I can do and
make sure to be ready to com-
pete the day of the meet,” said
Doombos.

“I would love to be in the top
eight and make all-American,
but mainly my goal is to bring it
the day of the meet, because all
the past meets don’t matter when
you get there. It is all about how
you do that day.”

The meet will be held May
24-26 in Titan Stadium at the
University of Wisconsin-Osh
Kosh.

James represents W&L at NCAA golf nationals for the second year in a row

“I feel much better prepared
this year than I did last year,”
said James. “I was a little too
caught up in the excitement of
being at Nationals last year. I'm
very excited this year as well,
but since I know what it is like
to compete in that environment
I should be better able to handle
the mental side of playing on
that stage. I’ve also done well
in other large tournaments since
last year’s NCAA’s, so that adds
some conﬁdence as well.

“The ﬁrst goal is to make the
cut,” said James when asked
about his goals for the touma-
ment. “If I can’t do that, all the
other goals aren’t worth much.
The main plan, however, is to
win. Not quite sure how that goal
is going to pan out just yet.”

Lax surprises Salisbury’

Women take early lead but can ’t hold on against No. 2 team in the nation

By Kevin Corn
STAFF wnman

The women’s lacrosse team
ﬁnished their season this past
week with a 14-4 victory over
the College of Wooster and a 10-
7 loss to No. 2 ranked Salisbury
University.

In the ﬁrst round of the 2007
Division III NCAA’s Women’s
Lacrosse Tournament, the Gener-
als hosted the Wooster Fighting
Scots. Aiding the Generals in their
decisive victory were sophomore
Colleen Evans with four goals and
senior Kelly Evans, who scored
twice and had three assists.

‘ Seniors Karina Schless and
Mallory Lobisser each recorded
two goals apiece, while Britten
Mathews, Kelsi Robinson and ju-
niors Laura Henson and Christine
Bender scored one point each.

Maggie Megear added a pair
of assists while Schless had one.
Junior Sarah Tilbor recorded ﬁve
saves in goal, while sophomore
Ali Hillyard made one additional
stop. ‘

Tennis takes aim at title '

During the match,’ W&L was
first to score, jumping to a 4-0 lead
in the ﬁrst few minutes. Wooster
started to make a comeback with
two goals to cut the Generals’
lead, but the Generals went on to
score four unanswered points by
halftime to make the score 8-2.

In the second half, the Fight-
ing Scots were ﬁrst to score, but
the Generals made six goals be-
fore the ﬁnal buzzer to win 14-4.
After the game, Lobisser said,
“We capitalized on every opportu-
nity we were given in that game.
Wooster played a zone-style de-
fense which we easily exploited.
I think they come from a weaker
conference so we shocked them
with our higher level of play. We
played as a team and put the goal
in the net every chance we got.”

Saturday, the Generals traveled
to Salisbury, Maryland to take _on
the nation’s second ranked team.
Washington and Lee’s seven
points came from Megan Slos—
son who scored twice, and Col-
leen Evans, Kelly Evans, Avery
Lovejoy, Megear and Robinson,

who all scored once. Assists were
made by Lovejoy, Robinso, and
Slosson.

Sarah Tilbor made thirteen
saves in her 56 and a half minutes
ofplay, while Ali Hillyard played
for three and a half minutes. Hill-
yard had to come into the game
because Tilbor was hit with a yel-
low card.

In the ﬁrst ten minutes ofplay,
W&L grabbed a 3-1 lead over
Salisbury.

But the Sea Gulls charged back
as Stephanie Shores ignited a four
goal run with eighteen minutes to
go in the half.

With eleven minutes left in the
half, the Generals were down 5-3,
but they rallied to take a 5-5 tie
into halftime.

During the second half, both
teams scored once, and then Salis-
bury’s Shores and Natalie Degele
scored to give the Sea Gulls a 9-6
lead with almost twenty minutes
left in the game.

W&L’s Slosson scored once
more to bring the score to 9-7.
However, the Generals were un-

able to make it past the Sea Gulls’

defenders for the rest of the game,

leaving them with a 10-7 loss.
Lobisser said afterwards, “We

played amazing against Salis-"Q

bury. There was a point in the
game when I thought, ‘wow, we
are going to beat the number 2
team in the country.’ We were up
by 2 goals at one point and just
couldn’t hold on. The Salisbury
team grossly under-estimated us
and I think we shocked them in
the ﬁrst few minutes. This team, if
we play smart, can beat anyone.”
Lobisser went on to comment

about the season as a whole: “I.

think we had an unbelievable sea-
son. The depth and heart of this
team surpassed that of past teams
and I honestly thought this was
our year.

“No. 1 Franklin and Marshal
has said that we were their tough-
est competition all season and we
would have loved the opportu-
nity to play them again. Overall,
I couldn’t have asked for a better
senior season.”

Women look to cap an amazing season with national team championship, while
Applegate and Wortham are selected to play in individual singles championship

By Mlchael Keenan
SPORTS emron

After defeating Swarthmore
College and the University of
Mary‘ Washington on their home
court, the Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team travels to
the nearby Battleground Complex
in Fredericksburg, Va., to take on
Middlebury in the-quarterﬁnals of
the national championship.

“Being at Mary Washington,
only two and a half hours away,
we are hoping it will allow some
people to road trip out to watch
and support us during our match-
es,” said junior Leah Weston. “We
believe we have a home court ad-
vantage, and having people come
support us at our matches could
be beneﬁcial in helping us step it
up."

W&L has been selected to
compete in the national touma-
ment every year since 1994.

“Nationals have a completely
different feel from the regular
season,” said sophomore Katie
Tabb. “The ﬁrst couple rounds of
nationals that we play at home are
great, but even that doesn’t com-
pare to the last rounds at another
location.

“Being at Mary Washington, only two and a half

hours away, we are hoping it will allow some

people to...support us during our matches. ’

- Junior Leah Weston

J

“It’s much more exciting to
leave home and feel like you’re
participating in something that’s
a big deal. 1 think the added ex-
citement of the last few rounds is
really what we work for all sea-
son.
In the last 13 NCAA to_uma-
ments, the Generals have ﬁnished
fourth twice, third three times,
and been runners up four times,
including three of the past four
years, but they have yet to win it
all. However, the players down-
played any pressure to ﬁnish ﬁrst.

“Our goals for the team tour-
nament are just to play our best,
win as many of our matches as we
can and most importantly to have
fun,” said Weston. “We are going
to play our best if we relax and
have fun and hopefully this will
allow us to be successful through-
out the rest of the tournament.”

“It’s not really about winning,

92

I don’t think,” said Tabb. “I think
if we can go out there and end
our season saying ‘Regardless of
the results this year, win or lose,
we played the best we could, we
fought until the end, and we had
a lot of ﬁm together.’ That’s what
really makes our season a suc-
cess.”

The Generals are led by se-
niors Emily Applegate and Ginny
Wortham. Both players were se-
lected to compete in the 32 player
individual singles championship,
which will be held following the
team tournament, May 18-20.
Tabb was selected as an alternate
and would compete should a com-
petitor become unable to compete.
On the doubles side, the team of
Applegate and Kristen McClung
was one of 16 pairs selected for
the doubles tournament.

The team includes a range of
upperclassmen and freshmen.

“I think every player on the
team is experienced in their own
way,” said Tabb. “There are some
girls who have played at nation-

als every year since their fresh-_,.-b

men year, and there are others for
whom this is their ﬁrst year, but
they have a lot of junior experi-
ence, which I actually think will
end up serving them better in the
pressure situations. The bottom
line is, our team is very deep, and
one reason is because we all know
what to do when we get out there;
we have a lot of drive.”
Middlebury came into the
tournament boasting an 11-4 re-
cord. The Panthers are led by
Amy Roche, who was the NES-

CAC Player of the Year and has’

been selected to compete in both
the individual singles and doubles
national tournaments. To get to
the quarterﬁnals, the quarterﬁ-
nals, Middlebury defeated Vassar
College and Bowdoin College.

Like the Generals, the Pan-
thers have yet to drop a match
in the tournament. In the NCAA
tournament two years ago, the
Generals faced the Panthers in the
national semiﬁnals and emerged
victorious by a score of 5-3.
