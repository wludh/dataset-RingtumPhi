verthe past ﬁve years,
the Williams Invest-
ment Society (WIS)
has outperformed
approximately 85 percent of
professional fund managers and
generated close to $1 million for
Washington and Lee University.

“The group has consistently
beaten the standard benchmark,
the S&P 500, which is really re-
markable.” said Executive Direc-
tor of WIS Peter Lawrence. “It’s
something that most head fund-
managers can ’t do.”

The Williams Investment So-
ciety is a student-run organization
that invests a portion of the uni-
versity’s endowment. When the
group began in February 1998, it
started out with $1 million. At its
lowest point, the endowment was
valued at $662,000.

But, in just over four years, the
value of the money invested has
reached $1.6 million. Last year,
the group perfomied in the 98th
percentile of professional man-
agers, which faculty advisor and
Business Administration profes-
sor Scott Hoover called “down-
right astounding.”

Hoover credits the group’s
long-temi success to their will-
ingness to take risks. “They have
a lack of bias that you see in a
lot of fund managers,” he said.
“They don’t particularly care if
they lose the money. Its not their
money and it’s not going to make
or break the university, which al-
lows them to invest in things that
may be riskier.”

The soCiety’s choice to invest
in Sealed Air Corporation is a
prime example. The corporation
had a lawsuit against it, which
would have prevented most fund
managers from even thinking
about buying stock in the com-
pany. However, after investigat-
ing the claims against the com-
pany, the W&L students decided
that the lawsuit had no merit and
bought stock in the company. The
gamble paid off.

“The group doubled their
money in a month,” said Hoover.
“But the reason they were able to
do that was because there were
no repercussions if they were
wrong.”

Lawrence also praised the
group’s remarkable success, but
he attributed their success rate to
two factors: the members’ ability
to remain detached from specific
stocks as well as sheer luck.

“One problem portfolio man-
agers have is that they get at-
tached to stocks,” said Lawrence.
“The high rate of member tum-
over means that you have a fresh
pair of eyes to look at the stocks
and decide ifit‘s time to sell."

Just last week, WIS selected
18 new members. These 18 were
chosen out of 64 applicants. As
part of the application. candidates
have to complete a buy-sell pre-
sentation, where they say “this is
what we want to buy” and “this is
what we want to sell.”

“The application itself serves
as a screening process,” said As-
sociate Director Paul Cobuzzi.
“We look at the amount of re-
search, time, and thought they put
into it.”

WIS versus the S&P 500:

1 Return for WIS
Return for S&P 500

 

Yum

The Williams Investment Society has anually outperformed the S&P 500, the standard Industry benchmark

Out of the 64 applications,
a little over half were chosen to
be interviewed. In the interview,
applicants were questioned about
recent ﬁnancial news. teamwork
and what they wrote on their ap-
plication. Not only were they ex-
pected to know about the current
ﬁnancial markets. but they were
expected to have attended previ-
ous WIS meetings and be willing
to make a big time commitment.
"The most important thing for
us was enthusiasm." said Law-
rence. “You have to be willing to
devote a lot of time to the group
outside of your other organiza-
tions."
Out of the 64 applicants. only
10 were women. Because they
received so few female applica-
tions. the directors are making an

effort to generate more interest
among females as well as other
minorities on campus.

“We‘ve recently emailed the
presidents of sororities and the
head of MSA [Multicultural Stu-
dent Association] and are trying
to reach out to other areas on cam-
pus that are not told enough about
it," said Cobuzzi. “We want them
to know that women are a part of
WIS and certainly contribute.”

Associate Director Lauren
Morea is planning a WIS Wom-
en‘s Night, which is aimed at
women who haven”t come to WIS
meetings but might be interested.

“The group would be stronger
if there was a more diverse set of
people," said Hoover. “You want
a set of different people and you
don ‘t just want C-School ma-

jors.”

While the society is--from
both the faculty and students’ per-
spectives--educational, the WIS
offers many other beneﬁts.

“It provides intangible experi-
ence,” said Lawrence. “It’s a great
source of education and satisfac-
tion as well as a source of attract-
ing students to the school.”

The countless hours that the
members spend each week re-
searching stocks to buy and sell
seem to pay off. According to
Hoover, several members of the
society will go on to jobs at some
of the country’s best investment
ﬁrms.

“[The Williams Investment
Society] is interview training 101
for ﬁnance jobs,” said Hoover. “It
really pays off in the job market.”

Holbrooke offers ideas on Iraq

Former diplomat shares his analysis on Iraq and other issues during Institute for Honor

By Jacob Gelger
MANAGING EDITOR

istinguished diplo-
mat Richard Hol-
brooke told the sixth
Institute for Honor
that the United States must work
to understand and solve the clear
cultural clash between extreme
Islam and the rest of the world.

Speaking in Lee Chapel on Fri-
day morning, Holbrooke outlined
his understanding of America’s
post-Cold War foreign policy and
extensively discussed the ongo-
ing war in Iraq.

“This is a worse situation
than Vietnam,” Holbrooke told
the crowd of students, alumni
and members of the Lexington
community. “The post-Cold War
world is full of dozens of long
submerged problems that were al-
ways there but stayed buried dur-
ing the Cold War.”

Holbrooke said far more peo-
ple live in free nations than in

1988, but he noted that formerly »

hidden feuds and problems were
now erupting.

A career diplomat, Holbrooke
started his Foreign Service career
in Vietnam. The journalism ma-
jor and former editor of Brown
University’s newspaper said he
joined the State Department al-
most by accident.

“My best friend growing up
was David Rusk,” Holbrooke
said. “His father was appointed
Secretary of State by Kennedy,
and suddenly I knew a famous
person. He’d talked to us about
joining the Foreign Service during
a career day during high school.”

Holbrooke returned home from
a State Department post in Viet-
nam and became Jimmy Carter’s
Assistant Secretary of State for
the Far East. During Bill Clin-
t0n’s ﬁrst term Holbrooke served
as Assistant Secretary of State for
Europe, and Clinton later named
him the U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations.

While discussing the situation
in Iraq, Holbrooke said the rein-

“Iraq will determine
everything... if it im-
proves people will
pull back and say we
should stick with it. ”

RICHARD HOLBROOKE, U.S. diplomat

forcements being sent into Bagh-
dad would not end the war.

“Iraq is the great crisis of our
times,” he said. “I worry that an
Iraq backlash will cause us to pull
back from our international obli-
gations, and we’ve seen this cycle
before in U.S. history.”

As W&L prepares for the 2008
Mock Convention, Holbrooke
said the war will dramatically
shape the coming elections.

“Iraq will be the dominant is-
sue as both parties choose candi-
dates,” the diplomat said. “[John]

McCain's decision to support
the war is costing him popular-
ity. McCain decided to support
Bush even though he hates him.
[Nebraska Senator] Chuck Hagel
is old friends with McCain. They
are both decorated Vietnam veter-
ans. and now they are barely talk-
ing to each other because of the
war.“

Holbrooke said that Hillary
Clinton has been the Democrat
least willing to attack Bush, while
John Edwards was calling for
an immediate withdrawal, and

 

Barack Obania is taking a posi-
tion somewhere between the two
of them.

‘‘We‘ll know the nominees
in 13 months," Holbrooke said.
“Iraq will determine everything...
if it improves people will pull
back and say we should stick with
it. But if it gets worse, things will
depend on which nominees win.”

Emeritus professor John Gunn
said Ilolbrooke provided‘ an ex-
cellent introduction for the con-
ference‘s later discussions.

“What matters most is not
military or economic power, but
the values and ideals  of what
we believe make a stable and just
society," Gunn said. “[We need
a] recognition of diversity and ac-
ceptance of different values.”

Bob Feagin, a member of the
class of 1960 who helped orga-
nize the Institute for Honor, said
the Institute chose Holbrooke
because it wanted a speaker who
would attract attention to the pro-
gram and its values.

“His topic is something that

is on the table today. We want to
discuss values that we think have
relevance,” Feagin said.

After concluding his speech,
Holbrooke said W&L students
should consider a career in the
Foreign Service.

“It’s a great career,” he said,
“but I’d encourage you to start
young...too many people start at
the age of 30.”

Holbrooke said the current
generation of college students was
not matching the involvement of
his baby boom contemporaries.

“My generation was much
more involved in public atfairs.
The baby boomers were engaged
much more than your genera-
tions.”

As Feagin leﬁ Friday’s lun-
cheon and headed to his ﬁrst
seminar, he explained what his
classmates hoped to achieve at
the Institute.

“We wanted to take W&L
ideals beyond here and into the
world. . .into the corporate board-
room and diplomatic discussion.”

sing America’s
respect for teachers

If teachers are so inﬂuential, why are they treated badly?

By Jess Steinmetz
C 0 LU M N I S T

Why would you want to
waste all your schooling and
potential on a job like that?

After hearing such criticism
from family and friends over
Christmas break about my cho-
sen career path, one might think
I decided to be a cashier at Wal-
Mart or a hairdresser.

While nothing is wrong with
either of those jobs, it would be
fair to say that four years of es-
say writing and test taking at a
reputable university would not
greatly improve my competency
at either of these jobs.

On the contrary, since I want
to teach government to high
school students after I graduate,
my politics major and teacher
education training here at Wash-
ington and Lee will be a great
help to me. .

You would think that with
the current state of education in
the United States, people would
want highly qualiﬁed individuals
teaching adolescents about our
government so they would have

. the background to make well-

informed decisions on Election
Day. Instead, people have told
me time and time again that if I
wanted to be a teacher I should
have just gone to a community
college.

Why do teachers have such
a lack of respect in today’s so-
ciety? Aren’t teachers the ones

Aren ’t teachers the ones who pre-
pare the next generation to deal with
the problems of the world?

who prepare the next generation
to deal with the problems of the
world?

Don’t they help develop the
minds of the people who will
soon be running our nation?
Aren’t teachers the ones respon-
sible for training individuals for
all future professions?

Does the general public have
such a gross lack of knowledge
about what teaching high school
students encompasses?

Contrary to popular belief,
teaching is not the easy 8a.m. to
3p.m. job with summers off.

Instead, it involves devoting
extra time and attention to plan
lessons relevant to students’
lives that will interest them
enough to truly motivate them.

Good teaching requires hold-
ing high expectations for stu-
dents and putting in the extra
work so they can reach their
potential.

It involves devoting numer-
ous hours after the school day
ofﬁcially ends to write college
recommendation letters, edit
college admission essays, grade
papers, and give advice to stu-
dents who come to ask for help.

In this day and age, it also
involves balancing between the
thin line of preparing students to
pass high—stakes tests (such as
the SOL tests here in Virginia)
without falling into the trap of
simply teaching to the test.

It is bad enough that teachers
are paid next to nothing for all
the hard work they put into their
jobs. Why can’t people whole-
heartedly support those who go
into teaching?

I accept that I will make far
less money than many of my
peers in the years to come, but
I look forward to spending days
in the classroom teaching my
students about the basic struc-
ture of government in American
society. I personally cannot see
any better way to make a differ-
ence than to teach young people
how to critically think about
abortion, gay marriage, terror-
ism, international involvement,
education policy and the various
issues of our day.

If I can deal with the strug-
gles of motivating my students
day after day, why can’t others
deal with my motivation to be a
teacher?

  Schools crack
down on press

Dialogue key for First Amendment protection

Student newspapers and
college administrators seldom
agree about everything, but at
most schools they learn to live
with each other.

This year, however, that
hasn’t always been the case.

Last week Provost Rob-
ert Dixon at Grambling State
University in Monroe, La. an-
nounced that the university’s
student run paper was “sus—
pended” until the end of Janu-

Dixon said that the paper’s
performance during the fall
had been poor and that no
more editions should come out
until the quality improved.

But Darryl Smith, student
editor of The Gramblinite,
said his paper is going to keep
coming out.

That’s exactly the action
he should take.

In Dixon’s defense, The
Gramblinite has had its prob-
lems in the past months. One
of the paper’s sports writers
plagiarized materials from an-
other local newspaper. Dixon
also claims The Gramblin-
ite has not done a good job
checking its facts on some
articles.

Smith has a simple re-

sponse to the fact-checking
allegations. He said his pa-
per cannot check their facts if
administrators will not talk to
his reporters.

Though the paper has made
mistakes, suspending publica-
tion is the wrong course of ac-
tion. How does Dixon expect
improvement if the paper isn’t
publishing?

Student journalists learn
by trial and error. If Dixon
stops the presses after each
error, no improvements will
be made.

Thankfully, Washington
and Lee administrators have
taken a far different course
than their counterparts at
Grambling State. Though
they do not always see eye-to-
eye with the Phi and Trident
on every issue, they respect
each paper’s ﬁrst amendment
rights.

All they ask for in return
is fair and thorough reporting.
That is a request we at the Phi
consider more than reason-
able.

We are committed to get-
ting all the facts, asking all the
necessary questions, and pre-
senting all sides of each story.
And the administration has

responded in kind by opening
up and letting our reporters in
the door.

When we wanted to learn
more about the proposed
Master Plan, Vice President
for Administration Joe Grasso
was more than happy to an-
swer questions. When we
wanted a preview of Inau-
guration Weekend, President
Ruscio took time out of his
hectic schedule and gave us a
Saturday morning interview.

This commitment to co-
operation has not gone un-
noticed. It is obvious that the
dialogue at W&L is far more
frank and open than the con-
versation at Grambling State.
When the student press and
administration disagree, we
sit down to discuss the issue.
When the same disagreement
occurs at Grambling, the pro-
vost tries to shut down the
paper.

If W&L’s administrators
keep holding open and honest
conversations with reporters
from student publications, we
will not face a situation simi-
lar to Grambling’s.

So long as both sides keep
talking, everyone keeps win-
ning.

The demise of democracy

Hugo Chavez is rule by decree for 18 months won ’t help poor as promised

By Abel Delgado
COLU M NIST

If ever there has been a time
when a democracy committed
suicide, it’s now in Venezuela.

Hugo Chavez has done just
about everything within his
power toiturn what was once
one of the few stable countries
in Latin America to the birth-
place of the new and improved
militant left.

The former military ofﬁcer,
who decided to run for president
only after his coup failed and he
was somehow pardoned, has
truly revolutionized Venezuela.

Chavez has done everything
from changing the country’s
name to rewriting its constitu-
tion. Now he gets to rule by de-
cree.

Yes, the joke of a National
Assembly, ﬁlled with Chavez
supporters after opposition par-
ties refused to take part in fraud-
ulent elections, unanimously
approved giving the dictator, I
mean “president”, the authority
to make laws by decree for the
next 18 months.

Whoever believes the period
is going to last only 18 months
is kidding themselves.

Everybody should know by
now that Chavez would like
nothing more than to rule for as
long as and in the same style as
his mentor Fidel Castro.

If you think Chavez might

Everybody should know that Chavez
would like nothing more than to rule
in the same style as Fidel Castro.

use his newly granted powers to
help the poor, as he has repeat-
edly promised, just take a look
at his current objectives.

He plans a government take-
over of the national telecom
company, which he accuses of
spying on him, and shut down
networks which have been
friendly to the opposition.

He also plans to national-
ize the entire ‘energy sector and
forcibly buy at least 51 percent
of all stock in foreign oil com-
panies operating in Venezuela.

Chavez and his “brother” (a
term they often use to describe
themselves) Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are
also planning to push OPEC
to cut oil production, raising
oil prices across the world and
making sure their ridiculous
government programs will be
well-funded.

Right after winning the past
election, Chavez decided itwas
okay to ﬁre his vice president
and consolidate all his “allied”
parties into one party under his
sole control.

He has proclaimed only his
most ardent supporters could
serve in the military or work for
the Venezuelan oil company.

His current term lasts until
2013 but in his weekly ﬁve-hour
long speeches on national tele-
vision, he has more than alluded
to the idea of ruling for a lot lon-
ger, possibly for life.

On the foreign front, Chavez
has built strong alliances with
the aforementioned Iran, China,
and Syria, three of the most re-
pressive regimes in the world.

He has continually meddled
in other Latin American elec-
tions, sometimes causing his
allies to lose and is now calling
for a uniﬁed Latin American
military similar to NATO, only

 

under his control.

He continually threatens to
boot out the U.S. Ambassador
to Venezuela and has already
had to sever relations with a few
Latin American countries.

Anyone who believes all this
is justiﬁed by the help Chavez
has given Venezuela’s poor
should know that, until the oil
boom three years ago, Venezu-
ela was actually getting poorer
under Chavez.

He has used his windfall oil
proﬁts to buy votes right before
elections, fund socialist candi-
dates and visit dictators across
the world.

He has even allegedly fund-
ed the leftist terrorist guerillas
in neighboring Colombia.

Yes, Chavez did win this past
election, no matter how much
its legitimacy could understand-
ably be questioned, but the elec-
tion Venezuela has paradoxical-
ly brought the end of democracy
in Venezuela.

If we are not careful, Chavez
could usher in a terrible age for
the entire hemisphere.

Seniors salutedforfeats  

Meghan Joss and Kelly Evans received national award for accomplishments and campus involvement

By Abrl Nelson
STAFF warren

This fall, two Washington
and Lee seniors reached into
their mailboxes and pulled out
an acceptance letter that they
were not expecting.

The letter detailed an award
for which they had not applied.
It informed them that they had
been selected to be featured in
the annual “Who’s Who Among
Students in American Colleges
and Universities” book.

Meghan J oss turned immedi-
ately to the Internet to ﬁnd out
about the award.

Kelly Evans thought that it
was a joke and threw the letter
away, only to get another from
Dean Dawn Watkins several
months later conﬁrming the fact
that it was a legitimate organi-
zation.

The Who’s Who Among Stu-
dents program was conceptual-
ized in 1933 by Pettus Randall,
then an undergraduate student at
the University of Alabama.

Randall had been invited to

join numerous academic hon-
ors programs and societies, but

he could not commit to any of
them because of membership
dues and initiation fees. Randall
designed an honors program that
would accept students based on
their achievements and allow
them membership for free.

Students would be featured in
a book detailing their biographi-
cal information which would
be sent to potential employers
around the country.

The program was expanded
in 1966 to include junior col-
leges and still publishes a book
about exceptional college stu-
dents each year.

Campus nominating com-
mittees select 50 students each
fall and send their information
to the organization for ﬁnal se-
lection.

As a high school student,
Joss,said that she had a check-

to repeat tenth grade as a result
of severe health issues from an
eating disorder.

“The only way I could stay

Doing Everything, and
Loving It

Evans, a native of Lexington,
was recruited at W&L to play
lacrosse. She came with plans
to get involved in much more.

She especially wanted to be a
member of the University Cho-
rus, participate in the theater
department and be involved the
planning committees for Fancy
Dress or Mock Convention. But
plans changed for her, too.

She found that between her
lacrosse schedule, studying
abroad for a year and her major
in business journalism that she
was unable to ﬁt many things
into her schedule that did not
coincide with her major or her
sport.

“It’s almost like it all hap-
pened by accident,” she said.
“I’m deﬁnitely one of those
people who wants to do every-
thing, and I always end up bit-
ing off more than I can chew.”

She tried to write for The
Trident for most of her ﬁrst two
years of school, but was not
very involved until this year
when she was named co-editor
with junior Will Chamberlain.

She has also served as an
ESOL tutor, the chair of the
Freshman Orientation Commit-
tee, a tour guide and participated
in W&L Student Consulting.

“I feel like I’ve gotten so
much out of this place that it’s
nice to give something in re-
turn,” Evans said. “I feel an ob-
ligation to hold up my end of the
bargain and give back.”

Evans, was able to attend
W&L as a George Washington
Honors Scholar.

W&L also helped her to get a
coveted internship with the Wall
Street Journal this summer and
one with Reuters last summer.

She was also inducted into
the Omicron Delta Kappa soci-
ety on Founder’s Day.

“Too many people don’t do
things because they think they
aren’t qualiﬁed,” Evans said.

“It’s nice to be able to look
back fondly. I had a blast, and
it’s time to move on.”

Sophomore Chris Rucker, senior Frank Lee iii and freshmen Joseph Roane, Kenneth Hopkins and Zaq Lawai clinch the first place trophy last Friday night during Lip Sync. .

By Sarah Kientz
STAFF wnmzn

In addition to being an ex-
tremely successful charity event,
the annual Lip Sync competi-
tion, which took place on Friday
night, is often thought to be one
of the most entertaining nights of
the year. The audience saw that
anything goes when fraternities
and sororities have their pledges
perform. However, the winning
group this year was not from a
Greek house, but from the Multi-
cultural Students Association.

Though fellow members attri-
bute the choreography of MSA’s
dance to freshman Zaq Lawal, he
said it was a group effort.

“Everyone put in an equal
amount of work and came up with
choreography,” Lawal said with a
smile. “Jumping over four other
guys—not my idea.”

Lawal said he and the other
members of the group, freshmen
Kenneth Hopkins and Joseph
Roane, senior Frank Lee III and
sophomore Chris Rucker, prac-
ticed the dance for about an hour
and a half each day starting the
Sunday before the performance.

The group decided to use a
medley of songs the crowd would
love.

Lawal said that classics like
‘NSYNC’s “Bye Bye Bye” and
Sisq<')’s “Thong Song” were two
crowd favorites the group knew

A the audience would react to.

,Lawal added that MSA already
has some ideas for next year’s
Lip Sync, but they are waiting for
new songs to come up before they
make any ﬁnal decisions.

Runner-up was awarded to one
of Kappa Alpha Theta’s groups
of freshmen pledges. According

“I know people are there to see friends act like

idiots on stage, but at the end of the day, if thats

what raises $14,000, the end justiﬁes the means. ’

I

TRIPP ONNEN, Advisor to SARAH
 

to freshman Elizabeth Micci, the
group also began working on its
performance the Sunday before
Lip Sync, and put in over two
hours each night thereafter.

“The reason it took so long
was that there were so many steps
we had to get just right,” Micci
said. “When Friday came we were
ready and everyone was excited. I
don’t think anyone was nervous.”

Micci added that each of the
seven girls in the group had some
dance or cheerleading experi-
ence.

Overall, Micci said she felt the
event was more organized than
she had anticipated.

“Compared to stories I’d heard
[about past Lip Syncs], it seemed
pretty under control,” Micci said.
“There were not too many people
up there walking around, doing
nothing. Everyone had a plan.
There was so much excitement
associated with all the different
acts. The energy and creativity
made it so muchifun.”

Freshman Kelsey Wright per-
formed with fellow Chi Omegas
to win third place. Like the ﬁrst
and second place performances,
Chi O’s group also compiled a
medley of songs.

“Overall, I was very impressed
with'the caliber of the competi-

tion,” Wright said. “There were

many acts that deserved to win.”
Referring to the $350 entry

fee, raised from $150 in previous
years, Wright said, “I think the
increased fees encouraged every-
one to practice and perform their
very best.”

Performances were judged

‘based on the following criteria:

choreography, lip synching abil-
ity, costumes, timing (acts were
supposed to be capped at ﬁve
minutes) and the crowd’s reaction.
Each judge ranked performances
from one to ten in each category,
and the judges’ scores were com-
bined to give each group a score
out of 300. Tripp Onnen, advisor
for Students Against Rockbridge
Area Hunger, said MSA received
a score of 288.

Onnen also said groups that
were too inappropriate were
“gonged” off the stage. As for
the threat of a $500 ﬁne for being
gonged, Onnen said from the be-
ginning the judges knew “that just
wasn’t going to happen.”

“The $500 threat was meant
to scare [students] out of doing
something too gratuitous,” Onnen
said.

He added that the staff never
had an intention of actually ﬁning
groups for inappropriate behav-
ior, though Onnen said if some-
thing extremely outlandish had
occurred, he would have been
willing to ﬁne a group. Instead,
he said, “we were just trying to
put the fear of God into them, so

MSA brings iton

Students choreograph acts to raise $1 4, 000 for local charity working to alleviate hunger

to speak.”

Onnen said there was only one
group he was “pretty upset with,
but other than that, I think it was
done very well.”

Margo McClinton, Director
of Campus Activities, was one of
the judges for the event. She said
criteria for being gonged included
acts that were “just not very good

-or crude.” Overall, McClinton

said acts were “more appropriate”
this year. i

“There were some really good
acts this year,” McClinton said.
“I could tell people took time to
choreograph.”

EC President Rob Rain said he
enjoyed judging the event for the
ﬁrst time this year, and like Me-
Clinton, he “did not feel that very
many of the acts were too inap-
propriate--at least no more inap-
propriatethan in years past.”

According to Onnen, the event
raised about $14,000 to be donat-
ed to local food pantiies.

Onnen said there is no denying
that students attend Lip Sync for
the entertainment, but the money
raised is the most important part
of the experience.

“I know people are there to see
friends act like idiots on stage, but
at the end of the day if that’s what
raises $14,000, the end justiﬁes
the means,” Onnen said.

He also added that it is impor-
tant for students to be aware of
the world outside campus.

“A lot of people blow through
here in four years and don’t think
about the people you see at Wal-
Mart or Stop-In who live here
their whole lives,” Onnen said.
“[Lip Sync] is a great way to give
back to the community that be-
comes your second home for four
years.”

Women’s Basketball

The Washington and Lee women’s
basketball team went undefeated
last week, defeating Southern
Virginia on Thursday evening
and Guilford College on Tuesday
night. The Generals defeated
SVU by a score of 66-62. The
Generals were led by junior for-
ward Amanda Kane who scored a
season-high 13 points. Kane also
hit three three-pointers. Senior
center Jessica Hunsinger scored
12 points and pulled down 13
rebounds. Hunsinger also got
three blocks. Sophomore guard
Bethany Ridenhour posted 12
points and three assists. Junior
forward Kristen Krouchick added
in 11 points and six rebounds. The
W&L women’s basketball team
managed to pull oﬂ‘ a 49-46 win
over Guilford despite shooting
just 29.2 percent from the ﬁeld.
The Generals carried a one-point

‘advantage over their ODAC foe

into the half, and Hunsinger went
on to score six straight points to
open the second stanza, giving
W&L a seven-point lead. Guilford
then went on a 12-1 run to take
back the lead. Sophomore forward
Kara Nadeau responded by hitting
a jumper to cut Guilford’s lead to
a slim two points. Back-to-back
layups Krouchick gave the Gener-
als a 47-45 lead with 25 seconds
remaining. Guilford’s Jasmine
Wood converted on 1-of-2 foul
shots with 18 seconds left to cut
the lead to 47-46, but W&Lsopho-
more guard Bethany Ridenhour
hit a pair of free throws with 12
seconds left to clinch victory for
the Generals. The Generals were
led by Hunsinger’s 16points, 12 of
which came in the second half, and
11 rebounds. Ridenhour tallied
seven points, nine rebounds and
four assists. On Tuesday evening,
the women ’s basketball team tied
a program record by winning their
ﬁfth consecutive game, defeat-
ing Emory & Henry 62-44. The
Generals improved their record to
10-8, equaling their record in the
2001-2002 season.

Track and Field

The Washington and Lee men’s
and women’s indoor track & ﬁeld
teams competed against Division
I, II and III schools at the Liberty
On Track Open on Friday and Sat-
urday. Over the two-day contest,
the Generals captured four ﬁrst-
place ﬁnishes, 25 top-ﬁve ﬁnishes

\ and set one school-record. The

women were led by freshman Kat
Telfeyan, who took ﬁrst among
Division III competitors in the
3000 meters. Sophomore Becca
Taylor crossed the ﬁnish line ﬁrst
among D-III opponents in the
mile. Junior Lil Brandler was the
top D-III competitor in the pole
vault clearing a height of 2.90 me-
ters. Freshman Maggie Sutherland
scored the Generals’ lone school
record with her 5’3” performance
in the high jump. The men were
led by sophomore Drew Martin
and freshman Billy Billington.
Each placed second among Divi-
sion III athletes in their respective
events. Martin registered a 143”
performance in the pole vault,
while Billington recorded 12.10
meters in the shot put. Washington
and Lee returns to action on Friday
as it competes at the VMI Winter
Relays in Lexington.

 

Greatest player ever‘?  

F ederer wins tenth Grand Slam tournament at Australian Open without dropping a set.

By Adam Lewls
COLUM NIST

he Swiss may be
known for their
banks, knives, and
cheese, but I think
its time to add one more
thing to that
list: tennis.
The world
of tennis is
currently being
taken over by
a Swiss man
named Roger
Federer.
Federer
just notched his third Aus-
tralian Open championship.
all the while shedding about
three drops of sweat. He won
the tournament without los-
ing a single set, something that
has not been done in a Grand
Slam event since 1980! And
if you have trouble realizing
the magnitude of that, think of
a NFL team wi1111ing the Super
Bowl after not giving up a sin-
gle touchdown throughout the

whole playoffs. It‘s that amaz-
ing. Instead of shaking hands
after losing. his opponents may
as well have gotten on their
knees, bowed, and said “We’re
not worthy,” because honestly,
they‘re not.

And if you watch him play,
you will see why. With his over-
powering serve, silky-smooth
groundstrokes, and composed
playing style, he is the most
graceful sight on the tennis court
since Anna Kournikova stretch-
ing. And I think that is saying
a lot. Just this past Australian
Open finals, Federer faced Fer-
nando Gonzalez, who was com-
ing oil‘ victories against num-
ber 5-seeded James Blake and

number 2-seeded Rafael Nadal.
Not only did Roger take down
Gonzalez in straight sets, but in
a string often service games, he
lost only four points. Can you
say total domination?

He goes through tournaments
like an overweight child goes
through a box of cookies—de—
vouring each cookie (opponent)
one by one, rarely dropping a
crumb (set), until there is noth-
ing left except the box (trophy).
And, like watching this child
complete his tremendous feat,
all you can do while watching
Federer is gape in awe. He’s
that good.

But how does he match up
with the sport’s all-time greats?

Well, in three years of holding
the number one world ranking,
Federer has a 247-15 record,
which is ﬁfteen wins more than
second place’s Ivan Lendl, who
is regarded by some as the best
player of all time. Additionally,
in those three years, he has 34
titles, which is more than Lendl,
Pete Sampras, Bjorn Borg, An-
dre Agassi, and Jimmy Con-
nors.

That’s averaging over eleven
wins a season, for three straight
years, something thattnone of
the afore-mentioned players has
ever accomplished. So those
scrubs can start bowing as well.

And to continue rambling off
career achievements, Federer
is less than a month away from
holding the longest consecutive
streak at Number 1.

Moreover, he is the three-
time defending champion at
Wimbledon and the US Open,
something that has never been
done before. If there was ever
a dynasty in tennis, I think now
would be the time.

A And tennis isn’t the only

Swimming:

thing in which this Swiss man
sits at the top. In 2006, he was
named the Goodwill Ambassa-
dor to UNICEF, an organization
that assists impoverished chil-
dren around the world. Through
UNICEF and his personal char-
ity, the Roger Federer founda-
tion, Federer has helped fund
the recovery of tsunami victims,
made trips to South Asia, and
participated in various chari-
table events which raise money
for his causes. ,

With all of these charity ef-
forts, as well as his media ap-
peal to all people (he speaks
three languages), and oh yeah,
his tennis ability, it is no wonder
why Roger Federer is constantly
being awarded honors such as
the European Sportsman of the
Year, the United States Sports
Academy’s Most Outstand-
ing Athlete of the Year, and the
Laureus World Sportsman of
the Year.

So whether you’re into sports
betting or charity, your money
is far safer with this Swiss asset
than in those stupid banks.

you may have taken us out in
the dual meet but you have no idea
what you are facing at ODACS,”
Sauter warned.

“All the strength that we’Ve
built up for the past couple of
months will become evident
when we beat Randy-Mac again,
and swim the best we ever have,”
said Miata.

“We have gained so much
from racing bigger and better
teams. Racing mediocre teams
does nothing but boost the ego;
swimming against the teams that
we have swum with this year has
helped us in every respect of the
game. While we may not come
out on top against ranked D-III
teams, the most important part is
that we have gained racing experi-
ence that will most deﬁnitely help
us going into another ODACS,”
said Sauter.

The women return to action
next Saturday against Hollins and
host Randolph-Macon Women’s
College in a double dual meet.
They will then beginpreparing
for the ODAC Championships.

On Friday, several underclass-
men were called upon to lead the
men against Marymount. Sopho-
mores Chris Diebold and Brett
Tatman touched ﬁrst in the 200
free and 100 breast and freshman
Winston Stagg won the 100 back.

Particularly impressive was
Kevin Com’s 4:57 in the 500 free
because he had switched from
breaststroke to distance freestyle
halfway through the season.

“It was a very strong race for
someone who is inexperienced
at the 500, and it’s a promising
sign for what he’ll be able to do at
Bluegrass. He’s one of the hard-
est workers in practice,” said Tim
McGlaston.

However, the men were more
focused on Saturdays meet

against Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity. Coming into the meet, the
men boasted a 9-0 record in dual
meets and were ranked 14"‘ in
the country. Johns Hopkins was
ranked 13"‘ nationally and some
have picked them to ﬁnish as

high as third at nationals this year.
Though Shinoﬁeld predicted the
Generals would “need to swim
the perfect meet to win,” he knew
“the guys had the ability to pull it
together.”

Shinoﬁeld’s optimism came
up short on Saturday as the men
suffered their ﬁrst dual meet de-
feat of the season by score of 146-
110.

“Now we know what it takes to
win against really good competi-
tion. It puts our prior success this
season in perspective, and it will
help us focus on where we need
to improve before the champion-
ships,” said Tim McGlaston.

Though the result was disap-
pointing, there were several bright
spots for the men. Tim McGlaston
won the 50 free against one of the
best Division III sprinters in the
country, Hopkins’ Brad Test.

In the ﬁnal event, the 400 free
relay, anchor Mike Ginder made
up a half second on Hopkin’s Test
to give the Generals the victory by
less than two tenths of a second.

“Ginder ﬁnished amazingly
strong and out-touched the Hop-
kins relay. Despite not having one
of the best meets of our season,
this was a great way to end the
meet and prove that we are ca-
pable of competing with the best
teams in the nation,” said Kevin
Corn.

The men appear to have put
the loss behind them as they pre-
pare for their next meet in Blacks-
burg, Va., against VMI and host
Virginia Tech.

“I‘don’t think we need to do
anything [diﬁ”erently],” said Alex
Sweet. “I think that we are going
to be so frustrated, not so much
because of the loss, but because
we didn’t even make it close.
Everyone should be focused next
week and looking to bounce back
and put some fear into a fully
funded D-l team [Virginia Tech].
I think the loss to Hopkins is only
going to make us want to beat
them more when we swim them
at nationals,” Sweet added. “It
would be easy to gain back all
that was lost this weekend with a
few good swims at nationals.”

Hopkins pins Generals

Wrestlers lose one—point decision to Johns Hopkins on Saturday

By Madeline Gent
STAFF wmrsn

Washington and Lee Wrestling
had a very busy last week. Dur-
ing last Wednesday’s match with
Southern Virginia University the
Generals completely dominated
the mats with a 48-6 victory.
With eight individual victories,
the dual-meet triumph was a
much needed conﬁdence booster
going into Saturday.

On Saturday afternoon, the
Generals hosted John Hopkins
in a Centennial Conference dual
meet. The Generals walked away
with four individual victories in
the one point team loss. Freshman
Sammy Brusca got much needed
back points towards the end of his
match, allowing him to secure a
tech fall over Hopkin’s Michael
Sumner in the 125 weight class.
Within the last minute and a half,
Brusca turned his opponent twice,
giving the Generals ﬁve team

a wacky 
Weekend

continued from page 10

When we got into Jackson-
ville, downtown had been closed
off. There were food and beer
stands set up all along the road and
masses of people milled around
the city. We hung out in down-
town Jacksonville for a while and
then drove back to our hotel.

My hair had gotten long while I
was away at school, and my older
brother and dad had been bugging
me to cut it since we got on the
plane to head down. In the mom-
ing, before I woke up, my dad and
older brother went out and got an
electric razor. When I woke up,
I agreed to let them cut my hair.
My dad decided to try and make
the sides shorter than the middle,
but the plan fell apart when he
cut the two sides very unevenly.
We ﬁnally decided to cut bait and
leave the haircut as it was.

Afterwards, we drove into
Jacksonville for the game. The
NFL had a big pre-party going
outside Alltell Stadium. There
was a huge tent with several buf-
fet tables and open bars inside
as well as several football video
game demos. Outside the tent
was a live band, an area when you
could meet current and former
NFL players, several shops for
Super Bowl memorabilia and a
few live TV broadcasts. We hung
out at the party for a while and
then went into the game.

There was a seat cushion with
a package of souvenirs attached
to it on every seat. One of the
things in the souvenir pouch was
a while cardboard sheet that we
were supposed to hold up during
halftime for a special effects part
of the iight show.

P Diddy, or whatever he goes
by now, was about twenty rows in
front of us on the left.

After we watched the Patriots
beat the Eagles, we went back
outside for the post-party. In the
same tent as the pre-party, they
had again set up several open bars
and had stocked the buffet tables
with desserts. After hanging
around the post party for a while,
we drove back out to our hotel
and got up early in the morning to
ﬂy back to school before class.

Junior Anthony Boniello add-
ed a victory at 165 pounds over
JHU’s Kyle Keane. The biggest
win of the day would have to go
to junior Peter Lawrence in the
157 pound weight class. He de-
feated Hopkin’s James Crumlish
in an 8- 6 win. Lawrence lost to
Crumlish earlier in the year, but
by dominating the mat on his feet
he secured some much needed
take downs.

Junior wrestling teammate
Adam Hockensmith thought it
was quite the match. “It was just
so sick,” he said.

Junior Dave Shubick also won
his 133 pound match by forfeit.

Junior Jesse Sataloff and soph-
omore Rob Terrin had close bouts
in the 141 and 174 weight classes
respectively. Terrin’s loss was
a tight decision the entire way
through, and Sataloff’s loss was
by an one point escape by JHU’s
David Kraus.

“We ’re going up against some conference lead-

ers. Its going to be real tight. If we win a few

key matches we can get it. ”

ANTHONY BONIELLO, W&L wrestler

Sataloff and Kraus had
wrestled previously and both
knew their opponent well. There
were no take downs or reversals
throughout their entire match.

“I thought it was a team ef-
fort,” said Lawrence. “We had a
lot of kids wrestle well. It was
really close because we lost two
matches by just three, and with
a point or two from any other
matches it would have gone our
way.”

Collecting six individual vic-

, tories, Hopkins left campus with

an 18- 17 victory over the blue
and white.

The Generals will return to the
mat this Saturday afternoon when
they host McDaniel, Muhlenberg,
and Ursinus starting at 11 a.m.

“We’re going up against some
conference leaders,” said Boni-
ello. “It’s going to be real tight. If
we win a few key matches we can
get it.”

With two opposing wrestlers
ranked within the top eight of the
country in their weight classes,
Saturday’s match will be an excit-
ing one for the Generals.

“We’re trying to keep up a high
intensity and ﬁnish up the season
strong,” said junior Eric Gagne.

CONTRIBUTING WRITER

I must make a confession:
I’m a huge fan of both Peyton
Manning and Tony Dungy.
Peyton Manning works as
hard as anyone in sport. His
work ethic rivals that of the
hardest working man in foot-
ball history--another Payton:
The great, and unfortunately
late, Walter Payton, and he ex-
udes personality. Tl1o'se com-
mercials in which he roots for
the “Everyperson” should win
Emmys. Actually, can one win
an Emmy by starring in a com-
mercial?

Manning also seems like a
great son and a great brother:
I like that. Dungy is all class
and character. If it is true that
“one’s character is one’s des-

Men lose pair of heartbreakers T

at home in front of big crowds

By Kevln Trempe
surr WRITER

Plagued by missed free throws
down the stretch and a defense
keying on star forward Greg Bi-
enemann, Washington and Lee’s
men’s basketball team suffered a
heartbreaking loss to 24th-ranked
Guilford College on Wednesday,
falling in the ﬁnal second by a
score of 62-61. This devastat-
ing loss was not the ﬁrst for the
Generals in the last week, as the
team fell 70-64 to Roanoke Col-
lege on Saturday night, snapping
a ﬁve-game home winning streak
and forcing the Generals to wait
another game to clinch a spot in
the ODAC playoffs.

Though the game seemed
out of reach, the Generals had a
chance to pull off the upset when
star forward Greg Bienemann was
fouled with 0.3 seconds left in the
game, needing two free throws
for the win. After missing the
ﬁrst and sitting through a Guilford
timeout, Bienemann watched as
his second shot rimmed out ,and
the ﬁnal buzzer sounded.

1 Down eighteen points at half-
time to Guilford, W&L relied on
near-perfect three-point shooting
in the second half to eliminate the
deﬁcit in the ﬁnal minute, taking
a one-point lead with 40 seconds

to go. With the shot clock wind- ,

ing down, Guilford forward Eric
Belkoski hit a three-pointer to
give the Quakers a 62-61 lead.
Bienemann’s second miss was re-
bounded by a Guilford center, and
W&L fell just short of knocking
off its ﬁrst ranked opponent this
season.

Swimming splits
weekend contests

Men and women both beat Marymount but fall to Hopkins

By Michael Keenan
surr wrmsn

The Washington and Lee
men’s and women’s swimming
teams competed twice over the
weekend. They~traveled to take
on Marymount Friday evening
before continuing on to Baltimore
to swim Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity on Saturday.

“The Marymount meet on Fri-
day will be a very good test for
the women-they narrowly beat
Marymount at the F&M invita-
tional and this should be a very
close meet. The women have re-
ally been swimming well lately
and I ‘truly feel like they will rise
to the occasion and win the meet.
The men should have some good
races on Friday. but we are much
deeper than Marymount, so it will
give some of our freshmen an op-
portunity to lead the way,” said
Coach Joel Shinoﬁeld before the
meet.

As Shinoﬁeld predicted, the
women met the challenge and
emerged victorious by a score of
109-96. The women were led by
Susan Mahoney’s win in the 1000
free, Jessica Shaw’s ﬁrst place
ﬁnish in the 200 IM and Lind-
sey Strachan’s victory in the 100
back. The 200 medley relay and
200 free relays also notched ﬁrst
place ﬁnishes.

“There was so much more
energy between us than there’s
been at previous meets. We really
swam as a team. You could look

around during any race, and no
one was sitting down. We were
all on our feet cheering because
every race mattered,” said Jenna
Worsham.

“The win over Marymount has
come at the perfect time for the
women’s team,” said Captain Ab-
bie Sauter. “We have had an in-
credibly hard season which hasn’t
been easy on the team’s morale,
and we all knew that Marymount
would be a very close meet. We
had to pull together as a team in
order to come out with a win, and
although we have had diﬁiculty
all having great swims at once,
the team ﬁnally came together to
have a tremendous meet.”

“The win over Marymount
deﬁnitely boosted our conﬁdence
as we approach the time for the
conference meet. Our schedule
has been extremely difﬁcult this
season, so we haven’t won a meet
for some time now. This win as-
sures us that our abilities as a
team have not changed, and that
we have improved over the past
couple of months,” said Julianne
Miata.

Saturday’s meet against Hop-

kins offered the women’s team a
chance to swim against some of
the best in the country. Hopkins’
women’s team entered the meet
ranked 10"‘ in the country. This is
the sixth meet this season against
top-25 ranked teams for the wom-
en’s team.

“Swimming against so many
teams that are ranked in the top-
25 is tough to handle.  We actu-
ally prefer this schedule over an
easier one. Swimming against
more competitive teams means
that we will be much more pre-
pared for our races when we ﬁ-
nally swim Randolph Macon in
the conference championship,”
said Miata.

With only one dual meet re-
maining, the women are eagerly
looking forward to the ODAC
Championship Meet, in which
they hope to win their 14th con-
secutive ODAC title.

“While Randy Mac may have
a better record, we have had more
competition and more practice
with racing which deﬁnitely gives
us the edge. Watch out RM-C,

See “SWIMMING” on page 6

The loss dropped the Generals
to 10-7 on the season, with a 5-6
record against conference oppo-
nents.

The Roanoke game was never
out of reach for W&L. The Gen-
erals were down a point at half-
time, took a lead the ﬁrst posses-
sion of the second half and again
cut the deﬁcit to one to trail 65-
64 going into the ﬁnal minute of
the game. However, they would
be held scoreless for the remain-
der of the contest, and solid free-
throw shooting by the Maroons
was enough to seal the victory.
Bienemann, who had come into
the game averaging over 21 points
per game, was held to just nine by
a Roanoke defense, who relied on
double-coverage for much of the
night.

Despite the losses, it is clear
that basketball is back in Lex-
ington. At the annual Lip Sync
competition on Friday night, se-
nior co-captain Alex White took
the stage to thunderous applause,
encouraging students to come out
to the game the next evening. All
week, conversation around lunch
tables, classrooms and frat houses
touched on the quiet success of
the basketball team. And on Sat-
urday, despite a typical night of

O

mixers and parties around cam-Q

pus, 510 people showed up to
watch the Generals take on Roa-
noke, by far the highest home at-
tendance this season. At 10-7, the
Generals are off to their best start
in 17 years,

Said freshman John Twomey:
“This season has really exceeded
everyone’s expectations.”

talked about go-

Bowl but had
never been able to go because
of the various sports commit-
ments my little brother and I
had. We ﬁnally ﬁgured it out
so that we could go down my
freshman year at Washington

wrestling match, my two broth-
ers, my dad and I boarded the
plane for Jacksonville.

We had to stay in a motel
about an hour north of Jackson-
ville because everything in the
city was booked. Even an hour
outside the city there was a
three-night minimum with pre-
mium rates for the motel rooms.
After we got settled into the ho-
tel, we drove into Jacksonville
for the night. On the way into
Jacksonville the Super Bowl
ﬁreworks show, which was the
longest, most extravagant ﬁre-
works show any of us had ever
seen, started going off. Several
cars, including ours, pulled off
the road to watch for over a half
hour while the show went on.
