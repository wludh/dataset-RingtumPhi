Former ambassador and Peace Corp director will lead discussions at Institute for Honor

By Wes O’De|l
STAFF WRITER

Ambassador Richard Hol-
brooke will be on campus later
this month to participate in a fo-
rum exploring the extent to which
shared values such as truth, honor
and integrity cross national and
cultural boundaries.

Holbrooke, a former U.S. rep-
resentative to the United Nations,
is considered to be atop contender
for the post of Secretary of State
in any future Democratic admin-
istration.

In addition to serving as di-
rector of the Peace Corps, as a
magazine editor and as an invest-
ment banker, Holbrooke has been
Assistant Secretary of State for

both Europe and Asia. He is the
only person to ever hold such a
position for two different world
regions. He served as an advisor
to Sen. John Kerry’s presidential
campaign in 2004.

Holbrooke also served as
chairman of the 1995 Dayton
peace conference that ended a
three year war in Bosnia and Her-
zegovina.

Sponsoring these discussions
is the Alumni College’s Institute
for Honor. Endowed in 2000 by
the Class of 1960, the Institute’s
mission is “to promote the under-
standing and practice of honor as
an indispensable element of soci-
ety.”

Its seminars enroll a maxi-
mum of 150 alumni, students, and

faculty in a program of lectures,
readings, and small group discus-
sions.

This year’s topic is aimed to-
ward discovering how “differ-
ing nations identify and embrace
common values” and what role
the United States can play in es-
tablishing “a value-based code
of conduct in international rela-
tions.”

Law school Prof. Mark Drum-
bl, Director of the Transnational
Law Institute, is slated to join
Ambassador Holbrooke in lead-
ing the events on Jan. 26-27. He
will be delivering a keynote ad-
dress entitled “Exporting Ameri-
can Norms: Values, Honor, and
Controversy in U.S. Foreign
Policy.”

While he asserts there are
many features of honor common
the world over, Drumbl points out
that “many salutary values are
deeply rooted in local practices
and cultures. The role of inter-
national law, which is my area
of study, is to preserve the local
while building shared values, or-
der, and regulation.”

Drumbl takes particular note
of how America’s own values
have “informed world order,” and
maintains that “it is essential for
[the US] to stick with positive
values in changing times—for us
not to deviate from them even in
difficult periods.”

“The U.S. was central to the
ediﬁcation of institutions such
as the Nuremberg Tribunals and

“It is essentialfor [the US] to stick with posi-

tive values in changing times--for us not to

deviatefrom them even in diﬁicult periods. ”
MARK DRUM BL Director of the Transnatlonal Law Instltute

the United Nations,” he said, and
now “it is incumbent upon us to
preserve those same honorable
values and apply them, in good
faith, to changing times.”

The Institute for Honor, now
entering its seventh year, has man-
aged to avoid the notice of much
of the student body. A survey con-
ducted of several upperclassmen
found virtually no recognition of

the Institute ’s mission or even its
existence.

The students did agree, how-
ever, that different nations and
cultures can ﬁnd common ground
upon certain shared ideals.

Sophomore .Will Covington
said, “It’s important that we look
at these issues so we can ﬁnd val-
ues in other cultures that reﬂect
our own.”

Speech calls for action

Episcopalian missionary calls upon students to speak out and end the conﬂict in Sudan

By Melissa Caron
smrr warren

everend Lauren Stan-

ley ﬁnished her talk

on bringing hope to

Sudan by calling for
the audience to do one thing—to
be Sudan’s voice.

“We need you to do this,”
Stanely said. “We in Sudan are
expecting you in the United States
to stomp your feet because no one
pays attention to us.”

Stanley, the only full-time
Episcopalian missionary in Su-
dan, was forced to return to the
United States recently because of
escalating tensions in the region,
concluding her I8-month stay.

Robert E. Lee Episcopal
Church and Washington and
Lee’s Young Life brought Stanley
to speak last week about her expe-
riences and how faith affected the
community she was in.

Sudan has experienced internal
conﬂict since the 1970s, in which
ethnic warfare and genocide has
taken place between the north and
south.

Stanley’s speech came one
week after the second anniversary
of signed peace treaty, which she
said did not actually bring peace
to the region.

She described how, at 46-years-
old, she had already seen four

genocides~Cambodia, Rawanda,
Kosovo, and now Darfur—and
still nothing has changed.

“We’re not doing anything,”
Stanley said. “My question for
you is when we say never again,
when do we mean this?”

Stanley described a grim situ-
ation where opposing troops lay
in wait for war on either side of
the community she works and
lives in. She spoke of a govem—
ment that does not allow medi-
cine into the country to help pre-
vent curable but deadly illnesses,
like malaria.

“I don’t think anyone in the
audience wasn’t touched,” said
Burr Datz, Coordinator of Re-
ligious life and the Director
of Leadership Development at
W&L.

According to Stanley, college-
aged students wield immense
power to bring about change
through awareness.

“You are the most tolerant and
accepting generation,” Stanley
said, “and we are depending on
you to teach us.”

This past year, W&L students
have answered this call through
the efforts of organizations such
as Student Association for Inter-
national Learning (SAIL) and
Amnesty International.

Grace Andrews, co-chair of
SAIL, said that Sudan was the or-

pecting you in the United States to stomp your

feet because no one pays attention to us. ”

ganization’s main issue this year
and that they have done a lot to
try to create awareness and raise
money for the relief effort.

“The goal is to get awareness
out there and to let people know
that they are not helpless,” An-
drews said. “They do have pow-
er.”

Last term, the organization
teamed up with Amnesty Inter-
national to put on a talent show
and did a fundraiser called “Say
What Karaoke—Faculty Edition,”
in which people could vote for
the faculty member they wanted
to sing by putting money in cups
labeled with his or her name.

Dean Dawn Watkins was cho-
sen and had to sing “Stand by Your
Man” at halftime of the Parents’
Weekend football game. SAIL
also went through the crowd at
the game accepting donations.

In all, they were able to send
$2,400 to CARE, a non-proﬁt
organization that Andrews de-

scribed as important to SAIL’s
efforts since all the money goes
directly to Sudan.

Andrews said that SAIL has
planned a lot of events for this
term, such as bringing a spoken
word group called “Road to Dar-
fur” to W&L.

SAIL has called on other stu-
dent organizations in part to help
fund the performance and also to
get more people involved in help-
ing the Sudan effort.

“We don’t want to say ‘Hey,
look what SAIL brought’ but rath-
er ‘Look what Washington and
Lee brought’,” Andrews said.

She said groups have been
generous and even willing to help
out through manpower if they did
not have the funds.

Many of SAIL’s efforts have
focused on creating awareness
rather than just asking for dona-
tions. Andrews said that letting
people swipe home donations,
while helpful, does not always

educate the individual about the
cause to which they are giving.

Other possible events include
a letter-writing campaign and an-
other “Say What Karaoke,” this
time with the winner singing at
a basketball game. Andrews said
that SAIL will also be looking
to start a program called “Darfur
Initiative Awareness.” They will
be setting up computers in the
Commons with access to a web-
site that ranks Congressmen on
how they vote for initiatives deal-
ing with Sudan.

Andrews hopes that since it
only takes a couple of minutes to
look up a state, many more people
will become aware of the condi-
tion of Sudanese policy and con-
tact their Congressmen.

Datz agreed that it was this
kind of awareness campaigns that
make a difference.

“When one voice brings in
four more then a ripple becomes a
wave,” Datz said. “Then we have
a tsunami that brings in change.”

Stanley, while stressing the
need for hope within communi-
ties in Sudan, called upon the rest
of the world to help bring change
for the war—tom nation.

“Presidents listen to polls.
Congressmen listen to polls. A
government by the people listens
to the people. You are the people.
Speak.”

- to halt viruses

New Safe Computing Initiative will attempt to stop viruses
and help university protect student eomputersﬁfom damage

By Dane Davis
STAFF WRITER

In an effort to ﬁght the ever-
present threat of computer viruses
and worms, University Comput-
ing has launched a new initiative
to protect students’ computers

Dubbed the Safe Computing
Initiative, the project is a new
plan to stop viruses from spread-
ing once they are in the universi-
ty’s networks.

The plan, which is in its ﬁrst
phase, will require students to
download and install a series of
virus protection software before
connecting to the university net-
work from a residence hall.

The initiative will not imme-
diately be implemented campus-
wide. Instead, the students of Gil-
liam dorm will test out the new
software starting on Jan. 23.

If successful there, the new
software will be required for all
dorms, campus residence halls,
and the sorority houses.

The main reason for this
new initiative is the tremendous
amount of damage each year vi-
ruses and other malware (soft-
ware that is bad for your com-
puter) cause W&L’s and students’
computers.

Those stops were added to help
the large numbers of law students

Adam Hull, president of the

Despite the small size of the
student body, more than 300 stu-
dents came to the computing help
desk last year to get assistance
with a computer infected by vi-
ruses or malware. Homework
assignments, résumés, personal
data, graduate school and job ap-
plications are all at risk from a
virus infection.

Aside from data deletion, mal-
ware can wreak havoc on one’s
computer in other ways. Popups,
advertisements, and slow-downs
can all result from contamina-
tion.

The infected computer isn’t
the only thing harmed by mal-
ware. Jeff Overholtzer, acting
head of the Technology Integra-
tion Group, said “W&L staff time
[spent] combating the problems
and a loss of network availabil-
ity” are just two symptoms of un-
protected computers.

All of the risks associated
with unprotected computers have
given W&L a special impetus to
secure its networks.

a big impact.”

Hull said law students don’t
like to walk home along Jefferson
and Main Streets because the area
is heavily patrolled by police. He
also said the new Country Ex-
press should help reduce demand
for the dispatch system, hopefully
allowing more law students to use
that service.

The new stops in town should
help keep law students oﬁ the
street, but Lexington Police Chief
Steve Crowder said all students
need to be careful when they wait
for Traveller.

He said students should re-

to be drinking at the stops and that

across the Greenhouse Road from
the driveway up Windfall Hill.
She said the area has been much
quieter after midnight.

“lt’s deﬁnitely helped,”. she
said. “I noticed [Wednesday]
night that the buses went in and
on up the hill.”

Garrett is pleased that the noise
has diminished late at night, but
she is still bothered by trash that
is left around the driveway that
goes up Windfall Hill. In recent
weeks, however, Garrett said the
trash has mostly been unopened
newspapers instead of cups and
beer cans.

Garrett said she and other

“Traveller has to shake its

J FK—like Obama
could heal the US

Moderate goat-herder is son is a threat to the Republicans

By Dylan Merrlll
co LUM NIST

Barack Obama is a god.

By this, I mean to say that he
does have supernatural abilities,
chief amongst them the power of
ﬂight. Republicans, beware!

In fact, there are many reasons
conservatives should fear the al-
mighty senator from Illinois.

First of all, Obama’s charisma,
coupled with his undeniable intel-
ligence, elevates him above the
generally low-set bar of Demo-
cratic mediocrity.

Comparisons to Bill Clinton
are common, and many have even
placed him in JFK territory.

Given the diversity of their
backgrounds, is a Kenyan Jack
Kennedy possible?

Can a black ﬁrst-generation
politician with the middle name
of Hussein possibly penetrate into
the world of Fitzgeralds and Jef-
fersons?

Republicans are skeptical,
hopefully so. Pundits on both
sides of the aisle remain uncon-
vinced that Obama is presidential
enough to run the country effec-
tively." Their main concern is that
he lacks the necessary experience,
having served only a few years in
the U.S. Senate.

The facts, though, support a
different conclusion.

Obama’s time in Congress has
been very productive; the senator
has had success in passing impor-
tant and generally bipartisan leg-
islation. His service on the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee
especially gives weight to his
experience, regardless of the ac-
cusations that he is a high-proﬁle,

Not so inviting is the prospect of
a torn nation backing the unifying
candidacy of Barack Obama.

media-hungry politician.

Even if Barack Obama is
overly anxious for attention, this
does not discredit his abilities as a
leader and policymaker, because
he is made of stuff more solid
than most.

I saw Obama speak at a Demo-
cratic rally last fall, and his calm
demeanor and patience surprised
the crowd. Much ﬁst-pumping
and Bushwhacking preceded his
speech, but he calmed the bois-
terous audience with thoughtful
words on the future of the coun-
try.

Obama even drew a few boos
from the crowd when he said that
he personally does not dislike the
president, and that he believes
George Bush really does believe
he is helping the country.

Such responsible reﬂection is
uncommon amongst politicians
and is the mark of a true states-
man.

Oh, and did I mention Barack’s
father was a Kenyan goat—herder?
Yeah. Late-night talk show hosts
will become top contributors to
his campaign just for the opportu-
nity to pun on that little tidbit.

We must also recognize that
this junior senator from Illinois
is currently in the center of his 15
minutes of fame. Obama knows
that his quarter hour surge cannot
last another six years; a presiden-

tial exploratory committee was
established this week to gauge
public support and begin ﬁmd-
raising.

Hillary Clinton and the Re-
publicans must be dismayed. Ob-
viously, Hillary feels a threat in
the young senator; his eloquence
and charisma have boosted him
into second place after Clinton,
whose image is quite tarnished,
even among Democrats like me.

This threat to her front-runner
status is deﬁnitely cause for con-
cern in the Clinton camp.

John McCain and Rudy Giu-
liani also feel threatened by

Obama, particularly in his abil- .

ity to get the moderate vote. It’s
safe to assume that both Repub-
licans are not looking forward to
competing against Obama to see
which one can be the purplest.

As a whole, Republicans have
been looking forward to seeing
Hillary’s Dean-a-saurus emotion-
al breakdown as she gets ham-
mered in the polls in 2008.

Not so inviting is the prospect
of a torn nation backing the unify-
ing candidacy of Barack Obama.

It is a matter of fact that one
day soon we can elect a leader
that really is a “uniter” and not a
“divider.”

Barack Obama is moving clos-
er every day to bringing our coun-
try together again. Amen!

Every American child
so-called American Dream.
We all learn that this is the
land of opportunity, the place
where anyone, through hard
work, can grow up to be fa-
mous.

For a long time, of course,
the American Dream was
nothing but a dream. Only
white males were actually

welcome.
But with the recent an-
nouncements that Barack

Obama, Hillary Clinton and
Bill Richardson will seek the
Democratic nomination, the
dream is becoming more of a
reality.

The fact that an African-
American, a woman, and a
Hispanic are all seeking the
nation’s highest oﬁice means
that this country is moving
closer and closer to the equal-
ity it claimed to believe in.

Can any of these candi-
dates win the general elec-
tion?

Perhaps not, but there is
an excellent chance that one

grows up learning about the

staffeditorial
American Dream
and our election

Issues, not skin color, should dominate election

of them will at least be the
Democratic nominee.

Obama, who burst onto
the scene two years ago, has a
chance to become this gener-
ation’s Kennedy. '

Clinton, who has trans-
formed herself from an un-
popular ﬁrst lady to a highly
respected senator, leads some
of the early polls.

And while Richardson is
more of a long shot, his His-
panic heritage could mobilize
a group that rarely turns out
to vote in large numbers.

The Democratic primary
and general election are go-
ing to force the nation to ad-
dress continuing issues with
race and gender discrimina-
tion head-on. Will Americans
elect a woman? A black man?
A Hispanic?

As the nation addresses
these questions, W&L must
continue to examine them
on our own campus. Are we
truly committed to providing
a diverse environment, or are
we simply giving the idea lip
service?

We saw this debate play
out on our opinions pages
last year when an anonymous
parent said W&L was playing
favorites in the admissions
process. While that particular
debate does not need to be re-
played, the general discussion
needs to continue.

Here is the disturbing part
of these discussions: Instead
of considering the relative
merits of people—whether they
are presidential candidates or
admissions candidates—too
much of the talk still centers
around gender and race. _

Does it matter that Barack
Obama’s father is from Ke-
nya? Does his skin tone alter
his ability to balance the bud-
get or solve the war in Iraq?

The same applies for Clin-
ton and Richardson.

They deserve to be consid-
ered on their political merits,
not on their race or gender.

As. we watch to see if
America will truly vote like
a melting pot, our community
should try to see if we mea-
sure up.

Daughter, 9, frozen in time

Parents remove breasts, uterus from dependent brain—damaged daughter

By Grace Andrews
c o LU M N I s I

Want a topic that not only sets
precedent but is also controver-
sial?

The discussion of life and the

. control in which parents can exer-

cise in a child’s life stirs up emo-
tions and elicits strong reactions.

Ashley, a 9-year-old with static
encephalopathy, a form of severe
brain damage, will be forever
young; unlike the Neil Diamond
song, however, this may not be
such a joyous event.

Ashley is not choosing this
life of preadolescence for herself
— her parents are.

Ashley’s brain damage results
in a continuous near-catatonic
state, leaving her unable to sit
up, communicate, or eat; Ashley
is completely dependent on her
caregivers, who are her parents.

What her parents have decided
to do has rocked and surprised
both the medical and non-medical
community.

Ashley’s parents have had her
uterus removed to offset men-
struation and prevent pregnancy
in the case of rape. They have
also removed her breast tissue in
order to prevent a family history
of cancer from infecting her small
and fragile body. Ashley has also
undergone high-dose estrogen
therapy, which will keep her pe-
tite and light for the remainder of
her life.

Weighing 65 pounds and being
4 foot 5 inches makes the concept
of “remaining small” a daunting
feat that doctors have achieved.

The question now is, “Is it eth-
ical or humane to keep a child as
a child forever?”

For Ashley, remaining 9 years old
could turn out to be the best decision
her parents ever made for her.

There are those who upon
hearing this story automatically
judge the parents and criticize the
doctors, but I want you to stop
and think for a moment.

If you had the inability to eat,
roll over, or even keep your head
up, wouldn’t you want for your
caregivers to always be able to
care for you? That is the argument
that Ashley’s parents raise.

They support their decision to
let Ashley undergo this treatment
by saying on their blog, “A fun-
damental and universal miscon-
ception about the treatment is that
it is intended to convenience the
caregiver; rather, the central pur-
pose is to improve Ashley’s qual-
ity of life.

“Ashley’s biggest challenges
are discomfort and boredom; all
other considerations in this dis-
cussion take a back seat to these
central challenges.

“The ‘Ashley Treatment’ goes
right to the heart of these chal-
lenges and we strongly believe
that it will mitigate them in a sig-
niﬁcant way and provide Ashley
with lifelong beneﬁts.

“Ashley will be a lot more
physically comfortable: free of
menstrual cramps, free of the
discomfort associated with large
and fully—developed breasts, and
with a smaller, lighter body that
is better suited to constant lying

down and is easier to be moved
around.”

In the past few days, I have
read several articles and even ex-
plored the blog myself to see if
I could develop a well-informed
opinion.

I am not going to lie-when I
ﬁrst read some of the news sto-
ries, my heart was heavy. Yes,
Ashley is mentally and physically
handicapped, but does that mean
she doesn’t deserve the chance to
experience the one thing that is as
deﬁning as the journey into adult-
hood?

Many of Ashley’s physicians,
although reluctant at ﬁrst, support
the surgery,

Dr. Daniel Gunther states,
“some disability advocates have
suggested that this course of
treatment is an abuse of Ashley’s
rights’ and an affront to her dig-
nity.’ This is a mystery to me.

“Is there more dignity in hav-
ing to hoist a full-grown body in
harness and chains from bed to
bath to wheelchair? Ashley will
always have the mind of an in-
fant, and now she will able to stay
where she belongs—in the arms
of the family that loves her.”

Gunther and other doctors
maintain that they are still uneasy
about Ashley’s case. They want to
wait until a few more years have
passed, to see the side effects of

the treatment, if there are any.

I still have not reached a de-
cision about Ashley’s situation.
I deﬁnitely understand what the
difﬁculties of caring for a grown
woman and all the physical devel-
opments that come with that bur-
den can be in contrast to a small
girl, but is this the right thing?

Many fear that Ashley’s pre-
cedence could forever change the
medical landscape for disabled
children and their parents.

Every day, there are count-
less mentally handicapped people
whose parents send them to group
homes because they are no lon-
ger able to care for a child that
now has the strength and size
of an adult. In Florida, there are
over 16,000 people who are on a
waiting list for home services in
caring for their disabled child or
relative.

“Faced with Ashley’s medical
reality, as her deeply loving par-
ents, we worked with her doctors
to do all we could to provide Ash-
ley with the best possible quality
of life. The result is the “Ashley .
Treatment.”

This quote for me, along with
many others I found on the blog,
helped me see the story in con-
text. '

By itself, this story seems like
one void of love and full of ob-
ligation, but it is more than that.
Ashley’s parent really do love
her, and for Ashley, remaining
9 years old could turn out to be
the best decision her parents ever
made for her.

Ashley’s story is not one from
Peter Pan’s Lost Boys, but may-
be they had the right idea—being
young is sometimes the best op-
tion.

Annual Founder is Day celebrations
honor Lee is‘ contributions to campus

By Abri Nelson
STAFF WRITER

His memory permeates the air
wherever you walk——past every
portrait and building, every sign
bearing the name of the universi-
ty, even every napkin in the din-
ing hall. Lee.

General Robert E. Lee: presi-
dent of Washington College from
1865 to 1870, founder of the
school's traditions and command-
er of the Confederate Army.

It is the last point that often
causes people to stumble over the
honor of this man who seems to
have touched every brick walk-
way and stood under every white
colunm on the campus grounds.

The world remembers Lee
for his actions against the Union.
Washington and Lee remembers
him as a mzui of virtue and schol-
arship.

Last Friday marked the 200"‘
anniversary of Lee’s birth. W&L
honors Lee”s birthday as Found-
er"s Day every year with a short-

ened class schedule and midday
convocation.

This year, events ranging from
art exhibits to poetry readings to
guest speakers will span the entire
year as the campus community
reﬂects on his role as an educator
and benefactor of the school.

During the fall term, three stu-
dents enrolled in the art intem-
ship class and assisted curator
Pamela Smith in assembling an
exhibit featuring Lee for the new
Staniar Gallery in Wilson Hall.
The exhibit, entitled “Re-Vrsion-
ing Lee,” opened Friday after-
noon and will be in the gallery
until Feb. 2.

Junior Madeline Gent and se-
niors Kathryn Heaberg and Anne
Taylor Tipton each spoke about
how they contributed their skills
to researching Lee and how his
legacy affects our campus today.

“The honor system is un-
questionably Lee’s most lasting
contribution,” said Tipton, a se-
nior art history major. “But his
example overall, as a gentleman

who strove to lead by example,
even in the face of the greatest
changes of the century, I think is
even more important.”

As president, Lee tumed then
Washington College into a mod-
em university. Only 40 students
and four professors remained at
the school after the Civil War. By
Lee’s death in 1870, the school
boasted more than 400 students.

Lee added 10 new departments
and faculty positions to stall“
them, including what became our
journalism school and the ﬁrst
international studies program. He
also conceptualized a business
school, introduced the elective
system and built a dining hall, a
house for the president and Lee
Chapel. He invited a law school
in Lexington to incorporate with
Washington College.

Other contributions were less
tangible. Lee began the honor
system on the basis that every
man must be a gentleman.

Today, this system allows
students to schedule their own

ﬁnals, take un-proctored exams
and leave their belongings unat-
tended in campus buildings.

“I almost feel like I should
stop and thank Lee every time I
throw my bag down in the Com-
mons," Heaberg said.

He also added the speaking
tradition to campus life, encour-
aging students by example to
greet everyone.

Lee himself never forgot the
name of a student. According to
Gent’s research, he took a per-
sonal interest in the education of
every scholar, receiving weekly
reports of their studies and con-
tacting parents directly if the
need arose.

Heaberg and Gent, both from
Pennsylvania, confessed that all
they knew about Lee before com-
ing to W&L was that he was the
general of the Confederate Army.

“Lee is a symbol of something
more,” Heaberg said. “It is W&L
students who are charged with
carrying on Lee’s vision today
and in the future.”

Washington and Lee's design department ‘head,
Larry Stene, created the piece “Fearless and
Faultless.” W&L commissioned this piece to cel-
ebrate Lee’s 200th birthday (top and middle right).
The piece is a play on Lee through the lens of mod-
em art. it celebrates his life while commemorat-
ing his legacy. The actual plece depicts Lee's last
train ride through the South during his presidency.
A contrast from the other classic pieces in the ex-
hlbit, Stene’s work adds an additional dimension
to the exhibit. As student curator Madeline Gent

said, “it’s sweet.”

Junior Drew Prasse admires a piece of art at the
“Re-Visioning Lee” reception held last Friday after-

noon (mlddle left).

“Cigar Store Robert E. Lee” watches over the
exhlbIt’s visitors in the corner (bottom right).

Often cigar stores advertised using ﬁgures of indi-
ans. However, a few were made depicting famous
historical ﬁgures. For instance, this sculpture (bot-
tom) of Lee was recently given as a gift to W&L

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 7

 

By Sarah Klentz
STAFF WRITER

The annual Lip Sync com-
petition will make its much-an-
ticipated return this Friday at the
Pavilion.

Although the competition is
oﬁen associated with hilarious
performances and drunken de-
bauchery, senior Chris Lalli, pres-
ident of Students Against Rock-
bridge Area Hunger (SARAH),
explained how the event is in the
name of a good cause.

All proceeds from Lip Sync
will go to SARAH. '

Money will be raised through
ticket and t-shirt sales, in addition
to the $350 entry fee for each per-
formance.

This year, SARAH’s steering
committee has encouraged the
W&L community to make online
donations by sending an e-mail

to onnenf@wlu.edu with a name,
student ID number and the amount
the individual wishes to donate.

Aﬁer Lip Sync, Lalli said
SARAH will donate the money to
all the food pantries in the Rock-
bridge area.

Lip Sync 2006 raised enough
money to_purchase over 20 tons of
food, and the group is hoping to
raise more money this year.

Lalli said one reason why
SARAH is able to raise so much
money through the Lip Sync com-
petition is the “party atmosphere”

of the event.

However, this can also take
away from the seriousness of hun-
ger in the Rockbridge area.

“I think the party atmosphere
can both hurt and help the experi-
ence,” Lalli said.

“There are times when people
are too intoxicated on stage, and
for thatreason acts can be re-
moved from .the stage. On a posi-
tive note, the party atmosphere
gives us a great audience that is
excited to see a great show, thus
raising money for a great cause.”

“On a positive note, the party atmosphere gives

us a great audience that is excited to see a great

show, thus raising money for a great cause. ”

CHRIS LALLI, president of SARAH

Student organizations

choreograph acts to

raise money for hunger

The acts will be judged by
well-known individuals on carn-
pus such as Executive Commit-
tee President Rob Rain, Director
of Campus Activities Margo Mc-
Clinton and several professors.

Lalli said the judges will name
the three best groups at the end of
the show.

“Winners are picked based
on the quality of their Lip Sync,
dance, costume and how appro-
priate the act is,” Lalli said.

Last year, Phi Kappa Psi earned
first place with its creatively cho-
reographed dance to the beat of
Michael Jackson’s “Thriller.”

A Multicultural Students Asso-
ciation group and a Kappa Alpha
Theta group captured acond and
third.

“We have begun to use a gong
similar to the Gong Show where
an act can be gonged off the stage
if they are terrible,” Lalli said.

Last year, several acts involv-
ing thongs and inappropriate
dancing were “gonged” oﬁ.

Any organization or group of
individuals can enter, but typi-
cally each fraternity and sorority
enters a group of new pledges to
perform in the event.

Lalli said this is one reason
why the event is so successful.

“Pledgeship deﬁnitely helps
the event, because people have
an excuse to make fools of them-
selves,” Lalli said.

Although students will joke
about Lip Sync next week around
campus, the event will ultimately
make a difference in the commu-
nity surrounding W&L.

The Lip Sync competition will
take place on Friday at 8 p.m. in
the Pavilion.

Tickets are $10 in advance, be-
ginning on Wednesday, or $12 at
the door.

The men’s basketball team got
its week off to a thrilling start
on Wednesday night when they
squeaked by Emory and Henry
98-96. After keeping up with
Emory and Henry’s frantic full-
court style of play for 40 minutes,
the Generals got the victory when
sophomore forward Kirk Jones
tipped in a lay-up with 2.2 seconds
left. With the score tied at 96,
W&L guard Chris Halkitis tried
a three-pointer with 11 seconds
left.

Greg Bienemann grabbed

a lay-up, and then Femi Kusimo
missed a tip-in attempt with three
seconds on the clock. Finally, on
the Generals fourth attempt of the
possession, Jones managed to put
the ball in the hoop. Bienemann
scored 30 points to lead W&L.
Kusimo added 16 while missing
only one shot. Relying on a
steady diet of lay-ups and short
jumpers, the Generals shot a
blistering 68 percent from the
ﬂoor. The Generals split a pair
of road games over the weekend,
losing on Saturday to Hampden-
Sydney and winning on Sunday
at Lynchburg. On Saturday the
Generals could not overcome
poor play during the middle part
of the game. The Tigers went on
a 16-2 run late in the ﬁrst half to
take a 13 point lead. During the
first 10 minutes of the second half
Hampden-Sydney only allowed
four points as they marched out
to an 18 point lead. Bienemann
again led the Generals, scoring
17 points. Freshman Zac White
scored a career high 14 points for
the losing side. W&L ﬁnished up
its week by stomping Lynchburg
84-67 on Sunday afternoon. Aﬁer
shooting a blistering 60 percent in
the ﬁrst half, the Generals took a
42-31 lead into the locker room.
Bienemann tied his career-high by
scoring 33 points. He also added
six rebounds and three assists.
Jones and forward Alex White each
added 10. The Generals ended the
week with a 9-5 overall record
and a 4-4 record in ODAC play.
They play at Eastern Mennonite
on Wednesday and host Roanoke
College at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday
night.

Track and field

Stacy Doombos defeated a ﬁeld of
Division I, 11 and I II runners to win
the 300 meter dash at Saturday’s
Marietta Open. Doombos, a soph-
omore, also ﬁnished ﬁrst among
Division III runners in the 500.
Freshman Kat Telfeyan ﬁnished
ﬁrst overall in the mile and also
set a school record by ﬁnishing in
5:26.02. Elizabeth Webb led all
Division III runners in the 800 with
a time of 2:29.56. The women’s
medley relay team also ﬁnished
ﬁrst overall, running the event in
a school-record time of 13:11.24.
On the men’s side Drew Martin
led the team by ﬁnishing second
amongD-III athletes in the pole
vault. Martin cleared a height of
14 and a half feet. The men’s long
distance relay team led all Division
111 teams and ﬁnished with a time
of 11:02.33.

The men’s and women’s teams
set three new school records and
ﬁnished ﬁrst in six events. Both
teams will be back in action on
Friday at the Liberty Open.

Generals capture six ﬁrst—pZace ﬁnishes and
set three new school records against D-I foes

By Mike Fahey
SPORTS EDITOR

It’s always difﬁcult when
a Division III track team has
to compete against Division
I and 11 Opponents in a meet.
However, the Washington and
Lee men’s and women’s indoor
track and ﬁeld teams rose to the
challenge this past week. The
teams competed at the Mari-
etta Invitational Open held on
Saturday in Marietta, Ohio.
They set three new school re-
cords, while registering six ﬁrst
places and 17 top-ﬁve ﬁnishes.
Sophomore sensation Stacy Door-
nbos led the charge, placing ﬁrst
overall in the 300 meters and ﬁrst
among all D-III competitors in
the 500 meters.

Freshman Kat Telfeyan took
ﬁrst overall in the mile, and soph-
omore Elizabeth Webb was the

women’s

ﬁrst D-Ill runner to cross the ﬁn-
ish line in the 800 meters.

On the men’s side, sophomore
Drew Martin led W&L men by
placing second among all Divi-

- sion Ill athletes in the pole vault.

Freshman Ryan Castle placed
fourth among D-III competitors
in the long jump.

This was a great experience
for the Generals. As Martin said,
“It gave us a chance to ﬁnally see
how we stack up against some
other really good track teams.”

Castle agreed, saying, “Since
it’s so early in the season, these
types of meets are great to just
run against a little competition
to see where you’re at and what
you need to adjust in the weeks to
come.”

The teams have many
strengths, ranging from coaching
to age.

After W&L went into the
locker room at half-time with a
29-28 lead, the Eagles stormed
out quickly in the second half,
eventually taking a nine point
lead with about fourteen minutes
remaining. The Generals eventu-
ally closed the gap and tied the
game with about eight minutes
remaining.

Emily Wolff eventually put,

W&L ahead for good when she
hit a lay-up with 1:33 left to play,
and the team hit four free throws
down the stretch’ to seal the win.

W&L kicked off the three
game home stand on Tuesday
night against two-time defending
conference champion Randolph-
Macon.

Though the Yellow Jackets no

longer have All-American guard
Megan Silva, they still managed
to defeat Washington and Lee 75-
64. The Generals simply could
not ﬁnd a way to stop sophomore
Lindsay Riesbeck as she piled up
26 points. Riesbeck scored Ma-
con’s ﬁrst eight points and helped
the Yellow Jackets jump out to a
quick lead that they would never
relinquish.

During the second half W&L
twice got the deﬁcit down to ﬁve
points, but both times costly tum-
overs hurt the team. With the
score 43-38 in Macon’s favor,
W&L missed an easy transition

lay-up and then surrendered a"

quick basket on defense.

The loss was the Generals’
twelfth in a row at the hands of
the Yellow Jackets and it snapped
a two game winning streak for

is our coaching. You can’t ﬁnd a
better coaching staff anywhere,
and I swear by that,” Castle said.
“Coach Hoey would have and
should have been the coach of the
year every year since he’s been
here, except for the fact that we
haven’t won conference. That
will change.”

The Generals beneﬁt by hav-
ing a very young team.

Doombos said, “The girls team
has really gained some depth in a
bunch of events. We have some
new sophomore throwers on the
team that really add to the strength
of the girls team too.”

As the indoor season contin-
ues on, the team has high expec-
tations.

“With Hoey’s coaching and
recruiting skills combined with
our current athletes ability and
growth potential, I think the sky
is the limit,” Castle said.

W&L.

After several quiet games,
Hunsinger turned in a sterling per-
formance for the losing side. She
led W&L with 19 points and also
grabbed 10 rebounds. Most im-
pressive of all, Hunsinger scored
her points by hitting eight of the
10 shots she took.

The nine blocks Hunsinger
tallied on Thursday night were
just one part of a dominating box
score. She also scored 18 points
while grabbing a season-high 15
rebounds.

Her points, along with 24 from
junior forward Kristen Krouchick,
helped the Generals withstand
the 28 point night from Baldwin
guard Jessica Carter.

Carter used a variety of moves
and some deadly outside shooting
to help her team stay in the game.

Matt Harrison competes in last weekend’s Marietta
Open. Harrison led all W&L runners in the 500 meter

dash with a time of 1:11.70.

She entered the contest averaging
nearly 18 points per appearance.

W&L coach Mandy King said
Carter is always a tough player to
guard.

“You just cannot guard her
one-on-one,” King said. “You
rely on help defense and deny her
the ball as much as possible.”

Krouchick and King both said
they were excited by Hunsinger’s
performance.

“The blocks by Jessica give
us momentum, which helps us
when we’re not hitting shots,”
Krouchick said.

King said Hunsinger has re-
cently faced some of the league’s
toughest defenses, and she pre-
dicted that the senior would ﬁnish
strong down the stretch.

If Hunsinger plays like this
down the stretch, she’ll be very

tough to stop,” King said.

The Generals ~ as they often
have this year — struggled to pro-
tect the ball in both games. They
had 24 turnovers against the Yel-
low Jackets and 21 against the
Fighting Squirrels.

Carter had six steals against
W&L during Thursday night’s
game.

“[Mary Baldwin] brings great
pressure,” King said. “I think
there was a brief lack of focus
on our part, but once we adjusted
we were able to get good looks in
transition.”

The Generals will be on the
road this weekend traveling to
Guilford College on Tuesday
night before heading just a few
miles down Route 60 Thursday
evening for a 7:00 pm. tip-off at
Southern Virginia.

  Training trip unites team

Swimming team travels to Florida over break and gets tips from two Olympic Champions

SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee
University men’s and women’s
swimming teams faced a different
opponent in the pool over holiday
break, a 10-time Olympic cham-
pion.

Gary Hall Jr. helped the Gen-
erals train as part of their train-
ing to Key Largo, Fla. and even
agreed to race against some of the
men on the swimming team in a
50 meter race.

Hall Jr. and ﬁve-time Olympic
medal Jon Olsen helped to coach
the Generals in two practices dur-
ing the week-long trip.

During one of the practice
sessions, Hall Jr. agreed to race
against senior All~American
Mike Ginder and juniors Tim Mc-
Glaston and Alex Sweet. Ginder
won the 50 meter freestyle race,

to taking positions of leadership,
often under unexpected situa-
tions. In high school in Chatham,
New Jersey, Bienemann stepped
in as the goalie on the varsity soc-
cer team with little prior experi-
ence.

He also starred on the lacrosse
team and was named third team
all-state basketball in New Jersey,
notching 500 points his senior
season.

Bienemann is also a leader off
the court. An economics major,
Phi Kap, and ODAC Scholar Ath-
lete, Bienemann was also a mem-
ber of the Dean’s List Fall Term.

Bienemann has always shown
intensity on the court. A quiet fist
pump aﬁer hitting a last-second
shot during the ﬁrst half of the
game against Emory and Henry
shows the focus that he carries to
every game.

However, the problem has
sometimes been harnessing that
intensity for the good of the
team.

Said Coach Anderson, “We
always knew he could play, scor-
ing was never a problem, but the
challenge was getting him to cut
turnovers and creating opportuni-
ties for teammates.”

This season, it seems that this
challenge is beginning to be over-
come. “Guys have been willing
to sacriﬁce some of their numbers
to get the ball to Greg,” said An-
derson. “It’s a group effort, and
because of him, everyone is doing
the little things better... As good
of a player he is, he’s an even bet-
ter teammate.”

Yesterday afternoon, Biene-
marm tied his career-high for
point scored in a game when he
added 33 points in the Generals
84-67 victory over Lynchburg.

Bienemann is now averag-
ing 22 points per game and 6.7
rebounds per game. He’s putting
himself into strong contention for
ODAC player of the year.

The Generals face Eastern
Mennonite on the road on Wednes-
day. Their next home game is Sat-
urday night versus Roanoke.

Olympian. Sweet and Hall Jr.
touched the wall in a tie.

Senior captain Abbie Sauter
said, “It was incredibly interest-
ing to hear what they valued about
swimming and their take on rac-
ing, competition, practice, etc.”

And while some people spent
their holiday breaks relaxing, the
Generals were hard at work.

Sophomore Susan Mahoney
said, “The training trip is physi-
cally demanding. The practices
are tough, but having such great
teammates helps me get through
them.”

“Everyone on the team sup-
ports each other. We have a good
time together,” Mahoney contin-
ued.

The fact that the team was
practicing in Florida made the
week a bit more enjoyable. I

“The practices are very in-

tense, but the nice location helps V

us keep positive attitudes,” soph-

“As the sole senior woman on the team, I will

bite oﬁ’ my own arms-and beat Randy Mac to

death with them, before I will lose our 13 year

long ODAC winning streak. ”

ABBIE SAUTER, Senior Captain

omore Lindsey Strachan said.

Sauter said, “Not only were
we swimming for four hours a
day on some days, we were also
doing dryland workouts in 80 de-
gree weather.”

The team headed to Florida to
focus on their training in order to
preparefor the later half of the
season and conference champion-
ships.

“The purpose of the training
trip is to get us in really good
shape for the conference meet
somewhere we can focus on
swimminggand nothing else for a

few weeks,” junior Amy Rober-
son said.

As the women’s season con-
tinues, they have one goal, a four-
teenth consecutive ODAC cham-
pionship. But before the ODAC
championships, they will have
three dual meets against Hopkins,
Marymount, and Hollins.

Sauter said, “Hopkins is an
extremely competitive team that
will be fun to race against, but we
have the ability to dominate both
Marymount and Hollins and I am
excited to see the team rise to the
occasion and get that done.”

The Generals have developed a
rivalry with Randolph Macon this
season. After the Generals were
defeated by the Yellow Jackets at
a dual-meet earlier in the season,
the team has trained hard in prep-
aration of the ODAC champion-
ships where they will again get to
face off against R-MC.

Sauter said, “As the sole senior
woman on the team, I will bite off
my own arms and beat Randy
Mac to death with them before I
will lose our 13 year long ODAC
winning strea .”

After the dual meet between
RMC earlier in the season, a
swimmer from RMC posted a
quote on one of her teammate’s
facebook walls about “breaking
the tradition” that the Generals
have held at the ODAC champi-
onships.

“A newly added pump up
routine we have is to smack the
quote before each practice since
it hangs inside the door of our

locker room,” Sauter said. “See-
ing that sign daily reminds all of
us how excited we need to get
about [maintaining] the tradition
of winning at ODAC’s.”

Overall, the women’s swim-
ming team is a tight-knit group of
swimmers who are truly united as
a team, and the training trip only
brought the team closer together.

Freshman Sarah Simpson said,
“It was awesome to be able to
hang out with a group of people
that I like so much without having
to worry about school work and
all the other things that are usu-
ally stressing us out.

Sauter added, “The entire team
gets so much out of a little over a
week of training and it also brings
the team so much closer because
we all have to get through it to-
gether.”

Simpson said, “[The goals
are] to win ODAC’s, reset all the
school-record relay records, and
qualify for Nationals.”

STAFF WRITER

Time was winding down, and
Washington and Lee needed a
change of momentum. Tied at 78
with Emory and Henry College
with less than eight minutes to
play, the Generals were struggling
to hold off a conference opponent
that had rallied from ﬁfteen points
down. An E&H guard drove past
his defender, his path to the bas-
ket unobstructed. Suddenly, ju-
nior forward Greg Bienemann left
the man he was guarding, stepped
in front of the guard, and drew a
charge.

When asked for one moment
that deﬁned Greg Bienemann as a
player and a person, Washington

and Lee Head Basketball Coach
Adam Hutchinson pointed to this
charge, the most unselﬁsh, self-
sacriﬁcing action in the game of
basketball.

The Generals would go on to
defeat Emory and Henry 98-96,
spurred by 30 points and 13 re-
bounds from Bienemann, includ-
ing an offensive board that set up
the game-winning basket.

“I’d say that’s how Greg is a
leader,” said Hutchinson. “He
makes a point of taking care of his
teammates on the court.”

Bienemann did not respond to
several requests for comment.

Through this leadership, and
through what Coach Hutchinson
cites as “improved team execu-
tion,” W&L is off to its best start

in recent memory. Their 4-4 con-
ference record (9-5 overall) places
them fourth in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference, exceeding
the expectations of the coaches
who picked them to ﬁnish ninth.

Freshman John Twomey cred-
its the fast start to veteran lead-
ership. “The older guys really
know the system. It makes it a
challenge to stand out as a fresh-
man.”

And much of this leadership
has come from Bienemann. The
numbers are impressive: his 21.5
points per game is second in the
conference, but Bienemann’s
greatest inﬂuence on the team
cannot be measured by what ap-
pears in the stat book. Whether
it’s taking a foul while helping
out on defense, creating scoring
opportunities for teammates or
drawing a charge, what Coach
Anderson calls the “little things.”

“One of the problems Greg has
had this year is foul trouble,” said
Anderson. “He’ll step in when
one of the guys up top gets beaten
of the ball.”

Bienemann is no stranger

Women is basketball
team defeats a
nationally ranked
opponent for the

first time in history

By Jacob Gelger
MANAGING EDITOR

The women’s basketball team
made history Saturday night when
they defeated No. 24 Bridgewater
College 65-60. The win marked
the ﬁrst time that the women’s
team has beaten a ranked oppo-
nent.

The win came two days after
Center Jessica Hunsinger tallied
nine blocks against the Mary
Baldwin Fighting Squirrels, just
missing a triple-double but eas-
ily setting the school record for
blocks. Hunsinger set the tone by
blocking three shots by Baldwin
center Erica Dabney during the
ﬁrst 30 seconds of the game.

Washington and Lee withstood
a late Mary Baldwin rally and
came away with a 64-54 victory.

The victory over Bridgewater
was as surprising as it was impor-
tant. The Eagles entered the game
with a 12-2 record and a 9-1 mark
in conference play. The Generals,
in contrast, were 6-8 with a 3-7
conference record before playing
Bridgewater.

When the two teams met ear-
lier this year, Bridgewater handed
Washington and Lee a resounding
78-56 defeat. Senior Shannan
Scales, who scored a career high
25 points in the team’s ﬁrst meet-
ing, was held scoreless on Satur-
day by W&L’s relentless defense.

Kristen Krouchick led the
Generals on the offensive end,
scoring 22 points. Hunsinger and
Amanda Kane both added eight
points.

Hunsinger also pulled down
a season-high 17 rebounds, and
Krouchick came up with 10.

The Generals took advantage
of a lopsided free throw margin,
going to the line 31 times and
making 19 of those attempts.
Bridgewater, in contrast, , only
got 15 chances from the charity
stripe.
