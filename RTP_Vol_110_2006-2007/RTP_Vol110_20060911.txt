Virginia cracks
down on minors

State tougherzs penalties for
underage alcohol possession

By Jacob Geiger
NEWS armor:

Students across Virginia
who drink underage face a new
penalty this school year: the
mandatory loss of their driver’s
license for at least six months.

The Virginia state legislature
beefed up underage drinking
laws last February after Del-
egate Brian Moran, D-Alexan-
dria, introduced a pair of bills in
the Virginia Legislature.

One bill makes it illegal
for adults to serve alcohol to
minors who are guests in their
homes.

The other bill, which passed
unanimously in the State Senate
and by an 88-10 margin in the
House of Delegates, mandates
a six-month loss of a minor’s
driver’s license if the person is
convicted of possession or con-
sumption of alcohol.

Along with the suspension
of license, the minor also faces
a mandatory $500 ﬁne or 50
hours of community service.

The bill passed the state sen— ,

ate on Feb. 28 but only recently
came to the attention of univer-
sity oﬂicials across Virginia.

“We found out after the
law passed,” Dean of Students
Dawn Watkins said. “It hit ad-
ministrators around the state by
surprise.”

Watkins also said Washing-
ton and Lee’s legal counsel, Le-
anne M. Shank, did not know
the law was under consideration
until after it had been passed.

Dean Watkins and Matt
Krieg, Chairman of the Student
Judicial Council, sent a letter to
all students and parents inform-

ing them of the new laws.

In their letter, Watkins and
Krieg noted that if the new laws
had been in place last year, 15
students could have faced the
loss of their driver’s license.

Michael Young, W&L’s Di-
rector of Campus Security, said
his department, along with Wat-
kins and Krieg, has told every-
one they can possibly tell.

“Word has gotten out,”
Young said. “The freshmen
have been told two or three
times at least that it’s illegal to
drink underage.”

Since Virginia’s new law is
stricter than the minor-in-pos-
session laws of most states,
Young said some confusion
exists over what will happen if
out-of-state students have their
licenses suspended.

“Some states have reciprocal
agreements and might suspend
your license at home, but other
states might not acknowledge
Virginia’s suspension. Either
way you still won’t be allowed
to drive in Virginia.”

Young said the state “wants
to indicate they are getting
tough on underage drinking,”

Lexington Police Chief
Steve Crowder agreed with
Young’s assertion.

“My understanding was that
so much underage drinking
was going on that the penalties
weren’t stiff enough,” Crowder
said.

“I have a 17-year-old son
and when I told him about
the new laws, he said that this
would deﬁnitely get kid’s atten-
tion.”

Crowder said that he is not
sure if the penalties will stop

He also said that the new laws
will not cause the police depart-
ment to increase, decrease or in
any way change the way they
patrol.

Crowder did say that under-
age possession citations have
become more common.

“We had three in August of

2006 versus zero in August of
2005. In all of 2004 there were
three and in all of 2005 there
were four, so we had as many
last month as we had in the en-
tire year of 2004.”

In 2005, local law enforce-
ment officers issued 59 cita-
tions for liqour law violations.
The number of violations in

.§-—'

2004 was 38.

Though ‘Virginia legislators
hope to cut down on underage
drinking, Watkins said she was
not sure if this law was the way
to solve that problem.

“I’m not sure ifthis is a pos-
itive step; it seems like a regres-
sive move to me.”

T hirr/CF ast and PlayF air draw mixed reviews from freshmen

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

A small group of freshman
confronted dorm counselors and
residential life staff when they
tried to walk outnof an orientation
event Monday night.

The students were trying to
leave the trivia game “Thinkfast,”
held at Lenfest.

Head dorm counselor Sam
Wilmoth said, “I think that some
of the [dorm counselors] were
a little confused and hurt by the
way they were treated by those
students.”

Wilmoth said that the students’
actions can be explained by the
stress of being in a new place.
He said that the problems may be

caused by the adjustment to a new
environment and having to meet
so many new people. “It’s easy to
fall back on becoming sarcastic
and getting an attitude,” he said.

He said that the staff was
caught off guard by how quickly
those feelings manifested in the
students concerned.

“The actions of those few indi-
viduals at ThinkFast just weren’t
in keeping with the high standards
of civility we hold ourselves to,
and to be yelled at and ignored by
those individuals caught some of
us off guard,” Wilmoth said.

One of the more prevalent
complaints from students was
that many failed to understand
how some of the activities ﬁt their
ideas of what orientation week

should be.

“O-week is all about meeting
people,” said freshman Diana
Cianciotta, but pointed out that
the “ThinkFast” activity hindered
that.

“I think that out of all the
events, only “PlayFair” did that. It
was corny, but pretty effective.”

A freshman, who wished to re-
main anonymous to avoid further
conﬂict, agreed that PlayF air was
most effective. “It was a better
get-to-know-you event than any
of the others,” the student said,
but added, “I felt like we were be-
ing sort of talked dovm to.”

“It was ridiculously difﬁcult
to meet people,” Ciancotta said.
“The music was so loud that it
was tough to understand what the

person next to you was saying, let
alone meet them.”

Dean David Leonard said,
“Orientation is not simply de-
signed for new students to meet
one another. It is also an opportu-
nity to introduce new community
members to the academic and co-
curricular aspects of the Univer-
sity.”

One freshman was particularly
peeved that some of the dorm
counselors were competing for a
share of the $200 cash prize for
the event.

“It’s supposed to be a freshman
event, and it’s mandatory, but we
can’t even compete amongst our-
selves for the prizes?” the student
said. “We have to compete with
these upperclassmen who’ve
done it before? Explain to me
how that’s right.”

The walkout have

may

David Leonard said. “Unfor-

tunately, the event didn’t start_

promptly and should have con-
cluded 15 minutes earlier.” He
said that a "timely start would have
helped avoid conﬂict.

At some events, Leonard said,
“it was evident that some mem-
bers of the class were tired, disen-
gaged, and wanting to go party.”

Leonard said that although the
social scene is “both important
and enjoyable,” it is important to
reiterate the primary reasons for
going to college in the ﬁrst place.

When discussing what they
liked about the week’s events,
several students regarded the
Tuesday night discussion on race
and diversity as “very interest-
ing,” and “compelling.”

national
awards

W&L is online
Rockbridge Report
named runner—up

By Melissa Caron
oesrcn nmscron

This summer the “Rockbridge
Report” was named one of the top
three online student newspapers
in the country by the Society of
Professional Journalists.

The publication, which is pro-
duced weekly by classes within
the journalism department dur-
ing fall and winter term, was
awarded the “Mark of Excellence
Award,” for the work students did
in 2005. ‘

Professor Doug Cumming,
who teaches the Reporting for
Print Media class, related that this

award was a true testament to the .

success of the online publication.

“There is a difference between
awards given to journalists by
journalists and marketplace suc-
cess,” Cumming said. “You wish
they were the same thing.”

The “Rockbridge Report,”
covers news within Lexington
and Rockbridge County. While it
is produced by students, the gen-
eral audience of the publicationis
the surrounding community.

Journalism Professor Clau- i

dette Artwick teaches two of the
classes responsible for the pro-
duction of the publication.

“I don’t know that we have
lots of student exposure and inter-
est,” Artwick said. “People in the
community are really what we’re
aimed at.”

Cumming points out that the
real intention of the “Rockbridge
Report” is not increased reader-
ship but rather education, and lit-
tle has been done to promote the
publication.

“This is real news, covering
Rockbridge County,” Cumming
said. “At the same time our pur-
pose is education.”

Several other classes, such as

with near universal praise. “Burr
Datz is the coolest guy alive,”
asserted ‘one freshman after the
program.

Some found the program’s
closing song “I Got Drunk (and I
Missed It)” to be ironically hip.

(Much to the dismay of this
reporter, it is a Burr Datz original,
and is thus not on iTunes ~ yet.)

Overall, despite the one disso- -

nant event at “Thinkfast,” wide-
spread approval seemed to be the
norm.
Wilmoth said, “There will al-
ways be mistakes and problems,
but I think to just look at those
who messed up and to transpose
those incidents over the entire
class would be a mistake.”

One anonymous freshman

agreed. “l’ve had the time of my ’ -

life this week,” the student said.
“lt’s awesome.”

Old Co-Op begins new
life as faculty ofﬁces

Six-million dollar project aimed at relieving oﬂice space crunch

By Wesley 0’Dell
STAFF WRITER

Students returning to W&L
after a summer hiatus were sur-
prised to ﬁnd their beautiful cam-
pus tumed into a construction
zone.

The area between the Graham-
Lees courtyard and Huntley Hall
looked especially different. The
old Co-Op building is undergoing
a nearly-$6 million makeover.

According to Joseph Grasso,
Vice President for Administration,
the 95-year-old structure is being
completely gutted and renovated
to create additional ofﬁce space.
This is in response to the recent
faculty expansion that left many
new hires without an ofﬁce close
to their classrooms.

Vice President Grasso says the
project, which began on the day
after graduation, will create 22
new offices for faculty of both the
Williams School and the College,
some of whom have been forced
to work out of the Early-Fielding
building.

Constructed in 1911, the old
Co-Op is a place of fond memo-
ries for many alumni.

The fact that the Co-Op is be-
ing remodeled to continue serving
the campus is, according to Gras-
so, an example of the “history of
W&L and the value the buildings
have in maintaining the character
of the campus.”

The construction has been
characterized as “mildly dis-
ruptive” by some freshmen in
Graham-Lees, who complain of
noise throughout the day. Others
reported that the work caused no
disruption to their day.

The old Co-op, originally
built in 1911, gets a little
re-vamping this year.

The project’s completion is
slated for July 2007. In addition
to the remodeling of the build-
ing itself by Glavé and Holmes, a
Richmond ﬁrm which specializes
in academic buildings, a land-
scape architect will be brought
in this summer to redesign the
grounds around Huntley Hall.

In the interim, the University
will be putting down sod at the
end of September to spruce up the
area.

Although the production of a
television news channel has been
a part of the department since the
1970s, the web version was not

and realized this was the direction
it was moving it,” Artwick said.

with the skills they’ve learning.
Combining resources can be won-
derful but it’s also stressful.”

The Society of Professional
Journalists is a not-for-proﬁt or-
ganization that is dedicated to
upholding freedom of press and
ethics amongst publications na-
tionally.

“The recognition by the SPJ
is an indication we’re doing our
job,” Artwick said.

The road to gaining national
recognition began last year when
the department sent in copies of
the online publication. From here
the “Rockbridge Report” was
judged against other publications
from its region.

The SPJ separates the na-
tion,.\into twelve regions by state.
Washington and Lee resides in re-
gion two and w\asup a ainst other
colleges from VirgirY1a,gi/Iaryland,
North Carolina, Delaware, and
the District of Columbia.

Last spring at the SPJ’s region-
al conference the “Rockbridge
Report” was awarded ﬁrst place
in its region. From here it was
judged against all other ﬁrst place
publications from each region and
was eventually named one of the
two national ﬁnalists at the SPJ
Convention and National Journal-
ism Conference held in Chicago
this summer.

First place was taken by “The
Lantern Online,” which is pro-
duced by students at Ohio State
University. The Rockbridge Re-
port,” shared the ﬁnalist position
with “The Independent Florida
Alligator,” from the University of
Florida. Publications were judged
based upon several criteria, in-
cluding accuracy, ingenuity, cre-
ativity, and adherence to the SPJ ’s
code of ethics.

When the students of two re-
porting classes responsible for
the “Rockbridge Report” met this
fall, they sat around a long con-
ference table. There were only
seven of them, normal for this

usually small class. It was a lab
day, so the two classes were being
held together. .
In the classroom students use
a textbook and discuss general is-
sues about newspaper production.
Students are then able to take this
theoretical and academic side and
apply it to their work during lab.
Cumming and Professor Rob-
ert deMaria, who teaches the Re-
porting for Electronic Media, sat
with students at the table, much as
if this were an actual meeting for
a professional newsroom. Cum-
ming suggested that everyone go
around and introduce themselves

and tell what they did over the
summer. Student resumes proved
impressive as most went on to de-
scribe internships they had held
over the summer, ranging from
jobs held at Reuters and Bloom-
berg to writing for local newspa-
pers.

“We’ve got» some high pow-
ered people in here. This is great,”
Cumming said, growing more
enthusiastic as the conversation
moved around the table.

“We’re going to cook here!
We’re going to cover Rockbridge
County like it’s never been cov-
ered.”

The book-buying routine used

there are few.
Some stu-

dents sell used books over Cam-
pus Notices. From last year to this
year, the number of notices sell-
ing textbooks has tripled. They
all offer books at cheaper prices
than the campus bookstore.
Online sites have also become
more popular. They allow stu-
dents to comparison-shop for spe-
ciﬁc textbooks and ﬁnd cheaper
versions of the book in earlier
editions or paperback.
In a 2006 study commis-
sioned by the Virginia General

' Assembly, students who shopped

for textbooks online saved a mini-
mum of 20 to 40 percent.

Web sites like Amazon.com
tack on additional discounts dur-
ing peak seasons in August and
December.

Still, according to the study,
over 77 percent of students at-
tending Virginia colleges shop
exclusively at their university’s
bookstore, usually because book
lists for their courses were not
available elsewhere.

Last year, Virginia21, a youth-_
oriented action group, stepped in:
The group successfully lobbied
to make book-buying more af-
fordable and end the monopolies’
bookstores hold on most campus-
es. Last summer, the Textbook

place.

Public colleges in Virginia
now have to post book lists as
soon as professors submit them.
They must be in a visible place
and available to students well be-

of Higher Education reports 17
other states have enacted similar
legislation.

As a private institution, W&L
is not subject to the act. For stu-
dents to ﬁnd book lists, they must
work for them.

That was Allison Rogers’ plan.

needed to buy. Some responded;
some did not.

“So it was easier to go to the
bookstore and buy there,” said
Rogers, after her failed attempts,
“even though I hate how expen-
sive it is.”

The State Council for Higher
Education reports a quarter of stu-
dents spend over $1,000 on text-
books each year. Average costs
are about $400 each semester, and
the council predicts prices are on
the rise.

Washington and Lee students

BRANDON DOTSON, Assoclate Dean of Students

Riviere is excited to ﬁnd a simi-
lar university that allows him to
pursue both of his professional
passions—teaching and research.
Although he expresses his excite-
ment for getting to know students
as the year progresses, he has, so
far, been most impressed with his
colleagues.

“They are all extremely smart,
and good at what they do. But
they’re also great to hang out with
and just grab a cup of coffee.”

Along with assisting the
university’s numerous pre-med
students, he hopes to increase
interest in research careers for
W&L students in science majors.
The university has committed to
expanding faculty in several de-
partments.

straying from the speaking tradition

Three ways W&L students try to avoid talking with strangers and students they meet on the street

Members of the W&L community have been

decrying the supposed demise of the speaking

tradition for decades, but Grace Andrew has

noticed that today’s students employ some sly

tricks to subtly escape the tradition of talking.

By Grace Andrews
c o L u M N I sr

“Hey,” “How are you?” “Hel-
10,” ‘‘What’s up?”

These are a few of the ways
that many faculty and students
greet one another, or at least are
supposed to.

Today’s topic is the speaking
tradition here at Washington and
Lee. Our
speak-
ing tradi-
tion is the
stuff of
legends:
the notion
that ev-
eryone on
this cam-
pus will
speak to anyone they see regard-
less of familiarity.

Disappointingly, this is not
always the case. There are ‘some
of us here in the W&L commu-
nity who participate a little more
actively than others, so much so
that I have created my own list of
“avoidance” techniques and how
they are used.

Before I begin, I must warn the
readers: you may identify these as
actions that you do on a daily ba-
sis. My goal is not to offend, only
to create awareness. If you are

offended, you know why. Since
I cannot speak for others, I will
only use my experiences to illus-
trate the lack of “speaking” that I
have sometimes encountered.

The ﬁrst technique is the
“Watch My Every Step.” This
technique usually begins from
about 200 yards away, when the
person realizes that you are walk-
ing in their direction and begins
to strangely look down.

It may seem to the untrained
eye that this person is one of the
most discreet and ambiguous
mammals on the campus, other-
wise known as the shy or quiet
kid.

The truth is that this person is
now watching their footwork so
meticulously that one would think
that an intense game of “Step on
a Crack, Break your Mother’s
Back” was being played, in

.— which if they stepped on a crack. 4

their mom would mysteriously
turn into a female version of Qua-
simodo.

In reality, the Foot Watcher is
just avoiding greeting you, and
what ever the reason you are left
smiling and greeting the lovely
scalp of some random stranger.
Let’s just hope they’re not suffer-
ing from male pattern baldness or
a severe case of dandruff.

The next technique is the “Cell

Phone.” I really love this one, es-
pecially because of the hilarity I
see in this avoidance method. The
“Cell Phone” usually begins at
about a 100 yards from you.

The Cell Phone Poser will
pretend that their cell phone is
ringing, vibrating or sending dog
whistle like sound waves to their
car, especially since no one else
seems to hear the ring or see any
kind of vibrations.

The Cell Phone Poser will then
proceed with a fake conversation,
usually with their “Mother” or be-
loved “Granny.” Lord knows that
the only person they’re talking to
is themselves or their imaginary
friends, or maybe the voices in
their head are ﬁnally talking back.
If they don’t pretend to “talk,” the
Cell Phone Poser will pretend to
be actually making a call. That part
kills me because of the amount of
numbers they decide to dial. Most
numbers are seven digits, ten if
the area code is included. So, to
see someone literally punch about
twenty-ﬁve different keys makes
me suspicious.

Now, if they aren’t using a
calling card and calling a foreign
country, there is absolutely no
reason to be pressing every num-
ber combo known to the human
race.

*This:technique is probably the*»
hardest to, pull of since the Cell
Phone Poser forgets to even turn
on their phone at times.

I mean, seriously. When was
the last time you saw a solar pow-
ered phone? That’s right: never!
It’s not cute when I walk by and
see that the little power light isn’t
even on.

Last but not least is the most
common of techniques: darty
eyes. The Eye Darter will usually

be able to see you from a variety
of distances.

Upon making initial eye con-
tact, they will then begin to look
all over the place, as if they were
reenacting a Stevie Wonder per-
formance, or they might even do
the “straight-ahead.”

When this happens, the Eye
Darter just looks straight ahead,
avoiding your glance and dis-
abling their peripheral vision un-
til they get past you and start to
“magically” regain their vision
and greet the people they know
directly behind you. This recent-
ly happened to me, I know, me of
all people! I’m just kidding.

I really did encounter an Eye
Darter, whose darting eyes hurt
my feelings and made me wonder
about the state of our speaking
tradition.

Here’s the story: As a friend and
I walked toward the school from
the direction of Sweet Things,
we saw a young man walking to-
wards us. At this time, we were
about 100 yards from him. All of
a sudden he got really jittery and
started to look up and down really
quickly and awkwardly with big
giant head motions.

I got really confused and real-
ized that he was trying to avoid
speaking to us. Being the type A

“personality*that' I am; I" greeted“

him with a simple “hello,” and my
friend with a “hey.” The young
man mumbled something that
may have been somewhere in the
family of hello and then walked
away so quickly you would have
thought he was an Olympic speed
walker.

I mean, honestly, this boy’s eyes
were darting up and and down so
quickly you would have thought
that I had just asked him to be my

The Cell Phone Poser will then proceed
with a fake conversation, usually with
their “Mother” or beloved “Granny. ”
Lord knows that the only person they ’re
talking to is themselves or their imagi-
nary friends, or maybe the voices in their
head are ﬁnally talking back.

baby’s daddy and pay child sup-
port in the ﬁve digit range. It was
really strange and my friend and
I were extremely hurt, confused,
and a bit offended. We couldn’t
ﬁgure out why this guy had acted
so strangely. I would like to say
it was because he had never seen
creatures as lovely as us, but the
truth is we don’t know why. The
manner in which he acted and
mumbled hello was so offensive,
he would have been better olf not
saying anything at all.

But no matter the reason, all
of these techniques and the other
ones that are out there are abso-
lutely urmecessary. So what if you
are shy or get nervous around new
people? All you have to do is say
ﬁelron. . . . .-.. . _.

No one is telling you to stop
a person and get their life story,
complete with baby pictures and
ﬁrst kiss stories. It’s not that criti-
cal. But from some of these tech-
niques, you would really think
that people were going to ask you
to put your ﬁrst born child into the
creek and ﬂoat them to the law
school or something.

Something as simple as say-
ing “Hi” shouldn’t make anyone

break out into convulsions and
nervous ﬁts, and that’s simply the
truth of the matter. Speaking is a
polite and simple way to improve
someone’s day and even your
own.

Some of you may be wonder-
ing what the point of this article
was since all I seem to be doing
is criticizing.

BUT, I criticize to make a
point. Let me put it this way, if the
speaking tradition were an animal,
it would be an endangered species
on the verge of extinction.

Maybe we would even call
it Speakenus Traditionalus (that
would be the Latin name, of
course) and it would be one of
ten still left on the planet with
its ecosystem being cut down for
lumber.

Sounds pretty grim, doesn’t
it?

As funny as that may sound, if
we the W&L community are not
careful, the Speaking Tradition of
this institution will become a side
note of the past.

Just another “good ‘ol days”
memory that your children will
never have the honor or pleasure
to experience or understand.

Bush and the

  prison of secrets

What Voldemort taught George Bush about torture

By Dylan Merrlll
c o L u M N I sr

Don’t get me wrong, I love
prisons. How could you not ap-
preciate such a cultural conver-
gence of nonconforrnists and free
thinkers?

These prisoners are only try-
ing to compensate for their past
mistakes, and maybe make a few
license plates in the process. Un-
fortunately, however, the era of
color-coordinated gang members
and candy-dispensing drug deal-
ers has gone by the wayside.

Last Wednesday, President
Bush announced the existence of
several secret CIA prisons across
Europe facilitate the interrogation
of terrorism suspects (most assur-
edly in a lawful manner).

In order to save face, Bush
also made public that some of
these secret suspects are being
transferred out of the clandestine
facilities.

The suspects should take com-
fort in knowing that they will get
a change of venue. Prisoners can
go from their European getaways
to the tropical Guantanamo Bay
Penitentiary - where inmates are
illegally held. Nice upgrade.

Unfortunately for the transfer-
ees, the Supreme Court recently
condemned the federal prisons’
practice of “altemative” methods
of extracting infomration from
unhelpful suspects, particularly

the use of extreme temperatures
and “waterboarding,” which is
used to make prisoners believe
they are drowning.

I’m sure the new inmates will
feel cheated when they arrive in
Cuba, only to be denied the fun in
the sun and exciting water sports
that such a beautiful island of-
fers.

The Bush administration has
not disclosed the locations of the
secret prisons, nor has it pledged
to no longer make use of the Nazi-
esque facilities.

Now, we cannot even have
the privilege of ﬁnding these un-
lawful institutions on our globes.
Where are they? Prague? The
Rhine Valley? Auschwitz?

The international commu-
nity has condemned these under-
ground interrogation facilities.
Even American allies have spoken
out. Last week, German Chancel-
lor Angela Merkel, who has been
desperately trying to strengthen
the relationship between the
two nations, criticized the Bush
administration, saying that the
government is “calling our funda-
mental beliefs into question.”

Hmm... the German chancel-
lor is wary of Gestapo tactics and
Secret Police interrogations... I

‘guess we can take some comfort

in knowing that one of the major
world powers can learn from his-
tory.

Alas, this all seems like a Har-

ry Potter novel gone awry. Har-
ry (the Secret Prisoner) is taken
from captivity at the Dursley’s
(Secret Prison X) by Hermione
and Ron (the CIA) and trans-
ported via the Hogwarts Express
(high-capacity cargo aircraft)
to Hogwarts (Guantanamo
Bay), only to ﬁnd the uniform
has changed to black and white
stripes and his Gryfﬁndor dorm
room no longer has windows.

It was that evil Voldemort
(George Bush) that broke Har-
ry’s wand and shut him in soli-
tary conﬁnement, all because
Harry has a penchant for wearing
turbans and hiding underground
for long periods of time.

This is not okay. I want to go
back to the more innocent days
of penal institutions, when peo-
ple didn’t have to worry about
running into terrorists while va-
cationing in the Swiss Alps. Yet,
The Powers That Be have trans-
formed our beloved penal sys-
tem into a series of illusions and
facades, where torture is likely
and invasions of civil liberties
are counted on.

The international community
has spoken out against these
violations, but no changes have
occurred.

These days, the secrecy and
lies of our government are all
too common. What will it take
to correct the mistakes of the
Voldemort administration?

 

Why we’re letting  

the readers decide ~

Police blotter column comes to a close after debates

V In January, we gave ourselves
a new mission.

We vowed to turn ourselves
around.

We made promises to the com-
munity about accuracy and rel-
evancy, and used our newfound
professionalism to test the bound-
aries of journalism.

We were not always met with
approval, but through 18 weeks
we honed our technique.

Now that we have a ﬁrm foun-
dation, we hope to expand our
abilities and use them to better
serve our readers.

Last year, we ran a feature

called “Behind Bars.”
A police blotter, “Behind
Bars” documented the arrests

made each week by Lexington
police ofﬁcers.

Similar columns run in many
campus newspapers—~in fact, in
newspapers of all types.

Readers responded resound-
ingly both for and against the
column. It brought more mail to
our inbox than has been seen in
years.

Most importantly, it stimulated
an intellectual discussion in our
community.

We received (and often printed)
many reasonable civic opinions
about whether we should make

In the past few months, both sides have had

their say. We ’ve editorialized about the journal-

istic reasons for printing it, and we ’ve proven

the legality of our actions.

public record so, well, public.

Members across the commu-
nity responded with their ideas
about protection and information
and where the line between them
should be drawn.

Sadly, not all of the discussion
was intellectual.

The reporter assigned to write
the column faced a daily onslaught
of hate mail and harassment.

He was threatened in the din-
ing hall, and confronted at par-
ties-—someone even trashed his
dorm room.

Ungentlemanly, no?

Despite these inappropriate
(and somewhat misdirected) criti-
cisms, the conversation went on.

Looking back at the letters we
received—the letters you wrote—~
we have decided to cancel the
column.

In the past few months, both
sides have had their say. We’ve

editorialized about the joumal-
istic reasons for printing it, and
we’ve proven the legality of our
actions.

But at the end of the day, what
you think matters.

Our mission is to serve the
readers.

We’re here for you.

And the readers have decided:
“Behind Bars” will no longer run
as a column.

Last school year, the Phi fo- .

cused on improving its journalis-
tic skills.

We have a strong core of re-
turning writers and editors. And
in the last week, we’ve gained an
eager and motivated group of new
staffers.

We’re growing every day.

Looking back, we’ve really _ .
turned ourselves around.

Class of 2010 gains early edge

New students build  Conﬁdence, self—reliance, deep
friendships, and houses during one week trips

By Jessica Shaw
SPORTS EDITOR

One-quarter of the freshmen
class bid their families farewell
a week early to embark on .an
adventure that would lead some
to the peaks of mountains in the
pouring rain and others to some
of the darkest slums of poverty in
the country. ’

According to Director of Cam-
pus Activities and Outing Club
Advisor James Dick, the Lead-

ing Edge program at Washington”

& Lee University began in 1995
with a hiking trip of less than ~15
students. Since then, the number
of freshmen participants has esca-
lated to over 150, and a volunteer
branch has been incorporated.

While the two branches are
very different, they share a com-
mon goal: to provide an intimate
environment for freshmen to be-
come comfortable and establish
deep friendships prior to the cha-
os of Orientation Week. "

“I cannot imagine what it
would have been like to show up
the ﬁrst day of move-in and not
know a soul,” participant Shan-
non Brunner said. “It would be so
uncomfortable.”

Leaders arrived on campus
two weeks early to undergo wil-
derness training, team building
activities, psychology seminars
and workshops teaching leaders
how to deal with any group dy-
namic issues. _‘ 

“I thi'r‘1k1_~:it"s3~' at big ’sacriﬁce,”

Dick said. “You’re giving up two

weeks of your summer.”

Twenty-six Appalachian Ad-
venture leaders split up to lead 81
freshmen to different parts of the
trail.

“As a freshman, my trip lead-
ers were my role models and
friends, and they certainly helped

me beyond that initial week in
terms of meeting people and ad-
justing to college,” Sophomore
trip leader Jen Lysenko said.

Eight groups of students hiked
between 25 and 38 miles in four
days, pitching tents each night
and securing tarps to shield them-
selves from the torrential rain. A
ninth group was focused on rock
climbing, but it had to tweak the
trip due to weather obstacles.

“My freshman orientation trip
at the time was the most chal-
lenging thing that I had ever
done,” Senior leader Erin Tainer
said. “On the ﬁrst day I thought
that I was never going to make it
through, physically or emotional-
ly, and I was homesick and farther
outside of my comfort zone than I
had ever been.”

According to Dick, who is cur-
rently in his ﬁfth year at W&L,
there are, on average, of 2.5 evac-
uations each year. He said evacua-
tions occur for numerous reasons,
ranging from allergic reactions to
illnesses. This year he said three
people were evacuated.

“One of our freshmen got a
serious rash that began the ﬁrst
night, and by the second morn-
ing we knew we had to evacuate
him,” Lysenko said. “The four to
ﬁve miles we had to hike to get
phone service was the most difﬁ-
cult part of the trip.”

‘ Freshman Andrea Null said
that Leading Edge was an expe-
rience tlpatgshe struggled with on-A

into college with.”

Despite physical struggles and
harsh weather conditions, Junior
leader Samantha Hishmeh said
her group bonded over campﬁre
games and activities.

“We played Maﬁa almost every
night, and we even took someone
‘snipe hunting’ one night, which
was highly entertaining to say the
least.”

According to Null, break-
fasts and dinners were cooked on
stoves at the sleep sites, and lunch
usually consisted of trail mix or
granola bars on the hike.

“Mealtime was deﬁnitely
something you looked forward
to,” Null said. “We had a set hour
that we would do it. Basically,
everybody pulled out all the food
out of our packs that we had been
packing the last three days, and it
was basically a free for all.”

Through the rain, soggy pan-
cakes and tough miles, a bond
developed between freshmen and
their mentors that made it easier
to approach freshman year, ac-
cording to participant Sarah J 0
Trimble.

“I deﬁnitely made some long-
lasting friendships on that trip,”
Trimble said. “This trip has deﬁ-
nitely inspired me to get involved
in other campus activities. I actu-
ally signed up for the Outing Club
during the activities fair.”

Simultaneously, students par-
ticipating in the Volunteer Ven-

ture program were divided into

“I don’t think I ’ve ever felt as
proud of myself after anything,”
Null said. “Every step you took,
you knew you could only do it
because of you. There was no one
helping you. You deﬁnitely had
a sense of personal gain. It was

four groups. Each group traveled
to a different location, lived sim-
ply and volunteered at sites serv-
ing children, the disabled and the
homeless.

“These trips are designed
to give incoming freshmen a
glimpse of the poverty that ex-
ists in our country,” Junior leader
Bonnie Fay said.

Students could sign up to go
to Roanoke, Va., Lexington, Va.,
War, W.V. and Greensboro, N.C.
Senior Camille Allen coordinated
the entire process and helped se-
lect 23 student leaders that were
assigned to one of the four loca-
tions.

“I wanted to provide a good
experience for incoming fresh-
men,” Sophomore coordinator
Rosemary Boyle said. “I wanted
to provide a comfortable transi-
tion from their summer to college
and at the same time have them
become engaged in the ﬁeld work
that the Shepherd Poverty Pro-
gram is all about.”

During the week, students slept
on the ﬂoors of church buildings,
dormitories and a community
center. The participants also had
a night where they had limited
funds to purchase food for their
“family” (a group with an average
of six people).

“The activities speciﬁcally
helped us experience on a small
scale what it is like to live in pov-
erty,” participant Dinah Danforth
said. “I not only learned from
these experiences how terrible
poverty is but also how diﬂicult
rising above it is.”

Professors visited during trips
to give students insight on the

ing one house will make a differ-
ence for an individual family, but
it will not solve the problems of
homelessness and substandard
housing.”

Grappling with former views
of poverty, freshmen watched
ﬁlms, participated in activities
and engaged in deep discussions,
often sharing very conﬂicting
viewpoints.

“My dinner group had an
amazing talk about it,” participant
Victoria Raabe said. “It was un-
believable. That was my favorite
discussion.”

During the week, students vol-
unteered for Habitat for Human-
ity, HeadStart, Soup Kitchens, the
Salvation Army, Campus Kitchen
Project and many more organiza-
tions depending on their trip.

“Being able to see frames to
an entire room that four girls put
up by themselves was amazing,”
participant Kelsey Wright said.

Many students said they now
know how to get involved in vol-
unteer activities around campus.

“I’m considering doing Cam-
pus Kitchen because it was such a
great experience,” Wright said. “I
can see myself going down with
a group of friends on Tuesday
nights and making food.”

Dick said one of the most im-
portant qualities of the trip is that
it establishes deep friendships that

XC off to running start

Freshmen perform Saturday for both men and women in season opener

By Jessica Shaw
SPORTS EDITOR

Freshmen standouts on both
the men and women’s cross-
country teams led the Generals
to matching wins at the Washing-
ton & Lee Invitational Saturday
morning.

On the women’s side, sopho-
more Becca Taylor stunned the
crowds as she ﬁnished ﬁrst by
four seconds (20:54.00), outrun-
ning Roanoke opponent Mallory
McClaine (2025800).

‘‘I saw two [Roanoke girls] up
in front of me, and I decided to go
for it,” Taylor said. “After it was
over, I couldn’t believe it.”

Taylor was followed by a trio
of freshmen with Mary Frances
Weatherly in fourth (21:1l.00),
Dorothy Todd in sixth (21:20.00)
and Annie Casper in tenth
(22:10.00). Senior captain Jenny
Ratzel clocked in at 22: 16.00 ﬁn-
ishing twelfth for the Generals.

For the men, junior Andrew
Friski was the Generals’ top com-
petitor ﬁnishing seventh with a
time of 30:14.00. Three fresh-
men ﬁnished on his heels posting
times within ﬁve seconds of each
other. Freshmen Benjamin Stutts,

crossed the ﬁnish in eighth, ninth
and tenth place respectively eam-
ing times of 30:16.00, 30:17.00
and 30:21.00.

“We are incredibly pleased
with the performances of the
freshmen,” captain David Kro-
nenfeld said. “Going from the
5K in high school to the 8K in

college can be a diﬂicult transi-
tion. We are very pleased to see
them handle the transition so
well.”

Last year, both teams placed
fourth at Regionals, and accord-
ing to ODAC Runner and Rookie
of the Year sophomore Jackie
Burns, the team has even higher

expectations for this season.

“We’re closing the gap,” she
said. “There’s a much smaller gap
than there used to be between the
ﬁrst and last runner. I think we
have a shot at Nationals, which
would be great. It’s really excit-
ing to see what the freshmen can
do.”

Coach’s memory lives

Community remembers Amy Reistrup, husband replaces her as coach

By Lara Jordan
STAFF WRITER

After a brief battle with can-
cer, riding coach Amy Reistrup
passed away July 7, leaving a
2006 ODAC Coach of the Year
title and a team she led to win the
2005-06 ODAC Championship.

“Amy was a great person and.

just a lot of fun to be around,” said
senior Katherine Tompkins. “She
had a light-hearted approach to
everything, but was still competi-
tive, which is sometimes a hard
balance to have. There honestly
wasn’t anyone on the team who
didn’t absolutely love her, and I
think that’s a pretty rare thing.”
Teammates said Reistrup
coached with a no-pressure tech-
nique, always encouraging riders.
“Amy coached as she lived
her life,” said junior Alice Shih.
“She told us not to sweat the little
things and to enjoy what was in
front of us. At shows, she always
told me to just breathe and enjoy
the experience. She was also very
demanding in that she knew we
were capable of more than we

ourselves knew.”

As the team recovers from the
loss, Reistrup’s husband, Gordon
Reistrup, will take over her posi-
tion.

“Gordon has extensive experi-
ence in intercollegiate riding, and
already is familiar with many of
us on the team,” said senior Brit-
tany Bansak. “We are honored
that Gordon has chosen to coach
us this year and look forward to
riding with him.”

The riders feel that it will be
easier to adjust to the loss with
Gordon Reistrup as the new
coach.

“[Gordon] and Amy ran their
farm together, coaching and rid-
ing, so they’ll have the same
coaching philosophies and ideas
about what it takes to succeed,”
said Tompkins. “This will make

the change much easier to handle,
and [it] takes away a lot of anxi-
ety about what the new coach will
be like and what he will want to
see.”
Overall, the team has an opti-
mistic attitude for this season.
“This year will be a bit of a
rebuilding year, because we lost
our top two riders, who gradu-
ated, and we also had a couple of
people transfer,” Tompkins said.

“I think we should be pretty com-
petitive, and I just can’t wait to
see what new riders this year will
bring.”

The team is hopeful they will
remain successful, as they carry
on the lessons of Amy Reistrup.

Shih said, “We will all miss
her terribly, but what she has
taught us is still very much with
us in our riding as well as in our
personal lives.”

Football

The Generals lost their ﬁrst
game of the season 21-7

to Franklin & Marshall a
University on Saturday in
Lancaster, Pa. The Generals
got outplayed with F&M in
control of the ball over two
thirds of the playing time.
Senior quarterback Hunter
Dawkins posted 11 for 20
receptions and threw for
one touchdown. Scoring

for the Generals was senior I
wide receiver D.J. Hackett.
After their rough start, the
Generals look to redeem
themselves Saturday against
Sewanee at 1 p.m. at Wilson
Field.

Tennis

The men’s tennis team
opened its season this week-
end by hosting the Generals
Fall Classic. Athletes from
Davidson College, George
Mason University and James
Madison University battled
the Generals. Washington

& Lee did not secure wins
in any of the singles’ or
doubles’ ﬂights but did post
some key performances.
Junior Tim Ross and sopho-
more Jamie McCardell
earned runner-up honors in
singles’ ﬂights while junior
Stuart Sanford and freshman
Clifford Gaddy along with
teammates freshmen Brent
Meyers and junior Seth Fei-
belman secured third place
wins in doubles’ ﬂights.

Soccer

Men’s soccer began a ﬂaw-

Generals ended their season 10-0.
Their overall record sat at 32-5 in-
cluding teams outside the ODAC
bracket. After this weekend, they
begin the season strong at 4-0.

At the awards ceremony, soph-
omores Jess Ulrich and Kassie
Bagley and junior Jess Hudock
earned All-Toumament Team
Honors. Senior captain Lauren
Edmonson was named Most Valu-
able Player of the tournament.

According to Ulrich, the
toughest competition was found
in Averett University. The Gener-
als out-played the Cougars at the
Averett Tournament last fall 3-0.

“We really stepped up against
Averett,” junior Lauren Rudolf
said. “We’re so deep in so many
positions that we’re able to change
the line-up and bring a new level
of intensity to each game. We had
a lot better ball control, and we
passed better, so we had better
offense so we could put the ball
down when we needed to.”

Friday night, the two teams
battled to a ﬁnal score of 30-20,
30-23, 30-18. Though the Gener-
als looked strong throughout, all
three games were hard to gauge,
because the points remained about
even until the ﬁnal stretch.

“We clearly got outplayed
by W&L,” Averett coach Danny
Miller said. “I was really im-
pressed by the way we played
against UVa-Wise. Not to take
anything away from W&L, but
we could play better. We didn’t
have the same enthusiasm. We
have to get our intensity up.”

The rest of the matches ended
relatively quickly as the ladies si-
lenced SVU 30-19, 30-21, 30-15,
McDaniel 30-23, 30-24, 30-17
and UVa-Wise 30-21, 30-15, 30-
9.

All three teams had games
under their belt before the tour-
nament while W&L was starting
with fresh legs. '

“We deﬁnitely went in there
and jumped on the other teams,”
Bagley said. “It’s really hard
coming into a tournament when
the other teams have already had
a week of season and start off re-
ally well.”

The Generals have a young
team this season with eight fresh-
men and ﬁve sophomores. They
return only two juniors and two
seniors.

“We lost a lot of good seniors,
so we really had to adjust our of-
fense,” Ulrich said.

According to Bagley, the Gen-
erals hope to perform better at the
NCAA tournament this year. Last
year, they lost in the ﬁrst round to
Southwestern University 3-0.

“I feel like we are going to
have a really strongjteam,” she
said. “We are deﬁnitely going
to put up a ﬁght against other
teams.”
