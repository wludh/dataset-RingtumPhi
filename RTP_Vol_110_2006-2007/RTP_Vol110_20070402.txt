STICKING

IT TO THE MAN EVERY MONDAY SINCE 1897

VOLUME cx, NuMsEn;4'/7

Sig Ep avoids ﬁraticide by joining up with local Kiwanis Club

By Edward Frattlngton IV
STAFF WRITER

The Student Affairs Com-
mittee voted last night to per-
ma.nently disband all of Wash-
ington and Lee ’s fraternities.

The SAC’s decision came
after a marathon six-hour
meeting that included testimo-
ny from members of each of
the 14 fraternities currently ac-
tive on campus. Though each
frat spoke with the committee,
members of the Phi Gamma
Delta delegation provided the
most detailed explanations.
Delegates from Phi Kappa
Sigma and Phi Delta Theta
refused to comment, while

Sigma Alpha Epsilon threat-
ened to have its high-powered
alumni donate enough money
to purchase the entire SAC.

Sigma Phi Epsilon argued
that it should be exempt be-
cause it only returned to cam-
pus last year, but the chapters
pleas fell on deaf and uncaring
ears.

A last minute compromise,
however, turned the SPE house
into Kiwanis local 92.

The charge was led by the
faculty members on the SAC.
They complained about the
noise and garbage created by
fraternity parties. They also
said fraternities encouraged
revelry and distracted W&L

students from the serious busi-
ness of studying.

One of the faculty mem-
bers complained that the male
Greek system made “freshman
students fall asleep in class
during winter term.”

The dismissal followed a
wave of hazing investigations
that kept the IF C and Director
of Public Safety Mike Young
busy for weeks. Though the
investigations could only turn
up hard evidence against FIJI,
Kappa Sigma and SAE, the
other frats were dismissed
from campus “as a precau-
tion.”

“We know for a fact that
those Phi Delts and Phi Kaps

are not being very nice to their
poor little freshman,” one
SAC member said. “We could
have done a full investigation
on each of the 14 houses, but
it just seemed so much easier
to dismiss each frat at the same
time.”

Dean of Students Dawn
Watkins voted for dismissal
but also told the ex-frat boys
that she was sure everything
would work out just ﬁne. She
offered each fraternity a box
of free Girl Scout cookies as a
parting gift.

As members of each fra-
ternity packed up their frat
rooms and headed for Gaines
Hall, one morose Kappa Alpha

sophomore was seen sitting
with his head in his hands.

“I just don't see how was
can have Old South in a Gaines
suite," he muttered sadly.

By order from the SAC, all
frat houses had to be vacated
by the end of the day.

Chi Psi brothers were all
too hungover from the prior
nights 54th straight Late Nite
to object that they actually
own their house instead of the
school. Multiple northface
jackets, cell phones, and lone
shoes were left in the empty
basement.

The school is already
searching for ways to ﬁll the
suddenly empty buildings.

Director of Student Activities
and Greek Life Jason Rodock-
er said the school was seri-
ously considering inviting 14
new sororities to colonize on
campus.

Rodocker said Delta Zeta
sorority was being heavily re-
cruited because their DePauw
University chapter had shown
a real talent for judging wom-
en on shallow characteristics
like looks and skin color. The
DePauw group earned national
notoriety in February when
their national headquarters
forcibly dismissed more than
half of the chapters members

Leadership School. An alumnus
of W&L, Ruscio served as Dean

sen last month to replace Tom
Williams as the W&L provost.
Rodney A. Smolla, Dean of Law

In a shocking move last night,
President Ken Ruscio announced
that a $1 billion donation by
alumni Gerry Lenfest would al-
low Washington and Lee to pur-
chase the University of Richmond
and turn it into a satellite campus.
The campus will be called Wash-
ington and Lee at Richmond or
W&L-R.

Ruscio admitted that the take-
over plans began in 2001, when
he left his position in the W&L
oolitics department to become

of Freshman before moving into
the politics department. He was
also instrumental in the founding
of the interdisciplinary Environ-
mental Studies program. Act-
ing under guidance from Rector
Phillip Norwood and the board
of trustees, Ruscio carefully inﬁl-
trated the Richmond campus and
recruited several important fac-
ulty members to his cause.
Among the faculty recruited
by Ruscio was June Aprille, the
Richmond provost who was cho-

at the University of Richmond
and the incoming law dean at
W&L, also joined Ruscio’s ca-
bal.

Students at the former Univer-
sity of Richmond said they were
thrilled to now attend a more
prestigious and historical univer-
sity.

“Nobody around this state
cared about U of R,” one student
complained, “but now I’m going
to have a degree from W&L-R
that will deﬁnitely get me a sweet

job because of alumni connec-
tions.”

The student asked that his
name not be used because he was
afraid nobody would hire him if
they knew his real name.

The plan kicked into high gear

in the spring of 2005, when for- _

mer W&L president Torn Burish
left the university and became
the provost at Notre Dame. Al-
though Burish’s departure was
supposedly voluntary, students
pressured him into departing be-
cause he kept trying to close the
doors to Traveller’s stall.

“We iust couldn’t stand Bur-

ish,” one student who requested
anonymity said. “That’s why we
asked the ghosts of Lee and Trav-

eller to drive him out.”

During the year spent by Har-
lan Beckley as W&L’s acting-
president, Ruscio made his ﬁnal
preparations at Richmond and
got ready for his move to Lex-

nounced that he would be return-

A new age of arrogance  

   

Class of 2011 is smarter, cooler, and better than you (or at least they think so)

By Angry Current Students
STAFF WRITERS

Freshman move-in day may
still be ﬁve months away, but the
incoming class of 2011 is wast-
ing no time leaving its mark on
Washington and Lee.

After months of clogging up
the precious brick sidewalks
during ofﬁcial tours, the group
kicked into high gear last month

The precocious youngsters
have also been active on Face-
book, happily spewing out the
misinformation they learned
during their 48-hour visits to
campus. Each male student has
also been providing detailed
analysis of the fraternity and
party scene on campus.

Atlanta resident David Wal-
ton made history this week when
he became the ﬁrst freshman to
be balled from every fraternity
house before he even set foot
on campus (He also became the
ﬁrst student to ever be discussed
in the student press before arriv-
ing on campus).

Walton has been a frequent ,

contributor to the group and was
pleased to let everyone know
that he is a George Washington
scholar. Several current and fu-
ture students quickly told him
that they could not care less.

Walton is the incoming class’s
resident expert on the W&L so-
cial scene and offered several
wildly inaccurate—albeit hi-
larious~anecdotes about party-
ing on campus. He appears to
have discovered that students on
campus occasionally consume
beer and liquor—sometimes
even to excess—while spending
their evenings crowded around
a palette ﬁre or stuffed into a
fraternity basement.

Walton also won 1,700 en-
emies when he proudly told

dently ﬁled a report on the so-
cial scene at the ﬁnals, telling
the world about the exciting Chi
Psi party at Fallout——his infor-
mational sources on campus
still have not shown much im-
provement.

When reminded that Fallout
is actually a Phi Psi house, Wal-
ton refused to comment.

Ralph Stenson from Win-
ston-Salem has also established
himself as another standout in
the 2011 entrants. Stenson said
on the class’s F acebook site that
he wouldn’t wait for the excit-
ing fall term. .

“Fall term is supposed to be
siiicckkkk [sic],” Stenson said.

“It’s like tryouts for frat lords.
But I heard you can get balled
for stupid things. However, free
beer and drugs are worth the
risk.”

Stenson was quickly in-
formed that e-mails like the one
he had just sent fell under the
category of “stupid things.”

Stenson, like several other
future Generals, is hoping to
play a sport at W&L. He is
preparing to be a sick laxer and
also hopes to play on the soccer
team. He also said that he did
not want to observe the athletic
department’s policy of staying
sober the night before games
because he is good enough to
score three goals while battling
a monster hangover.

Lucas Stratton, a lacrosse

hopeful from San Francisco,
has been wowing future class-
mates with thrilling stories from
his earlier visits. He claims to
have ridden from one party to
the next at 4 a.m. on the top of
someone’s Jeep Wrangler, prov-
ing that he is both a liar and
also extremely stupid. What on
Earth was the admissions office
smoking the day they decided to
let this dummy come to W&L?
History professor H.P. Por-
ter, a W&L alumnus and long-
time member of the faculty, was
thrilled to hear that the incom-
ing class was once again the
best class in university history.
Porter has been saying for years
that the school keeps adding
the brightest class ever, mean-
ing that students probably get

dumber during their tenure in
Lexington.

Though the new students will
arrive with shining reputations,
Porter is prepared to break their
will during his 100 level intro-
duction to European civiliza-
tion. The grades of H, S and
even Z- often send freshman
students crying to their parents.
Porter’s upper—level students
often take time off from their
study of South Africa, Canada
or other mundane Common-
wealth states to comfort the dis-
traught freshmen.

Walton and other students
spent several weeks bragging
about their AP scores and the
upcoming AP tests, but it ap-
pears none of them will attempt
to graduate without ever setting

foot in Lexington. Some, how-
ever, hope to ﬁnish up during
their ﬁrst semester in order to
avoid pledgeship.

Summer Lollie, who lives
in the Dallas suburbs, also at-
tracted attention when she used

tence in several of her Facebook .

e-mails. Unfortimately, nobody
had the heart to tell her that only
12-year-olds still use that sort of
slang in e-mails.

The ﬁnal word on the illustri-
ous Class of 2011 was provided
by Malcolm Hines, a current
W&L freshman from Rich-
mond.

“Congrats to all you kid-
dies,” Hines said. “But trust

The ongoing proposal to move
the Museum of the Confederacy
from Richmond to Lexington is
still facing intense criticism from
members of the Lexington area.

In the midst of the criticism,
there is also some doubt about
whether the museum’s move will
have the effects on tourism many
claim is a selling point for bring-
ing the museum to Lexington.

Waite Rawls, the museum’s
Executive Director, said the mu-
seum is considering relocation to
Lexington in hopes of increased
visitation for the institution.
Rawls said that the location of
both VMI and Washington and
Lee in Lexington is “obviously
synergistic” to the Museum.

Chief among Rawls’s claims
is that the museum, VMI and

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty graduate H.F. “Gerry” Lenfest
announced that he will donate
$33 million to his alma mater to
increase faculty compensation.
The gift is the largest in the uni-
versity’s history.

Lenfest, a 1953 graduate and
former member of W&L’s board
of trustees, is grateful for the op-
portunity to give to an organiza-
tion that taught him more than
just academics.

“Like most people who gradu-
ate from W&L, the experience
and what you learn there follows
you throughout life,” said Len-
fest. “l’ve had the chance to give
back.”

Lenfest’s donation will be
used solely to increase salaries

ery as the cause of the war; in spite of historic

evidence to the contrary. I ﬁnd that argument

lar scholarly interests, and visi-
tors to Lexington, because of the
schools’ collections of Jackson
and Lee artifacts will be attracted
to a relocated museum.

This claim that the museum
and the colleges share scholarly
interests has been sharply contest-
ed by Dr. Ted DeLaney of W&L’s
history department.

“The irony is that Rawls gives
lip service to modern scholarship
over the origins of the Civil War,”
said DeLaney.

DeLaney said that the museum
is, in his experience, an institution

and beneﬁts for existing faculty.
W&L Provost Tom Williams be-
lieves that his donation will keep
the university on par with the pay
scale of other top institutions.

“I think it will have an imme-
diate effect for someone looking
at W&L versus another school
that pays more,” said Williams.
“They might want to be here, but
have to consider whether they can
afford the pay cut. We’re below
the mean in salaries and we want
to get there.”

Dean of the Williams School
Larry Peppers adds that W&L’s
small town location makes com-
pensation an even more important
subject.

“One issue we run into here is
opportunities for a spouse or part-
ner,” said Peppers. “There just
aren’t the same types of jobs that
you’d ﬁnd in DC.”

that draws proponents of Lost
Cause mythology in its presenta-
tion of the Civil War. “The old
Lost Cause argument. . .denies
slavery as the cause of the war,
in spite of historic evidence to the
contrary,” said DeLaney in a writ-
ten statement. “I ﬁnd that argu-
ment both wrong and offensive.”

DeLaney discussed an educa-
tional program he participated in
2006 as a panelist. The program
was sponsored by the University
of Richmond’s history depart-
ment and the museum.

DeLaney said the program

was “like living through a night-
mare.” He said the entirely white
audience that was present was
“representative of the negative
baggage that comes with the Mu-
seum of the Confederacy,” saying
all of them were “Lost Cause die-
hards.”

DeLaney also pointed out that
the Museum has claimed the en-
dorsement of scholars such as
himself and incoming-Harvard
President Drew Gilpin Faust. But
he disputes the idea that every
scholar to research at the museum
actually endorses it.

In his written statement, DeL-
aney said, “My own fear is that
the already tiny black profes-
sional community [in Lexington]
will vanish if the museum moves
to Lexington. The town will sim-
ply become whiter than it is now,
and the museum will be at home
in a community where there are
no strong black critics.”

It does seem to be the case that
the city of Lexington is interested

in the potential relocation of the
museum.

Sammy Moore, Executive
Director of the Lexington-Rock-
bridge Chamber of Commerce,
said that the president of the
Chamber’s board had written let-
ters to the museum as part of an
investigation into potential eco-
nomic beneﬁts for Lexington and
Rockbridge area businesses.

“If it proves to be an economic
beneﬁt then the chamber will pay
attention to it,” said Moore.

Jean Clark, the Executive Di-
rector of the Lexington-Rock-
bridge Area Tourism Bureau es-
timated visitors to the museum
could contribute as much as $600
per person to the local economy.

Rawls estimated that the Vir-
ginia Horse Center and Natural
Bridge combined bring in some
650,000 visitors a year to the
Lexington area. With a planned
2011 opening to coincide with the
150'“ anniversary of the start of
the Civil War, Rawls claims that

the museum could “get a lot more
visitors.”

Critics are skeptical the muse-
um will be a tourism boon though.
DeLaney points out that “nothing
important to the Civil War hap-
pened here” and that the location
of Jackson and Lee’s burial sites
in Lexington are the only real
connections Lexington has to the
Civil War.

DeLaney said the lack of an
easily accessible airport nearby
and the price of gas will likely
be large deterrents for Civil War
buffs, even if the museum relo-
cated to Lexington.

“There are two corpses here,”
said DeLaney.

In DeLaney’s opinion, the
museum’s move will have far less
economic impact than projected
and will potentially drive off the
black professional community in
Lexington.

“Richmond is a large city and
a Civil War site,” said DeLaney.

“The museum belongs there.”

  _ Lenfest discusses landmark gift

Advancement head Dennis Cross

says matching fundraising must be completed by December 2010

In addition to attracting fac-
ulty, Lenfest believes that the do-
nation will compensate the hard
work of current professors.

“Washington and Lee has re-
ally become one of the preemi-
nent liberal arts university’s in the
country, and we attribute that to
its faculty,” said Lenfest. “Teach-
ers have to get compensation that
matches their teaching excel-
lence.”

The gift must be matched by
December 31, 2010, for a ﬁnal
total of $66 million. Vice Presi-
dent for University Advancement
Dennis Cross said that the univer-
sity has already made strides in its
effort to raise money from alums,
parents, and friends.

“We’ll be talking to those
people, asking them to make gifts
to support the challenge grant,
which we’re calling the Lenfest

Faculty Support Challenge En-
dowment,” said Cross. “A current
board member called last month
and said that he wanted to donate
$500,000 to the fund.”

The issue of faculty compen-
sation came up in a conversation
between Williams and Lenfest
during a breakfast meeting of the
Presidential Search Committee.
Cross, who is in charge of raising
private gifts for W&L, praised
Lenfest’s willingness to give to a

variety of causes.

“Mr. Lenfest is a sophisticated
donor with very wide interests,”
said Cross. “He is a true philan-
thropist.”

Lenfest has also contributed
to the construction of W&L’s per-
forming arts building, now called
Lenfest Center, as well as to Wil-
son Hall, the university’s art and
music building.

Since selling his cable televi-
sion company, Lenfest Commu-

nications, to COMCAST Corpo-
ration in January of 2001, he has
given to a number of other orga-
nizations including Mercersburg
Academy, Columbia Law School,
the Philadelphia Museum of Art,
the Curtis Institute of Music,
and many more. He also ﬁmded
a millennium village in Kenya,
a “bottom up” approach to help
developing countries get out of
poverty.

The new salaries will take ef-
fect during the 2008-2009 aca-
demic year, but increasing salaries
is not the only priority on W&L’s
agenda.

“Of course this is certainly not
the only thing we’ll be raising
money for at the same time,” said
Cross. “Faculty support is part
of the strategic plan that we’ll be
hearing more about as we go for-
ward.”

A new look at 21? New book

Former Middleibury president shares idea of a drinking license

By Sacha Raab
STAFF WRITER

Former President of Mid-
dlebury College and founder
of Choose Responsibility, Dr.
John M. McCardell, spoke to
the Washington and Lee corn-
munity on Tuesday, March 27”‘
about the beneﬁts of lowering
the drinking age from 21 to 18.

“Drinking age 21 is bad so-
cial policy and terrible law,”
said McCardell. “Parents and
institutions are marginalized
and underage drinking is worse
than it’s ever been.”

McCardell believes that the
legal drinking age of 21 denies
the fact that alcohol is a cul-
tural reality and that prohibition
doesn’t work. Prohibition, he
believes, merely results in eva-
sion of the law and the creation
of ethical dilemmas, meaning
drinking becoming more pro-
nounced and less visible.

Furthermore, McCardell
said, “The law puts before an
institution a set of impossible
choices: you either look the
other way and permit the law to
be violated, but ultimately corn-
municate that the law is unjust
and unfair and you can choose
which laws you follow, or you
take the stance that the law is
the law and you must crack

-_ down and enforce the law more

“In all instances but one~the purchase, posses-

sion, and consumption of alcohol—I 8 year-olds

are considered adults in the United States. ”

JOHN MCCARDELL President emeritus of Mlddiebury College
 

vigorously.”

He said, however, that the
problem with more strictly en-
forcing the law is that it simply
“uproots and transplants the
problem to unregulated and un-
safe environments.”

According to McCardell,
lowering the drinking age will
make the situation more imper-
feet, yet it will bring the issue
out into the open and allow al-
cohol to be part of normal social
intercourse in the adult world.

He said, “In all instances
but one — the purchase, posses-
sion, and consumption of alco-
hol — l8—year—olds are consid-
ered adults in the United States.
Once we cease to infantilize
young adults in this respect, they
will no longer live down to our
expectations and will develop a
more mature view of alcohol.”

Additionally, alcohol is af-
fecting family relations in our
country. McCardell stated, “Le-
gal age [of] 21 is anti-family. It
displaces parents from the exer-

cise of one of the most impor-
tant parental duties of educating
their young adults in responsible
alcoholic consumption.”
During his time at Middle-
bury, McCardell witnessed the
social atmosphere when the
drinking age was 18 as opposed
to 21. He said, “The social
scene has changed dramatically.
With a legal age [of] 18, there
was more intergenerational so-
cializing in a more mature set-
ting. Adults didn’t feel like they
had to catch college students
breaking the law, and you hard-
ly heard of binge drinking.”
McCardell further supports
his argument with statistics the
alcohol related fatalities do not
directly correlate with the legal
age of 21 and that underage and
binge drinking are worse now
than they’ve ever been.
Students at W&L have been
drinking less in recent years, but
the school still annually exceeds
the national averages for binge
drinking and blackout drinking.

The school has had success,
however, in sharply reducing
the number of DU1s by students
on both the law and undergradu-
ate campuses.

However. the medical ﬁeld
continues to consider the dan-
ger of shifting the legal drink-
ing age back. The head doctor
of the W&L health center, Dr.
Jane Horton. said, “Lowering
the drinking age is worth con-
sidering, but there is valid sci-
ence that the later we can defer
exposure to alcohol, the fewer
individuals might have impaired
learning and addiction.”

She, too, strongly identiﬁes
with the ethical dilemma that
McCardell described, yet she
believes, “as an institution, we
cant be held hostage by and re-
sponsible for students making
high risk choices and breaking
the law. Our job should be to
educate.”

In response to a question con-
cerning her opinion of alcohol
on this campus, Dr. Horton re-
plied, “There is a lot of high risk
use of alcohol on this campus.
Every week 1 see students who
suffer the negative etfects of
overuse of alcohol. 1 know the
tell it takes on people’s physical
and personal health.”

Earlier this year W&L’s of-
ﬁce of Health Promotion invited
Chris and Toren Volkmann to
campus to speak about Toren°s
struggle with alcoholism.

McCardell”s program,
Choose Responsibility, proposes
to lower the legal drinking age
from 21 to 18 and accompany
the change in law with “a corn-
prehensivc program for young
adults that requires education
and licensing. offers personal
incentives for adherence. and
enforces responsible and ethical
adult behavior among all those
— regardless of age  who make
choices about drinking."

He recognizes that any
change in the law is far in the
future yet currently aims to start
a public discussion that is “in-
formed and dispassionate” to
consider whether the current
situation can be improved.

McCardell said, “I’ve felt
strongly about this for a very
long time. I believe this is an
issue to which students can re-
sponsibly devote their energy.”

Ba nerisms

Doris Bane hopes students will
share photos and stories for book

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

For nearly 20 years Thom-
as “Baner” Bane has been the
first person new W&L stu-
dents and their parents see
when they arrive for fresh-
man move—in day. Standing
in the middle of Washington
Street just short of the domrs,
Baner smoothly routes traffic
through the organized chaos,
helping befuddled freshmen
ﬁnd their way to the proper
dorms.

Baner is famous for more
than just his trafﬁc skills. He
has also jumped hundreds of
cars for students who have
left their lights on or are suf-
fering from mechanical trou-
bles. On a less popular note,
there are also the hundreds of
parking tickets he has writ-
ten and vehicles he has had
towed.

Now, after her husband’s
34 years with —W&L, Doris
Bane has decided write a
book about her husband. She
thinks that Baner stands as a
true example of the family at-
mosphere W&L prides itself
on. Thafs why Baner and his
W&L family will be the fo-
cus of the book.

“I’ve had a tremendous
response from alumni about
Baner. especially from his
time working in the gym’s
equipment room during the
tenure of Coach Fallon.”

Fallon was a legendary
W&L football coach who led
the team from 1978 until his
death in 1995. He has more
wins than any coach in W&L
history.

Alumni response has var-
ied from 5-page, hand-writ-
ten letters to a short para-
graph in an e-mail, but each
person seems to have a dif-

ferent story to share about her
husband.
Mrs. Bane has been

spending parts of the last
several weeks on campus,
meeting with students, fac-
ulty, staff and even President
Ruscio to gather their favor-
ite memories of Barter. She
is also hoping students will
send her photographs of Ba-
ner working at parties at the
Pole Houses, Windfall Hill or
Pink Palace.

Though she has received
some responses from current
students, Mrs. Bane hopes to
gather more of their stories
before spring break. She is
working with such a tight
schedule because of upcorn-
ing deadlines from the book‘s
publisher.

The book will mix recol-
lections from students, fac-
ulty and alumni with some
of Baner’s favorite stories
and his famous “Banerisms."
Part of the struggle has been
getting Barter himself to sit
down for interviews that will
go in the book. Between
working full-time with the
school, serving as a security
officer at parties and events,
and managing three farms
that he owns, Baner has more
than enough to keep him
busy.

The book is currently
scheduled for release this
fall, hopefully just before
W&L’s Parents’ Weekend.
Mrs. Bane hopes to hold a re-
lease event and book signing
that we ekend.

She can be reached at ba-
nerandi@.yahoo.corn. Photos
can be sent to 169 Bunker
Hill Mill Road in Lexington.

In the meantime, Baner
will continue writing tickets
and sharing his wisdom with
the W&L family.

Tolerance
is truly fear

Ruscios email encourages fear of
disagreement, disapproval instead
of demanding acceptance of others

I write in response to President
Ruscio’s recent message to the
W&L community. in which he en-
courages ‘a dialogue that speaks
to our fundamental commitments
to civility and tolerance’. Unless
we take civility to mean nothing
more than ‘being nice’, these two
fundamental commitments of
ours are in basic opposition. Ci-
vility implies civilisation, culture
and reﬁnement; tolerance makes
no distinction between what is
civilised and what is barbaric, be-
tween the reﬁned and the crude.

Our alleged commitment to
tolerance demands our respect,
acceptance and appreciation of
diverse ways of thinking and
living—even of those we might
consider destructive and contrary
to civility. Now, toleration of a
thing implies disapproval of it.
If my friend asserts an idea with
which I agree, I do not tolerate
it~I accept it, for I’m on his side.
But, if he says something I do not
like, I can either challenge it and
give my opinion or tolerate it and
keep quiet.

The latter option is intellec-
tual cowardice. It is a refusal to

afﬁrrn what one believes is right
and true, preferring to hide behind
a false neutrality to avoid having
to confront alternate points of
view. How fear of intellectual
disagreement and of intelligent
engagement can be considered
a fundamental commitment of a
university community is quite be-
yond me.

The latter is in-
tellectual cow-
ardice. It is a
refusal to aﬁirm
what one be-
lieves is right.

As a ﬁnal point, I, together
with President Ruscio, ‘abhor
acts of violence and aggression
toward others no matter the mo-
tivation’. Indeed, I am intolerant
of them.

A clean ‘O8 campaign

Presidential candidates might run out of mud to sling if this keeps up

By Abel Delgado
c o LU M u I sr

The 2008 General Election
Campaign for president might
turn out to be out to be one of the
cleanest and most ﬂawless gener-
al campaigns in recent memory.

After all the dirt the candidates
have thrown to others in their own
party and all the blunders they
have made to derail their own
campaign, there might not be any
mud left to sling or ways left to
mess up by the time the Demo-
crats and Republicans picks their
candidates.

To begin with, there’s the
campaign’s supposed golden boy,
Barrack Obama.

Normally, not having any con-
crete stands or experience would
not hinder a candidate this early.
But the other candidates have
began to pummel Obama on his
lack of experience. Do not think
the senator is going to take it ly-
ing down, though.

There_is already a shady link
between a campaign worker of
his and the man who created an
intemet attack ad comparing Hill-

How can a one-time cross-dresser be
leading the Republican polls? Well,
with this crowd, anything is possible.

ary Clinton, the only candidate
ahead of Obama in the Democrat-
ic polls, to an 1984ish Big Broth-
er type of leader. The commercial
is downright creative and might
hold some truth, so Obama loses
points for not taking credit.

Then there’s Republican Mitt
Romney who has taken a page
from the Democratic strategy
book and ﬂip-ﬂopped on every is-
sues from abortion to gay rights
to immigration.

Obviously trying to mimic the
vast success that John Kerry had
with the same strategy, Romney
has changed his stance depend-
ing on the crowd in front of him,
pandered to the “party base” and
attacked those, i.e. John McCain,
who have not done the same.

McCain is obviously letting
Rorrmey get to him since he now

says he’s reconsidering his once
staunch stance on immigration.

The former front-runner has
had to be on the defensive as of
late, being the most prominent
candidate to show support for the
new Bush plan in Iraq.

Back on the Democratic side,
there is John Edwards. While ev-
eryone has gained a new level of
respect for Edwards and his fam-
ily for continuing his campaign as
his wife bravely ﬁghts cancer, has
anyone else noticed the man has
become a socialist?

Edwards has plans for the
U.S., not the least of which in-
cludes universal health care and
more welfare that would leave the
country looking more European
than many Americans are ready
for.

Of course he’s not the only one

promising universal health care.

Senator Clinton, everyone’s
favorite candidate to hate, has
copied Edwards’ plan to thetee. It
might work better than her eight
year failure of health care reform
did as ﬁrst lady.

This might not be enough to.

convince the 44 percent of Amer-
icans that already have decided
not vote for her. If Clinton has
succeeded in anything, it’s unit-
ing mainstream America against
her.

She really has no reason to
campaign considering evcryone’s
opinion ofher, whether positive or
negative, is already set in stone.

That leaves the current front
runner, Rudy Giuliani.

How can a one-time cross
dresser be leading the Republican
polls? How can a man the liberals
of New York consider dictatorial
lead the national polls? Well with
this crowd, anything is possible.

Hopefully some positive in-
formation will come out of one
of these candidates soon. If not,
here’s to 19 more months of the
agonizing reality one of these
people will lead the free world.

Against all odds

Playing the lottery is a tax on stupid
people, winning not a walk in the park

By Jesslca Stelnmetz
c o LU M N I sr

Playing the lottery is just re-
ally stupid. That’s the only thing I
remember from my Pre-Calculus
class.

It has actually nothing to do
with Pre-Calc, which is quite
unfortunate since I am actually
taking Cale 101 right now. And,
yes, I am a junior...smart choice,
I know.

My high school math teacher
spent a whole class period ranting
about the lottery and mathemati-
cally proving the odds that lottery
players are up against.

I am sure Mr. Jungk would be
disappointed that I do not remem-
ber how to come up with these
numbers. I do, however, remem-
ber one thing: the odds are astro-
nomically against lottery players.

For instance, you have a better
chance of being struck by light-
ening or dying by eating ﬂesh-
eating bacteria than winning the
California State Lottery. Those
are clearly excellent odds.

It is three times more likely
for a person driving ten miles to
buy a Lotto ticket to be killed in
an accident than to actually win
the lottery.

Here’s another statistic for
you: if one person purchases 50
Lotto tickets each week, they will

win the jackpot about once every
5,000 years.

As Dave Barry, the humor
columnist says, “The lottery is a
tax on stupid people.” After all,
it seems foolish to waste money
when the odds are so against you.

People who play the lottery of-
ten say something along the lines
of, “It’s only a dollar and I can
win so much”.

But it is not only a dollar. Peo-
ple typically do not just buy one
lottery ticket in their life.

The average American spends
$184 on the lottery. And that is
just the average.

Then there is all the players
who have to make up for people
like me, who will never spend a
single cent on a lottery ticket, or
people who just play it once or
twice a year.

If you invested instead of
spending $10 a month on lottery
tickets over 40 years, the typi-
cal increased retirement savings
rather than playing the lottery
would be around $14,440. And
remember that $10 a month is less
than what the average American
spends.

While that might not seem like
a lot of money to some of you,
think of how much that money
could help a family that was not
well-off.

Or think about how much that

could help your favorite charity.

Of course there are the lucky
ones. I have never known anyone
who actually won the lottery but
it does happen.

Hitting the lottery is not ex-
actly picture-perfect.

Think of how many people
would hit you up for money.
When you just won all that “free”
money, it is hard to say “no” with-
out a ﬁght with at least one friend
or relative. ‘

By the time the government
takes a huge chunk out of money,
you ﬁnally give in to your broke
cousin Nina so she does not think
you are a complete selﬁsh witch
for turning her down.

Then you go on your increased
Christmas shopping spree so the
whole family does not think you
are a cheapskate, and you will be
nowhere near having enough to
quit your job and live the good
life.

But then I ﬁnally got to replace
my laptop that was literally fall-
ing apart when my Grandma won
big-time from the slot machines.
And she only put in a few dollars
before you won.

So if you really have to gam-
ble in some form or another, play
the slots.

The odds are at least better,
and it is more than a quick minute
of entertainment. right?

Hearing needs
press coverage

Active student press will let hearing be truly, open

Wednesday’s open hearing is an unusual
event. An open hearing has not occured in
over a decade.

The student press on campus has been
working this week with the Executive Com-
mittee to plan our coverage of the trial.

We believe that open press coverage is
the best way to truly inform all members
of the community about how the hearing
works and about what the jury eventually
decides.

Members of the Phi, Trident and A
Week in General will be working together
this week to cover the trial. The two news-
papers will publish a joint issue tomorrow
night that contains all the information you
will need to know about Wednesday’s trial.

It is important to remember, however,
that all members of these news organiza-
tions are students as well as journalists.
Journalists on this campus must learn to
abide by this system while at the same time
covering its actions.

We hold the White Book in the highest
respect and are concerned ﬁrst and foremost
about allowing the accused student to have
a fair hearing on his/her case. Therefore, we
will withhold the student’s name during our

coverage.

Many of you may wonder why the trial
needs to be covered. Aﬁer all, it is open to
all current members of the W&L commu-
nity.

But because Lee Chapel only holds
525 members, approximately 25 percent
of our students can attend the trial at any
given time. That calculation does not even
consider faculty and staff who may wish to
watch our honor system at work.

Our press coverage will greatly beneﬁt
people who are unable to attend.

Above all, our goal is to educate the
community on the procedures of the hear-
ing as well as the past history of open hear-
ings. We are not there to serve as court
reporters.

Our campus speaks constantly about the
trust we have in each other, and an open
hearing is the ultimate example of that
trust.

That trust is what is allowing the student
press to work with trial chairman Adam
Hull and EC President Rob Rain.

Through our coverage of this event, we
will uphold the trust placed in us.

Self-interest swells in US

Study indicates that narcissism is becoming a trend among college students across the nation

By Queenle Wong
STAFF WRITER

University President Ken
Ruscio remains optimistic about
the evolution of Washington and
Lee’s campus culture despite a
national study that found a rise in
narcissism and self-centeredness
among today’s college students.

“I look at the students in the
seventies and I see where they are
now, and with great regularity,
they tend to be people that are not
just involved in their business...
they tend to be active and en-
gaged individuals, and I don’t see
any reason to think that the cur-
rent generation will display a dif-
ferent pattern,” said Ruscio, who
graduated from W&L in 1976.

The study, according to the
press release, analyzed the re-
sponses of 16,475 college students
throughout the United States, who
ﬁlled out the Narcissistic Person-
ality Inventory between 1982 and
2006. Lead author of the report,
San Diego State University As-
sociate Professor Jean Twenge,
presented the study along with
her colleagues at the SDSU gen-
eration gap workshop Feb. 27.

The NPI asks students to re-
spond to statements such as: “If
I ruled the world, it would be a
better place,” “I can live my life
anyway I want to” and “I like to
be the center of attention.”

The study found that almost
two-thirds of today’s college stu-
dents had narcissism scores that

“I think that one way that [students] can check

themselves is to really develop a sense of being

okay based on your own standard ”

CHRISTY BARONGAN, unlverslty counsellng psychologist
 

were above the average 1982
score. Thirty percent more col-
lege students showed elevated
narcissism in 2006 than in 1982
and the average college student
scored nearly as high on narcis-
sism as the average celebrity.

According to the press release,
it is the largest study ever con-
ducted on generational changes
in narcissism. The report is still
under review for publication in a
scholarly journal.

Ruscio, who acknowledged the
ﬁndings, said that although W&L
students tend to be very self-as-
sured and conﬁdent in their lead-
ership and intellectual abilities,
he wouldn’t characterize them as
narcissistic. He believes that stu-
dents on this campus would score
lower on the NPI than on other
campuses.

President Ruscio also said that
the university historically attracts
students devoted to community
service and volunteer work.

According to the Cooperative
Institutional Research Program’s
(CIRP) Freshman Survey, W&L
freshmen have shown about a
13 percent increase in volunteer

work since 1985.

The latest survey, taken this
fall, shows that about 90 percent
of freshmen performed volunteer
work occasionally or frequently
in the last year. This time the per-
centage was slightly above the
national average by about ﬁve
percent.

But another alumnus, Profes-
sor and Head of the University’s
Journalism Department Brian
Richardson, does see a change in
W&L’s student culture.

“At W&L, I see more of a
sense of entitlement among stu-
dents,” he said. “It’s not among
all students. I wouldn’t even say
it’s among most students, but it’s
more prevalent than it used to
be.”

Richardson, who graduated
from the university in 1973, said
that he doesn’t believe students
are more self-centered by nature,
but rather that their parents are in-
dulging this behavior more often.
As a result, this leaves the impres-
sion that students don’t have to
take responsibility for their own
actions.

Yet Richardson also thinks

that W&L’s students are more
involved in local community ser-
vice than their predecessors. Back
in the 1970s, due to the war, many
students were involved globally
rather than locally, he said.

Perhaps the major diﬁerence
between W&L’s current and past
generation is the use of technol-
ogy, which Twenge believes fuels
the trend of narcissism. Ruscio
and Richardson agreed.

“It cuts across the grain of our
campus culture,” said Ruscio, who
worries about the “gravitational
pull” away from the university’s
fundamental traditions.

It’s no longer uncommon for
students to walk around cam-
pus with their cell phones. This
makes it difficult to practice the
university’s speaking tradition,
said Richardson.

Despite technology’s negative
effects on the current generation,
University Counseling Psychia-
trist Kirk Luder said that students
usually use websites such as
Facebook and MySpace to make
connections rather than isolate
themselves.

Luder believes that the fact
that most students on campus
come from intact families, who
value educational achievement,
also makes it less likely that
W&L would score high on the
NPI. Compared to other institu-
tions he’s worked for, Luder be-
lieves that narcissism is actually
lower on this campus.

mitting there is some truth in the
ﬁndings, ’doesn’t necessarily ac-
cept this stereotype either.

Senior Anthony Zappin said
that the campus atmosphere has
mostly stayed the same in the last
four years, but that this isn’t re-
ally a “bad thing.” _

“I guess at W&L there’s not
a lot of diversity, but at the same
time the group of people here are
very well-mannered,” he said.

But for those who experience
narcissism and self-centeredness,
there are negative consequences.

University Counseling Psy-
chologist Maria “Christy” Bar-
ongan said that to some degree
students need to feel good about
themselves, however, “unhealthy
narcissism” creates an inﬂated
sense of self, which substitutes
for self-esteem. Narcissists tend
to rely on external factors to feel
good about themselves and are in
constant need of praise, she said.

“I think that one way that
[students] can check themselves
is to really develop a sense of
being okay based on your own
standar ,” said Barongan. “What
other people think about you may
ﬂuctuate, but if you have a sense
of yourself that remains constant,
I think that’s going to be the thing
that prevents people from going
overboard.”

The nationally ranked
men’s tennis team wrapped
up a successful two week
stretch this weekend

by knocking off No. 26
Swarthmore 5-4 yesterday
in Lexington. Jon Malooly,
Seth Feibelman and Stuart
Sanford got wins at third,
fourth, and sixth singles,
respectively, and the No.
17 Generals also got two
doubles wins. Sanford and
F eibehnan grabbed an 8-2
victory at No. 3 doubles
while Tim Ross and Nat
Estes avenged defeats in
singles by defeating their
opponents 8-4 in the top
doubles spot. The men
also grabbed a 9-0 sweep
on Saturday when they
defeated Christopher New-
port in Lexington. The
third match of the weekend
was a 6-3 victory over
Rhodes College on Friday
afternoon. The defeat was
only the second of the year
for Rhodes. W&L swept
doubles play in that match
and added wins at second,
third, and fourth singles
from Estes, Malooly and
Feibelman. W&L suffered
only its second loss of the
season a week ago Satur-
day when they dropped a
5-4 decision against .Mary
Washington, the No. 9 team
in the country. Wins from
Ross and Estes at number
one doubles and from Ross,
Malooly and Feibelman in
singles left the team just
one point short of victory.

Track takes on D-

Men is and women is teams record 10
D-III ﬁrst place ﬁnishes at AS] CS
Invitational over the weekend

By Russ Weoms
STAFF WRITER

Over the past two weeks,
the W&L track team has faced
some stout competition but has
fared well. Both of their last two
meets included NCAA Division I
teams.

Last Saturday the Generals
participated in the Fred Hardy In-
vitational. The meet consisted of
Division I teams and scored indi-
vidually only.

Despite the tough competi-
tion, W&L had some strong per-
fonnances.

On the women's side, sopho-
more Elizabeth Webb ﬁnished
ninth in the 800 meters with a
time of 2:21.03. Sophomore Bec-
ca Taylor took 11"‘ in the 1500
meters with a time of 4:53.83.

Freshman Sallie Armstrong
notched a 20"‘ place ﬁnish 400
meter hurdles with a time of
70.33 while sophomore Stepha-
nie Stelter followed right behind
her with a time of 71.70 to earn
21st place. _

In the men’s meet, junior Steve
Rivoir, sophomores Robbie Vari-
papa and Alex Jackson, and fresh-
man Rob Saliers placed third in a
time of 8: 19.53 in the 4x800 relay.
Sophomore Chip McCoy ﬁnished
23"’ in the 400 meter hurdles with
atime of 61.86.

Freshman Billy Billington
competed at the Bridgewater In-
vitational in Bridgewater, Va. He
ﬁnished second in two events,
with a 45-foot shot put throw and
a heave of 131 feet in the discus.

This Saturday W&L competed
in the Asics Invitational at Liberty
University. The meet included
Division I, Division II, and Divi-
sion III teams.

Against the Division III teams,
W&L fared well, accumulating
10 ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes.

For the men, freshman Ben
Goetsch tied for ﬁrst overall in
the high jump with an impressive
high jump of 6’00.75.” Freshman
Ryan Castle’s 38’l0.25 triple
jump was ﬁrst among Division
III competitors. Sophomore Chip
McCoy took ﬁrst in Division III
in the 400 meter hurdles with a
time of 59.96.

The women had an impressive
showing, with seven competitors
placing ﬁrst in Division III.

Webb took ﬁrst among Divi-
sion III runners in the 1500 me-
ters in a stellar school-record time
of 4:49.00.

Stelter took ﬁrst among D-III
competitors in the 400 meter hur-
dles with a time of 71.42. Fresh-
man Lizz Krausnick ﬁnished ﬁrst
among D-III runners in the 800
meters with a time of 2:24.82.
Taylor put up atime of 18:38.90 in

the 5000 meters which was good
enough for ﬁrst in Division III.
Junior pole vaulter Liz Brandler
placed ﬁrst out of D-III competi-
tors with an 8’ll.75” effort.

One highlight of the weekend
was Armstrong competing in the
heptathlon. '

i The heptathlon is a two-day

event which consists of the 100m
hurdles, high jump, shot put, and
200m run on the ﬁrst day and the
long jump, javelin, and 800m run
on the second day.

Armstrong scored 3,175 points
to establish a new school record.

The Generals next meet is over
the break on Saturday, April 14 at

the Coastal Carolina Invitational
in Conway, S.C at 9 a.m.

The team is looking forward to
doing very well at this meet.

“We think with two weeks to
prepare we can really show what
we can do and set a lot of per-
sonal records at this meet,” said
Saliers.

Womerfs tennis beats J MU

Team defeats nationally ranked Trinity and Pomona—Pitzer in pair of 9-0 matches ’

By Mlchael Keenan
STIFF WRITER

The women’s tennis team ran
its record to 10-0 on the season
after defeating Division I James
Madison University 5-4 on March
21 in Harrisonburg, VA.

“They’re a Division I team,
and we don’t get to play D-I
teams very oﬁen,” said Katie
Tabb. ‘‘If we can compete against
a D-I program, that really says
something about our level at the
D-III level.”

In the doubles portion of the
competition, JMU took two of
three matches to take a 2-1 lead.
The Dukes team of Rebecca Er-
ickson and Briana Jain defeated
Leah Weston and Ginny Wortham
8-5 and Lauren Graham and Kelly
Maxwell defeated W&L’s Lauren
Caire and Kelly Will by the same
score.

The General’s lone victory in
the doubles matches came when
Emily Applegate and Tabb de-
feated JMU’s duo of Anna Khoor
and Mary Napier.

Applegate and Tabb continued
where they left off by winning the
No. 1 and No. 2 singles matches
against Napier and Khoon Apple-
gate won in three sets 6-3, 3-6, 6-
3, while Tabb won in straight sets
6-1, 6-3.

JMU’s Jain and Maxwell both
won in straight sets over Will and
Caire, but victories by Wortham’s
and Weston’s victories secured
the 5-4 win for the Generals.

Before heading off to Texas
for the Fab Five Tournament, the
women recorded a pair of 9-0 vic-
tories against conference oppo-
nents Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College on March 22 and Virginia
Wesleyan on March 24.

The Generals only dropped
one game in the match against
Randy-Mac and did not drop a set

in either match.

The Fab Five tournament got
off to a rainy start and W&L’s ﬁrst
match against Pomona—Pitzer,
which was scheduled for Friday,
was postponed until Saturday.

The delay didn’t slow down
the Generals as they cruised to a
9-0 victory.

The doubles teams of Ap-
plegate and Tabb, Weston and
Wortham and Kristen McClung
and Will recorded victories.

In the singles matches, Apple-
gate defeated Pomona-Pitzer’s
Siobhan Finicane 4-6, 6-2, 10-8.
W&L would sweep the ﬁve re-
maining matches without drop-
ping another set.

Later on Saturday, the No. 1-
ranked Generals took on No. 5
Williams, with a much different
result.

The Ephs got off to a strong
start by winning No. l and No. 2
doubles.

W&L’s duo of McClung and
Caire won No. 3 doubles, defeat-
ing Geni Loomis and Ashley Par-
sons 8-6.

In the singles competition,
Applegate, Will, and McClung
recorded victories to split the sin-
gles matches 3-3, but it was not
enough as Williams handed the
Generals their ﬁrst defeat of the
season, 5-4.

The women rebounded by-

wrapping up the tournament on
Sunday with a 9-0 thrashing of
hosts Trinity University to run
their record to 14-1.

The Generals will conclude
regular season play with four
matches over spring break.

The team will look to wrap up
another undefeated conference
season before heading to Atlanta
for a match at Emory University
Tuesday, April 17. That will be

a rematch of last year’s national
championship match. .
The ﬁnal regular season match
will be the next day at Sewanee.
If, as expected, the Generals
romp through the ODAC t0uma-
ment and take the title during the
ﬁnal weekend of spring break,
they will then turn their attention
to the NCAA team and individual
championships in May at Mary
Washington in Fredericksburg.

Why you
should be  
excited

‘ Lewis explains
- why now is the

time to be a fan

By Adam Lewls
COLUMNIST

Despite everything negative
that surrounds modem-day sports,
this time of year makes me ex-
tremely proud to be a sports fan.

Your 2:30 Economics class where
vantage, or the buzzer-beater that

next round in the NCAA touma—
ment? Screw comparative, that’s

I mean, which is more inter-

ing Tiger ﬁgure out the slope of
the green on Sunday at the Mas-

give you the derivative, it gives
you a green jacket.

Personally, I can’t think of any
other time in the sports calendar
where I am happier.

First, we have March Mad-
ness. Now I know people say that
there are only two sure things in
the world: death and taxes. But
an exciting March Madness tour-

to that list. Though this touma-
ment started off with only a few
really exciting ﬁrst round games,
it picked up with each round. For
the ﬁrst time ever, all four no. 1
seeds and three no. 2 seeds made
the Elite Eight. I don’t think I
have ever seen more intensity, de-
termination or goofy scrubs lock-
ing arms on the bench thinking
that they make a difference.

April 1 marked the Opening
Day of Major League Baseball,
a day that has an aura surround-
ing it which always seems to take
America from winter to spring.
And, beautiful weather combined
with the smell of hot dogs and
beer can only mean one thing: I’m
going to have to stash the beer to
avoid getting a strike, and then go
watch baseball.

Moving on, the Masters be-
gins this week. No other event
boasts the best players in the
world playing on the most aes-
thetically pleasing course in the
world, without the interference
of commercials and women (just
kidding). But in all seriousness,
I can’t think of many other week-
ends that are more enjoyable than
the Masters. Where else do fat
guys have a decent change of
winning a sports competition?

Next we have the NHL play-
offs, which begin on April 11.
For those of you who may be un-
interested, let me assure you that
the Stanley Cup playoffs are actu-
ally quite entertaining. Any true
sports fan can appreciate fast-
moving, hard-hitting play, espe-
cially when arrest-worthy ﬁghts
are allowed to occur.

Overlapping with the Stanley
Cup playoffs is the post-season
of the NBA. Personally, I have
very little to say about profes-
sional basketball nowadays, but
the playoffs tend to encourage
players to actually play defense,
which is always fun.

Lastly, the weekend of April
28 marks the culmination of the
greatest period on the sports cal-
endar with the NFL draft. Like
when the Jetson’s met the Fline-
stones’, the NFL draft sees two
great organizations meet on the
same stage. And, if you thought
predicting how Fred would react
when he saw George was diffi-
cult, try predicting who the Raid-
ers will select in the ﬁrst round.

There you have it: my favorite
time of year. The time when the
only city you should be studying
is “Upset City, baby!”

fensive onslaught in game two as
the Generals swept

score Roanoke College

on Saturday and
W&L 3v 11 improved their con-
RC 1’ 5 ference record to a

lofty 10-3 mark.

This week was
a busy one for Washington and
Lee. Sunday’s non-conference
match against St. Mary’s was can-
celled, but the team still played
three conference games and one
non-conference game, winning
the three ODAC bouts and losing
to Shenandoah in the non-confer-
ence showing.

The Generals beat the Maroon
3-1 and 11-6 to go along with
Tuesday’s 7-4 win to avenge an
earlier ODAC loss to Bridgewa-
ter College. The sole blemish
on the week was the 10-4 loss to
Shenandoah.

With only ﬁve conference
games left to play, a group of ex-
perienced veterans and talented

youngsters have the Generals
poised for a showdown April 14
with Hampden-Sydney that will
go a long way towards determin-
ing who joins defending champi-
on Virginia Wesleyan at the top of
the conference standings.

Saturday’s doubleheader was
an excellent example of the di-
verse ways this team can win a
baseball game.

Edwards, the team’s undis-
puted ace, gave up an early run
before settling down, allowing
just four hits and the one run over
seven innings. The outing im-
proved his record on the mound
to 5-1 and dropped his ERA to a
sparkling 3.05.

In the meantime, junior out-
ﬁelders Madden and Tim Livings-
ton put W&L back in front with
RBI singles in the second inning.
Senior Catcher Jordan Wesley
who left Tuesday’s game after
tweaking an earlier hamstring
injury, returned to the lineup and
added some insurance with a
home run in the sixth.

The second game was anything
but a pitching duel, as the Gener-
als quickly fell behind the Ma-
roon. Junior John Parker strug-

gled from the outset. Though he
was able to escape a bases-loaded
jam in the ﬁrst, Roanoke struck
hard in the second, scoring ﬁve
runs on six hits. Brennan Thacker
delivered the biggest blow with a
bases-loaded double that brought
three men home.

Parker gave way to sopho-
more Brendan Clark, who pitched
four dominating innings, allow-
ing just two hits and no runs. He
got the win on the afternoon and
improved to 2-0 on the season.
While Clark was silencing Roa-
noke, W&L was getting its own
offense going against Maroon
starter Chase Davidson.

Madden provided the cru-
cial blow of the inning when he
launched a bases-loaded grand
slam. After Madden’s slam, a
double by sophomore Terrence
McKelvey and a single by fresh-
man catcher Will Lewis brought
three more runs to the plate and
put W&L on top for good.

The Generals padded their
lead in the ﬁfth and seventh in-
nings, scoring a pair of runs in
each frame. Livingston brought
home Madden and Edwards with
a single in the ﬁfth, and RBI

singles by Livingston and David
Miller scored runs in the seventh.

Madden ﬁnished the second
game 3-5, needing only a double
to complete the cycle. The of-
fensive outburst during the two
games bumped his batting av-
erage up nearly 30 points and
showed that he may be breaking
out of the mid-season slump he
struggled through during the past
few weeks.

Shenandoah simply dominat-
ed W&L on Thursday, piling up
10 runs against Livingston and
starter Steve Marcott. Shenando-
ah got four un-earned off Marcott
in the third before driving in three
runs in both the ﬁfth and sixth
against Livingston, who has spent
far more time in left ﬁeld than on
the mound this season.

Though Marcott took the loss
and fell to 3-2 on the year, his
ERA dropped to an astonishing
1.73. He has ﬁrmly established
himself as the team’s mid-week
starter.

Golfers look to drop shots '

James wins Lejeune title with two birdies in sudden-death playoff

By Brian Devlne
smrr wmrsn

The Oleander Course at Jekyll
Island Golf Club can be a tricky
opponent. Situated among the
pine trees and lakes of the his-

toric resort off the

Scores Georgia coast, the
James _8 course’s high winds

and challenging de-
Leisman +4 sign has tested golf-

ers since 1963.

On the weekend
of March 23-25, the Washington
and Lee golf team became the
latest to be tamed by Oleander,
ﬁnishing tied for 11”‘ out of 24
teams at the Jekyll Island Inter-
collegiate.

Though this is the ﬁrst time the
team has ﬁnished outside the top
ﬁve of a tournament this year, it
is not a terribly disappointing re-
sult. The Generals placed in the
top half of a ﬁeld including an-
nual D-III title contenders Meth-
odist, Averett and Oglethorpe.
At Jekyll Island the Generals ﬁn-
ished ahead of Averett, the 2003
national champions, and local
rivals Bridgewater, Roanoke and
Hampden-Sydney.

W&L’s ﬁve participants shot
a combined 303, their best round,

on the ﬁnal day to move into a
tie for eleventh place with St.
John Fisher and DePauw, both
of whom led the Generals after
Saturday’s second round. The
Generals ﬁnished with a com-
bined three-round score of 922,
only 14 strokes out of another top
ﬁve ﬁnish.

The compression at the top of
the team leaderboard was remark-
able. Only 25 strokes separated
Illinois Wesleyan and Hampden-
Sydney, who ﬁnished ﬁfth and
nineteenth, respectively. Golfers
struggled with the strong Atlantic
breeze and dogleg-ﬁlled course,
especially during Saturday’s sec-
ond round, where the Generals
carded a combined 311.

The Generals’ ﬁve representa-
tives were led by junior Nathaniel
James, who shot a ﬁrst round 70
(2 under par) and ﬁnished with
220, tied for tenth after the tour-
nament. Seniors Anthony Zap-
pin (231, tied for 47“‘) and Matt
Leisman (233, tied for 55“‘) also
ﬁnished in the top half of the lea-
derboard. Sophomore Beau Al-
len recorded a 238, and freshman
Kevin Trempe, making his varsity
tournament debut, shot a 243 on
the weekend.

James’ 220 helped him win

ODAC player of the week for
golf. A Third Team All—Ameri-
can last season and the reigning
ODAC Golfer of the Year, the
junior from suburban Dallas-Fort
Worth was instrumental in the
Generals’ top-half performance in
Georgia. James is averaging 74.6
strokes per round this season, best
on his team.

Despite James’ efforts and the
overall solid play of the W&L
outﬁt, the tournament was won
by Methodist University, who
won nine national championships
in ten years from 1990 to 1999.
The Monarchs beat out Ogletho-
rpe by eight strokes and were led
by senior Nick Bova. All ﬁve of
Methodist’s golfers ﬁnished in
the top 35. It is little surprise that
the Monarchs are a unanimous
pick for number one in the World
Golf Association Coaches’ Poll
for Division III. After dispatching
the ﬁeld so handily this weekend,
it seems a strong possibility that
Methodist will win its eleventh
championship this year.

Oglethorpe’s Taylor Urbanski
shot a third-round 70 to ultimate-
ly clip Bova for the individual
championship by a single stroke.
Urbanski and Bova were the only
two players to ﬁnish under par

over three rounds.

This weekend, the golf team
took part in the Marine Federal
Credit Union Intercollegiate at
Camp Lejeune, N.C. James, Leis-
man, Zappin, Joe Gibson and
Brad Watts competed for Gener-
als. On the ﬁrst day, James led the
way shooting a ﬁve-under-par 65
to lead the team to an eighth place
ﬁnish after day one. Zappin was
also under par, shooting a 68.

On day two, James led the way
again shooting a 69 on the par-72
gold course giving him a two day
total of 134, good enough for sec-
ond place. Leisman’s 71 was good
for one-under-par.

On day three, James again led
the way shooting a 72 which tied
him for ﬁrst place overall. In the
playoﬁ‘, he birded two holes in a
row to win the title. ‘

“It was quite a way to win,” he
said.

Overall, the Generals shot
305 on day three to ﬁnish with a
score of 879, good enough for 12”‘
place.

“It wasn’t a bad showing but
it wasn’t quite what we were ex-
pecting,” said James.

The Generals continue their
season on April l6 at the W&L
Buck Leslie Invitational.

New athletic center

Football stadium renovations put on hold for ﬁeld house contruction

By Michael Keenan
sponrs EDITOR

In a stunning change of plans,
the Washington and Lee Athletics
Department has announced that
they will postpone the rebuilding
of Wilson Stadium and instead
construct a ﬁeld house.

The ﬁeld house will beneﬁt
the entire student population and
be useful to all athletic teams on
campus. The proposed ﬁeld house
would contain an indoor track,
new pool, and a variety of other
facilities.

When asked about the change
in plans, a source speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said, “We
realized that football wasn’t the
only team that had a good season
this year. The men’s swim team
has won four consecutive Blue-
grass Mountain Conference titles

- — a conference which included Di-

vision II and NAIA teams — and
sent seven swimmers to nationals
where they placed 8*. The cross
country teams have won the past
three ODAC titles with the track
program on the rise and yet dur-
ing the indoor season they have to
walk to VMI’s outdated track just
to practice. The new ﬁeld house
will serve a wider selection of
students and show W&L strives
to recognize all athletic teams, not
just football.”

The new facility will allow
the swimming and track teams to
host conference championships
on campus. Last year, the ODAC
indoor championships were tech-
nically hosted by W&L, but be-
cause there was no facility on
campus, the championship meet
was held at Liberty University.

The new pool will be Olym-
pic-sized which will allow the
entire team to practice at the same
time withoutbeing overcrowded.

Track coaches Nathan Hoey and Brandon Uhl celebrate the announcement of the
new field house. Hoey and Ulh were also excited about their new sweater vests.

Additionally, the pool will
have a diving well so the swim
teams can expand to once again
being a swimming and diving
team.

“As great as our eighth place
ﬁnish was a nationals, it’s disap-
pointing to know that there’s two
more diving events we couldibe
earning points in but can’t be-
cause we don’t have the facili-
ties,” said one swimmer.

The track team’s pole vaulters
and throwers were also excited
about the news.

“Finally our practices won’t
be dependent on the weather,”
said one pole vaulter. “lt’s nice
to know the administration cares

about our improvement and safe-
ty.”
“It will be great not to have to
ﬁght with the Fancy Dress deco-
rations committee for practice
space,” said an excited thrower.

While training for the indoor
season, the throwershad to train
in the pavilion, which was also
used by the decorations commit-
tee.

The training facilities would
provide a backup practice area for
W&L’s many athletic teams. Pri-
ority would be given to in-season
sports so they would not have to
miss practice due to poor weather
conditions but out-of-season var-
sity sports, club team, and intra-

mural leagues would also beneﬁt.

“It will be much easier to
schedule intramurals with the ad-
ditional facilities,” said a source
inside. the intramural department.
“While it’s understandable that
varsity sports have ﬁrst priority,
it’s hard having to reschedule, es-
pecially during playoffs.”

Additionally, the ﬁeld house
would provide an alternate site
for graduation in case of inclem-
ent weather so seniors could grad-
uate at W&L rather than having to
go to VMI.

Construction is expected to
begin in May and be completed
by January, 2008. Bidding for
naming rights is still in progress.
