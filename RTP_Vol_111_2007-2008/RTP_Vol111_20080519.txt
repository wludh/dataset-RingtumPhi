W&L’s own
“Secret Garden”

Produce grown on campus
to beneﬁt Campus Kitchens
Project and Dining Hall

By Rosemary Kelley
STAFF w RITER

The Biology department has created a community
garden to be used for the Campus Kitchens Project
(CKP) and Dining Services.

The garden is located at the back of campus, past
the baseball ﬁelds. The land was previously dedicat-
ed to biological studies and composting. For the last
week, the land has undergone a transformation into a
garden. _

Biology professor Bill Hamilton and Enviromnen-
tal Management coordinator Chris Wise are spear-
heading the transformation. Through their dedication
and with the help of several student and faculty vol-
unteers, the plot now has a variety of vegetables and
herbs in the ground. There are several species of to-
matoes, peppers, beans, squash, okra, cucumbers, and
herbs.

The garden uses the compost pile created by stu-
dents to enhance nutrients in the soil. In doing so,
this project will potentially inspire more student in-
volvement in environmental problems and spark new
solutions.

Volunteer planter Sarah Thomsberry said, “It was
a really fun experience to plant tomatoes in the com-
munity garden and to think that the vegetables har-
vested next year from the garden will be consumed on
campus in the Marketplace and around the community
through Campus Kitchens.”

Thomsberry added, “As a CKP volunteer, I am
really looking forward to using the basically organic
garden produce in the Campus Kitchens’ meals. The
fresh vegetables are not only going to offer a lot of
nutrition but will also add variation for the different
components of the meals.”

CKP will have the opportunity to use these garden-

grown vegetables and herbs. Instead of using canned
vegetables, students can creat bean salads from scratch.
Professor Hamilton sees the garden as a way to teach
meal recipients about nutrition and health. Student
volunteers will teach about the ways to create healthy
meals from vegetables and meats.

CKP Coordinator Robbie Turner sees the garden as
a way to move toward new options for CKP clients.
Herbs will be incorporated into sauces to put on meat
and other prepared dishes. CKP is extremely excited
about this way to expand the types of meals prepared.

Dining Services will incorporate the local herbs
into dishes next. year. In using local products, the uni-
versity will support Rockbridge County. This increas-
es the environmental sustainability of the campus as
the Marketplace chooses fresh, home-grown products.
Dining Services already incorporates local products
into its meals.

The upkeep of the garden will be accomplished
through student volunteer work. There will be a CKP
shift devoted to the produce.

Professor Hamilton spoke about designing a course
incorporating the study of biology and working with
the produce. This is a great opportunity for the school
to work with students, the community and beyond.
Professor Hamilton has started a project that will tan-
gibly beneﬁt everyone involved: students, faculty and
clients.

Hundreds of Washington and
Lee ‘students, faculty and com-
munity members ﬁlled an area in
front of the Stackhouse Theater
last Thursday, anxiously awaiting
the arrival of Bill Nye, popular
television host and science educa-
tor.

Everyone was packed in like
sardines as they waited for the
door of the theater to be opened.
When it ﬁnally opened around
7:10 p.m., the hopeful attendees
pushed themselves forward excit-
edly, swarming into the theater to
claim one of about 200 coveted
seats.

As soon as the introducer ap-
peared on stage, the audience
loudly chanted, “Bill! Bill! Bill!”

Many fans of Bill Nye the Sci-
ence Guy remember him as the
goofy scientist with neverend-
ing experiments on lighthearted
science topics. This time how-
ever, Nye was prepared to discuss
something more serious — global
warming.

But even with this serious top-
ic, Nye did not forget to exercise
his sense of humor, which drew
appreciative laughter from the au-
‘dience.

“Mercury is too close to the
Sun and Mars is too far from the

Sun in order for life to exist,” said
Nye. He added, “Venus is way
too hot because of its thick atmo-
sphere. We used to call it venereal
atmosphere instead of venusian
atmosphere, but that adjective got
used somewhere else.”

“The Earth here is just right.
And this, my friend, is the joy
of discovery,” said Nye. “That is
what science is all about.”

Freshman Catherine Anderson
said that Nye’s speech was engag-
ing even for people who are not
very knowledgeable in science.

“Bill Nye did a good job of
weaving humor into his presenta-
tion in order to make it more in-

' teresting,” she said. “Even the fact
that his slideshow was peppered
with little jokes here and there
made you really want to keep
watching.” '

Nye attacked the issue of global
warming from several angles, ex-
amining everything from Argen-
tina’s Upsala Glacier, which has
completely melted in the past 80
years, to environemntally-friendly
vehicles such as the Prius.

“Everywhere in the world ex-
cept the United States, people
talk about climate change all the
time,” he said. “The key to our
future is not having people to do
less. We’ve got to ﬁnd ways to do
more with less. That is what I want

you to do.”

According to Nye, many
households in China use a solar
hot water system because it is free
heat. Nye’s own house is equipped
with solar panels on the roof. “My
electric bills are $7 a month,” he
said. “This is a huge unexploited
resource in the United States.”

Nye also discussed the pos-
sibility of getting ﬁve times as
much energy as we need from the
turbines on a wind farm. He joked
about investing in this area. “You
would get rich! You would change
the world!”

“Global warming and going
green are obviously really big is-
sues right now, and I often hear
people talking about them,” said
Anderson. “A lot of the times,
though, it seems like people are
just talking about it because it’s

‘the fashionable thing to talk about

right now, so it continues to be
really vague to a lot of people. I
think Bill Nye did a good job of
actually talking about speciﬁcs
and giving us reasonable ideas of
how we can ‘change the world.”
Freshman Lauren Miller was a
bit disappointed with Nye’s talk;
she did not expect Nye to talk
about environmental issues. Rath-
er, she thought he would perform
some science experiments that he
had done during his TV career.

COURTESY OF BECKY GUYNN

“I thought his message about
global warming was interesting
even though I was aware of this
issue previously. I also felt like
he was saying a lot of things that I ~
hear emphasized in the media on a
regular basis and didn’t necessar-
ily need to hear again.”

“I don’t need to wait an hour
and a half to hear someone talk
about an issue I can hear about ev-
ery single day if I just turn on the
TV or get on the Internet,” Miller
said. “Global warming is an issue
I often get tired of hearing about
because it’s emphasized so much
in the media already. Most of us
know ways we can be taking care
of the enviromnent; it’s still up to
us to decide whether or not we’re
going to implement them, regard-
less of how often we hear about
them.”

Some might have been im-
pressed and some might have been
disappointed by Bill Nye, but it is
clear that he delivered an obvious
but important message to the com-
ing generation about global warm-
ing.
“There is no cavalry com-
ing over the hill. This is where
we make our stand,” Nye said.
“Shouldn’t we be taking better
care of our world?”

Heading into the eyeof the storm

Johnston shares his experience as President of the NY Stock Exchange during 9/I1 tragedy

By John Henderson
STAFF WRITER

On September ll, 2001, when the
streets of Manhattan were ﬂooded
with people heading north, the Presi-
dent of the New York Stock Exchange
was ﬁghting to go south—William
R. Johnston ‘6l wanted to get back
to the World Trade Center to lend a
hand.

Going east, then south, then west,
Johnston arrived at Ground Zero
shortly after the ﬁrst of the two World
Trade Towers came crashing to the
ground. “It’s a sound I will never
forget in my life,” Johnston said to
a small audience of W&L students,
professors and administrators last
Tuesday. “I thought it was an earth-
quake.”

With the ﬁrst tower in ruins and
the second on the verge of collapse,
Johnston helped form a triage sys-
tem to get medical attention for the
wounded as they came out of the
World Trade Center. At the time,
Johnston was 62 years old and a

grandfather.

Although Johnston might be bet-
ter remembered for his nearly 50-
year career in the New York Stock
Exchange as a trader and later its
President, his actions in the days fol-
lowing the September llth attacks

“It is a sound] will
never forget in my life. I
thought it was an earth-

quake. ”

WILLIAM R. JOHNSTON, former
Presldent of the New York Stock
Exchange and W&L alumnus

deﬁne him as a leader.

Johnston was the second of two
speakers in the “Lessons on Leader-
ship” series sponsored by the Office
of Leadership Development.

The attacks left New York City in
a state of disarray. On the west side

of Broadway, a “grayout” was caus-

mg power outages and disrupting
intemet and cell phone connections.
The east side, on the other hand,
was relatively functional. The Stock
Exchange had to make a choice—
whether to keep Wall Street running
during those hectic days or stop it.

“What do you do when 50 per-
cent of your players can’t come to
the game?” Johnston asked. “We felt
the better part of valor was to shut it
down.”

Instead of letting one half of Wall
Street proﬁt while the other half was
incapacitated, Johnston allowed ev-
eryone time to get back on their feet.
“You’ve got to do what’s right for the
public,” he said.

Johnston said he is grateful for
the honor system, which helped him
make good decisions during his long
career as a trader, business owner and
executive.

He offered two pieces of advice
for graduating Washington and Lee
students: “Find a job that you can be
passionate about, that every day you

can enjoy... Find a partner that you
can be passionate with.”

J ohnston’s talk was attended by 15
people in the Outing Club Resource
room, including Burr Datz, the direc-
tor of Leadership Development and
coordinator of Religious Life. When
asked what makes Johnston a great
leader, Datz replied, “His enthusi-
asm. .. and the twinkle in his eye.”

Students and faculty chatted with
Johnston after a question and answer
session. “I think the key word for
this talk is real,” said junior Yan Yan,
a Philosophy major. “Real life expe-
rience.”

Johnston is retired from Wall
Street and says he is in the “give-
back” stage of life, investing time
and money in foundations for cancer
research and holistic learning, his
church in New Jersey, his alma mater,
Washington and Lee, and his wife’s
alma mater, Hollins University. They
have been married for 46 years.

Gates addresses VMI :9 graduating class, relays importance of public service

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

For the fourth year in a row,
the number of Virginia Military
Institute (VMI) students joining
the military has increased. One
hundred and twenty-nine mem-
bers — or about 52 percent — of
the Class of 2008 became ofﬁcers
in the Army, Navy, Air Force or
Marine Corps last weekend dur-
ing VMI’s graduation ceremo-
nies. In 2005, about 40-percent
of VMI graduates joined the
military.

And for the second time in
three years, the graduates heard
from the U.S. Secretary of De-
fense.

“One of the strengths of the
United States is institutions like
VMI,” Secretary of Defense
Robert Gates told the graduates
and their guests. “From Kabul
to Kirkuk, former VMI cadets
are serving throughout the armed
forces and the U.S. government
in many roles.” '

But not all VMI students are
waiting until graduation to start
their service. Gates said that 75
cadets have been called to active
duty since 2001; and 41 of those
cadets have been deployed over-
seas. There are currently 10 VMI
students serving in either Iraq or
Afghanistan.

Gates, who was Director of
the Central Intelligence Agency
from 1991-1993 and was presi-
dent of Texas A&M University
before replacing Donald Rums-
feld as secretary in December
2006, told the crowd that his

uation speeches brief.

ducing graduates who serve the
United States in more than just
military life.

“We believe we can make
the lives of others better and can
make a difference and a contri-
bution to the greatest country on
Earth,” Gates said.

Gates drew heavily on the
imagery of America’s citizen sol-
diers, speaking at length about a
1980 VMI graduate and member
of the Army Reserves who is
currently serving in Northeastern
Afghanistan.

Col. Jonathan Ives, who com-
mands about 1,000 troops, named
his unit Task Force Cincinnatus,
a tribute to the Roman general
who laid down his weapons and
returned to farming after leading
the Roman legions to victory.

“The citizen soldier is no
myth,” Gates said. “He is real.”

Gates said that Ives has been

citizens that he and many of his

Washington was president of
the society from its formation in
1783 until his death in 1799.
Gates continued his discussion
of the citizen soldier by invok-
ing the words of General George
Marshall, a 1901 VMI graduate
who served as Chief of Staff dur-

ing World War II and Secretary
of State under President Harry
Truman. Gates reminded the
graduates that they are trained to
be more than just soldiers.

“Our graduates seldom amass

' great wealth,” Marshall said in

1940, “but just as seldom do they
display weakness or indifference
to their duties as citizens. They
are trained to be soldiers, if there
be need for soldiers.... But what
is far more important, they are
trained to be good citizens.”
Being a good citizen often
leads to criticism, Gates warned.
He reminded the graduates that

“Our country faces many

Gates said. “We live in a time

The stakes are too high. And it
is precisely during these times

Correction: Last week’s article said the forum was titled “Do students really
respect each other?” The forum’s actual title was “R-E-S—P—E-C—T: What does it
really mean to you?”

. Article inaccurate,
  missed the point

“Hide ” article needs to check its facts;
does the weight of freedom of the press

equal honor, respect among students?

To the Editor:

I am responding to last week’s “What’s there to hide?” article.
The article raised many questions in my mind. Who is the au-
thor? Why is no author listed? Who are the sources? Why were
the people involved not given a chance to comment? Why was
the article not fact checked (at least not very well)? The article
asserts that Larry and the administration turned a NPR reporter
away at the front door. Larry and the administration did not turn
her away at the door. She did not even try to come to the event.
The article is also critical of the administration’s refusal to an-
swer questions about the punishment of the bracket’s authors.
They could not have answered the questions because the hearing
did not take place until the following night. Furthermore, Dean
Watkins and the administration are bound by law from disclosing
information about student conduct matters.

The Phi interviewed me about the conversation, but I do not
recall being asked for a comment about reporters’ ability to at-
tend the conversation. Had I been given the chance to comment,
this is what I would have said. You correctly reported that the R-
E-S-P-E-C-T discussion was “a chance for students, faculty and
administrators to talk about whether or not students and faculty
respect each other.” You will notice that reporters were not part
of that list. The campus conversation was intended to be produc-
tive and allow for anyone with a view to express it in a safe envi-
ronment. Having a reporter from NPR at the conversation would
have allowed students’ comments to be aired on the radio and
would have likely inhibited frank and productive conversation.
Once Iwas made aware of outside reporters’ desire to attend the
conversation, I wanted to make sure they would not be permitted
in the room. This was not the unilateral action of the administra-
tion as the article suggests.

Looking back at the events of the last couple of months, I
hope we can move past the question of whether newspapers have
the right to publish offensive material. Instead, let us consider
whether they should publish it. Do we as students, do we as a
university support the publishing of these verbal assaults? Do we
think this stuff should be in the public discourse at a university
that prides itself on honor and respect? Are we living up to our
ideals, that include developing harmonious relationships among
students (university mission statement)? I hope that the R-E-S-
P-E-C-T conversation shifted the discussion away from the list
and the bracket and toward the way we should treat each other. I
hope that conversation will continue on the hill, in the dorms and
in the fraternity and sorority houses. If you were not able to at-
tend the conversation, talk to someone who did. There were lots
of great ideas expressed about what we can do moving forward.
Let’s start thinking a little more before we write or say something
and ponder the effect of those words.

Joys of Spring Term

Homework, allure of sunbathing create a balancing act

By Celeste Cruz-Carandang
and Joan Oguntlmlen
co L u M N I s r s

It’s Spring Terrn—one of the
best opportunities this school
offers. It provides the chance
to study abroad, take interest-
ing courses or simply take some
time off. And though it sucks that
friends at other schools have al-
ready started their summer vaca-
tion, students here can still enjoy
something close to a spring vaca-
tion.

Upon registration, I knew that
this institution would be academi-
cally challenging. For one of the
very ﬁrst times in my life, I had to
do all the reading and homework
and actually study for ﬁnals. My
very ﬁrst 8 a.m. class made it
clear that I was not in high school
anymore.

Yet as the terms progressed my
friends began telling me how great
Spring Term was. They ﬁlled my
mind with stories of Goshen, the
Maury River and Panther Falls.
Even the inner tubes in the book-
store portended six weeks full of
slipping and sliding. .

Now I realize that Spring Term
is not simply about fun and games.
That is the mythical Spring Term.
No one can just party every night
and still make the grade. Behind
that hedonistic facade of Monday
through Friday parties is a student
hurrying to ﬁnish her reading.

who fail to recognize the dual
facets of this rare opportunity.
Although I am sure there are
students who are too studious,
it seems that the majority would
spend all of their time, including
class time, partying. They trade
Spring Term for spring vacation

My friends began telling me how great Spring

Term was. T hey ﬁlled my mind with stories of
Goshen, the Maury River and Panther Falls...

That is the mystical Spring Term.

At the same time, it is not a
solely academic experience. After
24 weeks of intense academics,
albeit peppered with more than
a few parties, it would be impos-
sible for anyone to spend another
six weeks cooped up in their room
with an open textbook. Instead,
the real Spring Term is about bal-
ance.

Unfortunately, there are those

and somehow fail to attend most
of their classes. It’s bafﬂing.

How hard can it be to attend
class for two or three hours two or
three times a week? When there
are only about 12 classes in the
term, missing half of your classes
is an appeal for failure. But we
guess those who get less than av-
erage grades during Spring Term
can always look back and say,

“Hey, I might have failed that
class, but at least I made good
memories.”

Though there is a lot of reading
involved for most of the Spring
Term courses, the course material
tends to be appealing. Because
it’s so relaxed and stress-free,
Spring Term actually provides a
better learning environment. Af-
ter spending two or more hours
reading and then attending class
for two or three more hours, it’s
due reward to spend the evening
partying, sleeping, hanging out or
doing absolutely nothing at all.
There’s time to do it all.

Yet, I must still concede that
this term has been extremely en-
joyable. It is true that I am not
tubing or tanning everyday. To my
great surprise, I do spend some
days studying and writing papers
like it’s Winter Term rather than
four weeks into the last term of
my freshman experience. W&L is
truly a unique place. That much is
obvious. It seems that our brand
of student is not only intelligent
and studious, but can also pull off
a 20-page term paper after a trip
to Panther Falls.

Act against dictatorship

We need to intervene in Burma, ﬁght evil, stop fooling around

By Abel Delgado
C 0 L U M N I ST

The numbers are enough to
make anyone with a conscience
cringe, despair and resolve to
act. Anywhere from 130,000 to
400,000 dead, while many more
are starving, homeless and with-
ering away in the most unsanitary
conditions imaginable. They are
left defenseless iii the aftermath
of Cyclone Nargis.

Unfortunately, the brutal mili-
tary junta in control of Burma has
no conscience and is not only fail-
ing to act but is also doing its best
to prevent others from doing so,
ensuring the deaths of hundreds of
thousands, if not millions, more.

“Cruel” doesn’t begin to de-
scribe the inhumanity of these
thugs. The word “savagery” does
not do their actions justice. Now,
two million of their citizens are
at risk due to hunger and disease
not because of the cyclone but be-
cause these sad excuses for men
block international aid workers
from crossing their borders.

The military leaders may be
brutal, but they aren’t foolish.
They know if the international
community is allowed to save
their people in ways they cannot,
then they will be discredited and
their grip on power will be loos-
ened if not dissolved completely.
So they would rather turn their
back on their dying citizens so
they can guard against “foreign
intervention.” Apparently the
worst of men can do far more
harm than the worst of nature.

So what are we going to do
about it? _

The argument that a humani-
tarian intervention would violate
their sovereignty was null and
void the moment the junta was
unwilling to help or accept that
others help their citizens. French
Foreign Minister and world-re-
nowned humanitarian Bernard
Kouchner raised the prospect of a
“forced” intervention by invoking
the U.N. doctrine of the “respon-
sibility to protect.” Not only does
the civilized world, the world that
cannot see innocent people perish

without reason, have a right to in-
tervene, but we have a responsi-
bility to do so.

If we can drop bombs, then we
can drop food. If we can build a
“Coalition of the Willing” to de-
pose a dictator, we can build one
to save a people.

The situation in Burma right
now is a stronger case for imme-
diate intervention than was Iraq
in 2003, Afghanistan in 2001 and
Kosovo in 1999. In the aftermath
of September llth, we warned
rogue dictators that they were ei-
ther with us or with the terrorists.
There is no middle ground. If we
fail to save the Burmese, then we
are against them and with their
rogue dictators.

The critics and cynics argue
that the junta is rightfully para-
noid that Western aid is a cover-
up for a Western takeover of their
country. We intervene and depose
dictators too much, and we have
a record of creating chaos when
doing so.

So they too would rather turn
their backs and watch people

die instead of saving them. They
criticize their governments be-
cause, unlike the Burmese, they
can. Regardless of whether or
not their governments intervene,
these cynics will continue to live
comfortably in the West while the
Burmese suffer endlessly.

If saving people causes dic-
tators to fall, where’s the harm?
Granted, there can be unforseen
consequences and chaos, but this
pales in comparison to the harm
caused by letting these people
die. _

The greater evil is not what the
junta has done but what we are
currently failing to do. Instead of
sitting back and waiting for these
vile rulers to give us “permission”
to enter the ravaged areas, we
should stand up and not wait for
the catastrophe to get worse.

Two million people are on the
verge of dying. The time for the
free people and democratic gov-
ernments of the world to save the
oppressed and ravaged people of
Burma is now.

Make honor into a lifestyle

Sexual assault should not mean less than other honor violations, especially here

Once upon a time, I thought
that “honor” meant holding your-
self to a higher level of integrity
because of a certain duty that you
felt towards your fellow human.
However, upon coming to Wash-
ington and Lee, I learned that
honor means withholding from
“lying, cheating and stealing” be-
cause it is in the rules. We vehe-
mently disclaim being part of an
honor “code” because a long time
ago, we believed that we were
above relying on speciﬁc coded
rules to tell us how to behave cor-
rectly.

However, the treatment that
I have observed, read about and
experienced tells me that our cur-
rent deﬁnition must only follow
the rules. While there are many
infractions on what I would call
a true honor system, the discon-
tinuities which bother me the
most are the real honor violations
against the women on this campus
(which are not in the books).

On an everyday level, wom-
en at W&L have to watch their
backs. We must lock our doors
every night, not because we are
scared of strangers getting into

the building, but because we are
scared of our own classmates
getting drunk and breaking into
our rooms. At parties, we have
to travel in groups and monitor
who we talk to, for how long we
talk, and exactly how we do it so
as not to give anyone the wrong
idea. The sad thing is that on this
campus, the wrong idea can lead
to a life-shattering experience.
What is even sadder is that it hap-
pens more often than anyone will
admit.

I realize that these instances
occur everywhere” However, I
once thought that we held our-
selves at a standard above ev-
eryone else. Furthermore, our
sexual assault statistics and gener-
ally sexist practices show that we
aren’t even par with “everyone”
else. Many times, we are below
them. Yes, a school which prides
itself on its high “unenforced”
honorability does not treat its
women well enough to even be
considered average.

Recently, many students have
expressed wary feelings toward
the Student-Faculty-Hearing
Board, which is the only deﬁni-
tive place on campus in which
people can be expelled for sexual
misconduct. Students have called
it secretive even though the ano-

nymity with which it associates
itself helps to ensure a safer envi-
ronment for victims of sexual mis-
conduct. Other people have cried
out against its “unlawfulness,”
and “refusal” to have witnesses,
cross-examinations, or evidence.
These claims are all false. The
SFHB allows and encourages all
of the above. However, very few
of us know anything about that
because we do not know anything
about the SFHB. This greatly con-
cerns me because it means that we
do not know anything about how
to prosecute sexual misconduct
on campus even though it hap-
pens here twice as often as it does
nationally. What does that tell
you about the respect that we dis-
play for women? It tells me that
we do not care enough about their
welfare to bother knowing the
ways to assure that they are given
justice after having been incred-
ibly violated.

The fact that people were out-
raged at the SFHB’s ability to
expel people tells me that sexual
assault doesn’t mean as much to
us as a “normal” honor violation.
It is ﬁne to expel people for cheat-
ing, but it is unacceptable to ex-
pel people for violating others in
the most personal ways possible?
Where is the honor in that?

Women at W&L are left out of
any type of honor system that pro-
tects their personal safety, which
is the type that we need. Frankly,
I am tired of having to lock my
door and monitor how I act be-
cause the students around me
only care about offenders who lie,
cheat or steal. I am tired of people
defending the words “pretentious
slut” because it “wasn’t meant” to
be sexist or to threaten anyone.

I am really tired of listening
to people outrage about “unjust
tribunals” when they should be
outraged that we need a board
speciﬁcally to deal with sexual
misconduct towards women. Ev-
ery time we, the students, redeﬁne
the honor system into a smaller
realm which ﬁts our needs and
does not hold us accountable for
anything, we are hurting our-
selves. But usually, we are hurt-
ing women on campus the most.

It is time for us to realize that
there is more to honor than what
is in the rules. Honor should be
more than that. It should be a
lifestyle, rather than a Monday
through Friday obligation. It
should be something that we are
proud of; it should be a distin-
guishing factor of our lives, in-
stead of a distinguishing aspect of
our school work.

Musical promises flair

Cast and crew bring twists to familiar production

By Celeste Cruz-carandang
surr WRITER

Washington and Lee theater
promises “Murder, intrigue and
famel” in its own production of
Little Shop of Horrors. From
May 22 until May 25, the show
will be running in Keller The-
atre.

Although a well-known mu-
sical, the play promises to be a
unique and thrilling experience.
This will not be the average high
school production.

Little Shop tells the story of
Seymour Krelbom. Krelborn is
an overly studious orphan who
ﬁnds a unique opportunity in
Skid Row: Mushnik’s ﬂower
shop.

He meets adventure and
mystery in the form of a man-
eating plant that he names aﬂer
his crush and co-worker Audrey
Fulquard. I

This ironically named Au-
drey II has an odd penchant
for both human ﬂesh and show
tunes. He begins to sing for his
supper and consume various
characters in the play. Krelborn
begins to lose control of Audrey
II and himself.

Audiences will be on the edge
of their seats as they wait to see
who gets Audrey ﬁrst: Audrey II
or Krelbom.

Despite the familiar play, the
cast and crew ensure that this
will be quite an exceptional ex-
perience. Kimber Wiggs, a cast

member, revealed, “The costum-
ing is fantastic. And musically,
everyone can look forward to
that Josh Harvey ﬂair‘ as he
leads our band.” Harvey seems
to be adding a lot of musical
ﬂair by updating the songs and
the score. Another cast member,
Sarah Warsco, said, “We have
done a lot to make this produc-
tion unique. In particular, we
have really put our own twist
on the ﬁnale. Also, the band has

describing another unique twist.

Although the addition of new
elements made the schedule
hectic, all members of the show
seemed to have worked well to-
gether. The cast, the stage and
technical crew and the dance
ensemble were able to integrate
their parts in a harmonious and
intriguing fashion.

According to Francisco, the
extensive rehearsals were an
important part of integrating the

 _

really updated the music and in-
corporated more modern styles
into the musical.”

The director, Professor
Kimberly Jew, also helped to
encourage a revolutionary in-
terpretation of all parts. Samara
Francisco, a member of the en-
semble, said, “All of the actors
have brought something unique
to their characters. They em-
braced the stories of their char-
acters and deliver very convinc-
ing performances.

“Unlike other productions,
the director wanted to incorpo-
rate more elements into animat-
ing the plant,” Francisco added,

elements of the show: “Perhaps
the hardest part of the musical is
how many elements make up the
production. But that is why re-
hearsals with all the performers
and crew members are so essen-
tial:They let you see any glitches
that may not have been notice-
able when only one element of
the production was present.”
Surprisingly enough, the play
has been in rehearsal since Win-
ter term. Wiggs, who has been
featured in both Little Shop and
the One Acts, contrasts the two
shows. “For one thing, the pro-
cess has been much longer. . .we
started learning music Winter

term. It has also been much

. more intense. One Acts was sort

of laid back, and there were only
four people in our cast. But it’s
also really exciting to be work-
ing on the big stage.”

Francisco comments on the
difference in schedules for the
actors and the dancers. “People
who sing, dance and act...have
been working nonstop for the
past four weeks.”

As one of those fortimate
singers, dancers and actors,
Warsco admits that “as an en-
semble member, the rehearsal
schedule has been fun, frustrat-
ing and a challenge. There are
times when it seems that you
will never get all of your work
done and the musical is taking
over half your life, but at other
times you cannot believe how
much fun you’re having. It’s
hard work, but it’s deﬁnitely
worth it.”

With such an exciting plot
and the hard work of the cast
and crew, Little Shop of Hor-
rors is worth seeing. Any previ-
ous familiarity with the musical
should not keep audiences away.
The directors have strived to en-
courage new interpretations in
all aspects of the show. Even for
those who cringe at the sound
of a Broadway show tune, the
music includes enjoyable rock
elements. All in all, Little Shop
promises a little something for
everyone.

Sophomore Lauren Caire’s _
stellar performance in the
NCAA tournament led the
team to a runner-up fin-
ish. Caire dropped only one

partner junior Katie Tabb.

By Kevin Corn
STAFF WRITER

For the fourth consecutive
year, the women’s tennis team
found itself playing for a na-
tional title. For the ﬁrst time,
however, the Generals were
the defending champions.

The team had gone unde-
feated all year and held the
No. 1 ranking throughout
the season. Friday, however,
Williams College ended the
perfect year and captured the
crown in a 5-4 match.

The women started off
strong in the first round with
a win against Hunter, 5-0, in
Monroeville, Pennsylvania.
They went on to compete
against Carnegie Mellon, who
was ranked No. 7.

Fighting against Carnegie
Mellon, the Generals came
away with a fairly simple
win of 5-2. The Generals won
two out of their three doubles
matches, while dropping only

one singles match. Among
the stellar performancers was
sophomore Lauren Caire, who
defeated Carnegie Mellon’s
Kelly Hart 6-0, 6-0. After this
win, the Generals advanced to
the quarterﬁnals in Saint Peter,
Minnesota.

During the quarterﬁnals,
the Generals took down Gus-
tavus Adolphus 5-3 with wins
from Lauren Caire, Leah
Weston and Rebecca Tim-
mis in the singles matches.
In doubles, the Generals were
led to victory with wins from
the teams of Katie Tabb and
Caire, and Virginia Dickinson
and Kelly Will. With this win,
it was on to the semiﬁnals
against Denison.

While up against Deni-
son, the Generals took yet
another victory 5-4. Victories
in this match came from Will,
Weston and Meg Splaitta, in
the singles while in doubles,
the teams of Caire and Tabb,
and freshman Catherine Reed

and Weston defeated Denison
to lead the Generals to their ﬁ-
nal victory in the match.

In the ﬁnal match against
Williams, the Generals nar-
rowly missed repeating their
title, 5-4. Wins came from
Timmis and Splaitta in the sin-
gles games, while the teams of
Tabb and Caire, and Dickin-
son and Will took victories in
the doubles competition.

And so it was on to the in-
dividual singles and doubles
tournament with Tabb and
Caire representing the Gen-
erals. In doubles, the team of
Tabb and Caire defeated Sal-
lie Katter and Kasey Kuenzli
of Linﬁeld College. In singles,
Tabb and Will both were
defeated in the ﬁrst round.
Meanwhile, Caire defeated
Chapman University’s Eliza-
beth Lewis to advance to the
second round. There, Caire
topped Leslie Hansen of MIT
easily 6-3, 6-0.

Saturday afternoon, Caire

played Grace Baljon of Wil-
liams in the quarterﬁnals.
Afterwards, Caire and Tabb
played Amy Staloch and Jen-
nifer Chui of Carnegie Mellon
and lost 5-7, 6-3, 4-6.

Despite being unable to
repeat their national title, the
Generals still ﬁnished with
a 28-1 record — one. that no
other team in the country had
this year.

 

James 3rd at nationals

ODAC champion leads W&L to 16th place in ﬁrst NCAA trip since 199]

By Russ Weems
STAFF WRITER

Nathaniel James has built
a name for himself as one of
the best golfers in Division
III. This week, he got to bring
his Washington and Lee team-
mates along to join in the fun.

W&L competed in the
NCAA Division III Golf
Championships held at the
Chateau Elan Resort in Bra-
selton, Ga. The tournament
went from Tuesday to Friday
and featured 35 teams with
180 golfers in total.

Though James, a senior,
has played in the national
tournament before as an indi-
vidual, the entire team quali-
ﬁed this year after capturing
the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference title.

That title was W&L’s
ﬁrst conference win since
1999, and this was W&L’s
ﬁrst NCAA tournament since
1991.

James took home ODAC
Player of the Year honors and
was also named the confer-
ence’s scholar-athlete of the
year in golf. .

W&L started the ﬁrst round
with a score of 323, or 39 over
par. This was good enough for
22nd out of the 35 teams com-
peting. The Generals trailed
leader La Verne by 33 strokes.
James led the Generals with a
2-over-par 73. This was good
enough for ninth place out
of the 180 competitors. He
trailed leader Scott Harris of
St. John Fisher by 5 strokes.
Sophomore Joe Gibson was
the second best Generals with
a score of 82.

The second round produced
similar results to the ﬁrst for
the Generals. Although they
improved their score by 8
shots, they remained in 22nd
place. James booked another
solid round of 74, moving him
into 6th place overall, trailing

the leader by 8 strokes. Gib-
son recorded the second best
score with a 79.

The Generals had a big
round in the third day of the
tournament. They recorded
the third bestscore of the day
with a 294, just three strokes
back of the best round of the
day, posted by Methodist.

The score was good enough
to move the Generals up to
15th. James again posted the
leading round for the Generals
with a l-over 72, moving him
into 3rd place overall.

Even though James had his
best round of the tournament,
the difference for the Generals
was the rest of the team, who
matched James’ impressive
round.

The rest of the team all
scored between 73 and 77, a
big improvement over the pre-
vious two days, when several
members of the team recorded
scores in the 805.

Every member of the team
had his best round of the tour-
nament that day.

The Generals could not
continue the momentum into
the ﬁnal round on Friday and
remained relatively unchanged
in the team standings.

They dropped one place
and ﬁnished the tournament
16th of the 35 teams after re-
cording a ﬁnal round score of
308. W&L ﬁnished with a to-
tal team score of 1240 (+104)
which left them 48 strokes
back of 1st place St. John’s. A

James again showed con-
sistency with a ﬁnal round
score of 73. His 4-day total of
292 tied him for 3rd place out
of the 180 individual competi-
tors.

Brad Watts ﬁnished 70th,
Gibson 87th, Tim Gavr-
ich 106th, and Matt Langan
110th.
