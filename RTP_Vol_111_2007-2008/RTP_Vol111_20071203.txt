Lexington City Council will meet Thurs-
day night to discuss the future of the Jordan’s
Point dam. The dam’s future has been uncer-
tain since Charles Volpe, a 16-year-old student
of Rockbridge County High School, drowned
there in April 2006.

If the city decides to remove the dam, the
normally still water near the Pole Houses may
once again become a ﬂowing river.

Since Lexington opened Jordan’s Point
Park, the tiny island has become a popular
hangout and swimming hole for students of all
kinds. Local high school students, Keydets,
law students and W&L undergrads have all
enjoyed a spring afternoon at the park.

Now the park'has a new feature — a me-
morial garden built in honor of Volpe, who
drowned beneath the park’s dam on April 23,
2006.

“I had the idea to do something when Mr.
Volpe and Mrs. Volpe said they never wanted
Charles to be forgotten,” Dylan Fitzgerald, a
Rockbridge County High freshman, said.

Fitzgerald erected the garden as part of his
Eagle Scout project.

Fitzgerald moved a bench inscribed with
Volpe’s name and one of his favorite sayings
to a spot that over looks the dam. He also
planted a birch tree and will add more plants
when spring comes.

The saying seems to capture the way Volpe

   
  
 
 
  
   
 
   
  
  
 
   
  
  
  
  
  
   
 
  
   
  
  
    
  
 
  
   
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
  
 
   
 
 
   
  
 
   
  
 

   
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
   
   
  
 
   
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
  
  
 
   

 

What is legal.

Alum reﬂects on his time advising
Bush about terror war is legal limits

By John Henderson
STAFF WRITER

Jack Goldsmith, W&L Class of 1984,
spent ten months as assistant attorney gener-
al, giving legal counsel to the White House on
issues from counterterrorism to Guantanamo
Bay in 2003 and 2004. When asked wheth-
er he would do it again, Goldsmith said, “I
might ﬂip a coin.” He spoke at Washington
and Lee last Monday on his experiences.

Goldsmith graduated summa cum laude
from W&L in 1984, earned B.A. and M.A.
degrees at Oxford and later attended’ Yale
Law School. In 2003, while working for
the Defense Department, Goldsmith was
called to the White House for an interview
with Alberto Gonzales, the President Bush’s
legal counselor. Weeks later, Goldsmith was
sworn in as the assistant attorney general.

As head of the Oﬂice of Legal Counsel,

dent have been restricted by criminal laws,
meaning that a violation of those laws is
punishable with a prison sentence. Bush
and his cabinet needed to know just how far
they could go in the “War on Terror” without
breaking the law.

Goldsmith was in the uncomfortable posi-
tion of telling the president (through Gonza-
les) what he could and could not do. When
the Bush administration pushed against the
law, Goldsmith had to push back.

Towards the end of his term, Goldsmith
was exhausted and fed up with the secrecy
and unilateral decision-making within the
White House. The Bush administration was
making decisions without expert advice,
Goldsmith said. He believes that the Presi-
dent should have been working more closely
with Congress. Instead, Bush took the “go-
it-alone approach” and thereby lost a lot of
trust.

“The central irony is, the agenda to expand presidential

power will end up weakening the presidency in the foresee-

able future. ”

Jack Goldsmith, former Asslstant Attorney General and 1984 alum
 

Goldsmith determined whether certain exec-
utive actions were lawful. In his ﬁrst eight
weeks he was briefed on various counterter-
rorism operations for which the president
would need approval. In time, Goldsmith
came to the conclusion that the opinions of
his predecessors, in support of these actions,
were “deeply ﬂawed.”

“It began to dawn on me that I could
not. .. stand by or reaﬁirm these opinions” he
writes in his book, “The Terror Presidency.”

Goldsmith spoke in Lee Chapel on Mon-
day to an audience of students, professors
and local residents. He argued that the pres-
idency is torn between two fears — fear of

attack and fear of the law. After September ,

11, Goldsmith explained, the White House
tried everything possible to prevent another
terrorist attack. There was the sense that a
second attack would be blamed on the presi-
dent. “They pushed against the law, feeling
that they had to go right to the line,” Gold-
smith said.

At the same time, there was the fear of
pushing too hard and crossing the line.
Since the 1970s, the war powers of the presi-

“The central irony is, the agenda to ex-
pand presidential power will end up weaken-
ing the presidency in the foreseeable future,”
Goldsmith said.

Politics Professor Rob Strong agreed with
Goldsmith’s analysis, and added, “We’re go-
ing to be living with this kind of threat for
a very long time.” It will be up to ﬁiture
presidents, he said, to balance civil liberties
with the need to address threats.

After the talk, a reception was held in
the Alumni House. Goldsmith chatted with
members of the audience and elaborated on
his earlier points. Several members of the
audience waited to have their copies of “The
Terror Presidency” signed. Attendants felt
like they were standing in the presence of a
dignitary. K

But Goldsmith is just an ordinary man
who has experienced an extraordinary career.
He now teaches law at Harvard University,
which is a welcome change after the arduous
schedule that kept him away from his wife
and sons. “It was a painful experience” he
said, but he was grateful to have learned so
much from it. ‘

US. must reach out

Expert on Islam says peace won ’t come unless dialogue improves

By Joel Poelhuis
STAFF WRITER

Ambassador Akbar Ahmed, rec-
ognized by the BBC as “the world’s
leading authority on contemporary
Islam,” spoke at W&L last Wednes-
day night in Lee Chapel. In a speech
ﬁlled with hope but grounded in se-
rious realism, Ahmed told attending
students, professors and area resi-
dents that building bridges between
the Islamic world and the United
States is essential to global welfare
in the 21st century. Ahmed’s speech
served as the third event in an ongo-
ing Middle East series sponsored by
W&L student organization Contact.

Ahmed revealed that the U.S. is
perceived by Muslims as conduct-
ing an active attack on Islam. These
tensions fuel a rising anti-American
sentiment and give credence to ex-
tremists. The solution to the conﬂict,
according to Ahmed, is a three-part
process in which the West must take
the lead. The cost of not taking action
could drain U.S. resources in expen-
sive foreign wars while destroying
the chance for development in Islam-
ic countries. This situation, Ahmed
claims, would prevent the US from
focusing on other world priorities
where its leadership is badly needed.

The ﬁrst step is to do away with
a retaliatory mindset and instead, ad-
dressing the underlying causes of the
conﬂict. America’s current “war on
terror” has a blinding effect, which
Ahmed warns could be counterpro-

ductive to its long term goals. Us-
ing Pakistan as an example, Ahmed
showed how US. foreign policy has
shifted from promoting democracy to
forging short-term military alliances
for strategic value. These alliances,
claims Ahmed, are not as beneﬁcial
to development of U.S.-Muslim rela-
tions because they are heavily contin-
gent on U.S. military aid and may not
have the overall support of the popu-
lace. Foreign aid sent to governments
of this type often turns up in military
form, which destabilizes rather than
develops a region.

Dialogue is Ahmed’s second step
and one he is personally familiar
with. He consistently meets with
leaders in other faiths and works to
promote inter-faith discussion and is
a trustee of the World Faiths Develop-
ment Dialogue. Ahmed places great
importance on the status of Abraham
as the root of the Jewish, Christian,
and Muslim faiths and painted reli-
gion as a conduit which could lead
to greater cultural and political un-
derstanding. Symbolism is crucial
in Ahmed’s plan for dialogue. For
example, when President George W.
Bush visited a mosque shortly after
the attacks of 9/ I 1, the Muslim world
reacted positively. Ahmed said ac-
tions like this are important in build-
ing credibility for open dialogue.
Ahmed also desires greater maturity
in the Muslim world, especially the
ability to maintain composure when
faced with a different opinion. The
difficulty with this value, Ahmed

claims, is that “the majority of the
Muslim world is young, illiterate, and
unemployed,” a recipe for trouble in
any belief system.

This lack of education and op-
portunity is one of the problems that
lead to the ascendancy of Muslim lit-
eralists or fundamentalists over more
moderate modernists. Ahmed rec-
ommends direct funding of education
and infrastructure development as a
way to combat extremist views of the
U.S. This paves the way for dialogue
and opens the door to challenging ex-
tremist views with textual evidence
from the Quran.

The goal of these steps is friend-
ships between individuals in the
Islamic world and the U.S. When
personal friendships exist, political
differences will not disappear, but
will be dealt with in a more mutually
beneﬁcial way, according to Ahmed.

Neil Scheaffer, co-chair of Con-
tact, said the current series on the
Middle East has boosted attendance
of Contact events.

“We wanted to take a relevant top-
ic and approach it from a number of
different angles,” Scheaffer said.

Ahmed’s speech was co-sponsored
by the W&L Religion department,
which Scheaffer said helped create a
strong base of support for promotion
and attendance.

The next speaker in the Spotlight
on the Middle East series will be
General Anthony Zinni on March
6th speaking on “War in the Middle
East.”

QEP project update

The Quality Enhancement
Plan committee is moving for-
ward in its efforts to select one
idea that would improve life at
Washington and Lee. .

The project is part of W&L’s
re-accreditation efforts. Junior
Rich Cleary said the committee is
now seeking input on 11 ideas.

The top three ideas will even-
tually be presented to the provost,
and one idea will evenually be
implemented.

The ideas are as follows:

1. Freshmen seminar: This pro-
posal would expand the cur-
rent freshman seminars so
they could be open to all
freshmen. Another option
would use the seminar to help
freshmen with the transition

to college.

2. Student intellectual life: This
idea could enhance out—of-
classroom ideas to improve
intellectual life.

3. Academic life: Help implement
the newly approved academic
life plan, with a focus on de-
veloping innovative courses
for the 4-week spring term.

4. Service learning: Focus on
making connections between
academic objectives and real
world issues.

5. Sustainability: A focus on elim-
inating or offsetting W&L’s
climate-changing emissions.

6. I Program: Students would
participate in one of three
“I”s: Independent research,
international study, or an eight

week internship.

7. Information ﬂuency: Focus on
helping faculty and students
use technology to ﬁnd data
and conduct research. Also
encourage students to share
research they have complet-
ed.

8. International education: This
plan envisions using winter
and spring terms to encour-
age language students to take
intensive classes and study
abroad. .

9. Advising: Clarify the mission .

Comedian gets a laugh wherever he goes

Mary Washington student Watt Smith tries to break through, build his career

By Carson Haddow
snrr warren

Watt Smith is another one of
those funny guys. The brother of
a current W&L senior, Watt was
invited to perform a stand up
comedy routine in the Stackhouse
Theater on Tuesday. To give an
idea of Watt’s general atmosphere
it would do well to consider his
simpleton philosophy: “If I took
it too serious, I would cry after
every show.” Kind of a live life as
it comes mentality — oh and try to
laugh as much as possible.

Watt was born in Richmond
and is now at Mary Washington
University in Fredericksburg, at
least when he’s not on a semi-pro-
fessional joke tour in D.C. or Vir-
ginia. He started telling jokes for
fun and publicly in high school,

lived his life: “Live to love, love
to live, no regrets.” —

The crowning touch of the gar-
den is a piece of limestone that
Fitzgerald and Volpe’s parents
moved from the family’s prop-
erty.

Workers at Hamric Memorials,
donated their time and carved the
same saying onto the stone.

Though Fitzgerald and Volpe
are a few years apart in age, the
two became friends at the 10-
cal skate park. Chuck Volpe,
Charles’s father, said his son
looked out for younger kids at the
park.

"‘It turned out [Charles] liked
to help the younger kids,” Volpe
said. “So I had a lot of these
younger boys that were 12 years
old come up to me after Charles’s
death and say, ‘your son was re-
ally nice to us.’”

Fitzgerald is not the only local
teenager working to keep Volpe’s
legacy alive. Cassie Benson and
Ben.Goldsmith, two former class-
mates of Volpe, have been work-
ing with Chuck Volpe to raise
awareness about the dangers of
dams.

The Jordan’s Point dam is a

of a boom,” said the Basics Group
report. And although Nucor took a
loss during the third quarter, it beat
expectations, leading to a 4.1% rise
in stock.

The group also decided to sell
Kaydon, what they say is the weak-
est stock in their portfolio. Kaydon
manufactures bearings, split-roll
bearings, ﬁltration products, linear
deceleration products and perfor-
mance seals. The machinery indus-
try has been hit hard by the slow
housing market, and the weak dol-
lar also affected the performance of
the company, and it’s unknown how
long it will take for the stock to re-
cover.

of the aforementioned industry group and
should not be used as the basis for indi-
vidual acquisitions. Always consult your

ments carry risk. Past results are not nec-
essarily indicative of future performance.

won a joke contest and the ca-
reer was launched. He does plan
to ﬁnish college, at least to make
the parents happy, but then, of
course, he’s on to bigger and bet-
ter things. Watt seems to envision
a life in L.A., moving around get-
ting comedy gigs like a musician.
He says it is tough to ﬁnd work
and pay: “It’s hard to make it as a
comedian,” especially early in the
game. He maintains however that
all he needs is enough for some
food and a place to live. He will
work hard, but he will certainly
have a blast doing what he loves,
Watt, or Walter really, just re-
ally likes making people laugh. It
is always a relief, he says, when
the fear of that awkward, post-
funny silence is evaporated by
the giggles and grins of an at least

“low-head” dam. While these
dams often look unimposing, they
create deadly hydraulic effects.
As water comes over the darn it
re-circulates back to the base of
the dam, trapping anything that
has gone over the dam.

Benson and Goldsmith said
they were shocked to hear that
Charles, who was an expert swim-
mer, had drowned.

“We were really surprised to
hear it because of how comfort-
able he was around the water.”

The two teenagers, along with
Chuck Volpe, worked with Del.
Ben Cline (R-Lexington) to get a
new dam safety law passed in the
Virginia state legislature.

The law urges dam owners to
put signs up warning swimmers
and boaters not to approach the
dam. Owners who put up signs
limit their liability to $25,000
if someone is injured or killed.
Owners who don’t put up signs
risk having to pay much larger
settlements in a lawsuit.

Volpe ﬁled a lawsuit against
the city in September, claiming
that the city was negligent because
it failed to put up signs warning
swimmers of the dangers around
the dam. He is seeking $3.3 mil-
lion in damages.

' The city did put up no trespass-

somewhat attentive audience.

He always tells new jokes; he
writes them before each routine.
It seems like too much work and
stress going into such a funda-
mentally carefree and amusing
pastime. He’s spent nights on end
of working in D.C., standing in
front of people and desperately
bidding for their attention. Watt
takes it easy and just lives life. He
does not really need to “save the
world with laughter,” but rather
he wants simply “to have fun be-
ing funny.”

His comedic technique is to
honestly setup an idea or scene,
and then shock people by giving a
surprising twist in the punch line.
He makes people see a different
viewpoint, and makes them laugh
at it and sometimes their selves.

were no signs in place on the day
Volpe died.

In fact, the city didn’t even
know it owned the dam. Only af-
ter Volpe’s death did city ofﬁcials
discover they had acquired the
dam nearly 70 years ago.

Chuck Volpe initially wanted
to see the dam demolished, but
other local residents didn’t want
to lose the ﬂat stretch of river cre-
ated by the dam.

Now Volpe and City Plarmer
Bill Blatter are discussing an op-
tion that could remove the dam’s
dangers while still preserving the
ﬂat water that boaters and swim-
mers currently enjoy.

Volpe’s plan calls for two dams
to be built upstream of the current
dam, while the current dam would
be partially removed.

The result, Volpe hopes, would
be Class II rapids that boaters
could safely paddle through.

In a way, Volpe hopes his cam-
paign to raise awareness about
these dams will serve as a penna-
nent memorial to his son.

But he’s glad that F itzgerald’s
garden will keep the memory of
his son alive at Jordan’s Point.

For my last article of this year,
I thought of writing an uplifting,
engaging article, that reminded
us all of the blessings we have
and the purpose of the holiday
season. This article will probably
not be doing any of that.

A few days ago, I was talk-
ing to campus favorite Burr Datz
when I was forced into a paralyz-
ing silence. For those of you who
know me, you all realize what a
great feat this must have been.

What I saw that silenced me
were a pair of khaki pants in the
bookstore window. However,
these pants were no ordinary
slacks, they had blue and white
tridents ALL over. I would guess-
timate that there were at least 30
tridents.

When I ﬁst saw the pants,
I thought that the trident de-
cals were actually sharks. Why
sharks? Well, I assumed that the
pants were Vineyard Vines and
just following the same mold as
the women’s slacks that have ev-
erything from whales and ﬁsh to
palm trees and pineapples.

Just the other day, I saw some-
one wearing shorts that had a
whale and skull and crossbones
pattern. I did not realize that
skulls and whales were the next
dynamic duo. Maybe they were
trying to do a pirate/sea-faring
creature theme? I’m not sure what
was going on but it disturbed me
and shook up my soul up to the
point where I was saying “Ay,
matey.”

I personally do not believe in
having tropical seascapes, insects
or fruit on my clothing. I battled
that decision, but after some soul

 

Abortion: a balancing act  

editor

State shouldn ’t force moral judgments on everyone

This is in reply to Chris Tu-
tor’s article “Rudy’s Problem”
from the Nov. 12 issue of the

‘Ring-Tum Phi. I take Giuliani’s

position to be internally consis-
tent, and here’s why.

As Tutor correctly points out,
there are important rights that
society should protect, and mem-
bers of society should not be left
to choose for themselves whether
to respect these rights or not. In
the United States, there is a shared
value framework to which we can
appeal in negotiating our differ-
ences and identifying the rights
that should be entitled to legal
protection.

An important value we share
is that we should not use the coer-
cive power of the state to enforce
our sectarian views. Suppose,
for example, that my faith for-
bids me to consume intoxicating
substances (such as coffee and
alcohol). Since I live in a society
containing a plurality of religious,
moral and philosophical systems,
I recognize that my reasons for
abstaining are not shared, and
I cannot justiﬁably expect the
state to enforce abstinence for
everyone based on my religious
reasons. The claims of others to
conduct their lives in harmony
with their sectarian value systems
is as strong as my claim to adhere
to my own.

But all reasonable moral sys-
tems in society seem to overlap

searching I’ve just decided that
I don’t support attire that either
makes me hungry, swat at myself
or want to go on a vacation.

After seeing those pants in the
display window, I decided to fur-
ther dissect some of the fashion
on campus. I enjoy nothing more
than fun and funky patterns and
colors on clothes, but sometimes
people make terrible life choices
concerning clothes.

If it is cloudy, drizzling and 40
degrees outside, you should not
wear shorts with a tee, have on
sandals, or be wearing colors so
bright that your reﬂection causes
vision loss.

You know what I’m talking
about. If it looks like a skittle bag
exploded all over your clothes or
when describing the color that
you are wearing, you have to
put the word “neon” in front of
the name, you may want to wait

at certain points, and this over-
lap constitutes our shared value
framework. This common value
system recognizes certain basic
rights, such as the right to life and
security of the person, including
the right to bodily integrity (e.g.,
not to be killed, battered, raped
or tortured) and the right to lib-
erty (including the right not to be
unjustly imprisoned and not to be
enslaved). State coercive power is
used, justiﬁably, to protect these
rights.

Still, basic rights are not abso-
lute. Although all people are en-
titled to their lives and freedom,
there are circumstances under
which some people’s interests in
life or liberty must give way to
others’ corresponding interests.

For example, people can be
imprisoned for committing crimes
and killed under death penalty
statutes in some states.

In some states, such as Virgin-
ia, that society should express its
moral outrage by executing per-
sons convicted of capital crimes
is taken to justify the loss of in-
nocent life on the inevitable oc-
casions when people are wrongly
convicted.

One might disagree about
whether these particular qualiﬁ-
cations to basic rights are justi-
ﬁed, but few argue that no quali-
ﬁcations are justiﬁed. One who
supports an unqualiﬁed right to
life must oppose the death pen-

and wear that color in the spring
— the time of brightly colored
clothes.

Outside of brilliantly blinding
bold colors, the mixing of various
patterns plagues this campus like
a terrible biblical curse. Stripes,
polka dots, checks, etc. are great
to wear but not together. I’ve
seen people on campus put these
varied patterns together, and all it
does is make them look like the
product o_f a zebra and cheetah,
mixed with a candy cane.

Honestly, if someone may get
dizzy looking at all of the de-
signs on your clothes, that outﬁt
may not be the one. Please re-
member, friends don’t let friend
wear plaids with polka dots, just
DON’T do it!

What I ﬁnd interesting about
the fashion choices is that many
of the individuals wearing these
style are trying to be “individu—

alty, even use of deadly force in

self-defense (which would justify

a complete ban on handguns).
Should abortion be legal?

"That depends on which interest

is stronger: a woman’s interest in
autonomy or a fetus’s interest in
being born.

Should slavery be legal‘? That
depends on which interest is stron-
ger: a person’s interest in owning
other people and proﬁting from
their labor, or a person’s interest

People shouldn ’t be
left to choose for
themselves when to
respect others ’ba-

sic rights. What are
these basic rights that
should be protected?

Melina Bell, assistant
professor of philosophy

in liberty and self-govemment.
The slavery question is a very
easy one if we don’t think the ﬁrst
interest is a legitimate one at all.
But many people do not ﬁnd
the legal abortion question easy,
even if they believe the fetus is

als” and have their own style.
The problem occurs when 200 or
more people try to be “individu-
als.”

If everyone is wearing the
same stripped pants with a polka
dot polo, then you have went
from being “different” to “look-
ing like everyone else.” Thus
resulting in a homogenously dif-
ferent campus sense of fashion.
Only at W&L would rebellious
fashion consist of NOT wearing
ﬂorescent colored Polo or a ma-
dras printlskirt. Where I’m from
in western Tennessee, neither of
those options would be thought
kindly upon.

However, I must say that on
most days, the intricate attire and
attention-grabbing garb makes
me smile a big Kool-Aid grin
while chuckling deep in my soul.
I enjoy the efforts made by my
peers to be different while still

a person with full rights like you
or me. Many people who op-
pose legal abortion would make
an exception in cases of rape,
incest and/or when the pregnant
woman‘s life or health is at risk.
In these cases, the fetus is as fully
a person as in other cases.

So there must be a balancing
of important interests that we
value in common that is taking
place, rather than an insistence on
unqualiﬁed rights based on a sec-
tarian view.

Of course people shouldn’t
be left to choose for themselves
when to respect others’ basic
rights. The difﬁcult question is:
What are these basic rights that
should be protected?

Finding the answer requires
us, together as a society, to recog-
nize and evaluate important com-
peting claims and values, offering
each other reasons from within
our shared value system that we
can expect others to recognize.
This is how our shared value sys-
tem expands and develops.

As Giuliani acknowledges,
one value we share is that the co-
ercive power of the state is not to
be used to enforce sectarian moral
judgments but only rights and val-
ues established within our shared
value system.

Sincerely,
Melina Bell

° Friends don’t let friends dress badly

’re headed to vacation, you may be one of the homogenously different

playing it safe since everyone
else is dressed like them.

Tying this article into the holi-
day season, I suggest that if you
have any of the aforementioned
attire in your closet and do not
wear them, donate them to the
Union Mission, Goodwill or an-
other charity of your choice.

Lastly, I implore some of the
W&L student to mix up their
fashion a little and try new things
with next season"s style. I have
no desire to see 50 million people
with the same polo and khaki out-
ﬁt for all of Winter Term or the
same wool dress and pashmina
scarf.

As you do your holiday shop-

No college male in his right mind would hang posters of anyone from Maxim is unsexiest women on their dorm wall

By Kathie Scott
surr WRITER

How would you like to open
up an issue of Maxim to ﬁnd your
name listed as one of the unsexi-
est people in the world? Oh, to be
a celebrity.

Maxim published its very of-
ﬁcial list of the ﬁve unsexiest
females in the world, as follows
(with unsexiest listed at the top):

1. Sarah Jessica Parker
2 Amy Winehouse

3 Sandra Oh

4. Madonna

5 Britney Spears

Now let’s discuss the logic be-
hind this list. Sarah Jessica Parker
is apparently the unsexiest female
in the world. This seems so ironic
because Sarah Jessica Parker is
most commonly referred to as
Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and
the City. Because of this, I ques-
tioned Maxirn’s decision to place

poor Sarah at the top of their list.

But then I thought about it and

ﬁgured out a way to determine if
she is really all that unsexy. Pic-
ture a college male’s dorm room.
Can anyone imagine a poster of
Sarah Jessica Parker hanging
above the bed? Exactly.

So Sarah really isn’t very
sexy. Does she deserve to top the
list? That is arguable. But let’s
continue.

Amy Winehouse. Done. There
really is no explanation neces-
sary for her position on this list.
In case you hadn’t heard anything
about Amy Winehouse recently,
she’s insane. A “recovering” her-
oin and crack addict, Amy Wine-
house made her biggest splash
in celebrity gossip when she and
her husband appeared before the
press bruised and bloody.

Apparently Amy’s husband
saved her life. She was cutting
herself alongside of a call girl
when her husband came in to save
the day. A physical dispute began
that left Amy running out of her

hotel very bloody and bruised,
her husband not too far behind.

Don’t you just hate it when
that happens? I can’t imagine a
poster of Amy Winehouse in her
delicate condition on anyone’s
wall. I personally think she de-
serves the number one spot as
unsexiest female. But maybe
there’s something Maxim knows
that I don’t.

Coming in at number three is
Sandra Oh. The infamous Cris-
tina from the ABC show “Grey’s
Anatomy.” You either love her or
hate her direct and emotionally
detached manner. But either way,
I don’t think she ‘gets many hits
on Google for sexy pictures.

Granted, nowadays every-
body has a sex tape somewhere
or a stack of sordid pictures from
early on in his/her career. None-
theless, Sandra is not a person
I would use to deﬁne sexy. Her
role on “Grey’s Anatomy” may
or may not have pushed her un-

sexy image, but I just think she’s
unattractive.

Number four on Maxim’s list
is Madonna. This is another entry
I don’t quite understand. Madon-
na. deﬁned sexy for a generation
or two when she ﬁrst started her

Madonna has progres-
sively become unsexy
over time. But, hey,

isn ’t that just aging?
 

music career.

Don’t get me wrong, her very
muscular look does make her
look even older than she already
is. She’s never really ﬁxed that
gap between her teeth, though
maybe some ﬁnd it becoming.

Madonna is also a huge diva

(in the bad way). I mean, for one
television broadcast of the Em-
mys, Madonna refused to appear
if she didn’t open although Mari-
ah Carey was the most logical
choice for opener at the time.

And really she has progres-
sively become unsexy over time.
But hey, isn’t that just aging? Is
that really fair? Sandra Oh is just
inherently unsexy. But Madonna
brought sex to music. I don’t like
Madonna very much but I’m not
sure she belongs in this list.

Our last unsexy female is the
Princess of Pop, Britney Spears.
This is another person I will ar-
gue. -

Britney is a mother. She’s not
as toned as she once was. Yes,
she shaved her head. But come
on! Not only did Britney top sexy
charts at one point, but this girl
was really really sexy.

And the true test is that one of
the more popular posters in col-
lege dorms is the enlarged ver-

sion of her on the cover of Roll-
ing Stone magazine. Now we can
all agree that she’s not the same
girl from her boy short underwear
days. And her fall has been quite
significant. But even in her cur-
rent state, I will always remem-
bcr Britney as a sex symbol for
our generation.

And because of that not too
distant memory, I feel Britney
should be removed from the list.
Isn’t it enough that she was stupid
enough to marry Keven Federline
without a prenuptial agreement?
C an‘t we just let her become un-
sexy in peace without calling her
out on it?

All in all, Maxim did a pretty
good job of coming up with an
interesting and somewhat ac-
curate list of unsexy females. I
could argue a case for some of
the placeholders but I’m not ap-
palled by the choices. Good job
Maxim! I’ll be waiting for the list
of unsexiest males.

Busy week for ball

Team starts 0-2 in

The women’s basketball team had a busy week, playing
three games. They went 1-2 facing three tough opponents,
Mary Baldwin, Randolph-Macon and Virginia Wesleyan, a
combined 10-1 coming into the games.

The team started the week Tuesday night against Mary
Baldwin Squirrels. W&L started slow, going down 0-9. At
one point in the ﬁrst half, the deﬁcit was 14. It was look-
ing bleak for the Generals who had yet to post their ﬁrst
win. After a run by W&L to end the ﬁrst, the Generals had
cut the difference to two at half time. The second half was
close and intense. The half featured 11 lead changes and 8
. ‘ ties. With 71 seconds remaining in the game, the score was
tied 59-59. The tie was broken by a lay-up by senior guard
Kristin Krouchick who led the Generals with a season-high
21 points and 9 boards. She added a free throw to make it
62-59, the ﬁnal score. W&L had their ﬁrst victory of the
season. Other Generals also provided strong performances.
Sophomore center Kaitlin Kamp had one of her best games,
tallying a career-high tying 15 points and a season high 7
rebounds. Senior Amanda Kane also scored in double dig-
its. It was an exciting win for the Generals, giving Mary
Baldwin their ﬁrst loss of the season.

Friday, the Generals faced the 22”“ ranked Yellow Jack-
ets of Randol h-Macon. The Yellow Jackets came out
Dr° Sheryl H‘ C3-rls ﬁring from thepbeginning. They shot 55 percent from the
28 Bones Place Lexington, VA 540-463-2715 ﬁeld in the ﬁrst and took an 18-point lead twice in the ﬁrst

' half. They looked like a nationally ranked team. The score

Q was 40-26 coming into half time. After half, the Generals

security issues, committing 22 turnovers in the defeat. Also,
they allowed the Yellow Jackets to get 4 players in double
ﬁgures and shoot over 50 percent. There were some bright
for the Generals, however. Junior guard Bethany Riden-
hour had a season high 16 points and four steals. Freshman
guard Allie Long had a career-high 11.

Saturday, the Generals took on the Virginia Wesleyan
Marlins. The Generals started off strong, building up a sev-
en-point lead with 5:55 to play in the ﬁrst. After this point,
the Generals went cold, and the Marlins went on a massive
run. The Marlins scored 33 of the next 35 points. By the
end of the rtm the score was 50-26. The Generals were able
to chip away at the lead some, but it was not enough. The
game ended in a 17-point victory for the Marlins, 61-44.
This run was the obvious difference in the game. The Gen-
erals controlled the beginning and the end of the game but
just couldn’t stop the bleeding in the middle. W&L again
had turnover problems, committing 20. The team was lead
by Kristin Krouchick’s 15 points with 6 boards. Senior
guard Emily Wolff had 9 points and 6 rebounds

The Generals return to action Tuesday in a 7:00 away
contest against Hollins. .

The Washington and Lee wrestling team traveled to Grantham, Pa., to
take part in the Messiah-Petrofes Invitational this weekend. After two tough
days of wrestling, an undermanned Generals team managed to place 11th out
of 13 teams with just ten wrestlers, compared to 23 for champion Heidelberg
and featured several strong individual efforts. .

“The team did far better than last year,” said junior John Christopher.
“However, everyone still has a good amount of work to do in order to have a
successful dual meet season.”

The Generals were led by Christopher’s third place ﬁnish in the 197-lbs
weight class. Christopher was seeded third started out strong downing Corey
Proscia in the opening round and followed up with a 4-0 decision against
sixth-seeded Mike DiOrico of Oneonta. However, his run through the cham-
pionship bracket was derailed when he was beaten by second-seeded Tyler
Schmidt of Johns Hopkins in the semiﬁnals. However, Christopher rebound-
ed by running the tables in the consolation bracket. He defeated Proscia for
the second time in the tournament and then bested Bill Sholly of Muhlenberg
by a 6-1 decision to claim third place, the highest of any General.

“I feel like I did a solid job but could have done better,” said Christopher
of his performance. “I realized a several things I need to work on and have a
month now to iron them out.” i

The biggest surprise of the tournament for W&L came from senior Kirk
Adamson in the 184-lbs. weight class. Adamson was unseeded but knocked
off sixth-seeded Ed Bizorik of Heidelberg 6-4 in his opening match. He fol-
lowed up with an even bigger upset, defeating third-seeded Matt Horn from
Muhlenberg with a 4-2 decision. That was as far as he would get, Second-
seeded Eric Fishel of Johns Hopkins knocked him into the consolation brack-
et where he lost to Bizorik 3-0 and then to Horn in the 5th place match.

Senior Peter Lawrence provided the only other top eight ﬁnish for the Gen-
erals, wrestling in the 149-lbs. weight class. Lawrence defeated Brockport’s
Pat Fallot in a 12-6 decision and then crushed Evan Kidwell form Messiah .
by a 20-7 major decision. Lawrence came up short against ﬁrst-seeded and
eventual champion Paul LeBlanc from SUNY Cortland. He bounced back by
overpowering Heidelberg’s Frank Dudzik by a 14-3 major decision before
falling to ﬁfth-seeded Zach Mizer of Heidelberg 8-1 and then seventh-seeded
Sean Dreger of Mount Union in the seventh-place match.

The Generals had several other wrestlers record wins though they did
not place. Seniors David Shubeck, Tim Manson, and Anthony Boniello won
two matchs each. Junior Rob Terrin and sophomore Jonathan Brown tallied
a win.

“The Messiah Tournament was a very good gauge of how the team is
doing so far and consisted of both in-conference and non-conference op-

Three Generals
run at nationals;
Telfeyan places

Three of Washington and Lee’s fastest runners
spent their ﬁrst weekend of Thanksgiving break not
gorging themselves on home cooked meals or long
nights of sleep but running in cold Minnesota at the
NCAA Division III Cross Country Championships.
In Northﬁeld, Minnesota, on a freezing morning and
a light dusting of snow on the ground, Junior Mi-
chael Welsh, Junior Becca Taylor, and Sophomore
Kat Telfeyan competed with the top runners in the
country in Division III.

His first time running at Nationals, Welsh ﬁnished
in a time of 26: 10 to place 164th out of 280 runners.
Welsh is a junior and has higher goals for next year.

“I deﬁnitely want to be back at nationals next
year, ideally with some other guys on the team,” said
Welsh. “This year was all about learning how it feels
to race with the big boys. Next year, I’d like to be

opponents Waynesburg, Gettysburg and host Washington and Jefferson.

one of them.”

Meanwhile, Taylor and Telfeyan sported strong
runs in the women’s race. Taylor crossed the ﬁnish
line in 23:56 to claim 235th place out 245 runners.
Telfeyan took l03rd after completing the course in
23:00.

“Nationals was a great experience this year,” com-
mented Telfeyan. “Being in that kind of environment
really encouraged me to run hard. It got me excited
for track and next year’s cross country.”

“The team is only getting better and I think we
will surprise everyone next year,” shared an excited
Telfeyan. V

Three months after the season ofﬁcially began,
the cross country teams have put their shoes away,
though most have now only exchanged them for
track spikes.

STAFF WRITER

The Washington & Lee men’s
basketball team ended its 30
year losing streak to Randolph-
Macon College by beating them
in overtime as the Generals went
2-! this past week.

1 The Generals lost to the Yel-
low Jackets by one point in their
ﬁnal matchup last year when
now senior captain Greg Biene-
mann missed two free throws
down the stretch. This year, Bi-
enemann got his redemption - he
hit a layup with 1.3 seconds re-

maining in overtime to seal the '

victory.

“What a great feeling— to be
a senior and beat [Randolph-
Macon] for the ﬁrst time in 30
years,” said Bienemann. “Hit-
ting the game-winning shot was
awesome. [I’m] just glad I could
be there for my teammates.”

W&L won the opening tip
and Bienemann scored on a la-
yup, which set the tempo en
route to a 33-point game, tying
his career high. Randolph-Ma-
con immediately responded with
a layup and a subsequent 7-0 run.
However, Bienemann thwarted
the run when he hit a layup on a
pass from fellow senior captain
Femi Kusimo.

The game went back and
forth until Bienemann sparked
the team with 11:45 left in the
ﬁrst half by sinking a shot while
being fouled. This propelled
W&L to a 25-15 lead just two
minutes later and the team ended
the half up by 12, 40-28.

Bienemann opened up the
second half the same as the ﬁrst
by converting a layup on a feed
by junior Chris McHugh. Again,
the Yellow Jackets answered
with a 5-0 run, cutting the lead
to nine. This time, junior captain
Isaiah Goodman ended the run
as he hit a baseline jump shot.
Randolph—Macon responded by
scoring the next three points.

W&L then went on an 8-0
run of its own. Sophomore Ben
Goetsch and junior Kirk Jones
made back-to-back three-point-
ers and Bienemann added in two.
The score was 52-36, the Gener-
als’ largest lead of the game.

Both teams then traded bas-
kets when a relentless Randolph-
Macon team went on a 17-0 run
to re-take the lead with under
four minutes to play; this was
the Jackets’ ﬁrst lead since the
ﬁrst few minutes of the game.
Bienemann once again ended
the run and hit two crucial foul
shots to make the score 61-60.

Later, in the last two minutes
of the game, McHugh hit a three
despite a defender in his face
to give W&L a two point lead.
Randolph-Macon, undeterred,
went right down the court and
knotted the game at 67-67 with
one minute to play. Neither

team was able to score again in
regulation and the game went to
overtime.

The Yellow Jackets opened
the scoring in overtime on a fast
break that led to an easy two
points. Kusimo countered with
a jump shot at the foul line, to
deadlock the score at 69-69.
Randolph—Macon scored the
next four points, but Bienemann
responded with the next four
points. With 1:36 left to play, the
Yellow Jackets knocked down
two foul shots. McHugh was
fouled on W&L’s next posses-
sion and matched Macon’s two
foul shots.

With the shot clock turned off
at the end of the game, McHugh
drove past his defender from the
top of the arc, but was blocked
on the shot attempt. Bienemann,
who was in the right spot the
whole game, grabbed the loose
ball and banked in a shot with
1.3 seconds remaining to win
the game. ‘

Goodman said the win was
a testament to how the program
has progressed over the past few
years.

“It meant a lot to our team
to end that winning streak,”

said Goodman. “We have gone
through so much together as a
team, and to be able to say that
we’re the team that ended that
losing streak shows how much
we have grown. Two years ago,
we may have lost that game in
regulation. Last year, we might
have lost in OT. But this year,
we pulled it out with a lot of
great plays - we got stops when
we had to have them and ﬁn-
ished buckets when we needed
them. Our next task is to start
the W&L winning streak over
Randolph Macon.”

W& Lee defeated Dickinson
College at home earlier in the
week in the team’s ﬁrst home
game. The Generals started out
fast, building a 22-6 lead in the
opening 10 minutes of the game;

.they hit 12 of their ﬁrst 15 shots.

W&L improved its lead and
went into halftime up by 20, the
score was 35-15.

Dickinson would not relent in
the second half and cut the lead
to 12 with just under 12 minutes
to play. However, W&L did not
let up and increased its advan-
tage to as high as 24 points (70-
46). The ﬁnal score was 70-52.

Sweet swims for men at

The Washington and Lee
men’s swimming team is pick-
ing up the pace as the quality
of their opponents rises. From
Thursday through Saturday the
teams traveled to Gambier, to
participate in the Nike Invita-
tional at the Kenyon Athletic
Center Natatorium for the Nike
Cup, against their stiffest com-
petition all year.

“Some of us just wanted
to swim lifetime bests, some
wanted to make national cuts,
and others are recovering from
injuries and just want to see
where they are so far this year,”
said senior Alex Sweet. “We
had a lot of great swims and
are looking forward to our next
chance to compete.”

The men ﬁnished with 296
points, good for sixth out of
seven teams and just 15 points
behind Davidson.

On Thursday evening, the
Generals got off to a strong start
when their 800 free relay team
of juniors Paul Crook, Chris

Diebold and Brett Tatman, and
Sweet took ﬁfth place with a
time of 6:51.56, good enough
for a provisional cut.

“As always there is a high
sense of pride and team when
we are on deck, whether it be
at a duel meet, conference, na-
tionals, or the Nike cup,” said
Tatman. “People tend to take
their swims very seriously at
this mid-season meet because
we have rested and (some of us)
shaved, although that’s not to
say we’re not joking around to-
gether. I think we all swim bet-
ter when we are having fun on
deck, some teams tense up and
stress too much at big meets, but
I think that’s one advantage our
team has. When the atmosphere
is fun and you can joke around
with your entire team (coaches
included), you are going to be
less stressed about your swims
and swim much faster.”

The Generals were led by
Sweet’s multiple automatic
qualifying times on the sec-
ond and third days of compe-
tition. In the prelims for the

50 free, Sweet broke the pool
and W&L record, touching the
wall in 20.55. In the ﬁnals, he
broke his new record by record-
ing a 20.43, which automati-
cally qualiﬁes him for nation-
als. Sweet also placed third in
the 200 free with a time good
enough for a provisional cut.

“The atmosphere is certain-
ly more intense with all of the
great competition,” said Sweet.
“But we have already had a
very close meet with Carnegie
Mellon, which helped us to pre-
pare for Kenyon.”

Other day two highlights in-
cluded Crook placing eighth in
the 200 free with aprovisional
cut time of 1:42.40 and senior
Tim McGlaston placing ﬁfth in
the 50 free with another provi-
sion cut time of 20.90. Sweet
and McGlaston teamed with
Tatrnan and sophomore Bran-
don Bamds to take fourth in the
200 free relay with another pro-
visional cut.

“We are also on the bubble
in the 800 and 200 free relays,”
said Sweet. “Ideally we would

season high of 24 points on 10
of 15 shooting from the ﬁeld.
Goodman and Jones were also
in double ﬁgures, scoring 11 and
10 points respectively.

Goodman attributed the win
to execution and good defense.

“We played great defense and
held their leading scorers below
their averages,” said Goodman.
“We took care of the ball and
picked their zone apart.”

The Generals were not as
effective against ﬁfth-ranked
Virginia Wesleyan on Sunday.
Bienemann got the Generals
off to a quick start scoring on
the ﬁrst possession but Virginia
Wesleyan’s outside shooting
overwhelmed the Generals from
the start. The Generals trailed
37-26 at halftime and, despite
a few sparks could never mount
a serious threat to the Marlin’s
lead, falling 68-53.

W&L now has a 2-4 overall
record and is 1-1 record in the
ODAC.

Bienemann said the team has
lofty goals this year.

“The team’s goal this year is
to win an ODAC championship
and go to the NCAA touma—
merit.”

Kenyon

like to get the A cuts in these
events at conference and settle
the issue for sure.”

Day three saw Sweet leading
the way again, this time in the
100 free. He broke his school
record in the preliminaries with
a time of 45.15 and then reset
the record again in the ﬁnals,
placing second in a time of
45.04, his second individual au-
tomatic cut of the meet.

In the ﬁnal event of the
meet, Sweet, McGlaston,
Bamds, and Crook teamed up
for the 400 free relay. Though
they broke the pool record set
last year by W&L’s relay of
Sweet, McGlaston, alumnae
David Croushore and Michael
Ginder, they placed third be-
hind Penn’s and Johns Hopkins’
relays. However, they did beat
rival Kenyon by just three hun-
dredths of a second.

After training in Florida
over Christmas break, the Gen-
erals will host Marymount and
last year’s Bluegrass Mountain
Conference runner-up Wingate
on Jan. 12 at 1p.m.
