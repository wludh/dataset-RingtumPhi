Thirteen sophomores who planned
to join Kappa Sigma last year have
now taken residence in Gaines Hall,
far from their now-empty fraternity
house in Davidson Park.

Kappa Sigma fraternity (Mu Chap-
ter) had its charter revoked by Kappa
Sigma National on July 13, 2007.
This decision came after investiga-

. tion of two separate hazing incidents,
one occurring in 2004 and another
earlier this year. It will no longer be
a recognized fraternity at Washington
and Lee University for the 2007-2008
academic year, according to a press
release from Director of Campus Ac-
tivities, Jason Rodocker.

Former President of Kappa Sigma
George Hunter said, “We cared about
Mu Chapter. That was always what
was most important to us. It will al-
ways be what is most important to us.
It is a shame that we cannot carry on
with the backing of Kappa Sigma.”

. When allegations of hazing viola-
tions surfaced in Feb. 2007, Kappa
Sigma had already been placed on
probation, or trusteeship, for similar
violations committed earlier in 2004.

“Mu Chapter had not worked their
way off trusteeship, and members
knew that Kappa Sigma National
and W&L both have zero tolerance
policies on hazing, including speciﬁc
written explanations of what is haz-
ing,” Rodocker said.

In 2004, allegations of hazing vio-
lations were reported directly to Na-
tionals. At that time, Nationals con-

. ducted an investigation and found that
the alleged violations were indeed
committed and placed Mu Chapter on
probation.

In 2007, the new charges were
heard and deliberated upon by the
lnterfratemity Council (IFC), an orga-
nization which is composed entirely
of W&L fraternity men. After deter-
mining that Mu Chapter had violated
rules against a speciﬁc type of haz-
ing, members of the IFC assigned the

“We never found out the relationship to our chapter

of the person who made the allegations or the alle-
gations themselves. We heard them through the IF C,

like a game of telephone. ’

GEORGE HUNTER, former Kappa Sigma president

penalty of critical probation. W&L’s
Student Affairs Committee (SAC),
composed of half student leaders
and half faculty and staff, echoed
the IFC’s decision.

While Hunter admitted that the
chapter had been guilty of hazing,
he argued that signiﬁcant discrepan-
cies surfaced during the IFC trial.

“We did not haze in a man-
ner that was absolutely consistent
with the questions that were being
asked,” he said. “We never found
out the relationship to our chapter of
the person who made the allegations
or the allegations themselves. We
heard them through the IFC, like a
game of telephone.”

After critical probation was as-
signed, Kappa Sigma National de-
cided to conduct its own investiga-
tion. Rodocker said, “During that
process, W&L ofﬁcials consistently
urged Kappa Sigma National not to
suspend Mu Chapter’s charter and
that the critical probation penalty
imposed by the IFC was sufficient.”

However, Nationals proceeded
under its own authority and visited
Mu Chapter for a formal investiga-
tion in May consisting of a member-
ship review.

“We were unequivocally open
with the university and with Nation-
als about the process, the details
of the hazing and exactly what the
hazing consisted of,” Hunter said.
“However, they required as part of
their membership review not only
information about the hazing, which
we proffered in ﬁlll, but exactly

which brothers took part in the haz-
ing.”

Because Nationals viewed
the chapter’s response during the
membership review as uncoop-
erative, the chapter was asked to
attend a hearing with the Kappa
Sigma National Supreme Execu-
tive Committee this summer. Sev-
eral Mu Chapter members attended
the conference, which was held in
Miami, Fla.

At the conference, Nationals
decided to revoke Mu Chapter’s
charter on grounds of hazing vio-
lations, lack of cooperation during
formal investigation and member-
ship review and existing probation-
ary status.

In retrospect, Hunter said he
believes he and his brothers made
the right choice in taking the pun-
ishment as a house. He said, “It
was mistakes we had all made. I
thought it was strong of all of us to
not better our own positions at the
expense of anyone else.”

Nationals and W&L want to
bring Kappa Sigma back but will
likely wait until all current mem-
bers have graduated, said Rodock-
er’s press release.

Matthew Bott, Kappa Sigma
National’s Assistant Executive Di-
rector, said, “We’ve been on cam-
pus there for over 100 years. We
know we’ll be successful when we
retum.”

Based on IFC trials from previ-
ous years, Womom believes that
the Greek system is moving in the

right direction.

Although losing Kappa Sigma
is certainly not positive for W&L,
Rodocker said valuable lessons, such
as developing a healthy relationship
with a Greek house’s Nationals and
revamping New Member Education
to be a positive experience, can be
drawn from this event.

He said, “The perception that
bonds of brotherhood are formed
through group suffering is incor-
rect. Several healthy methods exist
for developing brotherhood that is
pure and productive - hazing is not
one of them.”

Princeton Review
study labels W&L
as a party culture
lacking diversity

Bywes 0’DeIl
STAFF WRITER

The Princeton Review (TPR), a New
York-based test preparation company, re-
cently released its latest round of college
rankings in its annual publication, “The Best
366 Colleges”.

In it, TPR surveys about 325 college stu-
dents at each of the 366 campuses and asks
them about their college experience in terms
of academics, social life and student body.

The results are then used to rank these in-
stitutions in 62 separate categories.

This year, W&L ranked ﬁrst in the cat-
egory “lots of hard liquor,” second in both
“little race/class interaction” and “major
frat/srat scene,” fourth in both “homoge-
neous student population,” and “lots of
beer,” and ninth in “altemative lifestyle not
an altemative” (measuring acceptance of the
gay community).

Several members of faculty and adminis-
tration ﬁnd fault with this methodology.

“The Princeton Review thrives on cari-
cature,” said University President Kenneth
Ruscio.

“It proﬁles institutions based on selective
or incomplete or inaccurate data. As a result,
some features of campus and academic life
at particular colleges—not just Washing-
ton and Lee-—get exaggerated or placed in
a context that aligns only roughly with the
more complex reality.”

Associate Dean of Students Tammy
Futrell called TPR’s methodology “ﬂawed”
and said that W&L had “suffered some un-

fair ratings at its hands, and our diversity rat-
ing is no different.”

She pointed to the success of Black
Greek Letter Organizations and increased
multicultural student enrollment and reten-
tion as clear evidence of progress.

The negative stereotype these rankings
breed is a plague to the Admissions Ofﬁce.

As far back as 2004, the oﬂice published
a scathing brochure calling TPR “disreputa-
ble and commercially driven” and attacking
its methodology as “so suspect that it ren-
ders [survey results] meaningless.”

According to Associate Dean of Admis-
sions Jonathan Webster, “little is said about
the high-quality programs and academics we
have, and we’re made out to be some sort
of anti-intellectual caricature of ourselves.
It certainly doesn’t help us in recruiting stu-
dents. . .I admit I sometimes wonder how
prospective employers and graduate school
admission ofﬁcers regard us and our alumni
on seeing that sort of stuff in print.”

rankings claiming them “to be representative
of the W&L experience.”

When asked how TPR affects the admissions
process, Kelly replied “No comment. Our mis-
sion is to simply and unabashedly provide infor-
mation [the prospective student] won’t get from
the W&L brochure and the W&L website.”

She defended the survey’s methodology while
admitting it is a “self-selecting opinion poll.” A
valid, unique W&L e-mail address is required to
complete the W&L survey and the respondent
must reply to a validation email at the end of the
process. This prevents one or two students from

D repeatedly voting and skewing the results.

Similarly, she pointed to the satisfaction_ of
students themselves as evidence that the process
is fair. At the end of every survey, students are
given a chance to rate the previous year’s pro-
ﬁle of their college; “nationally, 81% rate them
‘very’ or ‘extremely accurate’,” she said.

Kelly said TPR is a “big fan of W&L,” and
it wants to provide an accurate snapshot of cam-
pus culture to help prospective students decide if
it’s “the right ﬁt.”

Student Recruitment Committee tour guide
Dane Boston said he often faces questions from
those prospectives based on TPR’s rankings.
He reminds them that college guidebooks are
designed to make money and that alcohol is a
problem on all college campuses. His best coun-
ter: “spend time on campus and talk to real stu-
dents,” he tells them.

Nonetheless, Boston does see an element of
truth in the rankings—he points to a lack of so-
cio-economic diversity and a “divisive” Greek
system as real problems confronting the com-
munity. Rather than shy away from these “deep
ﬂaws,” he simply tries to “communicate my
hope that new generations of students will ad-
dress the ﬂaws while beneﬁting from the many
things we do right as an institution.”

Similarly, President Ruscio expressed conﬁ-
dence in the ability of the university community
to “make our own judgments of our strengths
and weaknesses.”

TPR’s Kelly would agree.

“Let us know if we’ve got it right or wrong,”
she said, urging more students to participate at
survey.review.com.

$100 million dollar man

Donor of the recent gift revealed at convocatio

By Jacob Gelger and
Mlchael Keenan
MANAGING EDITOR AND
SPORTS REPORTER

When Washington and

Lee University President
Ken Ruscio took ofﬁce in
July 2006, one of his ﬁrst
priorities was to visit Ru-
pert Johnson, Jr.

That visit, coupled with
Johnson’s interest in help-
ing his alma mater address
one of its strategic goals,
led to a $100 million dona-
tion that Ruscio announced
last spring at graduation.

“I went out and spoke
with [Johnson] early in July
last year, right after I came
on,” Ruscio said. “The ﬁrst
thing he said was that he
wanted to do something
that was a priority for the
university.”

Worried that the an-
nouncement would over-
shadow the Class of 2007’s
accomplishments, Johnson
choose to remain anony-
mous until last Wednesday,
when Ruscio announced
the new scholarship plan at
Convocation. ‘

Dennis Cross, W&L’s
Vice President for Uni-
versity Advancement said
Johnson also wants to
avoid the national media
spotlight.

“He always thought that

announce his name to the
W&L community,” Cross
said.

Johnson, who graduated
from W&L in 1962, is the
Vice Chairman of Franklin

Templeton Investments.
His father started the group
in 1947.

Forbes Magazine esti-
mated Johnson’s net worth
at $4.6 billion, and he is
listed as the world’s 172
richest person in the maga-
zine’s 2007 rankings.

Johnson did not return
two calls requesting com-
ment.

Cross said Johnson had
been a generous and active
donor in the past.

“It was clear that [John-
son] was very interested
in student scholarship and
making sure the best stu-
dents could attend W&L
regardless of cost,” Cross
said.

The new program will
certainly enhance that goal.
$85 million will go directly
toward need-based grants.

Ruscio said the new
program, when fully imple-
mented, will increase the
need-based aid budget by
25 percent. The Class of
2012 will have 44 John-
son scholars, with a similar
number entering each.year.
Half of the students will
hold merit scholarships

VV 8514 THeaTeR

similar to the old George
Washington scholarship
program, and half will hold
new need-based grants.

Dean of Admissions
William Hartog canceled
an interview to discuss the
program, and other mem-
bers of the admissions of-
ﬁce were either out of town
or did not respond to re-
quests for comment.

Cross said the gift will
be paid to the university
over the next four years. 5

But Johnson’s gift goes
beyond simply paying stu-‘
dents’ tuition. The remain-
ing $15 million will create
two new professorships,
establish a lecture series
and symposium and gives
rising seniors the opportu-
nity to pursue leadership
development

“Ken outlined in pow-
erful terms the need for
professorships and sympo-
siums,” Cross said.

One of the new profes-
sors will teach in the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences,
studying how individuals
and ideas can shape his-
tory. The second professor
will teach in the Williams
School, focusing on leader-
ship and entrepreneurship.

Ruscio has a history of
studying and teaching lead-
ership. Before becoming
W&L’s 26”‘ President, he

served as Dean of the Uni-

son School of Leadership.

As Ruscio pointed out
at Convocation on Wednes-
day, university presidents
have spent more and more
time in recent years deal-
ing with fundraising and
alumni relations.

“A lot of my job is talk-
ing to alumni and support-
ers of the university, but it’s
not always talking about a
donation,” Ruscio said.
“It’s about their connec-
tions to the university.”

Johnson’s $100 million
gift certainly helps W&L
address one of the major
priorities of its new stra-
tegic plan, Ruscio said the
school still has about $600
million worth of spending
built into its plan for the
next 10 years.

Asked what he would
do if another donor offered
up $100 million, Ruscio
said the gift could go to a
number of places.

‘‘I’d want to find out
what in the strategic plan
is meaningful to that [do-
nor],” Ruscio said. “Maybe
it’s the Colonnade, maybe
the replacement for Du-
Pont Hall, or maybe it’s
more money for improving
faculty salaries. We try to
match the donor’s interest
with the plan.”

Greeks need to fight problems as one

We ’re only shooting ourselves in the foot. Instead of always fighting each other: band together

By Cody Beauchamp
co LU M NIST

Schadenfreude — n. A mali-
cious satisfaction obtained from
the misfortune of others.

Over the summer, Kappa Sig
had its charter revoked. Dur-
ing orientation week, Phi Psi”s
Fallout, was busted and shut
down. Just this weekend, I had to
sneak back to campus in a mass
of people because Lexington po-
lice managed to scare the Pikas at
Aquavelva into shutting down.

Since all fraternities compete to
throw the best parties and impress
the same rushees, I get a distinct
feeling of schadenfreude every
time I see another house’s parties
get shut down. I secretly~-heck,
openly—smile whenever I hear
a freshman swear they’ll “never
go back to that house; they get
busted.”

Really though, why should I
celebrate?

All Greeks like to entertain the
notion that our houses are unique,
that what troubles one house
won’t affect all ofus.

We couldn’t be more naive.

Would it help frat A’s rush if
competing frat B has their parties
continually shut down? Of course
it would. But are frat A’s long-

area community has made no se-
cret about how much they hate the
Greek system, ergo a majority of
W&L students.

The city and county have con-
tinually honed laws and ordinanc-
es towards ever more effective
forms of student discrimination.

Last year the county seriously
considered cracking down on
country parties because of com-
plaints from local residents who
had moved near party homes.
These houses had become infa-
mous for loud parties long before
their neighbors moved in. What
did these people expect - study
sessions at Downfall?

The implicit threat of an or-
dinance being put on the books
still lingers for the country. Some
neighbors! They moved to where
we are and we’re in trouble.

Go down to the police sta-
tion to obtain an ampliﬁed sound
pennit. as I did with a fraternity
brother last week.

If you walk in and introduce
yourself as the president of the
local gun club, explain you’re
having a club BBQ, and ask for a
permit, you’ll get it without much
hassle.

Introduce yourself as the So-
cial ('hair of a fraternity and
you’ll suddenly be required to

(We know that We’re essential-
ly denying you a basic permit, but
sorry Mr. Fratman, you haven’t
jumped through this especially re-
served hoop yet!)

The anti—Greek sentiment is
ridiculous. Our frats and srats
give hundreds, even thousands, of
hours of community service each
year. They also represent most of
the student body, a student body
that adds intelligence and talent to
the community.

W&L is the reason, obviously,
over a hundred of brilliant profes-
sors live in Lexington, again add-
ing to the quality of life.

If nothing else, the Greek
houses pump tens of thousands of
dollars into the local economy.

But nobody seems to care.

The community simply sees
us as a bunch of spoiled rich kids
looking to get drunk; never mind
the blood-drives, the charity 5Ks
or the carnivals for kids.

Never mind the millions of
dollars pumped into the local
economy because of the school,
an entity made up of nearly 80%
Greek students. Even the exces-
sively large police force gets to
justify size by citing us.

Unfortunately, the administra-
tion and their proxy—or should
I say pawn?—the IFC don’t do

es is both unfair and enough to
terrify the most stalwart deans.

The IFC though, as the very
students discriminated against,
has no excuse for its passiveness.

If the members really are rep-
resentative of the fraternities,
they should be protesting them-
selves sick every day about how
unequally the frats and srats are
treated.

Are there possibly underaged
kids drinking at these parties?
Sure. But can the police magically
bend the rules of due process/sus-
picion just because people are vis-
ibly young? No.

The IFC should be advancing
that protest like it’s their job. Be-
cause—are you listening gentle-
men?——it is. That’s what advo-
cates do.

Greeks at W&L have to start
standing up for each other. Collec-
tively we have to start demanding
that the community, law enforce-
ment, and other authorities treat
us without prejudice. If a city or-
dinance made it more diﬂicult for
black people to assemble peace-
fully, do you think it would pass
without protest? No.

Why then do we stand by idly
when We’re discriminated against
for being students or in a frat or
srat? Schadenfreude may be fun

Rankings don ’t matter

High schoolers are ravenous for information about
their prospective colleges. Cheery pamphlets sent from
admission ofﬁces are well and good, but they fail to
convey the truth of student life. The annual Princeton
Review says it tries to provide a true picture of W&L
life to prospective students.

We’re ranked No. 1 for lots of hard liquor, No. 7 for
lots of beer and No. 2 for having a major Greek scene.
True, the admissions office does not advertise that side
of the school, but that’s also because these are opin-
ions.

The review admits is doesn’t use scientiﬁc methods.
It surveys hundreds of students to rank the schools rath-
er than using hard data.

Every year the administration makes it a point to
mention Princeton Review because they know students
and parents have seen the rankings.

But why do they bother?

If people rely solely on Princeton Review, do we re-
ally care? Any student worth admitting will do his re-
search or visit the campus. Parents who are concerned
should also do their research and not just read one re-
view.

Princeton Review panders to concerned parents. Do

The selection of a vice presi-
dent with appeal to key demo-
graphics, ideologies and regions
will be incredibly important to
the Republican party. With such
an ideologically diverse group of
presidential aspirants for 2008,
each contender would likely want
different things in their running
mate. The following vice presi-
dential candidates all have their
own strengths.

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike
Huckabee

With his strong performances
in the recent Iowa Republican
straw poll and the past several dc-

tion to the ticket of a moderate
like Giuliani or McCain, espe-
cially Considering the fact that
Huckabee could help to fortify
the South against the encroaching
Democratic gains in the region.

Arizona Sen. John McCain

Some would question whether
this veteran senator and former
frontrunner would consider the
position described by former Vice
President Garner as “not worth a
pitcher of warm piss”.

McCain would likely ﬁnd the
offer to continue his long service
to our nation hard to resist. With
the other candidates’ recent com-
pliments paid to McCain, they

This conservative Midwest-
emer has long been considered
a possible Presidential or Vice
Presidential selection. Pawlenty’s
national visibility has been elevat-
ed considerably by his leadership
during the recent Minneapolis
bridge collapse and the fact that
the 2008 Republican National
Convention will be held in the
Twin Cities.

His region of the Midwest has
become increasingly important
to the Republican electoral math,
and his presence on the ticket
could help win his blue state’s
10 electoral votes as well as keep
Iowa and Indiana red. However,
Pawlenty’s early and vocal sup-

is often viewed as a northern big-
govemment moderate. Sanford
could make a mark if he endorsed
the eventual winner of the South
Carolina primary and the nomina-
tion. However, Sanford’s limited
national exposure and lack of true
signature accomplishments limits
his viability.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry

While Perry’s connection to the
legacy of President Bush makes
a national run unlikely in this
cycle, Perry continues to receive
mentions as a possible candidate.
With a staunchly conservative re-
cord over his seven years in Tex-
as’ executive branch, Perry could

applicants these days. A report from Princeton Review
is hardly going to scare all of those talented applicants
away.

If they’re smart enough to be admitted (and doesn’t
admission say that each class is smarter than the one
before?), then they’re smart enough to get a balanced
view of W&L.

W&L students have always had a reputation for «

playing hard and working hard. The formula has always
worked before, so why is admissions and the adminis-
tration so detennined to change it?

W&L ﬁghts to change

elitist reputation

The class of 201 I reﬂects continuous struggle‘
for greater ethnic and economic diversity

By Queenle Wong
smrr wmren

Every year the admissions office at Wash-
ington and Lee University works hard to di-
versify a predominately white student body.

“We want to create a well—rounded fresh-
men class and to do that we have to bring
students from many different backgrounds
together,” said Erica Reisbeck, the assistant
director of admissions.

Yet despite increasing efforts to recruit
more multicultural students to thiscampus,
the university still remains far from diverse.

In the latest issue of U.S. News and World
Report’s “America’s Best Colleges,” the
university, ranked against other liberal arts
colleges, received low marks for economic
diversity as well as ethnic diversity.

Washington and Lee ranked last in eco-
nomic diversity with 4 percent of the under-
graduate population receiving Pell grants, a
federal grant for low-income students. In ad-
dition, the school received a score of 0. l 9 out
of 1.0 on the publication’s diversity index,
which only factored in the number of Ameri-
can minorities: a shocking ﬁnd for a school
that was ranked 15 overall.

For years, the university has worked to
increase the number of students with diverse
backgrounds. In 2002, the board of trustees
adopted “A Statement of Commitment to
Diversity,” which stated that the university
would not only work to create a more diverse
student body, but a diverse faculty and ad-
ministration as well. “Just as a vibrant liberal
arts education in the classroom challenges
attitudes, beliefs and accepted ways of think-
ing, the interaction outside the classroom
of individuals with different perspectives
strengthens our educational enterprise,” it
stated.

Reisbeck pointed to the advancements
in technology as one of the tools that has
helped push the university’s diversity efforts
forward. Five out of eight employees at the
admissions office will also travel intemation-
ally, going anywhere from ﬁfteen to thirty
different foreign countries in the fall, she
said.

“From all the liberal arts colleges, 1 decid-
ed to attend Washington and Lee University
because of its unique academic and social
environment,” said Vasil Vulkov, a freshman
from Bulgaria.

A presentation that was delivered in his
high school attracted him to the university as
well, he said.

Although Reisbeck admitted that other
variables such as race and ethnicity are used
in the admissions process, she wouldn’t clas-
sify it as affirmative action. Academically,
each applicant is judged equally, but in any
competitive admissions process, the univer-
sity must base admission on what the student
will bring to the campus environment. There-
fore, two students with the same SAT score
and GPA are eventually separated based on
other criteria like race, legacy, geography, or
talent, Reisbeck said.

This year 22 international students and 54
American minority students enrolled out of a
total of 463 freshmen. However, these num-
bers did not include the 11 dual citizens that
are also attending Washington and Lee.

For the most part, there have not been any
signiﬁcant changes in the university’s eth-
nic diversity during the last ﬁve years, but
Reisbeck said that new efforts to increase
socio-economic diversity are currently tak-
ing place.

“In college, we hope to make an impact
on students and diversity is one way to do
that.” A

Hinely shares musical art

W&L photographer combines two passions

By Sarah Kientz
STAFF WRITER

University photographer Pat-
rick Hinely is rarely seen, yet
his work is all over campus.
He ﬁlls the university calendar,
magazines and website with
photographs of students, alumni,
athletes, events and locations
around campus.

In his exhibit “Jazz People,”
featured this month in the Sta-
nier Gallery, Hinely steps out
from behind his camera to dis-
play photographs much different
from his typical full-color shots
of campus. Hinely takes the op-
portunity to show off his love
of both jazz music and raw ﬁlm
photography.

The exhibit is in anticipation
of Hinely’s newly published
work, a 52-page hybrid book,
calendar and diary called the
“Jazzperezzo 2008 Jazz Calendi-

ary.”

Hinely has been taking pic-
tures of musicians since he grad-
uated from Washington and Lee
in 1973.

“It’s gotten amazingly and
wonderfully out of hand since
then,” Hinely said.

Hinely followed some of his

  

favorite bands as they traveled,
taking photographs and offering
his prints to their record compa-
nies. As a result, Hinely’s work
has been featured on the inside
or the cover of almost 200 al-
bums as well as jazz magazines
from around the world.

“Jazz is a music that comes
from America but doesn’t thrive
here anymore,” Hinely said, ex-
plaining why his photographs
range from Lexington to Berlin
to Japan. “Music has taken me a
lot of places I wouldn’t have got-
ten to go otherwise.”

Just as Hinely continues to
shoot with a black and white
ﬁlm camera, the subjects of his
photographs have pursued a craft
often considered defunct.

“To me they’re heroes in a
way,” Hinely said. “They’re car-
rying on a tradition because they
love it so it’s worth it.”

Hinely explained how the
exhibit tries to show the over-
lap between beauty and truth, of
glamour and simplicity.

“Among all the media, these
pictures can present something
that might be beautiful but that is
certainly true,” Hinely said. “My
job is to ﬁnd them both.”

Though the pictures show

Bl'Ball The Banli.

some famous faces, they are all
presented in black and white, un-
ﬁnished and unframed, hanging
from the walls by paperclips.

“In the world of ﬁne art these
prints are wearing shorts instead
of tuxedos,” Hinely said.

He enjoyed the way an art
director from another univer-
sity noted that the exhibit was as
simple as sheet music hanging
on the walls.

Most of all, Hinely wants gal-
lery visitors to take away the idea
that “music doesn’t just create it-
self, there’s work involved, both
glamorous and unglamorous.”

Hinely wants to show the te-
nacity of the musician’s spirit,
something that he feels makes
them remarkable.

“I like what these people do
because they talk about freedom
of expression and inspire the po-
tential of human spirit,” Hinely
said. “They play like it might be
the last time they’ll ever play:
from the depth of their souls.”

“Jazz People” will be featured
in the Stanier Gallery from Sept.
3 through Oct. 10. Hinely will
give a short lecture on Friday,
Sept. 14 at 5:30 p.m., followed
by a reception featuring live mu-
sic in the gallery.

BHOTO COURTESY OF STACY DOORNBOS

Junlor Michael Welsh won the Washington and Lee Invitational in
a time of 28:39 to help the men's team secure first place.

XC off and running

Michael Welsh wins ﬁrst collegiate race on 21 st birthday
Men win team title, Telfeyan leds women to second place

By Kevin Corn
STAFF WRITER

The men’s and women’s cross coun-
try teams began their competitive sea-
sons with great runs at the Washington
and Lee Invitational. The men’s team
ﬁnished ﬁrst while the women’s team
claimed second place, with both compet-
ing against 13 other teams.

The men’s performances were high-
lighted by three ﬁnishers in the top ten of
124 runners. Junior Anthony Ives round-
ed out the top 10 with a time of 30:23,
junior Vance Berry took fourth with a
time of 29:26, and junior Michael Welsh
ﬁnished ﬁrst with a time of 28:39.

As a result, Welsh celebrated both his
ﬁrst collegiate win and his twenty-ﬁrst
birthday on the same day.

Thomas Brower, senior captain of the
men’s team, commented on Welsh’s win,
“I can’t think of a better birthday pres-
ent for Welsh than his ﬁrst collegiate vic-
tory.”

The women’s team ﬁnished well, es-
pecially with individual performances by
sophomores Kat Telfeyan and Dorothy
Todd. Telfeyan ﬁnished sixth with a time
of 25 :29, while Todd took ninth after ﬁn-
ishing in 25:39.

The performances on Saturday by our
cross country teams have set them up for
a strong year. Before the meet, the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference released
its 2007 preseason coaches poll which
named both of W&L’s teams as the fa-
vorites to win the ODAC championships
this year.

“We got the win despite holding out two of our top ﬁve run-

ners, which gives us a lot of conﬁdence moving forward The

the country in very warm conditions. ’

freshmen ran very well on one of the most diﬁicult courses in

}

TOM BROWER, Men's cross country captain

When asked about how the teams
have reacted to the results of this poll,
Brower remarked, “I don’t think the poll
itself places any pressure on us. Between
returning our top 12 runners and adding
eight new runners, we expect that we are
the team to beat. Our position in a poll
doesn’t change how much we want to
keep the ODAC title in Lexington for a
fourth consecutive year.”

Jessica. Buckingham, senior captain
of the women’s team, added, “While the
women’s team has won the ODAC for
the last three years, I think we are cer-
tainly capable of defending our title this
year. I am pleased and honored we have
been picked to win the conference title,
because it gives us something to work
toward throughout the season. Being
picked ﬁrst does not mean the title will
automatically be handed to us this year.
After placing second to Roanoke in the
invitational, we learned that this title is
going to be something we need to ﬁght
for. Being picked to win provides us with
this goal.”

So what do Saturday’s results mean
for the teams as they continue with the
rest of their season? Brower observed,

“We got the win despite holding out two
of our top ﬁve runners, which gives us
a lot of conﬁdence moving forward. The
freshmen ran very well on one of the
most difficult courses in the country in
very warm conditions, plus it was their
ﬁrst ever experience with 8000 meters.
It’s a lot to ask.”

For the ladies, Buckingham noted the
strength of Roanoke, “I think coming in
second place to the Roanoke girls will
motivate us to work even harder through-
out the season. Though I think we all
would have preferred to win our opening
invitational, this hopefully will serve as
a reminder to us all that Roanoke is go-
ing to be a dominant force in the ODAC
this year and that we are going to have to
work hard to beat them in the conference
championship!”

Overall, the teams are off to a strong
start and as senior captain Andrew Fris-
ki said, “Everyone went out and did
their best. No one could have asked for
more.”

After this fantastic start, the cross
country teams will return to action this
Saturday at the New York University In-
vitational.

For NFL,
upcoming

season provides

solace and
distraction
from off‘-season
issues

NFL looks towards upcoming

season to dispel image issues

By Amor Nelll Thurapl
COLU M msr

Aside from Thursday night’s opener featuring the Su-
per Bowl Champion Indianapolis Colts decimating the
New Orleans Saints, this past Sunday marked the begin-
ning of the 2007-2008 NFL season, arguably one of the
most important days of the year for sports fans. However,
this new season is unlike any other before it due to the
current state of the National Football League. Following
what can be described as the most tumultuous off-season
in league history, the NFL and its fans must look towards
this upcoming season as an escape from all the issues that
have plagued its players and personnel off the ﬁeld.

First and foremost, the past few months have seen the
ongoing saga of the Michael Vick scandal unfurl before
our very eyes. One of the best overall athletes ever to
grace a football ﬁeld now stands to face a minimum of
12 months in prison as a result of his involvement in an
illegal dog ﬁghting and gambling ring. As details of Vick
and his fellow defendant’s crimes surfaced, the ensuing
media frenzy surrounding the case produced daily from
page reports and round-the-clock coverage of Vick.’s ap-
pearances in court. At a time when NFL fans and sports
enthusiasts alike should have been getting excited at the
prospect of training camps opening up, signaling that the
NFL season was just around the comer, they were sub-
jected to constant reminders of the appalling behavior of
which one of the league’s most successful and marketable
players was a part. This dark cloud loomed large over the
NFL, and it appeared to provide the ﬁtting, ﬁnal chapter
to this year’s most disappointing off-season.

It is imperative to note that the Vick investigation and
indictment concluded an off-season in which second year
Commissioner Roger Goodell had already suspended
NFL players Adam “Pacman” Jones of the Tennessee Ti-
tans (for the entire season), Chris Henry of the Cincin-
nati Bengals (8 games), and Terry “Tank” Johnson of
the reigning NFC Champion Chicago Bears (8 games).
Each of the aforementioned athletes has had numerous,
and repeated, arrests with charges ranging from provid-
ing alcohol to minors, in Henry’s case, to Jones’ felony
and misdemeanor assault charges, and Johnson’s charges
of aggravated assault and possession of unlicensed weap-
ons.

Such reckless behavior by professional athletes brings
an unnecessary black eye to a league that is the highest
grossing professional sports organization in America. Not
since the tragedy surrounding former Carolina Panthers
wide receiver Rae Carruth’s role in the murder of his then
pregnant girlfriend in 1999 — an act for which Carruth is
currently serving an 18 year sentence — has the NFL had
to deal with such serious criminal offenses. Even the al-
legations surrounding Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray
Lewis’ involvement in a double homicide ended with
all felony charges being dismissed, thereby clearing his
name, despite the fact that many might contest that the
same cannot be said in the court of public opinion.

It appears that the NFL is in dire need to revamp its
image, and must do so in order to maintain its stronghold
as the most popular professional game in America. Unlike
in years past, there seem to be more and more players who
possess an overall lack of discipline, self-restraint, and
respect for authority. Such players only serve to further
mar the reputation of professional athletes and the league
itself.

That being said, I feel that this season presents the
NFL with the unique opportunity to restore its image
throughout the upcoming months. Fans of the NFL get to‘
witness a bona ﬁde superstar in Ladainian Tomlinson as
he continues to carve up opposing defenses while putting
up record breaking statistics. They also get to see capti-
vating rivalries such as another potential playoff matchup
between the New England Patriots and the Indianapolis
Colts for the third time in four years as Peyton Manning
tries to build a dynasty, while Patriots quarterback Tom
Brady attempts to start another one of his own. These sto-
rylines combined with the usual, yet unforeseen, drama
that unfolds over the course of the NFL season certainly
serve to ease the minds of football fans away from the
incidents that occurred this past off-season.

While the coverage of Michael Vick’s sentencing in
December will once again be in the news, and while there
will inevitably be certain disciplinary issues that Com-
missioner Goodell must face this season, it seems that for
the ﬁrst time since last February, the NFL will once again
be about the bone jarring hits, the underdog upsets, and
the beauty of the game itself, something that I think fans
all across the country are anxiously anticipating.

Defense stonewalls F&M

Pacicco rushes for 122 yards and a pair of touchdowns in victory

By Brian Devlne
STAFF warren

Washington and Lee football
games have sometimes been writ-
ten off as a joke, as a place to show
off that new sundress or bow tie
before leaving at halftime. In past
seasons, the team’s on-ﬁeld per-
formance has somewhat justiﬁed
this attitude with poor results and
unexciting play.

In 2006, however, the boys in
blue performed well above expec-
tations, winning ﬁve of six league
games, including clinching the
Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence title- and W&L football’s
ﬁrst postseason birth since 1951-
in front of a near-capacity crowd
on Parents’ Weekend.

Therefore, the trend of the si-
lent ﬁrst-half crowd was greatly
diminished, as loyal fans started
to stay the entire game and to
support the home side with chants
and noisemakers.

The 2007 season opener, a
sun-drenched affair Saturday af-
ternoon, proved too hot for the

large number of home fans that
left at halftime and for the visiting
Franklin and Marshall Diplomats,
who lost 20-0. The reduced crowd
support didn’t seem to bother the
Generals’ vaunted defense, . who
held the visitors to just three suc-
cessful third down conversions on
17 attempts.

Several defensive stalwarts
from last year’s postseason run
made their presence, including
the reigning Virginia Division
ll-Ill Defensive Player of the
Year, comerback Mark Snoddy.
Snoddy and fellow seniors Bry-
ant Fulk (5 tackles, 1 sack), Ryan
MacPhee and Kyle Luby held the
Diplomats to just 122 yards of to-
tal offense.

The visiting team was out-
played from beginning to end of
Saturday’s contest on both sides
of the ball.

Tailback Tom Paccico led the
way for the blue and white, rush-
ing 33 times for a career-high 116
yards and two of the Generals’
three touchdowns. Senior Jack
Martin, a pre-season All-America
selection at wide receiver, caught

nine passes for 177 yards and one
touchdown.

Perhaps worried about the
triple-edged ground threat of Pac-
cico, quarterback R..I. Vamer and
V-back Stuart Sitterson, Diplo-
mats coach John Troxell often left
only comerback Jeff Liberatore
to cover Martin, even in obvious
passing situations.

Vamer, a sophomore, took ad-
vantage of the mismatch to great
effect, often looking immediately
to Martin on pass plays because
of the single coverage. Vamer
ﬁnished the game with 250 yards
passing from 18 completions out
of 40 pass attempts.

The Generals dominated the
second half, making F&M punt
on seven of their eight drives, the
eighth ending only at the game’s
ﬁnal whistle. Dips’ quarterback
Kyle Turner, heckled all game by
the loyal home fans, was sacked
four times and completed only
seven passes for 59 yards.

The lone bright spot for the
visitors was the play of a few de-
fenders. Zach Romash recorded
eleven tackles and James Gregory

had ten. Defensive end George
Farrell had nine tackles and
forced a fumble, and safety Jeff
Kellar picked off two of Varner’s
passes.

All in all it was a resounding
victory on Hall of Fame week-
end, and even Dips coach Troxell
acknowledged the talent on the
W&L team.

“We played a team this after-
noon that is ready to compete on a
national level,” Troxell remarked
to the F &M athletics website.

If the Generals’ defense con-
tinues to stiﬂe opponents and
Martin remains a big-play threat,
then the 2007 season could be as
successful as 2006.

The Generals were picked to
ﬁnish second in the preseason
ODAC coaches’ poll, which
points to a crucial showdown-
again on Parents’ Weekend- with
top—ranked Bridgewater.

As with last season, perhaps
fans will begin to realize that
Generals football is worth watch-
ing and cheering for, and perhaps
their support will once again in-
spire the team to the postseason.

Volleyball opens season by winning two of four as hosts oft e W&L Invitational

By Michael Keenan
sponrs ronon

The Generals began their drive
for a seventh consecutive ODAC
title this weekend by hosting the
Washington and Lee Invitation-
al. While most volleyball teams
opened their season a week ago,
W&L’s had to wait until this
weekend because NCAA restric-
tions prevent teams from compet-
ing until classes have started.

“It’s pretty big,” said Coach
Snyder of opening against teams
that had already played their ﬁrst
games. “It’s not an excuse but it
is a factor.” 1

In the ﬁrst game of the tourna-
ment, the Generals took on South-
ern Virginia University, who en-
tered the match riding a seven
game win streak.

After dropping the ﬁrst game,
the Generals rallied to take the
second game and tie the match
a 1-1. After falling behind 26-22
in the third game, the Generals
“showed a lot of heart” in coming
back to win that game, said Sny-
der. Though they would lose the
fourth game, the Generals won
the ﬁfth game to win the match
24-30, 30-28, 30-28, 31-33, 15-
10, to preserve their undefeated
record against SVU.

were named to the All-Tournament team.

In the night cap, the Gener-
als took on Christopher Newport
University Captains. CNU en-
tered the match with a 1-5 record
after being swept by Southwest-
ern University earlier in the after-
noon. The Captains doubled their
win total for the year by sweeping
the Generals by a score of 30-26,

30-16, 30-14. With a number of

new players and some returners
in new positions, the Generals’
inexperience showed with ragged
play.

The Generals rebounded Satur-
day morning with a sweep of their
own against McDaniel, 30-23, 30-

23, 30-24. In the ﬁnal match of

the tournament, the Generals took
on Southwestern University. The
Generals dropped the ﬁrst two but
refused to give up. In game three,
the Generals took a 27-23 lead
and then gave up four straight
points to tie the game. But the
Generals regained their compo-
sure and won the game 30-27 to
avoid being swept. After keeping
it close through the fourth game,
Southwestern proved to be too
much and won the match 30-27,
30-24, 27-30, 30-24.
Southwestem’s win was their
fourth of the tournament, which

 
   

clinched the overall team trophy.
Southwestern was led by touma—

ment MVP Katy Lukaszewski -

and All-Toumament Team mem-
ber Marie Bruce. ‘

Joining the all-toumament
team for the Generals were junior
Laura Mauer and senior Jess Hu-
dock.

Overall, Snyder said he was
pleased with the team’s ﬁnish. He

was particularly impressed with-

freshmen Jenna Finger and Marah
Schmitz because they were asked
to play a lot and responded well in
their first collegiate matches.

Snyder believes the team has
the tools to put together another
successful season but still needs
to polish its skills, starting with
defense. Some of the raggedness
was a result of being out of posi-
tion defensively, which led to in-
decision on the court.

When asked about the team’s
chances to repeat as ODAC
champions, Snyder said the team
doesn’t view it as defending the
2006 title because nobody can
take that was but instead looks at
it as attacking the 2007 title.

“It’s a strong conference,” said
Snyder.

The Generals return to action
next Saturday when they take on
a strong Bridgewater team at 1 la.
m. and Gallaudet at 1 p.m.
