Prof’s lecture

attracts crowd

Scholar speaks on effects
of the South on hearts of
African-American writers

By John Henderson
STAFF WRITER

Professor Trudier Harris, this year’s Shan-
non-Clark guest lecturer, spoke last Thursday
to a packed house in Northen Auditorium.

As she began her presentation on her lat-
est book, “The Scary Mason—Dixon Line”, it
was clear that she did not need prepared jokes
to captivate her audience or a microphone to
make herself heard.

“There is this great, vast, brooding, welcom- ‘

ing and bloodstained land, beautiful enough to
massage and break the heart,” said Harris. With
these words she captured the subject of her lec-
ture, the American South, and the effect that it
has had on the hearts of black writers.

She made her case like a courtroom lawyer,
systematically and persuasively presenting the
knowledge attained from a lifetime of scholar-
ship.

Harris attended Stillman College inAlabama
and earned her Ph.D. at Ohio State University
in 1973. She taught at the College of William
and Mary until 1979 and went on to teach at the
University of North Carolina. She is now the J.
Carlyle Sitterson Professor of English at UNC.

In the ﬁeld of black literature, Harris is a
leading scholar.

She has written seven books on authors like
Toni Morrison and James Baldin, and she has
edited numerous anthologies.

She has seen black literature from Northern
and Southern perspectives.

But more impressive than her resume was
the complete ease with which she drew on the
literature, dissected it and made it accessible to
the audience.

Students and faculty were attentive as Har-
ris spoke of the fear that black writers have of
the South and their simultaneous attraction to
it.

She called the American South a “rite of
passage”—a terrifying, compelling subject to
be attacked and overcome.

She spoke rapidly and energetically as she
ranged over these themes.

After her 45-minute lecture, a reception was
attended by more than 120 audience members.

As professors and, students munched on
their cheese and crackers, they chatted in small
groups and waited for their chance to speak to
Harris.

Every reaction to her talk was enthusiastic.
French professor Mohamed Kamara described
it as “very exiting” and “amazing.”

Senior English major Dane Boston said, “I
thought it was very engaging and also very in-
sightful.”

President Ken Ruscio’s academic
proposal aimed at making Washing-
ton and Lee a national leader in liber-
al arts education has elicited diverse
responses from students and faculty.

The plan, if approved, would go
into effect at the beginning of the
2008-2009 academic year. Under the
new proposal, Spring Term would de-
crease from six weeks to four weeks,
and the graduation requirements
would drop from 38 to 36 courses.
Additionally, faculty would teach an
average of 5.5 courses per year, down
from six.

“It’s going to have a momentary
dramatic impact,” Ruscio said.

Compared with 24 of its peer insti-
tutions, W&L has the highest faculty
course load and the second highest
course graduation requirement. Rus-
cio said in order for W&L to establish
itself as a leader for liberal arts, these
constraints, along with the current
structure of Spring Term, need to be
modiﬁed. ‘

“I’ve been thinking about it al-
most from the moment I walked in
the door,” he said.

In decreasing the length of Spring

Term to four weeks, Ruscio said stu-
dents would take a single course that
is more focused and intensive instead
of two courses. When Ruscio came
into oﬁice a year ago, he said he did
not understand the current Spring
Term system. Now that he has a grasp
of it, he said he has little conﬁdence
that it will succeed.

“It would be irrespon-
sible ofme to waitfor
the chaos and pick up
the dead bodies. ”

KEN RUSCIO, W&L President

“It probably is only a matter of
time before it collapses on its own,”
he said. “If I’m really seeing that, it
would be irresponsible of me to wait
for the chaos and pick up the dead
bodies.”

In the past two weeks, Ruscio pre-
sented the proposal ﬁrst to the depart-
ment heads, then to the faculty and
ﬁnally to the Executive Committee,
comprised of students. ’

Though a general respect and ap-
preciation for the proposal’s inten-
tions seems universal, several faculty
members and students have expressed
doubts and concerns.

Junior Representative for the EC,
Rich Cleary, said he values the cur-
rent length of Spring Term, because
there is more time to develop rela-
tionships with professors.

“It’s the professor-student relation-
ships that has been one of the most
outstanding parts of my W&L expe-
rience,” he said. “One of my worries
is that [a shorter Spring Term] will
reduce and dilute and cheapen the
academic experience.”

Professor Kenneth Van Ness,
head of the Physics and Engineering
department, said the new plan will
affect his discipline, because there
are required major courses during
the spring. The proposal mandates a
four-week intensive course, but in the
Sciences, he said there is not a lot of
ﬂexibility.

“We still need to teach courses
for the major, or they’re not going
to learn what they need to learn,” he
said. “The six weeks is pushing it. I
don’t think you could compress itany

Mock Con gains momentum

Delegate fair sparks enthusiastic campus participation

By Allison Chopln
STAFF wrmsn

Students swarmed into Stem-
mons Plaza last Wednesday, greeted
by an overwhelming array of ban-
ners, chocolate chip cookies and loud
music. Student"-manned booths were
decorated with signs, and students
could peruse dozens of tables.

The Mock Convention Delegate
Fair was the last chance for students
to become participants in Washing-
ton and Lee’s Mock Convention for
2008.

Mock Con is held at W&L during
every presidential election year. Its
purpose is to predict the non-incum-
bent party’s presidential candidate.
Students participating in this year’s
convention will select the nominee
for the Democratic Party.

Oberlin" College in Ohio was the
ﬁrst college in the United States to

hold a presidential mock conven-
tion. The ﬁrst was held in 1860. Other
schools with similar conventions in-
clude Westminster in Pennsylania
and Loyola College in Maryland.
However, W&L’s Mock Con has been
praised by “Time”, “Newsweek”, the
U.S. Senate and others as being the
biggest and most accurate convention
of this type on college campuses. Out
of 23 predictions, the convention has
been correct 18 times. Recent years
have been extremely successful--only
one incorrect prediction has been
made since 1948.

The 2008 Mock Con will mark the
100"‘ anniversary of the ﬁrst conven-
tion, held in 1908.

The convention is a campus—wide
event. At Mock Con 2004, over 90
percent of the student body was in-
volved in some way. This year, the
numbers look even better.

“We are deﬁnitely well over 1500

students and looking to be on par with
the traditional 92 percent of students
involved,” said senior Tri-Chair Sara
Mueller.

“This is the last chance for
students to get involved with
Mock Con. We just want as
many students to participate

as possible. ”

KATE CHIASSON, Wlsconsln chalr
 

Wednesday’s Fair gave students an
opportunity to join the convention as
delegates. Senior Kate Chiasson, the
state chair for Wisconsin, explained
the importance of the fair.

“This is the last chance for stu-
dents to get involved with Mock Con.

We just want as many students to par-
ticipate as possible,” she said.

At any time between 10 a.m. and
4 p.m. on Wednesday, crowds of stu-
dents gathered around tables in the
plaza to join the delegation for their
favorite state.

The chairpersons for each state
had assembled enticing displays to
advertise their delegations, complete
with state ﬂags, music and posters
proclaiming state mottos, history
and interesting facts. For example,
Maine’s delegation sported the motto
“Maine-iacs,” and the accompanying
poster featured a peculiar state law:
after January 14 of the new year, citi-
zens can be charged with a ﬁne if they
have not taken down their Christmas
decorations. What better reason could
one need to join the state of Maine?

Many students chose to join the

delegations of their home
states, or they signed up with
friends or chose a state that
interested them. The more ad-
venturous would-be delegates
could also sign up for U.S.
territories, such as Guam, the
American Samoa and the Vir-
gin Islands. Students could also
join the Democrats Abroad if
they did not wish tojoin a state
or territory.

“I wanted to be part of a
more southern state,” said
freshman Katherine Gould.
She is from Kentucky and de-
cided to join Georgia.

A number of international
students chose to participate.
Freshman Wendy Shang, who
is from China, signed up as a
delegate for Texas.

“I will spend this Christmas
in Texas, and I hear that it is an
awesome state,” she said.

I unior Grace Andrews, who
was born in Ghana, Africa and
grew up in Tennessee, chose
to serve as the state chair for
Hawaii.

“I chose to represent Ha-
wail, because I knew that I
didn’t know much about their
political background. I saw be-
ing the state chair as a chance
to learn about the islands be-
sides what l‘ve always seen
on TV. while having fun,” she
said.

New delegates can ﬁnd
many ways to get involved
with their delegations. They
can take up positions such as
vice chair or treasurer, or they
can assist in designing a t-shirt
or lloat or performing research.
Students can also choose to
simply attend the convention
and cheer on their respective
delegations.

“They can be as involved
as they want to. It’s up to them
as to how they want to par-
ticipatc.” said junior Michael
Gretchen, the state chair for
Louisiana.

Junior Riley Barnes, the
chair for Texas, explained
some of the responsibilities of
being a chair.

Chairs are in charge of su-
pervising the delegation. One
ofthese tasks is conducting re-
search on the state or territory
so that accurate votes will be
cast. .

W&L’s Mock Con will be
Jan. 25-26, 2008. “I’m excited,
because it is something unique
to W&L,” Gould said.

Prof’s lecture

continued from page 1

Marc Conner, an English
professor who teaches Afri-
can-American literature, was
greatly impressed by Harris.

“The lecture was fantastic--
so much energy and then such
knowledge,” he said. “I mean,
she mentioned about 30 dif-
ferent writers in‘/45 minutes.
That‘s hard to do.”

Conner was responsible for
coordinating this ycar’s Shan-
non-Clark lecture and gave the
introductory remarks for Har-
ris.

When asked why she was
chosen to be the speaker, Con-
ner said, “Particularly since
this is the third year of the
African-American studies pro-
gram, and literature is a big
part of that, we really wanted
to bring an African-American
literary scholar.”

Conner also said, “She is
easily one ofthe top 10 [schol-
ars in black literature] in the
world, and I would say one of
the top five.”

Art professor Pamela Simp-

, son said she hopes she inspires

lecture attendees to read the
books she references.

However, she said Harris
far exceeded normal expecta-
tions.

“It‘s also just the intellec-
tual enterprise of encouraging
people to think about the world
and the environment they live
in." said Simpson.

Spring Term
continued from page 1

Journalism Department Head Brian
Richardson said his program runs into
problems when faced with the require-
ments of being a nationally accredited
program. The accreditation insists that
students take a certain number of credits
outside the major, and with less courses
now offered, it leaves little room for
ﬂexibility within the department.

“It is a squeeze,” he said. ‘‘It doesn’t
leave any room left to take electives in
our department.”

Spring Term has become known for
certain courses like the Archaeology
Department’s Dig. Archaeology Profes-
sor Laura Galke said the Dig has been
around since the 1970s. She said it might
now have to be offered in the fall.

“Compressing a full excavation...
into a four week term would be chal-
lenging,” Galke said.

Though the course may no longer
be offered in the Spring, Galke said the
department is committed to continuing
the program. She also said the shorter
Spring Term would still be a prime op-
portunity for studies in ﬁeldwork.

Other faculty view this abbreviated
term as an opportunity to be creative
with course offerings.

“Teaching can be really fun in this
regard,” said History department head
Ted DeLaney. “It’s a real privilege to
be able to totally immerse students in a
single course for four weeks -- that’s not
to say that creating such a course will be
easy for everyone.”

DeLaney said this term would lend
itself beautifully to something like an
oral history project. ,

“In a discipline like history, creating

- a four-week long couse takes a lot more

creativity and imagination,” he said.

Although it will not affect senior
EC Vice President Jordan Campbell, he
said he likes the proposal and Ruscio’s
motivation. The idea of a four-week in-
tensive class to enhance the liberal arts
education makes sense to him.

“That’s kind of what the heart of
Spring Term was originally supposed to
be about,” he said.

Ruscio plans to let the ideas sink in
during Fall term, and then he wants to
take a vote at the end of December.

“It’s going to have to be supported
by the faculty,” he said.

Richardson said he thinks faculty re-
sponse has been positive.

“As far as individual faculty go, I
sense a fair amount of broad support,”
he said. “Whatever we do now, we’re
going to leave it the hell alone for 10

years.”

Cleary said he hopes the proposal
will spark discussion within the entire
W&L community. He also said at the
moment, he does not think there is a full
awareness of the proposal within the
student body.

Ruscio stressed, however, that stu-
dent feedback is very valuable to him.

“What I hope this spurs is a real con-
versation about academic life,” he said.
“I would welcome those kinds of con-
versations with students.”

With this proposal, Ruscio said he
hopes to ﬁrst shape the local conver-
sation about liberal arts education and
then begin to affect the national conver-
sation. .

“That is the bread and butter of-liberal
arts teaching,” he said. “I am convinced
that we have all of the ingredients.”

By Kathie Scott
COLUMNIST ‘

You’re in the process of set-
ting up your fall schedule, but
there’s deﬁnitely one thing miss-
ing: your weekly dose of reality
and dramatic television.

That’s right, it’s time for the
fall television lineup.

This week, the ABC and NBC
networks will begin the premieres
of this fall’s new shows, as well
as some popular returning shows.
Now don’t get too excited. This
is your ofﬁcial disclaimer: I will
not guarantee that any of these
shows will be worth watching.

But sometimes it’s that train-
wreck TV show that just draws
you in. It’s ok! Everyone has a
guilty pleasure.

One season highlight is
NBC’s fourth season of “The
Biggest Loser.” This show airs
on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. as Days of
Our Lives star Alison Sweeney
guides 18 overweight contestants
through a competition to lose
weight.

The biggest loser implies the
person losing the most weight.
Clever, huh?

These contestants work out
on a consistent basis and are then
tested using cardiovascular activ-
ities. At the end of each test the

Powerful bombs, Cold War—like spying, and assassinations add up. for attempt to

it may not be a “Cold War”
but things are deﬁnitely chilly
between the United States and
Russia.

What was once a friendly rela-
tionship between President Bush
and Russian President Vladimir
Putin has warped into a tension-
ﬁlled stare down between former
foes and supposed allies.

Once again arms are a major
issue. While Americans were
pausing to reﬂect this past Sep-
tember 11”‘, the Russians intro-
duced the world to the “Father of
All Bombs.”

The bomb is meant to rival the
U.S.’s “Mother of All Bombs” as
the most powerful non-nuclear
bomb in the world.

According to the Russian De-

 

losing team eliminates someone;
the winning team is rewarded
with typical prizes, things like
letters from home.

Didn’t you know that limit-
ing contact with family mem-
bers creates a better atmosphere
for losing weight? Yeah, weird.
Well, I guess that’s why I’m not
a producer. I wouldn’t be able to
choose the correct type of bait.

However, this season there’s
a new twist! Maybe they’ll get
video phone calls from their fam-
ily members since we are in the
21*‘ century. So there’s a synop-
sis of “The Biggest Loser” in
case you’re like myself and have
never managed to see an episode
before. How did we live?

A new series that does show
some promise is “Joumeyman,”
airing at 10 p.m. on Mondays,
Main character Dan Vassar
changes the past for the better
when caught in a whirlwind of
time travel.

This may seem reminiscent
of the late 80s show “Quantum
Leap,” but don’t write it off just
because it’s a remake. After all,
the basis of American pop culture
and television entertainment is
the recycling of old ideas.

As a matter of fact, recycling
is a key ingredient for some of

fense Industry, the volume-deto-
nation bomb does not contradict
a single international treaty.

Some in the US are already
calling for the creation of a
“Grandfather of All Bombs”, po-
tentially leading to a non-nuclear
arms race.

The U.S. would probably not
be as wary of Russia having such
a powerful bomb if it were not for
the amount of spying that Russia
is taking part in.

National Intelligence Director
Mike McConnell remarked that
Russia and China have increased
their espionage activities in the
U.S. to “Cold War levels.”

“China and Russia’s foreign
intelligence services are among
the most aggressive in collecting
against sensitive and protected
U.S. systems, facilities and de-
velopment projects,” McConnell

the other shows premiering this
week on NBC. But recycling in
the 215‘ century has taken on a
new form. It’s called the “if we
come up with something good
let’s run with it until it dies”
theory.

The immense popularity of
“Law & Order” yielded to its
re-creation through newer ver-
sions such as “Criminal Intent.”
Entering its l7“‘ season, it’s obvi-
ous that though a great show, the
“run with it” theory has deﬁnitely
been applied. It makes you won-
der how many crime scenarios
they can come up with.

Don’t be fooled into think-
ing that the “run with it” theory
only applies to an original show
that provides good ratings, such
as “ER” and “Scrubs,” both of
which premiere Thursday start-
ing with “Scrubs” at 9:30 pm.
and “ER” following at 10 p.m.

tatives Judiciary Committee.

If arms and espionage
are not enough cause
for concern, how
about political assasi—

ation?

If amis and espionage are not
enough cause for concern, how
about political assassination?

President Putin’s government
has long been accused of being
involved in the death of Alexan-
der Litvinenko, a Russian dissi-
dent who was poisoned in Britain
in November 2006.

Honorable man

To the Editor:

Honor is not dead at W&L.

Last Saturday I lost my pocketknife somewhere between the parking garage and the Commons——not just any
old knife but my father’s own, given to me and of considerable sentimental value (yes, philosophers do have

sentiments l).

Monday I went to Agnes Gilmore at the Commons desk to inquire if it had been found and turned in. She
said “wait a minute, there’s something in the campus notices.”
Sure enough, someone had found a knife and taken the time to post a notice. So I emailed, and eventually
we found a time when he could bring it by my ofﬁce: the lost was found.
Now all of this may seem like a small matter (though the knife means much to me), but I wish there were
some way of taking note of such honesty-—routine here, perhaps. but unexpected in the wider world. The stu-
dent’s name is Bobby Ray Martin.

Cheers.

This theory also lends itself
to shows based on once popular
movies - “Friday Night Lights”
and the very popular show “The
Ofﬁce" will debut their ﬁrst
episodes of the season as well.
I guess the theory holds some
water. if people liked it the ﬁrst
time, surely a re-creation of the
original ﬁlm in different scenar-
ios should also prove successful.
I wouldn’t have thought sob but I
guess this is another reason why
I don’t produce shows.

Bottom line, NBC comes
through with a re-manipulation
of old shows, movies, and reality
TV, much like what every other
network is offering.

Not only has the Russian gov-
ernment impeded the investiga-
tion, but the man accused of plot-
ting the murder is now the head
of the Russian Nationalist Party
and running for parliament with
Putin’s approval.

This doesn’t even cover all the
disputes.

Add restrictions on the press,
a weakening democracy, some
support for Iran, a vehement
stand against a U.S. missile de-
fense plan for Easter European
countries and you get a Russia
that is much more than a thorn in
the America's backside.

ofthat are close to nil.

But is Russia trying to reclaim

Its a vicious cycle, but someone s gotta do it. Namely every major television network

Another “run with it” prod-
uct is the new series “Cavemen,”
following the popular run of the
Geico cavemen commercials. I
would anticipate a poor excuse
for a show but expectations are
high. Checking out an episode or
two probably wouldn’t kill you.

However it premiers Oct. 2

ABC actually has a pretty

tle’s favorite sex-crazed hospital
in “Grey’s Anatomy” and the
spin off“Private Practice.”

Back-stabbing housewives

spot on Sunday night at 9..

All in all I would lean towards
ABC this fall for a consistent pre-
sentation of entertainment.

Ruscio’s grand plan

Plan to shorten Spring Term may threaten C— and J-
schools, needs input from both students and faculty

We’ll say this for President Ken Ruscio.
When he has a new idea, he certainly knows
how to make a splash.

Last week Ruscio proposed several chang-
es to the university’s academic schedule, in-
cluding a proposal that would shorten Spring
Term to four weeks. '

With students taking just one class in the
spring, along with a cut in graduation require-
ments from 38 courses to 36, Ruscio hopes to
lighten the teaching load of W&L’s profes-
sors. '

We’re not sure yet if Ruscio’s plan is the
best option for W&L’s future. But there seems
to be a deﬁnite need to revise the current
Spring Term if it is going to survive.

As Ruscio has said, students don’t under-
stand the current Spring Option.

And even if we did understand it, most
of us would rather be enjoying Lexington or
studying abroad.

Above all, students and faculty don’t want
another exhausting, drawn-out ﬁght over the
future of Spring Term. We did that, we fought
those battles, and none of us want to hear the
same tired arguments again.

Ruscio understands that, and that’s why
he’s hoping for a quick decision.

lf, as he claims, the current Spring Term
system can’t survive, then a quick decision is
exactly what we need.

Students say they don’t want to lose two
weeks of Spring Term. But four weeks of fun
in Goshen sounds a lot better than no Spring

Term at all.

And faculty members are worried about
how they can ﬁt important classes into an even
tighter time-period.

Still, with students taking only one class
each term, professors will have the ability to
schedule classes any way they’d like.

Maybe you’ll want to have a two or three
hour block each day. Or maybe it would work
better to meet three times a week for ﬁve
hours.

That’s one of the best parts of Ruscio’s

If professors in the Williams School decide
that they don’t like the changes, should we
still go ahead‘?

W&L is no longer just a liberal arts col-
lege.

Our journalism and business schools are
well-known and well-liked in their respec-
tive ﬁelds. As more students pursue majors
in those schools each year, the college and its
leaders must keep the needs of those schools
in mind.

This much, at least, is clear. Ruscio’s pro-

tion. And even if we did understand it, most of us would rather

plan. There is room for ﬂexibility.

Multi—day ﬁeld trips are suddenly possible.
Art students could spend several days in D.C.
or New York without worrying about missing
other classes.

But as Ruscio and the faculty consider
these changes, the concerns of various depart-
ments should not be brushed aside.

lfthese changes will hurt W&L’s ability to
maintain an accredited joumalism school, are
the changes worth it‘?

posal has sparked a broad debate that should
continue around the campus this fall.

Ruscio and the faculty need to pay close at-
tention to the opinions of students while con-
sidering these changes.

The president really gets the best of both
worlds. If his proposal is approved, he’ll be
happy-

But even if it fails, he’s managed to kick-
start the debate on how Spring. Term should
look in coming years.

“Quiet in the house!” calls
Helen Coupe, Washington and
Lee junior and director of the
theater department’s third annual
Student Showcase. As perform-
ers rush in and out of rehearsal,
Coupe reviews the intended bill
for this weekend’s event. One
thi is for certain: The 2007 Stu-

‘ I de Showcase is something that

students will not want to miss.
Returning to the stage for yet

another round as Master of Cere-

monies is sophomore Markheav-

. ens Tshuma. Tshuma will also
be performing two acts in the

Student Showcase, one of which
includes a rendition of “Big,

' Blonde and Beautiful” from the

musical “Hairspray.”
“I like to think of this as the

Markheavens show,” said Tshu-
ma.

This year’s bill has ﬁfteen
engaging acts that range from

Reitz on guitar and a fun hip-hop
piece including sophomores So-
phie Xiong, Kenneth Hopkins
and Rasaq Lawal.

“The Student Showcase is a really special W&L

event, because its the only true talent show on

campus. Its a display of student talent without

all the stressful rehearsals and practice times. ’

monologues to arias and from
stand-up comedy routines to cho-
reographed dance pieces. The
line—up is also sprinkled with a
few student favorites like the V0-
cal stylings of Matt Amling, Eric

“With try-outs being held so
much earlier this year, I feel in-
credibly lucky that so many very
talented students came out to
audition,” said Coupe. “As a di-
rector, it makes my job so much

easier.”

The 2007 Student Showcase
will also be signiﬁcant for the
theater department since it serves
as Technical Director, Sha\vn
Paul Evans’s ﬁrst event.

“He has just been incredible
so far; we are so glad to have him,
and of course he will be working
on Othello and other productions
to come, as well,” said Coupe.

Coupe hopes that directing
this year’s Student Showcase will
pave the road for directing larger
productions in the coming years.

“I really want to prove myself
with the showcase so that I can
direct one of the three larger pro-
ductions for my senior directing
thesis,” said Coupe.

The Student Showcase will
be held in the Johnson Theatre
on Sept. 28th and 29th at 8 pm.
Tickets will be sold for $3 each.

and students who hope to attend
should call ahead to purchase
tickets since the show is expected
to sell out.

“Last year-we held the show-
case in the Keller Theatre and it
was almost full, so this year we
have two nights instead of one;
however, the Johnson Theatre is
substantially smaller, so students
really should call ahead to get
tickets," said Coupe.

While there are many oppor-
tunities for W&L students to get
involved in the arts on campus,
the Student Showcase truly is a
unique as well as a new tradition.

“The Student Showcase is a re-
ally special W&L event, because
it‘s the only true talent show on
campus,” said junior, Matt Am-
ling. “Its a display of student
talent without all the stressful re-
hearsals and practice times.”

Neville F ogarty discusses the trials and tribulations of the game show world

  "'°Wt° enter

By Kimber Wiggs
STAFF wrmrn

A few weeks ago, I found my-
self enthralled by the most exciting
gar. show 1 have ever watched,
including the ﬁrst episode of
“Who Wants to Be a Millionaire”
and any episode of “Jeopardy”

‘ featuring Ken Jennings. The show

was Merv Grifﬁn’s “Crosswords,”
and the contestant was none other
than Washington and Lee sopho-
more Neville Fogarty. Commons
345 was packed, as people from
all over campus came to watch
our compatriot in action. The

show did not disappoint.

The rules of “Crosswords” are
sinﬂe: answer clues to ﬁll in a
gia crossword puzzle and win
money. The show is a synthe-
sis of Merv Grifﬁn’s other two

gems: “Jeopardy” and “Wheel of .

Fortune.” The twist is that half-
way through the game, three new
people join with the objective of

' usurping the original contestants’

podiums. Time and again the
Commons audience booed and
hissed as Fogarty was unfairly
ousted from his winning position
by Pam and the “evil Scott.” I
admit I was nervous for our hero.

but Fogarty calmly revealed that
he was not worried.

 “I started playing a more risky
game,” F ogarty said. “I had my A
game in the front podium but my
A+ game in the back.”

Ultimately, the less worthy
contestants fell to the wayside as
Fogarty emerged victorious and
moved on to the equally exciting
bonus round. All in all he won
$3,450 in cash and a trip for 2
to Antigua; not bad for an hour’s
work.

Fogarty’s road to game show
stardom began at the tender age
of 12 when he appeared on an
episode of “Jeopardy’s” Back to
School Week. A few months later,
in the spring of 2001, Fogarty
appeared on an episode of Nick-
e1ode0n’s “Slimetime Live.” Just
last fall, Fogarty competed against
his mother and another man for a
chance at $100,000 in gold for a
show called “Gold Rush.”

Most people watching game
shows on TV think, “I’m smart-
er than those people. I could do
that.” Smarter, yes, but are you
also as personable, available, and
compatible with the interviewers’
needs? First, Fogarty had to pass

one of three written exams. Of
thirty people taking the test, seven
moved on, while the rest went
home with “nothing but two hours
wasted and tears in their eyes,”
Fogarty said.

Next, Fogarty sat for two per-
sonality interviews to make sure
he was not too shy or too crazy,
like the people who appear on

“If they asked me to do

[“Jeoparay”] again
but without any pay if I
win, I still would. ”

Neville Fogarty, class of 2010

“Deal or No Deal.”

After passing all the tests, F og-
arty was put into the contestant
pool for “later”, but he managed
to get himself put on an episode
the very next day: the fastest tum-
around the show has ever had.
Another thing that worked to his
advantage, Fogarty explained,

was that he was from out—of—town.
Because game shows often have
only one audition city, the major-
ity of people who appear on them
live in LA; failing actors who
need money, perhaps‘?

Coming from somewhere else
adds a little ﬂavor for the contes-
tant pool and is a good bargaining
chip if you want to be on a show
soon, because you need to go
home in a few days.

Fogarty has been making quite
a name for himself in the game
show industry. He even started a
W&L Quiz Bowl team with Su-
zanne Hange last year, bringing
his game show prowess straight to
campus.

Fogarty plans to audition for
more shows in the future. I asked
him why he does so many. One
would think the chance to win big
and be on TV would be a massive
draw. But he doesn’t do it for the
fame and fortune.

“It’sjust fun,” Fogarty said. “If
they asked me to do [“Jeopardy"]
again but without any pay if] win.
I still would.”

He said he loves the thrill of
the game, and he doesn‘t plan on
stopping anytime soon.

HFH lends a
helping hand

Habitat for Humanity brings students
and townies together through service

By Andrew Connelly
STA F F W R I T E R

As an international organization devoted to
building “simple, decent, and affordable” housing
that is celebrated throughout America and the world,
Habitat for Humanity (HFH) is a name you would
expect to hear more often around the Washington
and Lee campus.

Founded in 1976 in Americus, Georgia by Mil-
lard and Linda Fuller as a non-governmental and
non-proﬁt organization, HFH seeks to provide “a
hand up, not a hand out” and helps low income fam-
ilies build and own homes in their local area.

Built using a mixture of volunteer labor and
‘sweat equity’ whereby the family itself works on
site, the homes are sold to the families at no proﬁt,
with no interest charged on the mortgage. It has
been such a successful formula that HFH recently
celebrated its 225,000th house.

“Any new members this year will
be able to ﬁnd their niche. Just
being able to hold a paintbrush or
lay grass seed is great. ”

Claire Spadafora, class of 2010
 

The W&L chapter was formed in 1995 and works
in partnership with the Lexington/Rockbridge chap-
ter, helping to “educate and advocate” and get as
many people involved as possible.

This goal has developed into a rough delineation
of responsibility between the two sides, with the
students taking on a large part of the fund raising
duties and the townspeople leading the construction
efforts.

W&L raises approximately $25,000 every year
to fund the construction of one of the project homes
in the county, which cost $53,000 on average. This
year’s publicity chair, sophomore Claire Spadafora,
is eager to point out that this does not preclude the

students from taking an active role in the hands-on
work

“Any new members this year will be able to ﬁnd f

their niche,” she said.

In terms of new members, “we would love
anyone who is positive and able to get involved,”
Spadafora said.

On-site contributions can be made whenever
possible, ranging from several hours per week to an
hour or two per month. ‘

As far as technical skills are concerned, Spada-
fora makes it clear that enthusiasm and a willingness
to learn are the prime prerequisites. .

“Just being able to hold a paintbrush or lay grass
seed is great,” she said. “We always have experi- '
enced locals on hand to provide guidance.”

Some incoming W&L students have already
been given a taste of the work HFH does and of the
rewards that work can bring.

For the last six years, HF H has coordinated the
Lexington section of Volunteer Venture, the fresh-
man pre-orientation activities program that affords
incoming students the opportunity to take part in
charitable work in several areas in and around.?r»
ginia.

For the week before normal freshman orientation.
ﬁfteen freshman participants and six upperclassmen
leaders stayed on campus and drove out daily to
work on four homes in the nearby town of Glasgow.
Their work mainly consisted of outdoor landscaping
improvements, the bulk of the construction work al-
ready having been completed.

By all accounts, this “tuming a house into a
home,” as Spadafora put it, was something enjoyed
by all involved.

Junior leader Dana Statton spoke about her fI‘<,.Sl1-
man experience. “It was a great feeling to look back
on the week and see all that we accomplished,” she ’
said.

This year, W&L HFH hopes to construct four ‘
homes in the area and raise funds to help local it
families realize their dream of home ownership.

Wesleyan is second half comeback
hands W&L a heartbreaking loss

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington & Lee Women’s Soccer
team was 2-1 this week, defeating Greens-
boro College and Hollins University, while
losing to rival Virginia Wesleyan College in
a battle of two closely ranked top 25 teams.

Over the past three years, W&L and Vir-
ginia Wesleyan have engaged in ﬁve games;
all but one have been decided by one goal
or less. The Generals are 0-3-2 over that
stretch. Furthermore, Virginia Wesleyan
ended W&L’s season last year in the Elite
Eight of the NCAA Tournament on penalty
kicks.

Once again, the two teams treated fans to
an intense game. The teams went back and
forth until the Generals asserted themselves.
At 26:26, junior Anne Van Devender broke
free from her defender, but did not have a
good angle for her shot. Instead, she set up
Erica Girodano who managed to strike the
ball just past the Marlins’ goalie, Lindsey
Williams. '

For the next 30 minutes, neither team was
able to take advantage of the few opportu-
nities. Then at 57:53, Virginia Wesleyan’s
Laura Jackson stalemated the game at 1-1 af-
ter receiving a pass from Missy Kuhns. Just
15 minutes later (72:10), Jackson found the
net again for her second goal and the even-
tual game winner. W&L continued its attack
in the waning moments of the game, but it
did not translate into a goal. The ﬁnal score
was 2-1.

For the second time all year, W&L was
out-shot during the match and the result was
the same: a loss. The Generals had 12 shots,
compared to the 16 by the Marlins. Howev-
er, the biggest disparity was in comer kicks;
W&L had 4 compared to 10 by VW. Also,
junior goalie Kiki Moreo made 4 saves in the
effort.

On Sunday, Sept. 16, one day after de-
feating conference opponent Randolph-Ma-
con, the women faced Greensboro at home.
Greensboro, which plays in the USA South
Conference, entered the match with an im-
pressive 4-0-1 record.

At the start of the game, the Generals were
not able to convert on several opportunities;
the team was relentless in its attack but came
up empty. Neither team scored until the sec-
ond half and, in contrast to most games, it
was not W&L who cracked the scoreboard
ﬁrst. After the Generals were thwarted by
the Greensboro goalie, Shana Saganich, the

Pride quickly marched down ﬁeld and, in the
65"‘ minute, capitalized on a goal by fresh-
man forward Cassie Sheppard.

Consequently, team captains Martha
Caulkins and Anne Van Devender called for
a team huddle. The team emerged rejuvenat-
ed and knotted the game at 1-1 off of an un-
assisted goal by Van Devender at 76:57. “It
took a goal from Greensboro to make us re-
alize that we had to take advantage of those
chances we had been getting all game,” said
Van Devender. “In those last 14 minutes, we
just wanted it more than they did.”

Just eight minutes later, at 84:53, W&L
received a gift when the Generals were
awarded a penalty kick as a result of a hand
ball in the box. Freshman Roz Klann was the
recipient of the free kick, and she took ad-
vantage of the opportunity. Klann said of the
kick, “I approached the ball straight on and
kicked it a little left of center, and she dove
for it and missed it.”

Four minutes later, at 88:32, Katie Corr
managed to weave through the Greensboro
defense and score, putting an exclamation
point on the afternoon. The ﬁnal score was
3-1. .

After the game, Klann commented on the
pressure of taking the penalty kick. “There
is no better feeling than stepping up when
everything is on the line and coming up big
for your team. Everybody worked incredibly
hard throughout the game on Sunday, and I
love to take the opportunity to come through
for my team in big games. There was not a
doubt in my mind I wanted that kick.”

After a tough home game against Greens-
boro, the Generals traveled to play Hollins
University in nearby Roanoke on Wednes-
day. While the previous game was tight

' throughout, this match was not.

Thirty seconds into the game, freshman
Laura Youngmeyer scored off of a pass from
Katie Kern. This goal set the tempo for the
afternoon as W&L amassed a staggering 7-0
halftime lead. In the second half, the team
continued the onslaught by adding two more
goals in the 9-0 victory.

In total, W&L compiled 36 shots com-
pared to one by Hollins. In the effort, Van
Devender, Caulkins and Taylor Garrett each
had two goals a piece.

Washington & Lee now has a 5-2 overall
record and is 3-1 in conference play. Next
week, the Generals face two more confer-
ence opponents: Bridgewater College at
home and Emory & Henry College on the
road.

' Men stomp Gi

Dodd is hat trick and stifling   

defense lead to 5-0 victory

By Michael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

The men’s soccer team opened ODAC play
this week, traveling to Lynchburg to take on the
Hornets Wednesday evening and

s°°"°5 hosting Guilford on Saturday.
W&L 5 The Generals battled Lynchburg

to a 0-0 double overtime draw
Guilford O

and routed the Quakers 5-0.

The Generals were ranked
fourth in the ODAC Coaches Preseason Poll,
trailing preseason favorite Roanoke, Virginia
Wesleyan and Lynchburg.

“People are going to say that we are under-
rated, but I feel like fourth is very fair,” said
senior Ted Sheedy. “We haven’t earned a better
ranking with our past results. We can’t just sit
around and wait for people to give us respect; it
is up to us to show our worth on the ﬁeld.”

“I think that is about accurate considering
the seniors we lost last year,” agreed Junior
John Lindsay, “but I think we have the ability to
ﬁnish in the top three.”

During the Wednesday night match, the Gen-
erals out shot the Lynchburg 22-19 and earned
one more comer kick but couldn’t ﬁnd the back
of the net. Sheedy played all ll0 minutes and
had six saves for W&L, while Lynchburg’s
Marcus Jordan matched those totals in goal for
the Hornets.

“To get a point at Lynchburg is nice,” said
Sheedy. “But I am somewhat disappointed that
we didn’t get the win because I felt we were
dangerous and had several opportunities to
score.”

The Generals made sure to take advantage
of their opportunities during Saturday’s game
against Guilford. After about ﬁve minutes of
play, it was clear the Generals were the domi-
nant team.

Senior Josh Dodds found the back of the
net twice in the ﬁrst half and freshman James
Pymm added another goal with less than ten
minutes to play in the half to give the Generals
a 3-0 lead at the break.

“Getting the early goals helped us relax the
rest of the game,” said junior John Lindsay.

The Quakers best scoring chance came with
eighteen minutes to play in the ﬁrst half when
they managed a shot from the top of the box.
However, Sheedy was in perfect position to
make one of his two saves.

Fifteen minutes into the second half, junior

Tommy Pignatelli crossed the ball from the right
side, junior Whitt Larkin ﬂicked it on through
the box, and Dodds shot it into the back of the
net from just outside the goal box to complete
his hat trick.

Several times throughout the game tempers
ﬂared. With less than ﬁfteen minutes to play in
the ﬁrst half, Lynchburg defender Brandon Tay-
lor was shown a yellow card for an aggressive
tackle in the midﬁeld.

With about thirty minutes to play in the
game, Lindsay was carded for taunting after a
verbal exchange with a Lynchburg defender.

The most aggressive outburst of the game,
however, was by Lynchburg goalie Beau Ar-

“People are going to say that
we are underrated, but I feel
like fourth is very fair. We
haven ’t earned a better ranking
with our past results. We can’t
just sit around and wait for
people to give us respect; it is
up to us to show our worth on

ceneaux. After senior Travis Short tacked on
a ﬁfth goal with less than three minutes to
play, Arceneaux, who had already having been
warned twice by the referee, unleashed a pro-
fanity-laced tirade against his defenders, cam-
ing himself the game’s third booking.

Sheedy was pleased with the game.

“All the pieces are in place, it is just a matter
of executing when it matters,” said Sheedy.

The Generals return to action this week with
two ODAC matches.

On Wednesday they travel to Randolph-Ma-
con for a 4 pm. contest, and on Saturday they
host Eastern Mennonite at 1 pm.

Generals improve to
2-0 with 35-2] win
over reigning USA
South Conference

’ champions Averett

By Brian Devine
surr WRITER

Part of the attraction of
watching a football game is
the heart-stopping moments
when it appears that no amount
of skill, strategy or determina-
tion can lead a team to victory.
Close contests provide a back-
and-forth thrill ride, and there
is little better than watching
two evenly matched opponents
take and miss their chances to
score up until the bitter end.

Just ask the dozens of Wash-
ington and Lee students who
made the trip to Salem for the
Generals’ neutral-site contest
against the Averett Cougars.
The defending Old Dominion
Athletic Conference champions
eked out a 35-21 victory over
their opponents, themselves the
title holders in the USA South
Conference. Salem Stadium,
the venue for the NCAA Divi-
sion lII football championship
game, hosted the two titans as a
beneﬁt for Habitat for Human-
ity. The vocal crowd watched

rushing. Luby in particular had
a stellar night, with 14 tackles,
several of which would be best
described as “bone-crunching.”
Matteo sacked Averett quarter-
back Shan Fairbanks twice, and
Fulk was his usual dominant
self, credited with nine tackles
but also drawing two key false
start calls fromthe Averett of-
fensive line.

When Fairbanks wasn’t
becoming acquainted with the
Salem Stadium artiﬁcial turf,
he played well, passing for
209 yards and one touchdown.
Fairbanks was especially effec-
tive when throwing to wideout
Antonio Hammond (5 catches,
45 yards). Later in the contest,
the W&L secondary stepped up
their coverage, and before long
Fairbanks was throwing most-
ly short passes to his running
backs. Averett’s giant fullback
Brian Daniels had the Cougars’
ﬁnal touchdown but was other-
wise limited.

W&L’s rushing attack, lim-
ited early on by ineffective
play-calling that saw rushers

“[W&L has] some of the best fans in Divi-
sion III. [They] make it really fun to play. ”

a game that was much closer
than the two-touchdown mar-
gin of victory indicates.
Averett had a 21-20 lead
with 4:37 to go in the third
quarter but failed to score again.
The Generals’ vaunted defense
had difficulty containing the
Cougars in the early stages
but held them when it counted
most. The game unfolded at a
slower-than-usual pace, thanks
to the defensive play from both
sides, several injuries on both
teams -- none serious -- and a
refereeing crew that seemed to
stop play for no reason. Safety
Kyle Luby, linebacker Bryant
Fulk and defensive end Tommy
Matteo, the hard-hitting pil-
lars of W&L’s defense, held
the Cougars’ highly-touted
offense to just 79 total yards

Tom Pacicco and Stuart Sitter-
son often swarmed at the line,
changed focus in the second
quarter to great effect. Instead
of pulling blockers to the out-
side and running horizontally,
Pacicco began running down-
ﬁeld straight from the handoff.
The offensive line’s run block-
ing was excellent, and Pacicco
ended with 179 yards and 2
touchdowns on 27 attempts.
Sitterson also added the Blue-
and-White’s go-ahead touch-
down in the fourth quarter and
caught R.J. Vamer’s pass on
the two-point conversion to put
the Generals up 28-21.

Varner had a mixed game,
throwing two touchdown pass-
es to Jack Martin but also losing
two fumbles in the ﬁrst quarter.
He ﬁnished ll-for-23 with 193

yards and an interception that
was returned for the Cougars’
ﬁrst touchdown.

The Cougars seemed to
have done their homework and
rarely left the always-danger-
ous Martin in single cover-
age after the ﬁrst touchdown,
which came just a minute into

' the game.

Even with help, comerback
Calvin Hall had trouble con-
taining Martin, who simply
outjumped him to catch his
second score.

The loyal and vocal W&L
supporters took to chanting
“Heisman” for Martin, who
ﬁnished the game as the Blue-
and-White’s all-time career re-
ceiving leader. The record, set
by J .T. Malatesta, a 1999 grad-
uate, was 2,312 yards. Martin
now has 2,403 in his college
career and has seven regular-
season games remaining to add
to his lead.

His big-play capability,
along with the sheer power of
Pacicco and the hard-nosed
play of Luby, enthralled the
W&L supporters that made
the trip to Salem. “[W&L has]
some of the best fans in Divi-
sion IlI,” said linebacker Kyle
Harvey after the game. “[Theyl

make it really fun to play.”

Fan support may have been
just what was needed to take
the team through those heart-
stopping moments and on to
close victory. If the team is to
reach their goals and win the
conference for the second year
in a row, they may need it a few
more times.
