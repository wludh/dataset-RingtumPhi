Alliance sends students to foreign countries to serve impoverished

Five of the seven Washington and Lee
students who were international interns for
the Shepherd Poverty Program spoke about
their experiences in Ghana, Tanzania, Po-
land, Peru and Brazil last Thursday night in
the Commons.

Presenters included seniors Angela
Young, Katelyn Finley, Katherine Chiasson,
Nicole Merrullo and junior Eugina Huang.
Each spent eight weeks in a foreign country
living with local families and interning for
organizations that provide day care, health-
care and education to the needy.

Though the Shepherd program offers a
variety of domestic internships, these stu-

dents chose to explore poverty on an inter-
national level.

Young, who worked in Tanzania, said
she chose an internship abroad “not because
poverty here is non—existent. I just think it’s
so much more drastic in other places that I
just wanted to be there.”

All ﬁve interns observed poverty ﬁrst-
hand and found ways to help, which is the

purpose of the Shepherd Program.

“Everyone was sick, and half of them
had malaria,” said Chiasson, who served at
a public hospital in Ghana.

She noted that healthcare is accessible to
everyone, but sanitary practices are lacking
and work ethic is low. She said that none of
the nurses wore gloves and had little concern
for their patients’ conditions.

Although AIDS, sickness and death char-
acterize life in Ghana today, Chiasson is op-
timistic and believes the situation will only
improve through a greater level of educa-
tion.

her ﬁrst three weeks in Dar es Salaam, a

Ruscio’s proposal

N X Washington Terms to continue
despite shorter Spring semester

By Dane Davls
STAFF wnmzn

Washington Term and New York Term will likely continue to
be six weeks long, despite recent proposed changes in Spring Term
duration.

At information sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday of last
week, politics professors William Connelly and Mark Rush told
students that both programs have been grandfathered in and would

remain six weeks long despite a potential four-week’ Spring Term.

The announcements come aﬁer concerns over the viability of
the two six—week programs in light of President Ken Ruscio’s new
proposal for the term.

Ruscio’s plan is to shorten spring term from six weeks to four
and decrease the number of courses professors are required to
teach per year. However, with both Washington Term and New
York Term lasting at least six weeks, some questioned the compat-
ibility of a four-week term with the two internship programs.

Both the Washington Term and New York Term combine in-
tense internships in politics and business with equally intensive
classes.

At the Washington Term meeting, Connelly said that “Having a
four-week Washington Term Program wouldn’t be possible. Most
internship sites are reluctant to take students for six weeks, let
alone four."

Connelly went on to say that it was the students who would
determine whether the internship program would continue. When
Connelly conducted an impromptu survey of whether students
would remain interested if the program required them to be in
class two weeks after summer vacation began, the results were
overwhelmingly positive. Only a few were reluctant to accept that
added burden.

Junior Rich Cleary, the Washington Term’s work study, said,
“The presence of Professor Connelly amidst the ﬁeld of applicants
probably skewed those results.”

Cleary also said, “The issue would be to students—[if] they are

Students for Life localize national ‘4O days’ movement

W&L community members gather in library to pray for abortion victims, coordinate activities to increase awareness

VOLUME GXI, NUMBER/3/4.

Wednesday marked the ﬁrst day of
a nationwide pro-life movement called
40 Days for Life. This campaign aims
to spread awareness about pro-life is-
sues, bring prayers and healing to those
who have been affected by abortion
and eventually bring an end to all abor-
tions.

The Students for Life organization
at Washington and Lee has been re-
sponsible for bringing the movement to
Lexington. Last Wednesday at 10 p.m.,
nine students gathered in the Sacred
Space room, a newly consecrated reli-
gious meeting place in the library, for
reﬂection and prayer. Students for Life
is the ﬁrst organization to reserve this
space for a speciﬁc religious purpose.

“If you are religious, you believe
that prayer makes a difference. Prayer
also brings people together,” said senior
Jameson Graber, president of SFL.

Graber led the group in opening and
closing prayer, and sophomore secre-
tary Jessica Makona read a devotion.

SFL members will continue to meet
every night of the 40 days for prayer
and meditation. Meetings are open to

and educational community efforts.
SFL plans to hold a community-wide
vigil on campus at the conclusion of
the 40 days on Nov. 4, and the group
may also attend a vigil to be held at an

all students and faculty.

“I personally plan to be there every
night to pray for the victims of abor-
tions, both women and children,” said
Graber.

Prayer and fasting are one compo- ,

nent of 40 Days for Life, but the cam-

abortion clinic.

A grassroots effort to increase
awareness will also be launched. Fly-
ers and informational posters will soon
appear around campus, and SFL will
be working with local churches and
schools for educational purposes and

to coordinate donation drives to collect
diapers and baby clothing.

These donations will go to pregnan-
cy clinics such as ComfortCare Wom-
en’s Health in Staunton, Va.

“The ﬁrst step is to create aware-
ness,” Makona said. “It’s hard work,
but we have to start somewhere.”

The month of October is also Re-
spect Life Month, during which pro-life
supporters honor the belief that human
life is sacred and should be protected at
all times, from the moment of concep-
tion until natural death.

Students for Life plans to coordi-
nate other activities throughout the
year. Members plan to donate time and
money to pregnancy centers, hospices
and other pro-life efforts.

They will also continue to post
weekly “factoids” about abortion and
other issues around campus, even after
40 Days for Life has concluded.

“Reaching out to other people
spreads the effect,” said freshman Alex

Sweetser. “Maybe it will reach some-
one in the situation, and then it will be
saving a life.”

SFL members believe that their
cause is inherently important to W&L.
“Our mission is crucial to any college
campus,” Graber said.

“Fiﬁy-two percent of abortions hap-
pen to college-age women, so the de-
bate is important here. People are un-
sure of their stance on this issue, and it
is disastrous to be undecided.”

After just a few days, the national
40 Days for Life campaign has already
created results.

According to David Bereit, the na-
tional campaign director, word has
been received that several abortion
clinics and Planned Parenthood loca-
tions around the country have closed
or stopped operating in cities where the
peaceful vigils are taking place.

SFL members at W&L hope to echo
these efforts and bring the effects closer
to home.

That same dilemma
faces the students applying
to the New York Term. At
the Wednesday information
meeting for the program,
Rush and business and ad-
ministration professor Kip
Pirkle did not mention the
potential changes to spring
term.

Instead, they focused on
the advantages of having a
six-week internship before
most college students are
free for the summer. The
early experience gained is
invaluable not only for the
rest of the summer, but also
for future job prospects.

Students, though, seem
to be willing to sacriﬁce two
weeks of summer for the op-
portunities both programs
afford. Over 70 students
turned out for the New York
meeting, and about 30 came
to the Washington Term
meeting.

Despite any potential
changes, the values and
skills gained from both pro-
grams still remain. Cleary,
speaking of Washington
Term, said, “You examine
as a class the various ex-
periences in Washington.
It really makes for a great
cross-pollinating intellectual
experience.”

' Real world versus Lex Vegas

Swiping home all your needs for four years is handy, but it doesn’t translate well when we leave W&L

By Grace Andrews
C0 LU M N l ST

W&L can make us oblivious to
how people live in the real world.
You’re probably saying to your-
self at this exact moment, “what
does that mean?”

Let’s start with the habit peo-
ple in our school have of leaving
valuable items, such as wallets,
jackets, and shoes in any locale
that they wish and then posting a
campus notice when they realize
that these items are gone.

In the real world, when you
leave something in a public place,
what usually happens after that is
called theft. '

For those of you readers shak-
ing your head in disbelief, I am
speaking from personal expe-
rience. Just two weeks ago, I
ﬂew home for the weekend and
removed my rings to wash my
hands in an airport bathroom. I,
of course, forgot the rings on the
sink counter and did not realize I
did so until I was out of the check
point.

By the time I had gotten a

void ticket to go back to the wait-
ing area and the ladies’ room, the
rings were gone. I enforced the as-
sistance of the nice maintenance
woman, who did her best to page
her colleagues, but to no avail. I
even reported it to Nashville air-
port lost and found. The rings I
lost had very little monetary value
but were absolutely priceless in
sentimental value, making them
irreplaceable.

See, I’ve done that before on
campus, but of course no one
touched them and I was able to
rescue them for the same spot
in which I abandoned them. So
what’s the lesson? Don’t leave
your stuff lying around, even if
this is W&L; don’t be testing that
Honor System.

Second, let’s explore the topic
of people not locking their room
doors or car doors. You see, this
is what I’ve called “small-town
syndrome.” In smaller towns, like
the one I grew up in, people leave
everything unlocked and then
act confused when they ﬁnd out
things are missing.

I know that prior to stepping on

campus, I was lock-happy. I was
what you may call a lock-a—holic.
I’d lock things that there weren’t
even keys for. Arriving at W&L
three years ago, I was shocked
to learn that no one locked their
doors, except for those amongst
us whom we quickly began to call

or safe for you to do so; here all
we do is leave things wide open.
Students on this campus also
have the desire to put themselves
in unsafe situations, say like
walking to your apartment at 3
a.m. all alone, despite the fact that
you live somewhere that involves

“paranoid” for doing so. Maybe
we should have been calling them
S-M-A-R-T, because that’s what
they are. When’s the last time you
saw someone in the “real world"
leaving something as valuable
as a car unlocked or their house
entirely unlocked, even if they’re
not home.

That’s right! You probably
haven’t, because it’s not practical

wooded areas and deserted trails
(yes, I‘m talking about Woods
Creek).

livery day, students who live
slightly off campus leave at un-
godly times with total disregard
of their personal safety. lt’s be-
cause at W&L, everyone has seen
or met everyone. Because we feel
like “we know people,” we have
no problem walking alone across

Cadaver bridge or going the back
way from the library to Woods
Creek. This is what some may
call DANGEROUS! In the real
world, we’d be snatched up faster
than a balding weather man’s tou-
pee during a hurricane.

Last but not least, lets us in-
vestigate the terrible ﬁnancial
habits some of us learn here at
01’ Dubyanell. You see the swipe
card on this campus is one that is
comparable to crack! Yes, crack,
the highly addictive drug. That’s
the only reason I can understand
for why people don’t carry cash
on this campus. Searching for an
actual dollar is like the crowning
of an overweight woman as Miss
America — never going to hap-
pen.

I myself enjoy swiping home
despite the fact that my parents
send me the bill or just remove the
money from my personal account.
You see, my parents don’t believe
in that swiping game and depend
on the fact that every cent I spend
is my own. That doesn’t keep me
from swiping, but instead helps
me regulate how much I swipe.

In the real world, the swipe
system is comparable to hav-
ing a credit card, except unlike
a personal credit card, your par-
ents pay the bill. Such a system
teaches people to swipe now and
worry later, which can translate
into independent adult life, but
result in what some of us like to
call DEBT! Debt is in no shape,
form, or fashion sexy and will
ruin your life.

So for all you swipe-happy
folks out there, get your life to-
gether and think before swiping.
I’m not saying don’t swipe at all,
but don’t be swinging that card
around like Jason does his chain-
saw

You see my friends, the real
world is very much unlike W&L.
Out there, people very rarely
give a damn about you or your
items and don’t respect tradi-
tions such as the Honor System.
For this reason, I implore all of
you to remember that when you
leave W&L, you’re leaving a
safeguarded community, and you
should exercise a basic knowl-
edge of outside world.

A fresh perspective comes to town

At a pivotal junction, freshmen can be pioneers forging ahead, deﬁning themselves

By Scott Graham Centorino
c o L u M N I s T

Very few moments in our lives
have the power to deﬁne who we
are. This is true, perhaps, only be-
cause such moments are so rare
and so testing.

Most of you have either lived
“the freshman experience” at
W&L in the past or are living it as
you glance at this ink.

All of us have come to under-
stand that the ﬁrst few weeks are
not so much days and weeks, but
truly one grand moment. It is a
separation from all things famil-

parents or home, but from our
previous world.

In fact, very little concretely
unites us as a student body. We
hail from so many different states
and countries, and are pursuing so
many different things here and in
life, that it is often difficult to see
how the wheels are turning on this
bandwagon of dissimilarity.

I do not mean to repeat the cli-

ches of “what divides us is what

brings us together,” or that our
diversity is our strength. While
these are both wonderful expres-
sions, they cower against the true
nature of our endeavor.

We are pioneers. What else
would you call a group like this
collecting to go on an adventure
together?

But the men and women on the
Oregon Trail did not pause during
times of starvation and bombard-
ment to note that their strength
came from the diversity of their
members. The crew of Apollo 11
did not stop during their mission
to the moon to remark on how re-
markable it was for them to have
come from different regions and
backgrounds.

In every case where challeng-
es were faced and met, strength

does not come from our diversity,
or from our division, but from our
strength to dismiss such differ-
ences and to ignore them.

The pioneers did not stop to
reminisce. They were in the heat
of a deﬁning moment in their
lives, where their own conditions
took a backseat to the ultimate
goal. To gaze around at each other
and marvel distracts us from what
we should be looking at - the road
ahead.

So what do we know? We
know what we are doing is piv-
otal. We know that others have
done it before. We know W&L is

“Controversial” speaker not to blame

Columbia didn ’t want to learn from the Iranian president, only to berate him

By Crighton Allen
C0 LU M N I SI

On Sept. 24, 2007, Iranian President Mah-
moud Ahmadinejad spoke before a packed
auditorium at Columbia University’s School
of International and Public Affairs on the invi-
tation of University President Lee Bollinger.

Predictably, many people are outraged that
so “controversial” a ﬁgure garnered an invite
to speak before an audience of university stu-
dents.

While I too am upset about this, I quibble
with those who call Ahmadinejad “contro-
versial.” Controversy would imply a dispute
about the man, and there seems to be a con-
sensus that Ahmadinejad’s comments are vile
and that his worldview is highly reprehen-
sible. '

For those ofyou unfamiliar with this speci-
men, let me hit you with some highlights: Ac-
cording to Amnesty International, 210 people
have been executed this year in Iran, the ma-
jority by hanging.

According to reports by the Council on
Foreign Relations, Iran is a state sponsor of
terror and funds such violent group as the
Lebanese Hezbollah, Palestinian Hamas, and
Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The commander of
U.S. force in Iraq, General David Petraeus,
reported this month that arms supplies from
Iran, including 240mm rockets and rocket
propelled grenades (RPGS), are contributing
to “a sophistication of attacks that would by
no means be possible without Iranian sup-
port.”

Judging by how he runs his nation, Ahma-
dinejad isn’t exactly the guy you ladies want
to bring home to meet the parents.

What he says is even more disturbing:
“They have invented a myth that Jews were
massacred and place this above God, re-
ligions, and the prophets”; “anybody who
recognizes Israel will burn in the ﬁre of the
Islamic nation’s fury”; “Iran doesn’t have the
issue of homosexuals.”

Quick recap of Ahmadinejad: He denies

the Holocaust took place, longs deeply for
the destruction of Israel, and regards human
rights the way you might a leaf. Yet, this man
was invited by one of Ameriea’s leading uni-
versities to give a lecture.

Let me be clear; he has every right to hold
these opinions, despite how loathsome they
may be, and Bollinger was within his rights
and power to invite him. That is not the issue
here, however.

If I comprehend the underlying concept of
a liberal college education correctly, a princi-
pal method by which one gains understanding
of the world and its workings is by engaging
in rational and civil discourse with another

Someone 3 mother or father is

lows his nation to overtly sup-

port terrorism. That Columbia

bloody hands is nauseating.

whose opinions differ from one’s own. In the
case of Ahmadinejad, his discourse can offer
neither.

The positions he holds in regards to Juda-
ism, Israel, and human rights are absolutely
untenable, and the president offers zero justi-
ﬁcation for his beliefs other than an occasion
rant of his perversion of Islam.

And lest we forget, Iran has ﬁnanced,
armed, and done everything else save actively
take up arms alongside the insurgents to aid
them in their quest to spread chaos and death
in Iraq. The commander of American troops
stated on the record that the insurgency would
not be at its current strength without Iranian
support.

Ahmadinejad is not directly culpable, but
American servicemen and servicewomen,
someone’s mother. father, daughter, son, sis-
ter, brother, wife, or husband is dead because
Ahmadinejad allows his nation to overtly
support terrorism. That Columbia received
this man with his hands sodden by American
soldiers’ blood is, frankly, nauseating.

The Iranian president merely accepted an
offer extended to him; the guilty party in this
circumstance is clearly Bollinger and the rest
of the administration.

During his introduction of the president,
Bollinger took multiple potshots at Ahma-
dinejad calling him, among other things, “a
cruel and petty dictator.” Bollinger used the
Ivy League reputation ofhis university to at-
tract the Iranian leader then pulled a bait-and-
switch, using his time on stage to throw in his
two cents.

If you feel that the man is a dictator with
“preposterous and belligerent" views, do not
give him another platform to disseminate
them further.

Also not receiving a free pass is the Dean
of the Policy School, John Coatsworth. The
day after Admadinejad’s appearance, Dean
Coatsworth was asked to justify the invita-
tion. He made the remark: “if Hitler were in
the United States and. . . if he were willing
to engage in a debate and a discussion to be
challenged by Columbia students and faculty,
we would certainly invite him."

‘ If Hitler is your go-to argument in a de-
bate, you lose, period. Also, the Hitler ref-
erence adds insult to injury the large Jewish
population of Columbia who had to stomach
the appearance of a man who calls for the de-
struction of their people just days after cel-
ebrating a holy day, Yom Kippur.

Ahmadinejad has caused enough suffering
in the world from far-away Iran. Inviting him
to America is nothing short of moronic and
offensive.

Bollinger should be ashamed and disap-
pointed; many in the Columbia University
family and America certainly are.

a great place to be.

After all, we have all taken
classes before; we have all had
to make new friends and adapt to
new environments. What is new?

None of us have taken class-
es here or lived here, or adapted
here.

Here is new. But here is now.

Years from now, if not next
week, you will look back at these
times. The upperclassmen read-
ing this are already reminiscing.
We will not see our ﬁrst frat party,
or ﬁrst encounter with our room-
mate, or even our ﬁrst class.

What we will see is truly

“the freshman experience.” We
will see a pillar of our nature, a
juncture of our own being on this
small planet.

Do not ask yourself, “How
much of this homework should
I do if I know the teacher won’t
check it? What should I wear
to the sorority dinners? or what
should I do when I don’t know
anyone at the D-hall?”

Ask yourself, “where I do I go
from here?”

Then, and only then can we
say we have lived “the freshman
experience.” Then, we can begin
to deﬁne ourselves.

The law school hoasts about
-Princeton Review rankings

Gir-

Are the Princeton Review ranl<;ings a valid source for as-
scsting college cha1'acteri:‘.tics? At \»’v’¢‘s’Ll-, the answer is appar-
ently “yes” and “no.”

The School of Law boasts on its website that W&L rates
li3=?h in the Princeton Review rankings for both faculty quality
student engagement: “The 2007 results placed W&L at the
top oftlie ‘Professors Rock (Legally Speaking)" category and
sixth in ‘Best Overall Academic ljxpericncc.”’

5-lowever, the College, for which W&L rates high in less
(lu.'il’éll)lC categories (“Lots of Hard siquor." “Lots of Beer,”
“l_.i;éle Class/Race Interaction,” and “Alternative Lifestyles
Not an Alternative’), still circulates a 2004 report attacking
the rankings: “The Princeton Review...is a perfect example
ol"..ni ill-constructed opinion stiijvey. Unfortunately, there is no
way of preventing this sort of cliicanery frorn being depicted
as '~-.!.:ience to the public.”

 
  

The university isfor tl e l’rin.r_.'etor1 Review

ll/4.-32L must accept the rankings or reject

the rankings. It can ’t have it both ways.

In other words. the university is for the /’rim:c/on Review
rankings except when it’s against them‘?

Someone needs to get the story straight.

The current inconsistency--touting a ranking system when
it's convenient and chastising it when it’s not——can only be rec-
ognized as opportunistic.

Surely, all methodologies for ranking colleges have their
shortcomings, and the Princeton Review’s is chief among
them. Yet,.,eitl1er W&L must accept the rankings (both the good
and the  or it must reject the rzmkings (both the good and
lwzti.-ii. It can’t have it both ways.

if the rankings trulydo a service to prospective students,

edge and take heed oftheir varied implications.

ifthe rankings truly do a disservice to prospective students,
vilf-..h I personally accept. the proper response is to supple-
nn:.it or replace them with better evidence.

Until an honorable institutional decision is made, the Princ-
eton Review rankings will remain a cause ofembarrassment for
W&L--especially when the administration knowingly cherry-
picks them for mere public relations purposes.

l tear Editors,

i read with dismay and alarm Dane Boston's attack on
WrS:.L’s Greek system. In the Sept. I7, Phi, this “sentimental
senior” provided the incoming freshman with “a few words of
advice as they begin their illustrious careers at Washington and
Lee.” After acknowledging the existence and importance of
tradition at W&L. Mr. Dane speaks with contempt of the many
“unfortunate elements of our institutions” that are allowed to
persist because students are “swayed by appeals to obscure
comepts of tradition.” Mr. Dane laments the probability that
these arcane concepts “limit this place“ in the eyes of prospec-
tive students. Dane goes on to declare that “if this place is to
survive and thrive in the years to come” these concepts must
be “addressed.”

for 150 years the Greek system at W&L has provided a
nieans for like minded men and now women to enjoy friend-
ships and make memories.

My own advice to the freshmen would include “live and let
live.” There are as many ways to go through W&L as there are
stmlents that have and will attend the University.

I agree with l\/lr. Dane - “this place will change you.” Be-
liei c it or not this has always been true. The Greek system is a
time-tested tradition that I believe is important to “this place.”

'l‘raditi0na change

Shortening Spring Term won ’t mean
less free time or kill the tradition of
frequently ﬂoating down the Maury

By Cody Beauchamp
c o L u M N I sr

President Ruscio is on to some-
thing.

If I’m any good at gauging the
zeitgeist, the student body met his
announcement that he wanted to
make sweeping changes to Spring
Term with mixed feelings.

I’ve heard a lot of people object
with horror upon realizing that the
beloved term could become shorter.
I’ve heard skeptics question wheth-
er or not the proposals to “tweak
the numbers” will do much.

But there’s really no reason to
worry, sports fans.

In the memo he sent to the fac-
ulty that started this current Spring
Term discussion, Ruscio actually
makes a good case for his changes.

He notes that Washington and
Lee’s academic structure “simply
can’t bear its weight,” and he’s
right. It’s virtually impossible to

fewer parties and less time. How
does that make sense? Obviously
the term will be shortened (by two
weeks), but since the class require-
ments are cut in half, it seems logi-
cal that the free time will double.

Also, as much as I love ﬂoat-
ing the Maury, I’d much rather hit
the beach, ﬂoat the rivers near my
house, or whatever. Getting out of
school two weeks earlier means an
additional two weeks when classes
don’t keep me within driving dis-
tance of Lexington.

Change isn’t something we do
well at W&L. We really are a rather
conservative schoo1—not political-
ly conservative per so (although the
prevalence of those Reagan/Mari-
lyn shirts is a little ridiculous), but
conservative in the true sense of the
word—we don’t change radically.

But sometimes we should take
a look around and realize change
is needed. I love having six weeks
every year to cut back with mini-

I love having six weeks every year to cut back

with minimal responsibility. But I also love the

than get a really good tan.

keep our amazingly—low average
class size while at the same time
only hiring the most qualiﬁed
professors and requiring as many
credits for graduation as we do. It
doesn’t take the entire provost’s of-
ﬁce to ﬁgure that one out.

So what is the‘president’s pro-
posal? It’s a lower teaching load
for the faculty, a shorter term, and
a lower graduation requirement for
students.

The new plan would require a
5.5 teaching load for the faculty.
Don’t get me wrong; that’s still an
awful lot for what is essentially a
mini—mester, but it’s deﬁnitely a
step in the right direction.

The new plan would lower
the graduation requirement to 36
courses. That’s still high for a col-
lege of our nature—a liberal arts
college—but I certainly won’t
complain about a lower class re-
quirement.

The plan even grandfathers pro-
grams that are designed for the six
week version of Spring Term.

The complaint I hear the most
is that shortening Spring Term will
make it less fun, that there will be

mal responsibility. But I also love
the fact that I’m in a top-ﬂight col-
lege. Ultimately, I’d rather I gradu-
ate from a top-ﬂight college than
get a really good tan.

Ruscio’s plan for changing
Spring Term will give the school
the ability to not only remain atop-
ﬂight school but also climb even
higher in prominence. Ruscio calls
it being able to lead the conversa-
tion in higher education; the stu-
dents should call it better jobs for
graduating from a better school.

I’m a bit afraid I sound like I’m
the administration’s patsy; Lord
knows I’d rather not. But this time
I think they’ve proposed a policy
which will improve all of our lives.
Graduation will become easier
while at the same time the school’s

. quality of education will rise. Pro-

fessors will have more time to do
what they do best—teach. Students
will have more time in the Spring
to relax while truly focusing on an
interesting class.

It’s stating the obvious if you re-
ally think about it—President Rus-
cio is on to something.

Where were you Friday night? This past
Friday Pi Beta Phi and Phi Beta Sigma host-
ed a rockin’ dance party in the Commons.
Proceeds from the Dance-a-thon are going
towards the sponsorship of March of Dimes,
which deals with infant mortality, and vari-
ous local literacy projects. The Dance-a-thon
was particularly signiﬁcant because accord-
ing to one of the event organizers, “It is mon-
umental to have a historically black fraternity
joined with a pan-Hellenic sorority.”

This cooperation between traditionally
distinct alcoves of the Greek world surely
indicates both changes in the perceptions of
our students and the strong sense of general
community here at W&L.

What was the big deal at the dance? The
dance featured a six hour long, non-stop
danceoff, basically a dance till you drop bo-

nanza. Also included in the night’s activities
were raﬂies, dance prizes and special deals
with local restaurants and businesses. The or-
ganizers of the event feel that they were able
to bring the entire community together for
this event. Everyone from the siblings of vis-
iting students to Lexington shopkeepers got
involved. This event not only strengthened
the W&L community, but it also reinforced
our relationships with the area and the com-
munity of Lexington as well. We were able to
give back to the people who have so kindly
accepted us into their hometown through the
two philanthropic fundraisers; the people of
Lexington have been able to get involved in
a fun school activity. Since a good commu-
nity is one of the foundations of this school,
events like the Dance-a-thon are critical.

As one of the event organizers put it, “Ev-
eryone likes to dance!” Friday night was a
great time to boogey.

Women cruise to
sh utout victories

Defense allows just seven shots against Bridgewater
and Emory & Henry in ODAC matches this week

MICHAEL KEENAN / Sports Editor

Junior Katie Kern finds the back of the net during Wednesday's 5-0 win over Bridge-
water. Kern, who missed most of last season due to injury, has scored four goals In
the team's ﬂrst nine games.

By Hank Nathan
sun warren

The Washington and Lee women’s soccer team
rebounded in a big way this week.

After losing to conference-rival Virginia Wesley-
an, the Generals took out their frustration on confer-
ence opponents Bridgewater College and Emory &
Henry College.

“We knew after the loss on Saturday that we
needed to step it up this week,” said Katie Kern.
“We weren’t sure what to think about Bridgewa-
ter coming in, and we were missing some key for-
wards, so we knew that everyone was going to have
to work hard for each other.”

And the team did just that. Without team captain
and leading goal scorer Anne Van Devender, who
was out with an injury, the Generals focused on a
more team—oriented game.

From the outset against Bridgewater, W&L em-
ployed its aggressive style offense. Within the ﬁrst
two minutes of the game, the Generals narrowly
missed a goal after hitting the crossbar. Then, a few
minutes later, Haley Bunting put the ball in the back
of the net, only to have it taken away because of
an offside call. Moments aﬁer, Bunting received an-
other opportunity in a one-on-one situation with the
Bridgewater goalie, but the shot was just high.

Finally, 25 minutes into the game, W&L ended
its scoring drought. Kern ﬁred a shot into the leﬁ
side of the net off of a perfectly placed pass by de-
fender Marisa Van Brunt who was near midﬁeld.

“Marisa played a great ball across into the gap,
and I ran onto it, took a touch, and ﬁnished it,” said
Kern of the sequence that led to the goal.

Sixteen minutes later, at 41:21, Taylor Garrett,
from midﬁeld, headed the ball down the middle of
the ﬁeld to a seemingly wide open Martha Caulkins.
Caulkins broke away from the defense and shot the
ball just past the outstretched arms of the Eagles
goalie and into the right side of the net, advancing
the score to 2-0.

Even though they were ahead, W&L still strug-
gled to distance themselves from Bridgewater in the
ﬂrst half. However, the Generals opened the ﬂood
gates at the beginning of the second half, scoring
two quick goals, effectively putting the game out of
the Eagles’ reach.

Karen Lambdin scored off of a cross from Roz
Klann at 49:20, and Caulkins put in another goal off
of a deflection by a defender at 54:49.

Kern added in her second goal from a feed by
Caulkins as Bridgewater failed to clear the ball with
less than 10 minutes to play. The ﬁnal score was
5-0.

“We rebounded pretty well after the loss on Sat-
urday,” Kem stated after the 5-0 victory. “We just
have to keep working hard for each other and play
our game and we’ll be successful.”

W&L carried momentum into its next game at
Emory & Henry College on Saturday.

Van Brunt opened the scoring after putting in a
goal off of an assist by Bunting just four minutes
into the game (3:38). Ten minutes later, the same
combination hooked up again for another goal. This
ignited three more goals which were scored in a
span of 15 minutes, giving the Generals a 5-0 half-
time lead.

In the second half, the team added two more
goals, and the ﬁnal score was 7-0.

In the effort, Van Brunt and Klann each scored
two goals, while Bunting, Kern and Lambdin each
added one.

W&L compiled 32 shots compared to two by
the Wasps. Moreover, Emory & Henry did not even
have a single shot on target which was a testament
to the Generals’ stiﬂing defense.

W&L is now 7-2 overall and 5-1 in conference
through the halfway point of the season.

“We have made good progress from the ﬁrst
game of the season,” said Coach Neil Cunningham.
“Players have been very open to changes of forma-
tions and positions and have adapted well.”

hard not to get choked up think-
ing about just what Favre was
going through and how he over-
came such circumstances. Other
misfortunes that Favre had to
overcome included his wife,
Deanna, being diagnosed with
breast cancer in 2004 as well as
the physical injuries such as bro-
ken ﬁngers, sprained ankles," and
the everyday bruises and abuse
that comes with the punishment
of being an NFL quarterback.
Yet throughout all of the adver-
sity that Brett Favre has had to
face, he still continues to play
week-in and week-out, perform-
ing with the best the NFL has
to offer at a caliber that most
professional athletes couldn’t
dream of achieving.

Although in recent years
past, the critics have become
quite vocal and numerous in
calling for F avre to hang up his
cleats, saying that his time had
passed, nevertheless, this year
Green Bay is a perfect 4-0, sit-
ting in ﬁrst place in the NFC
North, thanks in large part to
Brett Favre’s management of
the game. However, the way
Favre manages the game hasn’t
changed the way, certain_.ana-

Green Bay Packers quar-
terback Brett Favre has broken
Hall of Fame quarterback Dan
Marino’s record for touchdown
passes over the course of a ca-
reer this Sunday in Minnesota.

. Going into week 4 against the
Vikings, Favre had thrown for
420 TD’s and started in an NFL-
record 240 consecutive games
by a quarterback. Now, F avre
stands alone atop one of the
most prestigious records in the
modern day NFL.

Drafted out of the University
of Southern Mississippi in 1991
by the Atlanta Falcons, Brett Fa-
vre had a rough start to his jour-
ney in the NFL which led him to
be traded to the Green Bay Pack-
ers in February of 1992. After

“ three weeks in which in he saw
minimal but meaningful play-
ing time, in week 4 of the 1992
NFL season Packers coach Mike
Holmgren decided to start F avre
in place of then injured quarter-
back Don Majkowski. Little did
we know that over the next 15
years Brett Favre would become
one of the best quarterbacks in
the history of the NFL. During
his time in Green Bay, Favre has
won a Super Bowl, been named
the Most Valuable Player of the
NFL three consecutive times—a

‘ feat that no one has matched-
-and has become the all-time
winningest QB in NFL history,
notching 150 wins in his regular
season career and counting.

However, amidst all the ac-
colades and formal recognitions
that F avre has received, he is
probably most well known for
his passion for the game, his
charismatic leadership, indomi-

Q table will, and overall heart that
he demonstratesreach anekevery
time he steps onto t.l=re'ﬁeld, re-

game with the kids in the neigh-
borhood in his backyard. There
was something so sincere and so
genuine about him that I knew
that I was witnessing something
special.

Fast forward to the present
and Favre has just broken one of
the most hallowed records in the
history of the NFL. He is with-
out a doubt a future, ﬁrst ballot
Hall of Famer that has made
his way into the hearts of foot-
ball fans across the country and
must seriously be considered in
the debate of the greatest NFL
quarterbacks ever. And although
years from now Peyton Man-
ning may break Favre’s record
and rewrite the history books on
his own, Favre will be forever
remembered for the many gut-
wrenching moments in which he
overcame all the odds with his
immensely strong will and heart
,agt_l\._ unadulterated love for. the
 Tru"ﬂifully, 1 dovnjtjﬂiink

Kat Telfeyan leads the cross country team as it beats four

D—I teams; men get revenge on ODAC rival Lynchburg

By Kevln corn
smrr wmnzn

The Cross Country teams had
a busy week as the women com-
peted at the William and Mary
Invitational on Saturday, while
the men were at the Lehigh Paul
Short Invitational on Friday and
the VMI Invitational on Saturday.
The women took sixth out of ten
Division I teams, holding their
own as the only Division 111 team
present. The men took ninth out
thirty—nine teams at the Paul Short
Invite and lost by only one point
to VMI at the VMI Invite.

At the William and Mary In-
vitational, the women were once
again led by sophomore Kat Telf-
eyan who ran in 23:34 to take for-
ty-third out of 103 runners. Junior
Becca Taylor took sixtieth with
a time of 24:23. Finishing just
behind her in sixty-second was
sophomore Dorothy Todd, who
ran in a time of 24:28. Freshmen
Christine Balisterri and Katherine
Fenwick took sixty-ﬁfth and sev-
enty—ﬁfth respectively with times
of 24:41 and 25:31.

This meet was especially im-
portant since it gave the women
a look at the Regionals course.
Todd commented, “We were able
to familiarize ourselves with the
course so that when Regionals
rolls around, we will know what
to expect. Everyone on the team
really seemed to enjoy the course;
it was a great combination of roll-
ing hills, open ﬁelds, and wooded
trails.”

Furthermore, the women were
competing amongst SEC and
ACC schools. “It was a nice pre-
view of the course, and the large
‘ﬁeld of competitors made us not
only push ourselves but get ready

for the competition at regionals.
I was very proud of the team.
We’ve been training hard these
past weeks, and jumping in the
race with some big name schools
gave us some good experience,”
stated Telfeyan. Todd added,
“The ﬁeld was entirely Division I
with the exception of us, so there
were very fast girls in our race
that pushed the pace and pulled
us along. Being able to hold our
own against teams from the ACC
and SEC is exciting, so as a team,
we were very happy with our 6th
place ﬁnish.”

The men meanwhile took care
of business while at the Paul Short
Invite by outrunning Lynchburg.
Junior Michael Welsh led the
team by ﬁnishing thirteenth with
a time of 26:24, while senior Tom
Brower completed the race in a
time of 26:59 to take thirty-sixth.

Juniors Vance Berry and An-
thony Ives crossed the ﬁnish
line in forty-third with a time of
27:11 and sixty-eighth in a time
of 27:38, respectively. Lastly,
freshman Michael Shiplett took
106*‘ with at time of 28:05, senior
Andrew Friski ﬁnished in a time
of 28:16 to take 116“‘, and sopho-
more Ben Stutts ﬁnished 164"‘ in a
time of28:5l.

“Placing ninth was great, but
it wasn’t particularly signiﬁcant.
What really mattered was beat-
ing Lynchburg by 97 points and
Mary Washington by 115. We’ve
obviously taken a big step in ﬁt-
ness since NYU, and we’re glad
to see that paying off’ commented
Brower. Berry added, “We bested
ODAC rival Lynchburg by a sig-
niﬁcant margin, showing a marked
improvement from our last outing
at NYU where they got the better

of us. It’s been a hotly contested
rivalry this year, with the better
prepared team winning each out-
ing. We’ll look to hold this mo-
mentum through the ODAC meet
in four weeks.”

Also worth noting was Ives’s
breakthrough this week. Brower

mentioned that Ives “had the kind ,

of race which we need him to run
as our No. 4, plus the 29 second
PR (personal record) was pretty‘
incredible.”

Lastly, while at the VMI In-
vite, ran well with great efforts
from freshmen Jack Ivy, Robert
George, and David Doobin, soph-
omore Elliot O’Brien, and junior
Alex Jackson. Doobin commented
on the Generals’ ﬁnishes, “A lot of
us felt like our performance. . .was
exactly what we have been train-
ing for thus far this season, and
that if we can keep on performing
at that caliber for the remainder
of the season it bodes well. To
nearly beat VMI was largely un-
expected, and a pleasant surprise,
but it was never really our goal.
We just wanted to reach our rac-
ing potential and we thought that
VMI would be way out in front of
us.”

The meet was also fun for the
participants because those not
running cheered on their team-
mates with entertaining signs,
such as “go elliott, ﬂy like a kiwi,”
a phrase that can be attributed to
freshman Davis Franklin. O’Brien
reported the race was even started
with a cannon.

The men will next be in action
October 13 as they participate in
the William & Mary Invitational,
while the women will compete

the same day at the DeSa1es Invi-.

tational.

FH hangs on for win

Womenlopen ODAC schedule with win over Randolph-Macon

By Michael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

After losing a double overtime heart-
break to No. 11 Johns-Hopkins University
last Sunday, the Generals began confer-
ence play Friday night by defeating Ran-
dolph-Macon College 3-2 on Friday night

in a hard-fought game.

s°°'°s In the preseason ODAC
w&l_ 3 coaches poll, the Generals
R_MC 2. ranked second to Lynch-

burg by just one ﬁrst-place

vote. R-MC entered the
season ranked a distant fourth. For the
ﬁrst few minutes of Friday night’s game,
it appeared the rankings should have been
reversed.

R-MC got off to a quick start when
freshmen Mary McCarthy scored an unas-
sisted goal less than three minutes into the
game, causing an eruption of cheers and
optimism from the visitor’s bench.

“They were ready for this game and
really wanted it badly,” said senior Laura
Nugent. “They were absolutely intent on
beating us.”

“Their ﬁrst goal was a wake-up call,”
said sophomore Caroline Habliston.

It didn’t take long for the Generals to
wake up, though. Just 76 seconds later ju-
nior Liz Garson tied the game, ripping a
shot past R-MC goalie Ashley Crouch off
a penalty comer.

‘‘It was surprising that R-MC scored
quickly, but we didn’t let that get us
down,” said sophomore Sallie Armstrong.
“We responded quickly with Liz Garson’s
goal which was so important to keep us
from playing frantic and on our heels.”

“[Responding with a goal so quickly]
was necessary to show that we were actu-

ally in this game and to prove to ourselves
that we could reorganize and get ourselves
into the game,” said Nugent. “We were ex-
cited about the game, but it seems like we
weren’t totally ready to win and ﬁght for
a victory.”

Ten minutes later the Generals found
back of the net off another penalty comer.
This time it was Armstrong taking a quick
shot off the short pass. Less than three
minutes later, Armstrong took advantage
of another penalty corner to score her sec-
ond goal of the night.

“We have been very focused on [pen-
alty comers in practice],” said Nugent.
“The stoppers have been taking at least
10-20 stops a day, and Sally and Liz have

“[The goal] was shocking, to be hon-
est,” said Nugent. “We just weren’t play-
ing our game.”

Though the Yellow Jackets would
mount several more offensive opportuni-
ties, the Generals defense held strong. Ha-
bliston, in goal for the second half, came
up with three bigsaves to preserve the 3-2
lead and give the Generals the victory in
their ﬁrst ODAC contest of the "season.

“I thought that R-MC played really
well Friday night,” said Armstrong. “They
lived up to my expectations and maybe
played a little better like they wanted it
more than we did.”

The Generals return to action on Tues-
day evening when they travel to Eastern

“We have been very focused on [penalty corners in prac-

tice]. T he stoppers have been taking at least 10-20 stops a

day, and Sally and Liz have been perfecting their hits. Its

drills pay oﬂ"/ ”

The Yellow Jackets mounted an offen-
sive surge with about ten minutes to play,
winning several penalty comers, but the
Generals’ defense refused to budge and
took a 3-1 lead into halftime.

Less than 10 minutes into the second
half, R-MC’s Nicole Klee scored off a
penalty comer to bring the Yellow Jackets
within one.

Mennonite to take on the Royals, who
were picked third in the preseason poll
and have already defeated Lynchburg and
Virginia Wesleyan in conference play.

“EMU is our biggest game in the near
future since they eliminated us from the
ODAC tournament last year and have al-
ready won against No. 1 Lynchburg this
year,” said Habliston. “We have very
similar styles of play and will approach
the game with composure and looking for
payback.”

Yellow Jackets sting Generals 42-17

After a closeﬁrst half Randolph-Macon destroys W&L in second half

By Brian Devlne
STAFF WRITER

Last season, Washington and Lee foot-
ball enjoyed a good degree of success,
winning the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference and restoring a sense of worth to a
program that had been off W&L students’
collective radar for several decades.

This season, the Generals notched two
impressive, hard-fought out-of-conference
victories and looked to be on course to a
repeat ODAC title.

On Saturday afternoon, in suburban
Richmond, the wheels came off. The boys
in blue fell 42-17 to a surprisingly strong
Randolph-Macon squad picked to ﬁnish
last in the conference before the season
began.

The Generals had only themselves to
blame as they committed six turnovers and
gave up 30 unanswered points.

The game started inauspiciously when
the host Yellow Jackets scored a touch-
down less than two minutes into the con-
test. The ﬁrst half was a competitive affair
where each team scored two touchdowns.
W&L’s Torn Pacicco had both for the visi-
tors on 1- and 2- yard runs and R-MC add-
ed to their early lead with a 79-yard kick
return by Waddell Howard after Pacicco’s
ﬁrst. Pacicco nearly added a third but fum-

bled the football only one yard from the
end zone to put an end to an impressive
16-play, 90-yard drive.

The score at halftime was the exact
same as in last week’s game against Aver-
ett, 15-14, after a R-MC ﬁeld goal. From
there on, though, the aftemoon’s affair di-
verged remarkably from its predecessor.
R-MC kicked off to start the second half,
but the ball was fumbled by W&L’s Aaron
Fulk and was recovered by R-MC’s Tristan
Carr. The Jackets capitalized on the error
with a touchdown pass from Brandon Bra-
ner to tight end Stuart May. W&L punted
on its next possession and then gave up an-
other touchdown to go down 14-28.

Still within reach at the start of the
fourth quarter, W&L quarterback R.J. Var-
ner fumbled at his own 5-yard line under
pressure on the ﬁrst play of the ﬁnal pe-
riod. The ball was recovered by R-MC’s
Ray Johnson in the end zone to put the
hosts up 35-14.

From there, Vamer’s afternoon only got
worse. He was intercepted on the ﬁrst play
of the next possession and it took Braner
only two plays to put his team up 42-14.
Chris Prugar tackled Rod Nelson on the
one-yard line to save a touchdown, only
to see Zak Thornton rush for his third of
the day on the very next snap. Vamer then
threw his third interception just three plays

into the next possession though R-MC was
forced to punt. Vamer was replaced by
freshman Patrick Rouse for the next series,
who led the Generals to their ﬁnal points,
a ﬁeld goal by Andrew Wilbourn to make
the ﬁnal score 42-17.

Vamer was candid about his 8-for-
15, 59-yard afternoon. “We got our butts
kicked,” he said plainly. There were few
bright spots for the Generals, though
Pacicco had over 100 yards rushing for the
third straight game and safety Kyle Luby
again led the team in tackles with nine.

The Blue Menace defense proved al-
most entirely unable to stop the Yellow
Jacket offense, who punted only ﬁve times
in the game. R-MC’s Thornton (22 rush,
89 yards) and Braner (10-17, 118 yards, 1
TD) have proven to be one of the better
RB—QB pairings in the conference. Their
preseason ranking, seventh, was clearly
too low, as the Jackets are now 4-1 and un-
defeated in conference play. They had not
won four games in a season since 2003.

Unless the Generals can correct the
widespread mistakes that plagued them on
Saturday, their preseason ranking, second,
may have been too optimistic. The Blue
and White will need to commit far fewer
turnovers if they hope to win the confer-
ence again, as many of their newfound
fans expect them to do.
