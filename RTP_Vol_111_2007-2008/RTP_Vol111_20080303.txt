Things change but stay the same

Fidei Castro may have stepped down from the cu ban presidency after forty years
in power. But Abel Delgado says that nothing will really change until both Castro
brothers are out of the picture. ‘

heat in ongoing
investigation

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

A candidate for the prestigious Johnson Schol-
arship was hospitalized Tuesday night after at-
tending an oﬁlcampus party hosted by Phi Kappa
Psi at Fallout, a house some of their members rent
on Washington Street.

The student was staying with a freshman new
member of the fraternity.

Erin Hutchinson, the senior assistant director
of admissions and the coordinator of the Johnson
Scholarship program, refused to comment on what
she said was an ongoing investigation. Before the

V candidates arrived on campus, Hutchinson had
told current students that candidates could lose_

their offers of admission if they got into trouble
while in Lexington. She would not say whether
or not this particular student would be admitted.

The high school senior was considering swim-
ming for Washington and Lee. Men’s swimming
coach Joel Shinoﬁeld conﬁrmed that the student
was staying with a freshman member of the s /lI1'1
team during his visit.

According to one team member, Shinoﬁeld
—- a W&L alumnus who graduated in 1994 — has
told members of his team that they are allowed
to take recruits out to parties during their Visits.
However, Shinoﬁeld has told his team that it is
unacceptable for students to give the recruits the
impression that they are allowed to drink while
visiting campus. ‘

The party, billed by one member as the frater-
nity’s annual honor scholar tequila party, has been
occurring during scholarship visits for several
years.’ _

Chris Womom, President of the Interfratemity
Council, said he and other members of the group
would be looking into the party in the near future.
He said that off-campus parties lie on the border
of the council’s jurisdiction.

“lt’s outside our jurisdiction if we want it to
be, but we can take action,” Wornom said. “We
could do it or someone else will.”

Womom said it was too early to tell if the in-
vestigation would center on individual members
or the entire fraternity.

After years of research, plan-
ning and discussion, Washington
and Lee will ﬁnally welcome a
sixth sorority, Alpha Delta Pi, to
campus. Receiving the greatest
number of votes from current so-
rority women, ADPi trumped Phi
Mu and Delta Delta Delta, two
other candidate sororities chosen
by W&L for their solid national
reputations and strong values.

The first sorority extension in
2005 was unsuccessful. It is now
being implemented as part of the
W&L Strategic Plan, which was
approved with the inclusion of a
sixth sorority house, the previous
cause for contention.

Dana Smith, the assistant direc-
tor of student activities'and Greek
life, said, “ADPi showed values
congruent with W&L: a commit-
ment to compliment the current
sorority community, local alumni
and collegiate support and, a thor-
ough plan for colonization.”

Starting this fall, ADPi will
make a presence at major Greek
events in hopes of building a suc-
cessful new member class come
recruitment time. Smith said
ADPi will have a leadership con-
sultant visit the campus throughout
the fall to ensure that information
about the organization is present
at all major Greek Life events in-
cluding Meet the Greeks events,
Homecoming and philanthropy
events.

Tiffany Eisenbise, the Cam-
pus Services Manager of ADPi’s
Nationals, said, “We are eager
to start the colonization process,
where a supportive combination

of dedicated alumnae, collegians
and Alpha Delta Pi staff will edu-
cate students about the unique op-
portunity to be a founding member
of a well-respected international
organization and recruit female
students who exemplify our core
values of excellence in scholar-
ship, leadership, service to others
and sisterhood.” ’

In January 2009, ADPi will join

and hopeful that ADPi

ment. ”

the existing ﬁve sororities during
formal recruitment.

_ Smith added, “Representatives
from [ADPi’s] national organiza-
tion and potentially local colle-
gians will host recruitment events
in the same manner as the chapters
on campus. They will work with
Panhellenic to determine the most
suitable location for hosting these
events — a space on campus com-
parable to the size of the rooms in
the chapter houses.”

During formal recruitment
ADPi will have the opportunity to
offer up to 70 bids to establish its
colony on campus. As a result, the
other chapters’ quotas will be de-
creased from previous years in an
effort to support ADPi. Of course,
this is appropriate since the driving
force behind extension has been to

create smaller, more cohesive new
member classes and chapter bod-
ies.

The University is committed to
building a sorority house of simi-
lar design and square footage for
ADPi, which will be located to the
left of Kappa Kappa. Gamma on
sorority row. This construction is
anticipated for completion no lat-
ter than Fall 2011, although a deﬁ-
nite construction time line has yet
to be established.

While identical on the outside,
ADPi’s house will feature slight
changes to the layout of the third
floor, which will accommodate a
more strategically-located laun-
dry room and provide residential
space for 20 women. In addition,
the projected completion date will
allow the founding members to
personalize the interior space and
experience life in the house before
graduation.

Until then, new members of
ADPi will work with the Panhel-
lenic Council and the University
in ﬁnding a suitable solution for
meetings, meal plan administra-
tion and housing. It has been pro-
posed that new members could
meet regularly in one of the rooms
in the Commons and live in groups
in either Gaines Hall or the Woods
Creek Apartments.

Smith emphasized that the
playing ﬁeld for recruitment will
be equalized as much as possible.

“Panhellenic will continue to
work closely with ADPi and the
sororities on campus throughout
the spring and fall to ensure fair-
ness and understanding of the ex-
tension process,” Smith said.

Lauren Ottaway, former exten-
sion chair of the Panhellenic Coun-

oil, was responsible for sending
out the notice to all National Pan-
hellenic organizations advertising
that W&L was open for extension
in July 2007. She also worked
with the three candidate sororities
throughout their presentations to
the University and facilitated the
voting process.

“Panhellenic is very pleased
with the results,” she said. “We
had three strong sororities and
three strong choices, so the result
could not have been problematic.
We are all very excited and hope-
ful that ADPi will be successful
and have a good recruitment.”

Moreover, Ottaway believes
the addition of ADPi will ben-
eﬁt W&L’s Greek community im-
mensely. She said, “The new so-
rority will provide another option
for women who did not feel that
any of the existing sororities ﬁt ex-
actly what they were looking for.
Also, it will reduce the sizes of the
chapters, which is crucial.”

Currently, the average chapter
size is greater than 100 women.
This puts stress on dining and
meeting spaces within the soror-
ity houses, which were built for
80-90 members. In addition, the
large chapter sizes are also not re-
ﬂective of the small, community
atmosphere that many students en-
joy at W&L. It is hoped that the
addition of ADPi will ameliorate
this situation.

Smith is similarly optimistic.
She said, “This is a very exciting
opportunity for the sorority com-
munity to expand and grow. We
look forward to welcoming Alpha
Delta Pi to Washington and Lee.”

Anthony Zinni will share his

experience dealingwith foreign

By Wes O’DelI
STAFF WRITER

Former four-Star Marine General and
CENTCOM Commander Anthony Zinni
will speak in Lee Chapel on Thursday,
March 6 at 7:30.

Zinni, a decorated ofﬁcer who at one
time commanded all US. forces in the
Persian Gulf, was invited by the Con-
tact Committee to be the fourth and ﬁnal
speaker in their Spotlight on the Middle
East series.

According to Contact Co-Chair Neil
Sheaffer, “At the beginning of the year,
the committee decided to put together a
series of speakers about the Middle East,
which is obviously a very relevant topic
these days, and has been for a number of
years now. We have had speakers about
diplomacy, culture, and religion»-and we
wanted to touch upon the current military
issues in the region as well.”

General Zinni’s career has taken him
to over 70 different countries, including
combat service in Vietnam, Somalia and
Iraq.

The general has received a great deal
of media attention for his early opposi-

tion to the Iraq War, particularly the post-
battle occupation strategy. Said Sheaffer:
“He should also bring an interesting per-
spective as he has been a vocal critic of
the Bush administration and the decision
to invade Iraq.”

Logan Gibson, Contact’s other Co-
Chair, said Zinni has also been mentioned
as a possible Vice Presidential candidate
for Illinois Sen. Barack Obama.

“There are few topics that are more
relevant to all Americans right now than
the war,” he added. A

Zinni also has ‘a Lexington connec-
tion: he has lectured at over 50 universi-
ties, including a period as a professor of
International Studies at VMI.

Sheaffer believes Zinni will be a “per—
fect speaker...he is very knowledgeable
about the topic and the region.”

The general will also address the
Weapons of Mass Destruction class at 4
p.m. Thursday. The talk will be in Com-
mons room 345.

The Lee Chapel talk will be followed
by a reception at the Alumni House.

W&L gathers to ‘Take Back the Night”  

Sexual assault victim shares her experience in hopes of spreading awareness

By Dane Davls
surr wmrrn

In order to raise awareness
about sexual assault victimizing
women on campus and through-
out the world, W&L held a ‘Take
Back the Night’ rally last Thurs-
day in Cohen Amphitheater. The
vigil, organized by SPEAK and
Dr. Jennifer Sayre of University
Counseling Service, included a
speaker in Stackhouse Theater
and personal testimonies of sex-
ual violence.

The night began with a talk
by Dr. Michael Kimmel in
Stackhouse Theater, entitled
‘“Mars and Venus,’ or Planet
Earth: Women and Men on
Campus in a New Millennium.”
As an expert on masculinity, Dr.
Kimmel explained the complex
social interactions that charac-
terize college campuses across
the country. Highlighting the
rapidly—changing state of gen-
der relations around the world,
Dr. Kimmel described how nu-
merous problems and issues
facing the sexes can be resolved
through dialogue and coopera-
tion.

The event then moved out-

side to the Cohen Amphitheater,
where a candlelight vigil was
held to shed light on sexual as-

sault. Dr. Jennifer Sayre, one
of the main event organizers,
opened with statistics about sex-
ual assault on college campuses
nationally. The facts alone,
however, were unable to con-
vey the immense personal and
psychological effects resulting
from sexual victimization.

One W&L student gave her
account of being sexual assault-

ress.”

‘Take Back the Night’ is a
nationally-recognized event,
originating in 1977. The term
“Take Back the Night” began as
a memorial read by Anne Pride
at an anti-violence rally. Since
then, thousands of marches
and vigils have been held in
the United States and across
the world. While each rally is

ed, forcing attendees to reﬂect
on the grave state of gender re-
lations at the university. Attend-
ees then lit candles and marched
through campus as a visible sign
of support for victims of sexual
assault.

“It is important for our cam-
pus,” said senior Paten Hughes,
president of SPEAK. “It used to
be that you couldn’t talk about
sexual assault in a safe way...
but now we are making prog-

 
 

unique to the community host-
ing it, most share accounts by
individuals who have been vic-
tims of sexual violence. Accord-
ing to the organization that initi-
ated ‘Take Back the Night,’ the
common theme is “the assertion
that all human" beings have the
right to be free from violence,
the right to be heard, and the
right to reclaim those rights if
they are violated.

With the Washington and

‘»._.r~_i ‘ 3 '. »~ ‘ .2

Lee’s above-average rankings
in sexual assault and rape, the
rally was especially relevant.
The rally brought diverse el-
ements of the community to
together in order to break the
silence’ on the problems facing
women here on campus. As the
school engages in frank discus-
sions about its culture and the
interactions between men and
women on campus, ‘Take Back
the Night’ helped students and
faculty explore and understand
the complex and troubling issue
of sexual assault.

Charles Heaps III, a sopho-
more and attendee said, ‘‘I found
the event moving and eye-open-
ing on the trouble and problems
that plague our campus. As a
student, the speaker brought
into focus the disheartening re-
ality of sexual assault on this
campus. However, being a part
of such a moving event with stu-
dents and faculty gives me hope
that change will come.”

“I was excited about how it
went,” said Hughes. “I was im-
pressed with the turnout.”

Take Back the Night’ will
likely be one event among many

as the university continues to '

ﬁnd solutions for the problems

on campus.

. Castro as the ultimate puppeteer

ACastro by any other name is still a Castro; out of sight but not out of mind

 

 

 

By Abel Delgado
STAFF WRITER

It wasn’t supposed to end this
way. The cruel dictator who out-
lasted nine U.S. presidents was
supposed to'be deposed, rot in a
Hague prison, or._at least die in
power, leaving his hypocrisy of a
revolution in shambles.

Instead, Fidel Castro once
again outwitted us all, resigning
as President of the Cold War relic
and tropical gulag we call Cuba
and paving the way for his brother
and others to cement their power
before his death.

No one thought Castro would
ever voluntarily give up power.
Few realize he still hasn’t.

Castro fooled the entire world
yet again. His resignation as the
Cuban Head of State is seen as
a chance for change in a country
that has been under his control for

nearly 50 years.

World leaders expressed hope
that Raul Castro, Fidel’s pur-
portedly more practical and less
adored younger brother, would
loosen up the archaic economic
policies that have left Cuba in
poverty.

While some on the left made
sure to compliment the older Cas-
tro’s rule, leaders from all over the
political spectrum suggested now
would be a good time for Cuba
to release its political prisoners.
Many Cubans on the island were
expecting a new generation of
government leaders to take over.

All wondered what a Raul
Castro Regime would mean. We
won’t ﬁnd out soon. _

While Fidel Castro did resign
from two of his three posts, the
one he didn’t resign from, Head
of the Communist Party, is the
most powerful and inﬂuential, ac-

cording to the Communist Consti-
tution.

Raul Castro’s ﬁrst act as the
nation’s “leader” was to ask the
rubber stamp of a parliament per-
mission to consult with his older

los Lague Davila, a prominent
younger politician who was part-
ly responsible for the economic
reforms that saved the Cuban
economy from utter obliteration
once the Soviet Union fell, Raul

brother on all decisions involv-
ing “defense, foreign policy, and
socioeconomic development,”
meaning basically anything that
matters. Of course, the parlia-
ment agreed.

Instead of choosing Car-

and Parliament chose J osé Ramon
Machado Ventura, a 76-year-old
member of the old guard known
as “Communist Hardliner” to be
First Vice President.

The decision even dismayed
young Castro supporters who

were told their generation would
begin to have a say.

The vice presidential choice
discredits any hope of economic
reform on the island, and those
who think Human Rights would
begin to be respected under Raul
Castro are either grossly unaware
of his record as Defense Minister
or just plain fooling themselves.

Just ask the men, women and
children of the Cambio Movement
(Spanish for change) who have
been arrested, interrogated and
beaten simply for wearing white
wristbands that say “change” on
them.

In Raul Castro’s Cuba a wrist-
band is reason enough to be beat
by state police while in a local
church. So what’s the change
between Raul and Fidel’s Cuba?
Nothing. '

There is no change because it
is still F idel’s Cuba. Raul is unbe-

lievably loyal to his brother and
knows full well that he is nothing
without him.

The Communist Party knows
that without F ide1’s charisma and
appeal to ignorant “cappuccino-
communists,” they have no stand-
ing both abroad and at home.

And we all should have been
wise enough to know the Fidel
Castro’s ego is much too large to
be hampered by a life-threatening
disease.

So they played a game with
us.

They led us to believe some-
one else was pulling the strings.

Meanwhile, the puppet master
lies in bed, in pain but with a smile
on his face, knowing full well he
has tricked the world into think-
ing his reign is over, and knowing
full ‘well that couldn’t be further
from the truth.

Secret to sucess: whatever it takes

Nabor is Alternative Feb Break trip to a prep school focuses on minority students entering college

By Jess Stelnmetz
STAFF WRITER

While most Washington and
Lee students were going to Flori-
da or hanging out with high school
friends at home over February
break, 12 students volunteered at
YES Prep in Houston.

We had the opportunity to
work with students in three dif-
ferent campuses and see why so
many in Houston rave about YES
Prep.

YES Prep is a charter school
that primarily serves minority 6-
12 grade students from economi-
cally disadvantaged backgrounds.
Eighty-eight of the students are
ﬁrst-generation college—bound
and nearly all are at least one
grade level behind.

The typical YES Prep student
is one that most public schools

fail to properly educate.

The success of YES Prep is as-
tounding. YES Prep’s goal is for
all graduating seniors to be ac-
cepted to a four-year college.

The statistics of their alumni
show that YES Prep is clearly on
the right track: 90 percent of YES
alumni have either graduated or
are still enrolled in college.

This can be compared to the
national average of 50 percent for
all ethnic groups and a discour-
aging 22 percent for low-income
students.

How is YES Prep so success-
ful? After a week at one of the
campuses, my best summary is
their motto: “Whatever It Takes.”

At the beginning of each year,
all teachers, parents and staff sign
a contract that they will do what-
ever it takes to meet the YES mis-

sion of collegiate success.

The staff holds high expecta-
tions for their students and gives
them every opportunity to be suc-
cessful.

Not only is the school day
longer than normal, but there is

‘ who need help with homework.

The entire YES experience fo-
cuses on college.

ter colleges attended by the teach-
ers. Teachers regularly discuss

Evi root of steroid abuse? $ Money $

Baseball is a business; fans wanting a cleaner sport can boycott for changes

By crlghton Allen
STAFF WRITER

I have read, discussed, and
heard far more about steroids in
baseball in the last few weeks of
my sports writing class than is
reasonable. It is my hope that this,
my ﬁnal opinion on the subject
for quite a while, will be cathartic,
purging me of the sick taste this
scandal has left in my mouth.

The crux of this discussion
rests on the question: why do
Roger Clemens and company risk
their careers and reputations by
cheating?

On a superficial level, it is
because they thought they would
never be found out. This belief is
a chief reason most people com-
mit illegal or unethical acts.

Do you think Bill Clinton
would have spent half his political
career playing footsie (and other
games) with interns if he knew it
would all blow up in his face and
land him on Capitol Hill in front
of a hostile Congressional Com-
mittee?

Of course not, and the same
is true with professional athletes
who use steroids.

Caught up in a desperate race
to make it in the league and pro-
long playing careers that their
bodies tell them are past their
prime, players turn to steroids and
HGH to give them a leg up on the
competition. ‘

Make no mistake about it, for
the 25 roster spots on every Major
League Baseball team, there are

literally hundreds of players ca-
pable of ﬁlling them out.

Think sorority rush is competi-
tive? That’s a Girl Scout meet-
ing compared to making it to the
show; several miles an hour dif-
ference on a fastball or ten feet
traveling distance on a long ﬂy-
ball can mean the difference be-
tween strikeouts and homeruns
and a roster spot, or meatballs and
flyouts and posting your resume
on Monster.com.

But blind arrogance and sheer
stupidity in thinking they won’t

hard to pass up if you knew a way
to bridge that gap? Yeah, I thought
so.

Really, isn’t this same sce-
nario why some college students
use prescription drugs such as
Adderal (without prescription)
to help them study during exam
time? It is really an easy conclu-
sion to reach: good grades=nice
job offer=fat salary.

reason athletes use steroids.

The main culprit behind the
cheating is the almighty dollar.

The last several generations
of young Americans have been
taught by mass media to worship
money and glorify its accumula-
tion.

The MLB league minimum
for a player on a roster for 2008
is $390,000. In comparison, the
average American worker makes
only $46,201.

Would the difference between
the two salaries, $343,799, be

lom-looking Commissioner Bud
Selig appears before the press and
reafﬁrms MLB’s commitment to
reform, baseball will not come
clean from steroids.

No, the game will not clean
itself up because baseball, when
played at the professional level, is
no longer the quaint Great Ameri-
can Pastime; it is a business and
everything that goes with it.

Owners of professional base-
ball clubs are not ﬁnancing a team
to provide the fans with entertain-
ment out of generosity; they treat
it as another business venture from

which to make a proﬁt. Owners
make most of their money from
ticket sales and there lies the key
to cleaning up the game.

Fans, by their refusal to go
watch baseball games in protest of
steroid abuse, can be an effective
force of change. We can effec-
tively hold MLB hostage. With-
out butts in seats, baseball can
generate little revenue and will be
forced to bow to our demands and
clean itself up.

It pains me to say,, so, but as
effective as a fan boycott can be,
fans are not going to totally clean
up an institution as massive as
MLB baseball.

Ultimately, every man must
make the choice of whether or not
to cheat in his own heart and live
the consequences. We can, how-
ever, play a large part in restoring
some of the lost luster to a game
that once helped give America its
national identity.

My little brother is ten years
old and plays baseball for a youth
team in our hometown and idol-
izes the Atlanta Braves’ players,
especially Chipper Jones. Yet,
maybe it should be the other way
around.

For baseball in its purest form,
the way it was meant to be played,

sional stadium; it is found on rec

GA and other small towns across
America, in the hearts of kids like

professional baseball.

ferent parts of the country. The
typical YES Prep graduate visits
colleges in California, Washing-
ton, D.C., West Texas and the
Midwest.

The students at YES Prep are
very privileged in that they are
given countless opportunities that
they would never otherwise even
dream of if they attended their
districted school.

Every day I volunteered at
YES Prep East End, at least a
dozen middle school students
would come up to me, shake my
hand and introduce themselves.

While I love my 6th graders
that I teach here in Lexington and
think the world of them, I would
be completely shocked if this hap-
pened to our volunteers.

YES Prep not only focuses on
academics but also on building

positive relationships and achiev-
ing social justice.

YES stands for “Youth En-
gaged in Service”. YES students
complete monthly service projects
and log hundreds of service hours
throughout their seven years.

In a country where schools
have continually failed minority
and economically disadvantaged
students, YES Prep is diminish-
ing the achievement gap and giv-
ing its students an opportunity to
be truly successful.

As the staff members continu-
ously remind their students, any
student, regardless of the color
of his or her skin or his or her
family’s educational or economic
background, can be successful
and graduate not only high school
but also college.

MISSION STATEMENT: it is the mission of THE
RING-TUM PHI to accurately, truthfully, and
thoroughly report news affecting the Washington
and Lee community for students, faculty,
parents and alumni. Our goal is to look deeper
into news affecting campus life and hold leaders
accountable. Through our reporting, we aspire
to spark discussions that lead to discovering

Wake-up call

Lecture discusses youth drinking

By Queenle Wong
STAFF WRITER

Young drinkers are more vulnerable to the effects of al-

I , A cohol and drugs than adults, a Duke University neuropsy-

chologist said to a packed Stackhouse Theater Tuesday.

Dr. Scott Swartzwelder, who wrote more than 100 sci-
entiﬁc papers and four books on the topic, discussed re-
search ﬁndings in rats and humans that showed alcohol
causes more damage to the developing brains of adoles-
cents.

“Our behavior has a lot to do with those critical ﬁnal
years of brain development,” Swartzwelder said in a Pow-
erpoint presentation.

Young drinkers are more sensitive to memory impair-
ment but less sensitive to the sedative effects of alcohol,
he said. This makes it easier for adolescents to drink ex-
cessively to the point of harm.

Swartzwelder’s study compared how alcohol consump-
tion affected the hippocampus of adolescent and adult rats,
a structure in the brain critical for learning and memoriza-
tion.

Alcohol damages the brain by disrupting synaptic plas-
ticity, the ability of two neurons to change in strength,
largely in the hippocampus, he said.

Researchers found that alcohol, which Swartzwelder
characterized as a “powerful drug,” impaired the ability
of younger rats to memorize maze patterns more severely
than adult rats.

Submerged in a tub of water, the rats were required to
locate a platform and swim to it. Researchers found that
adolescent rats under the inﬂuence of alcohol had more
trouble locating the platform than adult rats.

In another experiment at Duke University, Swartzweld-
er studied the effect of alcohol on 20 to 29-year-old stu-
dents. With a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08, students
in their early 20s had more difficulty memorizing patterns
than students in their late 20s.

Researchers found similar results in marijuana use, but
Swartzwelder did not discuss drug use as thoroughly be-
cause of the limited time of the lecture.

The audience also watched video clips from the com-
edy “Dude, Where’s my car?” and a commercial for Span-
ish sparkling water, which showed a man waking up with
multiple piercings after a blackout.

“We make a joke out of a very serious neurological
event” he said.

Despite lecturing to a college campus for the ﬁfth time
known for its heavy alcohol use, Swartzwelder empha-
sized at the beginning of the presentation that he was a _
scientist not a motivational speaker.

The point of the lecture was to provide students with
the information they need to make informed decisions
about alcohol and drug use, he said.

Residential Assistant Aaron Albert said that he thought
the speaker’s method was effective.

“I like that he presented the facts, as he said he was
a man of science not a man of agenda, which is good. If
[students] hear someone say don’t do drugs, drugs are bad,
[students] are not going to want to hear that message.”

Junior Erika Rost, a neuroscience major, agreed. She
said that the information was presented in a way that the
average student could understand.

“The lecture gave people more information that they
typically wouldn’t come across and it was deﬁnitely more

Battle of the Bands brings W&L musicians into the spotlight

By Michael Morella
surr wansn

F unk-rock band, the Lalai
Damas, beat out four other stu-
dent bands to win Washington
and Lee’s annual Battle of the
Bands in Doremus Gymnasium
Friday night. i

The winning group, composed
of juniors Keith Friend and Spen-
cer McElroy, sophomore Mal-
colm Hines, and freshman Robert
Wason, took home the $1,000 top
prize for this year’s event.

“I think everyone did an awe-
some job,” McElroy, the band’s
guitarist, said of all the evening’s
performers. “Quality over quan-
tity.”

He was particularly impressed
by the original songs each band
brought to their sets and that the

musicians were “bold enough” to

perform them.

“I think there should be more
stuff like this on campus,” he
said.

Hard rockers Agent Flynn
and folk-rock band Velva Bar
Lights each left with the second
and third place prizes, $500 and
$250, respectively. The other two
groups, the Southem-rockinfused
Two Dirt Road and six-piece folk
troop Rikki Tikki Tavi, complete
with mandolin and harmonica,
gave strong performances.

“It was just really great to be
singing in front of a crowd,” said
Julie Slonecki, singer, guitarist,
and pianist for Rikki Tikki Tavi.
“It was probably my biggest per-

formance.” Slonecki was the
lone woman amidst a host of
' male performers at the battle.
Bands performed sets of three
songs each, covering a vast array
of music from the more recent
Red Hot Chili Peppers and Out-
kast to classic rock standards by
the Rolling Stones and the Jimi
Hendrix Experience.

Performers were split onto“
stages at either end of the gym,
alternating their sets as fans shuf-
ﬂed back and forth to get the best
stage—side spots. ‘

“It’s really impressive that we

Stage presence also made a
difference  the quality of this
year’s battle. Fans were treated
to a wealth of jokes, epic gui-
tar solos, and even a little bit

of cowbell. An elaborately de-.

signed banner reading “Two Dirt
Road” fell as the band struck their
ﬁrst guitar chord. But the Lalai
Damas had their own key to suc-
cess: matching outﬁts.

Bands were judged on their
on-stage charisma, as well as a
combination of musicianship,
originality, and the overall im-
pression they left on the crowd.

“It is really impressive that we have
that talent at this school...I really
like the energy that the performers
brought to [the event]. ”

said junior Briana Gapsis, who
was in attendance. V

The event was co-sponsored
by the General Activities Board
and the Office of Student Activi-
ties and Greek Life. Dana Smith,
Assistant Director of Student
Activities and Greek Life, said
that despite fewer contenders this
year, she was excited about the
experience each group brought to
the event.

Fans responded with home-
made signs, occasional singing
and dancing along, and plenty of
skyward cell phones during the
slower numbers. Several fans
said that despite sound issues and
a relatively low turnout, the bands
spared no expense with their per-
forrnances.

Professor Timothy Lu-
bin, Associate Professor of Re-
ligion and one of the evening’s
judges, was also pleased with the
level of competition at this year’s
event.

“If they’re all going to be pret-
ty good, it’s really hard,” Lubin
said. “It was really close.” Com-
pared to past battles he has seen
.atthe high school level, accord-
ing to Lubin, judges can typically
eliminate one or more bands be-
fore deciding on the ﬁnal winner.

“I don’t think that was really
possible tonight.”

The evening’s other judges in-
cluded Kelli Austin, Assistant Di-
rector for Engagement in Alunmi
Affairs, and Jenny Ratzel, Ad-
missions Counselor, both alunmi
of the university.

As for Professor Lubin’s fa-
vorite moment of the evening:
“Well, that was a pretty fabulous
drum display,” he said of fresh-
man Luke Ellis’ performance dur-
ing runner-up Agent Flynn’s set.
Ellis took command of the stage
with an extended drum solo be-
fore the band launched into their
ﬁnal song, an original composi-
tion that left the crowd calling for
more. .

“Regardless of placing, I’m
just happy that everyone seemed

to have a great time,” said Jamie-

Goodin, lead guitarist for Agent
F lynn. He called the event a suc-
cess in terms of the stiff competi-
tion and musicianship, as well as
its bringing together members of
the Washington and Lee campus
and community in attendance.

“I feel like it just builds the
event once again for next year.”

W&L dancers impress

Student group full of passion and talent

By Celeste Cruz-Carandang
STA F F W R IT E R

The Washington and Lee Rep-
ertory Dance Company put on a
glittering performance last Friday
night. Full of unique choreography
and daring artistic risks, the entire
program was a prime sample of
several different dancing styles.
The audience enthusiastically ap‘-
plauded each segment of the per-
formance and expressed its delight
in the playful surprises of the com-
pany. Even under the pressure of
opening night, the Repertory Dance
Company successfully put together
a reﬁned and moving recital.

During the course of two years,
the Repertory Dance Company has
ﬂourished and thrived.

Through the nurturing attitudes
of both the administration and the
artists, the company now boasts
a company of 35 highly talented
members. i

Since its founding, the program
has expanded to include classes in
ballet, modern dance, dance com-
position and the analysis and his-
tory of dance.

The variety of classes facilitated
the creation of a versatile dance
company. Partnered with the clas-
sically trained dancers is a myriad
of modern, tap and praise dancers.
Each company member lends his or
her own talent and refreshing point
of view to the program.

The performance consisted
of 15 individual segments. The
students of the company choreo-
graphed several of these acts . Ni-
cole Carter,A’rese Emokpae, Molly
Harrington, Hannah ‘Kate Mitchell,

Julia Pleasants, Emily Wallace and

S Sophie Xiong acted as the student

choreographers for the recital.

A collection of faculty and guest
artists also afforded their talents for
dance composition. Assistant Pro-
fessor, Jenefer Davies, and dance
instructor, Sandra Meythaler, both
choreographed dances which made
their respective viewpoints con-
cerning the arts evident.

The " artistic contributions of
ShaLeigh Comerford, Liza Deck,
Robin Harris, Plasticmusik, Kevin
Remingotn and Claire Tunkel add-
ed a refreshing interpretation of the
music choices.

The skills of the dancers were as-
tonishing. The youth of the program
did not take away from the profes-
sional attitudes of the performers.
However, it seems that the jitters of
opening night did take their toll on
some aspects of the show. Although
obviously talented, some dancers
were not completely synchronized
with the rest of their company. The
pieces never seemed unorganized,
merely unpolished. The technical
difficulties also took away from
the audience’s experience of the
concert itself. At several points, the
lights turned on when they were not
meant to. Music also cued at the

wrong times and threw off some i

dancers for a few seconds.

Despite some minor mishaps,
the show was a success because of
the talent of the dancers, as well
as their evident passion for their
art. The performers were eager to
take risks and were fully commit-
ted to their characters. At one point,
beach balls with smiley faces were

thrown into the crowd as the danc-
ers yelled and screamed.

A screen and photographer was
the only prop for Claire Tunkel as
she danced an evocative piece.

As she danced, she was photo-
graphed and the pictures were pro-
jected to the audience by an over-
head screen.

Sophie Xiong demonstrated her
own meticulous and beautiful inter-
pretation of a peacock in a dance
named after the bird itself.

Guest artists ShaLeigh Com-
erford and Claire Tunkel danced
to excerps from “The History of

“Love.” Their striking choreography
and genuine commitment to such a a

raw piece elicited both sadness and
inspiration from the audience.

The favorites of the night includ-
ed PlasticOrganics which included
contributions from the Plasticmusik
percussion group, Some Kind of
Ship, a quirky piece involving a
colorful array of ladies’ shoes, and
Phobias, which featured the smil-
ing beach balls being thrown into
the audience.

The Repertory Dance Com-
pany performed a stunning recital.
Although hindered by a few dif-
ﬁculties, the audience was moved
and fascinated by the talents of the
dancers as well as the unexpected
artistic direction.

As the curtain fell on the stage of
Keller Theatre, the audience rose in
appreciation for the lucky opportu-
nity to watch their peers transform.

For the men, sophomore Billy Billington set a school
record and a meet record, and his throw was also good
enough for a NCAA provisional qualifying mark in the
weight toss. As a result, he took 1st in the event with his
ﬁnal throw being 16.75 meters. Billington also took sec-
ond in the shot put with a throw of 47 feet, 6 inches.

“I was happy with my 1st place ﬁnish in the weight
throw and 2nd place ﬁnish in the shot put,’,’ said Bill-
ington. “It’s always a great meet when you set personal
records in all of your events.”

Sophomore Ryan Castle was ﬁrst in the high jump
with a leap of 1.93 meters despite the meet being his ﬁrst
in weeks after recovering from an injury.

Freshman Jeff Giordano took home the bronze after ‘
ﬁnishing the 55 meters in a time of 6.55, and set a school
record after completing the 200 meters in a time of 22.89.
Giordano was also named ODAC Rookie of the Year.

“We have a great team with a ton of potential and

mented Castle on the teams ﬁnish. “I think in the future,
as our young team develops more, actually winning these
meets will be a viable goal.”

Hildenbrand continued, “I was really happy with the
way that we ran. All our training has paid off and every-
one peaked at the right time,” she said. “We are in a great
position to make a serious run at the outdoor title.”

One thing that both teams attribute their success to
is the closeness of their teams and the support of their
coaches. With these qualities, they are looking forward
to what should be an exciting and successful outdoor
season.

Five and a half minutes later, after the Generals went down
by ﬁve, Bienemann wound up on a fast break and converted
on a layup while being fouled which could have cut the lead
to two. However, one ofﬁcial signaled it was an intentional
foul while the other foul while the other called it a travel; the
controversial ruling was a travel and resulted in the turning
point of the game. W&L was never able to decease the 5-point
deﬁcit from then on and ultimately lost 76-66.

The Blue and White ﬁnished the game with four players in
double ﬁgures. McHugh tallied a career high l7 points, 14 of
which came in the second half. White chipped in 10 points off
of the bench. Goodman added in 11. Bienemann ﬁnished by
tying the game high with 17 points which was a ﬁtting ending
to his tremendous career. Additionally, Bienemann became the
Generals’ sixth all-time leading scorer. Kusimo was saddled
with foul trouble the entire game, but still managed 13 re-
bounds, a testament to the perseverance that exempliﬁed his
career. ‘

In Bienemann and Kusimo’s four years, the Generals have
gone from 2 and 23 overall and O and 18 in the conference to
15 and 11 overall and 11 and 8 in the conference, a remarkable
turn around. Coach Hutchinson reafﬁrrned their importance to
the program by saying how far the program has come with
them at the helm.

“I feel a tremendous sense of connection with this en-
tire team, but with Greg and Femi in particular,” said Coach
Hutchinson. “We struggled together through that 2-23 season,
and we have been growing together ever since. Their tenacity
is really what made all of the improvement possible.”

Even though the team did not reach its goal of an ODAC
title, the season was still a success and another step in the right
direction.

“I think that I share with the guys a real sense of accom-
plishment about this season,” said Coach Hutchinson. “To
have a winning record in basketball in this league is no easy
thing. My hope is that we can continue to build on this sea-
son.”

Goodman said the goal for next year is not only to ascend
to the next level and bring home an ODAC championship, but
also to make Washington & Lee Men’s Basketball history.

“Our goal for next year is to win the ODAC champion-
ship,” said Goodman. “Another big goal is to have the best
all-time record at W&L. We know that those goals will take a
lot of effort, but double digit wins was supposed to be hard to
get, and we got that. A plus .500 season was supposed to be
hard to get, and we got that too.”

Pitching getting the job done

Generals ﬁring on all cylinders as they start the season 9-2

Returning a talented core of po-
sition players but looking to replace
long-time ace Clayton Edwards,
Washington and Lee has raced out
to an impressive 9-2 start on the
year. Returning outﬁelders Tim

» Livingston and Terrence McKelvey

have gotten off to another hot start,
but the biggest ‘surprise has been
freshman leftﬁelder Anthony Car-
dona. Though the Generals outﬁeld
looked set with Livingston, MCK-
elvey and James Madden, the same
group who started last season, Car-
dona has won himself a regular spot
in the lineup by getting 18 hits in his
ﬁrst 30 at bats.

To accommodate Cardona, Mad-
den has been getting some time at
Designated Hitter, and Cardona has
also been starting whenever Liv-
ingston pitches. A

McKelvey, aside from post-
ing a .421 average, second highest
among the team’s starters, also has
hit three home runs while hitting in
the lead—off spot. Madden, a senior,
and sophomore Hunter Serenbetz
lead the team with 13 RBIs.

One lingering question coming
into this year was the team’s start-
ing rotation. Clayton Edwards, who
led the team in wins and innings
pitched over the last two years,
graduated last May. But Livings-
ton, who spent his ﬁrst two years
in the rotation before splitting time
last year between the outﬁeld and
pitching mound, has helped provide
stability byiopening the year 3-0
with a 2.57 ERA. Chuck Davidson,
a sophomore who saw signiﬁcant
action last year, is also 3-0 and has
a sterling 2.00 ERA.

In Coach Tyler McCabe’s sec-
ond season, the men’s lacrosse
team has returned to the national
rankings and is set to compete in
what will once again be one of
America’s strongest lacrosse con-
ferences. Last year’s team went 9-
6, with four of the losses coming

This year’s squad, ranked No.
15 in the latest Division III poll,

the season by stomping Savannah
College of Art and Design before
defeating York College in Lexing-

plenty of offense, scoring nine or

more runs ﬁve times in the season’s

ﬁrst two weeks.

The team’s only losses came to
No. 5 Emory University and Pied-
mont University. Both games were
played in Atlanta. Against Emory
the Generals rallied from an early

deﬁcit to tie the score at six before

Emory got two unearned runs in the
ninth inning.

On Saturday the Generals
stomped Emory and Henry 12-0 and
18-0 to open conference play. The
victories also gave long-time Coach
Jeff Stickley 300 wins. Stickley, in

The Indoor Men’s and
Women’s Track Teams ﬁn-
ished a solid season with
strong performances Friday at
their ODAC Championships.
The women comfortably took
2nd, while the men ﬁnished
3rd—their highest placement in
10 years. Overall, the Generals
left the meet with :10 All-Con-
ference citations, three school
records and ﬁve conference
championship meet records.

The women started off strong
with the Distance Medley Re-
lay of freshman Katherine Fen-
wick, junior Tara Hildenbrand,
freshman Christine Baliseri
and sophomore Kat Telfeyan.
The women broke apart from
the pack on the ﬁrst leg. By the
second leg, there was no ques-
tion who would be winning. In
the end, the relay ﬁnished 1st in
a time of 13519.36.

In the women’s mile, the
Generals took all three med-

als, led by junior Elizabeth
Webb, who took 1st in a time
of 5:11.51. Junior Becca Tay-
lor took 2nd with a time of
5:22.85, and sophomore Doro-

“Ever since my fresh-
man, year, I have truly
longed for the indoor
800-meter title. ”

ELIZABETH WEBB, Junior captain
 

thy Todd rounded out the three
with a time of 5:27.85.

“The mile was a great race
this year,” commented Todd.
“Sweeping 1st , through 3rd
place was really exciting, and
I was so happy to be a part of
that team effort.”

“I was thrilled to win both
the mile and the 800,” said
Webb. “Ever since my fresh-

man year, I have truly longed
for the indoor 800 meter title.
I watched it slip from my grasp
on the ﬁnal straight-away in
both 2006 and 2007, but this
year, as I came down the home
stretch, I knew I ﬁnally had it,
and I could barely contain my

- excitement.” '

Webb took 1st in the ‘800
with a time of 2:21.54. Both
her 800 meter and mile ﬁnish
were good enough for meet re-
cords. Afterwards, the ODAC
named her Scholar-Athlete of
the year.

Junior Grace Andrews took
3rd in the weight throw with a
toss of 13.33 meters. Sopho-
more Maggie Sutherland set a
school record in the 55 meters
with a time of 8.91. Junior Sta-
cy Doombos jumped a distance
of 17 feet, 9 inches to ﬁnish
2nd in the long jump, while she
took 3rd in the 400 meters with
at time of 60.80.

Andrews commented that it
felt great to ﬁnish 3rd.

“Prior to last year, I had nev-
er competed in track, so to do so
well was an awesome feeling,”
she said. “I am so blessed to be
able to do a sport that I have no
background in, but totally love,
and geta medal out of it.”

Another notable event of the
night came when junior Jess
Shaw set a conference meet
record in the 5000 meters with
a comfortable 1st place ﬁnish
in a time of 17:45.85 — just 5
seconds off of a national pro-
visional time standard. Shaw’s
lead was so comfortable, in
fact, she lapped the entire ﬁeld
twice. I

“I am so blessed to have
wonderful teammates who
were supporting me around
every turn,” commented Shaw.
“There are moments when you
want to give up, but their sup-
port and encouraging words
kept me going.”

Maroons strand Generals

Roanoke is hot shooting keys 76-66 victory over men in ODAC quaterﬁnal

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
Men’s Basketball renaissance
season ended Friday after the
team fell to arch-rival Roanoke
College in the ﬁrst round of the
ODAC tournament.

The two teams split the sea-
son series with the‘Generals
winning on the road in over-
time in the second matchup.
Both teams had identical 11-7
records in conference, but the
Maroons won the tie-breaker,
making them the 4 seed and
the Generals the 5 seed. This
is the highest seed for the Blue
and White since the 1990-91
season.

The night before the game,
at the annual ODAC banquet,
W&L came away with three
prestigious conference awards.
Senior captain Greg Biene-
mann was ﬁrst team all-con-
ference for the second straight
year, the ﬁrst W&L player
to accomplish this feat in 25
years. Bienemann is also a ﬁ-
nalist for the Jostens Trophy,
the award for the Division III
Player of the Year. Junior cap-
tain Isaiah Goodman was se-
lected to the 10-player ODAC
Sportsmanship Team. Lastly,
Coach Adam Hutchinson was
named the ODAC Coach of the
Year, the ﬁrst Generals coach
to achieve this accolade since
the 1988-89 season.

“The Coach of the Year
award is actually a team hon-
or,” said Coach Hutchinson.
“It is recognition of the com-
mitment and effort this team
displayed and the success that
resulted. I am honored to have
been a part of it with this spe-
cial group of people.”

After the six-day layoff

minutes later, both teams found
their rhythm on offense as Ju-
nior Ryan Owens fed a slash-
ing sophomore, Zac White, for
the easy layup.

Roanoke then went on
a mini run to open up an 8-
point advantage, 20-12. Fresh-
man Jason Cimino ended the
run as he knifed through the

“The Coach of the Year award is actually a

team honor: It is recognition of the commit-

ment and effort this team displayed and the

success that resulted. I am honored to have

been a part of it with this special group of

people. ”

from action for the Generals,
the team started out slowly in
the ODAC tournament game
against Roanoke. AJ Dowell
of the Maroons sunk the ﬁrst
two shots of the contest to give
Roanoke a 4-0 lead. Good-
man opened up the scoring for
W&L with a 3-point shot two
minutes into the game. Biene-
mann scored the team’s next
basket on an up-and-under
layup while being fouled, just
as he has done all year. A few

lane and banked in the left-
handed layup. Subsequently,
after Roanoke turned the ball
over, -White slammed the ball
home on the fast break. The
teams then traded baskets until
Goodman knocked down two
3-pointers to knot the game at
22-22 with roughly 10 minutes
left in the half.

The Maroons immediately
re-gained the lead and extend-
ed it to nine. With 3.6 seconds
remaining in the half, Biene-

mann muscled up another and-
one to give the team some mo-
mentum right before the half.
The score was 39-32 in favor
of Roanoke at the break.

That momentum at the end
of the half did not last as the
Maroons opened up the second
stanza by pushing the lead out
to nine points. Senior captain
F emi Kusimo answered with a
two from the foul line. Junior
Chris McHugh then caught ﬁre
from behind the are by sinking
three 3-pointers to deadlock
the score at 43-43.

With 11:31 left in the game,
Goodman dished to Biene-
mann for a reverse layup while
being fouled. Bienemann sank
in the free throw attempt and
gave the Generals its ﬁrst lead
in the game, 51-49. Dowell
countered with the next four
points of the game for Roa-
noke to make the score 53-51.
McHugh answered that with
his ﬁfth 3—pointer of the game
to give W&L the one-point
advantage, but the advantage
quickly evaporated and Roa-
noke re-took the lead once and
for all.

“We came back in the sec-
ond half by making some cru-

cial plays,” said Goodman.‘

“We got some stops and hit

“some big shots, but Roanoke

found a way to pull it off.”
