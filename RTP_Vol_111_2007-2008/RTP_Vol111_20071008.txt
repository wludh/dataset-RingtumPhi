  . Quadrennial convention

Alums recount signiﬁcant Mock Con experiences

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

When Sam Syme remembers
Washington and Lee’s famous 1956
convention, he remembers the front
row seat he had for all the action.

“I was Secretary of the Student
Body, which made me secretary of
the convention," Syme, a member of
the Class of I956, said.

“Mainly that meant I called the
roll ofstatesz Alabama, etc.”

Syme, who also served as editor of
The Ring—tum Phi, was sitting on the
podium when Sen. Alben W. Bark-
ley, a former Vice President who had
returned to the Senate as Kentucky’s
junior member, came up to speak.

Such a prominent Democratic
speaker had attracted huge crowds to
Doremus Gymnasium.

Syme remembers that the students

were joined by local residents and a
large press delegation. The governor
of Virginia was in the audience as
well.

“Barkley got up to make his
speech, and he was using lots of

revival.”

Barkley’s next — and ﬁnal — words
are well known.

As he described his 50 years of
government service to the cheering
crowd, he said, “I would rather be a

“Barkley got up to make his speech, and he was
using lots of biblical quotes, being very folksy. He
was working himself up, and he sort of spoke like a
revival preacher. You didn ’t know if you were at a
convention or a Baptist revival. ”

SAM SYME, Class of 1956

Biblical quotes, being very folksy,”
Syme said. “He was working him-
self up, and he sort of spoke like a
revival preacher. You didn’t know if
you were at a convention or a Baptist

servant in the land of the Lord than sit
in the seats of power.”

As the crowd cheered, Barkley
suddenly collapsed.

“He staggered, caught himself

and then hit me in the knee as he fell
down,” Syme said.

Doctors hurried out of the crowd,
but Barkley was pronounced dead at
the scene.

The next morning Lexington ap-
peared on the front pages of newspa-
pers across America. The press corps
covering the convention raced to call
in their stories.

Barkley’s body was taken to
Washington, D.C., where it would lay
in state at the Capitol. Syme and sev-
eral other students traveled to D.C. as
an informal escort for the late Sena-
tor.

“There were four W&L students
and four VMI students” Syme said.
“It was good because the cadets
knew what to do with these sorts of
things.”

Beta offers 12 bids to former Kappa Sigs

Frat alum expresses enthusiasm, support for recolonization of Alpha Rho chapter

By Sarah Kientz
STAFF WRITER

Adam Porter Price, Beta Theta
Pi’s Senior Leadership Consultant,
has no problem closing chapters.

“We enjoy closing chapters,” Price
said. “We’re not willing to accept me-
diocrity and we stand for the things
we believe in. It helps us live up to
our standards.”

Recolonization of Beta chapters

under this philosophy has been oc-

curring around the country. Price

said that in the last ﬁve years, Beta
has closed 60 chapters and done “ex-
pansions,” or recolonizations, in 40.
Bill Kientz, a 1976 alumnus of
Alpha Rho chapter who spoke with
Ring-tum Phi Managing Editor Jacob

Geiger, was in Lexington for a re-
union at the time Beta was dismissed
from W&L.

He said, “I don’t think anybody
was incensed by it. Some of us were
told why. As adults, you scratch your
head and go, ‘Geez guys...”’

Kientz sympathizes with the
freshmen pledging Beta at the time of
dismissal. He said, “The [freshmen]
probably didn’t have a lot to do with
it and then lost their chapter.”

Currently, Price is looking to ﬁll
the new chapter with both freshmen
and upperclassmen who are either in-
dependent or have disafﬁliated.

Kappa Sigma was removed from
campus this past year, creating an
entire fratemity-worth of potential

Betas. Price has already extended 14
bids to upperclassmen, 12 of whom
are former Kappa Sigs.

“We enjoy closing chapters.
‘We ’re not willing to accept

mediocrity  It helps us live

I

up to our standards. ’

ADAM PRICE, Beta representative
 

“We’re looking for guys who are in
tune with the experience of fraternity
life, but the experience we’re looking

for is much different than what that
fraternity was,” Price said, compar-
ing Beta to Kappa Sig. “While we’re
not going to be necessarily better than
any other fraternity, it’ll be different
and unique and not like the former
Kappa Sig chapter and certainly not
like the former Beta chapter.”

‘ Junior Rogers Crain, a former
Kappa Sig, has accepted his bid to
become one of Beta’s Refounding
Fathers.

He is excited to create a new fra-
ternity. “I chose to join Beta because I
thought it would be a very unique op-
portunity that I would never have
been able to do otherwise,” Crain
said. “The chance to build a fraternity

national theft

Internet sites like eBay used
as unconventional tools for
criminal investigations

By was 0’DeIl
srnrr warren

This summer, Sgt. Mark Riley of the Lexington Po-
lice Department solved a national crime using eBay.

Riley said that while browsing eBay for leads was
not standard procedure before, he’ll be “checking it
regularly” from now on.

Following a trail that threatened to go cold, local
officers helped bring to justice a William and Mary stu-
dent who is now charged with the theft of somewhere
between $300,000 and $500,000 worth of property.

The student, Curtis White, is accused of master-
minding a crime spreethat stretched from Maine to
Mississippi and affected between six and eight sepa-
rate colleges, including Washington and Lee.

W&L’s involvement began on July 17, when eight
overhead projectors valued at nearly $45,000 were
stolen from several locked 200-and 300-level Huntley
Hall classrooms. Flash Floyd, who oversees the projec-
tors, was shocked.

“It is just old fashioned
police work I ’m most
happy to just get the
equipment back It
makes you proud to be
from Lexington. ”

MARK RILEY, Sergeant at Lexington Police Department

“You simply don’t expect something on this scale to
happen on our campus,” Floyd said.

The police were similarly bafﬂed.

“We had no leads, no suspects, no witnesses,” said
Riley, the investigator in charge.

The case remained stalled until July 31, when Riley
decided to check the intemet auction site, eBay.com, to
“cover his bases” and see if the missing projectors had
turned up there.

Sure enough, Riley found several projectors up for
auction that matched the description of those stolen
from Huntley Hall.

They also lacked remote controls, an oddity that
quickly drew the investigator’s attention.

Riley proceeded to contact the seller of the items,
who had purchased them from a second party and
knew nothing of their origins.

According to eBay’s website, it strictly prohibits
the sale of stolen property and “strongly supports law
enforcement efforts” to recover such items.

In this case, the seller confirmed that the ID num-
bers of the projectors matched those stolen from W&L
and then turned them over.

The case was far from closed, however, as the po-
lice proceeded to track the check that the seller had
written to pay for the projectors; it led them to Curtis
White, a resident of Stafford, Va. and a student at Wil-
liam and Mary.

Using both evidence obtained from the seller and
security camera footage from George Mason Univer-
sity, which also suffered a break-in earlier in the year,
police obtained a warrant and searched White’s home.

There, they found a lock core from Huntley Hall.

According to Riley, White employed the same
scheme at many colleges: he would scope out the facil-
ity a few days beforehand and remove a lock core from
one of the doors.

He would then make a key that would allow him to
inﬁltrate classrooms with ease and make off with the
valuable technology inside.

Further investigation revealed that White had ac-
complices, and that he may have even hacked the
W&M computer network to raise his grades. White
himself was arrested in Philadelphia not long after and
is currently in the Fairfax jail awaiting trial.

For defense, White has hired Peter Greenspun, a
prominent attorney whose past clients include sports-
caster Marv Albert and John Allen Muhammad, the D.
C.—area sniper.

However, between the lock core and evidence re-
covered at George Mason, Riley said he is conﬁdent
that there is a “real strong case” against him.

As for the projectors, the University quickly ﬁled an
insurance claim and had them replaced.

According to Treasurer and Vice President for

crack the case

Finance Steve McAllister, the re-
covered projectors are thus the
property of the insurance company
and will soon be transferred.

According to Floyd, security up-
grades are already underway to pre-
vent ﬁiture thefts. He also praised
the investigators for the unlikely
recovery.

“I don’t think anyone thought
there was a chance of recovering the
projectors,” Floyd said. <

“Our Public Safety Ofﬁce and
the Lexington Police Department
did a tremendous job in investigat-
ing this incident.”

Riley is taking particular pride
in the leading role the Lexington
Police took in this multi-state inves-
tigation and in the fact that W&L’s
projectors were the only stolen
property recovered.

“It’s just old fashioned police
work  I’m most happy to just get
the equipment back,” Riley said.

The investigation is soon to be
featured on “America’s Most Want-
ed.”

Riley added: “It makes you
proud to be from Lexington.”

Syme and the other students spent
the night at the house of Edith Wil-

Fifty-one years later, Syme re-

Later that spring, at Mrs. Barkley’s
urging, the convention ﬁnally recon-
vened, eventually selecting Adlai
Stevenson.

Fifty years after graduation,
Syme still comes back to campus
twice a year.

He’s enjoyed watching the cam-

good to pass up.”

He added, “The experience will
be unique because the undergradu-
ate members will be in the driver’s
seat. [It] will allow us to build
exactly the kind of organization
that we want without any negative
qualities.”

Kientz is similarly optimistic.
He believes that the current recolo-
nization of Beta at W&L has been
successful thus far and is moving in
the right direction. He said, “[Price]
seems like a nice guy and is doing it
the right way. I think all the alums
alﬁliated with a fraternity want to
see their chapter on campus.”

Most importantly, Kientz wants
current students to have the same
experiences as he and his brothers.
“Fratemities were great places to

. get together. It was an interesting

group of people,” he said.

Like Price, Crain said that Beta
is looking for individuals who are
“leaders, scholars and gentlemen”
but that the upperclassmen, who
will be initiated in December, will
not have the ﬁnal decision on the
freshmen pledge class that will be
initiated in March.

“The upperclassmen will have‘

some say in who is chosen, but ul-
timately Adam Price will be making
all decisions on who gets a bid,”
Crain said.

Price said that the chapter will
be satisﬁed with 20 new members,
but will not be disappointed if they
receive less than quota.

“We’re focused on ﬁnding the
right men, not a certain amount of
men,” Price said. “We’re more con-
cerned with quality than quantity.”

Deﬁning Lee’s place in history

Scholars gather to consider Lee as a general, leader and teacher

By Alexandra Scaggs
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee will con-
tinue its celebration of Robert E.
Lee’s 200* birthday today with a
full-day symposium at Lee Cha-
pel.

The program will begin at 10
a.m. with keynote speaker Peter
S. Carmichael, editor of “Audac-
ity Personiﬁed: Essays on the
Generalship of Robert E. Lee.”

His speech, entitled “Truth is
Mighty and Will Eventually Pre-
vail: Why Americans Disagree
about the Historical Legacy of
Robert E. Lee,” will discuss the

representation of Robert E. Lee
at museums and historical sites,
Lee Chapel included.

Carmichael is the Eberly Pro-
fessor of Civil War Studies at
West Virginia University. Since
Lee’s 200th birthday on January
19, the university has hosted nu-
merous panels and discussions to
consider Lee’s legacy.

The rest of the day will be a
discussion of Lee’s three most
important roles: a general, a
leader, and a teacher. At ll:l5
a.m., A. Wilson Greene and Gor-
don Rhea will speak on “General
Lee’s Overland Campaign.”

Greene has written six books
and over two dozen articles on
Civil War and Southern history.
He also worked as a historian
for the National Park Service for
16 years. His most recent book
focused on Petersburg, site of a
nine month siege in 1864-1865.

Rhea is a co-author of “In the
Footsteps of Grant and Lee: The
Wilderness Through Cold Har-
bor.”

At 2 pm., Lee’s leadership
abilities will be the subject in
“General Lee and the Rank and
File,” presented by Dr. J. Tracy
Power, a South Carolina histori-

an, and Dr. Aaron Sheehan-Dean,
a history professor at University
of North Florida. There will be a
short Q&A session after the two
historians speak.

The author of “Robert E.
Lee: A Biography,” Dr. Emory
Thomas, and Virginia Historical
Society representative John Mc-
Clure will speak last, with “Lee
and Education.”

They will give insight into
Lee’s identity as an educator and
his relationships with the stu-
dents and faculty of then-named
Washington College.

They will also discuss the

fallout from Lee’s loss in the
Civil War and the seizure of his
plantation for the Freedman Bu-
reau’s village, a settlement for
freed slaves.

Monday’s panel coincides
with last week’s reopening of th
chapel’s museum. Lee’s base-
ment ofﬁce is once again open to
visitors.

The crypt where Lee, his
wife, children and other family
members are buried is also open
again for public viewing.

Your God- given right to sag

Beware: The idea of a fashion police is no longer a silly notion, its a reality

By Kathie Scott
COLUMNIST

A fashion “faux pas” refers to
a social blunder. And within the
fashion world this term can be de-
ﬁned as wearing chocolate brown
with black, white after Labor Day,
or cropped pants with boots.

Some fashion experts claim
that rules were meant to be bro-
ken. After all, sometimes brown
and black don’t look so bad to-
gether.

However, some cities in the
U.S. feel one fashion faux pas that
should be avoided is that of visi-
ble undergarments, usually paired
with baggy pants. In Delcambre,
La., wearing anything that allows
your underwear to be visible is
punished with a ﬁne of up to $500
or six months in jail.

The baggy pants tradition be-
gan in jails when prisoners were
not permitted to wear belts for
fear of injury. The trend shifted
to the community, spread nation-
wide, and became a fashion trend.
They’re concerned that if crimi-
nals wear baggy pants, then those
who wear baggy pants must be
criminals. Supporters of the ban
fear that the baggy pants phenom-
enon will carry down to small
children, thus introducing a life of
crime and violence early on.

In my opinion, I think baggy
pants are ridiculous. I won’t lie,
I can deﬁnitely appreciate a guy
who wears a natural sag, which
falls just around the hips (Note:
Since the idea of sagging might
be a foreign concept to some

readers on this campus please
note that “sagging” is the verb for
producing baggy jeans. “Baggy”
is merely the adjective involved
in describing this ﬁnal product.
“Sag” can be used as a noun as
well as an adjective).

In fact, I enjoy the natural sag.
This natural sag usually involves
a little boxer Visibility; 1 can deal
with a little.

However, there are more ex-
treme methods of sagging. This
sagging usually involves a lot of
underwear visibility and you can
usually tell how bad the sagging
is by checking the alignment of
the back pockets with the person’s
body. For instance, back pockets
aligning with the back of one’s
knees equals too much sagging.
Pretty much anything that goes
below mid-butt range is too much
sagging.

All opinions aside, how ridic-
ulous is this law? Does anybody
else feel this might infringe on
First Amendment rights? Granted
it’s the right to look stupid, but
everybody should have that right!
Previous generations had the right
to look stupid when legwarrners,
tie dye shirts, and shoulder pads
were “in.”

Let’s think about this logically
with regards to the Constitution.
America guarantees freedom. Is-
sues only arise when person A’s
freedom infringes upon person
B’s freedom. Maybe showing un-
derwear infringes upon the rights
of others. But if were to be sen-
sitive to those rights, this brings
about an entirely new set of ques-

  . Speaking out for common courtesy

Don ’t greet others simply because it is tradition but because it is the right thing

By Celeste Cruz-Caradang
and Joan Oguntlmeln
C O L U M N I S T 8

Two letters.

Just two, making a word that
makes a world of difference.

“Hi.” One syllable made in
one breath.

Yet people on this campus
ﬁnd it so hard to say this simple
word. “Hi.”

Why?

We’re not really sure. May-
be they’re talking on their cell
phone, running and therefore out
of breath, detached, spaced out,
or simply just don’t care.

Washington and Lee holds

.not only an academic reputation

of greatness, but also possesses
one of the most coveted histori-
cal legacies in the nation, which
is immersed in traditions.

One such tradition has be-
come less precious to our com-
munity.

The Speaking Tradition, as its
name implies, is a time honored
custom that simply speaks of the
civility that all members of the_
W&L community possess, or
rather should possess.

Indeed, despite the sense
of community that it gives our
school, the Speaking Tradition
has gone unpracticed, unnoticed,
and undervalued.

Our late president John W.
Elrod said it best in his 1995 in-
augural address: “The Speaking
Tradition calls for the ordinary
courtesy of greeting each other
in our daily commerce. It is a
simple act but one whose mean-

ing and value we should not un-
derestimate.”

So if the Speaking Tradition
calls for common courtesy of
greeting, why do people ﬁnd it
so hard to practice it?

Why do students ﬁnd it so
easy to practice the Honor Sys-
tem, our other major tradition
here at W&L, but not the Speak-
ing Tradition? They both boil
down to the same thing; respect
for each other.

I think we all have to realize
that the phrase “common cour-
tesy” is a rather curious oxymo-
ron. Courtesy is not as simple as
the preceding adjective implies.
In fact, it is what makes a per-
son different and noticeable in
today’s society.

But despite the lack of good
manners in the “real world,” at
W&L it is common courtesy that
makes this student body have
such a pleasantly refreshing am-
bience of welcome and commu-
nity.

This school has only 1700
students, a much smaller popula-
tion that that of the high schools
many of us attended. You’ve
probably met, seen, or know al-
most everyone on this tiny cam-
pus. To refuse to greet someone
as they pass you by is purely
rude and quite frankly, it shows a
serious deﬁciency in character.

Now, please don’t misunder-
stand us. We’re not asking you
to walk around like an annoying
happy machine, getting in every-
one’s face for a chance to say hi.

We know everyone has their
bad days where they just don’t
feel like being around people or

engaging in a conversation with
anyone.

However, greeting someone
or at least acknowledging his or
her presence with a simple head
nod, hand wave, or slight upward
curl of your lips, won’t make
your day any worse.

In fact, their possible kind
and polite response to your civil
gesture might be exactly what
you need to make your day a
little brighter.

Now I know that this can be a
tiresome task. We will be the ﬁrst
to admit that we do not always
behave courteously and actively
practice the Speaking Tradition.

It does take a small amount
of courage to start that awkward
sidelong eye contact, continue
into the instinct of looking down
as the other person approaches,
and the progress somewhat re-
luctantly into gazing upward and
giving the salutation of choice.

The latter portion in itself is
difficult. Aﬂer all, there are the
head nod friends, the high-ﬁve
group, and then the regular old
vocal hello students.

Yet, as heart-wrenching as
this second long process is, may-
be all we have to do is take a step
back and realize that hi is just
hi. If the other person does not
reciprocate our reception, social
suicide is not inevitable.

If we want W&L to continue
to be the tight-knit community
that it aspires to be, we must
each do our part to uphold this
tradition.

The Speaking Tradition and
the Honor System give W&L its
singularity and superiority.

We visit and experience a
community in which we are wel-
comed, accepted for our individ-
uality, appreciated for our integ-
rity and valued for our intellect
and creativity.

Yes, academic prestige did
contribute a lot to our college
decision, but it was this afore-
mentioned sense of comfort that
made W&L more of a home than
a large state school or larger pri-
vate schools.

I In short, we were all drawn
to this school because from the
minute we walked on campus
and saw the sweeping white an-
tebellum columns and red clay
buildings, complete strangers
greeted us,

As much as the architecture
may make it seem, W&L is not
simple a place of history and tra-
dition.

The founding date of our uni-
versity does not deﬁne our sense
of honor or our sense of cour-
tesy.

Therefore, do not feel com-
pelled to great that fellow stu-
dent because of that trident on
your ﬂip ﬂops or the Generals
emblem on your polo.

Say hello because it is the
right thing to do.

We appeal to you: Please
don’t let the Speaking Tradition
die.

Revive it once again.

Let it awake from its defunct
depths of dormancy to show the
world its power and potential to
inﬂict change.

Let us practice civility.

tions.

If others feel it is unbearable
to witness the exposure of some
underwear (namely, boxers which
are really just shorts anyways)
then maybe I shouldn’t have to go
to the beach and shield my eyes
from the inappropriate bathing
suits worn by those who didn’t
prepare/tone up for the season.
Should I have to witness had
highlights, bad makeup, and out-
ﬁts consisting of polka dot prints
AND stripes?

If others feel its un-
bearable to witness
the exposure of box-
ers, maybe I shouldn’t
have to shield my eyes
from inappropriate

bathing suits.

Well, hell, let’s all just wear
the same thing. That would make
things easier.

l’ll wait for the government
to send me a list of appropriate
clothing. Who knows, maybe
they’ll also be kind enough to tell
me who I should marry and how
many kids I should have! Weird
how that reminds me a lot of that
one form of government, oh yeah,
COMMUNISM!

If anti-baggy pants supporters
will make the huge jump in corre-
lating baggy pants with criminal

  

activity, I too would like to make
a jump in saying that regulations
of this nature will only escalate
until the government is involved
in every aspect of our lives.
What’s next?!

As for baggy pants spreading
to the wardrobe of small children,
instead of asking the govem-
ment to create rules concerning
dress, why not act like a parent
and enforce these rules in your
own household? As a parent, you
know what your child is wearing
and will not have to be concerned
that the minute you turn your
back, your 7-year-old son will
whip off his belt and pull down
his pants.

Teenage rebellion usually
starts during the teenage years. If
you cannot exhibit control in your
home regarding what your child
is wearing before those rebellious
years hit, maybe you should join
Britney in a parenting class or
two.

I understand that crime is an
issue in this country. I also under-
stand that one of the best places to
start is within youth. However, I
don’t understand how, after close
analysis of the nature of crime in
this country, the ﬁrst appropriate
place to start is pants. If baggy
pants began in jail and the punish-
ment for wearing baggy pants in
public can be jail time, isn’t this
just an inﬁnite loop? I suggest
someone re-assess the elements
involved in creating a criminal
and realize that people who don’t
wear baggy pants can commit

Cracking the case

Local police oﬁlcer solves school thefts

In the past few years we’ve
taken our fair share of shots at
the Lexington Police Department.
From a student perspective, there
are weekends when it seems like
the entire department has nothing
better to do than sit outside the
most popular off-campus houses.

There are few things that look
as strange as three young police
officers doing a ﬁeld sobriety test
on a 22-year-old driver who then
blows a .018 BAC.

Hopefully Chief Steve Crowder
will eventually help his new of-
ﬁcers learn to avoid the heavy-
handedness that has plagued so
many interactions with students
this year. Many of the force’s
veteran ofﬁcers could teach the
young bucks a few things about
building trust and good will with
the people you serve and protect.

But for all the criticism we’ve
leveled at the police, we know
how to give credit when it’s due.

Sgt. Mark Riley has already
been lauded in the Richmond
Times-Dispatch and other daily
newspapers. But we don’t have
a problem with repeating the
praise.

Working from his ofﬁce behind
City Hall, Riley is proof that the
intemet lets small-town detectives
solve crimes they might never
have resolved in the past.

It was Riley, not an ofﬁcer
from a larger, more prestigious
department, who went online to
look for the stolen projectors.

Riley’s smart use of Ebay
cracked a sophisticated, multi-
state crime ring that had stumped

police up and down the East
Coast.

This type of difﬁcult investiga-
tive work is exactly what Crowder
and his predecessor, Bruce Beard,
want from Lexington police.

The department has state ac-
creditation, making it one of the
smallest accredited departments
in Virginia. And as Washington
and Lee ofﬁcials will tell you
while they prepare for our accred-
itation process, earning that status
in any line of work is nothing to
sneer at.

It’s an oft-repeated cliché that
students forget they’re not always
safe on and around our campus.
The dorm intrusions last month
and the break-in at Pi Kappa Al-
pha this summer were certainly
stark reminders of that. And stu-
dents living off campus forget that
the late-night police patrols help
keep their houses safe, especially
during the long breaks when some
neighborhoods are half—empty.

Most of this work goes unno-
ticed. Students and police will
probably never get along perfect-
ly. We simply have very diﬁer-
ent goals and opinions. Many of
us choose to drink alcohol, even
though we know the age is 21.
Police are charged with enforcing
Virginia’s laws, even the ones we
break on a regular basis.

Maybe we’re never going to
get along well with the Lexington
police. Maybe the newer officers
won’t be willing to change their
style.

Mark Riley reminds us that the
police really do make Lex safe.

  

Campus should provide
for the possibility of
pregnant student

Students for Life should push for options for a
pregnant student, such as continuing classes

  



editor

Reading last week’s article on the Student’s For Life vigil made me
wonder if they had a point — this issue does need to be brought to our cam-
pus.

Now personally, I am pro-choice, and I respect that everyone has a right
to their own beliefs, but wouldn’t it be more constructive to their cause to
open options and resources to help someone who might be in that situa-
tion on this campus rather than eliminating other options that are safe, but
controversial? I

No student, at least in my experience, has ever been visibly pregnant on
this campus, so it’s hard to gauge what it would be like. Not many can deny
the extreme diﬂiculty of handling the stress of classes and being pregnant,
while also still being a part of the W&L community.

The most loved characteristic of W&L is its culture and campus life.
The education combined with its social traditions is what makes this school
what it is, what makes it unique. But currently, we have no support system

for a student to continue her education on this campus and be pregnant.

So, what is she to do? Drop out? Leave behind the experience and ben-
eﬁts of going to college at a place like W&L?
Then what happens to the child with a mother who does not have a

college education or is struggling to ﬁnish it? That child’s quality of life is
reduced.

But if that child had a mother who was supported by her university’s

community and ﬁnished her top notch education, then the quality of life
would be greatly improved.

W&L offers us so much already for our futures, and maybe efforts

Katie Hager

should be redirected so that W&L could also offer a female student in the
position of being pregnant during her four years, something for her child’s
future as well.

The University Concert
Guild brings talented

musicians to campus

By Michele Farqueharson
surr wanna

The Washington and Lee Concert Guild brings
in internationally recognized classical musicians
to campus and makes their concerts available to
Washington and Lee students.

Professor Tim Gaylard, the adviser to the Con-
cert Guild, answered some questions concerning
the Guild, how students can get involved and what
we can expect this year: -

Q: What kind of music does the Concert Guild
bring to campus?

A: [It is] always mainstream classical from the Ba-
roque, Classical, Romantic and Modern periods.

Q: How do students get involved in the Concert
Guild?
A: Music majors and students interested in mu-
sic [such as] performers and students who have
taken a lot of musical classes are invited onto the
Board.

Q: What do we have to look forward to over this
Concert ’s season?

A: There are three events this season: Pianist
Marc-André Hamelin on Tuesday, October 9th,
the a cappella group, King’s Singers, on Sunday,
February 10th, and the Brentano String Quartet on
Tuesday, March, 18th.

Professor Gaylard’s role on the Board is to
meet with the students periodically throughout the
year to suggest artists to hire for the next season,
to organize hosting the artists, and to ﬁnd support
for their performances. This is where the student
body can get involved. Ushers and people to work
back-stage are needed to produce the shows and,
as Professor Gaylard pointed out, “The concerts
are of very high quality and provide a wonderful
opportunity for all the W&L community to enjoy
ﬁne‘ musical performances.”

The Concert Guild is bringing some amazing
artists to campus this year. Marc-Andre’ Hamelin
was born in Montreal and is an internationally re-
nowned French-Canadian pianist. He has toured
all over the globe from Germany to New York to
Japan and has played with the BBC Symphony,
Royal Concertbouw, Australian Chamber Orches-
tra and Les Violons du Roy. International Piano
Quarterly claimed him as “one of the most adven-
turous and certainly the most courageous pianist
of recent times.”

If you missed Marc-André, have no fear! You
have plenty of time to prepare yourself for the a
cappella group, King’s Singers, in February. It is
a group of six men who graduated from King’s
College in Cambridge and who during their time
there were honored as choral scholars. While the
founders of the group are no longer performing,
the tradition has been upheld and the group has
been on tour for over thirty years. They have per-
formed with groups and artists such as Placido
Domingo, The Boston Pops Orchestra, and Paul
McCartney. Currently, the members include Da-
vid Hurley, Robin Tyson, Paul Phoenix, Philip
Lawson and Chris Gabbitas.

Maybe February isn’t a good month for you?
The ﬁnal performance coming to W&L is the
Brentano String Quartet. The group has per-
formed all over the world in venues such as Cam-
egie Hall, the Library of Congress, the Concert-
gebouw, the Konzerthaus and the Sydney Opera
House. The current members are Mark Steinberg,
Serena Canin, Misha Amory and Nina Lee. All
four members have degrees from the prestigious
music school, lulliard, and have taught at institu-
tions such as Princeton, Harvard, and Columbia
Universities. The New York Times remarked,
“The Brentano String Quartet is something spe-
cial...their music making is private, delicate and

’ fresh, but by its very intimacy and importance it

seizes attention.”

As you can see, these performances are of the
highest quality and provide Washington and Lee
students with an amazing chance to hear some
of the most well-known musicians in the world.
Most small universities do not have this kind of
opportunity, so please take advantage of what
your school has to offer. Sit back, relax, and enjoy
the.music!

Washington and Lee gives
a huge welcome home to
both young and old alumni

By Kimber Wiggs
STAFF WRITER

This weekend W&L welcomed back some of our long-lost compa-
triots. Our fallen comrades-in-arrns returned from the graduation grave
to grace us with their presence once more. Their homecoming began
with the usual display of enthusiasm and revelry, so now it is time to
look back on the days leading up the actual events.

Homecoming is an interesting time on campus. Seniors ﬁnally got
to partake in the Alumni Wine Tasting, while freshmen scrambled for
dates and tried to decide which frats they like the most at this moment.
For those in-between, Homecoming was, at the least, an opportunity to
look at some banners and see a pretty good, if inadequately attended,
concert in the Pavilion.

The Homecoming banners went up Tuesday, amid a wave of anti-
Catholic sentiment. Last week was certainly a good time to be a Prot-
estant on this campus.

Robert Randolph and the Family Band played Wednesday night.
The turnout for the opener, Rose Hill Drive, was less than encouraging;
though the band played a great set and deserved more attention. Hap-
pily, when Robert Randolph took the stage, an enthusiastic crowd had
gathered and was ready to bring in both the noise and the funk.

Robert Randolph got the crowd going with their perennial favor-
ite, “I Need More Love.” Everyone appeared to be having a good
time,because when Robert Randolph’s little sister asked if they were,
they all replied in the aiﬁrmative.

As for the weekend festivities, inital attitudes varied from sheer eu-
phoric excitement to anxious apprehension. Sophomore Meghan Keane
was “pumped to see her old friends and excited for the freshmen to
attend a classy W&L function that doesn’t involve beer in basements.”
Not to begin with, at least.

All in all, Homecoming was a good experience for the freshmen and
pretty much business as usual for everyone else. Now it’s time for the
cocktail dresses to go back into hibernation until Christmas Weekend
rolls around.

Field Hockey rebounds from tough loss with scoring outburst against Roanoke

By Mlchael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

This week posed two tough
ODAC matches for the Washing-
ton and Lee ﬁeld hockey team.
After suffering a tough 2-1 loss to
the Royals of Eastern Mennonite
University on Tuesday evening,
the Generals returned home to
take out their frustration on the
Maroons of Roanoke.

On Tuesday evening the Gen-
erals took on EMU in an ODAC
showdown between the two un-
beaten teams in conference play.

Twenty-ﬁve minutes into the
first half, sophomore Alyssa Der-
stine scored her ﬁrst goal of the
game on a penalty stroke to give
the Royals a 1-0 lead. Less than
ten minutes into the second half,
Derstine struck again to extend
the lead to 2-0.

The Generals refused to quit.
Less than four minutes later,
sophomore Stephanie Mansey
scored an unassisted goal to bring
the Generals within one. Howev-
er, that was as close as they would

on for the 2-1 victory.

“We need to play the entire 70
minutes to beat EMU,” said soph-
omore Sallie Armstrong. “We
had a chance on Tuesday, but we
played with too much anxiety and
were so nervous to lose that we
didn’t play together as a team.”

The Royals improved to 3-0 in
ODAC play, 4-5 overall, to lead
the conference while W&L fell to
1-1 in the conference.

It didn’t take long for the
Generals to shake off Tuesday
night’s loss. Just 70 seconds into
the game, Armstrong broke free
down the right side, ripped a shot
to the far post, and found the back
of the net to give the Generals a
1-0 lead.

“It was great to set the tone of
the game with a shot in the ﬁrst
two minutes,” said Armstrong. “It

With just over seventeen min-

sure led Roanoke to use its time-
out with 11:09 remaining in the

Though the Maroons were able
to stall the Generals attack tempo-

half with 2:20 to play in the half.

The Generals weren’t ﬁnished.
With time winding down, Korte
found sophomore Stephanie Man-
sey just inside the circle. It took
a kick save by Roanoke goalie
Lindsey Paz as time expired
to prevent another W&L goal.
Though giving up four goals, Paz
would ﬁnish with fourteen saves.

The Generals came out ready
to play in the second half, scoring
almost as fast as they had in the
ﬁrst half. Just over three minutes
in, sophomore Alex Caritis assist-
ed junior Guada Suarez to extend
the Generals’ lead to 4-0.

The Maroons refused to roll
over and die. With eighteen min-
utes to play, Roanoke was award-
ed a penalty comer and nearly
scored but sophomore goalie
Caroline Habliston made a kick
to prolong the shutout. However,
the Maroons would ﬁnd the net

“Tuesday’s loss made us want
to really beat Roanoke and really
come together as a team to beat
them,” said Armstrong. “Our
passing was the best it has been
all season, and it looks like we are
really coming together and know
where our teammates are at all
times.”

With the win, the Generals im-
prove to 5-3 overall. The Generals
return to action at home against
preseason favorite Lynchburg on
Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.

“Tuesday’s game against
Lynchburg is deﬁnitely going to
be one of the toughest games of
our season,” said Merchant. “We
have always had a huge rivalry
with them, and both of our teams
have the skill to win, so we need

The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity women’s volleyball team
won all six matches it played this
week to run its winning streak to
ten matches. After traveling to Fer-
rum on Tuesday, the Generals took
on ODAC foe Guilford at home on
Wednesday evening and then trav-
eled to Danville, VA, to participate
in the Averett Invitational, where
they swept all four matches.

On Tuesday evening the Gener-
als took on Ferrum. Without much
trouble. the Generals corralled the
Panthers, sweeping them in the
games: 30-24, 30-15, 30-27. The
Generals were led by junior Abbey
Wi1son’s six kills and ﬁve blocks
and sophomore Kristi Stevens’ 20
assists and 12 digs.

Wednesday evening the Gener-
als returned home to face Guilford
in their ﬁfth conference match of the
season. The match got off to a rough
start as Guilford quickly opened a
sizeable lead, but the Generals re-

mained unfazed. Down 27-19, the
Generals won a side out and junior
Jess Ulrich served ten in a row to
steal the ﬁrst game for W&L, 30-
27.

Guilford stayed close early in
game two, but with the score tied 4-
4, the Generals opened up an eight
point lead with a 9-1 run and then
ﬁnished the game 30-16. In game
three, the Generals jumped out
to an early 9-4 lead but Guilford
closed to within two points at 10-8.
The Generals responded with a 9-3
run to go up 19-11 and were never
threatened again, winning the ﬁnal
game 30-21. The Generals were led
by junior Laura Maurer’s 13 kills
and Stevens’ 25 assists.

On Friday and Saturday, the
team participated in the Averett
Invitational, taking on ODAC ri-
val Randolph-Macon, host Averett,
Queens, and Greensboro.

On Friday evening, the Gener-
als opened with a quick 3-0 sweep
of the Yellow Jackets of Randolph-
Macon. The Generals became pro-
gressively more dominant, winning

by a score of 30-24, 30-23, 30-17.
Sophomore Rachael Phillips led the
way with 16 kills and eight digs and
Maurer chipped in 18 digs in addi-
tion to six kills.

The Generals would be glad
their ﬁrst match was only three
games because the nightcap against
Averett would go the distance. The
match was back and forth through-
out. After dropping the ﬁrst game
27-30, the Generals fought back
to take the second game 30-21, the
only game of the match decided by
more than three points.

However, the Cougars refused to
roll over and die, clawing their way
to a 30-28 win in the third game to
put them just one away from the
victory. However, the Generals dug
in and won the fourth game by the
same score and then sealed the win
with a 16-14 ﬁfth game victory.

Splitting time at setter, Stevens
and senior Lauren Rudolph com-
bined for 56 assists and 35 digs.
Phillips and Maurer continued their
strong play, tallying 20 and 16 kills,
respectively. Senior Jess Hudock

also added ﬁve aces to go along
with 14 kills and 17 digs.

In the morning, the Gener-
als awoke to take on Queens and
Greensboro. In the morning match-
up, the Generals downed the Royals
of Queens in three games. After a
relatively easy ﬁrst game win, 30-
14, the Royals awoke but came up
short, losing the second game, 31-
29. Their spirits crushed, the Gener-
als cruised to a 30-17 win in game
three, sealing the 3-0 victory.

The Generals carried the mo-
mentum into the second match
of the day against the Pride of
Greensboro, downing them in three
straight: 30-23, 30-19, 30-23.

On Saturday, offensively the
Generals were led by Maurer’s 22
kills and Hudock’s 19 kills while
Rudolph and Stevens amassed 37
and 36 assists, respectively. Defen-
sively, Maurer’s 19 digs were tops
for the Generals.

The Generals return to action this
Tuesday at the Warner Center when
they take on ODAC rival Roanoke
at 6:30 p.m.

Men extend unbeaten streak to eight

By Michael Keenan

Washington and Lee’s men’s
soccer team chalked up vic-
tories over in-town rival D-I
Virginia Military Institute and
ODAC rival Roanoke.

On Wednesday afternoon,
the Generals welcomed VMI to
Watt ﬁeld for the 35th meeting
between the two teams.

The Generals struck quickly.
Less than ﬁve minutes into the
contest, junior Tommy Pignatel-
li’s shot was deﬂected to senior
Jack Palmer, who ﬁnished the
close range opportunity. The
Generals kept up the pressure
through the ﬁrst half, ﬁring 15
more shots, but failing to add a
second goal.

Just three minutes into the
second half, the Generals struck
again when Pignatelli scored a
goal of his own off another de-
ﬂection to extend the lead to
2-0.

In the 73rd minute, Pi gnatel-
li’s comer kick was ﬁnished by
senior Travis Short to extend
the lead for the ﬁnal time to 3-
0.

The win gave W&L their
ﬁrst victory over VMI since
2001 and improved their head-
to-head record to 17-14-4.

On Saturday, the Gener-
als took on the Maroons of
Roanoke in a battle of two top
ODAC teams.

Roanoke’s Michael Rouha-
na was shown a red card in the
32nd minute, forcing his team
to play down a man for the re-
mainder of the match. However,
the best chance of the ﬁrst half
still belonged to Roanoke when
a shot clanked off the inside of
the post.

It wasn’t until the 57th min-
ute that senior Jack Palmer
scored an unassisted goal to
give the Generals a 1-0 advan-
tage, which they clung to for
the rest of the game.

The loss was Roanoke’s ﬁrst
in conference play this seaon,
while the Generals improved to
7-1-2., 4-0-1 in ODAC.

The Generals return to ac-
tion on Wednesday when they
travel to play Ferrum at 4:00
p.m.

Junior Kiki Moreo makes a save with six seconds remaining
in the game to preserve the win. The shutout was her 31st,
making Moreo the all-time leader in shutout wins at W&L.

Women tally two more shutout
wins over Guilford and CN U

to play, junior Marisa Van Brunt
headed home a Katie Kern corner
kick to make the ﬁnal score 4-0.

On Saturday; the women
struck quickly when Van Dev-
ender passed to Kern, who found
the back of the net less than six
minutes into the game.

The rest of the game proved to
be a defensive struggle, with nei-
ther team scoring in the remain-
der of the game.

Junior Kiki Moreo played the
entirety of both games, tallying
six saves and was credited with
the two shutout wins. The two
victories gave Moreo her 30th
and 31st shutout wins of her ca-
reer, which moved her into ﬁrst
all-time at W&L in that category.

on Tuesday when they take on

Though the Quakers were able

Junior Kate Corr started the scor-
ing less than ﬁve minutes into the

The N ei1(l)s
break down the
ﬁrst four weeks

of the NFL
Season

By Neill Thupari and Neil Sheaffer
STAFF WRITER AND GUEST WRITER

What are the best and worst surprises thus far in
200 7?

NT: Best surprise this year for me has got to be the revival
of the Green Bay Packers. For anyone who has seen Brett Favre
in the mid 90’s during his prime, it is absolutely invigorating to
see him leading a contender once again. I only hope that they can
continue their success and ﬁnd a running game to complement
Favre’s gunslinger mentality. Being from Baltimore and having
to hear the non-stop commentary from Ravens fans with Super-
Bowl aspirations, I have to mention them as being one of, if not
the, worst surprise this year. Highly overrated, the Ravens are 2-2
coming off a loss to Cleveland; and if they do not right the ship in
the upcoming weeks, Brian Billick will immediately be placed on
the hot seat after failing to build on the success of last year’s AFC
North Champion squad.

NS: l’ve been pretty negative about the NFL this year, so it’s
tough for me to think of a pleasant surprise, so I’m going to start
negative. Worst surprise: the San Diego Chargers. They abso-
lutely stink, and this is coming with someone who would take
multiple bullets for LaDainian. I think plenty [read: all] of the
blame should fall on the coaching staff because they were work-
ing with almost the complete roster from last year’s team that
went 14-2. There are reasons that Ted Cottrell and Norv Turner
were unemployed last season. Okay, now for my best surprise. I
haven’t ever really liked Tony Romo, maybe because he plays for
the Cowboys and maybe because he made the Pro Bowl roster
after only playing half a season, but the guy is legitimately good.
And that’s a surprise to me. I always ﬁnd it odd that a guy like
him can ﬂy so far under the radar for a while and then suddenly
be an upper tier player. How does this happen? It’s not like he got
that much better while sending in the signals to Drew Bledsoe.

Which teams’ record doesn’t accurately- reﬂect theirn
.-oath,

overall performance?

NT: I feel that something has to be said here for your Char-
gers, Neil. Yes, San Diego is 1-3, and yes, they don’t appear to
have the hunger they did last year, but this is still the Chargers
team that was an absolute juggernaut last year on their way to a
14-2 record. They are insanely talented on both sides of the ball,
and if the coaching staff can get it together and make the players
believe in the Norv Turner and his assistants they can still turn it
around. Phillip Rivers at QB. Reigning MVP LaDainian Tomlin-
son. Antonio Gates as the best downﬁeld tight end in the league.
A defensive attack led by Shawne Merriman that possesses the
ability to play physical and shut down any offense that comes its
way. These don’t sound like the ingredients to a 1-3 team, and I
don’t think it has to stay that way.

NS: I think it will stay that way. With Norv Turner as their’

coach the Chargers will not win more than 6 games. As for a team
whose record is nowhere near where it should be: Tampa Bay.
They are awful. Or at least they should be awful. If I were a fan/
coach/teammate, I would not want my team’s destiny in Jeff Gar-
cia’s hands. Yes, the guy tends to win, but I still don’t know how.
I think he’s the quarterback that we all saw in Detroit a couple
years ago. They deﬁnitely aren’t going to stick around at 3-1. The
Cadillac is out of commission for the year and their starting left
tackle Luke Petitgout is also on the injured reserve list.

Who is the league MVP thus far?

NS: Randy Moss. In my mind, this is a very simple pick. He
and the Patriots are playing at a whole different level than any
team in the NFL, and he is the primary reason. True, they’ve
won a few SuperBowls without any deep receiving threat. True,
Tom Brady makes almost anybody he plays with a lot better, but
in this case it is Randy Moss that is making Brady better. This is
the best Patriots team that I’ve ever seen, and I think they have
a legitimate shot to go undefeated. I’m going to quickly touch
on Moss’ stats before I turn this over to Neill for his round of
Moss bashing. He has 505 yards and 7 touchdowns. He is going
to threaten or break every major, single season receiving record.
Moss is a player that a quarterback can put complete faith in as he
is still one of the fastest receivers in the league and his hands are
unparalleled. If they win the Super Bowl this year, most of the
credit needs to go to Moss. . .and this is coming from a Michigan
fan that basically worships Tom Brady. . .so there.

NT: I cannot believe you actually think Randy Moss is this
year’s MVP. I suppose the fact that he has been an absolute head-
case for the majority of his career and all of a sudden buckles
down and appears disciplined has nothing to do with the fact that
Brady is his quarterback. Tom Brady has already built a dynasty
in New England with three Super Bowls and two Super Bowl
MVPs, and at the end of his career when all is said and done, he
may be the best quarterback to have ever played the game. If you
take out Tom Brady and put an average or mediocre QB in the
Patriots scheme, what’s their record right now? 2-2? 3-1, at best,
with no real shot at the Super Bowl without Brady at the helm?
Would Randy Moss even be able to play for another QB? Now,
let’s take Randy Moss out of the equation and let’s substitute Wide
Receiver Vincent Jackson from the San Diego Chargers. The Pa-
triots would still be 4-0, Vincent Jackson’s stats would be through
the roof as well, catapulting him into the top 5 for widereceivers,
and the Patriots would be on their way to another Super Bowl
with Tom Brady as their leader. As quarterback, Brady has to take
care of every single aspect of his offense when they’re on the
ﬁeld and he must make the according decisions to lead his team
to victory. Without Brady, there is no Moss. Without Moss, Brady
is still the premier quarterback in the NFL. Tom Brady is the MVP
right now; to even consider someone else is sheer lunacy.

Catholic is last Second prayer falls incomplete .

By Brian Devine
SPORTS WRITER

Washington and Lee football was
picked second in the ODAC preseason
poll primarily based on the strength of its
defense. The ﬁrst two games of the 2007
season showed why.

The Boys in Blue gave up 122 yards to
Franklin and Marshall, then an outstand-
ing 79 yards to a highly touted Averett
squad. Last week’s 322-yard, 42-point
drubbing at the hands of Randolph-Ma-
con had fans wondering, was this an aber-
ration or the defense’s true colors?

On homecoming weekend, in front
of another loud and supportive crowd at
Wilson Field, the Generals sent a clear
message.

The Blue Menace is back and open for
business.

The visiting Catholic University Car-
dinals gained just 45 yards rushing, and
the Generals got their ﬁrst conference
win of the year, 28-21. The visitors went
three-and-out on eleven of their twenty
total drives of the game and were shut
out until 1:20 left in the second quarter.
In the second half Cardinal quarterback
Keith Ricca began to ﬁnd the holes in the
Generals’ zone, defense and ﬁnished with
227 yards passing. Ricca was unable to
pull his team to victory though he came
close.

Down two touchdowns with 33 sec-
onds to go, Ricca led his team 65 yards
on ﬁve plays for a 27-yard touchdown
pass to Miles Sabrick. Just ﬁve seconds

remained on the clock, the Cardinals now
down just seven points. The ensuing on-
side kick was successﬁil and Ricca had
the chance to snatch victory from the
jaws of defeat, but his Hail Mary pass
was knocked down in the end zone.

As fans started to celebrate the narrow
victory, referee Jeff Shears threw a ﬂag
for a questionable late hit on Ricca. This
gave the visitors one last untimed play to
score from the hosts’ 39-yard line. Ricca
was hit by Britt Jamison and dropped the
football. Catholic offensive lineman Rich
Brennan picked it up and began rumbling
toward the end zone. He was stopped by
Bryant Fulk just 22 yards from pay dirt,
and the win was preserved by one touch-

' down.

Catholic’s late-game heroics aside, the
Blue Menace defense was near-perfect.
Catholic’s ﬁrst two touchdowns came
off short drives after two successive R.J.
Varner interceptions late in the ﬁrst half.
Those interceptions helped Catholic turn
a 10-0 deﬁcit into a 14-10 halftime lead.

When the visitors were not gifted with
ﬁeld position, they were mostly unable to
gain yards against Fulk (9 tackles), Scott
Russell (9 tackles, 1 sack) and Mark
Snoddy, who ﬁnally caught an intercep-
tion after recording nine last season.

Vamer’s consecutive interceptions
were the only taint on an excellent perfor-
mance by the Generals’ offense. Tailback
Tom “Chico” Pacicco, fresh off three
100-yard games in a row, set a career best
with 195 yards and one touchdown on

35 carries. “Chico” has improved every
game this season and has quickly become
a fan favorite after spending most of last
season as a backup to the now-graduated
Colton Ward.

Because of the consistent powerful
running of his backﬁeld partner, Varner
was called on to pass only 19 times all
game. He completed seven ofthose pass-
es for 104 yards and one touchdown, to
backup tight end Jason Bacaj, but threw
multiple interceptions for the second
game in a row. Cardinals cornerback
Achilie Kolla shut down W&L’s Jack
Martin, limiting the star wideout to just
three catches and 65 yards and snapping
his streak of consecutive games with a
touchdown at three.

So the “J -Mart” chants from the crowd
were replaced with “Chico” for this game.
and the Generals players and coaches
again acknowledged the loud, standing
section at the 50-yard line at the conclu-
sion of the game. Most of the capacity
crowd again left at halftime, but most of
the alumni seemed to stick around even
after the halftime festivities. The vast ma-
jority of students missed out on the most
exciting ﬁnish to any game this year. in
two weeks, the Boys in Blue will host
their biggest ODAC rival, the Bridgewa-
ter Eagles, on Parents Weekend. This will
undoubtedly be the most important game
of the year for the Generals, and hopeful-
ly students will stick around for the ﬁnish
as a loud and enthusiastic crowd never
goes amiss.
