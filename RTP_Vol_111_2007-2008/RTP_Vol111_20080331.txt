Administration :9 master plan

ﬁnally complete; incoming class
ready to kill fun at W&L

By Hadley Burgoyne
surr wnnrn

They may be prone to bouts
of excessive drinking and pos-
sible drug use while visiting, but
the Washington and Lee Class of
2012 is already making a name
for itself.

The entering class announced
on its Facebook group yesterday
that it had successfully created a
cure for most common cancers.

The project is expected to gen-
erate enormous revenue, and the
entering class says it plans to use
the money to buy Davidson Park
and Red Square away from the
school and the fratemities.

“We think that the Greek sys-
tem is outdated,” one member
of the incoming class said. “We
would instead like to make Red
Square a sober activity center
where everyone goes home by
midnight, so they can get plenty
of rest for class the next day.”

Plans for Davidson Park are
still a bit shaky, but the class will
probably demolish the fraternity
houses and build a scientiﬁc re-
search center where the houses

once stood.

“I mean, what’s the point of
Davidson Park anymore?” the
student asked. You’ve already
got the Kappa Sig house empty,
and SAE is going to be empty
next year. Building a center for
global warming research and let-
ting Al Gore move in to Lexing-
ton just makes more sense. Come
on, we all know that the most im-
portant thing here is making lots
of money and giving the school
another excuse to raise tuition
prices again.”

Dean of Admissions William
Hartog said he was proud of the
accomplishments of the incoming
class.

“As you know, Washington
and Lee received a record num-
ber of applications, and this is the
most competitive class yet. So
what I’m basically trying to say
is that all the people we’ve let in
before are stupid idiots who drink
too much and can’t hold a candle
to the new class.”

When asked for his reaction to
Hartog’s comments, history pro-
fessor H.P. Porter, Jr. just shook
his head and walked away with-

This once beautiful fraternity house will be destroyed to make way for a sober activiy location sponsored
by the Class of 2012.

out saying anything. His actions
spoke far louder than words.
Greek residents of Davidson
Park refused to comment about
the hostile takeover, but several
fraternities were being surround-

tory. There was speculation,
however, that the fraternity was
already trying to end that streak
last month when it hosted a tequi-
la party for the 17- and 18-year-
old Johnson Scholars who were

a sober activity center where everyone goes

home by midnight, so they can get plenty of

rest for class the next day. ”

ed by sandbags, signaling that
the Class of 2012 may be resisted
by force. All members contacted
said they wanted to talk but would
be kicked out of their fraternity by
the school/nationals/the housing
corps if they dared to break the
vow of silence around the latest
hazing investigation.

The destruction of Phi Kappa
Psi’s Davidson Park house will
leave the fraternity, Washington
and Lee’s oldest, off campus for
the ﬁrst time in its 152 year his-

visiting campus.

Faculty members of the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee is ecstatic
about the new plan.

“It’s no secret that we hate the
Greek scene,” one faculty mem-
ber said. “All you students do is
get drunk and go hook up with
each other. Then you skip my 9
a.m. class or show up so hung-
over that you have to put your
head down on the desk or run out
every 10 minutes to puke. I’m
happy that I’ll ﬁnally have stu-

dents who are more interested in
having deep, philosophical dis-
cussions with me.”

The SAC has also been busy

punishing fraternities, so the end.

of the Greek system will relieve
their workload.

“With Davidson Park out of
the way, the only fraternities left
are FIJI and Chi Psi,” said SAC
chair and Dean of Students Dawn
Watkins. “It’s just a matter of
time before the FIJIS do some-
thing that we can frame them for,
and I’m sure we can build a case
against Chi Psi by arguing that
dancing on the bar at late night is
highly dangerous. This should be
a piece of cake.”

Alumni could not be reached
for comment, mainly because all
of them dropped dead of a heart
attack when they heard the news.
A loud humming noise was also
heard in the basement of Lee Cha-
pel. The source of the noise could
not be immediately veriﬁed, but
paranormal experts think it was
probably Robert E. Lee spinning
in his grave.‘

  Is something in the campus water?

Ruscio goes crazy and ﬂees after the Bracket and DT F list make him hate his new job

By Dan Thomas Farragut
surr wrmzn

Two years after Lexington’s
water treatment plant failed its
annual health inspection, city
and university oﬂicials are
worried that the water is un-
safe once again.

The concerns came after a
strange wave of mental prob-
lems swept over the Wash-
ington and Lee campus this
winter. The normal cries of ci-

vility, diversity and honorabil-

ity have been replaced by the
screaming catty girls arguing
over who really are Down To
F***'

Dana Smith, the normally
placid director of sorority life,
was seen wandering around
muttering, “I thought this sort
of stuff only happened in fra-
ternities. I don’t understand
what happened.”

It is" currently unknown if
the list’s author drank bottled
water or had been using the

city water supply. Since she
has left town, health depart-
ment officials are struggling
to complete the necessary test-
ing.
President and chief broad-
cast mail writer Ken Ruscio
was unavailable for comment.
There were unsubstantiated ru-

As he left his ofﬁce, Ruscio
had the following statement
for a Phi reporter who was
on the scene: “I came to Lex-
ington to run a college, not a
P“**ing middle school. This is
absurd.”

Provost June Aprille was
reported to have ﬂed as well,

“I came to Lexington to run a col-
lege, not a ]‘***ing middle school.

This is absurd ”

 

mors that he had read the list,
thrown his hands up in disgust
and simply ﬂed for Richmond.
Students on the University
of Richmond campus report
that an unshaven man with a
rumpled suit had been seen
wandering the campus over
the weekend, but it was not
immediately clear if this was
Ruscio.

following Ruscio back to
Richmond just nine months
after she followed him to Lex-
ington.

During Ruscio’s absence,
the school is under the leader-
ship of history professor Jef-
ferson Davis Futch.

“I think there’s a simple
solution to this,” Futch told a
group of male history majors.

“If we went back to being all
male, we could send these lists
out about Sweet Briar and H01-
lins girls without anyone ever
knowing. I’m telling you, all
these problems started when
we let in those girls.”

Phi Kap members said they
had been bewildered to receive
the list.

“I don’t get it,” said one
Phi Kap senior. “Did this girl
think we were really too stupid
to ﬁgure out which girls want
to hang out with us?”

The Geology department
reported that there was a 4.2
magnitude earthquake last
week. The seismic activity
was attributed to the force of
1700 jaws hitting the ground
as students read the infamous
list. ‘

W&L doctor Jane Horton
urged students to use caution

until tests of the city’s water
supply are ﬁnished.

“Obviously something is
in the water, so please just
drink bottled products over the
next few days,” Horton said.
“We’re very committed to the
health and safety of students,
so please be assured that we’ll
get this bizarre illness ﬁgured
out. Of course, there is one so-
lution to this whole issue. You
all could quit being mean ba-
bies and learn to get along with
one another.”

Faced with Horton’s sug-
gestion, students shrugged
their shoulders.

“Why shouldn’t we know
who’s DTF,” one junior male
asked. “It makes things easier
when I go out. Besides, guys
like seeing girls ﬁght with each
other. It’s fun to watch.”

Have you seen this man? he may have fled to Rich-
mond after W&L students continued to act like
12-year-olds on a daily basis.

Baner quits W&L to take job   '

as new Lexington police ofﬁcer

By Davld Van Patten
STAFF WRITER

Tired of having to jump the
dead batteries of fancy student
cars, long-time Washington and
Lee security guard Thomas “Ba-
ner” Bane announced yesterday
that he is resigning from the
W&L security force and taking an
immediate job as a patrol officer
with the Lexington Police Depart-
ment.

“The decision was really
simple,” Baner said. “As a Lex-
ington officer, I can carry a gun,
which Mike [Young, Director of
Public Safety] would never let me

I’m quitting

By PauIA|len
surr wanna

A senior member of the
powerful Student Recruitment
Committee resigned from the
committee Monday, creating a
media ﬂurry outside the Admis-
sions Ofﬁce House.

The former SRC member,
Skip Hockenpayne (R-Ala-
bama), cited the recent wave of
scandals that have been rocking
Washington & Lee as his rea-
son for stepping down.

“After Bracketgate, I was
determined to push on and
continue the important job of
recruiting students to this ex-
tremely prestigious institution,”
said a teary-eyed Hockensmith,
his Sweet Briar import-girl-
friend standing next to him.

“But after the recent events
of DTFgate, I’ve lost faith in
the legitimacy of this commit-
tee and being a W&L student
in general,” said Hockensmith.
“I mean, how can we as SRC
members allow ourselves to
perpetuate this lie that Wash-
ington and Lee is a place of
civility? I can’t bring myself to
lie to another high school pros-

 

do around campus. I’m going to
have a great time ﬁring warning
shots when I get a noise complaint
down in Red Square.”

Baner said he was also excited
to stop driving around a silly, grey
SUV.

“I mean, the security jeeps
weren’t terrible, but they don’t
have any sirens. How on Earth
can I zoom around the parking
garage when I don’t even have
lights or a siren on top of my
W&L security vehicle?”

Baner, a long-time student
favorite, faces an uncertain re-
ception when he comes back

onto campus wearing the blue
uniforms of Lexington’s (not-so)
ﬁnest. Some students say they’ll
be happy to have a familiar face
on the police force, while others
worry that he’ll be corrupted by
the mean members of the police
force.

“I don’t know what to think,”
one senior said. “On the one
hand, it’s hard to see Baner ﬂip-
ping out and charging everyone
who talks back to him with as-
sault on a police officer. But on
the other hand, something about
the badge and gun in this town
makes people go crazy.”

Members of Phi Kappa Sigma
fraternity have such a close re-
lationship with Baner that they
made him an honorary member
several years ago. Now, the fra-
ternity is unsure of what to do
with the man they thought of as
almost a father ﬁgure.

“He sold out, no question
about it,” one Phi Kap told the
Phi. “We are just totally blown

. away by this move; we never saw

it coming.” '

Police Chief Steve Crowder
said he was excited by the newest
addition to his staff.

“Baner has been around this

town forever,” Crowder said. “He
knows where all the parties are,
where all the drugs are hidden on
campus. You name it, he knows
about it. I’m hoping that this will
really help us increase our arrests

of students, and that revenue will '

help us get more shiny equipment
like the tasers we got to shoot
W&L students wit .”

The tasers, purchased last year,
were given to ofﬁcers so they
could shock drunk and unruly
students around town. Crowder
told his oﬁicers that tasers are
preferable to real guns because
they “aren’t as messy, and prob-

ably lead to fewer lawsuits.”

Baner said that even though
he’s wearing a new uniform, driv-
ing a new car and finally carrying
a gun, he’ll be the same security-
minded person he always is.

“I think I’ll keep my old W&L
ticket book,” he said. “That way,
if I see you parked in the wrong
W&L parking lot, I can give you

a city ticket and a W&L ticket at I

the same time. And because I’ve
got a gun on my hip, students are
probably going to argue a lot less
with me about the extra charges.”

pect, and I won’t.”

Hockensmith said that in the
wake of his resignation, he in-
tends to spend some more time
with his family, frat brothers,
and keg-a-rator.

Hockensmith’s resignation
is the only the latest in a recent
wave of trouble for Washington
& Lee students.

In recent months there have
been numerous calls for the res-
ignations of various students by
the pundits and public alike.

The student body has also
seen its approval ratings plum-
met, meanwhile, while only one
or two of the scandal-plagued
student body members have
stepped down.

Among the student com-
mittees hit the most hard by
the wave of scandals are the
Trident, fraternities, and so-
rorities. There have also been
rumblings of an independent
counsel investigation into the
drinkers, smokers, and tokers.

“I think there is deﬁnitely
a sentiment right now that the
student body isn’t being very
responsible,” said student
Hannah-Elizabeth-Sarah-Jes-

sica Albridge (R — Mississippi).

“I’ll admit that if you look
at what we’ve accomplished
this last term, and it’s not very
promising.”

Albridge cited the recent
100th Mock Convention as the
key achievement of the 259th
Student Body so far this year.

“But even that seemed like
a temporary ﬁx to our college’s
sliding reputation,” said Al-
bridge, pointing out that the
student body still hasn’t shown
any of the promised leader-
ship it gained admission on in
the areas of academic achieve-
ment, character development,
or athletic prowess.

“And I think a lot of my
peers across the Hill will agree
that you don’t want to begin the
discussion on how badly we’re
doing on the diversity issue,”
said Albridge.

With sliding approval num-
bers for the more senior mem-
bers of the Student Body, many
analysts are predicting nearly
a fourth of the current student
body won’t return to the Hill in
the fall.

“There’s deﬁnitely a strong
crop of challengers looking to
knock the incumbent seniors

Student says he can ’t save W&L ’s reputation

out of their seats,” said Admis-
sions Dean William Hartog.
Hartog predicted that only a
few of the incumbent seniors

‘would be able to retain their
seats going into the new year,

but that even these would have
little chance of doing much
more than serving out the year
in obscurity.

“It’s a culture of corruption,”
said one urmamed-student body
insider. -

“You hear all the time about
people going to the Hill with
all these ambitions and dreams.
But it doesn’t last. I’d say that
almost all of them are into
drinking and drugs and God-
knows what else by the time
they leave.”

“I think that’s why you see
the public losing faith in the
people up on the Hill. When
you’ve got so many alcoholics
it’s bad enough. But throw in
stuff like Bracketgate and DT-
F gate? It’s too much.”

The latest Gallup poll shows
public approval of Student
Body behavior is at 23%, with
no margin of error.

This past weekend the members of
the Washington and Lee Rowing team
traveled for their ﬁrst duel race in 50
years. Quietly under thecover of night
they departed on Friday morning with
their dilapidated boat strapped down to
their rusting hulk of a truck. The des-
tination was Cambridge, Mass. They
arrived at‘ the Harvard’s Newell Boat
House, late Friday, where two weeks
before the coach Harry Parker dis-
patched a challenge.

Defending National Champion
Harvard ranked number one in the na-
tion preseason, has already disposed
of Princeton, Cal and Wisconsin, this
season, presented a huge opponent for
the generals. The men of the Washing-
ton and Lee team have been practicing
constantly on the Maury since early
December, in hopes of this being their
break out year. ‘ ‘

For Harvard this race was seen as a
joke, a tune up before gearing up for a
ﬁnal push to Olympic preparation. Ac-
cording to Harvard stroke, Smithe Mos-

ingly Doosheington VI, “we wanted to
race the little sisters of the poor for
once. Occasionally we like to see how
the other 99.99% of the nation lives. I
expect this will be quite the show, and
I will be sitting in my ascot at the Fly
Club before they even ﬁnish.”

The Harvard Coach said, “Occa-
sionally I like to just beat up little kids
in order to feel superior about myself.
That is why Iinvited them this week-
end, we just want to beat up on some
hillbillies and rednecks."

This View was surely not enhanced
by Generals puling up to the boathouse
in their rusted truck, which promptly
died in the parking lot. »

Lacking money to stay in a hotel,
the W&L menslept on the ﬂoor of the
boathouse. Yesterday morning the two
teams took to the water is what was
supposed to be a one sided drubbing.
But off the start the Harvard Men were
shocked.

Over the 2000 meter course,,the.

W&L team surged out to an incredible
lead. By the halfway point of the race
the W&L team held a commanding
lead of over 10 boat lengths and a lead

of over a minute. Coming into the last
400m of the race the W&L men did not
even raise their game for a sprint since
they had lostsight of Harvard.*The ﬁnal
margin of victory for the Generals was
2:32 and a margin of 30 lengths, as a
desponded Harvard Coach announced
was , “the curvature of the earth”.

Not even stopping to celebrate of
rest the W&L men rowed back to the
boathouse and in true W&L fashion
changed into their blazers and went
down to the dock to greet their oppo-
nents. A
According to one former Olympian
who watched the race, it was “perhaps
one of the greatest upsets in the history
of sports!” ‘

The team returned to Lexington qui-
etly last night to begin preparation for
their next big test, the Olympics. Last
week the team received notice from the
International Olympic Committee that
they would not be allowed to represent
the Confederate States of America in
the next Olympiad. The team is now
weighing their option of whether to
represent the United States or not. Tri»
als are scheduled to begin this Friday.

SAC issues
frat verdicts

Phi Psi and KA placed on
critical probation for Johnson
Scholar controversy and hazing

By Robert Wason
STAFF WRITER

The Student Affairs Committee recently concluded its
investigations of Phi Kappa Psi and Kappa Alpha Order and
.sued its verdicts in a hearing last Wednesday. These pun-
ishments were handed out in response‘ to hazing violations
committed by KA and for the Johnson scholar candidate
controversy surrounding Phi Psi.

"According to the Washington and Lee University web-
site, which enables students to view the ﬁnal decisions of
the SAC, Phi Psi has been placed on “Critical Social Proba-
tion” for one calendar year. This is a punishment that nor-
mally coincides with “a second offense under the University
initiatives of alcohol and other drugs.”

Phi Psi has also been asked to provide the SAC with a
“revised organization reform proposal” by Thursday.

KA, which was recently found guilty of hazing viola-
tions, is now on “Critical Probation,” meaning that the fra-
ternity will be considered for suspension if any other major
violations are committed before the end of the next calendar
year.

“The proactive responses by KA and
fhi Psi leadership exempliﬁz the ide-
als of student self—governance at
W&L. It is an indication that students
are willing to take responsibility for
their actions and learn from their

mistakes. ”
CHRIS WORNOM, IFC Presldent

During this time, KA will be closely monitored by both
the Interfratemity Council (IFC) and the SAC to ensure its
compliance with the rules and policies of Kappa Alpha Or-
der’s National Administrative Ofﬁcc, the standards of W&L
and Virginia state laws. ’

SAC members were unable to divulge further informa-
tion concerning the proceedings of their hearing.

The university website speaks highly of KA’s coopera-
tion, commending it as an ideal model of “collaboration
between the national organization, the local chapter, the In-
terfratemity Council and the University.”

IFC President and SAC member Chris Womom empha-
sized the importance of this productive group effort.

“The proactive responses by KA and Phi Psi leadership

’xemplify the ideals of student self-govcmance at W&L,”
he said. He added, ‘‘It is an indication that students are will-
ing to take responsibility for their actions and learn from
their mistakes.”

Phi Psi President Carson Brunoresponded to the SAC
decision in an e-mail statement.

“The SAC’s decision to uphold the IFC’s recommenda-
tion of Critical Social Probation was fair and understand-
able,” Bruno said in his e-mail. “This was not what I had
expected to have to deal with when I became president, but
now, I think this will help us become a stronger house as we
make changes.”

Dean of Freshman David Leonard also emphasized the '

' portance of creating a hazing-free model of New Member
Education. When asked to comment on the current state of
Greek Life, he said that “the ‘beyond-the—classroom’ experi-
ence is improving at Washington and Lee.”

Although he expressed satisfaction concerning the effi-
ciency of student self-govemance that was demonstrated by
the SAC trials of Phi Psi and KA, Leonard offered a word of
caution to the Greek Community.

“Washington and Lee University is very serious about
ensuring the health and safety of its students, and when in-
dividuals and organizations do things that are not congruent
with University standards, they will be held accountable,”
he said.

As students are ﬁnalizing their

living arrangements for next year ‘

and, in some cases, lamenting the
results of V the lottery for on-cam-
pus housing, there has been a lot
of buzz surrounding the recent
changes that have been made to the
housing scene.

David Leonard, Associate Dean
of Student Affairs and Dean of
Freshmen, explained in detail the
speciﬁc adjustments students can
expect in the coming academic
year. He made it clear that while
there have been several shifts in
the housing plans, there is no rea-
son to worry.

‘”l‘here’s not a shortage,” Leon-
ard said. “It’s not as if we have to
triple [roommates]” or ﬁnd over-
ﬂow housing. -

Due to upcoming renovations
to buildings on the Colonnade,

Baker Hall, currently a freshman
residence hall, will be transformed
into offices for displaced faculty
members. Consequently, the en-
tire ground ﬂoor of Gaines Hall
and some additional space on the
second ﬂoor will be devoted to
ﬁrst—year student housing. Leonard
predicts that about one ﬁfth of next
year’s freshman class will live in
Gaines. A

To combat the stress that these
changes could cause in providing
housing for upper~division stu-
dents, a “small scattering of suites”
in Woods Creek East, formerly
reserved entirely for law students,
has been opened to undergradu-
ates. The building will still, how-
ever, be predominantly assigned to
law students.

“Some students had less of
a chance to live in their No. 1
choice,” said Leonard, explaining
that there has been “a little bit of
dissatisfaction” following the re-

...L

1 Baker Dorm ‘to house faculty oﬁices, additional housing oﬂered in“Gaines and Woods Creek East

sults of the recent housing lottery.
Also to be noted is the fact that
several students who would other-
wise be living in a fraternity house
next year have had to seek housing

, elsewhere.

Residential life “will be a little
more snug this academic year,”
said Leonard. He explained that
there will be much less opportunity
to make room changes after mov-
ing in and advised that students
will have to solve any roommate
problems on their own.

“When there’s not a lot of space
to {switch rooms], it’s amazing
how people learn to get along,” he
said.

Leonard also shared his opti-
mistic plans for greatly improving
residential life in other areas, par-
ticularly for freshmen.

“Twenty to 30 freshmen stu-
dents are typically housed in
Gaines, and most of them feel
rather lonely,” he said. Next year

the residence hall will be home to
80-90 freshmen, and this will help
to “create more of a ﬁrst—year com-
munity in Gaines.”

He noted enthusiastically that
plans are being made to renovate
Gaines, including the Gatehouse,
which will create a refurbished
common area for residents and vis-
itors. The weight room will also be
improved, and Leonard hopes this
will become “one of the primary
social spaces” for residents. Input
for these upcoming projects was
sought from the Residential Life
staff and the Freshman Leadership
Council.

Leonard said he would also like
to facilitate the creation of better
programming and planned activi-
ties for all aspects of on-campus
housing. This would create a better
“feel of community” across resi-
dential life, he said.

Suspected mumps case isolated

Health care professionals urge W&L community to monitor personal health, practice good hygiene

By Grace Wang
NEWS EDITOR

The Student Health Center
warned the W&L community Friday
by e-mail to be wary of a possible
case of mumps after an undergradu-
ate began experiencing symptoms.
Although the Health Center imme-
diately isolated the student, campus
physician Jane Horton said they
did not test for the disease. She
attributes this to the inaccuracy of
mumps testing in Lexington.

Dr. John Sheridan, a physician in
the Emergency Department at Stone-
wall Jackson Hospital, said that he
has not encountered a mumps case
since the 19805.

Dr. Horton conﬁrmed that the
student has now left campus and no
longer poses a threat. She said it is
unlikely that additional cases will
emerge.

According to the Health Center,
the student adhered to university
policy and was fully vaccinated for
mumps, measles and rubella (MMR)
prior to experiencing symptoms.
However, Dr. Horton said that the
MMR vaccination does not always
provide full coverage.

“There’s something about this
strain that has emerged in the past
couple years... Two to ﬁvc percent
[of those vaccinated] may still be

susceptible.”

Dr. Sheridan hypothesized that
this individual was unable to pro-
duce the correct antibodies in re-
sponse to the MMR vaccination.

Similar mumps cases surfaced
about two years ago and resulted
in outbreaks lat several colleges,
including nearby University of Vir-
ginia and the University of Iowa.

The Health Center immediately
notiﬁed close contacts of the symp-
tomatic student, advising them to
monitor their own health in upcom-
ing weeks. Typical symptoms of
the illness include fever, headache,
muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of
appetite.

According to Dr. Horton’s e-mail,
the infected individual can transmit
mumps to an uninfected person from
three days before symptoms appear
to about ﬁve days after symptoms
begin. A person who is exposed to
the virus may not exhibit symptoms
until 16 to 18 days later. However,
this incubation time could be as long
as three weeks.

MMR documentation was then
veriﬁed for these high-risk individu-
als as well as for those lacking both
doses of the vaccine.

Mumps is a viral infection trans-
mitted through shared respiratory
secretions. This can occur readily
when people share food and drink.

Moreover, it is airborne and spread
through skin contact, said Dr. Sheri-
dan.

“The best thing to do is to prac-
tice good hand washing,” he said.
Dr. Horton also recommends cover-
ing coughs and sneezes.

The infection is often character-
ized by swelling of one or more of
the salivary glands, usually of the
parotid glands located within the
cheek and near the jaw line. This
gives infected individuals an ap-
pearance of “chipmunk cheeks.”

However, one third of infections
do not cause apparent salivary gland
swelling and appear as respiratory
tract infections. Severe complica-

      

tions of the illness are also pos-
sible but rare. Dr. Sheridan cited
an important example. “Lymphatic
involvement can spread over the
entire body and cause orchitis, or
swollenness of the testes, in young
men.”

Because mumps is a viral infec-
tion, antibiotic treatment is not use-
ful. Thus, prevention and good hy-
giene are of the utmost importance.

Dr. Horton advises individuals
experiencing any suspicious symp-
toms to seek medical help immedi-
ately. Booster shots for the MMR
vaccination are available through
the Lexington—Rockbridgc Health
Department

‘Reporting back’ to
journa1ism’s roots

W&L hosts spring regional Society of
Professional Journalists conference

By Joel Poelhuls
STAFF WRITER

Journalists from Virginia, Maryland, Delaware
and Washington DC. descended on campus Friday
and Saturday for the Society of Professional Journal-
ists (SPJ) Region II Conference.

SPJ was founded at founded at DePauw Univer-
sity in 1909. It works to advocate free speech and
public information laws as well as to promote dia-
logue about relevant issues within the profession.

The conference included panel discussions, the
Region II Mark of Excellence awards luncheon
and a speech by Democracy Now! journalist Amy
Goodman. Washington and Lee won two Mark of
Excellence Awards, one for the Rockbridge Report
website, and one for inGeneral magazine.

The theme of the conference was “Report Back,”
emphasizing the history of Washington and Lee and
journalism. In 1869, Robert E. Lee decided to offer
50 scholarships to students interested in the profes-
sion of printing and journalism. This is cited as the
ﬁrst journalism program in higher education in the
world.

According to junior Melissa Caron, the treasurer
for the W&L SPJ chapter, it is unusual for a student
chapter to host a regional conference.

“We started planning for it about a year ago,”
Caron said.

At the conference, W&L journalism professor
Edward Wasserrnan unveiled OnPoverty.org, a web-
site created by students and faculty of the journalism
department to provide resources for journalists who
cover issues of poverty, class and economic justice.

Goodman’s speech, which was open to the pub-
lic, covered the failure of mainstream, corporate-
ly-owned media to challenge the powers that be.
Goodman criticized the major news networks for
complicity in the build-up to the war in Iraq. She
also related a story from her own past in which she
and a colleague were beaten by the Indonesian mili-
tary during a protest in East Timor as an example
of how journalists are treated in other parts of the
world. _

A silent auction held during the conference raised
about $450 for the society’s Legal Defense Fund,
which provides ﬁnancial assistance to journalists
facing legal action. Shops in town, area media, and
the W&L bookstore all donated items to the auc-
tron.

Next year’s SPJ conference will be organized by
the professional chapters of Washington, D.C. and
Maryland.

Surviving the aftermath of rape '

Two women share emotional stories, discuss resources available for recovery

By Vlctorla Taylor
smrr wnmzn

Two speakers visited Washington
and Lee last week to address the topic
of sexual assault, speciﬁcally rape, and
its consequences.

Andrea Cooper gave her presen-
tation on Tuesday entitled “Kristin’s
Story” in which she spoke about her
20-year-old daughter who committed
suicide in 1995 after being victimized
by acquaintance rape.

On Wednesday night, Joyce Mc-
Cauley-Benner presented “Victory
Over Violence” as part of the Femi-
nists for Life College Outreach Pro-
gram. McCauley-Benner became
pregnant at the age of 20 and, although
she did not know whether the unborn
child was the result of rape or of her
loving relationship, she decided not to
have an abortion.

Cooper believed that her daughter
suffered from childhood depression
but said that Kristin was happy dur-
ing her teenage years, earning her high
school’s performing arts award. She
began at Baker University, a liberal arts
school in Baldwin City, Kansas with
fewer than 1,000 students in the fall of
1994, where she became a a member
the sorority Alpha Chi Omega.

Kristin once again started showing
signs of depression after her boyfriend
of about a year broke up with her the
following September. According to
Cooper, her daughter seemed to be
back to normal, “almost euphoric,”

> when she came home for Christmas

break. She made plans for New Years
Eve but when Cooper and her husband
returned home at two in the morning,
they saw that all of the lights were on
and that Kristin’s car was still in the
driveway. Once inside, they found
their daughter lying on the ﬂoor with

I a gun in her hand.

“I didn’t see any blood,” said Coo-
per, “and I thank God for that every
day.”

It was only after reading her
daughter’s diary two weeks later that
she learned the cause of her daugh-
ter’s suicide: Kristin had been raped
by a fellow lifeguard at a party that
summer. Upon calling the Alpha Chi
house at Baker, she found out that all
of Kristin’s sorority sisters knew what
had happened, as did her best friend
from high school. Because of these
circumstances, Cooper stressed the
importance of helping friends who are
showing signs of depression.

“My goal is to get people to go to
counseling and get professional help,”
said Cooper, who added that “exten-
sive grief counseling and [her] faith”
are what pulled her through. “Take ad-
vantage of the free services at Wash-
ington and Lee.”

Before she began, Cooper prom-
ised the audience that her talk would
not be a “total downer.”

“I feel that the message I have is
the legacy that Kristin left behind,”
said Cooper.

This was Cooper’s second visit to
W&L’s campus. She also spoke four
years ago and, according to Assistant
Director of Student Activities and
Greek Life Dana Smith, she was “well
received by the student body.”

“It is important for students to hear
a different perspective about rape, de-
pression and suicide to increase un-
derstanding of these complex topics,”
said Smith. “These issues affect so
many college students directly or in-
directly. It is, hopefully, reassuring to
know they are not alone in their reac-
tions, questions and emotions.”

Cooper was a member of Delta
Delta Delta at Florida State University
andjremains an active member of the

Greek community. “Kristin’s Story”
was sponsored by SPEAK, One in
Four, Kappa Kappa Gamma, the Pan-
hellenic Council and the Oﬁice of
Health Promotions.

Students for Life sponsored “Vic-
tory Over Violence,” a talk given
by Feminists For Life of America’s
speaker Joyce McCauley-Benner.
At the age of 20, McCauley-Benner
was raped by a cook at the restaurant
where she was waiting tables. She be-
came pregnant, but until the child was
born, she would not know whether the

I father of the child was her boyfriend

or the rapist.

Living on her own and trying to
support herself through college, she
felt helpless. McCauley-Benner made
what she called a “desperate phone
call home to a friend” who gave Mc-
Cauley-Benner the advice that she
said helped her make up her mind to
keep the baby: “No one emotion will
last forever; an abortion will.”

“That comment hit me like a ton
of bricks,” said McCauley-Benner.
“While I didn’t know who the father
was, I did know who the mother was.
It was me.”

She moved back home and gave
birth to a baby boy, whom she named
Joshua McCauley. He is now eight
years old.

After sharing her story, McCauley-
Benner explained the beliefs of Femi-
nists for Life. Contrary to the common
belief that all feminists must be pro-
choice, FFL is based on the teachings
of the “ﬁrst wave” of feminists like
Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady
Stanton who celebrated “motherhood
as womanhood” and were against
abortion.

She also spoke about the Elizabeth

Cady Stanton Pregnant and Parenting I
Students Act which would provide on- A _

campus support for pregnant and par-
enting students. McCauley-Benner,
who is a college graduate, said she had
a difficult time going back to school
after she gave birth.

“People stared at me like ‘why are
you putting a damper on the party at-
mosphere?”’ she said.

She told the audience that they had
the power to “revolutionize this cam-
pus to empower women” and then
take those skills into the work place
because that’s what is going to “revo-
lutionize America.” She stressed the
importance of providing resources to
college women who experience an un-
planned pregnancy so that they do not
have to choose abortion.

Sophomore Students for Life sec-
retary Sarah Keckler was responsible
for organizing the event, which in-
cluded contacting FFL and sending
out ﬁmdraising letters to local church-
es. She said that there were a number
of speakers that they could choose.

“[McCauley-Benner’s story] was
the one that really stood out,” said Ke-
ckler, “because sexual assault is such
a problem on W&L’s campus. We
thought it would really hit home.”

China’s atrocities
warrant protests

Athletes should speak out at Olympics

By Abel Delgado

§.COLUMNlST

Far too often we equate athletic feats with heroism. We idolize those
who just happen to have the skills we wished we were born with, those
who entertain us with the art of humane competition. Too often we pay

J little attention to the actual heroes.

1 Don’t expect to ﬁnd any heroes at the Beijing Olympics this sum-
mer. The host nation has a policy of silencing the people I like to call
heroes that includes everything from torture to execution. In all its
glory and wisdom, the International Olympic Committee chose China

i to host the world’s most prestigious athletic and cultural gathering de-
- spite the complete lack of respect for human dignity the government

has shown.
The IOC apparently wants us to forget the heroes, to forget the

Buddhist Monks in Tibet who continue to be brutalized by Chinese

occupiers, forget the Darfur rebels who have to watch their children
starve and their women raped by Sudanese forces supported by China,
to forget the reportedly 10,000 Chinese that the Beijing government
executes yearly. The Olympics are no time for politics they say. Appar-
ently they are just the time to glorify a brutal, murderous regime.
Does no one remember 1936? Any person who loves sports has to
cringe when shown the pictures of Hitler’s propaganda machine using
the Berlin Olympics to stir up Nazi Nationalism. It’s no secret that the
2008 Olympics are meant to be a coming out party for China, a country

» that wants to take an even greater place in the world. This was the exact

intention of 1936 and we seem doomed to repeat history. This century,
after all, is supposed to be the “Chinese Century,” and no doubt the
Chinese see their Olympic bid as a legitimization or at least an accep-
tance of their vicious practices by the rest of the world.

And now the heroes, those who ﬁght for human rights and
dignity, some who sacriﬁce their own rights in order to ﬁght
for the freedom of others, are being lambasted and scold-
ed, told they should not dare protest during the Olympics, be-
cause as IOC Chairman Jacques Rogge so pompously puts it,
“It is always sad to see such a ceremony disrupted.”

We are talking about a country that uses execution buses, which
according to Sky News are “ﬁtted with lethal injection equipment, [so]
they can deliver on-the-spot executions.” We are talking about a coun-
try which, according to its own official ﬁgures, executes more people
than the rest of the world put together. We are talking about a country
that gives their full support to the genocide-committing government of
Sudan and to oppressive regimes in Burma, Cuba, and Zimbabwe.

And IOC Chairman says he ﬁnds a little protesting disturbing?
How holding up signs and making a political statement is worse than a
butchering bus is a beyond me.

This is not a call for a total boycott. It would do us little good to
have athletes and nations with a social conscience have a medal count
of zero while those who lack the fortitude to stand by the beaten, down-
trodden and executed get all the glory of Olympic gold. No, we should
all be there and protest.

Forget what China, the IOC and the major corporate sponsors be-

hind the Beijing Olympics want you to believe. Athletes should speak
up against China every time they have microphone in front of them. I
wish we had a Jesse Owens, who just by winning medals heroically
deﬁed the Nazi propaganda of 1936, but we don’t. Instead we need all
who participate to take a stand.
‘ Before the Olympic torch arrives in Beijing, it will pass through
Tibet. It would symbolically ﬁtting if the ﬂame were somehow extin-
guished there, to prove the Olympic spirit and ideals has no doubt been
diminished.

  Outlawirig the slurs

Hate speech proposal pushes for equality, dignity

I am writing in response
to the Ring Tum Phi’s recent
editorial regarding my organi-
zation’s hate speech proposal.
The editors and authors of that
piece have offered a sincere ob-
jection to this proposal based on
student freedom of expression.
However, our proposed policy
leaves student expression fully
intact and works to combat one
of the greatest challenges to our
institution. I admit that I am
largely responsible for some of
the misconceptions because I
did not provide the paper with
a full copy of my proposal that
includes an 18 page memo, and
oral commentary and revision.

The editors also provided
me with a copy of the news
article, though I did not re-
ceive the editorial in advance.
The editors’ understandably
less than complete knowledge
of the proposed policy has led
them to mischaracterize it in a
number of ways, which I now
seek to correct. [Author’s note,
this version is severely abridged
to comply with the Phi’s word
limits. For a full version, please
contact the author: martinjb@
wlu.edu.

The editors discuss at some
length what I “should know”
about the law, freedom of ex-
pression and policy. I wish to
reassure them that I will re-dou-
ble my efforts to ﬁll in the ap-
parent gaps in my knowledge.
Although I am unable to com-
ment on what I should know, I
am able to expose to the reader
a little bit of what I do know:
1) the First Amendment is not
binding upon this university (as
the editors concede) and 2) the
First Amendment does not pro-
vide the range of protection that
the editors assert. As to the ﬁrst
point, ss long as freedom of
expression is conscientiously
preserved and everpresent in
the minds of university deci-
sion-makers, the university is

free to set policy that does not
perfectly ﬁt every contour of
First Amendment law.

Regarding the second point,
the editors give one the im-
pression that the First Amend-
ment always protects certain
words, including racist, sexist,
or homophobic slurs. This is
not true. The First Amendment
does not universally protect or
proscribe particular words. The
Constitution and traditional no-
tions of free speech present a
balance of fundamental rights,
context, and certain compelling
interests of the state. Freedom
of expression does not contem-
plate absolutes, nor does our
policy proposal.

“[n]othing in this section shall
be construed to limit, prevent,
or prohibit free and open class-
room discussion, or the full and
free expression of moral, social,
philosophical, religious, and po-
litical views.” In other words, if
an individual can demonstrate
that the use of hate speech is a
substantial and important part
of their expressive message or
views, she can still escape the
reach of the policy.

The First Amendment al-
lows policy-makers to respond
to compelling harms, as long
as they carefully tailor the re-
sponse to those harms. Our
policy proposal comports with
this principle because there are

How have  people calling the f-word (in

reference to gay people) across the room

enlightened our student population or con-

tributed some new idea to our discourse?

The editors cite multiple im-
portant legal cases to support
their argument, yet the policy
will comply with content neu-
trality principles. In addition,
the editors ignore many cases
that allow the government to
prescribe verbal conduct that is
“no essential part of any expo-
sition of ideas, and are of such
slight social value as a step to
truth that any beneﬁt that may
be derived from them is clearly
outweighed by the social in-
terest in order and morality.”
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942). See
also Wrginia v. Black, 538
U.S. 343 (1996) (allowing the
government to prohibit cross-
burning despite its expressive
content).

The proposal further pro-
tects student expression saying

countless documented harms
of hate speech ranging from
violence, to the creation of a
hostile environment, to public
image consequences, to men-
tal health effects. The policy
responds to the great need to
prevent this harm to university
students. The policy follows the
least restrictive means of doing
so by preserving the content
of message, and as the policy
progresses, it will undoubtedly
feature the tightest possible
deﬁnition of hate speech in its
ﬁnal iteration.

Above all, the editors have
not explained speciﬁcally what
hate speech, in reality, adds to
our discourse. How have the
crowds of people calling the f—
word (in reference to gay peo-
ple) across the room enlight-
ened our student population or

contributed some new idea to
our discourse?

The Ring Tum Phi’s editori-
al insists that our policy would
“force morality” upon univer-
sity students. Nothing could be
further from the truth. The pro-
posed policy does not address
the morality of hate speech,
nor does it require students to
accept that it is immoral. The
policy recognizes the objective
harms to our campus climate
and to our students resulting
from hate speech and addresses
them. This policy, like any oth-
er university policy, does not
impose some sort of “punish-
ment” out of a sense of moral
blameworthiness or character
judgment.

The editors conjure up a
plethora of troubling images
including curfews and single-
sex dorms. These images may
be powerful, but they simply
have nothing to do with our
proposal. To state the obvious,
we have not proposed a single
sex dorm or a curfew. More
fundamentally, those images
reﬂect enforcement of tradi-
tional gender’ norms or views
of late-night activity that bear,
at best, a tangential relation-
ship to some objective danger
to student safety or welfare. By
contrast, our policy directly at-
tacks an identiﬁed, documented
harm. Our proposal has noth-
ing to do with enforcing gen-
der norms or a particular social
viewpoint.

Before we can talk about free
speech, we must have equality
and personal dignity that al-
low all students to contribute to
our community and discourse.
Therefore, my parting image to
the readers is "the image of the
Supreme Court Justices who
decided Brown v. Board of Ed-
ucation. Broadly speaking, this
historic case represents the fun-

See “EQUALITY" on page 6

True diversity needed

Fight hate speech by learning about others, not banning exchange

After reading the Phi’s cov-
erage of all these campus is-
sues over the past two months, I
have felt compelled to share my
disappointment in the way we
have been trying to solve them.
Rather than looking at why our
problems exist and creating an
environment to facilitate health-
ier behavior, we say “Hey, that’s
bad. Don’t do that... or else!”

But this is approach is al-
ways bound to fail. As the edi-
torial piece said last week, “you
can’t teach college students mo-
rality.” We seem to be caught
in a neverending game of
“Whack-a-Mole,” but we need
to think about how to inhibit the
moles from surfacing in the ﬁrst
place.

The recently proposed hate
speech policy sent a shiver down
my spine. The main reason I
came to Washington and Lee is
precisely because we are one of
the few colleges left that does
not have any unconstitutional
speech codes limiting what a
student can and cannot say. I
loathe political correctness and
ﬁrmly believe it prohibits intel-
lectual development. How can
we learn about each other and
the world if we are afraid to say
what is on our minds because
of fear it will offend someone?
When something offends us, it
is because it challenges our be-
liefs—that, to me, is the essence
of learning. V

While I do laud the limiting
of the proposed policy to nar-

rowly deﬁned “hate speech,"
and not “anything found of-
fensive to other students" as
is common in other schools, it
is still impractical. Applying
speech codes without actually
letting students learn about oth-
ers for themselves doesn’t ac-
complish anything. It’s only a
band-aid, not a solution.

We need to have an envi-
ronment that naturally fosters
contact between people of dif-
ferent sex, race, religion, sexual
orientation, etc. Any claims of

graduating devoid of the inter-
cultural exchange essential to
success in today’s globalized
business world.

What better way to under-
stand different types of people
than by living with them? Un-
fortunately, our Greek system
is a natural dividing factor.
The astronomically high cost
of fraternity membership is an
immediate barrier to many stu-
dents here on full scholarship.
With notable exceptions, the
international students are segre-

diversity will be conﬁned only
to numbers seen on paper until
such an environment is created,
and it is simply irresponsible for
the university to advertise and
promote “diversity” without
providing the appropriate forum
for its realization.

If we are truly an institution
that “produces leaders” through
a “liberal arts education for the
21*‘ century,” then we need to
get into the 215‘ century. The fact
that the hate speech policy even
had to be brought up is a clear
indication that our students are

gated from day one, and it only
gets worse from year to year as
they are lumped all together in
university housing while the
wealthy white American popu-
lation lives amongst themselves
in the fraternity scene, deprived
of the potentially wonderful
beneﬁts of intercultural ex-
change.

But it’s not just a “Greek
versus non-Greek” barrier. In-
tegration between fraternities
is even a huge problem. The
sororities, however, are a good
example of how we can have a

Greek system without fewer of
the problems inherent amongst
fraternities in their current in-
carnation. The close physical
proximity is a factor, but what’s
more important is that there are
few enough of them that they
are not in cutthroat competition
all fall term. We have nearly
the same amount of fratemi-
ties as we did when we were
all male, but we have only half
of the number of males to draw
from! As such, there is an in-
credibly unhealthy divisiveness
between houses of males who
would in normal circumstances
be friendly with each other.If
we were somehow able to have
around seven fraternities, this
unnecessary hostility would
disappear and would encourage
more inter-fratemal interaction,
helping to build a stronger over-
all community.

Unfortunately I see no fea-
sible way of going about that
change, but even if it were to
somehow happen, gender rela-
tions would remain an issue.
Let’s face it—this environment
is not at all conducive to the
formation of co-ed groups of
friends. If recent Phi articles
on this topic are any indication,
students overwhelmingly want
more everyday gender interac-
tion.

Well, here’s a solution that
would substantially improve the
predicament: build more dorms,

Vision of equality

Have the courage to protect everyone

-damental notion that, when certain limited expressive values collide
with our society’s dedication to equality, equality must prevail in a
civil and democratic society. Those who opposed integration in Brown
pointed out that they had the right to associate and disassociate with
whomever they wished in order to express their views and their op-
position to desegregation. They asserted their fundamental expressive
rights in opposition to those who worked to end segregation.

Yet the unanimous Court barely made note of these fundamental ex-
pressive concerns because ‘it believed that the paramount value of our
government and our society is equality. The Court endorsed a vision
of equality for all that was not just formal or nominal but substantive,
and it did so in the face of serious expressive concerns. The university
must have the courage to do the same. There are obvious differences
between legally enforced segregation and the tacitly enforced inequali-
ties of this campus, but one cannot help but notice the similarities as
well. On our campus, there are victims of hate speech who cannot ex-
press their views or take full advantage of educational opportunities,
and there are those who, whether intentionally or not, use hate speech
to oppress others while still being free to express their own views.

The university can and should act to end this divide, or “segrega-
tion” if you will, between different groups of students. The university
may have to respect speech, but it also has the highest possible obliga-
tion to provide equal protection and equal opportunity for its students.
We urge all university students to join us in the effort to pass this cru-
cial policy initiative.

More time together

Proposal cure: Two years on campus

continued from page 5

and have students live on campus for two years before moving into
their Greek houses. It’s simply unfair to have one semester to make
your static friendships for all four years of college.

I, for one, wish I had a lot more time to interact and discover before
having everything set in stone by the time pledgeship season rolled
around. Having that one extra year of living with people not in the
same Greek organization will provide a necessary period of interaction
that can only serve to bring the community closer together and contrib-
ute to the true intellectual development of all students.

Living together forces people to gain a deeper understand-
ing of each others’ backgrounds. If we are exposed every day to
different genders, races, religions, sexual orientations, etc. then
it will severely hamper our tendency to engage in hate speech,
rendering the ratiﬁcation of any official policy a moot point.
I’ve spoken to a lot of people who agree with what I’ve said, and I’m
curious to see if more people feel the same way. Whether you share
these sentiments not, I’d like to see what you think. Feel free to email
me, or better yet, send another letter to the editor.

Criteria for selection of Owings Fellows are, ﬁrst of all, that the applicants should possess outstanding per-
sonal integrity. They should be good scholars, but the fellowship is not limited to students with exceptional
grade-point averages. They should be articulate, with some grace and poise in demeanor, while at the same
time being sensitive to the values and opinions of others. They should be students who show promise of de-

veloping into community leaders of high standards.

Applicants may submit their applications to Professor Emeritus Lewis G. John, Department of Politics,
through campus mail. There is no application form, but the application should include:

(1) A copy of the student’s transcript
(2) A resume of activities and special talents

(3) An essay of approximately 250 words with the heading, “How my personal values_and experience
qualify me to represent Washington and Lee as a Cullum Owings ’03 Fellow”

(4) A statement of willingness to make the off-campus visits as described above

(5) Names of two or more members of the faculty from whom the selection committee may seek recom-

mendations

Forgive and forget '

Politicians ’mistakes don ’t aﬂect job performance

By crlghton Allen
STAFF WRITER

On March 17, 2008, David
Paterson was sworn in as the
55th governor of New York fol-
lowing the resignation of the
disgraced Elliot Spitzer after his
involvement with a “high-class”
prostitute ring.

David Paterson is a highly
accomplished man. He holds
degrees from Columbia Uni-
versity and Hofstra University
School of Law. He served with
distinction for many years as a
member of the state Senate and

. served four terms as the Senate

Minority Leader.

Yet, Paterson has many a
skeleton lurking in his closet.
He has engaged in many extra-
marital affairs. For one tryst,
he billed his hotel room for the
night to his campaign reelection
fund. Paterson, in his youth was
also a heavy user of marijuana
and tried cocaine “a few times.”

How do I know all this?
Sadly, it is not because I am
the second coming of the great
investigative
Woodward. No, I know all this
for a far simpler reason. One day
after his swearing in, Paterson
publicly acknowledged his inﬁ-
delity and a few days after, his
drug use.

I applaud Mr. Paterson for his
disclosure, yet I wonder: Should
he really have had to? The only
people he needs to reconcile his
past with are himself and his
family. It is not the business of

journalist Bob .

anyone else in the whole wide
world that Paterson has a past
like he does.

Just because Paterson is a
politician, it does not put him
under any obligation to publicly
come clean.

Before Jimmy the plumber
ﬁxes your leaky pipe, he doesn’t
give you full disclosure of his
past transgressions. Why? Be-
cause you don’t care. You just
want him to do his job well and
get out. So then why should you
care what a politician did if he
can do his job well in the pres-
ent?

Does it really matter that Pa-
terson slept with a woman not
his wife or smoked a few joints
or blew a few lines in his 20s?
The man is now 53 years old.
There is no reason why actions
committed 30 years ago should

be wielded as political weapons’

against Paterson as if they can
affect his ability to run a state
right now.

Let me be clear: I do not
condone his adultery or drug
use, but I am realistic enough
to know that plenty more for-
mer occupants of the govemor’s
mansion were no better than Pa-
terson, yet they ran New York
free from molestation. Why
should Paterson not get the same
treatment?

All actions have conse-
quences, and I am sure that
Paterson has suffered plenty in
his relationship with his fam-
ily, especially his wife, when he
was ﬁnally forced to confront

his actions. This is punishment,
enough; the man came out and
acknowledged his transgres-
sions in the past and asked for
forgiveness and cooperation in
the future as he works to make
New York a better state. Any
New Yorker who cannot forgive,
forget and agree to work with
Paterson now is a far greater
hindrance to the future success
of New York than anything Pat-
erson could have ever done.

I think now would be an ap-
propriate time for all of us to
turn the accusatory ﬁgure we
like to jab at public ﬁgures who
are caught doing wrong back on
ourselves. By way of example,
people love to roast Bill Clinton
for his actions with Monica Le-
winsky. But let’s think about this
seriously for second.

Did Clinton getting a little
somethin’ somethin’ on the side
really affect his ability to carry
out his duties as president?
Sure, he may have had sex with
Monica in the Oval Ofﬁce, but
did that affect his ability to sign
a good bill into law in that very
same room a few hours later?
The answer is no.

On the other hand, how about
a Washington and Lee student
who gets drunk on Saturday
night and wakes up on Sunday
morning to write a paper? The
nasty hangover he has the next
morning is going to make star-
ing at a computer screen for sev-
eral hours about as much fun as
a root canal without anesthesia.

Now think about it rationally.

Which of the two, Bill Clinton
or the student, has his current

action aﬁfected more by his past ,

behavior?

All I am trying to say is that .

we all have done things that we
regret and that have had conse-
quences. Most of us have had

our errors forgiven and are now ..

living our lives with the grace of
the forgiveness of others.
If people made a mistake in

the past, regretted their actions, 
made amends as best they could, '

and tried their utmost to live

their lives in the future in a way -

that shows they learned from

their mistakes, they deserve ev- ,

ery right to a second chance.

Paterson and every other C
public ﬁgure has just as much of .
a right to that second chance as =

you or me. That he is the gov-
ernor of New York makes no
difference; he still deserves the
chance to give his best shot at
doing his job. Despite popular

belief, politicians are people too, .

even the most debauched among
them.

So let’s all dismount from the
high horses that we so hypocriti-
cally ride and follow the (I can’t
believe I am about to write this,

but it’s true) sage advice of the _

Youngbloods when they sing,
“C’mon people now, smile on
your brother. Ev’rybody get to-
gether, try and love one another
right now.”

Why can the EC punish the papers?

Student government oversight kin to censorship; self-governance better option

As we start to ﬁnally put “The
Bracket,” behind us, last week’s
Media Board hearing about the
issue made one thing clear: it’s
time for the Executive Commit-
tee to remove itself from run-
ning the Media Board.

The editor of each campus
publication has a seat on the
Media Board, and the board has
the power to hear complaints
against publications and then,
if it chooses to, sanction those
publications.

In this case the board recom-
mended that there be no sanc-
tions.

Instead, we urged the Trident
— and all publications — to devel-
op a mission statement and code
of ethics. Incidentally, you can
read the Phi’s mission statement
in our staff box.

Despite the board’s deci-
sion, it wasn’t the ﬁnal word.
The EC met and voted whether

they wanted to accept the Media
Board recommendations.

This week, they did.

But it is unacceptable for an
institution of government — stu-
dent government in this case ~ to
have censorial control over the
press.

If the EC doesn’t like aggres-
sive coverage of its actions, can
the Phi or Trident expect to be
punished for their reporting?

Beyond the walls of Wash-
ington and Lee, the First Amend-
ment protects the press’s ability
to report on — and criticize ~ the
government.

In fact, the press has a duty to
be a watchdog over institutions
of power.

Journalists at W&L don’t en-
joy those same protections. Re-
moving the EC from the Media
Board process would go a long
way towards returning those
protections to students.

The best solution, in our
minds, would be the total demo-
lition of the Media Board. No
board would leave no room for
EC interference.

Sanctions are so rarely ap-
propriate or necessary that the
board really serves no purpose
(trust us, if you’ve been to ear-
lier Media Board meetings you
know what a snoozefest they
usually are).

Student publications, how-
ever, do use university oﬂice
space (the Phi and the Trident
included).

And some student publica-
tions receive money from the
EC during the annual appropria-
tions process (though the Phi
and Trident do not).

So unless the publications
are all willing to move out of
their Commons ofﬁce space, the
Media Board may have a role to
ﬁll.

Because of the money being
handed out, we understand the
EC’s desire to see some super-
vision.

That’s a role the Media Board
can ﬁll, serving as an advisor to
student publications and a place
where editors can come together
to share ideas and suggestions.

The EC, however, needs to
totally remove itself from any
disciplinary process adminis-
tered by the Media Board.

As long as the EC has the
power to’ hear complaints and
issue punishments, the student
press on this campus will be un-
able to cover the community in a
truly open and effective manner.

Outside the walls of campus,
the press can operate without
the government looking over its
shoulder.

The same should hold true
at a school that prides itself on
self-govemance.

‘ Concert to enlighten

A.C. T Guns and Dolls week Supports Uganda

By Michael Morella
STAFF WRITER

On any given night in Ugan-
da, -dozens of children could be
abducted and forced to serve as
soldiers in the nation’s continued
civil strife. For 20 years, as many
as 66,000 children have been in-
volved in the war and victims
of violent, sometimes inhuman,
crimes.

On Tuesday night in the Bak-
er-Davis-Gilliam Quad, dozens
of Washington and Lee students,
faculty and community members
will try and do something to stop
it.

W&L will host the ﬁrst ever
Guns and Dolls Concert, a free
event, to promote awareness of
the situation in Uganda. Three
student bands — Two Dirt Road,
Agent Flynn and the Lalai Damas
— will perform from 6 to 8 p.m.
to kick off Guns and Dolls Week,
which will raise money to aid‘
prevention of human rights viola-
tions against the children of war-
tom Uganda.

“[It’s] very hard for these kids
to go back home,” said sopho-
more Kushal Harjani, president of
A.C.T. (Action. Change. Tomor-
row), the student group sponsor-
ing the event. “[They] are often
forced to commit atrocities against
their own family members.”

According to Resolve Uganda,

' a Washington, D.C.-based orga-

nization dedicated to helping the
situation in central Africa, the
Lord’s Resistance Army continues
to ﬁght rival political and military
organizations and to terrorize the
Ugandan population.

The army was formed in the

1980s under the leadership of Jo-
seph Kony. Harjani said that over
80 percent of the LRA’s troops are
composed of children.

Many other children, called
“night commuters,” ﬂee their
homes to safe towns each night to
avoid abduction by the LRA.

Harjani says that proceeds
from the concert, as well as all
donations to A.C.T., will beneﬁt
both Resolve Uganda and World
Vision, a nonproﬁt organization
focused on aiding the plight of
children refugees.

“With a simple amount of $30,
we can sponsor a kid. . .and make
sure the child is safe for a month,”
Harjani said.

A.C.T. is one of W&L’s new-
est campus organizations with the
goal of spreading awareness of
global human rights issues. The
group also conducts fundraisers
to donate money to national and
international nonproﬁt organiza-
tions that work on these issues.

The response to Guns and
Dolls Week from university ofﬁ-
cials and organizations has been
encouraging, according to Har-
jani.

Eleven university organiza-
tions, including MSA, SAIL,
the General Activities Board,
the Oﬂice of Student Activities
and Greek Life, Nabors Service
League, Amnesty lntemational
and ﬁve fraternities are co-spon-
sors of the concert.

A.C.T. also sponsored W&L’s
observation of the international
initiative Burma Day in October
to promote awareness of the mili-
tary action against peaceful pro-
testers in Southeast Asia.

A.C.T. will be selling T-shirts

and holding a rafﬂe, in addition
to collecting donations, Monday
through Thursday. Guns and
Dolls Week will culminate Thurs-
day evening with the screening of
a documentary entitled “Invisible
Children,” created by three South-
ern California college students af-
ter a visit to Uganda in 2003.

“It’s something that I think
is obviously a big service to the
university,” said Professor Tyler
Dickovick, assistant professor of
politics at W&L. “It’s great that
we have organizations like this on
campus that are raising awareness
about areas of the world that we
don’t hear much about.”

Dickovick will introduce the
ﬁlm, which will be followed by
a question and answer session led
by Ugandan citizen and W&L ju-
nior Allan Kisoma.

“We just thought it’d be a
great opportunity to get people to
listen to our music and also sup-
port a really good cause,” said
sophomore Joel Poelhuis, bassist
for the band Agent Flynn.

“I just think that not a lot of
people know where Uganda is on
a map,” Poelhuis said. “I know I
don’t. This event will be great for
raising awareness.”

Harjani echoed Poelhuis’ sen-
timents, saying that he looks for-
ward to getting the W&L commu-
nity involved with future A.C.T.
events.

“We don’t only want to fund-
raise, we want people to realize
what the problem is,” Harjani said.
“We wanted to do something that
could make a difference.”

Fire on the stage

One acts provide some excitement, fun

By Celeste Cruz-Carandang
STA F F W R I TE R

The One Acts were, quite liter-
ally, a ﬂaming success.

From the full house to the suc-
cessfully-handled ﬁre incident
caused by yours truly, the three
nights of performances were el-
egantly and artfully produced.

However, the appreciative au-
dience only saw the fruit of our
labors. What went on behind the
scenes, despite the lack of pyro-
technics, grants audiences a new
perspective.

Due to the shortened nature of
the plays themselves, we did not
have to endure the arduous sched-
ules characteristic of the theater.

Furthermore, the casts were
much smaller, sometimes boast-
ing as few as two actors. Saman-
tha Copping, who played the char-
acter of Alice in Rothko Room,
commented that “One Acts was
such a completely different the-
ater experience for me.

It was so much more intimate.
With only one other actor, a di-
rector and a stage manager pres-
ent at rehearsal and then the audi-
ence only a few feet away during
shows, you can’t help but feel
more connected with the entire
process.”

Indeed, with the small John-‘

son Theater as their stage, we
were able to speak to an audience
much like our cast, small and in-
timate. Kimber Wiggs, who acted
in the part of Mrs. Ballone in the
pithily titled play Mosquito, Diri-
gible, Aerosol Deodorant, echoed
Copping’s sentiments. As a new-
comer to the theater scene, Wiggs
felt that One Acts was a perfect

way to transition into the depart-
ment. “This was my ﬁrst experi-
ence with the theater department,
and I loved it, “ said Wiggs. “One
Acts were so much fun and laid
back that I didn’t mind the hours
and hours of practice. Plus, hav-
ing such a small cast meant we all
go to bond really quickly. It was
so much fun, and I loved getting
positive feedback from everyone
who came.”

Although we were able to note
the unique nature of the brief
plays, the One Acts present an-
other distinguishing feature to
the Washington and Lee com_-

kind of support can make amaz-
ing things happen.”

During all the performances,
it was evident that the combined
efforts of the directors, actors
and crew truly did make amazing
things happen. Opening night was
met with laughter and applause
while Friday night’s performance
yielded a packed house. Students
came to see their peers perform
on the Johnson Stage in droves on
that second night of performanc-
es. In addition to the full house,
friends and family were sitting in
the aisles and in any extra space
to be found.

“I knew that if I needed an opinon, an extra set

of hands, or even a shoulder to lean on, I had

four people therefor me. ’

munity. That is to say, the plays
were all student directed by the
majors of the department. The
student directors included Lauren
Sapikowski, Gabrielle de’Courcy,
Helen Coupe, Tabitha King and
Lisa Reppell.

Although their respective
works differed greatly in content,
the directors were bonded under
the banner of their artistic en-
deavors. Sapikowski, the director
of Rothko Room, said, “I think
that this year was a really strong
year for the One Acts in part be-
casue the directors worked well
together. I knew that if I needed
an opinon, an extra set of hands,
or even a shoulder to lean on, I
had four people there for me. That

They also endured an un-
planned yet hilarious accident in
the shape of a ﬂaming garbage
can. It seems that I, as Ms. Netty
of Mosquito, became a bit too
lighter friendly. I also did not pre-
dict that the garbage can, which
is usually free of all ﬂammable
objects, was packed with paper.
However, the stunt, for lack of
a better word, was greeted with
overwhelming ovation and laugh-
ter. Saturday night proved to be a
much safer success. Despite the
lack of Backdraft-esque special
effects, the audience was still in-
credibly receptive the humors and
emotions of each performance.

What a Win!

Women beat No. 3 Middlebury

By Russ Weems
smrr wmren

The eighth-ranked Generals played two games
this week against the third-ranked Middlebury Pan-
thers and the Catholic University Cardinals. The
Generals came into the week 8-1, winners of their
last four.

The Generals ‘started the week off against Mid-
dlebury. The Generals have only taken on one team
ranked as high as Middlebury and lost 4-7. When
the game began, the Panthers jumped out to a quick
lead, scoring the first two goals. W&L was not
fazed, however, and tied the score at 2-2. The game
stayed close for the rest of the ﬁrst half, with the
Generals scoring the last two goals to go in half with
a 4-3 lead.

After half, W&L came out strong. They domi-
nated the beginning of the second half, scoring the
ﬁrst four goals to take an 8-3 lead. This run, capped
off by Kat Michaels, put the Generals out of reach
for the Panthers. Even though the Panthers scored
three of the next four goals, they could come no
closer than three. The Generals had completed the
upset, 14-8.

This upset was led by some key individual per-
forrnances. The Generals were paced by senior at-
tacker Christine Bender’s career-high ﬁve goals.
Sophomore attacker Britten Mathews tallied three
goals and two assists, while junior midﬁelder Col-
leen Evans addedanother three goals. Junior attack-
er Kelsi Robinson contributed one goal and dished
out two assists. Senior Sarah Tilbor made 13 saves
in goal for W&L.

After their bring win to start off the week, the
Generals took on the Catholic University Cardinals.
The Generals started off quickly, taking the lead a
mere 10 seconds into the game when midﬁelder Col-
leen Evans scored off an assist from Kelsi Robinson.
However, Catholic responded quickly by scoring
with 25:04 left in the half. The ﬁrst half was closely
contested and featured three ties. When Catholic
tied it up with 3:33 to go, the Generals responded
with back-to-back goals from Christine Bender go-
ing into the half. At the break, the Generals led by
two, 7-5.

The second half started like the ﬁrst with the Gen-
erals getting a quick goal and the Cardinals respond-
ing with a goal of their own. This brought the score
to 8-6. The Generals then went on a run, scoring the
next three goals. Catholic again responded, scoring
3 of the next 4 to bring the score to 12-9. At this
point, W&L made a run that would put the Cardinals
away and decide the contest. The Generals scored
the next 4 goals capped off by a free position shot
by Katie Flippen with 8:47 left. Catholic scored a
couple of goals with a few minutes to go, but it was
too little too late. The game was capped off by a
goal with one second left from Megan Slosson, giv-
ing W&L a 17-11 victory.

The Generals had some strong individual perfor-
mances in the victory. They were led by junior at-
tacker Kelsi Robinson who scored 3 goals and added
5 assists in the win. Sophomore attacker Britten
Matthews scored a game high 4 goals. Colleen Ev-
ans, Christine Bender, and Megan Slosson also had
multiple goals. Senior. Sarah Tilbor played the entire
game in goal and recorded 10 saves.

W&L returns to action on Sunday when it travels
to Randolph-Macon for a 3 p.m. ODAC contest.

Doornbos sets top D-III mark

Billington and Sutherland set new marks in hammer throw and I 00 meter hurdles

By Kevln corn
STAFF WRITER

The track team spent the week-
end at Liberty University breaking
records and qualifying for the NCAA
tournament.

While at the two day, Asics Lib-
erty Invitational, junior Stacy Door-
nbos, sophomore Maggie Sutherland,
and sophomore Sallie Armstrong
completed the Heptathlon. Armstrong
took eighth, right behind sophomore.
Maggie Sutherland. Doornbos ﬁn-
ished third, only behind two competi-
tors from North Carolina. Doornbos’
score of 4,562 was the top score of
DIII competitors at the meet, as well
as a new school record, and astound-
ingly the top score now in the nation
for DIII. Needless to say, Doombos
easily qualiﬁed for NCAAS.

' “I was really excited about how
the meet went,” commented Door-
nbos. “Maggie Sutherland, Sallie
Armstrong and I all competed in the
Helptathlon (100 hurdles, high jump,

shot put, 200m, long jump, javalin,
and 800m) and were all able to im-

- prove our scores by a lot from what

we were scoring last year.” She con-
tinued, “it is really encouraging to see
that all the work we have been doing
in the various events is paying off. I
was also really excited because I was
able to qualify for nationals in the
Hep again this year.”

Junior Alysen Kuck also showed a
strong showing in the javelin and high
jump where she notched ﬁrst place in

both events by throwing 115’1” and .

jumping 1.53 meters. Meanwhile,
sophomore Dorothy Todd was a top
DIII ﬁnisher in the 1,500 meter run
after crossing the ﬁnish line in a time
of 5:01.48. Junior Elizabeth Webb
also had a great run in the 5000 after
ﬁnishing in a time of 17:55. Close be-
hind her was sophomore Kat Telfey-

. an who notched second among DIII

competitors in the same event with a
time of 18:31.

Webb described the emotions of
her run on Saturday. “I was extremely

pleased with my performance. I have
been trying to break 18 minutes in the
5k all season and I knew that this was
the meet where I needed to do it.”

Moreover, Webb expressed the
difﬁculty of the race: “The race was
one of the hardest I’ve ever run in my
life. I led wire to wire, so I was es-
sentially by myself, running into the
wind. But my teammates, coaches
and family kept me motivated for the
full 12 and half laps. I could not have
done it without them.”

The men also had a strong week-
end as junior Michael Welsh captured
ﬁrst place in the 5000 meter run with
a time of 15:47.62. Meanwhile, ju-
nior Vance Berry ﬁnished third in
the 1500 meter run with a time of
4:l2.52.Sophomore Ben Goetsch
was able to clear a height of 6’5” in
the high jump ~ good enough for a
ﬁrst place ﬁnish.

“I was very happy with my per-
formance,” commented Goetsch. He
shared: “6’5” was a personal best for
me and I got the opportunity to com-

pete with some very good division
one jumpers (including W&L assis-
tant coach Garrett Brickner, who also
jumped 6’5”).”

Junior Chip McCoy took ﬁfth in
the 400 meter hurdles after crossing
the ﬁnish line in a time of 4:12.52.
Then, sophomore Billy Billington
had an exceptional weekend after ﬁn-

ishing second in the discus throw with

a distance of l37’1” and then taking
third in the hammer throw while set-
ting a new school record of 143’11’.’.

Billington was all business when
asked about his performance. “I was
satisﬁed with my throws, but I know
I have a lot to improve on before
ODACs” he, said. “This weekend
gave me a good idea on where I stand
compared to other throwers in the
conference.”

The Generals will be back in ac-
tion at the beginning of Spring Break
when they travel to Lynchburg to
compete in the Lynchburg Track
Classic

Homestand not so sweet for baseball

Team goes I -3 durirzgfour-game homestand, drops to 7-6 in conference play

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington & Lee Men’s
Baseball team went 1-3 in the four-
game home stand this week.

The Generals came off of a tough
ﬁve-game road trip in which the team
ﬁnished 3-2, before coming back
home for four consecutive games.

W&L faced Bridgewater College
on Tuesday. The Eagles cracked the
scoreboard ﬁrst in the top of the ﬁrst
inning and added another run in the
second. The score was 2-0.

The Generals started off cold in
the contest, failing to score in the ﬁrst
three innings and only amassing one
hit. However, the Blue and White
broke out of the slump in the bottom
of the fourth. Senior captain James

Madden doubled to right ﬁeld and he .

eventually came around to score on a
Bridgewater error, making the score
2-1.

After the Eagles scored in the
ﬁrst two innings, they were unable to
score in the next three, but W&L con-
tinued to struggle offensively.

In the sixth inning, BC scored an-
other run on a string of singles and a
hit batsman. The Generals responded
in the second half of the inning with
two runs to tie the game at 3-3. Mad-
den led of the inning with another
double, Will Lewis singled and drove
in Madden, then Hunter Serenbetz
singled, and Tim Livingston drove in
Lewis to knot the game.

The tie game was short lived as
Bridgewater blew the game open in
the eighth inning with four runs on

four hits and an error. They added an
insurance run in the ninth, but W&L
could not answer and the game ended
9-3.

The next day, the Generals stepped
out of conference to play Southern
Virginia University.

This time, the Blue and White
opened up the scoring. W&L com-
piled ﬁve hits en route to a three run
ﬁrst inning, highlighted by a lead-
off triple to deep center by Terrence
McKelvey. The Knights answered in
the second with their ﬁrst run of the
game making the score 3-1.

The Generals followed the three
run inning in the ﬁrst with a ﬁve run
inning in the second. With the bases
loaded, sophomore Jim Plantholt
launched a shot that cleared the left-
ﬁeld fence for a grand slam.

“I was just looking for a good
pitch to drive,” said Plantholt. “In my
ﬁrst at bat, I was a little out in front of
the ball so I was trying to stay back
and hit it hard. The pitcher threw me
a fast ball and I put a good swing on
the ball.”

W&L had a commanding 8-1 lead
through two innings.

The Generals continued their hot
streak in the third inning by add-
ing two more runs on back-to-back
doubles by Dan Harris and Anthony
Cardona.

The Blue and White subsequently
exploded in the fourth inning. The
team scored a staggering nine runs,
while batting through the lineup. The
inning was capped off with another
homerun to leftﬁeld by Plantholt.

“Before my second homerun, I
was looking for the pitcher to throw
mostly curveballs, but instead he
gave me a fast ball and again I just
wanted to put a good swing on the
ball,” said Plantholt. “I was seeing
the ball reallyjwell and was able to
pick up his pitches early - just look-
ing to hit a good pitch.”

The score was 19-1 and the game
was out of reach though it ended with
a 19-8 win by the Generals.

In the contest, Plantholt batted 3 A

for 6 with two homeruns and seven
RBIs. The two homeruns tie the
W&L record for homeruns in a game
and the seven RBIs tie the second
best RBI performance in a game.

“I’ve never been a power hit-
ter, just always looking to hit a line
drive,” said Plantholt after the record-
tying game. “It’s pretty awesome
having that [homerun] record. Now
until someone beats it, I’ll have my
name up there on the website which
is pretty cool.”

The Generals stepped back in con-
ference on Saturday to play a double-
header against Guilford College.

The game was scoreless through
the ﬁrst three and a half innings.
Neither team was able to capitalize
on their opportunities. In the bottom
of the fourth, W&L ﬁnally took ad-
vantage. Serenbetz led off the inning
with a single, followed by a single
from Plantholt, Livingston moved the
runners over to third and second base,
and Byron Peyster hit a sacriﬁce ﬂy
to centerﬁeld that drove in Serenbetz
to give the Generals the 1-0 lead.

Guilford answered in the sixth inning
with a lead off homerun to center to
deadlock the game at 1-1.

Both teams broke out in the sev-
enth inning. Guildford started out
with three runs on two hits and an er-
ror, giving them the 4-1 lead. W&L
countered with two runs on three
hits in the bottom half, but it wasn’t
enough in the shortened game be-
cause of the doubleheader. The ﬁnal
score was 4-3. ~

Guilford and W&L continued
their hot streak from the seventh in-
ning to the start of the second game
of the day.

The Quakers had a fast start
right from the gate, scoring ﬁve runs
in the top of the ﬁrst on four hits and
two costly errors. This put the Gener-
als in a quick 5-0 hole. W&L chipped
away at the lead in the bottom of the
ﬁrst, narrowing the score to 5-2.

Guilford added another run in the
third. In the fourth, Serenbetz added
in some heroics with a solo homerun
to right-centerﬁeld. The score was
6-3. W&L continued to crawl back
in the next inning by adding another
run. However, the Quakers widened
the margin in the sixth with two runs,
pushing the score out to 8-4.

The Generals rallied in the sev-
enth on three singles by Peyster,
McKelvey, John Ditore and a double
by Madden. The score was cut to 8-6,
but that was as close as it would get
as neither team scored the rest of the
way.

The W&L Baseball team is now
16-8 overall and 7-6 in conference.

G Fab Five competition no match for Women’s tennis

The Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team remained

singles and doubles against Gus-
tavus Adolphus.

Seniors Katie Duncan, Rhodes
Proctor, and Lauren Cook as well
as sophomores Blair Brzeski, Ka-

recorded two wins against Guil-
ford as the Generals only dropped
three games the entire match.

On Thursday, third-ranked
Williams provided the stiffest
competition of the season for
the Generals. All three doubles
matches were tight. In No. 1
doubles, Tabb and Caire pulled
out an 8-6 victory over Alllison
Rottkamp and Grace Baljon. In

No. 2 doubles, Weston and fresh-
man Catherine Reed dropped the
tiebreak to lose 9-8 (7-5) to Cary
Gibson and Annie Schniedman,
but Will and freshman Virginia
Dickinson pulled out an 8-5 vic-
tory at No. 3 doubles to give the
Generals a 2-1 lead heading into
the singles competition.

Gibson and Baljon won ﬁrst
and second singles for the Ephs

nated the top of the doubles and
singles competitions, teaming up

day for the Generals.

With the win, the Generals im-
proved to 18-0. The women will

16th. .

Sweet sets 50 freestyle record at NCAA championship

Team places eighth, tying highest ﬁnish ever, six swimmers win ﬁrst team All-American accolades

By Mlchael Keenan

0 SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee
men’s swimming team equaled its
highest ever ﬁnish of eighth place
and had its ﬁrst national cham-
pion since 1995 at the NCAA
Division III championships from
March 20-22.

On day one, senior Alex Sweet
broke twenty seconds for the ﬁrst
time by swimming 19.99 in the 50
freestyle prelims, edging out rival
Brad Test of Johns Hrmkins hv

0.04 seconds going into the ﬁnal
in the evening. Senior Tim Mc-
Glaston also made the champion-
ship heat in the event, swimming
a 20.58, the seventh best prelim
time. In the ﬁnals, Sweet dropped
his time by 0.14 seconds to 19.85,
the fastest ever in the Division
III NCAA championships. Mc-
Glaston also improved by swim-
ming 20.51, good enough for sev-
enth place. Sweet is W&L’s ﬁrst
swimming national champion
since Nathan Hottle won the 200

breast in 1995.

Also on day one was the 200
free relay. McGlaston and Sweet
teamed with junior Brett Tatman
and sophomore Brandon Bamds
to set a school record of 1:21.55
in the prelims. In the ﬁnals, Mc-
Glaston led off with a 20.48 to put
the Generals into third at the ﬁrst
exchange. However, the Generals
had fallen into last when Sweet
started his anchor leg. Sweet’s
split of 19.12 was fast enough to
catch four other teams and move

the Generals into fourth place.

On day two, Sweet led the way
with a ninth place ﬁnish in the
200 free in a school-record time
ofll 239.10. Junior Paul Crook ﬁn-
ished 11th in the same event in a
time of 1:40.82.

In "the nightcap, Sweet and
Crook teamed with McGlaston
and junior Chris Diebold to place
eighth in the 800 free relay. Swim-
ming the anchor leg, Sweet played
the hero again, making up a two
second deﬁcit to pass Emory and

ﬁnish in a time of 6:45.44.

Sweet completed his incred-
ible championship swims on day
three with a fourth place ﬁnish in
the 100 free.

Sweet ﬁnished the prelim in
44.51 to set a new school record
and then came back in the evening
with a time of 44.83, out-touching
Johns Hopkins’ Brad Test by six
hundredths of a second for fourth
place. McGlaston also competed
in the event, ﬁnishing 15th in a
time of 45.96.

The Generals concluded their
championship with a sixth place
ﬁnish in the 400 free relay. Sweet,
McGlaston, Crook, and Barnds
improved their preliminary time
by over a second and a half to
set a school record in a time of
3:02.53, two tenths of a second
ahead of New York University.

The ﬁnal relay was enough
to move W&L ahead of NYU to
ﬁnish alone in eighth place, tying
their highest ﬁnish ever.

Rugby loses elite eight
heartbreaker 13-9

The club rugby went on an unprecedented run
this spring, falling just a few yards short of the
rugby ﬁnal four in a 13-9 loss Sunday to Wid-
ener. Captain Sean McKinley said he and other
veterans never expected the team to go so deep
in the tournament, but he said the team caught
ﬁre behind the golden leg of Josh Prell, who went
4 of 5 on kicks in the ‘Sweet Sixteed, scoring 12
points and helping W&L pull out a 17-15 vic-
tory.

Prell provided all nine points in Sunday’s
loss, but the team was ultimately done in by its

son. See the full story on page 9.
