,. Greek leaders develop Vision council

Alcohol abuse, risky behavior on Tear Night spark ideas to improve student health

By Jacob Gelger
MANAGING sonoa

Two weeks after Greek rush
week resulted in disciplinary
sanctions against multiple fra-
ternities, and a full health center
on Tear Night, Greek leaders are
launching a new plan to address
problems in the fraternity system.

Incoming Inter-fratemity

‘ Council President and current Ju-

nior Justice Alex Duckworth said
work began on the document the
Monday and Tuesday after Tear
Night.

“We want this to be something
students think is a good idea,”
Duckworth said.

According to Director of Cam-
pus Activities Jason Rodocker, the
document will act as a constantly
evolving barometer of Washing-
ton and Lee’s Greek system.

The current version describes
a Greek system struggling with
alcohol abuse, harassment of
Traveller drivers, hazing prob-
lems, women seeking the morn-
ing after pill after unprotected
sex and sexual assault rates that
continue to exceed the national
collegiate average.

“Basically, Tear Night was
the catalyst” for the document,
Rodocker said.

Both Rodocker and Duckworth
said problems with the fraternity
rush began before the Tear Night
parties resulted in students being
admitted to the health center and

democracy” originally conceived
by the founders~—a democracy
with the franchise limited to a
landowning class.

He praised the Democratic
ﬁeld’s diversity and willingness
to vigorously debate the best di-
rection course for the nation while
condemning the “mutlichrome
debatelessness” of the Republi-
can candidates.

Touching brieﬂy on policy
recommendations, Jackson drew
applause from the predominantly
college-age crowd for his call to
increase Pell grants in order to
ease the ﬁnancial burdens on stu-
dents.

“Too few in college, too many
in jail,” he said.

Jackson also called for invest-
ment in infrastructure such as
roads, bridges, and schools, and
called for strong action to “put
American back to work” and to
address what he called the “sub—
prime crisis” in the housing mar-
ket.

He closed by admonishing
a government that he believes
leaves “poor people exposed” and
“ﬁghts terror with terror.”

“I dream of the day when we
will honor the promise of fairness
 of equality,” he said, “It’s time

“It was kind of shocking to
see some things we seemed to

be making progress on go back-‘

wards,” Rodocker said.

According to philosophy pro-
fessor Melina Bell, who serves on
the Student Affairs Committee,
these types of incidents give fac-
ulty a negative view of the Greek
system.

“Students can learn real leader-
ship and address problems in the
community [through the Greek
system],” Bell said.

“Faculty members who were
Greek see it as a social organiza-
tion but also as other things like
a chance to learn leadership and
service.”

Bell said the faculty doesn’t
mind the fact that students drink.
What does concern them, she
said, is how prevalent alcohol ap-
pears to be at W&L.

“There is concern for stu-
dent health, and it draws energy
away from learning,” Bell said.
“People are more tired; alcohol
impairs memory and takes time
away from studying and events
that could broaden horizons.”

A weekend of problems

For the IFC, problems began
the Thursday night of rush week,
a night more commonly known as
bid night. IFC ofﬁcers regularly
noticed that members at both Pi
Kappa Phi and Kappa Alpha were
serving alcohol to freshmen, a di-
rect violation of rules that prohibit

for achange.” _ .

address, Jackson elaborated on
his policy vision. He called for
a new national vision along the
lines of the New Deal to address
the ailing economy at home and
a policy of engagement with Iran
and Syria abroad.

“We need a foreign policy not
foreign to our values,” he said.

When asked about the legacy
young people should receive,
Jackson expressed his hope that
he could pass down to his grand-
child “a sense that she matters,
a sense of religion, a sustaining
force.”

He also touched ‘brieﬂy on
his own upbringing, stressing
in particular the importance of
hard work and temperance; he
explained that he does not drink
to this day because he saw as a
young man too many hard—work-
ing friends “get drunk and lose all
self-respect on the weekends.”

While Jackson did not wish to
sway student opinion one way or
another, he was not shy about de-
claring his own allegiance: “I’m
voting for Barack,” he said.

‘Most serious election of my
lifetime’

Earlier Friday, delegates heard
remarks from former congress-
woman Geraldine Ferraro. Fer-
raro, the first woman nominated

alcohol from being served during
formal rush.

The IFC handed the two fra-
ternities social probation for two
weeks, a $5 per member ﬁne and
conduct probation, which means
that if the fraternities violate rush
rules next year, they’ll face a dis-
ciplinary strike from the IFC.

Current IFC President Chris
Womom said the problems at
the two houses were conﬁned to
just a few members and weren’t
house-wide.

Things only got worse Friday,
a supposed no-contact night that
was designed to give freshmen
time to think about which house
they want to join.

But IFC discovered that most
fraternities had set up parties Fri-
day night where freshmen could
go to an empty house and help
themselves to copious amounts of
beer and liquor.

No upperclassmen were pres-
ent at most houses, so no-Contact
rules were not technically vio-
lated. But according to Rodocker
and Duckworth, the events clearly
abused the spirit of the no-contact
rules. _

, Since so many houses were
caught, the council decided to
forgo disciplinary measures and
instead focus on writing new rules
that will prevent the recurrence of
these parties next year.

“Rules like this come about
because people exploit loopholes
in the principles” of rush week,
Rodocker said. i

Senator Hillary Clinton’s presi-
dential campaign.

In addition to Clinton’s record
and policy stances, Ferraro was a
particular fan of another one of
her qualiﬁcations: “I really like
the fact that she’s a woman,” she
said.

Declaring that the nation is

5 -ready for a woman chief execu-

tive, Ferraro went on to say that,
had Walter “Fritz” Mondale won
the 1984 election, she would have
been elected in 1992 and “the
whole issue would’ve been de-
cided.” -
She remarked on how much
has changed in recent times—de-
claring that, for the ﬁrst time
in United States history, “being

white and male is a disadvantage” I

in a presidential campaign.

Ferraro spoke hopefully about
the role of youth in the political
process, declaring that young
people possess a “baloney-meter”
that can detect the authenticity of
the candidates.

She expanded upon this theme
in a press conference following
her speech, praising the student
body for its political awareness;
she suggested the voter turnout
of W&L students in the coming
election would almost certainly be
ahead of the nation as a whole.

But problems in the Greek
system aren’t just conﬁned to fra-
ternities.

As the ﬁrst draft of the Greek
vision said, “Sorority women
show up at fraternity parties hav-
ing already gotten drunk beyond
the point of good decision mak-
ing.”

Jackie DiBiasie, the incoming
Panhellenic president, said the
sororities would be working hard
to address the issues in the docu-
ment.

“We recognize it is an equal
problem on the guys and girls
sides,” DiBiasie said.

A full health center

Dr. Jane Horton, director of
student health, said this year’s
Tear Night was the busiest in
about 10 years.

“We were busier here than all
fall,” Horton said. “People were
celebrating in high-risk ways.”

And though every bed and
couch in the health center was
full with a mix of students suffer-
ing from regular illnesses or from
alcohol problems, Horton said
the staff managed to handle the
crunch of students without having
to call in extra staff.

According to Duckworth, the
IFC president, some students were
sent to the hospital with blood al-
cohol levels that approached or
exceeded .30 percent. The legal
driving limit for 21-year-olds in
Virginia is .08 percent.

Horton also said that use of

 She also.,discussed upon the _
‘state of the campaign leading up

to what she called in her speech
“the most important election of
my lifetime.” She declared that
women “are never allowed to
cry in politics” while disput-
ing the claim that Sen. Clinton’s
eleventh-hour show of emotion
helped her achieve victory in a
close New Hampshire primary.

Regardless of who wins the
primary, she expressed conﬁ-
dence that Democrats will “come
together at the convention.”

She also expressed her ap-
preciation for fellow speaker and
former colleague Charlie Wilson:
“He’s better looking than Tom
Hanks,” she said of the former
Congressman.

‘What the hell?’

Former senator Max Cleland
delivered a rousing speech to the
convention that was part polemic
and part comedy.

He opened by quoting Benja-
min Franklin’s famous line that
he had given the people “a repub-
lic  if [they could] keep it” and
praised the student body’s partici-
pation as a ﬁne example of such
“keeping.”

However, he qualiﬁed his
statement by remarking that, if
Franklin were to walk into the
gym that day, he would probably
exclaim “What the hell?”

emergency contraceptives, or
Plan B, by female students was
more prevalent after Tear Night.

“We always see a Plan B blip
on big weekends like Orienta-
tion, Homecoming and Christmas
Weekend,” Horton said. “The
number of prescriptions we gave
out [after Tear Night] was in line
with those levels.”

Horton said the she sees a
direct correlation between high-
risk alcohol use and the number
of Plan B doses requested by
students. W&L still administers
Plan B as a prescription, but stu-
dents can receive the dose from a
nurse and do not have to see one
of the center’s two doctors.

DiBiasie said the sororities
would continue to educate their
members about the link between
drinking and unprotected sex.

She said sorority women also
continue to be distressed by the
high level of sexual assaults.

“Alcohol is linked to that, so
hopefully after alcohol use goes
down, assaults will go down
too.” ‘

Bell said the faculty members
often wonder why W&L students
seem to spend so little time inter-
acting with members of the oppo-
site sex.

sues. ~

“We are in as grave a situation
since World War II,” he declared,
launching into a lengthy discourse
against war in general and the Iraq
war in particular.

“War has become a part of the
institutional fabric of our country,
and that’s not the way it’s sup-
posed to be,” he said, adding that
it is “immoral” to keep American
troops in Iraq. The president and
secretary of defense, he said after-

into hell [by sending] these kids

ministration is bankrupt.”

“This school needs and is
ready for change, but drastic
change won’t work,” Duckworth
said. '

He said that constant evolu-
tion will help fraternities move
forward. i

“The fraternity I joined fresh-
man year and the one I’m in now
are not the same chapter, in a good
way,” Duckworth said.

To get more chapter members
involved, a Greek vision council
is being formed to continually re-
view and discuss the document.

Womom said that fraternity
members don’t necessarily have
to help develop the vision, but he
said members realize that change
is coming to the system.

“They do need to understand
why it’s important,” Womom
said. “If we achieve that a lot of
things will fall into place.”

Bell said she also sees the sep-
aration between student leaders
and chapter members.

“I see a big disconnect be-
tween what leaders do and want
to do and student expectations.”

Bell said that the faculty wants
to see the Greek system improve
and has been impressed with the
response of student leaders in the
Greek system.

“They have the right attitude
and potential to make changes,”
Bell said.

“The most pressing concern
is how much students drink and
how often.”

Three panhellenic sororities Vie for single spot at W&L

Sorority women will vote for sixth chapter to join campus next fall, changes in recruitment will beneﬁt newcomer

By Jacob Gelger
MANAGING EDITOR

After years of work, Wash-
ington and Lee University is just
weeks away from ﬁnalizing plans
to bring a sixth Panhellenic soror-
ity to campus.

After Panhellenic Council
reviewed applications from 11
sororities, three — Phi Mu, Alpha
Delta Pi and Delta Delta Delta
— were selected as ﬁnalists.

Each of the ﬁve existing soror-
ities will rank the candidates from
1-3, and the sorority with the
highest score will become W&L’s
newest chapter.

“With fraternities, you have 14
options, whereas girls only have
ﬁve,” said Lauren Ottaway, who

led Panhellenic’s extension — or
sorority recruitment — efforts.

The new chapter will colonize
on campus next winter during
formal recruitment. Though the
chapter will not have a house next
year, the university has agreed to
build a sixth sorority house that
will open no later than fall 2011.
The house will be located next to
the Kappa Kappa Gamma house.

A 2005 attempt to add a new
sorority collapsed because the
school and national sorority could
not reach an agreement over how
— and when — a new house would
be built.

Ottaway [said she and other
sorority women looked closely at
the candidates to make sure they

understood W&L’s culture.

“You can deﬁnitely tell who
had been to campus and looked
things up,” she said.

Senior Jess Cobb, who just
ﬁnished a term as president of Pi
Beta Phi, said Panhellenic also
looked for a sorority that would
complement the current houses.

“We looked for different types
of programming, different philan-
thropy,” Cobb said.

Dana Smith, the assistant di-
rector of student activities and
Greek life, said the main purpose
of adding a new chapter was to re-
duce the size of sororities.

“Students come to W&L for
a small, close—knit community,”
Smith said, “and they want that in

student life as well as in the class-
room.”

The current chapters started
the year with between 73-100
members and then added 35-40
new members during rush.

Once the new sorority reaches
full capacity, each chapter would
hopefully have an average size of
70 and then add 20-25 new mem-
bers each winter.

To help the new sorority reach
capacity, it will be able to offer 70
bids next winter while other so-

‘rorities will only be able to extend

about 25. That number will not
officially be set until next fall.
Recruitment efforts will be led
by national ofﬁcers from the so-
rority and women from chapters

at nearby schools. Smith said this
practice is common when new
sororities colonize at a school.
Members of W&L’s Kappa Alpha
Theta chapter helped a new chap-
ter at James Madison University
get off the ground in the fall.

The _three ﬁnalists will be on
campus this week for presenta-
tions that will be open to the pub-
lic. Alpha Delta Pi will be here
on Jan. 31, followed by Delta
Delta Delta on Feb. 5 and Phi
Mu on Feb. 7. All presentations
will start at 7:30 p.m. in the Elrod
Commons’ theater, with smaller
discussions scheduled to take
place after each presentation in a
room upstairs.

To vote, women must attend

all three presentations.

And though the new chapter
won’t have a house for girls to
live in, Ottaway said there will be
other selling points for the new
sorority.

“A major selling point is to
be a founding member and see a
sorority come into fruition,” Ot-
taway said. “It also lets sopho-
mores and juniors come in and
take strong leadership roles right
away.”

Jackie ‘DiBiasie, the incom-
ing Panhellenic president, agreed
with Ottaway.

”“You have no house, but you
have the opportunity to create a
new sorority,” DiBiase said. “lt’s
a chance to set precedent.”

We may have chosen Clinton, but youth not guaranteed to vote come November

At 8:00 Friday night, Mock
Convention ﬁnally made
sense. ' '

It was truly moving to look
out across a packed house of
students in ties, dresses and
those funny little hats as for-
mer Sen. Max Cleland and
Rev. Jesse Jackson captivated
the crowd.

Years of planning, recruit-
ing speakers, signing up dele-
gates and a bitterly cold parade
ﬁnally paid off.

Many of us probably didn’t
agree with parts of Jackson’s
speech. Alter all, he focused
on race in a year when the can-
didate he supports — Barack
Obama — is talking about mov-
ing beyond race and looking
into the 21st century for a new,
bi-racial coalition.

In a way, Jackson’s speech
was a perfect example of the
divide that separates Obama
and our generation from people
like the Clintons and Jackson.

Regardless of each dele-
gate’s politics, it was exciting
to see a campus.

We may have enjoyed hear-
ing people like Gov. Tim Kaine
and Sen. Jim Webb, but this
convention really belonged
to Del. Attorney Gen. Beau
Biden, Texas Rep. Patrick Rose
and former Rep. Harold Ford,
Jr. Those three men are the
next generation of leaders, and
it was clear from the reception
they received that students are
excited about the future these
men represent.

Mock Convention prob-
ably describes our school and

culture better than any other
event.

The hard work across the
board was obvious. Incredible
ﬂoats (did you see the Arkan-
sas and Georgia delegations?)
mixed with — we hope — incred-
ible political savvy.

And because we’re W&L,
we took time out to laugh at
ourselves and make sure the
Texans on campus remembered
that they’re just another state,
not their own nation. And, in
case you forgot, Colorado is
the highest state in the nation.

It may be weeks before we
know who wins the Democrat-
ic nod, but this much is clear:
despite the overwhelming sig-
nal that more students support
Obama than Clinton, each del-
egation voted with its head in-

stead of its heart.

Though Cllinton won yes-
terday’s vote, our convention
should serve as a warning to
her. Young voters — both on
this campus and across the na-
tion — are a huge wild card for
the primaries and the general
election.

If Obama can emerge with
the nomination, these Voters
might be the block that guar-
antees a victory against his
Republican opponent (assum-
ing, of course, that the GOP is
eventually able to pick a can-
didate).

Will these young voters turn
out for Clinton in November?
Or will they stay home and
decide that their parents and
grandparents ‘are too dumb to
pay attention to the youth?

When asked, most of the
speakers seemed conﬁdent that
W&L students will vote in No-
vember regardless of who the
parties nominate. They’re tak-
ing the student vote for granted,
convinced that this important
election will have high turnout
regardless of the candidates.

This idea is foolish and
naive. Students won’t vote in
November unless they think
one of the candidates will lis-
ten to the younger generation‘
and move beyond the pointless
bickering that has left so many
young Americans fed up with
politics.

We may have picked Clin-
ton, but unless she changes
her tune, she shouldn’t expect
many of our votes in Novem-
ber.

Mock Con continues time-honored traditions

Strong, promising Democratic leaders who speak on relevant issues a privilege to listen to

By Jess Stelnmetz
COLUMNIST

Unlike many seniors, I only
had the small role as a delegate
in Mock Convention. While I
did not take advantage of the
opportunity to become further
involved, I still believe it was
a more rewarding experience
than it would have been if I
were a freshman.

Since I moved to Lexing-
ton, the classes I have taken
and my experiences have
made this weekend even more
meaningful. Without Professor
Beckley’s poverty class, the
speakers who focused on pov-
erty would have not had such
a profound impact. Similarly,
without Professor’s Mitchell’s
class on election media cover-
age, I would have barely known
Harold Ford’s name.

Knowing the details of his
political history allowed me to
further appreciate his inspiring
words.

I had little connection with
Virginia freshman year and still
found it diﬂicult to even imag-

ine that I lived in the South of
all places. Now I actually say I
live in Virginia without think-
ing twice, which made hearing
Virginia Governor Kaine, Vir-
ginia Senator Webb, andRich-
mond Mayor Wilder even more
consequential.

As a senior, my perspective
on voting is far different than
it was as a college freshman.
I will soon be graduating and
leaving “college life” behind
me. As a freshman, my focus
was on the nextlfour years of
my life, which is certainly not
the case now.

When voting for president,
it is crucial to look at more than
just the next four years. Politi-
cal issues now have an impact
on my life as a working indi-
vidual rather than a student.
I believe most freshmen are
looking at politics as a student
where seniors are starting to
view it differently.

Thankfully, graduation is
approaching and we will soon
be entering the workforce.
Thus, we will soon have a
vested interest in the dreaded

topic of taxes. Since all candi-
dates address the issue of taxes,
this is a far more relevant issue
for graduating seniors than for
freshmen. While I have been
paying taxes since I ﬁrst moved
here, it becomes more crucial
of an issue since my meager
paycheck will be soon rising.

For the masses of students
who left Friday night after
Jesse Jackson’s speech, you
not only made Washington and
Lee students appear rude but
you also missed a unique op-
portunity. Texas State Repre-
sentative Rose, former Senator
Moseley Braun and Richmond
Mayor Wilder all gave inspir-

My favorite part of Mose-

missed it, her 10-year-old niece

UNIVERSITY COMMONS ROOM. 341
WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

LEXINGTON VIRGINIA 24450

I thought you were sup-
posed to cheer after you
nominate your presidential
candidate. I guess not.

Let’s all give the Mock
Con leadership credit; they
did their job to the letter.

While the ﬂoor was chant-
ing “O-bam-a! O-bam-al”,
Waller and co’. declared—
without a hint of indeci-
sion—that Hillary Clinton
would win the White House.

Their prediction was the
product of countless hours
of research by them, the state
chairs and scores of other
students.

They probably gave us
the right answer. Hillary will
probably win the Democratic
nomination.

Damn.

The thing that struck me
about the scene is this—we
could not have engineered a
better picture of the problem
with our generation voting.

Obama is an exciting can-
didate.

The youngest voters have
adopted him as the next JFK,
the next great inspirational
American leader. He excites
young voters in a way that no
other candidate can.

At Mock Con we were
supposed to play house.

We were supposed to pre-
tend we were the delegates
who are headed to the DNC
in Colorado later this year.

These delegates—our

Mock Con research teams
tell us—like Hillary. They

“Sweetie, girls can be president,
too,” was what she then saw as
a white lie. It later inspired her
to not let that lie stand, and she
ran for president. When I met
and shook hands with Carol
Mosley Brown, I was struck by
the fact that she is an amazing
woman who has made signiﬁ-
cant differences for women in
politics.

Although I would hate to’

think this is the year that breaks
our record, I cannot help but
wish we predicted wrong and
that ‘Barack Obama will be our
next president. As Governor
Kaine suggests, Barack Obama,
“is about bringing people to-
gether and about unifying this
nation.” After all, can you re-
ally picture a Clinton bringing
Republicans and Democrats
together?

Although I sincerely be-
lieve it is far past time that.a
woman was elected president, I
am not conﬁdent Senator Clin-
ton is the best choice. I believe
she has the capability to win
the Democratic primary, but I
fear her election will margin-

look at her credentials and

policies, her networks and
' campaign team and they see
someone who can win.

For a brief while, though,
a majority of Washington
and Lee students forgot to
play house. They forgot to
pretend to like Hillary.

A perfect example—Al-
ice Shih announcing that the
great state of Texas allots
delegates to Hillary Clinton
while the entire delegation
is on its feet waving Obama
signs.

Umm...well, see if you
can grab a Hillary sign, I
guess.

Texas wasn’t alone.

I’m sure W&L’s public
relations people breathed a
silent prayer of thanks when
they found out it was Bill
Clinton on the phone instead
of his wife.

I’m not sure it would have
been good press for the sena-
tor to overhear the Obama
chants after we supposedly
nominated her.

Bill we love, if for no
other reason than the man
would probably be the ﬁrst
on the Pole 3 dance ﬂoor (see
Zollman’s, 1992).

If you think about it, the
symbolism is dead on.

Why do you think the
youngest American voters
don’t vote?

I’m not a political sci-
entist. I don’t quote de
Touqueville. But if I had
to guess, I’d say that young
voters are tired of tired can-
didates.

av

alize disgruntled Republicans
and keep the White House in
Republican hands. Even if she
is successful in becoming the
ﬁrst female president, her last
name will result in partisanship
for the next four years.

This weekend W&L stu-
dents were privileged to have
the opportunity to listen to es-
teemed guest speakers who all
have made signiﬁcant contri-
butions to our political system.
Mock Convention has previ-
ously chosen speakers with
promising futures in politics.
This year we continued this
tradition by listening to Har-
old Ford Jr. and Patrick Rose. I
ﬁrmly believe we will see these

, two individuals become strong

leaders in the Democratic Party
in years to come.

I sincerely hope that Mock
Convention inspired students
to become more involved in
our political process. It ener-
gized my enthusiasm for poli-
tics. Personally, I feel honored
to have listened to the speeches
of these highly regarded politi-
cians.

I hope Mock Con’s Wrong

We can ’t stand Hillary, crowd shouted “O-bam-a ”

Hillary has been around
for a while. I still disagree
with Congresswoman Fer-
raro about her “experience,”
but that’s another matter.
Experienced or not, she’s an
old hand.

Obama is young. He ex-
cites people, and, more im-
portantly, he excites young
people.

But if every exciting can-
didate for our generation
loses their nomination bids,
do you really expect young
voters to show up in force?

Absolutely not.

Maybe Mock Con should
have thrown their aspirations
of accuracy out ohe window.

Will it be accurate as a
predictive exercise that we
nominated Hillary?

Probably, and for that I
applaud those among us who
worked so hard to that end.

But was nominating a
candidate I don’t think many
in the student body can stand
the best use of our school’s
bully pulpit?

With national media at-
tention focused on little old
Lexington, W&L’s students
ofﬁcially predicted Hillary
would win. Ofﬁcially.

But the Obama chants
showed who we wanted to
win. I hate to ruin Wes Lit-
tle’s day, but I hope we got

it wrong.
If the chants,‘posters and
deﬂated students showed

anything, it’s that a lot of
them are secretly hoping the
same thing.

Sorry, Wes.

 

_§ Abortion  

"'5
on

a crime

Most diverse
Americans oppose
legal abortions

Dear Editor, ,

This is a response to Prof.
Melina Bell’s letter to the edi-
tor in the Dec. 3 issue.

In the words of Mahatma
Gandhi, “It seems to me as
clear as daylight that abortion
would be a crime.”

I agree with Prof. Bell’s
premise that sectarian views
should not be enforced by the
state. Given that premise, her argu-
ment for keeping abortion legal rests
on the claim that the pro-life position
is a “sectarian” view; therefore, it does
not reﬂect the fundamental beliefs of
all people in our culture.

This claim fails for two reasons.
The pro-life position is not sectarian
because it is held by so many people
from so many different backgrounds.

A recent Time magazine poll
showed 55 percent of Americans op-
pose legal abortions, except possibly
in rare cases of danger to the mother’s
life or rape/incest.

And it’s not just Christian conserva-
tives who oppose abortion. Do a search
on the web for pro-life organizations,
and you can ﬁnd many Jews, Muslims,
atheists and agnostics, liberals, femi-
nists, gays and lesbians and others who
oppose abortion.

The second reason why the claim
fails—this also explains the ﬁrst—is
that the pro-life position is derived
from very basic scientiﬁc and moral
principles. Religious doctrines are not
necessary.

Take the fact that a fetus is a human
being with its very own identity-I
don’t see Prof. Bell seriously disputing
this. Then add the fact that the fetus has
done nothing wrong, certainly nothing
warranting death.

Given the basic moral principle
that all innocent human beings have
a basic, inalienable right to life, it fol-
lows that the state ought to uphold the
fetus’s right to live.

Is being anti-slavery sectarian?

Is being anti-segregation sectarian?

Once upon a time one might have
said yes. So I’m not surprised the pro-
life position is beirig called sectarian
today.

I ﬁnd it interesting that Prof. Bell
compares slavery with abortion because
slavery is a case in which a clearly im-
moral practice was kept alive because
of cultural problems too ingrained to
eliminate using pure logic.

The same is true with abortion to-

day.

We can talk about “offering each
other reasons from within our shared
value system” all day long, but the real
reason abortion continues is that our
society has many structural problems
that need to be addressed. The pro-life
movement has taken practical steps to
address these problems.

Pro—lifers run organizations that
provide free healthcare to pregnant
women, post—abortive counseling,
adoption assistance, and even sexual
education programs. All of these orga-
nizations rely on the support of people
who are willing to act on their pro-life
convictions, not merely attack abortion
with heated rhetoric.

Their services help to provide a
model for a society that is both com-
passionate and responsible.

This is the long and difficult solu-
tion to the problems our culture faces
with unwanted pregnancies. But it is
the only real solution.

Abortion is given as a much quick-
er and easier solution, but such shallow
virtues can never justify killing inno-
cent human beings.

Abortion continues to be part of our
culture not because we really feel it is
justiﬁed, but rather because we feel it
is impossible to lose abortion.

In this way, it really is no different
from slavery—completely wrong, yet
completely ingrained in our culture.

As a country we ought to be clam-
oring for a state that recognizes this
and is willing to effect a change.

  Mock Convention  
parties a highlight  
  of the weekend  

Social aspects of the weekends
demonstrate excitement of L  
the convention and bring the
student body closer together‘

Byceleste Cruz-carandang
STAFF wamza

Work hard, play hard~—the mantra of all W&L students.
From the most diligent state chairs to the mysteriously absent

A delegates, all have felt the stress of Mock Convention. Thus,
it goes without saying that the celebrations of this year‘s cau- _

cus were perhaps just as memorable as the eventitself.

In the past few‘ days, states have been throwing inter?del-
egation mixers. The entire Western Region hosted a party at
Pole One on the Monday before Mock Convention. Wednes-
day evening, several of the smaller delegations, including
Delaware, Ohio, West Virginia, Kansas, Indiana, /‘Utah and
Guam, put‘ aside their time differences and celebrated under
one flag at Old House. That same night, Pole Three was home
to delegations such as Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina and
the Democrats Abroad. '

Interestingly enough, the settings of such mixers portend-_ I

ed the normal Washington and Lee revelry. Each locale was

familiar, as was the enjoyable pandenioniurn that ensued. Yet, O

those in attendance made each event different from the run-
of-the-mill gatherings. California State Chair, Kathryn Allen,

° commented, “The atmosphere was very similar to other W&L

parties--the setting was familiar, the drinks and games were

“The only.distz'nguishing factor was the
sort of atypical groups of students who -

were hanging out together... ”

familiar, the dancing was familiarly The oiilydistinguishing

factor was the sort of atypical groups of students who were
hanging out together, which made it a good opportunity to
meet some new people and step out of the social bubble in

which a lot of us get stuck...Mock Con. parties just allow us 7

to meet some new people, which is always fun.”
Despite the sense of community that the parties encour-
aged, the stress concerning the actual affair took its toll on the

students. For three weeks, those involved in Mock Conven- «

tion have lived and breathed research, contacts, predictions
and ﬂoat construction. It is no surprise, then, that a few hours
of carefree merriment should be awarded to them. “There
was a lot more heavy drinldng,” observed Valaree Tang, who
attended a few of Saturday night’s Mock Convention parties.
“I guess a bunch of people were just blowing off some steam.
They all worked so hard to pull together the parade and the

speakers and their predictions, that they justneeded some I

outlet when all their work was over.” _

D Unfortunately, some students crossed the line when it
came to alcohol and their own limits. Security guards report-
ed a student passed out in front of Grahan1~Lees,.who had to
go to the inﬁrmary. They warned students to considertheir.
decisions carefully and to take care of their friends. Anutnber

of students made visits to the health center, although the par- A

ties ended much earlier than most weekends.
Although there was bad news to report with the good,
Mocks Convention was an enormous success. Washington

and Lee did not only gain an enormous amount of prestige.

and notability, but was able to bring its students together: Al-
though ninety percent of the student body was under" more
than ﬁfty ﬂags, we were brought together under one cause,

’ under one event. So, whether we were right or wrong about

Hillary, I would say that we did Mock Convention right.

Cloverfield a good thrill

Monster ﬁlm a fan and exciting new twist on genre

By Grace Andrews
smrr WRITER

“What is that?” “Something
terrible.” “What is that?” “Some-
thing else, also terrible.” These
two quotes from the new J.J.

Abrams ﬁlm “Cloverﬁeld” semi—-

embody the reactions that this
ﬁlm elicits. The movie begins
with ofﬁcial government style
messages-that inform the viewer
that the tape is from what was
once Central Park. Soon after
that unfolds the story of Rob, his
brother Jason, Jason’s girlfriend
Lily, his best-friend Hud and
Hud’s mysterious crush Marlena.
Prior to the surprise party be-
ginning, Hud gets charged with
«manning the camera and captur-
ing “farewell” messages for Rob,
as he celebrates a job promotion
to Japan. During the party they
hear a thunderous noise from the
streets and run out to see what ap-
pears to be asteroids falling, as a
strange mist ﬁlls the city. What
ensues from there must be seen to
be believed, as a skyscraper-sized
creature destroys New York,
Manhattan in particular.
However, instead of escap-
ing when they have a chance, the
crew runs back into the city to
rescue a distressed Beth, who is
Rob’s best friend and love inter-
est. Our home-boy, Rob, gets hit
with a bout of knight-in-shining
armor syndrome and feels obliged
to save the lovely brunette, espe-
cially since his last words to Beth

. [were anything but well wishes.

Parade down Main Street a great success C

Marlena, the voice of reason,
expresses her reluctance to walk
into danger, especially since Beth
says something about being stuck
and bleeding, which means she
could be dead by the time they
get to her. Does anyone listen to
her? OF COURSE NOT, because
that would have actually made
sense! As this rag-tag gang make
their way into the heart of the city

that the movie unfolds from the
vantage point of the cameraman,
so think Blair Witch Project, but
better quality. This limits the au-
dience in the sense that we can’t
see everything, but the strong
sense of uncertainty adds to the
suspense and makes us feel like
we’re running through the streets
of New York, right along with the
crew.

Cloverﬁeld is as realistic as a mon-

ster movie can be.

The occurrences

within the ﬁlm are sudden, knee-jerk
and terrzfyingly confusing at times.

to rescue Beth, the U.S. military
works to evacuate the city, while
also attempting to annihilate the
monster.

Hud, the loveable idiot, seems
to be the movie’s comic relief,
mastering the art of ridiculous
lines at the most inopportune
time, while still maintaining his
job as cameraman. The audience
could not help but laugh during
the more intense scenes because
of Hud’s incredible talent for
saying the wrong thing. He was
deﬁnitely my favorite character.

What I liked most about the
ﬁlm is that you never really get a
clear view of the monster, further
adding to the terror of the ﬁlm.
It’s also important to remember

Now, if you are one of those
people who requires a plot that
tells the entire story from begin-
ning to end, then Cloverﬁeld is
not for you. I repeat, it’s not for
you. This ﬁlm starts suddenly in
the middle of a story, of which we
are never given the full details.
However, I argue that this “Insta-
movie,” add actors, monsters and
ﬁlm, has a little more meat than
some people give it credit for. For
instance, when Lily and Marlena
are running through the streets in
high heels and looking slightly
disheveled, but still beautiful,
I thought about how phony that
was, but my movie buddy, Aisha
Davis, explained to me the perks
of movie magic, a.k.a. make-up

and the impossibility of them
actually removing their shoes be-
cause of the debris. Nonetheless,
there is one scene where Lily
removes her three-inch stilettos
in order to properly climb stairs,
while huﬂing and pufﬁng like a
runaway train. Now, if that’s not
realistic, I don’t know what is.
Prior to writing this review, I
read some other reviews online,
and the biggest complaint seems
to be the abruptness of the end-
ing. However, I must contend
that Cloverﬁeld is as realistic as
a monster movie can be. The oc-
currences within the ﬁlm are sud-
den, knee-jerking and terrifying-
ly confusing at times, because if
a giant monster were to storm the

_streets today, almost everyone I

know would react as the charac-
ters in this movie did. Now, take
my statements for what they are
-opinion. If you wish to expe-
rience a ﬁlm like never before,
watch the movie. Is it worth
eight dollars? Maybe not, espe-
cially because of the abruptness
with which the movie ends. It
seemed to leave many in the the-
ater wanting more than what the
ﬁlm could give. So, if you don’t
like realism in ﬁlm, I recommend
you wait until it comes out on
DVD, pitch in with a bunch of
friends, and rent a night full of
fun! That way, you’ll only have
to pay about a dollar or so for the
latest twist on the monster genre.
So overall, I give this movie 7.75
out of 10 stars.

Mock Con is parade was a thrill for participants and spectators alike

By Klmber Wlggs
STAFF WRITER

The centennial Mock Con-
vention began Friday morning,
as men, women and children of
Lexington and beyond lined Main
Street to watch the long-awaited
Mock Con. parade. Though not
quite as long as I expected, the
parade was a once in a collegiate
lifetime experience, one that late-
risers were unfortunate to miss.

Wandering around Brewbaker
Field before the trailers began to
disembark, I saw the results of
all the hard work that went into
this parade. Some delegations
truly made their states proud with
sculptures, costuming and care-
fully applied coats of paint. Ha-
waii built a volcano; Washington,
the Space Needle; and Georgia,
a giant bottle of everyone’s fa-
vorite Classic soda. Other states
led me to wonder if they had as-
sembled their ﬂoats that very
morning. Even so, the mood was
upbeat,and it warmed my heart in

the freezing air.

In addition to the delegation
ﬂoats, three student bands played
on ﬂat beds during the parade.
Amid the roar of generators and
the fumes of gasoline, these mu-
sicians played their hearts out and

play an instrument.

I had the privilege of walking
beside West Virginia’s ﬂoat for
the event. Though not a native
West Virginian, I was neverthe-
less inspired by the outpouring
of WV pride from my fellow

I felt a surge of excitement every time some-

one recognized the New River Gorge Bridge

or the Mountaineer that were part of our
ﬂoat. I imagine other ﬂoat riders felt the

some pride when they, too, were ﬁnally recog-

nized for their hard work.

spilled their musical guts all over
Main Street. One band member
described his experience as “the
most dangerous gig I’ve ‘ever
played.” Not surprising, consid-
ering how easily one can fall off
a moving ﬂoat, even when he or
she is not also trying to sing and

delegates. Thanks to a CD with
the same track copied 22 times,
“Country Roads” was constantly
playing and I was faithfully sing-
ing along. To add to the joy of
the occasion, members of the del-
egation passed out candy to pa-
rade-goers. Shiny-eyed children

thanked them profusely as their
out-stretched hands received giﬁs
of chocolaty goodness.

Without a doubt, the best part
of the parade was watching the
on-lookers. Though shivering
in the 30—degree morning, the at-
tendees were happy to be present
and returned our greetings with
waves and smiles. I felt a surge

of excitement every time some-.

one recognized the New River
Gorge Bridge or the Mountain-
eer that were part of our ﬂoat. I
imagine other ﬂoat-riders felt the
same pride when they, too, were
ﬁnally recognized for their hard
work.

In the end, the big prize went
to the Texas delegation. The an-
nouncement was met with some
disappointment by states who
seemed to think they deserved the
win. But to Texas’ credit, that Al-
amo replica was pretty cool. And
even if only one ﬂoat could be the
best in the land, that doesn’t make
the process any less special or the
clowns any less creepy.

' Despite long sessions, students enjoy A-list speakers

Jesse Jackson and Charlie Wilson draw the biggest hype, but Cleland is surprising performance wins him some new fans

Henderson
smrr wrmsns

The long-awaited weekend
of Washington and Lee’s centen-
nial Mock Convention brought
diverse student responses to the
festivities and results.

A parade of ﬂoats built

by the delegations kicked off the

convention on Friday morning.
The parade participants as well as
the onlookers enjoyed themselves
as the ﬂoats rolled down Main
Street, though many complained
about the cold weather.

“Being on the ﬂoat was a lot
of fun,” said freshman Victoria
Taylor, delegate for the territory
of Guam. “There were only ﬁve
people on our delegation, and
three of us got to ride on the ﬂoat.
We were in between Florida and

Hawaii so we blended in because
we all had a tropical theme.”

“It’s a tie between Mississippi
and Maine,” freshman and New
York delegate Anne Parlato said,
speaking of her favorite ﬂoats.
“Maine had sword-ﬁghting lob-
sters, but I liked Mississippi with
the camo and guns.”

Delaware Attorney General
Joseph R. “Beau” Biden com-
manded the room with a direct,
clear delivery, giving the session’s
second address. “He certainly had
a presence,” said sophomore Nev-
ille Foggarty.

Geraldine A. Ferraro, Former
New York U.S. Representative
and Vice Presidential candidate,
spoke later that afternoon, to the
joy of many New York residents
and delegates.

“I love her. She’s fabulous,”
sophomore Jessie Wang of New

York said. “I’ve worked with a lot
of politicians in New York, and
she’s someone I’ve always ad-
mired. She’s a role model.”

Senior Katelyn Finley of the
Puerto Rico delegation, however,
felt there was a “generational dis-
connect” between Ferraro, who
spoke of equality for women, and
the audience of college students.
“Her generation has had to ﬁght
for their equality while my gen-
eration doesn’t have to ﬁght so
much,” Finley said.

Arguably, the two most an-
ticipated speakers were Rever-
end Jesse L. Jackson and for-
mer U.S. Texas Representative
Charles Wilson. As the subject
of the recent movie “Charlie Wil-
son’s War” starring Tom Hanks,
Wilson’s celebrity status clearly
made him a popular speaker. But
Hanks himself could not do jus-

tice to the ready humor, reassur-
ing demeanor; and sheer charm
that won audience members over
on Friday afternoon.

Wilson delivered the last ad-
dress of the ﬁrst session, sharing
stories of his call to politics and
experience in the Cold War. “I
thought it was really interesting,”
said junior Tara Hildenbrand,
native and delegate of Texas, in
response. “I never knew who he
was before. It was an inspiring
story.” I

Other students were disap-
pointed that Wilson did not “com-
ment on our convention and the
youth involvement,” as freshman
Hannah Muther, delegate of Illi-
nois, said.

Former US. Senator Max Cle-
land, who lost both legs and one
arm in the Vietnam War, gave a
stirring speech during the sec-

ond session on Saturday punctu-
ated with Methodist jokes. The
audience found this segment of
the convention highly entertain-
ing. “Best speech ever! That was
brilliant!” said junior Michael
Gretchen, chair of the Louisiana
delegation.

Reverend Jesse L. Jackson’s
speech on Saturday night met
with applause but also with mixed
reactions from the student del-
egates. “I might think he’s crazy,
but I found it entertaining,” said
freshman Greg Franke, delegate
and native of Maryland.

With a sense of raw power,
Jackson invoked audience mem-
bers to take action against inequal-
ity. As senior Nicole Morello put
it, “he was really able to move the
emotions of the crowd.”

Senior Dan Harris said of
Jackson’s speech, “it was really

the highlight of the convention.”
The convention served as a
learning opportunity for many.
Freshman Nay Lin, an intema-
tional student from Burma, at-
tendedrthe Mock Convention to
learn more about the American
political system. He said it is
much more difﬁcult to be politi-

I cally active in Burma where de-

mocracy is limited. In America,
Lin said, “you can do anything if
you put effort into it.”

Midwest regional chair Shane
Wilson spoke of the purpose of
Mock Convention and its suc-
cess in involving youth. “If noth-
ing else, this is going to spark an
interest, spark a passion,” Wilson
said. “This brings the most impor-
tant issues of our time to the stu-
dents to combat the widespread
apathy in our generation.”

Giants not second best

The Neil(l)s break down the Super Bowl between the Patriots and Giants

By Nelll Thuparl and Nell
Sheaffer «
coLu M msrs

First oﬂ are these the two
best teams in the NFL?

NS: Nope. The Patriots are
by far the best team in the NFL.
and probably the best team ever,
so they are a no-brainer at the
number one spot. Do I even need
to try and provide an explanation

for that? I hope not. Are the Gi-V

ants the second best team in the
NFL? No, I don’tthin.k so. Now,
I think that most people are going
to throw everything I’m about to
write out the window because the
Giants really have been playing
well recently, but I’ve got to stick
to my opinions and the season
as a whole. I think the Chargers
are the second best team«'in the
league. The Chargers gave the
Patriots a legitimate run for their
money, and I really believe that
a healthy LT would have gotten
them touchdowns in the red zone.
I could also make an argument
for the Colts as the best team
other than the Patriots, but a very
beat-up Chargers team took out
a reasonably beat-up Colts team
in Indianapolis, so I have to give
the edge to the Chargers. So ba-
sically it comes down to this: The
AFC is the best conference, and is
home to the top three teams in the
league, the Patriots, Chargers and
Colts. As far as the NFC goes,
I still think that the Packers and
Cowboys are the better teams.

NT: It’s tough for me to say
this because the Giants have been
playing so spectacularly in these
past few weeks, but I don’t think

there’s any  that these aren’t:
tlib two best teams in the NFL. ‘'

First, there are the New England
Patriots. A record breaking 18-
0 during the regular season and
playoffs so far while shattering
numerous records, both individ-
ual and team, along the way. No
one can argue with their being the
absolute best team in the league,
and if you’re Chris Collinsworth,
they’re the best team ever to
grace a football ﬁeld. However,
looking at the overall body of
work, strength of schedule and,
more importantly, strength of
conference, I think that both
the San Diego Chargers and In-
dianapolis Colts are better teams
than this year’s Giants. Don’t
get me wrong; I am not taking

anything away from New York’s
great victories over Dallas and
Green Bay, two teams that beat
them handily earlier this season,
but if you examine the overall
body of work of the Giants juxta-
posed to that of the Chargers and

l Colts, it’s hard for me to say they

are better. One could even argue,
as Neil has done, that even the
Cowboys and Packers are better
than the Giants, and I wouldn’t
be totally opposed to that idea ei-
ther, but I’m going to give them
the beneﬁt of the doubt because
of their playoff wins. Nonethe-
«less, they are the hottest team in

_jthe NFL, and momentum is ab-
solutely vital to winning in this

league, so you can’t count them
out just yet.

and I realized that there are an
innumerable amount of veter-
ans, any of whom are capable of
providing a game-changing per-
formance for this New England
squad. So, the fact of the matter
is, there are literally dozens upon
dozens of reasons that the Patriots

will win the Super Bowl. In fact, '

you could have an entire column
dedicated to completely viable
reasons the Patriots will win the
Superbowl and it may be three or
four times longer than this piece
Neil and I are writing. With that
being said, I’m going to say that
because of New England’s third
ranked rushing defense being
able to stop the Giants running
back combination of Ahmad
Bradshaw and Brandon Jacobs,
thereby putting the entire weight

, Since losing on opening weekend in Dallas,

the New York Giants have won I 0 consecutive

games on the road, including at Dallas and at ,

Lambeau Field in subzero temperatures. This

makes them the hands-down most dangerous

team to la an where at an time.
P J’ J’ J’
 

Tell us why the Patriots will
win this Sunday in Glendale,
AZ...

NT: Hm, where to begin?
I could start with their incred-
ible perfect record or their NFL
MVP winning Quarterback in
Tom Brady or the fact that they
have already beaten the New

§York Giant§ barely a month be-
"fore thag Siiperlibwl. fcould even

talk about their NFL Coach of the
Year, Bill Belichick, the domi-

'nance of their unheralded offen-

sive line, and the inability for any
team in the league to cover and
stop each and every single one of
their weapons on offense, from
Wes Welker to Randy Moss to
Laurence “Lo’Mo” Maroney to
Mike Vrabel and the list goes on.
Combine each of the aforemen-
tioned things with the fact that
New England’s defense is led by
a number of seasoned veterans
such as Junior Seau, Tedy Brus-
chi, Richard Seymour, Adalius
Thomas, Asante Samuel and, oh
my goodness, while looking up
names to list in this section Neil

of the game on Quarterback Eli
Manning’s shoulders and having
him self—destruct with a few care-
less interceptions, the New Eng-
land Patriots will win Superbowl
XLII.

NS: The Patriots are the best
team and won’t lose. Instead I’ll
write about Tom Brady. THE

‘._B_.OOT:— Igoeswnobody in the
whole media world realize that’

Tom Brady is not hurt at all? The
Patriots are toying with the me-
dia and everyone else that fell for
it. He doesn’t show up during the
first ﬁfteen minutes of practice,
and they say that he’s not prac-
ticing? Reporters can only watch
the ﬁrst ﬁfteen minutes. Antonio
Pierce says that he’s not hurt, so
they aren’t fooling the Giants.
Why is such a big deal made out
of this? I’m tired of it.

NT: Real great analysislthere,
Neil. Ground-breaking stuff.

Tell us why the Giants will win
this Sunday in Glendale, AZ...

NS: Not happening. Didn’t
they already lose to the Patriots‘?

NT: Okay, unlike my com-
patriot here, I’m actually going

to have a stab at this one. Since.

losing on opening weekend in
Dallas, the New York Giants
have won 10 consecutive games
on the road, including at Dallas
and at Lambeau Field in subzero
temperatures. This makes them
the hands-down most dangerous
team to play anywhere at any-
time. Fourth year Quarterback
Eli Manning is blossoming into
a big-garne superstar, much like
he was at Ole Miss. In the play-
offs he has shown a maturity
reminiscent of his older brother
Peyton, and he has demonstrated
an uncanny ability to manage the
game properly when the ball is
in his hands. Behind the rush-
ing tandem of Ahmad Bradshaw,
who did not play in their week 17
matchup, and Brandon Jacobs,

Manning has been able to ﬁnd

his comfort zone in the offense
and continue to play at a higher
level that Giants fans have been
praying for. However, New York
is most certainly not‘ a one—di-
mensional team. Their defense
is anchored by arguably the best
defensive line in the league led
by DE’s Michael Strahan and Osi
Umenyiora. This terrorizing two-
some will be putting pressure on
Brady all game, forcing him to
step outside of the box and make
tight passes to beat them. Along
those same lines, gritty Defen-
sive backs Aaron Ross and Sam
Madison have, as of late, been
styrnieing opposing wide receiv-

ll

ers to no end. As long as they.

continue their physical, fearless
coverage on the Patriots’ Moss,
Welker, Gaffney, and whoever
else New England may throw out
there, the Giants have a very real
chance at forcing turnovers, and
leaving Glendale, AZ with the
Lombardi Trophy.
i

We hope that this sheds some
light on this year’s Super Bowl
for you, and as always special
thanks to Neil Sheaffer for help-
ing us out. Don’t forget to join us
again next week as we wrap up
the NFL Season and take a look
back at the moments that made
this year such a memorable one
in NFL history.

Lewis says it’s Eli’s turn in Super Bowl

terbacks to throw for 23 or more.

COLUMNISTS

“But mom, why does Peyton
get to go? I never get to do any-
thing!”

“Now son, he’s a lot older
than you. More mature. You’re
simply not ready.”

“But. . .but. . .I am ready!
Look! I’m dressed in blue too,
with plenty of padding! Plus,
I’m almost as tall as Peyton. I
promise I’ll keep up.

“A ‘no’ is a ‘no,’ end of dis-
cussion.”

“But, .but. . .”

“But nothing. You’ll have
your chance to go soon enough.”

And just like that, young Pey-
ton Manning went off to his ﬁrst
amusement park, leaving little
brother Eli behind. And while Eli
slumped away in jealousy and re-
sentment towards his older broth-
er, he knew deep down that one
day, he too would get a chance to
go to the theme park. He just had
to wait until he was ready.

Fifteen or so years later, noth-
ing changed. At this time last
year, Olivia Manning still had to
remind her youngest son that he
was “simply not ready.” Peyton
was an older, more mature and
more complete quarterback. He
was ready to ride to the top of
football’s largest roller coaster——
the Super Bowl.

Now, one year after Peyton’s
remarkable ride, it’s Eli’s turn.
No one can say he’s not good
enough. No one can say he’s not

experienced enough. No one can
say he’s not ready. ‘

Having faced arguably the
most scrutiny in the last ﬁve
years of any New York athlete
not named Alex Rodriguez, Eli
Manning has made his way from
Peyton’s under-achieving young-
er brother to the quarterback
leading the NFC Champions into
Super Bowl XLII. And though
he may look as old as he is in the
above conversation, he sure as
hell isn’t playing like it.

First, he marched through
Tampa Bay and Jeff Garcia, who

of Manning’s mistake—free foot-
ball, a strong running game and a
solid defense led the Giants past
Brett Favre and the Packers. And,
despite the below-zero weather,
Manning looked even more com-
fortable than F avre. Who knows,
maybe he was wearing Favre’s
Wrangler jeans.

I know what you’re think-
ing. Eli is the Trent Dilfer of this
year’s playoffs—sneaking into
the roller coaster that is the Su-
per Bowl by merely limiting his
mistakes and praying for dear life
that he doesn’t slip through his

had beaten the Giants twice be-
fore in the playoffs.

Next, he went into Dallas
to take on Tony Romo, Jessica
Simpson and the highly favored
Cowboys. And with a 132.4
passer rating, Manning powered
the Giants to victory, while si-
multaneously preparing some
popcorn for T.O.

Then, on the frozen tundra of
Lambeau Field, the combination

~ seat belt and fall off because he

was never ready in the ﬁrst place.
Well, the answer is no, and here’s
why.

Eli is one of four quarterbacks
to lead his team to the playoffs
in each of the past three seasons.
His company? Peyton Manning,
Tom Brady, and Matt Hassel-
beck. I hear those guys are pretty
good. Not convinced?

Okay, Eli is one of ﬁve quar-

touchdowns in each of the past
three years. His company? Car-
son Palmer, Peyton Manning,
Tom Brady, and Drew Brees.
Not too shabby, huh?

I could continue, but if you’re
not on the Eli bandwagon yet,
then no statistic will serve to cor-
rect the very little sports knowl-
edge that you have. Plus, let’s
face it, actions speak louder than
words, and the action of getting
to the Super Bowl says enough.

Speaking of words versus ac-
tions, let’s reexamine the com-
ments of former teammate turned
journalistic traitor Tiki Barber
back in August. Tiki bashed Eli
for his on- and off—ﬁeld leader-
ship, stating, “Sometimes it was
almost comical the way he would
say things.” To me, the only
thing that is comical about Eli’s
most recent on-ﬁeld actions is the
fact that he did them without Tiki
(and Jeremy Shockey, for that
matter).

As the Super Bowl approach-
es, it is only a matter of time be-
fore we see how ready Eli Man-
ning actually is. And while some
may say that a poor performance
on the part of Eli would halt the
roller coaster mid-track, I say
that Eli can put his hands in the
air and wave jokingly to Peyton
as he experiences the rush of
football’s greatest ride, because
win or lose, Eli is most deﬁnitely
ready.

Generals on second four game streak, win eight of nine

By Hank Nathan
smrr warran-

The Washington & Lee
Men’s Basketball team won all
three of its games this past week

' en route to the second four-game .

winning streak of the season. 1

The Generals traveled to
Emory & Henry College on
Wednesday, a place where the
team had not won a game in
10 years. However, this year’s
team is different and seems to
have the propensity to pull out
the close games.

Coach Adam Hutchinson
attributed the ability to win
the close ones to growing as a
team. _ ‘ ‘

“The maturity of our se-
niors and juniors is the foremost
thing in my mind [that enables
the team to come through in
the close games],” said Coach
Hutchinson. “Those guys have
played a lot ofclose games over
the course of their careers, so
pretty much any situation that
arises, we have been in before.”

The game against Emory &
Hemy mirrored the progression
of the team ‘over the past few
years“.

In the ﬁrst half, the two teams
played even at the Wasps’ fast
paced run-and-shoot style with
ﬁve ties and four lead changes.
The score was 52-54 at half, fa-

Women drop ODAC

By Russweems
STAFF WRITER I

' ~ The women’s basketball team
continued their ODAC schedule
this week with games against
Randolph-Macon and Bridge-
water. They came into the week
3-6 in the conference.

W&L started the week
Tuesday against 20th ranked
Randolph Macon. The Yellow
Jackets came into the game one
of the top teams in the ODAC
with only one loss. The Gener-
als kept it close in the ﬁrst half,’
which featured 8 lead changes
and 3 ties. Near the end of the

voting E&H.

The Generals, right on cue,
opened up the second half on an
8-0 run and never looked back.
The team was only up by six
points withslightly less than 19
minutes to play, but that didn’t
matter. W&L controlled the
game the rest of the way, con-
tent to beat the Wasps at their
own rapid up-and-down game.

W&L broke Emory & Hen-

,ry’s press with ‘ease, resulting

in layup aﬂer layup. The ﬁnal
score was 116-105. Sophomore
Zac White had three dunks in
the effort, a rarity in Division

-Illibasketball, as he compiled a

career-high 26 points.

Senior captain Greg Bi-
enneman also notched his ca-
reer-high with 36 points. Fellow
captain Femi Kusimo added in
22 of his own.

Junior captain Isaiah Good-
man reiterated Coach Hutchin-
son’s sentiments about how far
the team has come.

“We played much more con-
ﬁdent and relaxed this year than
we have in years past,” said
Goodman. “We have learned
a lot from those close games,
and we are ﬁnally putting it all
together. When we get in those
tough situations, we realize that
we have all been through it to-
gether.” ,. '

The Generals then traveled

ﬁrst half, the Yellow Jackets
went on a run and closed with
a seven point advantage, 30-23.
After the half, W&L came out
energized and went on a 9-4 run
led by the play of Amanda Kane.
Thisjeut the lead to a mere two
points (34-32). However this
was a back a forth game. Ran-
dolph Macon outscored the Gen-
erals 12-3 in the next 7 minutes
and led by a score of 46-35 with
6:46 remaining. W&L_got as
close a seven on two occasions,
but could not get any closer.
Randolph Macon went 8-9 from

. the line in the ﬁnal 1:30 to seal

the deal, leaving the ﬁnal score

to Lynchburg College. W&L
continued its strong shooting
performance from the previous
game, hitting 60 percent of its
shots in the ﬁrst half. The team
went into the locker room with a
15 point advantage, 37-22.

The Hofnets came out ﬁr-
ing from behind the~arc in the
second half, hitting ﬁve three-
pointers in the ﬁrst six minutes
of the half. I

A relentless Lynchburg team
went on a 23-9 run to cut the
score to three with less than 11
minutes to play, but that was as
close as they would get.

Bienneman, as he has“done,i V

all year long, put out the ﬁre
with a 17-foot jump shot as the
shot clock expired. On the next
possession, Bienneman knocked
down a layup oﬁ‘ of a pass from

junior Chris McHugh while be-.

ing fouled.

Bienneman did the exact
same thing moments later, this
time the pass came from Kusi-
mo. -The two and-one’s ignited
the Generals the rest of the way.
The conversion on the free throw
put the team back up by more
than 10. In fact, W&L hit all 13
of their foul‘ shots in the game in
uncharacteristic fashion.

The Generals continued to
increase their lead from then on

and ﬁnished the game with the‘

same 15 point margin that they

winning 77-62.

On Sunday, the Generals
downed the Hampden-Sydney
Tigers 66-51. The Generals
jumped out to an early lead in a
low scoring contest.

They held a 32-17 advantage
at. halftime and maintained a
double-digit advantage through-
out most of the second half. A
late charge allowed the Tigers to
close to within ﬁve points with
ﬁve minutes remaining. but two

quick baskets for the Generals
put the game out of reach.

A three point play by Bi-
enneman pushed the lead into
double digits and the Generals
were able to run out the clock
for their fourth win in a row.

Washington & Lee is now 10-
5 overall and 6-2 in conference.
The Generals had an identical

10-5 record last year before los-

ing nine of their last 10 games
down the stretch. Goodman says
the team will have to stay sharp

in order to reverse the bad for-
tune of last year. i
“The team is doing well [this
year]; we started the year 10-5
last year, but did not ﬁnish well,”
said Goodman. “We have to stay
more disciplined and focused
than ever before to accomplis
what we want to do.” '

games against R-M and Bridgewater

Women rally late against Bridgewater but come up short as Timberlake s free throw wins the game for the Eagles

68-57. W&L played good de-
fense, holding the Yellow Jack-
ets to a mere 38.1 percent, but

. they were killed by 24 turnovers.

W&L had some players step
up with strong games. Senior
forward Kristen Krouchick led
W&L with a» big performance,
providing 18 points and seven
rebounds. Amanda _Kane had
13 of her 14 points in the sec-
ond half. Junior guard Bethany
Ridenhour also was in double
ﬁgures with 10 points.

The Generals returned to ac-

Bridgewater. The beginning of
the game was closely contested‘

with nine lead changes and two
ties. Bridgewater started to pull
away near the end of the ﬁrst
half. The Eagles built a 7 point
lead with 3:20 to play in the first
half. W&L battled back to close
the half, scoring the ﬁnal ﬁve
points of the half in the last 7
seconds. Bridgewater came out
strong after the half and jumped
out to an eight point lead. The
Hornets maintained this advan-
tage for much of the half and
led by nine twice within the ﬁ-

_ nal six minutes of the contest.

The Generals were not going

extend the lead to ﬁve. W&L
countered with threes on back-
to-back possessions to tie the,
game up. However, on the last
possession Bridgewater’s Jes-
sica Timberlake was fouled with

may have gotten to her as she
missed the ﬁrst, but she coolly
