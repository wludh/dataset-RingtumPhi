Giving back: a W&L tradition

From community tutoring to Derby Days to Volunteer Venture, students are involved

By Rosemary Kelley
8 TA F F W R IT E R

The year has ended and the
Washington and Lee commu-
nity has once again excelled in
reaching out and giving back.

Ghandi’s message inspires
our student service leaders to
“be the change they wish to see
for the future.”

Dana Smith, the assistant di-
rector of Student Activities and
Greek Life, said “While we are
a small community, we come
together to support each other
to make a difference in our local
community.”

Student involvement in com-
munity service is pervasive and
ranges across every discipline.

Upon entry to W&L, stu-
dents are immediately given the
opportunity to immerse them-
selves in meaningful service.

The Volunteer Venture pro-
gram, for example, allows
participants to learn about the
needs of some of the poorest
Southeastern communities.

Upperclassmen students
who want to enrich the experi-
ence for others lead these trips
for entering freshmen. These
trips work to enhance the char-
acter of the involved students,
providing a hands-on way to
help others.

Traveling to Roanoke,
Greensboro, Washington D.C.
and eastern rural Kentucky and
staying in Lexington provide
each new student the oppor-
tunity to sacriﬁce time to help
others.

Tutoring students of Rock-
bridge County schools in sub-
jects from English to math-
ematics is another way W&L
students~activcly participate in
the community.

The incoming Rockbridge
County tutoring volunteer co-
ordinator, Celeste Cruz-Caran-
dang believes that we are role
models for those involved.

She said, “In mentoring, we
create a sense of focus and re-
sponsibility among the students

hclpcd. By providing this ser-
vice in all areas of study at all
age levels, we inspire those
helped to provide the same ef-
forts for the future.”

The Greek organizations also
provide ample opportunities to
give back.

Phi Epsilon and Kappa Alpha
Theta partnered to host a bas-
ketball tournament, and Pi Beta
Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma
hosted a carwash beneﬁting the
Rockbridge Area Transportation
System (RATS).

Sororities and fraternities

“While we are a small community, we come

together to support each other to make a dif-

ference in our local community. ”

DANA SMITH, Assistant Dlrector of Student Actlvltles and

Greek Llfe

Just this semester, large
sums of money were raised by
Greek organizations in the name
of charity.

Sigma Chi’s Derby Days was
a week-long philanthropic ﬁeld
day involving all ﬁve sororities.
Kappa Kappa Gamma threw a
volleyball tournament, Sigma

also provide hundreds of hours
of service throughout the rest of
the school year. For example, a
carnival is hosted in the fall for
local children.

National service organiza-
tions have also achieved im-
mcnse success at W&L. Several
local efforts include Habitat for

Humanity, First Book, Up ‘Til
Dawn and the Campus Kitchens
Project.

Our First Book chapter held
a speed read for an entire week
to raise money to buy books
for Natural Bridge Elementary
School.

Habitat for Humanity has
raised thousands of dollars and
volunteered hundreds of labor
hours to build houses for Rock-
bridge County.

The local Up ‘Til Dawn
chapter raised over $20,000 this
year for St. Jude’s Children’s
Research Hospital.

Begun in 2006, W&L’s Cam-
pus Kitchens Project provides
nutritious meals to local agen-
cies, non-proﬁts and individual
homes throughout the commu-
nity.

On a philanthropic level, our
students raise thousands of dol-
lars for charity.

The organization, Students
Against Rockbridge Area Hun-
ger hosts a Lip ‘Sync event ev-

ery winter term.

W&L also has groups that
provide service to the intema-
tional community.

Several religious organiza-
tions take service trips to im-
povcrished countries. Last year,
RUF went to Peru to build a
community center that would
house a church, a school, an
after—school program, and
clinic. -

This year, GCF went to Be-
quia to build _a house for the pas-
tor of a church for the village.
CCM hosted an acoustic eve-
ning to raise funds for the sister

parish of St. Patrick’s Catholic.

Church in Haiti.

Moreover, Project Nicaragua
travels every spring break to as-
sist in the poorest village com-
munitics on the east coast of the
country.

tion for International Learning,

Tragedy, trauma, and denial Faculty debate free SPGGCH, Sex

Campus controversy encourages meaningful discussion

Davis shares, discusses introspection into WWII atomic bombings

By Jamle Klm
srmr wmran

Trauma aﬁbrds us the valuable
opportunity to learn something
about ourselves, said Walter Davis,
visiting professor from Ohio State
University.

In a speech held in the Science
Center last Thursday, Davis began
his speech by describing a picture
that he saw when he was in the sev-
enth grade. The picture featured a
baby with a deformed face and dis-
torted limbs.

He said, “I was so arrested by
that image. There was something
between image and word that was
incompatible.”

Davis went on to discuss the
atomic bombings of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki during World War II. He
argued that while the official rea-
sons for dropping atomic bombs
on Japan was to end- the war and
save lives, the real reasons were
disguised.

According to Davis, the real
motivations were “to avenge Pearl
Harbor, to create a laboratory to
study the aﬁer-elfect of the bomb,
to justify the amount of money
spent on the bomb and to impress
the Russians during the Cold War.”

Davis believes this truth has
been repressed for a long time,
and many people still do not know
about it. ‘

“You can disprove a myth, but
that doesn’t mean it won’t live on
because myth serves an ideological
function,” he said.

After a few moments of silence,
Davis threw rhetorical questions
to the audience: “What was the
bomb? What did it signify as a hu-
man event? What did that mean?”

“The use of the bomb was im-
plicit in its invention,” he said,
quoting Robert Oppenheimer, a

physicist who was the science di-
rector of the Manhattan Project.
“The human mind had been able
to unlock the secrets of nature and
turn them into the human expres-
sion of power.”

After the war, many people suf-

fered from trauma and believed
that closure was necessary in order
to overcome that trauma, said Da-
vis.
He argued that those individu-
als have ill will toward tragic ex-
periences and think that they are
always abhorrent.

“That usually is a ﬂight from
those experiences. You can blind
yourself to reality in willful ways,”
he said. “We run away from our-
selves.”

Freshman Granvil George ex-
pressed a different opinion abou
Davis’s statement. '

“I think Davis made a valid
point that modern society avoids
confronting trauma,” he said, “but
his statements that closure is not
important were contradicted‘ by his
position that we must acknowledge
and use trauma — that is ‘actual-
ly probably the most effective form
of closure.”

Freshman Diane Tran agreed
that closure doesn’t necessarily
mean that trauma is being avoided.

“Closure, to me, simply is the
deﬁnitive moment where you make
the decision that the trauma is no
longer going to overtake your life,”
she said.

“I do agree, however, that
trauma should be confronted with
boldness and it most certainly pro-
vides an opportunity to learn about
ourselves, even though trauma is
not something I would wish on
anyone.”

Davis then opened the ﬂoor to
discussion. ‘

One audience member rebutted
Davis’s previous mention of the
reasons for dropping the atomic
bombs. He acknowledged Davis’s
four “real” reasons, but he also
supported the “official” reasons of
ending the war and saving lives.

“We should never use a weap-
onry that we don’t know what its
consequence is going to be,” he
said, “but I think you should walk
around the whole thing.”

He explained that being too
extreme on one side is not very
helpful to convince many people.
“There is some middle ground that
we have to walk upon,” he said.

Davis agreed but drove his own
point further.

“Any time you deny something,
you’re going to do it again,” he
said.

“Perception is learned. The
more you let those perceptions into
your consciousness, the less likely
it’s going to happen again in the
future.” _.

Freshman Victor Jackson said
that he was able to grapple with the
opinions and thoughts that Davis
was giving in a more casual discus-
sion format. « '

“While my views haven’t
changed much — I’ve always

thought the atomic bombing of

Japan was an atrocity — I feel like
I understand my views better, and
understand the overall point better,
that we as a nation are tragically
overlooking moral issues we have
faced in the past and are slowly
buckling under the strain of hav-
ing these things on our conscious-
ness.”

contlnued from page 1

“How can the community learn acceptable and
unacceptable behaviors if big, scandalous events
are always covered by half-bits of information,
innuendo, behind-the-scenes measures, and a
lack of consistent, public information?” Mayock
asked in her post.

Students as well as faculty have been allowed
to contribute to the forum, and many have ap-
plauded this opportunity.

“Just because the governing bodies on campus
have heard their cases doesn’t mean that the prob-
lem is solved,” Regina Mills said. “In this forum,
people can express their full opinions without
fear of misrepresentation or having their argu-
ments weakened or misunderstood by editing.”

Like many contributors to the forum, Mills
contrasts “Speaking Freely” with the arena of
discussion provided by campus newspapers.

“It extends past the limited circulation of stu-
dent publications,” she said. “Its more focused
goal allows for more nuanced discussion. A
newspaper has to go on to new things; it can’t
be peddling the same news about the Bracket in
December.” <

Going beyond the issue of free speech, Mills
would like to see the forum facilitate change
on campus. “The real goal is to see this passion
about changing our campus, whether it is the hor-
rendous gender issues in everyday campus life or
the anti-intellectualism outside of the classroom,
put into action.”

several international efforts. This past week they
fundraised for Burmese cyclone victims and the
Chinese Red Cross.

Another student group, Action.Change.To-
morrow (ACT) hosted the Guns ‘N Dolls con-
cert. The concert was aimed at raising awareness
about the use of children as soldiers in Uganda’s
civil war.

A cornerstone of the community service effort‘

on campus is Nabors Service League.

The organization was founded in honor of J on-
athan Nabors, a W&L student who was killed in a
car crash on I-81 in January 1999. His classmates
established the service league after his death.

NSL is the service organization that not only
performs service on campus and in the commu-
nity, but also aims to connect the W&L student
population to a variety of community service and
philanthropic events.

Jenna Walls, a member ofNSL, believes com-
munity service is immensely. powerful and. af-

fords the volunteer personal satisfaction like no
other. I

She said, “As students of Washington and Lee,
we are all given opportunities and experiences
that others do not receive at other schools and in
other communities. I think it is extremely impor-
tant to give back to the community of Rockbridge
County. We have the ability to get involved at so
many levels, any interest you have, you can ﬁnd
others within our university who share the same
interest.”

She added, “In working with other students
on community service efforts, I receive so much
pleasure out of helping others, viewing their hap-
piness, and uniting my fellow students to partici-
pate in the community.”

General connection:
ubiquitous alumni

You can ’t escape alumni once you enter the real world

By Grace Andrews
c 0 L u M N I s T

Just the other day, I was talk-
ing to a ﬁiend who went to New
York City on a trip. While there,
he ran into another person who
happened to have graduated

, from here a few years ago.

Now wait, before you disre-
gard my delightfully little anec-
dotal story, this episode exempli-
ﬁes my point. My friend ran into
this alum in an elevator in some
random apartment complex in
New York City. Now in a city
full of millions of people, what
are the chances that he would
run into a former student of our
prestigious institution?

My friend Jamila has a simi-
lar story, except hers takes place
in North Carolina at the doctor’s
ofﬁce. Apparently, she was
wearing a W&L sweatshirt dur-
ing her visit and when the doctor
saw it, he commented on how he
also went to W&L.

Now this wasn’t some rinky
dink doctor with a stethoscope
and Clark Kent glasses. No,
this doctor was the head sur-
geon and he insisted that Jamila
contact him if she were to ever
need anything. Doesn’t that just
sound too good to be true?

I can’t help but wonder how
many times I tell people that I at-
tend W&L and then get a blank
stare in response. Alter telling
them about W&L, they usually
ask if it’s in Washington, D.C.,
then they ask if it’s William &

Mary. So, how is it that alums
seem to come out of the wood-
work at the randomest moments,
when most people don’t even
know we exist?

I would bet my beloved right
foot that you, the reader, have
encountered similar situations.
I promise,‘ it feels like the other
day I was walking by a tree and
it told me that it was a W&L
alum. . .Ok, so maybe trees can’t
talk or go to school, but if they

attempt to get her attention,
throws a few leaves in her direc-
tion. Graciella, thinking it’s the
wind, keeps moving.

Suddenly, the tree feels as if
an opportunity to share a mo-
ment with a current student is
passing by, so it commences to
beat Graciella with its branches.
Graciella, in a state of terror,
runs far, far away. In her mind,
a tree tried to physically assault
her. She may now develop a

In a city full of million of people, what are

the chances he would run into a former stu-

dent? I feel that after graduating from here,
I ’ll be more connected than Cingular/AT&T

could, they would be here.

My friend and future alum,
the tree, would probably sit in
the back of the class in order to
not obscure anyone’s line of vi-
sion. Upon graduating, said tree
would return to his-or-her (what
sex is a tree?) its home, in a for-

est or nicely wooded area. Once '

home, it would spread the word
of the greatness that is W&L to
any shrub, bush or blade of grass
that would be willing to listen.
One day, an individual, let’s
name her Graciella, happens to
walk by wearing a lovely W&L
zip-up hoodie. The tree, in an

phobia about trees.

However, in the tree’s mind,
it shared a special instant with a
Dubyaneller. Surely, that young
woman must have understood
the bond that they share. Clear-
ly, W&L creates all sorts of great
people and plants. These people
go on to do various things in
their lives, such as running into
current students.

Not only are our alums plen-
tiful, but most of them are gener-
ous and enthusiastic about giving
current students opportunities.

Now I don’t know about you, ,

but I’m not much for having

connections and networks, but
I feel that after graduating from
here, I’ll be more connected then
Cingular/AT&T and more “in”
then Verizon.

It’s for this reason that ahnost
every time I travel, I wear'some-
thing with the school’s crest, let-
ters, etc. Just in case I run into
any alum, they already know
what school I attend as a result
of my luscious W&L parapher-
nalial

It’s even gotten to the point
where I believe that if extra-
terrestrial life were to be dis-
covered, we would soon ﬁnd
out they had W&L diplomas.
They would probably even be
c—school graduates; maybe busi-
ness or economics majors since
there seem to be a lot of them.

I Scientists say that if a nuclear
war occurred, only cockroaches
and Cher would survive. I am
now amending that statement to
include alums from our school.
If they can’t make it and come
out on top, nothing or no one
can: '

So here’s my point. As the
school year comes to an end, I
encourage everyone, especially
the seniors, to look back on the
year you’ve had and smile.

Congratulations, you’re one
step closer to being an all-pow-
erful W&L alum. Soon, you shall
join those elite ranks, amongst
great women, interesting men

and the occasionally exceptional

tree !

Mark of excellence

Treasure W&L for more than academic opportunities

By crlghton Allen
c o LU M N I s T

I would love a chance to end
the year on a positive note and
take stock, for just a second, of
the wonderful thing we all share
here at W&L.

I love that I can use the word
share there and not be trite. Be-
cause really, we all bear the mark
of a member of W&L.

Everything that happened this
year, good and ill, has all swirled
together inside each one of us
and left an indelible impression,
one that I am sure will make us
better people than the ones who
came here on September I.

I myself have just gone
"through my freshman year, and
what a year it has been! I have
learned more about myself than
I could have ever thought I had
left to ﬁnd out.

Along the way I met some
characters whose impact will
stay with me throughout the rest
of my life. Characters like Jeffer-
son Davis Futch III and Chuckie
Fleischmann who have made me

think and laugh, respectively,

more deeply than I have ever
known; if you have yet to. met
either of these men, I urge you in
the strongest terms to do so with
all possible haste. It will be well
worth your time.

There is a Facebook group
called “You Know you go to
W&L if...” It has a lot of funny
lines in it such as “You have at
least one ridiculous story from
Tear Night” or “You know your
way around town based on loca-
tion relative to Davidson Park,
Red Square, or Dominoes.”

Both of these may be, and quite
possibly are, very true, but I do
not think that they are what best
identiﬁes a W&L student.

No, what makes the time here
worth the while and most makes
a W&L student a W&L student
is the rich plethora of interac-
tions everyone is privileged to
enjoy every day with the people
of our school.

Before he was martyred in

sight of what makes this school
unique.

At the end of the day, a W&L
student may have a perfect GPA,
earn an All-ODAC First-Team
Award, and be president of every
club they join; all those things
are good and desirable, but they
don’t make a W&L student.

To “know you go to W&L”
takes much more than all these
things.

To know you go to W&L... takes knowing a

professor who inspires you to ﬁnd your life s

calling, ﬁnding a friend who will lay it all on

the line for you, and meeting a personable

security guard with whom you have profound

conversations at 2.'45a.m.

the third century, St. Lawrence
declared that the people of the
Church were its greatest trea-
sures, not the jewels in the trea-
sury.

Nowhere can these wise
words be more applicable than
right here.

This is a place where, all too

oﬁen, most of us, myself in-

cluded, spend far too much time
prizing our jewels rather ouritrue
treasures.

Whether it be up-striving
for a higher ranking in the US.
News & World Report or stu-

‘ dents burning themselves out for

a higher GPA, people here lose

It takes ‘knowing a professor
who inspires you to ﬁnd your
life’s calling, ﬁnding a friend
who will lay it all on the line for
you, discovering that one guy or
gal you just can’t get out of your
mind, and meeting a personable
security ofﬁcer with whom you
have profound conversations at
2:45 a.m.

The community we share
here is made by the people who
live together within a fabric of
honor knitted together by none
other than Robert Edward Lee.

How lucky we are to be the
great benefactors of his vision!
Let us then cast aside all ill will

that we may bear towards each
other for offences great and
small.

Wounds inﬂicted by things
like the bracket and list may take
a long time toheal, but nolone
does hirri or herself or W&L at
large any good by letting them
take control the school’s focus.

Instead, let us come together
in recognition of what we all
have going for us by being mem-
bers of a community with such
truly priceless treasures.

This year, and every. year,
we lose some of these treasures

-- the seniors -- in the form of -

graduation.

To them I tip my hat for a
job remarkably well done. It is
my sincerest hope that no matter
what they go on to do with their
lives, the treasures they have
found here remain to them as
bright as the day they were ﬁrst
discovered. _

In writing all this, I do not
mean to sound like an admis-
sions ofﬁce pledge whose task
it is to compose pamphlet-grade
literature—far from it.

But if you take a long min-
ute and think back on your time
here, I think that you will come
to agree with me.

When we all go our separate
ways this summer, let us not tell
others of our strife and discord
but rather of the people here who
have touched us.

Only by embracing and ap-
preciating them can we all here
at W&L come intolthe rich in-
heritance we were all meant to
share in together.

Top editor leaves, bids new editors to look deeper, hold leaders accountable

Bylacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

l’ve spent the last three years
chasing stories. It’s really as sim-
ple as that.

Some of the stories have been
a blast to write and report. Others
have left plenty of people pretty
mad at me.

The Staff Editorial I wrote on
May 12 was the latest in a long
line of bylines that have led to
angry e-mails.

I hope that the new crop of
editors will let me keep stirring
things up on occasion.

For now, however, it’s time
for me to let new writers and edi-
tors chase the stories that matter

at Washington and Lee. That-’s ’

why this issue will be my last as
Managing Editor.
l’ve been blessed to work

with many talented journalists
during my time at the Phi.

I was lucky to learn from
Emily Hulen and Kat Greene,
my two predecessors. Those
two have been some of my best

‘teachers at W&L, showing me

how to run a paper and chase a
story.

For the last I8 months, l’ve
enjoyed working with some of
the most talented editors this pa-
per has seen in a long time. Peo-
ple like Stacey Grijalva, Michael
Keenan and Jessica Shaw have
been the real heart of this paper,
making sure we have top notch
stories, columns and pictures
to put on the pages each week.
They’ve done most of the nitty—
gritty work in the last two years,
and I am deeply in their debt.

Jess served as the editor for
every single section before even-

tually ﬁnishing her term as the
Assistant Managing Editor. I
couldn’t have done this job with-
out her help and support.

Stacey has been an editor al-
most as long as I have, turning
the Opinions section into her

sports — to another level. Not
content with his pictures, we
turned him into the sports editor.
I can’t tell you how many par-
ents have called or e-mailed us
looking for pictures that Michael
took.

Board two weeks ago because I disklike the

members. I attacked the board because its se-

cret hearings endanger free speech.

If you’ve read my stories over
the past three years, you know
that I care deeply for W&L.
There are lots of stories — good
and bad ~ that needed to be told
on this campus.

l’ve been lucky enough to
interview men like Roger Mudd
and Jesse Jackson. I covered the
ﬁrst open hearing in 12 years and
a historic Mock Convention.

I also covered the drowning
of Charles Volpe two springs
ago. The stories l’ve written
abouthim, his family and the
Jordan’s Point Dam have been
some of the most difﬁcult ~ but
also most meaningful — articles
l’ve written.

The job of a campus newspa-
per is to shine the light on out-
standing students and faculty.
I hope we’ve done that every
week.

It’s also our job to hold those
in power — whether they’re stu-
dents or administrators - respon-
sible for their behavior and ac-
tions. .

My successors are free to take
the paper in whichever direction
they choose, but I hope they’ll
remember our mission statement
and strive to serve this commu-
nity with active and aggressive
reporting.

l’ve put in plenty of long
hours and late nights in the past
three years, and I’ll admit that
I’m excited about not having to
report to the ofﬁce every Sunday
afternoon.

Thank you for reading the Phi

munity a better place. It’s been a
pleasure working for you.

Hate speech proposal rewritten to explain restricted slurs

Other changes involve banning speech only on W&L facilities, deterring accidental and future violations

By John B. Martin
Joseph M. Yahr

We, the authors of this letter,
are writing to inform students,
faculty and staff of an updated
proposal to address serious con-
duct issues at Washington and
Lee University.

Mr. Martin, one of the au-
thors, submitted a proposal to
the Student Affairs Committee
at the beginning of this semester
to implement a policy to address
deeply harmful verbal conduct
known as hate speech.

The original proposal pro-
motes the adoption of a com-
plete prohibition of hate speech
among all members of the uni-
versity community; in the same
manner as current prohibitions
of harassment, assault and other
forms of misconduct.

This proposal, while already
sensitive to issues of speech,
process, and other policies, has
been supported by some but op-
posed among others.

The other author of this piece,
Mr. Yahr, was among those who
expressed his opposition to the
initial proposal by writing an
editorial in the Law News and
encouraging others to join him
in opposition.

One of us has felt that racist,
sexist, and homophobic slurs,
epithets, and other hate speech
ﬁnd virtually no protection un-
der the rubric of free speech and
are freely proscribable, at any
rate, because of the university’s
compelling need to prevent ha-
rassment, violence and the other
documented harms that hate
speech brings to our community.

The other has asserted that no
regulation of hate speech should
be permitted because it would
unduly burden the expression
of student and faculty views and
possibly duplicate an implied
prohibition of this conduct found
in existing policies.

Yet even as our disagreement
continued, nothing has been done
to bring about the diminution
and eventual end of hate speech
at W&L. This, we agree, will not
do. Given the considerable dis-
agreement this matter has engen-
dered, we recognize that neither
absolute view can provide a way
forward.

Therefore, we-put forth a new

proposal to address the continu- ,

ing and pervasive use of hate
speech in our community.

The proposal can be found
online at http://www.wluoutlaw.
blogspot.com/ (before continuing
further, we strongly recommend
that the reader view the proposal
in its entirety as reproduced on
the site). We offer our unquali-
ﬁed support to this proposal and
urge the SAC to adopt the same
immediately.

We now call all members of
our university together, includ-
ing those of opposing views, to
a resolution rooted in the truest
form of our institutional prin-
ciples.

Rather than detail every pro-
vision of the policy, which again
we urge the reader to do, we will
highlight some major changes
from the previously existing pro-
posal. The ﬁrst is the creation of
restrictions upon the place and
manner of the conduct at issue,
rather than a complete ban on

hate speech. The proposal for-
bids students, faculty and staff
to .write or utter hate speech in a
facility owned or operated by the
university. The provision arises
from the need of the university
to prevent harassment, violence,
declines in academic perfor-
mance, declines in on-campus
employment performance and
the diminution of the bonds of
trust that our community holds.
clear, all of which have been

are likely to face consistent deg-
radation, lowered academic per-
formance and emotional harm as
a condition of completing their
education.

At the same time, our re-
spect for the preservation of
free expression has caused us to
preserve the ability to use hate
speech among students outside
the bounds of university facili-
ties. Students, faculty, and staff
would be essentially free to use

The overall purpose is to conﬁne the reach of

the policy to the “worst of the worse ” of ver-

bal conduct which are also those mostly likely

to subtract from educational discource.

 

shown, through social science,
to be effects of hate speech.

The university’s interest in
preventing these effects is strong
at all times and places, but this
interest is undoubtedly at its
apex when the university seeks
to guarantee the safety, health
and well—being of students on
the properties that the univer-
sity controls and within which it
carries out its chief educational
mission.

Indeed, one would be hard
pressed to conclude that the uni-
versity can fulﬁll its guarantee of
non-discrimination on the basis
of race, gender, ethnicity or sex-
ual orientation if it effectively
requires its minority students to
enter into facilities in which they

slurs, epithets and clearly de-
rogatory words and phrases on
the basis of the listed categories
when they are not at school, even
in the presence of other members
of the university community.

Thus, even if the narrow
deﬁnitions and procedural safe-
guards in the proposal would
not otherwise exempt a student’s
conduct from the policy’s reach,
the student may still engage in
conduct constituting hate speech
as long as he or she does so on
non-university property.

Our respect for speech values
also explains the second major
aspect of the new proposal: a nar-
rower deﬁnition of hate speech.

Whereas some individuals
found the previous policy to lack

sufﬁcient boundaries to prevent
the capture of valuable expres-
sion, the new version has more
carefully delineated what con-
stitutes hate speech. The overall
purpose of these reﬁned deﬁni-
tions is to conﬁne the reach of
the policy to the “worst of the
worst” of verbal conduct, which
are also those most likely to
subtract from, inﬁnitely more
than they add to, educational
discourse and the civility of the
community. This ensures that the
policy contains a vast zone of
protection for free expression by
limiting the reach of the policy.
The ﬁnal major innovation of
the proposal is the ﬁne balance
of deterrence and process that it
provides invregards to violations
of the policy. Upon a student’s
second violation of the policy,
a conduct body may address the
student’s behavior as it sees ﬁt
to deter future violations by that
student and by other members of
the community. The notice issued
to students for an initial violation
also deters further misconduct by
shining a spotlight, so to speak,
on the continued and harmful in-
cidence of hate speech.
However, the policy also con-
tains more layers of procedural
protection for students than any
other university policy. A student
who has allegedly violated the
policy for the ﬁrst time would re-
ceive only anotice of the report-
ed violation and the chance to
contest the notibe and the report
of the violation, including the op-
portunity for a full hearing. Even
if the notice still stands after
the hearing, the student cannot
face any consequences from a

conduct body. Furthermore, any
student, faculty or staff member
can argue that their conduct does
not fall within the policy’s deﬁ-
nition of hate speech because the
language used has a reasonable,
non-derogatory meaning.

Finally, the proposal urges
conduct bodies and decision-
makers to consider various cir-
cumstances surrounding an in-
cident in determining whether
an individual has violated the
policy. The goal of these proce-
dural protections is to guarantee
fair treatment for all involved.

We wish to conclude by
drawing attention to the connec-
tion between the new proposal
and our institutional values. The
proposal allows for a vigorous
educational environment of open
debate, and it also creates a com-
munity deﬁned by civility, trust
and honor.

Hate speech is inherently dis-
honorable, and it breaks down
the bonds of trust and civility.

While some may believe that
it is essential to the expression
of their views, the most severe
forms of hate speech prevent
others from participating in any
meaningful dialogue, whether
civil or otherwise. The univer-
sity environment upon which we
pride ourselves cannot endure
long under the inﬂuence of such
behavior..

We ask the SAC to pass this
policy, set an effective date for
the policy and begin a large scale
educational program to inform
students about the policy and the
issues surrounding it to begin no
less than one month prior to the
policy’s effective date.

Student government, not SF HB, should decide conduct cases

Also, W&L has done more than enough to encourage, protect women; fears of aggressive drunks not limited to Lex«

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to
an editorial by Catherine Kruse
in last week’s Ring-Tum Phi.
Though the Phi has always rep-
resented some extreme view-
points, I found Catherine Kruse’s
editorial particularly ridiculous.
In her piece, “Make honor into a
lifestyle,” Ms. Kruse argues that
W&L “does not treat its women
well enough to be considered
average [in comparison to other
college campuses].” Kruse goes
on to explain that the recent
complaints against the Student
Faculty Hearing Board’s “Tri-
dent Bracket” trial are complete-
ly unsound because “very few of

us know anything about that [the
SFHB]. . .” Maybe it’s Ms. Kruse
who doesn’t know anything
about student government.

The complaints that Kruse
dismisses regard the SFHB’s
ability to prosecute students in
secret tribunals on ﬂimsy charg-
es ﬁled by anonymous plaintiffs
who aren’t even required to tes-
tify even in such cases where the
verdict could mean expulsion for
the accused.

Perhaps Kruse, a freshman,
is unaware that thissort of thing
used to be considered an assault
on traditional W&L student gov-
ernment. That a secret panel of
appointed faculty members and
indirectly elected students can

expel W&L students on “conduct
unbecoming of a gentleman”
is an abomination. Such cases

that constitutes “conduct unbe-
coming...” In my opinion we
didn’t even need the politically

The university has a number of judicial bodies

whose sole purpose is the protection of W&L

women. How can one conclude that W&L does

not treat its women well enough to be considered

average?

 

should be heard by the directly
elected, student—run Executive
Committee who already has the
power to expel students convict-
ed of sexual assault/harassment

motivated sexual assault addi-
tion to the White Book.

Besides the fact that W&L
has a female athletic director, a
female dean of students (who’s

also now “vice president for stu-
dent affairs”), as well as numer-
ous women in various positions
of power, women make up 51
percent of the undergraduate stu-
dent body. The university has a
number of extracurricular activi-
ties and judicial bodies whose
sole purpose is the protection of
W&L women. How can one con-
clude that W&L “does not treat
its women well enough to be
considered average”?

Regarding the rest of Kruse’s
remarks about how W&L wom-
en “have to watch their backs”
from aggressive drunks, how is
that any different from anywhere
else on this planet? Lexington
being an earthly, imperfect place,

there will always be unfortunate,
unacceptable things that hap-
pen when bad people drink too
much. That’s why we have a jus-
tice system.

Maybe something Kruse
should consider is that W&L men
also live in fear of their black-out
drunken coeds. Sometimes a girl
will arrive at a fraternity party
ﬂagrantly intoxicated, proceed to
vomit all over the place, pass out
in a place of residence, and then
wake up in the morning wildly
throwing around malicious accu-

‘sations. To borrow Ms. Kruse’s,

words, “it happens more often
than anyone will admit.”

KEVIN REMINGTON FOR W&L

-Cast of Little Shop of A Horrors shines in a disturbingly hilarious performance

By Celeste Cruz-carandang
STA F F W R I T E R

Washington and Lee theater
put on a glittering performance of
Little Shop of Horrors last Thurs-
day evening, followed by three
more shows.

Full of unexpected and clever
twists, Little Shop delivered all
the “Murder, intrigue, glamour
and fame” it promised.

The entire program was an im-
pressive example of elegant act-
ing, energetic choreography and
ﬂawless voices, with a technical
crew that rivals the most experi-
enced of backstage staffs. Even
under the pressure of opening
night, the cast of Little Shop put
together an exciting and moving
performance.

The performance consisted of
ﬁfteen musical numbers. A band,
led by Josh Harvey, accompanied
the cast. These songs told the
dynamic story of Seymour Krel-
born.

While working in Mushnik’s
Flower Shop, Krelbom, an awk-
ward and shy orphan, cultivates
another plant species. Krelbom
ﬁnds out that his new plant, has
a dangerous penchant for human
ﬂesh. Ironically, he names the
plant after his co-worker and se-
cret crush, Audrey.

Audrey II, puppeteered by

Tim Kirby and with the voice of
Markheavens Tshuma, tempts
Krelbom into feeding it murdered
bodies. Orin Scrivello, Audrey’s
dangerous dentist boyfriend, was
the ﬁrst of Audrey II’s and Krel-
bom’s victims. Mr. Mushnik, and
Audrey follow Scrivello soon af-
ter. It was not until the death of
the woman he loved that Krelbom
fully realizes the gravity of his ac-
tions and the depth of his greed.
Under the direction of Profes-
sor Kimberly Jew and the musical
direction of Josh Harvey and Pro-
fessor Jerry Myers, the musical
went beyond the ﬂashy numbers
and cheery dance sequences char-
acteristic of Broadway musicals.
Instead, the cast and company
performed the rock numbers with
a deﬁnite edge and unique ﬂair.
Johnny Coyle, as always, de-
livered a poignant and clever per-
formance as Seymour Krelbom.
The perfect blend of sweetness,
shyness and quirkiness, Coyle
portrayed a lovable character put

‘under the worst of circumstances.

Coyle made an interesting
choice in conveying the transfor-
mation of his character. Rather
than portraying Krelbom as a
good man turning into an avari-
cious monster, Coyle allowed the
reticence and confusion of his
character to shine through. His
voice, although not as strong as

some of his fellow actors, capti-
vated the audience with its genu-
ine emotion.

Nicole Conkling played Au-
drey, Seymour’s na'1've yet big-
hearted crush. Her portrayal of
the female lead went beyond the
superﬁcial characteristics of her
character.

Like Coyle, Conkling gave
Audrey more depth then some of
the songs allowed her. Conkling’s
ﬂawless soprano transformed the
character from an irrational ﬂake
to a woman whose dreams have
been stolen by the dangers of
Skid Row.

Mr. Mushnik, played by Rob
Mish, was a surprisingly dynamic
character. Thanks to the wit and
ﬁnesse of Mish, Mushnik was a
villain the audience could love.
At times, Mish made the ﬂower
shop owner to be almost father-
ly. In other numbers, Mushnik
became a scheming tyrant. Yet.
Mish made sure to always deliver
a solid and extraordinary perfor-
mance.

Matt Amling lent his voice to
the slightly sadistic Orin Scriv-
ello. His rendition of “Dentist!”
was both fun and disturbing.
Indeed, his entire performance
maintained this.alarming balance.
While his voice was idyllic and
almost angelic, his performance
successfully conveyed an evil and

mysonginistic ﬁgure.

The members of the Trio, Kim-
ber Wiggs, Marquita Robinson,
and A’rese Emokpae lent their
strong voices to the background
and narration of the show.

While their voices were strong
and blended well, the chaos ofthe
ﬁrst performance may have taken
some toll on their choreography.
Although obviously talented, their
dancing was not always synchro-
nized. Despite some differences

  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 

with the choreography, the Trio
delivered a strong, performance.
They did not only hchieve coher-
ence as a group, but were also
able to create individual charac-
ters.

Finally, Audrey II was the
voice of temptation. Both Kirby
and Tshuma created a true charac-
ter from a puppet. Sassy, dark and
hungry, Audrey II came alive with
the skills of both of these talented

young men.

The cast and crew of Little
Shop of Horrors performed a
stunning rendition of the classic
Broadway hit. Although hindered
by a few difﬁculties, the majority
of which may be attributed to the
jitters of opening night, the audi-

, ence was both moved and excited

by the performance. With all the
hard work of the actors and stage
crew, they all deserved a standing
ovation.

J ammin’ at the Creek  

 

MORGAN HARRIS / saff hotographer

Outdoors at Zo|lman’s Pavilion, Buffalo Creek attendees dance and groove to the tunes of the bands. Bands
played on Friday evening and all day on Saturday. Students and Lexington residents came and went throughout
the weekend, some choosing to camp on the grounds.

Crowds relax to music and more at Buﬂalo Creek

By Eric Hamscher
STAFF WRITER

This past weekend at Buﬁialo Creek
served as the ﬁnal opportunity for Washing-
ton and Lee students to forget about school.

In the midst of blaring music, the Creek
reminded visitors that W&L continues to
fulﬁll its renowned ‘work hard, play hard’
mentality.

Buffalo Creek Music Festival is held an-
nually at Zollman’s Pavilion.

The barn was jam-packed for perfor-
mances by The Bridge, the Hackensaw
Boys, BlueGround UnderGrass, Outfor-
mation, Big Sam’s Funky Nation, Nathan
Moore, the Benevento Russo Duo, Gary
Ruley and Mule Train, and Farm Vegas.

Judging by the rest of the activities going
on, some people probably did not even real-
ize there were bands.

Outside, a mix of out-of-towners and stu-
dents enjoyed each other’s company around
over a dozen bonﬁres. Others stumbled
across the open ﬁelds, obviously in search
of better company.

People migrated from camp to camp, try-
ing to take in the best of what Buffalo Creek
had to offer. Many tried new things and had
unprecedented experiences in an environ-
ment like the Country, multiplied by ten.

By the end of Friday night, most every-
one had found what they were looking for.
Many had collapsed in a tent, on top of an
Audi, or even in the ﬁelds ~ seeing stars be-
fore waking up Saturday for two more days
of the weekend’s events.

One W&L student, sophomore Jamie
Goodin, described the festivities as “total
freedom that made for a weekend where
everyone could run around having a great
time.”

And total freedom it was in a secluded
country location where Lexington police ﬁ-
nally seemed to be absent from busting up
the fun.

Campus security officer Baner did an ex-
cellent job insuring that any and all pitbulls
were banned from entrance to the Creek.

The only likely victims from this spring’s
festivities were brain cells — but not enough

to keep most rising seniors from acing the
LSAT. Overall, the event was a great way
for graduating seniors to begin wrapping up
their ﬁnal year at W&L until later returning
to parties as respected alums.

Late Saturday night, for those too worn
out to spend another night camping out at
the Creek, students crowded the street en-
trance in high hopes of boarding Traveller.

For an event as important as Buffalo
Creek, W&L stepped it up to provide stu-
dents with coach buses back to the Quad.
Although many of the drivers were less than
thrilled about Buffalo Creek, they were able
to get most students back to campus by ear-
ly Sunday morning.

Unfortunately, there are always those
few stragglers who get left behind. They are
either not yet accustomed to the Darwinist
mentality of Traveller lines or they just were
not in the right mentality to ﬁnd the bus. Ei-
ther way, some got home and some did not.

Nevertheless, next year’s festival will
hopefully deliver as much craziness and ex-
citement as this year’s.

Barbacoa promises ﬂavor

Caribbean Society to host barbecue with island ﬂair

By John Henderson
sun warren

Ever eaten fried plantains, done the limbo
and performed Bob Marley music all in one
day? Probably not, unless you have already
been to the Caribbean Society’s “Barba-
coa.”

The barbacoa is an event of food, games
and music taking place at Cannan Green
from 4:30 to 7:30 this afternoon. It is free
and open to the public, but the newly formed
Caribbean Society hopes to raise money for
future events with donations. A

Barbacoa was brought to the United
States and became barbeque It is tradition-
ally spicy meat cooked over an open ﬁre.
The Caribbean Society will offer a taste of
jerk chicken, curried shrimp, and meat pies,
as well as fried plantains, sweet potato balls
and ice cream.

There will also be karaoke, cards, domi-
noes, hula hoops and of course, the limbo.
Prizes are being awarded to the best singer
and winner of the most games.

The Caribbean Society was formed this
year by sophomore Kristen-Kaye Goul-
boume and junior Tabitha King. Goul-
boume, who is from Jamaica, wanted to
raise awareness of a part of the world that is
often overlooked or misrepresented.

“I want people to think beyond entertain-
ment and beaches,” she said, adding that
Jamaica and the United States have always
had close political ties. “There is a saying:
if the United States sneezes, Jamaica catches
a cold.”

“The ﬁrst step is to let people know that

the Caribbean is there,” said sophomore and
club secretary Yasmine Espert.

This year, the Caribbean Society raised
money for an orphanage in Barbados at
the Calypso dinner in February and held a
book drive for Caribbean school children in
April.

The Caribbean Society holds regular
meetings and encourages W&L students of
any background to attend.

discussing its politics. Keeling believes Ca-
ribbean ecology has great potential in the
pharmaceutical industry—of the 200 most
commonly used drugs derived from plants,
127 of them grow in Jamaica.

“Jamaica is an extremely rich land,” he
said, citing a study by the Nature Conservan-
cy that showed Jamaica, Cuba and Hispan-
iola to have the highest biodiversity in the
western hemisphere.

“I want people to think beyond entertainment and beaches...

there is a saying: if the United States sneezes, Jamaica

catches a cold ”

The Program in Latin American and
Caribbean Studies, W&L’s newest inter-
disciplinary program, is helping to bring
historical, political and cultural ideas from
the Caribbean to this campus. This spring,
LACS Professors Carey, DeLaney, Dickov-
ick and Eastwood are leading students on a
four-week trip to Barbados and St. Vincent
to study slavery and race relations.

Alumnus David Keeling ’73 is an artist,
writer and Jamaican citizen who comes back
to Lexington once a year to renew his visa.
Keeling is enthusiastic that the W&L com-
munity is taking notice of the Caribbean.

“I like the idea very much because it
builds friendship, it builds understanding,”
he said.

Keeling studied history at W&L and now
enjoys writing about Caribbean history and

Still, there are a great many problems that
the Caribbean nations need to overcome to
move forward, Keeling said. Crime, heavy
drug trafﬁcking, political corruption, vio-
lence and a lack of education are some of the
biggest.

Keeling believes it will take integrity on
the part of Caribbean leaders and economic
development to ﬁx these problems. With
the development of CARICOM, a free trade
zone in the Caribbean, the islands of the Ca-
ribbean will have a chance to do that.

Goulboume and other Caribbean Society
members hope to bring these issues to light
as their club is established. For now, they of-
fer the W&L community music, games, and
a “taste of the Caribbean.”

Shaw and Doornbos place at N CA/ls, break school records

By Kevin Corn
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee women’s track
and ﬁeld team had an outstanding showing
with only two competitors at the Division
III NCAA Championships this past week-
end at the University of Wisconsin Osh-
kosh.

With top 5 ﬁnishes from both juniors
Jess Shaw and Stacy Doombos, the ladies
posted personal bests and even school re-
cords.

In the women’s heptathlon, Doombos
ﬁnished in a stunning third place with a
grand total of 4737 points, less than 400
points behind the winner, a senior from
Messiah College.

On the ﬁrst day, Doombos started off
well with a 15.18 in the 100 meter hur-
dles, tying the school record. In the high
jump, she leapt to a height of 5’2.50” while
throwing a personal record of 33’3.25” in
the shot put. In the last event of the ﬁrst
day, Doornbosmaintained her excellence
by running a time of 25.60 in the 200 meter
dash. ‘

Doombos continued towards her third
place ﬁnish with excellent performances
on the second day, as well. In the long
jump, Doombos leapt l7’4.75” and then
threw the javelin 87’3”. In the last event of
the heptathlon, the 800 meter race, Doom-
bos ran a time of 2:24. 1 6 to secure her third
place ﬁnish.

Doombos’ ﬁnish qualiﬁed her for All-
American Honors as well as a school re-
cord in the heptathlon with her point total.

Shaw competed in the 5,000 meter race
Saturday. Entering the event in 11"‘ place,

Shaw ran a fantastic race to overtake sever-
al runners. With a time of 16:56.78, Shaw
took 5"‘ place, as well as blowing away a
twelve-year-old school record set by Jose-
phine Schaeffer in 1996. Schaeffer’s record
was 17:46.04, meaning Shaw blew it away
by a full ﬁfty seconds.

The Generals wrapped up their season,
and what a season it has been. Countless
records have been broken — from a swim-
mer who decided to run track this year and

broke the 5K record to new school records
in javelin, hammer throw and more. The
track teams have also built up their stand-
ing in the ODACs with a second place ﬁn-
ish from the women and a third place ﬁnish
from the men. Overall, the season has been
very positive for the teams and hints of still
greater prospects in future years.

finished third in the heptathlon.

Graduating Keenan bids farewell  

Michael Keenan looks back at his time as the Phi is sports editor

By Michael Keenan
sPoRrs armor:

It was just a simple request for a few

,pictures. The sports editor of the school

paper asked to use a few shots I had taken
at a cross country meet. I never thought it
would turn into this. Now, almost 50,000
clicks on the camera, 50 articles written
and countless articles assigned as sports
editor later, my dive into journalism has
come to an end.

Division 111 sports offers a unique atmo-
sphere where everyone — coaches, athletes,
fans ~ are involved because they love the
game. College sports provide a palpable
urgency not found in professional sports,
and even more so in Division III. Most D-
I players are going pro in something other
than sports, and this is even more true of
D-III athletes. For most of us, this is our
last chance to compete. For most of us, it
doesn’t matter if we study tonight or to-
morrow night, but if we don’t bring it AND
leave it on the ﬁeld on game day, we’ve
missed our chance. Sports give the four
years of college a here-and-now adrenaline
rush not found in the lecture halls.

Even athletes who know they’re going
pro know there’s something special about
college sports that they can never reclaim.
In a recent interview, Larry Bird said

Magic Johnson beating him in college hurt
more than in the pros and that he’d trade an
NBA championship for a college title. On
the surface, it appears crazy that someone
would give up an NBA championship, the
sign of being on the best team in the world,
for a college title. Yet he still wishes for the
NCAA championship.

One of the perks of taking pictures is
getting the best seats in the house to see that

atmosphere up close ~ for free. I’ve been
run over by Chris McHugh and soaked by
numerous steeplechasers clearing the wa-
ter jump. I ’ve had front row seats to the
revitalization of the football and basketball
teams. I can remember second halves of
football games and the entirety of basket-
ball games where I might be the only one
there. This year, the bleachers stayed full

and, on a few occasions, I could feel the
ﬂoor or the Warner Center tremble. While
W&L hasn’t quite blossomed into a foun-
tain gushing with school spirit, the water’s
been turned on.

Through a camera lens, I’ve seen some
pretty cool events. John Christopher fall-
ing on his back at the ﬁnal horn, exhausted
from grappling with Ursinus’ Matt Wil-
liams but shaking his ﬁsts because his 6-5
victory snapped Ursinus’ 27—match confer-
ence winning streak. I was on the sidelines

when the football team went to the national .

playoffs. Granted, we got beat like the
play-in game winner in the NCAA tour-
nament, but we were still there. I watched
from behind the bench when the team went
on fourth down and one with a minute left
in the ﬁnal game at old Wilson Stadium
against Bridgewater — and got it to run
out the clock. I saw Jessica Shaw, just two
weeks removed from the swim season, run
her ﬁrst collegiate 5,000m at the ODAC
indoor championships and lap the entire
ﬁeld — twice. I've even seen Burr Datz get
kicked out of a basketball game for yelling

at the refs when he thought the fouls were

getting out of hand.

To all the athletes, coaches, teammates
and fans who have made my time cover-
ing W&L sports so special, thanks for the
memories.
