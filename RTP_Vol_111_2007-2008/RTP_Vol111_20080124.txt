emocratic Mock  
Convention  

After three years of preparation, countless hours of research and untold amounts of booze,
it all comes down to this: Barack Obama vs. Hillary Clinton. In a year when students

are celebrating the centennial convention, it seems appropriate that the gathering faces

its most difﬁcult decision in years. Before the convention gets down to the business of
selecting the Democratic nominee, some of the biggest names in Democratic politics will
take the stage to stump for their candidates. ‘Va. Gov. Tim Kaine, who speaks ﬁrst on Fri-
day, was one of Obama’s earliest supporters, while Geraldine Ferraro, the ﬁrst woman to
appear on a major party’s ticket, is a strong supporter of Clinton. The most exciting part
of the convention may c_ome decades later, when Beau Biden, Harold Ford, Jr. or Patrick
Rose run for President. That’s one of the legacies of the convention’s ﬁrst 100 years: ﬁnd-
ing risingistars like Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter and introducing them to America years
before anyone else knows who they are. The other legacypis accuracy: W&L‘students
have been right 18 out of 23 times and have only been wrong once since 1948. Will that

legacy continue? Clinton or Obama hope it do.es.

Delegations log long hours behind scenes

State chairs, student leaders sacriﬁce time to research, fundraise and design

By Allison Chopin
STAFF WRITER

Mounting excitement sur-
rounding the centennial anniver-
sary of the Mock Convention have
students anxiously awaiting the
myriad events planned for them
- the parties, distinguished speak-
ers, parade and ﬁnal outcome.
However, not all have taken time

, to notice how hard their state del-

egations have worked in the past
months.

Each state delegation has pro-
vided numerous opportunities for
its members to participate.

The state chairs were selected
over a year ago through a rigorous
application process. Each chair
has to oversee political research,
help plan the parade ﬂoat and get
its delegation ready for the con-

vention.

When students joined delega-
tions in September, some chose to
take on other leadership positions.

The'vice chair serves as an as-
sistant to the other positions, and

'the treasurer manages ﬁnances,

such as donations made to the del-
egation. *

Some delegations may have a
ﬂoat chair in charge of supplies,
designs and construction of the
state’s parade ﬂoat. L

Aside from these typical posi-
tions, the student who takes the
job of research chair must conduct

business that is particular to each '

state.

“The research chair is responsi-
ble for making contacts within the
state to communicate with about
the‘ election and for preparing the
various reports required of each

state,” said senior Kate Chiasson,
the chair for Wisconsin.

Both the research chair and
state chair may be responsible for
contacting state politicians if nec-
essary.

“The majority of
the delegates have
been helping with
making the ﬂoat. ”

KATE CHIASSON,
Wisconsin state chalr

“[In Wisconsin] the research
chair is the most involved,” Chias-
son said. -

A All delegates were asked to be

involved in the act of fundraising.

Each member provided the
names and addresses of ﬁve con-
tacts, such as friends and family,
who might be interested in donat-
ing to the student’s delegations

The students who do not as-
sume leadership roles can become

. involved in the areas of T-shirt and

ﬂoat design, among other things.

“Since we don’t have a ﬂoat
chair, the majority of delegates
have been helping with making
the ﬂoat,” said Chiasson.

The time commitment may be
small for average Mock Conven-
tion participants, but the delega-
tions still require their contribu-
tion and commitment.

“Delegates can choose to be as
involved or not involved as they
wish, but they can expect to go to a
meeting or two and help out when
it is asked for,” Chiasson said.

Virginia, however, extends far be-
yond his current position. As a cru-
cial member of the state legislature
from 1982 to 1996, Manchin helped
ﬁx West Virginia’s workers’ compen-
sation system. He also instituted in-
surance reforms, established the ﬁrst
comprehensive teacher pay package
‘in more than 15 years, decreased the
state’s debt, strengthened ethics laws
and reduced the food tax. As secre-
tary of state from 2000 to 2004, Man-
chin pushed the SHARES program,
which promoted democracy to all
schoolchildren and registered 42,000

The first and only African—Ameri-
can woman elected to the Senate,
former Illinois Senator Carol Mose-
ley Braun is most well known for her
candidacy for the Democratic Party
nomination in the 2004 presidential
election. However, she dropped out of
the race days before the Iowa caucus,
deciding instead to support Howard

of the Woman.”

She gained political experience
when serving as a prosecutor in the
U.S. Attorney’s office in 1973, work-
ing in housing, health and environ-
ment. She later won the Attorney Gen—
eral’s Special Achievement Award.

The year after she left the U.S.
Attomey’s office, she won a seat in
the Illinois House of Representa-
tives, focusing on governmental re-
form, education and civil rights. She
angrily ran for a seat in the Senate
when the incumbent voted in 1991 to
confirm Clarence Thomas for the Su-
preme Court. For her ﬁrst six years in
the senate, she was the only African-
American. She has spoken out against
the death penalty, against removing
Saddam Hussein, for abortion rights
and gun control and voted for gay
marriage recognition.

Recently, Braun was in the public
eye again when she resisted a mugger
tried to steal her purse. She has also
made headlines for her organic food
line called Ambassador Organics.

Braun will speak in the convention
late Friday night.

Tracking down the speakers

With some dzﬁiculty, W&L receives top-notch
speakers for this year 3 Mock Convention.

By Queenie Wong
srnrr wmrsn

For the last two years, the Speakers
Committee has worked hard to bring
prominent political leaders to this
weekend’s Mock Convention.

With twelve speakers booked,
Speakers Chair Logan Gibson said
that she’s excited about the upcoming
event.

“I don’t think Mock Convention
has ever had such a strong lineup,”
said Gibson.

This year’s speakers include Vir-
ginia Governor Timothy M. Kaine,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, former Texas
Rep. Charles Wilson, Chairman of the
Democratic Leadership Council Har-
old Ford Jr., as well as other speakers
the committee believes will become
more politically inﬂuential in the fu-
hue

Although students were hoping
that one of the three main contenders
for the democratic nomination would
make an appearance at the event, the
South Carolina primary this Saturday
made it unlikely that Hilary Clin-
ton, Barack Obama or John Edwards
would come.

“The front-loaded primary season
made it difﬁcult for us to get top notch
speakers, because so many speakers
are stumping for the candidates,” said
Advisory Board Liaison Bill Larson.

Gibson also pointed out that the
Virginia primary isn’t until Feb. 12.
The candidates don’t have much of
an incentive to come down to the uni-
versity, she said. Timing was probably
the most difﬁcult obstacle the com-
mittee faced.

The Speakers Committee includes
nine other students—Natalie Murphy,
Richard Cleary, Taylor Lawch, Hunt-
er Branstetter, Laura Secrest, Dylan
Merrill, Chris Martin, Alex Utsey
and Weston Jones. Gibson assigned
each member about ﬁve speakers to
research and the committee reported
back on their progress weekly. Each
member contributed about four to five
hours per week, cultivating contacts
and trying to book speakers for the
event.

Gibson said the committee used
about two-thirds of its budget, but
would not specify the budget amount.

In 2004, the Mock Convention
raised over $450,000. General Chair-
man Richard Friedman said that this
year’s budget exceeded the amount of
the last event. He, too, would not re-
lease any exact ﬁgures.

In previous Mock Conventions, the
Speakers Committee had a knack for
choosing speakers, who had promis-
ing futures in politics—-Jimmy Carter
in 1972 and Bill Clinton in 1988, just
to name a few.

Gibson said that selecting speak-
ers did involve a lot of insight into the
speakers’ futures, but that the com-
mittee also wanted to target Virginian
leaders.

Gibson praised the committee’s se-
lection of U.S. Sen. Jim Webb as the
keynote speaker.

“He’s a very pivotal figure on the
national scene right now and having
him come to Lexington for this event
is huge,” she said.

night for Mock Con. Jackson participat-
ed in the famous Selma to Montgomery
marches in 1965 that were organized by
Martin Luther King, Jr. Two decades
later, Jackson tried to become the ﬁrst

black president in 1984 and again in
1988 and is returning to one of the six
states in which he won the Democratic
primary.

He has travelled the world and
met with American adversaries Hugo
Chavez, Syrian President Bashar Assad,
Fidel Castro and former Yugoslavian
President Slobodan Milosevic. He’s
argued for the release of American pris-
oners abroad, peace in the Middle East,
the end of apartheid and against the war
in Iraq. He also served as U.S. special
envoy to Kenya in 1997. In 2000 Bill
Clinton gave Jackson the highest award
possible for a civilian, the Presidential
Medal of Freedom, for his political ac-
tivism. -

Jackson has thrown himself into nu-
merous recent issues, including Terri
Shiavo (the Florida woman with brain
damage), the Duke lacrosse scandal
and Michael Richard’s (Kramer from
Seinfeld) racist outburst.

Jackson has already publicly an-
nounced his support of Barack Obama,
who has spoken on Jackson’s radio
show.

Only in America does the
toughest job have the most
absurd hiring process.

The primary and caucus
system used by political par-
ties to pick their presidential
candidates is outdated, un-
fair and utterly ridiculous.
Americans are beginning to
notice that in order to avoid
another painfully early and
dragged-out campaign sea-
son in four years, the rules
of the game need to be re-
written.

A start would be to turn
the caucuses into actual pri-
maries. To those of us who
do not live in one of the 17
states that holds a caucus,
voting in private seems like
a natural right. Not so in the
caucus system where you
have to publicly state your
preference and make an ar-
gument for your candidate
to convince others. Nor do
you have all day to vote like
you do with regular prima-
ries. Instead you have a set
meeting time and place, and
if you cannot be there then
you obviously don’t matter
enough to have a say.

That means soldiers,
on—duty police ofﬁcers and
ﬁremen, the ill and anyone
unfortunate enough not to
be able to control their work
schedule don’t get a vote.
Do these people not deserve
the right to vote?

Then, debunk the myth
that small states have a di-
vine right to vote ﬁrst and
essentially decide each par-
ty’s candidate. Regardless
of how different they are
from each other, Iowa and
New Hampshire are not
representative of the
nation as a whole.

According to
the Census Bu-
reau, they con-
tain less than
2 percent
of the
total
U.S.

  

  
   
    

CON Primary overhaul

Presidential candidates we can live with? Someday

population. While the na-
tion’s population is over a
quarter minority, minorities
comprise less than 10 per-
cent of Iowa and less than 5
percent of New Hampshire.

The number of voters in
Iowa is so small that, by the
end of caucus night, more
Republicans voted via ab-
sentee ballot in Florida than
took part in the caucuses in
Iowa. Yet, if one candidate
wins both states, he or she
is essentially crowned the
nominee. You can certainly
lose the nomination if you
lose in the ﬁrst two states -
—just ask John Edwards and
Rudy Giuliani in a couple of
months.

The solution is to hold
every primary on the same
day, a “Super-Duper” Tues-
day of sorts. If we hold our
general election on the same
date throughout the country,
why not the primaries?

The last step to ﬁxing the
primary system would en-
sure that radical candidates
on both sides do not have
an unfair advantage. By
appealing to party bases,
those considered very
liberal or very conser-
vative usually have
the advantage in

primaries.

states you

you are registered with a par-
ty. This could lead to some-
one without general support
gaining a party nomination.
Other states, though, allow
independents to vote in one
of the two party primaries.
This ensures centrists a fair
shot and helps the parties by
giving them a more electable
candidate in the election.

Registering with a party
should be a sign of support,
not the only way one gets
to vote. Thus, every state
should allow independents

New Hampshire and Iowa
have yet to lead as wrong

By Scott centorlno
STAFF WRITER

Our mother ducks: Iowa and New Hampshire.
When a group of ducklings crosses the street, a mother duck leads it to
safety. We know that without that mother duck, all the ducklings would confus-
ingly scatter in different directions with no guidance, no sense of judgment and
no experience of safe-crossing. The same is true of our presidential primary system,
speciﬁcally of the early, small states such as Iowa and New Hampshire.

Is very Sum‘ While neither Iowa nor New Hampshire have the population or power to normally
The changes be considered mother ducks in politics, both states have a ﬁne record and experience in
would have showing other duckling states the right way to cross.

to be First off, let’s dispel the theory that these two states have all the power. They do not. It is
glad: South Carolina, not Iowa or New Hampshire, that can say its Republican winner has gone on

to win the GOP nomination every election since 1980. Bill Clinton didn’t win in Iowa or New
Hampshire but found his way to the White House.

Both Iowa and New Hampshire have a long and storied tradition of independent, responsible citi-
zenship above any inﬂuence of national media or outside inﬂuence. ‘

Almost every Democrat and most Republicans would agree that, in hindsight, John McCain probably
would have been the better Republican nominee in 2000. New Hampshire thought so, too. Despite superior
organization and name recognition, two features that would dominate a national primary, New Hampshire’s
brand of door-to-door, retail politics allowed its voters to make a more informed decision.

As someone who has seen presidential candidates during this election in both Iowa and New Hampshire, 1 can

say with certainty how superior voters’ decision-making is given the chance to personally host a candidate in your
home and have a chat.

That is what politics truly is. That is true democracy. It’s up-close. It’s real. Voters don’t form opinions based on televi-
sion commercials. That would simply empower those with money and leave lifeless those without the necessary funds to
voice their message, antithetical to democratic principles.

The ultimate test of a candidate should not be how effectively he can saturate media markets with sappy images of himself.
The true testament to a statesman is his ability to get out there, meet people, connect with regular Americans, make a direct impact
on voter beliefs and step outside plush D.C. ofﬁces.

I want my leader to know me, to know my family, to be able say he’s met me. In that spirit, this nation has gained its strength. I
want to know that he’s been to my town and seen the local problems. '

The counterargument to this, of course, is that the candidate won’t have time to meet every voter in the nation. So, in order to be fair,

we should make it a national primary. That is simply selﬁsh, irresponsible, and ignorant of history. It is the equivalent of a 4-year-old saying
of a classmate, “Timmy has a toy car and I don’t,” and then yelling at the teacher about Timmy’s toy car until the teacher takes it away.

This alternative is a Stalinist nightmare where you only elect people from a distance. No system will achieve perfection, and I am not claim-

ing our current system has. Iowa and New Hampshire do not represent America as a whole, but only in that they think independently, unlike
states which have no tradition of doing so.
How much does a New Hampshire voter have in common with a New Mexico voter? Probably not a great deal. But that New Mexico voter can

still trust New Hampshire voters to make the right choice because of proximity to the candidates and unique perspective and ability to make judg-
ment.
Candidates have been effectively judged by Iowans and New Hampshirites in the past because both groups understand the importance of their decision
and take it seriously. Perhaps considering their shining track records, we should put more emphasis on the two states.
So, I salute you Iowa and New Hampshire. I recognize the work you’ve done for yourselves and for this nation. I wish you the best in thwarting threats from
childish states jealous of your position. And, I hope that for many years to come, presidential candidates will still have to speak on the farms and in the Veterans
of Foreign Wars halls all across your two states.
Your mother duck wisdom has yet to fail us.

Hillary Clinton should not be
the Democratic Party’s nominee.
Period.

For any liberal who actually
wants to see a Democrat in the
Oval come Jan. 21, 2009, the
reasons why should be like a
well-known litany by now.

When I told my editors I
wanted to write an anti-Hillary
piece, they immediately told me
that I better have good reasons.
I needed something more than
“she’s a bitch.” (Writer’s Note —
Can I write that? If you are read-
ing this sentence, dear friend, I
suppose so.)

Now, let’s all be big boys and
girls about this and quit being
ridiculous. The hyperbolic lan-
guage and emotion that Clinton
inspires is downright silly.

I sincerely doubt that very
many people will be moving
to Canada if Senator Clinton is

- electedpresident. Perhaps Pro-

fessor Beckley or Brown will
correct me, but I don’t believe

Hillary Clinton is the ﬁrst horse— 0

man of the apocalypse.
(Although, on a side note,

if Senator Clinton» is to win the

general election, and if we must

  Avoiding the shame: No, Clinton

all ﬂee the country, why in all of

God’s earth are we picking Can—'

ada as the ex-pat destination de
jour? I propose Tahiti or maybe
Rio.)

Perhaps never before in con-
temporary American history has
a ﬁgure managed to be so polar-
izing. Few people have moder-
ated feelings towards Clinton—
she’s either deeply adored or
furiously hated. I

She, accordingly, inspires a
lot of discussion. She is so po-
larizing a ﬁgure that the Repub-
lican’s profound dislike of her is

even affecting their nomination _

race. I think the fact that the Re-
publicans assumed she’s pow-
erful enough to win is actually
what makes her the frontrunner.

In a catch-22, the foregone
conclusion makes it a foregone
conclusion.

Why? There really isn’t any
reason for Clinton to be the
frontrunner she is.

Clintonites always tout her
experience. They use this tactic
especially to draw contrast with
her two strongest rivals, Obama
and Edwards.

But it’s a load of crock. Check

. the math.

Clinton assumed ofﬁce in
2001. She has thus served in the

Senate for (a whopping) six years
(technically, she ’s just begun her
seventh). Obama assumed ofﬁce
in 2005 but served in the Illinois
State Senate for seven years——7

' plus 2 is 9,‘three years more than

Clinton.

Edwards served a six-year
term in the Senate and, thus,
has an equal number of years as
Hillary as a public servant.

And, although all three have
dropped out of the race already,

it should be pointed out that Sen-'

ators Joe Biden and Christopher
Dodd have 60 years in the Sen-
ate between them, while Gov.
Bill Richardson served over 20

years total as a Congressman, ‘

ambassador to the United Na-
tions, Secretary of Energy and
as governor of New Mexico.

Clearly, either Hillary can’t do
math or she is banking on a dif-
ferent deﬁnition of experience to
carry the day. Because, Hil, you
ain’t got squat. Even Kucinich
is whopping you in time in ofﬁce
(12 years in elected office).

No, when Hillary claims she
has experience, she ’s talking
about that ridiculous idea that
her eight years sharing the White
House bed with Bill—most of
the time, that is, Bill, you old
dog—gave her the‘ experience

that the ‘others didn’t get while
they were... umm, I dunno, actu-
ally serving as elected ofﬁcials.

Pillow talk certainly gave
Hillary a perspective on the
presidency all the other candi-
dates in both parties will never
have. But, the capability to have
sex with a president doesn’t re-
ally mean you inherit any of his
experience. (Or if I’m wrong-—
Monica for Congress!)

Even if her time as First Lady
should count as experience, her
record during those years isn’t
anything to brag about. The
health care revamp she led dur-
ing 1994 was a disaster for the
Clinton administration. After
that ﬂop, Clinton spent the re-

mainder of her time in ofﬁce‘

going on banal goodwill trips to
countries that the U.S. actually
couldn’t care less about.

And, incidentally, .being
sent in lieu of her husband for
a photo op with the Prime Min-
ister of Iceland before visiting
an elementary school class and
hopping back on a plane doesn’t
count as foreign policy experi-
ence. '

The bottom line is Hillary has
no more experienced than the
rest of the ﬁeld. Period.

So then why nominate her?

Clinton ’s_ onbz the ﬁontrunner because
the Republicans made her one A

As hated as she is by conserva.
tives everywhere, why risk so-
lidifying the conservative base
for whichever poor sucker wins
the Republican nod (I’m putting
a dollar on McCain) by nominat-
ing Hil?

The Democrats have a unique
opportunity—they could easily
use the disarray that the Repub-
licans are feeling because of a)
eight years of a terribly unpop-
ular President and b) a brutal
nomination ﬁght to sweep back
into the White House.

‘T hey could easily neutralize
any of the tired ‘old white men
who could be the Republican

nod by nominating Obama (di— 4’

versity) or Edwards (energy).

They could easily claim the
grounds of change, of hope, of
ending the war, of a fresh start.

But, instead of a fresh start,
the Democratic party is commit-
ting collective political suicide
by even considering a blast from
the past.

It’s simple——Hillary may be
the best candidate, but it doesn’t
matter. After the last 20 years
of Bush-Clinton-Bush, even
Americans aren’t stupid enough
to keep the pattern going.

It’s time for a fresh start.

ice: Barack Obama

He can inspire, solvenational issues and change the world

In a year when the Democratic Party is
so evenly divided between two strong can-
didates,'it seems fitting that our editorial
board was also divided. The vote between
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama split us
almost right down the middle.

Despite the divide, we’ve made our de-
cision. ~

Barack Obama deserves to be the nomi-
nee at the Centennial Mock Convention.

Obama offers our nation a chance to
move forward and step beyond the bitter
wrangling that has paralyzed Washington,
DC. in the last 15 years.

There’s no question that Hillary is a
great policy expert, well versed on almost
every major issue facing our country. We

o think she would be a strong president.

In a debate last week, Clinton said she
envisioned being a hands-on president,
handling big and small issues from the
Oval Ofﬁce. Obama took the opposite tack,‘
saying he wants to spend his time planning
the country’s overall direction while let-
ting his staff handle the details.

But we don’t need a policy wonk in the
White House right now.

We need a visionary leader, someone
who can inspire our citizens again and give
us new ideas about solving the great prob-
lems of the 21st century. ,

Obama offers that hope, that vision.
He can be our generation’s John F. Ken-
nedy or Ronald Reagan. Those men used
the Oval Oﬁice as a platform to lead and
inspire the nation.

Almost every Obama speech ends
with the call to duty: “Let’s go change the
world.”

How can Hillary’s policy expertise
match that? The short answer: it can’t.

The next president will inherit a deeply
divided nation unsure of how we should
handle Iraq, the continued hunt for Bin
Laden and a host of other issues.

The new president will have to navigate
a poisonous political atmosphere that has
made it virtually impossible for Democrats
and Republicans to work with each other
on any important issue.

There’s just no way the Clintons can
heal these partisan wounds and get Ameri-
ca moving forward again. _

Nothing makes Republicans dig in their
heels more than the sight of the Clintons.

And as Bill’s bullying ego trip contin-
ues across America (calling Obama’s Iraq
positions a fairy tale in New Hampshire
and then whining about how the big, bad
Nevada unions are out to get poor 01’ Hill-
ary), we’re left to wonder why anyone
wants to return to the'drama-ﬁlled days of
his presidency. .

In fact, most of Bill’s speeches during
this campaign seem to mention him far
morethan they mention his wife. Who are
we voting for here?

Here’s what Bill doesn’t realize: Ameri-
cans want the economic boom of the 1990s
back, but they don’t want Bill to come
along in the time machine. Besides, the in-
temet boom created those great economic
days, not anything he did.

That’s what both Clintons just don’t
get. '

Our generation is tired of listening to
old politicians whine and argue from the
same political positions.

We’re sick of hearing them take credit
for things they didn’t do.

We’ve heard the Clintons before and
know what they have to say. America is
ready for new ideas, a new vision.

The second Bush presidency was far
worse than the ﬁrst one; Is anyone worried
that we might see the same pattern with the
Clintons?

Obama can take us beyond this rancor
and melodrama that Hillary’s nomina-

tion would promise. He can take this na- .

tion into a post-partisan world, ﬁnally get
young Americans excited about politics
and start the next great American era.‘

Hillary’s the safe choice, the vote you
make with your head.

Obama’s the inspiring choice, the vote
you make with your heart.

This weekend, go with your heart and
vote ‘for Obama.

Are you ﬁred up? Get ready to go.

West Virginia,

By Andrew Connelly and

STAFF wRm:Rs

Students across campus have
been bombarded with the news
surrounding Mock Convention,
but how many are familiar with
the delegations? We sat down
with several State Chairs to ex-
plore the personal side of Mock
Convention.

Wesley O’Dell, the State
Chair of West Virginia, is mak-
ing sure that his delegation per-
forms to its fullest capabilities.

“West Virginia is very seri-
ous about its research and pre-
diction,” said O’Dell. “Mock
Con. is such an important facet
of W&L li-fe — we deﬁnitely want
to do what we can to continue its
tradition of excellence.”

But for O’Dell, the parties are
just as important.

In all honesty, I am truly not
stressed about Mock Conven-
tion. However, you must con-
sider the fact that I am a fresh-
man delegate. The extent of my
participation in this inimitable
event has been the purchase of
a t-shirt and maybe contributing
a few dollars for a commemora-
ti-ve shot glass. Despite my elev-
enth hour efforts, I do realize that
copious amounts of work have
gone into preparation for this
week and weekend. The state
chairs of mock convention have
voluntarily conceded to assume
a large part of the responsibility
for the success of this affair.

Unbeknownst to many, the
role of a state chair began last
year. Since last winter term,
Washington and Lee’s student
leaders have been applying for
positions, mailing in their re-
sumes and going through an in-
terview process. Fortunately for
those interested, the university’s

nthusiastic state chairs speak up

Michigan, Alaska and Hawaii chairs share their excitement and nerves

already had a great Gala last fall
and we look forward to enjoying
the various delegation parties

- this week—particularly an event

we and a few other small states
have combined to host.”

Neil Sheaffer is the State
Chair of Michigan, a state that

“It’s disappointing to be sure,
but there’s nothing we can do
about it,” he said. “[Our] del-
egation is all about ﬁnding ways
to enjoy the convention, like by
building a fun ﬂoat, even though
we will have no say in who the
nominee will be.”

“Mock Con. is such an important facet of W&L

lif —- we deﬁnitely want to do what we can to
continue its tradition of excellence... T he social
events surrounding Mock Con are (also) an
integral part of the experience. ”

Wesley 0’Dell, West Virginia state chair

in the actual political arena lost
its delegates when it moved the
primaries to‘ January 15"‘, break-
ing the rules of the Democratic
National Convention.

But this hasn’t deterred She-
affer from enjoying Mock Con.

Sheaffer regrets the DNC’s
decision to strip the state of its
delegates. He says Michigan
has a lot at stake in this election,
citing its shrinking population,
and the search for alternative
energy, which will beneﬁt both

the statc’s auto industry and the
farmers who produce corn for
ethanol.

Especially interesting is the
approach taken by the smaller
delegations representing Amer-
ica’s more remote and often
overlooked areas. For Robert
Wilson, the Alaska State Chair,
the reality of having few genuine
Alaskans at W & L has a price.

“No one in our delegation is

actually from Alaska, so we’ve
all had to do some basic research
on the political climate there.
Only three [out of ﬁfteen] of us
have even been there.”

Compounding this is the lack
of interest shown in Alaska by
the mainstream media.

“Research has been tough, as
there have been no ofﬁcial polls
taken in Alaska to gauge the sta-
tus of the Democratic race.”

This problem has also been
noted by the Hawaii State Chair
Grace Andrews. '

I “There is no polling data and
a lot of major candidates don’t
care. This makes our decision a
hard one. Local newspapers are
often the only source of data and
they are potentially biased.”

This has been a hindrance, but
hasn’t stopped Andrews and her
delegation from delving deeply
into Hawaii’s unique local politi-
cal scene. Close contacts with
local political participants like
Michael McCartney, the Demo-
cratic Party Leader in the state,
and Richard Boreka,‘ a lead-
ing Hawaiian columnist, have
helped Andrews and her team
stay on top of their research.
The unique nature of Hawaiian
politics also helps to keep things
interesting.” ‘

“Hawaii has an fascinat-
ing political environment, that
doesn’t follow many of the pat-
terns in the rest of the US. There
are lots of independents and the
partisan atmosphere common

79

elsewhere is lacking somewhat.

As an example,‘ she offers
up the candidacy of Dennis Ku-
cinich for the 2004 Democratic
presidential nomination. Ig-
nored by the media and not even
on the ballot in many states he
managed to come second behind
John Kerry in Hawaii’s primary

. with 31 percent of the votes.

As with the Alaska, the Ha-
waii delegation has few native
members (one out of the twenty
seven was born there and moved
away at any early age), but An-
drews maintains that the charac-
ter of the islands is strong enough
to bring the group together.

“We are an eclectic group,
like the islands themselves. We
all come from different back-
grounds, geographically, social-
ly and academically. We were
brought together by Hawaii’s
exhilarating and mysterious na-
ture.”

of Mock Con share their thoughts

discuss some of the trials and tribulations of heading delegations

sitions for all those who were

interested. “Mock convention is

great because it allows everyone

to contribute their own special
talents,” said West Virginia State
Chair Wes O’Dell, “The poli-
tics people, social people, press
people and so many more can be
a part of the making of history.”
Interestingly enough, all of these
men and women consented to
this procedure without a full un‘-
derstanding of what each step
would entail. “To me, the inter-
view was hilarious, because I go
in and there’s a line of people,”
recalls Puerto Rico State Chair
Aisha Davis, “We’re all thinking
that we have no idea what's go-
ing on right now.”

Jordan Wilson’s experience
was a little different. As the only
freshman state chair, the ambi-
tious student stands out. “Over
the summer, I sent out-emails to
the directors of Mock Con. to see
ifl could help out...l found out
that the position in Guam was
open and my name got recom-
mended and I got interviewed for
it....I think that I’m living proof
that if you’re interested in some-

thing here, you can ﬁnd some
outlet for it.”

The state chairs are respon-
sible for managing their delega-
tion. They are the lucky few who
have the privilege of sending out
the mass emails about meetings,
t-shirts and ﬂoat construction.
According to'Arizona State Chair
Justin McKeen, “Most impor-
tantly, a. state chair is in charge
of directing delegates under his
state and coming up with, hope-
fully, a correct prediction for
how his state is going to vote.”
The delegations are responsible
for determining their position by
extrapolating from the research
done by both the state chair and
his or her research chair. “The
biggest and most important one
[responsibility],” in the opin-
ion of Maine State Chair James
Dick, “is researching: state polls,
newspapers, blogs, talking to
people within that state in order
to understand what the people in
that state are looking for.”

However, a project this large
entails complicated planning and
logistics on the part of its leaders.
Every state had its own share of

problems. “My delegation was

pretty small, about sixteen peo-

ple. So anytime that I needed
something done, I needed ev-
eryone to be there. As opposed
to larger delegations like Texas
and Virginia, who can send out
a mass email and get twenty vol-
unteers,” said Tennessee State

don’t speak Spanish. So when I
was on the phone I’d always be
looking for someone who spoke
English,” Davis said. However,
a _lack of information was another
obstacle that the state chairs had
to battle. “[The] most particular
obstacle,” for James Dick, “is

that Maine is not considered by

“A state chair is in charge of directing

delegates under his state and coming up

with, hopefully, a correct prediction for

how his state is going to vote. ’

J

Justin McKeen, Arizona state chair

Chair, Rebecca LeMoine. Be-
sides size, distance continually

thwarted research and communi-

cation. “I had to send out emails
that would cross the internation-
al dateline,” remembers Jordan
Wilson. While Jordan had to
overcome intemational barri-
ers, Aisha Davis had to triumph
over the language barrier. “Even
though I chose Puerto Rico, I

the national media to be an im-
portant part of the nomination
process, so there was a dearth of
polls.”

Despite all the difﬁculties, the
state chairs still have interesting
moments and a myriad of events
to enjoy thisweekend. When
asked what his most unique ex-
perience was, James Dick im-
mediately answered, “Buying a

lobster costume for one of my
fraternity brothers to wear on the
Mock Convention ﬂoat. I don’t
know what I ’in going to do when
Mock Con. is over.”

Davis recalls the two hour
long t-shirt planning meeting and
a certain gift comes to McKeen’s
mind.

“One of my contacts in Tus-
con was a W&L alum. When he
heard that I was a state chair for
Mock Convention, he gave me a
bottle of Jim Bean that was es-
pecially made for W&L’s Mock
Con. when he was a student.”

The state chairs are looking

' forward to rest, relaxation and

the enjoying the events planned
for the convention itselﬁ Nota-
ble speakers, such as Jesse Jack-

son and Tim Kaine, will be con- ’

tributing words to the ceremony.
Still, others are ready to bask
in the pleasure of smaller gifts.
“I’m just happy thatil won’t have
to send out mass emails any-
more,” admits LeMoine.

Through the years

 After I 00 years, convention has
seen its share of highs and lows

 

1908

After a visit by populist William
Jennings Bryan, students get to-
gether and hold a replica of the
real Democratic Convention. The
event gets off to an excellent start,
but the debate over whether to
nominate Bryan or Minnesota Gov.
John A. Johnson soon turns ugly,
as ﬁghts break out in the Kansas
delegation and several other spots
on the Convention floor. The 2008
convention, like the 1908 conven-
tion, will be held in Denver. At the
1908 affair, Bryan's victory gave
W&L its first correct prediction.

1924

After a record-setting number of
ballots, W&L students select John
W. Davis, an undergraduate and
law alumnus, who served as a
Congressman from West Virginia,
Solicitor General and Ambassador
to Great Britain. At that summer’s
convention, Davis, who received
only three percent of the delegates
on the first ballot, was finally elect-
ed after 103 ballots, a record that
will likely never be broken. Unfor-
tunately, Davis gets massacred in
the election by Republican Calvin
Coolidge, who wins 54 percent of
the vote while Davis earns less
than 29 percent.

1956

Former Vice President Alben Bar-
kley, who returned to the Senate
after his term as Vice President
ended, gives the keynote speech.
in front ofa cheering crowd, he de-
clares, “For I would rather be a ser-
vant in the house of the Lord than
to sit in the seats of the mighty.”
As the crowd cheers, Barkley col-
lapses and dies almost instantly.
At the urging of Barkley‘s widow,
the convention eventually resumes

and picks Adlai Stevenson.

1960

Former President Harry Truman
helps dedicate a memorial to
Barkley and then delivers the key-

0

note address. Early voting puts
Stevenson on top again, but the
staff doesn't have enough adding
machines to calculate the votes.
While the convention waits, several
delegations switch their votes to
John F. Kennedy, sending him on
his way to the White House.

19721

A fierce debate breaks out between
supporters of George McGovern
and Ted Kennedy. Kennedy wins
the W&L nod, but McGovern gets
the win at the real convention.
After McGovern gets hammered
by Nixon, some students wonder
if the convention had a better feel
for the national political climate
than the Democratic Party did.

Jimmy Carter, than the obscure
governor of Georgia, addresses
the convention.

1988

Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, already
a rising star in the Democratic
Party, speaks at Mock Convention.
But the real excitement comes that
night at Zo|lman's Pavilion, when
Clinton hops up on stage tojam out
on a saxophone.

2004 1

Despite the noisy protests of a few
Deaniacs, John Kerry cruises to vic-
tory. Democratic strategist James
Carville, sometimes known as the
Rajun Cajun, bashes the GOP in
his keynote address.
