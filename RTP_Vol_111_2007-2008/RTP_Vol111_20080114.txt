As Washington and Lee’s
most active judicial body, the
Student Judicial Council main-
tains a surprisingly low proﬁle.
That is, until a conduct violation
lands you in front of them.

And that’s something SJC
Chairman Shane Wilson aims to
change.

“A lot of students aren’t
aware of what the SJC is, what
our role is, what we’re doing,

what our policies are,” said Wil-
son.

That issue grew
more complicated recently when
a major policy change
altered the procedures
and implications of a
“ﬁrst strike;” ﬁrst-time
student offenders can
now be penalized ad-
ministratively through
the Dean of Students’ of-
ﬁce rather than by a trial
before the SJC, the body
tasked with enforcing uni-
versity policies dealing
with student behavior—in-
cluding alcohol and drug
violations.

The new policy also al-
lowed ﬁrst strikes to be ex-
punged from students’ records
after a period of good behav-
ior. .

Many students accused W&L
of backsliding on student self-
governance with these changes
and the appointment of Associate
Dean of Students Brandon Dotson
as the SJC’s ﬁrst advisor.

Wilson, a veteran SJC Justice,
ran on a platform designed to edu-
cate the student body about the SJC
while addressing concerns about the
body’s independence. Having worked
in the new system for several months,

however, he is pleased with its progress:

“Basically, [the new policy] helps students
out if they’ve had one strike,” Wilson said. [If]
they go 52 weeks without having a second inci-
dent, the strike is effectively treated as an edu-
cational opportunity which would not result in
a permanent disciplinary ﬁle so, in terms of re-
porting to graduate schools and medical schools
and employers, a student does not have to say
that he or she had a serious conduct incident.
That’s a really great change that’s happening for
students at W&L.”

He is also pleased that the SJC is once again
hearing select ﬁrst-offense cases, “As coopera-
tion increases, as we rebuild a lot of our trust and
credibility with the faculty, Dean Dotson and I
are able to talk about cases individually and say
‘this is a ﬁrst incident, but it’s kind of egregious

Praise for new policy

SJ C adapts, educates as strike rules change

He also hopes to address student concerns
about the disciplinary duties of the SJC: “We’re
not looking to throw people under the bus...
we’re not the police...we’re looking to prepare
students to go out from W&L and represent our
university honorably.”

Dotson shares Wilson’s belief in the educa-
tional mission of the SJC and reciprocates his
praise.

“Shane Wilson is an outstanding student
leader. . .his leadership has brought a lot of new
ideas. He really cares about students at W&L as
individuals,” he said. “It’s an absolute pleasure
to work with the SJC.”

Dotson stressed that his role is one that helps
maximize the SJC’s potential and increase its re-
sources—and he’s pleased with its progress.

He offered particular accolades for the

and we want to see what students have to say
about it.’”
“It works well because we can weigh in on
situations that aren’t standard,” he said.
As for the controversial advisory position,
Wilson has nothing but praise for Dotson:
“[Dean Dotson] has been a great advisor and
wonderful asset. . .he’s been a pleasure to
work with,” he said, citing in particular the
inﬂux of funds and resources that SJC has
enjoyed this year.

“We have a laptop, we have a printer, we have
some discretionary funds we can use for getting
the word out, for education,” he said.

Education is key to Wilson’s vision for the
SJC: education about the rules, about the pen-
alties, and about the body itself. The group has
worked throughout the year to be more visible;
they’ve manned a booth at the student activities
fair and helped sponsor several mailings cau-
tioning students to enjoy themselves responsi-
bly. Future plans include community forums to
bring the SJC’s message—and its warnings—to
the students.

“Students have a right to know,” said Wil-
son.

group‘s ability to follow university policies
“with the individual student and the community
interests in mind,” and characterized its future as
“extremely bright.” In the long-terrn, he hopes to
see the SJ C take its place as “the frontrunner in
sound student self-governance.”

Junior Justice Chris Tutor, who announced he
is running for an ofﬁcer position in the next elec-
tion, may be a part of that future and he consid-
ers the changes beneﬁcial.

“Shane has done a
wonderful job of getting the SJC the credibil-
ity it needs so the faculty don’t pull the plug. I
think it’s more efficient this year, Dotson said.
“Andl think he’s really tried to be more proac-
tive in getting these issues out there,” he said,
referencing the policy of mandatory suspension
for students refusing a breathalyzer test at the
police station after a Driving Under the Inﬂu-
ence arrest.

Said Tutor, “I think everyone from the faculty
to the administration to the student body should
have 100 percent conﬁdence in the SJC and I
think we’ve done a_wonderful job.”

Chairman Wilson concurs: “I try to be fair
and I feel like we do that.”

Water ate’s le ac
Bob Woodward to mg; students, faculty in holiigrsymposgi Of  Students

By John Henderson
STAFF WRITER

Since September 11, 2001,
President Bush’s war on terror-
ism has been one of the hot-but-
ton issues in American politics.

From the Iraq war to the Pa-
triot Act, the Bush administration
has been known to make deci-
sions behind closed doors. In-
vestigative reporter Bob Wood-
ward, who will speak at W&L
on Friday, is one of the few and

showed how authorities deep in-
side the White House had worked
to cover up the break-in.

On the verge of impeachment,
President Richard Nixon made
history by being the ﬁrst Ameri-
can president to resign from of-
ﬁce.

When the Woodward and
Bernstein spoke at the Society
of Professional Journalists con-
ference last fall, the room was
packed with reporters who want-
ed to hear from the reporters,

Lee’s Director of Special Pro-
grams, said that the symposium
is designed to foster discussion.
“It’s one thing to sit at the feet of
a celebrity—it’s another thing to
engage that celebrity,” Fure said.

“[The Institute for Honor]
wants to create a community of
leaming——a community that is
much larger than at W&L be-
cause it includes adults. People
of all ages can talk to each other
about the questions the program
raises.”

Prowler caught in houses

Rockbridge County Sheriff ’s deputies arrested a prowler Wednesday morning behind a W&L stu-
dent’s house. . .

Lt. Tim Hickman of the sheriff ’s department said deputies were dispatched to 664 Greenhouse Road
(near the old County Seat Traveller stop) after a female student called 911 and said she could hear some-
one in the ﬁrst ﬂoor of her house.

A deputy went behind the house and found Chad Williams, a 25-year-old Lexington resident, leaving
the house. "

The prowler apparently visited more than one house before being caught by police.

W&L senior F emi Kusimo said he woke up at about 5:45 a.m. Wednesday morning when he heard
the door to his bedroom open.

Kusimo, a senior who lives at Pole 4, said he thought his roommate was coming into the room to bug
him.

“I told my roommate to go away,” but then the guy said something and I new it was [someone from

Cedar Lake Comes to Lexington

In tutus danclng to lullaby muslc come to mlnd.
Admittedly, l’ve never been a big fan. My perceptlon
changed, however, when I was Introduced to the work
of the New York clty based company Cedar Lake.
Watching their performance, I soon reallzed that they
were unllke any ballet group I had seen before (and
with ﬂve sisters, I've seen my falr share). cedar Lake
utlllzes unique, lnnovatlve dance technlques to dellver
a gripping show even for skeptlcs. Gravity seems not
to blnd these dancers as their stage ls-not llmlted to
the ﬂoor but extends to the walls and celllng. Thls
multl-dlmenslonal approach to ballet coupled with
contemporary muslc overwhelms the senses and makes
for a remarkable experlence for ballet connolsseurs and
novlces allke.

After seelng a vldeo of the performance,
sophomore Prarna Mansukhanl descrlbed It as,
“Awesome! Deﬂnltely the coolest ballet I've seen. It’s
amazing what they’re able to do”.

On January 31, Cedar Lake will be welcomed
to campus and exhlblt thls lnnovatlve dance In a
performance open to all audlences. This Is a great

You picked a Winner

Mock Convention.‘ more than just a wild party this year

As the Democratic race see-
saws across the country, Wash-
ington and Lee suddenly has a
chance to end the mystery.

Who will it be? Hillary or
Obama? Edwards - probably not
so much.

Hillary’s victory in New
Hampshire deﬁed the polling data
and newspaper articles that were
predicting her campaign’s immi-
nent collapse.

That resurgence — the second
time a Clinton has used New
Hampshire to launch a comeback
— means that Mock Convention
actually has a real prediction to
make.

Too many of the last conven-
tions have been nothing but a
rubber stamp on conventional
wisdom. By convention time in
2004, everyone knew Kerry was
the runaway winner. Bush had a
clear advantage in 2000 and old-
man Dole ran away with things in
1996.

In fact, not since 1992 (re-
member that other Clinton, the
one who played sax on stage at
Zollman’s?) have the political
gurus around campus had such a

difﬁcult decision to make.

In 1992, the convention man-
aged to select Clinton even
though the first ﬁve primaries
produced four different winners.
This year’s race is more of a two-
horse show, but nobody seems to
know who really has the edge.
Obama is exciting new voters, but
Hillary’s New Hampshire victory
showed that older voters — and es-
pecially older women — still carry

less than two weeks from now.

A week after Mock Conven-
tion, twenty-two states will go to
the polls on Super Tuesday. No-
body knows if that massive day of
voting will settle the race or leave
it dragging on to the real conven-
tion in Denver in the summer.

The Mock Con organizers
love to brag about the conven-
tion’s history and accuracy. Those
boasts are an important reminder

That resurgence — the second time a Clinton

has used New Hampshire to launch a come-

back — means that Mock Convention actually

has a real prediction to make.

Too many of the last conventions have been

nothing but a rubber stamp 

 

a lot of clout.

And so while the press and
political establishment scramble
around the country looking for the
secret to the nomination the win-
ner will be revealed in Lexington

that the convention is about more
than a wild weekend of drinking
red, white and blue beer (all in the
name of patriotism, right?).

And, yes, in some years (like
1988’s famous Clinton moment)

the partying has been more.im-
portant than the convention.

But other years like the inau-
gural event in 1908 when del-
egates got so excited that a brawl
broke out between supporters of
rival candidates, this event has
been about politics ﬁrst and par-
tying second.

But amid the revelry, there’s
some serous business to deal
with.

Nobody wants to be part of
the convention that spent thou-
sands of dollars andthousands of
hours planning, organizing and
enjoying the event that picked the
wrong candidate.

Aside from the honor system,
alumni mention Mock Con as one
of the most important things that
make W&L what it is.

And so as the festivities get
underway, the ﬂoats get built
and the political bigwigs roll into
town, take a minute to check the
polls and see how your state will
vote.

Across the nation, Democrats
want a candidate. Mock Conven-
tion matters again.

Why doesn’t W&L honor MLK Day?

The school, with its low number of minorities, has a duty to honor his principles

By Jess Steinmetz
STAFF WRITER

Every year on the third Mon-
day of January, federal otﬁces,
post ofﬁces, banks and schools
across this nation close to honor
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As
we all know, this admirable civil
rights leader spoke out against
segregation, discrimination and
hate. The day is taken off to re-
member King and to honor his
memory.

So why do we not do this in
Rockbridge County? The banks
and post oﬂices will, of course,
close but students attending both
local colleges and Rockbridge
County Schools will be in class.

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty thankfully does not completely
ignore Martin Luther King Jr.,
Day. We celebrate with a birthday
party for the children of the com-
munity, a lecture delivered by a
distinguished African-American
writer and_a candlelight proces-
sion. But is this really enough?

What does it say about our
school that it simply omits a na-

~s<.3”t£§«‘:»-e‘
I-Z<«<‘~.§..t.¥Z?25

    

tional holiday from our sched-
ules? I am sure there is a some-
what valid reason on paper why
we attend class on this day.

Likewise, Rockbridge County
Schools made the decision to fail
to observe the holiday this year,
because the school closed at least
once for inclement weather be-
fore January.

In 1986, President Ronald
Reagan declared Martin Luther
King Jr. Day a federal public holi-
day. Prior to this, King’s birthday
was observed as a public holiday
in 27 states and the District of Co-
lumbia.

Martin Luther King Jr. stood
for the non-violent ﬁght for
equality, dignity and freedom for
all races and peoples. Why is this
not good enough for W&L?

There has been great reluc-
tance to observe Martin Luther
King Jr. Day both before and after
the bill was passed. The state of
Virginia originally added Martin
Luther King Jr. Day to Lee Jack-
son Day thus it became known as
Lee-Jackson-King Day.

How ironic is it that this holi-

day celebrated not only a civil

The state of Virginia ﬁnally
recognized Martin Luther King
Jr. Day in 2000. In my home
state of California, no one would
even dream of attending school
on Martin Luther King Day. But
I could never imagine honoring
a Confederate Army General or
a Confederate ﬂag hanging in a
dorm room back home either.
Even after all of the work by
civil rights leaders, there still is
discrimination and hate in our so-
ciety today. W&L’s location in the
South makes it’s observation of
Martin Luther King Jr. Day even

more imperative.

Our school is not exactly
known for diversity or lack of rac-
ism. Are we not only reinforcing
these stereotypes about us by not
observing the only national holi-
day dedicated to a commemorat-
ing an African-American?

Furthermore, it is our duty as
a prestigious institution of higher
learning to show our commitment
to the principles of Martin Luther
King Jr.

There is no more perfect way
than doing this than by the simple
observation of the holiday that
was intended to honor his mem-

ory.

New exhibit in Staniar Gallery shows how scanners can double as cameras

By Queenle Wong
STAFF WRITER

Co-curators of the exhibition
“Scanner as Camera,” Ruth Ad-
ams and Christa Bowden, at a
joint lecture Thursday revealed
the process and techniques they
and other artists used to create the
pieces featured in the university’s
Staniar Gallery.

“I think that ﬁnally just in the
last ﬁve years or so we have taken
those two things, Photoshop and
the scanner, and brought them
into our art world. We use them
as speciﬁc tools to get the look
that we want,” said Adams to a
packed Concert Hall.

The lecture and the exhibition
showcased the works of Adams
and Bowden along with six other
contemporary artists! Stephen
Althouse, Darryl Curran, Val-
erie Mendoza, J. Seeley, Rhona

Shand and Maggie Taylor--who
used the ﬂatbed scanner as a digi-
tal camera.

Adams and Bowden demon-
strated different ways each art-
ist used the scanner to create a
unique look. Through a series of
slides, the audience consisting of
students, faculty and community
members saw the artists’ original
works before they digitally ma-
nipulated them. With each slide,
the audience saw the artists’ scans
gradually change, illustrating
how they got to the ﬁnal product.

Adams for example, an assis-
tant professor of art at the Univer-
sity of Kentucky, reluctantly re-
vealed that the blurry background
in her piece “Moulin Rouge” was
actually a scan of her hair.

“It’s an entirely different way
of working,” said Bowden, an as-
sistant professor of art at Wash-

ington and Lee University.
Audience member reactions
to the lecture and exhibit were
positive.
Ellen Martin, a photographer

lor, whose works portray a sense.

background of her photographs.
“It makes me want to go

“It makes me want to go home, take my scan-

ner apart, put some of the techniques I saw in

the show and put them to use. ’

HANS RILLING, local photographer
 

in Rockbridge County, said that
the lecture helped her understand
scanography better. Martin said
that she appreciated the fact that
the artists revealed some of their
techniques rather than keeping
them private. For example, she

home, take my scanner apart, put
some of the techniques I saw in
the show and put them to use,”
said Hans Rilling, another pho-
tographer in the county.
Freshman Kyle Parsons de-
scribed the photographs as “re-

ally interesting.”

The exhibition was first
presented at the University of
Kentucky’s Tuska Center for
Contemporary Art in November
2006. Adams, Bowden, Curran
and Taylor were part of a panel
that discussed scanography at the
Society of Photographic Educa-
tion’s annual conference in 2006.
Althouse and Seeley also attend-
ed the conference. It was after the
panel that Bowden and Adams
began to organize the exhibition.

Choosing artists was a difﬁ-
cult decision due to the number
of artists across the nation that
work with scanners. Yet a small
group, which represented how
artists were using these tools just
“made more sense,” Adams said.

They wanted to showcase a
variety of styles in the exhibition
rather than having all the works

look the same.

Mendoza’s “Insomnia” for
example, took advantage of the
technology’s shortcomings — the
claustrophobic feeling created by
the boundaries of the scanner --
in order to illustrate her struggle
with insomnia.

Taylor and Shand used a more
traditional approach by scanning
two-dimensional objects. Shand’s
works also depict a sense of ee-
riness not present in the other
works.

“Scanner as Camera” will re-
main on view at the Staniar Gal-
lery until Feb. 15. The gallery,
located in the Wilson Center, is
open to students and the public
during day-time hours.

“I really love how the show
is...and we are hoping that it’s
going to travel,” said Adams.

Walk Hard

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

I used to work in a movie rent-
al store. For about half a year,
for some God-forsaken reason,
my manager thought the only
movies that were appropriate to
play in-store were the musician
biopics that were the fad at the
time—“Walk Hard,” “Ray,” and
the like.

Anyone who has ever seen
even a little of this genre can in-

_ stantly recognize the many cli-

chés it offers.

Maybe that’s why I laughed
like a drunk hyena for the first
20 minutes of “Walk Hard: The
Dewey Cox Story.” The Judd

Knocked up 2

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

There’s usually not much
that’s funny about teen pregnancy
(duh). But in this art-house ﬂick
heavy movie season, “Juno” is a
stunning little gem that makes it
look hilarious. .

Go see this movie. It’s proba-
bly not the best ﬁrst date choice-
“so. . .umm. . .about that drink I
invited you up for. . .”—but it’s a
must see.

The screenwriter is one Dia-

You ’ll laugh like a drunken hyena, but the gags get stale in this send-up of movies about musicians

Apatow Gang’s newest is a send-
up of the musical biopic that’s re-
ally, really funny...for about 20
minutes.

After that, the jokes, just like
the genre itself, become stilted
and stale.

Maybe the problem was the
go-for-broke approach to jokes.
Apatow and co. are deﬁnitely
the new comedic royalty of H01-
lywood~they can come up with
funny stuff endlessly. But some-
times, less is more.

“Walk Hard” proves that more
than any of their previous works.

The ﬁlm takes a very “Air-
plane”-esque approach to things.
Basically, if it’s a gag—be it a
sight gag, a bit of slap-stick, a

sex joke, a pun, anything—do
it. It was funny the ﬁrst time
that Dewey tore a sink off the
wall, so of course it’s going to be
funny seeing it eight more times.
Right? Hello?

Don’t get me wrong, the ﬁlm’s
funny throughout. It’s just not
that funny.

The jokes get old, the wit dulls,
and the character of Cox becomes
just as one-dimensional as can be.
And sadly, tortured genius still
isn’t quite funny enough.

As for the acting, Reilly’s
still got great presence. Jenna
Fischer—of “Ofﬁce” fame—is
hilarious ripping the June Carter
Cashes of the world. She’s one of
the only enduringly bright spots

of the movie.

The supporting cast is a virtual
who’s-who of comedians—-Tim
Meadows, Chris Parnell, Harold
Ramis, John Michael Higgins,
Paul Rudd, Justin Long, Jason
Schwartzman and Jack Black all
show up in funny little scenes.

Jack White even put in a side-
splitting half-minute of screen
time as Elvis.

All that was really missing
was Will Ferrell showing up in
blackface as Jimi Hendrix. And
honestly, they went for every oth-
er gag, why not that?

All and all, “Walk Hard” is
stuck in a twisted little catch-22:
it can’t poke fun at how formu-
laic biopics are without being te-

diously. . .umm. . .forrnulaic. Just
like biopics that take themselves
seriously, even the incredible tal-
ent of the cast can’t save a con-
strained and usually depressing
story.

It’s sad, really, that one John
C. Reilly’s poorer roles has
earned him his most well-known
award nomination. I love Reilly
as an actor, but he should not take
home this year’s Golden Globe
for Lead Actor in a Comedy or
Musical.

Reilly stole what should’ve
been Seth Rogen’s nomination
for “Knocked Up.” Neither of
the two roles deserves to beat
Tom Hanks’ turn as Charlie Wil-
son, or Johnny Depp’s Sweeney

Todd, but it’s still a shame Reilly
got nominated over Rogen.

Given Reilly’s many great
previous roles, what’s especial-
ly shameful is that it was a bad
Johrmy Cash meets Cal from Tal-
ladega Nights that did it. Boo,
Golden Globes.

“Walk Hard” is deﬁnitely hu-
morous enough to be worth rent-
ing, but it’s hardly the best satire
of the year. So go rent it. I Hope-
fully it’s R rating will keep some
poor 16-year-old kid from seeing
it endlessly down at the Block-
buster.

I promise these gags won’t be
funny the 500th time.

You wouldn ’t expect a comedy about teen pregnancy, but Juno delivers a witty look at life with a big belly

blo Cody, a blogger and novel-
ist who—side note—published a
memoir in 2006 about her time
as a stripper. The book, “Candy
Girl” was the ﬁrst book selected
for Dave Letterman’s book club.
Go ﬁgure.

The ﬁlm’s supporting cast is
excellent. Cody created a great
set of characters, from the too-
cool-to-be-true dad to the too-
adorable-to-be-real baby’s daddy.
The cast does a universally great
job with each of their roles.

Of particular note are Jenni-

fer Garner and Jason Bateman as
the adoptive parents—to—be. Bate-
man’s cool yuppie is pitch per-
fect, while Garner delivers one of
the ﬁlm’s top moments.

In a ﬁlm where the antagonist
is actually growing within the
protagonist, Garner’s role pro-
vides a good stand-in for the au-
dience’s disdain. Yet despite this,
she still commands sympathy—a
delicate spot of acting, superbly
done.

Michael Cerra, as the lovable
geek who knocks Juno up (“he’s

great in. . .chair”) is so-so.

He doesn’t really seem to be
fully comfortable with his char-
acter. Part of this is Cody’s fault.
Part is probably that Cerra is still
a young actor.

I’m willing to forgive this dim
spot though. It’s one of the few
parts of the ﬁlm where the mark
is missed, and the movie is in no
way about Paulie Gleeker any-
way.

This ﬁlm belongs to Juno.

As for that, I’ll say this'—if
Ellen Page doesn’t receive an

Oscar nod this year, it’s a down-
right insult. Seriously, she’s that
good. Cody’s character is one of
the wittiest in recent ﬁlm. But it’s
Page’s brilliant performance that
brings the character fully to life.

Page is only 20 years old and
her ﬁrst major role was playing
a pregnant teen in love with that
guy from “Superbad,” so don’t
expect an Oscar win. The Acad-
emy has shown an unfortunate
fear of rewarding young actors or
daring roles. _

All the same, watch this one’s

career. She’s, umm. . .supergood.

“Juno” opened into wide-re-
lease on Christmas day. It’s a ﬁt-
ting choice. The same day when
a miraculous birth is traditionally
celebrated, we’re given another
miracle to look at.

A movie about teen pregnancy
that’s not preachy or political,
that handles the uncomfortable
with grace and is also whip-
smart, funny, and poignant-now
that’s a Christmas miracle.

Wrestling ﬁnishes fourth of seven teams at ﬁrst home meet

By Mlchael Keenan
spams canon

The Washington and Lee wrestling team
. competed in its ﬁrst home event, the W&L Invi-
tational, on Saturday. The Generals totaled 58.5
points, good for fourth out of seven teams. The
Generals beat Scranton, Waynesburg and South-
ern Virginia but fell to team champion Mt. St.
Joseph, Washington & Jefferson and Muhlen-
berg. W&L’s alternates also totaled 17 points
that did not count toward the team total.

The Generals were led by senior Anthony
Boniello, who took ﬁrst place in the 165-pound
weight class, the only General to win his weight
class. After receiving a ﬁrst-round bye, Boniello
cruised past SVU’s Julian James by a ﬁnal score
of 6-1. In the ﬁnal, Boniello captured ﬁrst place
by beating Josh Sasfy of Mt. St. Joseph, 7-2.

In addition to Boniello’s win, the Generals
had a number of other strong performances,
including third-place ﬁnishes by seniors Peter
Lawrence, Tim Manson and Kirk Adamson and
junior John Christopher.

Lawrence opened his day by pinning Scran-
ton’s Mike Ebert in 4:56. In the championship
semiﬁnals, Lawrence was defeated in a very close
rriatch by Muhlenberg’s Rob Kevin. Lawrence
trailed 4-3 most of the third period but could not
get controlfor the two points needed to give him
théi lead. Witli just seconds left, Lawrence’s last
attempt wasithwlarted and Kevin gained control
. as the buzzer sounded to make the ﬁnal score 6-

3. However, Lawrence rebounded with two vic-
tories to take third place in the 149-pound class.
He defeated teammate senior Eric Gagne 14-7
inthe consolation semis and then bested‘ Wash-
ington and Jefferson’s Shaun Yackey 7-5 in the
consolation ﬁnals.

Manson operied his day with a hard-fought pin
against Muhlenberg’s Ryan Hoffman. Through
the ﬁrst two periods, Manson and Hoffman ex-
changed controls and reversals several times and

. entered the third period tied, 6-6. Manson. started
down to begin the period and broke free to go up

7-6. From then on Manson was in control, open-
ing a lead before pinning Hoffman with 0:19
remaining. Manson was beaten in the champi-
onship semiﬁnals by the eventual champion,
SVU’s Pete Rose, 7-2. Manson rebounded with
two more victories, both by a pin in under two
minutes, to take third place. Lawrence pinned
Waynesburg’s Kevin Walsh in 1:59 and then
pinned teammate freshman Keith Jaworski in
1:58 to take third place.

Adamson also tallied a third—place victory
for the Generals. After breezing past Scranton’s
Luke Genovese 9-2, Adamson fell 6-3 to Wash-
ington and Jefferson’s Chris Price. Adamson
then defeated two teammates, sophomores Rich-
ard Knack and Jon Brown, to win the consola-
tion ﬁnals of the 184-pound class.

Christopher also ﬁnished with a 3-1 record
for the Generals. After winning his opening
match against Muhlenberg’s Billy Sholly, he
was pinned in the championship semis by Wash-
ington and Jefferson’s Alex Cressley. After se-
curing a 10-1 major decision in a dominating
performance against Scranton’s Joe Williams,
Christopher bested Sholly again to take third in
the 197-pound class.

The Generals will return to action next week-
end when they host a tournament featuring Ste-
vens Tech, King’s Point and McDaniel.

Women break even in ODAC play

By Russ Weems
surr wnmzn

The women’s basketball team had an important week,
facing two tough conference opponents. They took on
last year’s ODAC runner-up Virginia Wesleyan on Tues-
day and Roanoke College on Friday.

The women started out with a tough match-up against
the Virginia Wesleyan Marlins. The Generals were
plagued by a slow start, shooting 22.2% (6 out of 27) in
the ﬁrst half. At the break, the Generals trailed the Marlins
by a score of 27-16. After the half, W&L came out ener-
gized and scored the ﬁrst three baskets, cutting the lead to
27-22. The Generals kept ﬁghting and trailed by only six
points on three occasions. They could not pull any closer
though as the Marlins pulled away to tally a 52-38 vic-
tory. The Generals had a tough time stopping the Marlins’
two starting forwards, Heather Phillips and Taylor Lowe,
who scored a combined 25 points. However, the Gener-
als did» have some strong individual performances in the
defeat. Sophomore center Kaitlyn Camp tallied a double-
double with 10 points and 12 boards. Junior forward Kara
Nadeau had 8 points to go along with 8 rebounds. Fresh-
man guard Allie Long provided 9 points in the effort. The
loss dropped the Generals to 2-3 in ODAC play.

The Generals posted a strong away win against the
Maroons of Roanoke College on Friday. The women
would have to overcome a large deﬁcit to win as they
again started out cold. The General again shot 22.2% in
the ﬁrst half. They trailed by as many as 15 in the ﬁrst
and trailed by 12 (30-18) at half. For most of the second
half, the Generals could not do much to crack into this
lead. With just 6:30 remaining, the Generals were down
by 13. It was going to take a special performance by the
Generals to come back, and they had one. The Generals
ratcheted up the defense, holding the Maroons to only one
basket for the rest of the game. W&L outscored Roanoke
19-2 in the ﬁnal 6:30. This end-of-the-game domination
was a total team effort. Freshman guard Allie long led
the run with nine pointsvin the stretch. Junior guard Beth-
any Ridenhour provided a couple of clutch three-point-
ers in the ﬁnal 90 seconds. The win was sealed for the
Generals by a couple of free throws by senior forward
Amanda Kane with 13 seconds left. The Generals more
than doubled their low 22 percent ﬁrst-half shooting with
a 52 percent mark in the second. W&L had a strong per-
formance on the boards, out-rebounding Roanoke 42-33.
Many Generals had strong contributions to the win. Allie
Long had 13 points and 4 assists. Senior forward Kris-
ten Krouchick had 11 points and 6 boards. Amanda Kane
and Bethany Ridenhour both added 8 points. Overall, the
women are now 3-3 in ODAC competition and 4-7 overall
and looking to carry the momentum of this win into the
rest of conference play.

The Generals will return to action away against the
Eastern Mennonite Royals at 7:00 on Tuesday, Jan 15.

Decorated athletes escape consequences

ByAdam Lewis
COLUMNIST

To a lot of people,‘ the symbol of
an asterisk (*) is just that-—a symbol:
A meaningless representation of some
seemingly notable words or numbers
about which no one actually cares.
Let’s face it, the asterisk’s value in our
society can be summed up by its lo-
cation on your keyboard, and the fact
that it takes holding down the “Con-
trol” and “8” keys just to access it.
However, recent events in sports have
led me to place this trivial little symbol
in higher regard than a Dave Monroe
article in The Trident.

This past year’s revelations of the
“Spygate” scandal in the NFL and the
“Mitchell Report” in baseball serve as
the basis for my newfound emphasis
on the asterisk. And it should be not-
ed, (perhaps with an “*”), that I am not
naive enough to believe these cases to
be the only ones Worth highlighting;
they. just happen to be the only docu-
mented instances that merit an asterisk
in my mind.

To thosejofyou who are unfamil-
iar with what sports people are calling
“Spygate,” the term refers to the guilt
of the New England Patriots orga-
nization in the spying of opponents’
sideline signals. Though the Patriots
claim this illegal act to be prevalent
throughout the league, they have been
the only team caught and penalized for
it. Oh, and by penalized, I mean «they
surrendered the worse of their two ﬁrst
round draft picks and a few hundred
thousand dollars. In a league where
anything less than six ﬁgures means as
much as Tony Romo to Jessica Simp-
son, this “punishment” is merely a
false start worth ﬁve yards to a team
already up by 40 points in the fourth
quarter. In other words, it’s a slap on
the wrist.

Tell me something, Mr. Commis-
sioner (and I apologize to any rela-
tives who may be reading this). How
is it that the Patriots get off this easily
when they are the ﬁrst team to go un-
defeated in a 16-game season and they
are going for their fourth Super Bowl
this decade? If you ask me, I have no
problem holding “Ctrl-8” and typing
an asterisk next to not only this sea-

_ son, but to all of their Super Bowls. I

mean, the Patriots are proven cheat-
ers, and no one cheats just once if they
continue to get away with it. They
should be counting their blessings that
they even get to keep their rings. Hey
Coach Belichick, put that and your
oversized sweatshirt in your pipe and
smoke it.

Speaking of cheaters, Senator
George Mitchell disclosed one or two
in his report last month. Within the
report, there are ﬁles on 83 current,
and retired baseball players who are
alleged users of human growth hor-
mones or anabolic steroids. And ex-
perts say that this only scratches the
surface of steroid use in baseball over
the past twenty years.

So far, some players have openly

‘ denied any truth to these reports, some_
have admitted to minor use of men- -

tioned supplements, and still others
have yet to speak out, probably be-
cause the steroids have caused their
mouth muscles to be too big to talk.
As far as I’m concerned, the factual
evidence of this report is overwhelm-
ingly blatant, and Bud Selig should
warm up his ﬁngers for a great deal
of asterisk typing. One may argue that
the extent of a player’s use of either
HGH or steroids could be insigniﬁ-
cant, but the lack of an asterisk next
to the statistics of these guilty players
severely hurts those who are innocent.
Now, barring a similar future report,
players like Greg Maddux who have
been overshadowed by cheaters such
as Roger Clemens will gain the recog-
nition they deserve in the form of as-
terisk-free statistics.

With the path that modern-day
sports are taking, it won’t be long be-
fore the asterisk gets a key of its own
on your keyboard. As long as Barry
Bonds hoists the Home Run crown
above his steroid-induced head and
Bill Belichick’s hand is worth more
than a small country’s GDP, this era in
sports will be known as the Age of the
Asterisk. And hey, with the rising rate
of Adderall use among college stu-
dents, I wouldn’t be surprised to see
GPAs with little asterisks next to them
saying “Student used performance-en-
hancing drugs.”

Generals huddle to congratulate Marymount and Wingate after Saturday's home meet.

Relay secures Victory

Men dominate Marymount, squeeze by Wingate; women end meet at 1-]

By Michael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee
men’s and women’s swim-
ming teams returned to action
for the ﬁrst time following
their annual winter training
trip as they took on Wing-
ate and Marymount. For the
men, it was a chance to see
how they stacked up against a
Wingate team that nearly took
the Bluegrass Mountain Con-
ference title from them last
year. In a thrilling ﬁnale, the
men won the meet in the ﬁnal
relay and beat Wingate 133-
129. The women fell to Wing-
ate 160-101, but both teams
beat Marymount; the men by
a 222-37 score and the women
by 184.5-70.5.

The men trailed most of the
meet and were down by nine
points with just three events
remaining, the 100 butterﬂy,
200 individual medley and
400 free relay. Led by sopho-
more Josh Gonzalez, the Gen-
erals dominated the 100 ﬂy
taking ﬁrst, third and fourth.
Gonzalez touched the wall in
53.26, just 0. 14 seconds ahead
of Wingate sophomore Scott
Stevens. Freshman Brandon

Wilder and sophomore Win-
ston Stagg also ﬁnished in un-
der 54 seconds to secure third
and fourth and tie the meet
113-113 with two events to
go. Wingate regained the led

alter the 200 IM with sopho-'

more Kyle Corcoran’s win.

With only one event re-
maining, the men trailed by
ﬁve points. If the Generals won
the ﬁnal relay, the meet would
be tied. If they could take ﬁrst
and third, the meet was theirs.
Though the Generals’ top re-
lay of seniors Tim McGlaston
and Alex Sweet, junior Brett
Tatman and sophomore Bran-
don Bamds jumped out to a
commanding early lead that
was never challenged, the bat-
tle for third place remained in
doubt. After the ﬁrst two legs,
sophomores Nick Talluri and
Jonathan Giesen had opened
a second-and-a-half lead over
Wingate’s B team in the battle
for third. Swimming third,
Gozalez more than doubled
the lead to over three seconds
and junior Chris Diebold an-
chored to secure third place
and the team victory for the
Generals.

The win was a total team
effort. The duo of Sweet and

McGlaston dominated the
sprint freestyle events for the
Generals ﬁnishing ﬁrst and
second in both the 50 free
and the 100 free. Sweet won
the 50 free in 20.80 with Mc-
Glaston just a tenth of a sec-
ond behind. Sweet then picked
up his second individual vic-
tory of the day when he bested
McGlaston by half a second
in the 100 free, ﬁnishing in
a time of 46.75. Senior Will
Hartman also chipped in a win
in the 100 backstroke.

On the women’s side, ju-
nior Lindsey Strachan and
freshman Tess Hayden led
the way with two individual
victories each. Strachan won
both backstroke events, the
100 back in a time of 1:02.03
and the 200 back in a time of
2:12.63. Hayden took ﬁrst in
the 1000 free, ﬁnishing the last
100 over three seconds faster
than Wingate’s Sarah Erickson
to win in a time of 11:04.57.
Hayden also won the 500
freestyle in 5:24.49. Freshman
Jackie Smith won the 200 free
in a time of2:01.33.

With the wins, the men
improve to 9-0 this season
and the women’s record sits
at 7-5. Next up for the women

is a trip to defending ODAC
champion Randolph-Macon
for a dual meet on Jan. 18.
The men don’t return to action
until they host Johns Hopkins
for two-day duel on Jan. 25
and 26 in what will likely be
their toughest test of the regu-
lar season.

Men’s bball makes habit of Winning

Loss to Roanoke ends four-game winning streak, but team is still 6-5

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington & Lee
men’s basketball team is on
a role, extending its win-
ning streak to four games this
week.

A 71-64 home loss to Roa-
noke halted that streak Sunday,
as Roanoke pulled away in the
second half despite 28 points
from Greg Bienemann.

The game was tied at half-
time, but the Generals went
cold in the second half, hitting
just two of their 14 three-point
attempts.

Since losing to conference-
rival Virginia Wesleyan over a
month ago, the Generals have
hit their stride as they head
into conference play. W&L
won its own tournament over
Winter Break and defeated
Goucher College on the road
before beginning the heart of
its schedule.

The win against Eastern
Mennonite University on
Wednesday marked the ﬁrst
four-game winning streak for
the program since the 1989-
1990 season. Coach Adam
Hutchinson credits better ex-
ecution and cohesion for the
team’s success.

“Our offensive execution
has improved since the be-
ginning of the season,” said
Hutchinson. “We seem to
have greater trust in each other
and are more willing to share
the ball.”

On Wednesday, W&L
opened the contest against
Eastern Mennonite with two
quick layups by senior captain
Femi Kusimo to take a quick

ly narrowed the gap to two
points, 17-15, at the midway
point in the ﬁrst half. W&L
went on some small scoring
runs, but Eastern Mennonite
was right there to counter.
W&L built an 11-point lead
on a layup by senior captain
Bienemann with roughly ﬁve
minutes left in the ﬁrst half.
Junior Ryan Owens also con-
tributed to the highlight reel

“Our offensive execution has improved

since the beginning of the season. We seem

to have greater trust in each other and are

more willing to share the ball. ”

4-0 advantage. The Royals did
not score until three minutes
into the game which is a testa-
ment to the Generals defense.
During the_ winning streak,
W&L has held all of their op-
ponents to under 70 points.

Seven minutes into the
game, the Generals had a com-
manding 10-point lead, which
included a dunk by sophomore
Zac White.

However, the Royals quick-

with a dunk of his own. The
team took control from then
on and ended the ﬁrst half up
42-35.

The Generals came out ﬁr-
ing in the second half the same
way they did in the ﬁrst with
a layup by Kusimo. The team
continued to distance them-
selves over their opponent,
increasing the lead to 16 at the
ﬁve-minute mark into the sec-
ond half.

The Royals answered with
a 9-0 run, but W&L countered
with an impressive 13-0 run of
its own, making the score 70-
50. Fellow captains Kusimo
and Bienemann combined for
10 of the 13 points during the
scoring run. The team went
into cruise control after that,
winning the game 79-65.

Bienemann and Kusimo
combined for a staggering 45
points in the win, including a
season-best 21 pointslby Kusi-
mo. Junior Kirk Jones also
added 11 points in the effort.

Kusimo attributed his and
Bienemann’s success to strong
guard play.

“Greg and 1 were able to
be so effective against EMU
because they had to respect
the shooters on our team so it
gave us room to work,” Kusi-
mo said.

He also said that defense
and ‘working as a team are piv-
otal in marinating success.

“For the winning streak
to continue, we have to keep
playing tough defense and
keep playing unselﬁshly on
offense.”

Washington & Lee is now
6-4 overall and 2-1 in confer-
ence as the team begins a 15-
game in-conference stretch.
