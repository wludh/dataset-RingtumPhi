Charlie McDowell
Speaks On Politics

Mr. Charles McDowell, Jr.
a nationally syndicated colum-
ist, will speak here Monday,
March 16 in Lee Chapel at
7:30. The subject of his lec-
ture will be “Virginia Politics.”

Immediately following this speech,
Mr. McDowell will hold a discussion
on “trends and power blocs in Vir-
ginia politics.” This discussion will
be held in Room 8 of Newcomb
Hall, and all interested students are
invited ‘to attend.

Mr. McDowell’s column, carried
by the Richmond Times-Dispatch, is
distributed nationally by the Regis-
ter and Tribune Syndicate. His col-
umn concentrates on Washington
and national politics but also covers

 

 

 

Charles McDowell, Jr.

domestic problems, the arts, national
fads, and folkways of Madison Av-
enue and Surburbia from a humor-
ous point of view.

In 1959, he won the Distinguished
Service Award at the Southern In-
terscholastic Press Association’s
thirtieth convention. In 1960, he
won the National Headliner’s Award
for the most humorous column.

Besides his newspaper work, Mr.

McDowell has had two collections of
his columns published in book form.
The first was One Thing After An-
Other, published in 1960, and the
second, What Did You Have in
Mind?, published in 1963.

Mr. MeDowell’s father is a Pro-
fessor of Law at W&L, and Mr.
McDowell himself is a graduate of
W&L. He attended W&L imme-
diately following the close of World
War II, and in his freshman year
began writing for The Columns, the
W&L newspaper at that time. His
sophomore year, he became editor
of this publication. When the Ring-
tum Phi came back into existence
his junior year, he wrote a column
on this publication also. This same

 

year, he worked on the Calyx staff,
was an Executive Committee mem-
ber, and wrote for the Southern
Collegian. Mr. McDowell, in his sen-
ior year was elected president of
the Publication Board. He was also
a member of the Washington and
Lee Literary Society, and of the Edi-
torial Board.

After attending Columbia School
of Journalism, Mr. McDowell joined
the Times Dispatch as a reporter
and in 1956, he was given a column.
As a reporter, he toured the country
with Khrushchev and also covered
the national political conventions.

Mr. McDowell’s talk is being joint-
ly sponsored by Colonel Gilliam of
VMI, and Dr. Colvin of W&L, under
the auspices of the NCEP, the Na-
tional Committee for Education in
Politics. This is a nonpartisan or-
ganization supported by a Ford
Foundation grant, the purpose of
which is to interest students in
practical polities.

Mr. McDowell was scheduled to
speak at W&L last November 25,
but because of the President’s as-
sassination his lecture was postponed.

Debaters Lose
In Navy Meet

The Washington and Lee Debate
Team suffered defeat last week
at the Annapolis Tournament, spon-
sored by the U.S. Naval Academy.
The team composed of sophomore
Sam Frazier and freshman Bill
Grant won victories over the Uni-
versity of Maryland and St. Joseph’s
while losing to the universities of
Georgia and South Carolina, St.
John’s, and Eastern Nazarine.

The Annapolis Tournament is
the 13th this year for the Debate
Team. Forty-one students have
participated in these tournaments
this year, and 40-50 more have
taken part in practice dual de-
bates with other Virginia colleges,
marking the greatest number of
W&L students to participate in
forensic activities in recent years.

 

There are about four more tour-
naments remaining this school year.
Today Ed Fitzgerald, John McMurry,
Alan Cohen, and Tabor Novak left
for the Georgetown Invitational
Tournament in Washington.

Despite the losing record suffered
by the team in its tournament last
wekend, Director of Forensics Wil-
liam C. Chaffin pointed out, the
debate team is enjoying another
winning season.

In addition to a successful over-
all average, the debaters have won
several meets outright, as well as
earning a number of individual
awards. The record is especially
bright in consideration of the fact
that many freshmen were used.

Sam Goldwyn
Talks At WGL,
Shows New Film

By SYDNEY LEWIS

University of Virginia graduate
Samuel Goldwyn, Jr., and Cavalier
English professor, Dr. Garret spoke
before a movie-going Washington
and Lee audience Thursday night.

Goldwyn, son of ithe famous direc-
tor-producer, Samuel Goldwyn, Sr.,
started his career as a producer of
documentary films for NATO; how-
ever, in recent years he has followed

film, The Young Lovers, was shown
at the State Theatre late Thursday
night.

Goldwyn’s lecture centered around
his new film which is a love episode
involving college students.
wyn stated that in this movie he

a responsible person, not the usual
beatnik, pervert, or  lackadasical
person he is usually depicted as.
Moreover, Goldwyn mentioned that
he tried to distinguish the difference
between love and sex in his new
cinema.

Goldwyn revealed that the movie
is based on a poor novel adapted
for the screen by Dr. Garrett, and
its theme, that “love cannot totally
exist without self commitment,” re-
mains the underlying theme of the
movie. The novel was unacceptable
in its original version because of its
lack of action and poor dramatiza-
tion. However, Garrett, whom Gold-
wyn first became acquainted with
after reading his book, King on the
Mountain, was able to convert the
book into workable flick.

Goldwyn said that his major prob-
lem after beginning to rewrite the
novel was to find acceptable actors
to portray the characters. After see-
ing Peter Fonda in a movie in New
York, Fonda was signed; however,
the role of the lover opposite Fonda
presented a more formidable prob-
lem and finally an unknown star
was caste.

After the lecture, Goldwyn ac-
cepted questions from the audience.
In his answers he stated such facts
that even an inexpensive movie
costs around $750,000, and also tried
to explain the difference between
American and European color in
films.

Also, he was questioned on the
function of a producer and explained
that a movie to him was like a book
to an author and that he must be
absolute manager of the film to feel
that he has produced a work of his
own.

This morning, Goldwyn spoke at
the 9:20 Journalism course, “An In-
troduction ‘to the Motion Picture.”
The class was essentially a question
and answer session with the topic
of discussion being The Young
Lovers.

National Science Foundation Grants

12-Inch Reflecting Telescope To Physics

By TOM DAVIS

Last year two money grants were
made to the Washington and Lee
University Department of Physics
to provide new laboratory equip-
ment,

A grant of $15,000 from the Atomic
Energy Commission has enabled the
Physics Department to purchase
radio-active isotopes and _ several
laboratory instruments used in radi-
ation experiments. The new equip-
ment is now being used by students
enrolled in Nuelear Physics 212, a
course that is new this year to the
curriculum,

In addition to instruments that de-
tect and count atomic emissions, the
Nuclear Physics Lab is equiped with
a neutron accelerator called a Neu-
tron Howitzer. The Neutron How-
itzer is used to radio-activate thin
strips of metal foil which are needed
in radiation experiments. It con-
sists of a large tank of water in the
center of which is placed a core of
radioactive material; this radioactive
source emits neutrons traveling at
high speeds.

The neutrons must be slowed
down in order for them to activate
the metal foils. For that reason the
neutrons are directed through the
water which tends to retard their

speed. In some experiments the
Howitzer operator may wish to di-
rect a beam of fast moving neu-
trons in which case he adjusts the
instrument so that the neutrons are
projected through an empty tublar
channel instead of through water.

Mr. William Barlow Newbolt, a
graduate of Berea College in Ken-
tucky and instructor of Nuclear
Physics 212, says that careful pre-
cautions must be taken in the lab-
oratory to guard oneself against
harmful radiation. The laboratory
is equipped with blocks of lead
which are used to sheild the obser-
ver from his experiment.

A generous grant frora the Na-
tional Science Foundation has en-
abled the Physics Department to
purchase a twelve inch Newtonian-
Cassegrain reflecting telescope.

In October the telescope was in-
stalled under the astro-dome on
top of the New Science Building.
Dr. Edward Turner, Professor of
Physics who teaches the astronomy
courses at W&L, Physics 202, says
that the new telescope replaces a
five inch reflector made by a former
proefssor here.

The old scope was cumbersome
and had no permanent mounting.
When it was used it had to be car-

 

ried by two men through an open
window onto the roof of Reid Hall
where it was placed upon a tripoid.
The new twelve inch reflector has a
permanent equatorial mounting.

The telescope is driven by a mor-
tor on the mounting so that it com-
pensates for apparent star movement
and keeps an observed object with-
in it field view at all times. The
New Science Buidlding observatory
is also equipped with two refractor
finder scopes which are used to
locate objects for the main scope,
and a guide telescope which is used
to keep the ‘twelve inch reflector ac-
curately on target when lengthy
time photographs are being taken
through it.

Now on display in the New Sci-
ence Building is a series of photo-
graphs showing several stages in
the lunar eclipse of last December.
Dr. Turner used the twelve inch
reflector to take the photographs.

It is important when making as-
tronomical observations to note the
accurate time of one’s observations.
Dr. Turner reports that the Physics
Department will soon install a short
wave radio to receive time signals
from station WWV in Washington,
D.C., and will also install a pendulum
clock to check time measurements.

Application For 1964
Records New High

By HARRY KUHNER

The Committee of Aidmissions is
now in the process of considering
for acceptance the largest number
of freshman applications ever sub-
mitted.

As of February 15, reported Dean
James Farrar, 1450 completed ap-
plications had been submitted, ap-
proximately 200 more than last year.
Dean Farrar also stated that be-
tween 550 and 600 will be offered ac-
ceptances for the 330-member fresh-
man class and that notification of
acceptance will be sent out starting
now, and continuing through the
spring until the deadline for the
candidate’s reply date, May 1. No
potential freshman is required to
inform the University of his ac-
ceptance until that time.

According to Dean Lewis John,
Director of Financial Aid, approx-
imately 250 of the 1450 applicants
have asked for financial assistance.
Of this 250, 120 have already been
offered acceptances. Dean John
stated, however, that not all of these
will need financial aid.

Dean John said that Scholarship
Weekend will determine the recipi-
ents of the Robert E. Lee and George
F. Baker scholarships. About 30
semi-finalists for these scholarships
will be interviewed on March 20
and 21 by two separate committees.
The Faculty Committee on Schol-
arships will interview all applicants
on Friday, March 20, and the fol-
lowing day, a three-man committee
from the Board of Trustees will in-
terview the semi-finalists for the
Baker scholarships. The finalists for
the Baker scholarships will be
chosen directly by this committee,
but the Lee scholarship finalists will
be determined by the Faculty Com-
mittee on the basis of these inter-
views.

The group of potential freshmen is
felt to be an extremely strong one
in respect to qualifications. Dean
Farrar feels that this is due to the
fact that college guidance in the

 

GILLIAM AWARD

The E.C. is now receiving nom-
inations for this year’s recipient of
the Dean Frank J. Gilliam Award,
given annually to a student who
has made an outstanding contri-
bution to the University in an ex-
tracurricular activity.

Nominations must be submitted
no later than March 23,

NATIONAL DEFENSE GRANTS

The new booklet containing a
listing of National Defense Grad-
uate Fellowships for 1964-65 is
now available for consultation
in Dean Pusey’s office. Students
interested in obtaining a doctorate
for an academic career of teach-
ing at higher institutions are giv-
en preference.

The Fellowships, which are com-
petitive, are available in such
fields as English, foreign lan-
guages, philosophy, area studies,
economics, history, political sci-
ence, sociology, psychology, natur-
al sciences, and mathematics.

high and preparatory schools has
been improving so as to persuade the
prospective freshman to apply to a
school suitable to his capacity as a
student. He also stressed the point
that the competition is becoming
keener.

He feels that there are two phases
of this competition: first, the student
that applies to W&L has, on the
average, applied to three other col-
leges; and second, the University
itself is striving to seek a degree of
excellence which forces its appli-
cants to be better prepared for col-
lege. This competition, coupled with
the fact that the number of college
applications is increasing each year,
will provide a better academic en-
vironment at W&L in the years to
come, he stated.

Richmond Editor
To Speak Here.

James Kilpatrick, editor of the
Richmond News Leader, will speak
at Washington and Lee under the
sponsorship of the Department of
Journalism on March 18 at 8 p.m.
in duPont Auditorium.

He will concern himself with po-
tential problems of the next twenty
or thirty years brought about by
governmental policies and the pop-
ulation explosion, conservative pol-
icies, responsibility, and principles
applying to the problems of change.

Recently, he has discussed racial
problems and his views on them
with CORE director James Farmer,
and on television, with Negro rights
leader Martin Luther King.

On this campus his arguments
have been both attacked and sup-
ported in the Ring-tum Phi through
letters, editorials, and articles. He
is noted for his representation of
the segregationalist South, and his
opposition to Federal intervention in
state affairs.

Kilpatrick was born in Oklahoma
City in 1920, attended both elemen-
tary and high school there, and gra-
duated from the University of Min-
nesota in 1941 with a Bachelor of
Journalism degree.

In the same year he began work-
ing for the News Leader, covering
State and Federal courts and offices.
In 1949, under Dr. Douglass South-
all Freeman, Kilpatrick became asso-
ciate editor of the News Leader, and
in June of the same year he be-
came editor upon Freeman’s retire-
ment.

He has been honored by the Uni-
versity of Missouri for distinguished
service in Journalism, as a_ result
of an editorial campaign to release
a Negro mistakenly convicted and
sentenced to life for murder.

For an editorial campaign in sup-
port of the doctrine of interposition,
the honorary journalism fraternity
Sigma Delta Chi awarded him its
annual prize for distinguished edi-
torial writing in 1956. In 1955-56

The appointment of six vice pres-
idents for Spring Dances was an-
nounced today by Steve Smith,
president of the dance set. It was
also announced that Dr. Feelgood
and the Interns will appear at the
Springs Cocktail Party which will
open the weekend on Friday, April
Lf,

The vice presidents, all juniors,
are Andy Carothers, Walter Bennett,
Brooks Brown, Bill Price, Jim Slay,
and Duke Terrell.

Carothers, an SAE, is vice presi-
dent of publicity for the dance set.
He is vice president of his fraternity
and a member of the Mongolian
Minks, WSCF, and the Advisory
Council.

Bennett is a Sigma Nu and will be

4in charge of the figure. He is a

Dean’s List student, Robert E. Lee
Research Scholar, chairman of the
Massachusetts delegation for the
Mock Convention, and is a member
of the Library Committee.

Brown, a Kappa Sig, will handle
the cocktail party. He is vice pres-
ident of his fraternity, secretary of
the junior class, secretary of the
International Relations Club, and a
member o fthe Dance Board Ad-
visory Committee. Brown also was
sophomore class secretary, Out-
standing Freshman his first year,
and played varsity baseball.

Price, an SAE, is vice president
in charge of invitations to the dance
set. He is a member of the “Thir-
teen” Club, the Student Service So-
ciety, and the varsity lacrosse team.

Slay is a Delt and will handle
decorations in the gym for the week-
end. President of his fraternity, as
well as of the House Managers’
Association, Slay is also a member
of the Cold Check Committee, the
Dance Board Advisory Committee,
and the lacrosse team.

Terrell, KA, is vice president in
charge of coordination of the var-
ious phases of the dance set. He is
house manager-treasurer of his fra-
ternity, played varsity soccer, and
holds a McElwee Grant Scholarship.

Smith also stated that last year’s
format for the Spring weekend
would be used again. Last year, for
the first time, the old formula of a
dance and a concert was replaced by
two concerts, both held in Doremus
Gym.

The dates of the two concerts are
April 17 and 18. Both concerts are
expected to be held in the evening.
Music for the two nights will in-
clude jazz and rock and roll, ac-
cording to the Springs president.

The cocktail party will be an out-
side affair, but the location is un-
determined as yet. In case of rain
the Moose Lodge will be the alter-
nate location of the cocktail party.

Dr. Feelgood and the Interns, who
will entertain at the cocktail party,
have been one of the most popular
groups at Washington and Lee for
several years and have established
a national reputation for their hit
records as well as for their campus
appearances.

Assimilation Committee
Defines Policy on Dress

In order to clarify several mis-
conceptions of what is and what is
not conventional dress, the Assimi-
lation Committee publishes the fol-
lowing guidelines, which are elect-
ed examples and certainly not all
inclusive ones.

Conventional dress includes: Sport
or suit coats and ties, slacks, W&L
monogram cardigans, shirts of sub-
dued colors, sweaters and vests, pro-
vided coats and ties are still worn.

Conventional dress does not in-
clude: Sport shirts, such as madras

.or plaid, sneakers, jeans of any
color, winter coats (overcoats, ski
parkas, ete.) in place of sport or
sult coats.

Inasmuch as the above are only
guidelines, the decision of what con-
stitutes conventional dress, or, per-

haps a better term, dress befitting
a gentleman, and when it should be
worn, can sensibly be left only to

judgment of the Assimilation

Student Lashes Out At Flournoy’s ‘Humorous’ Letter

Editor, Ring-tum Phi

I just want to congratulate Dan
Flournoy in public for showing that
he is an open-minded individual. It

this semester showing interest in an

him whatsoever. But Mr. Flournoy

would worry about Mr. Flournoy

Sexual Revolution—Part Ill

 

Flaws Cited In ‘Playboy’ Sex Philosophy

In the true style of Ellery Queen
and Alfred Hitchcock, we have
embodied our third and final “epi-
sode” with a bit of a surprise
ending. The position we are taking
in our concluding remarks below
are in direct contradistinction to
the sand which our first two in-
stallments presented. Our policy
so far has been to affirm to the
readers at large exactly what they
wanted to hear; thus, the “free
love” philosophy and the Playboy
credo have been merely a subter-
fuge to attract attention to a per-
tinent and critical issue. Having
enticed the herd with this sugar-
coated surface, we now, however,
shall disclose some of the bitter
realities about our topic sex.

By KEN LANE
Editor-in-Chief

In its demogogic manner , the
Playboy philosophy of Hugh Hefner
eee , and disciples has
m | challenged college

students to bring
|| the subject of sex
', unabashedly _ into
the open. It has
done so by ridi-
culing the absurd
extremes to which
conservative fac-
‘tions such as the
church have gone
in their effort to
suppress anything
at all associated with sexual be-
havior. On tthe other hand, these
philosophers have followed up their
iconoclasm by jumping to an oppo-
site and equally perverted extreme—
that of dissolving sex taboos alto-
gether.

Lane

The Playboy credo is not neces-
sarily antimoral; to the contrary, it
in many ways fills a gap that the
ivory tower moralist has overlooked.
For it directs society not to con-
form to morality merely for the sake
of morality or for fear of public
censure, but to be open-minded and
free-thinking. It rebels against out-
dated social rules and sentiments
which limit our freedom ‘to be in-
diivduals. It challenges us to look
beyond mores and folkways, em-
ploying the question “Why?” as a
tool for deeper probing.

Where Playboy poses its great-
est threat is not in its antimoral-
ism, but in its antisexuality. Com-
menting on this flaw, critic Harvey
Cox in the journal Christianity
and Crises, states that Playboy
and its imitators “dilute and dis-

sipate authentic sexuality by re-
ducing it to an accessory, by keep-
ing at a safe distance....We must
see in Playboy the latest and
slickest episode in man’s continu-
ing refusal to be fully human,”
For in its “idealism” toward sex,
the Playboy philosophy has run into

several fallacies. First of all, in much |

the same way that we have done in

our previous installments, Hefner
is projecting in his philosophy intel-
lectual arguments in support of what
the masses want to hear, and this in
large part explains the basis of his
popularity. In a society of perfect,
rational persons, the freedom Hef-
ner advocates is plausible. But there
is a difference between using free-
dom to lead better lives and free-
dom to justify the life one wants to
lead, and men commonly and con-
veniently confuse this distinction.

 

Secondly, by its emphasis on
spontaneity as opposed to self-re-
straint, the Playboy philosophy as-
sumes a precarious foundation. If
we make every decision in favor of
our natural inclinations, this would
mean going to the movies or tzavel-
ing “down the road” whenever the
impulse hits us. As rational indivi-
duals, we inevitably confront sit-
uations that demand self-control, our
self-denial of the “natural,” the
spontaneous, for what will in the

 

end mean more to us. If we didn’t
act this way, we would not be free;
we would be slaves to our every
whim and desire.

Would repression of our sex
drive lead to frustration and per-
version? The psychologist says no.
By a process called sublimation,
our sex-derived energies can be
constructively channeled in aven-
ues other than physical expression.
There are any number of gen-

Student’s Inquiry Clears Doctor’s Name

By N. E. Personne

A few days ago, it was my mis-
fortune to overhear some malcontent
refer to our beloved campus physi-
cian as a “quack vetenarian.” As be-
fitting any high-minded man and
citizen, I was outraged and indig-
nant at this insidious insult to the
professional felicity of our noble
doctor, this paragon of medical
knowledge, this tireless worker who
has never once been known to ab-
sent himself from the environs of
the school infirmary. My patriotic
duty as a gentleman and scholar
called—I immediately began an in-
vestigation to clear forever any
shadow of disrepute surrounding the
name of our learned doctor. The
results, manifestedly successful, are
recorded below.

Faith Confirmed

I was first granted the honor of
an audience with the great man
himself. Entering the physician’s of-
fice, I was ushered into his presence
after a wait of only five hours. The

 

doctor was enshrined between an
ornately carved and painted mask
and some rattles on one side, and a
great boiling cauldron on the other.
On the desk before the throne were
two learned medical treatises: Golf
Made Easy and How to Succeed in
Business Without Really Trying.

The kindly doctor was gracious
enough to immediately confirm my
unwavering belief that he is in-
deed one of the world’s foremost
authorities in the medical profes-
sion. With this unimpeachable
first-hand testimony, there was
obviously no need for further en-
quiry, but knowing the depraved
opinions of many so-called stu-
dents at W&L, I persisted.

The doctor was so kind as to
show me his renowned preventative
and cure for all diseases known to
man or beast—Prof. Barnum’s Pe-
troleum Snake Oil. Right on the
label of this wonderful bottle of es-
sence was authoritatively listed just
a few of the ailments instantly

 

cured by the contents: poison ivy,
the common cold, hypochondria, hy-

drophobia, diarrhea, pneumonia,
constipation, measles, hoof and
mouth disease, tapeworms, and

housemaid’s knee.

To forever shatter the malignant
rumor that he is a graduate of the
third-rate Abbsynia Institute of
Medicine, the physician showed me
his diploma from the Mount Zion
School of Pharmaceutics and Faith
Healing.

Mental Acuteness Revealed

Our school physician’s great psy-
chological acuteness in ferreting out
hypochondriacs was brilliantly dem-
onstrated the other day. Another
student, obviously of a deceitful and

Impressions Of Student Body Expressed By Dr. Duvall

Editor’s note: The following article by
Dr. Severn P. C. Duvall is based on a
speech he gave before a meeting of the
Lynchburg alumni on February 19.

As for our students—I find them on the
average a very good lot, well up the scale of
ability even if our college board scores show
us to be below the level of our
peer institutions northeast and
midwest. In my own area of
} competence I have found their
work — their themes—to be
generally as good as those of
freshmen elsewhere. I gave no
more A’s before than I do
here and about the same per-
centage of C’s. I am delighted
to find myself back in a re-
spected and operative honor system embraced
by the students and run by them. I am pleased
also by their manners, by their engaging
friendliness, and by their responsiveness in
personal contact. I think I have never known,
personally, as many undergraduates as I know
here after only two years, and these associa-
tions are invariably satisfying.

   

Duvall

Yet I have other responses which are
somewhat more critical. They come from the
accumulated experience of two years only, a
fact which may diminish their reliability. But
take them for what they are; they too are im-
pressions.

Homogeneous Student Body

I find the undergraduate body too homo-

geneous, too bland—not a real beatnik in the
lot, no leaven to the mass. I suspect our un-
dergraduates do not easily tolerate, let alone
encourage, a cellist or a poet, a fact inevitably
reaching outward to determine our admissions
profile. Individuality is expressed chiefly in
its social outburst. I find them, from my per-
spective, too conservative. | do not mean this
in its political sense (though the distinctively
conservative bias to their political remarks
may be a factor in the larger view) but in its
intellectual sense. They seem to be, for ex-
ample, lecture-oriented, surely able to repeat
on examination the data fed into them from
textbook and podium. What I miss is the clash
of their opinions, among themselves and with
their instructors. College is their chance, prob-
ably their first and perhaps their last, to test
the radical possibilities of life.

Radical Nature of Youth To Be Expected

Youth is radical by nature—it should be
radical. We older folks timidly watch and
worry at its outbreak in various phases: inde-
pendence in finances, the discoveries of sex
and liquor. We should rather remember the
currents of life, and channel these currents
productively. Where is a better place, when
is a better time, for the plunge into the world’s
body? When and where better to challenge
the world, to boast to the world of one’s self?
Here they may confront undiluted and pure
the concepts on which their physical and cul-
tural lives depend; here they may meet with
men of varying age who, ever young in the

degree of their own continuing challenge, treat
with them as equal selves to explore and dis-
cover. For this reason I sometimes wonder if
we as faculty do not abdicate our true respon-
sibility by standing as we sometimes seem to
so closely in loco parentis—though I suppose
this is a role thrust upon us by some parents
who perhaps conceive of the liberal arts col-
lege as a ‘finishing’ school rather than a “be-
ginning.”

I want my students at W&L to be aware
of the values of the alien world, to grasp the
being of otherness as well as the values of
self. I believe they must confront the world
as individuals, self-dependent, not fraternity—
or family—or tradition-bound to respond in
ways others have prepared and trampled for
them. I want them to face the perils, the risks
of freedom with alert, self-dependent minds
disciplined by their contact with the broad ex-
perience available to them in college. In
talking as an English professor now, for I
mean the broad experience given man in his
literature and history and philosophy. But I
would insist also on the discoveries of the
laboratory as equally releasing. And if I seem
here to contradict myself, if you argue that
such experience must be seen as itself an ac-
cumulated and traditional body of knowl-
edge, I would simply reply to the contrary
that even this is reevaluated from age to age—
provisional at best—for each age must ques-
tion its received traditions in its own present
terms, from its own peculiar perspective. And
those who seem best to survive that question,

in literature at least, are those like Shakes-
peare who represent the world as it is in its
fullest complexity and ambiguity, where ab-
solutes are always shadowed by time.

Responsibility Is in Part To Subvert

As an English teacher I naturally play
with words; remember this when I say that
I feel my responsibility is in part to subvert
or currupt your sons, in the sense of breaking
up the set and inherited ways for reexamina-
tion; and all we can offer them in return are
provisional possibilities. As educators we lead
them out—out of what? Out of the embraces
of protective devices which left unexamined
will inevitably strangle them. We offer them
liberation in a liberal arts college.

And what is our ultimate role—ours,
meaning both mine and yours? We must ac-
cept and encourage their plunge, their dis-
coveries, even at the risk of losing them—ac-
cept it with pride to the ultimate end of their
grace.

Rewards Come Even From the Worst

One is always rewarded as a teacher even
by the worst students I suppose, for one shares
in each discovery. What a life-giving sense it
brings! Always the pride of seeing the mind
make its own break upward and out. In a free
theme from my freshmen last semester I re-
member two impressive examples (neither of
which, I should note, took their immediate
departure from reading assignments in the

In Review

 

Winter Sports Turn in
Poor Seasonal Record

By GUY UNANGST
Friday Sports Editor
All in all, winter sports were pretty much of a flop.
In basketball, wrestling, swimming and rifle, Washington
and Lee’s varsity teams compiled an ignominious 16-30-2 rec-

ord. None were able to win

more than half their games,

 

matches, meets, or what-have you.*

Perhaps the brightest spot during
the long winter was the performance
of coach Joe Lyles’ freshman basket-
ball team. Lyles regards it as one
of the finest he has coached.

The freshmen finished with a 9-3
mark, winning four of their last five
games. The defeat was 84-76 to
Greenbrier Military, in a game
which the freshmen fouled enough
to give their opponents 56 free
throws.

These last five games the team
was without two first semester
starters, Jack Fisher and Howard
Gordy, who had a bit of grade
trouble. Frank Morrison was a
freshman spark plug, averaging 19.3
points a game.

Wrestlers Dissapoint

Along about November, everyone
(well, almost everyone) was talking
about how the wrestling team was
the best ever, might go undefeated
and might (Ye Gads) beat Virginia.
The wrestlers ended up 6-5-1.

Well, they did win half their
matches. and vaunted freshman Dick
Musick did win most of his matches

Halfway through the season, Tom
Stover, one of next’s year’s tri-
captains, had a little bit of grade
trouble (or a whole lot depending
on how you look at it) and was
replaced by Jamie Andrews.

Stover has an overall record of
22-4, Andrews proceeded to win but
two of six matches.

Wrestling fans should console
themselves with the Generals’ 40-0
victory over RPI, and their 37-0
rout of Hampden-Sydney. Oh, inci-
dentally, they didn’t beat Virginia.

Swimmers Split

The W&L swimming team, or
“mermen,” as one edition puts it,
managed to break even, winning
five of their 10 meets.

Coach Norris Eastman said one
week he would be “relying heavily
on nine returning lettermen,” and
then, after Virginia (them again)
beat W&L 62-33, had to blame it
on a “young team.”

The Tuesday Edition (let's come
right out and say it this time) pre-
dicted a winning season for the
swimmers in part two of their
series—“Who to Watch this Winter.”
It’s interesting to note they then
gave up the series.

Their best performance was prob-
ably earlier in the season, in a 49-
46 win over Loyola (Baltimore).
The “mermen” set school records
in the 500 yard freestyle (John
Wolfe), the backstroke (Bill Broad-
dus), the medley relay, and free-
style relay.

Eastman called his medley relay

 

team “his best ever.” They lowered
the old team record eight seconds.
Bart Taylor, Broaddus, John Lifter
and Bill Wildrick compose it.

Basketball Too

At the beginning of the season
coach Bob McHenry said height
would be his basketball team’s big-
gest problem. For more than half
the season the team rebounded as
well as their opponents, but then
height caught up with them.

In the Roanoke game, for instance,
the Generals took but one rebound
off the offensive board in the entire
first half.

McHenry Leaves
Rich Career Here

By BRUCE GARRETT
Friday Sports Writer

When basketball and__ lacrosse
coach Bob McHenry leaves here
at the end of this year, Washington
and Lee will lose a very active par-
ticipant in the sports world.

Moving to Lebanon Valley, where
he will coach the same two sports,
McHenry has been particularly not-
able in his lacrosse achievements.

A 1956 graduate of Washington
and Lee, he played basketball here
for four years and lacrosse during
his last two.

In his senior year he was selected
for honorable mention on the All-
State basketball squad. He also play-
ed on the Southern team in the
North-South All-Star lacrosse game
in Geneva, N. Y. The South won
20-10.

In 1960 he was assistant coach
for the Southern All-Star team
which won 13-12, and in 1961
moved up to head coach, bringing
home a 12-9 victory.

During the summer he joins Coach
Dana Swan and Bob Frost playing
in the major division of the Phila-
delphia Lacrosse club, as close to
professional lacrosse as there is.

When asked about his forthcom-
ing change of tenure, he remarked
that since his brother is currently
coaching at Lebanon Valley and the
school is close to his home, it seemed
an ideal choice when ‘the job of
backetball coach fell vacant.

“Not that the administration and
coaching staff have not been won-
derful to me here,” he is quick to
add, “but I feel the need of a
move, and it is easier to do when
you are still young and single.”

McHenry had no ready explana-
tion as to his interest in two so dif-
ferent sports as lacrosse and basket-
ball, but said lacrosse had probably
been kinder to him. He has been
around the world from England to
Australia and Hawaii with touring
lacrosse squads.

Even though lacrosse has given
him more honors and advantages
than basketball, his major interest
depends on which season he happens
to be in.

It is sincerely hoped the adminis-
tration can select a man able to fill
the vacant post as competently as
has McHenry over the past six years.

 

Bridge Clubs Meet Twice Weekly

By PATTON ADAMS
Friday Sports Writer

For Washington and Lee students
who have aspirations to be another
Charles Goren, the American Con-
tract Bridge Association provides
the perfect opportunity.

Under its auspices duplicate
bridge—the bridge you play for
points instead of money—is offered
from 8 p.m. to midnight each Tues-
day and Friday at the home of Mrs.
L. E. White, 2101 Forest Avenue,
Buena Vista.

The student fee is a nominal
twenty-five cents, except for “Mas-
ter Point Nights,’ when the rate
increases to fifty cents. These are
held the second Tuesday and fourth
Friday of each month.

Two Clubs

Organized in 1957, the club orig-
inally met on Tuesday nights only
but, as interest increased, another
charter was secured to establish the
Friday club. Today the Tuesday club
is known as the Rockbridge Dupli-
cate bridge club and the Friday or-
ganization is called simply the Fri-
day Evening Bridge club.

Mrs. White in an interview stress-
ed that both clubs are “open,” and
that students are welcome to come
either or both nights whenever they
wish.

Usually four to six tables are
played, but Mrs. White hopes to in-
crease the size to eight or ten so
that more Master points can be

awarded. Currently both clubs play
under the Hoyle duplicate method
which awards the winner a fraction
of a Master point, determined by a
formula involving the number of
tables played.

There must be at least three and
one-half tables for anyone to score
Master points, according to the rules
of the American contract Bridge As-
sociation. If six tables are played the
winner receives .30 point. If, on the
other hand, only five tables are
played, the winner receives .25 point.
Second place receives half the
amount of first place, and _ third
place one-third.

Life Masters

A number of Life Masters from
Lynchburg often play in Buena Vis-
ta. To become a Life Master one
must have 300 registered Master
points. Mrs. White has 150.

Several members of ‘the club also
hold good tournament records, Mrs.
White explained. The competition
is, thus, quite rugged.

When asked for a tip to playing,
Mrs. White replied, “The most im-
portant thing for the duplicate
bridge player is to try to figure out
what everybody else has in his
hand.”

IM WEEK

By TOM WHITE
Friday Sports Writer

KA stands today as intramural
wrestling champion for 1963-64. With
only one more tournament match
to be held, it looks as if Sigma Chi
will take second, DU third, and Beta
fourth.

KA picked up the title by virtue
of a 3-0 record. They opened with
a 26-10 victory over Sigma Chi,
and followed up with a 25-12 win
over DU. Then, last night, they
clinched the top spot by overwhelm-
ing Beta, 23-5.

Sigma Chi needs only a victory
in their match Monday with
Beta to clinch the number two po-
sition. While if Beta should win,
there would be a three-way tie for
second place.

In the other tournament matches
held, it was this way:

DU over Beta, 20-11; and Sigma Chi
over DU, 25-15.
* He *

In handball, the mess created by
the three-way tie between KA, Beta,
and Delt has yet to be unscrambled.
In the only game played during
the past week, KA rebounded from
their earlier tournament loss to Beta
and came up the winner.

Still left on the KA _ schedule:
Delt, whom KA defeated earlier in
the tournament competition, 4-1. A
KA victory here would give them
the title, while a Delt win would
probably assure them of the top
spot.

In bowling, tournament action got
underway this past week, with Kap-
pa Sig and Phi Kap coming up the
winners in the opening round.

Kappa Sig took advantage of Tom
Pace’s 203 to topple SAE, 2508-
2288. Phi Kap had a slightly easier
time of it as they defeated Phi Psi,
2374-1815.

Giving the Phi Kap cause a big
boost were Jim Bussart and Bill
Tedards who bowled identical
202 games in the third set.

Next week’s action will find Kap-
pa Sig favored to beat Phi Psi, and

SAE rated a toss up against Phi Kap.

Lacrosse ‘B’

Squad Begins

Thirty candidates for “B” squad
lacrosse appeared Tuesday night at
an arganizational meeting called by
coach Dana Swan.

Swan said he was pleased with
the turn-out but would welcome
any others who wished to play. The
team will play four games this year,
opening April 16 against Augusta
Military.

Most of those signing up for the
team have not had previous lacrosse
experience, but Swan pointed to
the varsity’s co-captains Syd Butler
and Johnny McDaniel, both of whom
learned the sport while playing for
the “B” squad. McDaniel is a strong
candidate for All-American honors
this year.

The team finished last season with
a 3-3 record. The full schedule:
April 16, at A.M.A.; April 24, Wood-
berry Forest; April 30, Virginia
freshmen; May 6 A.M.A.

One change has been made in the
varsity schedule announced last Fri-
day. The site of the May 14 game
against Virginia has been changed
from Lexington to Charlottesville.

 

Interviews Continue

As Twombly Seeks Coach

Two men have been interviewed
concerning coach Bob McHenry’s
vacated job as basketball and la-
crosse coach.

Athletic director E. P. “Cy” Twom-
bly said the interviews were con-
tinuing. He declined to divulge the
candidates’ names.

The athletic committee will inter-
view a number of men concerning
the job before making any decision.
Twombly said tthey are primarily
interested in finding a_ basketball
coach. He said the lacrosse vacancy
could probably be filled within the
department.

McHenry filed his resignation, ef-
fective at the end of the school year,
several weeks ago.

 

Rifle Closes Season 1-7-1

Stifled by snow clogged roads,
the Washington and Lee rifle team
was unable to compete in last
wekend’s National Rifle Association
sectionals at Fort Lee. The team
closed its season with a 1-7-1 record.

The 1963-64 ROTC rifle team rib-
bon was presented to 11 shooters.
Captain Dick Coplan won his third
award, Harold Head and Bob Ken-
nedy their second.

Coach Jim McSheffrey had felt
the team could win third place in
the N.R.A. meet, behind VMI and
Virginia Tech.

 

Mets Make It Difficult

By ASSOCIATED PRESS
The New York Mets, known for
doing things the hard way, came up
with an unusual method of getting
a batter out in an exhibition game

the other day against the Detroit |

Tigers.

The Tiger batter popped high to-
wards first base, but Mets first base-
man Bill Hass missed the ball. Third
baseman Wilbur Huckle came over,
grabbed the ball and fired to second
baseman Larry Burright, who was
covering first. Burright tagged the
baserunner, who had taken a wide
turn. It was a first to third to sec-
ond out.

= _ ==
by Tim OKeefe

If the coaching staff's recommen-
dations for the proposed gym ma-
terialize, Washington and Lee will
really have something of which to
be proud.

I wasn’t too enthused when plans
for anew gym were announced sev-
eral weeks ago.
As soon as I heard
of them, I imme-
diately thought of
one thing we need
more—a good stu-
dent union.

But it seems the
coaches took this
into consideration
when they drew
up _ their _iist.
They’re planning a
combination gym
and student union. What they have
come up with sounds terrific.

(Before reading any farther, re-
member their recommendations
must be approved by the board of

Tiny Tim

trustees. And then there is_ the
small matter of money).
First, there would be eight

bowling alleys, several pool and
billiard tables and a_ concession
area. Also included would be six
handball and six squash courts,
a rifle range, a basketball court
seating 2,500-3,000, a much larger
swimming pool and an asphalt
practice area.

Athletic Director E. P. “Cy”
Twombly said the gym would be
as functional as possible. “We can
turn the six squash courts into
handball courts any time. The as-
phalt area could be used for tennis,
lacrosse or track any time of the
year—we would no longer be limited
by the weather.”

W&L certainly can use the 12
handball courts. Ideally, they would
be on floor level. Part of the back
partition would be of glass so inter-
ested persons could watch.

The swimming pool would be 25
yards wide—quite an improvement
when you consider the present pool
is not quite 24 yards long.

The athletic department would be
self-sustaining with the new gym.
No longer would we have to use
the VMI riflle range or the town’s
bowling alley.

Twombly believes the new facili-
ties would act as an incentive to
students and faculty. “When they
see the new equipment they will
just naturally want to use it. There
should be something for everyone.”

What are the chances of these
plans being accepted by the board
of trustees? Twombly naturally
would not give a positive answer
to the question,

His comment was, it doesn’t hurt
to try to go first class.”

Maybe the day of miracles hasn’t
passed after all.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Rewarding Discoveries Even Among C Students

(Continued from page 2)

course). One was the essay of a southern boy
who came to grips with the issues of segrega-
tion. I wish I could say he revised his attitudes,
but I can’t. Yet the paper revealed remarkable
honesty and candor, for he recognized in him-
self inherited prejudices for what they were
and in struggling todeal with them against op-
posing arguments admitted the logical futili-
ty and inhumanity of his position.

The Student Confronts a New World

The other student projected his growing
awareness of significant shifts in the patterns
of social relationship and dependency—speci-
fically, the shift from vertical structures, typi-

and taste. Both

of life? Since

fied by the family wherein generations are
closely tied against the outside world, to a hor-
izontal plane of peers who have dissolved their
ties to the past and prefer the unity of time

men were confronting a world

out of tune with regional beliefs but both
faced their own conclusions.

What are these but particular examples of
the crucial fact of human awareness:
knowledge of good and evil, the tragic sense

the

by God’s will we must leave,

we should leave the Eden of our childhood

a sense of loss,

bravely and with purpose. Inevitably we face

a fear of the future: these are

human conditions. But if our students face
them with courage, flexibility, and grace, we
will have done the utmost education can do.

 

Lane Criticizes Playboy Philosophy

(Continued from page 2)

iuses who have found creativity
independent of an active “sex”
life. Among these are artists such
as Da Vinci and Michelangelo;
writers such as Shakespeare and
Hugo; humanists such as St. Paul
and Schweitzer; philosophers such
as Kierkegaard and Emerson.

Thirdly, the Playboy philosophy
tends inadvertenly to exert a de-
humanizing influence on interper-
sonal relationships. Under the guise
of “enlightened self-interest,” it
presents a rationalization for crude
egotism. The ideal “playboy” is tthe
skilled consumer, the man of dis-
criminating taste and polish, with
the savoir-faire to drain from the

 

reservoir of experience the most

gratifying pleasures. The result, ex-
plains Unitarian minister John A.
Crane, is a “universe for rather ele-
gant and refined consumers, and
girls are the grandest of all con-
sumer goods. A girl is something
like a sports car or a bottle of Scotch
or an Ivy League suit, that is meant
to be used and enjoyed by men.”
Hence, the Playboy aura threatens
to impersonalize sex. The accent of
the new ideal is on detachment and
non-involvement; the playboy stud
revolves through life in a constel-
lation all his own. The only sex he
knows is a relationship not between
persons but between egos, each seek-
ing gratification from the other.
Sex and tthe sex partner are mere
commodities in the marketplace of
life; as the skilled consumer, the
connoisseur of pleasure, the play-

In summary, we offer the Playboy
vanguard the following: History has
shown that the dissolution of any
society begins when its members
have no reality beyond themselves.
In destroying the values that shape
such a reality for us, we should only
fall subject to the injunction that
“those who do not learn from ‘the
past are destined to repeat it.”

 

IFC Solicits Applicants
To Head 1965 Conference

The IFC is planning to sponsor
a weekend intercollegiate conference
for the spring of 1965. The project
is the finst of its kind and will re-
quire considerable work and organ-
izational ‘ability.

Applications are now being re-
ceived for the chairmanship of
this conference, preferably from
next year’s seniors. Applications
should be sent to Ken Lane, Phi
Delta Theta, by Monday.

 

NOTICE, ALL OF YE

Starting next Friday in the
Ring-tum Phi you will have the
chance to reclaim some of the
literary balance, not toilet seat
poise, which has been taken from
you by the Tuesday Edition. This
new era will commence with the
timely debut of the Phantom Bard.

The Committee sees as its purpose
to instill in the Student Body a
feeling of respect for the spirit of
the tradition of gentlemanly attire.
We encourage the student body to
keep in mind when selecting clothing
for any occasion the tacit image of
a well-groomed appearance that
the word “spirit” implies.

escape exams and sent him packing.
Though another doctor discovered a
few days later that the student had
mononucleosis , there is still no
doubt that the student was faking—
probably by not eating for two
weeks. What lengths the vicious-
natured will go to, just to confound
the virtuous.

Finally, there is the case of the
man who was involved in a bad
car wreck, He was suffering some
pain, and went to the infirmary
where he was pronounced to be
in perfect health. Despite this sa-
gacious judgment of the school
physician, the student spitefully
insisted on being in pain, and went
so far as to be examined in Roa-
noke, where he was found to have
a brain concussion. Now some
might say that this case is an
adverse reflection on the com-
petency of our school doctor. Not
at all. Could you or I, merely
by looking at the victim, tell if
he had a brain concussion or not?
Of course not! How then, could we
expect the school doctor to see
something that even we ourselves
can’t tell?!

I certainly hope that this expose
of the machinations of our school
doctor’s imbecilic critics will help
reaffirm our universal faith and
respect for him. The position of
Doctor of Medicine entails a much
greater amount of responsibility,

skill than almost any other profes-
sion. On the basis of these quali-
fications, our own doctor obviously
shines forth as a flame in the heav-
ens, a beacon light in the inky
blackness of good medicine, and the
epitome of Christian Science. Our
physician’s record speaks for itself.

In closing, let us ever remember
the immortal words of Jean Baptiste
Moliere written in praise of all
physicians of our doctor’s caliber:

remedies, and not their affilic-

Admittedly, the work is demanding. It requires that
unusual caliber of man who finds a greater satisfaction in

To outer space and into the deep sea, we take the sum
total of our scientific and managerial knowledge. A case
in point is Telstar, which represents the first step toward
a worldwide communications system. Another example,
the new deep-sea amplifier that simultaneously transmits
two-way messages. Both communications triumphs stem
from Bell System planning, research and development.

Such trailblazing projects command the best of
managerial and scientific talent. That’s why you'll find,
throughout the Bell System, men with college training as
diverse as the responsibilities they shoulder. Their back-
grounds run the gamut from liberal arts and business
courses to science or specialized engineering majors.
