Bronze Star Medal Awarded
To Horwedel, ROTC Instructor

Captain Alan T. Horwedel, new assistant professor of
military science, has been presented with the U.S. Army’s

Bronze Star Medal.

Colonel Raymond B. Steiner, Chief of the ROTC branch
of the Second Army, recently bestowed the Medal upon

Captain Horwedel in President

P. Burch, head of the ROTC De-
partment at W&L, were present at
the ceremony.

The medal was awarded for “mer-
itous achievement in ground opera-
tions against hostile forces in the
Republic of Vietnam.” Captain Hor-
wedel had been stationed in Vietnam
for eleven months during 1962-1963,
as the advisor to the First Battalion
of 48th Infantry Regiment of the
Vietnamese Army.

The citation that came with the
Medal stated that Captain Horwedel’s
“conduct under hostile fire and
during extreme hardships in the
field served as a continuing inspira-
tion for the soldiers he advised.”

Captain Horwedel graduated from
West Point and was commissioned
an officer in 1953. He had previously
served as an enlisted man from
1947 to 1949.

A native of Columbus, Ohio, Capt.
Horwedel is 33 years old. His eleven
months in Vietnam were from May
1962 until last April.

Capt. Horwedel came to Washing-
ton and Lee at the start of the cur-
rent academic year.

 

New Library
Dedicated Here

Washington and Lee will honor the
memory of a distinguished Rich-
mond alumnus tomorrow when it
dedicates the Adrian L. Bendheim,
Jr. Physics Library.

Located in the University’s new
building for physics and biology,
the library is a gift of the family
and friends of the late Mr. Bend-
heim, a 1942 graduate of Washing-
ton and Lee.

During the brief public ceremony,
Mr. Richard Bendheim of Richmond,
on behalf of the family and friends,
will present the University with a
portrait of the late Mr. Bendheim to
hang in the library.

Also participating in the dedica-
tion will be University President
Fred C. Cole, physics department
head Dr. Edward F. Turner, Jdr.,
and University chaplain Dr. David
W. Sprunt. President Cole said he
hopes Mr. Bendheim’s former facul-
ty associates and many _ other
friends will join the Bendheim fam-
ily at the 11:30 a.m. ceremony.

Prior to his death on July 25,
1959, Mr. Bendheim was active in
alumni leadership of a fund cam-
paign to provide improved facilities
for science instruction and research
at Washington and Lee. The new
facilities realized through the cam-
paign were placed in service in 1962.

Mr. Benheim, who was 37 when
struck and killed by lightning while
fishing at Virginia Beach, was a
former president of the University’s
Richmond alumni chapter.

He was active in the real estate
business, and the Real Estate Board
of Richmond now awards the Ad-
rian Bendheim, Jr., Award annually
to the city’s outstanding real estate
salesman.

Law Freshmen
Elect Bowie
As EC Member

Freshman law class elections re-
sulted in an overwhelming vote for
Jime Bowie as Executive Commit-
teeman. Ray Vizethann was elected
president of the freshman law class.

Other new officers are W. Court
Soloff (vice-president; Sam Cole-
man, secretary; and Dave Streetman,
historian.

Bowie, a Phi Kap, is married and
has three children. He entered the
Washington and Lee Law School
during the last semester of the 1962-
63 school year. Bowie graduated
from W&L in 1956 but decided not
to continue his education at the
time and went to work for Burling-
ton Industries on a sales and ad-
ministration training program. Since
returning to Washington and Lee as
a law student in February, 1963, he
has maintained an “A” average. In
the realm of extracurricular activi-
ties he is writing for the Law Re-
view, working in McCormick Law
Library, and is in the process of
becoming a book agent for the law
school. Furthermore, Bowie has been
chosen for the Mock Trial in No-
vember. In order to supplement his
income, he has set up a concession
in the basement of Tucker Hall, and
is often found selling tickets to var-
sity games. Jim also recently be-
came a member of the legal fraterni-
ty, Phi Delta Phi.

The newly elected president of
the freshman law class, Ray Vize-
thann, was graduated from Colgate
in the class of ’59. He then entered
the Navy Officers Candidate School,
acquiring special training in under-
water demolition. After the com-
pletion of this course, he was as-
signed to the Evplosive Ordnance
Disposal Corp in Hawaii, command-
ing a team of frogmen.

The new vice-president of the
freshman law class, Court Soloff, is a
graduate of Roanoke college where
he was elected president of the stu-
dent body in his senior year. Court
was also inducted into the Blue Key
honorary society and Who’s Who in
American Colleges and Universities
while at Roanoke College. Futher-
more, Soloff was president of his
fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi, and on
the Honor Council, an organization
comparable to our Executive Com-
mittee. Soloff is from Northfield, New
Jersey, and is engaged to an Ameri-
can Airline hostess.

Independent

By DEXTER FOLLOWILL

The Independent Union, at its first
regular meeting Wednesday night,
discussed the possibility of renting
a building or a large apartment for
the purpose of providing non-fra-
ternity students a meeting place.

This meeting place would be used
as a location for social activities
also. It would furnish a recreation
hall and a study area as well as
basic kitchen appliances.

Although still in the formative
stages the idea was greeted with
almost unanimous approval. The
Student Union facilities, limited by
size and University regulations,
prove to be inadequate for the ex-
pending Independent Union. There-
fore, an investigation is planned to
provide a concrete proposal, which
will be presented for the considera-
tion of the members of the Union
at some future meeting. At that
time a proposed budget for the fur-
nishing and maintainence of the site
will also be offered.

Dean Atwood has sanctioned these
preliminary plans submitted to him
by the Steering Committee.

Another item of busines of the
meeting was the discussion of future
plans for intramural participation
in bowling, handball, and basket-
ball.

The primary purpose of the as-
sembly was the election of the mem-
bers of the Steering Committee,
the executive branch of the Union.
In order to provide proportional
representation from each of the
four classes, it was decided that
three members from the freshman
class, two from the sophomore, and
one each from the junior and senior
classes would be included on this
committee.

Those elected to represent the
freshman class were Bob Radcliffe,
Randy Nunn and Dick Masters. Lew
Davis and Neil Houghton will rep-
resent the ‘sophomore, Shannon

Jung, the junior, and Rod Cockshutt,
the senior class.

A short meeting of the Steering
Committee was held after the regu-
lar meeting. Plans for further ac-
tivities were formulated.

Last year’s political upheaval mo-
tivated the formation of the group
which has extended its activities in-
to the social and athletic fields of
W&L. In the Big Four election, in
addition to the freshman E.C. elec-
tion, individual candidates backed
by the Union have been suc-essful.
These candidates were supported on
the basis of their personal qualitica-
tions as opposed to their political
affiliation.

Holmes Speaks
Here Tuesday

Dr. U. T. Holmes, Kenan profes-
sor of romance philosophy at the
University of North Carolina, will
speak Tuesday (Nov. 5) at Wash-
ington and Lee for the initial pro-
gram of the 1963-64 Seminar in
Literature series.

His public talk on “French Ro-
mances as an Early Novelistic Form”
will be at 6:15 p.m. in duPont Audi-
torium. Dr. Holmes’ appearance will
mark Washington and Lee’s 46th
Seminar in Literature program. The
series was inaugurated at the Uni-
versity in the early 1950's.

A member of the UNC faculty
since 1925 and a full professor there
since 1927, Dr. Holmes was named
Kenan professor at North Carolina
in 1945. He taught at the University
of Missouri from 1923 to 1925. He
received his M.A. and Ph.D. de-
grees from Harvard University.

Dr. Holmes, a former Fulbright
lecturer at the University of Mel-
bourne in Austrialia, has served as a

Fancy Dress V ice-prestdents
Are Appointed By Wootton

Randy Wootton, president
of Fancy Dress, announced his
vice-presidents last night along
with a surprise change in the
schedule of events.

The six vice-presidents are:
Jim DeYoung, Phi Kap, in charge of
decorations; A. J. Barranco, SAE,
in charge of the cocktail party; Fred
Cooper, Pi Phi, in charge of the
figure; Buck Ogilvie, Beta, in charge
of coordination, Mark Gee, Sigma
Chi, in charge of invitations; and
Ken Lane, Phi Delt.

Change in Schedule

Wootton, a Phi Delt, also an-
nounced that the concert will be
Saturday afternoon instead of Sat-
urday night. This change in the cus-
tomary schedule will prevent the
necessity of fraternities having to
start their combo parties late Sat-
urday night, Wootton commented.

The theme of Friday night’s dance
will be the Mardi Gras. The con-
cert Saturday will be presented with
“New Orleans” as the setting.

Wootton stated that he was very
pleased with the caliber of his
vice-presidents. “They represent a
good cross-section of student lead-
ers,” he remarked.

DeYoung, a junior, was a vice-
president of last year’s Fancy Dress.
He is captain of the tennis team,
president of his fraternity, a mem-
ber of the Varsity Club and of
SWMSFC, and a state chairman
for the Mock Convention.

Barranco, a senior is a dormitory
counselor, vice-president of the
Commerce Fraternity, a member of
varsity football, and a state chair-
man for the Mock Convention.

Cooper, a senior, is vice-president
of the IFC, a member of the As-
similation Committee, and a “char-
ter member of the Gauley Bridge
Hunt Club.” In addition, he is on
the ODK leadership Steering Com-
mittee, a freshman camp counselor,
and secretary-treasurer of the Uni-

 

alties,

versity party.

 

Ogilvie, a senior, is a member of
the Executive Committee, is a co-
captain of the football team, and a
dormitory counselor. He is a mem-
ber of SWMSFC and Phi Eta Sigma,
and has received an award as out-
standing MS-1 Cadet. He is a mem-
ber of ODK.

Gee, a junior, is a member of
the Glee Club, Sazeracs, SWMSFC,
assistant rush chairman of his fra-
ternity, and a member of the IFC

Lane, a senior, is editor of the
Friday Ring-tum Phi, senior class
president, president of his frater-
nity, and president of the Student
Service Society.

Entertainment

Entertainment for the dance and
concert is still tentative and an-
nouncements will be made in the
near future.

Wootton added that the costumes
will be approximately five dollars
less per person this year although
it will not be required, dates may
wear costumes also.

Freshmen Hold
Debate Tourney

By COLEMAN BRYDON

The results of last week’s Novice
Debate Tournament sponsored by
the W&L Forensic Union were an-
nounced today by Professor William
Chaffin.

Individual winners were: Bill Tor-
rey in first place with the high score
of 57 points out of a possible 75,
Harold Nase in second place with
48 points, and Rowland Greenwade
with 47 points; all debating the
proposition affirmatively. High men
debating the issue negatively were:
John Zink with 55 points, Bill Her-
man with 47 points, and Tom Leg-
gett, 45 points.

The winning team was, for the
negative, that of Zink and Herman,
who formed the only undefeated
team in the tournament, and for
the affirmative, that of Fred Bishop
and Harold Nase, who compiled a 2-1
record, losing only to Zink and
Herman.

The tournament was made up of
twelve participants, divided up into
three affirmative and three negative
teams. Others taking part were, John
V. Czyzewski and Charles R. Chit-
tum for the affirmative and Neely
Young, Richard T. Moss, and Wil-
liam S. Hummers, III, for the neg-
ative. The tournament was held
as a Round-Robin affair with each
participant having a different part-
ner for each debate. The subject
for the debate was the National
Debate Topic for this year, concern-
ing the responsibility of the feder-
al government in providing highter
education for qualified high school
graduates.

The debaters were judged on five
main points. The first of these was
their analysis of the opponents’
argument. The second was the reas-
oning in their speeches. Added to
this, however, was also the evidence
which they produced to back up
their arguments. They were graded
on how they organized their ma-
terial in their speeches, and also in
their refutations. Finally, their man-
ner of presentation was judged as
to effectiveness and organization.

Also last week, eight students
took part in a debate held at Bridge-
water College. Those who took part
were: Lin Hartin, Nauman Scott,
Bob Lohman, and Billy Cannon de-
bating the affirmative, and Mike Na-
tion, Jeff Gayor, John Hensley, and
Roy Powell composed the negative
teams. Coach Chaffiin said this week
has been the most active week in
forensic program in four years, as
far as the number of people involved
is concerned. With another pair of
teams consisting of Chuck Levy,
Allen Cohen, Michael Fowler, and
Tyree Harris (all picked because
of extensive high school experience)
going to Wake Forest this weekend,
a total of twenty-four students have
debated this week. Already, this
year, thirty-two students have been
exposed to debating, and this num-
ber will increase in the next weeks.

The Void

Tuesday’s editorial focus on the “Old Co-op” brings to
mind a very pressing need—that of an ideally located, on-
campus recreation center, something the University has lacked
ever since the campus Co-op was transferred to the Student
Union.

The present Co-op is particularly lacking in two respects.
The first is its location: it is out of the way of general traffic;
there are no parking facilities; it is far enough away from the
library and the dorms so that students would just as soon use
the freshman dorm cookie room as walk the extra distance.

Secondly, the present Co-op lacks any sort of atmosphere.
No attempt at all is made to give the place some personality,
and this explains why students prefer Doc’s and the College
Inn when they want a break.

Studnts are increasingly aware of a centrifugal pull exerted
on the W&L community. This void in our recreational facili-
ties helps to contribute to this pull. Between classes or during
idle moments, there is no suitable place to go except the fra-
ternity house. It is no wonder that alumni, on recalling the
happy hours of conversation and good fellowship at the old
Co-op, are amazed that we can exist without such a common
meeting place.

The old Co-op has not as yet been designated for any par-
ticular use. It has been suggested that both the basement and
the ground floor could be fixed up, with ping-pong and pool
tables, pin ball machines, juke box, and snack bar installed.
Such a set-up would be ideal for our needs. The cost (estimates
are at $20,000) would not exceed the amount necessary to
renovate the building for any other use. Perhaps if nothing
else avails, we can appeal to the alumni and friends in a “back

 

to the old Co-op” drive.

 

Brothel Used Symbolically :
In Genet’s “The Balcony”

By BOB MOTTLEY
Friday Columnist

Admirers of Alain Resnais (Who
directed Hiroshima, Mon Amour and
Last Year at Marienbad will be
happy to know of
his third major
mystical endeavor,
Muriel, which had
its New York pre-
miere this past
week. Critical re-
action was mixed;
like Marienbad
this film is so sub-
jective that one
takes frum it only
what one can
bring to it, not en-
tirely a bad principle.

Viewers of Genet’s The Balcony
will find themselves in a similar
quandary, particularly if they expect
raw sex. There is quite a bit of
lewdness going around, but the dirt
is cleverly buried in a heady brew
of philosophy. I strongly recommend
it for all members of the Assimila-
tion Committee, that they may veri-
ly see the effects of illusion.

The World a Brothel

A rough outline of the problems
at hand may be helpful: the first
brothel is seen by Genet to have
been a temple, Albee’s Earth Moth-
er (see Va. Woolf) was the first
deity to be worshipped by emerg-
ing homo sapiens in the person of a
sacred prostitute. (At least, they
weren't being hypocritical!) The
ritual was simple: one entered
the “temple,” paid one’s homage
in that good old fashioned way,
and received from the local rep-
resentative of Mumsey a tempor-
ary escape from the problems of
the day. Genet updates this fetching
concept by assuming (for The Bal-
cony, at least) that the world is
a great brothel operated by an eter-
nal Madam who is both Mumsey and
Irma ( La Douce—who else?)—she
sells her customers illusion for the

   

Mottley

When the check bounces—eventual-
ly—so does the customer—back into
ithe cold, cruel world.

This sort of thing obviously isn’t
approved by the League of National
Decency, but remember that we are
very much in the theater of the
Absurd, where to be decent is to be
normal, and hence—an outcast. As
The Balcony commences, society is
crumbling but prostitution is doing
a roaring business. Mumsey’s whore-
house is divided into separate cham-
bers of illusion. The first is a hall
of justice for masochists (a must for
all lawyers), the second a chapel for
the confessions of prostitutes, and
Time inimitably describes the third
as a “stable” where a milkman pur-
chases the illusion that he is a ca-
valry (not calvary) general and
prepares to mount his whorse.”

In Genet’s original play, those
rebelling against the Grand Dames
won out, and the ringleader con-
summates his marriage to the Earth
Mother by castrating himself. This
is a trifle strong even for Holly-
wood, and is so deleted in the film.
(You might keep it in mind as a
sort of comforting thought.)

Shelly Winters

Now to mundane matters of tech-
nique. Director Joseph Strick does
not, strictly speaking, confine him-
self to Genet’s erotic text. The
lines are sticky in places, but not
really as poetically gross as in the
original script. Still, not all of
Genet’s macabre mockery has been
done in, and enough remains to pro-
vide a stimulating evening. I rather
liked Shelly Winters’ performance
as the Madam: many have not. She
brings a certain dramatic “I-could-
care-less”-ness that comes after five
(or so) six-packs. If you really want
to think you understand The Bal-
cony, don’t show up sober. If you
are “there” sufficiently to notice de-
tails, the whole production may
seem a bit shaggy and frazzled. This
is because it was shot in Hollywood

 

currency of their sexual potency.

Fraternities Under Attack

 

(The Ring-tum Phi, in feeling
that the fraternity system is un-
dergoing a critical transition, has
enlisted reporter Warren Mont-
gomery to study and evaluate the
present status of fraternities in to-
days colleges and _ universities.
Following is the first in a series of
four articles.

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

“Isn’t it time that the American
university prepared a decent burial
for the traditional American college
fraternity? They have served an
historical purpose and served it well.
But we’ve given up banjo clubs and
minstrels. Now it’s time to face
courageously the task of replacing
the alumni-dominated fraternal sys-
tem.”

This remark by President Edward
D. Eddy of Chatham College typi-
fies the general attitude of many

 

of today’s educators, intellectuals,
and students on the collegiate fra-
ternity system. In colleges through-
out the nation, and especially in
the Eastern schools, fraternities are
under attack on charges including
academic failure, inadequate hous-
ing, inhumane hazing practices, gen-
eral uselessness, and racism.

Though the campaign against fra-
ternities, conducted by individual
college administrations and by stu-
dent opinion, is not very manifest,
its results are. Recent publications
have frequently commented on the
effects of this movement:

Snobbism and Hell-raising
“The traditional image of the fra-
ternity of the 1920’s, rooted in
snobbism and hell-raising, is crumb-
ling in the face of spreaded sophis-
tication and intellectual seriousness
on most U.S. campuses. Youngsters

 

are beginning to snipe at reaction-
ary leadership in the national or-
ganizations...at many schools the
actual prestige of fraternities seems
to be gradually withering.”

This same article, (Newsweek,
March 27, 1961) goes on to say that
traditions like “solemn rituals by
candlelight, heavily laced with cere-
mony...Frantic hazing calculated
to make boys into men... Whoop-
‘em-up parties designed to enhance
a sense of brotherhood...” are fad-
ing out of the fraternity scene.

Pseudo-solemnities

Other publications are more vir-
ulent. The Christian Century asks,
“What does the indignity of frater-
nity initiations do to the dignity of
man?” (One might doubt that this
writer has ever experienced an ini-
tiation, and if so, he is making rash
generalizations on the basis of his

 

 

The most recent sign of progress on campus is the restoration of the Memorial Gates at the parking lot entrance.
The gates were given in memory of those students who died during World War I. (Photo by Caro).

 

A Review

By BILL CHAPLIN
The American Way of Death. By
Jessica Mitford (New York, Si-
mon and Schuster, 1963).

Jessica Mitford’s beautifully writ-
ten, brilliantly documented, and
vivid examination of the American
funeral industry makes Evelyn
Waugh’s The Loved One, a satiri-
cal novel published in the thirties
with the same theme, seem like
Red Riding Hood in comparison to
the Wolf. Her purpose, unlike
Waugh’s, is to let the industry satir-
ize, and hopefully hang, itself by
giving it an open forum in her
book. It is a mock-forum, of course,
and one presided over by Miss Mit-
ford with consummate artistry and
sardonic detachment. She quotes
Howard C. Raether, executive sec-
retary of the National Funeral Di-
rector’s Association, for her perfa-
tory remark: neatly and hilariously
he says, “Funerals are becoming
more and more a part of the Amer-
ican way of life.”

Like other American institutions,
the funeral industry has grown to
bizzarre and disturbing propor-
tions, creating pseudo-events and
administering to needs which are
themselves artificially created; thus
it has grown, with all of its jargon
and trade publications and fake tra-
ditions, beyond the reach of satire.
I can imagine Swift confronted with
the problem of turning the meaning
of this ludicrous and deadly-serious
business back upon itself, and I can
imagine him failing. For the industry
satirizes itself, in its commercialism
and gaudy ostentation, and with its
tricks and big-time organizational
aspects. Its language (which Miss
Mitford captures with ease and dev-
astation) fills somber little trade

Of Tod

Memory Pictures, the
Crypt, the Memorial Counselor,
and (best of all) the Grief Therap-
ist attempt to ‘assuage grief” with
a variety of mumbo-jumbo, Marble
temples, and visions of economical
beauty.

It is not, of course, economical
to be buried these days. The average
cost of the funeral of every adult in
1961 was $1,450—somewhat more
than the cost of the pine wood
casket and family burial of the last
century. A salesman for a cremator-
ium might persuade you to place
the remains of “the loved one” in
an outdoor crypt, emphasizing that
“it’s all a part of the trend toward
outdoor living.” If you still want to
be buried, though, and you live in
southern California, then you might
be accommodated in “Forest-Lawn
Memorial-Park,” “where, as Miss
Mitford explains, “each section is
zoned and named according to the
price of burial plots. Medium priced
graves range from $434.50 in Haven
of Peace to $599.50 in Triumphant
Faith to $649.50 in Ascension. The
cheapest is $308, in Brotherly Love—

be added to the price for Endow-
ment Care,” and so on. But for those
“wishing something better (such as
the Gardens of Memory, kept locked
to the public but to which the prop-
erty owner is given a Golden Key)
there is almost no limit to the
amount you can spend.”

The amount of Miss Mitford’s
research is astonishing. One of the
most interesting and provocative
accounts which she gives con-
cerns the funeral of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who died
late in the century, perhaps, to
be buried as he explicitly wanted
to be—with simplicity and dignity.
She constructs a dialogue be-
tween what Roosevelt stipulated
and what an observer of the fun-
eral reported:

R: “... the body be not embalmed.”

O:“All three assistants worked
incessantly five hours to give the
president the proper appearance, and
to be certain of proper preserva-
tion...the tissues were firm, com-
plexion was fine and those who saw
him remarked, ‘He looks like his

When Freddy walked into his ad-
visor’s office last week he found,
to his great dis-
| may, that he had
one more U than
he had expected.
Angered. and
| broken up about
this nasty break,
he proceeded to
tell his advisor of
how the evil fra-
ternities had taken
up all of his time
with house work
and rallies.

After Homecomings, Openings, and
Parents Weekend are over, Freddy
Freshman realizes and remembers
what he is really here for. Every
year these same objections are heard
from the hapless pledges. Two years
ago the IFC took steps to remedy
the situation and abolish Hell Week.
Last year it was generally agreed
that things had changed. Most hous-
es had a policy of three hours a
week for housework and maybe one
rally every four or five weeks. Some
houses completely did away with all
“hell” activities.

There isn’t a student in school
who couldn’t spare three hours a
week to do something for his house.
An hour rally once every four
weeks is not too demanding either.
The good students are not going to
let pledging interfere with their
grades; they will merely cut out
three hours of time they would spend

 

 

doing something else. The weaker

Can Today’s Fraternity System Survive?

own experience). The magazine fur-
ther charges that nationals force
“ridiculous . . . pseudo-solemnities”
and “discriminatory clauses” on their
chapters.

Time, quoting Dr. Eddy again, says
that the fraternity system “has
failed to adapt itself to the de-
mands of the new student and to
a changing social pattern. The sys-
tem .. . should be replaced . .
with intellectual centers.”

Hard Work and Privacy

According to some authorities, stu-
dent participation in fraternal activi-
ty is decreasing. Dean George Grif-
fin at Georgia Tech has stated:
“We have students here who don’t
care whether they belong or not.
They have to work too hard.”

Walter Rea, Dean of Men at Mich-
igan, feels that “among students
here, there’s a growing feeling for
privacy. Fraternities are losing many
to apartment living.”

A committee of Brown University
undergraduates reports: “From with-
in the fraternities comes mounting
criticism of the process of rushing
and pressures which mold individ-
uals to the pattern of the group.”

Fraternities in Trouble

Perhaps the adverse fraternal sit-
uation depicted by recent publica-
tions can be taken with a grain of
salt, for journalism is not above
holding up one side of a picture to
the public. Nevertheless, there is no
doubt but that fraternities are deep
in trouble. Membership is dropping
off, as perhaps was demonstrated by
the results of W&L’s 1963 rush week.
Many schools, such as Brown and
Duke, regulate fraternities to school
housing—or glorified dorms—and
others have taken over the task
of feeding the entire student body.
In other institutions, such as W&L,
relatively mild action has been taken
in the form of changing Hell Week
to “Help” Week and by requiring
minimum grade standards for ini-
tiation.

“Frat-frying Williams”

The most glaring result of the
anti-fraternity trend is the total abo-
lition of the fraternity system at
Williams College. “Frat-frying Wil-
liams,” as one national fraternity
publication put it, assumed all of the
social, feeding, and housing func-
tions of its fifteen fraternities, which
were in effect liquidated. The reason
given by the Williams administration
for its action was that “Fraternities
have come to exercise a dispropor-
tionate role in undergraduate life.”

Student Apathy

Possibly the most significant as-
pect of the decline of the fraterni-
ties is that the movement has the
support, or at least the acquiescence,
of the students involved, including
the fraternity members themselves.
In places like Yale, chapters are
collapsing under the weight of sheer
apathy.

It is clear, then, that unless under-

(Continued on page 4)

Pledge Work Is Bearable,
Baur Tells The Freshmen

students will use pledging as an ex-
cuse for their own inadequacies.

Grow up Freddy. You have had
your dates bit; you have been on
both ends of a dump job; you have
gotten a few drunken parties in.
Now it is time to show what a
big boy you really are. You will
have work pile up on you in the
next three months; see close
friends fail out; have an unhappy
friend transfer. Stop your com-
plaining because you are only
hurting yourself. If you can’t be a
member of a fraternity and do
well at Washington and Lee, then
you shouldn’t be here. Now quit
alibing and get to work; at least
forty fraternity brothers and five
of your professors are pulling for
you.

Now that the Generals have lost
several games the criticism of the
schedule will probably stop. Un-
fortunately it never should have be-
gun. W&L has a good football team,
but even at our best we could not
play with highly subsidized schools
in the ACC or Southern Conference.

Any suggestion of better spirit at
games is welcome (cheerleaders,
drinking at game, band, etc.), but
any attack on either the schedule
or policy of the University can be
nothing but detremental to both the
team and the school.

F&M Boasts
‘New Look’

The injury total has reached sev-
en. This plus the fact Washington
and Lee must contend with a “re-
juvenated” Franklin and Marshall
team, could make things tough as
the Five Star Generals make their
second campaign into Pennsylvania
tomorrow.

Franklin & Marshall, hoping to
pull off the North’s biggest victory
since Gettysburg, is an old team
with a new look.

“They can’t be compared with the
same team we beat last season (Gen-
erals 57-FM 12), “said Coach Lee
McLaughlin. “Although they have
basically the same material we de-
feated last fall, they have a new
coach (George Storak) and, more
important, new enthusiasm.”

The Generals have been concen-
trating on pass defense this week.
“We'll need it. Franklin and Mar-
shall threw 42 passes last week
against Carneige Tech and com-
pleted a goodly percentage of them.
They really love to put the ball in
the air; in fact, they've almost aver-

aged two passes for every we

play they’ve executed.”

Coach Mac believes the Generals |
can stop the passing attack of F&M
with “a fast rush and some good ball
hawking in the secondary.”

The locals will not have senior
John Madison or halfback Harry
Brookby dressing. Madison was out
of last week’s game with Hampden-
Sydney. The headline proved a
bad omen as Madison pulled a ham-
string in the pregame warmup (no
offense please John!). Fullbacks
Syd Butler and John Anthony,
guards Bill Angel and Steve Daven-
port and quarterback Brice Gamber
will see only limited action.

Moving into the Generals starting
line-up, replacing Madison will be
Tersh Baker. The tough Baker
“could be the man to put the pres-
sure on the Franklin and Marshall
quarterback.” Other newcomers to
the starting team are guard Joe Mil-
ler, tackle Mike Jennings, and full-
back Dan Manson. Ball hawking
Bill David will move onto the Blue
team when F&M has the ball.

Don’t Jost Sit There; Express Yourself

By ROD COCKSHUTT
Friday Columnist

It still may be a little early to
suggest this, but things do seem to
be awfully quiet around here this
year; dull one might even say. I
mean, just last spring all sorts of
monumental issues—the quality of
food in the Commons, conventional
dress and the speaking tradition,
even the sanctity of the honor sys-
tem, once delivered to the saints—
were tossed around in heated debate.

Now all these ghosts have re-
turned to their graves for another
year, or so it seems. (There has
been some grumblings in the
ranks about the quality of enter-
tainment brought here by the
Dance Board, but from the looks
of things, that issue doesn’t have
much staying power.) Perhaps
then spring is the only time in

which young men’s fancies will
turn to something else besides
grades (not knowledge acquired),
the cost of combos, or the virgin
of the week.

Even then, though it still seems to
ingrown. As a rule, those issues and
problems which titillate the Wash-
ington and Lee Gentleman are so
relatively trivial that they are of
little or no importance or conse-
quence outside of Lexington.

Sad to say, the issues which are
determining the course of our na-
tion and our world—nuclear dis-
armament, racial problems, allied
diplomacy, the role of the federal
government in our society, the popu-
lation explosion, to name just a
few—are all too rarely discussed
in the editorial columns of the
Ring-tum Phi, or in the minute
number of letters to the respective
editors, or anywhere else, for that
matter.

As illogical and intemperate as they
may be at times, we can still admire
and be grateful for the Conservative
Society, and its organ, The South-
ern Conservative, and for the lonely
few individuals at the other end of
the political spectrum who have
enough faith in their philosophies to
write and speak about them—to try

to make us think outside the com-
fortable little worlds we've created
for ourselves here.

Perhaps we should hasten to add
that such complacency and lack
of concern seems to be the fate
of most colleges and universities
of Washington and Lee’s charac-
ter and disposition. Most of us,
both students and faculty, if we
are honest, will admit that it is all
too easy to glide merrily along,
day after day, without extraordi-
nary challenge to intellect or call
to substantial decision or commit-
ment.

Of course, this is a purely per-
sonal opinion, and as such I would
be the first to admit that it is liable
te error, prone to generalization.
But, obviously, I feel there’s a cer-
tain amount of truth in what I’ve
said as well. And it is this truth
that I find personally very discour-
agging. Do you?

GENERALS FACE FRANKLIN & MARSHALL

 

ISoccer, Cross-Country

Teams Meet

Washington and Lee soccer and
cross-country teams face tough op-
position Saturday when they travel
to American University in Wash-
ington. The harriers will compete
during half-time of the soccer game
scheduled to begin at 2:30 p.m.

Coach Howard Sorrell’s booters
take a 1-4-1 record against the Gen-
erals who have posted a 4-2 mark
this year. Saturday’s game could be
a duplicate of last year’s match
which ended in a 4-4 tie after seven
goals were scored during the last
three minutes of play.

Two of the three AU booters who
scored against the Generals last year
are back to try their luck again.
Center Ford Swartz and Wing Isaac
Heimbinder, who scored the tying
goal with 43 seconds remaining, are
definite starters for the Eagles Sat-
urday.

 

American U.

Washington and Lee will be de-
pending upon three mainstays—
seniors Jim Mell, a wing , Tom
Green, veteran goalie and Preben
Berthelsen, the Generals leading
scorer who will be a constant threat
to AU goalie Art Brodsky.

AU scoring leader Buddy Celt-
nieks will be looking for his fourth
goal of the season, after being shut
out in the Eagles 2-1 loss to How-
ard University last Saturday. AU
has now given up 11 goals in six
games, but has scored only 6 on
offense.

Coach Tom Evaul’s harriers, who
finished last in a fourway meet last
Saturday with Georgetown, William
and Mary, and St. Joseph’s will be
gunning for their third win of the
season. Fred Cheney and Ed Orem
will lead the Eagles against a fairly

' strong General lineup.

Letters To The Editor ...

 

 

Sir:

I write regarding Rod Cockshutt’s
comments in last Friday’s edition
on the ideological inconsistencies of
the right-wing.

Would that I could—with the same
blind irrationality of some in the
lunatic fringe of the rightist camp—
condemn his views as merely the
ravings of a misguided social re-
former!

However—much to the surprise of
some, I’m sure—I agree with him
at least insofar as he says there is
some inconsistency in the view
which says in the same breath that
the Supreme Court has “taken God
out of the schools’ ’and “put the

| niggers in.”

I wish only to point out here
that those people most emphatically
do not represent responsible, phil-
osophical conservatism. They are
many of us on the so-called “right-
wing” who realize quite well the
gravity of social problems like
prayer in public schools and the
rights of citizenship for Negroes.
Our quarrel with the “left-wing”
is over means—not ends.

My one direct criticism of Mr.
Cockshutt’s column is his derisive
attitude toward “America’s Chris-
tian Heritage”—“whatever that is,”
he says.

I commend to his attention the
writings of any of those great men
who helped mould the institutions
of this country. Almost to a man,
they were Christians in the broad-
est sense, even when not so in
a technical, orthodox sense. I also
suggest reflecting on our social and
economic structures, which seek
always to emphasize the primacy of
the individual.

These impel me to conclude that
our “Christian heritage” is not, af-
ter all, that hard to discern.

graduates and faculties change their |

present positions, the old system
that we have inherited will not sur-
vive on the great majority of
campuses. It is not likely that fra-
ternities will disappear completely
from the college scene, but they will
