Sixteen New
Men For ’63)

By MATT THOMPSON

On Wednesday night, September |
25, the Student Service Society |
elected sixteen new members to)
its ranks. Out of the forty-eight stu- |

Or

dents interviewed, thirty-two were |,

sophomores and sixteen were jun-|
iors. |

The three juniors and thirteen | |

sophomores chosen were: Rick Car-|
rell and Bill Price, SAE juniors;)
Lou Paterno, Phi Delt junior; Dave |
Fleischer, Fred Mindel, and Steve |
Sweitzer, ZBT sophomores; Bob Lee |
and Tom Robertson, Phi Psi sopho-|
mores; Steve Yancey, Charlie Liv-|
ingston, and Peter Kintz, Beta soph-|
omores; Bob Vaughan and John E.|
Moore, Delt sophomores; Bernie|
Harper and John Baber, Phi Delt |
sophomores; and Dave Marchese, Phi
Gam sophomore. |

The Student Service Society was|
formed for the purpose of assisting
the University administration in the
field of public relations.

The chief function of this Society |
is the introduction of prospective
Washington and Lee students to life |
on this campus from a_student’s|
point of view. The prospective fresh- |
man as well as applicants for schol-|
arship are given a tour of the cam-|
pus with a detailed explanation of |
Washington and Lee traditions and|
institutions.

The SSS also aids the adminis-|
tration in various ways on Parents’ |
Weekend, Alumni Weekend, and|
SIPA Weekend.

The present officers include Ken}
Lane, president, a Phi Delt senior |
from Richmond, and Dick Kreitler, a|
Phi Psi junior from Short Hills, New |
Jersey, secretary.

As Homecoming

By LARRY MEEKS

In its Monday night meeting, the |
Interfraternity Council voted not}
to have house decorations during|
Homecomings this year. The move |

Art Broadus, IFC President, point-
ed out that the change is only for|
the current year and the tradition
of house decorations will be re

judges from the faculty and school |
administration. Each house is invited |
to submit an entry and the non-}
fraternity men are also invited to
submit an entry for the annual con-|
test, making a total of nineteen girls.

Pictures of the girls are to be
turned into the IFC at its weekly
meeting on October 7. The girls must
be able to attend Saturday’s game
in order to be eligible for the con-
test.

According to Broadus, there

Qualities of face and figure which
last year’s members lacked will be
present when the W&L glee club
opens its season with the Parents

October 26.

Dorcas Campbell, Miss Virginia of
1963, will join glee club soloist John
Baker in several numbers from the
popular Broadway hit, West
Story. In addition, Miss Campbell
will several selections of her
own.

Miss Campbell, a native of Rock-
bridge County, is a graduate of
Richmond Professional Institute.

Last February, the 23 year old
brunette appeared on nation-wide

State Chairmen
Are Announced

The selection of state ch

airmen for Mock Convention

delegations, made last June, was released to the Ring-tum Phi
today by the convention’s Steering Committee.

At the same time the Steering Committee announced
that five state chairmanships were now open because of per-

sonal conflicts among students

Eighty-six
Go Deferred

Wednesday night, all the members
of the freshman class who were in-
terested in pledging a fraternity,
but had not yet done so for one
reason or another, met with I. F. C.
President Art Broadus in the Stu-
dent Union for the purpose of disc-
cussing the procedure of Deferred
Rush.

Deferred Rush Early

President Broadus announced
that the I. F. C. had voted at its
meeting Monday night to have De-
ferred Rush begin two weeks after
the end of formal rushing instead of
the last year’s three weeks. He also
reminded the Freshmen that the
No-Contact Rule will be strictly en-
forced until Deferred Rush begins
at 1 p.m. on Saturday, October 5.

Informal Poll

At this meeting the Ring-tum Phi
conducted an informal poll of eigh-
teen freshmen, and asked them their
reasons for going deferred. Three
replied that they had not gotten a
bid, and four others said that they
had not gotten the bid they wanted.

Four freshmen said that they
thought that the rush system was in-
effective in that it did not give
people a real chance to see more
than six houses.

Other Reasons Given

Two freshmen said they did not
accept a bid they got because they

did not like the other prospective |

pledges that they saw at the second
Wednesday evening date, and one
other said that he did not like the
conduct of some of the brothers at
that time.
Crowd System

One freshman said that he thought
that the system was a “crowd sys-
tem,” that it tried to work too fast,
and that it did not give a freshman
much of a free choice. He said that

These Four Years

During the past two weeks, the Class of 1967 has been
formally introduced to Washington and Lee.

In a chain of assemblies, the freshmen have been told that
their university has a great deal to offer. They have been hear-
ing about certain ideals and traditions that make W&L unique;
they have been introduced to the men and facilities that will be
at their disposal for the next four years.

While all this is sinking in, we would like to volunteer
to you, the Class of 1967, a few words of wisdom.

If you are the average college freshman you will soon re-
gard as simple idealism most of the remarks you are now hear-
ing. Before too long, you will be encountering disappointment
after disappointment with what you are being told W&L can

ive.

: If you are the average freshman you will begin to reflect
satirically upon the ideals this University professes to stand
for: the speaking tradition, the “W&L gentleman,” conven-
tional dress, even the honor system.

You will also come to other disappointing conclusions:
there is no school spirit, the faculty is uninspiring, intellectual
curiosity is nil.

In short, you will discover that W&L will not give you the
fulfillment you look for, and you will be able to think up plen-
ty of reasons why.

However, there will be some of you who, for reasons in-
comprehensible to the average student, will discover at Wash-
ington and Lee the opportunities and inspiration you need for
complete fulfillment. You will find that our traditions and ideals
still exist, but they demand a great deal of effort to stay nour-
ished. For some few of you in the Class of 1967, then, the next
four years will be the most challenging and maturing experience
of your lives.

How do we explain this?

There was once the story of two boys—one an extreme
pessimist and one an extreme optimist. Psychologists decided
to experiment to see if they would ever change. The pessimist
was locked for twelve hours in a room furnished with every
source of entertainment immaginable—games, books, toys,
food, etc. At the end of the day, the boy was found sitting
idle in the middle of the room. Needless to say, he had not
budged an inch.

The optimist was locked for the same numer of hours in
a room completely barren except for a large pile of manure.
At the end of the day, the guilt-stricken doctors opened the
door to find the boy energetically digging into the mound.

When asked what he was doing, the optimist simply re-
plied that with all that manure there was bound to be a pony!

Fortunately, you are not faced with the same situation as
this optimist: the resources at hand are practically unlimited.
But few of you will ever think positively enough to recognize
this wealth. One of our saddest tragedies is that the majority
of students entering W&L will never experience what this uni-
versity can offer. If you are the “average” freshman, you will
share this tragedy.

 

Freshmen Are Human Beans, Too

At the outset of every school year there appears at Wash-
ington and Lee a last vestige of the days when freshman hazing
was sanctioned by the university and by the student body. This
last evidence that freshmen are not really full human beings,
this holdout of the collegiate dark ages, is, of course, the ludi-
crous “beanie.” It is truly farcical that the W&L student gov-
ernment expends effort to enforce conformity to the wearing
of this asinine skullcap. From the first the beanie contradicts
the idea that W&L men are gentlemen; for what gentlemen
would willingly be seen in such headgear? Beanies are prepos-
terously incongruous with conventional dress. Far from being
appropriate to a gentleman’s apparel, the beanie is actually
suitable to High School Harry in his natural habitat. If the
reader doubts the absurdity of the beanie, let him dare to wear
one to classes himself.

The beanie, though, is a difficult thing to attack, not be-
cause it is a revered tradition, but because it is so foolish that it
merits little consideration as a subject of reform. Beanies are
so silly that they can scarcely be called degrading. Washington
and Lee teems with willing crusaders of all sorts, but none of
them openly opposes the beanie. Yet if it is hard to arouse
serious opposition to the beanie, it is even harder to think up
some excuse for retaining the tradition. The freshman are told
each year that they must wear beanies in order that the upper-
classmen may recognize them as newcomers. It is highly un-
likely, however, that the freshman receives any special con-
sideration for wearing a beanie; more probably the beanie
tends to set him off as a person not worth paying any atten-
tion to. The freshmen are also told that they must wear beanies
in order that Lexington townspeople may recognize them as
new students. This is an “advantage” which would be auto-
matically declined by any student who has ever had to face a
group of the local gallants staring at his beanie. In the end the
beanies’ only real support might come from those students who
favor them as creating another possible offense for which a
freshman may be turned in to, and fined by, the Assimilation
Committee.

W and L’s Values Survive Only As Result
Of Sharing In A ‘Give And Take’ Process

The following is a reprint from
last year’s Ring-tum Phi written
when Noell was Assimilation Com-
mittee chairman.—Ed.

By BILL NOELL
Student Body President

Washington and Lee is not unique
among American universities solely
because of its rich
past and _ conse-
quent legacy of
tradition; other
schools are end-
dowed eaqually
generously with
notable founders,
successful alumni
and campuses
“unrivalled in
beauty.”
Nor do we stand
alone in our con-
tributions to this state or to the
nation, though we do take justifiable
pride in them. We certainly are not
the only institution to stress full
development of the individual, so-
cially or scholastically. Rather, it
is in terms of the image which
Washington and Lee connotes, that

 

Noell

 

our measure of distinction has be-
come significant and unparalleled.

That image is not the result of
our unthinking and unwilled devo-
tion to traditions; it is not because
Robert E. Lee spoke to other people
whom he encountered that we ob-
serve the speaking tradition; it is
not because Robert E. Lee dressed
meticulously that we are committed
to conventional dress; it is most em-
phatically not because Robert E. Lee
endorsed the freshman beanie with
his dying breath that men in their
first year at this university are re-
quired to mark themselves tempor-
arily with that conspicuous piece
of blue cloth.

The traditions to which the stu-
dent body subscribes are constant
values in an age in which the very
weak, the very meaningless and the
very sorry relative value too often
is the standard against which we
judge our actions. The four year
educational process at Washington
and Lee is something for in excess
of the mastery of one’s academics:
it is a give and take process, dur-
ing which the university receives

chants to new students on the cam-
pus, the beanie is indicative of the
man, with whom the student body
and alumni are sharing the most
valuable conventions imaginable—
those which instill a sense of pride
in the individual—pride in him-
self as a man, and pride in this uni-
versity, which it is his calling to

benefits for the student’s having been

dent’s outlook and sense of values
receive the benefit of conscious di-
rection with respect to established
standards.

The role, then of the much criti-

Nevertheless, great movies do appear
occasionally, and we shall try not to

The purpose of this particular

so much to offer the jaded reader

Delicate Balance In Teaching
Stressed by Pres. Fred C. Cole

By FRED C, COLE
From the Journal of
Medical Education

There is always the argument that
the prestigious scholar or scientist
can lift the academic or intellectual
level of a university merely by his
presence there. Maybe so, but I
doubt that it has the effect some
say it does. The undergraduate, who
is just starting on an academic ca-
reer and is perhaps never more
susceptible to enlighten influence,
derives little benefit from infrequent
glimpses of a research scholar who
devotes virtually all his energy and
time exclusively to research and
study—rarely, if ever, finding occa-
sion to talk with young people and
answer their questions.

When such men are a part of a
university community, they can ex-
ert tremendous influences for good

 

among students and faculty alike;
but the influence can usually be im-
portant only if their research activ-
ities can be made meaningful to these
others.

The nuclear physicist of interna-
tional fame, engaged in research
which employs the latest high-pow-
ered accelerator, certainly is apply-
ing principles that the student should
know and understand; but the
chances are that his greatest efforts
are far above the student’s ability
to comprehend and appreciate. Stu-
dents who hold graduate fellow-
ships and research assistantships
often become little more than clerks
or errand boys in these exciting
projects, and they learn little in
relation to the time spent. In the
case of those faculty members who
are supposed to pursue research and
teach, I have observed a tendency
in many to devote more time and

 

DeJarnette Unchained

Here Come

By JACK DeJARNETTE

Once upon a time not so very
long ago there was a little boy who
wanted a popsickle. Since this little
boy did not have the money with
which to buy this
popsickle, he was
not quite sure
what he should
do. He thought it
would help him
to walk down to
his house and get
- the money from
his mother.

So he went
down to his house
and said to his
mother, “I want a
popsickle so give me the money
for it.” His mother said, “No, not
unless you ask for it politely.”

Instead of doing so he began to
call her names, and so she sent him
to bed without any supper, and it
was days before she would buy him
a treat.

Moral: Insult gathers just about as
many flies as vinegar.

Hotel Fire

If Wednesday’s “fire” is any in-
dication of the spirit of the school
this year, then the cheerleaders are
going to have a particularly rough
job on their hands at football games.
Not only was the attendance poor,
but what little yelling there was, was
immediately squelched by a brick-
throwing member of the fire depart-
ment .

Hollins and Baldwin Mixers

Well, Hollins and Mary Baldwin
both had their mixers this past
weekend. The only difference was

 

DeJarnette

 

That Aesop

that you could breathe at the Hol-
lins mixer, whereas at Baldwin you
had to wear tennis shoes so you
could sprint outside for a cigarette
and a breath of air. At least I can’t
think of any other logical reason
why the girls wore tennis shoes to
a dance, but maybe you can. (Ac-
tually the girls wore them so they
could outrun the “wolfish upper-
classmen” from W&L and catch the
innocent freshmen from “THE” Uni-
versity). There were twelve W&L
freshmen there and four busloads
of U. Va. freshmen. It was a good
thing that some of our sophomores,
juniors, and seniors so nicely de-
cided to go and fill up the room.

But don’t give up hope for lack
of social experiences. If the master
plan of the Tuesday edition goes
through, who knows what may
happen? Perhaps we could even
have a dance with the V. M. L
summer school boys (commonly
known as the football team).

Think of the headlines this would
make in the Alumni Magazine. Bet-
ter still, think of the headlines it
would make in the Southern Col-
legian.

More Joint Activities

This would only be the very be-
ginning of joint activities with our
nearest academic neighbor. We could
dance with them in summer, play
football with them in the fall, drink
with them at Christmas, and in the
spring we could combine their dress
parades with Corps Days. Then we
could take all the people who went
crazy and lock them up with our
locked reserved books, using a lock
borrowed from the P. E. department
since it would not ever be opened
again anyway.

The observant freshman knows
that Lexington boasts two theatres:
the State and the Lyric, the latter
known affectionately as the “arm-
pit.” The State shows the usual
tripe from Hollywood, the Lyric
generally features revivals from the
past and a generous selection of art-
films from both foreign and domes-
tic (non-Hollywood) sources. This
past weekend was a good example
of the fare available: Hootenanny
Hoot (the State) was delightful if
one didn’t look at the screen, while
the Lyric aired War and Peace, a
convincing if truncated adaptation
of the novel by Tolstoi. Audrey
Hepburn was not the Natasha Rostof
that Jean Simmons could have been,
but the cast and direction were gen-
erally superb. It was refreshing—
once—to see battle sequences that
were really effective, instead of the
usual tub-thumping. The State
promises to redeem itself by bring-
ing us The Great Escape and Irma
La Douce; the Lyric will offer soon
Advise and Consent and the finest
American art-film to date: David
and Lisa.

Lothesome Summer Schedule

Mention must be made of an
unusually vapid and _ loathsome
summer schedule of films here that
did nothing to entertain the few
students left in town. The Lyric,
under temporary domestic manage-
ment, perpetrated a ghastly parade
of John Wayne westerns, oriential
despots, and stereotyped ghouls. The
State managed a few weeks of sum-
mer Hollywood fare: The Brothers
Grim (which was—grim), Summer

attention to research and less to
teaching.

In most universities, rank and file
faculty members are expected to
engage in research activity. In some
instances, there are university funds
available for financing worthwhile
faculty research interests; in others,
faculty members are encouraged to
seek outside support for their work.
Where outside support is sought
a well planned, coordinated, proper-
ly administered university program,
good results are expected; but often
there is an absence of planning or
coordination or decision, and much
energy is wasted—or much effort
is duplicated—and projects are un-
dertaken that shift the emphasis of
a department or a school or perhaps
a whole institution.

A delicate balance between the
teaching and research responsibili-
ties of a professor and of a univer-
sity must be maintained, or there
will result, I fear, emphasis upon
research that lessens the effective-
ness of the teacher.

Is teaching less significant than
reasearch? I think not.

Is there no way in which the
two can be blended effectively so
that all concerned—the student, the
professor, the university, the out-
side sponsor—will benefit? I think

ot Magic (which wasn’t), and The
re ., | Longest Day (an admirable traves-
In the simplest way I can say it, ty)

universities perhaps will just have
to balk at taking on increasing re-
search loads for outside sponsors.
Many of the assignments accepted by
universities could be just as effec-
tively, perhaps more effectively,
carried on in nonacademic labora-
tories and testing facilities.

Some universities appear to be
eager to take on any and all re-
search assignments, whether they are
related to the primary objectives of
the institution or not. Some accept
grants that have such limitations at-
tached to them by the sponsor that
they are virtually valueless in serv-
ing any objective of the university
at all. Increasing numbers of spon-
sors contribute to colleges and uni-
versities without undue restrictions;
but there are enough who continue
to impose these burdens as to con-
stitute cause for concern.

New York Film Festival

In New York this past week, the
festival of art-films at Philharmonic
Hall continued to attract wide praise.
Three movies of special interest en-
joyed better-than-average recep-
tions on and off Broadway: The
Haunting, directed by Robert Wise,
Mondo Cane (“A World Gone To
The Dogs”), a documentary of hu-
man(?) behavior much deeper than
its contrived title suggests, and Vis-
conti’s The Leopard. Hopefully,
these will find their way to Lex-
ington in the near future. We might
have, also, two of the most honor-
able and least obnoxious of Oscar
winners: West Side Story and Law-

Freshmen: Meet Your Coaches;

Lyles and Leslie In Spotlight

By SHAUN DONAHOE

With the fall athletic season in
full swing, the editors have decided
to interview the various coaches in
order that the student body might
get better acquainted with them.
This week, Coaches Joe Lyles and
Buck Leslie share the spotlight.

Coach Lyles, entering his fifth
season as soccer mentor, came to
W&L from Springfield College,
where he received his masters in
1959. Lyles, a native of St. Louis
played football, basketball, and base-
ball at St. Louis University for two
years before deciding to give pro
baseball a try in 1949. For three
years he roamed the St. Louis
Browns’ organization as a combina-
tion pitcher-outfielder. During these
years Lyles spent the winter months
playing pro basketball with now-
defunct NBA franchises in St. Louis,
Chicago, and Syracuse.

In 1952 Lyles spent ten months
touring 44 countries the world over
playing against the Harlem Globe-
trotters. Returning to the US., he
was greeted by the outstretched hand
of Uncle Sam and spent the next
two years as coach of the famed
Brooke Army Comets at Fort Sam
Houston in San Antonio. Under

 

Lyles’ tutelage, the Comets reached
the semi-finals of the service basket-
ball tournament there.

A back injury received in the
service having cut short his baseball
career, Lyles took the job of swim-
ming director at the Palm Beach
Cabana Club upon discharge. The
desire to finish his college educa-
tion was too strong, however, and,
at the age of 25, Lyles entered
Springfield. It was while at Spring-
field that he met his wife Pat, who
is a frequent spectator at the Gen-
erals’ soccer games.

Coach Buck Leslie enjoyed an
outstanding athletic career before
turning to coaching in 1950. A na-
tive of Rockbridge county, Leslie
captained his high school baseball
team and quarterbacked the football
team. After graduating from high
school, he served a three-year hitch
with the Navy in the Pacific during
World War II before coming to W&L
in the fall of 1945. With W&L a
member of the Southern Conference
at that time, Leslie lettered in base-
ball each of his four years here.
A strong-armed righthander, Leslie
passed up an offer from the Brook-
lyn Dodgers to devote more time

Soccer Team Travels To Pfeiffer

Hopes High For Undefeated Year

By TIM HENRY

On Friday the W&L booters meet
Pfieffer College in their season
opener at Pfeiffer. This small North
Carolina college has already played
one game, a 4-1 loss to North Caro-
lina State last Wednesday, while
W&L’s only test was a 6-1 win
over the freshman team earlier this
week.

Prospects for a win look favorable
for Coach Lyle’s soccermen who
boast a strong forward line and a
formidable defense. Only two mem-
bers of last year’s team which beat
Pfeiffer 2-1 will be missing.

All week the defense has been
adjusting to the “M” offense that

 

steady rain and three inches of mud.
This year, however, Coach Lyles
feels the team is much more profi-
cient in the fundamentals and should
take charge early in the game. Last
year, Pfeiffer scored first and W&L
had to fight back to score two goals
in the final quarter to win a game
they dominated three quarters of the
time. A more “opportunistic” for-
ward line should take advantage of
the breaks and go ahead early this
year.

Although he is taking one game
at a time, Coach Lyles is looking
forward to a fine season for his men.

Macon Seeking Second Win;
Generals Ready For Opener

It has been six long years since|
Randolph-Macon whipped Washing-
ton and Lee in football, but Satur-
day could be the Yellow Jackets’
day.

The Generals open their 1963 cam-
paign against what W&L head coach
Lee MeLaughlin terms “a consider-
ably stronger Randolph - Macon
club.” Game time is 2 p.m. on Wil-
son Field.

“Randolph-Macon gave us our
closest game last year,” McLaughlin
said, “and this year it has one of
its best teams in several seasons.”

The Jackets last defeated Wash-
ington and Lee in 1957, 33-6. The
clubs tied, 33-33, in 1959, and W&L
has won the last three games in the}
traditional state encounters.

In 1962, it took a combination of
some fancy running by halfback
Stuart Yoffe and a TD pass from
fullback Tommy Keesee to end
Buck Ogilvie to subdue a bunch of
stubborn Jackets, 19-13, at Ashland.

This year, however ,the Generals
may have to battle even harder to
pick up a win.

Randolph-Macon, coached by
W&L alumnus Joe McCutcheon, al-
ready has one win under its belt—
a 6-0 triumph over Millersville—
and game experience is mighty val- |
uable in early season play.

 

Moreover, the Jackets unveiled a!
new lonesome end offense, and a}
defense which held Millersville to!
two first downs and 177 yards total!
offense last Saturday in Pennsyl-
vania.

“T had to come away impressed!
with Randolph-Macon’s overall de-|
fensive ability,” said Wé&L chief |
scout Boyd Williams. “They tackled |
extremely well, rushed the passer |
all day and displayed a real tough |
pass defense by intercepting four |
passes.”

Linebackers Bill Wester and Jack |
Luck, an All-Stater last year, are!
the cornerstones in the Jackets’ rock |
wall defense.

Although Randolph-Macon did not |
generate much of an offensive threat |
against Millersville; Williams still,
warned:

“We have to respect Luck and
quarterback Charles D’Alessandro as
runners, and they have other boys
who can run too.” a

The Jackets’ new offense is another
point of concern for W&L.

“The lonesome end offense with
an unbalanced line is simpler to run,
but harder to plan defense for,” said
McLaughlin.

ing champions of the College Ath-
letic Conference, has been plagued
by a rash of nuisance injuries in the
last two weeks of practice.

“I think we will have everybody
except halfback Billy Andrews well
for Randolph-Macon and we hope
they will all be in good physical con-
dition,” McLaughlin said.

“The boys have been working real
hard, but don’t exactly know what
we have yet,” McLaughlin said.

On paper, however, McLaughlin
has one of his finest clubs in his
seven years at Washington and Lee
with 23 lettermen and two dozen
very promising sophomores.

So far McLaughlin has been very
impressed with the work of sopho-
mores John Kelly, Joe Miller, Larry
Craig, Tersh Baker, Bob Barclay,
John Anthony, Starke Sydnor and
Harry Brookby.

McLaughlin, who plays percent-
age football right down the line, is
preparing one surprise for the Yel-
low Jackets—a stronger passing at-
tack.

“We're not going to hesitate to
throw the ball this year, at least
until we realize we can’t,’ Mce-
Laughlin said.

“Quarterback John McDaniels has
been doing the best passing since his
freshman year. He’s been zeroing in
pretty well and he really fires the
football. A. J. Barranco is also a
good passer.”

Both McDaniel and Barranco are
seniors.

“We are not going to neglect our
running though,’ McLaughlin added.
“If we can run with success, we'll
run. If we can pass successfully,

| we'll pass.”

Halfbacks Yoffe, Henry Sackett,
Bill David and Skip Chase and full-
backs Dan Manson, Syd Butler and
Anthony are the Generals’ big guns
on the ground. In the line, Mec-
Laughlin will be counting especially
on the services of tackle Jimmie
Sylvester and ends John Madison
and Buck Ogilvie.

The Generals will be looking for-
ward to their encounter if only for
the purpose of stopping the Jacket’s
big gun, fullback Jack Luck. He
ran for the big yardage last year.

Generals Meet Randolph-Macon
To Open 1963 Football Season

By TOM DAY
Sports Editor

The Generals of Washington and
Lee open their football season on
September 28 against Randolph-
Macon Men’s College at Wilson
Field. This is a particularly signifi-
cant date in the life of head coach
Lee McLaughlin in that it marks his
seventh year as skipper of the W&L
football team. Coach McLaughlin
came to W&L in 1957 and, through
his unceasing efforts, has brought the
school back to the football respec-
tability that it once held.

A total of 65 boys have turned out
to play. Among these are several
outstanding juniors and seniors along
with some very talented sophomores.
Coach McLaughlin compares this
team to the one he fielded in 1961
and won nine and lost none. Never-
theless, the Generals face some ex- |
tremely rugged opponents and are
going to have to apply the pressure
when it is needed. A team new to
the schedule is Susquehanna Uni-
versity, a small, Pennsylvania col-
lege that is going into the 1963 sea-
son with a string of 22 consecutive
victories.

Also among the new teams the
Generals will face is Oberlin Col-

 

lege from the Ohio Conference. Back
after a year’s layoff is Washington
University who won 5 and lost 3 in
1962.

Last year the team lost only eight
men through graduation. Some of
these eight figured strongly in last
year’s 8-1 record, however. Men
like All-State tackle Bob Payne,
All-State fullback Tommy Keesee,
and quarterback Chuck Lane will be
hard to replace. Coach Mac has only
three returning lettermen at tackle,
three at quarterback, and one at
fullback.

To help solve these and other
problems, McLaughlin has many tal-
ented sophomores that he can work
with besides the experienced juniors
and seniors. “The best thing about
our sophomores is their eagerness
and dedication,’ Coach Mac says.
“We could suffer from senioritis but
with a bunch like this coming on,
we won’t worry too much. It’s pos-
sible that sophomores could unseat
some of our seasoned veterans by

| mid-season.”

McLaughlin says the Generals
will be as good offensively in 1963
as they were in 1962, if not better.
There won’t be the passing threat

THE DEAN YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN

Colleges are complicated and bewildering places, filled with
complicated and bewildering people. Today let us examine
one of the most complicated and bewildering —yet fetching and
lovable—of all campus figures. I refer, of course, to the dean
of students.

Policeman and confessor, shepherd and seer, warden and
oracle, proconsul and pal—the dean of students is all of these.
How, then, can we understand him? Well sir, perhaps the best
way is to take an average day in the life of an average dean.
Here, for example, is what happened last Thursday to Dean
Killjoy N. Damper of the Duluth College of Belles Lettres
and Pemmican.

At 6 a.m. he woke, dressed, lit a Marlboro, and went up on
the roof of his house to remove the statue of the Founder
which had been placed there during the night by high-
spirited undergraduates.

At 7 a.m. he lit a Marlboro and walked briskly to the cam-
pus. (The Dean had not been driving his car since it had been
placed on the roof of the girls dormitory by high-spirited
undergraduates.)

At 7:45 a.m. he arrived on campus, lit a Marlboro and
climbed the bell tower to remove his secretary who had been
placed there during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.

At 8 a.m. he reached his office, lit a Marlboro, and met with
K. Pluribus Ewbank, editor of the student newspaper. Young
Ewbank had been writing a series of editorials urging the
United States to annex Canada. When the editorials had
evoked no response, he had taken matters into his own hands.
Accompanied by his society editor and two proofreaders, he
had gone over the border and conquered Manitoba. With great
patience and several Marlboro Cigarettes, the Dean persuaded
young Ewbank to give Manitoba back. Young Ewbank, how-
ever, insisted on keeping Winnipeg.

At 9 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with Robert
Penn Sigafoos, president of the local Sigma Chi chapter, who
came to report that the Deke house had been put on top of
the Sigma Chi house during the night by high-spirited under-
graduates.

At 10 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and went to umpire
an intramural softball game on the roof of the law school
where the campus baseball diamond had been placed during
the night by high-spirited undergraduates.

At 12 noon the Dean had a luncheon meeting with the
prexy, the bursar, and the registrar, at the bottom of the cam-
pus swimming pool where the faculty dining room had been
placed during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.
Marlboros were passed after luncheon, but not lighted, owing
to dampness.

At 2 p.m., back in his office, the Dean lit a Marlboro and
received the Canadian Minister of War who said unless young
Ewbank gave back Winnipeg, the Canadian army would march
against the U.S. immediately. Young Ewbank was summoned
and agreed to give back Winnipeg if he could have Moose Jaw.
The Canadian Minister of War at first refused, but finally con-
sented after young Ewbank placed him on the roof of the
metallurgy building.

At 3 p.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with a delega-
tion from the student council who eame to present him with
a set of matched luggage in honor of his fifty years’ service as
dean of students. The Dean promptly packed the luggage with
all his clothing and fled to Utica, New York, where he is now

in the aluminum siding game. cS

Beanies: An Absurd Tradition

(Continued from page 2)

If this year’s freshman class behaves itself, it will gain the
privilege of burning its beanies in less than three weeks.
(Here’s hoping this takes place before heavy rains come and
the cheap dye in the beanies runs all over 338coats) The
beanies need never be seen on this campus again if enough
students express to the Assimilation Committee and the Execu-
tive Committee a desire to abolish them. Beanies should follow
the way of the dodos and the dinosaurs; they should be seen
only in museums. But not the Lee Chapel museum—Robert E.
Lee was not a man who would have condoned beanies.

Last night in duPont Auditorium,
Mr. Robert Schuettinger, a doctoral
student in political theory at Ex-
eter College in Oxford, delivered a
speech on The Welfare State:
Liquidation and Progress. Mr.
Schuettinger was the guest of the
W&L Conservative Society.

The theme of Mr. Schuettinger’s
talk was that throughout the world—
and especially in England—the ten-
dency toward the welfare state is
decreasing. Mr. Schuettinger augu-
mented his lecture with examples,
particularly the results of a recent
survey conducted in England which
shows that 67 per cent of the Eng-
lish would prefer private health
insurance to the state system now
in existence.

Mr. Schuettinger went on to say
that the present system of public
welfare in this country should not
be abolished but rather reformed.
Such items of public welfare as
education, social security, and health
insurance would be made available
by the government to those who
want them, but the citizens who pre-
fer private welfare programs would

he thought this fault inherent in the
system. The remaining people who
were polled simply said that they
were too mixed up to decide.

Of the ninety-eight members of
the freshman class who did not
pledge at the end of Rush Week,
eighty-six registered with the L. F. C.
for Deferred Rush.

Although only seventy per cent
of this year’s freshman class pledged
a fraternity at the end of Rush
Week, this figure is down only five
per cent from the number who
pledged at the end of last year’s

year’s freshman class pledged a

that Lane provided, but both Mc-
Daniel and Barranco are effective
short passers, and the Generals have
top receivers in John Madison, Yoffe,
end Buck Ogilvie and halfback Bill
David. McLaughlin plans to con-
tinue the basic “Go-T” offense that
has proven so effective in past years.

Defensively, Coach Mac sees in
this team the stinginess that made
W&L one of the top defensive teams
in the nation in 1961. With line-
