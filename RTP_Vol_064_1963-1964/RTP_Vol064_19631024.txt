Finestone Wins EC Election
With Small Vote Margin

By CHARLES NEWMAN

The Freshman Class elected Stuart
Finestone Executive Committeeman
Monday night in the Commons by a
vote of 166 to 138, a narrow margin
of 28 votes.

Finestone, a ZBT pledge, was the
Progressive Party candidate. He
defeated Bryant Kendrick, Phi Delt
freshman and University Party can-
didate.

The new EC member is from Nor-
folk where he attended Granby
High School. As a freshman and
sophomore, Finestone was president
of his class. He was elected vice-

Futch Speaks

On GOP Policy
To Republicans

At the Young Republican meeting
last night, Dr. Jefferson Davis Futch
of the W&L History Department
spoke on GOP foreign policy, past
and prospective.

His talk proposed reform of the
party’s foreign policy orientation in
a number of fields. One problem
taken up was co-existence and its
nature as a temporary cold war ex-
pedient or as a permanent state of
international equilibrium, the former
described by the speaker as prefer-
able, since it does not recognize the
current situations as acceptable.

 

U.S. in Popularity Contest?

Another issue raised was the ques-
tion of whether or not the US.
should become the world’s self-
appointed missionary of “democracy”
or leader of a Holy Alliance of
Democracy. A final problem discuss-
ed was America’s reliance upon “a
popularity contest conception of
foreign policy.” Will we lead the
world, the speaker asked, or will
“world opinion” lead us?

Support Allies Regardless

These two points summarize Dr.
Futch’s argument, a main point of
which was that we should support
our allies whether or not they adopt
our form of government—Indo-
China, he noted, was never Thomas
Jefferson’s stamping ground any-
way ,and many peoples abroad could
not handle democracy even if they
acquired it. The means to the de-
sired ends as far as GOP is con-
cerned (with an eye to victory in
1964 or certainly in 1968) is for a
few shake-ups in Washington in
order to arrive at a sounder basis
for our foreign policy.

Honor Student

He was a member of both the Na-
tional Honor Society and the Key
Club, and a varsity letterman, ex-
celling in golf. For three years he
served as Norfolk’s outstanding high
school student and was elected out-
standing student at Granby each
of his four years in high school..

In his senior year Finestone was
elected Outstanding Teenager from
Granby High, and he was also se-
lected as a member of Granby’s
Hall of Fame. He was named the
most valuable student in the four
years he was there.

Mayor's Commission

Finestone also served on the Nor-
folk’s Mayor’s Youth Commission
and as a representative to a na-
tional conference on citizenship in
Washington, D.C.

So far this year at Washington and
Lee Finestone has joined the busi-
ness staff of the Calyx and the Ring-
tum Phi, and he is president of his
pledge class.

Shenandoah
Joins A.L.M.A.

Shenandoah, Washington and Lee
University’s quarterly literary mag-
azine, has become a member of the
Association of Literary Magazines of
America.

The national organization, form-
ed in November 1961, is designed
to increase the usefulness and
prestige of literary magazines in
the United States and Canada.
There are 36 literary magazines

represented in the association,
many of them college and Uni-
versity journals.

Prof. James Boatwright UI, editor
of Shenandoah and instructor in
English at the University, represent-
ed the magazine at the association’s
annual meeting October 11 and 12
in New York City.

The purpose of the Association of
Literary magazines of America is to
combat the concept that literary
magazines are private enterprises for
commercial ends, and to strengthen
the economic conditions and capa-
bilities of the magazines as a group.

 

RESEARCH GRANT

Will the student who asked Dr.
Colvin to get him a Robert E. Lee
Research Grant to study Indian arti-
facts please reveal his identity to Dr.
Colvin, who has forgotten who this
student is. The research grant has
been provided, and is waiting to be
awarded.

Pictures Taken

In Effort To
Promote WGL

More than 800 full-color pictures
were taken of the Washington and
Lee campus, faculty, and students
last week. Prior to last week a rep-
resentative from Guidance Associa-
tes in Pleasantville, N. Y., came to
W&L and took notes for a 12-inch
long-playing record to accompany
these pictures.

The project was originated by Mr.
Frank Parsons, Assistant to Presi-
dent Cole, with the idea of aiding
the Admissions Staff in promoting
W&L to high schools and prep
schools in the country.

Increasing Promotion

Many colleges have been increas-
ing the methods by which they reach
prospective students. One of these
is increased visitation by represen-
tatives of the individual college’s
admission staff. W&L has stepped
this phase of its promotional pro-
cedure in recent years.

Another method is the film-strip
and record, which can be sent out
to secondary schools for use in their
guidance departments. Guidance
Associates, Inc., which has done
film-strips and records for 50 schools
in the past two years including
Princeton, Brown, Cornell, Trinity,
Rutgers, Notre Dame, and the United
States Military Academy, is now
processing a film for W&L.

Editing Now Underway

Out of the 800 pictures exposed,
about 80 to 100 frames will be
chosen. A script for the frames will
be written from the notes made sev-
eral weeks ago. About 225 of these
“kits” will be purchased by the
school, and 25 will be held back to
send to alumni who might promote
the school in their region.

Many high schools and _ prep
schools now have special apparatus
for viewing these film-strips. The
record has tone-signals which tell
the operator when to flip the slide
to the next picture.

Once the film-strip and record are
complete, they will be used to sup-
plement our present promotional
programs, but they are not intended
to replace personal visitation.

f Panel Discussion And Concert

Highlight Weekend’s Activity

By HOWARD EPSTEIN
Tuesday Staff Reporter

The parents of nearly half of W&L’s student body will
get a closer look at campus life this weekend during the Uni-

Weekend.

More than 1,100 guests will begin arriving here Friday

*morning for a weekend designed to
provide them with opportunities to
attend classes, hold individual con-
ferences with faculty members, hear
reports from University and stu-
dent body officers, and visit with
their sons.

Washington and Lee and the 50-
member Parents’ Advisory Council
are co-sponsors of the weekend. The
annual meeting of the Council is
scheduled for Friday afternoon at
2:30 in the Student Union Building.
The chairman is Donald A. Holden
of Newport News, whose son is a
senior at the University.

The weekend officially gets under-
way Friday with registration at
10 am., and ends Saturday night
with a Glee Club concert at 8:30.

Campus Tour Slated

Among the top attractions on Fri-
day’s schedule will be tours of the
campus and Lee Chapel, recently
restored by the Ford Foundation for
$370,000. Visitors will have a chance
to see new exhibits in the Chapel’s
first-floor museum. Also during this
time an open house will be held in
the University’s $1,525,000 science
facilities—in full use for the first
time this year, and at 2:30 the W&L
Freshman Football team will play
Bridgewater College on Wilson Field.

Parents desiring conferences with
their sons’ professors will meet with
faculty members Friday afternoon
and Saturday morning. The confer-
ences, scheduled with the professors
by the students, have been one of
the most popular features of past
parents’ weekends. Parents are also
welcome to attend Friday and Sat-
urday morning classes.

A round of activities—including
faculty panel discussions, a demon-
stration debate and a peek at a play
rehearsal—are planned for the par-
ents’ first night in Lexington.

Panel Discussions

Ten faculty members will partici-
pate in three different panel discus-
sions between 8 and 9 p.m. Friday.
Dr. Jay D. Cook, professor of ac-
counting, Dr .Charles F. Phillips,
Jr., associate professor of economics,
and Prof. John F. DeVogt, instructor
in commerce, will discuss “The Pro-
posed Tax Cut: Its Effect on the
Economy.”

Three members of the English
faculty, Dr. Severn P. C. Duval, Dr.
Sidney M. B. Coulling, and Prof.
James Boatwright, will talk about
“Why Johnny Can’t Write” in an-
other discussion. The third panel
will focus on the topic “The Com-
puter in Action: Master or Slave?”
J. Baine Fox, director of the Uni-
versity’s Computer Center, Maj.
George W. Miller, associate profes-
sor of military science, Dr. J. Thomas
Ratchford, assistant professor of
physics, and Dr. John H. Wise, pro-
fessor of chemistry, will participate
in the discussion centered around
Washington and Lee’s newly
quired IBM 1960 computer.

ac-

Debaters To Perform
A demonstration debate by mem-
bers of the University’s prize-win-
ning debate team will get underway
at 8 p.m. Friday in the auditorium
of Lee Chapel. The student debaters
will argue the topic, “Resolved:
That Thomas Jefferson Would Be
Tried for Treason Today.” Also an
open rehearsal of the forthcoming
Troubadour production of “The Fire-
bugs” by Max Frisch is on tap be-
tween 8 and 9 p.m. Friday night at
the Troubadour Theater.

Question Of Tradition

Should Washington and Lee continue to condone
shoes without socks? . . . ties draped around the shoulders
and no more?...shirt-tails flapping in the breeze?
Should we? Because we are allowing many students of this
university to walk on campus and off in the various states
of undress just described.

In an address to student leaders, Bill Noell used an
analogy from the movie “Hud” which everyone should
remember: an old ranch owner has been forced to herd
his cattle into a giant trench and shoot them because they
all have contracted hoof-and-mouth disease. After the
cattle have been shot, bulldozers begin to fill the giant
grave.

The old man’s grandson says: “That didn’t take
long.” The old man says: “That’s right—it takes a mighty
long time to grow somethin’, but it don’t take long to kill
Ag

 

It has taken a long time to build up our tradition of
conventional dress on this campus. Some students may feel
it isnt a tradition any more—just a rule—and perhaps it
is. But even if it is a rule, we think it is a good one.
Four years ago coats and ties were a definite tradition—
and so, if that tradition has declined to the point of being
a mere rule, that decline has occurred because of the
disinterested attitude of the present student body.

A sure way to allow conventional dress to continue to
rot of the gangrene of apathy is to pay as little attention
to it as we have over the past three years. It is not the
Assimilation Committee, but the students, who must
maintain this tradition. We believe that most students
cherish the tradition of coats and ties, and want to keep
it strong. But just as the Honor System is kept strong by
the reporting of violations, so violations of conventional
dress must be reported in order for the tradition to be
continued.

Perhaps the Assimilation Committee should be given
more teeth; perhaps some of those who have so compla-
cently maligned the tradition of conventional dress should
be given a semester at home to think about it. Perhaps the
unwritten “bounds” of conventional dress (up to 10:30
week nights; up to 1 p.m. Saturdays; no exceptions on
campus at any time) should either be put down in black
and white so the Assimilation Committee would have
something definite to go on—or, these so-called time-
limits should be scrapped altogether, and the tradition
applied at all times day and night.

But surely, something must be done. We can’t allow
this problem to be “‘tabled”—either by the Executive
Committee or by the students.

O’Havra Dissects Soctety
In ‘From the Terrace’

John O’Hara: From the Terrace. (Bantam, $.95).
Reviewed by ROGER PAINE

From the Terrace is the most ambitious novel which John O'Hara
has ever tried to write. It is a book of near-epic proportions, in-
cluding detailed descriptions of over 100 characters, and moving
resolutely through the development of the United States over the
first half of the twentieth century.

Made into an entertaining movie which starred Paul Newman
and Joanne Woodward, From the Terrace as a novel needs editing.
The Bantam paperback is 981 pages of small print, and many of
those pages are not at all important to the development of the plot.
Yet the book is not dull, and from the standpoint of history, soci-
ology, and pure human interest, it comes off as a successful story.

Story of Alfred Eaton

The story centers around Alfred Eaton, a young man who grows
up in Port Johnson, Pennsylvania, not far from Gibbsville (the
scene of Ten North Frederick and O’Hara’s first novel, Appointment
at Samarra), Alfred’s father owns the local steel mill, which is the
center of Port Johnson’s economy. From the Terrace is Alfred’s
story, in that it describes the moment of his birth, his maturation,
his prep school and college days, the first sallies he makes into the
business world, all of his sexual relations, and his final collapse.

Typically O’Hara is the sexual description in the novel; as the
“Saturday Review” said: “O’Hara deals with sexual matters not
by any process of delicate allusion, but by the adducing of precise
physiological details.” Yet, the private lives of all Terrace’s charac-
ters are the major concern of the story, and O’Hara’s detailed des-
criptions of their sexual wants and fulfillments help to make the
characters more distinct.

Packed With Detail

A major criticism of the novel has been that it is too long. It is
packed with detail, to be sure, but O’Hara “is never stupidly un-
selective in his handling of facts; he makes them count,” according to
the “Saturday Review.” I agree with this. When O’Hara began col-
lecting material for the novel, he was more meticulous than one
would think possible. He spent six years thinking about his story and
gathering information: he talked to bankers, lawyers, Navy _men,
flyers, and he wrote dozens of letters to verify the smallest detail. He
received answers from scores of officials about planes in World War
I, the inner workings of Wall Street, and the precise wording on a
U.S. Navy death notice.

Alfred Eaton, coming from a well-to-do family, enters the world
of the moneyed. The problem of money is never in the forefront for
any of the major characters. O’Hara gives the reader a personalized
account in the in’s and out’s of Long Island society, small-town
society, politicos in Washington, D, C. and the elite of California.

Novel Has Broad Scope

Alfred lives a varied life, participates in many different things,
goes through two wives and a mistress, a job with a Wall Street
bank, a stint as Under Secretary of the Navy, O’Hara has the au-
thority to describe the social nuances of the very rich as no other
author of recent times has. His dialogue throughout the novel is
superb. His characterization, especially among many of the secondary

characters, is excellent.

Verse by James Ledbetter

 

Three Words an

e

She lit a cigarette and made the morning seem,

Eyes low, curtains drawn, nothing less than act of
treason.

“You always search for all, for death,” she said; “I never
knew

That something so diseased could be your aim.” Watch-
ing

Skin grow olive under flame, I knew what morning
brings

When honest eyes give thoughts of bed. “No,” she said,

Putting fingers to my lips, and sadly thought

How hard to say, you know that silence brings reward

But not to leave the thing unsaid—and so instead

She looked and said with eyes, don’t you know

I live to feel a harness eased,

Smell dead grass in old courtyards, feel nerves flutter

Under lack of reason,

Hear a dying bird, or know a change of season?

Black Snakes

I too went and heard the man say words;

People cried as if by pressed buttons,

And I was left with another kind of grief. Then

Told to see the mill, I got its keeper to show me

Where before a family feud had sent his father’s side
downstream

Brought half the country round, now a mild decay.

White-washed (twenty years ago) rooms empty,

Dust in which the black snakes (kept

to eat the rats) crept peeling,

The smell of a cellar. The stone, and then

The broken race, atonic, the whole place unpronounced

Death and the old man talking.

Feeling vaguely sick and like another lovely cipher

(Musty cider with pinhead bubbles), I felt

The path away and waning, remarked the stone foun-
dation.

Wondering what they wanted me to think. Lady

da Black Snake

After seeking renaissance and atonement,
Sitting and eating your bitter tears of honey,
Still I see the man at the lonely table
Trying to take from a cigarette

What it cannot give.

A Minor Vanity

Now we grow tired of words,

Our bodies break like flood-tides
Crushing sediment and clay,
Mirrows break, and lungs pull in
To exorcise the winter’s sin,
Achieve the day, and leave the hour
Unbeconable, unmitigated.

Loves born in past months sing
Framed in their memories of blue ice,
Exchanged, repaid,

For habits dead and dying. You
Think bad of me; forgive

A minor vanity,

Unnatural in our cold month,

That loves to twist meaning.

Three Words

Modern Man sits in chloroform coolness

Striking images in walls of prismatic mirror.
The mind is dissected with clockwork precision.
Doors close. No words are needed. Indeed,

Until the clever instruments are packed away
One by one in pads and folds of cotton,

Until the castration is effected, the tuned
Attitudes captured, translated into every tongue,
Transmuted, and all the surgeons faceless,

One by one, lie down in each his separate space
Only three words will be possible. Only three,
And if you will come closer, incline your ear to mine,
Listen now, I will tell them to you.

 

Dance Board Offers

‘Lousy’ Performers

Say Student Hold-Outs On Dance Plans

Last week a letter from the Dance

Board was passed out at all the
Fraternity houses on campus, and
the lead question was “What does
a Dance Plan Have to Offer You?”
Since we were very interested to
know we read the letter carefully,
and then added it to the rest of the
material accumulated from official
and unofficial sources begging every-
body to buy a Dance Plan before
the social structure of the University
fell down about our ears. Unfor-
tunately ,we were still negatively
impressed with what a Dance Plan
had to offer us.

Entertainment Poor

It is well to point out at first that
the main reason we have not, and
will not buy a Dance Plan is for the
simple reason that we believe the
entertainment is lousy. Performers,
just like books or movies, are ex-
tremely controversial, and, therefore
a Dance Plan purchase on this basis
is strictly individual. However, we
feel that the Dance Board has been
negligent in not only the entertain-
ment they have contracted but the
lack of any kind of continuity in
the entertainment, and the weak
foundation of their appeal to the stu-
dent body to bail them out of hot
water.

When we received the summer
letter of the Dance Board, we were
interested in not only the entertain-
ment that was definite, but the pro-
posed entertainment that was still
tentative. In this way we might be
able to discern some general trend in
the type, or types, of entertainment
that the Dance Board was interested

in. We discovered no real trend, ex-
cept perhaps one toward chaos
(which they prefer to call diversity),
and what was there was not very
impressive. It was immediately evi-
dent to both of us that we would
rather run the cross-country course
(and for us this would be extremely
unfavorable) than sit through more
than 30 minutes of Stan-the-Man
Rubin’s “Big” Ochestra and Dakota
Staton (especially together).

Ray Charles

In the latest Dance Board epistle
we were not surprised to find that
they were interested in Ray Charles.
Who isn’t? But we were surprised
to find that they actually thought
they could get him here. This would
call for a complicated arrangement
with other schools in this area to
hire him on successive nights—so
complex an arrangement that it de-
fies description, but, more power to
them. If Ray Charles did come, we
would gladly pay the $8.50 at the
door, and feel we were realizing a
saving of $21.50.

Responsibility With Board

What is more galling than anything
else, however, is the Dance Board’s
approach to student body support.
They come to us and say, “if you
give us $30 we will try and get some
good bands down here.” They make
it clear that the burden of respon-
sibility rests with us. In the past it
has been the Dance Board’s res-
ponsibility to give the student body
a definite idea of what type of en-
tertainment they will get. It is not
our responsibility to blindly follow
wherever they wish to lead. They

are selling a product, not collecting
for charity. And, essentially, if the
Dance Plans do not sell well, it is
not because of the $5 hike in cost,
but because the product is not worth
$30. It certainly is not worth it to
us.

However, we hope it is clear that
we have supported the Dance Board
in the past, and we look forward to
doing so in the future, but we cannot
support them at this time. We owe
them no obligation—but they defi-
nitely have an obligation to the stu-
dent body. We feel that the “pres-
tige of Washington and Lee’s social
life” depends more on their planning
than on our wildly spending our
money for something we’re not sure
we'll get, and not even sure we want
it.

Need a Good Product

The Dance Board reminds us that
“You get what you pay for and pay
for what you get.” We feel that if

Coun Sywire:

By A. L. BROCKENBROUGH

Wednesday, October 16

Today I strolled across the longest
concrete footbridge in the world, and
wondered why it was. Perhaps no
other civilization has thought about
building such a long bridge out of
concrete. At the end of the bridge,
and to the right, was a sophomore
gym class in session. Sprawled out
in a long line, the students were

driving golf balls down the field
which is adjacent to the football
field.

Drawing a little closer, I discov-
ered the exact procedure which was
being followed by the class. Each
student had three golf balls. After
hitting these balls, each golfer would
wait until the other golfers had
taken their turns. And then, in
something which is reminiscent of
the Oklahoma land rush, the long
line of students, dressed in street
clothes, charged down the field to
retrive not one—not two—but three
golf balls.

The process was then repeated.
I can’t deny that there is some value
to hitting a golf ball, but consider-
ing the other parts of the game
which are involved, I can’t see how
this process will enable many of the
students to play a respectable round
of golf on the Lexington Country
Club course, which they have to
do after nothing more than the ex-
ercise I have just described.

Thursday, October 17

The day before Openings—but
there doesn’t seem to be much en-
thusiasm. Could it be that since
Openings will be the fourth party
weekend in a row, students can’t
quite “get up” for the game?

Friday, October 18

It’s a disappointing sign of the
times—in the Friday Edition of the
paper, the list of houseparties over
the weekend indicated that six par-
ties were closed. These six parties
involve nine of the eighteen frater-
nities on campus. Two or three years
ago, there was no such thing as a
closed party at W&L, except in the
instances of the traditional Christmas
and spring parties.

The fact that no parties were
closed in those days gave W&L on
a party weekend the spirit of hospi-
tality. Anybody could go anywhere;
no one was barred at any door. Now,
guests from other schools as well
as our own students are turned
away by irresolute bouncers. The
reason: fraternities are hiring com-
bos which require an investment of
$500.00 or more for a mere four
hours of entertainment. Understand-
ably, they want to have to cope only

Pace Reviews
Antonioni Films

As Excellent

By TOM PACE

Recently the film “L’Avventura,”
by Michelangelo Antonioni, was se-
lected in a polling of seventy inter-
national critics as the second best
movie of all time. Even more re-
cently Antonioni’s second major ef-
fort, “La Notte,” received several
prizes as the best film of 1962.
It has occurred to me that it might
better serve my time if I were to
explain to you what makes a film
seem great to me and why the cine-
ma is the medium of the director.

Antonioni has produced in the last
four years a trilogoy which has pre-
sented to his audiences the primary
problem that confronts his own per-
son, and that problem’s resolution.
He strips this problem bare; he sets
it in an intellectual wealthy class
which is concerned with nothing
other than finding something worth
the task of living.

His first step, and by far the
finest film of the three, “L’Avven-
tura,” assumes that wealth, re-
ligion, position, etec., don’t give
man a real fulfillment. He does, in
fact, assume that the only thing
that might is a relationship of
meaning between two people. In
this first film he shows a man and

Big, Fast Susquehanna Snaps Generals’ Win Skein, 31-0

Potent Susquehanna rolled up 383
yards rushing, and used four differ-
ent backs to score Saturday in
their 31-0 rout of W&L, who was
previously undefeated.

The Generals were the victims of
a team so powerful that Susque-
hanna fullback Larry Kerstetter was
named to the Associated Press’s All-
Pennsylvania team last year along
with the best from Pitt and Penn
State.

It was only the second defeat for
W&L in its last 32 games.

Susquehanna scored in every per-
iod on runs of two yards by Kerstet-
ter, 11 yards by halfback John Vig-

 

none, four yards by halfback Larry
E.rdman and 42 yards by reserve
quaterback Sam Metzger.

Starting quarterback Don Green
added five more points by running
two conversions and kicking an-
other.

W&L mounted its only serious
threat in the fourth quarter by driv-
ing from its own 26 to the Sus-
quehanna one where it gave up the
balls on downs. They trailed 16-0 at
the half.

Depth-strong, Susquehanna beat
the Five Star Generals at its own
game. Platooning superbly against

the W&L blue and red units, Sus-
quehanna stopped them with only 84
yards on the ground and showed
that even with a very good day,
W&L would have come out on the
short end of the score.

This was the first time a W&L
team has been shut out since 1959.

Susquehanna’s initial score came
when they recovered a loose for-
ward lateral after a screen pass put
the Generals deep into enemy terri-
tory.

After a 40-yard jaunt by their
starting scatback, Vignone ran over
from the 11 for the score. When

 

this starting scatback, who was in-
jured, was replaced by Erdman,
Susquehanna’s backfield averaged
almost 200 pounds, and showed ex-
cellent speed. Their line averaged
nearly 220 pounds and the Generals’
guards knew it.

W&L halfback Stu Yoffe with
only 20 yards in 11 carries and Hen-
ry Sackett with only 19 yards in 9
carries were the victims of the
moose-like Susquehanna line.

Yoffe caught two passes for 52
yards. Johnny MacDaniel was the
leading Genertals’ rusher with 36
yards in four attempts.

Hampden-Sydney is next on the
list for the Generals.

Light Brigade In Initial Win, 21-0,
Over AMA On Kendrick’s Passes

By DAVID SHUFFLEBARGER

Before their big brothers on the varsity were losing for
the first time this season, W&L’s Light Brigade romped to its
initial triumph by downing Augusta Military Academy here
Friday, 21-0 on the strength cof an outstanding second-half

 

Cross-Country Team Bows, 21-34,
To Old Dominion; O’Connor Stars

Talented Old Dominion College, with the advantage of
its own track, ended W&L’s bid for an undefeated cross-
country season Friday by stopping the Generals, 21-34.

Riff O’connor finished five seconds behind the first O.D.C.
runner, with freshman Bill Wildrick and co-captain Andy Kil-
patrick second and third men for W&L respectively. Charlie

 

 

show.

The Brigadiers now stand with a
1-2 ledger while AMA is winless in
four starts. The Augusta team was
the same one, except for a powerful
205-pound fullback, that bumped off
W&L, 19-6, last year.

A defensive battle dominated by
the Light Brigade took place in the
scoreless first half. Stellar line play
kept the Augusta team from getting
anywhere near the W&L goal.

Coach Dana Swan’s charges rallied
in the third quarter with a couple
of scores on long bombs by Bryant
Kendrick. First the ace quarterback
tossed a wobbly pass deep towards
the far side of the field. Hendrick-
son raced from his left end spot
straight downfield with a slant to-
wards the middle, grabbed the ball
from two defenders, cut to his right
and scored after a short jaunt. After
two penalties the extra point was
run from 4% yard out.

Later in the period Kendrick
dropped back, looked downfield,
then fired to his right to the near
side of the gridiron to Johnny Gra-
ham on a screen pass. Graham, with
a host of blockers, tight-roped the
sideline for the score.

5-0 Rout Of

After a tight opening half in which
they took a 1-0 lead, Washington
and Lee’s soccer team broke out of
a two-game losing streak Friday by
stomping Virginia Tech, 5-0, here.

In one of the most aggressive
games the Generals have played this
year, halfback Wes Horner proved to
be the mainstay as usual.

Horner broke the scoring in the
first half when he took a kick in

The O.D.C. runners were aided

is longer and has many hills, and

SPORTS

SHUFFLIN’ ALONG

By DAVID SHUFFLEBARGER

Well, there goes another football victory streak down the
drain, but may I suggest that although they lost the game, the
men on the football team have no reason to lose any of their
pride.

In Susquehanna, the Generals faced a team that the top
national sports magazine predicted would naturally fall into the
number two small college spot behind Wittenberg. When a
small, non-subsidized college like W&L attempts to match
brawn and skill that can be brought to Susquehanna, only a
mis-match can result.

Although this was a pretty good Susquehanna team, it
was an outstanding Washington and Lee team despite the fact
that they didn’t play their best ball. Now let your thoughts
drift to next year when graduation steals the whole blue team
offense. Susquehanna won’t have slipped much since their
money is pretty consistent, and W&L may be very glad that it
has only a two-year schedule with the Susquehanna eleven.

This is not saying that we should regret ever schedueling
the Susquehanna team, for I think it was a very good thing.
It shows that W&L is not afraid to play the best around and
can give them a good run for their money any day of the week.
However, it seems to me that a policy of competing with only
non-subsidized and lightly-subsidized teams might be very
profitable to W&L football.

The main reason we joined the C.A.C. was to get in a
league where we could enjoy good non-subsidized competition.

And if we therefore favor those teams that play for the
sport of the game, then why don’t we schedule just those teams
that don’t subsidize, with the possible exception of Randolph-
Macon and Hampden-Sydney which are old rivals on the
schedule and subsidize ever so lightly.

Agreed there aren’t that many non-subsidized teams in the
nation, but I don’t think it would be too hard to get a schedule
that would prove very interesting without creating any lopsided
contests.

SHORT SHUFFLES—Frank Parsons tells us that con-
trary to popular belief Upsala is not the Green Bay Packers
second unit. Upsala, which upended Susquehanna, 21-0,
early in the season to break a 22-game win skein, was the last
team to beat the Susquehanna men before the streak started.
They capitalized on seven fumbles and three interceptions to
play their nemsis role to the hilt.

Congratulations to Dana Swan’s frosh on their first tri-
umph, a rousing 21-0 win. The newly-formed band will be
on hand for this week’s game against the Bridgewater J.V.’s.

Antonioni Explores Love As Key

To Existence In

(Continued from page 2)

woman hoping, searching, trying
fer a complete communication with
one another. He beautifully, but
painfully asserts that such com-
munication, or a real love is im-
possible ;that the highest feeling
one may have for another is true,
selfless, and personal pity.

His second film begins with this
fact established. The man and wo-
man have not realized a relation-
ship based on love. He allows them
both to try again, with someone
new, only to bring them together at
the finish, the man forcing the wo-
man to submit to his sexual wants,
with her resisting until she too ad-
mits her own desires.

The third film is named “L’Eclise”
(The Eclipse) and is a great disap-
pointment cinematically. Nonetheless
it does present Antonioni’s resolu-
tion to the problem. It begins with
a man and woman breaking off an
affair. Symbolically, this man and
woman are the same that were to-
gether at the end of “La Notte,” the
second step. The woman is the per-
son who is most dissatisfied. She
goes out to look for something new,
something different, something that
will give her fulfillment. She fails
in her attempt and grabs hold of
a man she meets while failing.

At first they seem happy. Yet
we soon discover that she is grow-
ing weary of him, that he too, does
not consider her first among his
many concerns. But then he, An-
tonioni, gives his answer. With a
shrug of the woman’s shoulders,
we are told simply, “What else is
there?” The unanswered question
is its own answer.

Antonioni has slowly, artistically
presented a theme of major signifi-
cance. And what is more important
he has done so cinematically. His
technical talents are unquestionable.

 

| evokes the precise atmosphere nec-

Three Films

He composes each scene carefully,

essary, and uses and guides actors
who are extremely adaptable to his
thematic intent. His on fault is, I
think, his failure to use the camera
more. It is a tool of much potential
but Antonioni seems to shy away
from taking advantage of it. Per-
haps he felt that his subjects re-
quired little motion of camera, but
if so this only implies that his story
is less suited to the medium which
he has chosen than it should have
been.

Horner teamed with veteran Bruce
Jackson to give the Generals an out-
standing halfback combination. Jack-
son played a stellar game.

W&L exhibited its usual running
game and added some sharp short
passes to smooth the offense.

In the second half the booters
rallied with four goals, one each by
Jimmy Mell, Henry, Steve Hibbard,
and Praben Berthelsen.

Ironically, Coach Joe Lyles pre-
dicted the score. He used his pla-

At midnight Saturday when Lloyd

was still a sizeable crowd in Dore-

freshman reaction to the dance was
one I overheard: “Y’know, this isn’t
as bad as everybody said it was go-
ing to be.” The dance was a reason-
able success; the Lloyd Price band
was excellent.

Saturday night at the Roy Hamil-

‘From The Tarrace’ Criticized For Lack Of Feeling

(Continued from page 2)

Many of the very rich and very
powerful men of the past century
parade across the pages of From the
Terrace. To go once again to the
“Saturday Review”: “Fiction offers
no more carefully documented ac-

count of American life in the first} -

half of the twentieth century than
From the Terrace. The operations
of a private New York bank, the
number of suicides in the depression
and the intrigues of wartime Wash-
ington are part and parcel of the
novel.”

Novel Fails As Tragedy

Perhaps the novel’s main fault is
that it is billed as a tragedy. Alfred
Eaton is not, however, a very big
man at any point in the story; and,
his decline is so carefully outlined
in the last 200 pages of the novel
that we can see the end in sight long
before we get there. If O’Hara’s
tragedy does not come off, it is part-
ly because Alfred did not have very
far to fall, and partly because we
do not really know him, even after

that this has been in some way con-

occur until 1968, but why wait until the last moment? Besides, we have already struck a medal (see above). The
cloth in the shirt upon which the medal is hanging is also named after her: Afflerbach Cloth. It is made in
Switzerland to her specifications, which are 20% wool and 80% cotton. Her reasoning is interesting. She wanted
enough wool to make it very soft, but enough cotton to make it light and washable. Any more wool than
