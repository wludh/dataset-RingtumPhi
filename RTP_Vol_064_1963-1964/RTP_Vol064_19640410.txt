ODK_ 50th

The Secretary of State, two uni-
versity presidents, and a famous
explorer and mountain climber high-
light the list of speakers to appear
at the 50th anniversary national
convention of Omicron Delta Kappa,
honorary leadership society.

Approximately 200 delegates from
110 circles of the society will at-
tend the golden anniversary meet-
ing in Roanoke and Lexington April
23 to 209.

Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
who was tapped for membership in
Omicron Delta Kappa as an under-
graduate at Davidson College, will
give the major address at the con-
vention’s opening convocation
Thursday evening, April 23, at Hotel
Roanoke.

Friday, Avril 24, the convention
will make an all day pilgrimage to
Washington and Lee University,
Lexington, where Omicron Kappa
Delta was founded in 1914.

Dean Rusk To Highlight

Anniversary

a convention luncheon that day in
Evans Dining Hall.

A model initiation service and a
recognition of the founders of the
society will follow in Lee Chapel on
Washington and Lee’s’ campus.
Alumnus Dr. Edgar F. Shannon, Jr.,
president of the University of Vir-
ginia will give the main speech.

The convention closes Saturday
morning with the report of com-
mittees, legislative action and the
election and installation of new of-
ficers.

Before being appointed to his cab-
inet post in 1961 by the late Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy, Secretary
Rusk served as president of the
Rockefeller Foundation for nine
years. Previously he was professor
of political science and government
and Dean of Faculty at Mills College
and held positions in the War De-
partment and Department of State.
He served as an infantry officer in

for president of Fancy Dress.

Delta Tau Delta and Sigma Phi
Epsilon joined the University
Party last night after an unexpect-
ed withdrawal from the Progres-
sive Party.

Their shift drastically altered the
balance of power in campus poli-
tics, adding approximately 110
votes to the University Party and
making it the majority party. The
University Party now has eleven
houses as opposed to the Progres-
sive Party’s seven.

The switching seemly came as
a surprise to both parties. When
the Progressive Party clique meet-
ing broke up at about 1:30 last
night, no one except the Delt and
SPE representatives were aware of
an impending split with the Pro-
gressive Party.

Jim Kulp President

Kulp, a student of the W&L Law
School, is the intermediate law class
representative to the Executive
Committee. He is a member of the
Law Review and of Phi Delta Phi
law fraternity. Kulp was selected
as a member of ODK this year.

Before coming to W&L, Kulp was
an honor student at Hampden-Syd-
ney. There he was elected first as
secretary-treasurer of the student
body, and later as vice president of
the student body. He has sat on the
honor council, and served as presi-
dent of both his social fraternity
and Chi Beta Phi, honorary scientific
fraternity.

from Kenilworth, Illinois, is a Dean’s

DeYoung, Morris, Adams
Named by Revamped Party

The University Party, last night, nominated Jim Kulp, a
second-year law student, as its candidate for president of the
student body. The party, at its clique meeting held at the Beta
house, also nominated Jim DeYoung for student body vice-
president, Malcolm Morris for secretary, and Patton Adams

 

A past president of his social fra-
ternity, DeYoung is a member of the
SWMSFC’s, the Student Service So-
ciety, and the Varsity Club.

De Young is captain of the tennis
team and is the Illinois state dele-
gation chairman of the Mock Con-
vention. He has been a vice pres-
ident of the Fancy Dress Dance Set
for the last two years.

Malcolm Morris Secretary

James Malcolm Morris, a Sig Ep
from Richmond, is an Executive
Committeeman from the junior class
this year. In his sophomore year,
he served as president of his class.

Morris is a member of ODK and
Tau Kappa Alpha, honorary frater-
nities, and is a McElwee Scholarship
holder.

Morris has been a member of the
Dance Board and the Cold Check
Committee. He worked on the Ring-
tum Phi for two years, and was a
Glee Club officer. He presently
serves as secretary of the UCA.

A Dean’s List and Honor Roll
student, Morris is a member of Phi
Eta Sigma. He has held several fra-
ternity offices and is a freshman
dorm counselor this year.

Patton Adams FD President

Thomas Patton Adams, a Pi Phi
junior has been nominated as the
University Party’s Fancy Dress
Presidential candidate. His home is
Columbia, South Carolina.

Adams is chairman of the South
Carolina state delegation for the
Mock Convention. He has served as
an officer of his class, as an officer
of his house, and as an Interfraterni-
ty Councilman. In addition, he has
worked on the Ring-tum Phi.

A Dean’s List student and Robert
E. Lee research scholar, Adams re-
cently won a statewide essay con-
test.

In an interview, University Party
Clique Chairman Al Eckes explained
the reasons for the action of the
Delt and SPE houses: “In the in-
terest of a more capable, highly ex-
perienced student government, the
Delt and SPE houses have realigned
with the University Party.

“The purpose of this movement is
to extend to the student body a
definite choice in the coming elec-
tion for President, Vice-President,
Secretary, of the Student Body and
for the President of Fancy Dress, a
choice in which the University Party
offers capable and experienced can-
didates .

“It is the feeling of both the old
and new members of the University
Party that without this change, the
student body would not have been
confronted with a single or collective
slate of able people who offer both
the experience and stability essential
to those whom we select to govern
and represent the Washington and
Lee Student Body.

“For the above obvious and self-
explanatory reasons, the necessary

 

realignment was accomplished.”

A Modest Proposal

This coming week, as in every previous W&L election,
many constructive ideas and proposals will be projected before
the student body through the platforms of the respective
political parties. However, many of the desperately needed
reforms can be carried out only through a closer liaison of
student body officers and the Board of Trustees. With this in
mind, we'd like to throw out the following as possible platform

issues for ’64.

1. That the new officers sponsor a student petition to be
presented to the trustees at their meeting next month request-
ing that they state their position on segregation.

2. That a report be presented to the trustees giving an hon-
est appraisal of W&L fraternities and recommending the
institution of a long-range plan for their elimination.

3. That the new officers formally request of the trustees
a decent and well-situated Co-op, preferably the remodeling
and re-opening of the Old Co-op. .

4. That the University no-drinking rule be modified to per-
mit the consumption of alcoholic beverages at the University

dances.

 

 

 

Letters To The Editor...

 

 

Dear Sir:

Because Mr. Lewis has ventured
to comment twice on U.S. medical
standards, I will reply briefly to
his remarks on my one column.

Lewis on Durrette: “Mr. Durrette’s
argument implied...our system
should not be changed” and that
“this is analogous to stating that
the Boston Celtics, perennial cham-
pions in the NBA, should not try
to improve, for they are the best
already!” (emphasis added).

Durrette on Durrette: “Let us,
then, work diligently to correct the
imperfections of our system rather
than discard it...”

Note, Mr. Lewis, the difference be-
tween change and improve; appar-
ently it escaped you.

I do not deny that the cost of
medical care has risen, but your
statistical comparison is inaccurate
and incomplete. First, you should
measure medical services against
services in  general—not against
goods and services. The difference
is striking.

Second, most of the cost rise is
concentrated in hospital cost and
thus, hospital insurance. Drugs, pre-
scriptions drugs, doctor’s and den-
tists fees have risen little more than
services over-all for the period you
cited. Considering the “profit hun-
gry” drug industry now spends over
$100 million more per year for re-
search than in 1956, the slight price
increase is phenomenally moderate.

 

Third, most medicines are cheaper
in terms of real cost in the US.,
than they are abroad. That is, an
American worker has to work less
time than his foreign counterpart
to purchase drugs which are priced
higher for him in dollar value.

Finally, in 1939 the average pre-
scription price was $1.11, but it took
the average manufacturing employee
1 hour and 45 minutes of working
time to pay for it. In 1960 the aver-
erage prescription price was $3.00
but it took only 1 hour and 21 min-
utes to pay this price.

Perhaps the rise in hospital cost
is cause for concern, but I cannot
knowledgably comment. However,
expanding, advanced and moderized
services and equipment may be some
justification. Also, as Mr. Lewis indi-
cated in his first column, these fees
are utilized in many areas to sup-
port the medically indigent.

As to the deficiency in “conserva-
tive reasoning” of which my “black
or white” analysis is an example, I
offer this: either socialized medicine
is superior to our system or it is
not. Color it as you will, but the
alternatives are clear. If this is
“black or white reasoning” I plead
guilty.

If you insist on experimenting in
socialized medicine, Mr. Lewis,
please pursue it first on a State level
so that should unfortunate results
follow, your guinea pigs will have

Reason & the Traditional Church

We discussed in the second part
of our series (March 27) the pre-
carious position of the Church as
its appeal te young people is
seriously diminishing. Below, we
probe behind this and other con-
temporary .symptoms .of  ..the
Church’s ill-health in order to ex-
amine a movement that has be-

come a_ historical landmark of
Christianity’s decline—the Protes-
tant Reformation.
By KEN LANE
Editor-in-Chief

The series of religious, political
and social revolutions we know of
as the Protestant Reformation has
been the decisive impetus for the
advent of the modern world. It
was this era that represented the
transition from the Dark Ages of
dogma and intellectual stalemate to

 

the Renaissance of science and rea-
son, from blind adherence to au-
thority to the spirit of individualism
and independence, from the Church-
dominated, religion-centered exist-
ence under Catholicism to modern-
day secularism and mundane enter-
prise.

Reason and Revelation

A prominent feature of this trans-
ition was that reason began to sup-
ersede divine revelations as _ the
guide to human thought and action.
The Church and the Bible no longer
served as the final answer for the
enquiring. The simple universe
of heaven, hell, and earth suddenly
became excitingly more complex.
From this change of outlook resulted
two significant developments.

The first was the growth of scien-
tific inquiry. Throughout history,

 

Christianity has been, and in many
cases continues to be, in strong op-
position to scientific advance. For
this is the religion that represents
knowledge as a slimy, despicable
snake which, because it had lured
man from his pristine ignorance, had
been the instigating factor of the
world’s evils. It is not surprising,
then, that the Church had sought
to dispel such crucial findings as the
Copernican theory, or that it should
have damned the humanists for
spreading literacy and teaching the
layman how to reason. (This retard-
ing influence of the Church has its
twentieth-century parallel in the
fervid opposition of the clergy to
the theory of organic evolution.)

Loss of Authority
Secondly, the rise of reason began
to undermine the keystone of eccles-

 

 

fo oe
APGAR.

iastical authority. For it was through
its prerogatives over men’s souls
that the Church had exercised pow-
er against any authority that might
compete with it. It could thus frigh-
ten recalcitrants with threats of per-
petual damnation and bind the
amenable with promises of eternal
bliss. As reason sowed the seeds
of skepticism, however, this bond
of authority commenced to dissolve.

The institution that increasingly
supplanted the authority of the
Church was the State, which found
its sanction not in religion but in
nature. “The great and chief end
of men uniting into commonwealths
and putting themselves under gov-
ernment is the preservation of prop-
erty,” stated John Locke. Thus, the
Church and State began to separate
and compartmentalize, each with its
own sphere of interest. The univer-
sal hierarchy of values of the Mid-
dle Ages, with obedience to the
Church at the apex, broke down
into two parallel and different sys-
tems as the criterion of the State
became not religious authority, but
political expidency.

A further development that was
eventually to take all of Christianity
within its mold was the rise of cap-
italism. No system could be more in
contradiction to the original theol-
ogy of Christianity than a creed
based on self-gain at the expense
of one’s fellows .The result is the

striking dichotomy between “the
concept of society as a community
of unequal classes with varying

functions, organized for a common
end, and that which regards it as a
mechanism adjusting itself through
the play of economic motives to the
supply of economic needs; between
the idea that a man must not take
advantage of his neighbor’s neces-
sity, and the doctrine that ‘man’s
self-love is God’s providence,’ be-
tween the attitude which appeals to
a religious standard to repress eco-
nomic appetites, and that which re-
gards expediency as the final cri-
terion.” (Paul Tawney, Religion and
the Rise of Capitalism). Clearly,
Christianity and capitalism could
not coexist without one or the
other making serious compromises in
its underlying credo. Needless to
say, Christianity was the one that
yielded and capitalism won out over
most of the West.

NEXT WEEK: Part four will
take a look at the contemporary
American church,

We continue to welcome letters of
comment on the above from both
faculty and students. All letters in-
cluding ones we have received over
the past weeks will be published in
next Friday’s issue.

 

Mock Convention’s Major Decision:
‘When And If To Drop Goldwater?’

The major question Washington
and Lee University’s Mock Repub-
lican Convention May 4 and 5 faces
is: if and when to leave Goldwater.

Reports from state and national
Republican leaders show the con-
vention’s leaders that Goldwater
now has more votes than any other
GOP presidential hopeful, but no-
body knows if his lead is strong

enough to pull in the undecided
delegations.
Washington and Lee students

themselves have been keeping long
distance telephone lines hot, the
mails full, reading everything they
can get their hands on and even
fanning out across the country dur-
ing spring vacation last week to find
the answer.

In this year of great uncertainty
about the name of the Republican
presidential nominee, the Mock Con-
vention’s long record of accuracy is
facing one of its toughest tests.

Eight Correct

Twelve Mock Conventions have
been held at Washington and Lee in
presidential election years for the
party out of power. Eight times
student delegates have correctly
picked the nominee later chosen by
the national convention.

The Mock Conventions have been
right the last three times, accu-
rately selecting Eisenhower, in 1952,
Stevenson in 1956 and John F. Ken-
nedy in 1960, and for almost a year
now, state delegation chairmen have
been working to insure another ac-
curate prediction May 5.

As the Mock Convention Steering
Committee’s Republican Party Chair-
man, senior law school student
Wyatt Durrette, Jr., has the task of
directing this prediction.

 

National Liasion

Last summer he spent several
weeks in Washington establishing
liaison with Republican national

headquarters and getting letters of
introduction for the 50 Mock Con-
vention state chairmen. The state
chairmen, appointed last spring, be-
gan making contacts with political
leaders in their states last summer.

For example, John Heinzerling, a
senior from Houston, is chairman of
the Texas delegation. Last summer
he met with Marvin Collins, execu-
tive director of the Texas Republi-
can Party who was “a tremendous
amount of help in introducing me to
Republican leaders in Houston, Dal-
las and other parts of the state,”
Heinzerling said.

He added that finding out who
Texas Republicans will vote for
“was not at all much of a problem
because it’s pretty clear cut. Al-
most every Republican in Texas is
extremely conservative and _ for
Goldwater,” he said.

The chief problem Heinzerling |
faces is whether the delegation will
stay with Goldwater all the way
through. “The Republican leaders
are reluctant to give much advice
about a deadlock between Gold-
water and another candidate, but I
generally feel the delegation will

stay with Goldwater all the way
through,” he said.
Maryland for Goldwater
Bill Schildt, a Washington and

Lee senior from Hagerstown, Md.,
approached his chairmanship of the
Mock Convention’s Maryland dele-
gation differently. Last summer he
worked for Rep. Charles Mathias of
the state’s Sixth Congressional Dis-

 

trict which includes everything from

a large District of Columbia Suburb
to rural Western Maryland. Travel-
ing with Rep. Mathias, Schildt “saw
lots of grass roots support for
Goldwater.

“Goldwater is ahead in Maryland
now, but the lead is to be question-
ed because people seem to be look-
ing for someone else to go to. I
think they would like to turn to
Nixon,” he said.

Illinois’ Pick

As chairman of the Mock Con-
vention’s Illinois delegation, Jim
DeYoung, a junior from the Chicago
suburb of Kenilworth, is having
to follow closely the race for the
GOP nomination for governor of
Illinois.

First DeYoung explains that Gold-
water “has strong support down-
state, but Chicago is more vague.”

 

Second he explains that whoever |

captures the GOP nomination for
governor will possibly exert a strong
influence on

tion.

The front runner for this nomina-
tion, Illinois Secretary of State
Charles F. Carpentier, withdrew
from the race in January after suf-
fering a heart attack. He died last
week,

But hours before his death, Car-
pentier wrote a letter to Republi-
can leaders in the state praising
candidate Charles Percy, Chicago
industrialist, and attacking Percy’s
rival as a “voluble young man.”

And from working in Percy’s
campaign last summer, DeYoung
believes Perey prefers Rockefeller.
But so far Percy’s only public state-
ment on this subject says he will

the state’s delegation |
to the Republican National Conven- |

 

support whoever wins the state’s
primary April 14. Goldwater and
Sen. Margaret Chase Smith are the
only candidates entered in the pri-
mary.

And so it goes all across the coun-
try and Washington and Lee “poli-
ticians” are following every shift,
subtle and obvious,

Overall Picture

Looking at the overall picture,
Durrette says he thinks Goldwater
“will have upwards of 400 votes
on the first ballot” at the Mock Con-
vention.

Also Durrette says he is weighing
heavily on two other factors: al-
most no political writers believe
Goldwater has a chance at the
nomination; and while influential
Republicans in the northeast might
not be able to control the nomina-
tior, they perhaps can stop Gold-
wter.

But already Durrette is instruct-
ing Mock Convention's state chair-
men: “Find out what your state
will do if Goldwater starts losing
on the second, third or fourth bal-
lot.

Nobody will know the real an-
swer until the convention actually
nominates a candidate because the
situation will continue to change
right up to the last minute. State
delegation chairmen will have tele-
phones right on the convention
floor with direct lines to their Re-
publican contacts in the states they
represent to receive these last min-
ute instructions.

Then, and only then, will the
Mock Convention and the national
press covering it know “when and if
they’ll leave Goldwater.”

Two Games
Called; Meet
Bridgewater

The Washington and Lee baseball
team returns to action tomorrow
here against Bridgewater, after two
rained-out games this past week.

The Generals were slated to meet

The spring trip saw the Generals
lose six of seven games, due to a
pitcher shortage (only four were
healthy), poor hitting (.185 overall
batting average) and inexperience
(12 of 25 players are freshmen).

The infield was struck a blow
when third-baseman Louie Paterno
(.250 batting average) was forced
to quit because of grades. Lou
Flanagan will switch to third, and
Mike Saunders will replace him at
second.

Ashley Allen leads the team in
hitting, with a 308 average. Catcher
Tom Crenshaw is second at .273.
Wigert leads the pitchers with a
3.04 earned run average.

The Generals have stolen 12
bases against college competition.
Dave Kirkpatrick has five, Allen
three.

Three RBI’s by Jim Crothers and
two by Scott Miller gave W&L the
Fort Lee victory. Gamber went the
distance after pitching three innings
the day before.

Lyles credited balanced fielding,
without the usual passed balls and
wild pitches, for the victory.

Hofstra Down;
Now To Duke

By PAT ADAMS
The Washington and Lee lacrosse
team will meet Duke tomorrow at
Durham, N.C. The Blue Devils are

|| still an unknown quantity so far

as this season is concerned. This
will be their season opener.

Coach Bob McHenry’s team will
have to be “ready for anything”
from Duke, which has had five

=| weeks of preparation to avenge last

year’s 9-3 defeat by the W&L stick-
men.
McHenry said last year’s Blue

‘| Devils lacked stickwork and over-

all team speed. His team is in good
physical condition and has had a
week to rest since the last game,
against Hofstra.

Netters Win
Six on Trip

After losing its first two matches,
the varsity tennis team took six
straight on a spring trip in North
Carolina and Virginia.

A Wednesday match with Hamp-
den-Sydney was postponed because
of rain. The netters return to action
a week from today against Lynch-
burg College.

Number two man John Baker had
been unable to make the trip and
number one man and captain Jim
DeYoung suffered an injury that
kept him out of most of the matches.

 

W&L won that game, played in

Trackmen Beat Tigers;
Kell Boys Take Four Firsts

By JOHNNY GRAHAM

The Washington and Lee track team, defeated in its initial
meet, collected its first victory yesterday with a 89-47 win over
Hampden-Sydney at Death Valley.

Winning 12 of the 16 events, and sweeping the 440 and

880 yard runs, the Generals piled up a commanding lead in the
field events, and were never serious-*

ly challenged.

There were two double winners.
Chris Kell captured both dashes
and brother Robin took the triple
jump and high jump.

Relays Tomorrow

A 30-man squad left Lexington
today for the annual Colonial Re-
lay meet in Williamsburg tomorrow.

Coach Norm Lord has entered
competitors in the seven field events
and five individual running events
as well as the seven relay events.

Top individual entrants are Chris
Kell in the invitational 100-yard
dash and Charlie Head in the 300-
meter steeplechase.

.

Baltimore, 8-4, The Generals showed
a marked improvement, particularly
in the second half, in their ability
to clear and pick up ground balls.

Randy Wootton (three goals) and
Mike Michaeles (2 goals) led the
scoring. Johnny McDaniel picked
up 12 ground balls, roughly com-
parable to grabbing 25 rebounds in
basketball.

McHenry sees his main concern
as keeping up the momentum.

- DU gained a berth in the volley-

 

 

ball finals Wednesday night when
they downed PEP 2-0 on games
of 14-4 and 8-3. DU had finished
their league in a three-way tie for
first with PEP and Beta. PEP had
upended Beta earlier, 2-1.

Generals dropped a close 80-65 de-
cision to the Monarchs of Old Do-
minion College.

Although W&L won eight of 17
events, defeats in both relays and
Old Dominion sweeps in three other
events spelled the difference.

Playoff action also got underway
Wednesday night. In the only
game played that night, ZBT de-
feated Phi Kappa Sig. Activity
continued last night with four
games being played. The tourna-
ment will end Monday night.

The I-M Softball season gets un-
derway next week, with the first
games Monday afternoon. Delt is
defending champion.

Freshman shot-putter Gay Gasque
broke the school record in winning
the event with a heave of 46’ 4”. This
betters the mark of 45’ 8” set by
A. B. Platt in 1957.

The Kell brothers led the way,
scoring 18 points between them.
Chris took both sprints, winning the
100 in 10.2, and the 220 in 228.
Robin won the triple jump with a
42’ 9” effort, and took second place
in the high jump.

by Tim OKeefe

The battleship Texas, used as a
target ship by the Army and sunk
in the Chesapeake Bay, has almost

yielded one of its treasurers to
skindivers.

For several years we have been
chartering boats to dive on the

ship, trying to salvage the bronze
propeller from the battlewagon.

We would have succeeded if a
knot hadn’t slipped and if visi-

ibility under water had _ been
better.
Rex Jones, a navy diver, and I

had often planned how we would
raise the propeller. As we swam
slowly over the wreck, searching
for cleats for portholes, we kept a
constant lookout for the propeller.

Since the wreckage had been al-
most leveled to the 30-foot bottom
by an Army demolition crew three
years ago, our chances of finding
any object still in good shape were
slim.

Rex placed his hand on a pro-
truding piece of metal and slowly
swayed back and forth in the
gentle current as he watched me
dig into a pile of rubble.

WHO
SAID

   

Of course, it’s for them, toc.

Foreign
Study is for
Language Majors

  
    
 

Only.

But it’s also for undergrads in history, political science,
international relations, economics, psychology, philosophy

and some other fields.

We know. Over half the students in our university centers
in Europe aren't language majors. They're pursuing studies
in their own fields, and giving them a fresh, European di-
mension—without interrupting their college careers.

Foreign study may suit you, too. (It isn’t for everyone.)
This is the time of life when the experience of Europe can
mean most. It will mean most if you use it to deepen and

extend your formal studies.

You might look into it-and learn about our programs, in-
cluding a new one opening next fall at the University of

Madrid.

Our centers don’t offer mere “‘civilization” courses. They
aren't cozy little ‘‘ghettos’’ for Americans. Institute pro-
grams immerse you in a great European university as deeply
as your abilities allow. (We supplement and guide your
studies, as necessary, to make sure they satisfy U. S.

requirements.)

of Freiburg, in the Black Forest; taught in German, with tutorials.
For B-average juniors with intermediate German. Das Deutsche

PARIS e@ French-taught Honors Program in Contemporary

Raising Battleship’s Propeller

(Continued from page 3)

Suddenly he let out a muffled roar
and grabbed my shoulder. He pointed
to the object he had been resting
on. It looked like any other rusty,
sponge-covered ship part. Then I
realized what I was seeing—it was
our much sought-after propeller,
almost unrecognizable in its coating
of grime and marine growth.

The propeller was still on the
shaft. Rex and I tugged and
found to our surprise that the
shaft was loose. After tying a rope
to it, we surfaced.

Two other divers joined us in the
water. I removed the nut holding

adequate medical facilities available
elsewhere. If your proposals have
merit, I’m sure that out of 50 states
you can find one willing to try
them.

Meanwhile, I still suggest that you
content yourself with an effort to
improve our free system rather
than institutionalize a “concept”
(quoting your British authority who
obviously was aware of the differ-
ence between theory and practice)
of socialized “utopia” which in prac-
tice has demonstrated its inferiority

propellor to shaft. then we tied an-
other rope and a chain around the
propeller and went back to the
boat. We hoped to use it to pull
off the propeller and raise it.

As the boat strained against the
propeller, we felt something snap
loose. We hauled in the rope and
chain but there was no propeller
tied to its end. A quick underwater
survey showed the propeller had
come off the shaft, but the knot had
slipped and our rope and chain had
come loose.

The propeller had been pulled
some distance from the shaft. Be-
cause it was getting late and the
visibility had dropped to about three
feet, we called off our search until
another time.

Anyone needing skindiving or
SCUBA gear, get in touch with me.
