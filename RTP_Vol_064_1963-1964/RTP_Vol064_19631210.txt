Hymns, Readings To Be Highlight
Of Christmas Candlelight Service

By Howard Epstein

With plans already in the final
stages, the University Christian As-
sociation announced yesterday the
format of their annual University
Christmas Candlelight Service.

The service, patterned after those
produced yearly by the Kings Col-
lege in England and broadcast over
B.B.C., will be held in the Robert
E. Lee Memorial Church at 10 p.m.
Thursday, December 19.

This year’s program is similar to
that of previous years. The cere-
monies will open with carols by the
John A. Graham Brass Choir led by
Prof. Robert Stewart, followed by
the processional hymn, “Adeste Fe-
deles,” and the invocation by Dr.
David Sprunt. Then in an alternat-
ing fashion, nine lessons will be
read interspaced between carols led
by the Glee Club.

Each of the lessons will be read by

a different person: Frank J. Gilliam,
Dean Emeritus; Dr. James G. Ley-
burn; Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy; Dr.
Louis W. Hodges; Prof. John K. Jen-
nings; Dr. Cecil D. Jones; Dr. James
K. Shillington; Dr. George F. Drake;
and Bill Noell, President of the Stu-
dent Body.

Between the sixth and seventh
lessons, the U.C.A. will present its
annual offering to the Rockbridge
County Welfare Department. Fol-
lowing the lessons, Dr. Sprunt will
deliver the benediction. The cere-
monies will then conclude with the
recessional, “Joy to the World,” and
a fanfare by the Brass Choir.

It is also pointed out by Robin
Kell, chairman of the Worship Com-
mittee, that the services were not
held in Lee Chapel this year due
to fire regulations. However, he ex-
pressed hope that in future years the

Topic Unannounced

Student Leaders 'To Discuss
Conventional Dress Problem

 

|

 

The topic of Grenier’s speech has not yet been
announced, but it will probably deal with the profes-
sional party men who are in the background of every
election. This is the role that Grenier has assumed in
the Republican Party. The speech will be non-partisan
and is being set up as a part of the pre-convention
activities symposium to inform W&L students of the
structure of the Republican Party.

As one of the original members in the draft-Gold-
water movement, Grenier is one of the top leaders in
the Goldwater campaign.

Reception After Speech

After his speech Mr. Grenier will attend a recep-
tion at the Kappa Sigma House. Anyone interested in
talking to Mr. Grenier is urged to attend this recep-
tion where partisan subjects may be discussed.

Blaine Brownell, chairman of the Alabama dele-
gation for the Mock Convention, has announced that

Spring as a guest of the Alabama Delegation.

the Glee Club, the UCA, SWMSFC,

Since the last dinner of this na-
ture, held on October 9, a steering
committee has been debating the
future role of the Forum. A four-
man sub-committee was chosen to
draft a constitution, which it did.
This first effort was voted down by
the committee as a whole, and re-
vised constitution will be submitted
to the entire Forum for its approval
tonight.

As the constitution now stands,
the Forum would have the right of
making resolutions—in effect recom-
mendations—vis-a-vis problems on
campus. It would have no actual
power insofar as the passage of real
legislation is concerned.

Historian Praises Virtues
Of the Ante-bellum South

By MIKE HASH

Dr. Clement Eaton, professor of
history at the University of Ken-
tucky spoke last evening in Lee
Chapel under the sponsorship of the
Washington and Lee History De-
partment. His topic was, “Voice of
Emotion—William L. Yancy of Ala-
bama.”

A graduate of the University of |

North Carolina, Dr. Eaton received
his Ph. D. Degree from Harvard
University. He was a Guggenheim
Fellow in 1945-46, and was elected
Distinguished Professor of the Year
at Kentucky in 1956. He also served
as president of the Southern His-
torical Association.

Dr. Eaton began his lecture de-
scribing the South in terms of its
virtures rather than its faults. The
Old South, according to Dr. Eaton,

Debate Breaks
Even At NYU

Debating at the New York Uni-
versity debate tournament in New
York City this past weekend, the
Washington and Lee debate team

| compiled a five and five record, dis-

playing major wins over Yale and
Columbia, as well as host NYU. They
defeated also City College of New
York and Carnegie Institute of
Technology.

University of Maine was the sharp-
est thorn as they defeated both W&L
affirmative and negative teams. Cor-
nell, Fordham, and Connecticut
Southern served the other defeats.

Debating the affirmative with a
final 3-2 posting were John Mc-
Murry and Sam Frazier, while a
with reversed 2-3 record, for the
negative, were Bill Grant and Bill
Cannon.

Of the 29 schools entered, debate
coach Chaffin estimates that Wash-
ington and Lee finished somewhere
near the middle, but could not be
definite the tournament calcu-
lated only the first few places, the
first being won by Georgetown Uni-
versity of Washington, D.C.

Mike Hayslip and Ed Fitzgerald,
who had earlier this year compiled
a 2-3 record at Duquesne Invita-
tional tournament in Pittsburgh, will
debate both affirmative and nega-
tive positions at the Wake Forest
tournament at Winston-Salem this
weekend.

The national topic for the year is,
“Resolved: that the Federal Govern-
ment should guarantee to every high
school graduate the opportunity for
higher education,”

as

 

“cultivated the art of being a gentle-
man.” The emphasis of southern gen-
tility was on versatility and good
manners. Dr. Eaton further pointed
out the deep appreciation of the
value of the family, and the sense of
chivalry which was so much a part
of southern virtue.

Balanced Government

“The concept of a balanced gov-
ernment,” Dr. Eaton continued,
“was the basis of southern political
feeling.” He underscored the value
of vitality in local government as
the source of the strongest patrio-
tism . In addition to these Dr. Eaton
cites the “cherished martial virtues”
and the high sense of honor as re-
flecting the true southern environ-
ment. “The essence of the Old
South” was summarized by Dr.
Eaton as “an unusual sense of his-
tory—almost the burden of history.”

In excerpts from his soon-to-be-
published book From the Mind of
the Old South, Dr. Eaton spoke on
the life of William L. Yancy of Ala-
bama, the orator of secession. Dr.
Eaton described Yancey as the “ster-
eotype of a southern gentleman,”
and yet a high spirited and impet-
uous man. It was unfortunate, ac-
cording to Dr. Eaton, that Yancey
came to the forefront at a time when
he was able to sway the southern
moderate to secession by his power
of oratory.

Discusses His Novel

Yancey’s role in politics, both na-
tional and local, was discussed at
length by Dr. Eaton. From his law
practice in Alabama to his eventual
rise to Congress, Dr. Eaton sees in
Yancey the elements of radical po-
litical zeal. His “sectional bent” and
his support of the so called “Ala-
bama Platform” dealing with the
Texas question illustrate in Dr.
Eaton’s words, “Yancey’s obsession
with southern rights.”

Dr. Eaton pointed to the tremen-
dous appeal of Yancey’s oratory in
the southern environment. Yancey
used the technique of the “camp
meeting,” according to Dr. Eaton,
he followed the tradition of great

orators by “speaking the truth as
truth.”
Dr. Eaton concluded his lecture

by turning to the origins of the col-
lapse of the Union. He attributed it
primarily to the fear of most South-
erners of an uncertain future. The
southerner realized the frantic de-
termination of the North to change
his way of life, and in the opinion of

Dr. Eaton yielded to the voice of his |

own radical element. Thus in the
1950’s “the voice of emotion had pre-
vailed in the South,”

FD Costumes
Offer Variety
Of Disguises

By MIKE HASH
Assistant News Editor

Steve Hibbard, vice-president of
the Dance Board, announced today
that costumes for the Fancy Dress
Ball are on sale. They were sold
from the Student Union this after-
noon beginning at 2; sales closed at
3 p.m.

Mardi Gras

A large variety of costumes are
available for the February weekend.
As the theme for the Fancy Dress
Ball will be “Mardi Gras,” the pos-
sibilities are unlimited. Available are
animal suits, pirate outfits, Old South
costumes, Greek and Roman citizens
and soldiers, Spanish motifs, clowns,
Indians, Roaring Twenties, Dutch,
and full dress.

The unusually extensive inven-
tory is due in part to the recent
purchases by the Oak Hill Rental
Service in Roanoke of the Triple
A Costume Shop in Atlanta. This
move has made Oak Hill the largest
costume distributor in the South,
and it is particularly well-stocked
with costumes for a “Mardi Gras”
theme.

Prices Low

Costumes for the girls may also be
obtained. Students may make their
own costumes, in fact, as long as
they are “within reason.” The price
is down again this year—$8.00. They
go on sale again tomorrow: 9:30 to
1:00 and 2 to 5. Costumes should be
ordered early despite the wide var-
iety, because size may still be a
problem.

W&L Given
Old Papers

A special exhibit of newspapers
relating to the assassinations of
President Lincoln and Garfield are
on exhibition in the display case in
the library of the Department of
Journalism and Communications in
Payne Hall.

The newspapers are a gift of Earle
Palmer Brown, 44, of Washington,
D.C., to the archives of the Depart-
ment. One is a copy of the New York
Herald for Wednesday, April 26,
1865, describing funeral ceremonies
for Abraham Lincoln in New York
City.

The other is a copy of the Brook-
lyn Daily Eagle for Tuesday, Sept.
20, 1881, and gives an account of the
death of James A. Garfield at the
Elberon Hotel in Long Branch, N. J.,
with accounts of reactions in the
nation and abroad.

 

Albright to Manage
Evans Dining Hall

William G. Albright has assumed
his new duties as manager of the
Slater Food Service at Evans Dining
Hall.

Mr. Albright succeeds Merle
Campbell Bartley who has held the
position since the dining hall was
opened in 1958. Mr. Bartley now
manages one of the Slater-served
cafeterias at North Carolina State.

Although a native of Georgia, Mr.
Albright calls Florida his home. He
graduated from the St. Petersburg
high school and is a graduate of
Florida State University, majoring in
restaurant and hotel management.
While doing graduate work at Flor-
ida State, he was a partner in a
restaurant business in Tallahassee.

Following this, Mr. Albright serv-

ed as director of food service at
the Bainbridge Air Base in Georgia
and later with the Dobbs House

chain, serving as manager of a coffee
shop at the Atlanta Municipal Air-
port and manager of an _ airport
restaurant in Birmingham, Ala.
| Other Caferteria management work
| has been at Tennessee State College
and the University of Alabama.

Mr. Albright is married and has
| two sons, aged eight and eleven. He
| plans to move his family to Lexing-
| ton during the Christmas holidays.

EC’s Hold On The Press—
Should It Be Tolerated?

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT FIRES EDITOR OF
NEW YORK HERALD.TRIBUNE

Preposterous? Yes. But here on our quiet little campus,
the Executive Committee of the Student Body can fire
either or both of the editors of The Ring-tum Phi. If any-
thing in our constitution should be omitted or changed, it
is Article V, Section G: “It (the Executive Committee)
shall have jurisdiction of the Publications Board and
Dance Board, and may after notice and hearing, and upon
two-thirds vote of the entire Committee at two succes-
sive meetings, reverse any order of either Board.”

Governmental control of the press is certainly a flaw
in any system which purports to be democratic—so why
hasn’t the point been brought to the attention of the stu-
dent body previously? A glance at the gallery of Ring-tum
Phi Editors over the past years provides the answer: last
year, one editor was also an EC member; the year before,
one editor was also an EC member; the year before that,
one editor was also an EC member; and the year before
that, (1959-60), neither editor was a member of the rul-
ing class. A stupid oversight. But the year before that—
1958-59—one editor was on the EC, and the other was his
fraternity brother.

EC Should Be Most Criticized

Is it strange, therefore, that the history of W&L re-
veals very little criticism of the EC? Yet, of all the organ-
izations at W&L, the Executive Committee should be the
most criticized. Considering its power, it should be open
to inspection by any interested student. ‘“‘Why isn’t it?”
Asks E. Martin Flurb, Class of ’65. Well—whenever the
EC makes a small—or large “boo boo,” it tells—oops—
advises the Ring-tum Phi not to say anything about it.

Added to this is the fact that members of the student
press don’t get a chance to know about very many mis-
takes which the EC makes, because that committee won’t
let members of the newspaper staffs into their meetings
when anything of real consequence is being discussed.
We hasten to point out that several members of the EC
would like full press coverage of all meetings, and thus the
entire committee should not be blamed for the ostrich
complex which a few of its members seem to have.

 

More Coverage Needed

We've been rather flippant in telling this sad tale and
our mood has been purposeful. We happen to think that
the student body has a right to know what the EC is
doing—all the time; what it is thinking about matters
which concern us. How it is going about solving our prob-
lems—or if it is even considering the problems about
which we are most concerned. All we want to do is publish
what the EC is doing each week—every student has a right
to know—and then at least we’ll have had a chance to
form an opinion about our student leadership, or decide
that we don’t really care.

President Bill Noell has said, before many witnesses,
that he believes student government should be a mutual
thing, not something determined by a small minority of
the student body. Yet we have reason to believe that a
small minority of that small minority called the EC is run-
ing our student government. We would like to see a Stu-
dent Senate with a veto power over the EC; we believe the
present constitution needs revision in several places; we
believe that Bill Noell should show that he believes what
he said about mutual government.

Or are we fired?

Open Criticism A Must

A very perceptive student who has been at W&L for
a long time said that he hates to see the Executive Com-
mittee criticized. His reason is a good one: this commit-
tee is vested with the responsibility of deciding the guilt or
innocence of fellow students charged with an honor vio-
lation. The task they have is an awesome one—it is no
fun to have to tell a student he must leave Washington and
Lee, with no chance for parole.

It follows, then, that criticism directed at the EC takes
something away from the respect which they must have in
order to carry out their job successfully. It is in this very
point, however, that the great weakness of our present
system shows itself. The EC is responsible not only for
judicial decisions, but for executive and legislative matters
as well. And certainly these latter two departments should
be subject to criticism. That is what we have chosen to do
in the above editorial.

It is our firm belief that the students responsible for
decision in honor cases should be charged with that par-
ticular task, and no other. But since that is not the case,
we have no choice but to criticize a committee which we
feel has too much to do. The integrity of the members of
this year’s EC is beyond question as far as we’re con-
cerned—it is the approach which some of its members
have been taking on several debatable issues that we do

question.

John Updike, Rabbit, Run. (Crest

Reviewed by BERT PHILLIPS

Looking at Rabbit, Run after hav-
ing been away from it for some time,
I first recalled the image of a rath-
er stupid, washed-out basketball
player in bed with an ugly, pudgy
whore. In another image, I could
see the same man in a second-hand
car, zooming into the winter night,
listening to every rock ’n roll song
popular in 1960; more interested in
Connie Francis, Duane Eddy, and
“Stagger Lee” than his pregnant
wife and young son whom he had
deserted.

Too Much Ado

I also recollected a friend’s remark
that the individuals involved in the
lengthy sex scenes in Rabbit, Run
seemed to feel only animal pleasures,
and that there was no spiritual in-
volvement whatsoever. I finally re-
called a remark Updike made about
Salinger’s Franny and Zooey: “It is
just too much verbal ado about not
quite enough.” My reaction was that
people who live in glass houses
shouldn’t throw stones.

John Updike has bared the mind,
heart and soul of a disjointed sim-
pleton—Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom.
Rabbit’s one claim to fame was his
high school basketball career at a
small town Pennsylvania high school.

lofty position as a door-to-door
salesman of a useless kitchen gad-
get). Rabbit also is obsessed by sex-
ual intercorse.

For a time, Rabbit’s wife, Janice,
is equal to his obsession. She was his
high school sweetheart; after their
marriage she began to drink heavily
and to watch the “Mickey Mouse
Club.” There is one child in the
marriage, with another on the way.
One day Rabbit becomes unbear-
ably repulsed by and bored with his
situation as father, lover, and Mag-
ipeel salesman, so he takes off. He
turns first to his old coach, Tothero
(a stab by Updike at the “dear
coach” image) through whom Rab-
bit meets Ruth, an _ unattractive,
lardy lady, who slowly but surely
becomes a prostitute.

The first night Rabbit pays; but
from then on, he and Ruth just live
together. She pretends to be nothing
she is not, realizing that Rabbit is
no great prize, but that neither is
she .Everything is fine until a young,
ineffectual Episcopal minister ap-
pears and convinces Rabbit that his
desertion is morally wrong.

Tragedy Strikes

When Rabbit returns to his wife,
just as she is having their second
child, tragedy is just around the
corner. After the event, Rabbit
leaves home for good, attempts in
vain to go back to Ruth, whom he
discovers is pregnant and consider-
ing abortion; Ruth, contemptuous of

the confused Rabbit, will have noth-
ing to do with him.

The whole tissue of Rabbit's life
offers him nothing, and he offers
nothing in return. Painfully accept-
ing this, he performs one of the few
creditable acts of his life; he becomes
true to himself and takes off for
good. He runs, and Updike seems to
say he will run forever.

No Likable Characters

In trying to evaluate the book,
perhaps the first impression that one
gets is that Updike has written a
novel which does not contain a
single “likable” person. Our distaste
for the characters can be explained
by the fact that they are all too
weak, too “average,” and especially
in Rabbit and Janice’s case, too
stupid. Updike’s description of the
final tragedy which compels Rabbit
to leave home for good is almost un-
bearable. One can feel the author’s
intense hate of human stupidity in
the reading of this passage.

At times Updike seems to write at
his characters, challenging them to
face their situations and do someth-
ing about it. The trouble is, and Up-
dike is in fact telling us, that there
are no answers for Rabbit and the
others, that their problems are
brought to them by the state of
America today. Rabbit may run, but
where? Although Updike never
comes out and declares that these
people are representative of Mr. and

Liberal Supports Kennedy ‘Rights’ Bill,
Defends Public Accomodations Section

By LAMAR LAMB

This article is an attempt to show the liberal point of
view on the currently debated Civil Rights Bill.

One of the primary criticisms leveled at the bill from
certain camps is that the monstrous federal government,
in an attempt to insure equal rights for all citizens, might
be overstepping its legal bounds. Voting rights, it is
pointed out, are specifically an area of state power as
is stated in Article I of the Constitution.

This is true enough, but if one reads further in the
Constitution to the 14th Amendment, it will be dis-
covered that this amendment provides that no state
shall deny to any person the equal protection of laws.
In the light of their argument, those who make the
“voting rights” criticism of the Civil Rights Bill no doubt
oppose that amendment to the Constitution which allows
women to vote.

In an area where states were obviously, even openly
discriminating against certain groups of their citizens,
the federal government has had to move in to protect
individual rights—surely something conservatives should
favor. I agree, it is regrettable that such action is neces-
sary, but that it is necessary there can be no doubt.
And, that the federal government has the legal right to
to do so, there can also be no doubt.

In regards to the Public Accommodations section of
the Civil Rights Bill, grave doubts as to the legality of
the proposed legislation are often expressed. In questions
of constitutionality such as these, one must look to just
what the Supreme Court would decide were a case
brought to them. There can be little doubt that were
the Supreme Court to hear such a case, it would rule
Congress completely within its power in passing this
legislation.

Interestingly enough, however, opponents of the bill
make no mention of the Supreme Court or any previous
decisions, they instead content themselves with what
they consider specific loopholes in the Administration’s
justification for the law. Their criticism can, I think, be
refuted were there sufficient time, space, and patience,
but that is really not needed. Congress would obviously
be completely within its rights to pass such a bill be-
cause of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution which

authorizes Congress to regulate commerce among the
several states.

There can can be little doubt that the public ac-
commodations section of the bill applies only to those
businesses which actively engage in inter-state com-
merce in that they buy and sell across state lines, and
openly encourage business with inter-state travelers.

But according to the old maximum, great issues are
seldom discussed in the light of the real principles in-
volved. This must certainly be true of the civil rights
legislation of this and previous years. Opposers to the
bill state that they do not defend racial discrimination,
merely individual liberty, i.e., the right to discriminate.

Of course, in light of the present situation they are in
fact defending racial discrimination whether they want
to admit it or not. This right to discriminate is based
on title property, something they evidently consider
the ultimate value in our society. If title property were
the only principle with which our government concerned
itself, then they might be justified in their argument.

But, fortunately, that is not the only prinicple in-
volved, else the right of eminent domain would also be
unconstitutional. Another principle our government con-
cerns itself with is that all men are created equal and as
such cannot legally be discriminated against.

It is interesting to speculate just which individual’s
liberty conservatives concern themselves with. It is ob-
viously the bigoted property owners. Naturally it is true
that anyone has a legal right to hold just about any
conceivable bias he wants, but right to act on that bias
stops when it interferes with another man’s freedom.

This is, I submit, the real issue at stake: it is not
some desperate clinging to the straws of justification for
hate, a justification of ends by means, but rather whether
a person can allow his prejudice to restrict his neighbor’s
freedom.

Let those people who are concerned with individual
liberty consider whether a citizen of this country should,
among other things, have an equal opportunity to vote,
or have the liberty to eat and sleep on an extended trip.
When they do that, they will favor the passing of the
Civil Rights Bill.

‘Specialization’
Limits Students

By GARETH ADEN

Last week a statement was made
in one of my classes which startled
me. It concerns something which
should be worthy the consideration
of any college student.

It was remarked that there was
little common ground any more be-
tween the man of the humanties and
the man of science. I feel, especially
after a year and a half here, that
there is a good deal of truth in
this statement. Furthermore I feel
this lack of common ground be-
tween the arts and the sciences is
due more to a fallacy in current edu-
cational theory than anything else.

Too Much Specialization

It appears that the idea of special-
ization in undergraduate school has
become overly stressed. No one lets
the student forget that he is living in
the Age of Science, more specifically,
the Age of Specialization. I would
not really deny the scientific age, nor
would I deny the need for special-
ized men in a complex world. What
I would question, though is the time
when a man should begin to special-
ize—the difference being the mere
margin between a “man” and a
“machine.”

Modern educational theory and
the “Race for Space” seem to have
panicked the college undergraduate
into the belief that if he doesn’t
learn everyaring about his chosen
field as a nundergraduate, he will be
left at the gate by the man who has
specialized. This is ridiculous.

Stress on Graduate Work

Fifteen years ago this concept
might have been a little nearer the
truth than it is today. Then fewer
people went to graduate school and
thus they had to rely more on their
undergraduate education for a job.
Today no one who is going into a
truly specialized field can do with-
out graduate school; therefore, what
today’s students are doing by nar-
rowing their field of interest before
graduation is simply the act of de-
priving themselves of a true educa-
tion,

No successful doctor, lawyer, or
scientist will stand by the idea of
complete specialization in college.
Most of these professional men will,
on the contrary, urge as much diver-
sification in undergraduate work as
graduate school requirements will
allow. The reason for this is quite
simple: these men understand the
value of a liberal education which
makes for a broad mind instead of
a narrow one. They know that a
doctor who can carry on an intel-
ligent conversation about something
other than medicine or write a pre-
sentable letter will be more success-
ful than a court lawyer who knows
nothing about psychology.

Diversification Is Goal

Looking at the question from a
more theoretical point of view, what
good is education that limits the
capabilities of the mind? College
curricula have so much to offer
that it is a waste to see a student
obtain knowledge in only one sub-
ject. The tendency among students
has been more and more to use elec-
tives in the field of their specialty,
where they feel comfortably “most
at home.” Such action boils down
to irrationally building walls around
oneself. History has always seen the
well-rounded individual rise above
the others simply because he can
draw from many fields the knowl-
edge and skills to attack his specific
problem.

Undergraduate education should
therefore be basically a prepara-
tion for specialization and not spec-
ialization itself. A certain amount of
focus in one’s schedule is admittedly
good and necessary, but at the
present this “focus” is being over-
played. This is why the humanities
and the sciences are finding it in-
creasingly difficult to communicate
with one another. Their scope is no
longer broad enough to stretch into
fields other than their own,

System Needs Change

This inability of the man of sci-
ense to speak meaningfully to the
man of the humanities has already
made its claim as one of the most
pressing problems of our time. One
field needs to be tempered by the
other and is bound to become dan-
gerous or meaningless if inter-com-
munication is impossible. Education
can solve this problem by putting
undergraduate college education
back on its original footing of diver-
sification rather than specialization.

Four Returning Lettermen,

Top Cage Prospects, Up Hope

Throughout the winter season,
the Tuesday Sports Edition will
feature one General team a week
to try and show you what and
who to watch.

By BILL DAVID

Four returning three-year veter-
ans and a bumper crop of under-
classmen give Washington and Lee’s
basketball Generals a good chance
of recording their first winning sea-
son in recent campaigns this year.

W&L’s success, however, depends
on how well the Generals realize the
considerable potential they have ex-
hibited in past seasons. All four of
the veteran mainstays—guards Don

ingston, with freshman Jeff Twardy
also in the running for the position.

Three of the veterans are seniors.
Wallis, a 5-9 guard, has been the
leading playmaker for the Generals
in practice scrimmages and should
bolster the offensive attack with his
long jump shots and driving lay-ups.
A native of Indiana, he transferred
to W&L as a sophomore and has
been a regular since. Forward Su-
pack, 6-2, also a transfer, is consid-
ered one of the best drivers in area
small college basketball. He also
commands an accurate jump shot
and can play both forward and guard
positions. Martin, the team’s third
senior, is at 6-5 its leading rebound-

 

Tarheels, 16-14.

In the first match for both teams, the University of North

Carolina took an early lead and
9-1 in the 157-pound class last year,*
pinned the visitor’s Bill Woodall
midway through the final period to
give the Generals a 13-8 lead.
Jansen then decisioned UNC’s
Elliott Dorwin, 5-2, in the 167-pound
contest to give the Minks a com-
manding 16-8 advantage with only
two matches remaining. General
captain, Herb Smith, then lost a
hard-fought match in the 177 class,
8-5, to make the overall score 16-11.
Smith seemed to tire in the third
and final period of his match as he
battled a much heavier opponent.
Musick was very impressive in his
first match at W&L as he pinned his

 

held it until Winfield, who was

 

foe in 2:40 of the first period. This
put the Generals ahead, 5-3, after
freshman Bruce Builder lost the
initial contest of the evening to
Tarheel Paul Wellston, 5-0.

Washington and Lee’s Don Pat-
terson, in the 137-pound division,
was pinned by North Carolina grap-
pler, Russel Simmons, with slightly
more than a minute remaining in
the match. Stover then out-pointed
Roy Hagerty of UNC, 5-3, in an ac-
tion-packed 147-pound match.

With the score 16-11 and the
Generals sure of no worse than a

ODC Beats Cagers, 86-63
Spessard and Wallis Lead;
Initial Home Tilt Tonight

The W&L basketball team started
its season on a sour note as it suc-
cumed to Old Dominion Saturday on
the winner’s home court, 86-63. The
Monarchs piled up an early lead and
then sent in the reserves as they
coasted to victory.

Tonight the Generals are host to
Bridgewater at 8:00 for their first
home contest of the season. Bridge-
water has its best team in several
seasons as demonstrated by its con-
vincing win of Randolph-Macon last
week. Macon had the best team in
the state last year and has most of its
men returning this year.

The Generals got into foul
troubles early in the first half of
their losing cause with the Monarchs
shooting “one and one” on the free-
throw line with only five minutes
gone in the game. ODC took advant-
age of this break by hitting on 22 of
29 charity tosses, while the Minks
could only sink 21 of 35 foul shots.

The high scorers for the winners
were Randy Leddy with 16, Wayne
Parks with 14, Ronnie Byrd with 12
and Jerry Nichols with 10. The
Blue and White were paced by Bob
Spessard with 12 and Don Wallis
with 10 points. The Generals made
21 of 58 shots from the floor for a
poor average of 36 per cent.

 

picking David and Crenshaw.

David is well-known for his pass
receiving and alert pass defense and
was so impressive this season that
McLaughlin has hinted at opening
up the General offense next year to
take full advantage of this halfback’s
amazing hands.

The 5-10, 180-pounder KA, a na-
tive of Harwinton, Connecticut led
the College Athletic Conference in
pass reception with 20 grabs good
for 222 yards and 4 TDs. David also
led the team and was among the
conference leaders with 5 intercep-
tions for 30 yards and was a feared
punt return specialist.

Chenshaw, who depends more on
his ferocious running and fine back-
field blocking, is a 5-8, 178-pound
Delt from Henderson, N. Y. He saw
only limited action this season, but
was very impressive when operating
at full capacity. McLaughlin stated
that “even though injuries kept
Crenshaw sidelined much of the
year, the boys recognized his leader-
ship ability.”

It was also felt that Crenshaw’s
hard running would give the Gen-
erals another steady ground game
from the halfback position that
Yoffe vacated, the new co-captain’s
rushing average of 4.7 yards-per-
carry this season supports this pre-
diction.

Tom Supak and center Howard Mar-
tin—were frequent double-figure
scorers last season but seemed un-
able to group their efforts consistent-
ly and as a result Washington and
Lee finished with a disappointing 6-
13 record.

Coach Bob McHenry is expected
to rely on this quartet as a nucleus
of the Generals’ starting team. The
fifth starter is likely to be Fred
Mindel, Steve Sweitzer or Dick Liv-

and Martin hail from the Norfolk-

Junior Lou Paterno broke into the
Washington and Lee line up as a
freshman. He is probably the stead-

lies heavily on a deadly jumper for
his points. Paterno is a shade under

*TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY

If you have been reading this column—and I hope you have; I
mean I genuinely hope so; I mean it does not profit me one
penny whether you read this column or not; I mean I am paid
every week by the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes and my
emolument is not affected in any way by the number of people
who read or fail to read this column—an act of generosity
perfectly characteristic of the makers of Marlboro, you would
say if you knew them as I do; I mean here are tobacconists gray
at the temples and full of honors who approach their art as
eagerly, as dewy-eyed as the youngest of practitioners; I mean
the purpose of the Marlboro makers is simply to put the best of
all possible filters behind the best of all possible tobaccos and
then go, heads high, into the market place with their wares,
confident that the inborn sense of right and wrong, of good and
bad, of worthy and unworthy, which is the natural instinct of
every American, will result in a modest return to themselves
for their long hours and dedicated labors—not, let me hasten to
add, that money is of first importance to the makers of Marlboro;
all these simple men require is plain, wholesome food, plenty of
Marlboros, and the knowledge that they have scattered a bit of
sunshine into the lives of smokers everywhere; if, I say, you
have been reading this column, you may remember that last
week we started to discuss Christmas gifts.

1o Wo Wow Someone whe t3itheresfed te Americar History?

We agreed, of course, to give cartons of Marlboro to all our
friends and also to as many total strangers as possible. Today
let us look into some other welcome gifts.

Do you know someone who is interested in American history?
If so, he will surely appreciate a statuette of Millard Fillmore
with a clock in the stomach. (Mr. Fillmore, incidentally, was
the only American president with a clock in the stomach.
James K. Polk had a stem-winder in his head, and William
Henry Harrison chimed the quarter-hour, but only Mr. Fillmore,
of all our chief executives, had a clock in the stomach. Franklin
Pierce had a sweep second hand and Zachary Taylor had
seventeen jewels, but, I repeat, Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Fillmore
alone had a clock in the stomach. Some say that Mr. Fillmore
was also the first president with power steering, but most
historians assign this distinction to Chester A. Arthur. How-

ever, it has been established beyond doubt that Mr. Fillmore
was the first president with a thermostat. Small wonder they
called him Old Hickory!)

But I digress. To get back to weleome and unusual Christmas
gifts, here’s one that’s sure to please—a gift certificate from the
Ameriean Chiropractic Society. Accompanying each certificate
is this winsome little poem:

Merry Christmas, Happy New Year,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Producer Is Praised For Movie

(Continued from page 2)

Weld are several of the most beau-
tiful scenes of this year.

Gleason wants something from
supplies, McQueen gives it to him.
McQueen is harassed and bullied
by the M.P.’s, so Gleason beats
hell out of them. They have only
one running disagreement. Mc-
Queen wants to get out of the
Army, and with Gleason, make a
million dollars. Gleason has found
a home in the army, and refuses
to leave. The manner in which this
problem is resolved results in a
beautiful and poignant scene.

William Goldman wrote the novel
and much credit must be given to
him. Nearly as much may be given
to Blake Edwards who adapted the
novel to the screen. Edwards has se-
lected his scenes carefully and de-
pended upon his talented actors to
bring out the full meaning of Gold-
man’s book. Ralph Nelson, the di-
rector, has seen to it that the actors
did accomplish what was expected of
them. He has cut what might have
been extraneous filler. He has pared
the film down so that each sequence
is essential to the whole.

Criticism of the film will be that
it is disjointed, that it lacks depth,
exposition, and motivation. When
first viewing it, the film will seem
disjointed; but it seems so in a re-
markable and pleasing way. And
later, in retrospect, the film be-
comes a carefully, tightly con-
structed film. Its seeming disjoint-
edness becomes actually well-con-
sidered and is one of the film’s
major virtues. As to its lacking
depth and exposition, that is simp-
ly up to the individual viewer.
Although the film is not a 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 progression, it is 1, 3, 5. Nel-
son allows one to fill in for
himself, he asks one to judge

wether what Nelson is show-

and rather than insist that he give
simple explanations for everything,
he asks one to accept what he pre-
sents and evaluate it as it is,

I believe he is justified in all this,
and I believe he has succeeded ad-
mirably. “Solder in the Rain” is the
finest American film I have seen this
year and gives one a little more

Updike’s Rabbit, Run Has

‘No Likable Characters’

Mrs. Average American, 1960, he
obviously intends that Rabbit’s story
is to be read as Everyman’s story.
Another complaint which many
have made about the novel is that
Updike goes beyond the line of
“good taste,” that Rabbit, Run, is
entirely too vulgar. One critic re-
marks that parts of the novel “out
Molly Bloome’s Molly Bloome.”
What can one say to this except to
reply that sex cannot be honestly
described as beautiful if it does
not seem beautiful to those involved.
But perhaps the ultimate weak-
ness of the book is Rabbit’s own.
There are few men, no matter how
desperate, who are as lacking of
inner resources. Rabbit, Run would
have been a bigger book if Rabbit
had been a bigger man.

The Washington and Lee junior

contest to North Carolina’s frosh
Saturday, 19-15, in a prelim to the
varsity match between these same
two schools.

It took until the final match, the
unlimited division, before the win-

shaw got trapped and pinned by
UNC’s Bill Johnson to give the
Baby Tarheels the victory.

The Generals came from behind
and with pins by Kemble White,
Jamie Andrew, and Jim Tyler, took
the lead 15-14, before the final

Crenshaw, the other General grap-
plers who lost hard-fought decisions
were Butch West, Graeme Banner-
