Al Eckes, University Party Chairman and, Tom Pace, Progressive Party
Chairman, prepare for April 16 elections.

EC Schedules April 16
Date For ’64 Elections

Student body elections will be
held on April 16 this year, the
Thursday before Spring Dances, ac-
cording to Student Body President
Bill Noell. The four student body
officers are President of the Student
Body, Vice-President, Secretary, and
Faney Dress President. These officers
will be elected by all four classes and
the law school.

Amendment Proposed

There is a complication in the
election of class officers. According
to the Student Body Constitution,
class elections must be held on
May 4. This year, however, the
Mock Convention is scheduled for
that date, and it is felt that Con-
vention activities would make it dif-
ficult for people to go to the Stu-
dent Union to vote.

The election date can be changed
only by an amendment to the Con-
stitution, and the Executive Com-
mittee plans to submit such an

Dorm Counselors

To BeA pointed

Applications are invited for the
position of Freshman Dormitory
Counselor for the 1964-65 academic
year.

Certain giudelines for the selec-
tion of Dormitory Counselors have
been set up on the basis of past ex-
perience. Applicants must be at least
current sophomores, and should not
have routine commitments after 8:00
p.m, that would normally take a
Counselor away from the dormitory
for any appreciable time.

While Counselorships are not
awarded on an academic basis, a stu-
dent who has failed to maintain a
C average would probably not be
selected.

The awards of Counselorship are
not based on financial need. How-
ever, in order to ensure the greatest
possible contact with freshmen,
Counselors are provided with a
single room in the dormitory and the
dinner meal in the Commons, which
they are expected to eat with the
freshmen.

The primary basis for selection
of Counselors will be that of gen-
eral fitness to aid in making the
Freshman Dormitory an adequate
environment for a student's fresh-
man year,

Students who are presently Dor-
mitory Counselors and who wish to
return next year should submit
letters to this effect to the Dean of
Students’ Office before Saturday,
April 18.

New applications should be filed
in person in the Office of the Dean
of Students by the same date,
April 18, and should include infor-
mation that will be helpful to the
selection Committee, Further de-
tails concerning duties and re-
sponsibilities, can be obtainted
from John Madison, Head Dormi-
tory Counselor, and Buck Ogilvie,
Jim Maffit, or Bob Henley, As-
sistant Head Dormitory Counsel-
ors, all members of the Selection
Committee.

 

amendment to the student body at
the time of the Ajpril 16 elections.
The proposed amendment would
provide for rescheduling of the class
elections in the event of some ser-
ious conflict.

In the class elections, the student
body will choose its Executive
Committee representatives and _ its
class officers. There are three law
school representatives, two senior
representatives, two from the junior
class, and one each from the sopho-
more and freshman classes. The
freshman representative will be
elected next fall by the class of
1968.

Class Officers

Each class has a president, vice-
president, secretary, and _ historian.
The senior class
presidents—for
arts, and science.

Nominations for the student body
and class offices are generally made
by the two parties, but write-in
candidates are legal. This year’s
nominees should be named _ shortly
by the University and Progressive
party cliques.

The Election will be held in the
student union from 8:25 am. to
5:00 p.m. on the scheduled election
dates. Voting will be held by sec-
ret ballot, and the Executive Com-
mittee is responsible for counting
votes.

Law Lectures

Set For April

John Ritchie, Dean of the North-
western University School of Law,
will be the principal speaker at the
16th annual Tucker Lectures here
next month.

The lectures will be given April 10
at 8 p.m. and April 11 at noon, in
Lee Chapel. Dean Ritchie will de-
liver both addresses.

He will speak on “Legal Educa-
tion in the United States.” Dean
Ritchie is current president of the
Association of American Law
Schools. His first address is entitled
“Yesterday”; his second, “Today
and Tomorrow.”

The dean holds law degrees from
the University of Virginia and Yale
University law schools.

Before accepting the deanship at
Northwestern, he served
ant dean at the University of Vir-
gilia law school, dean at Washington
University (St. Louis) and dean at

as assist-

the University of Wisconsin law
school.
“All members of the Washington

and Lee faculty and student body
are invited to attend both lectures,”
Dean Charles P. Light of the W&L
School of Law, said today.

“This is an excellent opportunity
for anyone considering a career in
legal education to hear about the
field,’ Dean Light said.

The weekend of the lectures will
actually serve a dual purpose for
the law school. The annual meeting
of the Washington and Lee Law
School Association will also be held
at that time.

Strict Quarantine Placed

On Students

And Faculty

Spring vacation has been canceled.

An official statement of the University has announced
that due to the “‘critical’’ state of the current German measles
epidemic, the entire faculty and student body will undergo

strict quarantine.

The quarintine will be imposed for a
*

statement read, thus “necessitating
cancellation of the spring vaca-
tion as scheduled.”

The statement was issued this af-
ternoon following an emergency
meeting of the administration and
and faculty. The meeting had been
prompted by a warning of the Uni-
versity medical office that the epi-
demic had reached such acute pro-
portions that a quarantine was
deemed advisable.

Classes will not be held next week,
but will reswme Monday, April 6.
Students are advised to stay in
close quarters. The medical office
has reported the infirmary to be
filled to capacity.

The epidemic first began late last
week when a number of students
simultaneously reported to the in-
firmary with severe sore throats.

“The sudden changes in climate,
added to the seasonal work of mid-
semester tests and papers, helped
account for the epidemic,” the in-
firmary reported.

For the student body, most of
whom had been planning to go
South during the week’s holiday, the
announcement is having an elec-
terifying effect. The ABC store and
several taverns have been forced to
close down due to the mobbing
students. The Lexington police force
has been placed on a full alert. A
ten o’clock curfew has been set by
the town mayor.

 

Giltlaw's Health
Reported Better

Dean Frank Gilliam, stricken with
a heart attack in Cincinnati, con-
tinues to improve, according to
members of the administration who
are in contact with him.

All indications from Holmes Hos-
pital, where Dean Gilliam is recup-
erating, are that his condition is
relatively good, and that he will
eventually make as full a recovery
as possible. The past Dean of Admis-
sions and Dean of Students has
already dictated several letters to
Lexington. Dean Gilliam’s son, who
was called to Cincinnati immediately
after the heart attack, has returned
home.

The attack came on March 13 as
Dean Gilliam and his wife toured
the midwest visiting alumni, pros-
pective students, and friends.

 

ten-day period, the

 

Student reaction is varied.

“As long as the Paramount and
the Liquid stay open,” one student
commented, “we'll survive.”

Another was less assured. “We'll
go batty,” he remarked. “Why
couldn’t they have extended the
quarantine to Sem?!”

The mayor, who is familiar with
W&L students from past incidents,
issued a plea for sanity, moderation,
and the continuation of good will be-
tween students and townspeople.

“Tell the students,’ he said, “to
remain calm in the face of this ad-
versity.”

When asked their opinion, the
Friday staff of the Ring-tum Phi
had this to say: “It will be curious
to see how many students will read
this article and won’t realize that it’s
all just a silly joke on our part
For those who don’t, we’re sorry.
There are inevitably one or two in
the crowd who can never spot an
April Fool’s stunt when they see
one. Ha!”

Cahoon Selected
For PBK Award

Edward Ray Cahoon, Jr., of
Chesapeake, Virginia, has been
awarded the Phi Beta Kappa
Sophomore Award for 1964.

Cahoon, a PiKA sophomore, is a
member of the Student Service So-
ciety and is on a Baker Scholar-
ship.

The Award, given annually by
Gamma of Virginia Chapter, goes to
the sophomore with the highest
scholastic average for the first three
semesters of his college career. The
purpose of the award is to encour-
age scholastic endeavor among un-
dergraduates during their first years
at Washington and Lee.

Cahoon is-a graduate of Oscar
Frommel Smith High School, in
South Norfolk, where he was vale-
dictorian of his class. At the end of
his first semester at Washington
and Lee he became a member of
Phi Eta Sigma, freshman academic
honorary society.

The award, established in 1955,
consists of a cash prize of $25 to be
used by the recipient for the pur-
chase of books for his personal li-
brary. Appropriate book plates are
inscribed indicating the significance
of the award.

Republican Party Officials
To Attend Mock Convention

Some of the Republican Party’s
outstanding young leaders will be
special guests at Washington and
Lee University’s 1964 Mock Con-
vention May 4 and 5.

Mock Convention Chairman Philip
D. Sharp, Jr., has announced that
D. E. “Buz” Lukens, chairman of
the Young Republican Party of Vir-
ginia; and John Edward Grenier,
chairman of the Republican Party
in Alabama have accepted invita-
tions to attend.

Other GOP leaders who have
said they will be present include
Mrs. Hazel Barger of Roanoke,
national committeewoman from
Virginia; Richard Obenshain of
of Richmond, chairman of the
Young Republican Federation of
Virginia; Marshall Coleman, a
University of Virginia undergrad-
uate who is chairman of Young
Southerners for Rockefeller; and
Art Groesbeck, acting executive
secretary of the Young Repub-
lican National Federation.

Each will be introduced to the
Mock Convention which will be at-
tempting to nominate the same can-
didate the national party will choose
this summer in San Francisco.

One of Virginia’s Republican cong-
ressmen, Sixth District Rep. Rich-
ard H. Poff, will introduce the
Mock Convention’s keynoter, for-
mer Minnesota Rep. Walter Judd,
who gave the keynote address to
the 1960 Republican National Con-

 

vention.

Lukens has a long list of Repub-
lican “firsts” to his credit. He cre-
ated and organized the first Young
Republican precinct canvassing in
the District of Columbia; is the
founder of the PACE seminars, first
Young Republican professional po-
litical school; and is the originator
of the District of Columbia Young
Republican breakfast featuring sen-
ators, congressmen, community and
political leaders. He has established
the first central office of the Wash-
ington Young Republieans, and as
membership chairman originated a
drive which tripled the city’s Young

Republican membership within 12
months.
As Republican candidate for

Congress from the first district of
Virginia in 1956, Henderson re-
ceived the largest vote of any
non-incumbent candidate in the
South. Under his chairmanship,
the Republican Party of Virginia
gained seats in five city councils
in the 1962 elections.

Henderson atttended the College
of William and Mary, served in the
Army during World War II and
was national president of the U.S.
Junior Chamber of commerce in
1952-53. As a recipient of a Special
Citizenship Award and grant from
the American Heritage Foundation
in 1954, he visited 50 countries or-
ganizing young men’s civic groups
and in Mexico City was named the
“Outstanding Jaycee of the World”

Easter For The Collegian

Education wears different clothes at every school. The
problems and solutions, the worries and joys of life at W&L
don’t seem to be shared by George-at-UNC, Jim-at LSU, or
Dave-at-Denison. We have all been aged in different vats,
and there seems to be nothing to talk about.

Easter is highlighted by the seemingly sad realization that
you no longer have much in common with the old “group.”
The golden “leaders” aren’t leaders any more; the hometown
athletic teams look pitifully small; Sally-next-door has a baby,
and her husband works the night shift in a mill somewhere.

We from W&L will brag about our wrestling or football
team, forget that we have a basketball team, relate various
embarrassing and eventful moments of Fancy Dress and pa-
jama parties, say nasty things about the administration—just
because it is the administration, and generally gripe about
returning to a beautiful, but overly academic, Lexington spring-
time, made bitter by the omnious fact of May exams.

Easter for the college student is also a time of trying in
vain to be really a part of the family again. Or, maybe, it is a
time when we realize that our relationship to our family is not
quite the same as it was before and we ventured off to college.
Thomas Wolfes “you can’t go home again’’ seems sadly ap-
propriate. The love is still there, the grass still needs cutting,
and there is still a crack in the front steps, but the guest towels
in the bathroom are a silent reminder that W&L is “home.”

Perhaps it will mean seemingly unlimited time with the
hometown girl—time to spend too much time with her, un-
consciously trying to make up for three months of road trips
or flick teams.

Easter 1964, no matter how gay and joyous, will still be
clothed in a lingering shame and grief because of the world’s
horror of November ’63. Both human decency and American
democracy were dealt harsh blows on that day. Easter 1964 will
find us thankful that our nation is recovering from this wound.

And, yet, despite our worries about the future and the
general pain of maturing, each of us knows the happiness that
is Easter and spring vacation, and each will leave W&L to-
morrow expecting to experience again this happiness. For
some, Easter 1964 will find its meaning in the events of 2000
years ago. For others, Easter 1964 will find expression in the
sharing of our experience and ourselves. For everyone, Easter
and spring vacation will be a time of joyful relief from the
routine walk up to the hill.

And the Ring-tum Phi takes this opportunity to wish for
you a very happy vacation—in whatever way you choose to
make it.

God Is Dead -- Part Il

 

Church 1964 - Lost Cause?

This week, we continue our role
as the Devil's Advocate against
the Church. “God is dead—Part
One” showed how little founda-
tion there was for placing the
Gospels as any sort of ultimate
authority for truth. Part Two
looks at the Church today and
its new status as a lost cause.

By KEN LANE
Editor-in-Chief

On this Easter weekend, ironically
enough, millions of Americans will
be commemorating the genesis of a
religious faith which, despite a long
and dynamic heritage, has come to
outlive itself and manifest itself
as a withering branch. The churches
this Sunday will be overflowing with
many once-a-year visitors who by
habit alone will pay their respects
to an institution healthy and thriv-
ing on the outside, but mortally dis-
eased and decaying within.

Decline in Europe

 

The decadence of the Christian
Church was most convincingly |
brought to our attention two sum-
mers ago on a tour through Europe. |
In each country we visited, on our |
enquiring about the strength of
the church, the inhabitants respond- |
ed with talk of decline and dimin-|
ishing loyalty. The students especi-
ally were negative on the subject.
“The church in our country is for
old people only. For us, there is no
challenge in it.” What they said was
no exaggeration. On Sundays, the
churches were scarcely half-full and
those attending were mostly middle-
aged or over.

Similarly in the United States,

The appeal of the church is dying.

Vocationally, the church offers no

  

 

challenge comparable to that of
IBM and Wall Street. For exam-

ple, in the fall of 1960, American
Protestants were told that in one

 

year alone the enrollments at
theological seminaries had de- |
creased 5 per cent; since the |

enrollment in the previous year
had been only 20,000, this percent-
age is alarmingly significant.

In 1962, the Christian Century |
magazine sent out questionnaires to|
presidents of the nation’s twenty-|
four leading seminaries. The survey |
showed that the decline in enroll |
ments were in may cases tapering |
off, but still there was a “universal |

 

uneasiness” exhibited by the re-
sponding presidents. The Century
remarked that the presidents of the
seminaries had requested the mag-
azine not to print anything that
“might occasion the slightest slack-
ening of effort or the least bit of
complacency on the part of the
church.” (Nov. 7, 1962.)

Now more than ever, the Church
depends on a large corps of well-
qualified workers if it is to survive.
Yet our young people are not re-
sponding. The church is no longer

Rising Costs
Pose Problem
To US Medicine

By SYD LEWIS
Associate Editor

Medical advancement in this cen-
tury has been astonishing. Life ex-
pectancy since 1900 has increased by
some fifteen years; medical tech-
nology has been revolutionized; the
discovery of additional drugs has
been proceeding at a record pace.
However, this is not enough. There
still exists deficiencies which must
be corrected (such as those named in
last week’s article: infant death rates,
the morality from controlable dis-
eases, shortages of doctors, rising
costs, and price discrimination to
name a few). Mr. Durrette’s argu-
ment implied that medicine in the
U.S. is the best in the world (which
it might be) and therefore our sys-
tem should not be changed. Using
his own type of reasoning, this is
analogous to stating that the Boston
Celtics perennial champions in the
N.A.B., should not try to improve,
for they are the best already!

Rising Medical Costs

Before proceeding further, I must
correct the impression that medi-
cine in the U.S. has not had a rising
cost above other commodities which
Mr. Durrette tried to put across in
his article. It is true that there are
certain categories of goods whose
prices have risen faster than that
of medicine; however, this is the ex-
ception. Using the consumer index
of 1957-1959 with 100 as a basis, all
goods and services (listed on this
chart) have risen to 106.6 while the
cost of medicine has risen to 120.0.
Since 1947, medical services have
risen 164 per cent.

Mr. Durrette has said that there
are no if’s, and’s or but’s—socialized
medicine is taboo. This seems to be
an example of the basic deficiency
in conservative reasoning. Every-
thing to this political group appears
to be black or white. There is one
answer to everything. Yet this is
not the situation. There do exist
alternatives, and as long as this is
the case, we must experiment.

The Porritt Committee

Medicine is no exception to this
approach. Although Mr. Durrette has
given several qualified opinions on
the subject of socialized medicine,
he has not exhausted all views. The
Porritt Committee, whose director
was President of the Royal College
of Surgeons and which was organ-
ized under the auspices of the
British Organization of Medicine, not
the government, released this state-
ment: “Basically, the concept of a
comprehensive national health ser-
vice (in Great Britain) is sound.”
The statement is qualified by the
word basically; however, one must
remember that the present medical
system in Great Britain has existed
only since 1948 and there is no
reason to doubt that the faults will
not be corrected in time.

Anne Ramsay Somer, professor
at Haverford, after returning from
Europe and making first hand obser-
vations said: “...Most doctors in
these countries (Germany, Austria,
and Italy), especially Austria, have
long been enthusiastic supporters of
compulsory health insurance. ..”

giene, University of Toronto—pro-
claimed: “Provincial Hospital In-
surance and Diagnostic Service

Goldwater Position On ‘Peaceful Co-existence’ Clarified

It is true that Goldwater offers
a foreign policy that he believes
would be successful, but he certainly
doesn’t intend to give us a panecea
for all our problems with the Soviet

By HARRY BROOKBY
If senator Goldwater had read Mr.
Lamb’s article, “Negotiations with
the U.S.S.R. ‘Only Way’,” in Tues-
day’s edition of the Ring-tum Phi,

certainly he would voice a_ reply
in defence. Mr. Lamb has every
right to present his political views
toward Russia, but we should also
be allowed to hear more fully the
views of the senator.

Mr. Goldwater disagrees with sev-
eral of Lamb’s points, as may be
seen in the views expressed in the
senator’s book, Why Not Victory? In
the first place, Lamb stated that
“He (Goldwater) even claims to
know what that policy should be.”
Lamb is speaking of the senator’s
“autere and absolute foreign policy.”
Goldwater, however, states in his
book,

“I don’t know all the answers,
and I have very little patience
with those who pretend they do.
None of us here in Washington
knows all or even half of the an-
swers. You people out there in
the fifty states had better under-
stand that.”

 

Union. Just as Lamb gives us an
answer to the communist problem,
i.e., co-existence, Goldwater gives
us another alternative: to attain
victory. Goldwater says, “Victory
is the key to the whole problem;
the only alternative is, obviously,
defeat.” Why does Goldwater not
even consider co-existence, or in
other words, a “tie’? In his book,
he states,

“It is because the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. stand for two antitheti-
cal concepts of the nature of man.
Our commitment is to things of
eternal value—we believe in truth
and honor and justice and the lib-
erty and dignity of man. The Rus-
sian doctrine is dedicated, in the
words of Stalin, ‘to the destruc-
tion of all capitalist society....
The individual is of no importance
except as he serves the state...
The end is justifiable by any
means,”

 

In the light of these facts, Gold-
water cannot see how we can ration-
ally say the answer is to “co-exist”
with those who have boldly stated
and dedicated themselves to our
destruction.

Co-existence

Lamb said that the answer to the
communist problem is to “co-exist”
with the Soviets because the only
other alternative is war, and “total
war is no longer a rational alter-
native.” Goldwater would agree to
the foolishness of war from the com-
munist point of view because they
are accomplishing their prime objec-

tive without having to bomb us.
The senator states,
“The Communist do not view

war as a ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ affair. To
them conflict is a continuing action
everywhere. At the moment, this
Russian strategy does not con-
template armed _ conflict, but
Khrushchev has never abandoned
the possibility of fighting to gain
his total end.”
Lamb stated

that the leaders of

 

“East and West” scorn war because

of the “unimaginable potential of
modern weapons.” Thus, Goldwater
and Lamb differ on the reason that
Khrushchev does not want war.
Does the concept “rational alterna-
tive” mean the same thing to John-
son that it does to Khurshchev? At
any rate, Goldwater and Lamb seem
to agree that war is unacceptable
to both East and West at the pres-
ent time.

More Faith

Lamb makes a further assump-
tion that both sides, seeing that war
is futile, will never risk starting a
war. He seems to have more faith
in the rational nature of the Com-
munist than Mr. Goldwater does.
Nevertheless, Goldwater and Lamb
agree that one of four alternatives,
i.e, war, should not be our major
objective in dealing with the Soviet
Union. Defeat, or a policy of letting
the Communists destroy our free-

doms is obviously another unac-
ceptable alternative to both Gold-
water and Lamb. We have seen
both persons’ views towards the
third alterna‘ive—co-existence. This
leaves the final alternative pre-

 

sented: victory. Goldwater asks,

“Can victory be achieved with-
out a nuclear war? My vociferous
critics would like us to believe that
there can be no communist war
victory without the destruction of
civilization. This is precisely
what the communists would like
us to believe. Their whole line of
attack through propaganda and
adroit economic, political, and mil-
itary moves, is directed toward
making us think in terms of fear.
They want to make sure that we
believe the risk is too great to
employ our strength. Their pur-
pose is intimidation and it is work-
ing too well.

“The choice is not yield or fight
a nuclear war. It is: win, or fight
a nuclear war. For a nuclear war
we shall certainly have to fight,
from whatever beleagured outpost
we are reduced to oecupying, if
we continue to yield, piece by
piece, all over the world. Finally,
in desperation, we would see the
horrible alternatives clearly in
view—a violent act of nuclear ag-
gresison or surrender, Our only

 

hope is to proclaim victory as our
aim and then to press boldly and
unremittingly on all fronts— al-
ways prepared to fight and making
sure the Communists always know
we are prepared to fight, as they
knew in the incidents at Quemoy,
Matsu, Lebanon, and in the Ber-
lin airlift,”

Alternatives

Thus, we have seen the positive
and negative alternatives of Sena-
tor Goldwater and Mr. Lamb. The
difference of their alternatives to
the communist menace seems to lie
in their different understandings of
the principles of Communism. Lamb
has faith in the possibility of the
compatibility of Communism and
in the future, while Goldwater looks
at the history of the last forty years,
and he sees that, “Communism is
an international conspiracy which
has restored slavery to the world
in vast geographic proportions.” He
sees no future utopia in a world
marked by past and present strife,
and he recognizes that we are en-
gaged in a war—“not a cold one, but
the Communist War
win it.”

W&L Ties Bucknell,
Loses to Williams

Two seasons opened here yester-
day afternoon.

W&L’s baseball team played to a
darkness-shortened 11-11 ten inning
tie with Bucknell. The Bisons had
lost three games in the previous
three days.

Meanwhile, as expected, the la-
crosse team lost to Williams, but
unexpectedly, by only four goals.

Williams won 9-5

Four-Base Error

The baseball game, played in a
Smith Field wind storm, was a
comedy of errors climaxed when

W&L centerfielder Gene Gillespie
dropped Joe Elliot’s fly ball in the
tenth inning. Elliot scored on the
four-base error.

Skip Chase went on to single,
steal and score in the bottom of the
inning, to tie. The Generals’ stolen
bases enabled them to stay in the
game. They stole nine.

Bucknell ..213 013 000 1—11 13 I1
MG sua 503 000 110 1—11 9 5
Hegmann, Lombardi (3), Elliot
(8) and Gallagher. Wigert and
Crenshaw.

The Generals committed five er-
rors, the Bisons 11. Bucknell short-
stop John Minsker took individual
honors with five. Only one W&L
run was earned.

Bucknell scored first, two runs on
four walks and no hits off pitcher
Chris Wigert in the first inning.
Wigert went the distance, walking
nine and striking out 11.

W&L moved into the lead on
Tom Crenshaw’s three-run homer,
but the Bisons singled their way
back to a 10-8 sixth inning lead.
The Generals tied it on unearned
runs resulting from two of Minsker’s
errors.

W&L opens its spring trip to-
morrow at Pfeiffer College. Coach
Joe Lyles will take 21 men but only
six pitchers. He said yesterday right-
hander Mason McGowin will be lost
for the season with a sore arm.

After the Pfeiffer game, the Gen-
erals meet Fort Bragg in a three-
game series. Lyles said he will have

 

to use freshman pitchers in that
series, which could turn out to be
a massacre.

Thursday, Friday and Saturday
W&L plays at Frederick, Old Do-
minion and Fort Lee. The team re-
turns home April 7, when it will
meet Castelton State.

Size, Speed Win

The lacrosse game, marked by ex-
ceptionally aggressive play, saw the
precision stickwork, size, and super-
ior speed of the Williams ten pre-
vail easily over the better condition-
ing of the W&L stickmen.

Williams was solidly superior in
every department, especially on at-
tack where vaunted attackman Tim-
my Baker had five assists.

The Generals’ attack game seemed
solid on those occasions when the
midfield succeeded in clearing the

 

Better Sports News

 

ball to them ,and even the big,
alert Williams defensemen could not
entirely stop Carroll Klingelhofer
(three goals) and John McDaniel
(two goals and two assists). Wil-
liams’ Annison was high scorer with
four goals.
Passing Improves

W&L’s passing game appeared
much improved since the Tuesday
scrimmage with Swarthmore, which
the Generals dropped 5-3, but their
inside feeding and coverage of
ground balls was still weak.

The Generals face Hofstra tomor-
row. Hofstra, lacking the size and
raw talent of Williams, has at least
an equivalent amount of experience
and will probably have even better
speed.

Trackmen Face
Old Dominion

Washington and Lee University’s
track team faces its toughest chal-
lenge of the season when it meets
Old Dominion College here this af-
ternoon.

The Generals, who lost to Old
Dominion 69-53 last year, will have
their work cut out for them again
this year.

Old Dominion boasts strength in
the dashes, hurdles, and jumps
where the Generals are weakest. In
addition the Monarchs can match
W&L in both depth and quality in
the Generals’ best events—the mile
and two-mile.

Distance men Lee Johnson, Charlie
Head, Riff O’Connor, and Andy Kil-
patrick, weight man Gaylord Gas-
que, and jumper Robin Kell form
the brunt of the W&L attack.

Chris Kell, recovering from a
pulled muscle which sidelined him
in 1963, gives W&L a _ top-notch
sprinter, but the Generals lack
depth here and in the 440. In the
880, sophomore Jim Thompson and
freshman Bill Wildrick form a good
one-two punch.

“If we could only get everybody
together at once, we would be con-
siderably stronger,” said coach
Norm Lord.

Tennis Trip To Open;
Eight Men To Meet W-F

Coach Bill Washburn’s _ tennis
team will begin a series of nine
spring vacation matches tomorrow
at Wake Forest.

Eight men will make the trip, the
first of its kind for W&L tennis
teams.

“Things look encouraging. We’ve
had more time to practice this year
than in the last few years, so the
team is farther along,” said Wash-
burn.

“It is difficult to say what our
chances are on this first spring trip.
Fort Eustis will be very strong and
so will the (Qld Providence) Rac-
ket Club.”

Old Dominion is the only vacation
opponent the Generals met last year.
W&L won then, 6-3.

Jim DeYoung, Randy Jones, Jim
Mell, Lindsey Short and Forrest
Dickinson will play the five top
spots. Howard Busse and Fred
Webb will alternate at the number
six spot.

Freshman Phil Thompson will go
along as a member of the number
two doubles team.

 

  
  

 
  

aN there
by Tim OKe efe

If you’ve ever thought of going into
baseball umpiring, Danny McDevitt,
former pitcher with the Los Angeles
Dodgers and the New York Yankees,
has these tips to pass on.

“You’ve got to have a real ap-
pearance of strength. You've got
to make your voice sound like it has
authority. And you've got to work
on developing your muscles in the
larynx,” he says.

McDevitt says that one of the
best training aids is a mirror. Then
you can practice snarling at your-
self and you “get to see for your-
self how things look.”

He had to give up pitching last
year when he had adhesions and
tendonitis.

“For adhesions you’re supposed to
throw and for tendonitis you’re sup-
posed to rest. There didn’t seem
any way out of it.”

New York has often been called
a city of great contrasts. Now it has
one more.

The New York Mets, the worst
baseball team in the National
League, this year will have the
NL’s best park. Some have called
this the finest baseball stadium
ever built.

All seats are faced toward sec-
on base or the 50-yard line (The
Jets of the AFL play there in the
winter) and there isn’t a post in
the place.

There also aren’t any bleachers—
only 55,000 bolted seats, painted dif-
ferent shades of green, blue, organge
and yellow.

And for the fans who can’t stand
to watch the Mets—10th last year,
favored to repeat—there are 21 es-
calators that will rapidly take them
out,

Across the street the World’s Fair
will be playing for the next two
years.

ized medicine) is well accepted by

hospital associations, the medical

profession, and the public. ..”
Need for Adaptation

The above are just a few of the
many qualified opinions supporting
socialized medicine. But these do not
validate the claim that we should
institute socialized medicine. Amer-
ica has circumstances different from
other countries. If socialized medi-
cine is to be tried in the US., it
must be under a special adaptation
for the United States. For if one
says what is good and bad for other
countries will be the same for the
United States, then it is necessary
to condemn capitalism as we know
it, for this system has failed in every
European country.

I believe the main corrections
which should be made in medicine
revolve around rising costs. There
should be a change in the institu-
tional administration of medicine,
such as more group practices, finan-
cial means of payment reforms, both
private and public, and at the same
time maintain as our basis a policy
which would be acceptable to the
American people.

Moreover, there must be more
federal and state aid to education
to induce more students to apply to
medical school. It is alarming to

Church Decline

competing with other, more chal-
lenging concerns. Here, then, is an
organization dying at its very life
center. In the remaining install-
ments of this series, we shall look
beyond these exterior symptoms in
an effort to determine some of the
significant causes of the church’s
decline.

NOTE: The purpose of | this
series is partly to test the de-
gree to which readers are con-
cerned about the issue of Christi-
anity and the Church. If, as the
catalogue states, we are “dedi-
cated to the Christian ideal,” then
the iconoclastic approach we have
assumed should hit right to the
core of the University’s sentsitivi-
ties.

The only way we can tell wheth-
er students are concerned or not
is through the feedback of our
readership. So far, we have re-
ceived only favorable reaction.
Does this indicate that the tenti-
ment of the student body is like-
wise cynical?

Optimistically believing this is
a subject toward which the Uni-
versity is not apathetic, we invite
letters of comment from both stu-
dents and faculty.

FASHIONS

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, esauine’s Fashion Director Ser

With Easter vacation already flashing the “Walk” sign, why not
decide before you go home on your number one suit and the rest of
your wardrobe. Aside from the traditional dress-up holiday, there
may be decisive interviews for either a summer job or a permanent
one if you’re a graduating senior—-and the clothes you wear—plus
the way that you wear them—make the pivotal first impression.
You want it to be right at first sight, so, let’s take a run-down on
what you might well select this Spring in fashion. pes

YOUR NUMBER ONE SUIT for warmer

weather is next to weightless in the new lighter-
than-ever flannels and polyester/wool blends.
Color-wise, consider the more definite blues, the
new lighter greys; see the classic Glen Urquhart
or ‘glen’ plaids.

THE GIFT OF ‘GAB’ you get with the return of

natural tan gabardine. Its fine diagonal twill
weave and surface sheen make it an excellent
choice for your Number One Suit. Today’s gab-
ardines also come in lighter weight wools and
new polyester/wool blends.

 

 

   

PRIDE OF THE OUTFIT: REGIMENTAL

STRIPES ... the resurgence noted by ESQUIRE
last fall is gaining momentum for Regimental
Stripes—the traditional colors of the historic
“m, British regiments. With scores of these famed
“atte! regiments—like the Grenadier Guards, the
, Royal Fusiliers, the Inskilling Dragoons—
there’s quite a roll-call of striking color com-
binations in pure silk repps for your selection.

DRESS SHIRTS—SHOES—BELT .... white Button Down Oxfords

are still very much de rigeur, and there are handsome variations in
narrow tape stripes of blue, grey, olive. Also, although you ‘can’t
go wrong’ with a white broadcloth tab collar dress shirt, why not
