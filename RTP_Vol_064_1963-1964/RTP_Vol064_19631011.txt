Leadership Group Confers,
Plans Formal Organization

How can we instill a campus esprit de corps’ Can we ef.-

fectively revive our traditions?

These were two basic questions which were treated at
the first Washington and Lee University Leadership Confer-
ence. It was held Wednesday night in the Evans private dining
hall, under the sponsorship of the national leadership frater-

nity, Omicron Delta Kappa.

Before an assembly of some six-
ty student leaders and twenty fac-
ulty members, ODK president Don
Partington stated in his introduc-
tory remarks that the purpose of
the new body was to “create mutual
respect among the student organiza-
tions” and provide a way for stu-
dent leaders to “discuss and share
mutual goals.”

Noell Speaks

In a five-minute address, student
body president Bill Noell stressed
the significance of W&L’s leaders
working as “an integrated whole.”
Noell divided his talk into the
“W&L spirit,” the “W&L man,” and
the “W&L leader.”

In his talk, Noell commented on
the discrepancy between what the
freshman is told about Washington
and Lee and what he sees. Noell re-
marked that the leaders of W&L
are confronted with the challenge
to breach this gap between the real
and ideal, to create an “atmosphere
conducive to the development and
communication” in the University.

Noell’s address was followed by
comments from the floor in which
the possibilities for the organization
were discussed and analyzed. It was
concluded that the newly formed
group would first provide a way for
student organizations to work to-
gether and, secondly, act as an outlet
for student feelings.

Officers Elected

During the conference, Jud Reis,
Phi Psi senior, was elected presi-
den ;Bill Burke, Beta freshman law
student, vice-president.

A steering committee is being se-
lected to help coordinate the new
organization under common objec-
tives. Students and faculty mem-
bers interested in contributing ideas
about the posible services of this
organization are encouraged to send
them in to the W&L Student Leader-
ship Organization, care of the Execu-
tive Committee.

The selections to the steering
committee will be announced next
week.

The purpose of the Wednesday’s
conference, according to Partington,
was to raise problems and questions
dealing with campus activities.

Rededication of Chapel
Highlights Homecomings

Alumni returning for Washing-
ton and Lee University’s annual
Homecoming tomorrow will be treat-
ed to special guided tours of the
newly-restored Lee Chapel.

Coffee will be served in the
Chapel’s Lee Museum from 10:30
a.m. until 11:45 a.m., but tours for
alumni and wives will begin at 10
a.m.

Although the Chapel reopened its
doors to the public in August, Sat-
urday’s open house will show for the
first time new display cases in the
Lee Museum which were especially
designed to accommodate the hun-
dreds of items of Lee memorabilia.

The custom built cases arrived and |

were installed earlier this week.

Other items on the Homecoming
program include a_faculty-alumni

luncheon in Evans Dining Hall at! the Young Republicans to a public
noon, and the = p.m. football game | i Young Democrat President

on Wilson Field between the un-
beaten Washington and Lee Gener-
Colonels from Contre
College of Kentucky. A Homecom-
ing queen will be crowned at half-
time.

After the game, alumni
vited back to Evans Hall for coffee,
sandwiches, and an opportunity to
meet Coach Lee McLaughlin, other
members of his staff, and the Wash-
ington and Lee football squad.

Missing from the Homecoming

program this year is the competition |

among Washington and Lee fraterni-
ties for the most appropriately dec-
orated fraternity house. The Uni-
versity’s alumni-faculty committee
requested the fraternities refrain
from decorating this year, so as not
to intrude upon the dignity and

Homecoming activities were plan-
ned by the faculty committee headed
by Dr. Edward F. Turner, professor
of physics. William C. Washburn,
executive alumni secretary, is in
charge of arrangements. The alumni
are scheduled to register between
nine a.m. and noon tomorrow in the
Student Union.

 

Young Demos
Issue Challenge
To Republicans

Washington and Lee’s new Young
Democrats club met for the first
time Tuesday night and challenged

Eckes issued the challenge and
- asked the Forensic Union to
sponsor the debate.

The Young Democrats, who organ-
ized at the end of the last school
year, were 21 strong at the opening
meeting which was held in the
Student Union. Dr. Milton Colvin
was present at the meeting and spoke
briefly to the group.

The projected debate is intended
to introduce a new spirit to the
campus, which up until now has
allowed the Young Republicans a!
monopoly on political life. It would
also arouse interest in the approach-
ing 1964 elections.

Subsequent meetings of the Young
Democrats will be announced on}
campus bulletin boards. Eckes asked |

SWMSFC Elects
Eleven Students
To Membership

Eleven W&L men are to become
new members of the Student War
Memorial Scholarship Fund Com-
mittee.

Among those
juniors; Joe Bear,
Carrell, SAE;
Phi Kap.

Sophomores Chosen

Sophomore George Bokinsky, Phi
Kap SAE sophomore Charles Giffin,
and Phi Delt sophomore Birnie Har-
per were also selected.

Five more sophomores complete
the list, with ZBT contributing two—
Steve Sweitzer and Charles Walker.
Neely Young represents Sigma Chi;
Rick Richmond, Beta, and David
Marchese, Phi Gam.

SWMSFC picked these students
after it organizational meeting Mon-
day night. Scholastic, and extra-
curricular qualifications and their
money-making suggestions served as
criteria in making the choices.

$3,000 Given

The purpose of the organization
is to raise funds for scholarships.
Last year the group presented
$3,000 to the university to be used
for scholarships. This represented
three years’ work.

President Randy Wootton has said
that he hopes the group will be
able to present another $3,00 to
W&L in two years.

Program Revamped

To accomplish this goal SWMSFC
has revamped its money program.
This year a series of 10 money
raising projects will be undertaken.
Each project will be headed by a
definite chairman.

Among the projects are selling
rings, Christmas cards stationery,
concessions and graduation invita-
tions, a clothes raffle and a spring
concert.

. Greenville, South Carolina, served as President of the Student
* Body and as President of the School

Executive Committee. Kendricks
gained experience for the offices by
serving as Treasurer and Secretary
of the student body in his sophomore
and junior years, respectively.

Academically, Kendrick has also
excelled, being an honor roll student
for four years in high school which
resulted to his election to the Na-
tional Honor Society in his junior
year—an honor usually reserved for
seniors.

Kendrick combined his leadership
and scholarship talents with ath-
letics, serving as captain of the
school track and football teams.
Furthermore, he holds a Carnegie
Medal for lifesavings.

As a freshman at Washington and
Lee, Kendricks has containued to
participate in school affairs as tri-
captain of the freshman football
team, a member of the University
Christian Association, and an officer
in his fraternity pledge class.

Elections for this office between
Kendricks and an unannounced Pri-
gressive Candidate will be held Mon-
day, October 21, 1963. In recent years
the freshmen voting have stuck in
general to party lines; however the
reallignment of parties last year
bringing the relative strength closer
and with the uncertain consequences
of a greater independent vote, it
will be excedingly difficult to pre-
dict the outcome of this year’s elec-
tion.

UP chairman Al Eckes issued the
following statement:

“The most important functions
of a Washington and Lee political
party is to nominate outstanding
candidates who will represent the
entire student body. Too often other
campus parties have selected their
candidates so that selected frater-
nities maintain their “gravy-train”
monopoly of campus offices. W&L
has seen many candidates chosen
with few qualifications.

“The University Party condemns
such behavior and urges the other
campus political party to nominate
a candidate with demonstrated ex-
perience and ability this year.

“Bryant Kendrick was selected to
represent the University Party on
the basis of his outstanding high
school record, his achievement on
the Washington and Lee campus,
and his honest desire to represent
all freshmen as a member of the
Executive Committee. He is, with-
out a doubt, the best-qualified fresh-
man to run for this important post
in recent years.

“I urge all freshmen—fraternity
and nonfraternity students—to meet
Bryant, to examine his qualifications,
and to compare him with the nom-
inee of the Progressive Party bosses.”

this afternoon in a ceremony mark-| sented a short talk as spokesman for

ed by simplicity characteristic of the |
original dedication nearly a century |

The Chapel was built under the |
supervision of General Lee when |
he was president of the College |

and was originally dedicated on June

18, 1868 in a simple ceremony in
connection with commencement of |
that year.

Today’s ceremony was preceded by

a program of organ music presented

by Dr. James G. Leyburn, pro-
fessor of sociology. The program was
presented on the Chapel’s Eben
pipe organ, which was installed in

the Chapel in 1872 and was rebuilt

Speaking of Lee Chapel as a

said, in part, “There are many sta-
tues, many memorials and _ tributes
to Robert E. Lee throughout our
country, but I know I speak for all
Lee descendants when I say that
this Chapel the most honored
memory of all.”

He added, “

“on behalf of the Lee family and
all others who cherish the memory
of Robert E. Lee,” to the Ford Motor

Company Fund who financed the
restoration of the Chapel, and to
the University.

His talk was followed by remarks
from Benson Ford, president of the
|Ford Motor Company Fund. He
stated that this was the first time

that the fund has allocated money
for a project of historical restoration.
He said that the decision was made
“in the spirit of my grandfather who
believed strongly in the value
reconstructing and preserving out-
standing examples of our national
past an inspiration and _ lesson
for our future.”

He closed his speech
following: “As consecrated

this Chapel can, we believe, cement
a new and necessary understanding

He also expressed his gratitude,| among all parts of our nation.

 

The recumbent statute of General Lee located in the newly

|rededicated Lee Chapel.

 

By dramatizing the selfless ded-
ication of Robert E. Lee to the prin-
ciples of honor, human dignity,
learning and “the thorough educa-
tion of all classes of the people,” this
Chapel can be become a symbol of
the fundamental values that unite
us all.

“Tt will truly enshrine the mem-
ory of Robert E. Lee. Then perhaps
in years to come, people, in think-
ing of him, will not say he led an
army in service of half of a nation.
Instead, they will say he led a
school in service of all mankind.”

The talks were concluded with
a brief speech by President Cole on
behalf of the University. The W&L
Glee Club then sang “With a Voice
of Singing” by Martin Shaw and
the benediction was delivered by
the Rey. Dr. John Newton Thomas
of Richmond, a member of the Board
of Trustees. The program was closed
by the singing of “College Friend-
ships” by the Glee Club.

A Followup

Cheering at last Saturday’s football game showed a marked
improvement. Thanks to the Varsity Club, Southern Sem
cheerleaders, and a well-played game, the response from the
bleachers was a heart-warming change from the customary
deadness.

However, the spirit exhibited last week will mean absolutely
nothing unless it is perpetuated. Homecomings tomorrow af-
fords the ideal opportunity to make a successful follow-up of
a hopeful beginning—let’s give these alumni something to talk
about when they go back home!

An Asset To Student Needs?

The conference of campus leaders last Wednesday night
might very well launch a new epoch in student body activities.
If carried through successfully, the new organization should
provide a critical avenue for concerted action from within the
student body.

The organization penetrates every area of student affairs;
it represents a wide cross-section of campus viewpoints. We
consequently feel that one of the most promising possibilities
of such a group lies in its potentiality as an effective medium
for exploring student needs and affording them proper ex-
pression.

Numerous other, more concrete possibilities are equally
as promising. The organization is presently engaged in select-
ing a steering committee and drawing up some definite ob-
jectives. Members of the student body and the faculty who
have any suggestions or comments to offer, particularly on the
needs which such an organization might meet, are urged by
chairman Jud Reis to write them in. Suggestions should be
mailed to the W&L Student Leadership Organization, care of
The Executive Committee, Washington and Lee University.

 

Big-Name Entertainers

Washington and Lee has enjoyed a high degree of social
prestige among southern colleges. This status is attributed
largely to our annual four Dance Set Weekends, which have
presented such big-time entertainers as Louis Armstrong,
Count Basie, and Lionel Hampton.

With the idea of carrying on his high standard of enter-
tainment, Dance Board president Ed Croft has scheduled
an outstanding line-up for the coming season. In addition to
Hamilton and Price for Openings, Croft has confided to us
that a contract is under way for Ian and Sylvia for the Fancy
Dress Ball. He further revealed that he had tentatively con-
tracted Ray Charles and Chad Mitchell for Springs, and the
Smothers Brothers for Finals.

Croft remarked that these groups have not been officially
announced since they do not represent definite contracts.
However, he assured us that they were available and we can
get them depending on the student response to next week’s
Dance Plan sales.

So, if this is the entertainment that you, as students, want
for the coming year, the Dance Board will have to have your
support. They can get these groups with the student body be-
hind them.

Republicans Seek ‘Gimmick
For 1965 Presidential Race

a new tax plan. Ironically enough,
Goldwater once wrote “a little piece”
on how the Volstead Act and the
income tax amendment affected
American morals. This sounds
strangely like the materialistic de-

At present, the only active, well-

Rather than seeking a common
political ground with which to ef-

 

fectively oppose the Kennedy Ad-
ministration, Republicans seem to
want a new slant, a gimmick to
spring on the public. Recognizing
the Democrat’s success at selling the
package politics in the forms of the
New and Fair deals and the New
Frontier, a voiceful faction of the
Republican Party believes in push-
ing their reluctant messiah, Barry
Goldwater, and his brand of “Con-
servatism.”

Senator Goldwater has been al-
lowed to run around in the party
like a native witch doctor chanting
cures for the country’s ills and
has built up a vigorous following
of promoters and publicists. But
even he, as the possibility of fac-
ing a tough political contest rapid-
ly approaches, has been gradually
shifting his stand.

In his autobiography, Goldwater
wrote that he opposed a progressive
income tax in favor of a fixed rate
tax. To institute such a measure it
would be necessary to raise the
taxes of nine out of ten taxpayers.
In the face of the generally accepted
fact that a tax cut is needed to spur
economy, the Senator now says he
would modify his position and have

 

known force of political stability and
dynamic policy in the Republican
Party revolves around Governor
Rockefeller. New York State under
Rockefeller has been able to work
out problems which will appear as
national issuse in the Presidential
campaign. The state has brought
its fiscaly policy into balance and
has gone on a “Pay-as-you-go” ba-
sis. And as a direct result of this,
state aid to education has been in-
creased, 500 million in the last year
as over five years ago. Fundamental
civil rights laws prohibiting dis-
crimination in social and economic
areas now exist in New York sta-
tutes.

Obviously, as Governor Rockefeller
has said, debate within the party
ranks can serve as a creative for-
mat for platform programs and
awaken the public to basic issues.
But unfortunately, a party of split
interests will be very easily bowled
over by the Kennedy machine.

THE RING-TUM PHI

W&L Junior Relates His Experiences

In East African Summer

By DAVID COHN

The seriousness of the average
African is one of the chief differ-
ences that sets him apart from the
average American, according to a
W&L junior, who spent eleven
weeks in Kenya this summer.

As a representative of the Virginia
Baptist Student Union, Malcolm
Morris traveled throughout East
Africa working under the direction
of the Southern Baptist Foreign
Mission Board. While there he had
the opportunity to work both with
African students in high school and
with African Christians in small
Baptist churches.

In Mombasa, a coastal city, Mor-
ris worked in Mombasa Baptist High
School for six weeks, with thirty-
six ninth grade African students.
His job included conducting a Bible

Class as well as several extra-cur-

ricular activities.

“My job was to both teach and
learn. Through my teaching exper-
iences, I sought to gain a clear pic-
ture of the way of life in Kenya.
The most important part of my job
is trying to express now what needs
I experienced among the people of
East Africa.”

In addition to holding the six
days a week classes, the tasks of
organizing a debate group, a Baptist
student union, and a_ volleyball
team fell under his charge. Sunday
mornings were devoted to speaking
through interpreters at several
African churches, while the eve-
nings were spent speaking at the
English speaking churches in Mom-
basa.

“The Keyans that I met were quite

 

 

serious about every facet of their
lives. They were intensely loyal to
their religious beliefs whatever they
might be. They were extrmely proud
of their nation and intensely loyal to
their political parties and leaders.
To young and old alike education
was one of the most important things
in life.”

In the midst of this busy schedule,
Morris found time for hunting sa-
faris and roaming throughout the
ancient city of Mombasa and the
surrounding countryside.

In addition, political rallies were

Salaam Baptist Church in Tanganika.

 

i oe

an extra attraction. On one occa-
sion he heard Jomo Kenyatta, the
formerly imprisoned Mau Mau lead-
er who is to be Kenya’s first prime
minister following her December 12
independence from Britain.

At one point during the rally a
fierce verbal attack was made against
the press. Morris, toting a camera,
was mistaken for a journalist. Soon
a government official ordered him
to photograph a near roit that was
developing. Morris, in the midst of
twenty thousand Africans, had no
alternative but to obey.

 

Mottley Commends New Flicks
For Being “Truthful To Novels’

By BOB MOTTLEY

Three novels are making cine-
matic premiers in New York through
adaptations that are surprisingly
truthful to the original accounts:
Anton Chekhov's The Steppe (which
concerns a young boy’s journey
through 19th Century Russia) has
been compellingly filmed in Italy,
and stars Charles Vanel; Leo Tol-
stoi’s Resurrection is absorbing and
jarring in the hands of an all-Rus-
sian cast and director. His thesis
that a guilt-stricken prostitute may
become spiritually regenerated is
beautiful art, perhaps, but after re-
cent scandals in England, American
viewers are likely to misinterpret its
moral, having been conditioned by
the mass media to eat their Rice-
Davies with snap, crackle and pop
instead of piety. Henry Fielding’s
Tom Jones emerges on the screen
with vivid elan, sparked by a witty
British cast starring Albert Fin-
ney and Susannah York.

“Lord of the Flies”

On the other side of the coin,
two widely known books have not
been made into successful movies—

the British hideously bungled Gold-| ™

ing’s Lord of the Flies by milk-
sopping the author’s trenchant style,
and things are not going well with

The Bible, a composite assimilation] 4

of the Holy Word by certain Italian
directors that won’t win the Golden
Beanie for this or any other year.
I shudder to think of the end result
of this travesty of all cinematic
travesties—it would be apropos if
the Second Coming coincided with
its world premiere.

Locally, the Lyric will soon offer
Bergman’s The Seventh Seal, Jean
Genet’s The Balcony (which the
grande dames shouldn’t miss), and
Akira Kurosawa’s Rashamon; in
contrast, Bye, Bye, Birdie is pend-
ing at the State. (I prefer not to
think of this “musical,” as it repre-
sents the only time in my life when
I physically vomited in a theater,
not at Ann-Margret, but during the
apotheosis of Ed Sullivan.)

Prostitution of Talent

The VIP’s was conceived by
M-G-M to cash in while the mink
was warm on the chief stars of
Fox’s wretched Cleopatra, Terrence
Rattigan’s screenplay sets a new
high water sewarge mark for Holly-
wood: a group of the Very Affluent
go into a schizophrenic funk at the
London Airport when their jet is
grounded by a bloody fog. Cherfully
and capably leading the hand-
wringing are Margaret Rutherford
and Orson Welles (without a Mar-
tian in sight), while trailing far,
far behind are the two luminaries
for whom the whole slick package
was fondly prepared. Elizabeth Tay-
lor’s acting, so inferior to her other
capacity, is unusually threadbare
here; Richard Burton makes a pos-

 

itive ass of himself, which is at
least an improvement on his per-
formance in Cleopatra. Why in the
name of all that is Welsh and holy
does this great actor continue to
prostitute his abilities in fatuous
cinema productions? His diction
alone is the best we have had since
Peter Marshall’s (no other compar-
ison is implied); only Burton could
bring off with such shattering force a
line as trite as his reply to a query
about the location of a RAF buddy
in The Longest Day: “At the bot-
tom of the Channel.” This is—ap-
proximately—his own position in
dramatic circles, but it does not
have to be so.

 

Superiority on Stage
Burton has two peers in the legiti-
mate theater: Sir Laurence Oliver

and Sir John Gielgud; he has per-|

sonally contributed a definite Cor-
iolanus and a Hamlet that swept
the boards of the old Vic at a time
when Hamlets had to be box-office
or else. It is obvious in evrey one
of his films from The Robe to The
VIP’s that the camera cannot cap-
ture what mesmerizes the stage in a
Burton performance. Unlike Taylor,
one can willingly forgive him for
anything on the basis of his im-
mense talent, and it will be a happy
day at Stratford when this amazing,

P.E. classes are busy disspelling the
rumor of the soft American.

As any student knows, it is im-
possible to achieve any goals at
all in college, if he cannot do a
hundred pushups, thirty squat jumps
or run a mile without taking a
deep breath. Once again this year
though, only half the freshman class
is able to do these things. The
“weaker students” are presently
trying to perfect these vital skills,
for they realize that without these
necessities academic excellence
would be unattainable. The more
fortunate ones, however, are mean-

It is not until the sophomore year
that the brains of the class are

Adventure

From Mombasa Morris’s work sent
him to Dar-es-Salaam, Tanganika,
where for a week he conducted
evening services at Kinondoni
Baptist Church. Trips by plane, car,
and bus took him to the countries of
Zanzibar and Uganda, and to the
Victorian source of the Nile River
and to Lake Victoria.

At the end of the summer, Morris
joined a five-day safari climbing the
19,340 foot high Mt. Kilamanjaro in
Tanganyika, Africa’s highest peak.
In a party with six British residents
of the area and several African
porters, Morris and one other climb-
er were the only ones to survive
altitude sickness, and sub-zero
weather to finally reach the edge
of the crater rim that is the top.
However, the W&L student found
his moment of triumph briefly
tainted by an attack of altitude
sickness immediately upon reaching
the top.

Besides the wreath of flowers that
is the traditional reward for reach-
ing Kilamanjaro’s summit Morris
brought back “countless rewarding
memories, and friendships,” hun-
dreds of colored slides, and numer-
ous African carvings.

 

Jazz Program
Is Announced
For Sunday

On Sunday evening, October 13,
1963, the Westminister Fellowship
of the Lexington Presbyterian
Church will present a program on
“Jazz, Theology, and Authenticity,”
beginning at 7. Mr. Charles B. Cast-
ner will provide most of the jazz,
Mr. Douglas C. Chase will provide
most of the theology.

Mr. Castner graduated from Wash-
ington and Lee in 1952. During his
undergraduate days, Charlie helped
lead a six-piece, all-campus Dixie-
land jazz band, the W&L “Stomp-
ers.

Mr. Charles B. Castner

Mr. Castner now work in Louis-

ville for the Louisville-Nashville
Railroad. He recently organized an-
other Dixieland band composed of
business and professional men.

Coming from a musical family,
Charlie became interested in jazz
from a Negro hired man who work-
ed around the Castner residence.
Charlie bought his first jazz records
in 1939 and has been collecting rec-
ords, music and data on jazz ever
since.

Mr. Chase is the minister of the
Lexington Presbyterian Church. A
lifetime musician, he has played in
several bands before entering the
ministry and is an accomplished
pianist.

Supper is served at 6:15. The pro-
gram begins at 7:00.

W&L To Face Centre For Homecomings

W & L Generals To Meet |
Centre In First CAC Game

Centre College moves into Lex-
ington tomorrow to face Washing-
ton and Lee’s powerful Generals in
the local homecoming tilt. The game
to be played on Wilson Field at
2:00 p.m. will be the first CAC
conference game for coach Lee Mc-
Laughlin’s charges, who are shooting
for their 29th victory in their last
31 contests.

“Took for a surprise,” said coach

Mac as he summed up the Danville, | @

Kentucky, team. “They’re a hustling

ball club who mix their plays well||-

from a ‘Wing-T’ and ‘double wing’.”

“Their biggest threat will come
from the Jackson brothers. The
older of the two is a fine quarter-
back who started for the University
of Kentucky last season. His young-
er brother plays fullback and runs
well.”

Centre, 1-1 this season, beat con-

ference Southwestern last week 20-| |

8. According to coach Buck Leslie,
who scouted the game, Centre
showed “100 per cent improvement
over the week before when they
outplayed Maryville for three quar-
ters, but lost 20-7.”

The major problem facing coach
McLaughlin is his team’s inability
to score early in the game. In W&L’s
first game against Randolph-Macon,
the Generals had to score late in
the second half to put the game out
of reach. Last week they fell be-

     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

managed to win 29-13.

“No, we're not going to change
our attack much. We like to play
percentage ball. We'll adjust to their
defense.” Johnny McDaniel proved
last week that the Generals do have
an air game to go with the fine run-

hind 7-0 to Oberlin before they| ning of Stuart Yoffe, Henry Sackett,

Predictions And

Questions Time

USC By 20; Staunton Wins 81-0

This writer is offering his readers
one of the few sure things in mod-
ern football this week. Taking along
an interpreter to fight the language
barrier, I spoke with the local color
on Lexington High School’s foot-
ball fortunes, and the consensus is
the Scarlet Hurricane just don’t
have the horses this year. In an
exciting ball game last week, Robert
E. Lee of Staunton took advantage
of a few breaks to squeak by our
heroes, 81-0. Coupling the psycholog-
ical effect of last week with Coach
Brewbaker’s exile in Zelda’s, we
have to lean toward Halifax High
in this weekend’s encounter.

VMI is hoping for a little of their
early season luck against Virginia
Saturday. In the George Washing-
ton game, a VMI pass hit the in-
tended end’s back, bounced off a

 

George Washington defender, hit
another GW player, and finally was
grabbed by a Keydet in the end
zone to put a big six on the score-
board. Sounds a little like the AFL.

It’s time again, fans—here is to-
day’s two question “quickie”:

(1) Identify the following with the
sport which has made them notorious
or famous, or both

a. “Wrong Way” Reigals, b. Ralph
Branca, c. Bob McHenry, d. Al Rol-
lins, e. Bill Spivey, f. “Buzz’ Mc-
Bride.

1. baseball, 2. basketball, 3. golf,
4. lacrosse, 5. hockey, 6. football.

(2) Match the nicknames with
the famous sports figures:

a.“Battlin’ Bob,” b. “Jolly Ollie,” c.
Rabbit (“Bunny”), d. “Tricky Dick,”
e. “Easy Ed.”

THE GENERAL

>

 
   

The freshman soccer team scored
three quick goals in the early stages
of the first quarter and used this
cushion to coast to a 5-2 victory
over Augusta Military Academy to
even its record of 1-1.

In the first game they were de-
feated by the Lynchburg J.V. by
a score of 2-1, as the center forward
Jim Cogar scored the only goal
for W&L. As the opposition sub-
stituted frequently members of the
varsity soccer team, the close de-
feat was considered a bright view

of things to come. Still coach Bob
Lathrop saw the need for improve-
ment in defense and passing offense.

“We're going to have a good sea-
son...tremendous ability when we
get our passing game down and our
defensive responsibilities mastered,”
coach Lathrop commented. “We def-
initely see a much better than
break-even season. We've got five or
six guys that'll certainly play varsity
ball next year. They’ve got the abil-
ity—just lack experience in college
competition.”

A good team effort sparked the
5-2 vietory. An effective offense and
a stubborn defense kept the visitors
bottled up in their own half most of

the game as the W&L offense move-
ment predominated. The first score
came in the opening minutes of the
first quarter as John Lambeer kick-
ed a corner kick to Jim Cogar who
headed it in for a 1-0 lead. Moments
later a long pass from mid-field to
Cogar again set up the score as the

Keep The Ball Rolling

Last Saturday at the W&L-Oberlin game the student body
did something that a student body at Washington and Lee
hasn’t done since the days that Gil Bocetti carried the pig-
skin for the Generals—they actually cheered in an organized
manner. School spirit may be a trite subject but it is one that
deserves attention. I have often times heard some ‘‘mature”
upperclassmen state that he “‘didn’t really care if everyone
yelled or not—we keep on winning so it really doesn’t matter,
besides I’m going to Roanoke to watch a real football team
play.” By this “real” football team I suppose he meant our
big brother to the north—UVa.

Just what makes a “real’’ football team? A 250-pound
tackle from the Pennsylvania coal mines who claims he likes
the aspect of body contact with a 145-pound halfback? Or
perhaps a 210-pound fullback who has the facial characteris-
tics of the missing link? These individuals certainly may add
to the color of a team but do they add anything to the school
of which they are a part? If the school is football-minded then
they do.

Let us look at Washington and Lee. We (ever since 1954)
are basically not a football-minded school although some of
our opponents seem to think so. W&L is the ‘“‘gentleman’s
school of the South” (if I may use the term). We play a
gentleman’s brand of football. We have no ‘‘mooses’’’ we
have no “animals,”’ just plain football players. If we played
in a different league maybe we would have these individuals,
but the fact remains that we don’t engage in this manly sport
with teams such as Alabama, Georgia Tech, etc. We play in
our own, sedate, insignificant College Athletic Conference and,
gentlemen, are tops in this conference.

Everyone realizes that it would be much more interesting
to cheer for a team that is nationally recognized. What a lot
of people don’t realize is that W&L is nationally recognized—
in its own way. Face it—we are a small college and we don’t
field teams that could beat USC 37-0 or Alabama 21-0. I’m
not saying that this is our fate, accept it, and live with it. What
I’m saying is that we owe it our team to give them some de-

sparky center forward upset the
goalie in running the score to 2-0.
Before the quarter had ended, Cogar
made it 3-0 by heading in a Brad
Shinkle corner-kick pass.

After about three minutes in the
second period Skeet Krumperman
put the ball in play with a down-
field pass which, seconds later gave
Cogar his forth goal of the day.

About midway through the third
quarter Watkins smashed a pass
from Pete Heumann through the
goalie to make the score 5-0. The
game remained as such until the
closing minutes of the game when
a ball went up in the air near the
W&L goal. Coming down it was de-
flected off the head of one of the
defenders and sailed untouched into
the net for the visitors’ first score
of the lay. Seconds later A.M.A.
tallied on their own as goalie Ward
Briggs dove for a squibbling ball.
