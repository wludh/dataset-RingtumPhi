Six Nominating Speakers

For Republican Candidates

The Steering Committee for the
Republican Mock Convention decid-
ed late last week on the nominat-
ing speakers for the six leading
presidential candidates. The speak-
ers were chosen on a basis of proven
ability in oratory and on their af-
finities for the candidates. The
speakers are Sandy Walton for
Governor Rockefeller, Mike Hays-
lip for Senator Goldwater, Jay
Clark for Ambassador Lodge, Bill
Noell for Mr. Nixon, Tom Budd for
Governor Scranton, and George
Craddock for Senator Smith.

In choosing the states from which
these nominations will come, every
attempt was made to conform to
what should actually be the case in
San Francisco this summer. As
Wyatt Durette, Chairman of the
tepublican Party, pointed out, how-
ever, the picture may easily change.
These selections though are hardly
essential to the success of the con-
vention. As it stands now the states
which will give the nominations are

Delaware for Rockefeller, Illinois
for Goldwater, New Hampshire for
Lodge, North Dakota for Nixon,
Pennsylvania for Seranton, and
Maine for Smith. The first three
states were chosen on the basis of
the primaries held there. Scranton

will be nominated by his home state,
because he is technically a favorite
son. The same true for Smith
in Maine. Nixon will be nominated
from North Dakota because of his
pledged support there.

Five Minute Speeches

All of these candidates except
Smith will be allowed five minutes
for the nomination and two minutes
for the second. Smith will only be
allowed three minutes for the nom-
ination, because she is not considered
to be a major candidate. In addition
to these speeches there will be
eight favorite son nominations of
two minutes each.

Sandy Walton, who will deliver
Rockefeller’s nominating speech, is
an intermediate law student and
member of Phi Gam social fraternity.
Last spring he finished among the
top three in oral argument compe-
tition in the law school and is a
member of the Moot Court Team.

‘Androcles’ Premieres Tomorrow
As Final Troubadour Production

The Troubadour Theatre of Wash-
ington and Lee is producing, as its
final play of the 1963-64 season,
Androcles and the Lion, a comedy
by George Bearnard Shaw.

Androcles is a reworking of the
famous legend about an animal-lov-
ing Christian, Androcles, who en-
counters a lame lion and soothes his
discomfort by removing a_ large
thorn from the besast’s paw. Later,
when Androcles is to be thrown to
the lions with a number of other
Christian martyrs, this prior kind-

ness is to have astonishing re-
sults.
The comedy of this famous

Shavian play derices itself from
two sources. The first is Shaw’s
inevitable wit which voices itself
in dialogue between the major
character, notably Androcles, Le-
vinia, a female Christian prisoner,
another brawny Christian named
Ferovius, the Captain, and the
Emperor. The second source of
comedy finds its strength in the
large amount of farce business
which Shaw manages superbly.
The scenes with the lion, por-
trayed in full lion costume, lead
to moments of sheer hilarity, as
does the spectacle of the Emperor
of Rome jumping up and down
and dancing with glee.

Couched among the light, humor-
ous moments of the play is a serious
discussion, fostered by Shaw, of the
myths and facts of Christianity. The
audience will find how quickly the
playwright can turn a moment of
levity suddenly into a serious philo-
sophical discussion in which he dis-
counts myths of Christianity and
makes us all aware of the reality and
strength of Faith. In such a way
this play is instructive in its con-
tent, yet humorous in its delightful
presentation.

Contributing significantly to the
humor of this production is the
set design, Executed by a student,
Gay Reading, working with Dr.
Jones and Dr, Junkin, the set con-
sists of several outlandish pieces,
including a vividly painted jungle
scene which features “drunken”
columns, which make up in novel-
ty what they lack in architectural
soundness. Reading is the first stu-
dent to design a set for the Troubs
in four years,

Androcles and the Lion will be
given at the Troubadour Theatre,
Wednesday through Saturday nights
with curtain time at 8:15 p.m. All
seats may be reserved by calling
HObart 3-2181, ext. 273, any after-
noon this week.

Speaking to an audience largely
composed of Goldwater supporters
Friday night, Judge John Lomenzo,
Secretary of State for New York,
expounded on the attributes of pres-
idential candidate Nelson Roske-
feller.

He opened his talk with a survey
of the paramount problem of our
country: the question of survival—
especially since only 30 minutes
are now necessary to alter civiliza-
tion through nuclear bombs, the
question of foreign policy, and the
passive attitude of American voters.

To these dilemmas he added an-
other: domestic problems, Having
been a judge in New York State
for eight years, he vividly pic-
tured how a youth in New York
could “borrow” an unsuspecting
person's car for a “joy ride,” be
convicted of a felony, and then be
unable, years later, to vote, hold a
civil service position, and prebably
be accepted by a college. He cited
unemployment as another chal-
lenge.

It was Lomenzo’s contention
Rockefeller is the candidate who is
the most to satisfy these na-
tional dilemmas. Pointing to Rocke-
feller an individual, he pointed
out that Rocky was introduced into
the Federal Government at the age
of 32, and quickly rose in powel
and position. He became the Assist-
ant Secretary State South

at San Francisco, where he fought
for and received the right of indi-

curity pacts outside of the UN. This
right opened the way for NATO,
SEATO, and other pacts.

Under the Eisenhower govern-
ment, Rockefeller drew the blue-
prints for the Health, Education,
and Welfare Department, and de-
veloped the “Open Skies” policy.
in 1958 he defeated the incumbent
for the New York Governorship
by the largest plurality recorded
in that state.

Referring to Rockefeller’s politi-
cal beliefs, Lomenzo emphasized
Rocky’s dedication to the individu-

obligations, whereas the unemployed

IFC Passes
New System
For Rushing

The Interfraternity Council last
night passed several changes in the
rush system. The most radical
change deals with a new system of
Open Houses which will replace the
initial rush in the dorms. These
Open Houses will take place during
the first two days for formal rush,
Thursday and Friday, from 7 p.m.
to 11 p.m. There will be six of these
Open House each night, each one
forty minutes long, during the first
two nights, and there will be three
more Open Houses Monday after-
noon.

Rushees Must See 10 Houses

The freshmen will be required to
see at least ten houses during the
first two nights and will not be al-
lowed to see any house more than
once. There will be no more than
thirty rushees present at any house,
and each fraternity will be given a
list of the Freshmen who will be

%*a Siegert Scholarship, and has been

| active on the Liberty Hall Com-

| mittee,

 

present at each open house at least
an hour before the beginning of |
that open house. During the open)
houses no beer can be served or
consumed.

For the open houses eight frater-
nities will be allowed to use a maxi-
mum of ten cars each. Those eight
are Phi Kappa Psi, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Zeta Beta Tau, Pi Kappa
Phi, Lambda Chi, Phi Epsilon Pi,
Delta Upsilon, and Kappa Sigma.
Only one fraternity man will be
allowed in each car. Those frater-
nities not allowed cars will be al-
lowed no more than ten members
to walk the rushees to and from
their respective houses.

Limited Dorm Rush

There will be limited dorm rush
for one hour on the Saturday and
Monday of Rush Week. However,
only four members from each fra-
ternity will be allowed to enter the
dorms at this time.

With the addition of the Open
Houses Rush Week will be one day
longer next year, beginning on
Thursday and ending on Wednesday.

Convention Steering Committee. Mc-
Dowell is chairman of the Pennsyl-
vania delegation, Scranten’s home
state.

McDowell commented
Peet’s talk here, “Since Scranton is

Thirteenth Mock Convention
Could Be The Last One At W&L

John Madison’s speech before the student body last week
was a fresh interval in the dry run of compulsory student as-
semblies. Naturally Madison’s humor was appreciated and it
was taken lightly—but perhaps much too lightly.

The subject of Madison’s speech was hardly a joke,
although he spoke humorously to try to get away from a
“preaching” tone. His request that students restrain their con-
duct during the 1964 Mock Convention must not be laughed
off. Unless the student body does behave accordingly during
the convention, it will disappear in the future. This will be
the thirteenth and last Mock Convention.

The consequences for the individual student who indulges
in misconduct also will be serious. The Student Control Com-
mittee will be alert to any misbehavior during the convention,
and will judge all cases with due severity. What the town of
Lexington will do with any students it can apprehend goes

without saying.

Madison felt he could use humor in his speech because
he has a good deal of faith in the maturity of the student body.
We should all make an effort to vindicate that confidence next

week.

Steering Committee Poll

Possible Switch To Nixon
Forseen In Second Ballot

Washington and Lee University’s Mock Republican Convention
is receiving a 50 per cent return on its poll of the Republican county
chairmen in almost every county in the United States.

Nixon Gains Support

Results of the poll will not be revealed, but Philip D. Sharp, Jr.,
Chairman of the Mock Convention’s Steering Committee, is willing
to discuss the trends he has noticed as the questionnaires pour in.
Sharp says that “probably the most significant factor” in the returns
to date, is a “notable switch to Nixon on the second ballot.”

The poll asks two questions. The first is, “In your opinion, for
which candidate will your state’s delegation cast its vote on the

first ballot?” The second query
switching on the second ballot.

asks for indications of possible

The mock convention questionnaries, which were sent to the
Republican leaders in every state except Arizona and Texas, are
being returned to Lexington as many as 200 a day, and returns from
the Western states, which were sent out first, have reached about

50 per cent.

Returns High In ‘Questionable’ States
Sharp, pointing out the usefulness of the poll in insuring the
accuracy of the Mock Convention’s prediction of the next Republican
presidential nominee, says that returns are very high in some states
which are “questionable.” From Iowa, for example, 52 of the 89
chairmen had replied by today; and from Kansas, 54 out of 103

had answered.

Overall returns, said Sharp, have passed 1,400, and the replies
are still coming in. He commented that this is a very favorable
average, in light of the fact that the Gallup Poll in a recent samp-
ling of the county chairmen, received only a 60 per cent return
after asking one easily answered question.

The poll is expected to attract much publicity to the Mock Con-
vention, and much attention from Republican politicians who are
already familiar with the convention.

New James Bond Flick Gets A ‘C’
Story And Acting Called Mediocre

By JAMES JENNINGS

All good movies that have come
or are coming soon have been re-
viewed so I will offer a second-
rate review on a second-rate movie
based on a second-rate novel.

James Bond, the stud with gun-
metal lighter and more broads than
most men can dream about, returns
to the screen in From Russia with
Love. As in all of Ian Fleming's
stories, Bond almost gets killed sev-
eral times, gets outsmarted every
time except the one time that counts,
and gets the girl.

Bond, (Sean Connery, again) goes
to Turkey to make a deal with a
blonde who is passing herself off as
a decoding secretary who has run
away with the top secret decoding
machine. She wants to trade it for
Bond and the super stud is ready
to risk anything for England and
the lady. He deliberately walks into
the trap set up by SPECTRA de-
signed to embarrass England and her
secret service by catching 007 in
an intimate relationship with a Rus-
sian spy (Daniela Bianchi).

Toasted Baloney

From the time James meets the
blonde to the end of the movie the
screen resembles a toasted baloney
sandwich. The music is good, Bond
is tweedy, and the girls are good
looking, but the story and the act-
ing are as mediocre as would be
expected from a mystery story in-
volving a dumb cop knocking heads
with the brains of Russia.

Bond works his way ‘through
gypsy camps, the Turkish under-
ground, and half of the women in

 

Istanbul. He ends up on a slow
train through Europe fighting, drink-
ing and enjoying all the other
studly activities that are publish-
able. As soon as he meets a man he
can really like and respect the guy
gets killed so Bond can stay in love
with himself,

A Modern Clark Kent

The undergraduate has found a
new hero in James Bond. Steve Mc-
Queen has parked his motorcycle
outside Macy’s, Charles Bronson has
gone back to the reservation, but
James Bond is just starting to
move. We drove to Roanoke to see
Dr. No and stayed up late at nights
last summer to get all of the James
Bond novels read. 007 is a stud and
is possibly worthy of some hero
worship, but From Russia with Leve
is pure baloney. While watching
Bond manipulate women and stalk
the enemies of England, one is re-
minded of a mild-mannered Clark
Kent.

The movie is somewhat enjoyable
because Bond is a stud and some
of his lines and actions would be
considered cool. Hugh Heffner says
it is a great improvement over Dr.
No and I guess it is. It stands as
proof you can only do so much
with a second-rate novel. It is not
a bad way to spend two hours on
a rainy afternoon so it gets a C.

Tom Jones comes to the State
tomorrow and has already been re-
viewed so I will not add anything
trite that might be said about a
great and funny movie, except that
it stands as proof of what can be
done with a stud and a first-rate

By LAMAR LAMB

It is always dangerous for a can-
didate to play political analyst. It
is no less dangerous to talk about
trends shown in one election while
another election is in progress. But
I want to discuss some of the trends
which were manifest in the last
election. The Big
Four election is
much __ different
| from class elec-
tions and really
tthe one has very
little to do with
the other, so may-
be it is worth
venturing out on
a limb.

In the first
place, Ken Lane
and Rod Cock-
shutt were right. Both parties con-
ducted a rather meaningless, or at
least issueless campaign. One would
expect that at Washington and Lee
such would almost always be the
case. Our student body is small and
homogenious; there will rarely be
any significant disagreement about
anything in the student govern-
ment,

As both platforms (and, indeed,
all platforms in recent years) point-
ed out, everyone believes in assimi-
lation committees, honor systems,
traditions, and just about anything
else that offends no one. People
who don’t believe in those things are
driven out by their freshman year.
That, or they are forced into a
cynical and desperate withdrawal
from campus life by an oppressive
and omnipotent atmosphere of “sta-
bility” that pervades Washington
and Lee.

In the second place, Drew Baur

Pace Publishes
Party Statement
From Minority

“T hope that in a few paragraphs
I ean elucidate some points that
need clarification. The Progressive
Party understands the position it is
in. Judging from the recent Student
Body elections, it appears that an
unusually large number of votes
were cast without regard to the
merits of the individual candidates.
Because of this many in our party
seriously considered not nominating
a slate of candidates. Many felt
that refusal to do so might help to
make the student body re-examine
the present political situation, and
ultimately to cause a more equitable
political system.

“However, many persons, people
not only in our party but also peo-
ple in the other party and people
without party affiliation, felt that
this would be unfair to too many
deserving students who would re-
ceive no consideration from the other
party. Our minds were not made up,
however, until we saw the Universi-
ty Party clique’s slate, which was, we
felt, filled with weak and unquali-
fied candidates.

“It is our belief that most stu-
dents will be dissatisfied with the
other party’s candidates. It is our
hope that they will express their
disappointment by voting for those
persons better qualified for the
many positions. If, however, the
weaker candidates are elected, the
result can only be slates of simi-
lar quality in the future.

We only ask that the students
carefully study the nominees’ abili-
ty and experience and vote accord-
ingly, with less emphasis on party
affiliation. We would like to com-
mend the University clique’s efforts
to nominate, appease, and maintain a
surface party unity. We question
whether the sacrifices were worth
this effort.”

Earl Mack’s Candidacy

This year has seen more than one
innovation in campus politics, but
perhaps nothing stranger than the
candidacy of “Earl Mack” for sen-
ior class secretary. Actually, as both
cliques have learned to their relief,
there is no such person, despite a
blanket of posters around campus
to the contrary.

“Earl Mack” is in reality an alias
for one of the party candidates, Earl
Madgdovitz. Magdovitz was shorten-
ed Mack on his posters when a lo-
cal printer decided that he was un-
able to print such a long name on a
short piece of paper.

Since Earl Mack will not be nom-
inated by a party there apparently
will be no opportunity to vote for
a real nobody this time. Too bad,
he might have won, as the only can-

 

novel,

didate without any enemies.

too is right. Washington and Lee is
basically a conservative school, sat-
isfied and stable. Perhaps this is
best indicated by the fact that three
of the last four Student Body Pres-
idents have been law students. All
three law students have won by
sizable margins, and that has not
always been attributable to party
majorities. In the last four years, an
undergraduate has never beaten a
law student for President of the
Student Body. The reasons, I sup-
pose, are the predilection for “sta-
bility,” and perhaps a certain desire
for distance and permanancy (father
image, for Freudians).

So what sent the top three
Progressive Party candidates into
a rout like bleating lambs? There
was a big efficient party organi-
zation working against them, They
were unable to form any issues

 

which would cause enough en-
thusiasm to overcome party loyal-
ties. In only one office, that of
President, was it a question of a
liberal vs. a conservative. In fact,
on the whole, the Progressive
Party's candidates (ironically)
were the more conservative,

Then there was the Law School. It
did what it was supposed to do. It
came to the polls; it voted for its
candidate and his slate. The non-
fraternity students weren’t organ-
ized. They split in their own or-
ganization; they split their votes. In
other words, independent students
proved themselves to be just that.

The campaign, then, was char-
acterized by candidates trying hard
to be non-entities. The only issues
were those drummed up by whispers
on both sides, and those issues
were as meaningless as they were

 

 

 

Letters To The Editor ...

 

 

Dear Editor:

The Washington and Lee student
body is a very unusual group, if
we are to believe what we hear
about other colleges. What is so
unusual here is the remarkable po-
litical and social placidity of the
students. The turmoil of the outside
world seems to be well reflected at
most other schools. At Harvard pop-
ular integration societies are raised
and swamp the South with “Free-
dom Riders.” Last year the Prince-
ton student body, apparently smitten
with spring fever, rose as one and
sacked dorms, wrecked automobiles,
fired railroad tracks, and _ battled
with the desperate police. At South
American institutions, attempted as-
sinations of student leaders are not
unknown.

What is being suggested, however,
is not that we turn into junior
demogogues, raze Lexington to the
ground (as tempting as that might
seem), or liquidate Jim Kulp. Rath-
er, one might question the almost
total failure of this student body
to concern itself with anything at
all. Occasionally, an editorial battle
is waged between the two editions
of the Ring-tum Phi, but the ordi-
nary student is seemingly oblivious
to all controversy.

This fact was well demonstrat-
ed in the recent student body
elections in which both parties ran
on platforms of meaningless am-
biguities. Considering the lack of
issues, it is hardly surprising that
there was a strict party vote—with
the predictable results.

This delimma of apathy is cer-
tainly not due to a lack of import-
ant issues at hand. Proposals to in-

the impregnable stone wall of stu-
dent indifference.

What are the reasons for our extra
ordinary inertness? Doubtless, one
is the structure of our student gov-
ernment. As an absolute and semi-
permanent body, the Executive
Committee is under no compunction
to act on any new issues. Indeed,
it is often unaware of their existence.
The trouble here is that the stu-
dents simply lack the machinery to
express their ideas, without a dis-
couraging mass of complications and
effort.

Clique System

Our clique system is also squelch-
ing to new ideas. Understandably,
the cliques try to nominate candi-
dates who will offend no one. These
candidates make further exertions
in that direction. Futhermore, most
students are hesitant to speak out
about touchy issues for fear of
damaging their chances in clique
meeting or of attaching some stigma
to their fraternities.

Finally, is there the possibility
that the students here are just na-
turally different...?

A new set of elections is coming
up soon. Here is another chance
for the candidates to take a chance
and be positive, for once. Here is
also is a chance for minority can-
didates to cut down opponents’
majorities by confronting pleasant
personalities with pertinent issues
(and majority candidates to de-
fend themselves by the same
method.)

Change for the sake of change is
a great evil—but fanatical, unreason-
ing adherence to the status quo is no
less an evil. Let us think about the
issues that have been brought up,
and if they are worthwhile improve-
ments, let us bring them forward
for a vote. Washington and Lee des-
perately needs active, useful, and
meaningful election campaigning.

WARREN MONTGOMERY

 

(Below are statements from EC
candidates for the Progressive Par-
ty, which were announced today
on the front page of this paper.)

Lamar Lamb: “I think that my
experience on the EC is an im-
portant factor in this election. Next
year I will be the only person in
school who will have been on the
EC for two years. It is important to
have a good understanding of what
has been done in previous years.
Only I will be able to provide in-
formation about the EC from earlier
years.”

Rick Carrell: “I believe that each
candidate for Executive Committee
membership should possess the fol-
lowing qualifications; He must be
able to think deeply and be willing
at all times to consider the ideas
of others. He must be readily ac-
cessible to every student and must
diligently seek student opinion. He
must have demonstrated his deter-
mination and leadership through his
scholarship and extracurricular ac-
tivities. Finally, he must always be
willing to accept final responsibili-
ty for his decisions. I feel that I
meet these qualifications and I want
to assume the responsibility of rep-
resenting the rising Senior Class as
Executive Committeeman.”

Chuck Walker: “In returning for
the Executive Committee from the

 

 

Progressive Party Nominees
Issue Campaign Statements

Junior Class, I am interested in
maintaining the structural composi-
tion of the Honor System, in ad-
ministering the spirit rather than
the letter of our Honor Code, in
an increased emphasis on a proper
assimilation program to include both
the traditions of our University, and
orientations of the incoming fresh-
men, and in more effective commun-
ications between the student body
and the Executive Committee.

“Having served on the Executive
Committee for a year, I know that
these programs are capable of ef-
fective implementation and I will,
accordingly, work toward the ac-
complishment of these ends.”

Fred Mindel: “My whole campaign
is based on myself as an individual.
I am attempting to see very mem-
ber of the rising junior class in
order that he might get to know me
as an individual and decide his vote
on that basis alone. This is defi-
nitely not an election where any
other factor should be taken into
consideration.”

Kirk Folle: “It is my utmost de-
sire to serve the sophomore class
as Executive Committeeman. In or-
der to represent the class effectively
I will attempt to see as many stu-
dents as possible and will consider
all suggestions relevant to the work
of the EC.”

 

Shortage Of Campaign Issues Is Reflection
Of Students’ Conservatism, Self-Satisfaction

false.

Perhaps the most significant
thing about the election was
something that it symbolically

pointed out. There was not one
candidate for the Big Four who
was an SAE, Beta, Phi Delt, KA,
or ZBT. Both candidates for Pres-
ident were nonfraternity men.

The trend, long recognized as
coming, finally reached its culmina-
tion. No longer will a few houses
control the campus, if, indeed, they
ever did, And, rightly or wrongly,
nonfraternity men and law students
will have to be considered from now
on when candidates are chosen.

So Washington and Lee chose its
student leadership. It is assured that
W&L will continue much as it has
before. Perhaps because the student
is basically sound, perhaps because
the students (including the candi-
dates) resist change, Washington and
Lee will be roughly the same next
year,

And because there will be no
change, next year’s candidates will
deplore the isolation of the EC, will
suggest Mock Honor trials, will
favor the Assimilation Committee
with possible changes in the imple-
mentation of the rules, and will act
as if it will make all the difference
in the world whether or not they
are elected.

 

Reform Party
Runs Two Men

Entering campus politics for the
second time this year, the Reform
Party, has nominated two candi-
dates for office in the upeoming
election,

Roger Sennott, an Independent, is
running for the junior EC post and
Roper Vaughan, a Phi Delt, has been
placed in the running for the Sec-
retary of the sophomore class.

The purpose of the Reform Par-
ty is to place in office individuals
who are best qualified to handle
the duties of the post. These candi-
dates are chosen on the basis of
their ability and not according to
fraternity or party affiliation. Al-
though this is only the beginning
of the movement, it is hoped that
through its ability to nominate the
best candidates, and not the most
politically advantageous, it will
eventually force the downfall of the
present clique system.

New Coach Will

Teach Tennis

Former Groveton Mentor
Called, by Twardy, Tough

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team is the proud possessor of
a new coach. He is Verne Canfield,
the 3l-year-old coach of Grove-
ton High School in Fairfax, Vir-
ginia. The announcement of his ap-
pointment was made Saturday by
the W&L Athletic Department.

Canfield replaces Bob McHenry,
who is moving to Lebanon Valley.
Canfield will also assume the posi-
tion of coach of the tennis team.

Jeff Twardy, one of two freshmen
to make the W&L varsity basketball
team ‘this season, played against
Canfield’s team for three years when
Twardy attended Annandale High
School, an arch rival of Groveton’s
in the tough Northern Virginia
League. Twardy had nothing but
compliments for the new coach.

Players’ Feelings

“In my three years of varsity ball
at Annadale we never beat Grove-
ton,” commented Twardy. “We had
better teams, but the Tigers always
beat us.” Twardy said that he was
impressed by Canfield’s ability to
get his team up for each game.
Also his team always seemed well
drilled and ran good patterns ac-
cording to Twardy.

Canfield never had a losing sea-
son at Groveton and always won
at least ten games. He stresses speed
and will provide his men _ with
plenty of running in order to get
them in condition. In high school
he generally used a man-to-man de-
fense, was willing to switch to a
match-up zone when tthe situation
called for it.

Canfield was also the coach this
season of one of the hottest college
prospects in the country in the per-
son of Jimmy Lewis, who recently
became the first Negro to accept
a basketball scholarship at West
Virginia .

It is likely that with Canfield asf

coach the Generals’ fans will see
a new style of basketball in Lex-
ington. The Generals will probably

be a running ‘team as opposed to},

recent years of slowdown tactics.

W&L Lacrosse ‘*B’”? Team
Loses To Woodberry, 4-2’
To Play Virginia Frosh

The Washington and Lee lacrosse
“B” team was defeated 4-2, by a
more experienced Woodbury Forest
club, Friday on the losers’ field.

This brings the Baby Generals
record to an even 1-1 with two
games remaining. The Virginia frosh
lacrosse team will be in Lexington
Thursday to oppose the W&L stick-
men, and the following Wednesday
the General “B” squad will travel
to Augusta to play.

Against Woodbury, Jack Hopkins
and David Tappan scored the lone
goals for Washington and Lee, while
the coaches were also impressed by
W&L’s goalie, Skip Brooks, as he
made 12 saves during the game.

mented, “We could have won, if. ..

Tennis Team Downs
Bridgewater, 9-0 To Make
Record 10-2; Meet G.W.

By LARRY CRAIG
Tuesday Sports Writer
Substituting three entirely new
players into its starting six, the
Washington and Lee tennis team
still managed to walk away with
Bridgewater, 9-0, Friday for its

tenth victory in twelve starts.
Drew Baur, Fred Taussig and Bill
Washburn, Jr., augmented the reg-
lar General courtsters and proved
their capabilities by easily handling
their Eagle opponents. Jim DeYoung,
Jim Mell and Lindsey Short, all
regular General tennis starters, had
even less trouble with their rivals
as Mell and Short shut out their
men and De Young won 6-2,6-1.

Golfers Finish
Third In State

Battling the weather as well as
all of the top golf teams in the
state, Washington and Lee’s links-
ters faired rather well yesterday as
they waded to a third place tie
in the Virginia Intercollegiate Tour-
nament held this weekend at the
Homestead.

Ed Crosland found the wet course
to his liking and responded with
a torrid 158 for two rounds (84 and
74) to capture overall individual
second place for the Generals. Cros-
land was right behind the medalist
from VPI George Cochran who shot
the leading score of 155 (75 and
80).

Virginia Tech took home the
team first place edging the Univer-
sity of Virginia by ten points with
a total score of 650. W&L and
Lynchburg tied for third place, both
shooting a team total of 670. The
Generals were fairly pleased with
their showing on the soggy course,
but are now in the process of get-
ting “Teed up” for the CAC tourney
in two weeks.

Michaeles Praised

Michaeles failed to score in Sat-
urday’s contest but was cited by
Coach McHenry for his excellent
team play as he assisted in four
scoring plays. Randy Wootton and
Doug Morrison both added two tal-
lies to W&L’s totals. Co-captain
Syd Butler, freshman Bob Frost and
Pat Robertson all added to the
Generals’ early deluge. Robertson
was praised for gobbling up 7
ground balls during the game, while
McDaniel also earned plaudits by
picking up 10 loose grounders.

The coaches were also pleased
with defenseman Lance Bendann’s
play. This freshman had the task
of guarding UNC’s vaunted Jeff

prior to the CAC tournament.
W&L has begun to collect more
hits as the rise in the team batting
average from .172 for just after the
Spring Vacation trip to .205 now in-
dicates. Dave Kirkpatrick with a
223 batting average, Ashley Allen
with .300 and co-captain Lou Flana-
gan with .300 lead the Generals’ at-
tack.

However, Washington and Lee con-

tinues to commit errors at the same
rate as they did early in the season.
Most of these errors are now of the
throwing variety; the fielding mis-
takes account for very few. Main-
ly the errors continue to come in
the early innings.
In the pitching department, the
problem is issuing a free pass to
the first batter in many innings
who has eventually scored 95 per
cent of the time. However, co-
captain Brice Gamber, southpaw
Chris Wigert and rightie Pete Heu-
manns are sound physically and
need only some good fielding sup-
port and a little batting to give them
the confidence a pitcher needs to be
effective.

Smokey says to color the sky — blue; the sun — yellow; his hat
—olive; his pants—blue; his shovel — gray; the tree trunks—
light brown; the trees and grass —light and dark greens and color Smokey — tan.

ashes and then drown with water again?’
