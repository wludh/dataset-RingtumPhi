H.M.A. Leads New Probe
Of Current Combo Prices

By STIRLING LATHROP

The House Managers’ Association
has begun an inquiry into the com-
parative prices of combos hired at
W&L as opposed to the prices the
same bands charge at other nearby
schools. This investigation is part of
a general strengthening of the As-
sociation’s current functions and an
enlarging of its responsibility.

Hansley Fills
Info Position

Gene B. Hansley of Altavista, Va.,
has been named assistant director of
information services for the Univer-
sity.

Hansley, 27, will assume his new
duties Dec. 26, succeeding A. Pres-
cott Rowe who resigned to take a
public relations position with the
Reynolds Metals Company of Rich-
mond.

Hansley was formerly employed
by the Lynchburg News where for
two years he was religious editor
and feature editor. Previously he
worked three years as an advertis-
ing copywriter in the advertising
department of the publishing agen-
cy of the Southern Baptist Conven-
tion in Nashville, Tenn.

Hansley is a 1956 B.A. graduate of
the University of Richmond. He also
has studied public relations at the
University of Tennessee’s Nashville
Extension, and he has studied at the
University of North Carolina sum-
mer session.

His Washington and Lee work will
involve him in general public re-
lations, with emphasis on relations
between the university and repre-
sentatives of the press, radio, and
television media.

 

 

Jim Slay, president of the Asso-
ciation, said that there has long
been a belief that W&L is being
unaccountably overcharged by some
of the combos which play here for
fraternity parties. A committee has
been formed to inquire about combo
prices at other schools, giving due
consideration for traveling expenses
which would alleviate the price of
any combo somewhat.

Schools Being Contacted

Numerous schools are being con-
tacted in this survey. Some are the
University of North Carolina, the
University of Virginia, the Univer-
sity of Richmond. If the findings
show that W&L is being over-
charged, the committee will recom-
mend a solution. Student recommen-
dations will be invited.

The project of regulation of com-
bo prices has formerly been one of
the tasks of the Executive Commit-
tee. When the committee reported
that it did not have time to con-
sider the matter, it was turned over
to the House Managers’ Association.
This current study is actually the
first serious study of the problem to
date.

Employment Roster

Another matter which the H.M.A.
is handling is fraternity house hired
help. Duke Terrell and Doug
Hagestad, vice president and secre-
tary respectively, have established
a file committee which will set up
an employment roster. The commit-
tee will contact, interview, and
screen the help which is available
in the area. Then a list will be
compiled and referred to each fra-
ternity house. According to Slay, it
will not be a “black list,” but merely
a means of facilitating the hiring of
help when it is needed.

Politics ----‘Buttons And Baloney’

 

Dr. Leyburn Accompanist

 

WREL Slates Taped Concert

Radio Washington and Lee will
present an hour-long program of
taped music at 8 p.m. Thursday,
preceding the University Christ-
mas service.

The program, first of its kind for
Radio Washington and Lee, consists
of a balanced hour of songs sung by
W&L baritone John Baker and Mrs.
Delores Jones, local mezzo-soprano.
Baker and Mrs. Jones are accom-
panied by Dr. James G. Leyburn,
head of W&L’s sociology department,
and an accomplished pianist.

Baker, an SAE senior from Suf-
folk, Va. has been singing “for
years” and has been a member of
the Glee Club and Sazeracs while
here.

Mrs. Jones, a_ schoolteacher at
Lylburn Downing, has been trained

in voice, sings in the R. E. Lee
Memorial Episcopal Church choir.
The taped program begins with
three songs by Hugo Wolfe, sung
by Mrs. Jones, three old English
songs and Schubert’s Omnipotence,
by Baker, and a duet from Mozart's
Don Giovanna with both soloists.

Mrs. Jones sings some Christmas
spirituals, and Baker does two sea-
sonal songs. Perhaps the high point
of the recording is the portion the
two soloists sing from Porgy and
Bess; “I got Plenty of Nothing,”
Baker; “Summertime,” Jones; and
“Bess, You Is My Woman Now,”
Jones and Baker.

The project was planned and in-
directly supervised by John K. Jen-
nings for the Department of Jour-
nalism, although program selection
was left entirely to the soloists.
Dr. Leyburn, who worked with the
two from the beginning, is respon-
sible for the musical discipline of
their performances.

Dr. Edward Turner taped the con-
cert in the Lee Chapel with pro-
fessional recording equipment. The
taped concert evoked unusual praise
from both students and faculty.
Bob Mottley, W&L senior and long
a student of “good music,” said that
“Anyone who can appreciate good,
all-round singing must hear this
tape. While Baker and Jones are in-
dividually excellent, they are marve-
lously effective in the duets from
Giovanni and Porgy and Bess.”

Journalism professor Mr. Jennings
said that “Delores Jones singing of
Summertime is beautiful and mov-
ing, and John Baker has one of the
finest non-profession male singing
voices I’ve ever heard.”

 

Grenier Reviews Party Structure
Avoids Topic Of Partisan Issues

By CHARLES NEWMAN
News Editor
Last night in duPont Auditorium John E. Grenier spoke
on the structure of the Republican Party. Grenier, after his
talk, was present at a reception at the Kappa Sigma House,
where partisan subjects were discussed.
Partisan subjects were not a part of his speech due to the

moratorium which has been de-*

clared by the Republican Party in
respect for the late John F. Kennedy.

Grenier opened his talk by stating
that politics are a business and that
it offers vast opportunities for par-
ticipation in political process on all
levels. He stated that there are two
chief aims of political parties: to
present a consensus of the views of
the members of the party and to
nominate a candidate to articulate
their views.

Party Has Short Life

The Republican Party exists only
for three or four days a year ac-
cording to Grenier. This is the time
of the National Convention during
which measures are adopted to con-
trol the Party for the next four
years.

The National Committee is the
group which lays the groundwork
for the Republican Party. This com-
mittee is composed of two represen-
tatives from each of the fifty states—
one man and one woman.

State Level

On the state level there are also
committees. Grenier used Alabama
as an example of the state set up:
in that state each county sends rep-
resentatives who are apportioned
according to the percentage of the
vote in each county cast for the Re-
publican candidate in the last presi-

 

 

dential election. From this conven-
tion a state committee is elected
which oversees the political activities
in the state for the next four years.

Making of a Candidate

Grenier brought out four points
which he felt must be followed to
have a_ successful candidate. The
party must have a good candidate,
issues, organization, and money. The
candidate must be careful not to say
anything that will turn people
against him—candidates lose votes by
saying the wrong things rather than
gain votes by saying the right things.

Button, Balloons, and Baloney

The political organization is guid-
ed by what Grenier calls “buttons,
balloons and baloney.” The organi-
zation has to make people get out to
vote and to vote for their party.
Grenier stated that only 45 per cent
of those who can register do so, and
that only 65 per cent of those that
register vote. He repeatedly empha-
sized the importance of the “block
man” in the political organization—
the man who knocks on doors.

Grenier’s speech was arranged by
the Steering Committee of the 1964
Mock Convention to acquaint stu-
dents with the structure of the Re-
publican Party as a background for
the Mock Convention to be held this
Spring.

‘Absolute Power Corrupts

Absolutely’—But At W&L?

Some people won’t be happy with this editorial. We
aren’t very happy with it ourselves because it implies that
something is wrong with our student government. We
said last Tuesday that we believe a small minority of the
Executive Committee controls our student affairs. The
incidents upon which we based this statement are cited
below. Perhaps they don’t offer real proof; we don’t claim
them as proof. We simply feel they open the door for
doubt as to the quality of our system of government.

Neither of the incidents we shall describe were re-
ported to you, the student. Since both stories would have
affected you had they not been swept under the carpet,
we feel it is not our right to hold back the facts we know.
We do not choose to support one side or the other in
either matter; we do think you have the right to know
when a decision is made in our student government. We
thus offer you the following two incidents, just as they
should have appeared in the page one news columns.

Assimilation Proposal Squelched

At the beginning of this semester, the Assimilation
Committee worked for some time on a proposal which it
felt would improve the belabored conventional dress sit-
uation. The plan: coats and ties would be worn by all
students at least until 10:30 weeknights, and 1 p.m. Sat-
urdays. Dress after these hours would be such “‘as benefits
a gentleman.” When the proposal was taken to the EC,
it was approved by a 7-3 vote. Bill Noell, president, did not
vote. Against the proposal were law students Jim Rowe
and Jim Kulp, and sophomore representative Chuck
Walker.

In the week following this meeting, Jim Maffit, Assi-
milation Committee Chairman, was grilled by several peo-
ple. EC members whose votes had been “‘yes’’ also were
questioned. The newspaper was told to keep the pro-
posal’s acceptance out of print. By the time of the next
EC meeting, seven days later, Mafhit withdrew his commit-
tee’s proposal and the EC’s acceptance of it was “rescind-
ed.” That is one incident.

Forum Constitution Defeated

The Steering Committee of the Leadership Forum,
composed of twelve students, designated by a four-man
subcommittee to draft a constitution for the entire Forum.
This was done, and a meeting of the full committee to
discuss and vote on the constitution was called. The sub-
committee felt that a majority of the members of the full
committee would accept their constitution. Their plan
would, in effect, make the Student Forum (which is com-
posed of the leaders of all campus organizations) into a
legislative body. The Student Forum would have a gen-
uine say in the supervision of student body affairs.

The Thursday-night meeting was suddenly—even
mysteriously called off. At least one of the members of
the committee did not even know it had been postponed.
A meeting was re-called five days later, at which some
members of the full committee talked disparagingly of
the new constitution which had been written. The consti-
tution was defeated by a decivise vote—7 to 4 (one mem-
ber of the committee being absent).

Draw Your Own Conclusions—We Have

You draw your own conclusions about these two
events. Perhaps there is nothing to them. We think there
is. In the first instance, it is obvious that the opinion of a
strong majority of the EC was in favor of the Assimila-
tion Committee’s proposal. The vote was recorded. One
week later the proposal was withdrawn. The issue was
buried. It seems to us that the minority which opposed
the proposal must have exerted some stiff pressure to get
the proposal withdrawn. It was a plan into which the As-
similation Committtee had put a considerable amount of
time and thought. It would seem that the students who
conceived the idea could not be convinced easily that
they were totally wrong—wrong enough to withdraw
their idea from debate.

In the second instance we have a subcommittee which
was writing a constitution. Why should they spend their
time writing one which they felt would not pass the full
Steering Committee, and then the forum itself? Members
of the subcommittee have indicated they believe in their
constitution and felt it would pass. But it did not—indeed,
it was soundly defeated. It was defeated after a sudden,
still unexplained postponement of the meeting at which
the constitution was to be discussed and voted upon.

Persuasive Tactics Used: Right or Wrong?

Was the original meeting postponed to give oppon-
ents of the constitution time to apply pressure in the right
places? Only a few people can be sure—and they cer-
tainly won’t talk. But one of the four students who helped
write the original constitution cast his vote against it at the
re-called meeting. We wonder. ..

Nothing is wrong with the power of legitimate per-
suasion. But it is possible some of the persuasive tactics
used by some of the “‘powers-that-be” in our student gov-
ernment are not so legitimate? We can’t say yes or no.

What do you think?

   
 

Pigeon Feathers and Other Stories.
John Updike, Crest, 1962, 50c.
Before we praise or mutilate Pi-

geon Feathers, as the fancy takes us,

a few words might be said about

such activities in general and this

column in particular.

The idea that I could have any-
thing of worthwhile critical value to
say about this or any other book is
ridiculous. It is simply a game. Not
that my reaction is not valid— it is
at least mine and you are entitled to
one, too; everyone, hopefully, learns
to criticize, to weigh, and repect or
accept.

But literary criticism is a ser-
ious matter and ninety percent of
the people who try it don’t know
what they are talking about. Lit-
erature is the highest product of
an animal who can write, and a
good judge must know a lot more
about life and literature in gener-
al to provide a sound judgment
and an understanding that goes
beyond “liking” and “disliking.”
On this level, as I said, it’s a
game—and as long as we don’t for-
get that, it can be a good one.

Readers who enjoyed Rabbit, Run
could do worse than pursue Updike’s
latest collection of stories. At his
lowest level, he is what is often re-
ferred to as a “craftsman”: that is to
say, he has a good sense of taste and
balance. He is frequently much more
than this.

Most of the stories are concerned
with marriage. Marriage that has
gone stale, not dramatically but
slowly and sickeningly. Updike is
very sensitive to the ways people
in these situations play games and
the ways in which they hurt each
other. The characters live in their
little worlds, unable to break outside
or to establish contact within their
marriage.

this with his wife. Her answer is
final and characteristic: “Eat your
egg.”

This is the same theme that Up-
dike explores more fully in his
novel. I know nothing of Updike’s
personal situation nor do I care
to, for these stories are more than
a personal statement. In a society
that puts less and less emphasis
on family, one might well wonder
what the purpose of marriage is—
especially when it twists people

into the shape of Updike’s char-
acters. Only once do they make it,
in one of the best stories, “Wife-
Wooing.”

The title story is concerned with
a young boy’s initiation into relig-
ious doubt; it is well-done, but too
neatly resolved for my taste. Per-
haps we would rather have our
doubts remain? The stories about
high-school are very fine, the best
I have ever read; Updike’s latest
novel, Centaur, is about high-school
but I haven’t read it.

The stock objection to Updike is
that he is “New Yorker through
and through.” This is true, if it
means anything. This magazine
tends to groom favored writers
and force them into a mold so
that they write only stories that
fit a certain “formula.” Some time
ago this was described as “like
writing for any other magazine
and then cutting off the last two
paragraphs,” This is no longer an
accurate description, but if “fine
writing,” innuendo, and an aware-
ness of America’s hard-to-define-
but-present social structure were
added, it might come close.

What does this mean? I feel that
the New Yorker ruined J. D, Saling-
er. It doesn’t follow that everyone
who writes for this magazine is sup-
erficial and worthless. Shakespeare
wrote for a “formula.” Virgil wrote
for a “formula.” The accusation is
strictly neutral. It is evident that
Updike has something that he wants
to say—the last two stories, written
in a sort of Proustian recherchee
fashion that is pleasantly experi-
mental, point this out to my satisfac-
tion—and there are not enough good
writers around today to toss one out
with such a superficial objection.

‘Certain Topics ... Were Taboo’

The halls were deserted, but under
the sills of various of the cubicles
could be seen a light. Voices could
be heard also, some in monotones,
some very highly pitched—some al-
most a whisper. At the end of the
corridor, where the gate was, stood
a man, tall, well built, very alert.
It was Christmas season.

From the outside, it was a large
solid brick building, recently con-
structed. It had no outstanding fea-
tures, nothing to attract the eye, four
people walking by it always stopped
a minute to look, before they con-
tinued to go about their normal busi-
ness.

It was referred to in two ways.
Those inside spoke of it as “it,” or
“here.” On the outside it was hardly
referred to, or else it was simply
termed “there.”

Certain parts of it had no stranger
appearance than that of a well-kept,

second-class hotel. Downstairs was
partitioned. One half resembled a
large, barren recreation room. In the
center was a library table, covered
with magazines and newspapers.
There were chairs around the table
and situated strategically through-
out the room. The other half of the
downstairs contained equipment.
About thirty people were assembled
in the room, all separate, some talk-
ing, some quiet, none listening.

One sat in a corner, tearing a
newspaper, absently, as though it
had no significance. At the back of
the room a woman recited, in a mon-
otone, the Communist Manifesto, In
the center of the group stood a tall,
skinny boy, gesticulating wildly, who
was shouting his allegiance to the
Nazi party. Two people were seated
in armchairs, facing each other—one
explaining the world situation to the
other—the latter giving a lecture on

advanced physics.

Eleven sat on the floor, silent ex-
cept for an occasional motion.

The second floor, which was a
large gallery circumnavigating the
recreation room, adjoining to a series
of corridors, had chairs permanent-
ly assigned around the gallery, and
in some of these, white coated men
with serious expressions watched the
scenes going on below.

In one of a set of offices on the
top floor, a soft-spoken man listen-
ed to one of the inmates.

Through an open door the voices
of two doctors talked about one of
the schizophrenics.

“If we could only get her to talk—
to express an opinion—about any-
thing.”

At the other end of town—at a
holiday cocktail party, 21 assembled
couples talked cheerfully. Certain
topics, of course, were taboo.

Professor Gives Advice to Freshman Son
On Basic Aspects of Carreer in College

By DR. JOHN ADEN

Advice is something everyone
has, but which few people can give
well. In an open letter to his son
last year, English Professor John
M. Aden gave advice worth the
attention of freshmen and upper-
classmen alike.

Dear Son,

Advice is an incorrigible vice of
parenthood, and you can only take
consolation (or chagrin) in the fact
that you will yourself suecumb to it
in the fullness of time. But let me try
to bring it all together once more—
just once more—and I will promise
to try to do better in the future.

I sent you to the school you are
attending because I thought it
good, because I thought it offered
you the most versitile possibilities
of a rounded education, that I
could ascertain. Whether I mis-
judged must await the test, but
that is what I strove for—a com-
prehensive opportunity for qual-
ity of every kind. What do I
expect of you in return? Nothing,
I hope, that you would not want,
or that it would not profit you, to
give.

Of course I want, and expect, you
to study. I would like to see you
make good grades, the Dean’s List,
Phi Eta Sigma, and eventually Phi

Beta Kappa. This means hitting the
books, with steadiness, purpose, and
resolve. It means doing the “night
work,” preparing the assignments,
boning for the tests, with the min-
imum of beer breaks commensurate
with sanity.

But I hope I have already indi-
cated to you that while old-fash-
ioned, hard study goes a long way
in this business of getting educated,
it by no means achieves that end of
itself merely. Almost anyone who
puts his back into it can become a
bookworm and a blockhead. How to
avoid such doom, without scuttling
study, is what I want to be sure
you understand and act upon.

For one thing, you will not (like
some of your professors, possibly)
mistake your textbook for the uni-
versity. You will study it, but you
will read beyond it—not just “paral-
lel” stuff, but books, good books,
hard books, strange books, big books,
little books, old books, new books.
You will, in short, cut loose in the
stacks (which, don’t forget, are
open) or in some dorm-mate’s book
shelf or some professor’s or chap-
lain’s study, or wherever, and find
something that you want to read, or,
baiting that, just something to read,
something to fill up your still half-
empty head, something to exercise
the grey matter, something to ballast
the lecture notes, something to edu-

cate you or quicken your imagina-
tion.

And you will talk, if not in class
(it isn’t always possible), then with
profs on the wing or among your
cronies, in the hangout, over a beer,
across the bed, at table, or over the
back seat returning from Sweetbriar
(where you might have tried
talking a little with her). But you
won’t do all the talking though some
of it, and a lot of listening; and you'll
pick brains and suffer yours to be
picked trying, with your fellows, to
learn something from someone who
knows more than you do, or some-
thing other than you do. And you
will be willing to argue, over things
that are arguable. You will, in
short, exercise the intellect you are
building.

We've already been over the busi-
ness of courses, and I think we were
right to plan for scope instead of
narrowsness. Graduate school is time
enough to specialize, just now we
want to furnish your mind gener-
ously and to set it free.

They talk about Washington and
Lee as a party school, but you and
I know that is precisely one reason
why we chose it. We weren't, after
all, looking for a monastery, but
for a place where your total man-
hood could be brought into play
and tested. That is why I expect

Monday

I had an interesting talk today
with a student who plans to enter
seminary next year. He visited a
well-known northern theological
school over Thanksgiving, and there
the Dean told him of the role that
seminary’s students play in national
affairs.

The Dean spoke with pride about
the students from his school who had
been thrown in Mississippi jails. The
seminary had taken no cetion until
one of its professors was also jailed.
It was a matter of pride to this par-
ticular Dean that his students had
stood up for what they believed.

I couldn’t help but think that had
Washington and Lee students been
jailed in Mississippi, they probably
would have been placed on conduct
probation for the rest of their stay
here. Perhaps they would have been
thrown out of school altogether.

As I understand it, a political con-
servative is opposed to a concen-
tration of powers in government. It
seems funny, therefore, that when
the Tuesday Edition of the paper
proposes that the campus press be
taken out from under the control of
the student government, the oppon-
ents of the proposal are the so-called
political conservatives. And the stu-
dents who are making the proposal
are labeled liberals—even “radicals.”
Someone is being inconsistent.

December 11, 1963
Wednesday

A rather sickening discovery: over
Thanksgiving here in Lexington, the
lights went out for quite some time.
The stores were open, and most of
them lost quite a bit of merchandise.
Apparently the food stores suffered
most—one in particular had its meat
counter completely stripped. And a
couple identified as a Washington
and Lee student with his wife were
seen leaving this same store, he with
his overcoat loaded with goods, and
she carrying everything she could
handle. The cosmetic counter also
had been stripped in that particular
store.

Why should the physical education
department be allowed to fail a
student who misses eight classes
(whether he’s on the Dean’s List or
not). Especially when there is no
such thing as an “excused absence”
in P.E. Those eight cuts are theoret-
ically to be used when one is not
feeling well, or when one is going to
be out of town (even on school bus-
iness).

December 13, 1963
Friday

A word about the Friday Edition’s
unrealistic editorial: I don’t believe
conventional dress is a “mutually
agreed-upon practice.” And the let-
ter which appeared in this edition,
endorsing the abolition of the As-
similation Committee, signed by half
of that came committee and a few
EC members, indicates to me that
the “means of enforcement” is not
“mutually agreed-upon,” as the edi-
torial states.

Conventional dress is a “tradi-
tional rule” in my opinion, and as
such it should have some of the ves-
tiges of a rule, as well as the appear-
ance of a tradition. Or it will die.

Hypocrite that I am (that we all

much more than I can say for a vast
majority of my student colleagues.
I got a brief insight into the reason
why last night: a forlorn fraternity
man, engaged in that post-party rit-
ual which I indelicately refer to as
the “rite of barf.” Some day, he too

Hoopsters Lose;

Play C.U. Next

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

The prospects for a Washington
and Lee basketball championship in
the CAC tournament seem small
as the Generals have already found
one team in the eonference that is
stronger than they are. Saturday’s
game with Centre College provided
evidence for this statement as the
Colonels rolled to an easy 86-70 vic-
tory over the Generals at Centre.

W&L is now even for four games
but plays host to tough Catholic
University tonight at 8:00. Catholic
is led by veterans Bill Lehay and
Charlie Boylan. The visitors bring
with them a record of 4-3 and a
recent victory over Roanoke Col-
lege, one of the more highly re-
garded teams in Virginia.

The Colonels took the lead for
keeps about midway through the
first half and coasted from there.
The first half shooting percentages
tell the story as the winners hit on
60 per cent of their shots while
W&L could make only 25 per cent of
their attempts.

The Generals also were defeated
by their own sloppy ball handling
and Centre’s complete control of the
boards. The losers lost the ball 20
times on bad passes and steals.

Louie Paterno, W&L’s star guard,
was the leading scorer for the game
with 20 points, while Don Wallis
contributed 12 and Fred Mindel

Miller’s matmen meet an un-

the year’s most exciting matches,
pitting two of the area’s top wrest-
ling teams and some of the South’s
finest individual matches in the “bat-
tle of the unbeatens.”

In the two matches this weekend,
W&lL first met Hartwick College and
pins by Pete Winfield and Steward
led the Generals to an easy, 21-8
victory. General leader Smith, who
crushed his opponent easily, 18-0, Ed
Jansen and Stover all gained de-
cisions to help the winning cause.
Dick Musick, in the 130-pound class,
contributed two points by gaining a
draw.

Oneonta State College provided
much stiffer competition, and the
Generals needed pins by Steward—
his second in three matches—and
Musick for a 19-13 decision. Smith
and Stover both added their second
victories, and 137-pounder Don Pat-

Part II—‘Who To Watch This Winter’

Tankmen Eye Good Year;
Depth Brings 2-1 Record

By GEORGE BOKINSKY

The W&L swimming team, coached by NORRIS EASTMAN, has pro-
duced a 2 and 1 record so far this season. Returning members of last
year’s squad, along with a strong group of freshmen, present a promising
outlook for the remaining meets of the season.

Victorious in its first meet of the season over Roanoke College, then
bowing to a strong UVa. team, W&L bounced back with a win over
Loyola of Baltimore. Traveling to Washington on Wednesday the tank-
men will swim Catholic University in the last contest before the Christmas
break. Practices this week indicated that the team will be in good shape
for the meet.

With the unusual depth of the team, Coach Eastman is able to juggle
his swimmers from event to event. JIM WALLENSTEIN, co-captain, is
performing well in the breaststroke, with the other captain, WALT Mc-
MANUS, doing well in both the butterfly and 200-yard freestyle. McManus
was on the record-setting freestyle relay in the Loyola meet.

Among the junior lettermen returning from last year’s squad is BILL
BRODDUS—a backstroker who set a school record in that event against
Loyola. Broaddus was also on the opening medley relay team that holds
a W&L school mark. SKIP CHASE, who swam mainly breaststroke last
season, now takes on an additional race in the 50-yard freestyle. JOHN
WOLFE, a returning record-holder, is proficient in almost all the freestyle
races.

Only two sophomore letermen are returning from last year’s Varsity.
JOHN LIFTER, former holder of backstroke mark, now is a member of the
record-holding medley relay. Lifter is able to swim the individual medley,
breaststroke, backstroke, 500-yard frestyle, as wel las the relay. GEORGE
BOKINSKY, individual medley and butterfly records, swims in the individ-
ual medley, butterfly, breaststroke, or medley relay.

In the diving event two starters from last season’s team have returned.
BRUCE HOUGHTON and DAVE GREER have performed well in that
event this year. Against Loyola, Houghton and Greer took the top two
places.

Promising members of last year’s “B” squad are vieing for positions.
STEVE CASE is rapidly improving in the 500 freestyle as is HOWARD
BUSSE who, in addition, can swim the butterfly. NELSON WILLIAMS
participates in several events, but concentrates mainly on the freestyle
races.

A member of both record-setting relays, STEVE LESTER is near the
school mark in the 100-yard free. Lester is capable of swimming the
breaststroke and individual medley in addition. Also close to a record
is BART TAYLOR—on the record freestyle relay. Taylor swims the 50 and
100 freestyle. GARY BOKINSKY, another member of the record-holding
relay, concentrates on the 200 and 500-yard freestyle and on the individ-
ual medley.

BILL WILDRICK swam the butterfly leg of the record-breaking relay.
Wildrick can swim a variety of events with proficiency. He is able to
swim in the relay, butterfly, individual medley, and several freestyles.
BLAIR BROWN has done well in the individual medley. STEVE LUNDE
is showing a great deal of promise in the backstroke, losing to Broaddus by
only a touch in the event.

The added depth of the team also increases the competition for starting
positions. This competition will result in the better efforts that will lead
to a winning season.

By SKIP CHASE
Tuesday Sports Writer
The Generals of Norris Eastman ruled the waves Saturday
afternoon in nipping Loyola of Baltimore, 49-46. Bringing

their seasonal mark to 2-1, the “Big Blue” was lead by John
Wolfe, Bill Broaddus, Bruce Houton, Pete Taylor, and Jim

Wallenstein, all of whom took cru-*
tial firsts.

W&L won the medley relay, the

 

50-yard freestyle, placed first and
second in the diving, and first and
second in the 200-yard breaststroke.
School records were set by Wolfe,
the 500-yard free; Broaddus, the
200-yard back; and the medley relay.
Eclipsing a pool record set by the

and “Barefoot Boy With Cheek’’.)

DECK THE HALLS

The time has come to think of Christmas shopping, for the
Yuletide will be upon us quicker than you can say Jack Robin-
son. (Have you ever wondered, incidentally, about the origin
of this interesting phrase “Quicker than you can say Jack
Robinson”? Well sir, the original saying was French—“Plus
vite que de dire Jacques Robespierre.” Jack Robinson is, as every-
one knows, an Anglicization of Jacques Robespierre who was,
as everyone knows, the famous figure from the French Revolu-
tion who, as everyone knows, got murdered in his bath by
Danton, Murat, Caligula, and Al Capone.

(The reason people started saying “Quicker than you can
say Jacques Robespierre’’—or Jack Robinson, as he is called in
English-speaking countries like England, the U.S., and Cleve-
land—is quite an interesting little story. It seems that Robes-
pierre’s wife, Georges Sand, got word of the plot to murder
her husband in his bath. All she had to do to save his life was
call his name and warn him. But, alas, quicker than she could
say Jacques Robespierre, she received a telegram from her old
friend Frederie Chopin who was down in Majorca setting lyrics

    
 

ee ne

as | ie rte A me om a :
Al 4he bad to co 03 call Ws name

to his immortal “Warsaw Concerto.” Chopin said he needed

Georges Sand’s help desperately because he could not find a

rhyme for “Warsaw.” Naturally, Georges could not refuse

such an urgent request.

(Well sir, off to Majorca went Georges, but before she left,
she told her little daughter Walter that some bad men were
coming to murder Daddy in his bath. She instructed Walter
to shout Robespierre’s name the moment the bad men arrived.
But Walter, alas, had been sea-bathing that morning on the
Riviera, and she had come home with a big bag of salt water
taffy, and when the bad men arrived to murder Robespierre,
Walter, alas, was chewing a wad of taffy and could not get her
mouth unstuck in time to shout a warning. Robespierre, alas,
was murdered quicker than you could say Jacques Robespierre
—or Jack Robinson, as he is called in English-speaking countries.

(There is, I am pleased to report, one small note of cheer
in this grisly tale. When Georges Sand got to Majorca, she did
succeed in helping Chopin find a rhyme for “Warsaw” as every-
one knows who has heard those haunting lyrics:

In the fair town of Warsaw,
Which Napoleon’s horse saw,
Singing cockles and mussels, alive alive o!)

But I digress.

We were speaking of Christmas gifts. What we all try to
find at Christmas is, of course, unusual and distinctive gifts for
our friends. May I suggest then a carton of Marlboro Cigarettes?

What? You are astonished? You had not thought of Marlboros

 

as unusual? You had regarded them as familiar, reliable smokes
whose excellence varied not one jot nor tittle from year to year?
True. All true. But all the same, Marlboros are unusual be-

cause every time you try one, it’s like the first time. The flavor
never palls, the filter never gets hackneyed, the soft pack is

ever a new delight, and so is the Flip Top box. Each Marlboro
is a fresh and pristine pleasure, and if you want all your friends
to clap their hands and cry, “Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa
Claus!” you will see that their stockings are filled with Marl-

boros on Christmas morn. ® 1963 Max Shulman

* * *

The holiday season or any other season is the season to be
jolly—if Marlboro is your brand, You'll find Marlboros wher-
ever cigarettes are sold in all fifty states of the Union. You
get a lot to like in Marlboro Country.

(Continued from page 1)

The proposal that the fraternities

to obtain discount through volume

the idea would require a salaried
overseer and whatever discount to
be gained would be lost to his salary.

In the past H.M.A. has been all
but inactive, and seeks to take a
greater role as a service to the col-
lege. Composed of the house manag-
ers and house treasurers, the H.M.A.
is working with the Executive Com-
mittee, the Interfraternity Council,
and the faculty to develop itself as a
functional, purposeful organization
orientated around fraternity serv-
ice. It has in the past seen to the

maintenance, and procurement, and
sees to special pest control as well
as the annual pest protection.

fine art of smoking, drinking, and

sideration, both for yourself and
for others (including that sweet
little thing from Sweetbriar). I
cannot praise a fugitive and clois-
tered virtue either. I don’t really
think there is any such thing.

I want you to ride off in many
directions, to involve yourself as
diversely as you can without fall-
ing into the gulf of mere super-
ficiality, to study, converse, extra-
curricular it, learn the superiority
of Scotch over Bourbon, the stupidi-

The Light Brigade led GMA, 30-28,
at halftime intermission due to the
set-shots by Saunders and the drives
of Fisher. But the visitors came to
life in the second half and tied the
score 45-all and then jumped into a
seven point lead which was main-
tained despite five final points by
Ogilvy and two by Frank Morrison
just before the final buzzer.

The Baby Generals travel to play
Staunton Military Academy on
Wednesday for their last game be-
fore the holidays, hoping to increase
their record to five wins against one
loss.

 

THE DRAWING
for the SWMSEFC raffle will be
held during the halftime of
the basketball game tonight.
Tickets available at the

The

Lexington M otel

Has completed its fourth year of successful operation. We are
grateful to the many industries in the area, to Washington and Lee
University, to Virginia Military Institute, to Southern Seminary and
to the many families and merchants for being the reason over 80,000
visitors have chosen our fine Motel as their visiting headquarters.

These guests have helped many of our successful merchants in
purchasing food, clothing, dry cleaning, gasoline, gifts, camera sup-
plies, drugs and entertainment.

In addition, the Lexington Motel directly contributed to the eco-
nomic stability of our community through the use of its utilities, gas,
electricity, water and telephone, through the services of local com-
panies in painting, heating, repairs, maintenance, laundry ad mis-
cellaeous services, through its annual payroll of over $20,000.00

and payment of takes and licenses to operate.

WE THANK YOU AND WANT YOU TO KNOW
WE ARE PROUD TO BE A PART OF THIS COMMUNITY
