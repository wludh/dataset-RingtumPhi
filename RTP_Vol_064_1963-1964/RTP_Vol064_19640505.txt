nessed by an estimated 12,000 peo-
ple Monday afternoon. A Lexington
merchant, Arthur Silver, claimed it
was the best he had ever seen, and
he has been present for 10 previous
parades.

The parade was headed by 2 live
elephants, representing the Repub-
licean Party. Following the elephants
were floats from 53 state delegations
and US. 6 bands, and
several beauty queens. Some of the
beauties present were Jacquelyn

Jeannie Amecker, Miss Texas; Elaine

Gains, Miss South Carolina; Dorcas
Campbell, Miss Virginia.

Many of the floats were based
on a Barry Goldwater theme. Some
of the floats read “Let's Barry|
Em” and “Barry or Secession.”
Other themes were anti-Lyndon
Johnson, such as one which dis-
played Johnson and his “Friends!
Secretary of Agriculture Billie Sol

Estes and Secretary of the Treasury

Bobby Baker.”

bined both these themes by dis-

a large figure of the state inscribed
with “LBJ Bar-B-Q.”

Some of the floats favored the
other prominent candidates being
considered in the convention, New
York Governor Nelson Rockefeller,
former Vice-President Richard Nix-
on, Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge,

Pennsylvania Governor William
Scranton, and Senator Margaret
Chase Smith.

Other floats supported “darkhorse”
candidates such Frank Sinatra,
who was favored by Nevada as the
best “you could do for $19:95.” One
of the lesser known political parties,
the CroFaunJo Party, supported a
gangster character named Ed Side.

Editor-in-Chief

The 1964 Republican Mock Convention at W&L nominated
Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona on the second ballot
at 3 p.m. today. Goldwater polled 718 convention votes to win
over his closest opponent, Governor Nelson Rockefeller of

New York, by 500 votes. Rockfeller polled 218 votes.
After the Wisconsin state chairman had cast all of his state’s

30 votes for Goldwater to put the*
Arizona Senator over the necessary
655 votes to win, the voting was
continued until Jimmie T. Sylvester,
chairman of the California delega-
tion, moved that the convention
accept Goldwater by acclamation.
The aye’s and nay’s were close, but
the motion was passed.

Behind Rockefeller in the final
voting were Governor William
Seranton of Pennsylvania with 182
votes, Richard Nixon with 106 votes,
and Henry Cabot Lodge with 104

 

votes. |

water’s nomination by acclamation |
the Senator accepted the nomina-,
tion by phone, and his acceptance |

The pattern of Goldwater's
tory was obvious from the start of
the second ballot. After nine states
had voted, the vote total on the|
second ballot was 100 for Goldwater
and 97 for Rockefeller, his closest
rival as opposed to 82 for Gold-|
water and 98 for Rockefeller at the}
same point on the first ballot.

With nineteen states voting, Gold- |
water polled 273 votes on the sec-|
ond ballot to Rockefeller’s 113; on |

vic- |

 

the first ballot, the count at the
same point had been 247 votes for
Goldwater and 103 for Rockefeller.
With twenty-six voting
Goldwater received 324 votes on
the second ballot, and Rockefeller
had pulled up to only 117 votes, but
it seemed for moment as if the
second ballot would not show
enough additional votes to put Gold-
water over the top. On the first
ballot at the same point, Goldwater

The Product Of A Year’s Work
By Eight Dedicated Students

It’s over now. Like the endless hours of preparation which
go into a 30-minute concert, the year of careful planning for
the 1964 W&L Mock Convention came to life in two days of
pomp, corcumstance, and well-documented balloting. Most of
us were on the periphery of things, drinking beer at delegation
parties and maintaining a steady gaze at the many beauty
queens who were guests of the convention. But there are a few
students who deserve to be singled out for their roles as plan-

ners of the pageant.

Sharp, Durrette, Rowe, and Madison

Philip Sharp, chairman of the Mock Convention Steering
Committee, has been the driving spirit behind the work of a
year. The success of the convention is the result of his con-
stant planning and his constant help with the work of other
members of the Steering Committee. He never contented
himself with being a coordinator—he worked himself to make
sure that each job would be done well.

It was Sharp who had the problem of getting speakers for
the convention which began as soon as he was appointed last
June. From then on, he was engaged in not only this, his pri-
mary responsibility, but all the other jobs too.

Wyatt Durrette, Chairman of the Republican Party for
the convention, was the political advisor not only to the Steer-
ing Committee, but to all fifty state chairmen. It was his respon-
sibility to guide the choice of the Mock Convention and to
make it as accurate as possible. From the beginning he felt
that the outstanding record of the past Mock Conventions was
a heavy burden on him, and he never stopped trying to keep
the record accurate. It was a job for which he had to lay aside
very deep personal convictions, and he did so consciously, in
order that his thinking would not influence the result of the
convention. Durrette had every political personality, trend,
poll, primary, and bill before Congress on the tips of his fingers,
and was the source to which Mock Convention officials went
for any political information.

Charles B. Rowe was assistant chairman of the convention,
but his real job was as financial chairman. Rowe did more than
a sufficient job of raising money for the convention, and be-
yond that he was the Mock Convention “banker,” handling
all the expenditures. After his task of money-raising was fin-
ished, he turned to publishing the convention Official Program.

The Parade Chairman was John Madison, but the title does
not do justice to the work performed. After lining up the big-
est parade in Mock Convention history, he began trying to
make Doremus Gymnasium look like a convention hall. Madi- |
son scoured the Virginia countryside looking for bands, and
spent more time trying to get elephants and decorations for |
floats. He also worked with the state delegations all year in an
effort to produce floats which would make a good parade.

 

Partington, Norton, Straub, and Smith

Donald Partington was Chairman of State Delegations,

vention. Perhaps the most tedious work of the convention

    

was Partington’s interviews with each state chairman, an oper-
ation through which he had to go several times. But equally
trying, perhaps, was the responsibility of prodding state chair-
men who not working as expected; here too Partington carried
the ball.

Edward Norton, Secretary of the Mock Convention,
handled a correspondence this year which seems fantastic to
a student, or any person who has never worked the corres-
pondence of a big organization. Norton and the Secretariat
of the convention pushed through more than a thousand letters
from the Steering Committee itself. Without Norton on call
for letters at any time, it is difficult to see how the Mock Con-
vention could have gotten off the ground. Norton also was
charged with the Mock Convention records, something which
was neglected in past conventions, and with the balloting in

The party composed of 10 frater-
nities, was formed from the now de-
funct University Party with the ad-
dition of two new houses, Sigma
Nu, and Pi Kappa Alpha, and the
loss of three others: Phi Ep, DU and
Sigma Chi. At present the party ros-
ter includes: Sigma Nu, Lambda Chi |

ma Phi Epsilon. |

The chief significance of the re-|
alignment that Red Square is}
united again in alcost the same lines}
the old party that successfully |
dominated campus polities for ay
years.

The Party, led by Pi Phi junior,
Patton Adams, advocates a return to
a balanced party system, “although
the Liberty Party at present will
maintain a slight vote majority, such
majority would not be hard for any
other party to overcome.”

The “other party,” when it unites,
will be composed of seven fraterni-
ties. The remaining fraternity, Sig-
ma Chi, has adopted a policy of in-
dependence and remains unaffiliated
with the political blocks.

The sole purpose of the newly
formed party it “to nominate only
those persons who present them-
selves as the best qualified and most
capable for filling the positions.” The
Party “shall endeavor at all times
to present to you, the student body,
the best men we have.” Futhermore,

“appeasement will take no prece-
dence in our decisions.”

A {fier Campus Political Shake-up

 

Sigma Chi Decides On Neutrality

| now
_and is at work on a critical biogra-

Last Sunday, the Sigma Chi House
announced its intentions to sever its
connection with the W&L “clique”
system and to remain independent.
The unprecedented decision was
made with only one dissenting vote
in an emergency chapter meeting
Saturday.

In taking this course of action, the
fraternity determined that it would
no longer vote as a unit but as in-
dividual members in no way tied to
any party organization.

The following declaration was is-
sued Sunday evening:

“To the students of Washington
and Lee:

“The Sigma Chi House has de-
cided to renounce all affiliation
with any political party or clique.
In future elections, the members
intend to vote as individuals for
those candidates they consider
most qualified.

“We choose to become indepen-
dent because the present clique
system is an unjust and outmoded
means of providing competent stu-
dent leadership.

“we hope that | our action will

lead to superior student govern-
ment. We ask you to consider the
present political system—as indi-
viduals and students of Washing-
ton and Lee.

The Sigma Chi House”

In an interview, Sigma Chi presi-
dent Hal Holladay stated that
Sigma Chi House has decided to
become independent for three rea-
sons. First, we are opposed to the
present political system because it
does not always provide the student
body with the best candidates, and
because it gives only a few students
a voice in who is nominated.
“Secondly, the members wish to

able to vote as they choose for
whomever they choose without being
intimidated by any clique or party.

be

“It is our opinion that so long as
the clique system exists, the stu-
dent government of this university
will not have a chance either to be
selected or operated in a fair and
democratic manner.

“We in Sigma Chi believe that
every member of the student body
is aware of the evils of the present
system and we hope that our action

Sigma Chi’s withdrawal from the

the formation of the “Liberty Par-
ty,’ which once again threw the
campus into a state of political flux.

Sigma Chi political representative

Nick Ruffin added to Holladay’s
comments, “This fraternity’s mea-
sure is a result of our disgust at}

still another change in the political
situation which does nothing but re-
hash the same old thing. We believe
that this constant revolution in
campus politics represents a grop-
ing attempt to escape the clique
system. We hope that there is a
way of doing this, through individ-
ual house action.”

Sigma Chi’s withdrawal from par-
ty politics leaves the two current |
parties split unevenly, ten to seven.

Letter To The Editor

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi
I have seen farces in my life, but
I believe that the new “Liberty Par-
ty” takes the cake. Not a few times
have the students at Washington
and Lee been deluded by shrewd
politicians, but this outrage is an
affront to the intelligence of a mo-
ron. No doubt you have heard the
cliche “A rose is a rose...”; by
the same token, so’s a_ skunk.
Strange things fear works with the
high and mighty.

split on this ballot but which cast
significant majorities to Goldwater
were: Illinois, Kentucky, North
Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.

Rockefeller’s Support

The bulk of Rockefeller’s votes
came from California, which gave
him all 86 of its convention votes,
and from New York which threw its
92 votes to the governor. Governor

Convention Boasts Lots Of Color

Almost unrecognizable under the
most elaborate decorations of any
past Mock Convention, Doremus
Gymnasium resounded with dozens
of instances of spontaneous, thun-
derous applause at the opening ses-
sion of the convention Monday af-
ternoon. Part of the show was the
speeches delivered by the distin-
guished guests, Lukens, Poff, and
Judd. The rest of it was the sight
of the “convention hall,” the color-
ful outfits worn by many of the
state delegations.

Red, white and blue bunting
was everywhere; balloons hung
from the ceiling. Every state was
represented by its flag, hanging
from the guard rail of the indoor
track. A huge Rockefeller poster
dominated the west end of the
room, with a less conspicuous
Goldwater poster facing it on the
east side. Between them and on
either side were posters proclaim-
ing the qualities of Ledge, Nixon,
Scranton, and Smith,

The ceiling of the gym was al-
most obscured not only by candi-
dates’ posters but by circular
“GOP” signs, American flags, and
convention paraphernalia of every
size and description.

No less colorful was the conven-
tion floor, jammed with delegates,
many of whom waved state flags
or banners with the names and
pictures of the candidates backed
by their state. “Indiana’s Sold on
Goldwater,” and the white-on-red

The Kentucky delegation was
dressed in blue shirts, red string

white “Morton” bands; the Texas
delegation wore straw hats and

blue shirts and red suspenders with
white ducks and straw hats; Okla-

Rockefeller did not poll more than
7 votes in any other state.

Seranton’s support, centered only
in Pennsylvania and its 64 votes,
picked up seattered votes from other
states, notably New Jersey, which
gave him 11 of its 40 votes.

After the first ballot, the conven-
tion was recessed for two hours for
the purpose of allowing the western
states to call their headquarters. The
motion to recess was passed, 32-20,
with one abstention.

will be given perpetually. The
award is given solely on the basis
of service, rather than in considera-
tion of need.

Earlier this year the EC had
asked for recommendations from
interested students as to who should
receive the award, and the judging
for the eventual recipient was then
made solely on the basis of valuable
contribution to student affairs. This
contribution need not have been
made through any student office or
established organization, and may
take the form of outstanding work
in one or several fields.

flesh that fits the cup of the hand
yet rises into an arm’s embrace, a
seat of power. In front, they descend
from the mount of Venus—what a
name!—slope out and down, a round
mount, to touch, to taste, to tickle
the eye. They sigh from the body
like love itself. And the flanks at
each side, the musclar fold, the line
that never lives but when it lies
quite still.”

The issue also includes fiction
and essays by Gene Boro, Richard
Ohmann, and Joseph Kostolefsky, a
selection of poems and four reviews.
It is now on sale for 75 cents.
