Campaign Highlighted By Par

Kulp Asserts
Age Is Asset
In Debate

Big Four candidates from both
parties met head-on last night in a
debate in duPont Auditorium.

UP candidate Jim Kulp opened the
debate with a talk dealing primarily
with his ability, in spite of law
school status, to represent the inter-
ests of the undergraduate student
body. Kulp also stressed how im-
portant W&L’s traditions and their
preservation were ‘to him.

“As an EC member this year,”
Kulp said, “I have attempted to
acquaint myself with the workings
of the student government here.”

Hitting at criticisms which have
been leveled at him as an older
person, Kulp declared, “My age is
an asset, and it would lend ma-
turity of judgment, I hope, to my
decisions as student body presi-
dent.”

He admitted he thought “some
problems do exist in our student
government,” cited EC-student re-
lations as one of the chief prob-
lems. Confessing that “I don’t have
the answers to the problems,” Kulp
made clear his intentions to seek
solutions.

Progressive candidate Lamar
Lamb, in his initial speech, told the
audience what he thought the EC’s
function was. “On the one hand, we
have our student body,” he said,
“and on the other, the traditions
and ideals that W&L stands for.
Properly, the student government
correlates the two, serving as the
liaison between the institutions of
the University and the student
body.”

Lamb said that each member of
the EC should seek “to represent
that which is best in our institu-
tions, and to represent student
opinions in the interpretation of

 

these institutions.”

He took a stand clearly in favor
of more equalized party politics, and
quoted both party chairmen as say-
ing they would like to see the un-
equal party line-up changed.

Steve Smith, Progressive candi-
date, was first vice-presidential
hopeful to speak.

Smith stressed the fact that the
Progressives were campaigning on
a policy of more truly representa-
tive government on the EC.

DeYoung concentrated on the |
worth of the UP platform. He gave
special attention to the two planks
dealing with the student opinion
poll and monthly class officer meet-
ings.

UP candidate for secretary Mal-
colm Morris spent most of his time
on the problem of communication
existing between the EC and the
student body. He emphasized two
means of alleviating the problem:
better information on the Honor
System, “maybe reporting exactly
what happens” in the case of viola-
tions, and publishing EC agenda and
posting HC minutes.

Brooks Brown, Morris’s opponent
based his speech on the Progressive
platform, pointing out plank by
plank how it would best serve the
student body.

Following speeches by each of the
candidates was a question and an-
swer period.

Kulp, when asked what changes
in the present assimilation policy
he would favor, answered that
“Myself, I know there are prob-
lems, but I don’t have any an-
swers, Maybe we could run a stu-
dent poll to get suggestions,” he
added.

Lamb, who a year ago suggested
the idea of graduated penalties in
honor violations, was asked to elab-
orate on why his mind had changed,
and if he would guarantee that it
would not change again. He an-
swered that he had “expressed a
certain need last year for certain
flexibility in the punishment; but
more flexibility brings up two
problems: first of all, it is impos-
sible to decide who should receive
the lighter penalty, and secondly, a

Independents To Support
Lamb, Smith, And Morris

The Independent Union,

meeting at 6:30 last night,

gave their support to Lamar Lamb for president, Steve Smith
for vice-president, and Malcolm Morris for secretary of the

student body.

However, a spokesman for the Independents pointed out
that these endorsements were made by the recommendation of

the Independent Steering Committee*¥

after several meetings with all the
candidates from both parties, and
later verified by a hand-vote of the
non-fraternity body last night.

The Independents were urged to
vote for the candidates they per-
sonally preferred, although the en-
dorsed ones were thought to be best
for the school and most helpful in
NFU objectives. In making their de-
cision, they broke party lines and
emphasized importance of the indi-
vidual over party.

By a hand vote the members de-
feated a motion to endorse a candi-
date for president of Fancy Dress.
The steering committee also failed to
endorse a candidate.

Convening in the Student Union,
the candidates of both parties were
subjected to questions from the
floor.

When asked about the possibility
of change in the Honor System,
Lamb said he favored continual
midification if it were both neces-
sary and for the betterment of the
system. He feared the system’s be-
coming stagnant in tradition, and
proposed an EC subcommittee to ex-
amine honor systems throughout the |
country and study possible improve-
ments.

 

Kulp responded to Lamb’s state-
ment by saying, “We are not in the

 

least to try to stay with what we
have...we are going to seek infor-
mation.” However, he failed to issue
any definte plans.

Both vice-presidential candidates
proposed identical platforms, stress-
ing town-school relations and stu-
dent body EC liaison.

The candidates for secretary both
emphasized the need for published
EC minutes, and open meetings, al-
though there was a brief misunder-
standing as to whether a large
crowd would be advisable at meet-
ings.

After an accusation by the UP
that the Progressives feared certain
individuals at meetings, Brooks
Brown clarified the issue by pointing
out that he didn’t favor large crowds
at EC meetings because of the ob-
vious hindrance and retarding of
EC business.

In closing the interview, each
candidate gave a brief speech. Lamb
emphasized that, being a non-frater-
nity man himself, he realized the
Independents would have to help
themselves in their endeavors and
could not expect the EC to achieve
their gains for them. In doing this,
he made it clear that he would not
encourage votes if the voters ex-
pected special favor in return.

Jim Kulp repeated this view

A ‘Dead Issue’ Rears Its Ugly Head:
Big Clique Domination May Return

The most interesting feature of
this year’s Big Four election is that
of the new political parties result-
ing from the Delt-SPE switch.

Depending on the outcome, the
election will prove either that party
ties and straight-ticket voting is
a defunct thing of the past, or that
Big Clique politics and one-party
domination has returned to the

* campus after a short interlude of a

more or
system.

The revolt of the two Progressive
Party houses is understandable
when viewed in context of the past
couple of years. Both Delts and
SPE’s have a history of breaking
party ranks.

First SPE Switch

Two years ago, the SPE’s, only
three years old but aspiring to po-
litical potency, deserted the old In-
dependent Party to join the domi-
nate UP. SPE ascension to the Big
Clique left the Independents with
only seven houses and even more of
a political cripple than it had been
before.

The imbalance in parties contin-
ued until February, 1963, when a
coalition of five former University
and four Independent Party houses
sought to equalize the party system
by formation of the Progressive
Party. The SPE’s and the Delts were
among the nine houses which made
the move.

less balanced two-party

 

Delt Dissension

The new party, although at last
bringing a measure of equality to
the party system, lacked the stability
of the old UP. In the first election
in which the Progressives partici-
pated—last year’s Big Four—Delt
dissension was its biggest headache.

A Delt nominated the UP candi-
date for president, and actively cam-
paigned against the candidate from
his own party.

UP Must Win

If the present coalition is to con-
tinue, it is extremely important for
the UP to sweep the Big Four this
week and to take a sizeable number
of class officers next month.

It can do both—if it can manage
somehow to hold together its eleven
houses and manufacture party loy-
alty, and to recreate the straight-
ticket voting that prevailed in the
heyday of UP dominance.

Thus the present election is cru-
cial to the UP; if they lose, it will
mean in effect that party ties are
untenable and that the old system
cannot be revived. They know this,
and are running a furious, intense
campaign.

Influence of NFU and Law

The law and non-fraternity stu-
dents will have some effect on the
election, but chances are they will
negate each other. In all probabili-
ty, the UP will carry the law school

Both Political Parties Emphasize
Role Of EC And Honor System

The platforms of both the Uni-
versity and Progressive parties seem
directed towards a more represen-
tative student government than now
exists. They have three mutual con-
cerns: the Honor System, Freshmen,
and the acquainting of the student
body with the results of EC meet-
ings. From proposals on these sub-
jects they go on to widely diver-
sified planks and affirmations, such
as the PP’s plan to petition for use

of alcoholic beverages at University
dances to the UP’s statement of be-
lief in the Assimilation Committee.

Both platforms agree that the
Honor System is “structurally
sound.” In addition, both feel
measures should be taken to bet-
ter educate the student body as
to it’s functioning. However, the
University Party platform fails to
disclose how it intends to ac-
complish this, while the Progres-
sive platform specifies two ways
in which it would carry out this
measure, in addition to calling
for “continued reappraisal” in or-
der to insure that the system re-
mains just.

Both parties attempt to carry the
freshman vote. The Progressive
platform proposes an open primary
to enable the freshman class to
choose an EC member representative
of them, instead of political cliques.
The University Party favors a “con-
stitutional change creating fresh-
man class officers.”

The UP Platform promises to pub-
lish agendas and minutes of each
EC meeting in order to acquaint
the students with the results of
their deliberations. The Progressive
Party, going a step further, sup-
ports open meetings of the EC in
addition to promising to publish the
votes of each member on each issue.

Aside from these issues, the Pro-
gressive Party promises to seek per-
mission “for the regulated use of
alcoholic beverages at University
Dance functions’ by the use of
drink tickets; to rewrite the consti-
tution to remove ambiguities and
contradictions without altering its
basic structure; and pledges support
of the IFC’s projected plans for
“Contact” weekend.

The University Party includes four
additional planks. Besides their sup-
port of the Assimilation Committee,
they would require monthly meet-
ings of the class officers, conduct
interviews with prospective commit-
tee appointees, and conduct campus-
wide opinion polls when in doubt
about “controversial questions.”

 

Students Asked To Ratify
Constitutional Changes
In Thursday’s Balloting

Thursday, students will be
to ratify two constitutional amend-
ments when they vote for Big Four
officers.

The first amendment provides for
the EC, upon two-thirds vote in
two consecutive meetings, to alter
the prescribed date of class elections
as specified in the constitution.

The constitution now says
class elections be held on the
Monday in May. This year,
ample, Mock Convention
that date.

The second change is designed to
fill the void in the constitution per-
taining to placement of students
entering school at times other than
September. This amendment speci-
fies that a late-entering student
will be placed in the class according
to his placement as set by the Reg-
istrar.

Both amendments were
unanimously by the EC

for ex-|

 

because of Kulp. Since law students
are largely out of touch with the
undergraduate situation, they will
likely vote straight UP rather than
choose among candidates they don’t
know anyway.

The bulk of the Independent vote
will go to the Progressives. They
will, most spokesman from both
parties agree, support Lamb and
Smith as well as Kreitler, and will
depart from the Progressives only
in the case of Morris.

Individuals and Issues

If the Progressives are to win,
they must do it on the basis of in-
dividuals and issues, not party ties.
They know this, and are thus cen-
tering their campaign around quali-
fications of candidates, platforms,
and individual competence.

In the presidential race, Lamb's
strong point is his experience and
direct contact with the student body.
Though he must fight against the
UP majority, he has in his favor
both his undergraduate status and
his active participation as an EC
member for two years.

Kulp’s Biggest Weakness

Kulp must somehow overcome
law school status. He also has to
convince students that he can be-
come sufficiently acquainted with
the undergraduate community
(which is radically different from the
law school) to serve as its presi-
dent. Kulp’s biggest weakness—
law school membership, and_ its
consequent separation from the rest
of the University—is augmented by
the fact that he attended Hampden-
Sydney as an undergraduate. Nearly
all of his qualifications were earned
there and consequently hold little
weight at W&lL, critics contend.

Kulp does have the argument of
maturity in his favor, since at 30 he
is at least ten years older than the
average undergraduate; however,
some Progressives are bound to use
this as a point of criticism, hold-
ing that a man of Kulp’s age would
be unable to best represent the in-
terest of a much younger student
body.

Cleanth Brooks
Lectures For

Phi Beta Kappa

Cleanth Brooks addressed the
Cincinnati Society-Phi Beta Kappa
assembly yesterday on “American
Innocence as Viewed by Henry
James, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Wil-
liam Faulkner.” Taking a book by
each author, Mr. Brooks examined
and compared the major characters

 

of each one, and endeavored to
show the “American Innocence” in
each.

In James The American, as in

Fitagerald’s The Great Gatsby, he
showed that both Christopher New-
man and Jay Gatsby were self-
made men, not only in material con-
sideration, but in that they created

| their own personalities.

‘Elephantiasis of the Will
These personalities tended to have
“elephantiasis of the will,” and fore-
ed so much self absorption that they

| could not grasp reality.

Here, too, is Faulkner's Thomas
Sutpen from Absalom, Absalom! He
creates his own world, develops it
on his own time schedule, and has
what the poet Yeats described as

the monstrous innocence of nature.
He is like Newman and Gatsby in
that his self-absorption buries him
away from reality, but his inno-
cence is of a different sort

Mr. Brooks described it as Yeats
did—a monstrous innocence, like
that of nature, which acts without
'choice, and for itself; whereas,

Gatsby and Newman envision a pla-
tonic existence of more sacrifice.
They do not realize that the world
they have created is apart from
the world of others and cannot be

Campus Politics

As election day approaches, the din of party politics grows :

louder, candidates smile bigger, issues grow foggier, and the
poor befuddled voter becomes more confused than ever.

This issue of the Ring-tum Phi is devoted to the conscien-
tious student—the one who wants to know the issues involved
and the candidates running, the one who refuses to let a blind,
straight-ticket party vote relieve him of the responsibility of

decision.
For that reason, we have

given over almost this entire

issue to the coming elections. We hold no party lines, nor do
we endorse any candidates. We have our preferences, of course,
but above all else we’d like to see the student body making
up its own mind, with all the facts at hand.

We have attempted to cover as thoroughly and as ob-
jectively as possible the developments so far, and to shed
some light on implications of various actions in the future.

The first page contains a comparison of party platforms,
a synopsis of political events leading to the present, a review
of last night’s debates, and a schedule of coming events. On
the second page we present each of the Big Three candidates
and their personal, unedited views.

Here, then, are the candidates and the issues. Examine
them carefully, and judge for yourselves what decisions are

the best ones on Thursday.

   

BROOKS BROWN
Progressive Candidate

 

 

for Student Body Secretary

MALCOLM MORRIS

University Candidate
for Student Body Secretary

Brown, Morris Vie for Post
Of Student Body Secretary

As Progressive Party candidate
for secretary of the student body, I
am running on a ticket that in-
cludes Lamar Lamb for president
and Steve Smith for vice-president
and Dick Kreitler for president of
Fancy Dress. I am not, however,
running against Jim Kulp nor am I
running against Jim DeYoung. I am
competing with Malcolm Morris.
Here, then, is where the issue lies—
not between the two candidates for
president nor between those for
vice-president. The issue is between
the views of Malcolm Morris and
myself. I am, therefore, taking this
time to present to the student body
my specific views on certain essen-
tial issues in order that they may
be compared to those of my op-
ponent.

EC—Student Liaison

First of all, I believe that an
increased liaison between the Ex-
ecutive Committee and the student
body through a system of reporting
and possibly open legislative meet-
ings to permit a more complete in-
surance of accurate representation
of student body opinion in legisla-
tive matters should be investigated.

Secondly, I believe that, through
an emphasis on the personal value
of and need for honor and for an
honor system, the feeling of fear
which shrouds our present system
will be greatly diminished and
hopefully replaced by one of un-
derstanding.

Thirdly, I believe that the use of
alcohol, strictly regulated, at the
Fancy Dress Ball would increase
both attendance and financial sup-
port of that function thus returning
it to its proper place among the tra-
ditions of the University.

IFC Should Be Lauded

Fourthly, the LF.C. should be con-
gratulated and encouraged to con-
tinue its efforts towards an increased
self-government by the students and
its efforts to encourage intellectual
stimulation as manifested in Con-
tact.

Fifthly, freshman representation
on student government committees
should be continued and expanded

(Continued on page 4)

 

One of the greatest problems in
student government during _ this
past year has been a lack of com-
munication ‘between the student
body and the Executive Committee.
This has been a serious impedi-
ment to the effectiveness of the
Executive Committee and has per-
haps hampered its actions as a
truly representative body. Certainly
the twelve men on the Executive
Committee could not produce all the
ideas which are needed to insure
an effective student government.
Just as certainly, student body opin-
ions and ideas are useless unless
they are communicated and made
known.

Communication ‘Must Exist’

As a candidate for Secretary of
the Student Body, I am particularly
concerned with this lack of com-
munication, for I believe that in
order to preserve a representative
and effective student government
this communication must exist. It is
for this reason that Jim Kulp, Jim
DeYoung, and I have included in
our platform proposals specifically
designed to alleviate this problem.

In the first plank of the Univer-
sity Platform we state that the stu-
dent body should be better informed
as to the workings of the honor
system. A major step in this di-
rection would be a more detailed
statement following honor system
violations. This would serve not
only to inform the student body,
but also to prevent accompanying
rumors which distort the functions
and purposes of the honor system.

Platform Plans Discussed

The third plank, dealing with
the creation of Freshman Class of-
ficers, and the fourth plank dealing
with monthly meetings of class of-
ficers are designed to facilitate this
communication. Increased repre
sentation in the Freshman Class,
coupled with the periodic meetings
of all class officers, will constitute
available channels along which ideas
may be effectively communicated
from the individual students to the
Executive Committee.

The fifth plank provides for pub-

for Student Body President

Candidates

In a major campaign it is always
difficult, especially for the candidates
themselves, to keep in mind the
really important considerations of
the elections. Too many times the
platitudinous, non-offensive  plat-
forms and the mechanical aspects of
voter organization take up all the
time and attention, while the really
important considerations of the office
and the real qualifications of the
candidates are unfortunately ig-
nored.

So, for just a moment, I ask you
to put aside fraternal and party con-
siderations—though to a limited de-
gree these are certainly valid con-
siderations—and think with me
about the actual office of President
of the Student Body.

The Constitution provides an out-
line of the duties for the President.
I want to cite them and show how,
in every instance, I will be a better
President than my opponent:

1. “The President shall preside
over all meetings of the Student
Body and the Executive Committee.”
I have spent two years on the EC.
During this time, I have participated
in probably over 80 honor trials. My
opponent has been on the EC one
year. This is my third year as a
student at Washington and Lee;
during this time, I have become ac-
quainted with the workings of near-
ly every organization on campus.
My opponent, in his second year at
W&L, has lived in the relative iso-
lation of the Law School.

2. “He shall appoint all special
committees, subject to the approval
of the EC.” The special committees
are, and should be, almost com-
pletely made up of undergraduate
students—students whom my op-
ponent has no possible way of
knowing. To be sure, it is true that
the EC usually serves a very ac-
tive advisory role in the selection of
committees. But this is an area in
which the President must take
leadership. It is an area in which
I can take leadership, and my op-
ponent cannot possibly do so. Fur-
thermore, I have a wide knowledge
of the Student Body and will be

Experience, W&L Traditions Are Stressed

I wish to take this opportunity to
express my profound appreciation to
the University Party for the confi-
dence they have shown in me by
nominating me as their candidate
for President of the Student Body.
Furthermore, I want to thank each
and every person who has given of
his time and effort on my behalf in
this campaign.

Since coming to this university
two years ago, I have become ac-
quainted with the various activities
on this campus and have tried to
become an integral part of Wash-
ington and Lee. Having served as a
member of the Executive Committee
this year, I have become familiar
with the inner workings of the
Student Government. I feel that this
has given me an insight of all the
duties of student body president—
legislative, executive, and judicial.

Age Is an Asset

As a law student I am older than
many of you, but as a member of
the student body, I find the same
problems which affect you also af-
fect me. Some may claim that these
factors would limit my effectiveness
as President of the Student Body.
I think that they are assets, not lia-
bilities. I hope and think that these
qualifications will help me to exert
a stabilizing influence and a maturi-
ty of judgment to the problems
which will confront us as students
next year.

Washington and Lee has endowed
us with many traditions: an honor
system, conventional dress, and a
speaking tradition. We are the care-
takers of these traditions—not only
for those who have gone before us,
but also for those who will follow
us. It is incumbent upon each of us
to preserve these traditions.

In doing this, we must remain
open to positive, constructive change.
Radical proposals which threaten
the honor system, and conventional
dress, must be rejected. We must not
destroy our heritage.

Chem Library Dedicated

A memorial to a Washington and
Lee student who drowned last year
was presented to the University
Sunday.

The memorial—furnishings for the
Chemistry Department Library—
honors Theodore Thompson, Jr., who
drowned in March, 1963 in the flood-
swollen Maurey River at Goshen
Pass while attempting to ride rapids
of the river in an inner tube.

The memorial was presented by
the University’s chapter of Kappa
Alpha Order of which Thompson
was a member.

Dr. E. S. Gilreath, chairman of
the chemistry department in which
Thompson was a pre-medical major,
called him an “excellent student
with one of the most engaging per-
sonalities I’ve ever known.”

Arthus Broadus, president of Kap-
pa Alpha, presented a plaque for
the chemistry library with the in-
scription: “This room furnished in
memory of Theodore Thompson, Jr.,
65, 1942-1963, by Alpha Chapter,
Kappa Alpha Order.”

Broadus termed Thompson “a
dedicated student of science as well
as a dedicated brother of Kappa
Alpha so it is fitting that we make
this gift, however small, in his
memory.”

Accepting the gift for the Univer-
sity, President Fred C. Cole said it
was his hope that “through this

 

memorial gift many students will
be reminded of the vigor with which
one student approached his study.”

The office of Vice President of the
Student Body is one which demands
a great deal from the student who
holds it. It demands that he serve
as the second officer on the honor
council which is entrusted with
the duty of judging some of his
fellow students. It demands that he
be prepared to fulfill the duties of
the President if this becomes neces-
sary. It gives him the management
of the Student Body Funds, making
him responsible for the disburse-
ments of the student government
and publications.

More Representative EC

However, there is yet a great deal
more which an energetic vice presi-
dent can do on the Executive Com-
mittee. It is the aim of the Pro-
gressive Party to make the EC more
representative, and if I am elected
I will take pains to seek out student
opinion and to express it to the
president and to the entire EC.
Because the president may have too
many other duties to be able to de-
termine student opinion, I believe
that the vice president should accept
this responsibility. With the vice
president making conscious efforts to
refer student thinking to the EC,
this body would become more re-
sponsive to the students in its poli-
cies.

A second duty which I hope to
perform if elected vice president,
is that of student representative to
the faculty and administration, a job
to which the vice president is nor-
mally appointed by the president.
I would take an active part in
bringing student feelings before the
faculty and in representing to the
administration the ideas of the stu-
dent ‘body.

Better Town Relations

A third duty I would undertake
if elected is to help promote better
student-town relations. As treasurer
of the student government, the vice
president can undertake this respon-
sibility naturally, since most deal-
ings between students and town
concern Lexington’s merchants. I
am acquainted with a number of

An Open Letter to the Student

Body:

It is a matter of record that the
character of Washington and Lee is
widely knowned and admired. An
examination of Who’s Who, for in-
stance, shows a high number of
W&L graduates. This leads one to
believe that the preservation of
this character is an essential task
of our student government. The
University Party is offering for
your consideration a slate of candi-
dates—and a platform which rec-
ognizes this preservation as_ their
primary obligation to the Student
Body.

‘For the Preservation of Structure’

The platform which Jim Kulp,
Malcolm Morris and I have drawn
up and endorsed provides specifi-
cally for the preservation of W&L’s
essential character and_ structure.
Furthermore, we allow for a certain
desirable medium of flexibility in
the implementation and expression
of our traditions and attitudes. Each
of us strongly believes in this plat-
form, not because we are candidates
running together, but because it
expresses our own individual ideals.

What will I as Vice-President do
to carry out these ideals? Of course,
my first duty is to replace the Pres-
ident in case of his absence, and to
manage disbursements of Student
Body funds, subject to the approv-
al of the Executive Committee. But
in light of our particular ideals, we
conceive the Vice-President as a
co-ordinator of our proposed Stu-
dent Body Opinion poll. While
I strongly ‘believe that the leg-
islative powers of the Student
Body should remain vested in the
Executive Committee, the opinion of
the Student Body should be known
by the Committee. The Vice-Presi-
dency will ‘thus become an import-
ant co-ordinator between the Ex-
ecutive Committee and the Student
Body. I feel that I can provide this
co-ordination. 1 have represented my
fraternity in the LF.C. for a year,
and I am on the O.D.K. leadership

The following letter was sent to
the editor of the R-t P by Thomas L.
Maynard, Assistant Principal of the
recently formed Prince Edward Free
School Association. The letter is in
recognition of the services of Dr.
Milton Colvin, W&L political science
professor, to the Association.

The Prince Edward Free School
Association was formed last summer
under the leadership of former Vir-
ginia governor Colgate Darden. The
main purpose of the organization is
to provide schooling for the 1700-odd
Negro children who have not been
going to school since the public
schools in Prince Edward County
closed several years ago.

Dr. Colvin has been serving “per-
iodically” as a civics instructor at
the school since its inception this
last fall. He is one of the few teach-
ers there not on a salary. Dr. Col-
vin has made it clear that his par-
ticipation in the Prince Edward
Free School Association was due to
his belief that all American children
should be in school, not to any par-
ticular racial belief.

—The Editor
Dear Sir:

A famous quotation from Robert
E. Lee directs parents to “forget
local animosities; teach your sons
to be Americans.”

Probably one of the most difficult
jobs for any citizen is to guide peo-
ple in the dull cold path of peace-
able acquiescence to laws that how-

 

Letters To The Editor .. .

ever just and however widely ac-
cepted by a democratic majority of
our country, nevertheless may seem
quite foreign to some of these peo-
ple’s years of upbringing and earlier
social culture.

Such a work must eventually fall
to the lot of the leaders of many
of our country’s younger genera-
tion; just such a labor did General
Lee perform; and such must con-
tinue to be the work of others now
and of many yet to come.

With the surging forward intel-
lectually, socially, economically of
the twenty million American Neg-
roes, with the clamoring for fair
treatment (and is it not healthily
American?) by other minority
groups such as our American In-
dians and Latin-Americans through-
out of the land, it behooves all of us
who can, to strive so as to help make
sure that justice and equality of op-
portunity come within reach of all
our fellow citizens.

This letter is written to thank one
of your faculty, Dr. Milton Colvin,
for his generous contribution of time
and energy, together with some fi-
nancial sacrifice, to help us here at
Prince Edward Free School Asso-
ciation in our job to assist the un-
derprivileged on the road to their
American Dream.

And is it not our dream too?!

Sincerely yours,

THOMAS L. MAYNARD
Assistant Principal

It’s a big event for a school with non-subsidized athletics to
conquer a school that is nationally prominent for its superior
athletic teams. The big day for Washington and Lee was
Saturday as the Generals routed the Duke Blue Devils of the
Atlantic Coast Conference, 15-0, in lacrosse. Duke which
is best known this year for its basketball team and as a peren-

9-1 score from Bridgewater College giving the Generals an-
other loss and leaving them still in search of their first collegiate

victory.

Two big innings, the third

and the eighth, accounted for

all of Bridgewater’s runs. In the third only three of the six

runs scored were earned, while a*
home-run in the eighth with two
men on due to walks resulted in
three more earned runs.

Bridgewater collected only six
hits as did the Generals who failed
to group their hits like their op-
ponents did, though. This sad fact
was painfully obvious in the second
inning when W&L had the bases
loaded with only one out and yet
failed to score. According to the sta-
tistics, the Generals left 13 men on
base.

Lyles Hopes for Good Weather

Coach Lyles made no excuse for
the Generals but only hoped that
more favorable weather would allow
him time to jell his young club.
Lyles cited the relief pitching of
frosh Jim Cooper and the infield
play of Dave Kirkpatrick and Mike
Saunders, who accounted for several
good plays in Saturday’s contest.
Wednesday, W&L travels to Lynch-
burg and hopes to start their bats
booming with more frequency and
ferocity.

Baseball Hopes
Lie In Hurlers

Most professional baseball man-
agers agree that pitching is the most
important facet of baseball. You
cannot win games consistently with-
out good pitching.

This year the Generals appear to
be lacking the big power hitters of
last year and thus must count on
the pitching to aid them in the close
low scoring games.

The two southpaws who will prob-
ably bear the brunt of the hurling
load are Chris Wigert, a junior from
Sparta, New Jersey, and Brice
Gamber, a senior from Baltimore.

Wigert was the leading winner on
the staff last year and will prob-
ably retain the number one spot
again. “Dumbo,” as he is affection-
ately called by his teammates, relies
on the usual repertoire of a fast ball,
a curve, and an occasional knuckle-
ball. He throws all three pitches ef-
fectively. Coach Lyles is expecting
a good season from Wigert, who, by
the way, was the leading RBI man
on the team last year.

Gamber is starting his fourth year
of varsity without ever having
come out on the winning side of
the ledger. Gamber has pitched well
enough to win on many occasions,
but does not seem to know what

 

*nial football power, has had many
great lacrosse teams, but this year’s
squad is evidentally not going to
one of those great one.

As for the Generals, they appear to
have one of their strongest teams
in recent seasons. They have de-
feated Hofstra and Duke and lost
to a tough Williams team.

The Duke game remained close
for one quarter, but the Generals
broke it open in the second period
with four goals to give them a 6-0
halftime margin. They added three
goals in the third period and six in
the last stanza to complete the job.

Second Period Splurge

Mike Michaeles and Randy Woot-
ton scored three goals each to pace
the attack. Carroll Klingelhofer
| scored two, plus three assists. Single
goals were tallied by John McDaniel,
Bob Hankey, Pat Robertson, Doug
Morrison. Jay Bowersox, Bob Frost,
and Butch West.

Statistics show the lopsidedness
of the game. The Generals took
73 shots at their host’s goal, while
the Blue Devils managed only 16.
The defense, led by Bill Gossman
and freshmen Ted Leach and Lance
Bendann, either prevented the shots
or just relieved the loser’s attack-
men of the ball. Goalies Pete Noonan
and John Eddy Moore had little
work to do. Noonan made three

Future Of Campus Politics
To Be Determined In Elections

(Continued from page 1)

paigns which play a part in every
W&L election constitute another
hurdle in the path of a Lamb vic-
tory; he must fight against accusa-
tions of radicalism, claims that he
wants to “destroy the Honor Sys-
tem,” and other equally naive, but
nevertheless influential tales.

This is a point Kulp definitely has
over Lamb. In his year and a half at
W&L, he has remained in relative
anonymity beyond the law school.
Little is known of his personal life;
and, except for his statements dur-
ing election time, his position on
issues has been unknown. Thus he
enters the race with a clean slate,
and will win or lose on the basis
of impressions he makes this week.

Lamb and the Freshmen

One of Lamb’s strong points seems
not to be so favorable to him after
all: the freshman class. His ex-
treme popularity with freshmen had
been a sore point with UP leaders.
However, concentrated efforts by Big
Clique houses to indoctrinate the
ideas of straight-party voting seem
to have succeeded. Freshmen, for
the first time since the demise of the
old UP, are thinking in terms of
house dictates.

They have apparently been con-
vinced of the worth of voting
straight party, regardless of candi-
dates.

Another point that has weakened
Lamb with freshmen is insistence by
UP politicians that his friendliness
and receptiveness to them since Sep-
‘tember has been a carefully designed
plot on his part to court their votes
for this election.

De Young and Smith

In the case of the vice presidential
race, Smith and DeYoung are fight-
ing a hard campaign. DeYoung, be-
cause of the huge UP vote majority,
seems to have the edge at present.
Although Smith won the endorse-
ment of the non-fraternity steering
committee, a hand vote of the Inde-
pendents indicated that it is almost
an even split between him and
DeYoung for the non-fraternity fac-
tion.

Malcolm Morris is apparently
running ahead of Brooks Brown by
a comfortable margin. In addition to
the vote majority he enjoys by Big
Clique membership, his support by
the non-fraternity students is al-
most unanimous.

Kreitler Leads FD Race

In the race for Fancy Dress pres-
ident, Kreitler seems to be the most
popular candidate. As with his run-
ning mates, however, he must some-
how surmount the threat of straight-
party balloting by the UP. He and
Adams are both strong with the In-

dependents, with Kreitler probably
taking the lead there.

All in all, the University Party
seems to be in a better position than
the Progressives. They have the
enormous imbalance of party votes
in their favor, and they seem to be
maintaining the party line dictum.
As a UP spokesman put it, “All we
have to do to win this election is
to see that all our boys vote straight
party, regardless of personal feel-
ings or anything else. And we're
doing that.”

lighter penalty might cause greater
temptation to violate the Honor
System.

Continuing, he said, “I thought
for months about the graduated pen-
alty idea before coming to the con-
clusion that it isn’t possible. But

 

while I feel confident that I shall
not return to this idea now that I
have discarded it, I cannot guaran- |
tee that my mind is set, permanent-
ly, on this or any other issue; I
certainly hope my mind ean still
change, in light of new information
and situations. I believe any think-
ing person’s mind is open to change.”

saves, while Moore stopped five
shots.

The outstanding players in the
game were McDaniel and Robertson.
McDaniel recovered 15 ground balls,
which, in layman’s terms, is pick-
ing up loose balls. Robertson re-
covered 11. McDaniel had tough
luck with his shots, but did get a
goal and two assists.

The victory, in short, could be
attributed to ball control. The Gen-
erals had a definite advantage in that
they recovered about 80 per cent of
the ground balls.

The greatest advantage of this
game was that Coach Bob McHenry
was able to insert all of his reserves.
Thus, the freshmen and sophomores
received necessary game experience.

The Generals play hosts to Villa-
nova Saturday. The Wildcats bring

two years, and am presently serving
as President of Kappa Sigma. Among
other things, I was selected out-
standing freshman, played varsity
baseball, and presently hold a schol-
arship.

It is my earnest belief that active
increased student government par-
ticipation in University direction is
the key to a successful future for
Washington and Lee. It is with these
qualifications and toward these ends,

| then, that I intend to work; and, I

do, therefore, submit to you that I
am the most qualified to serve in
this position the best of your in-
terests as a student body.

able fairly and knowledgeably to
lead in the selection of committees.

3. “He shall have the power...
to do anything necessary to promote
the best interest of the Student
Body.” This purposefully vague sec-
tion assumes that the President will
have an accurate idea of just what
the “best interest of the Student
Body” is. But can we assume that
a man who has connection with only
one tenth of the student body can
possibly have any idea of what is
in the best interest of the Student
Body? I, on the other hand, am a
non-fraternity student who is a so-
cial member of a fraternity and a
dorm counselor. Therefore, I have
wide contacts with students and
can be sensitive to the problems and
opinions of the Student Body.

I think that this analysis of ‘the
duties of the office I seek should
show decisively that I am the bet-
ter candidate for the office. I hope
that you have read and studied the
platforms of the two parties. I think
that in the Progressive Party Plat-
form I have expressed ideas which
will make gradual improvements in
our student government while pre-
serving the traditions of our school.

More Open EC

In particular, I am anxious to see
the EC somewhat more open in
legislative matters. To this end, I
have suggested publication of the
votes of members of the BC and

open meetings in which key issues
are to be debated.

The need for open primaries for
choosing freshman EC representa-
tives should be apparent to anyone
who is aware of the usually super-
ficial and completely political meth-
ods presently employed in selection
of nominees. I have also endorsed a
plan of more adequate assimilation
to the Honor System. This plan in-
volves a mock honor trial, and a
program of emphasis on unsystem-
atized aspects of honor.

These and other parts of the plat-
form which Steve, Brooks and I
have published are, I think, indica-
tions of our desire steadily to im-
prove W&L in every possible way,
while preserving the _ traditions
which have made us what we are.

These are the things, I think, which
are important to consider in choos-
ing the Student Body officers. To
be sure, there will be some con-
sideration of fraternal and party
loyalties. But in a larger sense,
there will be consideration of what
is best for Washington and Lee, for
its students and its government. It
is because I think that I can serve
the best interest of Washington and
Lee that I seek your support in
this election.

town officers already and have dis-
cussed with them the possibilities
of better relations, which I believe
would be very profitable for both
sides concerned.

The vice presidency is an office
which can be performed, perhaps,
with little time and effort spent, if
the person in office so chooses. If
I am elected I will not rest on the
minimum duties—I will give the
work which is necessary in order for
your student government to function
really well. Of course the only way
by which students can judge wheth-
er my efforts will be sufficient to
be called an improvement in the EC,
is by looking at the record. There-

 

fore, I sincerely ask that each stu-
dent examine the qualifications and
experience in student activities of
both myself and my opponent.

Progressive Party Platform

My ideas on what a good vice
president must do are explained
here, and my qualifications for the
office may be found on our party
posters. A broader statement of
what I stand for may be found in
the Progressive Party Platform,
which I believe to be the strongest
and the most beneficial platform I
have seen in a Washington and Lee
election.

If you support my plans to be an
active vice president, and if on the
basis of my record you determine
that I have the ability and the de-
sire to do a good job, I hope you
will cast your vote for me when
you vote on Thursday.

positions I have had the opportuni-
ty to represent W&L students.

Elective-Appointive Coordination

Equally important as the above,
however, are my basic feelings to-
ward student government. There
should be a definite co-ordination
between the elective and appointive
positions, for instance, the Executive
Committee and the Student Control
Committee so that the basic policy
of this committee could be definitely
understood and implemented. Fur-
thermore, I suggest that through
this co-ordination the Executive
Committee would be brought closer
to the student body in trying to
carry out the E.C. policies and re-
flecting student opinion.

It is with these ideas in mind
that Jim Kulp, Malcolm Morris, and
I have solidly endorsed each pro-
posal in our platform. A vote for
men holding these ideas is a vote
for a stable student government pre-
serving the ideals that we desire
while allowing for adequate reflec-
tion of student opinion.
