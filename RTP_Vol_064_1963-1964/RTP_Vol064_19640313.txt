Lamb Advises Open EC Meetings

dent body as to just what the EC
is doing, and an inability of the var-
ious members of the EC to take a
poll on issues which confront them.
This is not necessarily catastrophic,
but at times it is unhealthy.

Since at times there is no practi-
cal remedy of the latter situation
(else we would have a Greek polis
and not a representative govern-
ment) perhaps something can be
done about the former.

In short, there is no reason why
legislative sessions of the EC should
not be open to all students. Two
years ago, these meetings were open-
ed to the members of the press, but
they have only sporadically sent re-
porters to the meetings. Students
still have very little idea of either
what the EC does or how well it
does it.

Matters of Interest

I have no illusions as how well at-
tended these meetings would be—
very few students would come. But

 

there are a few occasions when ser-
ious matters are being debated, and
it is at these times when both the
EC and the student body would
benefit from open meetings. People
interested in such things as the var-
ious committees’ functions, the prog-
ress of the Mock Convention, or
student body fund allocation would
greatly profit from attendance at
EC meetings. When debate on such
matters is scheduled, students could
be notified of time, so they could

come, observe, and perhaps con-
tribute from the floor.
This should in no way, however,

interfere with the secrecy of honor
trials, for obvious reasons. But there
is no reason why legislative meet-
ings should not be open to any stu-
dent who is interested in coming.
If nothing else it would help them
in knowing whom to vote for in
Spring elections—they would be
more thoroughly acquainted with
both issues and abilities and opin-
ions of members of the EC.

 

Appeasement Policies Blasted

later he offered a ‘negotiated freeze’
on delivery systems.” (Emphasis
added.)

On the other hand, we find in a
booklet published by The Center For
Strategic Studies at Georgetown
University that “the Soviet leader-
ship, both political and military, has
reached a working consensus on the
need to support a policy of detente
as a strategic course of action.”

After stating Soviet goals,
the article proceeds: “Premier

Khrushchev may regard these
goals as possible phases or incre-
mental steps in a single strategy,
whereby further economic growth

would serve as a step toward the
attainment of strategic parity, and

strategic parity would serve as a

necessary step toward strategic
supremacy.”
Different policy goals must

inevitably be the products of these
divergent analyses. The goal of those
who share the first and in whose
breast “hope springs eternal” is to
seek a workable relationship be-
tween communism and the free
world that will preserve peace in
a “world safe for diversity.”

Contrast the goal proceeding
from the second—victory over
communism through concerted po-
litical, economic, psychological, and
subversive efforts. A global stategy
designed to diminish the Soviet
power base and challenge com-
munist aggressions on all fronts.
To these men peace without vic-
tory is a dangerous illusion,

It is in this context that the spe-
cific proposals, or lack of them,
from aspirants for public office
from both parties take on meaning
and must be understood.

legian, but is only citing the detri-
ment that the publication in its
present state has been to the name
of the University and the much more
clever humor of which the students
here are capable. Blunt grossities, he
feels, are less funny than well-
written satire and subtle humor.

 

Editor Defends Collegian

The attempt to remove the school’s
support from the Collegian, however,
is expected to be unpopular with
the student body. Collegian editor,
Tain Tompkins, who, as a member
of the Publications Board, has been
aware for some time of the endang-
ered position in which the Collegian
has been put, spoke up in favor of
the publication when interviewed
yesterday.

Tompkins admitted that Dean At-
wood’s criticisms were excellent and
that Wootton had a point, but said,
“I wouldn’t undertake to edit it if
I didn’t think it was worth defend-
ing.’ He stated that he could not
disagree with some of the criticisms
but was strongly opposed to this
action which would possibly mean
the end of the Collegian.

To bring an end to the Collegian,
he said, would be bringing to an
end the most popular of the campus
publications. He pointed out that
the Collegian ranks as one of the
oldest and most famous college hu-
mor magazines, and despite present
events, is enthusiastically accepted
by the substantial majority of stu-
dents,

The Collegian is well budgeted for
the remainder of this year, but

would be forced to rely on subserip-
tion sales if the University denied
it a sanction to collect as it does
now. Whether it will survive or not
is ultimately, according to Tomp-
kins, a test of popularity.

Goldwyn’s Talk Slammed

with every major cliche imagin-
able—love, sex, pregnancy, abor-
tion, the draft, and some almost
dead college slang.

 

At his lecture, someone asked Mr.
Goldwyn who was responsible for
the photography in his picture. He
said, in effect, that the final re-
sponsibility was his, but that often
such decisions were left to tthe di-
rector of photography. As the pho-
tography was really the only nice
thing about the film I feel quite
safe in assuming the credit for this
goes to the director of photography
and not to Mr. Goldwyn. Despite
his unusually good intentions, the
feeling that one has on leaving the

film is that Mr. Goldwyn lacks
imagination, talent, and insight. As
for Mr. Garrett, he should be
ashamed.

With Easter vacation already flashing the “Walk” sign, why not
decide before you go home on your number one suit and the rest of
your wardrobe. Aside from the traditional dress-up holiday, there
may be decisive interviews for either a summer job or a permanent
one if you're a graduating senior—-and the clothes you wear—plus
the way that you wear them—make the pivotal first impression.
You want it to be right at first sight, so, let’s take a run-down on
what you might well select this Spring in fashion.

YOUR NUMBER ONE SUIT for warmer

weather is next to weightless in the new lighter-
than-ever flannels and polyester/wool blends.
Color-wise, consider the more definite blues, the
new lighter greys; see the classic Glen Urquhart
or ‘glen’ plaids.

THE GIFT OF ‘GAB’ you get with the return of

natural tan gabardine. Its fine diagonal twill
weave and surface sheen make it an excellent
choice for your Number One Suit. Today’s gab-
ardines also come in lighter weight wools and
new polyester/wool blends.

 

PRIDE OF THE OUTFIT: REGIMENTAL

STRIPES ... the resurgence noted by ESQUIRE
last fall is gaining momentum for Regimental
Stripes—the traditional colors of the historic

oe British regiments. With scores of these famed
x oo regiments—like the Grenadier Guards, the
Royal Fusiliers, the Inskilling Dragoons—
there’s quite a roll-call of striking color com-
binations in pure silk repps for your selection.

DRESS SHIRTS—-SHOES—BELT . White Button Down Oxfords

are still very much de rigeur, and there are handsome variations in
narrow tape stripes of blue, grey, olive. Also, although you ‘can’t
go wrong’ with a white broadcloth tab collar dress shirt, why not
dress up with the newest pale tones of blue, olive or cream. With
suits in Blue or Grey, wear BLACK SHOES or the VERY DARK:
EST BROWNS...and RIB SOCKS are always smart and correct.
Your DRESS BELT is LEATHER with an important har ness- -type
buckle in polished metal.

AT THE SUMMIT—YOUR HAT... where the
decisions are made, it’s the narrow snap-brim
felt in brown or olive—welt edge, raw edge or
grosgrain-bound.

BIG SWEATER ON CAMPUS—THE CARDIGAN .... the button-

front coat-sweater is tops in campus popularity. Tops in favor are
the lofty Shetland and the open-knit Alpaca wool or wool blends in
solid colors or stripes.

BEACH- eounO! Should your vacation find you beached around

Ft. Lauderdale or Bermuda, say, then sports-
wear moves into number one spot. Here you'll
see a lot of TIGER—the bold, tawny color that’s
getting the roar of approval from campus men
everywhere. They pick it up in sportshirts like
this, sweaters, ties, socks. Find it in sharp, solid
tones or mixed—for example, a houndstooth
sportcoat checked in Black and Tiger... and let
them see you “burning bright” in fashion.

Membership Boost

Gets IFC A

In its weekly meeting Monday
night the IFC voted to increase
membership from two to three men
per house. The motion for the in-
crease received the necessary two-
thirds vote, and passage next week
by the same margin will make it a
part of the newly adopted IFC
Constitution.

The three members to represent
each house will consist of the house
president and two other members,
elected for a full year. These two
members must not be in the same
class. This will bring the total mem-
bership of the council to fifty-four.

According to IFC President Art
Broadus, the motion was made be-
cause of the increase in number of
officers required by the new con-
stitution and also to supply more
men for committee work on various
IFC committees.

Exchange Program

Freddie Cooper, IFC vice presi-
dent, reported that he has spoken
to members of the Chamber of
Commerce concerning a program
whereby fraternity men and men
of the various Lexington organiza-
tions can meet and talk with each
other. A motion was made and
passed that the IFC sponsor an
exchange-type program with the
various clubs in order to improve
relationships between students and
local residents. In the near future
fraternity men will begin eating with
such local organizations as the Lions
Club and then men from _ these
groups will return the visits and
eat in various fraternity houses.

Blaine Brownell, a Kappa Sig
junior, was elected chairman of the
projected IFC weekend to be held
in the spring of 1965. He will be
in charge of selecting a theme and

Rockefeller Leader Speaks Here
At Meeting Of State Chairmen

By BILLY CANNON

Marshall Coleman, chairman of
Young Southerners For Rockefeller,
spoke before a meeting of the State
Chairmen of W&L’s upcoming Mock
Convention last night and empha-
sized the importance of the local
convention while dodging questions
concerning the Governor’s third
place finish in his neighboring state
of New Hampshire’s recent primary.

Coleman, a senior law student at
Virginia, has been closely connected

with the governor and has done a
great deal of campaigning for him
in the South.

“New Hampshire presented a bad
situation,” said Coleman. “The re-
sults were indecisive, but I feel it
was a_ great victory for the mod-
erate candidates of which I classify
Governor Rockefeller a member.”

Replying to Bill Burke, chairman
of the Goldwater in ’64 Committee,
Coleman commented, “I consider
Rockefeller a moderate because he

 

 

Glee Club Plans Program
With R-M For March 22

By GENE HATFIELD

The Washington and Lee Glee
Club joins the Randolph-Macon
Chorus Sunday night, March 22, for
a Palm Sunday concert. The per-
formance will begin at 8 p.m. in the
Randolph-Macon auditorium.

Featured will be Johann Sebastian
Bach’s Christ Lay in Death’s Dark
Prison Cantata No. 4, performed by
both groups. In addition, the W&L
glee club will present selections
from Antonio Vivaldi’s Gloria mass,
Handel’s “Now Let Every Tongue
Adore Thee” and Bach’s “Hallelu-
jah, Amen.” Baritone Bill Supon will
be the soloist on the Gloria selec-
tion.

In preparation for the concert,
the glee club rehearses in Lynch-
burg Monday night, and Randolph-
Macon Chorus travels to Lexing-
ton for rehearsal Wednesday night.

The same program will be pre-
sented Tuesday night, March 24, at
the Lexington Presbyterian Church.

This afternoon the glee club sings
for Lexington High School in an
afternoon appearance. Still on the

agenda for the glee club this spring
are two joint concerts with the
Longwood Chorus. One will be n
the Longwood campus and one will
be the glee club’s annual perform-
ance for the Southern Interscholas-
tic Press Association. This will con-
clude the glee club’s schedule for
the year.

The glee Club has just returned
from a tour of Philadelphia and sur-
rounding area. Performances were
given at the Shriner’s Hospital for
crippled children in Philadelphia,
the Tatnall Preparatory School in
Wilmington, Delaware, and Beaver
College in Philadelphia. The latter
was a joint concert with the Beaver
Chorus.

Mr. Robert Stewart, the club’s di-
rector, expressed satisfaction over
the performance of the glee club on
the tour. Tentative arrangements
were made for a visit by the Beaver
College Chorus to Lexington next
Spring.

The trip was sponsored by the
newly-formed Philadelphia alumni
group.

 

 

“Unsubsidized ‘Collegian’ Will Fold’
Indicated In Student Opinion Survey

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Should the Southern Collegian
continue to receive University
subsidy, or does it no longer play a
vital role in the campus life of
W&L?

A resolution to withdraw Univer-
sity support from the University
humor magazine is presently be-
fore the EC and will be acted upon
shortly. The action was initiated by
Dean Atwood, Dean of Students.

In a student survey taken this
week, the majority of those ques-
tioned seemed to feel that the Col-
legian would fold if University sup-
port is withdrawn, If the school
were to take away its subsidy, stu-
dents commented, the Southern Col-
legian would have to rely on sub-
seription for its existence, and sub-
scription might prove to be inade-
quate.

A law student pointed to the case
of UVa.’s humor magazine. This
publication was cast out of the uni-
versity fold in 1958 and collapsed
the following year of financial prob-
lems.

Many Endorsers

There is a large number of stu-
dents which endorse the Collegian
as it is and disagrees that its “off-
color” humor hurts the University

image or the magazine’s quality.

 

This group feels that a humor mag-
azine like the Collegian occupies an
important place in the University
life, and it does not feel that it is
necessary for the magazine to serve
an educational purpose to make it
a worthwhile campus institution. A
sophomore pointed out that the
Presbyterian Davidson College spon-
sors a similar magazine, Scripts and
Patches, and wondered why non-

denominational W&L should be
“more prudish” than a_ parochial
school,

A number of students were “qual-
ified” supports of the Southern Col-
legian. Some students indicated that
they personally think the magazine
amusing and so do their dates, but
they wouldn’t show it to their par-
ents. One person admitted that it
doesn’t matter to him whether the
Collegian is “clean” or not, but
“the humor should be more subtle

and varied—the article by the Hol-

lins girls was good, for instance.
Collegian Enemies

One junior that supports with-
drawal of University funds from the
magazine stated that he felt that
losing the Collegian in its present
form would be no great loss to the
student body. Another student re-
marked that the magazine would be
much better and could be more

“gross” if it were not connected
with the University.

Perhaps the foremost student sup-
porter of Dean Atwood’s proposal is
Phi Delt senior Randy Wootton. His
reasoning, and that of most of the
proposal’s supporters goes as fol-
lows:

“It is granted that the Southern
Collegian is acceptable to the ma-
jority of W&L students and to its
subscribers; however, it is generally
offensive to many dates, parents of
students and dates, and to some of
the faculty and administration staff
at Washington and Lee.

“It is felt that the gross and
shocking “humor” which makes the
magazine offensive to this latter

group is due to one main reason—
the income of the Collegian is as-
sured. The editors do not have to
strive for perfection in order to
keep the magazine going.
Offensiveness Serious

| “It is contended by those support-
ing Dean Atwood’s resolution, that
the problem of Collegian offensive-
ness is sufficiently serious to re-
quire some action.

“If the Collegian were to be taken
off school subsidy and placed on a
subscription basis, a limited number
of copies would be issued. A sub-

(Continued on page 4)

 

 

has been able to initiate social leg-
islation in New York while balanc-
ing the budget. The Governor has
repeatedly called for more state’s
rights and state’s responsibilities.”

“His record is striking,’ noted
Coleman, calling to attention the
Governor’s victory in New York in
1958. “He won in a large and crucial
state at a time when the Democrats
were sweeping the country by beat-
ing an incumbent by 50,000 votes.
The experts considered it impossible.

Turning to the Republican Party,
the UVa. student body president
emphasized, that “the hard core
Republicans, meeting in San Fran-
cisco ,will be looking for a candi-
date who can run a good race.
Johnson’s great strength in the
South must be offset by a man who
can win in the Northeast and in-
dustrial states.”

“As evidenced in 1960 it takes a
powerful political machine to win
the presidency. I consider Rocke-
feller’s the strongest in history with
the exception of possibly Senator
Kennedy’s.”

Burke, who threw the bulk of the
questions at Coleman, felt that “if
Rockefeller can’t win in New Hamp-
shire, where can he win?”

“Goldwater, as a foreigner to the
New England region, finished num-
ber 2,” said Burke, “I believe he’ll
receive a great deal more support
in Oregon and California.”

Local chairman Steve Hibbard, of
the Rockefeller for President cam-
paign refuted Burke saying, “From
actual appearance Rocky didn’t gain
ground in New Hampshire, but in
the fact that Goldwater talked of
getting 60 per cent of the vote and
then successively dropped his pre-
piction to as low as 35 per cent,
while finally polling 23 per cent,
Rockefeller did make substantial
gains in picking up ground on Gold-
water. It is a fallacy to say ‘What’s
going to happen if Rockefeller can’t
win next door.’ It must be realized
that Lodge was a favorite son can-
didate and New Hampshire is a
conservative state. Goldwater should
have shown strength.

“Evidence from all the pools taken
show that Lodge seriously detracted
from votes. If it had been a two-
man race, Rockefeller would have
won.”

The student _ political
agreed on three points.

1. The real test of strength will
come in the California primary June

2. Washington and Lee’s conven-
tion has taken on untold strength
since the indecisive results in New
Hampshire prove pratically noth-
ing.

3. The contest will boil down to
a two man race for the nomination
unless a third force should sweep
California.

Hibbard conceded, “Governor
Rockefeller is going to get an out-

leaders

and-out victory in California.
Rockefeller hoped to have most of
the state’s delegates pledged be-

fore the primary. He hasn't gotten
the delegates committe, but they are
against Goldwater.”

John A. Wells, New York chair-
man of the Rocky machine, told a
New York audience last week that
“the three most important victories
Governor Rockefeller needs are the
New Hampshire Primary, the Cal-
ifornia contest, and Washington and
Lee’s Mock Convention.

Rockefeller lost in New Hamp-

Peterson Speaks
On Free Economy

Last Tuesday afternoon Dr. Wil-
liam H. Peterson, distinguished au-
thor and business book editor of the
Wall Street Journal spoke to the
Conservative Society on the impor-
tance of free enterprise.

A native of Princeton, New Jersey,
Dr. Peterson wrote The Great Farm
Problem, which was published in
1959. Besides writing this book, he
has published articles in many dif-
ferent magazines and serves as an
associate professor of economics at
Princeton.

In his lecture, Dr. Peterson stated
that our Constitution is not only a
legal document but also an economic
document. He believes that free
enterprise should govern the econ-
omy exclusive of State intervention
since the purpose of the constitu-
tion is to limit and diffuse the pow-
er of the State.

Then he turned his attention to
the problem of poverty and used as
an example Harlan County, Ken-
tucky, the poorest county in Amer-
ica. In Harlan County, he stated
that a majority of the families had
cars, electricity, and other modern
conveniences in camparison with all
other countries, the conditions of
Harlan County were good.

Although by American standards
Harlan County is in poor economic
condition, he mentioned that pov-
erty is relative. He stated that Har-
lan County’s favorable comparison
with other countries is a tribute to
our free enterprise system.

Next Dr. Peterson discussed the
problem of unemployment. He
stated that unemployment was not
caused by the free market system
but on the contrary by government
intervention.

He stated that the three main
causes of unemployment are: un-
employment compensation, the min-
imum wage, and the labor union
monopolies.

In addition Dr. Peterson presented
his theory of the market place in
which the consumer is the most im-
portant. He stated that the cor-
poration is at the mercy of the
American consumer.

 

State Delegations Named

Lists of the state delegations for
the 1964 Mock Republican Con-
vention are posted on campus.
Assignments to the state delega-
tions were made on the basis of
requests by the state chairmen,
the resident state of the indiviv-
ual student, and, in an effort to
fill the delegations of those states
with new representatives in the
student body and those states with
a large number of delegates, many
asignment were made at random,

Five Named For
Wilson#A wards

Five Washington and Lee University seniors were ap-
pointed Woodrow Wilson Fellows for graduate study next fall.
In addition two students were given honorary mention although
they did not qualify as fellows. Those chosen as Fellows are

A. Kell, Edward N. Norton,
W. Wright. James W. Ramsey,

*Jr., and Meredith N. Weaver, Jr.,

received honorary mention,

The Washington and Lee winners
are among 1507 throughout the
United States and Canada selected
from 11,000 applicants. Candidates
must be nominated by faculty mem-
bers and are carefully screened by
regional and national selection com-
mittees.

Eckes, a member of LXA, has
served on the student control com-
mittee and has captained the debate
team. He is a history major and a
consistent honor roll student and
member of Phi Beta Kappa and
Omicron Delta Kappa.

Kell, also a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, has served on the Univer-
sity Christian Association, Concert
Guild, ReVue, and Graham-Lee So-
ciety. He has also been track co-
captain and an intramural official.
Kell is a philosophy major and has
frequently made the honor roll.

Edward M. Morton, SAE, has par-
ticipated on the debate team, swim-
ming team, and is now participating
in Mock Convention. He is a history
major.

Supak, ZBT, is presently vice
president of the student body and
has served on the Dance Board and
basketball team. He is a fine arts
major, has frequently appeared on
the honor roll, and has already
received the Elizabeth Barret Schol-
arship.

The final winner, Wright, current
secretary of the student body, has
also served as a dorm counselor.
He is a member of Phi Beta Kap-
pa, Omicron Delta Kappa, and Phi
Eta Sigma.

The Woodrow Wilson Fellowship
grants its fellows full tuition and
fees for the first year at the gradu-
ate school of their choice as well as
a living stipend of $1,800.

In accepting a Woodrow Wilson
Fellowship, the candidate assumes
a moral obligation to complete at
least one year of graduate studies
and to give serious thought to a
career in teaching.

A Fellow is supported for one
academic year of two semesters, two
trimester, or three quarters, even
though his graduate school requires
more time for the completion of the
M.A. degree. Traveling expenses
and books are paid for from the
Fellow’s living allowance. The
Woodrow Wilson program aims to
help students earn a doctorate as
soon as possible, and so the Fellow
assumes an obligation to make rea-
sonably sure of getting his own
support beyond the first graduate
year.

A fellow may not hold any other
fellowship at the same time as he
holds the Woodrow Wilson. While
the Foundation does not support
Fellows beyond the first year of
graduate study, it sends subventions
to graduate schools at which Wood-
row Wilson Fellows are enrolled,
and this money may be available for
the support of graduate students be-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che King-tum Phi

Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

: The Southern Collegian

W&L has once again joined the bandwagon. While the
nation passes judgment on the respective cases of Baker,
Hoffa, Ruby, etc., the University has spotlighted a moral issue
all its own: the Southern Collegian. Several weeks ago, under
mounting pressure of anti-Collegian criticism, the Dean of
Students appointed himself initially as the prosecutor of the
University subsidized humor magazine. In the end, neverthe-
less, it will be the student body that must decide the fate of
the publication.

The fallacy of bringing the Collegian to a student plebiscite,
however, is this: the magazine does have mass appeal, in the
same way that the idea of University-subsidized contraceptives
or women in the dorms (try bringing those to a plebiscite!)
would have mass appeal. For this reason, critics do not doubt
that the Collegian may be somewhat popular; what they con-
demn is the means to which the magazine, because of a weak
staff and lack of talent, must continually resort in order to re-
tain this popularity. Thus, if this spring we are called on to
judge the merits of the Collegian as a University publication,
some touchstone other than “‘popularity’”’ should be the basis

of the final verdict.

 

Sellers Plays US President

In Kubrick’s

By BOB MOTTLEY
Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strange-
love or: How I Learned To Stop
Worrying and Love the Bomb is cur-
rently showing in Lynchburg and
deserves comment

for those who
want to give an
unusually ma-

cabre twist to an
evening at Macon.
This film is a
horror - comedy
that satirizes man-
kind’s ridiculous
life-and-death af-

   

"9 fair with the

Bomb. Strange-

Rtetiiny love is a brilliant,
edifying, shatteringly hilarious

movie that will keep you roaring
until the rug is pulled up and
neatly folded at the end. Its plot
in a nutshell: a crazed U.S. Air Force
general instructs his trigger-itchy
SAC bomber crews to attack Rus-
sia, without the knowledge or per-
mission of the American President
(a pleasant loser superbly portrayed
by Peter Sellers.)

Sellers also plays Dr. Strangelove,
a former German national who is
now the U.S. weapon specialist.
(I don’t want to spoil all of the
jokes, but the general’s reason for
attacking Russia is to annihilate the
“International Communist Conspi-
racy” which he suspects of pollut-
ing the stout Birch trees of the
West with flourides, contaminating
“all of natural bodily fluids.” Also,
the chief positive thinker among the
high flying bomber pilots is a Tex-
an named Slim Pickens—just what
will be left afterwards.)

When the news of the general's
action reaches the U.S. command
post, there is a certain amount of
consternation. Everything possible
is done to recall the bombers, with
the obvious result that one plane
easily manages to slip through the
bungling. Its bombs merily drop,
and lo—the Russians have a sur-
prise up their Cossack sleeves—a
“Doomsday Device” that is timed to
to go off whenever so much as one
acre of Soviet soil is vaporized.

Since Strangelove wasn’t playing
penney-ante, there is sufficient fur
flying to set off this Fateful ma-
chine, and it gleefully commences
a series of world-crisping explo-
sions. As the movie ends, the screen
billows with thermonuclear clouds
and a seductive female voice purrs:
“We'll meet again, don't know
where, don’t know when, but I
know we'll meet again some sunny
day.”

 

‘Strangelove’

The Absurd

Stanley Kubrick has accomplish-
ed at least one very significant
thing in this film: he has enabled
us to laugh at the most absurd
fears of our generation. The danger
joked about IS real, of course, and
Dr. Strangelove might not seem so
funny after a nuclear holocaust, but
for the present it serves as a long
needed tonic to shatter the “Bomb
psychosis” of recent years. Every-
one—the President, the Air Force
General, “Slim Pickins,” the USSR
premier, is made to appear so ridic-
lous that the American government
seems to be in the hands of the
Three Stooges and the Russian gov-
ernment in the clutches of the
Marx brothers—-Groucho, Harpo,
Chico, and Karl. The moral? Nu-
clear war is patently absurd. Why
not get a good laugh out of it be-
fore (1) it happens or (2) it be-
comes a snow of yesteryear? So,
strangelovely enough, man’s most
desperate fear becomes a crackling
shuttlecock for comedy, a hand
grenade tossed from friend to foe—
until—har-de-har-har—Bang!

There is genius as well as method
in this apparent madness, and Ku-
brick deserves just about every ac-
ecolade in the book. He has made
a “hot war” so laughable that only
morons could possibly indulge in it.
This is ultimately, what worries the
viewer between guffaws. Have we
morons in High Places? Of course
not, cackle, cackle. Still considering
the bottomless human capacity for
stupidity. ...

(If you should be caught in New
York in a red alert over Spring
vacation, I suggest the following
procedure: down a_ few bloody
Marys and run (do not walk) to
the nearest showing of Dr. Strange-
love. There could be no more ironi-
cal way to bow out.)

While on the subject of stupidity,
we might note that many individuals
in America have their heads wedged
firmly, either in sand or elsewhere.
They include: Goldwaterites, racists,
Old South idolizers, film critics
who don’t know what they are talk-
in about (present company except-
ed, thank you), superpatriots, con-
servatives, Republicans in general,
users of electrical toothbrushes, cer-
tain professors better left unnamed
(you fill in your on preferences),
“great guys,’ segregationists, most
Hollywood producers, and again lo-
cally, those so obsessed with illusions
of honor that they fail to see the
shirt being ripped from their own
backs.

At first glance Lodge’s im-
pressive victory in the New
Hampshire primary (35.4 of
the votes via a write in cam-
paign) would seem to indicate
that Lodge will be a formidable

candidate at the summer conven-
tion, for the Republican primary
winner in New Hampshire has even-
tually become the presidential nom-
inee in every instance except one

 

since the turn of the century. How
ever, most Republican party leaders
are denying Lodge’s chance for
nomination and stating that Scran-
ton and Nixon are now the fore-
runners,

Lodge’s problem is somewhat anal-
ogous to that of the late Estes Ke-
fauver who won the New Hampshire
primary in 1952 but because of his
unpopularity with the party leaders
could never gain the nomination.
Republicans have complained about
Lodge’s lackadasical campaigning in

the past, and his refusal to cooperate
with state chairmen campaigning

fusal to attend parades when he
didn’t feel like doing so. Moreover,
Lodge probably cannot be counted

1960 he promised if elected to have

The Ring-tum Phi
Friday Edition
Dear Sirs:

I object to your article last week
by N. E. Personne for two reasons.
First it was not signed, and second
I do not see how that kind of hu-
mor can lead to any but harmful
results.

With regards to my first complaint,
I feel that it is quite cowardly to
attack a man publicly while hiding
behind the shield of a pen name. I
presume that the author was afraid
to put his name in print because the
doctor might strike back. The only
possible way he could hurt N. E.
is medically, and I am certain the
author would not visit the doctor.
believing him to be dangerous.

What did the author hope to gain
by this kind of slander? If there
was a deeper purpose beyond being
humorous, I imagine it was either
to increase the competence of the
doctor or to have him replaced.
Such an attack might result in the
doctor’s loss of self-confidence—
making him worse. If the object
were to fire him, I believe that the
unfairness of the article will cause
the administration to condemn the
student rather than the doctor.

If the author truly feels the doc-
tor is incompetent, and that meas-
ures should be taken to protect the
students from him, why does he
not attack the problem in an orderly
and fair manner? He should make
some real investigations and find out
if the doctor truly is a hazard. If

 

he then has some real proof, it
should be submitted to the adminis-
tration or the paper. If no reaction
results, then he might resort to
satire.

BOB FUSSELL

Deplorable Situation
Exists On Campus

Dear Sirs:

I am really surprised that after
this deplorable chain of events no
one has taken the initiative to
speak out about this matter. A sit-
uation exists right now on this
campus which presently is more
urgent than the question of inte-
gration or moral depravity.

One young man complained to
the school physician of a constant
and throbbing pain in his abdomen;
he was cursorly examined and dis-
missed with the diagnosis of
stomach gas. Realizing that this
pain was more than gas, the student
walked to the hospital and was op-
erated on within several hours for
an emergency apendectomy.

Another student complained of|
feeling weak and at times extremely
dizzy. He did not feel that he would
be able to take his exams. The school
physician again dismissed his sym-
toms as minor, and refused to ex-
cuse this individual from exams.
Following the exam period, this stu-
dent ventured home to his own
physician and was found to be suf-
fering from mononucleosis.

Letters Discuss Physician, ‘Collegian’

Yet another student suffered a
serious injury in an athletic con-
test and asked to be excused from
classes because of the unbearable
pain. He too was dismissed with
minor medication, and refused ab-
sence from classes. Venturing ‘to the
hospital on his own, this young man
was persuaded to remain as a pa-
tient for at least a week, or risk
a serious operation.

A student from a neighboring un-
iversity was badly cut in a fall here
during Fancy Dress. Taken to
Stonewall Jackson Hospital he was
bandaged by the night nurse and
urged to return the next morning
when a doctor would be on duty. On
returning, still no doctor, this gen-
tleman was urged to go to the Uni-
versity Infirmary for treatment by
the school physician. There he was
not only refused treatment by the
head nurse, but the bleeding young
man was chastised for questioning
school policy. This student was
forced to return to his own campus
for treatment and is still taking pen-
ecillin injections for the infection
which followed his unattended
wound.

These are but a few cases among
many which could be cited. The
students of this university are en-
titled to competent and reliable diag-
nosis and medical care. Under the
present situation, neither is possible.

Before further improving the
physical plant, integrating, or seek-
ing foundation grants, I suggest that
something constructive be done
about the medical staff of this uni-
versity.

Lodge Victory Hurts Barry & Rocky;
Nixon & Scranton Chances Boosted

the defeat of Rockefeller and Gold-
water seriously impair their chances
for victory. Goldwater stated that if
he procured less than 35 per cent
of the vote it would be disastrous—
he received 23 per cent of the vote.
(His campaign manager was more
conservative when he put the figure
at 30 per cent). In any case Gold-
water’s reactionary political ideology
(such as his views on social security
and “shoot from the hip” foreign
policy) proved unacceptable even to
a conservatively inclined electorate.

Rockefeller

On the other hand Rockefeller
was no more acceptable to the pub-
lic, polling 20.6 per cent of the vote.
Most agree that Lodge’s write in
vote hurt Rockefeller more than
Goldwater; however, Rockefeller’s
prime problem continues to be his
untimely divorcee and remarriage
after 30 years of matrimony. Rocke-
feller used all types of campaigns to
combat this, ranging from explana-
tory pamplets to frequently appear-
ing with his new wife; however, the
moral implications of his remarriage
could not be overwhelmed.

Nixon and Scranton

Having discounted the candidates
placing first, second, and third as
strong contenders for the nomina-
tion, Nixon and Scranton, who fin-
ished fourth and eighth respectively,
have increased their possibility of
nomination. Nixon, who managed to
receive over 49 per cent of the popu-
lar vote against Kennedy, has been
considered a strong contender ever
since Kennedy’s assassination, and in
recent months Scranton, who is con-
sidered a middle of the road politi-
cian, has been considered as a com-
promise candidate.

Nothing to Lose

Scranton, however, has been in-
sistent in claiming that he is not a
contender. His claims might very
well be true, for Scranton who is
still in his 40’s might feel he has
a better chance in a later election
than against the very popular John-
son. This leaves one man—former
vice president Nixon. Nixon has
nothing to lose and everything to
gain by running. This will probably
be his last chance to grab the nom-
ination; he has no chance for an-
other political office and will prob-
ably lose most of his popularity in
the coming years. Moreover, the
Republican party, by running Nix-
on, will not destroy a politician who
might have a_ brighter political
chance in the future.

 

Baur Itemizes
Spring Itinerary

By DREW BAUR
Friday Columnist

Truely, Rod Cockshutt, spring is
coming. Since no one else has as yet
reiterated the general happening of
spring, it may as well be now as
later.

The school anxiously awaits:
spring vacation in Nassau, Florida,
Bermuda, and Ft. Bragg; the Begin-
ing of the Goshen teams; Sunday
afternoon townie dates at Twin
Falls; the annual fun and games of
the freshman riots (Princeton out-
did us last year); the assault from
UVa. during Springs Weekend;
everyone complaining about the
Saturday quizzes of Springs Week-
end; Washington University monop-
olizing the spring CAC tournament;
attacks from rather expected and
unexpected sources on everything
from virginity to groundskeeping;
the coming of the Mock Convention
(or the second of a series of visits
by Miss Doreas Campbell); the
kegs and combos of Election Week;
full jails in Lexington and B.V,;
handing in term papers a week late;
settling down for exams; two
weeks of exams and flicks; a grin on
Ed Side’s face; a grin on another
Ed’s face; 1,000 official SIPA guides;
Finals; burying of hatchets for grad-
uation; resurrection of hatchets
when grades come out; but then
you’re home. Spring sprung.

P.E.

In addition to the joys of spring,
freshmen are quite lucky in having
the pleasure of participating in the
second physical fitness test of their
first year. It certainly is a shame
that the rest of the student body
along with faculty and alumni
could not join them in the 1964
jock rating,

Bridgewater;

Track Season Promising

BY JOHNNY GRAHAM
If Wednesday night can be used as a barometer for
coming events, the Washington and Lee 1964 track team
should have a very successful season.

The Generals took seven of

12 individual events, and used

superior depth to put out a 63- 35 win over Bridgewater College

at the VMI field house.

Once more it was the Kell sissias|
ers, Robin and Chris, who led |
way with four firsts between them.

Chris won the 60-yard dash in|
6.4 seconds, and fought a strong |
challenge in ‘the last 20 yards of the|
500-yard dash to take it in 63.8 |
seconds.

Robin won his specialty, the triple |
jump, with a leap of 41’ 3 3/4”, and |
also took the high jump at 5’ 8”. He!
moved the bar immediately to 6’ 2”
to try for the record, but failed on
three successive attempts. He also}
took second in the high hurdles.

The big victory of the evening
came in the shot put where Gay
Gasque got off a toss of 46’ 9 1/2”,
to win the event. His throw breaks
the W&L record of 45’ 8” set by A
B. Platt in 1957, but is unofficial
because it was done indoors.

The Generals’ other two firsts}
came on Johnny Graham’s 12’ jump}
to win the pole vault, and Riff
O’Connor’s victory in the 2-mile
run.

W&L added to its point total with
seconds by Andy Kilpatrick in the
mile, Jim Stalnaker in the ‘road
jump, Gordon Gay in the pole vault,
Spencer Atwater in the low hurdles |
and Jim Thompson in the 880. The
Generals also took all but two of
the third places.

Head track coach Norman Lord
is looking forward to a successful
season. Stating before ‘the season
that he needed “at least 75 bodies”
on the team, Lord now has 87 men
on the roster.

Lord handles the runners and
jumpers, while assistant coach Lee
McLaughlin takes charge of the
weight men.

The team is fairly evenly spaced
through the different events, with
a heavy concentration in the javelin
and middle distance sections.

Captains for the season are
Skip Essex, a middle distance man
who has a 49.2 quarter mile to his
credit, Robin Kell, and John Pear-
son, a hurdler who has been side-
lined all winter with a broken ankle,
and who has just begun to hit his
stride again,

With all events except the javelin,
discus and 220 run on Wednesday,
prospects for the season are high.

“We have perhaps our toughest
meet right at the start of the sea-
son, and I hope that we'll be ready
for it,’ said Lord. The Thinclads
open at home against Old Dominion
College at 3:45 on March 27.

 

Defenseman Howie Young of
hockey’s Los Angels Blades had fans

The longest-running event of in-

How To Count—Intramural-Wise

The intramural scoring system is
a hodgepodge of incomprehensibility
to most people. A jumble of base
points, league points, play-off points
and raw score points, it makes little
sense to the average participant.

Each fraternity starts the year

with 100 base points, sort of a gift.
Penalties are
such as missing meetings (ten
points and turning in late entry
forms (five points).

After that,

50 participation points.
Then,
league,

get 15 points for finishing last.

Thus a fraternity can earn at least
60 points a sport just by showing

up, no matter how badly it does.

League points build up in ag-
gregates of five to reach 30 points
for a first place finish. Playoff points
work much the same way, running
from five points for fourth to 20

points for a championship finish.

to be in a four-team league, they

Thus, in a team sport, the school
champion receives 100 points, the
last place team may have as many
as 60, a difference of only 40 points
between first and twentieth.

In individual sports, such as
swimming or track, the winning
fraternity, raw  score-wise (by
NCAA scoring) receives 50 intra-
mural points. The number earned
diminishes down to eighteenth place,
which is worth 12 points.

Under this system, the difference
between fifth place and fifteenth
place is only ten points. Participa-
tion points are awarded much as
in team sports, with the highest
possible being 50.

That, in essence, is the intra-
mural system. A fraternity could,
just by getting full participation in
every sport, and never winning a
contest, earn 836 intramural points,
not an unrespectable total.

In wrestling, the last of the un-
finished business was cleaned up
this week when final tournament
standings were announced. KA took
first with a 3-0 record, followed by
Sigma Chi in second at 2-1, and DU
and Beta third at 0-2-1.

In bowling, Phi Kap and Kappa
Sig both remained undefeated in
tournament competition, easily de-
feating their opponents.

Kappa Sig picked up their victory
when Phi Psi forfeited their match.
Phi Kap won going away over
SAE 2503-2161.

The Phi Kap’s were led to their
victory by Jim Bussart’s sizzling
650 series, on games of 234, 179
and 237. Bill Tedards and Bob
Duckwall aided the cause with
series of 505 and 516 respectively.

Next week Phi Kap and Kappa
Sig will meet to determine the cham-

will play in the other contest, each
trying for its first tournament vic-

could go either way, but Kappa
Sig rates as the slight favorite.

In tournament action last night,
Phi Kap and ZBT were first round

DU, 3-2.

Tennis Features

By GUY UNANGST

Friday Sports Editor
All of last year’s regulars are
playing again this year for Wash-
ington and Lee’s varsity tennis team.
Practice began Monday with 17
varsity candidates trying for posi-
tions. The team will ultimately be

cut to ten men.

For the first time, the team’s
schedule will feature a spring trip,
which will be North Carolina and
other Virginia schools. The squad
will play 15 regular season matches,
seven more than last season.

Top Three Return
Number one man, captain Jim
DeYoung will lead the team which

includes numbers two and three men
of last year, Randy Jones and John

#| Baker. John Mills is the only mem-

ber of last year’s squad lost to

e graduation.

Howard Busse, Forrest Dickinson,
Jim Mell, Lindsey Short and Fred
Webb round out the list of return-
ing lettermen.

Last season the team posted a 5-3
record, losing only to Hampden-
Sidney, George Washington and Vir-
ginia, all of whom the team will
meet again this year.

Coach W. C. Washburn said it was
still much too early to make any pre-
dictions on the team’s chances, but
said it would probably be helped

Fifteen Frosh Try Out

The freshman tennis team looks
promising from the little bit that
has been seen thus far, according to
coach W. C. Washburn.

Last year’s freshman team com-
piled a 2-2 record defeating Vir-
ginia Episcopal and George Wash-
ington High. This season there are
fifteen candidates for the team,
which will be cut to ten men.

Washburn said, “In the freshman
squad there is some very fine prom-
ise from boys that showed up well
in the fall tournament.” Andy Kil-
patrick, a track team member, won
that event.

Among the freshman players are
Phil Thompson, Francis Grumbine,
Francis Jones and Doug Henckels.
The team opens their season April
ninth at home, against Virginia
Episcopal.

The full schedule: April 9, Vir-
ginia Episcopal; April 14, at Staun-
ton Military; April 22, Waynesboro
High; April 30, at Virginia fresh-
men.

Last week I mentioned only the
favorable aspects of the proposed
gym. Now it’s
time to look at
the other side of
the picture.

First—and most
important—where
would it be built?
The site of the
present gym
' would probably
= not be large
m enough unless

some of the park-

ing area were
used. The parking problem is bad
enough as it is, and the removal of
50 to 100 parking spaces would
create havoc.

 

O'Keefe

The next feasible site would be
the intramural field. Unfortunate-
ly this is probably too far away for
students to go back and forth be-
tween classes—unless they are
given ten minutes each way.

This would reduce the gym period
to 35 minutes. Such a span of time
could be long enough were it put
to its fullest possible use.

Athletic director E. P. “Cy”
Twombly has said he thinks the in-
tramural field would be too distant.
He suggested placing the gym at
the foot of the hill behind the
present gym. But then, out of sight,
it would not be a good show piece.

Twimbly said he favors leaving the
old gym standing. It could be used
exclusively for intramurals and
student overflow when the new
gym is filled with practice teams.

Also, the old gym would be a
perfect spot for holding dance sets.
“Those are bad enough on the floor
as it is,’ Twombly said. “The Mock
Convention will ruin it.”

Concerts could be held in the
new gym since bleachers will al-
ready be there, although if stu-
dents want to use chairs they
would have to continue to use the
present gym.

We have heard considerable doubt
expressed that the new gym would
be built within the next five to ‘ten
years as some have said it might
be.

In this matter, there is an impor-
tant fact to take into consideration.
Fred Cole is W&L’s president, and
quite a sports enthusiast.
