Brubeck Highlights Springs

Springs Weekend will be high-
lighted by two concerts. The first |
concert tonight features Dave Bru-
beck and his Quartet and the second
tomorrow night features the Chif-
fons, the Crystals and the Five
Royals.

The theme of these two concerts
in Doremus Gymnasium is “Night of
the Satyr.” In keeping with the
theme, the gymnasium atmosphere
will resemble a woodlands festival.
The object of the theme is to pre-
sent a celebration of the diety of
Pan and Bacchus.

Before the Brubeck concert, there
will be a cocktail party sponsored
by the Junior Class at 4:00. This
party behind the Sigma Nu house
will feature Dr. Feelgood and the
Interns. In case of rain the cocktail
party will be held at Moose Lodge.

Making his second appearance at
W&L, Brubeck and his Quartet will
play tonight froom 8 to 10 p.m. in
Doremus Gym

In addition to re;

‘ular albums of

 

standard jazz tunes, there are such
original albums as “Time Out” and
the latest, “Time Changes,” both of
which feature selections from the
usual jazz style. For his outstand-
ing accomplishments, Brubeck has
appeared on the cover of Time.

A typical Brubeck concert is rel-
atively sedate and sophisticated, of-
fering a wide variety of music within
Brubeck’s framework. He offers each
one of the musicians in his quartet
an opportunity to prove his adept-
ness.

The following evening at 8:00 the
Crystals, the Chiffons, and the Five
Royals will perform in Doremus
Gym.

With their recording of He’s So
Fine, the Chiffons burst upon the
national music scene in the winter
1963 with a tremendous explo-
which electrified the entire
record business. The Chiffons con-
tinued their success with their re-
of One Fine Day.

ol
sion

cording

 

They have a unique and instantly

identifiable sound and style. At pres-
ent they have recorded two long-
playing albums, both of which have
equalled the measure of success that
their single recordings did.

The Crystals hit the national rec-
ord scene with their single record-
ings of Do Doo Ron Ron, He’s Sure
the Boy I Love, and Then He Kissed
Me. The Crystals, following in the
style originated by the Shirelles,
have seen a great amount of success
in the popular music field.

The Five Royals appeared on
campus in 1962 when they play-
ed for the school cocktail party
in Red Square. The Royals have
recorded such hits as Think, Please,

Please, Please, and It’s Just What I
Want.
The official part of the Springs

weekend will end with the concert,
but of course the weekend will be
kept going with fraternity combos.

State Sentiment
To Be Polled

Chairmen of the Republican Party
in almost every county and city in
the United States have been asked
by Washington and Lee University’s
Mock Republican Convention lead-
ers which presidential candidates
they will vote for at their national
convention.

Over 3,400 questionnaires and let-
ters were mailed last week to the
Republican leaders in every State
except Texas and Arizona asking
for the number of votes the state’s
delegation will give to each candi-
date.

This nation-wide poll is an un-
precedented move by the Steering
Committee of the Mock Convention
to help the May 4-5 session main-
tain its high record of accurately
predicting who the national con-
vention will nominate.

Faced with the great uncertainty
in this year’s GOP presidential
nomination race, Philip D. Sharp,
Jr., chairman of the Steering Com-
mittee said they decided to go direct-
ly to whom they consider the Re-
publican Party’s opinion makers
with the nation-wide poll.

The poll asks two questions. The
first is: “In your opinion, for which
candidate will your state’s delega-
tion cast its vote on the first ballot?

The names of Goldwater, Lodge
Nixon, Rockefeller, Romney, Scran-
ton, Smith and favorite son are list-
ed after the question.

“If after
Gold-

Scranton—

The second question asks:
the first ballot, the totals are:
water—425; Nixon—200;
200; Rockfeller—150; Lodge—125;
to whom if to anyone, would your
delegates switch? (Again indicate
splits.)”

Again all the major candidates are
listed under this question with a
blank for any other name _ being
considered.

Texas and Arizona Republicans
not being polled because their
states are committed to Goldwater.

Republican leaders in Califor-
nia and Oregon received a different
questionnaire. In California 63
county chairmen and 130 delegates
and alternates to the 1960 Republi-
can National Convention were asked
one question: “Who do think will
win California’s primary on June
2—-Goldwater or Rockefeller?”

In Oregon, 35 county chairmen
and 33 delegates and alternates to
the 1960 Republican Convention
were asked the same question, but
with May 15. substituted the

Rockefeller, Scranton, Lodge

UP CANDIDATES WIN THREE TOP SPOTS
JIM KULP TO HEAD ‘Go STUDENT BODY

 

 

Morris Wins Largest Margin;
DeYoung, Kreitler Also Win

7 : . :
In yesterday’s student body elections, the University Party

swept the top three positions,

losing only the Fancy Dress

Presidency to the Progressive Patry.

Jim Kulp,

a second-year

law student, defeated Lamar

Lamb, the Progressive Party Candidate, by a clear margin of
279 votes (701-425) to win the position of President of the
*

Student Body.

Jim DeYoung defeated Steve
Smith for the position of Vice-Presi-
dent of the student body. The vote
was 659 for DeYoung and 465 for
Smith.

The largest margin of votes in
the election was shown in the race
for secretary of the student body.
Malcolm Morris soundly defeated
Brooks Brown by a margin of 473
votes (793-320).

The Progressive Party was vic-
torious in the race for President of
Fancy Dress. Dick Kreitler, a Phi
Psi, defeated Patton Adams, Pi
Phi, by a margin of sixteen votes
(571-555).

Voting Brisk

Voting yesterday was brisk. An
exceptionally large turnout high-
lighted the day. Both Parties were
successful in their efforts to get as
many people as possible to vote.

Al Eckes, President of the Univer-
sity Party, expressed his opinions
at the end of the election by say-
ing that he was extremely happy at
the results, and the strength of the
University Party candidates. He
stressed that he did not think that
this election saw the re-birth of
the big-party cliques. Eckes stated
that the University Party will pre-
sent the student body with an equal-
ly strong slate for the class elections
in May.

Jim Kulp

Jim Kulp, following his victory as
Student Body President, stated that

Postscript

Congratulations to the newly elected
sues and proposals which helped propel you to victory were
refreshingly realistic and sensible.

We might further note, however, and with no hard feelings,
that these last seven days were disappointingly uneventful
compared to previous student body elections. Perhaps this was
partly due to the decided majority of one of the parties. Yet
a significant factor was the apparent race both parties were
running to see who could be the more conservative. In the end,
as luck would have it, it was the party with the slogan “Sta-
bility” that grabbed the laurels. We don’t disparge this fact; we
just wonder how much this conservative sentiment prevails
on other campuses across the nation.

At any rate, we wish president-elect Jim Kulp and his

officers a most successful term,

hoping that the “Stability”? they stand for will be a somewhat

progressive one.

Letters To The Editor

 

Readers Speak Out On Religion Articles

Editor's Notice: Over the past
several weeks the Friday edition
of the Ring-tum Phi has printed a
series of attacks on Christianity
and the Church entitled “God is
dead.” To help offset the paganism
of the current weekend, however,
we shall interrupt our series to
present several of the sobering let-
ters from our readers. Next week,
we shall publish the concluding
installment which will discuss the
status of the church in the United
States and at the same time will
offer guidelines by which the
church can be led out of its di-
lemma.

Alumnus Disappointed By
Attempt To Debunk Faith

The Editor
Friday Edition
Ring-tum Phi

Dear Sir:

I am disappointed in your attempt
to debunk the Christian faith (ef.
March 20 edition). I am in my first
year in seminary and from what I
have learned so far could do a
much better job of showing where
the New Testament is suspect to
interpolations and bad _ translation.
But this is not a very good cri-
terion on which to judge the worth
of the faith. The big question is
as to whether the Gospel (there is
only one; it is reported in four dif-
ferent accounts) is relevant today.
And what is the Gospel but a state-
ment that God created this world
and that it is good and in the fullness
of time He sent His only Begotten
Son into the world that through
Him man might live. Sure you're
going to say that this is an old-
fashioned way of saying it. Well
perhaps it is but I have read some
of the new ways of saying it and

Lyric And State Praised For Programs;
Hud, Tom Jones, Victors To Appear

By BOB MOTTLEY

Dr, Strangelove was reviewed in
some detail in this corner a few
weeks ago; I will repeat only that
this is one of the finest “comedies”
to appear in many a day; the satire
is devastating and Peter Sellers’
performance as a patsy American
president is enough to make us wish
him a speedy recovery from a re-
cent stroke in California. Yet, be-
hind every guffaw lurks a sincere
Gf brief) prayer that nuclear war

may always seem this funny.

Film habituees in Lexington may
thank Messrs. Daves and Side for
a truly thrilling two months of out-
standing movies: Hud, 8%, and
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers
are expected at the Lyric; from the
State we have in succession after
Strangelove the excellent but con-
troversial Victors, Tom Jones, and
Captain Newman, M.D. And, in ret-
rospect. I hope all who so desired
were able to see Lawrence of Arabia
last week and Fellini’s La Strada,
courtesy of the Journalism Depart-
ment.

The 1964-65 movie season officially
begins (in the United States) after
the annual Oscar presentations. A
rundown on this year’s verdict, for
those who do not know: Best Pic.:
Tom Jones, Outst. Actor: Sidney
Poitier (in Lilies of the Field) Outst.
Actress: Patricia Neal (in Hud);
Best Supp. Actor: Melvyn Douglas
(in Hud); Best Supp. Actress: Mar-
garet Rutherford (in the VIPs).
From Shew, I offer the following
preview of films under preparation
for release in 1964:

The two biggest American produc-
tions are to have gala New York
premieres in October: My Fair
Lady (Audrey Hepburn, Rex Harri-
son, directed by George Cukor) and
The Greatest Story Ever Told (Max
Von Sydow, directed by George
Stevens). Other outstanding produc-
tions currently in preparation in-
clude The Sound of Music (Julie
Andrews) and The Sand Pebbles,
both directed by West Side Story’s
Robert Wise; John Huston’s Night
of the Iguana with Burton and Ava

Gardner; Sidney Lumet’s Fail-Safe
(Henry Fonda); Shirley Clarke’s
The Cool World; a very special pro-
duction of Joseph Conrad’s Lord
Jim by Richard Brooks, who directs
Peter O'Toole, James Mason, Eli
Wallach, and Jack Hawkins in the
great sea epic. Billy Wilder, who
produced Irma La Douce, is plan-
ning the Private Life ef Sherlock
Holmes with O’Toole as Holmes and
Peter Sellers as Watson.

On a lower level, the freshest of
the inevitable breed of Rock Hud-

son-Doris Day comedies is soon to;
be released: Send Me No Flowers. |
And, to add the final touch to the)
American scene, Jerry Lewis’ latest
will appear shortly: The Patsy.

Foreign Films

In the U.S.S.\R., Sergei Bondar-
chuk is engrossed in War and Peace,
a mammoth effort soon to result
in four feature-length films. In
Sweden, Ingmar Bergman has finish-
ed a comedy in color, All These Wo-
men, to be issued here in Septem-
ber. In Italy, Fredrico Fellini is
preparing another film starring his
wife Giulietta Masina, this one
called Giulietta of the Spirits—an
original story about magic. Anton-
ioni has completed an unusual tale
of marriage trauma, Red Dessert,
with Monica Vitti and Richard Har-
ris. Lucino Visconti is currently
directing Marcello Mastroianni in a
drama based on The Stranger by

Albert Camus. In France, Serge
Bourguignon, who directed Sun-

days and Cybelle, is working on

 

Not To Give Up Our Dreams, the

story of a jazz musician’s develop-
ment.

In England, Lindsay Anderson
(who directed This Sporting Life) is
filming Richard Harris in Heath-
cliff. The Boulting brothers, who
may be forgiven for Heavens Abovel,
are putting the final licks to some-
thing innocently called Who’s for
Sex? David Lean, director of the
masterful Lawrence of Arabia, is
now preparing Dr. Zhivago from the
novel by Pasternak. Carol Reed is
reworking Irving Stone’s The Agony
and the Ecstacy with Charlton
Heston and Rex Harrison. And last
but not least, the director of Tom
Jones, Anthony Richardson, has two
more possible winners in the fire:
The Charge of the Light Brigade,
and an adaptation of Evelyn Waugh’s
novel about California funeral prac-
tices, The Loved One.

Other films will, of course, be
produced in 1964; however, these
are the ones that are anticipated
with the most relish by the critics.
It looks like it is going to be a
bullish year!

 

Spring Elections, Party Beer Rallies
Prove That Good Times Are Here

By DREW BAUR

The spring elections, with kegs
four nights a week, bring to mind
that good times
are here again. It
seems like a long
time since Fancy
Dress, but Springs
is well worth the
wait.

Except for the
UVa. football
team, the entire
Friday of 63
Springs remains a
rather large blank

   

arm
nt

Baur ; .
in my mind, but
the following day was one which
is worth reviewing.
Since it was a warm, sunny day

most of the campus packed up their

hangovers, dates, aspirin, and Bloody

Mary mix and headed for either
Goshen or Twin Falls as quickly
as possible. Just after noon, most

remembered that there was a combo
in Red Square about two o'clock.

Leaping into their cars, the slyphs

 

 

and nymphs played Stirling Moss
between river and school. By get-
ting back a half hour early, they
had time to resupply themselves
and prepare for the concert that
night. After junking it up all after-
noon either behind the Beta house

or at apartments, everyone put on
a tie and socks to carry the party
to the gymnasium.

The concert could have been
somewhat of a nightmare, however,
it was saved by the mattresses. Be-

cause Springs and SIPA weekend
did not coincide, the mattresses in
the gym were not being used, so
people sitting on the track were
able to get some rack during the
concert. The IBM-like Bo Diddley
and the Andy Capp-like Isley
Brothers put on a good show for

the crowd. From the gym the scene
shifted back to the fraternity houses.
This phase of the evening could be
called the second in a series of wars
between the UVa. footballers and
the Phi Gams. Finally as night fell
on the Stevesville Motel. ...

Only one thought for this year’s

deman and the Ineps soon

they just restate it. You can read
Origen, Barth, Tillich, or Bishop
Robinson and all you read is a new
way to say the same ‘thing. And
remember that religion is not some-
thing that we can approach the way
we might some philosophical system.
Religion deals with the very basis
of being. And because of this fact
we can only judge it as we live it.
Or in more popular terms “don’t
knock it till you try it.” And to try
it one must enter it whole heartedly.
And if one does this the question of
relevance of religion ceases to be a
question. And the reason is that the
question itself will become irrele-
vant, and when the question be-
comes irrelevant then it takes a lot
more than Mencken’s article to shake
one’s faith.

Babcock Challenges Lane’s
Justification By Desire’

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

This campus would smell on ice.
The aroma—the attitude of this
student body—is a disgrace to the
traditions of George Washington and
Robert E. Lee. The pseudo-intellec-
tualism here is almost nauseating:
for example, the current sexual rev-
olution is considered beneficient by
most of the persons here. However,
it is interesting to note that those
persons, the “intellectuals,” have
not seen the inside of a church for
years, and yet consider themselves
authorities on morality. It seems
that the Church at Washington and
Lee is becoming farther and farther
removed as an outdated intellectual
cult while the new basis for moral
behavior is the mere rationality of
human desires.

 

I found it highly significant to find
a total of four people at a recent
showing of One Man’s Way, the
story of Norman Vincent Peale. Dr.
Peale is a man who lives and tteach-
es the dynamic doctrine of the
Judeo-Christian theology—that God
is Love, and that with God, all
things are possible. What a contrast
is Dr. Peale’s book, The Power of
Positive Thinking, to Ken Lane’s
article in last week’s Ring-tum Phi
entitled “God Is Dead.” Mr. Lane
justified his article as a means for
the triumph of truth. Is that what it
was, or was it the “Gospel truth,” as
far as this campus is concerned?
WILLIAM R. BABCOCK

Kirkley Reviews Challenge
Faced By Christian Church
To the Editor:

Sir:
I enjoyed your article “God Is
Dead—Part II.” That support of

the Christian Church is declining,
particularly on our college campus-
es, is a fact few would dispute.
The irony of the Easter celebra-
tions—that so many gather together
in so many places for services that
mean so little to so few—was ap-
parent to most of us several Sun-
days ago. For instance, in the Cathe-
dral of St. Philip in Atlanta the
trite, worn-out phraseology of the
Easter message was accompanied by
loud, blatant organ music which
successfully drowned out the pitiful-
ly weak voices of 1600 Episcopalians.
Perhaps the reason why so many
individuals today have ceased to
support the church as a social in-
stitution is this: the church, in
seeking to maintain itself as an
organization, has ceased to grow
and develop from within; in di-
recting its attention to forms, it

 

has forgotten meaning; through

seeking its own ends, it has stop-
ped meeting the individual needs
of the persons, its members.

Because of the crisis faced both
by individuals and by the Church in
today’s mass society, however, I
would disagree with your statement
that, as a vocation open to college
graduates, “the church offers no
challenge comparable to that of
IBM and Wall Street.” Of course,
the life of a minister, just like the
life of a college professor or a busi-

_|Mmess man, can be an escape from

the existential problem of being hu-
man in society with other men.

But precisely because the stresses
of modern life place such a burden
upon individuals and upon the
Church, which must maintain its in-
tegrity as a functioning organiza-
tion without sacrificing its direct ap-
peal to and concern for each per-
son, the challenge and opportunity
of the ministry as a form through
which one can create meaning in
life is exceptionally great.

Further, though I cannot make a
statement regarding seminaries in
general, I have recently spent about
a week at Virginia Theological Sem-
inary in Alexandria and feel that
this small group of persons, both as
scholars and as men, are attempting
to make the gospel relevant to life
today. I talked with ‘bishops, minis-
ters, professors, and students who
live and work with the businessmen,
the politicians, the laborers, and the
poor in and around the nation’s
capital. These men are aware of
today’s problems in all walks of
life and are acting with intelligence
and purpose to meet these problems
effectively.

The challenge is apparent. There
should be a greater response.

Sincerely,
JOHN KIRKLEY

Pete Heumann, sophomore righthander, pitched the Gen-
erals to the 9-7 victory. He had relieved starter Chris Wigert

in the fourth inning.

The win gave W&L a 1-4-1 record against collegiate com-
*

pecition, 2-7-1 oveeall.

The Generals weored their nine
runs on nine hits and_ three
Lynchburg errors. W&L made four
errors, while the Hornets got 11
hits.

Green Catches

Kenny Green tovk over as catcher
for the Generals, Tom Crenshaw
switching to left field. Green got
two hits and, according to coach Joe
Lyles, “caught a fine game.”

Lyles attributed the victory to the
fact that the team had finally gotten
the big hitting.

The Generals met Richmond Pro-
fessional Institute in Richmond this
afternoon. RPI, under coach Ed
Allen, had only lost one game this
year. W&l won two games from
RPI last season.

W&L had, until beating Lynch-
burg, lacked hitting. The team had
averaged only three runs a game
in collegiate competition. The Gen-
erals had twice been shut out and
three times held to one run.

Fort Bragg Next
Two of these one-run games were
against Fort Bragg, who meets the
Generals here Tuesday. Fort Bragg

defeated W&L 7-6, 14-1 and 9-1 on},

the spring trip.

Several of the Fort Bragg ball-
players are former major leaguers.
Left fielder Bill Baker played with
Cincinnati, shortstop Dick Schmidt
with Los Angeles.

W&L has four more regularly
scheduled games and a_ postponed
game with RPI before the
tournament beginning May 8
Danville, Ky.

A tough ZBT volleyball team
swept through the playoffs in that
sport to take the championship and
move into third place in the I-M
standings for all sports.

ZBT took the title after whip-
ping Phi Kappa Sig, Delt, and
DU. DU, losing only to ZBT, came
on strong to repeat in the runner-
up spot. Delt managed to chip five
points away from the Phi Kappa
Sig all I-M lead by downing the
Phi Kap’s in the volleyball play-
offs and taking third place. Phi
Kap finished fourth.

With the inclusion of the volley-
ball standings, Phi Kappa Sig still
leads the I-M standings with 1528
points. Defending champ Delt fol-
lows in second place with 1365. ZBT,
previously tied for third, has moved
ahead of SAE with 1313 points.

The I-M softball season opened
this week, with defending champion
Delt rating as the team to beat.
The Delts opened the season by giv-
ing Phi Psi a 12-2 pasting.

On the whole, it was a pretty
poor week for pitchers, with 120
runs scored in the five games play-
ed.

SPE scored 20 of the runs when
they whipped Beta, 20-12, but
Sigma Nu took the week's record
when they piled up 23 runs in
defeating Lambda Chi 23-13. In a
game that went eight innings in-
stead of the regulation softball
seven, DU whipped Pi Phi, 17-14
in spite of Howard Busse’s five
for five performance.

In the league’s only pitcher’s duel,
Law displayed its customary good
pitching in edging Phi Gam 4-3. In
other games PiKA won by forfeit
over NFU, and PEP won by for-
feit over KA,

Soccer Meet Draws 32

Thirty-two men, including 12 let-
termen, turned out for a _ soccer
meeting Tuesday night.

The soccer team begins spring
practice May 11. Coach Joe Lyles
said he hopes to stage an alumni-
varsity game May 16.

Last season the soccer team com-
piled a 6-3 record. Only four letter-
men have been lost from that team.
The freshmen won five of eight
games.

Freshmen Beat AMA 7-2;
Varsity Preps for Villanova

While the varsity lacrosse team was running through its
last full scale practice yesterday in preparation for tomorrow’s
game against Villanova, the W&L freshmen defeated Augusta
Military 7-2.

The freshmen, led by crease attackman Scott Tappan’s
four goals, were in control of the game from the opening face-
off. Fred Skinner took the ball on the face-off and fed to Tap-

pan for the score in the first five seconds of the game.

Tennis Team Meets Lynchburg

For the second time the tennis
team’s match with Hampden-Sydney
has been rained out. This time the
match was scheduled for Tuesday.

This afternoon the team met
Lynchburg here, minus, just as it
was for most of the spring trip, its
top two men. Jim DeYoung is out

 

Duckwall’s 79 Sets Pace
As Golfers Beat Lynchburg

The Washington and Lee Golf team
defeated Hampden-Sydney 6'2-2'2
yesterday afternoon. The victory up-
ped the Generals record to 2-0.

Bob Duckwall took medalist hon-

ors, shooting a 79 over Lynch-
burg’s Boonsboro Country Club
course.

W&L was to have met Roanoke
College Tuesday, but rain postponed
the match. It has been rescheduled
for Wednesday.

Last year the Generals won four
matches and tied one. Coach E. P.
“Cy” Twombly said he hopes this
year’s team can better that mark.

This afternoon the golfers met
Virginia in Hot Springs. Virginia,
defender of the state intercollegiate
title, defeated W&L 17-10 last year,
on a nine points per foursome
basis.

Ralph Callahan and John Verity
led the strong Cavalier team, which
beat VMI and VPI in a triangular
match last week.

The Generals meet Old Dominion
in Norfolk Monday.

The Generals completely domi-
nated play in the first half, scoring
all their goals before the halftime
break. Even crease defenseman Dave
Shufflebarger got into the act, and
picked up an assist with a feed to
Tappan.

Both Augusta goals came iate in
the fourth quarter after W&L goalie
Skip Brooks had left the field.

Villanova Tomorrow

Tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. on Wilson
Field W&L will meet a Villanova
team plagued by injuries thus far
this season.

Villanova has lost its last two
games, to Georgetown 10-9, and to
New York Maritime, 8-4. Also hav-
ing lost to C. W. Post and Ohio
State, Villanova has a 0-4 season
record.

This year’s Villanova team is vir-
tually the same team that compiled
a 6-5 record last year. Coach Bob
McHenry said that if the Pennsyl-
vanians report in good physical con-
dition, the Generals could have a
tough game on their hands.

Plays Zone

Villanova, like Swarthmore and
North Carolina, whom the Generals
play next, will run a zone defense.
W&L has not been impressive
against the zone this year, but Mc-
Henry feels the Swarthmore exper-
ience will stand the team in good

with a side injury; John Baker was
singing at a wedding.

Earlier, Lynchburg had _ been
beaten by Randolph-Macon, a team
that the Generals defeated 6-3.

The freshman team was also rained
out Tuesday. Their match, against
Staunton Military, has been re-
scheduled to April 29.

Randy Jones played number one
this afternoon for W&L. Jones won
five of six matches in that position

on the spring trip. stead.
Jim Mell (6-2) and Forest Dick-| Villanova has excellent stick~

Gasque, Kell
Lead W&L
To Win

Freshman Gay Gasque broke the
school record in the shot put for
the second time in three weeks,
winning the discus also, and Rob-
in Kell captured the triple jump
and the high jump to lead the Gen-
eral track team to an 87-58 victory
over Bridgewater College Tuesday
on the W&L track.

Gasque’s heave of 47’ 6” broke
his own school record of 46’ 4”
which he had set against Old Do-
minion. Saturday he had set a new
freshman record in the Colonial
Relay meet in Williamsburg with a
throw of 45’ 11”. He also won the
discus Tuesday with a 126 7” ef-
fort.

Kell continued his unbeaten record
in the triple jump as he leaped
41’ 8%” to win the event. He also
won the high jump at 5’ 8”.

The win pushes the thin clads’
dual meet record to 2-1. Bridgewater
is now 1-1.

W&L Sweeps Three

The Generals combined individual
effort with team depth to defeat
the visitors. W&l won 10 of the
17 events, sweeping three.

Two of the sweeps were in field
events, all of which, with the ex-
ception of the broad jump, were
captured by W&L. George Vogel
led the way in the javelin, winning
it with a 152’ 3” toss. Johnny Gra-
ham led the sweep in the pole vault
with a winning height of 11’ 6”.

Chris Kell headed the General
sweep of the 100-yard dash, clock-
ing 10.6.

Essex Wins Easily

Co-captain Skip Essex had an
easy go of it, winning the quarter
mile in 52.7, and Jim Thompson
took the 880 in 2:03.1. The Generals
won the 440 relay with a 445
clocking, but lost the mile relay
even though an unofficial team de-
feated the Bridgewater squad.

This afternoon, the harriers travel
to Roanoke College. This promises
to be one of the season’s tougher
meets. Coach Norm Lord pointed
out that W&L has not defeated Roa-
noke since he has been coaching
here.

 

Happy
Birthday

Mr. K

 

 

The score was 3-2, in the ninth.

And that’s the way it stayed as
the New York Yankees were beaten
by their own farm team, the Rich-
mond Virginians.

How did the Yankees look against
the Vees last weekend? Miserable.
The Vees, who finished near the
bottom last year in the International
League, not only beat the Yankees
32, but also played a better brand
of ball.

To watch them play, you’d never
know that the Yankees are the
odds-on favorites to win another
pennant. Only one word can de-
scribe their performance—sick.
The Virginians, about as short on

power as a rundown battery, used
their speed to score the surprising
victory in the Richmond exhibition
game.

They poured on the steam to score
off two weak hits in the sixth
inning off Ralph Terry. Then, in
the eighth, pinch-hitter Ike Futch
knocked a single to center field,
stole second base and scored the
winning run on a hard ground single
to right by Horace Clark.

The extra speed almost got the
Vees another run when Clarke came
all the way from first on a fly ball
double by Art Lopez, but a perfect
relay just barely got Clarke at
home.

"After scoring on the Vees twice
in six innings, the Yankees took
out Mantle and Maris. It would
appear the Yankees thought they
had the game in the bag.

Yankee pitcher Ralph Terry put
on a memorable performance by
falling on his tail when he tried to
catch a pop-up.

The Yankees admitted after the
game that the Vee’s superior speed
had made the difference. Even
rookie manager Yogi Berra was im-
pressed—‘“It looks like we sent our
speed team to Richmond. I like that
speed. There’s no substitute for it.”

Mantle, who watched the last
three innings in the stands among
autograph hunters, admitted that
one of his greatest assets, his speed,
is gone.

“I know I can’t run with a lot
of them anymore,” said Mantle, who
is nearing 33 and underwent knee
surgery during the winter.

“‘Tve been thrown out on three
balls by the shortstop this year.
I'd hit to deep short and they'd
get me. Hell, they used to keep
the ball when I hit there. They
didn’t even look toward first.

“When I first came up I never
saw anyone who could outrun me.
Now, most of them can.”
