Humphrey
Gives Talk

By REN MANNING

Novelist William Humphrey,
Glasgow visiting professor here
this semester for the fall term,
1963-64, gave the first of a
series of lectures he will de-

liver periodically last night in
Lee Chapel at 8 p.m. In his lecture
he differentiated between the so-
called city-slicker novelist and the
country “hick,” after which he ful-
ly expounded on the importance of
and the manner in which the latter
form of literature developed.

Mr. Humphrey is one of the more
widely acclaimed writers of his gen-
eration, having written such best-
sellers as The Last Husband, a col-
lection of short stories, and Home
From the Hill, which won for him
broad critical acclaim and which was
a success both in its original edition
and later in paperback. He has had
two recent short stories appear in
Esquire and in this September issue
of The Atlantic Monthly.

Imaginative Form of Literature

In his well-attended lecture last
night Mr. Humphrey reiterated again
the statement that the novel is, has
and always will be the only comple-
tely imaginative form of literature.
Especially writers like Hardy, Scott,
Faulkner, and Emily Bronte, whom
Mr. Humphrey classified as “hick”
writers, typify the common, non-
urban middle or lower class, to
which the majority belong. Since the
type of literature these writers create
is of the rural nature, the only
proper way to represent the novel is
through a low style, which would
accordingly, be the style of the per-
sonages. Gradually, this form of lit-
erature grew in popularity and the
possibilities for expression. In con-
clusion, Mr. Humphrey declared
that the common people are another
race entirely, just as the American
Indian for example. This situation
is the same in all countries. They
have their own culture and litera-
ture, both oral and written. It was
the novel which had the primary
step in showing this distinction.

Mr. Humphrey’s stay here for the
fall semester is sponsored by the
Glasgow Endowment Program,

JFK Suggested

For Nomination

Several weeks ago the Mock
Convention Steering Committee
mailed letters to all members of
Congress informing them of the
Convention, The letters were bi-
partisan in content, but Demo-
cratic congresswoman Edith Green
was somewhat surprised to hear
from the Republican student Con-
vention, The resulting story was
printed in last Sunday’s edition of
the Washington Post.

Rep. Edith Green (D-Ore.) re-
ceived a surprise call the other day
for help in promoting Washington
and Lee University’s 1964 Mock Re-
publican National Convention. Since
1908, the university’s famed student
convention have usually called the
turn for the party out of power.
Student Chairman Philip D. Sharp,
Jr., wanted next year to be no ex-
ception.

Mrs. Green, a militant Democrat,
gave the matter some thought. Her
administrative assistant, A. Wesley
Barthelmes, Jr., then sent the fol-
lowing reply:

“Mrs. Green was both startled
and pleased to receive your letter
inviting her to do ‘whatever you
can to assist us’ in assuring the suc-
cess of the 1964 Washington and
Lee Republican Mock Convention.
She also notes with interest your
record of having correctly predict-
ed the outcome of the last presi-
dential elections.

“Being a Democrat of long stand-
ing and wanting to assist you in
continuing your string of successful
predictions, Mrs. Greene suggests
you nominate John F. Kennedy.
Aside from his great abilities and
charm, he is well known by the
public, having occupied the White
House since January, 1961. The best
technique would be to elect by ac-
elamation on the first ballot. Of
course, we Democrats would insist
on first claim upon him as ‘our’
President.”

 

Law Bows

Are law and morality inde-
pendent of each other?

This is the question which
Dr. Samuel E. Stumpf, chair-
man of the Vanderbilt depart-

ment of philosophy, presented
this week in a series of lectures en-
titled, “The Moral Order and the
Legal Order.”

Dr. Stumpf spoke here last Tues-
day and Wednesday under the aus-
pices of the University Christian
Association, the department of re-
ligion and the Student Bar Associa-
tion.

“Law, as I understand it,” Stumpf
said, “is not an independent phe-
nomenon. It is a moral phenom-
enon; thus, it is impossible to con-
ceive of law divorced of moral pro-
cesses. By the time there is a sys-
tem of law, it is freighted with mor-
als.”

Stumpf quoted President Ken-
nedy from a recent speech at
Vanderbilt: “The rule of law is the
essence in our democracy but cer-
tain things in our tradition de-
mand that we take a stand on hu-
man rights. This may bring our
principles into conflict.” Stumpf
felt that our higher duty is to the
moral order, which is not neces-
sarily in conflict with the legal
order,

In order to show how the moral
order impinges on the legal order,
Stumpf divided his Tuesday night
lecture into 1.) the origin of law and
2.) the ends of law.

The philosophy professor remark-
ed that the source of law lay in the
“pathology of legal theory.” In
illustrating the Marxist viewpoint,
he stated that the Marxist may not
have separated the moral and legal
order. To the Marxist historical per-
spective, there evolves a different set
of ideas about law, morals, and re-
ligion as the “dialectic” swings from
the primitive communal society, to
the slave society, the feudal, the
capitalist, and finally in the future
to the true communist state. The
important distinction about Marx,
Stumpf stated, is his claim that all
moral and legal orders stem from
material factors, such factors, for
example ,as production.

Stumpf explained that the theory
of natural law, in direct opposition
to the Marxist theory, has been
another explanation for the origin
of law and morality. Proponents of
this theory maintained that what
governs man’s sense of right is an
innate or pre-existent law.

The interrelationship between law
and morality, Stumpf added, begins
when people start conceiving of
universal laws of behavior.

Stumpf projected what he con-
siders three such universals: 1.) that
promises should be kept; 2) that no
one should deliberately harm an-
other; 3.) that every man _ should
respect what is another’s.

In his Wednesday night lecture,
Stumpf made four comparisons be-
tween the moral and the legal order
to demonstrate that law is a moral
phenomenon. He said that what
we think of religion and morality as

lecture in duPont Auditorium. (Photo by Caro.)

To Morals

Religion Speaker Says

our duty is often bound up with
our legal duty.

First, he defferentiated the two by
stating that the legal order is con-
cerned with man’s external conduct |
as opposed to the moral order which
is concerned with a man’s internal
motives.

Second, the law is concerned with
a minimum moral standard while
morality is concerned with the
righteous man, as a whole. The
scope of law changes from one era
to the next and has recently broad-
ened its scope considerably, he said.
The law has moved in response to
the urge of morals into the field of
morality.

Third, the law is made; moral
principles are discovered. A moral |
rule is found, a law can be made
and repealed; thus, the quality
of morality is categorical and be-
yond repeal. Official recognition
changes a moral rule to a legal one.

As his fourth, differentiation,
Stumpf stated that law and morali-
ty have different degrees of obliga-
tion. The law is not the stand of
our morality. Courts and legal sys-
tems only continue when they have
moral relevance to the times. Thus,
law is a moral phenomenon, obedi-
to the law being a moral act.

Pianist Hummel
To Perform Here

Pianist Stanley Hummel will be
presented in a recital Monday at
8 p.m. in Washington and Lee Uni-
versity ’s Lee Chapel.

The Albany, N. Y., musician,
whose New York debut was made
at the age of 17, has been well
known to concert audiences since
his early childhood. His musical
training included a season’s work at
the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Aus-
tria, and a fellowship which was ex-
tended to six years at the Julliard
Graduate School, where he studied
with Josef Lhevinne.

New York critics have called
Hummel “the kind of pianist who
keeps general concert standards
high,” and “a master of technical
matters” and have described his
playing as “a display of virtuosity
such as is rarely heard.”

Monday's program will include
“Sonata, Op. 53” by Beethoven,
Schumann’s “Carnaval,” Chopin’s
“Etudes, Op. 10, Nos. 3 and 4,” “Re-
flects Dans L’Eeu” and “Fleux
D’Artifice’ by Debussy, William
Schumann's “Three-Score Set” and
“Vision Fugitive” and “Toceata” by
Prokofieff.

The recital, sponsored by Washig-
ton and Lee’s Concert Guild, will be
open to the public. The program is
the second on the University Con-
cert Guild’s 1963-64 schedule.

Ellison To Lecture Tonight
On ‘Novel And Experience’

 

Local SDX
Hosts Meetin g

The Washington and Lee chapter
of Sigma Delta Chi served as under-
graduate host chapter for the annual
convention of the national profes-
sional journalistic society held last
week in Norfolk.

More than 500 persons from pro-
fessional and undergraduate chap-
ters across the nation attended the
54th anniversary convention.

As hosts, the local group helped
the national president of the organ-
ization in a number of ways.

Members of the group also par-
ticipated in the news writing con-
test held for undergraduates.

Charles Flippen, president of the
W&L chapter, won third place in the
contest. Approximately 75 of the na-
tion’s top undergraduate journalism
students competed.

The students had to cover a talk
and press conference given by Dr.
Glenn Seaborg, chairman of the At-
tomiec Energy Commission. Dr. Sea-
borg spoke on the peaceful use of
nuclear power and also announced
that a group of Russian scientists
would tour this country’s non-mil-
itary atomic installations later this
month,

Also speaking to the delegates
were Admiral H. Page Smith, USN,
Supreme Allied Commander At-
lantic; Turner Catledge, managing
editor of The New York Times, and
Mills Godwin, Lt. Gov. of Virgiina.

Walter Cronkite of CBS news, in
a dinner address spoke on the limi-
tations of both press and broadcast
media in reporting the news and
called for closer cooperation between
the two.

Tour of Williamsburg

Among the activities of the four-
day convention were a tour of Wil-
liam and Mary College and Colonial
Williamsburg, a ferry boat tour of
the Chesapeake Bay and inspection
of the Navy atomic aircraft carrier,
the Enterprise.

The convention was held Wednes-
day through Saturday of last week.

John Watts, vice-president of the
W&L chapter, was the chapter’s offi-
cial voting delegate.

The W&L chapter of SDX was
formed in 1929.

In the near future, Flippen, the
current president of the W&L chap-
ter, hopes to be able to sponsor
speakers for public lectures.

Debate Team
Goes To WG M

Washington and Lee is entering
four teams in a _ regional debate
tournament being held this weekend
at William and Mary.

Eight students are at Williams-
burg for the Region 3 Tau Kappa
Alpha-Delta Sigma Rho Tourna-
ment. Tau Kappa Alpha and Delta
Sigma Rho are two of the nation’s

 

largest debating fraternities, and
W&L has a TKA chapter.
The region includes Virginia,

Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky,
and the District of Columbia. Other,
strong teams at the meet will be
George Washington, American, Ken-
tucky, UVa., William and Mary,
Richmond, Maryland and West Vir-
ginia,

The four W&L teams are Jay
Clark and Jack Eure, affirmative;
Steve Smith and Tod Crowell, af-
firmative; Chuck Levy and Bill
Torrey, negative; Tabor Novak and
Roy Powell, negative. All the teams
except the first, Clark and Eure, are
debating together in a tournament
for the first time.

Debate Coach William Chaffin is
again keeping the strength of the
Washington and Lee debate team out
of the meet by holding Mike Hayslip
and Ed Fitzgerald home. Last
year at the same tournament, Chaf-
fin did not enter the same team
which won the championship two
years in a row.

Next Monday members of the
team will stage an exhibition de-
bate at Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College at Lynchburg.

UCA Introduces

Tutor Services
For Freshmen

This year the University Chris-
tian Association, under the guid-
ance of Dr. Louis Hodges, has com-
piled a list of tutors available to
W&L students.

Each year, Dr. Hodges, explains,
many students who are obviously
able to do well in their courses fail
for reasons other than lack of abil-
ity. The UCA in an attempt to curb
these failures has made up the list
of tutors who are willing to help
students with academic problems at
no cost.

From the faculty, the Association
acquired a list of students who, in
the opinion of the appropriate pro-
fessors, were able to give help in a
specific subject.

From this list the UCA selected a
number of students who were then
contacted and asked if they cared
to volunteer their services. The
names of the students who replied
affirmatively were then placed on a
list which was mimeographed and
given to freshmen, faculty advisors,
fraternity president, and the deans of
the various schools.

Dr .Hodges has pointed out that
the tutors are not only useful to
the failing students, but also to the
student who, although his grades are
not extremely low, feels that they
are definitely below what they
should be, and is willing to work
for the grades he desires.

 

Gamber, Lathrop, Named
To Athletic Committee

The Executive Committee an-
nounced Wednesday the appoint-
ment of Brice Gamber and Robert
Lathrop as student representatives
to the University Committee on
Athletics.

Brice Gamber, a senior from Bal-
timore, Maryland, is President of
the Delta Tau Delta house and a
member of the varsity football
squad. He is also captain of the
baseball team, president of the Var-
sity Club, and vice-president of the
senior class of the Commerce School.

Bob Lathrop, also a Delt, hails
from Haverford, Pennsylvania, and
is freshman soccer coach and assist-
ant varsity coach. As an undergrad-
uate, Lathrop was all-state and all-
conference in soccer. He is now at-
tending law school here.

 

Placement Notice
Wednesday, November 20

Mr. J. Edward Robertson of the
Washington office of Haskins & Sells
will be on our campus to talk to
students interested
counting careers.

in public ac-

*ment of English.

Born in Oklahoma City on March
1, 1914, Mr. Ellison attended Tusk-
gee Institute from 1933 to 1936 where
he was a music major. After a sum-
mer in New York studying sculp-
ture he abandoned his music studies
for writing and participation in the
New York City Writer’s Project.

Rosenwald Fellowship

In 1945, he received a Rosenwald
Fellowship which permitted him to
begin work on his celebrated novel,
Invisible Man, which won the Na-
tional Book Award of 1952.

In 1955, Ellison was awarded the
Prix de Rome Fellowship by the
American Academy of Arts and Let-
ters. Previously, he had lectured at
the Salzburg, Austria, Seminar in
American Studies. From 1957 to 1961
he was Visiting Lecturer in Litera-
ture at Bard College and two years
ago served as the Alexander White
Visiting Professor at the Univer-
sity of Chicago.

Jazz Board Member

Mr. Ellison is currently a Board
Member of the Institute of Jazz
Studies. Since his childhcod, he has
worked as a newsboy, dental assist-
ant, receptionist, jazz trumpeter,
world lecturer on literature and
professional photographer. His prin-
cipal hobby is experimental audio-
electronics.

In an interview by the Paris Re-
view, Ellison was questioned as to
his ideas involving social protest,
Negro provincialism and “universal-
ity in literature” with its debt to
Negro folklore.

When asked to what degree the
highly regarded theory of social
realism influenced his writing, El-
lison singled out Malraux as one
of his influences. He considers him
more of a human artist than most
Marxian writers and he considers
Malraux to be the artist-revolution-
ary rather than the policitican after
writing Man’s Fate.

Art, Not Injustice

He realizes that Malraux’s concern
for the tragic struggle of humanity
is unlike that of the other social
realists who were concerned less
with tragedy than with injustice.
Ellison goes so far as to say that he,
himself, is concerned not with in-
justice but with art.

Later in the interview, when asked
of the tendency of critics to group
novels written by Negroes as so-
called “protest novels,” Ellison
complained that these critics should
eoncern themselves more with the
lack of craftsmanship and the pro-
vineialism which is apparent in
Negro writing.

To Ellison, the much sought-after
“universal theme” in the novel is
reached only by the depiction of the
specific man in a specific circum-
stance. Ellison blames both the Negro
writer and the white reader for
critics’ attitudes toward provincial-
ism; the Negro for “drawing his
blackness too tightly around him
and the white for drawing his white-
ness around himself when he sits
down to read.”

Two Points Of View

How much control should a university have over the
standards of our personal conduct? Last week at Harvard, this
issue was brought rather prominently to the surface by a noted
educator, John Kenneth Galbraith.

A former Ambassador to India, Galbraith stated in a letter
to The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, that the
function of a university is not to act as a moral watchdog, but
“to provide the best teaching that can be associated with the
scientific, literary, artistic or other scholarly preoccupations of

the faculty.”

Galbraith, if we may so interpret, maintains that a university
exists for the development of the intellect, not the morality,
of its students. His apparent argument is that by restricting
a student’s freedom, the university is not being realistic. A stu-
dent, if he is to be prepared for life, must be exposed to the
freedom he will experience after he graduates from college;
above all, he must be exposed to the temptations implicit in
this freedom if he is to achieve any sort of immunity from them
when he is on his own. Such is the Galbraithian stand.

With regard to this issue of personal freedom, many stu-
dents feel that W&L presents a definite contradiction. In the
orientation speeches at the beginning of school, freshmen are
addressed as ‘“‘gentlemen.”” They are told that W&L has one
and only one rule—“be a gentleman.’ Yet, to the contrary,
what we face in actuality is quite an elaborate list of rules
and regulations: off-limits rules for girls, prohibition against
drinking on University property, compulsory class attendance,

conventional dress, etc.

Galbraith would criticize this policy. He has explained such
restrictions as the result of “the frustrated maternalism which
lurks . . . in any academic administration.”

Below, in direct contrast to Galbraith, we present a very

cogent and concise argument

analyzing and endorsing the

university’s concern over its student’s moral probity. Here
President John A. Logan of Hollins College takes a realistic
and sober approach to this question of freedom versus restric-
tion. “True freedom,” he states, “‘comes through commit-
ment... it cannot be found in aimless hedonism or irrespon-

sible drift.”

For a broadened insight of this stand, we urge you to ana-

lyze the article below.

 

Faculty Members Evaluate W&L Fraternities

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

It is felt by many students here
that generally speaking, the W&L
faculty is hostile to our fraternities
and is trying by overt or more
subtle means to limit or abolish
them altogether. However, in trying
to get a representative sampling of
professors’ opinions on fraternities,
it was impossible to find even one
who is really “anti-fraternity,”
though all had some criticisms to
make.

Three of our faculty members were
interviewed, being asked if they had
any criticisms on fraternities and if
so, should any action be taken to
correct any faults.

Dr. Spencer

Dr. Edgar W. Spencer, Professor
of Geology has this to say about
fraternities: “First of all, ask the
question, ‘What kind of school do
we want W&L to be?’ Obviously,
there are different answers. A num-
ber of people want an outstanding
academic institution. Other people
want a very elite social club.

“The people who want the school
to be outstanding academically are
generally not very happy with fra-
ternities, one of the principal criti-
cisms being that fraternities play an
extremely important role in the life
of the member, and indirectly in the
lives of non-members. Most of the
social life and extracurricular activ-
ities are controlled by fraternities.
Therefore, fraternities should assume
greater responsibility in intellectual
and academic phases of the univer-
sity. They might establish higher
academic standards for their mem-
bers and lend support to activities
that are not strictly social.

“There are two things, essential-
ly, that could be done to change
the university in the direction of
emphasizing academic life over
social. One thing that could be
done would be to modify the ex-
isting environment by changing
the fraternity system. Possibilities
here would be to institute a defer-
red rushing system or more string-
ent restrictions on fraternity ac-
tivities if the fraternities refuse
to institute reforms of their own.

 

Hollins’ President Speaks Out

Should Colleges Exert Moral Discipline?

(This being National Education
week, The Friday Ring-tum Phi
would like to focus on a major
academic issue—that of education
and morality. Followimg are ex-
cerpts from an address delivered
by President Logan of Hollins at
the institution’s commencement
last June. Editor)

By JOHN A. LOGAN, JR.
President, Hollins College

Americans as a people are given
to critical introspection, and it is
to our credit that despite frequent
public claims to perfection, we are
perpetually engaged in a tireless
analysis of our faults. On the whole
this is a healthy and sobering ex-
ercise, and there is considerable
cause for concern, both in the areas
of public and private morality, if
we survey the evidence.

Pressure To Relax Rules

On college campuses the general
moral flabbiness of our society is re-
flected in the destructive and dis-
turbing riots last spring which can
hardly be passed off as “spring
fever,” or “Vassar students’ strong
negative reaction to Miss Blanding’s
outspoken condemnation of exces-
sive drinking and sexual promis-
cuity, which she accompanied with
a threat of dismissal.” Almost every
college administration reports in-
creasing pressure from students to
relax rules and regulations on
smoking, drinking, cars, visiting
hours, and curfews, while the whole
question of how far the college
should act in loco parentis has been
the subject of heated debate on
campuses across the nation. We are
thus paradoxically confronted with
demands for more freedom in the
fact of a declining acceptance of
responsibility.

At the center of this problem is
the generally sorry condition of
the American family as a focus of
moral authority. Haunted by ill-
digested Freudian strictures against
parental repression, bedevilled by
the “progressive” cult of self-ex-
pression, urged toward permissive-
ness and beguiled by false doctrines
of family democracy, parents have
to often abdicated their responsi-
bility for setting standards of be-
havior and limitations on _ their
children’s freedom of action. Afraid
of inducing trauma, or of being
unpopular with their children or
their children’s friends, they have
yielded to demands for privileges
and liberties which are clearly

 

harmful, and for which the only
excuse is that the other parents al-
low their offspring this license. In
so doing, these adults are robbing
their children of an essential part
of their education by failing to pro-
vide clear measures of right and
wrong and values based on some-
thing firmer than the whims of the
crowd. It is an ethic which says
that because a good many people
are doing something, it is normal
and somehow, therefore, right.

Parents Turn to Schools

Under these circumstances it is
understandable that a great many
parents, aware of the dangers but
helpless to cope with the situation,
have turned to the schools to exert
the guidance and discipline they
cannot provide. I hasten to say that
this is too great a burden to place
on the schools whose main purpose
is, and must remain academic, but
in any case the schools may prove
to be a broken reed. Futhermore,
the school, or college for that mat-
ter can only build on moral foun-
dations that have been firmly laid
at home. There is no substitute for
inner controls and a strong sense
of responsibility. It must be made
clear that rules are made to pro-
tect young people from hurting
themselves, not simply to keep
them from having fun. We must
also rid ourselves of some of our
worship and indulgence of youth and
the false notion that fun is an end
in itself, rather than a by-product
of doing hard things well, or we will
transfer ourselves into a society of
adolescents.

I have been accused of old-fogey-
ism for advocating a return to the
“outmoded” coneept that “father
knows best.” Of course parents are
not infallible, but the odds are with
them. The odds are also with Miss
Blanding against the Vassar students
and no responsible college official
would disagree with her in principle.
The “right to make one’s own mis-
takes” is an absurd rallying cry.
We all make some mistakes unavoid-
ably, but what is the use of studying
the history of human society if each
generation must repeat the errors of
the past? When a mode of behavior
is proved harmful, society prohibits
it. Granted that adults misbehave,
the freedom they enjoy is still cir-
cumscribed, and such freedom as
they have is based on the assumption
of knowledge and experience suffi-
cient to exercise the privilege wisely.
Colleges, therefore, have a legal and

moral duty to parent and student
as well to act in loco parentis.

Never Complete Freedom

I am often stuck by the tendency
of the young to overestimate the
amount of freedom one enjoys as
an adult. Most of you are now pass-
ing through the freest period of
your lives. When you marry you
will enter into a web of obligation to
your husband and children and
through them to the community
that can and should be richly re-
warding, but which will be inces-
santly demanding. Those of you who
pursue careers will be bound to
the restraints of the clock and the
job, deadlines and bosses. Every
human connection imposes respon-
sibilities, real or imagined; every
society makes its demands, sets its
limits, compels its own sort of con-
formity in behavior.

Freedom Through Commitment

The point I am making is that,
paradoxical though it may seem, true
freedom comes through commit-
ment—commitment to people, to
ideas, to causes greater than one-
self. Freedom lies in being able to
choose an area of engagement and
intense interest, it cannot be found
in aimless hedonism or irresponsible
drift. The joys of freedom reside
in using one’s powers to the full
in the service of some worthy en-
terprise that commands all one’s
depth of conviction and devotion.
We are happiest when we are fully
used, and it is the boredom and
frustration of disengagement that
makes us querulous and pety and
mean,

Achieve Through Discipline

No quality is more rare or valu-
able than a capacity for decision
The human mind shrinks from hard
choices, from self-denial and ex-
posed moral positions. The notion of
duty has almost become outmoded
in the modern lexicon linked as it
frequently is with inhibitions and
guilt feelings, until one would
think a sense of obligation is in-
evitably unhealthy. All this is non-
sense, of course. Every enduring
achievement of mankind is the
product of a disciplined mind and
will and imagination. What we have
to deal with at college are the finely
wrought and noble conceptions of
that exceptional discipline we call
genius. It is a wonderful adventure,
and I wish you good fortune in your

 

quest.

change in the character of the stu-
dent body by virtue of their interest,
abilities, and motivation and _ to
eliminate those not interested in
getting as much as they can out of
their college educations.

“This process almost certainly will
take place, even without a univer-
sity policy, simply by virtue of the
inereasing number of college appli-
cants.”

Professor Gunn

Assistant Professor of Commerce
John M. Gunn commented, “First of
all, the fact of living-groups is go-
ing to exist in any residential col-
legiate institution. Now whether
these living groups are organized
formally, or how they are organ-
ized, or what values and tastes they
seek to serve are questions that are
subject to wide variations. I believe
that the particular form of organ-
ization of the American collegiate
fraternity system has enormous po-
tential for the development of col-
lege men as well as for their pleas-
ure. It is also apparent that the
potential for development is little
realized. There are also certain per-
sistant damages in the fraternity sys-
tem and possible dangers.

“Thus the task for fraternity
men is to exploit their opportuni-
ties while supressing the damag-
ing effects. The opportunities es-
pecially consist of the use of the
institution of brotherhood for the
mutual. development—construc-
tive development—of its mem-
bers — their personalities, their
characters, and their intellectual
qualities.

“The harmful effects to be es-
pecially avoided are the damages to
the men not elected by the system
and the creation of false values in
those who are, such as prestige for
prestige’s sake.

“Provided that it could be done
without coersion by the university,
either actual or implied, I would be
delighted by machinery to insure the
opportunity of fraternity member-

 

“A second approach is to admit| ship for every man who wanted it—
only those who would bring about a!

a system undertaken by the frater-
nities themselves because they rec-
ognized the benefits it would have
for the student body as a whole.
Pledge training prgrams could easi-
ly be made more constructive with
total avoidance of obscenities and of
hazardous physical hazing. (The
pledges themselves could put a stop
to such practices simply by refusing
to tolerate them. There is no frater-
nity that could make even a token
fight against pledges refusing to
be abused, especially if the pledges
were a bit organized.)

 

“IT am among those who believe
that a deferred rushing period would
be beneficial provided mechanics
could be worked out that would not
interfere too much with the aca-
demic program of ithe university.”

Dr. Coulling

Finally Dr. S. M. B. Coulling, As-
sociate Professor of English was in-
terviewed: I “think, really, that the
student body is outgrowing frater-
nities, as we’ve traditionally thought
of fraternities as being. Seniors are
increasingly losing their interest in
them, and the attitude of the seniors

Questioned,

Trustees Present ‘Oligarchy’

By ROD COCKSHUTT

What is it that distinguishes an
independent university such as
Washington and Lee from a school
supported and controlled either by
a state or by some religious denom-
ination? This question was raised
during dinner the other evening by
Dr. Samuel E. Stumpf of Vanderbilt,
who lectured on campus this week.

Most of us present at that time
agreed that freedom was the dis-
tinguishing characteristic of the in-
dependent university: the freedom
of professors to teach their subjects
as they choose to; the freedom of
students to follow the truth
wherever and however it might lead
them; the freedom of the university
as a whole to move boldly, to ex-
periment, to play with new ideas—
always without fear of censure by
either legislature, regents, or pa-
rochial hierarchy.

It seems almost too trite to say
that freedom always entails a re-
sponsibility. That responsibility
which the independent university
has is simply to be what it claims
to be; that is, independent. It
ought to exercise constructively and
positively the freedom it enjoys.

 

Otherwise its independence exists in
name only.

Seen in this light we might well
wonder about the nature of Wash-
ington and Lee’s “independence.”
It is evident that rather than being
truly independent, this University
is ultimately and omnipotently con-
trolled by a self-perpetuating oli-
garchy we call the Board of Trus-
tees. The power of decision on all
matters of crucial importance to the
University rests finally with them.
Everything that matters here then
is really at the mercy of their own
economic, social and political views.
There is no fundamental indepen-
dence here.

For instance, when it come to in-
viting Negro leader Dr. Martin
Luther King to campus, our Board
flatly prohibited such an invitation,
despite substantial student and fac-
ulty disapproval of such action. The
University of Virginia, on the other
hand, has permitted not only Dr.
King but also Gus Hall of the Amer-
ican Communist Party, George Lin-
coln Rockwell of the Nazi Party and
other controversial personalities to
speak openly on that campus. Here

Booters Vie In State Tourney

Washington and Lee’s_booters
moved into Charlottesville this
morning with the state’s finest de-
fensive team and highest individual
scorer yet must be content to paly
the darkhorse role in the State Soc-
cer Tournament.

The Generals, ranked number
three behind Virginia and Lynch-
burg College, met  sixth-ranked
VPI this morning at 10 in the open-
ing round of the two-day tourna-
ment, which was started in 1959 by
W&L Coach Joe Lyles. The booters
swept past the Techmen 5-0 during
the regular season and are expected
to do the same today.

If the Generals beat VPI, they
must face the Hornets of Lynch-
burg College. Lynchburg stung W&L
for one of its three regular season
losses and enters the 1 p.m. game
with an 11-2-1 record. “Our boys
are raring to get at Lynchburg,” said
coach Lyles yesterday in a R-t P
interview. “They beat us in the last
four minutes of our first game 1-0.
The main problem with this game
could stem from the fact that we
have to play at 9 am. and again
at 1 p.m. This means our halfbacks
and wings will be running about
fifteen miles in a period of less than
six hours.”

The locals, who have only five
reserves, must hope for a runaway
Tech game in order to rest for the
key encounter with Lynchburg. The
Hornets are a short passing team
who try to tire their opponents.
They are led by high scoring cap-
tain Billy Howard who booted a
final minute goal Tuesday to give
LC a 1-1 tie with Roanoke College,
a team that the Generals desposed of

 

handily Saturday, 4-1.

The W&L-LC game will probably
determine who is to meet defend-
ing state champion, Virginia, in the
finals at 2:30 on Saturday. Virginia
must overcome the winner of the
Roanoke-Randolph-Macon contest.

The Washington and Lee squad,
although only 17 strong, has three
All-Staters from last year— goalie
captain Tom Green, halfback Bruce
Jackson, and center-forward Tim
Henry.

Green has been outstanding this
season allowing only 14 goals in
9 games. He will head the defen-
sive sector of the booters’ squad
which has received state-wide ac-
claim as “very tough.” Fullbacks
Howard Busse and Dave Redmond
are what coach Lyles calls the
“Key to his defense.” They have
performed particularly well making
Green’s job much easier.

Offensively, the Generals have
been helped tremendously by Pre-
ben Berthelsen, a foreign student
from Denmark. “The great Dane”
leads the state in scoring with 9
goals and has provided 5 assists.

 

 

Generals Meet Southwestern

Southwestern comes to Lexington
tomorrow to take on the revenge
seeking Generals in W&L’s final
home game of the season. Against
Sewanee last week the Generals
came out on the short end of a 35-6
decision on the Tiger’s home field.

Still not fully recovered from in-
juries, the Generals will be especial-
ly weak through the center of the

“He can move around players|
while controlling the ball better |
than any other player I’ve ever|
coached,” commented Lyles. “He |
not only moves well but he seems |
to have a knack of hitting the goal
area with almost every shot. He’s
a definite All-Stater.”

Berthelsen combines with Henry
to give W&L one of the state’s
outstanding offensive combinations.
The two have combined to score
over half of the local goals.

Washington and Lee is very strong
on offense and even stronger on
defense. The Generals may decide to

line as they take on the Lynx of
Coach Jessy Johnson. Missing at
guard will be seniors Bill Angel and
Steve Davenport, junior Bo Ernest
and sophomore Tom Day. All except
Angel are expected to be in shape for
the Generals’ final game against
Washington University next week.
Filling in at guard will be senior
Mike Levin and sophomore Charlie
Mayer.

The Generals will be running
against a fairly heavy line, averaging
about 200 pounds and _ especially
strong on the ends. The W&L line
is some what lighter, with not one
man over 200 pounds.

Southwestern has a good running

 

game, but excels in its passing.

Quarterback Bert Chafin has three
prime targets, halfback Scott Halford
and Bill Harwood, and end Vince
Kouns. Chafin is also a fine runner
and will be deadly on the pass-run
option. Harwood, who is also the
Lynx kicker, has found that he
achieves greater distance using
a soecer kick, by which the ball is
booted off the side of his foot.

In past performances Southwestern
has a 2-4-2 record this season and
2-1-1 record against W&L. They
scored 19 points against Washington
and outgained Sewanee in the first
half. But as in the Generals’ en-
counter with the Tigers, the score
was not indicative of the closeness of
the game, the Lynx losing 28-0.

 

Faculty Vs. Students

The W&L faculty will take on the
Fraternity All-Stars in a_ benefit
basketball game at 8:15, December 5.
Admission will be $1 with the pro-
ceeds going to W&L’s charter mem-
bership in the Basketball Hall of
Fame. The event is sponsored by
the Varsity Club.

Frank Parsons will serve as man-
ager of the faculty team, and is
now in the process of contracting
Dr. Keith Shillington as _ coach.
Prospective starters for the facul-
ty include Mr. Baine Fox, Dr. Jay
Cook, Dr. Charles Phillips, and Dr.
Edward Atwood.

Serving as manager of the All-
Stars will be Coach Buck Leslie with
senior law student Wyatt Durette as
the coach. The All-Star team has

Washington and Lee remain singu-
larly silent on this University’s poli-
cy concerning the admission of
Negro students. Here was another
opportunity for Washington and Lee
to demonstrate its independence by
exercising courageous leadership on
a touchy issue. And here again we
failed.

All the new dormitories, dining |
halls, science buildings and research
grants in the world cannot help
Washington and Lee to become a
great University, a force for leader-
ship in the “New South,” if the
spirit of vitality and daring is ab-
sent, as it appears to be, in that
body which possesses ultimate au-
thority over the University.

is increasingly filtering down to the
juniors. Since freshmen can’t partic-
ipate as fully in fraternity activities
as they once could, this leaves fra-
ternities pretty well dominated by
a single class, the sophomores.”

Dr. Coulling explained this de-
creasing undergraduate interest on
the grounds that many members
live in apartments because frater-
nity houses are not such attractive
places to live in as they once were;
today’s students have broader so-
cial interests which take them away
from the house; there are more uni-
versity provided activities such as
lectures, concerts, independent re-
search, and individual interests to
keep students busy; and early mar-

riages take members away from
active participation.
“Fraternities,” continues Dr.

Coulling, “clearly are not what
they once were. This can be borne
out by statistical data: the per-
centage of students who pledge
fraternities in the fall is decreas-
ing, fraternity houses are hav-
ing a more difficult time finding
tenants for all the rooms in the
houses, and I would imagine that
the percentage of really active
membership is decreasing.

‘Fraternities have to face a dual
problem—they must strengthen their
position on campus in the face of
student apathy and in the face of
nationwide _ criticism. Nationally,
fraternities are accused of being un-
democratic” and of being a distrac-
tion at W&L.

“I think that the solution to the
fraternities’ problems is for mem-
bers to mature emotionally and in-
tellectually. Childish hazing, and a
long succession of parties that lead
to satiety becoming boring. When
frantic partying every weekend be-
comes the exclusive form of diver-
sion, a social monotony occurs. At
one time, this kind of fare might
have sufficed, but an increasingly
large number of students are finding
that fraternities are not adequately

satisfying their needs. What I mean
is that the range and interests of
fraternities is limited; the social life
tends to be a monotonous succes-
sion of the same kind of activity. If
the fraternities are really to over-
come student activity, they will have
to think up something besides party
fare.

“The other side of the coin is
meeting the criticism that fraterni-
ties are distractions from what is the
primary importance of academic
life, and I think the way to meet
this criticism is for fraternities to
participate increasingly in the aca-
demic life of the University. Spe-
cifically, they can assist freshmen
in their studies rather than sending
them out on rallies. They can assist
by participating in activities out-
side the classroom, such as lectures,
research projects, and concerts which
are part of the intellectual and cul-
tural life of a university.

“And finally, through a_ variety
of means, such as dinners, recep-
tions, informal coffees, etc., the fra-
ternities can promote a closer and a
warmer relationship among stu-
dents and faculty and then bring
the entire academic community more
closely together.”
