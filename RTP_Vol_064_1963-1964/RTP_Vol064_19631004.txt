OLYMPICS SIGNED FOR COCKTAIL PARTY

Discusses

Wilderness As Theme

By P. R. COCKSHUTT, JR.

William Humphrey, noted novelist
and short story writer and Glasgow
Visiting Professor at Washington and
Lee, discussed the recurring wilder-
ness theme in American literature in
a lecture presented last evening in
the newly renovated Lee Chapel.

The lecture, entitled “Ah Wilder-
ness,” was the first of four public
addresses Humphrey is to give dur-
ing his stay in Lexington this semes-
ter.

Pointing to the absence of any real
heroines in American literature, Mr.
Humphrey suggested that our’s
basically a “bachelor literature, and
a backwoods bachelor literature at
that.”

He proceeded to discuss in some
detail The Leatherstocking Tales of
James Fenimore Cooper, and the
novels’ chief character, Natty Bum-
po, whom Mr. Humphrey character-
ized as a “celibate knight of the
forest.” The speaker sees the Leath-
erstocking series Cooper’s de-
nunciation of the wasteful and des-
troying effect encroaching civiliza-
tion has on nature.

is

as

Mr. Humphrey went on to say that
while historians usually picture this
nation’s westward expansion as part
of the fulfillment of our national
destiny, novelists have chosen to
look upon this expansion as an es-
cape from the fetters of civilized so-
ciety. Consequently, Mr. Humphrey
said, the heroes of our literature are
by nature anti-social. “They are
‘loners’ who lack the Rotarian spirit
and have only a sweeping ‘nay!’ for
all this democratic togetherness we
think of as American.”

Turning to Thoreau as a kind of
philosophical father to this primi-
tivist movement in American liter-
erature, Mr. Humphrey compared
the thought of the hermit of Walden
Pond with that of Rousseau, who
claimed that man is born good, but
is corrupted by society.

The speaker went on to discuss
Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn, the
writings of Jack Kerouac, Herman
Melville, Ernest Hemingway, and
finally, William Faulkner to further
illustrate his thesis that the wilder-
ness theme is and always has been|
of crucial importance in American|
literature.

An informal reception for the au-

 

thor followed the lecture in the

East Lounge of the Evans Dining
Hall.

Mr. Humphrey scheduled to
speak again on the evening of No-
vember 14. His talk has been tenta-
tively entitled “Novelists and Story-
teller.”

The current issues of the Atlantic
Monthly and Esquire magazine con-

is

tain two of Mr. Humphrey’s own
latest short stories. The author’s
other published works _ include

Home From the Hill, a novel, and
The Last Husband, a volume of short
stories.

W&L ‘Mink’ Transfers, Becomes VMI ‘Rat’

By

 

Staff Writer
The Roanoke Times |
Early in September, John Joseph |
Folan, Jr., returned to Lexington |
for his second year of college here.
But instead of re-enrolling at}
Washington and Lee University |
where he had spent his freshman|
term, the 19-year-old Norwood,
Mass., native moved across town to
neighboring Virginia Military Insti-
tute.

He is the first Washington and
Lee man since 1937 to do so
And after nearly one month on

the campus Folan reported:

“So far, ” adding
“T have life

“Jay’- his VMI W&L
friends call him—has become some-
thing of a celebrity at both schools. |
According to Folan:

At VMI—“Sometimes I'll meet
one of them (cadets) and he’ll say,

‘There’s that “mink” (the ‘affection-
ate’ label cadets have given W&L
students) that transferred here.’ ”

At W&L—Last spring, “They
(W&L classmates) didn’t believe I
was going to do it. And are they
surprised to see me now in a VMI
uniform!”

Folan has difficulty in pinpointing
his main reasons for desiring the
transfer.

“IT had once wanted to attend a
military prep school,” he reflected.
And at present, “I am seriously con-
sidering making the military service
my career.”

And at this point, although Fol-
an was forced to accept a “fourth
classman” or freshman academic
standing as he lacked certain nec-
essary credits to become a_ third
classman, he is “not disillusioned”
about his decision.

He says he is far from the perfect
soldier and that in the very near
future “you may see me walking
penalty tours.” Such punishment be- |
gins after a cadet accumulates an
excess number of demerits.

“But that’s part of military life,”

Folan continued, had been

warned of it

saying he

When Folan applied to the VMI
director of admissions last spring,
Col. Arthur M. Lipscomb, Jr., told
|the W&l, freshman that he would
face “no free and easy life’ ‘at VMI.

Col. Lipscomb reealled, “I wasn’t
| trying to discourage him, though;
I felt that it was for his own good.”

Col. Lipscomb said tht several

years ago, a W&L freshman inquired
about a possible transfer

 

to VMI.|

He was a freshman in his first se-
mester. Lipscomb said, and “I ad-
vised him not to do anything pre-|
maturely;” whereupon the student|
remained at W&L and is a candidate |
for graduation there this year.
The admissions offices of both
institutions report that although
indeed rare, transfers from VMI
to W&L are “much more frequent”
than vice versa. One cadet, after
two years at the institute, changed
to Washington and Lee this year.

As opposed to his predecessor of |
26 years back, however, Folan said
he wanted to attend VMI.

As he in his barracks room
and diligently shined the brass hat
shield, Folan discussed what he
termed a “sincere admiration” for
VMI.

There was time, he
that he had heard of the institute
“only vaguely,” probably he said, |
because the Keydet football teams |
had played games with Boston Col-

and Bill Edmunds, and they invited
me over to VMI on several week- |
ends.”

It was at this time that Folan, as-
to become a cadet, visited
the VMI admissions office. He said
Gen. Lloyd Davidson, dean of the
faculty, “told me I probably had a
chance to see the institute
than any other
ever entered here.”

later, as he did not take certain
courses at Washington and Lee that
VMI fourth-classmen need in order
to advance to a third-class ranking.

Currently in what is almost a uni-

que position, Folan in speaking of
the two schools was able to con-
clude:

“I think good relations (between
W&L and VMI) are important—
we're in the same town, and using
the same facilities,

“There appears to be a mutual re-

spect between the two; there is cer-
no great rivalry (athletic con-
pitting VMI and Washington
Lee ended long ago). There

His philosophical views on the dif-
between the student and the
cadet: in short, none. As he sum-

Products Of Frisch, Marlowe and Shaw

It concerns the well-known apathy
of modern man to the destructive
and evil forces in the world today.
Some have also seen in the play, a
warning by Frisch to his Swiss com-
patriots to beware in particular the
Communist evil.

This production will run Nov. 6-9.

By way of commemorating the

/ 400th anniversary of the birth of

the two greatest tragic playwrights
in the English language Christopher
Marlowe and William Shakespeare,
the Troubs will produce Marlowe's
best known work, The Tragical His-
tory of Dr. Faustus. The theatre also
now plans a Shakespearian produc-
tion for the fall of 1964.

Marlowe’s lines are, of course,
credited with establishing blank
verse as the poetic foundation of
inglish tragedy. And in Faustus he
created the figure who has come to
typify the search of Renaissance
man. This show is scheduled to be
presented March 518.

As the final production this sea-
son, the theatre has chosen Ber-
nard Shaw’s Androcles and the Lion.
This, too is a fable play but of a
different kind from Biedermann. It
is high comedy.

The familiar legend of man and
beast is treated by Shaw here. But
as with all legends used by Shaw,
it is highly modified. This spring
production is slated for April 29-
May 2.

Hollins Is Host |
To WGL UCA

Hollins College will be hostess to
a group of W&L students this Sun-
day afternoon,

The meeting will launch a series
of get-togethers to take place dur-
ing the year for the purpose of dis-
cussion. The program adminis-
tered under the auspices of the Uni-
versity Christian Association.

A similar program has been estab-
lished with Sweet Briar and Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman’s College. The
representatives to these colleges are
now being organized and students
who

is

are interested may contact Ken
Lane, UCA vice-president.
The discussion groups were ini-|

tiated two years ago by represen-
tatives from Hollins and W&L. The
purpose of the program is to
strengthen the liaison between W&L |
and neighboring girls’ colleges.

President Moore

Appoints Veeps

By LEWIS MILLER
The Olympics, nationally famous
recording stars, have been selected
by John Moore, President of Open-
ings Dance Weekend, to appear at
the Openings cocktail party spon-
sored by the Sophomore class. Ac-
companying the Olympics will be
Guitar Kimber and the Untouch-
ables. Date and time of the cocktail
party will be Friday, October 19,
from four to six in the evening. As
in the past, the Pine Room of the
Mayflower Motor Hotel will be used

to accommodate the crowd.

Bourbon and Scotch
Breaking away from the traditional
grain punch, mixed drinks of Bour-
bon and Scotch will be served. Mem-
bers of the student body and their
dates are invited to attend the first
cocktail party of the school year.

Announced

Along with the announcement of
the cocktail party entertainment,
John Moore, President of the Soph-
omore class, has announced the ap-
pointment of seven vice-presidents
for Openings Weekend.

Chuck Griffin, SAE, is the official
coordinator for the weekend. Rob
Vaughn, Delt, is in charge of the
decorations for the Friday night
dance and the Saturday night con-
cert. Steve Yancy, Beta, will handle
the arrangements for the figure at
the Friday dance. Dave Sufflebarger,
PiKA, and Chip Roadman, Phi Gam,
are in charge of the invitations which
will be sent to friends of the Uni-

Vice-Presidents

xVersity, the faculty, and the digni-

taries of Lexington. Lewis Miller,
Phi Delt, is the Publicity chairman
for Openings Weekend. Lindsay
Short, Delt, is in charge of the cock-
tail party.
The Olympics

The Olympics, for the last five
years, have been one of the most
successful rock and roll singing
groups in the country, their songs
have consistently been at, or near,
the top of the national record polls.
The Olympics, singing in a style re-
sembling the Coasters, first received
acclaim with their single release of
“Western Movies.”

Since then, the Olympics have
recorded such hits as “Big Boy
Pete,’ and “The Bounce.” Their
most recent release, “Dancin’ Hol-
iday,” is still listed in the top one
hundred songs in the nation. Aside
from their single releases, the
Olympics have recorded three
best selling albums.

Guitar Kimber and the Untouch-
ables are well known in both the
individual, and back-up field. Reggie
“Guitar” Kimber, as the name sug-
gests, is an accomplished guitarist,
styling himself after Bo Diddley
and Chuck Berry. Both the Olym-
pics and Guitar Kimber appeared
on campus last Finals and were a
tremendous success in n Red Square.

 

Sazeracs Group

Holds Audition

Washington and Lee’s ten-year-
old social singing fraternity, the
Sazeracs, has held try-outs during
the past week to fill its few vancan-
cies. John Baker, business manager
of the Sazeracs, has announced that

the group still needs baritones and
tenors, however.
Each year the social calendar of

the Sazeraes is crowned by a spring
trip to Palm Beach, Florida, where
for the past two years the group has
had engagements at the Taboo Club,
one of the most outstanding clubs
in the city. Last year the Sazeracs
also gave private concerts for the
prince and princess of Austria as
well as for Zsa Zsa Gabor.

Other

engagements last year in-
cluded concerts at Sweet Briar, Mary

Baldwin, Madison, and Southern
Seminary (where the group was re-
ceived with a warm welcome). The

Suggestion Follows Criticism

As a follow-up to last week’s editorial against beanies, the
Friday Edition this week ventures a suggested replacement for
the kiddie caps. There are many different methods of identi-
fying a man as a freshman; if one of these is used to replace
the beanie, it should be one which accomplishes the same
purpose while lending some dignity to the process. A method
which fulfills these requirements very well is to have the fresh-
men wear name tags of the same type they wear to the recep-
tion at the President’s home. These tags, which are made for
the use of the alumni association, fit handily into a gentleman’s
front coat pocket. They could be covered with plastic to make
them more durable.

The cards would carry the advantage of identifying a
freshman by name, not just by class. If identification really
is the purpose of the beanie, then the cards are an improve-
ment. Lower cost is still another advantage of cards over
beanies

Beanies could be discarded without losing any traditional
value. Their demise involves a question not of principle but of
policy. Nothing could be simpler than for the student govern-
ment to initiate the use of identification cards next year, thereby
improving the freshman assimilation program and ridding the
W&L campus of its most ridiculous sight.

Can We Pick It Up?

Despite the splendid performance of the Generals last
Saturday, freshmen and visitors spectating their first WeL
game must have felt they were attending a funeral service.
The lack of cheering and enthusiasm was downright disgusting.

The Five Stars have every right to our postive backing.
They slave hard in preparing for these games and from a self-
interest point of view, the time they sacrifice could be more
pleasantly spent dating or flicking out. : ;

Realizing the emergency of this need, the Varsity Club is
sectioning off the seats behind the band just for those who want
to cheer. This section is only for that hardy breed who think
they can hold up under the strain; the peace-loving or shy
spectators are advised to move to one side.

To give added inspiration to this elite of students and dates,
cheerleaders are being solicited from Southern Seminary.

For those of you who feel hesitant to join this movement,
we venture a warning: if your date doesn’t find any excitement
at W&L football games, she might give you up for a Wahoo!

this unfortunate conflict between
Church and state might never have

honest with himself must admit that
there is no such thing as the pro-
hibition of prayer. Surely the God
these men describe can take care of
Himself, and it is to be hoped that
he takes care of His own.

Certainly Christianity will not
stand or fall because the Bible is

I sense a curious inconsistency,
perhaps even hypocrisy, in the re-

of prayers and Bible reading in the
public schools, they turn full circle

of our Federal government is en-

These self-styled “Patriotic

claim that the Supreme Court of
the United States “has put the
Negroes in the schools and taken

their complaint more carefully we
can see how two-faced it really is.

How can intelligent men claim that
they see no moral or religious issues
at stake in the deprivation of hu-
man rights to a portion of our popu-
lation? And how can these same
men suddenly become pillars of the
Church, modern-day Christian sol-

For three students at W&L this
year college life is especially com-
plex and trying. In addition to the
already difficult curriculum and
scholastic requirements, these three
men find themselves suddenly
thrown into a completely different
type of society. The three foreign
representatives here this year are
Preben Berthelsen from Aalborg,
Denmark, Anders Henricsson from
Stockholm, Sweden, and Giancarlo
Marchetti from Rome, Italy.

The main difference between their
universities back home and W&L is
that here social life is intertwined

such as fraternities in their uni-
versities; nor do the students live
there at college, as they do here.
Their one purpose is education. Even
in this field the classes differ from
ours. They voluntarily attend lec-
tures and when they feel that they
know the material, they take the
exam.

is that they have been impressed
by everyone’s friendliness and un-
derstanding toward them. Carlo, as
he is known here, also has com-
mented about the honesty of every-
one.

Rach has at first found some diffi-
culty in understanding professors
during their lectures, but say that
now it seems easier for them. Hav-
ing to think and talk English all
the time definitely improves their |
comprehensibility.

Preben Berthelsen

Preben is presently taking two!
junior and thre

 

e sophomore courses. |
Along with English he is taking
American Civilization, American Lit-
erature, History, and Political Sci-
ence. He has had four years of
English and two of English Litera-
ture. He applied to the International
Institute of Education to come to
an American school. On the basis
of his knowledge of the English
language, he was selected and found |
out he was coming in April. He ar-
rived in the States early in Sep-
tember and visited New York City,

Anders Henriesson

Anders has attended thé Univers-
ity of Stockholm for one year, but
has studied English for nine. Like
Preben he is on the soccer team.
The Honor System has made the
biggest impact on him during his
first few weeks here. He comments,
“I think it’s wonderful to live under |
such a system. I never thought that
such a system exists anywhere in
the world where you can trust
everybody and have people trust
you.”

He said that he enjoyed rush
week, meeting all the people and
getting a chance to learn about the
American way of college life. Like
Preben and Carlo, he was impressed
by everyone’s friendliness to him
and their understanding. He said
you could talk to teachers more
easily here than in Sweden. In

concentrating on law, he can finish
his requirements much faster than
one can over here.

Although he has only taken Eng-
lish for four years, he got his schol-
arship on the basis of his knowledge
of the English language and his
ability to speak it. He explains his

The Great Escape is super-enter-

tension and melodrama of a Holly-

gory, it is matched in my memory
only by Stalag 17 and The Counter-
feit Traitor. Yet the suspense that
Sturges so skillfully manipulates
betrays itself when compared to the
other—and — greater—escape _ that
opens Sunday at the Lyric. David

in the human psyche that its senario
becomes a very personal matter.

a few moments (or hours) at one

 

time or another? Who is so sophis-
ticated as to spurn the relief that
comes when you know that some-

When David and Lisa reach this
catharsis, their fulfillment bursts
on the audience in a cataract of
empathy; it is a unfortunate person
indeed who cannot find it within
his own artificiality to share their
happiness. I am not prepared to
agree with foreign critics who said

Letters To The Editor .. .

 

 

October 2, 1963
Dear Editor,

I came to this country last spring
from France to pass a year here,

Cinema Verite. Partly by chance,

Foreign Students Express Their Views
On W&L Honor System, Social Life

 

tthelsen, Anders Henricsson, and Giancarlo Marchetti.

due to the fact that over there
they teach more grammar than con-
versation. In addition, he spent a
summer in England.

He is taking Political Science,
French, American Literature, Amer-
ican History, Sociology and English
259. Although he has confessed some
difficulty in understanding all the
lectures, he feels optomistic about
increasing his understanding as he
becomes more adjusted to his classes
and professors.

Like Anders, Carlo has been very
much impressed with the honor sys-
tem here. Of it he says, “Yes, it is
strong, you know, but then, it is
necessary for a society such as this
one here.”

Carlo does not see much differ-
ence between Italian girls and
American girls. He says, “Love is
the same all over when you really
look at it.” However, he remarks
that he has found American girls
especially gentle and understanding.
“You can’t take anything away from
Italian girls, though.”

This year marks the first year in
which foreign students have both
lived and eaten in fraternity houses.
The policy in the past has been for
the students to live in the dormitory
and eat at various houses. The
change was made to allow the stu-
dents to become better acquainted
with W&lL. life.

 

Hi omecomings
Minus Minks

By DREW BAUR

As usual this time time of the year
thirteen seat-sore juniors are seen
carrying pillows and Ben-gay to
class and elsewhere. Even though
some of them (Tom) don’t remem-
ber why they are tender, be kind
to them anyway, for these are the
new “13” Club initiates. Unfortu-
nately they will be putting on a one
club display during homecomings
next week.

As everyone knows the fabled
Mongolian Minks will sit this one out
in the stands again this year. Despite
heavy losses by graduation the
Minks are looking forward to an-
other fine year under the new caliph,
Scary McFall. Because of the natur-
al rivalry between the school’s two
most beloved and respected organ-
izations, it seems a shame to have
this worthwhile group confined to
the shadows of the stands rather than
the bright sunlight of the playing
field. Oh well, carry on a noble tra-
dition 13ers, the Minks may stage
a comeback between halves of the
intramural touch football champion-
ship game.

To the Freshmen

Now upon you beanie-wearers is
the freshman class election, Prepare
to be disillusioned about the political
system at W&L. Don’t forget to com-
plain to the Ring-tum Phi and your
teachers about the wicked fraterni-
ties telling you pledges how to vote.
Then remember to bring it upon
yourselves to save the political sys-
tem at W&L and put it back into
the hands of the pure and good and

Coach Lyles Introduces Bootmen
To New Platoon System For R-MC

This Friday Coach Lyles’ soccer
men hope to continue on their win-
ning ways against Randolph-Macon.
Last week’s 3-2 victory over Pfeif-

fer made it two wins in a row, the}
first being a 3-0 win over Randolph- |
Macon in the state tournament last

season. In another game earlier in
the season Washington and Lee beat
Randolph-Macon 4-0 in an
game.

In light of Washington and Lee’s
slow start last week, which found
Pfeiffer with a 2-0 lead in the sec-
ond quarter, Lyles has worked the
team hard in an attempt to improve

conditioning and sharpen all around | {

performance.

Lyles will put to work his platoon
system this week for the first time
along with his usual shifting of
players to different positions. Ber-

thelsen and Kilpatrick will form a)

relief platoon for the other two in-
siders Clark and Sweet. In the back-
field Darden, Warner, Jackson, and
Horner will combine in two half
platoons.

With only six extra men on the
team this system is very useful as
the team works well with each com-
bination. The other two reserves are
at full back and goalie.

The outlook is promising this week

The Generals of Washington and
meet the Crimson and Gold

Yeomen of Oberlin this Saturday |

2 p.m. This is the second game for
both teams. Last Saturday the Ober-
lin team suffered a crushing 52-0

defeat at the hands of Hiram College, |

possibly one of the best small col-
lege teams in the nation today.
Nevertheless, the Yeomen will be
fighting hard to regain their lost

stature. As Coach Buck Leslie says: |

“Don’t look back and don’t look for-
ward.” Both teams go into the game
with the score board reading 0-0;
it’s the team that hits and plays the
hardest that makes the points. All
week long Coach Mac has been
warning his team that an opponent
can bounce back from a loss to the
point of completely overridding its
adversary.

The Oberlin team is a veteran
team. They have twenty-four re-
turning lettermen, including ten of
last year’s starters. They play ball
in a very rugged Ohio Valley Con-

ference and the experience that its|

twenty-four returnees boast is for-
midable. Although the Yeomen only

Sports Experts: Tax Your Cranium| W&L Generals Set To Go

jured in last wek’s game with Ran-
dolph-Macon, the squad is ready to
go. Sylvester and Flournoy will most
likely be ready also and have been
working out with their regular units
all week. Both had outstanding per-
formances against the Yellow Jack-
ets, and will be a great aid to the
Generals on Saturday.

All three units of the W&L team
are “up” for this game and are most
anxious to show the newcomers from
the Ohio Valley what kind of foot-
ball Virginians can play. As tackle
Jack Kelly puts it: “I can’t wait
to get my hands on one of ‘dem
guys’.” This is the general spirit of
the team. Not that they want to
physically maim Oberlin, they just
want to show them who is boss.

The General’s offense has picked
up more steam in practice and will
be hard to contain. It will be inter-
esting to compare this week’s Gen-
erals to the same team last week.
This statement is to mollify all indi-
viduals that the team’s defense was
sadly lacking against Randolph-
Macon.

The ‘13’ Club Renews Tradition
By Initiating 13 New Members

Every morning at the stroke of

dent going to a class on the colon-
nade can see thirteen juniors in a
quasi-grovel position chanting some-
thing like “12345678910 misterames

members of the Thirteen Club are
named forwards and backwards and
a Cape Canaveral type countdown is
dispensed with. Besides the almost
