Sem Cheerleaders Arouse
Team, Crowds At Games

By BRUCE WHELIHAN

For the past two weeks, as reg-
ular attendants at Wilson Field are
aware, six girls from Southern Sem-
inary have cheered the Generals
to victory. Wearing cheerleader
sweaters and adorned with corsages
by the Varsity Club, the girls hop
and holler to arouse the crowd.

The six young women are all
seniors and cheerleaders for the
Athletic Society in Buena Vista.

Medical Association, and they will be
administered at eight places in Rock-
bridge County and Buena Vista.

Lexington High School
For W&L students, the
venient place would be Lexington High
School, where the tablets will be avail-
able from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.
Sabin oral vaccine will be used, ac-
cording to Dr. Benjamin P. Anderson,
medical director of the clinics. It is
given on a small cube of sugar and
provides a painless, tasteless method
of immunization.

» Chosen Queen
; Of Weekend

By ROBERT RADCLIFF
Staff Reporter

Miss Carol Bruce was crowned
Homecoming Queen of 1963 during
the htlf-time intermission at Sat-
urday’s football game. Mis Bruce,
a senior at Stephens College in
Columbia, Missouri is majoring in
retailing and business administra-
tion. She was escorted by Mr. Jim
DeYoung of Phi Kappa Sigma .

Representatives of eighteen fra-
ternities participated in the contest.
The eighteen candidates underwent
macroscopic scrutiny by four facul-
ty members. The Alumni donated
Miss Bruce’s crown and boquets for
all the attendants to the court.

500 Grads Rturn

This year about 500 alumni and
their families, as compared with
about 430 alumni last year, atended
the homecoming procedings and the
rededication of Lee Chapel. Home-
comings was plannd by Dr. E. F.
Turner and W. C. Washburn. Ac-

* cording to Mr. Washburn the rededi-

| cation of Lee Chapel was responsible
fo rthe larger turnout of out-of-
state alumni than in_ preceding
years .

Post-Game Reception

A post-game reception for the
alumni was held this year instead of
a cocktail party so that the alumni
would have the opportunity to meet
the coaches and captains of the foot-
ball team. The reception was quite
successful as it was well attended
and the possibility exists for such
a receptio nnext year.

The highlight of the Alumni
Homecoming was the rededication of
Lee Chapel. The newly renovated
structure was praised by the alumni
as they toured the Chapel and Mu-
seum. Mr. Washburn was quite
pleased” with the proceedings of
the weekend.

 

 

NOTICE

Dr. Turner has also announced that
/numerous scholarships for graduate
study are available to rising seniors,
for study at the University of Hawaii.

The first play of the Troubadour
Theatres 1963-64 season, Biedermann
and the Firebugs, is well into pro-

6-9. Dr. Cecil Jones, Professor of
Fine Arts and Director of the Troub-
adours, announces that the first
show this year will feature a cast
of 18, including seven actors who
will be making their first appearance
on the Troubadour stage.

Called both a provocative satire
and a slapstick farce, The Firebugs

 

recorded three long playing albums.

is a recent work of the German-
language playwright Max Frisch. It
involves the confrontation of a pros-
perous yet cowardly German busi-
ness man, Gottlieb Biedermann, with
two uninvited guest who have come
to burn down his home and the rest
of his town. Concerned only with)
saving himself, Biedermann attempts
appeasement in dealing with the
two arsonists only to discover
he has aided them in his own des-
truction.

Tim Dols Plays

Tim Dols,

Lead

a senior, will play

title role of Gottlieb Biedermann,
the wealthy, cowardly, middle-class
citizen who disdains the unpleas-

antness that a fight with evil forces
would necessarily involve him. Mrs.
Yvonne Dickens, wife of David B.
Dickens, Professor of German, will
play Babette Biederman, Gottlieb’s
wife, whose apathy maks her equal-
ly guilly of the outcome. Together
they unwittingly fall prey to the
evil plans of the Firebugs.

The arsonists, Willi Eisinring
and Sepp Schmitz, will be played by
Steve Colvin and Joe Volpe. Both
roles are seen as contrasting views
of evil: the sauve and subtle ex-
head waiter, and the not-so-stupid,
brutal wrestler. It is their antics
and witty and double talk which
so bewilder Biedermann that he
becomes an accomplice to the very
crime he is try to prevent: the des-
truction of his own home.

The Ghee Of ee Past

It was in November of 1956 that the Interfraternity
Council voted through a resolution which limited to five
the number of houseparties which could be held on an
off-weekend. This action was taken, we presume, to molli-
fy the townsfolk, to lessen the task of Proctor Murray in
supercising a party weekend, and very simply to hold with-
in a reasonable limit the number of parties on campus
during the school year.

The rule has been a very good one with one excep-
tion. There are eighteen fraternities on campus; there
are three weekends in December, at the most, on which
Christmas parties can be held. This has meant that three
fraternities have had to schedule their Christmas affairs
out of season. This year there are only two available
weekends for parties between Thanksgiving and Christ-
mas, which made the IFC painfully aware of the need for
modification of the old rule.

Last Friday afternoon the problem was solved for this
year by the Faculty Committee on Fraternities. At the
request of IFC president Art Broaddus, the Committee
voted to allow all eighteen fraternities to hold their Christ-
mas parties on one of the two weekends available in De-
cember.

Two stipulations go along with this allowance: the
houses must agree amongst themselves through the IFC
to hold nine parties one weekend and nine the next; and
all parties must be closed, and must remain closed, during
the entire course of the party.

We wish to point out that it is because of the fore-
sight of IFC president Broaddus that this measure has
been passed. The Faculty Committee on Fraternities has
always been willing to listen to such a proposal, but the
IFC has been remiss in presenting it.

Last year, a proposal went before the Faculty Com-
mittee, but it came too late in the fall to be considered
and voted upon. Fraternities therefore owe their Christ-
mas parties not only to the consideration of the Faculty
Committee, but to Art Broaddus, for presenting the prob-
lem enough in advance for it to receive proper attention.

 

Buy More Dance Plans

Dance Plans go on sale for the last time this week.
Representatives from the Dance Board will be present
during the lunch hour at all fraternity houses.

We would remind students that the Dance Board
does not belong to Ed Croft or to the Dance Board Ad-
visory Committee. It belongs to the students themselves,
and as much or as little can be done by Croft and those
who assist him as the students will allow.

Those who are holding out on buying a Dance Plan
to disappoint the Dance Board will only wind up hurting
themselves. Ray Charles cannot be hired unless the vast
majority of the student body has supported the year-long
plan of the Dance Board.

Boycotters would do well to take a second thought and
consider the damage that would be done to the prestige
of Washington and Lee’s social life should they persist.

‘Birdie Panned As Poor,
But Typical Of Musicals

By TOM PACE

A critical statement of sorts. It would be my desire to spend each
week writing a major work or an attempt at real cinematic art.
I would like nothing better than to have a “Jules and Jim” (pro) or
a “Manchurian Candidate” (con) to review every Tuesday. How-
ever, relatively few of these films are made each year, the majority
of films being comparable to second and third rate literature. It
is the plight of the self-appointed movier-goer to while away his
valueless time watching many of these poorer movies, and the
plight of self-appointed critics to write about them. It is not my
fervent wish that each of you develop a new high personal standard
of criticism. That is dependent on each individual’s own interest.
Rather I would merely give my own opinion of the film and explain
as best I could why I felt however I did feel. Unfortunately most
weeks are rather bare movie-wise and I am unable to force myself
to writ an entire column on any one film. Thus I have excused
the following column.

The Fault of Musicals

“Bye Bye Birdie” affords a remarkably apt illustration of why
musicals never quite seem to go on the screen. Though sometimes
the music alone might prove entertaining to many, the idea behind
a musical seems to be not to leave the music alone. Instead each
song must be acted out, and usually very poorly. The fact that the
only successful portions of this film are when the principals do
nothing but sing, points out precisely this major fault in all musicals.
(For, in fact, I can’t remember seeing an honestly great musical
ever, though this may surprise admirers of “West Side Story.”)

Nonetheless I must admit there were some attractive things
about “Bye Bye Birdie.” Ann-Margaret’s opening, when she sings
the title song, hints that there are better things to come, which sadly
never do. Also Jessie Pearson’s characterization of Conrad Birdie
is nearly worth the price of admission alone. Yet Bobby Rydell,
Ann-Margaret, Janet Leigh, and Dick Van Dyke in that order are
very disappointing.

New French Film

At the Lyric now is a French film entitled “Tomorrow is My
Turn” which, if nothing else, is a suggestive title. I have not seen
the film, but plan to because of its advanced billing. Several critics
have squandered praise on it, so hopefully there is something in
it.

It’s Nice To Be Normal

Once we had eaten and were lying down on the
ground I looked up through the trees at one star and
I tried to concentrate so hard on it that I began to be
hypnotized and the star got blurry and a lot bigger
and the hemlock trees with the fire reflecting on them
reminded me of Christmas. I was trying so hard to
experience the moment for the moment’s sake and not
something to remember and write about and I was at
the same time wondering why people never paint
picture of trees while they are underneath them look-
ing up and also remembering a time when I had been
in Florida and my mother had gotten a ticket for
running a red light and the cop had pulled us off the
road under the same kind of trees when Nick asked
me where the cigarettes were. Somebody will always
ask you something like that when you don’t want them
to.

Before the night had come and the sun had been
shining on the leaves of the poplar trees above the
hemlocks, the leaves had been bright yellow and green
and red; but when the sun was low they stopped
being that way and instead reminded me of helium
balloons at the cireus which are held back from going
into the sky by the top of the big tent after the show
is over. It was really sad then and the air reminded
me of prep school in the late fall dusk, but later
darkness came, and I couldn’t see the leaves of the
tall trees any more so I stopped thinking about them,
and instead concentrated on the hemlock’s web-like
branches that were glowing white on the underneath
side which reminded me, As I said of Christmas. It’s
nice to be normal at Christmas.

W&L Coach Does Summer Duty

 

Coach Lord Makes Army Tour

By GARETH ADEN
Feature Editor

It is likely that few Washington
and Lee students realize that coach
Norman F, Lord of the schools phy-
sical education department is “one
of the nation’s foremost authorities
on the organization and conduct of
intramural sports,”

As proof of this statement, coach
Lord was selected by the United
States Army to travel in Germany,
France, and Italy last summer. The
trip was generally to evaluate the
army’s intramural programs in
camps in these countries, and lasted
from the beginning of July through
the first week in August.

The illustrious coach, of both
track and freshman camp fame,
said he felt the vital purpose of
the trip was “to promote more uni-
versal participation in Army in-
tramural sports; so that all sol-
diers, not just the expert athlete,
could benefit from sports partici-
pation.” The goal, he added, was
the goal of college intramural pro-

 

grams as well, “Boys just don’t
realize it, that’s all.”

Coach Lord said that the first part
of the tour was devoted specifically
to traveling from camp to camp and
observing the intramural programs
at each. From this observation he
drew up a personal report with sug-
gested changes and sent this report
to Washington.

During the last two weeks of the
trip, Lord said that he and Mr. Rob-
bert Baird, a civilian consultant for
the Southern European Task Force,
held clinics conducting intramural
sports. He explained that four clin-
ics in all were held; one in Orleans,

France, and the other three in the
German towns of Frankfort, Bad
Tolz, and Kaiserslantern.

With a wry smile, the track men-
tor pointed out that the clinics were
very similar to a school in schedule
and routine. Classes ran from 8
am. to 5 p.m., and were attended
by athletic commanders from the
surrounding camps.

"I tried to impress upon them.”
said Lord, “The importance of
everyone’s participation in sports,
especially the less-athletic soldier.
The benefits of previous sports
competition to military and com-

Thursday

October 10
Tonight I had the misfortune to
attend a fraternity “rally,” or pledge
hazing session. I saw leering, half-
drunk upperclassmen shouting and
screaming at near-exhaused fresh-
men who continue to submit them-
selves to further inane indignities.
Some fraternities have had the
maturity to abolish these pointless
sessions of sadism and replace them

with constructive pledge training
programs.
Others continue to show their

lack of imagination and blind devo-
tion to a stupid tradition by re-
fusing even to try a more intelli-
gent alternative.

I can’t help wondering how all
this is reconciled to the idea of the
“W&L gentleman.”

Everyone who attended the Re-
dedication of Lee Chapel was most
impressed with the service as a
whole, and particularly with the
Glee Club’s performance.

The Glee Club’s singing of Col-
lege Friendships especially impress-
ed many alumni, and rightfully so.

My only regret was that the Uni-
versity felt compelled to outlaw
Homecoming displays for fear of de-
tracting from the dignity of the re-
dedication.

In the past displays have not only
helped spark student interest in
Homecomings, but have been an ex-
cellent means of cooperation among
the various pledge classes.

The game today was an exciting
one, despite the wide margin of
W&L’s win.

An administration official of im-
portance was overheard commenting
on the good behavior of the crowd
at the game .

I agreed, and think it really should
be a matter of pride that when
Washington and Lee men are gather-
ed as a crowd, they generally are
quite well behaved.

Sackett Shines At Homecomings

By JIM CROTHERS
Assistant Sports Editor

Somewhat overshadowed in previ

ous games, halfback Henry Sackett

broke loose Saturday at Homecoming scoring 16 points and gaining 101

yards in ten carries, to lead Washin
Centre College (Ky.) in a College A
the Generals’ third victory this sea-*
son and extends their undefeated
string to eight straight over two
seasons.

Sackett kept two W&L drives alive
with jaunts of 33 and 34 yards and
helped get the Generals’ first scor-
ing thrust started by returning Cen-
tre’s first punt 26-yards to midfield.
From where Washington and Lee
marched to the Colonel 1-yard line
where Stuart Yoffe skirted end for
the tally and his forth TD of the
year. Sackett then added the two-
point conversion to give the Gen-
erals an 8-0 lead midway through
the first quarter.

Second Score

The second W&L score was set up
when Yoffe intercepted a Centre
aerial and carried it to the Colonel
37. Sackett, on the first play, swept
end and literally ran over several
would-be tacklers to bring the ball
to the Centre 3-yard line. Three
plays later the Lynchburg resident
tallied his first touchdown giving
Washington and Lee a_ half-time
lead of 14-0, after a two-point con-
version failed.

Yoffe, W&L’s candidate for Little
All-American, ran the opening
second-half kickoff back to the
Centre 48 and a personal foul moved
the ball to the Colonel 33. Sackett
scored his second TD of the after-

Red Unit Drives

Late in the third period, after
stopping a Centre drive, Washington |
and Lee’s red unit drove 87 yards
in 18 plays for the final General
score. A fifteen-yard roughing the
kicker penalty began the drive and
quarterback, A. J. Barranco, then
relied on passes to halfback Bill
David to keep the thrust alive. With
7:50 left in the game, Barranco hit
David, the General’s leading pass-
receiver, on the 11 where he sped
over for the touchdown.

Centre scored its lone tally on a
one-yard plunge by halfback John
Murphy, and a two-point conver-
sion pass from E. Jackson to Mark
Lindsay late in the fourth quarter.
A final scoring drive by W&L’s gold
unit was thwarted by an intercepted

Harriers Trip
Eagles, 18-43;

O’Conner 1st'®

By LARRY CRAIG
Tuesday Sports Writer
The Washington and Lee cross-
country team rang up a runaway
voctory Saturday by easily defeating
a strong Bridgewater team 18-43.

This victory was the Generals’ first | faMgaam

over the Eagles, but was their third
straight without a loss this season.

Riff O’Conner ran first with his
best time, 25:00 minutes over the
hilly General 4.1 mile course. Andy
Kilpatrick, harrier captain for the
1963 season, finished second with
the time of 25:25; and Lee Johnson
crossed the finish line fourth in
25:26 minutes.

W&L bunched its first five men
within 1:01 minutes, and the initial
seven were separated by only 1:10
minutes. As has been the case in
the previous two meets, the Gener-
als’ exceptional depth provided the
margin of victory. It is this depth
on which Coach Dick Miller places
his hopes for victory against Old
Dominion this week.

This year’s team presents quite a
paradox. There isn’t a senior on the
W&L roster, but Coach Dick Miller
will field a veteran squad; there is
General fans will see a high-spirited
no record-breaker on the team, but
team.

There is an old saying that history
always repeats itself and unfor-
tunately the Washington and Lee
soccer team found this saying quite
accurate. The Generals dropped a
2-1 decision to North Carolina State
Thursday at N. C. State. Two years

| ago when Wé&L invaded the den of

the Wolfpack the result was a 1-0
defeat for the Generals with the

actly the same as two years ago. Un-
believable.”

Generals Lead
The Generals jumped off to a lead
midway in the first quarter when
Mell set up Steve Hibbard about
four yards from the goal. Hibbard
netted it to account for all of the
W&L scoring.

 

Soccer Team Suffers First Defeat;
Hibbard Scores Lone W&L Goal

The 1-0 lead held up until the
third quarter when the Wolfpack
came through with the tying and
winning goals. The first came on a
perfect set up pass by Artinano
to Ferrand, who scored from about
15 yards. Alencastro tallied the win-
ning goal about nine minutes later.
He booted in a loose ball from about
two yards out .

The Generals had no individual
stars in this losing effort, but did not
lose because of poor playing either.
It was a great team effort, but the
breaks went against them. Actually,
the winners showed a rather un-
coordinated team effort in the rough
game that saw many fouls called.
W&L just missed too many shots.

Explanation
Coach Lyles had his explanation
for the defeat. “They had better
passing than we did, as I expected.
We don’t take off with the ball
quickly enough and then we don’t
pass quickly enough.”

On Campus sc?s0

(By the Author of ‘Rally Round the Flag, Boys!” and,
“Barefoot Boy With Cheek.’’)

BOOM!

Today, foregoing levity, let us turn our keen young minds to
the principal problem facing American colleges today: the
population explosion. Only last week four people exploded in
Cleveland, Ohio—one of them while carrying a plate of soup.
In case you’re thinking such a thing couldn’t happen anywhere
but in Cleveland, let me tell you about two other cases last
week—a 45-year-old man in Provo, Utah, and a 19-year-old
girl in Northfield, Minnesota. And, in addition, there was a
near miss in High Point, North Carolina—an eight-year-old
boy who was saved only by the quick thinking of his cat, Fred, who
pushed the phone off the hook with his muzzle and dialed the
department of weights and measures. (It would, perhaps, have
been more logical for Fred to dial the fire department, but one
can hardly expect a cat to summon a fire engine which is fol-
lowed by a Dalmatian, can one?)

But I digress. The population explosion, I say, is upon us.
It is, of course, cause for concern but not for alarm, because I
feel sure that science will ultimately find an answer. After all,

 

has not science in recent years brought us such marvels as the
maser, the bevatron, and the Marlboro filter? Oh, what a saga
of science was the discovery of the Marlboro filter! Oh, what a
heart-rending epic of trial and error, of dedication and perse-
verance! And, in the end, what a triumph it was when the
Marlboro research team, after years of testing and discarding
one filter material after another—iron, nickel, tin, antimony,
obsidian, poundcake—finally emerged, tired but happy, from
their laboratory, carrying in their hands the perfect filter
cigarette! Indeed, what rejoicing there still is whenever we
light up a Marlboro which comes to us in soft pack and Flip-
Top Box in all fifty states and Cleveland!

Yes, science will ultimately solve the problems arising from
the population explosion, but meanwhile America’s colleges
are in dire straits. Where can we find classrooms and teachers
for today’s gigantic influx of students?

Well sir, some say the solution is to adopt the trimester sys-
tem. This system, already in use at many colleges, eliminates
summer vacations, has three semesters per annum instead of
two, and compresses a four-year-course into three years.

This is, of course, good, but is it good enough? Even under
the trimester system the student has occasional days off. More-
over, his nights are utterly wasted in sleeping. Is this the kind
of all-out attack that is indicated?

I say no. I say desperate situations call for desperate reme-
dies. I say that partial measures will not solve this crisis. I
say we must do no less than go to school every single day of
the year. But that is not all. I say we must go to school 24
hours of every day!

The benefits of such a program are, as you can see, obvious.
First of all, the classroom shortage will disappear because all
the dormitories can be converted into classrooms. Second, the
teacher shortage will disappear because all the night watchmen
can be put to work teaching solid state physics and Restoration
drama. And finally, overcrowding will disappear because every-
body will quit school.

Any further questions? @ 1963 Max Shulman

+ + *

Yes, one further question: the makers of Marlboro, who
sponsor this column, would like to know whether you have
tried a Mariboro lately. It’s the filter cigarette with a man’s
world of flavor. Settle back and enjoy one soon.

For Troubs

(Continued from page 1)

Chorus of Firemen

Adding to the theatrical ingen-
uity of this comic play will be the
use of a chorus of nine firemen, led
by Charles Bright. Commenting,
warning, and performing much the
same function as the chorus of a
Greek comedy, the firemen include
Bill Chaplin and Bob Fusell, seniors,
Steve Millard and Syd Parum, soph-
omores, and Bob Baker, Jom Cogar,
Jay Hight and Jim Luck, freshmen.
This choral device represents a trend
in modern drama to heighten enter-
tainment in unusual and unfamiliar
ways.

Also featured in The Firebugs will
be Lockhart Handley as the traitor-
ous Ph.D. and Lewis Davis as the
policeman. Reappearing on the Troub
stage this year will be two Lexing-
ton High School students, Betsy
Letcher and Kendall Jamison as
Anna and Mrs. Knechtling.

Volpe Makes Debut

Betsy Letcher and Tim Dols were
seen last year during the spring
one-act play festival, having lead
roles in The Apoollo of Bellac. Also
seen at tht time was Steve Colvin
who was the sole player in Samuel
Becketts Krapp’s Last Tape. Charles
Bright was seen most recently in
Mollere’s Tartuffe as was Kendall
Jamison. Joe Volpe will make his
debut on the Troubadour stage this
fall, although he has had consider-
able experience in summer drama
groups. In all, seven actors will
make their first appearance on the
Troub stage with The Firebugs.

Biederman and the  Firebugs
will be performed November 6-9
at the Troubadour Theatre. Season
tickets will be available at the box-
office throughout the first perfor-
mance.

 

NOTICE
The management of the National

Senses and Half-Senses

It was night and at the seashore and warm (for it
was the first month of summer). And he was there. He
sat there in the dark, on the beach, with just a pair of
shorts on. He was content there: that passive content-
ment that comes only when all the senses are satisfied
in just being—being there existing, enjoying. But
what was there to enjoy there? Not much. Only the
sound of the lapping surf in his ears, the feel of rough
particles of sand rubbing against his skin, the smell
of salt air stinging his nostrils, the taste of no-taste
inside his mouth (for he had been drinking), and the
sight of nothing in particular (for it was, as I said,
dark there, and even more dark because there was
no moon there). Maybe there was enjoyment or rather

Liberalized Cut Proposal
Nears Faculty Completion,
Dean Atwood Informs IFC

By HOWARD EPSTEIN
Staff Reporter

Dr. E. C. Atwood, Dean of Stu-
dents told the Interfraternity Council
last night that the cut proposal sent
to the faculty last spring is nearing
a stage of completion. It still is indefi-
nite as to when the proposal will go
before the faculty at large for con-
sideration.

In that the proposal has not been
released from committee at this time,
and considering that it may be altered
in faculty session after it is proposed,
it is thought best not to reveal any
of the features of the proposal at
this time.

Introduced Last May

The original proposition was intro-
duced last May by John Kirkley in
the form of a petition. After it re-
ceived signatures of 80 per cent of the
student body, Kirkley presented it
before a joint faculty committee which
appointed a subcommittee to draw
up and study the proposal.

The subcommittee has remained ac-
tive, and expects, according to Dr.
Atwood, to present its proposal and
findings to the entire faculty in about
a month.

Faculty Invitations

Also at the meeting, the annual
problem of faculty invitations to fra-
ternity houses on Parents Day was
discussed. It was pointed out by IFC
President Art Broaddus, that last year
many faculty members had to refuse
a great number of invitations. He
therefore suggested that each frater-
nity invite only a few faculty mem-
bers.

Immediately after the suggestion was
accepted, Dr. Atwood added that al-
ready one fraternity had issued in-
vitations to 90 members of the facul-
ty.

Following this discusion the council
chose Tuesday, October 29 as the date
for the Student-Faculty Banquet.

The final action taken by the council
was the acceptance of the conditions
set down by the faculty pertaining to
fraternity Christmas parties. It was
stipulated that only nine parties would
be allowed on each of the two week-
ends in December, and that these were
to be closed.

bat skills was proven in World
War II.”

The trip was apparently not all

days in one camp and spent the

Peter Sellers’ New Film,
‘Wrong Arm of the Law’,

Comes To Lyric This Week
(Continued from page 2)

If there isn’t, next Sunday a good
movie is coming fo rcertain. It is
one of eight for fourteen films that
Peter Sellers turns out each year,
and it is easily one of his best. “The
Wrong Arm of the Law” concerns a
gang of Sellers-led criminals who,
despite giving thorough considera-
tio nto each job, are always caught
in the act by the police. However,
the police simply take back the
stolen goods and never arrest the
gang.

Sellers and Jeffries ‘Excellent’

With this beginning you will be
led into one of the funniest films I
have seen for several years. Both
Sellers and Lionel Jeffries are ex-
cellent and they are aided by an
able supporting cast. Yet most credit
should go to the writers. Since,
however, they number seven I won’t
bother to praise them by name; I
will merely say their productive
effort is hilarious and they can cer-
tainly be charitable with one an-
other.

By W&L Coach

on the continent during his stay
Mrs. Lord went for the trip, and
according to the coach, kept a good
eye on him.

For me the highlights of the
trip was our tour of East Berlin,”
he indicated. “We had visas and
had no trouble passing the check
points. It is hard to explain the
difference between the two sec-
tions of Berlin; you really have to
go there. Everything in East Ber-
lin is run down. You can tell just
by the gait of the people that they
are down-trodden. There is no
sparkle in their eyes. West Berlin
was bustling.”

As to the success of the summer,
Coach Lord said he could not guess
exactly how much impact the clin-
ics or his report would have on
camp intramural systems. He did
feel, though, that changes for the
better would be made as a result.
He added that the tour was a great
professional opportunity for him.

“Even though the trip was fun
and both my wife and I enjoyed it,
we were both glad to get home. We
both were exhausted.” Anyone
who has had the good coach for
P.E. would find that last statement
a little hard to believe; he never
seem to tire. Enthused as_ ever,
Norman Lord is now back at W&L
expounding the virtue of the “Fear-
ome Four” to digruntled students.
