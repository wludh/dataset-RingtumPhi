Troubadours To Present
‘Firebug’ By Max Frisch

By C. C. FLIPPEN
The Firebugs by Max

Frisch, forthing presentation
of the Troubadour Theater,
is a drama which departs from
the usual attempts to depict
realism on the stage.

It stresses rather “open theatrical-
ity.”

“This and the fact that it is one
of the better recent plays is why
we have chosen to produce it this
year,” Dr. Cecil Jones, director of
the production, said.

“Open theatricality” is a stage
technique which emphasizes the
conventions of the theatre rather

 

Freshmen Receive 77 ‘U’s’
For First Grading Period

For a three-day period ending
yesterday, anxious freshmen visited
the offices of their respective ad-
visors to find out and discus the
results of four weeks work as
represented by the “S and U” re-
ports.

Unlike the mid-term grades, the
unsatisfactory reports are not sent
to the student’s home. They serve
only to show the unfortunate fresh-
man who receives notice cf unsatis-
factory work his hazardous schol-
astic situation.

The unsatisfactory reports this
October differ significantly from
those reports given in previous years
in that D grades no longer consti-
tute an unsatisfactory notice. Only
the grades of F and F-plus do the
professors send in as U’s.

One hundred and seven students
receive a total of one hundred and
forty-two unsatisfactory grades with
the following distribution: 77 stu-
dents with 1 unsatisfactory grade;
26 students with 2 unsatisfactory
grades; 3 students with 3 unsatis-
factory grades; and 1 dolt with four
unsatisfactory grades.

 

Leadership Society Names
9 To Steering Committee

The ODK-sponsored leadership
meeting which was held earlier this
month has announced a. steering
committee to begin formal organiza-
tion.

The new steering committee of
the body consists of Bill Noell, Don
Partington, Ken Lane, Kemp Morton,
Jim DeYoung, Travis Oliver, John
Moore, Fred Cooper, Barry Staniar,
and Rod Cockshutt in addition to its
president Jud Reis and vice-presi-
dent Bill Burke.

Jud Reis explained, “This steering
committe has been set up to guide
the recently formed Leadership So-
ciety. The Society is composed of
every president of every organiza-
tion on campus. It is hoped that the
Society and the steering committee

than attempting to picture things
realistically.

“It represents a growing interest
in viewpoint as opposed to the pho-
tographic type staging,” Dr. Jones
said.

This idea goes back many years.
Some critics realized long ago that
the cinema could reproduce realism
far better than the stage. Why not
leave realism to the motion picture
and let the theatre concentrate on
what it could do best?

Today there is a growing interest
in this game. The Theatre of the
Absurd represents one phase. Ed-
ward Albee also attempts it to a
degree.

“There is another group in Ger-
man yand Switzerland which is at-
tempting to follow the similar style
of Bertolt Brecht’s epic theatre. Of
this group Frisch is the best,” Dr.
Jones said.

There are a number of techniques
in The Firebugs which illustrate this
style.

For one there is the use of a
chorus of firemen which represents
a particular point of view.

“The character drawing, which is
akin to Ionesco’s in his full length
dramas, also represents this style.
Here we get individualized charac-
ters—people in whom we can be-
lieve, but who nevertheless repre-
sent a wider range of people,” Jones
said.

There is also the use of a cimul-
taneous setting. The attic and liv-
in room settings exist side by side.

Night and day is indicated by
lowering a crescent moon in and
out.

There are occasionally elements on
stage which are not in a particlar
secent.

“Out of this you get ashow which
is a type of fantasy— a parable
play as Brecht called it,’ Da. Jones
said.

“The play involves slapstick, but
always in sight is its satiric pur-
pose—correcting what Frisch thinks
is a major problem.”

The Firebugs is also an allegorical
type. Biedermann and his wife rep-
resent moral cowardice—the apathy
to evil of the upper middle class.

The two firebugs are variant forms
of evil. One is brutal, the other
insidious. The Ph.D. is the intellect
who feels all problems are to be
studied abstractly.

Authority is represented by the
police who are to a degree helpless
to oppose it until it happens. “Even-
tually it happens on such a big scale
that they can’t handle it,” Dr. Jones
said.

Many have seen in the play a
warning against the modern danger
of Communism. The Trougs, how-
ever, are producing it without com-
ment on any particular situation,
but rather as a basic viewpoint about
the forces of evil and destruction.

The Firebugs was written in 1958
and produced last season off- Broad-
way.

 

Glee Club

Performs Sat.
BY Gene Hatfield

Something new will have
been added when the W&L
Glee Club, under the direc-
tion of Mr. Robert Stewart,
presents its first concert of

the season tomorrow night at
8:30 in Doremus Gymnasium.

Dorcas Campbell, Miss Virginia
of 1963, will join the glee club in
entertaining what is hoped to be a
capacity crowd of parents, students,
faculty and townspeople.

Miss Campbell will join baritone
John Baker in singing the music
from the Bradway hit, West Side
Story. Such popular numbers as
“Maria” and “Tonight” will be in-
cluded in this section of the pro-
gram.

Among Miss Campbell’s previous
performances are appearances on
the nationally televised Voice of
Firestone and with the Chicago
symphony. She is a native of Rock-
bridge County and is said to bear a
striking resemblance to Mrs. John
F. Kennedy

The program for the concert is
widely varied ranging from folk
songs to a selection from the Gloria
Mass in Latin by Vivaldi. Baritone
Bill Supon will sing the lead on
the Vivaldo selection.

Bass Phil Booth will solo on “Ten
Thousand Miles Away,” a sea shanty.
Baker will also see service as the
soloist on “This Ol’ Hammer,” a
negro work song about the legen-
dary John Henry. Guitarist Frank
Wakefield will accompany Baker on
this number.

Another special feature of the pro-
gram will be the performance of a
barber shop quartet consisting of
Randy Lee, Randy Williams, Jon
Neegaard and Scott Lavey. The
group will sing a medley of num-
bers from the turn of the century.

Selections by Bach and Handel as
well as the old favorites will be in-
cluded in the two hour program.
It is hoped there will be a favorite
for everyone in a performance of
such widely varied nature.

Students Ask For Better Entertainment

By SYD LEWIS
Executive Editor
In recent weeks much con-
troversy has arisen over the
Dance Board and Washington
and Lee’s big party weekends.
To try to bring student opinion

into the open, the Ring-tum

Phi has taken a sample survey of

students, trying to include sample

opinions from all fraternities, all

classes, and non-fraternity men.
Openings

The most prevelent question at the
moment is the quality of last week’s
entertainment. Of the people polled,
only 15 per cent thought the at-
tractions in the aggregate were
good, while 56 per cent thought the
entertainment was fair. Twenty-two
per cent of the participants thought
the dance and concert were poor.
(The percentages will not always
add up to 100 per cent because in
some cases students had no opin-
ions).

Many students seemed to dislike
the formal attire at the dance;
however, 41.5 per cent attended. In
an effort to ascertain what circum-
stances would induce a_ larger
crowd, the students who did not
attend were asked: 1) if they would
have attended an informal dance

 

and 2) if they attended a for-
mal dance if drinks of an alcoholic
nature were served. Some 62.5 per
cent said they wiuld attend an in-
formal dance and an overwhelming
majority of 80.5 per cent said they
would attend a formal dance if
drinks were served.

Future Plans

During the sale of Dance Plans
the Dance Board made several an-
nouncements of tentative entertain-
ment for the rest of the year. Only
31.7 per cent of those polled thought
that the plans were good while 29.2
per cent thought future engage-
ments were bad and 34.1 per cent
thought that tentative entertainment
was merely fair. These statistics
seem to confirm the feeling that
there isn’t the enthusiasm for the
performers which should be present.
To determine who students did want,
those polled were asked who they
would like to see most at a concert
or dance. Ray Charles was the fore-
runner, followed by Peter Paul and
Mary, and James Brown. Then there
were several such others as Al Hurt,
Joan Baez, Barbara Streisand, Dave
Brubeck, who received a _ stronge
vote. As to the type of performers
wanted, 87.5 per cent said varied
entertainment was best while 7.3
per cent liked only rock and roll
and 5 per cent only folk music.

 

Finally, all those questioned were
asked how they thought the dance
board could be improved. Answers
were varied with most students
saying the Dance Board was doing
the best it could( though one pollee
thought the Dance Board ought to
be disbanded.) More definite con-
tracts, the signing of contracts be-
fore the school year, entertainment
other than singers, and less dances
were some of the constructive sug-
gestions offered. Although most
students expressed praise for ob-
taining Ray Charles, some thought
that $5,000 was too much to offer
everyone.

Although there were no uniform
suggestions submitted by the stu-
dents it seemed that everyone
thought that something must be done
to improve the party weekends. As
far as who to get there were varied
opinions; however, on one subject,
the dances, nearly everyone felt they
were inadequate. Of those who said
they attended, 40 per cent mentioned
that they remained less than an hour.
This probably indicates that the first
step to gain student enthusiasm for
school sponsored affairs would be
an improvement in the quality of
dances—possibly by making them
informal or by serving drinks at
dances. A possibility might be to
combine the traditional cocktail
party with the dance.

 

EC Appoints

Commutteemen

By SHANNON JUNG
Friday News Editor

The Executive Committee an-
nounced the appointment of four
new student body committeemen,
including three freshmen, and one
law school students.

This represents the first time
freshmen have been appointed to the
Cold Check and Student Library
Committees It is only the second
year that a freshman has been in-
cluded on the Assimilation Commit-
tee.

Bill Hartman, Sig Ep from Hono-
lulu, Hawaii, was appointed to be
the first freshman member of the
Cold Check Committee. Hartman
has also been selected to serve in
the Dance Board Advisory Com-
mittee. He was treasurer of his sen-
ior class and played varsity foot-
ball and track.

John Graham, a Delt pledge from
Richmond, Virginia, has been select-
ed to be the first freshman mernber
of the Student Library Committee.
Graham, who was vice-president of
Douglas Freeman High School, is
the holder of a Baker Scholarship
and plays freshman football.

Bryant Kendrick, Phi Delt from
Greenville South Carolina, has been
selected freshman representative to
the Assimilation Committee. Ken-
drick served as President of his
high school, captain of his high
schoo] track and football teams, and
was a member of the National
Honor Society. He ran for the office
of freshman EC, losing by a small
margin. He has also been elected
one of the tri-captains of the fresh-
man football team.

Ray Vizethannn, freshman law
student from Richwood, New Jersey,
has been appointed to the Assimila-
tion Committee. He is president of
his freshman law class.

The Executive Committee stressed
that the new freshman committee
appointments were made to broad-
en the scope of student representa-
tion on the various committees.

Debaters To Argue

Jefferson’s Theories

The applicability of Thomas Jef-
ferson’s ideas to modern America
will be argued by Washington and
Lee’s championship debate team in
Lee Chapel at 8 tonight.

The topic “Resolved: That Thomas
Jefferson would be tried for trea-
son today” will be debated in an
exhibition which will mark the last
time Bill Noell and Al Eckes will
oppose eath other in a match.

The debate will be presented ia
the British style, which allows the
participants to deride each other and
introduce an element of humor into
the argument. The question to be
debated is whether Jefferson's ideas
are still valid in the light of 20th
century politics, culture, philoso-
phy, economies, and literature.

In the debate tonight there will
be an attempt to hold Jefferson lit-
erally to his statements, according
to one of the four debaters. In-
stead, the object will be to examine
the framework to which he pinned
his ideas.

Debating the affirmative will be
Mike Hayslip and Bill Noe!l, and
opposing them will be Jay Clark
and Al Eckes. Noell and Eckes
composed the W&L team which ad-
vaneed to the national champion-
ship tournament last year. Clark,
a member of one of Washington
and Lee’s former Virginia champion
teams, is captain of the debate
team this year. Hayslip is a sopho-
more who won the award as W&L’s
Outstanding Freshman debater Jast
year.

Last year the same team, with
the exception of Hayslip, staged an
exhibition debate for Parents’
Weekend on the subject, “Resolvea:
That the South should have won
the Civil War.” This subject was
also handled in a humorous manner.
The British debating style employed
in these exhibitions is a free-wheel-
ing, non-classical exchange in which
the debaters must depend heavily
on eloquence, rather than carefully
constructed arguments.

 

Notices

All freshmen affiliated with a fra-
ternity are reminded that they are
to eat at their fraternity houses to-
night. All non-fraternity freshmen
will eat in the private dining room
in Evans Dining Hall.

Virginia Leading State
In ’63 Enrollment Totals

A total of 1,265 students from 42
states, the District of Columbia and
eight foreign countries are enrolled
at Washington and Lee University
this fall.

This year’s official enrollment is
25 higher than the 1962 total of
1,231, according to E. H. Howard,
University Registrar.

The University registered 1,186
students in September of 1961.

Virginia again leads the states in
representation with 272 students.
Maryland has the second highest en-
rollment with 90 and New Jersey
and New York each have 71. For-
eign countries represented in this
year’s student body include Argen-
tina , Denmark, Germany, _§Italy,
Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sweden and
the Virgin Islands.

Washington and Lee’s current
freshman class numbers 340 as com-
pared with last year’s 334. This fall,
there are 282 sophomores, 232 jun-
iors and 240 seniors.

In the School of Law, Dean
Charles P. Light reports an en-
rollment of 156. The Law School
total includes 62 new men, 51 sec-
ond year students and 42 seniors.
There were 142 law students last
year.

Washington and Lee’s enrollment
climbed above 1,200 in the late 1940’s
with an influx of World War II vet-
erans. During the 1950’s, the Uni-
versity’s enrollment hovered around
the 1,100 mark.

*and Lee life as well as to entertain

them.

Weekend activities commence with
the registration of parents this morn-
ing, 10 to 12 am., in Washington
Hall, and will end Saturday evening
with performances by the W&L
Glee Club, John Graham Brass
Choir, and Miss Dorcas Campbell in
Doremus Gymnasium.

Following registration this morn-
ing, parents met with advisors and
professors at pre-arranged hours
of appointment. The appointments
were from 2 to 4:30 p.m., and will
continue tomorrow morning from 9
to 11.

The annual meeting of the Parents’
Advisory Council was held this af-
ternoon in the Student Union Build-
ing.

Guided tours of Lee Chapel began
at 3:30 this afternoon and included
the new basement museum. At the
same time, the University’s science
facilities were open to the inspec-
tion of parents and students. The
Lee Chapel tours ended at 4:30, but
the Chapel will remain open during
its normal hours tomorrow, and
special hours of 9:30 to 11 a.m. on
Sunday.

While the afternoon campus tours
were in progress, the freshmen foot-
ball team played Bridgewater Col-
lege’s team on Wilson Field.

This evening several rounds of
unique entertainment will be pro-
vided for the parents. From 8 until
9 p.m. there will be faculty discus-
sions on “The Proposed Tax Cut:
Its effect on the Economy,” “Why
Johnny Can’t write,” and “The Com-
puter in Action: Master or Slave?”
At the same time in Lee Chapel
a crack team of student debaters
will argue the question, “Resolved:
That Thomas Jefferson Would Be
Tried for Treason Today.”

Following the debate and discus-
sions ending at 9 p.m., President and
Mrs. Fred C. Cole will host a re-
ception for parents and students in
Evans Dining Hall.

The major attraction for Satur-
day morning is “Reports to Parents”
at 11 am., although there will be
further tours earlier in the morn-
ing. The reports consist of speeches
from the president of the student
body, the deans of all schools and
the dean of students, the director
of admissions, and the president of
the University.

Following the reports the parents
will be served a buffet luncheon in
Evans Dining Hall from 12 to 1:45
p.m.

Ending the activities of Friday and
Saturday will be the Glee Club
Concert at 8:30 p.m. in the gym.

 

 

UCA To Be Sponsor Sieg Reception

Honoring New

By REN MANNING

The University Christian Associa-
tion will sponsor an informal re-
ception for W&L’s three foreign
students Monday night from 7:30
to 8:30 in duPont Auditorium.

The three students, Giancarlo
Marchetti, from Rome Italy; Preben
Berthelsen from Aalborg, Denmark;
and Anders Henricsson from Stock-
holm Sweden; will each speak for
a few minutes chiefly to introduce
themselves and their countries. Re-
freshments and informal conver-
sation will follow their addresses.

“We hope to provide an oppor-
tunity for students and faculty to
meet and talk with our foreign
students,” said Rod Cockshutt, UCA
president.

This year the students from
abroad are trying out a new type
of housing arrangement. In_ the
past, foreign students have lived
in the University dormitory and
eaten their meals in the fraternity
houses on a two week rotating
basis. This year they are living and
eating in the same house for the
entire year: Giancarlo Marchetti
in the Kappa Sigma house, Preben
Berthelsen in the Phi Epsilon Pi
house, and Anders Henriesson in
the Delta Upsilon house.

Last year the students themselves,
from Sweden, Norway and Italy

Foreign Students

were dissatisfied with the system of
rotating. They asserted that they
did not seem a part of one group.
“Every time we began to fit in at
home and know some of the broth-
ers, we had to move to another
house,” they stated. The Interfrater-
nity Council looked into this prob-
lem and came up with the new sys-
tem which apparently has worked
very well so far. The students seem
very pleased with it.

The University supplies the tui-
tion and the fees to two of the stu-
dents and the other receives the
Isador Scott scholarship. They came
to the University through the In-
stitute of International Education
in New York to whom they submit
applications. The IE chooses a list
of students who will come to the
States to study and then it is up
to the individual colleges to ask
for information on each of the stu-
dents for consideration. The colleges
put in a bid of their first choices
and the number they want.

Upon knowing who the student
will be in the Spring, the fraternities
are told about the system and are
given an opportunity to decide
whether or they want a student in
their house in the next year. The
| Interfraternity Council then has the
| task of determining exactly where
| the students will stay.

Period Of Adjustment

On behalf of the University, we welcome the more than
one thousand moms and dads who will visit us this weekend.

We would also like to issue our best wishes to the fresh-
men—this is your first Parents’ Weekend and you’d better not
spoil the act. If you get stagefright easily, just memorize the
following briefing:

 

Yes, the food is abominable and does not compare at all |

with the delicacies Mom used to serve; yes, you are very home-
sick, things just haven’t been normal since you left; no you
haven’t lost your toothbrush, you use it daily; yes you are
studying ten hours a day just like Dad advised in his last letter.

Firsthand, you may not see any reason for the above fabri-
cation; it only makes sense when you realize that your parents |

are going through a very difficult period of adjustment without

you, and all they ask of you this weekend is the added assurance |

they are still needed.

Revision Needed

Immediate revision is needed in the Federal law provid-
ing for the removal of a prisoner from the State courts to
Federal jurisdiction. Under existing laws, if a person’s Con-
stitutional rights are violated during arrest, he is only eligible
for removal to a national court if he can convince the Federal
District Court to grant Federal authority over the case. This
means that in the South where a judge might be somewhat
apathetic to the Federal Government, a defendant might not
always be judged on the merits of his case and therefore left at
the mercy of the State courts.

Before Congress now is a bill which will alleviate this situa-
tion. It provides that a prisoner trying to be moved to a Federal
Court can appeal the decision of the District Courts to the
Circuit Courts and even to the Supreme Court. This, of course,
permits one who is not satisfied with the District Court’s de-
cision to appeal to higher courts. The passage of this measure
seems to be good common sense. In almost all other cases
before the courts a defendant is allowed to appeal. Why then
should one who is charging the violation of his constitutional
rights not be given this opportunity?

In conclusion, the enactment of this law might provide
civil rights demonstrators who are under the opinion they have
been arrested in violation of their constitutional rights a better
chance to be tried in Federal courts and this measure will strike
another blow at the South’s fight against civil rights.

star in Rampage, the touching saga

 

By BOB POTTS
Friday Columnist

Out of 613 cases submitted to the
Supreme Court this summer, the
nine justices must decide to rule on
such topics as
obscenity, legisla-
tive apportion-
ment, application
of the fifth
amendment, and
most important of
all, discrimination.

There are five
cases from Mary-
land, South Caro-
lina, and Florida
that deal with
civil rights dem-
onstrators who were arrested at
lunch counters, restaurants, etc. on
the basis of trespass laws.

What the court must decide is
if it is unconstitutional for state or
local governments to enforce ra-
cial discrimination in privately
owned public accommodations by
using police force.

The ramifications of future Su-
preme Court action is obvious in re-
lation to immediate civil rights leg-
islation, but is more significant in
other ways.

Potts Views Public Will Giving
US Constitution ‘Real Meaning’

No Easy Solution

The Constitution offers no easy
solution to such a problem and
those who all but recite articles
with each bead of their political
rosary will declare that the “pub-
lice accommodations” clause of the
Kennedy civil rights bill is uncon-
stitutional.

Indulging in a lapse from legal-
ity, Americans might for a mom-
ent consider the tone of the Con-
stitution. While it was written as a
series of compromises between
various factions of American so-
ciety, the Constitution serves today
as a concrete basis from which to

model our political actions. Yet
the will of the public is what
finally gives the Constitution any
real meaning.

Historical Case

There is a historical case in point
which illustrates this thought. God
gave to the Israelites a series of
codes to live by and Moses wrote
these on stone. In turn, God com-
manded the Israelies to build an
ark, the Ark of the Covenant and
place within it these laws or Torah.
Later, the Philistines captured the
Ark and thus caused one Israelite to
say, “The glory is departed from

October 19, 1963
Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

A reply to the outlandish article,
“Communism, Conservatism Base

lished last Friday is in order.

As a rejoinder I would like to lift
a quote, this being from one of the
leading American Conservatives:

“Conservatism is not an economic
theory, though it has economic im-
plications. The shoe is precisely on

THE EDITOR

the other foot: it is Socialism (Col-
lectivists, Communists, Liberals, et
al.) that subordinates all other con-
siderations to man’s material well-
being. It is Conservatism that puts
material things in their proper
place that has a structured view of
the human being and of human so-
ciety, in which economies plays only
a subsidiary role.

Local Flicks Rated

Some excellent movies are pend-
ing locally. The Lyric presents on
Sunday Allen Stillitoe’s The Lone-
liness of the Long Distance Runner,
and, later Rashamon and Genet’s
The Balcony. The State will offer
The Haunting, high-cut Hollywood
horror-in-the-hay, Walt Disney’s
memorable adaptation of Jules
Verne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea, and in three weeks’s
time, West Side Story.

Suggestions for long-range flick
teams: Washington, Philadelphia, and
New York offer (among other en-
ticements) theaters equipped for
Cinerama, and two entertaining ex-
amples of that medium at its best
should be showing in each city
throughout the winter: How the
West Was Won and It’s a Mad, Mad,
Mad World. The first adds a new di-
mension to our understanding of In-
dian attacks, the second is America’s
tongue-in-wallet answer to Mondo
Cane. Both will eventually appear
in standard Panavision. For the less
adventurous, Lawrence of Arabia
opened in Roanoke on October 24th,
and it is worth the trip.

 

Notice

Mr. James Whitehead, Director
of University Relations, requests

After Thirty-Seven Years

 

Dean Gilliam Continues To Serve His University

1926 as a member of the English
faculty. Designated Dean Emeritus
by the University’s Board of Trus-
tees, Dean Gilliam has not retired
in the usual sense of the word. He

Editor’s Note: The following ar-
ticle is taken in part from the sum-
mer issue of the Alumni Magazine.
Since most students, and the fresh-
men in particular, have no oppor-

tunity to read the Alumni publi-
cation, the Ring-tum Phi reprints
this story on the man who is a sym-
bol of Washington and Lee to count-
less students and many more gradu-
ates, Dean Frank J. Gilliam, Dean
Gilliam stepped down from his po-
sition as Dean of Admissions at the
end of last year.

When Dean of Admissions Frank
J. Gilliam vacated his office this
summer he moved two well-worn
leather chairs with him as reminders
of his work with generations of
Washington and Lee students.

Since 1931, nearly every Wash-
ington and Lee man has had at

least two chances to sit in one of}

those chairs. If an applicant to the
University did not visit with Dean
Gilliam in his role as Dean of Ad-
missions, then he probably got to see
him later—for one reason or an-
other—as Dean of Students.

Although Frank J. Gilliam only
officially “wore two hats” as Dean
of Students and Director of Admis-
sions from 1951 to 1962, he has been
at both jobs much longer. He be-
came Washington and Lee’s first
Dean of Students in 1931, and, as
admissions work grew in scope and
complexity, he assumed responsibili-
ty for both jobs. In 1962, at his own
request, he was relieved of his re-
sponsibilities as Dean of Students
that he might devote full attention to
the admissions program.

His retirement this summer ac~-
tually marked the close of 37 years
as a member of Washington and
Lee’s administration and faculty—
he first came to the University in

 

will continue to serve as a consult- ||

ant to the admissions office and as

a special advisor to President Fred | |

C. Cole.

His second floor Washington Hall ;

office has been relocated on the first | 7 i

floor. The 68-year-old Dean plans
to stay busy in his new role, but
the pressure of his former jobs he
leave behind.

Just as Dean Gilliam’s warm
friendship has marked the lives of
thousands of his students, his fore-

sight, energy, and capacity to get |

things done have led to achievements
that have made distinctive marks
of the University. He was influen-
tial in the planning that resulted
in the opening of Letitia Pate Evans

Dining Hall four years ago, and in j

the expansion of the University’s
dormitory facilities to accommodate
upperelassmen, law students, and a
slight inerease in the size of the
freshman class.

He established Washington and
Lee’s pattern of freshman living,
whereby new students are required
to reside in the dormitories under
the guidance of carefully selected
counselors. He helped promote the
formation of the University Publi-
cations Board. He was instrumental
in the development of the frater-
nity housemother system.

One of his proudest achievements
is the annual Freshman Camp, which
this September conducted its 32nd
three-day orientation and recreation
program at Natural Bridge for new
students. Dean Gilliam deserves the
title of “founding father” of the
camp, and served as its director until

1956. He still finds time each Sep-
tember to pay a visit to the camp-
site for at least one day.

Dean Gilliam was also instrumen-
tal in setting up the University’s
important faculty adviser program,
in which each new student comes
under the direct personal influence
of an experienced professor who
assists the young man in solving
problems both academic and per-
sonal. Dean Gilliam continually
sought ways to improve upon the
system, and worked diligently to
| match freshmen with the best pos-

 

 

 

W. S. S. Wilson’s portrait of Dean Gilliam

sible faculty adviser, as suggested by
the student’s application informa-
tion and admission scores.

Much of Dean Gilliam’s work in-
volved him in fraternity relations.
He has served as chairman of the
faculty committee on fraternities,
and he has steadfastly labored to
strengthen the influence of the stu-
dent Interfraternity Council.

While the great majority of
Washington and Lee men know Dean
Gilliam as Dean of Students, per-
haps most educational associates
outside the University admire him

for his knowledge and experience
in the admissions field.

Washington and Lee’s admissions
program today is essentially Dean
Gilliam’s admissions program. Other
colleges and universities have used
his work as a model and profited
by his example. He is an enthusias-
tic supporter of the work of the)
College Entrance Examination Board,
of whose trustees President Cole is
now chairman. Largely through
Dean Gilliam’s urging, Washington |
and Lee became in 1950 the first |
men’s college in the South to re-
quire the Scholastic Aptitude Test}

 

 

\of the CEEB for all applications. |

Three years ago, again under Dean |
Gilliam’s leadership, Washington |
and Lee became the first men’s col-
lege in the South to require three |
CEEB achievement tests of each|
candidate for admission. |

Dean Gilliam’s stature as an ad-|
missions authority and his interest |
in the CEEB led to his appoint- |
ment in 1952 as the first represen-
tative of a Southern college to serve
on the CEEB’s executive commit-
tee, a post he held for three years.

In March, 1962, Dean Gilliam
was stricken with a heart attack at
the busiest time of the year for a
college admissions man. Dean Gil-
liam’s close associate of ten years,

Associate Dean of Admissions
James D. Farrar, took over effi-
cently, and completed the selec-

tion of the 1962 entering class in
a manner that reflected the inval-
uable experience to be gainea in
working with a person like Dean
Gilliam.

Dean Gilliam’s recovery was rap-
id and complete, and he returned to
his work in September, a year ago.
But he made no secret of his hope
to relinquish soon the heavy respon-

 

 

sibilities. As the end of the aca-
demic year 1962-63 approached, a
number of events suggested the
awareness of the student body and
alumni that the University would
be losing one of its outstanding
figures.

The Executive Committee set up

the “Gilliam Award” to recognize
meritorious contributions to the
University by a senior. Members

of the Board of Trustees arranged
for a portrait of Dean Gilliam to be
to the

presented University, and
the painting was hung in Evans
Dining Hall. The Ring-tum Phi

honored Dean Gilliam in editorial
praise and the 1963 Calyx was dedi-
cated to him with the words “Dean
Gilliam’s contribution to the prog-
ress of Washington and Lee trans-
cends all verbal tribute....” Presi-
dent Cole singled him out for praise
in the 1963 graduation remarks, and
Dean Gilliam was accorded 4 stand-
ing ovation.

Like all dynamic men in an aca-
demic setting, he helped build his
own legend that future Washington
and Lee men will share. Generations
of students remember his big,
broad-rimmed slouch hats, and his
distinctive walk. His phenomenal
ability to remember names is an ex-
ample of the personal interest in
his students that has always charac-
terized Dean Gilliam.

In his traditional address to the
entering class each fall Dean Gil-
liam was able to create a feeling of
the spirit of Washington and Lee as
no other speaker could. Although
he no longer gives a speech to each
freshman class, that spirit is some-
thing he still creates for students and
alumni alike; for Washington and
Lee spirit has found expression in
Dean Gilliam’s life.

Booters Play On Wilson Field
This Saturday For W&L Parents

By TIM HENRY

This Saturday, Wilson Field will
be the scene of a soccer game in-
stead of the usual Football contest.
Coach Lyles’ soecermen take on
King College in its sixth game of
the season. Lyles wants very much
for soccer to gain popularity in this
section of the country, and this
could serve a wonderful opportuni-
ty for publicity through the parents
who will be there this weekend.
Dr. Cole is expected to be present
to witness the action. Programs will
be provided for the uninformed. If
you have never seen a soccer game,
come and watch for a while, if only

out of curiosity. Rated internation-
ally, soecer is the world’s most
spectacular sport, so there has to
be something to the game.

About the Game

Last year the Generals tied King
4-4 at Bristol, Tenn., in a game
played in a continuous downpour
which turned the field into a quag-
mire. Forty-five to fifty degree
weather made the game even more
uncomfortable. King beat VPI 3-0,
while W&L defeated the Tech team
5-0, so the game should be close
with W&L bearing a slight advant-
age. With a heavy schedule coming
the soccermen will be anxious to get
another victory under their feet
before playing U.Va., and Roanoke.
With six games to play there is still
time to amass an excellent record.

According to the latest standings,
W&L is second in the state behind
U.Va., with Lynchburg in third
place. In spite of a mere 3-2 record,
the Generals have outscored their
opponents 15-6, a tribute to the
team’s excellent defense, as well as
to the offense.

No one man can be singled out
of the defense as the best, it works
as a team. As typical of the de-

as to just who is the number one
one small college team in the coun-
try. David Shufflebarger seems to
accept unconditionally “the top na-
tional sports magazine’s” opinion
that Wittenberg leads the pack.
While not trying to take anything
away from Wittenberg, we’d like to
nominate several other teams which
we feel are better—namely, Dela-
ware, Northern Illinois, and Florida
A&M. Delaware has rolled to a 46
point per game average, highest in
the nation, over a rougher sched-
ule than Wittenberg. Florida A&M,
year in and year out, leads the small
colleges in players drafted by the
pros. George Bork, Northern IIli-
nois’ quarterback, has many days
like last Saturday—38 out of 53 for
445 yards to give Northern Illinois
its number one ranking in the UPI

FOOTBALL TEAM TO MEET H.5. TIGERS

Injuries Plaguing Generals

By BILLY CANNON

Friday Sports Writer
W&L still licking their wounds
from last week’s 31-0 defeat travel
to Hampden-Sydney tomorrow to
clash with the always tough Tigers.

Coach Lee McLaughlin will be
without the services of starters Syd
Butler and Bill Angel. Also missing
from the squad will be quarterback
Brice Gamber and sophomore half-
back Harry’ Brookby. Several
others, including Henry Sackett,
will play still feeling the pains of
last week’s contest. Butler and
Angel both suffered leg injuries.
Gamber separated his shoulder and
Brookby hurt his back.

Joe Miller will replace Angel go-
ing both ways for the Generals at
guard. Either Dan Manson or John
Anthony will spell Butler.

“We can’t take Hampden-Sydney
too lightly. They’ve won three of five

this season and have a fine balanced

team,” commented Coach Mac, who
also said, “our line-up may contain
a few shake-ups.”

McLaughlin, not at all pleased
with the locals performance against
Susquehanna, pointed out the Gen-
erals will have to stop Trav Ty-
singer and Whitey Lipscomb if W&L
is going to win. Tysinger, a big half-
back who came close to dawning
the Blue and White of Washington
and Lee, runs well and is a con-
stant threat throwing a lefthanded
pass from his halfback post. Lips-
comb, a seasoned veteran, “passes
and handles the club very well.”

“Look for a close game,” continued
McLaughlin. “In my seven years
here we have split the six previous
games. We have been fortunate in
winning the last three, but it’s
interesting to note that none of

 

John Madison, Angel Out

the victories were by more than one
touchdown.”

The Tigers ran up 25 first downs
last week, completely dominating
the game statistic-wise, but fell vic-
tim to Western Maryland, 15-12.
They have also played CAC foe
Sewanee losing 49-0 early in the
season.

“I hope we'll be ready to go.
Syd (Butler) will hurt us on de-
fense, but I look for the boys to
bounce back after last week.”

 

X-Country To Meet C.U.

The W&L cross-country team
meets Catholic University tomorrow
afternoon. The Generals will be
seeking their fourth victory in five
starts.

A look at past performances
seemingly gives Coach Miller’s run-
ners an advantage. Catholic Uni-
versity has lost to Bridgewater, a
team which W&L defeated handily.
The Generals also have the advan-
tage of running on their home course.

However, four of the top five
W&L runners have minor injuries

Letter To The Editor

(Continued from page 2)

Conservatives and the Liberals of
today is that Conservatives take ac-
count of the whole man, while
Liberals tend to look only at the ma-|
terial side of man’s nature. The Con-
servative believes that man is, in|
part, an economic, an animal crea-
ture; but that he is also a spiritual |
creature with spiritual needs and|
spiritual desires. What is more, these |
needs and desires reflect the superior |
side of man’s nature, and thus take |
precedence over his economic wants. |
Conservatism, therefore, looks upon |
the enhancement of man’s spiritual |
nature as the primary concern of |
political philosophy. Liberals, on the
other hand—in the name of a con-
cern for ‘human beings’—regard the
satisfaction of economic wants as
the dominant mission of society.”

science of a Conservative, page 10.)

Letters To The Editor ...

 

 

Dear Mr. Brockenbrough:

You must be having “second
thoughts” yourself about the un-
reasoned and_ exceedingly loose

labels you enjoy sticking onto oth-
ers. I refer, of course, to myself—
the “self-styled prophet” who is
“running down school spirit” in
what you apparently consider an
evil attempt to destroy the football
team or the school’s spirit or both.

In the first place, in a purely con-
notative sense, the term “young
prophet” is incorrect in that my let-
ter of last week prophesyed nothing
but rather suggested that we play
better teams.

In the second place, I would like
to point out that someone who is so
pretentious as to publish a rather
personal column (even if it is an-
ymous) should understand what he
is talking about before he sticks
his neck out. To accuse me of try-
ing to run down school spirit dem-
onstrates that you couldn’t have
given last week’s letter more than
a cursory glance before writing your
column. I realize that unlike most of
the “young” (to use your expres-
sion) students here, you are proba-

bly very busy with weighty matters.
but if you will re-read the letter,
you might notice that I only offered
constructive criticism as to how
school spirit might be improved.

Next, you assume that school spirit
is beginning to be generated. If it
isn’t too great a strain on your
already-ponderous column, prove
it . . . in print. On what basis can
you flatly state that “a bit of it
(school spirit) is being generated”?
Is your evidence for this “genera-
tion” based on the sorry perfor-
mance of the spectators at Home-
coming, and if this is the case, do
you consider incoherent mumbling
and stoney silence indicative of en-
thusiasm?

In conclusion, Mr. Brockenbrough,
I do not object to your disagreeing
with me about our playing generally
poor teams—many do. I do, however,
strongly object to the cavalierly,
assinine, patronizing, and arrogant
manner in which you _ registered
your objection.
