‘Dean G. Acheson, Former Secretary Of State,

Four Others, To Assist Planning Of ‘Contact’

Dean G. Acheson, Secretary |
of State from 1949 to 1953,
leads a list of five national ad-
visors who will help coordinate
the projected weekend confer-

ence scheduled for Spring,
1965, named Contact. Acheson’s role
as an advisor to Contact, and the
agreement of four other men to
serve in a similar capacity, was an-
nounced today by Blaine Brownell,
Chairman of the 1965 Contact, and
Henry Quekemeyer, Assistant Chair-
man,

In addition to Acheson, the ad-
visors are Col. Francis P. Miller,
Philander P. Claxton, Jr., Dr. Mar-
shall Fishwick, and Dr. James W.
Silver. They will lend their pres-
tige and their advice and encourage-
ment to the program. Their services
will be rendered on behalf of a more
developed intellectural lecture and

Dean Acheson ons one of the coun-
try’s foremost experts on foreign
policy and is generally regarded as
one of the few outstanding states-
men this country has produced in
the twentieth century. Born in Mid- |
dletown, Connecticut in 1893, Ache- |
son attended Yale University and
the Harvard Law School and then)

 

entered upon a distinguished career | -

in the law and in government serv- |
ice that has led universities on both |
sides of the Atlantic to confer upon
him their honorary degrees and na-
tions of the free world to bestow
their highest decorations.

Acheson continues in both spheres
through the private practice of law
in Washington and as head of the
advisory group of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. His publica-
tions include A Citizen Looks At
Congress; A Democrat Looks at His
Party; Sketches from Life of Men I
Have Known; numerous articles for
Foreign Affairs magazine; and he is
currently working on another book.

Interview With Acheson

Brownell and Phil Claxton, Special
Assistant for Contact, had an hour-
long interview with Acheson
last week, and they will see him
again in two weeks. According to
Brownell, “Mr. Acheson gave us
some truly significant advice about
the substance and organization of
Contact, and was very interested in
its suecess. He will do all he can to
help us with the program, and we
will present him with details of its

 

progress from time to time. We are
truly fortunate to have such a man
to help us.”

The Distortion

By JO TARTT

This is the first and great commandment,
thou shalt not lie.

And the second is like unto it,
thou shalt not cheat.

And still there is another,
thou shalt not steal.

Now this is the law,
And it is honorable that a man keep the law,
And any man who breaks the law

is a man who lives without honor.

For here,

beneath the eyes of Ole George

and above the honorable bones of Robert E.,
What is law is no longer law,

but has been made honor.
And that which is honor

is now ripped from its rightful place:

the secret domain of each man’s heart,
And is written and instructed and enforced.
And thus destroyed.

dipity Singers’

Group Signed
For Tuesday
Night Concert

The Serendipity Singers, a
group just catapulted to na-
tional fame by their first hit
“Don’t Let the Rain Come
Down,” will perform at Final
Concert Tuesday, June 2, it
was announced today by Ed Croft.
The concert will be held at 8:00 p.m.
in Doremus Gymnasium.

Ken Lane, president of the senior
class, is President of Finals, which
also includes a dance on Thursday,
June 4, in Evans Hall. Entertain-

ment for the dance is yet to be re-
vealed.

* With “Don’t Let the Rain Come

Down” (or “The Crooked Little
Man”) now among the Top 10 songs
in the nation, the Serendipity Sing-
ers have completed rise to the big-
time which began at the University
of Colorado and was extraordinarily
fast. The group consists of seven
men and two girls and its sound re-
calls the New Christy Minstrels who
became nationally popular last year.

The name “Serendipity” means,
according to Webster, “having the
faculty for making an unexpected
discovery of a new and_ happy
event.” The word is taken from
the Prince of Serendip, a fairy tale
character who possesses the faculty
of being “serendipity.”

The Serendipity Singers started
out at the University of Colorado
several years ago, at first being
composed of “a business administra-
tion student, a prospective ancient
historian, a would-be psychologist
and a bunch of music majors.” After
a great deal of success at college
functions, they picked up two gradu-
duates from the University of Texas
and the group was completed.

At this point they were “discov-
ered” by Fred Weintraub, owner of
The Bitter End in New York. Wein-
traub is the discoverer of Peter, Paul
and Mary, Woody Allen, and Bill
Cosby, as well as the possessor of
the same name as Lynne Weintraub,
one of the outfit’s two girls.

Weintraub ran the group in the
Bitter End for several months to
capacity crowds. Since this beginning
they have contracted with Mister
Kell in Chicago for a headline ar-
rangement, and have recorded a
long-playing album.

The “Hootenanny” television
shows have signed them to make
six appearances.

Croft commented on the singing
of the Serendipity Singers, “We are
lucky to have contracted with them
some months ago, before they reach-
ed the top. Because we spotted them
before they reached national popu-
larity, we were able to sign them for
a price which they wouldn’t look at

”

now.

There will be a meeting of the
Ariel staff Thursday, 7 p.m., in the
English Seminar Room. Anyone in-
terested in working on the staff next
year is urged to attend.

A Word About W&L’s ‘Fallen Men’

If a young woman was either raped or seduced in
pre-twentieth century society, she was thereafter con-
sidered “beyond the pale” of respectable people—she
was a fallen woman. However naive she might have
been at the time of her misfortune, whatever the emo-
tional circumstances framing that unhappy occasion
might have been, she was forever after an outcast—
indeed, she might as well kill herself, for her life was
over.

This theme, treated as it has been by some of the
most famous novels in English literature (Clarissa,
Tess of the D'Urbervilles), has a parallel here at Wash-
ington and Lee. A student who is convicted of lying,
cheating, or stealing (or failure to report such a viola-
tion) is considered by W&lL society a “fallen man.”
He is forever beyond the pale of Washington and Lee.
Like a malignant tumor, we cut him from our midst,
and give him twenty-four hours to get out of town
He knew the conditions of honor at W&L when he
enrolled; therefore, he deserves what he gets.

To try to salve our consciences, we do various
favors for these fallen men once we've made
sure they are a safe distance away. We go out
of our way to explain to other schools (which
inquire about the circumstances of the depar-
ture of our fallen men) that we, Washington and
Lee, are special—we treat honor violators se-

verely so we may maintain our strict code of
honor. Just because a student is compelled by
us to leave, is no indication that he is forever
dishonorable. Favorite professors of the rejected
student may write letters of recommendation for
him. Perhaps it is easier for us to sleep at night
once these things are done.

It seems strange to us, therefore, that when we are
willing to do so very much to help some of these
fallen men once they’ve gone, we remain unwilling
to reach a little deeper into the cup of compassion and
grant that fallen man a chance to redeem himself—to
redeem himself here in our midst, where it will count
the most. But ah, yes—if we let these fallen men back,
the honor system will weaken. It will crumble over the
years by slow erosion. It would be like inviting can-
cer to come back again after the operation to remove it
has been completed. So we must stand firm.

Well—in a way, we admire the students, professors,
and administration officials who have conditioned their
hearts to the extent that they can accept this situation.
We know it’s not very easy at times for anyone—
especially for those students who must hear the cases
and pronounce the sentence. But please, don’t be too
hard on us because we, somehow, can’t bring ourselves
to place a rigid system above the eternally wavering,
often weak, but ever worthy human soul.

 

Honor System Fraught With Inqustice

The most significant and most valuable student
institution at Washington and Lee is the honor system.
As the catalogue says, “the honor system is not some-
thing to which only lip service is paid.” Confidence
that one’s class standing is valid; confidence that a
mis-placed coat will stay in the spot where it is left;
confidence, as a professor, that all students’ work is
honorable—this is only part of the crop of advantages
which we reap from our honor system.

But we believe there are a few aspects of this sys-
tem which should be carefully examined—and, per-
haps, modified. We hope none of the many members of
the W&L community who have come to cherish the
honor system will begrudge us the opportunity for
such an examination. We do not wish to direct a bar-
rage of useless criticism at what is certainly Wé&L’s
greatest tradition, on the contrary, we hope our sug-
gestions will help to strengthen an honor system which
has come under serious question by some members
of this student body.

The Executive Committee operates the honor
system under the assumption that honor is an
“absolute.” A former EC member believed that
since the man who steals an orange and the man
who steals a wallet both go through the same
thought processes in deciding to steal, they both
deserve the same punishment under our system.
We question the absoluteness of honor. We be-
lieve there are degrees of honor. And this is the
crux of the dispute.

There is a big difference between the student who,
without any premeditation, impulsively cheats on a
quiz, and a student who deliberately and cold-blooded-
ly steals money from his roommate over a long period
of time. The action of the first student is essentially
out-of-character—he acted without thinking about his
action; the second student’s actions, on the other hand,
are an integral part of his character. Thus, the degree
of honor which is sacrificed by the first student is con-
siderably less than that which is lost by the second
student.

Once we realize that there are degrees of honor,
then we must logically conclude that there should be
degrees of punishment. But our honor system has

only one punishment—the maximum one. As late as
1820, England issued the death penalty in over 200
different crimes; as late as 1964, Washington and Lee
issues its own capital punishment, and it does so
arbitrarily, with no thought whatsoever given to the

essential, over-riding character of the violator. W&L’s
fallen man may have cheated under circumstances of |:
extreme emotional stress and after giving his action |:
no previous thought; or, he may have been systemat- | >
ically, deliberately cheating over a period of months— |‘

but we place both students in the same category.

Last year a student who sat on the EC for two
years said: “From my experience, I believe that
there are few premeditated honor offenses com-
mitted here. Most occur in a moment of thought-
Jessness or because the student has not taken
time to familiarize himself with the rules as they
apply to a particular course.” If we are to be just
at W&L, we must allow a flexibility in the ad-
ministration of our honor system which will pro-
vide for such students.

Those students who oppose any penalty less than
permanent expulsion say that if we suspend certain
violators for a year, and then allow them to return,
we will make a “punitive system” out of the honor
system. Let us not delude ourselves. From the moment
a student is expelled from W&L on an honor viola-
tion, the system becomes punitive—indeed, it punishes
the student with a penalty most extreme. And long
after we, who allowed that student to be expelled,
have forgotten his name and his face, he will have to
live with the emotional, psychological, and academic
consequences of his expulsion,

Other opponents of a one-year suspension penalty
imply that to allow the fallen man to come back would
be to endanger the rest of the student body—the faith-
ful. It is rank foolishness to believe that the purity of
the rest of W&L’s students would be in jeopardy if an
honor violator were allowed to associate with them
once again. It is about time that the inflexible judges
who have laughed in scorn for one full year at the
suggestion that our honor system is too extreme and
too rigid begin to take seriously what is certainly
W&L’s most serious and flagrant injustice to its stu-
dents.

 

The Risks In A Goldwater Nomination

Last week in an article which summarized Sen.
Barry Goldwater’s current strength, Time Magazine
estimated that he will have at least 550 delegates on
the first ballot going into July’s GOP convention. That
tally does not include California, nor any favorite son
states, nor any “at large” delegates whose sympathy
may lie with Goldwater but who are remaining un-
committed for the time being.

For example, Time does not include Kentucky's 18
convention votes on its tally for Goldwater because
it assumes Thruston Morton will be a favorite son on
the first ballot. Our Steering Committee was told
Morton would not hold back his delegation even on the
first ballot, and thus Time’s estimate could be 568,
and still be conservative. Time awarded Goldwater no
votes at all in states like Massachusetts, Michigan,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington and West Vir-
ginia, where we know there are between three and
ten Goldwater delegates at least.

Although there are numerous states in which Time's
estimates are two or three votes lower than ours there
are some others in which Time gave Goldwater sub-
stantially more votes than we did: in Illinois, Time
gave him 47 while we gave him 36; in Missouri, Time
gave him 20 while we gave him 12; and, we awarded
Arkansas’ 12 votes to Winthrop Rockefeller on the
first ballot, but Time gives them to Goldwater.

It thus appears that if our first ballot total
was high—as many people think it was—it was
not very high, probably not more than 10 or 15
votes. Our convention was indisputably right in-

sofar as it tried to reflect the present status of the
Republican candidates, and particularly the dele-
gate-strength of Barry Goldwater. There were,
however, some rather disappointing shortcomings
to the convention.

One such shortcoming was the refusal—explicit and
vocal—on the part of some state chairmen to even
attempt to interpret the effect on their states of Cal-
ifornia’s support of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. We can-
not be sure what will happen in California on June
2, but we know that it will be a turning point one
way or the other for Goldwater. As Time reported:
“Goldwater has placed his political prestige squarely
on the line in California, to the point of saying that if
he does not win in California, he doesn’t deserve the
nomination. Thus, a California loss might cause second
thoughts in the minds of some delegates who presently
favor Goldwater.”

In the Arizona Senator’s own opinion, therefore,
we should not have nominated him. The reason we
went ahead and did so anyway might be a lack of fore-
sight on the part of some state chairmen, or it might
be the lack of fluidity which characterizes Goldwater
backers, or it might be a sincere but rebellious re-
fusal to believe the decision we made on California
was the correct one. In short, our convention was me-
chanically perfect as a mirror of the present; as a fore-
cast of the future—which it is supposed to be—it may
have been a little short-sighted.

We must keep in mind one thing: Barry

The ’64 Mock Convention in Retrospect

 

By WYATT E. DURRETTE, JR.

In the political aftermath of the
Mock Convention one question,
above all others, is significant: were
we right? All
other issues—can
he beat LBJ? is
he the most pop-
ular Republican?
will the party
unite behind him?
etc—are irrelevant
except as they
bear on the accur-
acy of our deter-
mination.

In my opinion
we are right. And
the confirmation next July will add
the final star to the crown of a
convention that J, among untold
others, consider a resounding suc-
cess.

Primarily, I believe we are right
because of the immeasurable confi-
dence I have in 53 talented and
hard-working individuals, who as
state chairmen, studied assiduously
for almost a year the trends and
developments in their states in order
to cast their votes on May 5. But
most of them were not satisfied with
their own judgment, as a look at
the telephone records will tell you;
so they sought instructions from

 

Durrette

party “pros” in all parts of the

 

country.

Numerous phone calls were made
in an effort to re-evaluate states
which might be affected by the out-
come of the California primary. In
fact there were less than 10 state
chairmen who failed to seek tele-
phone evaluations between the an-
nouncement of the California and
Oregon requests and the end of the
balloting on Tuesday.

In the May 8th issue of Time mag-
azine a projection of Goldwater's
delegate strength was attempted.
And as the article stressed, “the
canvass, based on conversations with
state and county Republican leaders
over a national telephone network,
was deliberately cautious: where-
ever a delegate’s loyalty was in
doubt, his vote was not counted in
Goldwater’s column.” The following
was the listing of 29 states and their
first ballot votes which totaled 550
for Goldwater. For the same 29 states
our state chairmen gave the Arizona
Senator only 524 first ballot votes.

CBS News Prediction

On Wednesday night CBS news
after a nation-wide canvass of their
correspondents predicted that Gold-
water would have a minimum of
564 first ballot votes, and they ac-
knowledged that this was most prob-
ably low.

Both of the above were without
California.

 

Convention Estimation Is Defended

Following his speech at VMI Fri-
day night, the AP correspondent
who has been covering Goldwater’s
campaign told me that barring de-
velopments which no one could now
foresee, he felt certain that we were
correct.

In the light of these facts and
many others too numerous to men-
tion, it seems childish and vindictive
to suggest, as some are doing, that
personal sentiment of steering com-
mittee members or state chairmen .
guided or influenced this selection.
Anyone who is capable of being ob-
jective realizes that this is patently
absurd.

Convention Was Beyond Emotion

If we are wrong, and I do not
think we are, it is because we were
honest, objective and diligent. It is
because the state chairmen followed
their consciences, their minds and
their instructions from Party Lead-
ers—not their personal emotions.
And if this made us wrong we need
apologize to no one.

Political predictions is a_ risky
business, but the record of W&L’s
suecess is an enviable one. I have
every confidence that this July in
San Francisco our choice will be
confirmed, and those who contrib-
uted to this monumental task can
be proud of their role in extending
our record to 9 for 13.

 

“If you don’t like things the way
they are here, why don’t you go
someplace else where you'll be more
happy?” This attitude, so often ex-
pressed here at Washington and Lee
is perhaps the most dangerous enemy
that can plague the academy.

For a university’s success or fail-
ure depends on the extent to which
it challenges the minds of its stu-
dents to confront new, often un-
palatable ideas. And it follows that
the success of a student’s own edu-
cation depends on the extent to
which he is willing to take up the
challenge and expose himself to “the
other side.”

If there is no dissent, or if, as
is increasingly the case here, the
dissent is ignored or suffocated by
paternalistic nodding, there can be
no opportunity for growth and
flexibility in the minds of students,
and inquiry succumbs to sterile
stability.

Again and again we are told that
Washington and Lee is a conserva-

 

tive institution, and indeed it is, to

 

A Look at Washington and Lee

 

the marrow of its alleged bones.
Here the status quo is a way of life.
Here enthusiasm, eccentricity, and
dissent share the same trash can.
Honor is absolute. Coats and ties
make the gentleman. If we ignore
the integration problem long enough
maybe it will go away. Lee’s in his
tomb and all’s right with the world.
Who are we kidding?

How easy it is for us to blindly
aecept “time-tested” formulas, the
worn cliches, and believe they are
the best. But are they really time
tested? No concept can be tested
without criticism, and yet our tra-
dition-bound, monolithic attitude in-
creasingly makes any attempts at
criticism worthless folly.

The point I'm trying to empha-
size is that dissent for the sake of
dissent is not only acceptable, but
vital and necessary. We need more,

assume that we are getting any,
kind of an education at Washing-
ton and Lee?

Those who merely pay lip-serv-
ice to our traditions and _ beliefs,
without seeking the inward dispo-
sition that alone can make them
meaningful obviously don’t love
this University. For love implies the
courage to submit our beliefs to
criticism and judgment, and any be-
liefs incapable of standing in the
face of criticism are simply not
worth holding.

We must realize that the motive
for dissent is concern, not scorn,
The true dissenter, like the phy-
sician, seeks only to exercise
what is infectious, to nurture what
is good and healthy and ultimately,
to heal.

Unless we are all bold enough to
give honesty a new birth of free-
dom, ten years from now Wash-
ington and Lee will still be a small,
white, men’s “liberal arts” college
nestled snugly in the Shenandoah
Valley. Nestled? No, buried....

“Fellini’s 842” begins next Sun-
day at the Lyric. It is director
Federico Fellini’s story about a di-
rector directing a movie. “Paris
When It Sizzles” is writer George
Axelrod’s story about a writer writ-
ing a film script. It is supposed to
start tomorrow but probably won’t.

Perhaps it is unfair to write about
“815”, comparing it to “Paris When
It Sizzles.” Certainly the latter is
much less entertaining, much less
imaginative, and much less brilliant
than the former. However, since the
approach is somewhat similar there
is room for comparison.

Director Analyses Profession

“814” has been called, and prob-
ably is, a personal statement by
Fellini about his profession. The di-
rector in “8144” is named Guido and
is played by Marcello Mastroianni.
The film is made up of a series of
sequences, some actual experiences,
some dreams, and some memories. It
begins with an eerie dream which
Guido is having, wherein he is about
to suffocate in a car, while people
all around him watch, some indif-
ferent, some interested, some occu-
pied in a world of their own.

All these people watching are
people who are in contact with
Guido in the real world. This scene
may well be the key to the entire
movie.

Life at the Sanitarium

 

 

The story is simple. Guido has

‘Draft Heinzerling’ Move Begun,
SAE’s Announce A Favorite Son

The general principal that students
become more apathetic and con-
servative as they get older may be
true, but at least there is one ex-
ception. John Z. Heinzerling, a
senior who will return to law school
next year, is branching out into the
new activity of town politics.

The SAE house has announced
the opening of the “Draft John Z.
Heinzerling for Mayor” campaign
headquarters. The campaign was
kicked off during the Mock Con-
vention, and is being managed by
L. Dickinson Barker.

At a press conference yesterday
Barker told his interviewers that
Lexington needs fresh blood in of-
fice, and that now is the time to do
it. He reminded the listeners that
in the upeoming elections the race
will be wide open, since ex-Mayor

 

Holstein has become a judge, and
the temporary mayor, Pat Brady of
W&cL, has expressed great reluctance
to run in the race.

Heinzerling, says Barker, is not
so reluctant. He has promised to run
if he feels the draft movement is
“sincere and honest.”

Heinzerling’s support thus far
seems to be coming from a promi-
nent group of senior citizens who
have been his associates since he
came to Washington and Lee. This
is Heinzerling’s fifth year at W&L,
and he seems to have a thorough
grasp of Lexington’s problems by
now.

Heinzerling’s platform is unclear
but there have been rumors that he
favors a crash program to enlarge
ABC facilities.

Michaeles, Frost, Bowersox
Star Against Towson

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Columnist

The Washington and Lee lacrosse
team guaranteed itself a winning
season Saturday by nipping Tow-
son, 5-4, on the victor’s field. John-
ny McDaniel, W&lL’s potential All-
American sticker, paced the Gen-
erals’ attack with three goals as
they prepped for the season’s big
game Thursday against University
of Virginia at Charlottesville.

The Cavaliers have only a 5-5
record this season, but have lost to
five of the top teams in the country
and have beaten Maryland, who now
is the proud owner of a 10-3 mark.
The Generals will carry a 5-3 record
into the game.

The Wahoos are paced by their
little midfielder Snowdy Hoff, one of
the many Baltimore residents on
the team. Hoff has been called the
“heart” of the UVa. team by the
coaches of the opposition. He ap-*
pears to be their best bet for All-
American this season.

Virginia Is Big

Virginia has been inconsistent this
year, partly because of injuries. Dar-
rell, one of the best men on the
squad, will not play against the
Generals, Tuesday because of a bad
leg.

The Cavaliers are not blessed with
a great goalie, but make up for his
deficinces with a strong defense. The
defensemen are big, as are the at-
tackmen. Virginia is experienced and
a good passing club, They will use
numerous formations on offense to
keep the defense off balance.

Good Defense Saturday

The Generals displayed the de-
fense Saturday that should handle
the Wahoos’ offense fairly well, as
they held Towson to only four goals.
Pete Noonan did an outstanding job
in the goal.

Mike Michaeles and Bob Frost
added one goal each to McDaniel’s
three Jay Bowersox played an out-
standing game, recovering 13 ground
balls and controlling a vast majority
of the face-offs.

Congratulations to the Friday

again, boys.

Last week you reported that
there were FIVE teams in the
CAC, but your cartoon (and I
still fail to see exactly what it
is implying) shows only four of
the conference members. Is
Southwestern up inside the bell,
or are they just out buying beer
for the rest of the members.

If you boys keep up this good
work (“Better Sports News”)
maybe you'll soon get paid like
you said the W&L lacrosse team
was going to do to Towson.

Gasque, Essex, Mynttinen
Win; Runners Place Third
In 2nd CAC Tournament

By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor

Gay Gasque, promising freshman
track star, led Washington and Lee
to a close third place finish in track
at the CAC tourney Saturday by
breaking both the conference and
W&L school records in the shot-put
with a toss of 48 9 3/4”.

Shot Put Record

Gasque’s record breaking put
came on his last attempt and edged
the former conference champ,
George Norwich, by 3/4 of an
inch. Rick Mynttinen and Skip
Essex also helped the Generals’
cause with first in the javelin and
440-yard run respectively. Mynttin-
en’s winning toss of 175 feet was
just five feet from the record, while
Essex’s 51.0 run missed the record
by half a second.

As in the overall conference stand-
ings, Washington University ran
away with track competition, win-
ning easily over Sewanee, the clos-
est competitor, 119-58. Washington
and Lee edged Southwestern, 36-33,
for the third spot, with Centre fin-
ishing last with 16 points.

Injuries Hurt

Other track and field men who
supported the W&L cause—depleted
by the loss of the Kell brothers, out
with pulled ,muscles—were Hank
Hendrickson, who placed third in
the javelin; Jim Thompson, who
had a third in the 880-yard race; and
John Graham, who was edged by
two Washington U. record breakers
and had to settle for a third place
in the pole vault.

Generals Finish With 65
Behind Sewanee, and S.W.

Several bad breaks, injuries to
key participants, and too much aca-
demic work hampered Washington
and Lee in the second annual Col-
lege Athletic Conference spring
sports festival, and the Generals had
to be content with a last-place tie
in the final conference standings.

Washington University of St. Louis
repeated last year’s sweep and
walked off with the coveted CAC
bell. Washington U.’s point total of
125 put them well ahead of the near-
est competitor, Sewanee, whose
overall total was 100, and South-
western, close behind the Tigers
with a point output of 95.

W&L and Centre tied for the last
position, both scoring a total of 65
points throughout the year. Con-
ference points are accumulated in
six sports—football, basketball, track,
baseball, tennis and golf—with the
| winners of each individual sport
earning a replica of the bell trophy.

Jay Clark Is Initiated
Into Debate Fraternity

John W. Clark, Phi Gam Senior,
has been named Washington and
Lee’s first initiate into Tau Kappa
Alpha-Delta Sigma Rho honorary
debate fraternity.

Formerly initiated students out-
standing in the forensics into Tau
Kappa Alpha, but that fraternity was
merged this year with Delta Sigma
Rho, which was a separate frater-
nity of similar nature.

Clark has debated at W&L for
four years, and twice has_ been
elected captain of the debate team.
He was a member of two state
championship teams, and another
year was recognized as the out-
standing speaker at the state meet.

The holder of a Robert E. Lee Re-
search grant in debating, Clark has
also served in an advisory capacity
to underclassmen in the debate pro-
gram. Clark is a Dean’s List stu-
dent majoring in history. His home
is in Birmingham, Alabama.

Requirements for membership in
Tau Kappa Alpha-Delta Sigma Rho
are outstanding achievement in de-
bating during at least two year, and
a scholastic standing in the upper
third of the class.

THE RING-TUM PHI

The Risks In A Goldwater Nomination

(Continued from page 2)

Goldwater is not acceptable to all Republicans.
Some _ professional Republicans—Sen. Jacob
Javits notably—have flatly declared they will
not support a Goldwater candidacy. Goldwater
backers may blandly say that their man could
care less—or, they may say that in the end all
Republicans will swing behind Barry. We pre-
dict that with Goldwater running, many Repub-
licans will just stay home on election day, and
that many influential members of the GOP will
be making no efforts to get their constituents to
support the party.

Most important is the fact the GOP professionals
are not giving up—they want to win. As Marquis
Childs said last week, “Astute men like Ohio’s Ray
Bliss want to win. They are not happy at the thought
of either suicide or of a wrecking operation with the
wreckers controlling the party machinery. The Amer-
ican press has treated Goldwater unmercifully. His
supporters laugh at Walter Lippmann and Joseph
Alsop, but the fact remains that those two men, among

 

others, have done an excellent job of making many
voters “scared to death” of the Arizonian. And when
a popular medium like television and a popular pro-
gram like “That Was the Week that Was” bitterly sat-
irizes a candidate (Goldwater was named the man who
would make the worst president by TW-3 last week),
Republicans need to face up to the fact that if Gold-
water is nominated, he will be massacred in Novem-
ber.

A humiliating defeat of Goldwater might mean the
loss of several important GOP seats in the House and
Senate. That in turn would mean the passage of some
legislation which no Republican wants. There would
be no way to stop it. We suggest that it is about time
some Goldwater people stopped thinking so much
about their candidate and conservatism, and _ start
thinking about their party, and the beating it will take
in November if Goldwater runs. The American two-
party system is weak enough as it is; unless the Gold-
water camp backs away from “Barry or secession”
and excepts a representative candidate, the GOP may
lose a lot of its waning power.

 

‘Paris When It Sizzles’

(Continued from page 2)

appear that Fellini has merely
tricked his audience into allowing
him to place these innocuous scenes
of his memory before them. Indeed,
as I sat through it the first time,
this began to occur to me,

Yet the main story is about his
own life, about the trials of being
an artist, in particular a motioi. pic-
ture director, and the difficulty that
lies in trying to make a film one
man’s personal statement. Yet in
presenting this, Fellini succeeds in
doing exactly what the director in

 

the film is unable to do. His film |
is a major landmark in the cinema; |
it is a director’s movie, and must be
considered one of the real master-!|
pieces of cinema.

Unfortunately, “Paris When It}
Sizzles” is not. Axelrod is playing a|
funny joke on the movie-going pub- |
lic. William Holden plays a seript|
writer who must write a movie|
script in 24 hours. Audrey Hepburn

is his assistant. The audience is taken
through a miriad of plots all de-
signed to bring the hero and heroine
together for a last scene kiss despite
seemingly insurmountable odds.

The joke is obvious. While we
watch Holden and Hepburn write
this script intended to bring the
actor Holden and the actress Hep-
burn together, Axelrod is slowly
bringing the real actor Holden and
actress Hepburn together. The idea
itself is somewhat clever and much
of the movie is too. Yet too often
we are taken on some useless and
unfunny diversion, put in only as
filler. If this too is part of the joke, *
then it is a bad one. Perhaps, though,
the funniest thing about the movie is

| the fact that simply because Holden

and Hepburn are in it, it will be a
smashing box-office success. And
because no matter what you may
think of the merit of the film, George
and William and Audrey will all
have the last and loudest laugh.

AN OPEN LETTER |

TO THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN OF

SOUTHAMPTON’S DEBUTANTE PARTY

WE READ A STATEMENT in the Press made by’
one of the young defendants after the court
case involving alleged damages at a debutante
party in Southampton, Long Island: “Every-
one knows there is too much drinking in this
country, but what can you do about it? Every-
body knows the morals of this country are
going down the drain.”

WE THE UNDERSIGNED believe we have the
answer to the young man’s question.

We believe it is time our generation stopped
self-righteously deploring this state of the
nation or irresponsibly contributing to it. The,
time has come to change it.

REPRESENT hunvdreds of young Americans
across the nation who have committed their
lives to create a new society in America and
the world with the global program of Moral
Re-Armament.

WE ARE IN REVOLT against a society which cre-
ates the climate of immaturity and lawless-
ness that leads to such a debacle and to such a
cynical statement. We have got to stop it.

WE ARE IN REVOLT against the gutlessness of
1 “good” Americans who lack the courage to
4 explode the corruption existing in all levels of
our society, who sit silently while one woman
| forces God out of our schools, who permit men
a8 committed to atheism and anti-God to proceed
7 unchecked, who proclaim one set of standards

and live another.

WE ARE IN REVOLT against the line of the “new
morality” which is forced down our throats
by books, magazines, television, films, profes-
sors and some churchmen. Sex, violence, lust
and godlessness are taking over the nation.
When venereal disease among young Ameri-
cans rises 130% between the years 1956 and
1961, when 18,000,000 children come from
broken homes—who is responsible? We are.

{

WHERE ARE THE YOUNG AMERICANS who
will pay the price in their own lives to stand

up for what is right in the country? Where

are the fighting Americans who will cure the
hatred, bitterness, impurity and selfishness

WE

 

 

| which divide families, destroy races, deaden
youth, split nations?

‘THE FREE WORLD looks to us for leadership. :
The captive world looks to us to make freedom Bi
a reality again. We know that if America fails
the world fails.

WE ARE OUT TO BUILD A NATION where fami-
lies teach mankind how to live together, where
industry management and labor—teach the
whole world how to work together, where all
races, colors and classes learn together with
all nations how to lead the whole world for-
ward. We are out to create a force of young
Americans more dedicated to building a world
that works than any Communist or material-
ist. We will create an America to whom the
whole world will turn and say, “That is the
way men are meant to live.”

WE BELIEVE IN MODERN AMERICA. We be-
lieve she will rise to the challenge of the times.
We believe she will demonstrate the great re-
ality that free men will accept of their own
accord the discipline to be governed by God,
so that millions on the earth will never be
ruled by tyrants.

THE CHALLENGE facing the American youth is
not to go backward to the decadence that de-
stroyed the Roman Empire, but to go forward
to the revolution of Moral Re-Armament.

WE CAN REBUILD THE MODERN WORLD. Let p
us go forward to absolute moral standards for :
all men everywhere: absolute honesty, purity,
unselfishness and love, not as an end in them-
selves, but as a means for giving us the en-
ergy, the maturity, the responsibility, the
clarity that will take humanity forward to the
next stage in human evolution.

THREE THOUSAND OF US are meeting this sum-
mer in a Conference for Tomorrow’s America
at the Moral Re-Armament Center, Mackinac
Island, Michigan, to shoulder that task to-
gether. We invite every young American who
has the courage and spirit to care for his na-
tion and the future of mankind to join us,
