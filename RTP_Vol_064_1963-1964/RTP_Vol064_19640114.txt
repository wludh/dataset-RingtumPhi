Tour Continent
For Only $269

Sabena Belgian World Airlines in|
cooperation with Arthur Frommer’s |
“$5-A-Day Tours, Inc.,” has worked
out a European tour program for |
students which features 30-day bus.
tours of Europe and the continent for
$269 plus cost of the air fare. |

Frommer, author of the best-sell- |
ing pocket book, “Europe on Five
Dollars A Day,” has set up the tours
to take advantage of a new vehicle |
known as the “Minibus” which seats
groups of 12 or 21. The “Minibus” |
carries camping equipment including |
tents; sleeping bags; stoves; air mat- |
tresses; cooking and eating utensils. |

Leisurely Pace |

“Student travelers only have to
bring clothing and personal sup-
plies,” Frommer said. “The tours will
cover ground at a very leisurely
pace with never more than five

‘hours on the road in a single day.

More important points will be given
comparatively more time. And, each
group will have a_ professional
guide,” he added.

Designed primarily for American
students of 17 to 25 years of age,
the tours starting April 1 will de-
part at two-week intervals through
September 15. In addition, two 30-
day itineraries can be combined and
the 60-day rate comes to $509. One
tour covers Belgium, Holland, Ger-
many, Austria, Switzerland, and
Italy ending up in Rome. The second
tour starts in Rome and covers ma-
jor points in France, Andorra, Spain,
back to France, Belgium and Eng-
land.

Occasional Hotel Stops

Mixed in with the camping will
be occasional stops at hotels and
restaurants. Eleven or more students
may work out their own itinerary if
they choose and leave from Brussels
at any time for approximately nine
dollars a day. Moreover any campus
eager beaver can pick up a free
ticket by booking 15 other students
and all they pay is the regular fare
(or get 10 students at regular fare
and pay half fare.

Details may be obtained through
the Publicity Department, Sabena
World Airlines, Sabena Building,
New York.

 

Notice

Calyx Queen Contest

For some reason the response to
the notice of the Calyx queen con-
test has been quite limited. Less than
10 pictures have been entered. All
students interested in entering the
contest are therefore urged to notify
Syd butler, SAE, or Dick Coplan,
ZBT, at once.

Photos should be black and white,
and of sufficient size and quality.
With very few entries to date, the
chanees of having your picture
printed are much greater, for in
addition to the Calyx queen, six to
eight other girls are selected in the
Calyx Court. Pictures are guaranteed
to be returned in the same condition
as they are received. The deadline
for turning in photos is January 15.

College President Advocates
Five-Year College Program

The undergraduate program in col-
leges of arts and sciences should be
extended to five years and special-
ization by “majors” in these colleges
should be dropped, where possible,
Dr. Francis H. Horn, University of
Rhode Island president, stated re-
cently.

The job of bringing “more wisdom
into the affairs of man and of na-
tions” and in coping with the explo-
sion of knowledge can “no longer be
done ...in the traditional four years,
increasingly being compressed into
three,” he said. Claiming that he
was “not so naive to discount the
importance of specialized knowledge
and professional preparation,” Dr.
Horn said, that nevertheless society’s
need for breadth of knowledge, criti-
cal judgment, and power to reason
are just as significant.

While suggesting that “as much
specialization as posisble be post-
poned to the graduate school, he
also decried the tendency “to mold
the college of arts and sciences in-

 

to a lower-level copy of the grad-
uate school.”

The impetus to re-shape the col-
lege of arts and sciences, he declared,
will not come from the faculty of
this college, since its members con-
stitute a stronghold of conservatism
and are resistant to change. “Real
educational reform will depend upon
the sort of leadership academic ad-
ministrators—deans and presidents—
give to the task,” he added.

After noting that colleges of arts
and sciences will be called upon
to accommodate the largest per-
centage of the booming student
population, Dr. Horn said there is
a trend “to separate sciences from
the humanities and the social sci-
ences.”

If an actual separation does not
take place, some sort of division will
probably be developed to handle
“administrative problems of such a
large segment of the student body
and faculty.”

To Perform

Saturday Afternoon, 2:30

Dakota Staton, contemporary jazz vocalist, is slated to
appear at the Fancy Dress concert according to plans released
today by Ed Croft, president of the Dance Board. The Con-

sert in Doremus Gymnasium will begin at 2:30 on Saturday

Fan Mail Slows
‘Humour’ Mag:
Preview Of FD

Progress to date on the anticipated
Fancy Dress Issue of The Southern
Collegian could be measured in an
eye-dropper. Tain Tompkins, Edi-
tor of the humor magazine, claims
his staff has been delayed in its
work because it has had to spend
so much time answering its mail
as a result of the first issue.

This mail comes in two major
categories, according to Tompkins.
One category is the mail demand-
ing that the magazine be banned
from publication. The other cate-
gory is that mail requesting sub-
scription blanks. So far the letters
asking that the magazine be ban-
ned are in the lead, 1 to 0.

At this time, several articles are
ready to be set. One of these is a
donation from Hollins College en-
titled “Guide To Blind Dating at
W&L.” Tompkins has no comment
on it at this time. The issue will
feature a prep sheet for English
comprehensive examinations. A few
parodies of well-known English
bards can be expected in this sec-
tion.

The photographers moved a little
further west this issue (last time
they only got as far as Buena Vis-
ta), and took some shots of Sweet
Briar’s offerings. In addition to
the photography, the usual crea-
tive art work can be expected.

Last but not least, the Collegian
intends to feature its advertisements.
The usual ones will be available for
perusal, in addition to—perhaps—a
Homestead ad.

 

Combos Signed

W&L fraternities have released a
list of the combos they will have
over the Fancy Dress Weekend. Such
popuar entertaining groups as the
Delacardos, Maurice Williams and
the Zodiacs, Martha and the Van-
dellas, Dr. Feelgood and the Interns,
and The Thornton Sisters will be on
campus .Following is a complete list-
ing.

of Fancy Dress weekend.

Dakota, “one of the most dynamic
new personalities to have joined the
ranks of top commercial jazz artists,”
has just completed a cross-country
tour including appearances at Car-
negie Hall, the Copa Club, and the
Newport Jazz Festival.

Although the concert is usually
held on Saturday evening, Croft
cited two reasons for the after-
noon scheduling. “An afternoon
convert creates a more receptive
audience for a sophisticated artist
like Dakota Staton, while it gives
fraternities a completely free eve-
ning for combo parties.” The
Dance Board also announced that
conventional dress will be worn at
the concert.

Miss Staton’s distinctive vocal
stylings are sometimes blues—like
with an unusual misty quality, some-
times swinging with a light, refresh-
ing beat. In each performance the
Staton sound reputedly creates new
meaning for familiar lyrics, turning
old favorite into “fresh and exciting
musical experiences.”

Miss Staton was born in Pitts-
burg, Pennsylvania, June, 1931
and began her career at seven,
singing with two sisters. When her
sisters married and the trio dis-
solved, she went on as a “single”
attending high school by day and
performing in a Pittsburgh night
club in the evenings. This was the
beginning of a long series of night
club engagements, theatre dates,
and cross-country concert tours.
To mention but a few, she has ap-
peared at Basin Street East and
the Village Vanguard in New York,
and the New Frontier Hotel in Las
Vegas.

After securing a contract with
Capital Records, Miss Staton had
two hits with her first record “What
D’You Know About Love,” and “You
Are My Heart’s Delight,” and the
same year she received the Down
Beat Award for “The Most Promis-
ing Newcomer of the Year.” On her
first album, “The Late, Late Show,”
Miss Staton is accompanied by such
soloists as Hank Jones, piano, and
Jonah Jones, trumpet, and the back-
ground to this album was conceived
and conducted by Van Alexander
with an assist by Hank Jones.

Variety gave the following review
of Miss Staton. “In ballad and rhy-
thm, Miss Staton is in complete
charge of all values and has no
trouble getting the audience on her
side.” Besides her numerous club
engagements, she has performed on
many television shows including, The
Today Show and the Playboy Pent-
house Show.

 

Glee Club Makes Plans
For Coming Spring Tour

Jim Mell, president of the W&L
Glee Club, has announced that his
organization is planning a spring tour
this year in Philadelphia on March
6, 7, and 8.

Although exact engagements have
not yet all been confirmed for the
tour, Mell said last year’s Glee Club
traveled to Attlanta, Georgia, for
concerts at Agnes Scott Women’s
College, the Atlanta Veteran’s Hos-
pital, and the Atlanta Federal Prison.

Other Glee Club concerts an-
nounced by Mell are a joint Easter
concert to be given on the W&L
campus with Randolph-Macon Col-
lege and a concert on April 30 to
be held in conjunction with the
Southern Interscholastic Press As-
sociation Convention which will be
held at W&L.

SIPA is an organization of editors,
reporters, and advisers of high school
newspapers throughout Virginia.

The Value Of An Opinion
When Taken To The Poll

Quizzes and papers scheduled for this last week are
eating up everyone’s time, and with exams looming closer,
it’s hard to write editoriallk—and even harder than ever,
we suspect, to read them. So we'll be brief.

 

We have tried to demonstrate during this past semes-
ter that the Executive Committee operates too much of
the machinery which composes our student government.
It is executive, legislative, and judicial in its function. It
is a perfect example of the concentration of power in a
small group of people.

Our suggestion has been offered in the spirit of conser-
vatism—and if these suggestions have escaped you, rest
assured we shall present them in detail in the coming
months. Our questions are these: Should the responsibility
for judging accused honor violators be vested in a com-
mittee which has many other responsibilities (as is now
the case), or should this awesome task be the duty of one,
single committee—a Judiciary Council? Should the execu-
tive and legislative aspects of student government then be
made the business of a Student Senate? Would such a
governmental structure be better than the one we now
have? Is change, in short, really needed?

The answers rest with you, the W&L student. A
thousand editorials do not have the power of your opin-
ion and your vote. What we want most is that in the com-
ing semester you care—care enough to have an opinion,
to voice that opinion, and to take that opinion to the polls
should the opportunity arise.

Since this request of ours is indisputably aligned with
the American ideal, we fervently hope our critics will see
fit to relax their jaws and put down their quills during
the coming intermission.

Current Cinema
British Director Forbes
Succeeds With ‘L-Room’

By TOM PACE

“The L-shaped Room” is one of those rare films from which,
hopefully, one may learn. If it falls short of greatness, as it does, it
is simply because its writer-director, Bryan Forbes, is a less creative
and less experienced director than writer. For certainly the worthiest
aspect of the film is its story.

Leslie Caron is a 27-year-old French girl who has broken away
from her parents and come to London to claim her freedom. She
wastes little time. At a peaceful resort spot, somewhere in England,
she loses her now stale virginity. And becomes pregnant. And de-
cides she wants it. (It meaning the baby, not meaning to be harsh
towards the kid, but because that is the way the people in the movie
refer to it.

She moves into a low rent flat in a boarding house full of
what might be described as colorful characters: a Negro horn-
blower, a would-be but probably never will-be writer, a kindly
old woman who in her younger days was an entertainer, an
actress, and a lesbian; two whores, one very outgoing, the other
very ingoing; and a nasty landlady who has some man living
with her who I didn’t think was her husband.

Leslie attracts the young writer. After a rather persistent bit
of courting on his part, she becomes attracted to him. They fall
in love, or at least say they do. They sleep together. Then he learns
that she is pregnant. He rebukes her. Thy make up and he indicates
he would like her to get rid of it. A doctor assumes she wants to get
rid of it. The kindly old lady downstairs thinks she should get rid
of it. She wants to get rid of it. And, inevitably, she tries to do just
that.

Luckily, or unluckily, depending on how you think, she fails. She
and the writer become closer. Then, on Christmas morning, he tells
her that the love is gone, after she has given him his Christmas
present. She has the baby and it becomes a she. The writer visits
her in the hospital and gives her a story he has written about them.
She tells him she is going home. She returns his story and does go
home. The movie ends.

And this is indeed the way love (or its reasonable fac-
simile) so often is. There is a pleasant acquaintanceship, fol-
lowed by a period of passion, and then a realization that per-
haps this isn’t all it should be. Forbes seems to imply that re-
lationships are not simply hot or cold, but that they are often
warm. The writer was good for her because she needed some-
one during this lonely period of trial; and she for him because
he had just lost a girl with whom he says he was very much in
love. The film, because of this, might be judged a happy one.
Yet I would disagree. It is sad that their relationship must be-
come only a memory. It is sad that they are unwilling to try to
make it more than that. I think Forbes is making a statement
on the tragedy of human relationships. We must have it hot
or cold. When the heat loses its intensity, we have to let go
entirely.

What he says is true, and because of its truth it is a fine film.
Forbes has written an excellent screenplay. And he has got some
splendid performance. Leslie Caron received the British Academy
Award for her portrayal. Tom Bell, as the writer, deserves equal
credit. And the supporting players were all appropriately cast, and
each quite good in his or her role. Forbes and producer Richard
Attenbrough are a good pair and will doubtless make some fine
films in the future.

 

 

We Were Wondering...

The Winter of Our Discontent, by
John Steinbeck. (Bantam, $ .75.)

In The Winter of Our Discontent,
John Steinbeck has written a confus-
ing story framed in the manner
of a modern tragedy: a man, all
alone, fighting his battle against de-
spair. Ethan Hawley is an idealist
who begins to change because he is
ashamed of his economic and social
circumstances. He wants Mary, his
wife, to be able to hold up her head
with pride. He wants to get a car
for his family, and he wants to own
a TV set. His own daughter, Ellen,
has hit him time and again with
the question: “When are we going
to be rich?”

Ethan is a clerk in a local grocery
store, and he himself must admit
that if it weren’t for the discount on
food which he received, his salary
wouldn’t cover the family expenses,
low as they were. Ethan’s son, Allen,
in his early teens, has already be-
come disillusioned with life; while
the father, Ethan, is an idealist, the
son, Allen, is comparatively world-
wise.

Battle for Idealism

The bulk of the novel centers on
Ethan’s inner conflict: should he
sacrifice his ideals and go through

with what seems a sure-fire plan to
get easy (and dishonest) money?
The more certain the plan becomes
in Ethan’s mind, the more inclined
he is to carry it through; at a crucial
moment, however, fate prevents him
from his plan, only to place him on
the road to another means to quick
cash. This second plan, easier than
the first, is more despicable, and thus
requires the sacrifice of even more
of Ethan’s fast-dwindling idealism.

In the meantime, Ethan’s son is
planning to enter the “I Love Amer-
ica” essay contest, in which he hopes
to pick up some easy money of his
own. Allen has no scruples about the
acquisition of wealth; he intends to
win the contest regardless of the
tactics he must employ to do so. In
the framework of Ethan fighting
against his ideals and Allen giving
such airy things no thought at all,
the two have a talk about money.
Ethan tries to explain to his son that
something-for-nothing is only a
myth, that “it doesn’t hurt the money
to get it that way but it hurts the
one who gets it.” Allen, callous and
calculating, becomes a foil to his
father by replying: “It’s all dough,
no matter how you get it.” Later
Allen wins the contest and Ethan

 
     

catches him rehearsing his accept-
ance speech in front of his mother’s
mirror with mascara on his eyes.

“Well, when the bunting and tin-
sel come down, I’m going to need
your help.’”

“How do you mean?’”

“‘T told you before, to help me in
the store.’”

“IT couldn’t do that,’ he said, and
he inspected his teeth in the hand-
mirror.”

Completely repulsed by his son,
Ethan tells us: “I got out fast and
closed the door and in my bathroom
I ran the water cold and iced my
skin and let the cold penetrate deep
to control my shaking rage.”

Life or Death Climax

The novel builds toward a power-
ful climax involving life and death.
Ethan becomes convinced he is doing
no one much good. He is about to go
out for a walk one night when his
daughter rushes up to him and says:

“Take me with you.”

“Silly, I can’t. But if you will come
in the kitchen, I’ll wash your face.”

Ethan is torn between the convic-
tion that he is “carrying a light” for
his little daughter, and the defeating

Recent Student Poll Reveals...

 

Opinions on Student Government

By GARETH ADEN
Feature Editor

Due to an apparent interest in re-
forming the student government
which was shown before Christmas
by a number of students, the edi-
torial staff of the Tuesday Bdition
of The Ring-tum Phi decided at that
time to conduct a poll of student
opinion on the matter. The poll was
begun before Christmas, and it has
been completed in the past eight
days. While we do not claim the re-
sults as absolutely representative, we
have made every effort to be ob-
jective, and feel it reflects at least
a part of the opinion currently held
by students.

Questions were asked of one hun-
dred students who were divided al-
most equally among the four un-
dergraduate classes. Questions cen-
tered around a suggested re-shaping
of the student government into 1) a
Student Senate for legislative and
executive work and 2) an Honor
Council solely for the purpose of
trying honor violations. The propo-
sal was vague, and it was left that
way in order to get an unbiased
student opinion on their government.

66 Favor Change

In regard to the proposal that
student government here take the
form of a Senate and judicial board,
66 students favored it while 34 dis-
sented.

It is interesting to note the way
the polling went by classes: among

the seniors opinion was evenly di-
vided, while it was slightly in favor
of the proposal among the juniors.
However, in the sophomore and
freshman classes it was clearly in
favor of the proposed change.

It would be hard to determine
whether the split opinion in the sen-
ior class toward the proposal is a
sign of greater knowledge or merely
cynicism towards student govern-
ment.

EC Has Too Much Power

Those students who favored the
change gave various reasons, which
came down to about four main
points. First, most of them seemed to
feel that the Executive Committee
had too much power for so small a
body (12 men). As one student
graphically put it, “Let’s not put all
our eggs in one basket.” Others felt
that the EC had too much to do and
that, although it is an honor to be
elected to that committee, it may be
a liabiliy to one’s scholastic record.
There was a great deal of contradic-
tion as to how much EC members
actually have to do, however.

Many students felt that the stu-
dent government ought to be more
representative so as to give more
people a chance to take part in
student government and also to en-
sure better communication with the
student body. There was a general
feeling that W&L has many good
men who are not given a real chance
to participate in student government.

Finally, some people said they fav-
ored the proposal because they felt
that the jobs of judging honor cases
and legislating required two differ-
ent types of people, and should be
divided.

No Reason To Change

In true debating style, the stu-
dents who were not in favor of the
proposal argued that there was no
reason to change the present system.
Many seemed sure that there was
not that much work for EC mem-
bers to create a real burden. Some
said simply that the student gov-
ernment, they felt, had worked well
in the past under this set-up and
would continue to do so.

Upperclassmen especially felt that
a Student Senate, since it would be
larger than the EC, would be inef-
fective and sluggish in getting things
done. It would simply be “too big to
handle.” One student said he favored
leaving government in the hands of
the faily small EC because, “There
simply aren’t enough competent peo-
ple around to fill a larger group.”

Dissatisfied With EC

Rather surprisingly, many students
who were not in favor of the pro-
posed splitting of responsibility in
government when asked if they were
satisfied with the EC answered no.
One said that he was satisfied but
felt that the student government
could be much better. Some thought
the whole question was ridiculous

Former Student Reports on African Life
As a Member of the Peace Corps Team

Dear Dr. Colvin,

Merry Christmas! One year ago
I hardly thought I would be sending
you Christmas greetings from Africa;
but now that I am settled down
here, it doesn’t seem so strange after
all.

It all started last March when I
learned that I had been accepted by
the Peace Corps. After a ten-week
training program at Cornell Uni-
versity, where we learned every-
thing from Sierra Leone history to
how to deliver a baby, I and about
60 other Volunteers flew to Sierra
Leone and received our assignments.

Sierra Leone is a small country
on the southern coast of West
Africa. It was one of the first areas
in West Africa to be explored by
the Europeans and by the 18th
century, Sierra Leone was doing a
thriving business in the gold and
slave trade. After becoming a
British colony she developed
steadily and the country finally
gained its independence in 1961.
During the years Sierra Leone has
built up a fine road system, and she
takes particular pride in her edu-
cational system. Fourah Bay Col-
ledge, in the capital city of Free-
town, was the first educational
institution of its kind in West Afri-

ca and has often been called the
“Harvard of West Africa.”

I am presently living in a small
village called Jimmi Bagbo, This
quiet place of about 700 Sierra
Leoneons and five Peace Corps Vol-
unteers could’t have given us a
warmer welcome. The Peace Corps
is well respected in the community,
and we equally return this respect.
We have found the people willing
to participate in anything we have
planned and in like manner are
eager to join in their activities. This
mutual cooperation will be more
than idle words during the Christmas
holidays when the Peace Corps
Volunteers in Sierra Leone will work
with the people of Jimmi to build a
library for the town’s primary
school. Instead of finding the many
obstacles which have blocked the
way of Volunteers in other countries
and in Sierra Leone, we have found
it hard to keep up with the enthus-
iasm of the people we are working
with.

While all of this is enjoyable, I
still feel my main job here is to
teach. This I find interesting and
rewarding. I am teaching French
and history to about eighty-five
boys for twenty-one hours out of
the week. The rest of the time is

spent giving medical care to the
students, coaching a debating team
and various other duties.

Perhaps what has impressed me
most about the students is the ser-
iousness with which they regard
their education. To them an educa-
tion is a valuable possession and
not one to be lightly thought of. Of
course, not all of the students feel
this way, and I find the same range
of personalities that one might find
in school back home. However, one
of the most striking things is their
eagerness to learn about anything
now. In the last few weeks conver-
sations in and outside of class have
ranged over subjects such as com-
munications satellites, Berlin, Eng-
lish idioms, current fads and civil
rights.

As Christmas rolls around in Jim-
mi Bagbo, we don’t find Sauta Claus-
es, crowded department stores and
street decorations to remind us of
the season; but perhaps we here have
an even better reminder, a living re-
minder that a little understanding
can help to bring us closer to the
goal of peace on earth and good will
to men.

Merry Christmas and a Happy
New year|

‘Tun Squire:

By ADDISON BROCKENBROUGH

Following are scattered notes
made since the last column on De-
cember 17.

December 20, 1963
Friday

One of Washington and Lee’s most
interesting traditions is the stag
Christmas party, held ordinarily on
the night before everyone goes home.
The gifts usually involve some very
clever and well-worked-out atroci-
ties. The festivities include poems
composed in the spirit of brotherly
affection, and a revised sing of “The
Twelve Days of Christmas.”

This sort of activity often helps
to clear everyone’s addled brains—
with one exception last month. As a
fraternity man opened his formid-
able present, donated anonymously,
he found a very stiff, very dead
skunk.

January 9, 1964
Thursday

The incident of stealing from a
local store during the Thanksgiving
blackout has apparently been re-
solved—the store now claims an
older man, not a W&L student and
his wife, was responsible.

I defend my source for the original
report. The fact is that some towns-
people believed one month ago that
a W&L student had been involved
in the Thanksgiving thefts. It was
already a public matter before I
mentioned it in this column. I felt
that in order to clear the air, it
needed to be even more public. That
the original story has been shown as
untrue is something for which we
all can be grateful. Who started the
original story would be impossible
to determine. The important thing is
that what purported to be a stairi
on W&L has been erased... erased,
indeed, as a direct result of this
column.

January 10, 1964
Friday

Barry Goldwater’s candidacy has
stirred interest, but his refusal to
debate Governor Rockefeller is dis-
appointing. I agree with columnist
Roscoe Drummond, who points out
that Goldwater has twice accused

Cancellation Explained

Sir:

As president of the Student Lead-
ership Forum, and Chairman of its
Steering Committee, I feel I must
comment on the editorial which ap-
peared in the December 17th Tues-
day edition of the Ring-tum Phi.

I can not understand how you got
the idea that the meeting at which
the Forum’s Constitution was to be
= upon “was mysteriously called
oO i”

What in fact happened is as fol-
lows.

Two nights before the scheduled
meeting of the full Steering Commit-
tee I met with the subcommittee re-
sponsible for drafting a Constitu-
tion. In the interim between these
two meetings there was a death in
the family of one of the committee
members and this person was called
home. Knowing that this person was
largely responsible for writing the
constitution and was also one of its
most ardent supporters, in fairness
to him I postponed the meeting of
the full committee until he had re-
turned to Lexington. The mere post-
ponement of a committee meeting
is hardly newsworthy and thus did
not appear “in the page one news
columns” as you feel it should have.

In the future, if you have any
questions about the Student Leader-
ship Forum I shall be happy to an-
swer them. One of the main purposes
of the Forum is to provide an ef-
fective medium for the exchange of
ideas between students. We are not
the “mysterious” organization you
make us out to be.

Respectfully submitted,
JUDSON P. REIS

We “got the idea” from one of
the members of the sub-committee
Thanks for clearing up the “mys-
tery.” —Editor.

Dear Editor:

In the midst of the vigorous at-

Hoopsters Lose

As Wallis Stars

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team continues to be a home
court club. The Generals are three
and one at home, but dropped their
third consecutive game in as many
tries on the road Saturday night at
Richmond Professional Institute, 87-
see

Tonight W&L travels to Bridge-
water to play one of the hottest
teams in the state. The Eagles drop-
ped their game with W&L here early
in December by a small margin, but
they are especially tough on their
home court. They have beaten Old
Dominion and Randolph-Macon, two
of the better small college teams
in the state, and lost a close one to
Hampden-Sydney. The Eagles are
not a tall team, but have a good
shooting club. It will take a top ef-
fort by the Generals to beat them on
their court.

Wallis Scores 23

Don Wallis was the Generals’ lead-
ing scorer with 23 points. Coach Bob
McHenry said that Wallis played his
best game of the year. Steve Sweitzer
had 14 points, while big Bob Spes-
sard added 11 before fouling out.
Unfortunately for the Generals their
leading scorer Lou Paterno was as
cold as the weather. Paterno was
able to score only three points, a
total far below his average.

Coach McHenry was disappointed
with the defensive showing of his
club. He commented, “The boys
played like a team that hadn’t played
for three weeks,’ which describes
the situation well in that the Gen-
erals hadn’t played since their vic-
tory over PMC three weeks ago.

 

Riflemen Lose To

Richmond, UV a.

By JIM BARBER
Tuesday Sports Writer

In a tri-meet between W&L, the
University of Richmond, and the
University of Virginia, the Generals
lost to the larger schools in the rifle
match held Saturday. The Universi-
ty of Virginia took first place with
a team high of 1411 points, with the
University of Richmond and Wash-
ington and Lee close behind with
scores of 1384 and 1356 respective-
ly.

General rifle coach Sgt. James
McSheffrey pointed out that UVa.
shot much better than they usual-
ly do, but noted that W&L had
two outstanding scores as Jones, with
a personal total of 278, and Klick
with a score of 266 led the Generals
on the range.

Coach McSheffrey also noted that
Washington and Lee was out of prac-
tice after the Christmas holidays
and did not do as well in the stand-
ing position. The last General match
before exams takes place this Sat-
urday, and pits the Minks against
the strong military powers, VPI and
VML.

Aside from Steward’s redeeming
pin in 1:42 of the first period in
the heavyweight class, the only other
fall of the evening occurred when
Tom Stover injured his shoulder
early in his 147-pound match and
was pinned by Pfeiffer’s Chris Cordi.
Grappler coach Dick Miller indi-
cated that Stover’s injury was not
extremely serious, but will probably
keep him out of action until the
second semester.

First Matches Close

In the first two matches of the
meet, the Generals were defeated by
the clock both times as Butch West
and Dick Musick both lost because
of the one Pfeiffer point gained on
time advantage. West lost to Dave
Crawford, 3-2, while Pfeiffer Col-
lege’s captain, Art Merrion downed
Musick for his first loss of the year,
7-6.

W&L’s Kimbel White came back,
however, to make the score 6-3, by
outpointing his opponent, Steve
Zimmerman, before Stover’s unfor-
tunate match gave the North Caro-
lina college an 11-3 advantage.

Smith and Winfield

Pete Winfield and Herb Smith,
wrestling at 157 and 177 respective-
ly, both decisioned their men. Win-
field shut out Boyd Stokes, 4-0,
while Smith overwhelmed Doug Mc-
Kenzie, 6-1. Before General Captain
Smith outpointed his opponent, how-
ever, Ed Jansen was defeated by
Pfeiffer’s Bob Hand, 4-1.

Wrestle RPI Next

The tie gained at Pfeiffer brings
the W&L wrestling season record to
3-1-1, with one match remaining
before exams with RPI. That match
with Richmond Professional Institute
will take place at W&L, January
18 at 8:00 p.m.

Football Rules Changed

Coach McLaughlin Lauds
New Substituticn Ruling

By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor

In keeping with the great majority of the nation’s football
coaches, Washington and Lee’s head football mentor, Lee
McLaughlin, today expressed “‘satisfaction” in the changing of
the substitution rules. The General coach pointed out that the
new rule, as he understands it now, will allow more individuals
a chance to play and will reduce to a minimum the headaches
caused by the past complicated rule.

 

 

The new rule, as reported by several of the area’s news-
papers, now allows free substitution whenever the clock is stop-
ped and also permits the entry of two players on any down
even if the clock is running. This is a simplification of the 1963
rule that was so complicated that many of the nation’s colleges
ignored it altogether.

Coach Mac stated that the change will, if anything, help
W&L football hopes for next year. Besides allowing more play-
ers to compete and lessening his paperwork, McLaughlin will
now be able to communicate more directly with his quarterback
and send in directions and/or plays and players immediately
as they are needed instead of waiting, as was the case this year,
until time is out.

One of the main reasons for the NCAA Rule’s Committee’s
stand against unlimited substitution is their argument that they
are endeavoring to create the “all-around” football player.
W&L’s coach implied that in order to do that, (i.e., create an
“all-around” player) maybe every man should be required to
take a turn at playing quarterback to make him more well-
rounded.

The football mentor added that the Rules Committee is
against unlimited substitution also because it wishes to “protect
the smaller schools with limited participation.” But the General
coach pointed out that it was the initially smaller schools them-
selves who were guilty of disregarding the 1963 rule and re-
turning, on their own, to free substitution.

Generals Nip Deacons, 50-45
As Wolfe, Relay Set Records

By SKIP CHASE
Tuesday Sports Writer
A good team effort by the Generals with record times by
John Wolfe and the freestyle relay team of Gary Bokinsky,
Steve Lexter, Bart Taylor, and Bill Wildrick boosted the W&L

swimmers to a 50-45 triumph over the Wake Forest Deacons

 

Saturday evening and upped the*
Washington and Lee seasonal record
to three wins and two losses.

Heralded as a “touch and go” meet
by tank coach Norris Eastman, and
a cruical one concerning a winning
season, the swimmers, led by cap-
tains Walt McManus and Jim Wal-
lenstein (who turned in an excellent
winning performance in the 200-yard
breaststroke with a time of 2:26.1)
won the opening medley relay and
continued to ward off the determined
Deacons.

Deacons Close Gap

Following the medley relay, Wake
Forest rebounded with a Ist and
2nd in the 200-yard freestyle to
close the point gap to 6-3. However,
the North Carolinians saw their
hopes dim as W&L led by Taylor
and George Bokinsky, took first and

second in both the 50 free and 200

Wake Forest gained only one point
in the diving as Greer and Stevens
took second and third, but the Dea-
cons continued to gain as they cap-
tured firsts in the 200-yard butter-
fly, the 200-yard backstroke, and
the 500 freestyle. However, lack of
depth kept Wake Forest from trying

thirds in these events. In taking

Rockefeller of being a Democrat.
Yet, Goldwater’s reason for not de-

not wish to injure the party by de-

As Drummond continues to point
out, if Goldwater is going to accuse
a member of his own party of not
being fit to be a part of that party,
he ought to make the accusation
face to face. If Republicans are go-
ing to have to choose between these
two men, something should be done
to make it clear what ground the
two of them stand on.

|] stant warnings and ridicule from the

ranks of smoking abstainers.

The attack most commonly used
by the smoking antagonists (who,
whether they realize it or not, have
intruded on our American Consti-
tutional right to smoke in peace) is
that we smokers are shortening our
lives every time we light a cigarette.

I would like to answer this by
saying that possibly this criticism
is justifled. Assuming we smokers
will die sooner than the non-
smokers though, I hope these ab-
stainers have noticed the many who
refuse to quit in the midst of all
odds. In fact, most of the non-
smoker’s friends are probably smok-
ers.

For this reason, it is obvious that
we at Washington and Lee should
not quit smoking; in fact, all those
who have not begun smoking should
definitely begin! What fun would
it be if you had to live in the world
when all your friends had died ten
years before you?

Considering the fact that it is
easier to start smoking than to stop
I urge all non-smokers who value
their friends to start smoking. Let’s
all do our share to make this world
a more happy, enjoyable place in
which to live. A world that plays
together should die together.

belief that his son is a loss, his
daughter is intuitive enough to get
along with him, and his wife is
“tough as a boot, unmoving, unyield-
ing, and safe.” The prescription for
this latter belief—“there comes a
time for decent, honorable retire-
ment, not dramatic, not punishment
of self or family—just goodby, a
warm bath and an opened vein, a
warm sea and a razor blade.” This
struggle occupies Ethan’s thoughts
in the closing pages of the novel.

Style Is Incomparable

To say that critics have been mys-
tified by this recent novel by Stein-
beck is an understatement. In my
opinion, though, the novel is an
engaging one, written in an incom-
parable style. Indeed, style is the
novel’s strongest point. I think this
is where Steinbeck’s genius has
shown most consistently, and it is
certainly the most worthwhile aspect
of The Winter of Our Discontent.
Word usage is quick and fresh; de-
scriptive passages are sharp and
vivid. The story flows smoothly,
reads easily.

Behind the style is Steinbeck’s
message, if there is one. He seems to
tion represents the last of the ideal-
ists, and that they are bound to de-
spair. The new generation, disil-
lusioned from childhood, will not fall
victim to the old ideals, but will
make its way in the world by hook
or by crook.

Student Opinion

and others had not thought about it
at all.

Perhaps the wisest statement made
during the survey was, “The idea
sounds good but I simply need to
know more about the _ situation.”
How much work does the EC do
now? Is this work a burden to the
members? How many people would
make up the proposed Student Sen-
ate and would its powers clash with
the proposed Honor Council? These
are just a few of the questions asked
by students.

In conclusion, it appears that
many,—at least half—of the student
body is uneasy about the status quo
in student government. The major-
ity of these have only nebulous ideas
as to what they would actually do
with the student government and
seem to feel that they need to know
more facts about the situation.

ue FASHIONS

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, ESQuire’s FASHION DIRECTOR

If you'll excuse us while we misquote the Post Office motto, “Neither
rain nor snow.nor cold of day can keep us from our appointed
rounds!” Right now, we’re going to tell you about the latest in outer-
wear for the campus, so that rain, src.” and cold of day won’t have
any effect on your appointed—ari fashionable—rounds!

      

-~y JHE LONG AND SHORT OF IT tells the jacket
24°°f" story this fall. Latest lengths range from 34” to
-\ 38”—the better to keep those wintry blasts at
i bay! They’re available in a variety of fabricp—

yy i warm wool fleeces, practical polyester-and-cot-

fee | ton combinations, or newly-revived corduroys

aR 4 oA —styled in standard, single-breasted models.

i -§\< "5° The more traditional waist-length jacket, either

“ = 1 with zip-front or button closure, is still a stand-

‘\:1.. by, especially in gabardine weaves. Most of these

* “models have hoods—attached or zip-on-and-off
—for added convenience and protection.

   

YOUR LOVE CAN KEEP YOU WARM — but linings do it better!

And there’s lots of latitude for you to choose from, both in color
and type of lining. Pile fabrics are very big indeed, ranging from the
natural-fiber, natural-color (tan and brown tones) alpaca pile to
acrylic fiber piles in blazing colors—reds, blues and gold shades.
Plaid wool linings are popular, particularly when they’re back-
grounded or accented with brilliant color—any color, as long as it’s
red! Quilted linings get their quota of votes, too, usually in colors to
contrast with the jacket. And many of these linings spill over onto
the collar facing for a bright exterior accent.

SWEATERED SUEDES are making news. Confusing? Not at all—

these are simply suede jackets with knitted sleeves and back, for
smartness, comfort and flexibility. The knit portions of these campus
cover-ups are often bonded to foam backing—extra insurance
against the cold.

BANK ON BULK — Bulky knits will add new

dimensions to your sweater wardrobe. The real
smashers this season are rough and ready rib-
knits and sweaters with a textured tweed look.
Cardigans are candidates for re-election to top
office, both in button-front shawl-collar models,
and in smart, border-striped styles. Look espe-
cially for the new cardigans zipped and border-
striped up the front and leather-patched on the
sleeves. Pullovers with crew or outsize turtle
necks are knitted of soft, Shetland wools—bulk-
ily, of course!

 

TOPFLIGHT TWEEDS TRANSLATE into topcoats, as well as into

the suits and sport jackets that are making their mark this season.
Look for rugged overcheck and herringbone patterns, styled with
slash pockets and raglan sleeves. If you’re in the market for a more
formal topcoat, why not consider an adaptation of the famous
British Warm? It’s double-breasted, with set-in sleeves, and often
comes with leather button closure. They’re usually found in herring-
bone or heather-mixture tweeds with a somewhat smoother finish.

YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE MAD TO BE HATTED — even on cam-

pus! And you'll be headed in the right direction if you choose one of
the new rough-textured felts, or a sport hat made of corduroy or
tweed. Colorful tweed caps are also making a comeback, to.add a
jaunty, country-squire look to your casual outfits.

WILD HORSES CAN BE SHOD—ana so

should you! Leave your dirty sneakers in the

=@ locker, and try on a pair of sturdy brogues for
yO size—and for a change. Well-polished slip-ons
y in a moccasin design make a nice alternative, as

Ee do brushed or grained leather hi-risers and
boots. And when it’s time for sloshing around in the slush, remember
that the flapping, wide-open overshoe that was a trademark of the
Twenties is now a thing of the past! The current crop are handsome,
sturdy boots, zip-fronted for easy access—a real must for protecting
your leather footgear.

   

So much for this appointed round. Next month, a Command Per-
formance—a run-down on the formal dress that almost reaches
uniform status during the holidays. We'll be there in plenty of time
for you to get it organized. See you then,
