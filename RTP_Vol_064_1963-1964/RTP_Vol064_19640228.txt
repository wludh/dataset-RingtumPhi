Goldwyn, Jr.
To Talk Here

By SAM McCHESNEY

Next Thursday at 7:30 Samuel
Goldwyn, Jr., son of one of the most
celebrated producers in film history,
will speak here on the modern pic-
ture industry.

Mr. Goldwyn has recently com-
pleted producing and directing his
first motion picture, “The Young
Lovers,” starring Peter Fonda, Nick
Adams, Sharon Hugueny, and De-
borah Wally.

Speaks Friday Morning

Under the auspices of Journalism
Professor O. W. Riegel, he will
speak Thursday evening in the
Journalism Lecture Room on “The
Motion Picture Today.” The next
morning at 9:30 in Payne 6, he will
address Mr. Riegel’s Introduction to
the Motion Picture class. The subject
of this lecture will be the production
problems of his not yet relezsed
film.

A graduate of the University of
Virginia, he began his career as a
producer-director of documentary
films for N.A.T.O. One of these pro- |
ductions received first prize in the’
documentary class at the Edinburg
Film Festival of 1952.

Independent Producer

After his work with documentary
films, Goldwyn returned to the
United States and began producing
and directing live television in New
York. Recently he returned to Hol-
lywood as an independent motion
picture producer.

Some of the films he has produced
are: “Proud Rebel,” “Huckleberry
Finn,” “The Shark Fighter,” and
“Man with a Gun.” Presently he is
planning an adaption of Howard
Fast’s novel April Morning.

 

Student Concert Society
Sponsors Organist Taylor

On Sunday, March 1, George Tay-
lor will give an organ recital in
Lee Chapel at 4:15. This recital is
being presented by the newly form-
ed Student Concert Society, an or-
ganization created to encourage in-
dividual talent to perform on this
campus. It will attempt to hold a
variety of concerts including both
popular and classical music to give
all those that are interested a chance
to participate.

This first concert by Taylor will
be of particular interest to those
who appreciate good org organists
and organ music, according to a
member of the Concert Society. Es-
pecially of interest will be the re-
cently restored organ to be used
in the Chapel for the Concert.

Baker, Booth, and Supon

The second concert planned will
present three vocalists who have
already distinguished themselves
through the Glee Club. John Bak-
er, Philip Booth, and Bill Supon will
be on the program Sunday afternoon
at 4 p.m. April 12, This program
will include popular as well as clas-
sical selections.

It is hoped that a third concert
can be held on Friday, April 24,
devoted entirely to jazz and popular
singing by students ensembles.

‘Dr. Faustus’ To Open
Next Thursday Night

By CHARLIE FLIPPEN

Dr. Faustus, the Troubadour Thea-
tre’s second production of this sea-
son, opens next week.

The play will run Thursday through
Sunday. Curtain time is 8:15 p.m.

This year is the 400th anniversary
of the birth of Christopher Marlowe,
author of Faustus. Dr. Cecil Jones, di-
rector of the production, chose this
play, in part, to help commemorate
the event.

Faustus is an Elizabethan play in
the tradition of high tragedy. It con-
cerns the struggle of a young Ger-
man scholar learned in philosophy,
medicine, mathematics and theology,
whose consuming pride and thirst for
knowledge lead him to engage in sor-
cery and magic.

When the play opens Faustus is se-
curing some books on magic from two
of his comrades. Valdes and Cornelius.
With their urging he goes alone into a
grave to conjure.

To Faustus’ delight his incantations
cause Mephistophilis, a devil from hell,
to appear. Amazed with his own suc-
cess, Faustus promises to give Meph-
istophilis his soul in return for
Mephistophilis acting as his servant
and for 24 years of super-human pow-
er.
Mephistophilis returns to hell to dis-
cuss this bargain with Lucifer. Faus-
tus meanwhile listens to the argu-
ments of the Good and Evil Angels.
He decides to make the agreement.

The contract made Faustus begins
|a new career in which he hopes to

 

 

Glee Club Leaves On Tour;

Will Sing I

The W&L glee club departs next
Friday morning, March 6, for the
Philadelphia area and its spring tour.
On the agenda are three singing
engagements.

The first is scheduled for Friday
afternoon at the Shriners Hospital
for crippled children. That evening
the glee club travels to the Tatnall
School in Wilmington, Delaware for
a performance. The high-spot of the
weekend is the Saturday night con-
cert with Beaver College, a girls
school in Philadelphia.

The glee club will present a wide
variety of selections, including re-
ligious pieces by Martin Shaw, Bach
and Handel, folk songs by H. Willan
and J. W. Work, two unusual con-
temporary pieces by V. Persichetti, a
humorous number by C. W. Cadman
and some familiar show tunes by
Kern, Poter and Bernstein.

Baritone John Baker will be the
soloist on a medley from the West
Side Story. Sophomore baritone Rob
Vaughan will have his first solo with
the glee club in “Climb Every
Mountain.” A musical burlesque,

Philadelphia

“Conceited,” soloists will be tenors
Dan Manson and Jim Mell, bass Phil
Booth and baritone Baker. Baker
and Booth will also solo in a number
of folk song selections.

The tours are intended to foster
alumni interest as well as publicize
Washington and Lee to prospective
students. Last year’s tours were to
Wilmington, Delaware, and Atlanta,
Georgia.

Sunday morning the glee club will
sing at the Lexington Presbyterian
Church. This is an annual engage-
ment. This year the group will sing
a number by Bach, “Now Let Every
Tongue Adore Thee” as well as sing-
ing the amens and participating in
congregational singing.

Scheduled for later this spring
are performances with Randolph-
Macon and Longwood college.

Currently being prepared is the
glee club’s second record. Taped

Out of the students interviewed, two
juniors and four sophomores were
elected.

The two juniors chosen were Jon
Supak and Jim DeYoung. Supak, the
newly-elected president of the ZBT
house, is from Virginia Beach, Vir-
ginia. DeYoung, a Phi Kap from Ken-
ilworth, Illinois, is also the president
of his house.

The four sophomores selected were
George Bokinsky, Gene Hatfield, Jos-
eph Richmond, and Ken McGraw.
Bokinsky, who is on both the swim-
ming and track teams, is a Phi Kap
from Petersburg, Virginia. Hatfield, a
Sig Ep from Chattanooga, Tennessee
is the Publicity Director for the Glee
Club.

McGraw, Assistant News Editor for
the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi, is a Phi
Gam from Memphis, Tennessee. Rich-
mond is a Beta from Charlottesville,
Virginia.

The Student Service Society was
formed for the purpose of assisting the
University administration in the field
of public relations.

The chief function of the Society is
the introduction of prospective Wash-
ington and Lee students to life on
this campus from a student’s point of
view. The prospective freshman as
well as applicants for scholarships are
given a tour of the campus with a de-
tailed explanation of Washington and
Lee traditions and _ institutions.

The SSS also aids the administration
in various ways on Parents’ Weekend,
Alumni Weekend, and SIPA Week-
end.

The present officers include Ken
Lane, president, a Phi Delt senior
from Richmond, and Dick Kreitler, a

EC Appoints
Hetnzerling
To Committee

Tuesday night the Executive Com-
mittee appointed senior John Hein-
zerling to the Student Control Com-
mittee, filling a vacancy created by
the February graduation of an old
committee member.

Heinzerling, an SAE from Texas,
is a member-at-large on the Control
Committee. The man whose place he
is taking is Kemp Morton, who fin-
ished law school last month. With
Heinzerling’s appointment the com-
mittee is again at its full strength of
nine members.

President Bill Noell, in announc-
ing the appointment to the Ring-
tum Phi, praised Heinzerling’s qual-
ifications to be a member of the
important committee. Heinzerling
has been on the swimming team
four years, is a Texas chairman for
the Mock Convention, and is imme-
diate past president of the SAE
house.

Heinzerling is also working as
assistant campaign manager for
Goldwater in the convention, is a
member of the intramural board,
and has served his fraternity as
vice-president and rush chairman.
He is a Dean’s List student.

The Student Control Committee,
now in only its second year, handles
matters of student discipline. Sub-
ject to review by the faculty Ad-
ministrative Committee, the student
committee is empowered to inflict
serious punitive measures in cases
of student misconduct.

A Resurrected IFC?

“A ‘do-nothing organization”
whims of ‘The Hill”... ‘‘reeking with apathy and indiffer-
ence.” These are excerpts from editorial attacks of recent
years against W&L’s Interfraternity Council. Such criticisms | ?°
had been rightfully made ever since a decade ago when the
IFC, because it was abusing its authority, had to surrender to
the faculty all its judicial powers over fraternities. This loss
of power had marked the beginning of the end of the IFC
as an influential body.

Last Monday night, the council took a first giant stride
toward regaining its former status. A constitution was ratified
that will place under IFC jurisdiction disciplinary control over
W&L’s eighteen fraternities. This control will be embodied in
a Judicial Board, which will be assuming a great deal of the
prerogatives formerly held by the Faculty Committee on Fra-
ternities.

What restored the faith of the faculty in the IFC that it
should grant this concession? Due credit should be given to
the council’s president Art Broadus and his officers. They
worked long hours during the fall semester to produce a sound
and well-stated constitution. With unusual skill and diplomacy
they overcame their biggest obstacle, that of winning the ap-
proval of the Faculty Committee and fraternity leaders.

The success of Broadus and his officers is a promising move
toward a revived IFC. The competence with which the Judicial
Board, which will be formed next week, will exercise its au-
thority is to be a decisive testing-ground for whether the council
can continue its forward stride. The IFC for the last ten years
has been sharply criticized for its many shortcomings in the
face of unbounded potentiality. Perhaps last Monday was the
starting point for a healthier realization of this potential.

Our Own Kildare:
Hippocrites Hamperman

When raging fever first grew high

And men fell out, they knew not why,

When bodies were racked with terrible pain
And fear of death over all did reign,

A voice above all the tumult rang loud

And in a tone more humble than proud
Proclaimed to all that the end was near,
(For the victims or disease we could not hear.)
The great Doctor Hamperman is at hand

To rid you the pestilence from all the land.

 

Then O great Hippocrites give us your song
Tell us kind sir why you do no wrong

O great Hamperman sing us your song
Dictate to us and we'll go along.

Hippocrites is it the flu that’s so rageous?

How can it be, quoth he, when it’s not contageous.
Then it is pneumonia that causes such treason
“Absolutely not,” and he gave no reason.

Harken to me my wandering fold

It is the simple matter of the common cold.

Then O great Hippocrites etc.

Off my lad and be on your way,

Two aspirin take you every day,

And if by chance you are not better

Your tongue is black and your face is redder
Take four more, and if you’re worse

Don’t call me, call the hearse.

For I am the magnificent Hamperman

Hair so red and face so tan.

Tell to me all of your woes

And Ill diagnose you from head to toe.

Then O great Hippocrites etc.

O wonderful unerring physician

Relieve me of my miserable condition

My stomach throbs, my bowels are sore

Say you can help me, tell me no more.

Hippocrites hesitates, and after much consideration,
Diagnoses the symptoms as constipation.

If a laxative instead of a scapel were used

To rid one of appendecting blues

Hamperman would shine forth like a light

Instead of being engulfed in the darkness of night.

Then O great Hippocrites etc.

And then there was your famous diagnosis

Of calling it tonsilitis when mononucleosis.

Sir Edward Jenner would give you hard knocks

For saying poison oak when it was small pox.

Vesalius, Vicary, and Galen are dead

Now the title “Prince of Physics” lies on your head.

O Prince, your armor is shinning, your steed is jet black,
But the ducks on your pond go “Quack, quack, quack.”

Then O great Hippocrites etc....

Sexual Revolution—Part II

 

Motives—A Measure of New Morality

By KEN LANE

In our first installment, we dis-
cussed the emerging triumph of
contemporary philosophers over the
traditional negativism toward sex.
This triumph is evidenced in the

popular rejection of extreme sexual
repression as an unhealthy outlook
toward a “good and natural” expres-
sion. This “revolution,” of morals,
however, has left us with a void and
we must presently concern ourselves
with a more positive and meaning-
ful approach that will accompany
our break with the past.

Perhaps the most significant
problem in our redefining of val-
ues is the question of premarital
sexual intercourse. It involves one
of the strictest taboos of our moral
heritage, i.e., that sexual inter-
course not performed for the pur-
pose of procreation is evil. From
the traditional viewpoint, a couple
had always to consider the pos-
sibility of childbirth in the indul-
gence of intercourse. A male and
female not prepared or willing to
accept the responsibility for the
consequences of their act were

LETTERS

EpitroR

Editor, Ring-tum Phi

Having read so many interesting
articles of late concerning integra-
tion at Washington and Lee, I
thought I would get off of my lacka-
daisical duff and draw up a work-

 

 

_|able plan for integrating this hor-

rible, bigoted Institution. I hope my
ten point program will arouse some
interest in the student body.

1. Elect members of the student
body to select qualified Negroes to
come visit the University—good
choices for this committee would
be men such as Lamar Lamb, Rod
Cockshutt, Tracy Harrington, Roger
Paine, Jim Ledbetter, and Tom Su-
pak.

2. Bring these “choice” Negroes to
W&L and let them see if they like
our system—let them visit Lee
Chapel and a typical fraternity
house—the Kappa Alpha _ house
would probably extend many cour-
tesies.

3. Get these prospective students

dates at neighboring girls’ schools f

and take them to a combo party.

(The combo should be integrated ot

so no one will be offended.)

4, Require all Washington and Lee| |

students to wear be-bop hats, com-
bo shoes, pegged pants and a red
ear coat so our visitors will feel at
home.

5. Paint one-half of Lee’s marble
statue black so that our visitors
will not seem discriminated against
by one of our founders.

6. Require each student owning

committing a social wrong. Hence,
the fulfillment that an unmarried
couple enjoyed in intercourse was
offset by their anxiety over the
misfortune, the evil, that might
result,

What has pulled the rug from un-
der the feet of the traditional moral-
ist, however, is the improved ef-
fectiveness of contraceptives. “With
modern contraceptives and medical
advice readily available at the near-
est drugstore, or at least a family
physician,” stated a biology profes-
sor at the University of Illinois,

 

 

“there is no valid reason why sexual
intercourse should not be condoned
among those sufficiently mature to
engage in it without social conse-
quences and without violating their
own codes of morality and ethics.”

This advanced technology has not
only removed the basis of the tra-
ditional taboo against premarital
sexual intercourse, it has accentu-
ated the possibility of a second func-
tion, a sacramental function, that
makes more real and personal the
relationship between a male and
female. For the sharing together of

 

this powerful experience may serve
to reinforce the communion of mu-
tual love and devotion that exists
between mature, sincere individuals.

This alternative role of sexual
intercourse runs us into a very
basic problem in the treatment of
morality as a whole—the problem
of motives. It is true, is it not,
that in the final analysis we place
moral judgment of individuals
not on the basis of actions in
themselves, but of the motives be-
hind them. We can condemn no
one unless we know his underly-
ing intentions. Thus, in judging
the rightness or wrongness of an
act such as premarital intercourse,
we can not divorce ourselves from
a consideration of the spirit, the
attitudes, with which the act is
committed, The traditional moral-
ist, whose value systems are so
arbitrarily delineated, failed to
recognize the essentiality of this
added aspect.

It is for this reason that tradi-
tional morality, and in particular
traditional sexual morality, can not
survive in a society of free-thinking,
rational individuals. Such a society
rebels against the idea of having
our decisions predetermined by pre-
scribed rules and conventions. We
reject the purely stimuli-and-re-
sponse existence in which our con-
duct is automatic, unthinking, so-
ciety-conditioned. Consequently, our
future promises a greater freedom
for the individual, in sex and all
of human behavior, to exercise his
reasoning faculties and achieve
fulfillment. The test for our gener-
ration is, are we ready for such
freedom.

Cro--Faun--]o

Party Picks

Dark-Horses As Candidates

By DREW BAUR

With Mock Convention just a
swallow away, political pros in West
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Mary-
land anxiously await the formal can-
didate endorsement of the influen-
tial Cro-Faun-Jo Party.

Right now the party is having
a great deal of trouble deciding
between four pop-
ular, well-known,
and well-qualified
candidates, Wil-
liam  Knowland,
Louis Lefckowitz,
Mike Ditka, and
Sherman Adams.
Although the con-
vention is at pres-
ent deadlocked on
the 69th ballot,
side reports say a
compromise can-
didate is about to be decided upon.
Some speculators are mumbling
that this candidate might be clear
thinking, Byron De La Beckwith.
Whoever the party nominee is, this
decision will affect the nominations
of these important states.

Party spokesman Tom Fauntle-
roy commented, “Within the month,
we expect to have unanimous agree-
ment concerning our candidate and
the campaign wheels will begin roll-
ing within minutes after the candi-
date is announced.”

 

Springs
So far the list of combos for
Springs Weekend is among the
most impressive ever seen on any
college campus. The Crystals, Chif-

 

fons, Orlons, 5 Royals, Maurice Wil-
liams and the Zodiacs, and Dr. Feel-
good are among those already antic-
ipated. This weekend seems to be
rapidly overtaking Fancy Dress as
the highlight of the W&L social

season,
Fights
We certainly hope the wily editor
of the famed boxing pamphlet, the
Ring something or other, will let the
boxing public know about how Son-
ny threw the fight, unless he is too
busy hiding Clay’s casket under the

JFK. Right now, of course, Johnson
does have fantastic national support—
but this can’t last longer than his new-
ness in office and the sharp memory
of the assasination in Dallas.

Gallup and Harris Polls show that
Nixon—with his nemesis Kennedy no
longer on the scene—has the backing
of substantially more Republican Par-
ty members than any of the active
candidates, The fact that he has been
the consistent front-runner in polls of
the rank-and-file is illustrative of the
tremendous advantage he has over
any other noncandidate: a national
name and personality.

Nixon’s years of service in Wash-
ington give him more experience in
foreign policy than any other Repub-
lican candidate—and more than
President Johnson. Nixon’s _ trips
abroad since 1960 haven’t hurt him at
all in this respect, and he is planning
more travelling before long.

If Rockefeller and Goldwater cancel
each other out in the primaries, or if
each proves too extreme for nomina-
tion by the convention, Nixon, obvi-
ously, will be available. If he should
happen to receive an unusually large
write-in vote in the New Hampshire
primary, his position as the compro-
mise candidate would be immeasur-
ably strengthened. And the upcoming
test is not the first New Hampshire
primary in which Nixon has had to
rely on write-in votes; he also was

 

pushed in a write-in campaign in the
1956 New Hampshire primary.

It all adds up to the fact that Nixon
is, almost unbelievably, in great shape
and could win the nomination if he
plays his cards well. He has been do-
ing just that in a series of speeches
that make the other GOP candidates
look like inepts, and it’s no more than
could be expected from the man who
almost beat Kennedy in 1960 and who
is now probably the best of our na-
tional campaigners.

This despite the fact that in a “nor-
mal” presidential year Dick Nixon
wouldn’t draw any attention to speak
of. As a two-time loser, perhaps he
could count himself lucky if he land-
ed a job helping Ike once again and
they worked together as_ television
commentators for the national con-
ventions.

But nobody is taking Goldwater and
Rocky seriously, and nobody will un-
less one of them comes out of the
primaries with a bag full of victories.
Of Nixon’s fellow noncandidates, the
most serious, Scranton, may face even
greater disadvantages than Nixon
himself seemingly faces.

Scranton lacks any definite national
character, and he lacks experience in
politics and in government. He would
make a poorer showing against John-
son, as the polls show.

For these reasons, Scranton must

Journalism Department Presents
1949 Flaherty Film Classic

By BOB MOTTLEY
The Department of Journalism is
presenting Robert Flaherty’s Louis-
iana Story Monday, March 2, at 7:30
p.m. in Payne Hall.
This is one of the

best American
films ever produc-
ed; it describes

the life of a Cajun
family in the bay-
ous of Louisiana
through unobtru-
sive and_ poet-
ic photography.
Made in _ 1949,
this film has be-
come a major
classic in its gen-
re; Virgil Thompson composed for its
soundtrack the finest original score
for any American movie.

Locally, Kings of the Sun and
The Magnificent Seven are show-
ing at the State and Lyric. The
first should be avoided unless one
can enjoy (at this stage of his
maturity) a particularly inept re-
tread of the swords & shields &
frigid princess syndrome. The
second is an old friend to most of

Mottley

 

us, a truly thrilling Western by
John Sturges.

In Roanoke, Cleopatra has finally
arrived at $1.25 a head. For those
so inclined to drive 52 miles to
see it, it has been cut to a running
time of three hours and thirty-
nine minutes—approximately the
length of Gone With the Wind. No
further comparison is possible. One
is aware in only a few scenes that
$40 million was spent on this pic-
ture; Harrison as Caesar is superb,
Burton and Taylor looks as if they
would rather be somewhere else, Not
recommended,

Phaedra Condemned

Phaedra, a brilliant retelling of
the ancient legend in modern terms,
has been soundly condemned by the
League of National Decency—and so
can be infallibly counted on to be
a box office smash. Love Yith the
Proper Stranger is a surprisingly
good Hollywood approximation of
The L-Shaped Room—with Steve
McQueen and Natalie Wood as prin-
cipals and New York City as a bril-
liant backdrop, This is expected at
the State in mid-March.
 

 

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Varsity to Play Alumni;
Fohs, Gummey Return

By JOHNNY GRAHAM
Friday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee’s first football weekend of 1964
gets underway tomorrow at 2:30 on Wilson practice field.

The varsity football squad,

which has been working out

since February 12, takes on a tough alumni team in the third

renewal of the annual varsity-alum-*
ni rivalry.

The record stands at 1-0-1 in favor
of the varsity. Last year’s game was
a 28-0 rout. The teams tied 8-8
in 1962. Before that time, the spring
game was an intrasquad affair.

Coach Mac has still not decided
upon the starting team, but prom-
ises that everyone will see action.

The alumni team is coached by
law student Bob Payne, a 1963 grad-
uate, and boasts 11 returning alum-
ni to go with 13 seniors from the
1963 team.

Two Little All-Americans will
spark the alumni’s ranks, as well
as seven members of the 1961 un-
defeated, untied team. Terry Fohs,
a linebacker, and Charlie Gummey,
a 215-pound halfback, are the Little
All-American returnees.

Seniors from the 1961 team in ad-
dition to Fohs are center Jerry
Hyatt, quarterback Robin Wood,
halfbacks Jim Hickey, a 9.7 100-yard
dash man, 215-pound Dave Tharp
and Richard Mosby, and tackle Tom
Budd.

The two captains from the once-
tied 1960 team will also be back.
They are Bobby Funkhouser, now a
coach at Collegiate School in Rich-
mond, and center Courtney Mauzy.

Payne, who will play tackle in
addition to his coaching duties, is
assisted by Raymond Raedy, a law
student from Notre Dame. Raedy will
handle the defense.

Seniors from last year’s squad
include ends Buck Ogilvie, John
Madison and Mike Jenkins, tackles
Bob Henley and Jimmie Sylvester,
guards Bill Gossman, Bill Angel and
Steve Davenport, centers Mike Shef-
fey and Dan Flournoy, quarterback
A. J. Barranco, and halfbacks Henry
Sackett and Stuart Yoffe.

Coach Mac looks for a personal
duel developing between Yoffe and
Bill David, whom he calls “as fine a
pass receiver as W&L has ever had.”
Yoffe has sworn to guard David
man-for-man.

Quite a game is in store, says
Payne. “We're short on conditioning
but long on experience, talent and
desire. We also have added some
new wrinkles to the Go-T in order
to take advantage of our speed and
size in the backfield.”

The game promises to be a fitting
kickoff for the Generals’ 1964 season.

Riflemen Shoot
In NRA Meet

With three losses this week be-
hind it, the Washington and Lee
Rifle team shoots tomorrow at Fort
Lee in the National Rifle Associa-
tion Sectionals.

Six schools, including favored
VMI and VPI, will shoot in the
N.R.A. meet. With Virginia, William
and Mary, and Richmond the rest of
the opposition, Coach Jim McSheffrey
feels the Generals have a _ good
chance of finishing third.

The riflemen lost matches held
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
after beating George Washington last
week. In the Wednesday match the
team lost to the VMI Air Force
ROTC by only two points, 1383-1381.

In that match Harold Head set
a new school record from the
kneeling position, shooting a 97 of
a possible 100, with two perfect
bullseyes. Harold Klick shot high
total, a 280 for prone, kneeling, and
standing combined.

Earlier in the week, Klick and
John Mynnttien had tied the school
record for the prone position, with
scores of 100-8x.

The N.R.A. meet will include
both individual competition and a
four-man team event. All schools

 

will enter both a varsity and an
R.O.T.C. team.

Selection for the All-State and
All-America rifle teams will be

 

based on | Per formance in this meet. !

Young Defense

e J

Spells ‘Maybe

By BRUCE GARRETT
Friday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee lacrosse pros-
pects are the best ever—maybe.

So far defense is Coach Bob Mc-
Henry’s only apparent worry on
an otherwise solid team. Bill Goss-
man is the sole returning defensive
letterman.

W&L faces its usual tough sche-
dule this year and has added two
new teams, Williams and Villanova.
McHenry sees Virginia, Williams
and Washington (Mo.) as the three
hardest games on the schedule.

The Generals open their regular
season March 26 at home against
Williams. Two days before, Swarth-
more will be here for a full-scale,
preseason scrimmage.

The attack positions are manned
by veterans Carroll Klingelhofer,
Randy Wootton, and Mike Michaeles.
The midfield has three returning let-
termen in John McDaniel, Syd But-
ler, and Jay Bowersox. Goalie Pete
Noonan is a two-year veteran.

McHenry also sees excellent fresh-
man prospects in Duncan Lamont
on attack, Bob Frost and Bob Os-
troff in the midfield, and Lance Ben-
dann and Teddy Leach at defence.

One of the unknowns of _ this
year’s team will be depth. It is still
uncertain whether the reserves and
freshmen can come through in the
way necessary for a winning sea-
son.

All in all it appears that Mc-
Henry has a team which is more
solid in both talent and experience
than any other in recent W&L his-
tory. It should make a _ significant
improvement over last year’s 3-7
record.

The Generals’ attack game will
still be nothing to rave about, but
should be a vast improvement over
recent seasons. The midfield appears
both strong and experienced enough
to more than competently carry its
share.

Season prospects—an improved
team with an mproved record, which
means a bit better than .500.

The Schedule: March 26, Williams; | ¥

March 28, at Hofstra; April 11, at
Duke; April 18, Villanova; April
25, North Carolina; May 1, Wash-
ington (Mo.); May 7, at Loyola
(Baltimore); May 9, Towson; May
14, Virginia.

SAE has captured the school basket-
ball championship, while KA’s
vaunted handball team fell before
Beta to throw that sport into a
three-way tie.

As the basketball season drew to
a close last night, SAE, as expected,
proved their supremacy, though not
without a scare.

PiKA’s Joe Framptom and Bob
Stauffer teamed up to lead PiKA to
a 21-19 halftime lead. Midway
through the second half the school
champ, for the second consecutive
year, came on to take the lead and
eventually win, 50-44.

For SAE it was their seventh
straight victory this year. Beta
captured second place on Randy
Offutt’s twisting layup with 15
seconds remaining in last night's
game against Sigma Nu. Beta won
46-44 to extend their record to 6-1.

In other tournament games played
this week and last, SAE beat Sigma
Nu 32-22, and Beta 41-32. Sigma
Nu ran away from PiKA 69-39, and
Beta did the same, 43-23. The best:
1. SAE, 7-0; 2. Beta, 6-1; 3. Sigma
Nu, 5-2; 4. PiKA, 4-3; 5. Delt, 3-1.

‘Matmen to Meet Old Foe,
Wrestle Cavaliers in Finale

By LES GRANDIS
Assistant Sports Editor

the year, the General wrestlers

are assured of another winning season.
The team takes its 6-4-1 record to Charlottesville to meet

team Saturday night.
* The Generals are hoping to avenge
their disappointing 19-8 showing
against virtually the same team last
year. Then the closest match was be-
tween 157-pounder Pete Winfield and
Alex Wells. Winfield is hoping for a
reversal of last year’s 2-1 decision.

The Cavaliers will be hurt by the
loss of their captain Jeff Boehm, who
will miss the rest of the season be-
cause of an illness, and Lance
Schaeffer at 177, because of a leg
injury.

Cavaliers Have Slumped

After a fast start, Coach Meb
Turner’s Virginia wrestlers have
been in a slump since their semes-
ter break, winning only one of their
last three matches.

W&L captain Herb Smith, who
wrestles at 167, will lead the Gen-

team. Also wrestling tomorrow will
be Butch West (123), Dick Musick
(130), Kemble White (137), Graeme
Bannerman (147), Winfield (157),
Warren Stewart (177) and Dick
Daesner (heavyweight).

The probable starters for the Wa-
hoos are Peyton McCrary (123),
Hal Clark (130), Bill Patten (137),
Dick Tucker (147), Wells (157),

3 Gary Stewart (167), older brother of

W&L wrestler Warren Stewart, Jim
Meighen (177), and Bob Bokelman
(heavywegiht).

Thus far the Cavaliers have had
a good season and the only school
against which both teams wrestled,
North Carolina State, was too pow-
erful for either.

With the national championships
almost a month away, Coach Dick
Miller doesn’t expect any Generals
to want to go. It would require a
month of hard work after a long
season, at a time when many boys
would be interested in spring sports.

 

Twombly Hedges On Job

Washington and Lee Athletic Di-
rector E. P. “Cy” Twombly said

the coaching position to be vacated

He said that, contrary to rumors,
no decision had been reached as to
McHenry’s possible successor. Al-
though quite a number of applica-
tions have been received, no inter-
views have as yet been given.

by Tim OKeefe

Cassius Clay has always claimed

he would “upset the world,” and
Tuesday night he did just that.
There have been charges that the
fight was fixed, but these grumblings
can probably be dismissed as only
inane comments from disgruntled
Liston supporters. Liston’s legend
of invincibility is forever shattered.

In the sports pages of the daily
Papers, most columnists and writ-
ers are falling all over themselves
trying to find out where they were
wrong in picking Liston.

In__ pre-fight = articles, there
wasn’t a single sports editor who
gave Clay a chance. Liston will
murder him in three, they said—at
least by the sixth.

But everyone was forgetting Cas-
sius Clay and what he had been
rather loudly saying. Clay had pick-
ed round eight to make him great.
Instead it was round seven which
sent him to heaven.

Many have been wondering about
Liston’s shoulder injury. The con-
sensus is that Liston could not have
hurt it in the first round, as he
claims, and still do as good a job
as he did. Still, this isn’t saying
much. Liston missed more punches
in that fight than most fighters do
in a career.

It did take some of the glamor
away to find that Clay did win be-
cause of Liston’s shoulder injury.
Until the seventh round both fight-
ers were tied according to the offi-
cials’ score cards, and the way things
were going, it probably wouldn’t
have been much longer before Clay
ran away with the fight.

Liston seemed like a big, clum-
sy bear chasing a youthful, taunt-
ing opponent. If Clay couldn’t see
during most of the fifth round, as
he claims, and if Liston was pour-
ing out everything he had—let’s
face it. The man with the loud
mouth did just as he said he was
going to do. He made a lot of
wild claims and backed up every
one of them.

It didn’t turn out to be a lion-
eat-Christian affair as a few mem-
bers of the campus press had
feared it would. Nor did this mem-
orable piece of journalistic non-
sense come about: “Without at-
tempting rash _ predictions, we
would not be at all surprised if
Cassius Clay were killed in the
first round... the fighters are not
trained well enough... they don’t
know how to defend them-
selves...it just isn’t worth it.”

In the handball tournament there
was no such clear-cut decision. No
fewer than three of the four league
champions tied for the top spot with
2-1 tournament records.

Beta, Delt, and surprising KA all
came up with identical marks. PiKA,
meanwhile, lost all three matches.

It all came about this way. Delt
beat Beta, 4-1; KA then beat Delt,
4-1, making KA the favorite; then
Beta came back and upset KA, 3-2.
Meanwhile, KA and Beta were both
downing PiKA. And then last night
Delt downed PiKA throwing the
tournament into a three-way tie.

now has absolutely nothing to lose.
If Scranton really doesn’t want to be
president, as he claims, then he will
continue to ignore his backers until
it is too late. In that case, Nixon will
have to be the favorite to try one
more time for the Grand Old Party.

whom was instrumental in two
Washington and Lee victories, the
W&L freshman swimming team
easily downed Lynchburg’s frosh

Houston won both the 100 and 50-
yard freestyle events with his best
times this year, while Chittum, after
swimming a stint with the winning
W&L medley relay team, copped a
first place in the 200-yard breast-

Just 28 Pounds of Breathtaking Performance!

No portable phonograph ever played like this before. The
KLH Model Eleven rivals consoles at twice the price, and
weighs far less than any other portable of any pretension
to quality. Each componené@sis the finest ever used in a
portable. Heart of the system is a pair of revolutionary
long-excursion speakers, coupled with a powerful solid-
state amplifier whose output is shaped to match their bass
power requirements so that their response curve remains
flat far below its natural roll-off. Together, they make
possible the astonishing clarity, range and power of the
KLH Model Eleven — the world’s first respectable portable.

A well planned wardrobe is the only real guarantee of a well-
dressed appearance. A common mistake made by young men is to
buy clothes that attract them without considering how they’ll fit
in with the clothes they already own. ‘Wardrobe buying” doesn’t
mean bankrupting yourself buying matched sets of everything at
once, but the suits, shirts, ties, shoes and hats you buy this Fall
must coordinate and complement each other. Let’s take a look at
your new wardrobe for Fall.

NATURAL SHOULDER, NATURALLY—

The natural shoulder silhouette remains
the outstanding fashion favorite among
young men this Fall, cut on straight-hang-
ing lines, with center-vented jackcts,
flapped pockets and narrow, medium
length lapels. Generally they’ll be seen in
three button models, but the influence of
vigahrous New Frontier styling has oc-
casioned some trend toward two button
jackets. Trousers are tapered and pleat-
less.

THE RISING HAIRLINE... isn’t a per-

sonal grooming problem you have to face
yet, but an indication of the big rise in
popularity for hairline stripings in young
men’s suits this Fall. You’ll see them
against every color background, but par-
ticularly gray. Gray, seen in a wide range
of tones from light chalky grays to dark
combinations with blue, black and olive,
is the fashion-first color in natural shoul-
der tailored apparel this Fall. Of course,
the blue suit is always with us, and a good
bet for your basic dress-up suit is a dark
blue or blue-gray worsted. And, in both
blues and grays, fashion excitement for’
Fall is generated by large muted glen
plaids. Blues, grays and olives all get to-
gether in new olive and olive-blue casts in
all-wool, worsted and polyester blended
fibers.

SEMI-DRESS STRIPES ... describes the
wide range of big wide stripes in dress
shirts this Fall. These stripes, for high-
interest contrast with your solid color
suits, are bigger and wider than ever, and
fit into the semi-dress, less-than-big-date
category. Red and white is the front-run-
ning favorite, but check out the wide blue
and white and olive and white combina-
tions, Definitely dressier are the plain
white and solid color oxfords in soft
shades to coordinate with the new hair-
line stripes. Widespread collars won’t go
with your natural shoulder suit. Choose
a medium spread button-down or a snap-
tab collar.

TIEING THE KNOT. ..on your fashion package doesn’t simply end
with matching neckwear colors to your suit. Not only color, but
pattern must be balanced with your suit and shirt. Natural shoulder
styling calls for regimental neckwear, and regimental stripes are
getting bolder and bigger to match new wide stripings on shirts.
For a change of pace, and still in step with your natural shoulder
suits, take a look at the muted dark tones in new printed figures on
silk foulard or wool challis ties.

FROM THE GROUND UP ... is the way to build anything, includ-

ing a well-dressed appearance. To coordinate with all your natu-
rally tailored apparel, your basic shoe wardrobe should include a
pair of dark red-brown cordovans or cordovan color calfskin laced-
fronts, and a pair of black slip-ons or laced-front models in either
plain toe or moccasin design. Stick to plain ribbed socks in matching
and coordinating colors.

TOPPING IT OFF ...is best done with a hat, not with a wild thatch

of wind-blown hair. You'll complete the slim, natural look of your
wardrobe with a narrow, snap-brim hat, underscored slightly by a
tapered crown. And you'll find both raw edged brims and welt
edges on the newest headwear. Both gray-brown and olive with
black bands will coordinate with your new gray or olive natural
shoulder suit.

OUTERWEAR, FORIAAL ViEAR, SKI WEAR... and much more

.are all coming up in the months ahead. Outerwear next time.
See you then.
