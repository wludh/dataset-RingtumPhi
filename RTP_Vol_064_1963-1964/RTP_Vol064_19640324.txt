Dr. Fiedler
Speaks Here
Tomorrow

One of Montana State Universi-
ty’s leading professors will speak
here tomorrow, Wednesday, March
25:

Leslie A. Fiedler, professor of
English Literature and Director of
Humanities, will lecture on “The!
Image of the Negro and Indian in}
American Literature” at 8 p.m. in|
duPont Auditorium.

 

His appearance, sponsored by the}
English Department and Seminars
in Literature, was arranged by the
University Center in Virginia.

The Seminars in Literature, found-
ed in 1952, bring to the campus
outstanding figures in the field of
creative writing, criticism, and
teaching.

Dr. Fiedler received his B.A. de-
gree from New York University,
and his M.A. and Ph.D. from the
University of Wisconsin. He did
post-doctoral work at Harvard and
was a student at the Japanese Lan-
guage School (University of Colo- |
rado).

A member of Montana State Uni-
versity’s staff since 1941, Dr. Fiedler
served a two-year term as Chair-
man of the English Department and
has been Director of the Humanities
Course since 1948. During leaves he
has taught at the Universities of
Bologna, Rome, Venice, Athens, and
Princeton.

He has held a Rockefeller Follow-
ship, two Fulbright Fellowships, the
Kenyon Review Fellowship in Criti-
cisms and the Christian Gauss Fel-
lowship at Princeton University in
1956.

He has been awarded the Furioso
Poetry Prize and the award from the
National Institute of Arts and Let-
ters for “excellence in creative writ-
ing.”

Along with contributing to many
periodicals, he is the author of An
End to Innocence: Essays on Culture
and Politics, The Art of the Essay,
and Love and Death in the American
Novel.

UCA Initiates
Committee For

Social Affairs

Under the auspices of the Univer-
sity Christian Association, the UCA
Committee for Christian Social Con-
cerns was recently established and
organized. On Thursday, March 12,
it held its first meeting with Bob
Potts as chairman.

The committee, consisting of 25
members, was organized to become
better acquainted with social and
racial problems encountered in the
local area, especially in Lexington
itself. Further plans call for its
participation in community efforts
such as the aiding of the Lexing-
ton Voters League.

The committee was the brainchild
of several students who attended a
conference at Haverford Collegge a
month ago. At that conference they
came in contact with members of
similargroups from campuses
throughout the East. Most of the
sucommittees aided in local activi-
ties, but others, such as at the
University of Virginia, picketted
on their own initiative a segregated
restaurant,

Upon their return to W&L, it was
decided to form a cimilar, but smal-
lerand more moderate group that
would primarily observe local prob-
lems and participate in local action.
Dr. Louis Hodges carefully pointed
out that this committee would not
initiate any boycotts nor agitate for
integration of Washington and Lee.

The committee is helping with the
current voter registration drive. To-
night and Thursday there will be
workshops in the Lexington Town
Hall to train interested students and
townsfolk. Dr. Louis Hodges will
lead one workshop.

‘Every Student A Participant’

 

Editor’s Note: The following is
a statement by the Steering Com-
mittee of the Mock Convention,

Since last June, the state chair-
men and members of the steering
committee have been laying the
groundwork for the Washington and
Lee Mock Republican Convention.
To ensure that sufficient preparation
is being made, they have contacted
politicians in Washington, party
workers all over the country, pro-
fessional parade planners, and
friends of W&L in many areas and
professions.

This work has proven to be very
fruitful, and the convention up to
this point is a success. Whether or
not this will continue, whether the
convention will maintain its fine rec-
ord of accuracy over the past half-

century, depends on the individual!

efforts of each student who will
now be asked to give of his time
and enthusiasm in the final prepara-
tion for the convention and in the
two days it is held. What the Mock
Convention will mean to every stu-
dent depends on this same thing: the
cooperation each student contrib-
utes.

It is perhaps difficult to realize
the feeling of esteem in which our
Mock Convention is held in po-
litical circles. Politicians actually
do follow W&L’s Mock Conven-
tion with keen interest. Its guest
list is long and distinguished, and
it is good evidence of the fact
That the Republican Party is
watching the convention,

No other Mock Convention can
boast of a comparable group
guests—including congressmen, par-
ty officials, the keynote speaker of
the last Republican National Con-
vention, and the beauty queens of
several states. The news media also
hold the convention in high regard;
it has received national magazine
and television coverage in the past
and the steering committee has high
hopes of expanding this coverage
this year.

The highest compliment paid
to the Mock Convention to date
may have come from James Wells,
Gov. Rockefeller’s New York
chairman, when he said that the
Washington and Lee Mock Con-
vention was the third most impor-
tant victory needed by Rockefeller,
following two state primaries.

Every student of the University
is in some way a participant in
the convention. Assistant chairmen,
secretaries, float chairmen, nomi-
nation speakers, campaign managers,
fund raisers, clerks and many other
capacities are needed to produce the
magnificent show that the conven-
tion will be. Besides these specific
jobs, each student is asked to become
a political analyst, to keep abreast of
the news, to take issue wtih the ex-
perts in expression of his own
opinion,

 

Mock Convention Is Assessed |

The 53-state and territory dele-
gations will hold meetings to dis-
cuss the field of candidates and
their varying strengths, and every
member of the delegations must
help his state arrive at a correct
stand if the convention’s accuracy
is to continue. It is not the job
of the state chairman to determine
alone how his state will vote—this
is the privilege of his delegation
to determine.

Each student is also asked to
serve in public relations, to publi-
cize the convention by telling his

 

 

parents friends, and anyone in the
news media to whom he may
have access. In sum, the students are
being asked to give their best indi-
vidiual talents in particular tasks.
The colorfulness of a state delega-
tion, the originality of a float, the
convention rallies and the balloting,
all hinge on the efforts and the
enthusiasm of the delegation mem-
bers.

In these contributions, the light
side of the Mock Convention will
also be brought out. The Parade

Examination Schedule
May 23, 1964 through June 2, 1964

It is the responsibilty of each student to know the time and place of
meeting of each of his examinations. The hours for examinations are 9:00-
12:00 and 2:00-5:00. Any student more than five minutes late must present
a satisfactory reason for his lateness to be allowed to take the examina-

tion.

The omission by a student of any regular examination causes him to for-
feit his place in the class and to receive grade F for the semester, unless he
is excused for reasons deemed sufficient by the Dean and instructor con-

C. W. Turner

To Publish Text

On Western U.S.

Dr. Charles W. Turner, Professor
of History at Washington and Lee,
recently submitted his manuscript
of a new history text to Garrett
and Masey Publishers in Richmond.

The text is designed for college
studying western United

courses
States in the 19th and 20th cen-

turies. Throughout the book, Dr.
Turner keeps sight of the Webb and
Turner theses of the development of

the West, and points out valuable
criticism relative to both.

Scheduled to be published in the

fall, the new text will consist of
approximately 450 pages and 34
chapters. The Western life during
these times include the American
land policy, conservation, oil, rail-
roads, the new states of Hawaii and
Alaska, the Civil War in the West,
the Indians, and the gold rush.
Dr. Turner started his research in
1954 at the University of Minnesota
and received several Glenn Grants
which permitted him to spend a few
summers at the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley.

Other works of Dr. Turner in-
clude Chessie’s Road, the story of

the Chesapeake and Ohio, and 40
articles printed by various journals

such as American Economic History
and The Journal of Southern His-
tory.

Rod Cockshutt
To Lead JFK
Library Group

 

Rod Cockshutt, a senior here, has
been chosen chairman of the Ken-
nedy Library Committee to direct
the drive on this campus for a

memorial library to the late presi-
dent.

The proposed $10 million library
will be constructed in Boston. The
national committee will coordinate
drives in late April on 2,100 campus-
es throughout the nation as their
part in the public campaign to raise
the necessary funds.

According to the Corporation an-
nouncement, the Institute of the
Library will further one of Presi-
dent Kennedy’s deepest concerns—
his continuing attempt to bring to-
gether the world of ideas and the
world of affairs; the world of schol-
arship and the world of decision.

Program of Institute

The Institute will strive to bring
intellectual and public affairs closer
together in a diversity of ways—
through lectures and seminars by
professors, politicians and _ public
servants of all parties and from
foreign countries; through profes-
sional chairs; through meeting
rooms for undergradutes interested
in politics and public affairs; through
fellowships for scholars, American
and foreign; through visitors-in-
residence; through organization of
study groups and_ conferences
bringing together scholars and prac-
titioners to consider vital issues;
through a publication program;
through literary and public service
awards; and through a variety of
other means.

Any students interested in par-
ticipating in this drive should con-

tact Rod Cockshutt at HO 3-2335, or
| at Post Office Box 311.

*ing committee for the wekend, and
he has selected the name “Con-
tact” for the event. Contact will be
for the benefit of all Washington
and Lee students, and will be a
result of close cooperation between
the Faculty, the Administration, and
the student leaders of the program.

Brownell, a junior Kappa Sig from
Birmingham, Ala. is currently chair-
man of the Alabama Delegation of
the Mock Convention. He is a
Dean’s List student, a Robert E.
Lee Research Scholar, an officer in
his fraternity, and he plays bass
guitar for Sabers and Sensations
combo.

Quekemeyer To Assist

Henry Quekemeyer, a Delt from
Roanoke, Va., has ben appointed
assistant chairman of Contact. A
freshman, Phil Claxton, has been
appointed special assistant to Brown-
ell. Quekemeyer is an Honor Roll
student, a dorm counselor, and an
officer in his fraternity.

The theme chosen for the first
Contact is The American Experience,
and Its Implications for the Indi-
vidual Citizen, the American Na-
tion, and the World. The elaboration
of such a broad topic can be made
along historical, political, economic,
sociological, religious, and scienti-
fic lines.

Broad Scope Intentional

The purpose of Contact is to offer
varying viewpoints and approaches
to an overall intellectual problem.
It is felt that the proposed theme
will offer the widest possible appeal
to all members of the student body
and surrounding colleges, both in its
particular aspects and from the
standpoint of the conference as a
whole.

The tentative plans for the Con-
ference are for a series of lectures
and seminars conducted by a num-
ber of outstanding speakers. The
Chairman has expressed a desire to
get half of the speakers from the
ranks of those who are nationally
known, and even controversial. The
other half he hopes to take from
the ranks of those that are lesser
known popularly but are experts
in their respective fields.

The advantage of such an exten-
sive program of lectures and semi-
nars of this type, all directed to-
ward a certain unity, is that it is
more impressive and more valuable
than numerous unconnected indi-
vidual lectures.

Financing of Weekend

The Conference will largely be
financed through national corpora-
tions, national foundations, interest-
ed individuals, and possible aid
from the Faculty Committee on Lec-
tures by their coordinating of sev-
eral of their speakers with the Con-
ference weekend.

Anyone wishing to apply for a po-
sition on the staff of the Conference,
and any one wishing to contribute
suggestions about the Conference,
may address their letters to Blaine
Brownwell, P. O. Box 6.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Tuesday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

Trash —Unexpurgated!

Filth, anyone?

Erotic smut scenes, replete with vivid drawings of
copulation, oral-genital contact, and every imaginable il-
lustration of the instruments of l’amour?

Pornographic poetry, chock full of all your favorite
four letter words, describing in lucid detail everything
bodily from orgasms to bowel movements?

You needn’t look far—it’s all right here on campus.

And we aren’t talking about the latest issue of The
Southern Collegian or a Ring-tum Phi feature—both of
which have come under fire recently for their “porno-
graphic” content.

No. We’re talking about the dazzling doodles that
decorate half the desks at W&L.

Futhermore, we don’t think it’s funny—but we do
think it’s ironic, considering the recent comments about
the college humor magazine and a particular article in the
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi.

We should like to suggest that a situation meriting
much greater attention is the asinine artistry that seems
to be a favorite pastime of some members of the stu-
dent body. We know of classrooms in Howe Hall, Rob-
inson, and Newcomb, at least, where desks have been
covered with every describable kind of lewdness.

None of these are the least bit witty or amusing—
they’re just dirty, in the same way that bathroom writings
of little boys are dirty.

We wonder why Washington and Lee gentlemen
would waste their time and minds committing such smut
to posterity. We shudder to think of the reaction of par-
ents, guests, or dates who, visiting a lecture, happen to
glance down and fine huge reproductions of the sex
organs staring them in the face. We’re sure their impres-
sions of Washington and Lee would be altered consider-
ably.

Perhaps the reason the University has not rectified
the situation is that it would be a losing battle—as soon
as one desk was refinished, three more defaced ones might
appear. If this is the case, then it really is too bad—and
things are a lot sorrier than we thought.

The situation really should be a matter of student re-
sponsibility. The thought of administrative paternalism
slapping the hands of nasty little boys is unpleasant; stu-
dents should take enough pride in Washington and Lee
to see that the artisans under discussion are turned into
the Student Control Committee and duly dealt with.

What would the SCC do in such a case? We don’t
know; to our knowledge, no one has ever been turned in
for “classroom pornography.” But we think they should
be.

At any rate, some of the attention directed toward The
Southern Collegian might be put to better use in this
area—a problem which even high schools shouldn’t have
to confront, let alone universities full of honorable men.

Search for Communication
Basic Antonioni Theme

By TOM PACE

The Night—directed and written by Michelangelo Antonioni. With
Jeanne Moreau, Marcello Mastroianna, and Monica Vitti. At the
Lyric, tonight. ee
The Night is the second part of the Antonioni trilogy;

a trilogy concerned with modern man’s inability to love, to com-

municate, to feel. Antonioni has become one of the two or three most

important directors alive. He deals with this inner struggle—a strug-
gle which, admittedly, some have dealt with before—in a manner
which is original; and which is provoking and exciting.

Marcello Mastroianni plays a writer who has just published

a successful book. Jeanne Moreau plays his wife. The film begins

with them visiting a close friend in the hospital who is about to

die. Mastroianni tries to amuse him, to humor him, to keep his
spirits up. Moreau cannot stand staying there. She leaves, goes
outside, and cries. The foundation is laid. Mastroianni feels he
can no longer write. He is almost completely isolated. Once a young
man who would have killed himself if he could not have written, he
finds himself ready to compromise with what he despises; with the
society which is controlled by industrialists. He feels he has failed.

Moreau feels his failure. And she loses her convictions too. She is

unable to devote herself to her husband, and unable to love him.

Without this devotion, he is bored with her.

A Day and a Night
But Antonioni is not satisfied with letting them come to this
knowledge, and then leaving them. He has already done that in

L’Avventura. In The Night his characters are unwilling to accept

their situation. The film is concerned with one day and one night

in these people's lives. Antonioni uses this time to show them coming
to an awareness of their circumstances, followed by a refusal to
submit to them, followed by more realization, and finally by an at-
tempt to rekindle their old love.

With Antonioni as with other great directors of the cinema, it
is his method which makes him unusual. Antonioni is able to create
and maintain a mood that is perfect for his subject. His treatment
is slow, eareful, and melancholy. This mood is interrupted very
few times; when it is, it is to show those few moments in which
life is really life, not a living death as it has become. Certain scenes
illustrate this technique so excellently that they deserve detailed
discussion.

 

Seach for Communication
Early in the film Jeanne Moreau goes for a walk. She is tired
and bored, feeling very badly about the visit in the hospital. This
walk is an attempt to rediscover her sympathies, to revitalize
her feelings. During the walk she encounters two men, drunk and
laughing and talking with each other. She laughs with them—not

Last Week: The theory was ad-
vanced that Ernest Hemingway, in
committing suicide, was unable to
stand by his own code of “holding
tight” against bad odds—the very
code which Hemingway himself had
enforced in the characters of his
greatest heroes. A few more ex-
amples are included in this con-
cluding article.

Frederick Henry, hero of Farewell
to Arms, met Catherine Barclay at
a time when he was trying to keep
himself aloof from the world—he
wanted to remain on the perimeter
of life, to avoid becoming involved
emotionally in it. But he discovered
a receptive outlet for his love in
Catherine, and became absolutely
devoted to her—his life was centered
upon her survival: “Dear God, don’t
let her die. Please please, please
dear God, don’t let her die.”

The World Breaks Everyone

Running parallel to Henry’s de-
votion to Catherine is the novel’s
theory that the world breaks every-
one, “and afterward many are strong
at the broken places.” When Cath-
erine died, Frederick Henry was a
broken man, but we are left with
the idea that the broken pieces will
become strong again. Henry will
return to America and live his life
much as Jake Barnes lived his. He
will never love another woman
again, at least not as he loved Cath-

erine, and in this sense Henry is a
lot like Jake Barnes.

A far different character from
either Henry or Barnes is Robert
Jordan, hero of For Whom the Bell
Tolls, whom E. B. Burgum has
called “the only character of Hem-
ingway’s creation whom he treats
with unreserved affection and ad-
miration.” From one point of view,
Jordan is the most admirable of
Hemingway’s heroes: he is strong,
handsome, world-wise, dedicated,
courageous, intelligent, and capable
of fulfilling his orders.

Robert Jordan's Idealism

Jordan is an idealist, and he loses
his life trying to stand by that ideal.
In the face of impossible odds, and
with the knowledge that the failure
to retreat would mean certain death,
Jordan maintained his belief that if
the loss of his life in any way de-
tained the advance of the Fascists,
then it was worth the sacrifice. In a
sense, then, Jordan was the great-
est code hero of them all for he was
not merely living out his life under
unsatisfactory conditions, but was
giving it up for the code.

Nick Adams in the short story,
“Big Two-Hearted River,” went on
a fishing trip to help himself forget
what had happen to him during the
war. Most of the story is devoted to
detailed descriptions of how Nick
sets up his camp, the food which he

eee

eats, and how he collects grasshop-
pers early in the morning before the
dew evaporates.

Ritual of Nick Adams

The emotions which Nick feels are
intense—he eats slowly so he can
enjoy his food; he waits a bit for
the spaghetti and beans to cool so
he won’t burn his tongue. He, like
Jake, is very meticulous and care-
ful about everything he does so that
nothing will be ruined.

The reason for Nick’s careful ac-
tions is that they are part of a heal-
ing process for him—they bring a
sense of order to his life, an order
which has gone since he has ex-
perienced the brutality and stupidity
of war. Fishing was Nick’s healing
agent.

The Good Place

But Ernest Hemingway had gotten
too old to be able to participate in
these actions which were his healing
agents. For after all, Hemingway
was Frederick Henry, Jake Barnes,
Robert Jordan, and Nick Adams.
Jake Barnes, the insomniac, had slept
very well on the banks of the river
after he had caught six fish; this
was because he was in “the good
place.” Hemingway, as an old man,
could no longer go there.

It is possible that Hemingway, in
the middle of his last novel, took a
long look at himself and at the novel.

The Revolution of ’63

 

Segregation Weak Economically

Editor’s Note: This is the con-
cluding article in a series which
was originally published in the
Waynesboro News-Virginian.

By LOUIS W. HODGES

Desegregation is coming. The
forces which will make our racial
policies are already at work. The
events of last summer are but signs
of the presence of
such forces.
_ The obvious in-
fluences leading
_ toward a_ more
" sane society are
. likely not the im-
portant ones.
The  demonstra-
tions, the bomb-
ings, the resolu-
tions, the court
— ' decisions — these
os. ong things are but the
surface signs that a revolution is on.

Desegregation will come, but not
because men resolve to make a bet-
ter world. Discrimination against the
Negro will cease, but not out of
goodness and high principle. Nor will
discrimination stop because men
are influenced deeply by rational

  
   
   

argument or by such articles as
this series has been. Men will de-
segregate because it will increasing-
ly become economic necessity—be-
cause we cannot afford not to!

Economics Demand Integration

Industry and all sound economic
systems recognize the necessity to
provide the best products possible
with the least expenditure. This de-
mands that industry employ the
best executive, staff, and labor avail-
able, whatever their racial back-
ground. The recognition of this will
increasingly motivate the Negro to
seek education and training.

The Negro’s more insistent de-
mand will apply greater pressure to
educational institutions to deseg-
regate, to admit the student most
able to earn regardless of race. The
white will come to know the Negro
as never before, that is, as an equal,
and will gradually abandon the
mythical fear of the Negro as a
race—this fear being the real root
of prejudice. (Incidentally, we do
not hold prejudice against the in-
dividual Negro, only against the
“Negro Race.” Here we have our

bogey man—an abstraction, like all
bogey men have to be.)
Change Comes Slowly

The professional reformer of so-
ciety is not happy with this slow
process. He wants immediate change.
Yet if we are to be realists, we must
think in terms of generations rath-
er than years. The Negro children
beginning the first grade this fall
will finish high school in 1975. They
have higher hopes and reason for
stronger motivation than any other
class of Negro pupils in our history.
When they complete college in 1979
the lessons of the past will have
been learned more effectively. They
will have a solid place in our society.

The wheels of God’s time turn
slowly, but they grind exceedingly
fine. Our little social experiments
crumble, This will be the destiny
of segregation. The role of the sane
citizen for the present is to under-
stand the forces at work and to
channel them in constructive rather
than destructive directions.

One thing remains clear: desegre-
gation is coming. We are all more
aware now than we were before
“the Revolution of 63.”

Socialized Medicine: Is It Really a Success?
Are Foreign Countries Satisfied With It?

By WYATT B. DURRETTE

That the system of medical care
in the U.S. is imperfect seems be-
yond doubt. But
= contra to Syd
Lewis, writing in
Friday’s R-t P, I
submit that on
balance it is su-
perior to the sys-
tems, socialist “ or
. free, in other
parts of the world.

In an array of
statistical leged-
ermain Mr. Lewis
downgrades USS.
medical performances by citing dif-
ferent countries that surpass us in
one or two areas. His logical con-
clusion should be, if anything, that
our system is not superior in every
measure to the rest of the world’s
combined. This is hardly astound-
ing.

 

Durrette

Lesson In Unreasoning

But Mr. Lewis’s logic is a side-
show worthy of special note. Follow,
if you will, this lesson in “unreason-
ing”: (1) each player on UCLA’s
NCAA basketball champs may be
inferior to one or more athletes
elsewhere in the country; ergo (2)
UCLA is not the nation’s number
one team. It is with similar analyti-
cal clarity that Mr. Lewis views U.S.
medical achievements.

However, in the introduction to
his symposium, Financing Medical
Care: An Apprasial of Foreign Pro-
grams, Dr. Helmut Schoeck, pro-
fessor of sociology at Emory Uni-
versity, writes: “The history and
performance of compulsory health
plans in other countries, as well
as the absence of major health prob-
lems in countries without national
compulsory schemes, hardly sug-
gests that this antiquated approach
to medical care is the wave of the
future....[T]he nationalization of
medical care is on the way to be-
coming a _ discredited, antiquated
idealogy.”

Finland's Health

Particularly, Finland, cited twice
by Mr. Lewis as superior to the
U.S. in two categories, has not
adopted compulsory health plans in
any form. And Switzerland, cited
once, beyond a small government
subsidy to assist a few voluntary
plans, remains committed to a volun-
tary medical system.

Writing of West Germany, cited
once, Professor Hans Schulten, for-
mer dean of the Medical School of
Cologne University, points out that,
“all our hospitals are continuously
overcrowded . . . The health system
in Germany with compulsory mem-
bership for most employed persons
offers numerous opportunities for
abuse and fraud... and is just as

wasteful of drugs as it is of doctor’s
time.”
Sweden’s Medical Headache

Dr. Alfred Zanker, correspondent
for the Neue Zurcher Zeitung, ob-
serving Sweden’s (cited once) com-
pulsory program writes, “it has fal-
len far short of its promises and
has developed unforseen complica-
tions. The first five years of com-
pulsory health insurance have re-
sulted in dangerous fiscal strain.
For many people, tax evasion has
become a matter of economic sur-
vival.

“Sweden is one welfare state
where the mask of benevolence and
generosity has already worn thin in
a relatively few years. The public
in countries which have so far
avoided the pitfalls of compulsory
health insurance would be well-
advised to take a hard second look
at the usual claims that such state
medicine will cost only pennies a
day.

“The end of 1961 found Sweden’s
medical care situation quite alarm-
ing. Publie criticism is ever more
frequent and voeal. Much attention
was paid to reports from Lund, a
university city, where forty severe-
ly ill persons—all on the waiting
lists of the overcrowded hospitals—
died before they could be admitted.”

Negotiations

With USSR
‘Only Way’

By LAMAR LAMB

In January, a General in the Air
Foree Reserve declared his candi-
dacy for the
Presidency of the
United States. He,
and a group of
loud supporters,
have declared
themselves in fa-
vor of an austre
and absolute for-
eign policy. As in
other matters, this
General / Senator
claims that a rad-
ical departure
from present policy is necessary for
the continuation of our way Of life.
He even claims to know what that
policy should be.

 

Senator Goldwater and his sup-
porters claim that to stand up to
a communist is to defeat him.
These people point with satisfac-
tion to instances where the United
States has stood resolutely on an
issue and the Soviet Union has
backed down. They then claim that
on every issue where we threaten
the Soviet Union they will back
down. Their idea of a foreign
policy is to back down the Rus-
sians with threats, and when they
won't back, then bomb them,

It is these same people who would
withdraw diplomatic recognition of
the Soviet Union. It is as if some-
how that would show that a Com-
munist system is morally repre-
hensible. The battle cry is that the
East listens to nothing but strength
and to even try to deal with them
is to suggest weakness,

Surely it is naive to think that the
second most powerful nation in the
world is going to be backed out of
existence by threats of war. The
Soviet Union, a communist nation,
exists and is strong, and as much
as we dislike it, we must deal with
them. True, the time may come when
we may have to drop bombs on
the Soviet Union, or some other
nation, in order to defend our own
way of life. But it is foolish to
think that the Soviet Union will not
use its bombs if it has to do so to
protect its way of life,

But since the Soviet Union has
gotten nuclear weapons, the na-
ture of war and its use as a threat
as a means of achieving diplomat-
ic ends has been severely limited.
Because of the unimaginable po-
tential of modern weapons, total
war is no longer a rational alter-
native if, indeed, it ever was, In
a total war, the entire world would
be the battleground, and the vic-
tors would be nonexistent. Lead-
ers of both the East and West
must realize this, and must plan
their policy accordingly.

To withdraw diplomatic recogni-
tion of your own worst enemy is
to say that there is no possible fur-
ther negotiation. And there are
those who would claim that this is
precisely the case. But we must deal
with the Soviet Union because we
have no choice. If either is to sur-
vive, then both must survive, for
to destroy one is to destroy the
other.

There is evidence that the leaders
of the Soviet Union realize this.
Their awareness of its importance to
them is shown in the ideological
split with Red China. To be sure,
they are not trying to argue that
the Soviet Union and the United
States should be allies. But they

Michaels, Bocetti Lead 1950 Gator Bowl Team

As Part Il of the Tuesday Sports series W&L’s For-
gotten Teams, we are this week featuring perhaps the
greatest General football team in the school’s history. This
is the team that produced such heroes as Walt Michaels
and Gil Bocetti, won the Southern Conference title and
went on to the post-season Gator Bowl. We have tried to
incorporate some of the spirit and glory of the bygone na-
tional recognition in this Part 1I—W&L’s Gator Bowl Foot
ball Team of 1950.

By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor
Every once in a while it is gratifying to remember the good
old days of Washington and Lee sports, big-time football in
particular. Granted, the present non-subsidization policy allows
more boys to participate and less chance for sports to dominate
academic pursuits; however, the thoughts of capacity football
crowds, national recognition, and real “hard-nosed” play with
opponents such as West Virginia, Virginia and VPI do stimu-
late fond memories.
In the fall of 1950, head football mentor, George Bar-
clay, led his vaunted Generals to an 8-2 seasonal record with

 

Walt Michaels, the “Big Train” as he was dubbed, shows why he led
the 1950 football team in rushing (712 yards) and scoring (89 points).
Notice the capacity Wilson Field crowd that came to cheer home the
Southern Conference champions.

VMI Trounces WGL, 5-0
In First Practice Scrimmage

By SKIP CHASE
Assistant Sports Editor

Yesterday afternoon the baseball nine of Coach Joe Lyles
fell victim to their cross-town rivals in a scrimmage that saw
few hits with VMI picking up most of them for a 5-0 decision.

Trying to play “balanced ball,” the Generals looked good

on defense with the exception of*

 

 

two costly errors accounting for
three unearned runs in the top of
the third inning. At the plate, how-
ever, the W&L nine could collect
only one clean hit and for the most
part were behind the pitching as an
abundance of foul balls indicated.
In Preperation for Bucknell

The purpose of the scrimmage was
to better the team’s batting timing
in preparation for Thursday’s opener
at home with Bucknell.

Co-captain Brice Gamber started
for the General staff and held the
Keydets to only one earned run
in three complete innings. Fresh-
man righthander Pete Heumanns
and his amazing curve looked good
in relief while Chris Wigert, al-
ready picked as Thursday’s starter,
saw limited action in right field. It
is worthy to note also that neither
Gamber nor Heumanns issued a
single walk in five full innings.

victories over Furman, W. Va., Citadel, Davidson, VPI, Del
aware, Louisville, and Richmond. Led by co-captains Don
Fergusson and Joe McCutcheon, All-American Walt Michaels,
and All Southern Conference selection Gil Bocetti, this Wash-
ington and Lee team rushed 2,995 yards and scored 318 points
in ten games.

Losses to Virginia, 26-21, and Tennessee, 27-20, during
the season were disappointments, but Michael’s season point
output of 89 and Bocetti’s fine passing kept the Generals unde-
feated in the Southern Conference and ranked nationally as
number two in the South. Some mention must be made of the
prodigious feats of Walt Michaels while at W&L. The “Big
Train,” as the sports writers nick-named him piled up 712 yards
rushing from his fullback position, never got stopped for a loss,
and had a final rushing average of 6.0 yards-a-carry. From the
General team, Michaels went to the professional Cleveland
Browns where he starred and was selected to All-Pro teams
several times.

Washington and Lee easily swept past its first three 1950
opponents with wins over Furman (27-6) favored West Vir-
ginia (26-7) and defensively minded Citadel (20-0.) Virginia
was the next General opponent and some long-forgotten spirit
was revived for this thirty-second meeting of these rivals. The
entire front page of the Ring-tum Phi was about the upcoming
contest, all the available seats were taken a week before the
game, and Cy Young spoke to a wild impromptu pep-rally.
However the Generals saw a 21-13 half-time lead dissolve
with U.Va.’s aerial attack and fell victim, 26-21.

Everyone got into the scoring act at Davidson (47-12) as
the Minks prepared for Tennessee, where two long punt re-
turns and an injury to quarterback Bocetti led to a 27-20 loss
to the Vols. After this second loss, the Generals settled down
to trounce VPI in the mud, 25-7, and to humiliate the Uni-
versity of Delaware, 32-0. By this time rumors were beginning
to circulate about bowl possibilities for W&L, and the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch indicated that Washington and Lee
was indeed a “fair bet” to get the bid.

An intercepted Louisville pass on their own one-yard line,
gave the Generals a close 33-28 win over the Cardinals. Lead-

‘One-Point’ Ruling Clarified

ing 20-0 at the half, W&L almost succumbed to the Louisville
passing game, but held on for the win in this wild, high-scoring
contest. With this victory and an almost assured Southern Con-
ference title (Richmond remained on the schedule), bowl ru-
mors were becoming more intense with everyone wondering
what the school policy would be concerning W&L’s first bowl
bid. Michaels ended the season by scoring 25 points in the 67-
7 expected rout of Richmond, but sustained an injury which
caused him to miss the Gator Bowl game.

As Southern Conference Champs with five of the eleven
members on the Virginia All-star team, the Generals quickly
accepted the Gator Bowl bid and began preparations for the
New Year’s classic. The Cowboys of Wyoming, Skyline Con-
ference Champs, however, proved too much for the Lexington
boys as the Generals fell to defeat, 20-7. The loss of Michaels
coupled with Wyoming’s aerial attack gave the Cowboys two
early touchdowns which W&L could never match. ‘Neverthe-
less, as the 1950 Calyx says, “the Bowl Bid was in itself a tri-
bute to our great and very deserving football team.”

 

In another action shot of the W&L Gator Bowl team, halfback Jim
Stark picks up good yardage and reveals why he copped All Southern
Conference honors in 1950.

The Message Of ‘The Night’: |
Man’s Incapacity To Feel

(Continued from page 2)

knowing what they are laughing
about, only trying to be a part, to
feel empathy with them. She fails.
She then returns to a place where
she and Mastroianni used to go when
they were younger. There she is
talked to as if she were a whore.
Mastroianni comes to pick her up.
She is standing by a tree which
has a special place in her memory.
He wonders why she is _ there.
She does not explain. During this
walk, the only sounds are natural
ones. There is little music whatso-
ever. The camera is kept, usually at
a distance. The effect is somnambul-
istic.

Later that night, they are at a
party thrown by a big industrialist.
The party is not a lively one, or at
least doesn’t seem so. Then to make
his point more graphic, Antonioni
livens the party up. It begins to rain
and the people are laughing and
shouting and throwing each other
into the swimming pool. It should
be exciting. But Antonioni keeps
his eamera viewing the party from
a distance; he keeps each individual
isolated in his revelry; he uses no
music. Thus, while watching some-
thing which appears to be wild and
exciting, one feels nothing more
than an extension of the slow, mel-
ancholy feeling which has gone be-
fore.

‘The Finest Scene’

In what is probably the finest
scene in the film, and one of the
truly great scenes in cinema, An-
tonioni watches Jean Moreau and
a man who has picked her up, driv-
ing in the rain. He keeps the
camera outside the car viewing them
through the windshield and window
constantly covered with water. As
the drive, very slowly, they are
sometimes illuminated by _ street
lights, sometimes nothing but shad-
owy outlines. The times when the
light shines represent the moments
when Moreau feels she is living. The
reason it goes dark is because this
is only one more futile attempt.
But the symbolism is not obtrusive
here, for it is only natural that their
figures do become alternately il-
luminated and darkened.

Antonioni’s Theme
Those are several scenes chosen

to illustrate his technique. His sub-|
ject needs elaboration. Antonioni
is dealing with modern man. He is
showing how man today finds it
nearly impossible to feel, to have
a real system of values, to com-
municate with others. His theme}
is not far from one of Yeat’s—that
the best lack all conviction, while
the worst are full of passionate in-
tensity. Mastroianni and Moreau
are bored, unfeeling, living dead. No
mattery how they try to escape it,
this fact seems constant. Antonioni
does not explain why. He presents
his characters and demands that his
audience participate with them. You
are asked to think and feel while

 

you watch them. If there is truth in|
what he says, you will discover it.
Many will not see it as truth, and|
many will find this film boring. I)
think that perhaps there is some con- |
nection between these reactions. I)
personally found truth in his char-|
acters, and his story. I found truth |
in his method of telling the story. |
And I think The Night is one of the!
best films ever made.

(Continued from page 2)

It was a story about war—something
he had already done. He said, “All
that many novelists write in their
later years is simply a recombination
again and again of the scenes and
characters and incidents of their
early work, and with less art and
less enthusiasm and energy.” Per-
haps Hemingway realized that this
indictment also applied to him.

A Short Life Is Better

Even more significantly, Heming-
way described his thoughts as an old
man, at the time he was writing
The Old Man and the Sea: “The
book which I wished to be the
crowning work of my life was The
Old Man and the Sea. The work was
done under great difficulties. Old
age was creeping upon me. But few
men die of old age. Almost all die
of disappointment, passionate, men-
tal or bodily work, or accident. Man
is the most hard worked of all ani-
mals. A long life deprives man of his
optimism. A short life is better.”

tenaciously claim that war is quite
impossible, that the West must be
destroyed by its own “internal cor-
ruption” and Communist goods pro-
duction—not by bombs.

Surely ,we of the West should be
willing to match capitalism with
communism. And if the Soviet is
willing to rule out the use of total
war to accomplish its ends, we
should be willing to do the same.

In short, both sides must real-
ize that total war is no longer a
rational alternative, that both
system are probably here to stay
for quite a while. Consequently,
they will have to get along to-
gether if either is to survive. This
cannot be done by mutual intimi-
dation, or threat of annihilation.

Rather, leaders of both sides will
have to be reasonable with each
other, and see that co-existence can
be accomplished in a way commens-
urate with national and ideological

 

goals. I think that this is possible. |
If men have reason, if men have}

Hemingway Wanted To Live His

Hemingway was the kind of man
who wanted to live life intensely,
and as he realized that the cancer
in his body would drain him more
and more of any intensity, perhaps
he decided to end his life quickly,
but happily, like Francis Macomber;
“a short life is better.”

you may start another one. For
example, if Hairy Collegian played
football and basketball (both occur

football, but would have to get a
0.5 at midsemester to play basketball
in the same semester.

H. Davis writes in the British Med-

that during the first 14 years of the

Medical Contributions of U.S.

Now to the target of Mr. Lewis’s
criticism. Aside from my bias for
freedom over compulsion, I prefer
our system for another reason: it de-
livers the goods. The U.S. has made
more important drug discoveries in
the last two decades than all the
rest of the world combined, 7 times
as many as the next leading country.
And 80 per cent of all these phar-
maceutical wonders were developed
by private industry.

According to the Dept. of Labor’s
Bureau of Statistics of 1960 physi-

.| cians fees had risen 95 per cent and!

all medical costs 115 per cent in the
last 20 years. Compared with 145
per cent for public transportation,
150 per cent for food, 174 per cent
for shoes, 233 per cent for men’s
haircuts, 313 per cent for domestic
servants, the increase is moderate.

Speaking of Austria’s system (not
cited) as long ago as March 8, 1958,
Dr. Karl Kummer, a Labor politician
himself, obeserved, “all who have
had dealings with our compulsory

health insurance complain about
their shortcomings. These institu-
tions have become  collectivistic

bureacracies, frightening to the in-
dividual.”

As Santayana noied, “those who
do not learn from history are
doomed to repeat it.” Let us, then,
work diligently to correct the im-
perfections of our system rather than
discard it for a pitiful experiment in
one that has proven in all its myrid
guises to be costly, inefficient, and,
most importantly, inferior. All at
the price of human freedom.

NOTICE

On January 11, 1964, at about noon,
two students were hitch-hiking to
Washington, D.C., and were picked
up by an older man who had been
involved in an accident. Because
of his condition, he asked the stu-
dents to drive for him as far as
Fairfax. There is some question
about the insurance due to this ac-
cident, and it would help the family
very much if these students would
get in touch with Mrs. McClung in
the Registrar’s Office. It is under-
stood that the students will be
placed under no obligation.
