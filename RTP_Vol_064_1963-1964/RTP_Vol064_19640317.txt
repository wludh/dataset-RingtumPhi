Feddeman Answers Complaints Of Incompetence

By KEN McGRAW
Assistant News Editor

Over the past three weeks a series
of articles and letters which have
appeared in the Friday Edition have
attacked Dr. F. A. Feddeman, school
physician. Last week in an initialed
“Letter to the Editor” the first con-
crete evidence against Feddeman
was presented.

This evidence consisted of four
cases drawn from over the past six
years. In the first case, a student
sick with mononucleosis was not
excused from classes. In the second,
Dr. Feddeman failed to diagnose a
case of appendicitus. The third case
cited involved a serious athletic in-
jury which was not recognized as
such, and, in the fourth, a U. Va.

 

student was refused treatment in

the University’s infirmary.
Feddeman’s Explanation

In an interview yesterday, Dr.
Feddeman freely discussed these
four specific cases in which he was
accused of incompetency to clear up
the apparent misconception which
surround them. As for the student
sick with mononucleosis but not ex-
cused from exams, Dr. Feddeman
stated that the student had had
mono for some time and was in the
process of getting over it when he
first came to the infirmary. Labora-
tory tests were made, but the re-
sults were not immediately avail-
able.

Since the student was not in dan-

 

ger of spreading any disease which
he might have, and since he was
not running a fever, the student was
advised to finish the exams which
he had already begun. When the
lab tests came back showing that
the student was actually sick, he
had already gone home.

Injustice of Letter

The accusation that he failed to
diagnose a case of appendicitis is,
Dr. Feddeman admits, true. The
letter, however, threw this case out
of proportion. The letter does not
consider that over the twelve years
that Dr. Feddeman has been at
Washington and Lee he has had
thousands of students who have
come in with stomach aches. The

 

case cited, which occurred some six
or seven years ago, is the only
one which was not properly handled.
It was his mistake, he readily ad-
mits, but this one case does not
warrant the claims of incompetency
resulting from it.

In regard to the third case which
involved a student injured in ath-
letics, Dr. Feddeman was unable to
comment because the facts presented
in the accusation were too vague. He
could recall no case similar to this.

Student at Fault
The fourth case in question in-
volves, said Dr. Feddeman, a mis-
conception which the letter writer
seems to have of his role and cuties
as school physician and of the func-

 

tion of the school’s infirmary. The
University’s medical staff and facili-
ties, he said, are for students only
and not for students’ dates, friends,
or professors. As for this case in
which the medical staff was criti-
cized for not treating a U. Va. stu-
dent, the boy involved had lied at
the hospital. He told the nurse on
duty that he was a W&L student
and it was for this reason that he
was sent to the infirmary. He was
sent back to the hospital when he
was discovered to be lying, but was
not bleeding at the time, as was
stated in the Friday paper.

Happens Every Year

On the subject in general, Dr.
Feddeman commented that medicine

is not a perfect science. Opinions
differ in individual cases and one
cannot always be right. Also he
stated that the picture changes rap-
idly in many cases. What might
seem to be a harmless cold or
stomach ache at one point can de-
velop, in a short period of time,
symptoms of a more serious sick-
ness. In such cases the medical staff
is helpless unless the student comes
back.

Dr. Feddeman stated that he was
not overly disturbed by the recent
attacks, but naturally does not ap-
preciate them. He pointed out that
something similar to this happens
every year. Last year it was the
Slater System and two years ago
it was the Co-op.

McDowell Delivers Views
On ‘Byrd Organization’

By HOWARD EPSTEIN

Nationally syndicated columnist,
Charles McDowell, Jr., analyzed the
Byrd political organization with its
influence on state and national pol-
itics last night to a crowded Lee
Chapel.

Rejecting his original topic of
“Virginia Politics,’ McDowell limit-
ed his subject to the “Byrd Organi-
zation,” although in many cases both
terms are synonymous. Speaking in
his hometown, he turned the lecture
into a folksy talk studded with hu-
mor and wit that captivated the au-
dience,

He started by describing the head
of the organization, 76-year-old Sen-
ator Harry F. Byrd, as “delightful
and wisest in his own way.” Then,
striking the heart of his speech, he
pointed out that, contrary to most
political machines, the Byrd “organ-
ization” is not thoroughly organ-
ized; rather, the key to its success
in controlling Virginia politics for
the last 40 years has been its di-
versity of leadership, even to the
point of confusion.

The organization itself he believed
to be “good government.” McDowell
first pointed out the lack of graft,
even in the periphery of the or-
ganization. Secondly, he emphasized
great distribution of political power
among the members of the organi-
zation, by demonstrating how Sen-
ator Byrd is acute to the desires of
the conservative democrats.

Extent of Byrd Organization

Thirdly, the extent of the organi-
zation become obvious through Mc-
Dowell’s frequent reference to the
“Byrd men.” Complete with the
Speaker of the House in Virginia,
many legislators, and Governor
Harrison, along with numerous lo-
cal officials, it seemed that every
election since the 1930’s was a con-
test between the “Byrd men” and
some form of opposition.

Another of the organizations’ ad-

In Local Play

Eight Washington and Lee stu-
dents are taking part in a local pro-
duction of the Gilbert and Sullivan
operetta H.MLS, Pinafore.

Taking principle roles in the show
are Phil Booth, a Pi Phi senior, who
appears as Dick Deadeye; Rob
Vaughan, a Delt sophomore, as the
captain; and Bill Supon, a PEP
junior, as the bosun’s mate.

Also in the cast are John Dixon,
Chris Clarke and Fred Taussig.

John Samet and John Czyzewsky
will play in the orchestra.

The operetta will be given March
20 and 21 at 8 pm. in the Wad-
dell School.

Briefly its plot it this: Josephine,
daughter of an English naval cap-
tain, is in love with Ralph Rack-
straw a sailor. Her father is de-
termined she will marry Sir Joseph
Porter, K.C.B., First Lord of the
Admiralty.

vantages is the incompetence of the
opposition. At various times different
groups have challenged the Byrds,
but never with any lasting success.
The G.O.P., until recently, had no
interest in producing a strong par-
ty; the few partymen that existed
claimed party affiliation only in
hopes of political gain if and when
republicans gained office on the na-
tional scale.
Auti-Byrd Faction

Another form of opposition came
from the group whose feelings were
for the party but against the Byrds.
Led by Robert Whitehead this group
nearly toppled the organization on
several occasions, but due to un-
trained workers and an overzealous
drive, they never succeeded.

In national affairs, the Byrds are
a constant federal bug-a-boo. Never
silent, the Virginians are always

Must Commit Themselves Soon

 

Scranton, Lodge Losing Time

By J. BRUCE WHELIHAN

Governor William Scranton of
Pennsylvania was quoted as saying
recently that the race for the pres-
idential nomination at the Repub-
lican National Convention is still
wide open. He is one of the few who
think so.

Many political analysts are say-
ing that Scranton has the best
chance of walking off with the nom-
ination at the convention, which is
to be held in San Francisco be-
ginning July 13. An almost equal
number suggest that Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge’s write-in vic-
tory in New Hampshire has placed
him at the head of the list of hope-
fuls.

A few writers mention former
Vice President Richard Nixon, and
most agree that Arizona’s Senator
Goldwater and New York’s Govern-
or Nelson Rockefeller are lost causes,
in that neither has supporters who
are, above all else, Republicans.

 

Those suggesting that Scranton

will eventually receive the party
nominations are quick to point to
the fact that he is the only candidate,
other than Senator Margaret Chase
Smith of Maine, who is politically
“unsearred and unscathed.”

Scranton, however, is not acting in
accord with the wishes of his back-
ers. Although he has put himself in
the position where he would have
to accept the nomination if it comes,
he has not yet announced that he
desires the nomination. He cannot
wait much longer as a non-candi-
date.

Ambassador Lodge also cannot
wait much longer either. He is in
somewhat the same position as
Seranton as he has refused to sign
an affidavit saying he will not be-
come a candidate for the party nom-
ination under any circumstances.
Such a document is required of per-
sons wishing to withdraw their name
from the list of candidates in the
Oregon presidential preference
primary.

 

Individual Ideas

& Social Reality

Topic Of R-MWC’s 1964 ‘Focus’

The second annual Focus was held |
at Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege on the weekend of March 6, 7,
and 8. A student sponsored sympo-
sium, Focus seeks to tackle a new
topic each year. This year’s theme
was stated as: Individual Ideas and
Social Reality—To Explore the Re- |
lation of Individuals to the Ameri-
can Society. Under a program of
speakers, panels, seminars, and dis-
cussion groups, Focus presents a
critical approach to specific prob-
lems of American life.

 

Aspect of Law Discussed
On Friday, March 6, Dr. Samuel
Stumpf spoke, in the opening
speech, on Law and the Individual. |

Names Remain on Ballot

Both the ambassador and the gov-
ernor have made token efforts to
have their names removed from the
Oregon ballot. Neither name _ has
been withdrawn. The governor has
taken the unusual step of withdraw-
ing his biography from a guide to
be issued to Oregon’s Republican
voters.

What exactly is keeping either
Lodge or Scranton from committing
himself is not clear. Scranton may
be thinking of 1968. Lodge is prob-
ably thinking of Viet-Nam.

Richard Nixon, who is also in the
position of having to accept a draft
if one comes his way, is being pretty
much neglected. Perhaps columnists
have an agreement with the former
Vice President. If you don’t talk
about me, I won’t talk about you.

Candidates Plan Trips Abroad

It is important to note that the
titular head of the Republican par-
ty has increased his staff, for po-
litieal affairs, and is planning some
travel later in the spring. His cal-
endar presently includes trips to
South America and to South Asia.
Governor Scranton is planning a trip
to the Middle East sometime after
the Pennsylvania legislature ad-
journs.

Scranton does not, at the moment,
have the organization strength that
Lodge and Nixon can boast. Lodge’s
group is headed by his son George,
with an assist, interesting enough,
from Robert Mullen. Mullen was
former President Eisenhower's press
manager during the 1952 campaign.

No Word From Eisenhower

One of the most surprising facts
to date that former President
Eisenhower is still to be heard from.
The General close friend of
Lodge, and an admirer of Scranton.
Could the silence an indication
that he already knows what the out-
come is to be? He asked Lodge to

Heart Attack
Hits Gilliam
In Cincinnati

Dean Emeritus Frank J. Gil-
liam, who suffered a_ serious
heart attack in Cincinnati, Ohio,
Friday, seems to be “responding
to treatment” as of Tuesday
morning.

Dean and Mrs. Gilliam had
been on a trip visiting alumni
and prospective W&L students
when he was struck Friday. At
the time, his condition was listed
as critical and it remained so
through Saturday.

However, doctors said then that
if he survived a 72-hour crucial
period his chances for recovery
were good. Although he has
passed through that first three-
day period, Dean Gilliam remains
in very serious condition.

According to Presidential As-
sistant James W. Whitehead,
Dean Gilliam will have to stay in
the Cincinnati hospital “for sev-
eral weeks” before he can be
moved home.

Two years ago, in March, 1961,
Dean Gilliam suffered a _pre-
vious heart attack. At the time
he had just stepped down from
Dea nof Students to Dean of Ad-
missions, from which he retired
at the end of the 1962-63 school
term to become Dean Emeritus.

Mrs. Gilliam is with Dean Gil-
liam, who is in Holmes Hospital
in Cincinnati.

He joined the staff as a reporter
in 1941, after graduation from the
University of Missouri.

Books, Published

His first book, The Sovereign
States, a history of state and federal
conflicts from a States’ Righter’s
point of view, appeared in 1957. The
Smut Peddlers, a study of obscenity
censorship and the pornography
racket followed in 1959. In 1962, his
Southern Case for School Segrega-
tion was published, expounding the
position of Southerners who oppose
integration of public schools.

He has twice won national awards
for his editorial writing. One of
these, the University of Missouri's
medal for distinguished service in
journalism, was awarded him for
his two-year campaign for the re-
lease from prison of a Negro wrong-

ly sentenced to a life term for
murder.
Kilpatrick serves as vice-chair-

man of the Virginia Commission on
Constitutional Government, a state
agency charged with “putting forth
the traditional Southern doctrines
of limited government and _ strict
construction,”

Spokesman for Conservatism

One of the best known and most
highly respected spokesman for po-
litical conservatism, Kilpatrick has
debated with leaders of the civil
rights movement, lectured at various
colleges and patriotic gatherings,
and most recently joined with other
national figures at a conference on
race relations at Haverford and
Bryn Mawr Colleges.

The Passing Of An Epoch:
Requiem For Hell Raisers

They are gone now. The hill must be glad they’re
gone. When they went, a lot of bad things went with
them, if you look at it through the eyes of someone on the
hill.

When they went,
on Sem went.

When they went, back-to-back houseparties went.

When they went, weekday down-the-road teams went.

When they went, makeshift roadblocks of the by-pass
went,

When they went, drinking and spirit at football games
went.

When they went, the Gauley Bridge Hunt Club went
with them. That was so long ago, the story gets around
only rarely now. A group of them got together in a car
and headed for the University of West Virginia for a
party weekend.

The only thing they knew for sure was to turn at
the town of Gauley Bridge, West Virginia—one of those
towns with a garage on one side of the road and a cider
stand on the other. Only by the time they crossed the
state line, they weren’t seeing too well. So they missed
Gauley Bridge, and spent the rest of the day and night
hunting for it. Never did find it.

They are gone now. The hill is surely glad they’re
gone. But with them went a lot of good things about this
place, no matter whose eyes you’re looking through.

Like the speaking tradition. That’s right—they always
spoke. No matter who was passing them—even if they
thought he was a fish. They liked the speaking tradition—
they thought it was natural. They weren’t bent over the
books all the time or sitting in front of the tube stone-
faced; they were together, down the road, or at Doc’s,
or in the living room at the house with the history cold
quizzes. So it was natural to speak; even when it wasn’t
natural, they spoke. That was the way things were done
around here.

That’s all gone now, along with them.

They didn’t worry about whether or not the Assimila-
tion Committee had the right to tell them how to dress,
either. They just wore conventional dress, that’s all. They
did because they were proud of W&L, of its reputation
for having a campus-full of hospitable, well-dressed fun-
loving guys. They wanted to keep that reputation going.

They got their hair cut too. Because they wanted to
look neat. When they were pledges their fraternities
made them get a haircut twice a month. They just kept
the habit. Probably still do.

But that’s all gone now. The hell raisers are gone.
And anybody now who thinks he’s a hell raiser is wrong.
He’s not. He’s just pretending to be. Because a hell raiser
doesn’t wear long hair and sloppy clothes; he doesn’t get
drunk and scream at the top of his lungs until he throws
up

 

the Saturday-night motorcycle raids

That wasnt the hell raisers’ style at all. They were well-
groomed, well-dressed, and they could handle their
liquor and their women in stride. They knew the right
way to raise hell, and they raised a lot of it.

They are gone now. The hill is glad they’re gone. A
lot of problems went along with them. And along with
them went most of the color that made Washington and
Lee distinct.

 

 

We Were Wondering ...

Why the library insists on keeping Lady Chatter-
ley’s Lover and Women in Love on locked reserve
when both novels can be purchased in paperback
form in any bookstore for sixty cents. Thanks, but
no thanks, for protecting our innocence.

 

 

 

 

Fair Play For Feddeman

Dr. F. A. Feddeman, W&L’s school physician, has
been attacked in several articles printed by the Friday
Edition in recent weeks. While there is some truth in the
documented attacks, the nature of these articles has been
close to libelous.

On page one today is a news article which offers stu-
dents the proverbial ‘other side” of the coin. It conclu-
sively shows that Dr. Feddeman’s so-called incompetence
has been blown all out of proportion.

Some students on campus have complaints against the
way they have been treated at the infirmary, and these
complaints may be justified. But if they are to be brought
up for public consumption, they should be objectively
stated.

We certainly deplore the anonymous attacks made in
the Friday Edition against Dr. Feddeman, especially in
terms of the hundreds of students who have always re-
ceived good care from him when they needed it.

 

 

 

“The pang of death, a famous
doctor once told me, is often less
than that of a toothache.”

—Ernest Hemingway

After Ernest Hemingway’s ap-
parent suicide almost three years
ago there was a great deal of specu-
lation as to why he shot himself, if
he did. One such speculation came
from William Faulkner, who dis-
pised Hemingway as a_ literary
artist. It was Faulkner's belief that
Hemingway's scope was extremely
limited, and that in his old age he
had run out of things to say.

Faulkner believed Hemingway
must have realized that he was un-
able to offer anything new to the
literary world, and this realization,
coupled with the fact that he was
dying of cancer, led to his suicide.
Hemingway's skill with guns pre-
cluded the possibility of an accident
in Faulkner’s views.

Hemingway Needed Active Life

In my opinion there is a deeper
reason behind Hemingway’s suicide
which Faulkner may have felt and
left unexpressed. If one looks at
Hemingway’s life, it is immediately
obvious that he was a man filled
with “joie de vie’—he was an
ardent aficionado, if you will, of the
idea of an active life. Fishing, hunt-
ing, skiing, combat, the bull fights,
and expatriate life in Paris after
World War II: all were known inti-
mately by the man Hemingway. He

‘Few Men Die Of Old Age’ -
Ernest Hemingway, Part One

Reviewed by Roger Paine

believed that life must be constantly
affirmed.

In Hemingway’s view, a man ap-
preciates life most when he has
come into close contact with death.
Such contact causes a man to re-
turn to the moments and hours and
days ahead considerably more ap-
preciative of what he has. And
Hemingway came close to death sev-
eral times in his career—when he
was wounded during the war, when
he had dysentery and was flown off
the mountainside that later became
the scene for “The Snows of Kili-
manjaro,” and when he crashed in
Africa in 1954 the world thought he
had been killed.

Action Left in Old Age

These dramatic close calls had
ended, however, in Hemingway’s
later years. He couldn’t move around
as much as he had in the past, and
so his life was becoming rather
perfunctory. To a man such as Hem-
ingway, this was the worst possible
fate. Indeed, Hemingway had tried
to cling to the things he had always
done as he entered old age. He suc-
ceeded for a time, because his body
served him well enough, and his de-
sire pushed his physical strength to
the limit.

But after a time, Hemingway’s
physical strength began to fail him
as the cancer in his body took more
and more control. His spirit still de-
manded the outdoor life of hunting,

      

fishing, and camping, but his body
could not meet the old demand.
Finally, in the last stages of his life,
even his spirit failed him. These
considerations, combined with the
fact that there had been no recent
drama in his life, might well have
driven Hemingway to contemplate
suicide.
Hemingway Broke His Code

If there is any validity to these
assumptions—and they are held by
many more knowledgeable on the
subject than me—then it is interest-
ing to compare the Hemingway
“code” as it appears in his novels
with the way he, himself, responded
in a difficult situation. By commit-
ting suicide, Hemingway was acting
out of character with everything he
ever advocated in his novels.

Hemingway broke his own code
of “holding tight” against all odds,
all pain, all despair. Jake Barnes in
The Sun Also Rises and Frederick
Henry in Farewell to Arms are clas-
sic examples of individuals who hold
tight against the most overwhelming
of circumstances; Robert Jordon in
For Whom the Bell Tolls clings to
his ideals in the face of impossible
odds.

He Couldn't “Hold Tight”

All of these Hemingway heroes
use various opiates to keep them-
selves from becoming neurotic while
they are fighting their desperate

The “Revolution of 63” involves
God. Both the segregationist and the
desegregationist claim company with
God. Though it has
become less pop-
ular to do so, the
- Bible is still em-
ployed in an at-
| tempt to support
_ the practice of ra-
cial segregation.
This is a particu-
larly curious use
of the book, es-
pecially since
racism itself came
into being some
2500 years after the writing of the
passages usually cited. (It is not so
curious, of course, when we note
that “The Old Time Religion” has
always been that brand of Chris-
tianity which grew up from the
revivalism of the 1730’s. We like to
give our fanciful notions status by
showing their ancient lineage, as

though mere age were proof of
authenticity.)
Biblical Support for Segregation?
The segregationists’ two pet pas-
sages are the stories of Noah’s curse
(Gen. 9:20-27) and the Tower of
Babbel (Gen. 11:1-9). (The reader
should read these passages before
continuing.) Concerning the busi-
ness about Noah, it has been claimed
that we have here the clear in-
struction of God that the Negro is
to be separated from the white. Note
some problems with this interpreta-
tion: 1) It assumes that God made
the curse. In fact, Noah did it and
was was just out of bed from a se-
vere drunk! 2) It assumes that the
descendants of the cursed party
should be segregated. In fact, the
story maintains that they should be
“servants” or “slaves.” 3) It assumes
that the original victim was a Negro
(because of a Hebrew variation on
the word “Ham,” meaning black).
In fact, the original victim was not
Ham but Ham’s son, Canaan, whose
name in no way suggests a relation
to the Negroid race.

Real Meaning of Tower Story

Likewise, note about the Tower
story that God’s intent in dividing
men seems to be not an objection

to human unity but to human pre-
sumption, the attempt to storm
Heaven via their tower. Yet this
story is taken as evidence that God
doesn’t want men of different races
to associate with each other and
speak the same language.

In matter of plain fact, the Bible
nowhere gives support to segrega-
tion. If we are to relate God to
racial troubles—and we must—we
will consult his command that we
love our fellowmen. This would
seem to mean, if it is to mean
anything, that we are to seek the
genuine well-being of our fellow-
man. Surely we cannot work to-
ward his genuine well-being by
denying him the fullest opportunity
to develop his ability. This re-
quires, for example, the most ad-
vanced and thorough education pos-
sible. And that requires our placing
of pupils in the school where cur-
ricula makes the most of their in-
dividual talents. That, surely, will
put the better students of both
races together.

So it is that God’s command that
we love our fellows means in effect
“go to school with them.” To think
otherwise would be to believe the
preposterous nonsense that no Ne-
gro child measures up to any white.

one; the other is
the son of a chief
of one of the tribes
of Rhodesia. After
spending several
hours with this
pair I can readily understand why
no one in the State Department is
really anxious to take over Soapy
Williams’ job.

Anti-Western Feeling

First of all, there was a decidedly
anti-Western flavor to a majority of
the comments these two made It
seemed that both of them were all
too willing to be on guard against
the dangers of “western imperial-
ism” and “western colonialism,” and
at the same time unwilling to see
the possibilities of a similar danger

Cockshutt

at the hands of the communist
powers. When I asked how they ex-
plained the apparent popularity of
Cuba and Communist China in so
much of Africa, the Rhodesian re-
plied that “They share with us a
common heritage of exploitation by
the West. They are most concerned
that we maintain our independence.”

The racial situation in Amercia
seemed to distress them immensely
and they both agreed ‘that the prob-
lem was doing tremendous damage
to America’s image in the eyes of
most Africans. Yet when I asked
about the situation of the white man
in their own countries I was inter-
ested to learn that both nations de-
ny citizenship to anyone whose
grandfather was not an African.
When I asked if this was not the
same kind of discrimination which
they attacked in the United States
they answered that this “grandfather
clause” was to prevent the possibili-
ty of a non-African take-over of
their governments by ambitious
white “foreigners” which they felt
would lead to the eventual reestab-
lishment of colonialism.

Nkrumah—Yes!

Finally, neither one of these young
men had enough good things to say

about President Kwame Nkrumah
of Ghana. Yes, he is going to bring
about African unity—and soon. Yes,
he is the “Redeemer” he claims to
be. Yes, he is here to establish a
“new humanity” and provide for a
new future for the downtrodden
masses of Africa who have been ex-
ploited for so many centuries. When
I asked them what it was that made
them believe all of this, my friend
from Rhodesia smiled confidently
and said, “Why he has told us so,”

Racial Situation

I think I should be quick to point
out that we cannot assume that
either of these young men speaks
for all of Africa or even for his
own country. And yet I think their
view of the situation is gaining in
popularity every day. So many of
the same sentiments are expressed
in last week’s Time magazine cover
story and in other recent articles I’ve
read,

The similarities between the situa-
tion in these emerging nations and
our own newly independent colo-
nies in the America of the 18th cen-
tury are striking. Again in history
“a terrible beauty is born.” The
question is: just how terrible, just

how beautiful. :

Freshman
Looks Back
On Semester

By BARRY VAUGHT
Freshman Columnist

Every freshman who enters
Washington and Lee comes with
some pre-determined ideas and
hopes of what the University will
be like and also what he hopes to
accomplish. I arrived with as
many ideas and aspirations as any
freshman. Since Freshman Camp
many of these have been shattered,
but also many others have taken
their places.

The first aspiration was shattered
when I met other freshmen at
camp. I was not the only one with
college boards above 400 nor had I
held any more offices than most of
them in prep school. It was frighten-
ing to think all summer, “I am going
to W&L,” and to get up here and
find 300 others who are my equals.
I also learned at camp why every-
one said I should go to Freshman
Camp, but don’t expect too much.

Rush Week brought other hopes
down despite the flattery, et al. I
was lucky to get into the fraternity
I wanted. Others were not as lucky;
and that made me wonder about the
fairness of it all, especially if you
had a good friend who had gained
the dubious title of NFU.

With classes I, along with most
other freshmen, really got the
bewildered look on my face. All
this in one semester? Then came
my first quiz—it was quite a shock
to read the questions and even more
so when I got the grade. I had
studied for it like any prep school
test, and I sorrowfully found it was
not quite enough preparation.

Then the first big weekend as
a “big college man.” All the wild
tales of W&L parties were forgot-
ten when no one dropped trow’
nor did my date jump in bed. Not
many people got drunk except the
pledges and I found I could not
hold as much whiskey as I thought
I could.

A feeling of loneliness set in after
the initial rush was over. That was
when I first called home. I did not
like to admit it all, but I missed
everything I had ever looked for-
ward to getting away from. After
this I was able to shrug it off most
of the time.

The traditions I had heard sur-
rounded life at W&L seemed mostly
to be scorned by the students, and
the hallowed tradition of beanies was
only a way for all the other students
to bother us. Conventional dress was
something new to me but after a
while it was no big thing. It seemed
like the beauty of the old buildings
faded away with cold weather, But
there seemed to still be the feeling
of beautiful oldness about the cam-
pus.

The weeks quickly went by and
then Thanksgiving with my family.
I was glad to be home, but I
would not admit, nor say that I
did not really want to return to
school. Then Christmas Vacation,
and again it was hard to leave
home, dove fields, good food, and
a car, But exams came so quickly
and studying time went so fast,
all that was only a memory. I did
not find the exams to be that much
harder than high school though
there was so much more to cover.
By the time they were over I was
so glad they were finished I gave
a very little damn how I did on
them, and I was ready for my first
Fancy Dress. Dakota  Staton’s

Handball ‘All Stars’ Issue Challenge To Faculty

As Part Il of the Tuesday’s Sports page’s series, Washington *

and Lee’s greatest unsung sports, we proudly present this week
our second “Forgotten Sport”’—Handball. With the help of the
area’s handball experts, we have picked W&L’s six outstanding
competitors in this sport to compose what we believe to be an un-
beatable All-Star team. Their story and their challenge follow in
Part 1l—Unsung Sports. All photographs by Bill Young.
By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor
As self-appointed captain and mouthpiece of the newly
formed Washington and Lee Handball All-Stars’ Steve ‘‘Bear-
Beatle Wig” Walsh informed the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi that
he and his five cohorts hereby issue a challenge to W&L’s
academic faculty. The All-Stars letter to the faculty (repro-
duced below) failed to mention, as the “‘Bear’’ told this reporter
later, that the term ‘academic faculty” automatically disquali-
fied any member of Washington and Lee’s coaching staff.

To whom it may concern:

We the undersigned in response to the unceasing
antagonism by certain faculty members and as a means

 

Wilmot Kidd (left) prepares to serve to John McDaniel and Mike Brum-
by as W&L’s top three handball aces warm up for the Faculty game.
of redeeming our personal dignity do propose a
student-faculty handball match, and do hereby express
a willingness to participate in such a match at the con-
venience of the faculty team.

The Best Sports News On Campus

 

All-Stars May Play Virginia

This proposed match would mean re-establishment of a
tradition which ended several years ago after the faculty, with

coaches, became so overpowering. Unlike pool, handball has |’

been encouraged by school authorities, and plans may be made,
if this All-Star team survices the faculty games, grades, and
Spring Vacation, for an inter-collegiate match with the Univer-
sity of Virginia. The All-Stars have consented to allow Bob “Big

Brother is Watching” Murray play for the faculty and many]:

feel he may be the professors’ captain. Other scholastic stal-
warts might include President Cole, who has threatened not to
play, however, unless both teams join the CAC; Dean At-
wood, originator of the “pipe smoke” method for covering
stale tobacco juice smells in the courts; and Dr. Cook, who
shuns handball gloves and hits the ball with a 1929 copy of
the Wall Street Journal.

Facing this awesome array of talent, the All-Stars are led
by Seniors “Montana”? Mike Brumby and John “‘Stumper”’
McDaniel. Brumby and McDaniel both credit the other as
being the best in school with so much modesty that the other
members of the team (Walsh, Short, and Blakeslee) feel no
need to extol their own humility. “Montana” Mike is the most
consistent member of the team, yet has missed several matches
when he strayed home to count his money. “Stumper”’ is the
most athletic member of the squad, often getting sports mixed
up (bringing his lacrosse stick to handball games or calling
football signals during matches) , however, he never loses sight
of his main objective in life—to grow three inches taller.

Walsh and Kidd Are Most Interesting

Probably the most interesting members of the team are
Walsh and Wilmot “Smitzy Squid” Kidd. It is often hard for
the players in the neighboring courts to hear due to the, shall
we say, slightly “ungentlemanly like” sounds emanating from

 

*the “Bear.” One such incident occurred when match officials
informed Walsh that it was illegal to wear an empty six-pack
carton on his head while playing, and again when his Beatle
Wig was declared illegal. Smitzy is also known for his aggres-
siveness, both on and off the handball courts and has recently
been selected the ‘Best-Liked” member of the squad. Kidd
combines his fierce competitive spirit with biting cynical humor
to wear down his opponent, and sometimes likes to ask Nir-
vana for that extra measure of luck.

The Final two members of the team, Pete ‘Boom-Boom”’
Blakeslee and Lindsay ‘Fatman’ Short are both left handed
and give the “Mutt and Jeff’? appearance to the All-Stars.

 

mone - fy Oe |

t a ele game, Pete Blakeslee (right) serves to Steve Walsh and
Lindsay Short as this trio works off the “night before.”

Blakeslee, a refugee from the squash courts, is credited as
the “cockiest” member of the squad, having lost only one
match since his sophomore year (that because someone put
glue in his gloves.) The only junior member on the W&L
Handball team is Short, and this “up and comer” is learning
his moves from Walsh, who is definitely judged as the most
agile of the courtsters. Sometimes referred to on the courts as
“Pearshape,” Short is learning to overcome his adversity to
this nickname and appears to be, with a year’s practice, next
year’s team captain.

Midfield, Attack To Be Strong

Lacrosse Outlook Brighter

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

Prospects for a successful lacrosse season seem high for the Washing-
ton and Lee stickmen. The Generals have a good crop of returning veter-
ans and several outstanding rookies and freshmen.

The only possible weak point with respect to experience is the defense
position where the Generals were nearly wiped out by graduation. BILL
GOSSMAN is the only returnee from last year’s squad. Coach BOB Mc-
HENRY has several prospects up from the B Squad and some good recruits
from the freshman ranks. CURT JERNIGAN, JO TARTT and JIM RED-
ENBAUGH are tthe upperclassmen challenging for positions, while LANCE
BENDANN, TED LEACH, and WARREN STEWART are the freshmen
hopefuls. Stewart is being moved to defense from attack, his high school
position. Another man in consideration is BO EARNEST, on last year’s B
syual. Earnest broke his wrist in Spring football practice and will come
out for lacrosse as soon as possible.

The midfield prospects are bright with JAY BOWERSOX, PAT ROB-
ERTSON, DICK DAESNER, BUTCH WEST, and DOUG MORRISON back.
Morrison is somewhat of a question mark this season because he suffered
a severe knee injury last year. McHenry is quite hopeful that Morrison
has fully recovered. West also expects to be reserve goalie. B. squad
graduates are BILLY ANDREWS, BILL PRICE, and ED WOOD. Andrews
will also play attack. JOE HORTON is also returning at midfield position.
To top it off, Co-Captains SYD BUTLER and JOHN McDANIEL will be
holding down two of the midfield spots. It appears that McHenry is pretty
well fixed in this position.

At the attack posts McHenry has three outstanding men back from
last year in RANDY WOOTTON, MIKE MICHAELS, and CARROLL
KLINGELHOFER. These three should be able to hold their own with any
three attack men. Freshman DUNCAN LaMONTE should also see quite a

Student ‘Trainers Play I mportant
Role In University Sport Program

BY DICK DeWAUGH

Four years ago Washington and Lee’s head trainer was
forced to miss several weeks of school because of an illness,
and a student took over for him during this time. From this

evolved W&L’s present Student Varsity Trainer Organization,
an integral part of sports at W&L.*
Coach Norris Eastman, the group’s

 

elected President of the Student

advisor and supervisor, explained
today that this organization is re-
sponsible for the operation and
maintainence of the training room in
the gym, and that each student
trainer is assigned to a specific var-
sity team once a year to tape, ban-
dage and take care, generally, as
far as First Aid goes.

Members of this group must serve
a minimum of five hours a week and
must be available at such times as
Coach Eastman might deem it nec-
essary. Pete Dinkel was recently

bit of action this season.

Last but not least is the goalie, PETE NOONAN. Noonan did a terrific
job last year and is expected to be even better in the nets this time

around. Noonan is also a “holler guy”

and has a tendency to keep the rest

of the team hustling in seemingly lost causes. He seems to instill great

team spirit in the club.

McHenry is also pleased to see BOB HANKEY, JOHN JENNINGS, and
JOHN EDDY MOORE back out this year. Hankey, who will play attack
has the potential to be great, while Jennings and Moore will probably see

a lot of action.

Last week was an exceptionally good week of practice. The team was
blessed with good weather and put out strong effort. Coach DANA SWAN
of the B squad commented on the practice of the varsity this way. “We
are farther along than ever before at this point in preparing for the season.”
Apparently the coaching staff feels that if the weather stays warm and dry,
they will be able to finish reviewing fundamentals ahead of schedule
McHenry hopes to have the team playing as a team before the opening
game on March 26, here, against Williams College. The Generals have a
scrimmage on March 24, here, with Swarthmore as a warmup for the sea-

son’s opener.

sounding off on some issue, even if it
is contradictory to their policy. An
example of this is the solid Virginia
stand in Washington against federal
aid to education, while about 10%
of the salaries of Virginia teachers
are paid by the federal government.
The legislators know this, desire it,
yet still criticize it.
Benefits of Byrd Policies

In Virginia affairs, the Byrds dom-
inate. In McDowell’s view they have
benefited the state through improve-
ments in mental hospitals, schools,
integration problems, and govern-
ment conduct. Their greatest weak-
ness lies in the tradition of the
younger generation following, with-
out question, the policies of their
predecessors. Like all things, facets
of politics change, and so must the
politicians.

Nearing the end of his speech,
McDowell quickly delved into the
history of the organization. Be-
ginning with the birth of Sen. Byrd
in 1887, the group grew slowly
until 1925 when Byrd became gov-
ernor. Finding power, he set up the
organization which has since dom-
inated Virginia politics. Becoming a
United States Senator, Byrd sup-
ported FDR until 1932 when he
broke with his policy. Since then

 

a Moral Force. The four members
were: Arthur Brown of the Peak-
land Baptist Church in Lynchburg;
Dr. Clifford Stanley, Theologian at
Virginia Theological Seminary; Eph-
riam Fischoff, Rabbi at the Agudath
Sholom Synagogue in Lynchburg;
and Rev. John F. Cronin, S.S., As-
sistant Director of the National
Catholic Welfare Conference. Dr.
Djgenerales conducted the seminar
Man’s Potential in the Cosmos,
With Drs. Livingstone and Nisbet,
and Mr. Uviller heading the seminar
on Crime and Neurosis. The last
seminar was Business Practice vs.
Business Ethics under James duPont
of the E. I. duPont deNemours Com-
pany of Delaware, and _ Robert
Lekachmen, economist.

On Sunday, Rev. Cronin spoke on
Religion in Society in the only func-
tion of the day.

 

Byrd has not supported a democratic
presidential nominee.
Plans for future

Then, scaning the future, the col-
umnist said that he couldn’t ac-
curately forecast the Virginia polit-
ical moves, but pointed out how
the Southerners were hoping to at-
tack the Civil Rights Bill, absolve
President Johnson of any associa-
tion with it, and then mutually aid
each other in the coming elections.

(Continued from page 2)

“Thank you, thank you's” will be
hard to forget.

That Monday came too quickly
but with it came a sense of belong-
ing. I had now gotten through a
semester of college life apparently
none the worse for wear. As I look
back on it I feel I have possibly
learned how to live in this world
a little better, how to deal with peo-
ple, and how to accept things as
they are and not try to change the
world. These ideas resulted from
realizing why most things were the
way they are. The traditions are be-
ginning to mean something to me al-
though I would never admit it to
anyone. The campus seems to have,
sometimes, an air of pride about it.
And home does not mean an es-
trangement from everything I like.

Maybe after only a semester up
here I have managed to grow up
a little bit and realize what life
may be like, and I cannot think
of a better place to mature and
become somewhat educated than
here, even though I will still com-
plain about everything possible.
My dreams may have been brok-
en, but they have been replaced
with some intangible feeling I
would not trade for anything.

battles against despair. Philip Young
notes the famous passage: “Religion
is the opium of the people...and
music...and sexual intercourse...
and bread is the opium of the peo-
ple.” The crux of the problem is
that Hemingway’s code held that
men should stand tight against any
odds and reaffirm their lives. Yet
he himself was incapable of holding
tight, and took the shortest way out
of life.

This week I shall examine the
dilemma of Jake Barnes in The Sun
Also Rises, and show how Heming-
way forsook the code by which he
made Jake conduct his life. Those
who have read the novel know
that Jake had been emasculated by
a wound he suffered in the war. At
the same time, Jake loves Lady
Brett Ashley, with whom he has
become associated in the expatriate
life of Paris.

Dilemma of Jake Barnes

During the course of the novel,
Jake must watch other men take
Brett to bed—men whom he realizes
are inferior to him, and undeserv-
ing of Brett’s attention. This situa-
tion places Jake under a tremen-
dous psychological strain, and
though Brett inwardly loves Jake,
she thinks it is better to avoid talk-
ing about their feelings: “Let’s not
talk. Talking’s all bilge.” Jake could
keep himself from talking about his
love for Brett, but not from think-
ing about it.

Thinking about his wound and its
effect on his life turns Jake into an
insomniac: he once slept for six
months with all the lights on in his
room. His role in life is entirely
passive: he tries to forget his di-
lemma by going fishing, playing ten-
nis, watching bull fights, listening
to others’ problems, and at times,
getting good and drunk.

Ritual Is Important

Jake insists upon conducting the
affairs of his life with extreme care:
he buys six tickets to the bull fights
when only five are needed, just in
case an unexpected guest shows up.
Everything he does must be carried
out with proprietry and neatness.
This ritualistic code helps him to
keep going in the face of his prob-
lem. Yet Hemingway, when faced
odds comparable to those he imag-
ined for Jake, could not follow his
own code, or so it seems.

Next Week: The conclusion of this

‘WELL-KNOWN FAMOUS PEOPLE: No. 1

This is the first in a series of 48 million columns examining the
careers of men who have significantly altered the world we live
in. We begin today with Max Planck.

Max Planck (or The Pearl of the Pacific, as he is often
called) gave to modern physics the law known as Planck’s
Constant. Many people when they first hear of this law, throw
up their hands and exclaim, “Golly whiskers, this is too deep
for little old me!”

(Incidentally, speaking of whiskers, I cannot help but men-
tion Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades, Personna is the
blade for people who can’t shave after every meal. It shaves
you closely, cleanly, and more frequently than any other
stainless steel blade on the market. The makers of Personna
have publicly declared—and do here repeat—that if Personna
Blades don’t give you more luxury shaves than any other
stainless steel blade, they will buy you whatever blade you
a9 is better. Could anything be more fair? I, for one, think
not.

But I digress. We were speaking of Planck’s Constant, which
is not, as many think, difficult to understand. It simply states
that matter sometimes behaves like waves, and waves some-
times behave like matter. To give you a homely illustration,
pick up your pencil and wave it. Your pencil, you will surely
agree, is matter—yet look at the little rascal wave! Or take
flags. Or Ann-Margret.

Planck’s Constant, uncomplicated as it is, nevertheless pro-
vided science with the key that unlocked the atom, made space
travel possible, and conquered denture slippage. Honors were
heaped upon Mr, Planck (or The City of Brotherly Love, as
he is familiarly known as). He was awarded the Nobel Prize,
the Little Brown Jug, and Disneyland. But the honor that
pleased Mr. Planck most was that plankton were named after
him.

Plankton, as we know, are the floating colonies of one-celled
animals on which fishes feed. Plankton, in their turn, feed
upon one-half celled animals called krill (named, incidentally,
after Dr. Morris Krill who invented the house cat). Krill, in
their turn, feed upon peanut butter sandwiches mostly—or,
when they are in season, cheeseburgers.

But I digress. Back to Max Planck who, it must be said,
showed no indication of his scientific genius as a youngster.
In fact, for the first six years of his life he did not speak at all
except to pound his spoon on his bowl and shout “More gruel!”
Imagine, then, the surprise of his parents when on his seventh
birthday little Max suddenly cried, “Papa! Mama! Something
is wrong with the Second Law of Thermodynamics!’ So aston-
ished were the elder Plancks that they rushed out and dug the
Kiel Canal.

Meanwhile Max, constructing a crude Petrie dish out of two
small pieces of petrie and his gruel bowl, began to experiment
with thermodynamics. By dinner time he had discovered
Planck’s Constant. Hungry but happy, he rushed to Heidelberg
University to announce his findings. He arrived, unfortunately,
during the Erich von Stroheim Sesquicentennial, and everyone
was so busy dancing and duelling that young Planck could find
nobody to listen to him. The festival, however, ended after
two years and Planck was finally able to report his discovery.

Well sir, the rest is history. Linstein gaily cried, “E equals
me squared!” Edison invented Marconi. Eli Whitney invented
Georgia Tech, and Michelangelo invented the ceiling. This
later became known as the Humboldt Current.

Mr. Shulman is, of course, joshing, but the makers of
Personna Blades are not: if, after trying our blades, you
think there’s another stainless steel blade that gives you
more luxury shaves, return the unused Personnas to Box
500, Staunton, Va., and we'll buy you a pack of any blade
vou think is better.
