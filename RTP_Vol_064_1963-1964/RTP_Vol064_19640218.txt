ommittee On Fraternities W1
Newly - Proposed IFC Constitution T

By ART BROADUS
President, Interfraternity Council

In the next few weeks, the proposed Constitution will come
to the floor of the IFC. We feel an obligation to present, in
explicit form, some of the thoughts which prompted the new
measures, so that the school community might understand.

In the following article, we shall discuss why we feel that
change is necessary, and then we will relate several of the spe-
cific proposals.

The rather dynamic clashes between varying fraternity
systems and school administration across the nation in the last
decade are indicative of a mood not altogether lacking at
Washington and Lee. The mood also permeates the town of
Lexington. The public image of fraternities has declined stead-
ily over the years. The blame for this must and should lie with
the fraternities.

Public Image of Fraternities
An alarming number of people view the fraternity simply

Review

his Friday

as a volcanic structure which erupts blatantly on the weekend
and grumbles noisily throughout the remainder of the week.
It is an easy matter to say that this opinion is both narrow and
shallow as it obviously is. But the fraternities have made little
effort to erect any other public image of themselves, having
adopted, for the most part, a withdrawn and reactionary policy.

The IFC Charity Fund of this year is painful evidence of
the policy in operation. It seems that a significant number of
fraternity members feel that the townspeople should be con-
tent with the financial benefits which they reap from the fra-
ternities and should keep their noses to themselves, their lips
set in a mercenary smile. This opinion is no more creditable
than the one above which we termed narrow and shallow.

Academic and Social Issues

The major issues contested between the Washington and
Lee faculty and the fraternities are academic and social. Both
problems are dynamic and multi-faceted and defy concise des-
cription. It is difficult to argue the academic question in either

direction, for studies appear to be predominantly an individual
matter. The immature student will find simple means of dis-
traction under any conditions.

The same argument may be maintained as regards social
behavior, but here it is somewhat less defensible. Fraternity
parties are almost invariably linked with the use of differing
quantities of alcohol, and here lies the real problem. The dif-
ference between right and wrong becomes hazier in arithmetic

progress from drink to drink, both finally joining hands in
stumbling oblivion.
Duty of Legitimate

It is superfluous to add that the problems noted in the
preceding paragraphs are harly restricted to fraternities. But
we must remember that the fraternities are in the spotlight.
A legitimate Interfraternity Council should recognize all of
these trouble areas and should attempt to legislate them to
the best of its ability. This is not so easily done.

Origins G Failure Of Act
Discussed By Dr. Behrman

By HOWARD EPSTEIN
Associate Editor
Speaking last night to a filled Lee Chapel, Dr. Jack N.
Behrman, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Domestic and
International Affairs, described the Trade Expansion Act of

 

1962 from its origin to its present affects and its future im-
*

plications.

Beginning his lecture, he pointed
out the causes and the needs for the
act, which he broke into four dis-
tinct groupings: First, the need for
a continuation of the Reciprocal
Trade Agreement that recently ex-
pired. Dr. Behrman mentioned that
although trade would continue after
the expiration of the agreement, no
expansion or revision was possible.

Second, the need for trade ex-
pansion with the European Common
Market. Third, expansion with the
European Free Trade Association
(EFTA). And fourth, the need for
greater trade with less developed
nations.

Policy Discussions

With these purposes in mind, poli-
cy discussions with the departments
of Labor, Agriculture, Commerce,
and State were started in the middle
of 1961 and rushed into form. The
proposed bill that emerged called
for radical changes in U.S. trade
policy.

The first provision called for the
delegation of authority to the Presi-
dent to be able to cut tariffs by
50 per cent, including across-the-
board slashes. Added to this was
the authority to cut tariffs to the
Common Market to zero on those
items in which either US. or the

Common Market dominated the
world market.
The bill further demanded the

abolition of the Nuisance Tariffs (less
than 5 per cent) and the special at-
tention to tropical products coming
from Latin countries. A section was
provided for agricultural agreements
and the nullification of the Peril-

Talbot To Speak
Tomorrow Night
On U.S. Affairs

On Wednesday evening the final
lecture in the current series spon-
sored by the University’s School
of Commerce and Administration in
conjunction with International Re-
lations Week will be given by Philips
Talbot. Dr. Talbot, Asistant Secre-
tary of State for Near Eastern and
South Asian Affairs, will speak on
“Problems in International Rela-
tions.”

Dr. Talbot knows his area of re-
sponsibility at the State Department

from on-the-scene experience. For |

10 years he lived and traveled in
Asia as a student, Navy Officer, for-
eign correspondent and diplomate.

He studied at Algar Muslim Uni-
versity in India and the School of
Oriental and African Studies at
the University of London. He was
also executive director of Amer-
ican Universities Field Staff, Inc.
for 10 years.

Talbot holds both B.A. and BS.
degrees from the University of II-
linois and received his Ph.D. at the
University of Chicago.

International Relations Week is
held annually to provoke interest

among students in international
politics. The program was begun
through the efforts of Professor

Harvey Wheeler of the political sci-
ence department.

 

Peace Corps Placement Exams

Given To Minks And Cadets

By STIRLING LATHROP

On February 14 placement exams
were administered to Peace Corps |
applicants at VMI, with four Wash- |
ington and Lee students and three
cadets participating. Performance on
the tests, personal information, and
consulted references are the factors
considered in making the final de-
cisions concerning applicants, and
where they would be best suited for
a Peace Corps’ project.

The tests themselves are non-
competitive, and are not marked

for passing or failing grades, but
assist mainly in helping the Peace
Corps assign applicants to an area
of Peace Corps work. In general

the tests are administered at the

Post Office from every six weeks

to two months, and will most like-
ly be given again in May.

Applicants for the Peace Corps
must be American citizens, and if!

Unsung, Un

Perform Backstage Roles

By KEN McGRAW

Behind the scenes in every sense
of the phrase are the backstage
workers at the Troubadour Theater.
They rank with the nightwatchman
and the postman in respect to the
unsung, unnoticed work they per-
form. The necessity of their work is
apparent but often is taken for
granted.

For the upcoming play, Dr. Faust-
us, there will be some thirty odd
students playing key roles in the
production who will never go on
stage. These are the technicians, car-
penters, makeup artists, prop men,
and members of the business staff.

Dr. Cecil Jones, Director of the
Troub Theater, cited all these stu-
dents for the importance of their
work but particularly those working
as supervisors and crew heads.

The Stage Manager for Dr.
Faustus is Don Lineback. His job
is to coordinate and supervice the
work of all the backstage crews. The
seasonal stage manager for the
Troubs is Dan Friedman who, for
this production, has been put in
charge of all the technical work.
Friedman works along with Kim

supervisor of the set crews, respon-
sible for all the permanent construc-
tion. For Faustus this consists in a
reproduction of the Elizabethan
stage.

The lighting for Faustus is ex-
tremely important to the effect of the
play and comes under the responsi-
bility of Wink McKinnon, master
electrician. Lighting changes in some
places constitute scene changes and
are also important in creating the
mood. The final student supervisor
for the upeoming production is Kirk
Griffin who is production supervi-
sor. He will be in charge during the
performances.

The movable props are the re-
sponsibility of property master Cary
Williams. Bruce Whelihan, sound

master carpenter, as joint |

seen Heroes

, engineer, is in charge of all the sound
effects and music. Jerry Koffman is
the make-up artist and Drew Baur
is in charge of the box office. These
last four are the crew heads, and
each has a number of students work-
ing with them.

Debaters Tally |
Winning Record
At Tournament

By STIRLING LATHROP

Representing the University for
the first time at the Dartmouth In-
vitational Debate Tournament this
past weekend, a Washington and Lee
debate team composed of two soph-
omores, Ed Fitzgerald and John Mc-
Murray defeated Cornell, Norwich,
Penn. State, St. John’s and South-
western Missouri, while losing to
Wayne State, Northwestern § and
Fordham.

The Dartmouth Tournament is al-
ways one of the two or three finest
in the nation, and the results posted
by the W&L team here were the
best ever recorded by a W&L team
in the northeast during the last 10
years.

Dual Meet Coming Up

This coming Wednesday, February
19, a Washington and Lee debate
team will participate in a dual meet
with Roanoke and VPI at VPI in
Blacksburg. Debate coach, Dr. Chaf-
fin, will send Allen Cohen, Claude
Rogers, and Billy Want, and is as
yet undecided about the fourth.

Again, on Saturday, two teams
will represent W&L at the second
Richmond Invitational Tournament.
A novice and varsity team will de-
bate both sides of this year’s re-
solve in six rounds of debate. Rick
Kneipper and Jack Eure will com-
prise the varsity squad with Bill
Grant and Claude Rogers forming
the novice team.

Norton and Frazier Win

Two weeks ago, on February 7th
and 8th, a W&L team of Sam Frazier
and Ed Norton posted a 4-2 record
at the King’s Tournament, sponsored
by King College in Wilkes-Barre,
Penn. With Norton, a senior, coming
out of retirement, the pair lost their
first two contests, then came back to
capture the last four. Debating for
the first time together, they repre-
sented W&L against thirty-one
teams from thirty colleges.

Notice

The Tuesday Edition of the Ring-
tum Phi will hold a staff meeting in
Room 23 of the Student Union on
Friday at 5 p.m.

 

ANECDOTE OF THE WEEK

Greeting on former president
Eisenhower’s door mat: “Ah, ah,
er, ah, ahh—Welcome.”

Kence.

CORE director James Farmer par-
ticipated with James Kilpatrick, edi-
tor of the Richmond News-Leader
and author of The Case for Segre-
gation in the South in a panel dis-
cussion.

While each man was ostensibly
to present his own position, the
“panel discussion” quickly became a
debate over the most hotly discussed
points in the civil rights movement:
Negro inferiority and property rights.

Kilpatrick contended that Ne-
groes are, in fact, inherently in-
ferior as a race to whites. He
pointed to what he called “flimsy”
contributions of Negroes through-
out history in areas of ethics, cul-
ture, and politics—and further in-
dicated that anthropoligical evi-
dence proving Negro inferiority
“has been shamefully suppressed.”

Moving to the area of legal ac-
tion, Kilpatrick said he felt laws
enforcing segregation or integration
wrong; he asserted his belief in
limited government, and said that
this principle was seriously threaten-
ed by federal intervention in current
civil rights controversy.

The first human right, Kilpatrick
insisted, “is the right of property;
unless property rights are secure,
Americans’ freedom is not secure.”
Citing both the fourth and four-
teenth Constitutional Amendments
as guarantees of property rights,
Kilpatrick said that while Negroes
want the right to buy, “we want the
right not to sell.”

Farmer took issue, as was to be
expected, with Kilpatrick’s assertion
of Negro inferiority.

He first cited several sources
which, he said, established the fact
that Negroes had produced highly
complex civilizations—lost cities
in Africa, He further quoted the
American Society of Anthropology
in its statement that “There are
no scientific grounds for assuming
either inferiority or superiority of
one race over another.”

After having made his case against
racial inequality, Farmer declared
the whole question irrelevant. “All
science could establish would be an
average man,” he said. “The Amer-
ican Dream is based on individual
rights, not the idea of an average
man,”

“Suppose science could establish
‘Negro’ inferiority— would I then be
disallowed to pursue my own indi-
vidual potentialities?”

Farmer attempted to answer Kil-
patrick’s limited government argu-
ment by saying that “laws are im-
portant, not to change men’s views,
but to regulate their actions so as
not ‘to interfere with other men.”

As for property rights, Farmer
held that when an individual runs

Tuesday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

A Journalistic Milestone

We heartily applaud the latest example of the Friday
Edition’s perceptive and well-expressed editorial policy.
While we cannot hope to match its facility of expression or
its depth of thought, we at least can concur with what
they say. Surely no one can disagree with us in our praise
for that hallmark of editorial comment, ‘Filet Mignon In
The Commons?”

But...

You First! No, You First!

With a singular and remarkable consistency, the Fri-
day Edition has once again missed the point in an issue
of major importance. Their coup de grace of last week,
“An Unjust Attack,” plumbed new depths of irrelevance.
It saddens us to note that in their zeal to “correct some
misgivings” in our paper, the Friday editors demonstrated
their inability to understand the crux of the W&L inte-
gration problem.

As usual, the Friday editor was claiming his editorial
as the exponent of the real truth. His revelation was that
no Negro has ever submitted a completed application to
W&L. In last Tuesday’s paper, this truth can be found
on page one, about two inches from the bottom in column
three.

All White Student Body ‘No Coincidence’

“An Unjust Attack” then suggests that in theory there
is no evidence that W&L is segregated. We suggest that
the Friday editor glance around for a day or two at his
fellow students. We submit that it is no mere coincidence,
theory or no theory, that they are all white.

We admit that there has been no real test, in the form
of an application from a Negro, to show conclusively
what W&L’s policy might be. We stated last Tuesday
that the Admissions Committee “seemingly must skip
over” Negro applications. The Friday editor quoted that
same statement, leaving out the first word. We did not
mean to sound as positive as the Friday editor thought;
rather, we wanted to convey the ambiguity of the entire
situation.

No Movement Intended—Just An Opinion

No one knows what the University would do—that is
true—but the general impression is that the Trustees have
a negative opinion vis-a-vis integrating W&L. We are not
attempting to start a movement to force the Trustees to
an immediate decision; we merely think it is time that some
students’ opinions started going down on record.

Our position is that W&L should not expect the
Negro to go all the way in the solving of our problem,
and submit an application to an all-white University which
has remained silent on the integration issue. A student
from Hampton Institute put it this way: if a student wants
to join a fraternity, but that fraternity has shown no signs
of interest in him, the student does not write a letter to
the fraternity asking to be considered for membership.
The first move is up to the fraternity.

Position Should Be Declared

This analogy can be applied in part to W&L. Our part
of the bargain should be to declare, simply, that we will
not refuse a qualified applicant because of his race. Is that
too much to ask, especially in terms of what so many other
public and private southern institutions have done al-
ready?

On one side, there ar« the Trustees who choose to al-
low W&L’s position to remain ambiguous. On the other
side are Negro high school graduates, who seem hesitant
to apply to a college in W&L’s category: all white and
undeclared on the race issue. W&L has lost the chance to
be a good leader; why not be a good follower? Or do we
wait until some organization tries to break the stalemate
by pushing a Negro through the barrier of our indecision,
with all the unpleasantness which would accompany such
an attempt?

Negro Social Situation Poses No Problem

Although the Friday editor’s questions about Negroes
wanting to come here, and about their probable social
status once here, are absolutely irrelevant to the issue at
hand, we want to say this: we have talked to Negroes
who would apply to W&L were the school officially open-
ed to them; we are sure they would have no more prob-
lems with dating than any other W&L man has; and, we
have enough confidence in the W&L student body to say
that they would have as many close friends, if not more,
as any other student here.

 

We Were Wondering .. .
Why the Executive Committee, after exterminat-
ing Addison Brokenrecord (as the Friday Edition
claims) overlooked Drew Baur in the process.

 

 

 

   

I would like to devote this
column to a review of five books,
all of them available in paperback,
which I have read and enjoyed
recently and which I’d like to pass
on to you.

The first book is entitled Excel-
lence: Can we be equal and excel-
lent too? Written by John W. Gard-
ner, President of the Carnegie Foun-
dation for the Advancement of
teaching, the book explores the con-
ditions under which excellence is
possible in American society today.
The concept of equality is also ex-
amined as the author seeks “the
kinds of equality that can and must
be honored, and the kinds that can-
not be forced.”

What difficulties does a democracy
encounter in pursuing excellence?
Is there a way out of these difficul-
ties? How equal do we really want
to be? It would seem that in the
light of the debates now going
on over the national purposes, civil
rights, and social welfare, a book
which deals with these crucial ques-
tions ought to be at the top of every-
one’s reading list.

Five Controversial Books
Suggested for Extra Reading

Reviewed by Rod Cockshutt

For the New Intellectual

The second book I’d like to recom-
mend is Ayn Rand’s For the New
Intellectual. Here, in one book, are
the fundamentals of her interesting
philosophy, “objectivism.” The theor-
ies are laid down in a series of orig-
inal essays, as well as selected ex-
cerpts from her already published
fictional works. And while many
will find Miss Rand’s ethical and
“humanitarian” theories personally

repugnant, we cannot deny that
what she says is both fascinating and
thought-provoking.

Dostoevsky

Next is Russian philosopher and
theologian Nicholas Berdyaev’s com-
pelling study, Dostoevsky. The book
attempts to look into the great Rus-
sian author’s spiritual side. As Berd
yaev himself says: “I want to ex-
plore in depth the way in which he
apprehended the universe and intui-
tively to reconstruct out of these
elements his whole world vision.”
This is difficult reading but by no
means unintelligible, and definitely
worth the effort.

Fourth is Michael Harrington’s dis-

turbing essay on poverty in the
United States today, The Other
America, The author’s claim is that
there are close to fifty million Amer-
icans living today without adequate
food, housing, education and medi-
cal care. Harrington fears that the
image of America given us by Madi-
son Avenue and other believers in
the “affluent society” is dulling our
conscience and making us unaware
of the situation that a sizeable por-
tion of our population must live in.

Finally, I'd like to recommend
The Predicament of the Democratic
Man by Dr. Edmond Cahn, Profes-
sor of Law at New York University.
The book examines the whole idea of
civic responsibility, both collective
and individual, in a democracy, and
helps to define what levels of partic-
ipation in government the democratic
man can and should attain.

All five of these books are contro-
versial in one way or another, All
are full of ideas which we are free
to accept or reject. But I believe
that all of them are timely and speak
boldly to each of us, no matter what
our special interest or areas of
specialization.

Jules and Jim’...Latest Truffaut Hit

By TOM PACE
“Jules and Jim’—a film by
Francois Truffaut. With Jean

Moreau, Oskar Werner, and Henri
Serre. Written by Truffaut, with
music by George Delerue. “Jules
and Jim” opens at the Lyric Wed-
nesday.

“The Prize’—a film starring Paul
Newman. With Elke Sommer, Diane
Baker, and Edward G. Robinson.
Directed by Mark Robson. Written
by Ernest Lehman, based on a
novel by Irving Wallace. “The Prize”
begins Sunday at the State.

“Jules and Jim” is Francios Tru-
ffaut’s finest film to dite Truffaut
and Alain Resnais (“Last Year at
Marienbad”) are the two most
exciting, and probably the two best
foreign directors working at pres-
ent. It follows then, that “Jules
and Jim” is one of the great films
of the last few years.

The Story—Jules, a German, goes
to Paris, where he meets Jim with
whom he becomes fast friends. They
are very happy in their relationship.
Jules and Jim meet Catherine. She
only to be parted by World War I.
The war also splits up the two men.
During the war, Catherine has a
child.

The War ends and the two men
begin to correspond again. Jim comes
to visit Jules and his wife. He
notices a strain between the two.

Seeing that Catherine is about to
abandon Jules, Jim, with Jules’
urging, steps in and begins an af-
fair with her. As a result the house
becomes serene, content, and happy
once more. (For though Catherine
shares a bed with Jim, Jules is
made happy merely by her pres-
ence.)

Catherine grows tired of Jim
and rejects him. Later she asks
him back, but he refuses. Several
months after this Jules and Cath-
erine meet Jim, accidentally, at a
movie house. The three go off for
an afternoon of conversation and
and lemonade. Catherine asks Jim
to go for a ride with her in the
car. She drives them off a bridge
which had been bombed in the
war, and they are drowned. Jules
then goes threugh the ordeal of
their cremation and interment; the
last seene shows him walking
down the hill away from the cem-
etery.

Truffaut is dealing with many
things. As the title suggests, he is
dealing with the value of a full and
real friendship between two men.
Nonetheless, he seems more interest-
ed in the character of Catherine, and
the way in which she embodies the
characteristics of his concept of love.
He shows so honestly, through her,
the essence of love; it is gay and
pleasant, harmful and frightening,
inconsistent, conconstant, and im-

pure. But it is the most, the best
we have.

His style and treatment coincide
with his theme. “Jules and Jim” has
a continuity of real motion, motion
provided by expert use of the cam-
era. The film flows, halts, walks,
and runs. It is this motion that dis-
tinguishes Truffaut from other di-
rectors. It is this which makes his

films delightful and musical.

One particular scene, the “village
idiot” scene, exemplifies his genius
best. It involves revolving the
camera around one person, and
then another in rapid fire motion;
then stepping back quickly to view
the whole action, and then into the
fray again, moving and revolving
from person to person. His camera
is constantly moving—in an air-
plane, in his unsteady hand, in a
circular motion, in brilliant jarring
closeups, and in a slow, smooth
traversing movement. Truffaut is
also the master of the quick cut,
as evidenced in the presentation
of titles, or when Jean Moreau
first appears,

This is not to suggest his film is
devoid of faults. There are several
scenes which do not come off quite
right. There are even some which are
dull. Also I don’t believe that Tru-
ffaut delivers the impact that he
wants; for I feel too little sympathy
for his characters. (A fault which

Goldwater’s Position on ICBM’s, Cuba,
Atlantic Alliance Makes Voters Think

Editor’s Note: “Political Horiz-
ons” is an open column, and we
welcome any qualified student or
faculty member to present views
which differ from those expressed
by Mr. Durrette. If interested,
contact Roger Paine, HO 3-4015,
by Thursday of the week before
the paper is published.

By WYATT B. DURRETTE, JR.

Att the time he announced his can-
didaey, Barry Goldwater clearly set
— tne tone of his

~ campaign by tell-
' ing the American
people he intend-
ed to offer us “a
choice, not an
echo.” He has.
_ Consequently, the
. smug and confi-
dent defenders of
the status quo, the
practioners of that
hallowed _ ortho-
doxy which has
for 30 years remained beyond re-
proach, have stepped up to the firing
line. Target? Goldwater.

In the areas of defense and foreign
policy the Senator is particularly
controversial. Since beginning his
campaign he has told us that: (1)
our ICBM’s are not dependable; (2)
he favored granting authority to the
Supreme Commander of NATO to

 

Durrette

use tactical nuclear weapons in the
event of hostilities in Burope; (3)
he would have ordered U.S. Marines
to cut back on our water outside of
“Gitmo”; (4) he would use Amer-
ican warships to prevent trade with
communist Cuba by friend or foe.

Reaction to Goldwater

Immediately the cries reverber-
ated: “unreasonable”; “relaxation of
tensions”; “unrealistic”; “invitation
to annihilation”; “endangering sensi-
tive negotiations”; ete.; ad infinitum,
ad nauseam. The voices of paralysis,
of negativism, of compromise, nego-
tiate, and retreat that have dominat-
ed U.S. policy since World War II
have risen from the wastelands to
engage the harbinger from Arizona.

Unrealistic? In 1961 before a Sen-
ate subcommittee Secretary MeNa-
mara testified regarding his doubts
as to the hardness of our missle sites.
Goldwater does this and he’s “irre-
sponsible.” Under ideal conditions
30 per cent of our ICBM’s have failed
to leave the launching pad. We do
not know what effect a high yield
atmospheric nuclear explosion may
have on the electronic guidance sys-
tem of our missles.

These doubts are shared by mem-
bers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, par-
ticular Gen. Curtis LeMay, as well
as Dr. Teller and Gen. Powers.

Unrealistic? On the day the Sena-

tor made the statement a nuclear
submarine test fired 3 Polaris mis-
sles—2 failed to get out of the water!
The answers to the doubts Barry
Goldwater has raised lie sealed in-
definitely beneath the strictures of
the Treaty of Moscow.

Add to this the fact that our pres-
ent defense policy, as I understand
it, anticipates no future develop-
ments in manned bombers which
means as the Senator once said that
“all our eggs are in the missle bas-
ket.” Since to a man military wit-
nesses testified that the Test Ban
Treaty was militarily disadvantag-
eous to the U.S., what is unrealistic
about suggesting that we should test
the strength of the “weave” of the
“basket?”

Trouble in Atlantic Alliance

Unreasonable? Without a doubt
the Atlantic Alliance is in trouble.
Lord Hume’s “bussing” with Castro,
DeGaulle’s recognition of Mao’s Red
Terror and failure to sign the Mos-
cow Treaty, the Skybolt cancellation,
the Suez incident, out attitude over
Angola and Mozabique have, among
other things, contributed towards a
weaking of the ties among the 15
member NATO alliance.

Life magazine:

Percy Novel
[ nvestigates

Deep Reality

By BERT PHILLIPS
Walker Percy: The Moviegoer—
(Popular Library, $1.50)
the specific character of despair is
precisely this:
it is unaware of being despair
—Soren Kierkegaard,
The Sickness Unto Death

“For years I have had no friends.
I spend my entire time working,
making money,
going to the mov-
ies and_ seeking
company of wo-
men... .” So be-
gins the story of
Binx Bolling, cen-
tral character in

 

Walter Percy’s
first novel, The
Moviegoer,.

Binx is just

short of 30, of good
family, a veteran
of the Korean War and a securities
salesman with an ability for calling
the turns in his trade. His surface
trouble is that life seems like a
chronic sickness; his fear is of de-
feat by “everydayness.” Life around
him seems fat, genial, kindly—and
stupid.

“Men are dead, dead, dead; and
the malaise has settled like a fall-
out and what people really fear
is not that the bomb will fall but
that the bomb will not fall....”
Comfortable, well heeled Binx
habitually sleeps with his secre-
taries and finds that the movies
are a deeper reality than the life
around him.

But sex and movies are not
enough, and always vaguely he is
engaged in a search for a deeper
reality, some card of identity that
will get him through better doors
than the ones his pocketful of credit
cards enable him to pass through.

A reviewer for Time remarked:
“Author Percy appears, his first time
out, clothed in originality, intelli-
gence and a fierce regard for Man’s
fate. In The Moviegoer, he writes
about New Orleans and the sur-
rounding countryside as though he
had created it, but that is almost the
least of his virtues. The main fact
is that his theme—the despair that
attacks the numberless people in
their inmost minds—is handled with
just the right degree of seriousness
and humor, of rancor and indiffer-
ence... Percy, a natural writer, has
a rare talent for making his people,
Negro, Jew, or Southern aristocrat,
look and sound as though they were
being seen and heard for the first
time by anyone,”

The Moviegoer was awarded the
following citation for being named
winner of the 1962 National Book
Award for Fiction: The Moviegoer,
in intimation rather than a statement
of morality and the inevitable of
that condition, is a truthful novel
with shocks of recognition and
spasms of nostalgia for every—or
nearly every—American. Mr. Percy,
with compassion and without senti-
mentality or the mannerisms of the
clinic, examines the delusions and
hallucinations and the daydreams
and the dreams that afflict those who
abstain from the customary ways of
making do,”

Mermen Down Old Dominion, Lose To Md.
Wrestlers Overwhelmed By E &M 19-9

Wolfe, Relay Team Set New’
Records At Old Dominion

By SKIP CHASE
Tuesday Sports Writer

The Generals of Norris Eastman kept their seasonal rec-

ord above .500 by beating Old

ing to the powerful Terps of Maryland. The weekend trip left

the swim team, 5-4, with only strong East Carolina College
*left on the slate.

 

 

Lou Paterno, who scored 43 points
in last week’s two games,

Cagers Beaten
Up Loss Skein

By TOM CARPENTER

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team had another unsuccessful
road trip over the weekend, despite
two players setting career scoring
highs. Howard Martin scored 20
points against Baltimore University,
but the Generals succumbed, 97-81,
Friday night. In Saturday’s game
Fred Mindel tallied 21 points, but
Lebanon Valley came out on top, 96-
75.

Baltimore used its height advant-
age as best as possible and were
still fortunate to come out ahead.
The Marylanders got off 94 shots,
the most taken against the Generals
this season. Using their two six foot-
five inch inside men, the winners
completely controlled the back-
boards, which allowed them to take
all those shots. The Generals shot
84 per cent but were able to get off
only 64 shots.

Paterno Scores 27

Lou Paterno was high scorer for
W&L with 27 points. Martin, be-
sides scoring 20 points, was the
only man for the losers who was able
to contest the bigger host team play-
on the boards.

Lebanon Valley had little trouble
in coasting to victory. Paterno had
16 points and Martin had 12. Mindel
was high with his personal record
breaking performance. The Dutch-
men’s victory dropped the Generals’
record to three wins and 12 losses.

RPI brings the Generals’ regular
season to a close here tonight at
8. The Richmonders won an earlier
contest between the two clubs. To-
night also marks the end of Coach
Bob McHenry’s tenure at Washing-
ton and Lee on his home court,
where he starred in many a game
during his years here as an under-
graduate.

After RPI, W&L moves to Mem-

Dominion of Norfolk and loos-

At Old Dominion, W&L dominated
the meet and set pool records in
both the 500-yard freestyle (by John
Wolfe in 5:59.8) and the 400-yard
freestyle relay team of Bart Taylor,
Skip Chase, Walt McManus and Bill
Wildrick. Firsts were also taken
in the medley relay, 50-yard free-
style, diving by David Geer, individ-
ual medley by George Bokinsky, 200-
yard backstroke by Bill Broaddus,
and in the 20-yard butterfly and
200-yard breaststroke by co-captains
McManus and Jim Wallenstein.

Maryland Meet

At College Park the following af-
ternoon, the Generals seemed rattled
by the large crowd which saw the
home Terrapins take nine of eleven
firsts and shatter the pool record of
Navy for the 400-yard freestyle
relay in 3:19.6. Signs of travel fatigue
seemed evident in the times made by
the Generals which did not match
those of the day before. Maryland
swept all firsts and seconds through
the diving, but then let up by swim-
ming some of their entries unoffi-
| cially. Under these conditions, Wolfe
and Wallenstein took firsts in the
500-yard freestyle and 200-yard
breaststroke respectively.

Seconds were taken by Steve
Lunde in the 200-yard backstroke,
Wildrick in the 200-yard butterfly
and by Taylor in the 100-yard free-
style. The final score was 67-28 as
the University of Maryland stretched
its undefeated record to 11-0.

 

Trackmen Place

Sixth In State

By SPENCER ATWATER
Tuesday Sports Writer

In the Virginia State indoor track-
meet held at VMI Saturday, Wash-
ington and Lee gained sixth place
out of the thirteen competing col-
leges with Robin Kell leading the
Generals by scoring nine of W&L’s
team score of thirteen points.

Kell took first in the triple jump,
and a second in the high jump for
his nine points. Skip Essex was also
a mainstay of Washington and Lee’s
cindermen as he placed fourth in
the five-hundred yard dash and was
a member of W&L’s fourth place
mile relay team.

As Close Matches Decide

By LARRY CRAIG

The snow of last Saturday night prevented the referee
from arriving at the Washington and Lee-Franklin and Mar-
shall wrestling match. Coach Miller was forced into service and

experienced great frustration as he saw the Generals go down
to defeat at the hands of F&M, 19-9.*

Coach Miller, in his Monday

 

ansky of F&M. Dick Music over-

morning press conference, praised the
sportsmanship of the W&L wrestlers.
He pointed out that the boys did
not question his judgment on de-
cisions that may have been debat-
able.

Goldwater’s Thrust ‘Unavoidable’

(Continued from page 2)

the failure of the Democratic
administration since 1960 to provide
for the full participation of our al-
lies in the planning and deployment
of the most modern weapons sys-
tems, including appropriate nuclear
weapons.
The Democrats’ Isolationism

In this, the Democratic administra-
tion has been pursuing the most po-
tentionally disastrous course of iso-
lationism in our history, and no re-
sponsible Western leader has failed
to be alarmed by it. The American
people should be, too.”

Suggesting that tactical nuclear
weapons be made available to NATO,
Goldwater further said that, “so
long as Europeans feel that the U.S.
can veto the defense of their homes
by most modern weapons, they will
have reason to view the NATO al-
liance half in hope and half in fear.”

Mistaken he may be. But to evade
the thrust of his arguments by hid-
ing behind time-worn cliches, the
rhetoric of the doctrinaire, and the

got a point for one minute and two
seconds of riding time. For those

Ed Jansen was pinned as he in-
jured his leg while holding the ad-
vantage over Dave Donovan. Gen-

like the “Herbie of old”—radiated
confidence as he smashed John
Taylor, 11-4. Finally, Warren Stew-
art, giving away fifty pounds to Bill
Schnesderman, was pinned in the
third period.

The Generals will again be in ac-
tion Wednesday night at Hampden-
Sydney as they place their 5-3-1
record on the challenge line. The
team then returns home Saturday
to clash with Old Dominion College
in an eight o’clock match.

tactics of the name-caller is not
only intellectually dishonest, but a
fraud on the American people as
well.

A cancerous growth on a tiny
island in the Carribean is threaten-
ing daily to stretch its tenacles fur-
ther into Latin America while the
colossus of the North bumbles, fum-
bles, and fawns before the fuzzy-
faced Castro. We have no Cuban pol-
icy—at least no visible one. And our
Latin American policy makers are
mesmerized by their own grand-
iloquence while their Alliance for
Progress with all its nobility of pur-
pose offers too little, too late to a
fomenting continent.

Perceiving what he considers to
be a dire threat to this hemisphere,
as well as a terrific detriment to
our prestige that could be damag-
ing throughout the world, Senator
Goldwater has made some progres-
sive, affirmative suggestions that de-
serve our consideration.

Risk in Inaction

Of course, there is risk in action,

but so is there in inaction as to
which World War II is a bitter me-
morial. The negative policy of inac-
tion and compromise which we have
pursued with rare exceptions since
World War II has throughout history
resulted in either war or surrender.
In an effort to avoid this final choice
Barry Goldwater is challenging us
to think, to question, and to ponder
the policy and thus the future of the
West.
As is historically true with any
great or controversial figure many
sincerely disagree with him; many
abhor him; many do not understand
him; and many eagerly support him.
Honest men in all categories should
face the issues and ponder the
alternatives, not merely turn aside
with a shrug and a phrase to other
things.

 

Indoor Track Meet

Chris Kell were also members of the
Generals’ scoring relay team. Coach
Lord expressed satisfaction in the
track team’s showing since the Gen-
erals were competing against such
track powers as VMI, Virginia VPI
and William and Mary.

In the freshman competition, the
Baby Generals gained five points in
the meet for an overall team stand-
ing of ninth out of the thirteen other
freshman squads. John Graham led
the freshmen with a third place in
the pole vaulting event, while W&L’s
other two points came as Brian
Kendrich, Barry Vaught, Bob Big-
ham and Don Rogers combined to
bring Washington and Lee a fourth
place in the mile relay.

IFC Constitution Discussed

(Continued from page 1)

Fraternity allegiance makes the average house officer
slow to realize that the sum is greater than its parts, that more
is at stake than his particular chapter. Even more disconcerting
are the demanding, pseudo-democratic political parties. These
factors were responsible for the IFC breakdown in the mid-
1950’s. Presently fraternities are the only student activities
responsible to direct faculty control, excluding, of course,

scholarship.

Judicial Board Proposed
It would seem that the fraternity system can boast of little
if it can’t even govern itself. The proposed IFC Constitution

is a large step, but only a step,
terest is the ney Judicial Board

in this direction. Of major in-
with jurisdiction over rushing,

pledging, depledging, initiation and social functions of the
houses. Elaborate steps have been taken to circumvent the
problems of fraternity allegiance and politics.

The findings of the Judicial Board are subject to the ap-
proval of the Faculty Committee on Fraternities, as, indeed, is
the entire Constitution. In operation, the Judicial Board would
probably hand out a greater number of short-time penalties,

thus, hopefully, lessening the

incidence of severe penalties.

Similar bodies function efficiently and responsibly on many
other campuses in the nation. The Judicial Board concept is an
attempt at synthesizing the best from several of these systems

Much of the remainder of

the Constitution is concerned

with the mechanics of the IFC and would not make for pro-
vocative reading. Suffice it to say that public relations, academ-
ics, and social behavior are all dealt with, along with a multitude
of lesser problems. We are not attempting to say that our docu-
ment is a cure-all for the fraternity system. But it is a construc-
tive beginning upon which can be built a stronger and more

responsible system.

how the new act has failed to
achieve its expectations. In the first
round of negotiations with France,
the French proposed to lop off the
high tariffs. This was disadvantag-
eous to the US. since its tariffs re-
semble a wave, whereas the French
tariffs vary little. The U.S. pro-
posed that the low tariffs should be
raised to the average to compensate
for the lowered high tariffs, but it
was rejected by the French. Conse-

a bowling alley, restaurant, etc.,
he is not concerned with private
property; “it is public property,
licensed by the public—and Ne-
groes are a part of the public.”

Kilpatrick, in his closing remarks
before a question-answer period be-
gan, told the conference he thought
Farmer’s side would win the strug-
gle.

“He’s going to win. But what are
you going to lose? A loss of separa-
tion of power, states’ rights, and
property rights.”

Farmer countered with the com-
ment that “no one will lose but the
bigots.”

Both Kilpatrick and Farmer are
educated men, well-versed in cur-
rent affairs and highly respected.
Both are convinced of the truth of
their respective positions on civil
rights, and neither is likely to be
dissuaded.

If what Kilpatrick says—that the
Negroes will “win”’—is true, then
Americans are faced with what ap-
pears to be an insurmountable di-
lemma. Approximately one million
Americans hold the views of Mr.
Kilpatrick, and many of these may
lack his rationality and plain good
sense in coping with increased agi-
tation for racial integration.

derives from his over-concern for
Catherine,) However, this is, per-
haps, the finest real effort to com-
bine all the aspects of the cinema
into a truly full movie. Truffaut may
well be the cinema’s best artist.

I haven’t meant to slight “The
Prize,” but it simply cannot be com-
pared with “Jules and Jim.” How-
ever, it is quite entertaining, and
probably the equal of “Charade” in
its own way. It is an incredible sus-
pense drama, filled with amusing
scenes. Paul Newman _ illustrates
here that he is capable of light
comedy as well as heavy drama. And
Elke Sommer and Diane Baker pro-
vide the most beautiful twosome I
have seen in a single film. I recom-
mend this excellent action and ad-
venture drama to all those who go
to films simply for “entertainment.”

Lord of the Flies” comes to the
Lryic the same day that “The
Prize” opens at the State. I think
it might prove interesting to those
who have not read the Golding
novel, | am certain that it won’t
to those who have.
