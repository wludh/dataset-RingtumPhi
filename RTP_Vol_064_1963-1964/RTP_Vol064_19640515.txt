Debaters Select
Tri- Captains

Sam Frazier, Ed Fitzgerald, and
Rick Kneipper were named _ today
by debate coach William Chaffin as
the tri-captains of next year’s team.

The debate team closed out its
year Wednesday night with a din-
ner here. Alan Cohen and Bill
Grant were named the Outstanding
Freshman Debaters. Bill Noell, Al
Eckes, Jay Clark, Pete Straub,
Ed Norton and Jack Eure were
also honored for what Chaffin de-
scribed as being “pioneers of the
debate program at Washington and
Lee.”

Chaffin called the graduating sen-
iors the “end of a golden era.” It
was four years ago that Chaffin
came to Lexington and set up the
debate program. Since that time
W&L teams have risen to national
prominence, culminated by last
year’s appearance at the National
Finals.

“These six men have carried us
a long way and we're expecting
to go even further with the material
which is now available at W&L.
However, it must be remembered
that these men were largely re-
sponsible for creating the interest
which has acted as the stimulus for
debating here.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

“te Other Side Of The Coin

The Tuesday Edition of the Ring-tum Phi expressed some
concern over the ‘injustices” existing in the Honor System.
Our curiosity being aroused, we thought it best to consult with
those who are most intimately connected with the workings of
that System. Why is it that the members of the Executive Com-
mittee, those best understanding both the workings and the
effects of the Honor System, are consistently so adamant in

its defense?

In order to best answer this question, we investigated the
reasons which lead the Executive Committee to maintain the
Honor System as it now stands. Their opinion is doubtless the

most valid and authoritative.

It is, first of all, unrealistic to expect the EC to judge
whether a man is basically dishonest or not, or whether one
dishonest person is more dishonest than another. How can
they know whether a person who has cheated “impulsively”
on one test has not done so innumerable times? Is it fair to
leave such a subjective and unanswerable question up to the

EC?

Certainly the EC doesn’t judge any cases where the evi-
dence supplied is insufficient or indefinite. The individual mem-
bers of the Committee go through a great deal of personal
soul-searching and careful examination of the evidence before
they pass a verdict on any accused student, realizing the severi-
ty of of the penalty. The result is that it will not pronounce
a student guilty unles it is sure beyond any doubt that its deci-

sion is valid.

Before the incoming student reaches W&L he is fully in-
formed of the workings of the system, its consequences, and
its benefits. The Honor System is emphasized again at fresh-
man camp and during the first week of classes. All students
know what W&L’s Honor System is and how it operates. There
is no doubt in their minds of the consequences of a breach

of the honor code.

The Honor System is an integral part of the meaning
of Washington and Lee University. We are now one of the
few schools in the country where the Honor System has worked
with such effective results. We are known throughout the coun-
try for our workable system of maintaining honor. Because it
is one chief reason why many students come to W&L and be-
cause it is such a deeply meaningful institution, we certainly
should not jeopardize this status.

It must be remembered that expulsion from W&L is not
the same as capital punishment. Students who are expelled
from W&L are able to gain admission to other fine universities,

such as Tulane or Dartmouth.

The Honor System as it presently stands has the
ability to maintain a sense of honor and dignity. Any-
thing that would mitigate this ability would be detri-
mental, if not fatal, to the Honor System. A weaker
Honor System might result in no Honor System at all

In conclusion, we must agree with the Tuesday Edition
that the Honor System is rigid. However, it is this very
rigidity that has put our university in a class by itself as far
as the average Honor System is concerned.

In considering the Honor System, we must not
dwell merely on its negative aspect. Indeed, the issue of
the “fallen man” sinks to an infintestimal level of un-
importance when we consider the benefits that are de-
rived from W&L’s most living tradition.

Eight & A Half’ Presents
A Self Portrait Of Fellini

By BOB MOTTLEY

Frederico Fellini’s 84% opens Sun-
day at the Lyric; it is fitting to be
able to devote all of this last
column of the semester to one of the
very greatest per-
sonal _testaments
ever issued by
any artist in any
aesthetic medium.

Fellini tells the
story of one
Guido  Anselmi,
an internationally
known Italian
cinema director
who has reached
a period of artist-
ic frigidity. He
goes to a famous vacation center
noted for its thermal baths, where
he tries to “find himself.” This is
made rather difficult by the presence
of virtually his entire retinue of ac-
tors, technicians, public relations
men, lawyers, and assorted parasites
all hoping to be a part of his new
film.

Unfortunately, Anselmi is as
much in the dark as they are
about what his new movie will be,
although his producer is also vat
this spa, constantly prodding him
and telling him to get on with it,
to get something in the can. The
director’s mistress is along for

   

Mottley

 

fun and games, and even his wife
eventually turns up, although she
is surprisingly tolerant (by Ameri-
can standards) of her husband’s
observance of that good, old-
fashioned Double Standard.
Caught between ennui and apathy,
Anselmi frees himself from the
assorted frustrations at hand by
clever daydreams, He is caught in
a traffic jam, and then arises from
his car like a god to his hotel
bed.

A particularly obnoxious writer
makes one suggestion too many
and—in the director’s dream—is
hanged on the spot! (A device that
might be imitated with profit in
Hollywood). These dreams are very
much a part of the film’s fabric, and,
in the end, Anselmi learns to live
with his past and with the dramatis
personae of his life dancing around
him as if in a cireus ring. In the
love-filled final scene, his people
(wife, mistress, actors, technicans
even writers) become his perform-
ers, and he makes his aesthetic
peace with his artistic self.

Breathtaking to Watch

One does not have to know so
much of what is said in 8% as what
is done. The film is breathtaking to
watch, a virtuosic tour de force of
the first order. So fluid does the

Durrette Analyzes Tuesday Editorial

 

By WYATT DURRETTE

In Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi the
editorial “The Risks in a Goldwater
nomination” is addressed to several
points, two of which require fur-
their comment and analysis.

First is the assertion that since
California’s primary had been won
by Rockefeller we should not have
“in the Arizona Senator’s own
opinion. ..nominated him.”

California

As the editorial indicated Gold-
water did place his political pres-
tige on the line in California. But
this was on the assumption that
Governor Rockfeller and his sup-
porters would conduct a campaign
befitting a presidential aspirant; he
assumed that his record and his
ideas would be the subject of honest
debate and not the victim of the
“Big Lie” and bought votes.

But his assumptions are false.
Governor Rockefeller with the as-
sistance of Spencer-Roberts—the
biggest and best public relations
firm in the political campaign
buisness—have adopted tactics
designed to win no matter the
price: in dollars, in careers, or
in integrity,

Without great elaboration one tac-
tic should suffice to sound the
nature of their methodology. Spen-
cer-Roberts & Co. successfully re-

By KEN McGRAW

There are a number of things
which are synonymous with Spring
at W&L, but none is any more
closely associated with it than the
White’s Farm Carnival.

The carnival itself belongs to the
Borelli brothers, Jim and Louis
(neither of which is Tanya’s hus-
band despite popular opinion). Both
are very amiable people as is their
manager, Mr. Lewis. Mr. Lewis has

 

 

registered over 70,000 Negroes from
Democratic to Republican in order
that they could vote for Governor
Rockefeller on June 2.

If this and other similar tac-
tics, including a gigantic smear
campaign, should succeed in de-
feating Goldwater in California he
would hardly conclude that he
does not deserve the nomination.

It is my understanding that less
than 200 delegates remain to be
chosen after the June 2 primary. A
Rockefeller victory in California
could, depending on the state, have
an impact on these selections. But
as to the ones already picked, and
those to be chosen between now
and then, the influence of it is
speculative.

From conversations with Mock
Convention state chairmen I have
concluded that most of those
whose states are questionable made
every effort to assimilate the Cal-
ifornia results with their other
findings. Many telephoned and
asked directly: “How will a Rock-
efeller victory in California af-
fect my state’s voting?”

I am not sufficiently appraised
of the situation state by state to
know in which state or states we
were worn, if at all. But I vigorous-
ly disagree with the intimation that
our state chairmen intentionally

had the misfortune though of spend-
ing forty-seven years of his life in
work that he doesn’t enjoy—the
carnival. “There is one good thing
about it though,” he said, “I’ve spent
forty-seven years of my life in this
business, started out in Richmond
in 1916 with a job in concessions,
I sold hotdogs then, and I have
never once had to work for any-
one but myself.”

New Skin Show

By DREW BAUR

Oh, joy, the skin show is here.
My, there are some choice goodies
this year.

The most obvious change to the
casual observer is the addition of
a third show. Since this show is
the newest, it would be best to
give it the initial analysis. The act
is longer, the jokes are better, but
the girlies are worse. Vicky was
a welcome addition with her sen-
suous curves, but hardly in a class
with the sexy Tanya or the sultry
Faye. Of the other three, one looked
faintly like the chief prop in the
flick Moby Dick; one appeared to
have spent a good deal of time
under the knife, and the third prob-
ably remembers voting for William
Jennings Bryan.

The worst of the shows is a one
beast operation run by Stella the
Blond Bombshell, a real piece of
donkey. Her subtle approach to the
strip leaves most onlookers non-
chalantly tossing their proverbial
cookies, instead of leaping up and
down with excitement.

Most people save the leaping for
Tanya. In two years she has estab-

 

 

Added To Fair;

Vicky Not In A Class With Tanya

lished herself as a legend in these
parts with her sexy dance and good
looks. It is not necessary to go into
a more detailed description. This
year Tanya was joined full time by
Faye, a voluptuous redhead who has
adorned the pages of the Southern
Collegian. She has acquired far more
poise in the past year, but is not
yet quite as promiscuous as the
talented, well-endowed Tanya.
Flick Team

The time has come to choose the
1963-1964 All-Star Flick Team. This
year four flickers stood out so far
above all the rest that it would be
unfair to place anyone in the same
catageory with them. The first All-
Star is the nortorious Kappa Sig,
Tom Pace, who leger.d claims, went
to New York for three days, saw
nine flicks and returned. Two D.C,
flickers, Frank Wright, a Sigma Nu,
and PiKA, Dick Goode, join Alan
Hubbard, a KA junior, to round out
a balanced squad.

Goldwater—Victim Of The

failed to evaluate their states in
light of the California decision.
They could, you know, be right—
mechanically and predictively.

Acceptable to All?
Second, I will examine the asser-
tion that Goldwater is “not accept-
able to all Republicans.” Who is?
Was John Kennedy acceptable to
“all” Democrats?

That New York Senator Jacob
Javits will not support Senator
Goldwater is not surprising, but
Javits is hardly a representative
of a significant body of Republicans.
He has the lowest ACA (conserva-
tive) voting percentage of any Re-
publican Senator and is one of 7
with a percentage below 50 per
cent. These 7 have the dubious dis-
tinction of accompanying 54 Dem-
ocrats in the less that 50 per cent
club. While only 4 Democrats rate
above 70 per cent, 12 Republicans,
including Senator Goldwater, stand
above this mark.

It does not, then, seem particu-
larly disturbing that Senator Javitts’
affections may be alienated by Gold-
water’s nomination as he represents
a small minority of Republicans.

Polls—Chaos or Certainty?
What about the polls? In April,
1963 the Gallup Poll reported that
Governor Rockefeller was the fav-
orite of 43 per cent of the Repub-
licans; by November, 1963 Senator

relli's and Mr. Lewis begins in
April. Starting in South Carolina
they work their way north to Penn-
sylvania. By this time it is August
and time for the carnival to go back
south for its November closing in
Nacoy, Florida. The reason that
Lexington is on their schedule is
that it is a convenient stopping
place. Mr. Borelli hastened to add
though that he certainly didn’t mind
stopping the carnival here, because
the students were pretty good cus-
tomers, This statement brought us
back to the topic of the skin show.
He couldn’t estimate the amount
students spend at these shows, but
it seems logical to me that if you
multiplied 1200 by three you would
be pretty close.

For those who are waiting until
the last minute to go, there are
three “strip shows” and seven girls.
The Borelli’s object, though, to the
title of strip show. “It’s not a strip
show” said Mr. Borelli. “It’s a re-
view, burlesque. There’s an art to it.
The dance that these girls do is a
form of expression, there’s nothing
cheap about it. A perfect woman’s
body is a beautiful thing,” he con-
tinued. “Take the Mona Lisa, for
example. Why do you think every-
body raves about her?” I answered
Mr. Borelli that I might just be
unappreciative, but that the sight of
four of the seven of those girls
wasn’t very appealing to any of
my senses, especially not the
aesthetic one,

Girl’s Married

By way of general information
on these girls, Mr. Borelli added
that all of them were married.
When asked if their husbands
didn’t mind, he seemed to think that
it was a ridiculous question to ask.
He answered me by asking if a wife
of a plumber minds the fact that
her husband works in toilet bowls.

Another very interesting man to
talk to out at the fair is Lou Pease.
He and his wife Kitty run the show
featuring the legless, armless, bone-
less creature. He has done real
well with this show and plans to
open another tonight which will be
called the Thing. From the build-up
which he gave this show it sounds
like a must. “The Thing is best de-
scribed as a_ hairy protoplasmic
creature with arms,” he explained.

Lou Pease, like Mr. Lewis has
been with the carnival all his life,
but unlike him, he is there because
he enjoys it. Last year Lou quit the
carnival life and bought a house
on Long Island. As soon as spring
came though, he sold the house
and went back to his gypsy’s life
with the carnival. One of the reasons
that he likes it so much is that
he has the ability to fool people, and
as he put it, “People like to be
fooled.”

In two days the carnival will be
leaving Lexington. If you haven't
seen it yet, the only thing that you
have missed are Tanya, Vicki, Faye,
and Lou’s hairy piece of protoplasm.
Of course you might be one of those
people who enjoy being fooled in
which case you could have a field
day at White’s farm.

 

‘Big Lie’
Goldwater had captured 45 per cent
of their hearts; March of 1964 found
Mr. Nixon in command of 34 per
cent of the Republican voters; and
in April, 1964 Mr. Lodge was firmly
entrenched as the favorite of 42
per cent. Conclusion? I give up!

That the press has treated
Goldwater unmercifully cannot
be denied. Goldwater wins by 9
to 1 in Texas, and Lodge’s write-
in is significant; Lodge wins 7 to
1 over Goldwater in Mass., his
home state, and it’s a smashing
victory; Stassen gets 27 per cent
of the Republican vote in Indiana,
and Goldwater is repudiated—
Wallace gets 31 per cent of the
Democratic vote, same state, same
day, and it’s a dramatic affirma-
tion of President Johnson.

In 1960 Kennedy was “triumphant”
ly” victorious with “landside” victor-
ies in Oregon (51.1 per cent of the
vote), West Virginia (60.8 per cent),
Wisconsin (58 per cent). However,
Senator Goldwater’s victories in
1964 are “discouraging” and “disap-
pointing” (accurate maybe for New
Hampshire) when he wins by 50
per cent (Nebraska), 67 per cent
(Indiana), 64.5 per cent (illinois),
and 78.6 per cent (Texas). One
wonders.

Of course Barry Goldwater will
not be acceptable to Jacob Javitts,
but neither was John Kennedy ac-
ceptable to Harry Byrd. But the
Democrats nominated John Kenne-
dy, and he won.

To speak of a Goldwater mas-
sacre in November is premature

EpitoR

To Whom it may concern:

We, as freshmen, hearing before
our arrival at this university of
the fabulous entertainment that our
school is famous for, would like to
congratulate this year’s Dance Board
for a highly successful year. We,
honestly could not have asked for
better entertainment for our $30.00
investment.

The year got off on the right
foot with a sensational performance
by Lloyd “Mr. Dynamic” Price at
Openings Dance, as he _horse-
laughed his way through Misty ap-
proximately five times too many.
However, this amazing performance
was followed by the internationally
famous recording group, The Up-
setters, at the next night’s con-
cert. Who will ever be able to for-
get the standing ovation given after
a thought provoking rendition of
Monkey Man? ’Tis a shame that as
good a performer as Roy Hamilton
had to appear on the same stage
as the previously mentioned “enter-
tainers”!

 

 

The greatest college weekend in
the South (Fancy Dress; what else?)
was a fantistic Dance Board suc-
cess at both the dance and the
concert. The music of Stan Rubin
and his band was as potent as the
drinks being served. However, every
performance ever given at W&L
must take a back seat to the bril-
liant concert at this year’s F.D. As
has happened at many of her pre-
vious engagements, Dakota Staton
“thank you’ed” the audience to
their feet and right out the door to
the fraternity parties.

Springs was another outstanding
Success. Despite playing on an un-
tuned piano, and before an unre-
ceptive audience, Dave Brubeck
and his group gave a rather lack-
luster performance. The next night’s
concert was a highlight of the year
also. The Dance Board managed to
keep the audience on the edges of
their seats with a well coordinated
and well executed concert. The
Chiffons were great, if you could
hear them. The Crystals were great
in both of the numbers they did.
The Five Royals were great for
fifty-year-old men trying to act
like the infamous Beatles, The one
good performance of the evening
was beyond the planning of the
Dance Board, that is, the accidental
appearance of the Delicardos.

Once again the Board has done
it. The students learned Wednesday
evening of the forthcoming appear-
ance of the Serendipity Singers, a
poor imitation of the New Christy
Minstrels, who are poor imitations of
folk singers.

We wonder who will be contracted
next? Rudy Vallee, The Trashman,
or The Tide Family?

Fourth-Ranked U-Va
Defeats Generals 12-3

By BRUCE GARRETT
Virginia’s Cavaliers maintained their number four national
ranking easily yesterday by downing the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team 12-3 at Charlottesville.
The Generals, playing their last game of the season, never
really had a chance as Virginia took control of the game in
the first quarter and never lost the initiative.

The balance of the Cavalier attack*

is indicated by the game’s leading
scorer (Virginia’s second midfielder
Boyce) had only two goals.

MIS V BS. ssisssssisiscsssssisaasdassisssiesovind 2613—12
W&L

The Generals were shut out until
the third quarter when Bob Os-
troff finally scored on a fine four-
on-three fast break with Duncan
Lamounte getting the assist.

The other General goals came in
the fourth quarter by Randay Woot-
ton, assisted by Mike Michaeles, and
by Bob Frost.

W&L goalie Pete Noonan made 13
saves, while the Cavaliers’ probable
All-American goalie Shreeve only
played in the first half, making 5
saves. Virginia’s sophomore goalie
Brandt who played in the second
half showed great potential and
ended up with 12 saves.

Virginia’s attackmen McGill and
Davies were, as expected, excellent
feeders; and the crease attackman
Peterson also did an outstanding job.

Johnny McDaniel turned in an
excellent performance for the Gen-
erals, gathering in twelve ground
balls.

Washington and Lee thus finishes
its season with a 5-4 record, precise-
ly what was predicted at the be-
ginning of the season.

Season standouts in scoring were
midfielder attackman John McDan-
iel with nineteen goals followed by
attackman Mike Michaeles_ with
thirteen goals. Carroll Klingelhofer
led the Generals in assists for the
season with eighteen.

Phi Kap To Take I-M Trophy;
Participation Cited As Key

By JIM BUSSART

The W&L sports program is just
about over for another year. For
some teams, it has been a success,
for others, perhaps a disappointment.
The Phi Kap story is one of suc-
cess.

Thursday the three major sports
trophies will be awarded at Coach
Mac’s annual sports banquet. Two,
and very likely three of these tro-
phies will be given to John Beagle
intramural manager of Phi Kappa
Sigma.

The Phi Kaps have sewn up the
intramural trophy this year, with a
point total of 1301, the highest ever
achieved since the inception of the
revised point system in the early
50's.

Delt Leads

In the intercollegiate trophy race,
the results will be very close. Per-
rennial champ Delta Tau Delta held
a slim 18 point lead over the Phi
Kap’s going into the spring sport
schedule of tennis, golf, baseball,
track and lacrosse, but Phi Kap
should get close to full participation
in each of these. The final results
will not be known until next week.

The grand athletic trophy has al-

most surely been won by Phi Kappa
Sigma, although this is unofficial
because the final results have not
yet been announced. With their
strong lead in intramurals and at
least second place in_ intercolle-
giate competition, the Phi Kap’s are
almost incontestably the grand ath-
letic winners of 1963-64.

The Phi Kap’s won four first place
trophies in intramural competition—
swimming, cross-country, ping pong
and track. They also took two sec-
onds and a fourth.

INTRAMURAL YEAR
A FEATHER IN THE PLD LAP

By TOM WHITE

Phi Kappa Sig, with champion-
ships in four sports, has apparently
upset the defending champ Delt
in the race for the school’s athletic
championship. The Phi Kap’s took
firsts in swimming, the turkey trot,
track, and table tennis while adding
second place finishes in bowling and
tennis.

While losing their championship,
the Delts did take two firsts, in hand-
ball and softball. Beta, standing only
in sixth place over-all, also won

two championships, copping the
honors in football and tennis.
Fall Sports

In marching to their winning ef-
fort, Phi Kap got off to a good start
when they took two firsts and a sec-
ond in the fall sports. They opened
the season with a second place ef-
fort in tennis, behind winning Beta.
Phi Delt finished third for the sec-
ond straight year, and Delt was
fourth.

Then the attention shifted to golf
where Phi Delt moved up from third
place last year to take the title this
year. Following the Phi Delt’s were
Kappa Sig, Pi Phi, and Sigma Nu.

Touch football was next, and here
Beta took their first championship,
edging out the Law school. Follow-
ing behind the top two were SPE
and Phi Gam.

The Phi Kaps moved out in front
of the pack as the next two sports
were completed. They took firsts in
the turkey trot and swimming.

Led by John Laimbeer, the Phi
Kap team swept by Lambda Chi,
Phi Psi, and SAE in the turkey trot.
In swimming, the Phi Kap team
piled up the most participation,
meet, and board points of any team
entered to walk away with the title.

Winter Sports

The Phi Kap lead was threatened
with the completion of the winter
sports which gave Delt and SAE,
currently fifth place overall, big
boosts.

The winter season opened with
wrestling of which KA became I-M
champ. Finishing behind it were
Sigma Chi, DU (fourth last year),
and Beta.

Turning to bowling, Kappa Sig,
behind Tom Pace, took its first
championship, edging the defending
champion Phi Kap’s in a close match.
SAE took third and Phi Delt fourth.

For the second straight year, SAE
wound up winning basketball, but
not before battling Beta in a hard
fought final game. Sigma Nu, sec-

fer, fourth.

It was the Delts turn next. In a
tight three-team battle for first
place, the Delts won handball when
they downed a KA team that had
earlier defeated them. Beta was third
and PiKA again fourth.

Spring Sports

Both Phi Kap and Delt did well
in the spring sports.

Phi Kap opened with two quick
victories, padding their lead over the
Delts. Winning table tennis, the Phi
Kap’s faced tough competition from
ZBT, defending champ DU, and
Sigma Nu. In winning the annual
track meet, Phi Kap was followed
by Delt, SAE and Lambda Chi.

ZBT moved into third place over-
all when they won the I-M volley-
ball title. DU, second last year, came

in second again this year while
Delt was third and Phi Kap was
fourth.

In action completed last week,
Delt gained 25 points on Phi Kap
by taking the softball title on the
strong pitching arm of Fred Schaef-
fer. ZBT virtually clinched third
place over-all with their second
place finish. Beta and PiKA tied for
third.

Perhaps the most unusual occur-
rence of the year was the big dif-
ference in Beta’s athletic and intra-
mural totals. The Beta’s finished in
16th place in intercollegiate ath-
letics, while taking second in I-M
totals. Phi Kap led in I-M totals
with Beta second and Delt third.
In intercollegiate, Delt leads, Phi
Kap is in second, and ZBT is third.

TO THE TUESDAY sports page
which has, self-admittedly, the best
sports news on campus: Glad you
pointed out our errors of Friday
last. We checked with cartoonist
Apgar, discovered Southwestern
was indeed in the bell (Freudian
symbolism and all that).

As for the typographical error,
you might consider La Chausee’s
statement, “When everyone is in
the wrong, everyone is in the
right.”

Criticism is, after all, what we
say about other people who don’t
have the same faults we do.

IN JANUARY we began a week-
ly intramural column justified, we
felt, by the percentage of the stu-
dent body taking part in the pro-
gram.

This week we devote nearly an
entire page to intramurals, while
announcing intramural participa-
tion has jumped nearly 10 per cent
above last year.

Intramural reporter Tom White
includes his interpretation of the
year, with another cartoon by Gar-
ry Apgar (Tuesday will wonder
why KA is missing). We also got
Phi Kap Jim Bussart to write of
his fraternity’s triumph.

SEVEN hundred eighty-eight of
1,163 students took part in the 1963-
64 program, 68 per cent of the stu-
dent body as opposed to 58.4 per
cent last year.

More students participated this
year than any year previous, al-
though 1957-58, with 69.6, had a
higher percentage. For the first
time since 1960 participation pass-
ed the 60 per cent level.

The three major sports—football,
softball and basketball—had the
highest totals of individual partici-
pants, football with 374, softball with
271, and basketball with 224.

cinema medium become in Fellini’s
hands that the viewer begins to
identify immediately with the pre-
dicament of Anselmi; making crea-
tive frustration stick with a generally
non-creative audience is no mean
trick.

The title is not the only proof
that Anselmi is a close portrait
of Fellini himself, (Fellini has sev-
en major films and three short
subjects—hence “eight and one-
half”) there are little personal
touches in every frame that stamp
this film with the leving concern
of a great artist who wants very
much to express what it is like to
be himself, not from any sense of
ego, but so that others may recog-
nize in his own weaknesses and
triumphs something of themselves.
This is a high and noble (as well
as difficult) task, and Fellini has
succeeded brilliantly. There is a
quiet grandeur about 812 that sim-
ply transcends comment.

zo the film editor. Marcello Mastro-
ianni is superb as the hamstrung
director; Sandra Milo makes a se-
ductive mistress, Anouk Aimee, an
understanding wife. The large com-
pany is cast perfectly down to the
most inconsequential parts; surely
no one will forget the appearance of
Edra Gale as the fat whore Saraghi-
na, who has no alternative in life
but to dance grotesquely on a beach
for the amusement of children.

Throughout the year we have
predicted consistently that the in-
ternational cinema was not the
dreary farce suggested by Holly-
wood products, and that one would
do well to cultivate an apprecia-
tion of the more important for-
eign directors. Thanks to the vital
interest of Mr. Side, we have had
ample opportunity to study the
work of Bergman, Visconti, An-
tonioni, Bourguignon, Forbes, and
Richardson (before Tom Jones).
Now in this magnificent film of
Fredrico Fellini, the semester can
truly end on a golden note. 8!2
is not the last word, of course, but
it is a splendid example of a man
of genius using his talents to con-
sumate advantage.

an amateurish. To visualize a
hopelessly divided Republican
Party is to give credence to a
myth—a myth perpetrated by lib-
eral columnists and East Coast
Republicans who refuse to allow
the Control of the Republican
Party to slip from their grasp. The
preservation of liberalism in the
GOP is the self-appointed task of
numerous pubdits before they ral-
ly ‘round the Democratic flag each
election year.

If by such tactics (and who else
but Barry could cop the TW-3
“nomination”) they can “seare” the

Party out of nominating a conserva-
tive—if there were no Goldwater,
they would lambast Nixon—the vic-
tory is their’s without a shot being
fired.

Maybe it would be a mistake for
the GOP to nominate Goldwater be-
cause of the damage an alleged hu-
miliating defeat would do to the
Party. I honestly don’t know. But
the criticism should not be directed
at the Senator and his supporters
for their quest of the prize, but

Maybe Walter Lippman, Joseph,
