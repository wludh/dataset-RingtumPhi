‘Ariel’ Enters
Second Year

By BILL CHAPLIN

The autumn issue of Ariel, which
was delayed at the printer's during
December, is now on sale at the Co-
op and at the Book Shop. This issue
is the first of three issues to be pub-
lished this year, the next two issues
coming in March and in May.

The present issue is an expanded
and radically revamped version of
the attempts last year to publish
a worthwhile student literary mag-
azine. The new issue is fifty pages
long, and contains short stories,
poetry, and book reviews. Four of
the works came from Hollins, Ran-
dolph-Macon, and Mary Baldwin,
and editor Bill Kinsey hopes to con-
tinue the trend, begun last year, to
publish contributions from nearby
schools. Ariel remains, however, a
W&L literary magazine.

The response to calls for manu-
scripts early in the fall was sur-
prisingly good, and a number of
fine works could not be published

several short stories were submitted
that were fully drawn even while
they were not so long as to domi-
nate an entire issue ,and six of these
were selected for this issue. Their
range in style and subject matter is
broad.

Steve Henry’s At Six on a Sun-..
day Morning is a funny story, told
with an ironic realistic description
that cloaks the absurdity of his
main character, who is naked in
a public phone booth near a lake
out of which he has brought two
mallard ducks. Robert Mac Rives’
Slippery Hips is lyrical and Joyce-
an and relies much on fantasy for
its effectiveness. Sarah Gordon's
story is wildly impresisonistic. Tom
Goar, Susie McGown, Bill Kinsey
and Anton Devreau_ contribute
stories whose style is more tradi-
tional.

There is also a wide range of
poetry, some of it serious in its treat-
ment of subjects, and some of it
comic or ironic, contributed by Bill
Chaplin, Rod Cockshutt, Dina Coe,
Theodore Hirschfield, Bill Kinsey,
and Rodney Stump. The reviews by
Rod Cockshutt and Llewellyn Smith
are of two recent and important
books by Cleanth Brooks and Jean
Genet.

Ariel hopes to find among its con-
tributions for the next issue (dead-
line for submitting manuscripts is
February 15) outstanding essays,
which published, would be of inter-
est to the liberal arts student. This
would expand the scope of the mag-
azine to include both imaginative fic-
tion and imaginative essays of more
than routine interest.

In this way, Ariel hopes to fulfill
a need, to bridge the gap between
Shenandoah, whose function is to
publish professional writing and
criticism, and the Southern Colle-
gian.

Humphrey Finishes Fall Series
With Analysis Of Southerners

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Last night in Lee Chapel,
William Humphrey gave his
fourth and concluding speech
as this term’s Glasgow Visiting
Professor.

Mr. Humphrey did not lec-
ture on a literary topic. “I have been
straining myself,” he explained, “as
a literary critic, which I am not.”

Instead, he read part one of his
forthcoming novel, Look Away, Look
Away, a study of Southern psychol-
ogy in novel form. In part one, en-
titled “In a Country Churchyard,”
Mr. Humphrey attempts to explain
the Southerner’s preoccupation with
the past, particularly in regard to the
War Between the States. He illus-
trates this preoccupation by creat-
ing the character of a Southerner
raised in a rural community and by
having him tell of his experiences as
a small boy in the first person.

The locality in which Look Away,
Look Away is set is a fictitious town
in East Texas. The town, Clarkville,

 

Lukacs Discusses

Cold Warfare

John Lukacs, a leading authority
on Eastern Europe, the Cold War,
and publie opinion, will speak at
Washington and Lee University
Thursday, January 16, on the sub-
ject, “From Cold War to Cold
Peace—the End of Ideology?

Appearing under the auspices of
the Department of Journalism and
Communications, Lukacs will address
the class in Psychological Warfare
and Propaganda, in which one of
his books, “A History of the Cold
War,” has been required reading.
The class meets at 11:10 a.m. in the
Journalism Lecture Room, Payne
Hall 6. The meeting is open to the
public.

Lukaes, who has degrees from
Cambridge and Budapest universi-
ties ,has been professor of history
at Chestnut Hill College, Philadel-
phia, since 1947; visiting professor at
La Salle College since 1949; visiting
professor, Columbia University, 1954-
55; Honors’ Examiner at Swarthmore
College, 1963; and will be visiting
professor at the University of Penn-
sylvania in 1964.

His three published books are
“The Great Powers and Eastern
Europe,” an edition of Tocqueville’s
papers, and a “History of the Cold
War,” which has also appeared in
German, French, Spanish, and Ital-
ian translations. Two new books,
“Historical Thinking,” and “The
Question of Europe,” will appear in
1964. He is the author of numerous
articles published in American and
English historical and literary jour-
nals, including “Poker and Amer-
ican Character” in the current issue
of Horizon magazine.

Lukaes was born in Hungary and
came to the United States in 1946.

He lives with an American wife and |
his son in a remodeled old school-'

house in Chester County, Pa.

is in a region where the land and
climate make it a part of the South
rather than the West. Clarksville is
a typical Southern county seat, with
its locally impressive courthouse, set
in a square in the center of town,
and surmounted by a statue of a
Confederate soldier.

“Graveworking Day”

The narrator talks of himself as a
small boy growing up in this small
Southern town and of the annual
family reunions on “graveworking
day.” Customarily, this is the day
when all the clan gathers to tend
the ancestral graves and reverently
recount cherished anecdotes of its
deceased ancestors. In the narrator’s
family, long dead predecessors are
kept alive in spirit in the memories
of their living successors. The nar-
rator repeats the stories, good and
bad, with great devotion and pride
even for those ancient relatives that
he never knew.

Identity With the Past

In this attachment to forefathers
and kin lies the explanation for the
chronological backwardness of the
South, contended Mr. Humphrey in
summary. “We Southerners are ac-
cused of living in the past—What
can we do? The past lives in us.”
The influence of ancestors prevails
with Southerners because they have

 

an innate feeling of identity with

their dead. This sense of identity is
the source of most of the distinctly
Southern characteristics: legalism,
disrespect for the law (which is
imposed by a conqueror), resistence
to change, veneration of old age, re-
ligious feelings, ties of kinship, etc.

Civil War Still Vital

The war Between the States still
has a vital and vivid meaning to
the Southerner, says Mr. Humprey.
The Southerner is conscious of the
fact that the blood flowing in his
veins is the same blood that was
spilled at Shiloh. He thinks of the
Battle of Bull Run not in terms of
a great Southern victory but in
terms of the place where his great-
grandfather fought.

War For the Dead?

According to Mr. Humphrey, the
average Southerner went to war in
1861 not for a cause, as did the
Notherner, but for the few acres of
land constituting the resting place
of the family dead. He did not fight
to preserve slavery, which he de-
spised, or for his country, which
was only a few months old and a
“union of disunion.”

Mr. Humphrey’s narrative style is
gripping and brilliant. The reader is
quickly led to identify with the nar-
rator, and the series of anecdotes
is fascinating in the characters they
portray.

 

This winter’s Fancy Dress Ball
promises to be one of the gayest and
most colorful in recent years, due to
the Mardi Gras theme and the ap-
pearance of Stan Rubin’s dance or-
chestra and the two gospel singing
groups: the Grandison Singers and
the Sweet Chariot Singers.

The Ball has always been a cos-
tume affair, and this one will be no
exception. Although the number of
costumes sold to date is low, many
students are expected to make their
own. This originality is encouraged,
provided that the costumes are com-
patable with the formal ballroom at-
mosphere of the dance, but the dance
officials wish to stress that the set-
ting is not that of a street dance,
and that sloppy or overly suggestive
costumes will not be permitted, nor
will tuxedoes, but that full dress
(white tie and tails) will be accept-
able in the old tradition of the Mardi
Gras Ball, one of the most formal
social events in the South.

Steve Hibbard, Vice-president of
the Dance Board, has announced
that costumes, including full dress,
will be on sale for the last time on
Monday, January 13, from 9:30 to
5:00, except during the lunch hour,

 

 

The price of a single costume is $8, |
and a pair for a student and his date |
will cost $14.

These prices represent a_ saving |
of over $4 from last year, and|
though either a long or short formal |
is aceptable for the girls, it is hoped|
i that many of them will also be in|

The Ball will be held in Evans
Dining Hall, where the figure will
start promptly at 9:00 p.m. Stan Ru-

an intermission at 10:30, during
which the two gospel groups will

Gaines Dies

At 71; Last Rites
Held In Chapel

By STEVE BRAUER
Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines, Chancellor and past presi-
dent of Washington and Lee University, died of an apparent
heart attack at his home December 31. Exactly two weeks
prior to his death, Dr. Gaines addressed the student body at an
ODK Tap Day ceremony where he received standing ovations

 

Scholarship Aids
Hit Record High

The amount of financial aid Wash-
ington and Lee University awards
undergraduates has climbed to a new
high in the current 1963-64 session.

Dean Lewis John, Director of Fi-
nancial Aid at Washington and Lee,
reports 246 students are receiving
$191,365 in assistance.

This total compares with $154,119
awarded 200 students in the 1960-61
session—the first year of the univer-
sity’s expanded financial aid pro-
gram whose purpose is to make
Washington and Lee education avail-
able to all qualified high school stu-
dents, regardless of their financial
limitations.

The program gives assistance in
the form of a scholarship, loan,
campus job or any combination of
the three. Dean John says a majority
of students receiving aid this year
are being helped through a scholar-
ship-loan combination.

Repayment of loans does not begin
until a student graduates, enabling
him to pay part of the cost of his
college education when his earning
power is established. All loans are
from university sources.

Washington and Lee students also
earn part of the expense of their
education through campus jobs as
dining hall workers, dormitory
counselors or helpers in the office
of academic departments and ad-
ministration officials.

The two top financial aid awards
Washington and Lee gives are the
George F. Baker Scholarships and
the Robert E. Lee Scholarships.

Dates From 1960

A gift from the George F. Baker
Trust of New York City established
the Baker Scholarships at Washing-
ton and Lee in 1960. In the current
sesison, six freshmen and 10 upper-
classmen are sharing $16,800.

The Robert E. Lee Scholarship
Fund was established in 1955 with
a $200,000 gift from an anonymous
donor. Including four freshmen, a
total of 21 undergraduates are re-
ceiving $13,600 from the fund this
year.

Financial aid given by Washing-
ton and Lee is awarded on the basis
of merit and need. In considering a
student for financial assistance, Dean
John says a boy’s academic record
and potential for development are
considered along with his need for
assistance in meeting expenses.

The actual amount of aid given
is determined by procedures adopted
by 516 institutions participating in
the College Scholarship Service. This
includes consideration of a family’s
income, assets, number of depen-
dents, debts and all unusual ex-
penses.

Gaines’ Education

Dr. Gaines’ career as the outstand-
ing Southern educator, orator, and
scholar of his day began in Due
West, South Carolina, where Dr.
Gaines was born on April 21, 1892,
the son of a Baptist minister. Fol-
lowing his graduation from Fork
Union Military Academy in 1909, he
received his A.B. from the Univer-
sity of Richmond, his A.M. from
the University of Chicago and his
Ph.D. from Columbia University.

At Mississippi State College, where
Dr. Gaines was a professor of Eng-
lish, he met and married Miss Sadie
duVergne Robert, the daughter of
the dean. In 1927, following pro-
fessorships at Furman and the Uni-
versity of Virginia, he became pres-
ident of Wake Forest College. Three
years later, he assumed the presi-
dency of Washington and Lee at
the age of 38.

Presidency of W&L

During the 29 years that Dr.
Gaines spent as president of W&L,
the University’s assets grew from
$3,290,000 to over $16,000,000 and the
alumni fund from $3,750 to $100,000.
Financial achievements were but a
small part of Dr. Gaines’ additions
to the University. Tucker Hall, Mc-
Cormick Library, the Student Union
Building, and duPont Hall were all
added during his tenure. During his
retirement Dr. Gaines spearheaded
the campaign to raise $2,000,000 for
new science and journalism facilities
for the University.

A non-subsidized athletic program,
which has become highly successful,
was put into effect during Dr.
Gaines’ administration.

State and National Positions

Outside of the University, Dr.
Gaines held positions of great im-
portance in state and national edu-
cation. He was president of the
Southern University Conference in
1939-1940 and president of the Asso-
ciation of American Colleges in 1944-
45. As well, Dr. Gaines headed the
Virginia Foundation for Independent
Colleges from its foundation in
1953 until 1955. In 1957 he was
awarded jury chairman of the Free-
dom Foundation in Valley Forge,
Penn. From 1941 to 1959 he was
chairman of the Virginia State Com-
mittee for War Bonds for which he
was decorated by Great Britain with
the King’s Medal for Services.

Dr. Gaines was also a trustee of
the Carnegie Foundation for Inter-
national peace from 1931 to 1951, and
held the chairmanships of the Fed-
eral Emergency Relief Administra-
tion for Virginia and the Virginia
State Planning Board.

As a writer, Dr. Gaines enjoyed
considerable success with his two
major works, Lee — The Final
Achievement, an account of Gen-
eral Lee’s accomplishments as pres-
ident of Washington College, and
The Southern Plantation.

Dr. Gaines received honorary de-
grees from fifteen colleges and uni-
versities, including Duke, Baylor,
the University of North Carolina,
Washington and Lee, and the Uni-
versity of the South.

Surviving Dr. Gaines are his wife,
Mrs. Sadie duVergne Robert Gaines;
three sons: Dr. Francis P. Gaines, Jr.
and Dr. Edwin Metcalf Gaines, both
of Tuscon, Arizona, and William R.
Gaines, New York; and seven grand-
children.

Funeral Services were held in Lee
Chapel Friday, January 31, at eleven
o clock.

Dr. Gaines: He Rode With Lee

The following editorial, written shortly after Dr. Gaines death
is reprinted from the Ledger-Star (Norfolk).

 

His first public recitation, we are told, was ‘The Sword
of Lee,” delivered at Memorial Day services at Wytheville
cemetary when he was only seven. Dead now, three score and
four years later, his life demonstrates the significance in this.

For Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines, president of Washing-
ton and Lee University for 29 years until his retirement in
1959, made General Lee his personal hero, the Civil War a
subject of his research, and the school at Lexington and its im-
provement his career, and his success owes, in large part, to
the oratorical skills that he began developing that morning at

Wytheville.

Fairly short of stature, he was stocky and his jaw was
squared-off and heavy, like a reference book. His silver hair,
and thick hand that would swing through the air to emphasize a
point, added authority to what he had to say As a politician, he
would have been, perhaps, of the Bryan mold; as a preacher,
probably a Sockman or Fosdick; as an entertainer, the Will
Rogers type, intelligent and full of good humor. As an educa-
tor, Dr. Gaines himself set the pattern. A university president,
he was no ivory-tower scholar; he was not even mainly an
administrator. He became education’s emissary to the outside
world, pleading for its larger, voluntary support.

He spoke of the ‘“‘new seriousness” in American education
and abolished heavily-subsidized athletics at Washington and
Lee. He stressed the importance of a top faculty and recruited
more holders of the doctoral degree for Washington and Lee
than any other school of comparable size but one; he won
salary increases for his faculty and saw national polls rank
Washington and Lee among the top ten small men’s colleges
in the nation. One of his last services was to lead a fund drive
for an improved physical plant.

When he was inaugurated president in 1930, Washington
and Lee’s assets totaled $3 million and at his retirement they
came to $16 million. Alumni giving had increased from
$3000 annually to more than $100,000 and the school’s en-
dowment had increased ten fold.

But more important even than this spectacular record for
Washington and Lee, was the trend which Dr. Gaines helped
set for voluntary business support of private colleges. His in-
fluence here was tremendous, especially in Virginia through
the Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges, but else-
where through the country as well.

In his Lee—The Final Achievement Dr. Gaines tells of
the General’s last five years, how he rejected lucrative busi-
ness offers to take over a small college named for Washington,
a man whom he immensely admired, its candle nearly snuffed
out by the Civil War, how he understood that education would
be one of the South’s most pressing needs in the difficult years
ahead and how he set out to build a really fine school.

Although the contributions of both General Lee and Dr.
Gaines extend beyond the university, the educator would prob-
ably consider it his highest tribute if he were recognized as hav-
ing helped the General achieve this goal. If so, the tribute be-
longs to him.

He Saw In Washington & Lee An Ideal

By LARRY MEEKS

(Editor’s note: The following
article, compiled from AP news
releases and University files is a
review of Dr. Gaines’ career, a
career that has earned recognition
for him as one of Virginia’s great-
est educators and one of the lead-
ing educators of the South. This
page is dedicated to the memory
of Dr. Gaines and is especially
written for those students that
enrolled at W&L since his retire-
ment from the presidency and
had only a limited contact with
him.)

Dr. Francis P. Gaines served for
29 years as president of Washington
and Lee, and during that time his
attitude toward the purposes of a
university changed little from the
statement he made during his in-
augural assembly held in Lee Chapel
in October of 1930. At that time, he
said, “To think of Washington and
Lee is to believe in an ideal...To
think of this ideal is to believe that
still it has power...Its power is...
to deposit in the life of a boy some-
thing a little finer than culture, a
little rarer than competence, a little
nobler than success; to quicken a
dream in the young brain... to fur-
nish young personality with potency
and poise.”

most of his boyhood near Wythe-
ville. In 1909 he graduated from Fork

Born the son of a Baptist minister

 

 

Dr. Gaines in his Washington Hall office shortly before his retirement

 

received his A.M. degree from the
University of Chicago two years lat-
er, and in 1924, he received his Ph.D.
degree from Columbia University.

After one year as principal of the
Green Bay (Va.) High School, he ac-
cepted a position at Mississippi State.
There he met and married Miss Sadie
duVergne Robert, the daughter of
the dean. Before becoming president
of Wake Forest in 1927, Dr. Gaines
held professorships at Furman Uni-
versity and at the University of
Virginia.

In 1930, Dr. Gaines became presi-
dent of Washington and Lee. Shortly
after his inauguration he told a stu-
dent reporter, “I want to live just as
close to the students as I can, and
I'm going to get into every activity
in which they'll have me.” During
his years here he tried to main-
tain this close contact, but the
changing role of the college presi-
dent prevented him from being as
close to the students as he would
have liked to be.

President’s Duties

In an interview at the time of his
retirement he recalled, “When I came
here the administrative staff consist-
ed of only the president, the dean,
the treasurer, and the registrar. With
the dean, I was the admissions com-
mittee, the discipline committee, to

S speeches Stressed Character

(Editor’s note: During his career, Dr. Gaines earned a reputation
as an outstanding and eloquent orator. Below are printed several excerpts
from speeches over the years.)

Youth and the Modern World

If I had mastery of the pictorial art of contrast, a touch of the talent
of Velasques, I should attempt a painting to be called “The Horizon of
Tomorrow.” The entire background would be heavy, black skies; against
that background would be the face of an American youth; and the face
would be full of fight.

* EJ *

The phase of character is the primary duty of all agencies that endeavor
to prepare youth. It should be the sacrificial concern of the home, the
ultimate procedure of the school, the heavenly interpretation of the
church, I confess to little sympathy with any home life or school program
that seeks a detour around the disciplines, the hardships, even the severity
from which great character is perfected. The modern world invites youth to
a nobler purpose, born of the very difficulties of our age. That youth
must know the full assurance of those who have achieved a “contempt
for softness.”

* * ok

We must tell these young people again how great is the heritage we
have brought them, how easily they may toss it aside. It is the heritage
of the moral concept, first delivered on Sinai, then enlarged and made
beautiful on the immortal mount of the sermon by Christ; it is the heritage
of the Athenian culture, the deathless dream of beauty; it is the heritage
of the Romans who, after bloody blundering, came to a crystallization
in the legal codes of Justinian; it is the heritage of the Anglo-Saxon faith
and daring in behalf of personal liberty, from Magna Carta to the Declara-
tion of Independence. The summations of all that is best in human history
we offer this young generation, to preserve or, if they will, to despoil.

How great is that heritage! How imperative the responsibility of these
legacies! How incalculable the loss if they be neglected! How command-
ing is the obligation of the centuries!

“Follow Your Patron Saints”

There is another verse in St. Pau! that I commend to you, gentlemen.

 

Development and Heritage

I see it sometimes as though it were on a parchment and a strange and
holy light behind it. I know of no verse on earth that could be more
significant to you. St. Paul says “Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
good report,’—what about these?—“think of these things.” Pick your minds
up and put them on these things. You can do that; no one else can do it for
you, but you can get help.

Not long after I got here a man made a little speech. He said a very
simple thing, and it didn’t tremendously impress me at the time. And yet
across the years, I’ve realized that I haven’t heard a much more inspiring
suggestion. He said that somewhere in England, in the British Isles there
is a college with an entrance arch, and on that entrance arch, there were
four words engraved, or inscribed. And those four words were simply
these: “Follow your patron saints.” And then he said that if there is a
college in the world in which young men should heed that advice, it’s
Washington and Lee.

Follow your patron saints, and you will find the true and honest and the
just and the pure and the lovely. Follow them not merely because they
are notable figures in history. Remember that each one of them had his
moments like yours. Perhaps the greatness of Washington is at Valley
Forge, and the majesty of Lee is at Appomattox, but they went through
their Valley Forges and their Appomattoxes controlling always their own
thinking. They went through it and found, as I pray you will find, the
God who was their strength and their reward.

“The Stream of Consciousness”

It flows like a river, sometimes tranquilly when you lie on the campus
in the spring and watch the Lexington dogs, and sometimes when a prob-
lem has disturbed you it churns up furiously, but it flows. It’s subject to
strange emotional tributaries; like a river, particularly subject. You are
thinking of nothing in the world and you look upon an unhappy picture,
and your stream of consciousness is muddied and you wish you hadn't
seen that picture. I walked down a street not so long ago, this spring,
and from some shrub I could not see, I got the fragrance of lilacs, and 60
years were gone, and I was back in my mother’s little garden and she was
saying to me, “Son, the 21st of April is your birthday, and I hope the
lilacs are in bloom by that day.” I hope they bloom in eternity.

 

 

Here he is making his final speech, an address to the ODK assembly
on December 2 on “Credentials for Leadership.” (Borthwick)

Butch West
for the first time this season, re-
placing freshman Bruce Builder. The
veteran quartet of Tom Stover (147),
Pete Winfield (157), Ed Jansen (167)
and captain Herbie Smith (177) will
again represent W&L in the middle
weights. Freshman Warren Stewart
will wrestle heavyweight.

Football Schedule Set

It looks like another busy fall for
party-goers next year. The 1964
football schedule has the Generals
playing at home on four consecutive
weekends. Three of the four oppon-
ents—Hampden-Sydney, Susquehan-
na and Sewanee—beat W&L this
past season. The fourth—Bridge-
water will be here October 31, Par-
ents’ Weekend.

For the first time in several years,
Washington and Lee will play five
home games, meeting Washington
(Mo.) here in the season finale.

The Generals have a record of 40-
31-2 in previous games against next
year’s opponents. As for 1964, Coach
Lee McLaughlin says, “We’re faced
with the prospect of replacing 11
men on the first team. “7e’ll have our
work cut out for us.”

The complete schedule: Sept 26—

 

At Randolph-Macon, Oct. 3—At
Oberlin, Oct. 10—At Centre, Oct.
17—Susquehanna, Oct. 24—Hamp-

den-Sydney, Oct. 31—Bridgewater,

Miller said of the team’s 3-1 rec-
ord, “I think we’re wrestling up to
our capabilities. Some of the teams
we beat badly last year are greatly
improved.”

The wrestlers have beaten North
Carolina (16-14), Oneonta Teachers
(19-13), and Hartwick College (21-
8).

Musick is the only man still un-
beaten. The freshman has a 3-0-1
record, with two pins. Stover, at 3-1,
is the only other wrestler over the
.500 mark.

Speaking of the .500 mark, Wash-

be trying to get past that obstacle
for the first time this season. They
will meet Richmond Professional
Institute in Richmond.

The Generals, who defeated Penn-

carry a 3-3 slate into the contest.

Coach Bob McHenry says of RPI,
who is 3-7, that “despite its record,
RPI is a good club. It has a pair
of top notch performers in C. G.

Winston and Shaheen led the Rams

(Games through Wednesday)

As tournament time approaches in
basketball this week, Bob Stauffer
and Andy Kilpatrick scored 30 points
between them, led a strong PiKA
squad to a 53-33 victory over an
aggressive but cold-shooting Phi Psi
outfit. Beta looked like a winner in
their league, Bob Lohman pacing
them to victory over NFU,45-22.
Lohman scored 22 points to tie for
the week’s scoring honors. Beta must
beat only SPE (1-1) next week to
gain a spot in the finals.

SAE met their strongest challenge
yet Wednesday night against Delt.
For a change, a referee (namely
Robin Kell) called fouls, and four
foul shots by Henry Sackett late in
the first half enabled SAE to take a
two-point lead at the break. Sackett

_| closed with 19 points, as SAE pulled
-| away in the second half to win, 46-
i | 33.

In other games, Lambda Chi took
the lead from Phi Delt with five
minutes to play, hung on to win a
thriller, 40-35. Phi Delt had earlier
forfeited to SPE. Kappa Sig defeated
Phi Kap 49-33 despite Kiah Ford’s

-|22-point contribution to a losing

cause. With Mike Bowerman scor-
ing 18, Delt preceded their loss to
SAE with a 53-25 victory over Sig-
ma Chi. DU gained a forfeit win over
KA.

The best: 1. SAE, 3-0, 2. Sigma
Nu, 3-0; 3. PiKA, 3-0.

Phi Gam extended their unbeaten
string to three in wrestling by beat-
ing Pi Phi, 23-13. Phi Gam was far
enough ahead after six matches to
forfeit the last two weight classes,
otherwise lost only one decision. For
Pi Phi, it was their second loss of
the week—they had earlier been
beaten by SAE, 20-15.

KA needed five pins to stave off
SPE, 25-15, and extend their record
to 4-0. Undefeated in their league,
KA has clinched a playoff spot. Beta
also earned the finals when they

defeated PiKA, 23-10. The match
gave Beta a 2-0-1 record against

The best: 1. Phi Gam, 3-0; 2. KA,
4-0; 3. Delt, 2-1.

The top three in bowling all ex-
tended unbeaten records this week.
Kappa Sig did it without picking

Ridolphi and Dick Musick to fight
off a surprising NFU squad, 2335 pins
to 2227.

Craig Blackstock bowled high
game of the week, a 245, for Sigma
Chi, but to no avail as defending
champion Phi Kap swept to a 4-0
victory. All three victors have un-
beaten opponents yet to face—ZBT
(1-0) for Phi Kap, Beta (2-0) for
Kappa Sig, and Phi Delt (1-0) for
SAE. The fourth championship will
probably be decided next week when
Pi Phi (3-0) faces Phi Psi (2-0)

The best: 1. Pi Kap, 3-0; 2. SAE,
3-0; 3. Kappa Sig, 3-0.

A busy week of handball saw KA
and Delt continue their winning
ways. KA crushed Phi Kap, forfeit
victor over Law earlier in the week,
by a score of 5-0. Johnny McDaniels
led Delt to a 4-1 win over Pi Phi,
loser also to Kappa Sig by the same
ssore. Sigma Nu took two, 4-1 over
ZBT, and 3-2 over Phi Gam. PEP
did likewise, beating DU 3-2 and
NFU by a forfeit to close out a
winning 3-1 season.

The best: 1. Beta, 2-0; 2. Delt,
3-0; 3. KA, 3-0.

By GUY UNANGST
Friday Sports Editor

Beta or Delt will win the intra-
mural handball championship this
year.

Beta is defending school champion.
Neither they nor Delt has as yet
been beaten, and neither will be,
except by the other.

In 1958, a team of faculty members
won the handball championship. As
of 1959, they no longer entered a
team. The reason—the fraternities’
loss of the championship trophy.

Article IV, section E of the Consti-
tution and By-Laws of the Depart-
ment of Intramural Athletics, as
published in the present (1960) edi-
tion of The Guide to Intramural
Athletics at Washington and Lee,
states: “The Faculty Club may enter
a team in any intramural sport pro-
vided the two-thirds of the frater-
nity representatives do not object
at the orientation meeting of the
sport.”

The faculty did not make the
handball schedule in 1959, because
the fraternities chose to invoke the
“two-thirds” rule.

Frank A. Parsons, at that time the
Faculty Handball Manager, para-
phrased the rule—“The faculty can
participate, as long as it doesn’t win.”
He said that to his knowledge Phi
Psi was the only fraternity to vote
in favor of allowing the faculty to
play. Phi Psi finished second to the
faculty in 1958,

In a letter to the Ring-tum Phi
at the time of the blackball, Par-
sons said, “The faculty bowling team
was also challenged, but when it was
learned that this team was no threat
to the championship, its participation

was condoned, even welcomed.”

The Washington Post and Times-
Herald ran a story on the ruling,
headlining it, “If You Can’t Beat
‘Em, Ban Them.” The Ring-tum Phi
ran an editorial, saying, “The stu-
dents have certainly demonstrated
that they are poor losers,”

The faculty handball team swept
through the regular 1958 season and
the playoffs without a loss. They lost
but one individual match, and that
in the finals with a professor who
had never before played handball.
They lost perhaps half a dozen in-
dividual games.

Coach Dick Miller said, “I don’t
think any one fraternity has the
men to beat the faculty.” He cited
Norm Lord and Joe Lyles as the best
in the athletic department.

Parsons said the faculty is “eager
to play any time the fraternities
are willing.” He said the faculty
would even be willing to play an
all-star team—for the handball
trophy. The best outside the gym—
President Fred C. Cole, accounting
professor Jay Cook, geology profes-
sor Ed Spencer, Dean Ed Atwood,
proctor Bob Murray, and Parsons.

Perhaps the fraternities are ready
now to place the handball trophy
on the line. Delt athletic manager
Gordon Gay says, “If the Delt
team wins the intramural champion-
ship, we would be happy to meet
the best of the faculty.”

The Generals, victims of a chal-

lenging schedule, hold a 2-2 record.
One of these victories cames over
powerful Loyola of Baltimore in
what coach Eastman terms a “pleas-
ant surprise.”
Bruce Houghton, the team’s div-
ing specialist, leads the squad in
total points followed closely by Brad
Taylor, a freshman sprinter. Diving
and breast stroke must be consid-
ered the Generals’ best events. Co-
captain Jim Wallenstein and Skip

Dr. Gaines: He Saw An Ideal

(Continued from page 2)

mittee, and what today we call the
development committee.” In these
varied capacities he was indeed con-
nected with every phase of the col-
lege’s activity, but through the
years, the widening responsibilities
of a college president began to take
him away from the everyday busi-
ness of ee and Lee.

In his words, “I think the presi-
dent’s duties eed when the
college recognized its need for varied
and generous cooperation from those
other than its immediate family. It
became necessary to take the cole
lege to the supporting publics, not
wait for them to come to it.”

Accomplishment

During his administration he
helped build an excellent faculty,
and among schools of comparable
size and general academic charac-
ter, only one college can list more
professors with Ph.D. degrees, a
study taken near the time of his re-
tirement showed.

Three years before he retired, a

| nationwide survey of educators, con- |

ducted by the Chicago Tribune,
ranked Washington and Lee as one
of the ten best men’s colleges in the
United States.

Also under Dr. Gaines’ direction,
the physical plant of the university
was enlarged quite considerably. The
additions include Tucker Hall, Mc-
Cormick Library, an enlarged facil-
ity using the shell of the old Car-
negie Library for its stack area, a
new student union building, and du-
Pont Hall. The month of his resig-

nation the new dining hall, Baker
and Davis dormitories and the sup-
ply store were put into service.

There were also times of crisis and
difficulty during his years here.
There were the days of World War
II in which he faced the prospect
of a college with empty classrooms,
but he saw a way out and wrote,
“To the government, we do not say
‘Save the colleges.’ Rather we say
‘Use the colleges’.”

The government did use the col-
leges and from 1942 to 1946, Wash-
ington and Lee was home to the
Army School for Special Services,
and more than 25,000 army per-
sonnel attended the _ specialized
courses offered here.

Athletics

Dr.
the battle in the cause of non-sub-
sidized athletics. When the college
elected to abandon a big-time foot-
ball program in 1954, there were
threats of non-support from im-
portant alumni groups and predic-
tions of ruin for Washington and
Lee. Under President Gaines’ lead-
ership, however, the college cham-
pioned a cause aimed at placing
sports in proper perspective for a
small, liberal arts college.

single disappointment, except in my
own performance. I have only hap-
py and grateful feelings for all those
who have supported me—the trus-
tees, the faculty, my staff, the stu-
dents, and many other good friends
of this university.”

Shortly after his retirement, Dr.
Gaines was made chancellor of the
University and he retained this post
until his death December 31. Fun-
eral services were held for him in
Lee Chapel where he was inaugu-
rated as W&L president and where
