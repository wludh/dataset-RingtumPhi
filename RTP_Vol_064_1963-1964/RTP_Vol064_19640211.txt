thor, Christopher Marlowe. This second Troub effort of the
1963-64 season will be staged March 5-8.

 

 

Two Professors, Chaplain
Accompany Four Students

Seven Negroes from Hampton Institute visited the Wash-
ington and Lee campus this weekend to participate in an inter-
racial cultural exchange sponsored by the R. E. Lee Episcopal
Church.

The group from Hampton, a four-year Liberal Arts

college, included Rev. Walter D. Dennis, chaplain of the
*Institute; Virginius Thornton, Pro-
fessor of History; and students Ron-
ald Griffin, Clarence Hollis, Clinton
Parks, Ed Rodman, and Michael
Scott.

sor of Chemistry, who portrays Glut-
tony, and Tom Holden, Pride, Bill
Carson, Covetousness, Sid Parham,
Wrath, Ward Briggs, Envy, Jay
Hight, Sloth, and a still-uncast wo-

man who will play the part of
Letchery.
Other important characters are

Bob Fussell who plays the Chorus
and Starke Sydnor who plays the
Old Man. While the cast is large,
certain actors will play two roles
in the evening. Gay Reading and
John Moore double and appear first
as the sorcerers Valdes and Corne-
lius, and later as Lucifer and Beelze-
bub.

Charles Bright and Joe Couch
play two scholarly friends of Faus-
tus’, while Jeff Williams will play
Wagner, Faustus’ servant. Pete Stell-
ing will portray Emporer Charles V
whom Faustus delights with magical
tricks.

Low Comedy

An important part of the play will
be more lighthearted in nature than
the tragical pursuits of Faustus. This
part includes the roles of low com-
ics who used to please the less edu-
cated Blizabethan audiences with
their ribald jests and rowdy pester-
ing.

Featured in these low comic roles
will be Lockhart Handley who will
play both roles of the Clown and
Robin; Joe Volpe who will play an
Elizabethan Pope; and Lew Davis
who will play Rafe, a mischievous
cohort of Robin’s.

Also in the cast are Jody Luck,
Steve Millard, Guy Glenn, and Bill
O’Neal who will round out the cast
of 23 as the Good and Evil Angels
and sundry vicious devils.

Directing the play is Dr. Cecil
Jones.

| quarterly, was entitled “Disposition
| of Physical Exhibits Used in Crimi-
| nal Cases,” and it was written from
| an idea suggested to Partington by
| Professor Wilfred J. Ritz of the Law
| School.

| The situation which Partington re-
| searched and wrote about is the
number of convicted criminals who
appeal for retrial from their prison
cells. The points on which these
| men make their appeals are varied—
and in some instances their cases do
come up for retrial—but it may be
years after their conviction. As
Partington points out in his article,
“the question arises as to whether
it is ever safe to destroy or other-
wise dispose of evidence, at least,
until a prisoner has died or been
released from incarceration.”

Keep the Exhibits?

Partington cites cases which have
come up for retrial more than twenty
years after the original conviction
in which the criminals have been
set free because of a lack of evidence
in the new trial. Partington predicts
that there will be more and more
new trials in the future, and that the
problem of preserving the exhibits
used as evidence in the original
trials is becoming more and more of
a necessity, however much a prob-
lem it is.

In researching the problem, Part-
ington sent one hundred and thirty-
five letters to clerks of courts, prose-
cuting attorneys, and others in all
fifty states of the union. Seventy-
six replies were received from forty-
six states, the Alttorney Generals of
the United States and military of-
ficers. There is no uniform statute as
to how long physical evidence must
be kept—and some states have no
statutes at all to this effect.

the main one to be dealt with in

A [pproach To Desegregation
Topic of Mixed Discussion

By ROGER PAINE
Editor-in-Chief
Desegregation at Washington and Lee was the topic of a
discussion Saturday night at the home Rev. John Fletcher,
Rector of the Robert E. Lee Episcopal Church. A delegation
of students from all-Negro Hampton Institute, Hampton, Va.,

a Negro clergyman, a Negro profes-*
sor, and several W&L students and
faculty members took part in the
discussion.

Jenks and Piney Keynote

Dr. William A. Jenks, Professor of
History, and Dr. Edward L. Pinney,
Associate Professor of Political Sci-
ence, keynoted the discussion. Dr.
Jenks, who was assigned the task of
explaining the position of the W&L
faculty on integration of the school,
explained that it was impossible to
arrive at any solid conclusions as to
W&L’'s position. As far as he knew,
no definite statement had been made
by the Board of Trustees either for
or against integration of the student
body.

Dr. Jenks expressed his own per-
sonal surprise that three schools
which he thought Washington and
Lee would lead in the problem of
integration—Mercer, Stetson, and
Wake Forest—had already made the
advance, leaving W&L as one of the
few leading southern colleges re-
maining segregated. He concluded |

 

possible that it is already too late for |

W&L to do more than respond to}

the inexorable social movement

in the United States with a kind of |

tokenism?
No Negro Applications

Dr. Pinney followed these remarks |

 

line of discussion, saying he felt it
should not be the Negro’s responsi-
bility to take the first step in the
W&L problem. Washington and Lee
should make the first move, he said—
the Negro high school student can
not be expected to apply to a college
which he feels sure would turn
him down because of his color.
Moreover, it was assumed that no
W&L catalogues are sent to Negro
high schools, nor are any of W&L’s
other methods of “sales procedure”
directed toward any Negro secondary
schools. It was pointed out that as
a result, few high school graduates
of the Negro race have a chance to
know anything about W&L.

W&L Silence

A further development from this,
mentioned by a W&L student, was
the statement that W&L’s silence on
the integration issue speaks louder
than any words—until W&L makes
an actual statement of policy, saying
that it will not discriminate against
applicants on the basis of race, no
qualified Negroes can be expected to
apply.

One Negro student expressed im-
patience with the general view of
white people regarding integration:
he said they generally feel that inte-
gration is a “one-way street,” and
that it is only the Negro who is

The Chief of Police of Daytona
Beach, Florida, in an effort to lower
the number of arrests made annually
during Spring Vacation, has released
a list of rules to all prospective
collegians contemplating taking their
coming rest period where the girls
are:

1. Do not drink intoxicating bev-
erages on the streets or sidewalks

2. Do not have intoxicating bev-
erages in your possession if you are
under 21 years of age or attempt to
obtain any by use of false identifi-
cation.

3. Do not start fires on the beach
or any other public property.

4. Do not mark your car with any
writings, designs, figures or pictures
that could be considered obscene
or indecent or dress in a manner that
could be so considered.

5. Do net trespass on private prop-
erty such as motels or hotels with-

 

Brown of R. E. Lee when they met
at a conference in New York spon-
sored by the MHpiscopal Church.
“One of the basic problems in race
relations today is the lack of com-
munication between whites and Ne-
groes,” Rev. Brown commented, “and
we hoped this weekend would help
to alleviate this.”

In order to give the visitors a
well-rounded view of W&L, Brown
asked the administration if they
might attend classes. Permission was
granted, and the individual profes-
sors concerned were asked, in ac-
cordance with the administration’s
wishes, if they had any objections.
Plans were made for the visitors to
stay at the homes of members of
R. E. Lee Episcopal Church.

The weekend started with a dinner
and an informal discussion at the
home of Rev. Brown on Friday
night. In addition to the group from
Hampton, W&L students Rick Bel-
ser, Joel Bennett, Rod Cockshutt,
and Jim Ledbetter attended. The
conversation centered around the
various Negro movements today and
the ways in which they are attempt-
ing to achieve racial equality.

Attended Classes

The W&L students escorted the
visitors to their classes on Saturday
morning. The Roanoke Times com-
mented that it was the first time
since the late Eighteenth Century
that Negroes had attended classes at
Washington and Lee.

The groups met for lunch at the
Robert E. Lee Hotel, and the visitors
were given a tour of the campus on
Saturday afternoon. After supper at
Rev. John Fletcher’s, discussion was
led by Dr. Jenks and Professor Pin-
ney of the Washington and Lee fac-
ulty, which was attended by a large
group of interested students and fac-
ulty members.

Plans are being made to recipro-
cate the visit early in March. Every-
one concerned reported that the
weekend was an unqualified success.
Rev. Brown said that “The discus-
sions and the experiences we had to-
gether were beyond our expecta-
tions.” One of the W&L students
commented that “Many insights were
gained on both sides, many doubts
and fears were dispelled, and many
friends were made.”

We Shall Overcome

You may agree or disagree with the aims and impli-
cations of the current upheaval in civil rights, but we
will guarantee you one thing: you cannot remain silent,
nor can you remain neutral about this issue. The Negro
has asked the nation for his basic rights as an American.
No one can avoid being influenced by his plea. Now is
the time to be counted, and every individual, every
group, and every institution must make a decision for or
against the rights of the Negro. Prolonged silence speaks
louder than any words.

 

It is time for Washington and Lee to take a
stand on the civil rights issue. We feel that two
basic considerations should determine the Univer-
sity’s decision: its duty to its student body, and its
duty to the area which it serves.

The first consideration—W&L’s responsibility to its
students—is a pragmatic one: an education should in-
crease a student’s ability to participate in the present-day
world, Washington and Lee graduates will find themselves
working with Negroes in whatever vocation they may
choose. In business, law, medicine, education, and the arts,
Negroes are finding places as highly skilled and competent
contributors in their own right. Well-trained Negroes are
beginning to compete successfully with white men when
applying for important posts.

It is thus important for white men and women to learn
to work with Negroes without being conscious of the dif-
ference in race. A white lawyer will have to be able to
work with a Negro lawyer on a professional level, and to
do that he will have to be able to look upon his colleague
as a person life himself, educated in his own field, and
not merely as a Negro. Here at Washington and Lee we
as students are being hurt when we allow the University
to postpone this important phase of our education.
Whether we like it or not, the Negro has asserted himself
as capable of contributing in many crucial areas in the
life of our society—the time has come for men of both
races to join forces.

Our Deans take pride in the fact that W&L’s
geographical distribution is diverse. But this is im-
pressive only on the surface: the broad, benevol-
ent hand of our admissions Committee seemingly
must skip over any high school students (how-
ever qualified) whose skin is dark. If Washington
and Lee is ever to be great, it must cease being so
superficial,

W&L will have to make this step soon if it doesn’t
want to be swept through the door at the last moment.
Many schools of our type and in our general area have al-
ready made their decision: Mercer, Stetson, Wake Forest,
Randolph-Macon, Duke, and Sewanee, to name but a
few. With each passing month W&L’s silence is looking
more antiquated, more bigoted, and more embarrassing.
While we have long since lost our chance to be the South’s
first champion of the rights of all men, let us at least
prevent ourselves from looking like the South’s last
sewer of prejudice.

Integration is not a one-way street—we have
as much to gain by drawing Negro students as we
hope they could gain by taking their education
here. W&XL can no longer afford to throw up the
“freedom of association” argument—its super-
ficiality has been pegged and cast aside by greater
institutions than we are. The Negro in this coun-
try has earned his own place in the history, in the
literature, in the past, and in the future of the
United States. We hope that 1964 marks Jim
Crow’s funeral. We hope that in 1964 the Wash-
ington and Lee Board of Trustees will assure the
qualified Negro that he does have a place here. We
hope the Trustees will do this for their own sake,
for the sake of the Negro and for the sake of the
whole University community.

‘Charade’ Highly Praised

For Actors’ Performances

By TOM PACE

“Charade”—a fast moving suspense-comedy starring Audrey Hep-
burn and Cary Grant, with Walter Matthau and James Coburn
featured as co-stars. It is directed by Stanley Donen. The music is
written by Henry Mancini.

The story—Audrey Hepburn is on vacation in Switzerland from
Paris and her husband. She meets Cary Grant, with whom she re-
fuses to become acquainted, as she already knows too many people.
She returns to Paris. Her husband has been murdered. She now
has time for Cary Grant. And for the C.1A., the Paris police, and
three old friends of her husband whom she has never seen before.

Her husband was killed because he had a great deal of money.
His old friends now believe Audrey to have it. And thus the meat
of the story—who has the money and who wants it most—is cluttered
up by a series of delightful murders and bewildering charades. The
climax and the finale are both quite suspenseful, and it is amusing to
try and figure out who is playing what charade.

" The story alone should provide enough interest to entertain most

Keith Wheeler: Peaceable Lane (Sig-
net, $.75).

Peaceable Lane is a dead-end
suburb street near New York’s
Westchester County. Eleven homes
are located on the lane, all priced
around $30,000, all aimed at attract-
ing the middle-income families
whose breadwinners work in New
York City and who want to buy and
settle down. Peaceable Lane’s eleven
families range from doctors and law-
yers to union vice president and a
radio commentator. Three of these
families are Jewish.

At the center of the story is west-
erner Matt Jones, a success in the
New York advertising business,
happy with his wife and his elemen-
tary school aged son. The families
who live on Peaceable Lane do not
have much in common with one
another, so the only thing that binds
any of them together as a neighbor-
hood is their mutual problem with
crab grass. Suddenly their relaxed
world of charcoal-broiled steaks and
car-pools for the kids explodes: one
of the owners on the lane plans to
sell his house to a Negro.

 

Current Literature in Review

 

 

‘Peaceable Lane’ Explores
Limits Of White Prejudice

Reviewed by Roger Paine

Forceful and Exciting

From this point onward, Peaceful
Lane becomes a forceful and excit-
ing novel. Practically every episode
is packed with tension; violence
breaks out often; the people of
Peaceful Lane demonstrate every
facet of prejudice, from being loud-
mouthed bigots to being constrained
non-bigots. The novel itself was a
December choice in 1960 of the
Book-of-the-Month Club, and its au-
thor, Keith Wheeler, is an associate
editor of Life Magazine.

Wheeler's intent is patently didac-
tic—as Time said: Peaceful Lane “is
on somewhat distant terms with lit-
erature, and breathlessly intimate
with today’s headlines.” It is decid-
edly a “topical” novel, and its char-
acters are types. None of the people
in the story actually develop as the
story unfolds—their reactions are
predictable from the start. But de-
spite the stereotypes, the characters
are expertly drawn, offer good range
to the plot, and they are well-
handled through all the explosive
scenes that are a part of the novel.

Negro as Neighbor

Without giving away any import-

ant revelations of the plot, here is
the problem which confronted the
homeowners on Peaceful Lane: one
of their neighbors—a man with
whom none of them had ever gotten
along — is selling his house to
the highest bidder. This bidder hap-
pens to be a rich Negro who wants
to get out of his New York City
apartment with his wife and child.
The people on the lane are disturbed
by the possibility that their homes
may drop as much as $10,000 in their
value if a Negro moves in, They
meet to decide what should be done.

For Matt Jones, the decision be-
comes a particularly painful one, for
he learns the Negro buyer is an
artist named Lamar Winter, whom
he has known and worked with for
seven years in his advertising busi-
ness. Winter himself iis a stereotype:
handsome, arrogant, devoted to his
wife (who is beautiful), father of a
child who is obviously intelligent
and talented. Matt’s problem is how
to cope with the opposing lines of
tension—his friendship to Winter,
and the furor on Peaceful Lane (plus
the very real possibility of a loss

Campus Personalities

 

By GARETH ADEN

The ‘Nighthawk’ of the Campus

There is no harder man to find
on the Hill—at night—and yet they
say he is always there. The late
studier will catch a glimpse of him
now and then, walking behind the
colonnade or checking the rooms
in Robinson. He never stays long,
disappearing as quietly as he comes.

Those students who do not know
Palmer Eugene Armstrong, W&L’s
trusty night-watchman, have
missed something. To many he is
known affectionately and appro-
priately as “Omni.” That is short
for “omnipresent,” and at times it
seems this name is not far from
right. In his own words: “I get
around,”

Palmer is a rather short, stocky
fellow with two front teeth missing
and a well-chewed Roi-Tan cigar
thrust into the gap. He is seldom
seen without his green hunting
jacket and his old hunting cap.

To my knowledge, he has only
two essential implements of trade
which are always in his possession,
his flashlight and his “punching
clock.” The latter instrument reg-
isters where and when he has been
during the night, and is a constant
source of curiosity for those who
have ever seen it.

Born in Collierstown, “out Route
No. Two by the reservior,” Palmer
lived there until he joined the
armed services. Since his father
died when Palmer was just eight,
he went to school only through
the sixth grade. He joined the
army at eighteen and served four
years in England. I asked him one
night if he had been a hero in
World War II. He answered simply

“no” and then added with a smile,
“I got out of that; I had a good
doctor.”

As Palmer tells it, he returned to
Rockbridge County after the service,
married, and began work in the
print shop of a Lexington firm.
After several years the firm closed
and on June 8, 1954 (he remembers
the date perfectly) Palmer began his
work for the University. He now
lives with his wife in their home
on Randolph St.

Evaluation of New Hampshire Pollings
Reveals Goldwater Still the Frontrunner

By WYATT B. DURRETTE, JR.

In the realm of politics, as in most
things, prediction is a dangerous
business—even for professionals. For
. an amateur its
_ treacherous: intel-
» lectual suicide you
might say.

With this in
mind I shall still
attempt to exam-
ine activities in
New Hampshire
where  Republi-
can hopefuls and
unhopefuls are
tramping about in
sub-zero weather
in an effort to capture the nation’s
first primary.

In an AP poll released last week
Arizona’s Senator Barry Goldwater
remained unchanged since Decem-
ber as the clear choice of those 26
New Hampshire county committee
members who replied. Thirty-three
were polled.

To the question—“‘whom do you

 

Durrette

consider the strongest GOP candi-
date against President Johnson
now?”—the replies were as follows:
Goldwater — 14; Rockefeller — 3;
Goldwater-Rockefeller even — 2;
Lodge—2; Nixon—1; undecided—4.

Who Will Be Nominated?

A second question—‘who will be
nominated in July?” — produced
these results: Goldwater—7; Nixon—
3; Lodge—2; Rockefeller—1; Scran-
ton—1; undecided—12. These find-
ings support those of Bruce Mac-
Donald, State Chairman of New
Hampshire for the Mock Convention,
who reports that Goldwater main-
tains his position as frontrunner.

But for every poll which says yes,
you can, if you search, find one
which says no—politics is no excep-
tion. So when workers for Gold-
water and Rockefeller plumbed the
N. H. depths last month only to find
that Lodge was the fair haired one,
no one was surprised except guess
who? Yep. Barry and Rocky and no
wonder—he’s working for the Dem-
ocrats.

Divided Allegience

Prominent N. H. Political figures
have divided their alligence. For-
mer Governor Robert Blood and
former U.S. Sen. Robert Upton are
counted in Rockefeller’s corner:
while former Governor Lane Dwinell
and U.S. Sen. Norris Cotton sup-
port Goldwater.

In declaring for Goldwater Dwinell
remarked, “I can support Barry
Goldwater because my experience
as Assistant Sec. of State (under
Eisenhower) convinces me of the
soundness of his approach to our na-
tion’s foreign affairs.” Dwinell was
an Eisenhower delegate to the con-
vention of 1952 and 1956.

Rough Edges

Senator Goldwater’s campaign was
initially disappointing to some of his
supporters, but as the rough edges
became tempered by experience
some of the misgivings departed. One
thing was clear: despite many re-
ports to the contrary the Senator had
not been building his campaign ma-

Racial Parley
Examines
Rights Issue

(Editor’s Note: This weekend
three Washington and Lee students
and a_ professor attended “The
Second American Revolution”
Conference at Bryn Mawr and
Haverford colleges in Pennsyl-
vania. The conference was a three-
day examinations of the current
civil rights movement, and the fol-
lowing is the first in a series of
articles about the conference and
the light it shed on the civil rights
movement.)

By TRACY HARRINGTON
Managing Editor

Over 500 students from colleges
throughout the country gathered at
Bryn Mawr and Haverford colleges
this past weekend
to study the efforts
now being made to
improve the Ne-
gro’s position in
society and to
consider the ef-
fects of these ef-
forts on the whole
of American so-
ciety.

Sponsored joint-
ly by Byrn Mawr
and Haverford, the
conference boasted an impressive
line-up of speakers. The leaders of
nearly all the major civil rights
groups were there, speaking before
the delegation of Negroes, whites,
and orientals.

Dr. John Hope Franklin, chairman
of the history department at Brook-
lyn College, keynoted the conference
Friday afternoon when he spoke on
“The Civil Rights Revolution: His-
torical Setting.” Dr. Franklin, often
considered the leading Negro edu-
cator in the United States, empha-
sized what he called the “intellec-
tual ingredients” which are neces-
sary for any social change and which
he felt prevailed in the current revo-
lution for Negro rights.

Two panel discussions followed
Franklin’s speech, the first of which
was of particular interest to those of
us who were from the South. The
National Director of CORE (Con-
gues on Racial Equality) James Far-
mer debated with Kilpatrick, editor
of the Richmond News-Leader and
author of The Case for Segregation
in the South. Kilpatrick attempted to
defend the Southern position, while
Farmer concentrated his efforts
largely on refuting Kilpatrick’s
claims of racial inferiority and the
property rights argument against
legislative action.

Sympathies of the delegation were
obviously not with Kilpatrick, who
lost his temper a number of times
and faired rather badly in argument
with the more articulate Farmer.

The most thought-provoking por-
tion of the conference, to me, occured
during the second panel discussion
when William Worthy, a spokesman
for the Freedom, Now Party and
correspondent for Afro-American
debated Rev. C. Tindale Vivian,
leader of the Southern Conference
Educational Fund (SCEF), which led
the activities in Birmingham and has
been intimately involved in rights
agitation in the South.

Worthy is an embittered, disillu-
sioned Negro intellectual who sees
no hope for the American Negro
until a complete national economic
and political revamp occurs. He is
essentially a marxist, has visited
Cuba and Red China in spite of gov-
ernment travel bans, and proposes
that Negroes accept the assistance of
Moa Tse Tung in their battle for
freedom. Worthy has lost all faith in
what he called the “bourgeois” ori-
entation of current civil rights
groups; indeed, he has lost all faith
in America itself.

Vivian, on the other hand, is
very much an optimist. He has seen
results (so he claims), and denies
emphatically Worthy’s charge that
civil rights groups don’t appeal to
the rank and file of American Ne-
gros. What Vivian asserts is that the
issues must be pushed, that the civil
rights battle can be won only if
the Negros base their fight on civil
justice for all and do not emphasize
their “Negro-ness.” He is avidly
anti-Black nationalism.

The two men found no common
ground of agreement, for they are on
opposing ends of the civil rights
movement,

Saturday morning was taken up by
a third panel discussion. James
Forman, Executive Secretary of the
Student Nonviolent Coordination
Committee (called SNCC, pronounc-
ed “snick”) joined with NAACP
Labor Secretary Herbert Hill and
William Higgs, Congressional Ad-
visor on Civil Rights Legislation. A
representative of the justice depart-
ment also participated.

Generals To Build N ew Athletic Facilities

New Gymnasium Planned;
Where, When Not Known

By JIM CROTHERS

Tuesday Sports Editor
President cole affirmed today in an exclusive interview with
the Tuesday Sports Editor that there are plans for new athletic
facilities at Washington and Lee. However, Dr. Cole also re-
vealed that no definite plans have been reached as to where
the new gym would be located, when construction would be

 

K

initiated, or even what the new plant*
would consist of.

“The only thing definitely decided
at this point,’ the President con-
tinued, “is that the Board of Trustees
has consented to allow certain speci-
fications to be submitted to an archi-
tect.” Dr. Cole, well-known as a
sports enthusiast himself, said that
several things are needed on campus
and a new gymnasium is definitely
one of these.

It has been know nthat the W&L
Physical Education department has,
for several weeks, been compiling
facts and figures about what they
would like to have incorporated in a
new gymnasium. President Cole as-
serted that plans for new facilities
were not secret, but that little has
been said simply because little is
known at the present, except that
Washington and Lee will, in the not-
too- distant f future, have a new gym.

Coach McHenry
Resigns Post

Will Coach LVC

Varsity basketball and_ lacrosse
coach, Bob McHenry, announced to-
day his tentative resignation from
the Washington and Lee athletic de-
partment in order to accept a similar
position at the Lebanon Valley Col-
lege in Pennsylvania.

McHenry, whose brother is athletic
director and football coach at Leb-
anon Valley, stated that it would be
“hard to leave” W&lL, but that his
resignation, which will become ef-
fective in June, was to “see if I could
really coach.”

Washington and Lee athletic direc-
tor, E. P. “Cy” Twombly said that
the Generals are in the process of
looking for a replacement, but that
so far, no decision has been reached
as to McHenry’s successor.

A graduate of W&L in 1956, Mc-
Henry returned to Lexington in
1958 after serving as _ assistant
basketball coach at Swarthmore Col-
lege and freshman coach at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. While play-
ing for the Generals, McHenry let-
tered in both lacrosse and basketball,
co-captained the 1954-55 cage team
and was named Most Valuable Play-
er by his teammates in 1955-56.

 

Mynttinen Sets Rifle Mark

John Mynttinen, sophomore rifle
ace, broke the Washington and Lee
school record for the prone position
with a score of 100-8x as the Gen-
eral shooters tied William and Mary
College 1356-1356 in a rifle match
held December 14 on the W&L firing
range.

Hoopsters Lose

To RMC, 103-57

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

One record was broken and one
tied as the Randolph-Macon Yellow
Jackets cruised to a 103-57 victory
over Washington and Lee Saturday
on the losers’ court. For the Gener-
als it was the worst performance of
the year.

Frank Kaminski, the Macon center,
scored 27 points to set a new stand-
ard at Randolph-Macon for points
scored in a four-year career. He
has totaled 1,743 points since he be-
gan his playing days at the Ashland,
Va., school. Also, the victor’s 103
points tied the record for number
of points in Doremus Gymnasium.

The Yellow Jackets moved ahead
6-4 early in the game and were
never headed after that. In the sec-
ond half they substituted freely

after taking a 59-22 advantage to

the locker room at halftime.
Kaminski was high scorer for

either team and would have had

more had he remained in the game.
At half time his total was 22. Irv
Sentz had 20 and Stan Trimble added
19. Lou Paterno paced the Generals
with 19.

The shooting percentages give one
reason for the lopsided score. Macon
hit on almost 50 per cent of its shots,
while the Generals were successful
on only 22.5 percent.

Tonight the Generals entertain
Roanoke College here at 8:00. Roa-
noke, led by sharpshooting guard
Monty Creggar, will be heavily fav-
ored to add another victory to its
11-4 record.

 

Frosh Cagers Down AMA;
Morrison Scores 25 As
Powell And Ogilvy Shine

In a wild, fast-breaking game yes-
terday, Washington and Lee’s fresh-
men basketballers downed Augusta
Military Academy, 87-79. The high
scoring contest saw both teams ripple
the cords in W&L’s Doremus Gym-
nasium, as the Generals grabbed
their sixth win in eight contests.

Tom Ramie of AMA led all scorers
with 37 points; Frank Morirson
scored 25 tallies to lead the home
victors as Roy Powell and Dave
Ogilvy, both with 20 points, followed
him closely in the individual scor-
ing. The Generals’ Mike Saunders
tallied 11 points, but was also out-
standing as a playmaker and team
leader.

‘W&L Bows To NC State

Then Beats Duke, 21-13

Too many exams and too much Fancy Dress took its toll
on the General wrestlers this weekend as the grapplers split
matches with North Carolina State and Duke, losing to the
Wolfpack before downing the Blue Devils on Saturday.

In the first match of the weekend trip, pins by Dick
Musick and Pete Winfield, and a 5-0 decision by Butch West

JV Wrestlers
Suffer Setbacks

By DICK DeWAUGH
Tuesday Sports Writer

While the varsity wrestlers were
gaining a split in their matches with
North Carolina State and Duke, the
junior varsity grapplers gained little
more than experience in dropping
matches 29-3 to Duke and 31-3 to
N. C. State.

Jim Burton was the only JV win-
ner in the State match as he edged
his 130-pound opponent, 7-6. Bruce
Builder, in the 123 pound class, lost
his match in the third period on
riding time, by the close score, 11-10.

Graeme Bannerman and Jim Tyler,
in the 147 and 167 pound classes re-
spectively, both lost close matches.
Bannerman lost 10-8 as his oppon-
ent put on a third period surge
to down the W&L man, while Tyler
battled his man to an 11-7 score

before getting caught and pinned in|

the second period.

In the Duke match, Bannerman
gained Washington and Lee’s only
victory by outpointing his oppon-
ent, 5-1. Tom Crenshaw, General
heavyweight fought a good match
and was leading 5-4, before getting
pinned,

Although his junior varsity prote-
ges did not fare too well on this
trip, Coach Miller pointed out that
the match experience will actually
be of more importance to many of
his freshmen than the score.

| State, but the men from Raleigh
gained 13 points in the three re-
maining bouts to capture the match,
19-13.

With only a week of practice since
exams, the W&L wrestlers seemed
to suffer from lack of conditioning.
Musick and Winfield were particu-
larly impressive, however, as Musick
pinned his opponent in 36 seconds
and Winfield built up a 14-3 point
advantage before gaining the fall
in his 157 pound bout.

From State the Washington and
Lee team journeyed to nearby Duke
(who had recently beaten N. C.
State) where Coach Dick Miller’s
crew came alive and trounced the
favored Blue Devils, 21-13.

Before Duke could gain a decision,
W&L amassed 13 points with West,
in the 123 pound class, gaining a
7-4 win, Musick a forfeit, and Kem-
ble White, a much improved 137
pounder, a second period pin.

Jamie Andrew then lost his 147
pound match to Duke’s Bob Holder,
but Winfield came back to win his
seventh match of the season, 9-3.
Captain Herb Smith added five more
match points in his 177 pound match
by pinning Warren Seagreaves in the
first period.

Students Confer

(Continued from page 2)

Each of the four men involved
dealt with their special areas of the
civil rights issue: Forman with non-
violent action, Hill with the employ-
ment dilemma among Negros, Higgs
with the civil rights bill, and the
justice department representative
with the problem of judicial involve-
ment in Southern disputes.

Delegates Saturday afternoon par-
ticipated in small seminars on var-
ious areas of civil rights, including
education, non-violence, prejudice,
and the role of the federal govern-
ment.

The conference closed Sunday
morning with a rather disjointed and
poorly organized delivery by Howard
Zinn, Southern Historian and leader
of SNCC.

The singularly most important

of real estate value, which none of
the homeowners on the lane can
financially afford).

Blockbuster Activities
As the Atlantic said of Matt Jones,

his “impulsiveness, his hitting out, |

and later his self-doubts and renun-
ciation are what give this books its
integrity.” The story moves through
the trials which all the families on
the lane must face, the abuse which
Winter must take, and the nefarious
activities of the blockbuster—in this
case, a Negro who tries to convince
the homeowners on the lane to sell
at cheap prices so that he may in
turn sell the homes to Negroes at
an immense profit.

Peaceful Lane is a tense, violent
novel—far from great, but highly
interesting. It does not bring any
new message to the fore—it leaves
the problem of the Negroes mixing
in “exclusive” white neighborhoods
right where it is now. But it opens
up the problem very well and gives
it a needed airing—and the reactions
which the people on Peaceable Lane
have are probably realistically sug-
guested. As Zack Gold, Matt’s next
door neighbor ruefully remarked in
the novel: “The thing I hate to re-
member is that it opened up the
weakness and meanness in all of us.”

anymore.”

I have found that the best way
(possibly the only way) to get to
know “Omni” is to ask him about
his experiences as a night-watchman.
At first he may seem reluctant to
talk about them, but soon he can
be coaxed into some great tales.
One of the best is about the night
he caught some students painting
“Old George” on top of Washington
Hall. Then there was the night he
caught some townies looting cars
parked around the campus. I asked
him if they put up much of a fight.
He thought for a minute and an-
swered, “I don’t really know. I just
got the license number and the po-
lice brought them in. They didn’t
even thank me for it either.”

Then there was the night Palmer
caught them painting “Old Cypress,”
as he calls the well-known statute.
The best of his stories unfortunately
can not be printed here. There is
one about the VMI cadet and his
date who....But then, you had bet-
ter ask Palmer himself.

thing about the conference was that
it revealed just how big and intense
is the civil rights movement. The
dedication o fie people involved in
the various organizations borders
on—and, indeed often becomes—
fanaticism.

I came away convinced that the
American Negro simply is not going
to tolerate the indignation of dis-
crimination much longer. Their pa-
tience seems to be runing short, and
their militancy is increasing. Some
of the graups such as the NAACP,
CORE, and SCEF are struggling to
remove inequality and discriminatory
practices within the framework of
the American Structure. Others—
such as Worthy’s Freedom, Now Par-
ty and the Black Muslims des-
paired of the white man’s callous-
ness and are turning increasingly
to more radical channels of expres-
sion,

The upheavals of the last year,
especially, will get worse before they |
get better. At present, most Negro
leaders seem to have asserred the
situation and are aware of the com-
plexities of social change. Most of
them, in fact, are working with the
white community to realize the
American ideal of equality. Others—
and their numbers are growing—
have withdrawn from a harsh reality
and are themselves contributing de-
structively to the whole dilemma of
racial relations.

In the next few weeks I shall at-
tempt to explore the position of the
various groups involved in the civil
rights movement and to analyze the
essential issues which are to be con-
fronted.

done so, it would have been appar-

He, and those advising him, have
made mistakes which probably cost
him some support. A question which
the taciturn Granite Staters are yet
unwilling to answer is: has the per-
sonal exposure to the Senator’s
views—especially his hard line for-
eign policy—turned them from him?
Later columns will explore this
problem, but as the cost of US.

Many argue, however, that this
same candor wihch endears him to
many voters causes others to react
increduously. For Barry Gold-
wate—like him or not—is demand-
ing of Americans something which
other presidential aspirants have
preferred we not do: think.

His dynamic conservatism is chal-
lenging the root assumptions of
contemporary political thought—as-
sumptions which have remained
clothed in a sacred shroud since
the 1930’s. To a people who have
become accustomed to the vargaries
and evasions of modern politicians
this is a large order.

viewers. But the writer and di-
rector were not satisfied with a
bare outline. Rather they have filled
the film with clever, interesting, and
amusing scenes—some of which are
integral to the plot and others which
are not, but are simply too good to
leave out.

There are also many superb lines.
One of the best occurrs with Grant
and Hepburn riding around. He asks
her if she would like to see where he
got his tattoo. She says that she
would like to very much, to which he
replies he will take her there some-
time.

Or, when Hepburn is trying to talk
Grant into coming into her room,
and he is refusing, she says “You
know what’s wrong with you?”
When Grant asks, “What?” she re-
plies “Nothing.”

Superb Combination |

real reason for the film’s success. I

all-white college. His priority list of
colleges, assuming he wants to at-
tend an integrated college, would in-
clude those institutions which have
met the integration problem in the
past and overcome it. Intelligent
Negroes from any high school can
gain admission to Dartmouth,
Princeton, Bowdoin, or Amherst—
where they can persue their aca-
demic interest without the pressure
of white racists.

This brought the conversation
around full-scale to Dr. Jenk’s orig-
inal question: is it possible for there
to be any more than token integra-
tion at Washington and Lee? Will
we not be falling in with the inev-
itable stream of the 1960’s when we
do announce the falling of the race
barrier here?

this case. “The establishment of a
regional warehouse exclusively for
the storage of criminal exhibits or
the use of more photographs are
possible solutions,” Partington sug-
gested in his article. It is obvious
that if the exhibits are not kept,
“an unmerited acquittal may well
result.” Partington added that if ex-
hibits are not kept, there must at
least be uniform statutes placing a
limitation on the length of time after
after a trial that an appeal could be
made.

Partington is president of the

is a member of Phi Gamma Delta

burn. Their personalities carry the
film in that the film seems to have
been drawn to fit them. Here, in
“Charade,” is one of those rare times
when a star can be superior to an
actor.

This is not to decry the others
who have come together for this ef-
fort. Indeed, the direction is fast
and lively and leads one into a feel-
ing of light suspense. The support-
ing actors are each excellent in their
parts. And the music is by Mancini.
Perhaps the best one can say about
the film is that, finally, a movie
has been made in which Mancini’s
music is not the best thing.

which I haven’t seen. But I will see
it and I imagine I am safe in recom-

Grapplers Beaten By NCS;

Come Back To Beat Duke
(Continued from page 3)

trip, General heavywegiht, Warren
Stewart, led Duke’s Luke Sharpe,
4-1, before getting caught and pin-
ned by the 6-6, 245 pounder. Stew-
art had “Big Look from Dook” in
a cradle hold and came very close
to pinning Sharpe, but the W&L
wrestler’s lack of size hampered him
and allowed the bigger man to
escape.

The split in these two matches
gives the Mink grapplers a 5-2-1
seasonal record with several im-
portant matches remaining. This sat-
urday W&L meets Franklin and
Marshall College in Doremus Gym-
nasium at 8:00 in a match that could
prove very exciting since F&M pro-
vided one of the General’s two
wrestling losses last year.

CLUB &
CAMPUS

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, ESQUIRE'S Fashion Director

By now you're back at the salt mines after the holidays—and quite
likely in the mid-season doldrums! Your wardrobe’s probably in the
doldrums, too—standing in the need of replenishment. Here are
some suggestions for putting a little new life and color into that closet!

   

BREATHES THERE A MAN —with
soul so dead he really thinks he’s got
enough sweaters? Well, if you’re among the
‘sweatered souls who are very much alive
to the need, you might consider a camel
hair (or camel color) cardigan—guaran-
teed to go-with-everything! Or you might
' like to turn turtle, in one of the new flat-
knit (jersey-textured) sweaters with the
popular oversize turtle neck. Or perhaps
you'd prefer a bulky ski-type pullover pat-
terned with Norwegian designs — great
even if you never get nearer the slopes than
the Student Union! Any one of these would
give you a lift!

 

THE VEST’S THE BEST—way to revitalize a suit or sport-
jacket-and-slacks you’ve grown tired of. Color is your cue here, with
a wide range of bright flannel vests that will blend or contrast—vivid
reds, brilliant yellow or gold, rich mossy green and—stop me if
you’ve heard this!—the ever-present camel! A colorful Tattersall
check vest is an even more versatile addition to the weary wardrobe,
as it combines well with a variety of colors and fabrics for a smart,
sporting look.

MUFFLED UP TO THE EYES— is a good way to be this sea-
son—if it’s one of those 5-foot knitted mufflers! New they’re not—
we cribbed them from the inmates of English colleges and “public
schools,” where they’ve been worn since the days of Dickens. Ribbed
or flat-knit in soft Shetland wool, these mufflers are often wide-
striped—usually in school colors—though they’re available in solids
as well. Worn without a topcoat—weather permitting—is the British
way, with the long end thrown carelessly over the left shoulder. For
more conservative occasions, think about a soft cashmere muffler in
muted tones, or an authentic tartan to go with your topcoat,

YOU'LL GET A BELT—maybe two—out of the latest! Because
the latest is the reversible fabric belt, solid-color twill on one side,
striped on the other. Or you can add color to your mid-section with
a bright tartan belt, leather-backed to wear well. And bold, blazer
stripes will be running rings around your waist, too, in combinations
like scarlet and white on an olive twill background.

WILD AND WOOLY — is the Word on winter shirts! They may
be either all-wool or a practical blend of polyester fibers and wool
for the warmth you may need during the wintry weeks ahead. They're
styled exactly like your dress shirts—complete to the button-down
collar bit. Look for them in wild, punchy colors and tartans (authen-
tic or otherwise) and jazz.up those bleak, January days!

 

 

 

 

 

AND SO TO BED—or to bull session. Whatever your after-
hours activities, you’ve probably already discovered that those drafty
dormitory corridors can be quite a shock when you're unprepared!
But you can beat the draft if you’ve got a warm flannel robe. Stand-
ard, conservative styling is best—perhaps with contrasting piping—
in practical, dark shades or bright tartan plaids. Barefoot in the halls
—cold and uncarpeted as they are—will lead only to amputation!
Slippers are a better idea, preferably plain, moccasin-style slip-ons.
And if you’re really in the northern latitudes, consider slippers lined
with shearling to fight the frostbite!

Next month we'll keep you in style for active sports—North and

 

South, from ski to shining sea—and intermediate stops. See you then!
