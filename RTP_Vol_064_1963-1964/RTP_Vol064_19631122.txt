PRESIDENT ASSASSINATED IN DALLAS

 

Faculty Opinion Divided
On Assimilation Committee

By SYD LEWIS

Will Washington and Lee’s con- |

ventional dress be able to stand the)

powerful forces toward change in|

the 1960’s? Since World War II

dress at Washington and Lee has |
become increasingly lax.

Not too many years ago it was
considered improper to be seen |
without a vest; however, starting |
after the war with the innovation
of khaki’s and continuing into the
sixties with the levi fad, conven-
tional dress has deteriorated sub-
stantially. The lack of enthusiasm
for the enforcement of this old tra-
dition was demonstrated in the Tues-
day Ring-tum Phi in a letter signed
by members of the EC and assimila-
tion committee asking for the abol-
ishment of the assimilation commit-
tee—the one organization on campus
devoted to re-enforcing conventional
dress.

In an interview of ten  pro-
fessors, 50 per cent favored the
abolition of the Assimilation Com-
mittee. Seventy per cent thought
that dress would become more casual
than it already is and 90 per cent felt
that the alumni would be against the
proposal.

Many of those professors who
favored the abolishment of the as-
similation committee thought that
students would not take advantage
of the added freedom to any great
degree and that conventional dress
would really become the tradition
that it is heralded to be while
others felt that tradition was out-
dated and ought to be forgotten if
students did not support it.

It was mentioned that Washington
and Lee’s prestige is not due at all
to the manner of dress and other
Eastern universities probably had no
idea that the tradition was still in
existence at W&L.

Those who were not in favor of
the abandonment of the committee
had derogatory comments about the
letter in the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
and about the committee members.
One professor remarked that the As-
similation Committee was enforcing
a tradition of sorts not a rule, for
an analogy can be made beteen con-
ventional dress and the honor sys-
tem. Both need enforcing commit-
tees although they both should be
considered a tradition.

Furthermore, faculty members
felt that anyone who was against
the committee certainly had no
business on the Assimilation Com-
mittee and should resign imme-
diately if he signed the recent let-
ter. Also, there was some doubt
about certain signers of the letter
who said in the letter their only
motive in abolishing the Assimila-
tion Committee was to stop arbi-
trary enforcement while what they
really wanted was to abolish con-
ventional dress altogether.

 

In brief, there is a growing dis-

satisfaction about how conventional
dress is enforced. There are also
students who would like to do away
with coat and tie attire altogether;
however, there still remain many
students and certainly a large ma-

| jority of alumni who would not like

| to, in any way, make dress stand-
ards any less formal than they are
now.

Even those who are in favor of
conventional dress and want it con-
tinued as a tradition agree that
there are basic defficiencies in the
Assimilation Committee. What is the
solution? Probably this question has
no answer; however, it seems that
total abolishment of the Assimila-
tion Committee might be a bad rish
to take at this time.

Noted Critic
Hugh Kenner
Speaks Dec. 5

By RANDY FINGLAND

Hugh Kenner, a noted critic of
modern literature, will speak in du-
Pont Auditorium on December 5,
at 8:15. His talk will be sponsored
by the Seminars in Literature Com-
mittee.

Mr. Kenner, born in Peterborough,
Ontario, on January 7, 1923, attended
the University of Tronto where he
was a gold medalist in English in
1945. After obtaining his M.A. in
1946, he taught for two years at
Assumption College, Windsor, On-
tario. He worked on his Ph.D. at
Yale, receiving it in 1950. He is now
chairman of the English Department
at Santa Barbara College of the
University of California. He is mar-
ried and has five children.

This year Mr. Kenner is a Visit-
ing Professor at the University of
Virginia.

There are six critical works by

 

Mr. Kenner: The Poetry of Ezra
Pound (1951), Wyndham Lewis
(1954), Dublin’s Joyce (1956),

Gnomon: Essays on Contemporary
Literature (1958), The Art of Poetry
(1959, The Invisible Poet: T. S. Eliot
(1959), and Samuel Beckett (1961).

Mr. Kenner is a Contributing Edi-
tor of Poetry which is published in
Chicago and an advisory editor of
Spectrum which is published in
Santa Barbara. He has composed at
least eight articles and reviews for
various American and British mag-
azines, and sereval have appeared in
Shenandoah.

In 1956 Mr. Kenner traveled to
London to speak to the Royal So-
ciety of Literature.

His current endeavor is a book
on William Carlos Williams.

The topic on which Dr. Kenner
will speak is still unknown. The
Seminars in Literature Comimttee
cordially invites all interested stu-
dents.

 

 

The world was alarmed today by the sudden assasination of
President Kennedy at 1:25 in Dallas. Taken to the hospital in
critical condition, the Chief Executive died at 2:00 EST.

Vice-President Johnson, who was three cars behind Ken-
nedy in the motor parade, has been sworn into office as Ken-
nedy’s successor. John McCormick, president pro tempore of
the Senate, would have become president had Johnson been

killed also.

Police in Dallas have seized both 24-year-old Lee H. Os-
wald and a 30-year-old unidentified man as suspects.

 

Boorman To Talk
On Red Bloc Split

Tonight at 8 o'clock Howard L.
Boorman, a research specialist at
Columbia University, will speak in
duPont Auditorium. The subject of
his lecture will be “The Sino-Soviet
Conflict: A Retrospective Survey.”
The lecture is being sponsored by
the W&L department of history in
cooperation with the University cen-
ter in Virginia.

Tonight’s talk is the last in a series
of lectures in Virginia schools un-
der the University Center program.
He has spoken this week at Ran-
dolph-Macon, Mary Baldwin, the
University of Virginia and Mary
Washington.

Boorman is director of Columbia’s
Research Project on Men and Poli-
tics in Modern China. Educated at
the University of Wisconsin and
Yale, Boorman was an officer of the
United States Foreign Service from
1947 to 1955. He was serving at
Peking when the Chinese Commun-
ist entered that city in 1949, and
later spent four years on the staff
of the American Consulate General
in Hong Kong.

In 1945-55 he was awarded a
Rockefeller Public Service Award.
In 1955 he joined t the staff of Colum-

Is The W&L Fraternity System

By Warren Montgomery

When one reads or hears
something about fraternities,
it is almost always disparaging.
In almost any controversial is-

sue, the fraternal point of
view is seldom discussed while
the anti-fraternity aspects of the
issues are usually considered in de-
tail. As a result,
the public image
of the national
| fraternity system
one-side and
) misleading.

In order to dis-
' cuss fraternities
fairly, however, it
# is necessary to
| give the fraternal
point of view on
such argumenta-
tive topics as dis-
pledging activities, na-

| is

crimination,

tional control, scholarship, feeding
and housing facilities, and _ social
snobbery.

 

Discrimination vs. Rights

The subject of racial and relig-
ious discrimination is particularly
loaded; within the last five years,
numerous institution-chapter and
national-chapter splits have occurred
over it. No fraternity will go so
far as to state that discrimination
on the basis of presumed White-
Protestant superiority is that or-
ganization’ss membership policy.
Nevertheless, most fraternal groups
maintain, with reason, that as pri-
vate social organizations, they have
an inherent right to elect to mem-
bership those whom they please, no
matter what the reason. No univer-
sity has the right to legislate on
whom its students will like and
take as friends.

Rallies

Pledging activities, especially those
involving unconstructive “hell-rais-
ing,’ are also under severe criti-
cism. Viewed impersonally, this sort
of activity is unjustifiable because
of the loss of study time and sleep
to the pledge. To many fraternity
men, though, their respective or-

 

ganizations mean a great deal more
to them than just an eating club.

Because they greatly value their
membership, they do not want to
confer it on anyone lightly. A

pledge’s willingness to sacrifice his
time and sleep to become a mem-

 

Editor’s note: Do _ fraternities
have a right to be exclusive? Are
“unconstructive, ‘hell-raising’” ral-
lies congruous with fraternity
ideals? Does fraternity life detract
from the academic sphere. In
this article, the conclusion of a
four-part series, Associate Editor
Warren Montgomery attempts to

portray the fraternity viewpoint
on such contemporary issues of
controversy.

 

ber is accordingly taken as sufficient
proof that he does not consider
membership to be of minor value.

National fraternity organizations
are often depicted as domineering
outfits of hidebound old alumni by
critics of the system. In the first

charge of the preparation of a bio-
graphical dictionary on twentieth-
century China.

He is the co-author of Moscow-
Peking Axis and a contributor to
a number of journals.

As his title suggests, Boorman
will discuss the recent conflict of
interests between the Moscow and
the Peking Communist governments.
He will offer an analysis of these
differences and an exploration of
how they came about.

He is also expected to explore their
meaning in the context of inter-
national affairs and their meaning
as far as the United States is con-
cerned. He will offer his opinion as
to how deep these differences are
and the chances of reconciliation of
the differences .

Boorman has edited “Contempor-
ary China and the Chinese” (The
Annals of the American Academy
of Political Social Science, January
1959) and “The Biographical Ap-
proach to Chinese History,” which
appeared in the Journal of Asian

He has also written on

Justifiable?

al staffs are hidebound, national or-
ganizations are basically democratic,
and national action usually reflects
undergraduate will. Then too, a fra-
ternity must have a coherent nation-
al bond if it is to preserve the uni-
formity in ideals and ritual which
make it a fraternal rather than so-
cial organization.
Fraternities vs. Grades

The time-honored precept that
fraternity men are poor scholars can
no longer be accepted. On many
campuses, as on ours, the all-frater-
nity average is above the all-men’s
average, indicating that fraternity
men make better grades than inde-
pendents. In a survey of the eigh-
teen fraternities at W&L, it was
found that sixteen of the national
organizations have scholarship pro-
grams of some sort. These programs,
along with academic requirements
for initiation and individual chapter
scholarship programs, do much to
keep fraternity academic ratings
high.

(Death Came at 2 PM EST
Johnson Becomes President

President Kennedy died today a short time after he was
shot in Dallas. An assassin shot both the President and Texas
Governor Conally as their motorcade moved through the out-

skirts of the city.

The President and Conally were rushed to a nearby hos-

Clark Named
Top Debater

Jay Clark, captain of the W&L
debate team was chosen best speak-
er in the Delta Sigma Rho-Tau
Kappa Alpha District 3 debate tour-
nament held last week-end at Wil-
liam and Mary in Williamsburg. He
was named first out of fifty-six de-
baters, representing ten Virginia and
District of Columbia colleges and
universities.

Clark also won first place as the
best affirmative team in the tourna-
ment debating with Jack Eure of
Suffolk, Virginia. They won first
place by winning three out of four
debates on the national debate ques-
tion. Eure tied for second place in
the speaker ratings, finishing one
point behind Clark.

Senior Debaters

Both Clark and Eure are senior
debaters. As a freshman debater
in 1960-61, Clark won more debate
awards than anyone else at W&lL.
He was a member of the State
Championship Debate Team both in
1960 and 1961.

On the negative side of the tour-
nament, Tabor Novak and Roy Pow-
ell, also won three out of four de-
bates, but finished behind a nega-
tive team from George Washington
that had a perfect record of four
out of four.

Steve Smith, one of four other de-
baters from W&L participating in
the tournament, was elected secre-
tary of the mid-Atlantic debating
organization. He is one of three Tau
Kappa Alpha-Delta Sigma Rho of-
ficers in region 3,

*rites of the Church to Kennedy. It

was reported that blood transfusions
were given to the President and
that he was in a critical condition,
but in only a few minutes govern-
ment sources confirmed his death.

The sniper fired on the President’s
motorcade as it entered a triple
underpass leading to a freeway.
Kennedy slumped face-down into
the car. Mrs. Kennedy, who was
not hurt, jumped up, grabbed him,
and tried to hold up his head. Mrs.
Kennedy was reported to be stun-
ned.

The Associated Press said that
there was blood on the President’s
head. Connally was reported shot in
the chest and the head. The Pres-
ident died at 2 p.m. Eastern Stand-
ard Time.

Police immediately spread a drag-
net around Dallas in search for the
assassin. At least one suspect was
reported to have been apprehended.

First Report of Death

First word of the President’s
death came from the two priests
who had been summoned to give
the last rites. Acting White House
News Secretary Malcolm Kilduff
released official confirmation and
stated that Kennedy had died of a
gunshot wound in the brain.

Vice president Johnson was rid-
ing three cars behind the President.
Reports that he was also wounded
were denied and soon after the
President’s death Johnson left the
hospital.

After the shooting pandemonium
broke loose at the scene. Secret
Service agents waved the motorcade
to the nearby Parkland Hospital but
it took five minutes to reach the
emergency entrance.

Several witnesses have said that
Kennedy was fired on from an up-
per window of a warehouse which
commanded an open view of the
presidential car.

The Senate, which was in session
with Teddy Kennedy presiding
when the news of the assassination
reached Washington, recessed imme-
diately.

Richmond Writer To Speak
On ‘Politics In Virginia’

Monday, November 25, Mr. Charles
McDowell will speak at Washington
and Lee on the topic “Virginia Poli-
tics.” His talk will be given in
Lee Chapel at 7:30.

Immediately following his speech,
Mr. McDowell will hold a discussion

n “trends and power bloes in Vir-

ginia polities.” This discussion will
be held in Room 8 of Newcomb Hall,
and all interested students are in-
vited to attend.

Mr. McDowell is a nationally syn-
dicated columnist, particularly well-
known for his work on the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch. His column
deals primarily with politics from a
humorous point of view. In 1960, Mr.

 

McDowell received the National
Headliners’ Award for the most hu-
morous column.

Besides his newspaper work, Mr.
McDowell has had two collections
of his columns published in book
form. The first was One Thing After
Another, published in 1960, and the
second, What Did You Have in
Mind?, published in 1963.

Mr. McDowell’s father is a Profes-
sor of Law at W&L, and Mr. Mc-
Dowell himself is a W&L graduate.
He attended W&L immediately fol-
lowing the close of World War II,
and his freshman year, began writ-
ing for The Columns, the Wé&l.
newspaper at that time. His soph-
omore year, he became editor of
this publication. When the Ring-
tum Phi came back into existence
his junior year, he wrote a column
on this publication also. This same
year, he worked on the Calyx staff,
was an executive Committee mem-
ber, and wrote for the Southern
Collegian. Mr. McDowell, in his sen-
ior year was elected president of
the Publications Board. He was also
a member of the Washington Liter-
ary Society, and of the Editorial
Board.

Mr. McDowell’s talk is being
jointly sponsored by Colonel Gil-
liam of VMI, and Dr. Colvin of
W&L, through the auspices of the
NCEP, the National Committee for
Edueation in Politics. This is a non-
partisan organization supported by
a Ford Foundation grant, the pur-
pose of which is to interest students
in practical polities.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Being Realistic

Should we get rid of the Assimilation Committee? Last
Tuesday a letter signed by several students and published in
the Ring-tum Phi indicated that this is what we should do to
strengthen conventional dress. Perhaps the authors of the
letter were merely trying to shock us, perhaps they were per-
fectly sincere. At any rate, the campus opinion overall seems
to be that to abolish the Assimilation Committee would be to
abolish conventional dress.

Why, we inquired of a number of students, would the
abolition of the Committee be that drastic a step? The general
reply: we are too lazy (too “human”) to put on a coat and
tie every day without having some authority that says we have
to. As one student commented, ‘Once a few students begin to
get away with wearing whatever they want to, without being
penalized, then everyone is going to say ‘What the heck’ and
start breaking down.”

This sort of feeling does not mean we don’t want the
tradition. Students on the whole like the idea of conventional
dress, but they lack the necessary self-discipline to observe it
faithfully under their own steam. It’s a very realistic approach:
we as individuals are not always able to “generate’”’ our own mo-
tivation to do what we know we ought to. There is constantly
the need for some outside force or pressure to keep us going.
This principle holds true not just for the Assimilation Commit-
tee, but for grades, limited cuts, the E.C. judiciary, etc. Ideally
there should be no need for any of these. In reality, if we get
rid of them, we get rid of what they have been instituted to

enforce.

Reader Questions Cockshutt
On College Independence

Dear Sir,

The column by Mr. Rod Cockshutt
in the Friday, November 15, edition
has raised some interesting ques-
tions.

Mr. Cockshutt asserted that an
independent university was primar-
ily distinguished by its “freedom,”
which he defines, as “the freedom of
professors to teach their subjects as
they choose to; the freedom of stu-
dents to follow the truth wherever
and however it might lead them; the
freedom of the university as a whole
to move boldly, to experiment, to
play with new ideas—...”

He then concluded that for var-
ious reasons—which apparently
condense to the Board of Trustees’
failure to do what Mr. Cockshutt
thought they ought to do—Wash-
ington and Lee was not truly inde-
pendent, being governed instead
by “a self-perpetuating oligarchy.”

But obviously a university cannot
function in a vacuum — someone
must bear the ultimate responsibility
for the decisions: what courses will
be taught, who will teach them, who
will be fired for not teaching them
properly, to whom will the univer-
sity make available its facilities,
etc. If not the Board of Trustees,
whom?

Mr. Cockshutt is concerned that
“everything that matters here then
is really at the mercy of their (Board
of Trustees) economic, social and po-
litical views.” At the mercy of whose
views should it be? A faculty com-
mittee? The University President?
A club of fifteen twenty-year-old
students? Or Mr. Cockshutt?

Mr. Cockshutt seems to be of the
opinion that a university is to al-
low its facilities to be used by
anyone and everyone to whom
some group of students extends an
invitation? Maybe the Board was
wrong in its refusal to allow Mar-
tin Luther King to speak, but
does it follow that it should allow
anyone to speak? Assuming that
our society, and thus our educa-
tional institutions, advance with
time and learn from the lessons
of history, shouldn’t our educa-

 

tion—in and out of the classroom—
be guided by this experience?

Surely Washington and Lee would
not hire an English professor who
refused to include William Shakes-
peare in an English course. But
would it compel him to include some
lesser light? And why should a uni-
versity open its doors to any con-
temporary figure because of the
fancy of some curious students?
Need our facilities be made available
to one—such as George Lincoln
Rockwell—who obviously has noth-
ing to offer to serious study?

It seems too obvious for contra~-
diction that in the pursuit of know-
ledge a student has to be guided to
some degree, by the “economic, so-
cial, and political views” of some-
body.

What seems to bother Mr. Cock-
shutt is not the fact that the Board
of Trustees decides, but what it de-
cides. One gets the impression that
Mr. Cockshutt would be gloriously
happy if the Board of Trustees, in
a flurry of enlightenment, allowed
Martin Luther King, George Lincoln
Rockwell, and Gus Hall to speak at
the University to an integrated au-
dience of Washington and Lee stu-
dents.

Maybe they should. But the de-
cision is not to be mine or Mr.
Cockshutt’s, but rather is reserved
to those possessed of superior wis-
dom and experience. If not the
Board of Trustees, then certainly
the Board of Somebody.

A university which is “free” and
“independent” of State or religious
control must still operate within a
framework that is fashioned in some
manner short of student anarchy—
the results of which can be observed
in the chaotic conditions at the Uni-
versity of Caracas in Venezuela or
at the Sorbonne in Paris. Though we
may quarrel with the policy, and
even with those designated to de-
termine it, we should not be so ir-
rational as to argue that there should
be none.

GOP Nomination Is Within Reach
Of Swelling Goldwater Supporters

Editor’s Note: This article is
the first of a series on Republican
presidential _ possibilities. | Next
spring Washington and Lee will
nominate its own Republican can-
didate for the White House, the
W&L Mock Convention preceding
that of the professionals in San
Francisco by several months.

By STEVE SMITH
Managing Editor

Although Gov. Rockefeller has now
jumped off to a commanding lead
in speech-making and hand-shaking,
Sen. Barry Goldwater maintains
what may be an unbeatable lead in
pledged votes for the Republican
presidential nomination.

Leaders of the drive to draft Sen.
Goldwater for the nomination now
claim 500 of the 655 votes needed
to nominate at the convention. Still
Goldwater, the only candidate be-
ing actively supported by a W&L
student organization, refuses to de-
clare his candidacy.

Perhaps he’s waiting until the Na-
tional Draft Goldwater Committee
can promise him all 655 votes he
needs. Indications from all over the
country are that even this is not
out of the question.

 

 

A 13-State Rally

A meeting two weeks ago of
Southern GOP leaders was convinc-
ing proof of the Goldwater claim to
a “solid South” at the party’s con-
vention. Supposedly a Republican
leadership conference, the meeting
in Charleston, South Carolina, was
actually a 13-state Goldwater rally.
These 13 states— the 11 deep South
states plus Kentucky and West Vir-
ginia—have 317 of the 655 votes
Goldwater will need to be nominat-
ed. The unquestionable loyalty of the
South is the starting point for the
Goldwater boom.

Mr. Conservative can also, ap-
parently, count on nearly all the
Southwestern votes at the con-
vention. From the one big south-
western state, Texas, Sen. John
Tower is attempting to lead a rush
to Goldwater (just as Goldwater
helped Tower to be elected Sena-
tor). Texas Republican Chairman
Peter O’Donnell heads the Nation-
al Draft Goldwater movement. If
the Southwest can be pulled in,
and this is probable, then the
nomination could be clinched by
votes from the Midwest GOP,
the ancient stronghold of another

 

Mr. Conservative, Robert Taft.

Even though Goldwater conserva-
tism is a little extreme for many
midwest conservatives, he stands to
draw their votes because of their
fear of the very liberal Gov. Rocke-
feller. Still, Goldwater is on shaky
ground in such states as Ohio and
Michigan, where his espousal of
right-to-work laws promises to unite
the all-powerful labor unions against
him. Goldwater has also alienated
many midwestern farmers by his
opposition to the continuation of
farm subsidies.

Only a Bandwagon?

Obviously Goldwater will enter
the convention next July with an
excellent chance of receiving the
requisite number of votes. Is the
strength he now shows deep-rooted,
or is it a mere bandwagon display
being put on by a few enthusiasts?
In the South, and probably in the
Southwest, Goldwater’s strength is
unshakable. But unlooked-for set-
backs or the availability of a com-
promise candidate such as Nixon
might cost Goldwater most of his
more moderate support.

In the event of a convention dead-
lock with Rockefeller, Goldwater

Part Four: The Fraternity System

 

Fraternities’ Viewpoint Expressed

(Continued from page 1)

University Meddling
Many institutions are dissatisfied
with fraternity housing and feeding
facilities, and some resort to such
devices as housing fraternities in
dormitory sections and requiring
payment by students for institution-
al food provided by the university
or by a contracted catering corpor-
ation. In doing so, a university ig-
nores two facts: its business is the
education of young men—not the
regulation of their daily lives; and
most students would prefer to eat
and live at the fraternity house,
where they can have more and better
food and live away from the direct

influence of the university.

Fraternities are accused of social
snobbery on the grounds that they
exclude some students who would
like to belong. This situation is one
of the most regrettable things about
the fraternity system, but there is
no way to change it without de-
stroying the fraternity as a group
of congenial people voluntarily as-
sociated with one another. Most
fraternity members feel that the
idea of a fraternity as a group of
friends instead of an impersonal or-
ganization is more important than
trying to include everyone. Open
parties and social membership are
well meaning attempts of the fra-
ternities to improve this situation.

Rushing

Two more criticisms that are level-
ed at fraternities are that they play
a “disproportionate role in under-
graduate life” and that they do not
give an incoming freshman enough
time to consider pledging before
starting rush week. For these two
things, fraternities can only offer
practical (but not idealistic) ex-
cuses. They play such a large role
in undergraduate life because they
want power and respectability, both
of which may be obtained by grasp-
ing control of campus organizations.
A desire to remain financially solv-
ent prompts the immediate rushing
system used here and elsewhere.

 

So far, this article has simply
tried to give the fraternity answer
to various aspects of the attack
against the system. There are, how-
ever, several very commendable
qualities of fraternities that are in-
dependent of the criticisms. In the
first place, fraternities provide a
valuable form of social life. Universi-
ties are unable to supply anything
more than mass social events. They
cannot, for instance, provide small,
more intimate parties as can frater-
nities, and they cannot or will not
provide them in the same quantities.
Nor are they able to provide trans-
portation and arranging of dates. The
fraternities can fulfill the social
needs of the students much more
adequately than the university could
ever hope to.

Character Development

Fraternities are a great character-
building influence too. In the words
of Julia Mott Hodge from an edi-
torial appearing in the Alpha Phi
Quarterly of 1897: “...in spite of
the inspiration university life affords
to broad thinking, there is often a
temptation to narrow living...
Absorbed in books, burdened, prob-
ably, with an excess of work, it is
easy for the conscientious student
to shut himself out from the hearts
and lives of his fellows, to live self-
ishly, and thus, in his own life, to
defeat the very end for which he
is studying so zealously.

“Fraternity life is useful in ob-
viating this danger. The constant
intercourse between the different
members, the possession of com-
mon interests, and the working
toward a common end, the mutual
demands for sympathy and aid, the
daily friction caused by clashing
interests and difference of dispo-
sition, the constant necessity of
continual forbearance and love, the
‘bearing one another’s burdens’
and the sharing of one another’s
joys, the giving up of individual
desires for the sake of others and
the society in general—all these
form but few of the many ways in

 

 

which fraternity life
deepens, enriches.”

broadens,

Finally, there is the matter of
brotherhood. Despite the pattern of
today’s social behavior which does
not admit sentiment and affection,
the normal freshman is left with a
great gap caused by the removal of
his family and friends. A fraternity,
through its associations which are
stronger than casual friendship, gives
the student a home, a sense of be-
longing, and the assurance that his
life is a matter of interest to others,
his fraternity brothers.

 

would be hard pressed to hold his
midwestern votes against Nixon or
a similarly moderate candidate, who
could attract support from indus-
trial elements but who could also
be supported by the conservatives.

Far West Doubtful

Goldwater support from other re-
gions is even more doubtful. In
California former Sen. William
Knowland is beating the conservative
drums and a powerful Rightest ele-
ment looks upon Goldwater as the
candidate who comes closest to its
views; but Goldwater will have to
concede millions of industrial and
urban votes in California and the
state GOP knows it. Knowland will
not be able to control the huge Cal-
ifornia delegation all the way.

In Oregon, popular liberal Gov.
Mark Hatfield can be expected to
cast a heavy weight against Gold-
water.

In the East there is scattered
Goldwater backing, but much of it
will succumb to the Rockefeller
wave which is only now starting to
roll after the turmoil over his di-
vorce and re-marriage. Goldwater
could, though, cramp Rocky’s style
painfully if he holds his present
lead in New Hampshire long enough
to win the opening round primary
in that state. New Hampshire Sen.
Morris Cotton is fighting a delaying
action against the vigorous Rocke-
feller backers until Goldwater gets
around to formally opening his own
campaign.

The sheer impetus of the Gold-
water drive will make it hard to
stop, but there is also the danger
that the conservative forces have
started too early and that their ef-
fort may “peak” long before the
convention. This possibility may be
what keeps Goldwater from an-
nouncing himself as a candidate.

A Magnetic Personality

Once the Arizonan does enter the
campaign, the strength of his per-
sonality could be all the extra push
needed by the conservative forces
already active. He has pre-empted
the image of the Old Frontiersman—
and remember that a coonskin cap
almost nominated Estes Kefauver in
1952.

It’s almost impossible not to like
Barry personally. He is magnetic
before a crowd. He has an elec-
tronic flagpole that raises the
American flag every day at sun-
rise. He is a Major General in
the U.S. Air Force Reserves.

In addition to the intangible as-
sets of personality, the Goldwater
steamroller is crammed with money
from conservatives who haven’t
really had anybody to give it to
in the last few campaigns. His or-
ganization is permanently entrench-
ed in the South and Southwest and
is moving into other areas in force.
The press has recently given him
more than enough publicity, al-
though it hasn’t all been favorable
by any means.

Nobody could be much surprised
if Goldwater sweeps into the July
convention, overcomes Rockefeller’s
liberal wing of the GOP, and Nixon
and Eisenhower’s me-too wing of
the party, and emerges as the next
opponent of the fearsome Kennedy
machine.

 

T. J. Hoggs

Views On

By BOB POTTS

Friday Columnist
In Birmingham, Alabama city
codes prohibit any restaurant to
serve whites and negroes in the
same room unless
they are separated
by a partition of
at least seven feet.
Durham, North
Carolina specifies
that such a wall
shall be “con-
structed of wood,

plaster, or brick

or like material,

and shall reach

Potts from floor to the
ceiling.

This concept of equ-wall but

separate has recently been defend-
ed by Thomas Jefferson Hoggs, the
noted antiquarian who finds two
main sanctions in American social
codes to support his case.

First, Hoggs recalls the passage
in Robert Frost’s “Mending Wall,”
Good fences make good neighbors
T. J. Hoggs dismissed the next lines,
Why do they make good neighbors?

Isn’t it
Where there are cows?

 

Defends
Constitution

Is irrelevant because there are no
cows, only Negroes. A salient point,
however, is that the North Carolina
law only specifies plaster or brick
with no mention of New England
field stone.

“Raise Clause”

From this, he moves to his second
supporting point, the Federal Con-
stitution. In Article I, section 8, the
“raise clause” appears. By this the
Federal Government is delegated
the power to raise armies, leaving,
obviously, the power to raise other
things, such as walls, to reside with-
in the states and their cities.

Also, Article IV, section 2 de-
clares, “The Citizens of each State
shall be entitled to all Privileges
and Immunities of Citizens in the
several States.” Hoggs interprets
this to mean that citizens are guar-
anteed immunity by law. He cites as
precedent the many state laws en-
forcing small pox innoculations and
extrapolites that walls provide im-
munization, thus are constitutional.

In summary, T. J. Hoggs finds the
Omnibus Civil Rights Bill, and es-
pecially the Public Accommodations
clause “a damnable piece of free-
masonery, Sir,!”

Generals To Meet Washington U. In Final

By LES GRANDIS

Tomorrow the Generals travel to
St. Louis to meet Washington Uni-
versity in W&L’s last game of the
season. On paper it seems that the
Generals will need somewhat more
than simply improved morale due to
an easy 36-12 victory over South-
western last week, to overcome the
Battlin‘ Bears of Coach Dave Pud-
dington.

Washington has just about every-
thing that allows a football coach
to sleep soundly the night before
a game. They are one of the biggest
teams the Generals play this year,
with the line averaging well over

 

200 pounds. Outstanding linemen

include tackle Rich Charlton (240
lbs.) and center Mike Thompson,
who goes both ways for the Bears.

Coach Puddington uses the three
platoon system similar to that of
W&L Coach Lee McLaughlin. The
Bears were undefeated until they
lost to Illinois and Sewanee the
past two weekends. Before the Se-
wanee game they were rated
eleventh in the nation among small
college teams.

Washington uses a strong “I” of-
fense, similar to that of Southern
Cal, based around quarterback
Claude Frazier, who doesn’t throw
often, but has completed 75 per
cent. In the Sewanee game he com-

 

pleted 9 out of ten. Frazier is also
a fine runner and utilizes the pass-
run option well. His prime target
is halfback Jon Mars, who is not
only a good receiver but is also one
of the fastest runners who will be
on the field. The Generals will also
be on the watch for power runner
Jim Powers, who can start at either
halfback or fullback.

W&L will be weak along the line
with guard Bill Angel and tackle
Bob Henley out with injuries.
Quarterback Brice Gamber, end
Starke Sydnor, and fullback Dan
Manson will also be sidelined be-
cause of injuries.

The Generals may have to resort

Booters Pick Jackson, Preston

By BILLY CANNON

Soccer Coach Joe Lyles announced
today that Bruce Jackson and Pete
Preston will be the co-captains of
next year’s booters.

Jackson, a Delt from Newington,
Conn., and Preston, a Phi Psi from
Chevy Chase, Md., are both juniors
with three years experience. Jackson
was an All-Stater last year while
playing his left halfback position.
Preston plays center halfback. Coach
Lyles explained, “under our three
deep system Pete is actually a full-
back.”

“Both boys have been outstand-
ing in the past three years,’ com-
mented Lyles. “I’m sure they’ll do
well next fall.”

There is no word as of yet on who
was chosen on the All-State team
this season. It is known that both
Jackson and Preston will be given
a long look when the “top 11”
is picked. They will be joined by

to the short pass as this appears to
be the only offense against which
Washington is weak. In fact, unless
our backs can find some way to
get through the big Bear line, the
aerial may be our only hope.

An interesting point was made in
this morning’s Richmond Times Dis-
patch: the Generals’ blue team half-
backs Henry Sackett and Stu Yoffe
have provided nearly 60 per cent of
the teams total rushing this season,
in carrying the ball 1,039 yards.

Sackett has gained 633 yards in
102 carries—the most for any Gen-
eral since Walt Michaels gained 712
in 1950 during W&L’s big time era.
Providing the other half of the Gen-
erals’ punch, Yoffe has gained 503
yards rushing while scoring 40
points. Sackett has scored 46 points
and was awarded the Ty Rauber
Homecoming Award for his out-
standing performance in the Centre
game October 12.

Swimmers To Begin Season

The Washington and Lee swim-
ming team is now in the process
of daily practices in order to get in
shape for its first meet, December3.
Although graduation last year took
nine men from his squad, Coach
Norris Eastman stated that he was
looking forward to an excellent sea-
son because of the overall depth of
his present squad, and the fine crop
of freshmen out for the team this
year.

Coach Eastman will rely heavily
this season upon his nine returning
lettermen. Senior co-captains Jim
Wallenstein and Walt McManus head
this list which also includes divers
Bruce Houghton and Dave Geer,
juniors John Wolfe, Bill Broaddus,

Larry Donat (B.S.E.E., 1960) is presently a marketing

which allow business machines to talk to each other in
their own language. No wonder he finds the job so in-

He moved to his present assignment after a three-month
course in five basic aspects of data — business machines,
systems analyses, computers, switching and marketing.

Larry was well prepared for his most recent promotion.

It is hoped that Lifter who has been
unable to attend practice because of
a mild case of hepatitis will be
able to start again following the
Thanksgiving break.

Freshmen who drew praise from
Coach Eastman for pre-season per-
formances were Gary Bokinsky, Bart
Taylor, Steve Lester, Bill Wildrick,
and Steve Lundy. In their only
trial so far the swimmers performed
well againt VMI.

He started off as an assistant engineer in the central office
equipment group, where he was responsible for maintain-
ing the operating efficiency of intricate switching equip-
ment. More time was spent in traffic, training, plant,
commercial and various schools, giving him a well-rounded

background in communications.

Larry Donat, like many young engineers, is impatient
to make things happen for his company and himself. There
are few places where such restlessness is more welcomed
or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.

Glee Club

With Miss Virginia

By FRED BISHOP

Doreas Campbell, this year’s Miss
Virginia, and the Washington and
Lee Glee Club, under the direction
of Mr. Robert Stewart, traveled to
Clifton Forge last night to present
a program before the Clifton Forge-
Covington Concert Guild.

The program consisted of two
parts, covering a wide variety of mu-
sic. Among the opening selections
were “College Friendships” Bach’s
“Now Let Every Tongue Adore
Thee,” Vivaldi’s “Domine Deus,” and
Handel’s “Hallelujah Amen.”

The Glee Club continued in a
lighter vein with the musical ver-
sion of e. e. cummings’ poem “sam
was a man,” and another contempor-
ary song “On an Island.”

Soloists Philip Booth and John
Baker followed with “Ten Thousand
Miles Away,” “This Ol’ Hammer,”
and “Without a Song.”

The spotlight next turned to Miss
Campbell, who sang selections from
My Fair Lady, “Romance” from
Romber’s Desert Song, and “Mueset-
ta’s Waltz Song” from Puccini’s La
Boheme. At the piano was Warren
Hopkins.

To conclude the first part of the
program, the Wé&L Brass Choir play-
ed several selections.

The second part of the program |
was launched with songs from musi- |
cal shows. Miss Campbell and John
Baker did a medley of songs from
West Side Story, which included
“Tonight,” “Maria,” “I Feel Pretty,”
They were backed by the Glee Club.
The program was closed with the
“W&L Swing.”

After the concert, the Glee Club,
Brass Choir, and Miss Campbell
were guests at a reception at the

President Kennedy Assassinated In Dallas Motorcade Today

(Continued from page 1)

The text of the speech which the
President was to deliver at a lunch-
eon today onl a short distance from
the hospital where he died, ironical-
ly asks Americans to stop paying so
much attention to the purveyors of
doom and the prophets of defeat.

Dr. Boorman

 

Speaks On Communist Rift

| “The notion that this nation is head-
ed for defeat through deficits or that
strength is but a matter of slogans
is nothing but just plain nonsense,”
reads the speech.
| A 30-30 rifie was apparently the

weapon used by the assassin.

Information was available concern-

 

ing a man being sought by the po-
lice. He is about 30 years old,
white, medium build, weighs about
165 pounds. Time of the slaying was
1:30 ETD.

Conally underwent chest surgery
at 2:30 EST. Doctors said he is not
out of danger but that signs of re-
covery are good.

At word of the assassination the

nation’s stock exchanges were
closed.
President Kennedy arrived in

Texas yesterday to the warm wel-
come of 300,000 people. He entered
Houston on a leg of his tour through
Texas during which he hoped to
settle factional feuding among var-

1ious Texas Democrats. He was at-
| tempting to steady the politically

shaky state which holds a crucial
26 electorial votes.

He opened his tour of Texas with
a strong defense of his space pro-
gram. Speaking in San Antonio, he
helped dedicate the six-million dol-
lar facility at Brooks Air Force
Base.

Last night in Houston, he was the
main speaker at a dinner in honor
of Rep. Albert Thomas. Tonight, the
President was supposed to have
been the guest of honor at a re-
ception given by Governor John
Connally.

With the President yesterday and
today were the Vice President,
Governor Connally, and Mrs. Ken-
nedy. President Kennedy was mak-
ing every effort to place himself
in front of the voters. President
Kennedy carried the state of Texas
by only a slight margin over Rich-

ard Nixon in the last Presidential
election.

President Kennedy and his wife
were to be the guests tonight of
Vice President and Mrs. Johnson
at their ranch near Johnson City.
The presidential party was to return
to Washington tomorrow.

Fact or Empty Words?

Kennedy’s speech in Dallas al-
ready had been released to news-
men. In his prepared remarks he
lashed out at the critics whom he
said confuse rhetoric with reality.

He said that ignorance and mis-
information, if allowed to prevail in
foreign police handicaps this coun-
try’s security.

Kennedy also took a jibe at critics
of his economic and financial poli-
cies. He said that they fear hordes
of civil servants more than they do
hordes of opposing armies.

Fort Worth Address

The president also did some cam-
paigning in the rain in Fort Worth.
Addressing a gathering of about
1,000 in a parking lot, he said there
was no faint hearts among those who
had turned out in the early morn-
ing rainfall. Referring to the first
lady, he said she wasn’t present
‘because it took her longer to get
organized in the morning. He added:
“But of course she looks better than
we do.”
