‘You in There’
In Lee Chapel

Documentary

A 30-minute documentary about
Washington and Lee University’s
newly-restored Lee Chapel will be
shown at 7 pm. this Friday over
WDBJ (Channel 7) in Roanoke.

“Assignment Seven”

The special program, entitled “As-
signment Seven: The Lee Chapel,”
will revolve around a tour of the
historic Chapel conducted by Earl
S. Mattingly, Washington and Lee’s
Treasurer. The documentary is one
of several programs planned _ this
year by Channel 7 staff members.

Narrator for the program will be
WDBJ’s Ron MacDonald, who also
is producer of the show. The pro-
gram is under the direction of Hugh
Downing. Jerry Bartmess was cam-
erman for the project.

Rededication

The special documentary is plan-
ned to coincide with preparations
for the formal rededication of Lee
Chapel, closed since June of 1962 for
extensive restoration, was re-opened
to the public in mid-August. The
restoration project | cost st $370,000.

Dance Plans Hold Up Well

Despite Raise In Price

Ed Croft, President of this year’s
Dance Board, said today that the
Dance Board has sold some 750
Dance Plans for 1963-64 session thus
far. This turnout includes over 96
per cent of the Freshman elass.

Although this represents a marked
drop from the record high number
of 900 that were sold last year at
this time, Croft went on to say that
a decrease in the turnout had pre-
viously been expected. This, he said,
was due to the $5.00 price rise of
the coming year’s Dance Plans,
bringing the present cost of each up
to $30.00.

This year’s higher price, explained
Croft, was an inevitable step in order
that W&L might keep up with the

rising cost of entertainment and re-|

tain the high quality of performer:
that it has had in past years. He

said that the Dance Board is look-|

ing forward to one of its very best
seasons and is, at the present time
seasons.

Croft added in closing that Dance
Plans are still on Sale in the Co-op
and will be until Openings Dances;
also, that, even with this
higher price, the purchase
the biggest

money saving

When persons who consider them-

gather together to discuss contem-
porary film directors, they normally
limit the field to Antonioni, Truffaut,
Bergman, Kurosawa, Fellini, and
several others whose names I won't
bother to spell. But never have I
heard the name of John Sturges
brought up in such a discussion.
Assuming that a.) the cinema is an
art medium and b.) that the imme-

In order to explicate a good di-

commonly used to credit one of the

‘Hero of the Ineffectual’

 

Salinger Sickens Critic

By JIM LEDBETTER

If one reads Time magazine,
one knows that J. D. Salinger
was the champion of the Ameri-
ean set until quite recently
when William Golding took his
place. Without doubting this
premise, it is easy to see why
Salinger has been ousted; his
last two collections of paired short
stories a la New Yorker remind
this reviewer of a fraternity
brother who was doing quite well
this weekend until he barfed.

There are two stories in the
volume in question. The title
story deserves little attention.
It can be read enjoyably if
one is in Salinger’s in-group
out-group, an organization that
might well borrow the name of
this group we see posters for
around the campus, the Society

seems to work from a_ formula,
which he stringently observes. Take
two or more popular stars, add an
easily recognizable and supporting
cast, get Elmer Bernstein to write
the music, have the author write
amusing and clever dialogue, put in
plenty of varied action, and most
important, use color. Amazing as it
may seem, it works. |
The Great Escape” |

Sturges has done these things in|
the “Great Escape.” His popular
stars are James Garner (much more
suited to this role than he was for
the parts he played in the “Chil-
dren’s hour,’ or the more recent
“Thrill of It All’), Steve McQueen,
and Richard Attenborough. The sup-
porting cast includes Charles Bron-
son, James Coburn, James Donald,
ete. The action is concerned with
the induction of over 250 allied es-
cape specialists, garnered from many
different German P.O.W. camps.
and their combined effort to pull off

 

Of all the films I saw this summer,
none was more enjoyable. It is brisk-
ly directed, competently acted, and
usually quite amusing. It is a cred-
itable example of a good Holly-
wood movie. I am able io guarantee
several hours of entertainment. (Un-
conditionally.)

“David and Lisa”

Beginning at the Lyric Sunday is
“David and Lisa” which one week-

ly publication called the best Amer-
ican film of of 1962, and which, of

of Individualists; a self-contra-
diction, needless to say, but a
fact that doesn’t seem to both-
er the members.

But the piece that occasions
this overflow of bitterness is one
that, unhappily, is meant to be
the cornerstone of Salinger’s
work: Seymour—an introduction.

Perhaps we should begin with
the Glass family. In his earliest
collection, which was very fine,
Salinger included a story called
“A Perfect Day for Banana Fish.”
The main character, Seymour
Glass, lays out on the beach
awhile, talks to a little kid, and
then goes up to his hotel room
and shoots himself in the head.
It was a good story.

Unhappily, this character
grew in Salinger’s mind to ma-
jor proportions. A whole family
grew up around Seymour, came
to life, and appeared in print—
and this is all we have heard
of Salinger since. No superla-
tive can be wasted on the Glass
family; they speak yea many
languages, take over a TV quiz
program, and think about
things so profound that Salinger
can’t even write them down.

I hate to psychoanalyze a writ-
er, but it seems that Salinger, who
is really the hero of the ineffect-
ual, has created the family he
would like to be, and the person
he would most like to be in that
family. And he has found that
it is quite simple to indicate that
Seymour can speak Sanskrit and
Japanese simply by putting it
down on paper; to say that Sey-
mour has written the century’s
greatest poems is the easiest thing
in the world. Unfortunately, in
the case of the poems, his widow
will not allow them to be pub-
lished for some reason; but we
just knew they are great. And
of course, the whole thing is there
are no poems; Salinger only
wishes there were.

In fact, Salinger does not suc-
ceed in becoming Seymour at all,
but rather his brother, Buddy,
who bears a striking resemblance
to Salinger himself: a hermit who
sits out in a shack in the woods
and writes; who has written a
book about a prep-school type
(The Catcher in the Rye) and
who has even written “A Perfect
Day for Banana Fish.” It is he
who is telling us all about the
greatness of Seymour, but un-
fortunately he gets so choked up
that he can’t even express him-
self clearly, though we know that
he should be able to since he is
a genius—who has read ten

Theatre in Color and Panavision.

By BERT PHILLIPS
Special Features Editor

Facing the sea there was a crooked line of naked men,
heads and shoulders drooped indifferently, faces unshaven.
No one spoke.

He was the third person in from the water-line, standing
by himself; but then, everyone else in the line was alone.
The sand which stuck to his legs made him think uncertainly
that he had been in the water before and then perhaps laid
down and slept, but he couldn’t remember. It didn’t bother
him though, and he was not particularly surprised to be
standing in the line with the others. He looked and could
recognize only one. This also caused him no concern.

The men were dirty, not with mud or clay, but instead
with soot, as if they had spent their entire lives in some
huge, deserted fireplace. No one ever turned around to
see what was behind, and they didn’t shiver or perspire,
for they were neither hot nor cold. There was silence, and
even in their minds there was no noise. Blank minds, neither
worrying, nor wondering.

In front of the line and off to the right stood the Bird-
man, speaking to them and at the same time rocking back
on his heels and then forward on his toes. His rhetoric was
dull... monotonous. This creature seemed to feel he was
above the situation and was weary of giving the same in-
structions over and over again. Perhaps he had been doing it
for many years, rocking from foot to foot, pausing to say
“uh” occasionally, and then proceeding with his head
rolling rhythmically from side to side, causing his eyes to
swing back and forth as if they were marbles dropped into
the bottom of a teacup.

The Birdman was about ten feet tall. His body was
blue-green, but his wings, which he held out to his side,
dangling as if they were the arms of a human, were gold
and maroon. His head was shaven and white and contrasted
sharply with the ever-moving black eyes and long, ebony
beak. Talking in his slow, dull voice, the Birdman said the
same thing to each of the naked men as they came to the

edge of the lapping waves.
Behind the creature the calm sea appeared to stretch

 

 
   
 
  

 

(Continued on page 4) (Continued on page 4)

forever and then at some unreal place to flow into the mist.
The sky was steely colored and no clouds were discernable,
only the grey mist which the sun could not hope to pene-
trate. The sun’s rays were diffused and lost like the small
beam of a flashlight which reaches out hopelessly for the
moon. The mist was everywhere and the sun was nowhere,
and the sea did not reflect light, but instead seemed to con-
sume it. There were no gulls or flies as there are at other
beaches.

He stood on the sand next to the massive, unconcerned
Birdman. Naked and completely alone, and now afraid of
the vast unknown which he faced. It was his turn now, and

the Birdman had moved on and was reciting to the stranger
who stood in line behind him.

How could he be afraid of something that he was com-
pletely ignorant of? But his neck and shoulders were taunt
as a hunted animal and he instinctively put his hand to his
mouth where his teeth sunk into the bleeding nails and the
dying flesh.

There was no breeze, no salt in the air. He wondered
why there was no salt in the air. Maybe there was none in
the water; perhaps this was not the sea. The sea is supposed
to be blue and this water was very green. His mind skipped
from thought to thought and memory to memory. And he
was so completely uncertain about what the Birdman had
said. How could he know what was the signal for him to
dive? And the sea was so very green. Everywhere was a
ghastly, lurking, lapping greeness with white foam and

ganization is affiliated with ISI.
That’s the International Society for
Individualists. It does seem rather
curious, and a sign of the times, that
now even “individualists” organize.
Friday
Sept. 27, 1963
Today I saw a freshman, bedecked
in beanie, carefully walk out of his
way in order to stay on the side-
walks and off the grass; then I saw
a sockless, coatless upperclassman
ignore the freshman’s greeting.

 

All the efforts of the Assimilation
Committee, it seems, are wasted
when one upperclassman show flag-
rant disregard for the Traditions be-
fore a freshman.

Those who left the football game
early today made a mistake. Granted
the first three quarters were real-
ly rather dull, but the last quarter—
the last five minutes, actually—made
up for it.

It was encouraging to notice, how-
ever, that more people than usual
stayed for a good portion of the
game.

Sunday
Sept. 29, 1963

Attendance at the Commons
breakfast this morning was sparse,
with a few stragglers groping for
tomato juice.

The freshmen are evidently be-
coming assimilated into the tradi-
tion of W&L weekends at record
speed.

black lines where white foam met green liquid. And why
wasn’t there any salt? He couldn’t understand why he had
to dive. The Birdman had not told him, but perhaps it
was because everyone else has to dive also. But why did
everyone else have to dive? It was all so puzzling. . .

Now he was so alone. Nobody was around him. No peo-
ple, no air, no sun; only the grey mist and the green liquid.
Not even the Birdman any more.

Almost falling instead of flying, the black form swooped
down. The Messenger was black and large, and he under-
stood that this was the signal.

He never hesitated, even though the Birdman said the
fish would destroy him, and he dreaded the grey sharks.
They would come from behind, slowly catching him and
teasing always. Menacing and grey in the eternal greenness.
But he never once wavered.

The sea was neither warm nor cold, but instead, the
temperature of his blood. It deepened very quickly, and
he dived, realizing that he could never come back to the
surface. And the Birdman had been so unconcerned about
it all, and his instructions seemed so senseless, and if not
senseless, then instead so very useless. For what if he did find
It in the greenness’ How cold he save It from the depths if
the Birdman had told him he could never return?

He wondered if anyone else who had been in the line
was now floundering in the green sea. Now he thought
about the men in the crooked line who had touched their
bodies to his. They had all been naked and stood together,
but they were so alone even when their pale bodies had met.
They had never talked.

He turned in the water as the Birdman had told him and
swam, pulling and kicking, and looking constantly for the
Thing he had been sent to find but which he had never
seen. He knew if he saw It, he would understand what to
do. But how could he save it from the everlasting greenness?

In the end the sharks did not destroy him. The fish
that finally caught him from behind were blue ones which
latched themselves onto his white body and covered it until
the pale skin was no longer discernable, and only a blue
form was left writhing in the profound greenness.

McLaughlin’s Charges Gain 28-0

Verdict Over ’ Jackets; Yoffe Star

By JIM CROTHERS
Assistant Sports Editor

After a defensive first-half, Washington and Lee opened up and scored |,
22 points in the third and fourth quarters Saturday while overcoming |

Randolph-Macon, 28-0, on the victor’s Wilson Field.
Led by All CAC halfback Stuart Yoffe and junior,

Macon’s scant 128 yards. Yoffe scored twice on runs of 13 and 6 yards for
Washington and Lee’s first two tal-*

 

Bill David, the|'
Generals amassed a total of 254 offensive yards as compared to Randolph- ||

 

 

lies while carrying the pigskin 16)
times and picking up a total of 83
yards.

David celebrated his twenty-first
birthday by snagging two passes for
36 yards—one a 27-yard scoring
play from A. J. Barranco for W&L’s
final touechdown—and averaging 41
yards per runback on three Yellow
Jacket punts. The speedy halfback
also starred on defense by recov-
ering a Randolph-Macon fumble and
by making a fantastic leaping inter-
ception.

The other General scores came on
a five-yard fullback plunge by
Syd Butler and a couple of two
point extra-point conversions. Hen-
ry Sackett, who carried the football
64 yards in 10 attempts in one of
the afternoon’s standout perform-
ances, scored the first two-pointer
in the fourth quarter while a Bar-
ranco-to-Mike Jenkins pass ac-
counted for the final two points.

Coach McLaughlin said he was
generally favorably impressed and
that he felt the W&L mistakes came
from over-anxiety than from mental
lapses. The coach also expressed his
satisfaction at the way the General
offense adjusted to the new Yellow
Jacket defenses.

Frosh Football Team)
Loses To Woodberry)

In Initial Game, 28-O

By DAVE SHUFFLEBARGER
Tuesday Sports Editor
“We're not disappointed after an
opener like that,’ Coach Dana Swan
said after his
dropped a 28-0 decision to Wood-

berry Forest .

Despite the score, Coach Swan
and his aides are pleased with the
promising showing of almost all of
the team. In their initial contest
on Saturday, the Baby Generals
faced a Woodberry team that had
one game under its belt already.
Playing at home, Woodberry scored
once in each quarter, successfully
kicking the extra point each time.

One of the high spots for the W&L
frosh was the fine timing shown by
the offensive backfield. Swan said
that exceptional performances were
turned in by guard Bryant Ken-
drick, Logan Bullet, and Warren
Stuart .

Last week the team elected Roger
Milam, Kendrick, and Ben Gambill
as their tri-captains.

Friday the frosh take on Staunton,
a team that downed E. C. Glass last
week. Staunton’s problem, similar
to the Baby Generals’, is a lack of
speed. The military boys have gone
to bigger and stronger backs in
place of the scatbacks of the past.
This, coupled with an always potent
line, could make Staunton a hard
nut to crack.

A lot of the frosh football trouble
was first-game jitters. In viewing
the films, I found that most of
Woodberry’s success was due to
W&L mistakes. It’s hard for any
football player to completely switch
system, as most of the frosh have
done, with the W&L go-T and 5-4

defense.

~ Our Athletic Policy

Washington and Lee’s non-subsi-
dized athletic program has been in
effect since June, 1954 when the
University’s Board of Trustees de-
emphasized athletics. The trustees
in their 1954 decision said that no
more athletic grants-in-aid or
“scholarships” would be extended,
and that all athletic activities, in-
cluding intercollegiate sports, intra-
murals and physical education, would
be incorporated under one depart-| to
ment and one director. There is
no so-called “major” and “minor”
sports distinction at W&L.

The eight-year-old policy is based
on these considerations:

Intercollegiate athletics have a
proper place in the general program
of a college or university such as
Washington and Lee. This role, how-
ever, should not be compromised in
such a | way tht the best interests of

the University become secondary to
the interests of outside influences.

While college sports might be of

great interest to the general public,
the creation of public spectacles
should not be a goal of the Univer-
sity’s intercollegiate athletic pro-
gram. The value derived from a
sports program by the students is the
only real measure of success for
intercollegiate athletics at Washing-
ton and Lee.

SHUFFLIN’ ALONG

By DAVE SHUFFLEBARGER

With only Bob Lathrop’s frosh soccer team untested,
W&L’s Fall inter-collegiate sports program appears to be well
on its way towards at least a repitition of last year’s outstanding
ledger.

In 1962, the booters wound up third in the state,
W&L football fans crowed over an 8-1 mark, and pipe-smok-
ing mentor Dick Miller “harried” his cross-country charges to
a 7-2 record. Both the freshman soccer and football teams,
although not posting earth-shaking ledgers, did fine jobs of
training as witnessed by the large number of sophomores who
have been in the spotlight this year.

 

The baby booters open a tough seven-game slate at Lynch-
burg Thursday and Lathrop, a former star himself, will field
a group of frosh that could earn a 4-3 record after it’s all over.

Even though the three varsity teams all won their openers,

| Cross Country Squad

Notches 18-45 Victory

| Over Roanoke College

By LARRY CRAIG
Tuesday Sports Writer

Andy Kilpatrick and Riff O’Con-
nor left all competitors in their dust
Saturday afternoon as they placed
one-two respectively in the cross-
country meet with Roanoke Col-
lege. The W&L team smashed Roa-
noke by the score of 18-45.

Kilpatrick and O’Connor, well
out in front at the finish, tried to

finish in a dead heat, but the
judges awarded first to W&lL’s
captain.

Coach Dick Miller was very

pleased with the entire team’s effort,
pointing out that Roanoke placed
only one runner in the top eight
finishers. The times, coach Miller
said, were pjleasantly surprising
for this early in the season; and he
believes better times are within
reach of Kilpatrick and O’Connor as
both took the last quarter in an un-
hurried jog. The coach also empha-
sized the excellent over-all balance
of this year’s team; and in this
balance, he places his hopes for a
good record.

The runners duel a strong Lynch-
burg team this Friday and another
tea meffort equal or better than
Saturday’s will be necessary in or-
der for the boys to emerge vic-
torious.

Last season Roanoke won the first
two places, but the Generals copped
the next 11 for a hard earned vic-
tory. The Generals showed a season’s
mark of seven wins, two losses in

 

going. Just before the end of the half
Preben Berthelsen broke loose from
the defense to score the winners’
first goal.

The Generals came out to start
the second half with great deter-
mination, which paid off. Bruce
Jackson scored midway in the third
period with a beautiful shot from
about 90 feet to tie the score. With
about 40 seconds remaining in the
period Chris Clarke slammed in the
winning goal.

The fourth quarter was a defensive
battle as neither team was able to
score. Tom Green, the Generals’
outstanding goalie, came through
in fine fashion to protect the slim
lead with several saves in that per-
iod.

Jackson played an outstanding
game for the winners, as he was all
over the field. Tim Henry was credit-
ed with two assists to aid the cause.
Actually, anyone of the team could
be singled out for his fine play as
it was a great team effort.

The only dark note of the game
for W&L .was tht freshman Fred
Skinner, the only freshman who ac-
companied the team on the trip,
twisted his ankle after playing only
a few minutes. The severity of the
injury has not been determined yet,
but Skinner is on crutches.

The Generals next game will be
at W&L Friday at 3:15 against Ran-
dolph-Macon. If the Generals get
another good team effort, they
should be able to handle the visitors
from Ashland, Virginia.

thousand pages a day from the
age of five, or some such non-
sense.

Until this story Salinger had
established his position as the
finest first-person narrator since
Hemingway. Yet writing in the
first person opens way for many
dangers. The ingratiating manner
of a Holden Caulfield can easily
turn into the sort of sickening in-
nuendo that the New Yorker
loves so. In this story Salinger
falls into each danger and it is
almost unreadable. In fact it is,
unless you have to write a re-
vie wof it; trust me.

Philliaps will write a critical re-
view of Salinger’s book, taking the
opposite point of view from Led-
better’s.)

movie, however, is sometimes overly
sentimental, often lacking in imag-
nation, and too much of a surface
romance. Though the direction is
effective and the photography ex-
cellent, it is not a great film. It is
simply a good one.

|Dana Swan is not the least discouraged over his freshman
| football loss to Woodberry Forest. “We have to teach every
‘boy a new system, and I think they’re learning it faster than
can be expected,” Swan said.

This may sound funny, but the truth of the matter s that
Swan’s team was allowed six fewer practices this year than
ever before due to a very busy Fall schedule.

If Coach Lyle’s front line and a few plucky reserves hold
out, the varsity soccer team should end up with a fairly good
season, but ngt quite as good as last year’s. It took some fine
pressure play for the Generals to pull out a 3-2 win over Pfeif-
er.

After a slow start the gridiron worriors romped to victory
over the Jackets, but a couple of injuries marred the triumph.
Right tackle, Jim Slyvester has sustained a broken blood ves-
sel in his foot and may be out for the Oberlin game. Ace
halfback Stu Yoffe could ride the bench just for safety’s sake
due to a pulled muscle in his lower right leg, the same one that
bothered him last year.
