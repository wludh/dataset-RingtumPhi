Grandison Singers To Appear At Fancy Dress Ball

 

Leadership Qualities:
Topic Of Gaines’ Talk

“Credentials for Leader-
ship” will be the topic of Dr.
Francis Pendleton Gaines’

speech at the 49th Annual
ODK Tap Day Assembly. Don

Partington, president of Wash-
ington and Lee’s ODK chapter, has
announced that the assembly will be
held on December 17 at 12 o’clock
noon in Doremus Gymnasium. A
banquet for both old and newly-
tapped members will be held in
Evans Hall following the address by
the Chancellor of the University.

Dr. Gaines, noted as one of the
South’s greatest orators, received his
AB. degree from the University of
Richmond, his A.M. from the Uni-
versity of Chicago, his Ph.D. from
Columbia, and his Litt.D. from Duke
and Columbia. In 1930 he accepted
the presidency of Washington and
Lee and held that office until 1959.
Upon his retirement he was made
Chancellor of the University. In ad-
dition, he has received honorary
degrees from the following schools:
Baylor, Furman, Mercer, Richmond,
Wake Forest, William Jewell, Se-
wanee, University of Chattanooga,
University of North Carolina,
Waynesburg College, Hampden-Syd-
ney, Rollins, and Washington and
Lee.

An ODK member himself, Dr.
Gaines has served as president of
the Woodrow Wilson Birthplace
Foundation, director of the George
C. Marshall Foundation, and presi-
dent of the Cooperative Education
Association of Virginia. He is also
the author of three books, The
Southern Plantation, Lee—The Final
Achievement and Southern Oratory.

Forty-Ninth Assembly

The assembly will be the forty-

ninth in which ODK taps new mem-

bers from the student body, the
faculty, and the alumni. New mem-
bers are selected by old members

on the basis of leadership and cit-
izenship in various aspects of uni-
versity life, and all student members
must be in the upper 35 per cent
of their class in scholastic standing.

‘CoP Speaker
Sponsored Here
By Convention

The chairman of the Draft Gold-
water drive in the South will speak
at Washington and Lee Monday
night under the sponsorship of the
Mock Republican Convention.

John E. Grenier, a Birmingham
attorney who is chairman of the
Alabama Republican Party as well
as being one of the top men in the
Goldwater drive, will appear in du-
Pont Auditorium at 8:00 p.m. He will
talk on the Republican Party in
the South and on the role of young
professional men such as himself in
reviving the southern GOP.

Grenier has earned a reputation
as one of the most effective of the

talk is the first of a
series of events planned by the Mock

Convention Steering Committee to

prepare the student body for effec-
tive participation in the spring con-

the most important members of the
committee to draft Senator Gold-
water ,his talk will be non-partisan
as concerns the candidacy.

Announce Appointments

Eight students have been ap-
pointed to administration jobs in the
Mock Convention. Jim Rowe, assist-
ant chairman of the convention and
director of finances, named Don
Huffman and John Huss as co-
chairmen of the finance committee.
Huss, who is charged with national
fund-raising for the convention, is
also Treasurer for the convention.
Huffman is responsible for fund-

Examination Schedule

January 21, 1964 through January 30, 1964
It is the responsibility of each student to know the time and place of

meeting of each of his examinations.

The hours for examinations are 9:00-

12:00 and 2:00-5:00. Any student more than five minutes late must present
a satisfactory reason for his lateness to be allowed to take the examina-

tion.

The omission by a student of any regular examination causes him to for-
feit his place in the class and to receive grade F for the semester, unless he
is excused for reasons deemd sufficient by the Dean and instructor con-

ball will be a combination dance and
concert.”

The dance will begin at nine p.m.

Croft stated that the gospel-singers
will perform around 11 o’clock.
“While adding color to the theme of
the ball,” Croft remarked, “the
scheduling of both the band and
the gospel-singers should provide an
appealing variety in the entertain-
ment.”

Stan Rubin’s Dixieland section, the
“Tiger Town Five,” will back the
gospel-singers. In _ addition, the
gospel-singers (apparelled in robes)
customarily use tambourines and
drums.

Sweet Chariot Singers have also
been instrumental in popularizing
gospel-singing. Originating in Phila-
delphia in 1961 the group has per-
formed in nightclubs throughout the
eastern seaboard.

In commenting on this new musi-
cal trend, Croft stated that “since
folk-singing is starting on the de-
cline, gospel-singing has begun to
emerge as a sign of a new taste in
popular music. According to critics,
this type of music will continue gain-
ing a wide and popular appeal in the
near future.”

In defining popular gospel-singing,

 

Time stated: “It’s a little bit of rhy-
thm and blues, a little bit of soul
jazz, and a lot of oldtime religion.”

Favorably reviewed in magazines
such as Down Beat and Playboy,
gospel music is commonly played
in the Newport Jazz Festivals and
the Hootenanny shows. It combines
somewhat jazz and rock and roll, and
among the former gospel-singers are
celebrities such as James Brown,
Ray Charles, and The Shirelles.

The concert was instituted after
the success of the midnight concert
at last year’s Ball by Stan Ruben’s
Tigertown Five.

William Humphrey, Washington
and Lee’s writer-in-residence, spoke
in Lee Chapel Wednesday night on
| “Flaubert and Tolstoy: Carthage and
Moscow.”

Humphrey, who is the Glasgow
| Visiting Professor for the Fall term,
| begon his talk with a general con-
| demination of what he termed “hy-
phenated novels,” that is, works such
as historical novels and_ political
novels. These, he claimed, are detri-
mental to history as well as to fic-
tion, because of an idealization of
characters and events of the past
which not only causes an unobjective
view of history, but often tends to
overshadow the literary value of the
work.
“Looking Backward”

Humphrey stated that good writers
such as Hemingway, Melville, Balzac,
and Conrad, as well as bad writers,
have been guilty of “looking back-
ward” into history to find character-
istics which they believed lacking
in their own times.

The talk centered on two histori-
cal novels, Flaubert’s Salammbo and
Tolstoy’s War and Peace. The for-

 

mer is a typically unsuccessful his-

 

Is the Assimilation Committee
necessary for the preservation of
conventional dress? Is it carrying
out its function effectively?

The newly formed Student Lead-
ership Forum included these points
in its discussion of the problems of
conventional dress and the role of
the Assimilation Committee. The
Forum chose this topic for debate as
the result of a letter appearing in
the Ring-tum Phi advocating the
abolishment of the Assimilation
Committee.

Held in conjunction with a sup-
per, the discussion took place in the
Letitia Pate Evans Dining Hall in
the first meeting of the Forum since
its formation on October 9.

Senior Jud Reis,
Leadership Forum, moderated the
meeting. Reis announced that the
voting on the recently written pro-
posed constitution for the Forum
would be postponed.

The discussion was initiated by
two brief speeches giving opposing
viewpoints on the Assimilation Com-
mittee. Jim Maffitt, Assimilation

Historical Novels Panned
For Idealizing Past Glory

torical novel, and the
uniquely successful one.
The reason for Flaubert’s failure,
Humphrey pointed out, was his mo-
tive for returning to the past. The
French novelist was in search of a
time when people had an energy and
passion which Flaubert believed his
contemporaries to lack. On his por-
trayal of ancient Carthage, which is
the setting for Salammbo, Flaubert
made the unfortunate error of letting
his own decor swamp the drama of
the novel. The result was a book of
idealized and unreal characters.

Sought Universal Truth

Tolstoy, in contrast to Flaubert,
turned to history to find universal
truth. War and Peace was written
with the idea that the greater the
man in history, the further he is
removed from it. The description of
French soldiers in the chaos in the
batlefield, without the guidance of
generals, is analogous to Tolstoy’s
idea that history moves impervious
to great men. This historical argu-
ment, Humphrey stated, released the
creativity in the novel.

Heroics, which are a great fault
of most historical novels, are not
present in War and Peace, since
Tolstoy despised glory and denied it
to the past. The conclusion of the
novel, which sets it apart from
other historical novels, is that men
are essentially the same now as they
have been in the past.

more evening lecture in Lee Chapel
on Thursday, January 9, will read
his own work Monday afternoon in

Clearing Up Some Misgivings

The debate over the Assimilation Committee at the Univer-
sity Leadership Conference last Tuesday is indicative of the
rising concern over W&L’s conventional dress. We, therefore,
feel this to be an opportune time to clear up some of the mis-

givings that a number of students might have toward this issue.
We hope that the following may shed some light.

IS CONVENTIONAL DRESS A RULE OR A

TRADITION?

Students argue that if conventional dress is a rule, it should
be explicitly defined and the specific provisions be made public
to the student body. If, on the other hand, it is a tradition,
it should not be externally imposed in any manner; adherence
to it should be spontaneous and voluntary.

We feel, however, that the issue should not be presented
in such black and white terms, that conventional dress is some-

where between a “rule” and a ‘

‘tradition.” Just to give it some

category, we shall state that conventional dress is a mutually-
agreed-upon practice, the perpetuation of which is insured
through a mutually-agreed-upon means of enforcement.

HOW IS CONVENTIONAL DRESS ENFORCED?

By the students themselves. They alone have the power of
enforcement; contrary to popular belief, the Assimilation
Committee is simply a medium by which this power can oper-
ate. For it is the individual student who brings up the charge
against a presumed violator; the Assimilation Committee acts
only as the intermediary body between the accused and the
accuser to see that the charge is valid and is equitably handled.

SHOULDN’T WE DEFINE CONVENTIONAL DRESS?

To define conventional dress with its innumerable excep-
tions would be virtually impossible, and would at the same time
destroy the spirit under which the practice has traditionally
been fostered. However, we do need some qualifications to
the statement that ‘“‘conventional dress is required at all times
on University property and within the town of Lexington.”
We should certainly qualify “at all times.”

WHEN SHOULD WE PERMIT EXCEPTIONS?

To answer this question, we must first examine the pur-
pose of conventional dress. The principle behind it is that
good appearance is one of the ways a student can help promote
a favorable reflection of his University. It is assumed for this
reason that conventional dress will be observed at all times,
except when it is inappropriate to do so. For example, a stu-
dent is not expected to wear a coat and tie on his way to the gym
for a workout. The same is true for students driving out of
town to Goshen, etc. This matter of appropriateness is left
up to the sincere judgment of the student.

IS CONVENTIONAL DRESS WORTH KEEPING?

As it was brought out at the Leadership Conference, con-
ventional dress has been a basic part of the W&L personality.
Even more significant, it is a part of our personality which has
been widely praised, and in turn provides an added source of
pride in our University. This observation is confirmed con-
stantly by the compliments and recognition we receive from
visitors and students’ parents. In this and many other ways,
the continuance of conventional dress has been justified over
and over again, and any way that we can insure its preservation
merits our full consideration and endorsement.

 

 

| Letters To The Editor...

 

 

Mr. Lamar Lamb
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Sir:

A few random notes and observa-
tions on your sloppy “attempt to
show the liberal point of view on
the currently debated Civil Rights
Bill.”

It is interesting to note in passing
that you use “there is no doubt” or
some variant assertion several times
in your article. Less of this ex
cathedra dagmatism and more calm
logic would have served you better.

(1) You say “if one (presumably
meaning one of us “bigoted property
owners” who oppose the bill?) “reads
further in the Constitution,” he will
“discover” the equal protection
clause. If you read further, you
would “discover” the equal protec-
tion clause applies to existing laws,
not as a justification for further
legislation.

(2) Your suggestion “those who
make the ‘voting rights’ criticism”
of the bill might also oppose woman
suffrage is rather cute. I might point
out that this amendment was en-
acted through the constitutionally
provided process; the states thus ob-
viously acquiesced in ceding that
area of voting rights—but as yet, no
other—to the federal government.

(3) You assert the federal gov-
ernment has had to move in to pro-
tect individual rights. Not so. Ad-
mittedly, where existing and ade-
quate state voting laws are dis-
criminatorily enforced, those dis-

 

criminated against have legitimate
recourse to federal courts. This,
however, is a separate matter from
new federal legislation.

(4) You say “one must look to just
what the Supreme Court would (my
emphasis) decide....” This test of
constitutionality is, as far as I know,
unique Anglo-American jurispru-
dence. A few—nay, most—in fact,
all—constitutional law authorities
would say you look instead to what
the Court has decided. In a word, our
system is one of precedent, not pre-
diction.

(5) You say opponents of the bill
are “defending racial discrimination
whether they want to admit it or
not.” Not so. I oppose the bill, and
I strenuously condemn, personally,
racial discrimination. Just as strenu-
ously, however, I defend the right
of every citizen, of whatever color,
to be free from laws saying he can-
not, in his private life, discriminate.

(6) You accuse conservatives of
concerning themselves only with the
liberty of “bigoted property own-
ers.” I’m not sure what you have
against the concept of private prop-
erty, engrained in our legal system
through 800 years of development.
But I must admonish you to reflect
how much “human rights” (the fav-
orite fetish of the left) would be
worth without the right to own and
control private property.

Solid South For Goldwater Concept Gone;
All Bets Are Off For Confused Republicans

By STEVE SMITH

Last year at this time Nelson

Barry Goldwater was running away

body is exactly sure of his position,
but what is certain is that the Re-

from an apparent Goldwater land-
slide into a free-for-all.

The accession of President Johnson
is tearing into the Goldwater cam-
paign just as events essentially re-
moved from politics, divorce and re-
marriage, earlier tore into the Rocke-

are momentarily bewildered, and

Montgomery Questions W&L Democracy;
Advocates Formation Of Student Senate

(The following does not neces-
sarily represent the editorial posi-
tion of this paper. Editor)

By WARREN MONTGOMERY
Associate Editor

What do you think about such im-
portant student matters as conven-
tional dress, school
supported dances,
the honor system,
» cuts, and_ school
control over fra-
ternities? Actual-
ly it does not mat-
ter what you think
| about these issues,
or any others. De-
fm cisions on all

" student affairs are
made by a mere
ney handful of people.

Do you think that our student
government operates on a system of
democracy? If so, you are wrong...
unless you think “democracy” is be-
ing told once a year by your fra-
ternity or group to vote for a series
of candidates who will have abso-
lute control over you for the next
year.

 

Minority Rule

Are you content to remain impas-
sive to whatever decisions are made
for you or to continue to be im-
potent, irrelevant, and useless in the
government of the body of which
you are an equal member? Are you
satisfied to let the ruling junta keep
secret from you the proceedings
which affect you the most and to
allow it the power of censorship
over the student press? If you are
not, then part of the Tuesday edi-
tion’s revealing and forthright edi-
torial might interest you. “...we
have reason to believe that a small
minority of that small minority
called the EC is running our stu-
dent government. We would like to
see a Student Senate with a veto
power over the EC...”

A student senate is not a revo-
lutionary, new, or untried idea. On
a great many American campuses,
it is the established form of student
government. Most student bodies
will not put up with an elective oli-
garchy, which is an apt description
of the Executive Committee.

Benefits of Student Senate

What would be the benefits of a
W&L Student Senate? Obviously,
and most important, it would let
each individual member of the stu-
dent body have some influence in his
school government. the W&L stu-
dent is an intelligent and thoughtful
person, certainly capable of taking
part in the direction of his own af-
fairs. Why then should the student
government be dictated by a cabal
of people no more capable than he?

Next, a student senate would do
much to clean up our eynical and
corrupt campus politics. As it is now,
a party can gain influence only if

 

its fraternities present a solid front—
which means that the individual
member is faced with voting party
despite his own feelings or betraying
his fraternity. With a student legis-
lature, however, the entire political
scene would no longer be a matter
of the election of party candidates—
each fraternity would have an equal
influence on student questions and
would not have to grasp and claw
for power through election of frater-
nity brothers.

Eliminate Inaction

A student congress would elimi-
nate the inaction and procrastination
so often exhibited by the EC. In a
student congress, any representa-
tive could bring an issue up for a
decision at any time, and a definite
ruling would be made then and
there.

Finally, a student senate would
help nullify much of the bitterness
felt by many students toward what
they consider, rightfully, an archaic,
reactionary, and oppressive school
government. A student who is fairly
represented has no grounds for com-
plaint on how the school is run.

Why Not?

Why shouldn’t we have a senate?
“Well, for one thing,” the typical
complacent, apathetic, steady-as-
you-goer might say, “we have de-
mocracy here because we get to
choose our leaders according to their
beliefs.” Not at all. We have a choice
between two tickets which are cho-
sen by political manipulation within
small inter-fraternity cliques. The
student has no say on who is to run.
Furthermore, the two candidates,
can and usually do evade any real
problems and issues that might stir
up controversy. Our elections are
usually Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-
Dee affairs, full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing. Also, once in, a
candidate does not have to do any-
thing, for he is utterly out of the
reach of the student body.

“But a student congress would be
a very complex thing to create and
operate,” says the indifferent stu-
dent. Wrong again. It could simply
be a monthly meeting of elected rep-
resentatives from each fraternity,
the Independent Union, and each
class. We could even turn the IFC
into a student senate, with slight
modification. All a senate would need
is power to initiate legislation, and
the right to approve all EC propo-
sals. Give these powers to the IFC,
and we have a student senate.

Methods of Reform

“Well,” admits the now thoroughly
convinced student, “a student senate
would be a great thing, but the EC
has complete authority over every-
thing. They don’t have to listen to

student demands unless they want
to, and they obviously don’t. What
can I do all by myself?”

In the first place, you can write

 

 

*

letters to the paper. The Ring-tum
Phi welcomes and prints almost all
the letters sent to it. Even EC
members must read the paper.

If the EC fails to see any signifi-
cance in letters, stronger measures
can be taken. Petitioning for a stu-
dent congress would surely give the
EC some inkling of what is going on.

And finally, if despite student
pressure, the EC still refuses to
budge from its authoritarian clutch
on the campus, students could cram
reform right down its throat. Any
organization, especially the IFC, could
draw up a new constitution and pre-
sent it to the student body for a
vote. Upon passage, such a constitu-
tion would be legally operative. The
EC derives its powers from the stu-

(Continued on page 4)

 

convention votes, now they may be
left holding the bag. The concept
of a solid South for Goldwater at
the Convention and in the electoral
college must be completely junked.
This is not to say that the Arizona
Senator is not still a strong candi-
date, but that his candidacy must
find a new base if it is to continue. It
is by no means certain that Gold-
water will even declare his candi-
dacy,, since the plan of defeating
Kennedy can’t work against Johnson.
Until the assassination it seemed that
1964 offered the perfect opportunity
for the conservatives to make a
showing; and Goldwater was the ob-
vious choice to contrast with the
New Frontier. Now that this contrast
has been somewhat blurred, will
Goldwater commit the conservatives
to the contest?

Against His Will

With a southerner in the White
House, the Goldwater South has col-
lapsed; with Kennedy gone, the
chance for the conservatives to win
a clear victory over the liberals is
gone. For Goldwater anything but a
decisive election victory over a
liberal champion, must be unsatis-
factory; and a contest between him-
self and Johnson doesn’t fill the bill
right now. Will Goldwater enter the
race under these changed circum-
stances? The answer is that he may
not like it, but that he may be forced
into it. The Draft Goldwater move-
ment has reached the point where
it is difficult for its supporters to
back out gracefully. If Goldwater re-
fuses to run he will not only disap-
point many people but he will an-
tagonize many others.

One reason Goldwater backers
couldn’t swallow a_ conservative
withdrawal, even a tactical one, is
that so many of them, are not
party professionals, but amateurs
who are in the game for the sole
purpose of electing the Arizona
senator. While this fact could
drag Goldwater into an unwilling
race, it has a happier aspect for
him if he makes a go of it. It en-
sures that he will retain his sup-
port even if the party strategists
decide that he can’t win. Gold-
water actually has grass roots
backing which won’t quit.

Amid all this speculation, Gold-
water has taken refuge for 15 days
in the Air Force Reserves for his
annual tour of service. He has stated
that he believes his support has re-
mained steady despite the change
in the White House, and commented
very favorably on President John-
son. His high estimation of Johnson
is indicative of Goldwater’s reluc-
tance to tangle with a man whom the

Call For ‘Pioneer Spirit’

By BOB POTTS

Friday Columnist
Speaking on the Tennessee Valley
Authority, Franklin Roosevelt once
said, “Many hard
lessons have
taught us the hu-
man waste that
results from lack
Of planning...
our nation has just
grown. It is time

to extend our
planning to a wid-
er field.” John

Kennedy had this
same sense of im-
mediate purpose
and Washington reflected an aura of
urgency in revitalizing American
politics and American life.

Kennedy’s dynamism was manifest
to a certain degree in the bills that
Congress passed during the 1961-1962
session including the area redevel-
opment act, public works accelera-
tion, increase of the minimum wage,
manpower training to give new
skills to the unemployed, expansion
of social security benefits, extension
of Civil Rights Commission, revision
of public welfare programs, housing
programs, two farm bills, drug con-
trol, and expanded college student
loan program.

Thermadorian Reaction

Yet the second American Revolu-
tion which began with the New Deal
and which was being carried on by
the New Frontier, is having its Ther-
madorian reaction as expressed by
conservative Southern Democrats
and Goldwater Republicans. The
clear-cut needs of Roosevelt’s time
are perhaps not as clear, not as
striking. Thus many no longer feel
the necessity for a public-spirited
drive along the lines of economic

 

programing and _ social legislation.
Ask a conservative what he would
do with the problems in West Vir-
ginia. If he doesn’t say, “Sell it to
the Russians”; he’ll declare that a
group should go off in a corner to
study the situation.

Fortunately, such men as John
Kennedy, or labor leaders, or many
college professors recognize that we
are still working on the frontier to
the solution of complex social and
economic problems, and that it is a
frontier which we must approach
with a pioneer spirit; not with a
“Nobody gets something for nothing
in this world, Pal” attitude.

Actually, we have only to look
around us to see erying need for
action. The mental hospital at Staun-
ton is not very far removed from
the snake-pit hospitals that Charles
Dickens described on visiting the
U.S. in the 1800’s. The whole area
which relies mainly on one industry
and the unemployed who stand in
line behind the bus depot for their
dole of “commodity rations” is re-
flected in similar communities across
the country.

Need in Unemployment

And on a national scale, the un-
employment is hovering around 5.5
per cent of the total working popu-
lation and acording to Columbia
University’s Bureau of Applied So-
cial Research, “the rate of unem-
ployment will double by 1970 if the
imbalances of the fifties persist.”
Some of these imbalances are the
result of automation, a relatively re-
cent force that does not always op-
erate for the general welfare. The
rising national productivity, high
profit margins and lack of increased
consumer demand has led in many
cases to stagnation and unemploy-

Generals Win Two; Play Centre Saturday
Four Grid-Men Named to All-CAC Squad

B-Ballers Down Lynchburg, '58-54)

Edge Bridgewater 66-62 in Upset

By LES G

RANDIS

Tomorrow night the Generals risk their 2-1 record against
Centre College, one of the tallest teams in the College Athletic

Conference.

This past week has been one of close contests for the Gen-
erals. On Tuesday they edged Bridgewater 66-62, and yester-

day narrowly beat Lynchburg 58-54.*
In yesterday’s game, Washington
and Lee got off to a slow start and
at one time in the first half were
down 24-7. But they came alive to
close the gap to 34-27 at halftime.

Lynchburg just barely outshot
the Generals from the floor, hitting
13 of 29 to W&L’s 12 of 28.

The second half saw the Gener-
als pick up where they left off, con-
tinuing to close the gap. With
Lynchburg ahead 44-41 and 10 min-
utes on the clock, forward Dick
Livingston tossed in three straight
field goals to put Washington and
Lee ahead for the first time, 47-45.

Lynchburg tied it up, but for-
ward Steve Sweitzer dropped in five
straight points to put the Generals
ahead 52-47.

W&L scored again but with four
minutes left Lynchburg captain
Jimmy Jones put in two free throws
to tie it up.

For three minutes W&L tried to
set up one last shot, but Livings-
ton was fouled. With 0:53 remaining
he put in two free throws to put
W&L ahead for the last time.

Lynchburg got the ball, but quick-
ly lost it. In the remaining seconds
gaurds Lou Paterno and Don Wallis
were fouled, each making one free
throw to clinch the victory.

Paterno led the Generals in scor-
ing with 16 points, and in rebounds
with nine. Fred Mindel was next
with nine points, followed by Liv-
ingston with eight, and captain Tom
Supak and Sweitzer with seven.
Center Bob Spessard was second in
rebounds with eight.

In the second half the Generals
made 12 of 31 from the floor for an
overall percentage of 40.72.

Leading scorer for Lynchburg
was Jones with 14, followed by Clark
and Dave Layman with seven. Lay-
man was also Lynchburg’s leading
rebounder with ten.

Although the score was just as
close, W&L’s game against Bridge-
water Tuesday night did not have
the same excitement of a come-
from-behind win.

Throughout most of the game the
Generals were on top, getting off to
a quick start and a 37-32 halftime
lead. Bridgewater had just defeated

W&L Swimmers
Lose To UVa.

By TIM O'KEEFE

Although the W&L swimming
team lost 62-33 Wednesday to the
University of Virginia, coach Norris
Eastman said the Generals perform-
ed better than the score indicates.

“We did our best time ever in
the 400-yard medley relay, but Vir-
ginia won it anyway,” Eastman said.

UVa. won 10 of the 11 events, giv-
ing W&L its first defeat against one
victory.

The Generals will have a chance
to move ahead again tomorrow when
they go against Loyola College here
at 2:30 p.m.

“Our boys swam well, but the
Cavaliers just had too good a team
for us,’ Eastman said.

Eastman said Bill Broaddus prob-
ably gave the best performance of
the team in the 200-yard back-
stroke, but he came in second.

“We have a young team this year,
and it may very well turn out to be
one of the best we have had as far
as time goes. Unfortunately, the
score doesn’t always show this,”
Eastman said.

W&L took its only event in the
400-yard freestyle relay with a time
of 3:47.8. Steve Lester, Hal Chase,
Walt McManus and Bart Taylor
brought in the winning time for the
Generals.

At least one General placed in
all the events except for the medley
relay. McManus and John Wolfe
came in second and third in the 200-
yard freestyle while Blaire Brown
came in third in the 200-yard indi-
vidual medley.

Both Bart Taylor and Chase placed
in the 50-yard freestyle. Taylor, a
strong point in freestyle competition,
also came in second in the 100-yard
freestyle.

Dave Geer and Bruce Houghton

the 200-yard butterfly; Broaddus and
Steve Lunde in the 200-yard back-
stroke; George Bokinsky third in the
500-yard freestyle and Jim Wallen-
stein and Gary Bokinsky in the
200-yard breast stroke.

By TOM WHITE

Top game of the week in basket-
ball found a tough Delt team up-
setting strong ZBT, 48-40. Both teams
had figured to be among the tops
in the league. Delt still must face
Sigma Chi, Law, and defending
champ SAE, who did not play this
week.

Favored Sigma Nu, last year’s sec-
ond place finishers, notched victory
number two of the season with a
35-24 victory over KA. Sigma Nu
figures to be one of the leading con-
tenders for SAE’s crown.

Beta beat Lambda Chi 45 to 23,
but, in their second game of the
week, Lambda Chi shot back with
47-23 victory over SPE. PEP’S hopes
for the season were dashed with two
losses... 35-23 to Phi Psi, and 43
to 31 to Phi Kappa Sig.

The best: 1. SAE, 1-0; 2. Sigma
Nu, 2-0; 3. Delt, 1-0. Top game of
next week: SAE against Law. Prob-
able winner: SAE.

In handball, defending champ Beta
picked up victory number two the
easy way...a forfeit win over NFU,
who also forfeited to Sigma Chi.
Strong Phi Delt downed Kappa Sig
and shut out Phi Phi, 5-0. PiKA top-
ped Phi Gam, while Law forfeited
for the second time to give KA the
victory.

No change apparent in this week’s
ratings. The best: 1. Beta, 2-0; 2.
Delt, 1-0; 3. PiKA, 2-0.

Defending champion Phi Kappa
Sig picked up victory number two
of the bowling season this week with
a win over PiKA. In the week’s
other matches DU won their first
match of the season as they downed
PEP, who now have a 0-3 record;
and Phi Delt also won their first
match as they tripped once beaten
Lambda Chi, 3-1.

The best: 1. Kappa Sig, 2-0; 2.
Phi Psi, 2-0; 3. Phi Kappa Sig, 2-0.

Last year’s champ, Phi Psi evened
their record at 1-1 by downing ZBT
in wrestling. Phi Phi forfeited their
second match of the season... this
one to DU, who now sports a 2-0
record. In the week’s remaining
matches, Beta downed Phi Kappa
Sig, 25-13, and a strong Delt team
won over Kappa Sig.

No change from last week’s rat-
ings. The best: 1. Phi Gam, 2-0, 2.
Phi Delt, 1-0; 3. KA, 2-0.

*Agnew Leads Squad;

Sewanee Places Four

College Athletic Conference cham-
pion Sewanee and runner-up Wash-
ington and Lee each placed four
men on the 1963 All-CAC football
team.

Sewanee’s Little All-American tail-
back M. L. Agnew led the 13-man
team picked by the conference’s five
coaches. Agnew is a repeater from
last year, along with Sewanee’s end
Bob Davis and Southwestern’s tackle
Challice McMillin.

The Generals placed end Buck

Ogilvie, fullback Henry Sackett,
tackle Jim Sylvester, and guard
George Gossman on the squad.

Tie votes at two positions—guard
and tackle—resulted in the confer-
ence’s second straight 13-man team.

Rounding out the squad were
guard Bob Rice and tackle Jim
Stewart of Sewanee, halfback Jon
Mars, Washington, quarterback Bert
Chafin and guard Bill Edington of
Southwestern, and center Tom Tay-
lor, of Centre.

Agnew and Davis were the only
unanimous choices. Five players got
three of the four votes possible (a
coach cannot vote for his own play-
ers). They were Sackett, Mars, Cha-
fin, Rice, and Stewart. Junior Jim
Stewart and sophomore Chafin were
the only underclassmen to make the
team.

Agnew practically rewrote the
conference record books in 1963, set-
ting new marks for rushing (835
yards), total offense (1,342 yards),
and scoring (60 points).

He is joined in the backfield by
Sackett (633 yards rushing), Chafin
(895 yards passing), and Mars, who

Catholic on Tuesday

Next Tuesday Washington and Lee’s basketball team will
meet the school that Coach Bob McHenry calls our toughest
regular season opponent. Catholic University will travel here
from Washington, hoping to repeat last year’s 65-41 victory.

This year’s Catholic team has only a 3-2 record thus far.
Their two defeats were by four points to Providence, last year’s
NIT champion and winner of 15 straight, and by two points
in overtime to Seton Hall, who has back last year’s leading
scorer, Mike Werkman.

McHenry said first team center Howie Martin, suffering
from a mild concussion, will not be able to play again until
after Christmas.

 

Sackett, Ogilvie, Sylvester Honored

Washington and Lee joined Hampden-Sydney and Emory
and Henry in placing three men on the AP’s Virginia small-
college football team, announced Tuesday. Fullback Henry
Sackett, end Buck Ogilvie, and tackle Jim Sylvester drew hon-
ors for the Generals.

Hampden-Sydney sophomore quarterback Whitey Lips-
comb was named captain of the team. His backfield was round-
ed out by E&H’s Earl Hawkins and C. A. Burton. Other mem-
bers of the team: end George Ueilig (H-S), tackle Purvis
Edwards (Frederick), guards Bill Bryant (E&H) and Sid
Druen (H-S), and center Billy Webster (Randolph-Macon).

Randolph-Macon, rated as the best
in Virginia small college basketball.

Several times Bridgewater caught
up, but in the end W&L held out
for a 66-62 victory. Leading the
General scoring was Paterno with
22, followed by Spessard with 12,
and Mindel with 11. Spessard also
led in rebounds with 17, while
freshman starter Jeff Twardy had 11
and Mindel 8.

Bridgewater’s Browder was the
game’s high scorer, with 23 points.

With many lettermen returning
Centre will be tough this year. In
their last two outings the Colonels
have scored over 90 points. Employ-
ing a strong offense, they like a fast
break.

Outstanding are last year’s all
CAC Tournament choices, center
Hal Smith and Guard Bel Borland.
Their leading scorer this year is
sophomore forward Mike Marks,
who would have made all tourna-
ment team had he not been a fresh-
man.Marks is 64”, and with 675”
sophomore Renny Waltz at the other
forward, the Colonels should not
have much trouble off the boards.

In last year’s game the Generals
got off to a quick start, gaining a
10 point lead at half-time, but Centre
fought back in the second half to
win 82-78.

W&L may be forced to shoot more
than it likes because of the Colonels’
pressing defense. The Generals will
be hurt on rebounds with starting
center Howard Martin still out,
but Coach Bob McHenry expects
him to be back in shape right after
the Christmas break.

Tuesday the Generals take on the
toughest opponent of the year, here
at W&L. Catholic University was
number two in the NIT tournament
last year. This year they lost to
Providence, last year’s NIT cham-
pion, by four points. In last year’s

Dance Board vice-president Steve

The costumes are being rented out
for the Mardi Gras ball on Friday
night of Fancy Dress. The rental
is handled by the Oak Hill Com-
pany of Roanoke.

Hibbard stated that in response to
a number of requests, another one-

vacation.

The cost of rental is $8.00, a de-
crease of $4.50 from last year. Cos-
tumes rental in pairs are $14.00.

“They are to be of the nature of
a ball room setting in contrast to
the street scene motif,’ Hibbard
commented. We hope that students
will take advantage of the wide var-
iety and high quality of costumes
that Oak Hall is offering.”

The date of the costumes sale in
January will be announced later,
Hibbard stated.

But while Goldwater waits and
reassesses the new situation, time
for his planning a campaign for the
New Hampshire primary grows
shorter and shorter. The Rockefeller
campaign is becoming consolidated
in New Hampshire, and if Goldwater
tries to enter the race at a late date
he may find himself losing a state he
ought to win if early polls are to be
believed. Rockefeller has been cam-
paigning for a month, and campaign-
ing thoroughly.

And while both Rockefeller and
Goldwater forces wait out the pro-
litical moratorium honoring John
F. Kennedy, the “darkhorses” come
into more and more prominence.
Cabot Lodge manages to get pub-
licity all the way from South Viet
Nam, perhaps due to the influence
of General Eisenhower. Pennsyl-

the Republican hope to appropri-
ate the old Kennedy image of

Johnson than he did against Ken-

However, these are conditions that
are not outside our control, they do
not work through some mysterious
means. If we are to determine the
course of our future and not allow
our future to be determined by fac-
tors inconsistent with our goals, we
need only, to a large extent, recog-
nize the interrelated nature of many
social and economic problems; and
set the course of action along such
interrelated lines. Labor’s Economic
Review has recently published ar-

ticles which offer that “meeting
America’s social needs (public
schools, housing, urban renewal,

community facilities, hospitals) will
meet America’s job needs.” Much of

that body.

Of course, such unfortunate con-
troversy could easily be prevented
by the EC itself if that group would
only publicize its proceedings and
voluntarily open a discussion on the
rightfulness of its powers. We would
like to see the EC show that it
believes that school government
should be a “mutual thing.”

sions built up by unemployment
which has generally hit the Negro
harder than any one group.
Amplifying TVA Plan

We have in the past moved for-
ward to solve connecting needs by
formulating concrete and significant
planning. TVA is perhaps the best
example of a successful program
that moved into a depressed area not
with limited designs on improve-
ment but with a general assessment
of the situation. While the ideas
of TVA have been avidly studied by
other nations and implemented in
such countries as Ceylon, Parkistan,
and India, we have failed to make
full use of this valuable concept of
“a corporation clothed with the pow-
er of government but possessed with
the flexibility and initiative of priv-
ate enterprise.”—Franklin Roosevelt.

We must finally come to recognize
that if American democracy is to
have meaning in the Twentieth Cen-
tury both domestically and to the
newer nations of the Afro-Asian
Bloc, we must combine the power of
