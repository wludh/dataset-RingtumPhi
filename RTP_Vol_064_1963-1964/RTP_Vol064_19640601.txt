Dr. Cole also will make the gradu-
ation remarks, a tradition followed
by Washington and Lee’s presidents
for more than 30 years.

Also scheduled to speak during
the ceremony which approximately
1,700 faculty members, parents and
friends are expected to attend, will

Fifty-three students will be com-
missioned Second Lieutenants, with
three accepting Regular Army com-
missions, and three will be commis-
sioned Second Lieutenants in the
Marine Corps.

Sprunt To Give Baccalaureate

Dr. David W. Sprunt will deliver
the baccalaureate sermon to the
class of 1964 in a service at 11 am.

Ten New Professors Jon WGL Faculty;
Dr. Roberts To Head Biology Department

 

A new head of the Department
of Biology was announced today
by Dean of the College William
W. Pusey, along with the names of
ten other men who will join the
University faculty in September.

Dr. Henry S. Roberts, 51, now
associate professor of zoology and
acting director of graduate study
in zoology at Duke University, will
become professor of biology and
will succeed Dr .Kenneth P. Stevens
as head of Washington and Lee’s
biology program. Dr. Stevens is
retiring in June after 18 years on
the University faculty.

Also named by Dean Pusey were
two new assistant professors and
eight new instructors, including one
who will hold the title of “artist in
residence.”

Appointments as assistant profes-
sors include Sterling M. Boyd, 30,
in fine arts, and George W. Ray,
32, in English.

Appointed instructor in fine arts
was Ray Prohaska, 63, noted New
York painter and illustrator who
will become “artist in residence” at
Washington and Lee next year.

Other new instructors for 1964-65
include:

John M. Evans, 28, English; John
P. Freeman, 27, chemistry; William
E. Hannum, 24, English; Irving M.
Lynn, Jr., 24, German; Larry A.
Schmucker, 30, philosophy; Sydney
J. Williams, Jr., 26, Romance lan-
guages; and Anthony Wood, 25,

Dean Pusey said the new faculty
members include replacements for
professors on leave as well as new
additions to the University’s teach-
ing staff.

Barritt, Sensabaugh Given Leave
To Study In Cooperative Program

Two Washington and Lee profes-
sors have been named fellows in a
Cooperative Program in the Hu-
manities sponsored jointly by Duke
University and the University of
North Carolina.

Dr. C. Westbrook Barritt, profes-
sor of romance languages, and Dr.
Leon F. Sensabaugh, professor of
history, will participate in the pro-
gram during the 1964-65 academic
year.

The program, made possible by a
five year grant from the Humani-
ties and Arts Program of the Ford
Foundation to Duke University and
the University of North Carolina,
will allow Dr. Barritt and Dr.
Sensabaugh to do research in their
fields of interest at either institu-
tion.

The program, to operate for the
first time this fall, is planned to give
distinguished faculty members in

 

the humanities a year to study and
and do research in their particular
fields of interest.

Two advanced graduate students
from Duke or North Carolina will
appointed to the Washington and
Lee faculty for the academic year.
Dr. Barritt and Dr. Sensabaugh are
participating in the special program.

Dr. Barritt has taught at Wash-
ington and Lee since 1952. Previous-
ly he was instructor in Spanish dur-
ing the 1947-48 academic year and
also has taught at Muhlenberg Col-
lege and Emory University.

Dr. Sensabaugh came to Wash-
ington and Lee in 1956 as Dean of
the University after teaching at
Birmingham-Southern College for
20 years where he was head of the
Department of History and Political
Science and chairman of the Divi-
sion of Social Science from 1943 to
1956.

By MIKE HASH

Lee have exceeded those of any
year on record, according to Dean
of Admissions James D. Farrar. The
total number of final applications
submitted to the Admissions Office
was 1480 which compares with 1270
of the previous year. Of these ap-
plicants 623 were offered admission.
and 340 have confirmed their places
in the Class of 1968.

Statistics are not yet available
on the distribution of the class or
their average on the Scholastic Ap-
titude Test. Dean Farrar could give
no indication of the ratio between
students from public and private
institutions, but he did feel that the

most impressive. The class of '68
includes forty sons of alumni which
is a considerable increase from last
year.

High Quality of Applicants

In commenting further on the
class Dean Farrar attributed the
high quality of applicants to an

increased pregram of guidance on
the secondary school level. “We
had very few applicants who did
not present adequate credentials.”
Dean Farrar also stated that the
real test of any class will be the
results of the first semester.

The selection of the freshman
class is the responsibility of the
Committee on Admissions. The mem-
oun of this year’s committee are:

Financial Aid

Dean Lewis G. John also an-
nounced the program of financial
aid which will be offered to ap-
proximately 20 per cent of the in-
coming freshmen. There are 10 full
scholarships: 6 Lee and 4 Baker.
The University’s grant-loan program
has been made available to a
total of of 41 freshmen. In addi-
tion one freshman will be employed
at the Commons and another will
receive a Rockbridge County Grant.

Each year a certain number of
Washington Awards are given to
those freshmen, who in the opin-
ion of the Scholarship Committee,
possess outstanding qualifications,
but fail to demonstrate real need.
These awards are primarily in rec-
ognition of superior academic
achievement, although $100 is ap-
plied to tuition. There are 9 Wash-
ington Award winners in the in-
coming class.

Dean John said that of those stu-
dents who applied for financial aid,
the committee was able to offer as-
sistance to all who were well quali-
fied and demonstrated a real need.
The total amount of financial aid
given to members of the new fresh-
man class is $63,940. This represents
an inerease of about $20,000 from last
year.

IFC Takes Rush
Out Of Rushing
With New Rules

By SYD LEWIS

Washington and Lee’s traditional
rush system will undergo a major
revamping next fall. Instead of the
rush into the dorms and mad dash
in order to persuade freshmen to
visit a certain fraternity house,
freshmen will be asked to designate
fraternities they wish to see dur-
ing the first two days of rush
called “open houses.”

No rushee will be allowed to see
a house more than once during
“open houses” and must see a min-
imum of ten fraternities. “Open
houses” will last forty minutes and
no intoxicating beverages may be
served during this time.

Dorm Rushing Limited

After the first two days, a sub-
dued form of the old rushing for-
mat will be followed. The fraternities
will rush the dorms; however, only
four members of each fraternity will
be allowed to enter the dorms.
Freshmen will sign up to see fra-
ternities at formal rush dates where
beer may be served.

Because of the parking problem
near the freshmen dorms, only Phi
Kappa Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Zeta Beta Tau, Pi Kappa Phi, Lamb-
da Chi, Phi Epsilon Pi, Delta Upsi-
lon, and Kappa Sigma will be allow-
ed to use cars to transport rushees.

Summer Rush Important

The new rushing system, accord-
ing to several fraternity rushing
chairmen, will shift considerable
emphasis of the rushing programs to
the summer months. A considerable
amount of work will be spent on
contacting prospective rushees to
insure that they sign up for a certain
house during the “open rush” dates.

The general rush rules concern-
ing fraternity etiquette, contact
with freshmen, and fining remain
the same. In accordance with the
rising cost of living, the freshmen
rushing fee has been raised from
three to five dollars and a seven
dollar fifty cent fee for late pay-
ments.

The changes were made in the new
IFC constitution which was submit-
ted this year.

«party, has already announced that
the party will begin as soon as the
last exam is over Tuesday afternoon.
The Delacardos will be on hand
to provide music and the drink for
afternoon will be gin and juice.
The cocktail party will run until
about seven. Candler has knowingly
predicted “quite a lively party.”
Tuesday Night Concert

The Serendipity Singers will per-
form from 8 to 10 p.m. that evening
for the concert in Doremus gym-
nasium. Originating at the University
of Colorado, this group of seven
men and two women came to na-
tional fame several months ago with
their big hit “Don’t Let the Rain
Come Down.”

Featuring a sound much like that
of the New Christy Minstrels, the
Serendipity Singers were discovered
by Fred Weintraub, a New York
City night club owner. Since they
became nationally known, they have
played at clubs in New York, Chi-
cago, and on a number of “Hoote-
nanny” television shows.

Wednesday has nothing officially
planned for the dance set, although
there will be a number of parties
thrown by fraternity groups.

Reception at Cole’s

Thursday night there will be a
reception at president Cole’s home
for graduating seniors, their dates,
and parents. This reception will be
from nine to ten. At ten the Senior
Dance will begin in the Evans Din-
ing Hall. Music is to be provided
by the Joe Lynn Quintet, a local
group which played at the same
occasion last year.

Ken Lane, a graduating Phi Delt
senior, is Finals Dance President.
The following are his vice presi-
dents: Ed Croft, a KA from Atlanta,
is in charge of the figure; Brice
Gamber, a Delt from Baltimore, is
handling publicity; Peter Candler, a
KA from Atlanta, is in charge of
the cocktail party; Jere Cravens, a
SPE from Tulsa, has charge of the
invitations; and Conway Shields,
a PiKA from Newport News, is
handling the decorations for the
concert. Bill Noell, an SAE from
Bluefield, West Virginia, and Roger
Paine, a Phi Gam from Arlington,
are honorary vice presidents.

Combo Parties Scheduled

The Rhythm Makers will be at KA
from 9 to 2 Wednesday morning and
afternoon, and the Ambassadors
will be at the Girl Scout Camp from
2 to 6 Wednesday afternoon. Night
parties are planned.

The Glory and the Dream

Conservatism goes for comfort; reform for truth.
—Ralph Waldo Emerson

Generally young men are regarded as radicals.
This is a popular misconception. The most conser-
vative persons I have ever met are college under-

graduates.
—Woodrow Wilson

Four years ago an editor of this newspaper wrote an
editorial entitled “Brink of Greatness.” In it he expressed
his belief that Washington and Lee was poised on the
threshold of a new and progressive era—an era that would
catapult W&L to the top of the academic world. But in
the past four years, W&L has, if anything, backed farther
away from greatness than ever, and it continues to dis-
grace the liberal, courageous, and humanitarian spirit
which characterizes both its namesakes. Here are a few
of the reasons:

Washington and Lee is bound to bigotry. Narrow-
minded, segregationist views which belong in the 1870's
are holding W&L at a standstill while the rest of the South
and the nation moves ahead faster every year. We should
declare ourselves an open school, both racially and relig-
iously; we should cast aside the bigots who contribute
their money but who attach all-white strings to it. There
is an ample amount of money to be had from organiza-
tions and individuals who have recognized the fact that
even Negroes are human.

Washington and Lee persists in Victorian standards of
morality. Drinking is prohibited at football games and at
school dances and concerts. A student must decide for
himself whether or not he wants to drink alcoholic bever-
ages, but the Board of Trustees must not be allowed to
decide whether he can drink at a football game or a jazz
concert. This prohibition is just as backward and anti-
quated as the tacit prohibition against Negro students.

Washington and Lee is allowing its fraternity system
to weaken and die. Despite the passage of a new IFC con-
stitution this year, fraternities are falling apart. They can-
not possibly survive as anything more than eating clubs
when their members are spread all over Lexington in
apartments. Students move to apartments for one primary
reason: so they will have a quiet, private place to take
their dates. There is no reason why fraternity houses
shouldn’t serve that purpose as well as apartments. Wo-
men should be allowed on the upper floors of all fra-
ternity houses, and into the upperclass dorms.

The first objection to opening fraternities and dorms
in this manner is that it would encourage sexual promis-
cuity. We submit that if a student and his date want to
have sexual intercourse, they will find a place to go one
way or another. The main point is that fraternity men
would enjoy living in their houses much more if their
rooms were open to girls; this would increase house
solidarity and brotherhood immensely. The administra-
tion must want fraternities to die out, but when they go,
it will be one more shovelful of dirt on W&L’s rapidly-
filling grave.

Washington and Lee has an oligarchic form of student
government which tends toward corruption. It is corrupt
because its leader’s pet phrase this year has been “‘let’s put
the ‘quietus’ on this.” It is corrupt because it manipu-
lates into positions of authority only those students whose
minds are sufficiently straitjacketed to passively accept
all of W&L’s sacred cows. It is corrupt because it squelches
debate, and thereby encourages stagnation.

Washington and Lee allows puerility to exist in some
of its student leaders. Here is a case in point: a member
of the Publications Board stopped one of this year’s can-
didates for election to the editorship of the Ring-tum Phi
before the elections were held. He told the candidate
he hated him so much he did not plan to vote in the elec-
tion, because he could not possibly be objective in his vot-
ing. That student voted in the election anyway, as it was
his privilege to do—but it is safe to assume his vote was
cast in hatred, without any consideration for the merits of
the candidate. That same student and others like him will
not consider the merits of this editorial, and for the same

reason.

Washington and Lee tries to make very simple things
out of situations which are highly complex. An example
is the honor system. The founding fathers of this system
must have had in mind an ideal community—one in
which no dishonest men would remain. But into this ideal
community that is W&L come fallible young men who are
in the process of learning. They have a lot to learn about
life as well as the arts when they first step on campus.
Every student bravely believes his honor is strong—that
it will stand up under pressure. Some students find that
personal or academic problems drive them to do some-
thing they wouldn’t ordinarily do, and they wind up per-
manently expelled from W&L on an honor violation.

The American system of law recognizes the complex-
ities involved in various types of crimes, and adjusts its

Edward C. Atwood, Jr.:
A New Era For W&L

The Ring-tum Phi this year sa-
lutes Dean of Students Edward C.
Atwood, Jr., for his outstanding
contribution to Washington and Lee
as an administrator, a professor, and
a willing friend to all members of

| the student body.

Dean Atwood’s accomplishments
fall into two major categories—the
tangible and the intangible. On the

| surface is the work he did to help
_ secure for Washington and Lee a
' more liberal cut system. There is

his constant and understanding work
with the Interfraternity Council to
help draft a new constitution. Dean

_ Atwood never attempted to force

his opinion on any student; rather,
he was willing to offer it if asked.
His words were thus made all the

_ more valuable.

On a deeper and less evident
level of accomplishment are the
hundreds of private conferences
which Dean Atwood has held with
members of the student body. His
guidance, his encouragement, and
his reprimands have favorably af-
fected the lives of scores of
W&L students. Though his job as
Dean of Students involves some
responsibilities which cannot often
be pleasantly carried out, Dean
Atwood brings to this job a sense

 

  

After graduation this year, the
Board of Trustees will meet to dis-
cuss the future of Washington and
Lee. These are the people who are
ultimately entrusted with the preser-
vation and the policy of our school.
And, fortunately, they have shown
themselves to be capable and
thoughtful people, for they have
made Washington and Lee the aca-
demic success it is.

But this year the board will feel
more intensely the pressure that
has been mounting in recent years—
the pressure caused by the tre-
mendous social problem our whole
country faces, that of integration.

Pressure More Intense

The pressure will be more in-
tense this year for several reasons.
There can be little doubt that
Negroes and concerned whites all
over the nation will be agitating
more than ever this year to try to
assure for Negroes their rightful
place in our society. Brother schools
in the South have already inte-
grated or are planning to do so.
Even some of the neighboring pri-
vate girls’ schools have announced
expected changes in their admissions
policies. And in our own school,
there are sizeable numbers of fac-
ulty and students who are interested
and anxious to see an inter-racial
student body here.

So the board must consider once
more this year what it is going to
do about integration. As it now is,
the policy is to wait and hope. As
far as can be gleaned from sources

A Look at Washington and Lee

 

 

1964’s Summer of Decision
For The Board of Trustees

By Lamar Lamb

here, Washington and Lee will re-
ceive any application from qualified
male applicants. If a Negro applies
and is found qualified, Dr. Cole will
refer his application to the Board
of Trustees. Then Washington and
Lee’s policy toward Negroes will be
decided.

Present Policy Wrong

To my way of thinking, there are
several things wrong with this poli-
cy. The most obvious is that the
whole future of our school is left
to chance or to the NAACP (ironi-
cally), whichever happens to act
first. As it now is, we are waiting
for a Negro to apply, and (assumed-
ly) hoping none does. So right now,
thereis one Negro boy somewhere
in this country, one who is intelli-
gent, “clean,” and a rising senior in
high school, and this Negro boy
holds the fate of Washington and
Lee—at least in one sense—in his
hands.

There are other obvious things
wrong with our policy. Washington
and Lee is very proud of the fact
that a large percentage of its gradu-
ates grow to be civic, state and na-
tional leaders. We can assume that
many people who are now studying
at Washington and Lee will some-

day have a great deal of influence

Failing of W&L

But in effect, Washington and Lee
is training leaders who will have
no knowledge—or at best accidental
knowledge—of the most pressing
domestic issue of the century. No
matter what one’s feelings and be-
liefs on the subject, race relations
will be a problem that will confront
all of us the rest of our lives.
And yet, at the place where we
should learn to think about these
problems, we find a void, a desperate
and hopeful void which says, “ig-
nore the problem, maybe it will go
away.”

(Continued on page 5)

 

of tact and understanding which
is truly rare.

One of Dean Atwood’s greatest
attributes is the image of W&L
which he portrays both to alumni
and to prospective freshmen. His
ivy-league dress, his impeccable
manners, and his tendency to allow
the other person to dominate the
conversation while he himself care-
fully controls it all reflect the calm
strength and decision of Washing-
ton and Lee.

Dean Atwood’s long apprentice-
ship offers the reason for his pres-
ent competence. He first joined the
faculty here in 1952 as an assistant
professor of economics. He was pro-
moted to associate professor in 1959,
but a year later he left W&L to join
the General Electric Company’s staff
of economists in New York.

In February, 1962, Dean Atwood
was named Dean of Students suc-
ceeding Frank J. Gilliam. He re-
sumed his duties as professor of
economics here. Since then he has
held the position of Dean of Stu-
dents, and with President Fred C,
Cole promises to do an outstanding
job of leading W&L into its new-
est era.

Dean Atwood earned his B.A.,
M.A, and Ph.D. degrees from
Princeton University. He came to

a W&L originally from Denison Uni-
| versity where he was an instructor

in economics. During World War II

. he served in the U.S. Navy. On
| March 30, 1946, he married June
‘|Ruschmeyer; they have two chil-

dren, Terry and Jeff.

It is impossible to measure the
good which Edward C. Atwood,
Jr., has done for Washington and
Lee in two short years as Dean of
Students. What he will do in his
remaining career at W&L is limited

‘| only by the bounds of a free imagi-

nation. His open-mindedness, his
willingness to listen to the other
side of any question, his public and
private demeanor, and most of all his
unquestionable moral integrity earn
for him this very insufficient en-
comium from those of us who have
both favored and opposed him all
year long in our editorial columns.
We all join in unqualified salute to
an exceptional man.

ton and Lee Mock Convention nom-

= ' Pi s inated Senator Barry Goldwater as
. ’ = the 1964 GOP nominee for the pres-

i fe : : Scranton as the vice-presidential
REPUBLIC ‘AN , : = nominee.

: J io” F : These choices were immediately
broadcast Giveashinc! the nation by
means of newspaper, radio, and tel-

evision coverage unprecedented in
Mock Convention history. On the
national scene, W&L received full

coverage in Time magazine along
with pictures and a compliment.

AP and UPI Coverage

The Associated Press and United
Press International ran preliminary
stories describing the convention
and then bulletins announcing the
results.

The New York Times and the
Washington Post both ran extensive
stories about the convention until
Goldwater was nominated. On the
state level, news coverage was com-
plete with front page stories.

The Mock Convention is not treat-
ed lightly by the political pros. The
convention has picked the winners
in eight out of twelve convention
years, and has gained such a rap-
port with the politicians that this
year’s convention received gener-
ous financing by the candidates.

f toy

Several state party chairmen and
campaign representatives for the
major candidates were also here for
the balloting.

Political Trends Forecast
Immediately following the con-
vention there was a good deal of
skepticism as to the accuracy of
the decision made. In the past three
weeks, a clearer perspective shows
that at least some of the political

Trustees Need
To Make A
Positive Stand

(Continued from page 2)

But like the grasshopper who play-
ed all summer hoping that winter
wouldn’t come, W&L will have to
meet the problem sooner or later.
Each student at Washington and
Lee will face the problem more
than once in the years after he
leaves here. If we have not planned
for the eventuality, it will be hard
on us all,

Refusal to Face the Facts

What we should be working on
is how to conquer the problems
that will arise when a Negro does
come—fraternities, freshman camp,
the dorms, ete. But our hands are
tied because we refuse to recognize
the problem. |

Last week, Rod Cockshutt rightly |
declared in his column, “a univer-
sity’s success or failure depends on
the extent to which it challenges
the minds of its students to con-
front new, often unpalatable ideas.”
But at Washington and Lee, both
the school and the student body do
not confront a very old idea— a
man, because he is a man, should be
treated as an equal.

Washington and Lee cannot let
such pettiness and fear ruin the
good it does in the academic realm.
It would be sad to see such a small
thing cause the foundations of a
great institution to crack or crumble.
But that has happened before, and
will again. Hopefully, the Board of
Trustees will decide that it won’t
happen here.

‘The Glory And The Dream’

(Continued from page 2)

penalties to meet the seriousness of the crime. Here at
W&L, faced with the same complexities as to types of
honor violations, we have only one penalty for the con-
victed student. We suggest that at the very least a student
from the senior law or undergraduate class be elected each
year to act as a defense counsel for every accused violator.
Ideally, the permanent expulsion penalty should be re-
duced to a one-year expulsion.

Washington and Lee should not persist in the hypocri-
sy of calling itself a Christian institution. The catalogue
states that an “enduring adherence of the University is
its dedication to the Christian ideal.” To the contrary:
We&L is not merciful to its honor violators; W&L does
not forgive these students; W&L only judges and con-
demns. W&L does not love, for it will not declare its
doors open to all capable men, and a love which is quali-
fied is not love at all.

Finally, Washington and Lee will persist in this ostrich-
eye view of life. We don’t have all the answers to W&L’s
problems. Some students here think they do. The trouble
is that these same students have not even begun to ask
the questions. The administration and the faculty are slow-
ly and desperately trying to back W&L into the twentieth
century. But the student body, basking in apathy, is wear-
ing what Dietrich Bonhoeffer called “the blinkers of
perfectionism” which prevent one from seeing his own
faults. For this reason and those mentioned above, W&L
will remain just where it is right now—on the brink of
greatness, forever.

It is not now as it hath been of yore;—
Turn wheresoe’er I may,
By night or day,
The things which I have seen I now can see no more.

Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
Where is it now, the glory and the dream?

—William Wordsworth

’°64 Convention
In Retrospect

(Continued from page 4)
trends were correctly forecast by
our state chairmen.

Most eye-catching of all is the
present trend in California, which
shows Governor Nelson Rockefeller

 

Notice

 

| Goldwater

 

of New York leading Goldwater.
At the time of the convention, when
our California delegation decided to
go for Rockefeller, there ws con-
siderable criticism as to the wiseness
of the decision. The pros are cer-
tainly no longer predicting a Gold-
water landslide in California, as they
were when we held the convention.

Time Vindicates Our Judgement

Even without California, however,
won our convention.

 

Time confirmed W&L views in the
May 22 edition. It showed that even
with a win in Oregon and a po-
tential victory in California, Rocke-
feller still lagged far behind in the
pack of the candidates.

Especially significant is the fact
that, unknown to W&L, Time was
writing a pre-convention story
which indicated strongly that Gold-
water and Scranton would, in their
estimation, receive the nominations.
One day after our convention, this

 

 

issue reached the campus and vin-
dicated our judgment.

In the same edition, Time quoted
several probable votes of various
committed and uncommitted states;
these votes tallied in many cases

with the exact vote totals given
at W&L.

Such indications have encouraged
the Steering Committee as to the
efficacy of the nominations made
here.
