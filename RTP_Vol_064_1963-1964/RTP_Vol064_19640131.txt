Rubin’s Band Highlights
1963-64 Fancy Dress Bal

By WARREN MONTGOMERY
The Fancy Dress Ball tonight will be highlighted by Stan Rubin and his thirteen-piece or- |

chestra. The Ball will begin at 9 p.m. at Evans Dining Hall.
Rubin’s nationally known Dance Orchestra has made previous appearances at Washington

and Lee. A contingent of his
FD Ball.

With the “Mardi Gras” theme as
its setting, the dance will also fea-
ture the traditional Figure, follow-
ed at 10:30 by a special concert of
popular gospel singing.

The Cocktail Party

The Faney Dress Weekend was
launched this afternoon by the IFC
Cocktail Party, which featured the
Essex. The party was given at the
Moose Lodge at 4 o’clock. The three-
member Essex group gave a two
and a half hour performance. They
became famous as recording stars
with their two hits “Walking Mir-
acle” and “Easier Said Than Done.”

Following the Cocktail Party is a
banquet for the members of the
Figure and of the Faculty Social
Functions Committee at the Robert
E. Lee Hotel. The banquet is given

in honor of FD president, Randy:

Wootton.

Dance Board president Ed Croft
reminds students that appropriate
costumes are required at the Ball
tonight. Students in tuxedos will not
be admitted.

New Orleans Decorations

The main event of the weekend, the
Fancy Dress Ball itself, will begin
at 9:00 tonight in Evans Hall. The
theme of the Ball is, of course,
Mardi Gras, and this theme will be
borne out as fully as possible. Evans
Dining Hall will be virtually turned
into a New Orleans street scene for
the occasion. Eight-foot carnival
masks will line the walls, and a 28-
foot-wide backdrop will be behind
the bandstand. The backdrop, a mur-
al embellished with lanterns, will
give the effect of actually being on a
festive New Orleans street during

Mardi Gras. Additional local color
will be furnished by a colonnade
through the hall, picket fences, and
a grass plot with a fountain in the
center.

The costumes worn by those at-
tending will present an unlimited
array of types. In fact, the purpose
of the Mardi Gras theme is to spice
up the Ball with variety, to en-
courage originality, and to make it
easy for everyone to come up with
a costume. The only limiting require-
ment is that real costumes be worn.
Street clothes, tuxedos and distaste-
ful or shoddy apparel will not be
considered costumes. Dates must
wear costumes or formal gowns, and
white tie and tails is acceptable for
men.

Evans Hall will be opened at 8:00
p.m., and the Figure will begin
the festivities at 9. The Figure, a
formal presentation of the dance set
officialdom, will include President
of the Dance Board Ed Croft, Vice-
president Steve Hibbard, Fancy
Dress President Randy Wootton,
Wootton’s six vice-presidents, and
the presidents of the eighteen frater-
nities.

Jazz and Gospel

Stan Rubin and his orchestra will
open the dance itself with a suite
to W&L, composed by Mr. Rubin and
based on the melody of the Washing-
ton and Lee Alma Mater.

At 10:30, two gospel groups will
give a brief concert. The first group
will be the Sweet Chariot Singers,
the nucleus of the Sweet Chariot
Club in New York. They will be
followed by the Grandison Singers,
one of the original pop gospel groups.
After the concert, Stan Rubin and

orchestra will continue

Dakota Staton at Concert

Tomorrow, the main event will be
the traditional concert in Doremus
gymnasium. This year, the concert
is in the afternoon, from 2:30 to
4:30 It will feature Dakota Staton
and her trio. Miss Staton is des-
cribed as jazz singer, emphasizing
blues.

The official part of the FD Dance
set will end with the concert, but
of course the weekend will be kept
going with fraternity combos, booze,
and brunches until the girls go back
to their respective schools and we
start a new semester.

‘Hell Week?
Almost Erased

In recent years fraternities across
the nation have been subject to
severe criticism concerning the se-
lective practices and hazing tradi-
tions of such groups. At Washing-
ton and Lee, the practice of being
selective remains; however, pledg-
ing might be losing some of its
active support. Art Broadus, presi-
dent of the Interfraternity Council,
stated that there could not be any
concentrated pledging activities. This
includes “hell week,” but whether
it is meant to include “hell night” is
somewhat unclear.

Eight fraternities have been ques-
tioned as to whether they retain
“hell night” by the Ring-tum Phi in
an effort to determine what the con-
census on this matter was.

Four of the fraternities stated
that they had no hell night at all,
while four fraternities replied that
they still retained hell night even
though one fraternity president
thought that his fraternity was
against the practice.

Those who supported the event
gave such reasons as it was fun or
that it helped bring unity in the
freshman class and gave the pledges
a feeling that they had really done
something to become a_ fraternity
brother. Opponents of hell night
said that it was useless, detrimental
to the pledges, a waste of time, and
that members of the fraternity did
not have time to show up for the
event.

Shenandoah Publication

Professor James Boatwright, fac-
ulty editor to the Shenandoah, has
announced that the new issue of the
Shenandoah, is due to come out some
time at the end of this month.

Appearing in the issue will be
works by George Garrett, Carolyn
Kizer and Oswald Le Winter as well
as poems by James Dickey, an essay |
by Wallace Stevens, and numerous |
reviews. Also there
translations from Apollinaire.

Student’s Article
On Houston
Is Recognized

An article by W&L sophomore
Maurice Fliess has been reprinted
in the Congressional Record by Sen-
ator A. Willis Robertson of Vir-
ginia.

Fliess may be the youngest person
in history to have had a news story
published in the Record. His article
concerns the Gen. Sam Houston
Commemorative Stamp, issued in
December in honor of the Rock-
bridge County native.

Fliess’ story first appeared in the
16 edition of the Roanoke
Times, and was subsequently re-
printed in the Lexington News-Ga-
zette on Dec. 18. On Dec. 20 Senator
Robertson asked the Senate to have
the article on Houston printed in
the Record.

The story as printed consumes
more than a column and a half in
the appendix of the Record. Sen.
Robertson later wrote to Fliess,
“You have written a fine thumb-
nail sketch of a great Virginian for
whom I always have had the great-
est admiration.”

 

Normally, newspaper reprints in
the Record are exclusively editorials
taken from metropolitan publications
and written by veteran journalists.

A Potent Display

To alumni, friends, mavericks, freeloaders, and, above all,
to those of you of the fairer sex, we extend a most cordial wel-

come to the 1964 Washington

and Lee Fancy Dress. We trust

that these three days of bacchanalian madness will provide for
you a pleasant refuge from the problems and tensions of a

tempestuous world outside.

We salute this occasion more than for its escapism, how-
ever; it offers a much-needed reassurance in the face of tomor-

row’s anxieties. For the events

that await you are a display of

energy and power that can transform a world; we are witnessing
amidst our revelry and high spirits a new generation on re-
view, with a show of animation that few nations of the world

can boast of.

To all who are pessimistic,

then, we present living proof

that all our fears are unfounded: concentrated in Shenandoah
Valley this weekend is the latent power that is more than
sufficient to win the Cold War, launch rockets to the moon, and
set our wobbling world back on its axis. Thus comforted, we
join our fellow celebrants in a toast of victory—Challengers of
the future, look on this weekend and beware!

 

Despite Claim of “Polls,”
E. C. Respected by Majority

By DREW BAUR

In spite of claims by certain ques-
tionable polls, there seems to be a
notable change in
the attitude of the
student body to-
ward the Execu-
tive Committee
this semester. Last
year there was an
outspoken fear of
Executive Com-
mittee powers and
at year’s end there
was a fairly size-
able minority of
students who were
in favor of Lamar Lamb’s revisions.
This year, despite the efforts of
certain individuals to change the
EC or discredit it, there can be no
doubt that the Executive Commit-
tee has the support of the vast ma-
jority of the student body.

It is difficult to say what is the
reason for this. Perhaps it is the
fact that the three officers are un-
dergraduates. Among many under-
graduates, especially freshmen and
sophomores, there is a feeling that
the law student body is rather re-
moved from the rest of the school.
Undoubtedly trial by peers is some-
what comforting to many students.
Perhaps the reason is just a general
apathy on the part of the student
body. Perhaps it has been the fact
that fewer people have been asked
to leave this year.

Whatever the reason, this year the

 

Baur

| EC is no longer a feared, but a re-
i spected institution. This is what it
was intended to be, a group working
in the best interests of the student
body. It has finally succeeded in
gaining the confidence of the student
body as a court, not a police force.
Hopefully this trend will continue
further than June, 1964.

Miscellaneous

While the changed EC attitude is
the major positive change this se-
mester, other plaudits should be
given out. The new cut system, the
tremendous job done on Openings
at both concert and cocktail party,
the new assumption of responsibility
by the IFC, the continued excel-
lence of the debate team in inter-
collegiate debate, the Homecoming
football win all contributed to a sig-
nificant rise in school spirit:

BEST BETS FOR THE WEEK-
END: Nelson Rockefeller and Liz
Taylor, Va. Tech to win by 10, big
team at the Stevesville Motel, the
end of exam flick teams, and artil-
lery punch over Sem.

 

Notice

Fraternity freshmen are requested
to eat the evening meal of January
31 in their respective houses and
not the Evans Dining Hall because
of Fancy Dress preparations.

Also, if anybody wants to rent a
Fancy Dress costume, please contact
Steve Hibbard. No tuxedos or inap-
propriate dress will be allowed.

 

 

 

Miss Dakota Staton

“Ball Masque” of 1907
Origin of Fancy Dress

Fancy Dress has come a long way
since it was introduced at Washing-
ton and Lee 57 years ago. In fact,
the 1907 crowd of 20 couples has
been increased to well over a
thousand in the last few years, and
the cost of the dance has spiraled
from $44 to $8,000.

Simple Beginnings

In 1907, Annie Jo White, Presi-
dent of the Dramatic Club, pre-
sented a “Ball Masque” as a re-
ward for the successful actors of
the group. More than half of those
attending were first-classmen at
VMI, and a meager crowd of 40
danced in the old gymnasium, on
the site of the present chemistry
building. The $44 cost was paid
from the Dramatic Club’s profits.

Today, W&L launches an $8,000
extravaganza including a ball, con-
cert, cocktail party, and featuring
Stan Rubin and Orchestra, the Sweet
Chariot Singers, the Grandison Sing-
ers, and Dakota Staton and her Trio.
Fancy Dress has had an interesting
history—a history which has includ-
ed almost every theme imaginable
and most of the nation’s big name
bands.

There have been constant changes
in the organization and method of
presentation of Fancy Dress.

For instance, it was not until 1929
that a student president of the danc-
ing set directed the affair. In that
year, the California Ramblers enter-
tained the partying gentlemen. The
Ramblers came from exotic, far-off

 

Farmville, Va.

But after 1929, the orchestras of
some of the more popular groups
journeyed to Lexington for the oc-
casion. In 1936 Professor Kay Key-
ser of the College of Musical
Knowledge arrived. He was fol-
lowed by Eddie Duchin, Hal Kemp,
Benny Goodman, and Woody Her-
man. Recently we have danced to
the Dorsey Brothers and Les El-
gart.

Publicity-wise, Fancy Dress has
achieved national notice on several
occasions and finally has been titled
what the vice-president for publicity
perennially calls “The South’s Out-
standing College Event.” In 1932,

Walter Winchell came to Fancy,

Dress from Broadway and _ intro-
duced the dance set to the country
in a special radio broadcast. And
almost every year, until several
years ago, Roanoke radio and tele-
vision stations rebroadcast tapes and
films of the ball.

Best Known in South

Fancy Dress has indeed had a
long and colorful history, but there
are still anomalies about its orgins.
Some say that Annie Jo White was
a librarian here in 1907 and that the
Ball started, not in the old gymna-
sium, but in a room above what
is now McCrums, at a party Miss
White gave for her friends. But re-
gardless of how it started, Fancy
Dress has changed in every manner
to become the most liked and talked-
about social event among the col-
leges of the South.

 

Ideologies Lose Significance

With New Era Of Cold Peace

By CHARLIE FLIPPEN |
The Cold War has slowly

become a cold peace and ide-
ologies are gradually ending, a
history professor said here in a

recent lecture.

John Lukacs, a professor at Chest- |
nut Hill College and author of the
book, A History of the Cold War dis-
cussed these ideas on Thursday,
January 16, before the Propaganda
and Psychological Warfare class in
a talk entitled “From Cold War to
Cold Peace: The End of Ideology?”

During the first part of the talk,
Lukaes developed his thesis that the
Cold War has gradually turned into
a cold peace. This has been happen-
ing since 1956, he said.

He listed four major causes for this
change.

1. In 1956 when the United States
did not help the Hungarian revolu-
tionists, Khrushchev became con-
vinced that we would not risk a
war to help free Eastern Europe.

2. Khrushchev has come to realize,
as he has said, that war is no longer
possible as a way of revolution. Thus,
peaceful coexistence has come into
being.

3. The Sino-Soviet quarrel. “I am
convinced that this quarrel will con-
tinue,’ Lukacs said. Russia cannot
afford a divided front. Thus, she
must turn more to Europe and to
better relations with the West.

 

4. Europe has now recovered from |

the war. Therefore, she will no long-
er be as dependent on the United
States as she has been in recent
history, he said. As the European
countries find themselves freer of the
United States, America will be
forced into better relations with the
Soviet Union.

The resulting peace will not be
friendly, however, he said. “It will
be a cold, unfriendly peace.”

This cold peace does not “mean
that the two ideologies will merge,”
Lukaes said.

Rather, as he sees it, the two
ideologies are slowly coming to an
end anyway.

In developing this second major
theme of his talk, the historian
pointed out that ideologies actually
began in the late 18th century.

Religion was then decreasing in
importance, men turned to poli-
tics to solve their problems, he said.

The 1920’s and 30’s were the high
mark of ideological theories. Young
men flocked to the isms as the wave
of the future. Today almost nobody
in Europe and America expects the
ideologies to solve the world’s prob-
lems, he said.

“This does not mean that ideas are
not important any longer,” Lukacs
said. They move slower and are
sometimes not so evident, but they
are vital.

“Ideas are history,” he said.

Lukacs appeared here under the
auspices of the Department of Jour-
nalism and Communications.

 

On October 14 this reporter at-}
tended a meeting of that organization |
which pleases to style itself as
Washington and Lee’s student gov-|
vernment. This body, the EC, this}
Cabal against the life of the Uni-|
versity, met last night shrouded in|
mysterious deep-dark secrecy as
usual, but ‘this time they had a re-|
porter to contend with who was
more persevering than your ordi-|
nary run-of-the-mill reporter.

|

Three times I was thrown out of |

the meeting by the black-robed and

hooded conspirators, but the fourth ,

time I came in wielding the jaw-,

bone of an ass and gained permanent
entry.

Impending Doom of Editors

The first order of business was not
the reading of minutes, since this
top-secret committee dares not keep
any records. The first business was,
rather, the discussion of a secret list
of conscriptions, made up of edi-
tors of the Ring-tum Phi who have
crossed the will of the all-powerful
clique.

The discussion concerned not how
to depose the guilty editors, but in-
stead, how to punish them. The

punishment decreed was that the

 

 

guilty be run through their presses

and printed with their own editor-
ials.
The next item on the EC’s agenda

was a report of some uneasy feeling ||

among the student body regarding
the condition of student government.
The crafty president of the EC dis-
missed these rumors as “absurd
falsehoods” and ended the discus-
sion abruptly by inviting the com-
mittee to his apartment for drinks.
This move was completely obvious
to myself as a mere strategem to
elude the people’s press correspon-
dent. I followed hard on the heels
of the furtive EC members, who

States Survey

(Since W&L is going coed this
weekend, we of the Ring-tum Phi
staff are entering into the spirit of
things with the following survey
on the differences between the
male and his better half. All we
can say is, Vive la difference! Ed.)

The difference between men and
women is even greater than you
may think.

By examining any one of the
body’s approximately 30 trillion cells,
a scientists can tell if it belongs to
a man or a woman.

A man’s brain is slightly heavier
than a woman’s, and the average
red-blooded American male has 10
per cent more red blood cells than
his feminine counterpart. A woman’s
heart beats eight to ten more times
per minute than that of her current
heart-throb; if both live average
life spans, she’s ticked off some
300,000,000 more heartbeats than he
will!

Females Knock-Kneed

“Straight from the shoulder” is
a male attitude. A man’s arms do
hang that way; in women, there’s a
definite bend at the elbow so that
the lower arm extends outward at an
angle. Similarly, a man’s thighs and
legs are in a straight line while a
woman by comparison, seems
knock-kneed her legs bend inward
at the knee.

Relative to a man, a woman has
a longer head, but a shorter neck;
shorter limbs, but a longer trunk;
a seated woman is relatively taller
than a seated man. Her thumb is
shorter, her index finger longer, and
her wrist swivels with more ease—
explaining why women excel at del-
icate manual work.

Though a man’s vocal cords are
longer and thicker than a woman’s,
she apparently gets in not only the

On The Sexes

last word, but the first one, too. Girl
babies tend to speak a little earlier
than boys, and to utter words more
comprehensible to their doting par-
ents. Studying children in the same
social brackets, psychologists found
that little girls use longer sentences
than little boys! Speech therapists
say that stuttering is two to ten times
as common in males as in females.

Here’s an interesting fact to re-
member next time you get involved
in an argument with your sweet-
heart: each sex tends to hear its
own voice better! A woman’s hear-
ing is keener than a man’s in the
higher frequency ranges, while men’s
ears pick up low notes more readily.

Color blindness affects one man in
every 25, but only one woman in
250. Even as tiny babies, females are
apparently more color-conscious; in
tests made on infants aged five and
a half months to 24 months, more
girls than boys grabbed for the
brightly colored discs in preference
to the gray ones.

So far, there’s no conclusive evi-
dence as to which sex has the keener
sense of smell. Both sexes enjoy
fragrance of the right type: accord-
to researchers for the Shulton Com-
pany, makers of men’s and women’s
toiletries, men use a surprising $44
million worth of scented after-shave
lotion each year. Shulton also esti-
mates that more than half the per-
fume worn by women is bought for
them by men as gifts.

The Soldier’s Perfume

Interestingly the stalwalt predeces-
sors of today’s users of Old Spice and
Yorktown had much more “femin-
ine” tastes in scent; Napoleon
poured a bottle of cologne on his
head before each battle! The ancient

The Grandison Singers To Appear At Ball
Page 3

 

By TOM WHITE

The wrap-up of the intramural
wrestling season highlighted an
otherwise light sports schedule the
last week before exams. Kappa Sig
downed Sigma Nu in this week’s
first match, Sigma Nu closing the
season at 0-4, and Kappa Sig at
1-2-1. In the week’s other match,
twice beaten SAE picked up win
number two the easy way... a for-
feiture over PEP, who closed the
season 0-3-1.

With the only wrestling matches
still remaining to be played, post-
ponements, only one team has
clinched a berth in the playoffs...
unbeaten KA who took their division
title with a 4-0 record.

After nine weeks the best: 1. Phi
Gam, 3-0; 2. KA, 4-0; 3. Delt, 2-1.

Handball

Beta moved to within just one
game of wrapping up their divisional
handball league championship, with
a 5-0 victory over DU. Beta, who
still remains undefeated needs only
to down Sigma Chi following exams
to make the playoffs. Sigma Nu re-
mained in contention for their di-
vision’s championship by winding up
the season with a 5-0 win over win-
less Lambda Chi. Sigma Nu finished
the season with a 3-1 record, while
Lambda Chi has an 0-2 record with
two games yet to go. Best chance to
take over first from Sigma Nu:
PiKA, thus far unbeaten in two
starts. In the week’s final match,
Law closed up the season the same
way they started it...with a for-
feiture. Winning the match was SPE
who thus closed up the season with
a 3-1 record, and a chance for the
playoffs—if un-beaten KA stumbles
in its last match against SAE. The
best: 1. Beta, 3-0; Delt, 3-0; 5. KA,
3-0.

Bowling

Beta closed up their bowling sea-
son unbeaten, by virtue of their
victory over previously once beaten
Phi Gam. Beta makes it into the
playoffs with a 4-0 record and
champs in their division. Phi Gam
now sports a 1-2 record. Previous-
ly unbeaten Pi Phi was handed their
first loss of the season by still un-
beaten Phi Psi. Phi Psi moves into
first place in their division with
a 3-0 record, while Pi Phi closed
out the season at 3-1.

In the final week’s match, ZBT
stayed unbeaten with a 3-1 victory
over PiKA. ZBT moved into a two-
way tie for first with Phi Kap after
the victory, with both showing 2-0
records. PiKA’s record now stands
at 1-2.

After the week’s matches, these
look like the best: 1. Phi Kap, 3-0; 2.
SAE, 3-0; 3. Kappa Sig, 3-0.

Exams played the dominant role
in basketball, with no games sched-
uled. So no change from last week’s
ratings. The best: 1. SAE, 3-0, 2.
Sigma Nu, 3-0; 3. PiKA, 3-0.

With a heavy spring intramural
schedule coming up, the Friday
sports staff will endeavor to continue
to bring its readers the top intra-
mural news.

The Generals lay their three-
season 2-18 “there” record on the
line next Thursday at Bristol, Ten-
nessee, where they will play King
College.

Thus far this year, W&L is zero for
four on the road, but fans can find
solace in that this record is better
than that of 1961-62, when they were
0-8.

King College won last year in
Lexington by a 62-58 score in over-
time. But then last year W&L op-
ponents even won here (the Gen-
erals were 2-6 both at home and on
the road in regular season games
last year).

Coach Bob McHenry said of the
home court phenomenon, “In basket-
ball more than any other sport, the
home team has a great advantage.
All baskets are a little bit different.”

Statistics Revealing

In four home games this year, at
press time, W&L has hit 42.4 per
cent of their field goal attempts, the
lowest percentage being 39.7 against
Bridgewater. Away, the Generals
have only a 38.2 percentage, the
worst being 35.7 against R.P.I.

Three and one at home, the team
has outscored its opponents by seven
points a game. On the road, 0-4, they
have been beaten by more than
thirteen points a game.

McHenry noted that the W&L
team is always young. Of five
starters this year, three are soph-
omores, only one a senior. He said,
“A young team always suffers on
the road. We’ve never done well on
the road.”

On the fact that the opposition
has scored more than 87 points a
game in away games, McHenry said
that the team wasn’t able to play a
pressing man-to-man, and that it
would switch to a zone defense.

Bad Years

In 1961-62, when the Generals were
6-11 overall, they lost all eight road
games, and won six of nine home
games. Last year, 5-14 overall, they
were 2-6 both at home and away in
regular season games.

Add those figures to this year,
and Washington and Lee has a
slightly better than .500 (11-10)
record at home. This can be attri-
buted to the enthusiastic and loyal
support given them by student fans.

McHenry noted that King College
is a taller team, but said he would
not be able to scout them. Thus far
this year playing against taller
squads, the Generals nonetheless

have the rebound edge.

He said that this season’s record
on the road was due to a team let-
down. He said, “The whole team is
worse on the road.”

Last year, W&L defeated Bridge-
water and Pennsylvania Military
College away from home. They also
won against Southwestern in the
College Athletic Conference tourna-
ment, but then the site was neutral.

 

W&L To Enter In VMI Relays;
Lord Predicts Good Showing

Fancy Dress weekend holds some-
thing extra for 14 members of the
Washington and Lee winter track
team.

The annual VMI Winter Relay
meet gets underway at 4:30 Saturday
(February 1) at the VMI fieldhouse
with the Generals represented in all
but two events. Only the shot put
and the two mile relay will be with-
out General participants.

The W&L squad has entered four
relay events, with Chris Kell, Rob-
ert Bingham, Bill Jarrett and Gordon
Gay opening the evening at 6:45
in the sprint shuttle event. This re-
lay is composed of four 60-yard
dashes, run alternately.

Co-captain Skip Essex joins Kell,
Bingham and Jarrett in the 880 re-
lay. Essex is also entered in the four
mile relay along with Andy Kilpat-
rick, Riff O’Connor and Charles
Head.

The final General relay event is
the sprint medley, composed of a
440, two 220’s and an 880. W&L has
entered the team of Jarrett, Kell,
Bingham and Essex.

Leading the individual entrants is
another co-captain, Robin Kell. He
is entered in the triple jump, the

first event on the agenda at 4:30,
and the high jump.

Walter Nicklin is the Generals’
representative in the 70-yard high
hurdles, and Chris Kell is entered in
the 60-yard dash.

Other W&L entrants include David
Myers in the broad jump, John Gra-
ham in the pole vault and Brad
Shinkle and John Laimbeer in the
two-mile run.

Track coach Norm Lord is optimis-
tic about the Generals’ chances in
the meet. “The teams are placed in
their relay sections by the size of
the schools. Therefore, we will not
be running in the same heats as
Maryland, Navy, Dike and some of
the other big schools.

“There will be top class competi-
tion there, but I think we will make
a good showing,” he stated.

‘Jocks’ Meet

Stiff Weekend Challenge

By BILLY CANNON

f Washington and Lee’s sport-

|ing teams, the Friday staff of the Ring-tum Phi feels it both
necessary and proper to report on one of the University’s
oldest and certainly greatest teams—the party team.

In accordance with the University’s changing policies, this

 

once nationally renowned team has*

the past few semesters. Academics no
longer make it possible for these
gallant “minks” to schedule events
from Wednesday afternoon to Mon-
day morning. Instead their activities
have been confined to Thursday
through Sunday.

The Party Team, along with its
shortened schedule, has been forced
to restrict its opponents from the
the outstanding teams on the East-
ern seaboard—UNC, Pennsylvania
and Miami University—to less chal-
lenging teams as the University of
Virginia. Fancy Dress has for many
years been the team’s biggest week-
end—you might call it W&L’s win-
ter tournament. This tournament
promises to be no exception.

According to team captain, Steve
“Bear” Walsh, “We'll be shooting
for the ‘moon’.” As the men tighten
their straps, loosen their belts, and
make the annual post-exam jour-
ney to the “Mount,” the exam
cram will cease and the partying
begin. The quiet streets of Lex-
ington will again rise to the oc-
casion as the wettest town per
capita in the country

Some say this great W&lL. tradition
is fading, but the “Bear” contends
that with men like Mike Sheffey,
Hobbie Morrison and Dick Krietler
our team seems to have a solid
backbone. Veteran Brett Thackston,
although he has slowed down some,
can also be counted on to give
a strong performance.

Aside from the stars of old days
the Generals look to be in pretty
good shape with such sophomore
talent as Bobby Culpepper and Tom
Day. The freshman class is not up
to the team’s standards but look to
men like Barney Starr to carry his

able to print the article you are now
reading only by means of liberal
bribes to the personnel in the Uni-
versity Print Shop, men for whom
I still have hope that they will not
be enticed into the web now being
spread by the EC’s spiders.

Crusader Will Fight On

I have high hopes that I will be
able to further expose the EC’s plot
against the student body next week.
If you do not hear from my pen
again, it will mean that I have been
silenced by the student government
authorities—a student martyr to the
search for trustworthiness, loyalty,
helpfulness, friendliness, courteous-
ness, kindness, obedience, cheerful-
ness, thriftiness, bravery, cleanli-
ness, and reverence in student gov-
ernment.

This liquidation would be nothing
unusual, since our poll of exactly
one hundred students reveals that
this has indeed been the fate of
over 66 per cent of them; but it
would be a tragedy for the free
press and its duty of comforting
you the afflicted.

boys will be ready.

Men of the third finger set will
travel into Lexington from as far
away as the University of Texas.
However, one of the oldest and most
respected groups will not make an
appearance. John Clark, in town last
week to promote his group’s new
album, said, “It is with a great deal
of unhappiness that I must announce
that Doug and the Hot Nuts will
not be able to make the scene this
Year. We always loved Fancy Dress
but the Fraternal Order of the Police
will not allow us to come.”

 

Among those groups that will be
in town to celebrate the South’s out-
standing social event will be Martha
and the Vandellas, The Fabulous
Thornton Sisters, Dee Clark, the
Thirteen Sereaming Clowns, Dr.
Feelgood and the Interns and the
old local favorites, the Little Boys.
These stimuli plus the American
Boys’ club and fine looking girls
could provoke W&L’s Party Team
into action.

Man’s World, Says Report

(Continued from page 2)

their bodies with different scents,
and even went so far as to perfume
pet animals.

One thing hasn’t changed much:
early Greek men clung to their
beards as symbols of masculinity and
pitied clean-shaven tribes, imagin-
ing they had been struck by some
disease that turned them into wo-
men. Today’s men bewail shaving as
a nuisance, but Al Anderson, a sales
consultant for Shulton, doesn’t think
they’d give it up if they could. Says
Mr. Anderson:

“In a survey cited by Vance Pack-
ard a few years back, a group of
men were asked this question: sup-
pcse science developed an inexpen-
sive “miracle” cream that in only
three applications would rid you
of your bothersome beard forever.
Would you buy it?

Less than 3 per cent of them
showed the slightest interest; one
man who did said ‘It would be okay
because I have hair on my chest.’”

Psychological Differences
Differences in male-female psy-
chology showed up interestingly on a
multiple-choice word-association test
administered to a test group by psy-

chologists Lewis M. Terman and
Catherine Cox Miles. It was found
that the word “closet” reminded
most male subjects of “door,” most
women of “clothes.” “Charm” tended
to make women think of “beauty”
and men of “snake!” When the word
“home” was mentioned, women
thought sentimentally of “happy,”
men prosaically of “house.”

Which sex is really smarter? In
general intelligence, men and wo-
men seem about equal, according to
those who have studied results of
modern IQ tests. However, more
men than women seem to be found
at either intellectual extreme. More
males fall into the “feeble-minded”
category. But in a survey of ex-
ceptionally gifted children (1Q’s of
132 and over) psychologist Terman
found about 120 boys for every 100
girls that met the minimum re-
quirement.

Women, according to Dr. Justus J.
Schifferes in the Family Medical En-
cyclopedia, are more easily hypno-
tized than men. They are somewhat
more apt to suffer from migraine
headaches. A typical migraine victim,
according to Dr. Schifferes, is a little
woman with fine hair, a smooth
complexion—and perfectionist ten-
dencies! Women are sick about 20
per cent more often than men, yet
at any age, the female death rate
is at least 25 per cent lower than
the male’s!

Is it ever a man’s world? Yes—few
people realize that 105 boys are born
for every 100 girls.

THE BELL TELEPHONE
SALUTE: JESSE YOWELL, JR.

During 1962, The Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Com-
pany of Virginia assigned Jesse Yowell, Jr. (B.S.E.E.,
1959) to the Operating Engineers Training Program at
Bell Labs. On finishing his study there, he’ll return to his
company and the increased opportunities that await him.

Jesse earned this honor by showing what he could do
while a Staff Assistant in the General Engineering Depart-
ment. In that job, he made decisions that involved thou-

sands of dollars. He also established a solid reputation
among company engineers for troubleshooting circuit-
damaging transmission problems such as corrosion.

Jesse Yowell, Jr., like many young engineers, is im-
patient to make things happen for his company and him-
self. There are few places where such restlessness is more
welcomed or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone

business.
