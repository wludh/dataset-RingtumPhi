Scranton Boom Defeats Nixon By 17 Votes

By BILLY CANNON

William Warren Scranton, Gov-
ernor of Pennsylvania, upset former
Vice-President Richard M. Nixon
as Washington and Lee’s choice as a
running mate with Arizona Senator
Barry Goldwater in the 1964 cam-
paign.

Seranton’s selection copped wide
spread enthusiasm from the dele-
gates as he took a 664-647 victory
from the New York lawyer.

Nixon had been nominated by
the “Goldwater-in-64” Chairman
Bill Burke after consultation with
several Goldwater officials who indi-
cated he would be the Senator’s
choice.

“Nixon was the man I was in-
structed to nominate,’ commented
Burke. “However Senator Gold-
water did not express a personal
preference. He said he would be
happy to run with whomever the
Republicans nominated.”

The former vice-president took a
comfortable lead in the late Tues- |
day balloting only to see it dwindle |
as the Washington and Lee delegates |
found favor in bucking the tradi-
tional selection by the Presidential
nominee-elect. Nixon at one point
moved over the required 655 votes
only to have Michigan switch its 48

 

votes on a recall, giving Scranton
the victory.
Governor Scranton
Pennsylvania Chairman Doug Mc-

Dowell accepted the “draft” for
Scranton. The Wealthy Pennsyl-
vanian who hails from the city

named for his family found the
draft nothing new. In fact his en-
tire political career has been marked
by drafts. He has never declared his
candidacy for a political office be-
fore a draft demanding his services
was offered.

He began his political career as a
Congressman from the 10th Con-
gressional District in 1960. His con-
siderable margin of victory in a
democratic area made him a prime
choice for the governorship in 1962.
He was again drafted and defeated
Philadelphia’s Mayor Richard Dil-

worth substantially. This victory
promoted his name to national rec-
ognition.

Scranton is considered a moderate
in most political circles. His major
work in Pennsylvania has _ been
centered around reducing unemploy-
ment which he has done very suc-
cessfully. He is for States’ Rights,
against Medicare, and a proponent
of brinkmanship.

Scranton’s selection was viewed

 

as significant by most political writ-
ers covering the Convention. Most
felt the student’s choice showed wide
spread support for the Pennsylvania
Governor.

Associated Press Correspondent
Bill Johnson commented, “The en-
thusiasm shown for Bill Scranton
could prove significant if the real|
convention moves past Goldwater in
early balloting and selects a com-
promise candidate,

“Scranton is a virtual unknown in
national circles, but by the same
token he hasn’t alienated any voters |
either.”

As far as a running mate with
Goldwater, the reporters felt that
Scranton would be a logical choice
because he could offset the Western-
er’s agricultural appeal with a
Northeast industrial image.

Verified Facts

Senator Goldwater’s first ballot
total of 601 votes surprised most of
the twenty political reporters cov-
ering the Convention, creating spec-
ulation of a possible early ballot
repeat in San Francisco for the
Arizona Senator.

Melville Carrico, one of the state’s
finest journalists in the field, said,
“The first ballot total did seem a

 

little high to me when you consider

Goldwater didn’t receive any of
California’s 86 votes, but the boys
who have been working with the
individual states know a whole lot

more about the national picture

than I do. Your convention proved
significant because it was the coun-
try’s first real

indication of how

 

Scranton supporters begin enthusiastic demonstration.

 

the so-called “pros” view Senator
Goldwater’s strength and how they
will be voting in San Francisco.”

“You might think it’s unrealistic,”
noted Convention State Chairman
Don Partington, “but these individ-
ual chairmen have polled their
states as closely as possible. We
might not pick the Republican nom-
inee; however, if the National Con-
vention were tomorrow, Goldwater
would be nominated.”

It is generally felt across the na-
tion that Senator Goldwater has
strength now to win the nomination
in San Francisco in July because of
the large number of votes already
committed to him. However, two
possibilities loom high in the minds
of Republican leaders.

1. Goldwater must win within the
first two or three ballots if he is to
hold his pledged votes.

2. Goldwater must maintain his
present popularity with vast sections
of the country and must make a re-
spectable showing in the California
primary.

Time seems to be the key to
these two possibilities and only
time will tell if the students of
Washington and Lee have made
their ninth correct choice in 13 at-
tempts.

Hodges Criticizes ‘Playboy’
For Hedonistic Sex Views

Dr. Louis Hodges, Assistan

t Professor of Religion, spoke

Wednesday night on Playboy Philosophy. In the informal talk,
he covered such topics as: Playboy in American Society, Ethical
Principles in Playboy and Playboy on Girls and Sex.

He showed that Playboy Editor, Hugh Hefner, geared his

magazine to the boy who has
who feels that by reading Play-*
boy every month he can learn to
become a “stud.” Dr. Hodges feels
that the magazine served as a spokes-
man rather than the leader in the
present moral trend.

The speaker agreed with many of
Playboy's views, but felt that Hef-

recently become a man, and

 

ner saw too much in terms of black
and white while disregarding the
ambiguity of many important is-
sues. In this manner, he speaks out
on philosophical matters that are
unable to be reduced to such simple
terms as he presents them.

Comparing Playboy with the
Greek Sophists, Dr. Hodges showed
the similarities of belief and pointed
out that the editors are prepared
to release this enlightenment to the
public—for a price.

Dr. Hodges felt that the modern
era has reduced sex to an animal
sort of consumption. The woman
has become no more than an aces-
sory to the male, like a pair of
cuff links. He pointed out that this
attitude is entirely maligned, and
further showed that the woman,
since she was human, should be
treated as human.

Concluding the speech, Dr. Hodges
presented his own views of sex,
saying that sex is not simply an
animal drive for pleasure, it is a part
of the development of the full hu-
man psyche. Man’s giving of him-
self to another is the ultimate ex-
pression of unity and should never
be divorced from love.

Chaffin Calls

Mr. William W. Chaffin, head of
the debate program, stated that this
year more people took part in more
debate tournaments than in recent
Washington and Lee history.

In all, over thirty people partici-
pated in eighteen intercollegiate
tournaments. Besides the eighteen
intercollegiate tournament, Chaffin’s
varsity debaters gave five audience
debates and appeared on one tele-
vision show. In addition, forty to
fifty more students participated in
practice debates.

educational value of debating as

Kendrick Wins
Frosh Award

Bryant Kendrick was elected out-
standing freshman of the class of
’67 by the Interfraternity Council
on Wednesday night.

Kendrick, a Phi Delt from Green-
ville, South Carolina, was appointed
to the Assimilation Committee in
the beginning of the year and was
elected in the last class elections to
a sophomore EC post for next year.

While maintaining a 2.2 grade
point ratio, he captained both the
freshman football and freshman la-
crosse teams. Kendrick has also been
active in the UCA and the Federa-
tion of the Christian Athletes.

In the determining of the honor,
each fraternity submitted the fresh-
man in their house who they thought
was most qualified. The Judicial
Board of the IFC then considered

Debate Season ‘A mazing

at any cost, Mr. Chaffin used pri-
marily sophomores and freshmen.
W&L’s two top debaters of last
year, Bill Noell and Al Eckes, did
not debate this year since Mr. Chaf-
fin wanted to expose others to the
benefits of debate. In the eighteen
tournaments this year, no one per-
son participated in over six.

Considering the inexperience of
the W&L debaters, Mr. Chaffin
termed this year as “an amazing
year.” In debate tournaments,
W&L took four first places, three
second places, and numerous indi-
vidual certificates,

The debaters won two first places
at the Regional Delta Sigma Rho-
Tau Kappa Alpha Tournament. Jack
Eure and Jay Clarke were chosen
the top affirmative debating team of
the tournament. Jay Clarke was
named the tournament’s top speaker
and Eure was named the second best
speaker.

In the Davidson Tournament W&L,
sparked by John McMurry, a soph-
omore, Ed Fitzgerald, a sophomore,
Sam Frazier, a sophomore, and Rick
Kneipper, a junior, posted a record
of ten wins and no losses.

Freshmen continued the winning
ways of the upper classmen. Alan
Cohen won a cup at the Randolph-
Macon Novice Tournament for be-
ing the top affirmative speaker.
Chaffin said that Cohen was the first
freshman debater to make a first
place showing in recent years. An-
other freshman, Bill Grant, won a
certificate at the University of Rich-
mond Novice Tournament in Feb-
ruary.

Washington and Lee debaters
competed in the three top debate

 

tournaments on the east coast—
the Wake Forest Dixie Classic, the

first time W&L has ever partici-
pated in all three of these tourna-
ments in the same year.

In the Georgetown Invitational,

two. In the Dartmouth Invitational,

To Lead SSS

Dick Kreitler, Steve Sweitzer, and
Jack Baber were elected last week
to lead the Student Service Society
next year.

In an interview with the Ring-
tum Phi, president-elect, Kreitler,
stated that he intended to place
great emphasis on creating a SSS
that was more representative of
the University. He pointed out that
in the past the organization has
been composed chiefly of men from
only a few fraternities. It is his
policy to try to break the hegemony
by measuring the applicant by his
qualifications regardless of fraterni-
ty.

Kreitler, a Phi Psi, has been active
in the Commerce Fraternity the 13
Club, and as a fraternity officer.
Next year, along with the SSS, he
will serve as Editor of the Calyx
and President of Fancy Dress.

Stagnation In The EC?

To most students, the Executive Committee seems to be
a fairly stagnate body, performing only the perfunctory tasks
that are assigned to it. Committee appointments, honor trials—
surely these functions are important; however, as a source of
progressive leadership this year’s EC has hardly been vigorous.

Will next year’s EC handle only those duties which have
been performed well by the student government in past years?

Will it exhibit little initiative in

providing essential leadership?

Will the ’64-’65 EC prove to be merely a repeat performance?

Jim Kulp’s program for. next year, outlined at the new
EC's first meeting last night, answers in a very clear negative
to these questions. Kulp presented the program which the EC

will attempt to enact during

points:

e coming year in six major

1. Realizing that the EC is a representative body and wish-
ing to avoid unwarranted criticism resulting from ignorance of
EC procedures, the EC will attempt to bring about better un-
derstanding between the student body and the student govern-
ment through the publication of a schedule of business to be
conducted at future meetings, and of the minutes of past meet-
ings. Futhermore, EC meetings will be open to anyone in the

student body except when the
——

committee goes into executive

2. Kulp urged EC members to voice their opinions in the
mecting in order that the opinions might be discussed and
voted on before publicizing them.

3. Emphasis was placed on the fact that there was no place
for party lines on the EC, either in committee appointments,
inner-EC committees, or honor system trials.

4. An effort will be made next year to better town-Univer-
sity relations. The orderliness of the Mock Convention was cited
as an impetus to attaining the trust and good will of the towns-

—

In order to further support for athletic contests, a
abintan in student rates will be attempted between VMI and
W&L next year. This will increase attendance at both schools’
sports events. Futhermore, townspeople will be encouraged to

support W&L athletics.

6. Because they do play an important role in W&L life,
fraternities will be urged to show what they stand for. They are

more than “drinking clubs’;

; therefore, they should strengthen

their position in the interests ‘of their own preservation.
The emphasis of next year’s EC will be on progressive ini-
tiative. An attempt will be made to transform platform policy

into more than merely campaign promises.
We are convinced of the benefits to be gained through

the effecting of these programs. Therefore, we offer next year’s
EC very sincere support in determining to carry them out.

Mottley Reviews ‘Tom Jones’
Calls It ‘Cinema Masterprece’

By BOB MOTTLEY

Mr. Daves, the manager of the
State Theater, recently reported
with obvious relish that Tom Jones
had done more business in its first
week’s run in Lexington than any
other film that has never appeared
in his establishment, including Gone
With the Wind and Giant, two pre-
vious box office smashes. This being
the case, we are to have Mr. Jones
for a second week, and there should
be general rejoicing.

Masterpiece

Tony Richardson has fashioned a
cinema masterpiece exuding and oc-
casionally reeking bountiful life and
merriment. Tom Jones is a fervent
celebration of what it means to be a
man and a woman; Henry Field-
ing would doubtless be pleased.
Most of the humor is centered in
that hallowed and fashionable area
immediately below the belt, but I
can’t imagine anyone so prudish as
not to be swept away by its execu-
tion. It is good to be reminded that
sex can be fun and that God in His
infinite wisdom made it so—how else
could a man be induced to live with
a woman? We have had quite enough
of contemporary psychologists and
representatives of the Church who
insist on levying the grimmest over-
tones on sex. Tom Jones puts them
all to shame. It also gives a sting-
ing slap at the mores of the Play-
boy crew, who wouldn’t have half
as much fun, trying as they do to
play it cool even in bed.... Perhaps
the highest accolade that may be
laid (no pun intended) on this de-
lightful film is that all of its char-
marvelously human

acters are so
in their virtues and ah—shall we
say—improprieties.

Richardson’s direction is fleet and
crisp; his color photography is the
most splendid and eye-pleasing I
have ever seen in any film. There
are numerous tricks in montage
that occur from time to time, but
the audience is taken into the secret
very quickly and frequently can
only whimper its appreciation, be-
cause these episodes are spaced be-

tween periods of chest-racking guf-
faws. The music gives the film a
Mozart-like aural setting; the large
British cast is uniformly superb. In
short, Tom Jones is an exhilarating

experience; you couldn't take your |}
date to see a better film for enhanc- |

ing a long spring evening....
Rutherford

This is not, of course, to slight the
Lyric, a venerable scene itself of
many pleasurable and few regret-
table evenings. This has been a par-
ticularly delightful week at the arm-
pit. Margaret Rutherford starred in
Murder in the Gallop—and she sur-
prised no one by again proving her-
self (as if she had to!) the most
talented and delightful actress cur-
rently seen before the English-
speaking peoples. This is a whale of
a statement to make, but then Miss
Rutherford is a whale of an actress,
and I retract not one pound of it.

Mr. Side presents through Sat-
urday one of the all-time classics:
Casablanca, a story of intrigue star-
ring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid
Bergman that is still as chilling as
when it was first released.

Hud

And, on Sunday, the Lyric shows
the greatest American Western ever
made, Hud. To be blunt, Hud is
the story of the greatest bastards
going, a whore-mongering, work-
shirking, family-insulting son of the
proverbial bitch superbly portrayed
by Paul Newman. Hud almost cor-
rupts his younger brother, Lon,
played straight by Brandon de
Wilde, but the boy turns to the
sounder ways of his grandfather,
Melvyn Douglas, and the homespun
sense of Alma, the family house-
keeper, played to the hilt by Patricia
Neal. (Neal and Douglas recently
won Oscars for their supporting
roles in this film.)

Hud is uncompromising and hon-
est, but its greatest contribution to
the cinema medium is its black and
white photography by James Wong
Howe, which richly deserved and

Goldwater Nomination Analyzed

 

By ERIC HANSSEN

The nomination of Senator Barry
Morris Goldwater this past Tuesday
seemed to be, in some cases, a large
and surprising disappointment to
many delegates and professionals
alike. Why this man was nominated
with such unexpected speed can
be explained in various ways; how-
ever, the dominating factor seems
to run along the lines of the opin-
ion given by Dr. E. L. Pinney and
several other members of the W&L
political science department after
the Convention had expressed its
preference.

The key industrial states, said Dr.
Pinney, had been necessarily ex-
posed to a factor of indecisiveness
because of the conflict of picking a
candidate that would appeal to the
state’s Republicans and to the

 

switch-over or middle of the road
vote. In other words, it was a
search for an acceptable Republican
who could win in an urban indus-
trial state.

The “Field”

In the search for such a candidate
the Republicans are running into the
problem of having “one candidate
and a ‘field’.” This “field” of can-
didates has no distinct personality
aside from its non-Goldwater char-
acteristics. Thus, in our convention,
and in the nation in general, one
feels the ambiguity of this movement
in its lack of a specific candidate.

“Most of the other votes (i.e., non-
industrial delegations im our con-
vention) were much less exposed to
the essential ambiguity of the cam-
paign, and thus did not split. These
votes followed the path of least re-

 

sistance which was to support the
only really committed candidate—
Barry Goldwater.” Dr. Pinney went
on to point out that the solid Gold-
water states might be compared to
a monolithic bloc while the states
that really seemed to grasp the am-
biguity of the situation were broken
up into various factions.
Monolith

Next the question arises: What is
this monolith and what are its chief
components? It is more than ob-
vious that this movement is a
western conservative one, but is it
more than just this! It is acknowl-
edged by several sources that Gold-
water’s appeal is not geographic as
much as it is strickly ideological.
The Goldwater movement, moreover,
seems to express more of a “feeling”
than a strict doctrine of belief.

Montgomery _—P®t- A vigorous
new party, the
Reform Party, has spontaneously

arisen with a basic platform of op-
position to the clique system. In the
recent elections, almost every major
candidate publically expressed dis-
satisfaction with the cliques. A new
party organization has been founded
with the intent of purging the evils
of the clique system. Finally, one of
the larger fraternities has taken the
heretofore unthinkable step of an-
nouncing its independence from the
system. All of these instances add up
to one thing—a basic dislike for the
clique system and a desire to end it.
Numerous Objections

To the Student Body:

After expressing gratitude to the
eight-man Steering Committee for
the splendid organizational job they
accomplished in making the Mock
Convention the success that it was,
I felt that a further word of thanks
was due all of those members of the
student body who worked on and
participated in the Convention.

The authenticity, enthusiasm and
behavior exhibited at the Conven-
tion could only have resulted from
the cooperation of every member
of the student body. It was one of
the finest displays of student respon-
sibility it has ever been my pleasure
to witness.

EDWARD C. ATWOOD
Dean of Students

Dear Sir:

It would be impossible for me to
congratulate every student person-
ally for the splendid way in which
the 1964 Republican Mock Conven-
tion was conducted. So I take this
method to extend to the student
body my gratitude and congratula-
tions for staging what certainly must
be the most colorful and best organ-
ized Mock Convention ever,

The personal leadership of Chair-

man Phil Sharp was magnificent, as
was the leadership at all levels of
responsibility. No chairman, it seems
to me, has ever been blessed with
such competent and imaginative as-
sistants in conceiving and execut-
ing the plans for the Mock Con-
vention. This high quality of per-
formance was evident throughout
the Steering Committee, the state
delegation chairmen, the campaign
managers, and the many special as-
sistants who contributed so much
time and effort.

It was particularly gratifying to
me to have members of the press
who covered the convention com-
ment on the excellent job being

 

done by Washington and Lee’s stu-
dents. These men often view such
events with an air of detachment,
either real or assumed, and virtually
all managed to betray at one time
or another that they were really
enjoying being here and writing
about the proceedings.

Again, my congratulations, and I
know that many of my assoeiates in
the administration and faculty join
me in thanking the 1964 Mock Con-
vention for a job well done.

Sincerely,

Anti-Clique Feeling Gaining Strength;

democratic. Candidates are picked
by a mere handful of clique repre-
sentatives. Clique meetings are held
in secrecy, and the ridiculously vast
majority of students have no control
over the nomination of their future
leaders. We ordinary students are
simply given a choice between A or
B, like it or lump it.

Futhermore, political bribery and
the necessity for keeping certain
houses in line often leads to the
nomination of inferior candidates, at
the expense of the really qualified
people. No matter how many good
leaders a house may have, it may
run no more than one or two for
office. Two or three houses frequent-
ly dominate a party, at the expense
of the other fraternities.

On the fraternity level, official
house affiliation with a party usually
leads to coercion of votes within the
house. Even if fraternity members
are not told to “vote party,” they
realize that their house will lose
out in the committee appointments
if the party’s candidates are not
elected.

Spoils System

This last fact brings us to the
spoils system. Newly-elected Execu-
tive Committeemen cannot but feel
some obligation to repay their sup-
porters, and qualified men are again
left out of the student government
because they are in the wrong party.
Candidates are chosen, not as indi-
viduals, but as party members.

Finally, the non-fraternity
are left out of the cliques and are
even more voiceless in the selection
of the candidates for whom they are
expected to vote than the fraternity
men. The percentage of independent
students is steadily rising, and this
large group can no longer be ig-
nored,

Ambiguity Splits Big States’ Balloting

This movement could be construed
to be a type of “Know-Nothingism”
which opposes the current adminis-
tration’s actions without actually
bringing forth many workable alter-
natives. “If Wallace can take 31 per
cent of Wisconsin,” said one political
science professor, “it’s obvious that
this ‘Know-Nothingism’ is not a reg-
ional aberration.”

Thus we find Goldwater being
swept along by a tide of dissatis-
faction which is the main factor
accounting for his popularity. It is
necessary to note, however, that
Goldwater did not create this move-

it is going in his direction.

Ambiguity in Search

The ambiguity in the search for
Goldwater’s Republican opponent
seems to be clearing. If our conven-
tion is to be any indication, it would
seem that the man to watch is Gov.
William Scranton, who did surpris-
ingly well for a man who was rela-
tively unknown last September.
(When asked if a Goldwater ticket
could be balanced by such a moder-
ate, Dr. Pinney commented, “it
would take Mao Tse Tung to bal-
ance that ticket.”)

The ambiguity must clear rapidly.
If it does not clear before conven-
tion time, the party may be dealt
a serious blow through factions
fighting among each other. If this
happens it could weaken party unity
to such an extent that Johnson’s
opposition (whoever he might be)
would be opposition in name only.

 

Baur Reviews
Mock Convention

By DREW BAUR
Friday Columnist
The Mock Convention, which
everyone had so long waited for,
has now passed. Its events, some
rather amusing, are worth review-
ing.
The pre-Convention parties began

| Saturday afternoon. The line at the

ABC store stretched out into the
street as preparation began. At
about five o’clock Monday morning
the parties ended and others began.

Finally, after long morning ses-
sions at the Paramount, Doc’s, the
Liquid, and Town Inn a rather quiet
parade started. Although colorful,
the parade would have been some-
what dull had it not been for two
interesting delegations.

The first of these delegations, the
Puerto Rican, began their prepared-
ness in the dying hours of Sunday
night and early hours of Sunday
morning. Not being at home in the
big city atmosphere of Lexington,
they chose the country estate of the
last Indian in Virginia to plot their
parade program. Unquestionably, the
gift to Mr. Judd was one of the
parade’s highlights.

At about the same time in the
heart of the Lexington metropolitan
area, the CroFaunJo delegation held
their meeting. After some discussion,
the clique decided to nominate Ed
Side for president. Surprise was of
the essence for this tweedy band
as they headed for the parade
grounds. Placed on the periphery of
the grounds, this group quietly re-
mained totally unnoticed until the
parade actually began. The enthus-
iasm and surprise of the crowd was
unmatched by anything ever before
seen in Lexington.

Unfortunately, Mr. Side ran into
the same problem that Adlai Steven-
son had at the Democratic Conven-
tion of 1960, namely that his over-
whelming popular support was not
shared by the party bosses. His lib-
eral platform met with no sympa-
thy from the conservative party
bosses, and thus the people’s choice
was forced to the sidelines. After
the convention had ended though,
even the party bosses began to see
their mistake and admitted that
Side would have just as much chance
as Goldwater of defeating Lyndon
Johnson,

CONVENTION SIDELIGHTS

Things to remember during the
convention were: Bing Crosby
Greene’s solo of the Oregon national
anthem; Delaware passing in favor
of Connecticut on the initial role
call; the effective Stop Barry move-
ment; a few subtleties with Miss
America; the Idaho float; Miss Tex-
as; and the return of several dis-
tinguished alumni of the Georgia
delegation.

Best Bets For The Weekend:
Giants to continue on winning
streak, Cleveland to slump, goodies
at Greenbrier, the carny skin show,
and Fun in the Sun Rum.

CAC Tourney Opens Today

Washington Favored to Repeat;
Generals Pin Hopes on Tennis

By GUY UNANGST
Friday Sports Editor
Five colleges will compete today and tomorrow in Danville,
Ky., for the Presidents’ Trophy, a 300-pound locomotive bell
emblematic of College Athletic Conference supremacy.
The event is the second annual Spring Sports Festival of
the CAC. The trophy goes to the general conference cham-
pion, computed on conference standings in football, basketball

and four spring sports—golf, tennis,*

baseball and track.

Last year’s champion, Washington
University in St. Louis, will be de-
fending the trophy against Wash-
ington and Lee, Southwestern, Se-
wanee and host school Centre.

Sewanee now leads the trophy
quest, with 35 points picked up in
football and basketball. Washington,
Southwestern and Centre have 30,
Washington and Lee 25. Points are
awarded on a 25-20-15-10-5 basis in
each sport.

Washington is favored to repeat
its championships in track and base-
ball, Southwestern to win again in
golf. The Generals are favorites in
tennis.

Teams Leave Yesterday

W&L’s track, baseball and tennis
teams left early yesterday morning
for play beginning this morning.

 

"LM WEEK

gS
“WITH ONLY THE first playoff
games completed by Wednesday,
Delt looked like a good bet to re-
peat as softball champ.

The Delts, who whipped past all
opposition in their league, opened
the playoffs with a 6-4 victory
over ZBT.

In the other opening playoff game,
Beta, who surprised most people by
taking their league’s title, outslug-
ged PiKA for an 8-6 decision.

Playoff activity continued yester-
day.

BETA WAS the only real surprise
to enter the tournament. The Betas
finished the regular season in a tie
with SPE, both having identical 3-1
records.

SPE was expected to take the
title since they had beaten Beta
20-12 in their opening match, but
Beta took their second game by
a 5-3 margin,

PiKA also had a close call before
taking their league’s title. Aifter
DU had whipped SAE 4-3, both
clubs had identical 3-0 records. The
teams were as evenly matched as
their records indicated, with PiKA
pulling out a 3-2 victory and earn-
ing the right to advance to the play-
offs.

Better Sports News

 

The golf squad left Wednesday in
order to play a practice round on
Danville Country Club’s course.

Last night the five schools attended
a dinner in their honor, after which
drawings were made to determine
pairings in tennis and baseball.

In baseball, the four visiting
schools will meet each other in the
opening round. Host school Centre
automatically gets a first round bye
(a fact which last year allowed the
tournament, to finish ahead of
Southwestern, at 2-1.)

Tennis is conducted as a series of
tournaments, one in each of six
singles and three doubles ranks.
Each includes championship and
consolation brackets, points being
awarded to champion and runner-
up in each bracket.

The golf champion is determined
in 36 holes of medal play, in which

 

CERI

Oe

each school enters four men, the
winner determined by the teams’
aggregate scores.

Track and field is run under of-
ficial NCAA rules.

Best Chance—Tennis

W&L’s best chance to win a sport
is in tennis, where the Generals fin-
ished third last year, behind Wash-
ington and Sewanee.

The same team will be playing
again this year, taking a 10-3 record
into the tournament. Its last regular
season match, against Virginia, was
rained out.

 

The Battle for the Bell

Randy Jones will again play num-
ber one. He has won eight of 12
singles matches this year. Jim De-
Young and John Baker are both
back in shape, and will play num-
bers two and three.

Jim Mell, Lindsey Short and For-
rest Dickinson round out the six
man squad Coach Bill Washburn
will take.

The baseball team will be hard
pressed to do as well as last year’s
second place finish, although it
soundly defeated Lynchburg 13-3
Wednesday, in its last regular sea-
son game.

 

To Pay Towson Tomorrow

The Washington and Lee lacrosse
team which has been riding high
for most of the season, unexpectedly
fell to Loyola of Baltimore yester-
day, 10-7.

‘Loyola jumped off to a quick 3-0
lead in the first quarter and never
fell behind, although the Generals
once tied the score 5-5 in the third
quarter.

 

 

Loyola midfielder John Stewart
(second team All-America last year)
was outstanding against the Gener-

als, scoring three goals and two
assists.
The Marylanders’ goalie, Tony

Federico, also played an excellent
game. He was credited with 14
saves.

General goalie Pete Noonan made

 

23 saves as Loyola outshot the Gen-
erals 54-35.

Attackman Carrol Klingelhofer
and midfielder John McDaniel led
the General effort. Klingelhofer had
one goal and three assists. McDaniel
scored three times.

Also in the scoring column for
W&L were Mike Michaeles with one
goal and two assists, Randy Wootton
and Bob Frost, each with one score,
and Pat Robertson, who made an
assist.

Robertson, a second midfielder,
also led the the team in recovering
ground balls. He picked up 10. The
Generals led Loyola in that depart-
ment 57-47.

W&L coach Bob McHenry said
that the team, “made a fine physical
effort but not a coordinated, intel-
ligent one.” He also said he hopes
the team can bounce back strongly
against Towson tomorrow.

CAC Begins Today In Danville

Last year W&L hosted the tourna-
ment and, with two seconds and two
thirds, finished second to the Bears
in overall point totals 110-105. This
year, without the advantage of the
home field, it will be a bit more dif-
ficult.

CAC

The CAC, designed to stimulate
intercollegiate participation “solely
because of interest in and the en-
joyment of the game,’ went into
operation September, 1962.

Centre, Southwestern, Sewanee
and W&L were charter members.
Washington joined shortly after it
was formed. Each school maintains

program.

pose. While purporting to end the
“big clique,” the Liberty Party es-
tablishes one. Though it has an-
nounced that its “sole intent” is to
present us with “the best qualified
and most capable” men, the Liberty
Party presumes that all of these
men are members of its bare major-
ity group.

What, then, is the answer? One
very good one has been advanced.
We could continue to have two par-
ties, but each house and the N.F.U.
could be represented in each party.
Each party would have 19 delega-
tions in it, and no fraternity would
be officially connected to a party.
As in our national system, individ-
uals, not voting-blocks, would be
the party members.

There are great benefits to be de-
rived from such a system. The ma-
chinery for nomination of candidates
would be preserved intact, without
