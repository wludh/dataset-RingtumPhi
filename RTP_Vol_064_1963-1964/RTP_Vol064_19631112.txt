- ‘20 A. M. --- - And Not A Parking Space In a - - - See Editorial Below

 

It is a sad thing that money
does not grow on trees, and
a sadder thing in the eyes of
the journalism department that
the Ring-tum Phi publishes
editorial comments on page
one—but today we feel that
we have a problem worthy of
front page billing. And, it
might be solved with a fairly
minimal expense to the school.
The picture above serves in the
place of any words we might
use to describe the parking
situation here at W&L—it is

deplorable.
A Definite Need

Of course many students are in
a position of being able to walk to
school without any strain—and per-
haps some students who presently
drive would do better to stretch their
legs ocassionally. But above and be-
yond the matter of physical degen-
eration of American youth due to too
much reliance on the automobile, we
have a situation which needs a so-
lution—and we think we have one.

At the right is a drawing of the
land below the Episcopal church and
the school, which fronts on Jefferson
Street. There are two parking lots
on this property—the so-called “Phi
Kap” parking lot, and the Univer-
sity parking area across from Red
Square. We propose that these two
lots be joined, and that the “Phi
Kap” lot be extended to cover
field which is now between it and
the corner of Washington Street and
Jefferson Street. Further, we pro-
pose that once this additional land
is cleared, that the whole mess be
covered with asphalt, and that park-
ing lines be painted in.

 

PLACEMENT NOTICE

Mr .Claude W. Rodgers of Arthur
Andersen & Co. will be on our cam-
pus Thursday, November 14 to inter-
view juniors and seniors interested
in professional employment oppor-
tunities in income taxation offered
by this international firm of ac-
countants and auditors. The company
has offices in the principal cities of
the United States, as well as over-
seas offices in many countries. Un-
dergraduate courses in accounting
are desired, but an accounting major
is not required.

Appointments for interviews must
be made in advance in the Placement
Office, Washington 25

FAST SERVICE

Effective Tuesday a.m. November
12, the east serving line will be
used as “a quick service line” for
those late risers or those desiring
only pastry, juice, fruit, and coffee.
Your food service committee agrees
with the dining hall management
that this arrangement will be ad-
vantageous,

The reason? Inconsiderate drivers
often use two parking spaces, the
lot in front of the school is used
by tourists quite frequently, and in
the winter, it is impossible to clear
the snow off the two present lots
because there is nothing but mud
and loose gravel below the snow.
Cars often get trapped in the snow
and mud, causing even more con-
fusion.

 

ahead with this proposal would take
away from the University’s landscape
as it is seen from Jefferson Street.
If the necessary money could be
raised, however, perhaps a hedge or
boxwood could be planted between
the Jefferson Street sidewalk and
the asphalt parking lot, thus hiding
the lot from the street.
A Long-Standing Problem
There has been a great deal of

over the past few years—and it is
a problem which The Ring-tum Phi
has discussed for almost ten years.
We understand that the Building and
Grounds Office has some plans under
consideration.

one, but we would hope that some-
thing definite could be done within

By DAVID MARCHESE
Tuesday Staff Writer

Note to the reader: the material
used in today’s article was taken
from an interview with Ralph El-

lison in the Paris Review, reprinted

in Interviews of Writers at Work,
published by Viking Press, New
York.

Born in Oklahoma City on March
1, 1914, Mr. Ellison attended Tus-
kegee Institute 1933-1936 where he
was a music major. After a summer
in New York studying sculpture he
abandoned his music studies for
writing and participation in the New
York City Writer’s Project.

Rosenwald Fellow

In 1945, he received a Rosenwald
Fellowship which permitted him to
begin work on his celebrated novel,
Invisible Man, which won the Na-
tional Book Award of 1952.

In 1955, Ellison was awarded the
Prix de Rome Fellowship by the
American Accademy of Arts and Let-
ters. Previously, he had lectured
at the Salzburg, Austra, Seminar in
American Studies. From 1957 to
1961 he was Visiting Lecturer
Literature at Bard College and two
years ago served as the Alexander
White Visiting Professor at the
University of Chicago.

| lison

Mr. Ellison is currently a Board
member of the Institute of Jazz
Studies. Since his childhood, he has
worked as a newsboy, dental assist-
ant, receptionist, jazz trumpeter,
lecturer on literature, and
professional photographer. His prin-
cipal hobby is experimental audio-

electronics.
The interview was. concerned,
among other subjects, with a few

of his ideas involving social protest,
Negro provincialism and “univer-
sality in literature” with its debt to
Negro folklore.

When asked to what degree the
highly regarded theory of social
realism influenced his writing, El-
singled out Malraux as one of
his influences. He considers him
more of a human
Marxian writers and he considers
Malraux to be the artist-revolution-
ary rather than the politician after
writing Man’s Fate.

Art, Not Injustice

He realizes that Malraux’s con-
cern for the tragie struggle of hu-
manity is unlike that of the other
social realists who were concerned
less with tragedy tha nwith injus-
tice. Ellison goes so far as to say
that he, himself, is concerned not
with injustice but with art.

cooperation with 26 professors,

have been named participants in this year’s Robert E. Lee Re-
search program. The professors with their student assistants
are working on 49 research projects, a marked increase over

*the number of projects undertaken
last year.

The Robert E. Lee Research Fund
was established in the fall of 1960
through a gift of more than a quar-
ter of a million dollars by the
late Dr. Gustavus Benz Capito, an
alumnus of the Class of 1899. Funds
are available to encourage well qual-
ified and strongly motivated stu-
dents, while still undergraduates, to
become familiar with research tools,
techniques, and methodology.

The experience is supposed to
broaden the participants’ knowledge
and understanding of how research
and original investigation are con-
ducted. If a student plans to pursue
graduate work, it provides him with
an early introduction to the kind of
research activities usually encoun-
tered for the first time at the gradu-
ate level.

Largest of Its Kind
The program is believed to be the
largest of its kind in U.S. colleges
and universities.

Projects are chiefly of two types:
the assisting of a professor in his
research, or the carrying out of a
plan of research of the undergradu-
ate under the supervision of a pro-
fessor.

A student may be nominated for
a grant by a professor with whom he
is studying. Grant recipients are
known as Robert E. Lee Research
Assistants, those who have and
maintain B averages are designated
Robert E. Lee Research Scholars.
Participation carries no academic
credit, but the grants enable a stu-
dent to earn a portion of the cost
of his education in work that has
unusual educational significance.

The professors and students and
their projects are as follows:

Debate Project

Mr. William W. Chaffin has six
students working under him. They
are Peter Straub, and Edward Fitz-
gerald whose project is “Research
and Assistance in the Debate Pro-
gram”; John Clark and Alfred

Some Praise, And A Reminder

The faculty cut proposal, adopted last week after it
was presented by the Faculty Committee on Courses and
Degrees, is a move which should come close to solving
many of the problems about which both faculty members
and students have been complaining in recent years. Two-
thirds of a year was spent considering a revision of our
present cut system, and in the past few months, a special
faculty committee, under the direction of Professor Wil-
liam M. Hinton, has been drawing up the specific pro-
posal which was published last week in this edition.

A great deal of credit for the proposal belongs to
Professor Hinton’s committee, which was composed of a
vast cross-section of faculty members who represented
every possible view on cutting. On this committee were
young members of the faculty, senior members, professors
who favor unlimited cuts for everyone, and professors
who lean toward a more strict cut system. The work
which they did to make the wording and the contents of
the proposal practical and acceptable deserves the highest
commendation.

Many other faculty members participated in the
formulation of the proposal. Professor Hinton’s commit-
tee was quite painstaking in questioning as many other
members of the faculty as possible so that they might be
able to draw up a truly representative plan. Had they not
done this, it is likely that they would not have met with
such immediate success as they did last Monday. The pro-
posal was in final form at that time, and the questions
which might have come up about it had already been
considered.

Students should note that the penalty for overcutting
under the new system is an automatic “F” for only one
overcut—not two, as in the past three years. It is felt
that since most students will be allowed many more cuts
they will want to take (or should be able to take in a prac-
tical sense), that there should be no instances of over-
cutting. When the automatic “F” for overcutting rule
was instituted in 1960, it was thought that no students
would violate it simply because it is such a severe penalty.
It is hoped that students will take especial note of this rule
under the new cut system, and by using some personal
responsibility prevent the Executive Committee of the
Faculty from having to deal with such an unpleasant
penalty.

Perhaps it is idealistic, but we think it would be a good
idea for all students to be thinking between now and
February about what the purpose of taking a cut really is.
Too often, to be sure, the purpose turns out to be an
extra hour and a half of sleep (especially when the class
is at 8:25), or an earlier start on that road trip. We cannot
eliminate these causes—but the most valid causes would
seem to be needed study time for another class, a pressing
personal problem, or complications with some extra-curri-
cular activity which demands one’s attention during class
hours.

The only real solution seems to be a resolution on the
part of professors to make their lectures an important
enough part of their class so that a student would be
committing academic suicide to cut their class too often.
On the other hand, it is a rather narrow-minded procedure
to dock a student’s grade for excessive cutting if that
particular student is performing capably on his quizzes.

A Clarification

We would like to make it clear that Negro author
Ralph Ellison has been invited to this campus by Profes-
sor Severn Duvall, Chairman of the English Department,
because Mr. Ellison is a distinguished novelist and be-
cause he happened to be in this region and available for
a speaking engagement at this particular time.

 

Gentlemen, May We Present...

Today the Tuesday Editon Features the Executive
Committee of the Student Body. The gallery should be
fairly obvious to the right. The purpose of publishing
individual pictures of each committee member and some
facts about his record is to familiarize all students (and
faculty) with exactly which men on campus make up
this powerful group.

Often a student will go through four years at W&L
without ever knowing the names of more than three or
four of the EC members. Often a student will find him-
self accused of an honor violation and brought before
this committee for a hearing, and see few, if any, familiar
faces. And so we hope that all students will take a close
look at this committee, and at the records of each member.
We intend to make a few remarks in the next few issues
which should do even more to bring the EC down to a
common ground,

In today’s issue, due to lack of space, we have printed
information about only eight of the twelve EC members.
Next week we shall complete the study with members
Bowie, Kulp, Madison, and Rowe.

Diversity and Scholastic Excellence

By Barry Vaught, Staff Reporter

The following information has been gathered in order to
offer students an easy means by which they can become familiar
with the Executive Committee of the Student body. This is the
first of a series of articles which will explore the nature and the
powers of the Executive Committee in depth. The purpose
of this first number is simply to let students know exactly who
is on the EC, and some vital statistics about each man.

Professor and Student Comment on Negro Author

Ring-tum Phi
Lexington, Virgiina
Dear Sirs:

I certainly wonder along with Mr.
DeJarnette what the intentions are
of the men who invited Novelist
Ellison to W&L. It will be quite
interesting to have on campus a man
who might not be in complete agree-
ment with us, a man who sits on the
other side of the fence.

But then, those writers, those men
who sit on the other side of the
fence, often raise the most astonish-
ing questions, and gosh, I get all
embarrassed.

I hope, as Mr. DeJarnette does,
that Mr. Ellison will “confine him-
self” to “things academic,” because—
well—those current topics are just
more than I can bear—just bringing
them up rubs a sore spot, and
gosh—I’m awfully tender.

Perhaps I ought not to go to Mr.
Ellison’s lecture after all. I guess
I should just retreat a little further
into my shell that night—AGAIN.

Sincerely,

John Samet

Dear Sirs:

In the Friday’s Ring-tum Phi
there appeared a letter by Mr.
Jack DeJarnette which stuck me as
so clear and sensible, that I wish
to praise the author and expand
a little upon his theme.

Mr. DeJarnette suspects that the
coming of Ralph Ellison to speak
here, November 15, on “The Novel
and the American Experience,” is a
move similar to those taken by the
trustees of Sweet Briar and Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman’s College. He
says:

Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege is trying, despite the ef-
forts of its many loyal alumnae,
to get its Board of Trustees to per-

mit it to accept a Negro applicant.

In this paragraph his implied def-
inition of loyalty to a school is un-
questionably correct: it means noth-
ing but opposition to integration,
while considerations of moral re-
sponsibility, money-drawing power
and educational enrichment are of no
concern, Certainly there are some
alumnae of this nationally famous
woman’s college who favor integra-
tion; they are disloyal by definition.
Admirable semantics!

All future discussions of this
problem will be indebted to Mr.
DeJarnette for another phrase he
has invented. He calls the two
woman's colleges “a bit extreme
when compared to that of [sic|

 

 
    
  
 

time.

Henry Fonda on “That Was the Week that Was”:
“Statistics show that 19 out of every 20 babies born in the
United States are legitimate. This means that your opinion
| of your fellow man is correct only one-twentieth of the

 
  
  

Washington and Lee.” “A bit ex-
treme” works like the pharse
“somewhat massacred” and sug-
gests a whole range of phrases to
describe one’s gradual approach to
any awful prospect: “somewhat
massacred,’ “more massacred,”
and to invoke Shakespeare, “most
massacredest.” Mr. DeJarnette and
I agree that in racial problems no
action is ever anything than “a
bit extreme.”

With as much wit as intelligence,
Mr. DeJarnette continues to chal-
lenge the invitation to Ellison:
“...why not invite a qualified
Chinese, Japanese, or Arab to appear
here?” Who would not rather go
to hear a native of China, Japan, or
Saudi Arabia speak on “The Novel
and the American Experience” in
preference to an American novelist?
The idea is so charming it might
be extended to other fields. For ex-
ample Barry Goldwater might speak
on “The Nature of the Bismuth
Atom,” or Christine Keeler on
“Chasity as a Way of Life.”

Well, says Mr. DeJarnette, if we

Henry played one of his finest

Three long fourth-quarter runs by a trio of Sewanee backs

Before the Generals could find
themselves again, M. L. Agnew—
Sewanee’s leading ground-gainer
and scorer—had galloped around end
for 39 yards and another Tiger tally.
The Washington and Lee forward

The first period was scoreless but the Baby Generals gained a one to
nothing half-time lead when Jim Cogar scored from close range. Claude
Rogers was given the assist. The same duo combined for the other W&L
goal. With 5:40 left in the game Cogar scored from close range on a long

loose on the first play of the fourth period for a touchdown to start the
ball rolling for their third victory of the year, a 14-6 triumph over Ran-
dolph-Macon Academy Saturday.

fense.

the Brigaders came back well
and mid-semester exams to control the

well-executed offensive maneuver.

Berthelsen and Henry are running
away with the scoring honors for the
team thus far. Berthelsen has scored
eight goals and four assists, while
Henry now has five goals and five
assists. Between them they have
accounted for one-half of the team’s
goals and almost one half of the

Tuesday the Generals visit Univer-
sity of Virginia, the defending State
Champions, in the final game before
the State Tournament. A _ victory
could give the Generals the mo-
mentum to go on to the State Cham-
pionship. The prediction from the
records of participants would be
W&L for third place. W&L has lost
to Lynchburg and is not expected
to beat the Cavaliers today, but the
team seems confident that it can
handle Lynchburg in a rematch. The
game today will tell the tale of the
Generals’ chances against Virginia.
Their success in the tournament is
dependent on the offense, which has
been inconsistent thus far. The de-
fense has been consistently excel-
lent all season with Green, Redmond,
Pete Preston, and Howard Busse do-
ing their jobs in fine style. Bruce
Jackson and Wes Horner also saved
Green a lot of trouble by keeping
the ball away from shooting range.

first touchdown came on a one-yard
run by John Bogart with a full-
back plunge.

The drive started 13 plays earlier
from the W&L 40, with Bogart car-
rying nine times.

After the kickoff to the Randolph-
Macon eleven resulted in a punting
situation three downs later, Phil
Thompson put a hard rush on the
punter and tackled him before he
got a chance to boot. The Brigade
took over on the R-M A 35 and got

rolling with some fine play from!

Bogart, Johnny Grahara and quart-
erback Bryant Kendrick.

Phil Claxton took the ball over
from the one and the extra point
made it 14-0.

R-M A received the kick and on
their first play from scrimmage a
counter netted 70 yards and their
lone TD.

Coach Swan plans to emphasize de-
fense for the Hargrave game com-
ing up this week. It is the Briga-
dier’s finale, and if they win, they
will have a 4-2 mark.

The pep band will be on hand,
and it is hoped most of the freshman
class.

W&L was succesful at taking the
baby ‘Jackets outside game, and
stoping their passing.

In the State cros-country meet

a quite respectable showing, gar-

The Indian’s power duo of John-

second by a shade, with Old Domin-

and fourth respectively.

With the season closing this week
against Fairmont College, the Gen-

record to 6-1, a fine mark.

must have Ellison, let him speak on
a “purely academic” basis. Again
we are indebted to Mr. DeJarenette
for clarifying an important concept:
what is the “purely academic”?—Mr.
Ellison, you are a teacher of Eng-
lish, and we would like to hear you
divulge the date of the Magna
Charta; or give short plot summaries
of Shapespeare’s plays; or, and this
is a bit extreme, recite the Burns’
poem called, “A man’s a man for a’
that.” But how can any topic which
assumes a connection between art
and life be purely academic? No,
“academic” in the purest sense
denies all connections; so you must
change your topic.

Mr. DeJarnette “cannot help
wondering whether or not HE is
coming for purely academic pur-
poses, no matter what the inten-
tions are of those who invited
him to appear here.” I admit that
the author commits an indiscre-
tion by referring to Ellison with
bold-face caps when custom dic-
tates a more pious use of such
typography. (A not unfair assump-
tion is that the type-setter is in
cahoots with the “who” who in-
vited Ellison).

But the logic of Mr. DeJarnette’s
insinuation is as clear as it is con-
vincing: Ellison is undoubtedly
coming with intentions to demon-
strate the connection between art

and life viewed above as strictly un-
academic, the province of rabble-
rousers, propagandists, crusaders,
money-raisers and other frauds. The
issue is clear: Mr. DeJarnette and I
believe that only those whose lec-
tures completely disregard contem-
porary thought, events and move-
ments ought to be dignified with the
opportunity to address the academy.
This doctrine might well guide the
selection of lecture material in the
Commerce School and the Journal-
ism Department as well as lead
the Religion Department to recon-
sider its invitation to Dr. Samuel E.
Stumpf. He is to talk here, Novem-
ber 12 and 13, on “The Moral Order
and the Legal Order.” Excusible
only if the “orders” his title refers
to were in effect long ago and far
away.

American higher education is to-
day faced with unusual challenges.
One of them, a most extreme one,
is the threat of outsiders like Mar-
tin Luther King, Ralph Ellison, Rus-
sell Kirk, and the Governors Wallace
and Barnette who invade the halls of
ivy with their nasty unacademic
purposes. Confused by these men
(nearly once every two years), how
can a college student “improve his
ability to think—deliberately, crit-
ically, and analytically ...develop
develop new powers of reasoning
that enables him to arrive at sound,
defensible conclusions”? Washing-
ton and Lee Bulletin, 1963-4, p. 15).
If we continue to invite lectures
like Ellison, the University will be
stained with the “discredit or dis-
honor” of caring about contempor-
ary life. If we stop this practice
now, we may all—you and I and Mr.
DeJarnette—join in to sing about
college friendships some day soon
as the ivy slowly creeps past the
last remaining crust of red brick.

(Author of “Rally Round the Flag, Boys!”
and “Barefoot Boy With Cheek.”’)

SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE he
AND JAZZ LIKE THAT a

T am now an elderly gentleman, full of years and aches, but
my thoughts keep ever turning to my undergraduate days. This
is called “arrested development.”

But I cannot stop the healing tide of nostalgia that washes
over me as I recall those golden campus days, those ivy-covered
buildings (actually, at my college, there was only ivy: no bricks),
those pulse-tingling lectures on John Dryden and Cotton
Mather, the many friends I made, the many deans I bit.

I know some of you are already dreading the day when you
graduate and lose touch with all your merry classmates. It is
my pleasant task today to assure you that it need not be so;
all you have to do is join the Alumni Association and every year
you will receive a bright, newsy, chatty bulletin, chock-full of

tidings about your old buddies.

Oh, what a red-letter day it is at my house, the day the
Alumni Bulletin arrives! I cancel all my engagements, take the
phone off the hook, dismiss my resident osteopath, put the
cheetah outside, and settle down for an evening of pure pleasure
with the Bulletin and (need I add?) a good supply of Marlboro

Cigarettes.

 

 

 

 

 

Whenever I am having fun, a Marlboro makes the fun even
more fun. That filter, that flavor, that yielding soft pack, that
firm Flip Top box, never fails to heighten my pleasure whether
I am playing Double Canfield or watching the radio or knitting
an afghan or enjoying any other diverting pursuit you might
name—except, of course, spear fishing. But then, how much
spear fishing does one do in Clovis, New Mexico, where I live?

But I digress. Let us return to my Alumni Bulletin and the
fascinating news about my old friends and classmates. I quote

frem the current issue:

“Well, fellow alums, it certainly has been a wing-dinger of a
year for us old grads! Remember Mildred Cheddar and Harry
Camembert, those crazy kids who always held hands in Econ II?
Well, they’re married now and living in Clovis, New Mexico,
where Harry rents spear-fishing equipment, and Mildred has just
given birth to a lovely 28-pound daughter, her second in four
months. Nice going, Mildred and Harry!

“Remember Jethro Brie, the man we voted most likely to
succeed? Well, old Jethro is still gathering laurels! Last week
he was voted ‘Motorman of the Year’ by his fellow workers in

the Duluth streetcar system.

‘T owe it all to my brakeman,’

said Jethro in a characteristically modest acceptance speech,

Same old Jethre!

“Probably the most glamorous time had by any of us old
alums was had by Francis Macomber last year. He went on a
big game hunting safari all the way to Africa! We received many
interesting post cards from Francis until he was, alas, acci-
dentally shot and killed by his wife and white hunter. Tough

luck, Francis!

“Wilametta ‘Deadeye’ Macomber, widow of the late beloved
Francis Macomber, was married yesterday to Fred ‘Sureshot’
Sigafoos, white hunter, in a simple double-ring ceremony in
Nairobi. Many happy returns, Wilametta and Fred!

“Well, alums, that just about wraps it up for this year.

Buy bends!”

Old grads, new grads, undergrads, and non-grads all agree:
