FACULTY ADOPTS NEW CUT PROPOSAL

‘Biedermann’ Premieres Tomorrow - 8:15

Dols, Mrs. Dickens Star
In Trcub Comic Allegory

By STEVE

COLVIN

Wednesday is opening night for the Troubadour Theatre’s
1963-64 Season. The first production will feature a comedy,

Biedermann and the Firebugs, b

y Swiss playwright Max Frisch.

Read by German classes at W&L last year, The Firebugs is a
comic allegory depicting a cowardly, rich, upper middle class

Everyman and his apathy toward*
and disbelief of the evil which
threatens to destroy him.

Tim Dols, a senior, appearing for
the first time on the Troub stage, will
play the title role of Gottlieb Bied-
ermann, Playing his wife Babette
Biedermann, is Mrs. Yvonne Dick-
ens, wife of David B. Dickens, Pro-
fessor of German. This couple un-
wittingly falls prey to the evil plans
of two arsonists who openly divulge
their intentions to burn down Bied-
ermann’s house.

Colvin, Volpe Play Bugs

Steve Colvin and Joe Volpe will
play the roles of the two arsonists.
In an allegorical sense, their parts
represent the two faces of evil:
diplomatic and the brutal. Working
as a team, they completely delude
Biedermann and turn his selfish
concern for security into a weapon
for his own destruction. Most re-
markably, they camouflage their in-
tentions to burn the town down by
simply telling the truth.

This play has been seen by many
as a warning against the menace of
Communism which, in plain print in
The Communist Manifesto, declares
not only its intention to engulf the
world, but also outlines its methods
and, theoretically, at least, does
everything “by the book.” Likewise,
Communism employs the threat of
naked force with the wisdom of
diplomacy to accomplish its aims, as
do the two firebugs.

Theatre-Oriented Play

Another aspect of this play is
the return to “open theatricality.”
This merely means that the audience
is kept constantly aware that they
are in a theatre and not sitting as
omniscent observers of real people
doing real things. Dr. Cecil Jones,
director of this production, has
added to the author’s ideas in this
direction with ideas of his own. It
is likely that the audience will be
a bit surprised to find vestiges of a
“Greek Chorus” dressed as fire-
men, and rooms without visible
walls or doors.

Included in this category is the
use of simultaneous settings side by
side of a living room and an attic, the
indication of night by the lowering
of a crescent moon, occasional ele-
ments on stage, which appear out of

Tonight At 8:15
In duPont Aud.

By HOWARD EPSTEIN
Staff Reporter

The origins of the Courtly Ro-
mances will be discussed tonight as
Dr. U. T. Holmes, Kenan professor
cf romance philology at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina speaks in
the duPont Auditorium.

The lecture, “French Romances as
an Early Novelistic Form,” will be-
gin at 8:15. It is the first of the 1963-
64 Seminar in Literature lectures,
and the 46th of the series initiated
in the early 1950's.

Dr. Holmes, an eminent Mediev-
alist, is an authority on the French
literature of the 12th century. In-
cluded in this period are such leg-
ends as King Arthur and Perceval
and the Holy Grail, which have
formed a basis for early literature.
The legends of this period affect not
only the development of French lit-
erature, but also greatly influence
English literature.

A member of the UNC faculty
since 1925 and a full professor there
since 1927, Dr. Holmes was named
Kenan professor at North Carolina
in 1945. He taught at the University
of Missouri from 1923 to 1925. He
received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
from Harvard University.

Dr. Holmes, a former Fulbright
lecturer at the University of Mel-
bourne in Australia, has served as a
visiting lecturer in four different
American universities. He was made
a Chevalier de la Legion d’Honneur
by the French government in 1950
and served as president of the South
Atlantic Modern Language Associa-
tion in 1941.

He is co-editor of the Works of
DuBartas, and with A. H. Schintz
he published the History of the
French Language. He also is the
author of History of Old French Lit-
erature and Daily Living in the
Twelfth Century, editor of Volume
I of the Critical Bibliography of
French Literature, managing editor
of Romance Notes, a UNC publica-
tion.

To Remain

In Effect Until February

By TRACY HARRINGTON
Tuesday Managing Editor
The faculty Monday afternoon approved a greatly liberal-
ized cut system, to go into effect next semester.
Modification of the present system, under study by faculty

months, resulted in the new
*absence regulations policy. Accord-
ing to Dean W. W. Pusey, the pres-
ent system will continue to operate
through this semester.

The main feature of the new
cut system is an increase of cuts for
upperclassmen in the 1.0 to 1.5
bracket, and 1.5 to 2.0 category.
Dean’s List students (2.0 for upper-
classmen, 2.5 for freshmen) keep
unlimited cuts under the new sys-
tem.

Freshman Rules Liberalized

First semester freshmen will be
allowed as many absences in each
course as there are class meetings
of the course per week, and second
semester freshmen will be given as
many cuts per course as there are
class meetings in a week if he makes
.60 or above first semester. Second
semester freshmen with 2.5 first se-
mester grade point ratios or above
will be given unlimiteds.

Overcutting Penalty

Since the new absence regulations
permit more cutting, the policy re-
garding overcuts has been restricted.
Whereas under the present system a
student is dropped from a course
upon the second overcut, he will be
dropped with a grade of F for one
overcut.

The body of the new cut system
passed by the faculty is as follows:

I, Absences in the following cate-
gories are free from administrative
penalties; all others are considered
unexcused and are subject to pre-
scribed penalties.

A. 1. Illness requiring a physician’s
care.

2. Participation in authorized Uni-
versity activities.

3. Absences caused by emergen-
cies, which are excused in advance
by the Dean of Students or in his
absence, by the appropriate academic
dean.

B. A student on the Dean’s List
is permitted to determine his own
class attendance.

..(The following three points—C,
D, and E—apply only to upperclass-

men. See G and H below for fresh-
men regulations),

Ellison’s ‘Invisible Man’ A Powerful First Novel

 

Ralph Ellison, Invisible Man. (Signet, $.75), 503 pages.

By ROGER PAINE
Note: This summary of Ellison’s Invisible Man is a
compilation of critical material which has been written
about the novel. Although many students may not
have time to read the book for themselves, it is hoped
that the following data will make it possible for a
greater number of the W&L community to appreciate
Ellison’s visit to this campus November 15. (See news
story).

Ralph Ellison is the powerful Negro author from
whom James Baldwin learned his lessons about writ-
ing. Ellison’s first novel, Invisible Man, won a Na-
tional Book Award. He begins it with a Prologue.

“I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like
those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of
your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of
substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids—and I
might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible,
understand, simply because people refuse to see me.”

The story begins with its Negro protagonist be-
low ground in the basement of a building in a strict
white-rent district. He lives in the glare of 1,369 light
bulbs, whose current is supplied from the tapped line
of Monoplated Light and Power.

Ellison’s protagonist considers himself an invisible
man simply because no one will pay any attention to

him—he can walk down the street, and people pre-
tend that he is not there, that he is not a human being
as they are, An incident which rises out of others’
attitude toward him is described on the second page
of the novel, and is a typical example of the powerful
writing which persists throught its 500 pages:

“One night I accidentally bumped into a man, and
perhaps because of the near darkness he saw me and
called me an insulting name. I sprang at him, seized
his coat lapels and demanded that he apologize. He was
a tall blond man, and as my face came close to his he
looked insolently out of his blue eyes and cursed me,
his breath hot in my face as he struggled. I pulled his
chin down sharp upon the crown of my head, butting
him is I had seen the West Indians do, and I felt his
flesh tear and the blood gush out, and I yelled, ‘Apol-
ogize! Apologize!’ But he continued to curse and strug-
gle, and I butted him again and again until he went
down heavily, on his knees, profusely bleeding. I
kicked him repeatedly, in a frenzy because he still
uttered insults though his lips were frothy with blood.
Oh yes, I kicked him! And in my outrage I get out my
knife and prepared to slit his throat, right there be-
neath the lamplight in the deserted street, holding him
by the collar with one hand, and opening the knife
with my teeth—when it occurred to me that the man
had not seen me, actually; that he, as far as he knew,
was in the midst of a walking nightmare! And I stop-

ped the blade, slicing the air as I pushed him away,
letting him fall back to the street,”

This incident occurs after the protagonist has lived
through the events that are told in the rest of the
novel. The story really is concerned with showing
the reader how the Negro comes to such a state, and
how he realizes that the whites would like to consider
him an invisible being.

In the first section of the novel, the protagonist
goes to a colored college in the South. Through two
highly dramatic and violent scenes, Ellison explains the
attitude of the white South toward the Negro. In one
instance a Negro sharecropper named Trueblood is
visited. He has had an incestuous relationship with
his daughter. Because of this, he is treated as a celebri-
ty by the white people in the community. His infamy
gains him material benefits from the whites which
his hard work had never won,

Trueblood is a freak and a “typical nigger” in the
eyes of the whites, and so they build him up. True-
bloods reaction is full of irony:

“The nigguhs up at the school come down to chase
me off and that made me mad. I went to see the white
folks then and they gave me help. That’s what I don’t
understand, I done the worse thing a man could ever
do in his family and instead of chasin’ me out of the
country, they gimme more help than they ever give
any other colored man, no matter how good a nigguh

he was. Except that my wife an’ daughter won’t speak
to me, I'm better off than I ever been before. And
even if Kate won’t speak to me she took the new
clothes I bought her from up in town and now she’s
gettin’ some eyeglasses made what she been needin’
for so long, But what I don’t understand is how I done
the worse thing a man can do in his own family and
stead of things gittin’ bad, they got better. The nigguhs

up at school don’t like me, but the white folks treats
me fine.”

Later in the novel, a Negro who is a former surgeon
comes into the plot—he had been a brain surgeon, and
while in France, had performed several operations of
note. Nostalgia brought him back to the states, but he
had forgotten about the southern white bigots. The
doctor explains what happened to him:

“I returned to save a life and I was refused,” he
said. “Ten men in masks drove me out from the city
at midnight and beat me with whips for saving a hu-
man life. I was forced to the utmost degradation be-
cause I possessed skilled hands and the belief that
my knowledge could bring me dignity—not wealth,
only dignity—and other men health!” This incident,
which is Trueblood in reverse, shows how the white
South rewards genuine accomplishment.

Later, through a sermon delivered by a

Literature And Politics

We call special attention to the literature and politics
columns of this edition, published weekly on this page.
Today we are featuring in the “‘Current Literature in Re-
view” section some poetry written by students and col-
lected by Special Features Editor Bert Phillips.

Because we believe that student creative talent should
have a medium through which it can be heard, and because
we feel that The Ring-tum Phi can offer a place (if not
an entirely adequate one) for such talent, we encourage
any students who have written in the past or who have now
started to write, to submit their work to editor Phillips.

In the future, the “Current Literature in Review” sec-
tion will present critical reviews of such writers as Ayn
Rand, Lawrence Durrell, Truman Capote, and John Up-
dike, as well as broader studies of selected literary figures
of the first half of the twentieth century such as Faulkner,
Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Cozzens.

Last week, the ‘Political Horizons” column was key-
noted by an explication of the liberal philosophy. Today
the same thing is done for the conservative philosophy.
This column will be published weekly throughout the
school year, presenting one week the liberal view and
the next week the conservative view, and centring on
specific issues.

We found it interesting to note that the two philoso-
phies, when set down on paper, seem to strike very sim-
ilar notes. Last week Tracy Harrington wrote that liberal-
ism “wishes to make possible for all individuals and groups
to have the opportunity to exercise their powers, so far
as this can be done without injury to others,” and that
liberalism believes that ‘the source of all progress lies in
the free exercise of individual energy.”

Today, Bill Braithwaite and Wyatt Durrette write,
concerning conservatism that it believes “that social struc-
ture is best which places upon the individual the oppor-
tunity and responsibility of shaping his own destinity; that
political structure is best which does for the individual
only what he cannot do for himself; that economic struc-
ture is best which allows maximum freedom in the utiliza-
tion of private property to satisfy material desires.”

In coming weeks, ‘Political Horizons” will be brought
down to more concrete issues, more definite explanation
of terms, and we hope, will help members of the student
body to understand more fully the ramifications of specific
national political issues leading up to the mock conven-
tion next spring.

Ellison’s Planned Visit

The lecture in Lee Chapel scheduled for November
15 will be a first for Washington and Lee. It will be a first
because Ralph Ellison is the first Negro speaker to be suc-
cessfully invited to come to this campus. From the stand-
point of his reputation, a better man to be the first of his
race as a speaker here could not have been chosen.

 

Ellison is a very distinguished writer, having won
with his first novel, Invisible Man, a National Book
Award. He helped James Baldwin get his start in writ-
ing. Ellison’s personal experiences, judging by his writing,
seems to be very great.

In this issue we have published a lengthy review of
Invisible Man. We wish to make it clear that this review is
inadequate in that it covers only a small part of the actual
plot of the novel. There are several lengthy quotes from
the book which, we have inserted into the review because
it is impossible to understand the force of Ellison’s prose
without going directly to it.

Extensive critical material on Invisible Man, is avail-
able in the library for interested students, and we encour-
age those who wish to hear Ellison’s lecture to familiarize
themselves with the overall content of his work. It is an
excellent novel, powerfully composed, and sensitively

felt.

Current Cinema

Past and Present Cinema
A Fallacy in Film Review

By TOM PACE

The age-old problem of youth is that we (you and I being youth-
ful) have not experienced the good old days. You know—when
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Bobby Jones, Jack Dempsey, and Gene Tunney
were the idols of our parents’ generation. I have thought for some
time that most likely, Mantle, Mays, Palmer, Nicklaus, Marciano,
Liston, and dozens of other athletes of our time are doubtless super-
ior to the athletes of forty years ago.

Until recently however, I had simply accepted that this premise
did not apply to films. I listened somewhat reverently to our elders
when they said that movies just aren’t what they used to be for
indeed these people had had the good fortune to see films both
then and now. But now I am convinced that they are wrong, and
that it takes little perception to illustrate that fact.

Whenever lists of the greatest films of all time are made up, the
lists always include many more films of thirty and forty years ago
than they do of more recent films. And surprisingly nearly all the
respected critics abide by this principle, i.e., “this film is the best
of its kind since . ...”

The Lonely Death

And though his heart did pound,

He primed his gun and fixed his gaze;
“They would not have this ground.”

He fired six rounds and others too,
Did prime and fire and die.

He fired six more and still it came;
That line of grey: but why?

Why was it that he had been sent,
To this bare place to kill,

To kill those whom two months before,
He would have helped when ill?

Was it because their Abe had said,
“Both Black and White must be
Free to find those things which God
Had planned for man to see?”

And while he thought of this and more,
The grey line still came on.

Again he fired, and beside him fell,
The best friend he had known.

Once more the question came to him?
“Why had his friend to die?”
One Black only he had known.

This one’s name was Sy.

Sy was drunk near half the time,
And he was the biggest lout.
Surely his kind was not enough

To fight a war about.

And still he searched his soul.

times as many absences in each
course as there are class meetings
of the course per week and if he
has a cumulative 1.0 on all work
attempted and if he has earned a
grade-point ratio of 1.5 with no
grade below a C on his preceding
semester report.

D. A student is permitted twice
as many absences in each course as
there are class meetings of the
course per week if he has a cumula-
tive .6 at the end of his freshman
year, .7 at the end of his sophomore
year, and 9 at the end of his junior
year, and if he has earned a grade-
point ratio of 1.0 on his preceding
semester report.

E. A student not on academic pro-
bation but failing to meet the stand-
ards above is permitted as many ab-
sences in each course as there are
class meetings of the course per
week.

F. A student on academic proba-
tion is permitted two absences in
each course if he did not exceed
the limit permitted him in any
course the preceding semester. One
absence per course is permitted in
any event.

G. A first-semester freshman is
permitted as many absences in each
course as there are class meetings
of the course per week.

H. A second semester freshman is

permitted as many absences in each
course as there are class meetings
of the course per week if he has
achieved a grade-point ratio of 6
on the work of the preceding semes-
ter. Only one cut in each course is
permitted if his grade-point ratio
is below 6.

Il. If the instructor concerned
considers that absences have con-
tributed materially to unsatisfactory
work on the part of any student in
‘tthe above categories, he may request
the appropriate dean to revoke the
student’s absence privileges in that
class. Any absences thereafter will
be considered unexcused.

Ill. Unexcused absences are sub-
ject to the following penalties. If a
student has one unexcused absence
beyond the number permitted his
eategory in I or II above, he shall
be dropped from that course with
an F. (Subject to appeal to the
Albsence Committee.)

IV. The classification of transfer

students for absence regulation pur-
poses shall be determined by the ap-
propriate committee at the time of
admission.
V. Absences before and after any
holiday are limited to Dean’s List
students or those on mid-semester
or semester Honor Roll.

The section in the University Cat-
alogue beginning “Any student...”

(P. 108), remains the same, with

the exception that reinstatement may
be made only on conditions to be
determined by the Absence Commit-
tee of the Faculty.

The portion of the new proposal
dealing with probation (catalogue,
page 105) is as follows:

1. Academic Probation—A student
is placed on academic probation if
he is re-instated after falling under
the Automatic Rule. A student on
academic probation is permitted two
absences in each course if he did not
exceed the limit permitted him in
any course during the preceding
semester. One absence per course is
permitted in any event. A student
on academic probation is not per-
mitted to own, control, or operate a
motor vehicle in or around Lexing-
ton. He may be required to withdraw
from the University at any time that
his academic work is unsatisfactory.

The sections in the catalogue deal-
ing with absence probation and final
absence probation are to be elimi-
nated.

While the new cut system was
given across the board aproval at
yesterday’s faculty meeting, Dean
Pusey indicated that “experience
may lead to modification” of any or
part of the proposed system.

While the body of the new regu-
lations have been finalized, the pre-
cise wording as it will appear in the
catalogue may be changed.

 

Political Horizons

 

Property, Tradition and Opportunity
Foundations of Conservative Doctrine

By WILLIAM BRAITHWAITE and
WYATT B. DURETTE, JR.
We emphasize at the beginning
that this is not an attempt to deli-
neate “the conservative movement”—
but only a setting forth of our view
of responsible philosophical conser-
vatism. As this philosophy—and it
is so, not just a political credo—places
primary and final importance on the
individual qua individual, neces-
sarily there will be divergent views.
We feel, however, there is a defi-
nite, albeit general, philosophical
framework within which these views
may be consistently incorporated.
To begin: we believe that God, in
creating Man, gave him the right to
life, and necessarily therefore, also
the right to those things required
for life—namely, food and shelter,
which Man acquires through the use
of property.
Initial Importance on Individual
We believe that initial importance
in any social, political or economic
structure should be placed upon
the individual; therefore, we con-
clude that society exists for the

individual, not the individual for
society. (That this latter notion
leads to many mischevious conclu-
sions we will show in later columns.)

Upon this reasoning that social
structure is best which places upon
the individual the opportunity and
responsibility of shaping his own
destiny; that political structure is
best which does for the individual
only what he cannot do for him-
self; that economic structure is best
which allows maximum freedom in
the utilization of private property
to satisfy material desires. (We de-
fine the “maximum” as that point
where one man’s freedom infringes
upon another’s.)

Tradition a Guide

We believe that history, or more
particularly, tradition, furnishes de-
pendable if not final indication which
political and economic systems best
attain these ends: specifically, a con-
stitutional republican form of gov-
ernment, and a private property,
capitalistic economy.

Tradition we view as the culmi-
nation of generations of reason and

experience, and therefore we believe
it is a valuable source of prescrip-
tive knowledge. Neither to be fol-
lowed blindly nor discarded in emo-
tional haste for change, it is rather
to be studied, prudently, in an effort
to preserve that which is wise and
relinquish that which has proved
unwise.

Freedom vs. Not-Freedom

Extending our views beyond na-
tional borders, we contend that the
world conflict today is most accur-
ately assessed as a conflict between
freedom and not-freedom—a conflict
between those seeking freedom not
only for themselves but also for
others, and those who deny freedom
to each and all.

We contend that since the United
States is the de facto leader of
those nations which represent free-
dom in varying, humanly imperfect
ways, the preservation and extension
of freedom depends upon the deter-
mination of the American people,
with whom lies the largest propor-
tion of the moral, physical and finan-
cial burdens of the struggle.

By ADDISON BROCKENBROUGH 4

Thursday, October 31 ?

I was playing a fast game of hand-
ball in the gym today when I ran
into or rather, was run into, by
Coach Dunderbrawn. He was try-
ing to get out to the gym floor to
put his boys through their paces.
When he got through with them,
he started talking to me about the
poor physical condition of most W&L
men.

“They come here from years of
football and other such _ beneficial
activities, and then let themselves
go to pot,” he said. “If it weren't
for this compulsory P.E. class, they
would turn into vegetables.”

I asked him if he thought the
P.E. program really kept anyone
in shape. He said it probably didn’t.
“But that’s their fault—not ours.
I’ve seen boys do what they called
ten push-ups without ever pushing
their body off the floor.”

Coach Dunderbrawn continued:
“Last week I got a good example of
the attitude the boys take toward
this class—they hate it, you know.
Most of them will do anything they
can to get out of P.E. As I was say-
ing, last week a boy broke his wrist
in a class and now he is trying to
tell us that he should be excused
from classes. Lots of football players
have gone through a whole game
with worse injuries.”

I have heard that the P.E. de-
partment is rather insistent about
people with injuries taking their
courses, but at times there seems to
be a mistake in their logic.

Friday, November 1

I have a date this weekend who
says that she likes people who are
different—who aren’t afraid “to be
themselves.” While walking down
the colonnade this morning, I real-
ized that there are quite a few indi-
vidualists around here—and it’s quite
easy to spot them, because they all

minister at his college, the protagon-
is learns of the irony of the southern
Negro college. Its purpose is not to
enlighten, but to indoctrinate with a
myth. The minister says that the
colored race is a humble but fast-
rising people, and that they need
only adopt the white’s success for-
mula, At the close of the sermon,
the protagonist realizes that the min-
ister is blind.

Invisible Man is full of symbo-
lism, and one striking scene occurs
with the protagonist, now in New
York City, working for the Liberty
Paint Company. The company puts
him to work on a batch of paint
which is to be used on a national
monument—he must measure ten
drops of black liquid into each
bucket of “Optic White” paint, and
then stir the mixture until the
black becomes invisible. Inadvert-
ently the youth gets a refill of what
he thinks is the prescribed black
liquid from the wrong tank, and
thus dopes the white paint with
concentrated remover, making vis-
ible the black liquid within the
white.

In later experiences, the protag-
onist becomes mixed up in mass
movements, and discovers that in
working for the “Brotherhood” tc
further the cause of his race, he
is just as invisible as before, be-
cause the Brotherhood is willing tc
sacrifice the individual for the over-
all drive toward acceptance of the
race.

The novel ends with a race riot
in which most of the major conflict:
are resolved. In running from the
scene of the riot, the protagonis
meets a gang of white hoodlum:
armed with baseball bats. He jump:
into an open manhole, landings
finally in a coal cellar, where hi
can enjoy the safety of his invisi-
bility.

Washington and Lee scored once
in every quarter Saturday while
playing stiff defensive football and
downed Franklin and Marshall Col-
lege, 28-6, before a F&M Parents’
Day crowd of 4,000.

The Generals piled up 359 offensive |

Sackett, with 158 rushing yards and}
a 7.5 average for the game, and Stu |

 

Yoffe, who scored ten points for |

a team high of 34, were outstanding
W&L players as the Generals tallied
21 first downs to F&M’s 10.
Fullback, Dan Manson, highlighted
the initial Washington and Lee drive
with a 41-yard run which carried
the pigskin to the Diplomats’ 28.

Soccer Team Edges American TE 2-1; 3

Kilpatrick Tops Bradford In Tennis

BY TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

American University is well known for the large number
of foreigners in its student body. Only eight of 1257 students
at Washington and Lee are from foreign countries. Yet the
General’s soccer team beat American at its own game, the use

of foreigners on the team. *

The Great Dane, Preben Berthel- |
sen, led the Generals to a 2 to 1
conquest of the Eagles at American
Saturday. Berthelsen set up the
first W&L score to tie the game and
then scored the decisive goal.

The first half of the match was
scoreless, mainly because of the
fine play of the W&L halfbacks
and GideonGadebeku , the center
halfback for American, who hails
from Nigeria. Tom Green and the
Bagle goalie had an easy time for
first 44 minutes.

American scored first with 15 min-
utes remaining in the third quarter
when Schwartz took a pass from
Celtnieks and booted it into the
nets. But the hosts were destined
to score no more.

The winners tied it with 1:30 left
in the period on Chris Clarke’s goal.
Berthelsen got the winning goal
with 6 minutes left in the game on
what may be described as an ideal
play that was executed with perfec-
tion. Passes from Tim Henry to

Steve Hibbard to Berthelsen gave

him the easy shot to wrap up the
victory.
W&L controlled the ball through-

With another fine team effort, the
W&L harriers edged past American
University, 26-34, Saturday on the

«| Washington course.

The home team captured the first
two places, but W&L easily took the
next four sports. Sophomore Rif
O’Connor led the Generals, followed
closely by senior Charlie Head, with
his best time of the year, junior
Andy Kilpatrick, and freshman Bill
Wildrick. American captured the
next place, but W&L sophomores
Ed Wood and Lee Johnson took the
next two.

Times for the Generals were pret-
ty good considering the cold, dry

’ windy day and that the A.U. course

is about a mile shorter than the
W&L course.

Coach Miller was especially hap-

 

py with the team performance,
pointing out that oly 26 seconds
separated our first five men. He felt
that the A.U. course was a good one
with many similarities to our own.

Short Course

Captain Kilpatrick felt that the
team was hurt by the shortness of
the course and would have done bet-
ter on our own course. He was very
pleased with the team showing so
far this year (they are 5-1) and em-
phasized that the Generals are a
young team.

The harriers will be working very
hard this week in preparation for
the State meet in Richmond on Sat-
urday. Tough competition will be
seen from VMI, W&M, and Old Do-
minion (the only team to beat the
Generals). On the next Saturday,
W&L faces Fairmont in the final
meet of the year.

For example, last year when|
“Days of Wine and Roses” was re-|
leased, Time referred to it as the|
finest film on alcoholism since “Lost |
Weekend.” Well, Sunday night 1|
saw “Lost Weekend” and despite the |
fact that it mentioned Time maga- |
zine twice, and even dropped Henry
Luce’s name, it was a terrible movie.
Whereas the one, “Days,” was a
cemi-successful film, the other
“Weekend,’ was a sermonish and

absoluately no room for comparison.

Another example might be the
two versions of “A Star Is Born.”
The more recent 1954 version has
James Mason’s excellent perfor-
mance, Judy Garland’s singing, and
an almost honestly moving finale.
The original of the thirties is noth-
ing more than brutal testimony of
the sentimental crap that movie-
goers of that decade apparently ate
up.

made (and still is) by critics every-
where. Ridiculous. Though certain
elements in its make-up allow that
it is a fine movie, it is nonetheless
chock full of faults—melodrama,
poor acting, poor lines and a mean-
ing-destroying ending. It cannot
compare to the truly brilliant films
of the last several years.

Kurosawa’s treatment of ‘“Rash-
omon” was not nearly as cinematic
as are the treatments of “Jules and
Jim,” “Hiroshima Mon Amour,” or
“81,,” to mention only the finest
films of Truffant, Resnais, and Fel-
lini. After the first forty minutes,
“Rashomon” became a stolid, limited,
often boring film, which was much |
more literary than it was cinematic. |

The cinema is still a new art
form. Past examples are being re-
fined and improved upon. Directors
today have the advantage of the
teaching of the early models, and
the real artists of the cinema have
learned. (Much the same as James
and Tolstoy were able to learn
from the two centuries of novelists
who preceded them.)

Though there is certainly a lot of
trash released at present, this can-
not alter the fact that the great
films of the last few years are really
the best films ever made.

Ellison’s Novel Has ‘Power’

BE FREE OF ILLUSION...” And
| in this state, the protagonist feels he
is invisible no longer. Awakening
from his dream, however, he knows
that he will stay underground, in
glare of his 1,369 light bulbs, trying
to “think things out in peace.”

Invisibility in the novel is a sym-
bol for the loss of self, and the
overriding theme is that color de-
prives the Negro of his individuali-
ty. Yet, as is also implicit in the
story, all men have been deprived
of their individuality by the ma-
chine age. Ellison’s story is an af-
firmation of the worth and dignity
of the individual in the face of forces
which conspire to render him in-
visible.

Ellison balances his novel on a
line between comedy and tragedy.
The comedy is, however, a laughter-
to-keep-from-crying. The novel has
a broad sweep. going from revival
meeting to funeral sermon to gradu-
ation address to the numbers racket,
the boxing ring, the ball park, the
bar room, Harlem. The dialogue is
full of spicy jive talk and occasional
Biblical phrases. Symbolism is im-
portant—some of it overt—with a
scene, for instance, of a bartender
slicing off the white heads on the
beers he has just poured.

The style is both tight and loose—
there is not a detail wasted, and yet
many of the sentences run on in
Faulknerian style. Jazz and the blues
play an important part in the sym-
bolic elements of the story. It is
impossible to outline the entire book | *
in any depth—but it is a novel well
worth reading and it is a story which
moves quickly. It should be on
everyone's reading list, above and
beyond the fact that its author will
be here on campus November 15.
