Campaign managers for the seven
major GOP hopefuls were an-
nounced today by the Steering Com-
mittee of Washington and Lee’s Mock
Convention.

They are Bill Burke, Senator
Goldwater; Steve Hibbard, Gover-
nor Rockefeller; Jack Yarbrough,
Richard Nixon; Jud Reis, Governor
Romney; George Craddock, Margaret
Chase Smith; Doug McDowell, Gov-
ernor Scranton; and Walter Bennett,
Henry Cabot Lodge.

The student campaign managers
will be campus contacts for the na-
tional headquarters of each of the
candidates, and will make sure that
each of the possibilities comes fully
to the attention of the student body.
Convention chairman Phil Sharp
pointed out that the presidential
candidates may take more than usual
interest in the W&L convention as
an indicator, due to the muddled
situation in the upcoming primaries.

The W&L convention, Sharp said,
will be especially significant as a
prediction because the large number
of candidates entering the primaries
will prevent their being decisive
tests.

In an interview with the Friday
Ring-tum Phi the new campaign
managers discussed the chances of
their candidates to be picked as

W&L’s choice for the eventual nom-
ination by the GOP.

Burke Claims Lead

‘From all indications we have
excellent support from the student
body and throughout the country,”
commented Burke, speaking of Sen.
Goldwater’s campaign. “In a_ poll
taken last week, Goldwater con-
trolled 82 per cent of the GOP lead-
ers.”

Burke is chairman of the Arizona
delegation to the Mock Convention.
The campaign committee under his
direction gives every indication that
the Arizona Senator will receive
the same enthusiastic support in
Lexington which he has obtained all
over the country. Burke said that
two floats have been planned. One
will carry posters and statues of
the Senator; the other will be full
of girls, one of whom may be Gold-
water’s daughter, Peggy.

Burke, who has talked with Gold-
water twice already, said he plans
to go to Washington next week to
speak further with the leading can-
didate.

On the committee controlling
Goldwater’s campaign in Lexington
are John Heinzerling, Art Broadus,
Bob Henley, Jere Cravens, Jim
Culp, Leyburn Mosby and J. D.
Humphries.

 

“We can expect to carry the South
and most of the West. However, Cal-
ifornia is the key state in the race.
At the moment its delegation
votes are split between Goldwater
Rockefeller and Nixon. With a vic-
tory here we will carry the North-
west.”

Hibbard Booms Rocky

Steve Hibbard agreed, but believes
the New York Governor’s chances
“are equal now and will get better.”

“He is far from being overshadow-
ed, as evident by the greater recep-
tion he received from the USS.
Chamber of Commerce last week
when he addressed that body.” Gold-
water had spoken to the group a
week earlier.

“We're in constant touch with the
Rockefeller Headquarters and I plan
to speak with the Governor in the
next few weeks. We would like to
have him down for the convention
but everything depends on his cam-
paign schedule.”

Brice Gamber is the Vice-chair-
man of the Rockefeller-for-President
committee and he is being assisted
by Dick Krietler.

The third key figure in the vital
California race is former Vice-Pres-
ident Richard Nixon. His campaign
manager, Jack Yarbough, was not
available for comment.

Will Confer With Scranton.

Another often-mentioned
date Pennsylvania’s Governor
Seranton. However, Doug McDowell,
his local manager and chairman of
the Pennsylvania delegation to the
convention, said
he is not an announced candidate,
but has said he would

given no official support to his cam-
paign, but this has not discouraged

same informal manner which has
characterized his candidate.

“Senator Smith threw her petti-
coat into the ring a little over two
weeks ago and pledged herself to
a campaign based on her previous
record, without the use of buttons
stickers, posters, etc. One real asset
I see in her is a woman’s ability
to haggle at a Summit conference.
Even a cool man like Mr. K. will be
swayed by her tears.”

An Unjust Attack

We congratulate the Tuesday Edition’s unpopular and
hence courageous stand on integration, but at the same time
would like to correct some misgivings which it presented in
its editorial. First of all, it was entirely unfair in its charge
that the W&L Admissions Committee ‘must skip over any
high school students (however qualified) whose skin is dark.”
The truth of the matter is that no Negro has ever submitted
a completed application for admission to this University. (A
Negro student did begin the process of applying to W&L|_
at one time, but did not go through with his application, and the |ff
Admissions Office heard nothing else of him.) Thus, theoret- |j
ically at least, we have no evidence that W&L is a segregated

institution.
Secondly, we question why

to W&L. If he should matriculate at the University, more
than likely there would be no serious repercussions within the
student body or faculty. However, the Negro himself would
find the going tough. For example, he could scarcely expect
to find any favorable degree of social acceptance. Because of
the restrictive clauses of many of the national fraternities, he
would be unable to rush the majority of houses; needless to
say his dating life would be severely limited; he would have

difficulty in establishing many

outside the academic sphere would be extremely restrictive and

ungratifying.

What would happen if a Negro should apply? Dean At-
wood states that in all probability the application of a Negro
student would be duly processed by the Office of Admissions,
and if the student were academically qualified, the case would
be referred to President Cole or the Board of Trustees. But
as it stands now, there is no reason to believe that any qualified

applicant would be turned away

a Negro would want to apply |!

Filet Mignon In

The annual freshman griping about the food in the Com-
mons has been conspicuous by its absence. Of late there has
been an unusual scarcity of complaints about the fare served
up by the W&L Slater System. Why? The answer is a dual
one: a new administration in the Commons, and the effective
functioning of a student ““Food Committee.”

Since the arrival in December of William Albright as man-
ager of the Commons, there has been a very noticeable im-
provement in the quality of the food, the care given to its
preparation, and the willingness of the staff to please the diners.
Perhaps most important is the novel availability of all the milk
you can drink. Another gesture was Mr. Albright’s opening
the dining hall nightly during exam period to serve free coffee.
And in the pre-Albert days, what was so rare as a hot roll? It

is almost unbelievable that a

make so much difference; we hope the improvement will con-

tinue.

Mr. Albright has been kept

complaints by a four-man committee headed by dorm counselor
Bob Henley. The Food Committee, formed last year as a sop
to freshman rioting, has been meeting regularly and has worked
very well to initiate needed changes in food and service.

The end result is that the freshmen can still be counted on
to throw food on occasion; but the quality of the food being
thrown is much better, and there is less (if any) cause to

throw it.

‘Ivy Revolutionaries’ Stage Protest

By DREW BAUR

Under the ominous shadow of a
hill, the Ivy Camouflaged Revolu-
tionaries held their
first meeting of
the year. Mr. Ivy
had called this
special meeting
beeause they had
run out of revolt-
ing topics and
needed new ma-
terial. He opened
the meeting with
the prologue to
Mein Kampf.

Following the
invocation, Racy Ivy was the first
to speak. He was a_ professional
rebel who had been frustrated in
the power struggle involving the
building of a drinking fountain in
the Liberty Hall Library. Now he
had hit upon a sensational thought—

him to rise up and shoot his mother
because she was obviously biased
to white-eyed children. Having
spoken, Racy took his seat, dreamily
thinking of bloodshot eyes and the
large amount of parking space be-
hind the gym.

Chosen to second his proposal was
the mysterious Addison Ivy. Addie,
as he was affectionately called by his
fellow Friars, had been thwarted by
a strong central government which
had obviously been malicious and
unmerciful in all of its actions. Ad-
dison mentioned that, although he
was not quite sure why he objected
to motherhood, Racy’s words were
good enough for him,

Mr. Ivy wholeheartedly agreed
with the suggestion and decided that
motherhood was a prejudiced organ-
ization which should be suppressed.
He ended the meeting by leading
his subsidized revolters in the un-

 

constitutional school prayer.

One of the most explosive issues
in our society since the impact of
World War II has'|
been the pub-
lication of the fa-
mous “Kinsey re-
ports.” An exten-
sive study by Dr.
Alfred Kinsey and
his associates of
the Institute for
Sex Research at
Indiana Universi-
ty, this two-vol-
ume research rep-
resented quite an
eye-opener on American sexual be-
havior.
Among the more shocking discov-
eries of the Kinsey team were that
85 per cent of the total male popu-
lation had had premarital inter-
course; an estimated 50 per cent

of married males had had extra-

Sexual Revolution—Part I

 

marital intercourse; some 70 per cent
of males had had relations with pros-
titutes.

In addition, the survey revealed
that 64 per cent of the female popu-
lation had “responded to orgasm by
one means or another prior to mar-
riage;” 45 per cent had had premari-
tal intercourse; among college gradu-
ates, the number of wives who ad-
mitted to extramarital intercourse
was 29 per cent.

The publication of these statistics
in 1953 merely authenticated what
many observers had already de-
tected in our society’s undercur-
rents, that is, we were experienc-
ing a critical transition later to be
labelled the “Sexual Revolution.”
Partly due to the impact of the
War, partly to the growing skep-
ticism of liberalized education, we
have over the past two decades
very decidedly dispelled the Puri-
tanical hangover that so long has
pervaded the American outlook.
Traditional Christian morality has
been deemed unrealistic, totally
out of tune with the facts of hu-
man behavior. In its place is the
more liberal philosophy that each
person first know himself, and only
on the basis of this self-awareness
can he validly set up rules of per-
sonal conduct.

In this modern search for man as
he really is, it is found that one of
the most powerful of human desires
is, indeed, the sex desire. Under its
influence, men developed keenness of
imagination, courage, persistence,
and creative ability, unknown
to them at other times. Under its
influence, civilizations have risen to
great heights of achievement.

 

Throughout Western history, for ex-

ample, those societies which have
offered the strongest enlightenment,
the most advanced cultures, have
fostered sexual activity as one of its
basic activating stimuli. This gener-
alization is true with Egypt, Babylo-
nia, Greece, Rome, Renaissance Italy,
and Romantic England. On the other
hand, those societies in which sex-
ual behavior has been subject to
extreme repression have been mark-
ed by striking cultural sterility. Ex-
amples of the latter are Medieval
Europe and Victorian England.
Since the sex urge exerts such a
powerful infiuence over individual
and social activities its undue repres-
sion can conversely deprive us of
any full realization of our creative
potential. It is understandable, then,
that one of the most salient criticisms
against our society is that we, in fact,
are constrained by the many relig-
ious taboos on sex. These taboos
have passed on perfunctorily from
generation to generation in our cul-
tural heritage. They have persisted
chiefly because of the conservatism
of the church, which up until recent-
ly has been regarded as a final au-
thority. Now it is openly admitted
that, as William Graham Cole, pro-
fessor of religion at Williams College
stated, “there can be no quarrel with
the secular world at this point. It is
right and the church has_ been
wrong. Sex is natural and good....”

As the result of a more realistic
approach, theologians and church
leaders are waking up to the evils
of religiously inspired suppression
of sexual behavior. Professor
Roger Shinn of New York’s Union
Theological Seminary calls such
suppression a “Christian heresy.”
Protestant theologian Dr. Seward

New Philosophy Defies Religious Taboos

Hiltner remarked that since man
is “a whole or total being, sex is
good if it serves the fulfillment of
man as a total being.” Summing up
the contemporary switch in atti-
tudes on sex, Dr. George Morrison
Carstairs, professor of psychologi-
cal medicine at Edinburg Univer-
sity, speaks of a “new concept”
emerging, “of sexual relations as
a source of pleasure, but also as
a mutual encountering of person-
alities, in which each explores the
other and at the same time discov-
ers new depths in himself or her-
self.”

Hugh Hefner, editor of Playboy
and spokesman for the move for
liberalized sexual behavior, warns
that the new philosophy is directly
opposed to purely selfish sex, the
type of relationship that takes all
and gives nothing in return. What
it expresses, rather, is the need for
a greater “enlightened self-interest”
in society. “Too many people today
live their entire existence in a group,
of a group and for a group—never
attempting ‘to explore their own in-
dividuality, never discovering who
or what they are, or might be.
Searching out one’s own _ identity
and purpose, taking real pleasure in
being a person, establishing a basis
for true self-respect—these are the
essence of living.”

Such a philosophy, then, does not
advocate license or promiscuity, for
this would lead to the cheapening of
sex. Rather, it is a direct attack on
the shallowness toward this subject
that we have for so long been guilty
of in our blind acceptance of tra-
ditional religious taboos—it is thus
a stand for less superficiality and

The first Mock Convention, held in
the Spring of 1908, set the precedent
for the enthusiasm that was to play
such an important part in the future
Washington and Lee Mock Conven-
tions. The Lexington Gazette re-
ported in its May 6, 1908, edition:
“The young gentlemen entered into
the meeting with the zest of seasoned
politicians plus the enthusiasm of col-
legians.” This was quite an under-
statement; fist fights broke out
among the delegates on the conven-
tion-hall floor.

The first mock convention was
held as a result of the enthusiasm
aroused by William Jennings Bryan's
visit to Lexington in the spring of
1908. He was unanimously nomi-
nated. In the same year the Demo-
crats published the W&L Democrat.
In 1916 it was decided that the party
out of office would be the party of
the convention, and the Republican
convention of that year published
the Clarion.

One of the most colorful and en-
thusiastic conventions was the last
Democratic Convention held on May
2-3, 1960. Former President Harry
S. Truman delivered the Keynote
Address with Senator Henry A. Jack-
son of Washington state following
up in the evening.

One of the most spectacular events
is the parade which precedes the main

In the 1960 convention the Florida
delegation threw a thousand oranges
from their float. (Juice and seeds
splashed all over cars, spectators,
and floats.) A Rhode Island tele-
phone booth from their headquarters
display tumbled from a float in front
of the Varsity Billiard Academy,
injuring one of the genteel of Lex-
ington. The Virginia delegation float
of a replica of the Merrimac, com-
plete with guns, smokestack, etc.,
caught fire in the midst of the
parade.

Truman Gives Keynote Address

Following the parade, 1700 people
crowded into the gymnasium (thou-
sands more listened outside to rig-
ged-up speakers) to hear Truman’s
keynote address. In it he cut up the
entire Republican administration,
with special emphasis on its foreign
policy with his usual “vivacity.” At
the end of his speech he dedicated
the Memorial Plaque in memory of
the late Senator Alben W. Barkley
who died of a heart attack during
his address at the preceding conven-
tion,

That evening ‘the activities contin-
ued as Senator Henry A. (Scoop)
Jackson of Washington state deliver-
ed the message. Following that were
the nominations and roll call for the
President of the United States.

The following morning at 9:30 the
balloting for the Presidential nomi-
nations in the Democratic party be-
gan and continued until Senator
John Kennedy was nominated unan-
imously and confirmed. It had been
expected that there would be five
main candidates: Kennedy, Hubert
Humphrey, Stuart Symington, Lyn-
don Johnson, and Adlai Stevenson.
It was thought that Kennedy would
emerge as the Democratic nominee
for President within about three bal-
lots. Actually he was selected on the
sixth ballot over Lyndon Johnson.

Again the W&L Mock Convention
turned out to be a foresight and in-
dicator of National feeling: Kennedy
was nominated by the National Dem-
ocratic Convention during the sum-
mer. Only once has the W&L Mock
Convention Democratic Presidential
nominee differed from that of the
National Convention. This was in
1912 when the Mock Convention
nominated Judson Harmon. The Na-
tional Democratic Convention even-
tually nominated Woodrow Wilson,
who went on to be elected President.

With the 1964 Mock Convention
coming in May, there has already
been much discussion and specula-
tion on who will be the Republican
standard-bearer in the 1964 elee-
tions.

Former WGL Great Dies

Albert Felix Pierotti, ’23, died
yesterday in Revere, Massachusetts
at the age of 68. A funeral service
will be held here Monday.

Pierotti, in his years at Washing-
ton and Lee, and those after, com-
piled a record that will not soon be
forgotten.

As a professional football player,
he is tied with Jim Thorpe for the
greatest number of games played.
As a baseball player, he pitched
against Lou Gehrig in Gehrig’s pro-
fessional debut. In 1933 he wrestled
Jim Landos for the championship of
the world.

In his freshman year at W&L he
lettered in four sports, As a center
on the 1916 football team he was
chosen All-American. He captained
two sports. He was a member of
O.D.K. and the Monogram Club.

Until his retirement in 1962, Pier-
otti taught and coached baseball at

Pierotti
Chelsea High School in Massa-
chusetts. He was president of the
Chelsea teachers’ association and

secretary of the Everett, Massa-
chusetts Elk Lodge.

At Washington and Lee he played
in the days of H. K. “Cy” Young,
a great football player and outstand-
ing W&L basketball coach.

In 1916 he played center on the
football team that beat Randolph-
Macon 8-0 and Navy 10-0, tied Rut-
gers and Georgia Tech, and lost to
Army by only 13-7. The team, an-
chored by Pierotti at center, was
said to have the “strongest tackle to

tackle line in the country.” The
Boston Post named Pierotti an All-
American.

That year he started at guard on
the basketball team, which was un-
beaten in 13 games. He was a star
pitcher on the baseball team, and
ran on the General track team.

As a graduate, he was one of the
first men to embark on the “pro-
fessional football circuit.” He was
coach and captain of teams from
Cleveland and Milwaukee.

In twelve years of competition he
played in 267 games, a_ record
equalled only by Jim Thorpe. He re-
ceived a lifetime pass to all National
Football League games.

He pitched professionally for two
years.

illness seems to be getting chronic as the Generals dropped
their sixth straight Tuesday to Roanoke, 96-67,

Baltimore and what will be Coach McHenry’s new charge,
,Lebanon Valley, face them tonight and tomorrow in away

 

On September 20, 1920, he pitched
the Boston Braves to a 3-2 victory ,
over the New York Giants, a defeat
which cost the Giants the pennant. |
The following year he won 27 and!
lost 4 as a pitcher in the Eastern
League. He pitched the game in|
which Lou Gehrig made his first |
professional appearance.

He taught in Chelsea from 1927
until 1962. During that time he also |
coached football and baseball.

His interest in Washington and
Lee continued long after his gradua-
tion. As late as 1950 he wrote to
Young to tell him of a prospect who |
was“ a very good end and an ex-|
cellent basketball player and a fine
baseball player.”

Pierotti was unable to attend the
1958 Homecomings’ Game, to which
returned so many of the greats from
the 1914-16 W&L football teams—

The two teams are a study in op-

they lost standout Dale Haines. They

Bad Night

In the Tuesday game, the locals,
who have not won since they beat
Pennsylvania Military before Christ-
mas, had to hustle to keep the score
from reaching triple figures for the
second successive night.

On the other hand, Roanoke hit for
a nifty 48 per cent to win their
eighth in a row and 12th in 16. The
Generals are now 3-11.

Morris Creger did nothing to hurt
his state scoring lead as he netted
26 to lead Roanoke. Creger is now
averging 23.5. He got help from
Steve Baker and Paul Dotson, who
contributed 18 apiece.

Fred Mindell, playing one of the
finest games of his career, scored
18 and topped the Generals’ re-
bounding effort. Lou Paterno hit for
12 and Bob Spessard sank 10.

Rebounds Lacking

The Generals met their defeat un-
der the boards. The locals pulled
down one offensive rebound in the
first half. They hit for 38 per cent
from the floor.

Washington and Lee’s two big
centers—6-5 Bob Spessard and 6-4

All five of coach Joe Lyles’ starters
fouled out before the last ten min-

Every starter had accumulated at
least three personals by half-time,

Beta and PiKA clinched playoff berths in basketball last

night with both teams defeating opponents played earlier this
season. The reason for the replays—protests by SPE and Kap-

pa Sig.

Beta, taking advantage of their rebound advantage, came

back from a 14-9 halftime deficit to down SPE 31-26. PikKA

had ‘to overcome Randy Poore’s 16*

point output in order to beat Kappa
Sig, 37-28. The big difference—re-
bounding again as PiK( controlled
the boards throughout most of the
contest.

The championship looks like this:

Beta, PiKA, Sigma Nu, and SAE all
competing for the crown won last
year by SAE. Sigma Nu and SAE
shape up as favorites for the play-
offs, which begin Monday.
SAE sported the best offense in the
season just ended, averaging 50 a
game, while Sigma Nu featured the
stingest defense, giving up little
more than 20 per game. PiKA pins
its hopes for an upset victory on
Bob Stauffer, while Beta hopes for
the championship will depend pretty
much on their demonstrated ability
to control the boards.

Handball

In handball, tournament pairings
were announced yesterday for the
playoffs which also begin Monday.
In Monday night’s first game, de-
fending champ Beta takes on last
year’s runner-up Delt, in a contest
which should decide the eventual
champion. KA meets PiKA in the
second match.

Wednesday night, Beta and PiKA
switch opponents, with Beta taking
on KA in the evening’s first contest.

Swimmers Lose;

Face Toughies

Two pool records were broken as
W&L swimmers were dealt a stern
56-39 defeat by American Univer-
sity in the team’s last home meet.

Old Dominion and powerful Mary-
land face the team this weekend.
The Generals swam this afternoon in
Norfolk and meet Maryland away
tomorrow.

The jayvee swimmers lost yester-
day to Massanutten, 54-41.

In the Tuesday meet, freshman
Bill Wildrick set a new pool record
in the butterfly, swimming 200 yards
in 2:05.1. A.U.’s Lavenstein cut 4
of a second from the 500 yard free-
style event.

Maryland is one of ‘the nation’s
best ten swimming teams, and should
have little trouble from the Gen-
erals. They have beaten such teams
as Navy and their swimmers hold
four W&L pool records.

Rau Rebellard and Don Dumphy
lead the team. Rebellard holds the
200 yard freestyle record in Dore-
mus, Dumphy the individual medley
mark,

Old Dominion, although they lost
to American by only three points,
did not face A.U.’s best. The Norfolk
team has been hampered by losses
through transfer and marriage.

The Generals opened the Amer-
ican meet with a medley relay vic-
tory. The medley team, which Coach
Norris Eastman calls his “best ever,”
has broken the old General mark
by eight seconds, and is only three

In This Saturday’s Contests

By GUY UNANGST

The Franklin and Marshall wrest-
ling team, Georgetown rifle squad,
and Virginia college track teams will
converge in Lexington tomorrow.

The VMI Fieldhouse will be the
scene of the 1964 Virginia State
Indoor Track Meet, featuring all the
Big Five and Little Eight.

In wrestling, F&M will meet the
Generals in Doremus at 7:30 p.m.,
while the rifle team faces George-
town at the VMI range at 2:30 p.m.

Virginia, VMI, William and Mary
and VPI will all be represented in
the State Meet. According to W&L
coach Norm Lord, the competition
looks plenty stiff.

He said the best chance for a first
would be in the high jump with
Robin Kell, who placed third in the
VMI Relays, held earlier this month.
Kell’s best indoor jump is 6-1.

Other events in which the var-
sity might place high, he said,
were the 500 yard run, with Skipp
Essex; the two mile run, with
Ralph O'Connor; and the mile re-
lay.

 

Brad Shinkle has a chance in the
freshman two mile run, his best
time being about 10:55. In the fresh-
man pole vault event, Lord cited
Johnny Graham, who may not enter
because of a pulled muscle. Graham
does about 12 feet.

The afternoon events begin at 2
p.m., and include mostly prelimi-
naries and freshman events. The
evening session starts at 6:30, clos-
ing with the mile relay at 9:15.

The Generals have but one more
event scheduled, a dual meet against
Bridgewater, February 26.

Franklin and Marshall, one of the
two teams to beat the W&L wrest-
lers last year, entered Saturday’s
meet with a 2-5 overall record.

F&M plays a_ stiffer sched-
ule than the Generals. Their two vic-
tories have come in matches against
Brown and Bucknell.

Paul Martin will wrestle 157 for
F&M. He defeated Tom Stover last
year in the 137 pound class. Steve
Dubner, the only other returnee, will
wrestle 177. Pete Winfield pinned

Braithwaite Replies To Rights Conference Evaluation

Editor
Friday Ring-tum Phi
Sir:

I wish to comment briefly on the
story by Tracy Harrington in last
Tuesday’s edition on the Bryn Mawr
Civil Rights Conference. There were
errors in it which should be correct-
ed.

First, the editor’s note preceding
the story said three students and a
professor attended. (Besides Har-
rington, there were Bob Potts, Lamar
Lamb, and Dr. Hodges.) The politi-
cal colors of these four are well-
known here.

I also attended the conference, and
as a conservative resent being omit-
ted from the note because of the
implication (also often manifest in
the public press, I might add) that
these “liberals” were the only ones
here interested enough to go.

Second, tthe exchange between Mr.

 

Kilpatrick and Mr. Farmer was not
a debate. Had it been, Mr. Kilpat-
rick clearly would have won. It was |
rather a statement of opposed posi-'

tions and an exchange of views on
specific issues.

Third, it is a gross distortion of
the truth that Kilpatrick “lost his
temper a number of times and fared
rather badly in argument with more
articulate Farmer.” Mr. Kilpatrick
argued with zeal and vigor, was
forceful, yes, admittedly even rude
on occasion, but he did NOT lose
his “temper a number of times.” As
for his faring “rather badly,” Mr.
Harrington obviously never has at-
tended a real debate, else he would
be able to distinguish emotional
rhetoric and ad hominem arguments
(Farmer) from clear, cogent reason-
ing (Kilpatrick), One may have dis-
agreed with Mr. Kilpatrick’s argu-
ment, and Harrington correctly
points out that almost all the dele-
gates did, but any judge of de-
bate would undisputably have found
the Richmond editor a winner.
