Brownell Names Six
To Organize ‘Contact’

By BILL CANNON
Blaine Brownell, Chairman of Contact, and Henry Queke-
meyer, Assistant Chairman, today announced the selection
of the remainder of the Steering Committee and their As-
sistants for next year’s weekend. Brownell also explained the
purpose of Contact in an interview with the Friday Ring-tum

Phi.

Newly elected members of the Steering Committee are Vic-

Galef Treasurer, Chip Roadman,*
Secretary, Larry Meeks, Publicity
Chairman, Jody Brown, Program
Coordinator, Pete Dinkel, Registra-
tion Chairman and Steve Hibbard,
Social Chairman.

Symposium

“Contact will be an Intercollegiate
Symposium presented ‘on behalf of
the administration, faculty, and stu-
dents of W&lL under the auspices
of the Interfraternity Council. In-
vitations will be sent to all colleges
and Universities on the East Coast,
and we expect at least 500 outside
students and visitors will partici-
pate,” Brownell commented. “It will
consist of an entire wekend of lec-
tures, discussions, and seminars with
guest speakers from colleges, foun-
dations, the government, churches,
and other organizations. We will at-
tempt to bring to this campus some
of the most controversial figures of
our time; people who have some-
thing to say. We will not invite
these speakers on the basis of po-
litical beliefs, religious belief, race
or social status.”

“The American Experience”

In aecord with the theme, “The
American Experience: It’s Implica-
tions For the Individual American,
the American Nation , and the
World,” Brownell explained, “We
will approach this intellectual prob-
lem along political, sociological, his-
torical, religious, economic, and
scentifie lines. This will all be with-
in the general framework of trans-
lating the American experience (ab-
stract as it is) on all levels into
modern conceptions and into a
meaningful knowledge for applica-
tion to the problems of a modern,
often confusing world,

“We do present varying view-
points and different aspects and ap-
proaches to an overall intellectual
problem. The theme was chosen for
two reasons: (1) to offer the widest
possible variety of speakers and
specific topics that would still ‘fit’
into a central unifying theme, and
(2) to offer the widest possible ap-
peal to the greatest number of peo-
ple--every intelligent person will be
able to get something of value from
Contact.”

Quakemeyer added, “Contact
needs the support, advice, and en-
couragement of every member of the
Washington and Lee student body
and of the faculty and administra-
tion. We will attempt to supple-
ment the present academic program

 

 

at W&L on the largest scale pos-
sible.”

“We feel that it is a burden on
everyone working on Contact, and
on all of Washington and Lee, to
assure that the first Contact will be
a success. It could be of inestimable
value to the University, and if it is
to be continued, it must succeed.
We will simply need the help of
everyone associated with Washing-
ton and Lee. With this we cannot
fail.”

Steering Committee

The Steering Committee will be
assisted by special committee who
will coordinate the work of the
weekend.

Galef, a ZBT from White Plains,
N. Y., will hhandle the finance of
the weekend. Assistant treasurers
include Ken Bernhardt, Harry Den-
nery, Patton Adams, and Rick Mar-
golis.

Roadman, secretary, is a Phi Gam
from Colorado Springs, Col., who
will be assisted by Jim Steen, Ed
Wood and John Zink.

Meeks, an SPE from Thomaston,
Georgia, will lead the publicity drive
necessary to put over the first Con-
tact. He has Billy Cannon, Dan

UCA to Present
Baumann Talk

Dr. Dieter Baumann will lecture
April 29, at 7:30 p.m. in duPont
Hall on the topic: “An Example
Illustrating Jungian Thought.” In
this lecture he will try to access
the thought of C. G. Jung on con-
temporary man’s understanding of
himself.

Baumann is a practicing pschiatric
analyst in Zurich, Switzerland. Be-
sides his private practice, he is on
the teaching staff of the C. G. Jung
Institute in Zurich. He is presently
touring the United States under the
auspices of the C. G. Jung Foun-
dation. While on tour, he is lecturing
at many of the leading universities
and medical schools in this country.

Baumann’s visit to Washington
and Lee promises to explore more
deeply the relationships between
psychiatry and theology. These two
fields overlap considerably. They
have the same focus: namely, they
both try to deal with the human
mind, emotions and structure of per-

Indian Speaks
On Tribal Life

By Warren Montgomery

Mr. Joe Sun Hawk, a Pueblo In-
dian from a reservation in New
Mexico, spoke before ReVue Tues-
day night. The content of his talk,
“Sunrise—a View from the Indian
Side,” was designed to give the
audience a feeling for the life of the
Indian today, his place in the Ameri-
can scene, his adherence to the past,
and his religious attitudes.

Mr. Sun Hawk did not attempt
to follow any pattern of thought in
his lecture; nor did the draw any
conclusions. Instead, he tried to
make his listeners understand what
sort of person the Indian is by a
combination of autobiographical an-
ecdotes and demonstrations.

Mr. Sun Hawk is, to begin with,
a truly typical Indian, not the Amer-
icanized Indian philosopher that
the ReVue audience first anticipated.
He is of Pueblo and Ajpachee des-
cent and is the grandson of the fa-
mous Geronimo. His home is the
Taos Pueblo, near Alburquerque,
where he is an important chief. Mr.
Sun Hawk raises cattle for a living
but he paints and writes poetry on
the side.

Indian Costume

During his stay here, Mr. Sun
Hawk wore traditional tribal garb—
a blue, knee-length tunic; black
breeches; white, embroidered slip- |
pers; and a scarlet serape. He wears
his hair long and braided.

Speaking of his people, Mr. Sun
Hawk stressed their close sense of
unity with the past, and their desire
to continue the ancient tribal cus-
toms. He said that the Pueblos live
happily on their reservations, receiv-
ing free school and free hospital
care. Each Indian has been given
160 acres of land, upon which he
usually raises cattle.

The predominant religion of Mr.
Sun Hawk’s people is a modified
form of Christianity—the American
Church (of which Mr. Sun Hawk
is a leader). Unable to completely
accept the European Christian theol-
egy, the Pueblos have combined
it with their ancient religious forms.
“Church services” last eight hours
and are at night in the American
Chureh, and they are conducted in
a wigwam. Peyote is substituted for
the traditional communion wine, and
ceremonial rattles and feathers play
a significant part in the rites. Old
Testament concepts, notably the
Ten Commandments, are rejected.
The only creed of the Indians is

faculty advisers attending the 35th
annual SIPA convention.

Delegates and advisers to this
year’s convention will represent ap-
proximately 175 preparatory and
high schools from eight Souhtern
states and the District of Columbia.

Childs and “Free Press”

Childs will be the first to appear
before the convention. He will dis-
cuss “The Free Press in a Revolu-
tionary Age” at 12:05 p.m. Friday,
May 1, in Washington and Lee’s
Doremus Gymnasium.

Sagendorf will give the delegates
a look at “Life With Popeye,” in a
talk at 1:55 p.m. May 1 in the gym-
nasium.

Trussell is scheduled to appear be-
fore the SIPA convention at 11:10
a.m. Saturday, May 2 to discuss “In-
terviewing Newsmakers: How and
Why.” He will speak in Lee Chapel.

All three speeches will be open
to the public.

Rise to Success

Childs has been a newspaper man
for 40 years, beginning his career in
1923 by getting a job with United
Press in Chicago immediately after
graduating from the University of
Wisconsin. In the 1930’s he studied
and reported the economic and social
effects of changing governmental
policies in Europe. He was named
Washington correspondent of the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch in 1934.

During World War II he was an
overseas correspondent in Europe
and South America. In 1944 his now-
famous column, “Washington Call-
ing,” was started and although he
continues to make Washington his
home base, Childs travels all over
the world to report first hand major
diplomatic conferences, international
crisis and summit or near-summit
meetings.

Sagendorf says of his work: “I
not only love my work and feel
sorry for anyone who only gets to
read the comics, but it’s also more
fun to draw them.”

While he was still in high school
in California, Sagendorf went to
work on the comic strip and later
became assistant comic art director
for Features Syndicate.

The Birth of “Popeye”

But when the syndicate decided
to do a “Popeye” comic magazine,
Sagendorf was asked to draw and
white the whole publication. In
1959, he again took over the daily
and Sunday Popeye strip while con-
tinuing to do the magazine.

Trussell is a journalism graduate
of Washington and Lee University
where he was elected to Sigma Delta
Chi, professional journalism society.

Since graduation he has been a
reporter and Washington correspon-
dent for the St. Petersburg (Fla.)
Times, was on the editorial staff
of Congressional Quarterly News
Features, and was in the Washing-
ton bureau of The Wall Street Jour-
nal,

dent of the Commerce School; Tim
O'Keefe, Lambda Chi, for vice-pres-
dent of Liberal Arts; Ashley Allen,
KA, for vice-president of the Sci-
ence School. Larry Meeks, SPE, is
slated for senior class secretary;
Henry Quekemeyer, Delt, for his-

An Evaluation Of Sines

The campaign is over, the honor system and the assimila-
tion committee are still intact, and life at W&L remains relative-
ly unchanged except for an acceleration in hour quizzes and
exam aprehension.

There has been much talk in the past week about the
honor system. Indeed, election week seems to be one of the few
times that the honor system is ever considered on campus.
Both parties supported the “‘system,”’ but at best the issue was
a superfluous one; everyone does support the honor system.
It is as much a part of our lives as the wejuns and regimental
stripe we put on for the early morning dash to the 8:25
classes.

And with good reason. For the honor system is a distinc-
tive feature of Washington and Lee, placing our campus head
and shoulders above the average college or university. The
honor system has had a great deal to do in establishing the
image of the Washington and Lee man—an image that we
should be proud of and support wholeheartedly.

We have heard this for such a long time that we tend to
take it for granted. No one questions the benefit to the indi-
vidual student of making him think for himself, and not copy
term papers word for word from some reference work on his
topic. The sense of personal integrity and self-respect
which it establishes is not something to scorn or be
ashamed of. It is only when we consider what life here would
be like without the honor system that we catch a glimpse of
the breadth of its influenced. Pencil guarding, cheating, theft—
all these facets of normal college life are unknown.

And yet, maybe we have misplaced the emphasis. Is our
concern so much with the system or with the honor which
the system breeds? Is it not true that the system is merely
an instrument, a tool which is used to evoke a sense of honor in
every student? The honor created is more important than,
and it is entirely separate from, the way in which it is created.
The means are hardly as important as the results which they
produce. It is not the system which has established W&L as
an honorable institution, but the honor which the system has
created. The system is important only for the results it pro-

vides. It is because the results are invaluable that the system |,

itself is of real importance.

The honor system is not to be taken for granted. Election
week and exam week must not be the only times that honor
receives emphatic consideration.

IFC Group Discusses W&L Social Life

By LARRY MEEKS

Approximately eighty guests at-
tended the second of ‘this year’s IFC
sponsored faculty-student discus-
sions last night at the Robert E.
Lee Hotel. Fifteen girls, student
leaders from Randolph-Macon, Hol-
lins and Sweet Briar, attended the
discussion in addition to the facul-
ty members and IFC representatives.

In view of the innovation of ask-
ing student leaders from the sur-
rounding women’s colleges, much of
the discussion centered around so-
cial activities at W&L with sever-
al groups concentrating on this topic.

It was generally felt that com-
bos were a “problem” because of
the combination of the noise, alcohol
and shedding of inhibitions. It was

brought up that the girls were just |

as responsible for the conduct as
the boys and that they were, per-
haps, in the best position to im-
prove conditions by demanding re-
spect from their dates and protest-
ing against undesirable aspects of
combo weekends.

It was also pointed out that per-
haps the enthusiasm for combo par-
ties was less than it has been, es-
pecially among the upperclassmen,
but that combo parties still main-
tain their undesirable traits. It was
also pointed out that there is little
to do in Lexington if you don’t care
for combo parties, and almost noth-
ing to do on “off” weekends.

Another group concluded that
combo parties are degenerate in that
they contribute to the lowering of

 

one’s morals. It was pointed out

mosphere with their “verbal grossi-

that the parties in themselves are| ties.”

not “degenerate,” but that it is
usually the actions of a few “drunks”
that give the parties their unde-

suggested that the combos them-

‘Victors’ Presents Simply And Openly
The Horrors And Agony Of World War

By BOB MOTTLEY

The Victors is a memorable film,
remarkable for what it contributes in
a simple and open
way rather than
through the sleek

and aseptic so-
phistication so
fashionable in

some cinema cir-
cles. There are not
many nuances,
but a _ series of
shattering emo-
tional episodes,
beautifully _ pre-
sented by a large
and talented cast. Carl Foreman’s
basic plan was to read _ personal
events into a news reel format; this
documentary method works well,
although there are gaps in the ac-
tion. If you have the usual movie
mind, (tenth grade caliber) you will
spend most of the evening wonder-
ing what has been happening to
various soldiers. With a little imag-
ination, however, you should see
that Foreman is dipping into groups
of personalities as they are wearied
and cheapened by the prolonged
trauma of war; what is left vague
and diffuse is quite as important
as what is clearly understood. We
do not have to know how Corporal
Frank Chase was wounded; we
should be concerned with his psy-
chotic state afterwards. The Victors
is not an epic as such, but a delin-
ination of the agony and horror of
a few individuals across the hideous

Mottley

 

tapestry that was the Second War
in Europe. The “image” of Johnny
abroad is not a favorable one, and
the difference between the trenches
and ithe home front is made unmis-
takably apparent through a superb
“misfusion” of music against mont-
age. Veterans have been moved be-
yond tears by The Victors, perhaps
because the film uses as a point of
departure a poem by Winifred Owen,
the brilliant young British poet
killed in the First World War (the
one to end them all, remember?),
that is as much a warning as a
lament. To express precisely what
Owen and Foreman are trying to
say, I must be blunt and hope that
you are intensely angered by what
must be said, for only then will
you understand it .

Let us take the average Washing-
ton and Lee student. He is, by his
own admitted standards, prejudiced,
jaded, “cool” instead of passionate,
taught to despise sentiment, to de-
test phonies in the only genuine
things he will ever know; he re-
flects (mostly) a political conserva-
tism that is as stupid as it is ar-
chaic; he is trained for a rut and
expected to conform to a grid of be-
havior sweetened with gentlemanly
overtones. He takes life lightly and
his country for granted. He has
never gone hungry, or dirty, or
been desperately afraid. He is taught
by habit and career requisites to
wear at all times to class a mental
contraceptive, so that he will never
have to worry about being creative.

Letters To The Editor

 

 

He enjoys thinking of himself as a
shackmaster: sex is a weekend thrill
instead of the cement for a marriage.
God is whatever Playboy approves.
He is also taught, by implication,
that he must be as an alumnus a
ratfink in the rat race; that it is
honorable and fitting to pursue the
Almighty—dollar, that is. Status and
flesh are his idols; superiority and
suaveness are his icons. Tis one real
fear is that at some point in his life
he will be called on to be a genuine
person and he will wash out. He has
it so soft that when he sees a film
like The Victors he will sneer man-
mully and comment: “Jesus, what
trash!”

Things were probably worse in
1943; suppose we take Slog and set
him down with an M-1 in Europe
just after D-day. Suddenly, his life
is pruned to esesntials; his idols
are reduced to survival and flesh.
The rosy visions of honor and
gentlemanly sportsmanship dissolve
into tthe harshness of conybat: our
former stud is now dirty, stinking,
unshaven, living, cheating, stealing,
and killing brutally all of his wak-
ing hours. He is not fighting for
God, country, or Roosevelt, but for
his own damn neck. The agony and
horror of war distort his mind to
the point where he is grateful for
the aesthetic beauty of a roll of
toilet paper. “Meaning and exist-
ence” consists of not bing shot by
a sniper, or having his groin torn
by shrapnel—or, on the positive side,

Doctor Examines Lewis’ Medical Care

Dear Editor:

The Ring-tum Phi issues of March
20 and 27 carry an appraisal of
medical care by Syd Lewis that
should not go unexamined.

First, it is logically untenable to
compare the vital statistics of the
U.S. with those of the homogeneous
nations of Europe. Our vital statist-
ies are unfavorably influenced by
a significant and increasing Negro
minority, a broad geographic area
with numerous sparsely _ settled
communities, a lack as yet of true
homogeneity of our more numerous
people with persisting pockets of
differences in culture, habits, etc.
International comparisons are tricky
and until such a time when social,
economic, racial and other factors
equalize between nations, it is futile
to make comparisons.

Second, it is also not tenable to|
propose state medicine because the |
rise of medical care cost is out of |
line with other services. In any |
comparative study of prices, the |
Consumer Price Index “does not re-|
flect changes in quality occurring
over a period of time.... The na-|
ture of the health services provided
to the public has been changing so
greatly and so rapidly that there is

 

 

some question whether the items for
which price information is collected
remain comparable over substantial
periods of time, or reflect the kinds
of medical services and drugs ac-
tually being purchased.” (Blue Cross
& American Hospital Assn.—Financ-
ing Health Care of the Aged, 1962,
p. 74.) Simply stated, the higher cost
is not for the same services.

The quality difference in med-
ical care and cost lies in such
items as more expensive and ef-
fective drugs, better laboratories
with new diagnostic tests, new
and better equipment, more hos-
pital trained personnel, and the
many health restoring services
that didn’t exist 20, or even 10
years, ago.

The Department of Commerce
figures show that physicians’ fees,
in purchasing power, are actually
less than those of 20 years ago (1960
figures). The largest increase in
medical costs occurred in hospital
care (343 per cent from ’40 to ’60).
This is largely due to the cost of
labor (an increase of 520 per cent
since 1947) which accounts for 70
per cent to 80 per cent of present
day hospital budgets. (Yet, one won-
ders what motive led the Secretary

 

of Labor to announce recently that
hospital personnel are still under-
paid).

To the opponents of state medi-
cine, the latest U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics are encourging. The
Bureau reported that the rise in the
medical care component of the Con-
sumers Price Index for 1963 was
the smallest in a decade. While pre-
viously rising at about twice the rate
of prices in general, medical care
prices are now going up at about
the same pace.

There are many qualified opinions
supporting and opposing state med-
icine. Such divergent opinions in
educated men of undoubted integri-
ty are the result of varied intellec-
tual and emotional evaluations due
to differences in upbringing, educa-
tion, experiences, interests, etc.
Hence, it is not surprising to see
these opposing points of view in
print and to cite one qualified au-
thority to contradict another. Oc-
cassionally, however, a discerning
remark may lead to better under-
standing of divergent views. Such a
comment appears in a footnote in
the Winter ’61-62 issue of Modern
Age by A. A. Shenfield, Economic
Director of the Federation of British

 

Industries (London). It deals with
the British Health Service and reads
as follows: “There are some things
in Britain that the people love to
tell themselves are the best of their
kind in the world.... this tendency
to pat ourselves on the back (we
even pat ourselves on the back for
not blowing our own trumpet!) can
have a powerful political influence.
Thus the left has propagated the
preposterous myth that we have a
National Health Service which is
the envy of the world. Described in
this way, the National Health Serv-
ice comes to excite pride even in
the Conservative’s heart, despite his
awareness of its many defects” (p.
55).

Another clue to better under-
standing these differences occurs
in the preface written by F, A.

Hayek to Financing Medical Care—
An Appraisal of Foreign Programs
(edited by H. Schoek, Caxton, 1962).
“It is a difficult task to obtain sober
and reliable evaluations and as-
sessments of activities which have
been monopolized by governments
and where the tendency in this di-
rection is generally favored by fash-
ionable political opinion and official
international organizations. But for

 

a people (U.S.) not yet committed
to such developments, it is most im-
portant that the public should be-
come aware of the other side of the
coin (p. VI-VII).

Those who advocate state medi-
cine seem to forget that physicians
are an integral part of the free en-
terprise system. While of some min-
or advantage to doctors, the history
of compulsory medical care systems
overseas in recent years, and even
today, is one where the medical
profession is at the mercy of the
government (it is such publicity that
is partly influencing medical school
applications). The authority direct-
ing medical care has complete pow-
er to decide what the people (pa-
tients) and doctors are to be given
and what terms.

The proper role of government in
a free enterprise economy precludes
compulsory medical care approaches
which abrogate the rights not only
of those receiving the care but also
of those providing the care. The
freedom of the people to choose the
type, extent and quality of medical
care depends upon the existence of
a medical profession that is similarly
unfettered in its freedom to fulfill
these desires. Edward Palmer, M.D.

who feel that they have to show off
to prove their age and masculinity.
The girls also felt that the com-

chance for either date to learn much
about the other and that they both
get only a superficial image of each

Baur Writes
On Elections

By DREW BAUR

Contrary to Rod Cockshutt’s opin-
ion, I don’t believe the last election
was “an obedient homage to our
own peculiar sacred cows.” This is
an insult to the intelligence of any
W&L student.

What the election of Jim Kulp and
the recent Ring-tum Phi elections
prove is that the school is conser-
vative in the barest sense of the
word. Did it ever occur to you, Mr.
Cockshutt, that the average student
here is satisfied with W&lL.? I did not
say apathetic, but satisfied. Most
of the people at W&L like it here,
appreciate the honor system, re-
spect the EC. From this point of
view we are conservative. We wish
to conserve what we have, because
time has proved it is a workable,
just student government.

It is not a system beyond criticism,
and certainly there are other possi-
bilities concerning the working of
a student government. However,
these recent elections show that most
students feel that Washington and
Lee should remain under our pres-
ent system. To say ‘that it is imma-
ture to accept change, only for the
sake of change, is, I think, in itself
immature.

Finally, I feel a word needs to be
said about Cockshutt’s attack on the
Delt and SPE houses. I am a mem-
ber of the Progressive Party and,
quite naturally, was not particularly
overjoyed to see them leave. How-
ever, whatever their reasons, they
were not immature ones. One house
bolted because they simply could
not justify one nominee’s candidacy;
the other bolted because they
thought their candidate was worthy
of a higher office. To charge them
with immaturity sounds like sour
grapes somewhere, and there should
not be any room for bitterness in
politics.

The year’s first Brown Cow
Award goes to Frank Bailey. After
driving all afternoon in search of
the Thornton Sisters, he finally
found them. In his enthusiasm at
finding them, though, he forgot that

spent the rest of the day getting
pulled out of a steep ditch.

BEST BET FOR THE WEEK-
END: Dodgers to continue losing

Dear Editor:

Re: Above letter

1. Even when Negroes are om-
mited from the statistics, the U.S.
remains inferior in almost all the
statistics I used. Furthermore, if
certain groups suffer more, then
medicine has failed to provide them
proper care.

2. Since 1958 (Base 100) services
have risen to 111 and medical serv-
ices to over 120.

3. Admittedly, the National Health
Service has not lived up to its ex-
pectations; however, this is only one
country. The story is different in
New Zealand. Moreover, as I stated
before, what is good for one coun-
is not good for all countries. This
is exemplified by captalism which
has failed in almost every part of
the world.

4. Our enterpise system is not
completely free. We found out in
the thirties that such a system was
unworkable. Now we must decide
where medical services fit in our
controlled economy.

Generals Lose Again, 12-5
For Second Loss in Week

The baseball Generals lost their third straight yesterday

to Bridgewater 12-5.

Again errors—five of them—were the team’s undoing.
Bridgewater scored just six earned runs.

Bridgewater led from the start, scoring three runs on a hit
and three errors. They sewed up the game in the fifth, scoring

 

Golfers Prepare

For Tournament

Washington and Lee’s golf team
beat Roanoke 8-1 Wednesday, met
Bridgewater here this afternoon,
and Monday has a very good chance
to challenge for the state cham-
pionship it has won three times.

Dick Drew and Mike Gocke tied
for medalist honors Wednesday
both shooting 72’s over the Lexing-
ton course. Both beat ‘their oppon-
ents eight and seven.

Roanoke’s only victory was re-
corded by Gary Coach, who de-
feated Bob Duckwall one up.

Twelve schools will gather Mon-
day at Hot Springs for the 36-hole
State Intercollegiate Tournament to
be played on Cascades Golf Course.

Virginia’s Cavaliers are defend-
ing champions in the medalist play
tournament. W&L’s Bill Wylie de-
feated defending individual cham-
pion John Verity in a dual match
earlier this year.

Wednesday’s victory gave
golfers a 4-1 record.

Ashley Allen, Lou Flanagan and
Tom Crenshaw all got three hits for
the Generals. Heumann and Wigert
handled the pitching. Heumann was
credited with the loss, making his
record 1-1.

It was the second game of the
week for W&L and the loss lowered
their collegiate record to 1-6-1. The
team is 2-10-1 overall.

Tuesday Fort Bragg scored six
runs in the first two innings and
coasted to a 10-2 win.

Dragon third baseman Gary Ewing
led the way in the five-run second
with a two run homer. He later
drew three walks, singled, and stole
two bases.

Dave Kirkpatrick led the Gener-
als with three hits in four at bats.
Responsible for both W&L runs,
Kirkpatrick tripled in the sixth to
drive in pitcher Pete Heumann, then
scored on Ashley Alllen’s fly ball.

Heumann looked good in relief,
giving up but one hit in three shut-
out innings.

Netters Extend Streak To Nine;
To Face SC Champion Monday

The varsity tennis team soundly
defeated two opponents this week,
running their winning streak to
nine matches.

Playing at home against Richmond
Tuesday, it swept to a 9-0 victory
without the loss of a set. Wednes-
day, playing at Death Valley, the
team beat Hampden-Sydney 8-1.

Tuesday the Generals will face
their toughest test. George Wash-
ington will be here and with them
will be Harvey Harrison, Southern
Conference singles champion last
year, and Buddy Goeltz, one of
the outstanding players in the Wash-
ington area.

Coach Bill Washburn said of the
match, “We consider the George

Washington match as the strongest

test of the team this season. The
boys could use all the support pos-
sible from student spectators.”

W&L will be strengthened in this,
the last home match of the year, by
the return of captain Jim DeYoung,
who has missed most of the season
because of a side injury.

John Baker, playing his first two
matches this week, should also be
in top shape. The varsity will be
at its top potential for George Wash-
ington.

ond match of the season Wednesday,

Trackmen Win Fourth
Despite Changes in Lineup

The Washington and Lee track
team, despite serious changes in
the running events, ran its win
streak to four and its season rec-
ord ito 4-1 Tuesday with an 85-60
win over Lynchburg College.

Coach Norm Lord made changes
in his runners, so that more men
could compete. Although the changes
made a difference in the point
spread, it was obvious from the start
that the Generals would have no
trouble.

Lord made such changes as plac-
ing quarter miler Skip Essex in the
880, and did not use star sprinter
Chris Kell in the sprints. The meet
was a good indication of the depth
that the Generals possess, and a
cheerful sign of things to come.

That depth can be used to best
advantage tomorrow at the Davidson
Relay meet. The trackmen were
runners-up in the affair last year
and Lord has high hopes of taking
top honors this year.

The meet, to be televised locally
in Charlotte, is composed of schools
about the size of Washington and
Lee.Lord is very optimistic about the
outcome, and is taking a full squad
of 18 men.

moves into the heavy part of the
schedule. The game, against the
North Carolina Tar Heels, is sche-
duled for 3 p.m.

Carolina will probably be the
Generals’ toughest opponent to date,
about on a par with Williams (who
beat the Generals 9-4).

The Tar Heels have played only
three games thus far, losing to Vir-
ginia 18-4, Washington (Md.) 17-5,
and Maryland 25-3. However, all
three of those teams are among
the top ten in the country. The
coaching staff does not consider
such lopsided scores indicative of
Carolina’s real ability.

Lacks Experience
Carolina is big and fast, with good
personnel, but lacks experience, par-

fense. According to defense coach

Carolina attackman Parker is 6’ 6”
and one of the best stickhandlers
the Generals will have to face.
Crease attackman Thayer is also
an excellent stickman, and goalie
Stanley is one of the best in the
country.

Center midfielders Williams, Tyler
and Howe (playing in that order)
are all competent, but the wing
midfielders lack experience.

Carolina’s offense is built around
their more than solid attackmen.
On defense they play either a zone
or man-for-man, but are expected
to play the former against W&L.

They depend mostly on the quick
clear or the Gilman clear to Parker,

“Mister T” they call him. He’s
career army, currently coaching the
Third Army champions. Last year
the wire services chose him all-
service baseball coach of the year.

“Mr. T.” is John Tatalajaski and
his team is the Fort Bragg Drag-
ons, who beat W&L Tuesday, 10-2.
His team, defending champions of
the East Coast Inter-Service Con-
ference, currently sports a 13-3
record, four of those victories
coming against the Generals.

He does have a bit of talent with
which to work. Three men—utility
man Dick Schmidt, catcher Mike
Stubbins and outfielder Bill Baker—
are owned by major league teams,
the former two by the Dodgers, and
Baker by Cincinnati.

Tatalajaski, a 21-year army man,
has a bit of non-pro help too. Wit-
ness pitcher Bob “Blood” Burns.
Burns, named All-Army pitcher
last season, pitched four games in
the army tournament. All four were
shutouts.

* * &

The tennis team will probably be
10-2 after this afternoon’s match
with Bridgewater. As a matter of
fact, they’re so good they should
beat Virginia.

Their toughest match, however,
will be Tuesday, against George
Washington, defending Southern
Conference champions. It’s at 3
p.m, and if you’re ever going to
spend an hour leaning over the
longest concrete footbridge of its
kind in the world, that’s the time
to do it.

Incidentally, you might take a look
at Howard Busse, who’s been play-
ing number six. Busse doesn’t have

a backhand. Ambidextrous, he
switches the racket from hand to
hand.

Another fellow with a unique
style is high hurdler Lem Mickle.
Not wanting to expend all that en-
ergy jumping, he just knocks over
all the hurdles. Must work—he won
the event in Tuesdays’ track meet
with Lynchburg. Time: 18.6.

Gay Gasque again took the shot
put and discus Tuesday, but no
record in the shot. Gasque had to
settle for 45’ 10”. Maybe he won’t
hit 50 this year after all.

Saturday Classes

Another group discussed Satur-
day classes and it was generally
felt by both faculty members and
students that they are undesirable.
It was felt that neither students
nor faculty members gain much in
these classes. It was pointed out that
perhaps, a five day week would
possibly take some pressure off stu-
dents allowing more outside work
and time for relaxing. It was noted
that the four day week has worked
very well at Randolph-Macon.
There was a strong feeling for dis-
missing classes on big weekends and
it was noted that this would only
be done at Openings and Springs.

suggest only the prospects of getting
drunk on 3.2 beer, having a piece
of stray tail on occasion, and watch-
ing a bad Frank Sinatra movie over
and over when the quartermaster
fouls up and forgets to connect with
a new flick. Deplorable as this sit-
uation was (and could easily be
again), Corporal Slog at least comes,
through the agony and horror of
war, to be thankful for life. Never
again will he take it so cheaply.
If he lives to be a Victor, his only
“victory” will be his improbable
existence as a completely sane man
when the stupidity abates into a
time of peace, and he can try to re-
construct the old ways.

Owen sadly despaired that there
would be a Second War; Foreman
suggests that there may be a Third,
and it may not end easily for every-
one in a rosy, warm glow from the
Bomb. If the United States is to
be martyred and bloodied as Eu-
rope was, our people will finally
understand at a terrible cost that life
itself is more precious than status
symbols or credit cards or any na-
tional myth of an invincible melting
pot. The living will envy the dead,
to be sure, but the irony will be
all the sharper if a few remember
Dr. Strangelove and The Victors,
two pre-Bomb films that under-
scored from two different view-
points the absurdity of war.

“t)Mottley Examines ‘The Victors’

Foreman’s direction of The Vic-
| tors is crisp and his photography is
done in uncompromising black and
white. George Peppard, Eli Wallach,
Peter Fonda, George Hamilton,
Jeanne Moreau, Melina Mercouri,
Romy Schneider, and Elke Sommer
head the superb cast. Laugh if you
will, but I am afraid that we will
have cause to remember The Victors
long after we have forgotten next
week’s offering, Tom Jones.

Lacrosse Team Meets UNC

(Continued from page 3)

 

One Man Injured

General midfielder Bill Price is
the only man on the W&L injured
list. He has a sprained ankle.

Today the freshman lacrosse team
met Woodberry Forest in a game
here.

Woodberry Forest had played only
two games thus far, beating Augusta
Military 5-2 (the freshmen beat
the same team 7-2), and losing to
Severns (one of the best) 5-2.

(One Block From Penn Station)

IN THE “TWENTY WINNER" CLASS is how SANDY KOUFAX of the world champion Los
Angeles Dodgers sees United States Savings Bonds. “When you're on the Savings Bond
team,” says the strikeout king, “you know you're with a winner. Why not join up this spring?
All you have to do is check that Savings Bond block in claiming your Federal income tax
retand. When you do, you're right down the middle on security—your own and your country's.”
