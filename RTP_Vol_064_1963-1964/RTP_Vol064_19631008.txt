Over Eighty To Be Present
To Promote Mutual Respect

By ROGER PAINE
Editor-in-Chief
Leaders from all campus organizations have been
invitations to the first Washington and Lee University Leader-
ship Conference. It will be held tomorrow evening, Wednes-
day, October 9, in the private dining room of Evans Hall.

issued

OPENINGS T0

Omicron Delta Kappa, national lead-*
ership fraternity, is sponsoring the
banquet.

Donald H. Partington, senior law
student and president of ODK, has
engineered the conference and ban-
quet. The original idea is attributed
to Prof. Rupert N. Latture, who sug-
gested that such a conference might
be beneficial to all campus organiza-
tions.

Over sixty student leaders and al-
most twenty faculty members, in-
cluding all active members of ODK,

will be present tomorrow. Mem-
bers of the Executive Committee,

fraternity presidents, the president
of the Interfraternity Council, a rep-
resentative from each varsity team,
Ring-tum Phi editors, and the lead-
ers of all other campus organiza-
tions are expected to attend.

Generate Mutual Respect

According to Partington, one pur-
pose of the meeting is “to generate a
mutual respect among the various
organizations, one for the other, so
each can have a better understand-
ing of each other’s role in W&L life.
Also, this can perhaps be a group
capable of handling problems not
within the realm of the Executive
Committee.

Partington plans to explore with
the group what possibilities there
are for such an organization to make
a solid contribution to the meshing
of campus leadership problems. If aj;
positive opinion of the merit of the |
gathering is formed, committees may |
be selected to pursue the most pres-
sing of the problems presented by |
the group as a whole .

 

Noell to Speak

At the banquet, Partington will |
make some introductory remarks as
will President Fred C. Cole. Bill|
Noell, president of the student body, |
will give a short address, after
which questions will be thrown to
the group. Ideally, such a group
would help coordinate student ac-
tivities, generate espirit de corps
among campus organizations, and
thereby eliminate some campus
apathy, according to Partington.

Openings in
Of ‘Collegian’
Might Be Late

By KEN McGRAW

As happens every year, October
finds a relatively small group of
students working in obscurity to

bring out Washington and Lee’s fav-
orite son and only humor magazine,
the Southern Collegian, in time for
its traditional debut on the week-
end of Openings Dances.

Editor Tain Tompkins has met his
deadline, but the perennial problem
of the cover advertisement threatens
to delay release of the magazine for
the third year in a row. The large,
four-color ad on the cover back is
printed outside the state, and in the
past, has proved susceptible to trans-
portation and production disturb-
ances.

“Will Not Disappoint”

Tompkins commented briefly on
the contents of this year’s initial
offering. Born out of post rush-
week confusion, the first issue last
year reflected the hate with which
it was assembled. Again this year,
time has not permitted all the
changes in policy and format that are
desired, but Tompkins guardedly
purports an issue that will “not dis-
appoint upperclassmen” who appre-
ciate writing which combines two
levels—the incisive and the prepos-
terous.

The editors generally agree that
the Collegian will remain in its nor-
mal ridiculous character, but may
invoke mild controversy, at least in
its initial appearance, which they
suggest will be “healthy in the ex-
treme, diverting, and in utmost good
humor.”

————— Te Crear

president of the Dance
Board, predicts that this concert
will not only present fine entertain-
ment but “something for the taste of
everyone.”

A number of releases in the last
few years have kept Roy Hamilton’s
name at the top of popularity lists.
Among these are: Don’t Let Me Go,
I Believe, Hurt, Ebe Tide, and If I
Loved You.

Hamilton offers Versatility

Versatility is one of Roy Hamil-
ton’s principal claims to fame. Many
attribute to this the fact that Ham-
ilton’s rise to popularity has been so
fast. In less than a decade he has
risen from a soloist in a church
choir to one of the top-rated popu-
lar singers in the country.

Besides his versatile voice, many
people are drawn to Hamilton by
the “sincerity and warmth” they
find in his voice. This quality in
Hamilton’s singing seems to have
made his spiritual songs and love
songs especially popular.

His first big hit was You'll Never
Love Again from Rodgers and Ham-
merstein’s Carousel. He gave the
song a fresh approach and his ren-
dition proved immediately success-
ful. This ability to give a song a
second popularity through a new
rendition has become a hallmark of
Hamilton .

Born in Virginia

Roy was born in Leesburg, Virgi-
nia, in 1929. His family soon moved
to Jersey City, New Jersey, where
he began singing in his church’s
choir at the age of six. In high
school Roy studied commercial art
and afterwards took up some ama-
teur boxing, but he never lost his
interest in singing.

Break Into Records

Hamilton began making occasional
appearances at night clubs as a
singer. At one of these appearances
he was heard by disc-jockey Bill
Cook. Cook reported him to Epic
Records and a contract was soon
signed. After his initial success with

Liberals Of W&L, Unite!

A new milestone was sunk into Washington and Lee’s
political turf last month with the publication of The South-
ern Conservative. With its second year in print this non-
profit newspaper has become progressively distinguished in
its format and in the quality of the writing it boasts.

The strongest point of The Southern Conservative. not-
withstanding its make-up and variety of articles, is the fact
that its editor, William Braithwaite, and those who assist
him, are very well-informed about the political philosophy
which they espouse. So informed, indeed, that they can pub-
lish both sides of many of the issues which they feel should
be brought to general attention.

Although we can say nothing but words of praise for the
integrity of this publication, we must recognize the fact that
the newspaper’s title correctly identifies its political inclina-
tions. The excellent job which conservative students on
campus are doing to promote their way of thinking brings
into bold relief the need for a similar organization of stu-
dents whose beliefs differ from those of the conservative

camp.

In light of the mock convention coming up next year,
it is important for as many students as possible to be familiar
with both sides of important political issues. We would like
to see the liberal students form a group, as they started to
last year, which could offer the student body an opportunity
to hear liberal speakers and to read about views held by

intelligent liberal politicians.

 

Pete Alford at the Sorbonne

 

W &L Senior Writes

(Editor’s Note: Pete Alford, a
W&L senior studying at the Sor-
bonne in Paris, wrote the follow-
ing letter to his parents shortly
after he arrived over there. The
letter contains Alford’s first im-
pressions of Paris and student life
there.)

Paris is first of all a crowded
area with almost 3 million people
living in an area 12 by 9 kilome-
ters. (Kilometer=6/10 mile.) The
grand Paris has 7 million inhab-
itants. I live on a small street
which is one block from the
Champs Elysees and just 4 blocks
from the Pardin de Tullieres.

If I walk in the other direction,
5 blocks, I am at the Are de
Triomphe and after I faire le tour
(or walk around the arc) I am at
Rue Victor Hugo. Two streets on
that is rue du Dome and the In-
stitute for European Studies. So
every morning I walk to class—If
I have time I walk up the Champs
or if I am pressed I go a quicker
way up rue Honore (named after
Balzac).

These first 2 weeks my day has
begun with cafe au lait, long
French bread, jelly and butter for
breakfast at Mme’s then to the
Institute for language lab at 8:30
and the second week at 9 (times
for this change every week) for
each student. At 10 I have a con-
versation class with Mr. Fonte-
villes for one hour. We prepare
each day 2 or 3 topics, not too in-
volved, and just talk about them.
The 45 students are divided into

A & B groups, according to abil-
ity, and I am in group A with
about 24 other students. At 11
am. we have a grammar course
which includes a dictee (dicta-
tion) every day.

My errors have become fewer,
but not to the level I will need to
pass this exam to take courses
there because the education sys-
tem is different in France. College
(French word) is equivalent to
our first 3 years of college in the

 

States. I may get around this be-
cause unlike the others at the
Institute I have had 3 years of
college.

At 12:30 we have lunch and af-
ter that I go across the street for
a cup of coffee and a little con-
versation with the proprietor of
the cafe across from the Institute.
There are few French students in
Paris now because the school
year doesn’t commence until No-
vember.

We have class for 2 hours each
afterhoon and 3 days a week de-
liver prepared 5 minute speeches
and the other 2 we correct with a
professor our written themes—we
write a theme of 1000 words a

  
  

week based on the lectures we at-
tend at the American Center.
These are held each weekday from
5:30-7:30 p.m. Then we have din-
ner at the Center. And then home
to study. There are also 2 hours
about, in the afternoon, to study.

My French family consists only
of Mme. Moanock. She has had
students before and speaks to us
often and helps us. We have one
bedroom with 2 beds, a room to
study which is really the dining
room and (she is very proud of
this)—trois Chambre d’eau (or
three rooms of water). That means
one room with a shower (twice a
week), one room with the toilet
and one with the sink. Each morn-
ing we have a thermos of hot
water to shave with. She has a
place in the country and goes there
every weekend. She has a TV and
is going to bring it back to Paris
soon,

Problems Beset

Dance Board

By ED CROFT ;

Dance Board President

The 1963-64 Dance Board in-
tends to bring variety to the cam-
pus social functions. Such artists
as Roy Hamilton, Stan Rubin,
Lloyd Price, Dakota Staton and a
sensational folk singing group
(to be announced later) will be
among the entertainers to appear
at Washington and Lee for Open-
ings and Fancy Dress. A change
in the Fancy dress schedule pro-
vides Saturday night free for fra-
ternity combos, as the concert
will be held in the afternoon.

Attempting to provide what the
students want in accordance with
what they can afford, the Dance
Board hopes that with the in-
crease in the price of the Dance
Plans along with a large partici-
pation in this program to be able
to bring to the campus the high-
powered entertainment which in
the past has been out of its price
range.

An item that has aroused con-
siderable criticism is the Dance
Board’s decision to increase the
price of the Dance Plan by $5.00.
The Dance Board is an organiza-
tion of the student body working
with its best interests in mind.
Anything that is undertaken is
voted on by the class and campus
leaders with the sole purpose of
providing the best entertainment
possible at a price which the stu-
dents can afford. This 1/5 increase
in price is necessary, since for the

Salinger’s Newest Stories

Called ‘Parts

By BERT PHILLIPS

“...and for a little reptile of a
critic to presume to find fault
with any of its parts, without
knowing the manner in which the
whole is connected....is a most

 

We Were Wondering...

Why the walks around the new science building
and duPont Hall were laid with right-angle corners,
when no students are known to walk that way.

I have seen two French movies
(1) Un Drole De Paroissien which
was about a man who made a liv-
ing stealing from the alms boxes
found in the churches in Paris and
(2) Germinal, which you know was
a novel by Zola about mine work-
ers in the 1860's.

The group of students at the In-
stitude is a good one but of a
makeup tht has not been familiar
to me. Ninety per cent are Catho-
lics and Democrats and though
there are a few Protestants and
Republicans I am the only one
one who is both an Episcopalian
and Republican. It should be in-
teresting for me—I was getting a
little too set in my way with the

same surroundings at W&L and
in Syracuse and this certainly is a
change.

In the morning I read Le Fig-
ero—a paper of the mileu (“the
people”), but yet informative. At
night I read Le Monde which cor-..
responds to the N. Y. Times. To-
day, for example, I read in Le
Monde an article by Maurice Du-
vergen, a great French political
scientists. Some one whom I read in
Pol. Sci. at W&L. (Translated of
course).

Life here is not cheap and dur-
ing the first couple of months
there are a good many purchases
that have to be made. I really
need some clothes so I can look
like a starving student, but so far
I have only bought a sort of brief
case for books for 10 franes. If
you buy with travelers checks
you get a 20 per cent discount in
the large department store such as

I haven’t seen all of Paris yet
but I have been to the Eiffel
Tower, Jardin Puilleiers and Lux-
embough, down the Seine in a
tourist boat to L ’ile de la cite’ and
Notre Dame. Tomorrow, Sunday,
I am going to Bois Vincennes
which is the largest zoo in Paris.
Paris has 100,000 students, a third
of which are foreigners. In two
weeks I will receive a pass which
will allow me a 50 per cent reduc-
tion on all transportation.... The
subway (Metro) will be about 4c.
All the students joined the Jeunes
Musicales Francaise which gives
us a 30 to 50 per cent discount at
a number of concerts, movies,
plays, shows at the Comedien
Francaise, etc. Also, when the
school year starts we can get meals
at any of 5 student resturants on
weekends for 1 franc, 20 centimes
or about 25¢ which is bon
marche . . . . cheap!!!

One article of clothing which all
students wear is a sort of jacket
made of leather or suede. I under-
stand they cost about 60 francs
(15 dollars) and | plan to get one.
Jim Phyfe, a Kent classmate, is
working at the Morgan Bank
and I plan to see him during the
year. He lives on the left bank.
Went to a concert the other
night... it was the first of the
JMF series and was free to stu-
dents.

There is a history of art course
given every Sunday morning at
9 am. at the Louvre. I plan to
take it. It cost about 5 centimes a
week, (100 centimes per france, 5
franes per dollar). Right now the
intensive French we are taking
is wearing all of us out. But as we
have been told and I know it to be
true...it is very important so
that we are prepared to take sub-
jects in French at a French Col-
lege... when their classes start in
November.

Of An Epic’

presumptious absurdity.”

—Henry Fielding, Tom Jones
In 1962 two stories appeared in
hardback editions: “Raise High the
Roofbeam, Carpenters” and “Sey-
mour, An Introduction,” which
J. D. Salinger had previously writ-
ten for the New Yorker. If one
were to read this book without any
previous knowledge of Salinger’s
writing, he would no doubt be
confused; however, these two rath-
er long, short stories should not
be considered as separate entities,
but rather as parts of an epic
which begins with Holden Cau-
field (The Catcher in the Rye) and
continues through all the other
stories which Salinger has writ-
ten. It is a story which is con-
cerned with what is perhaps the
grandest theme of literature: the
relationship of man to God, or lack
of God.

Bride at Atlar

“Raise High the Roofbeam, Car-
penters’” main scene takes place
during a traffic jam in a taxicab in
which Seymour Glass is discussed
by several guests who were to
have witnessed his wedding, but
which he had been “too happy” to
attend. Among these guests is
his brother Buddy, with whom
Salinger chooses to associate him-
self. The story concludes with
Buddy reading sections from Sey-
mour’s diary which is designed to
explain why he leaves his bride at
the altar, and to suggest why he
kills himself after his marriage.
Without “Raise High the Roof-
beam, Carpenters” the suicide
which ends “A Perfect Day for
Bananafish” appears motivated
chiefly by Seymour’s inability to
put up with Holden Caulfield
constantly referred to as_ the
“phoneyness” of bourgeois socie-
ty.”

To explain Seymour's suicide we
must first be acquainted with
the death of Salinger’s ten-year-
old Buddha, “Teddy.” Teddy is a
true Eastern mystic who sees log-
ic as “the apple eaten in the Gar-
den of Eden and the beginning of
man’s concern with material life
and separation from real, spirit-
ual life.” Teddy is granted through
mystic revelation the experience
for which Seymour longs. In
Teddy’s case, he withdraws him-
self from society in order to be
better able to experience union
with God, and perhaps Seymour’s
self-inflicted death could be view-
ed as a similar case. But it appears

:Coun Syuire

By A. L. BROCKENBROUGH
Wednesday, October 2
While grabbing a cup of coffee
in the Co-op this morning, I talked
to several students about the
Dance Plans. Some had _ bought
them, while others hadn’t and said
they didn’t plan to. I asked the
latter what their objections were.
Some thought the quality of the
entertainment was poor in compar-
ison to past years, and generally
out of keeping with the recent
trends in student taste. Others saw
no justification for the raise in
price. I wonder which of these
reasons caused the drop in sales.

Thursday, October 3

I talked to my freshman friend
today, Mike Newman. He was a
little bewildered by the dating sit-
uation here, having had a date
with a Hollins freshman this past
weekend. It seems she was as-
tounded, not to say scared to
death, by all the wild parties. I
asked Mike if he had done any-
thing to frighten her, and he said
no; he had passed out at ten, but
only for an hour or so.

Friday, October 4

One of my classes was so boring
today I fell asleep. I really didn’t
miss anything, though; the lec-
turer’s monotone was devoted to
reiterating the same stuff we had
read in the textbook the night be-
fore.

Saturday, October 5

I went around to a few of the
combo parties tonight and noticed
that while the twist had gone out
of style, nothing has risen to take
its place. In the past we have had
the “U.T.” and, I have heard, the

“P.U.”; why not a new dance
called the “W&L?”

Sunday, October 6

I didn’t get out of bed today

I am beginning to be suspicious
of people with hangovers. Many
of the worst cases just weren't
that loaded the night before. I
think it has something to do with
conservation; either the person
afflicted needs a topic to talk
about, so he manufactures one,
or he doesn’t want to talk at all,
this being a convenient excuse.
But I really shouldn’t point fingers
today.

School Spirit Applauded

Dear Sir,

On behalf of the Varsity Club
I would like to congratulate the
members of the student body who
responded so actively Saturday
to our program aimed at increas-
ing spirit at W&L athletic con-
tests. It shows that the apathy
with regard to cheering at W&L
games, which has been the rule
rather than the exception in past
years, can be overcome. I believe
the spectators enjoyed the game
more when they cheered, and I
know personally many of the
players on the field Saturday re-
ceived encouragement which they
have not known since high school
days .

I especially want to thank the
cheerleaders from Southern Semi-
nary and the Volunteers from
W&L who did such an outstanding
ing job in arousing spectator en-
thusiasm. The girls, who respond-
ed so ably to our plea of assist-

\3

 

ance, will be back for the re-
mainder of the home football
games and the _ entire home

Generals’ Gridmen Sharp In Rout Of Oberlin

Jackets Fall, 6-1,
To W&L Soccer
Men; Henry Ace

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

After a slow start the Washington
and Lee soccer team scored three
goals in the third period and two
in the fourth to trounce Randolph-
Macon, 6-1, here Friday.

The Generals scored the only goal
of the first half in the initial stanza
when Tim Henry got his first of two
goals. After that both goalies were
invincible for the remainder of the
period.

Late in the second quarter the vis-
itors’ goalie was injured and was
removed from the game. This was
the turning point of the game.

Decisive 3rd Quarter

The third quarter was decisive
as W&L wasted little time in ac-
quainting the new Macon goalie to
the excellence of the front line.
Henry picked up his second goal
to give the winners a 2-0 advantage.
Charlie Sweet followed Henry’s ex-
ample by scoring, although he did
it without the advantage of his feet.
Sweet knocked in the third goal with
his head.

Macon got its lone goal shortly
after Sweet scored. Jim Mell got it
back for the Generals in the same
period when he scored while trying
to pass to Steve Hibbard. Mell's pass
went “astray” and dropped into the
upper right hand corner of the net.

The Generals added two more in-
surance goals in the fourth period
on shots by Hibbard and Preben
Berthelsen. Hibbard scored his in
the same fashion as Sweet with a
nice set-up pass by Henry.

Green Outstanding

Tom Green had is usual outstand-
ing game at goalie, making numer-
ous saves, but the phase of play by
Green that drew the most comment
from his teammates was his goal
kicking. For the layman goal kick-
ing is what the goalie does with
the ball after making a save. He
kicks the ball down field as far as he
can to give the offense a chance
to have the ball as close to the op-
ponents goal as possible. One of
Green’s teammates said that he
thought Green’s kicks were going
almost three-fourths of the field.

Other stars of the game were
Bruce Jackson, who played his usu-
al fine game, and Howard Bussey.
Bussey, who was converted from
wing to fullback this year by Coach
Lyles, has adapted to his new posi-
tion very well.

The most improved player in this
game was Pete Preston. Preston,
who plays fullback, has improved his
kicking immensely.

The black note of the game was the
injury to Dave Redmond in the third
quarter. Redmond received a dis-
located jaw while fighting for a
bouncing ball.

The freshmen team appears to be
coming along nicely. The Little Gen-
erals dropped a tough 2-1 decision
to a good Lynchburg squad Thurs-

 

day at Lynchburg.

Staunton Military Academy on Wilson Field.

The great depth of the General’s representatives again paid off in vic-

 

return of a sideline pass accounted*
for the only scoring of the game.

The Baby Generals farthest drive
came in the first series of downs
when Quarterback Bryant Kendrick
and Halfback John Bogart moved the
ball from their own 35 to the SMA
20 only to have an offsides penalty
and a dropped pass kill the march.

Defensively, Bill Sledge, Bill Gam-
bill, Charlie Myers, Logan Bullitt,
and Bob Reading held the SMA run-
ning attack in check, and were in
the SMA backfield or throwing the
quarterback for a loss, most of the
game.

Offensively guards Roger Milam,
Skip Brooks, and Steve McElhaney
sprung Bogart open a number of
times.

Coach Swan sums up the game:
“The boys came to play this week.
It was 100 per cent improvement
over last week’s game, and it showed
us and them what they are capable
of. We lost on our own mistakes:
an interception, and a long run re-
sulting from a fumble cost us the
game.

“Our defense played an outstand -
ing game, however we still need of-
fensive punch—next week we'll have
both.”

The Baby General’s next game
is on Wilson Field Friday, Oct. 18
against Augusta Military. “AMA
uses U. S. C. coach McRay’s shift-
ing-I and it should be a wide open
game,” concluded Swan.

McDaniel’s Long
Passes, Defense
Earn 29-13 Win

By JIM CROTHERS
Assistant Sports Editor

Whereas last week, Washington
and Lee relied on outstanding per-
formances from several individuals,
it was a team effort Saturday that
powered the Generals over the visit-
ing Oberlin College, 29-13.

Strong defensive stands inside the
20-yard line, long passes from John
McDaniel to Buck Ogilvie, and
three alternating teams were too
much for the Ohio Yeomen as Wash-
ington and Lee scored 21 points in
the second half to win its second
game of the 1963 season and eighth
in a row.

Yeomen Strike First

Oberlin surprised the Generals in
the second quarter by drawing first
blood with a 7 yard pass from Jim
Wright to fullback, John McCaslin.
W&L, however, came right back and
seored on fullback Syd Butler’s
two yard plunge four plays after
Ogilvie had blocked a Yeoman punt
on the Ohioan’s own 1l-yard line.
Henry Sackett added the two point
conversion with an end run to put
Washington and Lee ahead to stay,
8-7.

Sackett ran Oberlin’s second-half
kickoff back 35 yards to the W&L
45-yard line where Butler and soph-
omore Harry Brookby continued the
drive with several powerful end-
sweeps to the Yeoman 26. McDaniel
then lofted his first of two scoring
passes to Ogilvie, and Brookby ran
the conversion for his first two W&L
points.

Yoffe Adds Clincher

Needing only eight plays the next
time the Generals got the ball, they
marched 54 yards and potential Lit-
tle All-American Stu Yoffe added

’| his third touchdown of the season to

hike the score to 23-7.

After holding Oberlin on the
W&lI 15-yard line with a fine de-
fensive effort early in the fourth
quarter, Washington and _ Lee
mounted its final scoring drive.
Yoffe’s 18-yard end-sweep, two long
gains by Sacket, and a fullback draw

’| by Butler good for 15 yards high-

lighted the General march to the
Yoeman 15-yard line. Another Mc-
Daniel-Ogilvie pass completed the
W&L scoring and upped the score to

Croft Urges Support For Dances

(Continued from page 2)

past ten years the price of the
Dance Plan has remained stable
while the cost of big-named enter-
tainment has increased consider-
erably. Five years ago Hamilton
cost $1500; now he demands and
gets $2500, an increase of 2/5.
This rise in the cost is exemplary

highly unsympathetic to a situa-
tion beyond the oroganization’s
control.

Although there are legal means
of extracting retribution for such
breaches of contract, pecuniary
compensation does not repair the
damage already done to the week-
end. Money that would have gone
to these entertainers is returned

 

of that throughout the entertain-
ment field and is the necessary
justification for the 1/5 increase in
the Dance Plan price.

to the Dance Board fund to pay
for the rest of the year’s enter-
tainment.

This new school year heralds
an inevitable change. Because of
the drop-off sales this year, it
seems that perhaps the reason is
the price increase. Gentlemen,
look not to the past. The Dance
Board can operate successfully
with your continued interest and
support. Let's see some school
spirit applied to your Dance Board.
I ask you to reconsider the offer
of a $30 Dance Plan in the light
of the intentions of the current
Dance Board. Dance Plans will
be on sale again this week.

seems not so much to bring to these
songs new stylings or highly per-
sonalized arrangements, as to be
singing them for the first time.”
The albums put out by the young
singer attest to the variety of sub-
ject matter his voice is capable of
treating: “With All My Love,” “Mr.
Rock and Soul,” “Have Blues Must
Travel,’ and “Spirituals.” In these
albums he sings both old favorites
and new songs. His greatest success
seems to have been with the old
favorites.

considered as too much verbal
ado about not quite enough. But
Salinger gives answers to the
problems which Holden Caufield
first struggles with in The Catch-
er in the Rye. In Seymour’s and
Teddy’s case, a reader searching
for his own “answer” will most
likely be disappointed. We don’t
have too many Buddhas-to-be in
our Western society, but as I have
stated, Salinger does give a more
“practical” answer to those search-
ing for meaning in an earlier book,
Franny and Zooey. Salinger speaks
for all those who have not hope—
or at least interest—in the search
for love and union with God in the
present-day world. Surely there
is a need for such a search in any
