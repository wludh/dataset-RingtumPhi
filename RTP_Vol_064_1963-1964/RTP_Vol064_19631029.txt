In Richmond Speeches

 

Conservatives Espouse Doctrine

By BARRY VAUGHT

Last Thursday Wyatt Durrette and
Bill Braithwaite, two members of
the Conservative Society of Wash-
ington and Lee, went to Richmond
to give two talks, one at Marymount
Catholic Girls’ School and the other
at the Medical College of Virginia.

Their speeches at the Marymount
School concerned the conservative
stand on four topics: the nuclear
test ban treaty, the sale of American
wheat to Russia, civil rights, and
Barry Goldwater’s chances for the
Republican nomination. At the Medi-
cal College they presented a general
statement of conservative principles
and the liberal principals on the in-
dividual versus the collective concept
of man.

Four Main Topics

Thursday afternoon at the girls’
school they gave these views on their
four topics. They felt that both the
test ban treaty and the wheat sale
were not going to help the United
States’ position at all, for at this
time Russia has found it must put
more money into its total economy
rather than just its military econ-
omy. To stop nuclear testing would
enable them to direct that money
into the rest of its economy, and,
for example, enable them to buy
American wheat. Also, Russia has
broken 50 of the last 52 agreements
they have made with the United
States. For these reasons the con-
servatives oppose these measures.

On ‘the topic of civil rights, they
posed questions and asked each per-
son to answer them in their own
mind. They also pointed out that
while Goldwater did, at one time,
help the NAACP in his state, he is
opposed to the present civil rights
legislation. And about his chances
of receiving the Republican nomina-
tion, they felt he had an excellent
chance. From a poll it was found
that 68 per cent of all Republicans
are considered conservative, and
77 per cent of the members of the
House of Representatives consider
themselves conservative. He also en-

 

joys great popularity in the South-
ern states, for the South is generally
conservative.

SPE’s Prepare
To Move Into
New Residence

ByCHARLES NEWMAN

A new sight in town has been
the work going on at 110 Preston
Street. This is the site of the new
Sigma Phi Epsilon house. The house
was purchased in August and work
began on the first of September with
the return of the actives of SPE.
The moving in will hopefully take
place some time next week.

The house itself was built around
1850 and has changed hands several
times since. There are three floors
and a basement. The first floor con-
tains two dining rooms, a living
room, and a lounge area. The ceil-
ing on the first floor has been
covered with acoustical tile. The
second and third floor will accom-
modate a maximum of twenty-two.
The third floor has a forced ex-
haust system for better cooling.

The whole house has ben re-
wired and has new sockets and
outlets. The plumbing has been re-
worked and new fixtures added. The
entire house has been painted and
a porch with four columns added to
the front.

Student-Faculty Banquet Plans,
Fund, Drive Discussed By IFC

By MIKE HASH
Plans for the upcoming Faculty- |

Student Banquet, the results of de- |
ferred rush, and fraternity participa- |
tion in United Fund drive were the |
main topics of discussion in the IFC |
meeting Monday night.

Art Broaddus, IFC President, pre-
sented the details of the banquet.
Members of the faculty and two
representatives from each fraternity
will meet in discussion groups fol-
lowing dinner, which will be held in
Evans Dining Hall. Topics will in-
clude the future of fraternities, em-
phasis on scholarship, rushing and
pledge training.

New Pledges

Five fraternities announced new
pledges acquired during the defer-
red rush period. They are: Lambda
Chi Alpha—Dan Eadie, Skip Brooks,
and Scot Jarrett; Delta Upsilon—|
Bob Robertson, Brad Rochester, and |
Jeff Skarda; SAE Randy Chitwood; |

 

Kappa Sigma— John Hillyer; and
Phi Kappa Sigma—Jim Cooper and
Chip Gordy.

Beta sophomore Steve Yancey was
elected chairman of ‘the IFC chari-
ty drive. During the drive, each fra-
ternity will be asked to support the
United Fund through a chapter as-
sessment.

New Constitution

A new constitution was discussed,
which is being drafted by a consti-
tutional committee. The committee
expects to present the new consti-
tution to the IFC in a few weeks, at
which time it must be ratified by
the fraternities in order to become
effective.

lege, they presented a program con-
cerned with America’s traditions as
seen through a conservative’s eyes.
With the advent of the new views on
so many things, the old American
inheritance is being thrown away
without regard to whether it is good
or bad. They stressed the pood points
found in American history and re-
minded those present that many
tend to only remember the bad
events in history. One should love
the things his ancestors fought for
and wanted to pass on to later gen-
erations. Then they presented a short
resume of the foreign policy from
a conservative standpoint.

 

Debate, Concert Highlight
Parents’ Weekend Events

What one administration official
described as “the most successful
Parents’ Weekend yet” was news-
worthy, in particular, for the num-
ber and quality of activities held
for the visitors.

Chief among these activities were
the faculty discussion on economics,
the demonstration student debate,
the Glee Club concert and the facul-
ty discussion on “Why Johnny Can’t
Write.” (See story, column 3.)

“The Proposed Tax Cut: Its Ef-
fect on the Economy” was the topic
discussed by Dr. Jay Cook and Dr.
Charles F. Phillips, Jr., Friday night
as a feature of Parents’ Weekend.

The discussion, which consisted of
a statement from each speaker and
a discussion from the floor, was
narrated by Mr. John F. deVogt.
In a brief introduction of the topic,
Mr. deVogt outlined Kennedy’s pro-
posed tax cut, which will cover a
three-year span and amount to a
net cut of $10.4 billion.

Reserve Board Holds Key

“Nobody’s sure what’s going to
happen—it depends on our spend-
ing and the Federal Reserve Board,”
said Dr. Cook, in reference to the
fact that the effectiveness of the tax
cut depends upon the Federal Re-
serve Board buying long-term
bonds, to encourage investment by
not borrowing from the public.

Dr. Cook spoke of the effects in
investment and consuming resulting
from the proposed tax cut, and
stressed the importance of the di-
rection of consumer spending if we
have a cut. The greatest cuts, ac-
cording to Dr. Cook, will be in the
highest and lowest income brackets,

 

Mass Medias

Parents’ Weekend. *

The trio of professors claimed that
the inadequacy in most freshman
writing lay in lack of organization,
inability to mold sequences and the
relation of thoughts, prolixity, and
vagueness. They blamed these faults
on faulty use of the language in
government press releases, periodi-
cals which incorrectly use phrases
but do it often enough to have them
coined, the superlatives and abso-
lutes used in the advertising media,
and professional jargon.

Professors Challenged

The most interesting part of the
evening came when, shortly before
9 o'clock, the discussion was opened
to the audience. Mr. Duval had
closed official comment with two
passages—one from Bacon’s “Of stu-
dies,’ and one from Donne’s “Med-
itations.” Both were examples of the
excellent examples use of our lan-
guage, according to the professors,
and they concluded by saying tht it
was the responsibility of the pres-
ent generation to recognize what our
forebears have done with the English
language, and meet our challenge
of carrying on this work.

This evoked a spirited response
from one parent, who asked if the
models chosen by the professors
were not too high—if it wasn’t ridic-
ulous to ask a freshman to endeavor
to write as Donne and Bacon did.
He stated that he felt the effort
should not be made—that such a
goal should never be set.

Few Future Donne's

The English professors objected,
pointing out that they expected few,
if any graduates of Washington and
Lee to be future Donne’s, but that
no one was penalized for failing to

to be aimed for by the most ambi-
tious. The parent objected again,
saying that he would wager that
twenty-five years hence, at W&L,
parents and professors would still

 

 

be holding panel discussions about

Mess-Up

By Lousy Use of Lingo

Professors Duvall, Coulling, and Boatwright of the Eng-
lish department blamed the poor writing of many college fresh-
men on the poor example of their most immediate predeces-
sors in an informal talk entitled “Why Johnny Can’t Write”
last Friday night. The panel discussion, given before a half-
filled duPont Auditorium crowd, was part of the program of

the poor writing ability of fresh-
men, so why be so concerned about
it now?

Mr. Boatwright answered this by
saying that there is strong evidence
of a definite decline in the ability of
the average American to write, as
compared with his nineteenth cen-
tury forebear. Civil War diaries dem-
onstrate excellent writing, he said,
for the type of person who was doing
the writing. People of today of the
same educational background can-

and may help to absorb unemploy-
ment by taking up some of the idle
capacity of the working force.

An Element of Santa Claus

“I think the present tax-cut pro-
gram has an element of Santa Claus
in it—a little bit for everybody!”
commented Dr. Phillips, opposing
Dr. Cook’s viewpoint. Dr. Phillips
further stated that “Our problem in
1963 is not to take temporary meas-
ures, but to take a ‘long-run’ point
of view. To strengthen our economy
we need a five, ten, or fifteen year
plan—not a one or two year pro-
gram.”

Dr. Phillips suggested a five-year
program, to avoid burdening the
country’s international payments,
and to avoid any severe cutbacks of
the national budget.

A discussion from the floor fol-
lowed the two talks, during which
the speakers answered questions
and discussed other aspects of the
national economy.

 

Jefferson: A Traitor?

Also held Friday night in conjunc-
tion with Parents’ Weekend was the
student debate on “Resolved: That
Thomas Jefferson Would Be Tried
for Treason Today.” The affirmative
side was taken by Mike Hayslip and
Bill Noell. Defending the negative
were Al Eckes and Jay Clark.

The affirmative debated that Jef-
ferson would be out of step in four
fields: Economics and social, dis-
cussed by Hayslip, politics and edu-
cation, discussed by Noell. Econo-
mically Jefferson wanted a bare
minimum for a national debt, and
he believed that a person should
never be taxed more than 1 per
cent of his income. Jefferson was an
ardent supporter of states’ rights
and was in favor of rebellion and
revolution. In education Jeffedson
thought tthe federal government
should have nothing to do with the
school system.

The Sabers and Sensations have
been extremely successful this fall
and have been booked every week-
end for combo parties here and at
U.Va. They plan to go back for
Openings at U.Va. on Nov. 8, 9, 10,
and will play all three days.

Before Christmas vacation the
Sabers and Sensations will play at
a debutante ball in Danville, Va. In
the spring, they plan to go to Ft.
Lauderdale, Florida. Last year they
played at U. N. C., a number of local
girls’ schools, and at the Cloister in
Sea Island, Georgia.

Spring Trip

Aside from singing at the Mary
Baldwin Christmas Dance, and a
few informal appearence at other
local girls’ schools, the Sazeracs have
no definite plans for this fall. In the
spring, however, they will be going
to Palm Beach, Florida, for the sec-
ond year in a row to sing at the
Taboo Club. Last year, while in
Palm Beach, they appeared on tele-
vision.

The Waysiders plans for the fall

sang at various fraternity houses
on campus. Following this they will
go to U.Va. for Openings Dance
there. Over Christmas vacation they
will be playing in either Washington
or Baltimore.

ers. Following this they played at
the Flambeau in Baltimore, the Sec-
ond Fret in Philadelphia, and the
Dulcimer in Ocean City, Maryland.
Singing Fraternity

The Sazeracs are the oldest of
the informal groups on campus.
They were formed in 1955. With
the addition of two new men, Rob
Vaughan and Pete Hendricks, their
group now numbers an even dozen.
The president of the Sazeracs is
John Weinbrenner, and the manager
is John Baker. The others in the
group are Bill Staniar, Chuck Grif-
fin, Dave Streetman, Eric Wilson,
Dave Britt, Bob Aylan, Bud Good-
heart, and Mark Gee. The Sazeracs
describe themselves as a “social
singing fraternity,” and as Staniar
commented, “Our aim is to have fun
with the songs we do.” The LP
record which the Sazeracs have
coming out this fall gives a good
example of the variety of songs
they work with. Samples off this
album are “Somewhere Over the
Rainbow,” “Gunslinger,” and “Ben-
ny is from Heaven.”

Campus Eyesore

Imagine yourself, for a minute, as a proud parent who
has come to see his son’s school. You are about to take a
sight-seeing tour around the campus; you walk through
the arch of the dorm and across the quad, down the
sidewalk—and what is the first thing you see?

That’s right.

The old “Co-op.”

Ignore, if you will, the paint hanging off in slabs, the
cobwebs on the windows. Aren’t you inclined, though, to
wonder what the building is used for? When you are told
“nothing,” aren’t you liable to be slow on the draw the
next time you get a letter asking for a donation to help
finance a project like the recently-completed science build-
ing?

The uses for this building are restricted only by the
imagination. Right now it contains a couple of offices, and
ninety percent of it is used for storage space. There are
a few courses that are too large for any classroom the
school has; if the old Co-op was cleaned up it would do
admirably. And it is a safe bet that many students would
like to see a concession started again, since the new “Co-
op” is often closed when you need that cup of coffee.

However, if the building is allowed to stand idle—
as we imagine it will—let’s at least give it a coat of paint
so we won’t be embarrassed to show visitors around cam-

pus.

‘Long - Distance Runner’
Lacks Only In Excitement

By Tom Pace
The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner plays for the last
the last time tonight at the Lyric Theater. It is a film by Tony
Richardson, who may soon lay his claim as the finest of English
film-makers.

 

In his past movies, Richardson has displayed
several talents requisite of a great director: an
ability for handling actors and drawing excellent
performances from them, an ability for bringing
both characters and story to life, and an ability
to mix humor and drama in a successful blend.

Yet two primary qualities are lacking in
Richardson—the craft of creating with the camera
alone and, it follows, the ability to generate ex-
citement through meaningful creativity with the

camera.
Original Use of Camera

In The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner
Richardson conquers the first of these problems
and shows promise of solving the second. This time he seems willing
to play and experiment. His camera rolls, runs, stops, speeds up, all
in an attempt to achieve the precise mood desired. That he suc-
ceeds in evoking the right mood, time and time again, with only
the moving camera as a tool indicates he has cleared the first of these
hurdles .

The title itself presents what was Richardson’s major problem
in the making of this film. By its statement, Richardson is required
to explain not simply why the runner is lonely, but how he is lonely,
ie., the substance of his loneliness. In order to accomplish this the
director could not merely show ‘the character and his external en-
vironment. He also had to probe and explicate the character’s mind.

Flashbacks Establish Depth

He does this by the use of flashbacks. Through the flashbacks
you see Colin Smith’s thoughts. You see not only the causes, but also
the effect of his loneliness within him. However, in accomplishing the
problem set up by the title, a fault paradoxically evolves. Though
scattered throughout the film, the flashbacks are in fact ordered and
have a chain-like logic. Thus the illusion of reality is partially de-
stroyed, since obviously nobody does think in chains of events, or
logical order. Yet this seems but a minor blemish, for Richardson
enacts these flashbacks smoothly and consistently so that they do
not disturb the viewer.

No Excitement Generated

The film falls short of greatness because of the reason stated in
the first paragraph. Richardson is unable to generate enthusiasm
and excitement despite a significant theme and despite his many
significant capabilities. Unlike Truflaut, who has the distinct genius
for making you feel that each of his films is a great one, no matter
how trival his subject, Richardson lacks fulfillment. Nonetheless,
Richardson shows certain promise that he may well become one
of the four or five great directors of this time.

Beginning tomorrow at the Lyric is Rashomon, a film by Akira
Korosawa, one of the few men who already rank in the league to
which Richardson aspires. And fortunately, Rashomon has the repu-
tation as Korosawa’s best, and as one of the finest films of all time.
I have not seen it yet, but pre-judgment concludes it is probably a
masterpiece.

Openings In Retrospect:
The Freshmen Enjoyed It

Editor’s Note: After Openings Weekend had come to a close, the
Tuesday Edition of the Ringtum Phi sent freshman reporter Neid
McGehee through the dorms to question his classmates as to their
reactions about the events which took place. Forty-two freshmen
were questioned, and the results of this survey are offered below.

In the opinion of most of those students polled, Saturday night’s
concert with the Upsetters and Roy Hamilton and the release of
the fall issue of The Southern Collegian were the two highlights
of the weekend. Twenty-eight of the freshmen polled were highly
impressed by the concert, three were not satisfied, and eleven did
not attend it at all. HKighty per cent of those intervied enjoyed
The Southern Collegian, ten per sent did not like it (usually because
they had seen better issues in the past, they indicated), and one
freshman had not seen the magazine.

Although fraternity parties had the best attendance, they were
not as well received as some of the other weekend activities. Those
students who saw the Olympics, who performed for the Friday
afternoon cocktail party at the Mayflower, and then for fraternity
engagements all day Saturday, thought they were “great.” The
rock-and-roll singing quartet was the only facet of the weekend

Current Literature In Review

 

‘The Names and Faces of Heroes’
A Collection of Tales Simply Told

By JAMES LEDBETTER

Reynolds Price, The Names and
Faces of Heroes, ($3.95)

Many will remember Reynolds
Price as the author of A Long and
Happy Life or for the lecture he
gave here last
year concerning
this prize-winning
first novel. The
volume now under
consideration is
his second ef-
fort, a book of
seven short stories
entitled The
Names and Faces
of Heroes. The
last of these
stories was pub-
lished in the final number of the
Shenandoah last year.

Unlike most young writers today,
Price writes simply and without
artificiality—but as any reader of
Hemingway knows, there is nothing
as complicated as simplicity. Price
tells his stories with simplicity, and
his themes are simple, in that they

 

Ledbetter

are timeless.
Maturation Themes

Price is especially sensitive to the
manner in which people grow up—
the way in which they mold them-
selves after a person they admire,
or their reaction when they discover
something about the world they
didn’t know before.

The title story tells of a search
for a hero; a young boy has been
told by his camp councellor that
he should select one, and he looks
hard without ever seeming to find
one—until he discovers that his fath-
er had been his hero all along. But
there is no sentimentality here; Mr.
Price knows very well the way a
boy can hate his father at the same
time he loves him.

Rosacoke’s First Appearance

Readers of A Long and Happy Life
will be pleasantly surprised at find-
ing the heroine of that novel, Rosa-
coke Mustian, in the first story, “A
Chain of Love.” In the strange empa-
thy Rosacoke feels for a boy whose
father is dying, and the way she
expresses it, we find her once again

the most enduring heroine we have
met in a long time.
“Uncle Grant”

My favorite—next to the title
story—is “Uncle Grant.” If you see
nothing heroic about a hired hand,
this story might change your mind.
Especially engaging is the direct
way in which this story is told—
Mr. Price uses his own name when
the characters are talking about him.
Throughout the book there is a
gradual development in style, which
becomes experimental in the last two
stories.

Mr. Price never sounds bitter,
though he has written a story that
is very contemporary in “Michael
Edgeton.” In this a boy at camp
meets, for the first time, his “new
father”—an experience that many
know first hand.

I find it hard to review a volume
of short stories—especially this one,
as the stories are so unaffected that
to say anything technical about them
would be hypocritical. I hope they
find some readers—especially on this
campus.

 

A View Of Campus Life

Freshmen - Are They Changing ?

conditions change along with the
times. The student body of Wash-

ington and Lee seems to be chang-

nity men to the independent is

another.

It occurred to me the other day
that an article on the supposed
“changing student body” might help
everyone including myself—some-
thing on the order of a “Know
Thyself” column. Seriously, I have
tried to interview people around
school who would have a perspec-
tive on the changing conditions here
and to assimilate their views in the
following column.

The big word both this year and
last during rush week was “this
year’s freshman class is really full
of fish.” The idea that this state-
ment rather unpicturesquely tries
to express is that the incoming
freshmen class has a larger per
cent of academically oriented stu-
dents. All this is very vague and
actually does little more than
make good, flammable conversa-
tion.

In search of some tangible evi-
dence, I dropped in on Dean Farrar.
He was eager to discuss the topic
and began by pointing out what we
have all heard, that the college board
scores and class rankings of the in-
coming students are now higher than
ever. He added, however, that this
may not actually be a valid scale
for change, since perhaps the stu-
dent’s attitude toward his school-
work is really the important factor.

“It is always a tendency,” Dean
Farrar pointed out, “to idealize the
past. I personally doubt whether
the bull sessions at the fraternity
houses and around campus have
changed a great deal since I was
here.” This point about always ideal-

Political Horizons

 

Liberalism: Values Individual Citizen,
Opposes Dogmatism, Seeks Adventure

Note: With this number the
Tuesday Edition begins a year-
long series concerning national
politics. On alternate Tuesdays the
liberal and conservative viewpoints
on selected issues, national and
international, will be presented.
Next week Wyatt Durrette and
Bill Braithwaite will present the
conservative philosophy.

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Liberalism is a belief in the
value of the human _ personality,
and a conviction
that the source of
all progress lies in
the free exercise
of individual en-
ergy. It cherishes
the democratic
faith that the av-
erage man is cap-
able of becoming
superior.

It is a spirit of
eagerness, part of
the American
Dream, for it encourages adventure
rather than security. It wishes to
make possible for all individuals and
groups to have the opportunity to
exercise their powers, so far as this
can be done without injury to others.

 

Harrington

Liberalism recogniges the revo-
lutionary changes that occur in

the modern world, and regards as
elemental common _ sense the
awareness that solutions of former
decades will not necessarily prove
adequate today. As it opposed dog-
matism in religion and morals in
the 19th Century, so it now op-
poses dogmatism in economics and
polities,

It therefore involves a readiness to
use the power of the State for the
purpose of creating the conditions
within which individual liberty can
thrive—of preventing abuses of
power—of affording to every citizen
the means of acquiring mastery of
his own capacities—of establishing
to every citizen a real equality of
opportunity.

Liberalism believes that the remo-
val of age-old anxieties and fears
(as in social security programs) does
not weaken moral fibre, whereas the
defense of comfortable privilege does
precisely this.

It recognizes the insidious dan-
gers, in a large, wealthy and com-
plex nation, of bureaucracy, mo-
noply, the waste of natural re-
sources; but it is more concerned
with the waste of human beings
who, by the very size and imper-
sonality of forces in the modern
world, cannot live full lives.

A Liberal cannot rest so long as

38 million Americans are poor, 20
million Negroes endure discrimina-
tion, 6 million adults are unemploy-
ed.

He recognizes as the dangers of
Liberal faith the tendency to think
of people in groups (Labor, for ex-
ample, or the Negro); to rely so
completely upon governmental ac-
tion to produce a better world that
the reason for this reliance—the
growth of individuality—is forgotten.

Like the Conservative, the Lib-
eral cherishes the institutions that
have made America great, but he
tries to guard himself against the
tendency to preserve a status quo
by which only “we” benefit, and
to imagine nostalgically that, in a
swiftly moving world, we can go
back to some happier condition of
earlier days. He tries to see the
difference between fundamental
principles and practical policies,
asking in each situation, “What is
indispensable?”

Liberty is a spiritual activity; it
can best be preserved by means of
new acquisitions of liberty and op-
portunity. The men of the American

Revolution put their belief in free-
dom above their personal privilege;
they were not afraid to challenge
the existing order even thought it
had been for them a comfortable and
privileged order.

Coun Syuire:

By ADDISON BROCKENBROUGH

October 27, 1963
Sunday

I've noted with amusement re-
cent attempts by certain factions
within the student body to “revita-
lize” conventional dress.

They are afraid the tradition is
dying, so I understand, and wanted
to “enforce it more strongly.”

Maybe I’m mixed up on definition,
but I always thought you “enforced”
rules—not traditions. It seems to me
that nobody has bothered to say why
conventional dress is good, just that
it is traditional.

If they are going to regulate and
codify this “tradition”’—even to the
extent of specifying what color shirts
you can wear with a tie—conven-
tional dress won’t be much more
than a military uniform.

It could be the tradition is dying.
And if it is, the alternatives that
W&L students are faced with are
(1) giving up now and doing away
with the whole thing, (2) codifying
the “tradition” and for the sake of
honesty call it a rule instead, or (3)
trying to convey something of the
spirit of conventional dress—why it’s
worthwhile, why a man of Lee’s
calibre ever started it in the first
place .

Of course a positive approach
would be hard to effect and would
call for some serious critical thought
on conventional dress. Maybe that’s
too much to ask.

There’s the possibility, of course,
that a positive approach wouldn’t
work. But there’s a chance it would,
and this, it seems to me, justifies
trying.

I would like a concerted effort
made to inculcate the spirit of con-
ventional dress into entering stu-
dents. More explicitly, I’d like to
see reasons—specific ones—given as
to why it is a good thing. The mark
of distinction it lends to the campus,
the heightened formality of the
classroom atmosphere resulting from
the coat and tie, and, most import-
antly, the spirit of gentlemmanliness
which conventional dress symbolizes
are a few of the things that should
be stressed.

It might help, also, if the benefiits
of dressing as one pleases were
pointed out. Just what would the
campus be gaining by abolishing
conventional dress, as opposed to
what would be lost?

My guess is that it would be made
evident that the benefits of conven-
tional dress far outweight those of
free dress.

At any rate, I like the tradition
and believe there is a lot to be said
in its defense, and more to be ac-
complished by selling it to fresh-
men than by forcing it on them.

Wives of undergraduate and law

Tigers Narrowly Upset W&L's

2 Long Drives In

Closing Minutes}

Help H-S Humble 5-Star Generals

Two long fourth-quarter drives, highlighted by the passing

of Hampden-Sydney’s Whitey

Lapscomb and a disallowed

W&L inerception gave the Tigers a close 12-11 victory over

the visiting Generals Saturday,
two games. *

The disputed pass-play came with
Washington and Lee leading, 11-6,
late in the fourth quarter; Lipscomb,
who had engineering the first H-SC
scoring drive in that period, lofted
a long pass intended for Tiger end,
Kent Carter. Wé&lL’s defence ace,
Bill David, covering Carter, outleap-
ed his man and apparently came
down with a drive-stopping inter-
ception. The refree, however, gave
the pigskin to Carter who had fallen
on David and wrapped his arms
around the ball also.

Tigers Score Clincher

Five plays later the Tigers scored
the decisive TD on the quarterback’s
plunge from the one. A two point
conversion pass attempt was over-
shot, but the Generals’ final race
against the clock was unsuccessful,
as Coach McLaughlin’s charges suf-
fered their second loss in five games.

Hampden-Sydney received the
the kickoff and marched for six
quick first downs before the Gen-
eral defenses got adjusted and stop-
ped the drive. From that point the
game became somewhat of a defen-
sive contest. W&L initiated the scor-
ing as a result of a recovered fum-
ble by Henry Sackett on H-SC’s
34-yard line. Washington and Lee
then marched to the Tiger ten where
they were stopped, and after several
losing plays, Jim Crothers came in
to split the uprights with a 27-yard
field goal to give the Generals a
3-0 second quarter lead.

The W&L harriers continued their
winning ways at home with a 19-43
victory over Catholic University
Saturday before a fine Parents’
Weekend crowd.

 

Captain Andy Kilpatrick overcame | |
a 200-yard lead at the two-mile |'

mark and captured first place with a
time of 24:55 minutes. This was the
best time run this year, and only
about 15 second off the record set
by Mike Shanks two years ago.

Sophomore Rif O’Connor ran sec-
ond for the Generals with freshman
Bill Wildrick, sophomore Lee John-
son, and junior Bob Patton taking
the next three places. Over-all the
times were below par because of the
unusually hot, dry, October day.

Coach Miller commented that he
was pleased with the good team
performance and that sophomores
Scott Kennedy and Clyde Fochee,
who had been given a rest last week
because of injuries would be running
again this Saturday as the cross-
country men face American Univer-
sity in Washington. This will be
their first meet on the D.C. course
whic his about a mile shorter than

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer
Time is a precious commodity,
and the Washington and Lee soccer
team will agree with the old adage
as ten minutes made all the differ-
ence in the world to them. The Gen-
erals scored two goals in the two
five-minutes overtimes to take a
5-3 come-from-behind victory over
King College here Saturday before
the largest crowd ever to see a W&L
home soccer game.

King College scored first with 14
minutes left in the first quarter
when there was a mix-up in sig-
nals between goalie Tom Green and
one of the fullbacks. Green called
for the fullback to let the ball go,
but he did not and muffed the
kick. Jack Brown alertly recovered
the poor kick and booted it into the
nets .

Generals Tie It Up

W&L tied it up with 6:30 left in
the same period on the first of two
goals by the “Great Dane,” Preben
Berthelsen. He kicked it from the
left into the right corner. Wes Hor-
ner, Bruce Jackson and Tim Henry
did nice jobs in getting the ball to
him for the shot.

Midway in the second quarter
Green made a g”eat save as he slap-
ped the ball away from the goal,
but unfortunately for Green it gave
the losers a corner kick. Green had
no other alternative than to make
the save that way. Sam McCoy
kicked from the corner, and Brian
Walter headed it in with 10:22 left.

The Generals tied it with 1:30 left
in the half when Chris Clarke drove
in a penalty kick from 10 yards out.

The winners lost a goal in the third
period when King fullback Howard
Bivens made a great play on a direct
kick from 13 yards when the goalie
was caught out of position.

Freshman Soccer
Team Bows, 3-1

By MARC WINSTON
Tuesday Sports Writer

Yesterday afternoon the W&L
freshman soccer team journeyed to
Charlottesville only to meet defeat
at the hands of the Cavayearlings by
a score of three to one.

Virginia led at halftime, one to
nothing, by virture of a_ penalty
goal. A W&L player had been guilty
of using his hands in the penalty
area. In the third period U.Va. in-
creased their lead to two to nothing.
The score came when U. Va. was
awarded a penalty kick because a
W&L player had shielded the goalie.
W&L broke into the scoring column
in the third period on a goal by
McGehee with an assist from Brad
Schinkel. U. Va. added a goal in
the fourth period and that ended the
scoring.

There were two major factors in
the U.Va. victory. One was the W&L
defensive mistakes which resulted in
the two Virginia penalty shots. The
other was the superior overall speed

corner.

W&L lost another goal before ty-
ing the game. Henry’s head shot hit
the bar at the top of the nets after
Berthelsen had set him up with a
perfect pass. But Berthelsen was not
discouraged. With 7:44 left the Great
Dane gave Dave Kirkpatrick a per-
fect pass directly in front of the
goal and the little sparkplug booted
it by goalie John Neill.

The Generals had two more
chances to win before the overtime,
but luck wasn’t with them. Hor-
ner’s shot hit the top of the goal,
and Jackson’s shot just missed
catching the corner of the nets.

The winners wasted little time in
the overtime as Jackson scored with
55 seconds left in the first period
from 15 yards. Jackson got his goal
when he gained control of a loose
bounding ball directly in front of
the nets. They almost got another
before the end of the period s
Neill made a great save on Pete
Preston’s attempt. Neill batted the
sinking ball over the goal.

Berthelsen added an insurance
score with 5:11 left in the second
overtime on a penalty shot.

Light Brigade
Drubs Eagles;
Defense Good

By GORDON GAY
Tuesday Sports Writer

Led by quarterback Bryant Ken-
drick and a determined defensive
unit, the freshman Brigadier Gen-
erals defeated Bridgewater JV, 14-0,
last Friday on Wilson Field.

A large crowd of parents and
Turkey-trotting freshmen saw a
close, hard-hitting game, filled with
fumbles by both teams. The first
Washington and Lee score came in
the second period on a 20-yard pass
from Kendrick to Hank Hendrick-
son in the end zone. The play was
set up by an eleven-yard pickup
on a quarterback sneak by Ken-
drick on a third-and eight situation.
Bob Reading added the extra point
and the score was 7-0.

Fine Defense

In the second half the fine defen-
sive play of Warren Stuart, Bob
Reading and Logie, Bullitt, defen-
sive tackles, plus the efforts of line-
backers Bill Sledge and Chuck
Staples, allowed only one first down
and 30 yards for a game total of
44 yards total offense by Bridge-
water.

The final score was set up by a
40 yard punt return by Phil Claxton
to the Bridgewater 14-yard line,
where John Bogart bulled his way
to the one. Kendrick then scored
on a quarterback sneak. After a
penalty nullified the first extra point
try, Reading calmly booted another
extra point from the 17-yard line.

Line Praised

Coach Swan singled out the de-
fensive line for their fine perfor-
mance as well as backs Rodger Red-
man, Jim Oram, and John Graham.
Swan said, “The team worked hard
all week in practice and it showed
up in the game.”

The Brigadiers have an open date
this week and they play Randolph-
Macon Academy on November 9.

Student Searching For Change

Finds Everything

(Continued from page 2)
izing what was before is important
to consider, especially when you
realize that (perhaps a wee tiny
bit erroneously) W&L’s reputation
in the past as a training ground for
A.A. All-Stars has been puffed up.

“After the war the boys that
came back were naturally very
serious about doing their work,
but they were hardly any better
informed than our students now,”
said the dean of admissions, In-
stead of an actual change in the
student, he seemed to feel that the
school had changed. He pointed
out that the school was harder;
it was easier to flunk out; and
once out, it was almost impossible
to get into another good school.

He felt that all these things were
impressed on the students today
and that they reacted by putting
more time into their studies. The

Later in the same period with
H-SC driving again on the General
25-yard line, fine play by Wé&L’s
defensive linemen, Jim Silvester,
John Anthony, and Buck Ogilvie
dropped the Tigers for several long
losses. With third and 29, Anthony
jarred the passer, Lipscomb, just as
he was about to throw the ball,
Ogilvie picked off the free ball and
ran untouched 50 yards to paydirt.
Sackett added the two-point conver-
sion with an end-run to give Wash-
ington and Lee an 11-0 half time
edge.

In the third quarter, the Generals
mounted several long drives but each
time failed to succeed in scoring.
Lipscomb began H-SC’s first drive
late in the third period, after having
one potential thrust thwarted when
David picked off a Tiger aerial in
the endzone and ra nit to the Gener-
al’s own 40 yard line.

curriculum is simply not allowing
“party boys” to develop.

With caution Dean Farrar added,
“Let’s not forget though, that seri-
ousnes does not necessarily mean
parking over a cup of coffee and
discussing Camus until two o’clock
in the morning.” C’est vrai.

On confronting Dr. Leyburn with
the problem, I found that he was
much in agreement with Dean Far-
rar as to this topic. He remarked
again on the seriousness of the post-
war students, but honestly felt that
the students seemed the same as
far as intellectual pursuits went.
The standard of work has improved
and accordingly, the student has im-
proved his work.

When Dr. Leyburn got around to
commenting that even the articles
and issues in the Ring-tum Phi have
not changed much with the years,
I thought it time to leave. It was
important though, to note how the
views of Dr. Leyburn and Dean
Farrar coincided on this subject.

Bill Noell complained upon be-
ing approached that his almost
three and one-half years here
hardly gave him the perspective
to discuss a topic on a changing
student body. He was not lack-
ing of thoughts on the subject
though. He said that he felt that
there was a change in the com-
plexion of Freshmen Classes the
school was getting now. This plus
the added pressure of the higher
academic standards was changing
the outlook of the whole student
body. It was a combination of the
two forces.

“I believe that pereentage wise

there are an increasingly greater
number of boys in the Freshman
Class that can carry on an intellect-
ual discussion. Of course, they may
hesitate to, but they have the abil-
ity.”
So that is how the interviews went.
I attempted to comment personally,
but remembering the hesitancy even
“the authorities” showed, I had bet-
ter get back to the intellectual bull
sessions on B.V. Becky and the
girls.

brought out their own argument.
They countered by saying that Jef-
ferson was similar to Lee. Eckes
maintained that Jefferson was re-
sponsible for the foundation of the
United States; therefore, if he were
to be tried, so would almost all
America. Clark brought out the
point that Jefferson was a peace-
maker, who had the ability to
change, and that his ideas would
be adaptable today, although Jeffer-
son would be critical of our pres-
ent system. The negative stressed
that Jefferson would be respected

Roger Paine. The students in the
combo are Erik Anderson, lead sax-

Bill Ingles, rhythm guitar; and Jay

The Waysiders are Jim Ledbetter

and only began playing together last
January. Their taste in folk music
leans toward exciting songs with a
hard driving beat. Their reportoire
is drawn most from their own re-

Ledbetter has written a few of their

all present wives and those coming to

No such benefit has been offered
to incoming students’ wives in the
past and they have had to rely either
on friends already here, or on the
“hit and miss” basis, to determine
which merchants they wished to
patronize.

Mixed opinions about several
stores were one of the results of the
survey. At present, the concern is
to make any final booklet an objec-
tive and fair summary of the relative
merits of those business concerns
dealt with in the poll. Mrs. Paine
hopes that the final booklet can be
distributed through the office of Mr.
H. L. Ravenhort, who directs the

dents who wish to live at Hillside

Percentage of Failures

When a mother asked the profes-
sors what percentage of freshmen
at W&L failed the English course,
they answered it was very small. Dr.
Coulling pointed out that at a large
state university, the percentage of
failures was from 30 to 35 per cent.
Providing a good part of the comic
relief for the evening, Dr. Coulling
concluded with an anecdote from
his own teaching experience: a stu-
dent of his at a state university was
arguing with him about a point of
grammar. Dr. Coulling finally ob-
jected to the student’s argument on
the basis that he had been teaching
the course for three years, and ought
to know what was right and what
was wrong. The student merely gave
him a deadpan look and replied:
“That's nothing—I've been taking
this course for six years.”

to receive unanimous approval.
Friday’s cocktail party and dance
drew eighteen of the forty-two
freshmen polled. The cocktail party
was widely enjoyed, but the dance
received the affection of only half of
the eighteen who attend it.

A question of a more general na-
ture was asked: “Did you enjoy the
weekend as a whole?” Thirty-two
said they did, while ten were not
so pleased with it. Twenty-six of
the total felt the weekend lived up
to their expectations, and sixteen
felt it did not.

During these interviews many
freshmen expressed the feeling that
either the weekend was what one
made of it, or else it was what one’s
date made of it. Most of the fresh-
men seemed to have spent an en-
joyable weekend—those who didn’t
were explicit in describing its faults.

... Looking Around...
(Continued from page 3)

a shame that with such a good and exciting wrestling team only
a relatively few people ever come to the matches.
This school is the only one in the south with more than
1,000 students and no band. The pep-band is terrific, but will
probably fold for lack of enthusiasm after this year. This is
something that will have to originate mostly from the adminis-
tration, but the W&L student has shown interest in such things
as debating and singing, why not try a band too???
You could probably find someone crazy (or drunk)
enough enough to dress up as a General and be a mascot dur-
ing W&L home contests. Granted, it’s harder to be a Gen-
eral than it would be to dress like a Tiger or a Bear, but it might
be worth trying.

HOW SMALL CAN YOU GET?

Today let us address ourselves to a question that has long rocked
and roiled the academic world: Is a student better off at a small
college than at a large college?

To answer this question it is necessary first to define terms.
What, exactly, do we mean by a small college? Well sir, some
say that in order to be called truly small, a college should have
an enrollment of not more than four students.

I surely have no quarrel with this statement; a four-student
college must unequivocally be called small. Indeed, I would
even call it intime if I knew what intime meant. But I submit
there is such a thing as being too small. Take, for instance, a
recent unfortunate event at Crimscott A and M.

Crimscott A and M, situated in a pleasant valley nestled
between Philadelphia and Salt Lake City, was founded by

emall allesé ?
A. and M. Crimscott, two brothers who left Ireland in 1625
to escape the potato famine of 1841. As a result of their fore-
sight, the Crimscott brothers never went without potatoes for
one single day of their lives—and mighty grateful they were!
One night, full of gratitude after a wholesome meal of French
fries, cottage fries, hash browns, and au gratin, they decided
to show their appreciation to this bountiful land of potatoes
by endowing a college. But their generosity contained one
stipulation: the enrollment of the college must never exceed
four students. They felt that only by keeping the school this
small could each student be assured of the personalized atten-
tion, the camaraderie, the esprit, that is all too often lacking in
larger institutions of higher learning.

Well sir, things went along swimmingly until one Saturday
a few years ago. On this day Crimscott had a football game
scheduled against Minnesota, its traditional rival. Football,
as you can well imagine, was something of a problem at Crim-
scott, what with only four undergraduates in the entire college.
It was easy enough to muster a backfield, but to find a good
line—or even a bad line—baffled some of the most resourceful
coaching minds in the nation.

Well sir, on the morning of the big game against Minnesota,
its traditional rival, a capricious fate dealt Crimscott a cruel
blow—in fact, four cruel blows. Sigafoos, the quarterback,
woke up that morning with an impacted incisor. Wrichards,
the slotback, flunked his taxidermy exam and was declared in-
eligible. Beerbohm-Tree, the wingback-tailback, got his neck-
tie caught in his espresso machine. Yuld, the fullback, was
stolen by gypsies.

Consequently, none of the Crimscott team showed up at the
football game, and Minnesota, its traditional rival, was able to
score almost at will. Crimscott was so cross after this humiliating
defeat that they immediately broke off football relations with
Minnesota, its tradtional rival. This later became known as
the Sacco-Vanzetti Case.

So you can see how only four students might be too meagre
an enrollment. The number that I personally favor is twenty.
Why? you ask. Because, I reply, when you have twenty
students and one of them opens a pack of Marlboro Cigarettes,
there are enough to go around for everybody, and no one has
to be deprived of Marlboro’s flavor, of Marlboro’s filter, of
Marlboro’s staunch and steadfast companionship, and as a
result you have a student body that is brimming with sweet
content and amity and harmony and concord and togetherness
and soft pack and Flip-Top box.

That’s why.
