Someone’s Trying To Dig Hazry’s Grave.

 

 

Randy Wootton

, KEN McGRAW
ae News Editor

Hairy’s grave is being dug. A res-
olution to withdraw University sup-
port from the Southern Collegian,
which would leave the popular pub-
lication $1200 in the red next year,
is presently before the Executive
Committee and will be acted on
shortly. The action was initiated by
Dean of Students, Edward C. At-
wood in response to alleged numer-
ous complaints from parents, alumni,
student’s dates and students.

At present, approximately one-
third of the money used to pub-
lish the Collegian comes from the
Student Activities Fee required of
all students. This is in accordance
with the constitution of the Univer-
sity which lists the Collegian as one
of the campus publications which is
to receive a part of ‘this fee.

The pending resolution is for an

 

,amendment to this constitution
which would remove the Collegian
from this list. Such action would
require a majority vote by the en-
tire student body if the E.C. ap-
proves the resolution and a two-
thirds vote if it does not. With or
without the E.C.’s approval, how-
ever, there is good reason to be-
lieve that students will be voting on
this matter sometime this spring.

Atwood’s Letter

In a letter to E.C. Chairman, Bill
Noell, Dean Atwood outlined his
opinion of the Southern Collegian.
He stated in the letter that over
the past few years he has been
asked repeatedly to justify the Uni-
versity’s sanction and financial sup-
port of the Collegian. He has found
justification impossible for this mag-
azine which serves no educational
purpose. He further points out that
“each issue is edited on a panic

 

basis and that the contents include |
materials of an off-color nature of-
ten bordering on obscenity.

Dean Attwood has made it clear,
however, that he is not seeking to
abolish the Collegian and that his
letter to the E.C. does not include
any such proposal. He has said that
he would not be against its publi-
cation as an independent student
enterprise, and his only reason for
initiating the proposed action was
that he could find no logical justifi-
eation for the use of the University’s
name in such a magazine.

Student Protest

Three weeks ago Randy Wootton,
Phi Delt senior, went before the
Publications Board with a_ similar
proposal which was independent of
the administration’s resolution. He
stated that, as a humor magazine for
the students alone, the Collegian

 

had a definite place on this campus.

Yet the Collegian is not restricted
to this campus alone but is “random-
ly distributed to whomever might
pick one up,” and thus it has a po-
tential readership much greater than
the student body.

The kind of humor enjoyed by
the majority of Wé&L students is, he
feels, offensive to a portion of its
readers who include some of the
parents of the girls who have come
here, students’ parents, and the
faculty.

The fact that the Collegian is a
sanctioned publication of the Uni-
versity reflects badly, he said on
the students here and on the admin-
istrative heads who not only sanc-
tion, but also support the Collegian’s
publication. Wootton made clear in
an interview yesterday, however,
that he is not trying to start a Puri-
tan campaign to clean up the Col-

Deadline for entries is April 10,
and all manuscripts must be submit-
ted to Payne 24. Decisions will be
reached early in May, and awards
will be announced on the June
commencement program.

Prose entries should ‘be interpre-
tive or imaginative: short stories,
critical studies, one-act or longer
plays, or informal essays. An ade-
quate bibliography and footnotes
must accompany criticism.

For a prose entry, a minimum of
1500 words is required. A collection
of shorter selections can be submit-
ted to total the minimum number of
words.

Poetry entries must consist of a
minimum of approximately 30 lines

Goldwyn Talk
Offers Little

To Listeners

A Review
By TOM PACE

Sam Goldwyn, Jr., the son of a
more famous father, was at Wash-
ington and Lee last week to deliver
a lecture. Along with him came: a
print of his latest film, “The Young
Lovers,” which was shown at a
sneak preview on Thursday night
before a representative group of
freeloading students and seemingly
eager, interested townspople and
faculty; and a short, nearly bald,
witty professor of English from the
University of Virginia who had
self-admittedly, penned the screen-
play for the movie.

 

Goldwyn’s lecture offered lit-
tle that most did not already
know, but he appeared both hon-
est and sincere which made one
look hopefully toward his movie—
in vain. He wanted, so he said, to
tell, honestly, a story of the prob-
lems which faced normal, solid,
stable youths in college today.
Yet he and his writer, George
Garret, managed to riddle the plot

GOP Primaries
May Result In
Surprise Ending

Condensed from an article by
J. BRUCE WHELIHAN
The final tally of the vote in

the New Hampshire presidential
preference primary may have more

‘| effect on the five announced Re-

publican presidential hopefuls than
political observers believe.

A heavy write-in vote is expect-
ed for Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge and Richard M. Nixon, who
have refused to declare themselves
candidates.

Nixon and Lodge

Nixon said that he would accept

a draft at the Republican National
cceuaiiies which will be held in
July in San Francisco. Sources close
to Ambassador Lodge, who is cur-
rently in South Viet Nam, say that
he will announce his candidacy soon.

According to a recent survey, the
Ambassador is the third most popu-
lar candidate with Republican vot-
ers in the Granite State. Senator
Barry Goldwater and Governor
Nelson Rockefeller are holding
down the number one and two
spots.

Advance in Lodge Popularity

An advance in Lodge popularity
has bene particularly noticeable in
the past week. During the same
period, Nixon’s popularity also has

climbed, but he has fallen into
fourth place.
Rockefeller and Goldwater have

both declined in popularity in the
past two weeks. Statistics indicate
that Rockefeller lost more support
than Goldwater.

A strong showing today in the
number of write-ins for Lodge
would indicate that an as yet unan-
nounced candidate might easily
walk off with the Republican party
nomination. This assumption will
seem even more valid if Goldwater
and Rockefeller register near the
same number of votes.

Delegates attending Washington
and Lee’s Mock Convention will
have only the final results of the
New Hampshire and _ Illinois pri-
maries to guide them. Only Senators
Goldwater and Smith are regis-
tered for the April 14 preference
poll in the Prairie State.

The Indiana and District of Co-
lumbia primaries will be held May
5, the second day of the Mock Con-
vention, too late to influence ballot-
ing.

 

*play April 17 from 8 to 10 p.m. in

Doremus Gymnasium.

Brubeck’s world travels under the
auspices of the State Department
have carried jazz, “the American
export,” to the far corners of the
world as a symbol of American free-
dom. Appearing on the cover of
Time magazine and featured in num-
erous musical publications, Brubeck
has a universal appeal.

A look at the list of Brubeck’s
recordings makes apparent the ver-
satility of his talent. In addition to
regular albums of standard jazz
tunes, there are such original al-
bums as “Time Out” and tthe latest,
“Time Changes” which are remov-
ed from the usual jazz style.

Each member of the Dave Brubeck
Quartet has won individual recog-
nition and is a soloist in his own
right. Paul Desmond, alto sax, Joe
Morello, drums, and Eugene Wright,
bass, combined with the piano of
Brubeck, create the distinctive style
characterized by the New York
Times as “the beat heard ’round the
world.”

As an important influence in mod-
ern jazz, Brubeck’s theory of con-
temporary jazz appeared in the mag-
azine section of the New York Times
following his extensive tour abroad.
Speaking of his reception in Europe,
Brubeck states: “There is no mis-
taking its effect; it arouses a kin-
ship among peoples; it affords them
flashes of recognition of common or-
igins, because of its basic relation-
ship to folk idioms. It is grasped by
the naive and the sophisticated alike.

A typical Brubeck concert is rela-
tively sedate and sophisticated, of-
fering a wide variety of musie within
Brubeck’s frame work. He offers
each one of the musicians in his
quartet an opportunity to prove his
adeptness. Ed Croft, president of
the Dance Board, has commented
that the contrast between Brubeck’s
Friday night coneert and the rock-
and-roll show scheduled for Satur-

day night, should make for plenty
of variety in the weekend.

The Mock Convention

Of all the mock conventions held by various colleges
across the country, W&L’s is one of the most respected.
This respect stems from the fact that through the years,
the leaders of our conventions have made certain that
when the balloting begins, it is based not on the emotion
of the moment or the personal preferences of the students
in a particular delegation, but on the actual political in-
clination of each state.

 

And so, we pride ourselves in the authenticity
of our convention—it is a record won by sincere
leadership and a lot of plain, hard work—but it
wouldn’t take many lackadaisical state delegation
chairmen to ruin it. Unless every one of these stu-
dents makes every possible effort to assess the po-
litical bent of his states, the balloting will possibly
turn into a complete farce.

Tonight New Hampshire will give us the first real
milestone in the GOP candidates’ campaign. It won’t tell
us everything, but we should learn something about the
actual force of Goldwater’s appeal, the campaign power
of Governor Rockefeller, and the potential discontent
with both these men, as shown by write-ins for Nixon and
Lodge.

State delegation chairmen must do more than read
newspapers and watch Huntley-Brinkley, though; let-
ters should be written to W&L alumni in all states, asking
for both financial support and their political judgment.
Chairmen of key states in particular must contact every
known Republican leader in their states to ask his opinion.

To make the problem even more difficult, it
is likely that the political attitudes of many of the
50 states will be fluctuating between now and
May. It will be dangerous and inaccurate, in some
cases, to vote in May on the basis of information
compiled in March. Thus, there must be contact
with key men in all states right up until the con-
vention, and then during the balloting itself.

The 1964 Mock Convention may be up against the
greatest challenge to authenticity ever faced by one of our
conventions—the professionals themselves can’t tell just
how the wind is blowing. Because of the uncertainty of
many states’ positions, the responsibility of the members
of the Steering Committee, the delegation chairmen, and
indeed, of every student, is to do everything possible to
be sure that our balloting in May reflects the genuine
attitude of the nation at that particular time.

 

Current Cinema

Entertainment Is Praised
In ‘Love With Stranger’

By BOB SCHAEFFER

Among the current reel-romances with titillating titles, “Love
with the Proper Stranger” succeeds in spite of itself because its
lurid subject matter supplies enough warmth and humor to over-
come a fairly pedestrian plot. This romantic comedy-drama com-
bines producer Alan J. Pakula and director Robert Mulligan, (the
“To Kill a Mockingbird” team) and these two seasoned toilers trans-
form a tenement melo-drama into an unlikely but pleasing fairy
tale.

 

Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen Featured
The princess is Natalie Wood, actually a salesgirl at Macy’s and
the prince-proper stranger is Steve McQueen, a struggling, some-
time musician who also isn’t ready to make love any more than
a sometime thing. Fortunately for the fairy godmother both are
from Italian-immigrant backgrounds, but unfortunately they meet
and experiment during a weekend in the Catskills.

After this one fall from grace our heroine finds herself in a
motherly way. They meet again—this time in Rocky’s (McQueen)
union hall and not just by chance. “I’m gonna have a baby,” Angie
(Wood) announces. “Congratulations,” offers Rocky. He agrees to
help her find a doctor, is rejected by his lady-in-waiting, Edie
Adams, and begins a pursuit which eventually winds up, naturally,
with love.

Abortion Attempted

During this chase we encounter the wicked witch, a despicable
midwife who is on hand to aid the abortionist in an almost suc-
sessful attempt to rid poor Angie of her malady. But this near act of
barbarian chicancery causes Rocky to rebel, and he agrees to marry
the lady in distress. Angie balks, insists she will marry only for love,
isolates herself from Rocky in an ivory tower, and proceeds to find
the right husband. Eventually Macy’s becomes the battlefield,
Chivalry and love conquer all and prince and princess unite before
a throng of peasants on the drawbridge to West thirty-fourth Street.
And since all’s well that ends well, presumably they lived happily
ever after.

“Love with the Proper Stranger,” like so many recent Hollywood
movies, is accentuated with a theme song, one of cinema’s more
regrettable habits. This particular tune plays precariously right in
the middle of a tender scene, which makes for an episode of more
nonsense.

But there are more than enough humorous incidents. Tom Bos-
ley, Angie’s sincere but extremely awkward suitor, provokes wit
upon whimsey, for every glimpse of Natalie sends him into cumber-
some, accident-prone traumas. Edie Adams co-stars sufficiently
and enhances the dialogue tremendously. “You’re a sex mainiac,”
she purrs promiscuously as McQueen ogles her thigh. And McQueen,
after fixing an intent eye on Natalie’s decolletage, passes up the
chance for love making the way most people pass up dessert.

Talent of Actors Evident

The real essence of “Love with the Proper Stranger” is Wood and
McQueen. These two pros, starring together for the first time, carry
the film through several slow spots with their superb talent. Besides,
they are very interesting people to watch.

The fact that New York City is the homefront and sole area

Disregarding Time magazine’s cos-
mopolitan tradition of never really
enjoying anything (be it book, movie,
or play), I must confess I really
liked the Troubadour’s presentation
of Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus.,

The play represents the struggle
of the learned, worldly Elizabethan
man to break with the sterile, intel-
lectual traditions of the Middle Ages.
Faustus, who has mastered all
learning, is not able to control his
ambition, and in his passion for
knowledge and power sells his
soul to the devil for twenty-four
years he squanders his powers on
erude jokes and women. Near the
end he realizes his mistake and
wants to repent, but it is too late,
and Faustus is trundled off to fire
and brimstone. The tragedy lies in
the fact that he is not damned be-
cause of a basically wicked soul but
because of his excessive Renaissance
infatuation with man’s potentiality.

Morton Shines

Tim Morton, playing Faustus,
brought a true feeling for the part.
Most distinguishing in his perform-
ance were his stage presence and
impeccable diction. Morton evident-
ly understood the self-confidence
and impetuosity inherent in his
role and quite obviously had the
ability and experience to bring it off
well. His lines dragged a little to-
wards the middle of the play but he

more than recovered by the last
scene. The “But One Bare Hour”
soliloquy was superb; good enough
to scare hell out of old Lucifer him-
self.

Playing against Morton in the role
of Mephistopheles was Steve Colvin.
Here Director Cecil Jones picked
another good man. Mephistopheles is
Satan’s right-hand man who _ has
the trying job of keeping Faustus
happy during his twenty-four year
spree. Colvin has both the mencing
voice and piercing eyes for the part,
and showed the uncanny ability to
create as much of an atmosphere by
merely being present on the stage—
silent and watching—than by say-
ing anything.

Hilarious Entertainment

The comic interludes between ser-
ious scenes (with a few exceptions)
came off very well. Lock Handley
as Robin and Lew Davis as Ralph
went together like Mutt and Jeff.
The audience enjoyed Handley’s
slap-stick facial expressions im-
mensely. Jeff Williams did a com-
petent job as Wagner, the hypocrite
servant of Faustus and Joe Volpe
managed some especially farsical
scenes as the horse dealer.

Although he only appeared in two
minor roles, it is unconceivable to
overlook the performance of Dr.
Keith Shillington. “Doc” was hilar-
ious as the fifth deadly sin, glut-
tony, despite obvious type casting.

There were of course, less compe-
tent performances, but nothing bad
or important enough in this cate-
gory to injure the play as a whole.
It is always a problem with Eliza-
bethan tragidies, and _ especially
Faustus, to coordinate the comic
scenes with the more central tragic
scenes. This remained somewhat of
a problem in the Troub production.

Sandra Dee in Disguise

Both director Jones and_ stage
manager Don Lineback deserve con-
gratulations for the stage layout and
props. The prop design was striking
and versatile. This important as-
pect is often neglected in the college
theater. Costumes were generally
suitable and—heaven forbid—actual-
ly looked like they had not been
used more than five times before.
The briefs under the devil’s cos-
tumes were conspicuously obvious,
but c’est la vie. The paramour of
Alexander the Great was another
Ursula Andress and Helen of Troy
had to have been Sandra Dee in dis-
guise.

It was interesting to note that
Latin mentor, Herman Taylor had
been called in to keep the “e’s”
hard and the “v’s” soft. He did a
good job.

In conclusion it was a highly en-
enjoyable production, well worth
both time and money spent. Fine
acting in the leading parts and able
direction made the difference.

 

Political Horizons

U.S. Seeks

By WYATT DURRETTE, JR.
Political Columnist

Many critics of the Administra-
tion’s foreign policy accuse it of in-
consistency, vac-
illation, and even,
in some cases, of
lacking a cohes-
ive, purposeful
strategy.

It is my sugges-
tion that this is
not the case; that
we have a stra-
tegy—a _ _ strategy
of detente born of
the “new epoch”
in the U.S.-Soviet
relations following the Cuban missle
crisis of October 1962.

Scholarly journals have recently
carried many articles dealing with
this subject. For instance, in an
article published in the Columbia
University Forum, Fall 1963, Dr.
Zbigniew Brzazinski wrote that, “if
the quiescent phrase endures, the
Soviet Union may eventually opt out
of the revolutionary game.... [It]
is therefore incumbent upon the
United States to adopt a posture of
peaceful engagement in order to

 

 

promote change in the Communist
world.”

Although Dr. Brzezincki recog-
nizes that “the Soviets remain
committed to the ideological war,”
and that the U.S. must maintain
its “military superiority,” and re-
main aware “of the dangers inher-
ent in the test ban,” he argues vig-
orously of “peaceful engagement.”

Specifically, he proposes that we
“invite a group of Russian officials
to sessions of Congress and pro-
pose in return that a body of Amer-
ican legislators sit in a session of
the Supreme Soviet.” We might
also, he suggests, organize a “youth
festival in America, and invite many
thousands of Russians to it.”

Although these suggestions are
unorthodox, the theme of the article
expresses, I believe, the tenor of
U.S. policy. I offer in my support
excerpts from a column in The New
York Times by foreign affairs colum-
nist C. L. Sulsberger, entitled,
“How Superpowers Seek Peace”:
“Without doubt, despite grave dif-
ferences between Washington and
Moscow on flamboyant issues, Amer-
ican opinion is being deliberately

Peace — Deliberately!

cultivated by a deliberate American
government.... To produce the
gradual change required for Amer-
ican acceptance of any major accord,
it is necessary to influence news.
That may be cynical; but it is true
and inferentially desirable.”

Suggesting that Washington and
Moscow “have warily embared on
unilateral but related moves to en-
courage ‘trust by mutual example,”
Mr. Sulzberger supports his conten-
tion with the following:

“Khrushchev made reduction of
defense budgets a _ precondition
for disarmament. McNamara sub-
sequently predicted ours would
‘level off and perhaps decline,’
citing Soviet flabbiness. President
Johnson cut the budget. On the
day this was revealed, the C.LA.
said Russia was an _ economic
swamp that, by inference, couldn't
spend more to defend itself.

“Khrushchev responded by prom-
ising to slice his military budget
and perhaps reduce force levels. Mr.
Johnson proclaimed a 25 per cent
cut-back in enriched uranium pro-
duction for warheads. A few days

The Revolution Of ’63

 

The Core of the Segregationists’ Creed:
Negroes Belong To The Inferior Breed

Editor’s Note: This is the second
in a series of articles by Dr. Louis
W. Hodges. The series was origi-
nally published in more complete
form by the Waynesboro News-
Virginian.

By LOUIS W. HODGES

The heart and core to the segrega-
tionist’s argument is now and has
always been the
racial myth, the
- assumption that
the Negro is in-
_ ferior because he
is a Negro. The
myth is a simple
one. It claims that
the Negro does
not reach as high
a level of achieve-
i » ment as the white

~ ‘because the Ne-
oe, nage gro belongs to an
inferior race. The Negro is thought
to be made of inferior stuff biolog-
ically speaking.

It is a fact, of course, in our cul-
ture that the general socio-economic
level of the Negro is below that of
the white. Per 1,000 population, for
example, the Negro bears more ille-
gitimate children than does the
white; he has a higher rate of illit-
eracy; he has a greater frequency of
physical deformity; he earns a low-

 

er per capita income. The racial
myth concludes that these facts are
explained by the simple truth that
the Negro is made of inferior mater-
ial.

Lack of Opportunity

Social scientists, however, have
long since explained the fact of
low attainment in terms not of bi-
ology but of the lack of opportuni-
ty by the Negro. For example, the
white has assumed that the Negro
is incapable of holding the higher
paying jobs and has thus excluded
him from them; he has assumed
that the Negro is not fully educable
and thus has not allowed equal
schools. The Negro’s inferiority,
claim social scientists, is thus not
that he is biologically lower but
that he has not been allowed oppor-
tunity to develop

But the logic of the social scientsit
does little, if anything, to remove the
racial myth. The follower of the
myth is ordinarily not adept at log-
ic anyway, and is surely not inclined
to be convinced by mere rationality.
The myth is in a state of decay for
other logical reasons. It goes like
this: More and more fields are be-
ing opened to the Negro; he is in-
creasingly being allowed to develop
his latent talents without artificial
hindrance from his society,

The result has been that he has
come to excel: Willie Mays in ath-
letics, Marian Anderson in the arts,
Ralph Bunche in government....
When dealt with as an individual
and not as a “Nigger” the black man
has shown competence at all levels
of our society, on the business end
of a broom as behind the execu-
tive’s desk.

Success of the Negro

The myth is being weakened by
the very success of the Negro. The
myth is being undermined not
through logic—though logie too
works against it—but through the
emotions, in subconscious rather
than conscious ways. Subtle and al-
most unconscious changes are effect-
ed in baseball-loving racist, for ex-
ample, when he admires the skill
of a Negro player.

This movement tends to “snow-
ball” and to gain momentum. The
more the Negro is allowed to enter
competitively into new fields, the
more pressure there is to open oth-
ers. So it is that the racial myth is
dying a natural, if reluctant, death.
The sophisticated have long recog-
nized the flaws in the myth; the un-
sophisticated are being pulled un-
consciously toward that recognition.
This too is part of the “Revolution
of 63.”

EC Meetings
Should Be Open
To Students

By LAMAR LAMB

Since I have been at Washington
and Lee, every year there has been
some discussion of a reorganization
of our student government with
an eye toward splitting the powers
of the Executive Committee. Some
have suggested creating a Student
Senate. The principle argument
against the present system is that
the EC, because of its quasi-secret
nature, is unable to adequately ful-
fill both the legislative and judicial
functions that it now has.

I have been unable to determine
whether this criticism is justified.
From my experience I have seen
that members of the EC are gen-
uinely concerned with fulfilling all
their duties with foresight and fair-
ness. And, I think it must be agreed,
the decisions so far have been rela-
tively good and just. Of course, there
have been mistakes, but any govern-
ing body is going to make mistakes.

What I have seen that disturbs
me is that, because the multiple
functions of the EC, members have
a certain isolation from their class-
mates. Many times, the EC has
had to make decisions without suf-
ficient reference to what the student
body at large thinks. There are sev-
eral reasons for this. One, I suppose,
is that fact that even the most con-
scientious Executive Committeeman
cannot assert student opinion be-
yond a superficial level.

Student Apathy

Another, more important, reason
is an apparent lack of interest on
the students’ part in the EC’s func-
tion. In my two years on the EC,
there have been very few students
who approached me about issues we
were discussing, partly because of
an understandable apathy, and part-
ly because of a hesitancy to discuss
the EC at all with its members. The
judicial function and its necessary
secrecy has isolated the EC from
student opinion on other matters.

When members of the EC do ask
other students what they think
should be done in certain legisla-
tive matters, they can ask only a
limited number of a few acquaint-
ances. Even in a school as small as
Washington and Lee, it is not hard
to see that this severely restricts the
possibility of a truly representative
government.

‘Structural Weakness’

The problem, then, can be seen to
be one of a certain in structural
weakness— the ignorance of the stu-

Letters

To The
Editor...

An Answer to Flournoy

Dear Editor:

The letter to the editor by Dan
Flournoy in the Friday edition of
the Ring-tum Phi does not neces-
sarily reflect the faculty or student
body’s views on integration. How-
ever as editor you are responsible
to your public.

The use of the press should never
be misused to misinform the public
or to formulate public opinions. It
is difficult to conceive that in the
age of modern missiles and efforts
of man to inhabit the moon that we
still have elements of this same so-
ciety living in the dark ages.

I have always thought of Wash-
ington and Lee as a cultural and
educational center, but if these opin-
ions of a student reflect attitudes
of your student body and faculty,
then Washington and Lee hag lost
its purpose as a light in the world
for the unlearned to become learned
men, and to teach that human dig-
nity is a just right of all people re-
gardless of race, creed, and religion.

 

 

 

 

The following points are answers
to Dan Flournoy’s ten point pro-
gram,

1, Negroes are not as anxious to
enter Washington and Lee as you
fear they are. There are many high-
er ranking universities that will ac-
cept them.

2. Negroes are familiar with your
“system” and also with fraternity
and combo parties. I should like to
introduce you to the Alpha Phi Al-
pha Fraternity.

3. I doubt if these choice Negroes
would want to date the neighbor-
ing girls. This relationship should
be kept to individual taste.

4. I think Washington and Lee
students should wear be-bop hats
and pegged pants because they
would certainly look better that way
than some I have seen parading up

Part I—WGL’s Forgotten Sports

 

Many Factors Attributed To Poo

As promised, this Tuesday’s Sports page takes great
pleasure in presenting Washington and Lee’s greatest un-
sung sport, pool, and the top billiard players in the Univer-
sity. This group of dedicated, courageous and hard-work-
ing young “gentlemen” carries on a centuries old sporting
tradition by maintaining a W&L Varsity Pool Team. After
weeks of research and work, the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
presents PART I—Unsung Sports. All Photos by Bill Young

By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor

For the last thirty-seven years, the Washington and Lee
varsity pocket-billiards team has gone through many brilliant
seasons, yet has gone virtually unnoticed and unpublicized
because of the 1927 faculty decision that recognition of a
pool team would destroy the “gentlemen-like” image of the
College. However, this team has been so sucecssful of late,
winning 38 consecutive team matches against the toughest
competition throughout the nation (Southern California,
Stanford, Miami, Slippery Rock, etc.) that the Tuesday sports
staff has decided to lift the censorship and feature the W&L
pool team.

This illustrious group, braving TB, (which is greatly en-
hanced by the smoke and chalk-filled ‘‘arenas” of competition)
broken thumbs and sabotaged cue-sticks has traveled many
miles week after week to further the University’s name at its
own expense (in competition, of course). In two years the
General sticksters have lost only two individual matches, both
as a result of underhandedness by the team’s opponents.

 

“Daddy Warbucks,” Louisiana Beatle,” and “Midget Wrestler, three bil-
liard team seniors sharpen their eyes for upcoming pool match.

Modestly self-acclaimed as the “‘greatest straight-pool play-
er at W&L” Hobby “Louisiana Beatle’? Morrison leads the
team as a co-captain and the leading money-winner. This KA
senior has been known to sink many unbelievable shots—those
others admittedly would not even attempt. The master of the
trick shot and his famed three-rail ‘“‘Leroy” shot, Morrison has
been acclaimed by the experts as ‘“‘the man to beat” in straight
pool.

Second to Morrison only in straight pool, Mac ‘Daddy
Warbucks’’ McNeace, is known primarily for his nine-ball and
one pocket play. As the other Co-captain of the W&L pool
squad, McNeace is known by his teammates as the expert
tactician and has been credited with winning matches with
both his cue-stick and his mouth. This shooter could, it has
been said, psyche out the Mona Lisa if she happened to have
a roll,

Tom “Cornbread Red” Corse is the most consistent mem-
ber of the team and, as a sophomore, has two more glorious
years on the team. The opposition is warned to beware of
Corse—he is one of those silent, uncomplaining types, yet
is known to be a mite sneaky, (often “forgets” to mark up

eye of both Jimmy Caras and Walter Clark, and this year
seems to be utilizing his special instruction.

Herb ‘“‘Midget Wrestler” Smith is the most violent member
of the five-man team. Smith has been known to take out his
frustrations, when and if behind in a match, on the “arena’s”
windows. Somewhat flashy, this blonde senior often carries his
grappling trophies to the pool matches and loosens up before
shooting by practicing ‘Granby rolls” on his competitor.

The team’s anchorman is Allen “Stoneface Ironman”’
Hubbard, another senior member of the fivesome. “Ace”’ has
the position of “most valuable” on the team because of his
ability to win with either end of the cue-stick (particularly
during speedy exits). Hubbard is the master at “‘accidentially”
wounding an opponent and, if this technique fails, he turns on
his devastating “Stoneface’’ stare to overcome his rival.

keeps the boys in shape as well as keeping their egos down

with his amazing playing ability, said to be “second to none’’
in Lexington. The team’s sponsors, instructors, cheerleaders,
and most avid fans are Mr. Walter Clark and his son, Dick.
Without these two W&L pool would have died-out many
years ago; and the members of the team indicated that they
base much of the squad’s success on the generosity and good-
ness of these two men .

A typical “artist of the
green cloth” has several very
essential qualities which pre-
pare him for competition. He
has an easy schedule enabling
him to practice at least six
hours a day; he has the “‘gift
of gab”; he cannot and will
not be “psyched-out’”; and,
finally, he must be either crude
and vulgar or sauve—depend-
ing on the competition. Team
members must also possess
amazing concentration which
will enable to device
new shots during even the
most interesting classes, and
all team members share the
same contempt for the “nov-
ices’ who horde the tables at

Sheffey. Newcomers to the tables include John “Airborne”
Cheatum, who will try to regain his form after a stay with
“Uncle Sam,” and Bobby “Wreck-A-Car” Culpepper a soph-
omore ace. With practice and the instruction of the Lexington
masters, these “‘possibles” will be able to continue the W&L

Lamb Advises Open EC Meetings

dent body as to just what the EC
is doing, and an inability of the var-
ious members of the EC to take a
poll on issues which confront them.
This is not necessarily catastrophic,
but at times it is unhealthy.

Since at times there is no practi-
cal remedy of the latter situation
(else we would have a Greek polis
and not a representative govern-
ment) perhaps something can be
done about the former.

In short, there is no reason why
legislative sessions of the EC should
not be open to all students. Two
years ago, these meetings were open-
ed to the members of the press, but
they have only sporadically sent re-
porters to the meetings. Students
still have very little idea of either
what the EC does or how well it
does it.

Matters of Interest

I have no illusions as how well at-
tended these meetings would be—
very few students would come. But

 

there are a few occasions when ser-
ious matters are being debated, and
it is at these times when both the
EC and the student body would
benefit from open meetings. People
interested in such things as the var-
ious committees’ functions, the prog-
ress of the Mock Convention, or
student body fund allocation would
greatly profit from attendance at
EC meetings. When debate on such
matters is scheduled, students could
be notified of time, so they could

come, observe, and perhaps con-
tribute from the floor.
This should in no way, however,

interfere with the secrecy of honor
trials, for obvious reasons. But there
is no reason why legislative meet-
ings should not be open to any stu-
dent who is interested in coming.
If nothing else it would help them
in knowing whom to vote for in
Spring elections—they would be
more thoroughly acquainted with
both issues and abilities and opin-
ions of members of the EC.

later he offered a ‘negotiated freeze’

On the other hand, we find in a

strategic parity would serve as a

necessary step toward strategic
supremacy.”
Different policy goals must

inevitably be the products of these
divergent analyses. The goal of those
who share the first and in whose
breast “hope springs eternal” is to
seek a workable relationship be-
tween communism and the free
world that will preserve peace in
a “world safe for diversity.”

Contrast the goal proceeding
from the second—victory over
communism through concerted po-
litical, economic, psychological, and
subversive efforts. A global stategy
designed to diminish the Soviet
power base and challenge com-
munist aggressions on all fronts.
To these men peace without vic-
tory is a dangerous illusion,

It is in this context that the spe-
cific proposals, or lack of them,
from aspirants for public office
from both parties take on meaning
and must be understood.

legian, but is only citing the detri-
ment that the publication in its
present state has been to the name

Editor Defends Collegian

The attempt to remove the school’s
support from the Collegian, however,
is expected to be unpopular with
the student body. Collegian editor,
Tain Tompkins, who, as a member
of the Publications Board, has been
aware for some time of the endang-
ered position in which the Collegian
has been put, spoke up in favor of
the publication when interviewed
yesterday.

Tompkins admitted that Dean At-
wood’s criticisms were excellent and
that Wootton had a point, but said,
“I wouldn’t undertake to edit it if
I didn’t think it was worth defend-
ing.’ He stated that he could not
disagree with some of the criticisms
but was strongly opposed to this
action which would possibly mean
the end of the Collegian.

To bring an end to the Collegian,
he said, would be bringing to an
end the most popular of the campus
publications. He pointed out that
the Collegian ranks as one of the
oldest and most famous college hu-
mor magazines, and despite present
events, is enthusiastically accepted
by the substantial majority of stu-
dents,

would be forced to rely on subserip-

it a sanction to collect as it does
now. Whether it will survive or not
is ultimately, according to Tomp-
kins, a test of popularity.

with every major cliche imagin-

At his lecture, someone asked Mr.
Goldwyn who was responsible for
the photography in his picture. He
said, in effect, that the final re-
sponsibility was his, but that often
such decisions were left to tthe di-
rector of photography. As the pho-
tography was really the only nice
thing about the film I feel quite
safe in assuming the credit for this
goes to the director of photography
and not to Mr. Goldwyn. Despite
his unusually good intentions, the
feeling that one has on leaving the

film is that Mr. Goldwyn lacks
imagination, talent, and insight. As
for Mr. Garrett, he should be
ashamed.

With Easter vacation already flashing the “Walk” sign, why not
decide before you go home on your number one suit and the rest of
your wardrobe. Aside from the traditional dress-up holiday, there
may be decisive interviews for either a summer job or a permanent
one if you're a graduating senior—-and the clothes you wear—plus
the way that you wear them—make the pivotal first impression.
You want it to be right at first sight, so, let’s take a run-down on
what you might well select this Spring in fashion.

YOUR NUMBER ONE SUIT for warmer

weather is next to weightless in the new lighter-
than-ever flannels and polyester/wool blends.
Color-wise, consider the more definite blues, the
new lighter greys; see the classic Glen Urquhart
or ‘glen’ plaids.

THE GIFT OF ‘GAB’ you get with the return of

natural tan gabardine. Its fine diagonal twill
weave and surface sheen make it an excellent
choice for your Number One Suit. Today’s gab-
ardines also come in lighter weight wools and
new polyester/wool blends.

 

PRIDE OF THE OUTFIT: REGIMENTAL

STRIPES ... the resurgence noted by ESQUIRE
last fall is gaining momentum for Regimental
Stripes—the traditional colors of the historic

oe British regiments. With scores of these famed
x oo regiments—like the Grenadier Guards, the
Royal Fusiliers, the Inskilling Dragoons—
there’s quite a roll-call of striking color com-
binations in pure silk repps for your selection.

DRESS SHIRTS—-SHOES—BELT . White Button Down Oxfords

are still very much de rigeur, and there are handsome variations in
narrow tape stripes of blue, grey, olive. Also, although you ‘can’t
go wrong’ with a white broadcloth tab collar dress shirt, why not
dress up with the newest pale tones of blue, olive or cream. With
suits in Blue or Grey, wear BLACK SHOES or the VERY DARK:
EST BROWNS...and RIB SOCKS are always smart and correct.
Your DRESS BELT is LEATHER with an important har ness- -type
buckle in polished metal.

AT THE SUMMIT—YOUR HAT... where the
decisions are made, it’s the narrow snap-brim
felt in brown or olive—welt edge, raw edge or
grosgrain-bound.

BIG SWEATER ON CAMPUS—THE CARDIGAN .... the button-

front coat-sweater is tops in campus popularity. Tops in favor are
the lofty Shetland and the open-knit Alpaca wool or wool blends in
solid colors or stripes.

BEACH- eounO! Should your vacation find you beached around

Ft. Lauderdale or Bermuda, say, then sports-
wear moves into number one spot. Here you'll
see a lot of TIGER—the bold, tawny color that’s
getting the roar of approval from campus men
everywhere. They pick it up in sportshirts like
this, sweaters, ties, socks. Find it in sharp, solid
tones or mixed—for example, a houndstooth
sportcoat checked in Black and Tiger... and let
them see you “burning bright” in fashion.
