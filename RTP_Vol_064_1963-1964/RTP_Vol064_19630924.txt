Dicheie Meeting
Attended by 85

A record total of 85 students met
last night to learn about W&L’s de-
bate team and the new topic for
debate this year—Resolved: that the
federal government should guaran-
tee to all qualified high school grad-
uates the opportunity for a higher
education.

The high number of students who
attended last night’s meeting was en-
couraging to Mr. William Chaffin,
director of the Debate Team. At the
same meeting last year there were
67 students, and the year before
45 attended it. Chaffin estimated that
25 to 30 of the students last night
were upperclassmen.

The first varsity debate at David-
<on on October 11 and 12 will be the
earliest start the Debate Team has
had sinee Chaffin came to W&L
five vears ago. An all-freshman
icam will be sent to Wake Forest on
the last weekend in October.

Members of the Debate Team
have been studying the issue before
them since August. Jack Eure and

Slanted Seats, Air Conditioning

By CHARLES NEWMAN
Ass’t News Editor

Robert E. Lee Chapel, hidden for
the past year behind a construction
fence, was formally opened to the
publie in the first week of August.
Although the outward appearance
of the chapel is the same, there has
been extensive renovation on its in-
terior.

Great attention was paid to keep-
ing the Chapel as original as pos-
sible, while modernizing it, strength-
cning its baleonies, and in general
fire-proofing the interior.

The new electrical fixtures were
specially designed from the origin-
al fixtures. The pipe organ, which
has been silent since 1938, has been
restored to use.

men who chose deferred rush to two
things: the extra day in rush week,
which he said hurt the houses and

| added to the freshmen’s problems

of choosing between them, and what
he called the “changing outlook”
among freshmen.

With the relatively small pledge
class that many houses have, de-
ferred rush will take on added im-
portance. Because of the number of
freshmen going deferred even
though they hold fraternity bids,
Broaddus hopes to begin deferred
rush in two weeks rather than four.

IFC officers felt that rush week in
general went well and that it was
“cleaner” than last year. There were
only four reported cases in which
rush regulations were violated,
three of the cases involved ques-
tionable rushing tactics and the
fourth a violation on the part of a
freshman.

At present, 240 out of the class’s
338 freshmen have pledged a fratern-
ity. They are as follows:

A Keynote

The circumstances of the world are so variable, that
an irrevocable purpose or opinion is almost synony-

mous with a foolish one.
W. H. Seward

Today is not yesterday.—We ourselves change.—
How then, can our works and thoughts, if they are al-
ways to be the fittest, continue always the same.—
Change, indeed, is painful, yet ever needful.

—Thomas Carlyle

For the past ten years and more, Ring-tum Phi editors
and their associates have written editorials about the same,
basic problems. Most of these students have been careful to
avoid mere complaining; they have made some excellent pro-
posals, they have rendered some compelling arguments, and
they have offered some concrete evidence in support of their
ideas.

To our dismay, we have found that we shall be writing
editorials this year about these same problems. The thorny
issues of the past remain as the critical dilemmas of today.
Despite scores of student polls and hundreds of editorials, a
seemingly deaf ear has been leaned our way by those in a po-
sition to take action.

We say “seemingly deaf” because Washington and Lee’s
administrative officials and most of its faculty are very willing,
even anxious, to know of student opinion in all phases of
campus life. But it does not take many reactionary faculty
members to vote down a carefully studied and progressive
program.

The student body does not expect the faculty to cater to
its every whim, but problems such as those involving absence
regulations or those involved with our present grading system
cannot be called whims. These are two of the four or five
major issues which have concerned students at W&L for years.
We hope the faculty committee which has been studying a
more liberal cut proposal will indicate a decision which shows
that some consideration has been given to student desires.

But if tradition wins out again, those few professors who
have bogged down Washington and Lee in the past will do it
again. These men have heard our arguments before—many
times—so why should they listen to them again’ The first
week of each month will come, the faculty meetings will be
held, and they will cast their votes for the sacred status quo,
as they always have. And the thousands of words written and
spoken for progress will seem wasted once again.

But who knows. Perhaps if the arguments are spoken
again, perhaps if the hope of progress is instilled in our hearts
again, then perhaps the words of Seward and Carlyle will find
their way into some musty minds and the everlasting no will be
altered. In the hope that this might happen, we shall continue
to have an editorial column in 1963-64.

Why Not Summer School?

Why go to college for four years? Why not three, and then
on to graduate school? The pace of world events almost de-
mands that today’s students get their degrees without any delay.
Some students do want to finish their undergraduate work in
three years; others want to get in some additional courses which
they could not take during the regular term. And other stu-
dents just flunk required courses.

The answer for all these situations is summer school. Over
sixty students from the School of Arts and Sciences alone went
to school last summer; it might have been more if it weren’t
so difficult to find a school with suitable academic standards
for summer work.

There has been talk in the past few years among the faculty
and the students about the chance for a summer session at
Washington and Lee. The law school does it, so why not have
the undergraduate school follow suit. A summer in Lexington
need not be as dull as it sounds at first: women could be ad-
mitted for the summer session only, and they could be housed
in the dorms adjacent to the Commons.

We realize that a suggestion such as this rocks W&L’s tra-
ditionalists completely out of their chairs. But is it such a bad
idea? The opportunity for a top-notch education, unlimited
social opportunities, and the scenic merits of the Shenandoah
Valley all lumped into one package is rather inviting. W&L
would have no trouble getting the necessary applicants with
those features highlighting the menu.

At the same time, W&L would have to accept the fact that
those students who attended summer school here but were not
regular term students could not be assimilated into the W&L
way of life. In order to offer a good summer session here, we
would have to waive some of our time-honored traditions in
favor of just plain education, no trimmings. But every school
which has a summer session must make that same sacrifice; why
can’t we?

Our honor system could be maintained to some degree in
the summer by the simple threat that any student found cheat-
ing would be dropped from the role. Coats and ties would be
too warm in July and August anyway, so that tradition could
be relaxed during the summer session.

In short, W&L would be itself in name only during a
summer session, but at least it would be that. None of the pro-

‘A Remarkahle Film’

 

 

Pace Showers Praises

By TOM PACE

The major difficulty in translat-
ing the novel “Lolita” to the screen
lay in the latter medium’s inherent
inability to take full advantage of
the brilliantly comic passages in the
book. The film’s director, Stanley
Kubrick, has done the next best
thing. He hired Vladmir Nabokov to
write the screenplay. Nabokov, rec-
ognizing his problem, solved it by
writing a somewhat different story
for the movie. His primary change
is adding three years to Lolita’s age,
and thus enhancing the comic possi-
bilities of the plot.

Humbert Humbert comes to
America from Europe. He decides
to take residence at the home of
Charlotte Hayes and her daughter,
Delores, because of Mrs. Hayes’
delicious cherry pies. He quickly
becomes fascinated with Delores,
called Lolita by her more inti-
mate friends. Quilty enters, exits,
Mrs. Hayes sends Lolita to camp
and becomes Mrs. Humbert. Mrs.
Humbert dies and Mr. Humbert
goes to camp. Humbert protects
Lolita. Lolita protects Humbert.
They are happy. Quilty enters,
exits. Lolita and her step-father
go to the mid-west where Quilty
enters, exits again and where
Humbert becomes less happy.
They go further west and Quilty
enters and exits once more, this
time taking Lolita. Quilty dies
violently, Sad ending.

Some of you may mistakenly
think that “Lolita” is meant to be
a serious drama. If so, you will be
mistaken. It is serious comedy, or
that which treats a serious subject
comically. Kubrick and Nabokov
have done remarkably well. “Lolita”
is treated with an aura of sophisti-
cation that even French directions
would be proud of. Kubrick care-
fully avoids any display of sex. For
example, when Humbert has picked
up Lolita from camp and they are
driving back, she says, “I didn’t
miss you; but it deesn’t matter. You
don’t care.” Humbert is surprised,
“What do you mean? Of course
I care. I eare very much.” Lolita
replies, “No you don’t.” And Hum-
bert, “What makes you say that?”
And Lolita, “Well, you haven’t even
kissed me yet.” No matter what
Humbert’s reaction is, it will appear
awkward. So Kubrick brilliantly
cuts to a shot of the car roaring
excitedly down a hill. The next
morning at the hotel Lolita gets out
of bed and walks over to Humbert’s
cot. They talk a little and then she
says, “What time is it?”

“It's time for breakfast.”

“No, I don’t want to eat break-
fast.”

“Oh. Well, What do you want?”

No audible answer as she bends
down and whispers in his ear.
Then a repeat of the shot of the
car. But this time the car is go-
ing slower; not excitedly, but con-
tentedly. Kubrick cautiously avoids
what might be labeled smutty
lines and lurid scenes by simply
making the mood one of comedy,
He keeps this up throughout. His
tempo is amazing. He rarely al-
lows a scene to rest on the screen.
He lets each scene build to the
height of hilarity, and then cuts
quickly to another which often
proves to be equally as funny.

I am able to find nothing but
praise for this film. Peter Sellers as
Quilty, and Shelly Winters as Char-
lotte Hayes are as good as you

could hope. And James Mason as
Humbert and Sue Lyon as Lolita
are both excellent. Mason is a stud-
ied actor whose use of hands, facial
expressions, and voice inflections al-
ways command attention and always
seem right. Lyon appears to be a
natural actress, if such a_ thing
exists. Even the musical score is|
superb. Nelson Riddle seems almost |
as clever as Nabokov.
Still, most of the accolades must!
belong to Kubrick and Nabokov. !

Coun Syuire

ADDISON L. BROCKENBROUGH

Sept. 12, 1963
Thursday

The freshmen got back from
Natural Bridge today, and I got
the chance to meet a young mem-
ber of the Class of ’67 named Mike
Newman. He was from the West—
East Orange, Idaho—and he real-
ly didn’t know too much about
what was going on. He was a
sharp-looking guy, and I could
tell he would get into a good fra-
ternity if he wanted to join one.
He said he felt comfortable go-
ing into Rush Week because it
seemed that he must already have
friends at W&IL. from all the mail
he got during the summer.

I asked Mike if he was confused
about which houses to see, and he
said a little bit, but he thought
everything would come out well
enough. The fraternity men would
be in the dorms to make dates
that night. I figured he wasn’t as
sure of himself as he let on.

Sept. 14, 1963
Saturday

While walking through the
freshman guad this morning I
saw my new-found friend Mike
Newman standing near the end
of a line of about 30 other fresh-
men. I asked what the attraction
was, and he told me it was the
IFC phone. Why did he need to
use the IFC phone? To call up the
house he had doubled up on
Thursday night. Mike’s date card
attested to his inability to tell
any fraternity “no” on Thursday
night. It’s especially hard, he said,
when there are eight men from
some house standing around your
room waiting for you to sign up.

Sept. 15, 1963
Sunday

Mike was a couple of pews up
from me in church this morning,
but when I saw him after the ser-
vice, I could tell he hadn’t got-
ten much out of it. He popped an-
other couple of aspirins into his
mouth as we walked down the
steps, shook hands with the min-
ister, and headed up toward the
freshman dorm. He was sluggish,
but willing to talk about the first
two days of rush. He had seen
four houses Saturday, but the
only one he had really impressed
with was Tappa Tag. He had seen
that on the last date. Who did he
remember from that date? Well—
he had had a few beers earlier in
the day, and he didn’t remember
too many of the guys, but that
Gail Stevens and the Brenda Bry-
ant were two of the sharpest
chicks he had ever seen. He had
talked with them for a long time.
What about the guys in the house?
Well—the Furshlugginger fellow

 

‘Another Country’ Views

Racial Issue

ANOTHER COUNTRY
By James Baldwin

By JAMES F. LEDBETTER

At a literal level, it would seem
that James Baldwin, the young Ne-
gro essayist and novelist who has
received a kind of national notorie-
ty of late, is trying to answer the
perennial question that pops up in
any bull-session about integration
in his latest best-seller: “Yea, but
what if your sister went out with
one?” And on a more serious level,
this is exactly what Baldwin is con-
cerned with; love—and sex—be-
tween the darks and whites.

Baldwin has shown us in his es-
says that he understands, and lives,
the complexities of the racial issue.
He is suspicious of the white lib-
eral, mainly because he has seen
him prowl the streets of Harlem
looking for Negro women; and ulti-|
mately, this is the way Baldwin sees
the whole problem—through — the
looking glass of sex. For it is here
that people are really themselves
and all the pretentions are stripped

 

On ‘Lolita’
They are looking at America with |
European eyes and have satirized|
brilliantly many of our failings. I
am not alone in my praise. Esquire,
Saturday Review, Sight and Sound,
and Newsweek all named it as one
of the two finest American produc-
tions of last year. To know you
have laughed more at a movie than
ever before, and yet to be moved by
its near-tragic element is a remark-
able thing. Accordingly, “Lolita” is
a remarkable film.

anything, but what difference did

ternoon. Apparently he’s already
made up his mind which house
he’s going to join. He’s had a lot
of fun both times he has been up
to the Tappa Keg house, and he’s
gotten to know those two girls he
mentioned real well. Even had a
chance to dance with them last
night, he said—some of the boys
in the house just happened to be
able to play some instruments,
and they had a regular party. He
brushed me off after a couple of
minutes, though, because he had
a list in his hand of freshmen he
was to see who were still on the

Sept. 21, 1963
Saturday

All the fraternities pledged to-
day, so I guess Mike Newman has
that pin in his lapel by now. I’m
quite sure that he doesn’t know
more than four or five members of
the house he has pledged, but I
suppose he’ll turn out well eneugh.
The only thing that really disap-
pointed me about him, or maybe
about the rushing system, was his
mention yesterday about dirty
rushing. It seems the house he de-
cided to join asked him to dirty
rush certain other houses that
were the same boys Tappa Keg
wanted. It wouldn’t look so bad,
you see, if freshmen were dirty
rushing their classmates.

Through Sex

away; where people
they hurt each other.

wonder why

In order to explore the issue ful-
ly, Baldwin devises almost every
posible form of inter-racial, and
inter-sexual, sex contact. If the
eight main characters are arranged
diagrammatically as to who slept
with whom, an unbroken cross is
formed. Married love and its pitfalls,
love between mixed couples both
ways, homosexual love, and extra-

marital love are all encountered.
Baldwin must be congratulated on
accomplishing all this with such

astonishing economy of characters.
He is obviously experienced in these
matters; but the descriptions of
homosexual encounters are a little
sickening despite their accuracy.

What is the meaning of this? Does
a large perspective result from all
this bedroom English to teach us
something about love or about sex
or about race problems? It must be
admitted that this reviewer was a
little bewildered by the panoply of
events. The title seems to come
from what is perhaps the most-
quoted sentence of this century,
taken from Marlowe’s The Jew of
Malta: “Thou hast committed forni-
cation; but that was in another
country, and besides, the wench is
dead.”

But where the other country stood
for the relativity of modern morals
in Hemingway and Eliot, it seems
to have a different meaning for
Baldwin; the other country of love,
where people can go to hide their
troubles until they are summoned
back to—Greenwich village.

Frankly, Baldwin writes much
better when he stays in the village.
His description of a typical men’s
room is so evocative that the read-
er will have to take a walk in the
fresh air before continuing.

The main criticism this reviewer
has of Baldwin’s style is that despite
his knowledge of how people think,
make love, and relieve themselves,
he has no idea of how they talk. The
dialogue is atrocious, and what is
worse, people grin while they say
things, something which seems
physically impossible. “‘Let’s go to
bed,’ grinned Vivaldo,’ sounds like
a swiffie joke.

Despite this, Another Country is
recommended to the liberal of
mind—and the strong of stomach.

Ann Arbor, Mich,—(I.P.)—The

small college should resist the pres-
sures of trying to be everything to
everybody, says Alan O. Pfnister,
University of Michigan associate
professor of higher education.

“It can resist these pressures by
seeking to b edistinctive, offering
a limited number of majors, and
working at some depth in these,”
he says. “Making use of the other
simplified channels of communi-
cation possible, it can keep the
entire faculty and student body
informed and stimulated. It does
not face some of the problems that
a larger institution faces because
of the sheer magnitude and com-
plexity of its operation.”
Professor Pfnister points out, “The
small college can also exploit the
sense of community. It can work
closely with the students if it wants
to do so. However, it cannot assume
that because it is smail the proper
relation between faculty and stu-
dents will obtain.”

The small college can dare to be
different, he emphasizes. “With the

Coach Lee McLaughlin says his 1963 Washington and
Lee football squad could have the best overall depth of any
team he has coached in his seven years with the Generals.

That may sound like so much tall talk to McLaughlin’s op-
posing coaches, most of whom can count three and four con-

secutive losses to W&L because of the Generals’ long suit—

Soccer’s Returnees; Injuries Key

By TOM CARPENTER

Injuries appear to be the key to
a successful soccer season for Coach
Joe Lyles’ men this year. One or
two injured starters could cause
disaster for the club as reserves are
at a premium.

Coach Lyles is very satisfied with
his front line players and has praise
for the reserves that he has, but he

i} has a valid complaint that he has a

shortage of manpower. As of now
Lyles is counting on only 15 players

‘|for the opening game against Pfeif-

sophomore Dave Kirkpatrick are
having a spirited battle for an op-
ening day assignment.

Two All-Staters will be on the
forward wall in Tim Henry, the
talented sophomore from Bermuda,
and Jim Mell, one of the co-captains.
The third man will be underrated
Steve Hibbard.

The other inside position goes to
Chris Clarke, who is back after a
three-year layoff.

The halfbacks will be Bruce Jack-
son, another All-Stater, and another
sophomore, Wes Horner.

Why Not Summer School?

(Continued from page 2)

posals would change W&L as we know it now during the regu-
lar school year. A University such as ours is more than a set

of classrooms—it is a way of |

ife; but as it is now, W&L is

even less than a set of classrooms during the summer.

Education is sorely needed t

hese days, and facilities such as

those at W&L are invaluable—so much so that we should not

allow them to lie fallow for a

fourth of every year. We are

aware of the fact that administration officials do not favor
this idea; we would like to know how the student body feels.

 

Soccer Team In Opener Thursday

(Continued from page 3)

At fullback will be Pete Preston,
Dave Redmond, and Claiburne
Darden. All-State goalie Tom Green
returns to protect the nets.

The reserves are Howard Busse,
Preben Berthesolen, and Ed Warn-
er. Berthesolen, a foreign exchange
student from Denmark, showed well
in Sunday’s 6-1 triumph over the
freshmen with two goals. Warner
played fullback last year, but has
been moved to halfback to make
full use of his speed.

Last year the Generals finished
third in the state with a 9-3-2 record.
The University of Virginia took top
honors with Lynchburg College fin-
ishing second. Lyles is hopeful that
his club can replace Virginia in the
top spot this season. He commented
that to succeed Virginia the team
will need sharper passing than has

He also emphasized a need for more
conditioning. He has been pleased
with the hustle and spirit displayed
in practice.

The freshman team, coached by
Bob Lathrop, impressed Lyles in the
three varsity-freshman scrimmages.
Three of the moys may be promoted
to the varsity to boost the bench
strength. Fullbacks Bill Skinner and
Bill Fisher along with wing Brad
Shankle have caught the attention
of the varsity coach. Lyles is hope-
ful that he does not have to add
them to his roster because he feels
that the boys will profit more from

They will probably remain on

a teaching career is demonstrated,
candidates in mathematics or the
natural sciences may also be con-
sidered.

A Fellow receives $1,800 for the
year’s study, plus dependency al-
lowances; the Foundation also pays
tuition and fees.

All seniors who are interested
inconsidering a career in college
teaching are urged to discuss the
fellowships at their earliest con-
venience with their major profes-
sors and with Dean Pusey, who is
Campus Representative for the
Woodrow Wilson Fellowships. The
deadline for nominations is Octob-
er 31, 1963.

Dr. Pusey stated that 21 Wash-
ington and Lee men have received
Wilson Fellowships in past years. He
stressed both the generous finan-
cial support which the fellowships
afford and their great prestige val-
ue. In addition to the recipients of
the awards, he added, many candi-
dates receive honorable mention,
which frequently leads to financial
assistance from other sources.

Looking ahead, the society plans
