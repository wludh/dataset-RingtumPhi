Noted economist Dr. David Mc-
Cord Wright spoke in Lee Chapel
yesterday on “The Social Idea Be-
hind Full Employment.”

Wright, who presently teaches at
the University of Georgia, spoke to
a nearly full auditorium. He is con-
servative in his economic thought

He ascribed unemployment in
America today to the slow rate of
economic growth. This low rate in
turn Wright charged largely to the
entrenched pressure groups of both
labor and management, which have
consistently resisted the changes
necessary for progress.

The “major factor” behind full
employment, said Wright, is “mo-
bility of resources,’ which means
continual change in means of pro-
duction and in consumption pat-
terns.

“Complete disruption of the entire
social structure” may be necessary
for change, Wright pointed out. He
compared this phenomenon as_ it
happens in capitalistic and in social-
ist countries and stated that the
socialists have not solved the prob-
lem any better than has the United
States. There is insecurity under so-
cialism just as under capitalism;
commissars can be replaced.

The next factor nesded for
gress, McCord said, is a favorable
attitude on the part of the people.
If they are not willing to undergo
changes, there can be no progress.
The ultimate disease in an economic
system is “growing unwillingness to
run risks and submit to change.”
Progress cannot continue without
constant discomfort for many peo-
Pie. “This,” said _Wright, “is the

UCA Initiates Service Project

By CHARLIE FLIPPEN

The University Christian Associa-
tion is forming a committee of stu-
dents which will work with patients
at Western State Mental Institute.

One group has already been to the
hospital, and another group tenta-
tively plans to go this Sunday.

Two Programs

The committee has two specific
programs which it plans to imple-
ment at the hospital.

Under one program, the members
will go over in groups of five or six.
Hach group will work with some
20 to 30 patients.

“The men at the

Bob Scheelen,
“For

The second program will be on an
individual basis. Each student will
find a person he is particularly in-
terested in. He will talk to him and
perhaps later he will be able to take
him to town.

Regular Visits

The organization is now trying to
establish regular times for the group
visits. “We would like to get a reg-
ular group for Sunday, and if pos-
sible, another regular group during
the week. This way the men could
come to expect us at a certain time
every week,” Scheelen, a sophomore,
said,

At the moment the committee's
major problem is transportation.
“Only a couple of the boys have
ears and this could make getting
back and forth a difficulty,” Schee-

len said.

“Anyone who has a car and would
be interested in helping should con-
tact me,” he said.

There is also plenty of room for
ether volunteers. Approximately 25
or 30 boys have shown an interest
in working on the committee. “But
there about 2,500 patients at the
hospital. The possibilities for
are unlimited,” Scheelen said.

The UCA first started working at
Western State late last semester.
that time they only attempted the
group program.

The hospital itself is greatly un-
derstaffed, Scheelen said. The com-
mittee service is therefore a real
aid.

Dr. Luther Hodges, faculty advi-
sor to the UCA, commenting on the
program said that it was an expres-
sion of the social service function
of the association,

“The main thing about the pro-
gram is that it affords the men there
virtually their only contact with the
outside world.

“At the same time it brings us into
contact with another world, too,” he
said.

Mutual Benefits

Echoing Hodges’ opinion Scheelen
said “It benefits both them and us.”

“We help them as much as pos-
sible. And at the same time we hope
to help ourselves to mature, to get
|a broader outlook and_ perhaps,
stabilize our own personalities.”

 

This committee is one of a num-
ber of semi-independent committees
functioning under the UCA.

Economist Wright Discusses
US Unemployment Problem

 

seamy side of the case for capital-
ism; but on the other hand it is a
prerequisite for the progress we val-
ue.”

Wright said that present United
States policies are unlikely to cor-
rect our economic problems. U.S.
policies are unlikely to correct our
economic problems. U.S. prices are
much out of line with those of the
rest of the world, he charged, and
U.S. productivity is too low. He at-
tacked a tax cut, calling it “il-
lusionary” and stating that saving
“will not be very great.”

Wright spoke under the auspices
of the Visiting Scholars Program of
the University Center in Virginia.
One of America’s most respected
economists, he is the author of The
Creation of Purchasing Power and
The Economics of Disturbance.

 

Dorm Petitioners

Denied Request

Two occupants of the upperclass
dormitories initiated a petition last
week requesting administration ap-
proval for the privilege of having
female guests in Baker and Davis
dormitories.

Maurice Fliess and Grayson Pow-
ell, W&L sophomores, got up a pe-
tition signed by forty-three occu-
pants of the two dormitories. There
are only seventy-nine occupants in
both dorms, a large number of whom
are law students. The petition con-

 

sisted only of undergraduate sig-
natures.

This petition was presented to the
Administration which met and dis-
cussed the petition on two different
eccasions. After considerable discus-
sion, the Committee concluded that:
“While the members of the Admin-
istrative Committee sympathized
with the reasons motivating the re-
quest, they were unwilling to rec-
ommend such a change at this time.’

Problems discussed included the
fact that the dormitory rooms are
bedrooms, freshmen and _fraterni-
ties are not allowed to have girls in
their bedrooms, and an added bur-
den was placed on dormitory coun-
selors.

Also, it was felt that local girls
schools would be somewhat upset
about the potential consequences.

NOTICE

There will be a meeting of non-
fraternity freshmen for the purpose
of interviewing both Stuart Fine-
stone and Bryant Kendrick, fresh-
men EC candidates from the Pro-
gressive and University parties re-
spectively.

The meeting will be held at 7:00,
Sunday night, in Room 27 of the
Student Union building. All Inde-
pendent freshmen are urged to at-
tend, in order to meet both candi-
dates, and to vote for the one you

 

 

consider the best qualified.

Openin ¢ Dances

The first school-wide social function for the 1963-64 dance

" season begins this afternoon with the Openings Cocktail

Party. This party is given in honor of John Moore, a member
of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. Moore is President of both
Openings Dance Weekend and the sophomore class.

‘Collegian’
Appears Sat.

The South's most justifiably ma-
ligned magazine is probably appear-
ing on schedule, latest reports pro-
nounce. The Southern Collegian

.| covers steamed into the print shop

in the arms of a giant teamster on
Saturday morning, and the first
phase of printing was all completed
by noon. Barring some other prema-
ture calamity the finished product
will be distributed next Saturday to
a number of locations, possibly in-
cluding the Student Union if Federal
troops choose not to intervene.

An interview with the elusive
staff yielded little information as
to the character of their creation.
In answer to allegations that the
Collegian was one of the more can-
cerous publications currently ap-
pearing on American campuses, Edi-
tor-in-Chief Tompkins admitted that
it probably was “the most outstand-
ing literary tumor ever harbored by
a university organism,” but that a
biopsy of those involved would re-
veal that they are, as a matter of
record, essentially benign and never
malignant. In any event, he avowed,
there was little danger that the Col-
legian would get any bigger after
the forthcoming issue. It might, in
fact, be excised from the student
corpus entirely, suggested one of
the printers, who said that it was the
first Collegian in a year to foul the
machinery with what, in his opinion,
looked like hairs.

The staff is entirely and solely
representative of the student body
and their whims and foibles, accord-
ing to its leader, and is an order of
mystics, not subversives. Hope was
expressed that the more occult is-
sue this weekend would not offend
anyone. Famously devoted to pre-
senting a personalized brand of hu-
mor to the campuses of the Old
Dominion, the Collegian claims in-
nocense from all vices and is essen-
tially loyal to its parent institution,
spoke the Editor. He further an-
nounced that the theme of this hu-
morous Openings issue was therefore
“Make Frinds With Freshmen” be-
cause first, “in freshmen lies the
destiny of the Southern Collegian;
the future editor is in there some-
where,” and secondly, “they’re so
funny.”

As to his chances of maintaining
the editorship in the face of a more
conservative faculty, Tompkins
doubted he could be taken alive and
pictured his possible demise by re-
calling the tombstone inscription of
the Openings 1959 issue:

“The sun’s rim dips; the stars rush

out:

At one stride comes the dark...”
and further he hoped there’d be no
moaning of the Bar, he said, “when
we embark.”

Debating

 

cocktail party which begins at four
o'clock and continues until six in the
evening. The Pine Room of the May-
flower Motor Hotel will be the site
of the party.

The Olympics achieved fame with
two of their first recordings, “West-
ern Movies,” and “The Hully Gully.”
Recently two more of their songs
have reached the top of national
record polls. These are “The
Bounce,” and “Dancin’ Holiday.” The
Olympics have recently appeared on
numerous nation-wide tours. They
appeared in Red Square during Fin-
als of last year.

Openings Dance

Tonight, Lloyd Price and his big
band will be featured at the Open-
ings Dance. The theme of this year’s
dance, “An Arabian Night,” should
present a striking change from pre-
vious decorations and themes. The
dance figure, presenting the officers
of Openings Weekend and their dates
will take place at approximately
ten o'clock.

Openings Dance will begin at
nine in the evening and continue
until one in the morning. Doremus
Gymnasium will serve as the site
of the dance. Formal attire is to
be worn at the dance. Ed Croft,
President of the University Dance
Board, indicated that short formals
or cocktail dresses will be suitable
for the women .

Lloyd Price has a list of million-
selling records which can be topped
by only a few singers. Almost every-
one remembers his single releases of
“Stagger Lee,” and “Personality.”
However, his list hits continues
with “Where Were You on My Wed-
ding Day,” and “Laudy, Miss
Claudy.”

Price is presently spending most
of his professional time playing in
night clubs and in a series of one-
night stands.

Fraternity Parties

Following the revelry of Friday
night, and the misery of Saturday
classes, the weekend will start up
with renewed vigor Saturday after-
noon will see the beginning of fra-
ternity parties. Among the combos
featured at the various fraternities
will be the Olympics, the Zodiacs,
the Thornton Sisters, and the Little
Boys. Fraternity parties will also
be given following the night con-
cert.

Roy Hamilton is the attraction at
Saturday night’s Opening Concert.
Again Doremus Gymnasium will
serve as the auditorium. The Up-
setters Band of Little Richard fame,
will accompany Hamilton.

The concert will begin prompt-
ly at eight in the evening. Stu-
dents attending the concert are
reminded that conventional dress
is to be worn at the concert.

Teams Go Undefeated,

Capture First Place At Davidson

Washington and Lee debaters took
first place in the Davidson Invita-
tion Tournament last week end, go-
ing undefeated in ten matches.

There were ten schools present
at the meet, each entering an af-
firmative and a negative team. The
W&L affirmative team was compos-
ed of Sam Frazier and John MeMur-
ry, and the negative was argued
by Rick Kneipper and Ed Fitzgerald.
The four met and defeated all the
other nine schools at least once.

Duke University finished second
in the standings, having only two
losses; they were followed by the
University of North Carolina.

The perfect record marked the
first time in W&L debate history
that both teams went undefeated in
tournament competition. Of the four
debaters, all are sophomores and
only one, Fitzgerald, is a veteran in
debating. Kneipper has had some
experience, but it was the first ma-
jor tournament for both Frazier and

MeMurry.

 

Coming events on the debating
schedule include a trip to Bridge-
water on October 30 by an eight-
man team. There will be an all
Washington and Lee novice tourna-
ment on Tuesday, November 29, and
W&L will send a four-man team of
freshmen to Wake Forest in Novem-
ber for the annual novice tourna-
ment there.

The question debated was “Re-
solved: that the Federal govern-
ment should guarantee to all quali-
fied high school graduates, an op-
portunity for higher education.”
Other schools participating in the
tournament were Duke, North Car-
olina, Davidson, Randolph-Macon,
Carson-Newman, Gardner-Webb,
Lynchburg, Western Carolina, and
Wingate.

William Chaffin, debate coach,
commented that the sophomore de-
baters show as much promise now as
the championship team of Al Eckes
and Bill Noell did two years ago.

Can They Be Saved?

The University dances, much as we hate to admit it, might
well become a thing of the past. An occasion that once was the
focal point of the W&L big weekend is beginning to peter out;
it may like so many other things fall a victim of changing
times.

If this decline in interest in the University dances continues,
we have a problem: whether to do away with them altogether,
or modify them to suit the changing wants of the student body.

 

The primary objection to the dance sets is that they lack
the conviviality, the festivity, of a combo party. A great deal of
this criticism stems from the fact that alcoholic beverages are
forbidden at the dances, a situation arising out of the Univer-
sity rule against on-campus drinking. The only way this rule
could be amended in any way is through the trustees.

Hollins overcame this difficulty by having its dances off
the campus. The amount of alcoholic consumption is restricted
by limiting the number of “‘drinking tickets” one can pur-
chase. The glaring obstacle for W&L, however, is trying to
find an ideal off-campus location.

What we predict is that when the problem becomes acute
enough, the student body will petition the board of trustees
to amend the constitutional rule, in order to make dance sets
an exception to total prohibition. As it stands now, the need
for this change is increasingly obvious. “The W&L gentleman”
is being taxed beyond human limitations: he must keep his date
entertained for four hours; there is no breaking in to relieve
him. What makes it worse for him is being on the wagon while
most of the fraternity brothers are living it up in some less
formal, more scintillating environment. In this light, it will be
hard for us to expect students to continue attending these
dances merely out of University spirit.

A Full Immunity

Polio, once thought defeated through the use of Salk
vaccine has returned. In Petersburg, Virginia, fourteen cases
of polio have been reported in the last two months. This past
week the outbreak reached the critical stage. A new, and more
permanent vaccine, the Sabin oral vaccine, was rushed to the
city. Within two days, well over 100,000 people had received
their first dose of vacine. Taken orally, on sugar lumps, the
Sabin vaccine made it possible to vaccinate a large population,
easily, quickly, and painlessly.

This Sunday, October 20, W&L students, and the resi-
dents of Lexington will be given the opportunity to receive
the first of three such vaccine boosters. Administration of the
vaccine will take place at the Lexington High School, from
two to five in the afternoon. There is no charge for the vaccine.

It is the duty, and responsibility, of every student to pro-
tect himself from this dreaded disease. Very little effort is
needed; all it takes is a swallow.

The Monday Polls

Freshmen will be facing their first election polls on Mon-
day. One source of discomfort for them is the constant pres-
sure to vote straight party. This pressure is exerted when the
respective pledge classes are warned that individual qualifica-
tions of a candidate are secondary; what comes first is the
interest of the party.

We point out to the freshmen that regardless of what you
are told, straight-party voting is not the rule here; the results
of the past few years have shown an ever-growing trend toward
independent thinking. You will be deciding on Monday wheth-
er or not you will join the University in perpetuating this trend.

Our Weekend Hosts

This afternoon will see the first achievement of a noble
goal long pursued by some of Washington and Lee’s most
spirited reformers: sponsorship of a University Cocktail
Party by one of the classes; i.e., wholesale provision of rum
punch by sophomore class dues. The Mayflower Hotel will
be the site of the historic occasion, which will no doubt be at-
tended by all campus luminaries without exception. On hand to
carry on will be the Olympics.

So it will be truly an auspicious moment that marks the
lifting from individual fraternities the burden of alone paying
for a Cocktail Party. The sophomores have paid for this first
party, and now they are responsible for making sure that it is
a good one. Since there is no home football game this week-
end, the sophomores can put all their class spirit into this
one contest: they can lead the way in downing the opponent
(rum punch). The Cocktail Party will be followed by a dance

in the evening for those who recover.

Origin Of Openings Traced To 1876,

Hop’, Cotillion Clubs The Instigators

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Fall dances seem to have been
popular at W&L for almost a cen-
tury, but there has not always been
a fixed dance known as “Openings.” |
Our present form of Openings |

Dances is the result of a gradual}

evolution which is outlined below:

The first Calyx (1876) contains a|
paragraph about a “Fancy Dress |
Hop,” held in October. This was not |
an annual affair however. By 1879, |
there was what was known as the
Hop Club, which had the onaeeate |
bility of giving a fall dance.

In 1897, the first year of the Ring- |
tum Phi’s publication, the paper an- |
nounced that “the Cotillion Club |

gave a very delightful hop on the/&

eighth (of October).” This is the first |

reference to the Cotillion Club, |

which was to play a major role in |

the development of Openings until |

it ceased to exist in the 1950's.
1908

In this year, the “Opening Hop”
featured, according to the Calyx, “a
large number of visiting young ladies
from Lynchburg, Richmond, and
Staunton.”

In the early part of the century,
dances in October were almost total-
ly obscured by fall football, which
weekly occupied the entire front
page of the Ring-tum Phi. Fall
dances still went on, but the only
published reference to the Opening
Hop in 1916 was a small, 6th page
article in the R-t P which stated that
VMI was lending facilities to W&L
for the dance.

1917

The influence of the Great War
was felt in the 1917 hop. The new
Doremus Gymnasium was decorated
with the national colors and VMI

In 1919, for the first time, the
Ring-tum Phi ran a small front
page article on the dance. “Es-
pecially interesting,” announced the
paper, “were the ‘jazzations’ of the
drummer, whose work on the traps
and general demeanor on the plat-
form was enough to stop the dance
and attract myriads around him.”

   

ingredients of OPENINGS—1963

1925

Opening Hop was on October 17
and was informal, the music being
furnished by the now-defunct
“Southern Collegians.” Freshmen
were required to wear green bow
ties to the hop and could only stay
an hour unless they had dates or
were on the freshman football squad.

 

Communism, Conservatism
Base Ideology On Economy

By “Official Logician”
Reprinted from The Russian
Conservative

This is an inquiry into the nature
of man, although it does not con-
sider all men, deals with only a
superficial view of man, and is not
really an inquiry but a flat propa-
ganda statement. (Is student leader
raking self over coals?) Can the
Communist be a conservative? Is
there a place for a Communist in
the conservative movement, besides
those already there? I think there is
definitely a place for the Commun-

ist in the present conservative
movement, but first, a resort to
terminology.

What then is a “Communist”—and
a conservative—and how may one
man be both, without being schizo-
phrenic? Basically the Communist
must acknowledge himself to be a
Marx-made man and seek to follow
that political action which can best
serve his ends. Basically the Com-
munist believes that the material as-
pects of life, economic factors in
particular, are at the foundation of
all ideas and thus all cultural

 

achievement. As is revealed in the
life and teachings of Karl Marx,
“it is not the consciousness of men
which determines their existence,
but, on the contrary, it is their so-
cial existence which determines
their consciousness.”

And from Ameriea we learn that
the conservative “is interested in
maintaining a political order which
encourages man to realize the fullest
expresion of his individual talents.
He supports a capitalistic econo-
nomie system, subject to controls
against corruption, because he be-
lieves it best allows man’s fullest
expression and fulfillment.’ (Don
Partington, Southern Conservative,
page 4.)

Thus the strongest link between
the communist and the conserva-
tive is their common belief that the
determination of man’s ethics, mor-
als, and achievements is controlled
by economics. Communist and con-
servative alike recognize that man
after the Fall (of the Russian Czar
in 1917 when he was banished from
the palace by a burning sickle) does
not and is not influenced by ideas

 

Passed Out Teenage Idol

Serves As A

By DREW BAUR
Once upon a time (about a year
ago) in

a small, dirty, poorly lighted,
stuffy town there
| was a large, dirty,

poorly lighted,
stuffy building
with unoriginal
drawings on the
walls. A_ large
group of people

were gathered in
this room await-
ing the appear-
ance of the exalt-
ed one. Many of
the people were
standing round dreaming of the re-
placement of Al Jolson, Red Nichols,
and Louis Armstrong all combined.
The others were aimlessly wander-
ing around (almost as thought intox-
icated) wondering when the new
god of music would appear. Outside
in his big Cadillac the teenage idol
of adolescent America was passed
out.

 

Muttering menacing words the res-
tive crowd began to slowly leave
the large, dirty, poorly lighted, stuf-
fy building and filter into the smaller
buildings located nearer to the heart
of town. They were met in these

 

 

smaller buildings by the blaring of

Reminder

a huge jukebox, hidden in the far
corner of the room, pretending to
be a combo. It didn’t really fool the
other occupants of the building as
most of them were in much the
same shape as their idol in the big,
beige Cadillac. The mysterious rul-
ers of a powerful minority in the
town had previously decreed from
their hill hangout that on this par-
ticular night, all jukeboxes would
pose as combos. The result was an
unfortunate occasion for all involved,
except the top drawer entertain-
ment on the floor of the big, beige
Cadillac.
Moral; none, just a reminder.
IFC

All fraternities owe IFC president
Art Broaddus a vote of thanks for
his prompt action on Christmas
house parties. The IFC has finally
elected a responsible leader who
commands the respect of both facul-
ty and fraternities. Hopefully all
houses will obey the rules of the
IFC for the Christmas parties and
give Broaddus the support he de-
serves.

BEST BETS FOR THE WEEK-
END. Mizzou by two touchdowns,
Susquehanna by two points, a small
group at the Sunday magic show,
and Johnny Walker on the rocks,

outside the realm of the political
and material. And government, and
thus law, is only a political device
“to subordinate power to generally
approved purposes and ideas.” (Don
Partington, Southern Conservative,
page 4.)

The good Communist following the
“Manifesto” as an inspired doctrine
can’t help but also be a conservative,
or at least better not help it. Can
the Communist be a Conservative?
Yes, Yes. (Except for Chinese, of
course.) Remember: NiKR-4-64.
(That’s Nikita Khrushchev not kry-
ton nickel.)

By REN MANNING

The trouble with a school such
as this is that everyone is always
trying to protect the really big,
the really important things that give
Washington and Lee its widespread
prestige. They want to make its
academic strength even stronger, its
spiritual life even more impressive,
and its reputation of turning out
gentlemen even more pronounced.
These are the things which impress
the onlookers, bring nostalgic
thought to the alumni, and dazzle
the genteel of Lexington.

O.K., Pll agree. This is fine. ’m
all for it.

But as I said earlier, there is
danger here. By concentrating on
all these big things, the school
often neglects the little things that
make the student’s life here worth-
while and full of meaning—like
soap in the heads.

There is never any soap in the
dorms. Only once have I seen a bar
of soap in the gym, and that was
a dirty, gritty, warped thing that
I would no more touch than eat.
How many times have you gone into
the washroom and washed your
hands only to find the paper towel
dispenser empty? How does one go
about drying them? Does he wipe
them on his clothes and run the
risk of people’s noticing that may-

1935

In 35 the traditional fall dance
was combined with Homecoming to
create the “Homecoming Dances.”
W&L played Virginia Tech, and
VMI played the Wahoos. The price
of the dance set was $2.50, and the
weekend featured Jelly Leftwich and
Band.

By 1936, the Ring-tum Phi finally
considered the fall dance news-
worthy enough to give it a page-
wide headline. As usual, the Cotil-
lion Club made the arrangements for
the weekend, whose cost has risen
to $5.50 per student. On the 16th
of October, the Sophomores gave
their dance, followed on the next
day by a football game with Ken-
tucky and a formal dance.

living is to be maintained, we must

Washington and Lee Football, Soccer Successful

By TOM CRENSHAW
Frday Sports Writer

This Friday Coach Lee McLaugh-
lin’s Washington and Lee Generals
take to the road for their first en-
counter on foreign soil. The Gen-
erals will travel to Selinsgrove, Pa.,
to meet formidable Sesquehenna, a |
team, which like W&L, takes fierce
pride in their win-loss record. Un-
til three weeks ago, Susquehanna
had been the proud holder’s of the
nation’s longest undefeated streak
(22 games). They had their string
broken opening day, but since then
they have bounced back strong and
deefated their next two opponents.

Undoubtedly this will be W&L’s
sternest test thus far this season,
and most likely it could be the
toughest of the year. As Coach Wil-
liams so aptly put it, “Gentlemen,
this is a football team.”

 

A record of 24 wins and 1 loss is!
a pretty impressive record for any ee
but it |#

team to carry with them,
shouldn’t frighten any of the Gener- ||

A

als from making the trip; it seems [

they have managed to taste a few
victories in the past three seasons,
31 out of 33 to be more precise.

Defense Problem

Washington and Lee will have to
find a way to bottle up the inside
running of Susquehenna’s Larry
Kerstetter, a fullback, who last
year gained 583 yards and managed
to strike for 74 points. If this were
not enough, Susquehanna offers two
more dandies in Larry Srdman, who
boasts an impressive 575 yards and
46 points to his last year’s credit,
and Don Green, who, while in be-

tween passing, found time to lug the
ball for 527 yards—an average of
7.4 yards per carry.

Not to be denied, however, is the
Generals’ fine running backfield di-
rected by Johnny McDaniel and
featuring Little All American can-

Fate Echols Seen As Bouncer

This being Openings Weekend,
any house in need of a bouncer

250 lbs. around at various social
functions. According to the socially
prominent Jeff Sheehan, our on-the-
spot North Shore reporter, Fate
is quite adept at wielding a rubber
hose drawn from the hip. It seems
Fate is the epitome of law and
order on the ballroom floor.

Lynchburg Colege Defeats W&L;
Booters Loose Second Straight

W&L’s booters went down to their
second straight one-goal defeat
Tuesday, at the hand of their old
rival Lynchburg College. Close all
the way, the game was undecided
until late in the final quarter when
L.C. made the critical score.

W&L got off to a fast start and
pressed during the entire first quart-
er, but were unable to crack Lynch-
burg’s “tight-back” defense. With
these two fullbacks drawn back, the
Generals’ loop passing game was
totally ineffective around the goal
mouth—especially since the ball was
only seen on rare occasions when a
breeze lifted the dust cloud from the
grassless dust waste of the field. At
one point, play stopped completely
while players searched for the “lost”
ball.

The second quarter was an unin-
spiring display of free kicking by

the halfbacks who sat back and un- ;

intentionally volleyed to one another
for at least two-thirds of the period.

The Generals’ defense actually
played an excellent game, with

Howie Buse leading the pack but
the forward line couldn’t do a thing.
With unfailing inaccuarcy the for-
ward lines of both teams tried to
mount offensive threats, but rarely
reached either end of the field.

The second half was extremely
reminiscent of the second period
except for various catcalls from the
Lynchburg bench and the increasing
pro-Lynchburg hillside fans. The
Lynchburg goal came on a right

Penalty Kick Decides Game

By REN MANNING

Friday Sports Writer
Claude Rodgers booted a penalty
kick untouched into the lower left
corner of the goal in the third
period for the only score of the
day to give the Washington and
Lee Freshmen their second straight

‘| victory of the season against one de-

feat. By defeating Lynchburg, they
squared matters with the team that
had handed them their first game
loss, 2-1.

Throughout the game, the visitors
worked a good offense to their
advantage to keep the freshmen
bottled up in their own territory,
unable even to make an offensive
effort. Lynchburg had every chance
to break the game wide open fre-

 

quently, but key saves by star goalie
Ward Briggs prevented a single
score. The few times W&L got the
ball, they either muffed the chance
to work the ball downfield or blew
an easy goal. Sloppy passing and
dribbling gave the visitors many
gifts and no threat to speak of.

In the second period Lynchburg
was given two golden opportunities
which they succeeded in returning
to the home team. A W&L foul gave
Lynchburg a penalty kick. Briggs
knocked down the attempt in a sen-
sational move to prevent the score
and the freshmen breathed a sigh
of relief. However, during the kick
a man had moved and they were
allowed another kick. Again Briggs

Welcome back to the halls of higher learning! And here we go,
with the 1963/64 series on correct dress and grooming geared to
you—to help you earn extra credits as the well-dressed man-about-

campus.

This season, the big topic is the return to tweed—rugged, textured,
and in a wide variety of patterns. Take tweed into account when
you’re picking out your sport jackets, and for a new suit to wear

on or off-campus, on weekends, or what you will!

RUNNING NECK AND NECK in the sweep-

stakes for tweed sport jackets are race-track
plaids, herringbones and diagonals. Race-track
patterns are found in strong, vigorous color
combinations like gold, amber and blue, while
the biggest thing in herringbone is bold
black-and-white or black-and-gray. Multicolor
diagonals come in heather tones with a muted,
misty effect. Even the ubiquitous blazer is
newly disguised in tweed, with broad—almost
awning—stripes in unusual and interesting
colors. Whatever you choose, your jacket still
sports its classic cut, straight-hanging, with

natural shoulders, center vent
closure.

 

and 3-button

THE CAMELS ARE COMING—This rich, medium brown shade
will blend well with every other color in your wardrobe—so look
for camel color in sport jackets, cardigans, pullovers and zipper
jackets, among other things. You name it—you’ll find it in camel!

STRONG, STURDY CORDUROY is still the mainstay of the
campus wardrobe—especially in the newer, wider-wale weaves.
Sport jackets come equipped with the popular leather patches that
keep you from coming out-at-elbow while adding a smart touch.
Poth jackets and slacks will be in demand in the neutral, natural
tans, while olives are with us still. Or you might try the latest

corduroy—camel, what else?

VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF SLACKS—as long as the variety’s

confined to fabric. Cut remains trim and tapered, pleatless and
with a plain waistband. Real winners are worsteds with a smooth
finish, or wool-and-polyester blends with a flannel finish, Take a
look at both darker and intermediate tones—oxford grays, olives,
dark brown, as well as the middle mixtures—then make your com-
mand decision on the basis of the blend or contrast with your

jackets.

 

RIDING HIGH on campuses throughout the
country is the hi-riser shoe, now available in
smooth leathers like cordovan, as well as
brushed leathers. A good choice for all but the
most formal occasion—or the football field—is
the popular slip-on. The traditional moccasin is
the theme—and its variations are very nearly
unlimited! Grained leather slip-ons are new
for Fall, and watch particularly for grained
leathers in black. Equally smart is the wing-
tip, one of this season’s revivals.

TOP IT OFF WITH TWEEDS, T0G—now that

sport hats are being made of this fabric fa-
vorite! You can have a sport model hat with
pinch crown and narrow brim in a variety of
tweeds, as well as the regulation flat country

 

cap. If you'd rather concentrate on corduroy,

you can find plenty of hats to your taste—usually wide-wale, with
broad band and feather mount. So don’t overlook the multiple pos-
sibilities of the fabric hat for the sporting life!

Next month we'll turn the spotlight on tailored apparel, and give
you The Word on suits, topcoats and town-type accessories to tide

you over. See you then!

Modern Era Lacks Pattern;

Foils Student Of

By ROD COCKSHUTT

As a student of history I find it
revealing from time to time to look
retrospectively into the course of
human affairs to see how the con-
cerns and fears of the past are con-
tinually supplemented or replaced as
time goes by.

For instance, think with me for a
moment about the world situation
approximately a year ago today.
With our eyes and ears guled to
the television, radio, and the news-
papers, we watched and waited an-
xiously as the two greatest powers
in the world moved closer and clos-
er to a showdown which might
easily have led to the destruction
of this planet. Yes, we all remember
the Cuban Crisis.

For the first time really we are
faced with a most vivid example of
what terror there is inherent in our
age. Most of us felt helpless. All
of us were afraid. Hoarding was
common in many of our major cities;
college students left school and re-
turned home; air raid drills and
other civil defense measures were
meticulously practiced.

But the Cuban Crisis passed. And
with shudders of relief we returned
to our normal daily lives, only
temporarily shaken by the magni-
tude of what we had just experienc-
ed.

Today, a little less than a year
later, the climate has _ radically
changed. The Sino-Soviet rift, the
establishment of the “hot line,” the
partial nuclear test ban treaty, in-
creased cultural and commercial
relations between the West and the
Soviet bloc all point to the fact that
our world today is at least a very
transitory one.

Whether we are inclined to in-
terpret the changes in the world sit-
uation as a giant step toward ulti-
mate peace and_ reconciliation
among nations, or merely as a

History

hiatus in the inevitable death strug-
gle between Communism and the
West is of little matter to us here.
Again, history alone can be the final
judge of that.

Nor are we saying that when
crises occur we need not fret be-
cause nearly always they resolve
themselves and “things just seem to
work out fine.” Such a view is
naive and leads only to apathy and
ignorance.

Rather the point we are trying
to make is that the times in which
we live are extremely fluid. Histori-
cal patterns in international politics,
theology, philosophy, the arts, race
relations, and scientific research have
been shattered and there is little,
if anything, we can look upon today
as stable. An era such as this it
seems, must be prone to crisis.
As an individual and as a nation
we must attempt to move with the
times; not helplessly swept up by
the tide, but ever trying as best
we can to guide the course of events
along channels which will be ulti-
mately beneficial to mandkind.
Otherwise, we drown.

Play Teams Our Caliber
Way To Restore Spirit

Dear Sir:

On the front page of the Tuesday
edition, there was a rousing head-
line announcing something to the

effect of “SEMINARY GIRLS STIR
CROWD, TEAM ON TO VICTORY!”

Now maybe the girls from Sem
did stir the crowd and team, but
they sure didn’t have anything to do
with the victory. It is common
knowledge here that school spirit is
a farce. People come to games only
if there is nothing better to do and
even then wouldn’t think of en-
couraging the team for fear of being
considered some sort of gung-ho
fanatic (and they are perfectly
right... they would be).

Everyone knows that the students
usually couldn’t care less about the
team, but has anyone stopped to
ask why? It is true tht spectator
spirit is generated by an intense,
if temporary, hatred of the op-
ponent. How then can anyone be-
come enthused over annihilating
some team that he feels sorry for?
How can anyone with a sense of
humanity and a clear conscience
help but feel a twinge of pity for
the hapless, scurvy ball clubs that
the W&L football machine annually
destroys?

The answer to our dilemma is
this: play teams that at least have
a chance of beating us or even
(Heaven Forbid!) where we might
have some probability of actually
losing! Why not try to get in, for
instance, the Southern Conference?
None of the teams in that organi-
zation are powers, and if we lose

 

more games, we will at least be put-
ting forth a more worthwhile ef-
fort, and what’s more important,
the spectators will be able to cheer
the team on without an overbear-
ing feeling of guilt and foolishness.

1942

Despite the poor student support
in 1941 and a resulting Dance Board
Deficit of $387.15, not to mention
wartime restrictions, Openings was
held as usual, featuring Bobby
Byrne and the VMI Commanders.
From 1943 to 1946, Openings were
not held.

In 1946, Openings came back to
life with the pre-war type dance.

In October, 1947, only a_ short
time before the scheduled Open-
ings, the Ring-tum Phi ran_ this
headline: BROOKS CANCELS
OPENINGS SET DATE... Emer-
gency Committee Considers Harvey,
Sherwood, Chester. The Dance
Board had received a last minute
telegram from Randy Brooks an-
nouncing his’ cancellation. The
Dance Board finally came through
with Bob Chester’s band; however,
the Openings Dances was late that
year... November 21 and 22.

By 1950, except for the demise of
the Cotillion Club and the substitu-
tion of the concert for the Sopho-
more Prom, the evolution of Open-
ings was complete.

as well, of course, for a chance to
improve their season record.

The up and coming “training
break” will also be better if there
is something to celebrate. Last year.
the Generals beat VPI, but only after
a hard fought first half in which
W&L again started very slowly.

Attendance will hopefully be good

proved equal to the task in prevent-
ing a score. This seemed to give
W&L new life as they showed better
ball control before the half ended.

In the third period Claude Rodgers
cashed in on his attempt of a pen-
alty kick and that was the entire
W&L offense as they were able to
tighten up their defense throughout
the rest of the game to preserve the
1-0 victory.

The victory was a big one though,
as Lynchburg College played their
JV team with many varsity play-
ers on it. Defense was the keynote
in the win, with Briggs, Terry Her-
man, Claude Rodgers, and Brad
Shinkle playing top roles. Next
