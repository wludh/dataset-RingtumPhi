‘Firebugs’ Biting Allegory
Of Businessman’s Stereotype

Our generation was born in the time of war. We have a dark memory
of some evil shadow, but we were not immediately conscious of it. We
read about it now in textbooks and see those Chaplinesque movies about
the little man with the bug on his upper lip. But is it merely textbook
material or farce? Can we pass it off as a mistake? As something curiously
foreign in the “American Way”?

 

 

The Firebugs is a warning against such a stupid and complacent
belief. The play is a point to point allegory of an ordinary business-
man ensnared in his guilt, unable to make a moral decision, From
the beginning the allegory is clear, the conclusion inevitable. The
dramatic power of the play lies in the focus on Biedermann, his
feeble attempts to assert some belief, some decision in the opposition
to the joyful do-evilers who come to live in his house. By means
of the comic and certain dramatic devices, Frisch alienates the au-
dience from any kind of affectionate release, forcing them to make
a considered decision as opposed to the indecision of Biedermann.
In the third act, Biedermann addresses the audience asking them
what they would have done. “And when? At what time?” There is
no answer.

It is one of the high moments of the school year when the Trouba-
dours present a play. Whether provocatively modern or the classic, their
work is always technically finished and a realization of the theatrical. May
we commend Dr, Jones and all the people connected with the production
for maintaining this standard in The Firebugs.

Biedermann Played too Loosely

On the surface this appears like an easy play in terms of character
portrayal and movement; it is, in actuality, very delicate and easily mis-
handled. The characters are sharply defined and the surface action is
simple, any deviation or poor pantomime can cause considerable loss of
audience belief. We felt, for example, that Biedermann is played too
loosely. We never see the solidity, however phony, a businessman in an
economically secure position. Tim Dols does a splendid job in the scene
with the fireman and the soliloquy, but the early scenes do not establish
any background or motive force which builds to the conclusion. He
too frenetic. Certainly the most truly solid character is Sepp Schmity,
played by Joe Volpe in his first Troubadour production, and I hope we
see more of him. With an overbearing physique and exceedingly cordial
manners, Schmity delicately storms his way into Bidermann’s house, thus
setting up the inevitable. Schmity’s fellow arsonist, Willie Eisenring,
played by Steve Colvin. Dropping all pretense, Eisenring tells Biedermann
that they will burn his house—a joke to Biedermann. Colvin does a fine
job as the oily, blunt ex-headwaiter

The supporting roles, particularly the female side, are ver) ably
handled, Babette, Biedermann’s wife as played by Yvonne Dickens,
is the naive helpmate who is always asking the wrong questions,
That Frisch’s concern is universal is displayed when Babette address-
es the female membership of the audience. Betsy Letcher shows in
her role as Anna, the maidservant, that she has gained the maturity

‘Romance’ Form

Similar To Novel

Medieval French Romances as
forerunners of modern novelistic
form were discussed by Urban Tig-
|ner Holmes at the fortieth Wé&L
seminar in Literature Tuesday night.
| Holmes’ lecture, which was given
}in duPont Auditorium, was spon-
| sored by the Department of Ro-
mance Languages and by the Sem-
inars in Literature Committee.

The “ingredients of the novel as
we understand it” are present in a
great deal of 12th and 13th century
French literautre,” said Holmes, but
| he warned that the modern definition
!of a novel cannot be applied too
closely to the medieval forms.

The chief difference between mod-
ern novels and the French Romances
is thet the earlier work was done
entirely in verse, Holmes explained.
In medieval literature, however,
verse was the only natural form,
since stories were meant to be re-
cited and verse lends itself to mem-
ory. Verse was used for the same
purposes for which prose is employ-
ed today. A second contrast between
the two forms is found in the ele-
ment of the supernatural present
in the Romances.

The speaker mentioned and dis-
| cussed several points of comparison
between the medieval and modern
forms. The Romances, said Holmes,
contain characterization and charac-
ter development. They show conti-
nuity of plot, with the plot most
often unfolding a love story. In de-
tails of local color, and finally in
length, the Romances are again sim-
ilar to modern novels.

The earliest Romances, said
Holmes, were either biographical, re-
lating the entire life of a hero; or

Opinion Poll
On Cut System

By SYD LEWIS

After eight months of study, the
faculty decided to approve a new cut
system to be instituted next semes-
ter. Although in a Ring-tum Phi poll
students (95 per cent) praised the
new system as better than the ex-
isting one, there were still some
doubts that the new rules concern-
ing class attendance were everything
to be desired.

 

Grades

Probably of most concern to the
faculty is whether academic work
will suffer because of excess cutting.
Twenty-nine per cent of the stu-
dents questioned felt in the short run
the grades would fall while 70.5
per cent thought the cut system
would not be harmful to grades and
5 per cent had no opinion. On the
other hand, only 5 per cent of the
students were willing to speculate
that there would be any long range
damages to grades.

Divisions

Certainly, the four possible divi-
sions which the new cut system im-
poses on students will increase the
bookkeeping headache for the regis-
trar’s office; however, 71 per cent of
the students felt the divisions were
fair and tht the extra beekkeeping
would be justified. One per cent said
they were not familiar enough with
the new cut system to judge the
arditrary divisions while 28 per cent
said they were definitely against the
divisions .

The fact that a student who makes
|4 “A’s” and a “D” is not considered
| Dean's list because he has made
|a grade below “C” was not changeci
jin the new cut system. As a matter

of faet, such a student who has over
}a two point will not even he

 

per-

| thought this was unfair.

distribute material to the Mock Con-
vention state chairmen and other
Convention workers, and will aid the
secretary in any other necessary
written work. During the two-day
Convention, members of the Secre-
tariat will be the clorks of the as-
sembly and will be charged with
seating the delegates.

Norton stated that members of the
Secretariat will be free to participate
in the activities of state delegations
if they so choose.

Convention chairman Phil Sharp
congratulated each of the fifteen
students on their appointment by
Norton and commented, “There’s a
lot of work ahead for this commit-
tee, and they will be on the inside
of any work done for the Conven-
tion. Their job will go on all year
and will not end until the Conven-
tion is over.”

Union, Room 12, in which the Sec-
retariat will work. The office is also
available for use by the state chair-
men,

Fitzgerald Assists Secretary

Norton appointed Ed Fitzgerald his
assistant secretary. Fitzgerald, a Phi
Kap sophomore, is from Laconia,
New Hampshire. He is a fraternity
officer and is one of the outstanding
members of the debate team.

The other students named to the
Secretariat are Rusty Ryland, SPE
junior from Urbana, Virginia; Rick
Kneipper, Lambda Chi junior from
Port Charlotte, Florida; Bill Cannon,
Phi Ep sophomore from Culpeper,
Virginia; Bill Washburn, SAE soph-
omore from Lexington; Dave Mar-

Martinsville, Virginia; Ned Bates,
SAE freshman from Selma, Alabama;
Jim Burton, Lambda Chi sophomore
from Erwin, North Carolina; Murrell
DeFrance, freshman from Akron,
Ohio; Dave Mayfield, freshman from
Durham, North Carolina; and Alan
Wade, Phi Kap freshman from Hunt-
ington, West Virginia.

State Chairmen Meet

At a meeting of the state chairmen
Wednesday night, members of the
Convention Steering Committee re-
ported on the progress of the Con-
vention. Sharp said that he “hopes
to announce” the identity of the key-
note speaker very soon. Negotiations
have been proceeding very satisfac-
torially, he said.

Sharp also said that the Mock
Convention has received letters from
“about fifty Representatives and
Senators since it sent copies of the
Convention brochure to all members
of Congress.”

 

Novice Debaters

At Wake Forest

By KEN McGRAW

Four W&L freshmen debating
over ‘the weekend in the Wake For-
est Novice Debate Tournament at
Winston-Salem won six debates and
lost six. The affirmative team com-
posed of Charles Levy, Alan Fow-
ler and Tyree Harris had a 4-2
record. Harris was chosen one of
the top ten speakers in the tourna-
ment out of a field of 128 debaters
representing 29 colleges and uni-
versities.

This weekend, W&L will send four
debaters to Morris Harvey in
Charleston, W. Va. Charles Reese
and John McMurray will debate for
affirmative, and William Grant and
James Stalnaker for the negative.

Students who wish to see practice
debates may do so on Tuesday after-
noons at 4:45, Wednesday nights at
9: 30, | or Thursday afternoons at 4: 30.

Not Proving Themselves

If there is one thing fraternities at W&L have learned
well, it’s the art of timing their trouble-making for when, pres-
tige-wise, they stand to lose the most. Last week proved no ex-
ception. Within forty-eight hours of the much publicized
IFC-faculty “good relations” banquet, all pandemonium broke
loose. Pleased with the apparent sincerity of fraternity leaders
at the Tuesday night assembly the faculty was almost immedi-
ately thereafter shocked by the reports that several pledge
classes were “‘encouraged” by their actives to “guard” their re-
spective houses over Halloween night. One or more fraterni-
ties sponsored for the freshmen rather lengthy scavenger hunts.
Pledges were having to engage in these activities during one of
the most critical hour-exam weeks. And as if to ascertain that
that the faculty would be aware of this nonsense, a pledge was
bound hand and foot and deposited near, of all places, the
residence of a W&L professor.

Such a fortuity of events simply brings to a head once again
a well-worn issue. Are the pledge programs of our fraternities
beyond re-examining and re-evaluating? Could it be that the
necessity of rallies, and paddle-waving reflect some shortcoming
in the instilling of the fraternity’s ideals? Is coercion merely a
resort the actives use because they don’t know any better means
of influencing a pledge’s outlook?

As long as fraternities continue to arouse these questions,
they are hurting themselves irrevocably. Is there any way the
fraternity system and what it stands for can reflect their con-
structive side to the University? In a case where their survival
itself is at stake, the fraternities can not afford to let this chal-
lenge go unheeded.

A Little Carelessness

It is our predilection, based on past record, that sometime
before the end of the year, a student of this University will
“total” his automobile. If the record holds true, at least one
person involved will die or suffer irreparable injury. The tragic
thing about this accident will be that it could have been avoided.
If there just hadn’t been that one little chance: that ‘‘one for
the road,” that attempt to pass on a solid line, the hasty trip
back home on an icy road.

If you are that student, you will never forget the details
of what happened. In a flash, you had found yourself in the
path of an oncoming car; it was too late for the brakes. What
followed was too sudden for comprehension—you only re-

call the nauseating sensation of a mouthful of blood, the|'
racking pain of a split skull. What you'll never forget is what’s |;

on the seat beside you—a limp body pinned to the dashboard,
a head obscured in the crushed windshield.

Inhuman, yes. It’s a gruesome price for just a little care-
lessness. But that’s one of the freaks of modern living—the
combination of an over-confident driver and statistical averages.
One of us in the coming months will experience such a freak.
Will this year find that it’s your turn?

Reader Questions Motives
For Inviting Ellison Here

\3

 

The Ring-tum Phi:

Quite recently the Trustees and
Administration of Sweet Briar Col-
lege have requested a court inter-
pretation of the will of its founder
to determine whether or not it may
accept for consideration the appli-
cation of a Negro applicant.

Randolph-Macon Woman's College
is trying, despite the efforts of its
many loyal alumnae, to get its Board
of Trustees to permit it to accept
a Negro applicant.

Is Washington and Lee trying to

get at least on the tail end of this
movement? Although both of the
above institutions are a bit extreme
when compared to that of Washing-
ton and Lee, one cannot help wond-
ering just what the reasoning is be-
hind the decision to invite Ralph
Ellison to speak in Lee Chapel, and
just who made the decision.
If we are simply in search of
interesting and educational persons
to speak here, why not invite a
qualified Chinese, Japanese, or Arab
to appear here? Surely there are
many others who could speak here
who would be timely and interest-
ing, and who would be available
and anxious to speak at Washington
and Lee.

Ralph Ellison can be no more
timely than Martin Luther King

the decision to have Ellison speak
principles, then it might be difficult

wondering whether or not HE is
coming for purely academic pur-
poses, no matter what the inten-
tions are of those who invited him
to appear here.

Make no mistake about the matter:
Ellison may not be one of the rabble-
rousers like Martin Luther King or
one of the legal-eagles like Thur-
good Marshall who are actively try-
ing to lead the Negro “crusade,” but
his purpose in life, or at least his
written subjects, is no more than a
subtle appeal for sympathy, money,
or anything else which will advance
the cause of the Negro, not help the

Chapters Resist Fraternities
On Racial Discrimination

(This article is the second in a
series of four articles on the gen-
eral condition of American fra-
ternities today.)

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Washington and Lee, in its se-
cluded geographical and social posi-
tion, is usually very much out of
contact with the general trends in
other American colleges. In particu-
lar, most students here are unaware
of the widespread problem of frater-
nities and discrimination, both racial
and religious.

At least half of today’s fraternity
crises is accountable to uncertainty
about discrimination on the local
and national levels. Traditionally,
fraternity membership has _ been
based on the foundation of White
Anglo-Saxon Protestiantism. Since
the middle 50’s, however, the princi-

 

ple movement in domestic American
life has been one of liberalization of
old our social and moral beliefs con-
cerning race and religion.

Stronghold of Tradition

Fraternities, founded in a differ-
ent age, have been the college
strongholds of the old order. Through
individual chapters’ feelings and tra-
ditional selective membership clauses
in national constitutions, the old
order has been preserved in frater-
nities. But within the last four or
five years, steps have been taken to
alter the discriminatory nature of the
fraternities.

These steps can generally be
placed into two types—the situation
where the schools involved act
against their chapters and the situa-
tion where the individual chapters

 

Tragedy Of Love Is Theme
In ‘West Side Story’ Cinema

The Jerome Robbins-Robert Wise
cinema adaptation of West Side Story
opens at the State next Wednesday
for a four day run;
it is the most dis-

Friday Columnist

Any considerations of social order
rest finally on the accepted concept
of man as an individual. Whether
the agreement is by legal provisions
or unwritten consent, the nature of
that philosophy is what will deter-
mine a foundation of action for the
regulating forces in 'the society. Once
this formative principle has been
established it must serve as the one
irrevocable belief of the society; it
will serve as the common reference
on which all judgments are to be
ultimately based. Any change of the
belief would concomitantly be a
change of the society.

The individual as a man has no
existence apart from a society. He
creates or realizes his being by as-
sociation with other individuals and
with his environment. Society may
thus be defined as the collective as-
sociation of all individuals, but both
society and the individual must be
defined in terms of each other. Ob-
viously, the individual is recognized
as a part of the whole, however, the
individual only achieves fullest de-
velopment in relation to his social
contact. Baron Wilhelm von Humbolt
in “The Sphere and Duties of Gov-
ernment” wrote that “the end of man
is the highest and most harmonious
development of his powers to a
complete and consistent whole.” This
whole can only be realized within
the framework of society. It is im-
possible to describe the individual
only in terms of himself.

It appears that modern conserva-
tive thought maintains that property
is the key to the individual’s de-
velopment. And since they see prop-
erty as the basis of achieving the
“consistent whole,” they naturally
regard the right of hclding proper-

 

which to construct a social order. It
follows that a government, under
such a conservative principle, would

operate solely for the preservation | ”

of this right and other allied rights
as the society became more complex.
From this arises such ideas as “that
government is best which governs
least” and government should only
“do for the individual what he can-
not do for himself,” for example,
breaking monopolies on property.

There is however, or perhaps for-
tunately, another view on the rela-
tion of the individual to society.
Liberalism incorporates the belief
that man as an individual realizes
his fullest potential and being
through his granted opportunity to
synthesize that which the society has
to offer and through hie contribu-
‘tion to society.

tributions to society.

This function of government is
to provide unlimited opportunity for
expression and development. Of
course, in a modern society, the im-
plications or ramifications of Liber-
alism enters into many areas of
human endeavor. For example, the
provision of a basic standard of
living by the society through the
government may be seen as a neces-
sity to fuller development based on
the idea that individuals
hampered by economic considera-
tions are also restricted in oppor-
tunity of expression and contribu-
tion. Whether the individual chooses
to utilize these opportunities is left

Behind the play is a writer personally involved as a human like

everybody else. The play is not a dissection or a satirical attack,

but a personal plea. Biedermann’s “tragic” flaw is that he will not
become involved.

The most interesting thing technically about the play is the chorus
of firemen. They are the guardians of the community who, unfortunately,
cannot be of service until they are called. They cannot combat evil until
after the conflagation has started, if then. We would like to commend all
the members of the chorus for the patience and perseverance that must
have gone into their difficult and individually underwarding effort. The
scene with Biedermann in the second act is one of the best to pass across
the Troubadour boards.

Technical Obstacles Well-Handled

Having a split-level set and a nine man chorus, The Firebug demands a
flexible stage. Because of the lack of this at the Troubadour theater, the
chorus could not be used with maximum effectiveness. Another technical
item that is annoying to the audience is the shadows that hide the actor’s
eyes. That Mac McKinnon still presents beautifully lighted shows is so

better facilities.

We have hinted that Frisch’s concern is not so much with Hitlerism or
conformism or some other abstract-ism but with human decision. Because
of this we wish the Troubadour production had not used German names.

Side, Leonard Bernstein wrote a mu-
sical score far above the usual stand-
ards for Broadway, and Stephen
Sondheim contributed enduring ly-
ics. Jerome Robbins devised bril-
liant and novel choreography to ex-
press in terms of modern dance the
emotional restlessness of the “Jets”
and their competitors, the Puerto
Rican “Sharks.” The original musi-
cal stunned audiences with its stark
power and agonizing tragedy; the
film is an improvement of the orig-
inal and, indeed, a trumatic ex-
tension of its virtues and the pos-
sibilities of modern cinema.

A word, first, about technique.
Cameraman for the production was
Daniel C. Fapp, (who is responsible
for the excelint photography of The
Great Escape and A New Kind of
Love); working closely with him was
Jerome Robbins, who restyled his
choreography for the heightened vis-
ual demands of the Panavision lens.
The result is a fusion of sequences
that is virtually perfect, so seam-
lessly do the scenes blend from ac-
tual West Side Street to studio
sets. All of the singing is dubbed
impeccably—Marni Nixon is a really
radiant Maria and Jim Bryant a
light but intense Tony. (Neither of
these fine singing artists receive the
credit on the advertisements.)

Their visual counterparts, Natalie
Wood and Richard Beymer, are hon-
est and sincere in their roles and
mouth their “songs” convincingly.

Stunning Dance Team

The remainder of the cast is su-
perb. George Chakiris (Bernardo)
and Rita Moreno (Anita) make a
stunning dance team; Russ Tamblyn,
Tucker Smith, and Tony Mordente
lead the Jets with genuine guts and
humor. You will not recognize many
faces among the gangs, but all par-
ticipants are quite professional in
the exuberance and sincerity they
bring to their roles.

The story is simple and moving:
an American boy (Tony) falls in
love with a Puerto Rican girl
(Maria) despite the fierce antago-
nism between their respective ethnic
groups—the Jets and the Sharks.
Tony’s best friend, Riff, is the cocky
leader of the Jets; Maria’s brother
Bernado is his opposite number for
the Sharks. Subsequent events are
touched with rich humor—and, in
the end, excruciating tragedy.

The Flaws

The flaws occur in rare snatches
of dialogue that should have been
left in the cutting room. Viewers
unused to morden dance may feel
that the ballet sequences look a little
out of place on the streets of New
York, but they should remember
that every gesture, every jump,
whirl, and crouch, is the expression
of emotion and depth of character,
as much as the lyrics of any of the
songs or the dialogue. The Rumble,
particularly, is terrifying in its cine-
ma format; but one must remember

revolt against their respective na-
tional governments.

In all aspects of fraternal life, uni-
versity administrations are seizing
more control in an abandonment f
their previous laissez-faire position.
Not content with regulating social
and pledging affairs, feeding and
housing for the fraternities, some
administrations have recently at-
tempted to legislate chapters’ senti-
ments on membership requirements.
Such “legislation” is usually in the
form of an ultimatum to the chapters
involved, setting a deadline for the
removal of bias clauses from the
chapter’s constitutions and by-laws.
Since 1961, for instance, Washington
State University, the University of
California, all the state colleges in
Oregon, Lafayette College, Pennsyl-
vania State University, and North-
western University have imposed
such requirements on their chapters.

Houses Go Local

In the latter case, that of North-
western, it was the university’s IFC
that initiated the anti-discriminatory
proposal. The Northwestern case
cannot actually be defined as an ad-
ministration’s attempt to legislate on
personal prejudices as the school ad-
mitted that “the right of any proper-
ly accredited association to choose
its own members is undeniable.”
Northwestern simply felt that chap-
ters should be free to decide for
themselves about their membership
requirements and not be encumbered
by national restrictions. This in-
stance is by no means characteristic
of many of the membership-legislat-
ing administrations, which often ex-
pect a fraternity to pledge a colored
person or Jew to show “good faith.”

Individually, chapters are taking
the initiative upon themselves for
anti-discriminatory action. In 1961,
the ATO chapter at Stanford Uni-
versity pledged four Jewish boys in
direct defiance of a national order,
and lost its charter after a legal
hassle with ATO headquarters. In
the same year, Kappa Sigma sus-
pended its Swarthmore chapter for
trying to convince other Kappa Sig
chapters to push for a non-discrimi-
natory amendment to the fraternity
constitution.

St. A’s Charter Plane

In October, 1961, the members of
Delta Psi (otherwise known as St.
Anthony Hall) at the University of
Virginia chartered a special plane
and sent five representatives to the
Yale chapter to try to stop the ini-
tiation of a Negro pledge. The Yale
brothers listended politely and then

went right ahead with the initiation.

Two months later, Beta Theta Pi
at Dartmouth servered relations with
its national to protest racial discri-
mination. In 1963, the same step was
taken by Pi Lambda Phi at Brown
and ATO at Bowdoin. Last summer
Sigma Chi lifted the charter of its
Colgate chapter as a result of the
latter’s defiance in initiating several
Jewish pledges.

Democracy Sullied

Naturally, the press has had its
say. The opinionated Christian Cen-
tury, (referring to fraternities) de-
clares that “these snobbish student
organizations profane the word ‘fra-
ternity,’ insult the ideals of academic
community and perpetuate discrim-
ination which sullies the ideals of
American democracy.”

Newsweek is most specific in its
charges. It blames the problem on
“steady-as-you-go Old Grads” and
points at ATO, Sigma Chi, Sigma
Nu, and KA as “the most important
national fraternities with restrictive
covenanis in their chapters.”

In conclusion, it should be pointed
out that the purpose of this article
has not been to recommend a course
of action or level any accusation.
The racial and religious situation is
an important problem facing our
fraternities, and no study of present-
day American fraternities can be
complete without an objective ex-
amination of this problem.

Generals Go To Tennessee; |
Meet Undefeated Sewanee |

Recovering from successive de-
feats at the hands of Susquehanna
and Hampden-Sydney, the Generals
bounced back with a 28-6 win over
Franklin and Marshall last Satur-
day.

Tomorrow they take on the unde-
feated Tigers of Coach Shirley Ma-
jors. Sewanee has given up only
two touchdowns in its bid for the
College Athletic Conference cham-
pionship. Austin College scored in
the opener and Centre managed to
score with less than a minute left
a few weeks ago.

 

The Generals have been hampered

greatly by injuries, many stemming
as far back as the Susquehanna
game three weeks ago. Fullback Dan
Manson will be out for the re-
mainder of the season with a dis-
located shoulder. He aggravated the
injury while filling in for Syd But-
ler in the Franklin and Marshall
game. Butler will probably start of-
fense, but will forgo his defensive
chores.

Halfback Harry Brookby will sit
out this week because of a_ back
injury sustained in the Susquehanna
game. At the other halfback spot, tri-
captain Stu Yoffe will see only de-

This past week the harriers in
their meet with American Univer-

learned that it might be a good idea

SALUTE: BILL WHEATLEY, JR.

To forecast an annual $12 million construction budget is
a difficult job even for an experienced engineer. But Bill
Wheatley, Jr. (B.A.E., 1961), met and mastered this very
challenge soon after he joined The Chesapeake and Potomac
Telephone Company of Maryland in 1961.

To help him with the details, Bill had a staff of eight—
four of them management people. After a year, Bill's super-
visors were so impressed with his work that they selected
him to attend a special business course at Northwestern.
This was followed by a promotion to Staff Accountant

In his new job, Bill conducts public opinion and market
surveys, then carefully analyzes the results for possible ap-
plication by his company. His engineering background
is particularly valuable on the scientific sampling tech-

niques he works with.

Bill Wheatley, Jr., like many young engineers, is im-
patient to make things happen for his company and him-
self. There are few places where such restlessness is more
welcomed or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone

Poll On New Cut System

(Continued from page 1)

might make an effort to improve
lectures in order to get more stu-
dents to class. For many years stu-
dents have complained that certain
lectures were boring and that a
liberalized cut system would place
a burden on teachers to improve
their lectures; however, only 36 per
cent of those students polled felt
that the new cut system would have
any effect at all on lectures.

Even with more interesting lec-
tures, there is some doubt whether
students will attend certain Satur-
day classes, particularly those oc-
curring during the big weekends.
Seventy-five per cent of the stu-
dents interviewed said they could
foresee certain days when there
would be virtually no one in class.
However, only 50 per cent of the
dean’s list students who have always
had the opportunity to cut more
freely felt that there would exces-
sive cuts on these weekends.

Finally, students were asked if
they thought certain teachers would
penalize students for cutting classes.
Many students stated that there
were already teachers who were af-
fected adversely by one taking one
week of cuts and no doubt the num-
ber would increase when three
weeks of cuts are allowed. An over-
whelming majority of 98.5 per cent
of those questioned thought that
there would be certain classes where

tures of a well-known character.
The origin of the word “Romance”
indicates that these tales developed
in the idom of the people rather
than in Latin. Etymologically ‘the
the words has reference to anything
written in vernacular.

Holmes was severe on those critics
who claim that the Romances are
not organic works, but merely the
ballads of wandering minstrels which
in later times were given “obessive
points of view” to make them over
as they are known today. He called
the Romances “conscious works of
art” and praised the genius of sev-
eral of their authors.

Holmes, one of the foremost au-
thorities on Old French Literature,
has written several important books
in this field. He was awarded the
honorary degree of Doctor of Let-
ters by Washington and Lee in 1948.
Holmes is Kenan Professor of Ro-
mance Philology at the University

 

of North Carolina, where he has
taught since 1925.

becomes increasingly more difficult
to delineate the actions of only priv-

The main point is that there can
be “no abridgement of rights” ‘to
establish religion, freedom of speech,
press, or association; which is clearly
reflected in our federal and state
constitutions. Liberal idealology is
summarized as a belief in a predeter-
mined legal agreement (a constitu-
tion) on the rights of expression and
government a proviso for that
opportunity.
