Chancellor Gaines Speaks
At ODK Lap Assembly

By HUBIE YOUNG

Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines, Chancellor of the Univer-
sity has been selected to speak at the 49th Annual ODK Tap
Day Assembly. Don Partington, president of Washington
and Lee’s ODK chapter, has announced that the assembly will |

be held on December 17 at 12 o’clock noon in Doremus Gym.- ||
nasium and will be followed by a*

banquet in Evans Hall for both old
and newly-tapped members.

Dr. Gaines, noted as one of the
South’s greatest orators, received his
A.B. degree from the University of
Richmond, his A.M. from the Uni-
versity of Chicago, his Ph.D. from
Columbia, and his Litt.D. from Duke
and Columbia. In 1930 he accepted
the presidency of Washington and
Lee and held that office until 1959.
Upon his retirement he was made
Chancellor of the University. In ad-
dition, he has received honorary
degrees from the following schools:
Baylor, Furman, Mercer, Richmond,
Wake Forest, William Jewell, Se-
wanee, University of Chattanooga,
University of North Carolina,
Waynesburg College, Hampden-Syd-
ney, Rollins, and Washington and
Lee.

An ODK member himself, Dr.
Gaines has served as president of
the Woodrow Wilson Birthplace
Foundation, director of the George
C. Marshall Foundation, and presi-
dent of the Cooperative Education
Association of Virginia. He is also
the author of three books, The
Southern Plantation, Lee—The Final
Achievement, and Southern Oratory.

Forty-Ninth Assembly

The assembly will be the forty-
ninth in which ODK taps new mem-
bers from the student body, the
faculty, and the alumni. New mem-
bers are selected by old members
on the basis of leadership and cit-
izenship in various aspects of uni-
versity life, and all student members
must be in the upper 35 per cent
of their class in scholastic standing.

Goals of ODK

Omicron Delta Kappa is an honor-
ary leadership fraternity founded at
Washington and Lee in 1914 for the
purpose of “bringing together cam-
pus leaders in a more relaxed at-
mosphere.” In the past forty-nine
years chapters or circles have been
established in more than ninety col-
leges and _ universities located
throughout the country. ODK today
is dedicated to recognizing superior
citizenship and leadership among
students, faculty members, and
alumni. Washington and Lee’s chap-
ter dedicates itself to fulfilling three

 

 

goals: 1) Recognizing men who have
attained efficiency in collegiate ac-
tivities; 2) Bringing together the
most representative men in_ all
phases of college life; 3) Collecting
members of the faculty and student
body on a basis of mutual interest
and understanding.

Due to this assembly, Dean Pusey
has announced that there will be
short classes on Tuesday, Decem-
ber 17. Classes will begin at 8:25
a.m., and will run for forty minutes,
ending at 11:45 am. The assembly
will begin at noon.

East-West Differences
Emphasized By Nagy

By JOHN SHARP

Mr. Ferenc Nagy, Hungarian po-
litical leader, spoke on “The States-
man in the Free World and in
Communism,” last night at VMI.

Mr. Nagy was co-founder and
President of the Independent Small-
holder’s Party and the Hungarian
Peasants’ Association; Hungarian
Minister of Reconstruction, President
of the Parliament in 1945, and Prime
Minister of Hungary in 1946 and
1947. When his government was
averthrown by the Communists, Mr.
Nagy went into exile. He has since
served as Chairman of the Assembly
of Captive Nations, has traveled ex-
tensively, and has written a book,
Struggle Behind the Iron Curtain.

Mr. Nagy pointed out the differ-
ence in the attitudes and actions
of democratic and communist states-
men. Showing great admiration for
the West, he remarked that he would
leave the similarities of the two
camps to be shown by someone
less well acquainted with Commun-
ism than he. Using parallel state-
ments, Mr. Nagy discussed contrasts
in methods of coming to power, the
role of the people in government,
forcign relations, personal character-
istics of statesmen, attitudes toward
the preservation of peace, and the
role of economics in Free World and
Communist states.

As one would expect, both the
U.S.S.R. and Red China were severe-
ly criticized in Mr. Nagy’s talk. Many
examples used to drive points home

were the forceful result of first-
hand observations. The duplicity of
Stalin was clearly shown by the

citing of Stalin’s personal guarantee

of Hungary’s independence, given
only one year before a Russian-
backed revolution overthrew the

Nagy government in 1947.

In a question and answer period,
Mr. Nagy continued to phrase his
opinions in strong terms. He said
that the Hungarian Revolution of
1956 neither expected nor needed
Western military aid. He expressed
little fear that Russia would out-
strip the West in production, in

 

spite of their emphasis on heavy
industry, and, due to his personal
experiences with the Soviets, placed
little faith in the durability of the
recent test-ban treaty.

In summary, the man himself was
of almost as much interest as his
talk, which was founded on per-
sonal experience and national hard-
ship.

 

NOTICE
The only placement interview un-
til Thursday, December 12, was to
be that of the representative of

the Stanford University Graduate
School.

Cancellation
The visit of Mr. Nathaniel C.

Allyn, Director of Admissions, Stan-
ford University Graduate School of
Business, scheduled for Wednesday,
December 11, has been cancelled.

* convention in which Washington and
Lee students will attempt to predict
the Republican presidential candi-
date in the 1964 election.

The announcement of Dr. Judd as
the 1964 speaker was made by Philip
D. Sharp, Jr., senior law student
from Richmond who is chairman of
the 1964 Republican Mock Conven-
tion.

Sharp said members of the conven-
tion’s student steering committee are
delighted at Dr. Judd’s acceptance
of their invitation.

“We are very fortunate to obtain
the same man the Republican Party
itself chose in 1960 to keynote its
national convention in Chicago,”
Sharp said. “Dr. Judd is one of
America’s foremost orators and I’m
confident his address to our conven-
tion will set the tone for one of our
most challenging of all mock con-
ventions.”

Was Medical Missionary

A former medical missionary to
China, where he survived attacks
from malaria and Communist ban-
dits, Dr. Judd was elected to Con-
gress from Minnesota’s Fifth District
in Minneapolis in 1942. He subse-
quently served ten terms in the
House before being defeated in 1962.

Dr. Judd is a nationally recog-
nized authority on United States
foreign policy. He served 16 years
as a member of the Committee on
Foreign Affairs, and he played im-
portant roles in establishing Amer-
ican relief, recovery, re-armament
and economic development programs
for the United States allies abroad.

When the Republican Party an-
nounced him as its choice for the
1960 convention keynote address,
Time magazine described him as
“one of the most remarkable men in
Congress.”

Twenty universities and colleges
have conferred on Dr. Judd honor-
ary degrees. In a Congressional
poll in 1962 he was voted by his
colleagues in the House one of its
five most influential members, the
only one so named from the mi-
nority party. He was selected by
his Republican colleagues as the
Congressman they “most admired.”
The New York Times has said of
him: “Among his greatest assets is
a reputation for absolute integri-
——

Since 1908, Washington and Lee
students have sought to name the
candidate for the party out of power,
and in seven of eleven previous
mock conventions they have success-
fully forecast the choice of the
national party balloting. Not since
they chose Arthur Vandenburg in-
stead of Thomas Dewey in 1948 have
W&L students been wrong.

Outstanding party spokesmen tra-
ditionally keynote the event. In 1960,
former President Harry S. Truman
addressed a Democratic mock con-
vention, and in 1956, Senator Alben
W. Barkley, Truman’s former vice-
president, was nearing the end of
his keynote oration when he col-
lapsed and died of a heart attack
before nearly 2,000 persons in Wash-
ington and Lee’s Doremus Gym-
nasium.

Washington and Lee students
pride themselves on the authenticity
of their mock conventions, and per-
sonal preferences do not influence
their balloting.

Student planners have been busy
since mid-summer setting up a po-
litical intelligence system which they
hope will reflect accurately the
strength of various GOP candidates
in the fifty states and overseas ter-
ritories.

Dear Sir:

A Good Choice For ’64 Keynoter

It is the boast of past Washington and Lee Mock Con-
ventions that they have been the most authentic, most realistic,
of all mock conventions. The presence of Dr. Walter Judd at
the 1964 Mock Convention will go a long way toward achiev-
ing the authenticity which has always made the W&L Conven-

large percentage of the letters to
the editor have concerned the “tra-
dition” of conventional dress.

There seems to be a large (or at
least articulate) number of students
here who feel that being forced to
wear coat and tie to class is an af-
front to their human dignity and an
attempt to squash their individuality.
Usually these people send in letters
urging the total abolishment of the
“tradition” so they can be individuals

tion stand out from the others. Dr. Judd is generally recog-
nized as one of the several gifted political orators of today,
and of course there is no better recommendation for a speaker
than for him to have delivered the keynote address at one of
his party’s conventions. To obtain as W&L keynoter the man
who served in this capacity at the last Republican Convention
is a fine beginning for Phil Sharp and the Steering Committee.

Judd’s great 1960 keynote address has been much publi-
cized, but a fact less known is that at the Chicago convention
he was also called upon to nominate Henry Cabot Lodge as
Republican candidate for vice president. At this second appear-
ance before the Convention, Dr. Judd was honored with a
lengthy standing ovation before he could even begin his speech.
Once again his address demonstrated rare ability, and when he
finished the Convention again erupted with tremendous ap-
plause and with floor demonstrations. Dr. Judd indeed ex-
hibited the skill of a master political speechmaker, one adept
not only at ripping into the opposition, but also at presenting
issues clearly.

The Minnesotan’s abilities go father than platform ora-
tory—he is also noted as a valuable legislater. During 20 years
of service in Congress he became a leading member of the
House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Dr. Judd was fittingly
introduced to the 1960 Convention as “a man—a leader—of
courage, of wisdom and of no thought of self.” The Ring-tum
Phi seconds the statement made by Phil Sharp: The delegates
to the Convention will have a chance to hear a truly great
American, and I am sure his address will set the tone for a most

adamant

successful Convention.”

Cockshutt Stresses Need For
More Interested Electorate

By ROD COCKSHUTT

“J need your help. I cannot do it
alone.”
President Lyndon Johnson ad-
dressing Joint session of Con-
gress, November 27, 1963

If you’re like us, your response to
this dramatic plea by our new Presi-
dent was two sided. On the one hand
there was a very real feeling of
eagerness to be of service to the
nation in a dark hour. But at the
same time there was a kind of crip-
pling uncertainty about just what
it is we are to do.

Far removed, as we seem to be,
from the powerful political mechan-
ism that keeps this country moving,
we are faced with a feeling of
frustrating impotence when it comes
to the matter of our personal influ-
ence on the course this nation fol-
lows in national and international
affairs. What can we as student-
citizens do to help in this era of
seemingly unending crisis? There are
several things.

First, those of us who are able
to can register to vote. A repre-
sentative government such as ours
depends on an informed and active
electorate which willingly exer-
cises its privilege of franchise. Stu-
dents from Kentucky and Georgia
can vote at the age of 18; the rest
of us at 21. A trip to the county or
parish Board of Elections over the
Christmas vacation would be one
way in which many of our eligible,
but still unregistered, students
could serve this country in a very
fundamental manner.

Of course, whether we are to vote
or not, we must be better informed
than we are. Perhaps if more of us
realized that next year this time
we could be carrying a rifle in the

 

jungles of South Viet Nam or at the
Berlin Wall, the day to day news

would take on a greater significance.
What happens today anywhere in
the world can affect us tomorrow,
and there is no escaping that fact.
It would seem we have a responsi-
bility to become more conversant
on the crucial domestic and foreign
issues we as a nation, and as indi-
viduals, must face.

Thirdly, we can become better ac-
quainted with our senators and con-
gressman—who they are and what
they stand for. We can and should
follow their voting records on major
issues and voice approval or disap-
proval as the situation warrants it.
Otherwise, we have little cause for
complaint.

Finally, more of us can think
seriously about serving the nation
in a more specifically vocational
sense. There are exciting and re-
warding opportunities for service
in governmental agencies, the for-
eign service, the Peace Corps and
a host of other areas. Nor should
we overlook the possibility of
elected office. If politics is “dirty,”
it is up to those members of the
citizenry with the appropriate per-
sonal and intellectual talents to do
something about it.

Indeed, there is much to be done,
and all of us who care about this
country are involved. To quote Pres-
ident Johnson once again: “ A great
leader is dead, a nation must move
on. Yesterday is not ours to recover,
but tomorrow is ours to win or to
lose.” That “ours” includes all of us.

all of the students, except for a

handful of malcontents (probably
socialists), love to wear coat and

nuded without them.

In the midst of all this controver-
sy, no one has bothered to consult
the student body as to its felings
about “tradition.” By the very defi-
nition of a tradition as a “belief,” it
must be voluntarily perpetuated by
those whom it directly concerns. Ac-
tually, no one can say with certain-
ty what the student body believes in
this matter of conventional dress.

And after all, whether to retain
conventional dress or not is a de-
cision to be made only by the stu-
dents...they are the ones whom
the “tradition” affects.

Our Reputation Unaffected

To say that the abolishment of
conventional dress would weaken the
students’ moral fibre or alienate our
benefactors is absurd. The main pur-
pose of this school is the spread-
ing of knowledge—not having the
students run around in coat and tie.
Moreover, whether we keep con-
ventional dress or not does not af-
fect our national reputation a bit;
W&L is known for its academic
excellence and not for the neatly
dressed students who attend.

If the student body is really in-
terested in finally coming to a deci-
sion on conventional dress, it could
easily do so by a simple vote—a
plebiscite. Such a plebiscite could be
readily set up by the Executive
Committee in the same fashion as
the yearly elections. A vote could
be held by ballot in the Student
Union on a set date as to whether
enforced conventional dress should
be continued or not. Such a plebis-
cite could even be made an annual
affair in order to register the chang-
ing popular sentiment.

If the people are interested, a de-
cision of this sort could be reached
and put into effect by the semester’s
end. All that is required to set a
plebiscite on conventional dress into
motion is an executive decision by
the EC, the only body on campus
with the necessary authority.

John Osborne’s new play, Luther

merits Kenneth Tynan’s praise of
it as “the most eloquent piece of
dramatic writing to have dignified
our theatre since Look Back in

Kenner cited Wordsworth’s “West-
minster Bridge,’ a description of
London in the early morning, and
Ruskin’s description of a fir tree as
examples. Though Wordsworth
succeeded only in making an inven-
tory of what he saw, it was a start.
Ruskin carried the tradition a bit
farther when he described the fir
tree as having outstretched arms
which hold flat tables of leaves
spread over like shields and spread-
ing out like hands.

This is the tradition which Miss
Moore has inherited and enriched,
a tradition of strict translation
from the purely visible to the
type-written page. She does this
not only by the abundant use of
comparisons, but also by the ar-
rangement of the lines on the page
itself, so that the shape of the
poem serves to convey some of her
intentions.

The poems are justified, according
to Kenner, not in the satisfaction
derived from them by the poet, but
only in the homage they pay to the
subject.

Several volumes of Miss Moore’s
poetry have been published during
the last 50 years. A revised edition
of her first volume received the
Dial Award in 1925. She has re-
ceived a succession of awards for her
poetry, in 1932, 1935, 1944, and 1951.
These were culminated in 1952 when

Varsity Club President, Bri
director Cy Twombly a check for
$600 during the halftime ceremonies.
Since only $512 was made from the
sale of tickets, the Varsity Club
furnished the balance.

There has been word that the
game is being investigated by the
N.C.A.A. as the unofficial score book
differs greatly from the official
seoreboard. The unofficial score
placed the all-stars on top 38-24.

Leading the all-stars, coached by
John Heinzerling, Gordon Gay and
Bob Barclay, was Steve Henry
(NFU) with 6 points. He was 2 for
3 from the foul line. Next for the
all-stars were Tom Burton (Beta),
Fred Schaeffer (DTD), Mike Mich-
aels (PiKA), and Fred Ridolphi
(SAE) with four points. Dave Britt
(Phi Psi) scored three while Randy
Poore (Kappa Sig), Bret Thackston
(KA), Buck Woodford (Lambda
Chi) Eric Sisler (Phi Delt) and
Charlie Sweet (Pi Phi) each scored
two. Scoring one point were Bill
Calmson (ZBT), Hal Holladay (SX)
and John Morgan (Phi Gam).

Coaches Norris Eastman and Joe
Lyles led the faculty scoring with,
5 points apiece, followed by James
Baird and Dr. Samuel Kozak with
three. Scoring two points were Dr.
Jay Cook, John Nichols, Herman
Taylor. Dr. Edward Atwood and Dr.
James Starling, each had one point.

Dr. Kozak and Nichols both had
perfect nights at the foul line. Dr.
Kozak was three for three; Nichols
two for two.

The all-stars utilized a four pla-
toon system, allowing all players an
equal chance to participate. Repre-
senting the other fraternities were
George Miller (PEP), Tabor Novak
(Phi Kap), Frank Wright (SN), Roy
Stallings (SPE), Mike Bowerman
(Law) and Larry George (DU).

The faculty, who also used a sim-
ilar substitution system, were over-
powering in the strength of their
bench, which included Coaches Dana
Swan, Lee MeLaughlin and Bob
Paine, Dean Lewis John, Baine Fox,
Frank Parsons, Dr. Charles Phillips
and Captain Alan Horwedel.

 

150 To Run Saturday

More than 150 runners are ex-
pected for Saturday’s fourth annual
Lexington-Buena Vista Road Race.

Washington and Lee’s cross-coun-
try team will run with eight others
in the college division race, which
begins at 2:30 pm. W&L and VMI
co-sponsor the event with the Buena
Vista Chamber of Commerce and
the Lexington Rotary Club.

The 10,000 meter (614 mile) course
parallels U.S. 60 from East Lexing-
ton to Buena Vista Court House.

VMI and Wake Forest will enter
both varsity and freshman teams,
VPI their varsity. Also entered are
High Point College and Appalachian
State, both of North Carolina. Fort
Bragg’s 82nd Airborne Division
will send a contingent headed by
favorite Joseph Czepiel, who has run
five miles in 24:18.

Wake Forest's John Carter, who
will not run this year, won the col-
lege division race last year.

Generals Open;
Wrestle UNC

Last night, preceding the faculty-
fraternity game, General fans saw a
preview of Washington and Lee’s
1963-64 wrestling team.

The team, termed by coach Dick
Miller “the best balanced squad I
have ever had,” opens its season
Saturday at home against North Car-
olina. The Tar Heels are the Gener-
als’ customary first opponent.

Coach Miller’s big problem has
been to pick his starters from the
available talent. Although he lost
three of last year’s regulars—Dave
Montgomery (130), Dick Albert
(167), and Jud Babcock (heavy-
weight)—who helped the team to an
8-2 record, Miller should have ample
replacements.

Freshman Dick Musick, in the 130
pound class, has not lost a match
since his freshman year in high

Henry Makes Team

Tim Henry of W&L was awarded
for the second straight year a berth
on the All-State soccer team
Wednesday at the Interscholastic
Soccer Association Banquet in Char-
lottesville.

Henry was the Generals’ only first
team selection, although five players
received honorable mention—Bruce
Jackson, Howard Busse, Wes Hor-
ner, and Chris Clark.

The V.LS.A. chose Paul Saylor of
Virginia as the most valuable over-
all player. Randolph-Macon’s Woody
Stokes was named the most valuable
offensive player, and Glenn Taylor
of Lynchburg the most valuable de-
fensive player.

Coach Joe Lyles said he felt the
judges leaned too heavily in their
decisions on the tournament play

 

I-M

Defending basketball champ SAE
won its first game, 67-26, defeating
Sigma Chi. Fred Ridolphi and Gene
Pearce each scored 16 for the vic-
tors. SAE’s next three opponents—
Law, Delt, and ZBT, who downed
Law, 28-19, in its opener. Stu Yoffe
and company kept Law outside with
a pressing defense, and led all the
way.

PiKA upset Kappa Sig, 28-27, but
a protest has been lodged. The
claim—ref Art Broaddus erred. Sig-
ma Nu downed Pi Phi, 27-23, de-
spite Bill Manley (16 points, 20 re-
bounds). Phi Delt, under “coach
Lou Paterno, opened up a 22-0 lead
on NFU, hung on to win 59-27.

The best: 1. SAE, 1-0; 2. Sigma
Nu, 1-0; 3. ZBT, 1-0.

In handball, Beta, champ last year,
beat PEP, 5-0. PiKA, second last
year, beat Sigma Nu, 4-1. In other
matches: Law forfeited to SAE; Phi
Gam edged Lambda Chi, 3-2; SPE
beat Phi Kappa Sig, 4-1; and Delt
downed Phi Psi, 5-0. The best: Beta,
1-0, 2. Delt, 1-0; 3. PiKA, 1-0.

A strong ZBT team downed a weak
KA team in bowling, with Arthur
Sher scoring a 200 game. In other
matches, Beta featured a well-bal-
anced team in defeating SPE, 2173-
2098; and Phi Phi beat PEP by 200
pins. Top game of the week—202,
by Pi Phi’s Steve Millard.

The best: 1. Kappa Sig, 2-0; 2.
Phi Psi, 2-0; 3. Phi Kappa Sig, 1-0.

Phi Gam looked like the best in
wrestling as they ran over SAE,
While KA was edging Delt, 18-12.
Sigma Nu forfeited to SPE. The

Generals Begin Basketball;
Meet Old Dominion There

Washington and Lee’s basketball quintet is in for what
could be a rough night in tomorrow’s clash with the Monarchs

of Old Dominion College.

The shooters of Coach Bob McHenry will be meeting a
team with more height and experience when they venture into

Norfolk. In this, the Generals’

first outing, they will have to

 

stop a high scoring team that almost*
upset Loyola of Baltimore last week
before dropping the contest, 79-75.

In two games this week, Old Do-
minion lost to Atlantic Christian,
96-89, and beat Pembroke State, 83-
65.

“We're going to have to really
scrap if we want to win this one,”
commented McHenry. “It’s hard to
say how good we are without play-
ing anyone, but the loss of a guy
like Bip Fauber must hurt you.”

In a full scrimmage Tuesday, the
varsity defeated the freshmen, 76-
48. The freshman team opened their
season this afternoon at Augusta
Military.

With four lettermen returning,
W&L’s strong point is their back-
court. There Lou Paterno and Don
Wallis, if he can shake a cold, will

 

start. Captain Tom Supak can move
in to fill Wallis’ spot if necessary.

The forward position shapes up as
a family squabble with ZBT’s Supak,
Steve Sweitzer, and Fred Mindel
fighting for the starting spots. Howie
Martin will open at center, but he
is being pushed by 6-5 Bob Spes-
sard.

Seven of W&L’s 12 varsity players
come from the sophomore and fresh-
man classes. Experience could defi-
nitely be a liability in early games.
but the main problem facing coach
McHenry will be the team’s lack of
height. With the exception of Martin
and Spessard, the Generals are with-
out a player over 6-2.

McHenry said, “We're going to
have to slow down and take the

Chaplin Reviews ‘Luther’

(Continued from page 2) |

on a privy and releasing, from the
top of the painting, the souls of the
damned.
Luther’s Devil

Osborne has taken up this image
of filth and excrement and given it|
to Luther’s own vision of the Devil,
thus amplifying the view that the
Protestant Reformation began on the
privy. For Luther’s physical seizure
is a result of constipation, and he is
known to have said that the words
“Justice of God” came to him to have
the meaning of “salvation by faith”
while he himself sat on the privy.
For this reason, Osborne’s attention
to this aspect of Luther’s conception
of the world is not exaggerated. If
anything, it helps to crystalize Luth-
er’s feeling that the world is owned
by the Devil, and that we live in
the land of sin and filth. In this act,
Luther is engaged in an interesting
dialogue with the Vicar General of
the Augustine Order, Father Stem-
patz. A few lines will serve to illus-
trate Luther’s feelings.

L: “Tell me, Father, have you

 

never felt humiliated to find that
you belong to a world that’s dy-
ing?”

S: “No, I don’t think I have.” |

L: “Surely, this must be the last
age of time we're living in. There |
can’t be any more left but the
black bottom of the bucket.”

S: “Do you mean the Last Judg-
ment?”

L: “No, I don’t mean that. The
Last Judgment isn’t to come. It’s
here and now.”

S: “Good. That’s a little better,
anyway.”

L: “I’m like a ripe stool in the
world’s straining anus, and at any
moment we're about to let each
other go.”

Luther is sickened by the stench
of the Devil which surrounds him.
It is this stench which directs his
agony in the working out his own
salvation; it is this stench that is
the agony of living.

While act three recedes in dra-
matic intensity and presents a para-
doxical, and inconclusive, portrait
of Luther’s position regarding the
peasants’ uprising, which came as a
result of what he had preached, and
from which he disassociated himself
to condemn the action, it gives a
fine picture of him before the Diet
of Worms, and ends _ successfully |
with him at home with his wife and
son, where he is hopeful of his son’s
future, and hopeful for the struggle
of humanity to gain and regain the

Miller terms 200 pound freshman
heavyweight Warren Stewart “the
best heavyweight at W&L in recent
years.” Sophomore Kem White and
freshmen Graeme Bannerman and
Don Patterson are vying for the
137 spot.

Four returning
Stover (147), Pete Winfield (157), Ed
Jansen (167) and Herb Smith (177)—
make the middle weights solid. Stov-
er and Winfield were both 9-1 last
year.

Freshmen Bruce Builder and
Chuck Bensinger are battling for the
123 pound class.

“You can always expect a tough
battle from UNC,” Miller warned.
“Our matches with them are always
wild.” The Generals, however, have
a 23-6-1 margin in their series with
the Tar Heels, and won last year,
19-8.

Miller’s charges have compiled an
impressive 29-10 record over the last
four years. They hold a 9-2-1 mark
over the Tar Heels during Mil-
ler’s coaching tenure.

Bob rose to his present status from a “long line” of
successful job assignments. He started his career as an
engineer in Cincinnati, where he was responsible for co-
ordinating the installation of new private-line telephone
services. His managerial capacity and intuitive business
sense moved him up to his current supervisory position.

Bob Crice, like many young engineers, is impatient to
make things happen for his company and himself. There
are few places where such restlessness is more welcomed
or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.
