Pace Elected
Party Leader

Tom Pace was elected chairman of |. 7

the Progressive Party last night, suc-
ceeding retiring chairman
Woodward. Woodward’s retirement
from the party of which he had
been chairman since its birth last
spring, had been expected for some

time. He had guided the Progressives |.
through their first election with un-| J

canny success, winning well over
two-thirds of the races for class and
student body offices.

After the clique meeting and
Pace’s election, Woodward stated: “I
resigned for non-political, personal
reasons.”

Pace, the new chairman, is also a
successful politician on campus. He
is a senior class officer and has
steered his fraternity, Kappa Sig, in-
to more class offices than any other
house on campus.

Pace had no comment on his elec-
tion other than to say that he is
“pleased to be elected.” The Pro-
gressive Party, he indicated, will
continue under the same organiza-
tion, makeup, and philosophy as it
has since its formation last spring.

A Kappa Sig senior, Pace is the
holder of a Hugh B. Sproul Scholar-
ship. He is a member of the Assimi-
lation Committee and is Film Editor
of the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi. Pace
is from Casper, Wyoming.

Members of the Progressive Party
are the following fraternities: Kap-
pa Sigma, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi
Epsilon, Zeta Beta Tau, Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Gamma Delia, and Phi
Kappa Psi.

 

Fail-outs Number 22;
Shows Decline In Rate

By HUBIE YOUNG

Dean W. W. Pusey announced to-
day that twenty-two students had
been removed from the University
after the first semester according to
the Automatic Rule. Dean Pusey,
however, stated that this number is
less than in the past two years, and
he stated a strong desire that such
a trend continue.

According to an official University
report, eleven freshmen, ten sopho-
mores, and one upperclassman were
forced to sever their connections
with Washington and Lee. In addi-
tion, Dean Pusey stated that an un-
published number of students had
been reinstated by the Committee on

Fitzgerald Flournoy Dies;
English Teacher Was 65

By LARRY MEEKS

Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy, 65, died
Wednesday, January 29 in Univer-
sity Hospital, Charlottesville. Dr.
Flournoy had been on the University
faculty for some thirty-eight years
including some two decades as co-
chairman of the English Department.

Dr. Flournoy, who joined the Uni-
versity faculty in 1926, was perhaps

Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy

known for his teaching and
reading of Shakespeare. Among
other courses he taught the two se-
mesters of Shakespeare, one being
histories and comedies and the other
being tragedies.

His familiarity with Shakespeare’s
works and his readings from Shake-
speare’s plays brought him into other
campus activities. Twice when
Fancy Dress Ball featured a Shake-

best

mond, Virginia, January 18,

 

 

spearian theme, Dr. Flournoy por-
trayed Shakespeare, reading lines
from the Bard’s plays to introduce
the members of the figure.

On one of these occasions, when
Life magazine was covering the Ball
it ran a picture of Dr. Flournoy
during one of his readings.

On another occasion, he read se-
lections from King Lear over Radio
W&L.

Dr. Flournoy was born in Rich-
1899,
the son of Mrs. Boyd Flournoy of
Lexington and the late William
Cabell Flournoy.

He received his B.A. degree from
W&L in 1921 and an M.A. a year
later. As an undergraduate here, he

'| was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, ODK,

Delta Sigma Rho, and was a member
of Phi Kappa Psi.

Dr. Flournoy was the second
Washington and Lee alumnus to win
a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford.
There he was awarded a B.A. degree
with honors in 1924 and in 1928, he
was awarded a Master’s degree.

He received his Ph.D. degree from
Yale in 1936.

He taught at Stanford University
during the 1925-26 academic year
and then returned to W&L and was
made full professor of English in
1937.

Dr. Flournoy was a past president
of Gamma Chapter of Virginia, Phi
Beta Kappa, a former member of
the Virginia Committee of Selection,
Rhodes Scholarships, and a member
of the Modern Language Association.

He had articles published in the
Review of English Studies and the
Virginia Magazine on History and
Biography. He was also a frequent
contributor of poetry to magazines
and journals.

Asia, part of his work was in diplo-
macy.

A native of North Carolina, Dr.
Behrman attended Davidson College
and UCLA. He received his Ph.D.
from Princeton University.

A specialist in international in-
vestment, international patent ar-
rangements and international licens-
in agreements, Dr. Behrman is cur-
rently the number three man in the
Department of Commerce behind
Secretary Hodges and the deputy
secretary.

Among his previous positions, the
economist was a professor of eco-
nomics at the University of Delaware
and an associate professor of eco-
nomics at W&L from 1952 to 1957.
| He is the co-author of Survey of
| United States International Finan-
| ces—1950 and Survey of United
States International Finances—1951
and the textbook International Eco-
nomics.

Dr. Talbot studied at Aligarh Mus-
lim University in India and the
School of Oriental and African
Studies at the University of London.

He has ten years of residence and
travel in Asia as a student, naval
officer, foreign correspondent and
writer.

The speakers will appear here un-
der the sponsorship of the School of
Commerce. Their lectures will be
open to students, faculty and towns-
people.

“The purpose of International Re-
lations Week is to bring to the cam-
pus distinguished scholars and men
in public life whose field is foreign
affairs,’ Dr. Milton Colvin, associate
professor of political science, said.

 

 

This program was begun by for-
mer W&L professor Harvey Wheeler.
The program is intended to awaken

Hollins Talk |
Is Attack On
W&L Weekend

Are we getting the most out of
our weekend social life, or is there
a need for change?

A W&L student posed this ques-
tion before the Hollins student body
in a talk given last Wednesday night
at the Hollins Chapel. In his ten-
minute speech, senior Ken Lane dis-
cussed problems of communication
created by the stereotype atmosphere
of the weekend combo parties.

Lane compared the relationship of
W&L and Hollins to the movie David
and Lisa, the story of a boy and a
girl who “could not communicate
with each other or to others except
on a very superficial level.” Lane
stated that W&L and Hollins suf-
fered a similar lack of communica-
tion.

One major problem, Lane ex-
plained, was that “combo parties are
so institutionalized that they have

The Mock Convention, now in its
ninth month of planning, is moving
faster and faster toward a success-
ful realization, according to reports
from members of the convention's
Steering Committee.

Announcements from the Mock
Convention this week include a
new brochure, a beauty queen, and
the possibility of an elephant for
the pre-convention parade,

Walter Judd, national keynoter for
the Republican Party in 1960, will
deliver the 1964 address in Lexing-
ton. According to convention publi-
city director Steve Smith, the for-
mer Congressman from Minnesota is
“now being pushed strongly as a
favorite son and also as Republican
Senatorial nominee from Minnesota.”
As Mr. Judd’s prestige rises in the
light of national affairs, so will the
importance of the convention here.

In keeping with Judd’s selection
as the keynoter will be the issu-
anee of a new convention brochure
which will have his picture on the
cover. The brochure will contain
much the same material as found
in the old brochure but will have

a few sections revised to “bring it
up-to-date.” The new pamphlet
will be off the press February 12
and may be picked up by State
Chairmen on February 13,

Bobby Mitchell, Chairman of the

 

Virginia Delegation, has announced

Debaters On TV

In Pennsylvania

Next week a W&L debate team
composed of Ed Fitzgerald and John
McMurray will debate at Dartmouth
College in one of the top tourna-
ments in the nation. In route to
Dartmouth they will stop over in
Philadelphia to debate the University
of Pennsylvania on TV.

The program will be telecast by
Philadelphia’s channel 12, and the
subject of the debate is “Resolved,
That the U.S. and Russia should
enter into a defensive alliance against
Red China.” This program, coming
from Philadelphia, will be seen in
all of Eastern Pennsylvania, Dela-
ware, New Jersey, and parts of New
York and Maryland.

This weekend a W&L team com-
posed of Ed Norton and Sam Fra-
zier is at Wilkes-Barre, Pennsyl-
vania for another tournament,

Last weekend a W&L debate team
of John McMurray and Claude Rod-
gers participated in the John Hop-
kins’ 14 Invitational Debate Tourna-
ment in Baltimore. Out of six de-
bates they won three and lost three.

McMurray, the only major de-

record in a tournament, was debat-
ing for the first time on the nega-
tive side this year. Rodgers, a
novice in his first major tourna-
ment was debating for the first
time on the affirmative side.

 

All of the 57 teams representing
52 American colleges debated three
rounds on the affirmative side and
three rounds on the negative side.

i To Conduct
Two-day Seminar

Religion and sociology will be related by Dr. Y. Ephram
Fischoff, a man currently working in both fields, in a two-day
Seminar in Religion on February 11 and 12.

Speaking at public lectures will be Dr. Fischoff of Lynch-
burg, Va., rabbi of Congregation Agudath Sholom and pro-

fessor of humanities and social science at Lynchburg College.
*

“Sociology and Religion” will be
the subject of his first lecture Tues-
day and Wednesday he will use as
his topic, “Religion and Contempor-
ary Social Order.”

Both lectures begin at 7:30 p.m.
in the university’s duPont Auditor-
ium.

Since 1961, three two-day Semi-
nars in Religion have been held dur-
ing the academic year at Washing-
ton and Lee, replacing a once-a-
year Religious Emphasis Week.

These seminars, planned to show
religion’s relevance to other academ-
ic subjects, are sponsored by the
University Christian Association in
cooperation with the academic de-
partment representing the particular
subject under discussion.

Dr. Fischoff’s appearance at Wash-
ington and Lee is being sponsored
by the University Christian Asso-
ciation and the Department of Re-
ligion.

In addition to his lectures, he will
speak in several religion classes and
be available for individual confer-
ences and meetings with small
groups of students.

Besides his religious and academ-
ic work, Dr. Fischoff takes an active
role in community affairs in Lynch-
burg. He has served as chairman of

his delegation in an honorary capaci-
ty. Miss Campbell, who bears strik-
ing resemblance to the former First
Lady, Jackie Kennedy, will sing the
National Anthem to inaugurate the
two day spectacular.

John Madison, Convention Parade
Chairman, said yesterday that he had
approached the Town Council of
Lexington to proclaim May as “Po-
litical Education Month in Lexing-
ton.” Aside from W&L’s convention,
the dedication of VMI’s George Mar-
shall Library will take place in Lex-
ington. Presidents Truman and Eis-
enhower will be in town for this
dedication; there is also a possibility
that Lyndon B. Johnson will leave
the White House to make the trip. In
any case Lexington promises to be
swamped with more prominent po-
litical figures than in any time in
its colonial history.

 

Madison also announced plans
to bring a live elephant to the
Shenandoah Valley to lead the
parade. Jim (Maharajah) Rowe,
according to closed door rumor,
could be atop the beast.

A Student Senate?!?

Many students have asked us if the Tuesday edition was
really serious about the idea of a student senate. Unfortunate-
ly, they seem to be and we have no answer to the frequently
asked question, why can’t they be far-sighted enough to see
that such an organization would be unwieldly. Perhaps they
are not practical-minded enough to see that legislation even of
the smallest significance would be seriously stymied by debate
and discussion. The only conceivable advantage we could ever
derive from this structure would be that we would once and for
all discover the frustration and waste that results from bureau-
cracy, when too many people try to get in the act.

The students we elect to represent us in the Executive Com-
mittee are extremely well-qualified and have shown every con-
cern for basing their legislative decisions on student body feel-
ing. What we suggest for the Tuesday edition or any other EC
critics is that rather than painting a rosy picture of some utop-
ian government for W&L, you might be more effective in your
sabotage if you could cite instances where the EC has passed
or failed to pass legislation in direct contradiction to the will or
sentiment of the students as a whole. We also would like to
plead on behalf of our EC that above all you base your criti-
cisms on valid grounds and avoid the false implications (which
to save you embarrassment we shall not cite unless you ask us
to) that you have presented in your editorializing thus far.

Our New Responsibility

With the institution of the new liberalized cut system, this

 

semester represents an experiment in freedom. The spirit be- |)

hind last spring’s student petition, which was the initiating
factor of the new system, was that now the W&L student is ma-

ture enough to assume more individual responsibility. Thus, in |
accepting this greater freedom, we have the duty of living ||

up to our side of the contract by not abusing the privileges that
the faculty in all good faith has given to us.

All students should get a copy of the new absence rules and
read them over very carefully. There are some fine points in
these changes which if you overlook, you can easily fall into
trouble. Also, these added cuts are to be used constructively;
a week’s vacation in Nassau would defeat the whole purpose
of the system. They have been given to us only to provide
greater leeway in our academic pursuits and we are expected
to use them accordingly.

Several years ago, an experiment in liberalized cuts was
conducted with the senior class and it flopped. Unless we accept
these concessions in the spirit with which they were petitioned,
we shall meet the same fate. Our new freedom, if utilized, can
promote greater development and richer fulfillment but if
abused, it is self-defeating and we will have to wait like Moses
and the wandering Israelites for “forty years in the wilderness”
to be given another chance.

The Reign Of The Combo Party

At an IFC-faculty discussion held last fall, among the sub-
jects that fraternity leaders and teachers analyzed was the mat-
ter of combo parties. Almost unanimously, the students ex-
pressed dissatisfaction at the way combo parties were being
overdone, that they were not providing a sufficiently gratifying
or constructive outlet. But when they focused on the possibility
of some alternative activities, discussions came to a halt. There
simply was no other means of entertainment that a fraternity
could join in on as a whole. So the IFC let the problem ride.

Last Wednesday, we had the rewarding experience of talk-
ing with a large number of Hollins girls who were likewise con-
cerned with this weekend problem of finding alternatives to
getting ploughed and nursing hangovers. They seemed to indi-
cate that combo parties and such are all right in their places,
but they should not dominate the whole weekend. What appar-
ently the Hollins girls regret most about our present social
life is that they never in the course of a weekend or Saturday
night get to know their dates.

Well, if neither W&L nor Hollins is really content with
our weekend set-up, who is going to take the initiative to change
it? Here the prospect is grim. Because who, after all, is going
to have the nerve to suggest something different and spontan-
eous? Who would be stupid enough to think that there could
ever be any other meeting ground between us and the girls
colleges than the combo party? Intercollegiate retreats? Panel
discussions? Living room Hootnanies? Seminar sessions?
Weekend softball games? No. How could we ever think of such
things?

‘Sundays And Cybele’ Praised;
Kruger Compared To Olivier

By BOB MOTTLEY |
Sundays and Cybele was an exqui-
site experience for those who could
appreciate it, although I suspect it
would have been
even more effec-
tive in the French
with English sub-
titles. The young
girl, Patricia Goz-
zi, was mature be-
yond her years,
while Hardy Kru-
ger bids fair to
becoming the
Olivier of France.
Cybele was a
definite improve-
ment over his last cinema role—
chasing rhinoceroses in Hatari with
John Wayne.

Laurels in New York are going
to Dr. Strangelove and Tom Jones.
Two films suffered disastrous prem-
ieres: Samuel Bronston’s The Fall
Of The Roman Empire (a dull thud)
and the hideously pornographic
Flaming Creatures that raised a
well-deserved stink in Belgium last
year.

Nine Hours to Rama is_ best
avoided unless one wants to see an
Indian version of The Untouch-
ables. The great Gandhi deserved
more than this from Hollywood.
(Hindus die as they live, calmly,
with imperturable grace, often in
tense misery. Only the last of these
qualifications applies to this

Mottley

 

wretched film. However, by going,

one may at least see unsurpas-
sed comedy sequences from those
long-gone days when humor did
not have to be vulgar and-or
sophisticated.

Judgment At Nuremberg, opening
Sunday at the Lyric, is a distin-
guished film in spite of several minor
flaws. It is better seen as an under-
scoring of Nazi cruelty and sadism
than a comprehensive indictment
of the German nation for its concep-
tual role in World War II. Most of
the film is anti-Nazi; one wishes
that the subcurrent of Germanopho-
bia had been left in the cutting room.
On the first track, the performances
of Spencer Tracy, Marlene Dietrich,
and Judy Garlard are beyond eavil.
A particularly brilliant contribution
is made by Montgomery Clift (of all
people) as a young Jew castrated by
the Nazis. Richard Widmark and
Burt Lancaster rub in the national
guilt approach with an exaggera-
tion that quickly becomes embarras-
sing melodrama. Somewhere be-
tween these extremes is the impas-
sioned defense of Maximillian
Schell—who suffers, albeit brilliant-
ly, from Osear-in-mouth disease or
verbal diarrhea. For me, the finest
sections of the film come when Diet-
rich tries to convince Tracy that not
all of German culture went into a
cesspool with the hegemony of Hit-
ler. Obviously meaning what she
says, Miss Dietrich succeeds admir-
ably. In short, one of the better
Stanley Kramer films.

 

Reinstatement Pressure Over;

Gradin g System Criticized

By DREW BAUR
The end of every semester always
is synonomous with the problem of
reinstatement and failing out. Who
to do what to, or
with is the chief

it gives masters
the leeway of ar-
bitration in grad-
ing, a straight let- |
ter grade, most
students would
agree, gives a mis- |
representation of

problem. Although |

 

 

their work.

Undoubtedly this
has been suggest-
ed before, but if anything is to be}
done about the Washington and Lee |
grading system, there should be)
carefully considered pros and cons|
heard from both students and fac-
ulty.

For a beginning, all final grades!
should be computed in a numerical
average. In some courses with cer-|
tain professors this would be easy;
in others, with professors accustom-
ed to the letter grade, it would pos-
sibly deprive them of the degree of
arbitration which they now enjoy.
However, if a student has a B- av-
erage, the professor would be able
to adjust his grade anywhere be-
tween 80 and 83. At any rate, there
is still some leeway remaining,

In this system any grade of 90 or
better would be considered superior
work. A total average of 85 or bet-
ter would be Honor Roll work, and
80 or better would be Dean’s List.
Work in the 70’s would be satisfac-
tory, with three weeks of cuts given
to men whose total average is better
than 75 and two weeks of cuts given
for averages between 70 and 75. Any

Baur

lower than 60 would mean condi-
tional reinstatement, pending a 75
or better average the following se-
mester. Any average under 60 would
be automatic removal from school.
All graduating students should have
a four year average of 70 or better.

Such a system would do away
with the unfair case of a student
receiving a B in one course and a
C in another for the same numerical
average in each. It would also do
away with the failing out of a man
who may have above a 70 average,
yet was removed because he had
three D’s and two C’s. Finally, it
would ease the job of the reinstate-
ment committee and decrease the

 

sometimes bitter attitudes of those
who were not reinstated.

Perhaps, the above suggested sys- |
tem is not the best one, but there
must be another alternative from)

Due at the Lyric in next two
weeks: Mondo Cane, Jules and Jim,
The Young Philadelphians, Lord of
the Flies, The Magnificent Seven,
This Sporting Life, and Phaedra.

Irate Reader Complains
About Lack of White Space

Dear Sir:

I have no quarrel with Negro en-
tertainers per se, but I do find it
utterly and extremely objectionable
to find pictures of same carried on
front page of your paper—for too
many issues this year! Personally it
makes me want to throw up!

Uncashed Check Prompts
Hot Check Committee Idea

Dear Sir:

“A Gentleman does not lie.” I was
told that a W&L student could cash
a check at any store in Lexington
by identifying himself as such a stu-
dent. However, I couldn’t cash a
check at the flick, the R. E. Lee
Hotel, a drug store, and a restau-
rent (although, at this restaurant
I had previously cashed a check),
Are the owners of these establish-
ments being ungentlemanly by not
living up to their duties, or have
W&L students established such a
reputation among the merchants that
they check themselves when ap-
proached by Washington and Lee
“gentlemen?”

Therefore, I propose that a hot
check committee be set up to assure
that this situation shall not continue
unchecked.

Yours in exile,

Edition of the Ring-tum Phi en-
courages all comments from readers
concerning this paper, the school,
and the school’s institutions. When
space permits all letters will be
published without alterations. Let-
ters should be addressed to the
Ring-tum Phi, Friday Edition.

 

In the last issue of the Ring-tum
Phi a courageous expose of the W&L
government was begun by Addison
Brockenrecord. Due to circumstan-
ces beyond his control, Mr. Broken-
record’s pen is now silent, a victim
of the absolute power the EC wields
over student publications. Truly the
good die young.

But the struggle for truth, justice,
and the American way will not end.
This week, I, Addison Brokenup, will
begin a new series to give the
public a blow-by-blow account of
this struggle against the tryanny of
the EC.

We will not be outliberaled, out-
libeled, outcrusaded, nor outshouted
by puppets of the Establishment
writing for other publications. We
will fight in the Commons, we will
fight in the Student Union, we will
fight in the Liquid, we will fight in
the Paramount, we will never sur-
render.

The EC met secretly to prepare a
forthcoming directive to W&L stu-
dents on the subject of continued
smoking: it is to be encouraged no
matter what the cost. This is a
calculated move on the part of the
EC, not only to gain in popularity,
but also to ensure the continuation
of a tradition without which the EC
could not hope to maintain its
strangle-hold on the campus—the
smoke-filled room.

 

Changes In Absence Rules
Go Into Effect This Year

Several changes have been made in
the absence regulations of the uni-
versity which will go into effect this
semester.

An upperclassman is permitted
three times as many cuts in each
course as there are class meetings
of the course per week if he has a
cumulative grade-point ratio of 1.5
with no grade below C, on his pre-
ceding semester report.

If an upperclass has a cumula-
tive grade-point ratio of .60 at
the end of his sophomore year, of
90 at the end of his junior year,
and if he earned a grade-point ratio
of 1.00 on his preceding semester
report, he is permitted twice as
many absences in each course as
there are class meetings per week.

A second-semester freshman is
permitted as many absences in each
course as there are class meetings of
the course per week if he has
achieved a grade-point ratio of .60
on the work of the preceding se-
mester. Only one cut in each course
is permitted if his grade-point ratio
is below .60.

Finalists in Two Sports Set;
Winter Sports Nearly Over

By TOM

Intramural action through

WHITE
Wednesday of this week has

just about decided the finalists in two of the four winter sports.

In basketball, it looks very much like SAE and Sigma Nu
will meet in the championship game. This should be the game
of the season, pitting offense against defense. Defending cham-
pion SAE has the leading intramural offense, averaging 50

points a game, Sigma Nu, the run-*
ner-up last year, the top defense.
The Sigma Nus have given up but
20.3 points per game.

Upset-minded

Looking for the upset in the bas-
ketball tournament will be Beta and
PiKA. Of the four contenders, Beta
(4-0) is the only one to have al-
ready clinched its division title,
though the others’ remaining game
apiece should not change their un-
beaten marks.

Beta won its league by virtue of
a 44-39 victory over SPE, who had
better luck in its other game this
week, whipping NFU, 64-43. Roy
Stallings led the winners with 16
points. SPE ended the season with a
2-2 record, while NFU was winless,
losing their fourth game to Lambda
Chi, 38-36. NFU had led 36-35 with
less than a minute left, but Lambda
Chi broke the stall and won. Richard
Drew netted 16 points for the win-
ners, who closed out the season at
3-1.

Should ZBT upset SAE, that
league would be thrown into a three-
way tie between ZBT, SAE, and
Delt, who upped its record to 3-1
with a 29-16 victory over Law, 1-3
for the season. ZBT collected a for-
feiture from Sigma Chi to set up the
possibility.

 

 

Boggs is Hero

DU retained a rather unlikely pos-
sibility of topping Sigma Nu in its
league by virtue of an overtime 42-
40 win against Pi Phi. The winners’
Charlie Boggs, who scored 20, sent
the game into overtime with a last
second half-court shot. Pi Phi’s Bill
Manley, with 22, outscored Boggs,
and later hit 14 in a 32-25 victory
over KA, DU remained, at 2-0, un-
defeated, while KA dropped to 0-3.
Pi Phi closed out the season at 2-2.

Kpapa Sig posted a 54-31 victory
over Phi Psi, George Madison pacing
them with 15. Dave Britt, scoring 14,
led the losers, who dropped to 1-2
with a later loss to Phi Kappa Sig,
40-20. Kappa Sig is 2-1; Phi Kappa
Sig closed the season at 2-2.

The best: 1. SAE, 3-0; 2. Sigma
Nu, 3-0; 3. PiKA, 3-0.

Handball

Beta, Delt, KA and PiKA all
clinched handball championships
and spots in the playoffs this week.

Beta reached the finals by defeat-
ing Sigma Chi 4-1. Beta closed at
4-0, Sigma Chi at 2-2. Sigma Chi had
earlier taken a forfeit win over DU,
who closed the season with a 1-3
record.

Phi Delt forfeited to Delt to give

Matmen to Meet N.C. State, Duke

The wrestlers met North Carolina
State this afternoon, and will wrestle
Duke tomorrow. Both teams are
studded with sophomores, and the
Generals will be seeking to repeat
last year’s victories.

In its last match, Washington and
Lee pinned all eight of Richmond
Professional Institute’s wrestlers,
winning 40-0. Coach Dick Miller said
the exam break had hurt the team,
and a week of practices was not
enough to bring it up to that pre-
exam edge.

He said, however, that this week-
end’s two opponents would be in
much the same situation. W&L beat
North Carolina State 19-9 last year,
and defeated the Durham school,
27-5.

Jamie Andrews will wrestle at
147, replacing Tom Stover, a victim

of the automatic rule. The regulars
will wrestle in each of the other
classes.

The junior varsity will wrestle
both opponents prior to the varsity
matches. The Generals thus far this
year have a 4-1-1 overall record.

Miller said of the upcoming sched-
ule, which includes Franklin and
Marshall, Old Dominion, and Vir-
ginia, “Some of our tougher oppon-
ents are coming up.”

RING-TUM PHI

    
 

 

By JOHNNY GRAHAM

Come rain or sleet or snow or dark
of night...

The motto of the Post Office De-
partment might just as well apply
to the Washington and Lee football
team’s annual spring practice ses-
sions.

“We're hoping for good weather,
but we never seem to get any,” said
General head coach Lee MeLaughlin
“In past years we've practiced out-
side in snow and the players haven’t
objected to it.”

The spring schedule calls for the
start of practice on February 12.
The session culminates with a full
scale game against the alumni on
February 29, Last season’s seniors
are eligible to play for the alumni,
and if a large enough team can not
be fielded by the old grads, the
varsity will lend them a few from
the regular squad.

About 55 prospects are expected to
show up for the practice, including
about 25 members of last season’s
freshmen team.

The Generals appear to have their
work cut out for them. Sixteen let-
termen were lost from last season’s
squad, including 11 first stringers.

Coach Mac has issued the call for
all players, regardless of whether
they played last year.

“Tm also asking that they be in
pretty good shape. We'll be doing
some scrimmaging every day,” he
said.

The schedule calls for three days

Spring Football Practice To Begin
Despite Traditional Bad Weather

of practice the first week, with
Saturday off. Practice runs Monday
through Thursday the following
week, with no sessions on the 21st
or the 22nd. The following week
there are sessions scheduled for
every day with the spring game
on Saturday. This gives a total of
13 practice days, well below the
maximum of 20 allowed by the
NCAA.

The purpose of having the spring
practice so early is to avoid interfer-
ence with the spring sport seasons.
Unlike bigger schools, a larger por-
tion of W&L’s football players also
participate in spring sports. Players

 

who are out for winter sports which
conflict with the practice schedule
are excused from practice until the
end of the winter sport season.

After suffering the loss of so many
lettermen, the Generals must find
help from underclassmen to fill the
places. Coach McLaughlin is look-
ing to rising juniors Joe Miller,
Tersh Baker, Starke Sydnor, Harry
Brookby and Larry Craig to join
with cocaptains Bill David and Tom
Crenshaw and rising senior Dan
Manson as the nucleus of next sea-
son's team.

W&L Basketballers
Meet R-M Saturday

In their first game since the semes-
ter break, the Generals were romped
by a strong King College team, 77-
59, Thursday night in Bristol, Ten-
essee, in a non-conference game.

Washington and Lee’s cagers face
their toughest test of the season Sat-
urday night when they entertain
Randolph-Macon’s Yellow Jackets at
Doremus Gymnasium.

The Yellow Jackets, Virginia’s
number one small college outfit, are
one of the two best teams on the
W&L schedule, according to Coach
Bob McHenry.

“We figured Catholic and Ran-
dolph-Macon would be our most
rugged games,” McHenry - said.
Catholic beat us, 79-70, and Ran-
dolph-Macon whipped Catholic by
six or seven points. We will have
a tough assignment Saturday.”

Coach Paul Webb’s veteran R-MC
club features a fast-break offense
and the accurate shooting of 6-6
Frank Kaminski and 6-1 Irv Sentz.

“Kaminski is good inside or out-
side,’ McHenry said. “Randolph-
Macon likes to work him in close
so he can get the easy shots. He’s
a top notch rebounder too. In fact,
he could play for almost any college
around.”

Sentz, a junior who “jumps like
a boy 6-5,” aids Kaminski in the re-
bounding department and is deadly
from long range.

schedule coming up, McHenry hopes
his charges can shake their pre-
exam weariness which was a “con-
tributing factor” in five straight loss-
es to RPI, Bridgewater, Western
Maryland, Old Dominion and King
College.

“In order to defeat Randolph-
Macon,” McHenry said, “we will
have to keep them from scoring more
than 60 or 70 points, stay on the
boards, and hit a good percentage of
our shots.”

The Generals have been hitting a
good percentage of their field goal
attempts, but in their four losses be-
fore exams their defense and re-
bounding faltered.

Guard Louie Paterno, who is aver-
aging 18.5 points per game, paces the
Generals’ attack. Guard Don Wallis
with a 10.0 mark and center Bob
Spessard with a 9.5 average back
up Paterno in scoring.

erals must face powerhouse Roanoke,

Space Age Industrial Problems Ciacunad At W&L

Kenneth Remington, who has
worked in the government’s Apollo
program to land a man on the moon,
spoke at W&L Tuesday night on the
topic, “Problems in a Technologically
Advanced Industry: Industry in the
Service of Government.”

Remington, director of Technical
Programing, Apollo Engineering
Space and Information Systems Di-
vision of North American Aviation,
Inc., discussed the problems which
industry must face in the era of ex-
panding government purchases.

Primarily, he said that industry
must meet the evolution of govern-
ment needs and that this is most
evident in the aerospace indusry of
which he is a part. To meet this
need, he emphasized that corpora-
tions must reinvest profits in re-
search to keep up with the chang-
ing times.

Using charts of his own company’s
profits, Remington stated that al-

though net profits were rising on the
whole, the per cent of profits was
falling in many industries which
rely entirely on government orders,
which, although large in quantity,
require that a company work on
minimum profits. Remington con-
tinued by noticing that rising costs
had only augmented this problem.
Finally, Remington concluded by
elaborating on the = specialization
which big corporations have in order
to procure government orders. The
actual act of bidding for the gov-
ernment orders has become so com-
plicated, that he said the actual pro-
curement of the order was as diffi-
cult as the production of the final
product.

a date for the weekend has become |
just a part of this institution, he|
added.

Combo parties are perpetuated for
two reasons, Lane commented. First,
we are trapped by the fraternity
image, where individual fraternities
compete for prestige by having wild-
er and more extravagant parties.
Secondly, “there is nothing else to
do.” Because of the lack of cultur-
al advantages in our locale, there is
little variety of activities that can
give the two colleges a common
meeting ground.

Lane concluded by stating that the
problem must be regarded by both
Hollins and W&L as mutual re-
sponsibility. He pointed out that the
solution will come through relating
to each other on a more personal
basis.

ARF!

Benjamin Franklin (or The Louisville Slugger, as he is better
known as) said, “A penny saved is a penny earned,” and we,
the college population of America, have taken to heart this sage
advice. We spend prudently; we budget diligently. Yet, despite
our wise precautions, we are always running short. Why? Be-
cause there is one item of expense that we consistently under-
estimate—the cost of travelling home for weekends.

Let us take the typical case of Basil Metabolism, a sophomore
at UCLA majoring in avocados. Basil, a resident of Bangor,
Maine, loved to go home each weekend to play with his faithful
dog, Spot. What joy, what wreathed smiles, when Basil and
Spot were re-united! Basil would leap into his dogeart, and
Spot, a genuine Alaskan husky, would pull Basil all over Bangor,
Maine—Basil calling cheery halloos to the townfolk, Spot
wagging his curly tail.

,

But the cost, alas, of travelling from UCLA to Bangor, Maine,
ran to $400 a week, and Basil’s father, alas, earned only a
meagre salary as a meter-reader for the Bangor water depart-
ment. So, alas, after six months Basil’s father told Basil he
could raise no more money; he had already sold everything he
owned, including the flashlight he used to read meters.

Basil returned to California to ponder his dilemma. One
solution occurred to him—to ship Spot to UCLA and keep him
in his room—but Basil had to abandon the notion because of
his roommate, G, Fred Sigafoos, who was, alas, allergic to dog
hair.

Then another idea came to Basil—a stroke of genius, you
might call it. He would buy a Mexican hairless chihuahua!
Thus he would have a dog to pull him around, and G. Fred’s
allergy would be undisturbed,

The results, alas, were not all Basil had hoped. The chihua-
hua, alas, was unable to pull Basil in the dogeart, no matter
how energetically he beat the animal.

Defeated again, Basil sat down with G. Fred, his roommate,
to smoke a Marlboro Cigarette and seek a new answer to the
problem. Together they smoked and thought and—Eureka!—
an answer quickly appeared, (I do not suggest, mark you, that
Marlboro Cigarettes are an aid to cerebration. All I say about
Marlboros is that they taste good and are made of fine tobaccos
and pure white filters and come in soft pack or Flip Top box.)

Well, sir, Basil and G. Fred got a great idea, Actually, the
idea was G, Fred’s, who happened to be majoring in genetics.
Why not, said G. Fred, cross-breed the chihuahua with a Great
Dane and thus produce an animal sturdy enough to pull a dog-
cart?

It was, alas, another plan doomed to failure. The cross-breed-
ing was done, but the result (this is very difficult to explain) was
@ raccoon.

But there is, I am pleased to report, a happy ending to this
heart-rending tale. It seems that Basil’s mother (this is also very
difficult to explain) is a glamorous blond aged 19 years. One
day she was spotted by a talent scout in Bangor, Maine, and
was signed to a fabulous movie contract, and the entire family
moved to California and bought Bel Air, and today one of the
most endearing sights to be seen on the entire Pacific Coast is
Spot pulling Basil down Sunset Boulevard —Basil cheering and
Spot wagging. Basil’s mother is also happy, making glamorous
movies all day long, and Basil’s father is likewise content, sit-
ting at home and reading the water meter.
