Miss Marjorie Norris

Mass M. Norris
To Head Group

Miss Majorie Norris, of St. Agnes
High School in Alexandria, Vir-
ginia, wa selected chairman of the
1965 SIPA Advisory Committee yes-
terday.

Miss Norris is the newspaper ad-
visor of the St. Agnes Shearings.
She was chosen at the adviser’s
luncheon held yesterday afternoon.

She succeeds Mrs. Nancy Brough-
ton, of Thomas Dale High School,
Chester, Virginia.

The chairman acts as co-ordinator
between ithe committee and the Lee
Memorial Journalism Foundation,
which sponsors the SIPA conven-
tion. The committee’s main func-
tion is to offer suggestions on im-
proving the convention.

 

Confusion High Here
Because of Leap Year

May is always a hectic month
for students in the journalism de-
partment at Washington and Lee.
The week before the annual SIPA
Convention is enough to put even
the toughest journalist on edge.

This year, May will be an even
busier month than usual. The stu-
dents in the department must give
a great deal of their time to cov-
ering the Mock Convention. For-
tunately, this comes only once every
four years and therefore no one
has to go through the ordeal twice.

As if this wasn’t enough to dis-
tract even the most ardent student’s
eyes from the books, just prior to
exams, there is an extra, added at-
traction this year. The George Mar-
shall Research Library is to be
dedicated May 23. President Lyndon
B. Johnson will do the honors with
the add of former Presidents Harry
S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisen-
hower. It will be a busy month,
and one in a lifetime for Lexing-
ton residents.

‘Him and Her’ a Rocket
Says Stymied Delegate

 

Two Rockbridge County, Virginia,
delegates from Natural Bridge and
Lexington have taken top honors in
the annual SIPA Currents Events
Quiz given yesterday afternoon.

Michael Zimmerman from Natur-
al Bridge High School won with a
top score of 68. Scoring a 66 was
Christine Capito of Lexington High.
There were 42 delegates taking the
test this year, ten more than last.
In 1963, the winning score was 89.

Answers this year varied as evi-
denced ‘by some of the incorrect con-
clusions.

Puppies Stymie Delegates

For Him and Her, the two Beagle
puppies of President Johnson, the |
delegates wrote a movie soon to be
released, a Broadway play just open-
ing, Profumo and scandel in Eng-
land, Richard Burton and Elizabth
Taylor, best selling book, by-words
of prejudice in Life magazine, name
for Russian spacecraft to carry man
and woman to the moon, and prince
and princess who ran off to get mar-
ried.

Barbara Streisand was called a
news reporter and commetator, a
new star with a large nose, and a
world swimming champion.

“The Deputy” was identified as
a recent TV program starring Henry
Fonda and Nikita Khruschev.

Johnson and Johnson

Ken Johnson, the Houston Colt
pitcher was noted as a distant rela-
tive of President Johnson.

Cathy May Baker, the 7-year-old
girl who wrote President Johnson
so that her grandmother could visit
her, was variously listed as the
daughter of Bobby Baker, a witness
in the Bobby Baker trial, a stripper,
an American swimming champ, a
witness in the Jack Ruby Trial, the
wife of Bobby Baker, a woman on
the Atomic Energy Commission, and
a nurse of the late President Ken-
nedy.

Huff Tough Too

Sam Huff, brutish linebacker of
the New York Giants recently
traded to the Washington Redskins,
was recognized as a golfer compet-
ing internationally, winner of the
International Open, a senator run-
ning for President of the United
States, a ballet dancer, a crooner,
star of the Metropolitan Opera, and
United States chess champion.

The movie “842” was termed the
high jump record and a nuclear cut-
back plan.

Robert Moses of the New York
World’s Fair was made known as a

 

composer of symphonies.

Meetings Keep SIPA Delegates Busy

Round-tables and short courses
were again the heart of the SIPA
Convention this year. Delegates to
the convention could choose from
24 round-tables and 16 short courses.

There were round-tables for the
staffs of newspapers, magazines, and
yearbooks. In addition to these cate-
gories, photography was added to
the list of subjects tackled in the
short courses.

The round-tables and short courses

 

were held all day Friday and Sat-
urday morning. There were 12 news-
paper round-tables, four magazine
round-tables, and five yearbook
round-tables,

Four short courses were offered in
both the newspaper and magazine
fields. There were three photograph-
ic short courses and five yearbook
short courses.

The round-tables were run by the
delegates themselves, with a few

 

Interview Format Praised

By Trussell In Chapel Talk

At a talk in Lee Chapel Saturday,
Tait Trussell told SIPA delegates
about the pros and cons of the
question and answer format in news
reporting. Trussell a Washington
and Lee graduate, is currently the
associate editor of Nation’s Business,
a magazine published by the Cham-
ber of Commerce of the United
States. He addressed the students
and their advisers shortly after 11
a.m.

Mr. Trussell said that a story pre-
sented in a question and answer
format can be as dramatic as a
murder trial and as authoratative as
an official text. He called the dele-
gates attention to the fact that more

 

and more newspapers and magazines
are rediscovering the question and
answer format. Many newspapers
and magazines make it a point to
regularly publish interviews in this
fashion. He went on to say that this
is their way of competing with the
host of interviews on television.

He explained how he had request-
ed and was waiting for a time to
interview then-Vice President Lyn-
don Johnson when the news came
of the assasination of President Ken-
nedy.

exceptions. The advisers to the var-
ious delegations presided and kept
things moving.

The short courses were run by
“experts“ in teaching and private
business. Mr. Howard Hammersley
manager of the photographic de-
partment of the Roanoke (Va.)
Times and World News met with
three different sessions.

Mr. James Boatwright, editor of
Washington and Lee’s literary mag-
azine, Shenandoah, and instructor in
English at the University, gave
three short courses in magazines.

The yearbook short courses were
given by Mrs. Pearl Hanson, for-
merly of Washington-Lee High
School; Dr. Regis L. Boyle, Wood-
row Wilson High School and Catho-
lic University of America; and Fred-
erick F. Hafner, with the University
Press Division of William J. Keller,
Ine., publishers.

The newspaper short courses were
given by four members of the pro-
fesisonal press. William G. Lev-
erty, assistant managing editor of
the Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch,
gave a course in newspaper design.
Other professionals participating
were William Fishback, Richmond
(Va.) Times-Dispatch; Horace Hood,
assistant editor Roanoke (Va.) Times
and World News; and Edward Back-

Childs Cautions Press

By TIM O'KEEFE |
The American press must meet the
revolutionary change that is being}
undergone in every department of |
life, Marquis Childs, syndicated |
Washington columnist, told SIPA}
students yesterday.
Childs said that all communica-|
tions media must become more ob-|
jective in their coverage if they are
to carry out their share of respon-|
silibity in this time of challenge.
Acting as a combination Cassan-
dra and complainant in his talk
Childs first posed these two ques-|
tions to his audience. Do the news|
media give sufficient evaluation to
the news they print? And just be-
cause some has made a statement,
does that necessarily make it news?
He gave two examples of where
the press had failed in both respects.
“It was just 10 years ago today
that the Senate was wrestling with
the problem of Sen. Joseph Mc-
Carthy and the way he had flouted
the rules of the Senate and made
a shambles of Senate dignity with |
his infamous ‘hearings’.” Childs said. |
“That all started with a casual|
radio talk by McCarthy in which he|
declared that there were 69 card-
carrying communist in the State
Department. Most news media gave
that sensational play without eval-|

 

 

“After a long conflict it was estab- |
lished that McCarthy did not have)
the name of a single card-carrying |
communist in the State Department. |
But by that time he had discredited |
three or four individuals by in-|
nuendo,” he said.

“The question I would like to leave |
with you today is whether the
fearful damage done by McCarthy |
might not have been avoided by |

| another approach. It seems to me!

that we had an obligation to eval-|
uate and to include that evaluation |
as part of the news report. That
false statement made by that single
irresponsible individual did incal- |
cuable harm,” Childs said.

In 1960 the Democrats put a lot}
o fstress in their emagiapfnro T E}
of stress in their campaign for the
presidency on the “missile gap.” |
The missile gap was a myth. It
originated largely out of propaganda |
of the Air Force Intelligence, which
had greatly over-estimated the |
Soviet missile capacity, childs said.

The press made headlines out of
the story but it was almost entirely |
without foundation. This also points |
out one of the unhappy aspects |
of political life today, he said.

“Big defense contracts have be-|
come entangled with partisan poli-
tics. You will hear the ‘ins’ asking |

“This kind of political pressure is | type of

expenditure. In my opinion the press| can convention July

has an obligation to challenge this

campaigning,” Childs said.

Francisco, Childs said that Sen. Bar- |
ry Goldwater could come close to}

ballot.

Still, there is room for doubt that |
Goldwater will win the nomination. |
He has not stacked up too well in|
publie opinion polls as the man who

would run best against President
Johnston.

“If Goldwater fails in his bid, he|
will have so much strength that

he probably will be able to select
the candidate himself. I believe that
he will throw his support to Rich-
ard Nixon, who would serve as
the party’s best compromise candi-
date,” Childs said.

Childs sad he personally thought
Lodge or Scranton would make the}
most effective candidates against |
President Johnson next November. |
But the chance that either will get |
the nomination is small, he said.

Marquis Childs has been a news-
paper man for 40 years. During this
time he has established a reputation
as a specialist in the reporting of |
international and national news.

Childs was born in the Mississip-
pi River town of Clinton, Iowa. He
decided at the age of 13 that he
wanted to be a newspaperman. He
does not remember what prompted |
that decision. His father was a law-|
yer and his forebearers had been
farmers.

landed a job with the United Press
in Chicago. He resigned a year later
to take his M.A. degree at the Uni-
versity of Iowa. In 1925, Childs re-
turned to the United Press, this time
in New York.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch

| lured Childs west in 1926. He took

a job with the paper as a feature
writer. He was soon covering stories
all over the country. He was sent to
Europe in 1930 and spent several
months there studying and reporting

| the economic and social effects of the

changing governmental policies in
Scandinavia, Germany and the mid-
dle European countries. In 1936 he
was named Washington correspon-

| dent for the Post-Dispatch.

Shortly before World War II he
visited Mexico and _ studied that
country’s oil expropriation program.

| Several of his reports were “so hot”

that an investigation of several
prominent U.S. Senators was order-
ed. Childs was roundly denounced
from the Senate floor by the af-
fected senators, but he sued and
won a full apology from all con-

| concerned. The Senators had charged

him with biased reporting in speech-
es on the Senate floor.

During the war Childs saw much
of the world. He covered events

| in England, Brazil, Sweden, and Bo-

ivia. His now famous Washington

Sagendorf Tells Delegates
About Life with “Popeye”

Forrest “Bud” Sagendorf, noted |
cartoonist and drawer of the “Pop-
eye” magazine and comic strip for
King Features Syndicate, appeared
before the 35th annual SIPA Con-
vention Friday in Doremus Gymna-
sium. He spoke at a General Ses-
sion of the convention at 12:05 p.m.
He followed Marquis Childs, noted
columnist, who addressed the con-
vention at a General Session shortly
after 11 a.m.

This year’s visit marked the second
time that Sagendorf has appeared
before the group. His last visit
was to the 3lst annual convention in
1960.

Expert on Popeye

The subject of Sagendorf’s talk
was “Life with Popeye.” There is
no one person living who is as qual-
ified as Sagendorf to talk on this
subject.

While still in high school, Sagen-
dorf, who is a native of the state of
Washington, went to work for the
late E. C. Segar, the creator of
“Popeye.” He could not have found
a better teacher. Segar was the
master of the humorous continuity
strip.

Sagendorf says he took up draw-
ing at an early age because it was
easier to draw than to spell. He has
since mastered the art of spelling,
with a few possible exceptions he
admits.

While working under  Segar,
Sagendorf had the fun of “going
through the labor pains of the birth
of many wonderful characters such
as Swee’pea, Eugene the Jeep, Alice
the Goon and Poopydeck-Pappy.

Takes Over Strip

After Segar’s death in 1963, Sagen-
dorf was called east by King Fea-
tures to continue Segar’s work on
the strip. It was not long before he
was lured to a desk job, assistant
comic art director in charge of pro-
duction.

 

He did the job well, but when
King Features decided to publish
a “Popeye” comic magazine, he once
again climbed behind the drawing
board. He undertook to draw and
write the entire magazine.

In 1959, Sagendorf again took over
the daily and Sunday comic strip.
This load was in addition to the
magazine.

Starts Cartoon Course

In 1950, Sagendorf joined the
faculty of the Famous Artists
School in Westport, Conn., where he
now makes his home. Five years, and
hundreds of cartoons later, he started
the course in cartooning now offer-
ed by the school. His course is now
being followed by hundreds of to-
morrow’s cartoonists.

Sagendorf is married and _ has
three children. Among his hobbies is
the creation of toys and games, most
of which are connected with his
cartoon characters. He has taken up
bowling in the past few years and
builds quarter sized gasoline racers.

“Tf I hadn’t been born a coward,”
he comments philosophically, “I
would like to own and drive a real
racing car.”

 

Seven States

Represented

The 35th annual SIPA Convention
was attended by 1,023 students and
their advisers.

The delegates represented 183
public and private schools from
North Carolina, South Carolina, Vir-
ginia, Maryland, Tennessee, West
Virginia, Georgia, and Washington,
Da.

The ratio of girls to boys at the
convention was high. This year it
was about two to one, fractions being
impossible.

Prof, Paxton Davis

Davis Directs
Short Courses

Paxton Davis, professor of journal-
ism here, is serving as director of
SIPA short courses again this year.

A member of the faculty since
1953, Davis has authored two books
and published a number of short
stories, poems and articles. His lat-
est story was published in the No-
vember, 1962 issue of Playboy.

Before coming to W&L, Davis
worked on the Richmond Times-
Dispatch and the Winston-Salem
Journal and Sentinel. He is presently
book editor of the Roanoke Times
and has served as editorial writer
and business editor on the Winston-
Salem newspapers during the sum-
mer,

Follows Routine

Davis says he writes best when
following a daily routine. He is now
working on his third book. The first,
Two Soldiers (1956), includes two
short World War II novels. The Bat-
tle of New Market (1963) is a non-
fiction work dealing with the Civil
War battle.

Davis served as director of SIPA
in 1958, while O. W. Riegel, director
of the Lee Memorial Journalism
Foundation was on leave of absence
in Paris.

Two years earlier, he had become
a Fellow in Fiction of the Bread
Loaf Writers Conference, a Vermont
literary organization which stimu-
lates the exchange of ideas between
novelists and prospective writers.

Wins VPA Award

In 1951, while working for the
Times-Dispatch, Davis received the
first place award in series writing
from the Virginia Press Association. |

A native of Winston-Salem, Davis
attended Virginia Military Institute
in 1942-43, before entering the army |
in World War II.

He graduated from Johns Hopkins
in 1949 with an A.B. degree in Eng-
lish. There he served as editor of
the yearbook for two years, and as|
columnist for the newspaper.

Davis is married and has three|
children,

 

ly newscast from the W&L radio
newsroom, is a unique combination
of classroom, laboratory and extra-
curricular activity. International,
national, sports, state and local news
are covered in the student broadcast.

Since Home Edition is on the air
five nights a week, it is the primary
source of local news for area citizens.
Often it beats the weekly county
newspaper and school paper by sev-
eral days in breaking a story.

The W&L produced newscast is
the last news show of the evening
aired by radio station WREL.

Students Report Local News

Local news is covered by mem-
bers of W&L’s journalism depart-
ment, with each student covering a
“beat” for two semesters while at-
tending the university. Other Home
Edition news arrives via Associated
Press teletype.

Regular beats covered by the stu-
dent reporters in the county include
the town and county offices, police
stations, club and charity organiza-
tions, VMI and W&L and the sports
activity in the area.

All stories are rewritten by mem-
bers of each of the five nightly staffs
in order to produce a program of
sound format and consistent style. A
typical night in the Home Edition
newsroom often includes scurrying
around to cover a_ late-breaking
story, tape recording Radio Moscow
for “the other side of the story,” or
taping the remarks of the many
prominent speakers who visit W&L.

Bruce Whelihan, a senior from
Philadelphia, Pa. is Home Edi-
tion news director this semester.
Senior editors who direct each of
the five nightly shows are Guy
Unangst, Steve Owen, Rick Krall,
Peter Blakeslee and Whelihan.

Editorials Broadcast

In addition to its regular news-
gathering tasks, Home Edition usu-
ally broadcasts an editorial each
Friday night and special editorials
when the need arises. (The Ken-
nedy assasination.)

Posters
Confuse
Visitors

Delegates to the 35th annual
Southern Interscholastic Press As-
sociation Convention had a hard

time finding out who was running
for the presidency of SIPA for the
coming year.

The confusion was the result of
the signs throughout the town sup-
porting Scranton, Lodge, Nixon,
Rockefeller and Goldwater for the
presidency. Was there really a mister
and miss named Scranton running
for SIPA president?

No, there was not. The posters are
all part of the color and the chaos
that comes when it is Mock Conven-
tion time at Washington and Lee.

Each presidential election year the
student body of the University holds
a political mock convention, run just
like the real conventions scheduled
during the summer.
for later in the summer.

A Republican Year

This year the job is to nominate
a Republican to run for the office
of President of the United States.
The convention always features the
party that is out of office.

In 1960, when the last Mock Con-
vention was held, the students nom-
inated a Democrat, Sen. John F.
Kennedy, to head his party’s ticket
in the national election. Sen. Ken-
nedy did win his party’s nomination
later the same summer, and went on
to defeat Richard Nixon in the na-
tional election.

The Mock Convention has been
held at Washington and Lee every
election year since 1908 with two
exceptions. There was no Mock Con-
vention in 1920 and in 1944 because
the country was at war.

Seven and Four Record

There have been seven correct
nominations. This means that Uni-
versity students nominated the same
person that the featured party nom-
inated in its official convention.

This year the Mock Convention
is being held Monday and Tuesday,
May 4 and 5. The convention will
begin with a parade Monday after-
noon. After the parade all the del-
egates will meet in the Doremus
Gymnasium, where the SIPA lunch-
eon was held this afternoon, and the
official convention will begin.

Judd Will Keynote

The feature attraction will be the
keynote address, which will be given
Monday night by the Honorable
Walter Judd, a former Congress-
man from Minnesota and the key-
note speaker at the Republican Con-
vention in 1960. The balloting for the
nomination will begin Tuesday
morning after the nominating
speeches and after the state chair-
men have had a chance to get in
touch with party leaders in the states
that they represent.

 

 

Judges Kept Busy

The 316 publications and the
four radio programs competing
for SIPA trophies this year came
from 183 public and _ private
schools.

There were 143 newspapers en-
tered for judging, 134 yearbooks,
and 39 magazines.

News and World Report, uses the
interview as a means of getting
something similar to a signed article
by an expert.

Trussell told delegates of some of
his experiences interviewing such
people as the late Senator Robert 5S.
Kerr, who was known as “King of
the Senate.” He gave the delegates
some tips on preparing for an in-
terview and told them how to se-
lect the best subject for an inter-
view.

Studied Journalism

A Navy veteran, Trussell gradu-
ated from Washington and Lee as
a journalism major in 1949. He has
made Washington, D.C., his beat.
After graduation he was a Washing-
ton correspondent for the St. Peters-
burg, (Fla.), Times. He once served
on the editorial staff of Congression-
al Quarterly News Features. Before
joining the staff of Nation’s Busi-
ness, he was a member of the Wash-
ington bureau of the Wall Street
Journal and a reporter for the Wash-
ington Star.
Trussell is a member of Sigma
Delta Chi, a journalistic society,
and the recipient of the 1961 Loeb
Special Achievement Magazine
Award for distinguished business
and financial writing. He is the au-
thor of “Income Taxes 1862-1962,”
a light history of the Internal Rev-
enue Service; and he created and
produced a documentary record
album entitled “Best of Washington
Humor.” The Trussells and their
two sons live in Washington. He is
a third | generation journalist.

Lee Offered

First Course
In Journalism

“Aibusrd,” said E. L. Godkin of
the New York Evening Post, when
he heard that Gen. Robert E. Lee
was planning to add a course in
journalism to the curriculum of
Washington College (now Washing-
ton and Lee University).

This was in the post-Civil War
era, when journalism instruction was
still an untested idea. It was in
1869, when Lee was president of
Washington College, that the first
Press Scholarships were established.

The scholarships, 50 in all, went
to “young men proposing to make
printing and journalism their life
work and profession.”

Courses Suspended

But General Lee died in 1870,
the Reconstruction brought hard
times, and instruction in journalism
was suspended in 1878. The revival
of the courses was not again con-
sidered until 1921.

In that year, president Henry

And in addition to the once-a-year |

oratory press crew turns out most
of the campus’ publications, posters
and pamphlets.

C. Harold Lauck heads this crew
of profesisonal printers.
under him are Lynwood Pullen, Ed-
ward Backus, Edwin Walker and
Don Tabbut.

The title “America’s Baskerville
Printer” was given Lauck several
years ago as a result of national
recognition he received for skillful
use of Baskerville type.

50 Years With Trade

Since his middle teens, Lauck has
been connected with the printing
business and has built up a back-
log of more than 50 years of ex-
perience. Next year he will be-
gin his 34th year at W&L.

Following an issue of the school

newspaper through the shop the
first person concerned with the
copy is the linotype operator, Lyn-

wood Pullen. Setting type for cam-
pus publications, he must often act
as proof reader and copy editor.
Next, the type goes to the skilled

130 papers in the United States. In
1945 he was appointed to cover the
fighting fronts in Italy, France and
Germany.

Since the end of the war, Childs
and his wife have used their Wash-
ington home as their base. In the
past 15 years he has made more than
36 trans-Atlantic flights, and has re-
ported first hand almost every ma-
jor diplomatic conference, interna-
national crisis and summit or near
summit meeting.

Authored Best-Seller

Childs is also the author of many
books, fiction and non-fiction. His
latest, “The Peacemakers,” is a
novel about the time of crisis in
top-level international diplomatic
circles. Earlier books include his
1958 non-fiction best-seller “Eisen-
hower: Captive Hero,” and others.

He has received many journalistic
honors, including the Sigma Delta
Chi award “for sustained insight in
international affairs, firsthand re-
porting, and effective writing.”

 

Classrooms and Printshop

To Move

The journalism department will be
moving into a new building over
the summer. Work began last June
on the remodeling of Reid Hall,
which will house of the department’s
facilities now located in Payne Hall
and in the old print shop.

Under Reid Hall’s new roof will
be facilities for: (1) Classrooms and
offices for basic instruction and re-
search programs related to the mass
media, public opinion and advertis-
ing. (2) Professional facilities in-
cluding news, printing, advertising
and film laboratories, wire room,
radio and television studios and
photographie studies. (3) Accommo-
dations for professional seminars. (4)
Offices for external services func-
tions such as administration of the
duPont radio-television awards and
SIPA. (5) Specialized library and
reading rooms and archives for au-
dio-visual materials.

Printshop Will Move

Present plans call for the ground
floor to contain a fullsized print shop.
All the equipment formerly used in
the journalism laboratory press will
be moved to the new structure. The
fourth floor will house several pho-
tographic darkrooms.

The second floor has been re-
modeled to include offices, class-
rooms, a library and _ conference
room.

The third floor will contain a reg-
ular newspaper city and wire room,
an advertising laboratory, film, tape
and record libraries and radio stu-
dios.

The department eventually plans
to broadcast from its own FM radio
station. Long range plans also call
for incorporating a television stu-
dio in the broadcasting facilities of
the department.

W. W. Coffey and Son, local con-
tractors, did the renovation.

The Department of Journalism and Communications this summer will
move its facilities into Reid Hall, now under renovation.

Backus often is assisted by Ed-

to doing the composing and running
the shop’s two smaller job presses,

The completed forms for the pap-
er then go to Don Tabbut. All five
men work in the small shop behind
Washington Hall. Steps are current-
ly being taken to expand the capa-
city for work which the print shop
can handle and recently a new
Linotype machine was added to the
shop’s equipment.

The list of awards won by Lauck
for his topographic skill includes a
Distinguished Service Citation at the
annual SIPA awards banquet “in
recognition of outstanding accom-
plishments in the field of scholas-
tic publishing and in acknowledge-
ment of devotion and effective serv-
ice to journalism, to education and
to youth.”

In the Inland Printer, the printing
industry’s leading trade journal,
Lauck has been featured as one of
the nation’s top typographical crafts-
men.

Some of his work was selected for
the 1964 Commercial Printing of the
Year Exhibition of the American In-
stitute of Graphic Arts. The exhibi-
tion, which traveled throughout the
nation, represented the work of some
200 out of 3,000 printers who en-
tered.

Until recently Lauck also con-
ducted classes for the journalism
department, teaching journalism stu-
dents the rudiments of type setting
and printing and explaining the var-
ious machines used in production of
printed materials.

This task is now being performed
by Edward Backus.
