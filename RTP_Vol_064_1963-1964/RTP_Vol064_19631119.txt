 

Assimilation Committee Should Be Abolished

Editor’s Note: The following let-
ter was composed by several mem-~
bers of the Assimilation Commit-
tee and the Executive Committee,
and it bears the signature of sev-
eral other students from those two
committees who have discussed it
with the originators.

To the Student Body:

It is the opinion of the under-
signed that there has arisen, over a
period of years, a pressing need for
a reappraisal of the Assimilation
Committee. The chief function of
the Committee, as is well known,
is to help preserve the traditions of
Washington and Lee— in particular
that tradition known as conventional
dress. We believe, however, that this
presents a paradox in terms. How
can conventional dress be a tradition
if, in fact, it must be enforced? The
obvious answer is that it cannct.

We are left with a rule rather
than a tradition. Thus, the purpose

 

of the Assimilation Committee may
be stated differently. The Committee
is an appointed group of students
whose duty is to enforce convention-
al dress. As it is set up, however, the
Committee merely punishes offend-
ers; the responsibility to inform the
committee of violations lies with the
student body. Therefore, it becomes
apparent that if the student body
does not support the Committee, the
Committee is an ineffectual organi-
zation, failing in its purpose.

Our opinion is that this is the
case at present. Probably less than
five per cent of the students re-
port violations with any semblance
of regularity. It is absurd to be-
lieve, then, that the student body
honestly supports the Assimilation
Committee. Why? Because they
believe, we think, that traditional
dress should be upheld as a tra-
dition, not enforced as a rule.
There is, and has been, a grow-

 

ing resentment towards the Com-
mittee and the “rule” of conven-
tional dress.

For these reasons we belive there
is a definite need for reappraisal
by the student body of the value
of this committee. As individuals we
have thoroughly considered the
problem, and as a group of individ-
uals we have come to a conclusion.

We should like to see the tradi-
tion of conventional dress establish-
ed and the rule eliminated. We be-
lieve the Assimilation Committee is
(1) unable to effectively enforce the
rule, and (2) by its existence is a
contradiction to the tradition. We
believe the Assimilation Commit-
tee should be disbanded.

We feel by doing so that gentle-
manly dress would become a tradi-
tion; that proper appearance would
become an ideal in which the stu-
dent body could take pride, rather
than a rule to which they take of-

 

fence. We believe that conventional
attire would become more meaning-
ful and certainly more respected.
Surely some might take advantage
of this new freedom were it allowed.
Yet we believe that exceptions will
be rare, if not because of desire to
abide by the tradition, because of
pure social pressure.

At the present time, the Univer-
sity of Virginia, even though it is
larger and less selective than W&L,
has conventional dress, and their
tradition is succeeding without an
enforcing body. The real fact is that
most Washington and Lee students
support the conventional dress now
because it is a tradition, and not
because it is a rule.

We believe that disbanding the
committee will eliminate com-
plaints about the rule, and help
destroy resentment towards gen-
tlemanly attire. It will leave the
tradition to stand on its own mer-

 

its to be supported by each indi-

vidual member of the student
body. If, however, the trandition
cannot stand, several facts will
have been illustrated: (1) that the
students body does not favor con-
centional dress, and (2) that the
administration, if it desires the
rule, will be responsible for en-
forcing it.

In summary, we will restate that
we do believe in gentlemanly dress
as a tradition. Proper attire is the
mark of a gentleman. It develops a
formal class atmosphere, and con-
duces to a serious attitude towards
education. It presents a pleasant,
mature appearance not only to the
students, but to the dates, parents,
alumni, and other campus visitors.
It illustrates that it is not necessary
to flout all convention in order to
keep one’s individuality.

We have studied the problem and
examined the apparent need. It is

our opinion that disbanding the
Assimilation Committee offers the
best solution. However, our main
concern is merely to express our
opinion so that you, the student
body, might be coaxed into reap-
praising the situation, and into de-
ciding for yourselves. We ask you
to make your own opinion known.

Sincerely,
Greg Euston, Junior Member,

Assimilation Committee; Stuart
Finestone, Freshman Member,

Committee; Chuck Griffin, Sopho-

‘Ballad Of Jesse Neighbor’ |
Story Read By Humphrey |

By HOWARD EPSTEIN
Tuesday Staff Reporter

Novelist William Humphrey, Glas-
gow visiting professor for the fall
term, delivered his first of fcur read-
ings on this campus yesterday by
reading “The Ballad of Jesse Neigh-
bor,” one of his recent short stories.

Mr. Humphrey, author of The
Last Husband, a collection of short
stories, and Home from the Hill,
presented a reading followed by an
informal discussion of several of his
methods of writing. The program
took place in the journalism class-
room of Payne Hall at 4 p.m.

Recent Theme

At the outset of the reading Mr.
Humphrey pointed out that “The
Ballad of Jesse Neighbor” was one
of several of his recent short stories
that concern the penniless Oklahoma
farmer of the 30’s who did not be-
come an overnight millionaire when
oil was discovered in the West.
His stories picture the lives of the
people to whom oil brought tragedy
instead of happiness.

Jesse Neighbor is a son of an in-
solvent Oklahoma farmer who owns
no land. His bride-to-be is the
daughter of a more wealthy farmer
who declares that Jesse must find a
home for his future family before
marriage. To achieve this end, Jesse
and his future bride work diligently
to secure the needed home: Jesse
stops smoking and saves his tobacco
money for a mule, he finds a share-
cropper’s cabin and land, and works
almost savagely with dedicated in-
dustry.

 

“Black Gold”

At this point, the story seems to
be one of the ambitious youth who
made his fortune with sweat and
patience, but it is here that Hum-
phrey adds the irony of “black gold.”
For instead of boosting Jesse to-
wards his goal, the discovery of oil
crushes his hopes and wastes his
efforts. Like many who have just
struck oil, the father of Jesse’s
future bride, rushes to the city and
returns a new man in a new class.
Marriage is now impossible.

With Jesse’s goal destroyed, his
life follows a steady decline until,
in search of fame and wealth, he
attempts to rob a bank. Caught, he is
tried, convicted of a capital offense,
and executed.

Glasgow Lecturer

Mr. Humphrey’s stay here for the
fall semester is sponsored by the
Glasgow Endowment Program.
which, since its birth in 1955, has
seen reside here such writers as
Katherine Anne Porter, John Ciardi,
and Merle Miller, along with Ed-
ward Albee, Richard Eberhart, Rob-
ert Lowell and Howard Nemerov.

During the rest of the fall term,
along with his lectures, Mr. Hum-
phrey has scheduled three more
readings: November 25, December
2, and 16. All of the readings will
be in the journalism classroom of
Payne Hall at 4 p.m.

Humphrey, a native of Texas, was
born in 1924. He taught at Bard
College for eight years. Since early
1961, Humphrey and his wife have
been living in Europe.

Negro Author
Packs Chapel

By ROGER PAINE
Editor-in-Chief
Ralph Ellison, author of
Invisible Man, delivered a
lengthy, discursive lecture on

Friday night to an audience
which almost filled the pews in Lee
Chapel. His topics ranged from child-
hood memories of friends named af-
ter Lee and Washington to a discus-
sion of sociology of early America,
to a final encomium for the late
William Faulkner.

No High Point

There was no center of attention
for Ellison’s talk—he dealt with
American literature in general, but
he mentioned very few authors by
name. In deed, although he alluded
to The Red Badge of Courage, to
Hemingway, and to Faulkner, most
often he left it up to the audience
to determine exactly what or whom
he was talking about.

Ellison said that the American ex-
perience, as he called it, began in a
land mass with plenty of room for
expansion. The framers of the consti-
tution had said exactly what sort
of nation they wanted, but their
ideals were to run up against the
irrevocable past. Speaking without
notes, Ellison said that America
found that she could postpone fac-
ing up to certain contradictions be-
tween her ideals as stated in the
constitution and the actual way of
life in the new states because the
country was expanding.

White Minstrels, Black Faces

Wandering to the development of
the “American” as opposed to the
“English” language, Ellison mem-
tioned the white minstrels of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
who absorbed the Negro way of us-
ing the language, the Negro songs,
etc. The mixture of black and white
started with white minstrels paint-
ing their faces black, and adopting
black mannerisms for their perfor-
mances, and the black minstrels
dressed like Uncle Sam.

Naming the nineteenth century as
the period in which American writ-
ers first began to try to define the
American ways of life—to “create
ourselves,” Ellison said that the
early novelists, while drawn into the
American ideal, were also insisting
| that the nation face up to certain re-
| alities, certain contradictions in her
way of life.

The Civil War

These contradictions came to a
| head in the War Between the States.
| Suddenly, said Ellison, Americans
who were committed to making a
more human way of life found that
they could not continue without
| warfare. When the clash occurred, it
| Was perahps the novelist who un-
derstood best what was happening.
“Glorious warfare” had come to an
end—“total warfare’ was the new
look. Both the poet and the novelist
saw this, and wrote about it.

The Civil War forced Americans
to face a problem which they could

THE RING-TUM PHI

The EC: Too Much Power?

This week, the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi completes its
introduction of current Executive Committeemen. We
should like also to glance briefly at the powers and func-
tions of the EC itself, and to comment upon those powers.

Actually, the EC is student government at Washing-
ton and Lee. It has absolute control, first of all, over the
execution of the Honor System. In addition to deciding
what a violation of the system is, and deciding as well
whether or not a particular incident constitutes a violation,
the EC has sole control over Honor System procedure—
thus it not only defends the system, but defines it.

Committees Controlled

Every student committee with any real governmental
powers is appointed by the 12 men on the Executive
Committee; furthermore, any decision of one of these
committees (Assimilation, Cold Check, Student Control
and Library), is subject to the EC’s veto. Also, the various
committees have no ultimate means of dealing with of-
fenders except turning them over to the EC.

(The only really functioning student committee not
appointed by the EC is the Publications Board, composed
of editors and business managers of campus publications
and two faculty members. But even here the EC has ulti-
mate authority. They can, if they so decide, oust any editor
or business manager appointed by the Publications

Board.)
No Structural Checks

Structurally, the EC has no checks on it whatsoever.
Press representation at meetings, while nominally allowed,
really is controlled by the Committee. At any time, the
Committee can decide to go into “executive session,”
which means any outsiders must be expelled from EC
chambers.

While certain instances would appear to warrant pri-
vate meetings, the EC has to give no reasons, no explana-
tions for executive session, and could theoretically de-
clare every meeting closed.

‘Its Own Authority’

Let’s view for a moment what we have just observed.
The Executive Committee has absolute authority in every
realm of student government. It is executive, in that it
enforces rules and regulations; it is legislative, in that it
creates committees and defines rules of behavior; and it
is judicial, in that it judges violations and interprets regu-
lations.

It is its own source of authority, its own source of
control—the EC defines its own scope of influence, and
decides what controls should be exercised over it; thereby
controlling the potential “controls” over it.

These 12 men, then, have for all practical purposes
the power to manipulate as they so choose the whole of
student governmental activity.

Who are they, how are they chosen, and do they
really represent the student body?

Candidate Selection

The Executive Committee candidates are chosen by
the party cliques — Progressive and University; this
amounts to nine fraternity representatives in each party,
in one evening’s political dealings, coming up with a slate
of candidates. The student body is then allowed to elect
“representatives” from the candidates that the two bodies
of nine men have selected for them. At least three of the
EC members—the law school representatives—are not di-
rectly attached to the student body and among the three
of them represent 100 law students, many of whom were
not at W&L as undergraduates. On the present commit-
tee, two of the three law representatives did not spend
their undergraduate careers here.

It appears from the above that what we have is not a
representative student government at all. We put in the
hands of a select few men absolute authority over us.

Power Distribution Necessary

Our criticism here is not with the committee members;
they, we feel sure, live up to their responsibilities as con-
scientiously as possible. Our criticism is, rather, with the
structure—we feel that too much power is in the hands of
too few students; we feel that there are more than 12
qualified leaders at Washington and Lee; we feel that a
distribution of powers would serve to democratize student
government, provide necessary checks on the EC, and re-
vitalize student interest in that it would give them the
opportunity for political activity and expression they are
denied now.

Next week, we shall amplify just what we mean by

“distribution of powers,” suggesting some concrete pos-
sibilities for modifying the present system.

Conservatives Evaluate New Bill
In Light of State Voting Rights

By WILLIAM BRAITHWAITE
and WAYTT D. DURETTE, JR.

We were asked to comment this
week on the Civil Rights Bill.

Let us specify at the beginning
what we argue about: it is not the
morality or immorality of any kind
of discrimination on the basis of
race, but rather the way the law
shall deal, if at all, with such dis-
crimination. It is, in a word, the
means, and not the ends, of which
we speak.

Unconstitutional

We believe the bill would be an
unconstitutional assumption by the
federal government of the states’
power to determine voter qualifica-
tions, that it would wrongly invoke
the 14th amendment, and that it
would distort even further the al-
ready topsy-turvy interpretation of
the commerce clause.

And perhaps most important, by
opening to federal regulation areas
of heretofore private activity, it
would undermine the fundamental
human right to own and control
private property.

(Space limits us to commenting on
only those two of the bill’s seven
titles which we consider crucial.)

Voting Rights

Title I—Voting Rights—lays down
federal standards for use of state
literacy tests, and further provides,
arbitrarily, that any person com-
pleting the sixth grade shall be

deemed to have “sufficient literacy,
comprehension and intelligence to
vote in any federal election.”

Our objection: from Article I of
the Constitution and the several
amendments relating to voting (12,
15, 17, 19), it is plain that the voter
qualifications are to be set by the
states, subject only to the restric-
tions of the amendments cited.

The Civil Rights bill in setting a
federal standard of voter qualifica-
tion, is therefore a clear violation
of the Constitution.

Public Accommodations

Title II—Public Accommodations—
Invoking the 14th amendment and
the commerce clause, this section
prohibits discriminatory practices
which “take on the character of
action by the States,” or which are
practiced by business a substantial
portion of whose goods have moved
in interstate commerce.

Our objection: first, the 14th
amendment provides “No _ state
shall....” The bill reasons that if
the state licenses or protects a busi-
ness through laws or ordinances,
then the business’s actions “take on
the character” of state action.

This reasoning, which makes a
state agency of every business from
hotdog stands to General Motors,
destroys the traditional distinction
between private property and pub-
lic agency. We categorically deny
that this was, or is, within the in-
tended ambit of the 14th amendment.

Four More Outstanding E.C. Representatives

 

JOHN M. MADISON, JR.

John Madison is a senior repre-
sentative from the undergraduate
school. His grade point ratio last
semester was 2.2. He is currently
the head dermitery counselor in the
freshman dorm, a tri-captain of the
varsity football team, a member of
the Steering Committee for the Mock
Convention, and secretary of Beta
Theta Pi Fraternity. John hopes to
take up law at Louisiana State Uni-
versity after graduation.

 

CHARLES B. ROWE

“Jim” Rowe is the senior Repre-
sentative from the law school. He
did his undergraduate work at Ran-
dolph-Macon College in Ashland,
Virginia. Jim is an associate editor
of the Law Review, a member of
the Steering Committee for the
Mock Convention, a member of Phi
Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa,
and he is a dormitory counselor.

Rowe has represented the law
school on the E.C. for two years.

Complsion to Buy?

Second, invoking the commerce
clause, the bill extends to nearly
every business the “compulsion to
sell,” rule heretofore limited to pub-
lic utilities. Why not, as logically, a
compulsion to buy?

For example, ten whites boycott
a store compelled by injunction to
serve a Negro; does not their action
have ten times the “substantial ef-
fect on interstate commerce” as the
serving of one Negro? (Such a re-
sult is easily possible in many
Southern cities.) Under the logic of
this bill, why not compel the ten
whites to resume trading at that
store?

Absurd? Yes, that’s what we think.

Right to Discriminate

We do not defend racial ciscrimi-
nation. We do urge, and strenously,
that the right to discriminate is the
sine qua non of individual liberty.

Our views on this point, which we
regard as the crucial one, are best
expressed in this recent comment
by a noted author and lecturer:

“The American system does not
rest upon some ‘right to be right,’
as some legislative majority may de-
fine what is ‘right.’ It rests solidly
upon the individual’s right to be
wrong—upon his right in his person-
onal life to be capricious, arbitrary,
prejudiced, biased, opinionated, un-
reasonable—upon his right to act as
a free man in a free society.”

ve

JAMES E. KULP

Jim Kulp is the intermediate law
school representative to the Execu-
tive Committee. His undergraduate
work was completed at Hampden-
Sydney College. At Hampden-
Sydney Jim was a member of Chi
Phi Fraternity and was named to
Omicron Delta Kappa.

Last Spring Kulp was the Univer-
sity Party candidate for vice-presi-
dent of the student body. He was
defeated by a narrow margin.

I have been amused by the recent
conversations I have heard about sex
around the campus. Now that Gal-
braith has cleared the air for us, the
moral fervor of our guardians takes
on a rather pathetic quality—but no
less pathetic is the fervent theorizing
of my freshman friends when their
actual experience is brought to
light. Most of the people I know are
too reflective to make good Don

to know anything about it.

This winter has been so mild that
it seems to have thrown the
student body into a fit of anxiety.
Usually the switch from summer
clothing to Harris Tweed is a clear-

sufficing to effect a complete change-
over. But with the weather we have
been having, no one knows where he
stands. Now it is cold, and out come
the topcoats; the next day will see
a flush of madras. If you misjudge
the weather in the morning, noon
will be sure to bring your complete

the press, Negro author Ralph El-
lison visited our campus and gave
his lecture: “The Novel and the
American Experience.” It was very
disappointing.

Perhaps those who came were ex-
pecting a more exciting fare—but
Ellison’s talk, which rambled on for
almost an hour and a half, said little
more than one could cull out of the
pages of a College Outline Series n
American literature.

Saturday, November 16

Today we had the last of the foot-
ball weekends. Overheard at a fra-
ternity house: a social chairman ex-
horting the freshmen to “put on a
good show. At least look like you’re
having a good time. It looks bad
when people’ aren’t partying
enough.” If a house is having trouble
with its parties, maybe it could hire
professionals, mercenaries as it were,
to liven things up, and then every-
one else could sit back and not have
to worry about it. I have nothing
against combos, but this combined
effort to produce forced fun leaves
me cold.

Sackett Scores Sixteen Points
As W&L Whips Lynx, 36-12

By JIM CROTHERS

Tuesday Sports Editor
Not only did W&L halfback Henry Sackett win the Ty
Rauber Homecoming Award at halftime for his outstanding
play against Centre several weeks ago, the Lynchburg senior
also led the Generals to a 36-12 swamping of Southwestern

Saturday in a CAC contest.

Sackett carred 15 times for 117
yards (that’s 7.8 yards per carry) in
his final W&L home game, scoring
16 points to increase his seasonal

        

d

Yoffe Sackett
total to 46 points. Fourtcen of these
tallies came in the second quarter
when the Generals scored all but
8 of their points.

Washington and Lee recovered a
first period Lynx fumble and Stuart
Yoffe began the scoring with a 28-
yard gallop to paydirt;Sackett add-
ing the two extra points. South-
western came right back however,
with Bert Chafin tossing to end Ray
Baker for the visitor’s first six-
pointer and Chafin’s try for the two
pointer failed, giving W&L an 8-6
first period lead.

Fullback Sid Butler led the
Washington and Lee second quarter
onslaught with an eight-yard plunge
for the Generals’ second tally. Soon
afterwards, Sackett, too, found run-
ning room up-the-middle and gal-
loped 60 yards for the touchdown
making the score 20-6.

A 47-yard pass from Quarterback
John McDaniel to Tri-Captain end
Buck Ogilvie set up the fourth W&L
TD, and Sackett skirted end for
the final two yards. Butler then
made the score 28-6 with a success-
ful two-pointer. The red team was
not to be outdone, however, and
came back to score just as the half
ended on a 15-yard aerial from A.
J. Barranco to halfback Bill David.
This same passing combination,
which accounted for three of the
four General completions, worked
on the two-point conversion attempt
to give the Minks a 36-6 half-time
margin .

The same Chafin-to-Baker com-
bination accounted for Southwest-
ern’s final points and the lone
second-half score. This win brings
the Generals’ season mark to 5-3, as-
suring them of their fourth straight
winning campaign, with the final
game to be played against Wash-
ington University of St. Louis.

The “Battling Bears” met with
their first defeat last week at Se-
wanee, 14-13, but up until that
time were ranked as the 11th best
small college football team in the
U.S. By virtue of Sewanee’s victory
last Saturday, they won the CAC
title and next Saturday’s W&L vs.
Washington U. contest will be a bat-
tle for the runner-up position.

struck in an unexpected place as| #

the Washington and Lee soccer team
finished a disappointing fourth in
the Virginia State Tournament at

the University of Virginia Friday and | *

Saturday.

After an opening game victory
over VPI, 4-0, the Generals dropped
a tough one to Lynchburg by the
same score as their regular season
defeat, 1-0. In the battle for third
and fourth they were upset by Roa-
noke, 2-0; Roanoke had succumbed
to the Generals, 4-1, seven days be-
fore.

Virginia went on to defeat Lynch-
burg in the finals and retain their
championship. The game was tied 1-1
at the end of regulation play, and
neither team was able to score in
two five-minute overtimes. Virginia
was given the victory by virtue of
having had more corner kicks dur-
ing the overtime period. VPI whip-
ped Randolph-Macon for fifth place.

The Generals coasted to victory
in the opener with Preben Berthel-
sen and goalie Tom Green leading
the way. Bethelsen scored two goals
and assisted on another, while Green
blanked the Gobblers. The Tech-
men almost averted the shutout on
a penalty kick, but Green made a
great save to protect his whitewash
job. Jim Mell and Steve Hibbard
accounted for the other two goals,
while Hibbard and Tim Henry pick-
ed up assists.

Lynchburg was lucky to get away
with a victory against W&L. The
winners’ one goal was knocked in
by a W&L player when his head shot
of a corner kick went astray and
got by General goalie Green. It
was one of many tough breaks to go
against them during the tournament.

The Roanoke defeat was probably

Light Brigade
Hands Defeat

Lo Hargrave

By MARC WINSTON
Tuesday Sports Writer

Friday afternoon the Light Brigade
came through with a big win over
Hargrave Military Academy which
gave them the first winning record in
several years of W&L freshman
football. The score was a convincing
22-6 for the Baby Generals who won
their last four straight games after
dropping their initial two contests.

W&L opened the scoring in the
first period. After recovering a
fumble on the Hargrave thirty yard
line, John Bogart burst through the
line and went the rest of the way
for the score. Rob Reading converted
to make it 7-0. W&L got its second
score of the afternoon when Phil
Claxton took a punt on his own
forty yard line and sprinted all the
way for six. Again Reading success-
fully converted and the Baby Gen-
erals left the field at half-time with
a 14-0 lead.

Hargrave came back for a score in
the third period. The touchdown
came when Riddle gathered in a pass
and eluded several members of the
W&L secondary on a play that
covered twenty yards. The conver-
sion attempt failed. The Baby Gen-
erals sewed up the victory in the
fourth period when Bryant Ken-
drick threw twenty yards to Hank
Hendrickson for the third W&L
score. Bogart ran the extra point
to make the final total 22-6.

(Head Paces X-Country Win;
Kilpatrick, O’ Connor Picked

Not only did Charlie Head set a new Washington and Lee
cross-country course record of 24:10 minutes in Saturday’s
overwhelming 18-45 victory over Fairmont College (W. Va.),
but that win gave the General harriers a 6-1 season record, the
best in the history of W&L cross-country.

The swift senior runner bested the old record, set by Mike
* Shank, by a full ten seconds, and

was followed closely in this last
meet by season standouts Riff
O’Connor, Andy Kilpatrick, and Bill
Wildrick. Because of their consis-

tancy and hard work, Kilpatrick, a
a junior, and O’Connor, a sophomore,
were elected last night as next
year’s cross-country captains.

This season’s 6-1 mark bettered the
6-2 mark gained in both ’61 and ’62,
and gives Washington and Lee an
overall record since 1921 in fall
running of 80-86-2.

Harrier Coach Dick Miller noted
that the lack of one exceptionally
fast man hurt the Generals in the
state meet. But he also felt that the
strength of the team in dual meets
stemmed largely from the depth
and closeness of the times.

Prospects for next season look
bright with only Head graduating
and several good freshmen, Bob
Brown, John and Clint Morse, and
Dick Robinson returning to take
up the slack. Other harriers return-
ing include: Robin Dyer, Clyde
Foshee, Gene Hatfield, Lee Johnson,
Scott Kennedy, Bob Patton, Chuck
Walker, and Ed Wood.

Ellison Talks Of Continuing ‘Civil War’

(Continued from page 1)
not solve, Ellison continued, and so
after the North had won, it turned
away from any forthright concern
with what the war had been about.
It was, therefore, a moral defeat.
This is pointed out in Stephen
Crane’s Red Badge of Courage, in
which there is not a single reference
to the issues over which the war was
fought. The whole story, as Ellison
pointed out, is about an individual
and his search to find himself and
stay alive in a struggle he had not
made and did not understand.
Crane’s novel showed, better than
anything else, “the civil war Amer-
ica had become after the Civil War.”

The Modern Writers

From this point, Ellison went on
to talk about the development of
American rhetoric, especially where
the lost generation after World War
I was concerned. Hemingway was
mentioned only insofar as he stayed
away from the central conflict be-
tween the northern and southern
states. Faulkner, on the other hand,
decided he could not forget what
the war had been about. “The South

had never forgotten the war, the
North had never remembered it—but
Faulkner remembered it, a1.d knew
how to deal with it.”

The remainder of Ellison’s lecture
was devoted to praise for Faulkner.
He put the novel back on the track
it had left after the Civil War. Be-
cause of Faulkner’s influence, the
novel struck once again at reality,
it hit through the stereotype to the
reality of human life.

 

Ending with a challenge, Ellison
said that the American novelist must
have the courage to “tell the truth,
whatever the truth might be, pas-
sionately and eloquently.” The nov-
elist must present the complexities
of human life in their most human
form. Faulkner wrestled with time,
memory, and human passion, and
made form and art out of these
things. At least, said Ellison, we had
him.

 

Soccermen Place
(Continued from page 3)

caused by a letdown more than any-
thing else. The Generals were so
disappointed by their fluke defeat at
the hands of Lynchburg that they
couldn’t get up much enthusiasm for
the game. It was rather a lackluster
affair. To add to this problem, the
Generals also had a long list of in-
juries from the preceding games.

Coach Joe Lyles had laudatory

remarks about his defense. He com-
mented on the fine play of his full-
backs, Redmond, Pete Preston, and
Howard Busse. He also applauded
the play of Green, which was hardly
unusual. Hibbard and Wes Horner
also received the coach’s compli-
ments.
For the season the Generals fin-
ished with a 7 and 5 record. They
outscored their opponents, 31-17, but
were unable to win many of the
close ones. Berthelsen finished as
the team scoring leader by a wide
margin. He tallied 11 goals and five
assists for 16 points. The nearest man
to him was Henry with nine points.
Lyles next year will be to find a
replacement for Green. Lyles can-
not expect to come up with a goalie
of Green’s calibre, but he may have
trouble finding even a suitable sub-
stitute. Sophomore Bob Larus is the
heir apparent to the job, but he is
of unknown quality because of his
lack of varsity game competition.

Other members who will be leav-
ing the club are Mell and Berthelsen,
two of the main cogs in the attact.
The loss of these two is particularly
upsetting to Lyles because he had a
shortage of wings to begin this sea-

son. There is also some question as
to the eligibility of Chris Clarke for
next season. Clarke will be a second
semester senior then and may not be
allowed to play. Although Lyles
would like to have Clark back, he
does have Charlie Sweet in reserve.
Still, the big task will be replacing
Green.

The Executive Committee of the

weeks ago which struck me as a
very good idea: they published for
the benefit of the students a mimeo-
graphed sheet containing the pro-
cedure which is followed in the in-
vestigation and trial of an honor vio-
lation. These sheets are available in
the Student Union on the first
floor—sitting on a table on the left
side of the UCA room. They have
not been paid the attention which
they deserve.
