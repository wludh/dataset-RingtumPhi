EC To Pick
Recipient
Of Award

By MIKE HASH
Assistant News Editor

Established last February by the
Executive Committee, the Dean
Frank J. Gilliam Award is given
annually to the one student who is
considered by the EC as_ having
made a valuable contribution to stu-
dent affairs. It is not necessary that
the student make this contribution
through any office or organization,
and the achievement may take the
form of outstanding work in one or
several fields.

The award consists of $200 to the
recipient, and $150 to be given to
some organization or department
within the University as designated
by the recipient and approved by
the BC. The money
from the student bedy fund.

March 23 Deadline

Nominations for the award are
presently being received by the EC
from any member of the student
body or faculty. The nominations
must be submitted no later than
Monday, March 23 to the President
of the student body.

Announcement of the recipient
will be made by the EC in early
spring. A permanent plaque placed
in the Student Union is engraved
with the name of each winner. Any
student in the University is con-
sidered as a possible recipient of
the award.

First Recipient

The perpetual scholarship was first
awarded to Tom Rains, 1963 gradu-
ate, who received the award on
the basis of his work as chairman
of the Student Control Committee.
Rains designated part of the Award
for use in the Moffatt Seminar
Room.

Given solely on the basis of serv-
ice to the school, rather than in
consideration of need, the Gilliam
Award recognizes the many years of
outstanding service which Dean Gil-
liam has given to the University.
The award also emphasizes an area
not previously recognized by the
faculty or student body.

Samuel Goldwyn, je. Io Speak :
To W&L Audience On Thursday

A man with one of the famous
names in the motion picture indus-

try will lecture at Washington and |
Lee at 7:30 p.m. Thursday in Payne |

Hall.

He is Samuel Goldwyn, Jr., son of
one of the most celebrated producers
in film history and now a producer-
director in his own right.

Goldwyn will speak Thursday on
“The Motion Picture Today.”

He will also speak to students
taking the Journalism Department’s
course, “An Introduction to the Mo-
tion Picture,” at 9:20 am. Friday.
O. W. Riegel, chairman of the Jour-
nalism Department and instructor of
the motion picture course under
whose auspices Goldwyn is appear-
ing, said visitors will be welcome
at the class meeting.

In the Friday morning class Gold-
wyn will discuss his recently com-
pleted but unreleased film, The

 

Young Lovers. He is making his de-
but as a producer-director with this
film which is set in a large, modern
university and stars Peter Fonda,
Nick Adams, Sharon Nugueny and
Deborah Walley.

Goldwyn grew up in Hollywood
and then graduated from the Uni-
versity of Virginia in 1957. He began
his film-making career as a produc-
er-director of documentary films for
NATO. One of these received first
prize in the documentary class at
the Edinburg Film Festival in 1952
and he was awarded a special com-
mendation by President Eisenhower.

After spending some time as a
producer-director of live television
in New York, Goldwyn returned
to Hollywood as an independent mo-
tion picture producer.

Among his films are Proud Rebel,
Huckleberry Finn, The Shark Fight-
ers and Man With a Gun,

COLVIN

The Troubadour Theatre will present The Tragical History
of Dr. Faustus Thursday through Sunday nights, March 5-8.
This, the second play of the season, will celebrate the 400th
anniversary of the birth of its author, Christopher Marlowe.

This famous play involves the plight of Faustus, a scholar

 

learned in law, medicine and theol-*
ogy, who takes up the study of magic
to feed his pride. To satisfy his
burning thirst for knowledge and
power, he agrees to sell his soul to
the devil Mephistophilis, for twenty-
four years of super-human power.
From this point on, his career is
marked by a great waste of his gen-
ius upon cheap trickery in the lavish
courts of the Emperor, Carolus V,
and the Pope of Rome.

Morton Heads Cast

Heading the cast of 25 is Tim Mor-
ton in the role of Dr. Faustus. Re-
membered for his roles in Othello,
Zoo Story, and Inherit the Wind,
Morton will make his first appear-
ance of the season. Accompanying
Morton will be Steve Colvin who

Concert Series Slates
Strauss Opera Here

The Canadian Opera Company of
Toronto, Canada, will appear in
Lexington this week. The appear-
ance will be the second event of the
Rockbridge Concert-Theatre Series.

This group, Canada’s premiere
professional operatic repretory com-
pany will present their production
of John Strauss’ Die Fledermaus at
Waddell School on Wednesday,
March 4, at 8:15 p.m.

Makes Annual Tour
Organized in 1950, the Canadian
Company formed a charter opera
division in 1958 which has annually
toured the eastern United States as
well as Canada.

 

Members of the Company appear-
ing here in Strauss’ comic opera are
Alan Crofoot as Alfred, Sheila Pier-
cey as Adele, Constance Fisher as
Rosalinda and Cornelius Opthof as
Baron Bisentein,

Other Actors and Roles

Joseph Macko will play Dr. Blind
and Ivan; Peter Van Ginkel will
play Dr. Falke; and William Cope-
land will sing the role of Frank,
the prison warden. Phil Starke sings
Prince Orlofsky.

The musical direetor and pianist
for this production is W. James
Craig and the general director is
Herman Geiger-Torel. The Opera
will be sung in English.

 

will play Mephistophilis, the devil
agent of hell. He has acted in Othel-
lo, Krapp’s Last Tape, and most re-
cently as Eisenring in Biedermann
and the Firebugs.

Also to be seen in one of his rare
appearances is Dr. Keith Shillington,
Associate Professor of Chemistry at
W&L. Dr. Shillington will play the
role of Gluttony, one of the Seven
Deadly Sins.

Female Roles Filled

Faustus will feature two Lexing-
ton High School students, Kendall
Jamison and Betsy Letcher. Miss
Jamison will play the part of Helen
of Troy whom Faustus conjures up
to be his lover. Miss Letcher will
play two parts, following the Eliza-
bethan custom of doubling roles. She
will first appear as one of the Seven
Deadly Sins who come from hell to
delight Faustus with tales of them-
selves, and later as the beauteous
paramour of Alexander the Great.
Both girls have been active in Trou-
badour and L.H.S. productions.

Low Comic Roles

To add some fun to an evening
of high tragedy several actors, will
appear in low comic roles, which
were included to please the cruder
tastes of Elizabethan audiences. Joe
Volpe, seen last Fall as Schmitz in
Biedermann, will play two roles:
first as the hapless Horsecoarser
who is doubly outwitted by crafty
Faustus, and secondly as the not-so-
pious Pope whom Faustus taunts
at his court in Rome.

Lockhart Handley will double as
the Clown and Robin, both of whom
find that fooling with magic can
have unpleasantly surprising results.
No less surprised are Rafe, a mis-
chievous cohort of Robin’s played
by Lew Davis, and the incredulous
Vinter, played by Sid Parham. Their
anties are contrasted to the sincerity
of such a figure as the Old Man,
portrayed by Starke Syndor.

Additional Cast Members

Adding splendor to the spectacle
are Pete Stelling in the role of Em-
peror Carolus V, Gay Reading and
John Moore, who double as the sor-
cerers Valdes and Cornelius, and
later as Lucifer and Beelzebub, and
the Seven Deadly Sins, played by

and Lee Chapter was established in
1911.

Membership in the Society is an
honor conferred in recognition of
scholarly attainment in the liberal
arts and sciences. In electing new
members the Society considers but
two criteria—scholarship and char-
acter.

 

UCA Expands ‘Pulpit Program’
To Supply 3 Pastors in March

The University Christian Asso-
ciation, under the leadership of Beta
Chuck Long and Dr. Louis Hodges,
has expanded its program of supply
pastor work.

Throughout recent years, members
of the UCA have filled pulpits in
the Rockbridge County area which
have been vacant. This month W&L
students will conduct services and
deliver sermons in three Methodist
churches in Fairfield, Buchanan, and
Buena Vista.

Leadership Forum will meet to-
night at 7 in Evans Dining Hall to

, have found it impossible to take care
of all the churches in their circuit.
In one ease, a Methodist minister
has six churches in his circuit. The
UCA will supply three of these
churehes each Sunday in March,
while the minister himself serves
the other three, on a rotating basis.

This system has made it possible
for most pulpits in Rockbridge
County to be filled every Sunday.

About ten W&L students are in-
volved in UCA weekend activities
regularly, and more than ten in
addition make contributions to the
program once every two weeks. The
| UCA’s normal activities include the
| handling of church services at Clark
| Mountain Church, aid and instruc-
; tion to patients of Western State,
| and the tutoring and maintenance of
| a Boy Scout troop at the Boys’ Home
| in Covington.

Workers Of The School—Arise
Now Is The Hour Of Need

No W&L student, however apathetic, could possibly
overlook the vigor with which the Buildings and Grounds
people have attacked two of W&L’s persisting local prob-
lems: what to do with the “old co-op,” and how to provide
the University community with more convenient parking
space. The nature of the “‘attack”’ suggests that somebody
up there doesn’t think any problem exists.

Therefore, (not wanting to be critical, mind you),
we must ruefully observe that not only is Washington and
Lee’s foreign policy antiquated (e.g., refusal to recognize
the Negro race), but the University’s domestic policies
are also at a standstill. It’s possible that potential legisla-
tion is being tied up by the Rules Committee; or, it’s pos-
sible that the imaginations of those responsible for build-
ings and grounds are still in neutral.

We think that it’s time this school got moving again!
The challenge of the ’60’s must be answered! The Old
Co-op Bill and the Parking Bill aren’t so controversial that
they couldn’t be aired in this session—then at least we’d
know that some action might be taken by 1974. And the
fact that most of our allies (Sewanee, Randolph-Macon,
Duke, Wake Forest) have recognized the Negro race
ought to make us think about that problem too.

If W&L’s battalion of leaf-rakers, snow-shovelers,
and manure-spreaders would lift their heads out of the
ground they’re supposed to keep green, and put in an
eight-hour instead of four-hour day, perhaps we could
anticipate a campus this spring as beautiful as we've all
been told our campus is. Perhaps the grass would actually
be green. Perhaps the unsightly, over-filled trench which
has scarred the front campus for the past few months
would be graded and reseeded.

Remember, Buildings and Grounds Dep’t: the times
are too grave, the challenge too urgent, and the stakes too
high—to permit the customary passions of three-hour

lunch breaks.

 

Current Cinema

Nominations for Awards
Point up Cinema Polttics

By TOM PACE

What price, Norton? I wonder what some people mean when
they talk about romantic irony. I am beginning to have reservations
about recommending “Soldiers in the Rain,” but there is so much
good in it that one can easily overlook the bad. Why is everybody
so down on “Cleopatra”? It seems that you have to climb to one
side or the other, when, in fact, it is better to ride the fence. “Cleo-
patra” has some nice things in it.

The story isn’t bad. And contrary to what appears to be general
opiinon, Richard Burton is quite good as Mare Antony. Admittedly
it is overlong—way overlong—and Blizabeth Taylor is not well cast
nonetheless, judgment has been too hasty. Whether or not to go
depends on what you would do with the three and a half hours
if you didn’t go than on anything else. There is no reason to be
bitter simply because the movie isn’t the best ever made. Only
three or four of those are made each year.

The More Deserving?

The Academy Award nominations this year have proved, more
conclusively than ever before, that they are worthless judgments
of merit. “Tom Jones” was not the best movie of the year, but the
Academy has cleverly arranged it so that “Tom Jones” will get the
award by nominating much lesser films against it. Why ignore “Hud,”
“The Great Escape,” “The L-Shaped Room,” “This Sporting Life,”
“814.” “The Victors,’ “The Wrong Arm of the Law,” “Soldiers in
the Rain,” “Charade,” and “The Prize,” some of which were not the
best, but all of which were superior to that sloppy, little “Lilies of
the Field,” that sloppy, big “How the West Was Won,” and the
controversial “Cleo.” Why nominate Rex Harrison, Albert Finney
(who might well have won for “Saturday Night and Sunday Morn-
ing,” but not for “Tom Jones”), and Sidney Poitier, only to ignore
Steve McQueen, Marcello Mastroianni, and Jackie Gleason, to name
a few more deserving?

The answer is very simple. Because the Academy must pay hom-
age to the money-wielding producers and the New York film critics,
all of whom deserve much less. There is really no festival which
gives noteworthy honors, with the possible exception of the Lon-
don Film Festival. You must be satisfied with giving your own rec-
ognition which, sadly, the receivers cannot appreciate.

Strangelove

Once in a long while, however, a film does come along which both
merits and receives praise. Such a film is “Dr. Strangelove: or How
I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.” And if “Strange-
love” is ignored next year by the award-givers, it will more than
make up for this by being one of the biggest box-office successes
for the last five years. This is a movie that may be recommended
with only one qualification; if your father or uncle is a general you
may be hurt.

The one film in town this week really worth seeing is playing
for the last time tonight. It is “This Sporting Life,” and is at the
Lyric. Coming soon to the Lyric is “La Notte,” the second of An-
tonioni’s trilogy, and perhaps the finest film which will come to
Lexington this Spring.

Tony Walker is perhaps the campus’s most proli-

scripts that is by no means thin, infused with his own
personal, yet effective, imagery and language. I have
picked these two pieces because thy show his charac-
teristic concern with death and life in the senses
coupled with his experimental style and diction.

A FRAGMENT

Though some unthought chasm will inhale

All this life, our frail existence:

Brown, cinnabar, earth red; colors of the mood,
Soundless tones on chords of cool autumn air.

And the crescent moon,

Leaving behind the night of some other land,
Fills one moment-point in all the black-hood of cold

With musty light golden.

Has come into the sky as the guardian

Of fountain, spring, and hunter.

Has thrown warm beams down the hallway

From dome, ‘to corridor and passage

Into ‘the winter, severed from autumn
The moon has undergone the exchange

From crescent to the cold facade

Agree or Disagree -It’s on the Way

By ROD COCKSHUTT

Although it may not look like it
now, it’s inevitable. No matter how
strongly we may
feel about the
whole thing we
can be certain it
is coming to
Washington and
Lee in the very
» near future, just
| as it is coming to
the rest of Amer-
ica.

Consequently, it
would seem irrel-
evant and unnec-
essary to argue about whether we
want it or not, or whether we're
ready for it or not. It’s coming.
That’s final.

In the light of all this, then, it

seems to me that this ought to
be a time of honest soul-searching

and preparation. What can we as
students at Washington and Lee do
to make the transition easier, for
adjustments will surely have to
be made.

We must ask ourselves how the
fraternities will react, for instance.
What changes will be made in the
social life of the students? How will
the athletic teams take it? I predict
that some of them will disband for
a while, but that others will cer-
tainly take their place. Some stu-
dents will come to class less than
they have been, but that’s to be
expected. I feel certain, however,
that not a single student will drop
out of school because of it all. Stu-
dents at Washington and Lee are
bound to be above that kind of ac-
tion.

But we do have to face it. The
whole appearance of the University
will be changed by this single event.

I personally believe that it will be
an improvement, and ‘that the school
and the town, will be more pleas-
ant to be in when it happens. But
then you may disagree with me.

To all those who still adamant-
ly believe it will never come to
Washington and Lee, and to those
who are unalterably opposed to
it we can offer little consolation.
The issue has been settled and
I feel certain that the trustees and
Administration are reconciled to it
as well. Some of them may even
be anxious for it. It is therefore
our responsibility as students to
try to face up to this as educated
men and without undue emotion-
alism. In the end it is bound to
bring more pleasure than pain,
and more warmth and beauty to
to the University.

Yes, to be sure, it is coming. Spring
is coming soon.

 

The Revolution Of ’63

 

HaveSouthern Negroes Really Changed?
The “Myth’and the New Negro Outlook

Editor’s Note: The following ar-
ticle was written by Dr. Louis
Hodges, W&L Department of Re-
ligion, for the Waynesboro News-
Virginian. It is the first of a series
of articles under the general
heading, “The Revolution of ’63.

By LOUIS W. HODGES

The events of last summer have
prompted the apt label, “The Revo-
lution of ’63.” Bloody demonstra-
tions in Birmingham have caught the
eye of the nation. Atlanta road-
blocks, Danville protests, Washing-
ton marches, federalized National
Guard at the University of Alabama,
bombs in churches, funerals for four
young Negro girls, fire hoses, paddy
wagons, protest posters— these are
the tangible symbols of the revo-
lution.

Negro Behaves Differently

But what does the revolution it-
self symbolize? What is new in ’63,
something not fully present in ear-
lier decades? Above all else the new
ingredient is the changed Negro.
The Negro of the 60’s is radically

different from the Negro of the
50’s in one essential respect: he has
found new power and determination
to press for his rights. He behaves
differently. This simple but deeply
important fact has prompted a wag
to read N.A.A.C.P., “Niggers Ain’t
Acting like Colored People.”
There must be no mistake about
it; the Negro has no new desires or
needs. He has always been restless,
and the South has always been dim-
ly aware, though not fully conscious,
of that fact. We have tried to forget
the powder keg beneath. Toward
that end we have devised special
myths to give ourselves assurance.

The Southern Myth

One of the most comforting myths
handed me as a boy in Mississippi
went something like this: “Our Nig-
gers are happy like they are. They
don’t want to mix with white folks.
Eleanor Roosevelt is just trying to
make trouble among our Niggers.
They know their place and are hap-
py to stay in it.”

The Negro was glad to have the

white power structure believe this
myth. He was anxious to play the
role of “Uncle Tom,” to be the
“good Nigger.” To have done other-
wise would have brought down the
wrath of the white, maybe in mild
form and maybe in the form of a
lynching. The Negro tried to appear
happier than he actually was, and
for good reason.

Revolution Has Begun
Things have changed. The Negro
is not so helpless as before, and he
knows it. He no longer plays the
role of “Uncle Tom.” The revolu-
tion is on. Self-deception becomes
increasingly difficult for the white.
The Klan, the Councils, and the
noose are proving ineffective, and
the white feels helpless without

these time-honored methods.

In the future we may expect fur-
ther outbreaks of violence in a futile
attempt to put the Negro “back in
his place.” These will not work; we
are dealing with a new Negro. Here-
in lies the root of the revolution of
63.

  
    

Coun Syuire :
By ADDISON BROCKENBROUGH

“Addison Goes to Sem”

Last Saturday evening, the 29th
of February, our roving commenta-
tor, Addison Brockenbrough, was
among the merry-makers at the an-
nual Winter Formal at the Southern
Seminary School.

The fete was held on the institu-
tion’s beautiful campus, atop a
wooded hill overlooking the com-
munity of Buena Vista. Addison
and companions arrived at the
school promptly at 8 o’clock from
an all-afternoon pre-dance cocktail
party. The company was in high
spirits.

The campus was alive with ar-
riving dates, porters, and cab
drivers—a_ scintillating scene! At
the door we were met by two
gracious doormen in white jackets
who ushered us into the main
waiting room. This spacious hall,
so beloved to those who frequent
it, was bedecked with festive dec-
orations and given a homey touch
by a giant gas log in the fireplace
at the end of the foyer. While
dates were being summoned, Ad-
dison made light conversation with
the beautiful and gracious chap-
erones who filtered among the
guests with the greatest of ease.

Not a few of the young gallants
gasped when the ladies began to
descend the staircase into the wait-
ing room! Lovely and breathtaking
in their white, red, and pink chif-
fons (so much in the vogue at pres-
ent) ‘the young ladies looked like
angels. The hall began to fill with
revelers, and soon it was OFF TO
THE DANCE!!

The ball was held in the school
gymnasium which had been decor-
ated especially for the occasion. Ad-
dison and group were thrilled with
the streamer and crepe-paper dec-
orations that bedecked both the main
dance floor and the surrounding
portico. The crowning touch was
provided by two grand canopies
suspended above the floor which
were sources of constant attention
to dancers because of their amazing
ability to seem constantly ready to
fall. Daring conversation pieces!

Dancers swirled to the music of
the well-known Freddy Lee Or-
chestra, Freddy and band, (ob-
viously primed for the occasion),
not only played for dancing, but
also delighted guests and dates
with feature jazzy numbers which
were quite good. Off to the side of
the band at the end of the dance
floor was a quaintly-lit parlor
where distinctly non-alcoholic re-
freshments were served to the
weary dancers throughout the
evening.

All agreed that the high point of
the gay evening was the beautiful
and well-planned figure. As the or-
chestra played soft music, the “belles
of the ball” and their handsome
escorts paraded along the floor. The
girls all had on full-length, white,
formals—generally of the plunging,
strapless variety. Addison and com-
panions looked on in delight. Notable
among the figure escorts were local
socialites Timothy Henry and Har-

Jimmy Sylvester (74) try in vain to block the pass for the Grads.

 

In another action shot of the Varsity-Alumni football game, Buck

just grabbed a short Alumni pass.

Barranco Tosses Three For Grads;
McLaughlin ‘Satisfied’ With Game

Three touchdown passes by
proved decisive Saturday as the

the Alumni’s A. J. Barranco,

“old men” trounced the Var-

sity, 20-0, in the annual windup game for Spring football

practice.

Barranco’s aerials connected with Buck Ogilvie, Henry
Sackett, and Stuart Yoffe, while Sackett ran for a two-pointer

 

after the second TD for the tallies.*

Although the varsity gridders
were less than impressive, General
Coach Lee MeLaughlin felt that
since he was “interested mainly in
giving everybody a chance to play
and seeing how they would hit,” the
outcome of the game does not neces-
sarily mean curtains for next year’s
football hopes.

W&L’s head mentor added that
“by and large, we were pleased
with Spring Practice and the im-
provement throughout the two-week
span.” McLaughlin pointed out that
the Alumni had virtually all of
last year’s starting offensive team
playing Saturday, and that, in ad-
dition, had such stalwarts as Jerry
Hyatt, Terry Fohs, Bob Paine, and
Charlie Gummey.

Coach Mac said that the results
of the game show “that we have our
work cut out for us, but,” he con-
tinued, “we have a number of dedi-
eated hard-working boys who will
hit,” and with coaching and work
he expects to be able to field a
“representative” team next fall.

Joe Miller and Jeff Novinger
were praised for their outstanding
defensive play, while Skip Chase
received the coaches plaudits for
offense. On the whole, the coach
said, he was also very pleased with
the offensive fullback play.
OUTLOOK FOR NEXT YEAR:

Coach McLaughlin pointed out
that every offensive position would
have to be re-filled due to the
graduation of 17 Seniors, How-
ever, the General boss felt that
W&L might have a chance for a
500 season, provided “the boys
meet the challenge and are will-

ing to work.”

Frosh Hoopsters
End 9-3 Season

By DICK DeWAUGH
Tuesday Sports Writer
With victories in four of their last
five games, the Washington and Lee
freshman basketball team finished
with a 9-3 seasonal record, one of
the best frosh team records ever
compiled at W&L according to cage
coach Joe Lyles.

Coach Lyles attributed the suc-
cess to simply “hard work and team
play.” The frosh boss pointed that
the freshman success is even more
impressive considering the loss of
two starters, Jack Fisher and How-
ard Gordy, after the first semester
due to grades.

“They realized that they had to
work and they did,” the coach con-
tinued, “and the main portion of
success comes from the team’s carry-
over of 100 per cent hustle from
practice to games.”

Lyles cited Frank Morrison, with
a 19.3 scoring average for the twelve
game season, Mike Saunders, Dave
Ogilvie, Roy Powell, and Marc
Winston for their play throughout
the season. The Baby Generals’
mentor added that Francis Jones
also did a fine job as number six
man on the squad with his heads-
up play.

“This was one of the finest fresh-
man teams I’ve ever coached,” said
Lyles, and he remarked that he was
looking forward to seeing them on
the varsity next year.

Coach Lyles Cites Catching As Problem

Baseball Outlook Bright

By TOM CARPENTER

The success of Washington and Lee’s baseball team appears to hinge
on one position, catching. Give the Generals a solid defensive catcher,
and they should win a few games this season.

The Generals lost four of last year’s starters, two unexpectedly. Third
baseman and captain Chuck Lane and shortstop Buck Rose graduated, but
the loss of outfielders Eric Sisler and Bob Taylor came as an unexpected
blow to Coach Joe Lyles’ plans for this season. Taylor supplied many a
clutch hit last year and was the Generals’ best defensive outfielder.
Sisler was the leading hitter with an average over .400. He also was the
College Athletic Conference All-Star leftfielder.

The pitching looks pretty solid with star lefthanders Chris Wigert and
Brice Gamber returning. Coach Lyles would like another righthander.
Mason McGown, the number one righthander last season, was lost early
with a bad shoulder, and Lyles is uncertain as of yet if the shoulder has
healed. Other possibilities are catcher Deug Davis and versatile Lou
Paterno. Five rookies will also be hoping for hill spots. Roy Powell, lanky
righthander, appears to be the best prospect. He has poise and is a control
pitcher. Others are Terry Herman, Jim Cooper, Pete Heumanns, and soph-
omore Scott Lavery.

The number one catcher from last year is Davis, although he can ex-
pect competition from Tom Crenshaw, and freshman Ward Briggs. Heu-
manns is another possibility. Lyles admits that he will be willing to sac-
rifice hitting for a good defensive catcher.

The infield has two assured starters, but where they will play is the
question. Lou Flanagan, a co-captain with Gamber, will be at second or

Score Tied After Five Events;
W&L Loses On Close Matches

CHASE

Tuesday Sports Writer
Traveling to Charlottesville, the wrestling Generals of
Coach Dick Miller wanted nothing more than a victory over

f the first five matches the score

stood at 8-8, but winning only one of the final three heavier
ok

weights gave the wrestlers the short
end of a 16-13 result and a final
6-5-1 seasonal record.

The match began with Butch
West having to settle for a 3-3
tie after a disputed decision for
stalling in the crucial third period.
Then Dick Musick shut out his
opposing Wahoos, 5-0, to give W&L
a 5-2 lead.

In the “match we needed to
win,” as Coach Miller said, Kem
White saw his near pin in the first
period go for naught as his com-
petition squeezed out a 7-6 win on
the one point given for riding time.

Prospects brightened, though as

_| Jamie Andrew, in the 147 pound

class, taking over for ineligible Tom
Stover, beat his opponent, 4-2, in
a close, come from behind, victory.

Winfield Wrestles Wells

In the most exciting match of
the evening, Pete Winfield tangled
with his arch foe and acting Vir-
ginia captain Alex Wells. With re-
verses dominating the first two
periods, Winfield was behind, 8-4.
However, Winfield, in fine shape,
came back with 5 points and al-
most a pin in the third period.
Unable to hold down his larger op-
ponent, Winfield fell victim to an
escape coupled with riding time
that spelled his defeat, 11-8.

With the match now tied, Gen-
eral captain Herb Smith saw his
first two period advantage vanish
in the final third period when Cary
Stewart, bother of W&L’s Warren
Stewart, used a reverse and near
pin to take a 7-4 decision.

Light scrambled country-fresh eggs,
country-fried ham, cream whipped

third, and Paterno will be at first, third, or short. John Lackey is a veteran
who can play first base, as is Howie Martin, but Martin is probably going
to pass up playing this season. Dave Kirkpatrick could work his way into
the third base or shotstop jobs. He is fast and handles his glove well.
Cooper is a third base prospect, while Mike Saunders may find his way
into one of the starting positions.

The outfield has been depleted by player losses. Besides Taylor and
Sisler it seems that Dick Brown has decided to play this season, That
leaves only three veterans, Pete Candler, Ashley Allen, and Jim Crothers.
Crothers also plays first, and Allen may not be able to help the team
because of labs, which will cause him to miss practice quite frequently.
Wigert, who led the team in RBI’s last year while playing in more than
half of the games, will probably play in the outfield against righthanded
pitchers when he is not pitching. Freshman Gene Gillespie stands a good
chance to win a spot in this undermanned position.

Coach Lyles summed up his needs which he seems to think are many,
in one sentence. He is looking for a catcher, a third baseman, a shortstop,
and two outfielders. He also wants another right handed pitcher.

Lyles also seems upset at the fact that the team must play seven games
in eight days on the Spring Trip. He hopes to have his pitching staff ready
by then.

He also commented that anyone who is interested in a tryout may still
come out. The team will work out in the gym from 4 to 6 p.m. Monday
through Friday until he feels that they are ready to go out onto the field.
As of now, there are only 25 men on the roster.
