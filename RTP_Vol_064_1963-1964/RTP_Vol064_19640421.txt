Noell, Eckes
Get Fulbrights

The Fulbright-Hays Scholarship
Committee announced this week the
names of two Washington and Lee
students as scholarship winners.
Seniors William A. Noell of Blue-
field, West Virginia and Alfred E.
Eckes of Admore, Pennsylvania
were the two students named by the
committee.

The grants are made under

 

the

provisions of the Mutual Education- |

al and Cultural Exchange Act of
1961. Candidates are selected by the

Board of Foreign Scholarships which
is appointed by the President. All
candidates that appear before the
national committee have been rec-
ommended by campus Fulbright-
Hays committees.

Noell, retiring President of the
Student Body, will do his study at
the University of Frankfort in
Frankfort, Germany. His main field
of study will be research into the
policy of co-determination. Under
this policy the workers in factories
sit in on management meetings and
help determine factory policy. Most
of Noell’s study will be with the
steel industry in Germany, where
the policy of co-determination has
been especially prevalent. He will
try to determine if the policy has
been successful, and if so, whether
it could be transplanted to other
countries.

Eckes will be doing graduate study
in eeonomics at Christ’s College,
Cambridge. He plans to work spe-
cifically with preferential trading

Sibal, Osmers Accept Invitations

 

Two Speakers Named By Sharp

Phil Sharp, chairman of the Mock
Convention, has announced that the
convention’s traditional evening ad-
dress on May 4 will be divided be-
tween two U.S. Congressmen, The
Hon. Abner Sibal (R-Conn.) and
The Hon. Frank Osmers (R-N.J.).

The pair will highlight the eve-
ning session of the convention's
opening day, following the keynote
address by Dr. Walter Judd. Os-
mers and Sibal bring the number of
congressmen who will attend the
Mock Convention to three, The Hon.
Richard Poff of Roanoke having

accepted an invitation earlier this
year.

Sharp described beth Sibal and
Osmers as moderates in their po-
litical thinking. He pointed out
that their presence at the Mock
Convention will balance a number
of political conservatives who plan
to attend. The conservatives who
will be at the convention already
include strong Goldwater backers
such as National Republican
Chairman “Buz” Lukens and Ala-
bama Republican Chairman John
Grenier.

 

 

Communist Domination By 1967
Forseen By Professor McCrossen

By HOWARD EPSTEIN

Speaking in Lee Chapel last night,
Dr. Vincent A. McCrossen, Professor
of Languages and Literature at
Boston College, warned that because
Communism was expanding at the
rate of 4.6 per cent a year, this
country would be Communist by
January 15, 1966.

However, the Professor’s store of
knowledge did not end there. He
pointed out that, although the Com-
munists may compose only a small
minority of the country, they will
prevail due to the support of other
groups that hold similar beliefs—
liberals and other paralled groups.

Communist Behind Racial Crisis

Dr. McCrossen viewed the pres-
ent racial crisis as a Communist-led
plot to create frustration and law-
lessness among the people He show-
ed how this provided little aid for
the Negroes, much propaganda for
the Communists, and is supported
by all American Communist lead-
ers.

He exposed the Civil Rights Bill
as a serious threat to the freedom
of the individual, especially in that
it places the property, job, means
of life, and other rights of the indi-
vidual in the hands of a small bu-
reaucratic group led by the Attor-
ney General.

 

Notice

Tonight at 8:00 (duPont Auditor-

ium) ReVue will present Mr. Joe
Sun Hawk, an American Indian
philosopher and  extemperaneous

poet. The elderly former head of the
American Church, an Indian relig-
ious organization of the Southwest
(famed for its use of peyote), will
speak on “Sunrise—a View from the
Indian Side.”

Sun Hawk, dressed in his tribal
garments, will appear in Lexing-
ton while en route from his home
at the Taos Pueblo in Albuquerque,
New Mexico, to New York where he
plans to attend the opening of the
World’s Fair
evening to
University.

ReVUE at New York

and lecture Thursday

Instead of employing government
force, MecCrossen proposed a meth-
od of eradicating discrimination
through a personal and religious
medium. In this way the Communists
would not be aided, the same goal
would be achieved, and the dem-
ocratic traditions of our country
would be maintained.

In closing, the speaker exhibited
how the Communists could be a
stooge for another international con-

Dr. Vincent ‘ -McCrossen

spiracy that is “using” them just
as the Communists are using other
organizations for Red purposes. Dr.
MecCrossen was unable to name such
a group but listed possible examples
of such a group—international bank-
ers or Zionists.

In the question period following
his lecture, the Professor diagramed
the American political spectrum
which was highlighted by his label-
ing Nelson Rockefeller and Henry
Cabot Lodge “Stooges” of the
Communists and Barry Goldwater
and William Buckley “Moder-
ates.” The only rightists were anar-
chists and maybe followers of Ann
Rand.

Sibal In Second Term

Representative Sibal served as
Prosecuting Attorney and Corpora-
tion Counsel for the City of Nor-
walk, Connecticut, before being
elected to the State Senate in 1957.
He became Minority Leader in the
Connecticut Senate, and was Chair-
man of the Connecticut Commission
on the Revision of Corporation Law.
He was elected to the 87th Congress
from his state’s Fourth District, and
was re-elected to the 88th Congress.
He is a member of the House Inter-
state and Foreign Commerce Com-
mittee, and is Connecticut’s repre-
sentative to the Republican Con-
gressional Campaign Committee.

Representative Osmers served in
succession as councilman and mayor
of his home city of Haworth, New
Jersey, and as a state assemblyman.
Elected to the 76th and 77th Con-
gresses, he left Congress the day
World War II was declared to en-
list as a private. He was discharged
from active duty as a major.

Mr. Osmers won a special election
to an unexpired term in the 82nd
Congress, and has since been re-
elected to the 83rd, 84th, 87th, and
88th Congresses. He represents the
Ninth District of New Jersey in the
House.

 

Concert Series

Closes Apr. 23

The Richmond Symphony Orches-
tra, with members of 'the Richmond
Woodwind Quintet as guest soloists,
will present the final concert of the
Rockbridge Concert-Theater Series
season at 8:15 p.m. Thursday, April
23. The concert will take place in
the Washington and Lee Gymnasium
instead of at VMI as previously an-
nounced.

John O’Brannon,
Thayer, French horn;
er, Clarinet:

oboe; Edwin
Robert Bark-
and Richard Manson,
basson, will be featured players in
the Sinfonie Concertante in E-flat
Major by Mozart. Other works on
the Richmond Symphony’s _ initial
Lexington appearance will be Ros-
sinni’s Overture to the Barber of
Seville and Tchaikovsky’s “Pathe-
tique” Symphony.

The Mozart Sinfonie is described
by Alfred Einstein as a work lying
somewhere between a symphony in
which four wind instruments have
prominent solo passages and a con-
certo for four solo wind instruments
with orchestra accompaniment. Mo-
zart wrote the work in Paris in 1778
and sold it to a promoter of concerts.
For some reason the scheduled per-
formance was cancelled and Mozart
did not retrieve his score. He stated
his intention of re-writing it from
memory and may have done so. The
text now being used was discovered
in the 1860’s, and there is no way
of telling whether it was the original
seore or a re-written version.

Handley: Colvin
Grab Leads

In ‘Androcles’

The Troubadour Theatre announc-
es that the cast has been selected
for the third production of the
year, Androcles and the Lion. The
play, a comedy by George Bernard
Shaw, contains a large cast of nine-
teen men and five women.

In the title role of Androcles is
Lockhardt Handley. Handley was
seen last in two low comic roles in
Dr. Faustus. As Androcles, Handley
portrays the hen-pecked, animal-
loving Christian whose meekness
awards him salvation from the jaws
of the Emperor’s lion.

Morton Plays the Lion

The Lion is played by Tim Morton
who doubles in the role of Spintho,
a debauched Christian prisoner
whose only hope for salvation is to
suffer martyrdom in the arena.

As ‘the Lion, Morton is both fe-
rocious and friendly, depending upon
his appetite. Morton portrayed Faus-
tus in the Trowbs’ last production.

Representing pomp and severity of
Roman justice is the Captain, played
by Steve Colvin who also appeared
in Faustus. Colvin plays the part of
a befuddled officer of the Emperor
who struggles, despite obvious dif-
ferences in beliefs, to save another
Patrician, a female Christian pris-
oner, Lavinia.

Reading To Portray Caesar

In the role of the erratic and
quixotic Caesar is Gay Reading. As
Emperor, Reading has to mingle his
affairs of state with a personal con-
frontation with his own lion who
is all too eager to devour him. Con-
trasted to the Emperor is Ferrovius,
played by Joe Volpe. Volpe is seen
as a Christian prisoner who is a bit
of a brute aside from being force-
fully persuasive when it comes to
converting the likes of Lentulus,
played by Lew Davis.

Filling important women’s roles
are two newcomers to the Troub-
abour stage, Mrs. Jane Rushing
and Mrs. Mary Ann Gilda. Mrs.
Rushing, wife of Robert Rushing,
Visiting Associate Professor of Law,
characterizes Megaera, Andro-
cles’ domineering non-Christian
wife. Mrs. Gilda, wife of John Gilda,
a law senior, portrays Lavinia, a
Christian martyr with the wit of
Shaw and the breeding of a Patri-
cian.

Featured Comic Roles

Other featured comic roles be-
long to Mare Rehr, the boisterous
and incredulous Centurion, and to
Charlie Bright, the Emperor’s pom-
pous Editor. Both are forced to deal
with the jubilant Christians who
refuse to act like martyrs. Stark
Sydnor plays two roles: The Imper-
ial Ox-cart Driver and the brawny
Gladiator, Secutor, who tangles with
Retiarius, another gladiator played
by Lexington High School senior
Bill Gaines. Mike Nation plays Me-
tellus, another of the Emperer’s fav-
orites.

Also featured in _ this
hearted farce is Jake Duvall,
son of Dr. Severn Duvall, head of
the English Department. At 11%,
Jake is clearly the youngest in this
cast of 24, yet he maintains a
speaking part as Call Boy for the
events in the arena.

One Editorship Undecided

The Publications Board was un-
able to decide on a second candidate
for the editorship of The Ring-tum
Phi. A meeting will be called in
the near future by the board pres-
ident Syd Butler to attempt to reach
a satisfactory conclusion.

Smith has worked with The Ring-
tum Phi since his freshman year,
serving progressively as Associate
Editor, News Editor, and Managing
Editor. He has worked this year
as Publicity Director for the Mock
Convention, and served as the Presi-
dent of this year’s Spring Dances.

In addition to maintaining Dean’s
List and Honor Roll grades, Simth
is a Dorm Counselor, a member of
ODK, and a member of Tau Kappa
Alpha, honorary debate fraternity.

Smith’s Editorial Plan

Smith says his program next yeai
will be to present an interpretation
of news events through an objective
editorial policy.

Carrell has worked on the busi-
ness side of the newspaper since his
freshman year, serving this past year
as Subscription Manager. He has
been elected president of the Liber-
ty Hall Society this spring.

Baur, besides writing a humor
column this year for the Friday
Edition, serves on the Cold Check
Committee and plays Varsity Tennis.
He has worked for the Troubadour
Theatre, is an officer in his frater-

Governor William W. Scranton of Pennsylvania receives
the full endorsement of the Tuesday Edition of the Ring-tum
Phi as the most qualified man for the 1964 Republican Nomi-
tion. While Scranton has spent less time in public office than
any other potential nominee, he has done more, relatively
speaking, than any of them to prove his fitness for the office of

 

Tuesday

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

Edition

 

President of the United States. Our decision to support Gover-
nor Scranton is based on our conviction that he is the best man
to unite the GOP in the 1964 campaign, and that his capability
has been proved by his record as Governor.

Scranton’s Accomplishments in Pennsylvania

In only two years as Governor, Scranton has put new life
into a state which was in sorry shape economically when he
took office. The record:

% When Scranton took office in 1962, Pennsylvania un-
employment was 9.4 per cent—one of the highest in the na-
tion. At the end of 1963, it was down to 6.7 percent, and
56,000 people had been taken off relief.

* During 1963, 350 new industries moved into Pennsyl-
vania, and 350 more announced expansion plans. Bank de-
posits increased by two billion dollars.

% Since 1962, 2,500 new classrooms have been comple-
ted and a record $70 billion has been committed for public and
private colleges. There has been a substantial, across-the-board
hike in teachers’ salaries.

% Ninety per cent of Scranton’s program has been passed
through a legislature which has a tiny Republican majority.

% Scranton has eliminated more than 2,500 unnecessary
jobs in Pennsylvania’s spoils system.

We could go on—his record as Governor is unblemished,
and promises to stay that way. He has followed through on
every promise he made in his campaign for governor.

Scranton Behind States’ Rights

Scranton believes government must be kept close to the
people, and is a firm advocate of letting state governments
sponsor programs for housing, urban redevelopment, educa-
tion, and employment. He feels that the state governments—
if they will take the responsibility—can do a much better job
in these fields than the national government. To help them
do their job, he suggests that the federal government turn
over $16 billion in excise taxes to the states.

Views on Foreign Affairs

Scranton believes in brinkmanship. He advocates a strong
stand against the Communists, even where there is obvious
danger involved. The only thing the Communists understand
is strength, in Scranton’s view, and he believes the United
States has enough strength to force Russia to back down as
they have in Greece, Lebanon, Cuba, Korea, Quemoy and
Matsu.

Cuba must be acted upon—there are various types of
blockades, depending on what intelligence reports show. The
United States cannot afford to sit on its hands while Cuba con-
tinues to be a center for Communist subversion in Latin

America.

liberalizing the operating rules of the Kerr-Mills Act. Scran-
ton is outspoken in his support of civil rights. He approves
the objectives of every title of the civil rights bill now before
Congress.

Record as Campaigner

One of the most impressive things about Scranton is his
campaign personality—it is sincere, cool under pressure, and
vigorous. Were Scranton to run against Johnson for the presi-
dency, the contest between the two men would be marked—
all in favor of Scranton. He “has been tugged reluctantly into
every public job he has ever held,” yet once he has been
assured of party support, he has won by impressive majorities.

In 1960, he ran for Congress from Pennsylvania’s 10th
District. There were 34,000 more registered Democrats than
registered Republicans in that district when Scranton started
his campaign. In the year that Kennedy swept Pennsylvania,
and its 10th District by 15,000 votes, Scranton won by
17,000 votes. In 1962, he won his bid for the governorship
by 486,000 votes.

Scranton enjoys street-corner politicking. His mind is quick
and analytical. Before he ran for Congress in 1960, he worked
in the State Department under John Foster Dulles and Chris-
tian Herter. Herter’s appraisal: “I have never seen anyone
grasp with greater rapidity not only the factual details but the
implications in the many knotty problems which come to this
office.”

While a Congressman, Scranton ignored the tradition that
a freshman Congressman should be seen and not heard. He
offered major amendments to Kennedy’s 1961 housing bill and
his 1962 public-works bills. Both his amendments were adopt-
ed. In each case, his amendments reduced the amount of
money a local community would have to pay as a share of
federal projects.

Personal History

Scranton went to Hotchkiss for prep school, Yale for his
B.A., majoring in history there. During World War II, he
served as an Air Transport Command pilot. In 1946, he re-
ceived a law degree from Yale. He is now 47 years old,
and is worth about eight million dollars because of inheritances
from his parents. He is a devoted family man, who believes that
he should refuse to run for any public office unless he has his
political party completely behind him. That is why he insists
on having a genuine draft from the Republican convention
before he will accept the nomination.

A political realist, Scranton knows that the 1964 presi-
dential race will be impossible to win unless the candidate is
promised the full support of every branch of his party. He
insisted upon it before he ran for governor in Pennsylvania,
and all 67 of the usually squabbling county chairmen immedi-
ately gave him their support.

balanced budget to Pennsylvania at the beginning of this year
with a 25-million-dollar operating surplus in the legislature.
He does not favor Medicare, because “it covers too many peo-
ple who don’t need help and fails to cover many who do.”

MacArthur’
That Will Not Be Forgotten

By GARETH S. ADEN
There is something about the death
of a great soldier that plays on the
imagination. To be sure there was
something about
y the slow proces-
i sion that made its
way through the
wet streets of our
F nation’s capital a
littlemore than a
week ago that
stirred the mem-
ories of millions
of Americans. Mo-
mentarily they
forgot Bobby Bak-
er, nomination
campaigns, and all else. MacArthur
was dead.

It has been said that it is most
difficult for college students of to-
day to sense the significance of
MacArthur’s life or the loss of his
death. To a great extent this must
be true. It would take someone, an
American, who could recall the
fall of Corregidor or the ensuing
dark days in the Pacific to truly
appreciate the strength and con-
fidence associated with the name
“MacArthur.” Only to those who
were vitally concerned at the time
can the words, “I will return”
truly have meaning. We who come
after can only seek to know the
life and the man to whom our
country pays so great tribute.

 

Above all else General Douglas
MacArthur was a soldier. It is as a
soldier that he would want to be
remembered. His whole life reflects
the military code which he esteemed
above all other codes. And he was
no ordinary soldier as he proved
time and again over the course of
two world wars. As a leader he was
both bold and responsible at the

 

- The Legend

same time. He had learned the ab-
solute value of victory and had the

technical and strategical knowledge

to bring off superior campaigns.

His talents were especially adaptable | |
to the island fighting of the South] :

Pacific, where his “leap-frog” strat-
egy proved vital to the Allies.

Among MacArthur's various tal-
ents, was his ability for adminis-
tration. He made the Allied occu-
pation of Japan a success and
actually agreeable to the people of
that country. Wherever he worked
as a leader, he ingratiated himself
with the people there, and built
himself a legend at home .To the
people of the occupation abroad,
he was an able and personable
leader; to Americans at home, he
was the one general in the Pa-
cifie who could win.

MacArthur will be remembered as
a man of great conviction. He be-
came an image of strength and con-
fidence. Although many Americans,
including the President, disagreed
with his views on policy and ex-

pedience; none of them could ques- |

tion the integrity of his opinion or | ; ;
erey P ' audience’s

make him change his mind. Be-
cause of his views, he was relieved
of his command, but the hysterical
welcome he received upon returning
to the United States spoke clearly
enough for the peoples’ admiration

As has been the case with so many
great military men, MacArthur had a
gift for rhetoric. In a sentence he
could catch the tragedy or the vic-
tory of the most complicated situa-
tion. His words were the type that
appealed to men’s imaginations. The
following lines concern the Ameri-
can soldiers who died in World War
I, and are among his most famous:

“I do not know the dignity of

  

I have seen “Dr. Strangelove: Or
How I Learned To Stop Worrying
and Love the Bomb” five times;
I have reacted differently each time;
and I believe I can say it is the best
American movie I have ever seen.
I almost hesitate to say so, be-
cause of my varied reactions, but
I have attempted to compare it
with the good films that have come
before, and that is my conclusion.
The film is not without flaws. Some
of the dialogue should have been
omitted (for example, when Sterling
Hayden closes one scene with “The
redcoats are coming.”); some lines
are delivered poorly; and sometimes
the director loses control of his ac-
tors. Yet if any movie may be called
great, this one may.

Controlled Audience Response

I believe Stanley Kubrick’s great-
est talent is his ability to control the
emotional responses, to
accentuate the comedy and the ser-
iousness in order to make his point
as telling as possible. Before review-
ing the film in detail, I would like
to say something about the titles,
While the credits are given at the
beginning, we are treated to the
sight of two airplanes engaged in
the sex act. You have to laugh be-
cause it is funny; but it is also the
most obscene sequence I have seen
in a film. Without a point it would
be tasteless. Yet it has an important
one; the mere fact that we ean
recognize it as two magnificent and
very modern machines making love.
Has it come to that? Indeed it has,

 

(Continued on page 4)

and indeed this is the strangest love

  
  
 
 

 

imaginable. Kubrick questions, with
the answer implied, the social and
moral “progress” of man.

Mixture of Comedy

The film is divided into eighteen
sequences. The first is at Burpelson
Air Force Base, where, on his own
authority, General Jack D. Ripper
orders an attack on Russia. The
scene is amusing because of the
slightly exaggerated character of
Ripper, played with admirable re-
straint by Sterling Hayden. But it
is also deeply serious; the signifi-
cance of the attack and the recog-
nition of Ripper as a psychotic make
one hesitate to laugh.

The second is at the airplane com-
manded by Major King Kong. This
scene is funnier than the first be-
cause of its dialogue and because
of Kong’s personality and character.
Kubrick makes fun of the serious-
ness of the coming attack.

The third sequence is the bedroom
of General Buck Turgidson, Chief
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This
scene is hilarious all the way
through, both because of the situa-
tion and because of Turgidson’s
character, played by George C. Scott.
Turgidson is no psychotic; he is
merely a simple-minded egoist, so
concerned with his role in life, that
it never occurs to him that it is a
role. You are expected to laugh at
him from beginning to end.

Thus Kubrick seems to have built
slowly and begun a riotous comedy;
the seriousness has slipped away.
But it doesn’t. Kubrick switches us
back to Ripper. He again handles

sequence, but the point I am making
is well illustrated in these first four.
Kubrick goes on in later scences to
present the incredible absurdity of
the situation and the characters. At
these scenes we must laugh. In
other scenes, however, he maintains
a rigorous development of suspense,
as if no comedy had come before
it. Let me examine one of these
carefully in order to point out just
how Kubrick is able to control us.

When Major Kong’s plane has
entered Russian territory, a missile
is fired at it. Kubrick builds the
suspense in this way—by switching
from a shot of the radar machine
showing how far away the missile
is, to the pilot, outside to a shot of
the plane trying to evade the missile,
back to the radar machine, back to
the pilot, and so on until the missile
explodes. All this time we sit, afraid
for the plane and for our boys,
wondering if they will escape the
missile. Finally when they do, we
are relieved. And then it suddenly
occurs to us that because our plane
and our boys have escaped destruc-
tion, for a while the world is going
to be destroyed. We have been put
in a position where we have cheered
for the worng side. I can think of
no better example of Kubrick’s
genius.

Immaturity
Charged In
Campaign

By ROD COCKSHUTT

The Student Body elections are
over. Whether the candidates who
_ won are or will
be the “best men”
is something we
won't really know
until next year
_ at this time. Cer-
tainly the officers-
elect deserve, and
will need, the sup-
port and cooper-
» ation of the entire
student body at
Cockshutt Washington and
Lee if the princi-
ple of student government is ever

to work effectively here.

But let us turn our attention to
the campaign just passed. It was,
it seems to me, on both sides, the
most immature, the most super-
ficial, and certainly the dullest
campaign which has taken place
on this campus in the four years
I've been here.

That a fraternity should bolt a
party because one of its men is
not nominated, or because the par-
ty’s candidates do not appeal to cer-
tain elements in a particular house,
smacks of immaturity. Politics is no
place for people who pick up their
marbles and go home, or go else-
where when the game isn’t played
their way. This is where the cam-
pus politics “pros” of last year show-
ed this year how “professional” they
really are.

And where were the issues of the
campaign? The platforms that both
parties claimed to stand on were
filled with vagaries, generalities, and
trivialities that seemed aimed more

Lacrosse Team Smashes Villanova, 21-1

W&L Trackaten

Trackmen Advance Record
In Roanoke College Victory

By LARRY CRAIG
Tuesday Sports Writer

The W

/ashington and Lee trackmen advanced their season’s

record to 3-1 with their victory Saturday over a good Roanoke

College team, 83-57.

The Generals were led by triple-winner Chris Kell who
won the 100, 220 and anchored the winning 440-yard relay

team. Brother Robin Kell also
jump,
step and jump, and finishing third
in the broad jump.

A pleasant surprise came when
sophomore Rick Myttinen threw
the javelin 182 feet, three inches.
This was far his best effort and the
best for W&L in the last few years
although the toss got him only a
second place.

Other results were John Graham
who placed first in the pole vault
with an 11 foot, 6 inch jump; Gay
Gasque who won the shot and
placed second in the discus while
Head and Skip Essex settled for
second place in the two mile and
and 440-yard races respectively.

This afternoon the thinclads op-
pose Lynchburg and it seems the
coaches feel they should win. Three
more meets remain with ithe state
and CAC meets following the sea-
son.

Tennis Team Shuts Out
Lynchburg College, 9-0
Jones, Short Excel

By Dick DeWAUGH
Tuesday Sports Writer
With two of the General tennis

stars out of action—Jim DeYoung
and John Baker—the W&L netters
still encountered little trouble with
Lynchburg as they shut out the
Hornets, 9-0, Friday on the Wash-
ington and Lee courts.

Randy Jones, playing in the num-
ber one position easily downed his
opponent, 6-1, 6-2, while Jim Mell
and Lindsey Short both won with-
out trouble, 6-1, 6-1. Forrest Dickin-
son, Howard Busse, and Fred Webb
all trounced their opponents easily to
complete the singles sweep .

Doubles Sweep

In the doubles matches, the first
team of Jones and Short won 6-3,
6-1, and the other two matches
went just as easily as Dickinson
and Mell scored 6-1, 6-2, and the
Busse-Webb team completed the
sweep by winuning 6-1, 6-3.

Today the netters risk their fine
8-2 record against the Spiders of the
University of Richmond. The match-
es, to be played on the W&L courts,
began at 3:15.

By SKIP CHASE
Tuesday Sports Writer

The Generals’ nine of coach Joe
Lyles were easy victims of the
R.P.I. Rams, and handed the visitors
a 13-4 decision through a gift of
nine errors.

The Generals’ entire staff except-
ing Chris Wigert was used in a
vain attempt ‘to put out the fire, but
giving the Rams an average of four
outs per inning sapped the effort
and moral of W&L hurlers.

It was an offensive game with
each collecting ten hits, but the
Generals were given only two errors
which made the difference in score.
A pair of four-run innings broke
the game open for the Rams while
W&L’s hits and runs were well
scattered.

Big hitters for W&L continued to
be shortstop Dave Kirkpatrick and
outfielder Ashley Allen who collect-
ed three and two hits respectively.
Tom Crenshaw’s play at his new
outfield position was also cited and
his strong arm combined with Allen’s
game make the Generals a more de-
fensively potent outfield.

Ft. Bragg Today

The W&L nine is now 1-5-1 for
intercollegiate play. They played
the Ft. Brogg Dragons today in a
non-seasonal game in hopes of
registering a win against their
Spring Vacation rivals who handed
them three defeats at that time. Co-
captain Brice Gamber was given the
nod as starting pitcher. Thursday
the Generals travel to Bridgewater
also hoping to avenge an earlier loss.
RPI 4002041 2 0—13 10 2
W&L 110101000—4109

The remaining schedule for the
baseball team consists of away games
with Bridgewater (April 23) and
Randolph-Macon (April 29) and
home contests with tthe Monarchs
of Old Dominion (May 2) and
Lynchburg College (May 6). After
these regular season games, the
Generals will travel to Danville and
participate in the second CAC spring

Wahoos Edge W&L Linksters;
Go On To Beat Old Dominion

By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor
VIRGINIA
In a very close match, Washing-
ton and Lee’s golf team lost two
individual contests one-up and al-
lowed the University of Virginia to
edge the General linksters, 4'2-

2%.

Roger Sennott of W&L was lead-
ing his match with the Wahoo’s
Dell Lanceford putting on the last
green, but the Cavalier sank a
thirty-foot putt to half the match
thus depriving the Generals of at
least a tie in the overall contest.

Bill Wiley was very impressive
as he defeated Bob Verity of UVa.,
2-1. Verity, incidentally, is a past
winner of the state intercollegiate
title. Washington and Lee’s only
other winner, besides Sennot’s tie,
was Mike Gocke who defeated Henry
Warren, two and one.

Bob Duckwall and Steve Henry
both lost fairly close matches to
their Cavalier opponents, while Ed
Crosland and Dick Drew were both
defeated one-up. Virginia's Mike

OLD DOMINION

With only two halved individual
matches to mar W&L’s performance,
the General linksters easily trounc-

upping their seasonal record to 3-1,
coach “Cy” Twombly’s boys all shot

Lead W&L To Third Win

BY TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

The Generals’ lacrosse team appears to be making a habit

of routing all opponents. Satt

irday the unlucky victim was

Villanova as they suffered a 21-lsetback at the hands of the

Generals.

The Generals, who now ar
ord will face the tough challenge*
of the Tar Heels from Chapel Hill
here this Saturday. North Carolina
is winless in two starts, but the
losses were to Virginia and Wash-
ington U., two of the better teams
in the country.

Coach Bob McHenry feels that
the Carolina club has one of the
outstanding goalies in the nation in
Stanley. Last year in a game with
W&L he made 29 saves in a losing
effort. The Tar Heels are also blessed
with two good attackmen and most
starters. Assistant Coach Dana Swan

Mixed Emotions of Audience

A word about the last scene. In
this seene we see what may be des-
cribed as a ballet of bombs, with a
sad song “We'll meet Again,” being
sung in the background. I have yet
to meet two people whom it affected
in just the same way. One laughed
loudly, one laughed but felt he
shouldn’t, one cried, one was dumb-
struck and couldn’t explain, even to
himself, how he felt, one felt the
full impact of the horror of the
nightmarish events he had just
watched. And, finally, one watched
the bombs and thought they were
beautiful, listened to the song and
thought it was pretty. He came, in
his own way, to love the bomb.

Great Artistic Success

This movie is much more than an
anti-war film. It is a cynical, critical
comment on man and the world he
has created. By exaggerating his
characters, by exaggerating the sit-
uation, Kubrick has made us laugh,
at a world that is, primarily, the
one in which we live. He has shown

glory of their death. They died un-
questioning, uncomplaining, with
faith in their hearts, and on their
lips hope that we would go on to
victory. Always for them—Duty—
Honor—Country . ..”

 

Perhaps only Winston Churchill
did more with words to inspire the
war-torn people of the last genera-
tion.

Finally, MacArthur will be re-
membered as a man of ideals. For a
successful soldier this idealism
may seem odd in a number of ways;
yet to him words such as “Duty,”
“Honor,” “Country” came naturally
and sincerely. His ideals were those
of a soldier and a patriot. These
ideals made him the soldier he was
and they created around him the
legend and popularity that still ex-
ists. He was able to couple these
ideals with the realism it takes to
wage successful war, and the out-
come was a great general and a liv-
ing legend. Now he is dead, but in
America, in Tokyo, in the Solo-
mons—MacArthur will be remem-
bered.

Rusk, Shannon, And Bishop
Speakers At ODK Meeting

(Continued from page 1)

Before being appointed to his
cabinet post in 1961 by the late
President John F. Kennedy, Secre-
tary Rusk served as president of
the Rockefeller Foundation for nine
years. Previously he was professor
of political science and government
and Dean of the Faculty at Mills
College and held positions in the
War Department and Department of
State. He served as an infantry of-
ficer in Burma during World War
I.

He was president of the Davidson
College Circle of Omicron Delta
Kappa during his senior year be-
sides being elected to Phi Beta

 

Kappa and named a Rhodes Scholar.
Shannon a W&L Alumnus

After receiving his A.B. degree
summa cum laude from Washington
and Lee in 1939, Dr. Shannon
studied at Duke University, receiv-
ing an M.A. in 1941. After service
in the Navy during World War II, he
attended Oxford University as a
Rhodes Scholar and won his Ph.D.
degree.

He taught at Harvard and the
University of Virginia of which he
was named president in 1959. His
special field of study is 19th Cen-

 

tury English literature with empha-
sis on Alfred Lord Tennyson. Dr.
Shannon is the only American who
is an honorary vice president of
the Tennyson Society.

Barry Bishop is only 32 years old,
but has already had an outstanding
career as explorer, geographer,
writer and photographer. He partic-
ipated in the first ascent on the
western buttress of Mt. McKinley
in 1951; was in the Himalayan Ex-
pedition led by Sir Edmund Hillary
in 1960-61 and one of a party of
four to reach the previously un-
sealed 22,949-foot summit of Mt.
Ama Dablam; and as a representa-
tive of the National Geographic So-
ciety, was one of five people to
reach the 29,028-foot summit of Mt.

at placating any or all elements in

hustle is the fact they they re-
covered more ground balls than did
the Cavaliers.

Never a Contest

The Villanova game was never a
contest in that the Generals scored
six goals in the first period and five
each in the three remaining quar-
ters. The Wildcats got their one
seore late in the second frame.

John McDaniel paced the winners’
attack with four goals and four as-
sists, while Carroll Klingelhofer had
two goals and four assists. Mike
Michaels and Randy Wootton had
three goals each, while Bob Hankey
and freshman Duncan LaMonte
notched two each. Single goals were
scored by Bobby Ostroff, Bob Frost,
Pat Robertson, Jay Bowersox, and
Syd Butler.

Defense Good

The defense was again superb, al-
though it wasn’t tested by the Wild-
cats. Pete Noonan made nine saves
and John Eddy Moore made two.
Werhun stopped nineteen shots for
the losers. The Generals fired 69
shots at him.

McHenry was very satisfied with

his club’s showing. “The opposition
didn’t lower our calibre of play.
We moved the ball well and got
good shots,” commented McHenry
with a pleased tone of voice.
t was a team effort as illustrated
by the 16 assists. Generally there is
one assist for every two goals. This
statistic shows that the passing was
good. The winners also did another
good job in controlling the ground
balls with a 79-21 advantage.

Wing-tip styles continue to be popular,
both in cordovan and black, And take a
look at the new man-made materials for
shoes. These practical poromerics have
extra lightness and ease-of-care—in most
cases they look freshly polished with the
flick of a handkerchief. Not that new
chest pocket handkerchief, though!

Around final time next month, we'll be checking in with the Final
Word on sportswear. See you then!

SPRING IS HERE, and it’s time for a tonic—for your wardrobe,
if not for you! Here are some pepper-uppers for you to consider.

HARMONIC TONES TELL THE STORY

in Spring suits, These are new, close-
harmony combinations of multicolored
threads, interwoven in smooth-finish
sharkskins, birdseye and herringbone pat-
terns for an intermediate color effect.

WEAR THE MUTED BLUES—insteaa of

singing ’em this Spring. The new Muted
Blues are a low-keyed blend of several
shades of blue—just one part in the
quartet of Harmonic Tones. The theme of
Chromatic Browns is implied, rather than
boldly sounded, with brown tones subtly
mixed with gray, green or blue casts.
Look for them in suits of worsted flannel
