Cleanth Brooks |
Named Speaker |

Distinguished literary _ critic,
Cleanth Brooks, will be the speaker
at the Phi Beta Kappa convocation
on April 13 at noon. His topic will
be “American Innocence as Viewed
by Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald,
and William Faulkner.

The convocation, to be held in
Lee Chapel at noon on Monday, the
13th, honors the seventeen men who
were elected this month to Phi Beta
Kappa.

The name of Cleanth Brooks is
well known to Washington and Lee
students, for he is, with Robert
Penn Warren, the editor of Under-
standing Poetry, the notable text-
book that has been used for many
years in freshman English.

Brooks has been professor of Eng-
lish literature at Yale University
since 1947. For fifteen years before
that he was professor at Louisiana
State University; he has also held
visiting professorships at the uni-
versities of Texas and Southern Cal-
ifornia.

A graduate of Vanderbilt, with a
graduate degree from Tulane, he
won a Rhodes Scholarship and spent
four years in Exeter College, Ox-
ford, where he took honors and
won a B.Litt. degree. He has been
a Guggenheim Fellow, and is now
honorary consultant for the Library
of Congress.

Professor Brooks is the author of
several estimable books, among them
Modern Poetry and the Tradition,
The Well Wrought Urn, and Mod-
ern Rhetoric. With Robert Penn
he was editor of the distinguished
Southern Review, and he has contri-
buted to many literary magazines.

The convocation on April 13 at
noon, open to the public, is not
only the high point of the Phi Beta
Kappa day, but also commemorates
the generosity of the Society of the
Cincinnati to this university.

Because of its esteem for George
Washington, the Cincinnati group

 

Grant Program
Brings 20 Here

This weekend the University is
playing host to some twenty semi-
finalists for the George F. Baker
and Robert E. Lee scholarships.

The candidates began arriving yes-
terday and planned activities started
this morning. They include confer-
ences with the Scholarship Com-
mittee, tours over the campus, and
visits to classes.

All the visitors are considered
guests of W&L, and meals and
transportation are being paid for by
the University. The candidates
are boarding at the Robert E. Lee
Hotel.

Saturday morning those applying
for the Baker Scholarships will be
interviewed by the Board of Trus-
tees Selection Committee: Mr. John
Hendon, Birmingham, Ala.;_ Dr.
John Thomas, Union Theological
Seminary; Dr. Huston St. Clair,
Tazewell, Va.

The George F. Baker Trust of
New York provides a fund for some
500 college freshmen scholarships of
varying amounts. At W&L, stipends
exists up to $1800.

There are “no limitations on the
field of study for candidates, but
it is hoped that some of the recipi-
ents may plan eventual business ca-
reers.” Emphasis is placed on lead-
ership and ability.

Five Robert E. Lee scholarships
are given, stipends range from
$1,000 to $1,800 and are open to
residents of Georgia, Kentucky,
North and South Carolina, Tennes-
see, and Virginia. “Preference is
given to students considering fields
such as teaching, public affairs,
journalism, and law.”

Seven of the prospective scholar-
ship holders are from Virginia, and
four from North Carolina.

Three men are residents of Flori-
da, two of South Carolina, an one
each of Alabama, Kentucky, and
Delaware.

 

gave a generous endowment fund to

the institution that had _ recently
changed its name to Washington
College, after the First President

made a gift to it. Washington’s gift,
made in 1796, was in the form of
100 shares of valuable canal stock.

There will be an initiation of new
members of Phi Beta Kappa in the
evening following the convocation.
Mr. Brooks will be present at the
initiation, and will speak informally
at the banquet that follows in Evans
Dining Hall.

The convocation in Lee Chapel
will be voluntary for the student
body, although there will be short
classes in order that the students
who wish to attend will be able to do
so.

Debaters Draw
At Tournament

Ed Fitzgerald and John McMurry
had a record of 8 wins and 8 losses
in a debate tournament at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania last week-
end, March 13 and 14.

The tourney matched the best 28
teams in 6 states against each other
in a power-match schedule of 8
rounds of debate. All the teams de-
bated both the affirmative and the
negative sides of the question.

The Pennsylvania tournament up-
held MeMurry’s exceptional record
of never having had a losing record
in any meet, as a Washington and
Lee debater. The pair of sophomores
were facing juniors and_ seniors
who for the most part have debated
together for long periods of time.

It was the 15th tournament for
the team this year, a record num-
ber for W&L debate. Three meets
remain this spring, West Virginia,
Randolph-Macon, and NYU.

4-2 At Georgetown

Week before last (March 6 and 7)
Fitzgerald and McMurry earned
a four and two record at George-
town, another major tournament
for eastern debating.

William W. Chaffin, director of
forensics at Washington and Lee,
commented that so far this year he
has used 41 men in intercollegiate
debates, and 40 more in practice
debates on campus. This, he said, is
a record participation for the years
since he took over the debate pro-
gram.

Dr. Cleanth Brooks Will Deliver Convocation Address

 

Concerts Scheduled

The W&L Glee Club will present
two concerts next week with the
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College
Choir. The first will be held at
Smith Hall, Randolph-Macon, on
Sunday, and the second at the Lex-
ington Presbyterian Church, Tuesday
night, at eight o’clock.

The main work in both of these
concerts will be Bach’s Cantata
Number 4, “Christ Lay in Death’s
Dark Prison” also known as his
Easter Cantata. It is a difficult work,
and the Glee Club has been re-
quired to have extra rehearsals dur-
ing the past week.

The Sunday night concert, how-
ever, will also feature the Glee
Club’s regular religious songs; “With
a Voice of Singing,’ and “Alleluia
Amen,” some songs by the Ran-
dolph-Macon Choir, and “O Clap
Your Hands” by the two combined.

Lexington High Performance

For a change of pace from all the
religious music, the Glee Club put
on a concert of popular music for
Lexington High School Wednesday
afternoon. (Part of its Cultural Pro-

 

gram). This concert, held in the

 

LHS Gymnasium (which has acous-

tics comparable with Radio City
music Hall—rather unfavorably),
was a fair success, and the teen-aged
music critics in the audience re-
ceived the conecrt very favorably.

Dr. Stewart’s Work Played

A composition by Professor Rob-
ert Stewart, Glee Club director, will
be played Monday in a concert of
contemporary music at Lee Chapel.
The concert will begin at 8 p.m.

The W&L Concert Guild is spon-
soring the event, featuring three
artists and a tape recorder—which
involves the first performance of
electronic music in Lexington.

Charles Wuorinen will play Dr.
Stewart's “Five Minatures for Pi-
ano,” and his own work, “Variations
for Flute.” Joseph Marx, and Harvey
Sollberger,flute, will join Wuorinen
in the varied program of flute so-
natas, an oboe sonata, and a trio
and piano music. The music of Chou
Wen-Chung, Davidowsky, Sollber-
ger, and Wolpe will be featured in
addition to that of Wuorinen and
Stewart.

The group for Contemporary Mu-
sic, which sponsors Sollberger and

EC, Publications Board Meet Together,
Discuss ‘Collegian’; No Action Taken

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Tuesday night the Executive Com-
mittee of the Student Body and the
W&L Publications Board met in joint
sessions to discuss Dean Atwood’s
proposal to take school subsidy away
from the Southern Collegian. No
official action was taken at this
meeting, but a straw poll taken of
the Publications Board revealed
that none of the members of this
body support Dean Atwood’s pro-
posal.

In the debate, Dick McEnally and
Tain Tompkins, respectively busi-
ness manager and editor of the
Southern Collegian, contributed the
most to the defence of the magazine.
Dean Atwood’s side was supported
by Randy Wootton, a Phi Delt sen-
ior who is not a member of the
Publications Board but was invited
to the meeting as a guest. It was
Wootton who presented the Publi-
cations Board with a list of sug-
gestions backing Dean Atwood.

Objections Rebutted

At the meeting, Dick McEnally
reviewed and replied to the objec-
tions to the Southern Collegian.
In answer to a criticism that the
Collegian is not educational, Mc-
Enally pointed out that despite the

uable training to the many writers,
cartoonists, and photographers on
the staff, the Collegian was never in-
tended to be educational. The Col-
legian was meant to be, and is, a
historical record and an outlet of
student opinion.

McEnally dealt with the criticism
that the Collegian’s “grossness” re-
flects adversely on Washington and
Lee by stating that the students are
getting what they want—“If we have
a gross magazine, we have a gross
student body.” Besides, claimed Mc-

 

Ennally, if the Collegian were cut!
off it would still reflect on W&L.

McEnally also pointed out that}
the Southern Collegian cannot be
accused of costing the school too
much because the funds that sup-
port it eome from the students,
are administered by students, and go
toward student institutions. In ad-
dition, only 30 per cent of the bud-
get of the Collegian comes from the
student activities fee.

Wootton Makes Objections
Randy Wootton reiterated his feel-
ing that the Collegian can and
should be improved by any means
possible. He feels that cutting the
Collegian off from school support
would force the quality of content

 

fact that the magazine provides val-

 

up without posing a serious threat

to the magazine’s existence. Wootton
also suggested that the magazine
be more creative and draw _ less
material from other campus pub-
lications.

Tain Tompkins denied that the
Collegian is objectionable to many
people. He further cited the ex-
amples of Shenandoah and Ariel,
two “creative” independent student
publications which are in debt.

Several other comments were
made at the meeting. Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi Editor Roger Paine com-
mented that during his editorship

lof the Southern Collegian, he re-

ceived only one complaining letter
and that 75 per cent of the present
subscribers are girls.

In conclusion, EC President Bill
Noell declared that the EC has no
power to abolish the Southern Col-
legian because the magazine is es-
tablished by the student body con-
stitution. Only a constitutional
amendment can change the Col-
legian, said Noell, and such an
amendment would have to receive a
majority of student votes for rati-

fication even if the EC supported
the amendment. Were the EC to

deny its support to an amendment,
a two-thirds vote would be neces-

sary to pass it,

bh Kilpatrick
Makes Talk On
Property Rights

By SYDNEY LEWIS

Richmond News Leader editor,
James Jackson Kilpatrick spoke be-
fore a Lee Chapel audience Tuesday
night on the topic “1984,” which was
concerned with the future of the
United States.

' The fact that government has been
|encroaching upon human rights and
property rights dismayed Mr. Kil-
patrick. By building up a historical
argument starting before the time
of Aristotle and continuing through
the formation of our Constitution,
he demonstrated that property has
always been a primary concern of
man and that embodied in our Con-
situation are clauses which should
protect us from infringement upon
these rights.

Coercive Government

Mr. Kilpatrick continued by stat-
ing that these rights have been
reduced by a coercive government.
He cited such instances as urban
renewal projects of the government
and the new Civil Rights Bill. “The
government only has the power to
claim property for public use, not
for public benefit,” Mr. Kilpatrick
stated. He claimed that the govern-
ment, unconstitutionally, had ex-
tended its right to claim land for
public benefit and was applying this
power extensively.

The Richmond editor was not un-
aware that times are changing. He
said we are in the midst of a giant
population growth, that by 2000 A.D.
we will be living in a completely
different world: a world where each
human is assigned a giant credit
card number at birth, where longev-
ity will be greater, where communi-
cations and transportation will be
revolutionized, and where science
will combine forces with farmers to
find far more productive means of
using land.

At Springs
Five Royals Also Signed
For Rock and Roll Show

By LEWIS MILLER
Ed Croft, President of the University Dance Board, an-
nounced today that the Crystals, the Chiffons, and the Five
Royals will be featured at the Saturday night concert of Springs
Weekend. The concert will be in keeping with past weekends
in that a rock-and-roll type of music will be presented. All three

groups have achieved national fame as recording artists.
*

Along with the announcement of
the entertainment for Springs Week-
end, Steve Smith, president of the
dance weekend, announced the
theme for the two concerts. Dore-
mus Gymnasium will be decorated
to fit the theme on “Night of the
Satyr.” Jim Slay, vice-president in
charge of decorations, plans to have
the gymnasium atmosphere resem-
ble a woodlands festival. The object
of the theme is to present a cele-
bration of the deity of Pan and
Bacchus.

‘He’s So Fine’

The Chiffons burst upon the na-
tional music scene in the winter of
1963 with a tremendous explosion
which electrified the entire record
business. In a few short weeks their
recording of He’s So Fine was at the
top of the national popularity charts.
It stayed at the top for well over
a month, a long time in the days
of fast moving record hits. The re-
cording sold over a million copies.

The Chiffons continued their suc-
cess with their recording of One
Fine Day and history repeated it-
self. Today the Chiffons are rated as
one of the top female vocal groups

in the country. They are a tremen-
dous success on the concert and one
nighter show circuit.

They have a unique and instantly
identifiable sound and _ style. At
present they have recorded two
long-playing albums, both of which
have equalled the measure of suc-
cess that their single recordings did.

The Crystals

The Crystals hit the national re-
cord scene with their single record-
ing of Da Doo Ron Ron, He’s Sure
the Boy I Love, and Then He Kissed
Me. The Crystals following in the
style originated by the Shirelles,
have also seen a great amount of
success in the popular music field.

The Crystals, an older group than
the Chiffons, have at present been
travelling on the night club circuit,
playing for extended periods in
such cities as Washington, Philadel-
phia, New York (the Apollo Night
Club), and in numerous Southern
cities.

The Crystals have also had a mil-
lion selling recording, He’s Sure the
Boy I Love. In addition they have
recorded two albums and have been
one of the featured groups in two
more.

The Five Royals appeared on
campus in 1962 when they played for
the school cocktail party in Red
Square. The Royals have recorded
such hits as Think, Please, Please,
Please, and It’s Just What I Want.

The group has appeared on a
number of rock-and-roll shows over
the past few years, and have had
recordings listed in the “Top Ten”
a number of times.

The Saturday night concert will
be held in Doremus Gymnasium,

April 18, from eight to ten o'clock.

On Friday night the featured art-
ist will be Dave Brubeck, one of
the several most outstanding pro-
ponents of jazz.

IFC Fails To Ratify
M embership Proposal

At its Monday night meeting the
IFC failed to pass a proposal to
increase its membership. The de-
feated proposal called for each fra-
ternity to be represented by its
president and two elected IFC mem-
bers.

The IFC currently includes each
house president and only one elect-
ed representative from each house.
In an 11-7 vote, the proposal to in-
crease membership was backed by a
majority but failed to obtain a
needed two-thirds vote.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

Some Flies In The Ointment

Dr Feddeman is right; the school doctor is indeed, along
with such things as dining hall food, a perennial subject of crit-
icism. This fact, though, does not automatically negate criticism
directed again the school physician, which although it has been
present on campus for years, is only now being voiced. Nor does
the criticism of the university physician rest only on “four cases
drawn from over the past six years’ mentioned in both of the
past two editions of the Ring-tum Phi. Case after case could be
presented which reflect poorly on the university doctor as a
physician. If the record were to be examined there is no doubt
that the results would prove that criticism has not “been blown
all out of proportion,” as the Tuesday edition claims. So far
it has been modest.

But even without rushing into charges of ‘incompetence’
and listing cases, elements of the infirmary situation can be
pointed out which seriously need improvement.

In the first place, the university doctor is too hard to see
during the short time he is in his campus office. He is only
there for a couple of hours each morning, and if a student has
classes during these hours, he just can’t see the doctor. The
physician doesn’t arrive at his office until about 9:00, and if a
man has an 8:25 class, it is perfectly impossible for him to get
an excuse from the doctor for this class—since, according to
Absence Regulations, “a student must report to the medical
office preceding any class he may miss in order to obtain a medi-
cal excuse.” This means that the man either goes to class sick,
or he must take the chance that the doctor will give him an
excuse once he arrives at the infirmary. The Absence Regu-
lations are set by the faculty, it is true, and so the school doctor
cannot correct this situation; unless he chooses to come to work
a little earlier.

This leads up to the second point: it is truly “taking a
chance” to count on getting an excuse from the school doctor,
because he seems to assume the attitude that a student is
healthy until proven sick—by himself. In other words, he
treats the entire college population as if it were a grade school
class trying to get out of school for a day by feigning an upset
stomach. Contrary to infirmary opinion, college students do
not stay up nights plotting tricks to put over on the college
doctor. On the contrary, they pay for the privilege of classes,
and they realize that their education depends on good use of
class time.

Third, it is the position of the other doctors in Lexington,
that the university physician is the “family doctor’ of the
W&L student body; that is, there is an idea that every W&L
student is a patient of the school doctor, and therefore no
other doctor in town dares to treat a student—out of respect
for A.M.A. ethics. If a student goes to the hospital he is told
that “only the school doctor” can handle his case. Yet he is
obviously not the physician of every student’s choice, and so
this misconception should be disregarded. If a student feels
that the service provided by the university is less than the best
available, he should be able to go to any physician in Lexing-
ton, and do so without permission from the infirmary.

Finally, why is the infirmary staff so anxious to call a
pharmacy and give a student a prescription every time he’s
sick—at the student’s expense? Why can’t the infirmary pro-
vide medicine? Or just what does the “infirmary fee” paid by
every student go to buy? If it is used to provide the present
degree of infirmary service, there are probably a few students
who would rather use their money for medicine than for the
service.

The object of this editorial is not to question “Dr. Fedde-
man’s so-called incompetence,” as the Tuesday edition so
aptly puts it. Actually, most residents of Lexington recognize
him as one of Lexington’s leading obstetricians. His patients
speak very highly of him, and so he is due every respect.
Nevertheless, it seems that he can do a much better job in the
infirmary, both in his treatment of students and in the rules
by which the infirmary is run.

able farce. The color is badly done;
this would have been better in black

total loss, another Brando effort that
bungled. The dialogue might appear
subtle to an eight-year old, especial-
ly the enthralling moment when
Brando screams, “you scum-sucking

This one is strictly for townies. The

God Is Dead --- Part One

 

Gospels As Ultimate Truth Refuted

One of the cardinal virtues in
the career of college students is
the quest for truth. This ideal is
particularly vital to a_ society
whose bannerhead is Progress and
Achievement. But truth, if un-
challenged, will have no stimulus
for growth.

For this reason, we extol the
cynic, the common man's gadfly.
It is for this reason also that we
ourselves shall assume the role of
the cynic, with the ulterior motive
of promoting truth. The role we
are presently undertaking is that
of a Devil's Advocate to an in-
stitution which, because of its ex-
treme conservatism, its inability to
adjust to a changing society, has
made of “truth” mere blind dog-
ma. We refer, of course, to the
Christian Church and the sort of
faith it professes persistently to
a no longer gullible society. Be-
low, in our first of a series, we
shall assault one of the corner-
stones of the Christian Church
dogma—the New Testament.

By KEN LANE
Editor-in-Chief

The New Testament as it exists
today is a miscellaneous collection
of historical records and theological
speculation. That it has become an
ultimate authority within the Church
is about to develop into an Achil-
les’ heel for all of modern Christian-
dom. What is making the Church
weaker in this respect is that schol-
ars, through advanced technology,
are discovering more and more
about this best-seller document, and
the more they discover about it,
the more it loses any aura of au-
thenticity.

The haphazard way in which the
content of the New Testament was
assembled and passed down from
eentury to century is enough to
shake one’s faith. First of all, it is
improbable that any of the Gospel-
writers ever saw the main Charac-
ter of the respective narratives; at
the most, they relied simply on sur-
viving testimonies and memoirs of
the original Twelve. The Gospel of
Mark, which was the primary source
of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke,
was written around 70 A.D. Many
feel that much of the material in-
corporated in this book was dic-
tated by the Apostle Peter. Luke
was written between 70 and 80 A.D.;
Matthew around 90 A.D. It is vir
tually impossible that the latter was
written by the Apostle Matthew;
assuming that he had been born
earlier than Christ, Matthew would
probably have exceeded one hun-
dred years old by the time of his
alleged authorship. The date of the
Gospel of John has been set some-
time after 100 A.D. and obviously
could not have been written by the
apostle.

Countless Inconsistencies

Partly because they were written
so long after the time of Christ
by persons with little or no first-
hand experience, the Gospels man-
ifest countless contradictions and in-
consistencies. A study of the surviv-
ing manuscripts of the New Testa-
ment reveals nearly 175,000 discrep-
ancies. Though mainly of minor sig-
nificance, some of these disagree-
ments are glaring. The reports of
the Sermon on the Mount, in Mat-
thew and Luke, are in many places
outright contradictions. Matthew,
Luke and John differ hopelessly
about the anointing of Jesus, both
as to the time and place. Matthew
and Mark tell one story of the trial
of Jesus; Luke tells a second; John
tells a third. Even the accounts
of such critical events as the Cruci-
fixion and the Resurrection radi-
cally disagree.

One matter that seriously detracts
from the authenticity of the New
Testament is the great amount of
tampering of scriptural passages by
early scholars of the Church. Con-
sequently, many doctrines im-
plicit in the modern-day Gospels
were most probably unknown to
Christ himself.

Inserted “Truths”

The doctrine of the Trinity, for
example finds little Biblical substan-
tiation except through interpolations
made by scholars in copying orig-
inal texts. One of the key verses
that allude to this doctrine is Christ’s
statement in Matthew: “Go ye
therefore, and teach all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.” However, neither
Mark (which was the principle
source of Matthew) nor Luke make
any mention of this statement, and
in the Acts of the Apostles baptism
is performed in the name of Jesus
alone. More than likely, some the-
ologian added the verse at some
time after the Church had begun
to accept the Trinitarian doctrine.

 

Yum Tree (a phallic title par ex- |

Another interpolated verse is the| left are the snake-charmers in the

mandate which Mark ascribes
Christ as: “Go ye into the world,
and preach the gospel to every crea-
ture’—a command that has served
as a key impetus to the church’s mis-
sionary efforts. This verse is missing
from most of the early texts; Luke
and Matthew make no mention of it,
although both had used Mark as a
chief source. The verses immediately
following were also probably in-
serted long after the original text.
These contain Christ’s description
of the true believers: “in my name
they will cast out demons; they will
speak in new tongues; they will pick
up serpents, and if they drink any
deadly thing, it will not hurt them;
they will lay their hands on the
sick, and they will recover (by these

criteria, the only true Christians

 

to| back hills of Tennessee!).

A Triumph for Christ

The most disillusioning inconsis-
tencies of the Gospel involves the
portrayal of Christ himself. Each
of the authors presents a Messiah
that in certain ways is distinct from
any of the others. For example, while
Mark presents a somewhat human-
ist Christ, that in Matthew and Luke
is especially mystical. Even more
upsetting, however, is the schizo-
phrenic Christ, who one day is meek
and compassionate, the next, bitter
and high-strung. One story that il-
lustrates the latter side of this per-
sonality is that of Christ and the
Gadarene. Christ and his disciples
had disembarked on one of the re-
mote shores of the Sea of Galilee.
On ascending the lofty cliffs, they
encountered a hermit named Legion,

 

so called because he was possessed
with thousands of demons. Christ
and these demons engaged in a
somewhat spirited dispute. Christ
got the better of his antagonists by
casting them all into the numerous
swine that grazed nearby. Seized of
these spirits, the beasts stampeded
over the cliffs and drowned in the
sea below. This for the people of
Gadarene meant the loss of their
chief means of livelihood; they were
unimpressed by Christ’s show of
power and invited the Messiah and
his disciples to leave. For the town
of Gadarene, it had been a day of
irrevocable loss. For the disciples,
it had been a day of triumph and
its recording became a part of
the Inspired Word!

Medicine’s Deficiencies Evident;
Socialism Might Be The Answer

By SYD LEWIS

Americans must be willing to face
the medical problems of the twen-
tieth century with an open mind.
Certainly, the national security and
well being of the country is depend-
ent to some degree on the health
of the nation.

Nevertheless, no matter what your
doctor or the A.M.A. might tell you,
the United States is undoubtedly
not the healthiest nation in the
world. It is appalling to hear that
the death rates among infants in
the United States is 28 per thousand
while in Finland (21 per 1,000) and
in four other Western nations the
figure is lower than ours. The death
rates among infants under one year
of age in the U.S. (27 per 1,000) is
not up to par compared with such
countries as Sweden (17 per 1,000),
the Netherlands, Switzerland, and
the United Kingdom. The death rate
from whooping cough, an easily con-
trolable sickness if the patient re-
ceives proper medical attention in
time, is twice that of Sweden’s.
With the development of antibiotics,
there is no reason why the death
rate from pneumonia in the United
States should not be the lowest in
the world, for we have the wealth
to purchase and distribute these
drugs; however, Denmark only has
two-thirds as many deaths from
this disease. Finally, the actual death
rate is higher in the United States
than in Canada, Norway, the Neth-
erlands, and Finland—that is, life
expectency is not highest in the
US.

U.S. Behind in Research

Furthermore, the United States is
not the leader in all fields of medical
research; yet with a gross national
product of almost $600,000,000,000,
we certainly have the capacity to
build the necessary laboratories if
able men can be convinced to enter
research. France (bacteriology),
England (anti-septic surgery), Ger-
many (chemotherapy), and Czecho-
slovakia (blood typing) are ex-
amples of countries which have
equalled or surpassed America in
certain fields.

American medicine has also failed
to produce enough physicians to fill
our growing needs. The A.M.A. esti-
mates (probably overstimates) that
there is one physician for every 750
residents of the U.S. while Iseral has

LETTERS

EpiroR

I have been encouraged by the
recent appearance of an issue which
promises to awaken the campus from
its listless apathy. There are two
reasons for my optimism over the
discussion of desegregation: first, the
issue threatens to foree W&L out
of its intellectual sterility and cre-
ate from the resulting maturity a
truly intellectual atmosphere where
ideas and issues of universal and
lasting importance, such as race re-
lations, morals, and politics, ean be
debated rationally. Secondly, I am
strongly in favor of desegregation
of W&L and consequently weleome
this open discussion which can only
benefit all those concerned.

But let us be alerted to the real
issue, let us immerse ourselves in
its technicalities and its conse-
quences. For the numerous pale
Dick Gregorys who rationalize
their prejudiced views and stereo-
types under an attempted veneer
of humor have no place in the dis-

one physician per 467 residents.
State mental hospitals have stated
they need 3,700 more doctors. At
one time 5,091 of 25,616 A.M.A. ap-
proved hospital residences were va-
cant, and at the same time 2,010
of 11,616 A.M.A. approved intern-
ship positions were without doctors.
Approximately 37,000,000 Ameri-
cans are without local health de-
partments. Many believe that the
A.M.A., the powerful doctor’s “labor
union,” has played an important part
in creating this deficiency through
trying to keep the pay up by keep-
ing supply down.

The A.M.A, asserts that our type
of medicine is the best (earlier
paragraphs have discounted this)
because of the freedom of choice
of doctor and the patient-doctor
relationship. But how effective is
one’s choice of doctor? There is
no guide. Most choices are made
by recommendation, tradition, or
by merely running one’s finger
through the telephone book.

Furthermore, doctors have been
criticized for their dollar doctrine.
Most doctors are not predominant-
ly money-conscious; however, it is
the doctrine of the A.M.A. to charge
according to one’s ability to pay.
How would students like it if they
were charged extra for beers be-
cause they had more ability to pay
than a townie? Why then should
we allow doctors to use their mon-

 

opolistic powers in a similar way?
Americans are protected from mono-
polistic businesses; they need to be
protected from doctors!

Is Socialism an Ancwer?

What is the answer to the medical
question? Socialism? We certainly
do not claim to know the answer.
We do know that more doctors must
be produced—we need more medi-
cal schools. Men of ability must not
be scored away from medicine be-
cause of the cost of education. Sal-
aries of research positions must be
increased to induce men to follow
this field. Patients must be pro-
tected from unfair fees and prac-
tices. We as citizens have a right
to some control over doctors—our
investments in physicians is hugh.
Thirteen billion dollars ($70,000 per
doctor) is invested in public hos-
pitals alone.

Socialism, of course, is an an-
swer to the problem. Many claim
that this means has been highly
successful in Great Britain. If the
A.M.A. does no solve their own
deficiences in medicine, I am sure
that the American public will
awaken to the fact that social ac-
tion must be taken.

H ell- Raisers Were Here 'To Learn;
Yet They Also Had Fun Doing It

By DREW BAUR
Friday Columnist

The editorial in the Tuesday edi-

tion is worthy of some further com-

ments. There will

4) be many who

' shall disregard

1 this article as nos-

talgic thoughts of

the “good old

days.” However,

it would be wrong

to dismiss this as

mere reverie, be-

eause unfortun-
ately it is true.

The men of the
“good old days”
article said, fiercely
school and their fra-
ternity. They were proud of their
football team, proud of the “cutting
up” of the Minks, 13 Club, and White
Friars. This was the other side of
their education, but nevertheless a
side,

The Gulicks, Scharnbergs, Suss-
mans, and Sparks were a hangover
of other times. They added a zest
and liveliness to Washington and
Lee that cannot be replaced by long

were, as the
loyal to their

 

hair and snobbery. They were here
to learn, but to have fun doing it.

No one questions now (and I
doubt that they ever did question)
that a college is for academic pur-
suits. Apparently, there is now a
strong trend at W&L to produce
the academic wizard, rather than
the “all-around man,” Yet, per-
haps there is something else to
college besides a 3.0, though God
help anyone around here who
dares suggest such a thing.

This is not a call for riotous rev-
elry, but merely a suggestion that
maybe we ought to take ourselves
less seriously. End of sermon.

In a few weeks the new IFC rush
proposals will go before the houses
for approval. The tremendous
amount of time and effort which the
committee on Rush Week put in on
these proposals demands a careful
consideration of them by every
member of every fraternity.

Phi Kap Wins Meet;
Takes 7 of 16 Events

By TOM WHITE

Rich Hartgrove (three firsts) and
John Laimbeer (two first) led Phi
Kappa Sig to the 1964 intramural
track and field championship Tues-
day afternoon.

In rolling to first place, the Phi
Kaps piled up 124 points, 64 more
than second place Lambda Chi. They
placed at least one person among
the top five finishers in each event
but the pole vault.

All in all, it was a good week
for the Phi Kaps, who added a first
in table tennis and a second in
bowling, won by Kappa Sig. This
combined toe give a tremendous
boost to Pi Kappa Sig’s chances
at the intramural championship.

Hartgrove led them in the track
meet with 30 points on firsts in
the triple jump, high jump and
broad jump. Laimbeer, winner last
fall of the Turkey Trot, captured
first place in both the mile and
880.

Gasque Nears Record

Phi Gam’s Gay Gasque was the
meet’s only other double winner. He
outelassed the opposition in both
the shot put and discus, adding a
fifth place finish in the javelin.

Gasque’s 43’ 914” shot put ap-
proaches the school mark of 45’ 8”
set in 1957 by A. B. Platt.

Other notable individual perform-
ances were recorded by Lambda
Chi’s Bob Bigham (first in the 440,
second in the 220) and Phi Kappa
Sig’s Bob Phillips (second in the
triple jump, third in the broad
jump).

Delt, SAE and Beta bunched to-
gether to round out the top five
finishers. The team scores: 1. Phi
Kappa Sig, 124; 2. Lambda Chi, 60;
3. Delt, 52-4. SAE, Si; 5. Beta, 47;
6. Sigma Chi, 33; 7. Sigma Nu, 24;
8. Phi Gam, 22; 9. ZBT, 20; 10. KA,
18; 11. Phi Psi, 16; 12. PiKA, 9; 13.
DU 8; 14. PEP, 7; 15. NFU, 4. Kappa
Sig and SPE, the only other entrants,
failed to score.

When participation points were
added, Delt and SAE both moved
up a notch, dropping Lambda Chi
to fourth, KA jumped from tenth
to fifth.

16 events and captured three seconds

mural director.

mages pitting the attack and defensive specialists of both teams

against each other. Tuesday at 3:15 p.m. there will be a full
*scale scrimmage.

Coach Bob McHenry will be tak-
ing a team into this game which,
while it has remarkablly more depth
and talent that W&L lacrosse teams
are accustomed to having, still has
problems at both the defensive and
attack positions.

Randy Wootton’s achilles tendon
injury and Bob Hankey’s pulled leg
muscle place them both on the
doubtful list, seriously hampering
the attack game. Goalie Pete Noonan
has been slowed by a knee injury,
but will probably start against
Swarthmore.

Midfield Strongest

Midfield appears to be McHenry’s
strongest position. Instead of the
old W&L five man rotation system,
the team’s weakest point in recent
seasons, McHenry now has three
solid and comparatively equal mid-
fields to work with. The added depth
should be the team’s greatest asset
this season.

Last year W&L defeated Swarth-
more in in pre-season scrimmage,
9-3, but this year could be a differ-
ent story. Swarthmore has virtually
the same team back and has added
some excellent freshmen prospects,
notably at attack.

McHenry sees the game as a good
testing ground for his various units,
and as a chance to develop their
team play. It should also help
settle the remaining contests for
team positions.

Baseball Team
To Play VMI

In Scrimmages

Two weekend scrimmage games
with Virginia Military should set
the Washington and Lee baseball
team for the annual spring jaunt.

The Generals meet VMI on Smith
field both Saturday and Sunday at
3 p.m,

Two fielding positions and the
pitching staff are still in question as
the team prepares for its trip, which
will begin next Saturday at Pfeiffer
College in North Carolina.

Coach Joe Lyles will take 23 tol].
25 of his 30-man team on the trip.

Two Men Injured

The status of Earl McGowin, the
right-handed pitcher with an in-
jured shoulder, is still uncertain. He
will see a Lynchburg specialist this
weekend. Tom Crenshaw, a VMI
transfer and Lyles’ number one
eatcher, is also nursing a sore arm.

Chris Wigert and Brice Gamber,
a pair of southpaws, are thus far
the only sure spots on the pitching
staff. Freshman Roy Powell heads
a group of right-handers that in-
cludes Terry Herman, Pete Heu-
mann and Scott Lavery.

First base and center field are
the other positions where the start-
ers are uncertain. At first, Jim
Crothers and Skip Chase are vying
for the position left by Howard
Martin, who will not play this year.

Either of two freshmen, Gene
Gillespie or Scott Miller, will play
center. Elsewhere in the outfield,
Pete Candler will be in left, Ashley
Allen in right.

In the infield, Lou Flannagan
will start at second, Lou Paterno at
third, and Dave Kirkpatrick at
shortstop.

Picture Changes

Lyles said that with only two reg-
ulars graduating he had thought the
team would be in good shape. Then
Eric Sisler, a .400 hitter, and Bob
Taylor flunked out, and Martin and
Doug Davis decided not to play.
W&L will probably have trouble
reaching .500.

The full schedule: Mar. 26: Buck-
nell, Mar. 28: at Pfeiffer, Mar. 30, 31

If he repeats his

the playing field. Seating capaci-
ty—46,730.

The cost for such a worthwhile
structure is estimated at a paltry
$23,500,000. So far no one has come
up with any ideas on how to raise
the money.

Charles Goren, in his recent
Sports Illustrated series, offered some
advice from George S. Kaufman on
playing winning bridge.

“It was George who pointed out
that you could always hold good
cards merely by sitting South. He
said, ‘No matter who writes the
books or articles, South holds the
most terrific cards I ever saw.
There is a lucky fellow if I ever
saw one.’

“Ever since then I have sat South.
That is the secret of my success.”

Aspiring Gorens should note this
bit of wisdom.

nonsense. Peale is about one-tenth
the man Dr. Marshall was, and the
film that has been made of his life,
One Man’s Way, is strictly pie-in-
the-sky corn. I suppose the Protes-
tants felt that they needed a pub-
licity film to state their side of the
Word since Preminger supplied the

tunately, they now have a movie
worse than Preminger’s, which was
a pretty difficult thing to do.

The cast of A Gathering of Eagles
about some sad SACS is illustrative
of those on campus who would ban
the Seuthern Collegian—half flamed
and half flew....Bette Davis will
play the role of Martha in the movie
version of Albee’s Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?....M-G-M is con-
templating a remake of Lady Chat-

cussion on this campus. What we}
urgently need is a rational debate
of the true issue between students,
townspeople, professors, and _ trust-
tees. And so I issue a challenge to
everyone concerned to express their
beliefs openly for only from such
a free exchange can we move to-
ward truth.

I suggest we begin these polemics
in the Letter to the Editor column
of this paper.

Sincerely,

ZBT Takes Second

Phi Kappa Sig won their second
championship Tuesday night, defeat-
ing ZBT in table tennis. The Phi
Kaps had earlier beaten Sigma Nu
5-0 and DU 3-2.

ZBT settled for second, on the
strength of a 3-2 decision of DU
and a forfeit win over Sigma Nu,
who also forfeited to DU, giving
them third place in the tournament.

Kappa Sig ruined Phi Kappa Sig’s
bid for a third intramural title in
one day when they beat them 2396-
2184 in bowling that same evening.

Jim Bussart rolled high game, a
204, for the Phi Kaps, but it wasn’t
enough to overcome Kappa Sig’s
high scoring duo of Tom Pace and
Steve Thompson, who bowled re-
spective 536 and 533 series.

With John Heinzerling bowling a
214, and Joe Wheeler a 198, SAE
took third place, downing Phi Psi
2154-1906.

Volleyball began last night, with
Phi Gam the defending school
champion.
