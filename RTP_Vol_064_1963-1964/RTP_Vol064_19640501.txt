New Trends

In California

Forecast Victory To Rocky

Washington and Lee’s Mock Re-|
publican Convention is predicting
that Nelson Rockfeller will upset
Senator Barry Goldwater in the
California primary.

Rocky Gets Votes

The GOP Chairman for California
announced today that he will cast
his state’s 86 votes for Rockefeller
in the W&L Convention on May 4.
His decision, (made after intensive
study of the Rocky-Goldwater fight
in California), is based on the be-
lief that the New York governor
will come from behind and defeat

 

Goldwater; thus insuring Rockefeller |
California’s block of 86 votes on at!
least the first two ballots.

The California chairman, senior |
Jim Sylvester, analyzed every poll |
taken in California in the last|
few months. He received advice and
campaign details from both Gold-
water and Rockefeller campaign
headquarters in Washington and!
California. |

Rocky On Rise

Sylvester admits that if the pri-
mary were held this week, Gold-
wate would win comfortably. But
he lists four factors which he thinks
will enable Rockefeller to pull away
from the Arizonian during the next
month. The first prediction is that
Rockefeller will do unexpectedly
well in the Oregon primary on May
15, and that his campaign will take
on new energy thereafter.

The second factor favoring Rocke-
feller is that more voters than usual
will turn out for this primary, be-
cause of the frenzied activity of both
camps. A large turnout will benefit
Rockefeller because Goldwater’s
strength is in a “hard core” of dedi-
cated Republicans who are not like-

ly to increase in numbers any more
than they already have. Rockefeller,
though, expects to attract much ad-
ditional support in his thorough
criss-crossing the state.
Lodge Is Favorite

Third, says Sylvester, Rockefeller
will begin to attract the active sup-
port of those whose first choice
is Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge,
the most popular candidate in Cal-
ifornia. Lodge’s moderate following
will vote very heavily for Rocke-

Dr. Baumann
Discusses Ideas

Of C. G. Jung
By SAM McCHESNEY

Analytic psychiatrist Dr. Dieter
Baumann spoke on “An Example of
Dream Interpretation” in duPont
Auditorium last Wednesday night.

Dr. Baumann opened his lecture
with a discussion of C. G. Jung’s
theories. Dr. Jung stated that there
were two parts to the psychic, the
ego and the unconscious. He stated
that ego dealt with the central point
of reference, whereas the uncon-
scious was manifested in intangible
forms such as dreams.

Dr. Baumann followed this with
the problem of interpreting a dream.
Baumann stated that when a dream
was interpreted the patient felt a
sense of relief. The patient actually
became more alive. This is caused
by the release of energy stored in
the unconscious to the conscious.

Dream Interpretation

In trying to interpret a dream,
Baumann followed a_ general
pattern. First, he asks the patient
what has happened to him recent-
ly. In this way Dr. Baumann can
see what the patient feels and from
that discover what the dream refers
to. Sometimes he has his patient
write out his dream since it gives
the patient “a dedication of atten-
tion to the dream.”

After attempting to find out what
the patient feels, Dr. Baumann pro-
ceeds to ask the patient what comes
to his mind when a segment of the
dream is recalled. With this informa-
tion in mind Dr. Baumann attempts
an interpretation. In order to in-
terpret the dream satisfactorily, Dr.
Baumann states that an agreement
must exist between the patient and
the interpretor.

Two Hindrances

Dr. Baumann states that two fac-
tors can hinder the interpretor’s
understanding of the dream. First,
the analyst and the patient might
have the same problem. Also, the
interpretor can lack knowledge to
interpret certain symbols. In this
case he has to check a general file
of symbol interpretations and in this
way find the answer to the problem.

Dr. Baumann then referred the
audience to a dream of a 33-year-
old woman. This lady, who lived in
an apartment, dreamed that she
heard a moan from her guest room.
She walked near the guest room
bookcase and felt the floor move, as
if she were standing on someone.
She left the room, and her dog
came into the guest room and began
tearing up the floor. In so doing
the dog uncovered a body. The dead
body great stench. At
this time the dreamer was awaken
by her alarm clock.

Dr. Baumann had to this
problem. Following the procedure
before, he discover that the patient

Sophomore Class

In the rising Sophomore Class
Bryant Kendrick, a Phi Delt won the
EC post over Kirk Follo, an SAE,

more votes than any other candidate
defeating ZBT Stuart Finestone, 150-
104. Barry Vaught, a KA took the
Vice President's spot over Chuck
Staples. Reform candidate Roper
Vaughan pulled the surprise of the
night when he coped the secretary
spot. Vaughan is a Phi Delt. Ken
Greene, a ZBT, edged Lambda Chi
Skip Brooks for the historian post.

“I believe we did have the best
candidates,” said Progressive Party
chairman Tom Pace. “Apparently the
student body agreed. That we were
pleased is undoubtedly true, how-
ever, we were also disappointed in
several cases. We believe the student
body is now more interested in
electing the best candidates than
playing the game of party politics.
We can only hope that best men
were elected.”

The Progressive Party seemed to
vote straight tickets while pulling
votes from the UP in the upper class
elections.

we were somewhat disappointed,

members.”

Jere Turner and Bob Pless were
elected Wednesday night to repre-
sent the Intermediate and Senior
Law students respectively.

Qualifications

Carrell, who is an SAE from
Pensacola, Florida, is on the Dean’s
List, the Student Service Society,
and SWMSFC. This year he was
the Circulation Manager of the
Ring-tum Phi, and next year will
serve as Business Manager. During
this year he served as chairman of
the Liberty Hall Committee and as
a fraternity officer.

Geer, who is a Phi Delt from
Spartanburg, South Carolina, is
treasurer of SWMSFC and his fra-
ternity. He also played an active
part in the Student Service So-
ciety. He is a member of the “13”
Club, a varsity swimmer and was
elected this week as a dormitory
counselor for next year.

Mindel, who is a ZBT, from Tole-
do, has been active in varsity
basketball, the Student Service So-
ciety, the Liberty Hall Society,
the Calyx and Ring-tum Phi. He is
a fraternity officer and is on the
Dean’s List.

Walker, who is a Kappa Sig from
San Antonio, will be returning for
his second year on the EC. He is
on the Honor Roll and Dean’s List,
SWMFC, the Liberty Hall Society,
Shenandoah Business Staff, Dance
Board Advisory Committee. He was
chosen the IFC Outstanding Fresh-
man in 1963 and is a fraternity of-
ficer.

Kendrick, who is a Phi Delt from
Greenville, South Carolina, is the
captain of both the freshman foot-
ball and lacrosse teams. This year he
has been in the UCA, and served as
the freshman representative to the
Assimilation Committee.

 

Reform Party
Wins Position

The newly organized Reform Par-
ty succeeded in the election of its
candidate for secretary of the Soph-
omore Class. Roper Vaughan, Phi
Delt was elected by a wide margin
after being nominated by Bill Bab-
cock, an SAE freshman, in a
denunciation of “big clique” nom-
inating and manipulation.

Vaughan Kidnapped

It was said that the party leaders
had exerted pressure on Vaughan to
withdraw from the race; the Reform
Party backers, however, determined
not to see their efforts thwarted,
kidnapped their candidate so that
he was not able to decline his nom-
ination at the class assembly. Upon
his release, Vaughan pointed out
that his intention to withdraw from
the race did not indicate his un-
willingness to serve in the office
of secretary but merely his obli-
gation to his fraternity, which had
been erroneously blamed for his
candidacy.

Reform Policy

In his speech, Babcock lashed out
at “straight party” voting, suggest-
ing that voting should be for the
best man in the best interest of the
school, rather than in the interest
of fraternities. He challenged the as-
sembled voters to accept the Re-
form Party’s platform by electing
their candidate, and declared that if
the Reform Party were successful,
it would hold open primaries in the
elections of next year.

This year’s Reform Party is un-
affiliated with any reform move-
ments of previous years. It is an ef-
fort to start a process of evolution
which would end, it is hoped, in
a more democratic campus political
system.

A Needed Improvement

By its assent to the new Rush Week proposal last Monday,

the Interfraternity Council offered further testimony of that
Body’s resurrection this year.

The traditional system for Rush Week has been a constant
sore spot with the IFC for many years. Three of the prover-
bial criticisms have been the stampedes into the domitories,
the traffic problem, and the freshmen’s immediate and over-
whelming exposure to a drinking atmosphere. Although in
previous years committees had been set up by the IFC in an
attempt to resolve these problems, no alternative plan was
drafted that could be found equitable by all the houses.

That such a plan has at last been realized, as is the case
if and when it receives a second three-fourths majority vote
next Monday, could only be the result of concentrated work
and patient deliberation on the part of this year’s Rush Com-
mittee. On paper, the proposal is very cogent and if backed
by strong leadership, it may provide W&L with its first non-
devastating Rush Week next fall. We wish the IFC, and in
particular next year’s rush chairmen, the best of luck in put-
ting this plan successfully into effect.

An Educational Experience

The second page is dedicated to providing an in-
sight into the prospects of the six major Republican
candidates. Each candidate has been reviewed by his or
her respective campaign manager.

This weekend will probably be the most enjoyable and edu-
cational one we will spend in four years at W&L. Everything
points to the creation of an excitement that is generally felt
only at the national conventions.

The political eyes of the United States will be directed
towards Washington and Lee’s famed Mock Convention as an
indication of what will happen in July at the San Francisco
Republican Convention.

By BILL BURKE

Senator Barry Goldwater and his
policies and proposals have been
widely discussed throughout the
nation for some time. He has always
been willing to discuss the issues in
a free and straightforward manner,
and this quality has been immensely
refreshing in American politics; poli-
tics that are usually marked with
deception and platitudes.

Civil Rights
He has always made a sharp dis-
tinction between the civil rights that
are guaranteed under the Constitu-

 

tion and the rights of association
which are basically moral issues and
cannot be solved by passing un-
enforceable federal laws. There-
fore he feels that the proposed pub-
lic accommodations section is an
example where the new laws will
only hinder and not help the cause
of racial tolerance.

On foreign aid Goldwater has
said that he was “opposed to for-
eign economic aid as it is pres-
ently conceived and administer-
ed” but he supports “military and
technical assistance; the former to

 

protect our friends against Com-
munist aggression and the latter
to help nations help themselves.”
He would encourage less inter-
ference and more results in our
foreign aid program and “less
money better spent.”

Goldwater is for a free world
market in international trade and
has said that “expanding interna-
tional trade is most important to the
well being of the people of the

Senator Goldwater has repeatedly
stated that the right to strike “con-

It is because of its unique position as a replica of the na-

Convention is receiving much nation-wide emphasis. This
emphasis will, of course, extend to the Washington and Lee

student body because of the very nature of the Convention.

From the very beginning, Gov-
ernor Nelson A. Rockefeller has
been an announced candidate. This
has had both its advantages and
disadvantages. With the progression
of any campaign, people are con-
stantly going to find points of con-
tention to use against the candidate.
But Rockefeller has remained rela-

is: Will Rockefeller get the nomi-
nation both here at W&L and again
in July? It is my firm belief that
he will. The following are some of
the reasons why Governor Rocke-
feller should be the GOP’s choice.

are looking for a candidate who can

is Rockefeller, for with him we

Nixon As

By JACK YARBROUGH

In a survey conducted by the As-
sociated Press which started on
April 1, correspondents in the 50
states and District of Columbia
questioned more than 3000 county
chairman, vice chairmen, town lead-
ers, and other party leaders as
to who they thought would get the
Republican nomination this summer.
This survey indicated that Richard
Nixon would get the nomination
and be the national standard bearer
for the Republicans in 1964.

sponsibility and unquestioned un-
derstanding of both foreign and do-
mestice affairs.

An important point that should
be made is what exactly it takes
to get elected, besides the man him-
self. It is time to face the cold hard
facts realistically. Money and or-
ganization are the two keys to a
successful campaign. Rockefeller has
both.

The Republican Party realizes the
tremendous odds they are up against
in this coming election, and they
are looking for a candidate who
has both the funds and the organiza-
tion to wage an all out battle.
Rockefeller is the only man who
could successfully do this. Just re-
flect on what gave the late President
Kennedy the victory: his resoruces
and organization.

Stabilization

Along with these two criteria, the
party is looking for a man who will
stabilize the party. This can only be
done by selecting a candidate who
will be able to battle Johnson to the
end. Rockefeller can and will rally
the support of the party. He is also
the most likely candidate to pick
up support from the other party.

next Tuesday.

One other thing should be pointed
out here. There are several states
that will give their delegates to
favorite sons. Included among these
are Kentucky, Wisconsin, Ohio, and
Minnesota. If Nixon could pick up
some of these delegates on the sec-
ond ballot, and make a good show-
ing, his chances will be very good.

If and when
support,
Nixon will be around to pick up

Thus far only Goldwater and Nix-
have been mentioned as contenders
for the nomination. It would be a
to overlook Rockefeller,
Scranton, and Lodge. Both Scranton
and Lodge—despite the fact that
they, like Nixon, have not campaign-
ed in any primary election nor said
they are candidates for the nomina-
tion—received many more votes in
they re-
in October and December.
Rockefeller, who is campaigning for
the nomination ran last in October

out of the White House is through
a completely unified party effort. He
feels that the only way the Re-
publicans can gain this unity is
through the draft of a candidate ac-
ceptable to all.

For some reason or another, all
the other possible candidates are
not acceptable to the party as a unit,
either due to issues that they are
for or against, past records, or per-
sonal problems. Many of Scranton’s
backers feel that he can supply the
Republican Party with the unity
that they need so badly. He is an
intelligent, attractive candidate. His
record as the Governor of Pennsyl-
vania has been almost beyond re-
proach, His family heritage is root-

 

ed deep in Republican Party loy-

alty. He has attacked no candidate
to date, nor has he been directly at-
tacked by any other candidate. His
record is spotless, unblemished.
Drafted Twice

For these reasons, I myself, as well
as many other Republican leaders,
feel that Governor Seranton would,
and possibly will be, the best can-
didate that the GOP could put up
in 1964, A few other facts will speak
well for the Governor. He has twice
before been drafted by the Republi-
can Party—once to run for Con-
gress in his home district, and once
to run for the Governorship of Penn-
sylvania. Both times he was run-
ning against heavy odds, for the
Republican Party started at a great
disadvantage vote-wise. Both times
he realized that the only chance the
Party had was to unify and support
one candidate, and both times he
was the man.

After being drafted, he did the
rest. Scranton is a politician’s poli-
tician. He is smart, shrewd, and
his sense of timing is amazing. The
latter is probably his biggest asset.
He wins elections on the campaign
trail, and although not many people
are familiar with him, Scranton
would make himself known to the
whole population of the U.S. in a

(Continued on page 4)

this coming July will have to be
known, both nationally and interna-
tionally. This is prerequisite and
Governor Scranton does not have
this. This along with his firm con-
viction not to run would rule him
out as a candidate for serious con-
sideration.

Mr. Lodge has shown support in
some small states, but this seems
more of a popularity vote than a
vote for a man who can do the job.
His job at present, as he calls it,
is as a servant of the people in Viet
Niem. It is doubtful that the sup-
port he will receive will be enough
of an impetus to bring him back
to the states.

Maine Senator-
GOP Surprise?

By GEORGE CRADDOCK

Senator Margaret Chase Smith is
waging an active and austere cam-
paign for the presidential nomina-
tion at the Republican Mock Con-
vention to be held here on May
4 and 5. This campaign is being run
without the aid of large financial
resources or the help of powerful
political organizations; rather em-
phasis is being placed on experi-
ence, on principles, and a sober and
direct approach. We believe that
the political convictions of the Sen-
ator are those held by the majority
of the people and the convention
delegates.

Senior Senator

Sen. Smith is the Senior Senator
from Maine, having served in the
highest legislative body since 1949
and congress since 1940. Significant-
ly, she has more national office ex-
perience than any other of the
announced or unannounced candi-
dates for the presidential nomina-
tion. She has termed herself a po-
litical moderate, looking neither to
the extremes of the right or left as
the future course for this country.
This middle of the road stand offers
the people a greater opportunity for
choice than either of the leading
candidates from the extreme ends of
the political picture can possibly of-
fer. Mrs. Smith has proven herself
to be a diligent, active, and success-
ful campaigner as seen in her sur-
prising show of strength in the IIli-
nois primary several weeks ago.

Surprises?

National Conventions are popu-
lar and famous for their surprises,
and no individual here is certain
of its outcome. One thing is cer-
tain, however, that the “Lady
from Maine” will be represented
here as a strong and able candi-
date, The Republican dark horse in
1964, therefore, may well prove to
be a filly,

right to bargain collectively. But his
position on labor-management is
conditioned by his concern for the
trade union member and his rights—
as opposed to those of the labor
bureaucracy.
Stand on Cuba

He fully supported the 1962 block-
ade against Cuba during the missile
crisis. Ever since then he has chal-
lenged the administration to con-
tinue the strong action that would
eliminate the Communist military
and subversion base just 90 miles
off our coast. He has charged, with-
out challenge, that the administra-
tion has failed to enforce restric-
tiens on shipping to Cuba.

Goldwater’s Prospects
Reports from state and national
Republican leaders show the con-
vention’s leaders that Goldwater
now has more votes than any other
GOP presidential hopeful, but no-
body knows if his lead is strong
enough to pull in the undecided
delegations.

Looking at the overall picture,
Durette, the Steering Committee’s
Republican Party Chairman, says he
thinks Goldwater “will have up-
wards of 400 votes on the first bal-
lott” at the Mock Convention.
Barry Goldwater stands for a
strong, solid fiscal policy and a
continually growing America—an
America under freedom and the
basic individual rights of each and
every American citizen. He is cer-
tainly no “extremist,” and he cer-
tainly can win in 1964—he is, in fact,
the only candidate that will offer
the American voter a choice.

Barry Goldwater not only can
win, but he will win. Because of
these reasons, and many others,
and, irregardless of California,
Barry Goldwater will win the
nomination of the Washington and
Lee Mock Convention for Presi-
dent on the second ballot.

 

Popular Support

In Primaries

Is Lodge Asset

By WALT BENNETT

In considering the candidacy of
Henry Cabot Lodge for the Re-
publican nomination for President
of the United States, there are sev-
eral things to bear in mind. First,
Mr. Lodge has proven his popular-
ity time after time in various pri-
maries without stating himself that
he is an official candidate for the
nomination. In the primaries in
which he has participated it has
been on a write-in basis and he has
still managed to receive a most im-
pressive showing. The foremost ex-
ample of this is of course his im-
pressive victory in New Hampshire
over other officially declared candi-
dates.

A second thing to consider in Mr.
Lodge's candidacy is the fact that
he has become a strong contender
for the nomination without an elab-
orate organization working for him.
This is adequate indication that
Mr. Lodge has the support of the
people themselves since the people
have largely taken the initiative
in his behalf. Mr. Lodge’s support
was not created by an organization
working on his behalf but comes
from a strong and widely spread
popularity among the voters them-
selves, the people,

A third factor in Mr. Lodge’s be-
half is that a good deal of his pop-
ularity comes from parts of the
country which are quite a distance
from his native New England. He
is not a sectional candidate. This
will undoubtedly be evidenced by
his almost certain victory in the
coming Oregon primary where Mr.
Lodge will again be a write-in can-
didate. In recent polls Mr. Lodge
has also shown strength in the Mid-
West and South, areas which until
recently had been considered almost
solidly for Senator Goldwater. Mr.
Lodge made a quite significant
showing in the primary in Mr.
Seranton’s home state, Pennsylvania.
Recent polls have also indicated
generally that Mr. Lodge is being
considered more and more seriously
by a rapidly increasing number of
people. His popularity as a candidate
has certainly increased more than
any other candidate while, indeed,
the popularity of some of them has
markedly declined.

It is for these reasons as well as
Mr. Lodge’s outstanding record of
service to his country that he must
be considered as a strong and like-
ly candidate for the Republican
nomination for President of the
United States. I urge you to weigh
these matters carefully and to sup-
port the best man, Henry Cabot
Lodge, for the Republican nomina-
tion,

 

 

 
 

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Stickmen to Face Toughest Yet;
Jayvees Outclassed by Virginia

By BRUCE GARRETT

The best W&L lacrosse team in
many a year faces a little bit better
team tomorrow.

Washington College of Maryland
is, according to W&L defense coach
Dana Swan, “head and _ shoulders
the best team we will have played
to date, including Williams.” Game
time is 3:15 on Wilson Field.

The Marylanders, who defeated
W&L last year 10-3, bring a 6-2
record into tomorrow’s game. Their
only loses to date have been to
Navy, 13-4, and to Johns Hopkins,
16-6. They have defeated UNC, 17-5,
New Hampshire, 22-4, Loyola, 15-2,
Hofstra, 8-6 (in the mud), Towson,
26-2, and Swarthmore, 15-4.

Last year Washington College was
ranked No. 13 in the country. W&L
was No. 38. Both teams have im-
proved their ratings this year.

Washington’s Fusting may be just
about the best attack man in the

country. He can, and does, play be-
hind the goal, on the creases, and
in the midfield.

Their midfielders, Dick, Rudolph,
and Weiss, who scored four goals
against W&L last year, are
a solid corps; and the Marylanders
are three deep at all positions.

The Washington defense is strong
and quick, and composed of good
stickhandlers. All the defensemen
can go either right or left with
the sick. Goalie Johnson can be
either fair or great depending on
the occasion. Against Navy he made
27 saves.

This will be Washington and Lee’s
first actual meeting with a fellow
member of the Southern (Strobahr)
Division, although North Carolina
and Duke are affiliated. Towson and
Loyola, whom we have yet to play,
are the other members of the league.

 

 

As the result of softball action
through Wednesday of this week,
two playoff positions have apparent-
ly been decided, while the races in
the other two leagues are still up
for grabs. All but certain of play-
off spots are Delt (4-0) and ZBT
(3-0.) Engaged in a three-way bat-
tle for one other playoff spot are
SPE (3-1), Beta (2-1), and Phi
Gam (2-1). Fighting for the last po-
sition are PiKA (3-0) and DU (2-0).

By virtue of two big victories in
the last week, the Delts took their
league’s title. First they whipped
Sigma Chi, 9-4, and then they de-
feated Lambda Chi, 5-0 behind the
shutout pitching of Fred Schaeffer.

The University of Virginia’s fresh- over KA.

men lacrosse team proved to be
quite a bit too much for the W&L
freshmen yesterday. The final score
in the game played here was 8-1
with the Generals on the short end.
It is the second setback for the
W&L freshmen in three starts.

The complete mixup which result-
ed in a three-way battle for third
place in the third league came about
when it was discovered that SPE
used an inelligible player in their
victory over Phi Gam. As a result,

INTRAMURAL WEEK

 

 
 

PERI

#3
the game was awarded to Phi Gam
on a forfeit. This left three teams
with a chance for first place...
SPE, Phi Gam, and Beta, who gained
a chance for the top spot with their
9-7 victory over Phi Delt. The cham-
pionship will be settled when SPE
meets the winner of yesterday’s
Phi Gam-Beta contest. SPE, who
earlier in the week downed Phi Delt,
21-2, rates as the probable favorite.

The mess in the four league de-
veloped when PiKA won_ two
straight in the last week to keep
a perfect record while DU didn’t
play. They first downed Pi Phi, 6-5,
and then they beat SAE by a forfeit.
DU was rained out in their only
game this week, against SAE. The
league’s championship will probably
be decided when DU and PiKA meet
in their already once postponed
game.

The week’s only other games saw
Sigma Chi pick up its second win
of the season, by forfeit, over Phi
Psi, and SAE take a forfeit victory

(Continued on page 4)

 

The game was close for a quarter.
The score at the end of the first
period was 1-1, but the Cavaliers
broke it wide open in the second
quarter with four goals.

The game’s leading scorer was
Billy Harrison of Virginia. He had
three goals. Cavalier goalie Stu
Orrick was also outstanding and
was credited with sixteen saves.

Fred Skinner got the only W&L
goals. Generals goalie Skip Brooks
made ten saves.

The varsity tennis team met de-
feat, 7-2, at the hands of the South-
ern Conference Champion, George
Washington, on Tuesday. Jim Mell
was the only victor for the Generals
in singles play, and he won in a
close hard fought three-set match.
Mell was also instrumental in gain-
ing the other win for W&L as he
and Forrest Dickinson combined
to win at number three doubles.

Jim DeYoung and Forrest Dickin-
son had very close matches in
a losing effort. DeYoung lost 6-2, 8-6,
to Harvey Harrison, last year’s
Southern Conference singles cham-
pion, and Dickinson carried his op-
ponent to 14-12 in the second set
before losing.

The Varsity played the Univer-
sity of Virginia yesterday at Char-
lottesville to close out their regular
season before the Conference tour-
nament next week. W&L carried
a 10-3 record into the match.

Next week, at the CAC tourna-

rival will be Washington.

Last year the golfers took second
in the tournament. This year they

W&L Takes
Dual Meet

The Washington and Lee track
team ran, swam and wallowed its
way to dual meet victories over
Elon (108-37) and High Point (99'2-
4514) in a triangular meet Tuesday.

The meet, scored as two dual
team’s game with RPI has been
for the season to 6-1. The triangu-
lar score was W&L 100%, High
Point 53, and Elon 26}.

In spite of rather unfavorable
conditions—the track was three inces
under water in places— the Generals
won 11 of the 17 events en route
to their largest point total of the
season. Several Generals ran “un-
officially” and would have added to
the total had they been official.

With the dual meet season com-
pleted, the trackmen have only the
state meet at Charlottesville and the
College Athletic Conference meet in
Danville, Ky., remaining on the
schedule.

Double winners for the victors
were Mike Goode who took the
high hurdles in 17.3, and the lows
in 27.8, Robin Kell who won the
high jump at 5’ 6” and the broad
jump at 21’ 34”, and Chris Kell
who won the 100 in 10.7, and the
220 in 23.3.

Other individual winners for the
Generals were Gay Gasque in the
shot, 45’ 8%”; Johnny Graham in
the pole vault, 11’ 6”; Scott Kennedy
in the javelin, 159’ 4”; and Rick
Hartgrove in the triple jump, 40’ 5”.
The 440 relay team was also vic-
trious in the time of 46.2.

Forty-seven men, a full varsity
and freshman team, will make the
trip to Charlottesville tomorrow for
the state meet. Coach Norm Lord
has high hopes of improving last
year’s fourth place finish.

IN THIS TIME of fading traditions,
we notice one more which seems
destined to oblivion.

You see it on the windows of
cars many times a day—three little
animals grouped in a festive mood.
They’re knokn as “Minks,” a nick-
name given to W&L students.

Century-old records referring
to us as “Minks” have been un-
covered, but no one is really sure
where this distinctive title origi-
nated.

One theory—after the notorious
“rat” of VMI became established as
the “most dispicable form of life
known to man,” it logically followed
that those on the adjoining campus

very short period of time. He is a
hard worker, and his past record
proves this.

Honest Assessment

As for an honest assessment of
the W&L Mock Convention, I am
not sure of his chances. I have
polled every state chairman, and it
appears to be a battle between
Nixon and Scranton on the later
(fourth, fifth, sixth) ballots. I would
have to give Nixon a slight edge.
I am confident, however, that he
will make a good showing at the
National convention in July. Scran-
ton movements are springing up all
over the country, and his backers
expect to send this drive into a high
gear in the next few weeks.

They are honestly working for a
draft now, and as has happened
twice before, I would not be the
least bit surprised if they do get
the draft for him. The convention’s
biggest disadvantage at this point
is that of being held at a date be-
fore the Scranton forces start to
really move. Of course the later date
of the California primary could also
be a crucial factor.

In summary, I feel that Scran-
ton’s chances at W&L are not quite
as good as I would like them to
be. I feel that he is a_ serious
candidate, and people should treat
him as such. I think also by July
that the draft will develop, and
that William Scranton will be
running against Johnson for the
Presidency.

and lost ground in the December
and April polls.

It is two full months until the
convention in San Francisco and
any thing can happen, but con-
sidering how things sound now
it seems to be a contest between
Goldwater and Nixon and if Gold-
water doesn’t win early, it looks
like Nixon is to run against John-
son next fall.

gebra and geometry problems. This
failure made her doubt her own
abilities and life in general.

In analyzing the dream part by
part, Dr. Baumann discovered that.
the patient was an introvert since |
her dream took place in her apart-
ment. An introvert was most at home
with herself, he explained.

When she walked over the moan-
ing body under the floor, she had to
leave the room because of her fear.
Dr. Bauman stated that the probing
dog represents the curiosity of the
patient since a person feels an in-
stinetive identification to a dog.

In solving the problem Dr. Bau-
mann stated that the patient re-
sisted the mathematical idea that
“a” equals “b.” She believed that
“a” could only equal “a” since “b”
was not the same as “a.” She tried
to force herself to understand these
identides that she did not under-
stand., and in the process she began
to doubt herself and life in general.
When the patient was told the rea-
son for her bad dream, she felt
much relieved.

servative Goldwater.

Finally, the Mock Convention of-
ficials point out that Goldwater's
plan to stay out of California dur-
ing the campaign, will prevent his
stopping these trends toward Rocke-
feller. If Goldwater does come to
California, Rockefeller will try to tie
the conservatives to his extremist
supporters in the state.

The Mock Convention’s prediction
that Rockefeller will stop Gold-
water in California is not the first
limb on which the Washington and

But they have been right eight out

To prove themselves above the

lowly title of “rats,” the W&L stu-
dents took the name of “Minks”
in the belief that the mink is the
aristocratic blue-blood of the ro-
dent family.
However, some VMI people came
up with another theory several years
ago. They claimed the mink is a
slippery, scheming creature which,
apparently harmless by day, stealth-
ily stalks its prey by night, at least
during midnight maneuvers on VMI
dance weekends.
Hence, they felt the title appro-
priately bestowed on those nasty
men who constantly “cherchez les

For Nixon, his only hope is
a compromise. This could be fatal
to the party. He has lost his sup-
port even in his home state. He
would never get the support of the

 

industrial states which are neces-
sary for anyone to win.

has been in from the beginning. He
has a fantastically faithful follow-
ing in some states. Quality is all
very fine, but again realistically it’s
the quantity that counts in the
end.

Rockefeller has this quantity. Just
looking at his campaigns one can see
the support that he has been get-
ting. Granted this has not all been
there from the beginning, but it’s
the end that counts. Rockefeller, by
convention time, will have the sup-
port that will enable him to get the
nomination. For as the weeks go by
the people see that here is a man
capable in all respects of beating
Johnson and leading this country as
| they _would like | to »_be Jed.
