Law School Wins One, Loses On Monday

ad as

Dudley elected
as president

by Lee Howard

For only the second time
since 1965, a law school student
has been elected president of
the student body.

Waller T. “‘Beau’”’ Dudley won
Monday’s Executive Commit-
tee presidential election, while
Biil Tucker was elected vice-
president.

Dudley won a surprising first
ballot victory by outpolling both
Jack Bovay, EC junior
representative, and J. Michael
Gallagher, Ring-tum Phi editor.
Dudley received 58 percent of
the votes cast in the largest
election turnout in recent
history. Almost 1,100 students
voted out of a student body of
about 1,700. That’s a turnout of
about 65 percent.

Dudley needed at least 50 per-
cent of the vote in order to avoid
a run-off. As it turned out, he
received 640 of the 1,092 votes
cast. Meanwhile, Bovay could
only manage 275 votes (25 per-
cent) and Gallagher 177 votes

(17 percent).

tivities Board chairman,

Law school
code changes

a mixed bag

by Randy Smith

Exercising prudence- and
discretion, the Executive Com-
mittee spent more than four
hours deliberating over the Stu-
dent Bar Association's propos-
ed changes to the honor system
Monday and Tuesday night.

The law school’s proposal for
a graduated penalty, giving the
EC an opportunity to allow a
convicted honor violator the op-
tion of reapplying, was defeated
by a narrow margin.

Approved was a proposal that
the pre-trial investigation of an
alleged honor violation be con-
ducted by two EC members and
a student.

The EC also retained the cur-
rent two-thirds vote conviction
instead of the recommended
three-quarters vote needed to
convict under the SBA’s pro-

posal.

garnered 54 percent of the votes
cast. Pete Williams, junior
class president, had the other 46
percent. Only 969 students voted
in the vice presidential election,
with Tucker receiving 527
ballots in his favor to 442 for
Williams.
ANALYSIS

Beau Dudley’s strength seem-
ed to be in the Red Square area
and at the law school, a strange
combination indeed. Dudley’s
strength in the Red Square was
not that surprising. As a former
Phi Kappa Sigma president, he
shares the conservative
political= attitude prevalent in

Davis, Huck win I.F.C. posts

Jim Davis and Rich Huck
stepped into the presidential
and vice-presidential positions
on the Interfraternity Council at
Tuesday’s I.F.C. meeting, of-
ficially ending the terms of
Steve Mattesky and Howdy
Knipp in those leadership roles.

Davis (Phi Kappa Sigma)
defeated Andy Fitzgerald (Phi
Kappa Psi) for the presidency,
336-260. Rich Huck (Beta Theta

Pi) edged out Doug Seitz (Phi
Gamma Delta) for the vice-
presidency by 49 votes in Mon-
day’s election.

Phi Kappa Sigma and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon led Monday’s
fraternity voter turnout in the
I.F.C. elections, both with over
50 members voting.

The new president called for
nominations and elections of
next year’s I.F.C. Judicial

Leon Helm and R.C.O.
All-Stars, Saturday

Two police officers, possibly
from the Sheriff's Department,
will be at Saturday’s concert
featuring Levon Helm and the
R.C.O All-Stars to avoid securi-
ty problems experienced at the
last Student Activities Board
concert, SAB chairman Bill
Tucker said at Monday’s Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting.

At the last SAB concert, the
Thursday before Fancy Dress,
sophomore Jesse Shaver was
hit over the head with an empty
beer bottle. The concert was
staged in the old gymnasium, a
building in which consumption
of alcholic beverages is pro-
hibited.

Tucker said it is difficult to
have students do security work

because students often let their
friends in with alcohol and

because students are not a sym-
bol of authority.

Police officers will have a
symbol of authority, but they
will not be allowed to search
students, Tucker said. He did
say, however, that officers
would have the right to deny en-
trance to students suspected of
concealing alcoholic beverages.

Although alcoholic beverages
will be prohibited, students will
still be treated to a good time,
Tucker said. He said Levon
Helm is an _ up-and-coming
group. He compared them with
the Allman Brothers Band
which came to W&L in the ear-
ly ‘70s just before it became a
popular group.

The leader of the group,
Levon Helm, is somewhat of an
innovator in the rock field. He

referendum
fails

by Lee Howard

An amendment which would
have given the law school a
third Executive Committee
representative failed passing
by only seven votes Monday
after the EC voted 7-4 not to ex-
tend voting on the amendment
to Wednesday.

The EC’s action effectively
killed the referendum as well as
any chance another referendum
has which have given the
freshman class two represen-
tatives. Both referenda were
approved by a majority of
students, but not by the two-
thirds majority required to pass
an amendment to the student
body constitution.

Students voted 656-338 (66 per-
cent) in favor of adding a third
year law representative. The
law school now only has an up-
per class representative and a
freshman representative.

New SCC procedures

‘Student Control Committee Chairman Jim McNider submitted a
list of six changes in SCC procedures designed to guarantee the
rights of all students at Monday’s Executive Committee meeting:

1. The accused will be informed of his rights, including his right

to remain silent.

2. The accused may have an advisor present during the Student

Control hearing.

3. The accused will be given a reasonable time to prepare a

defense.

4. The accused may be present during all testimony and may
question the witnesses. This does not apply to the preliminary hear-

ing.

5. The accused can look at all the physical evidence against him.
6. The accused will be notified by the Student Control Committee
as toexactly what the procedures it uses will be.

Pub Board split 3-2-2
on eight-page RtP

The Publications Board voted
3-2-2 last Mon. afternoon to
allow the Ring-tum Phi to have
two 12-page issues and two 8-
page issues for the rest of the
term.

Since the vote was taken, two
12-page Ring-tum Phis have
come out, meaning the final two
of the term will both be eight
pages.

The Board’s decision went
against a recommendation by
business manager Peter Goss
that the paper only contain
eight pages the rest of the year.
The Board recommended that
Goss return during the spring
term to reassess the paper’s
financial situation. At that time,
it was felt, Goss and the Board
would have a clearer picture as
to how the financial situation
was progressing.

Goss, in presenting his pro-
posal for an eight page paper
the rest of the year’ said at the
minimum that would leave $500
to cover any unexpected
charges the Ring-tum Phi
might incur over the rest of the
year. He said his estimate was
based on the lowest per week
cost of producing the paper and
on average per week advertis-
ing revenue. Goss said the
lowest possible cost to produce
an eight page paper, a figure he
admitted the Ring-tum Phi
news staff had hit for the
previous seven weeks, is about
$334. He said average advertis-
ing revenue per week is about
$311.

Managing editor of the Ring-
tum Phi Lee Howard used
Goss’s figures against him.
Noting that Goss’s list of
revenue was running about
$1,500 ahead of deficits, he ask-
ed how Goss could only predict
a $500 profit. Since only 10 more
issues of the paper are schedul-
ed to come out and since the dif-
ference between the cost of an
eight-page paper and average
advertising revenue is only $23,

Howard predicted the Ring-tum
Phi would make $1,270 under
Goss’s proposal.

Howard also used Goss’s
figures to back up his conten-
tion that even if the Ring-tum

 

Correction

Part of last week’s EC article
was not published due to a prin-
ting error. That part was:

Steve Abraham, sophomore
EC representative, introduced
a motion which would disallow
campaigning by ‘any can-
didate or his representative’
within 15 yards of the polling
area on the day of the election.

In addition, Abraham propos-
ed a motion designed to secure
the integrity of the election: ‘‘At
no time will a student attempt
to influence the vote of another
once a ballot has been received,
and the secrecy of one’s ballot
shall be maintained at all times
by those manning the polling
area.”

Both motions were passed by
the EC with the provisions that
the polling areas would never
be left unattended, and that
violations would be reported to
the Voting Regulation Board.

 

 

 

Phi went 12 pages the rest of the
year, it would net a profit. Goss
had said earlier that the cost to
produce a twelve page pager is
about $406, assuming the
minimum cost. Howard said
that, based on average adver-
tising revenue, that would mean
a 12 page paper would lose
about $95 per issue. With 10
issues remaining, Howard said
only $950 out fo the current
$1,500 surplus would be used up.
Thus, Howard said, ‘“‘simple
arithmetic’”’ shows that even
with continued 12-page papers
the Ring-tum Phi would net
about $550.

Goss disputed Howard’s con-
tention, saying that using the
average advertising revenue of
$311 is unrealistic because
advertising tends to drop off
during the last few weeks of
school. He predicted the
average advertising figure for
the rest of the term would be
about $300 per week. Goss also
said he was not sure production
costs could be kept to a
minimum. He added that cer-
tain unexpected expenses could
arise.

Ring-tum Phi editor Mike

_Gallagher said the record of his

staff over the past seven weeks
should be a good indication that
it will stay within the minimum
production cost schedule.
Howard later pointed out that
Goss’s lower advertising
prediction would mean a
change of only about $11@ in the

Ring-tum Phi’s profits. He said
the paper would, at a minimum,
make $440 even if it was a 12-
page paper the rest of the year.

Publications Board President
Ryland Owen said Goss should
not be questioned on his projec-
tions because he, as business
manager, is in the best position
to know the state of the
newspaper’s finances.

Grant Leister, Calyx business
manager, finally made a com-
promise proposal. He suggested
the Ring-tum Phi go eight pages
twice and 12 pages twice the
rest of the term. Gallagher,
Calyx Editor Temp Webber and
Leister voted for the proposal,
while Owen and Goss voted
against it. Ariel editor Parker
Potter and Publications Board
Treasurer Jeff Bird abstained.

After the vote, Gallagher urg-
ed the board to vote on whether
it is devoted to seeing that
publications make a profit or to
seeing that a quality paper
comes out every week. The
board did not feel compelled to
vote on the matter.

In other action, the board
voted unanimously to include a
journalism professor on the
board at all.times starting next
year. News Information Direc-
tor Bob Keefe made the pro-
posal, saying that as the Ring-
tum Phi becomes more ag-
gressive in its pursuit of news, a
professional advisor would be
worthwhile.

Young Democrats
are liberal

by Lee Howard

In a recent survey of the
members of the Washington
and Lee Young Democrats, 65
percent called themselves
either liberal or very liberal,
while only 16 percent said they
were conservative.

The survey was answered by
85 percent of the YD’s 87
members. No member called
himself very conservative,
while 19 percent of the
members said they are
moderate. Distinctions of

The Young Democrats will
hold elections the first week in
May for five club officers.

The officers are: President,
Vice President, Secretary,
Treasurer and Executive Direc-
tor. There will be a party on Fri-
day at 9 p.m. in the Good Tren-
cherman so that persons in-
terested in running for office

mined by putting a dot along a
left-right spectrum.

Despite the self-designated
liberal orientation of the club,
34 percent of the members said
they had become more conser-
vative since coming to W&L,
while only 18 percent said they
had become more liberal.
Forty-eight percent of the YDs
said they had not changed their
political outlook.

The Democrats’ survey also
included a survey of members’
attitudes toward several impor-
tant issues.

In themost nearly unanimous
vote on the questionnaire, 84
percent of YDs said they favor
legalized abortion. Only 11 per-
cent were opposed to abortion.
The emotionally-charged issue
had the leading amount of
undecided answers on the poll,
which only 5 percent expressing
no opinion.

Members were somewhat
less reluctant to favor federal
funding of abortion. Yet 67 per-
cent favored the idea, while on-
ly 20 percent opposed it.

The Equal Rights Amend-
ment, which the club had voted
to advocate to Virginia
representatives at a meeting lat

cant margin. Sixty-nine percent
said they favored the proposal
which is only a few states away
from ratification. Twenty-one
percent do not want the propos-

student affairs and for admis-
sions activities, will act as ad-
missions director until a new
director is named.

A 1949 Washington and Lee
graduate, Farrar joined the
staff in 1952 as assistant direc-
tor of admissions. When the late
Frank J. Gilliam retired as ad-
missions director in 1962, Far-
rar succeeded him in that post
and was, also named associate
dean of students.

Farrar said his new duties
will be a ‘“‘challenging change.
“T will be working in an area
that requires the kind of profes-
sional guidance and coordina-
tion to which I can bring my ex-
perience in admissions and my
knowledge of Washington and
Lee’s constituency.”

Noting his length of service in
the admissions directorship,
Farrar said his resignation
reflected his conclusion that
“the job is one that no one per-
son should hold indefinitely,
both because of the pressures it
entails and the need for new
perspectives in student recruit-
ment and selection.”

Huntley praised Farrar’s
“dedicated and skillful service”’
throughout the 16 years he was
admissions director. ‘‘Jim Far-
rar is one of Washington and
Lee’s great strengths and

26 years he has performed in-
valuable service to the universi-
ty, and I am gratified to know
that he will continue to do so in
the years to come.”’

In his new position, Farrar
will expand the use of alumni,
both as individuals and through
organized alumni chapters, in
attracting qualified students to
attend Washington and Lee. As
coordinator, Farrar will work
closely with Director of
Development Farris P. Hot-
chkiss and with Alumni
Secretary William C. Washburn
in drawing on ‘‘the enthusiasm
and energy of Washington and
Lee’s far-flung alumni,’ he
said.

“For years,’ Farrar com-
mented, ‘‘we have seen effec-
tive use made of alumni by
other colleges and universities.
While Washington and Lee has
been able to make only limited
efforts along these lines so far,
our experience clearly in-
dicates that we have a large un-
tapped source of help in our
alumni, if we can coordinate
and direct their efforts proper-
y.”

Huntley said Farrar is better
qualified to undertake that
challenge than anyone else he
knows of.

Trussell resigns as SMU head

cites conflicts with Dan Scott

Galen Trussell has resigned
as chairman of the Student
Music Union, citing the “‘straw
that broke the camel’s back”’ as
being Dan Scott’s ‘‘condescen-
ding” attitude when he told
Trussell he had the authority to
veto any act Trussell wanted to
book into the Cockpit.

Trussell said Cockpit night
manager Scott told him he
received the veto power from
Dean John, University Center
Director, Mike Cappeto and
treasurer James Whitehead.
According to Trussell, Scott
said he could veto any act
Trussell planned for the Cockpit
if he had already decided to pay
for an act out ofCockpit funds.

Trussell said his relations
with Scott have been worsening
throughout the year. He said he
resented a statement made by
Scott at last week’s Executive
Committee meeting to the ef-
fect that Trussell was not br-
inging enough entertainment in-
to the Cockpit. He said the
reason he had not was that the
EC had chastised him for
overspending his budget during

the fall term. He pictured
himself as being a man in the
middle; damned if the EC if he
got more entertainment and
damned by Scott if he didn’t.
Trussell saidhe had tried to
follow Scott’s advice during the
fall term, but had to exert more
of his own authority to keep ex-
penses down this term.
Worsening relations with

Scott was not the only reason

Trussell gave for resigning. He

said he has to leave for the spr-

ing term to do a journalism in-
ternship in Staunton. He also
said he has pressing time com-
mitments during the rest of this
term.

Trussell recommended two of
his hardest-working Music

Union members to succeed him.

He said Keith Leeper and Ken
Rose have both worked equally
hard and are good friends, so

      
   
        
    
        
   
 
    

   

they should be made co-
chairmen. Previously, Trussell
had been sole ‘iversity Center
Committee, a job thats main
function is to coordinate
musical entertainment in the
Cockpit through the Music
Union. Trussell said he sees the
fledgling SMU as more of a club
than a committee, although it
seems to have become a com-
mittee. He said the original in-
tent of the SMU was to get
students together who were in-
terested in or wanted to play
music. He said he would like to
see that idea expanded so that
the club could arrange to have
seminars with guest artists, or
have a forum to talk about
music, or even arrange a week-

ly jam.
Trussell added that he has
about $650 left in the

SMUbudget. He said he expects
the new co-chairman will re-
quest between 300 and 500 addi-
tional dollars to pay for a heavy
entertainment schedule in the
spring. And, Trussell says, he
expects they will get the addi-
tional money. He said he has
talked with at least four EC
members who indicated they
would support an additional
monetary request.

Next year’s SMU should re-
quest about $5,000 Trussell said.

The Washington and Lee
University chapter of Phi Beta
Kappa will induct 26 students
Monday (March 20) in Lee
Chapel.

Among the events planned for
the day to honor the inductees
are a lecture by David D. Bien,
a 1951 Washington and Lee
graduate who now teaches
history at the University of
Michigan, and a banquet in the

Phi Beta Kappa
induction Monday

With the additional $1,700 over
last year, the Union could put
an act in the Cockpit almost
every weekend in which there
were not some other major ac-
tivity going on, he said. And, he
added, the Cockpit could put
together whole weeks of enter-
tainment, as it has come close
to doing a couple of times this
year.

Trussell said that next year’s
SMU, seeing that it is funded
separately by the EC, should be
independent from the SAB,
Right now all expenditures
must go through the SAB
treasurer. He says the SMU,
since it will be dealing with so
much money and since its func-
tion is separate of the SAB,
should have its onw treasurer.

Trussell said there are only
two things he felt he was unable
to accomplish as head of the
SMU. He said he has been
unable to get boxes moved from
the dartboard area of the
Cockpit which makes it hard for
students to distinquish it from a
storage area. He said the Union
paid $55 for the dartboard and
he would like to sse it used.
Trussell added he has been
unable to convince Cockpit
manager Jerry Darrell to in-
stitute regular weekly happy

Concert for MS planned

Multiple Sclerosis cripples
and kills. It is a disease of the
central nervous system which
hardens brain or spinal cord
tissues or both. A good deal of
money is needed to support ef-
forts to develop a cure for MS
and Executive Committee
President Jim Underhill wants
the W&L community to lend a
hand, but not through tedious
fund-raising or personal dona-
tions. Rather, plans are to allow
students to benefit MS by atten-
ding an outdoor music festival
staging groups like the Charlie
Daniels Band, the Outlaws, and
Sea Level.

However, Jim says that
although the organizational
steps have fallen into place with
an unusual amount of ease,
nothing can be done. Why?
Because it takes money to make
money and in this case, thirty
thousand dollars. in front meney

is needed to finance the affair.
So far, an investor has not been
found. According to Jim, if an
investor is found, he stands not
only to gain a monetary profit of
some amount, but to benefit the
MS cause and Washington and
Lee’s image as well.

Underhill and Washington
and Lee student Kirby Tom-
pkins have contacted the bands,
and they expressed a definite
interest in performing.
However, the bands also ex-
pressed that they will not play
free of charge. They will con-
sider playing at a cost below
normal outdoor concerts.

The location planned for the
event is ‘““Expoland,’’ an amuse-
ment and recreational facility
at the junction of Interstates 81
and 64. Jim assessed the loca-
tion as being more than ade-
quate due to its accessability,

spacious parking .area, toilet ;

facilities, and available stage
equipment.

Underhill also expressed con-
fidence that the concert would
do more than simply break
even. He attributes his op-
timism to the letters of endorse-
ment he has received from the
national MS officials, in par-
ticular, a letter form the sports
director of the organization,
Ara Parseghian. Also, twenty
area colleges and universities
including Virginia Tech and the
University of Virginia at Arl-
ington. Jim believes that pro-
motion can easily be obtained,
without charge, due to the
nature of the event.

The appeal of an outdoor con-
cert is surefire. The organiza-
tion is solid and the cause pro-
mises benefits to all involved.
But, unless an independent in-
vestor is found, the project will

“Red Square Machine“

effective for Dudley

(continued from page 1)
those fraternities. In fact there
was a report of a ‘‘Red Square
Machine’ which got the vote
out for Dudley.

Dudley’s victory at the law
school was a bit more surpris-
ing. He received about two-
thirds of the votes cast in Lewis
Hall. Although Dudley is a law
student, he hardly represents
the generally liberal political
views over at the law school.
And his waffling on the issue of
having a third law school re-
presentative, first announcing
he disagreed with the proposal
then coming out in favor of it
would seem to have placed
him in a vulnerable position.
But, as one law student put it,
“Law students vote for their
own kind.’’ While
undergraduates didn’t seem to
view the election as a law school
versus undergraduate battle,
the denizens of Lewis Halli
would seem to have.

Gallagher, who seemed to
represent law school viewpoints
more closcly than Dudley,
received most of the rest of the
law school votes. But he did
most of his campaigning in the

law school, while Dudley spent /

most of his time in
undergraduate strongholds
such as the freshman dor-
mitories. One major difference
between Gallagher and Dudley,
however, is that Dudley focused
on uncontroversial issues such
as decreasing the use of
Doremus Gymnasium by local
high schools and_ doing
something about the noise or-
dinance violation. Gallagher in

the meantime was forced to de-
fend his controversial stances
on open meetings and students’
rights. Gallagher was also seen
as a threat to the fraternity
system because of his paper’s
attacks on khaki culture and
certain fraternities. It was
generally agreed Gallagher had
made too many enemies to win
the election.

Bovay, in the meantime,
seemed to be the middle-of-the-
road candidate, usually an en-
viable position. But Bovay did
not seem to wage an aggressive
campaign, relying on his ex-
perience with the EC to be a
compelling reason to vote for
him. Because Bovay did not
seem to be receptive to changes
the law school has been ad-
vocating, he only received 10
votes from Lewis Hall. But
Dudley outpolled him on the
main campus, too.

Some observers thought
Bovay’s defeat was a referen-
dum on changes the EC has
made this year, much as
Gallagher’s was a referendum
on the editorial position of the
Ring-tum Phi. If that is the
case, one law student said,
“The EC is going back to the
dark ages.” That is yet to be
seen, but Dudley is undoubtedly
concerned with maintaining
certain cherished W&L tradi-
tions, among them being the
fraternity system and an all-
male undergraduate body. He
does, however’ favor some of
the law school honor changes.

SAB announces Movie
Program for Spring Term

by M. Gray Coleman

This year the SAB struck
gold...For many years, the
Movie Subcommittee presented
many good films to the student
body; but, the turnout from the
students often left something to
be expected, and the Board
seemed to have resigned itself
never to turn a profit in this
area. That is until now. The cur-
rent Board members decided to
take a gamble — consistently
high-quality movies were to
come to W&L, at a greater cost
than ever before. They hoped to
break even, due to the greater
“name appeal” of the presenta-
tions.

They were all in for a sur-
prise; suddenly, the Movie Sub-
committee was rolling in
surplus cash!...Attendance at
all films has reached a record
high, people even sitting in the
aisles for recent showing of The
Omen. Evidently, there was a
lot of discussion about what to
do about the windfall. The end
result — a happy one — was a
decision to put the money back
into a top-quality movie
package for the Spring Term,
which has recently been finaliz-
ed.

The SAB will be presenting
movies four nights a week dur-
ing the term; Friday through
Sunday, there will be $1 films in
duPont Hall, and then on
Thursdays, free movies in the
Cockpit. The schedule for the
Cockpit is as follows: The Spy
Who Came in From the Cold
(April 20), The Apprenticeship
of Duddy Kravitz (April 27),
The Odd Couple (May 4), Laura
(May 11), and Italian Job (May
18).

In their choice of these films,
the Board showed a decided
preference for relatively cur-
rent boxoffice successes;
however, there is one great ex-
ception in Otto Preminger’s
Laura of 1944. This film was one
in a long string of very suc-
cessful forties thrillers, started
with The Maltese Falcon. The
tightly woven plot involves a
poor, but honest cop who in-
vestigates a murder in high
society (of course, the victim is
Laura herself). As he in-
vestigates the gruesome crime,
he becomes entranced with the
portrait of Laura... and when
the supposed victim inex-
plicably returns to her apart-
ment, the search is on — not on-
ly for ‘‘who did it’’ but ‘‘who did
they do it to?” (for there is still
the annoying problem of that

unnamed corpse...)

Meanwhile (under the big top,
as it were), four favorites will
be playing in duPont. They are:

Marathon Man (April 21-23),
Islands in the Stream (April
28-20), Gone With the Wind
(May 5-7), and The Shootist
(May 12-14). The latter two
shows will have only oen per-
formance per night, at 7 p.m...

Of all the films in this spring’s
line-up, probably none is an
eagerly awaited as that version
of Margaret Mitchell’s “great
American novel,’’ which swept
the Oscars of 1939. Not that it
didn’t have stiff competition;
that year is generally regarded
as the greatest the industry
ever had, presenting among
others — Stagecoach (with John
Wayne in his first big hit),
Disney’s Pinocchio, The Grapes
of Wrath, Dark Victory with
Bette Davis, Goodbye Mr.
chips...and the greatest film
fantasy of all time, The Wizard
of Oz.

Few movies have become
such cult attractions; every
line, every frame of Gone With
the Wind has been a cherished
possession to millions, since its
premiere at the _ recently-
demolished Loew’s Grand in
Atlanta. The film took some
three years to put together, and
was in filming for a year. Of
course, most of the early work
was wrapped up in the famous
“‘search for Scarlett’? — over
1,400 women were interviewed.
Out of these, some 90 got screen
tests Everyone from Lana
Turner to Paulette Goddard,
who was almost signed for the
role when Vivien Leigh arrived
on the set on the night Atlanta
was burned. And the search
came toa sudden, happy halt.

Shown all-too-rarely on col-
lege campuses due to its length,
Gone With the Wind was the big-
gest box office success since
Griffith’s Birth of a Nation, 25
years before. And it was to hold
that position for 25 more...It is
the crowning achievement of
1930’s Hollywood, the model for
MGM prestige, and the greatest
day for that long-extinct
creature, the Hollywood
character actor. We may still
have the stars, but the likes of
Prissy and Big Sam, Belle Watl-
ing and the evil Jonas Wilker-
son will probably never be seen
again...So catch this movie — in
fact, catch as many as possible.

And, as for the SAB, they
couldn’t be happier —it is too be

hoped that their gamble will
continue to pay off. “The only
thing we have to worry about is
what to do when the good
movies run out.’’ Luckily, the
chances are doubtful...

One other announcement —
speaking of gamblers, one sure
thing that the SAB will repeat is
that annual zoo, the Spring Porn
Flick... By popular request, this
year’s biggie will be The Devil
in Miss Jones. Two shows will
be held every night after The
Shootist in duPont (May 12-14)
at 9 and 10:30 p.m., for another
charge of one dollar...

The Ritz: Modern Comedy to
Open in Boiler Room

by M. Gray Coleman

In its philosophy, the Univer-
sity Theatre often stresses that
it is, above all, a teaching facili-
ty. Its primary objective, in
view of this, is to present as
many theatrical styles and
works of different authors and
periods as possible — and all in
a brief four years. Priorities
must be set, whether
Shakespeare or O’Neill or
Albee. And, generally, they
manage to present a season
greatly appealing, if only for its
diversity.

Unfortunately, there is one
great problem to face. Granted,
the UT is a teaching facility, but
what good is any play in front of
an audience of ten? Let’s face
it — most of us don’t want to be
morally edified in the Boiler
Room, or thrown into fits of
depression in the Troubadour
over the “human condition.”
Comedy and musical — that’s
sure boxoffice appeal. .

So, how do you reconcile what
the students should learn, and
what the audience wants to
see? About the best that can be
done, is, again, to balance. And
so, the fourth major production
this year is (low and behold!) a
contemporary American com-
edy, The Ritz by Terrence
McNally. It is to be directed by
senior Barry Godin as his thesis
project, with the assistance of
stage manager Phil Heldrich. |

The Ritz was first presented

March 19, at 7:30 p.m.

 

at the Yale Reperatory Theatre
in 1974; moving to the Longaire
Theatre on Broadway in 1975, it
was a rapid success, running
for 15 months. Among its many
honors were three Tony
Awards, including Rita Moreno
as the Best Actress in a Com-
edy.

The story is fast-paced, and
may be outlined as follows, the
head of a New York Mafia
“family” dies; his dying words,
“Get Proclo,”’ put out a death
contract on his bumbling son-in-
law, Gaetano Proclo (played by
Warren Mowry). Proclo, flee-
ing for his life, tells a cab driver
to take him ‘“‘to the last place in
New York where I could be
found,” and ends up at The Ritz,
a gay bath-house.

There, the befuddled man
from Cleveland meets a galaxy
of characters — from Chris
(David Sorrells), the life-of-the-
party type, who is overjoyed to
find out that heterosexuals are
often as victimized as the
patrons of The Ritz; to Claude
(Larry Loveridge), the “‘chub-
by chaser’’ who tries to pin Pro-
clo down, only to remember
him as an old Army buddy; to
the outrageous Googie Gomez
(Anne Secor of Sweet Briar), a
down-and-out-singer who works
in The Ritz’s disco. Googie is
forever intent on finding ‘‘Mr.
Big,”’ the great producer who
will take her away. Determined
to see Proclo in this role, she
becomes, '_ increasingly
frustrated — he thinks she’s an
insistant transvestite...

Things really take off as Pro-
clo’s brother-in-law, Carmine
(Bill Matthi) arrives, intent
upon the contract — followed by
Proclo’s wife Vivian (Lola
Vialani). And the chase is on...
everybody determined to ‘get
Proclo.”’ Vivian wants to get
him home; Carmine would
prefer the bottom of the East
River; Claude just wants to roll
on a fat man; and Googie wants
him to catch her act (as she
says, “We save the hanky-
panky stuff for later, chico...) It
all results in a highly comic
finish, as The Ritz survives its

 

 

heterosexual invasion...but only
barely.

The set, designed by Tom
Ziegler and Ellen Jervey, adds
a lot to the show’s effectiveness.
The illusion is one of endless
hallways with small rooms —
one character calls it a
““Chinese maze.”’ In fact, a ma-
jor point to notice is that
characteristic of endless
wandering which the various
patrons assume. The rooms of
Proclo, Carmine, Claude, and
Michael Brick, the detective
(Rich Allen), are suggested
through open walis. Ramps,
and even overhead platforms,
result in the literal use of the en-
tire Boiler Room by Ziegler and
Jervey.

In speaking to director Godin,
many points about the show and
its particular challenges.
“Above all, we have to realize
that timing means so much in
comedy’ and a crisp tempo is
all-important,” he said. “This
show involves more physical
movement (i.e., chase scenes,

* people hiding under various

beds) than any other show this
year. So we had to ask a lot of
the actors, but they have
delivered quite well. Above all,
The Ritz is not only one of the
funniest comdeies of errors in
recent years, it is also well-
written. And it is a good test
play for a thesis — in terms of
diction, management of a large
cast, and pace.”

The play will run next Mon-
day through Saturday, March
20-25, at 8 p.m. in the Boiler
Room Theatre. Reservations
are necessary, and free tickets
for W&L people can be obtained
at 463-9111, ext. 371 during the
day.

In the end, The Ritz ’means’”’
nothing; the stress here is pure
enjoyment and laughter. There
‘'S no social statement to be
ade, except that people, with
a'l their strange ways (whether
Mafia don or bath-house
fatron), can still be amusing
and strangely endearing.

The Goodbye Girl:

A Good Movie is hard to find

by Robert Boardman Tremblay

With every passing year not
only in Hollywood turning out
fewer pictures, it is turning out
fewer quality pictures as well.
When one considers that The
Towering Inferno, a vintage

bore, was nominated ‘for Best :

Picture in 1974, the situation
since the golden '30’s has ob-
viously worsened. With condi-
tions as they are right now, it
would be imperative for the
serious moviegoer not to miss
any good pictures that come to
town for following right after
them might be ten colossal
bombs, such as Saturday Night
Fever or a Walt Disney sleeper.
That’s why it’s a must to get
your two dollars out and go see
The Goodbye Girl at the Lyric.
This is truly an excellent film,
one of the few really fine movies
of the year.

Though the story is hardly
original, it is still retold with
some refreshing twists. The
story concerns two people
(Eliot Garfield and Paula

; McFadden) who at first loathe
each other but at the end fall in
love. He is a struggling actor
from Chicago, she is an ex-
dancer who’s just received a
Dear Jane letter and whose ex-

boyfriend has kindly sublet the
apartment to Garfield. Of
course, Paula is not too keen on
Garfield moving in, but since
the apartment is his, there’s not
much she can do. Garfield is
kind enough to allow her and
her daughter to stay, however.
An old story for sure, but what
gives this picture such power is
the superb acting of Richard
Dreyfuss (Garfield), Marsha
Mason (Paula), and Quinn
Cummings as Lucy, Paula’s
daughter. This trio is
marvelous throughout and the
script from a play by Neil
Simon, Mason’s husband, is
priceless as well. Comedy,
sadness and poignancy are all
rendered brilliantly here, it’s no
wonder this picture is
nominated for five Academy
Awards.

Of course, one scene in this
film is worth the price of admis-
sion itself. This is the scene
where Dreyfuss has to play
Shakespeare’s Richard III as
an outright homosexual.
Dreyfuss’ interpretation of this
character is nothing short of
hysterical. Imagine Truman
Capote shouting, ‘‘A horse, a
horse, my kingdom for a horse’
and you have the basic idea.

Mason herself is sterling as
the goodbye girl which is sup-
posedly a story of her romance
with Simon in the first place.
The other bright spark in this
film, is, of course, Quinn Cum-
mings, the child star, following
in the footsteps of Tatum
O’Neal, is also up for an
Academy Award in her first
film. Quinn as Lucy is a child
beyond her years and her
language and quick mind prove
it, but she is more convincing as
a sensitive, depandent child
than Tatum O’Neal, who was
the one who ran the show in
Paper Moon.

The Goodbye Girl is obviously
one of those movies that should
not be missed, it has that rare
combination today of a good
story, great acting, and tight
directing as well. Dreyfuss, an
actor of amazing versatility and
ability, (his former films in-
clude American Graffiti, Jaws,
and Close Encounters of the
Third Kind) could easily win
Best Actor for his performance
in this movie and it’s easy to see
why. He really steals the show.
The Goodbye Girl is indeed a
movie that deserves a look. In
today’s era of cultural decline,
good movies are a hard find.

As announced in last week’s
Ring-tum Phi,Levon Helm and
the RCO All-Stars, along with
special guest Livingston
Taylor, will appear at W&L’s
own Warner Center this Satur-
day at 8:30 PM. While their
names may not be immediately
familiar, a brief history of some
of the band me ers may refresh
your memory.

Levon Helm himself is pro-
bably the best-known member
of the group, having served as
drummer and vocalist for The
Band. The Band, of course,
played with Bob Dylan for a
while, and had several hits of
their own, most notably ‘‘Up On
Cripple Creek.’’ Helm sees his
duties in his current group as
simply ‘‘to sing on key and not
give up any slack on the time or
feel.”

Chicago-born Paul Butter-
field, world-renowned _har-
monica player, is best known
for his work with the Paul But-
terfield Blues Band. He ap-
peared on the original
Woodstock album, and infact,
currently resides in Woodstock,
New York.

Booker T. Jones (Booker T.
and the MG’s) plays organ for
the RCO All-Stars. He feels that
the band represents ‘“‘a con-
sortium of musical styles and
backgrounds drawn from each
of the players who were raised
up and down the Mississippi
River.”

The SAB has (at least tem-
porarily) moved away from the
Bill Deal-Shirelles syndrome,
and has decided to provide the
W&L community with some
high-quality musical entertain-
ment. You can expect a good
show by what is definitely a
band to watch for on the
musical scene.

THE

RING-TUM PHI

 

Baseball season starts,
first home game Sat.

With only two seniors on the
team, the 1978 baseball
Generals appear headed for a
challenging season this spring.
Coach Joe Lyles, now in his 19th
season as head baseball coach
at W&L, points to the lack of
proven depth and inexperience
as the current weaknesses on
the ‘78 Generals.

Lyles expresses optimism
however, in regards to the up-
coming season, “We feel we
have tremendous jump on our
opposition despite the fact that
the weather has limited our out-
door practice. The combination
of our successful fall program,
a winter weight training pro-
gram, and our spirited indoor
practice that began in January
should all work in our favor.

‘Two main factors will effect
our won-loss record in 1978,”
says Lyles, ‘‘Pitching and
defense, and hitting. Those are
always 99 percent of the game.”’
W&L will again compete for the
ODAC baseball crown with
defending champion Lynchburg
and always tough Randolph-
Macon listed as the pre-season
favorites. Bridgewater,
Eastern Mennonite, Emory &
Henry, and Hampden-Sydney
will also compete in conference
paly. Each ODAC school palys
two games against every other
conference member.

The W&L pitching staff will
be composed of all
righthanders. Sophomore Chip
Childs (1-7, 3.72 ERA in 1977)
will be the stopper on the staff
along with sophomore Vic
Shepherd (1-4, 5.08 ERA in
1977). Also on the staff are
sophomore By Steele (0-5, 5.40
ERA in 1977), junior Bruce
Williams, and freshman Scott
Stafford.

Catcher Maynard McCorkle,
a three year starter, has been
lost to graduation, but
sophomore lettermen Kevin
Moynahan (.222) returns with
great promise. Freshmen Dan

Kingman and Tom Coates will
fight Moynaham for the job.

Junior Mike Busbey (.271) led
the 1977 regulars in hitting and
returns at first base. Busby
will be backed up by sophomore
Guy Steuart (.333 in eight
games). Three candidates are
competing for graduated Ben
Bonaventura’s second base spot
including sophomore John
Stagmaier (.174), and freshman
Doug Hassinger, the outstan-
ding first year player in 1977 fall
baseball. Andy Schutrump, a
sophomore who did not make
the team last year, came back
strong this spring and could sur-
prise.

Senior co-captain Ted Hissey
(2.16) is anchoring third base
after playing shortshop for the
previous three years.
Sophomore Pete Restanio (.150)
looks like the leading prospect
to nail down the vacant opening
at short.

Four players have looked pro-
mising in the outfield including
junior co-captain and starting
conterfielder Rich Wiles (.237).
Junior Chuck D’Auria (.161) is
the incumbent in right field with
senior Bob Szezcinski
(.208) and sophomore Dan
Swagert (2.38) fighting it out for
the right field opening.
Szczecinski and Dan Kingman
could alternate at designated
hitter depending on the pitcher.

The 1978 team’s strengths ap-
pear to be at first base and the
outfield. The early season
games will hopefully give need-
ed experience to the young
Generals who could play the
role of the spoiler in the °78
ODAC race.

Weather permitting, the
season opens on Wednesday,
March 15th with an ODAC
doubleheader at Hampden-
Sydney. The team is home on
Smith Field for a conference
doubleheader against Eastern
Mennonite on Saturday, March
18th . -

has busy schedule ahead

“‘We improved a great deal in
the Mt. Washington game as
compared to the Duke game,”’
said head W&L coach Jack Em-
mer, ‘‘The team put forth a
good effort and it paid off as we
played Mt. Wasington to the
limit.”” The Generals led 54
with 4:52 to play in the third
quarter before succumbing 8-6
to the Wolfpack. The game is
only an exhibition and does not
count in the team’s overall
record or individual statistics.

This was the eleventh
meeting between the two teams
with defending club champion
Mt. Washington winning all
eleven. It was a close contest
throughout as W&L led 2-1 after
one period with the score tied
4-4 at the half and 5-5 after three
quarters. Mt. Washington pull-
ed away to an 8-5 lead with 8:27
to play and held on for the win.

A balanced scoring effort
kept the Generals in the game

as six different players scored
including one gaol each by at-
tackmen John Black, Jeff Fritz
and Jay Foster. Middies Sandy
McDonald, Roman Kupecky
and John Kemp also tallied for
W&L. Mt. Washington was led
by John Cheek with two goals.
Goalies Bob Clements and
Charlie Brown split time in the
net with Clements making five
saves and Brown 13. Each
allowed 4 goals.

Mt. Washington outshot the
Generals 47-34, and W&L
cleared 27 of 47 while the
Wolfpack was 17 of 31. Mt.
Washington won 11 of 20
faceoffs with the best individual
faceoff effort by W&L coming
from John Hooper who won
seven of eleven.

Emmer and assistant coach
Chuck O’Connell had to be

pleased by the improvement in -

the week since the Duke game.
“The Duke game’s a thing of

   

After a slow start, the lacrosse team will meet Ohio State Monday
at3 p.m. on Wilson Field. Go out and support the Generals!

 

Outdoor season starts

 

the past, it’s all over,” said Em-
mer, “If we played again, we
wouldn’t do anything different.
Conbining the inclement pre-
season weather with our young
and inexperienced team at this
point in the year proved too
much to overcome.”’

The Generals are idle this
week but face four games in ten
days beginning with the home
opener against Ohio State on
March 20th. Game time is 3:00
p.m. on Wilson Field. Following
the Buckeye contest, W&L
hosts perennial college division
power Towson State on March
22nd, at 3:00 p.m., up and com-
ing North Carolina on Marcb
25th at 2:00 p.m., and Virginia
Tech next Wednesday, March
29th at 3:00 p.m.

“We're pointing towards the
week we play Ohio State,
Towson and UNC,” notes the
coach, ‘‘It’s obviously one of our
biggest weeks of the season.
We’re hoping to have each of
our midfields firm by that point
and will expect to have
everybody in the right place at
the right time.”

In W&L’s first two games this
year, Charlie Stieff, Geoff Brent
and George Santos have been
running on the blue midfield,
with Jay Sindler (Player of the
Game vs. Duke), Sandy
McDonald and John Kemp play-

Golfers compete today
in first match of season

Coach Buck Leslie’s golfers,
the nation’s seventh ranked
Division III team in 1977 open
the 1978 season this Thursday
playing Longwood College in
Lexington. The 1977 golfers
finished at 10-1 overall, and in
Leslie’s three years as head
coach have won 34 of 39 mat-
ches.

W&L will again compete for
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference championship, a title
they won in 1977. Bridgewater,

Emory & Henry, Hampden-
Sydney, Lynchburg, Randolph-
Macon and Roanoke will also
compete in conference play.
Medalists play will govern all
ODAC matches with the best
five of six scores counting for
team totals. Leslie was 1977
ODAC Coach of the Year.

Senior captain Jerry Maat-
man (Wilmette, Ill.) returns to
lead the 1978 team. He was an
All-Amercian last season,
W&L’s first ever in golf, when

he finished fifth individually in
the Division III nationals.
Junior Dave Leunig (Louisville,
Ky.) will join Maatman giving
W&L perhaps the best twosome
in the conference. Leunig
was named the ODAC’s Golfer
of the Year in 1977 when he won
the ODAC Tournament with a 36
hole total of 148.

tories for its efforts. W&L was
in this enviable position after
last Friday’s victories over host
Roanoke College and Liberty
Baptist College. W&L outdoor
track, therefore, enters its se-
cond meet of the year Saturday
against Davidson at VMI with a
2-0 record. How long W&L stays
undefeated remains to be seen.

W&L piled up points in both
the track and the field events.
Tri-captain Phil Dunley led the
weightmen with victories in the
shot put and the discus. Paul
Hendry cleared 510” to win the
high jump, and Baker Spring
took second overall in the pole
vault. Due to wet conditions, the
javelin, long jump, and triple
jump events were not com-
peted.

In the track events, W&L
took first in 6 of the ten races.
Tri-captain Jack Norberg and
sophomore Stu Atkinson each
ran identical times to win the
100 meter dash (the only event

run in meters Friday). Norberg
also took the 220 in 22.9 and
placed second overall in the 440
with a 53.0 clocking. Bill Morris
won the 880 yard run, and Chris
Daniels placed second in the
mile. Senior Al Weeks won the
2-mile, coming within 30
seconds of setting a new school
record at that distance. Tri-
captain Norvall Scott was se-
cond overall in the 440 in-
termediate hurdles, and
freshman Jim Vines was second
overall in the 120 high hurdles.
In addition to these solo
achievements, W&L won both
the 440 yard and mile relays.

This Saturday’s meet is
against a Davidson team which
W&L upset last year. This year
W&L will try to repeat that
result. Anyone who is bored
enough Saturday to try
something new could come and
watch the meet, which begins at
11:00 A.M.
Track team goes outside

by Jim Parker

Following a third place finish
in the ODAC indoor track cham-
pionships during Fancy Dress
Weekend, the W&L track team
has been preparing for the up-
coming outdoor track season.

Head track coach Norris
Aldridge admits the team is
young, but has the potential for
a fine season. Coach a
says a lot depends on how the
freshmen and first-time run-
ners and field men (over ten of
them) perform. Aldridge does
look for improvement over the
indoor season.

The culmination of the indoor
track season, the ODAC indoor
track championship at Lyn-
chburg College was, in the
words of Coach Aldridge, disap-
pointing (W&L finished 3rd,
over 40 points behind Lyn-
chburg). However, Aldridge
notes that the team was coming
off February vacation and had
to run the meet on the Saturday
of physically draining Fancy
Dress Weekend. Aldridge ex-
pects the track team to far bet-
ter when the ODAC outdoor
championship occurs in late
April.’

The outdoor track team will
be captained by a runner, a
jumper (primarily), and a
weight man. Jack Norberg, who
is known for being notoriously
late for practice, but also known

fille, Va.) will join Maatman
and Leunig giving W&L a very
solid top four. Last year’s
freshman sensation, Gerry
Barousse is no longer on the
team, and the final two spots
are up for grabs. Seniors Bo
Moorhead (Denver, Colo.) and
Jim Walter (Montgomery,
Ala.) look like the leading can-
didates along with freshmen
Charles Haldi, Bill Hutton,
Kevin McGuire, Bill
Neuenschwander, and Jim
Taylor. Sophomore Tom Wall is
also in the running. Coach
Leslie has been handicapped in
the judging of his men due to the
lack of outside playing time.

The Generals will have more
tourney play in 1978 than usual
competing in the James
Madison Classic on March
25-26, theWilliam & Mary
Classic on April 17-18, and the
ODAC Tournament on April
24th in Staunton. For the first
time, W&L will also field a “‘B”
team this spring which will give
some of the younger players
needed collegiate playing ex-
perience.

for losing his lunch more often
than losing races, leads the run-

ners. Norwall ‘‘(OCAC)”’ Soctt,
who has come within inches of
breaking the school record in
the long jump, is the premier
jumper. Phil Dunley, who won

the shot put at the ODAC’s in-
doors on his final throw, heads
the weightmen. However, these
three captains do not comprise
the total skill of the team.
Especially in the distance runn-
ing events, coached by ex-W&L
runner Stu Nibley, there are
members of the team who are of
the tri-captain caliber.

Coach Aldridge believes the

strongest events for W&L will
be the 440 yard dash, the half-
mile (880 yards), the mile and
the 3-mile, and the long and tri-
ple jump. The 440 relay and
mile relay teams should also be
strong, Aldridge said. The top
runners in the 440 will be
Norberg and Herny Hairston.
Pacing the 880 will be freshman
Bill Morris and Chris Daniel.
The mile should be headed by
Daniel, Rich Bryd and Bob
Bates (Bryd, Daniel, Morris,
and Bill Welch set an ODAC 2-
mile relay record this year in-
doors). The top 3-milers will be
Al Weeks, Johnny Plowden and
Brian Adams. The premier
sprinters (100 yard c and 220
yard dashes) appears to be
Norberg, Stu Atkinson, and
freshman Chris Leiser.
Freshman Jim Vines is the 120
high hurdler and Vines and
Scott will run the 330 in-
termediate hurdles. In most
every event, there are per-
formers who are as talented or
nearly as talented as_ the
aforementioned group.

The same is true in the jump-
ing and weight events.
However, the premier jumpers
will be Scott in the long jump
and Bobby Hoffman in the triple
jump. The top pole vaulters ap-
pear to be Baker Spring and
Bob Campbell, while the best
high jumpers now are Paul
Hendry (who jumped 14’ last
year) and Dave Sheridan. The
shot had ODAC champ Dunley
and Tony Cucci, and Dunley
and Chip Nunley guide the
discus men. The javelin
throwers, who, of course,
couldn’t compete indoors, are
balanced, with two football
players, Jeff Slatcoff and Scott
Swope, and one freshman, John
Schmidt, among their numbers.

Coach Aldridge sees a close
ODAC championship meetout-
doors this year. Last year, the
top 3 teams were separated by
only 15 points. This year could
be as compacted at the top as
last year.

Self-Study report:
Internal Re-examination

Washington and Lee has com-
pleted its preliminary Self-
Study report — a joint effort
that involved participation over
the. past eight years from
students, the faculty, the ad-
ministration and the board of
trustees, leading to a 310-page
analysis, just published, with
117 separate recommendations
for action or continued in-
vestigation.

A ‘“‘self-study” is required
once a decade by the Southern
Association of Colleges and
Schools, the agency which ac-
credits colleges in the region.
The 1978 Self-Study Report was
prepared by Frank A. Parsons,
assistant to the president, with
the cooperation of the entire
university community. Parsons
was the editor of the 1964-66
Self-Study also.

In large measure, according
to Parsons, the 1978 Self-Study
at W&L is the result of the con-
tinuing evaluation of the univer-
sity’s goals and programs that
has occurred over the past
decade in connection with the
‘Development Program for the
Decade of the 1970s.”’

Among the principal
elements of the
new Self-Study are the re-
evaluation of the W&L
undergraduate curriculum,
which in 1970 led to adoption of
the 12-week/12-week/12-week
term system and the change in
distribution requirements; the
separate coeducation studies
which led to decisions to admit

women to the law school but to
remain all-male at the

undergraduate level; establish-
ment of academic goals and
priorities for each
undergraduate department;

and the definition of specific

Because the _ Self-Study
Report is the result of an inter-
nal re-examination process that
has been going on continuously
at Washington and Lee for
many years, according to Par-
sons, ‘“‘every student, every pro-
fessor, every dean and every
trustee has had a hand in get-
ting it together -- although some
may not have realizied it.”

An 11-member committee of
teachers and administrators
from other colleges visited the
W&L campus last week to
speak first hand with students,
professors and W&L ad-
ministrators as part of the reac-
creditation process. Chairman
of the so-called ‘‘visiting com-
mittee’’ is Dr. William Havard

bilt University in Nashville, and
until recently the dean at
Virginia Tech.

drews, who represents the
Southern Association of Col-
leges and Schools.

A companion to the printed
Self-Study Report is the 1977-78
“Fact Book,” the latest -- and
largest -- of the annual volumes
edited by Parsons. The Fact
Book consolidates all the
Statistical data about
Washington and Lee and all its
matters of record, together with
an historical context in most
cases for purposes of com-
parison.

Taken together, the Self-
Study Report and the Fact Book
-- 568 pages in all -- constitute
the current official statement of
Washington and Lee’s
character, its goals, and its
aspirations and expectations
for the foreseeable future, ac-
cording to the university.

Copies of both the grey-
covered Self-Study Report and
the red-covered companion
1977-78 Fact Book are on deposit

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Two months ago, we applauded the end of the con-
troversy between the Student Music Union and the
Cockpit. But in light of the resignation of Galen
Trussell from the chairmanship of the SMU, our
speculation appears to have been more along the line
of wishful thinking. Trussell cited his difficulty in
dealing with Cockpit manager Dan Scott as a stumbl-
ing block between the SMU and the Cockpit relation-
ship. Scott told Trussell that he has the power to veto
all entertainment in the Cockpit, and that he has been
empowered to charge a cover without consulting the
student Executive Committee.

Student funded entertainment should not be af-
fected by the whimsical autocratic decision of the
Cockpit’s manager. Free entertainment for the
Cockpit is a gift from the students for the students,
payed for by the students. If our memory serves us
correctly, nothing is written which specifies that Stu-
dent Music Union entertainment has to be held in the
Cockpit.

There are many similar establishments in town
that would jump at the chance for free entertainment.
They might also consider lowering competitive beer
prices to further enhance their establishments to at-
tract student patronage. In addition, moving SMU
entertainment in town might help inprove relations
between the townspeople and the college students.
The time has come for the new Music Union leader-
ship to consider moving student funded entertain-
ment from a hostile atmosphere to a friendly one.

For the 1526 who didn’t know where I was last week,
I was running for student body president. To the

faithful 177 who knew, many thanks. I feel like -

Leonidas at Thermopylae with his faithful 300 Spar-
tans. Both causes were worth fighting for , but 300
Spartans. Both causes were worth fighting for, but
remember, ‘‘This time it matters’.

‘This time”’ the campaign trail was long and hard.
I am truly sorry I didn’t have a chance to barnstorm
at the Phi Kap and SAE hous’ houses. I know the guys
out there were itching to hear my philosophies again,
but I knew I could count on their votes and I wanted to
hit other frats which weren’t so dependable. It did
something to me to see both the entire houses mar-
ching down to the polls in formation singing ‘“Yes, my
pap was a Phi Kap”’ and ‘‘Half the world is...”’

This was the first campaign that was actually car-
ried to the law school, and they were ready for us. The
enthusiasm and intelligence they used to judged the
candidates was to be expected. The huge turnout for
the law school campaign speeches was admirable.
The law students obviously put as much thought into
the election as the undergraduates. The accusation
that the law students would vote for Dudley just
because he was one of their own is unfounded. Sure,
he received 80 percent of the law school vote, but ap-
parently they liked his campaign and platform

So congratulations to the three winners. Waller
‘‘Beau Dudley brings his steadfast, unshakeable, and
never yielding strong stand on the issues to the office
of president. He is sure to make the right decisions
next year and will use his level-headedness and unof-
fensive natur to do it. No one needs to worry with
Beau in the driver’s seat. Bill ‘‘Censorship’’ Tucker
(his friends call him ‘honest SAB’’) is an opponent of
secrecy in government and supports openness and
honesty as has been evidenced by his job on the SAB
this year. Tucker also supports the free press and has
promised to do his utmost to see the RtP unhindered
in its investigative pursuits. McCarthy, as has
already been mentioned in in the RtP, will do a good
job.

With such capable men representing the student
body next year there is no need to fear the inevitable
‘“‘dark cloud of Mordor’’. They will do their best to
fend off any attacks of extreme liberalism and any
change which could be interpreted as radically in-
novative will be wisely cast aside. Their good sense
will govern them, and they, will govern us.

LETTERS TO EDITOR |

Responses to editorial outcry

speak out on RtP

Students

Dear Editor:

I’m so glad that someone has
finally decided to put you and
your conspiring cohorts in their
rightful places. Bill Tucker,
famed SAB chairman and now
vice-president of the student
body, has taken it upon himself
to do away with the first amend-
ment and take away your
freedom of speech. Well, I say
bully to that, right on Bill, Sieg
Heil, and all that stuff.

Big Bill contends that the
RTP is a perfect example of
shabby, irresponsible jour-
nalism, and I couldn’t agree
with him more. Look at what
this paper prints — the truth,
how inexcusable! It exposes
corruption, stupidity, in-
competency, all the qualities
that make our student organiza-
tions so great. This is the kind of
reporting that past RTPs never
had the courage or the convic-
tion to attempt, but I say bring
back the sniveling cowards,
they never get anybody upset
anyway. Gallagher, Howard,
Barnes, have you no feelings,
“have you no sense of common
decency left?”’

Honest Bill instead wants the
RTP to reflect the collective
opinions of the student body and
print that in the paper instead of
the opinions of a few flaming
liberals who want to change
what’s wrong with the system
and not just be middle-of-the-
road, do-nothing meatheads.
It’s obvious to me that Mr.
Tucker is in the right here.
Wouldn’t you rather read the
journalistic endeavors of a
group of peabrains than in-
telligent, gutsy reporting? I
would.

It’s time the RTP learned its
lesson and with Mr. Tucker in
such power, I can see this paper,
becoming what all papers
become when freedom is
abolished — propaganda. In the
futute I can see the RTP espous-
ing the glories of the SAB, the
saintlihood of Charlie Hulfish,
and the innocence of fraternity
life. Right on again Bill, power
to the proletariat, workers

unite, down with the
bourgeoisie. With a philosophy
such as this, arent’ you glad you
voted for Bill Tucker, don’t you

wish everybody else did?
Sincerely yours,
Nikolai L.
Mr. Editor:

After due consideration, I’ve
decided to write this letter in
the hope of making some con-
structive criticism of the paper,
and also for the purpose of mak-
ing some suggestions for the
general improvement of the
Ring-tum Phi’s quality. First of
all, let me state that I believe
that this paper has served a
useful purpose in making the
student body more aware of
W&L community matters. Past
papers have been more famous
for their ‘‘press_ release’
framework, in which the major
source of interest seemed to be
the size of the latest alumni
donation. This year’s Ring-tum
Phi, however, has given a
broader perspective of the
school, with articles ranging
from EC actions to the need for
a fraternity co-op for food pur-
chasing. Also, the range of
feature articles on entertain-
ment opportunities, bookstore
and record shop specials, and
surrounding social conditions,
have kept me informed and
amused.

The paper’s weaknesses,
however, are obvious and have
received their due attention.
Stories are sometimes _in-
complete, distorted, uncor-
roborated, or taken out of con-
text. Some of the blame natural-
ly lies on the newspaper staff.
By and large, though, the
reporters are a hardworking,
largely unappreciated group
who’ve been unfairly criticized
for paper weaknesses over
which they have little or no con-
trol. In particular, I’m referr-
ing to the fact that the W&L stu-
dent body does not support the
paper. The staff’s size is appall-
ingly small, and _ several
members are forced to write 2
or more articles per issue. Con-
sidering the fact that these
students also have academic
responsibilities, I find that the
work they do accomplish is
quite satisfactory. Also, it must
be remembered that most of the
students who work on the paper
are not experienced journalists,
and therefore their articles
quite naturally will be a bit rag-
ged around the edges.

What does bother me, though,
is the lack of student interest in
the paper. Though many
students freely criticize the
paper, few are willing to try to
improve it by hitching on the

staff. Personally, I think that
the paper provides an ideal op-
portunity for the budding young
journalist, a concerned student,
or a light-hearted comic to get
their word across. After all, the
name of the game is com-
munication, and a_ college
newspaper is probably one of
the freest forums available. As
a reporter, your only duty is to
yourself and to the truth, and in
this world, with its constant
concern for apperances, there
aren’t too many places where
you can Say that.

So, I would like to see more
student involvement on the
newspaper, and perhaps also
some advice or help from the
Journalism school. Since their
business is the media, I’m sure
any help would be _ well-
received. An arrangement
might even be set up by which
students could obtain credit by
working on the paper, in
cooperation with the Jour-
nalism department’s courses.

Well, I’ve said about all I’ve
had to say, and I appreciate the
opportunity to say it. In most
countries, such free speech is
not permitted. Think about it.

Yours Respectfully,
Robert Sartelle ‘79

New pres.

says thanks

To the W&L Community:

At the risk of understating
things, I was extremely pleased
by the results of the Student
Body Elections. It was very
gratifying to receive such a
margin, and perhaps more im-
portantly to see almost 70 per-
cent of us go to the polls. That is
a clear indication to me that we
all realize the importance of the
Executive Committee, and I
will do my best to uphold the
trust you have given me.
Thanks so much to all of you
who worked for me and turned
out the vote on Monday. I hope
that at this time next year we

can say that W&L is a bit

stronger and closer for your ef-
forts.

Sincerely,

Beau Dudley

Freshmen

bothered
by pests

To the Editor:

Since coming to W&L in
September, my room and all the
others on the first floor of Davis
dorm have been infested with
silverfish. I have put up with
these pests for long enough! I
am sick and tired of having to
chase these vermin around my
room. I would like to know if
these rooms have been exter-
minated? and if not why? This
problem should be taken care
of, after all it is hard enough for
two people to live together in a
small room without having to
contend with the silverfish too.
The Administration’s attention
to this problem would be great-
ly appreciated.

Steven M. Everett ‘81

Dear Editor:

I am writing this letter ex-
hausted with scattered silver-
fish remains on the soles of my
feet. For the past ten minutes I
have unsuccessfully attacked
the hordes of silverfish that in-
fest our hall. This is not only a
nuisance but a vile health viola-
tion and I find it astounding that
these rooms have not been
fumigated. I find it a gross ig-
norance and can’t believe the
Administration’s apparent
disconcern for the student’s liv-
ing conditions. I paid $525 to live
in Davis dorm for this year and
didn’t expect to be placed in a
vermin infested dump. I hope
this problem can be (ex)ter-
minated!

James J. Duplessie
Class of 1981

by Robert Boardman Tremblay

It was a night spent with the
masters Saturday night at
Jackson Hall. In attendance
were two of the leading French
Impressionistic composers,
Dukas and Debussy as well as
two of the leading German
Romantic composers,
Mendelssohn and Brahms.
Their music and its per-
formance by the Rockbridge
Orchestra and Chorus was in-
deed exciting.

The concert began with the
music of Dukas, a composer
famous for the highly popular
“‘Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” but
Saturday night the fanfare from
his ballet “La Peri” was per-
formed. This piece was arrang-
ed for brass and tympani and
the playing throughout was
crisp, and in the tradition of the
fanfare, boisterous and arous-
ing, a perfect opening for the
other fine music that was to
follow.

The Romanticism of Felix
Mendelssohn was next. This
composer of immense genius
died tragically young, but still
managed to compose many
masterpieces and his Sym-
phony No. 4 , ’The Italian,” is
one of them. Mendelssohn’s
music lacks the pathos of most
Romantic music and instead
looks to the style of J. S. Bach
for influence, and the many
complex fugues that appear in
Mendelssohn attest to this fact.
Also apparent in his style is a
classical clarity and control
that contemporaries such as
Berlioz seldom displayed. All
these characteristics as well as
Mendelssohn’s' puckish
melodies were brought out
splendidly by the Rockbridge
Orchestra under the baton of
Professor Stewart. The first
movement features some tricky
woodwind passages, the third
movement some devilish horn
writing especially in the trio’
and the fourth movement a
quick rhythmic figure that
highlights the saltarello, and

though not all of these sections
were played immaculately, the
performance was lively and
captured the lyrical, emotional
flavor of Italy that Mendelssohn
no doubt found so fascinating on
his visit there.

The ethereal, Oriental
flavored music of Debussy
followed the Mendelssohn —
Noctures: ‘‘Nuages and Fetes’.
And its whole tone

dominated scales offered an in-
teresting contract to the
diatonic patterns of the German
master. The playing of this
piece was truly exceptional
with a lovely English horn solo
included. The melancholy tonal
qualities of this instrument
have really never been ex-
ploited enough, with this piece

ed amendment ratified. The
Virginia Senate has since killed
ratification in Virginia for the
sixth year in a row.

Another issue on which the
Democrats took a_ clearlv-
defined stand was in their sup-
port of Allen Bakke’s contention
that he was the victim of
reverse discrimination.
Seventy-two percent of the
members said they think it was
wrong for Bakke to be derpved
of going to medical school
despite having a_ better
academic record than a black
who was admitted to the same
medical school. Eighteen per-
cent said they believe
minorities deserve special con-
sideration.

Seventy-one percent of the
members said they favor the
proposed Panama Canal Trea-
ty. The treaty, which would
gradually give Panama control
over the canal by the year 2000,
was disapproved of by 16 per-
cent of the members. Thirteen
percent were undecided.

More hotly contested issues
were: the reinstatement of
capital punishment, the
deregulation of natural gas and
coeducation for Washington and
Lee.

Coeducation was voted down
by YD member 56 to 41 percent.
Earlier in the year a coeduca-
tion poll administered to the en-
tire student body by the Ring-

tum Phi indicated 56 percent of
the student body was in favor of
coeducation. Coeducation was
most recently voted down by
theBoard of Trustees in
February, 1976.

A slim majority of YD
members favored capital
punishment. Forty-six percent
of the members said they
favored reinstituting the’ death
penalty, while 44 percent were
opposed.

Deregulation of natural gas
was also voted down by a small
margin. Thirty-eight percent of
the Democrats were opposed to
deregulation of natural gas,
while 36 percent thought it
would be a good idea. A large
group of students, 26 percent
did not express an opinion.
Deregulation of natural gas
would have the effect of raising
gas prices to level more
realistic in terms of demand
and supply characteristics of
the market.

The poll also touched on the
subject of the neutron bomb.
Thirty-nine percent of the YDs
polled favored production of the
bomb, while 43 percent disap-
proved of production. Eighteen
percent of the members
surveyed did not have an opi-
nion on the bomb which is
designed to kill people with
deadly radiation while leaving
buildings standing.

Another approach in order for next Ariel

by Parker Potter

The working concept behind
this article is ‘perhaps another
approach is in order.” As editor
of Ariel, I find myself in an
curious position. Somehwere
deep in the bowels of
Washington Hall in the magic
money place, there is a little
treasure chest with Ariel’s
name on it. That little chest con-
tains more than enough
dabloons to publish another
Ariel like the first one.

As well I have maintained on
several occasions that I would
indeed publish two Ariels.
There is only one variable lack-
ing in the equation. That is the
aspect over which I have the
leat control, the volume of stu-
dent contributions. I can’t
publish what I don’t have.

Perhaps another approach is
in order. There are several
possibilities. I could abandon
my plans to publish a second
Ariel. This is no_ solution
because I remain convinced

that there resides much un-
tappe talent in the W&L com-

munity capable of writing fully
accepted and _ worthwhile
creative pieces.

Convinced as I am of the real
need for a second Ariel, I could

exercise my _ editorial
perogative and sit down and
crank out a _ bunch of

“literature” and fill an Ariel. I
certainly don’t want to do that
and you certainly don’t want to
read that.

What is needed is a new and
fresh way of enticing student

writers to submit to Ariel.
Realizing that I write more and
better things when I have a
reason to write, my cronies and
I have some up with a two pro-
nged solution to the present
death contributions.

First, we are going to attempt
to put together a dramatic sec-
tion in Ariel. That is to say we
are going to attempt to string
together several pieces dealing
in different ways with different
sides of a particular idea or
question. Our two working ideas
we have are as follows:

 

 

Harriet Thomas.

The Alexander-Withrow House
3 West Washington Street
Antique Shop & Country Inn

A restored historic landmark with five period-furnished guest suites
AAA and COUNTRY INNS AND BACK ROADS. A different
experience in overnight hospitality for those who love fine things.
Students may make reservations for their parents and tour the
house from 10-5 daily. Wednesday until 2:00 or write Mrs.

 

One idea was a group of
works which deal primarily
with a particular geographical
region or place. That is not to
suggest a bunch of pieces all
about the same place but rather
a collection of essentially

geographically oriented pieces.

 

That would include impressions
or descriptions of various
places as well as narratives
whose action is determined by
virtue of a particular setting.
Another thematic suggestion
was based upon the outpouring

Construction progresses smoothly but new library holds surprises

for students.

Library

 

Students to move books

by Jim Lynn

“The main concern we have
is to involve the entire student
body and faculty in the move-
ment of the library from the
current building to the new
structure,’’ Maurice Leach
said.

With this statement, Leach,
the head librarian, has isolated
the one aspect of the new
library which has remained
with the project since the first
planning meetings in the fall of
1968. That committee wrote the
building program and was com-
posed of students, faculty and
administration. The commit-
tee’s main objective was to see
that the entire campus be con-
cerned and involved in the plan-
nings and workings of the $9.26
million structure.

For this reason, Leach wants
the students to actually move
the books after the new building
is ready for occupancy.

“IT want the students and
faculty to have a vested interest
in what should be the center, or
hub, of intellectual and cultural
activity on the campus,’’ he
said.

The actual movement is plan-
ned for an undertermined time
between December 15 and
January 3 of the next school
year, Leach said. The school
has hired a moving consultant
who has suggested two means
of possible action.

The consultant’s first sugges-
tion is similar to Leach’s pro-
posal. Eight lines of students
would pick up approximately
one foot of books from eight
locations in McCormick and
walk them over to the new
building. Portions of the com-
merce and biology libraries will
also become part of the new
library.

The other approach that the
consultant suggested was to use
four forklifts to move larger
boxes of books.

Leach said that the method of
using students would take one
day while the school would have
to wait nine days for the
forklifts to make the move.

The furniture that is in the
library now would be moved in
one week no matter what means
are used to move the books,
Leach said.

The final decision on what
system will be used has yet to
be made, however.

McCormick Library now
houses approximately 175,000
volumes, and the new library

#z¢te

will have a capacity of 500,000
volumes. Most definately,
Leach said, the new facility will
be spacious and un-cluttered.

The library will be able to
seat 800 students which is 425
more than the current structure
can accommodate.

The 130,000 square-foot facili-
ty will be the largest structure
on the campus. But its five
stories will in no way loom over
the other buildings on the hill.
Because it is being built on the
slope over Wood’s Creek, the
library will actually be on the
same level as the other
buildings on campus.

The rear of the building will
have many windows to take ad-
vantage of the panoramic view
of the mountains.

One of the more impressive
sights that the student will see
upon entering the library will be
the front lobby. This spacious
and comfortable room will lead
to an auditorium, and at the
right of the lobby will be a large
stairwell to the second floor.
This floor will also have two
elevators.

The main floor will have a cir-
culation desk opposite the
stairwell and the reference
library behind the lobby. The
reference library offices will be
in the middle of that room.

Due to the size of the struc-
ture, rather than have students
travel the entire building in
search of assistance, there will
be an intercom system
throughout the building that
will be connected to the circula-
tion desk on the main floor.

At the end of the reference
wing will be an area specifically

(continued on page 12)

favored only 565-441, or 54-46
percent.

EC members pointed out that
the law school voted 200-10 for
extra law school representa-
tion, but only 128-101 for more
freshman representation. That
would seem to account for the
discrepancy between the two
amendment votes. And, as Jim
Underhill said, it would seem to
indicate the law school was only
interested in extra representa-
tion for itself, not in an abstract
argument for fair representa-
tion of all classes.
Undergraduate indignation at
this seeming hyprocrisy
underlay much of the discussion
on whether voting on the
amendment should be extended
another day.

Underhill began the discus-
sion on extending voting by say-
ing he thought keeping the vote
open “would distort what is a
pretty accurate reflection of
student opinion.’’ He expressed
his concern that the law school
would turn out its 60 or 70
students who did not vote on the
amendment, Monday, while
undergraduates would lose in-
terest in the issue because it did
not bear on them directly. He
Said that would tend to distort
student opinion.

Tom Healy, upperclass law
representative, responded that
turning out the vote is part of
any political action. He said by
having more students vote, it
would more conclusively reflect
student opinion. Speaking about
the vote he said, ‘‘Right now it’s
accurate but inconclusive.”

Law school representative
Jackie Boyden added, ‘‘With a
margin that close, it’s only right
to keep it open.”’

Although it was mentioned
only briefly, undergraduate EC
representatives seemed to
dislike the idea of another law
representative in light of the re-
cent election of rising third year
law student Beau Dudley as stu-
dent body president. Senior EC
representative Mike Missal
said he would not have voted for
the measure had he known
Dudley was going to be elected.

When the motion to extend
voting on the referenda to
Wednesday was voted on, only
Boyden, Healy, Underhill and
Griffin voted for it. Andy
Bodenstab, Missal, Doug
Perkins, Chris Gammon, Jack
Bovay, Jim Davis and Steve
Abraham voted against it.
Underhill’s support of the
measure was particularly sur-
prising, considering his seem-
ing opposition during discus-

someone to reapply to W&L
after being convicted of an
honor offense. The proposed
amendment stipulated that at
the time of an honor conviction,
a student could ask for readmit-
tance to the University. At that
time the Executive Committee
would decide when and if a stu-
dent could reapply. However, 57
percent of the voting, voted to
retain the single penalty option.

Honor Code changes

(continued from page 1)

Graduated Penalties

The law school’s recommen-
dation that a convicted honor of-
fender be permitted to reapply
for admission to Washington
and Lee—after a certain time
period based on EC approval—
was subject to an extended
discussion Monday night.

EC law school representative
Tom Healy argued that a choice:
of penalties would make the
honor system “more flexible.”
He said that an honor trial
should be a two-step process:
(1) is he guilty? and (2) has his
conduct been so reprehensible
that he should be forced to leave
school?

Supporters of the law school
proposal said they were in favor
of a single sanction, but wanted
a less severe penalty to make
the honor system more adop-
table to the varying cir-
cumstances of individual cases.

Doug Perkins, senior EC
representative, pointed out that
the undergraduates had re-
jected the graduated penalty
proposal in Monday’s referen-

dum vote by a margin of |

roughly two-to-one.

Executive Committee presi-
dent Jim Underhill outlined pro-
cedural complications with the
optional penalties. In a public
trial, the defendant would have
to be found guilty first, and then
go through another hearing to
determine the penalty, he said.

University President R.E.R.
Huntley ‘‘said we don’t have the

authority to make that
change,’’ Underhill added. The
EC could, however, make a
recommendation to the Board
of Trustees, but only the
Trustees can change school

’ policy so a convicted honor

violator can apply for readmis-
sion to W&L. When put to a

vote, the law school fell short, .

losing by one vote. In favor of
the graduated penalty were:
Healy, Perkins, Mike Missal,
George Griffin, and Jackie
Boyden. Opposed to the law
school proposal’ were:
Underhill, Jim Davis, Steve
Abraham, Jack Bovay, Chris
Gammon, and Andy Bodenstab.
Neil Pentifallo was absent.

Investigators

Passed by the EC was a pro-
posal which allows two “ran-
domly” selected EC members
and one student to conduct the
pre-trial investigation of a
reported honor violation. It was
specified that the student in-
vestigator would come from the
same ‘‘school’’ as the accused

(i.e. commerce school, law
school, school of arts, and
school of sciences).

If any two of the three in-:

vestigators feel that there is
sufficient evidence of a possible
honor violation, the EC will go
to trial on the case to determine
guilt or innocence. The proposal
passed, 9-2.

Conviction
The EC voted to retain its cur-
rent two-thirds vote of

members present for conviction
of an honor offense. The law
school had recommended that
the EC raise the margin to a
three-quarters guilty vote.

Ray Laven, a member of the
SBA subcommittee that drew
up the honor code changes, said
that ‘‘in light of the single sanc-
tion, I think we have to consider
a three-quarters vote for con-
viction.”’

Jackie Boyden, EC law school
representative, added that the
three-quarters vote was
necessary because of the
“severity of the sanction.”’

    
  
  
   

The undergraduate EC
members argued that the honor
system was difficult enough to
maintain with the two-thirds
guilty vote. If EC members
were unable to attend an honor
trial and the margin required to
convict was .a_ three-quarter
vote, ‘it would make the
system a joke.”’

During the course of the
debate on the three-quarters
proposal, it was revealed that
the law school had expected to
receive an additional EC
representative, expanding the
membership of the Executive
Committee.

The proposal that a three-
quarters vote of EC members
attending an honor trial vote
guilty to render a verdict of

guilty failed, 7-4. In favor of the
proposal were: Boyden, Healy,
Davis, and Gammon. Opposed
to the motion were: Perkins,
Bovay, Underhill, Missal, Grif-
fin, Abraham, and Bodenstab.

—Underhill clarified the com-
plications of a convicted honor
violator remaining on campus.
“The administration will take
care of that; it is their respon-
sibility.”

EC president, lobbied for ad-
visors to question witnesses
directly; the accused should
give his own testimony, he said.
The proposal including this
charge was passed by the EC.

Rockbridge

concert

(continued from page 9)
Dvorak’s ‘‘New World Sym-
phony” the only famous works
that come to mind which effec-
tively emphasize this member
of the oboe family.

The lush, beautiful sonorities
of one of music’s greatest com-
posers, Johannes Brahms, con-
tinued the program after a
short break for the stage to be
prepared for the Rockbridge
Chorus. This ensemble, under
the direction of Professor Spice,
was obviously in good voice for
Saturday’s night’s concert.
Their singing of the Four A
Capella Songs Op. 62 was
superbly balanced, though I
was slightly partial to the lovely
soprano voices. The tenors and
the basses shined in the Three
Songs also by Brahms, who
along with Schubert,
Schumann, Wolf, and Mahler,
was one of the greatest com-
posers of Romantic lieder, and

after listening to Saturday
night’s program, it’s easy to
hear why.

The concert concluded with
the Rockbridge Orchestra join-
ing the Chorus in a performance
of Brahms’ Nenia Op. 82. This
work is ultra-Romantic and
both the orchestra and the
chorus under the direction of
Professor Spice captured the
piece’s somber, elegiac quality
as well.

One cannot emphasize
enough the accomplishment of
this group of musicians, con-
sisting mostly of law, college
and high school students,
teachers, wives of teachers, and
of course Rockbridge county
residents. None of these per-
formers are professionals, and
the success of this concert and
other concerts is due largely to
a great deal of hard work on
their part and on the parts of
Professors Spice and Stewart.
Of course, talent is there, but
without a dedicated effort, it is
never fully realized. Saturday
night’s concert proved what a
‘little’ dedication can do.

of literature today on women by
women. Our is a rather unique
environment from which to look
at women from a distinctly
male point of view. Pieces on
women by men then, is another
possible thematic focus.
Perhaps writing in a particular
direction is easier.

The second coercion we will
attempt to use is money. As |
have said’ I write better thwne
there is a tanglible reason to
write. Ariel is offering in the
form of two cash prizes, two
tangible reasons to contribute
to the second issue. Piezes of $15
each are being offered for the
best piece of prose and the best
piece of poetry received bet-
ween now and April 1.

These prizes will not be an in-
house thing, those working ex-
tensively with me on Ariel will
not be eligible.

In closing let me say go to it!
The spring edition of Ariel
depends on you. I gotta have

Library movement planned

(continued from page 10)

for audio-visual aides. Also on
this floor will be a browsing
room which will display the
library’s new books. There will
be an open lounge area which
will contain all of the recent edi-
tions of periodicals.

The first lower level will have
a rare book room which Leach
hopes to give a “‘club’’ at-
mosphere. Next to this will be a
rare book work room and desks
for visiting scholars. This level
will also have a vault for rare
books.

In another part of the floor
will be two seminar rooms
which will hold 20 people. Both
rooms, like many other rooms
in the building, will be wired for
television. This floor also has
four smaller conference rooms.

This floor will havemany of
the 560 study carrels that willbe
placed throughout the building.

There also will be 31 locked
studies for faculty members
and students doing work on
honors papers, Leach said.

He emphasized that the facili-
ty will be spacious and com-
fortable, and to aid in that
cause, many lounge chairs will
be on all levels.

The other lower levels will
have conference rooms, book
stacks, and study lounges for
smokers.

The library auditorium will
hold 100 people and will not be a
fixed permanent structure like
the DuPont auditorium. The
floor will be flat, and the chairs
will be movable so that the
room can be used for a large ex-
hibit. There will be a stage and
screen for speakers and visual
displays.

Leach said that the new
library will be fully carpeted,

   

oo

*

sound proof and open for use 24
hours a day, all week long.

To avoid confusion over the
location of books, each floor will
be color-coded to aid students in
located a certain department or
book.
