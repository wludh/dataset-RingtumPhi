Pub Board suspends paper

Student Body Prints Ring-tum Phi

The Publications Board voted
to suspend publication of the
Ring-tum Phi at a Pub. Board
meeting Wednesday afternoon.

The Board was unanimous in
their sentiments, voting 6-0 to
end publication.

The vote was reportedly in
protest over the Executive
Committee’s action Monday
night which had the effect of
overturning the Pub. Board’s
decision to fire Gallagher as
editor of the Ring-tum Phi.

Ryland Owen, chairman of
the Publications Board, and
Robert Keefe, administration
advisor, had resigned from the

Board prior to the meeting in
protest of the EC’s action.
Temp Webber and Mike
Gallagher also were not present
for the vote.

A spokesman for the Publica-
tions Board said that publica-
tion of the student newspaper
would be suspended until an
understanding is reached bet-
ween the Pub. Board and the
EC concerning authority and
responsibility over the Ring-
tum Phi.

Publications Board members
feel that the EC’s decision
makes them responsible for the
content of the paper without

authority over the paper.

Gallagher is an editor the
Pub. Board felt it no longer
wants to take responsibility for,
the spokesman said. However,
the main issue is EC authority
over Publications Board deci-
sions.

Also discussed at the meeting
was a plan for direct student
funding for the newspaper. Stu-
dent funds are now channeled
through the Executive Commit-
tee.

The Pub. Board feels that the
Executive Committee should
not have jurisdiction over Pub.

EC reinstates Gallagher

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
voted to reinstate J. Michael
Gallagher as editor of the Ring-
tum Phi Monday night. The EC
vote has the effect of overturn-
ing last week’s Publications
Board decision to dismiss
Gallagher from his duties as the
student aewspaper’s editor.

The vote, 8-4, reflected the
two-thirds majority required of
the EC to finalize the act of
reversing the Pub. Board’s
dismissal attempt.

(The student body constitu-
tion prescribes that Washington
and Lee’s student government
must attain a two-thirds majori-
ty vote in two consecutive

meetings to overturn action
taken by the Publication Board.
The initial vote to overrule the
Pub. Board was taken last
Tuesday at a specially called
EC meeting.)

The Executive Committee’s
action brings to an end the three
weeks of controversy surroun-
ding Gallagher and the April 20
joke issue of the newspaper, the
Rank-tam Poon.

Three members of the
Publications Board read
prepared statements restating
their reasons for Gallagher’s
dismissal.

Ryland Owen, chairman of
the Pub. Board, said that it was
“not realistic’ for the EC to

Muckrakers accept

~WLUR challenge

WLUR. has challenged the
Ring-tum Phi to a softball game
to be held next Friday at 3 p.m.
The Ring-tum Phi
‘“‘Muckrakers” have officially
accepted the challenge ac-
cording to player-coach Mike
Gallagher.

‘We are going to beat the hell
out of that halfa radio station.
Those disk jockeys are just all
mouth,” said Gallagher.

WLUR coach Bob deMaria
called Gallagher a liar and said
that he doubted his team would
get much fair pre-game publici-
ty. ‘‘Thata Gallagher is a bigga
mouth. Alla he can do isa printa
smut and dirty words.”’
DeMaria had more to say, but it
got lost ina mouth full of pasta’

WLUR program director
Mark Mainwaring expressed
some fears as to whether his
team will be ready. “The Phi
looks tough, as it always does.
Our guys might have some pro-
blems hitting their slur ball.”

Mainwaring did say that he
expected ‘‘the Load’’ and
“‘Travae’’. to . give, the
Muckrakers some trouble. “If
the Phi doesn’t watch out, they
might wind up with tobacco
juice intheireyes.” +

Gallagher said the Phi has a
surprise in store for the “halfa
radio station”. He and top-
salaried superstar Pete Goss
have patched up their dif-
ferences, at least until the
series is over, according to
Gallagher. “Pete and I have
had our little differences in the
past, but we both agree that the
main goal is to make the
Muckrakers number one.”

DeMaria promised that no
matter who won, there would be
fun for all and refreshment for
the participants. “My wifea
makes a gooda pasta. We willa
drink plenty of beer and make
big whoopie.”’

The public is invited.

 

assume that the Pub. Board has
not supported Gallagher all
year. He said that “nine times
out of ten’’ the Publications
Board has sided with the con-
troversial editor over the
business manager in financial
disputes.

Owen also said _ that
Gallagher’s dismissal did not
constitute a threat to future
editors of the Ring-tum Phi.
‘Much like a Democratic con-
vention, we have chosen a can-
didate,’’ Owen explained.
‘‘What we have done
(Gallagher’s removal) is in the
best interest of the University,”
Owen added.

Chris Volk defined the rela-
tionship between a publisher
and an editor for the EC, to
justify the Pub. Board’s right to
fire an “irresponsible” editor.
He also disputed Gallagher’s
contention that the Rank-tam
Poon was a feature section of
the Ring-tum Phi.

‘“‘We are responsible for the
Rank-tam Poon,” Volk said. In

NUMBER 28

SAB Bash Sunday

Harry Chapin will appear in
concert tonight in the Warner
Center at 8 p.m. Tickets are
$4.00 in advance and $5.00 at the
door. Chapin has guaranteed at
least a two and one half hour
concert.

Security for the concert will
be tighter than what has been
true in the past according to
Tucker. “To help us comply
with the ABC regulations, one
uniformed policeman will be
stationed at each entrance to
the gym. There will be also two
gym personnel at each door.”’

Tucker said the SAB will try
to keep the gym completely dry,
including soft drinks. Tucker
does not to be responsible for
any students who violate ABC
violations. Also, by keeping the
gym dry, the SAB will save $300
in cleaning costs.

When asked about drugs,
Tucker said he nor the ABC of-
ficials have any jurisdiction
concerning drugs. He alluded
that smoke could be blown in
the face of an ABC official and
nothing would result.

Jackie Boyden, a twenty-two
year old law student from
Grand Rapids, Michigan, won
the 1978 Nathan Burks Moot
Court Competition April 28. The
annual competition matches
first-year law students of the
Washington and Lee Law
School in appellate advocacy
skills.

All first-year students par-
ticipate in the first round of
competition by preparing ap-
pellate briefs and oral
arguments. After first round
before Burks
Scholars and members of law
school moot court teams, twen-
ty four students compete in a se-
cond round before Burks
Scholars. Burks Scholars are
third-year law students who
assist in the teaching of Legal
Methods and Moot Court
classes to first-year students.
Eight semi-finalists are
selected from this group of
quarter-finalists to argue
before two faculty panels. This
year, the four finalists then
argued before members of the
Virginia Supreme Court.

The competition centered on
a criminal prosecution in the
fictional state of Rockbridge.
The defendant in the problem
case was charged with attemp-

Other activities planned for
the weekend inlude a bluegrass
festival Sunday, and movies in
the Cockpit during the entire
weekend. Freddy Goodhart and
the Second Hand Band will
highlight a Sunday afternoon
full of music, food and other ac-
tivities starting at 2 p.m. The
E.C. will provide 25 kegs of beer
and the University Food Ser-
vices is providing 2500 hot dogs
for the W&L community. The
cookout will begin at 3 p.m.
Another band, Blueridge, has
been contacted and may play
Sunday also.

The SAB will show an in-
teresting film in the Cockpit this
weekend. The Devil in Miss
Jones will be shown Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday nights at
10 and 12 p.m. The film is the
SAB’s annual skin flick, ac-
cording to Tucker. Tucker em-
phasized that this is a private
showing for the Washington and
Lee community. He added that
he believes the SAB has an un-
cut version of the controversial
film. The cost of admission will
be one dollar.

ted importation of a controlled
substance, “‘singatrille,” and
carrying a deadly weapon.
Competitors argued the merits
of an impossibility defense as
the actual substance found was
analysed as cornstarch. An
entrapment defense with the
dilemma of a defendant who
refused to admit he committed
a crime was attempted by the
budding advocates. Illegal
search and seizure debates and
an argument against a flare
pistol posing as a deadly
weapon were relied upon as
well. Boyden described the pro-

’ blem as “‘a real bitch.”’

Participants are judged both
on the quality of written briefs
and oral advocacy. The 1978
Best Brief Award was earned
by James Osick who ranked
sixth in the overall competition.
Finalists included Ken Lyons,
second place, and.Jerrauld
Jones and Dan Westbrook who
tied for third place.

Boyden, the first woman to
take first-place honors in the a!
annual W&L Law School event,
is known for her active role on
the Executive Committee this
year as First Year Law
Representative. She also was
elected recently to the office of
Student Bar Association Vice-
President for 1978-79.

Pub Board decision overturned\sgaq

(continued from page 1)

Gallagher ‘‘ignored’’ his
business manager and the
Publication Board, Volk said.
He concluded his statement by
urging the EC not to overturn
the Pub. Board decision to
remove Gallagher.

An EC vote to overturn the
Pub. Board’s dismissal action
would ‘“‘destroy the purpose of
the Publications Board,’’ cau-
tioned Grant Leister. He also
discussed the relationship bet-
ween the editor and the
business manager this year. “‘It
was (Gallagher’s) responsibili-
ty to inform the business
manager as to the nature of a
radically different issue,’’ he
said.

‘“‘We had to send a message to
future editors that they will be
held accountable,’’ explained
Jeff Bird. He added that in his
estimation the Pub. Board’s ac-
tion would not stifle the
creativity of future editors.

“T stated my case last week
and have nothing more to add,”’
was all Gallagher said in his
defense.

Futher discussion before the
EC vote centered on the prece-
dent of the Executive Commit-
tee overturning a decision of the
Publication Board.

Parker Potter, editor of Ariel,
said that last week’s EC vote to
overturn the Pub. Board’s ac-

395 applicants accept

More than 55 percent of the
applicants offered admission by
Washington and Lee University
for next September have ac-
cepted that offer, the most
favorable confirmation rate in a
dozen years, university admis-
sions officials reported this
week.

As of this week, 396 prospec-
tive freshmen had indicated
their intention to enroll at W&L
next fall. The university seeks
an entering class of 350 to 360
students each year. Based on
past experience’ admissions of-
ficials say, as many as 20 to 25
will decide over the summer not
to attend W&L after all.

W&L processed a total of 972
completed applications this
year. ‘‘Completed applica-
tions” are those for which all

tion constituted ‘“‘a far more
dangerous precedent” than the
Pub. Board’s decision to
remove Gallagher from the
editorship.

“We are the ones who have
the cross to bear as the
publishers of the Ring-tum Phi;
we're the ones stuck with the
decision,’’ he said.

EC president Jim Underhill
questioned Potter’s reasoning.
“It is up to the Committee to
decide the danger of the prece-
dent we set,” he said.

Tom Healy, EC law school
representative, said that the
EC’s decision in the Gallagher
firing ‘‘will long’ be
remembered; this decision is
probably the biggest made by
any student organization”’ in a
long time.

“T can’t look at the Pub.
Board as a completely im-
partial judge in this matter,”’
Healy said. He faulted both
Gallagher and the Publication
Board for an apparent “‘break-
down of communication.”

“We are the press in this in-
stance and we are dealing with
a primarily internal press mat-
ter,” said Potter.

Healy expressed the concern
that students ‘‘down the road’”’
in three or four years would in-
terpret the Gallagher firing as
“an editor getting canned for

transcripts, recommendations
and other required materials
were received. That figure was
down from last year’s 1,320. Dr.
John said the dropoff occurred,
as admissions officials had an-
ticipated, almost entirely
among potential applicants who
recognized they were clearly
unqualified or who had no
strong desire to attend W&L
from the beginning.

The 55 percent confirmation
figure is based on a projection
of 375 freshmen actually enroll-
ing.

In recent years, the confirma-
tion figure has typically been 46
to 48 percent - meaning that
slightly fewer than half the ap-
plicants W&L accepted actual-
ly enrolled.

stirring up controversy.”

‘“‘We’re not blasting him for
investigative reporting or his
liberal attitude,’ Potter said.
“Responsibility up and down
the line, that’s what we’re say-
ing.”’

The Executive Committee
was able to attain a two-thirds
majority to override the
Publications Board decision,
even though two members
changed their votes from last

week. Voting to retain
Gallagher as editor were: Hea-
ly, Underhill, Jackie Boyden,
Steve Abraham, Andy
Bodenstab, Doug Perkins, Jack
Bovay, and Chris Gammon.
Siding with the Publications
Board were: Mike Missal, Jim
Davis, George Griffin, and Neil
Pentifallo.

Underhill and Missal had
voted differently in last Tues-
day’s initial vote.

“I don’t see why (the EC)
should have been in this mess in
the first place,’ explained
Missal. He said that he con-
sidered the Pub. Board’s action
‘‘a personnel change.”’

Underhill said he was un-
convinced by the Pub. Board’s
precedent argument. ‘‘No one’s
ever going to let an editor run
rampant— although
Gallaghker’s come close to doing
it,” he said.

Campus reform
group to organize

A new campus organization is
forming. The as yet unnamed
organization will devote its time
and energy to representing stu-
dent opinion and working
towards the guarantee of
students’ rights, according to
one of the coordinators Dick
Moss.

An organizational meeting ‘is
planned for Tuesday night at 8
p.m. in Room 114 of the student
center. All students interested
in campus politics and in having
their opinions heard should at-
tend this meeting.

In talking about the organiza-

admission to W&L

The objective characteristics
of the September 1978 entering
class - class rank in secondary
school and College Board scores
~ are virtually identical among
the students who have confirm-
ed their intention to attend
W&L as they were among last
fall’s freshman class, the
university said.

University officials attribute
the upswing this year in the con-
firmation rate to substantially
increased recruiting and follow-
up communication of admis-
sions officials, together with the
addition of an essay which all
applicants were required to
submit.

The 400-to-600-word essay had
the effect of discouraging ap-
plications from students whose
interest in attending W&L was

marginal and applications from
students who recognized they
had little chance of being ac-
cepted, the university’s admis-
sions officials said.

“The essay had the effect we
had desired of resulting in a
considerable measure of self-
screening among the potential
applicant pool,” Dr. Lewis G.
John, admissions director and
dean of students, said.

At a recent general meeting,
the W&L faculty formally
reiterated the university's com-
mitment to maintaining a stu-
dent body of superior academic
excellence.

The university restricted of-
fers of admission again this
year to students of academic
quality comparable to the quali-
ty of recent entering classes.

Grant Received by University

The Andrew W. Mellon Foun-
dation has given Washington
and Lee University a $208,000,
four-year grant to support a
number of faculty professional-
development programs, design-
ed to increase the effectiveness
of faculty members as
teacherscholars.

The Mellon grant will support
those activities while the
university raises permanent
funds to continue them through
its own endowment income.

Part of the Mellon grant will
permit Washington and Lee to
bring teachers from other col-
leges and universities and
leaders from business, industry

and government to W&L as
visiting professors either for
one academic term or for a full
academic year.

The grant will also establish a
new program under which en-
tire academic departments at
W&L will visit counterpart
departments at other colleges
when W&L is not in session.
The visitation program will per-
mit critical self-evaluation and
the exchange of professional
ideas and information with
teaching colleagues elsewhere.

The Mellon grant will also
provide funds to permit
teachers, especially younger
faculty members, to visit and
consult individually with col-

leagues elsewhere on their
teaching and their own personal
research. The grant will also
provide supplements on a selec-
tive basis to teachers on leave
in support of particularly pro-
mising or noteworthy research
projects, and will also provide
additional support for
Washington and Lee’s John M.
Glenn summer research and
study program.

The Glenn fund consists of a
$120,000 endowment established
in 1953 by the late Mr. Glenn, an
1879 W&L alumnus who was an
officer of the Russell Sage
Foundation. Each year, approx-
imately 10 to 12 W&L teachers
receive grants from the income

from the Glenn endowment to
help them carry out summer
research and professional self-
development.

tion, Moss said it was time for
the unrepresented segment of
the Washington and Lee student
body to have its needs
represented. Moss said the
coordinators decided an
organization such as this was
needed after all the corruption
that existed in student govern-
ment was uncovered. Moss said
the organization would work to
keep student leaders and
representatives responsible. He
also said the organization would
appeal to the faculty and ad-
ministration to be aware of
students’ rights. ‘‘We as of now,
have no input or control over
how the faculty does its job.
Students need an outlet to com-
plain regarding representative
and faculty performance. Our
organization plans to be that
outlet, for all students.

 

Griffin
Receives

Award

George Francis Griffin IV
was given the Gilliam Award at
the Senior Banquet Tuesday
night.

The Gilliam Award is given
by the undergraduates to the
senior who has done the most
for Washington and Lee. The
Gilliam Award was created in
1963 in honor of Dean Frank J.
Gilliam, who retired in 1963,
after many years as W&L’s
Dean of Admissions. The award
is given solely on the basis of
service, rather than in con-
sideration of need.

Griffin has served as vice-
president of the student body
this year, and has been a dor-
mitory counselor for two years.

He is also one of the founding
members of the recently reac-
tivated Kappa Alpha social

At Henry St. Playhouse

Little Mary Sunshine previewed

. by John Jacobsen

Many members of the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty have long realized the need
for evening activities during the
summer months. In response to
this need the Troubadour
Theatre has formed a profes-
sional guild called the Henry
Street Playhouse and Stock
Company which will open its
season on May 21 with Rick
Besoyan’s,Little Mary Sun-
shine, Set in the Colorado
Rockies at the turn of the cen-
tury, this melodramtic musical
is the tale of the early attempts
to U.S. Forest Rangers to sub-
due the wilderness and the local
Indians. It’s style is that of the
operetta-mode that was so
popular in the nineteenth cen-
tury, and the show, as well as
the atmosphere of the
Playhouse in general, recalls a
period compatible with the style
of restored Lexington. As a lov-
ing lampoon of old-time operet-
tas, Little Mary Sunshine has
become something of an
American favorite.

The playhouse is made up of
25 members selected from both
the University and the com-
munity, and is being guided by
Dr. Albert Gordon and Tom
Ziegler. Both are members of

“Turning Point” is a film for athletes |

by John Ellis
“Turning Point”

This is a film about one of the
world’s greatest athletes, Mikal
Baryshnikov, a ballet star who
defected from Russia to join the
American Ballet Company of
New York. Not that it is a
documentary about M.B., but
instead a soap opera style
‘‘well-made’’ film (Hollywood
guaze-and-twinkle time) about
M.B.’s ballet company. There is
no point letting the mish-mash
of a plot distract from the real
(and only) source of pleasure
here — it is the dance as virile,
poetic, and ‘angelic; the im-
possible’ is made graceful.

the Washington and Lee
Theatre, and can be sighted for
their superb production ofThe
Beau Stratagem last fall. Two
Lexingtonians have the leads in
the production, even though the
cast is mostly composed of
students currently involved in
the Total Theatre Program.
David Sorrells plays Captain
Big Jim Warrington, and Penni
Westbrook is Little Mary
herself. Students in the cast in-
clude Bill Thistlewaite as Chief
Brown Bear, Barry Godin as
Fleet Foot, Hunt Brown as
Yellow Feather, and Jim
Weatherstone as General Oscar
Fairfax. And of course Jay
Blumberg plays another sup-
porting role as Hank.

Lexington, during the sum-
mer months, has many tourists
who, for some unclear reason,
flock together during the day,
but who have little to see at
night. The Henry Street
Playhouse and Stock Company
hopes to offer a solution to this
typically Lexington problem by
providing light hearted family
shows whose intermissions will
be filled with musical entertain-
ment, stand-up comedians, and
drinks on their fetiv patio. All in
all, it seems to be a general goal
to provide a well balanced even-

ing of Lexington laughs.

Baryshnikov literally hovers
over the film by the love of his
discipline. Anyone remotely in-
terested in how the body can ex-
cell in strength and beauty of
motion must see the film. Im-
agine Julius Ewing’s mid-air
control, O. J. Simpson’s speed
and agility, and George
Foster’s strength. The
equivalents of these skills and a
poetic grace are M.B.’s gifts.
He is the greatest dancer, hence
athlete, of our:time.

Oh, and by the way, the film is
very careful to point out that he

is heterosexual. I repeat:' He,

likes girls (Lest anyone feel this
review is giving W&L the
wrong image. )

Little Mary Sunshine runs
from May 17-21, June 14-18,
21-25, at 8 p.m. with matinees on
June 17 and 24 at 2. For more in-
formation, call the Playhouse at

ELP Show To Air

Beginning at noon this Satur-
day, May 13, WLUR-FM will
feature six continuous hours of

_the music of British supergroup

Emerson Lake & Palmer. Next
week, the “Saturday Afternoon
Special’ (a weekly feature on
WLUR) will focus on the
Beatles.

Keith Emerson was a pioneer
in the development and per-
formance of electronic music,
and worked closely with Bob
Moog in the creation of the
Moog synthesizer. He left The
Nice in 1970 to join up with Greg

Lake (ex-King Crimson) on
guitar and vocals, and Carl
Palmer (ex-Atomic Rooster) on
percussion. ELP rose to inter-
national reknown in the music
field with the release of their
very first album, simply titled
Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.
They’ve released eight LP’s
since then, culminating with
their latest efforts, the highly-
orchestrated Works, Volume 1
and Volume 2.

WLUR may be found at 91.5

nd Then There Were Three
enesis
! Genesis has finally reached

the point attained by. every '
band which achieves commet-; |
¢ial success after years of hard °

Work. Where do they go from
here? With the release of this
album, Messrs. Collins, Banks,
and Rutherford have provided
an answer -nowhere. After serv-
ing as one of the few truly
creative sources in rock for ten
years and nearly a dozen
albums, Genesis has elected to

take its money and run.

No mistake about it - the rich,

swirling texture of the band’s
music is still there. Without any

good melodies, though, it just |

doesn’t go anywhere. Gone are
the. extended, detailed  in-
strumentals on which Genesis
made its well-deserved reputa-
tion. Gone are the band’s
fascinating, if somewhat
bizarre; lyrics. Instead, we
have eleven short songs featur-
ing inane lyrics on subjects
such as cowboys and, Indians
and more. And Then There
Were Three contains at least

three possible‘ singles, one of
which (“Follow You Follow
Me’’) has already been released
to the AM radio market.

It’s useless to point out at this
stage that the departure of lead
vocalist’ Peter Gabriel two

Track Team Ends

Season 5-2

by Bill Sherwin

This past Friday, the track
generals lost their final meet of
the season to Bridgewater,
97-48. The overall record posted
is 5-2, which Coach Norris
Aldridge considered to be
satisfactory. ‘‘We had a very
good year, especially consider-
ing the young age of most of the
team. This year we lose only
five seniors.”

High points of the season in-
cluded victories in the 200 and
100 meter sprints, Captain Jack
Norberg winning both. Co-Capt.
Norelle Scott set a record in the
400 meter hurdles, Rich Byrd
won the 1500 meter race, runn-
ing the equivalent of an 4:17
mile. Richard Weeks set a
record in the 5000 meter run,
and Karl Cheatham set a school
record in the triple jump.

Coach Aldridge praised the
seniors for a job well done this
past season. Graduating will be
4% miler Bill Welch, 3-miler Al
Weeks, miler Kevin Grimm,
sprinter John Morris, and shot
putter Tony Ciucci. Jeff Slat-

coff, who throws the javelin,
will also be leaving after this
Spring.

Aldridge is optimistic for the
team next year. ‘“‘We have a full
440 and mile relay team retur-
ing. We are strong in other
events as well. If we can stay
free of injuries next year, we
should have an_ excellent
team.”

The winners in the recent
meet against Bridgewater were
the mile relay team which ran
its fastest time of the year, Rich
Byrd in the mile, and Jack
Norberg in the 220. ‘‘I was pro-
ud of the team. They are very
young and hung in there,”’ said
Aldridge.

Aldridge did not claim there
were any especially high spots
in the year, instead saying that
youth and talent put a shine on
most of the season. “Lynchburg
was probably our best meet, but
the whole team did really well
all season. I am looking forward
to a very successful season next
year.”

Hopkins and Maryland
Where Are You?

by Ray McNulty

The W&L lacrosse team
defeated Rutgers last Saturday
by a score of 11-9 and is present-
ly ranked seventh in the nation.
Depending on the outcome of
this weekend’s games, W&L
will probably make the NCAA
University Division tournament
for the seventh consecutive
year and will probably play
either Johns Hopkins,
Maryland or Navy.

A question being asked
around the W&L campus is
‘‘Why haven’t we played any of
these teams during the regular
season?”

When Maryland and Navy did
not appear on the W&L lacrosse
schedule, several rumors began
circulating around campus. The
rumor that was the most
popular said that Maryland and
Navy would not play us because
the W&L fans were too obnox-
ious. Although W&L fans have
been known to be a bit rowdy at
times, this was not the reason
W&L did not play Maryland or
Navy this season.

W&L coach Jack Emmer
said that Navy refused to play
W&L because of personal
reasons of Navy coach Dick
Szlasa. Szlasa was the lacrosse
coach at W&L before the ar-
rival of Emmer in 1973. Emmer
said that Szlasa still has strong
sentiments for W&L and does

not want to play against us.
In the situation with
Maryland, Emmer said that the

reason they were not on the
W&L schedule was because of a
lack of communication on the
part of Maryland. Emmer said
that a game between W&L and
Maryland was being planned
for the last weekend in April. He
said that he then heard that
Maryland had already agreed
to play Johns Hopkins on that
weekend. In an attempt to
reschedule the game, Emmer
wrote a letter to Maryland say-
ing that W&L was still in-
terested in playing Maryland.
Emmer said that it took
Maryland nine months to
acknowledge ‘the letter. By
then, Emmer had most of the
W&L schedule arranged. He
said that Maryland wanted to
play us on May 13, but W&L had
already agreed to play Hofstra
on that date. Maryland would
not agree to play on another
date, therefore, W&L did not
play Maryland this year.

W&L has not played John
Hopkins in a regular season
game since 1962, Hopkins winn-
ing 15-4. W&L and Johns
Hopkins have met in_post-
season tournaments three times
with Hopkins winning two out of
the three contests; W&L won
the most recent game in 1975.

Play Hofstra On Sat.

by Sandy Bishop

Led by Charlie Brown’s
sparkling play in and out of the
goal, W&L’s stick team gained
an 11-9 do-or-die victory over
Rutgers University Saturday on
Wilson Field.

The Generals, ranked No. 7 in
this week’s USILA poll, knew
that a loss to the Scarlet
Knights would severely cripple
their chances of gaining a post-
season playoff bid for the
seventh consecutive year.

Led by Brown, who had 14

saves, set up a goal by Johnny
Black, and took a shot himself,
W&L played Rutgers even
before building a_ three-goal
fourth quarter lead which car-
ried the Generals to their ninth
win.
W&L spotted the Scarlet
Knights a 2-0 lead before Jay
Sindler dodged his man, slipped
to one knee, and rammed home
his shot with 6:32 left in the
opening quarter. Jeff Fritz, who
had four goals in one of his
finest efforts of the season,
made it 2-2 three minutes later
— the first of six tie scores.

the team, the season ends.

a fine performance, began turn-
ing every shot away, and at
halftime Rutgers held a narrow
4-3 advantage.

But the Knights committed a
foul just before the half ended,
and the Generals started the
third quarter with a man ad-
vantage. Goals by Sandy
McDonald and Fritz put W&L
in the lead, and then the action
got really hot. ‘“Those two goals
were a big lift for us,”’ said
Coach Emmer. “That got us
over the top.’

But Rutgers was not about to
quit. Just over a minute had
elapsed before Mark Tyree
stole a W&L clearing pass and
tied the contest at five as he
fired into an open net. Both
teams toughened up on defense,
and after three periods the
score stood at 7 to 7. Then
Brown took over.

In the first minute of quarter
No. 4, Brown charged upfield on
a solo clear, found Black open to
the right of the Rutgers net, and
fed him for the tie-breaking
goal. Three minutes later,
Brown made another run, this
one ending in a shot on goal.

*

“Brown was confident out there

Generals win big over Rutgers

Saturday,” Emmer said. “It
was as good a game as he has
played all year.”’

Brown’s play had_ the
Generals fired up and taking
control of the situation. Sindler
dodged his man to score, and
then fed Fritz to make it 10-7
with 5:58 to go. Will Brown
tallied for Rutgers a minute
later, but his point-blank at-
tempt with 1:25 left was stopped
by the Generals’ Brown, and
W&L held on to win.

Coach Emmer cited the per-
formance of Mark Derbyshire,
Black, Fritz and the entire
defense as very important in
Saturday’s win.

Now the Generals face 11-
ranked Hofstra at Mt.
Washington in Baltimore Satur-
day. Hofstra, which had a rocky
early season, has turned things
around and won seven of its last
eight games. Said Emmer,
“They are as good as any
Hofstra team that has beaten us
in the last three years.’’ If the
Generals win Saturday, they
could possibly earn a trip to
next Wednesday’s NCAA
quarterfinal games.

Baseball season ends;
Statistics given

by Warren Crowdus

Commenting on his team’s
5-16 record this spring, baseball
coach Joseph Lyles unsurpris-
ingly termed the season a
“disappointment.”’ But he also
felt that a number of un-
foreseeable circumstances
combined to make the team’s
record worse than it should
have been. He also thought that
the young General team will be
considerably stronger next
season after getting a valuable
year of experience.

The main factor mitigating
the success of this year’s team
was bad weather early in the
season, forcing the postpone-
ment of several home games
against non-ODAC opponents.

Thus, the young and inex-
perienced team was obliged to
start the season on the road
against conference opposition,
including Lynchburg, a peren-
nial baseball powerhouse. Fur-
thermore, all of the cancelled
contests had to be made up in
the second half of the season,
overworking the undermanned
pitching staff. Chip Childs, the
“‘ace’’ of the staff, frequently
worked with only two days rest.

Another damaging factor was
one that haunts many teams:
the injury. Pitcher By Steele
was hurt early in the season,
and was only able to work nine-
teen innings as a result. The
bulk of the pitching burden had
to be borne by only three men.

The season was not without
it’s bright moments, however.
Coach Lyles pointed to two
games in particular, one a loss,
the other a win. He felt that a 6-4
loss at the hands of 15th ranked
Citadel was a high point. The
Generals, behind the strong pit-
ching of Childs, led for most of
the contest, only to be overcome
by a late rally. Lyles was so im-
pressed with the performance
of Childs that he said, ‘“The way
Childs threw, it was a shame
that the entire student body was
not there to see him.’’ The other
highlight was the come from
behind 7-6 win over ODAC
champion Bridgewater.

Tennis Generals 3-0

in Division III

by Mike Farrand

The tennis Generals raised
their record against Division III
schools to 3-0 on Saturday with a
7-2 victory over the Randolph-
Macon Yellowjackets. The
away match at Roanoke
scheduled for Thursday was
rained out. Their overall record
now stands at 9-11.

Ben Johns, Stewart Jackson,
Cody Davis, Doug Gaker, and
David Constine all won their
matches against Randolph-
Macon. Pat Norris played in the
sixth position and also won his
match. In doubles Coach Dennis
Bussard let some junior varsity
players play and from there
came the losses.

Tuesday and Wednesday the
Generals played ninth-ranked
Division III team Salisbury
State and were to go to An-
napolis to battle the tough
Naval Academy Midshipmen.
Press time came before these
scores could be reported. On
Saturday, May 13th, W&L hosts
Emory & Henry at one o’clock.

These last matches are in
preparation for the national
tournament that will be held in
Delaware, Ohio at the Ohio
Wesleyan College on May 17-20.
The Generals will attempt to
better their second place finish
of last year and are seeded first
for the tournament.

Golfers beat Roanoke
still waiting for playoff berth

Led by Jerry Maatman’s
meet low 74, the Washington
and Lee golfers beat Roanoke
392 to 397. Other low scores for
the Generals include Millard
Radford’s 78, Terry Shadrick’s
79, Dave Leunig’s 80 and Andy
Fitzgerald’s 81. The match was
held at the Lexington Country
Club, which has a par 71 course.

Coach Buck Leslie said that
Roanoke, which is a strong Di
vision II team, played a very
good match. John Newton led

the Maroons with a 75. Roanoke
will play postseason golf in the
Division II NCAA Tournament.

The Generals are still waiting
for a postseason playoff birth in
the Division III Tournament.
Undefeated in regular season
play, The Generals are led in
scoring by Jerry Maatman who
will partici pate as an in-
dividual in the Natiomals in
Wooster, Ohio, on May 23. Last
year the team placed 7th out of
20 in the NCAA tournament.

in four runs to pace the W&L at-
tack in that encounter.

Looking over some individual
performances, Lyles felt that
the iron-man performance of
Childs, who worked 68 innings,
and the cleanup hitting of Bob
Szezecinski (.373, 1I5RBIs) were
the best. He was also pleased
with Ted Hissey, who played a
solid third base after three
years of shortstop, Dan
Kingman, who displayed so
much poise and leadership that
he has been named co-captain
of next year’s squad, and Chuck
D’Auria, who hit .283 and
“ought to be able to hit .300 with
his speed.”

Unfortunately, a lack of of-
fense from the traditional
power positions, the outfield
and first base, combined with a
lack of pitching depth and the
effects of the bad weather to
prevent the Generals from win-
ning as many as ten games, in
the opinion of Lyles.

Looking ahead to next season,
Coach Lyles foresses a substan-
tial improvement in W&L’s for-
tunes. This year’s edition was
very inexperienced (13 out of 18
were underclassmen), and will

improve with a year of ex-
perience. Furthermore, a total
of fourteen high school baseball
players have been recruited.
Seven of the fourteen are pit-
chers’ and one of the infielders
was an All-American. ‘That
should give us a much, much
better ball club.” Finally, Lyles
intends to begin work im-
mediately next fall. He en-
courages all athletes not par-
ticipating in a fall or winter

Lacrosse

Schedule

(continued from page 4)

Although both teams are con-
sidered ‘‘lacrosse powers,”
W&L has been unable to
schedule a regular season game
with Hopkins. Coach Emmer
said that there is no definite
reason why Hopkins will not
play W&L, but he feels that
recruiting might have
something to do with it. Emmer
said that W&L and Johns
Hopkins recruit the same type
of student-athlete and by not
playing W&L, Hopkins cuts
down on W&L’s exposure in the
Baltimore area.

When asked if he thought that
W&L might play any of these
three teams in the future, Em-
mer said that he is willing to
play any of them and it is up to
the other schools. Although Em-
mer would like to play these
teams, he said that he feels
W&L can still make the NCAA
tournament without these
teams by working hard and
playing good lacrosse.

So W&L fans, it is not your
fault that Maryland, Navy and
Hopkins didn’t play us this
year. Coach Emmer and the
W&L lacrosse team appreciate
your loyal support and hope you
continue to come out and cheer
for the team. Remember, W&L
plays Hofstra this Saturday.
See you in Baltimore!

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Voice Your Opinion

Once again the administration and faculty have
successfully humbled and shackled a segment of the
student body. The SAB has allowed itself to be kicked
out of DuPont Auditorium, and in so doing, subsub-
jected the student body to low quality showings of top
quality films. The new student “theatres” have rang-
ed from uncomfortable seating in Room 114 of the Stu-
dent Center, to echo-filled Evans Dining Hall.

Fine arts professor Al Gordon has a legitimate
gripe concerning a beer can-filled auditorium on Mon-
day morning but his wrath should not be directed
towards the student body. Buildings and Grounds per-
sonnel are paid to keep this campus and buildings
clean, not the students. Professor Gordon should
realize that DuPont Auditorium is not the only movie
theatre to have a deposit of cans and trash after a
night’s showing of films.

The buildings of Washington and Lee are for the use
of the students. Every other classroom on the
undergraduate campus stays unlocked and available
to students throughout the night. Since Gordon calls
the auditorium a classroom, it should stay open also.
Gordon should not have the authority to forbid
students from using the facilities that are made
available to them by payment of their tuition. Gordon
has acted in direct conflict with the philosophies of his
job- to serve the needs of the students.

Although the SAB initially protested to Gordon,
they now seem to be content with the present situa-
tion. Bill Tucker has asked the E.C. not to intervene
further, for reasons known only to Tucker. Since the
SAB refuses to go over Gordon’s head, the students
now must take matters into their own hands.
Students, do not be afraid to stop Gordon on campus
and give him your opinion on his action. Don’t be
afraid to call him at his office, or even at home, if you
really feel like it. If this doesn’t work, call Dean John
and then President Huntley. Call until something gets
done. If you are worried about possible repercussions
against you, don’t give your name. Students have a
right to the use of this building. We must retain this
right.

Preview For Next Year

Next year’s E.C. has already displayed the in-
telligence it will use next year to make important
decisions. The members obviously put much thought
into the selection of Doug Jackson.and Hank Hall as
co-chairmen of the SAB over Steve-Mangan. Jackson
took a leave of absence from school after being ap-

pointed SAB co-chairman last year. He therefore is _

not aware of the new stipulations placed upon com-
mittees and the increased responsibilities demanded
from their chairman. Jackson has not been in touch
with this year’s student body and it is questionable as
to whether he is too far removed from next year’s stu-
dent body tofairlyrepresentthem..

It may be recalled that Hall was responsible for the
February Grain Party fiasco when an estimated 200
people were admitted free of charge. Bottles of grain

also were stolen.
The E.C. chose these two men and passed over

perhaps the most qualified applicant. Steve Mangan,
through increased publicity and efficient handling of
funds, has turned the film committee into a selfsup-
porting subcommittee of the SAB, and did this during
a year of controversy and turmoil for the SAB. One
can do nothing but speculate as to what heights the
SAB would have reached under Mangan’s guidance.
Good job, fellas.

Student Body Betrayed

The Publications Board is betraying the stu-

dent body for which it was established to serve.

The job of the Pub Board is to ensure the
publishing of the Ring-tum Phi and the Calyx.
The vote the Board took yesterday shows its
main concern is who ultimately controls campus
publications, the student body. or the Publica-

tions Board.

The present members of the Publications
Board are acting as if they own the Ring-tum
Phi. The student body owns the Ring-tum Phi. As
long as the Ring-tum Phi is a guaranteed product
intended for the student body, the student body
deserves to receive one whenever possible.
Three more issues of the Ring-tum Phi were
planned for this year. In light of this knowledge,
the action the Publications Board took was ir-

responsible and purely selfish.

The Executive Committee has been charged
with oppression of the press. The Pub Board’s
action is of the press. The real oppressor here is
the Pub Board. The Pub Board wanted to dismiss

an editor for printing something they did not like.

The Pub Board is the body that wants to suspend

publication of the Ring-tum Phi. In both cases,

the E.C. acted to ensure that the rights and

wishes of the student body were upheld. The E.C.

retained the editor. The E.C. has guaranteed the

student body a newspaper.

According to the Student Body constitution, the
E.C. has appellate jurisdiction over decisions of
the Publications Board. This power is not one of
censorship. This power is rather to guarantee
that the Pub Board will not put into effect any
decision that would be detrimental to the student
body’s interests. Never has the E.C. reviewed
the pages of the Ring-tum Phi before printing.
Never has the E.C. used prior restraint. Now, the
very board which is supposed to publish the
Ring-tum Phi has attempted to restrain it.

The vote of the Publications Board indicates
the Board is unwilling to abide by and accept the
Student Body Constitution. Every Washington
and Lee student must uphold the Constitution.
The members of the Publications Board have
chosen not to. In any community, if an individual
or group of individuals refuses to live according
to the laws intended to protect the community,
the community expels them. Perhaps this is the
action that should be taken against the members
of the Publications Board.

Because a decision of the Publications Board
has been overturned by the judicial branch of the
student government, the Publications Board has
refused to publish the student newspaper. The
Pub Board is acting like the child who ran home
with his ball after he lost the game. j.m.g.

on Controversy

To The Student Body:

The Executive Committee
voted to overrule the decision
by the Student Publications
Board to dismiss J, , Michael:
Gallagher as editor of the Ring-
tum Phi on Tuesday, May 2, and,
again on Monday, May 8. In the
aftermath of controversy sur-

‘rounding the Gallagher. inci-
dent, I would like to set forth my

statements as to the relevant
issues presented, and make,

| clear my position as to those
_ issues, ’ 3

, My decision to vote to over- :
_ rule the Pub. Board’s dismissal

:

_is ‘neither ‘an expression of
‘ agreement with. nor: condoning
of, Mr,. Gallagher’s, conduct

regarding the issuancé of the
Rank-Tam Poon. My vote to
overrule reflected my ‘opinion
that a dismissal was not war-
ranted in light of the informa-
tion presented: to the EC.
However, it is my feeling that
the issues raised during the
dismissal hearing are vitally
important, and demand further

“ consideration and discussion.

As with the extension of any

  
   
     
   
       

right or privilege, ‘‘freedom of
the press” is necessarily ac-
companied by certain respon-
sibilities. When a right is well
protected and jealously guard-
ed as press freedom, those who
claim its privileges have an
even greater responsibility to
exercise sound judgment and
well reasoned policy commen-
surate with those highly valued
privileges. The editor of a
school paper reaches a wide
and essentially captive au-
dience. The ramifications of
such control over the reader-
ship and over the news-
gathering and _ news-
disseminating activities of the
university community further
underscores the responsibile
position of the newspaper and
those who shape its policies.

The editor of the school paper

_ is not an elected official. The

student body does not exercise
its will through his appoint-
ment. Therefore as a decision
maker, the editor must
recognize the scope of his in-
fluence and temper it with sen-
sitivity and deference to those
authoritative bodies elected and
appointed to express the will of
the student body. He must also
recognize that his status as a
non-elected official further rein-
forces his duty of résponsibility
to those for whom he provides a
service, and from whom he
receives the opportunity to pro-
videthatservice.'° |

be allowed to be said that the
editor of W&L’s newspaper can
simply print whatever he so
desires. If that is the prevailing
attitude, it blindly disregards
the rigorous demands of ac-
countability, good judgment,
and integrity which an_in-
dividual entrusted with public
responsibility must
wholeheartedly accept. Such
acceptance of responsibility
demands careful weighing of
the consequences of one’s ac-
tions, regard for the best in-
terests of the community,
respect for journalistic integri-
ty, and perhaps most im-
portantly the realization that an
executive decisional follows an
established procedural process
designed to protect against
abuses inherent in solitary
power. Such a decision is far
more than an_ impulsive,
headstrong leap in whatever
direction an editor pleases. To
allow a single individual to
justify unbridled, unprincipled
actions by broadly asserting
“freedom of the press”, is to
provide wholesale license to ir-
responsiblity, and to abandon
the demands for accountability,
responsibility, and ethical con- .
duct which a student body must
rightfully demand of its
leaders. nee

Letters to Editor

To the editor:

Here is a letter to mom that
appeared in the Duke Chronical
years ago, with a few changes;

Dear Mom,

Very soon the undersigned
will once again be in your
midst, debauched, demoraliz-
ed, deflated, and delirious,
ready to take his place once
again as a human being with
freedom and justice for all,
engaged in life, liberty, and the
somewhat related pursuit of
happiness.

In your joyous preparation to
welcome him, you must make
allowances for the crude en-
vironment that has been his
home. He may be somewhat
grit, suffering from advanced
stages of intermuralitis, exam
cramming slump, and sand-
bags under the eyes, as well as
lacrosse fever and_ tubing
bruises, and must be handled
with care.

Show no alarm if he prefers to
squat rather than sit on a chair,
pads around the house in thong
sandals and a towel, takes
showers in the raw in the front
‘yard, slyly offers to sell dope to
the neighbors (for a profit of
course), craves cold drinks,
leaves plates and glasses in his
room until they mold, picks
suspiciously at his food as if you
were trying to poison him, and
gripes because the butter is
hard instead of soft and runny.

Be tolerant when he tries to
buy everything with his meal
card, accuses relatives of steal-
ing his Playboy pin-ups, and
refuses to enter a stranger’s
house without a half dozen
fraternity brothers to back him
up.

He may complain about
sleeping on a soft mattress, but
if he does, throw a raincoat
where the ants are the heaviest
and he will be happy.

In his first weeks at home, be
sure to leave the telephone off
the hook between dusk and
dawn. Should it happen to ring
during the night he might stag-
ger out of bed, shocking the
neighbors with violent profanity
while fumbling through his
belongings looking for his half-
filled fifth of vodka, and then
charging out of his room with a
handful of shoes, flinging them
at anything that moves,
shouting, “Dammit, I’ve gotta
test at 8:00!’ He may then
disappear for a few days (if you
have no commons room, check
the basement).

Show no alarm if he cries in
terror at the sight of roast beef,
pancakes, and pork roast, or
stares in wonder at ice cubes
floating in a glass. Don’t. worry
if he drinks beer with every
meal, pours gravy on his
dessert, or mixes peaches with
his macaroni.

With a little luck, his profani-
ty will soon decrease enough to
permit him to associate with
mixed groups, and not too long
afterward he should be speak-
ing as well as ever.

For the first few months be
extremely watchful when he is
around girls. Coming from
Washington and Lee, his first
reaction upon meeting one
might be to stare, pant, drool,
or faint, depending upon his
capacity for shock. A steel leash
is recommended.

Keep close watch. Keep in
mind that beneath his tanned,
beaten, dusty, and rugged ex-
terior there beats a heart of
gold. Treasure this, for it is the
only thing of value he has left.
Treat him with love, tolerance,
understanding, and an occa-
sional gallon of ice cream.

When you hear him muttering
to himself in the quiet of a home
town evening, respect his
solitude. If you hear him talking
of a road trip, get the car ready.
In either case, have faith in his
ability to return to the civilized
world.

So dust off the stereo and fill
the refrigerator with beer
because the ‘‘kid” is coming
home.

Hit by Rock

Editor
Ring-tum Phi

I am enclosing a letter sent to
the Executive Committee con-
cerning a head injury I received
at W&L. It has come to my at-
tention that the same sort of ac-
cident occurred three years ago
in the Freshman Quad, where a
student was hit by a falling
brick. Will a third ‘‘accident’’
have to occur before something
is done?

My accident was not major. I
lost a lot of blood but was only
stunned and required only one
stitch. However, I was lucky it
wasn’t worse! I’m writing you
in the hope that by publishing
this letter such negligence
(securing political banners over
entryways with bricks) will be
probibited in the future.

I do not seek to single out Rob
Benfield in particular, although
his banner provided the brick.
There were many other banners
waving in the wind. He has
already offered to pay the
hospital emergency expenses. I
hope as President of the EC, he
will initiate legislation against
such negligence.

Yours sincerely,
E.P. Claar

Executive Committee
Washington and Lee University
Dear Sirs:

On March 29, 1978 a brick
securing the banner of a ‘“‘Rob
Benfield”’ above the student Co-
op Building fell and smashed
me on the forehead.

I am writing this letter for
two purposes: first, to assure
that such obvious stupidity does
not occur in the future, for the
welfare of other individuals and
secondly, to. received
remuneration. The use of bricks
to hold down banners above
well frequented entryways
combined with the wind in the
Shenandoah Valley add up to a
fairly high probability of so-
meone getting hit. Given such
high probability of potential
danger, this ludicrous means of
posting campaign adver-
tisements should be prohibited.

I will send the _ hospital
emergency room bill and doctor
bill to you when they arrive. I
am sure that you will take care
of these compensatory
damages for me. Thank you.

Yours sincerely,
Elaine P. Claar

WLUR editorial

“Aired on WLUR May 10
as an editorial”’

In case anyone missed the
news Tuesday morning, the
Ring-tum Phi controversy is
finally over. In an 8-4 vote, the
Executive Committee voted for
a second time to retain Mike
Gallagher as editor of the Ring-
tum Phi. The ruling reversed a
Publications Board decision
which had dismissed the editor.
The second vote was necessary
as a constitutional requirement
and now the paper can — for
three more issues at least —
return to its old cantankerous
self.

The latest chapter in this saga
should come as no surprise,.
Despite it’s constitutional
necessity, it carried as much
punch as a ruling that the
Dallas Cowboys were world
champions two weeks after they
won the Super Bowl. Nobody
cares in either case — yet Mon-
day’s meeting was _ duly
reported py the local press.

It may serve a purpose —

albeit a small one — to flog this
long-dead horse one more time
for an obituary of the affir. The
whole controversy was, despite
all of the glowering phrases of
principle and freedom of the
press, no more than a tempest
in a teapot.
There were no winners in the
end, only losers. To build a poor
simile, it is like the Boy Scout
troop who happened upon a
skunk. No one was responsible
for what ensued, but no one
escaped smelling very clean
either.

Despite claims to the con-
trary, few in the journalism
department ever believed that
freedom of the press was an
issue in the affair. Yet Mr.
Gallagher, a math major, made
it a point that journalists were
rallying to his cause. In a show
aired on this station, two pro-
fessors expressed the opinion

 

that Mr. Gallagher was overdo-
jing the case.

Turning Point

(continued from page 3)
The director, Herbert Ross,

fails to do anything with the’

camera or the actors that you
haven’t seen a thousand times.
With the dancers, however, he
— the taste to just let the film
roll.

“The Turning Point’ was
nominated for 11 Oscars and
won none, like its siamese twin,
“Julia,” the big losers of the
year! Forget it. All you big
studs, so proud of your manly
gait — go enjoy enjoy an athlete
in his prime. Feel free to cheer.

Of course he was. And I would
have done the same thing. Spur-
red on by one tactical blunder
after another by parties involv-
ed, the mess was a spectacle
P.T. Barnum would have been
proud of. .

The ‘‘Rank-Tam Poon”’ edi-
tion of the paper was bathroom
humor at best and only mildly
amusing. The University acted
within its power in refusing to
allow it to be mailed out under
its postal permit. And the paper
was never censored, or con-
fiscated, as has been claimed.

But the University did over-
react in its attitudes and actions
following the beginning of the
affair. Their defensiveness pro-
bably initially blew it out of pro-
portion.

Mainly, the press is at fault
for the spectacle, for it fell into
a trap for which it is criticized
all too often: it generated more

‘news than was actually there,
and snowballed a small event
into a larger one. Mr. Gallagher
may be at fault here, as he has
admitted talking to the news
media to make sure the affair
got its coverage. Maybe the
event should have _ been
covered, but surely not as
grandly as was the case. There
is also something disconcerting
about Gallagher as a partici-
pant also being the link to the
press.

However, he had much to
gain by doing this, as he did
with the posters and bumper
stickers posted around campus
for him. There is no doubt these
were responsible for the large
turnout at the Pub _ board
meeting and the initial E.C.
meeting.

I also must confess some pre-
judice in this respect —as the
only news representative at the
second pub board meeting, I
gleefully reported it to the
papers, only to be later rejected
as a “p.r. flak.’”’ At the same
time, Mr. Gallagher, hardly an

Phi returns to its “old
cantankerous self”

impartial observer, was talking
to another paper, giving them
the story.

I was also in the same situa-
tion at the final E.C. meeting. I
did not consider it worthy
enough to feed to anyone. And
one E.C. member has said that
Gallagher told him that he
wanted to let the issue lie and
receive no more publicity. Yet
the story was in the papers
yesterday morning. How did it
get there?

Now that it is over, I will
neither condemn or applaud the
outcome. I remarked to the
Publications board at their se-
cond meeting that they were lit-
tle more than a lynch mob. Yet
the initial pub board meeting
was also a lynch mob with
Gallagher supporters. The
reasoning behind Gallagher’s
dismissal were basically sound.
But the board decision was one
of grossly bad timing, and that
is why they were defeated.

It was also amusing to hear
the arguments of precedence in
the final meeting. E.C. presi-
dent Jim Underhill was correct
in his statement that there is no
precedent being set and that
this will only be a fuzzy issue in
a couple of years. After all, who
remembers the reasons behind
the Great Spinners war of a
number of years ago? Was
there an urgent precedent set
there? .

Finally, all parties involved
should think twice about dragg-
ing in such ideas and words as
freedom of the press and using
it as loosely as it was used.
There was never any question
of freedom of the press in this
affair, never any danger of cen-
sorship. Freedom of the press is
important, of course, but used
in the wrong context, or as a
hiding spot, only erodes a
credibility the press has with
the public which is on shaky
enough ground anyway.....

The “Dig” uncovered

by Ned McDonnel

On a bluff behind the colon-
nade, behind the sports
stadium, and surrounded by
sweating, but constantly
dedicated workers, stands two
walls on either side of a high
reaching tree. These walls, the
only two substantive markers of
a structure long outlived in its
utility but still standing for the
history of two centuries past,
constitute structure number
two. Structure what? All this
smacks ofThe Charriots of the
Gods. But structure number
two is merely the code name of
the last standing ruins of Liber-
ty Hall used by the members of
the ‘‘dig” (a nickname for the
Liberty Hall Academy Ar-
chaeological Project).

Although the dig, as an ar-
chaeological enterprise has
gained respect throughout
Virginia, just what are the cir-
cumstances behind this
achievement? First, Liberty
Hall stands for an academy,
founded originally as Augusta
Academy by some
Presbyterian ministers in 1749
about seven miles north of what
is now Lexington. William
Graham took over in 1776 (the
name change bearing the evi-
dent patriotic fervor rampant in
the British segment of the New
World at that time). The
original Liberty Hall, standing
at Timber Ridge, closed in the
early 1780s, but Graham with a
few hard core students and a
farm in Lexington, sought to
rebuild Liberty Hall. In 1792, or
perhaps a few years before,
Graham hired an undertaker (a
colonial expression for a
building contractor) to con-
struct the new campus at the
present location of the ruins.
From it arose Liberty Hall itself
which closely resembled
Nassau Hall on the campus of
the nation’s first Presbyterian
college, Princeton. Several
other buildings, intrinsic to the
establishment of a functional
eighteenth century seminary or
college, were also erected by
the same undertaker.

From this morsel of history
emerges the story of the dig.
The ruins and subterranean
foundations passed unnoticed
for more than a century and a
half. But in 1973, Washington
and Lee archaeologist Dr. John
McDaniel began to initiate the
idea of a dig. The University,
endorsed the idea. John Arm-
strong (’77) Liberty Hall
scholar and second in command
for the 1978 season elucidated
the conception of the dig by say-
ing, ‘“Through the herculean ef-
forts of John McDaniel and the
good graces of the University,
the project has obtained a
number of grants which have
enabled us to do this research.”
To date the dig, principally
through the tireless efforts of its
instigator Dr. McDaniel, has
raised in excess of ninety thou-
sand dollars of funding from
foundations and_ private,
‘friends of the University’ con-
tributions.

The 1974 season, (a season
usually meaning, in this case, a
particular spring and, possibly
summer), was productive for
the dig. The premier season in-
cluded a lot of mechanical and

visual surveying. Mechanical
surveying consisted mainly of
“probes” and “‘test pits.” To ex-
ecute a probe, a brawny person,
perhaps a football player,
would drive stakes in the
ground on a consistent pattern
(such as a straight line or a grid
pattern). The depths to which
the stakes could be driven
varied dramatically. These pat-
tern shifts indicated a strong
possibility of the presence of
underground foundations. Test
pits, on the other hand (burrow-
ing several feet into the ground
and being circular with an ap-
proximated two to three foot
diameter) were dug at regular
intervals over the grounds of
the dig (which include a farm
house built fifty years after the
construction of Liberty Hall).
From these mechanical
surveys, two discoveries, that
of structures one and three,
were made. After further
research, structure number one
was hypothesized to be a three
floor steward’s house with
classrooms and dining facilities
on the first floor and living
quarters on the upper two
floors. Researchers establisbed
that structure number three
was a spring house storing
Liberty Hall’s supply of water.

Visual surveys, on the other
hand, sought to locate signify-
ing traits of past construction,
e.g. mounds, rocks protruding
from the ground, and _ir-
regularity in the pattern of
plant growth where the grass
above foundations may have
been dried out prematurely for
a lack of fertile ground due to a
short distance between the sur-
face and the foundations
themselves. The surveys were
greatly enhanced by arial
photographs obtained from
government agencies and a bor-
rowed helicopter. The one
tangible and most obvious
result of the visual appraisals
was wall structure number two
or the ruins of Liberty Hall
itself. These buildings were
erected by the same undertaker
from Rockingham.

A summer season, based on a
program in conjunction with
VMI, started in 1976. Along with
the agenda of the spring ses-
sion, Dr. McDaniel led his crew
to do some research on the Spr-
ing House (structure number
three).

Last spring, along with wrap-
ping up the undertakings of
previous years, the student ar-
chaeologists began working in
the area of the farm house built
in the mid-nineteenth century.
The efforts culminated in the
discovery of a brick kiln, an
oven used for manufacturing
bricks, dating back to the era of
Liberty Hall. Also discovered
were three sets of foundations
hidden until last year in the roll-
ing terrain surrounding the far-

mhouse. One of these founda-
tions dated back to the Liberty
Hall days while the dates of the
other two eluded (and still do)
the archaeologists. The sum-
mer session, under the same
format as the preceding year,
merely followed through on
these findings.

This year, aided by the efforts
of eight honor students in area
high schools and an extraor-
dinary number (about eighty)
of dedicated and hard working
students, the dig is making its
final push to complete the
mechanical and visual surveys,
a goal, Armstrong feels will be
achieved. But this season,
slated to be the last, has made
an unanticipated find in the
woods just behind the ruins of
structure number two. The
foundations, based upon ar-
tifacts found near the sight,
may well be another Liberty
Hall ecstacy. But, as second in
command Armstrong says,
“it’s too early to make any
definite conclusions.” This may
breathe some more life into an
investigation of our college’s
heritage, a heritage that never
really died.

The students who provide the
leadership and sense of direc-
tion necessary for the dig’s con-
tinuing success this year are
Parker Potter, Howard Smith,
Angus Finney, Buddy Bowie,
Jim Adams, Jesse Suber, Gard-
ner Umbarger, and Jim
Fineman. Specializing in dif-
ferent aspects, these young ar-
chaeology enthusiasts have
coordinated the dig to make it a
first rate project.

McDaniel himself observed
that the wealth of labor stems
from the cost effectiveness ($10
per pupil for the course) and the
suitability an intense thirty-
five-hour week holds for the spr-
ing terms. Finally, the result,
the legacy of the dig will be a
well documented book about the
dig, its goals, and its findings
written by the man behind the
dream.
