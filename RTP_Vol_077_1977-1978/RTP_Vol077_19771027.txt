EC retains wages

For publications heads

by David Abrams

The Executive Committee of
Washington and Lee University
voted ‘down a motion to discon-
tinue monetary compensation
for the editors and business
managers of the Ring-tum Phi
andCalyx at Monday night’s
meeting.

Also, a motion to suggest to
faculty members that they
specify exactly how they want
their exams taken, under
Washington and Lee’s indepen-
dent exam system, and
clarification for students of the
independent exam system dur-
ing orientation was passed.

Mike Missal, senior EC
representative, who introduced
the motion to discontinue
salaries, said the constitution of
the Publishing Board authoriz-
ed salaries but this could be
changed by a two-thirds vote of
the EC over two consecutive
meetings.

Ryland Owens, president of
the Publishing Board, said that
students holding these paid
positions receive 22! per cent
of the publications’ yearly pro-
fits and that the Calyx and
Ring-tum Phi were the only
campus organizations that were
largely self-supportive. He said
that taking away the compensa-
tion for these jobs would en-

Twenty Washington and Lee
University students have been
chosen to be included in the
1977-78 edition of Who’s Who
Among Students in American
Universities and Colleges, a
listing of those students con-
sidered to be among the coun-
try’s most outstanding campus
leaders.

Of the twenty students, six
are from the School of Law.

The selections from the
school of Law Include: Mary
Depoy, Rutland, Vt., Phi Beta
Kappa and a staff member of
theLaw Review; David Falck,
Manchester, Conn., Phi Beta

the Student Control Committee
and the University Council;

Rick Goddard, senior law
school representative, said that
the student body was getting a
bargain because it only pays
about 25 per cent of the Phi’s
and Calyx’s operating expenses
and receives in return a weekly
paper throughout the school

Over two thirds of the depart-

retention of independent ex-
ams.

A poll conducted by the Ring-

the 22 department heads would
vote for the retention of in-

of these professors said they
believed their department

Independent exams,

Faculty favors retention

said they would not vote for the
retention of independent ex-
ams, expressed several
dissatisfactions with the pre-
sent system. Chief among their
considerations was the feeling
of faculty members that the
studen.t EC was not acting in
accordance with the initial pro-
mises it made when indepen-
dent exams were initiated. Ac-
cording to several department
heads, the EC has become pro-
gressively more languid in its
duty to assure that no aspects of
exams are discussed by
students. Another complaint

voiced by professors was that .

too often students call them to
make changes in their exam
schedules. Overall, teachers
who are skeptical of the present
system say it places too much
strain on the honor code.

Here are replices from in-
dividual department heads:

Accounting

Professor Cook said that, at
this point, he was not sure how
he would vote on the issue.
However, he did recommend
last spring that the present
system be done away with
because of its strain on the
honor code. Cook saw the main
problem with the present
system as resting with the EC.
He said you have to have a
strong EC, which should be
alert to problems and willing to
act quicly to correct those pro-
blems. Professor Cook did ad-
mit, however, that the faculty
will probably vote to retain in-
dependent exams.

Administration
Professor DeVogt said he
believed the present system
should not be abolished.
However, he did believe the EC
should keep harping on the idea
that no aspects of exams are to

be discussed. DeVogt believes
there are no more violations
under the present system than
under the previous system.

Biology
Professor Starling said he
likes the way things are set up
now, and he did not know of
anyone in his department that
was against the present system.

Chemistry

Professor Wise voiced opi-
nions similar to Professor Starl-
ing, stating he would vote in
favor of retaining independent
exams, and that he did not know
anyone in his department that
was against them.

Classics
Professor Taylor reported
that he was in favor of the pre-
sent system, adding that it
works quite well and that he did
not see necessity for im-
provements.

Economics
Professor Griffith said that he
would vote against the retention
of independent exams if it came
to a faculty vote. He added he
couldn’t speak for the whole
department.

English

Professor Duvall expressed
the opinion that he was neither
strongly in favor of the present
system, nor against it. He
stated he did not like the idea of
independent exams before they
were initiated but now he is us-
ed to it. He added independent
exams are not really more con-
venient for professors.

mented that he does not have

SPE hit with fine

by Lee Howard

Sigma Phi Epsilon president
Mark Danos was fined $10 plus
$13 in court costs Tuesday for
violation of Lexington’s noise
ordinance during Homecoming
weekend.

The past week Phi Gamma
Delta’s president Charlie
Brown was fined a similar
amount for excessive noise
emanating from his fraternity’s
house. Both plead guilty to the
charges.

The noise ordinance, which
carries a maximum penalty of
$1,000 and/or a year in jail, has
been in effect ‘‘for some time,”’
said Danos, but the police have
only started enforcing it this
year. He said he believes city
manager John V. Doane may be

behind the new enforcement
policy. Doane lives almost
directly behind the SPE house
and has been by the house
several times to complain of
loud noise, Danos said.

Danos called the stand-off
between fraternities and towns’
people a ‘‘practical problem.”’
It is hard to have a party and
abide by the ordinance at the
same time, Danos said, Lex-
ington General District Court
Judge Joseph E. Hess was
‘understanding’? when said
Hess it was virtually impossible
to close a party at 11 p.m.,
Danos said. Hess even went so
far as to jokingly suggest that

A Separate Peace;

law library vote

by Jim Ingham

Undergraduate use of the law
library may be restricted in the
near future. Tomorrow law
students vote on either of two
proposals dealing with use of
the law library by non-law
students. An open forum for the
law students will be held tonight
to debate which proposal will be
accepted if either.

In the past, according to Ray-
mond Leven, president of the
Student Bar Association, there
had been no policy concerning
undergraduate use of the law
library. In the _ past,
undergraduates could use the
library if they acted in a respec-
table manner. Lately, however,
some law students have com-
plained about undergrads in the
library, Leven said. He would
not elaborate beyond this.

The two proposals differ in

the amount of restriction placed
upon use of the library. Pro-
posal A makes use of the library
much more restricted. Ac-
cording to this plan, visitors
could only use the library if
their tasks were “related solely
to legal research.”’ At no time
would undergrads be able to use
the SAB Television lounge,
seminar rooms, the upper level,
or any carrel space. To use the
library for legal research a stu-
dent would have to register at
the desk. If an undergrad did
not register and was a general
disturbance, according to the
proposal, he would have to
leave. If he refused, proper
disciplinary action would be
taken by the Student Control
Committee.

Proposal B is a less restric-
tive one as far as the use of the
library goes. Law students and
those engaged in legal research

hoped the opportunity for law
school students and
undergraduates to meet face to
face would alleviate any
animosity the groups might
have for each other.

Although perhaps not totally
successful in this aim (Bill
Tucker, SAB co-chairman said
he didn’t think the two groups
mixed it up very much), the
SAB might at least have ad-
justed some law school at-
titudes toward the SAB. Charlie
Hulfish, also SAB co-chairman,
said many first year law
students think the activities put
on by his organization are only
for undergraduates. He said he
thought the Lewis Hall party
was a good way to publicize the
fact that the SAB works for all
Washington and Lee students.

One SAB member, however,
candidly admitted the SAB was
trying to make a point; the SAB
‘does provide entertainment for
the law school too. Law school
representatives submitted the
opinion during budget hearings
that very few SAB functions are
geared toward law students to
bolster their contention that the
law school should get back 95
per cent of its student activity

Parents will replenish the fort with supplies this weekend.

 

by Jim Parker

According to an informal poll
of the faculty, the general reac-
tion of W&L professors towards
the Executive Committee sum-
mer survey on the honor system
is favorable. Also, the majority
of the faculty members ques-
tioned are in favor of retaining
the independent exam schedule.

The survey consisted of ques-
tions asked to at least one
member in most of the major
departments. Fifteen faculty
members in all were surveyed.
The professors were picked at
random, except for a few
specific faculty members who
have previously expressed opi-
nions concerning independent
exams. An example is Dr. Cook,
an economics professor, who
last year proposed the abolition
of the independent exam
system. Cook’s responses and
those of other faculty members
on certain questions were
revealing.

There was little worth reveal-
ing concerning the general
response of the teachers to the
EC summer survey. All pro-
fessors questioned believed it
worthwhile to take such a
survey, although most of the
professors had only a vague
idea of the survey. One pro-
fessor raised the question of
cost. He felt it was worthwhile if
the survey didn’t cost thousands
of dollars.

Although there were few ob-
jections to having the survey,
there were some concerning the
questions asked and _ the
responses. Several professors
found the questions too general
although a few praised this
quality. One faculty member
thought a question asking what
method students believe could
be used to undercut the indepen-
dent exam system would have
been appropriate. Another
teacher was concerned not with
the response of the 40 odd per
cent who answered the survey,
but the majority who did not.
Responses to the EC poll
varied, but those concerning re-
taining the independent exam
system were more uniform.

Only two faculty members
questioned were opposed to the
independent exam system. The
reasons given for opposing in-
dependent exams were that
they put too much strain on the
students and on the honor
system. Even Dr. Cook said he
supports the system if it can be
strictly enforced by the student
EC. However, he believes this

Faculty praise summer survey

to be impossible year after
year. For the most part, the
faculty’s opinions were not
swayed by the EC survey. One
member was negatively af-
fected by the survey, although
not greatly. Another was less
supportive of the independent
exam schedule before the
survey than after. He said if the
system gives the student a bet-
ter education, it should be re-
tained.

There was some disagree-
ment on whether the present ad-
ministering of the independent
exam system was the proper
method. One professor believed
that there should not be excep-
tions to the rules. For example,
allowing a student to move
around his time for taking a
final exam after it is already
scheduled should not be allow-
ed, he said. The professor sup-
ported either total control or

*non-control, but no middle
ground. Another professor
believed independent exams
couldn’t work unless the EC
toughens up. However, most of

Geology

Professor Spencer said he
thought the present indepen-

abuses. He thought independent
exams were cumbersome to ad-

students should not equate in-

members of his department
would rather see scheduled ex-
ams, provided they didn’t break
the students’ backs.

I had a blind date last
weekend. Well, she wasn’t real-
} ly blind. She could see two feet
} in front of her. At least she had
two feet. I can only imagine how
many feet she thought I had. I
was never allowed to come
within the required distance.
Not that I wanted to. I think she
used a full can of ‘‘Off’’ for a
perfume.

Anyway, there I was with old

may have been eight eyes) sipp-
ing beers in the Cockpit when
}she said “‘Gee!”’ Not that her
ejaculation added anything to
my soliloquy, but at least we
}had made some progress
toward social intercourse. I also
found out that she was not as
thick as the lenses of her
glasses.

what I did. Leaving enough
money on the table to pay for
her cab fare to within 30 miles
of her school, I left. She said
nothing. Maybe she didn’t even
know I was there. Maybe she
was deaf as well as blind.
Maybe she thought I was a gnat.
Maybe I am a gnat. Maybe I am
paranoid. Maybe I should end
here. Maybe not.

They say all great writers

They say love is a “perhaps

Poor, Wretched Oedipus

A RING-TUM PHI COMMENTARY

by John Jacobsen

The current production of
Sophocles’ Oedipus the King at
the Boiler Room Theatre proves
that the word ‘tragedy’ does
not necessarily have to be used
to describe the downfall of a
great man, but it may also be
used to describe the downfall of
a great play.Oedipus is a play of
fate and its tragic effect
depends on the conflict between
the will of the gods and the vain
efforts of human beings
threatened with disaster.
“Resignation to the divine will,
and the perception of one’s own
impotence is the lesson which
the deeply moved spectator is
supposed to learn from the
tragedy.”’ However, if Oedipus
is going to move a modern au-
dience the strength of the pro-
duction must not lie with the
plot as much as it lies with the
peculiar nature in which it is
revealed. As Freud said,
“There must be a voice in us
which is prepared to
acknowledge the compelling
power of fate...’’ and this voice
must be nutured in a production
of Oedipus: we must feel for the
king for his fate might have
been our own!

We rarely feel for the king,
here, however. Warren Mowry,
playing the part of Oedipus,
shares with us only the
shallowest of emotions. We
must feel the contrast between
the Oedipus in the opening

scenes — a man of wealth,
power, and knowledge, ‘‘first of
men” — and the Oedipus

towards the end — an obscure
figure, an incestuous patricide,
“most accursed of men.”’ He
must be strong in the start, in
gestures and movement. His
voice must tell us that he is
helmsman. With Mowry this
comes across only occasionally.
We de not feel the power in his
voice — the power that he
believes what he is saying —
and we do not see in his eyes the
concern for his people. We do
not see it because, perhaps, it is
not there within the actor.

This is another problem with
the production: we see very lit-
tle acting. The Chorus’ lines, for
example, carry little emotion or

the scenes of the crime were
charming in lonely houses
blanketed in the worst blizzard
of the century. The list of
suspects was invariably a rare
old collection of eccentrics all of
whom had excellent reasons for
sending the victim to his unhap-
py reward.

However, when home-grown
products began to appear on the
drug market there was a shift in
the mix of our fix.'‘Why was the
drime committed became more
important than who had done it.
We followed both hunted and

force. There is a great deal of
yelling and the hitting of knees,
but very little hoping and the
punching of lines. We need to
feel the confidence of the
Chorus in Oedipus, the king, in
the beginning before Tiresias’
entrance. A smile. A laugh. A
cheer! Even a little applause
might have shown that there
was at least a minute bit of life
left in Thebes.

Jocasta’s entrance; ironical-
ly enough, does indeed ‘‘come in
the nick of time.” Watching

He is a politician, a calculator:
this part Jim Weatherstone

the role of Tiresias, holds very

The direction, then, by Lee
Kahn, contains many in-

does the Chorus drop into a

Christian overtones to a Greek

clear, crisp, and defined.
Oedipus the King could work

actors are close at hand and
therefore should be easy to feel.

Today it seems as if the best
stuff is again being imported
from overseas. Dutch and
Swedish writers are among
most valued connections, along
with writers like P.D. James

England. Hardline addicts can

In Your Pit—-—

Cockpit Crowds Grow

by Galen Trussell

This is the initial, and
possibly only installment of ‘In
Your Pit’’, so it seems only fit-
ting that you, dear reader,
should realize what I, dear
writer, am attempting to do
with this column. It is not mere-
ly for me to exercise my jour-
nalistic prowess, but more to
report to you the happenings in
the Cockpit and plans for future
events, thereabouts. Here goes:

George Fagan played last
Thursday ngiht to a fair crowd.
Everyone I talked to said he
sounded good, but George
doesn’t agree. He said he needs
more time to work on his
material.

Friday started out featuring
Dominic and John, but evolved
into a loose jam, ending up
featuring Ed Blomquist on
bass, and Pete Davis on guitar.
Their renditions of the Dead
were tight and the crowd didn’t
want to leave at closing time.

THE

Well, without causing too
much of a stir I am going to at-
tempt to do something in this
article that I hope y’all don’t get
too upset about. Remember
everything is fun.

Remember last week when
the article ‘Prepping Out In
Every Way’ appeared in the
Phi, well I thought that it would
be fun to attach a few names to
some of the categories. Well,
here goes:

They didn’t take the pill!

Especially after a wealthy
alumnus, Bill Saunders (Class
of ‘41), bought everyone in the
place a round of beer to the tune
of almost $70.

Saturday even featured a
visiting guest artist from VMI
named Jeff Smith. Jeff played
mostly his own stuff. Again the
crowd approved.

Attendance in the Cockpit
was very good over the
weekend. Dan Scott estimated
that the Pit packed in 300 to 400
each night. Specials on dark
beer never hurt.

In The Works

The University Center Com-

of the Student Music Union
(SMU) is attempting to get
Dave Von Ronk in the Cockpit
this term for at least one night.
Von Ronk does not make many

there is a slim chance he’ll

KNOWS

Donny the rear or flunky list is
brought up by Bobby, Jimmy,
Willie (sounds like the line up
for the Mouseketeers) and Air
and Head. Of course Lee of AD
is about the king of the campus.
The Phi Delt’s use to have a few
of these, but most of them are
gone except for Skoot, Syd, Hal,
Trace and Tift. Certainly not a
bad selection. If only they
wanted to make some money I
could certainly set up an in-
teresting service between the
lonely girls over hear and y’all.

This specific type doesn’t
need to shop at Eljo’s they can
be found in the major cities
where Brooks Brothers have
their branch stores. Incidently
they wouldn’t be caught dead in
Leroy Worley’s Adair Hutton.

Middle of the Road Prep
seems to be made for the
Pika’s. Pika’s don’t fool around.
They know they’re studs (that is
except for PW, he still has not
figured out why he lost the EC
election.) Nash, Sip, Dew, Cliff
and Wally head the list here
almost rivaling their nighbors.
At the other end is HK. Well, we
could write a whole story on
him. Some other frats try and
get in this category but few suc-
ceed. The X’s, Beta’s, Pi Kapp’s
and Delt’s are just a few.

Hard Core Preps: well only a
few, but they must be mention-
ed. At the Phi Kapp house we
have AB who heads the list and
the rest of the house to follow,
Botts is co-chairman with AB.
The X’s hit this one real hard
with half their fhouse falling in-
to this cat. MP, BC, KL, CT,
MM, RS, and of course
veryones favorite Jack the Rip-
per. Tacky Prep hits the Beta’s
at full force. Plater leads the
list (sandals with socks, really
now). Honestly, I don’t think
those boys ever saw an iron in
their life. And who says your
pants have to come to the mid-
dle of your calf and stop.

Obnoxious Prep: you

Soccer Team To Play
In VISA Tournament

by Chris Fay

The W&L soccer team has
made it to the Virginia playoffs,
for the first time since 1968. On
Monday, Nov. 7, the team will
host University of Virginia.

Head soccer coach Rolp Pira-
nian is understandably pleased
with making the playoffs and so
are the players. Piranian refer-
red to the honor as one more
feather in the W&L soccer cap.
Other accomplishments of the
team this year have been winn-
ing the Virginia Wesleyan Tour-
nament and being the ODAC
Champs.

The team will have busy days
ahead. They have 7 games in 18
days. Including a _ regular
season game against UVa on
Friday. Woever wins the first
game between the two teams
will have a big mental ad-
vantage in the playoff game.

As of yet Piranian has nothing
special cooked up for UVa. He
continues to take the games a
day at a time.

Last Saturday the Generals
played VMI. The players from
VMI marred an_ otherwise
beautiful day by beating the
Generals and, as they say in the
military trade, by decomission-
ing Mark Turner.

In the opening minutes of the
game VMI scored the only goal.
Homer Bliss, the W&L sweeper
fullback, was by the edge of the
18 yard box ready to trap an in-
coming, bouncing ball. Mark

Bolstered by the best defen-
sive effort of the season and an
uncorked offense which rolled
up 270 yards on the ground, the
Generals rumbled to their first
win in seven games, conquering
“the Mountain” and the Univer-
sity of the South 21-14.

Stu Atkinson’s one yard

- plunge with 41 seconds left in

the game capped a 66 yard, 9
play drive, providing the
margin of victory and had a
dampening effect on the spirits
of Sewanee’s homecoming
crowd.

Enjoying one of the best after-
noons of his career, Atkinson
provided much of the spark,
carrying the ball 16 yimes for

Tennis Team Takes Fourth
In First W&L Tournament

by Jim Barnes

Washington and Lee conclud-
ed its fall tennis program last
weekend as well as its first in-
vitational tournament on a less
than optimistic note last
weekend. With the Universities
of Virginia, Maryland, and Ohio
in attendance, the competion
was too tough for the Generals
to finish any higher than fourth
out of four. That’s not to say
that the team was completely
outclassed by the visitors. The
netters had their chances, par-
ticularly against Ohio and
Maryland, but their inex-
periance became apparent in
the close matches.

On Friday the team faced
Virginia in the opening match
as Maryland played Ohio at the
VMI tennis courts. The
Generals managed a meager
improvement in the team score
over last year’s confrontation
with the Cavaliers, as Captain
Ben Johns and sophmore
Stewart Jackson took Hank
Harris and Jim Hilmer at the
number one doubles’ spot, 6-1,
6-4. Last year the team was
blitzed by UVA 9-0. Johns and
Jackson provided the only win
of the day as the team lost 8-1.
At the number one. singles

Johns played a great match ina
losing effort 3-6, 7-5, 5-7, to
Virginia’s Hank Harris.

W&L’s second match with
Ohio was the closest. Of all the
matches the Generals played,
this one had the most promise of
vi ctory. Johns defeated Jim
Asher, 6-2, 6-1. Jackson lost a
elose match to Tony Torlina,
7-6(5-0), 6-4, at the number two
spot. Freshman Cody Davis
gave the Generals their only
other win in singles, defeating
the number three player from
Ohio, David Mossoiah, 7-5, 6-2.
Sophmore David Constine and
freshmen Robert Schuler and
Doug Gaker all lost their
respeetive four, five, and six
singles matches. In doubles
Division III’s best, Johns and
Jackson, defeated Mossoiah
and Opperlander, at the
number one doubles position,
6-4, 6-0. Sophmore Pat Norris
teamed with Davis. Davis and
Norris dropped the first set 1-6.
They struggled back to win the
second set 6-4, but saw their
comeback halted by Asher and
Torlina, 6-4 in the third set. Con-
stine and Schuler’s match
followed a similar patter, only
the scores were 7-5, 5-7, 6-3,
Ohio.

It is at doubles that the
Generals sorely miss
Makepeace and Keesler, last
year’s four and five lettermen,
who will be abroad this Spring
term in Europe. Last year W&L
fielded three strong doubles
teams with Constine sitting out
in lieu of Norris at the number
two doubles spot with last
year’s Captain, senior Ken
Voelker. At this point it does
not seem that these players will
be as successful as their team-
mates were.

Later in the afternoon the net-
ters faced their final opponent
of the tournament, the Ter-
rapins of Maryland, Once again
Davis captured a victory at his
number three spot, crushing
John Olson, 6-2, 6. Gaker
defeated the Terp’s Ron
Schaub, 6-3, 6-3, for the only
other W&L singles’ win. Davis
and Norris defeated Olson and
Joe Garber at the number two
doubles spot 7-6(5-0), 6-2. The
Terps won the rest and the
match 6-3. The final standings
in the tournament were:
Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, and
W&L.

Personel-wise Cody Davis
was the brightest spot on the

(continued on, page 7)

118 yards. Freshman Karl
Cheatham added 87 yards on 18
carries to give the Generals
their best balanced backfield

attack of the year.

The third ace of the W&L
backfield, Scott McLam opened
the scoring by taking a Ted
Hissey pass, and dodging his
way 38 yards for a score capp-
ing a 72 yard drive. Cheatham
crashed in from 8 yards out with
49 second left in the first
quarter to top off a 77 yard drive
that provided the Generals with

a 14-0lead.

Sewanee stormed back
amassing mostof its 261 total
first half yards in the second
quarter as quarterback Tom
Clark hit receivers Joe Shults

and Malloy Nimochs on scoring’
strikes of 18 and 38 yards
respectively tying the game at
14 all going into the intermis-

sion.

But the Generals would not be
intimated by the mountain nor
its men as they emerged confi-
dent and ready to play their

best defense of the year.

Spearheaded by sophomore

tackle Jamie Ryan (9 tackles, 1

assist), W&L allowed only 46
yards total offense in the second

half as the Tigers showed a

streak of pink in their purple

jerseys. This is not to say the

defense played poorly in the
first half—quite the contrary. In
fact, the Big “‘D: preserved the
Generals’ 14-0 first quarter
lead, making Sewanee turn the
ball over on downs on three oc-
casions while inside the W&L

thirty yard line.
The front four of Greg Lilly,

Ken Smith, Ryan and Joe
Wallace shut down the Sewanee

running attack enabling the

linebacking trio of  slatcoff,

Folcik, and Ballantyne time to
get good pass drops to thwart

the Tigers’ passing attack.

The secondary palyed its best
game of the season as Sewanee
put the ball up on 40 of 73 plays

Football Team Scores
First Victory of Season

completing only 17 passes,
three of which went to W&L
defenders Crossley, McGowan
and Norberg. The last intercep-
tion ended all Sewanee hopes of
a comeback as it came with on-
ly 21 seconds left.

W&L had a chance to salt the
game away in the third quarter
with a first and goal on the
Sewanee four yard line, but
were unable to punch it in. A
spectacular punt return of 82
yards by Norberg was nullified
with two and a half minutes re-
maining in the third quarter on
a questionable holding penalty.

Syd Farrar denied the Tigers
good field position much of the
day as he averaged almost 42
yards a punt.

Finally, with five minutes re-
maining in the game, the
Generals mounted the final
drive of the game culminating
in Atkinson’s score. Freshman
Dave Edward’s first PAT of his
collegiate career capped the
scoring for the day, final W&L
21—Sewanee 14.

The Generals’ first victory of
the year is even more im-
pressive when considering the
locality of the game. The clear
skies and warm temperatures
of Sewanee, Tennessee, _in-
evitably betrays the true
atmosphere—that of hell. As
Coach Williams is fond of say-
ing, ‘‘“God was mistaken when
he said hell was down.”’

Climbing the famous ‘‘Moun-
tain” seems pleasant until the
stare of Johnny Majors dad,
Shirley one that could stop a
herd of stampeding rhinos,
meet the trepassing visitors.
The referees are about as un-
biased as Lester Maddox (13
penalties vs. W&L) and seem to
revel in trying to verbally in-
timidate the opposition.

Thus this all provides the ic-
ing on the cake as the Generals
not only had to play well to
win—they had to play excep-

Following Tuesday’s semi-

for the I. M. Football crown.

The Phi Kapps won a convinc-
ing victory over SAE by a score
of 31-6 Tuesday. The game was
originally scheduled for Mon-
day, but was postponed.

Law 2 met victory in a hard
fought game against Law 3 on
Monday. The: score was 12-7,
with Law 2 scoring on
touchdown passes by John Mur-
phy to Brick Brown and Rick
Muser.

In the quarter-final round,
Law 2 beat Delta Tau Delta in
overtime. The Law 2 team ac-
cummulated more yardage in
one set of downs than the Delts,
thus gaining a semi-final spot.

Law 3 beat the Fiji’s in their

Tennis

Bussard’s Cuts, a group of in-
dependents who at one time or
another were cut from coach
Dennis Bussard’s tennis team,
were beaten by a group of se-
cond year law students Tuesday
afternoon.

Both teams entered Tues-
day’s contest with identical 7-0
records. The law school was
coming off a win over a strong
Sigma Chi team, including
former varsity letterman A. O.
Smith. Smith was the only per-
son to win for Sigma Chi,
however, as his team went
down in defeat 2-1.

Bussard’s Cuts got to the
finals by beating Pi Kappa Phi
on Monday, also by a score of
2-1. Two of Pi Phi’s players did
not show up for the match.
Number one player for the in-
dependents, Lee Howard beat

Bennett, the W&L goalie, called
for the ball. Bennett caught it,
but a charging Keydet headed
the ball from Bennett’s hands.
The Keydet finished the play by
pooping the ball into the net.

Later in the first half Mark
Turner, in a heroic attempt,
was taken off the field with a
separated shoulder. As Turner
described it, he went up for a
head ball against the VMI
goalie. The goalie got the ball
and as he came down landed on:

player Mike Farrand lost 10-7.
It was up to the doubles com-
bination of Howard and Jim
Barnes to clinch a spot in the
finals by beating their op-
ponents 10-2.

On Tuesday Howard, news
editor of the Ring-tum Phi, was
the only undergraduate to win.
He beat his opponent 10-6.
Meanwhile, no. 2 man Ted Ghiz
lost to an overpowering Kevin
Cosgrove 10-3, while the law
school’s doubles combination of
Scott McCandles and Tack Ed-
dy were devastating in beating

previously undefeated Mark
Mitchell and Barnes.

“The thing that was
devastating about the law

school team is that they were all
equal in talent,” said Howard,
mentioned along with Smith
and Rex Nyquist as a possible
Most Valuable Player can-
didate. ‘‘Their doubles players
were just about as good as their
number one player,”’ he said.

Barnes, sports editor of the
Phi, concurred. ‘They were
just too good,”’ he said. ‘‘Solid
net games, great returns of
serve and good overheads,’’ he
sighed.

substituted for Todd Tyson, the
starting center forward.

W&L dropped another home
game to Hampden-Sydney by a
1-0 score. Hot goaltending was
also the Generals’ downfall in
this as they handily out shot
both H-Sc as they did VMI, only
to come up scoreless. The H-SC
defeat completed the Generals’
season at 2-2.

The Generals out played VMI
but couldn’t score. Their shots
were often wide of the net. The
VMI goalie mjst be given credit
for doing a fine job in stopping
the shots that were on goal.
Jamie Small from Virginia
Beach summed up the game,
“W&L definitely out played
VMI. They just had a few
breaks.”

As coach Rolf Piranian put it,
‘‘We didn’t lose, we just ran out
of time.’’ Roanoke defeated
Hampden-Sydney 3-1 last Satur-
day putting the Generals into
the VISA state playoffs as
champions of the VISA Western
Division II. Sometime between
November 5th and 12th, W&L
will host Virginia, the champ of
Western Division I, and
Christopher Newport (Eastern
Div. II) will host William &
Mary (Eastern Div. I). The two
winners will meet to determine
the 1977 state champion. Lyn-
chburg, although defending
state champ and ODAC champ,
will not defend it’s crown due to
it’s earlier loss to Virginia.

The JV soccer team defeated

clay court player, is adapting
faster than was expected to the
fast surface courts at W&L. It’s
tough for a freshman to fill the
spot of a experianced veteran
on the team, but if this
weekend’s results are any in-
dication of the spring’s, then
Davis is more than equal to the
task. Most of W&L’s opponents
this spring are of equal caliber
to the teams that played in this
tournament, so things won’t get
any eaisier.

A special thanks should go to
Tack Eddy, tournament direc-
tor and second year law stu-
dent, as well as to John Em-
bree, who scouted W&L’s up-
comming opponents as_ they
played at VMI. Some seniors

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

While many students probably are not aware of the
severity of the situation, the faculty will decide next
week the outcome of a very crucial debate—whether
or not to keep the independent exam system.

Many of the faculty have serious doubts concerning
whether the independent exam system puts a strain
on the honor system. These doubts seem to be
strengthened by the increased and more open cases of
cheating and stealing evident in recent years. When
students’ course books (as well as their class notes)
are being stolen from crowded areas such as the
library, dining hall and co-op, there is little wonder.
people are beginning to worry about the honor
system. In its search for ways to save the honor
system, the faculty may very well throw out the in-
dependent exam system.

Why” According to some taculty members
students have taken exams in rooms other than the
designated ones; students have taken exams in Mc-
Cormick Library; students taking an exam in an
earlier period have given helpful information to
students taking the same exam in a later period. Yet,
the faculty turns in very few of the suspected viola-
tions because they have had little confidence in the
student Executive Committee.

The faculty has not really understood what con-
stitutes a violation of the independent exam system
because past EC’s have not made it clear. This year’s
EC is attempting to do so.

Granted, some changes must be made to strengthen
our honor system, but getting rid of independent ex-
ams would do more harm than good. Independent ex-
ams are a fringe benefit of the honor system. Because
of the honor system, we can enjoy such privileges as
independent exams, along with supposedly being able
to leave our books and belongings anywhere on cam-
pus without the fear of their being taken. If one of
these privileges are taken away, then the value of the
honor system will be diminished. In fact, the need of
an honor system at Washington and Lee will become
suspect, because their vote will be construed to mean
that an effective one doesn’t exist.

For most of the students at Washington and Lee, the
honor system works. Most of the students were
gentlemen before they came here and the honor
system is only a reinforcement of and proof that a
special set of ideals is common to this campus. Viola-
tions occur and will continue to occur as long as this
University is attended by human beings. As one ad-
ministration official put it, ““The mere fact that there
is a need for an honor system should tell us dishonesty
exists and will continue to exist.”

Independent exams are relatively new, being in-
corporated into the honor system in the early ‘70’s.
The honor system did exist in the past without in-
dependent exams, but it is doubtful whether it could
continue now without them. To the present body of
students, independent exams are as integral a part of
the honor system as lying, cheating and stealing are
not. They view the honor system as an institution with

_independent exams now one of the corner stones, even
though they were not originally so. To remove that

- assumed cornerstone would put the whole venerable
insitution in danger of crumbling.

The honor system with independent exams is ob-

-viously not a perfect system. Violations occur. In-
dependent exams may provide a temptation for some
students to cheat, but they are students who would
find some way to cheat if independent exams were
taken away. The blame for the shortcomings of the
honor system cannot be put upon independent exams.
The honor system with or without independent ex-
ams, can be likened to what Winston Churchill once
said about democracy, “It is the worst form of
government to come along up to now—except for
everything else.’’ To the present body, the honor
system with independent exams is the best thing to
come along in a long time, and an honor system
without independent exams will be regarded as
something definitely worse. jm.g.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

Oct. 21, 1977
Dear Sirs:

Earlier this fall an up-
perclassman told me, by way of
encouragement, that the Phi
‘twas really bad last year.”’ It
was a small encouragement. I
would like to offer you, in turn,
some encouragement: some of
your articles are truly in-
teresting. Perhaps if you were
to print only the interesting
ones, you could leap-frog, as it
were, ahead in your improve-
ment process. I notice by your
masthead that you have
assembled an impressive group
of editors. One stratagem I
have seen used by other am-
bitious newspapers is to have
one or two reporters on the
staff, whose task it is to
cultivate reliable sources of in-
teresting information.

The fact that three events oc-
curred on the same night at
W&L was interesting, and I ap-
preciated your story and in-
vestigation. However, I wonder
if it was a bit immodest, after
all, to use an entire column,
especially since it was an acci-
dent and may not happen
again? A modest paragraph or
two bringing this eratorical con-
junction to our attention might
have been more appropriate.

I noticed, also, that there was
a “sleeper” in the same Oc-
tober 20 Phi, lurking in a
clothing store advertisement.
Did any of your other readers
pick this one Up? I refer to the
“synthetic down” coat, a pro-
duct novel to my experience. It
would be very interesting, to
this reader at least, if your
reporters could go to Adair Hut-
ton for the story on the synthetic
ducks that yield these feathers.

Respectfully,
George Planansky

Dear Editor:

I must use this rather inap-
propriate forum to express my
apologies to the Washington and
Lee community in general and
certain faculty members in par-
ticular. The apology stems from
two articles that I wrote earlier

 

this month
Homecoming.

Through inept journalism
practices, I mistated the pro-
cedure of selecting the
Homecoming Queen and I cast
some doubt as to how much the
judges actually work. Ac-
cording to Dr. Shillington, the
work involved in the selection
process is grueling. Also, by
editorializing too much, I
disparaged the long-standing
institution of Homecoming. For
these lacks of discretion, I must
apologize to the W&L com-
munity.

I must apologize to Dr.
Hamer for not listing him and
giving him his due recognition
as a judge. I must apologize to
Dr. Shillington for referring to
his presentation of the
homecoming Queen as planting
‘“‘big wet smackers’’ thus
possibly insulting him. Both
these oversights were uninten-
tional which were due to bad
reporting on the one hand and
inconsiderate overuse of my
authority as a reporter on the
other.

concerning

Regretfully,
Ned McDonnell, ‘80

Oct. 21, 1977
Editor:

In reference to the 10/20 let-
ter of “‘transfer student’ ike
Brown, I have but one observa-
tion: I’m sure that if all those
“hose queens” from our il-
lustrious neighboring schools
saw your letter they would all
come rushing to you because of
your concepts on dating and
girls.

Tranferringly yours,
George Fagan

 

 

Editor’s Note:

Please have all _ editorial
replies and rebuttals typed. It
will assist the staff in getting
your letter published more effi-
ciently and quickly.

 

The Ring-tum Phi will have a
staff meeting today at 7 p.m. in
its office in the student center.
All reporters should be there to
receive assignments. Any other
persons interested in reporting
news or sports are invited to
come. Reporters are needed
badly. If you have time, you can
help.

year and a year book. Both
organizations have money left
over to put in a reserve fund to
improve their services, he said.

The vice president of the
Publication Board, Jeffery
Bird, noted that there was ‘‘a lot
of crap published during the six-
ties” when the editor and
business manager of the Phi
were unpaid.

The motion was voted down
8-3, with one abstension.

Following this vote about 75
per cent of the audience left,
many with conspicuous smiles.

George Griffin, vice president
of the EC, entered the motion to
clarify student and faculty
responsibilities regarding in-
dependent exams. The motion
recommended that exams be
taken in a specified location and
that the faculty require 24-hour
notice from a student wishing to
change an exam time. It also
recommended that someone be
present to pass out and collect
exams.

Goddard suggested that the

EC pass rigid guidelines con-
cerning punctuality in picking
up and returning exams but this
was rejected by the committee
because most members felt this
would encroach on the faculty’s
responsibilities.

The motion was approved by
11 representatives while God-
dard abstained. ‘

In other business it was an-
nounced that at next week’s
meeting two people would be
selected for the Courses and
Degrees Committee, one for the
Student Health Committee and
two for the Library Advisory
Committee.

The EC also announced that
the Board of Trustees will raise
the student activity fee to $45
per year starting in the next
academic year. Underhill said
the fee would have to be raised
to $50 per year in 1980 because
of the Mock Convention. Addi-
tionally, the EC agreed to look
into a proposal by Missal that
EC funds be put into interest
bearing accounts.

Danos said a policeman told
Hess the city and the university

the noise ordinance. Danos said
that, until such time as ‘‘things

that the judge did not indicate

that there is no other practical
way to administer exams under

ded independent exams would
be better if they functioned as
had been initially intended.

Sociology

Professor Kimbrough said he
was basically in favor of the
present system, but that he sees
a degeneration in the main-

ams. He sees a lapse in the
original plan as irresponsibility
on the part of the past few
generations of the EC. He
believes the EC should become
more involved in the physical
oversee of exams, making sure
all established guidelines are
adhered to.

During Monday night’s EC
meeting several EC members
said they thought it was up to
the independent teachers to set
up guidelines for taking exams.

Likewise, it was up to the EC to
make sure the rules surroun-
ding exam-taking were enforc-
ed. Following discussion, the
EC passed a resolution about in-
dependent exams which stated:

1) All exams will be taken
where designated by the pro-
fessor.

2) The individual faculty
members’ should _ specify
penalties for the late submis-
sion of exams.

3) The EC should attempt to
orient students as to uniform
policies surrounding the taking
of exams.

4) If a student wants to
change an exam time he should
notify the teacher not later than
24 hours before he is scheduled
to take it.

The faculty EC will make a
suggestion to the faculty as a
whole whether or not to retain
independent exams at the facul-
ty meeting November 7. The
faculty will then vote on the
Faculty EC suggestion.

the faculty acknowledged sup-
port for the present administer-
ing of exams.

On the question of suspected
cheating on exams, almost all
the faculty had heard second
hand of cases of cheating on ex-
ams. However, only two pro-
fessors had first hand
knowledge of students cheating,
and those were isolated cases.

Finally, all of the faculty
believed there could be an
honor system without indepen-
dent exam, being their reason-
ing on the fact that there was an
honor system at W&L without
independent exams up to 1970.
Also, most professors viewed
the independent exam schedule
as a privilege, not a necessary
part of the honor system.
However, some of the faculty
members asked were of the opi-
nion that the honor system
would be weakened if the in-
dependent exams were not
kept. One professor said it
would make the honor system
at W&L more trival. Another
said that taking away a
privilege like independent ex-
amss would weaken the honor
system in the students’ eyes,
whether or not it truly would be
detrimental to W&L’s honor
code.

The honor code at Washington
and Lee is safe, and will remain
that way for a great while. The
independent exam schedule,
however, is a new addition and
more vulnerable. It appears,
though, that the faculty
members are generally in sup-
port of the independent exam
system and will vote to retain it
in their faculty meeting
November 7th.

fee tax. Although the Executive
Committee gave the lasw school
only about 80 per cent of its stu-
dent activity fee, that still
represented almost a $4,000
gain for the law school com-
pared to the previous academic
year’s allotment. Most of that
$4,000 came at the expense of
the SAB’s budget.

Friday’s party, featuring a
varied selection of popular
tunes and seven kegs of beer,
was sponsored jointly by the
SAB and the Student Bar
Association, the representative
body of the law school. The SAB
paid for 75 per cent of the cost,
while the SAB chipped in 25 per
cent.

Originally, there were sup-

posed to be only five kegs of
beer at the party but the
weather was so good an unex-
pectedly large turnout made the
SAB decide to purchase two
more kegs. One student
estimated that about 200 per-
sons were at the party at one
time or another. SAB.members
had no estimates.

themselves,” said one party-
goer. SAB members cited an
impromptu football game and
frisbee throwing as evidence of
this observation. ‘“‘There was a
carnival atmosphere. It was a
good way to relax after a week
of midterms,” one student said.

only been discussed; nothing
definite has been planned.

 

 

 

 

 

Doctors may have found
the reason that men are more
prone to heart attacks in
early middle age. Researchers
have revealed that many cor-
onary victims suffer from a
hormone imbalance.
