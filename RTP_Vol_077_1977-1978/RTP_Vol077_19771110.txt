E. C. Leaves Parties
Up to Chairmen

by Lee Howard

A proposal which would have
made it an honor violation to
have a party with student funds
without obtaining authorization
from the Executive Committee
was voted down 8-1 Monday
night.

The proposal, submitted by
Rick Goddard, came after the
Ring-tum Phi disclosed the past
week that Contact had a $115
dinner on April 19 at the College
Inn which included 10 to 12 Con-
tact members and some dates.

Goddard called the dinner a
‘‘gross abuse of student
money.” He said former Con-
tact co-chairman John Bruch
and Tom Murphy used their
positions ‘‘to have nice times.”’

Bruch pointed out that Con-
tact does not derive all its funds
for the EC and, therefore, he
said, the EC cannot give Con-
tact a set of directives.

Goddard replied that if the
EC gave Contact money with
the stipulation that it would get
no money if it had a party
without EC approval Contact
would have to follow EC
guidelines.

The most effective argument
Bruch put forth against God-
dard’s proposal was that it took
away a good deal of discretion
from co-chairmen and made the
EC all-powerful. He said Con-
tact co-chairmen have been
“given a good deal of discre-
tion’’ in the past.

Goddard said “This is an
abuse of discretion.’’ Doug
Perkins said he didn’t like the
idea of the EC acting as a

“police force,’’ and was
therefore opposed to Goddard’s
motion.

Jackie Boyden, law represen-
tative, said Goddard's motion
established a ‘‘pattern ot con-
duct” for every organization to
follow, however she was not
sure lack of adherence to God-
dard’s proposal should be made
an honor violation.

Other representatives ex-
pressed the same feelings,
despite the fact that the EC
passed a motion by Goddard in
September that made lack of
adherence to accounting

IFC May Withhold
Contact Funds

by Jim Barnes and Lee Howard

When Contact co-chairman
Walter Granruth appeared
before the Inter Fraternity
Council earlier this year to
solicit funds, he told the IFC
that Contact’s only assets were
those that had been ap-
propriated for it by the EC, IFC
president Steve Mattesky and
IFC secretary Steve Jones have
told the Ring-tum Phi.

Mattesky said that, in light of
the Phi’s revelation last week
that Contact actually had
almost $500 left from the
previous year, there is some
sentiment among the IFC
membership to take away a
portion of the IFC money that
has been earmarked for Con-
tact this year.

Mattesky said he “‘personally
disapproves”’ of Contact parties
and dinners being held without
the IFC, Executive Committee
or parents being informed of
them. He added, ‘‘I think that’s

the feeling of a lot of fraternities
on campus.”

Mattesky said he ‘‘would like
to see stipulations put on the
money that Contact receives
from the IFC.”’ He and Jones
concurred in saying that IFC
money should go strictly for
speakers’ fees.

When questioned as to whom
Contact should be accountable,
Mattesky said he was leery of
giving the power of oversight
solely to the EC. He said, “I
don’t want the EC determining
how the money IFC gives to
Contact is to be spent.’’ Mat-
tesky said he favors some sort
of joint committee of EC and
IFC members which would
decide to either grant or
withhold approval of Contact
parties.

Such a proposal, if put into ef-
fect, would seem to weaken
Contact members’ argument
that no one can tell Contact how
to spend its money because no
one gives Contact all its money.

Independent Exams Remain

by Galen Trussell

The W&L faculty resounding-
ly gave its approval to retain in-
dependent exams in a voice
vote at the faculty meeting held
Monday.

The faculty vote for retention
came after the Faculty EC for-
mulated its recommendation to
retain the independent exam
schedule. The Faculty EC’s
recommendation first became
public at a University Council
meeting held October 24.

The Faculty EC decided to re-
ject the proposal made last
April, “that the independent ex-
amination schedule should be
abolished and the registrar
prepare an examination

schedule for use in the fall term
1977.’’ Instead, after discussing
independent exams with the
Student EC and considering the
results of the Faculty EC’s
questionaire, the Faculty EC
voted to propose to the faculty
that the independent examina-
tion schedule be retained. The
University Council then endors-
ed the Faculty EC recommen-
dation by a vote of 21 to 1.

The questionaire circulated
by Dean Atwood’s office asked
faculty members their feelings
about independent exams. Just
under 100 of the approximately
130 faculty members returned
the questionaires. Only six
questionaires returned showed

These are the members of the Warsaw c hamber Opera Mime Com-
pany, returning for their third visit — by popular d2mand — to the

flatly negative feelings about
the retention of independent ex-
ams. Only six faculty members
stated that they had first hand
knowledge of honor offenses,
and only 22 said they had second
hand Knowledge.

More Noise

The EC and IFC, in combina-
tion, give Contact more than 85
per cent of its budget.

Contact members’ only
recourse would be to claim that
money for dinners is provided
by the 15 per cent of the budget
parents chip in every year.
However, thre is no mention in
the letters sent home to parents
soliciting funds for Contact that
their money could be spent for
dinners or parties for Contact
members. As a matter of fact
the letters specify that Contact
seeks to ‘‘provide your son with
a truly stimulating program” of

speakers. Notes on Contact:

—Granruth said, as quoted in
last week's Ring-tum Phi, that
“the $500 which was held over
was necessary for the operation
of Contact during the summer
and in the fall term before Con-
tact received any funds from
the EC, IFC or parents.
However, in an interview with
assistant university treasurer
Louis Snyder, Snyder said
“there was no activity from
June to September’, in the Con-
tact account.

—Snyder said he was never
informed of the EC’s directive
that all unused Contact funds be
returned to the Central Student
Body Fund. He said all student
organizations’ accounts, except
Contact’s and the Mock Conven-

_ tion’s, are closed at the end of

Pi Phi Summoned

Pi Kappa Phi fraternity presi-
dent M. Gray Coleman was
given a summons for a noise or-
dinance violation on Friday
night at 11:25, Lexington Police
Chief J. A. Kirby has confirm-
ed.

Coleman said the Pi Kapp
summons was the earliest noise
ordinance summons given so
far. Previously, Sigma Phi Ep-
silon and Phi Gamma Delta
fraternities were hit with noise
violations. Pi Kapp was not
warned that its music was too
loud before the summons was
issued, Coleman said.

Coleman explained that Pi
Kapp had a live band in Friday
night and that a door close to
where the band was playing
was left open for a while to
allow cool air to reach the dance
floor. It was apparently during
this time that a neighbor called
the police to complain and that
Pi Kapp was found in violation
of the noise ordinance.

The ordinance states that
after 11 p.m. no music should be

heard more than 50 feet from
the building it emanates

Coleman said he thought tne
police department is under
pressure from someone to en-
force the noise ordinance.

“The police are torn mid-
diemen,’’ Coleman said. He
quoted the policemen who
issued the summons as saying,
“We don't want to bother you
people.’’ They said some of the
fraternity’s neighbors “have
forgotten what it’s like to be
young,’’ Coleman said.

Coleman said he was worried
about neighbors’ change in at-
titude since last year. Previous-
ly, neighbors would call the
fraternity house to ask that the
music be turned down, he said.
Despite quick response to
neighbors'requests in the past,
this year neighbors are com-
plaining directly to the police,
he said

Coleman said he thought the
person who called the police
Friday night made a ‘‘crackpot

University Council’s

role defined

by Randy Smith

The University Council is, at
least on paper, one of the most
important committees of
Washington and Lee. According
to co-chairman Dean John, the
UC has jurisdiction over ‘‘any
issue of policy in non-academic
matters’’ affecting student life.
It is “‘the highest authority”’
governing student affairs, and
sets policy for the Student Con-
trol Committee, the Interfrater-
nity Council and the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

The Student Handbook
describes the purpose of the
University Council as giving the
students ‘‘an involvement in the
University governmental pro-
cess...It serves as an official in-
termediary between students,
faculty and administration.”’ It
is, primarily, ‘“‘an advisory
group” which discusses and
debates proposals initiated by
the students and faculty, and
makes recommendations to the
administration, student govern-
ment and faculty. In its capaci-
ty as an advisory group, the UC
is supposed to provide ‘‘a forum

 

for the exchange of ideas on
critical issues facing the
University.” But recently, its
ability to uncover “critical
issues”’ for discussion has been
seriously questioned.

History

Relations between students
and faculty were turbulent at
colleges throughout the country
in the late 1960’s and early
1970’s. The situation at
Washington and Lee was also
strained, although not as much
as at other schools. A basic lack
of student input into University
policies was a cause for agita-
tion. Students were not involved
in the recuitment program, or,
indeed, in many other actions
affecting university life. In 1969,
the faculty adopted the present
12-12-6 calendar schedule
without consulting with or even
properly notifying the students.
Grievances mounted and pro-
mpted the proposal for a
“university council.”’

Composed of representatives
from the school’s administra-
tion, faculty and student body,

Traveler from Altruria

 

Have fun last weekend? I
did, I think. It was all kind of a
blur after the IFC beerfest Fri-
day night, though. I was at the
Pavillion. Had a date. And forc-
ed lots of beer down her gullet. I
did the same. After that, who
knows?

Let me try to reconstruct this
now. There I was at Zollman’s
in my best button down shirt
and corduroy pants, people dan-
cing, swimming and then pass-
ing out (depending on both their
and my state of ennebriation)
before my eyes. All of a sudden
it was my girl who “hit the
dust.” Shocked, somewhat em-
barassed, yet with that wild
look in my eyes that greets the
word ‘‘opportunity,” I carried
her through the mud and the
driving rain to my car and laid
her gently (oh, so gently) on my
crushed valure back seat.

Driving with maniacal zeal
back to my apartment before it
was too late, I ‘“‘made it’’ with
only minutes to spare. I carried
her up three flights of stairs and
down one (I was drunk too) un-
til I got to my ‘Penthouse
apartment.” After laying her on
the bed, she suddenly woke up.
In the confusion of the moment,
however, I was able to convince
her that her clothes were a sym-
bol of middle class social com-
placency. ‘I’m liberal,’’ she
shrieked as she tore off her
clothes.

Before she changed her mind

and decided it was rather gooa
to be socially complacent, I
threw her clothes out the win-
dow, explaining that I was
checking the wind direction.
This all seemed quite logical to
her until I began throwing my
clothes out the window. I ex-
plained this away, however, by
saying I was afraid her clothes
would be lonely.

The next morning I woke up
and tried to figure out who was
lying beside me. It certainly
couldn’t be the same person
with whom I went to the

to weigh at least 250 pounds. I
couldn’t have been that drunk,
or could I? I still can’t figure
out how a 125 pound weakling
myself could have carried her
up all those stairs, though. I

beerfest. The girl beside me had

ing that
“‘desperate.”’

The worst part of the whole
debacle was, however, having
to take her to the Dining Hall to
eat breakfast Saturday morn-
ing. The checker wanted to ask
Jerry Darrell, the Food Czar,
whether to charge my date for
one meal or two. JD wouldn’t
allow her to eat because the
training meal for the football
team didn’t start until 11
o'clock. Funny, very funny. But
I must admit it was very dif-
ficult explaining it was just a
simple case of mistaken identi-
ty.

the University Council was to
take over the faculty’s respon-
sibility for student and fraterni-
ty conduct. Dormitory rules and
regulations were to be
established by the UC, as well
as aiding in the planning of
freshman orientation week and
the administration of the facul-
ty advisor system. Most im-
portantly, each faculty standing
committee would pass its report
through the new council before
sending them to the faculty
itself. In this way, students
would become aware of faculty
proposals and would have a
chance for comment before the
proposals became policy.

A mechanism for student par-
ticipation had at least been set
up. Although the UC had no
jurisdiction over the Honor
System or curricular affairs, it
could initiate new proposals for
study by the administration and
make recommendations to the
faculty expressing student
desires—an important step for-
ward in the eyes of many. But in
an editorial on December 2,
1970, the Ring-tum Phi warned,
perhaps all too perceptively:
“The possibility for student ‘in-
put’ is present in the proposed
University Council. But we
wonder how many students will
become truly involved in the
future of the university by the
mere creation of a council.”

This Year

By many accounts, the first
meeting of the University Coun-
cil was a long and tedious af-
fair. After senior student
representative John Sacco was
elected co-chairman (with
Dean John), discussion
centered primarily on a pro-
posal which would rotate atten-
dance by faculty represen-
tatives. University professors
are busy men, and their atten-
dance at a monthly meeting
which seems to accomplish lit-
tle was felt, by some, to be an
unnecessary burden on their
time. Sophomore UC represen-
tative Biff Martin, remarked:
“Judging from the format and
topics of discussion of the first
meeting, I can see why pro-
fessors would want to rotate
their responsibility to attend UC
meetings.”

Last Week

This year’s second meeting
was held last Thursday after-
noon. All in attendance were
given a summary of actions
taken by the Faculty Executive
Committee and the Committee
on Courses and Degrees. Atten-
dants, particularly students,
are supposed to quickly read

Nemerov returns to W&L campus for twoda ys.

Noted poet, author to

lecture next week

Howard Nemerov, one of
America’s leading men of let-
ters, will visit Washington and
Lee University for two days
next week. Nov. 14-15

A man highly praised for his
prose, poetry and criticism,
Nemerov will give a_ public
reading of some of his poetry on
Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. in Lee
Chapel.

During his two-day visit,
Nemerov will also meet with a
number of classes at
Washington and Lee, including
modern literature and
American prose classes. He will
also speak to a_ natural
philosophy class in physics
because some of his work has
dealt with scientific . terms and
discoveries.

Severn Duvall, head of
W&L’s English department,
says Nemerov is ‘‘a man of let-
ters in the European sense of
the phrase - a man for whom
letters are a way of life, not just
as a teacher or a poet, but a
creative man. He has an affini-
ty for the tradition of American
verse, like Frost. He is not a dif-
ficult poet.’’

Nemerov is the author of nine
. volumes of verse, five of fiction,
and three of essays. He has won
a number of awards and
fellowships, including a Na-
tional Institute of Arts and Let-
ters grant in 1961, a Gug-
genheim in 1969, and an
Academy of American Poets
fellowship in 1971.

His visit to Washington and
Lee coincides with the publica-

tion of his latest book, ‘“The Col-
lected Poems of Howard
Nemerov.”’ Duvall said it is
unusual for a collection of
poems to be published at this
point in a _ poet’s life, and
reflects Nemerov’s place in the
forefront of American poets.

Nemerov has taught at Benn-
ington, Hamilton, Brandeis and
Minnesota and is currently on
the faculty of Washington
University in St. Louis. In
1963-64 he was the Library of
Congress consultant on poetry.

He has been a frequent visitor
to Washington and Lee, beginn-
ing with the first visit in 1962.
His visits here have been spon-
sored by a number of visiting-
scholar programs including the
Phi Beta Kappa Visiting
Scholar program in 1975.
Nemerov received an honorary
degree from W&L in 1976. .

His visit is sponsored by the
Arthur Graham and Margaret
Glasgow Endowment,
established at W&L in 1960 ‘‘to
promote the art of expression
by pen and tongue.”’

Army chorus to perform Nov. 16

The famed United States Ar-
my Chorus and the United
States Army Brass Quintet will
give a free concert next
Wednesday (Nov. 16) under the
sponsorship of the Rockbridge
Concert-Theatre Series.

The performance will be at
8:15 p.m. in the VMI’s Jackson
Memorial Hall. The public in
Rockbridge County and beyond
is invited to attend at no charge,
whether members of the Con-
cert Series or not, RCTS presi-
dent Leonard E. Jarrard said.

“This is another gift to
residents of the area by this fine
male chorus and by RCTS,”
Jarrard said. ““The Chorus per-
formed here in 1973 and 1974
under the same arrangement,
and I am sure residents will
welcome this third opportunity
to hear and see them.”

The program will consist of
five part songs by Edward
Elgar, three pieces by Francis
Poulenc, ‘“‘A Scotch Mist” ar-
ranged by Gordon Binkerd with
texts by Robert Burns on tradi-
tional Scot airs, and “The
Strong Man,” a cantata on texts
by Carl Sandburg, by M. Sgt.
Thomas Beveridge, _bass-
baritone and a member of the
Chorus.

The Army Brass Quintet, con-
sisting of trumpets, horn, trom-
bone and tuba, will play pieces
by Thomas Beveridge, George
Gershwin, and a suite by More-
ly Calyert.

The Chorus is conducted by
Maj. Allen Crowell, who studied
at Florida State University and
received his Bachelor of Music
degree from  Princeton’s
Westminister Choir College. A
bass soloist, he has appeared
often with such organizations as
Washington’s National Sym-
phony, and the orchestras of

A good time in Lex.?

 

Baltimore, Annapolis and York,
Pa.

The Chorus, established of-
ficially in 1956, has earned an
enviable reputation in the
worlds of serious and popular
music. It has performed in
every major city of the United
States, at many colleges and
universities, from Carnegie
Hall to the President’s State

Dinner for the Apollo 11
astronauts in Los Angeles.
The Chorus feels a particular

responsibility to perform the
great works written specifically

for male voices by the master
composers, but they are equally
at home with popular tunes,
show music, folk songs,
spirituals, and pieces arranged
by their own members.

The remaining programs on
the RCTS 1977-78 season are the
duo-pianists Jeffry and Ronald
Marlowe on Jan. 17 in Jackson
Memorial Hall and Gilbert and
Sullivan’s ‘‘The Pirates of Pen-
zance,”’ performed by the
Manhattan Savoyards, on
March 13 in the Lexington High
School Auditorium.

 

Promising entertainment can be found

by Heartsill Ragon

Entertainment in  Lex-
ington? Never. A couple of
weekend drunks. And, of
course, Fancy Dress. But that’s
about it.

Three years ago, W&L
students might have not believ-
ed Lexington had any ‘hot
spots’.’’ But today, area hot
spots appear to be the current
rage in a town that once might
have been considered Southern
and sleepy and boring.

Clyde Mull, manager of the
College Inn on Main Street, has
said he was one of the forerun-
ners of this current ‘‘night club
syndrome’’ Lexington seems to
be experiencing. With discos
during the week, live bands on
weekends, an occasional play or
two and a new $4,000 giant
television screen, Mull appears
to have tried most of the enter-
tainment angles—at least once.

“IT can’t seem to generate any

interest,’’ Mull laments.
“Students will not pay a cover
charge.”

Mull said he tries to coor-
dinate his social functions and
entertainment to student social
life but added these attempts
have tended to be less than pro-
fitable. He said he’s even gone
so far as to contact fraternity
social chairmen, attempting to
organize some student interest.

Last year, Mull delved into
the disco scene for a limited
time. He reported losing bet-
ween $50 and $150 each night his
deejays played dancing music
‘‘but I’m not quitting,’’ Mull ad-

       

The College Inn’s newest ad-
dition has been a giant, $4,000
television screen. ‘I’m pleased
with it but it’s not bringing peo-
ple in like I’d planned,” Mull
said.

White Column Inn

Elsewhere on Main Street, a
different form of student enter-
tainment can be found. To
many W&L students, the White
Column Inn seems to be the best
place in town for imported beer
and live music.

Paul Buskey, manager of the

WCI, said his restaurant has
been in the music and entertain-
ment business for about a year.
He said it took a good six mon-
ths before the White Column Inn
became established around
town and around campus as an
“in” place to hang out—a place
for good music and good times.
Buskey’s success in booking
bands for their weekly, Wednes-
day night jam sessions lies in
the numerous contacts he has
with area bands. He said bands
are eager to find mid-week
engagements to supplement
their busy weekend schedules

while also supplementing their
weekly income.

He added that because of Lex-.

ington’s close proximity to In-
terstate 81, the area bars can
readily obtain East Coast
talent.

‘“‘Wednesday was just a dead
night in town,’”’ Buskey said.
“Through various connections
we gathered some mountain
music.”

So far, the Wednesday night
entertainment at the White Col-
umn Inn has been reportedly
“very successful.’’ The $1.50
cover charge, page 3 which to
some students might seem
steep, actually is the only pay
the bands at the WCI are paid.
“It’s not very much because it’s
a pretty small place,”’ Buskey
said.

The Good Trencherman

David Waldeck, music coor-
dinator for the Good Trencher-
man, has recently joined the
fastly-moving entertainment
fad. Concentrating on a “well
rounded’ booking schedule,
Waldeck recently booked M.F.
Rattlesnake for the weekend
and crowded 400 people in The
Downstairs for the two night
performances.

The cover charge policy of the
Good Trencherman parallels
that of the White Column Inn:
all gate receipts go to the band.

Waldeck described the
reasoning behind the Trencher-
man’s recent switch to a ‘‘night
club”’ setting as ‘‘an alternative
to a boring weekend.”’

Debaters

receive
awards

by Neil J. Cote

Two Washington and Lee
University students won first-
place trophies in individual
speaking events and the ‘‘A”’
team from Virginia Military In-
stitute finished first in team
competition in a _ series of
debates held at the W&L cam-
pus last weekend.

Five schools: Bridgewater
College, Roanoke College,
United States Naval Academy,
VMI and W&L, competed in the
tournament. The Bridgewater
‘—. -, a. ee 6
finished second, third and
fourth while Navy took fifth
place.

In individual competition,
speakers were put in one of
three catogories: impromptu,
extemperaneous and persua-
sion. Competitors in impromptu
had to speak without rehearsal
while those in extemperaneous
were alotted a half hour to
prepare their topic and were
allowed the use of one note
card. Speakers in persuasion
were allowed to write their
speech before competition, but
were not able to use their notes.

Joseph Cox, a junior at W&L,
took first place in “persuasion”
and his teammate, Alfred
Hintz, a freshman, finished first
in ‘‘extemperaneous.’’ The best
W&L could do in “impromptu”
was junior John Leithead’s
third-place finish.

In team competition, the topic
centered on whether United
States law enforcement agen-
cies should be given significant-
ly greater freedom in the in-
vestigation and/or prosecution
of felony crime. The inex-
perienced W&L debaters beat
Bridgewater ‘‘A”’ and VMI “‘B”
and lost to Bridgewater ‘‘B’’.

Halford Ryan, assistant pro-
fessor of public speaking and
coach of the debate team, says
that this year’s team has had
some trouble in competition due
to their inexperience but should
improve with time. He said that
the rigid academic life of W&L
sometimes limits the prepara-
tion debaters need for tour-
naments. Still, he says that the
young team will be strong in the
future.

A debate against Madison
College is tentatively scheduled
for November 11-i3. On
November 18, W&L will send
students to compete in in-
dividual speaking events at a
debate at George Mason Col-
lege in Fairfax.

NOTICE

Intervarsity is planning an in-
formal get together tomorrow
night in room 114 of the student
center at 7:30 p.m. For those
unfamiliar with I-V, it is a form
of Christian fellowship here at
W&L. Surrounding girls’
schools usually participate in
the meetings. This week’s topic
is “A Time for Sharing.”
Everyone is welcome.

ENTERTAINMENT

 

In Your Pit- - -

by Galen Trussell

Last weekend the Pit featured
only one act, the Buffalo Chip
Band, which appeared Friday
night.

The Chips, composed of Lex
Birney, Ron Spain, Morgan
Simmons and newcomer Peter
Pearl, drew a relatively large
crowd, if you consider the other
activities which went down last
Friday eve. After all, the
Downstairs Bar featured M. F.
Rattlesnake, and how often
does one get a chance to see the
super spectacular stupendous
Shirelles ... YUCK!

Saturday didn’t have any
planned entertainment, but
things got cooking down in the
Pit anyway. You know our
friends next door who wear
those uncomfortable grey suits
with the high collars? Well, it
seems a couple of them imbibed
to a mild excess and were
pleasantly asked to leave by
some upperclassmen. Rumor

has it one of the excessors took
out his frustrations on some
windows.

Again, as always, I must
report that plans for this
weekend are nebulous this early
in the week. All around good
guy Burr Datz has said that he
and some friends will play for
the general student enjoyment
Friday night, but Saturday
again is at a loss. I personally
don’t see any reason to spend
W&L students’ money to pro-
vide Saturday entertainment
for the Vemies.

Coming up .s- The weekend
following this immediate one
will feature Spiritwood, made
up of Lee and Larry Lawson.
Lee and Larry describe their
style as ‘‘music to smile by.”
Their music includes the use of
a wide variety of instruments
and their catalogue of tunes
ranges from blues and rock to

country.

Eye and Ear:

 

To meet an author: to talk
with someone who has combin-
ed words, ideas and feelings in
ways which can send a charge
through us. It is a memorable
event even though we ourselves
are apt to feel unsure of what
say.

From time to time, the
Bookstore has held Coffee-and-
Conversation gatherings with
writers who are visiting W&L.
In the past students have had a
chance to talk with Robert
Lowell, Betty Friedan, James
Dickey and Jimmy Breslin.

Next Monday from 3:30 to
4:30 p.m. the poet Howard
Nemerov, will be in the
Bookstore to have coffee and
chat with students and friends.
The Saturday Review recently
called Howard Nemerov one of
the dozen finest poets in
America. The Collected Poems

from the Bookstore

have just been published this
past week and is what SR calls
‘“‘bonanza of a book.” Allen
Tate, no mean poet himself, has
commented that Nemerewis a

poet who writes in metrical —

verse — in plain style in which
there “‘is nothing ‘poetical’ but
it all adds up to something sub-
tle and profound.” Anyone of
use who has ever tried to write
formally structured poems
knows, agonizingly well, how
hard it is. Mr. Nemerov is a true
master.

Nemerov is an honored alum-
nus of Washington and Lee — he
received a Doctor of Letters at
graduation a few years ago. He
is also an old and good friend of
the school. His visits are always
marked by his genuine interest
in the students, with his gentle
ways in talking of words and
their myriad uses.

 

 

COOOOOOOGOOOM

COOOO0000'

A Bit of the 18th Century
in the Old Troubadour...

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor
The University Theatre is
gaining momentum, as _ it
prepares for the opening night
of its second major presenta-
tion, The Beaux’ Strategem.
Originally produced in 1707, the
play is a fine example of late
Restoration comedy at its best,
and will be directed on the W&L
campus by Prof. Al Gordon,
opening just after Thanksgiv-
ing.

One especially busy man just
now is the scenic designer for
this show, Tom Ziegler. In his
second year on the W&L facul-
ty, Ziegler has already added
great distinction to the Univer-
sity Theatre with such
memorable set designs as those
from Dr. Faustus, Threepenny
Opera, and others.

The designs for an early 18th
century comedy have been
especially interesting and
rewarding for him. Even down
to the show posters and pro-
grams, everything is being done
with an eye toward historical
accuracy.

As Mr. Ziegler puts it, ‘““There
is a lot of ‘fun’ in working with
this show. The set strives to

~-recapture the architecture of

the theatres themselves by br-
inging actual box seats into the
house (see photo this page). We
will plant our own ‘audience’ in
these boxes, acting along with
the play, much in the manner of
a typical audience of 1707.
Dressed in period costumes,
this ‘audience’ will do such
things as carry on love affairs,
act out other intrigues, lead the
applause, and generally show
typical period reaction.

“The sets have been built,
and they will be changed
throughout the show in the

Here it is! The amazingly ornate, multi-tiered, candy-confection set that Tom Ziegler,
scenic designer of the University Theatre, is constructing for the next UT presentation,
THE BEAUX’ STRATEGEM. For inioré on Ziegler'and his work, see story above.

same way as it was done in the
early 1700’s. You see, there was
no space in the Restoration
playhouse to ‘fly’ the backdrops
up into the ceiling. Instead, the
‘winged shutter’ method was
used, and will be utilized here.
A series of backdrops is all it
really is, which are pulled
aside, one by one, to reveal the
backdrop of the next scene. Ob-
viously, this makes for very fast
scene changes—no need to dim
the lights or stop the action
here...

“The scenery, it must be
remembered, is just there for
its its use as spectacle. There
are no functional pieces; in
fact, the tables and chairs are
often painted on the backdrop!
The reason for this is that the
actors are often far in front of
the set anyway, either expoun-
ding their views, indulging in a
sword fight, or some other ac-
tivity quite close to the au-
dience.”

So, in essence, the set

will be open for interpretation
at many levels. On the one
hand, it can be enjoyed purely
for its spectacle—probably the
most ornate designs ever seen
in the old Troubadour. But, with
the use of those box seats and
two-dimensional interior
backdrops, the audience will
see humor beyond even the
hilarious script, in the quirks of
an age which will be on display
all around the _ actors
themselves. In fact, The Beaux’
Strategem indeed appears to be
rich with attractions—the only
upsetting thing being whether
to follow the plot of the play or
leer at the couple in the balcony
box’..

Many other ideas are in the
works for the show, which
seems to have all the energy
and enthusiasm among _ its
workers, necessary for a suc-
cess. Next week, the Ring-tum
Phi will examine the play itself,
with some comments from
director Gordon.

Poles Return to W&L!

by M. Gray Coleman

This Sunday night, November
13, at 8:30 p.m. in the
Troubadour Theatre, the Polish
Mime Company of the Warsaw
Chamber Opera Association
will return to the WaL campus
for another performance.

This mime group is a
distinguished collection of ar-
tists who have made two
previous visits to the campus.
Last October saw the first of
these visits, when the Glasgow
Endowment Committee
brought them here for a series
of performances’ and
workshops. So great was the
response, that the Committee
brought them back for five
weeks last spring, as part of the
Drama 140 styles course. At
that time, they taught students
the art of mime, and created
new entertainments for mime
especially for the W&L movice
actors.

Since that time, the group has
had a very busy schedule, the
capstone of which has been the
creation of yet another new per-
formance, entitled Meditations.
This new work is evidently a
source of great pride to the
Poles; one has called it the
finest achievement they have
had to date. And it is Medita-
tions which will be presented

next Sunday night in the

Troubadour.

The company is coming from
Greensboro, where they have
been at UNC doing workshops
and 2. performances. From
there, they will pass through
Lexington just long enough for
an overnight “friendly visit,”
while at the same time working
in one performance for the
W&L community. From there,
they’re off for a week of work in
Buffalo, and after a brief rest in
New York, their tour will con-
tinue in St. Croix, Virgin
Islands—and then, back home.

A year ago, no one could have
predicted the close ties that
would develop between these
talented artists and Washington
and Lee. But, due to their
pressive schedule, and the
distance of their home base, one
can never be sure when they
will return to campus. If you
missed their first two visits,
now is definitely the time to go
and see them inMeditations.
RESERVATIONS’ ARE
NECESSARY!!! Many seats
are already booked up but some

‘New York, New York’
The Land of Oz

by Seth Oserin

Hope, joy, dream and color
are all part of that fantasy that
had evolved into nothing more
than a total reflection of the pre-
sent. The restlessness of the
1960,s transformed our only real
form of escape into a classroom
of consciousness in which fan-
tasy and romanticism were an-
tique and obsolete, and all
replacements for reality were
scorned at and discarded.

But once in a while we are
reminded of the fantasy that
was Hollywood. The excitement
and anticipation reenter the at-
mosphere, and the theater, once
again, becomes a house of wor-
ship.

Such is the.case with Martin

Scorsese’s ‘‘New York, New
York.’’ Once the curtain is rais-
ed, you are suspended in a cloud
as an elated observer, not a
defendant before society’s win-
dow.

What director Scorsese has
succeeded in doing is to take the
total romanticism of the 1930’s
and 40’s and combine it with the
intensity of the 1970’s. The ef-
fect proves to be both unusual
and stimulating. Surrealistic as
well as realistic sets are used
interchangeably, but sym-
bolism plays only a very minor
role in this story. You are there
to enjoy, not to study.

Voices entertain
in Chapel

by Ned McDonnell

On Tuesday night, Voices
Inc., the highly acclaimed
Manhattan black theatre troupe
staged a ‘‘Roots’’ type of play,
“Journey Into Blackness.”’ The
piece, intended to increase
Black Awareness among all
Lexingtonians (with the white
community in particular), fail-
ed to attain its desired effect in
two areas.

First of all, the first half of the
production, from Africa to the
Civil War, scanned _ the
historical period too briefly,
(e.g. Harriet Tubman,
antebellum black underground
leader for freedom, was men-
tioned at glance one time
throughout the play). In addi-
tion, certain historical errors
were also present. For one, the
black consciousness musical
strongly implied that Euro-
peans captured the slaves. The
truth was that slavery was in-
troduced to the Western World
through the systems of slavery
present in Africa where the
kings of certain tribes had sub-
jugated the blacks of other
tribes to involuntary servitude.

SABU-sponsored group which
performed last Tuesday in Lee
Chapel. For details, see story
this page...

Through the combination of the
desire of the African
slaveholders to trade off
residual slaves and the need of
the whites for cheap labor as
agricultural resources, the in-
stitution of slavery germinated
and later thrived in Western
Society. Later in the first half,
the drama implied that planta-
tion owners were insensitive to
the needs of their slaves thus
minimizing the benevolent
paternalism which existed on
many plantations. Such factual
distortions served only to in-
crease the relative culpability
of the white man in order to
enhance the sympathy of the
audience for the lot of the black
man.

The second half, however,
saw a vast improvement in its
excellence of portraying the
black up until 1950 and how
blacks coped with the hell of the
unfair work-week, their blues,
with wine, women, and jazz on
Saturday nights and gospel
singing on Sunday morning. In-
deed the weekend became the
black man’s recreational and
tension releasing institution.
But the play faltered on the last
scene about the protests, wren-
ching freedoms for blacks from
the whites. Again the cast
overlooked an_ important

Close Losses Bring

Losing Streak to Nine

The W&L soccer Generals
dropped two road contests and
one home event last weekend
losing t 3-1 to James Madison,
2-1 to Virginia Tech, and 3-0 to
the University of Virginia in the
VISA playoffs. The Tech loss
was especially heart-breaking
as it came after two ten minute
overtime perids played in a
driving rainstorm in
Blacksburg, Virginia.

W&L scored first in the Hokie
game on a free kick by Junior
Bill Stone, and led 1-0 at the

scored what proved to be the
eventual winner mid-way
through the second overtime.

Against the University of
Virginia last Tuesday the
Generals played the Wahoos

Virginia led 1-0 at the end of the

Two Point Conversion Fails;
Generals’ Streak Stopped

by Pete Abitante

After two straight victories in
which the Generals dominated
their opponents to the point of
submission, it seemed that only
an act of God could halt their
momentum and bid for a third
consecutive win. But as luck
would have it, that seems to
have been exactly the case, as
the Generals lost a tough one to
the Wasps of Emory and Henry
74.

Torrential downpours
through the week transformed
what was once a football field
into an ugly quagmire hamper-
ing the offensive capabilities of
both teams.

With the offense shut down, it
was a day for the defense to
clear the mud from their eyes

and play their best. That’s ex-
actly what they did. The
Generals’ defensive play which
was one of the finest of the
season, turned back several
Emory and Henry scoring
threats after turnovers in W&L
territory.

While the entire defensive
unit played well, special men-
tion goes to linebackers Carl
Folcik, who intercepted two
Wasp passes, Jeff Slatcoff,
roverback Bob Clements, and

Fencers Not Foiled By Foes

by Rex Nyquist
The newly formed Fencing
club won its first meet against
James Madison University on
Saturday 16-13. It was the first
time W&L has fielded a fencing
squad since 1942.

Six W&L fencers participated
in the meet, which used the
scoring standards prescribed
by the American Fencing
League Association. Each one
of W&L’s fencers met each one
of Madison,s once, for a total of
thirty matches.

Sophomore Paul Nathan and
junior Herb. Jennings each
registered four victories for the

Generals. David Garner, John
Stathakis and Rob Earle garned
two victories apiece, while Bill
Hill and Willy Mackie each ac-
cumulated a point for the team.
Hill and Captain Will Wendt
fenced saber, while the rest of
the team fenced foil.

Dr. James Worth, the club’s
sponsor and coach, was ex-
tremely proud of the team’s
performance. He said that they
fenced with ‘‘great en-
thusiasm.’’ He also com-
plimented the dedication of the
fencers, noting that most of the
equipment they use is paid for
by themselves. Dr. Worth hopes
that. fencing can become an
established sport at Washington

and Lee. He stressed that the
club still needs some financial
support, as it is largely in-
dependently funded.

The next meet is tentatively
scheduled for February. The
club then hopes to fence VMI,
George Mason, Vanderbilt and
Madison.

Meanwhile, the fencers con-
tinue to practice hard every
weekday on the fifth floor of the
gym. A student who stopped by
for a few minutes remarked
that the clubs fencers
displayed: ‘‘A good sense of
camaraderie. They help each
other a lot. Nobody fools
around, and everybody takes
the sport seriously.”

freshman tackle Joe Wallace
who had his best game in a
W&L uniform. The defense held
Emory and Henry to 208 total
yards, including 97 . yards
rushing which marked the third
straight week the W&L “Big
1” has held opponents to under
100 yards rushing. a

Emory and Henry began its
lone scoring drive of the day on
the W&L 32. Seven plays later,
aided by a critical pass in-
terference call on fourth down,
quarterback Mike Roberts con-
nected with tight end Mike
Snow on an eight yard scoring
strike with 5:29 remaining in
the first half. Jeff Done kicked
what proved to be the winning
point, and Emory and Henry led
at the half 7-0.

The W&L offense failed to
capitalize on two golden op-
portunities in the second half.
Recovering a Wasp fumble with
9:23 left in the third quarter the
Generals had a first and ten
from the Emory and Henry
eleven yard line. A run for a one
yard loss and three incomplete
passes left the Generals empty
handed. The second muffed oc-
casion came with 11:23 remain-
ing in the game when the
Generals had a first and ten

from the E-H 36 yard line only
to be intercepted on third down.

But the W&L offense did not
become discouraged and in fact
had to get in the game the hard
way—an 80 yard drive. With
4:24 remaining in the game,
W&L had a first down on its
own twenty. Quickly they mov-
ed down the field on seven
plays, including a 30 yard pass
to Richie Wiles, a 19 yard com-
pletion to Bob Szczecinski, and
a 16 yard run by quarterback
Ted Hissey. With 1:17 left on the
clock, Stu Atkinson took it in
from two yards out for the
touchdown. The Generals
gallantly tried to win the game
with a two point conversion but
a Hissey pass intended for Wiles
in the corner of the endzone was
batted away by a strong E-H
pass rush.

The Generals got the ball
back on their own 25 yard line
with :13 seconds remaining, but
the clock expired with W&L on
the Wasp 36 yard line. Final
E-H7, W&L6.

This week the Generals face
Gettysburg College. The Bullets
are also 2-7 on the year and

week 47-4). W&L beat Get-

Cross-Country Team

Takes 4th In ODAC

by Clem Carter
The ODAC Cross Country
Championship meet was held at
Roanoke College last Saturday.
In the heavy rain the Generals
could only manage a fourth
place finish.

Eastern Mennonite College,
led by the ODAC’s most
valuable runner Kenny
‘Laymen, with 29 points took the
conference championship.
Eastern Mennonite coach Elton
Horst was named the ODAC’s
coach of the year. Bridgewater
provided stiff competition for
Eastern Mennonite coming in
second with 37 points’ Lyn-
chburg College and Washington
and Lee battled it out for third
place. Lynchburg managed to
edge out the Generals by only
four points, their point total was
81, W&L’s was 85. Roanoke Col-
lege finished in fifth place with
152 points. Emory and Henry
and - Hampden-Sydney were
sixth and seventh respectively.
Their point totals were 180 and
182.

In the meet the Generals were
led by senior co-captain Allen
Weeks who captured 10th place.
Weeks’ time was 28 minutes and
nine seconds. Richard Bird
came in six seconds after
Weeks finishing 11th. Bob Bates
was the third General runner
coming in the 18th place. Bates
ran the 8000 meter course in 28
minutes 47 seconds. The fifth
General runner was Brian
Adams who came in two places
after Daniels. Adams was only
eight seconds behind Daniels.
The sixth and seventh
Washington and Lee runners,

27th and 29th overall, were
Hans Furuland and senior co-
captain Bill Welch. Senior
Kevin Grommy was the eighth
General.

According to Coach Miller the
Generals had gone into the meet
hopeful of beating Lynchburg
and had a possible shot at se-
cond place. Miller was not
dissatisfied with the team’s per-
formance, however. The point
spread between Lynchburg and
W&L was just four points.

As far as the entire season,
goes Miller was pleased with
the team’s performance. A win-
ning season is the goal he had
hoped for, the Generals were 10
wins and five losses. Miller said
that if the individual runners
are satisfied with their per-
formances then he is also. The
fact that the Generals made it
through the season without any
major injuries was perhaps the
best part of the season for
Miller.

Although only eight Generals
ran in the championship meet,
the Cross Country team was
comprised of 22 members. Of
the 22 runners all of them ran in
at least one meet. Miller prais-
ed all of the members on the
team for the amount of time and

sacrifice the runners had spent
in practice.

On Monday the Cross Country
team held a team meeting in
which the 1978-79 co-captains
were elected. They are Bob
Bates, class of 79 and Richard

, Bird, class of 80.

W&L Swimmers: |
Why Not The Best’

by Heartsill Ragon

Most W&L students are quite
familiar with the fame and suc-
cess of the W&L lacrosse, ten-
nis and basketball teams. But
sometimes the swimming team
tends to go unnoticed; enclosed
in a steamy, humid corner of
the gymnasium; shrowded
from student enthusiasm and
participation.

This year Coach Bill Stearns’
swimming team is out to prove
it too can join the winning and
highly-praised ranks of W&L
athletics.

Stearns has set his goals
high: he plans to have an entire
team of All-Americans. The
swimmers also have set their
goals high: many have been
practicing since the beginning
of school; others are swimming
a total of 10,000 yards per day.

The first test of the 1977-78
W&L swimming Generals will
come this weekend as the team
travels to Pennsylvania for
their first swimming encounter

of the year: the Millersville Col-
lege relays.

Thirteen strong teams from
the East Coast are expected to
attend ‘this weekend event—
teams which include several of
the powerhouse’ teams
Washington and Lee will face in
the upcoming year.

Coach Stearns will be calling
on an assortment of veterans as
well as rookies to meet his
demanding goals.

With the loss of superstar
swimmer Ted Van Leer,
Stearns said he will be forced to
rely on freshman Scott Duff and
Bob Newcomb. Filling in for
Van Leer is no easy task as
Stearns realizes. He admits that
they both are slower than the
grad, but adds they have good
potential and three years of
competition and practice.

Senior John Hudson will be
called upon to carry away the
most awards for the team. A 13-
time All-American, Hudson is
by far the best swimmer on the

Juniors Chip Hoke and Keith

motivation on the team so far
this year. Coming to school two
weeks before the start of
classes, these men have been

Freshmen Jay Diesing and
George Irvine will be diving for

The enthusiasm and outlook
of the W&L swimming

New York, New York: Good
Town, Wonderful Movie

(continued from page 5)
huge Rainbow Room—like New
York night club where Robert
DeNero clumsily attempts a
pick-up of Liza Minnelli. The
rest of the story centers around
both their personal and their
professional (he is a sax player
and she is a singer) lives,
which, it is soon discovered,
become harder and harder to
separate.

Very rarely do you see two ac-
tors interact the way Minnelli
and DeNero do in this movie.
They work off each other in a
way that would make any aspir-
ing actor envy. Both profes-

sionals are superb, with intense
performances constantly !eav-
ing electricity in the air. The
highlight scene—the trip to the
maternity ward—brings this in-
tensity to a climax. Minnelli is
her usual non-exhausting self,
with a performance of the title
song that reminds one so much
of her mother, Judy Garland,
that you need the close-up shots
to remind you who is really on
stage.

Music is provided primarily
by Ebb and Kander, although
you feel lucky when you get to

- hear an entire song. The reason

for this is probably that most of
those songs aren’t worth hear-
ing entirely. However, those
that you do hear in full are good,
with the dynamic title song
highlighting the production’s
music.

The big ten minute production
number has been cut down to
almost nothing, which is a
disappointment to many of us
old Hollywood fans. In addition,
the movie does seem _ un-
necessarily long. However, you
don't really mind. The excite-
ment doesn’t let you. Starts Fri-
day at the State.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

E.C. inaction condemned

If Washington and Lee’s Executive Committee
represented the American judicial system, there
would be no doubt as to why crime is increasing
steadily in this country. The E.C. failed even to repri-
mand Contact co-chairman John Bruch for his com-
mittee’s misuse of student funds at an open hearing
Monday night. Instead, the E.C. allowed itself to be
subjected to reprimands by Bruch for its questioning
of Contact’s activities. The hearing was made a fur-
ther farce with the absence of this year’s co-
chairmen, Webster and Granruth.

In essense, Bruch told the E.C. that it should stay
out of Contact’s affairs because the E.C. did not total-
ly finance Contact. He also helpfully pointed out that
the E.C. would become too overpowering if it tried to
regulate Contact’s expenditures. In defeating Rick
Goddard’s motion 8-1, the E.C. showed obvious agree-
ment with Bruch.

The members of Contact were wrong in throwing
the party without E.C. approval and in secretly keep-
ing the leftover money from 1977. No matter how
they try to justify their abuses., they will always
come up wrong in the end. If this year’s E.C. is unwill-
ing to do anything about such abuses and misuses of
student funds, then the present E.C. should be recall-
ed and a new, more responsible one elected.

These actions of Contact are abuses. In secretly
keeping the leftover funds, not only were these
members acting less than honorably, they directly
violated Article IX, Section B of the student body con-
stitution. Bruch: aruged that co-chairmen were
capable of using their own good judgement in deter-
mining expenditures, what they will be and where
they will go. He also argued that since the members of
Contact worked so hard they were entitled to a party.
And since 15% of their monies come from outside
sources, other than student money, they have the
right to throw any type of party any time they want.

Rubbish! The members of Contact as well as the
members of every other committee on campus are in
the advantageous position of having access to student
funds, and also are able to acquire other donations
and contributions through the use of the name of their
organization, the objective of their organization, and
the efforts they represent. These monies are acquired
from donors on the assumption that they will be used
for the express purpose for which they were re-
quested. Why should these members § glorify
themselves and the duties for which they volunteered
by throwing themselves parties financed from other
people’s pockets? The average man on campus
never gets the opportunity to have a “‘free’’ party for
himself and his special, selected group of friends. Stu-
dent committee members should fee rewarded by the
satisfaction of having done a good job and not feel
they are ‘‘owed”’ something else.

Under Article V Section M of the student body con-
stitution, the E. C. has the power to regulate student
committees. On Monday night the E. C. failed to live
up to its responsibilities. It is time the E.C. stopped
being wishy-washy, stopped adhering to the ‘khaki
culture,’”’ and stopped honoring corrupt traditions.
Violations must be punished, rules must be enforced
and precedents must be set. If the members of this
year’s E. C. are unwilling to accept the respon-
sibilities entrusted to them last March, then students
should begin to question their own March voting deci-
sions, seriously consider the option of recall, and
begin circulating petitions.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

Tipping?

Dear Editor:

In the four years I have been
in the W&L community there
have been numerous changes.
One of the most outstanding
changes has occurred in the
Cockpit. In my freshmen year
they had just received a license
to serve beer other than 3.2 (this
was due to Virginia liquor
laws). Throughout the years the
Cockpit has evolved to become
what I consider a restaurant,
which also provides entertain-
ment for its patrons. The
Cockpit is a genuine option for
dates these days. This stems
almost completely from the fact
that they have installed a policy
of table service. Now, one can
go in and sit down to order; as
opposed to the old counter ser-
vice at the bar. There is only
one element missing in the
Cockpit, yet it is not the fault of
the Cockpit personnel. I am
referring to the policy of tipp-
ing. Faculty and guests seem to
be the only ones who tip. So that
the trend of good service can
continue, let your waiter or
waitress know that you ap-
preciate their hustle. The
Cockpit not only has good enter-
tainment and food, but ex-
cellent management in the per-
sons of Jerry Darrell, Burr Datz
and Dan Scott, who are willing
to listen to constructive
criticism and new ideas. Many
people are working hard to
make the Cockpit a nice place
for the students, so let’s make it
a nice place for them to work. In
other words, let’s start tipping
to show our appreciation for
good service.

Sincerely yours,
Douglas R. Perkins

Guidelines outlined

Dear Editor:

This letter is to clarify the ar-

cerning the recently approved
visitor policy for the law school.
Contrary to that article, all of
the carrels in the law school
library are restricted to use by

law students only. Additionally,
the law school facilities will be
closed to those not engaged in
legal study, for the exam
period, as of Thursday,

GUIDELINES FOR USE OF LEWIS HALL

It is the policy of the Student
Bar Association of Washington
and Lee Law School that Lewis
Hall shall be open to all persons
who desire to use its legal
research facilities. Limitations
of space and the need for quiet
require, however, that there be
certain restrictions on the use of
the facilities.

The primary intended use for
Lewis Hall is for legal research
and legal study. Law students
and those engaged in legal
research, at all times, have
priority in the use of the
facilities. That this purpose
shall be met, those who are
disruptive or by their presence
displace those engaged in the
aforementioned intended use of
Lewis Hall, will be required to
leave. Those persons who fail to

Carrell areas are at all times
restricted to law student use.
Also, the upper levels of Lewis
Hall are at all times off-limits to

due to the pressures of law ex-

Lewis Hall at this time, further
restrictions are necessary. For

Dear Editor:

After reading yet another
sensationalist-oriented article
concerning the SAB and its
finances, I feel I must reply
again to alleged improprieties
dof use of student body funds.
The basis for the lead article
and editorial of last week’s RTP
was a misquote of Jack Bovay,
junior EC rep. His quoted state-
ment that the SAB had not been
keeping receipts is simply er-
roneous.

 

From this you editorially ©

state that “the people who head
and serve on the various com-
mittees and organizations
around campus have no concep-
tion of what it means to use and
have access to other people’s
money” and that a “gross
disregard for the procedure and

policy laid down by the EC con-

cerning the use of student
funds” has occurred.

All of this is based on a mis-
quote. How many other of the
articles that have appared in
the RTP are based on other
flimsy evidences? I will per-
sonally state that ere has not
been an error free article writ-
ten on the SAB this year. That is
shoddy journalism.

You go on to state that
students should be ‘‘made
aware that they are answerable
to an authority on campus for
deceitful and dishonorable ac-
tions.’ I will remind you, Mr.
Gallagher, that the EC, not the
RTP is that authority. They are
the decision-making body on
campus. The headline of last
week (which suffered from poor
layout) said that the SAB was in
trouble. From whom? — the
RTP? If so — so what?

The EC meeting of last Mon-
day night was anticlimatic in
relation to the build-up it receiv-
ed in the RTP. The “inquiry”
that could have resulted in ‘‘an
automatic honor violation”
lasted about three minutes. Was
that event worthy of front page
status? :

4th estate

You end your editorial saying
that if the EC does not react to
these alleged ‘“‘gross offenses,
‘honor’ may well become a
term inapplicable to this cam-
pus community.”’ You make an
appeal to honor, but in previous
editorals have talked of such
honorable activities as rack-
dates.

I think that you, Mr.
Gallagher, are aware that an
editorial is an_ influential
medium. The week before the
EC was to decide on whether or
not to have salaries for publica-
tion heads you ran an editorial
praising the EC for a fine job
that they had done. The motion
to allow salaries to be paid with
monies from students funds was
passed by the EC that week.

If the business manager this
year is doing his job, you stand
to make a fairly substantial
sum of money this spring. If the
figure from your predecessor is
an accurate one, you will make
about $500. The question I will
raise now is — when are we go-
ing to see our money’s worth?

You are in the position among
student groups to be able to
stand in front of the proverbial
fan with the shovel of prover-
bial fertilizer aiming at
whichever peer group you
desire. That position is akin to
having your cake (a position of
authority in a student group)
and eating it too ( being able to
degrade peer groups). Now
since the EC has voted to allow
Salaries, you will be paid for
eating your cake. It is not that I
am desiring a piece of the cake,
I just want a little less fertilizer
and a little more quality in
future Ring-tum Phi’s.

Bill Tucker, ‘79

The RtP was not alone in
hearing Mr. Bovay’s remarks
concerning the SAB. EC
representative Rick Goddard
told the Phi the quote was ac-
curate.

Dear Editor:

I was greatly dismayed by
your editorial of last week, in
which you incorrectly stated
that I had accused the Student
Activities Board of abusing
study body funds. The use of
this second hand information as
the basis for an_ editorial,
without even talking to me
about the matter, is actually an
abuse of your editorial powers.

- At the Executive Committee
meeting of October 31, I did
state that the S.A. B. had not ob-
tained the night deposit bags re-
quired by E.C. accounting
guidelines, and that the Board’s
funds had not been placed in the
accounts of its various subcom-
mittees. These problems, which
stemmed from a lack of com-
munication among the in-
dividuals involved, have since
been cleared up to the complete
satisfaction of the E.C.

Jim Foreman, treasurer of
the S.A.B., has kept completely
accurate accounting records,
with a receipt for every expen-
diture. I would like to take this
opportunity to commend Jim,
co-chairman Bill Tucker and
Charlie Hulfish, and the entire
S.A. B. for jobs well done in the
face of a great deal of adversi-
ty. Constructive criticism of the
S.A.B.’s future actions will be
helpful to the maintenance of a
smooth running operation, but
unfounded accusations will only
prove detrimental to the
S.A.B.’s_ contribution to the
social life of this campus.

Mike, I hope that in the future
you will follow more acceptable
journalistic practices.

Sincerely,
Jack Bovay
Junior E. C. Representative

Editor:
In light of your reporting and
comments pertaining to the

Contact Committee’s use and:
maintanence of funds,. which.

appeared in the November 3
issue of your newspaper, it is
necessary to enlighten you on
several points.

 

Once Upon

Dear Editor:

Once upon a time in a. little
town in the hills, there lived a
group of men who suffered for
years in seemingly abject
poverty. They lived in shacks on
the outside of town and huddled
daily in a tottering building to
work. This building was
outrageously inadequate in that
it was too old, too small, too in-
accessible, but these men con-
tinued to work hard to support
their families. Somehow,
however, many men rose from
these conditions, became wise
and in turn, were admired for
their wisdom, in spite of these
facilities.

Next to these men worked a
younger group of men who were
just as hard-working, but much
more fortunate. Many of these
could afford many of life’s lux-

A Time...

uries, lived in nicer homes,
drove fancier cars, and
sometimes even threw better
parties. Naturally, from time to
time tensions arose between
these different groups, pushing
them apart. But the young men
were willing to accept the dif-
ferences, and shared what they
could with the older group, and
both groups co-existed happily
for many years.

Then one day, a wise man
decided that it was time to help
out the older men, and he built
them a new factory, a marvel
by the technological standards
of the day. The older men re-
joiced for days and nights, both
for their new building and for its
position—close to the younger
men who they had learned to
love as friends. The older men
even left the old factory to the
younger men, in hopes that with
their youth, they could rebuild

it.
Over the years, many of the
men of both groups passed on,

until few were left who could -

remember how life once was.
Some who remained felt
nostalgia in their hearts for the
way things used to be, Some
older men, confident within the
walls of their factory, decided
that the younger men were too
brash and_ disrespectful—of
their property, and voted to
keep the young men out. The
younger men were outraged,
and tried to recall for the older
men how well they used to live
together, but to no avail. The
older men did not listen to the
younger men, and locked their
doors to them. Sadness existed
where cooperation once had,
and the little town in the hills
was never the same.
Despairingly yours,
Burr Datz

Ring-tum Phi, Nov. 10, 1977, Page?

Firstly, Contact, and the Con-
tact ‘77 program being a case in
point, derives its funds from
three sources: the EC, the IFC
and donations from parents.
The first two groups respective-
ly allocated 53% and 28% of
Contact’s overall funds. The re-
mainder of the monies were ob-
tained from generous and in-
terested parents by means of
direct solicitation in the form of
a letter.

Secondly, Contact ‘77 did in-
deed have money remaining at
the program’s conclusion.
Again this amount was not from
one particular source, but from
three. The cash surplus was at-
tributed to the following: the in-
ability of one scheduled speaker
or a suitable replacement to ap-
pear, a greater than expected
response from W&L parents
(thus indicating their heralding
of past Contact programs and
faith in Contact ‘77) and the
hard working and prudent ef-
forts of committee members.

Thirdly, last year,s co-
chairman inherited many prac-
tices and means of operation,
most of which were deemed
worthwhile and just. Among the
many carry-over procedures
was a beginning cash balance
and the extension of generous
hospitality to guest speakers
which has been a hallmark of
Contact and this university. It
was last year’s co-chairman‘s
hope that these proven pro-
cedures and necessary costs for
success would be perpetuated.
It should be noted that the din-
ner alluded to for Mr. Jenner
and his wife did occur. It includ-

ed committee members, some.

dates, the President of the IFC
and a senior EC representative
(also a Contact member). The
president of the EC was also in-
vited. Further, past Contact
Committees have concluded
their efforts with similar func-
tions for dedicated members
and guest speakers.

Thus, your statement imply-
ing that student body money

Tucker, Bovay and Bruch criticize

altogether true as evidenced b
the sources cited. Your state
ment that Contact had $500.

remaining is false and un

substantiated. To return all off

Contact’s ending balance to the
EC would not be fair to the other
contributors. The EC should in-
deed ask for an accounting of
student funds, and _ student
funds only.

In conclusion your newspaper
has once again printed unfound-
ed remarks and resorted to sen-
sationalism. Such erroneous
reporting week after week is
causing the RtP to join the
ranks of Hustler and Midnight
Magazine. As evidenced by
other student publications on
this campus, controversy is not
a requisite for quality.

Hopefully in your remaining
issues the quality of your stories
and accuracy thereof will im-
prove. The W&L community is
very much in need of a respec-
table student-run newspaper of
which they may be proud. The
RtP owes such respect not only
to its readers but also to its
heritage.

Sincerely,

John L. Bruch III
Co-Chairman
Contact ‘77

Mr. Bruch, we refer you to this
year’s November 3 issue of the
RtP where it was reported that
1978 Contact co-chairman Billy
Webster told the RtP that $500
was remaining from last year.
Also, how can you say this
figure is false when you admit-
ted at the EC meeting Monday
night that you didn’t know
specifically what the remaining
sum of money was? Concern-
ing sensationalism, as long as
students find it within
themselves to consciously
violate the student body con-
stitution, as long as their own
actions are sensational in
nature, the RtP will continue to
report them.

GPA’s up
winter

semester

by Charles Adler

Freshmen, if your GPA
wasn’t what you expected, don’t
despair! Past freshmen
classes, grades have improved
markedly in the Winter terms.
The increased experience and
adjustment of freshmen by
winter results in fewer F’s and
a higher GPA. In the 74-75
academic year, for example,
the average GPA went from a
2.129 to a 2.384 while the number
of freshmen with an average
below a 1.5 dropped from 64 to
35.

This year’s freshmen mid
fall-term average GPA is 2.50,
the highest of any in recent
years. This year’s freshmen
class also has a low number of
students with grades below a 1.5
average with a mere 48 out of a
class of 357 in this category.
There were however more F’s
received by freshmen than in
past years, a total of 119 being
given so far as compared with
89 at the same time last year.

school credits. The Committee
on Courses and Degrees recom-
mended in their October 11th
meeting that the rule as it now
stands should be retained: that
a student should obtain advance
approval for any summer
school course he takes, other-
wise, he takes his chances on
whether or not the course
credits will be accepted. Debate
was carried mostly by faculty
members, with Student Body
president Jim Underhill pro-
viding the only student input. A
motion was passed, 16-3, that
students should ask about a
summer school course before
they take it.

The next topic of discussion

Byrd,

receive

Two Washington and Lee
University students have been
selected to receive the Lewis
Kerr Johnson Commerce
Scholarship, awarded annually
by W&L’s School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics.

The two are Douglas A. Byrd
of Baton Route, La., and Jerry
M. Baird of Fort Worth, Tex.
Byrd, a junior, was selected for
the first time. Baird, one of last
year’s two recipients, had his
scholarship renewed.

Baird is a business ad-
ministration major and a
member of the honorary frater-
nities: Phi Beta Kappa, Beta
Gamma Sigma in commerce,
and Phi Eta Sigma for
freshman-year achievement.
He is also a member of W&L’s

the Faculty Executive Commit-
tee, revealed that the results of
the Faculty EC’s poll showed
the faculty to be “‘overwhelm-
ing in favor of retaining an in-
dependent examination
schedule.’ He briefly discussed
the poll and its results, fielding
questions about the poll and in-
dependent exams in general. In
a 21-1 vote, the UC endorsed the
Faculty EC’s recommendation
to continue independent ex-
aminations.

As a final matter of business,
Professor Sessions introduced a
motion which would limit the
University Council’s meetings
to take place “only when call-
ed...upon the request either of
the President of the university
or of at least six council
members.” He debated briefly
with Professor Goldsten, but
further discussion was tabled
until the next meeting on
December Ist.

WLUR covers returns

The land slide victory for
Republican John Dalton and
early decisions in other area
races reulted in a surprisingly
early sign off for WLUR elec-
tion coverage Tuesday night.

The radio station signed off at
1l p.m. as the gubernatorial
races and most of the minor
races were decided by that time
rather than the 1 a.m. finish
that WLUR News Director Ed
Burgess had expected.

The evening started out hec-
tically as last minute details
were being worked out. During
the first hour the engineers
struggled to keep pace with the
number of raped features, as
the first results began to trickle
in from the polls. As results
came in, the newsmen had
more to talk about and the
Virginia Public Radio Election
Network feeds provided some
relief to the election staff.

One factor that enabled
WLUR to complete its coverage
so early was the pro t response
of the field reporters who were
covering the polls throughout
Rockbridge County. All but one
of Burgess’s reporters called in
their stories and most state
results were reported soon after
the polls closed.

WLUR was able to provide

coverage of the progress of
races around the state as well
as on the local secne because of
its arrangements with the
Virginia Public Radio Election
Network. The radio station was
able to carry the VPREN by
trading local results for permis-
sion to rebroadcast the signal of
WMRA in Harrisonburg.

Burgess was aided by assis-
tant news director, Steve Mat-
tesky, who co-anchored the
election coverage. Other
members of his staff included:
Charlie Smith, covering the
Buena Vista flood wall issue;
Joe Dashiell, who did research
on the candidates; and John
Kingston who covered other
races around the state and the
nation.

The field reporters who called
in results from the polls includ-
ed Cope Moyers, Ken Mastrilli,
Todd Tyson and Kingston. The
first precincts to report showed
an early lead for loser Henry
Howell. The trend changed bet-
ween 8:30 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.
and Dalton’s lead continued to
widen. The Associated Press
declared Dalton the winner at
about 10 p.m. After that it was
all downhill.

Republicans took two of the
top three posts in the state. In

stalled while tests are being run
on the sophisticated equipment.

Complications arose last
week when the present PDPA
computer broke down and the
computer classes were left
without an operating computer.

Plans as of now are to pur-
chase 20 or more simple ter-
minals at a cost of $1000 each
and to purchase sophisticated
terminals costing between
$5,000 and $10,000.

The computer has true virtual
memory with 100,000 discs. The
unit also will employ the
statistical package for social
sciences. Roberts says this is
the most widely used social
science package in the country.

The hope is that final testing

the race for Lt. Governor,
Democrat Charles Robb en-
joyed an early victory over his
opponent, Joe Canada. The
Republicans took the third seat
in the election of the “Big
Three’’ when J. Marshall Col-
eman clinched the Attorney
General spot.

A great deal of stress was
placed on the coverage of local
elections in hopes of capturing a
greater section of the area’s au-
dience. Most of the staff was
assigned to cover these races
because details for other races
in the state could be obtained
from the AP wire and the net-
work. . In local races, Charles
“‘Bunny’’ Gunn and Lacey E.
Putney were reelected to the
House of Delgates for the Ninth
District and Patricia DeLaney,
a Democrat, was reelected Lex-
ington City Treasurer over op-
ponent James Sheridan. In
other other issue of great local
importance the Buena Vista
flood wall proposal was
defeated.

The election staff at WLUR
was pleased with its coverage of
the elections and the mood was
quite jovial as staff members
flooded the floor of Studio A
shortly after the station signed
off at 11 p.m.

will be completed on November
9th.

The computer will use ‘‘flop-
py discs which look like 45 rpm
records.’’ This is designed to
save computer space.

The tape units will be located
in the rear of the computer
center next to the main frame to
keep it from student access.

Students will not be permitted
to use the card reader and line
operator during the day without
an operator, however, they can
use this equipment during off
hours.

The terminals will be “‘up’’ 24
hours a day and Roberts said
“the hope is that 24 terminals
will be in operation this time
next year.”’

Landslide victory for Dalton
ae ae ae ae oe ae a on oo

Republicans celebrate

by David Talley

The Republican victory party
officially began in the ballroom
of the R. E. Lee Hotel at 7 p.m.
with the closing of the polls.
Two hours later, Steve Yeakel,
chairman of the Dalton for
Governor campaign in Lex-
ington, announced that UPI had
declared John Dalton the win-
ner of the governor’s race in
Virginia. The end of a tough
campaign had finally arrived,
and in this case, it was a happy
ending.

While the group was
celebrating Dalton’s victory, a
new surprise was developing. J.
Marshall Coleman, Republican
candidate for Attorney Gener-
nal, was winning in Lexington
and Rockbridge County by big-
ger margins than expected. In
the long run, things worked out
right, and Virginia had elected
its first Republican Attorney
General.

For many of the Republicans
present at the victory party,
both senior party members and
W&L College Republicans
alike, the campaign began back
in June with the Virginia
Republican Convention. The
hard campaigning did not real-
ly get underway in the area un-
til September, when the CR’s
returned to school.

The effect of the W&L CR’s
was widespread. ‘‘There was

really no organized campaign
effort in this area until the W&L
CR’s took over,”’ states Yeakel.
‘‘We organized the area cam-
paign and provided many of the
workers. In addition, the club
has a good rapport with the
senior party and we work well
together.”

Yeakel, who is also President
of the Washington and Lee
Republicans, attributes the
large vote for Dalton in the area
to the hard work done on elec-
tion day. Using the results of the
phone canvass, ‘‘we identified
our voters and turned out every
favorable Dalton voter in East
and West Lexington.” The
W&L GOP Club assisted in
phoning favorable voters, as
well as manning the polls. ‘‘A
lot of people contributed to this
effort,’ said Yeakel, “‘but I
especially appreciate the ef-
forts of Steve Rodgers, CR
Campaign Chairman, Mary
Huffman, who was the founda-
tion of the headquarters, and
Henry Wise (area campaign
treasurer), who never let me
stop running.”’

Thus, a successful campaign
effort came to a climax Tues-
day evening with John Dalton’s
win in Lexington, and subse-
quently in the whole state. It
prompted Yeakel to quip: ‘‘As
Lexington goes, so goes
Virginia.”

Entertainment in Lex.

(continued from page 3)

So far, he added, his weekend
audiences have been picking
up“‘building slowly.”’

Spanky’s

Spanky’s Delicatessen also
has decided to get at a piece of
the student entertainment in-
terest. With a new addition that
will double the dining room size,
Emory Leffel, manager of
Spanky’s has found room to in-
clude a small stage for local and
area musicians.

Leffel said this new addition
had been scheduled for opening
the first of December but,
because of delays, the opening
date was forced back until the
middle of December.

Basically, Leffel will be look-
ing for talented blue grass and
soft, classical guitar players to
entertain beer drinkers and pro-
vide background music for his
dining room crowds.

musical format will be, ac-
cording to Leffel, to create a
mellow atmosphere while draw-
ing an enthusiastic crowd.

Entertainment—good
entertainment—is ready to be
found by W&L students. If it’s
not at the Cockpit then it’s at
one of the other four eateries
around town that are trying to
cater to the likes and dislikes of
the students.

Is it possible that this new in-
terest in area entertainment
could spread to W&L? Could a
night on Main Street replace a
night at Sweet Briar?

Clyde Mull seemed to sum up
the state of entertainment af-
fairs in Lexington when he
reported, “I can’t seem to
generate any interest.”

Assassination
attempt fails

An attempt was made on J.
Michael Gallagher's life
Wednesday afternoon when a
smoke bomb was hurled at him
from a 4th floor Graham-Lee
dormitory window. Gallagher,
who was talking with Mock Con-
vention chairman John Trump
about the merits of a free press,
escaped the assassination at-
tempt without injury. A visibly
shaken Gallagher remarked to
reporters, ‘‘I need a vacation..”’

an honor violation. Perkins said
it is ridiculous to think that “‘If
they lose a receipt for a pencil
sharpener, it’s an honor viola-
tion.”

After the discussion was over,
Goddard’s motion was voted
down. Goddard was the only
person to vote for the motion,
while Borden abstained. Jim
Underhill, Jack Bovay, Mike
Missal, Steve Abraham, Andy
Bodenstab, Jim Davis,
Christophere Gammon and
Perkins voted against the mo-
tion. Vice president George
Griffin and secretary Neil Pen-
tifallo were not present.

During the course of the
meeting Bruch substantiated
most of what was reported in
the Phi on Thursday. He said
there was a dinner for Bruce
Jenner, that it cost about $115
and that it was held in the Col-
lege Inn.

He said Contact got “‘no for-

No matter how abstract the
concept of the piece, the lack of
substantive historical informa-

misrepresentation of historical
fact on the other tended to
undercut the meaning and im-
pact of the musical.

The costuming was effective
in portraying the times and the
misery of each era represented
in the play. The three females
were very good in their singing
especially in their ability to hit

reported the UCC and the
Cockpit would not be able to ac-
quire Dave Von Ronk for a per-
formance. Now the word is we
can but he would be a real
burden on the UCC’s limited
budget.

The big plan to get psyched
about is the idea of having a
University Center Weekend
right after we get back from
Thanksgiving. The _ ultra-
optimistic plan, as of right now,
is to have five days of solid
entertainment in the Pit. The
‘“‘weekend”’ would start Tues-
day, November 29, and last
through December 3. The plan
would be to have a crazy movie
night to kick it off, followed with
four days of top notch musical
entertainment. If you have any
strong feelings for or against
this idea or for or against the
planned dates, please stop me
and talk to me about it. I'd ap-

past year’s EC, president Tom
Hunter and senior represen-
tative Walt Kelley, were invited
to the dinner. Bruch said Alfred
Robinson, the past year’s Inter
Fraternity Council president
was invited, as well as Contact
members, dates. The persons
invited were ‘‘left up to the
discretion of the Contact co-
chairmen,’ he said.

Bruch defended the dinner in
part because two EC members
knew about it. He said their
knowledge implied consent to
the dinner. Goddard responded
that it “implied consent from
two guys who wanted a nice din-
ner.”’

Bruch said Contact’s propos-
ed budget for dinners was $100.
He said Contact ‘‘most definite-
ly went over” its $100 budget.

toward paying for a dinner each
speaker has in Lexington as
part of his Contact itinerary,
Bruch said. It is a necessary
part of attracting speakers, he
added. He said he believed Con-
tact got its money’s worth out of
every speaker.

“It sounds like you people got
your money’s worth,”’ Goddard
said in reference to the dinner.
The purpose of Contact is to br-
ing in speakers, not give din-
ners, he said. Bruch defended
the dinners by saying that he
‘inherited past practices’ and
perpetuated those practices.

In regard to the funds Contact
kept in its account over the
summer, Bruch said “I
understood they were to remain
with Contact.’’ He said he was
not familiar with the student
constitution’s stipulation that
all unused money be returned to
the Central Student Body Fund.
