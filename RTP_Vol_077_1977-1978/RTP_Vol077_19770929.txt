Volume LXXVII

 

by Fraser Humphreys and
Heartsill Ragon

For the first time in recent
history, Washington and Lee
students will have to experience
a “dry’.homecoming concert
according to Student Activities
Board co-chairman Bill Tucker.

Tucker said the SAB had been
trying to gain an extended tem-
porary Alcohol Beverage Con-
trol license for the entire Stu-
dent Center complex so that
beer could be served at the
dance and the students could
roam the halls with their
drinks. This arrangement,
Tucker said, would alleviate the
overcrowded conditions ex-
perienced at past dining hall
functions. If this agreement had
been reached, the Homecoming
concert and dance, featuring
Archie Bell and the Drells along
with Razz-a-Matz, would have
been held in Evans Dining Hall.

Tucker reported that the SAB
originally had planned to ask

Phi Kaps
fined $200

by Reid Slaughter

Only one major fine for rush
violations was levied by the IFC
after last week’s Judiciary
Board and Student Affairs Com-
mittee meetings; although two
other serious cases are still pen-
ding.

Phi Kappa Sigma _ was
ordered to pay a $200 fine for
serving beer at an Open House.
The fine, which was originally
only $100, was upped by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee on the
grounds that the violation was
“blatant and premeditated.”
On top of that, the Phi Kapps
were given another $25 fine for
late return of rushees.

In other minor violation

cases, both Sigma Chi and °
Lambda Chi were given $25
fines for late return of rushees,

while the PIKA’s were issued a
$5 fine for the same offense.

The FIJI’s were given a $10
fine for transporting rushees to
Open Houses (they are suppos-
ed to walk to and from the
quad), and also instructed to
replace a ladder which they
borrowed from Sigma Phi Ep-
silon and never returned.

In the two cases still pending,
both SAE and FIJI have been
charged with violations involv-
ing possibly severe fines. Both

regional ABC officials for an ex-
tention of the dining hall’s
beerserving permit. After SAB
consultations with ABC Agent
William T. Burnett, it was
decided that the SAB would not
press Burnett and the ABC for
an extention because, ac-
cording to Tucker, Burnett im-
plied W&L and the SAB had
been ‘“‘getting away with
purder’’ in their beer handling
practices during Fancy Dress.
After being virtually assured of
a visit from ABC officials and
running the risk of violating
ABC regulations, the SAB
decided not to apply for the ex-
tention.

Tucker reported that because
the license extention Was not
applied for, the concert and
dance will now be held in the
Old Doremus Gymnasium
beginning at 9 p’m. and will last
until approximately 1:00 a.m.

Tucker explained that the
location for the Friday night
dance was decided upon after
considerable debate and com-

Among the new faces on cam-
pus this year is the somewhat
bearded and amiable
countenance of Dr. Bell. Dr.
Bell comes to Washington and
Lee from England’s Oxford
University as part of an ex-
change program between the
two universities. The program,
which has sent our own Pro-
fessor LaRue (law department)
to Oxford for a term, was
primarily initiated and
engineered by Professor Jar-
rard of Washington and Lee’s
Psychology Department. In
Lexington only for the Fall
Term, Professor Bell will serve

as a member of the Geology

Department.

Professor Bell, born in

. Yorkshire, England, attended

and graduated from Trinity Col-
lege at Oxford University. Arm-
ed with a Doctorate in Geology,

:-Dr. Bell was sent to the Solomon

- %

Island as a member of the

9 scientific branch of England’s

‘Colonial Service. After two
years of service he returned to

England as a Research Assis-

tant in his Alma Mater’s
Geology Department. As a
Research Assistant, Professor
Bell’s interest in Geology car-
ried him on various expeditions
throughout the Northern
Hemisphere. More recently,
Dr. Bell has become a full-
fledged member of Oxford’s
faculty college, from whence he
comes to Washington and Lee.
Dr. Bell, a specialist in the

ment from the SAb, dining hall
and ABC officials.

According to Evans Dining
Hall manager Jerry Darrell,
the dining hall has never been a
suitable location for dances, in-
cluding Fancy Dress because of
the great amounts of uninten-
tional damage the Commons
facility experiences during
these activities. Managers for
Archie Bell and the Drells ruled
out use of Zollman’s Pavillion
because of some unpleasant
past experiences the band has
experienced there. Tucker add-
ed that “for your big Friday
night dance, the place is not
very classy.”

We thought of holding the
dance in the new gym,”’ Tucker
said, “but that ruled out danc-
ing as well as drinking which
brings us to the old gym. At
least we can dance there.”’

Because of tightened ABC
regulations, the SAB had to veto
the originally planned idea of
serving beer outside of the
Doremus Gymnasium doors.

Tucker reluctantly
acknowledged that the SAB
would “have to be stricter than
usual on those attempting to br-
ing booze into the gym due to
the fact that an ABC official
may be present. ‘“‘We have the
right to deny entry at the door
until it’s beyond a reasonable
doubt that a person isn’t br-
inging a bottle in.”

For those persons feeling
cheated out of an evening of em-
bibement, the opportunity to in-
dulge will be presented Satur-
day afternoon as the first of the
school year’s Grain Parties will
be conducted at Zollman’s
Pavillion from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m.

Sophmore Class President
Les Cotter has announced that
the afternoon’s festivities will
be highlighted by the Andrew
Lewis Band’s_ concert/dance
performance.

Cotter added that class
passes are required for this
event and may be purchased at

NUMBER 3

$56,000

requested

from EC

by Lee Howard

The yearly budget battle has
begun! More than $56,000 was
requested by nine student
organizations at Monday
night’s Executive Committee
meeting.

The Student Activities Board
made the largest request, ask-
ing for $33,850. That’s about 60
per cent of.all requests received
at the meeting, and about 50 per
cent of this year’s student fund.
Last year the SAB received
$32,260, which means the
organization is looking for a
$1,590 raise in appropriations.

In addition, co-chairmen
Charlie Hulfish and Bill Tucker
asked for “‘a one-time expense "
to improve the projector situa-
tion.” They said that they could
get two projectors and two
cinemascope lenses for approx-
imately $2,000. Hulfish said this
would be an extremely good
deal. E. C. president Jim
Underhill said he wants to see
the SAB purchase the new pro-

jectors and lenses regardless of
how much the E.C. decides to
appropriate for the SAB. The
reason for Underhill’s concern
is that, according to Hulfish,
cinemascope movies cannot be
shown until the SAB gets some
new projectors.

One of the major increases in
this year’s SAB budget will go

for more entertainment in the

five” nights per week of enter-
tainment, Tucker said. The
weekends will feature profes-
sional entertainers, while
weekdays will be reserved for
student acts playing for free
beer or some nominal fee like
$5, Tucker said. Also, the
Cockpit happy hours will be
partially financed by SAB
money, the co-chairmen said.
Student Bar

The Student Bar Association
requested $11,500. A large por-
portion of the money will go for
speakers at the Tucker Law
Forum, SBA President Ray
Leven said. He said some of the
money would also go to the
Women Law _ Student’s
Organization for speakers,
recruitment and surveys of
women’s attitudes toward the W
& L Law School. Additionally,
the Black American’s Law Stu-
dent Association would get
some money for speakers, he
said.

Pit Climbs Out
of Depths

by J. Michael Gallagher

“The Cockpit is becoming a
classier establishment,’’ ac-
cording to Cockpit Night
manager Dan Scott. He said a
higher quality of atmosphere
now exists in the Cockpit due to
the new menues, the new per-
sonnel who have provided bet-
ter service for W&L patrons,
and the nightclub atmosphere
that last week permeated the
establishment. It is for this last
reason that Scott announced the
formation of the Progessive
Music Club, which will have an
organizational meeting Thurs-
day at 8:00 p.m. in the music
practice room in the University
Center.

Scott said the purpose of the
club was to get student musi-
cians together to play and ex-
change ideas. The _ club
members would be given the op-
portunity to play in the Cockpit.
The members would also find
out the types of music the W&L
community wants to hear by
means of a survey of Cockpit
patrons, and play them. This
survey would also dictate the
type of music that would be
played in the jukebox. Scott in-
dicated that much of the out-
dated disco tunes would be
removed and replaced with
more recent popular tunes.

The club would also assume
ithe responsibility of booking
‘high quality acts into the ‘‘Pit”
during the weekend, according
to Scott. He said that not only
would the entertainers provide
the student body with high
quality entertainment; they
would also be a_ learning
medium for club members,
similar to the workshops held
by visiting string quartets for
the members of Mu Beta Psi,
the music society.

Scott concedes there is a
barrier to his ideas and hopes.
Presently, the SAB controls
who will play in the Cockpit,
and the money necessary for
funding the acts. For these
reasons, Scott will approach the
E.C. Monday with a budget re-
quest. He said, ‘‘For four years
now, I have watched the SAB
run the student activities on
campus, including the enter-
tainment in the Cockpit.
Homecoming is evidence of the
type of job they have done.

“‘They have hired Archie Bell
and the Drells for $2,200 and
Raz-a-Mataz for $1,200 for one
night. A top quality rock band
could have been hired for half
the price. There are more rock
bands on the market than soul,
and they cost less! It’s a matter
of supply and demand. There is
a contingent here who enjoy
soul music, but it is not per-
vasive enough to give the entire
student body a soul band for

Harriet Thomas.

 

A restored historic landmark with five period-furnished guest suites
AAA and COUNTRY INNS AND BACK ROADS. A different
experience in overnight hospitality for those who love fine things.
Students may make reservations for their parents and tour the
house from 10-5 daily. Wednesday until 2:00 or write Mrs.

50% more in price. That is why I
believe the club members
should be allowed to book acts
into the Cockpit. Afterall, who
are better judges of music than
musicians themselves?”’

Scott said the Cockpit in the
student center is for students
and should reflect what the
students want in the form of
entertainment. He said there
is no other outlet for students to
book entertainment acts except
through the SAB, whose
musical and entertainment
tastes he doesn’t trust. The
Cockpit was on the coffee house
circuit last year, Scott said, and
maybe one-half of the acts book-
ed into the pit were competent,
and one fourth were acts that
students were interested in see-
ing. He said there were no name
performers, and acts appeared
very infrequently. He pointed
out that last week there was an
act every night in the Cockpit
until Friday night when the SAB
took over the entertainment
responsibilities. Since then,
there has yet to be entertain-
ment in the Cockpit.

SAB co-chairman Bill Tucker
said that students playing in the
Cockpit is fine. But as far as
Students booking themselves
and other acts into the Cockpit,
he was against it. He also said
that paying the students with
student body funds was not
right in his opinion. He believes
the SAB should have control
over who and what acts appear
in the Cockpit.

Leven said the reason.he was
asking for $4,500 more money
than last year is that he feels
law students should have their
$20 per semester activity fee go
for activities law students are
interested in. He said that over
50 per cent of his class is mar-
ried and that married students
don’t get anything out of most of
the social activities that go on
around W&L.

When law students were in
Tucker Hall they received
about 65 per cent of the money
they put into the student fund,
Leven said. However, because
of the better facilities provided
by Lewis Hall, law students
want to try to use the entire
building as effectively as possi-
ble, he said. In order to do this,
he said, he wants to use approx-
imately 95 per cent of the funds
law students pay to the student
fund. According to George Grif-
fin, the law school contributes
$12,165 to the student fund.

As freshmen attempt to crawl
out of the sandbox of life, often
referred to as “‘high’”’ school,
and ensconce themselves in the
mud hole of egregious super-
profundity, (known as W&L to
all but a few gentlemen who
must refer to it as “that great
institution of higher learning:
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’) they begin to develop a
whole new vocabulary of |
euphemisms..

Example: ‘Bag it.” In high
school they would have said,
“But mommy, I don’t want to.”
The derivation of this phrase
appears to be Krogers, Va.

“Booking.’’ In high school, if
this word had been used at all, it
} would have been called ‘‘study-

come into your vocabulary so

ed “‘getting a Semite’”’
} “Hose queen,’’. A. virtually §

he said the E.C. should recom-
mend to the Board of Trustees
that the fee be raised to $25 per
term from the present $20 per
term. McNider said thet the
M.C. needs at least $300 this

year for operating expenses.
Calyx :

Calyx representative,

business manager Grant

Leister, said he will need $6,500
for the coming year. He asked
for $2,000 of the money right
away so Calyx can get a 2 per
cent discount on the first pay-
ment for the book. The E.C
voted 10-0 to give Calyx the
money. The payment will be for
1/3 the cost of the book, he said.
The book costs $17,000, he add-
ed.

Calyx’s request was for $800
more than last year. The $410
theft from the yearbook office
was partially responsible,
Leister said. Also, senior class
pictures will be more expensive
this year, he said. The pictures
will cost the Calyx $5 this year
as opposed to $2.25 last year.
Last year seniors were charged
$4.50; this year they have been
charged $6. _

Leister said this year’s year-
book will have about 25 more
pages and will include quite a
few color pictures.

RtP

The Ring-Tum Phi asked for
$3,000. Griffin noted that is
almost $1,000 less than the Phi
got last year. He said he assum-
ed increased advertising
revenue accounted for the dif-
ference.

Ariel

Ariel, W&L’s literary
magazine, requested $1,200 at
the hour and a half meeting.
Parker Potter, Ariel’s editor,
said he is planning to publish
two issues this year. He said the
two Ariels would be about 25
pages. Four hundred issues of
each Ariel would be printed, he
said. Each issue would cost $475
to print with only two colors, but

Potter said he wants to have the

capacity to print one of the
issues in full color. That issue
would cost an additional $200,
he said,

isa ana g$s3 32438583 80458 €82ET 394 4 9 Sretresvy tee ehtae i |

When asked why he thought
Ariel could publish two issues
this year when it could only get
out one last year, Potter said,
“It’s not terribly hard if we get
student contributions.” He said
last year’s situation was unique
in that the editor quit in the mid-
dle of the year, making the tran-
sition of power very difficult .
and making a Winter term edi-
tion an impossibility.

Others -

_ In two unanimous decisions
the E.C. gave the indoor soccer
club $100 to sponsor a Liberty
Hall Invitational Tournament
as well as to buy new uniforms
and goals, and decided to retain
Tom Spencer as the E.C.’s at-
torney for a fee of $200.

In all, the E.C. heard request
for $56,350. The E.C. has only

‘approximately $68,000, which

must last the entire year. Only
about $34,000 is available this
term. The E.C. had slightly
more to work with last year
thanks to an unusually large
freshman class.

The E.C. will decide on ap-
propriations at the next
meeting, Monday at 7 p.m. in
the Student Center.

Sheridan
Awarded

James Sheridan Jr., a
Washington and Lee University
senior, has been awarded a
Rotary Club grant for a year’s
study in Europe. The grant is
awarded to students through
the regional offices of the
Rotary Club.

Sheridan, the son of Mr. and

ington, has been on the dean’s
list at Washington and Lee since
entering the university as a
freshman. He is a member of
Phi Beta Kappa andis majoring
in chemistry and'physics.

Sheridan will ‘study at the
Niels.Bohr institute in
Copenhagen, ‘Denmark, with

Randy-Mac and Down the Road

It takes courage to get out of
bed with little sleep and a pain-
ful hangover, knowing that the
year’s first Economics test
awaits. The situation was not so
bleak last night when my
cronies informed me of a party
‘‘down the road.” Aware of my
priorities, it took 60 seconds of:
soul-searching to decide that
having attended class every
day was almost as good as stu-
dying. The only reason for
hesitation was that the party
was at the Pines at Randolph
Macon and Route 501 to Lynch-
burg is like picking your way
through a Pavillion party after
eight cups of grain.

For a road trip to be suc-
cessful, the proper supplies
must be procurred. Sufficient
quantities of cheap, but effi-
cient libation, and a modest
purchase from Super X Drugs
are advisable, if not vital. A fast
car with an 8track and an ex-
perienced guide who can
navigate the ;mountains at
outrageous speeds with no
hands are also necessary.
These qualifications met, our
expedition made its first stop at
the small Texaco station out-
side B.V.

“Is that bridge where we
were supposed to turn off?”

‘What? Oh..”

“Hey, you can’t back up on
this road.”’

“Watch me.”

A truck’s air horn sounded
and we all ducked, hoping the
beast wouldn’t see us. An
emergency roll right and we
came to a stop in a small field,
safe from danger as the red tail
lights disappeared over the
crest of the hill. A few precision
maneuvers later and we were
on the road again.

 

 

 

 

Correction

A story appearing in last
week’s Ring-tum Phi which said
that an SAE from Little Rock
was arrested for indecent ex-
posure was false. The Phi’s
staff wishes to apologize to the
person in question for any em-
barrassment the article may
have caused.

 

Opening the door released a

billow of smoke into the crisp
Lynchburg autumn air. Four of
us walked away from the car,
leaving two casualties slumber-
ing in the back - out for the
night. Three silhouetted figures
were discernible in the
distance; we looped toward
them, hopeful of begging in-
formation. ‘“‘Where...where..uh,
uh..where is, uh, Bell Dorm?
You know, the one with the din-
ing room in it.” Directions
freshly in mind, we made our
way to the building.

A rather obese, bovine look-
ing young maiden guarded the
entrance, exercising her only
option for the night: the study of
organic slime molds. The four
of us, ina dazed and bewildered
state, shuffled toward her con-
tenance. We stared at each
other, suppressing laughter,
while a brave member of our
party ventured a quarry.

“Uh, could you call Jamie
and tell her we’re here?”’

“Jamie who,”’ was the cold,
calloused reply.

“Oh, I don’t know. She lives
on the third floor. You know,
Jamie? She’s got blond hair
and big, uh, and she lives on the
third floor, I think.”

We never found Jamie, but no
matter, we pressed on to the
Pines.

There were many parties at
the infamous former sorority
houses that night, and finding
the right one was a chore that
taxed our combined resources
to the limit. The situation would
have been more easily handled
if we had been able to see, but
our tenacity of purpose prevail-

ed, and the proper party was
identified. Switching our
systems on overdrive, we
refueled on liquid courage, and
forged ahead into the unknown.

Courage reinstated, we divid-
ed forces and prepared for the
proverbial attack. Unfortunate-
ly for me, my intended victim
was better versed in the
rudiments of banal conversa-
tion than I, and my victory was
snatched by some _ upstart
freshman (just try to get a bid
now, buddy). There is only one
course of action in defeat and
that is to surrender to the God of
Human Waste Products and
join the ranks of the “wasted.”
With the background already
laid, this small task was easily
and quickly accomplished.

It has never ceased to amaze
me that Washington and Lee’s
fraternities persist in throwing
parties ‘down the road’’ for
girls who never attend.
Although perhaps a_ naive
assumption, one would think
that the girls might be so kind
as to grace our presence when
we bring the party to them. A
Sociology major should study
this phenomenon and publish
the results for the good of the
school.

And so the events leading to
my present dilemma have been
unraveled before your
disbelieving eyes. Yes, it takes
a lot of courage to take your
first Economics test of the year
with a hangover and four hours
of sleep - the kind of courage on-
ly the hard-core W&L student
possesses. But it is so much
easier to just roll over and bag
the test, and besides, I don’t feel
all that courageous anyway.

Republicans
hold picnic

by David Talley

Last Friday the College
Republicans held their annual
picnic in Woods Creek Meadow.
Membership chairman Mark
Mainwaring reports “‘the picnic
was a big success. There were
about 100 club members and 125
girls there.’’ The school’s
represented included Mary
Washington, Randolph-Macon,
Madison, Southern Seminary,
Longwood and Sweet Briar.

The club will now turn its at-
tention to the upcoming state
elections in November. ‘We
have already been working on
the campaign,” says Steve
Rodgers, campaign chairman,
“and we are in close contact
with the Dalton, Canada and
Coleman campaign camps. The
club will take its usual active
role in the area campaign ac-
tivities.”’ Rodgers stated that
the club has already completed
a campus voter canvass, and
conducted a bumper branding
with some Randolph-Macon
girls last Saturday in Lex-
ington. This Saturday bumper
branding is planned with
RMWC in Lynchburg, to be
followed by a touch football
game. |

ly a higher class of people”
were unfair, and that a law stu-
dent should be more careful
before making such statements.

Derek Swope, President of
the Third-Year Class and a
member of the Law School
Board of Governors, was also
concerned. He said, ‘‘Dan was
mad about his car but he did the
wrong thing. I don’t think he
was wise in what he said and he
didn’t speak for us all.”

On the other hand, Swope
said, “I do think the Ring-tum
Phi blew the letter out of pro-
portion by printing the cartoon
next to the letter. It was only
one person’s opinion and the
cartoon made it look like it was
the view of the whole law
school.

Mark Sharp, a second-year
student who graduated from
W&L, felt very much like
Swope. He thought the letter
was not good for relations bet-
ween the law school and
undergraduates, but he also felt
the Ring-tum Phi was _ir-
respossible in blowing it up the
way they did.

Sharp expressed a feeling
that seemed common around
Lewis Hall this week—that the
letter was only one person’s opi-
nion and that by the large, law

towards undergraduates.

In fact, a number of the law
students said they like
undergraduates. Four first-
year students who did their
undergraduate work at Virginia
said: “We are dependent on
them for our social lives. There
is nothing to do here.”’

 

A few said that the
undergraduates could cause
tensions at Lewis, particularly
when they use law student’s
carrels to study in. But many do
not mind undergrads using the
law library. One of the ex-
Wahoos joked: ‘‘These
undergrads study too much!
We’re always trying -to find a
way to goof off and here are
these undergrads booking
away.”

So relax, my _ fellow

‘undergrads! They think we’re

OK!

If you have nothing to do this
weekend -- no date, no combo,
no booze, no Penthouse -- you
might consider blowing a cou-
ple of bucks at the State where
the Bad News Bears latest
nothing, ‘‘Breaking Training’’,
is playing.

You remember our darlings.
They could make you laugh say-
ing “go to h--,”” warm your
heart yelling ‘‘f--off,’’ and br-
ing tears to your eyes when they
suggested that “‘eat s---.”” They
played like the old Mets (in fact
the new Mets, too), and
miraculously won a champion-
ship.

Well, our loveable kids are
back.

And boring.

Walter Mathau is gone, and so
is Tatum O’Neal.

And so is the need for the Bad
News Bears.

The new stars are William
Devane and Clifton James, who
hardly fill their roles as pivotal
characters with the pizazz need-
ed to bring interest to the au-
dience’s state of mind.
Although, with all due fairness
to our stars, there wasn’t much

began operations on Monday,
has added a few new shows and
will operate on some slightly
different principles according
to new general manager Bob
DeMaria.

“This year all department
heads (News, Music, Program-
ming) will answer directly to
the student station manager,
who will answer to me,” said
DeMaria. This will put more
responsibility in the hands of
the students. DeMaria also said
he will expect student directors
to be more responsible over
themselves and other workers
on the station. ‘“This will enable
the station to be an entertaining
experience as well as a learning
one,”’ he said.

Student Directors for this
year are: Mike Lavitt, acting
station manager and program
director; Ed Burgess, news
director ; Steve Mattesky, assis-
tant news director, and public
affairs director; Bruce Wilmot,
sports director; and Les Gillen,
music director. Gillen’s
assistants are Mark Mainwar-

ing who is in charge of Third,

Ear, and Rob Tremblay, who
handles classics along with Ty
York. Tom Wornam will be jazz
director. Tom Tinsley is chief
engineer.

DeMaria said that as far as
programming goes, there will
be more bluegrass as well as a
little more classical and light
jazz. ‘‘Two new Sides”’ is back,
along with a new feature on 91.5
FM called ‘‘In Concert,”’ a show
which will feature live albums,
highlighted by interviews with
name rock groups hosted by
Mark Mainwaring.

Land o

in the script to help them bring
a greater interest in our heroes.

Our story is about the Bears’
(California State Little League
Champs) trek (in a stolen van)
to Houston where they are to
play a game against the Texas
L. L. champs in the Houston
Astrodome. (This ridiculous
idea was promoted by a Texan
beer tycoon.) The team,
through great effort, manages
to forget how to bat a ball, catch
a ball, and walk straight. They
pick up a kid who says he has a
delivery like Tom Seaver, that
turns out to be more like a milk
man’s. In addition, the team’s
star player looks up to his long
lost father (who, of course,
becomes the team’s coach), and
we are witnesses to the usual
trials and tribulations that oc-
cur before a father-son recon-
ciliation.

Well, our pitcher finally
learns how to pitch, and the
team remembers how to field,
and we are presented your
typical, suspense-filled come-
from-behind victory.

Wow.

The only feeling the viewer

WLUR, 91.5 on your dial, will
also carry home W&L Generals
football, basketball, and last
but not least, lacrosse games.
Doug Harwood’s ‘‘Anti-
headache machine” is back
along with another new addi-
tion, “Open Ear,” a show
featuring little known artists.
DeMaria also noted that a lot of
syndicated things from Na-
tional Public Radio, the

Longhorn Radio Network, and |!"

the Virginia Tech Radio Net-
work will be aired.

Both the New York Philhar-
monic, and the Metropolitan
Opera will be _ presented,
hopefully with better reception
this year, according to
DeMaria.

“‘We also hope to do a series ©

with Clark Mollenhoff in which
he discusses current issues and
events, a feature also to be car-
ried on Cable nine,’ said
DeMaria. Besides teaching at
W&L, Mollenhoff is a noted col-
umnist and observer of the
government scene, particularly
corrupt politicians and govern-
ment agencies.

DeMaria said he is looking for |
some business in the area to.
underwrite some special pro- '
gramming he has in mind. In |

addition DeMaria said, ‘‘We’re
looking forward to a tighter

and.professional sound that can |

be a credit to this school and the
community it serves.’’DeMaria
also emphasized that WLUR-
FM, 91.5, is an alternative
source of programming, and we
are not going to do what
everybody else does.”’

Oz

has when he leaves the theater
is that of being ripped-off.

With exception of two or three
fleetingly good moments, there
was nothing to get excited
about. The script was dull, and
all the old gags (especially the
mis-played ground balls) that
were so cute the first time
around got tiring after the first
5 seconds. Even the big climax
-- the game at the Astrodome --
wasn’t as suspenseful as it
should have been.

Actually, I wouldn’t go so far
as to say the “Bad News Bears
in Breaking Training’’ was bad.
Nor would I say that it was
anywhere near good.

It was.....nothing.

Usually not one to pick on
freshmen, I would like to thank
the animals of that breed for
making last Wednesday night’s
viewing at the Lyric a truly
nauseating experience for me
and all the other patrons pre-
sent.... Lynn Anderson is get-
ting a divorce, and nobody
cares.

Happy birthday,
HALE

ye and Ear:
from the Bookstore

by Betty Munger
The editorial in last week’s

students bursting with intellec-
tual enthusiasm and curiosity.
It seems that academic red tape
and Catch-22’s are preventing
these lively minds from exercis-
ing to full capacity.

Ten years ago, Washington
and Lee, foreseeing this un-
fortunate situation, established
the Bookstore to offer areas of
satisfaction for such intellec-
tual frustrations. Books: a wide
range of subjects ready to be
explored. No prerequisites (ex-
cept, of course, an interest in
reading) no distribution re-
quirements or linked courses,
etc.

Just think of the advantage of
books over professors. Books
are a pure distillation of all day-

after-day classroom lectures.
Books can be listened to at any
hour, day or night and are
highly portable. Books don’t get
colds with sneezings and

‘*coughings. One can stay in bed
. at 8:00 a.m. - with a book. Books

do not appear in an exhausted
condition after an all-nighter
with a new baby. One can look
ahead - even skip pages - in a
book; or flip backwards to
check on what happened
earlier. You can drop-ad a book
without slips or signatures.

Professors can seldom pour
out jewel-like phrases hour
after hour but books are bright
with them - nor, if I may be par-
doned the expression, can you
curl up with a professor.

And yet, and yet! Next week
we'll give equal time to the pro-
position that professors are bet-
ter than books.

successful solo careers as well
as first-chair positions with ma-
jor symphony and chamber or-
chestras. . . William McCorkle
and Walter Chestnut are
familiar to Lexington au-
diences. McCorkle will perform
the Poulenc Organ Concerto
and Chestnut will perform the
Haydn Trumpet Concerto.

The Theater Chamber
Players will perform music by
Bach, Boccherini, Webern and
Ligeti.

Richard Collins has perform-
ed extensively in Europe and
has appeared in concert on
television and radio in this
country. His program will con-
sist of works by Berg,
Schoenberg, Busoni and Ives.

THE

RING-TUM PHI

Generals Repeat
Losing Ways

by Pete Abitane

While it looked for quite
awhile that the Generals would
enjoy for the first time this
season the thrill of victory, it
somehow slipped from their
grasp and turned into the ugly
agony of defeat. In a game that
saw the W&L defense play the
best it has all year, the offense
coughed up the ball on six occa-
sions. The crowd stood up and
cheered for the first time since
lacrosse season, and a bizarre
play that has become a General
trademark, also saw a
mediocre Centre College team
come out on top Saturday, 14-13.

After a scoreless first
quarter, Centre began a drive
that culminated in a play wor-
thy of the ‘Most incredible play
of the year’ award. Blessed with
good field position at the W&L
35, Centre mounted their at-
tack. With second and eight,
quarterback Rick Riney com-
pleted a pass to wing-back Mike
Gosset who made a nifty run of
eighteen yards but fumbled on
the Generals’ fifteen yard line.
At least three W&L defenders
missed an opportunity to be the
hero and Centre split end Mike
Clontz fell on the loose ball in
the end zone for an easy six
points. Curt Grider kicked the
PAT and Centre went into the
locker room with a 7-0 lead.

But transformations often
happen in locker rooms, and the
Generals came out to play their
most inspiring defense of the

year. A jarring tackle by Carl
Folcik on the Colonels first of-
fensive play of the second half
ignited one of the most intense
flows of emotion ever witnessed
on Wilson Field. With W&L
manhandling the offense and
controlling the momentum,
they were well on their way toa
thirteen point third quarter.

The Generals capped their
first scoring drive of the day on
the running of freshman Karl
Cheatham. Scampering around
right end, he cut back against
the grain and galloped to a 65
yard touchdown. That play in-
cidentally, was the longest
since Randy Broyles ran 77
yards for a TD vs. Virginia in
1951. In addition, Cheatham’s
132 yards on 18 carries for a
single game rushing total is se-
cond only to Tom Van Am-
burgh’s 172 yards which
ironically also came at the
hands of Centre. Danny Thomp-
son provided the extra point and
tied game at 7-7.

The Generals continued to ap-
ply the pressure. After a 47 yard
field goal attempt by Thompson
went wide left, Kevin McGowan
intercepted a Riney pass and
returned it 25 yards to the Cen-
tre 10. Hissey picked up 6 yards
on an option right and one play
later Cheatham once again
went over for the score, this
time on a sweep left. However,
what turned out to be the
crucial PAT went wide.

W&L Harriers
Fall Short

by Chris Clements

Washington and Lee opened
its 1977 Cross Country season
here Saturday defeating three
of its four opponents in the four-
way meet. Davis and Elkins
paced by Mike Redman, who
placed first, managed to hang
on to the overall victory with a
score of 33 points. W&L with 38
points was second. Shepherd
College was a distant third with
66 points followed by Liberty
Baptist with 99, and West
Virginia Tech with Il0 points.

Bob Bates was the first
General to finish. He placed se-
cond overall. Following Bates
were Richard Bird in fourth,
Allen Weeks sixth, Chris Daniel
eight, and Brian Adams,
Washington and Lee’s fifth
man, placing I8th overall.

Washington and Lee had an
opportunity to sweep the
quadangular meet if Hans
Furuland had not been forced to
drop out of the race some 300

yards from the finish line.
Furuland, a native of Sweden,
was unaccustomed to the heat
and collapsed rounding the first
turn of the final 440 yards.
Furuland was rushed to the
hospital, treated for heat ex-
haustion, and discharged from
the hospital that evening. He
would have placed tenth, had he
been able to finish the race at a
jog, giving the Generals the
overall victory in the meet.

Bob Bates pointed out that
almost everyone was affected
by the heat. He said, when you
run in the afternoon in the heat
it usually shaves a minute off
your time. Bates personally
doesn’t mind running in the
heat. He also points out that
everyone has to adjust to the
heat, and that it’s a great feel-
ing to finish the race before
cheering fans at a football
game. The best time to run a
cross-country meet is around 10
o'clock in the morning.

Generals soaked
in opener

Varsity water polo, W&L’s
newest of thirteen inter-
collegiate sports opened the
season last weekend competing
in a Southern League Tourna-
ment at the University of Rich-
mond.

Coach Bill Stearns called the
tourney a good opportunity to
see just how W&L’s young team
would do against top flight com-
petition. The polo Generals first
game was against very for-
midable East Carolina, and
they came out on the short end
of a 24-8 final score. W&L used
various combinations on of-
fense and defense, and ex-
pecially in goal where Bill
Meyer is out witha injury.

The Generals lost their se-
cond game to the University of

Richmond’s ‘A’ team, the
defending state champion, 8-5,
but showed signs of improve-
ment. That improvement was
very evident in the team’s third
game of the tournament against
the U of R’s “B” team, the
same team that finished third in
last year’s state championships
behind the Richmond ‘‘A”’ team
and ‘W&L. The Generals won
their first intercollegiate con-
test 15-6.

Freshman Will Hodges ap-
pears to have won the first team
goalie position as he came in
very well in the final two
games. Scott Duff and Biff Mar-
tin did well on offense for W&L,
while Drew Pillsbury, Chip
Hoke, and transfer Mike Foley

WIN

his superb ball-handling, dribbl-
ed past the Radford fullback on
the right wing. He shot the ball
towards the left side of the net
past the goalie. Stone, in an in-
surance move typical of a winn-
ing soccer team, poked the ball
in.

After the first goal the Rad-
ford team came out snarling.
But the Generals defense,
which was later refered to as
tenacious, solid, and _ stingy,
stopped them. Radford tried to
beat the fullbacks by playing

longball. They would chip the .

ball over the Generals’ heads
and try winning the ensuing
race towards the goal. The
W&L fullbacks would either
out-muscle them, or Kevin
Carney or Mark Bennett, who
shared the goal-tending, would
stop the shot.

In the second half the
Generals continued to control
the game. While Radford was
tired out by its all-out effort in
the first half, the W&L team
was able to out-hustle the op-
position. Practicing the team ef-
fort Coach Piranian refers to,
the Generals played a
deliberate passing game.

Their cooperation was
rewarded about 20 minutes into
the second half. Dave Williams
scored off a chip-shot by Collier.
Dave Samuelson scouped up a
loose ball on the left side of the
opponents’ goal. He passed it
along the front of the goal. Col-
lier received the ball on the
right side and kicked it into the
air. Williams headed the ball in.
Williams also scored the winn-
ing goal against Virginia
Wesleyan a week before on a
head ball.

Coach Piranian feels he has
solved the major problems of
the team. And it appears he
has; eight goals in three games,
the defense has yet to be scored
on, and the team. already has
three wins. Piranian’s pre-
season goals; are ac-
complishable by this team. The
goals were; score more than 13
goals, allow less than 37 goals,
and win more than three
games. However, the toughest
competition is still ahead.

Losing ways

continued from page 6

At this point it looked as
though the Generals were going
to run Centre right back to Dan-
ville, Ky. But at this point W&L
did not resemble the con-
fident team of a year ago that
won four of its last five games.
Hissey and Cheatham both
received shoulder injuries on
the touchdown drive and with
their departure so went the
Generals’ momentum.

Centre took the opening
fourth quarter kickoff and mar-
ched 52 yards in ten plays with
freshman runningback Stan
Tracht taking it in from three
yards out. Grider provided the
extra point and lead 14-13.

With eight minutes remaining
and the good fortune of a poor
Centre punt, W&L had the ball
on the Colonels 26 first and ten.
However, a costly fumble, one
of six on the day, destroyed the
chance of an almost certain
field goal.

After a tough defensive stand,
W&L once again had the ball,
this time on their own 29. Witha
combination of freshmen Chris
Leiser and Scott Swope repilac-
ing Hissey at quarterback, the
Generals failed to utilize their
remaining time-outs and thus
ran out of time—The generals
had agonizing losers 14-13.

The average reader might be
inclined to think that the
Generals should have won their
third game of the year, and they
well should have. But the fact
remains that any team which
commits eight turnovers, (six
fumbles and two interceptions)
would not stand much of a
chance with even Lexington
High. Why with only fifty
seconds left in the half and the
ball on their own twenty did the
Generals choose to run out the
clock instead of time-outs and
sideline passes to move at least
within field goal range? Why
with a minute and a half left in
the game did they choose to
keep the ball on the ground and
once again disregard their
quota of time-outs?

It is not the intent of this col-
umn to offer answers to these
questions, nor pass judgement
on players and coaches.
However, it is well within the
prerogative of this article to
make the following observation.

Washington and Lee has
assembled this year the finest

football personnel since the
glory days of the early sixties. A
very talented group on paper, it
is now time to shun the large
egos and high esteem that have
been created by such com-
ments. It is time to go out on
Saturday and beat the living
daylights out of someone! It is
high time that this gifted group
of athletes reject and cancel
memories as well as
forethoughts of the agony of
defeat and begin revelling and
anticipating the thrill of vic-
tory! Only then will the
monotonous practices seem
worth it and the foresight of
others be confirmed that this is
indeed a fine football team.

Loss of key players
won't hurt tennis team

by Jim Barnes
In the midst of the departure
of Dee Keesler and Richard
Makepeace, last year’s number
four and five singles players
respectively, Coach Dennis
Bussard predicts a_ losing
season for his team which tied
for second in the Division III
playoffs last May. Bussard
said, “I don’t expect a winning
season, and I don’t really care.”’
The only courts Keesler and
Makepeace will be playing on
this spring are the slow red clay
courts in Germany and
Spain as they are spending
the academic spring semester
abroad. Both were given the op-
portunity to participate on this
year’s fall team, and in the spr-
ing up to the time they left. To
their credit they voluntarily
declined to go out for the team.
They did not want to keep a
space on the team and the
valuable match experience that
goes with it from another player
who'd be holding down that spot
come April and May, when the
bulk of the team matches are
played.

year’s second place team in its

division would be ebullient over
the prospects for this year’s
team. Not Bussard. Why?
Coach Bussard is quick to point
out the kind of teams that are on
this year’s schedule. There are
19 Division I teams on this
year’s schedule, along with five
Division II or III teams that
were involved in post season
play last year.

Bussard believes that by
playing tough teams during the
regular season the players will
be better prepared for the
playoffs, from whence national
recognition derives. His theory
has some merit as evidenced by
the General’s results last year.
The Generals had a mediocre
14-13 regular season record, but
went on to tie for second place
in the Division III playoffs last
May. ‘‘Anyway,’’ Bussard says,
“tennis isn’t a team sport. It’s
an individual sport. I don’t like
team records. The whole thing
is competition, good competi-
tion for the national champion-
ships.”’

When asked how the absence

would affect the team’s showing
this year Bussard responded,
“They'll definitely be missed
during the regular season, but
in the playoffs, I don’t know.”’
One should keep in mind that of
the 12 points that W&L
garnered in the playoffs, All-
Americans Ben Johns and
Stewart Jackson won nine of the
General’s 12 points. A point total
of nine would have W&L tied
for third in last year’s playoffs.

A good recruiting year for the
team is another reason for op-
timism in this year’s post
season play. Among this year’s
crop of newcomers is freshman
Cody Davis. Davis was a high
school All American, and one of
the top Florida juniors. He is
currently playing number three
singles on the fall tennis team.
Bussard thinks that this young
man ‘‘could be just as good as
last year’s number three
player, Ken Voelker, if not bet-
ter by the time of the playoffs
beginning at Ohio Wesleyan on
May 17-20.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

It seems as though Dan Scott has hit upon a solution for many of
our entertainment woes here at W&L: Take some of the entertain-
ment scheduling power the SAB now has and give it to people more
knowledgeable about music and perhaps more capable of con-
sistently booking good acts into the Cockpit. From the last time that
Lee fed Traveler a sugar cube to the present, the SAB has had a vir-
tual monopoly over how we are entertained, and who entertains us.
It should be evident to all that satisfaction does not run rampant.

We question the rationale behind continually booking soul acts
for a student body which consistently states a ‘‘rock’’ preference
from year to year in the SAB entertainment survey. It can be
argued that a washed out ‘‘name” soul band was booked for
homecoming because of the traditional 40 kegs of beer, and for
economy reasons. But this year when it was discovered that
homecoming was to be dry, no attempt was made to get a higher
quality act. The reason now becomes the importance of having a
name band that is recognizable to the student body, and since
‘‘name’”’ rock bands are so expensive, AB&D was signed.

The problem for us with this is that we can’t really appreciate a
group of old men from Houston, Texas. I point out more pro-
gressive homecomings of the past. In the early 70’s, the Allman
Brothers Band, J. Geils Band, and the Ear] Scruggs Revue played
at homecoming dances. Granted, W&L did get them on their way
up to the top and at the time they were unknown, but they are ob-
viously not soul bands. It seems strange that we could get quality
entertainment back then, but find it so difficult to do now,

So we say, ‘‘Give Dan Scott’s PM club the money to get started.”
It doesn’t have to be $33,000. They probably would not ask for that
amount anyway. After they got on their feet, the program would
probably support itself. And in the process, please and entertain
plenty of people. If it did succeed in bringing top quality acts to
campus, it would almost surely put pressure on the SAB to compete
with the PMC and force the SAB to consistently seek out and pro-
vide top quality entertainment for the W&L community,

Tradition continues to remain an important aspect of this fine old
institution. A prime example of this is the football team’s tradition
of losing. The student body has come to expect a nonwinning
season. From the football team and from the team’s showing in the
first three games, it looks like we won't be disappointed.

The team has not really looked bad. In fact, the offense has im-
proved since last year, and the defense has been steadily improving
this year. Against Lock Haven State, no matter how corny it
sounds, it seemed as if the time really did run out on the Generals.
We were definitely outclassed against Davidson, to the point that
they should never have been scheduled. Though these two games
were host, we really can’t feel too upset about them.. The team
played as well as could be expected under the circumstances.

What we can be upset about is the loss of the last game to Centre
College. The Generals played well for most of the game; perhaps
the best they have played all year, Then finding themselves behind
by one point with three minutes to go, they gave the game away
under the direction of the coaching staff. Why the coaches elected
to put in a freshman quarterback to run the option play when the
outcome of the game was still undecided is a perturbing question.

No matter how good a runner Leiser is, and this is not to take
anything away from him, a freshman backup QB whose only play-
ing experience this year has been as a running back, should not
have been given the job of directing the offense at such a crucial
time. There is just too much pressure in a situation like that to put
upon his shoulders, But even more importantly, a passing strategy
was called for, and our team sources have said that Leiser is just
not competent in this area.

The second string QB Scott Swope is supposed to be a competent
passer. Swope is a junior, who, if not anything else, has two more
years of maturity than a freshman. Granted, Swope does not have
much play time experience (and we question this due to'this year’s
record), but he is a passer and a passer was needed in this par-
ticular situation, We are not suggesting that the game would
definitely have been won had Swope been put in immediately after
Hissey’s injury, but our chances almost undoubedly would have
been increased. The coaches did put Swope in to do what Leiser
couldn’t, but there were only 29 seconds left on the clock.

This indecision and misdecision is reminiscent of the 1975 Centre
College game when after being behind 9-3, the Generals scored with
seconds remaining on the clock, and the coaches elected to try out
their two point conversion play instead of going for the almost sure
win by kicking the extra point, Another case is last year at
Hampden-Sydney when coaching indecision concerning what was
going. on on the field when a field goal was obviously called for and
the coaches’s lack of concentration led to a delay of game penalty,
which resulted in a short field goal attempt.

The coaching staff has been out to lunch. There is no coordination
and communication between the coaches. Indecision is com-
monplace, not rare, It appears that the team has no coaching
leadership, as evidenced by the above games which resulted in not-
ches for the lost column. The head coach is supposed to make the
important decisions when they need to be made, not just concern
himself with the defensive backfield. Coach McHenry, where are
you when you are needed?

The team has the potential to have a winning season this year.
But we wonder whether tradition will be broken unless some
leadership decisions or changes are made. JIM.

Dear Editor:

I wish to clarify the article
concerning the Student Ac-
tivities Board (SAB) which ap-
peared in the Ring-tum Phi on
16 September 1977. I provided
information addressing three
issues: a loan to a student for
personal use, SAB security of
gate receipts, and SAB accoun-
ting practices.

Information came to me last
May that irregularities existed
in the handling of SAB money. I
spoke with several members of
the Board and then asked for all
Board records. I was told that
receipts for all expenditures

‘had been removed from the
SAB office and destroyed. I was
then given all disbursement
vouchers and the Board’s ac-
count book.

I discovered a disbursement
voucher signed by John Berley,
dated 9 March 1977, authorizing
a check payable to Charlie
Hulfish, The voucher stated
that the money was a loan for
housing and was to be repaid in
two weeks. I considered this

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

personal loan a gross abuse ot
discretion and trust by the in-
dividuals and felt a duty to
disclose this information. The
loan has since been repaid with
interest,

I was told by SAB members
that monies received at Board
events were often stored in the
SAB office overnight; at times,
sizeable sums were left there.
Board members told me that
money disappeared on different
occasions and that losses caus-
ed the Board to store the money
elsewhere. These were the
reports of stealing mentioned in
the article. I did not state that
Board members took money.
The evidence is that money was
placed in the office, and some of
it was gone at next counting.
The EC has now required the
SAB to make night deposits at a
local bank of all money taken in
at Board events.

The Board kept disbursement
vouchers and receipts for all ex-
penditures and maintained an
accounting. The practice of the
SAB was to throw out old

 

receipts at the end of the year
because they take up space. The
practice, apparently accepted
in the past by the EC and the
SAB, frustrates substantiation
of expenditures. For example,
checks were drawn to Messrs.
Armstrong and Berley, as
reported, and to other students
for what I believe were SAB
purposes, The problem created
by the absence of receipts,
however, is that many of the ex-
penditures cannot be verified.
The EC has therefore required
all student organizations to re-
tain receipts for all expen-
ditures.

A side point: the article
stated that I said SAB members
had private parties at the stu-
dent fund’s expense. This was a
statement by my source, a
member of the SAB, and has not
been substantiated by concrete
evidence at this:time. To my
knowledge, Messrs. Armstrong
and Berley carried out their
duties as SAB co-chairmen with
honesty. I trust that this ac-
count has clarified the matter.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Editor:

I feel that it is necessary that
I state my opinion in reference
to the letter of Mr. Daniel G.
Beyer, of the School of Law.
What he has done is to impugn
the honor of the entire
undergraduate student body.

He is an intermediate law stu-
dent, who still has not . learned
the first rule of law; that a per-
son is presumed innocent until
proven guilty. Yet he, through
what must be considered omnis-
cient knowledge, has found the
whole of the undergraduate
classes guilty. The verdict of
guilty is unfounded because it is
supported by no evidence what-
soever, bar that of the bigoted
opinion on his part toward any
student who is not in the Law
School. His statement, and I
quote, ‘‘One of my classmates
would have told me, but not an
undergraduate,”’ not only pro-
ves the stupidity of Mr. Beyer,
but also that he is uninformed
as to the caliber of the student
body.

When Mr. Beyer, starts his
condemnation of the Honor
System, he demonstrates that it
is not the undergraduates who
do not abide by it. He finds fault
with the Honor System in
reference to the
undergraduates; I find fault
with him. He says he never
worked under an Honor System
and that fact is evident, because
no gentleman would ever make
such totally unfounded allega-
tions. He is no gentleman.

If Mr. Beyer is representative
of the Law School, then I am
glad to be an undergraduate. If
he is not, then the Law School
has my deepest sympathies for
having to count him as one of
their number, |

Sincerely,
Joseph D. Sloboda ‘81

Dear Mr. Beyer,

After reading your letter I
could not help:but be astounded
and amazed) at what you
‘higher types’ use for thinking.
It seemed to’ me most signifi-
cant that your letter of accusa-
tion without proof whould ap-
pear in the same issue that the
facts of the “‘unrepayed loan’”’
incident with Mr. Hulfish
become public. Your letter is
but another accusation in lieu of
fact. This is against the
American way, and against the
American legal process as set
forth in the U.S. Constitution,
the understanding of which is
why you are at Law School. So
what are you doing over there?
First Mr. Goddard, and then
you start throwing around un-
proved accusations. Guilty until
proven innocent is a standard
policy of Soviet Russia and
other police states, which this is
not! In fact, in America, these

type of accusations get lawyers —

in big trouble every year, so I

advise some discretion in your

snap judgements. I leave you

with one thought, oh wise

one...Who would steal a law
book but a law student?

Constitutionally,

Reynolds ‘‘Ace’’ Dobs ‘78

P.S. Was your car parked il-
legally? Sounds like it.

Dear Editor,

In response to Mr. Dan
Beyer’s comments in the last
issue:

What a crock of manure! I’ve
seen better reasoned and more
mature writings on bathroom
stalls. Mr. Beyer’s letter makes
two basic claims. The first is
that law students are more
honest than the undergrads.
The second is that they are,
somehow, more mature. The
letter only disapproves both of
these assertions. It is not honest
to indict all W&L undergrads
for damage to his car, nor is it
the product of a seasoned
thought process. It is, to coin a
phrase, all sound and fury, and
as such cannot signify law
school opinion.

As a first-year law student, I

am not so far removed from my

humble origins as Mr. Beyer’s
letter might suggest he is. I
wish to apologize for the bom-
bastic outburst printed last
week. It is an apology based on
a desire to communicate. It is
not based on embarrassment,
for it could only embarrass if it
were an accurate picture of law
school opinion.

It is to be hoped that this sort
of condescending puffery will
not recur. It serves no purpose.
Worse, it feeds a prejudice
which can only exist in an ig-
norant host organism.

John Fraser

Editor, Ring-tum Phi

This letter is in response to
that of Daniel G. Beyer, ‘79L. I,
too, write with deep regret.

The injury to his car, I do not
doubt, was extensive, and the
failure to as much as apologize
and offer to make restitution is
reprehensible.

However, what makes Mr.
Beyer so certain that an
undergraduate was to blame?
While I would not even want to
try to say that every
undergraduate at Washington
and Lee is as pure as the driven
snow, neither do I believe that
every student in the School of
Law is “simply of a higher
caliber.”’

Perhaps one of his classmates
hit Mr. Beyer’s car, but suppos-
ing that it was the property of
an undergraduate said student
felt an apology or restitution to
a sppiled rich brat of a lower
caliber would not be in order. I

can almost imagine such a

thought going through Mr.
Beyer’s mind if he were to hit

an undergraduate’s car.

As to the party last year, in
which a student was ‘sauteed
by his ‘gentleman’ friends,”’ I
agree with Mr. Beyer. Such ac-
tion is unpardonable in a
“gentleman’s school.”’ RtP
letter-add one

It is easy to see the bad side of
anything, and Mr. Beyer has
selected a good example of it.
But not all of us are like that.

So, my final observation to
Mr. Beyer is this. There are
jerks on both sides of the fence.
Try to pick and choose, because
not all of us on this side of the
creek would act as you have
depicted us, and perhaps some
of the people on your side of the
eek would.

Sincerely,
Douglass W. Dewing, ‘77

Dear Editor,

It is with great glee that I feel
the need to write this letter.
How often does anyone, much
less a law student (i.e. higher
caliber ego) leave himself ab-
solutely naked to the scorching
pens of (we. inferior
undergrads? My answer is not
very often, so thank you, Daniel
G. Beyer, yet to attain es-
quireship.

Beyer’s letter in last weeks
Phi was something I thought no
future lawyer could write.
Never let it be said that a mere
“boy who will be a_ boy”
reminded him that our legal
framework is based on a simple
idea: the undergraduate body
at W&L is innocent until proven
guilty. I suggest Beyer contact
his insurance company and stop
hurling blanket insults at the
honor code, the E.C., and all

' undergrads. Need I remind him

that there are many more of us
than him.

Now let it not be said that I
am making light of his misfor-
tune (the accident), or his mis-
judgement (writing the letter).
I seriously grieve his inconve-
nience. In the last few years he
and his fellow law students,
especially on the E.C.,.have
become more involved in
general campus life. Some
might not like this trend. I
myself point to the fact that we
have built them a brand new
law school, isolated from the
rest of the campus, and that this
is assuredly where he and the
capable women in the law
school belong.

Lastly I would like to point out
that his Zeus caliber cronies
make up a sizable percentage of
those living in Woods Creek.
The road in front of Woods
Creek is used primarily by law
students going to and from their
Olympus. Maybe one of them
had a little too much ambrosia
that Saturday night. Even the
real gods of the real Olympus
were known to imbibe in excess
occasionally. The cocktail party
the Dean of the Law School
gave that Saturday night must
have been a_— Good-

Tothe editor:

While’ Mr. Beyer’s_ un-
fortunate letter comes close to
making an ass of the rest of us
at the law school, it unques-
tionably makes a total ass of
him.

First: Mr. Beyer implies that
he knows certain offences com-
mitted against him were the
acts of undergraduates. But
how does Mr. Beyer know this?
He offers not a _ shred of
evidence to back his inference.
And, as every entering law stu-
dent quickly learns, drawing
conclusions without presenta-
tion of supporting facts is sim-
ple supposition.

Second: Mr. Beyer boldly
declares law students “are
simply a higher class of peo-
ple,” leaving the negative im-
plication from the context that
undergraduates constitute
W&L’s low class. But, as Mr.
Beyer will learn as he delves
deeper into his study of law,

generalizations are fraught
with possibilities of unfairness.
While Mr. Beyer professes to
reject the values of what he
terms a “‘southern gentlemen’s
school,”’ it is nonetheless un-
fortunate that his remarks
reveal all the certain earmarks

of bigotry.

The irony of Mr. Beyer’s let-
ter is perhaps that instead of
showing the superiority of the
mind of a law student he shows
only how little he himself has
absorbed of the law’s teaching.

Sincerely,
Robert Wise, Law II football

To the editor:

I would like to take this op-
portunity to address our grad
from Whatsamatta U. who is
now attending our law school. It
seems our boy, Danny, was
foolish enough to park his car in
a dangerous area on the road-
way which services the Woods
Creek Apartments.

Notwithstanding the fact that
no ten-year old cerebral palsy
victim would even consider
parking a tricycle at that spot,
Danny was “‘disgusted’’ to find
his left quarter panel bashed in.
Since it couldn’t have been a
citizen of Lexington, nor a con-
struction worker, and by no
means -- God forbid -- a law stu-
dent, our boy decided that it
was a typical violation of the
honor code (no note being at-
tached to the mangled car) as
committed by a W&L
undergrad.

Young Daniel also informed
us, through his literal work of
art, that an _ undergrad
(unknown to him, God, or
anyone else, for that matter)
has previously relieved him of a
law book and valuables such as
two empty stereo speaker
boxes.

Now, grant you, the Honor
Code is not in the healthiest of
conditions, and I at times have
been disappointed at the occa-
sional break-down of moral
fibre in our student body, but I
think it might be time that this
shlepp of an excuse for a law
student learn the major princi-
ple of our judicial system. That
being the accused is ‘innocent
until proven guilty.”’

It is hard for me to imagine
any undergrad stealing a law
book, except, maybe, to use as a
doormat. I can’t say I’d blame.
anyone -- janitor, undergrad,
mutt -- for throwing away a pair
of empty speaker boxes that
were probably blocking a
hallway, although I would
highly consider sending anyone
who would consider this an
outrageous honor violation to
Dr. Worth for an emergency ex-
amination. Moreover, I’d think
before I accused anyone --
group or individual -- of a crime
as serious as the one that oc-
curred in this case.

The only group I can blame
for this incident is the law
school. However, I will say no
more. After all, it is the law
school administrators, faculty
and students who must
(hopefully) bear the embar-
rassment of the fact that this

-moron was admitted in the first

place.

weekend at ODU in Virginia
Beach. Last weekend the
Generals played in the Navy In-
vitational Tournament .at An-
napolis. Johns and Jackson both
reached the semi-finals of their
respective brackets. The team
as a whole finished fourth out of
five teams competing. Navy
finished first followed by W&M,
MD, W&L, and Swarthmore.

Bussard is not enthusiastic
over the idea of fall tennis.
“Tennis is a year-round sport
these days,’ says Bussard.
‘“‘You’re forced to keep up if you
want to have a good team.”
Bussard is particularly critical
of holding the state champion-
ship tournament in the fall.
Bussard said the tournament
should be held the first week of
May when the players are at the
peak of their game. One thing is
certain though of the fall season
for the Generals. Having played
Maryland twice, Virginia twice,
Navy, Ohio University, and last
year’s Division II] champs
Swarthmore, to name a few;
the Generals will be used to
playing tough teams.

Coach Miller was very pleas-
ed with the team performance.
This year’s squad, according to
Miller, has better overall
balance than last year’s team.
This balance can be attributed
to the fact that four out of the

Rush
Violations

depend on the outcome of
Wednesday’s Student Affairs
Committee meeting.

When asked about the severi-
ty of fines for major violations,
Judiciary Board Member Steve
Jones commented, ‘Things
have been lax for so long, that
we decided to tighten up before
violations get out of hand. If the
frats cooperate, then maybe we
can slack up later (on the
severity of fines).”’

One interesting note is the
lack of ‘‘contact” or what is
commonly called ‘‘dirty rush”
violations. This is not to say that
there have not been any com-
mitted, but thus far no fines
have been levied for such of-
fenses. In comparison, last year
there were over $300 in contact
violation fines. This would tend
to support the IFC position that
the implementing of stiff fines
the first time discourages fur-
ther infractions.

Computer crime: What’s the answer

by Neil Cote

James Madison University
was named the winner in the
varsity division during a series
of debates held on _ the
Washington and Lee campus
last weekend. Bridgewater Col-
lege finished first in the novice
division. Twelve colleges, from
Virginia and _ surrounding
States, completed in the events.
W&L was merely the host,
since its debate team has not
yet been organized.

The topic of the weekend’s
debates concerned methods of
combating white collar crime,
mainly the widespread practice
of unscrupulous use of com-

puters in order to reap profits il-

legally.

Madison University and
William & Mary College,
by virtue of victories
in the opening rounds,
competed in the varsity finals.
Madison’s two contestants,
Mark Reissinger and William
Mitchell, played the affirmative
role during the final. debate.
Basing their argpments that
present day methods of ap-
prehending white collar
criminals are both inadequate
and impractical, they ad-
vocated the ,use of new
technology, including the use of
legal tapping devices in order to
gain the evidence necessary to
arrest people involved in
fraudulent practices.

Donald Henderson and Nancy
Short, both from W&M, oppos-
ed the stand taken by Madison.

They criticized the use of ultra-
modern technology as being in
league with George Orwell’s
“Big Brother’’ and ‘‘a complete
invasion of privacy.’’ Hender-

Man’s best friends.

son and Miss Short suggested
that special schools could be
started and funded by the
LEAA which could teach police
and law enforcers how to detect
computer related crimes
without having to resort to the
use of new equipment which
‘would endanger the concept of
democracy as we now know it.”’

Each of the four debaters was
allowed ten minutes to deliver
his opening speech. After the in-
itial speeches, five minutes at
the podium was given to each
debater so he could defend his
previous statements. Miss
Short was the first one to speak
and she again pointed out the
practicality of ‘‘police schools”

 

‘*...eriticized the use of
ultramodern technology as be-
ing in league with ‘George
Orwell's Big Brother...”

 

as a possible deterent to com-
puter crimes. ‘The LEAA
spends $40 million annually for
criminal investigations,’’ she
said. ‘‘Certainly they would be
willing to fund schools where
police could learn means of
detecting white collar
criminals.”

Reissinger was next on the
stand and he retorted that the
LEAA has done very little in ac-
tually decreasing corruption in
big businesses and unless new
technology was put to use for
crime detection, law enforcers
would not be able to accumulate

thé necessary evidence to pro-
secute white collar criminals.

Henderson and Mitchell then
took their turns speaking, both
of them echoing their respec-
tive teammates’ views. Hender-
son backed up Miss Short on her
suggestion of ‘‘special police
schools’ and Mitchell stated
perhaps the best argument
against W&M’s stand. He
declared, ‘Unless we have in-
vestigative technology superior
to the computer practices
employed by businessmen, we
will be helpless in impeding the
growth of fraudulant use of
computers.”

The results of the debates
were announced in Payne Hall
by Halford Ryan, Professor of
English at W&L. In the novice
division, Bridgewater narrowly
outpointed Alderson Rod and
Old Dominion. VMI and the
West Virginia University round-
ed off the top five.

As expected, Madison was
declared the winner in the var-
sity division as the team of Mit-
chell and Reissinger edged
W&M’s Henderson and Short.
The U.S. Naval Academy finish-
ed a close third, followed by Old
Dominion and the Madison ‘‘A”’
team. Mitchell was named the
tournament’s top speaker.

The W&L debate team has a
full schedule facing them in the
next month. Professor Ryan
and the team have events plan-
ned at Johns Hopkins Universi-
ty in Baltimore during the latter
part of the month as well as
dates with Wake Forest,
Madison, William and Mary,
and Pennsylvania. Also
scheduled is a debate with Ox-
ford University at Moots Hall in
the W&L Law School. The topic
will concern the use of cen-
sorship in order to control por-
nography.

Washington and Lee Debates

Long live the King

by Ned McDonnell

Edinburgh University of
Scotland has a_ widespread
reputation for producing fine
debaters. Last Monday, Tony
Fekete and Chris Wyke,
representing this British in-
stitution, upheld that the United
States needs a monarchy.
Valiantly arguing the case for
the status-quo were Steve
Bigler and Joe Baker of
Washington and Lee. Although
the W&L duo had an extensive
arsenal of facts and figures,
they met their demise through a
difference in speaking styles.

Capitalizing on experience of
debating this topic and on dif-
ferent types of humor, the
British pair somehow managed
to put everybody, including the
audience, on the defensive.
Baker, on the other hand,
debating publicly for the first
time, showed his nervousness
thus negating some strong
arguments. By cracking one
liners on everything from
Roman Polanski to Air Force
One, by judiciously exercising
sarcasm in reference to their
opponents, by unleashing their
mordent wits on the W&L
arguments, by deftly using
“show and tell’’ techniques
such as_ presenting Silver
Jubilee T-shirts to their adver-
saries, and by using countless
other facial and verbal expres-
sions to generally win the
hearts of the audience, Fekete
and Wyke, dealing with an
untenable thesis, managed
brilliantly to divert the
onlookers’ attention from the

‘debate topic and, more im-

portantly, from the slew anti-
monarchy empiricisms
presented by Baker and Bigler.
Interspersed among the jokes,
Fekete and Eyke sustained an
argument that America needs a
monarch to unify the people and

to give people faith in their in-
stitutions through psychological
indentification with a
depoliticized cultural symbol.

Baker and Bigler countered
by saying, among other things,
that America has a _ strong
historical aversion to a
monarch, that the U.S. is too
diverse to accept a monarch
gracefully, and that a new
monarchy would bring no func-
tional or psychological ad-
vantages while imposing fiscal
strains on the federal govern-
ment.

But the yanks, gaining self
assurance toward the end of the
evening and just beginning to
pick up some of the polish of
their rivals, could not handle
the redcoats’ final ploy. Bri-
tain’s finest hour came, when,
unable to answer to Bigler’s
final arguments, Chris Wyke
frankly told the audieunce that
they were being ‘‘duped’’ by
their compatriots. This crafty
maneuver put the audience on
the intellectual defensive. If the
spectator voted with the anti-
monarchists, that person would
be among the masses of the
gullible.

Thirty votes were tallied.
FINAL SCORE: Edinburgh 20,
Washington and Lee 10. Fekete
and Wyke proved that debating,
as an art of persuasion, involves
not only facts and figures but
charisma, humour, and elo-
quence.

On the lighter side, after all
the haranguing and knit-picking
had ended, the two Britons,
(who have above average im-
itations of “Big Jimmy’’),
relaxed over beers in the
Cockpit and admitted that as
members of the Conservative
Union, they sat in back rooms,
got drunk, and sang Con-
federate fight songs. The two
elaborated further on the sub-
ject by noting that an occa-
sional visiting American
Republican, enamored with the
idea of a U.S. nobility, would aid
and abet them in their “‘rebel”
effort. Wyke and Fekete travel
on to Princeton where they have
promised to wave the Con-
federate flag in lieu of the Union
Jack.
