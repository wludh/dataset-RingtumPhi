EC asks for more money,

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, OCTOBER 13, 1977

Ariel suffers cutbacks

by Lee Howard

Because of the very tight
budget situation this year, the
Executive Committee voted 7-3
Monday night to request that
the Board of Trustees raise the
student activity fee by $5 per
term next year.

‘Very few organizations were
satisfied with the final budget
allotments decided on by the
Executive Committee Monday,
but all could be thankful for at
least one thing; the long, gruel-
ing sessions are finally over.

After sessions of 12, 34% and
114 hours three weeks in succes-
sion, Ariel, the student literary
magazine, was probably the
most dissatisfied organization.
After requesting a budget of
$1,200, Ariel’s editor Parker
Potter saw his request cut first
to $950 and then to $500. This
will mean that, instead of being
assured of having enough
money for two issues, the Ariel
will have to come back to the
E.C. and ask for extra money if
it finds itself in the position of
being able to put out another
one, E. C. preident Jim
Underhill said.

Underhill and several other
E.C. members were not op-
timistic that the Ariel could put
out two issues. The based their
opinions on the fact that Ariel

has only been able to put out one
issue per year for the last two
years. Potter, however, insisted
that he could put out two issues,
but said he needed to plan on the
E.C. money.

Mike Missal, senior E.C.
representative, was the most
vocal supporter of Ariel, saying
that Ariel needed a guaranteed
amount of money much more
than Contact, the organization
which was to gain the money
Ariel lost. He said that the Inter
Fraternity Council may be able
to give Contact more money
than it gave last year. Steve
Jones, IFC secretary, confirm-
ed that the organization would
probably be able to give Contact
more money but said he wasn’t
sure how much more it
would be able to give. He said
he couldn’t assure the E.C. it
would be as much as $450.

Jack Bovay, junior E.C.
representative, made the mo-
tion to take $450 away from
Ariel and give it to Contact. The
motion passed 7-3. Missal, E.C.
secretary Neil Pentifallo, and
vice president George Criffin
were the dissenters.

Another organization which
was dissatisfied with its final
budget was the Student Ac-
tivities Board. Although no ad-
ditional money was taken from
the SAB at Monday’s meeting,

Henry Howell, democratic
candidate for governor, visited
Lexington Friday in an effort,
as he said in a press conference
later, to go ‘‘to the people to
stop the untruths spread about
Henry Howell.”’

Howell, speaking at a press
conference in Washington and
Lee’s Fairfax Lounge, was the
victim of a letter sent by Rep. J.
Kenneth Robinson, R-Va.,
which inaccurately stated
Iseveral of Howell’s stands.
Howell said that his enemies did
this in an effort to ‘‘attach fears
in people’s minds to the can-
didate they want to defeat.’’
When asked whether he thought
republican gubernatiorial can-
didate John N. Dalton was
responsible for the mailings, he
said Dalton and Robinson are
‘good republican  friends.’’
Howell added, ‘‘The mail is to

idefeat me and elect him,”’

 

Howell Charges
Smear Tactics

Howell called the mail cam-
paign ‘“‘The most costly direct
mail campaign in the history of
Virginia.’’ He added, “‘I do not
have the money to fight direct
mail.” It is the most expensive
and effective way of garnering
votes,” he said.

On the issue of Dalton’s
“feathering his nest’? by in-
troducing banking legislation,
which favored a bank in Rad-
ford in which Dalton has
$265,000 worth of shares; all
Howell would say was
‘‘Bankers shouldn’t put in bank-
ing legislation.’’ He said he
believes this is a conflict of in-
terest.

Howell also attacked the “I
per cent who control a large
amount of economic factors.”’
He particularly criticized those
who own interests in utility
companies, saying that the fuel
adjustment clause subsidizes
mismanagement by the
utilities. In every other com-

Police raid fraternities

by Randy Smith

Two Washington and Lee
frateenity presidents were
taken to Lexington police head-
quarters by city police late
Saturday night, and issued writ-
ten summonses for violation of
the city’s noise ordinance.

Lexington police visited
Sigma Phi Epsilon and Phi
Gamma Delta fraternities, both
on Preston Street, in response
to neighbor complaints about
excessively loud music
emanating from bands the
fraternity houses had hired for
Homecoming weekend. Subse-
quent to the police visits, bet-
ween 11 p.m. and midnight,
both fraternity presidents were
issued summonses to appear in
court on October 18 for violation
of a city ordinance (15-32, Sec-
tion B) which forbids noise
more than 50 feet from its point
of origin between the hours of 11
p.m. and 7 a.m. Violation of the
ordinance can carry a penalty
of up to $1,000 and/or one year
in jail.

Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby, in an interview Mon-
day, reiterated that ‘‘we’ve
been going to the fraternities,
asking them to turn the noise
down,”’ but with little apparent

With the Blueridge coun-
tryside swooning in the brisk In-
dian Summer breeze, eighteen

ing Queen, faced a hectic Fri-
day afternoon of introductions,
interrogations, and dining in
their hot pursuit of the highest

sity to any young lady. First,

success. In Chief Kirby’s eyes,
the police department has done
“everything possible” to main-
tain good relations with the
students, “‘but when the (City)
Council passes an ordinance, it
is our duty to see it’s enforced.”’

Chief Kirby refused this
reporter’s request for the
names of the fraternity
presidents issued the sum-
monses, citing the “Privacy
Security Act.’’ He did, however,
give the approximate location
of the fraternity houses by
disclosing the streets where the
noise complaints originated,
and some Post Office box
numbers. (Section 261.23h of the
Postal Service Manual forbids
the disclosure of a boxholder’s
name, address, and telephone
number by Postal workers “‘ex-
cept for law enforcement pur-
poses”’ or “‘in response to a sub-
poena or court order.’’)

The presidents of the only two
fraternities on Preston Street,
one of the streets cited by Chief
Kirby, readily admitted that
they had been issued sum-
monses Saturday night, and
agreed to interviews with the
Ring-tum Phi.

Phi Gamma Delta president,
Charlie Brown, related that
Lexington police came by the

their escorts, had cocktails and
met the selection committee of
Carolle Chappel, Mrs. Miller,
and professors Schillington,
Dobbs, and Stevenson.

The girls, just beginning to
gear up for the imminent for-
mality, combined, in some
cases, the social grace in-
dicative of refined young ladies
with the candid humour of pre-
sent day coeds. One Sweet Briar
lass, using the eloquence of a

Fiji house shortly after 11:00
p.m. and gave him a warning
that the music was too loud. ‘‘So
I went ahead and asked the
band to turn down their music,
which they did. Then, at ap-
proximately 11:45 p.m., a se-
cond officer arrived and told me
the music was too loud and I
was going to get a summons.”
He was taken down to police
headquarters and issued a writ-
ten summons to appear in court
for violation of ordinance 15-32,
Section B.

While down at the sta-
tionhouse, Brown was told that
if the officers had to return to
Fiji, the band’s equipment
would be confiscated and he
would be put in jail for the
night. Mindful of the threatened
consequences, the band ceased
playing for the evening.

Just prior the action against
Fiji, Lexington police had taken
Mark Danos, president of
Sigma Phi Epsilon, down to
headquarters for his summons
to court. According to Danos’
account, he had not been warn-
ed about SPE’s band being too:
loud before he received his sum-
mons. ‘“‘We were warned about
excessive noise once before
Saturday night, and that was a

pseudo-top-drawer accent,
snapped in a fit of apparent sar-
casm, ‘I don’t know how much
longer I can put up with this lit-
tle girl stuff,’ while a future
princess admitted openly that
she was extremely nervous.

After the introductory
cocktails, each contestant spent
15 minutes answering in
privacy, the general questions
of the five judges. When the last
nominee had answered the final
question, the whole group,
escorts, competitors, and
judges went out to dinner at the
treat of the college. .This dinner
table situation gave the selec-
tion committee one last op-
portunity to examine and select
the Queen and her two
princesses whom they. would
present to the next day
homecoming halftime crowd of
admiring undergrads and
nostalgic alumni.

On the fateful morning, amid
the frenetic last minute
preparations of the contestants,
torential downpours saturated
Lexington. At halftime, as the
rain begain to wane, with eigh-

teen delicately set hairdoos and
the football game given up for
lost, the faithful homecoming

verbal warning on September
30th.”’

When Danos returned from
police headquarters, the SPE
party was back into “‘full sw-
ing.’’ But the Lexington police
returned at 12:45 and told
Danos, as they told Brown, that
the band’s equipment would be
confiscated unless they stopped
playing immediately. Ap-
parently even the absence of a
band did not stop the party at
SPE, which repartedly con-
tinued until “‘the early hours of
the morning.”’

When asked for his reactio-
nand thoughts on the future im-
plications of Saturday night’s
police action, Fiji president
Charlie Brown said that he
hopes some sort of compromise
can be worked out with City of-
ficials ‘because fraternities
can’t function without partying
on Friday and Saturday
nights—especially on
Homecoming weekend. I can
understand complaints occurr-
ing during the week, but an
11:00 p.m. curfew on Friday
and Saturday is just too restric-
ting.”’

“However, ‘‘ Brown added,
“if nothing can be worked out,
then I can foresee many pro-
blems arising. To limit Friday
and Saturday night activities at
fraternities would be disastrous
for W&L.”’

Mark Danos sees a direct con-
flict between the noise or-
dinance and fraternity parties.
‘It is ridiculous to think that the
police can end a party at 11:00
p.m. The decision to all of a sud-
den enforce this ordinance after
SO Many years is puzzling, to
say the least. Did the police
honestly believe our house
(SPE) had any reason to think
that a band party, which has
been acceptable in past years,
would result in the summonzing
of the president?”

Danos believes Washington
and Lee officials should meet
with the City Council ‘‘and
straighten this ordinance mess
up. The fraternities are suffer-
ing for the sudden whim to en-
force this ordinance. Something
must be done, and it must come
trom President Huntley and the
University administration.”’

On the same night, Phi Kappa
Psi was given a warning about
the loudness of their band’s
music, but no summons was
issued. According to fraternity
members, a policeman heard
their party from the police
parking lot across the street,
and issued the warning on that
basis. The turned down the
musi¢e and received no further
visits.

Developments Since Monday

When Interfraternity Council
president Steve Mattesky heard
about’ the summonzing of
Brown and Danos, he was
understandably disturbed about
the incident. He immediately
gathered the pertinent facts and
met with University ad-
ministrators to consider
various plans of actions. A
meeting was arranged between
City and University officials for
Tuesday afternoon to discuss
the noise problem.

Prior to Tuesday’s meeting,
Dean of Students Lewis G.
John, was hopeful that ‘some
sort of understanding or agree-
ment”’ could be reached with Ci-
ty officials so that future com-
plaints of excessive noise com-
ing from fraternities could be
handled “through University
channels.”’ Dean John pointed

out that ‘‘constant noise
throughout the week’’ had made
Lexington residents ‘‘less

tolerant on the weekends,” and
that the police were merely
responding to registered com-
plaints. He hoped a compromise
between the IFC request (of
1:00 a.m. cut-off time) and the
City ordinance (11:00 p.m.)
could be reached. ‘‘The way the
ordinance is enforced is just as
important as what’s on the
books.”’

But all hope for a compromise
was seemingly lost by Tuesday
evening. At the IFC meeting
that night, Steve Mattesky
outlined the results of that
afternoon’s meeting between
Police Chief Lirby, Lexinton
Mayor Phelps, City Manager
Doan, Dean Murphy, Dean
John, and the IFC president.
Out of that afternoon meeting
came the word that the or-
dinance would be _ enforced

strictly, and that town senti-
ment, apparently, strongly sup-
ports its enforcement.

A listing of 25 citizen com-,

plaints about excessive frater-
nity noise, filed at police head-
quarters, was given to Mat-
tesky. Complaints were receiv-
ed at varying hours of the day,
and for every day of the week.
Mattesky was warned that the
citizens of Lexington would no
longer be tolerant of fraternity
abuses. ‘“‘The University, for
the time being, is not in a
negotiating position with the Ci-
ty’s administration.”

Because of this apparent
animosity between the frater-
nities and the town’s people,
Mattesky emphasized that the
fraternities would have to
‘“‘prove themselves responsi-
ble,’ and show their ‘good
faith”’ to the city. As a means of
reinforcing the image of respon-
sibility, the IFC president warn-
ed that fraternities reported
making noise after the city’s
prescribed time limit would be
subject to possible social proba-
tion as well as legal actions
taken by city officials ‘‘to pro-
tect’’ those fraternities not
usually in conflict with city or-
dinances.

Chi Psi a “Gentleman’s Fraternity”

by Galen Trussell

Chi Psi, the newest of
Washington and Lee’s fraternal
orders, will have a house for its
sophomores to live in by next
year.

Peter Keefe, President of the
Chi Psis, said that the fraternity
will either buy or build a house
so its members will have a
structure to live in during the
1978-79 school year.

Sources around campus
claim that the budding fraterni-
ty has received a $250,000 grant
from the national. Keefe refus-
ed to be tied down to a specific
figure, but said resources were
available to start looking for a
house immediately.

The Chi Psi national was first
contacted about establishing a
chapter at Washington and Lee
by Dean Lewis John. After
discerning there was enough
alumni support in this area to
warrant a chapter at
Washington and Lee, the na-
tional went ahead with plans.
The first members of Chi Psi at
Washington and Lee were in-
itiated into the national in
February, and the fraternity
was officially recognized by the
IFC last spring.

Keefe acknowledged not hav-
ing a house to rush out of was a
definite handicap during rush.
He said Chi Psi held its first and
second rush dates at the Alex-
ander Withrow House. During
the second rush date, however,
the Chi Psis were told to leave
because they were making too
much moise. Consequently, the
rest of the fraternity’s rush
dates had to be held in a
member’s apartment on Ran-
dolph Street.

Keefe felt the eviction didn’t
really hurt the Chi Psi rush
because the frat got six pledges
while giving only eight bids.
Overall, the frat will have 11 ac-
tive members next fall.

In the Cockpit:

 

As for finding a house, Keefe
admitted the going has not been
all smooth. The frat’s first
choice was Belfield House,
vacated after Deal Gillam’s
death. However, Chi Psi could
not get the house because of
zoning restrictions. A house on
Jackson Street was the fraterni-
ty’s second choice, but the
house was sold before the na-
tional president could come to
Lexington and inspect it. Keefe
said he has_ several local
realtors looking for a structure,
but as of now there are no
strong possibilities.

Nationally, Chi Psi fancies
itself a gentleman’s fraternity,
according to Keefe. Keefe add-
ed the national places strong
importance on elegant houses
and strong academics. The na-

tional even goes so far as to re-
quire each chapter to have a
special study room which com-
plies with national specifica-
tions. According to Keefe, Chi
Psi has the largest scholarship
funds of any national fraternity,
offering outstanding members
internship and advanced educa-
tional opportunities.

As for the future plans of
W&L’s Chi Psi chapter, Keefe
said the house would like to
maintain a full social calendar.
Keefe also stressed his desire to
see the chapter involve itself in
community service.

Keefe, above all, wished to
stress his thanks to the KA’s
and the national for the help and
encouragement they have given
to the W&L Chi Psis.

Frosh politicians
prepare for elections

by Kevin Dwyer

Nineteen freshmen have filed
petitions for class office and Ex-
ecutive Committee represen-
tative. Eight are vying for the
position of E.C. freshman rep. :
Chip Hughes, Tom Bartlett,
Steve Swallow, Chris Gammon,
Joe Sloboda, Jeff Christovich,
Robert Brooke and Mike J. Far-
rand.

Several issues appear certain
to surface in this particular
race. Many freshmen are con-
cerned about the honor system
and its attendants-including in-
dependent exams. Some feel
that there is too much im-
portance placed on the viola-
tions. Jeff Christovich, one of
the candidates for E.C. feels
that ‘‘too many freshmen have
too little respect for the E.C.
because it continually em-
phasizes the negative-honor
violations, and neglects the
positive-projects for students.”’

At its Monday meeting, the
current Executive Committee
set several limits on the ongoing
campaigns. The initial require-
ment was that each potential

Fat Meat Boys
bring “Road” here

by Dan Scott

The management of the
Cockpit in its ongoing effort to
‘bring the road”’ to Washington
and Lee, has booked ‘Ace
Weems and the Fat Meat Boys”
to play this Saturday, Oct. 15 at
8:00. When asked to define ex-
actly what “bringing the road”’
to W&L means, Cockpit night
manager Dan Scott replied,
‘Who the hell wants to drive 50
miles in his search for female
companionshipWouldn’t it be
great to walk across the street
to the University Center and
find what you are looking for on
a Friday or Saturday night
lounging around the Cockpit?
Also, when a girl comes to W&L

on a weekend night, or any,

night for that matter, just

where can she go in Lexington
knowing she’s going to meet
people and be entertained? We
want the Cockpit to become a
center of contact for the student
body and for the surrounding
girl’s schools. We want it to be a
place where every student on
campus will know he can come
in and have a good time—just
about every night of the week.
That’s why we are determined
to get good entertainment in
here every Wednesday, Friday,
and Saturday at least.”

When asked about this Satur-
day’s entertainment, Scott said,
‘**Ace Weems and the Fat Meat
Boys’ kick. The guys in the
group just have a real good time
performing. It rubs off on
everyone in the audience.”

candidate obtain 50 signatures
from members of his class.
Campaign spending has been
limited to $7.50, and each can-
didate is limited to one banner
and 20 campaign posters. ©

The Presidency of the
freshman class is open also, and
eight have entered this race as
well: J. Scott Cardozo, Jamie
Small, Raymond Best, Dutch
Waldbauer, Marc Firestone,
John Schmidt, Peter Eliades
and Sam Campbell. The
primary responsibility of the
class president is to represent
the class on the Student Control
Committee. He also organizes
the class parties.

One candidate, Marc
Firestone, may have gotten a
jump on the others by throwing
an “‘imported-beer”’ party in his
room Homecoming night.
Firestone believes in freshman
self-discipline and in taking a
firm stand against honor viola-
tions.

The interest in the office of
vice president is somewhat
less; there are three can-
didates: Robert Neely, Joe
Robles and Bob H. Willis. Says
Willis, ‘‘I think class solidarity
is essential, and I honestly feel
that I can and will work hard to
pull this class together, so that
despite necessary diversity, we
feel united.”’

The other candidates could
not be reached for their com-
ments.

Posters and banners have
begun appearing throughout the
Quad and in the lawn area in
front of Davis and Gilliam. The
election will be Monday, Oct. 17.

Howell Visits W&L

(continued from page 1)

pany stockholders are responsi-
ble for mismanagement, but not
in the utilities, he said. When
asked why broker firms such as
Merrill-Lynch believe that
Virginia utilities are a bad in-
vestment because of the high
risk relative to the rate of
return, Howell said he believes
there is no risk and that a 12 per
cent rate of return is ‘‘more
than adequate”’ despite the fair
return being listed at ‘“‘between
13 and 14 per cent.”’

Howell said he would try to
prevent another gasoline shor-
tage, such as the one which hit
Virginia last year, by having a
“‘tie-in”’ for energy predictions.
He said he would make sure
beforehand that he knew where
supplies could be found in the
event of a shortage. He said that
if, for some reason, he was
unable to predict the shortage,
he would expect to have “‘ins-
tant contact” with the utilities
to resolve the situation.

Howell, when asked to com-
ment on Dalton’s statement
that the would turn Virginia into
the “energy capitol of the
world,’ said that was a ‘‘cam-
paign dream.” He said Virginia
could not hope to compete with
Texas in the number of oil wells
and that Virginia would not
want to give up on one of its
most important industries,
tourism. He said that the state

has tough environmental stan-
dards, with good cause. He said
in an attempt to industrialize,
States often lose their natural
industries. He cited the exam-
ple of the James River, which
became so polluted with kepone
that it wiped out fishing in that
area. He called this ‘‘one of the
great industrial tragedies in the
history of the United States.”

Howell said Dalton has shown
‘no consumer interest.’ He
said Dalton favors both the
automatic fuel adjustment
clause and deregulating the
price of gasoline. Both would
send the price of energy out of
sight, he said.

Howell excused himself after
the short 20 minute press con-
ference, saying he must move
on; there was a lot more cam-
paigning to do. He took time out
to shake the hand of professor
Milton Colvin, who had been his

Washington and Lee’s Cross
Country team traveled to Lyn-
chburg Saturday, falling to Lyn-
chburg while soundly defeating
Norfolk State. Virginia
Wesleyan was to be the fourth
opponent in a_ schelduled
quadrangular meet but failed to
show thereby forfeiting to the
Generals.

Lynchburg College won the
meet with a score of 25 points.
The Hornets were paced by
Dave Taylor, who finished first
with a time of 27 minutes 20
seconds. Washington and Lee
was a close second to Lyn-
chburg with a point total of 32.
Richard Bird finished third
overall and first for the
Generals with a time of 27
minutes and 54 seconds. The
fourth place man in the meet
was Bob Bates with a time of 27

Generals Sparkle In Water

Polo Home Opener

Lexington got a chance to see
intercollegiate water polo for
the first time last weekend as
W&L hosted a Southern League
Tournament in the Cy Twombly
Pool. And if the results are any
indication, they should host a
few more in the very near
future. The Generals defeated
VMI 17-9 in game one, lost a
heart-breaker to Georgia
Southern 18-17 in their second
game, but came back to beat
East Carolina 1-0, and James
Madison 15-6 making their won-
loss record 7-3.

Scott Duff led W&L against
VMI with six goals, while co-
captains Biff Martin and Keith
Romich had five and four goals

Undefeated In ODAC

The Generals maintained
their unbeaten record in the
ODAC last Wednesday by
defeating Roanoke College 2-1.
On the road last Saturday the
Generals lost to Division III na-
tionally ranked Eliza
Elizabethtown College 5-1.

The Roanoke game upped the
Generals’ conference record to
2-0, making Saturday’s game at
Lynchburg a key contest as far
as the 1977 ODAC title is con-
cerned. Overall, the Generals
are 5-2 with nine games remain-
ing, seven of those contests be-
ing against NCAA Division I
teams.

The Roanoke Maroons,
revitalized this fall under new
coach Mike Doran, jumped out
to an early 1-0 lead with seven
minutes gone in the first half.
Ten minutes later, junior right
wing Howie Collier recorded his
first goal of the season ona nifty
pass from Junior Bill Stone
making a 1-1 halftime score.
With ten minutes gone in the
final half, Collier was awarded
a penalty kick, converted, mak-
ing it a 2-1 count in favor of
W&L. Freshman goalie Kevin
Carney shut out the Maroons
the rest of the way giving W&L
their fifth win, of the campaign.

Senior Mark Bennett played the
first half in goal.

National Div. III power
Elizabethtown led the Generals
only 1-0 at half, but exploded for
four second half goals, two of
them coming on penalty kicks,

to come away with a 5-1 victory.
Coach Rolf Piranian is quick to
point out that his team did not
collapse in the second half. ‘‘No
sooner did we score a goal,”’
said Piranian, ‘‘then we were

Lacrosse Undergrads
Lose Exhibition Match

For the second time in three
tries, the W&L alumni lacrosse
players defeated the varsity,
this time by a 9-6 score on mud-
dy Wilson Field last Sunday.
The alumni also won 17-12 in
1976, with the varsity winning
7-4 in 1975.

A crowd of about 2000 watch-
ed as Don Carroll (’76), the
leading point scorer in W&L
lacrosse history scored two
goals and had two assists in
leading the alumni. Biff Martin
(’77) had a goal and an assist,
while singletons were recorded
by Dave Warfield (75), Rob
Morgan (’76), Doug Fuge (’77),
Jack Dudley ('77),, John, Lalley.

(°74), and Key Miller (75).

Sophomore attackman Bill
Mahon led the varsity with two
goals, while John Black, Jeff
Fritz, Roman Kaupecky, and
Jay Foster also scored. It was a
nip and tuck affair throughout,
tied 3-3 after one quarter. 5-5 at
half, and the alumni leading 7-6
after three.

The 1977 Generals completed
their regular season at 11-3 and
ranked fifth nationally in the
University Division. They lost
to Maryland in the quarter-
finals of the NCAA tournament.
The team opens the 1978 season
on March 4th at Duke.

 

Southern loss Martin had seven
goals with Romich notching six
tallies. After trailing early,
W&L led most of the final three
quarters by one or two goals,
before number one seed Ga.
Southern tied the game at 17

with thirty seconds to play.
Another quick goal put the
Generals down 18-17 with 0:13
seconds to play. When asked
how his team managed to give
up two goals in the final 30
seconds of the match, Coach
Stearns replied, ‘‘Inexperience.
We’ve made remarkable pro-
gress over the past few weeks,
but the mental errors are still
killing us.”’

Romich, the team’s leading
goal scorer, hit the net seven

times against Southern giving
him 17 goals in three games.
The win over ECU came by
forfeit. The crowd for the tour-
nament games was an en-
couraging one, with anticipa-
tion running high for the
Generals’ next home action on
October 28-29 for the Virginia
State Championships.

This weekend’s upcoming
matches will probably be the
most important all season for
the Generals. They face the

powerhouses of the league, in-
cluding unbeaten Slippery Rock
State. The crucial game could
be against Penn. State at their
home pool this Friday night.

Drops 5th Straight

by Pete Abitante

Three touchdowns within 82
seconds in the first quarter was
all Maryville needed in coasting
to a 42-0 victory over the
Generals at homecoming. Play-
ing in a constant rain which
made field conditions
treacherous, the Generals were
unable to get untracked chalk-
ing up only 8 first downs. In ad-
dition, they managed only 120
yards in the air and an increadi-
ble minus 16 yards rushing.

Maryville took their first
possession of the game and
drove 62 yards in 11 plays with
Keith Goodwin crasing in from
one yard out, providing all that
was needed for the Scots.

As in the past four games, tur-
novers cost W&L this one.
Maryville transformed four of
nine W&L miscues (6 intercep-
tions and 3 fumbles) into 28
points.

Safety Steve Savage in-
tercepted a Scott Swope pass on
W&L’s second. psssession,
returning it 15 yards to the
Generals’ 18 thus setting up a
Charlie Hixon to Goodwin

touchdown pass. The kick by
Tim Kelly gave the Scots a 14
point lead. Savage intercepted
another Swope pass on the ensu-

ing passession returning it 38
yards for a touchdown.

On the first play of the second
quarter, Ted Hissey, replacing
Swope, was intercepted by Mike
Thomas which led to another
opposition score. Seventy-six
yards and 10 plays later, Hixon
hit Dan Colely with a 15 yard
pass to make it 28-0 at halftime.

The halftime festivities,
organized by senior Ed Wick,
proved to be the highlight of the
game when Julie Osborne
representing Sigma Nu, was
awarded the ‘‘Shillington
Pucker of the year’’ and title of
homecoming queen.

A Hissey fumble on the
Generals 10 yard line led to the
only score of the third period—
an 11 yard run by Marksberry.
Freshman quarterback Jeff
Raby capped the scoring for the
day hitting Clayton Crosby with
an 11 yard pass in the fourth
quarter to cap the most disap-
pointing day of the season for
Washington and Lee.

A bright spot, if there is such
a thing in this game, was
flanker Rich Wiles who with
four receptions, upped his con-
ference lead to 21. Don

W&L Ruggers “Beaten” by Veemees

by Kevin Dwyer

Under the leadership of a new
coach, Constantine Roussos of
the Math Department, the W&L
Rugby Club met VMI in its first
contest last Thursday afternoon
on the VMI parade ground. In
what turned out to be an uneven
matchup, VMI’s squad bested
W&L 38-4. VMI’s team is more
organized and better trained
than the W&L club. Club
Treasurer Rob Lee said,
“Naturally, we’re disappointed
that we didn’t win, but we area
much stronger team this year,
and things are looking good.”

Several VMI goals were
disallowed during the game,
and one ‘‘veemee”’ was expelled
from the game for unnecessary
roughness. This particular
player is known to W&L Rugby
fans as simply ‘Big Daddy.”
He was VMI’s leading scorer
until his ejection for deliberate-

ly punching a W&L man after
the ball was dead. The referee
was a member of VMI’s squad,
but despite this, ‘‘Big Daddy’”’
hit him in the face with the ball
in disgust following his expul-
sion. He went off the field to a

chorus of blood-curdling hur-

rahs from his teammates.

The topic of the day was the
roughness of the ‘‘veemees.”’
Several W&L men were heard
complaining about the illegal
shoves and hits after a ball was
ruled dead, and about un-

necessary brutality on the part
of more than a few of VMI’s
team members. Club President
Bev Mauck was especially
puzzled, since this game was
technically only a scrimmage
and because there was no of-
ficial referee present. Said
Mauck, “We just don’t unders-
tand why they were hitting so
hard.”’ One W&L man had to be
hospitalized for what were ap-
parently internal injuries.
W&L’s Bob Connally scored

Alumnus Makes
It Big In NFL

by Pete Abitante

While many National Foot-
ball League teams make
numerous changes in their
player personnel framework
during the off season, few alter
their front office structure.
However, there are exceptions
to every rule and the American
Conference New York Jets pro-
ve the exception to this one.

After two consecutive 3-11
seasons, the worst in the team’s
seventeen year history, Jet
owner Leon Hess, with vivid
memories of the 1969 Super
Bowl championship still linger-
ing, decided it was high time to
get back on the winning track.

In order to insure a smooth
turnabout in the front office,
Hess hired Jim Kensil as presi-
dent and chief operating officer.
Kensil had worked in the league
office for sixteen years, the last
nine of which were served as ex-
ecutive director, or in the words
of commissioner Pete Rozelle,
“my offensive and defensive
coordinator.”’

To turn things around on the
playing field, the Jets chose
W&L’s own Walt Michaels to
become the eighth head coach
in their history and W&L’s first
representative in the profes-
sional coaching ranks.

Playing fullback, linebacker,
and guard, Michaels earned a
B.A. in psychology, graduating
in 1951. As a player and person
he was unsurpassed at W&L,
leading the Generals to the
Gator Bowl in 1950.

Drafted by the Cleveland
Browns in the seventh round,
Walt was traded to the Green
Bay Packers but was reac-

pleasure.

quired by the Browns in 1952.
He went on to become an
outstanding linebacker as
evidenced by his All-Pro status
from 1957-60.

Retiring after the 1961 season,
Michaels joined the Oakland
Raiders coaching staff as defen-
sive line coach for a year before
coming to the Jets in a similar
position in 1963.

For ten years Michaels
masterminded the growth of the
New Yorkers’ defense,
culminating in the 1969 Super
Bowl when his ‘‘troops’’ held
the Colts scoreless until four
minutes were left in the game.

After three years (1973-75) as
defensive coordinator with the
Philadelphia Eagles, Michaels
returned to New York. His pro-
motion to head coach last year
was more of an election than a
selection and it is not hard to
see why—the Jets are off to
their best start since 1972.

While losing the first two
games of the season the Jets re-
bounded to stun the New
England Patriots 30-27 at Shea
Stadium. This past week they
defeated the Buffalo Bills 24-19
to even their season record at
two and two. In both games
Michaels’ presence has been
evident as the Jets have won
their games on good defense.

With Miami, Oakland, and
New England on three con-
secutive weekends, the defense
has its work cut out for it. But
with Walt Michaels at the helm,
you can bet the Jets will be
mentally and_ physically
prepared to enter a new era in
their history as well as a new
era for W&L. Good Luck Walt.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Students harassed

As it should be common knowledge by now, the city
of Lexington depends on the W&L community for so
much. Jobs are provided for many Lexington citizens
at W&L, which keeps the unemployment rate down.
W&L, being a tourist attraction, draws crowds of peo-
ple to the city every year and along with them their
money. But the most important contribution by W&L
to the Lexington community is asa source of
revenues for the city in the forms of parking and traf-
fic fines; fines for ridiculous, vague and outdated or-
dinances; and now potential fines for just being
ourselves and partying a bit too much.

It seems to us, that in this quiet, peaceful town
where crime seems to be nonexistent, except for irate
Lex high football fans after a loss on Friday night, the
police have nothing better to do than to harass our
fraternities for trying to escape a little from the
tedium of week-long intense studying. Granted,
sometimes the partying can become a little too in-
tense and get out of hand, but we have serious doubts
whether a little wild partying warrants a threat of the
maximum penalty of $1,000 and a year in prison from
the town’s police chief.

Also, it seems odd to us that even though ordinances
15-31 and 15-32 have been on the books for years, the
police force has just now decided to enforce them. The
frat houses have been around for years, and have
been assumedly partying at the same intensity level
year after year. The residents of the neighborhoods in
which the fraternities are situated presumedly are
accustomed to frat parties, so why all of a sudden are
they lodging complaints against them. Or are they ac-
tually lodging complaints? It seems very incredible |
to us that a sedate, quiet, and rela tively civilized
fraternity such as SPE would ever be cited for being
disorderly or irritatingly noisy.

This appears to be another arguable case of harass-
ment, just as the “‘launching of illegal missiles”’ last
year (the throwing of snowballs) was another
arguable case of harassment. Also, just as the use of
tape measures by policemen to make sure students
don’t overstep the boundaries of the law and park
their cars an inch over what is stipulated is an
arguable case of harassment. The town speed traps
are another case, but we won’t mention them here.

How much longer must our students continue to pay
the salaries.of the town’s employees? How much
longer do we have to be subjected to this harassment
by the police? How much longer will the people of
Lexington get their jollies at our expense?

Washington and Lee should not have to sit back and
watch its students be exploited like this. W&L poten-
tially has quite a bit of strong influence in the city
government. We think it is about time that this in-
fluence should be exerted. Professor of economics
Charles Phillips is the Mayor. Retired professor Leon
Sensabaugh and professor Thomas Imeson are both
members of the city council. Dean of students Lewis
John is a member of the school board. Gentlemen,
priorities must be established.

The situation has not yet gotten out of hand, but it
has the potential for doing so. The problems that exist
between the students of W&L and the citizens of Lex-
ington must be resolved now before sentiments
become bitter. As with all compromises, both sides
must be willing to give a little. Perhaps the students
should become a little more considerate; the town
definitely should become more sensible and tolerant.
Unless this compromise is reached, Lexington could
experience ‘town and gown’’ riots similar to those
that frequently occurred during medieval times.

Letters
To
Editor

Dear Editor,

It seems to us to be a very ap-
propriate time to speak out
against both the opinion ex-
pressed in your last editorial
and the general attitude of a
great many W&L students.

The belief (or even the
thought) that a ‘‘rack date’’ can
add to one’s ‘character, per-
sonality, GPA, and campus
prestige” is plainly absurd. On
the contrary, the “rack date”’
should be regarded as a
disgrace to the total character
of the student. However, it
seems that this opinion is
shared and voiced by very few
students.

We attend a school that em-
phasizes honor within the stu-
dent body, which is a credit to
this institution. It seems to be a
hypocritical paradox that
females are treated so
dishonorably and_ without
respect by so many members of
the student body. No longer are
females regarded as_in-
dividuals with feelings, but in-
stead of sexual goals that must
be conquered in order to obtain
social status.

As students who are concern-
ed about the future of W&L and
its students, we ask for a reex-
amination of each individual’’s
attitudes towards the opposite
sex. We need to look upon them
not as toys or playthings to be
discarded as soon as we are
finished with them, but as real
people with feelings.

We feel that the necessities of
life are met, not by sex, but
through the acceptence of the
love given by Jesus Christ.

Prayerfully,
Mike Brown °80

UT to open with Oedipus

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

To begin to get an understan-
ding of Sophocles’ classic
tragedy, Oedipus Rex, it is
necessary to take a look at the
civilization from which it
sprung. Athens was the home of

_ the first great democracy, and
early in the 5th century B.C.,
they astonished the world (and
themselves) by beating off the
forces of a much more
militaristic country, the Per-
sian Empire. The result of the
victory in the Persian War was
a fantastic burst of energy in
political innovation, civic con-
struction and beautification—
and the great blossoming of the
arts.

The Athenians’ invented
theatre as we know it today. Its
origins in Greece are as far as
history can trace. The greatest
victories in classic tragedy oc-
curred during the Age of
Pericles, the political leader
who steered Athens through her
greatest era, roughly 460-400
B.C. It was in this period that
Sophocles, ‘‘the most human of
Greek tragic poets,’’ made his
appearance on the literary
stage.

As one critic has put it, ‘“We
know of 8 plays in antiquity call-
ed Oedipus.... Yet, surely, there
is only one Oedipus, and this is
the masterpiece of Sophocles,
Oedipus Rex. The story of this
tragedy is among the best-
known in all literature. The
House of Cadmus, ruling house
.of Thebes, because it had in
some way offended the gods,
was doomed to catastrophe.

As time passes, it is the story
of one man, the current king,
Oedipus (played in the W&L
production by senior Warren
Mowry), who searches for the
reason for the disfavor. The plot

is centered on the unwinding of
the realization that he himself
has polluted the society by his
own actions. Oedipus, com-
pletely ignorant of what he was

doing, fulfilled the dread pro-
phecy that he would slay his
father and marry his mother.
The story closes with his per-
sonal remorse and agony, as he
blinds himself, and banishes
himself from the kingdom he
loves so dearly.

The campus production will
open Monday, October 24, and
run through Saturday, October
29. Presented in the Old Boiler

Lincoln Conspiracy Panned

The Land of Oz

by Seth Oserin

If you recall the contents of
this column last week, you
might remember the surprise
that was expressed at the fact
that Lexington was chosen as a
first-run, premier town for Sunn
Pictures’ ‘‘The Lincoln Con-
spiracy.’’ Well folks, I've seen
the picture, and now know why
Lexington was among those
lucky cities chosen to debut this
movie.

It’s bad.

The movie discloses the true
reason Lincoln was killed, and
the conspiracy developed
toward this ain. In fact, the
plan was coordinated by Lin-
coln’s own cabinet after it was
discovered that Lincoln was
planning to give the South back
the vote along with $400 million.
The cabinet feared that the ad-
dition of the South to Congress
would bring so many
Democrats into the legislature
that all their power would be

‘Tdiotic

lost. The conspiracy, OK’ed by
Stanton, was originally to have
Lincoln kidnapped. However,
an over-hateful John Wilkes
Booth decided to revenge the
South and _ assassinate the
President instead of carrying
out the planned kidnapping.

To be polite, I'll say the acting
was bad. John Anderson (as
Lincoln) appears to be doing a
good job in the beginning, but
shortly after you keep thinking
he’s going to fall asleep in the
middle of a line. Bradford
Killman plays John Wilkes
Booth, and is pretty good Occa-
sionally. The problem with his
performance is that he often
comes across as Snydly
Whiplash in a melodrama with
Polly Purebred (Lincoln, of

course, being Polly). The rest of

the acturs were just plain awful.

The man we have to thank for
all this was the director, James
Conway, who ably took an
script and made it

begin taking ticket reservations
next Monday, October 17.
Again, tickets are free for all
members of the W&L
call

community—simply

 

463-9111, ext. 371 starting next
Monday, from 10-4.

The cast for the production in-
cludes, beside Mr. Mowry: Jim
Weatherstone (Creon); David
Chester (Tiresias, the aged pro-

phet); Ellen Jervey (as
Jocasta, Oedipus’ wife and
mother); Stoney Cantler

(Messenger); Ty York (High
Priest); Jeffrey Buntrock
(Shepherd); and Rich Allen
(Chorus Leader), along with
other actors of the cast in the

moronic. Moreover, I would
probably go so far as to say he
was the cause of all the bad ac-
ting that seemed to infest the
movie. This stands to reason,
after looking at the rest of the
cleverness presented. For ex-
ample, there is one scene where
the presuers in a horse chase
are accidently blocked off by a
horse drawn cart that looks as
unexpected as tomorrow morn-
ing. It's also worthy to note that
all of the brief battle scenes
shown were probably shot in the
bathroom of a Kroger’s super-
market, with the scenes all
seeming to be out-takes from a
Carol Burnett show, along with
the narrator, who's going on
about what's happening back at
the ranch.

As far as the actual contents
of the movie? Let's just say
that upon leaving the theater, it
seemed that the whole contents
of the.movie could have been
put down on two type written

nartne *

chorus.

The show is directed by
department head in drama, Lee
Kahn. Assisting him in direc-
ting tasks and as _ stage
manager is Bradley Lewis. Set
design is by Tom Ziegler,
assisted by Hunt Brown.

In commenting on the show
Mr. Kahn had the following to
say: ‘‘My feelings about doing a
classic Greek tragedy really
revolve around a way to doit, so
a contemporary audience can
get the flavor and essence of the
Greek theatric-religious ex-
perience. For me, this was com-
posed of three parts: structure,
rhythm, and irony. them
without any of the ‘trappings’ of
what we have come to look on as
theatre.

“In other words, the playing
of the characters will be done
through language and action—
not costume and make-up. For
example, the aged Tiresias will
appear at first glance, as a
twenty-year old man. His age
will come not out of graying his
hair, but out of his language and
mannerism.

“Rhythm is the key to the
whole show. The chorus, with
their signals, boxes, and bells,
will carry the majority of this.
And the final spectacle will
come out of the lighting.
Oedipus Rex is being done in an
all-new arena style by designer
Ziegler. Lights, coming out of
the floor, will reflect on the mir-
rored ceiling of the set in
various combinations. It is a
simple, straightforward ap-
proach to the play.”’

And if Mr. Kahn’s enthusiasm
is any indication at all, this pro-
duction of Oedipus Rex is bound
to be memorable. So make
reservations for the play that
sits ‘‘as a Colossus, astride the
history of tragedy....’’

Hollins
Play
Announced

Enjoyable. Fast paced. Witty.
At times, uncommonly brutal.
That’s how director Jack Phend
describes The Effect of Gamma
Rays on Man-in-the Moon
Marigolds, the fall theatre pro-
duction at Hollins College.
Shows are tonight (Oct. 13) with
nightly productions beginning
at 8:15 p.m. through Saturday
(October 15) in the Hollins Lit-
tle Theatre.

The Effect of Gamma Rays
on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds
won critical acclaim during its
New York run and was awarded
the Pulitzer prize, the Obie
Award, and the New York
Critics Circle Award as best
American play of the 1970
season.

Phend, who is designer and
technical director at the Hollins

theatre, says that the
characters in the play are uni-
que.

“But they’re much like

ourselves, too,’ he explains.
“We see the cruelties and
sometimes the goodness in each
of them. There is at least one
line or moment that will strike a
chord and be remembered by
everyone who attends.”’

The Little Theatre box office,
362-6517, will be open weekdays,
4:30 to 7 p.m., through Friday
(October 14), and one hour
before each show. Reservations
may also be made by calling the
Office of Public Information at
Hollins, 362-6452, weekdays
from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.mm

students.

The Kresge Foundation, a
philanthropic organization in
Troy, Michigan that supports
all educational institutions,
gave Washington and Lee
University a $250,000 grant last
summer. The grant, given on
the condition that the university
can raise all of the remaining
funds itself, will be used to
cover the costs of completing
the new campus library behind
Washington Hall.

McCormick Library, the pre-
sent university library that was
built in 1908, has been faced
with numerous operating pro-
blems in recent years. Original-
ly built to serve the school’s 500
students, it is no longer capable
of meeting the challenges of
university life despite many at-
tempts at rearranging its in-
terior. After the new library is
completed in late 1978, McCor-
mick will be renovated to house
the School of Commerce,
Economics, and Politics. The
present Commerce _ School,
Newcomb Hall, will become
general classroom space.

“When McCormick Library
was built, it was built in a man-
ner where it.could not be ex-
panded,’’ said Director of
Development Farris Hotchkiss.
‘This time, however, we are
building the new library so it
can be expanded without any
problems.”’

The problems of operating
McCormick Library have caus-
ed no small amount of difficulty
to university administrators.
The library’s operating budget,

just $84,000 in 1972, soared to
$290,000 during the past
academic year. The rising ex-
penses have been necessary in
order to finance the cost of
10,000 new books a year and the
general upkeep of the rest of the
books and equipment such as
micro-film and audio-visual
machines. Rising fuel and elec-
tricity costs, of course, have ad-
ded to the numerous problems.

When completed, the new
library is expected to alleviate
many of the current problems.
Among others, the advantages
of the new building will be its
spacious interior, the addition
of more study rooms and car-
rels, and the library’s capacity
to store over 500,000 volumes.
About half of the university’s
students will be able ot study in
the new library, as compared to
just 350 students that a crowded
McCormick Library can ac-
commodate.

The new library, now about
half-finished, has been in con-
struction for the past two years.
By the time it is finished, the en-
tire project will have cost
somewhere in between $2 and $3
million. According to Hot-
chkiss, the remaining funds will
be accumulated through alumni
gifts and donations.

Hotchkiss described the new
library as being built of red
brick and styled in a manner
similar to the law school. “‘It
will fit the campus very well,”’
he continued. ‘‘The style of the
building will be such that it will
blend right in with the other
buildings on campus.”’

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has received a gift of
$50,000 from Mrs. G. Holbrook
Barber of Quoque, N. Y., to
establish an honor scholarship
endowment in memory of her
late husband, a 1917 graduate of
the university.

Income from the scholarship
endowment is to be awarded an-
nually to the undergraduate
senior who has “made the
greatest contribution to the
spirit of the campus and univer-
sity life,” taking into account
participation in university ac-

tivities, helpfulness toward
others, respect for fellow
students, character, and
scholarship.

The recipient of the G.
Holbrook Barber Scholarship
will be chosen by a panel con-
sisting of the dean of The Col-
lege, Washington and Lee’s
liberal-arts and sciences divi-
sion, and two student represen-
tatives named by the president
of the university.

After graduation from
Washington and Lee in 1917,
Holbrook Barber enetered the
College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Columbia Universi-
ty and received his M.D. degree
in 1921. He was a physician in
private practice in Brooklyn,
N.Y., until his retirement in
1951, and was medical director
of Manhattan Life Insurance
Co. for many years as well. He
died Nov. 6, 1970.

At W&L he was a classmate

of the late Harry K. (Cy)
Young, probably the most
outstanding athlete’ in

Washington and Lee’s history,
and a classmate and fraternity
brother of the late Dean Frank
J. Gilliam, dean of students and
admissions director at W&L for
more than 40 years.

Stearns says, “Right now we

the team isn’t going to go all out
against Slippery Rock, because
they have two matches against
Columbia and Villanova whom
he feels the team can beat. If
the Generals can capture two
wins on this trip they will
automatically receive a bid to

an accomplishment for a team

State, with 81 points, was of no
real consequence in the meet.

Co-captain Bill Welch said
that he thought that the
Generals would do much better
at the conference meet against
Lynchburg. The rain on Satur-
day was not much of a factor
because the course was not very
slippery. The disadvantage,
Welch maintains, was due to the
way in which the course was
laid out. He felt that a much bet-
ter performance could have
been executed by Washington
and Lee, if the Generals’ run-
ners had been familiar with the
course.

The Generals, now eight wins
and two losses for the season,
have an away meet this Friday
at Bridgewater. The opponents
will be Bridgewater College and
Roanoke College. Coach Miller
said that Roanoke would not be
a factor in the race, but that
Bridgewater could give the
Generals problems. Miller lists
Bridgewater in the same class
as Lynchburg. However, Miller
feels that if freshmen Chris
Daniels and Hans Furuland
move up in the scoring picture
that Washington and Lee should
come out on top.

called for a penalty. I think both.
calls were clearly examples of
hometown officiating.”’ As for
the other two goals, Piranian
cites a breakdown in his man-
to-man defense. Add to these
two mental errors the fact that
the Generals outshot their oppo-
nent, and one sees that the
game was not as lopsided as the
score might indicate.

Todd Tyson had the W&L
goal, his second of the season,
with the assist going to Ben
Easton, his first of the year.
Piranian called his team’s ef-
fort ‘“‘a super one, with the final
score not being indicative of the
closeness of the game.’”’ W&L
had three second half shots
labeled goal that missed by in-
ches.

Saturday on the road, the
Generals take on the Lynchburg
Hornets, defending ODAC and
VISA champions, and like W&L
currently undefeated at 2-0 in
the conference this fall.
Although early in the season,
this game will go a long way in
determining the 1977 league
champion. This is the 25th game
in the series, with the Hornets
leading 15-8-1. W&L lost 4-1 last
year, with the last W&L win
coming by a 2-1 score in 1974.
Lynchburg is 4-4 overall, losing
to Virginia 1-0 and defeating
EMC 3-2 last week.

Generals saw all afernoon early

This is shaping up to be one of
the most exciting seasons the
club has ever had, with future
contests including Lynchburg,
U. Va., and VMI again. Seven
freshmen are currently starting
and, according to President
Mauck, ‘‘There’s plenty of room
for anyone who’s interested.”
On Saturday, the club travels to
Hampden-Sydney for a match
before the football game’ in
which H-S will be playing the
Generals for their Homecom-
ing. This is a traditional rivalry
in both Rugby and Football and
a large crowd is expected.

Budget Requests
Acted Upon

its final allotment of $29,550 was
more than $4,000 less than it re-
quested. Several highly placed
sources within the SAB have
said the organization is thinking
of dispensing with Winter
Weekend or scaling it down in
order to stretch its budget.
Originally, $6,000 was alloted
for Winter Weekend in the
SAB’s budget.

Additionally, out of the SAB’s
budget must come $2,200 to pay
for live entertainment in the
Cockpit. The newly formed
Music Union will have the final
say over what entertainment
gets booked into the Cockpit’
Underhill said. Although the
M.U. will be under the wing of
the SAB, the SAB must give the
Union all of the money the E.C.
alloted for it, Underhill said. He
said the E.C. would name a new
University Center Committee
chairman who would serve as
intermediary between the SAB
and the Music Union. The chair-
man would be a voting member
of the SAB, Underhill said. He
said applications for the posi-
tion would be accepted at Mon-
day’s E.C. meeting.

Galen Trussel, a member of
the SAB and the Music Union,
expressed an interest in being
the new chairman at the past
week’s E.C. meeting. Insiders
agree that he will probably be
named U.C.C. chairman. Bill

 

Tucker, co-chairman of the

SAB, presently holds that posi-

tion.

The law school, despite
receiving $3,000 more than it got
last year, saw its proposed
budget cut by almost $1,500. A
motion by Missal to take. $400
more from the law school and
give it to the Ring-tum Phi was
voted down 7-3. Missal, Pen-
tifallo and Bovay voted for the
measure. Opponents, the most
outspoken of whom was law
representative Rick Goddard,
said they would also like to see
the Phi get back $400 tentative-
ly taken away from it last week,
but would not like to see the
money come from the law
school.

It was generally agreed by
E.C. members that they wanted
to retrieve the money they took
away from the Phi last week,
because, as George Griffin said,
the newspaper was the only
organization to cut its budget.
Phi editor Mike Gallagher
pointed out that whereas last
year’s paper payed for 65 per
cent of its cost from student
funds, this year’s paper was
asking for only 25 per cent of its
cost from student funds. This is
despite almost a 100 per cent in-
crease in cost, Gallagher said.
Griffin remarked, ‘‘I don’t think
they can doit.”

 

W&L to
debate Britons

The Washington and Lee
University debate team will
meet a specially selected team
of Britons in an exhibition
debate to be held in the Moot
Court Room of Lewis Hall Oct.
13 at 7:30 p.m.

The Washington and Lee
team will take the affirmative
side on the topic ‘Resolved:
This house prefers pornography
to censorship.”’

Halford Ryan, advisor to the
debate team, said the topic was
chosen from a list supplied by
the British team.

Ryan said that this exhibition
should show an interesting jux-
taposition of the English
debating style, characterized
by wit and style, and the
American debaters’ typical use
of evidence and reason.

The uncertainties of the legal
status of pornography and
moral problems of censorship
are two aspects that the
Washington and Lee team will
explore.

A nationwide contest took
place in England last year to
find two college students to
represent the Britons on this
tour. Philip Engleman of the
University College of London
and R. Victoria Scholfield of Ox-
ford University were chosen.
Their tour will take them to 32
universities and colleges east of
the Mississippi.

There will be no charge for

 

admission.

Oct. 19,

McPherson to speak

On next Wednesday evening,
October 19, at 8:00 p.m. in
Parmly 201, the Glasgow En-
dowment Committee will pre-
sent James A. McPherson
reading selections of his work.
Mr. McPherson, a highly prais-
ed young short story writer, is
at present writer in residence
and associate professor of
English at the University of
Virginia. Some of his work has
been gathered in two collec-
tions, Hue and Cry (1969) and
Elbow Room (1977).

Mr. McPherson was born in
Savannah, Georgia, attended
Morris Brown College in Atlan-
ta, Morgan State University in
Baltimore, went on to earn his
LL.B. from Harvard, and got an
M.F.A. at the University of
Iowa's Writers Workshop. He
won a national award for fiction
while at Morris Brown. His in-
terest in urban social problems
while in law school led to essays
in the Atlantic Monthly, for

whom he also wrote. On the
strength of these he was made a
contributing editor to the
magazine.

Subsequently his stories have
been widely published in
periodicals ranging from The
Reader's Digest to Playboy,
The Massachusetts Review and
Ploughshares, and anthologized
over the past decade in
numerous college texts as well
as in Best American Short
Stories and 0. Henry Prize
Stories. In recent years he has
taught at Iowa, Morgan State,
and the University of California
(Santa Cruz). Acclaimed for his
sensitive handling of uniquely
black American experience as
well as for his mastery of craft,
Mr. McPherson has been called
by Ralph Ellison ‘‘a writer of in-
sight, sympathy, and humor
and one of the most gifted young
Americans I’ve had_ the
privilege to read.”’

Music Union combined

with University Center

by Galen Trussell

The dilema surrounding the
control of entertainment in the
Cockpit was solved Monday,
when the E.C. voted to in-
corporate W&L’s Student
Music Union under the Univer-
sity Center Committee (UCC).

The E.C. decided to take ap-
plications for a new UCC chair-
man and committee members
at next week’s meeting. The
new UCC chairman would act
as a mediator between the UCC
and the SAB. When the UCC
decides on an act for the
Cockpit the new UCC chairman
will go to the SAB for the funds.
The UCC will still have a $2,200
budget to work with.

The Student Music Union will
serve in an advisory capacity to
the new UCC. The Union will act
primarily as a screening agent
for acts and will provide input
into the UCC about acts desired.

The SAB will have no veto
power over how the UCC elects
to use its money, except in a
case where the UCC would need
additional funds for higher
class acts.

The UCC will also be in con-
trol of movies in the Cockpit,
University Center magazine
subscriptions and the Cockpit
Christmas party. The E.C. plan-
ned that the new UCC chairman
would designate a_ separate
committee or individuals to
deal with these matters, and
utilize the Seudent Music Union
exclusively for the decisions on
musical entertainment in the
Cockpit.

The UCC was originally a
separate entity, funded entirely
by the University Center direc-
tor. When the E.C. formed the
SAB several years ago, it in-
corporated the UCC into the
SAB.

WHY IS SIGLINDA STEINFULLER
DEAN OF BEER?

Fellow Beer Persons.

 

WHY NOT?

Life is full of unanswered questions such as: Is there intelligent life
elsewhere in the universe? And if so, do they wear socks?

In beer, however, there are no unanswered questions. Because there
is only one word for beer, and you know it.

Schlitz.

Therefore, as your Dean of Beer, | suggest you research
the essential rightness of the word for yourself at your next
social function. Or even your next antisocial function.

And please note: The recommended source
material for locating the word can be found in any

phone booth. In other words, look in the Yellow

Pages. Under “Beer:
Thank you.

THERE'S JUST ONE WORD FOR BEER. >»

Well, now Rush is finally
fover. All the fraternities did
very well. The new one did ex-
ceptionally well, too. Halloween
is approaching so the E’s will
probably loose a few pledges.
Several frats were harrassed
this past week-end by the
police. Stereos at four in the
morning, really. We hear that a
certain LAX goalie and a presi-
dent of a small fraternity spent
the night in jail. Well almost;
brotherhood to the rescue. It’s a
good thing, what would they
ever have talked about.

Two Keydets were at the IFC
meeting this weekend. They
were there to ask that they be
allowed to attend all frat parties
without a written invitation.
How socially unacceptable! We
Sita heard of such a thing
since a certain secretary was
invited into the demonstration
circuit here in big LEX. Dean
Diddle (making his first ap-
pearance at an IFC meeting)
said the reason that the Keydets
want this is that there ‘‘are a lot
of Mickey Mouse rules at VMI.”
Of course, he said this after the
Keydets had left.

The second Art opening was
kicked off by another Wine and
mold party. I really think they
kept that cheese from the last
party. I felt compelled to eat
some hoping that Gordon the
terrible would give them more
money for next time, and to buy
a leash for those damn dogs.
The E.C. did their work on the
budget. Slash here slash there.
Ariel was upset because they
were the only one _ foolish
enough not to pad their budget.
Mock convention had 1,300
dollars, and when their orator
was finished the E. C. took
away $1,000. I'll tell you it was
worse than the gong show. The
law school got their fair share; I
hope they use some of the
money to foster better student
undergrad relationships. More
about the law school and the law
wives next week.

What does the red light in the
Nelson St. Apts. mean? Aw,
come on, in Lexington you've
got to be kidding.
