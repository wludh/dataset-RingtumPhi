Trusell to

chair Music

Union

by Ned McDonnell

Last Monday, the Executive
Committee held another weekly
meeting. The prospect of con-
vening the meeting remained
dubious for several moments as
straggling members streamed
into the conference room up to
ten minutes late.

The business got under way
when secretary Neil Pentifallo
informed the E.C. that the
Development Office had re-
quested ten members to sit in on
a W&L question and answer
seminar for parents on Parents’
Weekend. The seminar, dealing
with campus social life and the
Honor System, did not interest
ten volunteers so the E.C. decid-
ed to ask different class
presidents to help out.

Next on the agenda was the
matter of Student Publication
Board salaries. Citing the con-
stitution, vice president George
Griffin moved that discussion of
the controversial subject be
deferred a week. Griffin’s mo-
tion also stipulated that during
the next week the E.C. would
post signs throughout the cam-
pus announcing an open hearing
on the salary issue next Monday

night. The motion passed
unanimously.
The committee passed

another resolution unanimously
setting the date of the election
of the lone freshman University
Council member for Thursday,

FIJI fined for

homecoming noise

Charlie Brown, president of
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity,
was fined $10 in General
District Court Tuesday morn-
ing, for violation of Lexington’s
noise ordinance. Brown pleaded
guilty to a violation of city or-
dinance 15-32, Section B, which
pertains to loud noise heard out-
side after 11 p.m.

Lexington police issued
Brown the summons to appear
in court during a Fiji combo
party on Saturday, October 8th.
As president of the fraternity,
Brown was “‘responsible’’ for
any law violation made collec-
tively by members of Phi Gam-
ma Delta. In addition to the
fine, Brown had to pay $13 in
court costs.

Freedom of the press

by Neil Cote

John C. Merrill, a former
reporter and correspondent for
a number of American and
foreign newspapers and cur-
rently a journalism professor at
the University of Missouri, lec-
tured to a near-capacity crowd
in duPont Auditorium on Oc-
tober 13 on the subject ‘““From
Press Freedom to Press
Responsibility: A Good or Bad
Trend.”’

In his speech, Merrill stated
that the theory of freedom of the
press is gradually being replac-
ed by a belief that journalists
have a responsibility to the
public. Merrill said this is a
dangerous trend because it
could give birth to an
authoritarian press system in
the United States in the future.”

One of Merrill’s main points
was that, contrary to what most
people believe, a free press does
not necessarily have to play the
role of a government watchdog
or the fourth branch of the

government. If members of the
press are forced into such a
role, Merrill said, the press
would not be free. Merrill
declared that members of the
press should have the liberty to
chose whatever role they want
to fulfill, even if this meant that
some journalists would choose
to become irresponsible and in-
competent.

“Don’t get me wrong, I’m not
in favor of irresponsible jour-
nalism,’’ he stated. ‘‘I just don’t
like the idea of the press having
to follow the theory of social
responsibility. If the press is
forced to follow this theory,
then it isn’t a free press.”’

Merrill also expressed fear
that a number of forces are en-
couraging ‘ conformity in
American journalism. The for-
mation of huge newspaper
chains, for example, have
gradually reduced the
pluralism of ideas which once
was one of the strong points of

tion charge on Oct. 25. Whether
these fraternities will be fined
more severely for future or-
dinance infractions was not
made known by the judge,
Brown said. Brown added, “The
judge was really pretty nice
about it.”

Faculty surveys
independent exams

by Galen Trussell

Questions by _ faculty
members about the security of
independent exams initiated a
survey by the Faculty E.C. to
determine the feasibility of con-
tinuing the present independent
exam schedule.

The Faculty E.C. circulated a
questionaire to all teachers ear-
ly last week. The questionaires
were to be returned to Dean At-
wood, chairman of the faculty
E.C., by Monday, October 17.
The Faculty E.C. will review
the results of the questionaire
and present a recommendation
to the faculty, either to retain or
throw out the present indepen-
dent exam schedule. The facul-
ty will then vote as a body on the
recommendation of the Faculty
E.C. at a faculty meeting to be
held November 7.

According to Dean Atwood,
the results of the survey cannot
be made public until the Facul-
ty E.C. reports its findings to
the University Council on
November 3. Atwood added that

Frosh runoffs

by Kevin Dwyer

Today’s run-off for freshman
class president and Executive
Committee representative will
determine who wins those
posts, but Robert Willis has
already. locked up the position
of freshman class vice presi-
dent.

Peter Eliades and Dutch
Waldbauer will run off for presi-
dent and Joseph Sloboda and
Christopher Gammon will vie
for the one freshman E.C. slot.

Willis won the position of vice
president outright by polling
over 50 per cent of the 244 votes
cast during Monday’s election.
He received 146 votes, or ap-
proximately 60 per cent of the
votes cast. His closest
challenger, Robert Neily
received 64 votes. Joseph
Robles had 34.

Eliades and Waldbauer
became contenders for the
presidency of the freshman
class by virtue of the fact they
received more votes than the
other five candidates. Neither
of them, however, received a
majority of the 245 votes cast.
Waldbauer was the leading
vote-getter with 65. Eliades had
45 votes cast for him. Jamie
Small was close to making the
runn-off with 35 votes, but Sam
Campbell, Marc Firestone and
J. Scott Corduzo with 29 and
John Schmidt with 13 votes fell
well behind.

In the E.C. elections, Gam-
mon made it into the runn-offs

by a mile, while Slaboda made
it by a nose. Gammon received
77 of the 244 votes cast.
Although this only represents
approximately 30 per cent of the
votes cast, Gammon. still
received almost double the
amount of votes as Slaboda,
who had 40. Slaboda just eked it
out over Robert Brooke, who
had 35 votes. Rounding out the
large E.C. aspirants were Steve
Swallow, 27 votes; Jeff
Christovich, 23. votes; Chip

he did not want to speculate on
the Faculty E. C. recommenda-
tion or on how the faculty feels.
Atwood added that if the pre-
sent independent exam
schedule is done away with it
would only mean exams would
be scheduled, not proctored.

Questions the Faculty E.C.
asked of faculty members
were:

1) Were you a _ faculty
member at Washington and Lee

before the independent ex-
amination schedule was
adopted?

2) Are you basically in favor
of continuing the independent
examination schedule?

3) Do you have personal, first-
hand knowledge of specific in-
cidences in which information
about an examination was
revealed to those who had not
taken it or who might take it?

4) Do you have any indirect,
second-hand knowledge of such
incidences? .

5) Have you ever had ex-

E.C. members commented
that the turnout of the freshman
class was about average,
although E. C. president Jim
Underhill said he thought tur-
nout was better his freshman
year. In any case, E.C.
members expressed hopes that
the turnout today would be bet-
ter than the approximately 68
per cent who voted Monday.

Potter Says:

 

Two Ariels will come out

by Lee Howard

Ariel, Washington & Lee’s
student literary magazine, is
going to be fresh, exciting and
it’s going to come out two times
this year, editor Parker Potter
said in an interview yesterday.

Skeptics on the Executive
Committee gave Ariel only
enough money to put out one
issue, telling Potter to come
back when he can “‘prove’’ he
can put out another issue. Pot-
ter said he will be back, and
sooner than the E.C. thinks. He
said he hopes Ariel will come
out by early December, but is
putting the ‘realistic’ target
date at the first day of the
winter term, in January.

Potter said he shouldn’t have
to ‘“‘prove’’ anything. Although
in recent years the Ariel has on-
ly come out once a year,
previous to that the Ariel had
come out three and even five
times a year. He said he will be

able to fill up two issues “‘even if. ; *
I have to fill the second” <
myself.” Potter said the reason. —
he is worried about the: —

Stipulated “‘proof” is that he
might have to do two-thirds of
the work on the second issue
before he finds out whether he’ll
get the money for it. He pointed
out no other student organiza-
tion has to do this in order to
secure funds.

Potter said he believes the
whole process involved in
securing E. C. funds is too
‘‘protracted.”” He said the fact
that he didn’t know how much
money he was going to be given
until Oct. 10 will delay the first
issue of Ariel because, even
after all the material has been
gathered, it takes a month of
preparation before Ariel goes to
the printer.

Survey

periences with the following:
a) exams turned in with the

question sheets missing?

b) grades increase as ex-
ams proceed?

c) answers that are
suspiciously similar?

d) any other experience?

Originally, the independent
exam schedule was initated in
the 1970-1971 school year along
with the present curriculum.
When the independent exam
schedule was initiated there
was a large minority that voted
against its installment. This
minority thought that indepen-
dent exams put too much strain
on the honor code, and therefore
weakened it. Three years after
its conception the faculty voted
to retain independent exams.
Questions about the security of
the independent exam schedule
were first voiced last spring.
The matter was raised again
this term and the faculty E.C.
was asked to circulate its peti-
tion.

Potter said he is hoping
poems in the Ariel will contain
more social commentary. This
has been difficult in the past
because W&L is such a tradi-
tional school, he said. In any
case, Potter said he doesn’t
really go for ‘‘Moon and June
type things.’’ He said he was
also interested in seeing
satirical works. In addition he
would like to see short stories,
short essays, character sket-
ches and dramatic situations,
possibly excerpts from a play.
Potter emphaized these must be
short because of the limited
space in Ariel.

One possibility . for Ariel,
which Potter said he found par-
ticularly exciting, would be to
print an issue revolving around
a central theme, but taken from
different angles.. Potter said
this possibility would come to
light in the second issue, if some
sort of unity could be maintain-
ed with his writers.

Unity was the main theme of
his organizational scheme.
Rather than having his con-
tributers leave their poems in
some box in the library, Potter
said he wants to meet them
face-to-face. The organizational
meeting yesterday (too late for
the Phi to cover) was an at-

by Rex Nyquist

Last Thursday night two
speeches were given and a
debate was held on campus. In
Lee Chapel, Contact ‘78 kicked
off its program with Sir Robert
Mark. The Journalism depart-
ment presented John Merrill in
duPont, while the debate team
argued Oxford University’s
squad in the Moot Court Room
in Lewis Hall.

The scheduling left some peo-
ple asking: ‘‘Why were three
events held on the same
night?”’

It now seems, however, that
there was little that could be
done about it. All three events
were arranged separately, and
in each case the W&L Contact
had little say in the arrange-
ment.

Professor Jennings of the
journalism department said of
the Merrill speech: ‘‘Merrill is
one of the speakers of the
Visiting Scholars of Virginia
program. We had little say in
the scheduling of the speech.”

The speech, scheduled in mid-
September, had to be on the
date the Visiting Scholars Pro-
gram assigned the school if they
wanted him to speak. There
were about 125 people at the
speech. Jennings estimated
that about half of them were re-
quired to attend for classes.

The debate was also schedul-
ed by an outside agency.
Halford Ryan, coach of the
team, said that the debate was
arranged in late August. The
Speech Commonwealth
Association (the liason for the
British team) sent Ryan a ques-
tionnaire asking if he would like

to have the debaters, and if so,

tempt to do so. Potter said he
hopes to make these meetings a
regular thing. He also said
seminars in which contributors
make critical suggestions for
other writers to improve their
work would be a possibility.

Potter said he will be working
closely with Dabney Stuart, a
professor and creative writing
teacher in the English depart-
ment, who has contacts with the
school’s creative writers. He
said he will also be working
closely with Chris Volk, whom
he recently appointed as
photography editor.
Photography is a major part of
Ariel’s presentation, and Volk,
as former editor of the Calyx,
has contacts with most of
W&L/’s finest picture takers.

Potter summarized the up-
coming year for Ariel by saying
that the first issue must come
out early so it will be placed in
the ‘‘public conscienceness.”
The second issue is ‘‘going to be
the exciting one,’’ he said. This
is the one he considers to be his
baby. The first one will basical-
ly be put out to satisfy the E.C.
The second one will aim for.
some larger design of literary
quality within each selection
and thematic quality within the
entire context of the Ariel.

when he would like to have
them.

However, Ryan said, the
ultimate choice was made by
the Association, and he had to
take or leave the date he got.
About 25 people attended the
debate. Dr. Ryan said that he
was not aware that Contact had
scheduled a presentation for the
same evening.

Washers Broken

by Jim Ingham

The laundry service offered
to freshmen in the basement of
Graham-Lees Dorm will be im-
proved. Plans are being made
to add security to the room, to
educate the students on how to
use the washers and dryers
more efficiently, and, ultimate-
ly to add more machines. Jerry
Darrell, in charge of this ser-
vice as well as the University
food services, said that if he had
his way, the above plans will be
implemented after a freshman

Disorganization in scheduling

Meanwhile, Sir Robert Mark
spoke to about 200 people in Lee
Chapel. Contact co-chairman
Billy Webster said that Mark
was signed last April through
Lordly Dame, Inc. Contact had
a choice of twelve dates to have
him. They received last Thurs-
day, apparently because Mark
was scheduled to speak at the
College of William and Mary on
Friday night.

Thus, it seems like the
scheduling of three cratorical
events on the same night was an
unfortunate coincidence. At
least nobody can complain that
there was nothing to do.

steering committee is formed
and decides on the specifics of
how the new operation will be
run.

The washers and dryers in the
Graham-Lee Dorm _ have
always been a source of discon-
tent among freshmen. The main
problem is that four washers
and four dryers are just not
enough for the number of
students who need to use them.
One freshman noted that the
number of machines is so inade-
quate that ‘you sometimes
have to do your wash in the mid-
dle of the night.’’ This causes a
good number of people to look
for somewhere else to do their
wash.

Another problem voiced is
that the dryers take two or
three quarters to do a load of
wash. Not only does this make
the service more expensive and
time consuming but it also
means that less people have a
chance to get their clothes done.
The dryers have also been
plagued by such things as
broken doors and the washers
have in the past skipped the
rinse cycle.

Darrell attributes these pro-
blems to a lot of factors. He
acknowledged that there is in-
deed a need for more washers
and dryers. But as for the quali-
ty of the equipment, he pointed
to the fact that these machines
are misused a lot of time. He
stated that a maximum load of

October 20. On the election
front, another motion limiting
campaign spending to five
dollars and media exposure to
twenty posters passed with one
dissenting vote. Law School
representative Rick Goddard,
speaking on behalf of his vote
against the motion, quipped
that there was ‘“‘too much trash

on this campus already.”
Moving beyond regular
business, president Jim

Underhill spoke of the present
dichotomy of opinion between
the faculty and the Executive
Committee in regards to in-
dependent exams. Underhill in-
dicated in his speech that time
was running out on the E.C. and
that the committee would soon
have to take a stand. Underhill
pointed out that the faculty felt
that its role in the Exam pro-
cess was ambiguous. In noting
the faculty desire for added
specificity, the president
discussed two hypothetical
situations where rigid pro-
cedure could help: exams hand-
ed in late and finals taken in
another building such as the
Library. Presently there is no
set punishment for these of-
fenses.

At this point, Griffin added

that the situation of Indepen-
dent Exams would not be fully
known until the results of a
faculty poll conducted by the
Faculty Executive Committee
were tabulated. Griffin also
spoke of the concern expressed
to him by many faculty
members that freshmen did not
know the proper pledge. Griffin
continued by saying that faculty
members speculated that this
lack of knowledge on the part of
the freshmen might be a result
of a breakdown in the orienta-
tion process at Natural Bridge.
At the request of Griddwn, the
correct pledge is:
”’On my honour, I have neither
given nor received any
unacknowledged aid on this
exam, (test or paper).”’

The irony of this part of the
meeting lay in the fact that,
when asked by an uninformed
sophomore in the audience for
the official pledge, none of the
eleven members could recite it.
But the vice president joked,
“the problem is whether or not
the E goes before the I in receiv-
ed.”’

 

Trussell

chosen...

 

The final topic of the night
was the selection of the Univer-
sity Center Committee chair-
man. The duties of the U.C.C.
entail the maintenance of the
University Center Library and
Fairfax Lounge and the super-
vision of Cockpit entertain-
ment. The only two applicants
were Tony Carli and Galen
Trussell, both members of the
Student Activities Board.

In his testimony, Carli, but-
tressed by S.A.B. co-chairman
Charlie Hulfish, said he could
be a good liaison between the
S.A.B.,secthe Cockpit, and
W&L Student Music Union.

Carli, applying for the job at the
request of S.A.B. secretary
Tom McCarthy, stated that with
the present budget only two acts
per week were feasible. The
aspiring sophomore also took a
strong stand against any cover
charge to counteract the fiscal
strain of an expensive act say-
ing, “it seems ridiculous to
charge students for something
they’ve already paid.’’ Carli
saw no reason not to permit
‘Veemees’ to use the Cockpit.

Trussell, stating his case, an-
nounced that he wanted to exer-.
cise creativity for cockpit enter-
tainment. Trussell continued by
saying that, as a_ present
member of the Student Ac-
tivities Board and the Student
Music Union, he could supply
the initiative, the knowledge,
and the energy necessary to im-
plement his innovative ideas on
Cockpit entertainment. The
Trussell plan called for four or
five high quality weekend acts
during the year with the rest of
the entertainment being sup-
plied gratuitously by perform-
ing members of the Student
Music Union. Trussell further
testified that he had prior ex-
perience in booking bands for
different engagements and that
as the lone eagle on the S.A.B.,
his usefulness was being wasted
because of personal
“animosities” on that commit-
tee and constant degradation of
his unique viewpoint. This
adverse situation on the S.A.B.,
claimed Trussell mostly ex-
plained his rather sketchy at-
tendance record at S.A.B.
meetings as compared with
Carli’s impeccable record to
date.

As soon as the two applicants
stepped out of the room to await
the results, committee discus-
sion began to flow. Doug
Perkins opened by saying that
Trussell would be an asset to
the U.C.C. for his connections
with the Student Music Union;
an advantage Carli lacked.
Rick Goddard foll owed
Perkins’ lead that Galen
Trussell, although lacking in
areas of the U.C.C. outside of
the entertainment sector, would
be ‘important to see the music
thing off the ground.” S.A.B. co-
chairman Hulfish, openly favor-
ing Carli, reminded the E.C.
that the job they were debating
required a “vigilant worker”’
willing to show up every day.

Then Neil Pentifallo raised
the question of the disparity of
the performance records of the
two applicants, feeling that past
facts and actions argued in
favour of Carli. Steve Abraham
snapped back that, based on
S.A.B. meetings he attended
last year, “the meetings are
ridiculous.” Abraham em-
phasized his empathy for
Trussell in his abortive efforts
to bring a dimension of diversi-
ty to the musical entertainment
on the W&L campus. Junior
representative Jack Bovay, a .
staunch Carli supporter, felt
that, “Tony is much more
responsible” in carrying out all
of the duties inherent in the job.

Mike Missal backed up Bovay
by pointing out that, to be suc-
cessful, the U.C.C. chairman
would have to have good rela-
tions and strong ties with the
S.A.B. and that Trussell; given
his past experiences with the
Hulfish crew, would have a
great deal of difficulty sustain-
ing either.

Sophomore E.C. member An-
dy Bodenstab tried, in a brief
and futile effort, to propose a
con. promise of having Carli and
Trussel serve as co-chairmen.
The Bodenstab solution called
for the best of both applicants;
the musical connections of
Galen combined with Tony’s

unblemished feliability for the
day-to-day operation of the
University Center.

Vice president’ Griffin
favored Trussell’s appointment
on the rationale that Trussel
could be more useful as the
U.C.C. chairman than as a
frustrated radical on the S.A.B.
Jim Underhill closed the debate
by stating that, although ‘‘Tony
is better in the other aspects,”
that Trussell was the better
choice because he could act as a
“bigger mediary between the
two groups,” (the Student
Music Union and the University
Center Committee). Underhill
concluded on Trussell’s behalf,
“T think we really need the
cooperation of the S.M.U. with

abstentions to accept the ap-
plication of Galen Trussell for
chairman of the University
Center Committee, with Neil
Pentifallo, Mike Missal, Jack
Bovay, and Andy Bodenstab
holding out for Tony Carli. So, a
meeting that started with
whemper ended with a grum-
ble; a grumble merely porten-

Tracy, Hepburn, and the
‘Great American Movie Buff’

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

Of all the types of people in
this world of ours, with all their
divergent interests, the one cult
which has always had a special
appeal for me is the “movie
buff.’’ For those of us who have
some right to claim the title, it
is cherished almost as identity
card—and with good reason.
There really aren’t that many
movie buffs in the classic sense
roaming about.

With all due respect, those of
you who have seen The Sound of
Music five times simply don’t
qualify, despite arguments to
the contrary. The real movie
buff may be recognized by a
more in-depth knowledge, such
as knowing the answers to the
folldwing: How many parts
does Frank Morgan play, aside
from the Wizard, in The Wizard
of Oz? What was the first real
“‘all-star’’ movie? (Hint: it was
Best Picture in its year of
release) Who played Lola in
The Blue Angel?What actress
brought movie censorship into
being almost totally as a result
of her bawdy one-liners? For
what film did Bogart receive his
only Oscar? On and on and on
they go...

Yes, the movie buff is a rare
combination of steadfast devo-
tion and unflagging energy. He
is the type whose favorite view-
ing hours on the tube are bet-
ween 11 and 4 in the morning.
You find him clustered in a
small group watching James
Gagney and Jean Harlow, while
the majority make do with the
network offerings. Or in the
front row of the local ‘‘revival-
house,”’ existing on stale pop-
corn and flat orangeade. He
generally knows the screenplay
of Casablanca by heart, and

never mentions Gone With the
Wind except with eyes raised to
heaven, or body bowed towards
Mecca.

It is this vary group of people
that the SAB is catering to this
weekend, a fairly ‘“‘off’’ one in
most other respects. The SAB
movie this week is a classic:
State of the Union, directed by
Frank Capra, starring
Katharine Hepburn and
Spencer Tracy. The place for
the vintage 1948 flick is duPont
auditorium, at 7 & 9 Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday. The
cost—a mere dollar.

Tracy and Hépburn— pro-
bably the team of all Hollywood
dramatic teams. In their nine
films together, they achieved a
consistent level’ of excellence,
wit, and appeal rarely matched.
They were indeed a good reflec-
tion of the overall grandeur of
their home studio, MGM, which
was the king of them all through
the movies’ golden age. MGM,
quite simply, had the best of
everything, and more of it than
anyone else! Astaire, Kelly,
Sinatra, Gable, Garland...they
all called it home. But none
were as highly acclaimed as
these two.

Friends on and off the set,
they were two divergent per-
sonalities. Hepburn was (and
still is) the creative foun-
tainhead, bursting with ideas,
who loves nothing more than
directing the director. Tracy,
calm and so realistic that he
seemed to ‘walk through a
scene the way he walks through
life,” was often considered the
greatest of them all by his
peers.

Conflicts were often
unavoidable between the two.
As Stanley Kramer once
related, ‘‘She will constantly ex-
amine the material for that lit-

Eye and Ear:
from the Bookstore

Three new and hot releases on
the music scene this fall are
Randy Newman’s Little
Criminals, Jean-Luc Ponty’s
Enigmatic Ocean, and Tom
Waits’ Foreign Affairs. All
three of these records show
these musicians moving again
in the directions that made
them famous.

Newman’s Little Criminals is
the first thing from the
singer/songwriter since Good
Old Boys some 3!,years ago. It
has been worth the wait. Per-
sonnel featured on the album in-
clude Joe Walsh and a good
many of the Eagles. The songs
range from tunes with a sense
of humor to chillingly melodic
social criticism (Baltimore is
an example of this). If you’re an
old Newman fan this is a must.
And if you’ve never heard of
him now is the time to listen.

Tom Waits’ new Foreign Af-

 

fairs, his follow-up to the
critically acclaimed Small
Change, features Waits’
wonderful raspy voice doing
more sad songs in bars. The
overall effect is something like
a cross between Randy
Newman and Louis Armstrong
with three bottles of Jack
Daniels thrown in. Very ex-
citing and listenable with occa-
sional passages which make
you sigh, “I’ve been there.”’

Which brings us to Jean-Luc
Ponty. Violin Virtuoso Ponty
continues his jazz spectrum in
Enigmatic Ocean in much the
same manner as on last year’s
Imag-nary Voyage. The free
flowing progressive sound is
there as usual and as usual Pon-
ty is always right on top of
things. The overall sound is
strong, very strong, and invites
aural exploration. Highly
recommended.

tle piece of something that will
bring it alive or make it funnier
or more poignant.’’ That is, un-
til Tracy, the original one-take
actor, has his fill, and snaps,
“Why don’t you just mind your
own damn business, read the
lines, do what he says, and let’s
get on with it?” Hepburn may
have bristled for a moment at
this, but it always ended in a
good-natured laugh. And “‘get
on with it’’ they did indeed...

State of the Union, though
made almost thirty years ago,
is a movie timeless in its
theme—political ambition.
Tracy plays the part of a man
who is manuevered into the
Republican nomination for
President. Hepburn is his
estranged wife who returns to
him to improve the electoral
chances. The film shows Tracy, -
under the influence of the usual
backers, sacrificing all his prin-
ciples to his ambition. But the
ever-inventive Hepburn as the
wife, seeing her husband’s
state, moves full steam ahead
to save him, in spite of himself.
The result is a wise, witty, and
thoroughly enjoyable show.

The critics of 1948 hailed the
film as a “triumph.” But the
game of politics is still the
Ssame—only the names
change—andState of the Union
still has a moral to give us, no
doubt.

State of the Union is the pro-
duct of many talented people,
not least director Capra. One of
the few directors, like DeMille
or Hitchcock, who had a fan
following similar to the stars,
Capra was also one of the
greatest egotists in the
business. In this film, his name
not only appears before the two
stars, but before the title!

Even so, we always come
back to the easy styles of Tracy
and Hepburn. One thing that I
think we all marvel about in
their movies is the seeming lack
of effort it took to produce such
a great film. And it was just
that to them—easy. Spencer
Tracy’s comments serve as a
fine conclusion:

“I don’t like anything about
acting. But I did very well by it.
It’s never been very deman-
ding. It doesn’t require much
brainwork. Acting is not the
noblest profession in the world,
but there are things lower than
acting — not many, mind you —
but politicians give you
something to look down on from
time to time.”

(Note: For the curious, the
answers to those questions
above were 4 or 5, Grand Hotel,
Marlene Dietrich, Mae West,
and The African Queen...)

THE NOSE KNOWS

Well here goes, let’s see how
much trouble I can get myself
into this week. I realize that I
have been given ghe E’s a hard
time. Granted they deserve it
but I think its time I lay off
them. For god’s sake some peo-
ple were beginning to think I
was black.

We have reason to believe
that a certain member of the
E.C. who last year said he
would pay his own way to the
E.C. party has yet to do so.

A certain member of the
Athletic staff was said to have
made some very damaging
statements about the editor of
the Phi. It’s a shame we
couldn’t print them. Matter of
fact, why couldn’t we?

While we are on the subject of
harmful statements is it true

that a certain member of the
alumni office has been accused
of Dirty Rushing several frater-

_nities this summer. I think

before certain administrative
officials start chastising year-
book editors for printing
degrading pictures of their
fraternity they best clean up
their own offices.

Baldwin’s Apple Day was
another flop. Wahoos galore. I
think Baldwin is the only one of
the girls schools that tries to
make money off of their social
functions.

The first clue on Fancy Drunk
theme—It’s not of the western
hemisphere and the invitations
will be written on a strange
form of paper.

Musical Mainstream

by Mark Mainwaring
and Ward Boult

Live albums used to be pro-
duced sparingly, primarily as
an inexpensive, almost ef-
fortless way for an artist or
band to keep their fans happy
between studio releases. Ever
since the phenomenal success
ofFrampton Comes Alive,
though, live albums have pro-
liferated almost ad nauseum,
released mostly by _lesser-
known bands hoping to make
their own Frampton-like
breakthrough. This week in
Mainstream, we’ll review two
of the more interesting recent
live LPs.

Love You Live
Rolling Stones
Rolling Stones Records
COC 2-9001

Recorded in Paris and Toron-
to in 1976-77, Love You Live is
the second live album released
by the Rolling Stones. And
whether you compare it to the
band’s first live LP (Get Yer
Ya-Ya’s Out) or with recent live
releases by other groups, the
record is a disappointment. For
most of the Paris concert
(which takes up three sides of
the album), the Stones seem to
be simply going through the mo-
tions. The instrumental work,
for the most part, is good and
nothing more, and Mick Jag-
ger’s vocals range from
mediocre to just plain sloppy.

Side three of Love You Live,
recorded at the El Macambo
club in Toronto, is a different
story. After years of playing in
stadiums and hockey arenas,
the Stones finally go back to
their beginnings on this side of
the album, both physically
(playing to a small audience)
and musically (playing blues-
based rock). The members of
the band are quite obviously en-
joying themselves, and the in-

timate feeling of this part of the
album (especially after the
remoteness of the other three
sides) nearly redeems_ the
whole record, but can’t quite
pull it off. By nearly every ac-
count, the Rolling Stones are in-
credibly good in concert, and
it’s too bad their onstage energy
didn’t survive the transfer to
vinyl. Love You Live seems to
be a classic case of ‘‘you had to
be there.”

MM

Night After Night
Nils Lofgren
A&M SP-3707

If you were a bit worried
about Nils Lofgren after hear-
ing his last album, fear not. Nils
is back, and this time he is live
and kickin’.

Amidst the avalanche of dou-
ble live albums, Night After
Night comes as a fresh sur-
prise. The album was recorded
during 1977 at the
Hammersmith-London,
England, the Apollo Theater-
Glasgow, Scotland, and the
Roxy in Los Angeles. The band
(essentially the same that
played on I Came to Dance) is
exceptional: Nils Lofgren-lead
guitar and vocals, Tom
Lofgren-guitar (yes, they’re
brothers), Wornell ‘‘Sonic
Prince’ Jones-bass_ guitar,
Reverend Patrick Henderson-
piano and organ, and David
Patshon on drums. The
material on the album was all
wirtten by Nils Lofgren-some
new, some old. Recent tunes in-
clude “‘Cry Tough,”’ ‘‘It’s Not a
Crime,’ ‘‘Incidentally...It’s
Over,”’ ‘‘Code of the Road,”’ and
“I Came to Dance.’ Also
featured are a few songs from
Lofgren’s old band, Grin.

Night After Night is chock full
of Lofgren’s special brand of
rock and roll. His music is sum-
med up in the lyrics “I ain’t no

the album is typical Lofgren—
he wrenches it out no matter
what it takes.

The album does have its weak
points (background vocals, for
example), but these are easily

several other members of the

Guitarist Excels In Lee Chapel

by Robert Tremblay

Throughout the history of
music, the classical guitar has
been, for the most part, un-
fortunately neglected. The
reasons for this could be due to
the ‘beliefs’ that the guitar
does not display the bravura of
a piano or the graceful singing
style of a violin, the piano and
the violin beging two of the
more popular solo instruments.
But one only had to hear Peter
Corey Tuesday night at Lee
Chapel to realize that these
‘‘beliefs’’ are unsubstantiated.

Mr. Corey’s brilliant guitar
work exhibited in some parts of
his program a flamboyance
usually only associated with the
piano, and in others, a cantabile
character found more typically
in the violin. His technique, his
feeling for the instrument, his
interpretations all displayed a
maturity of style not usually
associated with a performer so
young (Mr. Corey is only 19).
His scalar passages were in-
credibly smoth, his counter-
point clear, but what was even
more impressive was Mr. Cor-
ey’s apparent ease in publishing
these technically demanding
areas. His concert was, in a
word, spectacular.

It would be pointless for me to
comment on each work as far as
quality is concerned because I’d
be using the same superlative in
almost every case: excellent.
But these pieces deserve men-
tion anyways for they show the
variety of style that Mr. Corey’s
concert displayed. The Weiss
Lute Suite No. 4in G opened the
program. It is a charming
piece, but more importantly, it
allowed Mr. Corey a chance to
immediately exhibit the grace
and technical ability of the
classical guitar. The Chaconne
by Bach was originally written

Christmas Special, taped short-
ly before Crosby’s recent death.
The two singers will team up on
several songs, including a ren-
dition of ‘“‘Litthke Daummer
Boy” (?!)....0n the local
scene, WLUR’s ‘90 Minutes
With...”’ will begin a new season
next Thursday, Oct. 27, at 10:30
p.m. “90 Minutes with Alice
Cooper” will feature an ex-
clusive phone interview with
Alice himself, plus plenty of
good music. Future shows will
focus on Emerson Lake &
Palmer, Chris deBurgh, and a
host of others....Finally, the sta-
tion has received some ex-
cellent entries in the “Design a
WLUR Logo” contest. The con-
test winner will receive his or
her choice of one of the follow-
ing double albums:
ELP—Works, Volume 1, Elvis
Presley In Concert, John
Coltrane—Afro Blue Impres-
sions, or Bob deMaria Sings 20
Polka Favorites. If you’dlike to
submit a design, bring it by the
third floor of Reid Hall anytime
during business hours.

See you next time in

for the violin, but the rapid runs
and trills in it were superbly
handled. The Sor Fantasia No.
1, Op. 7 was another piece that
would put to rest the idea that
the guitar lacks the technical
prowess of the piano. Many
large intervallic leaps and
tricky finger work highlight this
piece. The Fandanguillo by
Turina brought to the
foreground the different tone
coloring that the guitar is
capable of. By tapping the str-
ings of the guitar with the palm
of his hand (the technique is
called tambora). Mr. Corey ef-
fectively produced the variety
of sound that Turina was in-
terested in. The Sonatina by
Berkeley was written for the
guitar virtuoso Julian Bream,
but Mr. Corey performed the
composition with a flair almost
suggesting that the piece was
written for him. The concert
was concluded with a Canzonet-
ta by Mendelssohn, which was
originally written for string

Soccer Team

Lynched

by Chris Fay

The soccer team lost to Lyn-
chburg Saturday. Lynchburg
won 5 to 0, they piled up 4 goals
in the first half. The Generals
have lost the last three games
on the road.

Four goals were scored in the
first half against the Generals.
The first goal was on a Lyn-
chburg penalty kick. The
Generals set up their defensive
wall, Kevin Carney waited at
the far side of the net. But the
scorer shot the ball over the
fullbacks and the side of the net
away from Carney into the goal.

On the second goal, the Lyn-
chburg player shot on Carney.
He stretched himself out in time
to stop the shot, but couldn’t
control the ball. The shooter ran
in to kick the ball further from
Carney, then he pushed it in.

On the third Lynchburg goal
the player dribbled past the
Generals’ fullbacks and suc-
cessfully shot on goal.

The fourth goal scored by a
Lynchburg player involved
pushing one of the Generals off
the ball from behind. Then he
kicked the ball in to score.

In the second half the
Generals tryed to regain
themselves. The last goal was

on a penalty shot against the
Generals. The scorer drilled it
by Carney to score.

The Generals played badly in
the first half, but came back to
allow only one Lynchburg goal
in the second half. A week of
practice without a game might
have hurt the Generals.

Back Into Top Ten

What do you do against a
team that is bigger, stronger,
faster and meaner than you?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Washington and Lee satisfied
that prophesy Saturday,
managing a grand total of 10
yards on 35 carries as the
Hampden-Sydney Tigers
demolished them 49-0.

The Tigers scored on their
first seven possessions, inspired
by the fact that they had been
dropped from No. 7 on the
NCAA Division III poll to mere-
ly honorable mention. H-S was
nearly perfect in rolling up a
35-0 halftime lead, insuring
W&L’s sixth straight loss. The
closest the Generals got to scor-
ing was in the fourth quarter

Water Polo Team Loses Up North;
No Post Season Play For W&L

by Jim Barnes

‘‘We were blown out of the
pool,” according to water polo
coach Bill Stearns, refering to
last weekend’s trip up to the
Northeast. The Generals lost all
four of their conference games
and with that any chance of post
season play in the Middle Atlan-
tic Conference. Had _ the
Generals managed to win over
out of the four contests they
would have gone to the Middle
Atlantic Tournament at West
Point.

The team went up to Universi-
ty Park Pensylvania Friday for
their first game in a confident
frame of mind on the merits of
their early season _ per-
formance. But confidence
wasn't enough to stop a quicker
and more experienced Penn
State team. This was a problem
the team faced the entire
weekend.

‘“Speedwise,”’ said Stearns,
“‘T know we have as good swim-
mers as any of the ofher teams

in our conference. But we just
don’t have the quickness, or
reactions that the more ex-
perienced teams have.’’ The
failure of the team can be at-
tributed to W&L’s inability to
react as well as the other teams
in the league to penalty whistles
and flags.

On Saturday the team travel-
ed to New York to face Slippery
Rock in the morning and Col-
umbia and Villanova in the
afternoon. In each game the
Generals reduced their losing
margin. They were walloped in
their first match against Slip-
pery Rock 17-5, lost by nine
points to Columbia 18-9 and
were barely beaten’ by
Villanova, losing 13-10.

“I think we should have won
the game against Villanova,”’
said Stearns. He feels that had
the team played Villanova first
when they were confident and
not so tired they would have
won the game. ‘‘We’re going to
emphasize fundamentals in

practice these next few weeks.
That’s the only way you can
compensate for a iack of speed.
You’ve got to play good fun-
damental water polo if you
aren’t quick.”

Right now the team is looking
forward to the state champion-
ships that will be played at the
Cy Twombly Pool in Doremus
Gymnasium during parents’
weekend. Stearns believes that
his team has a better chance to

when they managed to get to the
three yard line, only to give up
the ball on downs.

The Tigers didn’t go to their
scrubs until the score was 42-0.
That fact, plus the fact H-S tried
some razzle-dazzle, like a fake
punt and a halfback touchdown
pass, made some persons ac-
cuse the Tigers of running up
the score to get back in the top
10. W&L assistant coaches
chewed out H-S head coach
Stokely Fulton for those plays.
H-S also chose to go for first
downs rather than field goals on
three different occasions. The
three plays led to two
touchdowns.

The first score was on a
fourth-and-eight, Tiger quarter-
back Dale Marks threading the
needle for a:13 yard pass to Ben
Newell. The second touchdown
was scored after the Tigers
went for a fourth-and-three on
the 16 and a fourth-and-one on
the goal line.

The Tigers ran up a total of
427 yards to 137 for W&L. H-S
had almost three times as many
plays as the Generals, grinding
out 81 plays to W&L’s 31. The
best way to describe the Tigers
scoring plays is to say they had
seven of them and none of them
were done the same way.

The Generals, showing an
eight man line just about the
whole game, were burned by
the pass. Eleven different
Tigers caught passes, while H-S
quarterbacks connected on 19 of
28 passes for 251 yards.

The Tigers even got lucky.
When halfback Bill Moore
fumbled in the W&L endzone,
guard Skip Sudduth fell on it for
a touchdown.

Scott Swope, the Generals’
junior quarterback, was the on-
ly bright spot. He threw for 100
yards on a six for fourteen ef-
fort. Ted Hissey completed
three of five but for only 30
yards. W&L quarterbacks had
it tough, though, being sacked
for 59 yards in losses.

The Tigers’ win keeps them in
first place in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference at 2-0. The
Generals are 0-2 in the ODAC.
They go against the University
of the South, better known as
Sewanee, Saturday. The
Generals won last year’s con-
test 16-14. Sewanee graduated
15 starters from last year’s 5-4
team and are presently 1-4.
Sewanee will be trying to even
the series of the long-time
rivalry at 13-13. Their nickname
is also the Tigers. No relation,
we hope.

‘Cross Country

Distant Second

by Clem Carter

Washington and Lee’s Cross
Country team split a three way
meet in Bridgewater last Fri-
day. Bridgewater, described by
Coach Miller as a ‘“‘strong”
team took first place with just
17 points. The Generals were a
distant second with 48 points,
Roanoke was third with a point
total of 72.

Bridgewater, led by Curt
Rowland, took five of the top six
places, sweeping the first three.
Rowland ran the 8000 meter
course in 25 minutes and 55
seconds, Allen Weeks was the
top General. de took fourth
place overall. Weeks was slight-
ly under a minute off the winn-
ing pace with a time of 26
minutes and 50 seconds. The se-
cond Washington and Lee run-
ner was Chris Daniels, He took
eighth place with a time of 27

Tennis Team
Splits Two Matches

At 9:00 a.m. on Saturday,
W&L plays Ohio on the W&L
courts, while Virginia and
Maryland square off at VMI.
Final action is set for 1:30 p.m.
on Saturday when W&L and
Maryland play at W&L, and

Virginia and Ohio play at VMI.
Bussard lists UVa as the
favorite with the remaining
three teams all having a shot at
the title. This is the W&L
team’s final action of the fall

minutes and 19 seconds. Bob
Bates followed in ninth place
with a time of 27 minutes and 28
seconds. The fourth and fifth
men for Washington and Lee
were Brian Adams and Richard
Bird, respectively. They finish-
ed 13th and 14th overall with
times of 28 minutes, two
seconds and 28 minutes 24
seconds. Kevin Grimm and Bill
Welch were 15th and 17th to
close out the top seven men for
the Generals.

Coach Miller would give no
excuses for Washington and
Lee’s defeat in a meet which
one runner described as ‘‘mild-
ly disappointing.’’ Miller sum-
med the meet up by saying:
“We didn’t run well.’’ The
Generals’ record now stands at
nine wins and three loses. They
are two wins and two loses in

the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference.

Washington and Lee is open
this coming week. An op-
portunity which Coach Miller
will use to take the team to
Roanoke College on Saturday to
run the course that will be used
for the ODAC meet on
November 5th. The next time
the Generals will run will be in
Lexington on October 29th
against powerful James
Madison University and
Eastern Mennonite.

Frats Too Rough

 

I-M Football Out of Hand

by Jim Barnes

Apparently unnecessary
roughness is not limited to the
NHL or the NFL, but is also an
element of the W&L IM football
program. Whether it is the lack
of competent officials, or over
zealous jocks, there has been an
increased incidence of injuries
in IM football this year over
years past.

IM faculty advisor Verne
Canfield says, ‘‘We can’t get
enough competent officials to
call the games.’’ Each
organization that fields a team
is also supposed to provide a
‘competent official for another
game. The official gets two
dollars for every game he calls.
The IM office attempted to hold
clinics for the. prospective of-
ficials to point out to them the
penalties that frequently occur
in IM football. Unfortunatly
these clinics were not well at-
tended. When you have a foot-
ball game that is being
carelessly officiated there’s a
good chance that the game can
get out of control.

Canfield says that it’s come to
his attention that some
organizations ‘‘have taken ad-
vantage of the situation. Some
organizations are forgetting the
spirit of IM’s.” He threatens to
“nail the particular frats if it

continues,”’ or to ‘‘cancel the IM
football program.”

Several IM officials substan-
tiate the reports of increased
roughness on the IM field. One
official stated, ‘‘Some frats are
getting out of control.”’ Another
official said,’ ‘‘There’re ex-
jocks who are playing like they
used to on Saturday after-
noons.”” The organizations
whose names consistently came
up when violence is mentioned
are Fiji, Sae, and PhiPsi. It
seems that the Fijis in par-
ticular are the roughest. In
games that they have played in
several opponents have receiv-
ed bloddy noses, and one player
had his shoulder seperated in a
game.

Fiji President Charlie Brown
denied that his team players
were ‘dirty, or cheap shot ar-
tists.” Brown said, ‘‘When
you’ve got automatic rush,
some ex-football players on
your team, and poor officials,
an IM football game is going to
be rough. Brown denies that
any injuries sustained whil
playing the Fijis were the
results of rough play on the Fi-
ji’s part. Brown believes that if
the officials would do their job
and control the game there
would be no problems.

$3.5 Million Gym
to be dedicated

In Lexington this Friday,
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s Board of Trustees will of-
ficially dedicate the new $3.25-
million addition to W&L’s gym-
nasium facilities.

The 100,000-sqaure-foot ex-
pansion will be named for
Jonathan W. “Jack” Warner, a
graduate of W&L and now a
member of the Board of
Trustees, Warner is the presi-
dent and chairman of the board
of ‘‘Gulf States Paper Corpora-
tion’’ in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

The ceremony is set for 5 p.m.
W&L’s trustees will be holding

   

their autumn board meeting on
the campus Friday and Satur-
day, and the dedication will
take place as part of those ac-
tivities.

The gym expansion contains
a 2,500-seat basketball arena; a
regulation-size swimming pool
with a balcony for 500 spec-
tators; a wrestling room; ten
courts for handball, paddleball
and squash; physical education
classrooms; training and equip-
ment rooms; and _ locker
facilities for every indoor sport,
and for general student and
faculty use.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Where credit is due

It is indeed a lamentable occasion when one must
praise the government on its handling of issues. One
hates to give the government credit for anything
good, but sometimes it is unavoidable. Some people
try to avoid praising the government by saying it is
not the government that deserves the praise, but
rather the people working in the government. The
“government” remains the mysterious evil menace it
has always been; it’s just that a different and better
group of people control it.

To apply this discussion to the Washington and Lee
community would have seemed ludicrous in the past.
It was a commonly held belief that the E.C. was just a
‘punch of lazy, do-nothing preppies.’’ Well, there are
still a couple of preppies on the E.C., but if the first
couple of weeks are to be any indication of what is to
come, the 1977-78 E.C. might prove itself to be a good
one.

Their action concerning two issues is evidence in
point. First, they have shown their responsibility to
the honor system and their concern for its effec-
tiveness by taking a summer survey. Second, they
have taken a gamble by taking some of the entertain-
ment power away from the S.A.B. and giving it to the
Music Union.

Not only does the summer survey show the E.C.
members’ concern for the honor system, but at pre-
sent the E.C. is working closely with the faculty in try-
ing to keep the independent exam system. If past
E.C.’s had gotten the kinks out of the system in its
early years, we wouldn’t have the problems we are
having now. Whether or not we keep the independent
exam system depends largely on how good a job the
E.C. members can do in expressing the student
body’s feelings to the faculty. It seems this year’s
members are more comfortable with the delegate
role than with the trustee role they took in the past.
This is the type of representation we want and need at
an important time such as this.

. By giving the Music Union the opportunity to book
entertainment acts into the Cockpit, the E.C. has
broken away from tradition. Now, people with
knowledge of good music and nose for the ‘“‘good”’ act
will be allowed to bring entertainment to campus. No
longer will the cursed S.A.B. with their famous bad
taste in music have the final and only word on what
acts will appear and when they will appear on cam-
pus.

The campus is already reaping the profits from the
good sense decision of the E.C. An excellent act ap-
peared in the Cockpit last weekend, another last
night, and three more are scheduled before the week
runs out. An alternative to fraternity partying and go-
ing down the road’’ has been given to the student
population. This is perhaps the best thing that has
happened to this campus in years—entertainment
alternatives that can be enjoyed during the week as
well as on the weekend. The new E.C. deserves thanks
for this special blessing.

Even with these reasons, some people can still find
fault with the ‘“‘government’’—the E.C. Not every
organization got what it desired during the budget
hearings. Some were cut unjustly, others justly.
Mistakes were unquestionably made, but the E.C. is
composed of humans, notorious for making mistakes.

So, even though some people will disregard points
in its favor and continue to be disenchanted with the
E.C., they may find some consolation in one aspect of
the 1977-78 E. C. Rick Goddard has cut his hair. What
more could you ask?

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

 

Rag -- rag °** rag!

To the Editor:

Your editorial in last week’s
Phi was one of the few acts that
could possibly be more
outrageous than the activities
that led up to the arrests of two
fraternity presidents recently.

Living in the midst of a
number of fraternity houses I
can say from first hand ex-
perience that the noise level of
weekend partying has been
alarming. On several occasions
my wife and I have left our
apartment for some quiet and
have returned home at 1 a.m. to
the raucous sounds of high wat-
tage stereos, breaking windows
and bottles, primitive war
cries, banging garbage cans
and cars peeling out. Is the in-
tensity of our academic respon-
sibilities so great that it
justifies this type of behavior?

Your lord of the plantation at-
titude towards the towns people
is quite humorous. Having
worked in several restaurants
in town I feel free to say that the
W&L man is not the ideal
customer. I have seen
waitresses go untipped and be
abused by our gentlemen
regularly.

Your attitudes concerning
W&L jobs for townspeople,
tourist money, and traffic fines
are quite the punk ones.

You might consider that if the
fraternity members living in
this city do no wich to act in ac-
cordance with the behavior that
the city laws dictate there is a
plethora of secluded spots sur-
rounding the city where out-
siders will not be subjected to
the effects of the
undergraduates hormonal in-
balances.

Finally, I would suggest that
you would do better to improve
the editorial and mechanical
content of your rag then to show
off your threatening knowledge
of town gown riots’

Yours truly,
David Abrams ‘78

Dear Sir:

I would like to take this op-
portunity to comment on a cou-
ple of your recent articles. In
the first place I thought that
your editorial regarding ‘“‘rack
dates,’’ though sarcastic in
nature, displayed poor taste
and a sense of immaturity.
What disturbed me the most
was your pointed reference to
the girls from the surrounding
schools as ‘‘equestrian and
home-ec majors.’’ I have the
pleasure of attending RMWC
for two courses this term, so
surely you can classify me as
one of those so-called
equestrian majors. I’m sure
this will come as a big disap-
pointment to all of you, but I
have yet to encounter any of the
girls to whom you referred in
your editorial. The academic
quality of the school is every bit
as good as that of W&L’ If you
don’t believe me then why don’t
you accompany me to class
someday? Your remarks at-
tempt to show the superiority of
the W&L male, but in reality all
they display is sheer ignorance
and shoddy journalism.

Secondly, your article concer-
ning homecoming contained
several errors. Dr. Shillington
was not one of the judges as
reported in your article; his
duties pertained solely to the
crowning of the queen at the
football game. Dr. Hamer was
the judging whom you failed to
mention. Additionally, cocktails
did not precede the judge on
Friday afternoon. Rather, the
coctail party followed the judg-
“ng. Also, the judges did not
“examine”’ the girls at dinner,
since the judges were not even
present at dinner. Finally, the
judges did not ‘“‘interrogate’’
the girls; the atmosphere in
Fairfax Lounge did not in any
way resemble that of Devil’s
Island or Stalag 13’ Other than
the above corrections, your ar-
ticle was fairly accurate.

Sincerely,
Ed Wick, ‘78

Dear Editor:

During the past two weeks
there seems to be a ranging
firefight of opinions in this
editorial column. We have read
a carefree editorial on the
sophistaction of ‘“‘the W&L
gentlemen,’’ the up-
perclassman’s charisma, and
the socially uplifting ‘rack
date.’’ Then came a letter to the
editor steaming with hellfire
and brimstone which chastised
us for our ‘‘hypocritical
paradox’”’: we call ourselves
gentlemen yet we act like
animals. Both articles had a
particle of truth in them, yet
neither typifies the opinion of
the majority of W&L
gentlemen, which is difficult to
transcribe anyhow. All buts and
ifs aside, here is a poem which I
think apt:

The young monk walks the
streets,

Preaching true love needs no
body.

Look here upon Virgin Mary
so sweet,

For her body do not prostitute,
Says he,

She is beauty incarnated
within;

Soul so pure, mind so fine,

We have yet in 2000 years to
hear of her sin.”’

And there across the way a
man pines,

He looks upon the women walk-
ing to shops,

Desiring a body to love abed.
Never mind the soul,” thinks
he, licking his chops.

As he swears upon his phalic
head,

”’He’d never kick that gir] out of
bed.’’

Watching both self-saint and
animal,
Our gentleman
withal.

Perceiving love and what a
woman is,

Body and soul and yet more
must he and she give.

chuckles

‘“‘Preppie,’’ This term, once
used to designate only those
who were alumni of classy
private boarding schools, is now
the victim of flagrant overuse
by University students. Clearly,
we are in need of some new,
more specific terms. To help

 

out everyone, especially the

confused first year students,
I’ve divided the category
‘“‘Preppie”’ into several clearly
recognizable sub-types. So as
you walk around the Grounds,
see if you can pick out any of the
following:

Good-Looking Prep: (GLP):
You can’t imagine them dress-
ed any other way. Tall, lean,
and classically good-looking,
they look as if kahkis and
button-downs were designed ex-
pressly with them in mind.
Usually southern and charming
(love that accent,) G.L.P. guys
have been known to make even
the most vehement anti-prep
girls (usually northern and
freaky) sign. G.L.P. girls are

easy to spot — they’re the only.

ones who don’t look ridiciulous
wearing kilts and knee socks.
Look for G.L.P.’s everywhere
— they’re few and far between,
but they make it all worthwhile.

Middle of the Road Prep: The
keynote here is moderation, the
M.R.P.’s ‘‘prep out,”’ but never
to extremes. The guys usually
stick to Levi cords and Lacoste
shirts (with an occasional
three-stripe belt) and prefer
Wallabees to Topsiders. The
girls wear denim wrap-around

. skirts and striped sweaters, but
never paired with opaque tights

Prepping Out in Every Way

and L. L. Bean duckhunters.
(Would you?)

Hard Core Prep: These are
the true preppies, the ones who
actually went to prep school.
Don’t blame them for the way
they dress — the truth is they
just don’t know any better. How
to spot them? On guys, round
toroise shell glasses are a dead
giveaway. (Another
distinguishing characteristic of
H.C.P.’s are the guys who wear
seersucker suits and ties to foot-
ball games, and the girls who
don’t wear any makeup. Males
of this species are given to good
dancing, raunchy gatoring, and
consorting with Hollins girls.
Their female counterparts
sport cloth-covered headbands,
canvas handbags, and
espadrilles in twelve decorator
colors. (Warning: Female
H.C.P.’s find it physically im-
possible to go into Eljos without
spending a fortune. )

There are two subcategories
of Hard Core Prep which

whould be mentioned (and
avoided! ):
Tacky Prep: If someone

published a ‘‘Ten Worst Dress-
ed List’ at the University,
tacky preps would take top
honors. It’s not exactly what
they wear that’s tacky, it’s how
they wear it and what they wear
it with. Their oxford shirts are
always wrinkled, and their
baggy 1950’s vintage gray flan-
nel suits look slightly less at-
tractive than a potato sack. T.

_ P. girls go in for skirts paired

with (ugh!) hiking boots. It just
doesn’t make it. The second
subcategory of Hard Core Prep,
however, makes tacky prep

seem almost tolerable.
I’m referring, of course, to —

Obnoxious Prep: These are the
kind of preppies who give other

 

preppies a bad name. O.P.’s are
probably most noted for their
bizarre color combinations, the
most notorious being lime green
and hot pink.

Psuedo Prep: These are the
Northern public school kids
who, when first arrived at the
University, were so green they
thought ‘‘Lacoste’’ was
somehwere on the French
Riviera. But they soon saw the
haniwriting on the wall (or
shoid I say the monograms on
the sweaters?) and lost no time
in acquiring a preppie war-
drobe. Over Christmas vacation
they got a couple of crewneck
sweaters, and at Spring Break
maybe a pair or two of Monet
earrings. By the start of their
second year, they were full-
fledged ‘‘prep stars,’’ complete-
ly outfitted with kahkis, oxford
shirts, and if they were really
serious, topsiders.

Psuedo Preps are the ones
you see slinking in and out of El-
jo’s (the local ‘‘one-stop-Wahoo-
shop’’), camouflaging their pur-
chases in a plain brown wrap-
per. This is because, deep in-
side, the psuedo prep is a tor-
tured soul, torn between his or
her longing to ‘‘prep out” (it’s a
sickness, remember) and the
fear of his (still freaky) friends’
sarcastic comments. (’’You
prep star! Where ya headed, St.
A’s?’’)

Of course, the possible com-
binations which could result
from the very basic preppie
types I’ve listed above are
endless; Tacky-pseudo, Good-
looking-hard core, etc. etc. And
it’s entirely possible that I’ve
overlooked some sub-type com-
pletely. If so, I apologize and in-
vite you to add to this list via a
letter to the editor.

Letters to Editor

Dear Editor:

It seems to me to be a very
appropriate time to set the
record straight as to which
Mike Brown wrote the letter to
the Editor in last week’s Ring-
tum Phi. After suffering much
verbal abuse since this
notorious letter’s publication, I
wish to make it emphatically
clear that Mike Brown, transfer
student, Class of 1979, was not
the author of said letter. I
seriously considered changing
my name, but a letter to the
Editor, seemed to be the most
logical recourse.

In addition, I wish to state
without reservation, that I do
not share the Victorian opinions
held, by my eminent namesake,
Mr. Brown, Class of 1980, and
his’ illustrious co-signers. I
transferred to W&L, not’ only
for its ddademic excellence, but

also for the abundance’ of' hose —

queens which flock to this cam-
pus from such Shangri-las as
Hollins, Sweet Briar, and that
hose heayen, Southern Sem. In
fact, I was fortunate enough to
have one of these princesses as
my guest Homecoming
weekend,..She was my “rack
date.” I was her ‘‘rack
gentleman.” After all, aren’t
girls mere toys or playthings?
Shouldn’t we discard them
when we are through, much as
we would a six-year old Pen-
thouse Magazine? Gee’ Mom

Dear Editor:

Gee wnillikers! You’d think
I'd placed a big wet smacker on
the cheek of the writer of that
article, the way he befuddled
who did what to whom in that
little old somewhat hackneyed
autumn tradition of crowning
the queen. Also, I didn’t get no
dinner either. Schillington may
have. Shillington didn’t.
Because for years now, I
haven’t judged the queens. I
crown ‘em. So, I guess I don’t
need my head examined. At
least not for now.

The good job was done by that
merry fine band of judges Mrs.
Miller and Ms. Chappel, Pro-
fessors Dobbs, Hamer, and
Stephenson. (it’s Hamer he left
out) Me? I takes what I gets
and it was as nice as ever,
thanks to the judges. And if the
Ring-tum Phi hasn’t any good
pictures of me, I’ll be glad to
turn the other cheek for you.

Organically yours,
James K. Shillington,

Student comment:

Bookworms of the

World, Unite!

by Paul VanCott

Bookworms of the world
unite! For all too many
semesters we've allowed
ourselves to be cajoled, ridicul-
ed, and otherwise made fun of.
The time has come for the world
to realize that we have been
grinding the last eighteen years
for a reason, not just because
we enjoy being recluses. As a
group, we have been categoriz-
ed as robots, existing solely out
of love for the written word. As
individuals, we have been
ostracized as teacher’s pets,
pussies, and wimps. No longer
will we tolerate insults concern-
ing our sexual potency, no
longer will we be studying on
the night of the prom. OUr time

quartet, but again, C orey’s in-
terpretation was flawless. This
is a very singable piece with a
beautiful melody, a melody that
the guitarist brings out
marvelously (So much for the
idea that the guitar cannot
sing’). I particularly liked
this piece, but the concert was
such a complete success that it
is difficult to say that one work
is better than another.

As an overall judgment, the
guitar’s great advantage, it
seems to me, is its personal
quality. The ‘‘keys’’ strike the
strings on the piano not the
pianist, and the bow most of the
time accomplishes this on the
violin, but the guitarist is the
one who personally generates
the sound. It is a closeness that
is seemingly so responsible for

the appeal a good guitarist has
to the audience. Mr. Corey,
throughout his’ concert
| displayed this personal feeling
| for the guitar and this, coupled
| with his great technical ability,
| could only result in a great con-
cert. It did. No wonder Mr. Cor-
ey was the youngest performer
| ever to win the Concert Artists
| Guild Award. Judging from his
| performance Tuesday night, he
deserved it.

EC postpones

salary discussions

By a margin of eleven to
nothing, the Executive Commit-
tee voted last Monday night to
hold open hearings on the sub-
ject of publication board
salaries. Present student jour-
nalists receiving salaries are
Peter Goss, the business
manager of the Ring-tum Phi;
J. Michael Gallagher, editor-in-
chief of the Ring-tum Phi;
Temp Webber, head editor of
the Calyx; and possibly Grant
Leister, treasurer of the year-
book.

The salaries to the top jour-
nalists have aroused controver-
sy throughout the campus since
their inception. Last year, the
Executive Committee, under
the leadership of Law School
representative Rick Goddard,
changed its role from passive
Surveyor to a popular wat-
chdog. Goddard continues his
unceasing scrutiny of the
salaried students. Lashing out
against the idea of students
reaping profits from the rest of
the school, Goddard convinced
his colleagues to cut the RtP
budget from $3,000 to $2,500.

The newspaper, however, after
pointing out the fact that it had
cut the budget request from
$4,000 in 1976 to $3,000 a year
later, regained $4,000 of the
withheld funds. Another factor
in getting the funds back was
the apparent and imminent con-
traction of the newspaper to
eight pages if the Executive
Committee did not relent on its
cutbacks.

The open hearing scheduled
for Monday, October 24, will ac-
cumulate the views of concern-
ed students around the campus
on the ‘salary’ subject and will
gather these testimonies to
assist, in theory, the members
of the Executive Committee in
its decision. An anonymous
committeeman stated that
while the hearings may help
other members formulate their
final judgements, he has
definitely decided to oppose
salaries in any way, shape or
form. This member, however,
felt that granting credits to the
participants could very well be
a viable compromise.

the United States’ press system
he said. As these chains con-
tinue to grow, so will the con-
formity of ideas, he added.

Merrill asked the audience to
consider what has happened to
the press systems of some
Eastern European nations as an
example of what may happen to
American journalism. Merrill
blamed the growth of press
councils for the decrease of
pluralism of ideas.

‘In nations that once had ag-
gressive press systems such as
Great Britain and Sweden,
press councils have done much
to weaken them. Sweden used to
have an aggressive free press
until Swedish press councils
were introduced. Some people
still consider Sweden a great
place to live but the truth is: if
you want to live like a termite,
move to Sweden.”’

‘““Journalsim, unlike law and
medicine, was never meant to

| be a profession,” Merrill ex-
| plained. ‘Journalists should not
_ be requi‘ red to have a license
_ or a degree. Journalism is not a
profession, it is more of a craft
or a trade. Political Scientists,
‘sociologists and even people
'who don’t have college degrees
Should be allowed to become

journalists. Different
backgrounds are essential, as is
‘non-conformity.”’

' Sigma Delta Chi, the national-
ly known society of professional
journalists, has also been guilty
of decreasing idea diversity, ac-
cording to Merrill. Merrill pinn-
ed much of the blame on Casey
‘Buckgrove of the ‘Chicago
‘Tribune”’ for writing a list of
‘poorly written’ suggestions
for journalists to follow.

 “Buckgrove used to be the en-
vironmental editor for the
‘Tribune,’ Merrill stated. ‘“‘I
faced him once in a debate and I

 

practically killed him. Instead
of writing up suggestions for
journalists to follow, he still
should be writing about trash
and pollution—actually he still

The concept of a forced social
responsibility theory is, ac-
cording to Merrill, strikingly
similar to how previously free
nations have fallen under
totalitarian government. Mer-

clothes for one machine is nine
pounds. Putting more than this
amount into the machine can
damage it, Darrell said. After a
lot of people overload the
machines the motor belts start
stretching and this causes a loss
in drying power. According to
Darrell, this means that a
regular nine pound load would
take one or two extra cycles to
be completely dry. Hence in the
long run, putting more than
nine pounds of clothes into a
dryer to get your money’s worth
doesn’t pay off.

Darrell believes that a steer-
ing committee headed by the
newly elected freshman class
president could look into the
ways in which the service could
be improved. Among the ideas
he has is putting a scale into the
laundry room so students can
weigh their clothes so as not to
overload a machine. He also
suggests a new system of
security for the room. Darrell
cited an incident where a couple
of years ago a townie used one
of the washers to clean a dirty
rug for fear of ruining his
washing machine. He is confi-
dent that a new system of
security could be established by
this committee.

Darrell cited a lack of com-
munication between _ the
students and the system

operators for the problems con-
cering the washers and dryers.
He said that only during this
summer did he come to be in
charge of the service and stated
that he really didn’t have time
to look into the service until
recently.

Darrell also said that should
the new system work; two or
three more washers and dryers
could be added in the near
future’ He stated that it would
be betier to “first solve the ex-
isting problems and then ap-

by Paul VanCott

For all you lovers of Melville,
Emerson, and Thoreau there is
a new addition to your ranks at
Washington and Lee in the
perssonage of Dr. Robert P.
Fure. As a fledging member of
W&L’s English department,
Dr. Fure is teaching courses in
expository writing, introduc-
tory drama and poetry, as well
as in his specialty, American
Literature.

Born and raised
midwest, Dr.

in the
Fure attended
high school in suburban
Chicago. From there, he
journeyed nr-orthward to Nor-

thern Michigan University,
from whence he graduated in
1968. He did his subsequent
graduate work at Berkeley
University, where he earned a
Doctorate in English. For the
past four years Dr. Fure has
been teaching introductory
English courses at his graduate
school alma mater.

Luck, according to Dr. Fure,
brought him to Washington and
Lee. Although he applied to both
Cornell University and Col-
orado State for teaching posi-
tions, Dr. Fure was very pleas-
ed to accept a three year ap-
pointment to the W&L English
department. Dr. Fure cites the

excellent facilities, the equally
excellent faculty and the
politeness, dilligence, and
general positive outlook of the
students as decisive factors in
his decision to come to
Washington and Lee.

Dr. Fure finds the English
department both congenial and
diverse, providing him not only
with the encouragement to con-
tinue in his profession, but also
with the opportunity to further
his natural process of growth.
He views his role at Washington
and Lee as that of a student as
well as that of a teacher, and
consequently appreciates the
worth of a good English depart-
ment.

When asked to state his opi-
nions on the Honor System and
co-education at W&L, Dr.
Robert P. Fure did not hesitate
in being very candid. “The
Honor System,” according to
Dr. Fure, “‘is an intriguing ex-
periment” which he is ‘‘willing
to support” because he feels ‘‘a
great need for rededication to
the principles of honor.’’ More
specifically, in response to a
question concerning the in-
dividual scheduling of exams,
Dr. Fure maintained that an
honor system such as ours rests
upon a trust of the student in an
exam situation. As far as co-
education was concerned, Dr.
Fure recognized its disad-
vantages but had yet to see its
advantages. He elected to wait
until he had a more definte opi-
nion before he decided whether
an all-male enrollment was an
attribute or detriment to
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty.

While at W&L Dr. Fure in-
tends to author a book on the
famous American poet, William
Jenning Williams. He also
hopes to learn as much as possi-
ble about the southeast and its
people as possible, the city of
Lexington and Rockbridge
County notwithstanding. Most
importantly though, Dr. Fure
wants to teach a variety of sub-
jects, and through teaching con-
stantly learn and grow. He con-
cluded that “‘if there is any
disadvantage to the present ex-
perience...it’s that I don’t have
enough time to accomplish all
that I want to accomplish.”

The Ring-tum Phi takes this
opportunity to welcome Dr.
Robert P. Fure to Washington
and Lee, and to wish him good
luck here, and in all other future
enterprises.

ing of the Ring-tum Phi Fri-
