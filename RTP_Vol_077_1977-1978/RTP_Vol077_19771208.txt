Latest development: Pressure
brought on the City of Lexington
by the Ring-tum Phi has caused
Mayor Charles Phillips to order
the city attorney to draw up new
guidelines with respect to the
release of police information to
the press. These guidelines will
comply with the voluntary
guidelines set down by the
Virginia Press Association and
will go into effect today, Phillips
said.

City Attorney William O.
Roberts offered a Virginia At-
torney General’s opinion con-
cerning the maintenance of
records by law enforcement
agencies as the legal justifica-
tion for the Lexington Police
Department’s policy of refusing
to release the names of persons
arrested or issued court sum-
monses.

The March 2, 1976, opinion
discusses a_ statute which
charges sheriffs and chiefs of
police with the duty to ‘“main-

 

in Niain__certain records,” and

 

VOLUME LXXVII

specifies that those records are
exempt from the Freedom of In-
formation Act.

Roberts cited the Attorney
General’s opinion in response to
the Ring-tum Phi’s formal
challenge of the Police Depart-
ment’s policy of denying access
to the general public and press
information relating to arrest
records and summonses until
such time as they have been
entered on the court record.

J. Michael Gallagher, editor
of the Ring-tum Phi, said that
the Attorney General’s opinion
cited by Roberts was not “ap-
plicable”’ to the situation being
challenged. He explained that
by his interpretation of the opi-
nion, the records referred to are
“internal record,’’ such as in-
vestigative reports and ar-
resting officer’s reports.
“Those are not the arrest
records to which we feel we are
entitled access.”’

The Ring-tum Phi has refer-
red Attorney Roberts to two

other Attorney Generals’ opi-
nions. One opinion requires
“warrant”? and “‘arrest’’
records to be disclosed public-
ly; the other opens a sheriff’s
jail book to the public.

When confronted with a sum-
mary of a July 21, 1971, At-
torney General’s opinion from
the Civil Digest, which states
that ‘“‘warrant’”’ and “‘arrest”’
records are “official records
subject to disclosure re-
quirements,” Roberts said that
he would have to see the full opi-
nion. (The official opinion was
not available to theRing-tum
Phi.)

In the Attorney General’s jail
book opinion, such information
as name, color of eyes, age, sex,
charge and trail date—as in-
cluded in a county sheriff's jail
book—was viewed as part of an
“official record’? and was,
therefore, covered under the re-
quirement for public disclosure
by the Freedom of Information
Act.

NUMBER 12

New law threatens campus music

by Galen Trussell

A new copyright law to take
effect the beginning of next
year threatens to stifle all
musical entertainment at
Washington and Lee.

The new law will require col-
leges and universities to pay
royalties for any source of
music played on their campus.
The royalty payments would in-
clude fraternity combo parties,
and any musical entertainment
the Student Acitvities Board or
the Cockpit could provide.

As a result of this new law,
University Center Director,
Mike Cappeto suggested that all
organizations involved in book-
ing musical acts refrain from
doing so until the beginning of
next year. Cappeto said that
W&L can only wait and see
what developes, and thereby
avoid being one of the early test
cases for the new law. Cappeto
suggested that there would be a
large number of test cases with
the larger universities before a
clear rule for university enter-
tainment is adopted by the
various copyright companies.

According to Gary English,
executive director of the Na-
tional Entertainment and Cam-
pus Activities Association, the
effect of the new law could be
devastating, and _ royalty
payments could total up to half
of the college’s entertainment
budgets. He added that a lot of
musicians would be losing work
because of the law and that a lot
of concert schedules would have
to be revamped.

The alternatives to paying the
royalty fee are singularly unat-
tractive. If a college allows an

unlicensed performer to play on

-its campus without paying the

fees it can be subject to court
action and fines. Each time a
piece of music is performed in
public without the permission of
the copyright holder the college
is subject to a $250 fine. The on-
ly other alternative to not pay-
ing a fee or a fine would be for
the schools to hire performers
who perform only older classics
for which the 75 year copyright
has expired.

Almost all royalty fees for
performers are collected by

three royalty companies here in
the U. S. These companies are
The American Society of Com-
posers, Authors, and Publishers
(ASCAP), Broadcast Music In-
corporated (BMI) and SESAC
Inc. BMI has suggested a
blanket license for colleges that
would cover all musical enter-
tainment except big concerts.
The rate BMI mentioned was 10
cents per student per year to be
paid to all three of the royalty
agencies. If this plan were
adopted it would mean an addi-

Contact loses *590;

EC vote unanimous

by Lee Howard

Approximately $590 was
taken away from Contact and

Committee funding account on
a unanimous vote by the EC
Monday night.

Also, it was revealed at the
meeting that the Music Union
has used all but $467 of the

which has cost the Union about
$1,400, according to SAB co-

City responds to RtP complaints

Roberts said that the sheriff’s
jail book does not apply to Lex-
ington Police Chief James A.
Kirby’s jurisdiction, since the
sheriff is part of the county’s
government. Roberts explained
that if a person is arrested by
the city police, he is in-
carcerated in the county jail,
which is outside of Kirby’s
jurisdiction.

In response, City Counsel
Roberts cited an Attorney
General’s opinion pertaining to
records maintained by chiefs of
police. The opinion is in
reference to Section 15.1-135.1, a
statute which charges police
chiefs with the duty to protect
and preserve all records they
are required to gather under
law

Specifically, ‘‘arrest
records” and “investigative
records” are defined in the opi-
nion as “public records.’’ The
opinion reads in part: “Such
records, however, apart from

tention that Roberts is applying
the statute’s definition of ‘‘ar-
rest recor
that ‘‘any exception or exemp-
tion from applicability’ should
be “narrowly construed,” as
provided in the Freedom of In-
formation Act. The newspaper
also asserts that the Attorney
General’s opinions it cites, sup-
port its position for immediate
disclosure of names and ‘‘other
brief factual background” of
those persons arrested or issued
summonses.

“The law is given an aura
that disguises its real purpose.
It does its dirty work day in and
day out,” William Kunstler,
nationally-famous defense
lawyer said Thursday at Lee
Chapel.

William Kunstler has become
prominent by making a career
of defending the so-called
revolutionaries of American
society. His lecture on the
dangers of the legal system was
part of the Contact ‘78 Sym-
posium.

Dressed in a fashinable three-
piece suit, Kunstler looked
every bit like a highly-paid
lawyer from an_ established
firm in New York City. But
Kunstler’s legal battles take
him far from New York, and his
clients are not the type that can
afford large fees.

to SAB records. He also said the
Union had not been keeping
receipts regularly. He added

«Kunstler’s life and professional
outlook took a new course from
that moment on.

Since then some of his cases
have had him as a negotiator
for the Sioux Indians at Wound-
ed Knee, S. D., representing
prisoners at the Attica upris-
ings in 1971 and representing
students at the Kent State

shootings of 1970.

“I’ve learned a lot about the
legal profession,”’ he said, “I
fear, distrust and hate the law,
but I understand what it is and
what it does.”’

Quoting from Charles Reich’s
“The Greening of America,”
Kunstler referred to the law as
“the control mechanism of the
corporate state.’’ The society
creates a mechanism to deal
with the individuals society
fears most, he said. These in-
dividuals are called ‘‘revolu-
tionaries,” and every genera-
tion has them.

“These so-called revolu-
tionaries are being screwed by
the legal system, and I try to do
my part to help them fight
back,”’ he said.

The way that the system con-
trols these revolutionaries is by
the political trial. Kunstler said
that the trial of Jesus was a
perfect example of a successful
political trial. He was a revolu-
tionary who threatened the
system. The system responded
by getting rid of the revolu-
tionary voice and frightening
his followers. The final phase of
the political trial is to unite the
silent majority against the
revolutionary.

The peace movement of
1965-1972 was a time when the
government attempted to use
political trials to subvert the
ideas of the revolutionaries that
were protesting the war,

Catalogue scholarships

After careful reading of the
Washington and Lee catalogue
and Student Handbook by
members of the staff at the Ring-
tum Phi, we've determined that a
study into whether or not many of
the student organizations includ-
ed in these publications are ac-
tually viable and effective, or
merely just resume fillers for
future job applications.

by Ken Mastilli

Ever wonder who gets all
those scholarships listed in the
back of your catalogue? The
Phi asked Financial Aid direc-
tor Van H. Pate and here’s what
hehadtosay: —

“T’d like to have that listing of
endowments and scholarships
taken out of the catalogue
because it’s misleading,’ said
Van H. Pate last week in a Ring-
tum Phi interview.

Pate, who is financial aid
director at W&L, said that
many prospective students call
him up and ask how to apply for
the scholarships listed in the
back of the catalogue, only to
find that there’s no application
needed.

“Except for a very few, all

U.C. votes

by Randy Smith
The University Council voted
overwhelmingly, last Thurs-
day, to recommend to the
Mathematics Department that
a pre-calculus course not be of-
fered at Washington and Lee.

The recommendation came
after almost an hour of wide-
ranging debate about the nature
of ‘“‘pre-calculus”’ courses and
their purpose in the curriculum.

Dean Lewis G. John, co-
chairman of the U.C., gave a
brief background summary of
the pre-calculus controversy,
and paraphrased Dr. Edgar W.
Spencer’s position. Dr. Spencer,
a professor in the Geology
Department, maintains that a
pre-calculus course might be
helpful for students not major-
ing in mathematics, who need a
sounder basis before taking
Math 101. (Calculus is the
lowest level math course of-
fered at W&L.)

Dr. R. S. Johnson, head of the
Mathematics Department, of-
fered a two-page memoranda
expressing his Department’s
position. Dr. Johnson said, “I
can’t define what pre-calculus

back of the catalogue are
distributed on the basis of finan-
cial need,” Pate explained.
“Those scholarship monies are
pooled together and are the
total source of funds for all
grants given by the University
committee on financial aid, he
said.

According to Pate, the com-
mittee sometimes gives out
more than is bequeathed by the
donors. ‘‘But what is important
is that all the money is spent,”’
said Pate. “Even if there is not
someone that meets the specific
requirements of the scholar-
ship, we still give out the money
in the form of financial aid to so-
meone. For instance, we have a
pre-ministerial scholarship to
help other students,” said Pate.

Pate noted that the best part
about the scholarship fund is
that it makes possible for W&L
to avoid having to take money
from its operating expenses to

pay for financial aid.
“Therefore, in theory and in
practice,” said Pate, ‘‘the

money that one student pays for
his tuition is never used to pay
for another student’s tuition.
When asked about the fact
that many of the scholarships
listed specify a preference to a

misleading

worthy student from a par-
ticular state, Pate said that the
Financial Aid Committee might
give a student from Virginia
part of the Bathe county
scholarship for worthy students
from that area if he is eligible.

Scholarship recipients are no
longer listed in the catalogue or
in the back of graduation pro-
grams because of the Buckley
Act which insures the privacy of
school records, and personal
discretion on the part of the
Financial Aid Committee. “We
thought by publishing the
names we were infringing upon
the privacy of the individual in-
volved, infringements which
are not allowed under the provi-
sion of the Buckley privacy
act,” said Pate.

Pate said he has been pushing
for years to stop publication of
scholarship recipients’ names
because, as he put it, ‘‘the whole
school doesn’t need to know who
is on financial aid, at least
publicly.”

Pate agreed that since the
scholarships are not awarded
as stated in the catalogue, they
should be taken out and in their
place a statement should be in-
serted describing how the
money is actually distributed.

down pre-calc course

is,’ and noted that there is no
agreement on what such a
course should cover. The Math
Department feels that students
entering Washington and Lee
have had enough mathematics
to move onto calculus.

The proposal was made that a
pre-calculus course be offered
as a means of encouraging
“arts” students to try math.
But the question was raised as
to the purpose such a course
would serve: ‘‘Are we asking
the Mathematics Department
to offer a non-math course?”’

Dr. Johnson countered with
results of “various” studies
which show that most pre-
calculus students do not move
on to more advanced math
courses.

These results prompted the
suggestion for a ‘connected
course,” tying a pre-calculus to
a calculus course in order to get
any credits. The suggestion was

also made for a “‘workbook”’ to
be compiled by the Math
Department to provide in-

terested students with the
mathematical rudiments for
calculus. Dr. Johnson stated
that such a ‘‘workbook’’
already existed.

After approximately an
hour’s worth of discussion, a
motion was made to recom-
mend to the Mathematics
Department that a pre-calculus
course not be offered. The mo-
tion passed 19-0, with 3 absten-
tions.

Arguments were made for a
more unified faculty policy in
regard to independent Ex-
aminations. Specifically,
discussion centered on the wide
variance of exam administra-
tion by the faculty and the con-
fusion it causes.

Discussion of Professor W. L.
Sessions’ motion to limit U.C.
meetings was tabled until the
next session on Thursday,

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Christmas Candlelight
Service will take place today in
the Robert E. Lee Memorial
Episcopal Church.

The service, nine lessons with
carols, is an ancient form of ser-
vice for corporate worship at
Christmas time. The series of
lessons tells the story of sacred
history from the Creation of
Man to the Incarnation.

It was first revived for
modern use at Truro in Corn-
wall during the 19th century. It
is broadcast each year from
King’s College Chapel in Cam-
bridge and is widely used both
in England and the United
States.

The carols will be sung by the]
Washington and Lee Glee Club,
under the direction of Dr. Gor-
don Spice, and the Mary
Baldwin Choir, directed by Gor-
don Page. The organist will be
James Tucker Cook.

The lessons will be read by
members of the W&L com-
munity, including Pamela
Simpson, Gregory C. Sieminski,
William Lad Sessions, Andrew
W. McThenia, Edward Craun,
John M. Gunn Jr., Andrew H.
Bishop IV, Lewis G. John, and

In your pit:

Dave Van Ronk tonight!

by Galen Trussell

Go see Dave Van Ronk.

If you never see another act in
the Cockpit you should see Van
Ronk for the simple reason that
he is the best entertainment
that the Cockpit will feature this
year.

There will be two shows
tonight, and there will be no
cover charge for students who
have paid their activities fee.

A class entertainer deserves
a class audience. Please come
to listen not to be rowdy. People
who are rowdy or obnoxious in
the Cockpit in the future will be
subject to punishment by the
Student Control Committee.

Van Ronk comes to us direct
from an engagement at the
Cellar Door in D. C. He per-
formed in Washington earlier
this year.The Washington Post
had this to say about him: ‘‘Van
Ronk is irrepresible, a one-of-a-
kind performer who shows no
signs of running out of steam.”
Rolling Stone credits Van Ronk
for ‘‘almost single-handedly in-
troducing rural blues to the folk
movement.’’Rolling Stone also
calls Van Ronk one of the most
influential blues performers of
his generation. Musicans News
says “Dave Van Ronk has
always had the voice nobody
can challenge.’’ Advocate
magazine-wrote that Van
Ronk’s guitar picking is “‘as ac-
coustic as can be, clear and
relaxed, like slow bubbling spr-
ing water.’’ Lastly, Previewer

THE NOSE KNOWS

With the end of the semester
approaching we feel its time for
a wrap-up.

The SAB had a_ good
semester, with all the scandal
everyone came clean. The
Music Union came very clean.
Anyone that can spend their en-
tire budget in one and a half
months deserves some credit.
The SAB As You Like It was a
farce, playing to a crowd of only
100 is not easy. Certain
members of the English
Department were there. After
doing some heavy petting with
their lady friends (for which
they got nasty looks from Dean
Diddle) they decided to leave at
intermission.

A certain admissions person
was there trying to enculturate
her children as well as her PhD.
husband. This was quite a
switch considering she had
them hawking programs at last
years lacrosse games. Speaking
of lacrosse did you know you
have to be invited to go out for
lacrosse? That’s funny I
though sports were open to
anyone who was qualified. Prof.
Latture was at As You Like It,
just like he’s at everything.
How does he do it? Some say
there’s more than one of him.

We heard an interesting story
about him. It seems that when it
came time to build the new
library the access to the back
campus (Howe, duPont and
Parmly) was going to be closed
the big ‘‘H’’ called VMI and ask-
ed permission to build an access
road behind the Marshall
Library to Howe Hall. VMI said
‘“‘No way!’’ Such a small favor,
but no way. The university was
at a loss. Parsons started grow-
ing a beard. Prof. Latture step-
ped in and said he remembered
back in 1919 (I believe) W&L
built Letcher Ave. Sure enough
when the university checked

their records, they found out
they owned Letcher Ave.! The
big “H” called VMI and said
something to the effect that the
next person who stepped on Let-
cher Ave. was gonna get a taste
of W&L ROTC. Isn’t it a nice
road we have behind VMI?

Carole C. made her first ap-
pearance at an EC meeting. She
was wearing a coordinating out-
fit with our little friend. Jerry
D. was there also, but without
the Emmers, McFaddens,
Kozaks and Joneses. (A first—
Julia must of missed that). Dan
Scott was there trying to defend
his coup. I thought students
were supposed to be running
things (i.e. Galen T.).

A certain dorm counselor
leaves us. No one will notice
since he can recite the TV paper
word for word.

A certain Phi Kapp from
Wisconsin sent the Phi his
Christmas list just in case
anyone is interested.

There’s word the pitter patter
of little feet will be heard
around Washington Hall in
several months.

Sponsored by the Student Ac-
tivities Board, Washington and
Lee received a visit from the
National Shakespeare Com-
pany last Sunday night. This
group is on tour 9 months out of
every ear, bringing live
Shakespearian performances
into areas which normally
would not experience them.
Their last performance was in
1974, when the same comedy
was presented. And, in spite of
the all too near exam drive,
over 150 souls ventured into the
night air, for what many hoped
would be an enjoyable return to
the great bard’s works.

Unfortunately, it is here—in
the word ‘‘return’’—that the
company seemed to have its ,
greatest flaw, at least in the
minds of Sunday night’s au-
dience. The Company’s sworn
duty seems to be that of
popularizing Shakespeare, and
as a result, they attempt to
make him ‘‘relevant’’ to
modern times. Evidently, most
of their work is done with au-
diences who have been brain-
washed into thinking that
Shakespeare, because he is of
classic repute, is also ‘‘dull.”’
And, in trying to fend off that
boring reputation, they
transform the play into a
burlesqe variation on
Shakespeare!

This may work very well in
breaking in new followers of
Shakespeare, but those people
who took the trouble on this 4
campus to see the show already 3
had some exposure and ap- *
preciation for the genuine thing. 2
In short, we didn,t need to be %
“sold” atall. a

So one should view this per=
formance by realizing that the '
Company was taking great
liberties with the
Shakespearian script, in order
to entice the laughter that no
doubt greeted the original in
1600. In this respect, they
succeeded—a limited success
certainly, but a success all the
same. And only those . un- _
fortunates who have known the

  

beauty of the play in its original
state have a right to be
disgruntled and somewhat let-
down.

In spite of their free style,
though, the group is immensely
talented and personable. Even
Richard Phillips, who played
both the good and bad Dukes
(the former as a poor man’s
Burl Ives; the latter vaguely
reminiscent of Mayor Daley in
his declining years) won the
sympathy of the generally
young audience. Certain inter-
changes were very memorable.
Rodney Clark’s ‘‘All the world’s
a Stage’’ soliloquy was perform-
ed with a wonderful balance of
delicacy and irony. And Alison
Edwards as Rosalind deserves

special plaudits as | the

headstrong heroine.

As You Like It is a strangely
apt title for the type of presenta-
tion viewed last Sunday. For
truly, if you could accept the
Forest of Arden as a refuge for
latter-day flower children, and
a disco number instead of the
usual Elizabethan wedding
dance which closes the show,
you should have enjoyed it. The
SAB certainly deserves thanks
for bringing a live theatre per-
formance to W&L free of
charge. And, for those who were
truly offended by the show,
keep in mind how easily you
really did escape; this Com-
pany also does Taming of the
Shrew in orange wigs and: on
motorcycles, we hear...

Flat Generals manage to
roll over Rochester, 89-71

by Ken Mastrilli

Despite 28 turnovers and a
sluggish, error-filled first half,
the W&L Generals defeated the
University of Rochester Yellow
Jackets 89-71 in basketball ac-
tion Wednesday night at
Warner Center.

W&L wrestler pin defeat
on Lynchburg, Madison

The Wrestling Generals got
their season off to a fine start
this weekend, performing ad-
mirably in the second annual
Washington and Lee Invita-
tional on December 3, while
crushing conference rival Lyn-
chburg 34-3 on November 30,
and winning a closely contested
match against James Madison
University this past Tuesday,
20-16.

The winning week began
when the Generals traveled to
Lynchburg to begin the defense
of their ODAC crown. In a lop-
sided match W&L came out vic-
torious in nine of the ten weight
divisions, losing only a close
match at 167 lbs. The Generals
were led by tri-captain Ed
Rogers(150) and junior Jim
Flippen(158), both of whom
registered pins, and senior
heavyweight Ollie Mowry who
posted a convincing 10-1 ver-
dict.

“Ollie sure looked good
tonight,” said a jubilant Rogers
following the match.’ If we get
efforts such as that from him all
year this will be one tough
wrestling team.”’

This past Saturday the
Generals hosted their second
annual invitational, placing an
impressive fourth place finish,
up a notch from last year. Again
it was Rogers who teamed up
with sophomore Ray Gross(142)
to led the team, being the only

two Generals to take home first

place hardware.

The third seeded Rogers had
a relatively easy time of it . win-
ning all three of his matches by
a combined score of 35-6, in-
cluding an amazing 12-0 victory
over Liberty Baptist’s William
Brooks in the finals. Gross, who
entered the tournament as the
third seed at 142, had a rougher
time than the Generals’ highly
touted captain, although the
results were the same. After
beating his first round opponent
2-1, Ray found himself trailing
by three points in the second
round when he neatly took down
his man and registered a quick
pin. Then in the finals he won a
narrow 6-5 decision over Stu
Freeman of York College. The
match was not as close as the
score indicates, as Ray gave
away two points in the end to in-
sure his victory.

Freshman Dave Stoeffel also
put on an impressive showing
for the Generals at 167 lbs.,
placing third in the tournament
while registering the first two
victories of his varsity carreer.
The tournament was won by a
strong Clemson team, coached
by two time NCAA champion
Wade Schalles, who was follow-
ed by York, George Mason,
Washington and Lee, last year’s
champion, Liberty Baptist,
VMI, Maryville, and James
Madison.

Against Madison, the
Generals benefitted greatly
from two victories thanks to a

W&L torpedoes
VMI swimmers

by Jim Barnes

W&L swimmers captured ten
out of twelve possible first
places and crushed VMI last
Tuesday, 64-49. The Generals’
victory was highlighted by
several record breaking efforts,
particularly those of Peter
Meem.

Meem turned in a career high
on his leg of the medley relay
and propelled his relay team-
mates, Howard Pillsbury, Scott
Duff and Bob Newcomb, to a
first place finish with a 34:07
time.

_  Meem also captured two in-
dividual firsts. He came within
a hundredth of a second of set-
ting a school record, but his
2:07.21 was good enough for a
first in the 200 yd. individual
medley. Meem turned in an ex-
cellent time in the 200 yd. breast
stroke for another first.

Chip Hoke also had a good
evening at VMI as he took two
first places. He won the 200 yd.
backstroke, and swam the 1000
yd. freestyle in 10:23, a pool

record at VMI.

W&L had only one entry in
the 200 yd. freestyle, but that
was all the Generals needed for
a first place finish, as Romich
finished in 1:48.8. He also finish-
ed second to VMI’s Cafferill in
the 100 yd. freestyle. Cafferill
edged Newcomb for VMI’s only
other first place finish in the 50
yd. freestyle.

General John Hudson clipped
4: 48.3 in the 500 yd. freestyle for
a first place, and the third best
finish for that event in Division
III this year. Drew Pillsbury
clocked a 2:10.8 200 yd. butterf-
ly for yet another W&L first.

In the diving competition
freshmen Jay Diesing and
George Irvine placed first and
second respectively in both the
one meter and three meter div-
ing co etition. Coach Bill
Stearns was pressed to
remember the last time two
W&L divers had accomplished
that feat. Stearns commented
that Meem ‘“‘probably had the
best day swimming of his life.’’

In what was an obvious let-
down after the Generals’
sparkling victory over Lyn-
chburg College Saturday night,
W&L’s roundballers blew leads
of 10 and 15 points during the
first half, while giving up the
ball 20 times and were only
ahead 35-32 over a team which
started four freshmen and a
junior.

The second half saw the
Generals come out and score 53
points, but their defense still
left a lot to be desired. The ex-
ception was Dave Luenig, who
played exceptionally at both
ends of the court. He along with
Pat Dennis shared the high
scoring honors with 18 points
apiece.

Mike Wenke, despite dishing

out 14 assists and scoring 17
points, had problems handling
the ball throughout the first
half.

Long jump shots by All-
American candidate Dennis
along with consistent shooting
by Larry Meyers got the
Generals off to a 23-8 lead over
the hapless Yellow Jackets who
appeared to have problems just
holding on to the ball. But tur-
novers led to 10 straight
unanswered points. by
Rochester, eight by the Yellow
Jackets’ Ryan Russell who end-
ed up as the game’s leading
scorer with 22. This kept the in-
domitable men from upstate
New York close at the half. .

The fact that they were still
close at the half prompted
Rochester coach and. former
W&L basketball star Mike Neer
to characterize his team’s ef-
forts as its best of the year. ‘‘Of
course the refereeing didn’t
help us,” he said, referring to
the crucial third quarter when
he was slapped with two two-
shot technical fouls at the same
time.

After Wenke sank the four
free throws the Generals got the
ball out of bounds and -im-
mediately put it in the hoop for
a six point play.

Wenke’s alley-oop pass to the
sky-high Bruce Williams under
(or should I say over) the
basket sealed the Yellow
Jackets’ fate, as the Generals’
lead ballooned to 17 points with
5:47 left in the game.

The Yellow Jackets hustling,
but inept, play was very much
in contrast to the lethargic play
of the Generals. Coach Can-
field, ever the optimist, had a
very different outlook on the
game. ‘‘When you can turn the

This week the Phi has ac-
quired the services of a former
local bookmaker who nearly
went into bankruptcy two years
ago for taking too many bets.
His name_ shall _ remain
anonymous because his
enemies are still looking for
him. Today, he will preview this
weekend’s big game in the ‘Na-
tional Football League. If his
predictions turn out to be
wrong, you’ll see why bookmak-
ing almost proved to be a fatal
occupation for him.

Detroit (5-7) at Baltimore
(9-2): The Lions have not won
on the road this year, losing six
straight. The Colts will win
their sixth straight at home
because they have to win in
order to stay tied with Miami in
the AFC East. Also, Bert Jones
will get a golden opportunity to
burn the Lions with many
touchdown passes because
Detroit habitually blitzes at the
wrong time. Loof for Baltimore
to breeze by 31-14.

Green Bay (3-9) at Chicago
(7-5): The Bears have a golden
opportunity to make the
playoffs for the first time since
they beat the Giants 14-10 for
the NFL championship in 1963.
The Bears won’t blow this one

 

against the low-scoring Packers
even if George “Papa Bear’
Halas has to leave his warm sky
suite to inspire the team on the
sidelines like he did in the old
days. The Bears will not win
easily though because most
games in the black and blue
division are tight struggles.
Walter Payton may run for 250
yards but the Bears will only
win by 17-13. Take the Packers
and the points if you care to bet.

Atlanta (6-6) at Los Angeles
(9-3): The Falcons can only
keep their slim wild-card hopes
alive by winning their last two
games. The Rams want to win
because they want to go for the
home field advantage in the
playoffs. Last week the Rams
managed to defeat defending
Super Bow] champion Oakland
at home to clinch the NFC West
title. -Los Angeles will rest
many regulars but will still
show enough firepower to
defeat Atlanta as the Falcons
will endure their thirteenth
defensive struggle of the
season. Rams 13-3.

Minnesota (8-4) at Oakland
(9-3): The Raiders will come
out smoking here after unex-
pectingly losing to the Rams in

the closing minutes last week,

Phi at “odds” with Greek

Oakland can practically score
at will here as long as Kenny
Stabler is quarterback. The
Vikings were lucky to win last
week against San Francisco
and are in store for a long after-
noon this Sunday. All the
Raiders have to do is win their
last two games to be the wild-
card team in the AFC. The Vik-
ings will help this cause by a
score of 35-10. Give the points
and take the Raiders.

Miami (9-3) at New England
(8-4): The Patriots can win the
AFC East by defeating both the
Dolphins and the Colts in their
last two games. The Dolphins
have too much momentum on
their side and should win by a
touchdown. The Patriots at
times have played uninspired
football this year for
mysterious reasons. How could
they have possibly lost to Buf-
falo at home? That game could
have easily been fixed by the
underworld. Dolphins 20-13.

Pittsburgh (8-4) at Cincinnati
(7-5): The Bengals are one of
the hottest teams in pro football
having won their last three in-
cluding a victory over Miami,
The Steelers only have to lose
this game by less than six and

Defense awakens as cagers
startle Hornet by 24 pts.

by Mark Mitchell

The Generals outscored Lyn-
chburg 22 to 6 midway through
the second half to route the
Hornets 93-69 Saturday night.

Oddly, enough, the second
half started with the Hornets
appearing to have the ad-
vantage. They were down by
one point (35 to 34), but they had
_ the momentum since W&L had
blown a seven point lead. Fur-
thermore, two Generals
starters, center Ardith Collins
and power forward Larry
Meyer, did not start the second
half because they were in foul
trouble.

However, the Generals’
bench responded magnificient-
ly. Back-up center Bob Smither-
man was 6 for 6 from the field,
and Bruce Williams performed
excellently to allow. the

Benefitrun cancelled

by Mark W. Danos

Fate seemed to have had it in
for the WLUR-Cross Country
team 24 Hour Relay.

The event which was to take
place on November 18 was
cancelled due to a lack of run-
ners. Injuries to the W&L cross
country team coupled with the
cancellation of Bridgewater
College was the beginning of the
end.

Al Weeks, team co-captain
was among the primary in-
juries with a bad toe. However
the team lacked enthusiasm
about the event, according to
Bill Welch, the other team co-
captain.

The cancellation was not all
bad for according to Mike
Lavitt, WLUR station manager,
it was a bad time of the year for
sponsors. The relay was on the
coattails of both the United
Fund and the Jaycees annual
fund drives.

These fund raising activities
also coincided with the mer-
chants outlay for Christmas

Generals to get 71 per cent
shooting from their bench.

The defense also responded
well.

The Generals played defense
with the most intensity they
have had all year, allowing only
ten points in the first twelve
minutes of the second half. Most
of the game, the Hornets stood
around on offense and exhibited
poor shot selection. Their in-
ability to run their offense
resulted in them being out-
rebounded 49-38, and out shot
57.4 to 35.7 per cent by the
shorter, but more patient
Generals.

Collins and Smitherman did a
good job of fronting All-ODAC
pivotman E. D. Schechterly.
But even when Schechterly got
the ball, Leunig, who shut down
his man, was there to help out.

stock. Since it was late October
to early November the mer-
chants had not yet begun to
receive their Christmas sales.

Lavitt did insist that the drive
to obtain sponsors was going
“fairly well’’ and that the event
would have ‘“‘come off” had it
not been for the team injuries
and cancellations.

They will however try again
probably the first weekend in
March, says Lavitt.

Wenke and Forlenza totally
outplayed Lynchburg’s point
guard Tom Selinger. While
Wenke and Forlenza combined
for thirteen points, Selinger was
0-5 from the field for no points.
Indeed, Selinger’s offensive
contribution for the evening
came in the form of an offensive
foul in the first half.

Pat Dennis, who led the
Generals with twenty points,
held his man, All-ODAC guard
Wayne Davis, to ten points.

In short, the victory put the
Generals on top of the ODAC
and restored what confidence
the Generals may have lost
after their humiliating loss to
York. At times, the Generals
showed how good they could be,
pressuring the ball defensively,
moving the ball well offensively
and attacking the offensive
boards. Now everyone knows
that this year’s team can be bet-
ter than last year’s. Larry
Meyer has impressed fans with
his steady play, offensive re-
bounding and high percentage
shooting at the strong forward
position. Ardith Collins seems
to have improved 100 per cent
over last year and his backup,
Bob Smitherman, has awesome
potential. The bench led by
Forlenza and Williams has been
the team’s strength. Returning
starters Wenke, Dennis, and
Leunig have improved. Thus,
this year’s Generals will be
disappointed if they fail to do
better than last year’s team.

than a minute over their op-
ponents. In addition the
Generals got one point victories
from Mowry and sophomore
Mike Deighen. Captains Knipp
and Rogers also won decisions
as the Generals extended their
dual meet record to 2-0.

“A big win,” said coach
Franke as he savored a victory
win. “I think the way we wrestl-
ed tonight is the way only cham-
pionship teams know how to

wrestle.”’

And with two wins in their
first two meets, the Generals
appear to be the team to beat in
the ODAC.

A busy week behind them, the
Generals now take a break
returning to action on January
13 and 14 with matches against
Campbell College and Duke
University. The next home
match will be February 7
against Hampden-Sydney.

The Bengals will upset the
Steelers by 20-17 but expect the
Steelers to rebound next Sunday
to beat San Diego and win their
sixth straight division title.

Washington (7-5) at St. Louis
(7-5): Neither one of these up
and down teams deserves to
make the playoffs but the win-
ner of this Saturday’s battle has
a chance of being the NFC wild-
card representative. St. Louis
has an excellent chance
because a tie at 9-5 with the
Bears could put the Cards in the
playoffs because they defeated

Chicago 16-13 earlier this
season. Also, the Cards’ last
game is against the soon-to-be 0
for 27 Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
The Redskins are at a disad-
vantage because a tie with
Chicago would prove fatal
because of the best average
point differential applying to
conference games, whatever
that means. The Cardinals
defense is bad enough so the
Redskins can score at least two
touchdowns. The Redskins will
upset St. Louis by 17-14 to pro-
bably hand a playoff berth to an
unlikely candidate, the Chicago
Bears.

Ardith Collins controlled the
boards with 11 rebounds, but
early foul trouble and erratic
shooting made him ineffective
offensively. Defensively the
Generals were reaching and
grabbing instead of getting
position as evidenced by the
fact that the Yellow Jackets
were at the charity line most of
the evening.

Depending on sheer talent
alone the Generals showed they
can win even when they play
badly. But Canfield’s cohorts

you can bet your Christmas

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Exam Week

With exams just a few days away and with the
pressure of knowing you don’t know the material, it is

difficult to think about any other earth-shattering pro-:

blems. The world of Washington and Lee seems to
slow down considerably when the end of a term comes
rolling around.

At times, the slow pace of exam week can get to you
more than the pressure of studying for your hardest
exam. It can be agonizing to wait from the time you
take your first exam, to the time you take your next
exam, to the time you take your very final exam.
There is nowhere to release this agony either. The
frats don’t party, the SAB hasn’t any movies schedul-
ed, sports take a break, and the Cockpit reverts back
to the way it used to be before it took on its ‘“‘pub”’ at-
mosphere. About the only thing left are the ‘“‘BV”’
class skin flicks which don’t really relieve frustra-
tions but only add to it.

Hopefully there will be no honor violations this ex-
am period. Competition during this time of year is in-
tense. The pressure of exams put an enormous strain
on the student to live by and uphold the honor system.
Passing or failing, graduation, getting a good job, ac-
ceptance to graduate school are all important
thoughts going through our minds now. To risk it all
by violating the honor code out of fear of failure is
foolish. A passing grade at the expense of one’s honor
is cheaply bought. The maintenance of one’s honor,
clear conscious and self respect are infinitely more
important in the long run.

But this is nothing to dwell on. More than likely,
every student will act honorably during exams. No
violations should occur. There are other issues this
column should approach and discuss, but because of a
lack of time to devote to serious thought of these
issues, they will not be adequately covered now. They
will be raised though for you to consider over the
Christmas break and to give you something else to
think about during the exam period besides your sub-
jects.

Should the U.S, be interferring in the Middle East
when Egypt and Israel seem to be doing fine on their
own?

Will the Cockpit be able to continue to provide the
campus with an entertainment alternative?

Will you be invited to the next Contact party?

Will the Ring-tum Phi be identifiable as an eight
page or twelve page paper and will the editor and
business manager speak to each other next term?

Good luck with exams. Have a happy holiday break.

“Bush” Parking

Regulated

Dear Editor:

I am writing at the request of
members of your student body
in an attempt to clarify the
policies on curfews, parking
and towing of automobiles on
the Sweet Briar College cam-
pus.

Male guests unless they are
properly registered to stay
overnight in our hostel or other
approved on campus locations
are expected to leave the cam-
pus by 12:45 a.m. (Sunday-
Thursday) and 3:45 a.m. (Fri-
day and Saturday) ; these hours
are forty-five minutes past the
conclusion of our daily visita-
tion hours and are actually ear-
ly morning of the following day.
An exception to this policy oc-
curs when men pick up or leave
a date in the early morning
hours at the front door of a dor-
mitory. Parking is in
designated lots which are
assigned on a space available
basis by our Security staff.
Guests arriving on campus can
complete a temporary parking
registration and obtain passes
at the Information Center.

Vehicles are towed im-
mediately if parked in fire lanes
or in such a manner as to
obstruct traffic. Vehicles are
towed after 12:45 a.m. or 3:45
a.m. (depending on the day) if
they are not parked in their
designated lot or have not been
properly registered.

I hope that this information
1 be helpful. If additional
clarification would be
eficial, please contact me.

Sincerely,

Robert H. Barlow
Dean of Student Affairs
Sweet Briar College

   

Correction

The letter to the editor from
Steve Abraham ‘81, not from
Steve Abraham ‘80 who is on the

Griffin ‘‘Laments”’ editorial

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

Well, you have finally done it.
Until now, I have observed with
amused detachment the
obstreperous rancor that has
occured both in and around the
RtP between student jour-
nalists and student government
members this year. In fact, (as
you know), I have personally
complimented you for having (I
think), improved the paper. But
in the Dec. 1 issue, you have
taken what could and should
have been a good editorial con-
cerning Rick Goddard’s
resignation, and turned it into a
true disservice to your readers.
Rather than hold up Rick’s im-
pressive record of service to the
school community, you used the
occasion to take unwarranted
and (dare I say?), unfounded
pot-shots at the EC I would like
to address myself to three
points you make in your
editorial, ‘‘A Lamentation.”

First of all, you state: ‘‘What
should add to the  public’s
frustration is most of the
members of the EC are glad to
see him go.’’ FALSE. No one,
(not even you, J.M.G.), can ap-
preciate the contributions and
dedication Rick brought to his
job more than the other
members of the EC. I feel I
speak for the whole committee
when I say that we are not
‘glad to see him go.’’ Quite the
contrary, we are sorry that
time constraints forced him to
resign and he will be missed.

Secondly, you write: ‘‘...there
is little wonder he felt his hands
were tied when nearly every
motion he proposed recently
was scoffed at and defeated by
votes of 81 and 9-1.’’ Wrong
again. I refer you to pages one
and nine of your paper (same
issue) where your reporter cor-
rectly lists many of Mr. God-
dard’s achievements as an EC
member. Your reporter also
shows that a large percentage
of the motions that have been
passed by the EC this year were

secinies

proposed by Mr. Goddard.
Lastly, you make the judge-
ment that Rick’s motions
“*...were good ones and above
the comments of his peers. But
it is hard to implement change
in the ‘khaki culture’ if you
aren’t a member.” Surely thou
jest! Any motion made by an
EC member is worthy of com-
ment or there would be no need
for the committee to meet
weekly to kick around the burn-
ing issues of the day. Also, a dif-
ference of opinion does not
translate into a lack of respect,
as you suggest. As for the EC
(myself included, I suppose) be-
ing a bastion of the ‘khaki
culture,’ I again refer you to
your own paper. Specifically,
your own editorial of October
20th praises the EC for
demonstrating intelligent and
responsible action regarding
the Honor System, the Indepen-
dent Exam controversy, and

the funding of the Music Union.

It is my humble opinion that
this year’s EC is representative
of the student population, has
worked hard, and does not cater
to any one “faction.”’ Rick God-
dard has been an effective and
conscientious part of this
representative group. His ef-
forts have been recognized and
admired by at least this EC
member. Rick is a law student
who takes an active interest in
the affairs of the
undergraduates, and_ en-
courages a reciprocating in-
terest on our part. This campus
could use more students like
him. It could also use fewer
students who appear determin-
ed to dwell upon and exploit
situations that can be devisive.
Name-calling, off-the-wall
allegations, and attempts to put
one ‘‘fraction’’ against another
are harmful to everyone con-
cerned, and make life more dif-
ficult for those trying to make a

constructive contribution.
Sincerely,
George F’. Griffin

Letters to Editor

Dear Sir:

After reading last week’s arti-
cle concerning the dispute bet-
ween the editor and business
manager I cannot help but think
that the Ring-tum Phi has failed
to be completely objective. The
article could easily give one the
impression that the Publica-
tions Board witnessed a mighty
power struggle: a contest bet-
ween an authoritarian business
manager and a narrow-minded
editor.

I do not think the Ring-tum
Phi intended to portray Peter
Goss as being insensitive to the
importance of an_ editor’s
responsibilities (i.e. not having
to sacrifice good copy to make
room for more ads), nor did it
intend to portray Mike
Gallagher as being insensitive
to the importance of a business
manager’s responsibilities (i.e.
seeing that production costs are
covered). Unfortunately,
though, by including the
headline ‘‘Gallagher wants 12
pages,” and by re-emphasizing
the arguments Mike Gallagher
introduced at the Nov. 14
meeting while again rebuffing
the points brought up by Peter
Goss, the Ring-tum Phi simply
reproduced the same lack of
communication and refusal to
come to grips with the main
issue that was evidenced at the
meeting.

Even more distressing,
however, is the fact that
theRing-tum Phi devoted so
much coverage to the irrelevant
and inconsequential tangents,
half-truths, and misconceptions
which exemplified the discus-
sion that afternoon. After hav-
ing gone that far the article
could have at least pointed out
that all the unimportant issues
raised, such as the ROTC ad,
the overtime pay for production
costs, and other trivia which
may have unfairly cast doubts
on Peter Goss’ abilities as a
business manager were either
discarded or recognized as hav-
ing no bearing on the topic of
the meeting. But that part was
left out. The result was a
misleading article, one that fail-
ed to discriminate between the
importance of the efforts to
establish an effective system of
regulation and the unim-
portance of the resultant in-
fighting.

Ryland Owen
Pres., Pub. Board

Dear Editor:

I was indeed very pleased to
see in your last week’s issue a
copy of that Hollins’ editorial

espousing the glorious virtues ©

of women while castigating the
corrupt, polluted minds of men.
I agreed wholeheartedly with
the opinions expressed in this
fine piece of journalism and,
likewise, found it deplorable the
way the women are treated
around here. It’s positively
disgusting to see grown men
purposely try to take advantage
of these poor, sweet, innocent,
and saintly creatures just to
satify their male egos or relieve
their sexual frustrations, not
caring a whore’s tooth for the
women they have just degrad-
ed.

My girl friend, who happens
to go to Hollins, and I were just
discussing this problem the
other night and after she finish-
ed sucking my big toe, we got
into the meat of the matter. I
told her how the men here try to
corral their unknowing victims
by getting them drunk as quick-
ly as possible so to make the
trip to the, what’s the word
again, oh yes, rack a great deal
easier and less time consuming.
My girl friend said she was ap-
palled at such antics and could
not believe that the men here
would be so callous as to force
the devil’s drink down these
pure, unsuspecting women’s
throats. She wouldn’t discuss
the matter any further,
however, but after polishing off
her sixth gin and tonic, told me
that it’s also a disgrace how
men here think that the only job
suitable for women, due to their
supposedly feeble minds, is as a
homemaker. I agreed with her
and said there should be more
women nuclear physicists. She
agreed, but wasn’t quite sure
what a nuclear physicist was.

We ended our conversation by
concluding that most men here
are utterly hopeless while the
women, ever honest and loyal in
their mature relationships with
men, are righteous beyond
reproach, never allowing their
precious bodies to be used for
cheap sex, and thus belong en-
shrined in the Virgin’s Hall of
Fame. We agreed on this, of
course, but not after my girl
friend finished sucking my
other toe.

Sincerely yours,
Ring Lardner

E.C. unsure

(continued from page 1)

that he is concerned by the fact
that Dan Scott, night manager
of the Cockpit, had signed Sun-
nyland Slim, a Cockpit enter-
tainer, to a contract. University
Center Committee chairman
Galen Trussell should be
responsible for signing acts into
the Cockpit, Bovay said.

Trussell disputed the conten-
tion that the Union only had $207
left. He said it was his
understanding that some forms
of entertainment which had
been charged to the Union were
to be paid by the SAB. “‘My
understanding was I -would
spent $2,200 on Cockpit enter-
tainment,” Trussell said.

SAB co-chairman Charlie
Hulfish, however, said it was
his understanding that the
“Music Union would provide

entertainment, including
movies and acts.”’
EC members, however,

recalled that the money given to
the Union was solely for
musical entertainment. Thus,
the committee voted
unanimously to require the SAB
to pay $158 for movies which
had been shown in the Cockpit
and $101 for magazine subscrip-
tions for the UC library. This
left the Union with a balance of
$467.
Mike Missal asked Trussell,
“Did you realize you’d spent 75
per cent of your budget
already?”

One reason entertainment in
the fall term has been so lavish,
said Scott, is that new copy
right laws call into question the
possibility of having any enter-
tainment at all in the Cockpit. A
royalty must be paid for every
son a performer plays which
was not written by himself,
Scott said. A violation will cost
$250 per song, he added.

The school has hired an at-
torney to look into the matter,
said Scott. The attorney, Eric
Sisler, has recommended that
no entertainment be held in the
Cockpit until the school deter-
mines the legal situation, Scott
said.

The other reason there has —

been so much fall entertain-
ment at the expense of winter
entertainment is that there are
three big weekends in February
during which Cockpit entertain-
ment would be unfeasible, Scott
said.

Scott went onto defend
Trussell by saying that Trussell
was under the impression that
the Cockpit would be able to

of Music Union control

recover me money by charging
a cover charge.

When asked why the Cockpit
had decided not to charge the
EC authorized cover for the
Sunnyland Slim _ concert,
Trussell responded, “‘Because it
would have been totally ineffec-
tual.’’ He said it only would
have irritated people and it
wouldn’t have done much to off-
set the cost of the performance.

Scott was asked why he sign-
ed the contract for Sunnyland
Slim, even though he has no
authority over acts brought into
the Cockpit by the MU. Scott
said he did so because Trussell
was on vacation at the time the
contract had to be signed.

Scott went on to stress that
the Cockpit management is
vitally interested in what acts
go on in the Cockpit because, as
Jerry Darrell, Cockpit
manager, said, “it helps our
business.”’ Trussell said that,
up until the past two weeks, the
Cockpit has been contributing
between 50 and 60 per cent of
the money which has gone into
entertainment. Darrell said the
Cockpit has been making
money and wants to channel it
back into student entertain-
ment. Darrell said he thinks it’s
the Cockpit’s prerogative to be
able to charge a cover, but he
would be willing to come before
the EC to discuss it on a week-
by-week basis.

EC president Jim Underhill
said, “That’s one of the pro-
blems the EC is having. We
thought we’d have more con-
trol.”’ Another aspect of this
lack of control was hinted at
when Underhill said, ‘We
wonder who’s running the

‘operation:” Trussell or Scott.

Trussell was appointed by the
EC, and, is therefore, accoun-
table to it but Scott is accoun-
table to no one, except to
Trussell, who, many EC
members feel, just ratifies
Scott’s entertainment ~ deci-
sions.

It was made clear to Scott
that he was to be only an ad-
visor, Darrell said in response.
However, Scott is probably do-
ing more than he should be do-
ing,’’ Darrell admitted. Yet he’s
been able to bring in quality
entertainment at a relatively
low cost, he added.

Trussell complained that few
Music Union members were
showing up to meetings, mean-
ing he had to make all decisions

concerning Cockpit entertain-
ment. Because Scott has more
expertise in getting acts to
W&L, he usually let Scott take
care of arranging the entertain-
ment, while final approval must
come from him, Trussell said.
In further action, the EC
voted unanimously that com-
mittee co-chairmen be required
to meet with their ad hoc
member to discuss expen-
ditures at least three times a
year; once in the fall, winter
and spring terms. The meeting
in the spring term would have to
occur at least a week before ex-
ams. The motion was submitted
by parting EC law school
representative Rick Goddard.

Cappeto said that there would
have to be some resolution of
the problem before the beginn-
ing of next year. Washington
and Lee musical entertainment
will certainly suffer, because
royalty fees will have to be
budgeted into future entertain-
ment plans and, as a result less
entertainment, will probably be
forthcoming.

(continued from page 1)
Kunstler said.

The trials were labeled
‘Federal Conspiracy Trials.”
Kunstler translated
“conspiracy” to mean a crime
of thinking.

The trial of Benjamin Spock
was the first conspiracy trial of
the peace movement, Kunstler
said. Spock represented the in-
tellectual movement against
the war, and in 1967, he and five
others were accused of con-
spiracy to pervert the youth of
America. They had _ been
outspoken proponents of draft
resistence.

In 1971, nuns and priests who
had burned draft records in
Maryland were charged with
conspiracy to kidnap Henry
Kissinger. The kidnapping plot
involved a bizarre scheme to
sue grenades to destroy the
heating system at the Capitol so
that Kissinger could be ab-
ducted during the commotion.

It was later revealed, that
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover
had bribed a prisoner at the
Harrisburg, Pa., penitentiary to
come forth with false testimony

which would incriminate Philip
Berrigan. Berrigan was one of
the accused priests who also
served time in the Harrisburg
prison.

All of the accused were ac-
quitted, but the government
really did win these cases. It got
the revolutionaries caught up in
time consuming trials so that
their energies could not be
devoted towards the anti-war
movement.

The one trial that the govern-
ment really wanted to win was

The judge did not give in, and
for the first time, the govern-
ment lost the case because of
“governmental criminaltiy.”’

This, Kunstler said, marked
the end of the government’s use
of political trials to end the
peace movement. The average
citizen was no longer against
the revolutionaries; he was
against the war.
