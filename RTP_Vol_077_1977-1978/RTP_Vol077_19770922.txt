~ SAB chairmen storm back

Berley, Armstrong
refute allegations

by J. Michael Gallagher

Last year’s co-chairman John
_ Berley told the Phi Wednesday

> that inadequacies did exist in

the SAB’s accounting pro-
cedures, but that the SAB was
“only following an E.C. outline
on how to keep records’. He
said that the SAB had not been
required to keep the receipts of
expenditures made, (which

E.C. law representative Rick

Goddard last week alledged to
have been burned) but instead
only kept record of the
vouchers. (The RtP has seen
these vouchers, and SAB ad-
visor Mike Cappeto said, ‘‘to the
best of my knowledge, these
records are complete’’. )

Berley admitted that this was
an inefficient way of keeping
records, but said that he and
Mike Armstrong had, early last

year, recommended to the E.C.
to do away with the old practice
of keeping records, and to adopt
a more efficient one. Berley
said this was not done.

Addressing another part of
the article, Berley said that it
was true that during Winter
Weekend an SAB member had
kept $2000 in the trunk of his
car, but denied that the
member was _ intoxicated.
Berley refused to identify the
SAB member.

Berley said at Monday night’s
E.C. meeting that the SAB had
not regularly held parties for its
members at student body ex-
pense. He pointed out that the
E.C. had approved funds for a
Fancy Dress party for the
members. Berley told the Phi
Wednesday that he had failed to

Calyx reports theft

by Galen Trussell

Over $400 in cash was stolen
from the Calyx business office
in the Student Center last Tues-
day, after the money was col-
lected during matriculation.

According to Calyx editor
Temp Webber, a total of $1,318
was collected for yearbook pic-
tures during matriculation last
Tuesday. Webber said the
money was to be deposited in
the Calyx account with the
University, however, the money
was not deposited because the
person depositing the money
didn’t know the Calyx account
number. Since the money
couldn’t be deposited it was
brought back to the Calyx office
and hidden in a desk drawer.

Webber recalled locking the
door on his way out at 3:30 Tues-
day afternoon. When he return-
ed to the office at approximate-
ly 5:45 p.m., he found the door
unlocked but didn’t check the
money. The next morning Web-
ber and business manager
Grant Leister recounted the
money and found they only had
$918. The total amount missing
is $410.

Webber said he had no idea .

how the money could have
disappeared, but that it must
have been stolen between 3:30
p.m. Tuesday and 9 a.m.
Wednesday. Webber and
Leister are the only two
students with keys to the Calyx
office.

According to Mike Cappeto,
Student Center director, all
locks in the Student Center were
changed over the summer and
no student have master keys.

Webber said as of yet he
wasn’t sure how the robbery
was going to effect this year’s
Calyx. He said he wouldn’t
know until after E.C. budget
hearings next week. Webber did
conceed that he will ask the
E.C. for more money in lieu of
the robbery.

 

EC votes 5-4-1]

 

by Lee Howard

Charlie Hulfish was retained
as Student Activities Board co-
chairman by a 5-4 vote Monday
night during an emotional and
tension-wrought Executive
Committee meeting.

Hulfish, it was reported in the
Ring-tum Phi last week, ‘ook
out a loan of $175 from SAB
funds on March 9. The loans
was made with the understan-
ding it should be paid back
within two weeks. Hulfish said
he did not pay back the loan un-
til Sept. 13. The Phi was inacu-
curate in stating last week that
the loan had not been paid back
as of Sept. 16.

Hulfish said the reason he
asked for the loan and the
reason he was unable to repay
the loan were related to the
financial affairs of his parents.
He said his parents are divorc-
ed and remarried. His step-
father ran into financial dif-
ficulties and deserted his
mother, while his father was
forced to declare bankruptcy
and is not working as a chauf-
feur, he said.

Hulfish stressed he had every
intention of paying back the
loan within the required time.
Unfortunately a child support
payment of $200 was not for-
thcoming becuase of the finan-
cial situation of his father, and
he was also being sued by his
landlord, and paying legal fees,
he said.

When asked why he hadn’t
asked the business office or the
Emergency Loan Committee
for a loan, Hulfish said he

Hulfish retaine

already owed the business of-
fice $145 and he understood the
Emergency Loan Committee
had a $50 limit on loans.

The $175 loan went for the
purpose of making a deposit on
a house for the coming year,
Hulfish said. He said the rental
of houses is on a first-come,
first-served basis and he
wanted to be sure of securing a
particular house. He paid back
the loan at the beginning of this
school year. On Sept. 18 after
the Ring-tum Phi article ap-
peared stating that Rick God-
dard would ask for repayment
of the loan with interest, Hulfish
gave Jim Foreman $9.29 for in-
terest on the loan, sources said.
That’s nine per cent interest,
Hulfish said.

Goddard, senior law school
representative on the E.C.,
made the motion to remove
Hulfish. He said that Hulfish us-
ed SAB money “‘in contraven-
tion of the intended use.’’ He
said that the E.C. was faced
with a “precedent” of what to
do about a person who misuses
funds. He said Hulfish was plac-
ed in a position of trust and he
abused it. Goddard said the
issue was not whether the SAB
would be able to put homecom-
ing on without Hulfish, the issue
was whether or not Hulfish
abused his trust by taking out
the loan.

Others disagreed with God-
dard, saying the fact that
Hulfish did not try to hide the
loan and paid back the loan with

Goddard

clarifies
charges

The Ring-tum Phi stirred up
quite a bit of controversy this
week when it printed allega-
tions made by Rick Goddard
that the SAB had made
unauthorized expenditures,
kept poor accounting records,
etc. Goddard attempted to
clarify some of his allegations
at Monday’s Executive Com-
mittee meeting.

Goddard said his allegation
that SAB receipts were all buris-
ed at the end of the past
academic year came from a
source within the SAB, Tim
Hendry, last year’s treasurer.
However, Goddard said, now he
believes such a statement was

conjecture on Hendry’s part. He

said Hendry told him he didn’t
know what happened to the
receipts. ‘‘As far as I know they
could have been burned,”’ God-
dard quoted Hendry as saying.
Goddard stressed that he had
no intention of impugning the
character of either of last
year’s co-chairman, Mike Arm-
strong and John Berley. He just
wanted to bring it to the atten-
tion of the student body that
some of the accounting pro-
cedures followed by last year’s
SAB ‘were sloppy,’ he said. By
pointing out the fact that it was
impossible to determine the
legitimacy of certain expen-
ditures without receipts, he was
just trying to underline the
faults of the system, not charge
the co-chairmen with any
wrong-doing, Goddard said. He
added that he was sure every
single expense was legitimate.
Despite grilling by Berley,
Goddard refused to back down
on some of his other accusa-
tions. He maintained that
sources within the SAB told him
that the SAB held unauthorized
parties at the expense of the stu-
dent fund. Berley catagorically
denied this and asked Goddard
to reveal his sources so the
misconception could be put to
rest. Goddard refus ‘ed to do so.

‘ He also couldn’t name the dates

the parties were supposed to
have been held.

Goddard also maintained that
because money was left in the
SAB office overnight, there was
a substantial amount of theft.
While some SAB members ad-
mitted money was left in the of-
fice overnight, Berley denied
any stealing had occurred.

IFC less severe
on frat violations

by Reid Slaughter

As the fifth week of rush ap-
proaches, one of the more
unpleasant aspects has to be
dealt with—that of rush viola-
tions. Each of the sixteen
fraternities has been notified of
their alleged violations and will
be given a chance to appeal any
or all of them before the Student
Affairs Committee this Wednes-
day.

Violations range from failing
to return rushees back to the
Freshman Quad by _ the
specified time, to openly dispen-
sing beer or liquor during Open
Houses. The amount of each
fine depends on the relative
seriousness of each individual

offense, and usually range from
a low of $5.00.to a high of
$150.00. In some cases, the fine
is suspended and only a warn-
ing given.

According to IFC Vice Presi-
dent Howdy Knipp, this year’s
committee is “more conscien-
tious; more aware of rush of-
fenses and how to deal with
them.’’ This is in response to
protests by fraternities last
year that the IFC was being to
harsh in the levying of fines
without proper warning or in-
vestigation. This was perhaps
due to the fact that less offenses
were discovered, and IFC of-
ficials handed out maximum
penalties to cover the violations

that were not found out.

The result is that this year the
IFC has given out more warn-
ings and less severe fines for
minor offenses. There have,
however, been reports of major
offenses, but specific details
will not be available until at
least after Wednesday’s Stu-
dent Affairs meeting.

IFC officials remind fraterni-
ty members that until the Oc-
tober preference card date, all
rules of rush apply and will be
enforced. Final reports on
specific offenses and the frater-
nities involved in those offenses
will appear on a later issue of
the Ring-tum Phi.

Homecoming bands named

by Kenneth Mastrilli

Archie Bell and the Drells,
along with M.F. Rattlesnake
will highlight W&L’s
Homecoming weekend this
year, if Evans Dining Hall
manager Jerry Darrell can pro-
duce a liquor license allowing
beer to be carried throughout
the University Center complex,
it was revealed Tuesday by Stu-
dent Activities Board co-
chairman Charlie Hulfish.

If this one-night license can-
not be obtained for the dance,
then a different band will have
to be contacted in place of Ar-
chie Bell and the Drells, ac-
cording to Hulfish, if one could
be found at such a late date.

New SAB Co-chairman Bill
Tucker said that most of the
good rock bands in the SAB’s
price range had already been
booked up, but that the SAB was
able to sign M.F. Rattlesnake
for approximately $600. This
little-known band has agreed to
play anywhere on campus, in-
cluding Zollman’s Pavilion, a
place where the ‘“‘Drells’’ ab-
solutely refuse to play, ac-
cording to SAB secretary Tom
McCarthy.

For the sake of freshmen,
Zollman’s Pavilion is an old,
dilapidated storage building
about six miles out of town
that’s frequently rented by
W&L, VMI and Southern
Seminary Junior College for big
weekends and various and sun-
dry activities.

Archie Bell and the Drells are
a popular soul group, popular
enough to command $2,200 for a
performance which should last
at least fifty minutes, according
to McCarthy. However, they in-
sist the only place where they
are willing to play is at Evans
Dining Hall, otherwise they will
not play here, said McCarthy.
They insist on having a big area
where students can dance and
move freely.

Reducing congestion and sav-
ing money are also reasons that
the SAB wants to open up the
whole University Center for
Homecoming as well as Fancy
Dress, according to SAB.

We could save money if
students were allowed to. take
their beers with them when they
want to leave the Dining Hall.

When they get back, students
always want a new beer instead
of finishing the old one,’’ said
McCarthy.

Dining Hall manager Jerry
Darrell is in the process of try-
ing to contact the local ABC
agent who, according to sources
within the SAB, holds conser-
vative views a little to the right
of Barry Goldwater. ‘‘He’s a
very conservative guy,’’ said
McCarthy, ‘‘and we don’t want
to pressure him.”’

“The SAB, McCarthy said,
“hopes to convince the agent
that for safety’s sake it would
be better to open the whole stu-
dent center.’’ McCarthy cited a
hypothetical example where so-
meone might be hurt out in the
middle of the dance floor, and
“if the congestion was eased up
somewhat, it would be much
easier to get help to someone
that needed it.”’

SAB co-chairman Tucker
says he does not want to risk
losing the Dining Hall’s liquor
license for Fancy Dress, and is
willing to “let Homecoming

ride for a good Fancy Dress.”’
The traditional Thursday
night Pavilion party has also
been canned this year under
what can only be described as
“administration pressure to
take it easy,”’ according to SAB
secretary Tommy McCarthy. In
fact the only Thursday night
party all year long will be dur-
ing Fancy Dress. McCarthy
would not divulge the names of
any specific admininstration of-
ficials who had applied the
pressure to rid W&L of these
Thursday night extravaganzas.
Friday evening, October 9, is
the big night. Both bands are
expected to play at least 50
minutes apiece starting around
8:30 p.m. Hopefully, beer will
be served. The exact cost has
not yet been determined, ac-
cording to McCarthy. Saturday
afternoon there will be a grain
party at Zollman’s beginning
around 2 or 3 p.m. It’s not yet
known whether entertainment
will be provided at this affair.
Class passes will be required.

Tucker new SAB

co-chairman

by Randy Smith

In a special session Tuesday,
the Executive Committee ac-
cepted Bill Tucker’s application
to help head the Student Ac-
tivities Board. Tucker, a junior
with two years experience on
the SAB, replaces the absent
Doug Jackson as co-chairman,
entering the position at a time
when the committee is facing
heavy criticism for fund misap-
propriation. Tucker’s avowed
goal as co-chairman is to
‘reinstate a sense of confidence
in the students for the integrity
of the SAB.”

In addition to his respon-
Sibilities as co-chairman,
Tucker will also have the duty
of coordinating activities in the
Cockpit. The goal of manager
Jerry Darrell, who is working
closely with Tucker, is to in-
crease the utilization of the
Cockpit’s facilities by W&L
students. Both are hopeful that

through a more consistent live
entertainment program and
new innovations—such as a
‘‘gong show’’—that their goal of
more student involvement with
the Cockpit will be realized.

Homecoming weekend is the
first major problem facing the
new co-chairman. Because of
various problems, there is, at
this writing, no place where
students can drink beer and
listen to the two bands schedul-
ed to play the night of October
7th.

SAB and administration of-
ficials have been negotiating
with the regional director of
Virginia’s Alcohol Beverage
Control to obtain a 24 hour li-
quor license for the dining room
with little success. Many rules
and stipulations not only make
the license difficult to get, but
jeopardize future beer con-
sumption anywhere in the Stu-

Political clubs

get equal time

Republicans

’ by Dave Talley

The Washington and Lee Col-
lege Republicans have been
named “Best Club in the Na-
tion’’ by the College Republican
National Committee. The W&L
CR’s have held this title for 8 of
the last 10 years. ‘‘Naturally we
are thrilled with this, the
highest honor bestowed on any
College Republican club,” said
President Steve Yeakel, ‘“‘but
the CR movement has progress-
ed so much in the last few years
that the pressures of maintain-
ing this honor are great,
possibly too great. We will
simply continue to devote our
efforts to the movement, keep-
ing in mind that hard work and
camaraderie are as important
as any award we can receive.”

“On the contrary,” Yeakel
added, “losing the title would
cause problems. We've got this
Stationery, you see...’’

The club also reports that the
membership drive during
matriculation resulted in a roll
of over 300 members. ‘‘We con-
sider this very successful for a
non-presidential election year,”
President Yeakel said.

The W&L CR’s kick-off their
social calendar on Friday with
their annual fall picnic. ‘‘The
picnic is always one of the
club’s biggest events of the
year,” says Mark Mainwaring,
membership chairman. ‘This
year we’re expecting about 150
girls from around the state to
attend and, as always, we’ll
have plenty of good food, beer,
and music.’’ The picnic will be
held in Woods Creek meadow
behind the Woods Creek apart-
ments from 5:30 p.m. on. It is
open to members only, but
memberships will be available

 

at the event.

Democrats

by Tony Carli

The Washington and Lee
Young Democrats were born
again last year and it was ex-
pected by some that it would
continue its phoenix-like ex-
istence. The organization’s new
president, Lee Cave, seems to
have the battle cry, “Life,
Never Die!’’ He argues that
they are not on a quitoxical
quest to compete with the Col-
lege Republicans, rather, their
objective is to form a viable
political organization with
which to be reckoned.

To initiate this journey, the
Best Small College Club in the
Commonwealth (to quote the
award they received at last

April’s Young Democrat state;

convention) is to hold its first
meeting of the year, tonight at
7:30 in the Student Center. They
hope to acquaint new members
and those possibly interested in
the club with their plans for the
coming year. Of high priority on
the plans list, is the organiza-
tion’s inauguration of a speaker
program which will feature
several up and _ coming
Democrats from throughtout
the country. Democrats from
Sweet Briar, Randolph-Macon
W. C., UVa., Richmond, and
Lynchburg are planning to at-
tend.

This no-so-new Young
Democrat club just might be
one of the fastest growing clubs
on campus. With a doubling of
its membership in just two days
of matriculation last week, that’
observation just might not be
too far-fetched.

 

 

SAE remodels house

by Ned McDonnell

While most fraternities on the
W&L campus had to start from
scratch on repairs and
maintenance during the pre-
Rush work week, one house,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, had a
substantial head start thanks to
a $75,000 grant from the Univer-
sity. And where did most of this
money go? ‘‘Behind the walls,”
notes one “E’’, meaning the
reconstitution of the plumbing
systems and electrical wiring of
the aged, clapboard house.

Other features include a new
paint-job of the interior of the
building, new storage space in
the basement, extensive
remodeling of the bathrooms,
and new thick, near fire-proof
doors for the bedrooms. Aside
from the doors, other anit-fire
improvements included the in-
stallation of new smoke and fire
alarms and a new wrought-iron
fire escape for added safety of
brothers living in the house.

The repairs undertaken at
SAE this fall reflect the tighten-
ed safety standards for older
multiple housing units around

Virginia. With these standards,
SAE sophomores can now have
the best of two worlds: the
charm of those beautiful clap-
board homes of past eras with
the added safety of modern
residential living.

Hulfish retained

(continued from page one)

interest showed his integrity.
Also, because information
about the loan has become
public, it was argued that
Hulfish would be sure not to
make the same mistake again.
Sophomore representative An-
dy Bodenstab commented that
the SAB got more interest from
Hulfish’s loan payment that
they would have gotten from a
bank.

Hulfish advocates said that
homecoming would probably
not come off without the co-
chairman. They said there was
too little time and too much to
do for a new co-chairman to
step in and learn the ropes.

When the votes were counted
Hulfish had been retained by a
5-4 margin, with one abstension.
Goddard, Neil Pentifallo, Mike
Missal and Jack Bovay voted to
depose Hulfish. Jim Underhill,
Doug Perkins, Jim Davis, Steve
Abraham and Andy Bodenstab
voted to retain him. George
Griffin abstained.

Although Goddard lost his
fight to have Hulfish deposed, a
proposal of his to safeguard
against the misuse of student
body funds by student organiza-
tions passed unanimously. This
was Goddard’s four point pro-

posal:
1. New accounting guidelines

— All student organizations
must from now on retain all
receipts. This is to make sure
all checks can be proven to have
been written for legitimate pur-
poses. The SAB had previously
only kept receipts for a month
or two.

8 Authority for
disbursements — Only the
chairman and the treasurer of
each student organization will
have the authority to make
disbursements. Those persons
are on their honor to account for
all monies disbursed. It is
presumed to be an honor viola-
tion if these persons cannot ac-
count for the monies.

3. Loans — No student group
may authorize a loan.

4. Safeguarding money — The
E.C. authorized the SAB to get
night deposit bags so they could
make deposits after the
business office closes at 5 p.m.
Previously the policy had been
to lock the money in the office of
University Center director
Mike Cappeto. However on oc-
casion the SAB did leave the
money overnight in its office.

dent Center (even in the
Cockpit). The regional director
has also cautioned that if such a
license were granted, ABC of-
ficials would be on hand to
monitor student conformity to
the provisions of the temporary
grant.

Although the gym _ would
make a good setting for the
Homecoming concert, past ex-
perience assures that Coach
Dick Miller would not allow
alcoholic beverages in the
building. To get around his rul-
ing, kegs could be placed out-
side and beer consumed there.
But Tucker pointed out that this
plan was implemented two
years ago with most people
gathered around the beer and
few students inside listening to
the music.

Tucker gave a third option, or
the Zollman’s Pavilion solution,
which has been virtually
eliminated because the school
grain party and various frater-
nity parties will take place
there Saturday night. Also of
some consequence, the soul
band scheduled for Friday
refuses to play there. Tucker
said that they had apparently

     
    
 

played to a W&L crowd at the
Pavilion before.

With all the complications in-
volved, Tucker said that there
is a_ possibility of a dry
Homecoming night on the 7th,
but was hopeful that a solution
could be worked out in the next
two weeks. ‘Jerry Darrell is
backing us all the way and do-
ing his best to get the liquor
license changed.” However,
Tucker was quick to suggest
that the reason behind the
SAB’s trouble in obtaining the
proper liquor license was a
“reflection on the students” and
their past behavior on such oc-
casions.

Dean John named

director of NASPA

Lewis G. John, dean of
students at Washington and Lee
University, has been named
director of the division of
governmental relations and
legislation of the National
Association of Student Person-
nel Administrators (NASPA).

In his new capacity with the
organization he also becomes a
member of its overall executive
committee.

John, W&L’s chief student-
services dean since 1969 and
director of financial aid prior to
then, has been a member of the
government-legislation division
of the deans’ organization. He
will be its director through
mid-1979.

John is also the author of an
article, ‘‘Student-Consumer
Protection in Higher Educa-
tion,”’ to be published in a for-
thcoming issue of the NASPA
journal.

A British judge will speak
about Great Britain’s court
system at Washington and Lee
University next Monday night,
Sept. 26.

The Honourable Edward
Eveleigh, a judge of the High
Court of Justice, Queen’s Bench
Division, will lecture on the
topic ‘From Arrest to Verdict
in an English Criminal Court”
at 8 p.m. in the Moot Court

Room in Lewis Hall. .

As a justice on the High
Court, Sir Edward has tried
both civil and criminal cases.
He sits on the criminal division
of the Court of Appeals and
works with the Lord Chief
Justice and one other judge in
the Divisional Court, which is
primarily concerned with ad-
ministrative law and appeals
from statutory tribunals.

He is in the United States as a
member of an eight-man team
of English lawyers meeting
with a team of American
lawyers on the subject of civil
and criminal appellate pro-
cedures. The American team is
led by Chief Justice Warren E.
Burger. The British team is led
by a member of the House of
Lords, England’s highest court
of appeals.

Sir Edward has been a
member of the Bar Council and
the Supreme Court Rules Com-
mittee, president of the British
German Jurists Association
and presiding judge of the South
Eastern Circuit for four years.
England’s Central Criminal
Court, also known as “the Old
Bailey,’’ was within that
jurisdiction.

The public is invited to attend
the lecture.

members were helping lug fil-
ing cabinets to the upstairs of-
fice.

After E.C. members had
finished questioning Berley and
after Berley had reciprocated
with Goddard, the former co-
chairman referred to the Ring-
tum Phi. Citing last week’s arti-
cle and speaking for Arm-
strong, Berley said, “This arti-
cle casts extreme doubt on our
honesty and integrity.’’ He then
threatened to bring a lawsuit
against the Ring-tum Phi for
libel.

A Traveler
from

Altruria

Some things a freshman
should never say to an up-
perclassman:

1. “What is ‘going down the
road?’ Sounds like a song from
The Wiz.”’ No, no. That’s Ease
On Down The Road. Besides, if
you mention a song from a
black musical, they'll im-
mediately castigate you as a
soul freak.

2. ‘You are not a stud.’’ Most
people would be very pleased if
you affirmed to them the fact
that they weren’t a fat old horse
useful only for breeding pur-
poses. But at W&L you might as
well call a person a eunuch.
Very touchy, these eunuchs.

3. “W&L is not very good
academically.”” Please. Our
school, which we have paid
$3,300 per year to attend, not
good academically? With such
reknowned professors as....,

sheepskin is expensive this
year.

from a 6’6’’, 230 pound hungry-
looking guerilla who is male, I
assure you. And he carries a big
stick.

5. ‘The Republican party
should waste away and die.”
Hold your tongue lest thou be
branded a communist and be
brought before the Student Con-
trol Committee on pot-smoking
charges. For everyone at W&L
knows GOP-liness is next to

6. “Everyone seems to be
wearing a uniform of khakis,

Shhh. Chances are the person to

Spanish Drama Memorable

After being in attendance at
the Monday night performance
of the Spanish troupe of Carmen
Keymann and others, one ma-
jor thought comes to mind. Why
isn’t more of this type of drama
done at Washington and Lee?
The audience at the Troubadour
was most appreciative as
regards the unique form of
theatre, unlike any available in
the United States. Speaking
briefly, the troupe’s presenta-
tion was a perfect example of a
total theatre experience:
visually, orally, emotionally...

The hour-long show was com-
prised of four short sketches,
each dealing with the important
Spanish theme of honor (a con-

cept certainly not foreign in this
community).

The first related the tale of a
miller, a mayor, and their
respective wives. In a com-
plicated series of events, they
go to bed with the other’s spouse
(complicated?). In  counter-
point to this serious study was
lighter examination of marital
fidelity — this time by use of a
puppet, quizzed by the cloaked
puppeteer on the actions of his
wife.

The probable highlight of the
entire show was a farce foe pup-
pets by Garcia Lorca. The tale
of the drunk Don Christobel and
his wife Rosita, who on her wed-
ding night (due to the drunken
state of her husband) turns to
four other men for satisfaction.

I’m sure we've all heard, at
one time or another, from many
members of the previous
generation, that today’s enter-
tainment world is nothing more
than glorified trash. We are
constantly told that the music is
repetitive, idiotic, toneless, and
totally lacking in artistic quali-
ty; that the artists who record
records are worthless in an in-
dustry where it seems everyone
is a star; that today’s television
is a witless reflection of the il-
literate society it plays to; that
the movie industry could never
hope to attain the achievements
in entertainment and fantasy

or four decades preceding 1960,
and that the stars—the Hep-
burns, Tracys, Bogarts, and
Garlands—are irreplaceable
remnants of the past.

In defiance of many of my
contemporary elders, I must
declare that we have much to be
proud of in the performing arts.
I wouldn’t be ashamed to com-
pare a Paul McCartney, Robert

Fireworks galore! The E.C.
meeting was a trip and a half.
I’ve never seen so much
fireworks since a certain SAE
freshman voted in favor of the
Spinners vs. Peter Frampton.
Speaking of the E’s, we hear
that their diplomat from Little
Rock was arrested for indecent
exposure in Lexington. Rumor
has it it was somewhere near
VMI...kinky! Sort of reminds us
of last year when Mr. Alabama
shot the old woman at Hollins in
the face with a fire ex-
tinguisher. Congratulations
SAE pledges, boy are you in for
a good time.

Some of the SAB from last
year as well as this year were
present at the E.C. fiasco. Ab-
sent was our little friend. He
had a previous engagement to
pour tea at Dr. Simpson’s gala
opening of DuPont Art Gallery.
Our favorite artist was there
wearing her favorite dress, as
always. Alsé present were those
two dogs.

I was snooping around Du-
Pont annex(sculpture studio)

with some very interesting
photos of naked students. That’s
funny, I didn’t see that in the

The editor of the Phi was
trashpicking again and came up
with several checks from the
cockpit signed by a whiskered
ex-SAB czar. This ought to be
exciting.

Dean Diddle’s boy dean made
his first appearance at the IFC

talked. No one listened.

Students should not loot the

same lock and key laden lad
was scheduled as the main at-
traction at a dinner party last

attracted the host and one ex-
tremely thirsty friend. No
RSVP for that guest of honor.

Likewise, the movies are by
no means forever gone, and
Kathleen Quinlan, Robert
DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, and
Lisa Minelli (in her own right),
among others, can all hold their
heads high in any discussion
concerning talent—past or pre-

we have been given many
superb productions, some of
which include ‘‘Rocky,”’ “New

However, before the contem-

it deserves, it must learn to
recognize the worthless idiocy

he has learned to disregard any
respect for art in order to find

cialism.

Our man Don doesn’t deviate
an inch from this philosophy for
this latest endeavor. After
witnessing a second rate per-
formance of black-style jazz
dancing—done to the theme
from “Rocky’—we are told
that this year’s award has been
named the ‘“‘Rocky’s” (sorry
Elvis fans). Then we are
presented Olivia ‘‘My-Face-
Alone-Will-Sell-A-Million-
Copies’? Newton-John, and
Peter Frampton (oops! Talent!
Ya Slipped There Don!), who
tell us the awards are given by
the artists themselves. Various
guests come and go, including
Dolly Parton, who is trying to
go total pop superstar, and
whose agent must have worked
like hell to get her the spot.
There is an appearance by
“Star Wars’’’s R2D2, who has a
conversation with Frampton
that would make Peter Pan
barf. Olivia and Frampton
seemed to go out of their way to
let people know that they were
reading cue cards, although
that seemed to distract the
viewer from the hideousness of
the dialogue.

More trash to think about:

Bizarre, but enjoyable.

The troupe is on the last leg of
a tour begun this summer, spon-
sored by the Foreighn Ministry

their home base in Madrid. In
concluding, it is perhaps best to
echo the words of Mr. Laurent
Boetsch of W&L’s Spanish

of the group, he said, ‘The new

Carlos could not have sent bet-
ter ambassadors to the U.S.’ At
the end of the performance,

If you don’t have to worry

good tanning or sun-blocking

all your problems. Sun and

a moisturizer, such as Tan

thing to use when you get

Winners

by Hugh Sisson

Among the more interesting
new releases is an album on the
Arista label entitled ‘‘Happy
The Man”’ by a new group of the
same name. The music is pro-
gressive featuring some ex-
cellent keyboard work not
unlike Genesis or Yes, yet the
overall sound is not an imita-
tion. This is an exciting new
sound incorporating some old,
familiar elements in a new for-
mat. Recommended!

Also in the progressive vein
but more accessible than their
earlier work is the new Gentle
Giant album, “‘Missing Piece.”
If you’ve like their music in the
past, you ought to give this one
a listen, and if you’ve never
heard of them before, now is the
time to open your ears. This
band was been around a long
time and they have managed to
create a unique sound in the
rock world.

Lastly for jazz _ lovers
(especially piano) are two new
releases from Keith Jarrett:
“Staircase” and ‘‘Byablue.”’
“Staircase” presents Jarrett at
his best in solo piano improvisa-
tion making for truly pleasant
and imaginative listening.
‘“‘Byablue,” on the other hand,
features some of the best small
accoustic jazz combo playing to
be had these days. Jarrett is one
of our most productive talents
in jazz.

Monkey Island
Geils
Atlantic SD 19103

Having finally seen Geils in
concert (stealing the show from
Peter Frampton, incidentally),
it’s easy to see why the group
has such a devoted following.
Live, they’re one of the tightest
bands around, and one of the
most exciting as well. Lead
singer Peter Wolf has seeming-
ly limitless energy onstage,
twisting, jumping, and dancing
in a manner that would do
justice to Mick Jagger. Un-
fortunately, Geils (formerly the
J. Geils Band) has frequently
had difficulties transferring

this excitement to vinyl. Their
Studio albums have always
seemed to be mere shadows of
their live records and concerts.

This is not so with Monkey
Island, perhaps because Geils’
latest LP represents a bit of a
change in style for the band.
The basic Geils sound is
definitely there, butsome of the
‘get up and boogie’ feeling has
been replaced by a more laid-
back style. In addition, the
band’s always excellent in-
strumentals are event better
than usual on this LP, and are
slightly more complex. The title
track is an excellent example of
this more interesting  in-
Strumental style. After a
reggae-ish intro segment, the
band builds slowly to each
chorus, finally moving into a
rousing rock & roll finale
(complete with the famous
Geils saxaphone). With
somewhat eerie lyrics and
vocals to top it off, “Monkey
Island’’ ranks as one or the best
things Geils has done to date.

Diehard Geils fans shouldn’t
feel betrayed, though. Monkey
Island also contains plenty of
the good-time music for which
this band is best known. The
album’s best cuts in this
category are “Surrender” and
“So Good,”’ a couple of tunes
which you can’t just sit still and
listen to. In short, this record’s
got something for everyone,
from slow stuff to dancin’ music
to good old rock & roll. Highly
recommended.

Best of Styx
Styx
Wooden Nickel BWL1-2250
Don’t let the title fool you.
This album is definitely not the
best of Styx. It was released by
the band’s original label,
Wooden Nickel, in the hope of
cashing in on Styx’ recent suc-
cess at A&M. The only thing on
the album which most people
will recognize, in fact, is the
1974 platinum single “Lady.”
Still, if you’re into basics, no-
frills rock & roll, you'll pro-
bably enjoy this LP. Several
songs, particularly ‘‘Southern
Woman’’ and ‘‘Man of
Miracles,’’ rank among the best
rockers Styx has ever done, and
when it comes to straight-ahead
rock & roll, this band is better
than most. If you want thebest
of Styx, though, buy Equinox.

Hope
Klaatu
Capitol ST-11633

Remember Klaatu? They’re
the band that came out with the
mysterious debut LP that
sounded so Beatles-ish (in
places) that some people
thought in might actually be
John, Paul, George, and Ringo,
back together under a different
name. The group was finally
revealed to be, not the Beatles,
but a bunch of Toronto studio
musicians (no doubt a disap-
pointment to fans of the Fab
Four, but they can always start
another reunion rumor).

question nearly every day. The
answers are as varied as the

days, often conducted at lively
auctions where millions of
dollars are bid for the right to
turn hardback successes into
paperback fortunes.

has obviusly worked hard to
develop more of a sound of their

(’’We’re Off You Know’’) really
reminiscent of the Beatles, and
even it isn’t really that close.
The rest of the album contains
more complex, highly or-
chestrated songs that were to be
found on Klaatu’s first LP.
Musically, this band seems to
be able to do almost anything,
although some of their more
bizarre overdubs and _ intro
vocals can be annoying at times
(not to mention their lyrical
preoccupation with outer
space). More than anything,
though, Klaatu is quite talented
and (on this album) highly
original. An excellent bet if
you’re looking for something
different.

Davidson trounces
the Generals

by Pete Abitante

What happens when you allow
a team to run rampant for the
first quarter and a half of a foot-
ball game? They score 28
points, the margin of victory,
that’s what happens! If you
take away the first 19 minutes
of the Generals game with
Davidson College last Saturday,
W&L played a 14-14 tie. But add
the first quarter and the first
four minutes of the second
period and you will find that the
Wildcats went on to win their
first home game since 1974,
42-14.

Capitalizing early and often,
Davidson scored on _ four
straight possessions within the
opening 19 minutes. The first of
these came when Pete Legler
took a Syd Farrar punt and rac-
ed 83 yards for a score. David-
son recovered two General
fumbles on successive series
and drove 44 and 39 yards
respectively for two more
touchdowns. Farrar’ was
smothered while attempting to
punt on the next series, thus set-
ting up the Wildcats final score
of the disastrous’ span,
culminating on a one yard
plunge by fullback Page Walley
six plays later.

Six minutes into the second
period W&L scored its first
touchdown on a 6 yard run
around left end by freshman
Karl Cheatham. A Ted Hissey
pass to Richie Wiles completed
the two point conversion, mak-
ing the score 28-8 at the half.

Although the General’s
defense shut out Davidson in the
third period, the offense failed
to convert on two golden op-
portunities. Twice they had the

ball inside the Wildcat 10 yard
line but were unable to punch it
in, once being intercepted in the
end zone and the other time los-
ing the ball on downs.

While the defense could not
have looked better in the third
peiod, they could not have
played any worse in the first
half. A porous W&L front allow-
ed the Wildcats to amass a team
record 442 yards rushing on 68
carries. Add 68 yards passing,
and Davidson ran up an incredi-
ble 510 yards total offense. Pete
Legler led all rushers with 125
yards on 14 carries. In addition,
he returned two punts for 88
yards and one touchdown.

The Generals exhibited some
offensive spark though, mostly
on the passing of Ted Hissey
who was named offensive
player of the week. Hissey com-
pleted 16 of 25 passes for 173
yards while running for 26
more. W&L put together
several sustained drives as
evidenced by their total offense
production of 289 yards and
time of possession of nearly 29
minutes. Another bright spot
was the punting of Syd Farrar.
He punted four times for a 46.3
average, with a 60 yarder his
longest.

At this point in a yet young
season, it may seem that this is
the General team of old — in-
consistent offense, sporadic
defense and poor specialty-
team play. While definite
mistakes and lapses have been
made in these vital categories,
this team is not a ‘‘remnant”’ of
the past.

In their opening game of the
year, the Generals fared well
against Lock Haven State and

Dave William’s lone goal in
the first overtime of last Sun-
day’s match against Virginia
Wesleyan won the Va. Wesleyan
Tournament for the Generals
and gave them their best early
season record, 2-0, since 1969.
Coach Piranian was quick to
point out that he felt the most
significant factor in the team’s
victories was ‘team effort.’’
That may be true, but it’s also
been a long time since W&L’s

defense has played so well in
two consecutive games.

For the first game of the tour-
nament W&L faced Elon Col-
lege. Saturday’s contest saw the
Generals dominate every phase
of the game as the kickers
defeated Elon 5-0. W&L’s
scorers in the first game were
Dave Williams, Doug Dorsey,
Todd Tyson, Bill Stone, and
Shawn Levesque. All five points
were assisted. Sunday’s match

game. This past week, W&L
was outclassed by a_ well
disciplined wing-T division II
team from Davidson, North

Generals have gained valuable
experience which should prove
to be excellent preparation for
the remaining games.

This week the Generals face

will depend on an inconsistent,
suspect defense. With co-
captain Jeff Slatcoff ques-

Generals will have to play . in-
spired defense with a minimum

more of a contest. Virginia
Wesleyan, having practiced
longer than any of the other
teams in the tournament,
disposed of Roanoke by a score
of 3-1. Playing in familiar sur-
roundings with all too familiar
referees it is not surprising that
Va. Wesleyan pressured the
Generals during the entire
game. Some excellent goal-
keeping managed to hold Va.
Wesleyan scoreless, even
though they outshot the
Generals. In this match par-
ticularly the middies showed
signs of weariness, failining to
dominate play in the midfield as
they had done in the previous
contest.

Williams, a sophomore mid-
fielder, scored the winning goal
with two minutes remaining the
first of two ten minute overtime
periods. Tournament rules re-
quired that both overtime
periods be played. Williams
scored the winning goal from 20
yards out in a one on one situa-
tion with the Virginia Wesleyan
goalie. For Williams’ outstan-
ding play he was rewarded by
being named co-MVP of the Va.
Wesleyan Tournament.

But Piranian felt all along
that his team would prevail. He
said, ‘I expected to win. We
beat them soundly in an indoor
tournament last year. I’m sur-
prised they were as good as
they were.”

Piranian sees some very
positive signs in last weekend’s
victory. He cited the fact that
after two games the Generals
have had eight players involved
in scoring, compared to only
nine players for the entire ‘76
season. ‘‘Perhaps the most im-
portant asset,” says Piranian,
“is the fact that the players
believe in themselves. Last
year it seemed like everything
we did went wrong. These early
season wins give us the right at-
titude.”’

This Saturday’s away match
against Radford could be as dif-
ficult as the General’s match
against Va. Wesleyan. Rand-
ford is an erratic team, which
seems to raise the level of its
play to the calibre of its op-
ponents.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The liberal arts education, an idea developed and
cherished by the ancient scholars, died of an in-
curable illness: specialization.

Until recently, I probably would have still believed
in a liberal arts education and would have been sure it
existed at Washington and Lee. The unfortunate
tramas of drop-add have radically changed my opi-
nion.

My own experience coupled with similar tales from
fellow classmates has led me to the conclusion that
the liberal arts education discussed in the W&L
course catalog is only a facade for a traditional in-
stitution that is nothing more than a trade school.

Professors and advisors alike preach that the in-
famous concept of distribution credits is the basis for
a liberal arts education; however, prossibly they fail
to realize that these requirements are basically just
academically harder versions of high school
equivalents. Many students I’ve talked to, have ex-
pressed the opinion that they would go to great ex-
tents to be enrolled in more specialized, upper level
courses; however, they don’t have the time or room in
their tight academic schedules to be bothered by the
sometimes-trivial academic prerequisites.

Still others say the work load required for their ma-
jor leaves them without any time to take courses out-
side their chosen field of study. Others have reported
that they are willing to take a prerequisite course
with the intent of gaining the rewards of higher level,
more specialized courses, but the prerequisites
sometimes consist of either two courses or of one
course that lasts two semesters.

The professors claim the problem is overcrowding:
rumors state that 75 per cent of this year’s freshman
class will study in the Commerce School. The pro-
fessors claim extra students increases their work
load: they don’t mention the student’s work load. The
professors claim the quality of education is
hampered: possibly true, but without allowing truly
interested students—especially seniors in their
educational twilight—in these classes, the quality of
education for these upperclassmen will also be
hampered.

It is true that in many cases upper level courses and
professors skim over information learned by their
students from prerequisite courses—the courses un-
doubtedly must be retained to maintain a quality
education. But over the past four years, I’ve seen the
art of education become so defined that second
semester freshmen must practically declare their
majors so they can begin this specialization process.

Washington and Lee enjoys the reputation of being
a fine liberally educating school. Despite its political
conservatism and Wall Street walking population, it
just seems a shame that truly interested students are
unable to take advantage of this asset.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

 

Frats backed

To the editors:

It is my intention with this let-
ter to disagree with a few key
points submitted editorially
concerning fraternity rush in
the Sept. 16 issue. I am a
freshman, and I have already
pledged a fraternity, but this is
only half of my reasoning.

I feel that if rush was postpon-
ed until the winter term frater-
nities would have already
wooed the freshmen they con-
sidered ‘“‘sure things,” and
would wage a silent war for the
remaining 95 per cent of the
class. Each frat would par-
ticipate in a can-you-top-this
war, with a disasterous result.
So much money would be spent
on alcohol (even cokes) and
entertainment that the frats
would party themselves to
fiscal death, ruining the system
for everybody. Personally, I
was glad to get all the open
houses behind me before school
started. Two parties on Friday
night are OK too, but if we had
to start all the open houses in
winter, think how tired and
disgusted the frat members
would be, as well as the
freshmen, confronted with all
this mess in the heart of our
academic effort.

I attended ten open houses
and several unofficial house
parties, and I met hundreds of
people. I found the fraternity
for me--one that respects my
opinions, yet does not let a dif-
ference of opinion obstruct a
friendship. Let me submit that
the ‘facades’ of the frat
members are lifted after the
rushee becomes a pledge. I was
apprehensive at first, but I soon
learned that my frat is just as
courteous under no pressure as
they seemed to be when I was
rushed. I feel a survey of all
pledges in the various frater-
nities would support my
hypothesis. After three weeks of
intense soul-searching, one can
make an intelligent choice of
the fraternity which is right for
him. As far as I am concerned,
the pressure is off, and I can
begin serious concentration on
my studies. Would I be able to
do this in the middle of the
academic year? I think not.

Sincerely,
Sam H. Campbell, ’81

 

Phi, Goddard criticized

Editor:

As a member of both this
year’s and last year’s SAB, I
feel that I cannot leave the
allegations charged in last
week’s R.T.P. unchallenged.

I do not feel that it is the
policy of the Journalism depart-
ment of this school to create
prototypes of Watergate
reporters a la Woodward and
Bernstein. Certainly when a
student has a questionable
honor violation he does not rush
down to the Lexington News-
Gazette to let the entire com-
munity eavesdrop on the situa-
tion. He checks out the facts
before he brings them to the
proper authorities.

I am not saying that the issue
of alleged improprieties should
not have been investigated and
reported; it should have—
within proper bounds. One
should not accuse a student
group of “‘massive unauthoriz-
ed expenditures,”’ ‘‘mismanag-
ed money,” and “regular
private parties at student fund’s
expense’ without proper
documentation. I feel I must
charge Mr. Goddard with
reckless accusation without
proper documentation. The
RTP should also be criticized
for failure to cross-check Mr.
Goddard’s ‘informed source”’
and his ‘‘facts.””

The E.C. did investigate the

matter and substantiated one
charge, the housing loan to
Charles Hulfish by then co-
chairman John Berley. The
loan was between those two in-
dividuals and was not voted
upon nor approved by the SAB
as a body. Most members, in-
cluding myself, did not even
know about the loan. Both par-
ties admitted wrongdoing and
never tried to conceal the loan
at any time. That loan was
repaid with interest before the
RTP went to print and before
the E.C. began their investiga-
tion. None of the other claims of
“unauthorized disbursements
of money’”’ were substantiated.

It is hoped that this year’s
SAB will be cleared from the
mistakes of last year’s SAB,
alleged or otherwise. That the
SAB was guilty of poor or slop-
py bookkeeping is not to be
denied; that they be charged
with embezzlement by implica-
tion of distorted facts is another
matter altogether.

It is a serious thing to ques-
tion a man’s integrity based on
unfounded allegations. I hope
that the nature of the article
and allegations is not a reflec-
tion of the personal integrity of
Mr. Goddard or the staff of the
R.T.P.

Sincerely,
William B. Tucker ‘79
Co-chairman 1977-78 SAB

Undergrad “Untouchables”

accused by master race

Dear editor:

It is with deep regret that I
feel the need to write this letter.
I have been a student at this
university for over a year now,
and have been disappointed, to
say the very least, with the
school’s’ so-called ‘‘honor
code.’’ An incident last weekend
has upset me to the point that I
must express my views public-
ly.
Last Saturday night I parked
my green Pinto station wagon
on the road which bends around
the Woods Creek Apartments,
leading toward the site of the
new library. The next day two
of my classmates alerted me
that my car had been damaged.
And indeed it had been, after I
had parked it. The left rear
quarter panel was scraped and
pushed in, and the rear bumper
was bent, with one of the moun-
ting brackets nearly pulled out
from the body. No note or any
indication of who had hit me
was present. It was no small
dent.

The sad part is that I have
very little doubt that the acci-
dent was caused by an
undergraduate. The law school
student body is simply of a
higher caliber. One of my
classmates would have told me
that he had hit me, but not an
undergraduate. It is just
another example of the wanton
carelessness I have witnessed
on the part of the
undergraduate student body.
The law students are simply a
higher class of people. And
most of us never had any
‘“‘honor code’’ when we went to
college. My school, Albion Col-
lege (Mich.), did not have any

Editorial Note: Odd that you
should close your letter with the
word ‘‘disgusting.’’ This was

honor code, and I was not the
victim of a single theft or act of
v.ndalism in my four years
there. In little over a year in the
‘*Southern Gentlemen’s
school,’ I have had my car
damaged or vandalized twice,
had a textbook stolen and was
also involuntarily relieved of a
box which contained my stereo
speakers. (The speakers were,
fortunately, not in the box at the
time).

And what does the E.C. do
about such acts? I am not ask-
ing for any investigation, but
with the exception of the law
school representative (i.e. Rick
Goddard), this astute body
seems to content itself with
reprimanding students who get
drunk and steal $1.50 worth of
cheese from a local grocery
store. At the same time, the
E.C. does nothing to discourage
the reckless and immature
behavior which reached _ its
peak last year when a student
was sauteed by _ his

“gentlemen” friends at a
fraternity party. Absolutely
unbelievable’

The last part of this letter is
directed at the person who hit
my car. Come and tell me. You
won’t have to be put up against
the E.C. The honor code is not
my system. If you do come and
tell me, my regard for you per-
sonally and for the school in
general will be_ greatly
heightened.

I guess the moral of the story
is this: at Washington and Lee
boys will be boys, but men (and
capable women) will be law
students.

Disgustedly,
Daniel G. Beyer, ‘79

precisely our reaction upon
reading it, oh ye of higher
caliber...

Big stuff from Big Lex

by Ben W. Keesee

Being one of many naive,
idealistic, pristine and budding
geniuses referred to as
freshman, upon my arrival at
Washington and Lee this fall I
was faced with finding the
answers to many a festering
question. As most others, I
found the most pressing puzzle
to be: ‘‘What in the hell does
Ring-tum Phi mean? ‘‘Inspired
by curiosity, I began my quest
for the answer.

First, I stopped by the Ring-
tum Phi office. ‘‘Surely one of
the slick, sophisticated, omnis-
cient, pros of college newspaper
journalism can provide the

answers,” I thought. With a

trembling fist, I knocked meek-
ly upon the staff’s office door.
Bellowed from within came the
slightly less than hospitable
reply, ‘‘Screw this crapola, so-
meone see what that mother at
the door wants.”

As the door opened, I, com-
pletedly void of self-confidence,
half walked, half stumbled into
the room. In total awe of the
dramatic presence of true-to-
life editors, I said not a word.
My eyes first met those of a
bushy-haired, football type,
whom I recognized as_ the

Editor-in-Chief! Politely, with
exceptional understanding of
the lowly freshman’s plight, he
attempted to encourage my
speaking by musically
beseeching, ‘‘Whatever you
want, make it fast. We got work
to do.”’

Timidly I ventured, ‘Mr.
Editor, sir, could you please tell
me what the name of your
newspaper means?” In an-
ticipation of the shock of
recognition, I waited for his rep-
ly. The Editorials Editor, with
his jaw set and eyes fixed in-
tently on his page, asserted,
“What do we care, nobody
reads the damn thing any way?
Get out of here and leave us
alone!”

With stars in my eyes, blinded
by the brilliance of raw profes-
sionalism, I left the room.

I found myself intent on
distinquishing myself from the
thousands of other W&L
freshmen with journalistic
tendencies who vie to realize
their lifelong dream of winning
the lucrative position of— Assis-
tant Copy boy for the RtP.

My angle was this: find the
answer to a mystery greater
than that of the mighty

Lexington’s “SILVER”

Lining Remembered

by Ned McDonnell

In every city or town, there
are people who help make up its
character. Andrew Carnegie
certainly helped Pittsburgh at-
tain the dubious distinction of
being America’s “Smokey Ci-
ty.” Baron Van Haussmann
converted Paris from a dingy
medieval city to a spectacular
metropolis with wide
boulevards and breathtaking
panoramas. These men, for
their achievements, became
legends in their own time.

Although Lexington has had
more than its fair share of Con-
federate generals, no one has
had more impact on the
present-day character of this
community than Arthur Silver.
Yes, that’s right, Arthur Silver,
the elderly gentleman who
walks down the “Main’’ Street
he has grown to adore over the
last 52 years. Yes, the same Ar-
thur Silver who seems to know
something about everyone’s
hometown; a practical fringe
benefit of his earlier stage
career.

Arthur Silver, acclaimed a
living legend five times over the

years, yearns to remain in the -

public eye. He does an adequate
job of preserving his esteemed
status by singing love ballads,
cracking jokes, and occasional-
ly dropping in on fraternity par-
ties.

Silver has the past of a hustl-
ing comedian, the present of a
general bonvivant, and the
future of a mellowing legend.
Born in 1890 in Ohio, Silver look-
ed to show business for his
career. Starting at 15 singing
ragtime love ballads in a
Cleveland moving picture
showplace, Silver soon started
touring nationwide on _ the
vaudeville circuit. But around
1925, poisoned kidneys forced
Silver into the Johns Hopkins
Medical Center and out of show
business. After convalescing in
Lexington, the former actor
opened Arthur Silver’s Clothes
Shop.

“Big Art’? adapted to Lex-
ingtonians the hard way. One
day at a football game in 1928,
Arthur neglected to stand for a

_ rendition. of the. W&L .Swing.

After a smack on the head from
a drunk upperclassman mistak-
ing the taylor for an impudent
freshman, Silver learned the
Swing within a day. As Lex-
ington expanded from three
stores in the roaring 20’s, so did
Silver’s reputation as a comical
salesman of avant-garde
clothes ranging from the first

denims stocked in the area to .

the craziest hats in town.

Had Silver been able to sell
his comedy, he would have
made millions. But the hap-
piness of people’s laughter
satisfied him. Totally serene, at
least on the outside, and know-
ing each day was another day of
life, Silver managed to ascribe,
in the manner of John Donne,
sexual connotations to peanut
butter.

The happy-go-lucky haber-
dasher still has the sharp mind
of his younger days. Recently
the wives of two W&L students
entered his establishment with
an enframed “living lengend”’
article and asked him to explain
‘‘peanut butter legs.’’ Realizing
he shouldn’t tell the ladies the
truth, he deftly sidestepped the
quandary by saying that
‘‘peanut butter lets’’ belonged
to those women who were
pigeon-toed and who shuffled as
if they were walking in peanut
butter.

Two years ago, Arthur, en-
cumbered by sagging sales,
closed his store. Similar to the
fate of Packards, vintage
Bordeaux wines, and other
carefully crafted luxuries of
yesteryear, the popularity of
customed tailored clothing had
given way to cheaper mass-
produced clothes. Despite the
loss of his friendly service and
an antiquated concept of
clothing, the Arthur Silver of
half a century has remained.
Holding a condom in a clenched
fist and signing ‘‘He’s got the
whole world in his hand,”’ Silver
proves he’s still a pro at the
“‘art’’ he founded in Lexington;
blowing out young females.
Aside from the naughty jokes,
Arthur has all but monopolized
the Rockbridge area one liner
market. Silver brilliantly turn-
ed away an aggressive lady’s
question, ‘‘What is life without a

family?”” by snapping im-
pudently, ‘‘Quiet.”’

But the humor, the love and
faith in other people, the attach-
ment to Lexington, the serenity,
and the myriad of other
qualities that make him a
legend are fading in the old
man. Seriously contemplating
leaving Lexington, grimaces
slash across Art’s wisened face
when he thinks about the pre-
sent attitudinal state of the
American people. He feels that
Americans have become
‘“‘meaner”’ since the mid-1960’s.
Silver shudders at the extent to
which his compatriots ‘‘chase
the greenback’’; a psyche he
feels reflects the superficial
mentality of this country as it
enters it third century.

Lexingtonians who have not
had the fortune of meeting this
vast goldmine of experiences,
nostalgia, and advice may
dispute the validity of the legen-
dary proportions of Arthur
Silver. But those few of us who
have grown to know Silver,
have found this model of
earlier, less frenetic, more
sincere years that are lost
forever very refreshing indeed
pacifying as we face a highly
specialized and_ highly
pressurized world which may or
may not overwhelm us. If the
legend leaves, the legacy,
already engulfing Lexington
like an amoeba, of generosity
both material and spiritual will
permeate this town, the jokes
will still fly, and the strong 87-
year-old voice will still ring in
our ears. Lexington will still be
the same but will simultaneous-
ly lack something; something
indescribable that it once had.

ROTC events planned

While most of the student
body spent their summer bask-
ing in the sun or working at the
beach, ROTC students in the ad-
vanced program sweated it out
in the confines of Fort Bragg,
North Carolina. But now school
is back in session and the W&L
ROTC department is back to
fun and games with some new
events and a number of new
staff members.

Already members of ROTC
and a number of other students
have participated in the Slide-
For-Life and rappelling ac-
tivities offered by the depart-
ment. But the big event to date
was a canoe trip for novices
down the James River. And
there are plenty more offered
during the school year including
mountaineering and the annual
FTX. All of these activities are
open to the student body and
participation is encouraged.
Any inquiries should be
directed to Major Adams at
Ext. 242 or 463-4730

The department has a lot of
new faces since last year’s PMS
Col. McFadden, Major Kutter,
Captain Miller and Sgt. Wilson
have now left the staff. The new
PMS is LTC Davis with other
members of the staff including
Captain Long, MSG Johnson
and Captain Singleton.

On a note of accomplishment,
four W&L ROTC cadets suc-
cessfully completed training in
the prestigious Army Basic Air-

borne School, or as it is more
commonly known, jump school.
Freeman Jones (Junior), Mike
Cleary (Senior), Charles
Hulfish (Junior) and Wells
Goddin (Junior) took the exten-

summer: to become airborne
qualified and receive the

Big Brother wants you

There will be a mandatory
orientation meeting Tuesday,
Sept. 27 at 7:30 p.m. for anyone
interested in working for the
various University Federation
programs. The programs are:
Big brother/big sister, tutor-
ing, Western State, winter
clothing drive, cub scout pro-
gram and Reach-Out.
Psychology students are
reminded to attend if they want
to obtain extra credit from their
professors. Anyone unable to at-
tend should send a friend over
to sign up for him or contact
Rick Stein or Mark Broughton.
Stein is head of the U. F.

Broughton directs the big
brother program.

Here is a description of the
programs:

—Big Brother/big Sister:
The purpose of this program is
to help meet adequate attention
and caring. These children,
usually ranging in age from 9 to
18 are referred to the Federa-
tion by local schools or by agen-
cies, such as the Welfare and
the Probation Department.
After approval by the Big
Brother/Big Sister Board, the
volunteer is assigned to a child
or teenager whom he is to
meet on a regular basis. The
minimum commitment is that
the volunteer spend at least
three hours a week for the
academic year with his little
brother. It is helpful if the
volunteer has access to a car as
many volunteers choose to use
their time: helping the little
brother with his homework or
with learning a hobby or sport;
going on fishing trips, hiking, or
hunting trips; or attending local
sport events.

The Big Brother or Big Sister
receives supervision in his or

her work and meets periodical-
lv for consultation with others
in the program. Because of the
type children referred to this
program, this project is one of
the Federation’s most deman-
ding on the volunteer.

— Volunteer Work In The
School System (Tutoring): Ar-
rangements have been made
with the local elementary
schools for volunteers to assist
children who need extra help
with their schoolwork. The
schools, (Central, Waddell and
Lylburn Downing) are all in
walking distance of the W&L
campus.

The minimum commitment is
one hour a week for the
semester. The volunteer is not
expected to have any special
skills or knowledge except what
is expected of an _ entering
freshman. Teachers’ are
available to the volunteers to
help them in their work with the
children. However, the key to
the program is the type of rela-
tionship which the volunteer
develops with the children.
While most volunteers work
with individual children, there
are those often who want it to
take over part of a class. Last
year, this was the Federation’s
most popular program both
from the perspective of the
W&L volunteers and the
elementary school children.
—Western State-opportunity to
experience the complexities
and challenges of the Mental
Health field. Located in Staun-
ton, less than forty minute drive
from Lexington, Western State
is the State mental hospital for
this region of Virginia. It houses
a large variety of patients rang-
ing from those who have been
admitted on a short-term basis

mention an end of the year pic-
nic held for outgoing and incom-
ing SAB members. He said the
approximately $60 party for 30
people was the SAB’s way of
thanking its members for work-
ing so hard during the year. The
$60 did come out of SAB funds,
said Berley.

_ Concerning the records, Arm-
strong said they were filed in
triplicate: a copy to Washington
Hall, one to the E.C., and one
for the SAB’s files. He said that

it was obvious to him that God-
dard had not thoroughly check-
ed up on his sources before he
talked to the Phi.

Cappeto said that it was stan-
dard Washington and Lee pro-
cedure to keep only the
vouchers for record files. He
said technically speaking,
vouchers and receipts are not
the same thing, but here at
W&L the vouchers are used as
the receipts.

for tests and observations to
those hard-core patients who
have been hospitalized for a
long period of time.

The volunteer assumes a
minimum commitment to meet
once a week for three or four
hours with patients in the
hospital with the purpose of of-
fering them a degree of on going
support and companionship.
Each volunteer is given profes-
sional supervision in his work,
as well as opportunities for ad-
ditional work. Also, in some
cases, students enrolled in
Psychology courses can ar-
range to do some class projects
in conjunction with the pro-
gram.

Transporation is organized by,
car pools so that having a car is
not necessary to join the pro-
gram.

—Winter Clothing Drive:
Many children in the Lexington
and Rockbridge area lack suffi-
cient clothing, a situation which
becomes particularly apparent
during the winter months. As a
response, we seek to raise
money for these needy children.
Volunteers raise money
through special projects which
complement the general fund
raising drive during the fall
term. The names of the needy
children are provided by the
local Welfare Department and
the Board of Education. Not all
the recipients are member of
“welfare” families as some of
the most critical cases concern
children whose parents are not
on welfare, but who, never-
theless, are too poor to clothe
their children. There is no par-
ticular commitment except the
determination to raise money
for the project.

—In the  Lexington-
Rockbridge County area there
are approximately five Cub
Scout dens. In these dens the
den mothers are over crowded
as there are usually nine or ten
boys per den mother. The W&L
student’s job is to help her coor-
dinate programs and set up ac-
tivities for these boys. The den
mothers encourage you to ex-
press and use your imagination
for the various planned ac-
tivities. There is one meeting
per week and it is about an hour
and a half long.

—Reach-Out: A _ program
directed by Dr. Worth involving
crisis counseling over the
phone. Please contact Dr.
Worth for further information.

All the programs, except the
Big Brother program, require
commitment for the entire
year. Big Brother requires a
commitment of a full school
year.

pyramids, more enigmatic than

ding the ill-effects of premature
matriculation! Find the origin
of themast-head Ring-tum Phi!
To accomplish this deed would
not only satisfy my personal in-
quiry, but also shoot me into the
top one hundred applicants be-
ing considered for a RtP job!
Pen and memo book in hand, I

marched to the library in’

search of my Holy Grail. To my
eventual surprise and delight,
aided by the efforts of two
devastatingly beautiful and
equally sensuous librarians, I
found a lead. I was immediately
off to the archives of majestic
McCormick. Deep into the dark,
cavernous bowels I climbed,
waiving away cobwebs with one
hand and the amorous
librarians with the other until at
last I found them. There among
the rats and the choking dust

lay the Lost Sea Scrolls of -

Washington and Lee, volumes 2
and 11 of the ‘Alumni
Magazine.”

After putting on the kid gloves
handed me by one of the
librarians, I removed the
volumes, dried and yellowed
with age, to the reference room
where lighting was more
suitable. And after hours and
days of tireless reading,
research, and note taking, I
have developed the first
authoritative source explaining
concisely, in 18 volumes, the
origin of the name Ring-tum
Phi.

After a quick trip to Jiffy
Publishing and Printing, I
returned once again to the RtP
office, this time with my
masterpiece. Volumes under
arm, I pounded upon the door,
giving no time for reply, I
entered the room as the ex-
plorer returning to his queen
with the news of plentiful new
lands discovered in her name
and honor. ‘‘Here is the answer,
the light, the word!”’ I shouted.
After reading the volumes. the
editors fell to their knees, ex-
tolling my supreme and
ultimate power over the
English language and the writ-
ten word, pledging their infinite
effort and service to my will.
Humbly I bid them to stand and
as a gesture of my unique kind-
ness and nobleness, assured
each one he could maintain his
position of lowliness in ex-
change for my being appointed
to the coveted post of Intermit-
tent Freshman Correspondent.
After a lavish but tastefully
brief ceremony, I made my ex-

it, crowned in a gray felt hat
with an attached card upon
which was emblazoned the
magic word “Press.” The
Editor-in-Chief then showed me
to my private news office fur-
nished with bar, waterbed and
librarians. I now live happily
forever after.

And for those of you who have
lasted through the brief in-
troduction to this news story, I
will summarize, briefly, my fin-
dings from the exhaustive study
I conducted.

The practical origin of the
phrase Ring-tum Phi is a
derivative of an ancient couplet
passed off as a football cheer at
athletic events by various
mellow fellows of W&L. The
cheer went as follows:

‘“Ring-tum Phi, Stickeri Bum,
We’re Hot Stuff From Lex-

ington!”

The newspaper adopted this
initial phrase, according to
some, after publishing several
heated editorial opinions which
resulted in major University
changes. This was a first in col-
lege journalism. Thus, the staff
found the phrase and it’s in-
ference an appropriate title.

The literal translation of the

phrase has been interpreted in
several different ways. The
most popular by far according
to classical scholars is this:
Ring is derivative of the Latin
verb ringo, meaning to snarl or
show one’s teeth or fangs. Ran-
dom House dictionary defines
the word tum as a verb, mean-
ing to tease, as applicable to
wool. And of course, the word
phi represents the twenty-first
letter of the Greek alphabet.
The combination of all these
meanings must mean one and
only one thing. The phrase at
the top of the Ring-tum Phi is a
disclaimer warning:
‘‘Although we like to snarl and
show our fangs, don’t let us
pull the wool over your eyes
with our teases. Acutally, we
can’t get past the twenty-first
letter of the alphabet!”’

A more detailed tracing, ac-
count, and description is
available in my complete work,
now on display at the Smithso-
nian Institute of Verbosity.
