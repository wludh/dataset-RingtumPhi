74 bad checks outstanding

Cold Check Coiniites has $713 in

bounced student checks

The Cold Check Committee
has 74 bad student checks
amounting to $713.96 in its
possession, according to com-
mittee treasurer Jim Frantz,

Committee chairman Andrew
Sanders called the situation the
‘spring rush.’ ‘‘Judging from
past experience, I am_ op-
timistic that we can recover
most of the checks,’ he said.

“this is not an abnormal
amount ($713) for this time of
year. We were in the same
situation last year,’’ Sanders
said.

Frantz reported that the com-
mittee has handled 250 checks
this year amounting to $901.56,
not counting the 74 outstanding
checks.

The purpose of the Cold Check
Committee is to safeguard the
right of Washington and Lee

students to write checks to mer-
chants in town. The committee
picks up and pays merchants
for the ‘‘bounced”’ checks, then
calls in students for an explana-
tion and reinbursement for the
checks.

Sanders attributed ‘‘the
massive flow’’ of bad checks to
his committee this spring as a
result of many students running
out of money at the end of the
year.

With only two weeks remain-
ing before graduation, Sanders
said his committee ‘‘will try to
have two meetings next week”’
to account for the outstanding
checks and be reinbursed for
their amount before summer
vacation.

“We'll have to rely on the
committee members to run peo-
ple down,”’ Sanders said, but he

noted that his committee is cur-

rently short on manpower.
Seniors who leave school with
checks still in the possession of
the Cold Check Committee will
have their transcripts frozen

until they: make their checks ©

good, Sanders said.

The committee has the
authority to levy a fine of up to
$5 for the first offense, $10 for
the second offense, and $15 for a
third appearance before the
committee. Frantz said that as
of yesterday $86 had been col-
lected from 40 students in fines
for bad checks this year.

“A lot of students bounce
checks and its not their fault,”
Sanders said. ‘‘Or a
mathematical error has caused
a miscalculation on their part.”’

Med. School Acceptances Down

by Randy Smith

Two weeks before
Washington and Lee’s gradua-
tion ceremonies, only five of 20
seniors applying to medical
school have been accepted.
Five other applicants are on the
waiting list at medical schools.

Last year at this time, 19 out
of 38 seniors who applied to
medical school had been ac-
cepted, or 50 percent. Three
students were on the waiting
list; all were accepted after
graduation.

A number of sophomore and
junior undergraduate pre-med
students have expressed con-
cern about the current situation
because two of the five seniors
on the waiting list are Phi Beta
Kappa scholars.

Much mud, slung

John Sacco, one of the Phi
Beta Kappas, says ‘‘the pro-
blem is not as great as it seems.
It’s still early.’’ Sacco pointed
out that some medical schools
accept students up to a week
before classes begin.

The final figure for 1977, as
reported by the biology depart-
ment, is that 29 out of 47 ap-
plicants to medical schools
were accepted (W&L
graduates who reapply are
counted in with the senior
class). The biology department
figure raises the medical school
acceptance rate to 61.7 percent
for that year.

This year, the biology depart-
ment reports the acceptance
figure as 10 out of 25, or 40 per-
cent. Five of the 10 accepted are

Muckrakers vs. Gondoliers

The Ring-tum Phi found out
today that top. salaried
superstar Pete Goss will not
play for the Muckrakers in Fri-
day’s contest against the WLUR
Gondoliers. It is rumored that
Gondolier coach Bob deMaria
offered Goss plenty of bucks not
to play in the game between the
two rivals. It is believed by in-
siders that since Goss was not
going to receive a salary as
business manager of the RtP
this year, he readily accepted
deMaria’s offer.

The Muckraker-Gondolier
softball contest is a grudge
match initiated by the WLUR
staff against the RtP’s group of
high quality journalists. Realiz-
ing the Gondoliers could not
outreport the Muckrakers,
deMaria sought his revenge by
challenging Muckraker player-
coach Mike Gallagher’s team.

‘“‘We’rea gonna show thosea
hot shots. Ifa they can’ta play
fair in the news business, wea
won’t playa fair on the softball
field,” said deMaria.

Gallagher apparently ex-
pected such a statement from
deMaria. “I don’t expect that
dago to play fair. He never has.
His team isn’t even comprised
of journalists. They are mostly
his associates from the Friends
of Italy Lodge, Buena Vista
Chapter Number 33. Ask Mark
Mainwaring, their program
director, if you don’t believe
me.”

Mainwaring confirmed this.
‘Most of our guys are enrolled
in Journalism 140 and don’t
know a thing about journalism.
DeMaria just picked them up
off th- street and signed them up
for his course in hopes of

seniors. Dental and veterinary
students are included in the
medical achool acceptance
number.

(The biology department’s
acceptance figure for 1976 is
70.4 percent of those students
ana graduates who applied. )

U.C. elections

continue
today

Monday’s University Council
election produced only two
distinct winners, neither of
whom were on the ballot.

Jeff Bartlett and Tim Brooks
won the two openings for junior
representatives to the U.C. Both
were write-in candidates. No
rising juniors had submitted
their names to the Executive
Committee for the U.C. spots
before the election.

The crowded fields in the
other two academic classed re-
mained crowded for today’s
run-off election.

On Monday, John Boatwright
(with 46 votes), Edward Mintz
(39), Bob Mullican (62), and Joe
Robles (46) stayed in contention
for the two openings for U.C.
sophomore representatives.
Warren Kean (29) and Madison
Woodward (19) were dropped
from today’s run-off.

To fill the two senior
representative positions on next
year’s University Council, six
current juniors remained in the
running: Monk Hamra (39),
Doug Lane (35), Rob Atkinson
(28), Doug Adams (22), Pete
Williams (23), and Doug Byrd
(21). Preston Waldrop (15) was
the only candidate removed
from the ballot.

Senator Sam Ervin

Senator Sam Ervin:
resisting temptation

Former Senator Sam Ervin
told a Washington and Lee au-
dience Tuesday night that
politicians often succumb to
three temptations: ‘‘a love for
money, a lust for power, and
choosing between what is right
and what is politically expe-
dient.”

Speaking before a_ large
crowd in Lee Chapel, Ervin
mixed ‘“‘down-home’”’ homilies
with advice as he spoke on
political ethics and national af-
fairs.

Ervin gained national pro-
minance as chairman of the
Select Senate Committed on
Watergate. He said during
questioning that Richard Nixon
was guilty of obstruction of
justice and conspiracy to
obstruct justice.

Ervin also said that although
he has only thumbed through
the former _president’s
memoirs, he thinks that Nixon
may have borrowed a phrase
from Mark Twain in writing it:

“The truth is very precious, so
use it sparingly.”

Ervin joked that a friend had
commented to him upon learn-
ing that the subject of his
speech was to be political
ethics. that ‘“‘it will be a short
speech, because there isn’t
anything to say.”’

He said that people have lost
“confident in their govern-
ment, politicians and the
political process....Whenever,
men or women decide to have
nothing to do with politics, then
we are all condemned to live
under a bad government.”

Ervin said that although
there are such temptations on
politicians, ‘‘the majority do not
succumb to evil for mercenary
gains.”

Ervin explained that he found
it helpful to resist the tempta-
tions by anchoring himself
down with a verse or a poem.

“T -have to live with myself
and so

Are concerts worth the
expense and trouble?

by David Blackwood

The Student Activities Board
announced a loss of $8,040 from
last Thursday night’s Harry
Chapin concert.

Although the crowd of ap-
proximately 500 students did
not seem to notice, there were
numerous last minute com-
plications in producing the
show.

To begin with, the supervisor
from the promotional company
was a no-show. Normally, it
would be his responsibility to
iron out any problems between
the band and the school. As it
was, he missed a busy day.
First of all, it was discovered
the the band’s grand piano and
a set of stage lights were in a
truck somewhere near

Washington, too far away to ar-
rive in time for the concert.
This problem was complicated
by the late arrival of two
members of the band who had
taken a late flight from New
York.

When the duo finally made
their appearance, one was
found to have lost his instru-
ment, a cello, to an airline
strike. Until Dr. Knudson
graciously lent his cello, the
band played shorthanded.

Sunday’s festivities at the
Pavillion were also a challenge
to arrange. Through the course
of the week, three bands
cancelled one after another.
Finally a band, Thunderchief,
was found at 7 a.m. Sunday

Next Year’s E.C.
Takes The Initiative

Budget
Guidlines

Finalized

Next year’s Executive Com-
mittee has already taken steps
to insure that proper budgeting
procedures are adhered to.

Budgets to be submitted to
the E.C. by subcommittee
chairmen and treasurers in
September ‘‘should be as detail-
ed andas itemized as possible.”

In addition, the E.C. wil re-
quire ‘written monthly reports
on committee activities,’ said
next year’s student body presi-
dent Bo Dudley in a letter to all
newly appointed subcommittee
chairmen. The reports will in-
clude planned activities for the
upcoming month, a financial
statement, and a report on the
acivities of the committee in the
preceding month.

Dudley also said that a year-
end financial statement will be
required of each subcommittee,
to be submitted in May 1979.

 

 

“Views of W&L”

on display in bookstore

“Views of Washington and
Lee and Virginia Military In-
stitute,’ a collection of prints,
etchings and dry-point engrav-
ings, will be on display at the
Washington and Lee University
Bookstore through June 7.

The exhibit features prints by
I-Hsiung Ju, associate pro-
fessor of art and_artist-in-
residence at W&L, and Turner
McGehee, a 1975 graduate of
W&L who has studied under Ju

since his graduation.

All of McGehee’s prints are
color serigraphical, or silk-
screen processed. Ju’s prints
are a combination of silk-
screens, etchings and dry-point
engravings. The dry-point
engravings are made by using a
fine needle to etch intricate
lines on a metal plate without
the use of acid.

The bookstore is open
weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30
p.m.

Soul, Rock, or neither

(continued from page 1)

morning.

As it turned out, Thunderchief
and the Second Hand Band
played to nearly 600 bear chugg-
ing, hot dog consuming
students. The results were 16
empty kegs and 15 digested
weenies.

Although the results of the
event seemed pleasurable to
those who attended, there were
some questions raised as to
whether Washington and Lee
can effectively put on a big con-
cert.

The SAB runs into a number
of problems .in putting on a
show. Because pressure from
the student body is always pre-
sent, the SAB has to try to ob-
tain entertainment that will ap-
peal to a majority of students.

Harry Chapin was neither
soul nor rock but, unfortunate-
ly, only appealed to a small
number of students.

Even after a band has been
selected, there is a good chance
that the group will break its
contract. Washington and Lee is
not along a major concert tour
and, thus, is often dropped when
a more convenient location is
convenient location is found.

 

“Harry Chapin was neither
soul nor rock but, un-
fortunately, only appealed
to a small number of
students.”

 

The bands feel free to do this
because they know it is not
worth our while to take them to
court. Even if we could force a
contract-breaking band to keep
their date, there is no guarantee
that the band would not seek
musical vengeance through a
bad concert.

Pub. Board - E.C.
showdown tabled

In a meeting called to discuss

the status of the Ring-tum Phi,

the Executive Committee failed
to achieve a quorum. Several
problems were _ solved,
however, clearing the way for
publication of this week’s
paper.

Last week, after the Ex-
ecutive Committee overruled
the Publications Board’s deci-
sion to fire the editor, J.
Michael Gallagher, the board
refused to publish any more
issues of the Ring-tum Phi. Ina
statement posted on campus,
the Publications Board said,
“The Board cannot accept
responsibility for publications
for which it is not an
authoritative body. Until this
matter is resolved, the publica-

 

Automatic

AUTOMATIC RULE

The Committee on _ the
Automatic Rule will meet at
10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, June 6,
1978. At that time the Commit-
tee will consider whether or not
to reinstate immediately the
following groups of students
who have fallen under the
Automatic Rule:

1. those students completing a
full academic year who failed to
meet the cumulative average
required of their class;

2. those students not com-
pleting a full academic year
who failed to meet the condi-
tions of Academic Probation re-
quired of them by the end of the
current Spring Term.

The committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement
all students who fall under the
Automatic Rule. If any student
wishes to inform the Committee
of any extenuating cir-
cumstances, he may write a let-
ter to the Committee and
deliver it to the Office of the
Dean of the College before June
6.

A student who falls under the
Automatic Rule severs his con-
nection with the University. If
the Committee does not grant
him immediate reinstatement
(reinstatement is the exception
rather than the rule), he may
apply for reinstatement after a

Rule and Academic Pro

minimum of one year. As soon
as possible after the Commit-
tee’s meeting, each student fall-
ing under the Automatic Rule
will receive a letter explaining
his status. His parents will
receive a copy of that letter.

ACADEMIC PROBATION

Any student who is not sub-
ject to the Automatic Rule in
June (one who has not com
pleted a full year then) and who
fails to achieve the cumulative
average required for his class
will be on Academic Probation
for the Fall Term. He and his
parents will be notified of his
status.

tion of the Ring-tum Phi shall
cease...” Following this deci-
sion, however, the E.C.,
through its own authority, per-
mitted the publication of the
paper. E.C. President Jim
Underhill said at the Tuesday
meeting that he had only plann-
ed to underwrite one issue of
theRing-tum Phi to allow the
E.C. enough time to resolve the
matter. The Publications Board
solved the problem of financing
this week’s edition of the Phi
when it indicated its willingness
to make up the difference bet-
ween advertising revenue and
production costs. The Pub
Board members said they were
willing to take financial respon-
sibility for the paper, but not the
publishing responsibility. The
Executive Committee will con-
sider the matter further after
its regularly scheduled meeting
on Monday.

Finally, there is the problem
of guaging student attendance.
Soul concerts are heavily oppos-
ed while rock concerts are bad-
ly attended.

Harry Chapin now proves
that a group in_ neither
category, rock nor soul, is also
rejected by the student body.
Bill Tucker, chairman of the
SAB, had predicted 1,000 to
1,200 students to attend the
Chapin:concert, but only half
that number did so.

To Tucker, the only alter-
native left is for a Southern
‘boogie’ band. Indeed, there
was an effort to get the Outlaws
and Sea Level, but the deal fell
through when both bands were
offered a more attractive offer.

Despite the low attendance
record at big concerts, the SAB
plans to continue its attempts at
big name entertainment. The
feeling seems to be that the ef-
fort is worth the pain.

Cockpit presents Glenn
Phillips this weekend

Glenn Phillips is just back
from an astoundingly  suc-
cessful twenty-week tour of
England. During °77 Phillips’
last two records stayed con-
sistently in the top five of all
British import LP’s. The Glenn
Phillips group is coming up
from Atlanta and will play in
the Cockpit the Friday and
Saturday. Terrific, huh?

WHO IS GLENN PHILLIPS?

Reviews of his past albums
have included references to Jeft
Beck, Jimmy Page, Jimi Hen-
drix, Carlos Santana, John
McLaughlin, Mike Oldfield,
Frank Zappa, and many others
when describing his artistry on
the guitar.

YES, BUT WHO IS GLENN
PHILLIPS?

. The person who might answer
that question best would be
Glenn himself. The following is
an exerpt from some copy
Glenn Phillips wrote last sum-
mer to help promote his English
tour: ‘‘Glenn Phillips started
playing guitar when he was six-
teen. He jammed to blues
records in Atlanta. One year
later he formed the Hampton
Grease Band with Bruce Hamp-
ton. He couldn’t play much.
“The Hampton Grease Band
lasted six years. In that time it
supported Alice Cooper in New
Jersey, the Mothers at the
Fillmore East, Three Dog Night
in Alabama, Fleetwood Mac
and the Grateful Dead in Atlan-
ta, B.B. King and John Mayall

“Little Mary” is hokey,

by Melissa Nelson
and J. Michael Gallagher

From the opening piano duet
to the closing number, you are
glad you were there, you are
glad it is over, but you don’t
know why. Little Mary Sun-
shine is a spoof of the
melodrama, especially the
Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. If
you can't remember how
‘hokey’? Gilbert and Sullivan
could be, Mary Sunshine will re-
mind you.

The play is complete with its

Dudley Do-Right and Nell, and
Dick Dasterdly, and the ill-
fated story which, of course,
has a happy ending. It is set in
Colorado where Mary Sunshine
is running an inn for bacheloret-
tes, and occasionally a few
male visitors.

The women in the play are
portrayed as the typical. hus-
band hunting females (aren’t
we all), and the males are out
for all they can get (of course).

The story opens with the ar-
rival of “Big Jim,’’(alias
Dudley Do-Right), and
company—the Forest Rangers.
A group of young ladies from
Eastchester Finishing School
just happen to be arriving at the
inn that day, too.

Both groups long for
members of the opposite sex,
find each other, and, of course,
fall in love.

But everything is not hap-
piness and sunshine; clouds ap-
pear on the horizon: the villain,
Yellow Feather. At that point,
the men are forced to leave the
ladies to ensure that justice
prevails.

After repeated choruses of
‘‘Look for a sky of blue,’’ you’re

remember. Usually the au-
dience would throw things, the
other half would scream for
more. I mean really scream.
“At a 1970 Atlanta pop
festival, Glenn and the band
played before Columbia
records. They were signed.
They made a double album
‘Music to Eat’ as their recor-
ding debut. Then Columbia
fired them. In 1972, Bruce
Hampton left town (Atlanta).
The Hampton Grease Band split
up. Glenn and the former drum-

’ mer Jerry Fields formed Stump

Brothers. Later that year,
Stump Brothers supported Lit-
tle Feat at the Twelfth Gate,
Atlanta. Lowell George took one
look at Glenn Phillips and said,

reminded that things have to
get better, because in stories
like this, they always do. Sure
enough, the men return, justice
has been done, and everyone
will live happily ever after.

The actors of Little Mary Sun-
shine did a good job with what
could have turned out as an
overdone satire. David Sorrells
did an adequate job with ‘Capt.
‘Big Jim’ Warington’’, although
he needs to loosen up on stage
when he is not delivering a line.

Last Thursday night, despite
the small crowd (490 tickets
were sold at last count), despite
the piano from the Cockpit in-
stead of a grand, and despite
the celloist’s cello being held up
in a Northwestern airlines
strike, Harry Chapin and his
band played.

The concert, which was
scheduled for 8 p.m., did not
start until 8:45 p.m.,and it was
another forty-five minutes or so
before the celloist showed up to
complete the band (after
wandering around campus try-
ing to borrow a cello). The con-
cert started with Chapin doing a
few numbers by himself, one of
them a relatively new song
“Dancing Boy;’’ a nice sen-
timental song about his son, but
also rather dull. Then his band
(one of his stronger points) con-
sisting of brother Steve on the
piano, a bassist, lead guitarist,
drummer, and celloist, ap-
peared on stage amidst an ex-
tremely well-done light-show.
Throughout the concert it
became evident, as had been
assumed, that Chapin himself is
probably less able than his col-

Chapin entertains
scocccccooccen, SIMA! crowd of 500

leagues as far as guitar playing
ability goes. He is, however, a
very talented songwriter (he
writes his own material) and
the crowd enjoyed his songs.
The band sounded very good
together, expecially on a jaz-
zrock workout of a song entitled
“*Sniper.”’

According to Bill Tucker of
the SAB, the Activities Board
took an $8,000 loss on the con-
cert. Tucker said, ‘We
budgeted the concert for a
$6,000 loss, so it was about what
we expected.” Tucker also
stated that this was the normal
loss on a concert.

Although Chapin’s musical
ability is rather mediocre at
times, he is the classic
showman, and this, above
everything else, is what makes
a Chapin concert so worthwhile.
He knows how to handle an au-
dience by telling jokes and
stories and poking fun at the au-
dience as well as at himself. All-
in-all, it was a good concert, and
well worth the four dollar ad-
mission charge. But even more,
it was certainly a refreshing
change from the Spinners and
Archie Bell and the Drells.

RING-TUM PHI

Tennis Team Ends Season;

Playoffs Ahead

by Mike Farrand
Rain muddied the end of the
tennis team’s 1978 regular
season but they managed to
play one and a half matches and
finish with a record of 9-11.

Tuesday against Salisbury
State the Generals were vic-
torious 4-3 in a match that end-
ed early due to rain. At An-
napolis the next day, W&L’s
netmen met the Naval
Academy's Midshipmen and
vot torpedoed 8-1; only Johns-
Jackson won in doubles. The
match with Emory and Henry
for last Saturday was cancelled
because of rain.

Ben Johns, Stewart Jackson,
Cody Davis, Doug Gaker, and
Pat Norris are noticeably ab-
sent from campus this week
because they are in Delaware,
Ohio trying to win the national
Division II] championship for
W&L. Four singles players and
two doubles teams, consisting
of Ben Johns-Stewart Jackson

and Cody Davis-Pat Norris,
make up the Generals’ fighting
force in Ohio. Last season the
netment came home from the
national tournament as
America’s number two team,
tying with ClaremontMudd and
losing to Swarthmore. This
year, however, the Generals
are favored.

After playing Division I
teams of high stature all year
the team should be well tuned.
Tennis U.S.A. thinks so at least
and named W&L the top team,
Claremont-Mudd, Kalamazoo,
and Swarthmore following in
order. The double duo of Johns
and Jackson looks particularly
strong and may repeat their na-
tional doubles championship of
last year and once again be
named All-Americans. Pat Nor-
ris and Cody Davis as a team
have also performed well this
year. The tournament runs
from May 17-20 and chances are
good that the Generals will
return as national champions
on Saturday.

Maatman Goes To Nationals

Senior captain Jerry Maat-
man will be the lone W&L
representative participating in
the 1978 Division III national
golf championships being held
May 23-26 at Wooster, Ohio.

The Wilmette, Ill. native
finished sixth individually last
year in being accorded All-
American honors, W&L’s first
ever in golf. The Generals were
selected as a team in 1977 and
finished seventh nationally.
Coach Buck Leslie was visably
dissappointed upon learning

Awards
Banquet

Announced

The 1978 Washington and Lee
All Sports Award Barbeque will
be held on Tuesday, May 23
beginning at 5:00 PM on W&L’s
Wilson Field. In the event of in-
clement weather, the award
ceremony will be held in W&L's
Warner Center.

Three special awards will be
presented at that time including
the Preston K. Brown Memorial
Award to the University’s Most
Valuable Athlete in 1977-78. Also
presented will be the Mink
Glasgow Spirit and Sportsman-
ship Award and the Outstanding
Freshman Athlete Award. Each
intercollegiate sport will pre-
sent its two major awards at the
barbeque as will the W&L in-
tramural program.

 

that nis team was not selected
as a group this season.

Only two schools from
District III were selected and
W&L was not one of them. Con-
sidering the fact that the
Generals are currently 8-0 with
only Thursday’s match at
Roanoke remaining, Leslie has
reason for his dissappointment.

The team was idle last week
and concludes the 1978 year on
Thursday playing the Maroons
in an ODAC match. W&L
defeated Roanoke 392-397
earlier inthe month.

Lacrosse Team Ends Season

With 12-2 Loss At Cornell

Unable to dent the net of Cor-
nell goalie John Griffin,
Washington and Lee’s Lacrosse
Generals saw their season come
to a close by a 12-2 score yester-
day at Schoellkopf Field in the
quarterfinal round of the NCAA
University Division Playoffs.
Although ranked ninth in the
final USILA poll of the season
following last Saturday’s 12-6
disaster at the hands of Hofstra,
W&L still gained a Playoff bid
for the seventh straight year.

 

and were pitted against the Big
Red of Cornell, owners of a 40-
game winning season which
spans three seasons.

Cornell lengthened this winn-
ing streak yesterday at W&L’s
Expense, shutting out the
Generals for the first 36 minutes
of the game while pumping
eight shots by goalie Charlie
Brown.

The eight goal deficit could
not be made up by the W&L
sticman who went after Cornell
aggressively at the game’s
outset. Brownwas successful at
first in stopping the Big Red at-
tack and clearing the ballto his
teammates. On offense, John
Kemp narrowly missed two
goals, one hitting a pipe.

The Generals were seeded

   

eighth for the post seasonaffair,

track,with Craig Jaeger feeding
BobHendrickson twice within a
minute as Cornell took a 2-0
lead.

Jaeger then won the ensuing
faceoff, raced toward W&L’s
goal, and fired in Cornell's third
goal of the game. By the end of
the first quarter, the Generals
had outshot the Big Red 9-8 but
were losing 4-0. ‘

Griffin held tough against the
Generels in period number two,
stoppingpoint blank shots by
Johnny Black. Sandy McDonald

    
 

found the nets four times, two
on assists by Steve Page, and
the difference at halftime was
8-0.

W&L played tough defense in
the third quarter, allowing only
one score,but Griffen was
outstanding for Cornell and the
Generals beat him only once.
That goal came at the 8:14
mark off of John Kemp’s stick.
It was the first goal W&L has
scored on Cornell in the last
seven quarters ofof play bet-
ween the two teams.

Jay Foster made it 9-2 early
in the fourth quarter but it was
too late by this time.

While Cornell's goalie
thwarted the Generals yester-
day, it was the zone defense of
Hofstra thatsent the Generals

Bussard

Dennis R._ Bussard,
Washington and Lee’s tennis
coach and assistant basketball
coach, has resigned his _posi-
tions to accept the head basket-
ball coaching job at Babson Col-
lege in Wellesly Massachuset.
In addition to being head
basketball coach at Babson,
Bussard will also be Assistant
Athletic Director.

As head tennis coach at W&L,

had another pipe shot. Cornell

reeling on Saturday.

The Flying Dutchman con-
trolled the tempo of the contest
and outshot W&L 53-33, in gain-
ing the victory that earned
Hofstra a place in the NCAA
tournament.

Hofstra’s Paul Sanit had
sevensaves in the contest while
brown stopped 13 shots. W&L’s
attack duo of Black and Jeff
Fritz had three goals and. five
assists between them.

The Generals finished the up-
and-down vear with a record of

re ale .

9-5 and a ranking of ninth in the

nation. Although W&L will

sorely miss the efforts of the

five graduating seniors, xt
years prospects lookbright.

The Generals young midfield
and defense will be a year older
and a year more experienced.
Black and Fritz will botth be
seniors, and they-will be joined
by Chris Kearney, W&L’s big-
gest gun last year who decided
to take a .year off. Bob
Clements, an All-American
goalie in highschool, should be
able to fill the shoes of Brown
for the next two seasons.

 
    

resigns

Bussard has received Coach of
the Year honors for the past
four years, with the last two
years being ODAC honors. The
tennis team this year, as was
the case last year, were ODAC
champs. This year thetennis
team was ranked number one in
Division III, and are currently
playing in the Nationals in
Delaware, Ohio.

No successor for Bussard has
been named.

‘He is the most amazing

‘‘Lowell George took tapes of
the band to Warner Brothers.
They loved them. The deal fell
through. Jerry Fields left town
(Atlanta). Bass player Mike
Holbrook left town (Atlanta). It
was late 1972. In early 1973,
Glenn Michael Phillips’s father
committed suicide. Now there
was no Hampton Grease Band.
There was no Stump Brothers.
There was even no Mr. Phillips.
His father was dead. There was
just Glenn. Two years later, in
February 1975, ‘Lost at Sea’
was released in Atlanta on
Glenn’s own label. It was
greeted with wild acclaim...
‘There is in America a highly

The Phi has discovered that
deMaria has used money in the
past to lure free agents away
from the Muckrakers’ team.
Dave Abrams, Ben Keesee, and
Sandy Bishop have jumped
from the Muckrakers to the
Gondoliers. Though Gallagher
maintains they were fired, he
admitted that the three just
were not dedicated enough jour-
nalists for him. “They don’t
know what real muck is.”’

Las Vegas odds on the game
are 6-2 Muckrakers. Newark
odds are 5-4 in favor of the Gon-
doliers, and Washington Hall,
as it has in the past, has picked
the Muckrakers to fail in their
attempt against the Gondoliers.

Not much is left to report

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

IT'S GOOD To KNOW I'M TAKING

PRE-MED COURSES WITH ONLY
A add, (CHANCE OF GETTING

Year end praises

No sour grapes, Bill, you are an alright guy. For
once you did something to deserve praise. It took guts
to put ona concert you knew was going to lose money.

The money loss was worth it. The concert was good.
Chapin may be the best performer to appear at
Washington and Lee ever. . Even though $8000 was
lost, it is better to lose money and put on a concert
than to lose money and cancel a concert.

Students should not forget the SAB is supposed to
lose money. In fact, it is supposed to spend all the
money the E.C. allocates to it. The money is spent on
entertainment for the student body. Twenty-five per-
cent of the student body enjoyed Chapin. The only loss
resulting from the concert is that of the 75 percent
who chose not to attend.

* * Ss & *

While I’m feeling good and have nothing better to
write, I might as well praise the E.C. After all, they
are now the RtP’s publishers.

Seriously, the E.C. has done a commendable job
this year. The student body has been made to be
responsible. Student committees are now required to
keep acurate records. The individual members have
been unafraid to speak out for what they believe. The
honor code has been upheld in many cases.

Now, the E.C. has gone above and beyond the call of
duty. They will supply a keg of beer to students at the
next E.C. meeting. An E.C. meeting will be enjoyable
for once. This action is more responsible than having
a $240 party for themselves, as was the case last year.

*s & © © 8

Personal to the person who left part of himself in a
cup in the Cockpit Friday night: Sir, you are a cad,
disgusting, and a disgrace to the student body. You
are not a gentleman,sir.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

“Dig” writing critized

Editor:

The article appearing in last
week’s Ring-tum Phi on the
Liberty Hall excavations was a
great disappointment. One
would assume that if an article
cannot be factually accurate, it
could at least be well written.
Ned McDonnel’s article was
neither.

To cite just one of the article’s
numerous technical errors, test
pits are never ‘‘approximately
two to three feet in diameter,”’
but are exactly one meter
square. (Further, I’ve seen
many test pits dug, but I’ve
never seen one ‘“‘burrowed.’’)

McDonnel’s_ writing style
hurts his article even more. The
openning sentence is a fair
reflection of his story as a
whole: “On a bluff behind the
colonnade, behind the sports
stadium, and surrounded by
sweating, but constantly
dedicated workers, stands two
walls on either side of a high
reaching tree.”’ This mouthful
reads like a bad Victorian
diary. I would suggest to Mr.
McDonnel that these kind of ruf-

fles are better left to pulp
romantic novels than _ to

“serious journalism.”
The story’s greatest
weakness, however, is_ its

failure to even mention the ef-
forts of Hank McKelway.
McKelway is one of the most
central and important
members of the Liberty Hall
staff.

As site surveyor, McKelway
performs one of the most vital
and demanding functions on the
dig: mapping. The importance
of mapping to the entire opera-
tion is another area McDonnel
failed to mention.

While the members of the
Liberty Hall archeaological
project appreciate any publici-
ty, it is a shame that McDonnel
could not have done more
justice to a project that has
brought W&L so much prestige
and publicity.

About the only area McDon-
nel covered was a description of
Dr. McDaniel’s efforts. Those,
if anything, were understated.

Edward L. Bowie, ‘80

 

Famous?

 

Dear Mr. Gallagher:

My name is Randy Parks and
I am enrolled in a second-year
Latin course. For a project we
were to select several famous
personalities and inquire of
them their personal Latin ex-
perience.

Sir, at any time in your life
have you taken a Latin course?
If so, has it helped you to be suc-
cessful in your work? Thank
you very much for you time.

Sincerely yours
Randy Parks

DuPont - Gordon

Editor:

You're slipping a little, Mike.
All year long you've undertaken
the noble task of sacrificing
your campus image with the
status quo to expose the waste,
injustice, and abuse abundant
in many parts of the student
body. Anyone who is truly con-
cerned with student life here

(continued on page 7)

Student blasts Phi; defends Gordon

Editor:
After the post-election issue

of the Phi, I did not think the

editorial position of the paper
could slip any lower. This week
you said that the Publications
Board acted like a spoiled child
in suspending the Ring-tum Phi.
Yet wasn’t your own, self-
serving editorial about your
election defeat much worse?
The Phi is not your paper. It
belongs to the University, as the
flag used to proclaim and as you
are so fond of pointing out.

Thus I was surprised to find
that this week’s issue contained
even more non-news than usual,
details that seem to serve ho
other purpose than
demonstrating your own posi-
tion as editor. The first two
stories on the left side of the
front page were stale when they
were written. The student body,
which you claim to represent so
well, has grown sick of the
“Rank-tam Poon Controversy”

(largely manufactured, I think)

as they were of the content of
that humorless magazine. And
yet this week you also included
a copy of a WLUR editorial, as
well as an extra, boxed, diatribe
against the Pub. Board. Will
you please let the issue die?

But the most incredible part
of this week’sPhi is the editorial
attacking Dr. Al Gordon for
closing DuPont Auditorium to
future SAB use because of
repeated student misbehavior.
Mr. Gallagher, you claim that
we have a ‘right’ to use the
auditorium for other than
academic purposes. (A rather
shaky claim.) But you also imp-
ly that we have the perrogative
to treat it irresponsibly. This
deplorably selfish attitude is
again apparent when you sug-
gest that students calling
University officials should, if
they wish, remain anonymous.
Are the students too cowardly to
give their names? The “W&L
Gentleman” is a
theme of yours. Would you find

frequent.

this almost extinct individual
placing anonymous calls to the
home of Dean John, or Presi-
dent Huntley? I think not.

You have felt no reservation
about criticizing Dr. Gordon’s
action. But have you taken the
trouble to investigate the
precise nature of his respon-
sibilities to the University ad-
ministration in this instance?
And have you even bothered to
phone Dr. Gordon, as you sug-
gest we do?

One other thing bothered me
about your editorial. You rudely
relegate the filthy chore of
cleaning DuPont after movies
to the members of the Buildings
and Grounds department. You
imply that these dedicated men
are, in fact, menials whose only
job is to tidy up after selfish,
gross students. I think you
should apologize. What you
should have done was attack the
students for making the mess in
the first place. It seems rather

(continued on page 7)

 

 

~
 

 

    

and the wide disparity between
the professed and the practical
philosophies of W&L should
salute you and your efforts to
get the student body here to
wake up and, more important-
ly, grow up.

But perhaps the weight of
constant pressure to conform
has blinded you somewhat. The
editorial bit you wrote on the
‘‘Gordon-DuPont’’ decision
stinks. In it you reflect the im-
mature, irresponsible values
that so characterize the parts of
the student body you and I have
have both come to despise, that

group of overgrown youngsters .

who have falsely conceived this
school to be no more than a
finishing school for boys.

You correctly make the point
that DuPont is ‘‘ours.” But why
don’t we treat it like ours? You
engage in petty buck-passing by
shifting the burden to Buildings
and Grounds, our ‘‘maids’”’ and
“cleaning ladies,’’ no? What is
so difficult, so mind-boggling
about each student being
responsible for his own ac-
tions? Is it so terrible to simply
take with you what you’ve
brought? You may point out
the seeming triviality of this
argument, but I might add that
ignorance of this triviality has
cost all of us a very suitable
theater. We abused a privilege.
We didn’t deserve to keep it.

‘Moot Court

remarks

Editor:

In regard to the article
printed in the last issue of the
Phi covering the law school’s
Burks Moot Court competition,
I would like to emphazise that

the ‘‘quote”’ concerning my opi- |

nion of the Moot Court problem
was neither an accurate nor a
representative reflection of my
feelings regarding the competi-
tion. Frankly, I do not recall
having responded to an inter-
view question in the manner
quoted by the Phi: Unfortunate-
ly, the purported quote was a
gross misrepresentation of my
high regard for the competition.

The Burks Scholars and their
advisor Professor Anne Unver-
zagt deserve much gratitude
and commendation for_ their

genuine interest in the pro-

challenge which demanded

been afforded the opportunity to

A research paper written by a
Washington and Lee University
journalism professor, analyzing
the effectiveness with which
broadcasters in small radio-
Station markets determine
community needs and _ pro-
blems, has been chosen as one
of three winning research pro-
jects in a national competition.

The paper, ‘‘Community
Ascertainment - Practices’ of
Small-Market Broadcasters
under the FCC’s Second
Primer,” is by R. H. Mac-
Donald, professor of journalism
and head of the Department of
Journalism and Communica-
tions. The competition was

educational affiliate of the Na-
tional Association of Broad-

(FCC) requirements that they
maintain lists of local pro-
blems. Licensed broadcast sta-
tions are expected by the FCC
to help address those problems.
In larger markets, ‘‘ascertain-
ment surveys’ are required,
but small-market broadcasters
have been exempt from the
survey requirement since 1976.

MacDonald visited 11 radio
stations in 10 small Vermont
towns over a five-week period
last summer, interviewing sta-
tion managers and community
leaders. He found an acceptable
level of agreement on local pro-
blems, and then used U.S. Cen-
sus date to extrapolate his Ver-
mont data sample to a nation-
wide conclusion -- that small-
town station managers succeed
in discerning community pro-
blems with reasonable ac-
curacy, but that the cutoff
should probably not be raised
above the 1,000-population
level.

MacDonald, a native of Ver-
mont who had his first jobs in
broadcasting there, joined the
W&L journalism faculty in 1969
after 13 years with WDBJ-TV
News in Roanoke.

Med school acceptances

(continued from page 1)

(The biology department's
acceptance figure for 1976 is
70.4 percent of those students
and graduates who applied. )

Both Sacco and Dr. James H.
Starling, chairman of - the
biology department, place some
of the blame for the low accep-
tance rate on the new Medical
College Admissions Test
(MCAT).

The new comprehensive ex-
amination places more e hasis
on science rather than general
knowledge unlike the old test.

This year’s MCATs were also
a gruelling test of endurance,
lasting from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
with only an hour break for

_lunch, and one 10 minute break
in each testing session.

The Advisor, “the newsletter

for the National Association of
Advisors for the Health Profes-
sions,’ has come out strongly
against the new examinations,
urging that medical school ad-
missions officers take the dif-
ficulty of the new MCATs into
account with lower test scores.

“I feel I was definately
prepared,” said Sacco. ‘‘I have
just as good a background in
biological _ and’ chemical
sciences as students at any col-
lege throughout the nation.”’

Dr. Starling said that
Washington and Lee “has a
good reputation with medical
schools,”’ and pointed out that
the college national average for
acceptance to medical school is
“between 32 and 35 percent.”’

over three million copies), its
members’ aren’t’ exactly
newcomers to the music scene.
The group’s two main founders,
Mick Jones and lan Macdonald,
played with two extremely well-
known bands before forming
Foreigner--keyboardist
guitarist Macdonal: with King
Crimson, and guitarist Jones
with Gary Wright’s old band,
Spooky Tooth. They're joined on
record and onstage by Lou
Gramm on lead vocals, Al
Greenwood on keyboards, Ed
Gagliardi on bass and vocals,
and Dennis Elliot on drums.

Foreigner’s just-finished
world tour included stops in
California (California Jam II,
part of which may be seen this
Friday, May 19 at 11:30 on
ABC), Japan, Hong Kong,
Australia, Greece, Germany,
and England. The British visit
was capped by the band’s
premiere U.K. performance,
which took place at London's
Rainbow Theatre, and where
the capacity crowd cheered the
group on to three encores. The
entire tour was recorded on film
by noted cinematographer
Derek Burbridge, with distribu-
tion date to be announced.
Foreigner’s second album, Dou-
ble Vision, will be released by
Atlantic in June.

“Little Mary Sunshine”

(continued from page 3)

Will Cantler as ‘‘Cpl. ‘Billy’
Jester’” makes the audience
want to rush up and wipe off his
nose and clean hisglasses. Very
convincing. Penni Westbrook as
‘‘Mary”’ handles the songs well
with her nice voice. She is also
saccharin enough for the
melodramatic satire and keeps
the audience’ laughing
throughout the play. Sage
Parker is charming in her role
as “Nancy,” and a pleasure to
watch on stage. She is very
pretty.

The play drags in parts,
especially when Rose Gordon is
on stage or when the ‘‘Young
ladies of Eastchester Finishing
School”’ are trying to dogpaddle
through an especially thick and

‘“‘yucky’’ song. Gordon has a |

very annoying lisp which is ir-
ritable to the audience. She
makes .a. good effort with an
Austrian accent, but ruins the
effort by trying too hard to act.
She is not relaxed, and hence,

finally

Liebedich”’ is a pain rather than
a delight.

The ‘Forest Rangers’ are
charming and the audience
eagerly awaits their every ap-
pearance on stage. Every time
they enter, the refrain from
“The Forest Ranger’ is sung. It
is quite humorous.

The delight of the night is
‘‘Jim Weatherstone’’ as
General Oscar Fairfax, an ag-
ing old buck who still has his
eyes on the young girls. His per-
formance alone makes the play
a worthwhile and enjoyable ex-
perience. Weatherstone is com-
pletely at ease with his
character and his voice is love-
ly. The audience is his before
the end of the play.

Though there are moments
when you feel you should get up
and leave, bits of humor
restrain you. As a whole, Little
Mary Sunshine, with its slightly
overused plot, has some in-
teresting underlying humor. If
you can stand molasses, the
final taste is sweet.

Ervin

(continued from page 1!)

I want to be fit for myself to
know

I want to be able as days go by

To look myself straight in the
eye

I don’t want to stand with the
setting sun “

And hate myself for the things
I’ve done.”’

Ervin also spoke of the im-
portance of the first ammend-
ment. He said that it was put in
because the founders ‘‘as
philosophers saw it as essential
to have a free flow of informa-
tion to avoid tyranny over the
mind.”’ “eS

He also joked about the Lance
case by stating that “‘if I had
money, I wouldn’t put it into a
bank run by Bert Lance.”’

And Ervin condemned the
president’s stand on human
rights. He said that it is not
public police to tell other coun-
tries how to live their lives. “I
deplore the conditions in Africa
and Russia, but it isn’t our
business to tell them how to
live,” hesaid. ~ :
