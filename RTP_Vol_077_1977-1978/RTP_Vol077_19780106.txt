Student opinion ignored

SAB votes in closed

session to get Four Tops

by Randy Smith
The Student Activities Board
has voted overwhelmingly to
contact the Four Tops to per-
form during Fancy Dress
Weekend, theRing-tum Phi has

learned from a_ confidential

source on the SAB.

The vote to try to sign the
Four Tops to play Thursday
night, February 23, took place
after the last SAB meeting
before Christmas break. In a
closed session, SAB members
voted 10-1 in favor of contacting
the group for a reported $2,300,
the source disclosed. The Four
Tops is now a disco band.

Charlie Hulfish, co-chairman
of the SAB, confirmed the
report about efforts to hire the
Four Tops, but said he was not
sure about the price and would
‘“thave to check the minutes of
the meeting.” Jim Foreman,
treasurer of the SAB, also did
not remember the cost of the
disco band, but said the $2,300
figure sounded ‘“‘very close.”’

The Ring-tum Phi’s SAB
source said that the price of the
Four Tops was ‘‘supposed to be
a bargain.”’ The band reported-
ly is playing in Charlottesville
during the weekend of Fancy
Dress, thus lowering their price
tag for a Thursday night per-
formance in near-by Lexington.
Hulfish said that he thought the
Four Tops were commanding
$3,000 at the - University of
Virginia on Friday night.

Not included in the SAB’s
$2,300 cash outlay is the cost of a
back-up band for the Four Tops,
still unchosen. Foreman said
he did not know the total
budget for Thursday night, or
even the projected cost of the
entire weekend. He would not
know the expenses for the
weekend until the bills came in,
Foreman said.

According to the SAB source,
the anticipated performance by
the Four Tops is “primarily
responsible” for the three
dollar increase in the entrance
fee to Fancy Dress Weekend’s
activities. This year’s tickets
will cost $15 per couple.

‘Non-SAB members attending
the open meeting were asked to
leave before the vote. The
possibility of the Four Tops
playing Fancy Dress Weekend
was not brought up during the
meeting. Co-chairman Bill
Tucker hinted that he had “‘a
lead on a good band,’ but
declined to name the group in
an open session.

Hulfish said the meeting was
called into closed session

because ‘“‘if we had had an open
meeting, then people who we
don’t have much control over
would spread false rumors.”

“We are a business. We han-
dle a lot of money. We don’t
have time to solicit students
about entertainment. A decision
had to be reached,’’ Hulfish ex-
plained.

When asked why a band not
discussed in an open session
was voted on in a closed one,
Hulfish said he “didn’t see a
need for an open session... There
are times when we can’t have
students sliding into our office.”

He added that he felt the Stu-
dent Activities Board ‘‘is a good
cross representation’ of the
students, and that the SAB is
not ‘‘anti-student.”’

Saturday
classes

explained

by Jim Ingham

According to a plan approved
by the faculty in November of
1976, classes are scheduled on
Saturday this week. William
Watt, Dean of the College, said
that having Saturday classes is
necessary because New Year’s
Day fell on a Monday. He said
that this seemed to be the most
reasonable course to take.

Dean Watt said that the
reason the missed classes had
to be made up was because it
was necessary to keep the
number of classes for each
course the same. He said that
there are some classes which
meet only on Monday and that
not having classes would put
them way behind. He also said
that each day of the week had a
different schedule from any
other, and that missing one day
would cause a lot of problems.

Other plans were also
discussed, stated Watt, but
were rejected for one reason or
another. He said that starting
classes on Monday, thus remov-
ing the need for Saturday
classes, would have meant that
students would have to travel on
New Year’s Day. Another op-
tion, he said, was to have put off
the start of the winter term for a
whole week, but this would have
meant an additional week later

on.

NUMBER 13

 

Ashe and Colby to appear

by Jim Barnes

Tennis great Arthur Ashe and
superspook William Colby will
speak at W&L as part of Con-
tact’s 1977-78 program before
the February break. Ashe is
scheduled to speak on January
18, while Colby will follow on
February 2.

Ashe, a graduate of UCLA,
has won three of the grand slam
singles championships. He cap-
tured the Austrailian Open in
1970, Wimbledon in 1975, and the
U. S. Open in 1968. He also won
the World Championship of Ten-
nis singles title in 1975, and the
French Open men’s doubles
crown in 1971 with Marty
Riessen.

Perhaps Ashe’s most per-
sonally- treasured victories
have come when he has played
for the United States in Davis
Cup competition. Ashe’s strong

_ feelings on the responsibility of

U. S. pros to play for the Davis
Cup team earned him a
threatened three million dollar
law suit compiliments of Jim-

Copy Center
motive

by Ken Mastrilli

School officials and pro-
fessors are still puzzled as to the
motive for two break-ins at the
University Print Shop shortly
before the beginning of the fall
term final exam period.

There are still no suspects in
the incidents which are being
investigated by campus securi-
ty officials Bob Murray, and the
ever-present ‘“Murph.’’ There
were two break-ins: one on the
evening of Tuesday, December
6, and the other the following
night in which someone broke
into a cabinet. containing
printed copies of 27
undergraduate and law final ex-
ams.

‘Almost every professor who
had an exam in the cabinet had
a new one madeup and
reprinted,’’ said Fontanne
Bostic, who is the copy center
supervisor. Bostic said she had
asked the Buildings and
Grounds department to install a
lock on the copy center leading
to the room where the cabinet

my Conners in 1975.

Ashe, not only an excellent
player, is highly respected by
his colleagues as a spokesman
for improvement and innova-
tion in professional tennis. He is
the winner of the William M.
Johnston and Harold A. Lebair
Memorial Trophies for sport-
smanship.

Ashe also is an articulate and
longstanding opponent of the
apartheid policies of the
government of South Africa.

Few men are better ac-
quainted with the work of spies
than William Colby, the ex-
director of the Central In-
telligence Agency. He is a
graduate of Princeton Universi-
ty who served in the Office of
Strategic Services during World
War II. In 1943 he parachuted
into France to aid a Resistance
unit. Later in the war he lead a
commando group into Norway
to sabotage a railway line.

After the war he returned to
the United States, earned a law
degree from Columbia, and

break-in
questioned

was located but they were ap-
parently too busy to do the work
that Wednesday, she said. Dean
of Students Lewis John did have
B&G install locks on all doors
leading to the copy center the
day after the break-ins oc-
curred.

There is speculation on the
part of various school officials
that the person who broke in
was looking for the small
amount of money which was
sometimes kept in the cabinet.
Director of News Services Bob
Keefe suggested that it may
have been somebody’s idea of a
joke because it appeared that
nothing had been disturbed on
the night of the first break-in.

School Proctor ‘‘Murph”’
said, ‘‘Whoever broke in knew
what he was looking for and it
wasn't money.” Murph said he
and his assistants were ‘‘look-
ing at a few things,”’ but declin-
ed to comment in case their
suspicions were unfounded.

Hunter McCoy and Wayne

practiced law in New York.
When the Korean War broke out
he joined the OSS’ successor,
the CIA. He _ served in
Stockhome and Rome in the
1950s and was named station
chief for Saigon in 1959. Three
years later he became the chief
of the CIA’s Far Eastern divi-
sion in Washington. He returned
to Saigon in 1968 to preside over
the U. S. pacification effort
which included the notorious
Phoenix program. Over 20,000
Viet Cong and their sym-
pathizers were killed as a result
of this program which has been
criticised for its excesses
leading to the deaths of several
thousand innocent non-
combatants.

In 1971 Colby returned to the
CIA’s headquarters in Langley,
Virginia to assume command of
the agency’s supersecret Direc-
torate of Operations. He was
named Director of the CIA in
1973. In 1975, when President
Ford was reorganizing his Na-
tional Security Council, Colby
was relieved of his duties.

 

Notice

Due to complaints from
the student body about
crowded conditions at
last year’s Fancy Dress
Ball, the Student Ac-
tivities Board has decid-
ed to limit the sale of
tickets. They will be sold
ONLY to members of the
immediate Washington
and Lee community. This
includes students (law
and undergraduate) and
their dates, faculty, anda
limited number of alum-
ni. No guests from other
schools will be admitted.

Other details about this
year’s Fancy Dress—the
schedule of events, ticket
sale procedure...and the
announcement of the
theme for Friday night’s
Ball — will appear in
next week’s Ring-tum
Phi. Watch for it...

RtP Commentary

 

E.C. performance reviewed

by Lee Howard

Since the Executive Commit-
tee is not on ‘Washington and
Lee time”’ it did not meet Tues-
day (Monday?), which gives
the Ring-tum Phi an opportuni-
ty to assess the performance of
both the EC in general and EC
members in particular so far
this year.

First, it’s necessary to point
out that the EC has accomplish-
ed some very substantial
changes. Accounting guidelines
have been set up and ad hoc
members to committees have
been instructed to go over ex-
penditures with committee co-
chairmen at least once per
term. Parties and dinners for

- committee members partially
funded by EC money must be
made public and approved now
for the first time. Contact had
$590 taken away from it. Honor
defendants were given the right
to see a copy of all physical
evidence against them before a
trial is held. And the Music
Union was established.

These are not insubstantial
changes. They reflect an open-
ness to far-reaching, wor-
thwhile proposals which is
refreshing. However, the EC’s
unwillingness to make their
party decision binding on future
ECs will mean that less respon-
sible committees in the future
will backslide into the old
system of covering up parties.

Despite all the forementioned
changes made by this year’s
EC, it is hardly the crusading
group which it sometimes has
appeared to be. Much like last
year’s EC it waits for issues to
come to it. Unlike past years,
however, this year’s EC has
met issues head on rather than
delaying decisions for ‘‘further
study.” This is probably a
reflection of EC President Jim
Underhill’s no-nonsense ap-
proach to EC meetings. He
doesn’t like to let discussion
drag on when he believes a con-
sensus has already been reach-
ed. As a result , of course, it is
possible that he makes up some
members’ minds for them when
he says “I guess we all agree
that...’’ He certainly seems to
hold the balance of the commit-
tee firmly in his hand.

The following is the Ring-tum
Phi’s assessment of the other 11
committee members.

—George Griffin, vice presi-
dent. Although perhaps not as
much of a driving force on this
year’s EC as Sandy Stradtman
was on last year’s, this is more
of a reflection on the increased
leadership of Underhill as op-
posed to Bob Hunter than it is a
reflection of Griffin’s reduced
leadership capacity. Indeed,
when Griffin disagrees with
Underhill (which is surprisingly
often) his ideas are given as

much or more weight than the -

president’s. This was best
demonstrated when Griffin
almost single-handedly swayed
four votes to his side on the par-
ties issue.

—Neil Pentifallo, secretary.
Pentifallo has been absent
much of the year due to an
operation which kept him in the
hospital. It is therefore difficult

to assess his performance. He
has maintained his record as
the closest examiner of
representatives of organiza-
tions who want money, but his
leadership ability has yet to be
proven. Perhaps with improved
health he will take his place as a
leader of the EC.

—Mike Missal, senior. Missal
has projected himself as being a
maverick. An ardent defender
of Ariel one week, another week
he was adamantly opposed to
salaries for editors of publica-
tions. One week he voted to
depose Charlie Hulfish as SAB
co-chairman and another week
he didn’t want the EC to oversee
parties because he thought the
EC was becoming ‘‘too
overbearing on committees.”’
This has caused some persons
to accuse Missal of being a
‘“‘srandstander.’’: In any case
Missal is one of the most con-
cerned EC members:

—Doug Perkins,’ ‘senior.
Perkins seems? ‘interested in
what’s being discussed and on
occasion injects ‘an‘ intelligent
comment, but his:participation,
for a senior, has been disappoin-
ting. Perhaps Perkins needed a
breaking-in period and will now
live up to his capabilities. He
has usually voted to retain the
status quo.

—Jack Bovay, junior. Bovay
has demonstrated enough
leadership ability to make him
a strong candidate for EC presi-
dent next year. Bovay is very
intense. His arguments are
often impassioned. If Griffin is
the reasoner and Underhill the
strong arm of the EC, Bovay is
the heart. Despite a basically
conservative make-up, Bovay
voted to have parties okayed by
the EC and to depose Hulfish.

—Jim Davis, junior. Davis
very rarely says anything. This
makes it very difficult to say
that he’s added anything to the
EC. He did contribute quite a bit
to the Contact controversy. He
was a staunch defender of Con-
tact and of his friends Walter
Granruth and Billy Webster.
Davis was EC ad hoc member
to Contact, but knew nothing of

Contact’s actions until the Ring-
tum Phi disclosed them.

—Steve Abraham,
sophomore. Abraham, much
like Perkins, seems interested
but doesn’t say that much.
When he does make a comment,
however, it is usually very
perceptive. Give Abraham
time. He’s just a sophomore.

—Andy Bodenstab,
sophomore. There is very little
you can say about a person who
has said, perhaps, two words all
year. Except he is not doing his
job.

—Chris Gammon, freshman.
Gammon doesn’t say all that
much but he seems to be very
sharp and the questions he asks
and comments he makes in-
dicate he is learning very rapid-
ly.

—Jackie Boyden, law school.
Boyden rode on the coattails of
Rick Goddard for a while, but
seems to have struck out on her
own since then. Very self-
assured, she has a liberal voting
record:

—Rick Goddard, law school.
Enough said. He’s gone.

ROTC commitment
clarified

by Galen Trussell

ROTC enrollment does not
lead automatically to a three
year commitment, according to
Captain Long of the Washington
and Lee ROTC department.

Long said that many
freshmen and sophomores har-
bor the misunderstanding that
ROTC enrollment implies a
commitment of three years’ ac-
tive service. This is no longer
true since the Army now has a
surplus of officers. Instead of
the three year commitment, the
Army has an Active Duty for
Training (ADT) program which
commits ROTC cadets to only
three months of active duty
after graduation.

An ROTC cadet may be
guaranteed that he will receive
ADT. The ADT option is part of
the enlistment contract signed
by cadets at the start of their
junior year. Those cadets in-
terested in attending graduate
school who request ADT can
receive a three year deferment
before serving their three mon-
ths.

When an ROTC cadet chooses
ADT he commits himself to
three months of training after

Cockpit hosts Gong Show

each other, as well as other stu-
dent organizations, such as Con-
tact, EC, SAB, Calyx and all
others. All college students
would be eligible for the gala
event, and that includes any in-
terested females from
neighboring schools, and all law
students as well.

Tucker’s present plans in-
clude having three faculty
volunteers as judges. He says
that prizes will be awarded to
those students doing the best
job of ‘‘entertaining,”’

Tucker believes the
more students that participate,
more fun will occur. And after
the cold weather, rain and ex-
ams, what better way to start
off a new term? If you are in-
terested, either see him or drop
your name off at the secretary’s
desk in the Student Center.

A good movie hits Lexington—

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

There are many perils to liv-
ing in our small metropolis, but
to any moviegoer there is one
disadvantage of supreme an-
noyance. This is the Christmas
film squeeze.

We’ve all been through it —
you wait for a new hit film to ar-
rive in Lexington all through
the fall term. It opened in your
city soon after you got here in
September. December arrives,
you're still waiting, you’ve
finished your last exam...and
then you walk past the State or
Lyric. And what do you see?
Yes! The local movie ownership
has finally decided to stop its 3-
month run of Walt Disney and
cheap porn flicks! The movie
you awaited so anxiously is
coming to town!!!...two days
after you leave for home. And at
home, the movie has come and
gone. Too bad.

So just imagine our surprise
when, upon returning to Lex-
ington, we found “Oh, God!”

still playing at the State...one of
the most talked about movies of
recent months.

And understandably so. Carl
Reiner has worked one of the
greatest miracles in this year’s
cinema corpus. He’s made God

a laughing matter.
The story revolves around
“the big G’ — as he calls

himself — who figures it’s about
time to pay this world another
visit and spread the word. Play-
ing God is no less than George
Burns. With Crosby and Benny
dead, and Hope still a little too
bawdy to be even saintlike,
much less take the driver’s
seat, Burns was almost certain-
ly the natural choice. And he br-
ings to the. sereen one of the
most endearing comic portraits
in years. From the sneakers on
his feet to the fishing cap on his
head, he is pure magic.

The variety of techniques he
employs to inspire belief in the
heart of a” grocery manager
(played by co-star John
Denver) is winning. But the

Bradley selected by.
Rhodes committee

Mark A. Bradley, a W&L
senior American history major,
was one of 32 college men and
women in America named
Rhodes Scholars last weekend.
The Rhodes is considered one of
the most important academic
honors an American student
can receive.

Bradley becomes Washington
and Lee’s third Rhodes Scholar
in the past seven years, and
W&L’s 1ith since the program
was established in 1902 by the
British philanthropist Cecil
Rhodes.

Bradley will spend two years
at Oxford in England
“reading,” or studying, modern
history. He said he hopes to pur-
sue a career in the Foreign Ser-
vice.

He is a Phi Beta Kappa stu-
dent at W&L whose cumulative
grade-point average is 3.8 on a
4.0 scale. He has won a number
of grants and scholarships, in-
cluding a Robert E. Lee Honor
Scholarship, W&L’s Elizabeth
B. Garrett Scholarship in
history, a George C. Marshall
Research Foundation Scholar-
ship, a Virginia Merit Scholar-
ship, and two academic awards
in the German department at
W&L, the Jim Stump and
James S. Woods prizes. He has
also held two Robert E. Lee
Research Grants in history.

Bradley was Virginia
amateur boxing champion in
the 140-150-pound weight class
from 1972 to 1976. In addition to
his studies, he has worked part-
time throughout college.

He is the son of State Police
Sgt. and Mrs. Charles S.
Bradley of Roanoke. His grand-
mother, Mrs. George Butler,

lives on a beef cattle farm in
Steeles Tavern, north of Lex-
ington, and Bradley lives there
and helps with framwork dur-
ing the school year.

Rhodes Scholars are chosen
on a regional basis in the United
States. Bradley was one of four
selected from a six-state region
which includes Virginia. Selec-
tions are based on intellectual
achievement, character,
leadership, and physical vigor.

Nationally, 32 Rhodes
Scholars are selected each
year. Twelve 1977 recipients
were women. This was the se-
cond year women were eligible
to compete.

climactic courtroom scene is
the key. Hopefully it will secure
an Oscar nomination for Burns.
At least, it has brought him
back on his high plane after his
pitifully wooden last venture in
“The Sunshine Boys.”’ In short,
Burns makes God the kind of
guy you’d kinda enjoy having
around. And that’s really what
it’s all supposed to be about in
the long run, right?

The supporting characters
are all warm, funny, believably
confused. The pace is brisk and
never wavers from the main
story line. And along the way,
we are presented with an array

McHenry’ssuccessor

debated by UCA

by Jim Barnes

The state of the coaching
shake-up in the football pro-
gram is so sensitive that Presi-
dent Huntley initially only con-
sulted the faculty members of
the University Committee on
Athletigs on the future leader-
ship of the football team.
Huntley said that he separated
faculty members Drs. Kozak,
Elms, Ray, Devogt, and
Steinhiemer (who was not in at-
tendance) from law student
Derek Swope, and undergrad
seniors Mark Bennett and Mark
Derbyshire, because he did not
want the students presence to
intimidate any free exchange
between the faculty and the
President concerning the “‘foot-
ball program.”

Huntley met with the faculty
members of the Athletic Com-
mittee on Friday, December 2,
at 12:30 in the afternoon, the
regular time the whole commit-
tee meets. Initially the student
members felt their opinion was
being avoided, but had their
suspicions removed when
Huntley, early in the following
week, personally briefed them
on the deliberations to date.

The students anticipate that

they will have significant input
into the final decision on the
football team’s new leadership.
As Swope says, ‘‘He (Huntley)
assured us that we’d be in on the
decision every step of the way.”’

There is some _ question,

_ however, whether the coaching

change will be limited to Bill
McHenry’s old top spot. After
meeting with Huntley Bennett
was asked if the discussions
about next year’s coaching staff
were limited to head coach.
Bennett replied, “That question
will lead us to matters. that we
are not ready at this time to
discuss.”

Swope believes that the duties
of Athletic Director’ were very
trying for McHenry. Swope
said, ‘‘He looks like he’s really
worried about a lot of different
things.”’

Huntley remained noncom-
mitted on the question of where
the next head coach will come
from. He said, ‘Whether we'll
seek a new coach from the out-
side or not has not been decided
yet.’ Huntley also said that the
matter requires a fairly prompt
decision, but it will not be made
until after the Christmas break.

Four swimmers

are NCAA best

Four of W&L’s swimming
Generals have achieved na-
tional ranking in their respec-
tive events. This information
was released by the NCAA in
their first Division III ‘“Top
Ten” listing of the 1977-78
season.

Senior John Hudson, a thir-
teen time All-American in the
past three seasons, is ranked
number one in the 1,000 yard
freestyle with a time of 9:46.99.
The closest challenge to Hud-
son’s time is thirteen seconds
back at 9:59.5. Hudson is also
ranked number two in the 500
free with a 4:48.3. The leader in
the 500 has a time of 4:45.96 and
was last year’s national cham-
pion.

Senior co-captain Peter
Meem is ranked number two
this season in the 200 yard
breastroke, while junior co-
captain Kieth Romich is the na-
tion’s third ranked swimmer in
the 100 freestyle. Junior Chip
Hoke is ranked fourth in the 500
free.

In addition to these four in-
dividuals, both of the Generals’
relay teams are also ranked in
the nation’s top five Division III
times. The 400 free relay of Bob

Newcomb, Scott Duff, Romich
and Hudson is ranked third,
while the 400 medley relay team
of Drew Pillsbury, Will Hodges,
Duff and Newcomb is ranked
fifth.

Last year, W&L finished the
year as the nation’s ninth rank-
ed Division III team and had
five All-Americans on their
roster.

Coach Bill Sterns’ swimmers
face the Gobblers of Virginia
Tech in Blacksburg this Satur-
day. Tech is one of eight Divi-
sion I teams on the 1977-78 W&L
swimming schedule. Last year
Tech blew the Generals out of
the water, but Stearns thinks
this team can reverse last
year’s verdict.

Their first home meet of the
season will be Saturday,
January 14th against George
Washington University in the
Cy Twombly Pool. W&L is cur-
rently . 2-1 overall defeating
James Madison 58-55 and VMI
68-45 and losing to the Universi-
ty of Richmond 69-44. The team
spent the week prior to
Christmas training at the Swim-
ming Hall of Fame in Ft.

SUPER BOWL XII

 

Can the “Orange Crush” put the squeeze
on 'T.D." and ‘Roger the Dodger.’’ We'll
find out Jon. 15.

Denver by 3

After six pre-season, 14
regular season and two playoff
games, the emotionally charg-
ed “Orange Crush’ from the
snowy mile-high city of Denver
will take on the _ highly
mechanized and _ disciplined
Cowboys from the “good ole
boys’ state of Texas.

Both teams have run, passed,
blocked and tackled their ways
to the top of their respective
conferences, although Denver
has been more consistent
throughout the year. Sure
Dallas was 12-2 in regular
season play as was Denver.

But Landry’s leviathans were
a hot and cold team, a fact
evidenced by their two playoff
victories this year. They
decimated the Chicago Bears
but then appeared flat against
the ill-fated Minnesota Vikings.

To get to the Super Bowl
Denver had to beat two of the
roughest teams in the NFL,
Oakland and Pittsburgh. They
did it on the strength of their
defense, which is the main
reason they will beat the
Cowboys. Sure the Cowboys
beat them in that meaningless
last game of the regular season
when the Broncos played their
backup QB Norris Weese most
of the game. Weese’s only ap-
pearance in Super Bowl XII will
probably come when he holds
for Jim Turner’s extra point at-
tempts. This is barring any in-
jury to veteran signal-caller
Craig Morton.

Denver will be able to shut off
the Dallas running attack of
Tony Dorsett and Bob
Newhouse mainly through the
efforts of All-Pros Lyle Alzado
and Tom Jackson.

Jackson may be the best
linebacker in pro football today.
Look for him to be around the
ball on every play and perhaps
intercept a Roger Staubach
aerial or two. Alzado is a
leader. He gets everyone psych-
ed up. Sometimes a little too
much, as he has a tendency to

Dallas rolls

This may be The Year of The
Horse, but it is not the year of

the Denver Broncos. The Dallas |
Cowboys will regain some of the }
NFC’s lost pride at the season }

finale in the Superdome.
While the Broncos have

amassed an impressive 12-2 |

regular season record (one of
those losses being
Cowboys at the regular season’s
conclusion) they have been less
than commanding in the
playoffs. Dallas on the other

hand shows no sign of stagger- |

ing in their holy quest.

The game will be a classic |

match of defenses, pitting the

innovative 3-4 of Denver against |

the more traditional 4-3 lineup
of Dallas. But the Cowboy of-
fense will make orange mar-
malade out of the ‘Orange
Crush.”’ Roger Staubach, Tony
Dorsett, Preston and Drew
Pearson, Robert Newhouse,

Golden Richards, and Billy Joe |

DuPree, in the hands head

coach Tom Landry, the game’s |

offensive genius, will baffle
Bronco chief Red Miller, and
wear down his highly touted
defense on the field.

Craig Morton is the key to

Denver’s offense. His injured }
hip will only accentuate his’

characteristic immobility set-
ting up to pass. Harvy Martin
and Ed “Too-Tall” Jones will
play rodeo putting their own
special brand on Morton’s hip,
and if Morton goes, so goes the
Bronco’s chances. The rest of
the Dallas ‘‘flex” should be able
to corral Denver’s patchwork
offense.

It’s also safe to say that Lan-
dry possesses some special in-

sights on Morton that Miller

does not have on Staubach.

The Cowboys have the playoff
experience behind them and
enough poise to tame the Bron-
cos away from their partisan
crowds at Mile High Stadium. If
you want to make the game “‘a
little more interesting,”
this game might need it, take
the Cowboys and give up to9'2.

to the }

and}

 

Lee ranked eighth in the state of
Virginia by the Roanoke Times.
Washington and Lee is present-
ly ranked above Old Dominion
University, Richmond and
Randolph-Macon.

The Generals shot excep-
tionally well in their victory
over Eastern Connecticut. They
hit 20 of 22 shots from the foul
line. From the field, they were
led by super shooter Pat Den-
nis. Dennis not only had 35
points, but shot an amazing 77
per cent from the field, hitting
on 17 of 22 shots. The Generals
also got some scoring from
their front line as power for-
ward Larry Meyer had twenty
points and small forward Dave
Leunig had eleven points.

The Generals’ torrid shooting
did not continue the next night
so they had a difficult time with
a 24 Staten Island team. The
Generals trailed by one at half,
but pulled away late in the
game. Leading the way again
was senior guard Dennis who
had 33 points. Again Meyer and
Leunig scored in double figures
with 14 and 12 points respective-
ly. Freshman center Bob
Smitherman, filling in for the
injured Ardith Collins had nine
rebounds.

The Generals will host their
tenth annual Washington and
Lee Invitational Tournament
this Friday and Saturday even-
ings at Doremus Gymnasium.
The Generals have won seven of

the nine previous invitational

titles and figure to make it eight
out of ten. They take on Case
Western of Cleveland, Ohio
(4-17 last year) Friday at 9 p.m.
Then in the finals at 9 p.m. on
Saturday they will meet the
winner of Swarthmore (7-13 last
year) and Salisbury State (16-15
last year).

This tournament may answer
two big questions. First, can the
Generals play two good games
within a_ twenty-four hour
period? So far this year they
have not. In the first game of
the season they blasted the in-
ept Clinch Valley College off the

_ floor. However, the next night,

they lost to patsy York in a ma-
jor upset. On the road trip, they
beat a respected team fairly
easily, but the next night they
had to fight for their lives and
were outrebounded by a 2-6
team. Physical and/or emo-
tional fatigue have been cited as
reasons for this inconsistency.
It may be too demanding to play
with the intensity that Coach
Canfield requires for two con-
secutive nights. Nobody knows
the answer for sure, but if the
Generals. lose Saturday
everybody will be asking the
question.

Secondly, the offense scored a
lot fewer points on the trip up
north. Whether this reflects a
more disciplined style of play, a
different type of competition, or
just a fluke, is hard to say at
this point. However, it is in-
teresting to note that
Washington and Lee point
guards were averaging around
twenty points a game before the
road trip, but averaged fewer
than five points a game during
the winter break.

rough the passer. Dallas has a slight edge with

Denver has been coming up
with the big play all year.
Jackson’s two interceptions in
the last five minutes of the
playoff game against the
Steelers is a perfect example.
Denver’s offense converted
both interceptions into scores to
put away the Steelers who were
in the game until then.

Denver doesn’t have a high-
powered offense with intricate
formations like Dallas. The
Broncos rely on the strength of
their outstanding offensive line
to give protection to Craig Mor-
ton and open holes fer Rob Ly-
tle, the former Michigan stan-
dout, and John Keyworth. Also,
don’t be surprised if you see
Otis Armstrong come off the
bench and pick up a crucial first
down for the Broncos, much as
he did in the closing minutes
against Oakland when the Bron-
cos needed.a first down to keep
possession and run out the
clock.

The two teams run and pass
equally well. But Morton should
be able to throw against a
Dallas secondary which is
suspect. Morton is a good
passer, especailly when he’s
throwing in the direction of
Haven Moses who caught six
passes for 168 yards against
Oakland. Both Charlie Waters
and Cliff Harris can be beaten.
The Steelers’ Lynn Swann prov-
ed that two years ago in Super
Bowl X as he and Terry Brad-
shaw burned them for 180

Staubach. He can run whereas
Morton is not nearly as mobile
in the pocket. Staubach is a
streak passer while Morton is
fairly consistent. Ironically,
Morton was traded from Dallas
so that Staubach could start all
the time, thus ending the annual
battle there for the quarter-
backing job.

Stopping the Staubach to
Pearson connection will be dif-
ficult but if anyone can do it the
Broncos can. Their secondary
plays both the pass and the run

very tough.

But can Dallas defeat ‘‘fate,”
a formidable adversary which
appears to be on Denver’s side
this year. This will be Dallas’
fourth appearance. They’ve lost
two and they’re 1-2, and would
like to even the score as well as
pick up the $25,000 for each win-
ning player. But ‘“‘fate,” that
most powerful of intangibles,
appears to be on Denver’s side.

Jimmy the Greek always has
a category he calls the “in-
tangibles,”’ which I guess in-
cludes team spirit, motivation
and “the big break,” then it
must be Denver. Denver 20—
Dallas 17 in a classic confronta-
tion.

than originally thought. As a
result, the Generals will pro-
bably have to battle Campbell
College and Duke University
without the promising
freshman on January 13th and
14th.

Despite the loss of Kramer,
the Generals are still confident
that they will have a successful
season. This year’s schedule,
which features Division I
schools Harvard, Duke, and
VMI, is the longest and most
challenging the team has faced
in years, with only three mat-
ches scheduled in Lexington.
According to the Generals the
severity of the schedule won’t
hinder the teams performance.
“If you enjoy wrestling you
don’t even think about the
schedule,’ said sophomore

Mike Deighan. Junior Captain
Ed Rodgers, never one to be
found without something to say,
also commented on this year’s
schedule. ‘Sure it’s rough,”
said the talented 150 pounder,
“but to have a first rate wrestl-
ing program you need challeng-
ing matches. Any team can beat
up on a bunch of nobodies, but it
doesn’t prove a thing. And,
when you look at last year’s
record (10-3 with a victory over
VMI), I think you’ll find we’re
definitely capable of mixing it

up with the big boys.”
Following their matches with
Campbell and Duke, the

Generals remain on the road
throughout January, not return-
ing home until February 7th
when they battle ODAC rival
Hampden-Sydney.

When dividend rates go up, life insurance costs go

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Grinch who
stole Saturday

Every mink down in Mink-ville liked Saturday a lot,

But the Grinch who lived in the middle of Mink-ville did not!
The Grinch hated Saturday, and for a very poor reason,

It didn’t quite fit into the school day season.

The Grinch, from his perch high in Washington Hall,

Where everday life seems so trivial and small,

Said to himself, on some dark gloomy day,

‘‘T’ve got to find a plan to take Saturday away.

If I take Saturday away, then to school they must come,

Ha! toschool they must come, amidst their hangovers from rum,
They must leave their warm beds and with sad hearts,

Say goodbye to their sweet, little Friday night tarts.

They must rise bright and early on this January 7 date,

And come to school in a hurry and stay late, late, late!

Now the mean old Grinch was as delighted as could be,
and he told himself so, as he slapped his own knee,
‘‘Oh, how happy I am to take Saturday away,

Oh, how happy I am that the minks must pay,

For getting an extra day with their ‘rents,

For whom I really wouldn’t give a petty two cents.
Even though Monday was the day after New Year’s,

I am sure they only wanted it to sip a few more beers.

Then the Grinch sat down, and with a couple of wheezes, ) «
With a couple of belches and a couple of sneezes, ;

He took out the calendar, a pair of scissors and turned, -

To the week of the first, and then his heart yearned,

To cut out Saturday, and cut, cut he did.

He cut and he snipped and he snipped and he cut and before long,
Why even before the Lee Chapel clock struck an early morning
dong,

Before the sun rose high in the dawn,

Saturday, sweet Saturday, was gone.

Way down in Mink-ville lives a special breed of evil;
Saturday-stealing grinches who eat little finches.

But also in Mink-ville live the minks who are good,

They go to school during the week, like all students should.

On Sunday, it’s Sunday-school. On Monday, it’s Monday-school.
On Tuesday it’s Tuesday-school and on Wednesday it’s Wednesday-
school. On Thursday it’s J-school and even on Friday, it’s C-school.
But Saturdays, sweet Saturdays are to each and every mink,
No-school days, and so they rightly think!

To the minks, school on Saturday is not so very funny,

They'd miss sleeping, and minking, and even Bugs Bunny.

Now the minks took this seriously, as serious as could be,

And they looked everywhere for answers, they looked under trees,
They looked under stumps, they looked under bumps,

They looked under rocks, they looked behind clocks,

They looked everywhere where lookers would look,

And the answer was found ina history book!

The period of the sixties was where the answer was found,

When the children were vocal and sat on the ground.

But minks are never vocal, people would misconstrue,

Minks only thirst, and do what minks do.

Amidst the confusion, a speaker arose,

and opened his mouth and said on his toes,

‘If the Grinch wants Saturday school, he can go, and take a leap,
We'll do as minks do, and stay home and sleep.”

Letters to Editor

Concern urged

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

Following the _ constant
pleading of concerned
Americans, as well as recent
resolutions passed by the Ap-
palachian Trail conference and
the Appalachian National
Scenic Trail Advisory Council
urging ‘immediate congres-
sional action, bills providing for
the future protection of the A.T.
have at last reached congress.

At present, over 40 per cent of
the A.T. lies on private land and
its existance is therefore sub-
ject to the descretion of the
owners. In addition, 175 miles of
the trail are already on roads
and much of the scenic beauty
has succumed to the get-rich-
quick schemes of land
speculators and_ private
developers.

Thus, House Bill 8803 and
Senate bill 2006 have been in-
troduced to insure the halt of
any further damage to the trail
by providing for the following:

1) authorization of monies to
protect the trail

2) creation of a wider Ap-
palachian Trail corrider

3) insured continuation of the
A.T. Advisory Council as well
as provisions for the Ap-
palachian Trail Conference to
have a vote on the council

In order to insure the passage
of these bills, it is imperative
that concerned citizens act now
by writing their senators and
congressmen, urging them to
support Senate bill 2066 and
House of Representative bill

8803.

Traveler
from

Altruria

How was your vacuous-
cation? Mine was a barrel of
laughs. I went home to Altruria
fully expecting to do absolutely
nothing during vacation. Ex-
cept visit old friends, take out
old girls, sip cool beers and, of
course, watch football.

When I got to my house I
opened my door expecting to be
flung into the arms of dear old
Mom and Dad. Instead I had to
step over the arms and legs and
other various appendages at-
tached to approximately ten
naked bodies. And that was just
in the kitchen. It was an orgy. In
my house! Frantically, I sear-
ched for Mom and Dad amidst
the gyrating melee. “Mom?
Dad?”’ I said, trying to peer in-
to the peoples’ faces, but
somehow missing. ‘‘Come,
come” I heard someone say,
but when I approached I found
out she didn’t want me.

Finally, a couple approached
me. I discerned from their man-
ner and their relatively greater
amount of clothing (he wore
some beads, she had a band-aid
on her toe) that they now owned
the place. ‘‘We transcend that
you relate to schizoid time-
relevant requirements of
place,’’ he said. ‘‘I didn’t use an
anti-perspirant today and I may
not use one tomorrow,” I
agreed. “By the way, where are
Mom and Dad,” I asked. ‘“They
have transcended the
quintessential womb of the
tomb,” he mumbled. ‘You
mean they’re dead?” I gasped.
“No they’ve moved to New
Jersey.’’

Thanking them, I left before
they could ask whether I would
care to stay for some tea and
crumpets. After all, I wouldn’t
have felt right asking. They
weren't expecting company.

Break-in motive

(continued from page 1)

Conner, both employees at at
the Copy Center, discovered
footprints on a table under a
window which someone had us-
ed as a way into the print shop.
Neither Conner nor McCoy
could tell whether anything had
been taken from the cabinet.
“In a place that prints over
100,000 peices of paper a day it’s
virtually impossible to keep
track of everything,” said
Keefe. Keefe said it was so ob-
vious that someone had been in
the cabinet that it would not do
the person who may have taken
copies of the exams any good
because the professors involved
simply made up new ones.
There were numerous types
of exams in the cabinet in-
cluding those from the history,
politics, economics, math,
biology and psychology depart-
ments, as well as some law ex-

“It was just a big pain for
those professors who had to
completely rewrite, type and
reprint a new exam, especially
when they weren’t even sure if
any were taken,’’ said
(Associate Dean of the College)
Robert McAhren, a history pro-
fessor. “I found out the Thurs-
day morning before the beginn-
ing of exams and had to spend a
whole day making up a new ex-
am which wasn’t nearly as good
as the first one,”’ he said.

In all, 13 of the 15 professors
who had exams in the cabinet
felt obligated to make up new
exams, said one professor, who
added that he knew of one pro-
fessor who ‘‘booby-trapped”’ his
exam just in case someone tried
to use a stolen original.

The general consesus among
professors asked was that so-
meone was looking for money
that was sometimes kept in the
cabinet as none of the exams in
the vandalized cabinet ap-
peared to be disturbed.

Saturday

classes

(continued from page 1)

When asked why all the days
were shifted instead of simply
moving Monday’s classes to
Saturday, Dean Watt replied
that this would have caused a
number or problems. One, he
said, was for those classes
which met only on Monday, this
would have meant them
meeting twice in three days,
which wouldn’t have given
those students a long enough
time to prepare for these week-
ly meetings. Watt said another
reason for doing this was
because of the fact that as few
as possible classes are schedul-
ed on Friday afternoon, mean-
ing that as few as possible
classes will be meeting on
Saturday afternoon.

Watt said that the last time
Saturday class was held was
three or four years ago. Next
year, he said, because New
Year’s Day will fall on a Mon-
day, students. will have three
weeks for Christmas break, in-
cluding one full week after New
Year’s Day.
