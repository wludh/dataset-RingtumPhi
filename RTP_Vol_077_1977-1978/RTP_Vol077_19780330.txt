Seven fraternities join block

 

‘Red Square Machine” Exposed

by Randy Smith
The Interfraternity Council
voted to remove one member of
the recently elected Judicial
Board and accepted the
resignation of another in
response to a voting conflict in
last week’s IFC election.
Madison Spencer (Sigma
Nu), elected last week as Senior
Justice, was removed from that
office, and Biff Martin (Delta
Tau Delta) resigned as one of
the Junior Justices.
The conflict arose out of the
formation of an apparent voting

‘machine’ structure among
seven fraternities, or‘anized
before the election.

“The president of the Delt
house was contacted that our
house’s votes would assure his
elected position to the Judicial
Board at last Tuesday’s IFC
election,’’ said Bill
Thistlethwaite, IFC represen-
tative for Delta Tau Delta.

Thistlethwaite further charg-
ed that the president, Biff Mar-

tin, joined into the voting block
“without notifying any member
of the house”’ or the fraternity’s
IFC representative.

Because Thistlethwaite did
not know a political deal had
been made, Martin ‘‘was allow-
ed to vote on one of the ballots in
the election,” the IFC represen-
tative explained. ‘‘Once I realiz-
ed what was going on and that
this was a pre-planned pro-
cedure, I cast the house’s vote
for the candidate I felt most
qualified,”’ he continued.

The deal was made with what
is reportedly called the ‘Red
Square Machine.”’ Represen-
tatives from Phi Kappa Sigma,
Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta,
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon allow-
ed candidates from Kappa
Alpha, Sigma Nu, and Delta
Tau Delta to join their already
established ‘‘block’’ in return
for their pledge of support for
the other machine candidates.

The ‘‘Red Square Machine”

was apparently successful, cap-

Admissions Still Down;
Trustees Interviewed

On March 16-18th the Board of
Trustees held their winter
meeting postponed in last

February because of inclement

weather in Lexington and all over
the East coast. After their final
session on Saturday Mr. S. L.
Kopald, '43 and Dr. Edgar F.
Shannon, Jr., 39 graciously con-
sented to be interviewed by the
Ring-tum Phi on the issues that
face the University. The follow-
ing is a transcript of the
highlights of that conversation.
In response. to questions on
the admissions program Mr.
Kopald admitted that as of that
date applications for admission
were r. unning 24 percent below
the normal rate. Both
gentlemen said that the Board
was concerned over this
development, but at the same
time was confident that it is not
indicative of a trend. Kopald
said, ‘“‘We’ve got to do a better
job to communicate the

academic excellence of this |

university.’’ Dr. Shannon was
hopeful that the selection of two
undergraduates (Messers.
Underhill and Putney, Phi,
3/23/78) to work in the admis-
sions department next year cer-
tainly would “strengthen that
department, Mr. Kopald did not
rule out the possibility of an out-
side agency being brought in to
assess the admissions program
and make recommendations on
its effectiveness.

Dr. Shannon said that com-
peting with the ‘best schools in
the South, and the country’
we've got to reach more kids in

high schools. I think our own
students are the best device we
have for accomplishing this.”’

Neither of Board members
would concede that coeducation
was a reason for the drop in ad-
missions. Mr. Shannon said, ‘“‘If
we suddenly admit women, I
don’t think applications for ad-
mission would dramatically
rise. Wben the Board made the
decision not to go co-ed (a
unanimous one) it did so
because it felt the quality of the
institution was _ strong.”’
However both Board members
indicated that if a point in time
comes when the Board believes
that the quality of W&L was not
strong, they might re-examine
the question of co-education. If
admission of women would im-
prove the quality of W&L,
Shannon and. Kopald both
believe that this would be an
“overwhelming” factor in favor
of co-education. In closing
Shannon said that since there
evidence to this hypothesis,
neither the board nor the ad-
ministration should look in to
the question of co-education.

In response to a question
about the need to recruit more
minorities to come to W&L, Mr.
Kopald said, ‘I can’t think of
anything that would please the
board more than getting more
black faculty and students to
come to Washington and Lee.
We have a much higher priority
on getting minorities than look-
ing into co-education.”’

Both gentlemen were in

turing six of seven IFC elected
seats last Tuesday night.

However, the deal caused
quite an uproar at the Delt
house. Martin made the deal to
give all the Delt votes to the
machine candidates in return
for his position on the ticket
without informing any of his
fraternity brothers or the IFC
representative.

Elections
by Lee Howard

Yesterday’s voting for class
officers featured many upsets,
with five candidates who had
fallen behind in the ballotting on
Monday pulling out victories
over their previously more suc-
cessfulopponents.  .

The chief of the underdogs
was freshman Jay Stewart, who
had been taken off the ballot for
sophomore class vice president
after finishing third on Monday,
only to win the office on a strong
write-in campaign.

Another surprising winner
was William Mackie, who
finished 24 votes behind incum-

SAB Movies
Shut Down

by Randy Smith -

Films scheduled by the Stu-
dent Activities Board can no
longer be shown in the duPont
auditorium Bill Tucker, chair-
man of the SAB, revealed at
Monday’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting.

The trash problem of empty
beer cans left after the weekend
movie showings was the cause
for the loss of the SAB’s movie
privilege, Tucker said.

Prof. Albert C. Gordon of the
Fine Arts Department had com-
plained about the beer can trash
problem all year, Tucker said,
but last weekend was worse
than it has been in the past.

Jim Underhill, EC president,
offered the Executive Commit-
tee’s help in solving the SAB’s
problem of where to show the
movies which have been
ordered for the remainder of
the school year.

In other action, the EC heard

In contrast to the winners on
Wednesday, Monday’s victors
were all expectable; they all
ran unopposed.

Freeman Jones became
senior class president, while
Preston Waldrop and Hagood
Morrison glided in to the posts
of senior Sciences vice presi-
dent and senior Arts vice presi-
dent, respectively.

Meanwhile, everyone on the
rising junior class ballot, all
running unopposed, were
elected. Steve Abraham and
Dee Keesler will be next year’s
junior class EC _ represen-

SAB Spring Concert
Still Up In The Air

Michael Murphy seems to be
the only ‘‘strong”’ possibility as
a performer at this year’s spr-
ing concert, according to Stu-
dent Activities Board informa-
tion available last night.

Bill Tucker, chairman of the
SAB, and his committee have
run into numerous complica-
tions in arranging the concert.
“Right now we have to start all
over,”’ Tucker said.

The Outlaws had been a

package deal considered by the
SAB to perform with Michael
Murphy. Tucker learned late
last night that The Outlaws had
been offered television ex-
posure at the Kentucky Derby
and would be unavailable for
the proposed early May concert
date at W&L. :

The Charlie Daniels Band had
been a possibility earlier in the
week, but their stage show pos-
ed many complications for the
SAB.

Tucker said that the Charlie
Daniels Band required 400
amps..to put on their show. The
gym only has 200 amps.
available so outside power
would have to be brought in.
‘‘Their show would have been
very expensive,” said Tucker
who estimated the cost of their
show to be over $17,000.

The J. Geils Band had also
been a choice, but Tucker said
the SAB put out an offer at noon
‘and by two in the afternoon,
they were gone,” having
withdrawn their offer to play at
W&L.

For five Washington and Lee
seamadarila business ad-

ministration majors, playing a
game 30 hours a week for nine
weeks has paid off.

The game was on a computer,
and the students took it 100-

ercent seriously. It was the an-

ual Emory University Inter-
collegiate Business Game, and
the result of the W&L students’
work was a first-place victory
in the consumer-electronics
segment of the computer-
simulated ‘‘economy.”

The five W&L men operated
an imaginary company called
Innovative Consumer Elec-
tronics (ICE). They produced
and distributed smoke detec-
tors ina market controlled by a
master computer at Emory in
Atlanta.

The officers of ICE were all
senior undergraduates at W&L.
Charles Hinkle was president of
the firm; Jerry Baird was vice
president in charge of
marketing; Jeffrey Sone was
sales manager; Robert Peery
was corporate accountant, and
Howard Rubel was in charge of
production. They were advised
by Dr. Joseph Goldsten,
associate professor of ad-
ministration.

ICE competed against 24
other teams, which were divid-
ed into different industries.
Each team had to guide its com-
pany through three years of
business activity regulated by
the computer.

 

The computer threw some
curve balls at the W&L team.

ICE’s products was declared il-
legal, and the W&L company
had to modify it at a cost of

 

Early in the competition one of

C-schoolers play games

$50,000. The computer also
blocked an attempt to buy out a
competitor, an important part
of the W&L strategy.

Despite the computer’s
repeated attempts to thwart the
progress of the W&L team, ICE
stayed in the black and earned a
tidy sum of its make-believe
stockholders.

The students operated their
companies by __ teletyping
management decisions twice a
week to the Emory computer.
The computer analyzed the
decisions and results were
teletyped back to each com-
peting team.

The student teams and their
advisors met in Atlanta in
March to compare their final
profits and to be judged on
game play, presentations of
business strategy and
stockholders’ reports.

Winners were decided by a
panel of men and women from
sponsoring businesses, business
school faculty and graduate
students.

An important factor in
W&L’s divisional victory was a
presentation they made to a
group of businessmen gathered
at Emory to evaluate the efforts
of the competing teams. Hinkle
said the W&L students had
predicted every question they
were asked.

Hinkle credited the teaas
preparedness to the broad
background in business they
received at W&L. He said they
were taught to deal with pro-
blems in marketing, finance
and general business practices
as well as in other areas of
business. Class time spent on
case studies also helped the
team win, he said.

 

 

Marston Says Carter Lied
Four Times About Firing

by Ken Mastrilli

“Anytime a President who
said he would never lie to us can
get up and lie at a press con-
ference four times in 10
minutes, and then say he would
do it again if he had to, then
something’s wrong,’’ said
David Marston who was fired
from his U.S. attorney’s job in
Philadelphia last Philadelphia
this January by Attorney
General Griffin Bell.

Marston, now running for the
Republican gubernatorial
nomination in Pennsylvania, a
state which he calls the most
politically corrupt in the Union,
spoke to a full house in Lee
Chapel last night.

Touching on a variety of
subjects—his firing by Presi-
dent Carter, his prosecution of
corrupt Philadelphia politicians
and his’ gubernatorial
aspirations—Marston’s speech
managed to keep the mainly
Republican audience entertain-
ed.

Marston said his now con-
troversial firing was prompted
by a phone call from Penn-
sylvania state representative
Daniel Eilberg to Griffin Bell in
which Eilberg urged the prompt
removal of Marston, and, ac-
cording to Marston, didn’t even
have anyone in mind to replace
him.

“Tf it boils down to a question
of whether any one is above the
law, and to a question of right
and wrong,’ said Marston,
“Anytime a congressman can
call the President and get an ef-
fective federal prosecutor out of
office then something’s wrong.”’

Two W&L Department Heads
Leave Posts to Coulling, Nye

Drs. Sidney M. B. Coulling
and Thomas G. Nye have been
appointed heads of Washington
and Lee University’s English
and biology departments,
respectively, effective July 1.
They succeed Drs. Severn
Duvall and James H. Starling.

The appointments were an-
nounced by W&L President
Robert E. R. Huntley following
Saturday’s meeting of the
university Board of Trustees.

Both Duvall and Starling will
return to full-time classroom
teaching.

Coulling, a 1948 B.A. graduate
of Washington and Lee, receiv-
ed his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
from the University of North
Carolina. Before joining the
W&L faculty in 1956, he taught
at Florida State University and
at the University of Maryland.

An authority in Victorian
literature, Coulling is the
author of ‘‘Matthew Arnold and
his Critics,” published in 1974
by Ohio University Press, and
described in a London Times
Literary Supplement review as
‘a detailed, sustained and. il-
luminating picture.”’

Nye has taught at Washington
and Lee since 1966. He earned
his undergraduate degree in
biology and social sciences at
Fairmont (W. Va.) State Col-

lege and his advanced degrees
at the University of Kentucky.

His fields of teaching and
research specialty are ecology
and general botany. The author
of a number of scholarly arti-
cle,, Nye’s most recent publica-
tion is a teaching guide, ‘The
Trees of W&L,”’ published this
year by the university.

Duvall is Henry S. Fox Jr.
Professor of English, one of six
endowed professorships at the
university. He expressed a
strong desire to relinquish his
departmental administrative
duties after 16 years, Huntley
said. Duvall joined the W&L
faculty as full professor and
department head in 1962 after
teaching English at Dartmouth
for nine years.

He received his A.B. degree

       
   
   
     

 

_ The University Snack

from the University of Virginia
and his master’s and Ph.D.
degrees from Princeton. He is
an authority on the subject of
the Southern romance.

Starling is 65, the mandatory
retirement age for department
heads. He has been a member
of the biology faculty at
Washington and Lee since 1942.
He was acting department head
for a time following the death in
1974 of Dr. Henry S. Roberts,
and became permanent depart-
ment head in 1976.

He earned his bachelor’s and
master’s degrees from the
University of Alabama and his
Ph.D. in zoology and ecology
from Duke. His fields of
teaching are general zoology,
anatomy, and the study of
parasites.

showed that Eilberg was under
investigation at the time of the
firing. It’s. still uncertain
whether Carter knew about the
Eilberg investigation although
according to Marston, both
Carter and Griffin Bell ignored
a petition signed by 40,000 Penn-
sylvania voters saying that
Marston should not befired and
that he was doing a good job.

Marston said Bell told him the
firing was purely a matter
political patronage, and tried to
elicit from Bell a reason for his
dismiss. Bell admitted Marston
had done a good job and had not
used his office for political
gains but that it was simply
tradition to replace Marston,
Republican, with a Democrat.

This went against President
Carter’s promise to de-
politicize the Justice Depart-
ment, said Marston. ‘‘There’s
no room for politics in the
Justice Department,’’ said
Marston,’’ and when you can
pull strings in Washington to try
and do so then it has ominous
implications for any federal law
enforcement agency.”

Marston, now earning$60,000
a year as counsel for a big
Philadelphia law firm, said he
feels he is getting paid what he
deserves and did not use his
publicity to land him a good job.
‘‘ T see nothing unethical about
going back to work for a law
firm I’ve been working for a
long time,” he said in answer to
a question as to how he had got-
ten such a good paying job with
so few obligations. ‘In a big law
firm it’s not unusual at all,”’ he
said.

Marston, who as U.S, at-
torney got two of Penn-
sylvania’s most prominent
politician convicted on charges
of influence peddling and mail
fraud, said he used two power-
ful tools in getting evidence for
his investigations into political
corruption. Consensual
monitoring and the granting of
immunity to witnesses so they
would be forced to testify and
not hide behind the Fifth
Amendment which guards
against — self-incrimination,
were his most favorite and ef-
feti effective weapons.

‘As federal prosecutors we
were able to investigate the
white-collar crime better than
the local attorneys,’’ said
Marston. Marston added that
white-collar crime in America
such as influence peddling has

200 times more economic im-
pact than all the bank robberies
put together. :

Marston said that most of the
cases involving influence peddl-
ing are related to people trying
to buy influence with state
politic politicians so their
children can get into profes-
sional schools. ‘‘Other times
you get some disgruntled tax-
payer who calls up and says he
had to pay some politician
$10,000 to do a job he should or-
dinarily be doing for free,” said
Marston.

By consensual monitoring
Marston said he can get record-
ed evidence of an actual tran-
saction between a ‘‘bag man”
and some political official that
can be used in court.’’ There’s
no invasion of privacy here
because of the consent of one of
the individuals involved, and
this gives us good concrete
evidence that some state of-
ficial can’t refute in court,”
said Marston. Marston said
otherwise the suspected but
normally respected public of-
ficial can get up in court and
say he’s the victim of character
assasination at the hands of
some “‘bag man’’ who may have
a long list of convictions on his
record.

“If that was the case then the
jury would surely take the word
of a “respected official’ over
that of some criminal,” said
Marston.

Marston said it was very easy
to find corruption in Penn-
sylvania, ‘‘because there was so
much raw material to work
with.”” Marston credited much
of his success to the work of Neil
Walsh, whom Marston praised
as being the best FBI man in the
country. Walsh’s son Chris, a
W&L sophomore, introduced
Marston to the audience.

In response to a recent col-
umn by Jack Anderson which
said that many of Marston’s
former employess felt Marston
had used his office as a spr-
ingboard to higher political
plateaus, Marston said he
figured there would be a lot of
unhappy people once he got
through with his shake-up of
was earlier a “happy but
mediocre office.’’

_ “There was little or no com-
petition in the office,” said
Marston, and it may have made
some people mad when I got rid
of 23 of the 40 attorneys in the of-

‘Looking for Mr. Goodbar”’
The Land of Oz

 

by Seth Oserin

In the 1960’s, the American
public was snowed with the
total antithesis of Hollywood’s
fantasy-feeding function. The
film capital concentrated on
what life “‘is’’ and not what life
‘‘should be,’’ as it did during the
previous 40 years. A new breed
of writer emerged in the
guiltridden society of the 1960’s,
one that concentrated on reflec-
ting America’s. often
hypocritical values.

The average. filmgoer
couldn’t hide from these pro-
ductions. Ranging from
‘Clockwork Orange’ and
‘Catch 22”’ to Stanley Kubrick’s
“2001: A Space Odyssey,”
school was brought to the movie
theatre in a rather unconven-
tional manner. As a result, peo-
ple were finding it difficult to
relax in the theatre (to think is
not entertaining) and thus at-
tendance started to drop.

In essence, ‘Looking for Mr.
Goodbar”’ is the culmination of
Hollywood’s 15 years of
developing a credible presenta-
tion of life (or at any rate, its
more unpleasant and seamy

Company

to perform

It is always a bit refreshing to
have variety in the theatre
season of Lexington. Indeed,
the University Theatre has gone
a long way toward meeting this
goal during the present year;
we have seen Restoration and
modern comedies, classical and
American tragedies, and even
some minor shows from the
‘angry theatre’ series.

Playing next Tuesday at 8:00
PM and Wednesday at 1:00 PM
is the Dobja Dance Company,
another welcomed group for
variety on the stage.

The company has been form-
ed to experiment with new
types of ballet and mime, in an
attempt to combine the two im-
pressionistically. Their
brochure states that they are
abstract in form, but they are
concrete in expression. Even
though this sounds extremely
ambiguous, they have played to
large crowds and amassed a
number of good reviews. In the
Same school as the Warsaw
Mime Company, which played
here earlier this year, it will be
interesting to see where they
have divided in style and exper-
tise.

This type of production - as
educational as it is different -
should not be missed at the
theatre next week. After all, a
group of this magnitude doesn’t
come around too often.

  
 

   

 

sides). Director Richard
Brooks takes a script that has
everything but the film to put it
on, and presents an adequate
reflection of the present genera-
tion’s frustrations and desires.
Although one cannot relate all
the trials that Theresa (Diane
Keaton) encounters, the basic
sociological problems and
disappointments are easily
associated to true life.

Director Brooks should be
considered another casualty of
Hollywood politics, as he was
passed over for a well-deserved
Oscar nomination. He handles a
complex screenplay with an in-
credible insight into the script
and its characters. Theresa’s
fantasies are intermingled with
reality, with such sharpness
and perfection that the viewer
becomes’ extraordinarily
caught up into her character -- a
feat that is all too rarely ac-

complished in present-day
Hollywood.

Editing was excellent, and

receive an Oscar (the film got 2
nominations) for Best
Cinematography.

Tuesday Weld received a
nomination for Best Supporting
Actress as Theresa’s sister--
perhaps the least deserved of
all the possible nominations the
film could have been given.

However, the woman of the
hour is Diane Keaton, who
deserves , in addition to her role
in “Annie Hall,”’ a nomination
for her presentation of the
frustrated, reckless college
graduate trying to cope with the
pressures of the accelerated
social malaise that is typical of
New York City.

Those who considered ‘‘Satur-
day Night Fever’ a true slice of
New York life are only swallow-
ing sacharrin.

And those who find it difficult
to relate to the life style
presented by this film are mere-
ly lost in the depths of sheltered
naivete.

THE

Tennis Team No. l

RING-TUM PHI

in Division Ill

by Mike Farrand

The nation’s number one ten-
nis team in Division III has
played three matches in the
past week and pulled its overall
record from 3-2 to 4-4. The
record, however, shows
strength in the opposing teams
and not weakness in
Washington and Lee’s.

First came the match with
the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill last
Thursday. W&L admittedly,
did not have much chance
against the tennis excellence of
this Division I school. Ben
Johns went down to U.N.C.’s
Earl Hassler 6-1, 6-3; Stewart
Jackson was defeated by Junie
Chatman 6-1, 6-1; Cody Davis
was lashed 6-1, 6-1 by Cliff
Skakle; David Constine, mean-
while, was subdued by Gary
Taxman 6-2, 6-2. Because of
Robert Schuler’s absence, Doug
Gaker played number five and
fell to Jon Kraut 6-1, 6-2. Pat
Norris filled in the last spot on
the ladder and strongly pressed
Tal Henry in the first set but
went on to lose 7-5, 6-0. The
scores are rather unimpressive
but one must realize that Coach
Bussard dubbed the Tar Heels
as ‘‘definitely the toughest team
we've ever played.”

On home courts the following
day the Generals faired much
better, defeating Pittsburgh 8-1.
Pittsburgh stole only one vic-
tory point from W&L as Ben
Johns was sent to the bench
with a 6-3, 7-5 loss to Tom
Leibenguth. Stewart Jackson
downed Bill Pilardi but only
after winning a tiebreaker in
the second set — 6-1, 7-6 (5-2).
Cody Davis whipped Kevin
Quay 6-4, 6-2; Constine
steamrolled George Hoffman
6-0, 6-1, while Schuler did a
similiar job on his opponent
(Joe Mayers) on the adjoining
court; Gaker also entered the
victory circle with a 6-4, 6-3 win
over Doug White. In doubles the

results were much the same as
Johns (avvenging his singles
loss) teamed up with Jackson to
defeat Tom Leibenguth and
Pilardi 6-4, 6-4. Pat Norris and
Doug Gaker were in dire shape
(down 3-6, 2-3) before they won
by default as one of their op-
ponents collapsed with a hurt
ankle. Kell Ryan and David
Constine completed W&L’s
dominance over Pittsburgh
with a 6-0, 6-1 victory over
Mayers and Kepner.

Michigan State drove away
from Lexington Monday even-
ing with a 7-2 win over the
Generals. Tighe Keating
defeated Ben Johns 6-4, 6-3;
Kevin McNulty won over
Stewart Jackson 6-4, 6-3; Cody
Davis put up an commendable
fight against Steve Klemm
before losing 6-4, 3-6, 6-3; Matt
Sandler felled David Constine
6-3, 6-1; and Doug Gaker was
downed by Frank Willard 6-2,
6-0. The bright star for the
Generals on Monday was the
fifth man, Robert Schuler, who
annihilated his opponent, Steve
Heitzner, 6-3, 6-3. He later join-
ed with Doug Gaker to outlast,
with superhuman effort, the
Heitzner-Willard doubles team
in an extremely tense match
which was finally decided by
the score of 5-7, 7-6 (5-4), 7-6
(5-1). (Had Gaker and Schuler
lost the ninth point in the
second-set tiebreaker they
would have left the court in
defeat—needless to say they
won the point and the match.)
Other doubles scores were
Keating-McNulty over W&L’s
Johns-Jackson 3-6, 3-6 6-3, and
Klemm-Sandler over W&L’s
Davis-Norris 6-3, 6-2.

‘Now is the time to be self-
critical,’ states Coach Bussard,
‘I’m not sure that we're accru-
ing the expected benefits from
our tough schedule. Let's face
it, when we play the likes of
U.N.C. we are the under-dogs.

Golfers Beat
Lynchburg

by Charles Adler
Behind the one-under-par per-
formance of Dave Leunig, the
Washington and Lee golf team
won an important ODAC con-
test over Lynchburg on Tues-

day by a score of 389-400.
Leunig, who turned in a 70 tor
the day, was followed by team-
mate Jerry Maatman, who shot
a 76. Bo Moorehead, Andy. Fit-

zgerald and Terry Shadrick
also had zood-rounds tor W&L.
The golf team has now compiled
an undefeated record of 3-0.

The next match tor the
golferswill bu during Spring
break against Virginia Com-
monwealth University. W&L
will compete in the William and
Mary Classic at King’s Mill
following the match with VCU.

Team analyzed:

Lacrosse team beats UNC
now ranked 11th in country

W&L’s lacrosse team scored
their biggest win of the season
so far upending the sixth ranked
Tar Heels of North Carolina 6-4
last Saturday. The victory
catipulted the Generals from
their fifteenth ranking to their
current ranking of eleventh in
the nation.

Although the game was
played on a tain-soaked Wilson
Field, the quality of lacrosse
was still good. Neither team is
an offensive powerhouse. UNC
had previously lost a 9-8 deci-
sion to UVA. The Generals
reversed that score against
Towson.

Junior honorable mention All-
American attackman Jeff Fritz
had five of W&L’s six goals. He
scored two goals and tallied
three assists. Other scorers in-
cluded Jay Sindler, Jay Foster,

Track Team 3-1 after

John Black, and John Kemp.
Kemp and Black also recorded
assists for the Generals.

Charlie Brown had 11 saves
allowing only four goals. Coach
Emmer said prior to the game
that W&L had to take ad-
vantage of Carolina penalties to
win the game, and that they did
scorin scoring on four of nine
extra man situations. Carolina
was 0 of 2 on EM sitations keep-
ing W&L’s streak of not allow-
ing a man down goal all season
in tact.

Analysis

Perhaps the real reason for
the Generals success lies more
in North Carolina’s inability to
translate the quality and ex-

perience they have on their
team into a winning unit. With
eight out of ten starters on their
team seniors, it's unusual: for

such a team to display the
disourganization that North
Carolina did last Saturday.
Although they only received one
unsportsmanlike conduct penal-
ty, usually indicative of a
breakdown in communication
and leadership on the field. The
Tar Heels were lacking in this
department throughout the
game. This has the effect of
making it difficult for a team to
stage a rally to come from
behind.

A possible reason for this
breakdown on the field is the
lack of leadership
demonstrated from the coach
on the sidelines. If Coach Doty

Lynchburg loss
puts Generals at 0-5

by Warren Crowdus
After being pummeled by the
lopsided margin of 21-2 last
Thursday in Lynchburg by the
Lynchburg Hornets. the
Generals’ baseball squad
returned to Smith Field yester-
day and were beaten again by
the same team, 15-1. The talent
laden Hornets were led by the
five-hit pitching of Ken Shiflett,
and the awesome hitting of
‘Duke’ Snider. The Generals
were simply overmatched in

every phase of the game.
Snider, the Lynchburg first
baseman, paced a 16 hit attack

with two home runs and a dou-
ble, driving in four runs. The en-
tire Hornet team murdered
W&L pitchers, hitting safely in
every inning except the sixth.

Meanwhile, the General of-
fense was kept under wraps for
most of the afternoon by a com-
bination of bad luck ‘several
line drives were hit right at
Hornet fielders), good pitching
and solid fielding, particularly
by the Lynchburg shortstop.
The single run that the Generals
tallied was unearned.

The only -bright spot in an
otherwise dismal afternoon for

W&L was the hitting of
freshman Dan Kingman. who
was two for four and was robb-
ed of a third hit in the ninth
when his line drive was snared
by the~ Lynchburg third
baseman. Also, Mike Busbey
doubled and drew two walks in
his three plate appearances.

The defeat dropped the
General record to 0-5. They are
idle until next weekend, when
they will host Bluefield. Bristol

prentice in the Washington and
Lee Invitational Tournament.

North Carolina's coach, gave

that order.

by Alan Pryor

The Washington and Lee
Rugby Club has started off the
Spring season with a 1-2 record.
Their first home match is
scheduled for Sunday, April 23.
against the Charleston, West
Virginia Club.

Early season losses for the
rugby club have come against
UNC at Greensboro and Lyn-
chburg College while the win
was over Hampden-Sydney.
The club hopes to play about six
more matches this spring with
two or three of those games be-
ing at home. Club president Bev
Mauck said that the club wants

to end the season with a “spot in

‘the Virginia) Commonwealth
Tournament.”

The Rugby Club wili remaina
club because of the tact that

there ‘is no intercollegiate
league. The existing setup does
not even require a team to show
up for a match Mauck explain-
ed. He went on to will vary trom

players to each practice. Due to

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Temperance, Gentlemen

It’s about time that some people on campus grow up and start ac-
ting responsibly. There is a segment of the student population that
believes intoxication and its effects are inconsequential.-To anyone
in a clear state of mind that should be obviously wrong. Whether
these inebriated few realize it or not, their actions are detremental
to the student body and the reputation of the University.

The effects range from the SAB being thrown of duPont
auditorium because it was trashed with beer cans, to an article in
the Washington Post after fancy dress depicting W&L as a collec-
tion of skid row sots. There's little doubt that this hurt recruiting.
The effects are prevalent in the world of university sports. W&L
lacrosse fans have the reputation of being hearty ardent supporters
of their team. Unfortunately they have also garnered the reputa-
tion for being an obnoxious bottle-throwing mob. For the latter
reason some of our long-time lacrosse opponents, notably the Naval
Academy, refuse to play us.

Perhaps the saddest commentary on this subject is the fact that a
state of intoxication can ignite an incident between two W&L
students, where one could have been permanently maimed, or
fatally injured. When drunkenness reaches these proportions it’s
time for everyone to be concerned.

W&L’s rites of spring are considered by some to be rights to
revelry. Before one descends on the local girls’ schools or Wilson
Field, consider the possible consequences of your inebriation and
its subsequent reflection on the University. Confine debauchery to
your private residences where it likely to be only self-destructive.

Today the Rubicon is likely to be crossed in the University Coun-
cil meeting. The Student Affairs Committee is seeking the power to
change the severity of any penalty which the Student Control Com-
mittee has decided to impose. The faculty and administration
members of SAC may not realize the adverse consequences that
this act can inspire.

It certainly questions the philosophy that students can capably
handle their own affairs. This step could be the precedent for more
onerous acts.

With the knowledge that SAC could ultimately judge a case that
SCC is investigating’ will Student Control compromise their in-
quiry, anticipating a judgement from SAC, that would render a
penalty the SCC feels either too severe or inadequate? Such an
alternative is the only check the SCC would have on the SAC.

SAC’s mentality is analagous to the overbearing parent who
never gives the child the taste of responsibility, yet still expects
him to act responsibly.

One wonders why SAC members believe that they are better
judges of what is right and wrong than students.

‘Alas, poor Lee, I knew him, Horatio”’

It is not often that a newspaper takes the step of praising a
member of its own fold. Such an action is often viewed as being self-
serving and hollow. Nothing could be further from the truth when
we applaud Lee Howard's contribution to the Ring-tum Phiand the
Washington and Lee community. Mr. Howard, a senior journalism
major, will be spending his Spring term in Massachusetts as an in-
tern on a newspaper. As this is the last Phi he will have a hand in
assembling, it is an opportune time to assess his contribution.

Lee has exhibited the highest journalistic standards in his work.
He has been thorough, impartial, and dedicated in his pursuit of the
news and his writings. On numerous occasions he has sacrificed his
schoolwork to take on another assignment that someone else has
dropped. No plaudits can really equal the sacrifices he has made
for the Phi,

Regrettably he is viewed by some as having been a member of an
editorial conspiracy ‘‘out to get’’ certain elements of the student
population. There is no greater folly than believing in this. Howard
never used his power in a vindictive manner. His reporting always
had the best interests of the student body in mind. :

This year’s Ring-tum Phi has benefited immensely from Lee’s
presence. The Phi could not have been the success it has been
without him.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry
Levon Helm flops elsewhere;

not “egg’’actly Tucker’s fault

Dear Editor:

When one notices egg on his
face in a public fashion, it is
somewhat comforting to be able
to look at a peer in comparable
situation and see egg on his face
too. The cancellation of the
Levon Helm concert was
discomforting to the SAB and a
disappointment to the W&L stu-
dent body. But when a school
the size of
VirginiaCommonwealth (enroll
ment--about 18,000) is put in a
similar position of cancelling
Levon Helm just one week after
W&L’s cancellation, one con-
clusion can be made: Levon
Helm does not sell well in the
state of Virginia.

I talked with the head of
VCU’s equivalent of the SAB
and asked her about
background knowledge on their
promotion of Levon Helm. She
said that starting three weeks in
advance, VCU had daily broad-
casts on five Richmond stations
in the form of bulletin an-
nouncements. Four hundred
and fifty dollars worth of hand-
bills and posters were cir-
culated two weeks in advance.
The week of the concert, two
hundred dollars worth of paid
radio advertisements were
broadcast three times a day.
(This can be contrasted with the
SAB posting publicity and air-
ing radio transmissions just one
week before the concert). The
end result? VCU sold 60 tickets
in advance compared with our
sales of 72. A poor showing in-
deed for a $6,500 act. Levon
Helm sounds fine on paper and
on records, but the bottom line
on concerts is not sound, but
sales and Levon does not pass
the test on that subject.

This can also attest to the fact
that this has been an unusually
taxing year in entertainment,
as our increasing number of
visitors to SAB meetings can
verify. Levon Helm type acts
are more available than the
Charlie Daniels, the Marshall

Tuckers and the Outlaws. We
have to accept what the enter-
tainment market offers to a
school this size without an
auditorium of any proportion. I
am not trying to put a damper
on enthusiasm for spring con-
cert, but if you are dreaming
about Linda Ronstadt or a
Bruce Springsteen, keep on
dreaming. If you would like to
be informed to what is happen-
ing to SAB, come to our Sunday
night meetings at 7:00 in room
208 in the University Center.
But remember one thing: Lack
of input from you as a student
means that you forfeit your
right to complain when a deci-
sion is made.

The SAB can complain about
the amount of egg that has ac-
cumulated on its face this year ;
some of it deserved, some of it
not. Students can blame SAB
for scheduling, and subsequent-
ly having to cancel Levon Helm
two weeks ago’ The SAB can
blame the students for not sup-
porting what is obviously an ex-
tremely talented group, albeit a
group that does not sell well.
Egg can be thrown in both the
direction of students and the

SAB until a mass of congealed
mess cuts off communication
and effectively disconnects in-
put from each other.

That would not ‘‘egg’ actly be
a desireable solution, but it
could happen. What is a solu-
tion? More involvement by
Students in student activities.
The unusually large voter tur-
nout this spring is a good sign of
revitalized student interest in
campus politics. An even
greater sign would be for
students to do something more
than just vote for officers but to
actually participate in subcom-
mittees-of the student body as
voting and working members.
As a member of this year’s SAB
and next year’s EC, I would
urge all students to consider ap-
plying for some subcommittee
of the EC this spring term. Look
for the signs that will go up and
apply then. But there is always
one drawback to this sort of
thing, if you are a part of a
decision-making committee
and fail to register your input,
you lose your ability to com-
plain.
Sincerely,
Bill Tucker

Seven frats join voting block

(continued from page 1)

Thursday, it was decided by the
Delt membership that Martin
should resign from the IFC
Judicial Board, and an effort
should be made to have the en-
tire election nullified because
Martin cast a Delt vote in the
election. The IFC voting by-
laws allow for only IFC
representatives to vote in the
election.

Martin resigned at a specially
called Interfraternity Council
meeting Tuesday night. ‘‘I join-
ed the Red Square voting block
without asking the members of
my fraternity,’’ he explained.

“The IFC should not be
predecided,’’ said
Thistlethwaite, ‘‘because it is
supposed to be a representative
body.’’ He called the ‘‘block’’ a
“secretive organization.”

His criticism of the “block’’
was countered by an IFC
representative, John Bruch,
who said “‘five or six frater-
nities were just pooling their
sentiments; that’s just
politics.”

Thistlethwaite also argued
that Martin’s vote in the IFC
election ‘may have had a ge-
nuine effect on the outcome of
the election.’’ He said Martin
had voted in the Senior Justice
election in which Madison
Spencer (Sigma Nu) defeated

Fraiser Humphreys (Sigma
Chi) 8-6. A Delt vote for Hum-
phreys would have tied the elec-
tion.

Technically, according to the
IFC by-laws, Martin could not
have cast a vote in the election
with Thistlethwaite there to
cast the Delt votes.

IFC President Jim Davis call-
ed the election an “unfortunate
situation.’’ He added, however,
‘*T don’t think (Martin’s vote) is
a problem to be handled by this
committee.”’

Davis further argued against
a recall of all the elected posi-
tions by noting that ‘‘these peo-
ple are in office and need to
start working together.”

“It was a violation of the by-
laws’’ for Martin to vote in the
elections, Davis conceded. But
he characterized the attempt to
recall the entire election ‘‘a
shaky issue.”

A motion introduced by the
IFC representative from Sigma
Chi to recall the entire election
was watered down to a recall of
Madison Spencer’s Senior
Justice position.

In a showdown vote on the
issue, Spencer was removed
from office by a vote of 9-5-1.

retain Spencer. Kappa Alpha,
which joined the ‘‘Red Square
Machine” after the election for
IFC president and vice- presi-
dent, abstained on the vote.

New elections for the two va-
cant offices will be held after
Spring break. Spencer may
seek reelection.

Unlike the elections last
week, nominations will be taken
the first week of the spring
term, with the elections the
following week to give fraterni-
ty members a bigger voice in
the election. Last week,
nominations and elections were
on the same night.

There was considerable
resentment among the
memberships of some non-
block fraternities about the for-
mation of a political machine to
assure the election of certain
candidates.

IFC President Jim Davis (Phi
Kappa Sigma) said “‘the pur-
pose of the block was not bad.”’
He said the fraternities in the
block had nominated ‘‘their
best men.”

Davis added, however, ‘I
think Phi Kap was made an ex-
ample of this year. We have got-
ten unfair punishment all
year.” As a result, the Phi Kaps
made a determined effort to
gain more influence in various
student organizations, he ex-
plained.

Davis also said that he had at-
tended the second block
meeting to organize last week’s
“machine” vote, although he
had already been elected IFC
President. ‘‘I sat there and wat-
ched the whole thing,’”’ Davis
said, ‘‘and did not participate.”’

There is talk of a temporary
‘“counter-block”’ being formed
by the non-block fraternities for
the election after spring break.
Its purpose is apparently to en-
sure that non-block houses have

-a Say in IFC policy next year.

and that there are no im-
proprieties in the levying of
fines against non-block houses.

To allay fears of unfair
“block” rulings through their
control of the IFC, Davis said,
“we aren’t going to start slan-
ting fines away from the
block.”

Davis also expressed the fear
that the ‘“‘Red Square Machine”’
issue would “‘split the IFC down
the middle’’ rendering the com-
mittee ineffective in dealing
with fraternity problems.

Jim Davis, newly elected IFC
president, has admitted that
members of his fraternity, Phi
Kappa Sigma, felt they had
received ‘‘unfair punishment”’
this year from many sides.

The SAEs also felt they had
come under extraordinary
criticism this year.

It was only natural, then, for
the two to come to an
understanding that they should
unite in a concerted effort to
capture the seats of control in
the various branches of student
government for next year.

How the “Machine” worked

 

News Analysis

 

That their planning has been
successful is evident in the
results of this week’s class elec-
tions and last week’s IFC elec-
tions.

Originally, the ““Red Square
Machine” was made up of Phi
Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon, Phi Delta Theta, and Beta
Theta Pi.

Jim Davis (Phi Kap) and
Rich Huck (Beta) were the
voting block’s candidates in the
fraternity membership-wide
elections for IFC president and
vice-president.

Much to their credit, those
four fraternities got out the vote
in the election and got their can-
didates into office.

But the IFC elections for
secretary, treasurer, rush and
social chairmen, and three
Judicial Board justices posed a
different problem: those posi-
tions were elected only by the
fraternity representatives to

 

 

the IFC--each house casting two
votes.

In order for SAE Fred Moore
and Phi Delt Syd Farrar to win
Junior Justice and secretary,
the block had to be expanded.

Three fraternities were added
to the block: Kappa Alpha,
Delta Tau Delta, and Sigma Nu.

  

    

In return for a place on the
block ticket, each fraternity
new to the block pledged their
votes for the other “machine”
candidates. The block then had
the clout to control what proved
to be a confusing election.

As it turned out, the block won
six of seven available positions-
-three candidates were unop-
posed. The unity of the block
collapsed on the vote for rush
chairman when the Delts and
the SNus bolted the group and
voted for other candidates
(which explains how Pi Phi
Chris Volk was elected IFC
Rush Chairman).

Bill Thistlethwaite’ the Delt
IFC representative instumental
in exposing the ‘‘machine’s”’ ex-
istence, does not believe the for-
mation of a voting block is
unethical. ‘“‘You have to admire
their ability to mobilize such a
large voting force,” he said.

What injured the ‘‘Red
Square Machine”’ was that two
fraternities pledged their sup-
port without the full member-
ship being aware of the situa-
tion. Hence, Thistlethwaite’s
argument that the election was
“not representative’ of true
fraternity sentiments.

The voting block controversy

also illuminated the ‘‘am-
biguous’’ voting procedures
prescribed in the IFC by-laws.
Davis has promised to revise
those ‘‘ambiguities”’ this spring
and hopefully eliminate some of
the gross problems which
became apparent in this affair.
‘ Indications are that a
“‘counter-block”’ will be formed
to off-set the influence of what
remains of the “Red Square
Machine.”

This makes sense because
eventhough Davis has assured
that ‘“‘we aren’t going to start
slanting fines away from the
block,” the non-block frater-
nities want to guarantee
fairness by being represented in

routine report.like those given
by other committees,’’ EC vice
president George Griffin said
before Ring-tum Phi business
manager Peter Goss gave his
financial report.

Goss said the student
newspaper would be ‘very
close to a break-even point this
year.”

Although he placed the
balance of the Ring-tumPhi’s
budget at approximately $2,300,
he said “advertising revenue
drops off at this time of year.”
Non-printing costs added to his
calculated future expenses for
the newspaper.

Jeff Bird, treasurer of the
Publications Board, reported
the balance of the board’s
budget to be $6,994. He said the
committee which oversees all
student-run publications had
spent only about $200 this year.

Underhill objected to an $8
bill from White Front Super-
market for snacks purchased
during last year’s three-hour
session to choose this year’s
editors and business managers.

In discussing the use of stu-
dent body funds to pay for
refreshments, Underhill said,
“We don’t do it; I don’t think
you should either.”’

Griffin added, ‘If a commit-
tee wants to have a party, they
can come to the EC meeting for

permission’ (because EC
meetings are open).
“F gent think it’s

unreasonable for the Publica-
tions Board to spend seven or
eight dollars on snacks over the
course of the year,’’ replied
Bird. He received formal per-
mission for the board to again
have refreshments this year.
The vote was unanimous.

The University Center Com-
mittee requested $600 to provide
entertainment in the Cockpit
during the spring term.

Because the EC has already
given that committee more
than $3,200 for entertainment in
the Cockpit this year, they were
asked to return in the spring
with a specific request. ‘We
want to give money to specific
things,” Griffin said.
