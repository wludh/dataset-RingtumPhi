Administration
“Removes” Papers

In a statement released late
Monday afternoon, administra-
tion officials admitted remov-
ing some of last week’s con-
troversialRing-tum Phis.

The carefully worded state-
ment made a distinction bet-
ween the administration’s ac-
tion and actual confiscation of
the student newspaper.

Only the “‘handfull’’ of papers
which were still in the Student
Center Friday afternoon were
‘removed to the Office of the
Director of the Student Center,”
the administration statement
said.

Between ‘‘50 and 75”’ copies of
the Rank-tam Poon were
gathered up by Student Center
Director Michael Cappeto ac-
ting on a telephone call from
Robert S. Keefe, director of the
University News Office.

Keefe said that he ordered the

newspapers be removed
because parents of prospective
students visiting the school
were obtaining copies. Keefe
verified his action with Lewis
John, Dean of Students, after he
had ordered Cappeto to remove
the lampoon issues.

“The administration will

reserve the same right to act
again as they did last week,”’
Keefe said in an interview Tues-
day.

“This does not reflect a new
set of values that the ad-
ministration has suddenly
adopted,”’ he said, noting that
the administration would not
take similar action in the future
“casually.”

Keefe cited ‘two formal
associations’”’ which the ad-
ministration views as giving
them the right to. remove the

Harry Chapin to
perform May 11

by M. Gray Coleman

Harry Chapin - famous
singer, songwriter, and
nominee for both the Oscar and
the Grammy Awards - has been
signed by the Student Activities
Board to perform at
Washington and Lee on Thurs-
day, May 11. The concert, which
guarantees two hours or more
of solid Chapin entertainment,
will take place in Doremus
Gymnasium at 8pm. Tickets
are scheduled to go on sale by
Monday, May 8, outside Mike
Cappetto’s office in the Student
Center. Ticket price for the ad-
vance sale will be $4; tickets at
the door will be $5.

Applauded by newspapers
and critics across the country
as ‘‘one of the most creative
songwriters of this decade or
any decade,” Chapin’s hits

range from “‘Circle”’ to ‘‘Cat’s
In The Cradle.’’ Especially
renowned as a storyteller in
song, Chapin is noted for his
portrayals in song of real peo-

_ ple, with problems that his au-

dience can respond to - as one
newspaper said, “Chapin is a
magician who builds pictures of
happiness or tragedy with his
music. It’s nice to know there is
still a singer-songwriter who
hasn’t lost touch with the mor-
tals on the streets. One who
hasn’t had all his rough edges
smoothed and can still write
about more than juvenile hear-
tache.”’

The Chapin concert is indeed
a rare effort on the part of the
SAB to bring to campus a “big
name” performer. This affair is
inten intended to take the place

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent and a visiting friend were
the victims of a fatal
automobile accident this
weekend. Dead are sophomore
Walter Lee Sneed and Coby E.
Leet, a University of Oklahoma
graduate. The two were driving
west on Route 60 shortly after
11:00 p.m. Saturday night when
Leet lost control of the vehicle
he was driving and struck a tree
several miles out of Lexington.

Walter, who would be 20 on

 

_ Student killed in Crash

Sunday, was born and resided
in Oklahoma City. He is surviv-
ed by his parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Lee V. Sneed, Jr. and a sister,
all of Oklahoma City. An Honor
Roll student, Walter was a
pledge of Lambda Chi Alpha
social fraternity.

A memorial service was held
this week in Lee Chapel.
Funeral services were held
Wednesday afternoon at the
Capitol Hill Funeral Home in
Oklahoma City.

 

 

Last week’s edition of the
Ring-tum Phi caused a con-
troversy which reverberated
across the state. Much attention
was directed to the paper’s
‘“Jampoon”’ section, the Rank-
tam Poon.

The joke issue, the first in
several years, was labeled
“distasteful, disgusting and a
disgrace to the University”’ in a
statement released by ad-
ministration officials the day
after publication.

Of particular concern to
University officials were: an
editorial cartoon which
graphically depicted a common
fraternity party activity called
“gatoring”; a detailed article
on campus bathroom graffitti;
the two word editorial opinion of
the Rank-tam Poon; and a
mock sports story, ‘“‘Wrestlers
lose to Sin.”

University response to the
newspaper was to revoke the
third class postal permit for
that issue and to “remove”
50-75 copies of the Rank-tam
Poon from the Student Center
Friday afternoon.

J. Michael Gallagher, editor
of the Ring-tum Phi, responded
to the administration’s action
by saying, “They tell us it’s our
publication, but we_ print
something they don’t like and

 

: = ileal ii ies

they confiscate it. I’m surprised
they didn’t have the copies
burned on the collonade.”’

Gallagher said that the paper
is ‘‘supposed to be independent
of direct control by the faculty
or administration.”’

“The University took no ac-
tion to prevent the Ring-tum
Phi from reaching students. At
no time was it stated or sug-
gested that distribution not in-
volving University facilities
would be disallowed ,”’ said an
administration statement
released late Monday after-

noon.

RtP Road Race

by Jerry Harris

The Second Annual Ring-tum
Phi Road Race will be held in
Lexington this Sunday, April 30,
starting at 9:00 a.m. The gruel-
ing long-distance run is ex-
pected to draw a larger group of
entrants this year than the first
RtP Road Race which was
termed a_ success by _ its
originator Mike Gallagher.

Participants in the race must
arrive at the Courthouse on
Main Street in Lexington by
8:30 a.m. on Sunday morning to
register and pick up their con-
testant numbers. After some
brief instructions the runners
will proceed to negotiate a 15
mile course that will take them
through Lexington and
numerous country roads before
they end up running one lap
around Wilson Field. Jerry Dar-
rell will provide refreshments
at aid stations every three miles
of the course. The Lexington
Rescue Squad will also drive
along the route to treat any
possible emergencies.

The only requirement for run-
ning in the race is a three dollar
entry fee with all proceeds go-
ing to the Multiple Sclerosis
fund. Last year the event
garnered $100 for the local MS
chapter. Gallagher indicated
that it is every hope and inten-
tion of the RtP Road Race
workers to raise more money

this year. As a bonus to anyone
participating in the race, t-
shirts commemorating the
event will be given to the en-
trants.

Last year marked the first
time that such an event was
held in this area and at the time,
community leaders expressed
the hope that it would become a
mainstay in charity efforts. In-
deed, the race attracted a lot of
attention and has helped to
establish a more direct link bet-
ween the local community and
Washington and Lee. It is the
opinion of some that the RtP
Road Race will be here to stay
and grow in popularity if this
year’s field is a respectable one,
both in size and quality.

Even though the final number
of entrants will not be determin-
ed until Sunday morning, there
are some early indications that
this year’s race will be a highly
competitive one. Brian Adams,
a second place finisher, is runn-
ing again as are noted long-
distance runners Bob Bates and
Jack Coffey. There are also a
number of unknowns who are
recognized as distance runners.
Also expected to participate is
George Cunningham of the Lex-
ington Postal Service, who last
year wowed the spectators with
his ironman performance
despite his advanced age. Un-

Rank-tam Poon Stirs Controversy

Pub. Board

Advertisers
Compensated

by Randy Smith

Student opinion proved to be
the decisive factor in Monday’s
Publications Board decision not
to remove J. Michael Gallagher
as editor of the Ring-tum Phi.

An estimated 150 students and
faculty attended the Pub. Board
meeting called to consider the
removal of Gallagher because
of his role in the publication of
last week’s Rank-tam Poon —
the first joke issue of the
Washington and Lee University
student newspaper in several
years.

Jeff Bird, last year’s business
manager of theCalyx and a cur
rent member of the Pub. Board,
introduced the motion to
dismiss Gallagher from the
editorship of the Ringtum Phi.
Parker Potter, the current
editor of Ariel and_ the
designated entertainment
editor of next year’s
newspaper, seconded the mo-
tion.

But after almost 45 minutes of
questions and comments from
the students attending the
meeting, Bird withdrew his mo-
tion saying, ‘‘After what has
been said here (by students sup-
porting Gallagher), I cannot in
good conscience keep my mo-
tion on the floor.”’

The Board subsequently
voted 5-1-2 that the dismissal
motion be withdrawn.

Bird had originally initiated
the Publications Board’s verbal
investigation of ‘Whether Mike
was responsible or irresponsi-
ble for the publication”’ of last
week’s joke issue.

Bird led the discussion by
saying that he was ‘‘disgusted”
with the content of the Rank-
tam Poon. He added that he was
‘‘embarrassed’’ by the
newspaper and said that the
issue indicated ‘negligence and
indifference’ on Gallagher's
part toward his responsibilities
as editor.

“My own opinion (of the
Rank-tam Poon can be summ-
ed up by your editoral.
Michael,”’ Bird said. The two-
word editorial read: ‘Screw
you.’

Defending his editorial in the
joke issue, Gallagher said,
‘That's what the students felt I
had been saying all year long.”

“I don't think the Rank-tam
Poon was irresponsible; it was

student funded newspaper from
circulation: ‘‘1, the University
collects a mandatory activity
fee from every student, partly
on behalf of theRing-tum Phi; 2,
the Ring-tum Phi is mailed
under a permit sponsored and
endorsed by the University.”

Keefe said the administration
had “removed the newspapers
from circulation permanently,”
but declined the words ‘‘con-
fiscate’’ or ‘‘seize’’.

The University statement us-
ed the term ‘‘disallow further
distribution’’ to describe its ac-
tion. ‘“‘There was no thought
given to rounding up copies that
had been distributed (as ‘“‘con-
fiscation’’ implies),’’ the state-
ment read.

900 copies still missing

The administration did not,
however, take responsibility for
the 600-1,200 copies of the
newspaper estimated to be
missing.

The estimates, which had
been released to the national
press, were determined by
Ring-tum Phi editor J. Michael
Gallagher who placed at least
part of the responsibility on

 

Papers Removed

members of his own staff.

“IT was told that Gray Col-
eman (entertainment editor
and next year’s Ring-tum Phi
editor-in-chief) went
around gathering up Rank-tam
Poons from the Student Center
Friday,” Gallagher said. ‘‘And
that Coleman was
apologizing to people for the
paper, even though he had not
only known some of the contents
of the paper, but had con-
tributed to it,” he added.

“Goss is in charge of circula-
tion and distribution and we
know that at least 900 papers
were never delivered,’
Gallagher said. He listed four
distribution points as the basis
for his figures: 250 papers to the
Alumni House, 250 to the Ring-
tum Phi office, 300 to the
library, and 100 to the law
school.

Gallagher admitted that he

had not confronted Coleman}

before releasing his statements
to the press.

The Publications Board has
appointed a committee to in-
vestigate the disappearance of
the still missing newspapers.

 

 

Fire Wrecks
Student’s Room

A fire of unknown origin
blackened a student’s room on
the third floor of Davis dor-
mitory Wednesday afternoon.

Paul Harris, the occupant,
said that he was not in the room
at the time. Harris said he was
in the computer room at the
time of the fire.

‘*Most of my desk was burned
up,’’ he said of the damage, and
he also lost his stereo, rug,
clothes and books.

The fire ‘‘filled the hall with
smoke,” but the Lexington fire
department was on the scene in
time to spare extensive
damage.

Harris is sleeping with a
friend. The University is still in-
vestigating the cause of the
blaze.

ODK Elects New Officers

At a recent meeting _ of
Omicron Delta Kappa, the na-
tional leadership honorary
fraternity founded at W&L in
1914, elections were held for the
1978-79 officers. After a secret
ballot, Matt Calvert and George
Ballantyne were elected presi-
dent and vice-president, respec-
tively. Calvert, a second-year
law student at W&L, has been
active in the Alpha Circle of
ODK since his tapping as an
undergraduate here - an almost
unprecedented record of long
service. Ballantyne, a rising
senior, was one of five members
in his class to be chosen for
membership in ODK this
January.

This year’s student members
of ODK, led by outgoing presi-
dent John Bruch, have taken
great steps toward making the
organization more than a one-
time honor. Special emphasis in
the meetings has gone toward
discussion of the relations bet-
ween the law~ and
undergraduate schools. Many
actions, from better news
dissemination to the suggestion
of a “Big Three Candidates’
Night”’ at Lewis Hall as well as
at Lee Chapel, have already
been taken.

Even so, ODK intends to

Mrs. Martin was president of
the statewide garden society in
1962-64 and chairman of its

The Executive Committee ap-
proved a request of $100 for the

the surrounding girls colleges
had let out for the summer.

Chapin concert set

(continued from page 1)
of ‘‘Spring’s Weekend,” in
which Pavillion parties, frater-
nity combos, and the junior
class grain party all merged for
one last blow-out before the
women’s colleges let out for the
summer.

The junior class has schedul-
ed its grain party for this Satur-
day afternoon after the N.C.
State lacrosse game. According
to both Bill Tucker (SAB Chair-
man) and Pete Williams (junior
class president) there had been
an attempt to converge the con-
cert and the class party on the
same weekend. Unfortunately,
problems involving the booking
of the concert resulted in a stall
in the SAB; in the intervening
time, the junior class officers

set the date for their party, and
found it impossible to roll back
the date, after learning of
Chapin’s arrival on May 11.

As a result, the  social-
entertainment scene for the spr-
ing continues in its fragmented
state. The grain party on April
29 will no doubt benefit from
lacrosse crowds that afternoon.
But the Chapin concert still
hangs precariously at the start
of a very empty weekend. The
SAB, still reeling from the du-
Pont Hall ban on movies in their
auditorium, continues to make
the best of the situation in the
cramped quarters of Room 114
in the Student Center. While
discussing this and other pro-
blems, the Board is still con-
sidering some sort of activity

The undergraduates on the

night to decide what graduating
senior shall receive the Gilliam

Nominations should be turned

The Gilliam Award was
created in 1963 in honor of Dean
Frank J. Gilliam, who retired in
1963, after many years as
Washington and Lee’s Dean of
Admissions and Dean of
Students. The award is given
solely on the basis of service,
rather than in consideration of
need.

There will be discussion next
week on the Spring E.C. party.

pression of involvement. Last
Monday night, $700 was obtain-
ed from the EC to hold any sort
of joint party between the
schools that ODK specified. At
the Tuesday night ODK
meeting, plans were finalized
for a party which will take place
on May 5, from 4 til 7 pm. While
the location of the affair is still
under consideration, most
members of the society have ex-
pressed a preference for the
field outside Lewis Hall, to get
optimum attendance from the
graduate students.

In addition, the plans for the
party include some sort of
entertainment. A _ suggestion
was made that a local bluegrass
band be contracted, or that
taped music provided by
undergrads be obtained. But in
any event, the center of the par-
ty will be beer -and lots of it. Ap-
proximately $500 will be spent
to obtain some 15 kegs of beer,
with cups, ice; and so forth.

Harry Chapin

 

 

Singer and Storyteller

by M. Gray Coleman

“‘Chapin concert...Pure
delight. Chapin earns full
marks as a performer, song
writer, singer...The audience
wouldn’t let him leave. Stan-
ding ovation...Cheering.
Remember W.O.L.D. ‘‘Cats In
the Cradle,” ‘Circle’? All
popular songs that touched the
people’s consciousness. Chapin
creations. That seems to be
what Harry Chapin wants to do;
to make people see their world
and fellow man with compas-
sion and empathy. A modern
mixture of Pied Piper and Pete
Seeger.”’

So wrote just one reviewer
about an entertainer who has
taken the industry by storm ina
very short time - Harry Chapin.
Few people who devote their
lives to both entertainment and
to public service have been as
successful on both fronts. In the
last two years alone, Chapin has
raised close to a million dollars
for various charities through
hundreds of benefit concerts. As
an artist, he has earned a gold
album, a gold single, an Oscar
nomination, two Grammy
nominations, and a 1976 Rocky
award in recognition of his
public service activities.

Harry Chapin was_ born
December 7, 1942, in Greenwich
Village in New York City.
Harry and his three brothers all
gravitated towards music, in-
fluenced by their father who
was a drummer with the Tom-
my Dorsey and Woody Herman
bands.

Harry worked in various ends
of the entertainment business -
forming an act with his brothers
for a time, then working with
film and documentary. One of
these documentaries, Legen-
dary Champions, brought him
his Academy Award nomina-
tion in 1969. page 2- Chapin
feature

Just before he got into film-
making Harry applied for a taxi
driver’s license, and was
prepared to do that to make
ends meet. The song “Taxi,”’
from his first mature album,
Heads and Tales, became a
worldwide hit in 1972.

More hits soon followed from
the ‘‘storyteller.”’ In 1974 ‘‘Cat’s
In The Cradle,” from the album
Verities and Balderdash,
became a hit, propelling both
the single and the album to gold
status.

Chapin’s rigorous performing
schedule keeps him busy

Ariel Returns With
2nd Issue In May

According to Parker Potter,
Editor of this year’s Ariel, the
second issue of the magazine
has already been sent to the
printer, and will be available
for distribution sometime in
mid-May.

This new Ariel will be 12
pages larger than the last in-
stallment. The emphasis here is
on variety with abunndance —
for example, there are to be
four short stories, and the styles
of the various poems and stories
will embrace everything from
anti-fiction to a Christian
allegory. Participation by the
student body has indeed picked
up; well over a_ dozen
manuscripts were received
quite recently.

Unfortunately for his legions
of fans, there will be no work
present from the pen of the im-
famous Angus I, N. Herbert,
who penned the ‘‘Red Square
Drinking Song’ of recent
memory. One can only wonder
what would have happened, had
Mr. Herbert turned his atten-
tion to such localities as
Washington Hall or Doremus
Gymnasium.

Chris Volk will again be sup-
plying the photography for this
issue. And, continuing a good
feature of the last Ariel, Potter
will be integrating the photos
with his verbal works according
to theme.

When asked about this most
recent production, Potter com-
mented: ‘In comparing my two

issues, while the last Ariel could

be called ‘classical’ — well-
defined, orthodox literature
types of generally short

length— the attempt with this
one was to be more ina ‘roman-
tic’ vein. The overall structure
of the periodical is designed to
include as many _ different
(often experimental) stories
and poems as possible. The
pages will be literally bursting
with material, rather than the
finely chiseled, one poem-one
page format of last January.”
Potter is indeed to be com-
mended for his success with a

betwee; 200 and 250 nights a
year. And in August, 1977, he
released his most recent album,
Dance Band on the Titanic,
which he considers to be his
finest to date. All eleven songs
are stories in the inimitable
Chapin mold, bound together by
the title song. That tune’s con-
notations are clear: Chapin
sees the entertainment industry
in the same light as the band on
that famous luxury liner, play-
ing music to divert attention
from the iceberg.

The current lineup of the
Harry Chapin band is: Steve
Chapin, piano and vocals; John
Wallace, bass and vocals; Doug
Walker, lead guitar and vocals;
Kim Scholes, cello; and Howard
Fields, drums.

The UCC and Student Music

the Student Center at 7:30 p.m.
Throughout the year, atten-
dance at these meetings has
fallen off drastically, and the
remaining members of the SMU
hope to revitalize the organiza-
tion. Though it serves as a con-
sultant to the UCC, suggesting
acts for the Cockpit, the Student

established to give students in-

chance to play together. In the
past several months, the SMU
has strayed from its original
purpose, but the remaining
members hope to return to that
principle this spring. All in-

Golfers capture

ODAC title

by Jim Ingham

Behind the playing of Jerry
Maatman and Dave Leunig, the
Washington and Lee golf team
captured the ODAC crown on
Monday. The Generals, under
ODAC Coach of the Year Buck
Leslie, still have five matches
to play, beginning with a con-
test on Friday against Roanoke
College at Roanoke.

The 36 hole ODAC tourna-
ment, played at the Staunton
Country Club, left the Generals
with a 628 total for their top four
players. Maatman had a two
round total of 151 to take first
place honors while Leunig shot
a 157 to come in third overall.
Bo Moorhead was in a four way
tie for sixth place at 160. Along
with Leslie receiving Coach of
the Year honors was Maatman,
who earned ODAC Player of the
Year.

On Monday and Tuesday last
week, in the William and Mary
Classic, the Generals placed
seventh in a field of 15. Leslie
said that this performance
“wasn’t too bad,’’ considering
exam week and spring break
meant an almost two week

layoff. Following the W&M
Classic, the team played a
match against Longwood Col-
lege, and won handily behind
the play of Maatman, who shot
a 68.

Leslie feels that the team is
“playing well right now.’’ He
stated that the long winter hurt
the team, and that only now is it
really starting to come around.
Leslie said that “‘if we continue
to play this well we will pro-
bably go to the Nationals.’’ He
went on to say that they would
not have a definite answer on
the post season play question
until the first or second week in
May.

The ODAC tournament is held
in the middle of the Generals’
schedule because a number of
the ODAC schools let out long
before W&L does. The away
match against Roanoke on Fri-
day is followed by a home
match with Bridgewater on
Monday. The Generals will then
have a match against Randolph
Macon and Bridgewater at
Randolph-Macon on Wednesday
before returning home on next

_ Friday for the regular season

finale against Roanoke.

Tennis team ODAC

by Mike Farrand

Washington and Lee’s varsity
tennis team became ODAC
champions over the weekend
with impressive wins over
seven other of Virginia’s Divi-
sion III schools. Playing on
home courts Friday and Satur-
day, the Generals stroked their
way to a score of 72 and the
ODAC crown. Emory and
Henry placed second with a dis-
tant 54 while the other colleges
fell in line as follows: Hampden
Sydney 48, Randolph-Macon 44,
Bridgwater 40, Lynchburg 29,
Eastern Mennonite 23, and
Roanoke 14.

In the finals of that event
W&L swept all nine flights with
singles victories by Ben Johns
over Vince Thomas of
Hampden-Sydney 6-2, 5-7, 6-1,
Stewart Jackson over Robert
Anderson of Emory and Henry
6-0, 6-1, Doug Gaker over Ben
Cart of H-S 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, David
Constine over John Milleson of
Bridgewater 6-0, 6-0, and Pat
Norris over Steve Young of
Bridgewater 6-2, 4-6, 6-1.

In Blacksburg, on April 18,
the Generals fell to Virginia
Tech 7-2; Davis winning 6-2, 7-6
and Jackson winning 6-4, 7-6. On

Lacrosse team beats N.C. State

in sudden death overtime

In a sudden death overtime
game, the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team beat North
Carolina State 13-12 Wednesday
afternoon. Jay Foster scored
the deciding goal 57 seconds in-
to the overtime period as the
eighth ranked Generals downed
the eleventh ranked Wolfpack.
The General’s next game is at
2:00 PM tommorrow against
Washington College on Wilson
Field.

Behind at one time by the
score of 10-6, the lacrosse team
came back and tied it at 10 all.
They then traded goals to make
the score 12-12, setting the stage
for Foster’s game winning shot.

Ths statistics of the game
showed a very even contest.
Both teams were penalized
seven times for six minutes
each, and both w were three for
seven in extra man goals. W&L
picked up 60 ground balls to N.
C. States 59, while N. C State
won 18 of 29 faceoffs. Charlie
Brown had 14 saves, and
Wolfpack goalie Bob Flintoff
had 18.

Head Coach Jack Emmer
was very pleased with the ef-

that the teamcould come back
after being behind by scores of

had beaten the University of
Virginia earlier in the season by
the score of 24-19.

UVa Stuns Generals

by Sandy Bishop

Over the last five years, the
clash with the University of
Virginia had become money in
the bank for W&L’s lacrosse
squad. But the Generals were
left with only memories of that
dominance following last Satur-
day’s affair.

Virginia, dominating every
facet of the game, controlled
the tempo of the contest and ex-

Court Situation Explained

by Jim Ingham

The six tennis courts under
the bridge going to Wilson Field
are being resurfaced and should
be ready for student use by the
end of next week, according to
Dick Miller, Assistant Director
of Athletics.

Miller explained that the sur-
face of these courts are not clay
but crushed stone, and that
every year more crushed stone

needs to be added to the surface
along with a binder material to
make the crushed stone stick.
He said that keeping the courts
in good condition takes ‘‘a lot of
work’”’ because they need to be
rolled and wetted everyday.
This work will continue even

after play has resumed on the
courts, Miller said. He also add-
ed that as soon as work is com-
pleted on the courts they will be

in the “best shape that- they
have been in for a long time.”’

 

The tennis courts by Wilson
Field are in use during D, E,
and F hours from Monday
through Thursday and from
1:30-3:00 five days a week. If a
match is being played, the
courts will be in use fromlap-
proximatel until approximately
5:00.

ploited weaknesses in the W&L
defense to whip the Generals
14-6 at the Lane High School
field before more than 6,000
fans.

W&L tallied first on Jay
Sindler’s low bouncer from the
restraining line at the 11:42
mark of the first quarter. The
Generals even held the lead
following the opening quarter,
2-1, but they were hardly in con-
trol of the situation. The
Generals, whose second goal
was tipped in by UVA
defenseman Kevin O’Shea,
were outshot 23-5 in that period,
and only a_ brilliant per-
formance by goalie Charlie
Brown prevented early
disaster. ‘‘Charlie kept us in the
game early,’’ said head coach
Jack Emmer.

Brown’s finest save of the
quarter occurred in the last
thirty seconds as he faced UVA
All-American Kris Snider one-
on-one. Snider, charging toward
the goal on a fast break, faked
high, then low, then shot high,
but Brown had it all the way.

The senior co-captain,
however, could not stop
Virginia alone, and the barrage

of second-quarter Cavalier .

shots produced four straight
goals and a 5-2 lead with 7:46
left in the half. Individual
dodges, an effective part of the
UVA game plan all afternoon,
produced three of those goals.
Virginia, unsuccessful in its
previous attempts to slow down
the play in games against
Hopkins and Maryland, was
now running and gunning.
Although Jeff Fritz narrowed
the gap to 5-3 three minutes
before halftime, the Generals
would never get closer to vic-
tory.

Things only got worse for
W&L in the second half. The
Generals were held scoreless

for the first 22 minutes of the
half while the Cavaliers
pumped in seven goals, mostly
on one-on-one dodges. Mark
Derbyshire’s goal with 7:45 left
made it 12-4, but no miracle
comeback was in the making.
Emmer even moved Brown to
midfield in an effort to get more
punch in his frustrated offense,
but it was to no avail.

The Cavaliers, in raising their
record to 5-3, outshot the
Generals, 61-29, and won 16
faceoffs to W&L’s seven. “They
were much more intense about
the situation,’ said Emmer. “‘It
was the most aggressive
Virginia team that we’ve seen.”’

UVA was not only aggressive
but also well prepared, due in
part to assistant coach Tom
Keigler’s knowledge of the
General players. “I think
Keigler knew our personnel
pretty well,” Emmer said.
Keigler, an All-American
defenseman here at W&L, is at-
tending graduate school as well
as assisting head coach Jim
Adams at Virginia.

The Generals can still deter-
mine their own fate concerning
the post-season tournament.
Now ranked eighth in the na-
tion, W&L faced a vastly im-
proved N.C. State team in
Raleigh Wednesday. The
Wolfpack, a 24-19 winner over
_UVA earlier in the season, is led
by Canadien Stan Cockerton.

On Saturday, the Generals
play host to Washington College
on Wilson Field at 2:00 p.m. The
following Wednesday has
Roanoke College invading
W&L. With the Roanoke team
comes their fans called the
‘‘Nasties,’’ who try to distract
the opponents defensemen and
goalie by yelling obscentities.
The ‘Nasties’ have caused
quite a stir in recent weeks, and —

Baseball team near
end of season

by Warren Crowdus

The Washington and Lee
baseball team came out with
only one win against four losses
last week, which included two
double-head contests.

The team split their
doubleheader against Eastern
Mennonite College by scores of
7-1 and 5-6. The Generals’ vic-
tory in the opener was due
largely to the seven hit pitching
performance of sophomore Vic
Shepard. The Generals led in
the early stages of the nightcap
but Eastern Mennonite took the
lead for good against reliever
By Steele.

The squad was swept by
Randolph-Macon on Saturday
by scores of 4-3 and 9-0. In the

first game the Randolph Macon
was able to score four runs
despite the solid four hit pit-
ching of Chip Childs. The se-
cond game saw Coach Joseph
Lyles experimenting by putting
third basemen Ted Hissey on
the mound. Against
Bridgewater on Monday, the
Generals lost in a slugfest by
the score of 13-7.

The Generals record now

stands at 3-13 overall and 2-8 in”

ODAC play. Already
elimenated from post season
play, the Generals will round
out their 1978 season with a
doubleheader at VMI on Sunday
and a single game at Liberty
Baptist on Saturday, May 6.

up a schedule that would have
given us a 32-0 record but he
didn’t want to. He’s made us
play these tough Division I
teams so that when we go to
Delaware in May for the na-
tionals we will be playing well.”’
The Generals now have a 7-9
record .against these Division I
teams, but have made even the
defeats quite memorable.
“Every one of the teams that
we have played this year has
had scholarship players,”’ notes
Cody, ‘‘and that’s what makes it
mean so much when we defeat
them, or just give them a good
fight. For instance at Georgia
Tech, even though we lost 5-4,
the match came right down to

the last set of the last match.
And Alabama is ranked in the
upper 15 in the country Division
I, but we took two matches from
them and had a couple of three
set matches. We are playing
well against these teams and
they respect us; every one of
them has asked us to come back
next year.”’

Cody is cautiously optimistic
about the Nationals, in May
Stating: ‘‘There_ will be
pressure on us because we are
the number one team, but, with
all of this tough playing we’ve
had, we should do well.”

The Generals will host
George Mason on Tuesday and
go to Roanoke for a match there
on Thursday.

Track And Field Team Beats
Lynchburg And Mennonite

by William B. Sherwin

The track Generals won again
on last Friday, defeating Lyn-
chburg and Eastern Mennonite
College 73-59'2-48'% at Wilson
Field. In conditions that are
best described as a mudbath,
the Generals pulled out a meet
that looked for awhile as if it
was really going to be tough.

Coach Norris Aldridge was
again delighted with his team’s
performance. “‘The team was
psyched for Lynchburg! They
are a really big rival for us, and
last year they won the outdoor
ODAC championship. right now
they hold the indoor title as
well.”

Apparently the key to the
team’s success this year is
depth. Only five first places
were recorded for the Generals,
but their were numerous se-
cond, third, and fourth places.

Captain Jack Norberg led the

gett

Generals in the victory, easily
capturing the 100 and 220, as
well as anchoring the 440 relay,
and the mile relay. Rich Byrd’s
performance _ particuliarly
pleased Aldridge. ‘Rich is just
coming off tondonitis and ran a
good time of 4.24.5 in the mile,”
he said. co-captain Norville
Scott did well, taking second
place in the 120 high hurdles,
the 440 hurtles, and fourth in the
triple jump. In the three mile
run, Al Weeks took second to a
“really tough competitor from
Eastern Mennonite,” according
to Aldridge.

Another second place was
recorded by R. J. Scaggs witha
time of 51.8. ‘Scaggs has done a
good job for us. He is just com-
ing from the basketball team,
and has only been with us about
a month,” said Aldridge. Once
again the mile relay team of
Bill Morris, R. J. Scaggs, Henry

Hairston, and Jack Norberg
won in their event, as did the 440
relay team of Jeff Brown, Cris
Leiser, Stew Atkinson, and Jack
Norberg. Karl Cheatham won
the triple jump with a leap of
44’2”’. W&L’s javelin team did
very well, with Jeff Slatcoff tak-
ing second Scott Swope taking
third, and Car] Kirkpatrick tak-
ing fourth. “Those fellows real-
ly came tho) through for us”’
said Aldridge.

The team’s next trial is in the
ODAC meet. “Bridgewater is
the team to beat,’ claims
Aldridge. ‘‘We could win it,
depending on the number of se-

cond and third places we win.”

Depth will determine who will
win the ODAC meet.

The conference championship
will be held at Emory and
Henry College at 11:00 this com-
ing Saturday.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Notes from the Sandbox

It can no longer be said that apathy permeates this
campus. The students showed Monday they were will-
ing to speak out for what they believe in and demand
what they have been told is theirs. This year’s student
body elections are another indication of an end to
apathy. It is about time.

Students should begin to realize just how many
rights they actually have. Since Washington and Lee
is a private institution, the students have exactly
ZERO rights legally. In practice though, we have the
rights the university so deems to give us and ac-
cording to the handbooks and catalogues floating
around campus, it would seem W&L students have a
self-run life and government.

Whoever devised the present system of student
government was a genius. The students have been put
in a little box to play as much and as hard as they
want until they start to throw dirt or come out of the
box before graduation. Then the administration
begins exerting pressure to stop misbehaving and get
back in the system of rules they have given the
students to play in.

It is when the university tries to step in the box and
change the rules it has given that the students must
rise up, as they did Monday, and claim what is theirs.
The university must be required to Keep its promises.
Precedents must not be set concerning students
rights and whenever the administration attempts to
put controls on student behavior, students must
demonstrate their views to prevent the university
from overstepping its self-made bounds.

kkk ke

The SAB has made a good choice for its Spring Con-
cert. Harry Chapin is a nice mellow performer who
will give the students their money’s worth. It is too hot
to dance in the Spring and with Chapin’s music, you
can just lay back and enjoy. It would be nice if the
SAB could arrange to hold it outside.

Finally, thanks to the students who supported me
Monday. I know many of you disagree with my
political views, but you showed a greater concern for
principle than personal bias. You made the year.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

Dear Editor,

We are law students whose
use of the gym was curtailed
during the undergraduate exam
and vacation weeks. We write to
offer a thank you to Athletic
Director McHenry, who went
out of his way to make facilities
available for those of us who
were still here.

Whether or not the pool and
other facilities remained open
was not an earthshaking mat-
ter. Now that there has been
enough interest shown in keep-
ing them open, several simple
solutions can be tried next year
to avoid the manpower and in-
surance problems that now ex-
ist.

A more serious problem, that
of attitudes, is not solved easily.
Our attempts to gain informa-
tion and to express our view-
points brought out two sharply
contrasting responses. One type
treated every question as a
challenge to authority, replying
only that, ‘‘this is the way it’s
done, that’s why...if you don’t
like it, too bad...it’s only for a
week or two...I don’t want to
talk about it any more...if you
can’t fit eight people into the
small pool, you aren’t using
your ingenuity.’’ So much for
‘ nlightened discussion.

Fortunately, Coach McHenry
doesn’t indulge in trite word
games. Instead, he took time to
listen, gave us valid reasons for
the current situation, and sug-
gested concrete ways to prevent
a recurrence next year.
Moreover, he donated his own
time to give us temporary
relief. For all these efforts we
thank him.

We are pleased, of course,
that Coach McHenry agreed
with us; we are far more pleas-
ed that he took the time to look
at it from our point of view. The
matter was one of irritation and
inconvenience, representative
of many minor problems
generated by the friction from
two timetables, two age groups,
and two social structures. It
also brought out two possible
ways of dealing with those pro-
blems.

: An open mind is not a solution
in itself. It may well be a prere-

quisite to any viable solution of
the ‘“‘gap’’ problems between
the law school and the
undergraduate school, student
body, and administration.

Sincerely.
Frank Terwilliger, Rick Muser,
Lynne Prymer, Fernando Man-
cias, Scott Tinnon, Charlie
Dorsey, Dave Heilberg

To the Editor of the Rank Tam
Poon,

Congratulations on another
fine display of student jour-
nalism talent through the
medium of a_ student
newspaper. I was very curious
to see just what contents a
‘Rank Tam Poon’’ would con-
tain in it. Once I had read the
front of the Ring-tum Phi, I
could make very little sense of
the Rank Tam Poon, even after
it was pointed out to me that I
was reading it upside down.

The trouble with the student
newspaper this year is that it
bas been almost impossible to
separate fact from nonfact in
the publication. Your
newspaper is so disordered as
to what is actually news and
what is actually sensationalism
(as in past issues) or what is ac-
tually glorified pornography
(as in the preceeding issue),
that it is very difficult to
distinguish that which is worth
reading from that which is not
worth reading.

One cannot say that all of the
RtP’s articles have been of no
value. Some of the topics that
the paper’s crusades have
covered are topics that have
needed discussion. My question
is this: have your actions as
editor been consistent with your
editorial positions?

Wherryou were actively cam-
paigning for the abolition of
closed meetings for all EC sub-
commitees a few months ago,
you made several accusations
to myself and the SAB. Permit
me to quote from your editorial
of January 19 with one slight
modification—that of
substituting your name and
position for mine. May I quote-
“Perhaps Mr. Gallagher has
forgotten just what his job is
supposed to be. The Editor of

the Ring-tum Phi _ should
guarantee that the student body
has been solicited adequately
for opinion. The Ring-tum Phi
should try to bring news to cam-
pus pleasing to all.”’

That is the responsibility as
out lined by your editorial. Are
you exempt from the demands
that you place on heads of other
committees? If you are ex-
empt, upon what basis do you
claim exemption? If you are
not exempt, why do you not
follow through on your demands
that you place on heads of other
committees? How much stu-
dent opinion was solicited
before tha decision was made to
print the Rank Tam Poon?

The Student Handbook says
that “Washington and Lee’s
weekly newspaper, the Ring-
tum Phi, is devoted to student
and faculty news and opinion.”’
One could ask if a proper
balance has been set between
devotion to opinion and repor-
ting of news. It further says that
“higher positions on the staff
come after the demonsration of
talent, diligence, and ability.’’ I
cannot question the diligence
that the paper has shown in pur-
suing some of its crusades, but I
certainly can question the
demonstration of talent and
ability as shown in the final
publication of those crusading
articles.

You seem to enjoy participa-
tion in battles brought about by
your paper. You won your bat-
tle with the Publications Board
on Monday when they did not
remove you as editor of the
paper. I must warn you not to
misinterpret this action as an
endorsement of your paper. I
think that it would have been
improper to dismiss you on the
basis of one issue, but I feel that
it is also improper that the Pub
Board did not issue some
declaration of disapproval of
the Rank-tam Poon being
issued as a_ student body
publication without first con-
sulti ng students as to whether
or not they approve of such a
publication.

Another battle you engaged in
was for the presidency of the
student body. One campaign

(continued from page 1}

a step toward improving the
product,’’ Gallagher said ex-
plaining the rational behind the
“Jampoon”’ newspaper. He said
the Rank-tam Poon had been an
attempt to “laugh at the pro-
blems we’ve had during the
year. If we can’t laugh at
ourselves, then that’s the real
problem.”

“This year has not been a
crusade to vent Mike
Gallagher’s frustrations,’’ said
Temp Webber, editor of this
year’s Calyx. Webber said the
joke issue was an attempt to
provide ‘‘something for
everybody; it was something
for people to sit back and en-
joy.”

Ryland Owen, chairman of
the Publications Board, added
his own opinion that the Rank-
tam Poon exhibited a “pure
lack of taste.”

Potter expressed concern
that his younger sister would
see the newspaper since his
parents had a subscription to
the Ring-tum Phi.

(To block mailing of the April
20 issue to subscribers, the ad-
ministration refused the Ring-
tum Phi’s postal permit.)

Potter also felt Gallagher had
overstepped his bounds as
newspaper editor by publishing
the ‘“‘lampoon’’ issue. Potter
argued that Gallagher was a
“newspaper editor, not the
editor of a ‘humor magazine’”’
(as the Rank-tam Poon describ-
ed itself).

‘We feel the Board is being
pressured by the administra-
tion,’”’ Webber charged.

Robert S. Keefe, director of

the University News Office and |

administration representative
on the Publications Board,.
denied that the administration
had taken a _ stand on
Gallagher’s removal.

(Keefe had issued a Universi-
ty statement on April 21
apologizing for the Rank-tam
Poon issue of the newspaper
calling it ‘‘distasteful,
disgusting, and a disgrace to
the University.”’ He added his
own “personal statement” in
the final paragraph which noted
Gallagher’s “recklessness and
utter lapse of taste and judge-
ment.”’)

Owen also said that no
pressure had been put on the
Board by the administration,
although he later said he had
received a note Friday from
Dean Lewis John urging that
the Pub. Board meet Monday to
discuss the Rank-tam Poon.

Gallagher said, however, that
in a telephone call he made to
Washington and Lee University
president R.E. R. Huntley
Saturday, the implication was

that the administration did seek .

his removal. ‘I said: ‘With the
publication of (Keefe’s April 21
letter), I feel the administration
has taken direct steps to affect
my removalas editor’.”’

“That is undoubtably true
Mr. Gallagher,” the editor said
Huntley replied.

Peter Goss, business
manager of the Ring-tum Phi,
said he had called Keefe Friday
morning to express his dismay
about the Rank-tam Poon, and
say that he thought the remain-
ing copies should be picked up.

As far as he knew, Keefe had
not acted on his request.

“I am responsible for the
paper’s circulation and the
finanical future of the Ring-tum
Phi,” explained Goss. The
business manager said he felt
the Rank-tam Poon would hurt
advertising revenue, although
he admitted that “‘at this point
in time, I have not had a chance
to hear any reactions’ from
advertisers.

“How can the advertisers
react to the issue if they haven’t
seen it?” Gallagher inter-
jected.

Goss said advertisers would
receive the: official apology of
the University and would be of-
fered compensation, but he
would not show them the issue.
“This is not the sort of issue
advertisers pay to advertise
in,” he said.

Dave McLean, last year’s
Ring-tum Phi business
manager, and other Pub. Board
members objected to Gallagher
“not having forewarned peo-
ple” that the April 20 publica-
tion would be a lampoon issue.
In that connection, Parker Pot-
ter said the advertisers had
been ‘‘defrauded.”’

However, it was not until the
student audience was allowed to
speak that anyone suggested
Goss should have warned the
advertisers, not Gallagher. It
was revealed during the au-
dience’s questioning that Goss
had known in advance that the
April 20 issue would be a lam-
poon, although he said he had
not known how far it would go.

It was also revealed during
the questioning period that

there had been a “large in-
crease” in the Ring-tum Phi’s
advertising this year over last,
although Goss attributed the in-
crease to the work of the
business staff rather than a
general improvement in the
quality of the paper itself.

Members of the audience at-
tending the meeting were allow-
ed to comment and ask ques-
tions after Bird’s motion to
remove Gallagher had been
seconded.

Gallagher’s supporters spoke
of the overall improvement of
the newspaper under his editor-
ship, and suggested that the
Pub. Board should not remove
Gallagher because of offensive
parts “‘of just one issue’’ of the
paper. Many students thought
the idea behind the lampoon
issue was good, even though
some found certain parts
“crude.”

The major concern of many
questioners was the location of
the missing copies of the
newspaper, believed to be
600-1,200 copies. Owen promised
to appoint a committee to in-
vestigate the situation.

For the most part, Gallagher
let the crowd speak in his
defense. ‘‘All I have to say is
take the Ring-tum Phi this year
and compare it to the past two
years, then throw me out,” the
editor said to the Pub. Board.
“Just because we put out one
joke issue, you want to hang
me,” he added.

But the student audience’s
turnout to Gallagher’s defense
had a visable impact on the
Board’s decision. One and one
