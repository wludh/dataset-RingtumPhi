Prepare yourself. The annual
mass pilgrimage of alumni to
our quiet little town of Lex-
ington is going to take place this
weekend — only this time in
duplicate.

Yes indeed, for every ex-
General motoring down ol’ 81 to
spend a couple of days
reminiscing grain parties and
road trips past, you can bet
your parking place there is an
ex-Keydet right behind him.
Due to an unadjustable schedul-
ing problem, W&L and VMI are
both having Homecoming this
weekend.
| According to Alumni Board

 

' Homecoming 1977:
Alumni, Parents, Dates To Flood Lexington

Chairman Ray Washburn, this
has happened before and will
most likely happen again in the
future. The problem is this:
VMI plays most of its football
games away due to increased
revenues from away games.
Therefore, the home game
schedule is limited, usually to
just enough games for
Homecoming and Parents’
Weekend. Since Washington
and Lee alumni also want a
football game on these two oc-
casions, there is always the
possibility of a conflict.
Washburn said the dates for
these two occasions are usually
set at the Alumni board’s May
meeting and at that time at-

tempts are made to cooperate
with VMI’s_ scheduling, but
“sometimes things just don’t
work out.”’

Unfortunately, that does not
help several hundred destitute
females whose dates have been
unsuccessful in finding them
shelter for the weekend. There
is not a hotel room available
within 30 miles of Lexington,
and many of these hapless
stranded will be forced to shut-
tle to and from their far-away
homes or (dare I suggest) tem-
porarily accommodate fraterni-
ty houses, dorm rooms, and
apartments.

Just how early does one need
to make a reservation in this

quaint little town of 8,000?
“Depending on the weekend,
about two or three months in ad-
vance,” says Holiday Inn
manager Ken Myrick.
‘However, for such occasions
as Homecoming and Parents’
Weekend, reservations are
often made a full year in ad-
vance.”

To help work out scheduling
conflicts with other surrounding
schools for the rest of the year,
the annual ‘Peaks of Otter’
Conference is going to take
place in Staunton this week so
that each school can present its
proposed calendar of events
and avoid conflicts with major
weekends such as W&L’s Fan-

cy Dress. SAB Co-chairman Bill
Tucker will be among four
students representing W&L.

Because of the huge numbers
of people in Lexington this
weekend, and to avoid the mass
hysteria which often results
(Alumni were once just like you
and me you know), the Lex-
ington Police have asked that
individuals exercise extreme
caution in driving in and around
the city.

Also, after checking with
various restaurants around
Lexington, I have found it
highly recommended that
reservations be made or that

you come very early, as there

are sure to be large crowds

EC Survey Shows
Honor Code Alive

by Jim Parker

W&L students value highly
the honor system, have trust in
their peers, and believe un-
trustworthy pupils should leave
the school. At least this is what
can generally be concluded
from a summer survey of W&L
students. Also, there is an over-
whelming support of the in-
dependent exam schedule both
by W&L undergraduates and
law school pupils.

The survey was a question-
naire sent to all 1706 W&L
students. 664, or 41 per cent
responded to it. The remaining
number (including this writer)
found the survey more useful
for playing waste can basket-
ball than as a contributing fac-
tor to the poll. However, as Jim
Underhill, E. C. president said,
the results would not have
varied much if a larger amount
had filled out the sheet. This ap-
pears quite likely, considering
the overwhelming agreement of
answers relating to the ques-
tions on the survey.

The poll consisted of four
basic questions, with sub ques-
tions for numbers 1 and 2. The
questions, as E.C. vice presi-
dent George Griffin stated,
were designed for ‘‘a general
overview ”’ of opinions of the stu-
dent body to garner a consensus
of how W&L pupils feel about
the honor system. For those
who don’t remember what was
asked or never looked at the
survey paper, these were the
questions:

la) Do you value highly the
concept of an honor system at
W&L?

ib) Do you think the students
generally value highly the con-
cept of an honor system at
W&L?

2a) Do you have a high level
of confidence in the trustwor-
thiness of other students at
W&L?

2b) Do you think the students
have a generally high level of
confidence in the trustwor-
thiness of other students at
W&L?

3) Do you think that a student
who cannot be trusted to be
honest should leave W&L?

4) So you think the use of an
independent exam schedule (as
distinguished from the more
traditional schedule where all
students in the same course
take the exam at the same time
undermines confidence in the
honor and trustworthiness of
the students?

The results, according to Jim
Underhill, came as no surprise.
The responses among the
undergraduates to the first five
questions were nearly all yes
votes (over 90 per cent, 99 per
cent on the first question) and
answers to the last question
were no in most cases (12 per
cent yes). Among the law
school, %4 of the students voted
yes on every question but the
last one, which over *4voted no
on. The only noticeable devia-
tion in the figures was a lack of
responses from the second and
third year law students.
Whereas the freshman through
senior undergraduates and
fourth year law school classes
averaged around 40 per cent
answering the survey, only 21
per cent of third year law
graduates and 29 per cent of se-
cond year law graduates did
likewise.

Since less law graduates fill-
ed out the survey, less law
students wrote remarks on the

Noise Violations;

Police Crack Down

by Neil Cote

Recent problems between the
town’s people and the frater-
nities have forced the Lexington
Police Department into strictly
enforcing an old local ordinance
concerning how much noise will
be tolerated at fraternity
houses during parties.

The ordinance, 15-31 and 15-32
in Section B of the town’s laws,
forbids Lexington residents and
students from creating noise so
it can be heard more than 50
feet away from its focal point
between the hours of 11 p.m. un-
til 7 a.m. Although the police
have been somewhat lenient
with the ordinance in past
years, numerous complaints
from local residents have com-
pelled the police to visit frater-

nities almost every night, and
ordering the members to tune
down the music.

“It used to be that the people
would tolerate some commotion
from the fraternities,’ said
Lexington Police Chief Kirby.
“But this year, the problem has
grown all out of proportion. We
don’t want to arrest or fine
anybody, but, unless we receive
some cooperation from the
fraternity houses, we will have
no choice.”’

Chief Kerby went on to say
that although he hopes it won’t
happen, the police department
reserves the right to fine of-
fenders up to $1000 and sentenc-
ing habitual offenders to one
year in prison. As of now, most-

NUMBER 4

Union To
Book
Cockpit

The Student Activities Board
suffered more than a $4,000 cut
in its proposed budget, and then
had an additional $2,200 taken
away from it and given to a
group called the Music Union at
Monday’s_three-and-one-half
hour Executive Committee
meeting.

The Music Union, formerly
the Progressive Music Club, in
cooperation with the SAB, will
take over one of the main func-
tions of the University Center
Committee: booking acts into
the Cockpit. The University
Center Committee had
previously been controlled
directly by the SAB. Music
Union advocates said they
believed the Union would have
better contacts with local musi-
cians and would be able to book
acts into the Cockpit for as lowa

‘price as possible. Previously,

the SAB had subscribed to a ser-
vice called ‘Coffee House,’
which sent in acts sporadically
and at a relatively high cost.
The SAB had originally asked
for $33,850. Included in that
budget was $2,200 for Cockpit
entertainment. The E.C. in its
preliminary budget is
allocating $29,550 to the SAB, in-
cluding the money they are giv-
ing to the Music Union. In addi-

Liberty Hall’s

past revealed

by Guy Brossy

While the Washington and
Lee campus was virtually dead
this summer, the site of the
Liberty Hall Academy was
bustling with students.

An archeological expedition
headed by assistant professor of
anthropology, Dr. John
McDaniel, spent eight weeks of
the summer trying to answer
some of the cultural questions
posed by the ruins of Liberty
Hall. For four years McDaniel

Traveler

From

Altruria

In my more rhapsodical
moments (when I’m not bang-
ing on this damn typewriter) I
think Washington and Lee
University has an ebullient,
creative power of diversity
quenched by the steeped tradi-
tions of socially phlegmatic
oligarchy. But most of the time
I think W&L is too damn con-
servative. Of course that’s only
one man’s opinion so, being the
good reporter I am, I went into
the streets, classrooms and
especially, bars to get the other
side of the story. I came out of
the bars with a black eye, but
here are the “grass root”
answers to my question: Is
W&L too conservative?

A: “Yes.’’ Unfortunately, I
made the mistake of asking this
question to a girl who would
have said yes to anything. For-
tunately, I had the presence of
mind to rephrase the question,
giving it a different ‘‘thrust,”
and making the answer far
more satisfactory in the long-
run.

A: “No, I think W&L is ac-
tually much too liberal,’’ said
an unidentified gentleman in a
white hood. ‘‘But we didn’t even
allow blacks in the school until
1970,” I protested. That’s when
I got a ‘“‘White Russian” thrown
in my face. Anda black eye.

A: “I don’t know.” The
answer which is the bane of ex-
istence to every noble pollster;
it was the answer given by
every female I happened to run
into. Also every female I
stumbled over. I must admire
these females though, they have
obviously studied the teachings
of Socrates; when you are ig-
norant, admit it. ‘‘For those
who know they don’t know are
wiser in some respects,”
Socrates would have said if he
hadn’t tried to get high on
hemlock, ‘‘at least they know
something.’’ Like what alchohol
does to your brain?

The results of my seren-
dipitous study go like this: One
person believed W&L is too
liberal, one person believed
W&L is too conservative, and
the other 498 either said “I don’t
know,” grunted or threw up.
One person said “Hubba, hub-
ba.’’ His answer was disregard-
ed. Conclusion? Don’t ask an
intelligent question on the
weekend.

has been testing five hypotheses
concerning the culture of the
Scotch-Irish at the time of the
Hall. Historically, the Scotch-
Irish settlers in this area have
been portrayed as crude fron-
tiersmen, unconcerned with
asthetics. They are thought.to
have been somewhat culturally
isolated. So far, the artifacts,
which include French gun
flints, British and Chinese
ceramics and several small
Spanish coins show that these
attitudes could be incorrect.

A group of close to 30 students
and adults participated in the
dig’s most successful season to
date. About a dozen of these
people came from schools such
as Clarion State in Penn-
sylvania, Sweet Briar, VMI,
and Tulane. Another group of
the same size was sent by Ear-
thwatch, an educational and
research program run by the
Center of Field Research in
Boston. The group of people
who directed the operation con-
sisted of former Washington
and Lee student and Liberty
Hall scholar, John Armstrong
1977, W&L seniors Kurt Russ,
Charlie Hall, Hank McKelway
and Mark Derbyshire. The staff
was rounded out by Parker Pot-
ter 1979, and Andy Holds 1980.

Last summer’s work centered
in three basic areas. The group
completed work left unfinished
last year on the spring house,
which they estimated to have
been in use up until about 1930.
The purpose in attempting to
date the spring house was to try
to determine whether or not it
was part of the original Liberty
Hall campus. So far, there has
been insufficient evidence to
establish a link between the
two. This Fall’s analysis of the
artifacts produced by the inten-

sive excavation of this structure
should yield an initial occupa-
tion date.

The expedition has also con-
tinued work inside the Hall in-
self. This work is part of a
desire to substantiate specula-
tion about the features of Liber-
ty Hall itself. As well, there was
an extensive search for small
artifacts, which could lend
some insight into the culture of
the Scotch-Irish, who built the
Hall in 1793.

The third area in which the
expedition dug was on the site of
a red brick farm house just
behind the baseball diamond.
Through the minutes of a Liber-
ty Hall Academy Trustee’s
meeting, the group found
evidence that the Academy
campus included not only Liber-
ty Hall, but also a steward’s
house, a rector’s house and a
number of other out buildings.
According to the minutes, the
brick for the rector’s house was
“burned (fired) on the site (of
the rector’s house)”. The
minutes also indicated that the
rector’s house was built in 1799.
Through survey of the site, the
expedition found a brick kiln,
which they dated at around
1800. Because of the close prox-
imity of the two dates, the group
believes that they have found
the original site of the rector’s
house.

On the same site, however,
the expedition found other foun-
dations, which are not part of
the red brick farm house. Due
to this subsequent find, the
group is not able to determine
for sure whether or not the red
brick farm house is indeed the
original rector’s house. Further
analysis this fall should indicate
the exact location of the rec-
tor’s house on the site.

Undergrads Included

Law School Plans Fun

by Galen Trussell

Washington and Lee’s Stu-
dent Bar Association (SBA)
asked for a 95 per cent return on
money paid by law students for
student tax, during the E.C.
budget hearings Monday.

Before this year the SBA had
been receiving only approx-
imately 80 per cent of the
money paid by law students for
the student tax. SBA president
Ray Leven felt that the request
for 95 per cent was justified
because the student tax is‘used
primarily for undergraduate
activities which don’t affect law
students.

Leven said that he didn’t
think law students were involv-
ed in 20 per cent of
undergraduate activities. He
explained that law students just
aren’t interested in attending
grain parties or beer busts. He
added that services such as the
Calyx and Ariel are focused
primarily on undergrads, but
had been partially financed
with law students’ student tax.

Leven said law students are
more interested in throwing
smaller parties with a more
‘“‘family’’ atmosphere than
undergrad parties. He explain-

eww rrr ner wreerres eruveve

ed that the slice of SBA money
that is budgeted towards the
SBA Social Committee is used
to throw two dances and to sub-
sidize smaller parties in in-
dividual law students’ apart-
ments.

Leven claimed that with the
increased money the SBA
Social Committee would throw
more parties and invite the
undergraduate community to
them. However, Leven said the
SBA Social Committee did not
yet have any specific plans for
this type party.

Originally the SBA asked for
a total budget of $11,760, out of
which $4,500 would be spent on
social activities. The E.C.,
however, arrived at a figure of
$10,060 for the total SBA budget.
The figure won’t. be final until
after the E.C. meeting next
Monday.

Another proposal Leven
brought up was that of allowing
the SBA access to funds before
the E. C. budget hearings.
Leven explained that law
students start school as early as
mid-August but have no funds
until October, when the E.C.
holds budget hearings.

 

Contact Begins With
Scotland Yard Director

by Jim Ingham

This year’s Contact program
gets under way next week on
Thursday night, when the Con-
tact Committee presents Sir
Robert Mark, Director of New
Scotland Yard in England. He is
the first of a projected list of six
to ten speakers. Admission for:
the 8:00 forum is free and the
program will be held in Lee
Chapel.

Sir Robert has a long and
distinguished record in the law
enforcement area. He served as
Commissioner of the London
Metropolitan Police from
1972-1977, and in this time, rid
the force of the corruption and
stealth that had _ thrived
undected by the press and
government. As commissioner,
Sir Robert went on to polish the
tarnished image the police
force had acquired from these
disclosures. After completing
this project, he retired. Sir
Robert has since come out of
retirement and is now Director
of the New Scotland Yard.

This year’s Contact Commit-
tee has altered its plans slightly
from years past. The bulk of the

program had usually been
scheduled in March, where as
many as four or five speakers
have been presented. This year,
however, the Committee’s pro-
gram will be more evenly
distributed throughout the year.
At least one more speaker will
be coming before Christmas
Vacation and in the months of
January and February there
will be an additional two or
three.

Another change in the pro-
gram will be the absence of a
particular theme. Billy
Webster, Co-chairman of the
committee along with Walter
Granruth, said, ‘‘The themes
weren’t being followed at all, so
we just discarded the entire
idea.”

Anyone who knows of a
speaker that they would like to
hear or could possibly get to
come to W&L should contact
either Webster or Granruth.
The Contact Committee’s list of
speakers is based solely on
choices that the students
themselves make, according to
Webster.

Tucker renovation

by Mark W. Danos

The reorganization of Tucker
Hall was completed this past
summer for the use by the
language department. Work
began according to Frank Par-
sons, assistant to the president,
“during the summer of 1976
when we started the library. It
roughly coincided with the
move from Tucker Hall to
Lewis Hall by the law school.”’

Tucker now houses the
language departments and
classrooms. Remodeling was
done, especially to the third
floor, to provide the kind of
classrooms the language
department needs. This was
done by subdividing large
classrooms. The language lab
will be moved to the third floor
of Tucker Hall, probably in the
large west classroom.

The remodeling was done by

fj-e enn emanate

W.W. Coffey and Sons, Inc., and
the schools’ Building and
Grounds. Robinson Hall is being
expanded at the present time
for the additional needs of the
Mathematic Department.

The first floor of Reid Hall,
the home of the Journalism
Department, presently is being

In keeping with all the tradi-
tions that make up Washington
and Lee, the sixteen frater-
nities, the Student Association
for Black Unity, and the Law
School laid the way for the up-
coming Homecoming Weekend |
by nominating their respective
“Queen”’ contestants. With a
few exceptions, this year’s girls
come from area colleges and
many are Art majors.

First of all, the nomination of
Beta Theta Pi is Vonna Forsyth,
a junior from Hollins. Vonna is
a French major from Reister-
town, Maryland. Junior Sandy
McDonald will escort Vonna on-
to the football field at halftime
on Saturday.

Sweet Briar senior Lucy Dar-
by will represent W&L’s newest
fraternity, Chi Psi. Peter Keefe,
cofounder and incumbent presi-
dent of Chi Psi, will be Miss
Darby’s escort.

Meanwhile at Delta Tau
Delta, house brother Coates
Simons of Chalestown, South
Carolina will present Hollins
junior Nancy Novak to the
Homecoming crowd. Nancy is a
studio art major from
Baltimore.

Saturday’s audience will be
treated to, among other things,
the ‘‘odd couple” of Kappa
Alpha. The swinging pair to
represent W&L’s lone Alpha
chapter are Randolph Macon’s
Allison Wilkinson from Con-
cord, North Carolina and Byron
Hale Delavan, Jr. from upper
New York state.

Representing Lambda Chi
Alpha will be Margaret Wren, a
freshman from Mary Baldwin.
Says Hunt Shuford, a
sophomore from Richmond of
his date, ‘‘she looks good in wet
hair.’’ Miss Wren, a resident of
Siler City, North Carolina,
however will probably have the
dry look Saturday afternoon.

The Law School will present

  

Betsy M. Callicott as its choice
for royal honors. Her escort,
Stan Brading of Lexington, is a
second year law student. Miss
Callicott is a veteran of five
weeks at Lewis Hall.

Houstonian senior George
“Scooter’’ Smith will team up
with Sweet Briar sophomore
Susan Smith, (contrary to any
rumors, the two are unrelated
and unmarried), to represent
Phi Delta Theta at the
Homecoming ceremonies. Miss
Smith hails from  Tulsa,.
Oklahoma.

Phi Gamma Delta, better
known as the FIJI’s, will match
up Charlie Brown and Randy
Mac’s Ellen Schall. Miss Schall,
a proficient swimmer from
Virginia Beach, is in her second
year at RMWC.

Phi Kappa Psi has nominated
Sharon Terry, an Economics
student at Randolph Macon.
Escorting the Phi Psi designate
from Charlotte, North Carolina,

Phi Delta Theta '
for the coveted throne will be
Andrew Fitzgerald from
Potomac, Maryland.

Wendy McClatchey, A Hollins
sophomore who has modeled for
‘‘Mademoiselle,’’ will take a
crack at the coronation for Phi
Kappa Sigma. Peter ‘‘Botts’’
Meem, from Bluefield, West
Virginia, will stand at the side
of the beautiful blonde lass.

Last year, an article in the
RtP, published soon after
Carter’s election victory,
reported that somehow the club
had “‘managed to find 33 cam-
pus Democrats willing to pay
dues.’’ Well, that was last year.
Now, the Washington and Lee
Young Democrats are gaining
more recognition. Lee Cave, a
junior and a philosophy major,
might just be the only YD presi-
dent to have taken over an ac-
tive organization.

RtP: Along with the rebirth of
your organization came many
snide remarks and snickering.
Now that this type of reaction
has subsided, how would you
assess your club’s standing,
after matriculation and the first
three weeks of classes?

Cave: You never do as well as
you like to do, but we have
made such remarkable pro-
gress over last year that I can-
not help but be happy.

RtP: When you talk of progress,
to what are you referring?
Cave: As far as membership is
concerned, we have had an in-
crease of over 135% since last
May. We've approximately
eighty due-paying members
with over twenty more students
who are soon to join. Also, we
possess a list of more than one

Pledging

down
significantly

by Chip Hughes

Fraternity rush, a longtime
tradition and major Fall social
activity at W&L, has ended —
and has ended with some very
surprising results. Even though
deferred rush is in progress, all
indications point to a noticeable
decline in the number of
freshmen pledging fraternities
this year as compared to years
past. At many houses, the drop
off ranges from 25 to 40 percent.
To better understand the causes
of this year’s ‘slow rush,” it is
necessary to examine closely
the attitudes of the three major
groups involved in rush: the
freshman class, the frater-
nities, and the IFC.

The freshman class, 97 per-
cent of which signed up for
rush, appear to share the relief
that most fraternities have con-
ducted a poorly organized,
unenthusiastic rush this year.
The freshmen questioned for
this article felt that at many
fraternities, members were
preoccupied with such things as
seeing old friends and meeting
girls and had neither the time
nor the desire to meet prospec-
tive pledges. Also, the freshman
class as a whole seems to be
more aware of the alternatives
to fraternity lite; consequently’
freshmen seem to be weighing
their decisions a little more
carefully. This may be due in
part to the IFC's presentation at
Natural Bridge. in which
freshmen were advised to take
their time and consider various
options in making fraternity
decisions. As one freshman in-
dependent succinctly put it, “I
went through rush and didn't
really meet a bunch'of guys |
liked that much, so I'm going in-
dependent."

Fraternity members,

Theatre plans
activities

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

Work is building up to its
usual fever-pitch at the Univer-
sity Theatre this fall. With
Oedipus Rex recently cast and
now well into rehearsals under
Prof. Lee Kahn, business atten-
tion turns to other matters.

UT officers elected

The theatre’s annual open
house and business meeting
was held recently. Among the
items up for discussion was the
election of new officers at UT.
All people who have worked in
any capacity for the theatre on
a show are eligible to vote, and
this year’s polling brought up
the following officers. Warren
Mowry, a senior, was elected
president for 1977-78, and is
basically in charge of all liason
matters between the theatre
and ‘‘the hill,” including the
E.C. Hunt Brown, a junior this
year, is the new House
Manager, in charge of handling
box office workers and ushers
for each show. And Barry Godia
will serve as this year’s Publici-
ty Director of the UT; all
publicity work, from flyers to
posters to radio blurbs is under
his call.

The Ring-Tum Phi con-
gratulates these individuals on
their accomplishment and
‘urges all students interested in
working in any area of the
theatre to contact one of these
three.

 

 

 

Open auditions
coming next week

 

In other business; prepara-
tions are now under way for
auditions for the second UT pro-
duction: the 18th century com-
edy Beaux Strategem. As
always, auditions are open to all
members of the student body,
and will be held next Thursday
and Friday, October 13-14, at 4-5
and 7-9 p.m. in the Troubadour
Theatre.

The comedy is a rolicking
portrait of that special
phenomenon of the 18th cen-
tury, the adventurer. An easy
comparison can be drawn bet-
ween the men in this play and
Fielding’s Tom Jones, both fill-
ed with riotous scenes of life in
the country houses and inns of
England.

Beaux Strategem, originally
produced in 1707, will be done
mainly in the style of the period,
with a lot of music and women.
A special note to W&L students
is that this play has a lot of nice,
distinctive, good-sized but not
overwhelmingly large male
roles. These parts would be
perfect for any student with an
interest in theatre and some
measure of talent, but without
the hours necessary to master a
lead role.

The show is to be directed by
Prof. Al Gordon, with
assistance from Stage Manager
John Jacobsen. The show is
slated to open in the
Troubadour on November 30,
right after Thanksgiving break.

Scripts may be picked up in the
Troubadour now, so sign one out
if you are interested.

Finally, Prof. Gordon has an-
nounced a program of ‘reading
theatre,’’ where plays are read
together and aloud by a small
group. This program is with
Sweet Briar College, and will
begin there on the evening of
October 18, Tuesday night, with
a group reading of a Shaw play.

Following readings will take
place on the W&L campus. For
futher details, please contact
Dr. Gordon in duPont Hall.
Those who are interested and
have forgotten to sign up,
please do so immediately with
Dr. Gordon.

NEXT WEEK: a special

preview of the soon-to-open
Oedipus Rex.....

 

Warren Mowry (left) and Ty York (right) show various
degrees of disgust and piety in these rehearsal shots from the
son-to-open UT production of OEDIPUS REX, to be previewed

“Lincoln” and “Silver Streak”’

 

—Photos by Bates

The Land of Oz

by Seth Oserin

It looks like our friends at the
State saved us from the
demoralizing experience of the
Bad News Bears in the
Astrodome. However, with a
delay of two days (taken up by

an extension of the run of.

“Smokey and the Bandit’’),
Lexington will. become.a
premiere, first run city. Yes
folks, for the first time since
“Godzilla Blows Lunch on
Tokyo,” Lexington will be a
world premiere city (along with

about a hundred others)! The
movie is “The Lincoln Con-
spiracy.”’ Although there are no
real big “‘names,”’ the movie
should, at the least, prove to be
very interesting. It’s a two week
run, and I’ll have a review on it

(as if anyone cares) next
week... Another flick worth see-
ing is over at the Lyric this
week. Gene Wilder, Richard
Pryor, and Jill Clayburgh (of
“1776” fame) star in “Silver

Streak,’ a comedy about
murder and a runaway train. It
is great. See it.

Did you see the ‘‘Trial of Lee
Harvey Oswald’’ on TV this
past weekend? If you didn’t,
you didn’t miss much. Based on
fact, it was a presentation of
what his trial probably would
have been like had Oswald not
been shot. The direction was
horrible, the acting mediocre,
and the script was despicable.
Too bad, it was a good idea....

Rumors have it that Twentieth-
Century Fox plans on blowing it

_Christmas....

 

€ye and Ear:
from the Bookstore

by Betty Munger

So now, in the interests of
equal rights let’s consider the
advantages of professors over
books. (Which, by the way, is
right generous of me, as a
bookperson! )

Probably the most important
thing which professors have
that books don’t have is ears.
Coming, as they do, in all sizes
and shapes, they listen. Pro-
fessors can rephrase, re-
explain and re-examine (no pun
intended) areas of material
which might be puzzling to the
rest of us. They can brighten
dull corners with occasional dry
wit and take time to spot the
gleam of understanding in our
eyes when ideas blossom.

Professors have other uses.
They have been known to rout
out a student when he hasn’t

 

shown up for an important ex-
am. They are very good when
chatting with anxious mothers
and fathers on Parents
Weekend about how well their
son is doing in class considering
how little time he spent study-
ing. The faculty provides a
vociferous cheering section at
lacrosse games—even I will add
a screech or two on these occa-
sions.

Professors are experts on the
alphabet—at least from A to F
and set great store by the
students being equally concern-
ed about these six letters. And
lastly, they are capable of smil-
ing happily and sharing a beer
in a purely social fashion—
which, is something no
publisher has yet been able to
build into a book.

 

 

all to make a TV series out of
“Star Wars’’ .... Mel Brooks has
a new movie, called “High Anx-
iety,”’ coming out during
Speaking about
“Star Wars,” the domestic box
office of our sci-fi Gone With the
Wind has already passed
through the $155 million mark,
and is still going strong.

Last week I predicted Andy
Gibb’s “I Just. Want to be Your

Everything’’ would be number
one for all pop singles for 1977.
Well, it is now evident that it
will have some huge competi-
tion. After debuting at number
50 on the Variety top 50 chart

19 before proceeding to number

enough, Ronnie McDowell’s

Gone,’’ debuted at number 9,
and is now standing at number

the Franz Bader Gallery in
Washington, D.C., and the
Ward-Nasse Gallery in New
York. He has also had a large
number of one-man, two-man
and group shows all over
Virginia and the south east.

His work has been seen in
Lexington before; he par-
ticipated in Virginia Military
Institute’s Mini-Festival of the
Arts in January 1976.

Gallery hours are 9-4
weekdays, no charge. So take a
learning break from McCor-
mick on Monday the 10th, and

Nickel & Diamond Theatre
New season announced

by M. Gray Coleman

The Nickel and Diamond
Theatre, Lexington’s communi-
ty showcase for theatrical
talent, has recently announced
its plans for the upcoming year,
according to Ginger McNeese,
Theatrical Director.

It will be a three-show season,
kicking off with Jean Kerr’s
comedy ‘‘Mary, Mary.”
Directed by Will Cantler, a re-
cent graduate of W&L, the
show will be in production in
early November. ‘Mary,
Mary’ is a light comedy about a
recently divorced husband and
wife, who are brought together
again due to the husband’s pre-
sent difficulty with the IRS. His
ex-wife, Mary, is only too glad
to become involved in the
brouhaha that develops, and on-
ward goes the plot to its natural,
funny end. As Ms. McNeese
puts it, ‘“Taxes, divorce, recon-
ciliation... the universality of
the show and problems it covers

Later plans for the other two
shows include a winter dinner-
theatre production of the 1930’s
style musical, ‘‘Dames at Sea,”’
and hopefully a_ full-scale
musical in the spring.

The theatre’s board of direc-
tors has been broadened, and
all are optimistic about the new
season, but certain problems
must be overcome soon, said
McNeese. One is the lack of any
permanent facility for per-
formances. The old Nickel and
Diamond, in the basement of
Old Main Mall, has been bought
and occupied by the W&L
theatre, for their expanding
Boiler Room facility. And
technical people are greatly
needed, especially those with
some expertise in lighting. if
any of this interests you, please
give Ginger McNeese a call at
463-7622 as soon as possible, as
rehearsals have begun already

HARRY RLEMS4 GALLERY

  

by Mark Mainwaring
Associate Music Director
WLUR-FM and Ward Boult

To begin this week’s
Mainstream, you'll find album
reviews on two comedy artist—
one up and coming and one
down and going. First, the bad
news.

On the Road
George Carlin
Little David LD 1075

George Carlin, as just about
everyone knows, was one of the
first youth-oriented, ‘‘anti-
establishment’? (remember
that term?) comedians to real-
ly hit the big time. His ap-
pearances on the old Flip
Wilson program and guest host
spots on the Tonight Show rare-
ly failed to leave the audience in
stitches. Even after several
years, in fact, his early albums
(AM/FM and Class Clown, for
example) seem nearly as
hilarious as they were the first
time around.

Unfortunately, Carlin’s new
album, On the Road, is further
evidence that ol: George isn’t
as funny as he used to be. The
routines on this LP range from
‘“‘Death and Dying’’ to ‘‘Kids,”’
and most of them just don’t
work. Most of the time, Carlin
seems to be simply rehashing
the same old stuff (or the same
type of stuff, anyway) to the
same old audience. To be sure,
On the Road does have its
moments; for example,
Carlin,s ideas on what to do
with the ‘‘Two Minute Warn-
ing’’ he says you get just before
death. If he wishes to remain

Ring-tum Phi, Oct. 6, 1977, Page 5

Musical Mainstream

successful, though, George
Carlin will have to move on to
some fresher material. We’ve
heard most of this before, and
it’s wearing a little thin.

Let’s Get Small
Steve Martin
Warner Brothers BSK 3090

Steve Martin, for any of you
who’ve spent the last six mon-
ths in a cave, is currently the
hottest comedian around. A
comparison here to George
Carlin is in some ways in-
evitable. Martin’s comedy, like
Carlin’s, is geared to a young
audience, and Martin owes
much of his popularity to recent
appearances on NBC’s Satur-
day Night and the Tonight Show
(where, like Carlin, he has serv-
ed as guest host).

The similarities end there,
however. Steve Martin’s new
album (his only LP so far),
Let’s Get Small, contains fresh,
new material. And even without
the visual cues and gags which
Martin frequently uses in his
stage act, the stuff on this
album is very funny. In addition
to such familiar routines as
“Excuse Me” and ‘“‘Let’s Get
Smail,”’ the LP contains ple.nty
of short, individual gems. Mar-
tin reveals his beginnings as a
comic (’’I started off at the bot-
tom. I was born a poor black
child.’’), the secret of his suc-
cess as a comedian (’’Before I
come out I put a slice of bologna
in each of my shoes. So when
I’m on stage, I feel funny.’’),
and finally, his solution to the
world population problem
("death penalty for parking
violations.’’). Let’s Get Small is

the best comedy album I’ve
heard in quite a while, and I
highly recommend it.

Cheap Trick
In Color
Epic PE34884

From the first line, ‘Hello
there, ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready to rock&’’ It isn’t
hard to ascertain what will
follow-fun lovin’ rock ’n roll.
Because let’s face it, Cheap
Trick is fun. In Color, their se-
cond effort, is ample proof.

Trick is made up of two pretty
faces, in the spirit of Peter
Frampton (lead vocalist and
rhythm guitarist Robin Zander
and bass player Tom Peterson)
and what looks like a modern
day Laurel and Hardy team
(drummer Ben E. Carlos and
lead guitarist Rick Nielson.)
Robin Zanders vocals fit Trick
to the T. (no pun intended) One
of the albums’ strong points is
that you just have to ‘“‘sing
along.” Admittedly, these are
some of the corniest lyrics
around, but on tunes like ‘‘Oh
Caroline’’ even the most
gourmet audiophile can’t help
but sing along with Zander;

In listening to tunes like
‘‘Downed’’‘‘Southern Girls’,
and ‘‘So Good To See You,’’ CT
is easily comparable to late
Beatles and perhaps The Who.
But they have that distinct
American Rock ‘n Roll flavor,
as well. Heavies include ‘Big
Eyes’’, “You're All Talk’’ and
‘Clock Strickes Ten.”’

In ‘Downed’: Zander sings
‘‘All you Walk is a Fine Line,”’

Sprunt receives endowed chair

An endowed professorship of
Bible in the Department of
Religion at Washington and Lee
University has been established
in memory of the late Fletcher
Otey Thomas by his children.

David Worth Sprunt, pro-
fessor of religion at W&L and
university chaplain, has been
named the first Fletcher Otey
Thomas Professor of Bible.

The announcements’ were
made today by Washington and
Lee President Robert E. R.
Huntley at W&L’s opening con-

vocation today, the first
university-wide assembly of the
new academic year.

Mr. Thomas was a prominent
religious, business and civic
leader in Bedford, Va., until his
death in 1948.

The new professorship in his
memory ‘‘perpetuates the
teaching of Bible as a point of
major emphasis in the religion
department”’ in recognition of
the donors’ interest in ‘superior
teaching of Christian theology,”’
Huntley said.

Mr. Thomas, a native of Bed-
ford County, lived all his life in
Bedford. He was a co-founder
and long-time director of Pied-
mont Label Co. in Bedford and
was superintendent of the Sun-
day school, a deacon, and an
elder in the Bedford
Presbyterian Church.

Dr. Sprunt, the newly named
Fletcher Otey Thomas Pro-
fessor of Bible, has taught at

department in 1956 and was
named university chaplain four
years later.

He is a B.A. graduate of
Davidson College and received
his bachelor’s and doctoral
degrees in theology from Union

Theological Seminary, Rich-
mond.
His fields of teaching

specialization include both the
Old and New Testaments. He is
a member of the National
Association of Biblical Instruc-
tors and the National Associa-
tion of College Chaplains.

He is chairman of the
Virginia State Advisory Com-
mittee to the United States Civil
Rights Commission, a member

of the board of visitors of
Eckerd College, and an officer
in several area mental-health,
retardation, and drug-abuse
service agencies.

He is married to the former
Elise Miller, and they have
three children.

The Fletcher Otey Thomas
Professorship in Bible is
Washington and Lee’s sixth en-
dowed professorship. The oldest
is the Society of the Cincinnati
professorship in mathematics,
established before the Civil War
when the Virginia branch of
that organization, of which
George Washington had been a
member, dissolved itself and
gave its entire treasury to the
college Washington had endow-
ed.

Generals Win

Doubleheader

by Chris Fay

By winning their fourth game
‘in five outings last Saturday
over Eastern Mennonite, the
Generals are sporting their best
record, 4-1, since the 1964 team
was 5-0. The J.V. team also won
its match against E.M.

The Generals’ perfect record
was blemished on September
28, when the University of Rich-
mond slipped by W&L by a
score of 2-1. In the Richmond
game the team did not play up
to par, but still only lost by one
goal. One player, when ques-
tioned about the game, simply
said, “It sucked.”

In the Mennonite game the
team was hampered by the wet
and slick field. Players who
tried sliding tackles often found
themselves six feet of target
and still sliding. The Generals
had a difficult time controlling
the offense as their passing
game suffered, because the ball
was too wet to handle.

The Generals’ lone goal came
midway through the second half
on a penalty kick. Kelly Ryan
took the shot about _ twenty
yards to the right of the Men-
nonite goal. Once again Dave
Williams scored by heading the
ball into the net. That was
William’s fifth goal of the year.

Washington and -Lee is still
unscored upon in their four wins

to date, defeating the opposition
9-0 in those four contests. Senior
goalie Mark Bennett, the
ODAC’s leading goalkeeper has
had a hand in each of those four
shutouts. The team and in-
dividual record for shutouts is
currently five, and that mark is
certainly in jeopardy this
season.

In the JV game Eastern Men-
nonite scored first in the second
half. However the Generals did
not give up, and responded with
three goals in twenty minutes.
This was their strongest offen-
sive drive this season.

The JV team lost their first
two games of the season. At
James Madison, the first game
of the season, the Generals
were simply outplayed by a
superior team as they lost 5-0.
In the second game against
Lynchburg College, the JV
team bottomed out early. The
Generals had control of the
game until the Lynchburg team
scored to tie it at 1-1. Lynchburg
put two more goals on the board
and won the game by a score of
3-1.

The Generals host ODAC foe
Roanoke College on Wilson
Field at 3:00 p.m. on Wednes-
day, and play at powerful
Elizabethtown College in Penn-
sylvania on Saturday.

Harriers Grab 4 Out
Of Top 5 Places

by Clem Carter

Washington and Lee’s Cross
Country Team raised its record
to six wins and one loss with a
strong performance in a
quadangular meet here Satur-
day.

The fact that the race was run
in a heavy rain and on a muddy
and slippery track did little to
slow the Generals down. Coach
Miller declared ‘‘We had a good
day, in the rain, mud, and all.”
The Washington and Lee team,
off to its best start since 1972,
dominated the meet with just 19
points. Roanoke College was a
distant second with 44 points.
Emory and Henry and Norfolk
State followed with 83 and 92
points respectively.

Freshman Chris Daniels led
the W&L harriers with first
place overall. He ran the 8000
meter course in 27 minutes and
57 seconds. Bob Bates finished
second overall with a time of 28
min. 25 sec. Allen Weeks and
Richard Bird both came in at 28
min. 37 sec. Weeks was award-
ed the fourth place, third for

W&L; Bird, the fourth man for
the Generals, was fifth place
overall. Brain Adams was
W&L’s fifth man, seventh man
in the meet. His time was 30
minutes even. Bill Welch and
Kevin Grimm placed sixth and
seventh for Washington and
Lee, and ninth and eleventh
overall to round out an excellent
performance by the Generals
top seven men.

Coach Miller feels the team is
steadily improving. The small
time spread between W&L’s
first and seventh man, Coach
Miller said, points to the fact
that on any given day any one of
them could lead the pack.

Washington and Lee travels
to Lynchburg Saturday to com-
pete in another four-way meet.
W&L will face Lynchburg Col-
lege, Virginia Wesleyan and
Norfolk State. Although Coach
Miller discounted any ad-
vantage Lynchburg might have
due to running on their home
course, he did say that they
would be the strongest team
W&L has faced since Davis and
Elkins.

 

Swimmers Undefeated
In League Play

by Jerry Harris

The W&L water polo team
traveled to Columbia, New
York over the weekend for an
important Middle Atlantic Con-
ference tournament. Enspired
by the balanced play of several
key performers, the Generals
came away with an unblemish-
ed record of three wins includ-
ing a stunning upset over John
Hopkins.

By virtue of their three vic-
tories, W&L remained as only
one of two teams in the con-
ference that are undefeated.
W&L will now host an Invita-
tional tournament beginning
this Friday that will provide
some stiff challenges to that ac-
complishment.

Two weeks from now the polo

team will travel to Penn State to
play five conference teams that
will decide whether or not they
will advance to the Eastern
regionals. All of this is a rather
startling development for a first
year team but one that might
have been expected considering
the past success of Coach
Stearns.

In Columbia the Generals
first game was an easy 26-12
conquest of Lehigh University
which was followed by a slightly
closer 12-9 verdict over Saint
Francis. However, it was the
final game, ‘‘the most impor-
tant by far,’’ that showed the
true potential of W&L.

Hopkins was undefeated com-
ing into the march and sporting
impressive credentials such as

the national swimming cham-
pionship from last year.
Ironically, it was the swimming
expertise that cost them the
game. Stearns pointed out that
Hopkins attempted to outswim
W&L which had a disadvantage
in numbers (8 to Hopkins’ 15)
but their strategy took away
from their acting. Coming from
behind on four different occa-
sions, W&L held on for an 11-10

victory.
Stearns pointed out that the
key to W&L’s_ success

throughout the tournament was
balanced scoring and consisten-
cy. Especially effective were
Keith Romich and Scott Duff
(each with 11 goals), Biff Mar-
tin (10 goals), Drew Pillsbury (8
goals) and Bob Newcomb (6
goals).

Football Teams Takes 0-4
Record Into Homecoming

A fumble proned offense and
a sporadic defense contributed
to W&L’s fourth loss in as many
outings last Saturday against
the ODAC defending champion,
Randolph-Macon, by a score of
21-13. The offense turned the
ball four times on four fumbles.
Washington and Lee won the
toss and struck first as quarter-
back Scott Swope connected on
a 23 yard pass to Senior split
end Bill Frear. The PAT was
good and the Generals had an

early 7-0 lead. Swope, a Junior,
making his first start in a varsi-
ty contest, had a good day com-
pleting 14 of 26 passes for 159
yards with two touchdowns.
Coach McHenry was quick to
point out that the offensive line
gave Swope excellent protec-
tion.

Randolph-Macon tied the
game up with 8:18 to play in the
first half when Fulback Mike

As expected, Hampton In-
stitute and U. Va. fought it out
for the 1977 Virginia Tennis
Championship, with the Pirates
winning 33-28. The Generals
finished tied for sixth with
Virginia Tech, behind ODU,
Richmond, and William &
Mary.

The second W&L doubles
team of sophomore Pat Norris
and blue-chip freshman Cody
Davis made it to the semifinals,
as did Stewart Jackson in the
number two singles spot. Last

year’s national Division III
doubles champions, Jackson
and Ben Johns, were eliminated
in the quarterfinals. Coach Den-
nis Bussard called this year’s
competition, ‘“‘So much stronger
than in 1976, with five very
strong teams as opposed to two
last fall.’’ The Generals finished
in third place last year in Lex-
ington.

The team is idle until October
14th when they will compete in
the James Madison University
Tournament in Harrisonburg.

tough time all day stopping
RMC on the ground.

With the score tied at 7-7 the
Generals fumbled the ball on
their 43 yard line. Five plays
later, the Yellowjackets scored
on a 12 yard run with 1:53 left on
the clock in the first half. RMC
converted the PAT and held the
lead for the rest of the game.

W&L had an excellent chance

to tie the game up in the second
half when the Generals had the
ball on the RMC two yard line.
Once again the Generals cough-
ed up the ball. The Yellow-
jackets took the ball and march-
ed 91 yards to the W&l seven.
The defense held the Yellow-
jackets on a fourth and two. The
offense took the field and gave
the ball up again on the first
play from scrimmage. RMC
recovered the ball on the 19
yard line. The Yellowjackets
took only five plays for their
final score of the day, as Mike
Woolfolk scampered five yards
into the endzone. The PAT was
good and the score stood 21-7.

Commenting on RMC’s final
score, Coach McHenry was
disappointed with the defense’s
performance. “I realize that it’s
tough for the defense to go right
back on to the field after they’ve
stopped a team after a long
drive,” said McHenry. “But
we've got to develop the mental
toughness to do just that if
we’re to have a_ successful
season.”

The Generals did not fold
completely and put together a
splendid 15 play 86 yard drive.
The drive was capped with a
spectacular catch by
sophomore splitend, Syd Farrar
on a ten yard pass from Swope
with 5:10 left to play. The
Generals tried for a two point
conversion, but failed. The final
score of the game, RMC-21,
W&L-13.

One of the bright spots in the
offense last Saturday was the
running of Sophomore Stewart
Atkinson. Atkinson, making his
‘77 debut after suffering an
ankle injury in preseason, rush-
ed for 102 yards. The General’s
week ground game is ex-
emplified by the fact that the

Angered KickerQuits Football Team

After suffering setback after
setback at the hands of op-
ponents the Football Generals
have been handed a setback of a
different nature—their
“Number One’’ placekicker for
the past two-and-one-half
seasons quit the team Tuesday.

In an interview with the Ring-
tum Phi Tuesday afternoon, ex-
General Dan Thompson said he
became frustrated after pro-
mises were repeatedly broken
and he was not given the op-
portunity to play. He feels situa-
tions have arisen during the
season for which his kicking
abilities were needed, but not
used.

Against Lock Haven State,
Thompson felt there were at
least three occasions in the first
half in which a kicker was need-
ed, but the coaches chose in-
stead to punt or go for the first
down. In the Davidson game,
even though it was obvious the
Generals were going to lose and
the coaches were substituting
heavily, Thompson was not
given the chance to make the
score more respectable or to
gain experience by kicking in a
game situation.

In the controversial Centre
game, Thompson believes the
coaches should have attempted
a field goal instead of punting.
“In the first half, when we were
inside their territory, Sid (Far-
rar) punted the ball into the
endzone, and the ball was’plac-
ed on the 20 yard line. If we had
attempted the field goal, we
possibly could have.scored, and
even if we didn’t, the ball still
would have ended up on the 20. I
think they made a bad decision
in electing to punt.”

Thompson believes that when
a team is in range for a field
goal, it should attempt one. He
said he believes McHenry
knows the value of a good kick-
ing game, but he doesn’t
understand why McHenry
doesn’t use a kicking attack in
his game strategy.

Thompson said he was called
upon to kick some field goals of
over 50 yards in high school
and, as recently as last week,
was putting them through the
goal posts from 55 yards out. He
said he had worked hard all
summer, lifting weights and
kicking almost everyday. He
reported to practice in August
in the best kicking shape and
with the best attitude and self-
confidence he had in his career.
His goals this year had been to
score a lot of points, make all-
conference kicker, and work
towards his long range goal of
becoming a pro.

He said McHenry had told
him on many occasions that he
would be used in the upcoming

games. It never happened. He
said he was only given ten
minutes a week on Friday to
work on his timing with the
team in scrimmage, and most
of this time was spent kicking
PAT’s. He said McHenry
repeatedly told him he was
pleased with his progress and
apologized for not playing him
more. Thompson does _ not
understand this due to the fact
that McHenry seldom had op-
portunities to see him perform
in practice or in games.
Thompson says he regrets not
having approached McHenry
earlier in the season to lodge his
complaints as an alternative to
quitting, but did not feel com-
fortable talking to the head

Alumni Return For
Preseason LaX Opener

W&L’s 1977 Homecoming
Weekend will conclude on Sun-
day, October 9th with the an-
nual Alumni Lacrosse Game
beginning at 12:00 noon on
Wilson Field. All are welcome;
there is no admission.

Head Coach Jack Emmer ex-
pects the best turnout of alumni
in recent memory as all Emmer
coached first-team _ All-
Americans since 1973 will
return to Lexington. That list
reads like a page out of the
Washington and Lee history
book — goalie Skeet Chadwick
(73, 74); defensemen Tom
Keigler (76, 77), Rob Lindsey
(75, 76), and Don Eavenson
(73); midfielders Skip Lichtfuss
(73, 74) and Ted Bauer (72, 73,
74); and attackman Sam
Englehart (71, 72, 73). In addi-
tion to those first . team selec-
tions, also returning to the site
of their glory days will be
second-team All-American at-
tackman Dave Warfield,

honorable mention All-
American Don Carroll, and Rob
Morgan, the school record
holder for goals in one season.

The 1978 W&L lacrosse
Generals will have their work
cut out for them against the
stars of the past. The present
team will be led by co-captains
Charlie Brown in goal and Jay
Sindler at midfield. Brown was
a third-team All-American last
season. Accompanying Brown
and Sindler will be attackmen
Jeff Fritz and John Black, both
50 plus point scorers of a year
ago, midfielders Charlie Stieff,
Mike Schuler, and Sandy
McDonald, and defenseman
Rod Roberts.

Jack Emmer expects a nip
and tuck affair on Sunday, as
most of the returning players
are still playing club ball. The
series currently stands at one
win each, the Alumni winning
17-12 last fall after losing 7-4 in
1975.

IKEVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Season Opens

It is upon us. The all important start of an integral
part of life here at Washington and Lee—the ‘rack
date’’ season. With the Homecoming festivities plann-
ed this weekend, the W&L gentlemen now have a
legitimate excuse to invite up that dainty “‘little
thing”’ he has had his eye on for a long time.

We have been blessed with unusual luck this year.
In the past, there were no questions asked, the girls
stayed in the local motels during the day, partied with
the guys in the afternoon and evening, and returned to
the hotel by midnight to get their essential 14 hours
beauty sleep. But this year, (heh, heh), the motels are
full due to W&L and VMI both having their homecom-
ings.

If you are a “‘veemee,’’ then you are out of luck.
Your girl will have to go back, and you will have a
lousy homecoming. But if you attend W&L, you have
something to fall back on; your charm, your per-
sonality, your room.

Unless you are a freshman. An upperclassman has
the maturity, the experience and knows what it takes
to come up with a quick, convincing excuse as to the
reason why his date doesn’t have a nice, quiet, private
motel room like ‘‘all the other respectable girls.’’ But
a freshman has not been here long enough to develop
the ultimate chivalrous alternative of, ‘‘Don’t worry,
you can stay in my room—I’ll sleep on the floor.”

Don’t worry freshmen, you will learn. It takes time
to develop your charm, personality, and overall
general appearance. It takes time to get used to the
girls up here. The equestrian majors, the home ec
majors, and the ‘“‘probable”’ kindergarten teachers
are a special breed of women, and many times plan A
or even plan B won’t work.

You also don’t know the absolute necessity of hav-
ing a successful “rack date.” It can add so much to
your character, personality, GPA and campus
prestige.

There is no finer feeling than on Sunday afternoon
after your weekend honey has gone back and you and
the guys are gathered in the hall discussing your first
“rack date.” In the ‘Tales of the Hall’ you find
yourself either bragging and boasting about your ex-
ploits, or feigning nobleness and a sense of honor,
knowing all the while that it is all BS.

But it is really fruitless for you to be told all this. It
all sounds very interesting, but you are probably pret-
ty skeptical about all of the above happening. Even
though there is a 95% chance that you considered
yourself a high school stud, after this weekend many
of you will feel like you have been put out to pasture.
Good luck! Experience is the best teacher, and after
this weekend you will be a W&L man one way or
another. :

A closing note to those of you have been set up with
“blind” dates by well-intentioned upperclassmen.
Your date has been described to you as either a nice
girl or a good girl. Sometimes this can be misleading,
especially if this is your first blind date. You can
never really be sure, but a 16th century poet has given
us perhaps the best criteria for judging the quality of
your date: ‘‘Nice Girls go out, go home, and go to bed;
good girls go out, go to bed, and go home.”’

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

Saturday, Oct. 1, 1977
Editor, Ring-tum Phi

Ther were some delightful
pictures of some young ladies in
the Phi last week just delightful
and why were they in there they
were there to remind us what
girls look like because we
hadn’t seen any since the last
weelend and we weren't destin-
ed to see any since the until the
upcoming weekend and why is
all this true because the nearest
female college students except
B.V.ers go to school thirty five
miles away with most young
ladies forty five miles away
now that makes sense doesn’t it
fourteen hundred young men
here who merely have to travel
forty five miles over wonderful
mountain roads to talk to a
young woman unless they want
to pay a dime every minute for
a long distance voice without a
face and why do we do this well
it’s all very logical back in 1749
some men founded a school for
their genedr of their species and
as we all know what’s good
enough for 1749 you know when
we were all British subjects is
good enough for 1977 and
whoever those commies were
who broke away from his ma-
jesty George III; well those
pinko fags should have been ex-
terminated anyway those 2,900
schools that have enrolled
females ought to be ashamed
thank goodness there are still
sixteen colleges around that
realize the importance of keep-
ing the less intelligent sex out of
higher education what mix the
seses to provide an environ-
ment that more. closely
resembles the “real world’
what blasphemy what sacrilege
who ever said college is suppos-
ed to prepare students for life
there is no such thing as a
woman who lives during the
week they only exist on
weekends because I’ve never
seen a girl during the week
what wearing sloppy clothes
like men impossible and
without makeup it couldn't be
so don’t tell me about girls I’ve
seen them they're all pretty and
they all wear nice skirts and
blouses or fancy slacks girls

don’t wear jeans and their hair
is always neatly combed that’s
what girls look like and they
don’t know anything about
politics philosophy biology
Spanish mathematics
psychology economics
chemistry music english or
anything like that they just go to
parties and say college is a lear-
ning experience well, that’s
what I’ve learned that all
makes sense to you doesn’t it
this is a very cosmopolitan
school after we eliminate the
less important fifty per cent of
the population yearh that
makes sense that makes sense
that makes sense well thanks
again for the pictures my
memory needed a refreshment i
had almost forgotten. Palmore

Clarke, ‘80.

Dear Mr. Editor,

It was with great.dismay that
I read your editorial of
September 29, concerning the
football team. For someone who
couldn’t hack it himself on the
W&L football field, you seem to
be quite an authority on the pro-
blems of the 1977 squad. If you
have come to expect a loser,
then I would say you are a loser
yourself. We have eight games
left this year with a good chance
for a winning season.

 

As for myself, I take a lot of
pride in playing for Washington
and Lee. Win or lose, we get
“dumped on’’ a lot because of
the winning teams around us. I
can safely say that the entire
team has a great deal of con-
fidence in our coaching staff.
They are under pressure each
week, trying to get us prepared
for a team that is usually bigger
and faster. Each game we win
is a tribute to them. You must
remember that it is the players
on the field who lose, not the
coaches. If anyone is to blame
for our poor performance to
date, we are. It could be said
that my opinion is not objective
enough because I am on the
team, but I hope you will print
this, as my sentiments are
shared by all of my teammates
and many other friends.

Maybe all of us should quit
and become feature writers for
the Ring-tum Phi like J.M.G!

There appeared to be a great

‘Murph
Reports”

A number of W&L students
have been victims of theft dur-
ing the first three weeks of
school.

Charles Murphy, University
Proctor, said that four or five
wallets have been reported lost
or stolen at Wilson Field. In ad-
dition, about six wallets have
disappeared from the freshmen
dorms. Murphy said that one
freshman reported losing or
having a wallet stolen with $160
in it. Also, a tapedeck was taken
from “The Corrall,” the park-
ing lot opposite the Phi Kappa
Sigma House.

There have been a number of
parking tickets written out.
Murphy said that this was
almost inevitable, for there are
just not enough parking places
around campus for students,
faculty and staff. There are 983
cars registered among the stu-
dent body alone.

jamin Britten. Spirituals and
traditional W&L songs, as well
as a medley from Rogers and
Hammerstein’s ‘‘Oklahoma,”’
are to be used in the concerts.
The trip to Mexico is planned
for April 8-16, between the
Winter and Spring semesters.
The trip’s itinerary includes
concerts in Mexico City and
Cuernavaca and vacationing in
Acapulco. Some of the funding
comes from sales of the record
“Songs Of W&L,’’ which can be
found in the campus record
shop. Additionally, they will
raise money by raffling off a
trip to Mexico City and
Ac

  

of weeks to replace the school’s
dated F30. This computer will
be temporarily located in the
basement of Tucker Hall. The
old Tucker library will be
restructured to become the per-
manent home of the computer
center. This work will be exten-
sive because of the reengineer-
ing required to the electrical,
vent and air-conditioning
systems. Upon completion and
move of the computer center to
the first floor, the basement will
be remodeled and will become
the future quarters of the
Psychology department.

Henry Ravenhorst, professor
and architect for the Tucker
Hall and most likely for future
work, will try to match the in-
terior design to the age of the
building. Parsons felt, ‘We will
try to also keep the open feeling
of the building, for example, in
the computer center. We will
try and take advantage of this
beautiful large room while at
the same time provide
separate..and secure spaces.’’

Future planning includes
making McCormack Library,
the future home of an expanded
Commerce School. Newcomb
Hall will then open up to take in
the History, Sociology and
Religion departments.

Music Course
In Winter

A music appreciation course
in bluegrass music will be of-
fered winter term for no credit.
The course will meet on a one
hour a week basis for the fu'l
twelve week term. It will in-
volve individual instruction (on
guitar and possibly banjo, fid-
dle, mandolin, dobro and bass)
and discussion of the history of
bluegrass music, as it has
evolved from ‘‘old time’’ until
now.

The course will be taught by
Burr Datz, who played with
local bluegrass musicians while
he was a student and who has
worked with various bluegrass
bands in New York for the past
two years. Datz has set forth
three major objectives for the
course. Students should develop
an appreciation for bluegrass,
learn to identify different musi-
cians by their styles, and learn
or further an ability to play a
bluegrass instrument. Em-
phasis in this last objective is
placed on reading tablature.
Each bluegrass instrument will
be covered separately, and the
individual styles of certain
musicians will be covered. One
textbook will be needed for the
course, ‘‘Bluegrass”’ by Bob Ar-
tis, and each interested student
will need two sixty minute tapes
(cassette) for the course. The
tapes will be used for class pur-
poses and may be kept by the
students.

All interested students should
contact Burr Datz in Evans Din-
ing Hall or sign up outside of Dr.
Stewart’s office in McCormick

coach. When asked if he had
confidence in the coaching
staff, Thompson refused to
comment except to say that he
agreed with the editorial in last
week'sRing-tum Phi (the
coaching staff for indecision
and its disorganization).

Thompson said when he
realized that he was beginning
to question the coaching deci-
sions and lose his respect for the
staff, coupled with the coaches
broken promises to him, he
decided that he no longer had a
legitimate right to stay on the
team. During his career,
Thompson has kicked 25 PAT’s
and 9 field goals. When con-
tacted late Tuesday night,
McHenry declined to comment
on the matter.

Rush

(continued from page 3)

however, share a greatly dif-
ferent viewpoint. Many
brothers questioned said they
felt that this year’s freshmen,
as a whole, are calmer, and

perhaps, more apathetic about
choosing fraternities than past
freshmen. Many of the more
‘“stereotyped”’ fraternities are
also finding it difficult to find
people who fit their images. As
one fraternity member sated,
quite bluntly, ‘‘We didn’t get
nearly the amount of cream-of-
the-crop guys in here that we
expected.”

Perhaps the most ignored, yet
most influential group which
has had a bearing upon rush
this year has been the IFC. Two
major actions taken by the
group this year appear to have
greatly affected rush: first, the
aforementioned admonition to
freshmen at orientation not to
make fraternity choices hur-
riedly appears to have influenc-
ed many to make more careful
considerations. Second, strict
rush rule enforecement has
prevented some houses from
practicing illegal rush tactics
which had previously brought in
pledges (i.e. — In past years,
some houses have _ plied
freshmen with liquor during
rush dates — a rule violation —
and then high-pressured these
freshmen into pledging). In any
case, this year’s IFC actions
have better prepared the
freshmen for rush and forced
fraternities to adhere to rush
rules.

Whatever the causes of this
year’s lackluster rush, several
conclusions may be drawn.
First, this year’s freshmen
were, aS a_ group, better
prepared to go through rush
than any class in_ recent
history ; second, fraternities are
having a difficult time finding
freshmen who conform to their
standards for membership; and
third, the IFC has made it
harder for fraternities to
employ dubious tactics in
building pledge classes. If this
trend repeats itself in years to
come, fraternities may have to
re-examine their ideals or suf-
fer smaller-than-usual pledge
classes. As for this year,
though, it appears that rush and
fraternity life are in a transi-
tional stage which may lead to
important re-evaluations in
many houses.

EC Votes On Budget Requests

tion the E.C. will give the SAB
$2,000 to buy new projector
equipment.

The SAB was not the only
organization to see its proposed
budget slashed from $7,500 to
$6,100, almost a 20 per cent cut.
It appears as though there is
sentiment on the E.C., however,
to give Contact some more
money. Contact needs more
money to put on a worthwhile
program, said senior E.C.
representative Mike Missal.
The problem is going to be find-
ing sources for that money.

One of the sources, as in-
dicated .by senior E.C.
representative Doug Perkins,
may be Ariel, the student
literary magazine. Perkins
commented that Ariel had only
been able to put out one issue
last year, and he thought that
was enough. As it was Ariel’s
budget was cut from a proposed
$1,200 to $950, more than a 20
percent cut. Peer, Perkins said
he would propose to cut Ariel’s
budget down to $475 next week.

The Ring-tum Phi’s budget
was given a preliminary cut of
$500, despite the fact that the
Phi asked for almost $1,000 less
than last year. It was the only
organization that asked for less
money this year than it got last
year. Business Manager Pete
Goss protested the cut of the
Phi’s budget from $3,000 to
$2,500., saying that he had
‘‘gone out on a limb’’ to propose
such a low budget. He said that
when he figured the budget he
had tried to be optimistic on
both the amount of advertising
he could get and on the cost of
getting out each issue.

Goss said he had figured on

167s. Main MARKET

We Give S&H Green Stamps
(We Welcome Student Charge Accounts)

(continued from page 1)

each issue costing $365 to put
out, although each issue could
cost as much as $425. In addi-
tion, he said the projected two
pages of advertisements could
be too high. Goss threatened to
return the Phi to its original
eight page format if he found
the cuts were intolerable.

Goss seemed to lose a lot of
support when he told the E.C.
that last year’s business
manager Dave McLean earned
approximately $490 and last
year’s editor, Robert D. Lutz,
earned about $450. E.C.
members were shocked at the
amount of money the Publica-
tions Board gave McLean and
Lutz for salaries. Jim
Underhill, E.C. president, said
he thought there was a fixed
salary of $150. Goss said the
business manager receives $200
plus 25 percent of the profits
made by the paper, while the
editor receives $150 plus 20 per-
cent of the profits.

Rick Goddard figured out that
that meant the Phi made $1,300
in profits last year, and re-
quested the E.C. take $1,300
from the Phi and give it to the
law school. Compromise
brought the figure down to $500.

The law school had $1,440
trimmed from its request, but
still got $2,500 more than it
received last year. The law
school requested $11,500 and is
tentatively scheduled to get
$10,060. They were indications
at the meeting, however, that
this figure may go up. Student
Bar Association President Ray
Leven was adamant that the
principle of funding the law
school be ‘“‘getting our fair
share.’’ He said the law school

was ‘“‘underfunded last year
because of the new building.”

Both he and Goddard said
they strongly believe that the
law school get back 95 percent
of the money it contributes to
the student fund. They also sug-
gested, because the law school
is in session more than three
weeks before the E.C. first
meets that all the money col-
lected at matriculation for stu-
dent activity fees be given
directly to the law school, and
then the E.C. could tax away
‘between 5 and 7 percent” of
the monies as soon as possible,
but declined to set a policy
stipulating that the law school
should get 95 percent of its
funds back directly.

The Calyx’s budget was only
cut by $200, from $9,200 to
$9,000. The Mock Convention
got its requested $300 for
operating expenses, although it
wanted more to avoid a $5 rise
in the student activity fee in
1980, which is sure to come now.

In addition, the E.C. ap-
propriated $2,000 for itself for
operating expenses, laid away
$3,600 for further E.C. funding
requests and put aside $1,540 for
the Student Body Reserve
Fund, a fund used for bailing
out organizations in financial
trouble.

In other action, the E.C.
elected Robert Sundberg to the
faculty E.C., Robert Atkinson
and John Strong to the Commit-
tee on Courses and Degrees,
Fred Brimberg to the Library
Advisory Committee and Mark
Bennett, Mark Derbyshire and
Derrick Swope to the Athletic
Committee.

 

Competition for

grants closing

The 1978-79 competition for
grants for graduate study
abroad offered under the
Mutual Educational Exchange
Program (Fulbright-Hays) and
by foreign governments,
universities and private donors
will close shortly. Only a few
more weeks remain in which
qualified graduate students
may apply for one of the 550
awards which are available to
53 countries.

Most of the grants offered
provide round-trip transporta-
tion, tuition and maintenance
for one academic year; a few
provide international travel on-
ly or a stipend intended as a
partial grant-in-aid.

Candidates must be U. S.
citizens at the time of applica-
tion, hold a bachelor’s degree or
its equivalent by the beginning
date of the grant, have
language ability commensurate
with the demands of the propos-
ed study projects, and good
health.

Honor
Survey

essay question which also ap-
peared on the form. (In general,
the question concerned what
improvements or changes could
be made to the honor system
itself or on the application and
enforcement of it). However,
some law students who respond-
ed felt there wasn’t enough
orientation to the honor system.
They never obtained the
benefits (what few there were)
of Natural Bridge, and only one
speaker was sent there last
year to discuss the honor
system according to Underhill.
Common replies of both the law
school and the university were
for stronger action by the E.C.
concerning honor violations
said Underhill and Griffin.

Some students answered that
W&L pupils must be trusted
completely or not at all. As
Underhill put it, the test of the
honor system is not the rules
themselves, but how the
students and the school obey it
and enforce it. It appears the
students are solidly behind the
honor system, at least in princi-
ple.

ly warnings have been given out

who, despite repeated warn-

house’s stereo system. His case
is now pending at the local cour-

Officer Marvin Hamilton add-

complaints have primarily been
directed at the fraternities
situated on East Nelson and

fraternities near Preston

share of violations.

“If necessary, we will arrest
the fraternity’s president or
social chairman because we
feel that he is most responsible
for his house’s_behavior,”’
Hamilton said. “‘All I can say is
that I hope the houses have
enough sense to respect the
local laws so we can avoid pro-
blems.”’

Although they haven’t taken
an issue on the stand as of yet,
the Inter-Fraternity Council
will probably start levying fines
to violators of the ordinance.
Last year, a fraternity was
placed on social probation for
making excessive noise and for

taking part in a bottle throwing
incident.

“I hope the fraternities will
take it upon themselves to obey
the local laws,’’ said Dean John,
when asked his views on the
situation. ‘Both last year and
this year, the local councilmen
have complained about loud
music coming from fraternities
at all hours of the night.”

Dean John also attributed the
recent problems as the result of
the weeknight parties many
houses have been holding dur-
ing Rush. “In the past, most
houses held loud parties on

weekends but the trend with
many fraternities seems to be
in holding parties on Wednes-
day nights. The local people
may be tolerant of weekend
noise but it is an entirely dif-
ferent situation, when houses

a.m. on a week night.”’

A number of fraternities com-
plain that the police have been
unreasonably strict in enforcing
the ordinance. Several houses
claimed that they were told to
turn off their stereo systems
during afternoon parties when
the rule is not in effect. Other
houses accused neighboring
fraternities of making the com-
plaints themselves as a means
of dirty rush.

ideologies and beliefs; but in-
stead of looking at this as a
weakness, a course for fac-
tionalism, we look at it as a sign
of strength.

RtP: Many wonder, what is the
ideology of the Young
Democrats?

Cave: Basically, the average
member of the W&L YD’s is,
like the average student at
W&L, conservative. Although, I
do not think the average YD is
nearly as conservative as is the
average College Republican.
We are far from being anything
but a moderate political
organization.

RtP: Could you outline some of
your basic plans or objectives
for the year.

Cave: The club plans to have a
fairly impressive speakers’ pro-
gram which should include
several Congressmen and at
least one governor. We also
hope to hold several seminars
or workshops, such as the one
that is planned for the
December meeting, which will
deal with the pros and cons of
the Equal Rights Amendment.

Further club plans include
social activities with area
clubs, such as UVa. and the
establishment of YD clubs at
the area schools, which do not
now have them. They are
preparing for a weekend trip to
D. C. and expect to have an end-
of-the-year banquet. In the area
of legislative affairs, they pro-
pose to lobby for the
decriminalization of mari-
juana.

As it stands now, former Presi-
dent Ben Winn’s prediction of
last year, ‘I think we’re going
to be a growing club,” seems to
bea reality.
