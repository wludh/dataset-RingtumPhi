Parties:

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, NOVEMBER 17, 1977

EC requires accountability

-by Lee Howard

In order, as Rick Goddard
said, to ‘‘tell the student com-
munity what’s going on” the
Executive Committee voted 6-4
to require committee co-
chairmen to ask the EC,s ap-
proval of parties before they
can take place.

Also, it appears that at next
week’s EC meeting, the EC will
vote to take away approximate-
ly half of the funds which re-
mained in the Contact account
during the summer and were
unreported at the budget hear-
ings in September.

Originally, the party vote had
been tied 4-4-2. But one of the
abstainers, EC president Jim
Underhill, then asked the EC
what the reaction of: students
toward parties is. EC vice presi-

Contac ’78

dent George Griffin responded
that many students were
outraged not so much at the
idea of student organizations
having parties as at the idea
that these parties are covered
up by the members of the stu-
dent organizations. He said he
talked to one senior who said
nothing made him madder in
his years at Washington and
Lee than the fact that Contact
had a $115 dinner, partially us-
ing student funds, without
anybody knowing about it.
Griffin said his motion did not
preclude organizations from
having parties, it only made
sure that such parties are
brought out into the open so
students know how their money
is being spent. ‘Personally, I’m
in favor of parties,” Griffin

Kunstler to speak

Contact ‘78 presents William
M. Kunstler, author, educator,
and noted defense attorney for
such personalties as the Ber-
rigan Broghers, H. Rap Brown,
the Attica inmates, the Chicago
7, and Stokely Carmichael.
Kunstler will speak in Lee
Chapel on Thursday, December
1, beginning at 8 p.m.

A man who revels in defen-
ding radicals and underdogs
alike, Kunstler has also been a
distinguished negotiator,
representing the Attica inmates
during the Attica prison
rebellion in September of 1971
and serving as intermediary for
the Mohawk Indians in their
land claim proceeding between
October and November of 1974.

Born in New York City in
1919, Kunstler received a
bachelor of arts degree from
Yale University in 1941. After a
distinguished career in the
United States Army, where he
attained the rank of major and
won the bronze star, Kunstler
attended Columbia Law school,
receiving his degree in 1948. A
year later he became a partner
in the law firm of Kunstler,
Kunstler, Human and Goldberg
in New York. He is currently
head of the Center for Constitu-
tional Rights.

While teaching at various
schools including Columbia
University, New York Law
School, Pace College, and the
New School for Social
Research, Kunstler found time
to write nine books, the last
published in 1966 entitled “‘Deep
in My Heart.” He has written
numerous articles and book
reviews appearing in the Col-
umbia Law Review, Life
Magazine, Rolling Stone, and

the Los Angeles Free Press.

Gaining fame through con-
troversy, Kunstler has received
many awards ranging from Phi
Beta Kappa to the Civil Rights
Award given by the New York
State Bar Association.

Kunstler is a member of
several prominent organiza-
tions including the American
Civil Liberties Union, National
Lawyers Guild, Attica Brothers
Defense League and the United
Prisoners’ Union.

said. He encouraged organiza-
tions such as the Ring-tum Phi
which don’t have parties to
have them. But he said he saw
no reason why students
shouldn’t have an opportunity
to protest the amount spent on
parties.

Griffin’s argument persuaded
the two abstainers, Underhill
and Steve Abraham to vote for
EC approval of parties. Jack
Bovay, Chris Gammon, God-
dard and Griffin also voted for
the proposal. Mike Missal,
Doug Perkins, Jim Davis and
Andy Bodenstab voted against
the proposal. (

The most active opponent of
Griffin’s motion was Missal,
who warned, “‘We’re getting too
overbearing on committees.”
He said the EC has given co-
chairmen responsibilities for
funds and should trust them to
use them properly.

Underhill, at first seeming to
be an opponent of the motion,
said the accounting guidelines,
combined with the oversight by
EC ad hoc members to various
committees should be enough to
ensure against misuse of stu-
dent funds. However, he seem-
ed convinced by Griffin’s argu-
ment that “Looking at the
receipts is after the fact.”’

In this same vein, but before
the EC had voted to make EC
approval of parties necessary,
Contact co-chairman Billy
Webster had said, ‘‘If we decide
to have one (a party), you’ll
know about it,”’ to which God-

Howard Nemerov came to
Washington and Lee, read
selected works and conquered
his audience Tuesday night with
a performance that while long,
revealed the brilliance of his
writing.

The secret of enjoying
Nemerov is simple: as he ex-
plained it, ‘“You have to be nuts
and on my wavelength.” And
during the course of his lecture,
as he “‘stood on (his) hind legs
looking like brown toast”’ in his
burnt orange suit, the audience
was invited to tune into
Nemerov’s frequency.

Nemerov is a master at con-
verting everyday experiences
or simple words into poetry. As
he puts it, “I like poems that
you don’t have to do any fancy
writing, but write what you
have learned about.’’ He admit-

 

[ted his poems are not like,

“You have to be nuts
and on my wave lengt

modern poetry ‘‘because you
don’t have to explain a lot.”

Within his poems is evidenced
a fascination for: bugs—‘‘I sup-
pose if I write an anthology, it
would be called ‘Bugs.’”’;
nature, especially the fall
season; and simple instruments
such as record players.

The simplicity of his writing
is what makes Nemerov’s
works so endearing, such as
describing a record player tone
arm as a traveller who does
nothing while the road goes on,
or describing autumn as the
back side of a tapestry.

Nemerov professes an affini-
ty for the late poet Robert
Frost, with whom he shared
‘sympathetic vibrations.’’
Perhaps the two are, as he call-
ed it, both ‘‘misanthropes’’ but
the joy of Nemerov is the sim-
ple, almost childlike way in
which he sees and describes the
world.

Phi could lose ad money;

editor, business mgr.

dispute

The Ring-tum Phi stands to
lose more than $1,900 in adver-
tising revenue over the rest of
the school year because of a
comment made in the Phi’s
gossip column, “The Nose
Knows,” which disparaged the
quality of clothes sold in Adair-
Hutton, Phi business manager
Pete Goss said at a Publications
Board meeting Monday.

Since the comment appeared
in the Oct. 27 issue Adair-Hutton
has not advertised, despite the
fact that the clothing store’s
manager, Leroy Worley, said
he planned to advertise in every
issue, Goss said. He added that
he had been told by Worley that
the reason Adair-Hutton
withdrew its advertising was
because of the comment made
in the ‘“‘Nose Knows” column.
He said that other clothing
stores had also been reluctant
to advertise since the column
appeared.

Goss, who requested the Mon-
day afternoon meeting, said
that in the seven weeks Adair-
Hutton advertised with the
newspaper it had given the Phi
$578 in revenue. Projecting
from that, he said that the Phi
could lose more than $1,900 if
Adair-Hutton decides not to
advertise the rest of the year.

Phi editor, Mike Gallagher,
admitted allowing the column’s
reference into the newspaper
was “a stupid mistake.’”’ He
said, however, that running a
college newspaper is a learning
process.

Goss replied, ‘‘While you’re
learning, we’re losing advertis-
ing revenue.”’

Other Publications Board

members said that not offen-
ding advertisers is just common

. sense. Grant Leister, Calyx

business manager said, ‘‘That’s
capitalism.’’ ‘“‘Every
newspaperman knows you don’t
print bad things about adver-
tisers,” Calyx editor Temp
Webber said.

Total advertising has dropped
off by about 50 per cent since
the Parents Weekend edition,
Goss said. He said it’s normal
for advertising to drop off
following the Parents Weekend
edition, but not by so much.

Gallagher later pointed out
that last year the paper’s adver-
tising revenue between Parents
Weekend and Dec. 2 also drop-
ped off by 50 per cent.

Gallagher suggested to Goss
that the business manager has
not explored all avenues for
advertisements. He said that
the ROTC department, for in-
stance, has only run one adver-
tisement all year, despite the
fact that it ran ads almost every
week last year. ROTC depart-
ment head, Maj. Adams, has
not even been contacted about
ads since the first week, when
the department ran a full page
advertisement, Gallagher said.

Goss responded that adver-
tisement revenue has been up
significantly this year, and he
has been busy developing na-
tional advertising sources.

Because of the recent un-
foreseeable cut in advertising
revenue as well as higher than
calculated costs for producing
the Phi, Goss asked the Publica-
tions Board to give him more
authority to regulate the size of

dard replied, ‘I hope we know
about it before you have it.”

Co-chairmen Webster and
Walter Granruth told the EC
that more than $800 remained in
three Contact accounts during
the summer. In Contact’s two
accounts at United Virginia
Bank were $466.98, Granruth
said. Additionally, the ¢co-
chairmen found out on the day
of Monday’s EC hearing that
$357.20 was left in Contact’s ac-
count with the university.

Granruth said “It’s kind of
astonishing to me’’ how it got
there. He said that until Mon-
day afternoon he didn’t know
there was any money in the ac-
count. He said that John Bruch,
the past year’s co-chairman
had told him sometime in May
that no money was left in the
university Contact account.

Granruth said Contact needed
money during the summer to
pay for expenses. He said ex-
penses over the summer were
about $285, including $269 which
had to be paid for travel ex-
penses for Vincent Bugliosi, a
Contact speaker. The remain-
ing money went for printing,
telephone and postage ex-
penses, he said.

As to why Contact had not in-
formed the EC of the amount re-

' maining in the Contact account,

Webster said ‘We _ honestly
didn’t think of it.”” He said, “‘It
didn’t cross either of our
minds’’ to include it as possible
revenues. The reason it never
occured to them, said Webster,
was that the two previous Con-
tacts had not included it as part
of revenues.

Griffin denied this, saying
that Bill Flesher and Mike
Monahan, co-chairmen two
years ago, did include their
“reserve fund’ as part of
revenues. Last year only a
nominal sum was left, Griffin
said. Webster said it was about
$80. Goddard said no student
organization should have such a
reserve fund. ‘‘Contact should
be treated the same way’’ as
other organizations, he said,
“any money left over should
revert tous.”

Underhill argued that ‘‘You’d
get a lot of opposition from the
IFC’’ if the EC tried to pass a
motion that would have all
money revert back to the EC
despite the fact the Inter
Fraternity Council gives Con-
tact nearly one third of its
funds.

Goddard then moved that
Contact,s money be split at the
end of the year on a percentage
between the EC and the IFC,

with the parent’s contributions
being split 50-50 between the
two organizations. This motion
was voted down 9-1. However,
another motion by Goddard
which would allow Contact to
keep the 15 per cent the parents
chip in, while the EC and the
IFC get their percentage passed
unanimously.

Following passage of this mo-
tion, Underhill said it stood to
reason that the EC get back its
share of the funds which re-
mained in the Contact account
during the past summer, par-
ticularly since Granruth told
the EC that it received a pledge
of $700 more from the IFC than
it had anticipated and had also
already exceeded anticipated
revenue from parents’ contribu-
tions by about $500. Contact’s
budget anticipated $3,300 from
the IFC and $1,700 from
parents.

Webster argued the cut,
which would amount to about
$400, ‘‘is going to inevitably af-
fect the number and quality of
speakers we produce.” He add-
ied, ‘‘We would not be able to put
‘on a good program.” Speaker
fees have gone way up since last
year, he said.

Underhill said he didn’t: ‘know
how Webster could say that,
particularly since he had
discovered just a few hours ago
$357 he didn’t even know he had.
Also, the extra money from the
IFC and parents came as a sur-
prise, he said.

Webster responded that he
thought assistant treasurer
Louis Snyder must have made a
mistake when he said Contact
had $357 in its university ac-
count. He therefore urged the
EC to table discussion of taking
away Contact funds until the ex-
act amount of money which re-
mained in the Contact account
is verified. The EC decided to
take up the issue next week.

The EC also decided to table
discussion of a motion by God-
dard that defendants in an
honor trial be presented with
copies of the physical evidence
against them. Goddard said the

- EC had to post notices that

discussion of revision of the
white book would occur at the
next EC meeting.

Goddard said the reason he
made his proposal is that, as it
stands now, a defendant can
call for a recess after he has
been presented with the
physical evidence against him.
Why not just give the defendant
the physical evidence against
him prior to a hearing so he can
present his case, Goddard said.

Wind Quintet Performs Today’

by Robert Tremblay

Tonight at 8 o'clock the
Clarion Wind Quintet will per-
form in Lee Chapel.

A solid group of professionals,
the Clarion Wind Quintet has
been performing together for 16
years. From North America to
Europe and to Latin America,
they have been well received.
Each member of the group is an
artist-in-residence at the North
Carolina School of the Arts in
Winston-Salem. In the past,
each instrumentalist has held a
first chair position in major
symphony and chamber or-
chestras as well as journeying
on successful solo careers.

The members of the group
are: Philip Dunigan, flute;
Robert Listokin, clarinet;
Joseph Robinson, oboe; Mark
Popkin, bassoon; and
Frederick Bergstone, horn. If
you wish to purchase any of
their recordings, the quintet ap-
pears on Golden Crest and
Educo Records.

Their concert includes the
music of Ibert, Brahms,
Stewart, Klughardt, and
Hindemith. Jacques Ibert is a
20th century French composer,
but his music is more of a throw
back to the late, Romantics and
the Impressionists than to the
atonality of our age. His Three
Short Pieces will be very
French sounding with smatter-
ings of Debussy and Poulenc ap-
parent throughout. Brahms is,
of course, one of the greatest
composers in the history of
music. He is a late Romantic,

but his music displays” a
classical control and balance
more in tune with Beethbyen
than with Liszt. His Variations
and Fugue on a Theme _ b
Handel, originally writte for

piano, will be arran for
woodwind quintet by . the
group’s bassoonist; | Mark

Popkin. Handel only’ wrote five
variations on this theme, but
Brahms, ever the musical. in-
tellectual, wrote 25, and tops! it
off with a very werful fugue at
the end.

Robert Stewart is professor of
music at Washington and Lee as
well:as a noted composer and
conductor. His Five Visions is a
serial; composition based on a
twelve tone row. The work
dates back to 1960. August
Klughardt is a late Romantic,

but unlike Brahms, I believe
Klughardt’s Quintet op. 79 will
be a piece of displaying more of
a Wagnerian influence. The
final piece on_ the
program,Kleine Kammermusik
(a “Little Chamber Music’’), is
by Paul Hindemith, one of the
giants in 20th century music.
Hindemith, though a bold in-
novator, still had a deep love for
the classical ‘and romantic
styles. This work, a_ true
masterpeicé, should exemplify
both trends, as well as
Hindemith’s own distinct and
personal touch. In the second
movement, by the way, a pic-
colo should replace the flute.

This concert, which, hopeful-
ly, will be well attended, is
sponsored by the Washington
and Lee Concert Guild.

ENTERTAINMENT

UT Presents
The Beaux’ Strategem

 

 

 

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

The University Theatre will
soon present its second play of
the major season, when George
Farquhar’s The Beaux’
Strategem opens Wednesday,
November 30—playing through
Sunday, December 4, directed
by Dr. Al Gordon.

The comedy is part of a
glorious period in English
drama. It dates to 1660, and the
return of the monarchy in the
form of colorful, fun-loving
Charles II. Thirty years of age
and a great lover of the arts, the
bachelor king had a joie de
vivre which went beyond the
bounds of decorum for the usual
British king. But after 18 years
of Puritan restraint, Charles’
escapades were not only
tolerated, but applauded by a
suddenly giddy populace.

This mating of interests—
open views of sex, a craving for
bright wit and repartee, a

‘ cynical attitude toward most of
what is sacred in life—spawned
Restoration comedy. The flood
of interest carried on even after
the death of Charles in 1685; a
“second generation” of writers
emerged to carry on the

‘comedy of manners”’ tradition
of well-ordered lust which the
old king would have loved best.
Among these was Farquhar,
whose career began in the
1690’s.

A great favorite at court, Far-
quhar’s comedies were great
successes for the time;
remember, the theatre-going
public of the time was quite
small, and a run of ten days was
considered phenomenal! In
fact, Farquhar set a length
record, when his play The Cons-
tant Couple ran at Drury Lane
for 53 nights in the 1699-1700
season.

The Beaux’ Strategem comes
at the close of the writer’s
career. Aging and worn out,
Farquhar wrote the comedy for
six weeks on his deathbed, in
1707. As one critic later noted,
“He lived just long enough to
receive the profits from the
third performance (which was
the author’s benefit night), and
to know that its character of
Lady Bountiful had provided
the language with a perfect
synonym for ostentatious chari-
ty.”

The story line of Beaux’
Strategem is a typical one for

the period—a healthy mixture
of romance, adventure, and
cynical comedy. Two Restora-
tion dandies, Aimwell and Ar-
cher (played in the W&L
rpoduction by Chip Hughes and
Taylor Harbison) arrive in the
country from London, scheming
to marry money. Through
various devices, they meet
Lady Bountiful, an _ old
noblewoman, her daughter
Dorinda, and her unhappily-
married daughter-in-law Mrs.
Sullen. A series of romantic in-
trigues develops, but as direc-

Musical Mainstream

by Mark Mainwaring

There’s little doubt that the
Doobie Brothers are one of the
best commercial and singles-
oriented bands around. Judging
by their performance last Sun-
day at the Roanoke Civic
Center, they’re a surprisingly
good live act as well. The group
opened with one of their best-
known songs, ‘China Grove,”
and moved neatly into ‘‘Takin’
it to the Streets.”” From there,
the Doobies proceeded to play
virtually all their hits
(including ‘“‘Long Train Runn-
ing’,” “Black Water,” ‘‘Listen
to the Music’”’ and others), plus
a number or two from their new
album, Living on the Fault
Line. The band was extremely
tight, and its members (not to
mention the crowd) were quite
obviously enjoying themselves.

The real surprize at this
show, though, was the opening
set by Pablo Cruise. With
several extended (but not

monotonous) — instrumental
jams by guitarists Dave
Jenkins and Bud Cockrell, plus
excellent keyboard work from
Cory Lerios, the band’s
members showed that there’s
more to them than just their re-
cent hit single ‘“‘Watcha Gonna
Do.” According to Jenkins, the
success of that song was not a
complete surprise. ‘‘I know it.
was good, because it had a real
strong groove to it, and in-
teresting hooks all the way
through,’’ he said. He also add-
ed, half jokingly, that “the
words were dumb enough to get
across to the people.’’ With con-
siderable pressure on the band
after the commercial success a
A Place in the Sun, it will be in-
teresting to see what Pablo
Cruise comes up with next. Says
guitarist Jenkins, ‘‘All we have
to do is just keep playing our
music. If the next record
doesn’t do as well commercial-
ly, who cares?”

earnings have taken 20th-Fox’s
stock from a low of 9 to its pre-
sent 23, turning the company to
thoughts of huge growth instead
of bankruptcy. Beyond a
shadow of a doubt, Star Wars
will pass Jaws as the top- gross-
ing film of all -time by
December.

No one has ever really
dissected the reasons for this
success. It is common
knowledge in the movie world
that writer-director George
Lucas (of American Graffitti
fame) intended the film to be
solely “‘B”’ quality, making ‘‘B’’
profits. He gave (persuaded? )
Alec Guiness the great old sage,
the future freer of the soul. Deb-
bie Reynolds’ daughter, Carrie
Fisher, was handed the part of
your , basic  beautiful(?),
spunky, liberated princess, and
Mark Hamill was the lucky
recipient of the part of Luke—
every young girl’s heart-throb
hero.

But why such success?

tional Shakespeare Company
will perform ‘‘As You Like It’’
here at Washington and Lee on
December 5.

The SAB decided to bring
the Natinal Shakespeare
Company to Washington and
Lee for the Sunday night per-
formance at its regular meeting
Sunday night. The date for the
performance will not be con-
crete until the final contract is
resolved. The SAB also decided
to hold the play in the gym and
selected a 7:30 curtain time for
the performance.

SAB co-chairman Bill Tucker
said he would like to see the per-
formance be free of charge to
all students and faculty. The
price for the act will cost ap-
proximately $2,000, which will
be absorbed by the SAB’s
general entertainment fund.

Like It’’ over ‘“‘The Winter’s
Tale’ and ‘‘Othello” because
members believed the W&L
community would enjoy a com-
edy more than the other two
choices.

The National Shakespeare
Company visited W&L in
January of 1974 and presented
‘As You Like It’’ then also. The
1974 performance of the play
cost students $2 for admission
and drew a large crowd. The
play was presented in a two act
format with the comedy scenes
exaggerated to a hilarious ex-
tent.

The play itself centers on the
confusion involved in love. The
heroine Rosalind disguises
herself as a man so as to be able
to observe her lover. The result
of her disguise wins the affec-
tion of another girl. As the ac-
tion continues not only are the
roles of the sexes reversed but
the fortunes of the characters

Soccer Team
Regains Pride

by Chris Fay

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team ended the season on a
positive note last Friday. The
Generals beat the University of
North Carolina—Greensboro by
a score of 3 to 1. The Generals,
by winning their last game,
broke their losing streak of
eight games.

Head soccer coach Rolf Pira-
nian said, “I believe it takes a
coach three years to field a
team he wants.”’ The team has
improved the two years Pira-
nian has been coach and he ex-
pects it to improve more next
year. Although several fine

players are leaving this year,
Piranian believes that there
will be little difficulty in fielding
another good team next year.
The soccer players on the varsi-
ty team have improved and
there are several players on
this year’s JV squad who should
be able to move up and fill the
gaps.

However, Piranian also siad,
“I'd be lying if I said I was com-
pletely satisfied’ with this
year’s season. The team lost
four games by one goal. Pira-
nian believes that it wasn’t lack
of effort by the team but too
many bad breaks which caused
some of the disappointment.

Generals Lose Second
Battle of Gettysburg

by Pete Abitante

Behind an offense that rolled
up 427 total yards, Gettysburg
College had little trouble get-
ting by the Generals 28-6 last
Saturday in Gettysburg. While
the Bullet were rolling along,
the Generals could muster only
one first down and 36 yards total
offense in the first half, a pro-
phesy of their doom.

Two instances significantly
limited W&L’s quest to upset
Gettysburg for the second year
in a row. First, senior quarter-
back Ted Hissey, already nurs-
ing a sore shoulder, left the
game on the Generals’ second
possession of the game with an
injured arm. With his departure
went the leadership and passing
attack that has directed many
W&L drives this year.

The second incident, which
may have been the turning
point of the game, came with
less than a minute to play in the
half. W&L was in punt forma-
tion when punter Syd Farrar
bobbled the snap from center
and was forced to run, getting
as far as the General 38—not
enough for the first down. On

Hungry Wrestlers Ready To
Defend ODAC Crown

by Mark Peterson

Poor draws and early season
jitters resulted in a disappoin-
ting start for the wrestling
Generals in the recent Monarch
Open held at ODU on November
11 and 12. Only tri-captain
Howdy Knipp (126) got past his
first round opponent, although
sophomore Ray Gross (142) did
win a consolation match and the
entire team gained valuable
wrestling experience.

The tournament, open to 312
wrestlers, which is more than
are invited to the Division III
nationals, included such Divi-
sion I eastern powerhouses as
West Chester St., NC St., UNC,
William and Mary, and Lehigh.

Despite their slow start, the
hopes of the team are not at all
dampened as they prepare to
defend their ODAC crown. Led
by tri-captains Howdy Knipp
‘78, Ed Rodgers ‘79 and Dan
Kniffin ‘79, five other returning
lettermen and an impressive
array of veterans and
freshmen, the team is looking
forward to a second consecutive
ODAC championship, and im-
provement on last year’s 10-3
duel meet record and many im-
pressive victories in the six
tournaments entered this year.

The starting team, featuring
seven lettermen, two varstly
improved upperclassmen, and
one highly touted freshman,
promises to be one of the
strongest Washington and Lee
has fielded in many years.

Beginning his fourth year at
118 lbs. is senior tri-captain
Howdy Knipp, a _ former

Association champion, was
runner-up in the ODAC last
year, and if early season
workouts mean anything,

Tri-captain Ed Rodgers, a
junior, is one of the two return-
ing ODAC champions on the
Generals. He is moving up from
150 lbs. to 158 in hopes of mat-
ching last year’s excellent tour-
nament record while improving
on his dual meet record.

Kniffen, the third member of
the Generals captains’ club is
also changing weight class this
year moving down from
heavyweight to 190 Ibs.
Although he won’t join the team
until the end of football season,
he is being counted on to pro-
vide many victories this year.

In addition to an outstanding

have a powerful reserve corps.

the next play, Gettysburg
quarterback Bob LeComte
found halfback Dave Natale
streaking down the sideline for
a 38 yard scoring strike. Thus,
what looked like a 9-0 Get-
tysburg halftime lead quickly
turned out to be 15-0, with W&L
set to receive the second half
kickoff.

Gettysburg had scored its
first touchdown of the day at the
4:05 mark of the first quarter as
LeComte hit runningback Jim
Bixby with a 7 yard pass. The
conversion failed, but Rick Ep-
pleman kicked a 36 yard field
goal in the second quarter for
the 9-0 lead.

Freshman quarterback Chris
Leiser, the third General
quarterback of the day, started
the second half and led the team
on what turned out to be its only
touchdown of the afternoon.
Capitalizing on a fumbled Get-
tysburg punt return, Leiser

‘ drove the Generals 33 yards in
six plays, capping the drive
himself on a 12 yard run. Karl
Cheatham’s attempted two
point conversion run failed.

Theoretically, the Generals
were still in the game at this
point, but statistically they
were outclassed. The offense
could manage only 51 yards
rushing—24 of which Leiser
gained.

As to the passing attack,
quarterbacks Hissey, Swope,
and Leiser completed only 5 of
16 attempts for 79 yards. Three
of those passes were to flanker
Richie Wiles, good for 47 yards,
thus increasing his season total
to 36 receptions and 500 yards.

The only other bright spot of
the game was the play of cor-
nerback Jack Norberg, who ac-
counted for 114 yards on two
punt and four kickoff returns. In
addition, he blocked two kicks.

The defense had one of its
most dismal days ever, allow-

_ ing the Bullets an average of 5.1
yards per play and 278 yards on
the ground.

With the temperature dropp-
ing and the snow falling more

steadily, the game was placed
out of reach when Gettysburg
scored two fourth quarter
touchdowns—salting its third
win of the year, 28-6.

This Saturday, the Generals
close out their season against
former club team Georgetown
University. For seven seniors,
it will be their last game. Co-
captains Marc Duncan and Jeff
Slatcoff, a potential All-
American linebacker, quarter-
back Ted Hissey, halfback Ed
Johnson, tight end Bob
“Chooser’’ Szczecinski, split
end Bill Frear, and punter-
defensive back Phil Bailey will
all be playing their last game on
Wilson Field. It would be fitting
to go out with a win for these
seven, and to do that they will
have to beat a mediocre but
steadily improving Georgetown
team.

The Hoyas, coming off a 42-13
victory over Manhattan last
Saturday are now 2-6 on the
year. Their only other win was
against Galludet, while the best
competition they have faced
was Fordham who, while
beating Georgetown 40-0, lost
convincingly to Davidson.

The Generals annihilated the
Hoyas last year 43-12 at
Georgetown so they should be
ready for W&L. While a win
would not redeem the entire
season, for many, it would
mean a fond memory to reflect
on for years to come.

W&L Swimmers Flex
Muscles At Meet

The W&L varsity swimming
team flexed its muscles in an
early test of their strength by

Cagers Shoot For 2nd ODAC Title

by Mark Mitchell

“We should have a better
team than last year’s even
though we probably won’t have
as good a record,” says head
basketball coach Verne Can-
field.

A daring statement coming
from a man who has lost five
players to graduation, including
the two best rebounders and
three of the top four scorers
from last year’s team.

There are reasons for op-
timism, however. All three
returning starters are
acknowledged to be excellent
players and all three have im-
proved. The most noticeable
player will be senior guard and
super shooter (57.4 per cent
from the field last year) Pat
Dennis. Dennis moves very well
without the ball, can post, as
well as launch rockets from 30
feet, and is an excellent offen-
sive rebounder. He has been
working on his stamina so that
he will be able to play more
minutes this year. By playing
more minutes, he will be able to
put up even more than the 478
shots (220 more than any other
returning player) that he put up
last year. His defense has also
improved. Although he will still
have trouble once his man gets
the ball, he helps out well on
defense and plays good zone
defense.

Although Dennis may be the
most noticeable player on the
team, junior Dave Leunig will
probably be the most valuable.
He is a player who gives 110 per
cent and he has improved every
year. One statistical indication
of his improvement is that his
shooting percentage last year
was ten points higher than in his
freshman year. He will be
valuable, not only because he is
the Generals’ best all-around
player, but also because he is
the most versatile player,
capable of playing all three
front line positions. On defense,
he will usually cover the other
team’s best forward. He re-
bounds, shoots, defends and
passes excellently. Un-
fortunately, he also fouls—
leading the team in fouls and
disqualifications last year.

At point guard, junior Mike
Wenke, who has set several
W&L assist records, returns.
This year, however, oppoents
will have to guard more than his
passes. Last year, Wenke took
half as many shots as any other

get double figure scoring from
the point guard position. The
result will be more shooting and
driving by Wenke and more ex-

‘ ¢itement for the fans. Wenke

year), he just didn’t. He is a

weakness is that he often gets

than his man.

suited for this job as Canfield
has claimed that Ardith has the
potential to be the best defen-
sive rever coached.

However, Coach Canfield
usually uses eight to ten players
a game so the performance of
the bench will have a great deal
to do with this year’s success.
Canfield is optimistic about the
bench, feeling that the team
“‘has potentially the best depth
we’ve ever had.”’ Well, maybe.

known only for his spectacular
lay ups, has been a pleasant
surprise. He has looked sensa-
tional in practice, using his
quickness to effectively keep
the ball away from his man. His
only problems seem to be defen-
sive rebounding (he seems to be
relying too much on his great
leaping ability rather than
establishing postion) and his
tendency to use up his dribble
prematurely or be caught up in
the air with no place to throw
the ball. These problems are
minor and correctable which
explains why this small forward
is the sixth man.

Point guard is another very
deep position. Senior co-captain
Bobby Forlenza, a former
starter who has proven himself
under fire, backs up Wenke.
Forlenza has had such a good
pre-season that W&L’s point
guard of the future, Pete Far-
rell, a talented speedster who
can play, won’t.

Replacing Dennis at shooting
guard is perhaps W&L’s most
physically talented player—
Thomas Jeffries (T.J.). T.J. is
quick and can sky. In the past
weeks, he has made great pro-
gress in playing the ball-denial,
helping defense that the
Generals play. However, he has
two counts against him. His
natural position is not shooting
guard, but forward, and he is
having to change his one-on-one
style to conform to Canfiled’s
more restricted style. Never-
theless, he has the potential to
be an awesome defensive
player, quick enough to deny his
man the ball, and a good enough
leaper to block shots when he
helps out.

Presently, he is doing well
enough to keep freshman Karby
Hoy, the leading scorer in
Delaware last year, behind
him. At strong forward, big,
(6’5”’, 205 Ibs.) physical Jim
Berlin replaces Larry Meyer.
Although not a scorer, Berlin
rebounds well at both ends of
the floor, sets a mean screen,
passes well and helps out on

defense. He only needs to front
his man more on defense, and
he has shown improvement in
this area.

Depth at center is the area in
which there were the most wor-
ries earlier this year. Two of the
team’s three centers graduated
last year and the one that re-
mained was very prone to foul-
ing. Help came from unex-
pected spots—Chris Ware, a
sophomore who did not try out
last year and Bob Smitherman
(‘String’), a freshman. They
are an interesting pair—Chris is
shorter, but very strong, Bob is
not strong, but is 6’7’’, with very
long arms. Neither has had the
year of training necessary to be
fundamentally solid, but they
both work hard. Their con-
tinued development will be im-
portant to the team’s success.

The offense differs from last
year’s. The ball is being moved
up the floor more quickly in
order to initiate the ‘‘early of-
fense,’’ if the opponent’s
defense is not set. This is not to
imply that the Generals are
running-and-gunning or being
more careless with the ball. The
team is as conscious of avoiding
turnovers on offense as it is of
forcing turnovers on defense.
When a team shoots 50.2 per
cent from the floor as the
Generals did last year, the team
wants to get a shot off on every
possession. Thus, the early of-
fense is really a set play. It
should capitalize on the fact
that Collins will usually beat his
man up the court. Most of the
time, however, the defense will
be set and the Generals will call
a play.

The main difference in the
plays this year is that the center
has been moved up high, free-
ing the area under the basket
for quick posts and flash pivots
by Meyer, Dennis, Leunig,
Williams, and T.J., all of whom
are very effective scorers and
rebounders down low. The point
guard is also presented with
more scoring opportunities this

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Turkey dribble

In three class days the doors of this fine institution
will close for a short breather. For many who can’t
wait, a mass exodus from these hallowed halls will
begin tomorrow. After ten weeks of school, students
need a break. We need time to relax and spent the
holiday with our families and enjoy some birds (both
fowl and female).

Thanksgiving comes at just the right time. Its com-
ing gives students a rest before exams. It gives facul-
ty a chance to escape the monotony of teaching the
same course for the 33rd time in as many years.
Romeos can go home to sooth their Juliets hurt feel-
ings and reaffirm the agreement that was made at the
August parting.

The only problem, or perhaps it is a blessing, is
‘“‘Juliets” rarely become ‘rack dates” (a mere
substitution of ‘‘car’’ for “rack” can be made, but
something gets lost in the translation).

Mom and Dad will be waiting at the front door with
a piece of cheese cake in their hands. The house will
be warm; the food will be good; the beds will be made
and clean. Spot will wag his tail the whole time you
are home and Sis will expertly apply back massage
after back massage. The atmosphere will be perfect
for some catch up studying, though it is doubtful any
will be done.

The dreams of hometown parties which have been
occuring in heads since September will finally come
true. For many, old friendships will appear just
that—old. But for others, Thanksgiving presents the
opportunity to see friends who have meant so much,
to relive old times, and become melacholy over
several emptied pitchers. (For those to the left, the
past will be melancholically remembered over a new
batch of ‘“‘home-grown.”’)

Besides an escape from the books, Thanksgiving
provides the means of escape from other things. The
members of Contact, the E.C., and'S.A.B. can escape
from the spotlight in which they have found
themselves this year. The football team can escape
from a very bad showing and season. The SAF’s can
escape the blowings of the ‘“‘Nose.” The ‘pseudo
preps’’ can take off their khakis and alligator belts.
The Lexington police can put their pens and pads
down for a week. Dan Beyer can go back to Albion.
And the Ring-tum Phi editorial staff can take a vaca-
tion from all the flack that seems to be fired at them
from everywhere. Life is so simple.

Have a good Thanksgiving holiday.

EC Member
Clarifies Stand

To the Editor:

As its November 7 meeting.
the Executive Committee refus-
ed to formally declare that
spending student money for
parties or dinners without prior
EC approval always constitutes
an honor violation. This ap-
parent retreat from respon-
sibility should not’ be
misunderstood by chairmen
and treasurers of organizations
receiving student monies. The
EC allocates money each year
to student groups which have
made specific proposals as to
the use of those funds, proposals
designed to benefit the entire
student body. The Committee
entrusts money to the chairmen
and treasurers with the direc-
tive that the funds’ be used for
the stated purposes only. Strict
accounting guidelines adopted
this year and applied to every
student organization will enable
the EC to monitor all spending.
The Committee will not tolerate
spending for purposes other
than those authorized, and
chairmen and treasurers know
that they will be held personally
responsible for any unauthoriz-
ed or improper spending.

Mr. John Bruch and others
will be unhappy with this policy.
Bruch fails to realize that the
EC is not bound to give Contact
or any other organization any
student money. Last year, the
EC provided 53 per cent of Con-
tact’s total budget. If Contact or
any other group accepts student
money, it takes the funds with
all responsibilities imposed by
the EC. If Bruch or any other
student cannot deal with those
responsibilities, he need not ac-
cept the money. Bruch has
argued that a past practice of
Contact was to hold a party or
dinner for its members
‘“‘because we deserved it.’ This
practice of spending with im-
punity is at an end. Students
who claim the right to spend
student funds on themselves ‘‘at
our discretion’’ have no place in
student financial affairs. Those

who act on that “right’’ in the
future will not be tolerated in
the W&L community.

Remodeled
Co-op disliked

Dear Editor:

I am surprised that the
“remodeling” of the Co-op has
gone unprotested. I find the
changes to be haphazard and
whimsical. Talking with fellow
students confirms my observa-
tions. And rather than list all of
the changes that have
depreciated the quality of the
Co-op, I will name only several
of the major ones.

First, the claim that there has
not been. a decrease in the
seating area is a blatant lie. The
change has made the Co-op a
less attractive place to visit.
And I think I can judge because
I believe, have spent more time
in there than Mr. Darrell ever
will. Second, changing the style
of service and reducing the
variety of food has made me
search elsewhere for more
palatable snacks. I cannot even
get a coke. When I questioned
Mr. Darrell on this point, he
cited limited space and further
said it was his choice. I suggest
his choice was arbitrary and
capricious. Further, a good
breakfast of eggs or a cup of
coffee that is not in a styrofoam
cup can no longer be bought.
Also, the cafeteria style does
not expedite service; we still
have to wait to pay for food. The
bottlenecks have not been
eliminated, just moved. Third,
the change in the supply store
hours have only inconvenienced
us. And further to accuse the
students of stealing $10,000
seems irrational if we are
honorable men. How much of
that was due to poor bookkeep-
ing? In addition, there are no
magazines, and I would suggest
that volume is down because we
students are extremely _in-
convenienced and cannot pur-
chase needed school supplies at

positively revolting and don’t
belong in any newspaper pur-
porting to deal with news and
not with this sinful trash. The
very idea of a grown man tak-
ing advantage of a drunk
woman and removing her
clothes (and actually throwing
them out the window) for sexual
intentions is unheard of where I
come from and I can tell you
right now that no respectable
W&L gentleman has_ even
thought of this idea let alone
perform this heinous act. The
poor girl was a victim of a
diseased mind who had no con-
ception of love whatsoever, but
only of raw, unadulterated, and
unholy sex! This sickness does
not belong in a newspaper, but
in the fires of hell and I am
writing to you to protest so that
this filth is not seen again. By
the way, the other reason I’m
writing to you is that if this
forementioned girl wants her
clothes back, I’ll be happy to
return them to her, but I’m
keeping her bra and panties.

Prudently yours,
Jay Korn

 
Play opens after Thanksgiving

(continued from page 3)
tor Gordon points out, “The
plot, though it may have been
complicated, was rarely the
pivotal facet of these comedies.
Rather, the plot was used to
support funny characters,

brilliant one-liners, and farcial -

situations.”’
Filled with unforgetable.

characters—heroes and villains
alike—the play ends in
characteristically happy
fashion. True love previals and
the villains are foiled—and all
are a little wiser in the ways of
human folly. It is truly ‘‘an ex-
uberant, lusty, refreshing
piece.”’

In speaking aobut his play,
Dr. Gordon commented, ‘‘It is a
show perfect for the
Troubadour facility, an_ in-
timate playhouse certainly
‘reminiscent of the theatres of
the day. We have taken this
basic advantage, and have add-
ed as many ‘extrag’ as possible,
in order to datch'the flavor of
the 18th century.There will be
songs at intermission’ with
orange-girls paddling their
wares, as was done in the real
theatres. And, we are even
planting our’ owfi’ ‘audience’ in
the sideboxes. They will not on-
ly react to the ‘play in typical
fashion, but willcarry on a few
intrigues of their own...”

UT fans will also be in-
terested to note ‘the return of
Dr. Shillington to the boards, as
the innkeeper Boniface, after
his show-stopping appearance
in Uncle Vanya last season.
And, as a special added attrac-
tion, the head of the drama
department himself, Prof. Lee
Kahn, will be returning trium-
phantly to the stage after a
twenty-year sabbatical, to play
the ‘‘dirty old man in the upper
box.”

It seems as though the watch-
cry of this play is going to be
“‘fun.’”’ If you are bored by the
sighing Russians of Chekhov, or
disgusted by the blasphemies of
Albee, this breezy comedy is
probably the show to
see...Beaux’ Strategem is a
perfect example of the so-called
“transition play.’’ Stanind mid-
way as it does between the
cynical attitudes of the Restora-
tion, and the pious sentiment
which was soon to follow in the
later 1700’s, the comedy is a

marvel of balance. The rake
and the honorable man will both
‘find happiness here. It will,
above all, be a show devoted to

With time running out in the
fourth year, graduation seemed
a long shot for the Barrel. It was
thought hopeless just three
weeks ago, compounded by no
muscle tone, sneakers too big,
and an athletic prowess match-
ed by Gerald Ford. But with the
aid of Coach Abby and Trainer
Strange, Barrel turned in a
11:36 six lap performance as
sizzling as a T-bone.

Lord McMillan of the Rhodes
Scholarship Committee called it
‘‘a most amazing athletic
achievement.’”’ Similarly, the
parents of the ‘rotund wonder,’
who thought their $20,000 invest-
ment was down the drain, com-
mented, ‘‘can you believe this
kid!.....0h, I wish I would have
been there.”’

Most relieved of all though
was Barrel’s flaming wonder,
who said, ‘‘aw, aw, aw.”’

When seeing Star Wars, you
. must release yourself to a
regression in your
psychological attitudes. The
heroes that you have been told
no longer exist must be able to
re-enter your thought process.
You must be free to stare in awe
and let emotions ride on fan-'
tasy. In short, you must let
yourself become a kid again.

After the outset, this becomes
very easy. The special effects
capture and hypnotize easily.
Perhaps this is because the
special effects are actually real
within the context of the presen-
tation (which can be ex-
emplified by the realization that
there actually exists old space
ships). What Star Wars does is
capture the imagination. You
know what the ending will be a
half-hour ahead of time, but
you're captive anyway.

In sum, you will find most of
those who found the rest of the
movie as poor as I found the
first five minutes are either (1)
40 years older’ than their
chronological age, or (2) over 40
and ulcer infested. Star Wars is
a fantasy. Fantasies are for the
young.

It’s to America’s credit that
most of its people are still young
enough to fantasize.

the paper. Goss said _ the
previous week he had only
managed to get a little over one
page of advertisements, yet
when he_ requested that
Gallagher only put out an eight
page paper, he was rebuffed.
Lee Howard, news editor of
the Phi, said the reason Goss
had been rebuffed was that he
had waited until the last minute
to tell the news staff that a 12
page paper was economically
unfeasible. By that time stories
had already been written, and
there were a good 12 pages of

added that if the Phi did not
print some of the stories which
reporters had spent a lot of time
working on, the newspaper
might lose the enthusiasm of its
reporters.

Gallagher went on to em-
phasize that he wants to have 12
pages every week, and that it’s
up to the business manager to
find enough advertising to pay
for the paper. He said that Goss
had budgeted for a 12 page
paper and if he wasn’t sticking
within his budget, it was not the
fault of the news staff.

staff was frequently hitting the
maximum figure which the
business manager of the News-
Gazette, E. S. Humphreys,
quoted to him for production of
the paper. He said that is
because there is too much copy
and not enough pictures and
advertisements. The latter cost
less to produce, he said.

Gallagher said the news staff
is getting its copy in on time and
there hasn’t been any overtime
pay since the second issue; he
suggested that Goss go down
and talk to Humphreys.

It was decided by the board
that Goss and Gallagher go to
see Humphreys together. It was
also decided that Goss and
Gallagher get together every
Friday night at 5 o’clock to
decide what size the paper is go-
ing to be. This will give the news
staff plenty of warning as to
how many stories to assign,
Ryland Owen, president of the
Publications Board said.

Owen said it was ‘“‘embarass-
ing’ that Goss and Gallagher
had to come to the board to
work out things which should
have been worked out between
them in private.

In other action by the board,
it voted 7-3 to pay the Phi $33.73

Berley made on behalf of the
board and the university to try
to avoid a libel suit. Also, Neil
Pentifallo was asked to be the

year.

At the other end of the floor,
the Generals will again use six
different defenses. This year,
like last year, the primary
defense will be pressure man-
to’’man. Although they will pro-
bably play more zones this
year, the main difference is that
they plan to execute their
man’’to-man defense hetter this
year.

They must force more tur-
novers and disrupt opposing of-
fenses more. if they are to be as
good a team as last year’s.
There are two main reasons for
this argument: it is doubtful
that they can equal last year’s
record 50.2 per cent field goal
percentage and record free
throw percentage, after losing
three people who were in-
strumental in setting those
records. And last year, they out-
rebounded their opponents by a
record margin. This year, miss-
ing their two best rebounders,
the rebounding, especially
defensively, is a question mark.

However, it remains to be seen «
whether the better weak side |

defense, which is so necessary

for improving the defense will

_ materialize.

Fortunately, the team has un-
til late February to put it all
together. If past history is any
indication, a 40 per cent winning
percentage will get a team into
the ODAC tournament. Once in
the tournament, a team has on-
ly to win two games to get into
the ODAC tournament, and if
this unified, hard-working team
continues to improve (and there
is no reason to believe that it
will not), the team could get in-
to the NCAA _fournament.
